Inter-rail
In the last few years a new word
has entered the language.
'I'm going Inter-railing this
summer', you will have heard
people say. And there are few
better ways of spending a
summer.
The inter-rail card costs jurt
over £100 for a month and
entitles you to free railway travel
in most of the countries of
Europe and Scandanavia. The
route is entirely up to you. You
can go wherever you fancy, and
wherever an appropriate train
will take you. You can sleep on
the train overnight and wake up
in a new city every morning. If
you find somewhere you
particularly like you can stay
there for a few days, using it as a
base to explore the surroundings
by 'free train.
Every inter-railer has their
favourite place which 'musn't be
missed'. For me it is Budapest,
the captial of Hungary. To go to
Budapest is to take a step
backwards in history—it is a/in-
de-siecle Vienna, not preserved
in mothballs, but full of a bustling
and friendly populace. It is still
possible to eat like a king in one
of Buda's many fine restaurants,
seranaded by gipsy musicians,
and it won't set you back more
than £5 for a three-course meal
with wine and a taxi back to your
hotel. Oh, and the youth hotels
are about £1.50/night for a
shared room. Don't worry about
the language .problem—German
is the second tongue throughout
Eastern Europe.
A certain amount of planning
helps before you set off on your
holiday. Make sure you have
visas for all the countries you
might visit. Make sure you find
out rates of exchange as
well—some one will try to rip you
off. (Not just abroad, either. I saw
someone hand over $90 at
Charing Cross—they got £15
back.)
Another decision to be made is
who to go with. My own view is
that it's best to go inter-railing
alone. You meet far more
people, you go exactly where
you want, and there are no
arguments. In fact half the fun for
the lone inter-railer is watching
groups of 'bosom-pals' having
raging rows about what to do.
Inter-rail tickets are available
price £119 from the STA Office
JCR (above Southside Shop, as
from July 1). You will need your
passport when you buy the
ticket, and every time you use it.
It entitles you to half-price travel
in the UK and on Sealink.

STA Handbook
The first starting-point for that
world tour you've promised
yourself is almost certain to be
the STA office in the JCR. While
you're in there it would be foolish
not to pick up a copy of their new
Let's Go handbook. It contains
60-odd glossy, colour splashed
pages crammed full of facts and
prices. Did you know that you
can fly from London to Karachi
and back for as little as £336? It
takes a lot of saving I know, but
what a story to tell the
grandchildren...
The handbook starts by
launching into a country-by-
country lowdown giving good
points, bad points and costs. The
countries are arranged in what
might be called 'order of
easiness', starting with Greece
and Spain (which are easy to get
to and cheap) working up to
South-East Asia and Australia
(which aren't).
After that there is a good
general section on visas,
innoculations, insurance and the
like. It also has a nifty little check-
list of things you should take
which could avoid embarrassing
little incidents like arriving at the
East/West Berlin border and
finding that you've fogotten your
passport. Lastly all those
abbreviations that travel agents
love to use are explained.
The author obviously has a
sense of humour, and it is small
enough to carry with you—early
field-testing of one of the first
issues also revealed that it can be
drooled over with total discretion
during lectures.
About the only blemishes that
were apparent were a mildly
sexist ad on page 2 from BCal,
the lack of captions for the
photographs (where is that
sunset on page 24?), and the fact
that I'm not going to be able to
visit every one of the 457 places
that have caught my eye while
reading it.
And you don't even have to
buy it.
