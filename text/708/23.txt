Reggae at
the Palace
To many people the summer means massive open
air pop concerts. The combination of good music
and sun is almost irrestible. So which concert
should you go to this summer?
B r u c e S p r i n g s t e e n ' s chart success recently with
concerts at Wembley have
b e e n h y p e d o u t of a l l
proportion. It seems amazing
that such a bland American
rock singer can sell so many
tickets. The Live Aid concert
could well be as much of a rip
off as the Montreaux P o p
Festival where all the major
groups mime their most
recent hit for the TV cameras
in a sort of mega Top of the
Pops. Knebw'orth is only
worth going to if you enjoy
having your mind blasted to
pieces. However Sunsplash is
the one event not to be
missed.
Music critics keep telling us
that reggae is about to take
over from soul as the hippist
music around. Recent chart
successes for Smiley Culture
and Barrington Levy suggests
that the record buying public
may be starting to appreciate
good reggae music. Live
reggae however is still to
reach a mass a u d i e n c e .
Reggae is the sort of music
which should really be heard
live to be appreciated. The raw
enthusiasm of the performers
combines with the normally
ecstatic c r o w d to make
r e g g a e g i g s a u n i q u e
experience.
Sunsplash is probably the
biggest festival of reggae
every to have ever been held
outside J a m a i c a . C a p i t a l
Radio have brought many of \
the worlds top reggae acts to
London as part of their music
festival. B a n d s a p p e a r i n g
include Third World who have
had hits in the clubs, as well as
in the reggae charts, with
singles such as Now That
We've Found Love and more
recently Sense of Purpose.
Arrow whose underated
single Hot, Hot, Hot should
have a major summer hit. The
master of, rapid-style toasting
Smiley Culture, who had a
Police Officer, Sly and Roby,
Gregory Isaacs, Sugar Minott
and Maxi Priest to name but a
few. The show will be hosted
by David Rodigan, the DJ who
presents Capital R a d i o ' s
S a t u r d a y n i g h t r e g g a e
programme and Barry G, a DJ
from K i n g s t o n , J a m a i c a .
There will almost certaintly be
a 30,000 plus crowd, so that
the atmosphere should be
something else.
The festival should provide a
real opportunity to sample live
reggae music.
Why not listen to David
Rodigan on Capital or Tony
Williams on Radio London or
the excellent Rankin' Miss P
on Radio One and find out
exactly why Sunsplash should
be such essential entertain-
ment?
