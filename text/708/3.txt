Imperial wins
wine trophy
IMPERIAL COLLEGE won the
Peter Dominic inter-university
wine tasting competition last
Wednesday, beating five other
universities in the final. Each IC
team member won a magnum of
Chateau Lafite 1975.
The teams f r o m B a t h ,
Southampton, York, Birming-
ham and Edinburgh had all
previously won their regional
finals before coming to IC to
compete in the final.
The competitiors tasted eight
wines, all from the Peter Dominic
list, and had to identify country,
district, sub-region, grape
variety, vintage, and if possible
the name of the wine. The most
readily identifiable was a 1976
Rioja, and the most difficult a
1982 Mersault. Out of a possible
total of 800 points, IC scored 294,
Southampton 261 and Bath 256.
Team member Mark Masento
said that his magnum of Lafite
1975 will be 'laid-down' for a few
years. Lafite is the finest of the
clarets, and one of the world's
great wines.

Anthony Broadbent, was unfortunately unable to compete.

D R P J F I N L E Y of the Aeronautics Department got rather more than
he bargained for when he attended an end-of-term presentation. A
young lady presented herself to him, semi-naked.
It seems that some of his students clubbed together to hire a strip-o-
gram.
A n enterprising photographer captured the event on celluloid, and
made it clear to D r Finley that either he gave him a first or the picture
would appear in F E L I X .
The unbribable Finley wisely chose the latter course.
