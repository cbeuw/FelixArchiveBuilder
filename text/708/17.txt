Tunnel
Vision
TUNNELS HAVE BEEN a
source of fascination for
students at IC for years. A
network of tunnels existed
underneath the old Imperial
Insitute, which was situated on
the site of what is now the
Sherfield Building/Queens
Lawn. A map was printed in
FELIX in 1957, along with a
rather jaunty article which shows
that even then, students found
the lure of the caverns
irresistible. Two years earlier,
FELIX had reported that there
was an unexploded bomb in a
blocked-off section of tunnel.
This was published less than ten
years after the end of the Second
World War, and seems to be
based on eye-witness accounts.
If it was a hoax, then it was
certainly a very elaborate one.
The bomb was said to be of
about 2501bs, and to be located
under the steps leading to the
Royal Albert Hall, beside the east
wing of the Beit building.
Of course the massive
rebuilding work during the
creation of the modern College
buildings meant that many of the
old tunnels were in the way of the
deep foundations that are
required for tall structures. At
one time the pedestrian subway
from South Kensington station
ended near the Royal Albert Hall
garages. The excavations
required for the Mechanical
Engineering building meant that
the tunnel had to be made to
terminate at the Post
Office/Science Museum exit.
One of the short lengths of
tunnel under Prince Consort
Road was made up from the old
subway, and was later used as a
rifle range. Access was from the
Royal School of Mines building
(Goldsmiths extension).
But the new buildings required
tunnels of their own. Power

A typical IC tunneller
cables, telephone wires and
steam pipes are all best hidden
underground. Thus the present
maze of underground pasage-
ways evolved. The tunnels are
the arteries of the College. At all
hours of the day and night, they
transmit the vital services and
information that keep the
College running. Many are
merely short, wide corridors
joining together the basements
of neighbouring buildings.
Others are true tunnels—long,
low, maybe winding, and often
unbearably hot, because of the
super-heated pipes they carry.
The tunnels are permanently lit,
day and night, and are generally
concrete lined. Possibly the
deepest point in the first level of
tunnels is under Exhibition Road,
where they go about 50 feet
below the surface.
Many of the nocturnal visitors
who have tramped these
underground passageways have
left their mark. Often just a name
and a date, but sometimes
something a little more ornate. In
the basement of the Aeronautics
Department, at the entrance to
one of the tunnels, there are
some excellent portraits done in
coloured chalk on the wall.
It is a constant source of
surprise to many that the tunnels
are very easy to enter. No
attempt has been made by
College Security to restrict
access. It is much easier to gain
nightimes access to the tunnels
than to the C h e m i c a l
Engineering Department, for
instance. This clearly makes a
complete mockery of the whole
College 'Security' system. They
guard locked doors 24 hours a
day—and leave the tunnels
gaping open for all to use. Even
locked doors aren't much
deterent when they are
unattended. The ASSA lock
system was installed more than
twenty years ago—and has been
well and truly breached. The
number of R37 master keys
sculling around is a standing
joke. A professional security firm
reckoned that in a institution the
size of IC, the lock system should
be changed every five years. And
the longer you leave a system
after five years, the more
expensive it is to replace.
The College have tried to
respond by installing electical
key-cards in some doors, in
addition to the ASSA locks.
These are so unreliable that
people go to great lengths to
prop them open—if they cannot
get in then they smash the door
down. Great security, eh?
