* * * GOING OUT
Miles Davis - dear-oh-dear-oh-dear
There is that in people, the will
to place everything in neat
little boxes. One persons
personality, summed in a
small box. Placed here, in
another box, his home his
friends and the city busy,
raging around outside it all.
The play starts in confusion
and echos instantly rendering
this desire useless, boxes
caught up in strands and'
feelings.
It starts all wrong! She
doesn't love him at first when
he sees her flirt passed one
day. He, the prince of Cleves,
has a friend, the Duke of
Nemours, and they are in love!
The Prince becomes devoted
to the girl he saw and they
marry, she might grow to love
him. But the Duke has seen
her too and he is slowly to
become obsessed with her.
Her mother protective, but still
this- can not halt the tragic
story as she starts to love the
Duke and is torn between guilt
and desire.
It is too much, there is no
peace and time to be alone,
watched and desired const-
antly be one of the men, her
mother or her friend too who
plays a voyeur role moving
between all the characters.
She asks to leave for the

country, but returns soon with
her dieing mother and the
Duke waiting for her.
The Princess is, perhaps,
more ruled by her mother than
might be shown, as later she
still manages to influence her
even after her death. She tells
her daughter to love the Duke.
T h e real c o m e d y — t h e
irony—of the play is with held
right up until theend when the
Duke has finally grasped the
princess at the expense of his
friend who watches them two,
only to find out what she is
really like and that he could
never love her. Comedy used
to hit home the real tragedy
a n d waste of the plot.

almost, a technique not yet
used to its full potential,
leaving you only to sure that
there is a difference between
obsession and real love. It is
really a make up of both these
extremes of emotions; a very
personal thing, yet infect-
uous, causing each member
of the cast to mistrust and
eventually haunt each other.
The play appears const-
antly full of echos which
enhances the inability of the
box characters—perhaps real

death when they return from
the country is followed by the
princes illness. At one point
the mother is talking about an
old escort friend she used to
have, then later the Duke
momenterialy fills this role
until he is noticed by the

obvious to be co-incidences;
but then how often do we
think it in real life?
The whole play is shrouded
in a unique atmosphere, partly
because of the stuttered
action and comedy but mainly
due to the mysteries of stage

lighting taken from a huge
variety of lamps most of which
appear actually on the stage.
Too, the 'Designer Label' set
of clothes and chairs adding
the final touch to the princes
home, a sweeping staircase,
and the whole atmosphere of
the play.

Pirates off parade
Summer sounds appear dire
in the extreme for the next few
weeks with three of London's
major pirate radio stations,
Solar, Horizon and Skyline,
temporarily off the air. This
comes in the wake of a new
pirate of the airwaves, K Jazz
on 93.8 FM, broadcasting jazz
of every calibre between
10.00am and 10.00pm on
Sundays alone. Time was
when G//es Petersen used to
play all this for us, but
Horizon, now mute, thought
better of him. That'll teach
'em.
