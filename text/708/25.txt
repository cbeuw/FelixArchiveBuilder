The truth about this
year's FELIX editor...
Wild
Rowe-ver
A man 30 years too young for his age, with an
attitude more suited to editing 'The Tatler',
David Rowe is the definitive young fogey.
His penchant for tweed jackets, cricket, fine
wines and cheeses is only matched by his
distaste of all that is modern. Indeed, it is his
ambition to be remembered as Imperial
College's answer to Noel Coward.
Before his election as editor, David was
renouned for his caustic wit, a lack of money
and a liking of a night out with the lads and
lasses. Before Dave came to College a night
out ruined his promising career as a scout
leader. Dave had taken some young scouts to
Sussex for a camp. Unfortunately Dave failed
in his duty and did not keep the scouts
occupied in the evening by teaching them
camp fire songs etc. Instead he invited some
girls down to the local hostelry. But when the
cat's away The bored scouts occupied
themselves by sending dirty postcards to their
hometown dignatories, who provided a
welcoming party upon the scouts return.
David was promptly drummed out.
Screwing at the Union's
expense
As a chemistry undergraduate. David still
liked a good night out. He only became
interested in F E L I X after being nominated
for the post of Alternative Prospectus editor
while drunk. But as David's interest in
F E L I X grew, so did the stories about his
Rowe-timeless dress sense
sexual antics. Last year their were rumours
that David spent a great deal of time at the
NUS conference drinking, 'smoking' and
screwing at the Union's expence. The other
Union representative, Hugh 'Noddy' Stiles,
had to console himself with a good pork pie .
Superstud
It was probably about this time Dave
developed a reputation for being a superstud.
Regretably the truth is far more boring. One
of Dave's best kept secrets concers a young
lady who was well known in chemistry for
'putting it about'. Whilst under the influence
of alcohol, Dave invited her back to his flat.
Unfortunately by the time she had removed
her stockings Dave had realised his mistake
and instructed the young lady to get into
bed.... while he slept on the floor. He can't
have had much sleep though because his
girlfriend was due to arrive at ten in the
morning!
Milk delivery replaced by
vintage port
David's transformation from vagabond to
true English gentleman occured last summer
with a session of eating in South
Kensington's best,, and most expensive,
restaurants so that he could review them for
the Handbook. Maybe it was the pressure,
but something persuaded Dave that he had
the wrong idea of what a good night out
entailed . Dave attempted to turn the F E L I X
office into a select gentleman's club. The
daily milk delivery was replaced by one of
vintage port. J Martin Taylor, F E L I X
business manager-cum-butler, was instructed
to fetch port, pate and a crisply ironed copy
of 'The Daily Telegraph' from Piccadilly.
Renowned for his caustic
wit, lack of money and
liking of a night out
Perhaps the most marked change in
personality this year has been his
extravagance . Dave was renowned last year
for the way he would search Waitrose high
and low for goods that had passed their sell-
by date. He would then haggle with the
manager to obtain a reduced price. It is
believed that if all the money he owes was
gathered in one place at one time the sudden
movement of such large sums of money
would cause the collapse of the world
banking system.
Dave is planning to progress from F E L I X
to a career in journalism where his ready wit
should serve him well in the news room and
his appreciation of good wine should serve in
El Vino's. If and when Dave leaves the
F E L I X office it will have lost one of its
characters and most talented editors.
