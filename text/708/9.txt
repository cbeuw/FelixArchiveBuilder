The Union organised a
delegation to present our case for
better facilities to the University
Grants Committee on a rare visit
to the College. The U G C said
they were 'impressed by the
student representatives they
met', but said they couldn't do
anything for us. A new effort to
solve the Union's finance
problem was proposed at a
U G M — t h e President would
have to check all the Daily Union
bingo cards sent in to him. So far
nobody has sent him any.
The College was evacuated at
the end of Febuary after a caller
told the switchboard there was a
'bomb in the building'. Most
people were evacuated from
academic buildings, but alarms
in halls were largely ignored due
to the many fake alarms.
The City and Guilds College
Centenary was marked by a
series of events in March. A n
exhibition, Tech 2000, was
opened by the Prime Minister, a
banquet in the Guildhall was
attended by H R H The Duke of
Edinburgh, and many disting-
uished academics addressed a
'Symposium on 21st Century
Technology'. Students were
given three days off lectures and
many treated it as a holiday
although enough were eventually
persuaded to stay and act as
guides for the thousands of
school pupils who visited the
College.
The IC team reached the final of
University Challenge for the first
time, but were defeated by Jesus
College, Oxford. However they
did defeat Somerville, Oxford;
Queens, Belfast; Birmingham
and Edinburgh on the way to the
final.
The setting up of a National
Student Services Organisation
(NSSO) by the N U S at a
conference during the Easter
vacation is likely to be a
continuing story next year. The
conference voted to exclude non-
NUS colleges, and this includes
IC, from the NSSO even though
they are members of the smaller
consortia that the NSSO is
swallowing up. The competance
of the new organisation is also in
doubt.
The Union's financial crisis
came to a head early this term
with hard decisions having to be
taken. Initially U F C decided to
abolish tour grants and cut travel
subsidies for IC clubs in an effort
to reduce the £28,000 shortfall of
next year. Five Year Plans were
also pruned heavily with the most
notable cut being the proposed
new boat for Boat Club,
although Audio and Micro Clubs
also lost their allocations. Tours
were subsequently reinstated
subject to certain criteria.
M r Mooney's retirement at the
end of May was marked with a
special farewell issue of F E L I X .
Whilst many will feel IC is poorer
with the loss of one of its great
characters, few will miss the food
which his sucessor will hopefully
be able to improve. The special
issue featured the highlights of 32
years of F E L I X coverage of M r
Mooney's successes (few) and
failures (many).
The end of the year was
marked with bad news about the
financial position of students
next year. It was already known
that parental contributions
would rise steeply and the
delayed grant announcement
gave the expected 3% rise in the
main rate. Students are likely to
lose their entitlement to Housing
Benefit and Supplementary
Benefit in proposals to be put
forward in a Green Paper due out
soon. A Green Paper already
published has announced the
squeeze on universities with a 2%
cut in real terms each year being
proposed. Also there is to be a
5% rise in Hall rents, decided at a
stormy Student Residence
Committee meeting three weeks
ago. Caught in the middle and
being squeezed from both sides
students are likely to lose out
badly next year.
