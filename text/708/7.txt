The year started on an optimistic
note with news of a possible new
hall of residence on top of the
Sports Centre. Little progress has
been made, however, and the
financial viability of the scheme
is in doubt. Further exciting news
was the proposal of science parks
at Silwood Park and South
Kensington. Again, progress has
been slow, but the plans are still
under way. Also during the
summer a new telephone
exchange was introduced. As an
exercise in causing the maximum
disruption and confusion it went
very well. For several weeks
callers found it almost impossible
to phone in to the College.
The Freshers' issue covered the
major crime at IC this year—an
armed bank raid on the NatWest
sub-branch. A shot was fired and
£26,000 stolen. Also in the news
was the opening of the Union
Snack Bar under the manage-
ment of Norman Jardine. The
first non-Mooney food in College
for many years was an instant hit
with students a n d staff.
Meanwhile M r Mooney's outlets
were continuing true to form
with a spate of incidents where
beef was being sold as lamb.
A story which appeared in
several issues of F E L I X was the

all hours of the day and night
causing much annoyance to
residents. The situation is still not
fully resolved although the

A division of opinion in the
higher ranks of the College
hierarchy was publicly revealed
when Sir Henry Fisher (chairman
of the Governors) made his

criticized remarks the Rector had
make in his speech minutes
earlier in the ceremony
welcoming the broadening of
sixth form studies.
Refectories again hit the
headlines in November when a
motion committing the Union to
organise refectory boycotts if
there were further price increases
was passed at a U G M . Prices
have not gone up since, so there
have not yet been any boycotts,
but the policy remains effective
until a new computerised pricing
system is introduced.
Later in the month the
Government announced that the
minimum grant would be
abolished and some parents
would have to pay tuition fees
from next year. There was a wide-
ranging campaign opposing
these changes, including a N U S
organised (or more accurately,
NUS dis-organised) march which
ended i n c o n f u s i o n a n d
confrontation with the police. In
the end Sir Keith Joseph had to
make an embarassing climb
down in the teeth of opposition
from the middle-class Tory
voters who would be hit by the
move.
Closer to home, the Union ran
into financial difficulties caused
by a shortfall in expected income.
Just before Christmas a 3% cut
was imposed on all clubs and
societies to avoid overshooting
the budget. Troubles of a
different kind also afflicted the
