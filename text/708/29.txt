Writing a sports review has been
a trifle difficult, having had only a
complete set of this year's issues
of FELIX as a source of
information. From these one
gets a rather distorted
impression of sport at IC.
Although several clubs took part
in the prestigous U A U
competitions this year, many of
them chose to document this
only very sporadically. Some of
the larger clubs submitted no
more than two or three match
reports in total, which is really
rather poor.
Sides from only three
clubs—rugby, badmington, and
cricket — got through the
opening rounds of their UAU
competitions. IC rugby 1st X V
secured their position at the top
of their group with a resounding
win over Kent, having already
defeated Surrey and Sussex, but
failed to get any further.
Regrettably, one of the few well
publicised matches was the
annual fixture between the RSM
and Camborne School of Mines,
when the visitors did little to
improve their reputation for bad
behaviour.
Members of the badmington
club did well in the mens'
doubles, ladies' doubles, and
mixed doubles in the individual
UAU competitions, with all three
pairs reaching the quater-final
stage. IC also reached the
regional finals in the ladies team
event, only to be defeated by
Brunei and Bradford. The club
was also one of the few to
publicise its achievements
adequately.
The 1st eleven cricket team
fought their way into the second
round of the UAU earlier this
term with a win over the powerful
Reading. Unfortunately they
were then defeated by Brunei in
the next match. The 2nd eleven
did rather poorly in the
competition, but after losing the
first two matches by a wide
margin they managed to achieve
a measure of respectability when
losing by only six runs to a
Reading side captained by a man
with a grudge against humanity.
Apparently he has piles, the
cricket club has also frequently
fielded a 'Sunday' eleven,
captained by Robin Graham.
This has provided an opportun-
ity for many more people to play
cricket. This year has also seen
the formation of a ladies' eleven.
The football club, it seems,
hardly played a game all year.
Mention must be made of the

fifth's, however, who had to
carry on playing through a series
of depressing results.One game
which must be recorded was the
annual FELIX versus ENTS
fixture. Despite the abscence of
Rowe of the Rovers, the FELIX
side achieved their first ever
victory by the stunning score of
7-1.
Over the past year no club has
contributed more to the FELIX
sports page than the hockey
club. Hardly a week has gone by
without a report of the
adventures of the mens', ladies',
and mixed teams. Unfortunately,
there do not appear ro be any
particularly stunning results to
which to draw further attention.
This also seems to be true of the
snooker club.
For the water polo club, 1984-
85 was a fairly successful year; as
usual they won the ULU cup.
They also took part in the UAU
competition and only just failed
to qualify for the finals in the play-
off at Warwick. IC swimming
club continued to be fairly strong
and again won the U L U
championship.
Two members of the boat club
distinguished themselves this
year by being selected for the
national lightweight squad, and
the club itself had several good
results. Notably, the mens'
novices squad went through the
head season unbeaten, and the
men's top squad achieved a
number of wins at Henley.
Though the cross-country
club had a fairly ordinary season
in terms of results, IC again
hosted the annual Hyde Park
relay. This was the 37th gunning
of the race, and it was won by
Loughborough university for the
fourth time in five years.
1984-85 was not a great
sporting year for IC, though
most clubs are still very well
supported in terms of student
membership. Hopefully this will
continue next year and we will
achieve greater success in more
competitions.
