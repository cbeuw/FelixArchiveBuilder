A racey start leads into the

adventure we know and and
love. 'Soviet Micro-chip'...

fittingly played by the zealous
Grace Jones who manages to
act right up until the last few
scenes. Bla...bla...bla...plans

exciting climax on the top of
Golden Gate Bridge.
It was enjoyable but kept
you waiting for that one new

perhaps? But no despite the
great expense and skillful
production, the film still lacks
that one thing to distinguish it
from the other James Bond
films. It is by no means the
best one yet.
C A B A R E T
Nico's Night
She walks in through the front
door, five minutes after the
doors open, and without
changing from the black
clothes she is wearing, she
gets up on stage and starts to
sing an old, sad song. The
deep, sensual core is still
there, despite the coarse,
aged exterior.
She turned to singing in
clubs and cabarets when the
Velvet Underground left her,
and she still uses the same
wooden organ that she used
to sing with them. It is clear
that her voice is still beautiful,
her head reaching back for
those high notes over the
drum and piano that play
behind her. Another night and
another song, on into those
self-obsessed songs from the
mid-seventies, 'for the rebels
in the audience'.
Everyone was there for what
she was then and not for what
she is now. It would seem
unlikely that many people
have heard those songs she
did since 1969, when the
Warhol, Superstar, Under-
ground gfamour died down.
Its true she cannot write the
best of songs, but she knows
it. There is still something very
special about seeing her, a
cabaret singer really, but
always very worth seeing.

WRITERS'
FESTIVAL
The 1985 Young Writer's
Festival opens at the Royal
Court Theatre on Wednesday,
26 June, with three new
productions and two rehear-
sed readings from contribu-
tions aged between 19 and 14
year old. The plays revolve
around a variety of topics,
family life, holidays by the
seaside and most, if not all,
have children as the central
characters. In addition to the
plays themselves, the Royal
Court are runing two side
events. The Younger Young
Writers Event, on 2 and 3 July,
exhibits work from authors
under 14, and was proposed
as a response to the enormous
interest to the Festival, (over
400 plays were received in all).
In addition, the theatre will
present The Glimpse, a
collection of paintings and
c e r a m i c s c o n t r i b u t e d by
students at the Royal National
College for the Blind.
Last years festival winners,
J a n e A n n i n g and Eileen
Dillon, received exceptionally
high appraisal for their work,
and Anning's play, Unity is
b e i n g p e r f o r m e d at the
Edinburgh Festival in a new
production by Beit Theatre.
This years productions are
Stalemate by Emily Fuller,
Who knew Mckenzie? by
Brian Hilton and Gone by
Elizabeth Krechowiecka. For

2029 is an imported fashion,
art and design magazine. It
appears about four times a
/ear, is of e n o r m o u s
proportions, (600mm x
420mm) and at a purchase
price of £2.00, is arguably the
best value international
portfolio currently available.
A l t h o u g h p u b l i s h e d in
Germany, many of the articles
are in French or English. The
magazine's emphasis is on
stimulating the eye rather
than the mind, and with size as
well as style: extravagant
areas of space, full or double
page blow-ups and expanded
type are all commonly used.
Text is kept to a minimum.
I often question the purpose
of international magazines
such as these. The pages
present numerous images
with captions in often
indecipherable languages, so
that the artists' work is forced
to be self-explanatory,
(which, in general, it isn't, as
'fashionable' art, although
facile, can often rely as much
on clever word-play as it does
on visual impact). To me, such
magazines exist entirely for
their own sake. They are
entirely one dimensional,
displaying one aspect to all:
Style. Style, so often
misunderstood as the ability
to impress, rather than the
desire to maintain standards
of excellence. And where
there's style, there's brass.
Style is for the rich, or for the
handsome poor. Die Einrich-
tung, (furniture manufact-
urers): 'not the useful, but the
moving and exciting will
survive of what man creates'.
Francesco Scavullo, (photo-
grapher): 'I know from the
minute they walk in the studio,
that I will make them better
than they have ever looked in
their lives'.
Moreover, if the emphasis
on style is to impress, then its
appeal is based on deception,
either through seduction or,
preferably, confusion. Never
mind the quality, feel the
width: Hold a foreign book or
magazine in your hands. Leaf
t h r o u g h it. U n a b l e to
understand the text, you
glance at the pictures, study
the cover, look at the content,
the quality, the price. And if
you like it, you buy it, despite
being oblivious to its opinions
or objectives. Opinions,
objectives. Who needs them?
Blinded by style, that's 2029.
Issue 3 of 2029 is available

Gallery,, 5-8, Great Newport
S t r e e t , L o n d o n W C 1 ,
