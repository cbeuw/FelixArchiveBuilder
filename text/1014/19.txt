Rugby LS
IC Virgins vs Royal Holloway & Bedford
IC Virgins arrived at Royal
Holloway's ground raring to
go, after some dubious map
reading which sent us the
wrong way around the M25
(thanks Penny).
An unfortunate first
quarter lead to three soft tries
being scored against us. We
finally got things together and
kept Holloway at bay for the
rest of the half.
Following a rallying half
time talk from the coaches, IC
started the second half in
fighting mood (literally). IC
kept the pressure on Holloway
with some good team play
until the last five minutes,
when we conceded two tries on
the wing.
I Congratulations to
everyone for their brilliant
effort during the game and in
Southside afterwards.

ICvs St. Barts
On Saturday IC travelled to
Bethnal Green to play St.
Barts. Unfortunately there
were no umpires and as our
reserve had mysteriously not
appeared we agreed to play
with 6 players on each side,
with one player from each
team umpiring.
IC made a strong start,
OSS : .r.fj
Barts came back at the
beginning of the 2nd quarter,
but we soon regained our
composure and by the end of
the 3rd quarter we were
aiming for a half century.
However towards the end,
being more than 20 goals
ahead the concentration lapsed
out of our i i «
it was a c
< nsive vie 1
and the gH§e was played in a
friendly spirit.

London vs Best of Rest
The London University
Windsurfing Club (comprising
mostly IC sailors) stole a
dramatic one point victory last
weekend, in the "Brass
Monkey" inter-uni contest -
being held for the first time.
Our racing pedigree was
confirmed by beating the well-
established university clubs of
Oxford, Cambridge,
Southampton, East Anglia and
Essex. The contest was hosted
by Oxford University at the
Farmoor Reservoir where,
despite light winds, the racing
was both highly competitive
and enjoyable. Each round of
the league structure was
carried out with identical
boards and sails.
We now have everything to
prove in next term's student
championships in Clacton.
Blatant space
Arrgh. My-wofSj
has come true: it*s nea
10pm and I've got about riS^L
page to fill up. It's at tones
like this I wish I'd listened to
what my mother used to tell
me. "What did your mother tell
you Mark?" you cry. I don't
know - 1 never listened. Boom
boom! Yes, I'm not above
cracking jokes to fill the page
up.
On a more serious note,
what happened with the
reports this week? Perhaps
with sundown occurring so

our teams have been knocked

something to do*with it. Or
maybe yoxi just like to see me

I'd like to give my thanks
to the foiir teams that did
submit a report this week, it is
especially good to hear from
Windsurfing and Rowing for
the first time (and they won!).
