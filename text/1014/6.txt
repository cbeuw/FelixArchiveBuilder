Clued Up
Quite
Contrary
Now correct me if I'm mistaken,
but I think Pink Floyd were taking
the mick out of those poor
disenfranchised seventies kids in
Another Brick in the Wall. "WE
DON'T NEED NO EDUCATION."
sneered the rebel-stoked brats.
Call me a pedant (I'd prefer 'Big-
boy of my wildest dreams'...) but
that is a double negative. What
was it they were saying about
education?
Sitting on the bus, I was
troubled for a second or two by
the state of schooling and the
Ministry of Education's knee-jerk
solutions. League tables are great
if all you're comparing is boys
kicking leather. Trying to quantify
the quality of education though,
does make me shudder. Just think
back to Dead Poets Society and
the plotting of a poem's merits on
x and y axes.
My muses were interrupted
by the exuberant conversation of
some schoolboys. Oh, alright,
theirs was the only chat my
straining ears could pick up.
"There ain't no point", began one
(and in a distant stadium, some
grey haired old men smiled
knowingly), "in buying just the one
lottery ticket."
What?! Had these children
of the microchip era cracked the
system and was I going to
eavesdrop the secret?
"'Cos the odds of winning
are 14,000,000 to one aren't
they?" Well, 13,983,816 to one to
be precise; no, I said I'd prefer
'Big Boy...'
"So you may as well spend
an extra pound and get 'em down
to 7,000,000 to one."
Oh dear. I didn't have the
heart to shatter their illusions but
has anyone got the number for
HM inspectors?

People moan a lot. I cannot exempt
myself from this by any means, in
fact I would say that complaint and
bitterness are two things at twenty
one that I have actually got to grips
with. My flat-mate was moaning
about the fact that we have no
dishwasher or microwave in our
kitchen, an argument which while
essentially flawless, is totally
meaningless as we are about as
likely to go out and buy mobile
phones as go out and buy a
dishwasher.
This however set me thinking
about my position in life, an
approach often termed as the half
empty glass theory. I look at people
with the view that they want
something, but they haven't asked
for it yet. This, I know, is probably
all paranoid dysfunction, but I
actually do look at things that way.
So when I came to think about the
things that I like, off the top of my
head I couldn't think of any.
There is a Robert Altman film
called Bill Durham, in which Kevin
Costner delivers an insipid little
soliloquy about what he believes
in. "
I believe that one man shot
Kennedy", etc. A banal diatribe
indeed, and one which Altman
wrote on a whim when his original
scene was all wrong; he has
subsequently tried to have it
removed from the film, but of
course, the studio loved it and
americans the world over have
been quoting it to their unnec-
essary friends and womenfolk ever
since it hit a cinema screen. My
point is that people find it difficult
to enthuse about anything without
sounding crass and ironic.
I have attempted to list my
top twenty things, which at great
risk to my own credibility, are by no
means ironic, and an honest
attempt at not being such a
miserable bastard.
