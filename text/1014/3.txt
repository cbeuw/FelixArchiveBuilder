Gates To Close
BY ANDY SINHARAY
Following continued complaints
from 169 Queen's Gate,
pedestrian gates on Imperial
College Road could close at
night.
Although the road was
closed in 1962 it has been a
public right of way between
Queen's Gate and Exhibition
Road. Speaking to F E L I X ,
Nicholas Black, the Estates
Manager, said that residents of
the block of flats directly
opposite the Rector's residence
on Imperial College Road have
reported disturbances and
damage to cars late at night: "I
had a very strong letter of
complaint of the Chair of the
Residents Association about
'badge damage' to cars ...and
general horsing around."
In response, there has been a
suggestion that the gates should
be locked, between 11pm and
6am nightly, for a trial period.
Mr Black added that he had told
the Association that such a
closure would inconvenience
certain students returning from
College and the Union late at
night. For students in Evelyn
Gardens in particular, IC road is
a popular short cut. This, says
Mr Black, has led to allegations
from residents that Imperial
students were almost certainly
causing the damage. He believes
that certain other members of
the public are as likely to be
responsible as students.
Mr Black admitted that he
sympathised with the residents,
and felt that other solutions,
such as cameras or guards, would
be too expensive. 'This is a trade-
off; I've got disgruntled students
versus disgruntled neighbours!'
he said in a statement to Lucy
Chothia, ICU President. T know
where my priorities are, but it is
very difficult to make a case with
an irate, damaged car owner'.
However, he does not think that
it would inconvenience many
students, and has said that he
welcomes alternative sugg-
estions. Also proposed has been
the closure of the Prince Consort
Road gates.
Ms Chothia said that she
had received details of the
suggested closures and had since
replied to the Estates Division.
"This is going to be a big
inconvenience for all
students...[the Estates Division]
don't agree with that," she said.
"There's very little reason for
doing it other than complaints
from the local residents...I'd be
very interested to hear from any
students with stronger views so I
can represent them in college."
News In Brief
BY PAUL DIAS
More Rag Mag Bans
This year's Imperial College Rag
Mag has been banned in a
further four London colleges
since U L U outlawed it last week
(see News, FELIX 1013). The
magazine, which features
bizarrely modified male
genitalia, has now also been
shunned by Goldsmiths Union,
Royal Holloway College Union,
London School of Economics
Union and King's College Union.
In a further Rag Mag-related
development, the London
medical schools St Guy's and St
Thomas's, and St George's have
requested as many copies as they
can get their hands on.
Expeditions Calendar
The first ever calendar produced
by the Imperial College
Explorations Board will go on
sale on Monday. The calendar
features spectacular colour
photographs of a selection of IC
expeditions from around the
globe. The pictures range from
dramatic snow-lined peaks and
slippery pot-holes to a
transparent-winged butterfly and
an 'unidentified fungus'. The
Imperial College Expeditions
Calendar 1995 costs £3.95 and
can be picked up in the Union
Bookstore on the walkway.
No Hockey Fine
The Imperial College Hockey
Club will not be charged £115 for
the tampon-related damage
caused to ceiling tiles in Da
Vinci's bar (see News, F E L I X
1 O 1 3). The Hockey Club
themselves painted over the
brown marks on the tiles, and it
was decided that these repairs
were sufficient, precluding the
need to buy new ones.
Jordan Fanzine Launched
This week saw the launch of a
new American-music fanzine,
produced by Jon Jordan, who is a
virtually permanent fixture in
F E L I X T O W E R S . The
fanzine, called 'And The Living
Is Easy', features interviews with
Pavement, Yo La Tengo and
Lotion, along with reviews of
gigs and albums. Jon says he has
plans to produce four issues a
year, and material for the late
January edition is already
pouring in. Jordan claims his
fanzine is a "bargain at only a
pound!!!", and is available now
in the Union Newsagent on the
walkway.

Funding of Science
Should M r Ashdown be
committed to funding science
and 'blue sky' research? The
obvious answer would be 'yes' -
this is Imperial after all and
besides everyone always answers
yes when asked (inverted
Oliver's) if they want some more.
But wouldn't it be fair to say
that science is, in fact, one of the
most financially backed of all
fields of endeavour? Try getting
extra money for a new art gallery,
music or for the rebuilding of the
British Film industry. It has
become impossible for these
institutions to walk about town
with anything other than a
begging bowl. I suppose that it
could be argued that the National
Lottery has been set up to get the
money to plough back into them,
but doesn't this highlight even
more clearly the arts precarious
and irrelevant position?
Imagine if an MP from the
Department of Trade and
Industry were seriously to
address the House of Commons
as follows: " M y honourable
friend in the Treasury has
informed me that purse strings
must be pulled yet tighter this
year. Therefore we have decided
to cut heavily on our
commitment to research and
development work. Instead, we
shall be introducing an annual
horse-racing event, widely
advertised and hosted by a top
celebrity has-been. The proceeds
will go to the funding of heart,
lung and nuclear weapons
research as well as our top
scientific institutions. Therefore,
I cannot confirm our fiscal
commitment to science this year,
but my good friend Peter Snow
has rigged up an excellent
predictive forecast graph which
you will notice dropping down
from the screen behind Madame
Speaker..."
The truth is that science is
now in the same position as
health, unemployment and law

and order. No party will admit to
it being anything other than a
top priority and yet none of them
are prepared to expend the
massive amount of resources
needed to really change the arena
at all. Whether we have seized
Wilson's 'white heat of
technology' or simply stumbled
again into the realm of Market
Forces I leave for another day...
