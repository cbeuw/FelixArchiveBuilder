Tim B u r t o n ' s the n i g h t m a r e
b e f o r e C h r i s t m a s is a film which
you get the feeling has been a long
time coming. Indeed Burton's
original concept for a stop-motion
animation has grown from the
status of a part-time labour of love
to something approaching a full
length obsession. But thanks to the
success that he has crafted with the
Batman series, Beetlejuice and
Edward Scissorhands, Burton has
been humoured and in return he
has once again proved that his
version of gothic quirkiness can
make money.
The fact that his name has as
much prominence in the title as the
nominal subject seems to suggest
that this film is the closest we have
got to the Burton psyche thus far.
(Of course it could just be a cash-in
opportunity.) To use the Branaghism
of the moment; this is Burton's won
personal monster, and maybe that's
why it's such a peculiar film in both
word and deed.
The action starts in Halloween-
town on the night of Halloween.
Yep, the ghouls are in full throttle
and leading the fiery charge is their
King, Jack Skellington. It's in these
first five or so minutes that the full
glory of the stop-motion method of
animation is displayed. In a similar
way to the opening swooping
camera shots on 'Batman returns',
Burton sells his vision for all it's
worth.
However the longer the film
goes on, the more the mode of
animation becomes a burden
especially when stretched to seventy
minutes. Equally the plot, relying as
it does on the stagehall mode of
imparting information through
songs and the limitations inherent
in the use of puppets rather than
people, doesn't emote. Yes the
concept is very clever and the
animation is excellent but I got the
impression that Burton was doing
exactly what he wanted to do. To
that degree this is a film designed
to cater for b-movie cultists and
technophreaks. The rest of us will
find it interesting, funny in parts,
technically superb but then we'll go
back and cry over Edward
Scissorhands.
In m i r a c l e on 34th s t r e e t ,
one of the first of this season's
festive films, Kriss Kringle (Richard
Affenborough) tries to prove to a
group of non-believers in New York
City that he is the real Santa Claus.
The story revolves around two
rival department stores of which
one employs Kriss as their in-store
Santa. He proves to be so
ridiculously successful that the rival
store attempts to 'blacken the good
name' of Santa. By now the film has
already run on for far too long and
we have yet to even reach the
climatic and farcical court scene.
What needs to be clearly
indicated is that this is a film that is
solely aimed at children and is likely
to be only enjoyed by those under
the age of 10. Anyone above this
age ought to have acquired enough
taste to know when something is far
too nauseatingly sentimental and
melodramatic for its own good. In
particular the child [Mara Wilson,
the brat in 'Mrs. doubtfire') is too
cynical and irritatingly knowledge-
able, and played in such a
sickeningly cute manner with such a
complete lack of ability that even
Santa wouldn't touch her with a
barge-pole (metaphorically speak-
ing).
As with all films of this kind it is
completely predictable and given
the film's length, it soon gets
boring. In fact the film is exactly the
sort of slush you expect John
Hughes to churn out ie. high on
cuteness and kids, low on plot
development, scripting and
appalling stereotypical adult
characterisations. In fact it's hard to
find anything positive to say about
the film, except maybe that it will
teach Attenborough to stay behind
the camera considering the disaster
which was his accent in 'Jurassic
Park'.
In short, this is just another
standardised Hollywood 'feel-good'
movie for the Christmas period
which is just as dull, predictable and
unfunny as the rest. The blurb says
"discover the miracle" but the only
miracle you'll discover is the strange
and sudden reduction of cash from
your pocket.
For once there'll be no
beating around this one, trial by
jury is a rank film which by the end
has become plain nasty in tone.
Joanne Whalley-Kilmer takes
the millstone of playing Valerie, a
single mother who does jury service
on a godfather murder trial because
she believes in duty, paying taxes,
the american way and apple pie for
dinner. Of course the mobster
decides to put pressure on her by
threatening her young son, and her
dear ol' dad. Too frightened to go
to the police Valerie decides to
hang the jury so the mobster,
hilariously called Rusty, goes free,
even though in the meantime he
has managed to rape her.
What more could happen
scream a frantically spelled bound
audience? Now that Valerie has
endured all this she can easily avoid
being killed by the mobster's
doublecross before wandering out
to his secret hide out, where she
shows him some leg and sticks an
ice pick in his neck. It's a film bad
enough to make you wish for
'Natural born killers'. Well almost©
no roar
Quantity is a poor substitute for
quality in food. At £4.50 for lunch,
the Paper Tiger provides superb
quantity for money, with a ten-
course Chinese buffet allowing
you to eat as much as you want.
But how much will you want to eat?
The clear vegetable broth is
probably the best dish on offer. It
is hot and digestible but lacks
flavour, with only a few vegetables
swimming in the tureen.
Grease came next, served
with spring rolls and chicken
wings. The spring rolls were hot
and crispy but totally lacking in
filling and saturated in cooking oil.
The chicken wings would have
been more at home in Kentucky
Fried Chicken, having a strange
oriental/american coating.
With soup and starter over
and a gallon of water to clean our
palates, the stainless steel
containers holding the main
courses beckoned. Rice and
noodles sat overcooked and
stodgy waiting to meet their
accompaniments. With a choice of
four main dishes, three containing
meat, the options for vegetarians
were limited - an uninspiring
combination of stir-fried
vegetables, which had turned into
stir-stewed vegetables as they sat
in the container. The beef in black
bean sauce, sweet and sour pork
and chicken curry fared no better
under the pressures of the buffet
table.
Stir-fried dishes are meant to
be cooked quickly, served quickly
and eaten quickly, not left in a pot
to survive a whole lunchtime. The
courses were brimming with the
flavouring enhancer M S G , but
there was very little flavour to
enhance. The meat and
vegetables were overcooked; the
sauces were glutinous, clinging to
the mouth because of heavy-
handed cornflour use. The latter a
desperate attempt to add body to
the emaciated flavours.
And that was the end of the
ten courses as advertised on the
board outside. With rice, noodles
and wanton considered courses in
their own right, the evidence of
value for money suddenly became
less convincing.
The food at the Paper Tiger is
at best comparable to a dodgy
Chinese takeaway. If you are in
that kind of mood and are very
hungry, then it's worth a visit. But
as value for money goes, there are
far better offers available. ©
