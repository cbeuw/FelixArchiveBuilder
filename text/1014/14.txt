Roll out the carpets, ladies and gents for rotation. This week
proudly presented by Ewok.
Once more to the breach dear friends. Follow Patrick Wood
and his amazing reproductive style down to the Science
Museum and the exhibition Centuryscape.
There are strange goings on at the Courtyard Theatre.
Reports of the Nosferatu abound. George got the low down.
More scary events occur in Tim Burton's the Nightmare
before Christmas - tintin sees the action. C. A. Berry, J. Ho
and K. Hopkins grind their collective teeth over the remake of
Miracle on 34th Street and tintin gets in on the ads with
Trial by Jury.
For the second time this year the Paper Tiger gets a visit
from the IC lunching critics. This time there's no falling down
steps but AC has to chew hard.
Patrick Wood gets all laudatory over the ENO's production of
Khovanshchina.
Woodstock or Woodenstock? is the question posed by Vik,
whilst He/en-Louise does (the Best of) New Order and James
gets to give Sarah McLachlan a good panning.
It's not bad.

Sounds like Bill Cosby singing to

To get to the Science Museum's
Centuryscape exhibition you first
have to tear yourself away from the
pinball machine in the foyer fertility
display (thudoinggg... 'Congrat-
ulations, you are pregnant'). In a
small room up on the second floor
a collection of paintings and
drawings on the theme of 'art,
science and industrial landscape'
seems to jostle for wall space. The
works span a century, from a
painting of the Manchester Ship
Canal dated 1 894, to a view of
Albertopolis from the Queen's
Tower executed earlier this year.
The tone of the exhibition is fairly
optimistic, although a couple of
grim pictures stand out; a large,
nightmarish charcoal drawing of a
railway bridge by Hans Baluschek,
'Ways of the Machine'; and George
Clausen's excellent 'Coal' from
1924.
There are several paintings
commissioned for adverts by the
regional railways, and a busy
picture of Clapham Junction by
Terence Cuneo. "Since 1953,
Cuneo has bidden a mouse in most
of his paintings," announces the
label provocatively.
The exhibition finishes with
several rather bland pictures by
official Channel Tunnel artist
Tabitha Salmon, and a very heavy-
handed allegory by Sir Roy Calne
FRS. Calne is a surgeon, and his
semi-abstract watercolour studies,
made as a guide for a recent
multivisceral transplant, are more
interesting. Runs until 29th Jan.
NB: To avoid alarming any of our
readers, the editor has asked me to p
out that, despite the fact that Lorenz
Pelegrini sh*gs one in 'Foucauifs Pen
ulum', you cannot get pregnant fro
pinball machine. Q
return of the suckers
This play, Nosferatu - a symphony
of terror, is based on J. W.
Murnan's classic 1922 film, which
was one of the first adaptations of
'Dracula' by Bram Stoker.
Although it refers to well
known and much used material this
version is different from what
you've seen up to now on the
subject of vampires and everything
that comes with them.
It is an expressionistic produc-
tion that blends light humour with
endlessly exciting inventiveness and
melodrama. The actors are trans-
formed from people to a stage
coach and also a haunted ship, all
within the atmospheric stage of the
Courtyard Theatre.
And what's more the play
doesn't end with a stake through
the vampire's heart. It seems that
Nosferatu's bite turns the heroes of
the play info sensual 'human'
beings that enjoy their life
afterwards more than the sweet,
cute existence they had before their
adventure. ©
