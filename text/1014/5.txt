OSC Errata
Dear Owain,
FELIX No 1013 pp.9 article on
Welfare Week:
Two mistakes have been made
in the OSC entry.
1. My name is Andreas Mershin
NOT Mershim
2. My e-mail is:
'Mershin@Labvax.ph.ic.ac.uk' not
habvax
Could you please write a
correction in next FELIX as people
might want to contact me and it
will be impossible if they have the
wrong name and address.
Just to make it totally clear:
ANDREAS MERSHIN

Over to STOIC
for the latest...
Dear Sir,
I write to update Lynn's report
(Felix 1013) concerning our
accident at last friday's UGM. Sam
has received our sincerest
apologies and, we are happy to
hear, has almost recovered. I'd
like to point out that the tripod fell
from the permanent lighting tower
in the union lounge, and not
something we'd rigged for the
occasion.
Hopefully this particular STOIC
drama will not be repeated.

Proper Protest
Dear Felix,
I felt that I must respond to Phil
Ramsden's letter (25th Nov). I too
was unsure about the sincerity of
Marcus Alexanders comments (18th
Nov). My first thoughts were that
he did have his "tongue placed
firmly in his cheek". However after
reading the letter and comments
through a few times I decided that
he was sincere, although I was not
quite sure about the "round of
applause for special Branch" part.
Please put the record straight Mr
Alexander.
The point about the
criminalisation of "Peaceful
Demonstration" is interesting. If Mr
Ramsden had any grip on reality he
would know that a member of
demonstrations are far from
peaceful. Is it any wonder that the
government seem to criminalise
demonstration after the anti
Criminal Justice Bill demonstration
fiasco some weeks ago? (of which
the editor was a part) The fact is
that most people in Britain are law
abiding citizens who do have
respect for authority and I reject
the idea that my previous letter
was a 'piece of self abasing
authority worship' - I have always
made up my own mind on such
matters and I do not blindly follow
authority. Has it not occurred to
either Mr Ramsden or the editor
that as people grow increasingly
tired of these demonstrations, then
the causes for which they stand
become more and more opposed
by the population and those who
govern. A demonstration is no way
to gain public support. There are
ways and means of protesting
about problem in a proper manner
and I believe that they are far more
likely to have an effect than
marching through the streets of
London. Marcus Alexander is
correct when he says that we must
work with the system if things are
to change. I would be the first to
admit that Britain is far from
perfect, but I wonder how many
times the protesters have written to
M.P.s or have been to lobby them
at Parliament. You do not have to
buy a suit.
I
t may also be worth considering
that not all people in Britain are
long haired middle class students.

Firstly, thanks for carrying the torch
Richard - we'll make the letters
page a place of debate yet! Luckily,
to this end I still disagree with the
thrust of your argument...
I think discussion about whether
it is useful to one's cause demon-
strate in a public place is a red
herring. A personal decision, it
should have been left as such. The
question is should a mass statement
in the form of a protest be made
illegal? Again, the argument about
the perceived violent inclinations of
protest members is irrelevant. We
have adequate laws dealing with
violence, public disorder, theft and
vandalism and those laws should be
applied to each particular case
rather than something be banned
for the supposed reason that such
activities may stem from it. A wide
variety of activities may lead to
these crimes - football matches,
carnivals and bank transactions for
example, but for the sake of society
and common sense they are not
banned outright.
The real strength in protest is
that it is solidifies ones feeling of
involvement. To our generation, the
disenfranchised nature of politics is
acute. Since early childhood one
party has governed and this lack of
change has, I would argue, been to
the detriment of those of all political
persuasions. A democracy includes
election to sidestep revolution - a
strongly politicised public is equally
important to avoid radicals gaining

power. / would argue that the
audacity of moves like the CJB
directly highlights a dangerous
apathy amongst the populace.
Perhaps I have misread your
letter but your comment concerning
my membership of the recent CJB
'fiasco', coming as it does after a
disparaging remark about the
nature of those who attend such
demonstrations seemed an attempt
to highlight the undeniable and all
too clear flaws in my character...
For the record I obviously feel that
your opinion of those who attend
demonstrations is misguided and I
am happy to reiterate that I have
attended several. I will continue to
do so, as far as the law permits me,
for (I am trying not to be
patronising) your sake as much as
my own...
