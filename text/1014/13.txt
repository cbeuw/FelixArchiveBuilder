just an attempt to annoy any establishments
that have banned us by sneaking in and sell-
ing Rag Mags anyway.
Also coming up, we have an end of term
Christmas carol-singing Pub Crawl, so watch
this space for more details. If you would like
to join this mini tour then sign up at the Rag
meeting today at lpm in the Union Lounge,
or see one of us in the Rag Office.
As a final note Rag would like to thank
all the people who helped to make Rag Week
such a huge success including those who
came along and took part. The people
involved are too numerous to name but we
would especially like to thank Karen for the
Beer Festival, Lewis for the Rag Bash, the IC
Dance Club, the Bands, the CCUs for their
events , all the Union Staff and the
Sabbaticals.
Who: Welsh Soc
What: is the Welsh Society?
Keys: Soirees, Folk, Football
As they say in Cardiganshire - Shwmae
byti, shwt mae'n ceibo? (Aw'right mate,
how's it going?) The Welsh Society is for
anyone who has an interest in learning more
about Wales and in meeting Welsh people.
So far this year we have had several social
events including a cheese and wine, pub
crawls, soirees with The London Welsh Club
and a reporter at the Wales vs Italy rugby
match. (Wales beat Italy by the way, for all
those Italians who thought that Wales was
just a great footballing nation!). We also went
to see Dafydd Iwan and his band play in
Gray's Inn Road - probably the most famous
Welsh singer of all time. It was a chance to
practice our vocal chords (no stereotyping
please!) and to have a couple of Felinfoel
Double Dragons. The party then moved on
to The Mean Fiddler until the early hours.
Our next event will be a cultural visit to
Cardiff. Choose between the Welsh Folk
Museum (if the weather's fine), the Welsh
National Museum, Cardiff Castle or if that
doesn't grab you, the shops and pubs aren't
bad either. We will leave early on the morn-
ing of Saturday 10th November and come
back in the late evening. Interested? - contact
Nefyn Jones (x46612, n.jones@ic) or Rhodri
Moseley (x45042, r.moseley@ic) soon. Likely
cost - about 12 pounds (transport only). We
occasionally go and see the world famous
London Welsh Rugby Club play at home in
Richmond and are planning a weekend in
Aberystwyth and Devil's Bridge next term.
We also meet on the last Friday of every
month at 6.30 in Southside before going on...
Get in touch to get on the mailing list.
We are the only student organisation in
Britain that allows you to obtain any job you
want anywhere in the USA and then be able
to explore North America at your will with
the money that you've earned.
So why spend a predictable summer at
home when you have the chance to experi-
ence a whole new culture and see so many
new things. You won't be alone either as
thousands of students from all over Britain
annually go though Bunac to the USA for
summer and come back having had the time
of their lives. It proves to be a valuable expe-
rience - something that you can always recall
fondly. You can choose to work in
Manhattan, New York, Florida, on a ranch in
Texas, at a children's camp - in fact whatever
takes your fancy. We also have working and
travelling adventures in Canada, Australia
and Jamaica for those interested.
So come and see us at our stand in the
JCR, every Thursday lunch time from 12pm
to 2pm and find out more. Membership is Â£4
and is definitely worth it.
