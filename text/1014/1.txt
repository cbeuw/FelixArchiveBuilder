Beit
Brawl
BY ANDREW SMITH
Following allegations that one of
Imperial College's Security
Officers was drinking on the job,
four Imperial College Union
(ICU) stewards are recovering
after hospital treatment. Their
wounds range from whiplash to
head injuries requiring stitches.
The incident originated in
the theft of a jacket and wallet
belonging to Neil Stewart, a
postdoctoral researcher,
following which both the police
and college security were
informed. Three males,
suspected by onlookers of being
involved in the offense, were
seen in the Beit Quad, after the
Union building had been
cleared.
Following their drunken
behaviour being noticed by the
stewards, it has been claimed
that a college technician accused
the three males of the theft. It
appears that they subsequently
attacked him.
This resulted in the Union
stewards, all six of whom were in
the Quad at the time, attempting
to break up the fight and it was
then that they received their
injuries. Following the attack on
Fiona Grandison, from which
she suffered whiplash, one
steward suffered a broken bone
in his hand while attempting to
subdue the assailants.

Ashdown a Technophile
BY MICHAEL L U D L A M
Paddy Ashdown, Leader of the
Liberal Democrats, gave the
annual Save British Science
lecture last Thursday. To the
meeting in Imperial College's
Great Hall, M r Ashdown
reaffirmed his commitment to
the funding of education and
research. In his speech he said
that financing education was the
Liberal Democrat's first priority;
but when questioned later he
admitted that the party's main
emphasis is still constitutional
change.
Paddy Ashdown mainly
spoke of the need to link
industry and education so that
Britain could compete in world
markets. However, he also felt

that Universities should not,
"spend their time doing 'useful'
short-term applied research for
industry". He said this ought to
be industry's responsibility, so
that academic institutions could
concentrate on what he
described as, "'blue-sky'
research, which provides new
ideas for tomorrow". He spoke of
copying the German system
where the Government
contributes to the salaries of
scientists in small firms for up to
five years.
He was also asked his views
on student finance, and in
particular on graduate tax.
Proposals being considered by
the Liberal Democrats could
mean that graduates would pay a
higher rate of income tax after
their degrees were completed.
Mr Ashdown said that it was
impractical to give grants to all
students at 1979 levels as this
would cost over £7 billion.
In what seemed an attempt
to impress his audience with his
science credentials the leader of
the Liberal Democrats described
himself as a 'complete tech-
nology freak!' who enjoyed
playing around on the Internet.
"The wonderful quality of the
Internet is that it is completely
out of control," he continued.
Recognising the need to
prepare students for college and
University, he noted that
scientists often find themselves
"locked into a narrow career
path" by doing only one type of
subject. To counterbalance this,
he said that the Liberal
Democrats would like to broaden
A-levels into something more
like the International
Baccalaureate. This would
compel those who concentrate on
the arts to broaden their
horizons as it would have a
compulsory maths and science
element.
