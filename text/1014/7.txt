On November 3rd 1983, an
American computing student
called Fred Cohen envisaged
and wrote the world's first self-
replicating computer program. The program
gained him the highest level of access to the
university computer within minutes and,
earned itself the notoriety of being thew^
original computer virus.
Since then, viruses have swept the Wired
world like a plague. In 1986 two software
salesmen wrote the data-destroying Brain
virus, believed to have infected over 100,000
machines. In 1988 a 21-year-old student
released a self-replicating program onto the
Internet. As it copied itself wildly, it shut
down thousands of machines and sent thej
network thrashing. The program passed into
hacker folklore as The Internet Worm.
Fred Cohen believed that the program he
wrote was alive. Stephen Hawking, along with
many H°Llfe scientists, agrees that
computer viruses fulfil all the criteria of
biological life.
simple rules give rise to complex, lifelike
behaviour.
The phenomenon of useful unprogrammed
actions arising from a small set of programmed
rules is known as emergent behaviour.[
Rodney Brooks, Genghis' creator, is
convinced that there are no forseeable
obstacles to the development of robots of human
level intelligence through the action of
emergent behaviour. ^^____^^j~-^J^^e<ti
