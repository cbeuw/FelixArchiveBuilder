Fracas In Library
BY DAVE COHEN
Violence erupted in the
Department of Mathematics
Library, last Thursday after two
students became involved in a
brawl.
Just after 12:30pm, on
Thursday 24th November, Bilal
Al-ali, a Mathematics
Postgraduate, was sitting in the
library working when he was
approached by Seye Ontiri, an
ex-Imperial student now
studying at Southbank
University. After a short scuffle a
fight broke out between the two
men, during which Mr Al-ali
suffered a cut to the brow. Ayse
Santliturk, Assistant Librarian,
called College security who soon
broke up the fight. "I didn't
know [Mr Al-ali] until that day,
he was just a quiet, normal
student," said Mrs Santliturk.
Witnesses said that despite an
attempt by Mr Al-ali to move the
fight outside the library, M r
Ontiri seemed resolute in
settling the matter immediately.
Adrian Clark, Librarian, said:
"Obviously [Ontiri] didn't care
that it could be in a public
place."
Although the motives
behind the fight are unclear at
present, College security have
informed F E L I X that the
matter has been referred to the
Southbank University auth-
orities and investigations are in
progress. Staff in the
Mathematics Department said
that the matter was being taken
very seriously in light of the
letter by Mr Ontiri, published in
last week's F E L I X . The letter
was written, in defense of the
Wing Chun Kung Fu club, as a
reply to a previous anonymous
letter ( F E L I X 1 O 1 O) which
criticised the claims and motives
of the club, as had been outlined
in recent advertisements in
FELIX.
Fees Freeze
BY RACHEL WALTERS
Gillian Shephard, the Education
Secretary, disclosed in her
budget statement on Tuesday
that the level of tuition fees will
be frozen this year.
In a statement that
confirmed the Government's
commitment to replacing
student grants with loans, Mrs
Shephard also announced that
there will be a freeze on
university places for at least the
next three years. The planned
student numbers have been
reduced by 2,000 for 1995-96 and
by 7,000 for 1996-97 compared
with the figures announced in
last year's budget. Grants will be
reduced by 8% next year, further
to this year's 10% cut. The
maximum student loan will rise
accordingly.
Other measures being
introduced by the Department of
Education include reductions in
grants for mature students who
have no dependants. In addition,
students who study in London
and live away from home, but
who could conveniently live with
their parents while at college will
be faced with smaller loans. The
exact figures for these measures
have yet to be announced.
Overall funding for the
Department of Education rose by
1% in real terms. "In a unified
budget which has demonstrated
the Government's determination
to maintain strict control over
public expenditure, we have once
again given priority to
education," said Mrs Shephard.
In reply, David Blunkett,
the Shadow Education Secretary,
said that the budget had "failed
schools and colleges and is bad
news for pupils and students".
He described the operation of
the Student Loan Company as
'completely shambolic' and
called for a review of the whole
system of student support. "In
the meantime," he said.
"Students face increasing
hardship with inadequate and
ineffective arrangements for
maintenance."

Today sees the culmination of Imperial College's Welfare Week, writes Pau
Dias, which was chosen to coincide with yesterday's World Aids Day. The
week featured a host of exciting events and informative stalls, including
IC Day Nursery stall pictured above.

Following a review of Friday
nights proceedings, Showsec
International, the company
whose employees were used at
the beginning of the term, will
once again be in evidence at
Union events. Lucy Chothia,
ICU President, has defended
these measures, saying that they
are necessary since three of the
injured stewards will not be
available to work for some time.
Criticism of college security
centres on questions over one
officer's state at the time of the
incident, and continuing
uncertainty over how many
officers were in the Quad at the
time. Terry Briley, Deputy Head
of Security, insisted that two
officers were on duty that
evening. However, this has
confused many of those present,
who claim that only one officer
was seen. Mr Briley appeared
shocked upon hearing
allegations of drinking by one of
his officers, and emphasised that
he had not received any
complaints of this nature.
With confusion also
surrounding whether college
security called the police when
requested by the Union stewards,
the lack of involvement by
security officers during the
melee has been criticised. Whilst
Mr Briley insists that his officers
attended the injured, the reasons
why they were not further
involved at the time of the
assault has not yet been fully
explained.
If the police were contacted,
as Mr Briley insists, soon after
the violence started, then it is the
police whose actions warrant
questioning. They did not appear
until around 3am, after the three
assailants had finally left Prince
Consort Road. If the lack of
police presence was due to their
slow reaction, then college
security cannot face any
criticism in this respect.
As part of the ongoing
security review, the one camera
which is directed at the entrance
to the Union building is being
deemed inadequate for security
purposes. College Security has
agreed with ICU that this will be
recorded, unlike at present, and
that further cameras, possibly
infra red, will be erected in the
Quad. When these alterations
will take place has not been
decided, though Lucy Chothia
hopes that it will be fitted in the
near future.
Following strong suspicion
that one of the three persons
involved is a first year Civil
Engineer, two of the Union
stewards have been studying
student photographs. This has
not yielded any results so far,
and M r Briley, obviously
committed to finding the
culprits, has appealed to students
with any information to come
forward. He emphasised that full
confidentiality would be
preserved.
