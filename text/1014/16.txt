a motherland's stature
The English Nation Opera's
production of Khovanshchina is
the hit the new management have
been looking for since their
appointment more than a year
ago. Mussorgsky's epic 'The
Khovansky Affair' is a loose
translation set in the turbulent
reign of Peter the Great. The Tsar
himself never appears, due to a
law in force at the time of writing
which forbade the depiction on
stage of members of the Romanov
dynasty. The characters are a
mixture of reactionary religious
zealots, Westernised reformers and
megalomaniac aristocrats. There's
a lot of lamenting the fate of
Mother Russia and at the end
everyone is worse off.
Prince Ivan Khovansky (Willard
White) towers head and shoulders
above a fine cast. Act III, the
strongest both musically and in
Francesco Zambello's imaginative
production, begins with him
stripped to his jockstrap in a
swimming pool. This might not
have worked with an artist of
lesser stature, but here it
completes a portrait of a noble
leader undone by his own vanity.
Earlier, Khovansky's Act I entry
provides the first memorable
moment of the evening when
Alison Chitty's stage set of
movable gantries splits open to
reveal White surrounded by
rearing metal horses and swirling
black flags.
The dark colours of
Shostakovich's orchestration
(Mussorgsky's score was left
unfinished) don't always captivate
the ear as they do on Abbado's
awesome DG recording. But this is
probably more a tribute to what is
happening on stage than a
criticism of music director Sian
Edwards. The final scene is in all
respects the stunning culmination
that it should be. ©

So Woodstock II was a celebration
of music and an attempt to
recreate a supposedly loving and
peaceful atmosphere within the
confines of the money-obsessed
'90s, eh? Yeah, right. If you
believe that then you should stop
reading right now because your
winning lottery number has just
come through...
No, Woodstock II was about
money, from its well-publicised
mythical intentions through to
Woodstock '94, "the single most
extensive and technologically
advanced live event of all time". In
other words it was as decadent as
they come.
Maybe there could be some
kind of exoneration if the music
was any good but if this is the past
and the future together then I'm
glad I live in the now.
So what do you get for your
twenty quid (which of course will
be going straight into the
anthropological, peace-lovin'
claws of the record company
executives)? Well, there's the very
f FELIX 02DGC94
good (Live with the aptly-titled,
'Selling the Drama'), the extremely
bad (Nine Inch Nails, Candlebox,
Salt-N-Pepa), and the downright
ugly (The Neville Brothers
murdering 'Come Together',
Metallica, Joe Cocker).
Interspersed between these
'highlights' we are 'treated' to
some competent but ultimately
uninspiring numbers courtesy of
Green Day, the Cranberries, Red
Hot Chili Peppers, Rollins Band
and the like.
And don't forget those token
gestures - Bob Dylan, Traffic and
Peter Gabriel - supposedly trying
to bring some old-timers' nostalgic
credibility to the proceedings and
instead just sound as flaccid and
limp as many of their physical
parts undoubtedly are.
And there you have it. (Or if
you're sensible you don't have it.)
In answer to the question,
Woodstock or Woodenstock? I
think Crud-Stock would be much
more appropriate. Roll on 2019... I
don't think. (3)
Most readers of this page
know what New Order sound like
- synthesised stuff sung by a bloke
with a melancholic voice. However
I would imagine most of you
couldn't name any of their songs
except 'Blue monday' or 'True
faith'. This is therefore a greatest
hits album full of songs which
weren't hits - or were too long ago
for baby first years like me to
remember. Obviously the album is
long overdue.
I found this very hard to
review. The vinyl copy I was given
(thanks to Charles for letting me
borrow his record player) was a
double album. You could say I'd
be happy with just one of the discs.
Half the songs (the hits) are
brilliant and would get a (10) from
me, an example being 'World in
motion'. The other half, the more
moody, low tempo stuff I just
found boring and rated it only (5).
New Order are the sort of
band who have been around long
enough to be an institution, but at
the end of the day all they'll be
remembered for is the n different
remixes of 'Blue monday'. (7)
Following in the footsteps of
several other singer-songwriters
comes Sarah McLachlan with her
new album, fumbling towards
ecstasy. The work consists of
thirteen all-too-similar ballads, all
centred around Sarah and her
piano.
The style is similar to the likes
of Tori Amos and Annie Lennox,
and in some cases reminiscent of
the Cranberries. Unfortunately
though the music lacks the
conviction of these contemp-
oraries and you end up feeling
cheated having been tempted with
hints of what might have been.
The lyrics are introspective,
and mostly examine relationships
and self-worth. They are dull, and
sink to all time low in the abysmal
"your love is better than ice
cream".
I was unable to listen to this
album all the way through, despite
several attempts. It really is quite
terrible. All the emotion becomes
lost in a sea of banality, and it
ended up just boring me sh*tless.
Go buy something decent instead
like the new Manic Street
Preachers' album. (1) ©
