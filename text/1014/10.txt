^ . or richer, for poorer. For better or for
worse, in sickness and in health. T i l l
death do us part..." These arc the
words which usually accompany one of the
biggest decisions in a person's life. For most
undergraduates at Imperial, it's a choice that
still seems a long way off. But look carefully,
and you may find a few who have already tied
the knot for potentially a lifetime.
So who are these
brave, and quite possibly
foolish, souls? A n d just
why did they do it? Well,
it seems for all the right
and proper reasons. Girl
meets boy, girl and boy
fall in love, girl marries
boy. But do boy and girl
live happily ever after?
Perhaps. But this is
the real world, and there's
no fairy godmother who,
with the wave of a wand,
can sort out all people's
ills. U n i v e r s i t y life,

desk, stationary and books to study. A balance
must be struck and maintained.
Such a state of affairs can lead to
tension between the partners. One student
advised that this point should be rammed
home between the couple before one or both
embarked on a course; that the student will
need to spend time out of college, continuing
study in a quiet atmosphere at home; and that
there w i l l often be
times when they
cannot help wash the
dog, the baby, or each
other.
More advice was
forthcoming. F o r a
start, young children
are only bundles of joy
when they're not
crying their heads off
for no reason at a l l ,
food, or the latest GI
Barbie doll (like
Action Man, but PC).
Forget about a child
while studying unless
you like being woken
up at 4am regularly,
and don't mind occas-
ionally handing in
coursework that's
been chewed by baby
teeth. College facilities
for children were also
found lacking by one
mother, with only the
daycare centre available.
As to whether you should get married at
all as an undergrad in your twenties, the
advice was mixed. In fact, it was yes, maybe
and no, which tells us that love is a confusing
animal if nothing else. The yes camp seemed
to be the romantics. The cautious maybes said
that it was fine as long as both parties knew
exactly what they were letting themselves in
for. T h e no camp were the realists, who
argued that dd wait: people are still
growing and developing, quite possibly in
different directions. By the time you graduate,
your partner may have become someone you
just can't get on with.
I'IV It's not my place to
say; I have no experience in the matter. But
pushed for an opinion, I would say something
that puts me in both the romantic and the
realist camps: true love knows no boundaries,
pot even time.,'fji
