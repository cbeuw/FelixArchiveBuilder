Dear S i r ,
Have you any hope of a bear, a g i r l , and night out?
Do you hope to pass a l l your exams., get a good job, high
pay, house, family, and oar? Have you any hope f o r the
things you really want?
But are these the things we really want? Do we not
seek happiness and a worthwhile l i f e ; the others are
secondary. What then doe3 make suon a l i f e ? Not money
nor pleasures. Psychology has no simple answer and nor
has Christianity but i t oan and does often make great
changes i n peoples lives and hopes.
In America this summer many Christians w i l l be dis-
cussing "The hope of the world" at the great Yforld Counoil
of Churches' Assembly. Early next term many of these men
and women w i l l be i n England speaking to students up and
dowrr the country. KXAtf THAN (cho tarn) who w i l l speak
at this College on Oot. 12 and 15 worked at Rangoon Uni-
versity and i s much concerned with r a c i a l and international
problems. Max Vfarren, a l i v e l y reasonable man, w i l l
also be here and w i l l speak on Oot. 14. These speakers
are important men and should be interesting.

As usual, Guild's A.G.M. saw room 17 and i t s
approaches well f i l l e d with loyal Guildsmcn nearly a l l of
whom were only partly dressed ( i n anticipation of l i v e l y
a c t i v i t i e s afterwanls)
The Presedent told the meeting of the lack of
enthusiasm 3hown by the Police to Field Cup Race. The
following motion was then put :- " That the A.G.M. of
Juilds be held i n Hyde Park". The more serious eleaent of
those present at the meeting foresaw the p o s s i b i l i t y of
the general public voting i n the elections and the motion
was f&mmended .„ "Kxcept for the elections, the A.G.M. of
Guilds be held i n Hyde Park". The motion v/as carried.
'Andy'Levins was elected Presedent for next
session.
Following the usual speeche«(frequently
interrupted by remarks - some witty, 3orae just crude)
the following were elected :-
Vice-President 'Kim' Ash
lion. Sec. Tony Grantham
I.C.Rep. Ron George
As the speeches progressed the only l&dy'Guildanan'
beoamc 'lady', then 'Miss Dent' and f i n a l l y 'Katherine' -
what familiarity'
The remainder af the meeting was conducted i n
Hyde Park vdth a much depleted gathering. The minutes were
read and approved after which Mr. 'Day* pro->o3ed that the
'minutes' be afterw.i-ds called 'seconds' - H" was not
*3"Cond<xl'.
A new item of regalia for the office of Vice-
President was approved - a 'said* bmsh.'

fine account of the years Im^p^nin^s.
Dear S i r ,
In your l a s t i s s u e you p u b l i s h e d a l e t -
t e r a d v o c a t i n g that aoademlo gowns should" be
woi-n at I.C. One of the reasons advanoed i n f a -
vour of t h i s s u g g e s t i o n was t h a t gowns are "the
c e n t u r i e s - o l d trade-mark of s o h o l a r s and s t u -
d e n t s " . S u r e l y t h i s i s the v e r y r e a s o n why
gowns should NOT be worn. What i s the use ef"
i n t r o d u c i n g a f a l s e i m p r e s s i o n of s o h o l a r l l n e a a
amongst those a t t e n d i n g a t e c h n o l o g i c a l cram-
ming shop?
I t i s w i d e l y b e l i e v e d by s t u d e n t s t h a t
l a r g e sums of money are t o be spent, and a r e
b e i n g spent a l r e a d y , on e n l a r g i n g the f a o i l l t l e a
f o r t r a i n i n g s o - o a l l e d " t e c h n o l o g i s t s " ( w i t n e s s
the a c t i v i t y on the r o o f s of the R.3.M. and
G u i l d s ; and around Chem. Tech; and the new Ad-
min, b u i l d i n g i n Queens Gate) but how muoh i a
t o be spent i n r e c t i f y i n g the d e p l o r a b l e l a c k
of r e s i d e n t i a l accomodation f o r students?
We are t o l d t h a t two or t h r e e y e a r a
spent a t c o l l e g e g i v e s one a b r o a d e r view of
l i f e . A b r o a d e r view of l a b . r e p o r t s , and tea*
tubes, and suburban t r a i n s perhaps, but t h e r e
should be more t o l i f e than t h i s . I t seena t o
me that, the present p o l l o y of I.C. i s t o t r a i n <
s u i t a b l e y o u t h t e c h n i c a l l y w h i l e i g n o r i n g t h a

I b e l i e v e t h a t t h e r e i s more t o l i f e
t h a n s q u i n t i n g down some super-microscope or
s i t t i n g at the c o n t r o l p a n e l a f a high-speed

be l e a r n t about l i f e by d i s c u s s i o n w i t h o t h e r s .
Men who w i l l be of most use t o the community
tomorrow are those who know how t o l i v e , n e t
those who know only how t o t w i d d l e the c e n t r e !
knob of some maohine. I t i s s a i d of aen whe ga
t o the U n i v e r a i t y t h a t " i t doesn't matter what
you read at c o l l e g e , so long as you ga t a e e l *

I.C. Expansion i s c e r t a i n l y going ahead an
the t e o h n l o a l s i d e of the c o l l e g e , but no pre-
gress appears t o be made towards making I.C.
r e s i d e n t i a l .
I am f o r o e d to the c o n c l u s i o n t h a t
the aim i s t o t u r n out automatons f o r the i n -

operate the f a c t o r i e s and the mines of t h i s
country without ever b e i n g troublesome about
the reason why.
I n the oiroumstanoes, s i r , I submit
t h a t gowns would be a mockery h e r e .

At the A.G.M. of the R.C.S. Union held on Friday,
May 21 at a vote of chinks waa passed to the Ministry of
Works for the work they had put i n hand for the conveni-
ence of the students and also for at last piping i n a
supply of drinking water - at present confined to the
Physics dept. A much more serious matter concerning the
Ministry of Works wa3 their b i l l for £61 for repairs af^er
the fracas that occurred on Feb. 16. The R.C.S. Union
was due to pay half, but did not intend doing so until an
itemised account was presented, which was 3 t i l l awaited"
nearly a month after requesting i t . The meeting signified
i t s apnrovj, , but were rather blank on methods of raising
the money (/.:her than a series of Da..ee3 already planned)
but were c ^ h a t i c that another collection was not the way.
Various reports were then presented. The Hon. Sen.
Treasurer was unfortunately not present but a disbeliev-
ing audience were assured that the state of the Union's
finances was satisfactory; the President's report spoke
of a most successful year during which not only had the
Rag or the century taken place but the R.C.S. had won the
Lowry Cup and al30 the College Sports and Tu<*-of-War far
the f i r s t time for 20 years. ,
During these reports each member drank the health
of the college i n beer from the cups that h»d been wen,
standing erect to do so.
The results of the Elections were then announced, v
the successful candidates beingI-
President P.A. Lenin Chen. P.1
'..
Vice-President M. Gadsden Phys.3. !
The various year representatives were then named,
there being the usual lack of anyone from the Teo-iogy
dept., and by "voting for the one we don't want" six memberj
of the mhtert»in«ent» Comittee were elected out of t'«e
>even proposed. J. Sherwood was elected the R.C.S. rep-
resentative to the I.C.U.Council.
The new President then took over his duties, I.e.
that of dealing with A.O.B. and after a pieee of quick-
thinking on the part, of the Secretary i n replying to a
question concemin*. the percentage of rotes oast In the
ballot, the President was congratulated on being the f i r e *
Legitimate one the Union had had. (the conetltutioa
iemands a thirty-three and a tnir.1 ballot for a v»Xtd
election). His reply that " i t ia » wine nan who teem
his own father" i» worth lu^lni?.
The meeting closed with a s-rioue aailsslon - there
wno no performance of the''College wnr cry.
