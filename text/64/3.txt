THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE
Editor t G.H.Starmsw. Circulation t 1X50
The academic year i s fast drawing to a close;
take f i r s t place i n our mind and there i s l i t t l e
tl»e for other activities. FELIX appreciates this state
of affairs and, so that our readers are not detracted from
their studies, this w i l l be the last issue of the present
session. We wish a l l of our readers success i n their
caning encounters with the examiners and hope that they
w i l l be here again to support FELIX next year.
FKLIX needs your support. I t i s independent of the
Union's finance, being about the only thing i n I.C. that
i s not a drag on the union funds.' The fact that i t has
to pay i t s way i s a spur to the efforts of the board to
make i t as interesting to i t s readers as possible - i f
wo don't always succeed i t i s not forwent of the attempt.
If there was any thought of a subsidy these efforts would
be lessened and that i s why FELIX wishes to be independent.
Why a l l this talk of finance and independence? This
tons has seen the introduction of SENNET - tho university
newspaper. Its standard of production i s far superior
to that of FELIX and since SENNET i s also sola for 3d,
wo agree that i t gives you better value for your money.
This i s partly due to a subsidy, which i s neoessary i f
i t i s to be a good representative of L.U., and also
because of a such bigger circulation. But because of this
begger circulation i t cannot report a c t i v i t i e s at I.C. so
well as a college newspaper. In i t s last i ssue i t stated
that Mr. D. Kale, i t s next editor, was at Guilds, but
FELIX i s able to report, more accurately, that Dinesh i s
a member of the Eoyal School of Mines - and proud of it.'
Since. FELIX i s a college paper i t should serve I.C.
well but, for the same reason, i t can never give satis-
factory coverage to University news which i s the purpose
of SENNET. Thus we f e e l that FELIX and SENNIT are com-
plementary, and that -there i s no need for competition bet-
ween us. Unlike the newspapers of other London colleges,
FELIX made no disguised attacks on the university paper,
but even co-operated i n using i t s own sales organisation
to s e l l SENNET. And next term, a member of the FELIX
board w i l l be editor of SENNET.
But i t i s no use FELIX regarding SENNET as comple-
mentary, i f members of .this college buy SENHET i n prefer-
ence to FELIX. We have already said that we consider
Sennet as f a r as the amount of reading i n i t , i s a better
threepennyworth. Nevertheless, for members of 1,0.,
news of a c t i v i t i e s i n the college are of more immediate
interest and i t would be a p i t y i f FELIX had~to apply for
financial assistance from the Union because of a reduced
circulation.
During the time that SENNET has been on sale, the
sales of FELIX have been about one hundred above those for
the equivalent issues of last year. This may seem to
indicate that there i s no fear of FELIX's circulation
declining but i t must be remembered that our readers have
the FELIX-buying habit which they have aquired during the
two terms previous to the appearance of SENNET. Next
year's freshers w i l l not have this habit but w i l l be faced
by two publications. We ask our present readers to edu-
cate the freshers regarding SENNET as the complement of
FELIX so that I.C. w i l l continue to have a l i v e l y jour-
nal f o r the dissemination of news of particular interest
to i t s e l f .
That FELIX i s a college newspaper i s emphasized by
the member of people who help i t i n some way or other.
Our thanks go to the President and Sec. of I.C. Union,
who have nearly always been w i l l i n g to 3upply us with news
and at the same time respect our independence - even i f
i f does moan that the facts are not always represented to
their l i k i n .
' We would also thank those secretaries of
clubs and societies who have continuously fed us with news
of their a c t i v i t i e s and especially for the f a c i l i t i e s to
FELIX reporters given by the Social Clubs Comsdttee,
Dramatic Socy., Cross Country Club, Eng. Soc, Padio Soc.
and Motor Club. We hope that a l l of these have been duly
rewarded through the reports i n FELIX and i f some clubs etc.
f e e l that FELIX neglects them, we would l i k e to say that
i f we are informed of their a c t i v i t i e s , i t i s almost
certain that one of our staff rd.ll be along.
Mention should be made of the debt we owe to the
Guilds registry who were a great help i n co-operating i n
the production of the rag supplement i n the Spring Term.
Also helping i n the production of FELIX are the ycing
ladies from the London College of Secretaries who do some
of our typing (the part without the mistakes) i n each
make-up Sunday. Then there are the salesmen without whom
the circulation of FELIX would be nowhere. There are too
many of thorn to mention by name but t h e i r work i s very
much appreciated by FELIX - i f not by the Guildsmen who
can't get by the gang of aggressive vendors mustered by
John Hanson, without buying a copy. We are v e r y
g r a t e f u l t o John DaviBS who has c o n t r i b u t e d t o
t h e p r o d u o t i o n ftf F E L I X by l e n d i n g u s h i s t y p e -
w r i t e r eaeh make-up Sunday, sometimes a t g r e a t
inconvehien.ee t o h i m s e l f .
Lastly, as edixor, 1 would l i k e to thank those members
it tho board who, though getting no benefits such as sub-
sidised travel etc. as with I.C. Clubs etc., give up
•tush of -Uieir time to FELIX. They receive l i t t l e of the
limelight and so some space can be devoted to their act-
i v i t i e s : Elizabeth Hamilton, the secretary, who keeps our
records straight and attends to the complimentary copies
- 18 are sent out to various London colleges alone;
John Pownall, treasurer, who vainly t r i e s to relate the
money taken each week with the number of copies printed;
A.B, Blake, advertising manager, who acts as an interme-
diatary between our treasurer, after the money and the
advertisers who don't want to part with i t ; B i l l Hudson,
circulation manager, often to be seen late on Thursday
evening trying to keep FELIX, and his beard, out of the
wheels of his bicycle; Don Grasham, publicity manager,
who i s responsible for the wonderful posters seen around
the college; John Seeley, the production Manager, who
has been the stalwart i n the negotiations with the printer
i n trying to improve the appearance of FELIX; Mary
McKenzie assistant to the productions manager.
Besides these there i s the editorial staff - Mac
Fraser, News editor, who seems to think that most of
t'.-;e things happening at I.C. go on i n the bar; Buster
Deacon, Features editor, who gives a true Journalistic
flavour to the board by never giving any indication of
his coolings or goings; Paul Harding, Sports Editor,
who i s renowned f o r never having attended a single board
meeting but no one can deny the success of the sports
page; Geoff Grimshaw,' coming events editor, the instiga-
tor of the improved layout of the Coming Events colunwi;
Roger Sykes, Art Editor, who with Peter Southgate (

produces the amusing drawings which enliven our pages;
Julius Kosky, Photographi.j Editor.
My thanks also go to our contributors - Ray Bonet
our c r i t i c at Drarasoc productions; Ian Kerr, our. c r i t i c ,
but not forecaster, of the Choir concerts; Trevor mtthen
who has been of great help i n trying to improve the pho-
tographs i n FELIX, even though the printer has usually
managed to f o i l his attempts; together with Bob Fillmore
M . P e r r l s and P a u l Teun*-
Lastly, but by no means least, I am very grateful
to Robin Bray, who has prevented me from making too many
mistakes, and Dinesh Kale, Editor Emerities, who has
always been w i l l i n g to do whatever was needed.
N E W S F R O M THE R E F E C T O R Y COMMITTEE
REFECTORY PROGRESSES.
The Refectory i s at last showing signs of recovery.
Losses i n the past two terms have slowly diminished, and
there i s reason to hope that they w i l l eventually vanish
completely. The only meal which consistently runs at a
loss i s breakfast, and i t seems ineveitable that i t w i l l
continue to do so u n t i l more custom i s found.
The progress i s due mainly to the efforts of the new
manager lir liooney, i n close co-operation with the Cater-
ing sub-committee. Readers must have noticed that quite
apart from food, small things l i k e more lights, more wa-
ter jugs, racks for trays on the sides of the tables and
so on have made the Refectory a far better place than of
old. It i s to be hoped that the improvement continues.
Wine - l i s t .
The Wine Committee had been set up by the i.ifectory
Committee to investigate and make recommendations on the
wine situation i n the college. I t has produnod a most
stimulating report.
I t recommends, among other things, that a wine-list
be printed and given suitable circulation. I t also rooom
mends the puechase of a snail loo mslrlng plant or r e f r i -
gerator, to be selected with a view to Its later re-inebft
a l l a t i o n i n ths new bar (which w i l l replace Committee
Rooms A 3 The committee are of tho opinion, that the
"cultivation of an educated taste i n wines should be en-
couraged by pricing wine as cheaply as possible. * The) re-
port also contains rexcomendations regarding wines and
