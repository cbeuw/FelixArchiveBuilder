World Cup fever hits the
humble iPod speaker-dock
Samuel Gibbs reviews the little ball that wants to rock your iPod
T
he World Cup is on its way,
about a month away now and
everyone with a product to
sell is jumping on the foot-
ball bandwagon. We’ve got shirts, flags,
footballs and even Pringles trying to get
a slice of World Cup fever. It’ll come
as no surprise that electronics manu-
facturers are also trying to get in on
the marketing buzz; the World Cup is
a brilliant motivator to get people into
stores and buying nice new large screen
HDTVs. Even the Chinese electronics
industry recognises the potential mar-
ket the World Cup provides, which is
why we’ve been sent the Lanchiya mi-
football for review.
OK, I know what you’re thinking:
‘Lanchiya, who?’ To be honest, I’d
never heard of them before, but
a quick Google shows you they
make a few different iPod docks
under the brand Speakal. You’ll
get no prizes then for guessing that
that’s exactly what the mi-football
is, as the name might suggest: a pow-
ered iPod speaker dock in the shape of
a football. The mi-football or miSoccer
as it’s known in the US, fits into a range
that comprises of the iPig, the iPanda,
the iBoo (think a Pacman ghost) and
the iPom, all featuring similar riffs on
the ball shaped powered iPod speaker
docks.
ball, which itself is available in white
and black or white and blue colour
schemes. The white panels themselves
are begging to have your favourite
clubs crest stuck on them, be it Eng-
land for the World Cup or Arsenal if
you’re a Gunners fan.
keep it nice and stable on a flat surface.
The bottom panel on the front houses
the mi-football’s IR receiver and LED
indicator to keep you abreast of what’s
happening, plus a duct for the sub, hid-
den in the black. Underneath there’s a
socket for the power adapter, a 3.5mm
socket for auxiliary audio and a switch
to turn off the mi-football, as well as
the perforated speaker grill of the sub.
Overall, the mi-football is any-
thing but sleek, but it is a grower. The
longer you look at it, the more attrac-
tive it seems, but it’s certainly one for
football fans, or someone looking for
something cute.
That’s the design, but what’s it
like to use? Well the mi-football
is a ‘Made for iPod’ device mean-
ing that it has access to the iPod
play controls using the touch
sensitive buttons and the iPod
menu system using the included
card remote. The remote has up
and down buttons, a menu button
and an enter button for navigating
through the various iPod menus. Vol-
ume, track skip, play/pause, a mute
button and a standby button are also
included, along with treble and bass
adjustment for fine-tuning the speak-
er’s performance and an AUX button
for alternative audio input. Overall,
operating the iPod or iPhone through
the mi-football is fine, a little frus-
trating using buttons on the remote
rather than a scroll wheel or kinetic
scrolling but as good as it’s going to
get using a remote without a screen.
Of course, to see what’s happening
on the iPod you’re going to have to be
within touching distance of the thing,
which to my mind slightly defeats the
point of having menu controls on the
remote. Another small annoyance
about the mi-football when it comes
to actual functionality is that when you
stick your iPod in the dock it instantly
starts playing at a default volume that
you can’t set yourself. That’s great if
O
nly six weeks left ‘til the
summer break. Whether
this means you’re finally
free of Imperial’s clutches
or just on remand, everyone’s looking
forward to a bit of sun (hopefully) and
a break. From iPod docks to phones,
from cameras to tablets, tech doesn’t
stop when summer begins.
We’ve got quite a few things to look
forward to in the tech-o-sphere this
summer. First and foremost we’ve got
the unveiling and release of a brand
spanking new iPhone. OK, it’s still
only rumoured, but if the stars align,
I’m pretty sure you’re going to find at
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
Another week’s done and dust-
ed leaving only six weeks left ‘til
the summer break, so let’s get
into it, shall we?
Sony turned a few heads this
week with the unveiling of their
much anticipated ‘ultra-com-
pact’ DSLRs, the NEX3 and
NEX5. The tiny camera bodies
sporting massive DSLR lenses
make the current crop of Mi-
cro Four Thirds snappers look
positively porky whilst sporting
Sony’s current E-mount lenses.
Packing a 14.2MP sensor,
1080i
movie
mode with an
articu- lating 7.5cm LCD for
looking at your glorious picto-
rial creations, the NEX5 brings
lots to the party. The NEX3
drops the video down to a still
respectable 720p/30fps. Avail-
able from next month, if you’re
after a bit more DSLR in your
compact camera then maybe
one of these beauties will suit.
Ever fancied designing your-
self a nuclear reactor but don’t
know where to start? Got an
iPhone or iPad? Well it’s your
lucky day because just like
everything else, there’s an app
for that. Nuclear boffins from
University of Utah have turned
to the Apple iDevices using
a freely available app called
ImageVis3D to display reactor
models and simulations on the
go. Great for the commute into
work.
Apple’s not had a great week
this week. First NPD announc-
es that Google’s Android has
bumped iPhone OS from the
number two smartphone spot
under RIM’s Blackberry OS. Of
course Apple wasn’t having any
of it and hit back with an IDC
report that said, worldwide,
the iPhone dominates 16.1%
of the smartphone market ‘far
outselling Android’
. Regardless
of where you look however, it’s
clear that Android is indeed
gaining traction in the smart-
phone space, something that
wasn’t always guaranteed.
Apple also took a blow from
another next-gen iPhone proto-
type going missing and turning
up in the hands of the Vietnam-
ese. Slight differences were no-
ticeable between this one and
the Gizmodo-acquired one,
namely the two screws from
the bottom of the device were
now hidden. A teardown
of the device also
showed the prototype
to be packing an Ap-
ple A4 chip, the same
one that powers the
blisteringly fast iPad.
Good news for all
those iPhone 3G users hanging
on ‘til June/July.
If you’re sick of your lap-
top and you can’t stand the
thought of a tablet, good news!
The Asus EeeKeyboard is now
available for pre-order! Pack-
ing netbook internals into just
a keyboard with a screen, it’s
yours for $599.

least one new offering from everyone’s
favourite fruity company.
We’ve got a whole raft of new cam-
eras to test including the Sony NEX5,
which might be the answer to all your
‘I don’t want to carry a beast, but I do
want amazing pictures’ needs.
Of course football is also on the
agenda, but it’s pretty low-tech for the
most part. All you need is a ball, some
posts and a pitch. But this year, players
such as Messi and Defoe will be sport-
ing the lightest boots ever, made from
a single layer of polyurethane. No pad-
ding means they’re faster turning and
lighter. Just don’t get stamped on eh?
you want an instant loud blast of mu-
sic, but if you’re looking for something
a little quieter or just want to charge
your iPod or iPhone, it’s extremely an-
noying. To make matters worse when
you do want to turn it down quickly,
the touch sensitive buttons that ring
the front of the iPod slot aren’t all that
responsive. In fact if you don’t put
enough of your finger on the button it
doesn’t register the input at all, leading
to frustrated stabbing at buttons whilst
trying to shut the thing up. It’s a shame
Lanchiya didn’t make a better job of
honing the button sensitivity or just
used physical buttons, but making sure
you use your thumb or a large finger
touch gets the job done in the end.
for the best part of £50 (£49.99 best
price at the time of print), it’s not bad
at all. For the price, it’s got punchy,
if not deep bass, relatively well de-
fined highs with a decent mid-range.
These speaker docks are often meas-
ured by their ‘room filling sound’, and
the mi-football certainly has enough
power and volume to fill a room. Its
sub moves an impressive amount of
air through its channelled duct at the
front, which can be felt blasting out in
operation and it shows in the loudness
that the little ball is capable of. Even at
high amplitude, the speakers in the mi-
football do an admirable job with little
to no distortion. There are a few cave-
ats however, mainly that the bass and
treble adjustments that Lanchiya has
given you on the remote do very little,
and the stereo separation of the small
closely packed speakers is pretty poor,
but considering it’s size and compact
frame it’s not much to quibble about.
Can you get better sounding iPod
docks? Yes of course, but the mi-foot-
ball holds it’s own in the budget price
range and at £50 it might be just the
bit of football tech you need to see you
through the World Cup.
On first impressions, it’s not immedi-
ately apparent what the mi-football’s
function is. It has a slot in the top that
takes the universal dock adapters for
your iPod, a few logos for the touch-
sensitive control buttons on the top
and comes with a little card remote;
but the actual speakers and sub are
hidden inside the ball. The sub, which
vents directly down is heard but not
seen, whilst the two stereo speakers
are hidden in the dark panelling of the
The ball is suspended off the deck by
four small legs with rubber pads that
OK, so it works fine for the most part,
but it’s a speaker dock, so last but
probably most importantly, how does
it sound? Quite good is the short an-
swer. Of course it’s not going to win
any medals for sound quality and it
falls a fair bit short of the impressive
and expensive Bose SoundDock, but
