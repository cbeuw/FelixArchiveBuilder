A comedy about Jihadist terrorists? Chris Morris is back
comic writers of all time, Chris Mor-
ris. The presence of the Morris on our
screens has been sadly missed since
the glory days of Brass Eye, the satiri-
cal show mocking sensational news
which pushed the boundaries of taste
to new heights. But Morris is back and
his new film is certainly not lacking
any of the controversy that made him
a household name.
A comedy about the pursuits of a
group of home-grown Jihadists from
Sheffield plotting a terrorist attack on
Britain sounds like the perfect recipe
to cause offense but Four Lions cleverly
circumnavigates any Islamaphobia.
The film’s protagonists are idiots, con-
fused between the anti-Western rheto-
ric they gleefully spout and the joys
of British culture they unintentionally
enjoy. The sanest member of the group
“Cake is a made up drug”, Bernard
Manning famously declared with ut-
most sincerity on Brass Eye, “One poor
lassie cried all the water out of her
body, just think how her mother feels.
It’s a f**king disgrace”. Manning was
just one of the many celebrity causali-
ties tricked into endorsing ridiculous
campaigns by the most controversial
Omar (Riz Ahmed) struggles to keep a
cool head around his band of deluded
brothers especially his lieutenant Barry
(NigelLindsay);awhiteconverttoIslam
who seems only interested in destroy-
ing mosques to inspire the ‘moderates’
to rise up. The lions are completed by
Fessal (a timid individual whose bril-
liant ideas include strapping bombs
to crows) and the innocent Hassan
and Waj who appear to be completely
unaware of why they are planning the
massacres of their fellow countrymen.
The brilliance of Four Lions revolves
around the fact that its protagonists
appear to be completely ignorant of
the religion they are fighting a Holy
War in the name of. The terrorists
are not shifty looking, “durka durka”
shouting stereotypes but your aver-
age man on the street. They under-
take their activities with all the bum-
bling diligence of Dad’s Army. Let’s
not forget now that Four Lions is a
comedy and so the question begs - is
it funny? Hell yeah, Chris Morris has
certainly not lost his touch and dollops
plenty of comic brilliance into the film.
Four Lions is hilarious and unset-
tling at the same time. Your sym-
pathies towards the men conflict
with natural repulsion at the terrible
atrocities they are trying to commit.
As the film reached its climax I un-
consiously found myself willing Omar
and the boys to succeed before recoil-
ing in uneasy horror at my thoughts.
The script bounces between well
aimed shots at the contradictions of
extremism and moments of surreal ex-
cellence. Omar explaining his predica-
ment to his son by substituting himself
forSimbaandOsamaBinLadenforMu-
fasa is a highlight. A fieldtrip to a Tali-
ban training camp in Pakistan results
in pure slapstick involving a bazooka.
Centurion delivers enough thrills and bloody violence

Centurion
Centurion may be a lot of things, but
boring is certainly not one of them.
The brief running time of 97 minutes is
hardly challenging to sit through, even
less so, when it is filled with brutal,
raw, medieval action that comes with
the ferocious looking warriors. In A.D.
117, the Roman Empire is facing diffi-
culties as it tries to expand its territory
to northern Britain. The Picts are giv-
ing the Romans hell with their endless
guerrilla tactics that have managed to
slaughter thousands of soldiers. The
Romans have had enough, and they or-
der the legendary Ninth Legion to wipe
out the Picts once and for all. But after
an ambush on unfamiliar ground, not
only does most of the Legion perish,
General Virilus (Dominic West) is also
captured. So now it’s up to the surviv-
ing Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender)
and a handful of soldiers (only seven of
them in total) to rescue him from the
vengeful Picts. The seven brave men
must also be incredibly weary of the
band of Pict hunters led by the ruth-
less Etain (Olga Kurylenko) who is
out for some more Roman blood.
As can be expected, the action is
literally non-stop and the characters
barely have the chance to get a word
in. A lot of the script is quite expect-
edly filled with constant screaming
but it’s hard to complain whilst so
much gritty action is taking place. The
fight sequences are relatively creative
throughout and they never become
too repetitive. The scale of these
combats can never be too big,
since the number of soldiers
we’re dealing with is limited,
and the director knows that. Neil
Marshall knows the limits and never
tries to be too ambitious. He plays
within the set boundaries and never
overextends himself to create some-
thing he cannot control. The action is
always bloody and it would be wrong
to expect anything but.
Marshall also makes the wise de-
cision of including some tense, cat-
and-mouse situations whenever he
feels like he has had enough of the
swords, spears and axes clash-
ing. The chases are hardly original,
but the rapid editing and fast pace
move the film along so quickly that
it’s hard to care. As the characters
spring, so does the audience. Because
of this general rushed atmosphere,
some plot details are lost in the process
but again, it’s easy to just forget about
them and get caught up in this high-
energy, adrenaline-pumping ride.
The faultless casting is also some-
thing that adds to the film’s enjoy-
ment factor. The range of more than
adequate British and Irish talent that
includes Fassbender, Liam Cunning-
ham, David Morrissey, Noel Clarke
and Riz Ahmed form a reliable, steady
group, interacting convincingly with
each other. Fassbender is fantastic as
the leader, showing both the strength
and vulnerability of his character flaw-
lessly. West, the macho general is also
well-cast, despite having some cheesy,
epic-wannabe lines to churn out.
Kurylenko, although having absolutely
no dialogue, compensates for this with
her deadly, piercing looks, an appear-
ance that practically screams ferocity.
Oddly, a romantic subplot develops,
and no, it’s not between the male sol-
diers. A random, helpful, innocent-
looking woman turns up out of the
blue, suddenly having a major part to
play. The film quickly shifts its tone
and decelerates. Frustrating, and per-
haps a tad unnecessary but we all knew
this couldn’t be 100% pure action. The
introduction of this character opens
up the possibility of the film reach-
ing a horrific conclusion and surprise,
surprise, this actually happens. Shame,
since the rest has been such an effec-
tive guilty-pleasure.
Though the plot and character have
not time to develop fully, “Centurion”
satisfyingly delivers what is promised
to: 90 minutes of hardly uninterrupted,
hardcore action. If you’re a non-action
fan, this is clearly not for you, if not, as
long as you can be patient during the
awkward romantic moments, the film
will prove to be tremendously fun.

My one problem with Four Lions is
that the Jihadists’ motives are never
really explained. Omar watches the
bloopers of his martyr videos whilst
his loving wife hugs his shoulders.
Why does he seem to enjoy a secular
lifestyle when he is determined to pun-
ish us ‘unbelieving kafir b**tards’? Al-
though the irony is probably deliberate
to point fun at the ridiculousness of re-
ligious fanaticism, I found I could not
fully identify with the protagonists and
therefore the emotional impact of the
ending was weakened. However, Four
Lions is still a fantastic dark comedy but
then I expected nothing less from Mor-
ris.
