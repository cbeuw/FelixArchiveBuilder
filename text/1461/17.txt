feel enamoured with. But never deny
a novel and exotic combination. But if
a perfume stinks, ‘It is a disaster when
you turn on the light’, says Jean-Paul
Guerlain. A signature scent is always
worth the leg work.

I
’m sorry that David
Cameron is the new
Prime Minister.
I’m even sorrier
that Nick Clegg
has taken
the arbitrary title of
‘Deputy Prime Min-
ister’. Not that there’s
anything political
about felix fashion.
But what with the
obsession with the
political wives, we
can only brace
ourselves for some
months of over-cov-
erage regarding mater-
nity wear and worse – a
year of baby clothes.
Such was the frenzy
at the newspapers and
fashion magazines: my
colleague at the Tel-
egraph spent a good 5
hours, post-election day,
phoning all the press
contacts out there, fran-
tically in search of the red
patchwork dress that Miriam Clegg –
or Miriam Gonzalez Durantez as she
prefers to be known - wore on elec-
tion day. Well done on Melanie’s part,
we now know that the dress is from
a Chiswick eco-boutique, from a la-
bel called From Somewhere and costs
£225. And now…?
I curse the day when Michelle
Obama became a style crush. Because
of her, Britain suddenly feels the com-
pelling need to propel our leader’s
wife into fashion stardom too. But we
won’t settle for just one icon. We need
three.
Fed up with the constant pestering
from the national press, Sarah Brown
now prepares a sheet detailing each
and every piece of her clothing items,
ready to be sent at the expense of a
media phone call. And once the info
arrives at any fashion desk, words are
to be said about her gnarly toes pro-
truding from a pair of red wedges.
Miriam Gonzalez. She can’t even be
bothered to contain her chesty pups
on election day. Any grown woman
should realise the importance of a set
of good lingerie. Any person, having
been under 40 years of gravity and
three labours (not
governments) later,
should realise
the need of un-
derwired bras.
As for Sam
Cam, I have
a cunning
suspicion
that she
wants to
help fix
her hus-
band’s
‘broken
Britain’.
To do so,
she blends in with the
kids-from-the-blocks by
donning a pair of bling
loop earrings. If Carine
Roitfeld cares to flick
through the Brit-
ish newspapers, she
may choke on her
morning espresso.
Andrew Marr
once complained
about the lack of ef-
fort demonstrated
by the new breed
of media people.
I now understand
why: comfortably sat
in their air-conditioned
office, who is willing
to set foot in the pol-
luted and congested real
world in search of real
stories when a potential
‘story’ is only a phone call
and one PR away?
The million dollar ques-
tion is: have we run out
of fashion stories? Or is
it simply that the fashion editors
are too traumatised after the bazil-
lion fashion shows they feel obliged
to attend each year, that they fail to
fathom the energy to march out of the
security gates on Fleet Street? If this
is the case, Cathy Horyn of the New
York Times should probably zip her
lips over the free Dolce and Gabbana
fur airmailed to BryanBoy. At least
he is ACTIVELY working it (whether
or not we like BryanBoy’s unabashed
seeking, ‘how I wish it’s a DSLR (cam-
era) but I can’t afford one, hu hu hu’
is another story).
Alexa Chung, Olivia Palermo, Dita
Von Teese, the Olsen Twins, Ece Su-
kan, Chloe Sevigny, Joan Burstein…
They all style themselves without the
need of a stylist and hence should
classify as bona fide style crushes.
So why, when there are enough style
crushes to fill the pages for at least 10
weeks, our national press chooses to
focus on the lot who purchase M&S
cashmere cardigans?
Not putting a halt on this sheepish
style of reporting will only result in
grave calamity. Mothercare has the
potential to become the new Topshop
with the arrival of another
Camer-
on. Get
very an-
orexic,
girls.
B
efore all sorts of raff-
ish perfume began to
invade the perfumery
counter, they were elix-
irs exquisitely crafted by
perfumiers. A century
ago, they began blending the most ex-
otic floral and wood extracts from all
over the world - Reunion Island, Cor-
sica and India...
Traditionally perceived as the fi-
nal element of an outfit, Guerlain’s
Mitsouko or Chanel No.5 are worn
and not gaudily sprayed. To piece
together a Balenciaga cocktail dress
and a set of Bvlgari jewelry, a per-
fume has to be worn to capture the
missing je ne sais quoi. Chanel’s par-
fumeur Jacques Polge hits the nail
on the head: ‘The aesthetic is lacking
something important when there’s
no perfume.’
Since day one, a perfume has been
serving more purposes than a mere
intangible accessory. You’re also buy-
ing a dream that perfume makers
sell. The latest Chanel No. 5 short
film, featuring Audrey Tatou is one
of these glamourous dreams. Audrey
sleeps on the Oriental Express, the
perfume bottle catches the light of
dawn and casts a scintillating shad-
ow in her wood-panel cabin. When
she meets a hand-
some young man, the
scent that emanates
from her is what cap-
tured his curios-
ity. ‘When a woman
disappears, what
that is left of her
is her smell’, such
is Jacques Polge’s
aphorism.
Unfold the pages
of a fashion magazine, how many
spokeswomen gaze back at you seduc-
tively in skimpy clothing? How many
touch their lips with their mouths
open? How many are accompanied by
a sexy young man? Are they youthful
or are they successful career women?
More so than ever, we are also buy-
ing a lifestyle indicator. The arbitrary
symbolism of perfume aside, how do
you tell apart a woman who wears Jo
Malone or Jordan?
Unfortunately, much to the dis-
may of the perfumiers that created
the scents, blindfold an amateur afi-
cionado and most won’t be able to
pinpoint the exact brand somebody
is wearing. It proves the point that
perfumes are so much more than the
brand sticker or the price tag. Expen-
sive as Victoria’s Secret scent may be,
Febreze probably does a better job at
freshening.
It is palpable that we need to look
beyond the veil that a pale and erotic
Sophie Dahl casts on a branded fra-
grance. We know that it is a mam-
moth task to sequester a scrupulous
scent from the squallion offerings on
the perfumery counter. The compiled
list here is the least effort felix can do
to guide you through the search.
Keep an open mind when it comes
to choosing a perfume. The classic
floral and citrus fragrant are easy to
“When a woman
disappears, what
that is left of her
is her smell”
The first fragrance created by Coco
Chanel, No.5. The latest of the film/TV
advert starred Audrey Tatou.
Dirt by Demeter Fragrance
Library is unusual to say the
least. Dirt is by no means a
gimmick, it does smell of a
damp dewy morning. Think
of a breezy meadow when
the fog is just about disperse.
While other perfume smells
of fresh blossom, think of
this as a the whip of fresh air above a
grassy/earthy pitch. Affordable, 30ml
is available at £13.98 from fragranceX.
com. Wear with a cropped t-shirt and
cargo pants.
Acqua de Gioia by Giorgio
Armani is a feminine
fragrance crafted by
L’Oreal’s Luxury Products
Division. It smells of a
still shallow sea that is
not too far away from
the shore. This scent is
inspired by rainwater as
well as terrestrial elements. The heart
of the fragrance is water jasmine,
mint and italian lemon. Wear with one
piece beige lace dresses. Hits stores
in June.
Paris by Balenciaga wears like
a French woman. It has the
sophistry of magnetism in the
form of a musky base, and a
baby like soft-core powdery
scent that is ever presence
throughout the lifespan of
application. Very demure,
this is the type of fragrance
that sinks into the background and
you forget about having worn any.
Bas de Soie is a new eau de
parfum by Serge Lutens.
Think a wild meadow filled
with blossoms by a running
stream. A squirt of the clear
liquid delivers an elegant whiff
of hyacinth, iris and grass
flowers.
Special No. 127 by Floris smells
like the bass tone in an opera, the
cologne’s base note is
a masculine blend of
musk and patchouli.
The manly notes
are balanced by the
mellow rose and
lavender.
Dream is a member
of the Incanto
series by Salvatore
Ferragamo. The
jaunty creation is like a child licking
a lollipop in an amusement park.
Smells colourful and sweet, it also
reminds me of freshly washed hair.
The perfume has amazing staying
power, it smells consistently lovely
and sweet throughout the day.
Buy online for around £25/100mL
White Tie and Tiara by Jo
Malone. This limited edition
fragrance will be available

support Jo Malone’s pledge
of £150,000 to the Elton John
AIDS Foundation. This girly,
sweet and summery scent contains
bergamot, tangerine, lime, hyacinth
and musk. Mixing and matching with
other Jo Malone fragrance will
create your own bespoke signature
scent. Jo Malone has a counter at
Harrods.
