Yeah. Not too many entries last week, but we did get a few. So well done to Kelvin Wong. As it’s
exam time all puzzles from next week will score DOUBLE POINTS or any number of points
that I can be arsed to give away. Deal with it.

How to play:
The numbers at the side represent the size and
order of blocks in each column and row. There
must be at least one space between each block.
Then insert the numbers from the box in the top
left corner into the unshaded cells and proceed
as for a normal ‘Slitherlink’:
All numbered cells must be surrounded by the
corresponding number of edges. The solution
consists of one continuous line. Any cells without
a number can have any number of edges.
See last issue’s solution (right) for more help.

Bridges 1,461
How to play:
Connect all the
‘islands’ together by
bridges running in
direct lines, North,
West, East and South
only, with no more
than two bridges
connecting any two
distinct islands.
Every island must
have a total number
of bridges from it
equal to the number
on the island and
bridges must not
cross islands, one
another or lead to
nowhere!
If you would like to design a puzzle and see it
printed in felix but don’t want to do one every
week, just send us your ideas to the usual place -
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk and if we like them
we’ll print them!
The winner of last week’s foray into bridges and shit
was Kelvin Wong so well done to you and all that
jazz.
Please keep these answers coming in as it makes
us feel loved and like we aren’t wasting our time. I
know we are and I would much rather be playing
flash games and pretending to revise but this will
suffice for a bit, So yeah, answers are pretty key to
making this feature work.

“You wer e in the SAF other day talking to
a ginger guy. You seemed quite close, so I
didn’t want to interupt. I guess I can now.
Can I borrow your APP notes for retakes?”

“Dear hot second year chemist, please
notice me? I know we could be good together
if you just gave me the chance. I feel like
one half if a sponge cake. Me, you, jam and
some buttercream might make the prefect
combination?

Only at Imperial would someone do this. Only at Imperial would we all find this a little bit funny.
Loving our Imperial lives indeed.
