Students apprehensively pleased with Phase 3 designs
As dBs is being stripped behind board-
ed-up doors, the Union’s Phase 3 build-
ing redevelopment team have released
the first artistic impressions of plans
for the interiors of both Metric and the
new (nameless) bar. Two detailed im-

site, along with lots of photos of the
work going on inside the old dBs.
These are the first designs to be
released to student opinion, and the
Phase 3 team are trying hard to gauge
it, in line with their policy of involving
students in every step of the develop-
ment. They are replying to comments
posted on the phase 3 blog with expla-
nations of the scheme and promises to
consider students’ suggestions.

ARTS
ANNUAL
OF
IMPERIAL
COLLEGE
dBs’ grubby façade will also be left
exposed to give a “warehouse feel” al-
though the dancefloor in front of the
stage will be wooden. The permanent
DJ booth behind the stage is described
as the “centerpiece of Metric, com-
plete with an LED acrylic wall which
can change colour and design”.
The scheme also gives more infor-
mation about how Metric will be used,
including a proposed low-ceilinged
area with comfortable booth seat-
ing away from the dancefloor. It’ll be
open seven days a week and although
not pictured, the plan is apparently
for removable furniture to convert the
venue for daytime use as well.
The bar which will replace daVinci’s
is also shown with exposed brick-
work behind the counter. The rest of
it is much more upmarket than da-
Vinci’s currently; plans show a pol-
ished wooden floor, concrete below
and above the bar itself and baby-
blue painted walls. Gone are the TV
screens and instead there are plans to
project sports and other programmes
straight onto the wall.
The Phase 3 team are calling for eve-
ryone with an opinion to comment
online, and are stressing that there is
still scope for alterations to the plans.
felix went out to find out what the
opinion was amongst students around
Imperial. Reactions were reasonably
positive although with typical pessi-
mistic style, one fresher described the
Bar plans as “way TOO nice” and an-
other commented “it looks classy, but
it also looks like a place where you’d
get kicked out of if you were wank-
ered”. The plans were also described as
misrepresentative because “it looks a
lot bigger in the pictures than it is” and
as “not stunning but they’re a step in
the right direction.” One Union punter
said ambiguously “if this bar was in
Hammersmith I wouldn’t go in.” Com-
ments online are mostly very support-
ive, and most people like the colours
and modern design, although a few
people were in favour of brighter col-
our scheme. One person we spoke to
said “it needs to be a lot more fun and
Artists’ impressions of the unnamed bar (currently da Vinci’s), left, and the new nightclub Metric, left. Students are wary of the overly “classy” look the Union have gone for.
colourful and have a bit more artwork”
and an online commentator described
the plans as looking like “oversized
bachelor pads”.
The biggest bone of contention
amongst everyone surveyed, both on
and offline was the furniture. Phase 3
were quick to point out that the furni-
ture in the bar “is only an indication”,
and would be discussed in a meeting
that took place yesterday. The chairs
were widely criticized for their unsus-
tainably light colour and fragility and
were derided for not providing a con-
vivial enough atmosphere. Most peo-
ple complained that benches would be
better to provide enough comfortable
seating, although phase 3 said that
benches were not consistent with the
atmosphere they wanted to create.
Metric’s plans were even more high-
ly praised as “definitely … an alterna-
tive to other clubs in London as a night
out”, “Fabric-esque” and “just the right
mix of student and chic”. Generally
the ‘industrial’ atmosphere was com-
mended although doubts have been
raised over acoustics in such a space
and how nice it would be during the
day. Phase 3 responded that they were
consulting with ‘professional sound
companies’ and that lighting would be
key to the day/night transformation.
They will also be working on measures
to prevent the club getting too cold to
drink in during the day. Many con-
cerns were also voiced about the dan-
gers of the concrete floor when wet for
drunk people slipping over, but phase
3 were quick to reassure students that
it would be perfectly safe.
There are a few comparisons of
Eastside bar with the new venue, both
positive and negative, with some peo-
ple thinking the plans look too much
like the existing bar-restaurant and
others describing them as a good al-
ternative to it.
