Rihanna’s
Reign @
the O2
Mariam Zahedi
isn’t revising. Instead
she went to the
O2 Arena to see
pop’s other crazy-
fashioned diva, with
all the elaborate sets
and aerial acrobatic
displays money can
buy.
Jack White takes more of a back-
seat than ever before, bringing Ali-
son Mosshart to the helm of this
spooky yet sultry blues outfit. The
album kicks off with “Blue Blood
Blues”; with bass stomping all over it
and Fertita’s guitar shrieking in dis-
cordant yelps. WTF ‘shake your hips
like battleships’ means I’m not quite
qualifiedtosay,allIknowis,itmoves
my bones. “Hustle and Cuss” sees
them slip into a more chilled groove
akin to 70’s soul band Funkadelic,
which contrasts with the twisting
snake-like “The Difference Between
Us” driven by Fertita’s Hammond
organ and Lawrence’s bassline. It’s
notable that this album is a more
collaborative effort than their first
album, with White restricted to the
odd burst of showmanship, like his
distinctive guitar solo on “Gasoline”.
Whilst several tracks feel unrefined
and in need of trimming, the overall
result is impressive, and serious ku-
dos to them for finishing on a jaunty
graveyard theme. - Tom Jennings

felix FRIDAY 14 MAY 2010

ight now, the music in-
dustry really is all about
the girls. Whether you
love them or loathe them,
there’s no doubt that the
likes of Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Cheryl
Cole [Ed note: Cheryl Cole?] and co.
are taking over.
RiRi has come a long way since she
first exploded onto the scene with Pon
de Replay in 2005. Only 17 at the time,
the song showcased none of her pow-
erful vocal skills, the video was hor-
rendously lacking in style and fashion,
and, most importantly, you didn’t get a
sense of who Rihanna is. Make no mis-
take – this girl is not your typical pop
princess, she’s wild, she’s dark, she’s
rebellious, and she does whatever the
hell she wants to and doesn’t give a toss
about what you think about it.
It may come as a surprise to those
who have seen her live performanc-
es on YouTube, but not only can Ri-
hanna sing in tune, her voice is also
compelling and powerful. Starting
her set with the haunting Russian
Roulette, the song showcased not
only her vocal talents, but her love
of fashion too, with a black dress
covered in red flashing LED lights.
The set was comprised of all the
big hits from her last two albums,
as well as some of the lesser-known
songs from her latest.
Memorable moments included
her performance of ‘Hard’ on top
of a neon pink army tank, the mini-
rave she and her dancers had inside

a neon cube for ‘Please Don’t Stop
the Music’, and the emotional bal-
lads ‘Take a Bow’ and ‘Rehab’ where
one look at her face clearly showed
exactly who she was singing these
songs about.
Her costume changes ranged from
Lady Gaga-esque leotards to big
statement shoulders, asymmetrical
body suits to gem studded FMBs,
and her on-stage dancing and gen-
eral behavior was at all times en-
thralling – she was clearly having
fun and the crowd was having fun
with her. This is one girl who defi-
nitely deserves all the attention
she’s getting.

I thought I hated this song and then
it got stuck in my head and now it is
growing on me. Completely unlike
anything they have done before, it still
has the distinctive piano riffs but with
the added hip-hop vibe. It is definitely
more accessible than their previous ef-
forts and is very radio-friendly... AND
my burlesque teachers are in the vid-
eo! Ha.

Topman Ctrl are throwing free tickets at
us to give to you for this show, so we’re
running a mini-competition for them, just
email us at music.felix@gmail.com with
the answer to this question:
In the wonderfully weird video
for “Ambling Alp”, what object
are all the naked people at the
end running towards?
First person to email us with the correct
answer gets two free tickets. Easy.
Yeasayer describe themselves as “Middle
Eastern-psych-pop-snap-gospel” but ac-
tually they’re an experimental indie band
from Brooklyn, New York. They released
their debut album All Hour Cymbals in
2007 and this year they released their
follow-up, Odd Blood.
Silver Columns are a home-grown duo
playing synth-pop folktronica rock
techno (that’s journalist words for don’t-
know-how-to-describe-them) that may-
be sounds a bit like Hot Chip, maybe even
better?
The Topman Ctrl tour involves different
Channel 4 presenters hosting different
bands in different cities. Nick Grimshaw
is the presenter hosting this show. Now
I don’t know who that is but then I don’t
own a TV. Or a laptop. I can’t even watch
iPlayer! Sad times.
