Bob Seger: “Dreams die hard and we watch them erode, but we cannot be denied the fire inside.”
Music Quote
of the Week
Shite all has
happened
CharlieMurdoch Coffee Break Editor
Congratulations to Ian ‘come here
little girl’ Fulton andAli ‘vote Nazi’
Philpott who were last’s weeks
winners. Boys, I know you love me
and these puzzles, but you spent about
three hours trying to compete this
puzzle. Well done, you managed it, but
on the other hand don’t you have an
exam to revise for?
On a different note, Ail has a bang
tidy sister, seriously Ali, she got all the
looks in your family.
As always we can put a guest puzzle
in, so if you fancy your name in print
drop us an email at sudoku.felix@im-
perial.ac.uk
[Include a puzzle with your email or
we won’t bother with the ink.]
E
veryone has been talking
about exams, politics and ash,
all dispersed with a little whin-
ing, that to be brutally hon-
est, after a while interests me about as
much as room temperature butter, i.e.
not much. Now don’t get me wrong,
I love a good moan about all the shit
that’s going down in the world, but re-
ally ash just reminds me of dead people.
So I am focusing on the better parts of
life at the moment... and a quick scan
of the horizon results in nothing. Yes,
nothing that exciting is happening.
Well, I got a nice fruit yoghurt with ex-
tra fruit from the SCR for breakfast to-
day. Made the mistake of taking extra,
or what I thought was extra, pineapple.
Turned out that it was in fact grape-
fruit. I fucking hate grapefruit. That is
a fruit that God let through the net, I
cannae see how people enjoy that. It’s
as enjoyable as eating bitumen.
Well, now that I’ve bored you to the
wall with that little antidote, I may try
to actually fill this space with some-
thing worth reading. However don’t
hold your breath. Apparently David
Cameron when once asked his favour-
ite joke replied ‘Nick Clegg’. Whoa! Roll
that back... is that some down with the
kids Parliamentary banter? Fuck the
kids! Now it’s come back to slap you in
the face like a massive lubricated horse
cock. (Yeah, I just wanted to print ‘lu-
bricated horse cock.’) Now even if he
did think that it was a good banterish
joke, which Dave, it wasn’t, he obvi-
ously thought that it was a good idea
at the time. Fine, maybe it was a good
idea, but you can walk down the street
wearing nothing but a thong. It’s legal,
but that don’t make is a good fucking
idea now does it?
If you want lengthened, and pos-
sibly more accurate rendition of this
week’s political news, I suggest look-
ing elsewhere. That’s all I have on that
subject. Moving on, I have developed
a penchant for poorly generated flash
games. I sit there, crunched over the
screen, closed to the world trying
desperately to get past level five on
Bouncing Balls. And those of you who
just saw ‘balls’ and laughed, grow the
fuck up. This apparently is what Gor-
den Brown is planning on spending
his free time doing now, although with
only one eye I can’t imagine him being
a threat to your top score.
Wordpath 1,461
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARDS
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WORDS -> SWORD
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 5 letter
word from any 6+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. WORDS-> CROSS (via CROSSWORDS)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORDS -> WARDS (by LS) -> WARES (by LS)
would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
ORIGIN:
PUNCH
DESTINATION:
FIGHT

Solution 1460
PUNCH
? ? ? ? ? via
[some steps]
FIGHT
What the fuck? This
is possible, but there
were no solutions last
week, thus I declare
it a rollover (and so
worth double points).
If you really can’t
do it, just send in a
memorable story and
if it makes me laugh
I’ll give you points. If
it doesn’t I won’t. Its
quite simple really.
Arrow Maze 1,461
How to play:
Fill all the squares with numbers to form a path from 1 to 49, such that the arrow
under each number points to the square containing the number one greater
(except for 49 obviously, which has no arrow, being the end of the path).
Hints:
26 is pointed to by three arrows but only one of them is pointing only at 26, so
this square must be 25. The square immediately right of 4 is only pointing to one
square so can temporarily be labelled ‘A’ and the square it’s pointing to can be
labelled ‘A+1’. Now we no longer consider ‘A+1’ as a destination for other arrows.
