moving the opressive regimes of the
Taliban and Saddam was supposed to
make the world a safer place, and this
may still come to pass, but the effect
of the invasions so far has been quite
the opposite.
The Iraq war was thought to be ille-
gal by many at the time, including ex-
UN Secretary General Koffi Annan.
Protesters gathered in their thou-
sands against the invasion. Intelli-
gence reports were far from convinc-
ing and in the end the sources came
down to mere rumours. Still that was
not how Blair portrayed it and Britain
was taken to war, following Bush.
While Britain was fighting on two
different fronts, expenditure on the
armed forces barely grew. In fact
Brown, after telling the nation and
the House for months that spend-
ing had increased in real terms, was
forced to eat his words and apologise.
In the end no government will ever
be perfect, that’s why we vote them
out.
New Labour had a significant and
likely long-lasting impact on Britain.
Many of their intentions were good
as indeed were many of their achieve-
ments, but after 13 years they have
had there chance, at least until the
next General Election.
Watching the massively underhand
way the Lib Dems played their cards
this last week, I expect they will pull
out of the coalition as soon as a ref-
erendum on PR is passed causing the
collapse of the government at the im-
mediately following Queen’s speech
or budget.
However, this decentralisation of
power from Westminster and White-
hall has far from been the story of
Labour. The past 13 years have seen
a massive accumulation of power at
Whitehall into the hands of demo-
cratically unaccountable civil serv-
ants and across the country into bu-
reaucratic quangos.
The result of this has been a series
of top down targets being set with
little to no reform of the institutions
being run. One appalling outcome of
this has been that while exam results
have been steadily rising, the British
education has been falling in interna-
tional leagues.
Other cases of this poor system for
running the public services have been
seen in almost all walks of life. Huge
projects such as the national database
for the NHS has soaked up enormous
amounts of money with no gain at all.
In general the NHS has not improved
as much as might have been hoped
considering the vast amounts of
money poured into it. Workers in ser-
vices such as the NHS and the police
have also complained the amount of
paperwork they are required to fill
in that feeds back into the Whitehall
bureaucracy machine. This is instead
of spending time providing care or
catching criminals.
Under Labour we have seen an
enormous repeal of civil liberties in
response to the rise of extremist Is-
lamic terrorism. The scale of this re-
ally has been repulsive, with, in my
view, the worst act being to allow trial
and then thrown at any given problem
it kind of had to.
Labour spent a great deal on the
NHS and the improvements, espe-
cially in waiting times, have been
dramatic: average waiting times have
fallen from nearly 18 weeks in 1997
to around 6 weeks today. Record
numbers of NHS patients are satis-
fied with the quality of care they re-
ceive, and the country has also seen a
fall in crime rates, especially in areas
such as violent crime during Labour’s
tenure.
Labour also implemented the Sure
Start programme which has been
given a resounding thumbs-up by
new parents as an all round centre for
early child development and support.
One of the first actions Gordon
Brown took was to make the Bank of
England an independent body, a wise
decision that helped to keep interest
rates low during the good times and
aided efforts in stopping the reces-
sion becoming worse than it has been.
The minimum wage was a Labour
creation as well, before its implemen-
tation several captains of industry
warned against it, but there will be
few people in the country who would
wish to see it abolished now. Had it
not been for this it is likely that the
difference in wealth between the
very wealthiest and the very poorest
would be even larger than it is now.
In an unusually liberal move, it was
Gordon Brown remembers he has already sold the nation’s gold reserves.
Looking back over the Labour years
R
ousseau once wrote ”The
English people believe it-
self to be free; it is gravely
mistaken; it is free only
during election of mem-
bers of parliament; as soon as the
members are elected, the people is
enslaved; it is nothing. In the brief
moment of its freedom, the English
people make such a use of that free-
dom that it deserves to lose it”.
So with the one day of freedom we
had, in what will now be a fixed 4
years, the outcome of that day was a
coalition government. Personally I’m
pleased to see the coalition which is
saying it will scrap the worse pledges
like raising the inheritance tax thresh-
old and most of the Lib Dem manifes-
to, and is instead promising more sen-
sible sugestions like scrapping income
tax for the first £10,000 and most of
the Conservative manifesto.
In about a month normal service
will resume and we can all get back
to blaming the Government for every-
thing. So rather than make wild pre-
dictions about what the future may
hold I’ve decided to take this oppor-
tunity to look back on the 13 years of
New Labour and see what went right
and what went wrong under some ri-
diculously clichéd subtitles...
“A new dawn has
broken, has it not?”
Sometimes, a convincing finger point is all that’s needed to take a nation to war
“British jobs for
British people”
“No return to Tory
Boom and Bust!”
The Good
When Labour surged into power
in 1997 their campaign song was
‘Things can only get better’. Un-
doubtedly the country has improved
in many respects since then. Frankly,
with all the money that was borrowed
The Bad
without a jury- what had been a fun-
damental component of our judicial
system.
The Lisbon treaty paved the way for
a more powerful EU which in turn
means a less powerful British parlia-
ment. On this issue Labour had prom-
ised a referendum, though this never
happened and as a result the British
people had no say in the matter.
The majority of newly created
jobs in Britain over the past 13 years
have been in the bulging public sec-
tor, while this has been part of the
force behind improvement in public
services, it has not helped provide a
route out of recession. At the begin-
ning of the Labour era there were
roughly five million people living on
benefits and there still are.
The ugly
Until Bigotgate, Brown’s most famous
phrase was that he had ended boom
and bust. A claim that came back to
bite him during the worst recession
Britain, and the world at large, had
seen in decades.
Of course Gordon didn’t cause the
recession, but his years of deregu-
lating the city certainly didn’t help.
Splitting up the responsibility for
monitoring the banks between the
FSA, the Treasury and the Bank of
England is thought to have slowed the
recognition of a problem and coordi-
nation of a solution.
Dr. Brown’s apparent success as
Chancellor was built almost entirely
on unsustainable borrowing and his
selling of British gold reserves at a
very poor moment show that he was
not some kind of financial wizard but
a conjurer of cheap tricks., By cheap, I
mean economy cripplingly expensive
tricks.
Labour’s most lasting legacy will be
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Re-
also under Labour that the Freedom
of information act was passed. This
has had a great impact on making
government more open and making
government statistics, figures and
the rest available to a greater range of
people.
Labour has also ushered in a great-
er social tolerance to Britain with
laws such as those allowing for civil
partnerships.
Perhaps one of the greatest achieve-
ments was to bring about the end of
years of violent trouble in Northern
Ireland. The Good Friday agreement
of 1998 and the 2007 deal between
unionists and republicans will hope-
fully bring about a lasting peace and
an end to the terrorist threat from at
least one area of the world.
New Labour also gave the go ahead
for the Scottish and Welsh assem-
blies, both of which gave people a
greater say over the governance of
their parts of Britain, and perhaps
eventually should the people of those
countries so desire, independence.
