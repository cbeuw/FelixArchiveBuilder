T
he 1st XI were in good
form having won both
their opening games and
so headed to the ‘home’
pitch in Harlington full of
confidence of picking up a third vic-
tory in a row. Skipper Ankit Patel lost
the toss and Imperial were put into
bat on a green wicket that promised
much for the bowlers with lots of cloud
overhead.
Anirudh Sompalli smashed the open-
ing two balls for one bounce fours be-
fore being undone by movement off the
pitch; a bizarre lbw decision and a silly
run out then did for James Musgrave
and Matt Tarr, leaving the side 30-3
after just 3 overs. Majid Ali then made
an eye catching 23 with some beauti-
ful drives and good support from Yasir
Malik’s 17. Ali’s dismissal brought cap-
tain Patel to the crease and he began to
calm a turbulent innings with a steady
45. He put on good partnerships with
Yasir, Adam Hugill and then Viran Par-
mer, who hit an enterprising 33 as the
pair put on 65 for the 7th wicket. Cam-
eos from Rahul Pai and Navin Surtani
lifted the total before IC were bowled
out in the 48th over for 210. This was
a modest total but given the nature of
the pitch, Imperial’s bowlers were con-
fident with their ability to defend the
total.
A good start was necessary and Vi-
ran provided this with a very impres-
sive opening spell of 3-26 from 10
overs, and he could have had more
wickets if his keeper and slips had pro-
vided more support. Surtani, plugging
away at the other end, lacked victims
to go with his control. Despite the loss
of these three wickets, Portsmouth
were threatening to get away from Im-
perial, with some very nice shots from
their batsmen. Fortunately, Superman
Patel again stepped up with a beautiful
spell of 3-28 from his 10 overs, remov-
ing the middle order that had looked
like winning the game for Portsmouth,
while at the other end Hemal Malde
kept things tight, bowling line and
length to restrict the batsmen. How-
ever, as the frontline seamers ran out
of overs, spinners Sompalli and Pai
came on. With little help from the
pitch, or Imperial’s catching, the Ports-
mouth number 7 chanced his arm in
a fortunate and fighting 50 to set up a
tense finish; Portsmouth needed 5 an
over from the last 10 with 3 wickets in
hand. Surtani returned and Musgrave
came on to both bowl very tidily, with
a wicket apiece, and “come the mo-
ment, cometh the man” with Majid
(not normally a death bowler) stepping
up to bowl and take the last wicket;
chopped on to the stumps with just
enough force to dislodge a bail and end
a thrilling match with a deserved win.
With three wins in three, Imperial look
to make it four out of four and all-but
secure promotion.
Men of match – Ankit Patel & Viran
Parmar (equal votes)..

After two disappointing perfor-
mances, Imperial 2nds hosted Reading
3rds in a relegation dog-fight. All was
well in the morning until Rohan Babla,
club secretary, somehow decided that
the start time was 2pm instead of the
widely publicised 12:30. After a socia-
ble journey West to T6 with the 1st
team, Pete decided there were no de-
tours needed and the rest of the jour-
ney was uneventful.
After delaying the match as much
as possible so that there was a chance
Rohan would arrive, Pete relented and
went for the toss, which he won and
thus decided to bat. The opening part-
nership of Jonny C and Yash, the 3rd in
as many games, got off to a good start
with a year-record opening stand of 15
before Yash got out for a solid 12. Af-
terwards, things looked up and in con-
trast to the 1st XI’s comedy top-order
batting on the other pitch, the 2nds
progressed nicely to 156 for 5; Jonny
getting 20, Joe Dearsly 34 and fresher
Sid a serene 57. With the platform set
for a big score, the loss of Sid lead to
the inevitable collapse to 200 all out;
Luke Smith smashing a quick-fire 14 at
the death.
Feeling extremely pleased with the
total, Pete and his troops went in for
tea and to refocus for the second half
of the game. The mood improved even
more when it was discovered the 1st
