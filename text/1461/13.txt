The most controversial movies ever
The Life of Bryan The Exorcist Freaks
A Clockwork Orange Salo or the 120 Days
of Sodom
The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre
The Passion of the
Christ
Cannibal Holocaust The Birth of a Nation
Monty Python couldn’t
believe their luck when
Life of Bryan kicked off
a s**t-storm with the
Church. Whilst the film
doesn’t contain much direct
blasphemy, it certainly is
heretical by lampooning
Christians as blind followers
of anything. Many
conservative councils felt the
need to ban it for years.
The Exorcist contains enough blasphemy
to put the even the least pious priest into
a catatonic state for years. Apparently
this film gave my mother nightmares
for a month. However, I found it scarily
hilarious. Mary Whitehouse was out in
full force during the screenings offering
religious counselling to the victims of
it’s audience. Why is it so offensive? A
twelve year old girl doing unpleasant
things with a crucifix and her privates
and the infamous head spinning scene.
o
Freaks was critically panned
and caused so much distress
to its audiences that it was
almost forgotten about until
resurfacing as a cult classic
viewed at midnight
screenings. It was
infamous for the
use of real side-
show ‘freak’
actors .
In my opinion A Clockwork Orange is
the most perfectly directed film of all
time by the master of cinema Stanley
Kubrick. Malcolm McDowell played
the leader of his gang of ‘Droogs’
with utmost glee as they engaged in
ultraviolence and raped. Banned in
Britain at the request of the director.
This film re-invented the
horror genre and it’s
audience were witness
to the brutal antics of
‘leather face’ and his
family of murderous
inbreds. The onscreen
violence was taken to a
new level but the film was
never banned in the UK.
Banned in the UK until 2000, this film
is the definition of the word ‘nasty’.
Set in the facist sate of Salo in Italy
1940, a group of high raning officials
kidnap eighteen young men and women
and force them into a world of sado-
machoism and coprophagia. Based
partly on Dante’s Inferno and the
Marquis de Sade’s book of the same
title, many felt that this was a snuff
movie dressed up as an art film.
I couldn’t find a picture for this film
which I was sure wouldn’t make
someone vomit on sight. The visceral
horrors in Cannibal Holocaust were
so horrible that it’s director Ruggero
Deodato was arrested on suspicion of
murder. The documentary style of the
film convinced some people that it was
a real snuff movie. Ruggero managed to
prove his actors were still in the land of
the living but his film faced international
censorship instead.
The furore surrounding Mel Gibson’s
account of Jesus Christ’s apparent final
day is best demonstrated by the South
Park episode The Passion of the Jew. The
original passion plays were performed
to incite anti-Semitism and so it was no
surprise that this film got critisised for
the same reason. The ‘good’ Jews look
American and the ‘bad’ Jews look evil,
make your own mind up.
This film is incredibly
important in cinema history
as it was the first real
feature length film to use
all the techniques that
are normal today such as
multiple shots in a scene. It’s
a big shame then that the
plot is about Klu Klax Klan
putting them pesky ex-slaves
back in their place after the
American Civil War.
With the recent release of Four Lions causing the raising of eyebrows amongst the more politically sensitive of
our nation, Film Editor Ed Knock presents the various films that have courted outrage over the last century.
