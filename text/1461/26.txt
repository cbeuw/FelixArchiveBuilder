Horo-elopes: Horoscopes, but running off to Jamaica
28 pages only this week? Pathetic. Is that all you can do, Mr. Editor? Oh, it is? Fair enough then
Cancer
Rumours are
circulating that
the Union is about
to be subject to a
bomb threat. The
same pocket of
Taliban extremists that targetted Times Square
are moving onto their next big target: Beit
Quad. Reports suggest that they’re not using
conventional explosives. They’re going to be
releasing volatile Arts students on us. SHIT.
Virgo
Don’t you just think
pigoens are the
most disgusting
animals on our fair
planet when you
see them pecking
at last night’s vomit? Well, you shouldn’t be
because last night, you were Pingo the Pigoen;
the super-pigoen with a strong penchant for
your mates’ regurgitations. You’re an internet
phenomonen. GRATZ.
Gemini
Bad news chumbo. Your
parents have woken up
to a headless son. Looks
like your Dad’s optimis-
tic attempts at lifting
35kg on the bench press
paid off in all the wrong ways. ‘Manslaughter!’ your
brother shouts. Your parents get the Fairy liquid
out and scrub-dubba-dub your blood out of the
carpet. Your mum points out your head’s just the
right size for a tea cosy. A leathery, humany cosy.
Pisces
It’s Friday? Surely a
good thing? Nope,
not for you. You’ve
got to head home
as your parents
say they miss you.
Maybe they’re being sincere. Maybe they’ve
turned your room back into your room.
Nope, they’ve still done the cliched thing and
turned into into a home gym. You go to sleep
with a 30kg weight hanging above your head...
Leo
This week you’re
fucking your girlfriend
like some kind of
superman and then
she comes all over
your cock and screams
your name, disturbing the valium addicted
grandmother across the road. She’s practically
worshipping your cock. The next day you write
a horoscope that 99.9% of Imperial students are
unlikely to relate to...
Aries
Why has no one
reported me to the
authorities, yet? You’ve
all been reading the
writings of a man that
clearly has only etch-
ings of his sanity left. It’s been nearly five years
I’ve been doing this, and still no one cares. This
is my cry for attention. Every week, without fail.
Please, someone, help. Do I have to spell it out
anymore? I NEED HELP.
Scorpio
This week you’re trying
to grind through the
last hour of your exam.
Unfortunately your
body has different ideas.
Your chest convulses
and you suddenly throw up over your exam paper;
blotchy, blood-stained gruel swamping your work.
The invigilator tells you to stop distracting every-
one. You wipe your table clean with your sleeve and
continue, the paper is soggy, your degree is fucked..
Libra
This horoscope is
neither fun or funny.
Still reading? What
about now? Even,
now? What if I change
language?

Taurus
Well, there you go.
It’s out. Everyone can
see it. There you are,
standing on the Un-
ion tables, knickers
round your ankles.
Everyone’s silent and staring. The stench is waft-
ing across the bar. People are leaving the room.
This is awkward. What kind of girl gets their bits
out on a Wednesday night? I’m a Tuesday and
Sunday girl, personally.
Capricorn
Yeh, it’s nice around
here, actually. Our
punters are all good
lads. All into their
football, as you can
see. Good result on
Saturday eh? You into football, then? Yeh, yeh,
we’ve got Beersberg, Beerenbourg, Beerlsch,
Beersweiser, you name it, we’ve probably got it.
We’ve got soft drinks too, of course. Take your
time.....Diet Coke? Sure thing. How big... Pint?
Aquarius
Get your growler,
get your growler,
get your growler
out for the lads!
Inside, outside,
upside to the hizzle.
GROWL-GROWL-GROWL-GROWL-
GROWL-GROWL-GROWL-GROWL-
GROWL-GROWL-GROWL-GROWL-
GROWL-GROW-GROWL-GROWL-GROW-
GROW- GET YOUR GROWLER OUT!

Sagittarius
OI YOU. YEH, YOU.
FRESHER-GIRL! Who
do you think you are,
reading the horoscopes
and laughing? I don’t
need anybody’s laughter,
least bit yours. Why don’t you go back to your
dirty room that smells of semen and learn your 21
amino acids PROPERLY. I don’t need your pity.
You think you’re so cool, laughing at a borderline
sociopath, don’t you? You’re not. Piss off.
