FAS* BIRD AND FAT SNAKE

Nah Osie, ur good at playin bass and basket-
ball, not DJing. Got ur stereotypes wrong. Is the

Barack_attack_l33thaxor
Cammy hav u seen dat facebook event for ur
house party? It’s well gay. Ne1 hu joins it is well
gay. They’ve said I’m djing - just coz I’m blak.
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Guys u need to come to my new house! Just
bought new cinema system for xbox. I’m gona
fill the hot tub with coke as well :D
The Nation’s favourite Children’s story. It’s got a snake with hair
This is FAS bird. His mum was a
drunken meth addict who died giv-
ing birth to his deformed head. What
a hilarious, yet touching back story.
This is Fat Snake. He’s a snake, but he’s
really fat! He wants to be a metal rock
god, but can’t play guitar because he
doesn’t have any hands. Silly Fat Snake
This week FAS bird is trying to revise
for his quantum physics exam, but he
has an under-developed brain so he’s
really stupid. HAHAHAHAHAHAH.
‘HAHAHAAHAHA. You’re so stupid FAS bird’,
laughed Fat Snake, despite being stupidly fat.
HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS, BUT WIN AN ARGUMENT
This made FAS bird sad, so one fine dreary evening he threw himself
off a bridge. Fat Snake never made it as a metal rock god. The End.
W
e have had to en-
dure our fair share of
mind-numbingly dull
debates over the last
few weeks, but not just from the poli-
ticians. No, as an Imperial student,
you are subscribed to an irrevocable
spamming of useless information
about the running of our government
from that smug student in the lecture
theatre reading the Financial Times.
Now I like to think that I’m moder-
ately intelligent, at the very least sen-
tient, but these people, wait no, these
robots can suddenly make me feel like
I dropped out of primary school to fol-
low a career in dribbling.
They ask you what you think of the
economic climate and you foolishly
reply, ‘I don’t care’. Suddenly their
eyes glow red and their automated
response to political ignorance goes
into overdrive; ‘You don’t care!? bleep
bleep bleep fiscal deficit bleep bleep
public spending...’. You just sit there
and fidget uncomfortably as you’re
bombarded to death by money words.
So how do you win? How do you power down that bureaucratic android?
STEP 1 - SHAKE YOUR HEAD in disagreement. It doesn’t matter if you don’t
understand what he/she/actually probably just he is saying, because he doesn’t
either. Just make sure you establish your objections. Once he sees you doing this,
he’ll become angry and will start throwing statistics and numbers at you. Don’t
be fazed, politicians use statistics like a fucking grenade launcher, only grenades
are real and statistics aren’t.
STEP 2 - Intermittently LAUGH at something he says. It doesn’t matter what you
laugh at, but avoid phrases starting with ‘a black man from Shropshire told me’ or
‘a dying cancer patient asked me’
STEP 3 - INTERJECT. Nothing aggravates the debater more than constantly go-
ing ‘but’ at everything they say. They won’t let you get further than ‘but’, which
is great because you don’t actually have anything to argue back with, you’re just
inching them closer to that inevitable aneurysm.
STEP 4 - KILL THEM with words and numbers. Political arguments might as
well just be a fight between Wikipedia and Britannica; it’s just facts versus facts
and the one with the most facts win (reliability of facts doesn’t matter.) When
you finally get the chance to make your case, the only path to victory is nonsense.
Just make up words like ‘taxify’ or ‘monetarian’ and then incorporate them into
your own made up government policies like ‘the bush fund administration for
counter-parts of the civil gold alliance’. Combine these with made-up statistics
like ‘the National horsing tax has gone down by 0.8%’ and your opponent won’t
stand a chance. The smaller the percentage, the scarier it sounds (to a politician).

The_Cleggomatortrontown <3
Cammy just checked ur public expenses and
u’ve already spent well over two mil! Hope u
put it towards the NHS and not ur coke bath :p
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Cleggman I thought we agreed that ur in charge
of fixin the economy and I’m in charge of the
taxes. Don’t ruin my dreams of a coke bath >:(
H
angman has always maintained a bitter-sweet relationship with the
social networking site, Facebook, but is curious to know what you
think? Sure it’s useful for keeping in touch with your friends you see
and speak to every day, but what about those cringe-worthy statuses
that make you want to murder a kitten? And has it reached the point where any
passing thought already has it’s own facebook group along with 50,000 members?
Now I know that many of you will be periodically checking your facebook home
page every two minutes, so why not make something productive of your addic-
tion and send Hangman a few screen shots. Here’s what I’m looking for:
1 - THE WORST STATUS - Send em in, (doesn’t have to be a screen shot)
but you need to need to provide a name to check for legitimacy, although names
won’t be printed. It needs to be a rage inducing citation, even if it’s just two
words; they’re often the worst; ‘LUCY JONES is hoping...’ What are you hoping
for Lucy? Why does everyone need to know that you’re hoping? Your ambivalent
status is either just there to annoy people or you’re hoping that someone will
actually reply and ask you to elaborate. Either way it makes you a twat! Platitudes,
flippant remarks or just plain stupid comments- name and shame. You’re failing
exams so take it out on someone else! It’s the right thing to do
2 - THE WORST GROUP - This will be a tough competition as there are too
many to count. Most groups annoy me so you need to find the most infuriat-
ing waste of web space out there. Remember that small African children are
working twelve hour days to provide you with these Face-
book groups so bring them to justice! I WISH FEEL-
INGS HAD A OFF SWITCH!!! (That’s what you’re
contending with)
The winners will receive the coveted HANGMAN
MYSTERY PRIZE! DON’T MISS OUT! YOU WILL RE-
GRET IT! NOW GO AND STAB YOUR FRIENDS IN THE
BACK :D Email hangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk
