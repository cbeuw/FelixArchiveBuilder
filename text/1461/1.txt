Funding review protest
I
mperial College Union took part
in a protest that saw students
from the 20 leading English uni-
versities demand that “disingen-
uous” tactics by their institutions
stop.
Ashley Brown, Imperial College
Union President, entered the Russell
Group offices alongside other student
representatives from across the coun-
try this past Monday. They handed
over a strong letter of protest insisting
that the Russell Group publish their
reports submitted to Lord Browne’s
review on higher education fees.
The Russell Group is a collective of
20 leading universities, including Im-
perial College. The Aldwych Group
is a the student union counterpart,
describing themselves as the Russell
Group’s “watchdog”.
The Russell Group had reportedly
refused to publicly divulge the content
of reports that were to be submitted
to the Indepedent Review of Higher
Education Funding and Student Fi-
nance. The review is led by ex-BP
Chief Executive, Lord Browne. How-
ever, a spokesperson for the Russell
Group told felix that they had “always
intended to make the reports publicly
available.”
Lord Browne had asked all relevant
parties from across the country to sub-
mit a first round of written arguments
and viewpoints for a review that on
completion, will influence the Govern-
ment’s decision on increasing univer-
sity tuition fees. The 1994 Group, who
represent a lower tier of British uni-
versities, have already submitted their
reports alongside around 90 other in-
stitutions. They are all publically avail-
able on the Review’s official website,
but one report’s admission has been
noted: The Russell Group’s.
Oxford University Student Union
had requests for freedom of informa-
tion on this report previously rejected;
The Russell Group had asked their re-
ports to be kept confidential until pub-
lication. Continued on page 4
