Dear Mr. H'a/fcer,
May / «je f/te columns of Felix to express the views of the
A.Sc.W. Student Group Committee on the coming discussion between
the Union Council and the University Grants Committee. I think I
understand why no approach was made by the Union, to find out
our opinions on U.G.C. expenditure here at I.C., but, nevertheless, we
have something to say. May I be excused for using this method of
petitioning Council, but other channels of communication seem
stagnant
Although the U.G.C. is concerned only with capital grants to the
College for building, maintainence, salaries of the College Establish-
ment, etc., and not with Students' Maintainence Grants, which are
assessed by another body {with which we are in communication), I
would like to point out thre ways in which the U.G.C.'s policies affect
students at I.C.
(1) The U.G.C. has delayed the aid whiclh they had promised
for the sports centre in Princes' Gardens. As the number of
students at I.C. will soon be over 3,500, much greater facilities
than are at present planned will be needed, and a start should be
made now.
(2) The U.G.C. should be congratulated for the many fine
buildings which we now have particularly in the City and Guilds
College, but the urgent need of a new Chemistry Building should
be vigorously stressed.
(3) The U.G.C. sliould be asked to provide funds to the College
which will allow for the fullest application of all the modern
techniques for the communication of information from the staff
to the students.
Yours faithfully,
KEITH CAVANAGH,
(Chairman, Student Group, A.Sc.W.)
Dear Mr. Colcutt

Dear Sir,
I am told that there was once
a time when it was possible to
find LETTERS in the pigeon
holes in the Union or in the de-
partments; but that must have
been before the ad-men took over.
Now it is almost impossible to
locate anything which might be
sent to you. It may be that the
photographic - exploration-Africa
Huxley-motor-society do have
meetings at which your attendance
is earnestly solicited, but there are
notice boards for these. If these
men, who are so kindly concerned
that we should hot run short of.
bog-paper, would also give tubes
of toothpaste or fourpence off our
"Scum," then we would not mind
so much. If they are troubled by
the lack of symmetry if some of
the holes looked empty then let
me assure them that assymetry is
the basis of modern design.

A reply to last issues article
From the Domestic Bursars
Office?
NO SUBWAY
Dear Sir,
I was interested to read in the
editorial of the last issue, that
there was a rumour of a possible
pedestrian crossing outside the
entrance of the Mechanical En-
gineering Building, in Exhibition
Road.
This road takes a heavy load
of traffic, in quadrature with vast
hordes of students walking to and
from Southside, and many would
appreciate some safe way of
crossing it.
Since a subway {the ideal solu-
tion) has been ruled out on eco-
nomic grounds, surely there can
be no objection to a pedestrian
crossing, or are the authorities
waiting for the suggestion to come
from a coroner!
Yours etc.,

Dear Viewers,
Having heard many praises of
the B.B.C. Documentary " Cul-
loden " and observing that it was
being shown last Sunday {i.e. the
3 lit) / set out on a tour of the
TV's of the College. First the
Union, where a large audience
was observing " The Secret Life
of Walter Mitty." Next to the
Southside TV Lounge, there the
country's future leaders were
watching a cowboy. Selkirk Hall
TV? Back to Walter. Tizard?
Cowboys again. Weeks? Walter.
Staff Common Room in South-
side? Cowboys.
Possibly I was the only person
in the Union who wanted to watch
this " Much-hailed " and "Excel-
lent Documentary " (Quote from
the Sunday Observer), but more
likely the reason is that the other
programmes started first.
It seems amazing that in a
College where you can take an
M.Sc. in Operational Research
in twelve months no one has
devised a way in which 6 TV sets
can receive more than two pro-
grammes.
