Engineers Dinnerjtejiee
As usual, t h i s was a very suc-
e s s f u l FridaA'- Evenihg, f o r the Guilds
Ents. Committee, under the gentle
touch o f C o l l i n s , had everything under
superb control. Mooney turned out
an impressive dinner: the menu was
masterful, w i t h French Beans and Pass
Francais. Unfortunately the knives
were t o o b l u n t to c o p e with some o f
the steaks.
Afterwards t h e r e was Roulette
i n the T.V. Room; and Stan provided
some very accomplished bashing of nhe
Joanna. In the Concert H a l l the Paul
London Orchestra played v i t u a l l y non-
.stop f r o m 10.00pm to the e a r l y hours.
The Cabaret was i s t h e s t i l l a t t r a c t i v e
fvvm of Evelyn Dorat, sing: ng an
a t t r a c t i v e mixture of French and
English s o n g s . Complaints were phoned
i n a b o u t the/noise, but i t i s unfair
t o l e t t h i s detract from her outstan-
ding performance. One of her many
a t t r a c t i v e gimmicks included an
attempt to dance with 'Guilds P r e s i -
dent Yog Bishop; unaccountably he
did not respond.
Unfortunately the evening was
marred by the presence of a number of
dishevelled s c r u f f s , only one o f whom
appeared to be accompanied ( he was
"also the i n l y one who was sober ).
At least three o f the gatecrashers
w e r e not paid up Union Members.
