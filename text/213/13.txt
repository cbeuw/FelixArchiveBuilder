CHRISTIANS ON THE ATTACK
This year's C h r i s t i a n Teaching
Week i s probably the most ambitious
yet. Already i t i s f u l l y i n prog-
ress, and one can't help being s
struck by the f a n t a s t i c organisation
thai: has gone into i t . The wheels
were set i n motion on Saturday
Evening with a meeting of represent-
atives i n each H a l l . On Sunday the
pace was hotter with Father Martin
J a r r e t t - K e r r j who i s the Leader of
the week, preaching the sermon at
Morning Eucharist. At Evensong,
the Rt„. .Rev, Joost de Blank also
ipQke,
On Monday, Father: Ivor gave
a high sounding'talk on the " New
Theology " i n a rather d i f f e r e n t
r o l e from h i s part i n l a s t week's
evCiiing debate.
On Tuesday afternoonpne of
the high spots bf-tne ^b3k, the
College was graced with the pres-
ence of the Archbishop of Canterbury
at General Studies. A .report of
t h i s w i l l appear i n the next main
issue,.
Already i t i s evident that
many -non belmeuers are taking part
i n , and deriving much b e n i f i t from, .
the a c t i v i t i e s of t h i s week. There
w i l l be c o f f e e p a r t i e s ^ ^ r e r .night-
