At Turner & Newall a man's degree — whether
in science, engineering or the arts — counts
for far more than a passport to a round of
interviews. Our Training Scheme is planned
to empfoy all his university attainments to
the full, and to be adaptable to his individual
heeds.
Just who are T & N ? Turner & Newall is one
of the strongest, most important groups in
British industry. With a large and growing
stake in asbestos-cement, in insulation, in
brake linings and in plastics T & N is closely
linked to all four major areas of economic
growth. To the building industry; the motor
industry; the newer plastics; and to activity in
the developing territories of the Common-
wealth ... all adding up to a strongly expand-
ing £100,000,000 business with 39,000
employees. Overseas, with 17 companies in
10 countries, T & N has doubled its interests in
ten years.
Earlier Responsibility T & N thus offers
outstanding graduates a career of great scope,
keyed from the first to areas in which expan-
sion is at its fastest. . . opportunity at its best.
Moreover, under our broad and flexible
training scheme, the graduate assumes
managerial responsibility more confidently —
and certainly earlier — than is often the case in
industry today.
Note to Research Men T & N also recruits
scientists and engineers direct into its re-
search and development branches, whose
projects are particularly closely linked to the
needs of the expanding industries. Opport-
unities for supervising work with a practical
application, as well as for fundamental study,
are thus outstandingly good.

Mr. K. D. Harris of G. E .
Bradleys Ltd., on Lasers (25 Jan.)
DEATH RAYS
Though at first sight Mr.
Harris' demonstration Laser was
not quite as powerful as Gold-
finger's, it formed an interes ing
focal point in his very illuminat-
ing talk on a little-known subject.
Lasers stands for light amplifi-
cation by stimulated emissive
radiation. The radiation emitted
is electromagnetic and occurs
when an electron, having been
excited to a higher energy level
than its normal one, falls back to
its more stable low energy state.
The radiation produced itself
stimulates emission, and if there
are sufficient excited electrons
present, a rapid amplification oc-
curs and a high energy pulse can
be obtained. The excitation may
be done electromagnetically, or
with intense light from a flash
gun. P-N junctions of semi-
conductors can also produce laser
action under direct electrical
stimulation by a similar process.
Gases, semiconductors and solids,
have been made to " lase."
The uses of Lasers in various
forms already form an impressive
list. They can be to great advan-
tage in spectrographic analysis of
minute samples, in range finding
on the surface of the earth as well
as objects as far away as the
moon (satellites), also to weld
microscopic wires or human tissue
in the eye
A more tar reaching possibility
is that of obtaining gamma radia-
tion by laser action. This would
be the D E A T H R A Y of science
fiction writers come true. The
shortest wavelengths yet obtained
are however still within the visible
spectrum, and we may hope to
hear more favourably of lasers
before we fear being struck dead
by them.

feathered in flamboyant plumage,
emphasized that abolition was not
the final step in murder law-
reform and deplored the " Primi-
tive thirst for blood and revenge."
Mr. Michael Scott, of U L U ,
was the weal on a fair skin. He
treated the motion with flam-
boyant and arrogant frivolity, and
would have annoyed most of the
House had he not made himself
look so asinine. Mike Edwards
replied without distinction.
FROM THE FLOOR
Floor-speeches included a de-
monstration of Ted Needham's
reading ability and the ex-
President of West Ham's debates
giving a delightfully feminine but
rather unconvincing case for the
abstention.
It seems, however, that the
cool reason of Edmund Gardiner
(or preconceived prejudice) pre-
vailed.
