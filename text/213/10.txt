HOCKEY IN FINAL
By E. Needham
I.C. 2—1 Q.M.C.
The I.C. Hockey team has
won its way to the final of the
U.L. Cup for the first time in
four years. Having overcome
C.E.M. in the quarter-finals, the
home side .found Q.M.C. an
easier team to deal with on Wed.
Feb. 3rd to Epping. How-
ever, as has often happened this
season, I.C. failed to produce
their best form against a weak
side.
The game started well for I.C.
with a fine individual goal in the
7th minute by Hough who drib-
bled 40 yds. beforefinallybeating
the goalkeeper. However, a
momentary lapse in the I.C. de-
fence allowed Q.M.C. to score
soon afterwards but the rest of the
half deteriorated into a stalemate.
The battering-ram tactics of the
I.C. forwards met firm resistance,
and the few breakaway attempts
by Q.M.C. were easily halted.
The second half started in the
same vein as the latter part of the
first until Stenning scored in the
49th minute. Q.M.C. never re-
covered from this deficit, and the
I.C. forwards were unlucky not
to score at least three more goals.

One point
makes difference
By I. Collins
•If future matches canfinishas
closely as did this one against a
combined University Colle.ee and
University College Hospital team,
the two I.C. strings at least will
be satisfied. I.C. won last years'
fixture by the odd few points and
this added to the needle element
inevitable in any contest with the
Bloomsbury Mob.
Play throughout the first three
sets was very even, and before
it had even begun, the match was
obviously going to hinge on the
last set.
In retrospect, it seems odd that
no-one totalled the scores at this
stage, to see exactly how I.C.
were placed. Anyway, the two
pairs playing last knew the points
margin to be small, whichever
way it went, and played accord-
ingly, until, in the second and last
game of this deciding set, I.C.
were leading by 10 points to 4,
and looked set for the match—
only to lose 11-12!
Feverishly, the points were
totalled. I.C. had lost by 74 pts.
to 73 overall, being even on
games, 4 each.

CHANCES GOOD
By M. Fitzgerald
With only four weeks of the
season left I.C. Men's and Mixed
teams are in good positions to win
their respective leagues.
The men's chances of retaining
the championship for the fourth
year running were increased re-
cently when Kings lost to Northern
Poly. This leaves N.P.' as the
only undefeated team in the
league, and I.C. have yet to play
them. A victory here would give
both teams the same number of
points.
Cambridge beaten
Recent league victories have
been recorded against Northamp-
ton 8-1, U.C. 5-4, and I.C. II's.
Last Saturday Cambridge Univ.
II were defeated 5-4, G. Simnet
and C. Woodward played their
best match of the season, winning
all three games.
The mixed team is still un-
beaten and victories over Kings
6-3 and Battersea 9-0 have put
them into a strong position at the
top of the table.

Easy win by
lovely I.C.
By R. Grundy
LC. 8 — 3 Christ's Coll.
After loss of the Cup and lowly
league posi ion, the I.C. team did
not start the trip to Cambridge
in extremely high spirits on Satur-
day, January 30th. To make
matters worse, the pitch was
rock-hard and the victim of a
very harsh cross-wind. From the
flick-off. I.C. went straight into
the attack and surprised them-
selves with some clever and well-
thought-out football. They event-
ually scored when Kemp latched
on to a through ball from Eastell
and cracked in a right foot shot.
He made it two when he again
netted from a similar position.
Quiet Blues
Little was seen of the Christs
attack which contained three
University players, for they had
little support, and when they did
receive the ball they seemed slow
against a well organised I.C. de-
fence. However, when Hunt made
no mistake in beating Wojtowicz
in the I.C. goal.
I.C., however, were in full
control and scored two quick
goals. Firstly, Wellfair deflected
a pass from Luxton into the net
and then Kemp notched his third
when he shot into the net from
close range. The visitors clearly
had midfield dominence at this
stage with Morland and Eastell
particularly prominent, and it was
no surprise when Eastell headed
in from a left wing centre to make
it five.
More Goals
After half time things were more
sven and Christs came near to
jcoring on a number of occasions,
eventually succeeding when the
inside-forward scored from a
dubious offside position. This goal
seemed to spark off even more
effort in the I.C. attack which
p weeded to put the issue beyond
ail doubt when Kemp and Luxton
added further goals. Moreland
then came up into the attack to
add his own particular brand of
humourous play in making the
tally eight. Christs added a late
consolation goal from their centre
forwa; I, but were indeed a dis-
heartened side.
This was a good win for I.C.
who played good football through-
out and, although winning by a
large margin still tried to the
fullest extent and never lost their
interest.

Although I.C. have comforably
beaten Q.M.C. once this season
the East Londoners have im-
proved considerably since then,
A dry day should result in vic-
tory for the fast and rather light
I.C. team and Riley will no
doubt be in there to add to his
twenty-four try tally.
Golf
By R. FuIIard
The Golfing Association con-
tinued its success with a 4^-1^ win
over London Hospital at West
Middlesex G.C. on January 27th.
During this match, John Ledger
who plays No. 1 for I.C. and is
currently the secretary of the
London University Blasters Team,
did a hole in one at the 198 yds.
18th Hole—a feat rarely accom-
plished.
Bristol University remain the
only team to have beaten I.C. and
it is hoped to reverse the result
later on this term at Bristol.
