FELIX '11
Gutteridge Cup
Motspur In Sight
By W. I. Jenkins
I.C. 2D—3 U.C.
On a fine but bit erlv cold
afternoon IC. took another step
nearer winning the Gutteridge
Cup when hey overwh lmed
Universi y Col'ege at Shenley by
20—3. After exercising complete
superiority in the first half, I.C.
rather slackened their grip, but a
U.C. side dogged with slipshod
passing and slow thinking could
make little headway and seldom
looked dangerous.
The credit for I.C's triumph
must go to the cooly efficient half-
back partnership of Weisner and
Mills, together with some superb
backing up and loose play by the
forwards. In this phase of the
game the back row was outstand-
ing, Davies having one of his best
matches to date while Hammerton
and Turner were ever on hand to
snap up the loose ball and launch
another attack. In the tight,
Howell dominated the first half
but fell away in the second. In
fact the only black spot was some
indifferent line-out play where a
total lack of protection for the
jumper cut the supply of clean
balls to a minimum.
Riley Dangerous
In the back division, Riley was
easily the most dangerous runner
on the field, while Turton and
Davison in the centre marred an
otherwise good performance by a
tendency to overelaborate, a
policy that gave winger Chapell
only two passes throughout the
entire match. The defence though
giving the spectators some anx-
ious moments proved adequate
Molam at full-back did efficiently
the little he was called on to do.
The game, started five minutes
late by a referee whose knowledge
of the rules appeared to be as
modern as his shorts, soon saw
I.C. firmly encamped in the oppo-
sition's half and after only seven
minutes the first try came from
Davison who dived over three
defenders to score—the kick
failed.

A period of intense I.C. pres-
sure followed, the lead being in-
creased to 6—0 some ten minutes
later through a penal y goal by
Turner. The next score seemed
only a mater of time and in fact
came from a scrum outside the
U.C. " 25."
Howell won the ball against the
head and Mills breaking blind,
again found Turner at his elbow.
The Captain took the ball, broke
clean and drawing the defence
sent Riley over for an uncon-
verted try. This brought the
score to 9-0 where it remained
until just before half time when
two more tries came in quick
succession. The first of these and
the best of the match was initiated
by scrum half Weisner who broke
round the back of the lineout and
turned back into the pack; here
Metcalf took the pass and tore
some 20 yds. before scoring wide
out. Two minutes later Riley went
over again. After half-time, a
rally by U.C. seemed to take the
edge off the visitors and though
Riley, and on several occasions
Davis, came near to scoring the
efforts were those of individuals
rather than the team. However,
U.C. made little headway and
after half an hour their fate was
sealed when Davison took a rather
forward looking pass from Ham-
merton to score near the posts.
Turner made hard work of the
conversion scraping it over
crossbar and upright. This took
the score to 20-0 where it re-
mained until the dying seconds
when an interception gave U.C. a
consolation try.
Thus what must be the College's
best X V in the last five years
move on to the semi-final, and if
they can only last the latter half
of their remaining matches as they
played the first half of this, victory
at Motspur on March 6th must
be more than possible.

Miserable Display
Shatters Cup Hopes
By P. Walton
LC. 2—6 Kings College
On a day well suited to good
football, LC. were beaten by
Kings at Harlington in the second
round of the U.L. Cup. Kings
won the toss and I.C. kicked off,
only to see Kings mount an
immediate attack.
However, the first quarter
showed honours even, but the
I.C. defence had already shown
dangerous flaws, and the talent-
packed attack had made little
headway.
Kings went 1-0 in the lead after
19 mins. from their centre-
forward, and after some near
misses by I.C. Kings increased
their lead by a header from the
lift winger. However I.C. retali-
ated in the 35th minute, with a
goal by Batcup from a Huxtable
cross, but Kings scored again on
half time, giving them a 3-1 lead.
IN T O U C H
WHERE HAVE ALL THE WATCHERS GONE ?
The Soccer Club have been knocked out of the U.L. Cup in the
second round; the Hockey Club are through to the final of their U.L.
Cup, and today the Rugby Club meet Q.M.C. in the semi-final of
Gutteridge Cup.
Before each cup game, notices and lists are put up in the Union
and Southside, and Felix always advertises the fact that free coaches
are being provided for supporters.
A total of about ten people watched, encouraged and cheered
all the hockey and soccer games, and the soccer team received the
support of four (two of them hockey players) on a day when most
football games and all hockey matches were cancelled. The Rugby
Club, it must be admitted is better off.
The winning of the various U.L. trophies means a great deal for
the prestige of the College and the Union and as anyone from Liver-
pool will agree a large following of support must do much to meet
this end.
Perhaps the Constituent Unions can do more in the way of organisa-
tion of supporters, and win or lose a " social" evening can inevitably
be offered as a reward.
In the second half the visitors
scored three more goals, two from
the inside left and one from the
centre forward, while I.C. scored
from a penalty (Huxtable).
This was a very disappointing
display by what on paper seemed
a very strong I.C. team, and thus
for the first time in seven years
the mighty I.C. have failed to
reach the final. This might not
have been so if the I.C. defence
had settled down earlier to con-
tain the King's inside-left who
completely outwitted all attempts
to foil his magnificent hat-trick.
I.C. Team.—Ingram, Fairholme, Bas-
nett, Hunt, Griffith-;, Crawford,
Batcup, Vaughah, Huxtable, Eastell,
Stoddart.

I.C. Maintain
Superiority
By S. Rowe
The first four matches played
in tlie London League Div. 1
show that I.C. are still a very
strong side. It looks as if I.C.
could well repeat last year's top
of the league success in an even
more convincing fashion. Three
players have featured strongly in
I.C.'s big wins. Clarke and
Randall have shared the goal-
scoring honours while Stapley has
always been a tower of strength in
mid-pool. Davis also deserves
mention for his sporting tactics
against Guy's star, Valentine,
whose goal-scoring efforts were
completely forestalled. One sad
aspect of the league matches so
far is that goalkeeper Banyard
has not been given much practice.
Banyard will need all his fine
abilities when I.C. face the big
guns of U.C. later this term.
