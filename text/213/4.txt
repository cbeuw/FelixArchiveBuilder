Guildfinger
The column born of our age,
replacing the old Spannerama.
The column that gives you the
news and views of Guildsmen.
by Brian King
The standard of entries is
extremely high. The prize for
the winners is four bottles' of
wine, including a bottle of Bollin-
ger Champagne. The judges will
be Messrs. Allen, Hardwick,
Throsby, Schroter and Solomon.
The prize for the viewers is at
least one hours high quality,
unique entertainment. And it is
all happening at the Guilds Union
Meeting, Thursday February 11th
at one o'clock, in room 542
Mech. Eng., and it's called the
Guilds " Festival of Music and
Culture."
Another important matter to be
discussed at the Union Meeting,
is the Film, which is to be " Shot
in the Park " in late February.
The film is in many ways signi-
ficant of the change of attitude
within Guilds Union, and perhaps
the middle of the year is the best
time for an appraisal of the pre-
sent situation.
The endeavours of the Execu-
tive may conveniently be sub-
divided into three broad sections:
(1) Academic: it became ob-
vious at the end of last year that
A.Sc.W. was making a deter-
mined attempt to grasp power in
Imperial College. This college
was for two reasons an obvious
choice for an attempt at a
" coup."
(a) there is a prevalant disin-
terested student majority, who
claim that the constituent college
Unions are too childish in outlook.
(b) Imperial is this country's
most important Technical institu-
tion and any organisation claiming
to represent the students within
the College, is assured of powerful
allies.
The dyke was breached, and
the valley looked as if it would be
flooded by the tide of enthusiasm.
In Guilds the attempt already
is, and can be seen to be, a failure.
It was doomed in its prenatal
state, for, at the beginning of this
session, the Guilds Executive had
realised that the academic sub-
committee was radically altered.
The reformulated committee, was
departmentally subsectioned, and
composed of equal numbers of
senior staff and students from that
departme.it, who were concerned
mainly with the curriculum of
their own department. Each of
these committees report their
findings to the Union General
Committee, who after final .cor-
relation, present the report to the
Dean. Since the staff are brought
in at ground level, the report car-
ries far more weight.
(2) Other Changes: Another
committee to be examined in de-
tail was the Colours Sub-com-
mittee, where new directives for
the proposal of colours have been
drawn up and implemented.
The whole operation has been
combined with an investigation
into the structure of Guilds
Union, and its powerful affilia-
tions, through the Old Centra-
lians, epitomised by the Union's
important contribution to the
Lord Mayor's Show.
The Freshers' Dinners have
been d'scussed at some length,
and a firm suggestion for a re-
orienta ion of the dinners will be
put to next year's Executive. The
live Heads of Department and the
Dean have been consulted, and
all viewed these recommendations
with great favour.
(3) The Societies: The societies
within Guilds are continually im-
proving the facilities offered to
members. Perhaps an outstanding
example is the Radio Society,
which is not only giving complete
closed-circuit television coverage
of the Engineers Dinner and
Dance, but is also hoping to
transmit vision on a U.H.F. Link
in the near future. The . other
societies are offering a strong
p'rogramme despite lack of sup-
port.
Guilds has not, nor never will
lose its sense of humour, and the
"sport" is of the utmost im-
portance. It is agreed by the
majority of experts on education
that books alone are not an edu-
cation and one of the most impor-
tant factors which contributes to
a well-rounded character is socia-
bility. One, and perhaps the
most important sources of these
experiences is (he Union. To im-
prove communication within (he
Union, a Guilds Diary has been
put up on the Notice Board in
Mech. Eng., and all year repre-
sentatives have typed copies and
details of future plans.
DRAMA CLASS
Catherine Robbins, a qualified
drama teacher who produced " A
Man For All Seasons " last term,
is conducting a new series of
drama sessions with a view to
improving the acting potential of
the Dramatic Society.
The first two sessions are re-
ported to have been very success-
ful, and have given rise to a num-
ber of ideas for future produc-
tions. Further sessions are being
held in the Concert Hall every
Sunday and Wednesday starting
at 2.30 p.m. Everyone is wel-
come and the Dram. Soc. promise
that these afternoon sessions will
be fun.
AN
OPEN
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU â€” and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
