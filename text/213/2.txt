Column
Things are moving—already three Carnival lunches have passed ;
the Carnival office has moved; and the Commandos got the 1965
Carnival off into a promising start in their collection at the Royal
Festival Hall on 1st February.
Perhaps you haven't heard about all this—then you can't have
been looking ! Carnival Lunches are on Fridays in the Union Con-
cert Hall, noon till 2 p.m. For only 2/- you can eat as
much as you like of assorted rolls and drink as much orange or
lemon squash (not n-times diluted !) as you want, to the accom-
paniment of canned music and live jazz.
Tickets are being sold all over the place, but failing other
sources, you can usually get some from Stan or the cloakroom atten-
dants. Come along this Friday—and bring your friends with you.
The New Carnival Office is in Southside—the committee room
below the bridger-and-chess room. Every lunchtime there will be
someone to enlist your help or answer your enquiries (phone Internal
3342).
The old Carnival Office in the Union has been closed.
The Carnival Magazine is due
out in mid-April, with a new look
(as Felix reported in December).
This year we shall be paying I.C.
students 6d. to take the special
student supplement!)
The general public will for 2/6
or more receive only the maga-
zine,, but students will get this
plus their supplement for 2/-.
It is completely different to
some previous carnival magazines,
containing both funny and serious
articles,
The 8-page supplement will be
crammed with jokes—for I.C.
perusal only!
Stall Building. Do you feel
energetic ? If so, why not come
and help build one of the stalls
to be set up in such big local
stores as Harrods or Pontings.
Maybe you know some big or-
ganisations through which we
could sell our magazines. Do
come and tell us !

UNION MEETING DEBACLE
Items from Felix-in 1962-3 spring to mind :—
21st November—quorate Union Meeting, 600
turn up.
7th February—LC.U. decides to join N.U.S.
by 405 votes to 389 in a debate which
lasted until well after 4 p.m.
7th March—I.C.U. reverses its decision on
N.U.S. by 315 votes to 254.
Against such figures to-day's report look grim.
RETAIN DEATH PENALTY 1
Arrogance and personal exhibitionism by one speaker marred
this evening's debate on capital punishment in the Concert Hall on
Tuesday evenings. He was perhaps encouraged by the Debating
Society's new pretentions at formal dress.
The motion that " This house would retain the death penalty "
was carried by 31 votes to 21 against (with 6 abstentions).
NO SUBSTITUTE
Edward Gardner, Q.C., Tory
M.P. for Billericay, proposing,
assured us that "The retentionists
were not impelled by any irra-
tional or unhealthy emotions."
There was no substitute for the
death penalty, he argued, but
admitted that " You cannot
measure the deterrant effect of
hanging." The police, who were
most intimately concerned with
violent crime, demanded reten-
Student faces have changed, but surely student
feeling is comparable—or have we all been
numbed into disinterest in the Beatle-era ? What
is discussed at a Union Meeting concerns every
one of us—not merely for our own welfare but
also that others following us may benefit from our
advice.
So, before 18th February, let's pull our socks
up, take an interest in what's going on, make other
people interested, and get all this wretched busi-
ness over before it's held over to the next acade-
mic year and, meantime, we grovel in our old con-

WHY CHOOSE C.E.G.B.? Because it is an ex-
panding, essential and progressive industry. The
demand for electricity is doubling every eight
years. The scope is enormous, with constant new
development in all parts of the country, involving
a capital expenditure of over £300 millions a year.
Present plans include 2,000 megawatt power
stations, 500 megawatt generating sets, 400 kilo-
volt transmission lines, nuclear power stations
and research into magnetohydrodynamics. Excel-
lent progressive salary scale, conditions and
prospects.

U.N. FINDINGS
Dr. David Kerr, a medic and
Labour M P noted that the UN
report on capital punishment had
found that judges and jurists were
generally in favour of retention
whilst more phychiatrists and
sociologists preferred abolition.
There were more exceptions than
applications of capital punish-
ment, he said, and cited preg-
nancy, insanity, and youth. The
1957 homicide act was irrational
legislation, and the supposed
deterrent had not been proved to
deter.
The battle was then transferred
to a more aetherial level with
Father Ivor Smith-Cameron's 4-
point opposition argument that
the deterrent was ineffective, a
negation of the Christian principle
of reform; he further argued that
juries were often reluctant to con-
vict a man to hang, and pointed
out amidst rather misplaced
laughter from the House, that
large numbers of bloodthirsty per-
verts applied to the Home Office
each week to be hangmen. The
Rev. Kinder, for the proposition,
gave the Scriptures the retentionist
slant "God deals in strict justice,"
he said and quoted "Vengeance is
mine saith the Lord." He seemed
to think that vengeance was a
state privilege too.
WEAK SUPPORT
James Mulcahy, a legal brain
and Old Etonian, took rather a
long time to make his proposition
speech relevant. He began with
an orgy of reactionary scorn
against psychiatry and sociology
but later argued that the sanity of
human life " demanded that" the
punishment should fit the crime.
