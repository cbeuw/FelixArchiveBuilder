Feature
sessions, and on Sunday morning,
again with a plenary session. One
of the most interesting features of
the Congress will be the Poster
Session, which will take place on
Saturday lunchtime, in which
researchers and interested people
will be displaying posters
An unprecedented
opportunity for
participants to meet
the speakers
illustrating their work. There have
been about 30 posters submitted so
far including several on chemical
weapons, a few on the psychology
of the arms race, and some on
developing world problems. It
should be a forum for stimulating
debate: in this era of glasn5st, we
are taking on all viewpoints. If you
have a serious piece of work which
deserves public airing, let us know.
For Saturday evening, we are still
hoping to organise a three-way
satellite debate with Soviet TV, the
BBC and a West German TV
company. BBC TV are covering the
rest of the Congress, as are Channel
4 and Radio 4. On Friday we are
organising a reception in the Science
Museum (all included in the
entrance fee), which will provide an
unprecedented opportunity for
participants to meet the speakers
and each other.
Now, being a scientist does not
necessarily give you insight into the
solution to all these problems, but
here are ways in which you can
apply your technical expertise to the
analysis and solution of the
problems these technical and
political developments present
humanity. Similarly, being a former
US Secretary of Defence or a key
Gorbachev advisor does not
necessarily, give you the monopoly
on wisdom, but it does make you
worth listening to. That's what
many of the participants who have
already signed up think. We have
people from peace groups and from
Ministries of Defence from both East
and West, coming to listen, to talk,
People from all shades
of political opinion
to provide their analyses of the
problem in posters and in
argument. We have people—policy
makers and their critics—from all
shades of political opinion. We have
students and professors from many
countries; the talks will be largely
non-technical, but will demand
concentration from the audience. If
you're interested in finding out
more, contact me in the Blackett
Laboratory.

Museum of the

South Bank Centre
A classic movie
Okay, I admit it isn't a film, but it
is as closely related as anything
could possibly be, and it's new, so
why shouldn't it be reviewed here?
No reason whatsoever.
Wave your student ID, pay your
£2.50 and you can pass through the
turnstiles into a world of diversity
and development, wandering down
corridors which meander through
exhibits showing all aspects of TV
and cinema.
The museum is split into three
main areas, though they overlap to
some extent. Initially there is a
section on early development, based
around the pioneers of moving
images, Edison, Marey, Reynaud
and the like. Since technology
advanced slowly in this era the
exhibits begin to look repetitive, and
although their history is recounted
well and in detail this is, quite
frankly, pretty but boring.
Having stumbled through the
story of magic lanterns and
zoetropes we come across the birth
of Hollywood and the silent films
which marked the dawn of cinema.
Here we enter the second part of the
museum. There is a change in style
'as the individual displays now
concentrate on development in a
particular field, sound or censorship
for example, or just a description of
that subject, make-up or set design.
This section describes the many
facets of cinema, past and present
and even includes a proper
auditorium where you can watch
classic movies.
Beyond this we enter the third,
more familiar area of television. This
fast advancing industry is shown in
ia range of technically oriented
exhibits as well as the usual
storyboard displays. Join in; push
buttons, read the news, be
interviewed by Barry Norman.
Whatever takes your fancy. Most
importantly you can discover where
the licence fee goes (down the drain
according to the museum).
And before you know it you've
passed another turnstile and into
the outside world, which begins
with a gift shop, of course. But look
at your watch. A fleeting visit of
only three hours. Time to see
everything, but not to overload your
mind by seeing it all in detail. Was
it worthwhile? It certainly was.
Where the museum excels is in
creating an impression of activity,
while retaining the simplistic form
of a passive museum. The
opportunity to press or do is not
abundant, but it is an inherent
feature of an exhibition like this to
include moving pictures. Watching
innumerable clips from movies is
more active than reading a card
pinned to the wall, and as a result
there is an everpresent feeling of
occupation.
As with any museum many of the
best displays are tucked away in a
corner like the computer graphics
simulation unobtrusively placed
amongst the many animation
exhibits. My only other criticism is
the limited international
involvement. There is little more on
show than British cinema and
Hollywood, and a touch of the
Russian Revolution.
So, next time you want to avoid
your Sunday afternoon problem
sheet or lab report, give the South
Ken museums a miss and wander
down to South Bank instead.
