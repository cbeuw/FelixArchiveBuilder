The 7am waker-upper nearly broke
my door down, but within five
minutes I was back asleep. I next
woke with the awful realisation that
myself and my baggage had to be
at the bus station within ten
minutes. Arriving at the coach office
at 8am I was greeted by a plump
gesticulating Turk who after some
time managed to convey to me that
I should have been there at 7.30—a
fact I knew but wasn't prepared to
admit. He rushed me down the road
and we caught up with the coach on
its meanderings around the town.
Half an hour later, sitting on the
coach from Van to Kakkari in the far
south-east of Turkey and reading
through my guide book I stumbled
across an interesting sentence—"The
journey to Kakkari is no longer
prohibited, but you will need a
passport to negotiate the army check
points'. A passport—mine was
sitting in the safe at Van's 'Hotel
Kent'. The thought of life in a
Diybakir prison did not immediately
appeal. The doctor sitting next to me
assured me that I was in deep shit.
Turkish and British coach travel
could not be more different. The
bus-boy comes round at regular
intervals to dispense free bottled
water and pour cheap cologne into
your cupped hands. Your
neighbour takes great offence if you
decline to strike up a converstation
even if neither of you knows not one
word of the other's language.
Turkish women travel little and on
a coach of fifty, usually only one or
two are female.
I decided to be philosophical and
settle back to enjoy the scenery.
After fifty kilometres or so we
passed the Kurdish castle of Hosap.
Perched on a massive sandstone
bluff which rises sheer from the
valley floor it resembled something
from a fairy tale. Hosap means
'beautiful water' in Kurdish, a
language which cannot be taught in
Turkey. The Turkish translation—
Guzelso—is used on the roadsigns.
The road took us over a pass at
2930m—debatably the highest in
Turkey—where snow was still lying
on the north-facing slopes in July
and we began a winding descent.
After being waved through what my
guide assured was the only army
check-point on the road we made a
stop in Baskale for refreshments. As
usual the bus was besieged by
earnest children aged about ten
selling peeled salted cucumber. Pide
(not unlike pizza), nuts, ayran
(salted yoghurt drink) and the
western staples of Coke and
Marlboro. Baskale is the highest
town in Turkey and I had little
doubt that it required some tenacity
to live here in winter with
temperatures down to - °C.
From Baskale we dropped down
into the valley of the Upper Zap,
which joins the Tigris near Mosul in
Iraq. The famed greenness of the
area was difficult to believe in July
but the ferocity of the river was in
no dispute. It was hard to tell if the
large concrete bridges which lay
broken in the torrent had been
bombed by Kurdish militants or
destroyed in the spring floods. In
any event most led nowhere.
Occasionally the conical tents of
nomads could be seen high up on
the mountain pastures. Their
scraggy sheets provide most of their
necessities.
Turkey has an admirable system
of yellow signs to provide directions
to tourist attractions but I was quite
perplexed when one of these
displayed the single word 'Iran'. On
the same road lies the town of
Yuksekova—out of bounds to
tourists and now temporary home
to thousands of Iraqi Kurdish
refugees. Before the 1984 upsurge in
the guerrilla war, Yuksekova was
the base for groups of mountaineers
climbing the Cilo Dag range.
Climbing in the area is now strictly
prohibited. Under martial law
tourists are restricted to the main
roads and major towns. Travel in
the Hakkari province is now less
popular with western tourists than
cholera.
Some kilometres after the Iran
turn off we bagan to climb up a
minor road out of the valley. We
were now less than 3km from
Kakkari and I began to relax. I
should have had more faith in
Turkish law enforcement. Within
sight of the small town strung out
along the winding main street we
stopped at police checkpoint. I
avoided any eye contact with the
burly police officers checking papers
at the other end of the bus and tried
not to think of the two edgy young
conscripts toting their sub-machine
guns outside. I sunk back into my
seat and fervently discussed the
beauty of Turkey with my
neighbour. All to no avail. I was
sitting in the little hut at the side of
the road two minutes later, one of
the conscripts having dragged my
rucksack upsidedown off the bus
the other watching me carefully for
suspicious movements. Just as the
coach began to move off the officer, _
in charge had a change of heart and'
I lumbered off up the road weighed
down with my rucksack. The coach
stopped, I boarded and tried to look
as cool and unflustered as I could.
Carved into the side of a hillock
facing the road was the ubiquitous
quote of Ataturk 'Ne multu Turkum
dygene'—how happy he is who can
say he is a Turk. This was rather
ironic in a town where, save for the
Army and myself, the population
are exclusively Kurdish; where the
teenage conscripts rarely venture far
from the main street for fear of being
shot and where Turkish is only
spoken when there is an official
within earshot.
I was met off the coach by an
officious plain-clothed policeman
with a walkie-talkie who confirmed
that I was the moron without a
passport and made sure I went
straight to the Hotel. Here I could
confirm that the receptionist at the
Hotel in Van had not yet found a
buyer for my passport. After much
form-filling I retired to the
sumptuous first-floor lounge for a
cup of tea and to update my diary.
Within a few minutes I was joined
by a thin, furtive man in his mid-
thirties. He watched me writing for
ten or twenty minutes before
plucking up the courage to talk.
After the usual pleasantries of
tourist small talk he concluded that
I was not a Government spy and
decided to tell me about himself.
