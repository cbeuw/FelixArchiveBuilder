If you have ever been on a family
picnic on a hot summer's day, or
ventured out into the sun in hotter
climates than our own, then the
chances are that you will have been
hounded by some of nature's most
vociferous scavengers—flies.
However, it is now the opinion of
forensic scientists that Mother
Nature's PR department has been a
little too harsh on these insects, as
they can provide useful clues to
some of the most gruesome crimes.
In September 1945 a woman was
walking over a bridge crossing
Gardenholm Linn, a small stream
that runs just north of Moffat in
Dumfriedshire, Scotland. She
looked down into the ravine below
and something caught her eye. It
was a human arm lying on the bank.
In the ensuing days the Police
collected over seventy pieces of
butchered human remains from the
site that was to become known as
'The Devil's Beef Tub'.
This was the beginning of the
famous Ruxton case, a landmark in
British legal history. A great deal of
evidence was collected and some of
the most distinguished pathologists
of the time were involved in solving
the crime. Amongst the evidence
examined were some maggots that
had been feeding in the decaying
remains. The maggots were
examined at the University of
Edinburgh, where their age was
accurately determined. The larvae
must have developed from eggs laid
by flies on the remains, thus their
age gave some idea of the time
elapsed since death, and provided
a strong clue as to when the murder
took place.
The remains were subsequently
identified as those of the wife and
maid of Dr Buck Ruxton of
Lancaster. Ruxton was found guilty
and later hanged. This was the first
time that entomological evidence
had been successfully used in
Britain.
Forensic entomology
The subject of forensic
entomology was born in 1859 when
a Dr Bereget examined the decaying
corpse of a child, and on the basis
of some fly puparia and certain
species of mites accurately
determined the year the child had
died. The subject was given a firm
footing when in 1894 P. Megnin
published his 'La Faune des
Cadavres Application de
l'Entomologie a la Medecine Legel'.
The central thesis of the book is that
the time of death can be accurately
determined on the basis of the
assemblage of insect species found
on the corpse. The idea being that
different species are attracted to the
corpse at different stages of
decomposition, and identifying the
species will fix the time of death.
In practice this principal is not
easy to apply. The decomposition of
a corpse is dependant on many
external factors, the fauna hierarchy
depending on geographic location,
season, local vegetation, weather
and so on. However, all is not lost,
very accurate determinations can be
made on the basis of the age of
larvae, although current knowledge
of the effects of physical factors on
their development is incomplete.
In general, as long as the
environmental conditions allow
insect activity, blowflies are the first
insects to arrive at a corpse, usually
about a day after death. Obviously
if the body has been concealed or
buried in such a way as to prevent
blowfies from reaching it then the
absence of larvae can also provide
an important clue. Blowflies can be
of use to forensic scientists in other
ways; by analysing the mercury
content of larvae in a corpse found
in Finland scientists successfully
located the place of death. When
maggots stop feeding they leave the
corpse to find a place to pupate,
often migrating large distances to do
so, in this way they can betray the
existence of a corpse!
One of the hardest tasks facing
forensic entomologists is
determining the time of death when
a corpse is several weeks old. In
such cases the age of any larvae
found can be of little use, as it is
unlikely that they represent the first
wave of insect infestation. The soil
fauna around the corpse undergoes
a change as the corpse decays. At
first there is a rapid decline in the
number, of individuals and species,
reaching a minimum after about two
months. After this the richness of
fauna increases, but may be very
different to the original one.
Knowledge of the seasonality of
insects can be very useful, for
example, if an exposed decaying
corpse is found during the summer,
Science
and lacks the expected fauna, it can
be said with some certainty that
death occured during the winter
months. The reason for this is that
insects are only attracted to a corpse
in the early stages of decay and if the
death had taken place during the
winter period, insect activity would
have been missed.
One important question
sometimes faced by investigators is
whether a body, or parts of a body
have been moved. Here forensic
entomology comes into its own, the
presence of insects in their wrong
habitat strongly suggests
movement. There are cases on
record in which bodies have been
transported great distances—even
across the sea, but where
entomological evidence has
ieventually uncovered the facts.
I
Case study
It would be wrong to end an
article on death without one more
case study! A man was walking his
dog in woods near Manchester
when he tripped over something
protruding from the woodland
undergrowth. On closer inspection
he noticed that the offending article
was a badly decomposed human
arm. Detailed examintation of the
corpse and surrounding fauna
showed a significant reduction in
the number of brachiopods, putting
an upper limit on the time of death.
Entomology is a very powerful
tool in criminal investigation, but
being relatively new has not been
exploited to the full. As in all
analytical sciences, a negative result
can be just as significant and small
irregularities in the age or habitat of
the insects can mean the difference
between a conviction or elimination
of a suspect.
