The President
Speaks
Accommodation
Since the old Sports Shop area has
been given over to STA many
people have asked what is
happening to the Sports Shop?
Where is it going to be? When is it
going to open? Of these three
questions only one can be
answered.
At the present moment in time
there is no suitable available site for
the relocation of the Sports Shop, so
it is unclear where or when a new
shop will be open.
The Bookshop and Sports Shop
Committee, who oversee the
running of the Sports Shop, have
decided that until it is known where
the new shop can be located the
Sports Shop will remain closed.
Clubs, societies and CCUs who
have regalia left in stock will be
asked to buy this stock at cost price.
If they do not, the stock will be sold
to anyone who wishes to purchase
it, whether it be RSM U G A ties or
any other exclusive regalia. Chas
Brereton will be informing the
relevant people with his usual speed
and efficiency.
The Sports Shop sale succeeded
in generating sales of over £11,000
and in so doing rid us of a lot of old
stock that was virtually defunct. In
order for the Union to recoup the
capital invested in the rest of the
good stock, held back at the last
sale, there will be another sale in the
JCR on Friday December 9. All items
will be vastly reduced from their
normal retail price with some items
reduced to only their cost price.
Look out for adverts and posters
closer to the time.

Internal Services Officer.

1. Motion on Rent Levels. SRC has
now agreed with the Union's
proposals over the rent levels
although they, like the Warden's
Sub-committee, have expressed
doubts over the practicalities. The
matter is to be discussed by the
College Finance and Executive
(F&E) Committees this morning.
F&E are the highest College
committees and they make
recommendations to the Governing
Body which are usually accepted).
I will report next week on the
houses.
3. External Affairs. At present this
Union has no policy on student
loans. As a consequence of this,
whenever I am questioned about
them I have to give my own
personal view. If this is alright with
the Union, then fine I'll carry on, if
not, could someone please come up
with a motion so that I know where
we stand.
outcome of the meeting.
2. Subwardens. The Wardens Sub-
committee of SRC has set up a
working party to look into the value
of Subwardens. The Party, which
includes myself, will look into their
roles, their accommodation,
numbers required, their
effectiveness and any other area
seen as relevant. I will be very
interested to hear the views of the
Well it's the RCS report in FELIX
again and a lot has happened since
the last report. The Freshers'
dinners were a complete success,
with the Chemisty and Life Science
and every other dinner going just as
well. It was good to see Guilds
taking an interest in mascotry after
both the dinners and it's a good job
to see they need such a lot of help
at it. There was a bit of a problem
after the Life Science Dinner when
some over enthusiastic guildsmen
'took out' some of our people with
a car. This is completely out of order
and the matter has been sorted out
between myself and Max Kallios the
C&G Vice President. Just as an
aside, the figure printed in
Guildsheet as to an estimate of the
damage to property was absolute
rubbish; the only damage that we
know about was to one of our own
cars, and was simply a headlight

4. Welfare. The first of the year's
welfare campaigns will take place
during the week beginning
November 28. This campaign is to
increase Alcohol Awareness and is
aimed at increasing students'
knowledge of alcohol and its effects
rather than telling them to stop
drinking. The week should
culmiante in a low alcohol and non-
alcoholic drinks promotion in the
Union and Southside Bars on the
Thursday evening and Friday
lunchtime. There will also be
displays in the main departmental
foyers along with a four-page pull-
out in FELIX to launch the week.
which was smashed.
Guilds have had a bit of a rest
with it being Rag Week and all, so
their Spanner and Bolt recovery
campaign has slowed down a bit.
You may have noticed them
providing a pizza delivery service at
the beer festival, this was all in aid
of the recovery fund, all in all I hear
it went very well.
RCS Rag seems to have had a very
good Rag Week. The beer festival
was a storming success; we raised
of the order of £1900, not to mention
what Scout and Guide and City and
Guilds raised. Thanks to everyone
who helped to serve and a special
thank you to those who helped to
clear up afterwards.
At the time of writing Gnoming

be a big success, with most College
notables being Reaped at one stage
or another. I don't know yet, but I

Posters. John Smith has assured me
that posters will not be ripped down
from the walkway and that his only
concern is the Science Museum
Library area and glass doors. I am
sending him a copy of our publicity
rules so that security can work for
us rather than against us.
A quick reminder:
1. No language other than English
may be displayed on any poster
even if a translation is provided.
2. The Snack Bar is a poster-free
zone.
3. Posters must not be affixed with
sellotape.
Bar Extensions. All applications for
extensions on Union premises will
be put to the Executive for approval.
Policy has, however, been agreed
that extensions for private/hall/
house parties will not be accepted.
This is to keep numbers to a
reasonable level so as not to
jeopardise other extensions for
parties of College-wide appeal.
Applications for extensions in the
JCR should be sent to Rob Northey
the Refectories Manager.
presume that the Smoking Concert
was a success and hopefully our
plans to raid London University
Halls of Residence will work
tomorrow. If you are interested in
coming along, turn up at the RCS
Office at around 9.30am on
Saturday.
Other things which have
happened around RCS recently
include the election of a new
Honorary Secretary, the winning
candidate was Gareth Smith from
Physics 1, congratulations etc.
The inter-CCU raft race last
Sunday was a complete disaster like
last year. The reason for the
breakdown in organisation is
debatable. As usual RCS managed
to play by the rules but nobody else
did. The whole thing is a joke and
as such should be sorted out. (here
