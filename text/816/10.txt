Music
Acid
House
A thousand vacant youths sporting
ten thousand smiley faces, except
their own. Beckoning skyward as if
to unseen hallucinogenerated
forms, in vain. The pulsing rhythm
shepherding their minds around
endlessly, it is bleat to the beat on
the modern British dancefloor.
The proported explosion of House
and its derivatives is artificially
elevated by bandwagoneers hoping
to hip-hop aboard the 'next big
thing'. They create mystique around
it and speak in hushed tones of the
underground movement. All to
disguise the obvious deficiency of
the music, it is dull. Turgid
plagiarisms layed flatly on a well
established beat. A deja vu bassline
and the odd inane phrase repeated
ad nauseam complete this, er,
exciting and original musical
artform.
'But it's great to dance to', is the
defence they offer. Those who are
worried that Acid House may just
be as boring as they originally
thought but are too afraid to admit
it: after all, a hundred million
lemmings can't be wrong. If it is fab
dance music then fine, but why
pretend it is anything else? Why
build the tower of youth culture on
something far too flimsy to support
it? Hype—why not. Be paid
ridiculous amounts for the pleasure
of seeing people part with money
several times for the same product
in vaguely different packaging. This
music says nothing—not to anyone
on this planet anyway.
So, time to put your mind
between the lines, catapult yourself
into a different plane on the good
ship 'Ecstacy' so that you can really
appreciate the subtleties of this fad.
Maybe, the next time you're trip,
trip, tripping along, you'll hit reality
with a bump and realise that it is all
crap.
LIVE
Robert Cray
Hammersmith Odeon
The Blues is black music and its
principle exponents, T Bone Walker,
Howling Wolf and BB King being the
most famous have all been coloured.
Eric Clapton might have his own
interpretation of this music but
listening to the Robert Cray Band it
is obvious that you need a dark skin
to really play the Blues.
Robert Cray is arguably doing for
Blues music what Bob Marley did for
Reggae. Constant touring over the
past fifteen years to considerable
acclaim has alerted the industry to
the commercial prospects of Cray
and a number of prestigious support
slots for mega-stars such as Tina
Turner and Eric Clapton have
exposed the record buying public to
traditional Blues. Cray is the ideal
figurehead for this revival. He is
described as singing better than
Terrence Trent D'Arby, playing better
than Clapton and looking like a
young Harry Belafonte.
His concert style is ideally suited
to Hammersmith. The band was
tight and supportive, allowing Cray-
himself to be more free and he used
the relative intimacy to talk to his
audience, even jesting good
naturedly with the hecklers; T don't
have to answer to nobody tonight'.
His normal band was augmented
by the Memphis Horns, sax and
trumpet and Tim Kaihatsu in rhythm
guitar. Partially crippled by arthritis
he sat for most of the performance
and appeared to add little until his
own solo spots in which he really
showed his worth. There was little
showmanship, the music speaking
for itself as Cray effortlessly blended
his solos within each song,
particularly on the material from
Don't be Afraid of the Dark which is
his most accomplished record yet.
As time progressed and the pearls
of the back catalogue were played
the solos became red hot, especially
on Smoking Gun and Right Next
Door. Contrast was introduced by
way of a slightly indulgent piano
improvisation by Peter Boe but the
night belonged to Robert Cray's
slender fingers showing us the true
sound of the Blues.
C.D.I.
Love& Money
The Senators
ULU
Having been fortunate enough to
find a seat in the upstairs gallery, I
caught the last three songs of the
support act, the Senators. I must
confess to being a little surprised
that a band with such a small billing
on the posters in fact turned out to
be a very solid, commerically
orientated band who I'm sure will
progess to bigger and better things.
After a short break, Love and
Money took to the stage, opening
powerfully with old favourites such
as Hallelujah Man. The set then:
quietened almost to tbe point of
being boring if you weren't familiar
with the songs (except for the single
Candybar Express) and was slightly
spoilt by the lead singer's
aspirations as an axe-wielding, hip-
thrusting guitarist.
Just as I was beginning to shuffle
uncomforably in my seat, the band
shot into what is, in my view, their
best single yet; River ofPeople closely
followed by Love and Money before
leaving the stage only to return with
a brilliant rendition of Jumping jack
Flash
All in all the set was good and in
places brilliant although I wish they
had played some Hipsway songs in
the middle.
Robyn
Hitchcock
Assassins,
Jazz Butcher
Town & Country Club
Act I. Enter the world of the
Assassins, A world of disturbing,
insidious music accompanied by
utterings of the grotesque, the odd
mutilation or murder and love. The
music is that from horror films when
they playflatfairground sounds to
create a feeling of tainted normality.
The Assassins use dischords and
misharmonies to produce effect.
Along with the visual terrorism of
the lead singer's eyes. This three-
man group is minimalist but their
stage presence and projection is
maximum. Their unclassable sound
does not appeal to everyone and
never will. See this excellent group
with an open mind. The stuff that
cults are made of.
Act II. A change of pace. The Jazz
Butcher are strange. They have all
the elements of a really good
band—original songs, fine lyrics,
good musicians and a character.
However, they still manage to
combine these flavours to make a
show of raw pastry.
Act III. Robyn Hitchcock is simply
himself. He has no pretentions
about being a rock star. He has been
performing for about ten years and
is quite unique. He has no definite
style except for the occasional
'wierd' song. Like Brenda's Iron
Sledge (which unfortunately he
didn't play tonight) and the
psycadelic Man with a Lightbulb Head
(which fortunately he did play). The
thing about Robyn Hitchcock is that
he can play anything and make it
sound right.
He was joined tonight by Pete
Buck from REM for no wildly
apparent reason but it didn't matter
why, he was just there with
excellent numbers like Heaven to
finish the set.

Maurizzio
Pollini
Royal Festival Hall
The Italian pianist Pollini gave this
recital as part of 'The Reluctant
Revolutionary', a festival celebrating
the music of the German composer
Arnold Schoenberg. Fortunately the
Schoenberg content of this concert
was limited to only three short
pieces. Described in the programme
notes as fascinating, these atonal
poems had no melody or rhythm
and could have been Pollini
warming up for all I knew.
This was preceded by pieces by
Brahms, Schoenberg's mentor who
took the trouble to find out how to
play the piano before composing for
it and followed by Beethoven's
Hammerklavier sonata. Written
orginally for Archduke Rudolph of
Austria, it gave Pollini a chance to
show his skill and dexterity, and his
passionate rendition earned him a
standing ovation. He responded by
giving two encores neither of which
were by Schoenberg, so that was
alright.
Maurizio Pollini plays a further
concert at the Royal Festival Hall on
November 10 and is recommended
to anyone who appreciates fine
piano playing, even if it is
Schoenberg.
