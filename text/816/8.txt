Russia's potential SDI launcher.

OF
THE
A f V t S
PACE
In early December, thirty-seven
scientists will be descending on
Imperial College to speak in a
conference which will address some
of the most pressing issues we face
as a species including how to get out
of the arms race and avoid the
otherwise unavoidable
The arms race is

enormous resources
consequences. They range from
R o a l d Sagdeev, President
Gorbachev's key policy and science
advisor, to Robert McNamara,
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson's
Secretary of Defence, and architect
of the philosophy w h i c h has
underlain global security since those
days, Mutally Assured Destruction.
T h e y ' l l be coming from East
Germany (talking about chemical
weapons, civil infrastructures in
war) and from Argentina (The arms
race in the developing world). Some
believe nuclear weapons testing and
proliferation are necessary and
unavoidable and others that they are
unnecessary and avoidable. They've
made key contributions to the
development of new weapons
( G a r w i n , Taylor) arid k e y
contributions to preventing their
misuse (Garwin, Taylor). It's going
to be feisty, contentious, informative
and, above all, given the calibre of
our speakers, interesting.
'Today, the arms race is draining
< humanity of enormous resources:
material, moral and intellectual.
\ i Unfortunately, science and scientists
| \have contributed to this dangerous state
I! of affairs. As scientists, as citizens of the
world, we have the duty both to
recognise this and to use our skills to
explore ways out of the present
situation.'
Thus concluded a meeting of 3000
scientists at the First International
Scientists' Congress, entitled 'Ways
Out of the Arms Race', held in
Hamburg in 1986. Since that date,
our group of scientists from East and
West Germany, France, Italy, the
Soviet Union, U K and U S A have
been working to provide a forum for
the presentation of ideas which
explore ways out of the present
situation, and a critical analysis of
current trends in the arms race. The
Second Congress here at Imperial
College will provide that forum.
What is the present situation? Is
it so dire? A n d why and how should
scientists contribute to finding ways
out?
We live in interesting times. Great
changes in the structure of the
global balance of power are taking
place. The massive transfer of
economic might from the U S A to
the Pacific basin has been coincident
with a massive post-way American
armaments build up. The gradual
fracturing of Soviet spheres of
influence have coincided with their
equally massive arms build up, and
the recent extraordinary changes in
their society's fabric. U n d e r
Presidents Gorbachev and Reagan,
we have seen the world's first
nuclear force reduction treaty-
doing away with a whole and very
dangerous class of weapons—while
every day we read of new nuclear
deployments, at sea, in space, and
in supposedly non-nuclear
countries. A further dimension is
added by the alleged, denied,
proven and continued use of
chemical weapons in the Middle
East, the planned production of
binary artillery shells by the U S A ,
and the undoubted Soviet block
capabilities in this field. N e w
technologies have p r o f o u n d
imphcations to nuclear proliferation,
miniaturisation, delivery systems
and testing, the verification of arms
control treaties, the ability to wreak
'first-strike' devastation on an
enemy, anti-satellite weapons,
submarine detection a n d
concealment, and the command and
control of nuclear war. The last ten
years have seen a technology-led
revolution in each field. O u r
Congress will, uniquely, give an up-
to-date assessment of the State of
the A r m s Race, a n d more
importantly, suggest definite ways
to end it. Scientists have an
important role in this endeavour.
Take, for example, last week's
news that the Soviets have agreed
to convert the contentious
New technologies

proliferation
Krasnoyarsk phased-array radar to
civilian use. This is a smart move,
since it may well have violated the
anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty,
and has led to many Western
factions giving support to the
Strategic Defence Initiative, (SDI).
This initiative—meant originally to
defend cities—is discredited among
most U S Administration experts
and defence analysts as being
unworkable. However, a weapon
hopelessly ineffective against
ballistic missiles could be very
efficient in knocking out satellites
w h i c h could be disastrously
destabilising i n its effect o n
verification and early warning
systems; making the likelihood of
disaster much greater. What's more,
scaled-down SDI plans threaten that
cornerstone of non-proliferation in
space, the A B M treaty.
N o w , the assessment of
Krasnoyarsk relies on a working
knowledge of its capabilities. The
assesment of Soviet sincerity in its
conversion will rely on a working
knowledge of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences' intentions and the
means to ensure they're carried out.
We're delighted, therefore, that we
have three heads and one former
head of department of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences to tell us about
their plans. The implications of the
latest Soviet move deserve very
careful assessment, especially in the
light of their o w n research in SDI
related technologies.
Another area where scientists
should contribute is in the very
contentious issue of whether there
is the need to test nuclear weapons.
Scientists have an
important role in this
endeavour
The current of opinion now seems
to be saying that, besides being
escalatory and damaging to our
already creaking environment,
nuclear tests of weapons are
technically unnecessary. The debate
continues, a n d underlies the
fundamental issue of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If
this were signed and ratified, could
we ever know if the Soviets or the
Americans were cheating by just
testing small, seismically decoupled
warheads? The answer is probably
'Yes', but obviously deserves careful
thought.
The Congress will take place on
Friday evening (2nd December),
with a Plenary Session in the Main
Hall, on Saturday in three parallel
