The Science Fiction Society has an
excessively busy week next week
This starts at 7pm on Tuesday in
ME220, with our latest film the John
Carpenter version of The Thing.
With impressive special effects, a
decidedly paranoid and
claustrophobic atmosphere, this film
is probably one of Carpenter's best
It stars Kurt Russell as a crew
member on an Antarctic base
menaced by a mysterious alien that
has already destroyed a similar
camp. And the alien can disguise
itself as the exact likeness of any of
the base's crew. Watch out for the
walking head!
Then on Wednesday lunchtime
we have something more serious. In
Huxley 144 at 2pm, Gerry Webb,
director of Commercial Space
Technologies, and partner of the
" HOTOL designer Alan Bond will
ask the question, 'Is the British
Space Program Science Fiction?',
and look at the ways space will be
used over the next thirty years. Will
Britain be playing any role? Ask
Gerry, and you may get some very
interesting, and new, answers about
where we are going, and whether
HOTOL will ever get off the
ground.
Thursday evening, we have the
inaugural meeting of the Writers oi
ICSF. Anyone interested in writing
science fiction, or maybe just
imrpoving any of their writing,
should come to the Green
Committee Room at 7.30pm.
Submissions for the Writing Group,
or for our soon to be published
magazine, should go to the ICSF
pigeonhole in the Union Office.
Then on Friday, ICSF proudly
presents an all night showing ol
Science Fiction and Fantasy on
STOIC. This can be seen in halls,
and on our special monitor in the
UDH. Among others we shall be
showing Edge of Darkness, Troy
Kennedy Martin's famous political
TV thriller on nuclear nightmares
and Gaian ecology. Does Jedburgh
Live? Come along and find out!

Things
This coming week at Filmsoc we'll
be showing White Mischief. It's one
of those stylish period pieces British
film makers do best. Set in Kenya
in colonial times it is a story of high
society affairs and murder, starring
Greta Scacchi and Charles Dance
(remember him from Jewel in the
Crown?).
See 'What's On' for details and as
if that-wasn't enough we're doing
a special offer on membership this
week too. It will only cost you £3 to
join Filmsoc which entitles you to
free entry on-the night you join and
half price entry thereafter. So you'll
be saving money after only five
films. Also we're looking for new
committee members. For just a little
help setting up, putting away and
projecting you get into all the films
free, choose what we show and it
looks good on your CV. Have a
word with any committee member
when you come to watch a film.
We're nice people really.

We are the College's all-round
outdoor club, but if you saw what
we were doing last weekend, you
probably wouldn't think so! It was
our annual 'social' weekend, where
we hire the requisite number of
barges and descend upon some
beautiful part of Britain's
waterways. This year we travelled
to Rugby and the Grand Union
Canal. If you think there's nothing
much to do on a barge, think again.
If, at some point you don't fall in
attempting to climb over bridges, or
some other silly stunt then the Club
will gladly bring the canal to you,
in any available container large
enough!
Of course, if your name is Fiona,
then this is not necessary, as was
soon discovered! One rule you must
always remember though—never
leave your boat unattended, it might
not be there when you return. All
in all, it was a great success.
This was the Club's third
weekend this term—our trips are
fortnightly. The previous two were
'normal' activity weekends in
Derbyshire and the Brecon Beacons,
where we walked, climbed and
played silly games before retiring to
an unsuspecting pub!
Next week, we're off to
Snowdonia for a spot of the same.
If you're interested in what we do,
see us any day at 12.30 above
Southside Bar for butties, except
Thursday when we meet in Mines
B303 for a video or talk.
Alternatively contact Colin
Anderson or Robin Burnett through
Mech Eng pigeonholes.
Arguments
On Friday 4 October, Imperial
College Debating Society was
invited to send two teams to a
debating competition at Bristol
University.
Unfortunately the invitation did
not arrive until Thursday and rapid
plans were made to get volunteers.
The event was organised by
Bristol University Union, and
sponsored by Lloyds bank who
hopefully would pay all travel
expenses, food and hotel bills.
The preliminary round was a
prepared debate entitled 'this house
believes that life begins on
graduation day'. Being in
opposition, both IC teams explained
the dreads of London apart from
other things. Our teams were
comprised of; Mark Gialanze and
Dave Roberts for one team and
Lynder Matthews and Paul Bayton
for the other.
The debating was both vigorous,
dynamic and exciting, yet also very
courteous, and rules of the house in
general observed.
Both IC teams did exceedingly
well, especially considering some of
the members had no debating
experience like this before, and they
raised several points of information
and made powerful speeches in
opposition to the motion. IC faced
stiff competition from much more
experienced Oxford, LSE and
Brunei teams, most of which were
composed of students of the arfs,
many of which were law students
whose very job it is to debate, and
with debating societies over twenty
times bigger than IC's. Both
Imperial teams were thus knocked
out after the first round.
In the evening the unprepared
intermediary and prepared final
round was held, where the debating
was even fiercer, and very
entertaining. The morions were 'this
house believes that a green world is
detrimental to the comfort of man'
and 'this house believes that a
terrorist's life is as important as a
soldier's.
The team from LSE won.
Dabating can be great fun, and if
you want to take part in debates
such as this one (there's two debates
coming up), or would like to partake
in more informal debates, or would
simply like to listen, then why not
join Debsoc. You needn't be an
experienced debater to join—Debsoc
caters for all abilities. If you would
like to join the cost is £2 for the
whole year. Please contact any of
