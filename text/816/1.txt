NUS protest over loans
On Wednesday the National Union
of Students (NUS) organised a
natinal day of action to protest
against the Government's proposed
student loans. In London the action
included a picket outside the
Department of Education and
Science that led to several arrests
and pickets of all the major NUS
London colleges. This was due to
include the total occupation of the
London School of Economics by
students
The culmination of the London
NUS action was a mass
demonstration organised against
central London branches of the
major banks who will be financing
loans. Some 500 students queued
up en-mass, disrupting the flow of
normal business, to hand in
prepared letters. The letters,
produced by the NUS, outlined the
major effects that the introduction
of Joans would have on students
and urged the banks not to do the
Government's 'dirty work' for.
them.
The NUS estimate that the
introduction of loans coupled with
the freezing of grants and the loss
of benefits, including Housing
Benefit and Income Support, will
mean that the average student will
be £500 worse off each year. This
year's first years are expected to be
facing loans of about £300 in their
final year.
The action comes in the wake of
several motions to the University of
London Union at the last General
Union Council (GUC). The motions
called for days of action over the
Government's proposals on student
loans, and its survey on affiliation
to the NUS.
Staff member 'squatting' in student flat
An administrative mistake has
allowed a member of the College's
research staff to remain unnoticed
in student accommodation for three
years. As a sitting tenant,
Biotechnology Research Assistant,
Carlos Flores is now refusing to
vacate his College Head Tenancy
Rat in Gerrard Mansions, after
taking legal advice.
Mr Flores signed a one year
contract for the flat in 1986. He
claims that, after his contract
expired, he remained in residence
whilst the College continued to bill
him for rent. This, Mr Hores claims,
constituted an extension of the
tenancy agreement, allowing him to
claim sitting tenant rights when the
College asked him to leave earlier
this year.
College Accommodation Officer
Loretto O'Callaghan told FELIX that
she 'smelt a rat' when she started
her job last year, and wrote to Mr
Flores requesting him to leave his
flat. She claimed it was ridiculous
for Mr Flores to claim that her
request was illegal and added 'He's
behaving very badly.' Ms
O'Calllaghan admits that the
College would now require a court
order to evict Mr Flores, who she
describes as 'a squatter.' The court
costs would not, however be
financially viable. Senior Assistant
Finance Officer, Malcolm Aldridge,
told FELIX that such a court case,
would only be a 'Pyrrhic victory.'
The Head Tenancy flats in
Gerrard St, Soho are unfurnished
and require students to supply floor
coverings, and furniture. Mr Flores
claims that he has decorated and
furnished his flat and feels that one
year contracts in such properties are
unfair. Ms O'Callaghan countered
that one year contracts are used to
prevent tenants gaining sitting
tenants' rights.
The College now intends to
continue billing Mr Flores with a
'Mesne rent. Such a rent is set for
bills alone and does not recognise
the payer as having any legal rights
of tenancy. Ms O'Callaghan
summed up by saying 'He's not
wanted here because he's
squatting.'

Chemistry
Explosion
'blown-up'
A Chemistry student was injured on
Wednesday when a glass flask
exploded in his face. Fellow
students contacted the emergency
services, who, in a move described
and 'wisely cautious' by College
Security Chief Geoff Reeves, called
the police, ambulance service and
several fire engines. The student,
who was fully conscious
throughout, was reported as being
'embarrassed' by the incident.
