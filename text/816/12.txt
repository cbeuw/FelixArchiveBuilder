Good Results
IC 3rd XI-3
Kent 3rd XI-0
IC 3rd XI^l
Kodak lis—2
Last Wednesday saw the 3rd XI's
first taste of UAU hockey against
Kent. Reinforced by three 2nd XI
players the game started well with
the ball continuously in the
opposition's half. The pressure
remained fruitless, however, until
Dave Millard opened the scoring on
the stroke of half-time. IC piled on
the pressure in the second half
leading to a second goal from Jon
Briggs who managed to net the ball
despite being taken out by the
keeper. Five minutes later Dave
Millard produced a carbon copy of
his first goal rounding off a good
team performance and UAU
success.
Following on from Wednesday's
game, the 3rd XI arrived in a good
spirit eager to take the game to the
opposition. Play soon became
scrappy, however, as reckless play
from the opposition marred the
atmosphere as IC took the lead
twice through Steven Burton only
to see two sloppy equalisers go past
Shaun West. Play improved to see
Steve Burton complete another
thrilling hat-trick and Kaleem
opening his account with the 3rd XI.
SKIING
Dry Slope
Racing
Last Saturday the Ski Club again
entered three teams for the second
match in the dry slope league. The
first team had a relatively easy first
round and won their group. The
second team managed to beat the
UCL first team (thanks to a faller)
but were then beaten in a thrilling
finish by someone running down
the slope carrying one ski! This led
to a second round clash between the
IC first and second teams, which
was surprisingly close but the result
was predictable. In the final playoffs
the first team were again beaten by
Harlow, the team which is so far
unbeaten. The second team faced
UCL firsts again, but this time UCL
stayed upright and won. Meanwhile
the third team won a race in each of
the first and second rounds but
despite this they came
disappointingly low in the placings
The final results were 2nd, 6th and
13th. Thanks to everyone who
came, especially Tudor for driving

Division 6
IC VI—2
LSE V - 3
In a game closely contested as the
score suggests, IC came twice from
behind to level the score before LSE
won the game with a lucky goal. Lee
Davis scored with a remarkable
header, despite the attentions of two
6ft defenders and despite Lee being
the shortest man on the pitch. Nigel
Sale scored the second with a 20
yard drive from the edge of the box.

Match Report
IC II—3
Kent II—2
After a string of good results, IC II
faced perhaps their toughest
challenge yet. The game started
badly for IC, but despite a lot of
early pressure IC managed to steal
an early goal through Ash Jalan.
Kent struck back with two quick
goals and IC were looking fragile—
but skipper Jezz Holland came to
the rescue with a well taken goal just
before half-time to bring the scores
level.
The second half kicked off and
both sides were going all out for the
win, despite many long balls and
much frantic play, IC broke away
and a foul tackle on Rakesh Muthoo
resulted in an Ed Coates penalty
and an IC lead.
Resolute defending in the final
minutes gave IC the win and special
mention should go to Russ Dark for
a particularly bad challenge and
booking and thanks also to Rakesh
for a broken leg (and crutches).

A very good performance from all
our teams with the sabroeurs
beating Surrey 9-0 but losing to Kent
6-3. The foilists lost one fight all day
and won 8-1 and 9-0 against Surrey
and Kent respectively. This
performance was especially good
since the team is very different from
last year. In the epee (our strongest
weapon) we won 8-1 and 9-0
The ladies managed to win both
their matches despite tough
opposition with the outcome
hinging on the last fight each time.
Both the men and ladies are through
to the third round.
GOLF
First Win
IC—3% points
Kent 2Va points
On Wednesday 9, IC Golf Team
played its first match of this year's
UAU Championship against Kent
University. Half the team was lost
at the end of last year so a new team
had to be constructed around this
year's intake. We were somewhat
unsure of the possible outcome, but
a good team spirit exists. Sound
performances from Alex Reilly,
Boon Wee Kuah and Rhys Evans
paved the way to a quite convincing
win,,if not evident by the final score.

UAU Thriller
IC 1
—
3
Kent 1-3
A late surge by IC saw them
overhaul a two goal deficit in the last
five minutes to salvage a vital draw,
Tim Sanchez-Fisher scoring in the
last minute of the match.
IC, unbeaten so far this season
started confidently, wasting several
chances only to go a goal behind.
Behind for the first time this season,
IC rallied and top scorer Brian Wood
rifled home the equaliser on the half
hour.
The second half saw Kent out in
bullish mood, dominating
territorially for long periods and
soon in a commanding two goal
lead. With ten minutes to play all
seemed lost, but a goal mouth
scramble and a Guy Hattersley cross
for Sanchez-Fisher, saw IC saving
the match in the dying seconds,
sending the fans wild.
RUGBY
Dominant
IC 1st XV-60
Kent University 1st—0
IC went into this, their third UAU
match, unbeaten and perhaps over
confident of victory in the initial
stages. It was obvious to all the team
that if they were to progress further
in the later stages, then this game
should be seen as an opportunity to
develop the dominant, controlled
rugby demonstration in earlier
games.
The first twenty minutes of the
game were generally scrappy and
undistinguished, the only points
worthy of note being two
opportunist tries from Dave
Fleming, capitalising on a weak
Kent defence. Although the level of
IC play picked up towards half-time,
things were not as easy as expected,
and IC were disappointed with the
score of 16-0 at the turnaround.
An animated half-time pep talk by
Henry produced immediate results.
The backs started to paly as
everyone knew they could, strong
in the tackle and devastating in
attack. The pack dominated in the
loose and in the set, scrums and
lineouts proving particularly fruitful.
Both forwards and backs showed
superb handling skills as a torrent
of tries demoralised the entire Kent
team. Dave Fleming completed his
hat trick and Jez Quirk returned to
his devastating best, smashing
through tackles to lay on tries for
others and score three himself.
Captain Jean-Francois Lucan bagged
a couple as IC ran riot.
