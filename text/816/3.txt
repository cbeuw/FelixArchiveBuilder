Felix
E d i t o r i a l On the Union Rat who sickn'd in the time of his
vagrancy being evited from Fulham.
Here lies poor Norman, Death hath broke his girt,
And here alas, hath laid him in the dirt.
Poor Norman found, like all of us, he couldn't pay the rent,
Despite the Massive top-up loan his money was soon spent.
With tear on cheek he packed some cheese into his little sack,
And moved into the office of a friendly IC hack,
whose name was Wendy Morris. Norman loved him dear.
But of the two, it's rumoured, the Rat could drink more beer.
Two blissful months the rodent spent as quadrapedal hack,
Until he supped at the Union Bar—supped and never came back,
Inside his baked potato dwelt a many-legged worm
Packed bursting full of toxins which ended Norman's term.
If you're in peril at IC, just look around and soon you'll see
An ectoplasmic rat appear to comfort and to seccour thee,
But be warned: if you try to hassle his friends,
Norman makes house-calls to seek his revenge.

A message from the other side
Dear Bill,
Hello! I thought I'd just drop you a note from Heaven. Wish you were
here—the weather's lovely and the food's even better. We exported all the
third rate manna to Moses and his gang to tide them over in the desert,
but now it looks as if the Union Food Bar needs some help too.
While I was still an earthly rat hanging out at the hack bar, my attention
was drawn to an excited group of foreign students. They were pointing
at an object in their chilli not dissimilar to a rat turd (not one of mine!)
and asking if it was part of the staple IC diet. Close inspection with a 400mm
camera revealed that the turd was in fact a caterpillar, a photograph of which
can be seen displayed on Union President Nigel Baker's door. Nigel thought
the photograph had been doctored, but as any sensible rat knows, caterpillar
season ends in September. Poor old Nigel.
Being an ex-rat has its advantages such as access to any room in College.
Deputy President Chas Brereton, it seems, lives in a filofax. His unused
examination paper is filed under 'unused examination paper' and his
passport is filed under 'passport'. He sleeps filed under 'bed' but oddly
enough there is no 'Interesting Things I Do' file. Norman the ex-Union
rat wishes him well in the City.
Recently I visited Chas in his office, not choosing to be seen. He was
busy sharpening pencils and stapling bits of paper together when Malcolm
Aldridge burst into his office.
'Here, Chas, sign this!', he said nervously, covering the small print with
his hand.
'I'm too busy sharpening pencils and stapling bits of paper together,'
said Chas, interestingly.
Having lost the element of surprise Malcolm returned to his office where
he deleted the 'Selling All Union Members Into Slavery' clause, before
persuading one of the other sabbaticals to sign the agreement.
One human I can really relate to is Rob Northey, since some of my
relatives also tried to leave a sinking ship. Rob, never to be outdone, turned
this cliche on its head and actually tried to board a sinking ship! Due to
his love/hate (emphasis on the latter) relationship with the Rector's wife,
Northey applied to RHBNC. Then someone told him it was going to merge
with IC. You can run, Rob, but you can't hide.
Well, it's almost time for my massage. Some people seem to think that
an eternity in paradise would be boring. I assure you that it is not, especially
with zany folks like Sydney Harbour-Bridge (brain changed in aid of Comic
Relief) to keep us amused. Here is Sydney's latest whacky idea.
'Let's build a brand new print unit above the FELIX Office.'
Yes, Sydney, but let's not forget that thefloorwould collapse under the
weight leaving the unit in the FELIX Office.
I look forward to seeing you all up here in about sixty years.
Lots of love,
Norman (the ex-Union Rat).
