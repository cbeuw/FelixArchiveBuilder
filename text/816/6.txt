THE
NIGHTS
SCHEDULE
Tickets £3.50 in advance - £4.00 on the door
Tonight
One of the highlights of Rag Week
has to be the Carnival, when the
whole of the Union Building is taken
over for an enormous party. Two
bands have been booked—Dumpy's
Rusty Nuts supported by Bad
Influence. Dumpy's Rusty Nuts were
formed in 1981, regularly headline
at the Marquee Club and have
supported Hawkwind, the Blues
Band, Venom and Motorhead—
playing at the Hammersmith Odeon
4 times. The band's music is a cross
between R + B and Heavy Metal,
with a slight touch of ZZ Top-ness.
Dumpy has a great sense of humour
which guarantees that his
performances are fun, and he has a
dedicated following throughout the
country.
As well as the bands we'll also be
showing a couple of films (Snow
White for all those Walt Disney
fanatics and Barbarella—a raunchy
60's comedy), and there will be
videos all night including Splash and
Running Scared. There's a bar
extension until 2am, the Ents Disco
will be playing until 3 and of course
cocktails (thanks to Links) and
Burgers from the Motor Club. How
much is it all going to cost?? Just
£3.50 in advance or £4 on the door
tonight. Tickets are available from
the Guilds office, ICU, the Rag
Committee or on the door don't
miss it!!
