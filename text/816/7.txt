Feature
The Beatles
FELIX
catches up
with the
latest pop
sensation
It would be hard to call the Beatles
anything but the greatest rock band
the world has and will ever see.
Love them, hate them, there is no
doubt that the talent of the group
was immense. And yet, their history
is more colourful than your average
teeny-bopper fad today.
The group were formed in 1959,
' with a five man line up; John
Lennon, Paul McCartney, George
Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe (bass) and
Pete Best (drums), under the name
'Johnny and the Quarrymen'. This
name was change to the 'Silver
Beatles' (inspired by Buddy Holly's
Crickets) and finally shortened to
'The Beatles'. The band first started
playing gigs in seedy night clubs in
Hamburg, Germany. However, the
band, with the exception of
Sutcliffe, wanted to come back to
England and were signed up by
Brian Epstein as their manager.
Epstein tried to get them signed up
with a major record company, but
astonishingly found complete
apathy (one company, Decca,
rejected them in favour of Brian
Poole and the Tremeloes).
However, one minor company
Partophone, headed by George
Martin, agreed to sign them up on
the condition that the drummer,
Best, was replaced. Reluctantly,
they agreed to this, and Harrison
recruited a friend, Ringo Starr.
The group's first single, Love Me
Do, was released in October 1962,
did moderately well, the follow-up
Please Please Me, was an enormous
success along with the similarly
titled debut album. Beatle-mania
had arrived.
From this point to their break-up
in 1970 all kinds of feats were
achieved, too numerous to mention
here. Their highpoint was in 1964,
when the Beatles were occupying
the top five positions of the US
singles chart along with another
seven records in the US top one
hundred. Event the top two US
albums were by the Beatles!
This success opened the
floodgates for British groups to the
US market, especially Liverpudlian
groups like Gerry and the
Pacemakers, which all played the
'Merseybeat'. Even the Rolling
Stones would attribute their break
into stardom to Lennon and
McCartney, with the successful
cover version of the song I Wanna Be
Your Man.
For the eight years of the band's
existence, the style of music went
through some dramatic changes.
This is best seen in their album
releases. Their first four albums;
Please Please Me, With the Beatles, A
Hard Day's Night, Beatles for Sale
showed the large influence from
stars like Chuck Berry, Everley
Brothers and Carl Perkins. Album
three and five (Help) were
soundtracks to the first two films
that the group made. However, by
number six, Rubber Soul, they had
mellowed into a more original and
distinctive approach without
becoming commercialised. Now
came a distinctive change in style as
album number seven showed.
which was based on characters in
previous Beatle songs; The White
Album; and the immortal song, Hey
Jude, an anthem to Lennon's son,
Julian.
1969 was the final year of official
activities. The film Let it Be was
started, but soon abandoned when
each Beatle didn't want to work
with the other. Their final classic
album, Abbey Road, showed the
world that it was all over. Paul
McCartney told the world that he
was leaving, on Friday 10 April
1970. McCartney was known for his
dislike of Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono.
He had also disagreed with the
appointment of new manager, Alan
Klein. McCartney officially made
sure the Beatles were dead on
January 19 1971, when rumours of
a possible replacement for him were
circulated and Klein, with producer
Phil Spector, finished and compiled
the film Let it be, so he was granted
a 'statement of motion'.
Since then, the 'ex-Beatles' have
Revolver was the beginning of the
group's psychedelic phase. This was
attributed to the group's retirement
from touring, hence more studio
work and experimentation. With
this increased leisure time, they
turned to drugs, especially
hallucinogenic LSD and were also
fascinated by Indian culture. After
seven months in the studio, the
finest concept album of all time was
released in June 1967 Sergeant
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. This
masterpiece was marred, however,
by the early death of their manager,
Brian Epstein, From here, the future
of the Beatles looked bleak. Indeed
their TV movie Magical Mystery Tour
was severely criticised by the press.
Also, Lennon and McCartney were
now fighting bitterly, and even
dragged Harris and Starr into the
battle.
Despite the setbacks, the final two
years saw legendary material being
produced; the film Yellow Submarine,
all undertaken solo projects, though
not without controversy. Ringo
Starr has had the lowest profile of
all with a few cover versions of
songs, but a string of disastrous
movies, though one That'll Be The
Day did stand out. The other three
all enjoyed enormous success with
at least one two million selling 45"
single each. Without doubt, the
saddest aspect of the breakup will
be the knowledge that Lennon and
McCartney never settled their
dispute and never will be able to.
IC Radio presents a one hour
show of Beatles and Beatles-related
material every Tuesday lunchtime at
lpm. In addition, there is now a
survey to find out IC students'
favourite three Beatles tracks, film,
album and member of the band.
Your top three singles will go to
make a top twenty to be played at
the end of the Christmas term.
Watch out for your surveyor!
Epilogue
Picture your average U . C . C . A
candidate in a few years time. He
wants a good science degree from
a reputable university.
Academically, Imperial is top of
the list. He then asks himself, 'can
I afford it ?.'
With the increase in rents, the
prospect of poll tax and higher
costs of living alongside a frozen
student grant and a loan system
which is far from attractive is he
not more likely to sacrifice the
academic edge Imperial has and
opt for a slightly lower standard
of University in a more
financially-survivable region?
We are reaching the stage
where the economic disadvantage
of a degree course at Imperial is
outweighing the academic
advantage.
If Imperial is to retain its unique
reputation as a leading centre of
Science and Technology it is
surely in its interests to attack the
top brains from across the
country, not the brains from one
small sector of the population
who's financial standing enables
them to apply.
COMPETITION
A farmer owns a circular field. In
'this field he wants to put a goat.
Bordering the field is a fence, to
which the goat will be tied with a
rope. The farmer wants the goat to
eat only a quarter of the grass in the
field.
The question is, how long should
the rope be?
(The field has a radius of twenty
metres, and you can assume that the
j goat can eat the grass before it has
ia chance to grow.)
Entries should be submitted to the
!FELIX Office by Wednesday 12.30.
The answer most nearly correct will
be awarded a Â£10 book token. In the
event of a tie the winner will be
drawn from the editors silly hat.
