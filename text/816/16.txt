UGC report may force
merger with RHBNC
The Physics and Chemistry
Departments at Royal Holloway and
Bedford New College (RHBNC)
may be forced to merge to avoid
closure.
A report published by the
University Grants Committee on
Thursday has blacklisted RHBNC as
one of a list of universities whose
Physics and Chemistry
Departments have 'fewer than 20
staff or 200 students on full-time
honours courses'.
The report stresses that small
departments are not educationally
viable. It claims that 'the subjects
will emerge stronger from
concentrating staff and students into
fewer universities'.
The report's objective is not to
increase already large departments
such as those at IC but to 'maximise
the number of viable departments'.
The UGC report gives affected
universities three choices. The first
is to build up their departments,
something RHBNC is financially
incapable of doing. Alternatively,
they can merge departments within
their universities, with two
departments receiving the funding
equivalent of one. The final choice
is to 'enter into a consortium with
neighbouring universities'.
Professors in the Chemistry
Departments at RHBNC view the
last option with most optimism.
In an interview with the 'Herald
and News' RHBNC College
Secretary, John Laureys, said that
he was not expecting to have to
close the Physics and Chemistry
Departments but pointed out that a
merger with Imperial College was
being investigated.
Bikes
napped
IC Students' bicycles were removed
from outside the Physics
department by Scotland Yard at the
weekend as a precaution against
terrorist activity over Sunday's
Rememberance Ceremony in the
Albert Hall.
Locks provided by the College's
security department were removed
with a pneumatic drill in the move
made after a bike with its frame
stuffed with explosives blew up
several years ago.
The bicycles have now been
returned to their owners with the
police force paying for the
replacement of locks.
Careers
demo
Imperial College's Third World First
and Campaign Against the Arms
Trade groups staged a
demonstration, outside the careers
fair this week, against companies
recruiting for defense work.
They cite eight companies as
'major arms traders' which include
avionics and aerospace companies
as the Ministry of Defence.
'Students are unaware of the
extent of the arms trade with the
Third World', claimed a spokesman.
And finally...
The Rector, Professor Eric Ash, was
detained at Indian customs on his
tour of the Far East recently when
he was unable to produce an entry
visa at Delhi. Professor Ash and his
wife were allowed passage after
intervention by the British Consul.
Sources in the Electrical
Engineering Dept. have revealed
that the incident was a considerable
embarrassment. A spokesperson in
College said that it was up to the
Rector himself to organise his
passport.
The trip included many south-east
Asian countries and was intended
to aid IC's foreign relations.
Professor Ash returned from the
tour last Sunday.
International congress
to be held at IC
Imperial College is to host the
second International Scientists'
Congress in December, entitled
'Ways Out of the Arms Race.'
The Congress will see world
experts on subjects including
Nuclear Arms, Chemical Warfare
and the 'Star Wars' project.
Speakers include Robert McNamara
(US Secretary of Defense 1968-81)
and Professor Roald Sagdeev, the
Chairman of the 'Committee of
Soviet Scientists for Peace against
the Nuclear Threat'. Professor
Sagdeev is said to be one of Mr
Gorbachev's top men in the Kremlin
at present.
Dr John Hassard, the organiser of
the event, explained that scientists
have not been sufficently involved
in political decisions on arms control
which are based on their
technology. The first Congress in
Hamburg in 1986 was organised in
recognition of this, he added.
Dr Hassard has been promised
coverage by BBC Radio 4 and
Channel 4 television. He also hopes
for an international satellite link at
the first Session, on Friday
December 2nd, between Britain, the
USSR and West Germany. He went
on to say that he is keen to see 'as
much student participation as
possible.' Students interested in
attending the event on December 2,
3 and 4 should contact Mr Hassard
on internal 6780. The cost to
students will be £15, including a
reception and food over the
weekend.
