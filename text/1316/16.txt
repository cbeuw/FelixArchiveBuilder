CLUB REVIEW
So much has been said and written
about this place, it’s hard to know
where to begin without telling you
what you already know or boring
you. I’ll try not to. The bottom line
with Fabric is that, on most nights,
a few minutes after arriving at cold,
drizzly Charterhouse Street, you can
step in and all of a sudden find your-
self surrounded by fantastic music
and a very large, energetic, noisy
crowd. A few metres underneath the
bleak streets of nocturnal London,
there is one hell of a party going on.
Tonight we were here to see
Digweed, a DJ from way back when
who’s played a part in shaping the
club music and lifestyle we have
today. He truly is a legend. Unlike
some other high profile jocks, he
hasn’t lost his edge or his skill.
Check out his recent mix, Fabric 20
(see review in Felix 1312), and you’ll
see what I mean.
The night and CD release were
probably timed to coincide, but this
was always going to be a big night
due to Digweed’s status. Lucky, then,
that my group all avoided the scarily
large queue and went straight in.
Even luckier that we were allowed
into the VIP area (the balcony over
room one) and luckier still that one
of my friends had decided to pay for
us to have our own exclusive table in
said VIP area. When Fabric gets this
full, there is often nowhere to chill,
but we had a nice area with a sofa,
and the music still sounded great
from there.
Preceding Digweed was Pete
Moss, whose Strive to Live is, inci-
dentally, track one on Fabric 20.
Moss set the scene perfectly for
the big man, with smooth yet driv-
ing tunes and the occasional bit
of bouncy bass-led fun. When we
first arrived the crowd was already
pumped, cheering and screaming to
the breakdowns, and the dancefloor
in room one was pretty packed.
At 2am, the break in the music
and the almost deafening roar of
the crowd signified Mr D’s arrival
in the booth. The atmosphere was
electric with anticipation; everyone
had been waiting for this, and we
were all ready.
Digweed began his set with low-
intensity, dreamy-sounding tracks,
and the noise died down as everyone
got back to what they came here to
do: dance. We spent the night flitting
between our table, the dancefloor
and the stairs: the floor being very
crowded, the table being too far from
the action and the stairs, as ever,
being a great place to sit amongst
some randoms, have a smoke and
watch endless streams of people
walk up and down past you.
One way or another, we were
locked into Digweed’s sound all
night. When you go and hear a prog
DJ, its very easy to get lost in the
music and just be carried by it. This
was exactly what happened. The
style of the music really precludes
tune-spotting, but it was bloody
amazing all night.
The sounds this guy finds and the
way he presents them results in
a beautiful layered progression of
sounds, each one grabbing a differ-
ent part of you. Delicious. To add
to the fun, as everyone (including
Digweed himself) says, the sound
system in Fabric is divine and per-
fectly suited to this kind of music.
Basslines are warm and envelop you
wherever you are in the room, the
midrange is punchy and slaps you
round the face, and the highs spin
around the room above your head.
Fabric closes officially at 7am, but
they have a 24 hour licence (you can
see it when you queue for the cloak-
room) and Digweed played on. God
knows how long for; we were partied
out and left shortly after.
Please, take my advice: there’s
no question of whether or not you
should see Digweed, the question
is when.

Sub Red @ Imperial College Union
PREVIEW
ICU’s popular drum and bass night,
Sub Red, is back this Friday, 18
Februrary with guest DJ Bryan Gee
and the Union’s own MacPherson,
as well as IC Radio’s Spindle and
Chug.
It’s halfway through term, so if
you’re anything like me, the purse
strings will already be tightening.
Don’t despair though, since ICU is
once again bringing you another
top night of drum and bass DJs and
cheap drinks.
Sub Red is one of the best nights
held at the Union, previously attract-
ing such famous names as Nicky
Blackmarket and Ray Keith. At the
top of the bill this time is Bryan
Gee, accompanied by MacPherson
(the Union’s Venue Manager, who
can also be seen playing at super-
club Fabric). Spindle and Chug
made a name for themselves with
their Basement Sessions show on
IC Radio and are now taking dance-
floors by storm.
Bryan Gee is a key figure in the
drum and bass scene. Through the
label V Recordings, he and Jumpin’
Jack Frost have been releasing
material by a whole string of big
names, including Roni Size, DJ Die,
Ray Keith and DJ Marky & XRS to
name a few.
As if that wasn’t enough to whet
your appetite, there’s also an offer
on drinks: vodka with mixer is only
£1. Once the dancefloor is full of
weary students working off the
week’s worries, the turbosound PA
is pumping and the light show is in
full effect, dBs can easily rival any
venue of it’s size.
The DJs, the sound and lights and
the (cheap) bar are all there. All
that’s missing is the vibe, and that’s
down to you. Come along, have some
fun and make some noise!
Just before you groan: “Urgh,
but it’s the Union,” take a moment
to reflect on what’s on offer here:
an impressive line-up of first class,
professional DJs, cheap entry
(try getting into any halfway
decent club in London on a Friday
for less than a tenner) and cheap
drinks, all in the comfort and famil-
iar surroundings of your very own
Union.
Felix will be down there to check
out the action: look out for a review
next week. So get yourself down to
the Union this Friday, and you might
just get yourself in the paper!

Atomic Mass
No, not in a physics way. In a full-
on-party-in-a-church way. Honest
CLUB REVIEW
The venue of a club is one of the most
important factors for me in choosing
a night out. Some are tiny, friendly,
and intimate. Others are vast arenas
with towering speaker stacks and
screaming crowds of thousands that
are easy to lose yourself in. Many
are converted theatres with balco-
nies providing amazing panoramas
of the rave scene below.
Mass providesthemostinteresting
venue of all: it is situated in a church.
Now, I’ve seen the conversion of dis-
used churches into venues to great
effect (speakers hanging from stone
pillars, walls adorned with memorial
plaques), but the difference here is
that the home of Mass, St Matthew’s
Church in Brixton, is still in full and
active use.
Let me explain a little more. St
Matthews is really quite a huge, rela-
tively modern building that is divid-
ed into many different regions and
rooms, some of which are used for
religious worship, others for enter-
tainment (the Bug Bar is also here,
in the crypt). Lucky, really:meet-
ing the congregation on the way
home from Saturday night’s frolics
wouldn’t really be my perfect end to
a party.
Atomic Energy is one of those
nights that is held with vague regu-
larity: there’s about one every three
months. It’s the kind of party that
people make the effort to get to, and
tonight was Atomic Energy’s sixth
birthday. With three rooms, but only
two DJ line ups, the flyer promised
‘London’s Finest Hardbeat Energy
in Two Rooms’ from the likes of
Captain Tinrib, Kevin Energy and
Group 185, as well as a third room
of ‘Psychadelic Energy’. Energy all
round, then.
The Mass has three rooms, two
of which are on the same level and
and the third is far below, down a
long spiral staircase. At the bottom
and top of this staircase is where
you enter and where you’ll find the
cloakroom and toilets respectively.
The top two rooms were home to the
crisscrossed main line-up, whilst the
psy was downstairs, which is also
known as ‘3rd Base’.
The music tonight, as you might
have guessed, was fast, hard and
bouncy. I’m not sure who I saw and
when, but it was all very, very good.
The place wasn’t ram jammed, but
it was pretty full in the upstairs
rooms. The bigger of the two had a
kind of upper section, with a lowered
dancefloor in the middle in front of
which was the stage. The sounds
here were twisted and fast, with a
very nice acidic edge. When I was
here there were some crazy dread-
locked cybers on stage providing the
sounds.
In the other upstairs room, I saw
Captain Tinrib, genius of the Tinrib
label. Those with a penchant for
hard house should know the name:
it’s synonymous with fast but fun
pumping music. You might think this
sort of thing is all drum rolls and
hoover noises, and whilst those are
important elements, there’s a lot
more in store for your ears if you’re
willing to listen for a bit. Appearing
on stage with a live percussionist,
the Captain was awesome.
Downstairs in the psy room, there
weren’t really many people at any
point. This was fine though, since
it leaves lots of room for flailing
around the floor. Maybe the music
wasn’t as intense and driving as I
like, but it was still, as the flyer had
suggested, full of energy.
This was really quite a good night
out, aside from the 5000 flyers I was
loaded up with on our way out.
