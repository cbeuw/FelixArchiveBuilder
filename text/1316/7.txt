The most popular searches on
Google in 2004 have been published,
and the results show that women are
lacking in certain departments...
The global top ten searches for
2004 can tell us a lot about our-
selves, ranging from what we think
to what we want to know. Here is the
list, as given on the BBC website,
rating the searches starting at the
most popular: Britney Spears, Paris
Hilton, Christina Aguilera, Pamela
Anderson, Chat, Games, Carmen
Electra, Orlando Bloom, Harry
Potter, mp3.
You will note that the top seven
are clearly guys looking for naughty
pictures of ladies, chat rooms to
talk naughtily to ladies or games to
waste time.
Orlando Bloom is the only entry
that may be due to ladies searching.
The problem with this being that
this statistic is entirely due to me – I
have a bit of an elf thing.
But wait, I hear you cry, these are
the global results, surely us Brits
are much better than this! Well,
yes we are. In the UK top searches
of 2004, there was one noticeable
difference: in at number two was
‘income tax returns’. This means
that we are the same as the rest of
the world who all want to see pleas-
ures of the flesh, except we have a
slight accounting fetish too.
Rather oddly, in the French ver-
sion, the third most popular search
was ‘France’. Trying to find your-
selves on the map, eh?
Those nice Google types even split
the results up into many smaller
lists covering many different areas,
for instance the ‘popular tech stuff’
has as its top searches: Wallpaper,
Kazaa, mp3, Spybot, Linux.
Since when is home decoration
‘tech stuff’? There is a good con-
nection here though – people get
Kazaa, many of them will down-
load mp3s from it, they realise they
have gallons of spyware, try to get
rid of it using Spybot, and then even-
tually get so annoyed they install
Linux. I can’t think of any imme-
diately obvious way to get from
Britney to mp3 in a similar fashion
though.
As for the top ten searches con-
ducted at Imperial College, sadly
I could not get my hands on this
valuable data, but I’m willing to bet
money that ‘pi to 27 decimal places’
is the most searched-for thing.
So what can we learn from this?
Girls: there are lots of pictures
of pretty men on the internet (I
recommend searching for ‘fellatio
fajitas’ in Google). Guys: there’s
more on the internet than pretty
ladies (I recommend ‘fellatio fajitas’
again).
In conclusion, there is a lot of
wasted web space out there.
None more wasted than www.

Seeing as there is no point in advo-
cating Mac OS X to a die hard
Windows user, even if it is better,
more stable and prettier, I thought
I’d write the partisan’s guide.
Mac OS X
Well you see this is easy. Whilst the
cost for Apple hardware may initial-
ly be higher (in some rare cases),
Mac OS X is the company’s real
cost-cutter. You see, the long term
cost of a Mac is considerably lower
than that of a PC. Why, you ask?
Well, a Mac doesn’t crash. A Mac
doesn’t have viruses (at present).
A Mac doesn’t have spy-ware. But,
more importantly, it looks prettier
and works better. The assumption
that it is a ‘my first OS’ is rub-
bish too. If you want to tinker, it is
far more customisable and malle-
able than Windows, due to its UNIX
core.
Applescripts allow you to auto-
mate virtually anything, and with
system-wide services allowing pro-
grams to use anything from spell-
checks to image import, you can
make things as easy or as tricky as
you want, all without breaking the
damn thing. Plus it doesn’t have
random interfaces – all programs
are standardised.
But if you’re looking for the real
killer, for every delay that Microsoft
announce for Longhorn (wasn’t
that meant to arrive in 1983?),
Apple introduce another OS ver-
sion that incorporates features
from Longhorn 2. Plus Apple doesn’t
suck as much as Microsoft. They
don’t decide randomly to make their
web-browser non-standards com-
pliant. And they don’t smell. But
frankly the best thing about Apple is
that their CEO has a sense of style
and is so amazing he’s managed
to beat cancer without taking off
his trademark turtleneck (suck that,
Gates).
Windows
Windows eh? That’s the rubbish
garbage that comes with your PC
right? The thing you have to con-
tinually re-install if you hope to get
any sort of performance out of it?
That’s the one.
The good thing is, though, that
for some reason this doesn’t affect
gaming. In fact, it seems to posi-
tively encourage it – why else would
anyone buy a £2000 PC with flashing
lights and demon head monitor?
Windows isn’t for family newslet-
ters (Charles Manson excepted) or
for light email browsing. It’s mostly
not even for video editing or pro-use.
That’s what Macs are for. Gaming is
the raison d’etre for PCs nowadays.
And Windows is the base system
of choice. As far as I can work out,
that’s because it’s cheap. Possibly.
Market dominance might have
something to do with it as well, but I
reckon it’s because most people are
stupid and lazy.
Linux
I don’t actually know much about
linux, except that it’s free. And it’s
loved by server-type people. And
people who don’t like sunlight.
Apparently stable, and getting some
very good apps (most of which run
on Mac via X11), maybe Linux is the
way of the future for the completely
addicted to tinkering. Or those who
feel niche computing is the way of
the future and dislike svelte well-
designed systems. Or those who like
flagellating themselves.
By the way, I use OS X, and it’s
great.

Dear Fit Biology Guy,
I am terribly sorry that the bland-
ness you revealed after our outing
to Starbucks has been relegated to
a tale to be told in the pub just the
once, and never again.
Stormy.
I can’t write that in an email. No
way. It’s so ungracious, especially
since he’d asked to be mentioned in
my fantastic column and bought me
coffee to have his prowess written all
over this page. Unfortunately, Miss
Woods does not do shallow, unless
it’s a more luxurious kind of shallow,
where a completely hideous chap
with a lovely personality and hotshot
job buys me a Tiffany solitaire with
a box of Godiva chocolates before
getting down on one knee. My mate-
rialism is substantiated in a belief,
propagated by countless aunties,
that ‘when money gets tight, love
flies out of the window’.
I digress. Biology guy talked about
fair trade, domestic products and
his E-number intolerance during an
hour of bravado and rhetorical ego-
tistical pandering. Not once did I get
a word in about myself. Not once did
he ask about me! Hmph.
Anyway, more fascinating things
beckon. Like the night of passion
I enjoyed in the presence of not
one but two of the most physically
perfect men I’ve ever met in my
life! What made it sweeter was the
fact that they chose the inimitable
Stormy over the group of girls I
despise the most – those blubbery,
self-absorbed gothic types, who
automatically dislike any girl more
articulate and accomplished than
them. Not all gothic females offend
me – it’s just the pretension and the
bitchiness I can’t tolerate, especially
from the kind who feel that wearing
outrageous synthetic hair is a good
idea in their attempts to distract
male attention away from a visage
that a blind mother couldn’t love and
an inch of clown make-up couldn’t
disguise!
Post-Camberwell warehouse party
(where fire was juggled by guy one
and atmospheric breakbeat techno
was spun by guy two), I realised
that getting back to Hammersmith
from this post-modern squat (remi-
niscent of the one seen in South
West 9, complete with sculptures,
resident spiritual healer and visiting
drug dealer) at 2am was going to
be a mission. So I invited the most
fascinating, well-travelled chaps to
walk me to the bus stop.
Guy number one, Travis Fimmel
lookalike replete with the most stun-
ning foam mohawk, asked me for my
number so we could meet up again. I
told him I’d only see him if I could see
guy number two (an infinitely more
interesting, snowboarding, younger
version of Jonathan Davis before he
got fat) at the same time. He agreed,
on the condition I snogged him right
then and there. Never one to shirk
an opportunity, I entered a steamy
clinch, first with Mohawk, and then
his friend. Before we knew it, we
were back at mine, after wanting,
wishing, waiting and thinking of get-
ting down to business.
Technically speaking, first base
was good. Mohawk held my body
firmly and gave the finest firm body
massage I’d ever had! His kisses
were strong, but not sloppy, and
his oral anatomy knowledge was
superb. Excellent. Unlike his floppy-
tongued puppy of a mate, he knew
how to have a good time, and it was
on the strength of this that I let him
go further. It was here that I learnt
lesson number one, for the ten mil-
lionth time:
‘Good looking guys do not have to
try to keep girls interested. Hence,
they’ve not got the time to devel-
op their personalities, or bedroom
techniques, because they’ve rarely
got a break from girls.’
His breast technique required fur-
ther practise – a lesson with the les-
bians was just what he needed. The
kitten approach, mixed with knead-
ing movements, does not serve to
please. Breasts are not like penises,
boys – take good care not to tear
them off!
Going south of the waist wasn’t
worth trying in the fear of that expe-
rience being equally dismal, so,
without further ado, I skipped over
to his uglier mate in the hope that
the ‘ugly men make better lovers’
theory might have held true. I was
wrong. Nine times out of ten, I have
better sex on my own.
We had an interesting take on the
Rockbitch board game (based on
the Ann Summers one), before I
ended up winning the golden con-
dom and getting him to do whatever
I wanted! ‘Whatever’ ended up being
‘anything’, and ‘anything’ ended up
being the most beautiful body mas-
sage a girl could dream of!
Massage over and done with, we
ended up going through the trau-
ma of Korn-man being unable to
make himself stand to attention.
Repeatedly. It got boring after the
fifth time, and my politesse could
only extend to a limited period of
time. In impatience, whilst knowing
this not to be a reflection on myself,
I bid him and his friend goodbye,
and went off, in true Imperial style,
to make love with the only reliable,
true and technically perfect person
who could deliver the goods every
single time. Myself.
