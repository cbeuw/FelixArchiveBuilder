Silwood Park correspondent
Last Tuesday saw the intense
Union sabbatical elec-
tion campaign pay a visit
to Silwood Park, the small-
est outlying campus of the
Imperial world. Around 30
people, many of whom were
potential student representa-
tives, arrived to attend our
termly union meeting, con-
tributing to a turnout not seen
at Silwood in many years.
The meeting was well
underway when the two
minibuses arrived and people
started emerging and stretch-
ing off the miles. Having then
navigated their way through
the maze that is the new card
access system, they polite-
ly sat at the back, listening
intently to the issues we have,
being so detached from what
often seems like the rest of
the world, let alone Imperial
College.
Once there was a timely
pause, Sam Rorke apologised
for being late with stories of
how they got lost four times.
This was rather ironic as
we have been trying to tell
College how remote we are
and how this remoteness is
a contributing factor to many
issues Silwood Park students
have with their lives while
studying here.
It was when the debates
moved towards the catering
on site and, more important-
ly, residences that the candi-
dates at the back found their
voices and used the presence
of the current Union president
Mustafa Arif as an opportu-
nity to put forward their way
of thinking if they were to be
voted into office for the next
year. One candidate pointed
out that campuses such as
Silwood and Wye, although
much smaller than South
Kensington, could potential-
ly be very influential in the
elections if a low turnout was
experienced elsewhere.
Much debate was had over
rent increases (Silwood hav-
ing seen a 21% increase over
the last two years), inclusion
of the telephone and inter-
net into accommodation bills
with no opt-out available,
and notice to quit deadlines
meaning a student leaving
mid-term could potentially be
landed with a bill for many
thousands of pounds. I per-
sonally find it hard to see how
the last two issues are in the
best interest of the students.
They could easily be seen as
a way of guaranteeing a cer-
tain amount of income from
accommodation.
Following the closing of the
meeting, candidates were led
past the Union notice boards
where, sellotape and blu tack
in hand, they were officially
allowed to place their post-
ers. Posters appeared in
every colour of the rainbow
(and then some more), some
with pictures from bad hair
days, and some personalised
for Silwood (a nice touch).
Unfortunately, rules had to
be bent at this point, as we
were told that each candidate
had to place their posters at
least 6m apart - an interest-
ing dilemma when the total
length of the one Union noti-
ceboard on site is 4.23m.
With the closing of the
meeting, the job of raising our
issues well done, and elec-
tion material duly placed, the
group then retreated to the
bar, the centre of Silwood life
as those biology and engineer-
ing students due to come out
here in a few months will see.
It’s a cosy abode for many,
with a wooden bar and newly
polished tables.
The campaigning here
started with the handing out
of flyers, promises of how
things should and would be
changed, and personalised
tins of beans. This was fol-
lowed by discussion amongst
the residents, who pulled
themselves away from the
Chinese New Year and pan-
cake celebrations, about how
Silwoodians, and more gener-
ally postgraduates, could be
better represented.
Some good ideas were put
forward. I was impressed by
those who made an effort to
put up posters and come and
talk to me, but disappointed
by the turning down of my
offer to vote for anyone who
brought me a pint from eve-
ryone bar Sam Rorke, who
isn’t even running for any-
thing. Many later redeemed
themselves by opting not
to go home early and stay
for the second minibus at
11. They drank with us and
conversation stayed vaguely
related to the Union but did
deviate more and more with
increased flow of beer.
All in all we had a good
night – it was nice to be rec-
ognised by the Union, and
we are always happy to have
them out here. Here’s to the
hope that Silwoodians and
postgraduates can continue
the advances made over this
last year.
