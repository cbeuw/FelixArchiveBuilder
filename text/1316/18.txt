Have you seen the bright pink, some
have called them garish pink, post-
ers up around college? You know,
the ones with the dog that encour-
age you to bring a friend? Reading
anything up on the walkway can
be a bit of a hit and miss affair,
especially when you’re trying to get
somewhere, so let us fill in the gaps
and tell you about this year’s arts
festival.
We all know that we attend an art
student-free college; we have a rep-
utation for being nerds and science
geeks. Some of that reputation is
probably richly deserved and treas-
ured by some parties, but we are
not lacking in creativity! The arts
festival exists to showcase the wide
range of artistic talent throughout
the college.
Cleverly branded ‘Arts Fest 2005’,
this year’s arts festival kicks off on
Sunday 20 February and will end
with a grand finale on the follow-
ing Friday. Over 15 societies are
taking part this year, ranging from
Leosoc to Capoeira and everything
in between. Events are taking place
throughout the week and most are
free.
The festival kicks off on Sunday
with the medics’ fashion show at the
renowned Sketch on Conduit Street.
(If you messed up Valentine’s Day,
this could be a good chance to make
amends. The venue is regularly
voted one of the most romantic in
town.) The show starts at 6.30pm.
Throughout the week, there
will be an exhibition in the Blyth
gallery, on the fifth floor of the
Sherfield building, and perform-
ances of Chess by Musical Theatre
Society in the Union Concert Hall in
Beit Quad.
The exhibition will officially open at
6.30pm on Monday 21 February, with
a concert by the Chamber Music
Society in the Read lecture theatre,
also on the fifth floor of Sherfield.
The concert, like the exhibition,
which will be showcasing work by
Leosoc and the Photography and
Origami societies, is free.
Chess [see Clubs and Societies,
page 11] is a ticketed event, £4.50
for students. For those of you not
familiar with the musical, its story is
based around a love triangle caught
up in the world chess champion-
ships between Russia and the United
States. It premiered in May 1986,
and is the work of lyricist Tim Rice
with music by Benny Andersson and
Bjorn Ulvaeus.
Other events taking place during
the week include an origami ses-
sion on Monday lunchtime in the
JCR. The Urban Music society will
be hosting a Heavy Elements night
that will feature live DJs and MCs
from 8pm Monday in dBs.
If none of this is to your taste,
there is still a lot on offer that will
hopefully satisfy you. On Tuesday
evening, dBs will be the venue for
a Jazz and Rock gig night, and on
Thursday it will welcome the ever-
popular Big Band.
Wednesday will be a very busy day.
The Dance Extravaganza will come
to the JCR from 2 until 5.30pm. Those
keen to take part will be glad to
know that the Dance Extravaganza
will be your chance to try out capoe-
ira, breakdancing, hip hop, latin and
more dance styles for free. In the
evening, there will be a short con-
cert in the Great Hall given by the
Choir, Symphony Orchestra and Big
Band. The concert is free, but you
will be asked to make a donation to
the Tsunami Relief Fund.
The festival wraps up on Friday
with the Finale concert in the Great
Hall at 7.30pm, with an after party
at the Union. Tickets, £2.50 for stu-
dents, will be available throughout
the week at the ticket desk on the
walkway level of Sherfield. The con-
cert will be the final glittering show-
case of the wide breadth of artistic
talent at the college. The after party
is free for those with a concert tick-
et and will feature Fabriclive’s Joe
Ransom and £1 pints. You can suffer
for your art, but there’s no need to
be thirsty!
More information on the events
taking place during Arts Fest 2005 is
available on the website www.union.

societies taking part in the festival,
you have to be really apathetic not
to get involved.

Excessively cheesy billboards lurid-
ly display a grinning Patrick Stewart
and an equally beaming Joshua
Jackson, as if these famous faces
were the greatest enticements of
the play, A Life in the Theatre, cur-
rently running at the Apollo in the
West End.
Admittedly, my interest in seeing
the play was, shamefully, fuelled by
the thought of being in the same
room, indeed within 10 metres of,
Joshua Jackson, star of the embar-
rassingly addictive television show
Dawson’s Creek, which I avidly
watched throughout my teenage
years. Patrick Stewart, eternally
associated with Star Trek and his
role as Jean-Luc Picard, also held a
degree of pulling power. It looked as
though the theatre had picked a win-
ner: something for every (wo)man.
But who even cares what the play
is about?
In case some people are interest-
ed in what these famous faces are
up to on stage each night, the play
is, in brief, a study of theatre life,
depicted through Robert (Stewart)
and John (Jackson), old and young
actors working together in a middle-
of-the-road theatre company.
It’s obvious that neither is going
to make it big, but while John is at
the beginning of his career, aspiring
to greatness, Robert has spent his
life in the theatre. Despite his lack
of success, Robert obviously feels
his life could not have been spent
elsewhere, and as his career wanes
still further, he takes to dispens-
ing advice to his young protégé in
the hope of revealing the inherent
pitfalls and soul-destroying tasks of
such a life.
Initially, John is reverent in his
attention to his superior’s words,
but slowly he gains confidence and
loses faith in Robert, grasping for
the upper hand and belittling the
older man as it becomes clear he
is not the mover and the shaker he
purports to be.
All this sounds a little dry and
perhaps more suited for an audi-
ence of theatre professionals better
equipped to ‘get’ the insider jokes
and references. However, the play-
wright David Mamet, himself an
actor in his youth, attempts to steer
clear of falling into that niche and
presents a play which is very acces-
sible and often very funny.
Patrick Stewart masterfully por-
trays Robert’s construed self-impor-
tance, and Joshua Jackson functions
well as a cushion off which Robert’s
inconsequential advice and rambled
proclamations bounce and tumble.
The play consists of short scenes
of the two actors performing togeth-
er and then returning backstage to
their tiny shared dressing room to
dissect the state of affairs. The ‘on-
stage’ scenes are often very funny,
with neither ‘actor’ exhibiting much
skill.
As the play progresses, Robert
loses grip on himself, perform-
ing more comically and becoming
wracked with an amusing self-doubt.
John gains in confidence, though
not in skill, and revels in villifying
the older man.
Couched in all this humour is a
touching tale of the shifting dynam-
ics between these two men at dif-
ferent stages of their lives. One
exits the theatre a little moved and
perhaps more enlightened over the
plight of the many men and women
in theatres up and down the country
and beyond.
Patrick Stewart and Joshua
Jackson, the undisputable draws of
the play, do deliver. Both show them-
selves to be surprisingly competent
comic actors and do their best to
give some returns on the ticket’s
hefty price-tag.
However, despite a running time
of less than 90 minutes, this per-
formance drags. While chuckles are
freely given and deserved, there is
not enough meat in the play to prop-
erly satisfy. While Mamet does avoid
creating a play with no relevance for
the general public, he does not suc-
ceed in creating a play that is fully
gratifying for this public. By the end,
the jokes elicit, at best, a smirk. One
begins to lose compassion for the
fumbling Robert, and even Joshua
Jackson in his underpants fails to
retain one’s attention.
In short, Patrick Stewart and
Joshua Jackson are indeed the
greatest attractions of this produc-
tion. It is just a shame that they
were not provided with better mate-
rial with which to dazzle us once we
had bitten the bait.
