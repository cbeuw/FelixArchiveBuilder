A musical... about chess? How
does that work? The answer
is: “Very well!”
Musical theatre gets a hard
time of it. It’s often seen as
cheesy, corny and clichéd. A
street full of people suddenly
burst into song and start to
walk in time, singing loudly
in harmony before swinging
round lamp posts. Or tough
street gangs in New York skip
lightly into a ballet sequence
as they fight each other. Plots
are predictable as bad guy
turns good, falls in love with
the unobtainable glamorous
girl, wins her heart, and they
both live happily ever after.
But it’s not all like that.
Last month, the BBC tel-
evised the recent West End
smash hit Jerry Springer
The Opera to much contro-
versy. There was nothing
corny or clichéd about that.
It was inventive, exciting new
music built around an origi-
nal, humorous plot parody-
ing some of the extremes of
today’s society.
Although West End thea-
tres are enjoying a revival
and box offices are grossing
millions for classics like Les
Miserables, The Phantom of
the Opera and Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang, people still don’t
see musical theatre as a ‘seri-
ous’ art form.
But that needn’t be the
case.
Musical theatre very often
tackles ideas and topics that
other art forms wouldn’t dare
to touch. This is illustrated in
the current West End show
The Producers, where two
producers set out to try to
make a musical about Hitler,
in the hope that it will fail.
In some cases, musical
theatre succeeds because
of the very blatant suspen-
sion of reality that it provides.
When you see a chorus of Ku
Klux Klan members tap danc-
ing (Jerry Springer), Nazis
soldiers singing and dancing
gaily (The Producers), or a
man-eating plant singing like
the king of soul (Little Shop
of Horrors) this somehow
makes the unacceptable or
unbelievable palatable.
However, on a more serious
level, the beauty of song and
dance is that they can con-
nect directly into the brains
of the audience and commu-
nicate with them in a way that
isn’t possible within the con-
straints of language alone.
Musical theatre can be like
watching opera, dance and
drama rolled into one. Often,
watching someone sing and
dance a role can be far more
affecting than just watching
them act it – provided that the
music and choreography are
both strong.
For every corny, cheesy and
clichéd musical out there,
there is another touching,
beautiful and poignant work
too. So much musical theatre
is never seen by the mass
audience, because of the com-
mercial nature of the art. The
West End is dominated by
Lloyd Webber and a handful
of shows based on the back-
catalogue of famous pop/rock
bands.
But you don’t have to go to
the West End.
Next week, for one week
only, the Imperial College
Union Musical Theatre
Society will be producing
Chess. The musical was writ-
ten by Benny Andersson,
Bjorn Ulvaeus and Tim Rice,
running in the West End in
1985 and on Broadway in
1989.
The action takes place
against the backdrop of the
Cold War in the early 1980s
and follows the East versus
West story on a number of
different levels. On the sur-
face, we see the World Chess
Championship taking place
between the American and
Russian Grandmasters
(Freddie and Anatoly). Things
become complicated, though,
when a love story unfolds
between Florence (American)
and Anatoly (Russian).
Furthermore, we learn about
goings-on in Florence’s past
involvingherfatherduringthe
Hungarian Uprising of 1956.
As part-Hungarian, Florence
still feels resentful towards
Russia for its involvement
in this episode. This leads to
some underhand diplomacy
by American and Russian
agents. The three stories are
closely interwoven, and the
story of chess becomes an
allegory to link them all.
Chess is an emotional,
diplomatic and sporting bat-
tle, which sees loyalties and
friendships stretched to the
limit. It is an incredible work
of musical theatre: with a
solid, complex and twisting
storyline woven around very
deep and interesting charac-
ters, it fuses together a wide
variety of musical styles from
orchestral to choral, rock to
pop.
Cheesy, corny and clichéd it
is not. But if you want a night
of real musical theatre, with
a fascinating plot, intrigu-
ing characters and beautiful
music, come to see Chess.

MUSICAL THEATRE
SOCIETY
A musical about chess?
Last year’s MTSoc production, Little Shop Of Horrors
By Cristina Rodríguez
Trobajo
Think about all those won-
derful things that only hap-
pen once a year. Christmas:
25 December. Your birthday:
(read as appropriate). End
of the College year: 24 June.
Picocon: 19 February.
For those of you puzzled
by this last event, let me tell
you what I’m talking about.
Picocon is the one-day con-
vention run by Imperial
College Science Fiction,
Fantasy and Horror Society
(ICSF for short) at the Union
in Beit Quad. It is smaller
than most conventions (ours
only lasts 10 hours), but don’t
be deceived by its size: a long-
lasting tradition of success is
backing us up.
Picocon is in its 22nd year,
reaching the respectable age
when the event is older than
some of the people organis-
ing it. If you are still unsure
about what Picocon is, you
probably ought to come find
out for yourself. I can tell you
it is a fun day, filled with dis-
cussions, games, stalls and
all sorts of randomness you
will appreciate.
This year, we will enjoy the
presence of three greats of
British science fiction and
fantasy as our guests.
Gwyneth Jones is a writer
and critic of science fiction
(also known as Ann Halam,
writer of teenage horror fic-
tion) and one of our returning
authors. She won the 2002
Arthur C Clarke award for
her novel Bold As Love, and
her novel Life has been nomi-
nated for the 2004 Philip K
Dick award.
Jon Courtenay Grimwood
is well known in SF cir-
cles as the author of the
Arabesk trilogy (Pashazade,
Effendi and Felaheen, which
have won several awards,
including the Arthur C
Clarke for Pashazade).
His latest novel, Stamping
Butterflies, has been nom-
inated for the 2004 British
Science Fiction Association
awards.
Brian Stableford is the
proof that we treat our
guests very well, as this will
be his fourth Picocon. He
has been publishing books
for almost 40 years, writing
over 50 novels and almost
200 short stories, as well as
many non-fiction titles. Two
of his collections of short sto-
ries, Asgard’s Secrets and
Sheena and Other Gothic
Tales, are about to go to
press.
Picocon 22 will open its
doors at 10am, with the
absence of a fish duel. At 11,
the events will begin in the
Union Dining Hall (UDH),
with a welcome speech from
Simon, the ICSF ChairEntity,
and a talk from Gwyneth
Jones on the topic of insan-
ity.
Afterwards, we will have
a lunch break of an hour
and a half, during which
the Destruction of Dodgy
Merchandise(DoDM)auction
will take place: those really
tacky pieces of merchandise
tagging along after every
single film and TV series
made today will be up for
sale, with all proceeds going
to RAG. If you win the auc-
tion, you can keep the piece,
or, if you truly dislike it and
wish to destroy it, we will have
liquid nitrogen and heavy
blunt instruments available
for your enjoyment.
At 1.30pm, Jon Courtenay
Grimwood will hold a Q&A
session, followed at 2.30 by
a talk by Brian Stableford on
the myth of the Space Age.
At 3.30, all our guest speak-
ers will take part in a panel
discussion.
At 4.30 there will be an
hour of silly games. You all
know them: Just a Minute,
Mornington Crescent... and,
if you don’t, you should come
and learn!
Finally, to round up the
day, there’s The Quiz at 6.00.
Picocon will close its doors
at 7pm, without a fish duel,
of course.
As if this wasn’t enough,
during the whole day there
will be wargames, LAN
gaming, capture the hat,
a scavenger hunt, book
stalls, lots of insanity and
good fun.
You don’t need to be a mem-
ber to come. You don’t even
need to be into sci-fi. Come
for the talks, the games,
the Destruction of Dodgy
Merchandise, the people, the
heck of it, or the absence of a
fish duel. But come.
Picocon 22 will take place
on Saturday 19 February in
the Union Building, from
10am to 7pm. Entrance fees
are £7 for normal entrance /
£5 concessions / £3 for mem-
bers of ICSF. See you there!
