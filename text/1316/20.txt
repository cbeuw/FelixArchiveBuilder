Terminal illness movies always set
out to be life-affirming, but few actu-
ally earn their uplifting conclusions
as this Spanish biopic does.
The film is the fact-based story of
Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem),
a virile seaman who was severely
injured in a diving accident in the
late sixties and bedridden thereaf-
ter, unable to move from the neck
down. He has a poet’s soul and is
deeply sensitive, yet he has allowed
himself to become bitter over his
situation. He is convinced that “a
life in this condition has no dignity”
and battles the courts for the right to
kill himself.
Since the accident, he has lived in
his family’s house, with his quietly
brooding father Joaquin, his grumpy
older brother José, his anxious sis-
ter-in-law Manuela, and their slight-
ly dim-witted teenage son Javier.
José considers it his duty to pro-
vide for his incapacitated brother,
and Manuela cares for him with a
devotion tinged by hints of romantic
affection; Javier, meanwhile, looks
upon his uncle as a second father.
Ramón has no dignity in the current
arrangement, no zest for life. He
wants to die.
Through the help of a group called
Death with Dignity, he secures the
services of Julia (Belén Rueda),
a lawyer herself suffering from a
degenerative disease, to prepare for
his court presentation. The notoriety
the case achieves attracts the notice
of Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single
mother who comes to visit him, and
a quadriplegic priest, who comes to
the house to dissuade Ramon from
his goal. This is given a humorous
touch by the presence of a couple
of hapless seminarians, who must
carry their messages up and down
the stairs of the family house.
Ultimately, this isn’t a film about
death, but about life. Tortured
by missing the freedom he once
enjoyed, Ramón is plagued by visions
of his past. It’s here that director
Amenábar excels. His direction is
graceful throughout, but never more
so than in one beautiful scene where
Ramón imagines swooping out of his
bedroom window, soaring over the
Spanish countryside and landing on
a beach where Julia is waiting to kiss
him, all accompanied by Puccini’s
Nessun Dorma. The poignant story
subtly reminds us how fortunate we
are to be able to choose life.
Thanks to sensitive writing by
Amenábar, a truly remarkable per-
formance from Bardem and excel-
lent support from the rest of the
cast, the picture rises above its
generic roots to emerge as a power-
ful human drama.
It’s entirely credible that Ramón
should be the focus of romantic
attraction (and understated rivalry)
on the part of all three women in
his life, who, in the excellently var-
ied performances of Rueda, Duenas
and Rivera, effectively represent the
different possible reactions toward
Ramón’s desire to die. What makes
The Sea Inside such a riveting
drama is that none of these relation-
ships is sufficient to make Ramón
want to go on living. It is probably
the most uplifting, life-affirming film
about suicide ever made. He’s such
a wonderful, honest man that you
really hope he dies at the end.
The Sea Inside takes on a topical
issue, and gives no answers except
that which is entirely specific to
Ramón:thismanhasclearlyweighed
up life and death carefully and cho-
sen the latter. Valid arguments are
presented against his choice – his
family, who adore him, don’t want
to lose him, and a priest notes that
“life isn’t just moving your arms and
running around.” But Ramón hasn’t
taken this decision lightly. At night,
he weeps, asking himself: “Why do I
want to die?”
This is one man’s story, told with
great empathy, and Amenábar
deserves great credit for lifting the
film above the tacky, clichéd soap
opera sentimentality into which it
could have easily fallen. I took two
extremely cynical friends to see it
with me and we all were incredibly
moved. Like Ramón in his dreams,
The Sea Inside often soars.

Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
After five years on Nickelodeon,
Spongebob Squarepants makes his
way from the bottom of the ocean
to the big screen. So how exactly do
you keep the viewers entertained for
90 minutes? The least you could do
is give it an interesting plot!
For those who are unfamiliar with
Spongebob, he is a yellow sponge
who wears square pants and
lives in a community called Bikini
Bottom, in a pineapple under the
sea. Spongebob and his best friend
Patrick (a starfish) are completely
optimistic, cheerful and light-heart-
ed. This merriness is crushed when
Spongebob doesn’t get the manage-
rial position at the new Krusty Krab
hamburger restaurant because he
is a ‘kid’, despite the fact that his
dedication has won him hundreds
of ‘employee of the month’ awards
in the past.
Meanwhile, in a place not too far
away from the Krusty Krab restau-
rant, lies the tiny evil genius that is
Plankton. Plankton’s intentions are
to steal the secret formula of the
Krab’s hamburger and subsequent-
ly rule the world. Having tried all
his evil plans (stored in an evil plan
drawer) from A to Y, he loses hope
of world domination. However, his
spirits are raised when his (make-
believe) computer wife reminds him
that there is an extra letter in the
alphabet – Z! In fact, not only does
Plankton find plan Z, but he also
finds it to be ‘evil, diabolic and lemon
scented’.
The plan goes extremely well. Mr
Krabs is framed for stealing King
Neptune’s crown (the main pur-
pose of which is to cover the King’s
shiny bald head). Plankton steals
the secret formula to Krab’s ham-
burger and offers a bucket helmet
with every purchase. Eventually
Spongebob and Patrick go on a mis-
sion to retrieve the stolen crown in
order to save Mr Krab’s life, stop
Bikini Bottom from being taken over
by Plankton and prove that they are
men, not kids. To do this, they have
to go to Shell City, from where no-
one ever returns.
The movie, together with its obvi-
ously intelligent and complicated
plot, also had lessons of self accept-
ance and self respect. This is where
the reader should toss their head
backwards and laugh. It was a pain-
fully extended version of a 30 minute
television programme. It is cartoon-
ish enough for students to tolerate,
and it does have occasional funny
moments. However, if you do actu-
ally laugh, you should be ashamed
of yourself.
The movie would probably be great
for major fans, especially kids, since
it has the inspirational ‘it’s okay to
be a kid’ message. But it won’t win
over many other people. As for the
songs, they weren’t catchy or even
tuneful. Horrible is all I can say.
Nothing is really witty, except per-
haps the ‘lemon scented’ tag line.
The rest is just plain craziness.
If you’re looking for humour along
the lines of Finding Nemo, this won’t
get you there at all. The movie is
completely colourful with creatures
of all sorts and has too many sense-
less messages. It was pretty disap-
pointing, and they should have stuck
with television.
