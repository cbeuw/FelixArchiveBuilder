Coffee Break elections FUCWITs
1. Bono
He’s singlehandedly saved the world,
many many times over. What’s his
real name though?
3. Mr T
He was once ‘The World’s Hardest
Bouncer’. For real. What was the
name of the character he played in
Rocky?
5. Action Man
He might be made of plastic but he’s
hard as nails. Do you know when he
was ‘born’? It was either 1942, 1966
or 1983.
2. The Hoff
Two words: Knight Rider. One man,
several hundred satisfied ladies, and
one gay car. The question is, what
does KITT stand for?
4. Homer Simpson
He’s the dad you always wished you
had. When Homer had his snow
plough business, what was his
name?
6. Ellen MacArthur
She sailed a boat, all the way around
the world. Apparently, that’s some
achievement. What was the name of
her boat?
7. Kate Moss
She’s a mum now, so maybe it’s time
for her to grow up. How old was Kate
when she was first discovered?
9. Dr Evil
Holding the world to ransom makes
you a villain in our book. We want
to know, what was the name of his
cat?
11. Barney The Dinosaur
There’s something not quite right
about this... thing. Complete the lyr-
ics of his evil chant: “with a great big
hug and a kiss from me to you...”
8. Usher
Usher’s made some of the worst
songs ever – he’s shit. True or false,
he recently signed up to promote his
own credit card scheme?
10. Robbie Savage
If you know football, you won’t like
this guy. How many red cards has he
picked up across his career?
12. Michael Jackson
Did you see that snazzy white suit
he wore to court? Apparently it used
to be black. Can you name Jacko’s
most successful album?

Our main quiz this week is Heroes
and Villains, which is just a simple
test of your general knowledge.
On the left we have six heroes, and
on the right are six villains. They’ve
each got a question associated with
them, and you just have to answer.
It’s pretty easy really.
There’s two points for each cor-
rect answer.
They all have their own reasons
for being good or bad, and if you
disagree, feel free to email us and
complain. But we think our choices
are pretty fair.
In case you’ve had your head buried in the sand for the past week or two,
it’s been the sabbatical elections at the Union recently. Apparently, it’s very
important or whatever. But not as important as this: we need a mascot for
Coffee Break.
Last year they had PowerSheep, this year we’ve had nothing. It’s time for
a change! One solution, revolution! We’ve got three candidates for the role,
all legends in their own respect, but only one who truly deserves it.

1. Stephen Hawking
He’s the smart choice,
but he works at
Cambridge. Will that
count against him?
2. The Hoff
He’s getting pretty
regular here now, so
would you like to see
him every week?
3. Georgie Thompson
One for the lads here,
the Sky Sports News
presenter makes even
relegation sound sweet.
