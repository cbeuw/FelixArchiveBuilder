The Spanish archer (El Bow – dumped)
Since we’ve just had Valentine’s Day
and there’s a lot of love in the air, I
thought we could change the mood
this week by offering you all a few
tips on how to dump someone with-
out hurting them too much. We have
all been there, got together with
someone, and for the first few weeks
it’s great but then you notice a few
bad habits creeping in... the next
thing you know, you never want to be
near the person again!
We’ve all had do it at some stage
in our lives, or we have all been on
the end of a dumping. I was dumped
once after 45 minutes! Mind you, I
was only 12 at the time. I was also
once given the elbow while shopping
in Sainsbury’s – that was extremely
painful!
In all seriousness though, it’s
not fun and it’s always important
to remember how your actions will
affect the other person. I suppose
there is no easy way of doing some-
thing like this, though it is always
good to give the other person some
respect. The rest of the article will
hopefully help you to consider your
actions and make the process that
little bit easier.
Not all relationships are meant
to be. And it’s much better to admit
that it’s run its course than try to
squeeze out every last drop. If you’ve
decided to call it a day then play fair
and let your partner down honestly
but gently. A definite goodbye will
hurt, but it will be easier all round
if you are clear that the relationship
is over.
Give some thought to how you are
going to end the relationship. There
are right ways and wrong ways and,
although you may no longer care for
the other person, don’t humiliate or
embarrass them. You liked them
once and they deserve better. Think
how you would like to be treated if
the situation was reversed. You can-
not be sure how they will react, and
it may not be pretty, but knowing
that you dealt with it decently will
mean you won’t be dwelling on your
bad behaviour later on.
Some choose to end a relationship
by text message or email. Before
doing this, imagine how you would
feel if somebody let you down in this
way. It’s difficult to break bad news
but there is less confusion and upset
if you give the other person a chance
to air their thoughts back to you
rather than delivering a one-way
message. You don’t have to get into a
post-relationship analysis, and don’t
let them talk you round if you’re sure
finishing is the best thing, but face-
to-face or over the phone shows a
little more guts and respect.
If you opt to end it to their face,
then do consider where you’ll do it.
A public place may not be the best
option if you think the other person
is going to start crying or creating
a scene; although if you are scared
that they will take it very badly then
you may feel safer with other people
around.
It can be confusing if the per-
son you thought you were seeing
has simply stopped contacting you.
The hardest thing about this kind
of break-up is not knowing what’s
going on. If your partner has qui-
etly skulked off then you may end up
making excuses for them. Don’t kid
yourself that because you haven’t
verbally split up, your relationship
must still be OK. Be brave, pick up
the phone and find out what’s going
on for sure. You don’t deserve to be
ignored! If the news is bad, at least
you know where you stand and can
move on. Asking or not asking them
is not going to change the way they
feel about you, while avoiding this
conversation is only delaying any
heartache.
The end of a relationship can leave
you feeling miserable, even if you
were the one doing the dumping.
Being dumped is never nice, and
if you are the one on the end of a
dumping it can often make you feel
rejected and depressed.
If these feelings continue and start
to affect your everyday life, espe-
cially in your studies or at work, it
may be a good idea to talk someone
about it. Here are some tips.
● Plenty more fish in the sea –
even though you are upset now, it is
important to remember that there
are other men and women out there
who are just as nice as the person
you have just had a relationship
with.
● Support network – if your partner
was your support in life then it’s
important to find alternative sup-
port. Look to friends and family, or if
this isn’t appropriate look for agen-
cies that can help.
● It’s not your fault – relationships
break down for all sorts of reasons.
You’ll soon find someone who suits
your personality more.
● Have a good time – see it as a
liberating experience, get stuck into
the things you enjoy, meet up with
friends and start to do the things
you stopped doing when you were in
a relationship.
● If it’s over it’s over – resist the
urge to ring up and contact your ex.
Let them do the chasing!

STUDENT ADVISER
One of the biggest political gambles
that I took during my time in office
was to force electronic voting onto
the agenda and push it through as
our principal method of polling. Of
course it went through due process
and there were plenty of very tedi-
ous naysayers who predicted that
online voting would result in lower
turnouts, more irregularities and,
generally, the end of the world as we
know it. This has not happened. In
fact, far from it.
Sure, there were difficulties with
our first electronic voting attempt
(last year’s sabbatical elections).
During the Council elections ear-
lier this year, things were still being
ironed out. There will always be
problems with the introduction of
any new system. Many problems are
avoidable through testing (and we
did this) but some just won’t appear
until you actually test ‘in the field’.
Now that we have a fair amount of
experience, as an organisation, of
running electronic voting, we are
much better at it and able to run it
very successfully.
It caused grief for lots of people
(mainly me, as that’s where anger
was directed) along the way, but ulti-
mately it was an investment that has
paid off. The motivation the whole
time was to improve the Union by
making it more representative of
the student body through higher
election turnouts. And that has now
been achieved.
In the Union’s Strategic Review
all-student survey last term, there
was an overwhelmingly positive
response to the introduction of elec-
tronic voting. And now, we have seen
the largest democratic exercise ever
held at Imperial College. At the time
of writing, over 2700 students have
voted in at least one of the sabbati-
cal elections. This is unprecedented.
The previous best was when I was
first elected with around 1400 vot-
ers, in a paper ballot. Turnout is
over 22%, the highest it’s ever been.
It doesn’t quite get up to the 27%
realised in the NUS Referendum
in 2002, however we had far less
students then. (One of the main
changes I made last year was to
extend full Union membership to
part time students, who have always
been less involved, which has made
a big difference to our membership.
Many PhD students, traditionally
uninvolved, are also registered as
part time students because they
are paid by the College to do their
research.)
No doubt some people will have
little niggles on one or two things
that could have been done better.
And yes, of course they could. There
is always room for improvement.
But let’s not take away from the
facts: many students who previously
would never have voted have done
so, and the Union is now in a much
stronger position to legitimately
represent students than at any time
in history.
And please, can Union hacks stop
the debate about electronic voting?
It’s definitely the right way to go.
Paper ballots are history. It’s time
to move on.
E-voting – end of story
STATE OF
THE UNION
MUSTAFA ARIF
UNION PRESIDENT
Monday was Valentine’s Day, that
annual festival of relentless choco-
lates, roses and nauseating greet-
ing cards. Inevitably, the day has
earned itself the reputation of being
the most romantic date in the cal-
endar, and many couples take the
opportunity to spend ‘quality time’
with each other. At this point, you’re
probably wondering why I’m writing
this drivel. There are a few rea-
sons.
Firstly, I’ve wanted a good excuse
to write a column entitled ‘The Joy
of Sex’ ever since I conceived the
title in October, and this seemed as
good a reason as any.
Secondly, it’s always worth re-iter-
ating the message of safe sex. Nigel
Cooke, the Union’s Student Adviser,
did a superb column on sexually
transmitted infections in Issue 1312
(check the archives online). It’s
worth adding that you can get advice
on sexual health from the college’s
Health Centre in Prince’s Gardens,
or pop down to the Information and
Advice Centre to pick up more infor-
mation.
Thirdly, I hope all you couples
out there had a lovely time on
Valentine’s Day. I didn’t. I was in the
office until 9pm, then went home
sad and lonely. The sabbatical life-
style, far from being glitzy and excit-
ing, is now beginning to take its toll
on my personal life. Last year, the
President (or someone acting on
his behalf) advertised for a first lady
in this organ. I have yet to decide
whether I will have to resort to this.
More important, perhaps, than
sex, is communication. In this sea-
son of elections, I have accompa-
nied the vote-hunting candidates to
places as far and wide as Silwood
and Wye, and one thing that became
clear from talking to students was
that good communication makes life
a lot easier.
Communication with the stu-
dent body is something we pull the
College up on, but we often fail in
it ourselves. It came as no surprise
that this was one of the Executive’s
key findings in the Strategic Review
document that will be presented to
Council, the Union’s governing body,
tonight.
What are we doing to improve
the situation? For feedback on our
commercial services, the Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
Sameena Misbahuddin, has started
the ‘Your Say’ initiative (check out
www.union.ic.ac.uk/yoursay). For
my own part, I am trying to manage
me emails better, and get on top of
my paperwork, partly with the help
of an extra member of administra-
tive staff.
The battle continues, and the situ-
ation is far from perfect; if I have let
you down by poor communication,
I would like to apologise by buying
you a pint (or a coffee, if you prefer)
and giving you some of my time. If
you have any suggestions of how we
can improve communication, please
email me on dpew@ic.ac.uk.
