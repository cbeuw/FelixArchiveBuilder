While Barclays Capital stuns investors with ‘massive’ profits and Deutsche Bank is left
confused about its asset management unit, Numaan Chaudhry sniggers
Barclays
Barclays’ 20% gain in net
profits was helped by strong
investment banking business
and a significant decrease in
provisions for bad loans.
Barclays’ Chief Executive
Officer, John Varley, also
attempted to lower expecta-
tions for future merger dis-
cussions, asserting that the
big British bank didn’t “need
to do anything”. Still, accord-
ing to one person familiar
with the bank, Mr Varley has
broached the idea of buying
US consumer finance compa-
nies and, on the flip side, the
bank is often mentioned as a
possible target for a large US
acquirer.
Mr Varley declined to com-
ment on specific speculation,
saying: “A takeover is really
the furthest thing from my
mind.”
Barclays said net profit
rose from £2.77bn in 2003
to £3.31bn in 2004, and that
its investment bank posted a
25% increase in profit from
2003.
Barclays also got a big boost
from a decrease in bad loan
provisions, which analysts do
not view as a sustainable way
to increase profit. Barclays
reported a 19% drop in 2004
provisions for bad debts to
£1.1bn from £1.3bn in 2003.
Still, those results mirrored
the actions taken by some US
banks in a sign of an improv-
ing economy.
Barclays’ shares slipped
0.08% to 593.5 pence in London
trading on Thursday.
Barclays’ UK retail bank
operations reported a
decrease of almost 1% in
profit from £1.14bn to £1.13bn.
One reason for this is the
bank’s increased spending
on employees’ salaries after
comparatively underpay-
ing them, according to ana-
lysts, and an effort to reno-
vate some branches. In 2004,
Barclays said it added 1000
employees who deal directly
with customers.
The percentage rate at
which the bank’s costs rose
also surprised analysts.
Operating expenses rose
15% from £7.25bn to £8.35bn.
Michael Lever, an analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston,
said analysts and investors
had expected costs to rise
13%.
While Barclays Capital,
the investment banking unit,
helped increase profit, it also
reported a 37% increase in
costs to £2.2bn in 2004. The
unit under CEO Bob Diamond
has been on an aggressive
push that included the addi-
tion of 2000 employees last
year in an effort to improve
its rankings in such areas as
European debt issuances.
Separately, Mr Diamond
said, there remains the possi-
bility that Barclays will settle
a court case with Germany’s
HSH Nordbank. HSH
has alleged that Barclays
deceived it in a derivatives
trade. A court hearing is
scheduled for later this
month.
Barclays has declined to
comment on the allegation
beyond saying that the losses
suffered by HSH were the
result of a sizable downturn
in the credit market.
Deutsche Bank
Deutsche Bank AG might be
looking to sell the UK divi-
sion of its global funds man-
agement arm as part of the
German bank’s shake-up of
its UK institutional business,
following big outflows last
year.
The company’s official posi-
tion is that it is considering all
options for the UK division of
Deutsche Asset Management.
However, Deutsche Bank
Chief Executive, Josef
Ackermann, said this month
that if the UK business can’t
be fixed, Deutsche Bank may
put it on the market.
Deutsche Asset Manage-
ment operates a number of
vehicles in the UK, with a
total of 78.5bn euros of assets
under management. Globally,
it has a total of £400bn (580bn
euros) under management,
and real-estate makes up
7.5% of these assets, accord-
ing to real-estate advisory
firm Cushman & Wakefield,
Healey & Baker.
A sale on this scale would be
a big deal for the UK market,
Andrew Thornton, joint man-
aging director for European
Real Estate at Invesco Real
Estate in London, said.
“Typically you would expect
the usual suspects – the
Morgan Stanleys and Merrill
Lynches of this world – to be
interested. Insurance com-
panies are also diversifying
more into asset management,
so the funds could also appeal
to them.” Mr Thornton said.
Deutsche Asset Manage-
ment has been hit by an out-
flow of funds, especially in
the 2004 fourth quarter, when
investors withdrew 20bn
euros, most of which came
from the UK.
Deutsche Asset Manage-
mentoutflowslastyeartotaled
44bn euros world-wide. While
the company declined to pro-
vide figures on a country-by-
country basis, a spokesper-
son said that the UK outflows
were “higher than normal.”
She declined to give further
details.
As a result of the outflows,
the German bank is conduct-
ing a review of its institutional
business in the UK and plans
to announce the outcome of
the review by the beginning of
the second quarter.
Kevin Parker, who became
the global head of asset man-
agement at Deutsche Asset
Management in December,
suggested the review of the
UK business. Deutsche Asset
Management also has offices
in 10 other European cities,
including Frankfurt, Zurich
and Paris; however, none of
these operations is under
review, a Deutsche Bank
spokeswoman said.
If Deutsche Bank does
decide to sell its UK asset-
management division, poten-
tial bidders might include
investment banks such as
Morgan Stanley and UK
life-insurance funds, Bryan
Laxton, head of advisory serv-
ices at Cushman & Wakefield,
Healy & Baker in London,
said.
“I don’t think investors
would object to the individual
vehicles being sold to another
high-profile company as long
as the team that managed
them,especiallythefundman-
agers, were part of the deal. It
would make more sense to
sell all the Deutsche Asset
Management vehicles as one
package, to take advantage of
the synergies, rather than to
sell the vehicles on an individ-
ual basis,” Mr Laxton said.
He noted that Deutsche
Bank might sell the funds
piecemeal if investors show
interest in snapping up vehi-
cles to complement their
existing funds.
Deutsche Bank is embark-
ing on a cost-cutting program
to meet its goal of raising its
return on equity to 25% by
the end of 2005, up from 17%
in 2004. The bank said this
month that it will cut 6,400
full-time jobs. However, 1,200
of these will be transferred
to lower-cost locations, result-
ing in a net reduction of 5,200
staff. The bank said expenses
related to the job cuts and
other efficiency measures are
expected to total about 1.3bn
euros for 2005 and the fourth
quarter of 2004.
The bank is also expected
to sell more real-estate assets
this year, following its drive
to dispose of these assets
in the past few years. In
December, it sold a portfolio
of 109 buildings in Germany to
Eurocastle Investment Ltd.,
an investment company man-
aged by US investor Fortress
Investment Group LLC, for
about 300m euros. The bank,
which occupies the major-
ity of the properties, plans to
lease back many of them.
Elsewhere in Europe, one
of the biggest real-estate
sales in German history is in
the final stages, according to
those who track the market.
German utility E.On AG’s
sale of its real-estate unit
Viterra, which owns about
150,000 apartments, is expect-
ed to be completed within
weeks as part of E.On’s drive
to focus on its energy busi-
ness and sell off non-core
assets. Real-estate advisers
estimate that E.On could
gain about 6bn euros from
the Viterra sale. Investor
Fortress Investment Group
LLC, which declined to com-
ment, is believed to be the
main contender. Other likely
potential buyers include US-
based investors Blackstone
Group and Cerberus Partners
and UK-based investor Terra
Firma Capital Partners Ltd.
US investor Lone Star, who
couldn’t be reached for com-
ment, is not thought to have
a bid.
Barclays Plc: doing extremely well and with strong prospects ahead
