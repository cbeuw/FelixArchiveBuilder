Hello friends, and thanks for tuning
in. Since no-one managed to send us
a correct solution to Jabberwock’s
lovely musical offering last week, I
thought I’d make things a bit easier
for you this time around. My cross-
words are always a bit nicer, right?
Not necessarily ‘simpler’, just ‘more
accessible’, that’s what I say.
Credit here should also go to
Captain Peaky for several of the
clues.
At this point, I should mention that
we need more people to compose
challenging cruciverbal conun-
drums for the pages of Felix. So if
you’d like to try your hand at writing
a crossword, cryptic or quick, let us
know at coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk.

Reading Men’s 1st 6
Imperial Men’s 1st 25
By David Jackson
“It was best of times, it was
the worst of times,” mused
Imperial’s First XV captain
Michael Hicks on the coach,
and whilst he was not antici-
pating a gory guillotining as
a member of the French aris-
tocracy, he too, like Sydney
Carton in that famous novel,
had worries. He knew that,
short of an enormous defeat
against Reading, Imperial
were assured of their second
league win in as many years.
However, with the Varsity
match looming large on the
horizon, he also knew that
any match practice was inval-
uable and so welcomed the
opportunity of a final, albeit
virtually meaningless, BUSA
match against Reading.
Imperial were buoyed by an
excellent and sociable coach
journey on one of the pre-
mier members of the Golden
Tellings fleet. They also
enjoyed an excellent warm-
up in the idyllic surround-
ings of Reading’s leafy and
female-dominated campus.
The Reading players, look-
ing resplendent in brand new
kits, were hoping to claim
a hefty scalp and cement
their team’s position as the
league’s second best team.
The game began and
Imperial were quick to rub-
ber stamp their mark on the
match,excitingthecrowdwith
the fast free-flowing rugby
which they have come to be
know for. After an exchange
of early penalties, Imperial
smoothly moved into a higher
gear and following a period
of pressure it was, inevitably,
Achi who powered through a
hapless defence to score the
first try.
The gasoline was continual-
ly supplied to Imperial’s rev-
ving engine, and the scoring
did not stop there. The ver-
satile James Pedder sniped
around the edge of ruck and
rounded off another superb
multi-phase move with a fine
try.
The best try of all was
scored by the enigmatic Jon
Spencer. He, Alex O’Rourke
and Gabriel showed magnifi-
cent hands on a swashbuck-
ling blind side move, with Jon
scoring superbly past a bewil-
dered and dizzied Reading
defence. The awe-struck
crowd, fully aware of the
skill they had just witnessed,
applauded loudly.
The second half was a some-
what messy affair, indeed in
patches it was as scrappy as
Scooby Doo’s minature side-
kick. Reading were far more
physical in the last half and
did their utmost to make it
difficult for Imperial. Their
defence was breached, how-
ever, as the impish Gabriel
(only the second shortest
man on the pitch) finished
another end-to-end move
in the corner. The Imperial
defence held firm and the
match ended four tries to nil
to Imperial. The team was
jubilant to have secured the
league and enjoyed the oppor-
tunity to practise some new
moves, with varying success.
Notable appearances were
made by captain Michael
Hicks and Gabriel, playing
in his preferred position of
full-back. Other appearances
were made by old maestro
Robinson, exciting young
Serbian sensation Jovan,
and by a young man whose
Imperial career is proving as
bright as the Blackpool illu-
minations he loves so much
– Steve.

Imperial Men’s 1st 18
UCL Men’s 1st 5
By Michael Hicks
After winning our league for
the second year running,
the Imperial College Union
Rugby Club First XV faced
UCL in the Gutteridge Cup
semi-finals. Having won the
tournament last year and
being in good form, we set
off confidently to our oppo-
sition’s ground. On arrival,
we found ourselves facing a
gale and some pretty heavy
rain. This, along with kick-off
being 20 minutes later than
planned, hampered our pre-
match preparation.
When we finally kicked off,
we came under some good
pressure from UCL and knew
we were in for a tough game.
Luckily, we woke up fairly
quickly and started playing
some good rugby. We got our
first reward after ten minutes
when good hands down the
line found Al Newman on the
wing. When he got wrapped
up, a great supporting run
from Steve McClellen allowed
him to take the ball on and
around their arriving cover
to score in the corner. Jon
Spencer then converted to
make it 7-0 to Imperial.
Unfortunately, UCL came
back quickly and a simple
overlap allowed them to score
out wide. They missed the
conversion into the wind and
the score was 7-5.
We then began to assert
ourselves and after some bro-
ken play close to the UCL
try line, Robinson drew the
defence, allowing Pedder to
dart through and touch down.
12-5.
In the second half there
were no more tries, but
instead plenty of penalties as
UCL
’s discipline very noticea-
bly started to slip. Man of the
match Jon Spencer kicked
superbly and added another
six points to our tally to make
it 18-5 after 80 minutes.
We now face our toughest
games of the season with the
annual varsity match against
the medics, a play-off for pro-
motion and the Gutteridge
Cup final where, if we retain
the trophy, we will achieve the
league and cup double!
