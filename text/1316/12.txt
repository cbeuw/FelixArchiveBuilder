CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk
By Peter Dickenson
It may have taken 57 years
since it was first held, but the
Hyde Park Relays commit-
tee finally managed to spread
the word and attract students
to this great event in large
numbers.
Some students were even
crazy enough to want to run
more than one leg for dif-
ferent teams. Pre-race entry
numbers from internal teams
were high, and you could
sense the buzz around cam-
pus leading up to Saturday.
The question now was how
to make this race one of the
most memorable ever for the
new competitors. We wanted
it to be remembered by eve-
ryone, both individually and
as a team thing. The latter
was easy – the camaraderie
that is produced year in, year
out by each team is unmistak-
ably obvious and so we did not
need to concentrate on that
too much. The former was
a bit more difficult. Meeting
after meeting was held until
we decided there was only
one way to make the race dif-
ferent for each runner – the
weather!
Whatever the competitors
thought, it was careful plan-
ning that made the weather
for each leg’s runner vary so
much. Using the proven Sod’s
Law Formula of pre-start glo-
rious sunshine to post-start
light drizzle, with strong
winds, heavy rain, hail and
all other weather conditions
in between, the committee
believed we truly made the
race unique. It was great to
see the competitors waiting
for their legs dashing back-
wards and forwards from the
Dell Café, trying to get some
protection from the weather.
Then, to finally complete the
Sod’s Law Formula, when the
very last runner crossed the
finish line we organised for
the sun to come out again.
Some committees are just
born with these preparation
skills!
Saturday may have been
the day of the 57th Hyde
Park Relays, but for the HPR
Committee it all began the
Wednesday before, when 50
crazy Polish students arrived
and took over Southside Gym.
The foreign invasion con-
tinued throughout the days
leading up to the event, with
the Dutch, Italian, German,
French, Welsh and Irish
arriving and crashing all
over the university. Various
members of the committee
had the ‘pleasure’ of sleeping
over with the teams – well,
‘sleeping’ is probably the
wrong word to use, seeing as
a sleeping bag was the only
cushion against the hard,
cold wooden floor. However,
the card games, sleeping bag
races and, of course, ridicu-
lous amount of drinking in
Southside Bar and the Union
contributed to the friendly
atmosphere (and headaches)
of the competitors.
When Saturday morning
came and the HPR commit-
tee was rudely awakened by
the sound of their alarms
(some as early as six in the
morning), race day prepara-
tions began with setting up
the race course, the JCR and
the Union, picking up the food
and drinking lots of strong
coffee.
At around 10.30am, the first
competitors came to register,
and at 2pm the men’s/mixed
race began to a huge cheer-
ing crowd. Five minutes later
the women’s race started.
Frank Horwill, the University
of London coach, kindly start-
ed both races to a rapturous
applause. Meanwhile, behind
the scenes, the commit-
tee were cutting the bread,
making the soup (not sur-
prisingly very popular, espe-
cially amongst the marshals
after the race, who had been
standing in the same place
for around three hours) and
sorting out the race t-shirts.
After the race had finished
and the course signs were col-
lected in, competitors headed
over to the JCR for some
after-race food and the pres-
entation. The men’s/mixed
race was won by ‘Goldsmith’s
Past and Present’, a guest
