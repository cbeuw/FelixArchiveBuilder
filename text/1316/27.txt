Imperial Devils 3
ULU B 6
By Tom Andrews
The Devils don’t normally like
to whine about tough games,
so in this report we’ll try to
stay positive. We were ready
to play our local rivals, the
upstart ULU team. However,
facing the brave Devils was a
ULU squad suspiciously bol-
stered by the presence of at
least six players from their A-
team, including their regular
A-team goaltender.
Due to the pleasing number
of female players on their
side (and the lack of on ours
(cheap advert)), the game
was limited to no contact.
The match started off well
for the Devils, as we domi-
nated them while constantly
probing into their zone and
firing shots at will on the ULU
goal.
Unfortunately ULU struck
first, with a goal completely
against the run of play. The
Devils had around 80% of
the possession during the
first period (though this fig-
ure grows every time we talk
about it), but despite our best
efforts ULU scored again.
Towards the end of the first
period, it emerged that our
star goaltender Ruth was
injured and had to be urgently
replaced. Our reserve ‘keeper
Carolyne, who had been hap-
pily spectating without a care
in the world, now had to step
up to the challenge of her
first real game. ULU took
advantage of this and got an
early goal in before she was
warmed up.
In the second period, the
Devils started strongly
(again), and our perseverance
and vehemence led to a devil-
ishly good strike from Sho to
reduce their lead. Three-one.
Despite this, it seemed that
lady luck had deserted us, as
although we had most of the
possession, every mistake we
made was punished by an A-
team-led counter-attack (and
a few more goals).
The goals on both sides
kept flying in, with Tom A
scoring from a few centime-
tres out, and David proving
that we could actually score
a proper goal with a nut-
meg of the goaltender. This
prompted ULU to put on five
A players at the same time, to
prevent them from conceding
any more.
Near the end of the match,
ULU showed their frustra-
tion by hitting David into the
boards from behind, after
which Yingke stepped in and
got himself two minutes in
the box.
The final score was an
undeserved 6-3 to the ULU B
team. And just to prove they
fielded more A team players
than allowed, here’s a snippet
of an email from their mail-
ing list: “Note, in the future
only two A team players will
be allowed to ice.” I guess
they really didn’t want to lose.
Whine over.

ing the ice hockey team, or

be intimidated by the game
– it’s basically hockey on ice
(imaginatively named) with-
out the rain.
