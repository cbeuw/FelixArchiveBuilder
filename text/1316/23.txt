Fancy a spot of après-ski?
Last month, a team of Imperial College students visited Switzerland to take
with Jenny Austin,
Gavin Daisley, Alex Law,
James Reddick and
Adit Singhal
Ah Switzerland, a fair swag
of clichés: irresistible choc-
olates, yodelling Heidis,
humourless bankers, inter-
national bureaucracies and
an orderly, anally retentive
and rather bland national
persona. But Harry Lime
was wrong on more than one
account when, in The Third
Man, he said 500 years of
Swiss democracy and peace
had produced nothing more
than the cuckoo clock. For a
start, the Germans invented
this monstrous timepiece.
Secondly, the Swiss, who are
a brainy lot, have won more
Nobel Prizes and registered
more patents per capita than
any other nation on earth.
Thirdly, as we were too find
out, they’re quite a sporty
bunch too.
So the scene was set for
the fifth IDEA League sports
event. For the uninitiated
of you, the IDEA League
is a collaboration between
Imperial College, Delft, ETH
Zurich and Aachen universi-
ties, and this collaboration is
strengthened each year by a
sports tournament. This year,
Imperial took on the cream of
European universities at bad-
minton, basketball and water
polo, and no-one was in the
least bit intimidated for the
simple reason that we were
all about to spend three days
in the lofty splendour of the
Swiss mountains in a small,
exclusive ski resort called
Davos.
Indeed, despite ETH Zurich
having a sports hall three
times the size of London on
their doorstep, they quite
rightly felt that everyone
would prefer playing indoor
sports at a height of 1560m,
with a view of the Alps out the
window.
And so, on day two, we
found ourselves trudging
through three feet of the whit-
est snow at 7.45am towards
the swimming pool for the
water polo tournament. The
stupid o’clock start was nec-
essary because at 12pm the
whole pool was being turned
into a conference centre for
the world economic forum.
Which was comforting, as it
meant that even world lead-
ers subscribed to the fact that
work is best done when com-
bined with the opportunity for
a spot of skiing!
The water polo was played
in a round robin format. First
up for Imperial were Aachen,
who were the eventual tour-
nament winners, beating
everyone. Imperial put out a
disciplined defensive strat-
egy, but Aachen had some
big outside shooters and were
able to find the back of the
net from distance, going 4-
1 up at the end of the first
period. Imperial managed to
pull the score back to 5-4 in
the second period, but in the
end the strength and depth of
Aachen proved too much, and
the game ended 10-4 in their
favour. Tim Keating scored all
Imperial’s goals.
Our next game was against
Zurich, a weaker side than
Aachenbutwithtwoverygood
players. One of these players
was very strong on 2m (cen-
tre forward) and won many
exclusion fouls and goals.
Richard Thoburn found him-
self ‘wrapped’ (three strikes
and you’re out) early in the
second period and Imperial
lost an important defensive
player. The game ended 11-8
to Zurich. Tim Keating was
once again the top scorer with
five goals, Chris Iliadis scored
two and Mary Kan scored the
other.
Our final game was against
Delft, and it followed straight
after the Zurich game with
little time for recovery. This
game would decide third
place, and it was very closely
contested with Imperial and
Delft always within one or two
goals of each other. We played
with passion and every player,
though tired, gave 100%. Sadly
we were unlucky to draw 9-9,
giving up possession cheaply
with 20 seconds remaining.
Delft scored with only eight
seconds on the clock.
Aachen had a fearsome
cheering squad and through-
out the tournament they were
winning, with well-rehearsed
chants of support. However,
Imperial also had a fantastic
set of fans (especially given
that the matches started at
8am!) It was great for the
water polo team to have so
much support from the side-
lines.
Imperial finished in last
place on goal difference, but
it was a great learning expe-
rience, cementing a great
team spirit. A special mention
should go to Soren, our IDEA
basketball player come water
polo super-sub who agreed
to play with us at the last
minute. Tim Keating must
surely have been ‘man of the
matches’, scoring 90% of the
goals.
Next up was the men’s bas-
ketball. Aachen’s team con-
sisted of footballers (appar-
ently Aachen don’t do bas-
ketball, so their footballers
and rowers battled it out to
see who would go), who were
royally trounced by Imperial.
Zurich’s team had a com-
bined height equivalent to
the matterhorn, which is due
to the combination of alpine
air and not much to do other
than grow, and so we were
royally trounced. Last up was
the cheeky team from Delft.
In a game that would decide
who would come second,
Imperial were in a command-
ing position, however, with
four minutes left Delft inched
two points in front whereupon
they started a song and dance
in double Dutch about techni-
cal fouls and the like until
the time ran out. Sadly we
finished third.
If you were to see Imperial’s
ladies’ team and guess the
sport they play, you’d be
unlikely to say basketball.
You could say that Imperial’s
women’s team is “vertically
challenged”. However, with
the kit finally arriving the day
before we departed, our girls
were raring to go and ready
to make the College proud.
On arrival in Switzerland
we discovered that our coun-
terparts were not so verti-
cally challenged and thought
“oh dear” (or something
along those lines!) Our first
match was against the team
from Aachen, who had no less
than three women over six
feet tall. But we were able to
prove that skills can count
for more than height, when
at half time we were in the
lead. Unfortunately Aachen’s
coach realised their advan-
tage and in the second half
put out their tallest team.
Our girls put up their best
defence, but if your opponent
is a foot taller than you, she
is going to get the ball! So we
narrowly lost the match.
We suffered defeats in our
other two matches, but did
ourselves proud and our spec-
tators were impressed with
the talent on the team. Our
two Spanish players, Beatriz
Alcolea and Olalla Del Rio,
deserve a special mention
for their fearless determina-
tion. Many of our points came
thanks to their fast breaks.
And then there was bad-
minton. The actual time spent
playing badminton during the
whole tour was about two
hours. Imperial came second
out of the four universities in
the competition, beaten nar-
rowly by Aachen. The format
of the games was strange to
say the least. Normally, all
matches are the best of three
games to 15 points each, but
the rotund organiser decided
to make the matches timed, ie
whoever has the most points
after 20 minutes of playing
wins. Folly. This format didn’t
help the Swiss (though nei-
ther did their hangovers) due
to the fact that the Aachen
team had one amazing pair
who destroyed all of our pairs
in 20 minutes. Before the tour,
typically, Imperial had decid-
ed that if anyone lost a match,
they would have to drink as
many shots as points they
lost by. This was quickly aban-
doned when Adit and Heather
lost one of our matches 49-11.
But the matches were good,
and after being content with
our performance, we got
down to the serious work: the
drinking.
And so with the bulk of tour-
nament complete, all that
remained were a few days
of damned good skiing and a
finale event in a little thing
called Hornschlitten Rennen.
Entering what was casu-
ally described as a four
man sledging competition,
Imperial’s four volunteers,
Gavin Daisley, Soren Krause,
Dmitry Pestov and Angharad
Care, had amiable thoughts
of pleasant days spent in the
prime of one’s youth on the
old rabbit hill with two inch-
es of snow and a homemade
sledge. Little did they know
that this ‘casual sledging
event’ was actually a 60kg 2m
long sledge (no tea trays for
them). One person sits at the
front with blades on to steer
the sledge, whilst the other
three sit behind, clinging on
desperately as brakes for this
monster by wedging their del-
icate feet into the snow.
With only one practice run,
where they spent less time
on the course than a UCL
student doing physics, it was
felt that Zurich had to be the
overwhelming favourites due
to the convenient fact that
they have a national coach.
In the semi-finals it was
Imperial versus Aachen. The
times in the trials had been
very close, so this looked to
be an exciting race. Aachen
pulled away first and no-one
thought we had a chance.
However, with Gavin employ-
ing a new driving style,
Imperial kicked in and around
