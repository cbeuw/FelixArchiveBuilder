A licence to extract stem cells
from human embryos has
been granted to the creator
of Dolly the sheep, Professor
Ian Wilmut. The UK regu-
latory body, the Human
Fertilization and Embryology
Authority, has granted the
therapeutic cloning licence
to Wilmut and Dr Paul de
Souza of the Roslin Institute,
Edinburgh, and Professor
Christopher Shaw of King’s
College London. This licence,
which is the second of its
kind to be awarded in the UK,
will allow the team to clone
human embryos for research
purposes.
Therapeutic cloning is dif-
ferent from human reproduc-
tive cloning, as the embryos
are only grown up to 14 days
before extracting the stem
cells. Wilmut has stated that
cloning a human is ethically
wrong and following the pub-
lic shock at Dolly’s creation,
he assured the world that he
would never consider cloning
humans. However, the award
of this licence has once again
opened Pandora’s box with
respect to the human cloning
and stem cell debate.
Wilmut and his team want
to use the stem cells to inves-
tigate motor neurone dis-
ease, the name given to a
debilitating group of condi-
tions that affect the motor
neurones of the brain and spi-
nal cord. Motor neurones are
the nerves which the brain
uses to send instructions to
the muscles in the form of
electrical impulses. Wilmut
will use a method known as
nuclear cell replacement,
which involves replacing the
nucleus of a human egg with
the nucleus of a cloned cell: in
this case a cell from a motor
neurone disease sufferer. As
the cells divide, stem cells,
which have the potential to
become any cell in the body,
are produced. The stem
cells can be differentiated
into neuronal cells and com-
pared to normal neurones in
an effort to understand the
defects responsible for motor
neurone disease.
Stemcelltechnologyhasthe
potential to alleviate the suf-
fering of thousands of people.
In addition to Wilmut’s motor
neurone research, the ability
of stem cells to become any
cell in the body may allow us
to replace defective or miss-
ing cells in persons with dia-
betes, Parkinson’s and cystic
fibrosis. In fact, Japanese
researchers recently claimed
in the Journal of Clinical
Investigation to have suc-
cessfully treated monkeys
with a condition similar to
human Parkinson’s through
stem cell transplantation.
Therapeutic cloning has the
potential to not only provide
a steady supply of stem cells
for research, but also to elim-
inate the problem of tissue
rejection during transplanta-
tion by allowing every patient
to be treated with cells from
his or her own body.
So what is the problem with
stem cell technology? The
main argument of Christian
and pro-life groups against
stem cell technology is based
on the belief that an embryo
is a living person from the
moment of conception, and
that extracting stem cells
– even from an early embryo
– is tantamount to infanti-
cide.
Many see the creation
of embryos for stem cell
research as an even worse
crime than simply harvest-
ing stem cells from existing
embryos and believe that this
will allow scientists to effec-
tively ‘play God.’ The debate
over whether the early foetus
constitutes life, the potential
for life or simply cells in a
Petri dish will no doubt rage
on.
At present, embryos left
over from fertility treatments
are the main source of stem
cells. Aborted foetuses are
another source. Is divert-
ing some of these unwant-
ed embryos towards medi-
cal research, which has the
potential to help many, right
or wrong? Even if these cells
are, in fact, a person, can we
really favour their survival
over the survival of a living
person who could be helped
by stem cell technology? If
you believe using embryonic
stem cells is equivalent to
infanticide, it all comes down
to whether it is acceptable
to consider one life expend-
able for the greater good.
This is, after all, the belief
that led to some of the most
deplorable acts in our history,
including US slavery and the
Holocaust.
Pro-life groups have point-
ed out that although scores
of people on death row in
America are ‘destined’ to die,
we would never consider har-
vesting their organs prior to
their executions. According to
such groups, using embryos
for their cells is a comparable
act, and these ‘cells in a dish’
deserve the same respect as
any living person. Is stem cell
technology creating a biotech
slave market where humans
are becoming commodities to
be sold for profit?
Human reproductive clon-
ing is a huge leap from the
therapeutic cloning pres-
ently being carried, and is
considered by the vast major-
ity of people to be ethically
unacceptable. But there will
always be some individuals
who do not share this opin-
ion. Recently we heard about
Little Nicky, the kitten cloned
to replace a dead pet for the
bargain price of $5000. Would
the grieving parents of a dead
child or an infertile couple
consider human cloning given
the choice?
Is this scenario, similar
to that portrayed by Aldous
Huxley in Brave New World
where humans are routinely
cloned, still science fiction or
do we really have something
to be worried about? Only a
few years ago it was thought
that the cloning of a human
embryo might be impossible
since removing the nucleus
was thought to rob the cell of
proteinsessentialforsurvival.
However, this hypothesis was
proved wrong in February
2004 by a team from South
Korea who succeeded in clon-
ing human embryos with the
potential to grow into a range
of tissue types.
A piece of research pub-
lished in October 2004 sug-
gested that the capability to
clone a human is potentially
not that far away when a
team of scientists success-
fully cloned primate embryos
and implanted them into a
womb. Although none of the
pregnancies lasted more than
a month, this is the closest
anyone has come to cloning a
primate, and it brings us one
step closer to being able to
clone a human.
But just because we can,
does that mean we will?

cloning a human
being is ethically
wrong... and assured
the world that he
would never
consider this”

Ivan Noble, the science and
technology writer for the
BBC News website, lost his
battle against a brain tumour
on 1 February and died at the
age of 37, leaving a wife and
two children.
The journalist had been
regularly, and openly, writing
about his experiences in his
Tumour Diary column on the
BBC website, which attracted
thousands of followers.
Tributes have been paid on
the BBC site from colleagues
and readers as well as in the
House of Commons, where a
motion speaking of ‘admira-
tion for his courageous fight’
was signed by nine Liberal
Democrat MPs.
Noble, who initially worked
for the BBC as a transla-
tor before joining the news
website in 2001, was diag-
nosed with a tumour in
August 2002. He began the
Tumour Diary in September
2002 in order to demystify
cancer and encourage open
discussion about the disease.
During the two years he
wrote the column, Noble
underwent three brain oper-
ations, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. On a happier
note, he also got married and
had a second child, born last
July.
After each of his 66 entries,
many readers’ comments
were posted, a large number
of them thanking him for
his openness and for help-
ing them come to terms with
their own cancer or that of
a relative. Medical students
and nurses also posted mes-
sages stating that Noble ena-
bled them to understand the
experiences of cancer suf-
ferers, aiding their ability to
treat patients.
Tributes from friends
described Noble’s refusal to
surrender to fear. In his last
entry, posted on 30 January,
he said he wanted the diary to
show people that they didn’t
have to be crushed by cancer.
Although he knew the cancer
would kill him, his last entry
bore the phrase “I have not
been defeated.”
He also thanked all who had
supported him: his friends,
family, the medical staff and
Macmillan nurse who treated
him since his diagnosis.
A collection of his diaries
will be published later this
year and proceeds will go to
charity.

Plant biotech goes
open-source
A team of scientists has devel-
oped an ‘open-source’ alterna-
tive to one of the most effec-
tive, but patent-protected,
ways of genetically modifying
plants. Until now, scientists
had to pay for licences to use
Agrobacterium, which was
thought to be the only bacte-
rium capable of transferring
foreign genes into plants. New
research published in Nature
reveals that other bacteria
can carry out gene transfer,
a development which could
allow scientists to avoid the
patent licencing process that
stifles innovation.
Call for £100m UK
stem cell fund
Leading UK scientists and
entrepreneurs are calling for
the creation of a charitable
foundation to promote and
fund stem cell research in
Britain. They believe this will
accelerate work on developing
new therapies for treating spi-
nal injuries and diseases such
as diabetes and Parkinson’s.
The group believes a fund of
£100m would be necessary to
anchor the UK’s position as a
leader in the field.
Genetic barcodes
for world’s species
A team of scientists has
launched an ambitious project
to genetically identify and
provide a barcode for every
plant and animal species on
the planet. By taking a snip-
pet of DNA from all the known
species on Earth and linking
them to photographs, descrip-
tions and scientific informa-
tion, the researchers plan to
build the largest database of
its kind. Less than one fifth
of the Earth’s estimated ten
million species of plants and
animals have been named.
Monkeys pay for
monkey porn
Scientists at Duke University
Medical Centre have found
that male monkeys pay to
check out the behinds of
female monkeys on a com-
puter. The scientists also
found out that the apes would
pay extra fruit juice rations
to see the faces of monkey
‘celebrities’. Professor Colin
Camerer, an expert on neur-
oeconomics at Caltech, said
that it is “no surprise that
male monkeys really like look-
ing at female posteriors.”
