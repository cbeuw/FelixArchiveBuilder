Griffith, Keaton, Ozu, Riefenstahl,
Ford, Welles, Bergman, Cissé
Chahine, Immamura, Scorsese and
Sokurov. These are just a few of the
directors Mark Cousins considers to
be particularly prolific, and I would
be surprised if more than a handful
of readers are familiar with more
than four of these names. Of course,
this should not discourage you from
reading The Story of Film.
Cousins’ book doesn’t focus on
the mainstream, not because it is
written in a pretentious way, but
because, generally, more successful
movies draw from other trendset-
ting movies and, thus, are not worth
mentioning in a book that guides the
reader through the history of film.
The Story of Film is a chronologi-
cal exploration of the cutting-edge
cinematic advancements that have
shaped film over the years.
The book is divided into three
epochs: silent, sound, and digital.
Over these periods, film evolved
due to developments in technol-
ogy and technique. But the most
important advancements, according
to Cousins, were the filmmaker’s
ideas.
Not only does Cousins describe the
films, but he also explains the phi-
losophy of art and its progression,
social influences and even genet-
ics (though briefly). It is impressive
to see just how much intellectual
material he draws from, and it’s
always refreshing for us Imperial
College students to find artists who
don’t have the usual fear of art’s
nerdier older brother: science.
Seeing film as art is often less than
natural for most people, especially
after watching the likes of Faster
and Even Furiouser. Cousins dis-
cusses Hollywood’s reluctance to
see film as art, and the tendency
of studios to follow the safe bet
with box office takings in mind. It is
interesting to read that American
film was originally based on the
East Coast until a patents war drove
many companies west at a time
when Los Angeles was just a sleepy
Southern California town. Cousins
cites Germaine Dulac’s 1920s avant-
garde films, which were influenced
by Monet and Charles Baudelaire,
as an example of art’s influence on
film.
The first film was shot in England
by a French man in 1888. Early
film was mainly focused on “tech-
nical thrills” like the famous foot-
age of a train pulling into a station
that is often associated with the
birth of cinema. Only after ten years
did films with more than one shot
appear, making longer scenes and
full-length body shots possible.
Thebook’schronologicalstructure
allows you to appreciate the sequen-
tial introduction of the ideas we
are so accustomed to now. During
television interviews today, the
camera cuts between views of the
actors’ faces and shoulders. When
ideas like this were conceived, it
was thought that sudden changes
would mentally jar the audience. A
reverse example is seen in Laurel
and Hardy films, which use a fairly
common method of looking directly
into the camera. This can feel wrong
to a viewer not accustomed to the
technique and may have unsettled
an early twentieth-century audi-
ence.
The main theme of the book is one
of schema and variation. Cousins
highlights techniques used by direc-
tors that are emulated by their
favoured predecessors. A typical
example (although not mentioned in
much depth in this book) is Quentin
Tarantino’s extensive use of the
Hong Kong film Hu Fen Yung’s
(City on Fire) plotline. Although
Tarantino borrowed heavily from
the storyline, the post-modern tech-
niques such as non-linear progres-
sion (cutting back and forth in time)
are what make the film unique. You
may expect that ideas for new film-
making techniques are running thin,
but you will find revolutionary films
are still being made today.
Film is an extraordinarily pow-
erful medium with the ability to
set social norms. The dominance of
Hollywood can be attributed to the
westernisation of eastern culture
and the world-wide prevalence of
the English language. Therefore,
Cousins’ detailed study of the his-
tory of film does a lot more than
discuss the plots and techniques
of various films, making the book a
fascinating read.
