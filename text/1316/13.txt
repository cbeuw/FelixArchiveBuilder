popular than Westwood
team, so Trinity College,
Dublin were the first univer-
sity team. The internal men’s/
mixed was won by ‘We Prefer
Vertical’ – the IC Outdoor
Club – in a time of 119 min-
utes and 12 seconds. The
next internal team was ‘IC
Theory Tortoises’ in a time of
128 minutes and 41 seconds.
Third was ‘IC Hockey’ in 129
minutes and 51 seconds. The
fastest internal individuals
were ‘Socks’, ‘Snuffy’ and
Alex Herbert.
In the women’s race, the
overall winners were Oxford
University. The ‘IC Boat
Club’ team won the internal
women’s race in a time of
59 minutes and 42 seconds.
Second place went to the
‘Lacrosse Ladies’ in a time
of 64 minutes and 58 seconds,
and ‘Beit Babes’ came third
in a very respectable time of
67 minutes and 32 seconds.
The fastest internal individu-
als were Carlyn Greenhalgh,
Leila Shepherd and Chinedu
Igwe.
Both the men’s/mixed and
women’s winning teams
received the First Internal
Race Shield, on which their
names will be inscribed for-
ever and, of course, as should
occur in every student race,
alcohol was amongst the
prizes!
The ‘Gary Hoare’ prizes
were also given out. Gary is
a former IC Cross Country
Club Member, whose sole aim
was to be last in a race but
first to the pub afterwards!
In the past, people have
deliberately tried to win the
wooden spoons. The ‘Gary
Hoare’ awards for internal
teams this year went to ‘Jnes’
in the men’s/mixed race and
‘The Dawes Road Runners’.
Congratulations guys, you
are the envy of every other
competitor and that is the
truth!
Once the presentation
had finished, it was time for
another clearing-up job for
the committee, whilst com-
petitors who hadn’t showered
did so. The crazy Polish put
their make-up on (both the
men and the women) and
the committee chair had the
first of many well-deserved
pints at the exclusive after-
race party in dBs. The
boat race was won by the
‘Mellingtons’, a team consist-
ing of some of the IC Cross
Country Club, although I do
not know how, because ‘Mr
Mellington’ himself has to be
one of the worst neckers I
have ever seen. There was
an extended bar licence and
around £3700 was taken on
the bars, which was signifi-
cantly more (over 20%) than
the Union’s Friday night
Valentines party featuring
Tim Westwood – but then we
did have the crazy Polish!
Thank you once again to
all the competitors who took
part. You make the event
what it is. The HPR com-
mittee would like to person-
ally thank IC, ICU, catering,
security, all their former
friends who helped marshal
and everybody else, who, if
mentioned, would fill Felix.
However, a special mention
must go to Kris Rajamanikam
and Aziz Bilgrami, without
whose help the Hyde Park
Relays and internal competi-
tion would never have hap-
pened. Thanks guys!
Although it is not official yet,
it is likely that the next Hyde
Park Relays will be over the
Valentines Weekend – that’s
11 February 2006, so pencil it
into your calendar. An official
date will be announced when
next year’s chair is elected.
This year’s chair is now tak-
ing a well-earned rest.
Full results and photos can
be found on our official web-
site, www.union.ic.ac.uk/hpr.
As more photos come in,
the website will be updated.
If anybody has any photos
that they took on the day and
are willing to share them,
then could they please burn
them onto a CD and email
peter.dickenson@ic.ac.uk so
they too can be put onto the
site.
If you enjoyed Hyde Park
Relays and would like to go

We hope to see you all there
next year!
