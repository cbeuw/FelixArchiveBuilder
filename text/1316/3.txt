It’s all for a good cause...

anyone unfamiliar with the
concept, this meant that they
ran naked from Harrods to
Beit Quad. Photographs exist
but are not online or available
for publication.
On Friday night at ‘Dave’s
Distance Dash’, the aim was
simple: get as far away as pos-
sible from The Goose (a nota-
ble drinking establishment
in Fulham) without spending
any money. A good number of
‘competitors’ turned up, but
the wherabouts of many of
them remains unknown. One
made it Canterbury following
a very long walk. Perhaps ply-
ing all the entrants with drink
before letting them out into
the night was not the best
plan ever made.
On Saturday, the closure
of the Circle Line meant
that keen fundraisers set
off on the rather unfamil-
iar ‘Hammersmith and City
Line, District Line, Piccadilly
Line and Replacement Bus
Service’ pub crawl. Would
anyone make it to the end? At
the time of writing, we’re still
not sure!
Finally, on Valentine’s Day,
the barbershop quartets were
out in force to serenade their
way tunefully around cam-
pus.
Also going on during the
week were trips up the
Queen’s Tower, which were
all over-subscribed, and
attacks from the infamous
City and Guilds Hit Squad,
who seemed to enjoy covering
everyone in whipped cream.
The RAG committee would
like to thank everyone who
helped out by collecting,
donating, turning up or doing
whatever you did. A final total
will be published soon at www.
union.ic.ac.uk/rag.
Final preparations are now
being made for one of the
biggest events in College
this year. By now, most of
you will have heard about the
Entertain Charity Ball that
is happening on Saturday 26
February. For those of you
still unsure about whether to
go or not, let me enlighten
you.
Firstly, it’s a ball and tickets
are only a tenner. Just £10
for a whole ball! Because of
very generous support from
a number of companies, and
the hard work and determi-
nation of medics and engi-
neers from Imperial College,
every penny of your £10 ticket
price will go straight to the
ongoing redevelopment work
in the areas worst affected by
the tsunami.
This ball would normally
cost thousands, but it has
effectively been put on for
free! It is a one-off chance
for students at Imperial
College to collectively raise
tens of thousands of pounds
for this important cause in
one action-packed, qual-
ity evening of live music and
DJs.
The venue is the Sherfield
Building, Imperial College,
South Kensington. Yes, I know
you take your exams in the
Great Hall, but for one night
only, a massive 40kW sound
system and a huge light show
will delight and entertain you.
Exams? What exams?
The MDH and Ante Room
will be the places to mingle,
catch the famous Jazz Big
Band, and pick up some of the
hot food that will be available
for your delectation.
The line-up includes the
infamous ‘Our Souls’, pro-
viding an upbeat, funky and
involving stage show. The
key to their name is to say
it to yourself in your head a
few times. I chuckled. Lots.
Cartel provide the rock back-
up, making their second visit
to Imperial College, all the
way from Stoke. These guys
must not be missed!
DJs will cater for all your
musical tastes, ranging from
cheese to party rock to R’n’B
to house. London superclub
DJ MacPherson will be wrap-
ping the ball up with some fat
tunes. There is even a cool
magician on hand to impress
and amaze.
So why should you come?
It’s a ball, for a tenner, which
all goes to charity, and it will
be a great night out. What
other excuse do you need?
There is no dress code, so
feel free to wear what you
like.
Make sure you don’t make
the mistake of thinking it
won’t be any good for £10. Let
me assure you it will look and
sound fantastic, and will rival
any ball you have been to in
the past.
Tickets are on sale from
Union reception and the
Reynolds Bar now. Watch out,
they’re selling like hot cakes.
Get yours before there’s no
cake left and you’re hungry. If
you want further convincing,
and no mention of free cake,

entertain-event.co.uk.
Let them Entertain you

Sabbatical
elections
attract
highest ever
turnout
By Dave Edwards
Editor
Over 2800 students have voted
in this year’s Imperial College
Union sabbatical elections,
the highest turnout ever.
The online ballot system led
to the start of voting being
delayed for several hours on
Friday morning, but there
have been few other problems
with the election process so
far. Many observers were
pleased to note the relative
lack of election-related com-
plaints compared with previ-
ous years.
Several theories have
been put forward as to why
the turnout is so high this
year. The race for President
being closely fought by five
candidates may well be a
factor, as could the blanket
coverage afforded to the elec-
tions by the student media.
Students’ dissatisfaction
with certain College and
Union policies may also have
encouraged them to have
their say.
The sabbaticals are the
most senior student officers
within the Union, and the high
turnout should result in them
being taken more seriously by
the College. Mustafa Arif, the
current President, said: “The
higher the turnout in the elec-
tions, the more the Union’s
voice is respected.”
Results are due to be
announced tonight and will be
published at www.felixonline.
co.uk.
