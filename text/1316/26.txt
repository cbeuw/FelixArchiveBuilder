Results
By Kate Douglas
It was the first competition
for the immense Imperial
College B Team. This year
we were pitched against
Reading, Surrey and the Vets.
The short story here is that
we won, outright. That’s how
good we are, you see. Our
dressage tests were all close
to perfection and we all went
clear in the jumping. So, the
day ended with us driving off
into the sunset clutching our
shiny red first place rosettes
and beaming with pride. But
then I woke up… and it was
6.30 in the morning, really
cold and still dark.
Not a great start to a day
that didn’t get much better.
The train ride was verging on
the duller side of not interest-
ing, and then we had to bat-
tle the streets of Reading to
find the damn stables, which
we managed to do with five
minutes to spare. So maybe
things weren’t going to be
so bad.
The dressage came first,
as it tends to do because
the rules say so. The horses
seemed ok. There was noth-
ing exciting or interesting, so
we picked who we wanted
and off we went. Kat rode
first on a skewbald cob that
resembled a tank and did a
good job. Then it was Sarah
on a wiry and sort of bald-
ing chestnut called Newman.
Apparently her test went
well, according to El and Kat,
but the judge didn’t agree and
suggested that she “try to
ride the horse”. Good advice,
I suppose.
I was third and probably
couldn’t have done worse if I
tried. William (another wiry
chestnut) didn’t like me or
the arena so stepped out sev-
eral times. The judge didn’t
like this, or me for that mat-
ter, and accused me of talking
during the test, crazy lady!
Lastly it was El’s turn and
she did very well. Her horse
was small, cute and looked
lazy but wasn’t.
Thankful that the first part
of afternoon was over, we
sat down for lunch and then
found out that we were cur-
rently in fourth position. Not
that this was a surprise, but
it definitely didn’t improve
the day any. My amazing
performance meant that I
only did marginally better
than the girl who looked like
she didn’t even know what a
horse was.
The end of the day was
jumping. William and
Newman were back and
were joined by a fluffy pony
and the biggest horse in the
world. El chose Newman, Kat
took William, Sarah chose
the pony, and being brav-
est (read: dumbest) I had
Pembridge the giant, who
was actually gorgeous and
easy to ride. Kat almost went
clear but knocked down the
style which was quite hard to
get a good line to.
I redeemed myself by going
clear on Pembridge, as did
El although she didn’t have
any redeeming to do. Sarah
was last and the little pony
was super-duper but halfway
round she lost her stirrups so
circled away from the jump.
This, apparently, meant she
was eliminated which was
totally harsh and I think it
was the wrong decision, but
who are we to argue?
And so the day came to an
end. We pulled up in fourth
position with a shocking
number of penalties which
I won’t divulge here. El got
herself an individual seventh
place. Good for her! But we
were glad to get home.
Somehow, the competition
had dragged on for six hours,
the scoring was messed up
but the highlights were defi-
nitely the cat who hung out
on my shoulder a lot, the fat
ugly dog, the blind girl and
lunch. Oh, and the Union
later that evening. That was
fun too. And just so you know,
John Peers said that thing
about a cavalry.
RIDING
“You can’t lead a cavalry
if you think you look funny
riding a horse”
RVC Women’s 1st 12
Wye Women’s 1st 22
By Lucy Le Cocq
There was only one thing
between Wye and the cup
final: the vets. And we had
a lot to prove. Having never
put any points past them, we
were not prepared to let it
happen again. So, avoiding
road rage by leaving number
eight to find her own way to
the game, we were ready to
show the vets how we usu-
ally play. And we didn’t hang
around.
Although everybody was
feeling the pressure, we man-
aged to divert this into posi-
tive energy and had the first
score on the board within
ten minutes. Another one of
Emily’s elusive (sorry to use
this word again; other words
in the thesaurus were unsuit-
able) runs gave us the first
try which helped us to settle
and enjoy the game a little
more.
Massive bandaging was
needed for the backs, who all
seem to have acquired shin
splints except Andrea, who
still managed to produce a
beautiful pink display of band-
aging so that she didn’t feel
left out. Massive force at the
beginning of the game in the
tackling department from
everybody appeared to sur-
prise the vets as they had
not come up against such a
force at the beginning of the
season.
Gobby scored the second try
and then converted it, stamp-
ing our authority on the game.
Wye were now free to play in
our usual style. The backs
enjoyed prolonged spells of
running after this and made
much ground. Although the
forwards didn’t exhibit the
usual storming runs, they
showed great strength in
the scrum and even turned
it over.
Spaz’s and Pike’s breaking
from the scrum produced
some great interceptions of
the ball and their players.
Our full back remained calm
throughout, even when chal-
lenged with some difficult
kicks and tackles which were
successfully accomplished.
By half time, we had scored
four tries and both teams
were much relieved to have
a break. We faced uphill into
the wind in the second half.
The difficult conditions
allowed the RVC an opportu-
nity to score from a penalty,
which was swiftly taken. They
managed to put another try
past us later in the second
half.
The game was well control-
led by both sides, however
Wye came out on top. This
was a promising game and
Wye are looking forward to
the final, which we intend to
contest strongly.
The Wye rugby girls were
thrilled to win and feel that
this shows great potential
for our cup final and for the
sevens tournaments that we
will be playing in later in the
season.

for Vets at last
