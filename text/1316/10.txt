Juggling is something of a
versatile art. It has connec-
tions with such pursuits as
magic, balloon modelling and
gymnastics. Other connec-
tions may seem less obvious,
and this brings me neatly
onto the subject of today’s
article: whip cracking.
Come on, admit it. Who
hasn’t wanted to be (or be
with) Indiana Jones at some
point? Armed with a proper
leather bullwhip, the skilled
whip-cracker can put out
candles without touching the
candle itself, split an A5 sheet
of newspaper in half without
the person holding it feeling
anything, and, of course, grab
beer bottles and pull them
across the room. Dodging
giant balls of stone and com-
bating Nazi archaeologists
are optional extras.
The first thing to do is
choose your whip carefully
– a badly made whip will be
both hard to crack and more
likely to hurt you. A leather
bullwhip about 10ft long is
an ideal starting point. Run
it along the ground behind
you in a straight line [see pic-
ture 1]. If it isn’t straight, it’s
going to wrap around your leg
on the way past and possibly
even perform an impromptu
castration.
Make sure there are no poor
sods within whipping dis-
tance, and ideally nobody for
quite some distance in front
of you – the whip is capable
of picking up small bits of grit
and propelling them at Mach
2 or above, which is cool in a
geeky kind of way, if a little
painful for the recipient.
Swing the whip forwards so
that it rotates up and finally
drops behind you [see picture
2].
Once the whip is behind
you, bring your arm forward
in a smooth motion to put a
loop in the whip [see picture
3]. This loop is the bit that
actually gives you a big crack.
It accelerates down the whip,
and once it passes through
the sound barrier a crack is
heard. The important thing
to note is that a big crack
doesn’t take strength, it takes
good technique. Putting a
good loop in the whip is far
more important than flinging
it around [see picture 4].
OK, that’s all there is to it.
Since we are at a science and
technology college though,
here’s the science:
What makes a whip crack
– it’s the tip creating a sonic
boom, right? Not quite.
Professor Alain Goriely from
the University of Arizona
performed some theoreti-
cal modelling in 2002, which
showed that it isn’t the tip
breaking the sound barrier
that causes the crack, rather
it is the loop. Measurements
have put the accelerations at
the tip during a crack at well
over 50,000G, which is why
the tip can do so much dam-
age. Anyone who hits them-
selves during practice will be
able to testify to this.
Well, there you have it
– another strange juggling-
associated art demystified. As
I’m sure you’re aware by now,
Imperial’s Juggling Society
meets on Tuesday evenings
from 6pm. Email juggling@ic.

The TBR (To Be Released)
Series is IC Radio at its most
mainstream and has been
running in one form or anoth-
er for the past three years,
progressively getting bigger
and bigger.
TBR actually consists of
three rather unique shows,
but the central theme is
bringing you the best in new
music. I strive to play the hot-
test forthcoming singles as
soon as possible, sometimes
even before commercial sta-
tions.
The newest stuff can always
be heard on the Monday night
show, the original TBR, along
with the top five selling sin-
gles, the day’s new releases
and a rundown of the weekly
online vote.
On Wednesdays you can
tune in to TBR: Here & Now
which focuses more on music
news – I run down my chart
predictions and summarise
the big stories in music, all
interspersed with new music
taken from the TBR playlist.
Finally I kick off Friday
nights with TBR: The Remix,
which is just about getting
people in the mood for the
weekend with big upcoming
urban singles plus a few cool
remixes and mash-ups.
All three shows are totally
interactive, running special
features which can be found
on TBR’s very own website:
http://shows.icradio.com/tbr.
For example, you can vote
for the Most Requested
throughout the week, request
any of the new songs I have
to play for you, browse
the latest music news and
gossip, check out the singles
and album charts…
The interactivity is a central
part of the way TBR works – I
want to play the new music
that you want to hear. You
don’t necessarily have to call
up live on air if you don’t want
to (though I always like chat-
ting to listeners), you can
simply use the website to air
your opinions and make your
selections.
Every now and again, TBR
also runs very special fea-
tures such as competitions
and interviews. For example,
this year I’ve interviewed the
likes of The 411, Jamie Scott,
Raghav, Estelle and Jamie
Cullum for the shows as well
as covering the MOBO and
Brit Awards from beside the
red carpet.
A lot of work goes into
the TBR Series so that you
don’t have to trawl through
the other stations, internet,
newspapers and magazines.
If you want to know about
new music and what’s going
on in the mainstream music
world, all you have to do is
listen to IC Radio on 999AM
in Southside and Linstead,
1134AM in Wye (thanks to the
IC Trust) or the online stream
at icradio.com every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday from
6pm. You don’t even have
to listen live – recordings of
the shows are also available
online for you to listen at your
leisure.
But even if mainstream
music isn’t to your taste, we
have a wide range of pro-
gramming from the most
alternative music to drum
and bass to genres I’d never
even heard of before. There’s
a show out there for almost
everyone, and if there isn’t
one for you, why not start it
yourself? Visit the website for
details.
