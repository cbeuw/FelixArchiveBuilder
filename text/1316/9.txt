NISHANT DESHPANDE
graduated in 1997 with a
BEng in Information Systems
Engineering (ISE). He’s had
an interesting career path,
like many IC graduates.
After Imperial, he joined
Goldman Sachs in London
for three years, after which
he decided to do an MS in
Artificial Intelligence at
Stanford. This was followed
by a job at the Oracle head-
quarters in California, while
at present he’s working for a
startup company in the US.
Did you always want to
go into IT?
No. I really didn’t know
much about computers at
school. I liked chemistry and
almost went to do Chemical
Engineering at Nottingham
University. Then I decided to
take a year out between A-
levels and university. During
part of that year, I worked for
a software company, and from
then on, I was in IT.
Can you tell us more
about what your present
work involves?
For the last five months, I
have been working at Efficient
Frontier (www.efrontier.
com). We are a search mar-
keting company that handles
keyword advertising for our
customers. Therefore, when
you search for something on
Google or Yahoo, you seethe
‘true’ search results and the
paid ads on top and on the
side. There is a live 24-hour
auction going on amongst the
competing ads to be shown,
for each search phrase.
We optimize this advertis-
ing channel by applying
quantitative methods and a
portfolio approach to han-
dling all the keywords and
ads our customer has and
enabling the customer to bet-
ter achieve their advertising
goals.
Since joining, I have been
working on exposing a lot of
our functionality to custom-
ers via our website. The tech-
nology I am using is Java,
Linux, Struts, and a lot of
database work.
What did your work at
Goldman Sachs involve?
How did you come to do
your MS in Artificial In-
telligence at Stanford?
Each business unit at
Goldman Sachs had its own
IT to develop and support
applications for that busi-
ness. I joined a new team for
the Equity Capital Markets
group in London. We started
with three people, including
my boss. We learnt about the
business and then developed
applications to make the busi-
ness processes more efficient.
I was there for three years,
and I really enjoyed it.
I had several motivations
for doing an MS. I was keen
to explore and to get a much
deeper and broader set of
skills and knowledge tech-
nicall. Also, of course, there
was the lure of Silicon Valley
and California at the height of
the dot com boom.
So, all of the above pointed
to Stanford. As for Artificial
Intelligence, I took an
‘Introduction to AI’ course
in my first quarter, and got
interested in the subject, and
continued to take AI courses
until I had enough to spe-
cialize in AI (the degree is
from the Computer Science
department).
Do you think there are
more opportunities in
the States in your line of
work?
Definitely, simply because the
US market is so large, and
the Bay Area (no one calls it
‘Silicon Valley’ here) is unlike
any other place for technol-
ogy, not just compared to
Europe but pretty much any-
where else in the US. It is just
like London is the centre for
finance and investment bank-
ing in Europe and New York
the centre in the US.
Having said that, I think
London and Cambridge have
a lot of things going on in the
technology sector, and there
have already been some suc-
cess stories. I am sure there
will be more in the future.
How was your experi-
ence at Imperial?
I was in the ISE batch, and
we renamed it ‘Instant Sanity
Erosion’. It was a small class
– I think the BEng batch was
probably around 35 students
– and most people were real-
ly hard working, so it was
hard work just keeping up
with everyone. But, of course,
I think for most people the
undergraduate degree is the
most fun; it was for me.
The teaching and facilities
were very good. Looking back,
I wish I had spent more time
exploring the general area
that I was studying; we were
at college when the internet
was taking off. But I’ve never
really liked sitting in a base-
ment in front of a computer
screen for more time than
necessary, especially when
the other options were sitting
in the Queens Arms...
Do you think being at
Imperial has equipped
you well for your future?
I have worked with people
from many different univer-
sities, and I think you can
always count on a person
from Imperial to know his or
her stuff, and be really hard-
working and tenacious in
finding solutions, much more
than most other universities.
I don’t know whether that is
the effect of a few years at
Imperial, or the type of per-
son that comes to IC. Either
way, if you can do fairly well at
IC with the stiff competition
that exists, I think you can be
confident you can do well in
the future.
Do you have any advice
to students wanting
to get into your line of
work or advice resulting
from your experiences?
Work as a software engineer
faces increasing competi-
tion from people in devel-
oping countries, like India
and China. You have to have
something extra to be of value
in this field. This means hav-
ing first a really solid under-
standing of the basics – the
more I have worked in this
field, the more times I have
had to look at the basics to get
to a better solution.
The other great thing about
this field is that there is very
little between theory and
practice. If you know some-
thing, you should be able to
implement it. Keep thinking
like that and trying to put it
in practice, and your learning
will increase exponentially.
JOHN STAVELEY gradu-
ated from Imperial in 1997
with an Honours and a
Masters Degree in Chemical
Engineering. He was treas-
urer of the Entertainments
Committee at IC and also
wrote for various College
publications. He then went
on to complete an MPhil in
computational fluid dynamics
and a Postgraduate Diploma
of Management while at
UMIST, where he also did
part time tutoring and dem-
onstrating. After finishing
his studies, he worked for
Enviros Software Consulting
Team. His role as a software
consultant to the environ-
mental sector involved work-
ing with clients such as BP
,
the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Environment
Agency, the MoD and
Kuwaiti Oil and Gas. After
fouryears with Enviros, he’s
now a software engineer for
Walker Morris Online where
he is involved in designing
and developing software
products and also in the
marketing and sales of these
products.
Did you always want to
go into Software Engi-
neering?
No, I was always interested
in science. My MEng and
MPhil were both in Chemical
Engineering, though the
computational element of my
MPhil was very high. I had
been programming since I
was 13 though, so computing
always made sense to me.
What made you want to
do postgraduate study
after you finished at
Imperial?
I didn’t really feel Imperial
stretched me. It taught me to
learn by rote and I wanted to
be more creative with what I
had learnt and apply it some-
where. Research was very
interesting, but doing a EngD
course relies a lot on having a
good supervisor, and mine left
three months after I joined. I
greatly enjoyed research, it
was a great personal chal-
lenge which I found fulfilling,
but I didn’t like the world of
academia.
How did you come to do
a year of management
studies? Would you
recommend it to other
postgraduate scientists
who perhaps wish to
leave research for busi-
ness or industry?
This is the taught part of an
MBA and is part and parcel
of the EngD course (four year
PhD plus applied research
and management). It’s very
difficult to obtain MBA fund-
ing in the UK and this was a
good way in. I found it very
useful and I’m sure it will pay
me dividends for a good while
to come.
I found the transition
from research to industry
extremely easy – I’m not
sure how others would cope.
I found the world of academia
very inward-looking and not
always interested in solving
problems that would be use-
ful in the real world, whereas
I always wanted to know how
to apply research.
How was your experi-
ence at Imperial?
I didn’t much like the place.
There are better ways of
spending four years. It
deserves as good a reputation
as Oxford or Cambridge, if not
better for some departments.
I enjoyed being in London,
this has much to offer.
Do you think being at
Imperial has equipped
you well for your future?
It gives you an intellectual
rigour and ability to solve
problems. It definitely has a
certain style about it, it gives
you a work ethic like no other,
and the name opens doors.
There is an oft-quoted sta-
tistic that Imperial graduates
earn consistently more than
graduates of other universi-
ties. This may be because
they choose to stay in London
where salaries are higher...
but quality of life isn’t, I
have to add. When choosing
where to work, bear in mind
that £28k buys very little in
London, whereas in most
other parts of the country it
buys a lot. I believe eventually
London will suffer commer-
cially because of this.
Do you think that your
extra-curricular activi-
ties during your stud-
ies were a big plus
when looking for jobs?
Did they develop your
skills?
I think I got a huge amount
from these activities. They
were also fun and allowed
me to meet some of the
more interesting people at
Imperial. They’ve been occa-
sionally mentioned in inter-
views. Most people mention
the travelling I’ve done since.
Employers are looking for
an individual who can com-
municate and work as a team.
The jobs where this isn’t a
requirement are very few
and far between. I think that
this is somewhere Imperial
lets you down – you spend
so much time working that
you don’t get much time to
socialise.
Do you have any advice
to students wanting
to get into your line of
work or advice resulting
from your experiences?
The first job is difficult, but
once on the ladder things
are much easier. When you
go to interview, know some-
thing about their industry and
come across as enthusiastic.
Emphasise your team work-
ing and communication skills.
A key skill for computing is
attention to detail.
Don’t walk into the first
job you get. You don’t need
a job, you need the job. If you
can afford to, hold back. The
market is pretty good at the
moment, whereas two years
ago it was very difficult.
Big companies are not
always better. I got an
extremely good variety of
experience working as part of
a very small team.
