Since this is Valentine’s week,
I am ignoring all depressing
news from around the globe
(I am seriously depressed
enough) and just seeing
how the nation reacted to
the ‘heartwarming’ story of
Charlesfinallymakinganhon-
est woman of Camilla. Isn’t
that a lovely tale to warm the
cockles of your heart? No?
You’re not alone.
The news was met, over-
all, by indifference from most
of the nation, although some
of the newspapers went
a bit overboard. The Daily
Mail and The Daily Express
went all-out as if this were
a proper royal wedding (the
“love affair of the century”?)
and not a second-time-round
event for the couple who so
cruelly cheated on Diana.
In fact, most commentators,
left and right wing, monar-
chist and republican, had an
attitude of “at bloody last”. As
The Daily Telegraph put it: “It
has always seemed strange
that the country preferred a
prince living in sin with his
lover to a formal marriage...
it was so furtive and teenage,
it made him look adolescent.”
The length of the relationship
– the couple met at a polo
match in the seventies, long
before Charles met Diana –
was frequently mentioned, as
was the ‘Squidgygate’ series
of hideously embarrassing
phone calls between the pair
which were recorded in 1992.
William and Harry were
said to be delighted, as was
the Queen. Lovely. So why
the dissent? Well, the mon-
archists are worried about
whether Camilla will become
Queen or not. Call me stupid,
but I had always thought that
having a monarchy meant
that you cannot choose who
they are. You put up with what
you are given. In any case, the
choice of title was a tricky one
that has ended with her being
the Duchess of Cornwall and
eventually the meaningless
but fancy ‘Princess Consort’.
In other words, she will be to
Charles what Albert was to
Victoria.
Some of us were already
groaning at the thought of the
overwhelming news coverage
that will lead up to the wed-
ding. If you are too, I advise
you to read the republican
press, namely The Guardian,
which is hilarious: “Tripe,
tosh and trivia will dominate
the press... there will be royal
schmaltz by the bucketload.
And there will be faux moral-
ising of hideous proportions,
then there will be absurd
constitutional folderols about
protocol and religion. This will
be treated as if it were Henry
VIII all over again – history
repeated as farce.”
I also advise a look at the
message boards on the BBC
website, which are full of won-
derfully furious messages
from Americans, who seem to
have nominated themselves
protectors of Diana on Earth.
To everyone who actually
enjoys these things, congrat-
ulations, and please, please
make it a bank holiday.
Charles and Camilla
A romantic, heartwarming tale?

On Friday, members of the
‘ImperialagainstImperialism’
group hung a huge anti-war
banner over the balcony of the
electrical engineering library,
overlooking the main walk-
way of the South Kensington
campus.
The group took the action
in protest against, in their
words, “the unjust and ille-
gal invasion and occupation
of Iraq”. They left the bal-
cony after 45 minutes and
then demonstrated around
the campus, where they were
joined by other students.
The banner bore the slogan:
“No more lies, no more war”.
Also written on it were the
words: “Demonstrate March
19th, central London”, a ref-
erence to the international
anti-war demonstration tak-
ing place on that day.
One protester, Petros
Wallden, told Felix: “I believe
that university is about edu-
cating people as citizens and
not only as scientists. Matters
of foreign policy, such as the
occupation, do concern the
students, and as students
they want to protest.”
He added: “When [College]
Security got serious, we dis-
mantled the banner and left
peacefully.” Members of ‘Imperial Against Imperialism’ make their feelings known to the rest of the College
Students protest against
Iraq occupation with
massive anti-war banner
