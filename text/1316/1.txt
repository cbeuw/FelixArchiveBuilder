RAG raises
thousands
By Chris Jackson
For those of you who have
been walking around with
your eyes and ears closed, last
week was Imperial College
Union RAG Week. There was
a large amount of random
strangeness and insanity
from all those who took part,
raising thousands of pounds
for Cancer Research UK and
the Mercury Phoenix AIDS
Trust.
Monday morning saw the
RAG team surface bright and
early to collect at the gates
during the big rush to 9am
lectures. At lunchtime, the
Physical Sciences Union sold
Krispy Kreme doughnuts on
the walkway outside the JCR.
Despite ample supplies, these
all sold out, making a sizeable
contribution to RAG funds.
Beside the doughnut stall
were Zaki Nuseibeh and John
Collins playing an upright
piano. RAG legend Atul Rana
then appeared with his guitar
and a lively jamming session
followed, including an inim-
itable version of the Louis
Armstrong classic Wonderful
World. Those who heard it
will surely never forget it, and
neither will their therapists.
The icing on the doughnut,
so to speak, was provided by
an election campaigner hand-
ing out tins of beans, adding
to the carnival atmosphere
so rarely seen at Imperial
College.
To celebrate Shrove
Tuesday, a pancake race was
held. This involved running
around Beit Quad collecting
the ingredients for the batter
in a skiff before limboing and
slaloming, trying not to spill
the mix. The mess left in the
Quad was unbelievable but
was eventually dealt with by a
heavy rain shower. Needless
to say, few of the pancakes
were considered edible,
except for one near-perfect
offering from the winner of
this slightly bizarre event,
Hamish Pearse-Danker.
In line with RAG tradition,
the raid on London took place
on the Wednesday. A slightly
disappointing turnout saw a
hardcore elite of participants
raise over £1400 by running
around London doing pretty
much anything they could
think of, including swim-
ming in Trafalgar Square and
stealing policemen’s helmets.
I don’t want to go into too
much detail here, just in case
the Old Bill ever catch up
with me.
On Thursday, a City and
Guilds bar night was com-
bined with a slave auction to
attract the punters. A wide
range of Union celebrities
were auctioned off, rais-
ing well over £1000. Several
unfortunate students left the
auction considerably bal-
der than before, as buyers
became more interested in
shaving people’s heads for
charity than actually purchas-
ing ‘slaves’.
At around 11.30pm, as the
night drew to a close, a joint
bid of £280 resulted in City
and Guilds President John
Collins and Royal School
of Mines President John
Sykes embarking on the tra-
ditional ‘Harrods run’. For
