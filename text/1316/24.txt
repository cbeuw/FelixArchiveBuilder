What a good IDEA!
part in the annual IDEA League sports event
25
the outside of Aachen, dart-
ing into the lead. Indeed, even
the Swiss national coach shed
a tear of joy as he witnessed
such exquisite style and
poise.
In a head to head Imperial-
Zurich final, all was at stake;
Zurich apparent masters
of modern sport, with their
alpine fitness, snow sport
heritage and national coach
against Imperial, by far the
most intelligent, but lacking
the athletic edge and still
getting used to the fact that
more snow had fallen here in
the last 24 hours than in 24
years back in England.
Off they went and at the
top of the hill, incredibly,
Imperial were ahead. But
soon Zurich managed to pull
across in front of us, leaving
no option but to ram them
off the course. However, they
turned the corner before we
reached them, but what a bad
corner it was for them. They
hit the inside post and, once
again, Imperial went around
the outside. We were about
one foot down side by side
as we rammed them prop-
erly. Soren wisely pulled
back their sledge and they
tried to push away from us.
By the final corner, Zurich
were clearly going to win,
until Gavin dived on one of
their players and pulled him
and the sledge back. Imperial
went past them and onto the
log before Zurich started to
attack our sledge. After a
couple of minutes of fight-
ing, Zurich were in trouble,
their sledge upturned, their
lead girl on her back and the
three guys being pulled off
our sledge. Imperial were just
seconds from a glorious victo-
ry when the officials declared
the event a draw.
To be honest, though, it
was proud finish and lifted
the name of Imperial on high.
Despite coming last overall in
the tournament, the Imperial
team did themselves justice.
Living in London means that
we never see snow and this
year has been tough on our
sports facilities. The badmin-
ton team have to play in the
Great Hall, the basketball
team play in Brixton and the
waterpolo team only have a
20m paddling pool at their
disposal. In these training
conditions, the skill and cour-
age that our teams displayed
was exemplary!
It was with this sense of
achievement that we spent
our remaining days enjoy-
ing some of the best snow in
the world this season, forg-
ing relationships not only
with the other universities,
but also amongst ourselves.
Special thanks must go to
ETH Zurich for putting on
such a great event and espe-
cially the snow sports day,
where we partied to cheesy
music and got to experience
skiing, snowboarding, air
boards, snow skates and snow
bikes before being escorted
by cable car to the moun-
taintop restaurant for fondue
madness and prizes.
I’d also like to thank Neil
Mosely and Grant Danskine of
the College Sport and Leisure
Department for organis-
ing the Imperial teams and
funding the cost of getting
there. They were a pleasure
to work with (and drink with!)
although if I never have to
hear Grant snore again I shall
die a happy man.
I’d like to congratulate the
overall tournament winner
Jonas Emmanuel Trecenti
Gomes, 24, the goalkeeper in
waterpolo for ETH Zurich. As
a truly international student
he received the big cowbell
for the ETH team; he was
born in Brazil, did an intern-
ship at RWTH Aachen, and
is now studying Mechanical
Engineering at ETH. I hope
that some of our competi-
tors take up the opportunity
to continue studying at these
institutions once they finish at
Imperial, although they had
better not compete against us
if they do.
Finally I’d like to thank
our competitors, who proved
themselves to be true ambas-
sadors of Imperial College.
If you would like to know
more about getting involved
in sport at Imperial and pos-
sibly joining any of Imperial
College Union’s 60+ sports
clubs, please get in touch
with Richard Walker, the
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies) at dpcs@ic.ac.uk.
