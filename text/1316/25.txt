Wye Men’s 1st 48
Reading Agrics
Men’s 1st 0
By Richard Stratton and
James Anderson
With five minutes to go
before kick-off, two Reading
boys were arrested following
the previous night’s antics.
Charlie, Nick and Henry were
good sports and agreed to
play for the opposition so we
could play full XVs.
The first half was evenly
matched, with both sides
putting up solid defence and
running cutting lines. Fresher
Andy, playing at full back,
was excellent in support play
and was always keeping our
defence tight.
The Wye pack dominated
the first half with great for-
ward play and tactical pos-
session rugby. Art Tukker and
Mike ‘Hunt’ West were always
on hand for a crash ball, while
flankers Freddie and Henry
were awesome in open play,
picking up loose ball and anni-
hilating the Reading fly half.
Fresher Sam, Angus Doe,
Leo and Adam from Essex
ensured we won our line-out
as Art found his new role as
part-time thrower.
The deadlock was broken
towards the end of the first
half, when yet more forward
ingenuity allowed Henry to
slide over for the first try. The
half time whistle blew with
the Wye Boys yearning for
more as Reading skulked off
the pitch to lick their wounds.
The second half was a dif-
ferent story. We turned on our
physicality as Wye’s superior
fitness, strength and abil-
ity shone through. Trehane
ran like an ostrich through
the Reading defence, scor-
ing two tries. A lovely switch
move orchestrated by Ando
at fly half saw Paul Lau score
under the posts. Manos and
George were too pacy for
their opposite numbers, both
scoring some well-deserved
tries, including a cheeky chip
and chase from George. The
blood bath continued as Ando
scored in the corner, before
slotting over some great con-
versions and missing two
shockers.
Overall it was a brilliant
performance from Wye, which
Readingweresimplyunableto
answer. Special mention must
go to Adam from Essex, who,
hooking for the first time, had
an absolute stormer and was
an easy choice for the man
of the match award. Another
special mention should go to
Adam from Watford, whose
blistering pace, usually asso-
ciated with pikeyball, was put
to good use on the wing. The
pack, led by our very own
Flying Dutchman, put in a
Trojan performance, out-
pushing, out-jumping and for
once out-thinking the opposi-
tion. The call for bail came
a bit too late for Reading as
they missed their players who
were on lockdown.
Perhaps a redeeming fea-
ture of these convicts was
that they managed to knock
down an entire wall in our
Union. Let’s just say the Wye
Boys are looking forward to
being let loose in Reading
for some proper agricultural
demolition!
RUGBY
Convicts’ XV trounced
Head of the Nene
By Ben Anstiss
There are some who would
question the academic bene-
fits of rowing, but, as I proved
at the Southside pub quiz a
few weeks ago, it is invaluable.
The answer to the question
“Through which major city
does the river Nene flow?” is,
in fact, “Peterborough” (but
my team still came third).
And that’s where Imperial
College Boat Club headed on
Saturday 5 February, to com-
pete at the Head of the Nene.
The competition was split
into three divisions: pairs/
singles, fours and eights,
raced at different times dur-
ing the day. The first two
divisions raced over a 2.5km
course, with the third divi-
sion (eights) traversing 4km.
These divisions were split
into categories of novice, sen-
ior and elite. Novice rowers
are those who haven’t won
any regattas yet. Each regat-
ta win earns one point, with
senior classes being num-
bered from 4 to 1, reflecting
the number of points allowed
in each crew (paradoxically,
these numbers run in reverse
– for example, senior 4 means
a maximum of one point per
rower, senior 3 two points
etc). Elite is for those amaz-
ing people who win lots of
races.
Three rowers were entered
in the single sculls category,
with Ollie Mahony finishing
second in open novice and
14th overall, Helen Ellison
winning in the women’s sen-
ior 2, and Sanna Supponen
coming fourth in the same
race just 19 seconds behind
her. This event was run with
the doubles and pairs cat-
egory, a total of 116 compet-
ing crews. Imperial took the
top four places in the open
elite coxless pairs compe-
tition (which were also the
top three times overall), with
further 1st, 3rd, 4th and 6th
places in the senior 2 coxless
pairs.
The second division was
fours, both coxed and coxless.
Imperial raced two coxed and
two coxless men’s fours and
one women’s senior 3 coxed
four. The coxless fours, rac-
ing in the elite category, came
first and second both in their
category and overall, with
only eight seconds separating
them. The senior 2 coxed four
won their competition eas-
ily, coming sixth overall. The
senior 3 coxed four came sec-
ond, losing out by just seven
seconds to the eventual win-
ners, despite overtaking four
crews during their race and
placing 13th overall. The real
success story was the wom-
en’s four, who not only came
first in their category (21st
overall) but also beat every
other women’s four, both
coxed and coxless in every
other competition! It was a
great result all round.
The third and final division
was the eights, an opportunity
for the novices and the senior
women’s squad to flaunt their
stuff. The women’s squad nar-
rowly lost out on first place to
Nottingham University Boat
Club by just four seconds,
but the result shows great
promise for the upcoming
Women’s Head of the River
at the start of March. The
men’s novice crews really
stepped up to the challenge,
with the ‘A’ crew winning the
open novices by 22 seconds,
and the ‘B’ crew less than
two minutes behind, cox-box
failure notwithstanding!
After some frantic de-rig-
ging and boat loading (mainly
inordertogetthetrainbackin
time for the England v Wales
rugby match - the unfortunate
result needs no discussion), it
was back to London for cel-
ebrations. It was also Andy
Horsfall’s birthday, meaning
that the alcohol flowed thick
and fast, mainly in his direc-
tion. Kudos to the angry little
ginger man, who managed
to turn up to training at 8am
on Sunday morning. There
are a few more races coming
up this month, followed by
the huge Men’s and Women’s
Head of the River races on
the Thames in March.

“Where the hell is the River Nene?”

Imperial Men’s 2nd 62
Holloway Men’s 1st 61
By Robert Boland
You may have noticed in
the Results section of last
week’s Felix that the men’s
basketball team lost to Royal
Holloway in the ULU league.
This is where we claim it was
all part of the masterplan.
Having lost to them in the
league, the determination to
beat Holloway in the cup was
stronger then ever. Playing
them only three days after
losing may not have given us
much preparation time, but if
there’s one thing you can say
about Imperial students, it’s
that they learn fast.
Knowing how they play,
we knew who he had to look
out for and how they were
going to attack us. Despite
the intensity we came out
with, they began knowing
they could beat us. In much
the same way as the match
the previous Friday, Holloway
attacked and pushed us back.
A disappointing score of 13-22
at the end of the first quarter
meant we had to grit our teeth
and start pushing forward.
A clever tactical change
from our coach gave us the
push we needed. By changing
to an adapted 3-2 zone, we
stopped their shooters and it
was now up to us to make the
most of it. Our chances came
and we should have been up
entering half time, if only we
could finish them off. The
shots weren’t dropping for us.
Despite this, we refused to let
Holloway score and ended up
winning the quarter 10-6. Half
time score 23-28.
Encouraged by the change
in fortunes, we started the
third quarter with all guns
blazing. Half time shooting
practice seemed to have
worked as the shots started
to drop. Our defence held
strong despite improved
efforts on their part. As
the bench and the support
roared their encouragement,
we pushed forward and the
quarter was a magnificent
contest. Winning it 25-17, we
entered the last quarter with
a 3 point lead. One quarter
to go and we would be in the
semi-finals!
The final quarter was as
tense as you would imagine.
Both teams knew how impor-
tant it was and gave it eve-
rything they had. Fouls flew
in and three players ended
up being fouled out of the
game. The teams exchanged
baskets for the duration of the
quarter until it came down to
the last ten seconds of the
match.
These ten seconds seemed
to last a lifetime. The ball
in our possession, Royal
Holloway did what they had
to and fouled us until they had
a chance to take the ball back.
Their chance did eventually
come, but with the strength
of our defence they were left
with only one second to take
their shot. An off-balance
fadeaway just wasn’t good
enough and the men’s ‘sec-
ond’ team took home victory.
It was an incredible win,
leaving the second team in the
semi-finals and two matches
away from the trophy.
