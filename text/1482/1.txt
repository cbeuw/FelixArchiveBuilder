£940
million
cut in
funding
Universities
hit by huge
reductions in
2011/12, plus
additional cuts
this year
Sophia David
University funding for teaching and re-
search is to be cut by £940 million for
the 2011-12 academic year, a decision
described as “a challenging financial
settlement” by the chief executive of
the Higher Education Funding Council
for England (Hefce) which announced
the cuts last week. Universities will also
receive £190m less than they had antici-
pated for this academic year (2010-11),
as an in-year cut is announced for the
first time.

publicly acknowledge plans to charge
students the maximum fee level al-
lowed, starting 2012.
The revelations became public after an
internal report by Cambridge’s working
group on fees was leaked. The report as-
serts that it would be ‘fiscally irresponsi-
ble’ for the University to charge any less
than the maximum £9,000 and insists
that even at this fee level, the institution
might experience financial predicaments
as the university would be ‘carrying the
burden of a significant loss per student’.
Prior to the MPs’ decision to vote in
favour of higher education spending
cuts last year, it was made clear in the
House of Commons that Universities
would only be allowed to charge £9,000
under ‘exceptional circumstances’. Nat-
urally, after reviewing this, the findings
of the report have come as a big shock
to many as they make it ruthlessly plain
