Last Saturday the IC Gaelic Football
team recorded their first win of the sea-
son away against Cambridge.
Playing against a stiff diagonal breeze,
Imperial knew that resistance would be
the order of play for the first half. How-
ever, some cutting runs forward by Ed-
die Fitzpatrick and Donal Connolly
were boosted by sterling defending from
old hands Ed O’Hare and Andy Lavery
and man-of-the-match William Seez,
and Imperial soon found themselves
enjoying the majority of the possession
in front of the Cambridge posts. Some
lapses in concentration led to some
well-taken points and two easy goals for
Cambridge.
A potential third was blocked at short
range by keeper Harry Evans and in
spite of the strong wind his deep kick-
outs found their way to Sean Dunne and
Eddie Fitz who recorded a goal and two
points between them in the first half.
Dunne eventually picked up the three-
pointer after continuously beating his
man to the ball. A flurry of goalmouth
scrambles around John McGuckin were
eventually cleared leaving Imperial
trailing by four points at half-time on a
score-line of 2-3 to 1-2.
The second half started well for Im-
perial with midfield duo Finian McCann
and Donal Connolly combining to win
the throw-in. With the wind at their
backs, Imperial really began to move
the ball quickly into Dunne and Conn
O’Rourke with Dunne starting the scor-
ing for the half with a goal and a point.
Cambridge briefly held possession near
the Imperial end before McCann re-
ceived the ball just inside the Cambridge
half to duly launch the ball over the bar
from fifty-five yards. With O’Hare, Lav-
ery, Ben Ryder and debutant James Sha-
nahan blunting the Cambridge attack,
Imperial had now found a comfortable
rhythm as Dunne, Connolly and Mike
White scored points. A fortuitous goal
from Fitzpatrick was followed by an-
other from O’Hare off the back of some
powerful forward drives. Cambridge
struck back however against the run of
play to smash home a goal off the cross-
bar and then another barely two minutes
later. With ten minutes remaining the
score stood at 4-7 to 4-3 in favour of
Imperial as Cambridge looked ready to
cause an upset.
Be that as it was, Imperial dug deep
and half-time addition Francis O’Neill
made some great runs forward from
full back to let the midfield diamond
of O’Hare, McCann, Connolly and Fitz
control the remainder of the match, re-
inforced by the muscle of Seez. After a
long burst from McCann and a beauti-
fully curled point from the boot of Fitz-
patrick, IC were replied to by a final
score for Cambridge. After intercept-
ing and dispossessing a string of short
Cambridge kickouts, Imperial killed off
the game with points for McCann and
O’Rourke and yet another major from
Sean Dunne, leaving the final score Im-
perial 5-11 (26 points) Cambridge 4-4
(16 points).
The very encouraging display from
the Boys in (darker) Blue was celebrated
to the tune of the finest ‘odes to’ along-
side much cider and flowing champagne
after the victory.
