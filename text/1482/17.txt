COMMENT
B
efore even thinking about
the ‘special’ Valentine’s
Day edition of Felix I can,
with a certainty of about
99.99% say that we will
be reading loads of complaints about it
being just another one of those capital-
ist holidays. I both agree and disagree
with this – Valentine’s Day shouldn’t be
a ‘holiday’– especially since I happen to
dislike chocolates. You should show the
people you care for that you do so every
day of the year.
The last two Valentine’s Days are the
only ones I can still remember quite
well and both were spent with my best
friend(s). One of them was visiting me
in London back in 2009 and last year I
went home for a gig by one of my fa-
vourite ex-Yugo rock bands. You see,
Valentine’s Day is no special thing in
that part of the world – it happens to be
just another day in February that comes
and goes just like any other. You get the
odd western fanatic that celebrates it
with his girlfriend as a “tribute of their
love”, but in reality, those same people
break up less than a month after (and
then get back together again, only to
Matt Colvin
break up yet another time…gosh, make
up your minds!).
Moreover, heart-shaped chocolate boxes
and flowers are not sold more on the
14th of February than on any other day.
I also still haven’t noticed the clichéd
red roses being delivered everywhere I
go (nevertheless, these happen to be my
favourite flowers).
Now, I did not always live in Sarajevo
and you all know what happens when
you start digging up your shoebox of
primary school memories – the best and
worst (read: most embarrassing) stories
come up. The same thing happened this
time when I dug up a folded red heart
shaped “Secret Valentine’s Day” card I
happened to receive when I was 7.
Back then, I was in 2nd grade of an El-
ementary School near Boston and well,
our teacher thought it would be amusing
to assign us all to be someone’s secret
Valentine. She told each of us to make a
creative gift or card for a certain person.
I still remember being seated on the floor
and Ms Quillen handing out each of our
gifts to the designated valentine. Once
she’d hand it out, she’d reveal to us the
name of our Secret Valentine. My name
came up and in a matter of seconds I was
holding the biggest heart-shaped card
with “You are my Valentine” written in
white childish writing on the outside and
the classical love poem inside:
Roses are Red,
Violets are Blue,
This Valentine may supposedly be
secret,
But I truly do love you.
And alas, to top that, my crush happened
to be the one whose hands made that
card. He had deep blue eyes and excep-
tionally white teeth – something I ad-
mire up to this day. He was a bit chubby
– but we all know how cute that can be.
I think my cheeks turned as red as that
card (it certainly felt so).
Anyways, back to the point – Valen-
tine’s happens to be just another day of
the year and if you do happen to want
to share a special day with someone you
love – friend, boyfriend, girlfriend, fam-
ily member or pet, don’t hesitate to do
so. Maybe they might write an article
in Felix 14 years after wondering where
you happen to be in the world.
T
he tabloids and I, we’ve
had a chequered past to
say the least. I grew up on
a diet of the Daily Mail,
yet it wasn’t until the mer-
its of secondary education that I real-
ised what I was fervently devouring
wasn’t exactly all that wholesome. As
I began to write more and more, some-
thing clicked. The whinging, the con-
stant references to burdened taxpayers,
the preference for introspective scandal
rather than global issues. Bias pervad-
ed in the language, and it really didn’t
taste very good.
Yet still I read on. But now, I wasn’t
furthering my knowledge about the
latest figures on immigration, nay,
not even the cancer risks from writing
weighty comment pieces on Word 2003.
It was about my criticism of journalistic
attitudes, the lack of cited sources, the
opinionated letters with bad attitudes.
Subsequently I grew up and stopped,
settling down with the infinitely more
friendly local news. Finally, I had got
out of the game.
Then everything changed. The Daily
Mail’s exposure of Imperial’s wild ways
in combination with the sudden trend of
comedians taking potshots at Mail read-
ers peaked my curiosity in the standards
of tabloids today. It was time to lay my
Naida Dzigal
demons to rest once and for all. It was
time to return to the newsagents.
The front page of the Mail. A size-
able photo of Pete Doherty and his latest
misdemeanours dominate proceedings.
Then I find it, in the miniscule column
to the bottom left, “Bloodbath on streets
of Cairo”. Flicking through the pages, I
get the feeling that a great deal of mean-
ness remains. Physical imperfections of
female celebrities are pored over, grisly
fox attacks packaged with gory images
in full technicolour. Outwardly, the pa-
per’s a morally upstanding citizen, yet
inside it’s filthy minded. Ah, here we
are, “CAMEL WARRIORS IN BAT-
TLE OF CAIRO”.
Seriously, what’s next? Shootout at
the Great Pyramid? Aquatic pursuit on
the Nile? The potential to form a tenu-
ous link with Egypt for the benefit of
readers is endless! My venture back to
the Mail left me disappointed. I was no
more critical of it than I had been. I had
to go deeper. Beyond DiCaprio, if you
like. I needed The Sun.
Like a 9 year old sycophantic school-
boy who’s just discovered naughty
words, The Sun uneasily mixes sensa-
tionalist and populist stories with out-
ward political allegiance. Raoul Moat
dominates the front cover, for some rea-
son.A‘pal’of Mel Gibson reveals his in-
nermost thoughts. David Camer– whoa,
an article on cider branding! Look out
ladies; they’re bringing out pear cider
especially for your delicate taste buds!
Sorry, it even suckered me in. I can’t
find any other word to describe it but
propaganda; the simplistic language, the
well documented history of switching
political support. Printed letters praise
the Coalition to the skies. Someone sug-
gests Jeremy Clarkson would be better
as Prime Minister. I cry inside.
Because that’s what genuinely wor-
ries me. While the Mail has a dedicated
core readership with unchanging tradi-
tionalist values, it’s people like Rupert
Murdoch, owner of The Sun and a bevy
of other publications, who can easily
mould the opinions of so many readers.
At least I can rest back into the warm
embrace of local news when it all gets
too much. Whereas I might have had to
deal with secret perverts and schoolchil-
dren in the past, forever fixated on the
negative, local papers are like a trip to
a kindly elderly relative, where I know
I’m going to get a hot drink and a slice of
homemade cake. One headline tells me
that, “LOCAL JOURNALISTS VISIT
SCHOOL TO HELP WRITE PUNCHY
HEADLINES”. Aw, bless ‘em. They
might not get it right all the time, but my
word, they care.
Falling out of love with tabloids
“My name came
up and in a matter
of seconds I was
holding the biggest
heart-shaped card.”
Five reasons girls
should ask guys out
for a change
Puppy love. No, not that kind
1. Imperial man syndrome.
A guy having the nerve to ask
you out doesn’t necessarily
mean that he’s ‘brave’. It could
equally mean that he’s an arro-
gant arsehole. I know loads of
guys who would probably treat
you better than the drunk jock–
type that just reused a ‘never
that good in the first place’
chat-up line on you. They’re just
too nervous to ask you.
2. Equality.
You, rightly, demand equal pay
and for the right to have kids
without your job suffering. You
also expect to be asked out
all the time and have your din-
ners paid for. Feminist it is not.
You’re paid decently now, so
you can (in theory) afford that
swanky meal.
3. Share the burden.
Getting rejected sucks, whether
you know the person, or you
take a chance on a good–look-
ing guy dancing near you on a
Friday night. Either way, when
they give you that awkward look
and make a good/bad excuse,
or simply tell the truth, you want
to bury your head in a tub of
Haagen-Dazs. I know I’m not ex-
actly selling it, but think about
how many times the average
man (if they have the nerve in
the first place) go through that.
Letting them do it alone bor-
ders on cruelty. So share the
burden – ask him out.
4. Don’t wait around.
Okay, so you’re waiting for a
guy to ask you out. What if he’s
not your type? What if none of
them are? You’re going to get
really, really bored. By letting
the men do the asking all the
time, you’re effectively leaving it
up to fate – you’re leaving it up
to someone who’s right for you
to rock up and ask you. Does
that really sound sensible to
you? Take back some control
and you may be a lot happier.
5. Pave the way.
Starting off on a more equal
footing when you’re dating
could mean that you get treat-
ed more as an equal in your
relationship, widely thought
to be a sign of relationship
health and success. Men can
also find women who take the
initiative more attractive, which
doesn’t hurt either.
