too low. Perhaps the
take on our part was
differing numbers of
ether (the combined
of the separate 1, 2,
resolution restricted
nalysis.
In addition to this, the results are
skewed in a number of noticeable ways.
Firstly, the respondents are precisely
those students comfortable enough to
discuss their sexual lives after having
used their College username to unlock
our survey. Perhaps such uninhibited stu-
dents have more active sexual lives than
their unsurveyed colleagues. While we
tried to promote the survey widely, the
somewhat skewed number of 3rd and 4th
year respondents indicates that a signifi-
cant number are part of the wider social
network of Felix Editors. Additionally, our
participation was limited to 562 students,
with individual departments providing any-
thing from 11 to 104 responses. Those
with smaller sample sizes are self-evi-
dently less generally representative.
As a final disclaimer, every attempt was
made to weed out nonsensical responses.
15% are still virgins. Around 50% of respondents ad-
mitted to watching porn at least once a week and 26
adventurous students identified as straight but admit-
ted that they had slept with a member of the same
sex.
10% said that they have engaged in a threesome
and the vast majority rejected the idea that studying
at Imperial had restricted their sex life. However, one
poor student commented: “Boys NEVER hit on me
here! Literally, the better I look, the more they run
away. I get the most attention when I look a bit rub-
bish. They need to MAN-UP!”
The results are, admittedly, a mixed bag. While the
data is not wholly unrepresentative, it is not strong
enough to indicate anything other than certain trends.
They also sadly don’t offer any quick fixes for stagnat-
ing sex lives. If you transferred to the Maths Depart-
ment, for instance, you would be just as likely to have
a year-long dry spell as daily multiplication exercises.

So who are the biggest wankers? The Materials De-
partment are well in front with 73% of their students
masturbating daily or a few times a week (regularly).
However, due to the low number of respondents there,
the potential for error is quite high. Mech Eng, by con-
trast, is a much more stable sample. 70% of their stu-
dents masturbate regularly, compared with only 36%
in the Life Sciences Department – perhaps due to the
greater percentage of female students. The trend sup-
ports the idea that women masturbate less, as de-
partments with more females lie low in the spectrum.
Incredible though it may seem, the Mathematicians
place third in our survey for frequency of sexual ac-
tivity. In fact, their Department has the highest per-
centage of students who claim to have sex daily. By
contrast, almost 50% of students in Aero and EEE
are either virgins or engage in sexual activity only
a few times a year. While almost a third of Imperial
students claim to have engaged in anal sex, this
figure rises to nearly 50% among Chemists. In the
breakdown by year group, PhD students and current
3rd years are the most experienced in this area.

“I lost my virginity to a girl and a
guy in the same night. one in a car,
the other in the woods.”
“[I attended a] 27 all-male orgy
hosted by an ex-TV presenter. One
of the most incredible experiences
of my life – and another ‘thing to do
before I die’ checked off the list.”
“My first sexual partner exploited
me and I haven’t had sex with
anyone since because I don’t trust
them to not do it again.”
