sponsored by Handball: Close call for the
Eagles as they manage to
fend off rivals UCL
There was not a single moment of calm in the
game that would determine the top seed in the
London division of the Handball Development
League.
It was already the 5th time that UCL and Im-
perial have met on the handball court on a com-
petitive level, but not even the infamous 9:7
victory for IC in 2010 was as closely contested
as last weekend’s game. In fact, the tension was
so obvious, that even our Spanish line-player,
Ignacio Vasquez-Garcia, managed to be on
time for a game for the first time this season.
In an act of provocation, the UCL-based girls
playing for the two rivals’ joint women’s team
came to support their university’s players, de-
spite that fact that they train with Imperial, but
soon changed their ‘loyalties’ in favour of the
more attractive side.
The game was off to a good start for Imperial
as Lucas Carstens, inspired by the fact that his
Danish countrymen had reached the Handball
World Cup final the day before, found the back
of the net with a rocket of a shot in the first
minute. However, UCL appeared not to be in-
timidated and even managed to take the lead in
the early stages of the game.
The Eagles’ solid 5-1 defence, with an ever-
so-agile Roberto Galli fighting for every ball,
kept the visitors from South Ken in the game.
Untypically, though, it was the attacking de-
partment that appeared to have trouble getting
into the game. ‘Incroyable’ was Thibault Her-
vier’s response when asked to comment about
the missed chances in front of the opponent’s
goal, which was, in all fairness, guarded by a
real goalkeeper this time.
When the referee blew the half time whistle
(the only right call that baboon made all day)
the Imperial Eagles were trailing by 3 goals.
The interval gave every member of the team
time to reflect on an intense 30 minutes and
offered an opportunity to have some rather
bruised digits taped for Hugh Ronzani, who
was brave enough to play on.
Tobias Gierk displayed impressive relent-
lessness in attack and was keen to induce
some rhythm into the game by coordinating
IC’s clever, yet largely unsuccessful schemes,
which did prove difficult in a heated match like
this. As a matter of fact, the aforementioned
primate of a referee made things worse by
demonstrating a unique lack of vision com-
bined with spectacularly poor understanding
of the game’s rules. His decisions intensely
infuriated our president and right-back Kolja
Ortmann, who let off some steam on the court
by scoring an impressive goal with an under-
arm shot that almost saw the UCL keeper jump
out of the way.
With Juan Avila-Anton making his debut
for the Imperial Eagles and David Müller-Wi-
esner brining some fresh legs onto the court,
the team made sure to stay within 4 goals of
their rivals, and eventually go ahead towards
the end of the game. No one expected the hosts
to surrender easily though – and they surely
didn’t! UCL gathered all the energy they had
left and tirelessly fired shot after shot at Stefan
Bauer’s goal. However, IC’s number one and
most capped player was equal to almost every-
thing that came his way on this day and, once
again, played a crucial role in a fixture against
this site.
With merely 90 seconds to go, Imperial was
3 goals ahead and could smell the sweet scent
of victory when Mike Capper, who had signifi-
cantly increased his season-scoring-tally in the
first half of the game, found himself in a prom-
ising shooting position. After his potentially
decisive shot came off the post the team lost
focus on 2 occasions, which handed their oppo-
nent a chance to even draw the game in the last
moments. Fortunately, an ill-timed pass handed
possession over to the guests again, who then
made no mistake and secured those valuable 2
league points.
Player 14 has had a strong season, he’s really bounced back from those sex scandals

Rugby: First team earn hard fought
victory in dying seconds of the game

Imperial 1s 24-21 Kent University 1s
Captain Charlie Esberger barged over for a try
in the penultimate play of the match to rescue a
result for Imperial who appeared to be heading
for a second loss in a row after letting a two try
lead slip.
Imperial were looking to bounce back last
weeks shock defeat to Chichester and started
the match brightly with the forwards provid-
ing good ball for the backs to attack out wide.
Whilst man of the match, Louie Barnett pre-
vented certain Kent try with a last man tackle.
Discipline still remains a problem amongst the
team, with penalties allowing Kent to gain ter-
ritory and cancelling out Imperial’s hard work
in attack. Imperial went ahead with a try from
Thomas Chavas who protected the ball at the
tail of a driving maul off a lineout.. Despite of-
fering threat, Imperial could not build on their
lead and lax defending allowed Kent to level
just before the break.
Imperial took the game to their visitors after
half time and went ahead with tries from Simon
Fenton and a second from Chavas, following
good carries from Ed Labinski, Jamie Aldridge
and Sean Baker. Kent old boy, Ben Adubi,
combined well with his partner at centre, Joe
Harris, and the back three of Barnett, Nathan
Fitzpatrick, Jack Judd and his replacement Jack
Newton ran good strong lines whilst the half
backs of James Hayward and Olly Cox pro-
duced a solid platform to work off. Substitute
veteran prop, Callum O’Rourke, added further
strength in the scrum and the loose as the game
wore on.
Complacency seeped into Imperial’s game
allowing Kent back in but the team showed its
determination and grit to come back and snatch
a victory from the jaws of defeat.
