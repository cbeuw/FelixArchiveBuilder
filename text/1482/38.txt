programmed and seriously
misinformed robot
Islam is a religi0n 0f peace which is why
there are is never wars 0r vi0lence in Islam-
ic c0untries. Islam is unfairily p0rtrayed 0n
in the media because 0f a small min0ritity
wh0 g0 bl0wing stuff up c0z they are called
extremists because they are extremely an-
gry. If you are write an article ab0ut Islam
then y0u will m0st likely get bl0wed up by
a extremeist because y0u are n0t all0wed
t0 write ab0ut Islam because 0f that is n0t
all0wed!!!!!! If y0u even think ab0ut their
prophet (THE BIG M-DAWG) then y0u will
get bl0wed up because y0u are disgracer-
ing their religi0n and that is n0t all0wed.
If y0u are ever g0ing t0 write ab0ut Islam
then make sure y0u are make it extremerly
well-researched and unbiased and there is
a chance y0u will n0t get bl0wed up unless
y0u are a w0man because y0u will always
get bl0wed up because y0u are a w0man.

Hangman’s Guide
to Valentine’s Day
Any Imperial male with a good work-
ing knowledge of MatLab will know
the horrifying cold sweat that a day like
Valentine’s Day can generate. It is truly
the most repulsive day of the year; fol-
lowed in close second by Remembrance
Day – how do you think people with
Alzheimer’s feel!?!? But never fear my
fellow virgins, Hangman has a step-by-
step guide to staying sane this Monday
the 14th of February. (To be completely
clear, I say “fellow virgins”, but, with-
out being arrogant, Hangman is getting
‘it’ like a fat guy gets Chicken Cottage:
whenever he damned well pleases, all
day, all night.)
Pretend it’s not happening.
This is your standard level, “first line of
defence” against feeling inadequate and
lonely on Valentine’s Day. Pretend that
there’s nothing special or unusual about
the day. Hey, the 14th of February is just
another Monday! There’s absolutely no
reason why you should be reminded of
the fact that you’ve been at university
for 3 years and you’re yet to wake up to
a girl smiling at you. No, Monday is all
about 9am lectures, doing some
lab work and pos- sibly head-
ing to the Union where you
totally won’t see any of
the girls that you’ve
secretly fan- cied
for as long as you’ve known them…
Because they’ll all be on dates… With
tall, hot, cool guys… Damn, this isn’t
working.
Make a point of doing something RE-
ALLY un-Valentinesy (Ed – that’s not
a word, douchebag)
Ok, we’re going to take things to the
next level. Sure, the 14th of February
might be a special day, but that doesn’t
mean that you have to buy in to the cor-
porate schmaltz and desperately find a
girl to love and cherish you. Why can’t
you just do guy stuff? Yeh! Why the hell
not? Grab some beers and plop down on
the sofa and play GranTurbo DeathCon
20 on the X-PS-Wii or some shit. Ex-
cept everytime you die, your character
takes off ‘his’ suit and is revealed to be
a mega hot babe. Damn women! Is there
no escape?!?
Fine! Let’s try and get ‘one’.
Here we go, avoidance is pretty spineless
right? You’re going to tackle this prob-
lem head-on. Valentine’s Day is your
day brother! You’re going to embrace
it, and CONQUER IT. You da man! All
right, we’re going to keep things sim-
ple. You’re going to ask a casual female
acquaintance if she wants to go to the
cinema on Valentine’s Day. BUT (here’s
the trick), you lie and tell her that other
people are coming as well. BOOM! You
ready? Go over and ask her. What’s the
problem? You’ve pissed yourself? FOR
FUCKS SAKE.
Go home and cry.
I give up. There’s no hope for you. Just
stay in bed and crank until you’re sore.
Yes, you can use Facebook to stalk all
the girls you like. No, don’t comment on
the profile pictures that particularly get
you off. Yes, maybe it’s a good thing;
you’ll get some work done. No, please,
please don’t jerk off to your coursewo…
fuck it, I really don’t care. I’m going to
go find some Indian girls (hangman.
felix@imperial.ac.uk *wink wink).
That’s it. Die Valentine’s Day. Die!
