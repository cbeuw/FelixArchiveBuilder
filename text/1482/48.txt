IC 1st 4 - 0 RUMS 1st
A tight fixture schedule meant that the
match between the 1st XI squads of Im-
perial and RUMS was to be played as a
double header, with the result counting
for both the ULU League, and Cup quar-
ter final. The squad was in a confident
mood however, being unbeaten in the
league, and knowing that a win would
take them to the top of the table for the
first time in the season.
Given their opponent’s position to-
wards the foot of the table, Imperial
opted for an aggressive three-five-two
formation. This very nearly produced
a goal in the opening exchanges of the
match, with Robinson firing a low cross
to strike partner Eshun, who rattled the
post with an audacious first-time effort
from the edge of the box.
This set the tone for the rest of the
first half, and Imperial didn’t have to
wait long for an opener, with Eshun
doing well to control and then convert
Beswetherick’s cross, in a crowded pen-
alty area. Imperial continued to domi-
nate proceedings, with the back three
seemingly untroubled by the occasional
RUMS long ball. Five minutes before
the break, the lead was doubled when a
delicate, if wind assisted, through ball
from Benincasa found Robinson, who
kept his head to coolly finish the one on
one.
With the very real chance that posi-
tions at the top of the league will be de-
cided on goal difference, the emphasis at
half-time was placed on maintaining the
intensity of the first half, and the squad
was determined not to repeat the previ-
ous week’s feat of squandering a two
goal lead. No such luck for RUMS how-
