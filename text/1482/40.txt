Ahoy mates, battleships is here for fans of pirate
based logic. You have to fit all of the ships to the
right into the grid, with one piece taking up one
square (so the biggest ship takes up four squares
in a row, either vertically or horizontally). The
numbers outside the grid indicate how many piec-
es of ship are in that row or column. Ships are
not allowed to touch, not even diagonally.Some
squares have been filled in for you, with waves of
the sea where there definitely is no ship.
