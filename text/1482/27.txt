As those at NME continue to ruin the minds of the musically naïve,
enforcing their ‘law-of-music’, their live shows give us hope
The New Musical Express, perhaps
better known as the NME, may have
lost some of its influence since it was
championing the Beatles and Roll-
ing Stones. The invasion of the in-
ternet has certainly chipped away at
print media’s appeal, and perhaps one
could argue that music hacks have
been one of the worst hit. However
the NME’s portfolio has expanded,
and since 1999 they have been giving
out some gongs to some bands for be-
ing the best, the worst and the most
villainous. Awards shows may also be
looked upon with a spoonful of cyni-
cism; as purely masseurs for overin-
flated rockstar egos. Don’t hold that
notion against the celebratory gigs
that are happening right here in the
capital throughout February, in the
build up to the big event on the 23rd.
It all kicked off with Metronomy at
Heaven, who have tentatively started
rearing their heads in the run up to the
release of what could potentially be
one of the albums of the year. The next
day saw performance by punk legends
Gang of Four and also bright indie up-
starts Los Campesinos.
But to the future! Aside from gigs by
New Musical Express
White Lies, Miles Kane, The Bee’s,
Noah and the Whale, Yuck, Warpa-
int, and someone who used to be in the
Libertines, there are some other gigs to
you should know about:
Isobel Cambel’s ongoing project
with Mark Lanegan (a man with a voice
so gravelly he could grit roads), returns
back to the UK once more with their
show at Shepherds Bush on the 15th.
Expect twee americana that is often
compared to Nancy Sinatra and Lee
Hazlewood. While Isobel and Marks
alliance may seem unlikely, or even un-
holy, their folk musings are well worth
a listen.
If Sonic Youth had a bastard child
with Dinosaur Junior, then it might
well have been Yuck. A band that loves
a bit of flange (…in an effect pedal con-
text, you filthy people) and clipping the
shit out of their distortion boxes they
are causing some teenage riots at Bush
Hall on the 18th. They will be joined by
Cults, a band where you can search for
melody under a cascade of noise
It was always going to be tough re-
viewing a gig for the band that is headlin-
ing our own music night (19.02 @Metric,
Saturday 19th February). I am pleased to
Vetoes
EP Launch @ The Social
7th February, 2011
Greg Power
say that any concerns I might have had
about reviewing Vetoes’ performance
were thwarted as soon as the band hit the
stage of The Social, among a room full of
friends, family and fans for the launch of
their debut EP Ritalin/Ritalout.
Giving out the EP for free was a great
touch for one, but more importantly their
music speaks lengths about the musical
talent and far-reaching ambitions of the
band. As much as I enjoy the post-punk
guitars and sing-along choruses of EP
tracks such as “Melting Clocks”, it is
their new material that really gets me ex-
cited. Far more adventurous in nature and
skirting into experimental, unclassifiable
genre-bending territory, the tracks played
at The Social for the first time ever re-
vealed the expansiveness of Vetoes’tech-
nical skills, as well as their love for al-
ternating uplifting melodies with all-out
cock-rock spazz attacks. These guys are
on to something very special indeed and
their fan-base will without a doubt keep
growing fast if they keep writing tunes
like these. Catch them at 19.02, before
they hit the big time!
We might have mentioned our favor-
ite musical alumni before, and we wont
hesitate to mention him again. Caribou
returns to London, no doubt remind us
why his album ‘Swim’ was one of the
finest releases of 2010. He plays on the
22nd, a fine way to close , that is un-
less you’d rather go for a bit more post
hardcore in which case its is Les Savy
Fav you should be seeing at Heaven.
Christopher Walmsley
Yucking awesome!
