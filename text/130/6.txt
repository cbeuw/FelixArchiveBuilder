FEUX
SlG RIDES AGAIN *
The well-known Chinese idiot, Lo
Slung once made the very wise remark:
"There i s a ohink in every Chinaman's
armour". This is true, of oourse, but
there is a brighter side, as the monkey ^*
said when he looked in the mirror.
M
The Chinese contribution to culture, I
whioh I skimmed over last week i s l i t t l e
known to the Western .mind. To the West,
the greatness of China ia measured by
the fame of her dynasties ; Thus, me
have the majestio Tang, the powerful
King and the intolerable Pong.
This Pong, which spread wherever
the Trade Winds blew, struck terror into
the hearts of mediaeval sanitary inspect-
ors from Bankok to Mandalay.
I wish to refer to this period in
particular, for i t is at this time that
gravity was invented by the wise and
nauseating Emperor Wun Long Fling. He
wished to do a kindly act every day,
although the best thing he could have
done, he refused to do on the grounds
that i t was too painful.
Eventually he ran out of ideas - at
least on some subjects and called a l l
the wise men of china (and of glass) to
come and make public postulations before
him. Those that refused, and some did
so, mainly on hygienic grounds, he
treated meroifully, which was a dreadful
way to die. Eventually, this same Lo
Slung of whom I have before spoken, came
before His Most Munificent Majesty and
decided that he liked chop suey too
much to give up easily.
"Postulate" said H
M
M
M
. After a slight
pause, Lo said:"Consider worms, sire"
"Warms?"
"Worms"
"Hum" said H
M
M
M
. "Proceed" (He did'nt get
it either)
"Well, you think of a worm travelling
happily through the soil, suppose the
poor creature, who thinks that he is
travelling in the direction of UP, is
in fact travelling in the Direction of
Down. Eventually, of course, the poor
animal will go mad. If you wish to be
a real M.M, surely you could do some
thing for the poor things."
And so the Emperor issued an ediot
abolishing gravity. When they had
a l l come down off the ceiling, and Lo
Slung was beginning to feel a bit out
up, the entire court found themselves
up to the knees in worms, a l l proceed-
ing in the general direction of Up.
This problem became too annoying,
and to r i d himself of the Annelid
Aggrevators, the Emperor?»ras forced to
call out the 4th,Imperial Anti-worm
Regiment of Boot. See next issue

JAZZ CLUB
At the beginning of this term the
Jazz Club found itself without a
President, a sad thing as this meant
that i t had lost a certain Mr. Dennis
Leston. The amount of work which Mr
Leston put into the Club was probably
not fully appreciated, but his interest,
enthusiasm and leadership sparked off
an upward trend in club affairs whioh
has continued steadily ever since.
This term has shown continued
success. The good audiences at Thurs-
day record recitals show that there is
a large number of people in the College
who are seriously interested in jazz.
Apart from these, many people, who have
only a l i t t l e interest in the music,
have been seen to know what the club
is doing. As usual groups are in
great demand far Saturday night hops.
Talks given so far this term have
been under the titles of 'O.D.J.B. to
M.J.Q.' (Tony Brookes), 'HardBee',
(Richard Rushton), and 'Listening to
Modem Jazz' (Stan Salmons). A Bring-
your-own-raoards type of programme
produced a wide range of music and
was well attended. Talks in line
for future meetings include 'Count
Basis' by Dave Hills, 'Dave Brubeok1
by Stan Salmons, and possibly 'Louis
Armstrong' by Gordon Pritohard. A
lunch hour concert will be produced
later this term.
This term has unfortunately seen
the decline of the 'Trad band', (due
mainly to lack of interest on the part
of certain members), but the small
modern and mainstream groups are s t i l l
very active. Modern trios and quar-
tets have been providing music for
quiet listening and dancing at the hops
and as usual a small group of dedicated
jazzmen played their way through Guilds
Carnival until 6.00 in the morning.
A mainstream group under the lead-
ership of Tony Newstead has been entered
for the W
.
U
.
S
. Jazz Band Competition
organised by N.E.C. After the prelim-
inary judging the bandsmen have mixed
ideas about their chances of reaching
the final; anyone with an interest in
jazz and an ear for good musicianship
would have no doubts about giving the
band a place in the final, but the views
and standards of the judging panel were
so pathetioally naive as to be almost
unbelieveable. However, i f the band
does reach the final (whioh is being
judged by Ken Colyer (!) on the 25th
of this month) then i t is hoped that
a large number of supporters will also
be able to make the trip to N.E.C.
Meanwhile anyone who is interes-
ted in jazz music of any type, is i n -
vited to come along to our lunch-time
meeting in Room 208 of Guilds (second
floor).
EDITOR'S NOTE
The above report was written by
Gordon Pritohard. It is typical that
he omitted to mention that in fact he
has been elected as sucoessor to Dennis
Leston (at least, as far as jazz is
concerned). Gordon is a very well-
known figure around I.C. and where
there is Jazz, he is never far away
The success of jazz in this College
is due in no small way to the con-
sistent high standard of drumming which
provides the background to the hops,
jazz concerts and carnivals and reci-
tals around I.C.
