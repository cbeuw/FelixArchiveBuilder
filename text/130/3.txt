THROUGH A VJSirOJiS EYES
Whan a foreign student arrives at
the University of London, he i s im-
mediately struck by i t s international
character. This character probably
varies according to the College, bat
at the L.S.E.,.. for example, where I
have spent one ten*, students of the
Commonwealth rub shoulders with those
from the Continent and the oountrj.es
of Latin-America, to mention only a
few. Here, there is a source of
very worth-while contacts, which the
English students themselves must find
profitable.
Strikingly opposed to this Cos-
mopolitan atmosphere is the narrow
community of the College, which i s
the framework of student l i f e . In
the Continental University, social
contacts between the faculties are
reduced to a minimum, particularly
in the large towns - the students
scarcely know their professors, or
each other. The English solidarity,
way of thinking, and even form of
everyday l i f e exist only in the
specialised schools, such as the.
Polyteohnique, Centrals or the
Hautes Etudes Conaerciales.
In England, on the contrary,
the social activities of the Col-
lege are considerable. The students
are gouped i n extremely diversified
societies, whether they be re£*gi«os
political, geographical or athletic
this custom of, societies is certainly
very fruitful, for i t allows apaoplat
to group themselves according to their
tastes,-and develops the information as
well as mutual understanding. Debates
followed by a vote on the motion are
also a typical institution which has the
same end, and which has at the same time
the advantage of being an apprenticeship
for political l i f e !
The students' association benefit
from the support and collaboration of
nearly a l l the students: they have at
their disposal important material means,
which in the case of soicntifio college
such as I.C. may be very sizeable.
In France, the societies of the
Faculties have only a small influence,
and very weak means of action: they
prefer to form political syndicates,
from which heated disputes between the
different opinions emerge - and this
perhaps may be considered as another
type of initiation int- politics.
This intense social activity i s the
English University i s even more remark-
able as the Colleges there are less
specialised than the Ccjxti&antaJ. ones:
the latter base only aUtojforw- «f sub
jeers ^e.g. arts, leaf, OrTkalcine e t c )
But at the L.S.E., for instance, the
diversity of the syllabuses" is astonish-
ing, and ranges from psychology to
fiscal law with more than 600 regular
courses. After a brief stay,•I oan
hardly judge English teaching: my
impression, however, i s that i t is
quite practical, even pragaatie, and
very complete and thorough.
In judiciary and political econ-
omics, I can say that the contact was
carefully maintained between the acti-
vity and the corresponding social
milieus this is certainly a fruitful
method.
Bnfin, last but not least, the
foreign student always finds a supple-
mentary attraction in the generous and
cordial welcome which his London friends
keep for him.

MOTION
"That this House should ba
adjourned indefinitely.*
Last Thursday the House had the
pleasure of an excellent speech (a
maiden) from that hoary old batchelar
Dave Jackson. Proposing the motion,
he said: "If this House adjourned,
where would i t adjourn to? To the pub)
to drink beer." Whereupon he produced
three bottles of beer: one far the
chairman, one far his seconder, Peter
Jarnan, and one which he kept for him-
self. "I have something for the
opposition as well," he said, and duly
presented them with two bottles of
pineapple juice.
Mr. Christopher May, opposing the
notion, oarofully analysed the word
indefinitely. Mr. Peter Jarman, on
the other hand, subtely twisted the
motion with a most outrageous piece of
verbal Jiggery-pokery. This he supp-
orted with a somewhat tortuous argu-
ment, apparently involving the death
of George II from overstraining in a
Water Closet.
In view of Mr. Jarman'• dreadful
illogicality, Bob Finch, who was also
responsible far this utterly unbiased
report, had to light the gleaming
beacon of truth, in a brilliant(and
modest)oration.
(embers of tSf House aAla Sua
demonstrated that they could only
speak on a serious motion.
In his third summing up Mr.
Jarman finally succeeded in ex-
tinguishing Mr. Finch's beacon of
trhth, by employing unlimited numbers
of water closets and by declaring
that +>»- ~»»r meant that the
House would meet again frequently.
In view of this interpretation of
the action, and because i t was carried,
the Debates Committee graciously accepts
the verdict of the House, and is spurred
on to even greater enterprises.
Is connection with these enter-
prises the President of Debates wishes,
to deny rumours that he has been engaged.
upon twisting the arms of Messrs. Kasslezj
and Clark. He would like to point out,
however, -that the two presidents have
agreed to speak upon the motion:
"That this House prefers Thermometers
to Spanners," later this month.
BOB FINCH,
President of Debates.

CJUo-potuCd Meedie
There was a very poor.response to
the offer of psychi•+rio treatment and
advice given by '••llulk. It seems
that the students at I.C. are on the
whole content with their characters
and have only very minor problems.
WaTlwlk has kindly consented to help
the anxious ones in this column but
sas regrets that ah* i s unable to
enter into any further correspond-
ence.
"Of oourse I like my chicken
young, plump and tender, but this
one lays eggs."
REPLT: This is only natural and
there is no cause for anxiety. If
you send me a 5/- postal order and a
stamped addressed envelope, I will
send you in return a booklet advising
you.
Tet another male student ia wor-
ried,
"She said yes, what shall I do
now."
REPLT: Move into the Hostel.
There also seems to be some
disturbances in the minds of the
women at I.C. One young lady states,
"I'm worried about Jim. You'll
never guess what ha's been doing, I
suppose it's just what other boys do
but then I haven't really met a l l that
many you see, that i s since I met Jim,
He's ever so nice really, not as what
you'd call handsome or anything like
that but Just so attractive, you know
what I mean. Well I mean to say,
whan I'm Jrith ,h1a it's .ectaay,, I a l -
ways feel I'm actually walking on air,
quite makes me forget my high heeled
shoes have stretched. Anyway as I
was saying before I started to talk
about Jim, oan't help i t though, ay
friends are just the same about their
boyfriends, though they're ever so
jealous of me, going out with Jim I
mean, I'm worried. You see i t ' s
like this, at first i t was ever so
soft, but now i t almost wakes the
neighbours, because Jim who hardly
•war raises his voice, keeps culling
out in his sleep. Not that I mean ha
swears, Jim's quite curteous i s his
own way. Oh no, he shouts out this
woman's name, I know what you're
thinking, but it's not that, I know
because he's for ever tailing me I'm
the only woman in his l i f e . But I
do feel there must be some kind of
explanation, don't you.
REPLT: Tea ay dear, I do so agree
with you. As you might have found,
ass oan be so difficult i a their ac-
tions and thoughts. Some of the
things they do are quite inoxplainable
in our minds, and often lead to much
heartburn and anxiety. This i s main-
ly due to their large interest i n their
own person, and their failure to take
a small interest in other people. I
am afraid, though that beyond this, I
am unable to give you an explanation
about your situation because, ay dear
you have omitted to tell as the wa«.
aan's nam*.
