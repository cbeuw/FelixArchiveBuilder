Dear Sir,
I oannot understand,those who
condemn The Phoenix merely because
articles are written for i t by the few
people with any literary ability. The
fact whioh i s overlooked i s that one
of the functions of the Phoenix i s to
act as an outlet for the creative
talents of members of the Union. If
only a few show any sign of possessing
any creative talents are they to be
blamed for doing so?
I feel that many of the grumblers
are just jealous of the Phoenix Board.
Those people who oannot even write de-
cent English are harbouring a childish
resentment towards those who can, and
do, write good literature (doea the cap
f i t , Mr. Bramley?) They even go so
far as to demand an Editorial which
does not reflect any character on the
part of the Editor. Let's go the whole
hog and have one of Prof. Gabor's com-
puters editing Phoenix!
But you yourself, sir, have dropped
the brick of the year by printing that
rubbishy cartoon by "Mao" (is he ashamed
to reveal his identity?) in the same
issue as an accusation of "bad taste"
against The Phoenix. There is a say-
ing about a pot and a kettle....
Tours faithfully,
ANTHONY b BROOKES.
Editor's comment: Sir, i f I could
always get such talented work as Mao has
given me for the last few issues, I
would have no difficulty i n f i l l i n g
these columns. The Phoenix people, in
particular David Irving were very much
in favour of that cartoon, and wished
that Mao had done i t for them .
1 would like to point out that my
position demands that I remain neutral,
by presenting views from a l l angles. I
do feel, howveer, that more than suffic-
ient Space has been given to the Phoenix
problem and a l l correspondence on this
topic i s closed.
There i s also a annotation about "A
tale told by an idiot".
A new Musical Play, by
ALAN & AVRIL LEWIS,
will be presented by the Dramatic Society
on 28th., 29th., and 50th APRIL in the
Union Concert Hall.
BLEEDING HEART
Dear Sir,
Since you have not yet (for
shame) instituted a "personal column"
in your publication, I must make use of
your correspondence space to pour out my
heart's misery to a third person. .If,
therefore, this epistle mystifies you,
pray comfort yourself that there will
be, among your readers, one fair soul
to whom my meaning will' be as clear as
the light of day. While providing an
additional activity for the student,
whose naturally inquisitive mind
delights in the dark mysteries of her
friends private lives. Let me explain:
I, too, am preoccupied with mystery, and,
alas, with irony. Imagine, i f you will,
the strange excitement of a succession
of disturbing encounters with an angelic
apparition. To say that she was
attractive would be commonplace, rather
she wore about her that aura of subtle
magnetism that i s at once vivacious
and demure, that rare amalgam of mature
wickedness and virginal innocence.
Wherever I went she haunted me:
the sudden direct look from those spark-
ling eyes that flashed across the crow-
ded lounge, the secretive half smile
that touched the generous mouth, on
the taut silent journey in the l i f t .
Who was she, my mystery girl?
I could bear the strain no longer,
I had to know her identity. I dared to
ask, and the spell was broken, the dream
a memory. Try as I might to recapture the
first magical t h r i l l , i t remained elusive.
The encounters ceased. I was lost and
alone in a crowd of "insensitive louts*
Yet, even into the abyss of despair
there came, light (was i t the quality of
mercy that follows contrition?) In a
trembling flash of Paradise, she appear-
ed before me, (no, in truth, i t was be-
hind me) and through"! the thunder in my
ears, the dulcet sweet tones in tender
inquiry: "What i s your Wallulk rating?"
Avidly, I thumbed my Felix, In
perplexity. I permutated points against
descriptions, questions against points.
How risque i s a risque story? Why do my
omelettes always-finish up as scrambled
egg? Oh, how I cursed those protestations
of eternal bachelorhood. Surely i t was
possible to be unutterably charming with-
out being unbearably conceited. It was
no good, I should haveto seek advice,
sympathy, understanding. Find out who
Cleopatra was and put the problem in
her hands, that was the answer. It
was not easy - for she dung to her
cloak of anonymity, but determination
brought success. I found her, and in an
instant my problem was solved. Little
wonder at the elusive attraction, the
fatal charm of my my3teiy girl, for
she was a practised witch: under "her
spell had fallen a Caesar, and a Mark
Anthony and, of course as you know, sir,
a Felix.
Incurable Romantic.
LOST PROPERTY
MRS. BCBB has asked the Editor of
Felix to publicise the fact that she has
umpteen items of lost property i n her
Union Office. These include, she Informs
me - scarves, gloves, compacts, lipsticks
purses, eto.
Perhaps somethinchbelonging to you
is i s waiting there, why not go along
and see?.

ON AHy TEAMS
A reward la o f f e r e d for inform-
ation leading to the arrest of Eddy
Current, charged with the induction of
an eighteen-year-old coil, called
MillA Henry, found half choked, and
with the theft of valuable joules.
This unreotified criminal, armed
with a oarbon rod, escaped from Weston
Primary cell, where he had been clap-
ped in ions. The escape was planned
in three phases. First he fused the
electrolytes; he then dim Dad through
a grid, despite the impedance of the
warders, and finally ran to earth i n
a nearby magnetic field. He has been
missing since Faraday.
Watt seems most likely i s that
he stole an A.C. motor. This i s of
a low capacity and he is expeoted to
change i t for a megacycle and to return
ohm by a short circuit, he may offer
series resistance, and i s a potential
killer.

UNLIKELY STORIES
KRIBBER
There was once a kitten called
Fred. It was called Fred because its
father's name was John and i t was a
girl kitten anyhow. Fred was unhappy
'cos she had no letters after her name,
so one day she went out to collect some.
The policeman was very sympathetic but
charged herall the same 'cos he missed
the B.C. from his collar. The judge
Q.C. was not impressed when he found
W.C. missing from behind the CO. so he
sentenced her to a course at I.C. where
she could be educated. But I.C. only
trained Scientists and so i t was not
surprising that she took the M.C. from
a U.C. Hop. However, this M.C. was
U.C. and he took away to Peweey where
she died of cronary thrombsis.
