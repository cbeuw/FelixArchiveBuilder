were runners-up to Guy's Hospital
(15 pta. ) in the Blott Gup.
I.C. eon, P. Sribibadah and H.L.

and featherweight titles respectively.
At light-welter both I.C. repre-
sentatives were outpointed by D. Tayloi
(St. Thomas' Hospital); D. Whitely in
a semi-final and G. Yorke ± a the final.
0. Maltby was beaten in the light-
middleweight final, and P. Vine lost
narrowly on points in a light-heavyweighl
eliminator bout.
A match against Guy's Hospital was
held on Friday, 6th February in the I.C.I
Gymnasium, resulting in a draw (3 bouts
each).
Kirplani outpointed M. Reeve (Guy' a)
at»featherweight, and Yorke stopped E.
Chater i n the first round of a light-
weight bout.
Welterweights D. Faulkner and L.
Williams lost on points after courageous
displays. Faulkner often hurt the ex-
perienced P. Leopard with fine left hooks
but had no punch to follow. Williams
could not keep away a stronger, and
considerably heavier, opponent, but
used Ms straijtit left intelligently.
At middle-weight T. Banks could
not land his hard right effectively
against a skilful opponent, and the
referee stopped the bout (3rd round)
because Banks was too tired to con-
tinue. However P. Vine, I.<j. light-
heavy, bemad strongly and oooly to
outpoint his opponent and square tne
match.

FENCING
There have been the usual can-
cellations in our fixture l i s t so
that the match with L.S.E. on Friday

This was a closely fought match with
most of the bouts going to assault
points and i t resulted in a fair draw,
I.C. 9, L.S.E. 9. The detailed re-
sults were:-
SQUASH
The highlight of the Squash Club's
year hss been the first team tour during
the last weekend of January.
A streamlined programme was planned,
playing Manchester university on the
Thursday, Queens University Belfast an
Saturday and Dublin university on the
Monday.
The team consisted of C.R. Evans,
B.W.E. Avient, P.M. Ode 11, H.R. Espig and
R. Lloyd.
The programme was extremely ambit-
ious and all three teams were known to
be strong, but i t was considered justif-
ied since the team waa unbeaten daring-
the Christmas Term.
In fact a l l three matches were
lost to superior opposition, including
several county standard players.
Outstanding performances were those
of Odell who won in both Belfast and
Dublin, and Evans who lost narxotty to
the Ulster No.2 in Belfast.
The tour was a great suooess
socially and a particularly pleasant
evening was spent in Belfast, the Capt.
performing an amazing feat of prestidig-
itation before a large student audienoe
and the Secretary H " E a collection
"for the clown*.
The pilgrimage to the country of
the Guinness and the "Lord Stiff" waa
also greatly enjoyed by all and on the
evening after the last match the two
teams managed to consume over seven
gallons in two hours before the last
mad rush for the boat train to Holy-
head.
The experience gained on the tour
has since proved invaluable, and the
1st. v" remains unbeaten against London
aides and also against Oxford and Camb-
ridge. The closest matches so far this
term have been gainst a strong Middle-
sex Hospital side and Kabie Co_lege, Ox-
ford, who included an Oxford 2nd. team
player. Both these matches were won 3:2*
The second team is greatly improved
this term and is settling down into a
strong combination.

D30KING FOR A NEW GAME I
BOXING
BASKET BALL
Despite the fact that i t was so
soon after Christmas, Imperial College
retained l i t t l e of "Goodwill towards
men" when handi ng out a severe thrashing
to Northern Polytechnic Never troubled
in any aspect of play the College, in
f u l l oommand, piled up a good lead.
(H.T. 30-10) In the second half, due to
an injury sustained by D. Packer (who
attended hospital for treatment), the
College team was reduced to four players
but s t i l l continued to over power the
opposition finally winning by 60 points -
34 points (J. Fryer scored 26 points)
to clock up the first win of 1959.
The following week scheduled to
play Goldsmiths' College, the game was
regarded as a mere formality (having
beatenthem with both 1 st and 2nd teams
last year). Our impressions were
aorne, for never extended Imperial
won by 51 points - 34 points. One of
last year'a olosest league games was
against the London School of Eoomomios.
The return was not as good, although
Parker celebrated his return to the
team with a cultured 15 points.
So far this season the battle for
leading points scorer has developed into
a personal duel between the Captain -
J. Fryer and the Coach - M. Barron.
(Both totals being around the 200
mark). Although newcomers to the first
team'D. Parker and D. Wiekenden have
settled in well, and A. Hind (at right
guard) in spite of not being a pro-
l i f i c scorer has proved the staltwart
of the defence.
