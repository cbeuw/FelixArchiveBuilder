GARNETT; HELP TO MAKE IT
A SUCCESS
T H E C A R N I V A L
On Saturday, Hay 9th, the Annual
W.U.S. Carnival will again he held in
the grounds of Bedford College. It has
already been decided that the Carnival
should consist of a Float Procession
through the West End (with Police per-
mission) and a Garden Fete involving
stalls, sideshows, performances by
jazzbands etc., and a fancy dress com-
petitions.
W.U.S. have given their permission
for the Carnival to be organised by the
B.L.U. Executive, and this is a move to
erase memories of an organised chaos,
and the first decision has been that the
Carnival should have a theme; namely,

Last year, far the first time, the
I.C. Union made a determined effort to
outdo a l l the other London Colleges, and
we succeeded. 'Consequently, the Union
is again gearing itself for the coming
event, which provides an excellent op-
portunity to really show the rest of
the University exactly what I.C. oan do
- not only on the sports field, but in
other spheres.
Details will be announced both at
the I.C. Union Meeting and at Constitu-
ent College Union Meetings, and W.U.S. -
Carnival Committees are being formed in
order to complete the detailed prepara-
tions. These will be represented on
an I.C. Union W.U.S. - Carnival Commit-
tee under the^ chairmanship of Mioh—J
Newson, the U.L.U. Rep. to make this
Carnival amthwrt Imperial College
success.

The success of the I.C. contribu-
tion in the forthcoming W.U.S. Carnival
ties in with another plan which I shall
now outline. The comment has often
been made that I.C. Union does nothing
for charity. Although this is not
strictly correct I have been of the
opinion for several months past that we
could certainly do more. Consequently,
St. George's Hospital has been contacted
with view to endowing an Imperial Col-
lege Bed in that hospital. This would
cost approximately £1,000 or the equi-
valent spread over several years.
Naturally, w
e cannot afford to write
out a cheque for this amount, and, i n
addition, i t would not mean a great
deal. ^
The L.C. Union will therefore
organise, commencing i n the Summer term
of 1960, an Annual Garden Party and
Fete. The object will be to raise
money to endow a bed in St. George's
Hospital, as outlined above, and the
Fete will be held, with the permission
of the Rector, in Princes Gardens.
The idea is not to raise a l l the money
from the students but from local resi-
dents and shopkeepers etc. This will
commence on a Monday, and the fete will
be held on the Saturday afternoon of
the same week, concluding with a dance
in the evening.
Although the College 'vehicles'
will be on the road, this will NOT be
another Field Cup Day, nor a Rag Day,
but will be an I.C. Fete, and for once
we shall know the exact destination of
the money that we raise. I shall very
soon be contacting the Presidents of
other Colleges and universities i n
this country i n order to benefit from
their experience, but this does not
mean that I do not want your ideas.
Anyone with experience of such an
event, or with ideas, however small,
is invaluable i f this venture i s to be
a success.

The death of Mr. F
.
W
. James on the
26th. of last month, at the untimely age
of 48, has deprived this college of a
well-known and liked figure. His loss
will be particularly felt by the over-
seas students, in whom he always took
a great interest.
Francis Wogan James came to the
ICollege in 1230, on a Royal Scholarship
from Haverford West. He graduated i n
-Chemistry i n 1933* In 1936, he became
Research Assistant in Highway Engineer-
ing.
He was of the opinion, however,
that he could be of mare use as an
interpreter of other peoples work and
applied for the post of Assistant
librarian. Within a short time, he was
Librarian of the Unwin Library.
In 1941, he joined the Army and
served in the RASC, RA0C and as Captain
in the RBME - he was especially ocnoerned
with eleotrioal circuits,and radar, in
particular.
Mr. James returned to the College
in 1946, to re-apply his great knowledge
and ability to interpret literature.
Since 1952, he has been the Treasurer
of the the A.C.C. and since October,
1958, he was the Chief Librarian of the
College i n charge of a l l the individual
libraries.
U N I O N M E E T I N G
An Imperial College Union Meeting
i * to be held in the Concert Hall on
Thursday, February 24th. 1959.
A motion,for discussion at the
Union Meeting reads as follows:-
•This Union should commit the
mascots of the three constituent
colleges to a place of reverence and
safety, and that they should be left
there as a symbol of the hooliganism
of the past."
This promises to be a Union
Meeting well worth attending.
