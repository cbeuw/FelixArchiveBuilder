way, a different manifestation of despera-
tion: eroding tin plates and timber infra-
structures outlined one of Casablanca’s
most impoverished slums.
Along the seafront stood Hassan II
Mosque, boasted to be third-largest in
the world and pinnacle of Morocco’s
dedication to Islam. Challenging its splen-
dour was a strip of green situated on the
mosque’s very doorsteps, laden with com-
plex if-not-reckless mosaics of shattered
glass, its architects defiant drunks in their
acts of sacrilege.
This was, by no means, a lifestyle equal-
ly shared among Casablancans.
Come nightfall, and Abdellah and Su-
zanne retreated to their lounge for their
night-time entertainment. A hearty stew

was prepared from meat bought from the
local butcher, a traditional white-tiled af-
fair, a visit for them a rarity reserved for
special occasions and entertaining guests
given their mediocre salary. As we lazed
on couches, the local football match was
produced by their television, which was
thesizeofashoeboxandintermittedwith
signal disruption, and a spliff would be lit
and paused around – smoking cannabis
remains more socially acceptable than
the consumption of alcohol in Morocco,
as well as being the more economical op-
tion, despite its alleged illegal status.
Soufiane’s stereos were blabbing out
his House music, each a mix he had pro-
duced himself – he could afford the time
and cost of musical equipment. Bottles
of spirits littered across the table, swiftly
emptied in preparation for an intoxicated
night out at a club. His friends gradually
filed into the apartment and, equipped
with a good degree of English, joined in
the banter.
Later I would find out that, unani-
mously, they have all received university
education in France or Spain. Soufiane
himself spoke Moroccan Arabic, French,
Spanish and English fluently, as opposed
to Suzanne having to act as interpreter
for Abdellah, who was unschooled in
English.
When the booze supplies ran low we
relocated to the club Soufiane and his
mates were habitués of. The entrance
fee deprived us each of 200 dhs – the
equivalent, I recalled, of Abdellah’s and
Suzanne’s daily income. A last glance, al-
beit a drunken one, before entry exposed
the ranks of extravagant cars – not since
entering Morocco have I seen exhibitions
of vehicles that were not internally and
externally tattered.
Once inside, their garments, man-
nerisms, attitude confirmed what I had
anticipated of the club’s patrons: this is
where Casablanca’s upper class come to
play. Not merely a playground of leisure,
but practice of liberalism, sexuality, un-
bound by social limitations and religious
obligations.
For a society where drinking is frowned
upon, intimate male-female interaction
illicit, this venue – and no doubt similar
venues across the city – was riotous with
rebellious spirits.
But surely, scrutinising especially with
a Western mindset, this was progress?
Behind all the extravagance, all the
knowledge, all the flashy rides, all the
liberal lifestyle, only the rich may claim
possession to so-called progress. This
liberalism was to be purchased, most
often only available to those who were
fortunate enough to pop out of the right
wombs.
Whilst a minute proportion of Casa-
blancans could afford to aspire to pay

rises, designer-brand desirables, noctur-
nal outings of fervent alcoholism and
erotica, a disproportionate mass of slum-
dogs and proletariats could only aspire
to survive another day in unemployment
and poverty.
Some, stricken by idleness and des-
peration, resorted to extremism and the
promises to wealth it asserts to provide.
The terrorist attacks in 2003, a series of
explosions in Casablanca that claimed
45 lives, were conducted by bomb-
ers recruited from a slum on the city’s
outskirts.
The breakneck drive through ne-
glected roads, sparsely illuminated by
streetlamps, offered little remedy to my
alcohol-induced nausea. Soufiane’s friend
sped past yet another red light – his fifth,
I counted. Though I do ponder now, in
hindsight, what the purpose of his driving
fast was. Was it recklessness? Was it bra-
vado? Was it an eagerness to flaunt? Was
it an act of imitation? Or, the presump-
tion that discomforted me the most, was
it a declaration of wealth and status?
Tori and I waited in the vehicle as
Soufiane went to grab us a bite. Emerg-
ing from the shadows, the rugged man
approached and pleaded for char-
ity. Prompted, we bolted the doors and
sealed the windows. The barrier stands,
solid as that we had barricaded ourselves
behind. The barrier which partitioned
the poor from ever grasping the riches
Casablanca’s high-risers and modern fa-
çade represented.
Or rather, while the champions of elit-
ism karamu and fiesta behind closed
doors, have they segregated themselves
from those authentically Casablancan?
