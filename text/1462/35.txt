Hey guys it’s ‘Everybody Draw Mohammad
Day.’ I’ve uploaded mine to facebook. He’s
wearin Jeggings
It’s sort of like the news, but without the news. Crap, that’s the title
I
’ve decided that the news is
too boring. Volcanos, Bangkok
fights, murdered children - bor-
ing. Fret not, for I have found a
solution to our banal current
affairs. You simply look at the picture
from a news website of your choice
and make the story yourself! This is
pretty much what the News of the
World does anyway. All these pic-
tures are taken from various newspa-
pers on Wednesday 19th of May.
UPSIDE-DOWN
READING FOUND TO
BE THE NUMBER ONE
CAUSE OF DEPRESSION
IN THE UK
CHERYL COLE MEETS CHERYL COLE
AT MADAME TUSSAUDS
Cheryl Cole grinned next to her uncanny double at London’s famous museum of
celebrity waxworks, Madame Tussauds. “Way aye it’s propa’ mint, like, it looks
just like me an’ all” said our Cherry as her tiny brain tried to reassure herself that
she was the real one. A restraining order has been put on ex-hubby scumbag,
Ashley, who is not allowed within a mile’s radius of the museum. “We’re just
worried that he [Ashley] would try to fellate the waxwork” says Ben, the manager.
ORANGE MASCOT HAS
HISTORY OF CHILD ABUSE
They’ve only been with us for a day and one of them is already caus-
ing controversy. The recently launched mascots, Orangey and Bluey,
for the 2012 Olympic Games were meant to be insiprations for children,
but instead turned out to be investigations for the police. It was at a
promotional photoshoot at Rainbow Primary School in Hackney where
the scandal unravelled. A playground of silly poses and giggles soon
became a scene of sickening screams and cries of terror as Orangey re-
portedly lunged out at an unsuspecting ethnic child with horrific sexual
intentions. Luckily Bluey was quick to intervene and explained to his
paedophile brother that molesting children is not very polite. Desginers
of the mascots were deeply embarrassed by the situation, but insisted
they had not originally intended Orangey to be a paedophile. “We un-
derstand now that it probably wasn’t such a good idea, but we thought it
would give the character some depth”, said lead designer, Phillip Morris.
