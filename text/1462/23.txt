It‚Äôs all hush, hush in the Elgar
Room of the Royal Albert Hall
Tom Greany hears the Rural Albert Advantage, Anna Calvi and Peggy Sue.
Beauty in sound, delivered through accordions and a Survivor cover... Really?
L
ast week, I had the pleas-
ure of attending Hush
at the Royal Albert Hall.
Hush is a series of con-
certs every few months
featuring indie rock bands hosted in
the Elgar Room, formally a Victorian
restaurant that was recently trans-
formed into a performance space and
bar with capacity for 250 persons. It is
a surprisingly fun and intimate venue
in which to experience a concert; be
sure to try the hot dog. Jazz events
are also hosted in this room every few
weeks.
The first act was a Canadian band,
the Rural Albert Advantage. Some of
the Postal Service-like synth sounds
and rhythms present on their critically
acclaimed album, ‚ÄúHometowns‚Äù were
absent from this performance. In their
place was perhaps something more
powerful, an energetic performance
centred around frontman Paul Ban-
watt‚Äôs acoustic guitar that conveyed
a genuine yearning for simplicity and
wilderness, fitting for a band based
in Toronto but named for a western
prarie province, that left this author
yearning for the simplicity and down-
home comfort of the New World. Of
note was vocalist Amy Cole‚Äôs percus-
sion and the Banwatt‚Äôs delivery of a
cover of ‚ÄúEye of the Tiger‚Äù, which can
be found on the band‚Äôs most recent
single.
Singer songwriter Anna Calvi, sort
of a female, highly attractive version
of Nick Cave, gave an excellent per-
formance successfully melding her
gorgeous electric guitar, mysterious
vocals, backup guitar and percussion
from Mally Harpaz and drumming
by Daniel Maiden-Wood. Musicol-
ogy expert and chemical engineer
Tomi Herceg was quoted as saying
that Calvi ‚Äúneeds to open her eyes
more while performing.‚Äù Particularly
intriguing was Calvi‚Äôs performance of
‚ÄúLove Won‚Äôt Be Leaving‚Äù, another per-
formance of which can be found on
YouTube.
Headlining act Peggy Sue turned
out to be slightly disappointing only
in that I had been expecting a Buddy
Holly and the Crickets tribute band.
When I learned that I was not in for an
hour of the sounds before rock started
‚Äúgoin‚Äô downhill‚Äù, according to John
Milner, the amount of time the band
took to setup led some audience mem-
bers, including myself, to believe that
we were in fact about to experience a
surprise appearance by the Bob Dylan
who, apparently like Peggy Sue, takes
a long time to set up. What instead
resulted was an hour minus setup time
of thoughtful and contemplative rock
that on second thought was broodish
and whiny. This shift in my humble
opinion did not occur perhaps until
the band whipped out its accordion, a
show of force that to me represented
the band‚Äôs attempt to appease or awe
the hipsters in the audience. The ac-
cordion in fact seemed to ruin what
could have been a perfectly fine song.
The band recently crossed 1.5 million
plays on MySpace, so perhaps the ac-
cordion is working. I should caveat
my displeasure in the band was not
because they are poor musicians; they
are excellent. Instead, I was lost in its
melancholy. Perhaps as a result, Peggy
Sue could appeal to many mechanical
engineers and other unsatisfied Impe-
rial students and staff.

I see an accordion... and a violin... and a double bass... So where are all these
electronic instruments everyone keeps raving about?
