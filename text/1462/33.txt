Draw a
loop around
each dot. Draw a
loop around each of those!
When loops are about to touch,
draw a loop around both! How
many distinct loops can you fit?

Winner: GLT - both puzzles. Some people have been complaining about this combination
puzzle, apparently they liked Slitherlink but don’t know how to do the Nonograms! Nonograms
are easier than Slitherlinks and we include a very helpful ‘How to Play’ section below...

How to play:
The numbers at the side represent the size and
order of blocks in each column and row. There
must be at least one space between each block.
Then insert the numbers from the box in the top
left corner into the unshaded cells and proceed
as for a normal ‘Slitherlink’:
All numbered cells must be surrounded by the
corresponding number of edges. The solution
consists of one continuous line. Any cells without
a number can have any number of edges.
See last issue’s solution (right) for more help.

Bridges 1,462
How to play:
Connect all the
‘islands’ together by
bridges running in
direct lines, North,
West, East and South
only, with no more
than two bridges
connecting any two
distinct islands.
Every island must
have a total number
of bridges from it
equal to the number
on the island and
bridges must not
cross islands, one
another or lead to
nowhere!
If you would like to design a puzzle and see it
printed in felix but don’t want to do one every
week, just send us your ideas to the usual place -
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk and if we like them
we’ll print them!
Last week’s winner was GLT well done.

Doodle
this box
into a
picture
of a farm
animal!
Do we
really
need to
explain?
It’s like
sudoku
but with
letters.
Start a stopwatch, complete the
maze, stop the stopwatch.
If you hit
a wall you
must start
over, but the
clock keeps
ticking...
