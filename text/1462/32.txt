Hugo De Groot: “Ignorance of certain subjects is a great part of wisdom.”
Music Quote
of the Week
Rant? Not
mine today
CharlieMurdoch Coffee Break Editor
Well done to GLT who seem to have
entered many of the puzzles this
week... and won. So well done to you.
Obviously a wee bit bored during revi-
son, I suggest you spend more time on
learning your shit and less time pissing
about here.
As always we can put a guest puzzle
in, so if you fancy your name in print
drop us an email at sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk
[Include a puzzle with your email or
we won’t bother with the ink.]
W
ell, it is revision time.
That is all I’ve had to
do this week. As a re-
sult, my column in now
complete. However, as it’s revision
time I’ve spent a lot of time engaging
in degree-worthy amounts of procras-
tination. This is genuine post I found
about a couple who met on a date
website.
“To the woman that crapped in
my car… (NE Portland). We met on
Craigslist so I am hoping that this post
finds you. I know that it could quite pos-
sibly be the most humiliating first date
that you have ever been on, but I am
willing to look past that. I thought we
had chemistry sitting at McMenamins
sharing that basket of Cajun Tots while
drinking the Terminator Stout. I really
felt like there was a connection there.
I found you to be intelligent and witty
and looked forward to further conver-
sation with you.
At some point in life, everyone has
gambled on a fart and lost. It just hap-
pened to be on a first date in the pas-
senger seat of my car. Please don’t feel
bad. The package I sent you with Pepto
the next day and the note that said
‘First dates are always a crap shoot.
Call me’ was meant to be funny, not
offensive.
I have gambled on a fart and lost
on multiple occasions. The first time
I did it was very memorable. It hap-
pened when I was five and sitting on
my uncle’s lap. I am lactose intolerant,
but love cheese. I probably win 95% of
the time, but I don’t think anyone wins
100% of the time. That’s why they call it
‘gambling’. I’m the last person to judge
you for crapping your pants. In fact, I
am impressed by your boldness. The
timing on the other hand, could have
been a tad bit better… like when you’re
not sitting on a heated leather seat…
What I am trying to say is that if you
want to go out again, I would be more
than happy to take you someplace
where we can get a meal that is high
in fibre and less taxing on the digestive
tract.
I await your call, Tad
P.S. - If you shat yourself on purpose to
end the evening early…Touché…

Wordpath 1,462
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW-> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS)
would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
ORIGIN:
E X A M
DESTINATION:
F A I L

Solution 1461
Arrow Maze 1,462
How to play:
Fill all the squares with numbers to form a path from 1 to 49, such that the arrow
under each number points to the square containing the number one greater
(except for 49 obviously, which has no arrow, being the end of the path).
Hints:
26 is pointed to by three arrows but only one of them is pointing only at 26, so
this square must be 25. The square immediately right of 4 is only pointing to one
square so can temporarily be labelled ‘A’ and the square it’s pointing to can be
labelled ‘A+1’. Now we no longer consider ‘A+1’ as a destination for other arrows.
