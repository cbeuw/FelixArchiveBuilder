Joanna Cai looks at how STEM subjects may bear the brunt of imminent funding cuts
Will university science suffer the most?
I
mpending cuts in public fund-
ing are likely to directly affect
Imperial College as whole, not
only in the Humanities Depart-
ment and the Medical School,
but in every subject area at Imperial.
This follows the recent cuts made in
the Imperial Humanities Department,
which resulted in the loss of beginner-
level language courses; lessons in Ara-
bic, Italian, Japanese and Russian were
also axed completely. The decision to
make these cuts was made last year,
with them coming into full effect at the
start of the next academic year.
In December 2009, Alistair Darling
announced in his pre-budget report
that universities and higher education
institutes would have to collectively
make £600m in savings.
A recent survey in the Financial
Times, which looked at around 40
UK higher education institutes, found
that a reduction in staff was planned
to take place in 16 departments for
STEM (science, technology, engineer-
ing and maths) subjects. These staff
cuts will be across the board, affecting
both academic and support staff, and
in some cases staff cuts have already
taken place this year.
According to the Higher Education
Funding Council for England (HE-
FCE), 99 out of 131 academic insti-
tutions are currently facing a drop in
funding from the government.
At a time of turbulent politics and
national deficit, STEM subjects will
inevitably be targeted because they
require expensive facilities and equip-
ment in teaching and research.
According to Richard Lambert, di-
rector general of CBI (Confederation
of the British Industry), “science sub-
jects are more expensive to teach than
arts subjects, but they are of huge value
to the economy”. It is feared that mak-
ing these funding cuts in a key poten-
tial workforce will hinder the British
economy from its recovery from the
recession, and will not help economic
growth. STEM subjects have previ-
ously been targeted by the government
for completely different reasons, and
with opposite intentions.
In the 2004 Budget, the government
published the consultation document
“Science & Innovation: working to-
wards a ten-year investment frame-
work”, supported by over 200 organi-
sations including Imperial College,
which set out to encourage the sciences
towards economic growth and public
services over 10 years, ending in 2014.
It seems that the unanticipated finan-
cial problems within the government
over the past 12 months have meant
that many aspects of scientific educa-
tion needs to suffer funding cuts. Gail
Cardew, from the Royal Institution of
department was wasting money.” De-
spite this so-called money wasting,
the King’s UCU Executive Committee
disagree with the decision to close the
engineering department, concerned
that King’s College has made a “short-
sighted decision that it will come to
regret later”.
We need not feel penalised for
studying sciences and engineering at
Imperial: it appears that regardless of
subject area, a reduction of up to 25
per cent in long-term funding for uni-
versities is expected in the near future.
According to an Imperial College
spokesperson, “Imperial is in a robust
financial situation.” Imperial have re-
duced all budgets by 5% for the cur-
rent financial year and postponed
the development of the new Exhi-
bition Road building. Rector Sir
Keith O’Nions was not terribly
disappointed with the fund-
ing allocations annouced in
March 2010, as he believes
that “universities with a criti-
cal mass of excellent inter-
disciplinary research groups
can continue to make im-
portant contributions to the
country’s health, quality of life
and economic competetiveness.”

Lib Dems concede fees pledge
Great Britain, an independent char-
ity dedicated to connecting people
within the world of science, claims: “By
2014 there will be more than 2m ex-
tra jobs which need STEM skills”, but
the current cuts facing STEM subjects
will not be able to provide this future
workforce.
However, action to downsize is not
always a result of government cuts.
King’s College have plans to close its
172-year-old engineering faculty, and
it cites competition as being the main
reason: “There are great engineer-
ing schools elsewhere in London. The
“STEM subjects
require expensive
facilities and
equipment”
A
s the new coalition gov-
ernment settles down
after the post-election
dealing and debat-
ing, one issue that still
isn’t clearly defined is that of higher
education.
Many have criticised what is per-
ceived to be a significant U-turn by
the Liberal Democrats with the re-
cent news that its MPs will be able to
abstain from voting in the House of
Commons on higher education should
they disagree with what is proposed.
The Lib Dems have been forced to
concede several of their high profile
election campaign promises, includ-
ing the gradual removal of tuition fees,
earned citizenship for illegal migrants
and the removal of the costly Trident
nuclear defence programme.
Despite some victories with regards
to political reform and a tentative
step towards a possible change in the
voting system, many Lib Dem voters,
especially those who have voted for
the first time this year, have been left
feeling short-changed at their lack of
pushing policies through the coalition,
especially regarding higher education.
This is an added blow to students
and academic groups following the
recent controversy surrounding the
Russell Group’s confidentiality in Lord
Browne’s review on higher education
fees. Crucially, the Browne Review, as
reported in last week’s felix, is likely to
heavily influence future policy on tui-
tion fees.
Should Lord Browne recommend
raising tuition fees, it is possible that
the Lib Dems will provide no oppos-
ing votes against the Conservatives in
favour of abstaining. Higher education
policy could therefore be entirely influ-
enced by the Conservative Party in the
future.
It is well documented that the Con-
servatives hold lifting the cap on tui-
tion fees in a favourable light.
Although the Lib Dem’s proposed £2
billion extra per year for higher edu-
cation was an unlikely proposal with
mass cuts required in spending across
government, the literal removal of the
Lib Dems from providing any real op-
position to their coalition partners
have angered supporters.
With the coalition government still
finding its feet and the conclusions
from the Browne Review approaching,
the issue of higher education is likely to
prove contentious in both government
and amongst the public as individual
policies begin to come under intense
scrutiny. - Matt Colvin
