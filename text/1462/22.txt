Rihanna’s
Reign @ the
O2 Arena
Mariam Zahedi isn’t
revising. Instead she
went to the O2 Arena
to see Pop’s other
crazy-fashioned diva,
with all elaborate sets
and aerial acrobatic
displays money can
buy.
Jack White takes more of a backseat
than ever before, bringing Alison
Mosshart to the helm of this spooky
yet sultry blues outfit. The album
kicks off with “Blue Blood Blues”;
with bass stomping all over it and
Fertita’s guitar shrieking in discord-
ant yelps. WTF ‘shake your hips like
battleships’ means I’m not quite
qualifiedtosay,allIknowis,itmoves
my bones. “Hustle and Cuss” sees
them slip into a more chilled groove
akin to 70s soul band Funkadelic,
which contrasts with the twisting
snake-like “The Difference Between
Us” driven by Fertita’s Hammond
organ and Lawrence’s bassline. It’s
notable that this album is a more
collaborative effort than their first
album, with White restricted to the
odd burst of showmanship, like his
distinctive guitar solo on “Gasoline”.
Whilst several tracks feel unrefined
and in need of trimming, the overall
result is impressive, and serious ku-
dos to them for finishing on a jaunty
graveyard theme. - Tom Jennings

ight now, the music in-
dustry really is all about
the girls. Whether you
love them or loathe them,
there’s no doubt that the
likes of Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Cheryl
Cole [Ed note: Cheryl Cole?] and co.
are taking over.
RiRi has come a long way since she
first exploded onto the scene with Pon
de Replay in 2005. Only 17 at the time,
the song showcased none of her pow-
erful vocal skills, the video was hor-
rendously lacking in style and fashion,
and, most importantly, you didn’t get
a sense of who Rihanna is. Make no
mistake – this girl is not your typical
pop princess, she’s wild, she’s dark,
she’s rebellious, and she does what-
ever the hell she wants to and doesn’t
give a toss about what you think about
it.
It may come as a surprise to those
who have seen her live performanc-
es on youtube, but not only can Ri-
hanna sing in tune, her voice is also
compelling and powerful. Starting
her set with the haunting Russian
Roulette, the song showcased not
only her vocal talents, but her love
of fashion too, with a black dress
covered in red flashing LED lights.
The set was comprised of all the
big hits from her last two albums,
as well as some of the lesser-known
songs from her latest.
Memorable moments included
her performance of ‘Hard’ on top
of a neon pink army tank, the mini-

rave she and her dancers had inside
a neon cube for ‘Please Don’t Stop
the Music’, and the emotional bal-
lads ‘Take a Bow’ and ‘Rehab’ where
one look at her face clearly showed
exactly who she was singing these
songs about.
Her costume changes ranged from
Lady Gaga-esque leotards to big
statement shoulders, asymmetrical
body suits to gem studded FMBs,
and her on-stage dancing and gener-
al behavior was at all times enthral-
ling – she was clearly having fun and
the crowd was having fun with her.
This is one girl who definitely de-
serves all the attention she’s getting.

KEANE/K’NAAN
STOP FOR A
MINUTE
UNIVERSAL
SINGLE
I thought I hated this song and then
it got stuck in my head and now it is
growing on me. Completely unlike
anything they have done before, it still
has the distinctive piano riffs but with
the added hip-hop vibe. It is definitely
more accessible than their previous ef-
forts and is very radio-friendly... AND
my burlesque teachers are in the vid-
eo! Ha.

Ronnie James Dio
The 16th of May was a very black sabbath indeed.
B
lack Sabbath ring any bells?
Rainbow? Well if they don’t
they should, and if they
do, then so should Ronnie
James Dio, the heavy metal legend
who fronted Rainbow and later Black
Sabbath post Ozzy Osbourne’s fool-
ish decision to leave. He died at the
age of 67 last Sunday from stomach
cancer, and will go down in history
for his contribution to rock, popu-
larizing the “devil’s horns” gesture,
that has kept rock n’ rollers moshing
and mere popstars shaking in their
spaceboots.
I can’t explain how much of a loss
this is to the music world. Dio, was
the metal behind Rainbow, leaving
the band in 1973 because, well... they
weren’t rock enough for him. He
joined Black Sabbath in 1979 hav-
ing been suggested by Sharon Os-
bourne (daughter of the Black Sab-
bath manager), and replaced Ozzy.
He gave the group a new energy and
force which led them to success and
a new attitude. He had a differnt style
to Ozzy, and would make the vocal part
his own, singing across the riffs rather
than along with them like Ozzy.
Dio later broke away from Black Sab-
bath and formed a band called ‘Dio’
with Sabbath drummer. Releasing ten
albums with his self-titled band and
Ronnie James Dio being the only con-
stant member throughout, he moved
on to form his current band, ‘Heaven
and Hell’, in 2006, with Tony Iommi,
Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice.
He was at the heart of the inter-
national metal family, with the well
known “devil’s horns” a trademark,
which he claims was to ward off evil
spirits, unfortunately the ‘evil spirits’
got to him before his time was up. His
wife announced his death stating; “To-
day my heart is broken, Ronnie passed
away at 7.45am 16th May. Many, many
friends and family were able to say their
private goodbyes before he peacefully
passed away. Ronnie knew how much
he was loved by all.”
Having a name meaning ‘God’ in
Italian and a cameo appearence in
Tenacious D’s film, “The Pick of Des-
tiny”, it was clear that he knew what
his purpose was on this Earth and
now, although he may be gone, his
role in the world of rock was epic, as
was he. -Luke Turner
