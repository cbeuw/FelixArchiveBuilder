A
fter their first loss of the
season against Brunel,
the 1st team were ready
to win against Surrey
and give themselves the
best chance of promotion at the end of
the season. After a long walk from the
station, the Surrey home ground was
reached. Winning the toss, Imperial
chose to bat first on a slow wicket.
Anirudh Sompalli held on to his first
over curse when, after smacking the
first ball for four, he sent the second
ball straight back to the bowler who
held onto a sharp catch to provide the
first blow.
In came Majid Ali with all guns blaz-
ing, playing brilliant drives and gener-
ally taking the game to Surrey despite
losing Matt Tarr soon after. Skipper
Ankit Patel came in, looking to play a
textbook captain’s innings and see the
team through to the end. After a good
partnership with the skipper, Ali fell
trying to clear the boundary at long
on, and an extra couple of wickets fell
in a hurry. Ahsaan Ismail and Patel re-
covered their balance and had a good
partnership as they held off an ener-
gised Surrey team. Eventually, both fell
trying to up the run rate after playing
themselves in, Ankit top-scoring with
43.
From there the team tried to make
most of the last 10 overs but kept los-
ing wickets regularly as they ended
up setting a target of 142 at the end of
their innings.
Even though they didn’t have a vast
total to defend, the Imperial bowlers
came in with good confidence since
they had seen from their own innings
that scoring runs on this slow wicket
was not easy. Navin Surtani and Singh
started their spells well and both got
a wicket as IC put the Surrey team
under pressure. Later on, both Ismail
and Sompalli bowled top spells, also
gaining a wicket apiece as the Surrey
team was reduced to four down. Un-
fortunately, the quick bowlers some-
what struggled to find rhythm on a
slow wicket where, bizarrely, they had
to lower their pace to get the most out
of the pitch. The Surrey batsmen were
accustomed to batting on their home
ground and were able to chase down
the rest of the runs without losing any
more wickets.
After winning three games in a row,
the Firsts have now lost the last two
games of the BUCS tournament and
promotion seems unlikely. However,
they still have the ULU league to look
forward to, starting this week.
****
After a long but generally uneventful
journey to Harlington, IC set about a
quick warm-up and survey of the skies
which gave uncertain results as to the
possibility of a complete game. None-
the-less, Imperial decided to bat first
on a bouncy but green track.
Openers Ben Bell and Rohan Babla
got Imperial off to a flyer, taking three
fours off the first eight balls. However,
this was a false sense of security: Babla
and Bell were bowled in consecutive
overs by well-disguised yorkers before
Anirudh Sompalli edged behind for a
golden duck. Once again, it was left
to Andy Payne to steady the ship (and
deal with some terrible sledging) with
Vinno Balakumarasingham also falling
cheaply. With some typically crunch-
ing blows and ill-advised heaves, good
partnerships with Bernard Pereira
and Adam Hugill were formed before
Payne lost concentration and ran him-
self out for 45, attempting a second run
that simply wasn’t there. Hugill (34)
and Ahsaan Ismail (30) continued to
attack the Holloway bowlers with well-
placed pulls and drives before both
falling in short succession as IC were
all out for 191.
Patchy bits of rain had punctuated
Imperial’s innings, but Royal Holloway
began their reply with everyone in high
hopes of getting in (at least) the nec-
essary 20 overs to constitute a result.
Ismail had the right-handed opener in
serious trouble right from the first ball
before Payne did everything but find
the outside edge of the left-hander.
The cat and mouse games continued
for the first 10 overs, with the batsmen
scoring well, until Payne managed to
induce an edge to the keeper from a
well-directed bouncer.
Unfortunately, after a couple of
threatening overs from captain Pete
Swallow, the rain started to get heavier
and the umpires called the players off.
Half an hour later it was still raining,
and both teams had to admit defeat to
the weather with the game an agonis-
ing six overs from completion.
A dedicated performance from Im-
perial bodes well for the remaining
ULU games, and they have a good
chance of a high finish if the weather
stays fair.
