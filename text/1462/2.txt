College goes green with CompPod
I
mperial is at last getting greener.
The aim is to reduce IC’s carbon
emissions by 20% of 2008/2009
levels by 2014, and I’m sure you
will have noticed the launch of
the StepChange campaign in April
as a driver of this change. This week,
two different initiatives got underway
to help cut waste in food outlets on
campus.
Reusable cups are now on sale in the
Junior and Senior Common Rooms
for just £2.50, which can be used when
buying hot drinks at any of the Col-
lege catering outlets. The cups must
be clean when they are presented to
Catering staff but as an incentive, cus-
tomers will be given two stamps on
their College loyalty card every time
they reuse their cup. This scheme is
the direct result of the consultation by
the StepChange campaign last month
when lots of people pointed to dispos-
able take-away cups as a culprit of un-
necessary waste.
Another project unveiled this week
is an on-campus composter which will
take one tonne of food waste from
food outlets every week, including all
of the hot food waste. The compost
will then be used on college grounds.
The CompPod which can be trans-
ported around to where it is needed,
is the size of a portacabin and contains
all the equipment necessary to treat
Rox Middleton
Rox Middleton and convert food waste to a compost
of a quality which satisfies the British
Standards Institution. It has been de-
veloped using research from the Col-
lege’s Department of Civil & Environ-
mental Engineering, and cost Imperial
£140,000 which, it is claimed, can be
recovered in just two years.
The research was led by Professor
Grimes who said it was “very satisfy-
ing to see our concept translate direct-
ly into a practical green solution here
on our own campus”. The CompPod
will contribute to the aim of reducing
rubbish sent to landfill by 40% during
2010 and will also save College money
on Landfill and transportation charg-
es. The Imperial College website does
not detail, however, the extra electric-
ity and water required to make the
composter work.
These measures are just two of the
multiple schemes being implemented
to change Imperial for the better, but
it’s slow progress. Monitoring systems
have also been put in place to meas-
ure energy expenditure and daylight
sensors are being used to reduce un-
necessary lighting which itself is
provided by low-energy bulbs.

Reported chemical spill at
Science Musuem
A
t midday on Thursday
(20th May), the police
and fire brigade were
called to Exhbition Road
to deal with a reported ‘chemical
spill’ at the Science Museum.
The Musuem was evacuated
quickly resulting in hundreds of
vistors embarking on Imperial Col-
lege’s campus.
For a short time, all cars were di-
verted away from Exhibition Road
at the junction to Prince Consort
Road. Pedestrian walkways remain
cordoned off surrounding the Sci-
ence Museum.
Police officers told passing stu-
dents that there was a substantial
chemical spill in the basement of
the Science Museum.
Firemen were seen to be putting
on special HazMat suits to tackle
the chemical-based accident.
The Museum was closed until
Friday after a reported three staff
and firemen were affected with ir-
ritation of the eyes. -DW
