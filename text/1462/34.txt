Winner last week was. Ah shit I can’t
remember. Maybe GLT? Basically I’ve
changed computers here and this cur-
rent machine doesn’t have excel so I
can’t access my league table. I could
walk over the other side of the office
and change computer, but quite frank-
ly I can’t be arsed. Suck it up, those
who entered did get some points.

Honour-scopes: Horoscopes scoops up the awards
We’ve worked bloody hard all year and for what? A red carpet and small golden naked men? Score!
Cancer
There’s something on
your face and it’s got
you worried. It wasn’t
there before. Oh
god, it’s not cancer,
is it? Quickly, you
take a kitchen knife to it and chop it off. As it
lands on the floor, you realise it was your nose.
Weak from embarrassment and blood loss, you
stumble out into Exhibition Road and get run
over by a taxi for Gordon Brown.
Virgo
You’re making a fry-
up and you’ve run
out of oil. Sainsbury’s
want £1.04 for
more. £1.04?!
That’s extortion!
Frustrated, you decide to make your own. You
don’t have any vegetables, sunflowers or olives
but you are surrounded by Imperial students.
You wring the Library dry, squeezing out every
last drop. You end up making Extra Virgin.
Gemini
In an ungodly experi-
ment in Blackett, you
succeed in summon-
ing yourself from a
parallel universe. You
rush forward to greet
your other self. Unfortunately, they mistake this
for a threat and rip out your heart in self-defence.
Turns out their universe has a gym. Finally, as
they begin to spoon your bloodied corpse you
wonder if this is gay or masturbation? It’s gay.
Pisces
To forget about
exams, you head to
Brighton for some fun
in sun. But when you
get there, it’s raining.
Feeling lonely, you
take a stroll along the beach. Suddenly, you see
a proper fit girl, out in the sea. A mermaid! She
winks at you. You follow her and have hot fishy
sex in the kelp. At first it’s great but then you
drown. Not so great.
Leo
You’re writing the
horoscopes in the felix
office when something
lands on your neck.
It’s a drop of Reggae
Reggae sauce. The
sports editor behind you is demolishing a whole
chicken. As he licks his fingers, finished, he sniffs
the air and smells your spicy goodness. You find
it hard to type with him slobbering all over your
neck. The nibbling is quite nice though...
Aries
You’re at the gym. Not
workingoutbutcheck-
ing out the totty on the
running machines.
You slip a crafty hand
down your shorts. In
your pervy exuberance, you overdo it and pass out.
It’s dark when you wake up. You don’t know where
you are but you’re chained to a radiator. A burly
man in a spandex one-piece called Hans begins to
stroke you. Apparently, you’re his wife now.
Scorpio
It’s past midnight. You’ve
been here for hours and
horoscopes still aren’t
done. The cleaner comes
in. You strike up conver-
sation, hoping to discov-
er a hidden philosopher or poet. He starts touching
himself. You say nothing. He starts touching you.
Taking this as a new form of avant-garde poetry, you
allow to continue. In the morning, he has taken your
eyes and you have hepatitis. Cat-hepatitis.
Libra
You’re taking the
District line home after
college when it breaks
down. You huff with
annoyance – you’re
missing Hollyoaks. The
other passengers have more pressing concerns.
What will they eat? You hands are dry and you
rub some cream in them. It smells like caramel.
The train is moving again in five minutes but
they’re already chewing on your kidneys.
Taurus
Aw, man, you love
curry! But nothing’s
hot enough. After
polishing off your
ninth vindaloo, you
decide to your own.
You pour some tabasco, jalapeno peppers and
Icelandic lava in the blender and turn it on. The
concoction is delicious! You wake up the next
morning and spend half an hour on the toilet.
You shit out your large intestine ON FIRE!
Capricorn
It’s a Friday night and
you’re at the Union.
You meet a hot, smart,
funny and, most
importantly, single girl.
You start talking to her
and really hit it off. She suggests going back to her’s
for some “coffee”...and then sex. You can’t believe
your luck and pinch yourself to wake up. It doesn’t
work. You pinch her instead to double-check. She
throws her pint in your face and walks off. Pint?
Aquarius
“OMG! This is liek
such a surprise,” you
cry with joy, “First of
all, I’d like to thank
the Academy, and my
mum whose always
been there for me and Jay-sus. Loves me some
Jay-sus! And I’d also like to thank...” As you
witter on, Kanye West leaps on stage and steals
the award of you. And then Chris Brown beats
you up.

Sagittarius
Revision has completely
screwed your sleep-wake
cycle. Day and night
mean nothing to you
and you can’t read your
watch through the tears
and blood. You’ve taken to measuring time by the
growth of your beard. It’s down to your nipples now
and small birds are nesting in it. That might mean
it’s Tuesday. Then you remember that you’re a girl.
Ugh! Girls hate beards!
