Privacy Paradigm Shift
Leaves Facebookers Open
Feroz Salam investigates whether you can really trust Facebook
O
n May 12th, the New York
Times published an info-
graphic (right) that would
have looked more at home
in a science textbook - their break-
down of Facebook’s privacy options.
The final count reached 50 settings
containing 170 options in total, rang-
ing from those related to the public
availability of your status updates to
those about who gets to see what you
“Like” and who doesn’t. Facebook’s
privacy policy is currently longer than
the United States constitution, and has
grown a massive 480% in the last five
years. Making sense of the tangle of
options and jargon is practically im-
possible, and unfortunately it seems
like Facebook might be banking on this
to sell your information for a profit. app I use on Facebook? Not so much.
It’s a problem that Facebook has had to
grapple with continuously as they have
tried to monetise their service; trying
to find the line, which crossed, leads to
users no longer feeling comfortable us-
ing the site.
find their Facebook page. Facebook
pages were internal to those on Face-
book. Three years on and the list of
information from Facebook accessible
to the wider internet is surprising: your
name, photo, picture, gender, network
information (and possibly even your
wall posts) are available by default.
These changes to the service would
be fine if Facebook clearly notified
their users each time a change was
made, or making the changes opt-in.
Problem is time and time again they
haven’t, simply moving all users to
the new, more open privacy settings
by default. It’s a stalker’s paradise but
a job seeker’s nightmare. Even if you
maintain a strict handle on your own
settings, your privacy is also in the
hands of people whom you are in pho-
tos with, and whose walls your write
on. Safely maintaining that extended
presence on the internet is practically
impossible.
I
n a week of privacy being in the
technology press spotlight, we’ve
had several offenders. Facebook
of course has taken centre-stage,
but let’s not forget about Google. Fa-
cebook might own your ‘private infor-
mation’, but Google owns almost all of
that and more. The difference is that
Google owns up when it’s done some-
thing shady, like this week with the
revelation that its StreetView cars have
been collecting terabytes of data from
unsecured wifi routers on their travels.
Apparently due to a programming er-
ror, the data collected has been deleted
and Google said ‘sorry’
. As connected as
we are, it’s easy not to share too much,
but don’t be one of those people to get
caught out. Think before you post it.
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
B
am, another week is
done! Yeah, they’re
flying by now, and the
news is pretty thick
and fast, so here’s a quick run-
down to keep you up-to-date.
In a week filled with Face-
book bashing, the company
re-launched its stripped out
‘lite’ version, Facebook Zero.
This time however it’s aimed at
the ‘emerging markets’, which
apparently will include the
UK, and can be accessed free
of charge due to partnerships
with quite a few network carri-
ers in countries like Indonesia
and Bolivia that are already in
place. The text only site is aim-
ing to be the free sample that
hooks you into the crack that is
the Facebook ecosystem.
Everybody’s favourite (or
loathed) London Mayor, Boris
Johnson, hit the tech news this
week with an announcement
that he wants London to be the
world’s biggest WiFi hotspot.
BoJo plans to use lampposts
and bus stops to blanket the
city in WiFi, all in readiness
for the 2012 Olympics. Many
US cities have tried and failed
to do the same, but fingers
crossed Mayor Blondie can get
it done.
Even if WiFi can’t get the job
done, we might have ubiqui-
tous local networking thanks
to LEDs and some Chinese
boffins. Of course things have
moved on a bit since the days
of IrDA (remember those
days Grandpa?), with 2Mbps
demonstrated using ceiling-
mounted blue LEDs that serve
as lighting at the same time.
We’re not talking Gigabit
speeds here, but it would be
a great way to serve all those
connected appliances we’ve
been promised, Internet fridg-
es, toasters, microwaves and
plant pots, all that ‘future’ tech.
Spotify has been busy this
week too, introducing new
price plans in an attempt to
move its streaming service to
a more viable business model.
By introducing a new free plan
called Spotify Open, new users
can get 20 hours of streaming
music a month supported by
adverts. If that’s not enough,
you now have Spotify Unlim-
ited which is £4.99 a month,
providing unlimited ad-free
streaming to your computer
only. If you want to go mo-
bile, then you’re going to have
to fork over £9.99 a month for
Spotify Premium. Current ad-
supported users won’t be af-
fected by these changes, so fear
not all you stingy-streamers.
Last but not least, DuPont
the company best known for
Lycra among other things,
wants to print up a 50” OLED
display for you in just two min-
utes. Using its latest tech, Du-
Pont reckons it can compete
on cost with LCDs and deliver
15-year lifespans in the near
future. 50” OLED? I’ll take one.

What’s Privacy?

Mark Zuckerberg’s development of
the website. Before Zuckerberg even
coded Facebook, he worked on a small
project called Facemash, which al-
lowed users of the website to rank stu-
dents from Harvard by attractiveness.
The only problem was Zuckerberg
needed users on his website, and to get
those users he hacked into Harvard’s
student database, downloading the re-
quired information to kick the website
off. He then joined a team of students
working on a social networking project
called “ConnectU”, and then bailed to
start Facebook using their ideas. Face-
book paid $65m to the other members
of the team after a lawsuit, an amount
sizeable enough to suggest that there
was some truth in the allegations that
Zuckerberg stole ConnectU’s ideas.
And finally, a chat transcript from early
in Facebook’s days catches Zuckerberg
calling users “dumb f***s” for upload-
ing all their personal information onto
his website. A healthy attitude for a
man now in charge of 400 million user
accounts.
Yet the one thing that has kept people
on Facebook has been inertia. Once
you have built up a friends list contain-
ing a network of hundreds of friends
and family, no one is going to want to
switch networks and rebuild that. Even
more valuable are the pictures, vid-
eos and other content you might have
saved on the website, a fact Zuckerberg
is keenly aware of.
Changes to Facebook have been
ruthlessly bold, with features being
introduced without any beta testing
and seemingly without regard to user
response. The same goes for the pri-
vacy policy; no one really cares until
something bad happens to them, and
by then it’s too late.
Even May 31st being launched as
“Quit Facebook Day” hasn’t raised
anywhere near the amount of attention
required to even make a statement to
Facebook.
If Zuckerberg is banking on apathy, it
looks like a safe bet.
When Facebook was in its infancy, a
social network run only for college stu-
dents at Harvard, the cost of maintain-
ing a largely text and photograph based
service would have been relatively low.
At its current state as the primary so-
cial network for roughly 400 million
people across the globe, serving huge
amounts of video, flash-based games
like Farmville and high resolution im-
ages, the cost of maintaining the site
must be enormous, and that gives rise
to the question of monetisation.
Websites like Google have an easy
and obvious source of revenue with
advertising based on searches. Face-
book also looked to use revenue from
searches, and they had a trump card,
vast amounts of your personal infor-
mation. Yet the problem with sharing
personal data with third parties has
always been, how much is too much.
While I’m fine with Google picking
keywords out of my emails to give me
targeted adverts, would I be fine with
my pictures being used to advertise an
Facebook’s attitude towards finding
this proverbial line has made the prob-
lem many times worse than it should
be. Over half a year ago, Facebook
made a change to its Terms of Service
without making it clear to users. One
of the new paragraphs added stated,
in short, “your stuff is our stuff”. Eve-
rything you published on the service
was owned by Facebook, indefinitely.
After an initial uproar, this was quickly
withdrawn, but it typifies their angle
towards privacy issues: change the
rules first, then wait and see if anyone
notices. A few months back, Face-
book made another new, more subtle
change: allowing an increasing amount
of information to be indexed by search
engines. Three years ago, it wasn’t pos-
sible to Google someone’s name and
The concerns about Facebook’s atti-
tude towards privacy are heightened
