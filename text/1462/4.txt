Alex Karapetian reports on students’ anger at Russell Group proposals
Is the system Down Under a British solution?
Russell Group publish submission
T
he Russell Group’s Browne Review
submission cites the Australian higher
education system as an example the UK
could possibly follow.
STEM (science, technology, engineering and
medicine) subjects are traditionally high-cost de-
grees for universities to run. However, they gen-
erally recognised as degrees of national “strategic
importance.” During the 2010 General Election,
Prime Minister David Cameron deemed science
and engineering “absolutely critical” to underpin-
ning an economic recovery.
The Australian higher education model allows
all home students to be ‘Commonwealth sup-
ported’. These students only pay part of the full
cost of their degree, whilst the rest is publically
funded by the government. The balance between
how much the student is expected to pay and how
much the government will fund is formulated
by two factors: expected earn- ings follow-
ing graduation, and national
priority.
A banding system of de-
gree importance to the coun-
try as a whole is set out, with
the highest band of degree sub-
jects receiving a greater propor-
tion of public-funding. Students
studying Maths, Statistics and Sci-
ence hence have a maximum of
AUS$4,429 or £2,670 per year for their
course. In comparison, Law or Dentistry
undergraduates pay a maximum of
AUS$8,859 or £5,340 a year.

The Russell Group
T
he Russell Group’s sub-
mission to the Browne Re-
view, which was released
after receiving pressure
from the Aldwych Group,
has been met with anger regarding the
proposed increase in tuition fees, fol-
lowing from the felix report last week.
They have labelled the suggestions
“regressive”.
The Aldwych Group represent the
student unions of Russell Group Uni-
versities, currently chaired by Emma-
nuel Akpan-Inwang, from LSE’s Stu-
dents’ Union. The name derives from
the group having been established
at a meeting in LSE, located on the
Aldwych.
Student leaders reacted angrily to
some of the suggestions put forward
by the Russell Group, namely lowering
the threshold after which graduates
begin paying back their debts, current-
ly £15,000, and increasing the rate of
interest in loans in a bid to reduce the
growing deficit in Higher Education.
The Russell Group of twenty research-
based educational institutions includ-
ing Imperial and Oxbridge warned of
debts upwards of £1.1 billion by 2013,
putting the sector ‘’severely at risk’’.
If subsidised student loans were to
be abolished, with interest rates going
up, students will effectively be taking
out loans with rates as high as those
offered by banks today and won’t be
protected from national interest rate
changes, potentially racking up huge
amounts of debt.
The Russell Group, however, advises
that this is a viable solution to encour-
age some up-front payments but to al-
low the government to support loans
to cover significantly higher levels of
tuition fees without increasing costs to
the Treasury.
The Russell Group submission men-
tions that “An increase in graduate
contributions is the fairest and only
viable option for addressing the fund-
ing shortfall’’, setting out how tuition
fees could rise to over £9,000 per
year, a move which students have
described as a ‘’nightmare scenario’’.
Both the Aldwych Group and the
National Union of Students (NUS)
have slammed proposals to lift the
cap on tuition fees, the latter fore-
casting ‘’mortgage-style debts’’ of
more than £40,000 for graduates.
The submission, which is di-
rected to the Browne review
on student finance, led by for-
mer chief executive of BP Lord
Browne, includes the Russell
Group’s recognition that the cap on
fees could not be removed imme-
diately. Its director-general, Wendy
Piatt, said that ‘’fees should increase
incrementally’’ but would not give the
value by which they would increase.
The submission states that ‘’gradu-
ates should be expected to contribute
more in view of the substantial private
benefits they secure through attending
University, particularly from certain
programmes.’’
Science, Technology and Medicine
courses (STEM) are considered ‘’stra-
tegically important’’, and it is proposed
that ‘’the level of public funding for a
student should be a factor of the cost of
providing the course, the private return
and public return, so that no student
is deterred from taking courses like
STEM which are expensive to provide.’’
The proposal to increase the teaching
grant for STEM subjects is considered
by Ashley Brown a ‘’sensible sugges-
tion’’, since Imperial is unable to subsi-
dise lab-based teaching with the profits
from cheaper classroom based sub-
jects. He mentions this is a suggestion
‘’which we have called for in the past’’.
The Russell Group proposed a means
of differentiating costs similar to the
Australian higher education system.
They advised that high cost
subjects considered of stra-
tegic importance to the coun-
try should receive more in
state funds and cost students
less, but did not specify an
amount. The Group justified
the increases by explaining that
‘’if graduates were asked to pay
steeper fees, they would value
their degrees more highly and
be careful about and committed
to the choices they made.’’ The
group denied that the move would
deter students from poor and un-
privileged backgrounds from ap-
plying to University.
The Group provided research figures
to show that graduates earn the equiva-
lent of about £160,000 more than non-
graduates over their lifetimes, £3,000
more per year with greater job satisfac-
tion if they were from a Russell Group
A collaboration between the UK’s
20 leading universities, including
Imperial. It is essentially the UK’s
answer to the USA’s Ivy League
system. The 20 member universities
generally receive about two-thirds of
total government funding each
year. Together, the universities
have a strong influence on
the state of the UK’s higher
education; it is well-reported
that they support lifting the
current £3,255 cap on fees.
T
here is change in the air. As the
talk of coalitions and minority
governments are whisked away
with a passing breeze, students
are starting to take a stand. Stu-
dent activism has slowly faded since the noisy
days of the 1960s, but the imminent changes
in higher education may rekindle the long-
gone traditions.
Last week saw students entering the Russell
Group’s offices on Northumberland Avenue
demanding to see what changes to student fi-
nances their universities had proposed. This
came as The Russell Group were the last to
submit their suggestions and perspectives on
the current and future state of British higher
education to a cross-party review set up by
the Government.
The first port of call was to allow all rel-
evant parties, from higher education think-
tanks to student unions, to lay down their
own arguments for how the Government
should proceed.
The Russell Group will inevitably hold a
massive weighting in which way the Review
swings. Early reports about their suggestions
to increase tuition fees have been proven cor-
rect with the full publication of the Russell
Group’s submission this past Friday.

Funding review protest
I
mperial College Union took part
in a protest that saw students
from the 20 leading English uni-
versities demand that “disingen-
uous” tactics by their institutions
stop.
Ashley
Brown, Imperial College
Union President, entered the Russell
Group offices alongside other student
representatives from across the coun-
try this past Monday. They handed
over a strong letter of protest insisting
that the Russell Group publish
their
reports submitted to Lord Browne’s
review on higher education fees.
The Russell Group is a collective of
20 leading
universities, including Im-
perial College. The Aldwych Group
is a the student union counterpart,
describing themselves as the Russell
Group’s “watchdog”.
The Russell Group had reportedly
refused to publicly divulge the content
of reports that were to be submitted
to the Indepedent Review
of Higher
Education Funding and Student Fi-
nance. The review is led by ex-BP
Chief Executive, Lord Browne. How-
ever, a spokesperson for the Russell
Group told felix that they had “always
intended to make the reports publicly
available.”
Lord Browne had asked all relevant
parties from across the country to sub-
mit a first round of written arguments
and viewpoints for a review that on
completion, will influence the Govern-
ment’s decision on increasing univer-
sity tuition fees. The 1994 Group, who
represent a lower tier of British uni-
versities, have already submitted their
reports alongside around 90 other in-
stitutions. They are all publically avail-
able on the Review’s official website,
but one report’s admission has been
noted: The Russell Group’s.
Oxford
University Student Union
had requests for freedom of informa-
tion on this report previously rejected;
The Russell Group had asked their re-
ports to be kept confidential until pub-
lication.
