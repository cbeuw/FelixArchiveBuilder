Nick Clegg firmly took the Conservatives by the balls after they failed to gain an overall majority in the general election
Do Brits really want electoral reform?
O
nly in Britain would it
be possible to stage a
general election where
everyone lost. But alas
this is the strange forti-
tude that now de-masks itself in front
of the world; Britain’s first coalition
government since the Second World
War, and boy are we in for a ride.
Labour introduced 111 tax rises
since 1997, took a trillion pounds in
additional taxation, and still left us
with a Greek-level deficit: 12.6 per
cent of GDP and rising. Of every four
pounds Gordon Brown spent, one was
borrowed. The national debt is rising
by nearly £6,000 a second.
Clearly this is the time to be talking
about electoral reform then.
Most of you will already be famil-
iar with the strange constitutional
spectacle that took place on Wednes-
day the 12th of May 2010. Mr. Brown
resigned as PM, Mr. David Cameron
became the new PM and Nick Clegg,
the leader of the Liberal Democrats,
was running around like a headless
chicken trying to figure from which
main party he could get the best
electoral reform deal. Never mind
the economic crisis facing the coun-
try, electoral reform must come first
if you are a Liberal Democrat. In the
Dutch Auctions of the past a few days,
change in the voting system has been
caricatured as a deal breaker.
By muddling the genuine argu-
ments that can be made for reform,
with cynical attempts to cobble to-
gether the self-serving electoral ar-
rangements necessary to sustain the
hegemony of particular politicians,
there is a grave danger that the case
for reform will be lost. A coalition
was formed with no mandate what-
soever for far-ranging constitutional
reform. But as events transpired: Mr.
Clegg wanted PR but was given AV
but under the FPTP system he got
royally buggered. What on earth does
that latter sentence mean you are
probably thinking? Good thing you

picked up felix, for you are about to
find out.
Whenever there is an election and
a political party loses they blame the
system. You will be familiar with this
procedure as it is a juxtaposition of
when your exam results arrive. This
time the Liberal Democrats were
border-lining on obsession when it
came to the electoral system. With
hindsight, one does understand Mr.
Clegg’s grievances. Not only did he
get nearly every single student vote
in the country he was also at the cen-
tre of “Cleggmania”. What happened?
Well, he actually lost seats compared
to the last general election in 2005.
Mr. Clegg’s solution to this little hic-
cup is to change the voting system to
something known as ‘PR’ or Propor-
tional Representation.
No electoral system is perfect.
Some, however, are more perfect
than others, and some are utter shite.
Under the Proportional Representa-
tion system or ‘PR’, several members
of parliament would be elected per
constituency. Every political party
presents a list of candidates and vot-
ers can select a list, that is they vote
for a political party. Parties are as-
signed parliamentary seats propor-
tionally to the number of votes they
get. There are several pros and cons of
this system and at first sight it would
seem that it is the most democratic.
Every interest group would be repre-
sented in parliament, if that system
had been used on Friday, the BNP
would have 12 MPs today. There is
also more choice for voters since, as
said; every interest can be represent-
ed if enough people vote for it.
The current system is unrepre-
sentative – it gives all the power to
one party, however small its majority
might be. For instance, only a quarter
of those eligible voted for Labour at
the last general election.
As it is, many MPs are elected to
Parliament despite 75 per cent of
their constituency voting against
them. Often solid, centrist policies
will result and that is fine if you be-
long to continental Europe which
has such traditions, as PR seldom re-
sults in one party holding an absolute
majority, it requires governments to
compromise and build consensus ac-
cording to FairVote.org. PR can cre-
ate stable government, but not nec-
essarily strong government. Of grave
importance is that any significant
change to the electoral procedure
would require a national referendum,
particularly since the constitution of
the United Kingdom is uncodified.
The coalition governments that PR
tends to produce are often weak and
indecisive. Italy, which has such a
system, has had to dissolve its parlia-
ment seven times in the last 40 years
and has had 60 different governments
in the same time (and counting).
When List PR is used, and particu-
larly when seats are allocated in one
single national district, as in Namibia
or Israel, the system is criticized for
destroying the link between voters
and their representatives.
Where lists are closed, voters have
no opportunity to determine the
identity of the persons who will rep-
resent them and no identifiable rep-
resentative for their town, district or
village, nor can they easily reject an
individual representative if they feel
that he or she has performed poorly
in office, or is not the kind of person
they would want representing them.
The system also encourages exces-
sive entrenchment of power within
party headquarters and in the hands
of senior party leaderships. A can-
didate’s position on the party list,
and therefore his or her likelihood
of success, is dependent on currying
favour with party bosses, while their
relationship with the electorate is
of secondary importance. Only one
in five people who went to the polls
voted for the Liberal Democrats, yet
the Liberal Democrats are now call-
