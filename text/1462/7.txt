Imperial’s arts magazine is
rising from the ashes...
Phoenix, Imperial’s historic arts
magazine, returns in its original
form as an annual this year. It was
created in 1904 by Imperial alumnus
and famous author, H.G. Wells .
Phoenix needs student contributions. If you’re feeling
the strains of science or just enjoy being creative, send
in your poetry, fiction, photography and artwork to
phoenix@imperial.ac.uk.
