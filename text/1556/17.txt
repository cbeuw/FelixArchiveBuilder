FRIDAY 18 OCT
BOOKS
Calum Grant: Having written about
the history of mathematics, code
breaking, the Big Bang and Alter-
native medicine, was this book on
maths Easter eggs in the Simpsons
the easiest book you’ve written?
Simon Singh: I think so. You see there’s
no real theme, no rhyme or reason to
what I do. Both of the maths books I’ve
written I would like to revisit and have
another run at some of the chapters.
For students at Imperial they may be
ﬁne, but my audience is the general
reader. This book was pretty easy, but
the big challenge was working out the
make-up of this one. The ﬁrst draft had
six big chapters covering topics like
Lisa and her more rational approach
in the show, and another chapter on
the role of pi – which turns up now
and then in various episodes. However,
when I was on the plane to the USA to
meet the writing staﬀ of the show I de-
cided to reconstruct the entire book it
into eighteen shorter chapters to make
it more pacey and digestible. I had to
make sure it had the write balance of
the writers stories, the history of the
maths involved and why maths minded
writers may be funny.
CG: As someone with a PhD in par-
ticle physics, and having written sev-
eral popular science and maths best-
sellers how much did you yourself
learn about maths purely through
researching all the Simpsons Maths
Easter eggs?
SS: I had never really thought deeply
about what fractals were before. When
explaining how, in an episode of Fu-
turama, Leela and Prof. Farnsworth go
from being in three dimensions to two
dimensions after a scientiﬁc mishap.
This meant they went through a fractal
landscape on the way, and so it took me
some time to fully understand it so I
could explain it in the book.
CG: Were there any maths references
you were taken back by, at the sheer
incredibility of them being smuggled
in?
SS: I just ﬁnd all of them astonishing -
because there’s no reason any of them
should be there!
CG: Did you make any suggestions
for Maths jokes or ideas they could
explore in any future episodes?
SS: No. I did ask if they have a moun-
tain of ideas they are trying to get in,
but most of these ideas just come from
nowhere during the writing process.
Jeﬀ Westbrook said he had wanted to
get undecidability into an episode of
The Simpsons, but hadn’t worked out
how to.
CG: You talk in the book about the
writers and producers having regrets
about walking away from a life in
academia and research, and most
people would be flabbergasted that
given the careers they would feel this
was about not following up on sci-
ence. Did you find that surprising?
SS: No, I didn’t actually. I left Physics
and went to join the BBC where I’d be
visiting great laboratories, meeting Ste-
phen Hawking, going to volcanoes with
geologists and just seeing so many sci-
entists doing real science, something I’d
always wanted to do. And I still think
there can’t be anything more wonderful
than making a new discovery, of com-
ing up with a breakthrough of making a
new invention. But for me I clearly did
the right thing; if I had stayed in sci-
ence I wouldn’t have been a very good
scientist. My skill set is pretty perfectly
matched for what I’ve ended up doing,
and I think it’s the same for them. What
else could they have done but be the
greatest comedy writing team in the
world? But I can see why there is a little
bit of them that is sad they that never
got to solve any great theorems.
CG: Did you ever set out to become a
science writer?
SS: No. I took a gap year before my
undergraduate degree and went and
worked in industry. That year at the
research centre I worked on semi-con-
ductors and integrated circuits. Then
when I was at Imperial I did a summer
placement in Delaware at an electri-
cal engineering lab, a position I got
mostly due to my gap year job. Then I
got a PhD working on semi-conductor
detectors at Cern, helped enormously
by my previous placements. I got the
job at the BBC because I had the PhD,
and I wouldn’t have got into writing if I
hadn’t been at the BBC. Looking back
you can see a path, but there was no
grand plan.
CG: Do you have any rules or your
own approach to conveying some-
times heavy-going scientific ideas to
the greater public?
SS: I write the books that I would
want to read. I’m interested in history,
stories, people and heroes; things that
make me smile and laugh. I only write
about things I ﬁnd interesting, and I
really maintain my sense of interest
and wonder of things long after their
novelty has passed. I assume my read-
ers are bright and curious, but don’t
assume they are in any way experts.
CG: Are there any writers who you
grew up with, who got you into sci-
ence and who you aspire to be?
SS: I think Richard Dawkins is the most
beautiful writer, and I really admire
that. If anyone asks me to read I always
refuse because ﬁrstly I’m not good at
reading, but mostly my prose...its just
doesn’t sound very good. I admire that,
but I don’t aspire to it. Reviews of my
work often say ‘clearly written’
, they
never say ‘beautifully written’
.
CG: You courted a lot of controversy
going after alternative medicine.
Were you intimidated or nervous to
be writing and releasing that book?
SS: No. My co-writer Edzard Ernst
did warn me, as he’d been a profes-
sor in that ﬁeld for ten years. He got
hate mail, people called him very
nasty things. He wouldn’t get invited to
conferences, or get his work accepted
at them. It never really bothered me
though because I don’t have a job. I
really appreciate the fact that I can say
and do what I want; I can stand up at a
science communication conference and
say ‘that was an appalling example of
science communication, it was waste-
ful, pointless and society X should be
ashamed of itself ‘ because I’m not
someone who has to work with such
a society or apply to them for grant
money in the future.
CG: Did you consider writing a book
about your libel case and subsequent
legal reform?
SS: Yes, I thought about it. It’s a great
story of grass roots activism, and a
great story of how you can change the
laws within a political system. In a way
I wish somebody had written it, but I
don’t think it’s the right book for me.
For this kind of adventurous story you’d
need someone who could bring out
the emotion, and the personal angels
involved.
CG: Why don’t Maths jokes work in
base 8? Because 7 10 11.
SS: Very good.
An interview with Simon Singh
Calum Grant
Writer
Demetri Martin’s first book of draw-
ings is an utterly beguiling read from
start to finish. Perhaps it isn’t ac-
curate to say ‘read’ as there are few
words in it- each page is taken up by
a new simple black-and-white line
drawing of charming hilarity, rang-
ing from a graph of melted cheese
temperature against time (with a
discontinuity at perfect tempera-
ture) to a man walking a fish.
It is a book that is easily dipped
into and out of, with the sheer num-
ber and diversity of the sketches
meaning that it can be read from
cover to cover over and over again,
each time finding something new.
Most of its comedy is light-hearted
and observational, so appeals to a
wide audience, though some of it
leans towards the slightly more ma-
cabre, like the double page spread of
skulls ending in your own.
Anyone who is familiar with Dem-
etri Martin as a comedian from his
many television broadcasts and
stand-up shows, will recognise his
charming trademark mix of cheer-
ful, somewhat silly one liners and
slightly more satirical and thought-
ful sketches. For anyone who isn’t,
he can be described succinctly by
his list on influences on Wikipedia,
which includes Eddie Izzard and So-
crates.
With its Venn Diagrams, enter-
taining questions such as: ‘why do
the lions have to be tamed?’ and off-
the-wall equations like ‘spray tan=
(vanity + stupidity)aerosol’, this
book comes across as the doodles
of someone trying to make sense of
life, albeit someone who doesn’t take
it too seriously.
I found myself laughing aloud
many times at this book and insist-
ently passing it around to share my
favourites. Point Your Face At This is
sure to make you smile, laugh, and
think a little, and would make a per-
fect gift for almost anyone, especial-
ly for yourself!
