F
irst, a disclaimer: for those with
a strong aversion to musicals
avoid this play at all costs.
Liolà opens with a group
of gypsy musicians providing
music to what looks like a strange
village sacriﬁce. One point to director
Richard Eyre for immediate audience
captivation.
It turns out that this is early 20th
century Sicily, and the assumed-
sacriﬁce, Mita, is in fact the young
wife of rich ‘Uncle Simone’, forced to
dance because she is blamed for his
lack of children.
In a nutshell, without giving away
too much of the very little story that
there is, Uncle Simone’s niece, Tuzza,
is jealous that she was not chosen as his
wife and mother of his children. After
getting pregnant by the charming but
slimey Liolà, who already has three
sons by three diﬀerent women, Tuzza
persuades Uncle Simone to declare
the child as his own in order to stake a
claim in the inheritance that the child
would one day gain. Liolà, being Mita’s
childhood friend and star-crossed
lover, helps her to prevent Tuzza
getting away with the devilish plan.
As demonstrated by the plot, this
is not a very profound piece of work.
Although I am unfamiliar with the
original by Luigi Pirandelli, who an
Italian source informs me was a classic
author that many studied at school,
there is not really any need to be
able to compare it to Tanya Ronder’s
adaptation for the National. The play
really is what it is.
Which is, a bunch of Irish actors
running on and oﬀ the stage in song,
laughter, tears – but mostly song
– with Sicilian hair (mainly dark
curls), old-style Italian dress, and a
Mediterranean backdrop. The fact
that it obviously was not an Irish
production that was so well-acclaimed
that it had to be shipped over to us
Londoners, but actually Irish culture
as a centre-point to the adaptation,
makes it slightly bizarre.
I have tried to work this one out.
Obviously, British actors squabbling
in thick Italian accents and cries of
“Mamma Mia!” or whatever we expect
Italians to do based on our viewing of
Dolmio adverts probably would not
have been very PC.
Is the Irish element supposed to
allow us to relate to the social values
considered by the piece yet emphasise
the foreign and anachronistic context
What: Die Fledermaus with the
English National Opera
Where: London Coliseum
When: Until 6th Nov 2013
Price: Various
D
ie Fledermaus, the Bat, is
an operetta by the king of
the Viennese waltz, Johann
Strauss Jr. Operetta, the
ancestor of today’s musicals,
is an entirely diﬀerent aﬀair from
opera. The plots are frivolous and
funny and mostly carried through
dialogue with punctuating musical
numbers. Through its development in
the 19th century it became extremely
popular for its crude humour, which
bordered on the pornographic.
Eventually even professional and
‘serious’ opera houses began to stage
operetta, albeit in a toned-down style.
When Strauss entered the scene and
made the operetta famous in Vienna,
the plots were less crude; they were
funny for their parodying of social
values. The music he wrote was more
reﬁned and typically Viennese with
waltzes, polkas and other dances in
the style that brought him fame in the
casinos and ballrooms.
Die Fledermaus is his masterpiece
of operetta and the plot is suitably
absurd; in revenge for a past practical
joke, Dr Falke invites Eisenstein, who
is wanted by the police, to a ball where
he must be disguised. Dr Falke also
invites Eisenstein’s wife, his maid and
the prison governor, all in disguise.
At the ball there are some awkwardly
funny encounters, but overall the
mood is celebratory and the company
sings a tribute to the “king of wines”,
champagne. By the ﬁnal act, everyone
ﬁnds themselves in prison where the
jailor too is drunk, but the prank is
revealed and everyone lives happily
ever after.
Usually this is a hugely funny and
cheerful event, but not so at the
English National Opera. Director
Christopher Alden has tried to elevate
this operetta into the ranks of the
most profound of German opera, with
disastrous results. This is a production
in complete conﬂict with itself; the
tension between the light-hearted
plot with its sparkling waltzes and
the dark and serious aesthetic of the
production are stark and irresolvable.
The ever-present bed and the
immobile hands of the clock suggest
that the action is taking place in
someone’s dream. From this pours
forth a series of bizarre sequences,
always surreal, occasionally funny, but
sometimes actually horrifying. Large
sections are confusing, the dialogue
barely making sense given the on-
stage action. Larger stretches still are
bleak and depressing. The entire ﬁnal
act is a black abyss through which
any trace of humour is sucked as we
watch police oﬃcers (suspiciously
resembling the Gestapo) beat people
and point guns threateningly.
Given the staging, the music hardly
seems worth mentioning; though
played well enough it could hardly
be called a waltz at such fast speeds.
The cast performed admirably, and I
am sure the fault for the rather cold
interpretations lies with the director.
Alden has tried to ﬁnd and present a
psychological subtext where perhaps
there isn’t one, and in the process has
assassinated operetta. It may have
been possible to ﬁnd interesting truths
here if I’d taken my psychoanalysis
textbook and a pen, but the ENO has
published the greatest possible of
untruths in their own description of
the production: “Light-hearted and
colourful”. That is everything it was
supposed to be, but also everything it
wasn’t. My advice would be to avoid
this.
they occur in?
It is probably best not to think about
it too much. In fact, there is little need
to think about much at all during the
play – but this is no bad thing.
Although it is easy to imagine it
could have been controversial in its
day, there is little else that invokes
much pondering. There seem to be
no hidden meanings or metaphors,
and even the songs are so literal
that I was slightly taken aback when
one character started singing about
peeling potatoes for her dinner
Aside from the very few and very
slight GCSE Drama cringe moments,
it is a very well directed play. Its
light-heartedness is humourous and
charming, and although it borders on
the cheesiness of what many musicals
are known for it never falls directly in,
and even I with an aversion to them
managed enjoyed it.

Song, dance, laughter, tears...
and Sicilian facial hair. A recipe
for musical success!
