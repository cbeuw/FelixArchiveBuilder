Playing for the ﬁrst time as the newly
branded Imperial 6th XV, ICURFC’s
3rd team made a slow start to the
season, suﬀering defeat at the hands
of an organised UCL outﬁt.
Scoring from their ﬁrst attack of the
game, UCL immediately put Imperial
on the back foot with strong running
and good link-up play. Despite brave
defensive work the pressure did not
let up and Imperial went into half time
four tries down.
Putting the result out of their minds,
Imperial’s players refocused in
the second half and, with the help
of senior players coming oﬀ the
bench, produced a much-improved
performance. Organisation and
discipline paid oﬀ as Imperial scored
twice late in the game and at the ﬁnal
whistle left the ﬁeld in positive spirits.
Following this summer’s BUCS ruling
that forced the merger in name of
Imperial and the Medics, Imperial
College 3rd XV arrived at Shenley
Sports ground in their new guise as
Imperial 6th XV shortly before the
monstrous convoy of UCL coaches.
The Imperial line-up featured many
fresh faces, all of whom were keen
to prove their credentials. After a
warm up led by new captain Luke
‘The Angel of the North’ Armitage
and part time rugby coach/full time
Techtonic crooner James Hayward,
the game started. Imperial kicked oﬀ

but were pegged back by their main
rivals almost instantly. UCL made
around 40 yards and, after some savvy
oﬄoads, scored their ﬁrst try. The
Imperial back line was overwhelmed
by the strong running of the huge
centres who looked as though they
were capable of playing higher level
rugby. The ﬁrst half was a generally
disheartening encounter for Imperial,
with UCL running in 3 more tries to
leave the score 26-0.
At half time some impact substitutions
were made, with the chemical
(engineering) brothers themselves
- ‘ﬂair pair’ Colin Matthews and
Alex Ruﬀman - coming on as the
two centres to give some much-
needed experience and attacking
prowess. Imperial showed signs of
improvement, but despite this UCL
managed to score again.
With heads going down, singer/
songwriter Hayward stepped in with
some rousing words and stirred the
boys up for a ﬁnal push. Prop Hugh
MacKinnon had to come oﬀ injured,
forcing disgruntled Italian bus driver
Edoardo ‘Bunga Bunga’ Cavallazzi to
come on as a replacement Loosehead
Prop. This was despite his pre-game
declaration to his captain that if he
were forced to play in the front row he
would resign.
The forwards pulled together and
started to play the famous ‘Imperial
Pattern’ making full use of the pitch.
After some clever kicks from Fly-
half Alex Leonard, Imperial found
themselves inside the UCL 22m
line. After many strong phases of
traditional attacking rugby later, a
ruck formed close to the UCL try
line. A crash ball from Jasper popped
by the ‘short controller’ Armitage
was enough to send UCL defenders
ﬂying and Jasper touched down to
give Imperial a consolation try. With
spirits visibly lifted Imperial gave
everything in their power to not
concede any more points and pushed
hard again. Some minutes later IC
constructed a rolling maul very near
to the UCL try line, with Jonno ‘top
scorer’ Stancombe holding onto the
ball like a bear to honey at the back.
As he has done so often for Imperial,
Stancombe spotted the big white line,
and made a dive for it, putting the ball
safely on the ﬂoor. Leonard slotted the
conversion, leaving the ﬁnal score 42-
12, a better-looking score than what
looked likely at half time.
An unfortunate result to open the
season but with plenty to build
on, Geordie Captain Armitage
congratulated the team on a ‘canny
decent’ performance.
Congratulations on an encouraging
performance to all the freshers,
including debut ﬂanker and man of
the match Yix Lin.
