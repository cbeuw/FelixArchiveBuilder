This week, some drunk idiot
breaks into your flat. You try
to fend him off with your penis
statue,andkillhimintheprocess.
Next thing you know you have to
pick up the soap in a women’s
prison. Pint?
This week, you have to decide
on having Uggs as ears
or having Crocs as hands.
While the Uggs are certainly
comfortable, they would make
finding a potential make out
partner nigh impossible. On
the other Croc, self-pleasure
would surely be painful with
plastic appendages.
This week, you decide that
you’ve had enough of imperial,
and try your hand at being a
beach bum. After hitchhiking
to Spain, you lay down in the
warm sand, just to be decapi-
tated by a horde of sea gulls.
Maybe your coursework wasn’t
that bad after all…
This weeks, you forgot your abili-
ties using good grammar. How-
ever as no one saying anything
to you ever, you not notice and
end up writes a autobiography
no ones could ever understand-
ing. Well, at least you does not
have croc’s for hand.
This week, still suffering from
fresher’s week hangover, and
tired of the horrible headaches
you decide to check out a
“cure” you found on the internet.
It consists of chewing on the
ears of every fresher. After going
through the gruesome task you
find that it hasn’t helped at all,
and instead just down a galleon
of milk. (Responsible drinking!)
This week, you cannot seem to
stop talking in rhyme. I mean it
happens all the time.
After you’ve lost all your friends
and your sexless spell extends,
you decide that you have had
enough, I mean Imperial is just
too tough. The only option is
hermit life, ending your rhyming
strife.
This week, after splashing in
the Ethos pool, you decide to
join your scaly brethren. As a
medicine student, you know
exactly how to surgically add
gills to yourselves. You jump into
the Atlantic, marry a wonderful
Blue Tang called Dory and live
happily ever after.
This week, after a particularly long
dry spell and reading 50 Shades
of Grey, you decide to accept the
male strip club voucher the Felix
Editor offers you. You go there half
naked, ready to be pleasured, and
find out that the address is actually
an old persons’ home. Well you
think, while you’re at it…

This week, a demon granny
stabs you to death with her
knitting needles because you
didn’t give her your seat on the
bus. GET THE FUCK UP, MAN.
You also have no money on your
oyster card. Ever. Because you
are shit at life.
This week you come back from the
Gloucester Arms mildly tipsy and
armed with a fantastic array of Fluid
Mechanics puns. You laugh to
yourself merrily as you unlock your
room door. Unfortunately you trip as
you go inside, fall on your viscosity
constant and end up phoning an
ambulance with a pitot tube in an
uncomfortable area. Your injury is
classified as sub-critical.
This week you try to get in to
see Prince Harry’s speech on
campus. As you try to sneak in
you are greated by HRH himself
who promptly stares at you with
hearts shining in his eyes. As
you jump into his arms you slip
but he catches you anyway. You
both smile as you ride of into the
sunset,

IC UNION MEDIA GROUP PLOTS
WORLD TAKEOVER
After the success of the SubStream event
the IC Radio and STOIC societies take on
Hollywood
After this week’s SubStream event
(October 18), IC Radio and STOIC
managers began a plot to take over
the world. Our reporter overheard the
following conversation between the
managers of the media outlets:
“ICR: Now people have seen how
successful our events we can be,
hopefully we’ll break the 100 listener
barrier and move onto bigger and
brighter things.
ST:True,butwemusttreadcarefully,
our step should be to neutralise our
closest opponents which means that
we need to take over the TV signal
that broadcasts to the televisions in
the Student Hub as well as changing
the speakers in all public areas on
campus so they only play the IC Radio
audio.
ICR: But what next? We have to have
a grander plan, after taking over the
Imperial campus next week we’ll need
something to keep us busy between
lectures....”
Meanwhile in the West Basement,
the Felix team carefully planned the
next steps of it’s goal to become “the
Voice of the Students” by subverting
the Union Council to their will.
To highlight his dislike of magenta
and cyan the Editor decided to run
for every possible position in the
Elections, writing manifestos for each
role including a unique headshot for
each role and an amusing anecdote
involving a cabbage, a shoe and a copy
of the movie Helvetica. Meanwhile
PhotoSoc and A Global Village
preferred subliminal messaging.

UNION SOC OFF EVENT
GENERATES NUISANCE
COMPLAINTS
After a mix-up in communications,
Thursday’s “Great Soc Oﬀ” event at
the Union deviated from it’s usual
programme as several confused
engineers and mathematicians used
a more liberal interpretation of the
event.
200 undergraduates from the
department of Civil Engineering
arrived wearing their Personal
Protective Equipment, including their
steel reinforced boots. After an hour
of mild dancing in Metric the students
decided to take of their shoes and
socks, waving their socks in the air
with wild abandon.
The poor mathematicians,
bewildered by the crowd and lack
of decent wine, followed suit, also
removing their socks to take part in
the Civils rave dance.
As more students participated in
this new dance, an opportunistic
member of the bar recorded the video
while a less than impressed Deputy
President of Education hurried to the
exits to open the windows.
Despite the DPE’s swift response
Metric proceeded to smell worse until
eventuallytheEmbassyofRichCountry
made an oﬃcial nuisance complaint.
The police, unable to stand the smell
referred the case to the RSPCA.
