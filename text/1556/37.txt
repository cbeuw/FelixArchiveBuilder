FRIDAY 18 OCT
GAMES

P
artying. Hostages. Drinks.
Machetes. Skydiving.
Friends. Pirates. The
game starts oﬀ with a
montage of you (as Jason
Brody), your brothers and your
friends having the time of their
life on a large island in the south
paciﬁc. The nightmare quickly
begins when Jason wakes up to ﬁnd
himself imprisoned in a bamboo
cage by indigenous pirates, and it’s
not long before you meet the ﬁend
himself, the psycho pirate lord Vaas.
You are now tasked with missions
in service of the Rakyat leading to
rescuing your friends, taking over
the Island, and assassinating Vaas.
There is a lot of fun in watching
Jason progress through the game
as he self-teaches himself ways to
survive through the jungle including
his extraordinary methods of healing
himself! A shot to the arm while
driving will prompt Brody to ‘bite
the bullet’ as he clenches the bullet
out of his ﬂesh with his teeth and
spit it out all with one hand on the
wheel. There are plenty of other
reﬂexes and scenes spread through
the game that give the player a
feeling that they are adapting better
into the environment with Brody.
The overall plot of Far Cry 3 is
engaging and the characterisation
and development of the cast are
impressive. Vaas’ famous question
on insanity rings in the players ears
when we start to see suspicious
and creepy stuﬀ around the Island.
Insanity permeates through this
Island. Those who learn to embrace
and adapt to the Island turn more
vicious, tribal, angry, dehumanised
and animalistic. We follow the once
scared twenty-something frightened,
Jason Brody turn into a ruthless
skilled killer. It is a theme that
culminates to an epic conclusion
where the player is granted a choice
that decides the ending of the game.
Far Cry 3 really beautifully couples
the story parts of the game with the
non-story parts. Here’s why: When
you are roaming the Island, you can
hunt diﬀerent animals, forage rare
plants that you can use to upgrade
yourpouchesandweaponsrucksacks,
health potions and other recipes.
You can also hijack radio towers to
uncover more places in the map,
take control of pirate coves, trials
of the Rakyat. The skills, equipment
and knowledge of the island you
gain from these extra missions
undergird the story line missions
which become increasingly diﬃcult.
Unfortunately, the weapons and
collectibles inventory was diﬃcult
to use and this did take a toll on the
gameplay as the game progressed
into more challenging zones -
perhaps most annoying was my
mini-expedition to hunt dangerous
and rare animals for special leather
for a promised upgraded pouch
to store four weapons but I could
still only hold a maximum of two.
The accessibility and simplicity
of the rucksack inventory is
deﬁnitely a room for improvement
for the rumoured sequel to this
game set to come out in 2014.
Jason has a good range of weapons
at his disposal that he can purchase
at a Rakyat shop or he can unlock
for free by claiming radio towers.
There is a huge scope to be clever
and creative with how you use
weapons to conquer pirate coves
or complete missions in general.
Take your short-range ﬂamethrower
to set nearby enemies on ﬁre or be
more strategic and beset pirates
by setting a whole cove on ﬁre. The
sniper riﬂe is man’s best friend in
this game; it really makes me feel
in control when Jason can take out
pirates one by one at a distance.
There are plenty of other good
weapons to purchase and unlock too.
Vehicles can be used in and outside
of missions from buggies to cargo
trucks to jet skis to handgliders
(pretty fun). Your vehicles can take
damage from enemy attacks and
bashing into trees and falling of
mountain sides - a fun experience.
Vehicle control is not too demanding
to frustrate the game play and not
too simple to use to break away
from the realism of the game.
The music and sound eﬀects
deserve merit too. The realistic
and frightening sound tracks truly
capture the suspense of the moment
and I still ﬁnd myself listening to
some of the legendary soundtracks
oﬀ YouTube. All this combined
with stunning graphics will
captivate you for hours of pure joy.
Far Cry 3 was released in November
2012. It can currently be bought
for around £16.99 on PS3, £17.99
on XBOX 360, and £12.99 on PC.
T
here are few new games that
hold my attention for very
long anymore. I’m bored of
games like Assassins Creed
and Halo with their endless
sequels that seem to oﬀer nothing
new except better graphics (even
though I still buy them). However
there is something about Nintendo
that makes me forgive them for
doing just that. Every new Mario,
Zelda and Donkey Kong game that
comes out always get me excited,
and Windwaker HD is no exception.
As a massive fan of the original
Gamecube version I was pretty sure
I would like this one too, but I didn’t
expect to like it as much as I do.
Windwaker, for those who didn’t
play the original, is a game in the
Legend of Zelda series. You play
as Link, the hero of time, and must
complete dungeons and solve
problems in order to rescue princess
Zelda. Windwaker is the only game
(discounting the DS ones) that uses
a cartoon art style, which looks
beautiful remastered in HD. Although
the game looks diﬀerent it is still the
game many of you will remember
and will provide many moments of
nostalgia. Everything that originally
made this game mothertrucking
amazing is still here. There is so much
that this game does well; the plot is
engaging and often full of humour, the
world is open and big and apart from
a short “tutorial” at the beginning is
open for you to explore right from
the start. All the items you get in this
game are used again and again and
don’t feel like gimmicks, with the best
obviously being the Deku Leaf! The
combat system is arguably the best of
any Zelda game and your character
always responds how you would like.
The Wii U version does add more
than HD graphics. Link controls
even better than before on the
gamepad or pro controller. Pausing
the game to look at maps or switch
items has been made unnecessary
as you can do all that seamlessly on
the gamepad screen in the middle
of a ﬁght, or sailing on your boat.
Sailing around is even more of a joy
with the addition of a fast sail that
enables you to sail faster, and always
have the wind behind you. Fans of
the original may be glad to hear that
the Triforce collecting at the end
has been shortened, causing less
frustrating encounters with Tingle
(the Jar Jar Binks of Zelda). For the
completionests out there, the game
oﬀers a gallery where you can turn
photos into ﬁgurines. When I was
young, playing the original, my goal
in life was the complete this gallery,
but it was frustrating as many of
the pictures are missable causing
a complete gallery to take many
playthroughs (there is a second quest
after you ﬁnish the game). However,
the remake, as well as oﬀering an
expanded memory to your camera
(12 pictures), has Tingle Bottles:
bottles you can throw in the sea with
messages and pictures. As well as
being a nice and often funny addition
to the game, it now means you can
get the pictures from other people
making the Nintendo Gallery a more
achievable and enjoyable experience.
I may achieve my lifelong goals at last!
Despite being amazing in nearly
every way I do have some very minor
complaints. You can now move while
aiming items, which can be great in
certain situations but often it can be
awkward. Try aiming and shooting an
item while moving and the item is not
bound to a trigger for example. Also
the game is too easy. I completed my
ﬁrst playthough (around 18 hours)
without dying a single time, and I even
had my fairy I collected just before
the ﬁrst boss still in its bottle. These
problems however are so minor and
you could argue aren’t problems. The
aiming can be made good by binding
aimable items to a trigger, and I
actually found it extremely useful to
move and aim at times. There is also
a Hero Mode which makes the game
harder and I will deﬁnitely be using
this during my second playthough.
Overall I believe Windwaker HD
is still the amazing game it was and
this version just improves it to near
perfection. It is deﬁnitely my most
played Wii U game already in just
a week, and I see myself putting
many more hours into it before I
get tired. There’s just so much to do.
