FRIDAY 18 OCT
FOOD
Michael Chung made a classic with organic vegetables from London
A few weeks back we mentioned the
Farmers’ Market, but that is not the
only place to get fresh vegetables on
campus! The ICU Co-op has a new
partnership with Sutton Community
Farm, which is about 13 miles from
South Kensington. Fresh, seasonal
vegetables are harvested every week
and distributed around London via its
VegBag scheme. All the vegetables are
farmed organically and it is quite en-
vironmentally friendly because of the
low carbon footprint. The content of
the bag is also kind of a mystery - since
all the goods is seasonal, but typically
it will contain potatoes, onions and
carrots at the very least!
Here at Felix Food, we ordered a
medium VegBag to try. For £11.50, we
also got some kale, half a pumpkin,
some pea pods, courgettes, garlic and
soome lovely tomatoes.
And what exactly can you cook with
the VegBag? Let’s be honest, winter
has arrived. After a long day of lec-
tures, problem sheets and tutorial, all
we want to do is to have some hearty
warm food and watch the One Show.
(Okey, none of us at Imperial will be
back at home at 7pm, perhaps just in
time for EastEnders repeat at 10...)
One of the traditional winter dishes
are pies. The English have been enjoy-
ing meat pies since the Middle Ages
and there was even a poem written
about it in the 14th century. With the
lovely vegetables from the Veg Bag, it
was easy to make a healthy shepherd’s
pie - which in fact dates back to 1870s!
Ingredients: (Serves 4-5)
- Olive oil
- 3 garlic gloves, peeled and ﬁnely
chopped
- 3 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
- 500g lamb mince
- 2 large potatoes
- 3 carrots, chopped
- 2 sticks of celery, chopped
- 400g chopped tomatoes
- 1 red onion, peeled and chopped
- 110g butter
- 200ml milk
- 250g grated cheese
Preheat the oven to 200o
C. Heat the
olive oil in a large saucepan over a me-
dium heat and add garlic, chilli, onion,
celery and carrots. Cook on the me-
dium heat for about 5 mins until soft.
Up the heat and add the mince when
the vegetables are soft. Cook for an-
other minute.
Add Worcestershire sauce and
tomotoes, season well.
Cook for up to an hour - the longer
you cook it, the more meaty and
delicious it will taste!
While the meat is bubbling away,
bring a large pan of water to the boil
and add the potatoes. Cook until soft,
around 15-20 mins, depending on the
size.
Drain and mash well, add the butter
and milk, season with salt and pepper.
Pour the meat sauce into a large ov-
enproof dish. It should ﬁll about half
the dish.
Carefully spoon the mashed potatoes
over the top.
Season, then sprinkle with grated
Cheddar cheese.
Place on a baking ray in the oven for
30-40 mins until golden and bubbling.
To go with my shepherd’s pie, I also
stir fried some of the kale with oil and
garlic - couldn’t be simpler!
And there you have it! And if you
don’t like lamb, you can also use mince
beef to make a cottage pie. You can
also add diﬀerent vegetables into the
pie, such as mushrooms and peas. The
opportunities really are endless!
Winter: Prime Time For Pies
Seven More Years of chocolate eating
Soaring demand in emerging markets meets lower production
It is the London Chocolate Week
this week and many chocolate-related
events took place across the capital.
While the public is enjoying the new
variety of chocolate, the industry ex-
perts who met at the British Library
have some bad news for the chocolate
lovers. They predicted the world will
oﬃcially run out of cocoa beans on
October 2, 2020 - that is in 7 years’
time.
Chocolate taster and expert Angus
Kennedy reportedly said there will be
a chocolate shortage in the near fu-
ture since experts have projected that
2.3 globes worth of land is required
to accommodate the world’s needs of
chocolate. Kennedy also mentioned
that much of the space used for cocoa
production are replaced by rubber
plantation as farmers get a better
yield.
On top of that, major cocoa pro-
duction countries has experienced
bad weather, along with growing
demand has led to a 17% increase
in cocoa over the past 12 months
- which contributes to the rise of
chocolate bar production cost by 25%
in the same period.
In fact, the demand for cocoa beans
is so high that it is now the second
best prfomer in the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials, after
oil. Euromonitor International has
estimated that global sales volume
of chocolate confectionery will gain
2% this year and 2014. BRIC contries
takes a major role in this growth, de-
mand in China is projected to expand
11% annually in the next 5 years, 13%
in Brazil, 22% in India and also 8% in
Eastern Europe.
So next time when you want a
Mars Bar with your cup of coﬀee,
you might have to pay more than you
think!
