FRIDAY 18 OCT
COMMENT
Ralph Miliband: A Benefactor of Slander
Christy Kelly
Writer
T
he recent Daily Mail ‘essay’
(to use Daily Mail sketch
writer Quentin Letts’
wonderful euphemism) on
Professor Ralph Miliband
has demonstrated once more, in no
uncertain terms, the vicious and
quite frankly lunatic nature of some
elements of the British Press. They
have, quite rightly, come under the
strictest censure and condemnation
for what can only be described as
a hateful and fear-ﬁlled piece. On
the other hand (this is not to defend
‘The Mail’ in any way) I could hardly
describe the article as a ‘smear’.
That the article was written to vilify
is in no doubt. The actual result has
been, on the other hand, positive.
After all the Mail has introduced
us all (be honest, how many of you
knew of Marxist academic Ralph
Miliband last month?) to an erudite
and redoubtable intellect. Some of the
Mail’s statements sound like praise,
at least to my ears, be it “Miliband
was taught politics by Harold Laski,
a giant of Labour’s Left” or “He was
already on his way to becoming a
heavyweight thinker”, and I positively
envy both the position of his grave
(just twelve yards from that of Karl
Marx!) and the subdued eloquence of
his epitaph ‘Writer Teacher Socialist’.
The Mail’s argument does not make
sense; ﬁrst they attack Professor
Miliband as a dangerous socialist
espousing a ‘poisonous ideology’,
then they criticise some dubious
tax aﬀairs (an issue that is genuinely
concerning) as “hardly the behaviour
of a tax-loving socialist.” This reminds
me a little of Freud’s old broken kettle
joke: I ﬁnd that a kettle I had lent to
a neighbour is now broken. They
explain that: 1) they had returned the
kettle undamaged; 2) the kettle was
broken when they received it; and 3)
they never borrowed the kettle oﬀ me
anyway. The Mail’s argument lacks the
sophistication for three excuses: You
get the point.
More important than internal
inconsistencies in the Mail, however,
(or indeed the negative attitude
behind the article itself, which is, let
us be honest, simply business as usual
for a rag) is the manner in which the
Mail has been criticised. The ﬁrst is
the remarkable inanity of the very
criticism that “it’s unfair to attack
a dead man”. This may be so, but I
would suggest dead people do need
vilifying, not least Lord Northcliﬀe,
founder of the Daily Mail. “Seventeen
year olds write stupid things”. Yes,
they do, but the excerpt quoted by
the Mail seems reasonable – we must
not forget that Britain still has the
most disgraceful colonial record in
history, despite the attempts of the
Japanese, the Belgians, the Americans
etc. Finally, who really cares whether
someone hates ‘their’ country or not?
The second would be the remarkable
consensus across political parties
about the incorrectness of the Mail.
There is evidence that The
Conservative Party (despite Vince
Cable’s warnings) are still human,
perhaps a sign, even, that the entire
political class is able to transcend the
petty rivalries of partisan politics and
achieve a ‘third way’ perspective on
both matters of ‘national importance’
and basic human ‘decency’. It is when
we arrive at this conclusion that alarm
bells ring.
The ﬁrst point of concern was made
in an otherwise deeply stupid article
by Tim Stanley in the Telegraph
(an article that, relying only on ad
hominem and tu quoque, compared
the journalistic integrity of the Mail
and the Guardian), noting that the
Mail has given ample reason for the
Government to push forward moves
for press regulation. The point was
brought home to me by Tory MP
Grant Shapps, whose approach on
question time left me musing that ‘‘the
MP doth protest too much, methinks.’’
The second point was already being
made by none other than Ralph
Miliband in his 1977 book, Marxism
and Politics: “In the liberal view of
politics, conﬂict exists in terms of
Confessions of a GTA: Part Two
S
adly, this is true. In fact it
is an acronym for ‘graduate
teaching assistant’. You
know, the ones standing
at the front chatting to
the professors instead of helping you
out. Yep, I’m one of those and as far
as I’m aware we do not steal cars,
only solutions to questions when
the lecturers truly overestimate
our abilities. We do not get chased
down by cops but by students in the
last minute of a two hour tutorial,
deciding that they don’t understand
the entire subject so far. And we don’t
go to glamorous parties. Well okay,
maybe we do...
On the other hand, this week we
found out in our training that we do
something pretty cool. GTA training is
compulsory for all students wanting to
help out. If you don’t go, you don’t get
paid, which of course means we all go
but our interest is obviously driven by
wanting to assist the future Imperial
graduates. We are just those kind of
people. It is three hours; what could
they have to say that could possibly
take that long?
Well, there is a lot of jargon, like
learning styles: after a questionnaire,
I turned out to be a reﬂective, visual,
sequential, sensor learner. These are
words meaning that I like to learn with
pictures, not words, in an organised
manner by learning step by step, not
as part of a group. How I got through
Imperial I have no idea! Apparently
they cater for the completely opposite
person. This strange species are
active and intuitive. They like dealing
with lots of theory in text and enjoy
working with other people. The test
basically said that I was, in eﬀect a
genius, as I managed to do a course
taught entirely wrong for me. This
clearly did not surprise me.
What did surprise me is the
university’s opinion of us. They see us
the front line of student interaction.
We are the shield that stops students
totally embarrassing themselves by
asking a stupid question of a slightly
crotchety lecture, who has had all
their solutions stolen by some post-
grad. We stand doggedly in the cold
and wet preventing students walking
into large machinery on ﬁeld trips. We
guide them through the ﬁrst few days
of hellish programming where nothing
make sense and 1+1 no longer seems
to work according to the computer.
We are on the front line of feedback
to tell students what isn’t and what is
deﬁnitely a stupid question.
Thus, we may not be manic gamers
convinced that what Felix really needs
is a low down on what we do in a
virtual reality each week, but we do
have our uses. So next time you see
us chatting away at the front, ask us a
question, because if there is one thing
GTAs are good at is answers; we stole
the solutions. The GTA
“GTA does not stand for Grand Theft Auto!”

‘problems’ to be ‘solved’. The hidden
assumption is that conﬂict does not,
or need not, run very deep.’’ This
is always the assertion on a ruling,
complacent class and it is with only a
little exaggeration that I claim every
ground-breaking political advance
in history has been based on the
notion of antagonism and committed
struggle.
This is why I see the recent
‘polarization’ of politics as a good
thing; for all his faults (and they are
many) Ed Miliband has ﬁnally started
a movement away from that ﬁctional
‘centre’. ‘Fictional’, I say because of
Tariq Ali’s point about an ‘extreme
centre’, extreme because this ‘centre’
unquestioningly accepts principles
that good ‘centrists’ like Margaret
Thatcher had to ﬁght tooth and nail
for. The recent anti-Blairite ‘witch-
hunt’ is also a good thing by my
book (if that is really what it is) and if
accompanied by a change in face is an
equivalent change in policy.
I mentioned earlier that it was
to the credit of the Mail that they
had revived Professor Miliband for
another generation. He is perhaps
the one subject whose actuality has
been somewhat eﬀaced in the whole
discussion, appropriated as it has
been for political purposes (not least
by myself). It is therefore with great
admiration that I close with the ﬁnal
lines Professor Miliband’s own short
encomium to the aforementioned
Harold Laski in New Left Review:
‘‘Philip Rieﬀ has a nice phrase about
Freud having ‘disturbed the sleep of
mankind’. No such large claim can
be made for Harold Laski. But he
did greatly disturb the sleep of many
people in Britain and the United States
in the thirties and forties. He was an
exemplary public intellectual. There is
great need for more such intellectuals
on the Left today”.
“That the article
was written to
vilify is in no
doubt. The actual
result has been,
on the other hand,
positive.”
