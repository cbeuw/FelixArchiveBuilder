FRIDAY 18 OCT
22
THE GRADUATE
So, you’re
graduating!
Congratulations from
the Vice Provost
Education
Professor Debra Humphris
Vice Provost (Education)
Commemoration Day is one of the most exciting dates in my diary. It is
fantastic to see the South Kensington Campus ﬁlled by returning students
and proud relatives and friends. There are over 2,000 people graduating
but that impressive number shouldn’t obscure the individual achievements
of each and every graduand who will be sitting in the Royal Albert Hall.
I’d like to thank all of you for many the diﬀerent ways you’ve contributed
to, and shaped, College life during your time here. I hope you see this as
simply a new chapter in your continuing relationship with Imperial, as
you take the skills you’ve developed, the experiences you’ve had and the
friendships you’ve made into a bright and successful future.
Very best wishes
Debra Humphris

“We’ve just got to
make sure we lift
ourselves and finish
what we set out to
do. We have to keep
our standards high
and make sure we
give it everything
we’ve got.”
So, youʼve survived the Imperial Maze!
Congratulations! Finishing your degree
is a huge achievement, especically when
youʼre at Imperial.
Today will undoubtedly be an interesting
day, full of a wide range of emotions,
happiness, sadness, excitement and
nostalgia, and for a chosen few, a
longing to return to the academic world.
Regardless of how you spend your last
time as a graduand we hope that this
pullout will stay with you. Weʼve got lots
of information about post-university life
as well as a few tips to help you make
the most out of the Commemoration Day
festivities.
We hope you have great day, one that
you will be able to remember for years
to come.
Happy Commemoration Day Class 2013!
