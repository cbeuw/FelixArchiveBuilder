Scandal: Season 2
2012-13 Television
T
here is absolutely nothing
Olivia Pope (Kerry Wash-
ington) and her team of
fast-talking crisis manage-
ment consultants can’t han-
dle. Pope rocks her flawless outfits,
speed-walks everywhere, goes in and
out of The White House as if it was
her holiday pad, always with a clear
strategy in mind, and ultimately she
getsthingsdone.Handlingthepress?
Done. Getting ahead of your op-
ponents? Check. Helping the next
President-hopeful secure his votes?
Of course. She sure must charge big
bucks for her services and she’s cer-
tainly worth every penny of it.
As with any Shonda Rhimes dra-
ma, Scandal too, has a flair for the
dramatics, and loves to take absurd
ideas and turn them into feverishly
entertaining guilty-pleasure. Pope’s
affair with President Fitzgerald
Grant III (Tony Goldwyn) was es-
tablished early on in season 1, in the
show’s pilot no less, but the follow-
up season takes on a whole new level
of scandalous (pardon the pun), as
Pope’s past involvement in a deep-
level political conspiracy comes back
to haunt her.
Whereas the first season was
mostly episodic in nature, the series
renewal must have given the writers
confidence to build in a large season-
long story-arc into the show, thus
forever ending episodes in cliffhang-
ers, making its ever-growing audi-
ence figure beg for even a minute
more of the next episode. Olivia’s big
secret involving several powerful fig-
ures in the government is the main
focus, and the more ridiculous eve-
rything gets, the more irresistible the
show becomes. Almost everyone is
somehow connected in this vast de-
ception, and remember the season 1
finale in which Quinn Perkins’ (Katie
Lowes - increasingly more useful as
the series progresses) identity was
left up in the air? This is also a part of
what Olivia is trying to keep buried.
It’s no secret the show wouldn’t
be able to survive without Wash-
ington’s non-stop confidence and
charisma, which explains her Emmy
nomination for her work on the se-
ries (although her deserving win was
snatched up by Claire Danes). No
matter how ludicrous the dialogue,
no matter how uncomfortably inva-
sive the close-up, Washington truly
is a force to be reckoned with, and
not many actors would be able to
handle the dizzying amount of ma-
chine-gun-like script constantly fir-
ing off words in endless arguments.
Pope’s team of self-proclaimed
“gladiators” consist of Harrison
Wright (Columbus Short), Abby
Whelan (Darby Stanchfield), Huck
(Guillermo Díaz) and Quinn - all of
them doing their bit to chime into
the rapid game of who can say the
most words as dramatically as pos-
sible in the least amount of time,
and it’s not only her employees who
can speak like there’s no tomorrow.
Within The White House itself is an
internal power struggle that is hap-
pening that involves the President,
his Chief of Staff Cyrus Beene (Jeff
Perry), the First Lady Mellie Grant
(Bellamy Young), and the Vice-
President, the bible-bashing, rigor-
ous Christian Sally Langston (Kate
Burton) who is constantly plotting to
overtake the Presidency. All of them
truly excellent in their roles, mak-
ing their endless juicy drama all the
more watchable.
The constant plot twists and re-
veals make it difficult at times to
fully keep up with everything that is
going. Someone you believed to be
a traitor one week is quickly exon-
erated the next, and the entire plot
moves at warp-speed. Those who
don’t appreciate the pathetic Presi-
dent of the United States never com-
ing to grips and always aiming his
tired puppy eyes to Olivia will not
find their little high-school romance
drama in the least bit entertaining to
watch, but “Scandal” has a whole lot
more to offer that more than makes
up for the little strands that it could
do without. It’s no wonder the sec-
ond season finished with a record-
breaking high in terms of ratings and
audience number. Pope & Associates
are here to stay, and they’ll keep fix-
ing problems, half of which will no
doubt be their own doing through
reckless lifestyle choices.
