CAREERS
I
’m currently a Finance graduate
on the Unilever Future Leaders
Program (UFLP). At Imperial I
studied Physics (MSci) which
isn’t necessarily the most
intuitive career ﬁt. Not really having
any ﬁnancial background hasn’t
been a hindrance though, where the
view is you can learn ﬁnance, but
your attitude and way of approach
is something you as an individual
bring to the table. As I’m sure a lot of
studentsatImperialﬁndwhenitcomes
to making your ﬁrst career choice, it’s
incredibly tempting to go and work for
a big city bank or continue into further
study. I personally wanted to work in
an interesting sector that made a real
tangible impact on peoples everyday
lives. Not many companies can say
over 2 billion people use one of their
products on any given day. Unilever
could, and that’s something I wanted
to be a part of.
My ﬁrst role on the UFLP is business
partnering for Brand Building in Ice
Cream. I’m going to say right now
that this is literally the most fun thing
I’ve ever done. I work with brand
managers every day to make sure that

the decisions we make together have
the greatest impact they can, as if we
were spending our own money. When
you consider we own brands such as
Ben & Jerry’s, Walls, Magnum etc you
begin to realise that the responsibility
you’re given from day one eﬀects how
well we do in such a competitive and
large category. I cannot stress enough
how much this job is basically the
win-win scenario of corporate ﬁnance
without “selling your soul.”
When applying for the job, like any
job, it’s important to highlight your
strengths as a rounded individual. It’s
hard to come across arrogant when
you simply talk through a experience
or story which you know like the back
of your hand. It’s also important to
relate these narratives to the core
competencies of the company you’re
applying for. Unilever has 5 and in
every answer to a question I thought
about not only how to answer the
competency they’re asking for, but
the other 4 as well. Many people are
well rounded, especially if you’ve
been active outside of academia, and
it’s just as important to demonstrate
this as it is to align with a company’s
core competencies. As always it’s
also a wise idea to read as much
about the company as possible. I
had Google alerts set up just on the
word “Unilever” for example. What’s
also important is how you highlight
that as a student from Imperial
(predominantly STEM) you have
strong analytical reasoning and logical
approach. In fact I’d say that this is
the strongest thing my degree gave
me, so be sure to draw from it.
In the future I look forward to
working in diﬀerent parts of the
organisation, working on both a
global and national level. There’s
also potential to work abroad, which
in itself bring a new challenge and
breadth of experience. I’d highly
recommend applying now if you’re
interested in working on something
diﬀerent yet career building.
Unilever invest a lot in you (for
example paying for you to qualify in
CIMA) and this in turn really helps
place you in a great position by the
end of the scheme, where you’re
placed in a management position.
