T
hink back to the
person that accepted
that place at Imperial
College and compare
them to the one
reading this column today. I
can say, without a doubt, that
these will be two very diﬀerent
people- the former may very
well have been slightly awkward,
anxious and overly excited.
On accepting this place you
probably heard rumours about
the impossibly heavy workload,
how diﬃcult the course was
going to be, and perhaps you
doubted yourself. Today is
the day that you can proclaim
that you triumphed over all of
that- the person reading this
column today is now a fully
formed Imperial Graduate-
highly skilled, well rounded and
exceptionally employable, and
now even more excited, at the
prospect of taking on the world.
It is important to recognise
that this journey was not solely
one of academic achievement.
Along the road you will have
formed numerous bonds: in
your hall of residence, with your
year/faculty group, with your
club or society. It is important
to note that the Union, as well
as the College, facilitated these
exchanges- it brought you
together as a true community,
equipped with a voice and
empowered. This community
will have connected you with
like-minded people, allowed
you to explore your passions,
and to shape yourself into the
type of person that you truly
wanted to become. I wish this
newly developed person the
best of luck in their exploration
of what is to come.
I
t’s the end of an era as
for many of us university
plays a deﬁning part in our
moulding. It is with mixed
emotions that one must
say goodbye to one’s beloved
university but an end is where
a new beginning is born. A new
world waits out there, where it
is more than just exam grades,
more than solving equations or
coursework deadlines.
No matter what your degree
result is, it neither deﬁnes
success nor you. The building
blocks of success are within
all of you and it is up to you to
ﬁnd a way to build the wall with
decency and dignity. In that
journey, don’t be afraid to fail.
It is impossible to live without
failing unless you have lived
cautiously all along. In which
case, you haven’t lived at all and
thus have failed by default.
I am sure many are happy to
ﬁnally leave this institution but
like many before us; we will
be a part of it as much as it is
a part of us. There is no better
way to feed one’s nostalgia
than through the Royal College
of Science Association, the
alumnus group for RCSU
students. It’s a fantastic way to
keep in touch with your former
classmates and Imperial College
itself. They will be running
various events through the
year including annual alumni
dinners. Please visit www.rcsa.
org.uk to ﬁnd out more.
Best of luck to you all.

Hearty congratulations to all
graduates of the CGCU! Time really
ﬂies and you’re now a fully-ﬂedged
engineer. Over the coming months,
you’ll have to come to terms with
the question: “How did I manage to
accomplish so much over the past
few years at Imperial?” A great sense
of fulﬁlment must come from all
the knowledge and skill sets you’ve
acquired, and even more so when you
consider how much you’ve grown
as a person during your time with
us. Such a wonderful feeling is well-
deserved given all you’ve undergone
as an Imperial student, pushing you
beyond your limits. This, I strongly
believe, has prepared you to face any
challenge you’re about to encounter
out there.
With all the rich experiences and
insightful advice they have to share,
don’t underestimate the value our
alumni can bring to your working life.
TheCity&GuildsCollegeAssociation
(CGCA), the largest constituent
college alumni body of Imperial,
now has more than 4,000 members
around the world from a myriad of
professions. Joining the CGCA after
graduating is an excellent way to
forge and maintain links with other
members. Its informal network
can prove extremely worthwhile
as a source of information and
contacts in this increasingly
fragmented commercial world. For a
membership fee no more than that of
a college society, you will also receive
biannually a copy of the Association’s
Journal, “The Imperial Engineer”, gain
access facilities at the New Cavendish
Club and enjoy a full range of social,
networking and re-union events.
Finally, let me share a quote from
Ralph Emerson which truly embodies
my sentiments and sincere wishes for
all of you: “Do not go where the path
may lead; go instead where there is
no path and leave a trail.”
I bid every one of you Godspeed and
may you always stay positive, keep
an open mind, and ﬁnd for yourself
the drive and determination to
enrich the lives of your peers in all
possible ways.”

congratulations
are in order for
all Royal School
of Mines students
due to graduate in the upcoming
commemoration day ceremony!
I hope that the past three or four
years have left you with only the
fondest memories of the RSM.
You have helped support the
RSMU student body by being
active social members who took
pleasure in getting to know
students of all ages and showing
true RSM spirit at all the events
through the years.
Now, the good times don’t
stop here. The applied nature
of the science and engineering
degrees gained from the Royal
School of Mines departments of
Earth Science and Engineering
and Materials lead into a wide
range of industries, careers and
research; RSM graduates can
be found on all corners of the
globe, both in bustling cities and
in the back of beyond. The skills
you have gained during your
time at Imperial will be used to
beneﬁt the world in all aspects
of modern life, from resource
extraction to the creation of
groundbreaking technologies
and products.
In the future, when you are
all super successful and have
incredible life stories to tell you
can reconnect with your fellow
graduates and reminisce about
the great times you had and the
memories you made here. As
you all know, you will be missed
and are welcome back any time.
Congratulations again, you
should be so proud.

h e t h e r
you are
qualifying
as a full-
f l e d g e d
MBBS Doctor or a PubMed-
savvy Bachelor of Science, I wish
to congratulate you on achieving
a considerable milestone in
your life so far. Even if you are
not graduating, make sure you
embrace the euphoria of this
year’s Commemoration Day,
as it won’t be long before it is
you having the constant fear of
being labelled as THAT student
who tripped up on stage.
Although it is a relatively young
alumni networks at Imperial,
the ICSM Alumni Association
in recent years has gained a lot
of momentum and with their
help, there is now additional
support for our clubs and
societies as well as blossoming
joint projects on career advice
and academic tutoring between
students and alumni. So if you
haven’t already, please consider
giving back by joining the ICSM
Alumni Association.
For those who are leaving us, I
dearly hope you have enjoyed
your time with us. As a parting
message on behalf of everyone
at ICSM, I would like to thank
each and every one of you for
your fantastic contribution to
life at the medical school and
at Imperial. You have all helped
to shape ICSM as the medical
school we are so proud to be
a part of. You will be sorely
missed and I wish you the very
best of luck with your careers
and I have no doubt in your
future successes.
Steve
