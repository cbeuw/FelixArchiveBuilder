S
o as we embark on a new
term of matches, drinking
and drunkenness I feel there
is now a predictability to
sports life. I would suggest
that most final scores could be pre-
dicted before the start of the match by
a punter and s/he would soon be rich.
Imperial teams either seem to be win-
ning or losing. For those doing a bit of
both they know who they will beat and
they know who they will lose to.
Can I urge the winning ways to be
kept up and I urge that some ‘dog’ is
shown for those tougher matches.
When I say dog I mean show some
bite, some passion and the desire to
get out there and piss on the bonfire
of those cocky league leaders. It is all
very well playing, losing and then mak-

A rant now was
predictable, no?
ing the gripes about their lack of UCAS
points, but in my view we must get out
there and grow some balls.
The reason I say all this is not nec-
essarily because I think that all teams
at Imperial are losers who don’t have
enough belief in themselves to win, but
because there is a is a growing inter-
est in the spectacle that is Varsity, the
great showcase for sport at Imperial
College whose athletic reputation is
getting better all the time.
However there is some predictabil-
ity involved and I would like that to
change, partly to make the day more
interesting and to make the time and
money invested worthwhile. Who
wants to pay to spend a day watching
amateur predictable sport. I already
have a TV and a Rocky DVD.
The Battle of Bosworth Field, 22 Au-
gust 1485. The Battle of Edgehill, 23
October 1642. The Battle of Gettys-
burg, 1 July 1863. Add to this list of
great civil war battles The Battle of
Harlington, 13 December 2008. With
contrasting fortunes so far in ULU Di-
vision 1, Imperial 4s and 5s took to the
astroturf of Fortress H on an inclement
December Saturday.
The build up to the match had been
tinged with gamesmanship, with the 4s
clamouring to rearrange. Possibly run-
ning scared of a highly motivated and
capable 5th team, possibly demand-
ing extra time to find their way to the
venue. Even with the postponement, 4s
captain Jeremy didn’t take to the pitch,
his underwear still brown after the
shanking from his 5s counterpart Ron
in the reverse fixture.
The 5s started well, Lobster setting
the tone with an outrageous flick over

was coping easily with the threat of
Gui “The Barrel” Barbosa and his even
fatter, even more Brazilian mate up
front who was soon substituted for Ci-
aran. Mike Turrell’s relentless running
on the left wing was causing problems
and Tom Adams was a proving hand-
ful for Dyke Allen and Marqueef. The
5s dominance was particularly evident
in the centre where Matty Smith and
Jonny Hill were being bossed by Ron,
Marvin from JLS and Jam Jam. They
were however finding it hard to break
down the two banks of four and test
rugby fan Skeen in the 4s goal.
The pressure soon paid off though
when a clearance from the Lapin was
inexplicably left by both Dyke and the
Queef and Tom Adams was in like a
flash to slot past the schoolboy. The
4s were shaken and their centre halves
then contrived to gift the 5s another
goal. Ron chased a lost cause on the
right and managed to pull the ball back
to the edge of the six yard box. Calls of
“Clear it!” from Skeen were ignored by
Marqueef who smashed the ball into
his own top corner. 2-0.
At half-time Jeremy made his last
two substitutions and a tactical reshuf-
fle, trying to find some penetration on
their left, where Winehands and X-fac-
tor winner Dan Abooby were solid in
both defence and attack. The 4s started
brightly but were no danger for the 5s
who’s back 4, aided by Paulie in goal,
soaked up everything thrown at them.
The conditions then came into play
as a through ball was collected by Paul,
only for it to slip from his grasp and
fall to Mamzi Iscariot who put the ball
into the empty net. Paul immediately
redeemed himself coming out to meet
Ciaran and make a top class one-on-
one save with his chin.
The 5s continued to press, know-
ing their lead had undeservedly been
halved, and Ron was put clean through
only to be denied by a smart save by
Skeeno.
The 5s were then given a corner
which Jonny Hill, possibly thinking
how to get the dribbled grease from his
KFC family bucket off his 22s tie, pro-
ceeded to put straight behind the goal.
This however was missed by referee
Chav, who had been bullied by the 4s
all afternoon, and the ball swung back
into play to be headed in by Sang at the
back post.
The goal stood and the 5s were left
incredulous. Given the nature of the
two goals conceded, the 5s could easily
have let their heads drop, not a phe
