A
nother week and another
edition of Coffee Break.
Loyal readers it is a good
time to sit down, have a
few beers and begin your
collection of top trump cards! Oh yes,
this could be the next big thing to hit
the round faces of kids all over the na-
tion. I am telling you now Wizards of
the coast... BACK THE FUCK OFF!
I wont let you turn this popular card
game and turn it into something hid-
eous like Magic the Gathering. Seri-
ously if I find you guys have totally
ripped me off, I will personally hunt
you down and mutilate your soon to be
corpse with a rusty spoon. Try it and
see. That’s right!
On to a more affectionate point. I
love Chaz Murdoch. I’ve said it now,
and I’m not ashamed. Obviously not
in a man on man way, but in a “man
this guy does so much for me” kind of
way. In case you were wondering, he
is related to the guy from the A Team.
Maybe that’s why he manages to get so
much stuff done down here in the of-
fice. I waltz in on a Wednesday, have
a look at what needs to be done in this
weeks issue, and to my surprise I find
all the puzzles done. Yes I am still sur-
prised every week. My thanks go to
Coffee Break

Ravi Pall
Coffee Break Editor
this guy for all the work he puts in. Not
only does he do the puzzles, he helps
out with any other loose ends that need
to be finished before the paper goes to
print on a Thursday evening.
Concerning any ladies out there, you
can see Chaz’s “aluring” physique in
last weeks centrefold, which is current-
ly plastered all over the temporary wall
in the da vinci’s bar. He’s winning the
hot or not poll by a landslide against
Hockey 1st
team captain, Jack Cornish.
Chaz likes to ride motorbikes for fun,
with a collection of various high end
vehicles to mount. He is also the ACC
vice chairman. Ever wondered who or-
ganised all those great ACC bar nights
in the union? It’s Chaz. We salute you
sir. Carry on the good work.
“I love Chaz”

Virgo
Phil Collins has been
in court recently for
indecent exposure of
his voice to millions
of people. There
you are, humming
along happily to a bit of Dido and this repulsive
crooning comes on. You want to destroy the
radio, but you know that he’s not worth it.
This situation will happen at your next group
meeting when the idiot in the corner pipes up.
Scorpio
If it’s your Birthday
this week, we all wish
you many happy
returns. If it’s not,
then we don’t. When
you go out celebrat-
ing don’t get so beered that you end up in a skip
with a dirty old man “taking advantage of the
situation.” It’s not going to be a pleasant time for
you- trust me I’ve been there. Well I enjoyed it,
the other party present didn’t quite as much.
Libra
This week things
might not turn
out the way you
really wished. But
don’t worry or beat
yourself up it could
well be a blessing in disguise. You get to hang
out with you bros, which is pretty much the
perfect recipe for any human. On the other
hand, hanging about college too much could
make you go proper mental!
Capricorn
There are women
in the felix office
recently. Lots of
them. And they
actually want to
be here! Amazing.
If any very boisterous, larger swilling beasts
want to come down to even up the balance I
would be much obliged. In the words of the
18th century philosopher Ali Philpott “who
needs women? Women are for gays.” Pint?
Sagittarius
There seems to be
a lot of aggression
kicking around the
world at present
and it’s going to rub
off onto you. When
things begin to well up, put the kettle on,
make a cup of tea, sit down and listen to a Cat
Stevens record. Better still listen to the whole
album. felix has a lovely selection of his finest
works which you can browse through anytime.
Cancer
A riot breaks out in
the Physics common
room over who
is more sexually
attractive, Newton
or Galileo. Things
quickly escalate and before long people are
tumbling from the 7th floor. This is crazy
behaviour, but in the court case the judge
realises that you are crazy people. Who else
would want to study Physics at Imperial?
Gemini
Lectures don’t go
too well for you. You
repeatedly arrive
late and make a
fucking din as you
get to your seat.
Enraged a bloke at the back jumps up points
out that you are definitely not on time and
smashes you right in the face. You fall arse over
tit down the theatre and end up in a heap of
the floor at the lectures feet. He kicks you.
Leo
The fun police.
Who the fuck do
you think you are?
If I want to play
conkers, I will. If I
get a conker in the
nads, it’s going to hurt but I’m not a batty. Man
up, put a jumper on and stop crying like big
gay babies. Health and safety can take its rules
and regulations and shove them up their arse
because I ain’t doing that shit.
Taurus
This week you
get caught in a
compromising
position in the
Men’s toilets of the
Union building.
After a minor skirmish, the door to the toilet
is removed where you are found with you
wang out businessing a girl. After a wait of five
minutes you move off to another cubicle and
begin again. Next time use the disabled.
Aries
Why don’t you
shut up and leave
me alone? Yes
you. Having a
conversation with
you is like kicking a
cripple- it’s just not fair. I am struggling to get
over the embarrassment of belonging to the
same race as you. On a good day you are a half
wit, please bugger off... If you don’t know who
I am talking about, it’s you.
Pisces
This week you are
strangely happy,
unsure as to why but
I can guarantee you
that this is only the
start. Things will get
even better, culminating in an epic exchange
of saliva on the dance floor of dB’s with that
special someone that you’ve been drooling
over. My advice to you is to take it slowly and
let the relationship blossom.

Aquarius
Mate, this part is
well shit bruv innit?
So felix hollared
me up and asks me

stylee. So here goes man! Your week is gunna

Istanbul, seriously heavy dude!
This week, felix got MC Melo-D from Blazing Squad down for advice. Fortunately he could only do one
FUCWIT
League Table
Right then, the Felix University/College-Wide Invitational Tourna-
ment League is officially back, and it’s about time we explain what
the hell is going on.
Basically, you get points for doing all the various puzzles and chal-
lenges, and at the end of the year, the winning team will win an iPod
nano! Pretty cool right? The scoring is as follows:
5 points for the first correct answers for Slitherlink, Wordoku, Lon-
don Underground and Quickie. 4 points for second, 3 points for
third, 2 points for fourth and 1 point for fifth.
Double points will be awarded for correct cryptic crossword an-
swers, because it’s über hard.
Simple! Now then FUCWITs, send in your answers to felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk or sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Go!

As promised there were no cock
ups here... shame about the
Cryptic,butI’vealreadyshouted
at Enoch for that. And now he’s
crying. Anyhoo, winners this
week were MÖchten sie mein
Manschaft? who are streaking
away at the top of the table.
Double points are still on offer
for anyone from outside the top
two so that makes the Cryptic
(if Enoch makes no mistakes)
worth an exceptional 20 points.
