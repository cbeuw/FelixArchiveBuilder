Sounds of Love are Calling
The Futureheads live at the Astoria: music.felix’ s Futureheads Correspondent Alistair
Garner braved the sweaty hordes of Tottenham Court Road to check them out
Ever since I borrowed their debut al-
bum from a friend in 2004, I have abso-
lutely loved the Futureheads. Nothing
beats singing in a Geordie accent, ex-
cept perhaps several Geordie accents
singing harmonies on top of layered
guitar riffs and drumming that never
sits still. Take all that, blend thorough-
ly and cram it in your ears at 600mph
and you’ve got the recipe for the rump
steak of live music. But forget 28 days
matured, I’d been waiting 4 years to
sink my teeth into these sumptuous,
Sunderland song-smiths.

Their name has an uncertain pronun-
ciation but on the 27th of November,
MGMT (debate rages between my-
self and Arts Editor David Paw about
whether you say ‘M.G.M.T’ or Man-
agement) delivered a flawless set to an
uncommonly civilized crowd.
Their warm-up act ‘Strangers’ failed
to do anything of the sort at the Kent-
ish Town Forum. Their generic and un-
imaginative beat-driven rock was out
of touch with the electronic sounds of
MGMT and the boredom on the faces
of skinny-jean wearing fashion stu-
dents was painfully apparent. The lead
guitarist couldn’t even destroy his gui-
tar properly, opting instead to rip off a
few strings and then throttle/rape it.
Audible sighs rippled throughout the
venue when they finally finished their
set and MGMT’s stage props were un-
veiled. A surreal landscape of cacti,
spiky grass and black and white stripes,
which was complemented by MGMT
who were dressed as Native Americans
(except for the lead singer Ben Gold-
wasser who was dressed as a Pilgrim)
in celebration of Thanksgiving).
Hits like “Time to Pretend”, “Elec-
tric Feel” and “Pieces of What” were
spaced throughout the set, forcing a
mostly clueless audience to listen to
their more musically interesting songs.
“Weekend Wars” was an electronic joy
while even though those who had nev-
er heard “The Youth” before received
its inhibition-destroying message loud
and clear and spontaneously started
hugging their friends.
Needless to say, ‘Time to Pretend’
went down well. By the look of their
frantic jumping, they couldn’t express
their excitement in an appropriately
intense fashion. Multiply that feeling
by 100 and you will get some idea of the
atmosphere in the venue when MGMT
finished their set with ‘Kids’.
With all their most popular songs
used up, it wasn’t immediately obvi-
ous what they would play as an encore.
Forget their mainstream ‘indie’ hits,
MGMT used the encore to indulge in
back to basics synth rock. For over 15
minutes they consumed themselves in
the music and for the same 15 minutes
almost nobody in the audience had
a clue what was going on. Cue fresh-
faced indie kids with their frowns con-
veying, “I thought they were going to
play “Kids” again”.
Soon after Andrew Van Wyngarden
(the second member of MGMT) fell
onto his knees in front of his synth the
gig ended. MGMT are unlikely to be-
come infamous for their live sets but
Kadhim Shubber
MGMT is in Control
they showed that they are a live band
that demands respect for both sheer
delivery and the courage to throw a
middle finger to their fans and return
to their synth roots.
It’s a mystery to me as to why Asobi
Seksu remain fairly unknown. True,
their debut didn’t really deserve a sec-
ond glance, but their second album
‘Citrus’ was a hyper-melodic explosion
of colourful dream-pop that went way
beyond my expectations to become
one of my favourite albums released
in 2007. From what they demonstrat-
ed in Hoxton’s Bar & Kitchen, it turns
out that they also put on one helluva
show.
First up on the night (and to some-
what balance an otherwise gushy re-
view), were Manhattan Love Suicides
who aren’t actually from Manhattan
and are instead from Leeds, but what-
ever. Theirs was a loud and relentless
set, a continuous barrage of inconsider-
ately bland shoegaze rock that wouldn’t
break between songs. If that was done
to make their time on stage shorter,
then it still went on for too long. Or
at least it felt that way and it wasn’t
helped by the lead singer’s seemingly
contemptuous attitude towards the au-
dience. Not once acknowledging that
there were people standing before her,
she spent the entire gig singing with
a bored expression, either staring at a
corner of the ceiling or with her back
to us. Maybe it was supposed to give
the impression of cool nonchalance, it
instead made the band look arrogant
and it smacked of the worst kind of
phoney, indie-posturing.
But anyway, we weren’t here for them,
and like those Egg credit card adverts,
Asobi Seksu were soon on stage to re-
store the natural order of the universe.
With sets of fairy lights sitting on top
of amplifiers and wrapped around
mics, their stage hasn’t changed since
they last headlined ULU back in Feb-
ruary. What has changed, however, is
their set and by wisely excising nearly
every song from their dreary debut, the
band were able to focus more on the
songs dependent on that little gizmo
synonymous with the shoegaze and
dream-pop genres: the effects peddle.
Tonnes of delay effects were served
upon extravagant helpings of reverb
threatening to push nearly all other
elements of the band’s performance
aside. James Hanna tore, plucked and
scratched at his guitar strings until a
huge fuck-off torrent of guitar fuzz
(usually accompanied by blasts of
strobe lighting), had filled every corner
of the tiny venue. It added impressive
volume and muscularity to songs like
‘New Years’ and the epic ‘Thursday’,
but the other three band members fle-
shed out all the subtleties and nuances.
Yuki Chikudate stood front and centre
on vocals and despite having Hanna
spinning about next to her (as well as
being small enough to fit in your pock-
et), she managed to remain the centre
of attention as she thrashed about on
her synths. Though her vocals may be
slightly too thin to be angelic, they’re
sweet enough and singing in Japanese,
she virtually took off on the soaring
chorus of ‘Strings’.

MGMT is pronounced “muh-guh-mut-tuh”, the french word for ‘music’
Filling the slots that those first album
tracks left vacant were previews from
their upcoming release, ‘Hush’. Unlike
the sonically dense ‘Citrus’, these new
songs sound more spacious, with Han-
na’s guitar effects scaled back to instead
favour the drum beats and Chikudate’s
vocals. Catchy and retaining ‘Citrus’s
energy, they’re a good indicator of
what’s to come when that album is
released in February ’09. But before
we could start missing the effects, the
band finished off their main set with
the double-whammy of ‘Strawberries’
and ‘Red Sea’, the latter’s roaring five
minute climax seeing Chikudate up-
rooting her drummer and thrashing
about until she looked like she could
no longer lift the drumsticks.
Leaving the strobes and fuzz on, the
band eventually came back for a two
song encore which including their de-
but’s best song, the bouncy ‘I’m Happy,
But You Don’t Like Me’. Don’t worry
Asobi Seksu, we like you. We like you
a lot.
“James Hanna

I arrived at the venue with an un-
healthy appetite for northern post-
punk, but before that came the first
course. We were served the familiar
flavours (to my palate anyway) of
classic Midlands-core, in the form of
Birmingham-based three piece Johnny
Foreigner. Their super-fast, overdriven
chords and the constant exchange of
soft crooning for incomprehensible
screaming by both male and female
vocalists was unmistakably reminis-
cent of the sound of bands like One
Toy Soldier and TANAOU from my
home town (Northampton), and I’m
sure of hundreds of bands playing in
the back rooms of pubs from Glouces-
ter to Great Yarmouth. All credit to
Johnny Foreigner for landing a spot on
tour with the Futureheads though, and
they certainly earned their place at this
show with an enjoyable, snappy set that
had their fans going crazy at the front,
and made every audience member at
the very least tap their feet.
Whilst their songs were fun to listen
to, punchy and fast-paced, the music
itself was largely forgettable, the band
relying on lyrical hooks to make their
songs catchy, but this was achieved
with great success. I found myself sing-
ing their songs on the way home after
just one listen, instead of the Future-
heads hits I’d heard hundreds of times.
Johnny’s lyrics were classic teen po-
etry, and the lead vocals of Alexei Ber-
row were suitably pained to do them
justice, but he sang with that whiney,
implacable accent that seems to afflict
so many frontmen of bands of this type.
Maybe they all came from the same
far-away planet to sing to the youth
of Great Britain. But still, you can sing
how you like when your bassist looks
like she does; you’ll still fill every venue
with teenage boys.
Then came the main event. The Fu-
tureheads entered, beaming at their
riotous reception and set about giving
the crowd what they were expecting.
They started the set rattling through
some of the best tracks from their first
two albums. ‘Decent Days And Nights’,
‘Robot’ and ‘Meantime’ from their self-
titled debut, and ‘Skip To The End’
and ‘Worry About It Later’ from News
and Tributes were all massive crowd
pleasers, played with an enthusiasm
and energy that didn’t diminish for the
whole show. It was hugely enjoyable to
see four maniacs vigorously thrashing
their respective instruments in their
individual areas of the stage, and yet
to hear the togetherness of four musi-
cians perfectly synchronised, dropping
in and out seamlessly to create their
unique, restless sound.
Later they broke out their most re-
cent singles, ‘Beginning of the Twist’
and ‘Radio Heart’, and some non-al-
bum tracks like ‘Area’, but the crowd
still sang every word. The audience
soaked up the band’s energy like their
jeans soaked up the spilt beer and
sweat from the floor, and went abso-
lutely mental on it. Their calf muscles
were tested by ‘First Day’, the band go-
ing so fast by the end that the crowd
barely had time to touch the floor in
between jumps, but they didn’t reach
a peak until they heard the familiar vo-
cal horseplay of ‘Hounds of Love’, the
Futureheads’ biggest single and clos-
ing number. Modestly, they hadn’t
withheld any of their big hits from
the main set, so when they came back
on stage, they played a proper encore
of new songs and a couple of covers,
and closed with a massive rendition of
‘Man Ray, strobe lights a plenty.
The Futureheads are an accom-
plished band but they showed us at the
Astoria that they’re still all about fun.
They had fun with the songs, fun with
each other and fun with the audience,
and whilst I can’t imagine it was as fun
for us as it was for them, I still had a
bloody good time that was well worth
the wait. Delicious.
“The audience
soaked up the
band’s energy
like their jeans
soaked up the
spilt beer and
sweat from the
floor”
Having just crawled back into the
country from ten hellish night shifts in
a bunker at the ESRF in Grenoble, the
last thing I wanted to encounter on my
return to civilisation was a French rock
band. Or a French anything. Or any-
thing that smelt even faintly of cheese.
Think French music and the first thing
that springs to mind is likely to be the
electronic weirdness of Air or Daft
Punk – neither of which is a bad band,
but I thought I was going to a rock gig.
Still, in One Way Mirror it seems I’d
stumbled onto something of a gem.
Formed as the side-project of Soil-
work’s drummer, Dirk Verbeuren, who
heroically drummed straight through
two back-to-back sets, the band gave
one of the tightest sets I’ve seen in
a while, playing an industrial brand
of dirty heavy metal. Impressively
though, especially for a band singing
in their second language, they never
strayed down the path of screaming in-
coherently and their superb front man,
Guillaume Bideau, was clearly loving
the spotlight. And it’s not every day
you get to hear a rock cover of Frankie
Goes To Hollywood’s ‘Relax’ sung in
the style of James Hetfield.
As it turned out, the main event
wasn’t bad either. Soilwork come
across like a more polished, Swedish
Killswitch Engage (anyone who’s ever
sat through that celluloid epic, Resi-
dent Evil, will know who I mean): a bit
shoutier than the support act, but bet-
ter lyrically and with a much stronger
back-catalogue. Brilliantly, despite the
band sporting the obligatory long hair,
tats and black clothing, their shaven-
headed vocalist came on wearing a
striped shirt and waistcoat, looking
like somewhere between Al Murray
and Buster Bloodvessel. Now there’s
an analogy that makes me look old...

The technical skill of the band was
something to be marvelled at: time
signatures were chopped and changed
seamlessly, the guitarists would occa-
sionally swap roles during solos and
the drummer still had all his limbs
functioning at the end of the encore,
which was a feat in itself. However,
they weren’t helped out much by the
sound levels – although One Way Mir-
ror had been crystal clear throughout,
Soilwork’s sound man clearly decided
it was much more ‘rock’ to mash eve-
rything up to 11, meaning that the
guitarists were often inaudible above
the drums and vocals and that all too
often the whole affair descended into
a kind of metal distortion fuzz. Still,
they gave a good show and you can’t
help but feel that this band should be
rocking out 3,000 people at Brixton
Academy rather than the paltry 300-
odd you can fit into Islington. Catch
the small gigs while you can.
