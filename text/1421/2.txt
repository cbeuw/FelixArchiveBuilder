Imperial Students lose out in
Foundation programmes
A
lmost 86% of final year
students from the Im-
perial College School of
Medicine [ICSM] have
been assigned their pre-
ferred foundation programme this
year. Although an improvement from
last year’s figure of 61.5%, the results
released on the 6th January 2009 are
still below the national average of 90%.
The fears raised by many students and
professionals alike is still whether or
not the new system, known as UKFPO
Version 2.0 which is the 3rd reincarna-
tion of the process since it started in
2005, is a fair process.
The national application process is
the method by which medical students
are assigned a hospital where they will
do their foundation course. In previ-
ous years, as part of their Pre-Regis-
tration House Officer [PRHO] year
(i.e. the final year of medical training
as and employee), medical students
were matched with a position in the
hospital(s) linked to their individual
medical school, however this was tech-
nically illegal as it was not consistent
with employment laws. The system
also meant that medical students could
not apply to hospitals that were not
linked to their ‘home’ school, unless
they had received permission from
the Dean of their medical school. This
particular method of job assignment
had not been legally challenged; how-
ever, when the new national selection
system came into effect, and where
the PRHO year changed into founda-
tion programme, it was inevitable that
some people would challenge the se-
lection method on a legal basis, which
the medical schools would have lost as
the law was being broken.
The General Medical Council
[GMC] had in the past recommended
that students “undertake a PRHO post
associated with [their] medical school”,
though since the new system came into
fruition, this particular line of text has
since disappeared from their literature.
In the past, it was felt by the GMC that
with students remaining with effective-
ly the same institution there would be
an educational and pastoral continuity.
In light of the fact that the ‘old system’
was illegal, it is safe to assume that the
GMC didn’t want to be endorsing an il-
legal practise.
With the introduction of a national
application, it was immediately clear
to the medical students in London that
they would suffer, since there were
more medical students in London than
actual places in hospitals. ICSM, in
the past, had links with hospitals out-
side the London area to cope with the
excess number of students, however
these places have now gone with more
and more medical schools opening.
The fact that there are more medical
schools opening is another fact that
has caused concern, due to the lack
of uniformity between the medical
schools.
When the new national application
system was introduced in 2005, known
as the Multi-Deanery Application
Process [MDAP], students applied di-
rectly for posts but a maximum of 40.
The MDAP was still not ‘national’ as it
wasn’t open to all posts in the country,
instead students could apply to one
of two ‘Units of Application’ that had
a number of schools within them. Af-
ter one year, the system was deemed
to have been a disaster. Each student
that applied to a particular post was
ranked in order to allocate the posi-
tion, yet there was no national guide-
lines for scoring, no academic rank-
ing and poor consultation with senior
medical professionals. There was ef-
fectively no process in which all the
students across the country could be
compared to. 20% of medical graduates
in the country come from London, and
in 2005, 250 London medical students
without posts, 44% of the total number
of unplaced posts. Of these 250, 39
were Imperial students and after clear-
ing 11 were still without a post; the 11
included prize-winners.
The fear that London students would
be displaced seemed to be true, and
since it was clear that the MDAP sys-
tem was not working, a new system
was devised in 2006. The Medical
Training Application Service [MTAS]
gave students the opportunity to apply
to anywhere in the country, however
they would have to apply to a founda-
tion school fist before they could apply
to an individual post. Academic rank-
ing was introduced for the first time,
with the results from that contributing
to 45% of the overall score, something
that was felt would benefit Imperial
graduates. The problem that now oc-
curred was that many of the Impe-
rial graduates who were already in the
bottom 50% of their year, didn’t see
the point in applying to a North West
Thames Foundation School [NWTFS]
where all their hospitals are located.
This resulted in fewer people applying
to a post at a NWTFS, with the lower
ranked students opting to apply to a
foundation school outside London. As
a result 92% of Imperial graduates were
allocated to their first choice of foun-
dation schools.
In 2007, the MTAS was renamed
the United Kingdom Foundation Pro-
grammes Office [UKFPO]. The previ-
ous year saw only 352 applicants for
321 posts in NWTFS, which gave the
impression to many students across
the country that it was relatively easy
to get into a NWTFS. Back in 2007,
NWTFS saw 552 applicants for a simi-
lar number of places, a figure that far
surpassed that of any other founda-
tions school. As a result, only 61.5% of
Imperial finalists got their first choice
foundation school.
With a new year and a new round
of medical students applying for posts
at foundation schools, it is time for
a change to the application process.
Points allocated from academic mer-
it decrease from 45% to 40% which
means more of an emphasis is made
on the written part. This is of great
benefit to Imperial candidates as they
have scored higher on average than
anyone else in this sector over the past
few years. On the academic front, the
scoring for Q1 has increased, giving 4
points for a 2.1 BSc, something which
most Imperial candidates have.
There is no doubt that with the in-
creased support from the ICSM Stu-
dents’ Union in the form of lectures on
filling out the application form, as well
as tactical choices made by the stu-
dents themselves, Imperial was able to
obtain a higher proportion of students
getting their first choice. What is of
main concern still, even after 4 years,
is the method by which these positions
are allocated. There is no distinction
between the qualities of students com-
ing out from the various medical stu-
dents. Effectively, people ranked in the
top quartile at Imperial are considered
exactly the same as people from an
institution that is lower in the league
tables for medicine, who are also in the
top quartile at their school. The meth-
od of teaching various from school to
school, which again means that there
will be a difference in the quality of
students graduating.
Although the results this year are
encouraging, the general consensus
across the Imperial board is that things
need to change, whether or not that is
going to happen, only time will tell.
Now in its third reincarnation, the selection process for final
year medical students has started to produce favourable results
for Imperial, but is it fair? felix Editor in Chief, Jovan Nedić,
investigates the history and what the results say this year.
What the college thinks
What ICSMSU thinks
What the students think
Professor Lord Robert Winston got the
2009 RCSU Imperial College Science
Challenge, supported by Shell, off to
a flying start last night, as he spoke at
its launch. The event was attended by
over 150 Imperial students and even
the Rector, Sir Roy Anderson, was
amongst the audience, with students
and teachers from schools across the
United Kingdom also logging in to
watch the event live online. Some even
made the journey to South Kensing-
ton to attend the event itself! Either
the free cakes and drinks on offer, or
perhaps this year’s prizes, must have
caught their attention – with the over-
all winner standing to pocket £5,000
for only 800 words!
Full details of this year’s competition
were announced at the launch by the
Chair, Jad Marrouche, PhD student and
former President of the RCSU, who is
running the event for the second time
after his many successes in 2006-2007.
The competition will follow a simi-
lar format to previous years, with the
aim being to write an 800-word essay
in answer to one of four questions, set
by a panel of judges, based on a scien-
tific topic and its effects on the wider
world. There will once again be two
categories: one for students at Imperial
College, and another, run in conjunc-
tion with Imperial Outreach, for school
students across the United Kingdom.

The Judges and the
Questions
Duncan Macleod
Vice President, Hydrogen and GTL, Shell
“Hydrogen is key to
tackling the world’s
rapidly increasing
demand for energy.
Discuss.”
Dr Martyn Sené
Acting Director of the National Physical Laboratory
“At a time when the public seems
to be increasingly distrustful of
science and technology and, indeed,
of scientists, what can be done to
ensure an informed and balanced
public and political debate?”
Professor Tejinder Virdee
Spokesperson for the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN
“What can we learn from
the Large Hadron Collider
experiment?”
“I would of course like every single one of our
students to get their first choice of job and al-
though the system is imperfect, at least our
students were less disadvantaged this year.
London has always produced more doctors than
can be accommodated for training in the capi-
tal and over the years, even before the current
system, many students did choose to start their
postgraduate training out of
London. We need to help our
students create the strongest
possible applications to in-
crease their chance of secur-
ing their preferred Foundation
placement.”
Prof. J. Higham
Head of Undergraduate
Medicine

And just when you thought that was
all, John Sanderson of the RCSA has
once again given generously to the
cause, donating once-in-a-lifetime
(non-scientific!) prizes to the winners
– two tandem flights on a paraglider
for the winning school student and two
trial lessons on a light aircraft for the
winning Imperial student…who said
science couldn’t be fun…?
passing onto each judge the top ten
essays based on their question. Each
judge will then select the winning es-
say for each of the two categories and
then all four judges will decide upon
the overall winners, who will be an-
nounced at the Grand Final event, to
be held on the 13th March at an as-yet
undisclosed location. With previous
Grand Finals including sell-out events
at The Ritz Hotel and The Science Mu-
seum, you can bet this will be one not
to miss!
The Science Challenge website has
also had an extensive re-development
and is now available, complete with full
details of the competition, previous
winning essays and information about
how to enter, all of which can be found
at the conveniently named http://sci-
encechallenge.org.
“Not being a huge supporter of the UKFPO appli-
cation system, I applied feeling apprehensive and
unsure of how things would turn out especially
after last years statistics for ICSM. I received
my first choice deanery but there are still a lot
of problems in the system that need to be ad-
dressed. The computer system this year worked
and did not crash but the system for selecting
jobs seemed clumsy and once the jobs were
selected in preferences it was impossible to click
a link to observe the job details for refining your
selection. Maybe this could be reviewed for next
year.”

Imperial medical students doing their thing
“Imperial College School of Medicine Students’
Union is extremely happy that our final year
students fared better this year compared to
previous years. North West Thames Founda-
tion School is still a particularly hard school to
get into, and we, in collaboration with the other
London medical schools, are in the process of in-
vestigating how heavily skewed
the results are considering so
many final years did not apply
to our home school as a con-
sequence of last years results.
Whilst we are pleased with the
result, we will still be pushing
for educational continuity in re-
form to the allocation process.”
