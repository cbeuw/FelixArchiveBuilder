Nightlife Editor – Catherine Jones (CJ)
The Double Club is Double Cool
Two cultures coexisting in harmony? Catherine Jones reviews a very eclectic bar with a message
cultural fusion. Samples of Congolese
and Western hospitality are mixed to-
gether, and we get to enjoy the results.
The club is the brainchild of The
Carsten Holler Project by Fondazione
Prada. It does indeed look very de-
signer. The three areas of the venue
are divided equally between Congolese
and Western spaces but we spent most
of the night in the spacious courtyard
area. An eclectic mix of plastic furni-
ture, cobbles, tiles, murals and posters
demarketed the two spaces.
At 9pm the bar was half full, and we
were quickly served by the friendly
staff. The drinks menu contained a
variety of cocktails, wines and a few
beers. They were a tad on the expen-
sive side, but after all, it is in London.
Drinks in hand we headed straight to
the empty area, perching on the edge
of a swimming pool-like tiled corner.
In the background, a sound track of
Congolese music. Well, mostly Con-
golese. I was shocked to hear “I Want
to Know What Love Is” by Foreigner at

Best: Laid back vibe and
friendly staff.
Worst: Expensive drinks.

Free entry and free cloakroom
A
few weeks ago, I paid a
visit to a cultural furore
(!) of a new bar. I love
bars, especially the Un-
ion. Sometimes though,
you have to try something new. So why
not a bar-club-restaurant-and-art in-
stallation, with a unique fusion of Con-
golese and Western culture?
As per usual, the night started in
confusion, with a total failure to meet
at the right place on time. This is not
exactly surprising. The Double Club
is tucked away at the end of Torrens
Street, near Angel tube station. The
inconspicuous warehouse doors hide
behind a gazebo. Upon arrival though,
the welcome made up for it. The staff
smiled and took our coats to the free
cloakroom. We made our way through
the white arty entrance rooms, into the
courtyard bar and it just goes to show,
you never know what may be lurking
behind a door.
The Double Club concept is one of
one point during the night.
As the bar became busier at 11pm, we
checked out the discotheque room next
door. It was modestly sized, but still
very impressive. Revellers crammed
onto the rotating dance floor, while
flashing lights and mirrored disco balls
orbited above their heads.
As for music, The Double Club op-
erates an “all inclusive” music policy.
Contemporary Congolese band Sound
Africa performed earlier that night.
DJs packed out the place, alternating
sounds across cultures. The crowd em-
braced the fusion vibe, and the fusion
continued on to the dance floor. I’m
not a great dancer at the best of times,
but there were some slightly embar-
rassing blends of bad drunken dancing
to be seen that night.
The Double Club seems the ideal
kind of venue to come and chat with
friends, simply because of the relax-
ing, harmonious vibe. This may sound
cheesy, but I had an inspirational mo-
ment, turning my gaze upwards, find-
ing a full moon shining through the
glass roof. At that beautiful moment I
decided to award The Double Club 5
stars out of 5, and will consider visiting
again and again.
The Double Club is donating half
of its profits to the City of Joy
charity, supporting projects to
help abused women and children
in the Congo. So you can party
guilt free, but there is no guaran-
tee you will avoid the hangover .

know what love
is’ by Foreigner
at one point!”
