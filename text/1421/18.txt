A messy, never-the-less correct answer
from Shotgun was the first to pop up
on my screen, but due to double points
week, Giramondo stole 6 points! Get
your answers in faster for 10 lads.
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Ok, I felt very nice this week
and even though they wrote a
‘P’ instead of an ‘R’ and had the
audacity to win everything last
week, Shotgun were still first in
and took the 5 points. Next time
I will not be so lenient!
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.

Going Underground
So it worked! We had loads of respons-
es. Excellent. Well done to Shotgun
who found SOUTH KENSINGTON.
An easy one to start, this one is a little
further from home.
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned
a value, 1-26 (see table) and when add-
ed together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk and you
get FUCWIT points. For any simple-
tons, I have done you an example.

Mr & Miss Imperial 2009
With Sabbatical elections around the corner, we’re launching our own election.
Search for Miss Imperial Search for Mr Imperial
Calling all girls! This is the start of Imperial’s first ever beauty contest and
I reckon we are going to unearth some real beauties. The male dominance here causes
phrases like ‘FFI (Fit For Imperial)’ and ‘better from behind’ to come into everyday use but I
think the girls at Imperial are of an surprisingly high standard. It’s time for us to show everyone what
Imperial’s got and crown a Miss Imperial 2009!
Boys! Now’s the time to forget all that manliness and bring out
your pretty side - we’re also looking for a Mr Imperial 2009! Don’t
worry, there’s no shame - us girls want some eye candy and you get
to spend the day with Miss Imperial. So come one boys, join in!
To enter, send us 2 photographs of yourself, 1 face shot, and 1 full length shot, along with the following details: name, age, department and year of study.
The finalists will then appear in felix ready for voting to commence. Students of Imperial then decide who will be crowned!
The winners will receive: £200 shopping spree, a makeover, a photo shoot (to be featured in felix) and a iPod.
Entries need to be sent in to felix@imperial.ac.uk by Friday 6th February. Get snapping!
