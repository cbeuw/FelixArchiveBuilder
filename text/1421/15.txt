M
y trip to the US had
been very exciting.
Very exciting indeed.
Not only did I get
taken to a police sta-
tion in San Francisco and held a shot-
gun, but I also had the chance to check
out tonnes of cool new gadgets at the
CES (Consumer Electronics Show)
in Las Vegas. Frankly, the city is only
worth visiting for the show (which is
not open to the public), or if you’re into
gambling and staring at fake tits.
Apparently there were significantly
fewer visitors this year; probably only
60%oflastyear’sfigure,andweallknow
the reason. Nevertheless, new gadgets
were still pouring out over the four-day
event, which took up large floor areas
of several convention centres and ho-
tels. Here’s an idea of the event’s scale:
as a favour for a Hong Kong audiophile
magazine, I took photos of every single
room at the High Performance Audio
& Home Theatre area, which occupied
about 300 suites that took up five floors
at The Venetian, and that alone took
me two and a half days (bear in mind
I literally only snapped a few shots in
each room and didn’t sit down to listen
to the systems)! If that wasn’t enough,
I still had the Las Vegas Convention
Center (LVCC), Sands Expo, Renais-
sance and Hilton Hotel to explore!
In the remaining days I only managed
to cover some parts of the LVCC – the
main venue of the show – and Sands
Expo. As many CES regulars suggested,
I wouldn’t be surprised if it took an en-
tire month to see absolutely everything
on show. Not only were my legs knack-
ered, but my chapped lips (the harsh
winds of San Francisco didn’t play nice-
ly) and insufficient sleep also challenged
my temper. Fortunately, the sight of fun
and rare gadgets overcame my darker
thoughts, otherwise I may have made
the Vegas headlines following some sort
of mental-breakdown behaviour.
Anyway, enough moaning. Enjoy the
rest of the article!

This year there were four distinct
categories of TVs: the large, the
thin, the eco-friendly and the 3D
displays. While TV sizes had al-
ways been the main driving force of
the competition, many companies
see that eco-awareness is opening
a new market. Companies such as
Sony, Panasonic and Toshiba had
green booths comparing live power
consumption of current TV models
and new eco-friendly ones, as well
as posters pointing out the recycla-
ble materials used.
The electronic companies also
believe that 3D display is the future.
Sony was displaying their 3D mod-
els that require viewers to wear
special glasses – quite an incon-
venience for four-eyed peeps like
myself – but apparently Samsung
came up with a TV that displays
3D right out of the box. Sadly Sam-
sung was the only large booth that
I failed to get to, so I’ll make sure I
check them out next time.

Storage Media
SDXC – the next-gen SD that gives you 32GB to 2TB capacity
Now that the HD format war is
over, the spotlight is returning to
solid-state memory. As you can
see above, the SD Association an-
nounced the SDXC specification,
giving you massive storage ca-
pacities of 32GB up to 2TB on the
tiny cards, and transfer speed of
104MB/sec (up to 300MB/sec in
the future). The final specification
will be released to manufacturers
next month, so expect to see SDXC
cards and compatible devices in
stores in about three months’
time.
SanDisk made a big presence at
the show too, actively promoting
their SSD products for laptops,
notably the high-speed 240GB 2.5”
SATA-II SSD, which will be avail-
able directly from their website for
$499 by mid-2009.
SanDisk claims their latest SSDs are 5 times faster than HDDs
“Next-gen” Gaming
I came across a couple of very cool
gaming products, both of which
can be categorised as “next-gen”
gaming, since they don’t require
conventional controllers.
For example, Mattel’s Mindflex
(pictured left) consists of a small
obstacle course platform, on which
hovers a small purple ball support-
ed by air blown from below, and the
player controls the strength of the
fan with his/her mind (theta-wave
activity detected by a head band),
and the X-Y coordination control-
led by hand. Not bad for $80, huh?
Another cool technology that the
game industry should look into is
GestureTek’s 3D gesture recogni-
tion. As pictured on the right, a
camera captures live 3D images
and translates gestures into instruc-
tions – in this case, steering and ac-
celeration of a virtual car (moving
the fists apart accelerates, and vice
versa). As far as I could see, the vid-
eogame’s responded very well.
GestureTek has also collaborated
with Hitachi and 3D sensor maker,
Canesta, to create a gesture-con-
trolled TV. A lazy man’s dream? Driving game sans steering wheel
Mindflex – a mind control game
Computers
This year’s CES saw the birth of
Sony’s first Intel Atom powered
laptop, but the Japanese company
insists the P Series is not a netbook.
Sony’s Vice President, Mike Abary,
was quoted saying the P Series is
targeted at the premium market,
of which the “customer probably
doesn’t even know what a netbook
is”. Frankly, we think this is just an
excuse to justify the £849-or-higher
pricetag. Nevertheless, the “laptop”
felt good on hand, especially with
the generously-sized keyboard, but
you’re stuck with a nipple instead
of a trackpad sadly. The small high-
resolution screen (8”, 1600x768) is
great for moies on the go, yet the
device is crippled by a shabby 2hr
45min battery life.

the ASUS Eee PC T101H prototype
(pictured top, right hand column) –
the first Eee-branded tablet PC. No
prices yet (should be fairly afford-
able anyway), but it should be out
within the next few months.

Eee D200 (pictured right middle) –
a 2TB media server with a small
touchscreen, a slot-loading DVD
burner and 802.11n router (yes, a
built-in router!). It’s rumoured to
be priced at a mere $600, and will
come out in Q1 this year.
A quick browse around MSI’s
booth found a MacBook-Air-look-
alike X320 (pictured bottom right).
Weighing just 1.3kg with a 4-cell
battery (60g lighter than Air!),
sporting two USB ports instead of
one, and coming in three colour
options (black, silver and white).
The X320 might do slightly better
than the Air. We shall see.

Even though I’m not British, it was
still nice to bump into a few Brits in
Las Vegas.
Hailing from Cambridge was the
renowned Bluetooth company CSR
(Cambridge Silicon Radio), which
launched the TrueWireless Stereo
software development kit for high-
end Bluetooth stereo headphones
and speakers. The idea is that un-
like traditional Bluetooth speak-
ers, products developed using this
SDK do not require a hardwire-link
between the left speaker and right
speaker. To make this possible, one
of the speakers acts as the master,
which buffers the data stream from
the audio source, and then relays
the appropriate data to the slave
speaker. The developed products
will work with any existing A2DP
(Advanced Audio Distribution
Profile, for streaming high quality
stereo audio) devices. CSR’s TrueWireless Stereo SDK kills another wire
If you’ve been at Imperial long
enough then you might recognise
this guy on the left: Mr. Haider Bah-
rani was an M.Sc. student with the
Control & Power Research Group
in the EEE department, and before
that he studied electronic engineer-
ingatKingstonUniversity,wherehe
met his close friend and later busi-
ness partner, Remo Casadei. After
finishing his M.Sc. in 1994, Haider
joined Remo to launch Sonneteer
and their first product shown at
CES – the Campion amplifier –
was actually Haider’s improved fi-
nal year project from Kingston!
At the showroom, Haider proud-
ly showed me the freshly-launched
Morpheus – a slick, hand-made
£2200 high-end music centre that
plays “music from all your home
computers, the Internet, memory
sticks and your mobile phone” and
many more. Really impressive!

Last but not least: you may recall in
my Stuff Live coverage last term, I
mentioned the much-hyped portable
DJ device, the Pacemaker by Tonium
of Sweden. Well, on Day 0 of CES I
caught sight of fellow Brit DJ Tristan
da Cunha (left), who demonstrated the
Pacemaker for me at Stuff Live, and
then we bumped into each other again
on the train after the London show. I
didn’t manage to catch him then, but as
I was out night-sightseeing on Day 2, I
bumped into Tristan outside a casino!
What a small, small world.
Anyway, it turned out Tristan was the
lone Brit in the Swedish group – that’s
how good of a DJ he is! I then went to
his booth on Day 4 to check out Pace-
maker’s software update, and boy I was
pleased: the UI “has been completely
reworked” for user-friendliness, and
it now has auto beat match – a crucial
feature that was greatly missed in the
first generation software. When the
60GB version comes out in Spring for
£300, I might actually have to get one.

The ugly stuff...
More cool stuff...
WowWee Joebot can beatbox! Fujitsu PalmSecure system
I take back all my comments re-
garding how silly it is to keep ro-
botic pets. WowWee’s Joebot has
convinced me that I should get one:
not only can you fight it with any IR
remotes, but the comic robot can
also beatbox and dance! I’m sold!
As for the PalmSecure, this authen-
tication system reads your palm
vein pattern, requiring no physical
contact, making it an ideal system
for hospital security. The actual
sensor is only slightly bigger than
the average water bottle cap.
I had a proper “WTF” moment
when I saw these head-swinging
(and no doubt head-shaking for us)
iPod speakers.
More hilarious still was that sat at
the top of the animal kingdom was
“Happy Obama” (congratulations,
by the way). Search for “OZAKI
Obama” on YouTube for some “Yes
we can!” action.
