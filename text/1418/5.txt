F
irst off I need to thank
A.Geek for inspiring me to
find a writer’s name. I can be
horridly uninventive at times
but thanks to him I shall no
longer have to write as merely Un-
known. I must say I found the reply to
my last article quite funny, even though
I was just a tad upset that things didn’t
seem to come across as I wanted them
to, ah well! I have a reiteration of the
same sort of idea written already but
I’m not going to bore people with the
same concept so soon… perhaps I’ll
send that one in sometime next term.
So now allow me to get on with the
topic I want to address today. I really
should have commented on this last
week, but my lethargic nature and
my uncanny trend to procrastinate
delayed the effort of typing these few
words slightly.
As I’m sure you’re all aware there are
at least two different forms of criti-
cism; constructive and destructive. I’m
also sure I don’t have to explain how
A.Geek’s rant on Imperial Girl two
weeks ago was definitely the latter. Now
that in itself is no problem, freedom of
speech comes with freedom of expres-
sion, and if you put your opinions and
views out there you have to be ready to
see them torn apart, trampled on, spat
at and pulled through the mud.
However, while there is no doubt that
such is acceptable, I wonder if it is nec-
essary in many cases. What happened
with Imperial Girl went beyond criti-
cism into mobbing and, for reasons I
will explore later, even into bullying
in my opinion and resulted in nothing
more than some cheap laughs, the loss
of diversity of views in our newspaper,
a surely insulted and hurt author and
the intimidation for other people to
share their more intimate views out of
fear of having them similarly ripped to
shreds.
Now I happen to be a fan of A.Geek
usually, he has a very witty way of writ-
ing and his articles can be quite amus-
ing just as Gilead’s elegant mastery of
English can be delightful to read even
though he lacks content at times. Also
I disagree with a lot, if not most of, the
ideas in Imperial Girl’s articles but that
does not change the fact that regard-
less of my opinion, hers are just as
valid. Even though I do not agree with
her, I find it interesting to see how she
thinks. It brings diversity, a variety of
outlooks on life and alone the fact that
her view on life is so radically different
to mine or what I usually read, alone
the fact that I’m left wondering how
she got to the conclusions she did, it
makes her articles well worth reading.
But as popular as A.Geek maybe, he
is absolutely no one to say who “has is-
sues” and who has not. When someone
commits themselves to writing about
one’s own feelings and thoughts like
IG did, it’s more than words that go
into the article. As soon as you write
about how you truly feel or think,
you’ve opened yourself up and there,
in between the jokes, fluff and prose, is
a certain part of you in that article. To
then have your views so aggressively
assaulted from several fronts at once
with nothing held back, I can imagine
hurts.
When I saw the various reactions
to IG tabloid take its course I was re-
minded of a scenario back in time
that I would imagine at least a few of
the students here will find familiar.
Perhaps some of you remember that
“cool” / “popular”/ “funny” guy in early
Secondary. Perhaps some of you re-
call the quieter “geek” who unlike his
peers didn’t think physics and maths
was all that bad. Nor did he think that
the black guy rapping off on how many
niggas he killed or how many bitches
he fucked was all that awesome.
Perhaps you recall how because he
thought differently to the rest and
didn’t follow the mainstream he was al-
ways the butt of jokes and never really
fit in. Whenever he said something the
“popular guy” would mock it and the
crowd would all laugh amusedly and
slowly but surely the “geek” would stop
bothering to give his input. A classic
story of the creation of an outsider.
But then again perhaps you have
forgotten or never saw such a thing.
Fortunately the story has a happy end,
because the “geek” goes off to a good
university with likeminded people.
He even goes as far as writing to the
newspaper regularly and in his own
way becomes quite popular amongst
his peers. He can proudly be who he is
and express himself and all seems well.
Oh the irony is thus; that when in
his new environment emerges a per-
son who seems to think differently to
him and the rest he resorts to mocking
and attacking this. Backed by the many
who think alike, he works on making
that person who is different look stu-
Suicidal-emo-girl? on tolerance, criticism, Imperial Girl and A. Geek
“As soon as you
write about how
you truly feel
you’ve opened
yourself up
and there, in
between jokes,
fluff and prose, is
a part of you in
that article”
pid and labels their views as ridiculous
and pathetic until just as so many years
earlier that person ceases to express
themselves the way they did.
That isn’t criticism, it’s no different
to the bullying one would expect of
immature kids. It may be more refined,
more intellectual and justifiable by free
speech, but for anyone who gives it
some thought it is still no more than
bullying.
I would like to encourage IG to return
to the newspaper, for if the authors in
my felix should have to be limited to
those whose articles appeal to the likes
of A.Geek or alternatively those tough
enough to take no heed of the aggres-
sive feedback it will surely be a empty
newspaper. Funny, amusing perhaps,
but empty. I don’t need someone to
write stuff the way I see things for its
nothing new, I’m much more interest-
ed to hear those who think differently.
To conclude, in his last article
A.Geek speaks of freeing little felix
from his ball gag, and I could not agree
with him more. But censorship does
not only come in the form of outright
prohibition to print something but can
also be generated more subtly by creat-
ing such an aggressive critical atmos-
phere that authors are intimidated to
write as they want to in fear of being
utterly flamed and bashed. In general
a bit more tolerance could do people a
whole lot of good.
But otherwise I still think you’re a
pretty cool guy A.Geek. Comment
over. Enjoy your week everybody!

Guardian Weekly - Podcast of the
Week
As a long-
time
Guard-
ian reader
(‘leftie-
scum’
to my
friends) I
was a rela-
tive late-
comer to
their science podcast. Presented by
one of the best teams of science jour-
nalists around – at least in Britain,
where the paucity of good science re-
porting is worrying – Guardian Week-
ly is consistently thought-provoking,
witty, and, most important of all, in-
formative. It comes out every week (if
you hadn’t guessed), along with the
occasional special edition, and usually
runs to around 40 minutes.
Recent podcasts have focused on,
amongst other things, Barack Obama’s
views on science, space tourism, im-
provisation, and Darwin’s beard. In-
trigued? If so, give the show a listen:
you (hopefully) won’t be disappointed.
Much easier than picking up the news-
paper, with added interviews – nota-
ble scientific celebrities include Sir
Martin Rees, Marcus du Sautoy, and
Imperial’s own Sir John ‘Mr. Invis-
ible’ Pendry – plus special features
and top-notch analysis from Alok Jha
and his crack team of writers. And you
can listen while doing the washing up,
something which I don’t recommend
trying with the paper.

Felix Whitton reviews newspaper ‘casts
It seems like an inevitable consequence
of having things to do- we’re going to
have to spend time pondering, avoid-
ing, being distracted from the task in
hand. But researchers studying pro-
crastination think it can have serious
health and financial consequences,
and are looking for ways to conquer
time-wasting, potentially rendering
Facebook useless.
Around 90% of university students
are time-wasters, according to Uni-
versity of Calgary economist Piers
Steel, who describes procrastination
as ‘voluntarily delaying a course of ac-
tion despite expecting to be worse off
for the delay’.
It comes from a human urge to
avoid the unpleasant. Students are a
high risk category due to their often
hectic academic schedules and social

NY Times: Science Times
The NYT is
a journalis-
tic heavy-
weight,
and as such
you would
expect a
bruiser of
a podcast
to go with
such a reputation. But this is America,
lest we forget, so any science must be
delivered in an earnestly folksy style,
at the same time both patronising and
yawn inducingly dull. So we have a
short snappy news bit; a quirky (read:
irritating) ‘health quiz’, which makes
one wait until the end of the podcast
to discover the answer (as if we care!);
the ‘science minute’ section (how very
New York); and gravel-voiced present-
er and science editor David Corcoran
introducing guests and features. There
are positives, the podcast manages to
squeeze a lot into less than 20 minutes.
And they do look at ‘serious’ science
– amid the bombardment of health
gossip – such as last week’s special ‘Be-
yond the gene’, which was illuminating,
if annoying for me – as a biologist and
pedant – when the panel of journalists
fell into the trap of talking about ‘a gene
for so-and-so’. There is also a global feel
to the podcast, a nice change for any-
one who has had to sit through hours
of inward-looking US shows. So while
things are patchy stylistically, Science
Times partly atones for its sins by tak-
ing a serious, if at times humourless,
look at the world of science beyond the
parochial borders of middle-America.

lives. Studies have shown that chronic
procrastinators have raised stress lev-
els, and are prone to further risks to
their health by putting off trips to the
doctor and the dentist. They are much
more likely to have accidents in the
home as they will avoid ‘dull’ tasks like
changing a lightbulb.
Procrastination at work has finan-
cial consequences as time spent star-
ing out of the window could be time
spent productively badgering away.
Steel believes certain character traits
bring out the inner procrastinator,
leaving some more prone. Time wast-
ers are low in the conscientious trait,
they are less ‘dutiful, organised and
industrious’.
They are also likely to be impulsive-
mixing up their intentions so being
easily distracted. Anxiety can be im-
plicit- a fear of failure can lead some-
one to put off starting a task.
If this sounds like you, or you’ve no-
Maxwell J. Axiom is no ordinary super-
hero. He is no other than the super sci-
entist! If you had any doubt about sci-
ence being super, he’s here to quench
that doubt. Born to a marine biologist
mother and nuclear physicist/park
ranger father in Seattle, USA, he’s got
black skin, brown eyes and no hair. He
is the scientific version of Shaft, swift,
dynamic, cool. His super-powers come
from a lightning that struck him one
day on a wilderness hike: it gave him a
newfound energy and motivated him
to travel the globe and earn degrees
in every aspect of science. Equipped
with this enormous knowledge that he
was ready to share, he assumed a new
identity: Max Axiom, Super Scientist.
His superpowers include super-intelli-
gence, ability to shrink to a size of an
atom, time travel and X-ray vision. So
apart from breaking a few laws of phys-
ics in the start there, he does make up
for it by using all of his powers to ex-
plain the science to the readers.
Earthquakes
Max is in danger at the beginning
of this comic, as his car is stuck on a
collapsing bridge. He gets saved by a
rescue helicopter and flying becomes
his mode of transport. By the end he
gets to fly in a helicopter, personal au-
tomatic hand glider and a private jet.
In addition he rides a sleek motorbike
and scuba dives. No wonder, when he
gets to visit the top of the Mount Ev-
erest, dive off the coast of Alaska back
in 1964, fly over San Andreas fault in
California and then go to Taiwan, and
also visit Iran after the devastating
2003 earthquake and all this in just 23
pages.
Volcanoes
In another one of episodes packed with
time and space travel, Max starts of on
the slopes of a volcano in Costa Rica
dressed in some high-tech volcanolo-
gist suit; then he flies to a research ves-
sel somewhere on the Pacific to take
a ‘mini-sub’ to the seabed to show us
underwater volcanoes forming new
islands. He travels back in time to see
the eruptions and the after-effects in
Washington in 1980, Martinique in
1902 and Pompeii in AD 79, so apart
from some learning about the tectonic
plates, volcanoes and the composi-
tion of the Earth, we also get a bit of
history.
Magnetism
This is the famous episode where
Max “shrinks to the size of an atom”
in order to explain just how magnet-
ism works at an atomic level. He also
visits ancient Greece where the word
magnet was first coined, it was named
after a region called Magnesia which
was littered with a naturally magnetic
rock “magnesian stone”. Another story
says magnets were first discovered
by a Greek shepherd Magnes whose
sandals (built with iron nails) were at-
tracted to magnesian stones. Not even
Max can tell us if this story is true, but
he sure makes sure we understand how
and why magnets work in this fascinat-
ing comic.
Scientific Method
What is so special about science; why
do we often put it before other kinds
of knowledge? Some would argue it is
the scientific method that gives sci-
ence its prestige and claim to objectiv-
ity. But in order to decide if this is true
or not one needs to understand what
this method is. Perhaps more impor-
tantly for would-be scientists is to see
how the scientists go about their daily
work: what is it that they do when they
practice science? Philosophers and
sociologists have argued for decades
about this, but Max explains the crux
of it in this exciting episode that sees
Max’s city threatened by flooding from
a nearby river. The best way to decide
on how to stop the river is to follow
the scientific method to design the
best possible levee to prevent the river
from overflowing. Forming hypotheses
and testing them, making scaled down
ticed a stressed out friend with bad
teeth and anecdotes of falling over
in darkened rooms, help is at hand.
One strategy which has been shown
to work is to set yourself attainable,
specific goals, instead of a vague goal
which allows a get-out clause. So re-
place ‘I will get fit’ with ‘I’m going to
the gym tomorrow at 7.30am.’
Psychologist Tim Pychyl gives some
nice parent-style advice: “Just get
started”, the anticipation will be much
worse than the actual task. To prove
his credentials, he carried out a survey
on his students, querying their moods
and how much they were putting off
tasks with deadlines.
He found ‘when students actually
do the task they are avoiding, their
perceptions of the task change signifi-
cantly. Many times, they actually en-
joyed it.’

Light
Sunshine, sun-bathing, rainbows and
lightning are all the phenomena Max
attempts to explain in this episode.
Just to make sure we understand it
all he embarks on space voyage in his
compact space-shuttle, all the way to
the Sun to observe nuclear fusion that
creates energy some of which is visible
light. He also rides a beam of light at
the maximum possible speed in the
universe, and obviously has a lot of fun
doing it! But we see here that Max is
also a human being, he visits a muse-
um, has a cookie and a hot drink and
relaxes watching telly when his work is
done.
It’s rumoured that Max can even ‘down’ a yard of ale in 3.32 seconds
