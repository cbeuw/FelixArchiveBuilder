DeIViants Maintain Unbeaten Away Record
Qualifying 4th at the regionals, nar-
rowly missing a spot in Division 1,
Imperials Ultimate Frisbee team, the
discDoctors (dD), headed to Manches-
ter for the University Indoor Nationals
Division 2.
The team: Pyro (C), Finnish, Rosie,
Ed, Magnet, Mythago Jon and Tow.
After five gruelling hours on the
coach, we arrived in Manchester
and headed to meet our host for the
weekend.
SATURDAY
Our venue was the Manchester Ve-
lodrome, an awesome location with a
central area for pitches surrounded by
the cycling track.
vs Random Fling (Nottingham): 5-8
dD started sluggishly and fell behind.
We traded points towards the end, but
discDoctors head north for Nationals
couldn’t pull ourselves back from the
early deficit.
vs Cobras (Chichester): 11-3
It was disappointing to travel so far
to play Chichester, another South-East
team, especially after having played
them at every tournament so far this
year. They’d looked weak at regionals,
and with a depleted team looked even
moreso in Manchester. dD won com-
fortably without any hitches.
vs Fish (Lancaster): 10-5
We weren’t sure what to expect hav-
ing never played Fish before. They
were top of the pool, so we expected
a tough match. We knew that if we
won, we would overtake them, so we
started strong and maintained our
lead throughout. We used our zone-D
to great effect, forcing turnovers and
outmatching them on O. We were now
guaranteed a top 8 finish.
vs BUF (Oxford Brookes): 6-5
Winning this match meant a guar-
anteed top 4 finish. Last year BUF
beat us soundly and went on to win
the tournament, so we expected a
gruelling contest. We were really up
for this game, and while everyone got
psyched, I resorted to getting high on
random energy gel. dD took a 4-1 lead
through some massive grabs and sexy
offense against their zone-D, but they
dug deep and caught up, but for every
hard-fought point they scored, we re-
sponded quickly and we finished 1
point ahead.
SATURDAY NIGHT
We planned to go for dinner followed
by SingStar at one of the hosts’ houses
before the traditional Saturday night
party. However, “we weren’t allowed
to”, as the host who had SingStar was
host to BUF. It seemed they harboured
some resentment and were adamant
about not wanting to hang out with
dD.
We headed to a nearby pub for food
and some chilling, and then headed to
techno-club Baa-Bar. Finnish imme-
diately took to wooing the ladies with
his trademark dance moves, but erred
when he attempted a dance-off with a
breakdancer. Despite Finnish’s usual
tractor-like pull with the ladies, Pyro
wasn’t about to let that happen in his
backyard (the north) and swept our
host off her feet. As always, dD were
the ‘ultimate’ party animals, and par-
tied till closing. Aside from a couple
Bath players, all the other teams had
gone home.
SUNDAY
We were fortunate to start at noon;
necessary to sleep off the alcohol from
the night before. Also, to sleep off some
late-night terrorizing from Chiches-
ter, who’d stayed in the same house,
which included the licking of sleeping
Mythago Jon’s face and the stacking
of clothes, pots and pans on top of a
sleeping Rosie.
vs Dark Horses (Strathclyde): 5-11
Horses were the eventual tourna-
ment winners, so there was no shame
in losing. I think we were feeling the
aftermath of the night before, and
some wobbly throws and shaky hands
saw Horses quickly take the lead. The
match was much tighter than the score
indicates, but ultimately, they were
the better team. They broke down our
zone-D, and some clinical offense and
tight D saw them leading throughout.
vs DUF (Durham): 5-4
Our final match for a podium fin-
ish (3rd vs. 4th). We were all up for
this one and it showed. We fell behind
0-2 but pulled together, showed some
heart and fought back. I recall some of
the biggest grabs of the weekend, and
some of the hardest man-D I’ve seen,
and played, in ages. This game went to
the wire; a perfect way to end an epic
tournament.
And so dD finished 3rd at Nationals
Division 2. For consecutive years, we
were the only South-East team to fin-
ish in the top half.
Magnet was MVP for his solid O &
D, and ridiculous aerial superiority.
That being said, everyone else played
incredibly too. We played our hardest,
and most importantly, as a team. We
were spirited and intense, exactly how
a university team should be. We did so
well and we can all be proud of how we
played.
Outdoor regionals are fast-approach-
ing, so watch this space…
With goalkeeper Cotton-Eye-Joe un-
available due to a viva (quite important
apparently) what were the DeIViants
to do? No magic stick, no pink slipper
– not good. Dirty Sheets deputised in
goal - the name didn’t bode well but
those in-the-know knew otherwise.
Captain Mr Pacman tried to make
things worse by producing directions
to a pitch in Surbiton, which ended on
a road in Clapham. Nonetheless the
DeIViants made it there, early: things
were looking up!
The DeIViants controlled the first
half thanks in great part to Fourplay,
Mr Pacman and Santa’s Little Helper’s
dominance in central midfield. After
ten minutes a slick interplay in at-
tack between Tracy and Quickie led
Hockey
Imperial Men’s 4th XI 4
St George’s Men’s 2nd XI 0
Featherlite
to Quickie’s shot being saved only for
Freedom Pass to steam in and tuck
away the rebound for his first DeIViant
goal: 1-0. IC kept piling on the pressure
with Premature Withdrawal and Free
Willy stretching the George’s defence
with searching runs down the wings.
Tracy hit his first of three posts with
an ambitious reverse-stick shot. De-
fensively the DeIViants looked solid.
Easy Access, Stubble Rash and Oedi-
pus were marking the George’s attack
out of the game leaving Featherlite free
to roam and bawl his head off. George’s
only real chance came when Oedipus
forgot which direction he was playing
and put their striker clean through.
The crisis was averted by an excellent
sliding save by Dirty Sheets and Feath-
erlite frantically clearing the follow-up.
Order was restored soon after when
Tracy contrived not to hit the post and
put the DeIViants 2-0 up at half time.
George’s came out fired up for the
second half. Mr Pacman calmly slot-
ting home a short corner two minutes
in to make it 3-0 but IC were still un-
der the cosh and soaking up George’s
pressure.
Curb Crawler and Sticky Situation
were both frustrating the George’s at-
tack with some excellent interventions
and Oedipus, now seemingly happy
with the direction we were playing,
was a central defensive wall. Excellent
controlling central midfield play from
Fourplay, Mr Pacman and Quickie, as
well as some impressive growling from
Santa’s Little Helper and some frankly
wild diving from Freedom Pass, turned
the tables and the final quarter of the
game was all IC.
Random Fresher no. 6 created some
good chances and came close, Tracy
continued to try to break the goal
frame and Quickie was a whisker away
from a well-worked short corner.
Finally, Mr Pacman made it 4-0 and
put the game beyond doubt with an-
other almost lackadaisical but accurate
short corner. At the final whistle, the
DeIViants maintained their unbeat-
en record on the road and soon after
learnt Cotton-Eye-Joe was now Dr
Cotton-Eye-Joe to round off an excel-
lent afternoon.
