Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition -8
T
erm is almost over. A good
thing for some, it gives you
time to catch up on hours
of missed work. However
many seem to underes-
timate the down side. The Christmas
break is very lonely. Sure you can go
home and see you family and friends,
but what about all those good times
you spent with your friends here at
university? You’ll miss all those times
you could just walk into the UNION
and drink yourself silly, while being
with people who actually understand
you, and what your about. No your not
emo, but you are a geek. We all are,
and there is no use denying it. Chances
are, while the company you keep back
home are extremely fun and enjoyable
to be around, they won’t adhere to the
elitist views your time at Imperial Col-
lege has given you. Think about it. Next
time you out with your school mates
you’ll have a thought at some point
that roughly goes like this. “Back at uni
we’d be doing *blank* right now.”
This may seem and awful thing to
think, but this merely means you miss
10. Ravi Pall:
Don’t be coy, I know you secretly
adore the felix editor with the longest
hair. How could you not?
He has everything you could possi-
bly want in a mate/boyfriend/casual
acquaintance: a live now (die a hor-
rible death later) approach to life and
an unhealthy disregard for sport,
work and his survival in general.
Of course none of this matters, as a
re-app he’s built an impressive army
of freshers who will come in very
useful when Ravi’s organs finally fail
from continuous, intense alcohol
abuse. (This is all total bollocks- Ed)
Coffee Break

This week’s winner. Team Shotgun! Next week’s RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulations to this week’s win-
ner, Team Shotgun I’m loving the
Chistmas theme here guys. Sure it’s
an over rated holiday, but beards and
mats make everything better. Also I
do believe Jovan with his smoke pipe
has caused a LOLOCAUST!.
Keep up the good work, and please en-
ter next week. It’s good to see more en-
tires in this week, especially after last
week’s epic fail.
Drink with me, I’m Snaky B
and this week I’m dressed as Bruce Lee
The high res picture can be found on-
line. Click on Coffee Break in the sec-
tions tab. Email your entry to coffee.
felix@imperial.ac.uk with your team
name and .PSD file and you’ll be en-
tered into the FUCWIT league.
This week’s image is of Alex McKee
and Medic president Mark Chamber-
lain sitting in the office of our beloved
DPEW. What are they doing though?
Also what is up with the look Mark is
giving Alex?

uni life, and why wouldn’t you? You can
do whatever you feel like, when you
like. No parents nagging you to do this,
not erroneous family members visiting
with complete ignorance to your intel-
ligence. Happy days.
For those of you who are staying in
London this holiday. Well done. You’ve
become an independent person who
will carry on doing whatever they
like (that or you can’t gather the dol-
lar to get the train/bus/plane home).
Look forward to things like the Winter
Wonderland in Hyde Park, or the New
Year fireworks at the London Eye. Sure
you won’t get any presents, but you’re
probably not religious anyway, or if you
are, unlucky. I say unlucky, more like
grow up. You’re over 18 and know San-
ta doesn’t exist. If you really want the
presents and food get it mailed to you.
That’s right I just suggested mailing
food. It’s my idea and I’ll make millions
(or not). In conclusion to this rant, I
would just like to say that Christmas
is too much of a commercial holiday
to get wrapped up in, so don’t worry
about it.
Christmas is
over rated
I am Snaky B. I am Bruce Lee. I am
the dragon. I am the warrior. I am the
killing machine. Seriously though,
wait until I roundhouse kick you liver
into next week. Not just that, but your
kidneys too. Ha ha ha ha. Joking...
Not! POW!
Now I have your attention with my
sweet ass moves I would like to make
an important message. The real cause
of my death was due to the excess in-
take of alcohol. Alcohol, while fun to
consume responsibly, can have detri-
mental effects on your body, especially
when used long term. If you think you
may be an alcoholic, or consume more
than you should, go and see a doctor.
They will me more than happy to put
you right back on track.
Now where was I? Oh yeah. Did you
see that movie I was in one time. I was
awesome. I kicked so many people in the
teeth it was bad ass. Some say I could
win in a fight against Jackie Chan and
Jet lee. I believe these people. I know
I’m a corpse and wot not, but zombies
kick ass. So being a martial genius and a
zombie is mega kick ass.
That’s it for this term guys, that was
the last time Snaky be will be dressing
up, but come back next week where we
review all my previous costumes.
