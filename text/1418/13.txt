Artificial Intelligence
Joseph Letts wonders if it an essential tool for students?
I
'm sorry to seize you in with such
an irrelevant title! It took me a
while to work out what my first
(possible) article for felix would
be, and after some wild guesses I
went with Artificial Intelligence. We all
see robots in the movies, and comput-
ers which can take over the world (in-
sert: Arnie and Skynet) and although it
is not at the front of everybody’s mind,
sooner or later on an empty day, you
start wondering, what would it be like if
computers could think for themselves?
So, the first question is: what defines
artificial intelligence? When we think
about artificial intelligence in terms of
its popular culture reference, we tend
to think that it revolves around the idea
of machines which act self-dependent-
ly from humans, capable of premedi-
tated murder (think iRobot), and with
general megalomaniac tendencies (e.g.
the Matrix). A useful scientific defini-
tion I have found states:
Artificial intelligence is the study of
the computations that make it possible
to perceive reason and act.
Extract from: Chapter 1, Artificial
Intelligence by Patrick Henry Winston
(3rd Edition).
But what does that mean when it ís
at home? Essentially, it means that ar-
tificial intelligence describes the field
of study which enables technology to
react and carry out decisions based
on inputs from its environment. Dur-
ing my web research about AI, Iíve
realised that it covers a much broader
topic than I anticipated, branching off
into different sections. Some forms
of AI are already being implemented,
examples being route finding sys-
tems for complex transport networks,
handwriting recognition software and
speech synthesizers. These systems
are capable of learning and making
decisions, e.g. text-to-speech systems
which study patterns in language to
improve their chance of synthesising
words, or handwriting recognition sys-
tems which can adapt themselves to a
user’s handwriting to reduce the prob-
ability of mistranslation.
However, there are some problem
areas of AI which still cause trouble to
our scientists in the present day. One
of these is the problem of perception,
which would enable a machine to de-
termine its place in its current envi-
ronment and plan a suitable route for
navigation to certain areas or for es-
cape. The ultimate application of this
would be the futuristic motorways in
movies, where cars drive on auto-pilot
(how ironic) at high speeds without
any trouble at all.
While some parts of this problem
have been simplified, one of the main
stumbling blocks involves the way in
which machines view the environment.
As humans, we naturally see the world
in terms of distances, and objects
(with which we can
interact) because
our brains do all
the work for
us. In com-
parison
ma-
chine processors only receive what
they see by analysing data received
from visual inputs (i.e. cameras). The
machines then have to calculate the
perceived location of objects in their
vision (easier with two cameras than
with one) as well as classify these
objects.
Humans have an easy job of clas-
sifying families of objects; it has been
hard for researchers to quantify the
process involved, and so making
it harder to simulate the process
on machines, leading to large
databases of images, stored
for the sole purpose of object
recognition.
An interesting advance seen in
Artificial Intelligence which is close
to home is the Painting Fool. A project
started by Dr. Simon Colton (Doc) in
2001, the painting fool is an AI pro-
gram which makes artist’s impression
of pictures of people and landscapes.
The program has recently been en-
hanced with help from Michel Valstar
(DoC PhD 2008) and Dr. Maja Pantic
(DoC), who provided another AI com-
puter vision program which uses a
video feed to detect the emotion on a
subject’s face. This information is then
fed to the painting fool, which uses the
input to paint an abstract portrait, us-
ing different colours and perspectives
for each emotion.
The next goal of the painting
fool is to become creative,
i.e. become able to paint
new pictures without
an input.
This brings for-
ward the topic
of machine
conscious-
ness. The
examples
that I’ve dis-
cussed so
far all con-
cern systems
which are
used for indi-
vidual purpos-
es, generally
to aid humans
achieve their
goals. However,
the most interest-
ing part of AI con-
cerns computers which
think by themselves and
create their own goals.
These machines are said
to show true artificial in-
telligence, which resembles
the intelligence of hu-
mans. These machines
would show capabili-
ties including problem
solving, rationality
and learning.
Another
area in which they may have talent in is
in creativity. If computers could be de-
veloped possessing such abilities, the
future could be a different place. Such
an event might lead to computers be-
ing considered conscious and possibly
even living beings.
A future where computers are alive
and participating members of society
is an idea that strikes fear into the
hearts of many. But would
it be such a bad thing?
With ro-
bots and computing systems
that advanced, the productive poten-
tial of the world would increase by a
great magnitude. With robot workers
being tireless and able to work for long
periods without rest and without pay,
production would become more ef-
ficient, leading to cheaper prices for
consumers as a wider stock of goods
to choose from. Also, if robots were
chosen for menial and dangerous jobs
(such as cleaning or quarrying), peo-
ple who would have worked in poor
conditions or little pay would be free
to search for more
rewarding and
fulfilling
careers.
Not to
men-
tion
that
fewer mistakes would be made, leading
to a safer world and less train delays.
On the other hand, would the fu-
ture be as rosy as some paint it? What
would happen if they replaced humans
in all jobs? We might lose all of our
specialised craft skills (e.g. masonry,
thatching), our music and our art,
fundamental parts of human culture.
It would be interesting to see how we
would function as a society, if people
have no careers in the future would
there be a communist economy, with
no difference in wealth and circum-
stances? Would society be happy that
way, or will there always be people who
strive to differentiate themselves from
the masses. Would people even bother
to provide an education for their chil-
dren, if machines could do everything
anyway?
If that happened, a disaster may oc-
cur if the machines broke down and
could not be fixed by other ma-
chines. It could even lead to a dark
age, with humans having to learn from
scratch. Or has this already
happened?
An even
more
wor-
rying
problem might occur if the comput-
ers of the future develop emotions and
personalities. Would they be content
to do all that we ask them? If these
computers will be able to create their
own goals and solve problems, would
there be a stage where they decide that
their goal differs from the general goal
of humanity, which is to advance our-
selves in terms of knowledge, creativity
and society? What would happen if this
new goal required the disappearance
of humans? Would we be able to fight
of this new enemy, who aim to destroy
us using our weapons and unbeatable
strategies?
Many academics are split of the like-
lihood of a machine conscious, an ar-
gument which has spanned over many
decades. It can be simplified into an
argument between two sides, between
dualists and materialists.
The dualist philosophy is a belief that
thought and conscience are products
of a nonphysical substance, while the
materialist philosophy holds the belief
that all mental actions can be explained
by interactions between physical mat-
ter (i.e. chemicals). Dualists argue that
as long as intelligence is established
by a nonphysical substance, man can-
not create artificial intelligence in ma-
chines in any manner. Materialists op-
pose this by saying that is the mind is
made of purely physical matter, then it
is possible to create an artificial intel-
ligence in machines that approximates
human intelligence.
But how do we know when a ma-
chine has reached a suitable level of
cognisance to be seen as truly intelli-
gent? Well, there have been a few tests
proposed to answer this question, the
most notable being a test devised by
the father of modern computer sci-
ence, Alan Turing. The Turing test
determines a computer to be intelli-
gent if a human judge cannot between
a computer and a human in separate
one-on-one conversations. Both con-
versations would be carried out in text,
to make each participant anonymous.
But this is a theoretical test which has
its criticisms.
At the end of the day, we can only
speculate about the contents of the fu-
ture as (thankfully) we haven ít quite
reached a stage where these things are
possible yet. Our computers are only as
good as the code that instructs them.
Or are theyÖ01010?
