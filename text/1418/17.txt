Hi Colette, thank you very much
for meeting felix sports today!
First things first - how has your
season been so far?
The season for the first team has not
been too great so far because we have
yet to win a game. But we are making
progress.
Progress in which particular areas
exactly?
Our team is improving game upon
game! I am spanking them [the girls]
regularly to make them play better! Se-
riously we are training hard though!
Have you played the Medics yet
this season?
We actually played them [in ULU]
last night, and that wasn’t a great game
for us at all, I am ashamed to say. I am
not really sure what the score was... 30
something 5? [Final score was 28-8].
When the 1sts do finally win their
first game of the season we will all be
doing the felix page 3!
Bearing in mind that you are yet
to win a game, how do you fancy
your chances against the Medics
this year in Varsity?
Well Varsity is a very different game
and just because we have not won yet,
it doesn’t mean we are not going to be
any less prepared. I know the girls are
going to try really hard [pause] and
win!
I understand you are the club cap-
tain of the netball club, as well
as being a prominent 1st team
player. How do you think the rest
of the club is doing?
The rest of the club is doing really
well this year. The 2nd team are un-
defeated apart from one game, but
we won’t talk about that as we are not
happy. We are hoping that they will get
promoted in both the BUCS and ULU
leagues this year. I am very proud of the
3rd team because it is their first year in
BUCS this season and they have been
winning games even though they are
in the same league as the 2nd team. So
they are doing really well. Both Anna
and Alice are doing really a great job in
their captaincy roles.
So moving on from netball to
other sports - who is doing well?
Who is not?
Well I know the rugby 1st XV are
struggling like we are, they are yet to
win a game. I know that the volleyball
girls are doing amazingly in the BUCS
Premiership even without their star
players from the IDEA league last year
in Zurich!
How do you think the Impe-
rial sports teams can survive in
higher leagues once they have
gain promotion.
I think it is very hard for those teams,
especially us, that have been promoted
when a lot of key players have gradu-
ated. It was obvious last year that the
league we were in was too easy for us
and we deserved to go up to a league
that would be more challenging. This
year we have lost players to injury and
illness hence an inconsistent team. We
also have many postgraduates playing
for us that find it very hard to get the
time off to play. I think in general that
the high work load at Imperial means
that people find it hard to put as much
time as they want to into sports.
How is the netball club supported
by both Sport Imperial and the
union?
Sport Imperial are very generous
with the amount of court time we get
for our BUCS fixtures. It is a shame we
cannot fit training in there as well.
Week 3 in the build up to 25th February 2009. This week, Jack
Cornish interviews the Imperial Netball club captain and 1st team
player Colette Gregory
Do you think sport at Imperial
suffers because we are based so
centrally in London?
To be honest the netball club doesn’t
suffer too badly because we can still
find courts centrally. Sometimes I wish
we had courts at Harlington with all
the other sports as we are bit left out
because of it. I am sure after years of
travelling to Harlington you would
wish you were in Ethos!
After the recent football shenani-
gans, what is your view on the
matter?
Well, no-one is more of a fan than
going out with your sports team than
me. On a Wednesday night teams
should be out but they have taken it
too far. I think unfortunately it is just
a few people giving the whole club and
the university a bad reputation.
One of the most important things
for the sportsmen/women is
the social side. How is it in the
netball club?
Umm, this year I have calmed down
a little on the social side, being a ma-
ture final year and all! Although I do
still maintain my record of not missing
a Wednesday night. I have not been
to Opal as much for the Daiquiris, or
downed as many pints of wine! The
netball club as a whole loves ACC
Bar Nights and we have several extra
events organised by our social sec in-
cluding pub golf and tour.
Do you think the union should
focus on participation in sports or
excellence?
They need to strike a balance.
Is it being struck?
The netball club strives to allow all
ranges of abilities to participate. You
could be in the competitive 1st team or
just turn up to training and come for
the social side and not play any games
at all.
Moving on to a more light heart-
ed subject, if you weren’t playing
netball what would you be doing
in your spare time?
Boys!
I was thinking more along the
lines of other sports?!
Oh, whoops! I think I would make
an excellent synchronised swimmer or
maybe shot-put!
Can you explain the nickname
‘Spanky-Pants’?
It is becoming a bit of a mini tradi-
Not only a pro-netballer she also takes her drinking
pretty seriously. Pints of wine, cocktails and a sneeky
snakey-b would just be a starter in the world of Ms.
Gregory. Her prominence in the Netball Club has
allowed the club to grow from strength to strength and
big ideas for the club are in the pipeline. Her continued
involvement in Union life has made her a trademark on
the court and in the bars.

Colette Gregory
tion for the net-
ball club to have
an Anne Sum-
mers party each
year. Last year af-
ter several glasses
of Rose wine I de-
cided to purchase
a rather interesting
set of lingerie! It al-
ways gets an interest-
ing response when I
take my clothes off!
Tell me a joke.
I could tell a geeky physics
one but...OK. Why are quantum
physicists so bad in bed?
Why?
Either they’ve found the
momentum but they can’t get
the position or they’ve got the
position but they can’t find the
momentum!
And finally, the stand-
ard question: what is
orienteering?
I know what orienteering is!
We did this in Zurich [at the
IDEAleague lastyear].Itiserm...
you get given a map with posts
that you have to try and find. I
also know that you shouldn’t wear
ballet pumps while doing it other-
wise you get really bad blisters!
Who would you say is your
sporting idol?
Neil Jenkins, utter legend. My
Dad used to take me to Car-
diff Arms Park to watch him
play. I have a grog of him and
everything.
Who do you honestly think
will win the Varsity rugby
match in February 2009?
IC all the way! They have been
working so hard and they deserve
it. Of course it will be close but it’s de-
ffo our time now.
How did the netball vs. rugby
charity match go this year?
Unfortunately, the match wasn’t as
successful as last year for various rea-
sons. However there is going to be an
even bigger and better event next term
to make up for it. I’m thinking a tour-
nament followed by a social. We can
get all the sports clubs to join in and
enter a team so that as much money as
possible is raised for charity.
How would you say the netball
club has changed and/or improved
since your time at IC?
The netball club has become a lot
more prominent on the social side of
things and we’ve got amazing pink
hoodies now.
In the unfortunate even of
you not winning a match
this year, will you still hon-
our the netball pledge to
grace the centrefold of felix?
If enough people want it then I might
be persuaded...
It is very hard
especially ... when
a lot of key players
have graduated.
We ran off the cold pitch last Wednes-
day in our muddy, well-worn boots
with rosy cheeks and an amazing
feeling of satisfaction having brought
home yet another victory. We retained
our position at the top of the league
with a 100% win rate from our first five
matches of the season. We started off
the year with our experienced players,
and have gained some fantastic new
freshers who have settled in well.
We first trekked it to Brighton but
the match was well worth the travel as
we played some fine lacrosse against a
competitive team to win 11-8.
Next on the line was a home match
at Harlington against King’s. This was
one of the most intense matches we
Lacrosse keep on winning
Elsa Butrous have ever played with some true fire
and grit coming form both teams. Af-
ter being down 3 goals at the ¾ inter-
val, we powered up and managed to
achieve 4 goals to win 7-6.
Portsmouth joined us in Harlington
for our next match and with some great
work in attack, we secured another win
and scored 18 goals against 3.
With a team of only 10, we travelled
to Kent University in Canterbury feel-
ing rather apprehensive about playing
2 ‘men’ down. Playing on some rather
long grass meant our lacrosse was
somewhat sluggish at times but we still
got the ball in the back of the net and
played some excellent defensive work
to come away with a 21-1 victory.
Most recently, we played King’s in
Berrylands. Having won by only one
goal in our first encounter with them,
everyone was psyched for what was
going to be another hard fought match
as a loss would have jeopardised our
position at the top of the league.
Our stick work training on Monday
practises, looking out for each other as
a team and some fantastic consecutive
passing paid off to produce some of the
best lacrosse yet. We were all smiles
when the 60 minute whistle went off to
finish with an 8-2 win.
We have played some excellent la-
crosse so far this season and working
as a close-knit team has done wonders
to our level of play.
We still have a few more matches to
come but we all ready and raring to go
for what will hopefully be our most
successful season ever.

This was the big one. The crunch
match.Theonetheyhadtowin.Indeed,
the men’s 1st team had up till now not
come up against much resistance from
their opponents in the South-East di-
vision. Four matches, four comfortable
wins. King’s, however, was a different
story : this was the only other unbeaten
team in the league. The winner of this
match would have the title firmly in
sight.
When the King’s delegation trooped
into the sports hall at 2pm, Imperial
knew they were in for a tough fight:
all of the opposing team’s best fencers,
some in the British top 10, were present
and rearing to go. However, backed by
a vociferous and plentiful home crowd
(composed of most of the women’s
team, the 2nd men’s team, and an uni-
dentified Scandinavian) our sabreurs
(Maiyuran ‘Myron’ Ratneswaran, Jean-
Romain Cavaillès and Seung-Wook
‘Wookie’ Lyeo) could step up to the
piste with some confidence.
It was nail-biting stuff from the start,
as Myron and Wookie both lost their
bouts 5-4, showing that they were
ready to scrap for every last point.
With the score at 10-8 in favour of
King’s, Jean-Romain came on and
completely outclassed his opponent,
winning 7-1 and giving Imperial the
lead.
Another four bouts saw King’s claw
back three points to make it 29-27; the
next bout put them in the lead 35-33
despite a valiant attempt by Wookie to
stem the flow of hits. Heroic fencing by
Jean-Romain brought the deficit down
to one point, and with the score at 39-
40 (and absolutely everyone holding
their breath) Myron stepped his game
up another level.
A sublime parry-riposte with one
foot off the back of the piste concluded
a resounding 6-2 win and meant that
Imperial had won the sabre 45-42! The
cheers and applause that ensued even
brought a curious Neil Mosley, from
Sport Imperial, into the hall.
It was now the foilists’ turn to show
that they were made of the same stuff as
their sabre team-mates. The team (Ed
‘Little Ed’ Collier, Alex Morris, Chris
Namih and Indy Leclercq) got off to a
bad start, however, with two 5-2 losses
for Indy and Namih (who nevertheless
put up a good fight against British no.6
Ahmed Rosowsky). Alex then lost the
next bout 5-1, and at 15-5 down, things
were looking a lot less rosy.
Thankfully, Namih then found some
form and won his next match 6-2 in a
very convincing manner. Unfortunate-
ly, Indy confirmed his disappointing
start by throwing away the next bout
with some very poor fencing to leave
the score at 16-25.
Wins by little Ed (who was subbed
in) and Namih reduced the margin to
5 points, but Rosowsky left nothing to
chance and finished off the match with
clinical efficiency. Final score : 45-34 in
favour of King’s.
Imperial were trailing by eight points,
but the match was far from over as it
was now time for our strongest weap-
on to come into play.
The epée team (Alessandro ‘Ale’
Costamagna, Marcello ‘I can’t find my
keys’ Colombino and captain Ed ‘Big
Ed’ Gilhead) knew that victory by the
required margin was well within their
means.
However, the King’s team did include
Myron’s older brother Kaj, who could
have caused some problems. The boys
were never worried, though, as all three
were all on sterling form and didn’t lose
a single match. The score was 15-9 af-
ter the first three bouts, at which point
they never looked back.
‘Il capitano’ was on fire, producing a
5-0 win, and Ale and Marcello looked
untouchable. The cheers got louder
after every point, and when Marcello
got the last hit, making it 45-20, scenes
of unbridled joy unfolded in the sports
hall. Final score: Imperial win 124
– 107.
We’re now top of the league, and
having a good, long, laugh.

Goûter Route. It was a physically and
emotionally exhausting effort, but after
a long, near continuous fourteen hour
push from 2372m, the whole team en-
joyed the incomparable satisfaction of
reaching the summit. The day was only
half done however and this had to be
followed by the long, tiring descent.
Some of the highlights of this time
were the Chere Couloir, with pitches
of steep 80° ice and the Frontier ridge
(Kuffner Route) which led to the sum-
mit of Mont Maudit (4465m).
Credit must go to Leon and James
who successfully led the voie normale
to the summit of Mont Maudit. This
was their first alpine season, but it cer-
tainly didn’t show.
During the final week the fatigue
was showing. Spending a month doing
long routes at altitude had taken it out
of us. More time was spent “relaxing”
in the valley, either climbing on the
sport crags of Chamonix, or running
on the trails on the valley sides. In the
final few days Neil and Rob succeeded
in climbing the classic Frendo spur up
the Aiguille du Midi. This involved
1100 vertical metres of climbing.
The most sleepless night was spent
huddled in down jackets and an emer-
gency blanket watching the shooting
stars and avalanches. This was a fan-
tastic finish to the tour, and I can’t wait
to get back out there next summer!
If you would like to join us for some
more adventures, come along to one of
our meetings held on Tuesdays at 12:30
in dB’s bar in Beit Quad, or get in touch
at outdoor@ic.ac.uk.
