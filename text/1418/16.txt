So, it appears that my rant last week
worked. Möchten sie mein Man-
schaft? handed Shotgun their arses on
a plate. Good. Well done to you, I think
I may give double points too....
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

As promised we are back to
immature words. Unfortunately
Shotgun won it again, you are
becoming like serial killers. But
with word based puzzles and not
prostitutes. I hope everyone else
found (some) FOAMYCUNT, and
as it why it’s foamy I don’t know.
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.

Freshly Squeezed!
Mining for love. Despite the rivalry,
proof that love knows no boundaries is
rife in the RSM this week. A geologi-
cal gem sparkles whenever a certain
ceramic Pott is in the vicinity, living up
to her ‘jewel-ey’ nature .
Not forgetting the events at the
Christmas Ball; a certain boy should
stop Mac-ing on other people’s
women.
LOST. 4.67 billion year old meteorite.
Needed for PhD. If found, don’t step on
it. Seriously.
FOUND. Dignity. Belonging to Cap-
tain Condom. Please collect; it clashes
with our décor, and is destroying our
Persian rug.
Jumper Watch. So Messr. Mech-Eng,
we see you took our advice and have
banished your grey garment to your
chair-drobe (we understand that your
gender prevents you from using furni-
ture correctly).
But the basis of last week’s advice was
for you to develop some sort of jumper
repertoire, not just to replace ol’ reli-
able with the same thing in navy. We’ll
be watching...
Bio-Med Man Whore. Will he be able
to stop his lecherous ways now that his
mail-order bride has arrived from the
other side of the world?
Having been spotted reconnecting
with his French roots in the meantime,
will the kangaroo now be able to oust
the frog?
Lecture Totty. Biology students are
queuing for extra-tuition.
Burning post-lecture questions
anyone?
Con Artists. CSSA have been charg-
ing membership fees, then spending
the money themselves rather than pay-
ing into the club account. Nice one. Ex-
cept that they got caught red-handed,
oops.
Indian Summer. Biologist and Chem-
ist finally get together. If your curry was
as old as your courtship was lengthy, it
would be near-decomposed. Took you
long enough.

Virgo
I received a
complaint about
Virgo’s last
horoscope. A
charitable (read
twat) inhabitant of
Selkirk Hall (Miles 3rd
floor) pointed out that
H from Steps was actually born 18th
November
making him a Scorpio. Cheers pal- I’ve even
brought my bothered face. I make these up
you cretin. Now piss off before I smash you.
Scorpio
Phil Collins. What
a load of shit.
Seriously I have
an overwhelming
urge to bottle him.
I’d take that jail
sentence any day of the week (mabey not
9am Monday morning- that would kinda set
a bad tone for the days to follow). He can’t
say he hasn’t had it coming, what with all that
sentimental bollocks he forced upon us.
Libra
Oh Hai! This week is
not going to go too
well. Imagine a big
fan. Now imagine
that fan now being
covered in copious
amounts of shit. Still with me? Right now
imagine that fan being turned on and fired
up to full power- similar to the power used
in Honda UK’s F1 wind tunnel. Nice thought
huh? Not for you- have fun.
Capricorn
“Ohh look at me
I’m Tomo Roberts,
I won Journalist of
the Year and Paper
of the Year. I’m so
cool.” No mate, all
you did was edit, your team won Paper of the
Year. You won nothing. Your Journalist of the
Year was a ploy by the MD of the Guardian so
he can have you dressed in crotchless trousers
for your placement this summer. Haha. Pint?
Sagittarius
When you make
love, do you look in
the mirror? Who do
you think of, does
it look like me? Do
you tell lies and say
that it’s forever? Do you think twice, or just
touch and see? If you answered yes to these
please let me know on 07884 493418 because
love bites, love bleeds and it’s bringing me to
my knees. Love lives and love dies.
Cancer
No. You cannot
write your own
horoscope. I am
perfectly capable
and need your help
like I do a third
armpit, i.e. not desperately. I might got so far
to say that you’re about as much use as a cock
flavoured lollypop. I wish you the best of luck in
the emotional, and social struggles that seem to
be placing such a demand on you.
Gemini
Next big story of
the week concerns
the fact that you
appear to be having
copious amounts of
sex with your older
sister. Humm I think it be best if you were to
lets say, stop. If you refuse to I am going to tell
her- try explaining that one. For years shes
been having to walk like she’s constipated due
to your rather vicious sexual technique.
Leo
Mate. This week
you’re fighting off
the opposite sex.
They are going to
be all over you like a
dirty rash. Is it your
new haircut or the Ralph Lauren fragrance you
just brought? No. None of these things. Not
even the fact you’re too sexy for your shirt.
Nope. It’s rape. I suggest carrying round a
sawn-off shotgun, or similar implement.
Taurus
I move onto AIDs.
Apparently you
get them from not
strapping it up
before slapping it
up, “always wear a
condom kids” they tell you. Remember when
your mum always told you to wear a helmet on
your bike? Yet you always took it off when you
left her sight. Assuming she’s not there mark-
ing you out of 10 it’s still the same. Isn’t it?
Aries
Looking at the stars
I can see that you
are suffering from
having a small willy.
Don’t worry- it’s not
your fault. All you
need do to make you willy seem huge is get a
tiny girlfriend. Think about the physics, small
willy combined with tiny girl will make you
manhood appear larger than a marrow. But
please, I implore you not to shag a 13 year old.
Pisces
So, you play
Women’s Rugby.
That’s two words
that really shouldn’t
be placed one after
another under
any circumstances. I actually had to fight
my fingers in an effort to get the words on
the page. God knows what’s going to happen
when this is printed 5,000 times. I’m actually
expecting a mini Hiroshima. Shit!
Horoscopes, known to be one of your five-a-day
Aquarius
So I go to my
departmental café
for a bacon bap.
What do I get? Two
bits of crackling
shoved between
bread that had the texture of digestive biscuits,
no butter either- naturally. Then bloke asks me
for £1.50. Seriously, no mate, what you’ve just
given me resembles low grade balsa wood, you
can fuck right off, then a bit further.

Well done to Möchten sie mein Manschaft?

ood morning my socially
challenged chums! And
good afternoon to my
social butterflies who
only got up at noon.
Yours truly is here to sort out your
problems, while making it look so easy
Jodie Marsh would be ashamed. This
week has been rather busy for your
resident shoulder-to-cry-on,
Dear Tamara,
I have recently been hit in the face
with a hockey ball. The swelling and
bruising are really quite bad - people
keep turning to stare in the street!
I’m afraid it may have harmed my
Sean-Bean-esque chiselled looks. How
will I cope?
Bashed-in-babe
Dear Bashed-in-babe,
I had a similar problem when a bottle
of Stalla Artois.
I found that if I was brave, pushed my
best assets forward and went out. Hav-
ing a bit of a bump on my face was an
excellent conversation starter and was
a source of such sympathy that free
drinks were pouring in.
Dear Tamara,
I worked hard to get good GCSEs so I
could get good A levels so I could go to
a good uni and get a good job. Then, I
worked very hard for my A levels so I
could get into a good uni and get a good
job. Then I worked hard at Imperial so
I would get a good job. Now, I am in my
graduating year with no job prospects.
It’s not fair!
Crunched up
Dear Crunched up
I know, I know, it’s not fair, is it? All you
can do is keep applying everywhere
and hope. Alternatively, you could
give up on uni and concentrate on get-
ting a sugar daddy/mummy to sustain
you through these difficult times. The
second route may actually make more
economic sense.
Dear Tamara,
I recently returned to a sticky keyboard,
that Chaz Murdoch had just vacated,
and a picture of my bottom on the
screen. What should I do?
Violated
Dear Violated,
Leave the country.
Dear Tamara,
What is the natural frequency of a pen-
dulum of mass, m, and length, l, if it has
a spring of stiffness, k, attached at the
centre of it’s length?
Mass Damper
Dear Mass damper,
The way to approach this problem is
first to find the moment of inertia about
the pivot of the pendulum. According
to the parallel axis theorem, moment
of inertia, I = (L^2*m). Then, take mo-
ments about the pivot, these are found
to be = -mgL*(theta) - kl(theta), if l is
the length to the centre of the rod and
theta is the angle of displacement of
the pendulum.
The equation of motion is 0 = I(theta
double-dot) + k(theta).
And the natural frequency is found by
omega-n = sqrt(k/m), this equates to
= sqrt((mgL + kl) /mL^2)
= sqrt((g/l)+((k*(l^2))/
(m*(L^2)))
Easy.
Dear Tamara,
I can’t seem to arrive at the destination
duringintercourse.Thingsarefineman-
ually but as soon as a girl is involved I
can’t seem to unload my protein shot.
What can I do? I’m desperate?
Clogged pipes
Dear Clogged Pipes,
Either the girls you try with are too ugly
or you prefer boy bit to girls’. There is
a third option where you should see a
doctor but that is out of my expertise.
Option 1, ugly girls: You need to up
your game and get with.
Option 2, you are gay: You will find
that you have a lot more success with
members of the sex you find attrac-
tive. It may come as a shock if you have
managed to reach such a mature age
without realising which way you swing.
Life is all about self discovery.
