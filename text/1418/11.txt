O
h Axl Rose, why don’t
you just leave Dr. Pep-
per alone, yeah? I know
they promised to give
everyone in America
a Dr. Pepper if you finished your al-
bum before the end of 2008, but why
couldn’t you just laugh it off as a joke
and go about your probably bizarre and
perverse daily life. Why do you have to
take everything so seriously?
This is of course the news that Axl
Rose’s lawyers are threatening to sue
Dr. Pepper over their perceived reluc-
tance to honour their offer of a free Dr.
Pepper for everyone in America (ex-
cept estranged Guns N’ Roses mem-
bers Slash and Buckethead) after the
release of the long awaited Guns N’
Roses album ‘Chinese Democracy’ on
the 23rd of November. I don’t think I
even need to comment on the standard
of the album, other than the great John
Cage who famously once said “There
is no noise, only sound” obviously
hadn’t experienced this oral massacre.
But that was to be expected. My main
source of despair at this whole fiasco
is Rose’s utterly humourless reaction
to what was originally quite a funny PR
stunt. I therefore feel that it is my duty
as a big-shot musical pundit to add my
voice to the ever increasing rumble of
bewilderment.
When you first think about it, the ab-
surdity of an 80s hair-metal icon taking
a much loved soft drinks brand to court
has a humorous twang to it. It is easy to
imagine the courtroom testimony of a
Peter Sinclair
Music Editor
jovial Kool Aid Man-esque corporate
icon opposite a fuming Axl Rose. But
after a bit of a laugh at Rose’s expense, I
feel a bit guilty - I can’t help but find it a
bit of a sad and desperate display from
a man long past the peak of his career,
though still clinging onto his impen-
etrable rock-star ego. “How dare they
mock Axl Rose”, he thinks (I am certain
that Axl Rose thinks of himself in the
third person), “Dr. Pepper will live to
regret this.” Despite my love of Dr. Pep-
per and my disapproval of Axl’s actions
towards what is my second favourite
soft drink, I feel a bit of sympathy for
Rose, and also to the people who knew
him before he attained the disgraceful
heights of fame which destroyed his
sense of reality so totally in his heyday,
because they have lost forever what I’m
sure was a perfectly reasonable person
into the vacuous netherworld of un-
touchable superstardom.
On a separate note, big fat props
go to the boys at MusicMetric.com
for the fabulous new listings page this
week. Hopefully it will be a weekly
thing so no one ever has to spend their
hard-earned dollars on a shitty copy
of TimeOut. Their actual website, a
kind of customisable music listings
and searchings type of thing, is going
to be fully operational in a few weeks
so watch this space. In the mean time,
they’ve got a competition to win a
couple of iPods in exchange for about
two seconds of market research, so it’s
worth a look anyway. That’s it, on with
the music section! Hope you like it.
Axl Rose vs.
THE MAN
It was a night of blood, sweat and even
a few tears. After an hour and a half of
screaming his lungs out, Pink Eyes, lead
singer of the Canadian hardcore mob
known as ‘Fucked Up’, descends from
the stage and proceeds to hug each and
every person still standing in the room.
It is a surreal moment, where the 150
anonymous strangers assembled in the
venue all know that they have just wit-
nessed something extraordinary.
Rewind a couple of hours, and it is a
completelydifferentscenealtogetherin
Camden’s Barfly. The night is an ‘XFM
X-posure Live’ event, hosted by ora-
cle of the hotly-tipped, John Kennedy.
On the bill, three very different bands,
though all on the heavier end of the
musical spectrum. It all kicks off with
Invasion, a bass-less London trio
consisting of two girls and one geek.
They play a solid opening perform-
ance, ploughing through their interest-
ing hybrid of stoner-rock and thrash
metal, laced with soul vocals. Unfortu-
nately for these hard-rocking amigos,
the growing crowd hasn’t come here to
listen to a half-hour System of a Down
meets Aretha Franklin gimmick, and
just claps politely as Invasion leave the
stage.
Thank God - or Satan, in this case
- for Rolo Tomassi then. Hailing from
the unholy land that is Sheffield, they
set their local scene ablaze three years
ago and have been touring up and
down the country since. As they launch
into their first furious piece of mad-
ness, it becomes clear Rolo Tomassi
are a league above the other so-called
‘screamo’ bands. A more accurate de-
scription of their music is ‘spazzcore’.
They play very fast math-metal, all
screaming and kicking, topped off
by insane Crystal Castles-style synth
spewing all over the place, like vomit
from a kitten’s mouth. The fact that
vocals are provided both by schizo-
phrenic self-mutilating keyboard-play-
er James Spence AND his lovely sister
Eva, who hops around stage like a 12
year old school girl on crack, makes the
whole ordeal even more charming. To
be honest, I didn’t think such a pretty
Camden Barfly gets
Fucked the Fuck up
girl could make noises like that outside
of Coffee Break Ravi’s bed. But some-
where between the soul-destroying
metal, spurious fragments of jazz and
psychedelic noise segments, there are
some insightful moments of calm and
melody in their songs. It really is aston-
ishing to see such a young band already
masters of their trade, playing with
Move on! Nothing to see here as none
of the remixes in this compilation of
Ladyhawke’s ‘My Delirium’ add any-
thing to an already merely passable
track. The original has Ladyhawke
(a.k.a. Pip Brown) singing about her
sexual frustrations through some ter-
ribly indistinctive vocals. It’s not par-
ticularly catchy, so much so that even
though it’s only been half an hour since
I last heard it, I’m struggling to re-
member any hooks or melody. She is,
however, a competent instrumentalist
and the track has a good energy, which
bizarrely is something that each of the
eight remixes presented here promptly
siphon away. The result is 40 minutes
of grindingly generic house beats that
completely scupper the opportunity of
making this track in the least bit inter-

esting; play any of these in a club and
you’ll most likely find people vacat-
ing the dance floor. Still curious? The
‘Chateau Marmont Remix’ was the
only one that made me open my media
player out of curiosity, but even this
fizzles away over its running time. For
diehard Ladyhawke completists only.
Gregory Power speed and precision, not forgetting
great stage presence. Rolo Tomassi get
the first moshpits of the night going,
as fans of the band pile on top of each
other and kick people in the face. The
older members of the audience stand
back and let the kids have their fun, as
it all gets a little too loud, spastic and
just plain crazy. Still, nobody is left un-
touched by the spectacle and all in all
Rolo Tomassi go down extremely well.
Hell, I even bought their album.
Still though, everyone has come
here for one very simple reason, and
that is to witness the miracle that the
New York Times refers to as the “Band
With an Unprintable Name”. They’re
called Fucked Up, and that’s just what
they are. Formed in Toronto in 2001,
the members are only known by their
ridiculously strange aliases, for exam-
ple guitarist ‘10,000 Marbles’ or bassist
‘Slumpy’ (a girl, if you hadn’t guessed).
They are masters at spreading around
misinformation about the band online
and in interviews. Influenced by first
and second-wave hardcore bands like
Minor Threat but also Pink Floyd’s
prog-rock, they are a rarity in today’s
musical world. For years they refused
to release a full CD, opting instead for
the 7” vinyl format. Shunned by ma-
jor labels because of their true punk
ethics, they received glowing reviews
in punk fanzines for every one of the
30 two-track records they released
over the years. The art work and lyr-
ics, full of symbols and imagery, have
always proudly displayed the band’s
anarchist beliefs, and their live shows
quickly gained a reputation for being
chaotic and ridiculously violent. After
the release of their first record ‘Hidden
World’ in 2006, Fucked Up crept out
of the hardcore punk underworld and
rose to the surface to start gathering
fans all over the world. After their first
European tour in 2007, they famously
played a concert in the men’s wash-
room of MTV Live, during which fans
pillaged and spray-painted the entire
place before getting kicked out. Finally,
on October 7 2008, Fucked Up released
their second album The Chemistry Of
Common Life, this time receiving rave
reviews from all over the music world,
even featuring on the front cover of
NME. This is down to the incorpora-
tion of more rock and, dare I say it, in-
die melodies and vocals into their mu-
sic. But at their heart, they still remain
as hardcore as can be in this day and
age without sounding like a nostalgia
trip.
So you can imagine my anticipation
as I await the arrival of Fucked Up on
the Barfly’s stage. The excitement is
palpable, as everyone in the sold-out
venue has most definitely been playing
the new LP endlessly in preparation for
tonight. But instead of some big theat-
rical entrance, the band step on stage
smiling, beer in hand and proceed to
set up their own instruments, doing
their own soundcheck. No roadies for
these rockstars, evidently. Still, every-
one seems to be holding their breath
until the first note is played. Now a
six-piece consisting of three guitars
(just for that extra wall of distortion),
they joke about with the audience un-
til suddenly the lights dim. They then
proceed to blow everyone’s brains out
with the opening riff to ‘Son The Fa-
ther’, the first track off their new record.
As soon as singer Pink Eyes, lets out his
unmistakable gut-wrenching growl, all
hell breaks loose. The front rows of the
packed venue quickly turn into a giant
mosh pit, complete with people div-

forehead, he still
spit his lyrics
as if he was

crystal meth”
...From previous page
ing over each other, punching the air
as if fighting off an invisible rapist, and
running from one side of the room to
the other in hysteric fits of laughter. It
might sound a little strange, but the
energy and raw power exuded by this
band is enough to make anyone go cra-
zy and join in with the other wackjobs.
The crowd’s immediate reaction is
certainly down to Fucked Up’s abra-
sive and anthemic songs, but live this
band are all about stage presence. And
though all the members are awesome
musicians and definitely entertaining,
it really is all down to one man. Or
should I say one big, hairy grizzly bear.
And that bear is Pink Eyes. He is a mas-
sive ball of fury and an absolute living
legend. There is no voice comparable
to his in all of rock, and no one with
such a tendency for self-destruction.
He throws himself around the stage,
shoves the microphone into audience
members’ faces so they can scream
out the lyrics (which they all know of
course), and strangles himself with the
microphone lead. Oh but it gets bet-
ter. After tearing his shirt off during
the first song, he repeatedly moons the
audience with his humongous, beastly
badonkadunk of an ass. Of course
Pink Eyes’ posterior is greeted by mas-
sive cheers and claps from the crowd
throughout the night. But that’s not all!
After the third song, he smacks himself
in the forehead with his microphone,
and though he starts to bleed from the
cut, he still spits his lyrics like Genghis
Khan on crystal meth. Throughout the
next hour and a half, this hairy bas-
tard repeatedly jumps down from the
stage, pushes past the crowd, knocking
people over in the moshpit, as well as
picking up the biggest guys he can find
and spinning them round his shoulders
before throwing them back onto their
friends. It is pure insanity, but every-
one is LOVING it. He doesn’t miss a
lyric either, as he always keeps hold
of the microphone and gets people to
sing along with him. The crowd aren’t
so much watching Fucked Up playing
a gig, as taking part in a giant rock n’
roll orgy.
Fucked Up play through most of the
tracks off their new album, including
the incredibly powerful ‘Black Albino
Bones’ and ‘Twice Born’, as well as
some of their hardcore classics. ‘Bait-
ing the Public’ sees the moshers from
the front climbing on stage and slam-
dancing wildly before diving back into
the crowd. There’s even a midget sing-
ing along to every word.
So when Fucked Up reach the end of
their set, they are showered in praise
and adoration, and rightfully so. If any-
one deserves the media attention and
interest of music lovers everywhere
right now, it really is Fucked Up. As
stupid and ridiculous as they (and
their name) might sound, no one plays
with as much passion and genuine love
for their music and their fans as they
do. And if that wasn’t enough, they’re
changing the face of music by making
such a loud and aggressive style of mu-
sic as hardcore into something almost
mainstream, certainlycatchy and musi-
cally ambitious. Kind of like the Beatles
did to rock then? Fucked Up-mania is
already hitting the world. As Pink Eyes
points out himself in his hilarious in-
between-song banter, he was recently
voted “Number 11 Coolest Person In
The World” by NME. And his response
to this: “Why not Number One??”.

So once it is all over, as some people
start to leave, slightly deafened and
their brains unable to process what
they have just witnessed, I step up to
Pink Eyes, shaking everyone’s hand and
thanking them for coming. He finishes
telling the midget how much he ap-
preciated his presence, before turning
round to me. I tell him how ridiculous-
ly fucking awesome he and his band
are, and he just grabs and hugs me, tell-
ing me to come back anytime. And it
was there, between those huge sweaty
manboobs, that I understood the true
meaning of the word “hardcore”.
