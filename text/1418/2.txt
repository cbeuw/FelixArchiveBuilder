Imperial College
Healthcare is Nicer
than NICE
The Sabbatical Review Group met this
Tuesday to discuss the possibility of
separating the current role of the Dep-
uty President (Education & Welfare)
into two positions. The idea was origi-
nally conceived last year by the then
President Stephen Brown and Deputy
President (Education & Welfare) Kirsty
Patterson, the latter of which is cur-
rently the Honorary Secretary of the
City and Guilds College Union and is
still in favour of the split.
A large proportion of other univer-
sities have separate positions for edu-
cation and welfare in the sabbatical
structure, which some have used as an
argument for having the new position.
By splitting the roles, it would seem,
at least on paper, that the two roles
would better tend to the needs of the
students.
One of the biggest criticism that has
come from the current education and
welfare structure is that there are many
student demands that fail to be met, for
example improvement of the prsonal
tutor system. This could be one reason
why Imperial College has the lowest
student satisfaction rating of all the
top 10 universities in the country, an
issue that was raised in the RWB meet-
ing this week. At the end of each aca-
demic term, students fill out the SOLE
form where they rate their courses and
lecturers. However it was pointed out
that students feel very little action is
seen from these results.
When asked for her comments, Han-
nah Theodorou, the Deputy President
(Education & Welfare) points out that
“significant changes do come about as
a result of surveys such as SOLE. How-
ever, we have traditionally, as a College
and a Union, not been very good at
communicating these to the students.
This is particularly time-consuming
and as such has usually been sidelined
because of other projects”. She went on
to add “The issue isn’t necessarily that
my workload is far greater than anyone
else’s; all the sabbaticals are worked
off their feet. It’s the fact that my role
has the widest scope for improving the
student’s education experience whilst
at Imperial and year-on-year, it is the
sabbatical role which fails to meet the
majority of their aims because it is so
broad”.
Another key point that was raised by
the group is that Imperial is truly inde-
pendent, as it is no longer affiliated to
the National Union of Students [NUS]
or the University of London Union
[ULU], and as a result the representa-
tion of our students on a national scale
is more important now than ever.
With each of the arguments for split-
ting the position, there were also the
reasons against the split. One main
concern that was raised was that the
creation of the new position would
mean that money would be moved
from other sources, with the biggest
fear being that money would be taken
from clubs and societies. This is not
the case, as the need for an additional
sabbatical would have to be agreed by
College Council, with the extra money
coming from the College directly. An-
other concern would be the overlap
between the two positions and the
high need for communication.
Towards the end of the meeting it
was suggested that instead of splitting
this role the Faculty Union Presidents
could become full time sabbaticals,
which would mean that they could po-
tentially alleviate the workload of the
DPEW. This was supported with the
arguments that currently the faculties
are able to deal with education and
welfare matters relating to their facul-
ty. However, this would mean the crea-
tion of two more sabbaticals instead of
just the one.
However, some students fear that by
creating a faculty sabbatical, it would
mean that the there would be more
segregation of students form the cen-
tral union, as is currently the case
with Faculty of Medicine. Hannah also
pointed out that a lot of her workload
is currently not Faculty- specific.
The issue is being taken to the next
Union Council on the 15th December.

Four might become five by this time next year
Imperial College Healthcare has
snubbed the NHS drugs rationing
body, the National Institute of Clini-
cal Excellence (NICE), by setting up its
own ‘in-house’ version. The trust will
decide whether to prescribe drugs to
its patients that have been deemed not
cost effective by NICE or have not yet
been approved.
This move by Imperial comes after
the recent controversy that many new
and more effective cancer treatments
have been rejected by the NICE purely
on cost grounds. These drug treat-
ments, however, have been proven to
prolong cancer patients’ lives and are
also freely provided on the Continent.
As these drugs are not available on the
NHS, many cancer patients have there-
fore had to pay for them privately in
order to access the new treatments. In
some cases this can cost up to £5,000
per month.
The situation is worsened by the
NHS rule that states a patient cannot
be both a private and NHS patient at
the same time for the treatment of the
same condition. Thus patients who
had been topping up their NHS care
by paying for the new cancer drugs
privately, have found themselves ef-
fectively banned from NHS treatment.
This of course has incurred very heavy
financial costs for many cancer patients
paying for all aspects of their care.
The government initially backed this
rather hard- line stance on patients
turning to private health care. Their
reasoning being that they did not want
to create a ‘two-tier’ healthcare system
whereby patients lying next to each
other on a hospital ward would be get-
ting different levels of treatment. How-
ever,afterafewhighprofilecourtcases,
angry front-page headlines and intense
lobbying from high profile doctors, in-
cluding Imperial’s own Professor Karol
Sikora, the government finally backed
down and loosened up the restrictions
on private ‘top-up’ treatment. In light
of the new regulations, Imperial Col-
lege Healthcare has decided to contra-
dict NICE and prescribe the expensive
new drug treatments banned from the
NHS, where appropriate, and absorb
the cost from its £800m budget.
The trust is made up of Hammer-
smith Hospital, Queen Charlotte’s and
Chelsea, St Mary’s, Charing Cross, the
Western Eye Hospital and Imperial
College London following a merger last
year. It is now one of the largest trusts
in the country with a budget at least
twice that of the average hospital and
was ranked the third safest hospital in
England only a few weeks ago.
Not only that, but Imperial College
Healthcare now has its own new cross-
faculty Drug Discovery Centre. Profes-
sor Steve Smith, chief executive and
principal of the trust, recently ranked
11th in the 50 most powerful people in
the NHS, said the trust has such a large
research base that the drugs may have
been developed by its own experts or
that the trust is involved in clinical tri-
als and can enrol patients. Thus it is
best placed to decide what the most ef-
fective treatments for its patients are.
Imperial College Healthcare may
have shown that it is a force to be
reckoned with by taking matters into
its own hands. It will, however, be in-
teresting to see whether its defiance
in favour of patient care sets a trend
for the rest of the country’s healthcare
providers.
The government has begun issuing
compulsory I.D. cards to non-EU stu-
dents living in this country. Students
applying for a visa will be forced to pay
between £295 and £500 as part of the
visa application process and will be
charged a £30 fee if they lose the card.
Critics have accused the government
of using foreign students (a group less
able to resist than UK citizens) as guin-
ea pigs for the controversial scheme.
Between 50,000 and 60,000 foreign
students are expected to receive cards
by March with the scheme extended to
home and EU students in 2010.
Foreign students will be required to
renew their visas in person, at a number
of centres around the country; a centre
in Croydon will serve London. Biomet-
ric data including fingerprints will be
collected at the centres but eye scans
have been dropped. Liberal Democrat
home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne
said: “Foreign nationals, who cannot
vote, are perfect guinea pigs for a gov-
ernment wanting to test a deeply un-
popular and unworkable policy.”
Other charges levelled at the scheme
are that it is ineffective and serves
merely to reduce the general public’s
aversion to I.D. cards. Phil Booth, head
of the national No2ID campaign group
said, “The Home Office is trying to
salami slice the population to get this
scheme going in any way they can”. He
added “The volume of foreign nation-
als involved is minuscule so it won’t do
anything to tackle illegal immigration.”
The Conservative Party similarly op-
poses the scheme. Shadow home sec-
retary Dominic Grieve said, “The Gov-
ernment are kidding themselves if they
think ID cards for foreign nationals
will protect against illegal immigration
or terrorism - since they don’t apply to
those coming here for less than three
months”. Foreign students will have no
choice about the I.D. cards as they will
be refused the right to stay in the coun-
try if they reject the cards.
The government has ignored oppo-
sition to the scheme. Home Secretary
Jacqui Smith claimed in November that
people ‘can’t wait for ID cards’ adding
that “I regularly have people coming
up to me and saying they don’t want to
wait that long [2012].” The government
believes that the identity card scheme
will reduce illegal immigration and
make it easier for employers to ensure
they don’t employ illegal immigrants.
Jacqui Smith said that employers and
colleges want to be confident people
are who they say they are and added
“We all want to see our borders more
secure, and human trafficking, organ-
ised immigration crime, illegal work-
ing and benefit fraud tackled. ID cards
for foreign nationals, in locking people
to one identity, will deliver in all these
areas,”
Some support for the scheme exists
with Sir Andrew Green of Migration-
watch UK saying the cards should be
supported.
“We welcome the introduction of
ID cards for foreign nationals as part
of wider measures to tackle illegal im-
migration,” but Director of civil rights
group Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti said:
“The public will yawn at yet another
re-launch of this scheme and if the
card came with loyalty points, we still
wouldn’t buy it. Picking on foreigners
first is divisive politics; as costly to our
race relations as our purses.”
The cost of the scheme has come
under attack with current estimates
putting the price at £4.7 billion. Critics
have decried the unnecessary scheme
as a waste at a time of economic crisis.
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokes-
man Chris Huhne said “This hugely ex-
pensive scheme will have no impact on
crime, terrorism, illegal immigration
or illegal working as foreign nationals
already have passports with visas. This
intrusion on British liberty is com-
pletely unnecessary.” adding “When
the rest of us are forced to carry ID
cards, this scheme will prove to be a
laminated Poll Tax.”
There has been significant student
opposition at a number of universi-
ties around the country. Students in
Liverpool protested with anti-I.D. card
group “Say no to ID cards” and Man-
chester University students outside the
Home Office building. ICU President
Jenny Morgan told felix that she’s “yet
to see one good argument for the ID
cards, whereas there are so many argu-
ments against.”
She then went on to say that “per-
haps we should remind the govern-
ment of the Human Rights Act. The
government should be ashamed at us-
ing international students who could
be vulnerable due to the language bar-
rier and possibly not knowing what the
norm is in Britain.”

Zohair Abu-Shaban, the Palestinian
student that was prevented from tak-
ing up his place at Imperial this year,
is suspected by the Israeli government
of links to terrorist activities, felix has
learned.
In response to enquiries about Zo-
hair the Israeli Embassy in London’s
Public Affairs Department sent an
email to the Union detailing the reason
why he was prevented from crossing
into Israel.
felix has seen this email which says
that “he [Zohair] is wanted for ques-
tioning in Israel as he is suspected of
being involved with terrorist activity”.
The email does not specify any further
details but it goes on to state that: “If
he tries to cross the Israeli border he
will be arrested immediately.”
Before applying to Imperial College,
Zohair had a Fulbright Scholarship to
study at the University of Conneticut.
When he tried to leave for the U.S. ear-
lier in 2008 he was detained for 2 hours
and interrogated by Israeli security
personnel about possible affiliations
with Hamas, which Zohair strenuously
rejected: “I am independent from Ha-
mas, I have no affliation to it, I have no
relation to its activities.” His U.S. visa
was eventually cancelled on the basis
of secret Israeli evidence. “I cannot
see the evidence and so have no op-
portunity to contest it,” wrote Zohair
in response.
felix was unable to contact Zohair
personally about the latest develop-
ments, however he has previously stat-
ed his “abhorrence of violence”. felix is
unable to comment on the credibility
of the accusations and will report any
updates on the situation as and when
they are received. It is as yet unknown
whether the accusations will have an
impact on his deferred place to study
at Imperial.
Imperial students celebrate
World Aids Day
Student’s from this years SHAG team managed to get a image
of a red ribbon onto the Queen’s Tower earlier this week to raise
awareness of World Aids Day. Also earlier this week, members of
the SHAG team managed to recreate a human ribbon, also to raise
awareness of the day. If this isn’t enough, the entire centre page of
felix this week is dedicated to World Aids Day. Enjoy!
Will this affect his place here?
