I
t is seeming increasingly inevi-
table that the next President of
the United States of America
will be Barack Obama.
The Illinois Senator is ahead
by between 4 and 14 points in every
poll released in the last few days.
The popularity of McCain has de-
creased since the introduction of his
running mate, “pitbull” Palin and the
worsening of the financial crisis.
Despite the Obama campaign pull-
ing ahead, it is not all over yet; elec-
tion day is November 4th. McCain will
have to produce a miracle to get back
in contention.
McCain is progressively using dirtier
tactics as he feels the presidency slip-
ping away. Obama is ahead in many re-
cent polls geared towards presidential
qualities. These results are horrifying
for McCain who has based his cam-
paign around attempts to undermine
Obama’s character. If McCain is to
have any chance of victory in today’s
anti-Republican climate, he must por-
tray himself as the one “ready to lead”.
Generally speaking, there are three
ways to do this. First, he can make him-
self look more presidential; second, he
can make Obama look less so; third, he
can employ a combination of the two.
As the situation stands, however,
Mccain’s chances seem to be diminish-
ing, to pull of victory from his current
position would be nothing short of
miraculous.
