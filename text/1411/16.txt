Fashion Editor – Daniel Wan
Daniel Wan
Fashion Editor
Y
ou’ve survived the first
week back at College. Ma-
zeltov. Nice to see you’ve
got back into the old habit
of picking up your weekly
felix, laughing hysterically at the dia-
phragm-punishing commentary, then
throwing your copy into the wind until
some poor unsuspecting Fresher gets
hit in the face by it. He picks it up, and
the cycle continues.
It unnervingly feels like I hadn’t
suffered from three mind-numbing
months of London suburbia over the
summer. No emotional goodbyes this
time around, just absences, one by one,
from our table at the local pub. When
I found myself sitting in the Moon Un-
der Water in Watford alone, I knew it
was time to return my sweaty backside
to Imperial.
Unprofessional as this will sound,
I’ve been completely out of the loop of
anything current. Including news, and
more than likely, fashion. The Internet
has its wonderfully life-filling hands
tightly positioned around me. For the
past couple of weeks, no Internet has
meant that my life has been a bland
blob of ignorance. Hence, I apologise if
my section for this week reads like ‘The
Origin of Species’; outdated, boring
trundle that everyone already knows.
But then some say ‘The Origin of Spe-
cies’ was revolutionary. But then some
people at the time thought Charles
Darwin was the devil and wanted his
finch-loving head on a pike.
I’m talking about Charles Darwin
in the Fashion section. What is wrong
with me? What’s wrong with you? Why
are you still reading, fool? I wouldn’t
be. In fact, I’m not, and I’m still typing.
You know what? I pitty the fool. And
yes, with a double ‘t’. Half-heartedly
point that spelling error out.
felix has taken some flak these last
couple of weeks. Granted, we have not
hit the ground running this year. I don’t
think felix ever does, mainly down to
the fact that half of last year’s editorial
team have graduated and crawled out
into the big bad world of work, what
I affectionately refer to as the getting-
cucumbers-and-other-such-sizeable-
vegetables-shoved-in-my-arse period
of my life.
We are a student newspaper, not the
Guardian, not The Daily Star, but felix.
Our readers are the students of Impe-
rial, and to have such a large readership
of thousands in such close community
is rare. We embrace that by referencing
to the comic value and trends only you
lot will truly understand; namely the
sex ratio. The fact that a bloke is Fash-
ion Editor probably proves that point.
So lighten up. It’s all in jest, and enjoy
the paper for what it is.
I’ve already had to omit Fashion from
the last issue due to lack of time and
contributions. To stop such travesties
reoccurring, come write for felix Fash-
ion. Write your opinions on the latest
trend, a review of your mum’s ward-
robe. My point is: anything (related
to Fashion), and email me at fashion.
felix@imperial.ac.uk. You never know,
your mum might disown you for claim-
ing she always looking dowdy, and then
all you’ve got is felix for that motherly(-
esque) bosom you blatantly crave.
Fashion-spotting on campus
Nada Jumabhoy roams Imperial College for its best dressed students this week
T
he felix Fashion team
sent out a team of all-
tutting, all-scrutinising
fashionistas to find the
best-dressed students
of Imperial College.
There is always an element of chance
involved. Not everyone is going to look
their best everyday, and not every-
one looks harmless, lost and innocent
enough for us to pounce on.
We targeted Freshers, but tried not
to ignore the upper years. Sadly, we’ve
missed the very first week or two when
all the Freshers dress up in their best
outfits every day, even to go to a five
minute meeting with their crusty and
bearded personal tutor. First impres-

sions are no longer and they are happi-
ly settling down into the campus-wide
habit of slumming around in whatever
they find themselves in from the night
before.
Most people we approached were
happy to pose for us, but they all in-
sisted they weren’t looking their best.
Modesty is still rife amongt the first
years, then. The team especially took
to Hoon’s faux fur trimmed top from
Zara. It was the first thing we noticed
about him as he sat in the Union have a
pre-lecture pint.
We also asked them what they
thought of the fashion and style of their
fellow students at College. The major-
ity were reluctant to give a truthful

“It’s non-existent,
isn’t it?”
opinion. We were wondering why, but
it was obvious a lot of Freshers didn’t
think too highly of the hoody and jeans
culture that sitting in a computer lab
all day harbours.
Being simply and comfortably
dressed does not mean you have to
look too ragged though. Ez, who we
found chatting to his friends on the
Queen’s Lawn, was simply wearing a
polo T-shirt and jeans. It was nothing
outstanding, but that’s exactly what we
loved about it. The solid blue and black
theme worked really well for him, fin-
ished off stylishly with a rather volu-
mised kaftan scarf around his neck.
Anjali, a second year Bioengineer
was hanging out by the SAF, and she
epitomised the aforementioned com-
fortable and stylish combination well.
Her outfit was a combination of her
own stuff and her boyfriend’s. The
oversized rugby shirt and belt formed
a sweet dress with a lot of character.
Since Imperial is such a culturally di-
verse place, we decided to feature Vic
Man, due to his love of Korean cloth-
ing. He was wearing a monochrome
casual tuxedo and jeans outfit, with an
underlay of vivid scarlet provided by
his cardigan.
To all those that have been featured:
smile, you’re now famous. For a week
at least. To those that aren’t, but your
best kit on, you’ll never know when
we’ll be roaming again.
