T
he way a woman walk
could show if she has or-
gasms or not. New re-
search published in the
Journal of Sexual Medi-
cine claims that trained sexologists can
tell whether a woman is having vaginal
orgasms induced by penetrative sex,
simply by looking at the way she walks.
A number of previous studies have
determined that clitoral and vaginal
orgasms are two separate physiologi-
cal phenomena dependent on different
nervous pathways. Vaginal orgasms
have been shown to benefit women’s
health: penile stimulation of the vagus
nerve in the cervix is beneficial to car-
diovascular health and also helps other
physiological processes such as coping
with stress. Women with more vagi-
nal orgasms also have better relation-
ship quality. The new study looked at
16 Belgian women, half of whom had
vaginal orgasms and half of whom did
not. These women were filmed walking
down the street and trained sexologists
then looked at videos to determine
whether a woman was orgasmic or not,
based on her walk. They were able to
do so correctly in 81% of the cases. The
authors say that an observer may tell
if a woman has orgasms by looking at
her gait “that comprises fluidity, ener-
gy, sensuality, freedom and absence of
flaccid and locked muscles”. Apparent-
ly, the orgasmic women have “greater
pelvic and vertebral rotation and stride
length” and the muscle blocks may be
responsible for impairment of some
women’s sexual potential.
From an evolutionary point of view,
if one could tell by walk alone if woman
has orgasms and if this is related to her
health and therefore physical fitness,
one would expect men to have evolved
ways of seeing this. It might be interest-
ing to see if any man, not just trained
sexologists, could guess this. Even men
in a relationship pay attention to sin-
gle, attractive women. In fact, meeting
a single woman leads men to view their
own partners in a more negative light
then they do, reports a study published
in Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology. The study tested 71 men,
half of which were introduced to a sin-
gle, attractive woman who flirted with
them, other half with a woman who
ignored them. After this experience
they were asked if they would forgive
their partner if she cancelled a date, or
gossiped about their private lives. Men
who had another woman flirting with
them were 12% less forgiving. Pre-
sumably the experience of a complete
stranger flirting with them led them to
believe they were too cool to be messed
around. Maybe it increased their self-
perceived mate value. Interestingly,
for women, the trend was opposite: af-
ter meeting an attractive, single man,
they were 17% more likely to forgive
their partners and so were working to
strengthen their current relationship.

This weekly,
hour-long pod-
cast is a humor-
ous and critical
look at current
controversies in
pseudo-science
and the par-
anormal. Some of the items will make
your collective jaws drop. Particularly
enjoyable/worrying is news of PETA’s
‘evidence’ of a link between cows’ milk
and autism. Luckily for us, they have a
solution: lobby Ben & Jerry’s to replace
cows’milkintheiricecreamwith...wait
for it... human breast milk! I checked:
not an April fool special. Also excellent,
an interview with Matthew Chapman,
Darwin’s great great-grandson. Despite
ending up in the movie business, he is
active in the creation-evolution debate
in the US and is currently petitioning
the presidential candidates to debate
on science issues. We wish him luck.
Although a bit long, this podcast will
keep you awake on your underground
journey and provide you with intellec-
tual ammunition for moron-baiting.

This 10-minute
weekly podcast
aims to, accord-
ing to its web-
site, “blast away
the widespread
pseudo-scienc-
es that infect
popular culture one topic at a time.”
This week, Brian Dunning looks at the
evidence for so-called ‘scalar weap-
ons’, sometimes attributed to Serbo-
Croatian genius Nikola Tesla. Dunning
brings us up to date with the latest
‘evidence’ from scalar proponents and
then gradually debunks their ideas one
by one, including the notion that Tesla
(who invented the alternating current
motor) had anything to do with scalar
weapons. He also explores the ten-
dency of conspiracy theorists to hitch
their ideas onto genuine science – such
as scalar field theory – and use jargon
and pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo
to pass off science fiction as fact.

This is the
official
podcast
of Skeptic
Magazine
In the US the
‘skeptical move-
ment’ is grow-
ing like never before, largely due to a
popular backlash against the anti-sci-
ence stance of the current administra-
tion and at the forefront of the trend
is the Skeptics Society magazine and
its sister podcast, Skepticality. With
fans such as Apple CEO Steve Jobs,
and a growing audience of converts
both sides of the pond, one would ex-
pect some hard-hitting broadcasting,
but sadly the programme too often
slips into navel-gazing verging on ar-
rogance. That said, once past the labo-
rious preamble we get to hear a lively
panel discussion (at, of all places, a sci-
fi convention) from some of the move-
ment’s biggest names, including ‘The
Amazing’ James Randi , on the future
of scepticism. The mood was optimis-
tic in a smug, back-slapping kind of
way; odd when the next Vice-President
could be a woman who believes dino-
saurs and humans were around at the
same time.

Be warned: this
podcast is not
for the faint of
heart. A lengthy
conversation
between the
presenter D.J.
Grothe (of the cultish-sounding ‘Cen-
tre for Inquiry’) and guest Michael
Lackey on ‘black liberation atheism’
– when black intellectuals decided to
renounce Christianity as a force for
repression. I started off intrigued and
ended up swamped in a confusing bog
of postmodernist jargon (science is a
“fiction” constructed by humans, the
concept of truth is just an illusion... I
could go on). Worth a listen, if only for
Grothe accusing all postmodernists of
“intellectual masturbation.”

A quarter of all mammal species
are at risk of disappearing forever,
according to an update to the Red
List released last week by the Inter-
national Union for Conservation
of Nature (IUCN) – the world’s
oldest and largest environmental
network which is responsible for
the publication of the Red List of
Threatened Species.
This new update to the Red List,
published at the World Conserva-
tion Congress in Barcelona last
week, shows at least 1,141 of the
listed 5,487 mammal species have
threatened populations in the wild.
Potentially the situation could be
far worse as 836 species of mam-
mals are classed as data deficient,
as their populations are unknown.
Julia Marton-Lefèvre, the ICUN
Director General said, “Within our
lifetime, hundreds of species could
be lost as a result of our own ac-
tions, a frightening sign of what
is happening to the ecosystems
where they live.”

While this may paint a very bleak
future for mammals there was some
good news which came out of the data,
such as that regarding the African Ele-
phant which has been reclassified from
Vulnerable to Near Threatened. This
reflects the increasing populations in
southern and eastern Africa after their
population crash in the 1980’s due to
the Ivory Trade. Due to well-planned
conservation measures in recent years,
40 species of mammals showed signs
of recovery, giving hope that a mass
extinction crisis can be avoided.
Several new initiatives have also
been launched during the congress,
including a project by Google allowing
Google Earth users to view the world’s
Marine Protected Areas, as well as
to share pictures, videos and stories
about them. The aim of this and other
similar projects ultimately is to try and
get people more aware and involved in
conservation.
The huge increase in endangered
species in this update to the Red
List shows is a warning call that
cannot be ignored.
