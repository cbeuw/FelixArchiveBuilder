music and attempts to suss out the Vessels and find out where the ship is heading...
E
veryone had a smash-
ing summer? Nearly four
months of partying, doss-
ing, drunken nights, days
at work, travelling, days of
just chilling out in the sun with your
favourite beverage clutched in your
hands and the radio/music on full
blast, the list goes on. Now it’s time for
a new term, new faces, the same old
routines returning with a loud HELLO
and last but not least, time to check out
new bands and new music. Well, that is
what I am here for, so if you have any
queries or thoughts about Music felix,
feel free to email us (meaning the team,
comprisingofme,PeterandJames,who
is a new addition to the felix team) and
we’ll try to get them answered a.s.a.p.
provided that it’s something relevant
as we are busybodies with a lot on our
hands... Much appreciated.
This summer, I ventured out to the V
Festival in Weston Park, Staffordshire,
which is incidentally an hours drive
from where I live, so I guess it was only
a small trek down the road. The line-
up for this massive shebang was defi-
nitely something. I was enlightened by
countless big guns like Muse, Stereo-
phonics, The Verve and Kings of Leon,
just to name a few. Other headliners
included the Kaiser Chiefs, The Prod-
igy and The Chemical Brothers. There
were also gazillions of smaller names
such as Girls Aloud, Newton Faulkner,
Scouting for Girls, The Feeling, Amy
Winehouse (who actually turned up,
surprise, shock, horror, not only this,
she wasn’t entirely pissed off her face
or drugged up, if her demeanour and
performance were anything to go by,
but still did not perform half as well as
she is capable of, what a waste of talent
I say), and Duffy that were part of the
golden bill. This eclectic line-up en-
sured a well mixed crowd, something
that appeased pretty much everyone.
There may have been somewhat less
sunshine and a little more rain than we
hoped for, but the action was DAMN
good. Nothing could have clouded the
festival mood, not the flooding toi-
lets, not the nonexistent showers, not
the muddy, slippery ground that leapt
invitingly at your legs, urging you to
dive into the chocolatey ocean. Some
people, of their own accord of course,
stripped half naked and dived in hap-
pily, rolling in the mud, soaking in the
festival cheer and having a ball. What
a wonderful, hilarious sight. I have to
admit, I did give it a pass, being the
cleanliness freak that I am, but maybe
next time I’ll give it a shot, if the show-
ers turn up. Well, that is my festival
story told.
This week I’ve got an interview with
Frightened Rabbit, a band that has only
been on the circuit for a few years and
a cracking album by Vessels that could
do with a browse. Au revoir, ciao, adi-
os, auf wiedersehen, zai jian, annyong-
hi kashipshio, sayonara, pirmelenge,
bye... whatever floats your boat...
We get mountains of CDs sent
to us every week and there are
always gigs that need going
to and reviewing. If you fancy
getting some free stuff give us an

Vessels are a quintet, five lovely guys
from up North, Leeds lads they are
indeed. Having performed countless
incendiary live sets throughout the
length and breadth of the country,
these guys released their debut album
in August. They have received a fan-
tastic response, including rave reviews:
Kerrang – ‘Awe-inspiring… This is a
glorious, beautiful, unique, moving
and magnificent album, 4/5,’ NME – ‘a
quite brilliant work of art’ and the seal
of approval from BBC Introducing’s
Huw Stephens. Their music is thought
to have been shaped by a bit of eve-
rything, from electronic post rock to
indie, finally ending up with their own
cohesive yet distinctive sound. There
are undoubtedly many post rock bands
in the music industry that are essen-
tially copycats of Mogwai or Explo-
sions In The Sky, but frankly Vessels
do not fall under this category. Thank
goodness.
The sound of Vessels is colossal in
every sense. From the mixture of su-
perb, distorted and sometimes delayed
synthesised guitar sounds and irrefu-
tably awesome double drumming to
the beautifully simple piano arpeggios,
intricate glitch patterns, spellbinding
guitar riffs, it’s all delivered with im-
agination, flair and passion.
This strangely wonderful, nebulous
affair of an album storms away with
‘Altered Beast’, a timeless hypnotic
concoction of loopy guitar riffs, com-
plex bass, synthesised instrumentation
and excellent drumming that has im-
mense drive and holds the whole thing
together immaculately. One is hope-
lessly, willingly drowned in the incred-
F
rightened Rabbit are a quar-
tet indie rock band from the
far away land that is Scot-
land. The band is comprised
of the lovely brothers Scott
and Grant Hutchison, as well as Billy
Kennedy and Andy Monaghan, who
joined the crew later on down the line.
Music Felix went and had a good old
banter with the front man vocalist /
guitarist Scott...
What does the name Frightened
Rabbit encompass?
It relates to my own social foibles, a
look I had as a youngster when faced
with encounters with more confident
children. I then found out that a rab-
bit, when frightened, has about 10
times the strength of a relaxed rabbit.
Not sure how that applies to us, I just
thought it was interesting.
Do the band have some kind of
rabbit fetish?
I have no fetishes towards animals. I’d
definitely like to make that clear.
On the topic of fetishes, does any-
one have any weird and wonderful
fetishes that they’d like to enlight-
en us with?
Billy likes older women, but not to the
point of a fetish. It is more of a hobby.
I like picking scabs, Andy is into laser
war games and Grant likes drilling
holes in chairs.
Please give a brief description of
the band and what type of music
you play.
There are four of us in the band and
we make very pleasant guitar pop mu-
sic. We have one song with electronic
drums on it and a couple of songs with
the piano too.
How long have you guys been out
there making and doing music and
how did you form a band in the
first place?
About 3 years. We’ve grown in number
since I played on my own with a guitar,
adding one member each year.
How did you get signed?
We were approached by FatCat very
early on, and nothing really happened.
After 2 years of near misses with other
labels FatCat finally came back and of-
fered to sign us. We were very lucky
indeed.
When you were young, what kind
of music did you listen to?
When I was very young I would listen
to Vanilla Ice or Wet Wet Wet. Later,
I became a big fan of The Stone Roses,
Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.
What kind of childhood have you
had? Do you ever regret anything
you’ve done in your childhood?
I regret being so obedient. You can get
away with a lot as a child and I didn’t
take full advantage of that.
Do you remember any moments
from your teenage years with rel-
ish? Were any of you wild childs?
I wasn’t terribly wild. Like I said, I
didn’t take full advantage of what the
world had to offer. I think I’m better at
that now though.
Do you think the way people have
been brought up has a major influ-
ence on how their music is shaped?
If so, in what kind of ways?
Absolutely. Our parents like folk mu-
sic, and artists such as Kate Bush and
Queen and I think it has found its way
into the sound of our band now. Ok,
maybe not so much with Queen...
Who is the most arrogant one
in the band? Who is the ladies’
man?
I’m easily the most arrogant. But that’s
because I’m the best. Three of us have
girlfriends which, in a strange way,
makes us very good ladies’ men.
What about the most cheeky one?
Billy has a wide variety of shit jokes.
Does anyone in the band have bad
habits?
Every one of us. Bad habits are the
most enjoyable ones.
Are any of you political?
I usually vote, but it’s not based on a
great deal of knowledge. I don’t absorb
it all that well.
Are you inclined in favour of La-
bour, Conservative or Lib Dem?
Errr... isn’t that private. Honestly
though, I don’t really care that much.
Do you think musicians have
much say in the way society is
shaped?
They have done, and a good song can
certainly soundtrack a movement.
I don’t think that music alone can
change the world, it can only make it a
bit easier to be alive.
Name the 3 worst bands in
history.
The Twilight Sad, We Were Promised
Jetpacks, Ross Clark and The Scarfs
Go Missing.
Do you prefer playing in a smaller
more intimate gig or to a bigger
crowd?
Both have their plus points. I feel it is
easier to get away with mistakes at the
bigger shows, because if everyone is in
a tiny room listening intently, they are
going to know when you’ve fucked it
ible layers carved out of the whirlpool
of sounds that pulsates from the album,
thewholeshebangjustsortoffuelsyour
hungry adrenaline rush, simply bewil-
deringly mind-blowing, I hear myself
raving. Indeed, this scorching number
does not need words, the music speaks
for itself 200%. It just builds and builds,
it’s almost as if you are trapped on this
swing, swinging higher and higher, the
rush of wind hits your face, faster and
sharper and you feel absolute pain-free
exhilaration. It’s that good. What is re-
freshing with great albums is the fact
that you have songs that show vari-
ation, not just the same old formula
because our ears are innately attracted
to new soundscapes, something fresh,
something that rekindles our love for
The Rabbit is scared as hell indeed... frozen in the headlights... or sweetly nibbling some green munchies
up.
Describe your song writing pro-
cedure. What inspires you, where
and when do ideas pop into your
head for new songs?
I write in blocks, for example most of
the last record was written in about a
month or so. I get ideas all the time but
most of them float away into the ether.
I need to be sat down with an instru-
ment and a recording device to map
out a song. I’m inspired by my own life
I guess. It is all I know about.
Many people describe writing
songs and playing music as being
highly cathartic, a way of com-
municating your inner thoughts
and emotions, whether they are
uplifting or anxious, whatever
it may be, to be voiced through
their music. Does this ring true
for you?
I fell like my music is a good way of
framing certain parts of my life, to
call it ‘therapy’ is always a bit weird. It
can help to put a full stop on periods
of time when you sum them up over 4
and a half minutes of music.
Is there an immense sense of sat-
isfaction or even relief when you
finish writing a piece? Do you
ever get annoyed or frustrated
with yourself if things don’t go to
plan?
Sometimes it just comes out and is
done right there. Other songs take
weeks or months to get right. But
there’s no point in getting frustrated. It
is more productive to work out what’s
wrong with it and try to change that
somehow.
So how do you normally vent out
your anger/frustration or maybe
you prefer bottling it up inside?
I don’t have a great deal of anger fly-
ing around, but any energy I have is ex-
pended when we play live. It all comes
out in sweat and spit on the stage.
With the following artists, say
which one you prefer and why.
Muse or Snow Patrol?
Snow Patrol, they are convivial nice
chaps.
The Killers or U2?
U2. They’ve been brilliant for over 20
years.
Stereophonics or The White
Stripes?
The White Stripes. Monster riffs.
Madonna or Kylie?
Kylie is less nasal and irritating.
Duran Duran or Take That?
Duran Duran. They play instruments.
Blondie or The Manic Street
Preachers?
Difficult. Blondie have a better back
catalogue though.
If you won the lottery what would
you do with it?
Build a studio.
Name your top 3 inventions.
The guitar, the piano, the cassette
recorder.
Who is your favourite DJ, favour-
ite TV presenter and why?
Favourite DJ is Richard Colburn. Fa-
vourite TV presenter is Gok Wan.
Name your perfect day. Where
would it be and spent with
whom?
Spent rowing on a loch in the High-
lands with my girlfriend.
Where and when did you last
throw up?
In the studio about a year ago.
Do you think it is acceptable for
guys to wear makeup such as eye-
liner, mascara etc..?
Totally acceptable.
Do you have any groupies?
Depends what you mean. Nobody
wants to sleep with us really, but we
do have people who come to A LOT of
our shows.
What sort of clothes do you usu-
ally wear on stage? Casual stuff or
smart formal gear? What is your
favourite outfit?
I have a thing for check shirts. But re-
ally whatever we’ve got on that day is
also the stage wear.
What are your greatest musical
aspirations?
I’ll be aspiring to make the perfect al-
bum until I am dead.
What is your new single about?
It is about a trip I took to NYC to win
back a girl. It didn’t work, so I came
home and tried to work out what to
do.
Will you be touring soon?
From the start of September ‘til the
end of the year pretty much.
The Rabbit sits and waits for its long lost love back in NYC
Album Review: Sailing away with the Vessels
music. ‘White Fields and Open Devic-
es’ does this and will hit the spot, if not
the first time. These tracks have very
varied tempos and structures, some
short, some stretching out, you will be
left on tenterhooks each time a track
finishes, wondering where and when
things are going to change…
‘A hundred times in every direction’
takes a turn away from the cacophony
that was the starter track and winds
down to a slow, sweet, mellow husky
tune. This is the first time we get to
hear the bittersweet vocals in conjunc-
tion with the rasping guitar that is ever
present. And then bang, the drums
and thundering percussion crashes in
and it’s just sheer pandemonium. Then
it backs down yet again and slowly
but surely the whole soundscape gets
stretched out and the drum and bass
reclaims your ears once more.
On the other hand, ‘Trois Heures’
sees the Vessels changing tact again,
the backdrop being a desolate, gloomy,
almost threatening industrial land-
scape, filled with gliding guitar ar-
peggios, digital detritus and metallic
electronica. They have lots of tricks up
their sleeves.
‘Look at that Cloud’ is an atmospher-
ic instrumental piece that is a key track
taken from their inspiring arsenal. It
is however hauntingly fragile and the
dreamy yet achingly long synthesised
notes entrenched with pain evoke the
feeling of the engulfing loss of that
someone, clinging onto the faint trails

of bittersweet memories. There is also
a brief period where the drums an-
nounce their arrival, which is then fol-
lowed with splashes of minimal dark
electronica, hinting at the wilderness,
loneliness beyond and gradually reach-
ing a strong, avalanching crescendo at
the end.
With ‘Yuki’, the simple arpeggios
on the piano accompany the poign-
ant vocals, a velvety softness suffuses
the song, floating gently away in the
sea, peace at last. The inclusion of the
soothing melodic guitar and piano in-
terlude helps to paint a calm picture of
solitude, detachment from everything
altogether.
Other noteworthy tracks include the
awesomely-titled ‘An Idle Brain And
The Devil’s Workshop’, with its poly-
rhythm and frantic, cool guitar riff
work. This is a loud, at times dark ,am-
bient one, an aural assault, the sonic
soundscape pulls through menacingly,
a massive contrast to ‘Walking through
Walls’, that is made up of soulful vocali-
sation, forlorn guitar instrumentation
with clipped electronic beats that ties
everything together, nice and snug.
Over the course of 10 tracks, Ves-
sels demonstrate an immense array
of distinctive soundscapes that mark
this captivating debut album as being
both strikingly evocative and euphoric.
Lend your ears to this ravishing find.
