Felix judges
freshers’ week
F
reshers’ Week is finally over.
The question on everyone’s
lips, however, is: was the
week a success?
Imperial College Union
[ICU] have been claiming that the
week was a great success, with The
Mingle on the Saturday and the Fresh-
ers Ball on the Friday both selling out
to 1,200 students. The week certainly
had a lot to offer the students: on Sat-
urday night, Nick Grimshaw from
Radio 1 was entertaining the crowds
in the marquee, whilst on Sunday the
freshers were given a chance to have a
break and relax with some ice cream
and chill-out music.
Monday was the turn of Imperial’s
Big Jazz Band, again on the stage in
the marquee, whilst the crowd relaxed
around tables enjoying a fine selection
of cheeses and wine. Tuesday was the
Freshers’ Fair with the After party in
the evening. The purpose of this night
was to allow various clubs and socie-
ties to showcase their talents, which
certainly worked; given the number of
people present and the fact that nearly
£7,000 was taken behind the bar.
Wednesday was the big night for
all the sports teams, though the night
didn’t go exactly to plan. The Athlet-
ics Club Committee [ACC] had been
informed by the Union that the night
would start at 6.30 p.m, which meant
that when they arrived earlier than ex-
pected they were refused entry. This
led to many people leaving the Union
and not returning, according to some
of the club captains. To add to the
troubles of the night, the £1.50 a pint,
as advertised by The Union, failed to
materialise until just before 9 p.m.
Eventually all the problems were fixed,
and the crowds were entertained with
team karaoke and give aways, whilst
being serenaded by Me & Mr Jones i.e.
Sophie Ellis-Bextor & Richard Jones
from the feeling.
Thursday night was a cocktail and
chill-out night at the union, a calm and
relaxing night, leading up to the Fresh-
ers’ Ball on Friday. Pritchard vs Dain-
ton, MTV’s Dirty Sanchez & Wrecked
amused the crowds with their wacky
form of entertainment, which included
attaching fishing hooks to each other’s
ears and then pulling them until one
was loose, as well as piercing each oth-
er with needles and then adding lemon
juice.
Even though the line-up looked
promising and the fact that two of the
big nights were a sell-out, the question
that remains is wether or not the nights
were enjoyable for the students. Earlier
this week, felix decided to take a sur-
vey of 116 people, to ascertain wether
or not the week was a success.
The results of the survey showed
that there was a fairly even split be-
tween those students who enjoyed
the week and those who didn’t, with a
slight majority in favour of the week.
This could be explained by the fact that
roughly half of the first year students
are actually able to attend the events,
owing to the fact that the venues at the
Union have a capacity of 1,200, whilst
the total number of first year students
is close to 3,000.
When they were asked about the
cost of the tickets, it was found that
in general the cost of the tickets were
fine, except for The Freshers’ Ball,
where around 70% of the people asked
thought the tickets were too expensive
at up to £14.50.
However, despite the cost, around
60% of the students felt that Friday
night was the best night for them.
Combined with the whopping 83% of
students that said it were the people
and not the entertainments that made
their night, and the fact that 60% of
them didn’t have a favourite headline
act indicates that as long as there is
good music during Freshers’ Week, the
students will have a good time.
An argument can be made that it is
because of the acts that the nights were
a sell-out and a huge success, however
one first year student from Southwell
Halls commented that: “I didn’t really
care about the acts, it’s Freshers’ Week,
I would have gone anyway.”
As well as the questionnaire, felix
asked for an comments the students
may have had, and it was found that
the majority would have preferred a
live band instead of a live act, since it
would not have involved them being
able to see everything. This was the
main problem that students voiced
The general consensus of the Fresher
population at Imperial College sug-
gests Freshers’ Week was an immense
success. In comparison to last year,
students have commented on the
new generation of scholars as being
“tame, but more social.” A view wide-
ly agreed upon, with logical reasons
such as less vomit in the bathrooms,
and more people attending sell out
events.
The high standards achieved this
year, kicked off with The Mingle. An
event that sold out before Freshers’
even turned up to their respective
halls. With the only tickets available
for sale being supplied via halls. Even
this, if Beit Hall was any indication,
was an adventurous task, with the
tickets selling out within a few hours.
ICU’s first sell out event of the week.
As expected, new students gathered
en masse, with the all-too-familiar
“Hi, I’m BLANK” and “What A-Lev-
els did you take/Subject to you do?”
Obviously to unseasoned players of
the university game, this is one of the
very few talking points with which
one can start a converation. Respec-
tively The Mingle was a somewhat
conserved affair, with very merry
spirits amongst the crowd. Alcohol
was consumed and surprisingly con-
tained within the stomachs of most
Freshers. With commendable DJ sets
throughout the night supplying fuel
for dancing into the late hours of the
night. However for many this was
not the end, with afterparties tak-
ing place in kitchens and common
rooms. Obviously local off-licences
were ecstatic by the subtantial boost
in revenue. This notion of afterpar-
ties, and wild shenanigans continued
throughout the week, with ICU pro-
viding entertainment both good and
bad. Comments from freshers resid-
ing in Beit have mentioned nights
such as the Ice cream Sunday and
Freshers Fair after party being par-
ticular poor for new students. This is
most likely attributed to Hall events
superceding said Union occasions.
With so many unaccustomed faces
during these apprehensive times,
Freshers who attended their hall fes-
tivities thoroughly enjoyed meeting
their peers. With a noticed increase in
alcohol consumption, defensive walls
protecting people’s true personalities
crumbled. More friends were made,
corridors got to know one another
and the expected Fresher cliques
were formed. Continuing throughout
the week, amusing stories from the
last night were relived, providing bet-
ter talking points than the aformen-
tioned greetings. Argubly the least
successful night was Wednesday,
with many freshers choosing to go to
Fabric and see Dizzy Rascal instead
of the cat like Sophie Ellis-Bextor and
other half Richard Jones. Thursday
ICU wisely decided to take a break,
as Fabric hosted yet abother crazy
nights of tunes. This didn’t mean,
however, Freshers’ not going to the
mighty Fabric missed out. Many stu-
dent halls seized the moment to pro-
vide more exciting trips to the outside
world. A few of these just ended up in
complete carnage, with some Fresh-
ers’ blood alcohol content reaching
fatal limits.
The question “What could make
this week better” crossed the minds of
severely malnourished Freshers’. The
answer was Friday’s Fresher’s Ball.
Another sell out event, and according
to a recent felix survey, the most en-
joyable night for numerous Freshers.
This night contained massive lineups
form artists such as Nicky Blackmar-
ket, DJ Hype and Rusko. However the
nights main highlight were the crazy
boys from Dirty Sanchez. Perfoming
stunts such as smashing light bulbs
on their backs, abusing their bodies
with sparks from an angle grinder.
Students felt the show was sick and
awesome.
On the whole, This years Fresh-
ers’ Week was both a success to the
Union and the Freshers’. The only
negative comments being the high
admission price for the events. An
example being the ejoyable Freshers’
Ball, robbing poor student of £14.50.
Evidently various halls saw this as be-
ing too harsh on the student pocket,
and in some Halls the tickets were
subsidised to £10.

about Friday night, as it was proving
difficult to see the Dirty Sanchez act
since the stage was too low. Concern
were also raised as to the capacity of
the venue, as a lot of the students were
unable to attend, with several students
commenting that the Union should
probably try and find an external venue
that can hold all the students.
Another surprising result was that
the second favourite night was the Af-
ter party on the Tuesday, with the main
comment being that the live music
made it enjoyable for them. This can
be viewed as a massive success for the
various clubs and societies that took
part in the show.
In conclusion, the survey did provide
a valuable insight into the general opin-
ion of Freshers’ Week, with the main
findings being that Friday night was
too expensive, and that the students
would prefer live band rather than a
live act, which coincides with the com-
ments made about Tuesday night. In
terms of satisfaction, the consensus of
the survey seemed to have been that as
long as good music is played, the week
will be a success, regardless. However,
others have argued that the true suc-
cess of Freshers’ Week will be seen by
how many of the students will be re-
tained by the various clubs and socie-
ties in the coming weeks.
