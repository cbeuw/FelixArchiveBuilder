Mens elite conquer chavs
This match report starts midway
through the first half when IC Men’s 1st
XI were two goals to nil down. IC had
decided that Essex had enough goals
and should now be put into their place
- the whipping boys of the league!
After some tactical adjustments and
encouragements from Lord Byron,
IC quickly struck back with two goals
from Stumpy and Sash. Sexy Sash (as
he is more well known) continued to
interlink with fresher Koch culminat-
ing in some elegant moves. Half time
arrived and it was all level at two a
piece, where Lord Byron delivered
his commandments. The second half
kicked off with fresher Prior opening
the floodgates for IC. Whatever captain
DR put in the jaffa-cakes at half time
clearly worked with goals from Diana
effectively wrapping up the win inside
the first ten minutes. It was at this time
Lord Byron unleashed Sid and Paedo
from the bench... Stumpy had other
ideas however! Being a bit of an Essex
boy himself he decided to take pity on
the opposition and proceeded to miss
two open goals. Diana was less forgiv-
ing and completed his hat-trick. Eleven
goals in a row had secured victory for
IC, although in the bar afterwards Es-
sex demolished ET et al. in a poorly
run boat race. IC look forward to next
weeks match against Caterbury Christ
Church, a potential league decider!
Badminton
Bonanza!

Hello again. The surprisingly long word
list of last week’s crossword meant that
I didn’t get a chance to plug the inter-
active online crosswords again.
I will do so now. www.crossword.
info/Enoch should provide you with
said interactive versions of all of this
year’s puzzles.
This week’s offering may be a little
easier than the previous two; entirely a
case of setters’ block that I’m going to
pass off as an act of kindess.
Enjoy!

Medic first blood
The last match the Medic 3s had played
together was a massive victory over IC
in varsity, however it was the 2nd team
they faced in the first game of the new
season. This fixture has been incred-
ibly close for the last three seasons
with IC edging it every time so both
sides were fired up for a great start to
the season.
There was no departure from the
expectation in the first quarter, the
match being closely fought with end
to end with episodes of good play. De-
spite IC leading 3-1, by the end of the
quarter the medics had managed to
claw it back to go ahead 4-3.
In the second quarter the medics
found their stride and comfortably ex-

tended their lead. The impenetrable
defence of GK Colleen McGregor and
the partnership between Kate Wood-
ing and Emma Suttill at the other end
frustrated IC and kept the goals com-
ing. Half time came at a low point with
an IC injury, but the score 9-6 to the
medics.
Fatigue was evident in both teams in
the second half but the medics capital-
ised on the strength in depth of their
new squad to continue fighting and
stretched their lead to 8 goals with only
a quarter remaining. In the last ten
minutes, under the threat of the flood-
lights being turned off, IC led a spirited
resurgence, leaving the score 15-10 to
the medics at the final whistle.
Credit goes to both teams for excel-
lent play with the ULU season coming
so soon after the start of term. Fresh-
ers Sarah Hancox and Feroza Kassam
played particularly well in their first
match for and the rest of the club are
looking forward to celebrating a clean
sweep of first game victories with them
in the Reynolds on Wednesday night!
On a wet and windy day at home ICUR-
FC 2nd’s played their first match of the
season against St Barts 1st’s (Medic
Scum). The first ten minutes was all IC
with our forwards working it tight with
their muster and the backs hitting their
lines when they had the ball. All the
scum could do was watch and stare,
and drop the ball every 5 seconds. This
pressure led IC to gain a penalty inside
the 22, which Scott Greening convert-
ed to give IC an early lead. James Mor-
rison left the pitch at this point com-
plaining it was too tough at prop and
was replaced by Andy Dolan.
The scum started bossing the scrum
as the ref was blind to their cheating
on the front and they worked their one
ICURFC take on medic scum
move of giving it to the fatter mem-
bers to bosh it forward. But IC stayed
strong. After about fifteen minutes of
sustained pressure on our own line,
and some gentle shoeing by Fresher
Dave and Niall, the scum crashed over
for their first unconverted try.
Then came the move of the match.
After a long clearance by Scott in which
the scum’s full back failed to catch and
knocked out for a line out, Scott had
the presence of mind and knowledge of
the new rules to take a quick line out
to Fresher Dave, get the ball back and
score our first try of the season. The
scum scored again to leave the rain
soaked matched locked at 8-10.
IC started the second half with
Fresher Rob nailing their fullback as he
was kicking for touch. The full-blood-
ed tackles kept flying from every mem-
ber of the team. Five minutes into the
second half our replacements came on
and after two minuets and one tackle
Fresher Simon left after his cameo.
After IC defend their line with mas-
sive hits we caught them on the break.
With a kick through, Scott, Fresher
Dave and Fresher Ginger-guy chased
down the scum’s full back and true to
form he fucked up again which lead to
Scott crashing over.
IC then had to defend their line with
the score at 13-10 and held strong for
20 minutes. Unfortunately the scum
crashed over to go up 15-13. After this
Joe Mac got cramp and screamed like
a little girl so the final fresher came
on. In the last fifteen minutes IC kept
turning the ball over but couldn’t find a
way through with Scott missing a pen-
alty near the end of the match.
IC 2nd’s can be proud seeing that the
previous week the scum had won 69-0
and we are confident that we can hold
our own in this league. Andy Mac had
a great first match in charge with the
support of Malcolm. There also great
performances from the freshers who
were all over the pitch giving their all.
Men of the Match went to Scott and
Fresher Ben. Twat of the Match had to
go to Fresher Simon for his two minute
cameo.

The match got off to a controversial
start with the captains unable to agree
upon which weapon to fence first. UCL
were keen to get under way with epee,
to allow one of their fencers to attend
afternoon lectures while Imperial’s key
epeeist Sjoerd Miedema was stuck in
traffic. Imperial received a lucky break
as first Sabre, then Epee and finally Foil
were randomly drawn.
Charlie Hennings made his experi-
ence count in the opening match, ef-
fortlessly dispatching his opponent
5-2. Team captain Maurice Berk sub-
sequently found himself on the very
wrong end of a 4-8 loss and Impe-
rial continued to drop points as Chris
Namih lost his first match 3-5. Matters
continued to worsen as Maurice failed
to redeem himself in his second match,
losing 3-5 before Charlie romped to a
10-2 victory. Chris went close with a
5-6 loss in his second match to leave
the score 30-28 in Imperial’s favour
before the final round. Maurice final-
ly found his stride with a 5-3 victory,
quickly followed by Chris’s 5-4 win.
Charlie brushed aside his final oppo-
nent 5-2, leaving Imperial 45-37 in the
lead going in to epee.
Sjoerd Miedema, was nominated an-
chor for epee and despite reportedly
suffering from tuberculosis, produced
a fine 5-3 win in his opening match.
Fresher Chris Jackson also produced
an excellent debut display to win his
Fencers On Target
Maurice Berk
first match 5-2 before Tim Harford-
Cross made it 3 out of 3 with a 5-3
victory. Chris could only manage a 5-5
draw in his second match and Sjoerd
fared no better, going down to a 5-8
defeat, a sure sign of the disease rav-
aging his body. Tim got Imperial back
to winning ways with a 5-4 win but the
elation was short lived as UCL surged
to the finish in the final three matches,
winning 4-10, 3-5 and 3-5. This left
UCL with a close fought victory in
epee, final scores standing at 40-45 and
leaving Imperial with a slender 3 point
lead with just foil to play for.
Club president Chris Namih, clearly
back in his element after his rare foray
in to sabre, stormed to a 5-1 victory in
the opening foil match. Nathan “Badg-
er” Harmston experienced a mauling
by UCL’s captain, limping his way to a
5-8 defeat and setting the nerves rac-
ing. Fortunately 2nd team veteran Alex
Bishop restored faith with a solid 5-2
win before Badger made amends, win-
ning his second match 5-4. Chris con-
tinued to run rampant, demolishing
his second opponent 5-1 before it was
Alex’s turn to find himself on the end
of a brutal battering courtesy of UCL’s
captain, eventually finding his way to
a 5 – 11 defeat. Badger, clearly feeling
the effects of physical exertion, made
way for substitute and omnipresent
2nd team fixture Nathan Blundell who
made a strong case for a place in the
starting lineup for the next match with
a 5-0 win. Alex continued to struggle
against his final opponent, losing 5-9
and leaving the scores 125-117 in Im-
perial’s favor before the final match.
With a potential 10 points up for grabs
for UCL, Chris needed to ensure he
made the most of his years of fencing
experience to prevent the UCL captain
from almost single-handedly winning
them the match. Chris overcame his
opponent 5-3 in a fine display that fi-
nally settled Imperial’s nerves, final
score standing at 130 – 120.
Wednesday night sees the start of
baseball’s 104th World Series, a best-
of-seven playoff that will pit the win-
ner of the American League Champi-
onship Series, currently taking place
between the Tampa Bay Rays and Bos-
ton Red Sox, against the winner of the
National League Championship Series,
featuring the Philadelphia Phillies and
Los Angeles Dodgers. But how does an
event between members of these two
American leagues justify crowning a
world champion?
Today professional leagues exist
throughout SE Asia and Latin Ameri-
ca. In 2006 the inaugural World Clas-
sic was held; the 16-nation event was
won by Japan, with the USA being
knocked out in the second round. Yet
MLB remains the pinnacle of the sport,
attracting all the world’s best players.
After impressing at the World Clas-
sic, Japanese pitcher Daisuke Matsu-
zaka’s decision to come to MLB led to
the Red Sox bidding $51.1 million just
for the rights to negotiate with him
(he eventually signed a contract worth
up to $60 million over 6 years). This
year’s playoffs have seen many nations
top stars on display including Canadi-
ans Russell Martin and Jason Bay and
Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz of
the Dominican Republic to name but
a few. In all the 2008 season featured
players from nearly 20 countries with
around 30% born outside of America
and the Toronto Blue Jays franchise
being based in Canada.
Unless a league that rivals the talent
and ethnic diversity found in MLB is
established the Series’ champions can
still feel justified in calling themselves
the World Champions.
