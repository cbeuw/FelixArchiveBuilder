Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition - 3
Ravi Pall
Coffee Break Editor
W
ell what can I say
guys. Another
week, another
chance to enter the
photoshop compe-
tition. Remember, you could win an
iPod. A real one. I promise it’ll even be
new.
Also, how awesome was the Freshers’
Ball on Friday? That was a rhetorical
question. It was immense. The Dirty
Sanchez boys both digust and amuse
me. All that matters is that Dainton
gave me his blood-stained T-Shirt.
Blood + T-shirt = Awesome
Yeah, that’s right. It also made me
happy to see the ever-so-lovely Jager
Girls. Although I was scared by the
podgy one who looked like it took a tub
of lard to squeeze her into her dress.
Like I cared though. Jagermeister is by
far my favourite drink. Sure it tastes
like cough syrup that has been left
open for a year, but mix that with the
genius of redbull and you don’t even
know it’s there.
In other news, the new MacBooks
have come out. Now I don’t count my-
self as a hardcore apple fan boy, but
damn do they look sweet. Somebody
hook me up with one, I’m poor. I know
some of you will say ‘tough, I don’t get
one for free either.’ However, have you
people thought about the fact that I
look like a pirate? No, thought not.
That is all.
Also lectures started this week, prob-
ably earlier for some of you. I have three
recommendations. The first is to bring
your pillow to your lectures. Seriously;
those desks are hard. A Pillow makes
that mid day nap all the better. Second
is avoid all 9 o’clock lectures. Don’t be
the chump everyone copies the notes
from because you turned up. Be the
guy/girl who copies of the chump that
did. No offense to Chumps, I’m jealous
you’re going to get a first. Lastly, Bring
a hipflask full of hard liquor. If you have
to go you may as well be drunk.
Back to more Coffee Break stuff,
Sikh MC didn’t make it this week.
Long story short, we in the felix office
thought that Snaky B dressed as Dizzy
Rascal was way better. We were right.
Our man Marc Kerstein is hooking us
up with all sorts to give away with the
iPod- or so I heard. He better, he’s the
Apple campus rep for Imperial College.
He’ll hook you guys up with whatever
you need (to do with Apple. He’s not a
drug dealer).
4. Relentless:
If there is one thing Imperial Col-
lege Students like, it’s anything that’ll
keep you awake during the day, dur-
ing the night and during you exams.
Now Pro Plus is the usual option, or
Redbull. But both fail in comparison
to Relentless. I’ve seen rhinos have
heart attacks on this stuff.
I won’t lie to you, I drink at least one
can a day. This stuff packs a punch,
and at 230 Kcal per can it’s hard core.
Hell, even David Cameron used it to
tell the Labour party to “Wake up!”
Best thing is, unlike Redbull, it comes
in 3 flavours. Normal, Orange, and
Juice. All three taste exactly the same
though, suggesting that there is just
way too much sugar. Reminds me
of Powerthirst (youtube it). It even
makes me wonder whether it can be
legal.
Like Jagermeister? Try Jager bombs
with relentless. If that doesn’t send
you to the moon, I don’t know what
will. Well, a space shuttle perhaps.

This weeks winner. Team Vader. Next weeks RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulations to this week’s win-
ner, Team Vader. We’ll be honest
when we say they won only because
of their immature, yet hilarious re-
iteration of the CGCU url. Also the
words “EPIC FAIL.” Just so you guys
know, they put Darth Vader in their
entry last week as well. It’s like some
kind of gimmick. Also many chuck-
les were made at the inclusion of
Kirby. Someone is obviously a fan of
hangman.
Drink with me, I’m Snaky B
and this week I’m dressed as DZ
This week’s image is of Dainton and
Pritchard from Drity Sanchez. Yes that
is his manhood between the fretboard
and guitar string.
Ouch!

Email your entry to coffee.felix@
imperial.ac.uk with your team name
with your photo and you’ll be entered
into the FUCWIT league.
O
i!!! What up my breth-
ren? I’ve got to chat
to you, I’ve got some-
thing to tell all you
pussy’oles.
You’ve got fix up, there’s a lot of nasty
bros walking around and you know it’s
time they try and look sharp. It ain’t
about getting attention, mate being
a celebrity don’t mean shit to me, it’s
all about self-respect. It’s about get-
ting your backs up, backs up, back off
the wall and making sure you stand up
tall.
You’ll never know if you just walk
past, you better just ask. That’s some
wisdom man. Remember it. You got to
take it further than the dance floor. Ya
understand my man? If you need some
fun, just glance at me and we’ll party
cool? We’ll kick it old school! You get
me? Blud you’re not wrong if you think
I want to get involved..
Anyway enough of the guys. I want
to let all the ladies know that I want to
get behind your backbone. Snaky B,
I’m good to go blud, because they don’t
know I’m keepin it gansta. Who’d up in
the end flow, keepin it tight?
kthnxbye!
More sugar than you need. Yes!
If anything in this or its associate
sections offend you in any way,
please bear in mind I’m not
responsible for the Hangman
team. Those guys are crazy and
as a result don’t blame me.
Virgo
This week you’ll
meet Aaron Berk,
a second year. He
can’t speak to you
though. Tragically
he was deer shanked
in the ass, had his member filed away by a
cheese grater and sentenced to euthanasia
the old-fashioned way. Thats right, being
torn apart by 4 rampantly horny horses is
cool again. I would like to thank Aaron for his
effort to bring me back.
Scorpio
This week Felix is
really depressed.
There is so much
stupid, inane crap
being thrown
around and I really
just want to smile. I don’t even have the
enthusiasm or life-in-me to go to Cheapskates
with a school friend. Do you see what you’ve
fucking done? I hate you all, I really really hate
you.
Libra
This week you find
yourself a familar
place, a lecture
theatre. Wow this is
boring, how can you
make it interesting?
I would suggest, as a man of the cloth, that you
take a piece of rope, wrap it around the neck
of the person next to you and scream “DIE
BITCH” until they tell you WHAT THE FUCK
THE LECTURER IS TALKING ABOUT
Sagittarius
This week you left
your blue shirt at a
friend’s house. They
were kind enough
to wash it, dry it,
iron it and fold it;
presenting it to you with a pillow on top. How-
ever you find out that they used slave child
labour and the blood of a thousand puppys as
detergent. You have a new found respect for
your buddy and you buy him a cake in thanks,
unethical dead baby cake of course.
Capricorn
This week you
experiment in bed.
Your undeservedly
better half begins
to tie you up. Once
bound and gagged
she begins to pour hot wax over you, laughing
as you scream in pain. God won’t help you, he
doesn’t believe in sex before marriage. Why do
you think all women are married to god at the
same time as their husband?
Cancer
This week you
went to Fabric
for the very first
time in your life. It
was a memorable
experience
but something was lacking, something
very important. Oh yes, I wasn’t wearing
underwear. As my groin sweat rubbed onto
my tight skinny jeans I felt the comforting
sensation of an older man groping my testicles.
Gemini
This week a student
complains about the
Hangman section.
Unfortunately, he
chooses to come
into the office at an
inopportune moment, when the Editors just
happen to be polishing their deer shivs. His
obituary reads “That damn bitch got what
he fucking deserved. Love Mum”. Few people
attend his funeral, even fewer people wank on
his grave. Well just one person. Me.
Leo
This week you
realise that working
behind the bar in
the Union isn’t all
that it’s cracked up
to be. In fact there
isn’t any crack at all. You spend 6 miserable
hours completely sober before you lose control
and punch the next person who asks you to
top up their fucking pint. I swear, I will fucking
KILL the next cunt-stain who asks,
Taurus
This week you
are a right-wing
conservative. You
have abandoned all
your free-market
principles and cling
desperately to the lifejacket of government
intervention. Most of you can’t even jump out
of your office windows because you have been
fired and security have strict orders to beat
you up on sight. You have failed.
Aries
At some point this
week you’ll wake up
and look at yourself
in the mirror.
Disgusting. You’re
too much of a pussy
to top yourself off so you make yourself smile...
joker style. Unsurprsingly your smile doesn’t
impress the ladies (scarred freak). Looks like
nothing’s changed for you then. Well I say
nothing, the rape you’ll suffer may be a new.
Pisces
This week a Felix
Editor says that
Enoch’s crosswords
are lame. Enoch
seizes a nearby
sword and through
gritted teeth exclaims “If you EVER say that
again, I will destroy YOU”. He then returns
to his corner in the Felix office and grumbles
about “those kids”. The offending Felix Editor
then buys a bottle of whisky and does an
explicit parody of “Girls Gone Wild”. Sweet.
Horrorscopes: get ready to be fucked over... HARD
Aquarius
This week it’s
certain that you’ll
have sex. Probably
for the first time.
Definitely with that
girl you met while in
hospital. You know the one paralysed from the
eyeballs down, blind, deaf, dumb. Oh yeah jizz
into those bedsores. Do it. It could be worse,
she could have AIDS as well. Save that girl for
next week. Buckaroo anyone?

“Please feed the cat. I don’t want
felix it to go to kitty hell.

appealing if I were naked more
often”

Back by popular demand. The sick bastard from the first issue. You asked for it.
Dear Tamara,
I’m a fresher, staying in halls, and al-
though I came to university in a loving
and committed relationship, my other
half is hundreds of miles away and I
keep having slightly drunken hanky-
panky with a girl in halls. I feel really
bad afterwards, but at the time my
brain isn’t the one doing the thinking.
What should I do?
Frustrated Fresher,
Cold shower in Princes Gardens
Dear Frustrated Fresher,
In these situations, I like to adopt the
what-he/she-doesn’t-know-can’t-hurt-
him/her attitude. Realistically, she’s
probably doing the same thing anyway,
no matter how soppy her emails are. In
fact the soppier the guilt-ier as far as
I’m concerned!
Try to look on the bright side; at
least you got an Imperial girl to look
at you, imagine how the guys with
no girls are feeling! My advice to you
is to keep both on the go. Eventually
timetable clashes may arise, and some
plate-throwing rows may be inevitable,
but you can worry about that when the
time comes.
Dear Tamara,
I don’t quite know what’s going on, last
week I woke up in a basement in Beit
– I don’t even live in Beit! Thankfully I
still had my trousers, but was missing
my shirt, glasses and shoes. The place
was a complete tip, like someone had
just turned it upside down. After find-
ing my possessions in various places
around the union, I carried on as nor-
mal. However, I keep finding strangers
talking to me like they know me and we
shared some hilarious experience, or
some people just laugh as I pass them
in the corridor.
All I really remember of the night be-
fore is the guys buying me drinks! I’m so
confused, what’s going on?
Confused, In the dark
Dear Confused,
I can really sympathise with your situ-
ation. To me the success of a night out
is measured by the number of free
drinks I have received from potential
sugar daddies. The best thing to do is
to adopt a nonchalant attitude and pre-
tend like you know exactly what hap-
pened that night, you’re just too cool to
care. People will see that you don’t care
and will copy you. Of course, for this
to work, you must be cool enough for
people to want to copy you…
Dear Tamara,
I really want to have sex with my boy-
friend but I am afraid he’ll think I look
horrible naked because I’m really thin
with tiny boobs. What should I do?
Stick Insect
Dear Stick Insect,
The man should (and will) be grateful
that you’re agreeing to sleep with him
in the first place. He’ll be far too des-
perate to get your clothes off to really
notice what’s underneath. If you were a
bit of a chubster, you would worry that
the man will think you are too wobbly.
So just chill out and look at him criti-
cally instead – he is the one who should
worry about pleasing you. Alternative-
ly, use your loan to get some help of the
silicone variety. It’s like the underwear
dilemma - girls worry about what they
wear but if you ask most men, under-
wear is just a hindrance to their pursuit
of what is underneath.
Tamara says: “Kill two birds with one cock!”
