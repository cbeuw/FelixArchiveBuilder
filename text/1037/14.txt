L
ong before Neil Armstrong made
"..one giant leap for mankind" in
the summer of 1969, the idea of
space travel had captivated
mankind's imagination. Indeed, as
Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek
put it, space was "Hie Final Frontier."
T o S e e k O u t
N e w E x h i b i t s . . .
The Science Museum is currently paying
tribute to Roddenberry's vision of the future.
With an exhibition dedicated to Star Trek, the
cult series of the 60's and beyond, they are
inviting visitors to "boldly go" where few others
have gone before.
This is the first time Star Trek material has
been displayed outside of the U.S.A. and there
is plenty to see. The exhibition comprises
costumes, models and masks from the original
series and its spin-
offs. Among the
costumes are the
starfleet duty
uniforms as worn
by the cast. There
are also models of
the various ships,
communicating
devices, tricorders,
phasers and
Klingon knives,
displayed behind
glass for the safety
of the 20th century visitors. Perhaps the most
impressive exhibit is the full-size bridge of the
U.S.S. Enterprise, but unfortunately the prime
seat is reserved for Captain Kirk only.
There are short videos to watch, dedicated
to each series, namely Star Trek, Next
Generation and Deep Space 9. However, the
Voyager appears to be experiencing some
technical difficulties with its transporter, as no
exhibits have beamed down from the latest
Star Trek Starship.

a n d N a o m i N o r m a n
Throughout the exhibition there are
comparisons made between the ideas and
concepts used in Star Trek and the way
modem technology has mirrored them. It also
becomes apparent that Star Trek was
pioneering in the way that it addressed the
social issues of the time.
Gabriel Allen, one of the staff and occasional
acting captain said that the exhibition is "Not
necessarily aimed at Trekkies," but was staged
to prompt, "Greater understanding of science
and technology."
Visitors to the exhibition expressed their
surprise at the simplicity of the costumes and
the relatively small size of the bridge.

appeared to
emerge from
the exhibition
having enjoyed
it. For die hard
Trekkies there
is an oppor-
tunity to
purchase all
manner of
memorabilia,
ranging from
videos to models, and more unusually ties,
phonecards and actual outfits. For those
interested in the stars, Mr. Sulu, alias George
Takei, and Mr. Spock, alias Leonard Nimoy
will be beaming down to the Science Museum
in the near future (dates yet to be confirmed).
The exhibition runs until 25th February
1996 and entrance, free to students of Imperial
College, is via a ticket which reads "admit
humans only"!

# Astrologer Patric Walker died last week at
the age of 64. His column, which appeared in
The Evening Standard and The Mail on
Sunday, was syndicated all over the world and
had more than a billion readers. However,
unlike astrologers who claim their work to be
scientific, Walker saw himself more as a
therapist than a scientist.
#NASA recently waved goodbye to Pioneer
11, the first probe to visit Saturn. On its epic
22 year voyage the craft also had to brave the
asteroid belt of Jupiter. Sadly though, Pioneer
11 is now further from the sun than Pluto and
is doomed to drift through space with a failing
power supply.
#The European Space Agency has had to
delay further the launch of the giant rocket
launcher Ariane V until April, 1996. The
postponement was attributed to leaky oxygen
and hydrogen fuel circuits, an engine problem
and faulty equipment at the launch site!!!!
