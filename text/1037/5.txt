First amongst equals?
It would not be presumptuous
to suggest that amongst the
many factors considered by a
sixth former in choosing a
University the most impor-
tant is the academic strength
of relative institutions.
How would such decisions
be made though if all
institutions were equal?
No this isn't a hypothetical
question on a Marxist sociology
paper but an idea that is
currently being given serious
consideration by the
Committee of Vice
Chancellor's and Principal's
(CVCP). Not content with
assisting the Government in
shepherding reluctant under-
achieves into institutions of
dubious quality, they now
apparently believe that many
universities enjoy unfair
advantage over others because
of unavailing considerations
such as location, extra
curricular opportunities and
social life. Instead, the C V C P
argue prospective student's
should only base decisions on
quality - levelling the playing
field means sixth formers will
make more reasoned decisions.
Moreover, institutions which
currently codify the
educational underclass will
enjoy a greater slice of the very
limited cash cake.
Are all universities
equal? The CVCP likes
to think so, as Nooman
Haque explains.
Maintaining standards
requires recruiting and keeping
the best staff and ensuring all
important research facilities are
modern accessible and
available. To equalise equality
therefore would require a
redistribution of these
resources through legislation.
One may laugh at images of
removal men wheeling away
expensive PET scanning
equipment from Cambridge to
the Luton College of further
and continuing adult education
(established as a university in
1994, of course), where
presumably bright student's
who are naturally attracted by
glass, concrete and a student
union housed in a Portacabin,
would relish in the new
Utopian education system. It
may bring a chuckle to read the
oratorical EC-like directive
which would banish all
irrelevant factors from the
decision making process.
However the architects of
this ambitious plan have
displayed deeply flawed logic
and an inability to appreciate
what university life is all about.
That is not funny.
There are implications here
for university funding. If the
next government introduces
either a loan system to cover
maintenance or a top up loan to
cover fees, then student's will
demand value. The quality an
individual enjoys is embedded
in the overall quality of the
physical environment of the
institution. The existence of
skill enhancement and pure
enjoyment through extra
curricular activity is central to
the lives of many students.
A culture of enforced
egalitarianism removes
aspiration and achievement and
thus harms standards sending
them spiralling downwards. It
is by any definition a Marxist
solution and will promote
conflict between the
institutions and the C V C P
which will be deleterious to
campus life.
University should not only
be a time for gaining formal
qualifications, but in addition a
time for self reflection and
professional development.
Such immeasurable benefits
are dependent on stimulating
and free learning environments
which will always differ from
one university to another. The
failure of the C V C P to realise
this merely underlines their
detachment from the real
world and strengthens the
argument for reform in their
ranks.
