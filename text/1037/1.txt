H R H the Princess Anne, Chancellor of the University of London, visited the Electrical Engineering
department on Monday to open a new analogue laboratory, funded by the Thai Mahanakorn University of
Technology. During the visit she met the winners of a first year Microlab Poster Competition. Dr Eric
