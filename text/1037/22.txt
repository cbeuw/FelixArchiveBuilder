Dear Felix,
I am extremely sad that fel-
low students regard members of
Imperial's Conservative Society
as having "inherent prejudices".
Nothing could be further from
the truth! Our range of political
opinions are voiced at our many
debates! You will rarely find two
of our members agreeing on all
issues!
We do not toe the Party line
in all cases, and have fundamental
disagreements with some poli-
cies. The society is a hot-bed of
political activity and Ian Bayley
does not reflect the opinions of
every member! In committee we
often say you are wrong and tell
him why. The events over the last
few weeks have certainly shown
that Consoc is now open for
business!
Geoff Boon
What a relief for everyone.
Dear Felix,
I must respond to Mr.
"Name retained. Exactly" of
Felix 1036 who called my "reac-
tionary" despite agreeing with my
W W W article about Rupert
Murdoch. Most people who have
actually read my article would
see Felix's column-filler as "melo-
dramatic" and my article was no
more "defamatory" or "libellous"
than anything (s)he (the letter
writer) has written about me.
I have in fact consulted a P G
law student friend of mine from
City University about my article
and he has assured me that there
is no possibility of legal action.
Nor will I C U withdraw my arti-
cle from our Web site since it at
least is "politically neutral".
If my society is to be the
only forum for political debate I
can live with it. That is one of the
important roles that political par-
ties play. It is for Felix to decide
whether it wants to provide the
forum that so many IC students
need. M y experience is that it
doesn't want to. Felix made no
attempt to cover the issues of the
N U S campaign last year and con-
cerned itself only with campaign
funding and with guessing the
outcome. Lunchtime debates
were the medium of discussion,
not Felix, and so it continues wih
our society.
I wrote my reply to Felix
because I always respond when
my society is wrongly attacked. It
was Felix that was responsible for
putting me in that position and it
is you, Mr. "Name retained" that
is responsible for this reply if you
really think that it counts as
"publicity". I hope this will be an
end to the matter and that I
won't need to clarify the obvious
again.
Ian Bayley
Conservative Chairman
A small point: IC Union set
up pro- and anti-NUS campaign
groups in order to give the voters
the information they would
need. All IC media (including
Felix) were required to be impar-
tial on the NUS debate, and thus
could not run commentary
which might be construed as
attempting to influence the out-
come of the referendum.
By the way, congratulations
on your promotion from a hum-
ble student society to
Westminster party politics....
E n t s r e p e n t s
Dear Felix,
Having read your editorial
last week about Ents, its music
policy and people's views about it
(including mine!), I hope I can
answer some of the valid points
raised.
Firstly, the music. Obviously
this is all a matter of personal
taste, but I have to agree that in
the past we haven't exactly acco-
modated a huge variety of tastes,
and I'm sure I'm not the only one
who quickly loses interest in
repetitive 4/4 beats. So, to try
and balance that this year we've
changed our approach to Friday
nights, by putting on "specialist"
nights to cover those areas we
may have previously neglected,
such as indie, funk, soul and hip-
hop, and mainstream student
"classics". The hope is that these
will attract the people who nor-
mally dismiss the music as
"crap". (Dates are on the year-
planner, and will be advertised
well in advance.)
Secondly, it's easy to com-
plain, but not make a contribu-
tion. The choice of music may
not appeal, but to a certain
extent, that's as much a fault of
the people who aren't involved as
it is down to the DJs.
Unfortunately, if that's how you
want to see it, most of the cur-
rent Ents DJs want to play dance
music - which makes it hard to
play a huge variety of music. So,
if you're a fan of music that does-
n't get played too much, why not
come to an Ents meeting at lpm
on a Tuesday in the Union Office
and have your say?
Obviously, I want the events
we stage within our limited bud-
get to appeal to as many people
as possible - not just a minority
who argue about BPMs and
remixes. Also, I'd like people to
come to the Union for "events"
not just for a bar extension. Not
everyone may like what we do,
but at least we are trying to do
something - can everyone who
complains say the same ?
Finally to anyone who does
genuinely assess the value of the
Union on an individual DJ's
musical taste, can I suggest that
they open their eyes and see the
really important things the Union
does, but never gets credit for?
Cheers for letting me have a
say.
Mark.
Events & Marketing Manager.
You're welcome, Mark. But
let me get this straight - inces-
sant dance every Wednesday
(which is free), and every other
kind of music on Friday nights
(which, presumably, we'd have
to pay for)? Does this really
redress the balance?
At risk of being one of the
do-nothing complainers, I'd
rather see themed evenings both
days. (Besides, there's no-one in
the Felix office on Friday nights
anyway...)
Dear Editor,
Having read your editorial in
last weeks Felix, I would like to
point out a few things, as I get
the impression you don't exactly
know what you're talking about.
With the massive variety of
people at Imperial comes a mas-
sive variety of musical taste
(unfortunately). However, on an
average Wednesday night, a lot of
the people who come and dance
in the Ents lounge are pissed-up
members of the various sports
clubs around college, and all most
of them want to hear is "the tack-
iest of dance music" and we
always get people asking for
Parklife. I would like to know if
you have any ideas as to what
type of music we could play to
please everybody. When we are
DJing we receive requests for
every type of music you could
imagine, and then some more,
and there is no way we can play
all of them. I cannot, and will not
speak for the other DJs, but I will
try and play to the crowd, if
someone requests a song, I will
play it if I think the rest of the
people will like it. Quite often I
will not play it, because every-
body except the person who
asked for it will very probably go
to the bar and not come back.
The amount of abuse we receive
for not playing Oasis, for exam-
ple, when everybody is dancing
away (quite happily) to "dance
music" you would not believe.
I've had the needle taken off the
record I've been playing, been
spat at, people have bared their
