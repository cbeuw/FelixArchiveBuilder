h o c k e y
Ladies Hockey 1st XI
stunned the world with a win
over UCL, and just to celebrate
they wrote a poem:
"Last week we was robbed
This week we stole
The opposition were good
But we still scored a goal
The first half was dull
So not much to say
The next one was great
And we blew them away"
Lovely.

RSM 1 STS: The first game of the
season for the RSMAFC, and
the expected messy and disjoint-
ed team didn't disappoint after
all. Things came together in the
second half, thanks to some
sound defence by Freddy and
positive forward play from the
twin brothers Karsten and
Cantona-contemporary Michelle.
Both goals came from Digger,
and apologies are extended to
Pauli for a smart kick in the
head and 5+ stitches
IC WOMEN'S ISTS: The football
season got off to a great start for
IC's womens teams. The level of
play was high, though our navi-
gational skills were somewhat
lower. After misreading platform
numbers at Waterloo, changing
into kit at Surbiton High Street,
and running to meet our opposi-
tion in Cobham; we were all
exhausted
Yet this was not not at all
reflected in play.
Our first goal was scored by
Christine within seconds of the
first whistle. Not five minutes
later, our dynamic striker
Kendra booted a beautifull ball
into the back of the net. After
half-time the score was doubled
when centre-back Steph got
bored and decided to run past
StGeorge's "Diabolical Defence"
and score for fun; this was fol-
lowed by a further goal from
Kendra.
UCL were shocked to find
our new Norweigan weapon and
American Ace who between
them scored four goals. The
match started well with a goal in
the first five minutes. But all too
soon they were up 2-1, when
"that fast girl" took a run at the
defence. While UCL celebrated
IC kicked in more goals, putting
us way ahead - UCL had no
hope of catching us. The other
two goals were scored by the
Canadian Crusader and Green
Crusader.
IC 1 STS: The game lasted 90
minutes but unfortunately the
IC Men's 1st didn't; a makeshift
team consisting of several pie-
eaters from the seconds surpris-
ingly took control from the start
with Roddy Herreis kicking
everyhting that came near him.
This was rewarded when, after
fine work by Pierre on the left,
Roddy slotted the ball into the
sprout bag. However, lack of fit-
ness showed, with UCL equalis-
ing on the stroke of half-time
after Phil Siverns and Roddy
failed to clear, having been dis-
tracted by a passing pie van.
The second half saw IC
retake the lead with Mark lob-
bing the keeper following a punt
up field from Tony. After this,
IC had the lion's share of the
play with commanding perfor-
mances from Richie and Crispin
on the right, and Tony and
Matteo solid in defence.
It was at this point that
Dixon was thought to have "run
for the ball", but this has since
been discounted as a vicious
rumour. Unfortunately IC were
unable to extend their lead and
the inevitable UCL equaliser
came within three minutes to
go. Not a bad result for the fat
boys though, and the season
looks promising if we can only
keep Dixon away from
MacDonalds....
IC 4THS: IC fourth's campaign
started with a good performance
away at UCL. Although goalless,
the match swung from end to
end producing great excitement
for the spectator.
Chances were missed by
both sides and perhaps the IC's
captain, Morgan Hill, can count
himself unluckiest after hitting
the woodwork twice. Solid per-
formances also by the defence,
notably Jez and Michael in the
centre, and Stuart in goal. The
midfield was dominated by
Steph who instigated many of
IC's better moves.
n e t b a l l
1 STS: It was a new look team
and everyone was apprehensive
as to how the match would go.
Last year the UCL team got
throught o the last eight in the
BUSA tournament so we knew
we had our work cut out.
The first quarter went really
well; the defence were excep-
tional, forscing UCL shooters to
miss shots and make mistakes
leaving the quarter-time score at
6-4 to UCL
In the second quarter the
attack tried to work the ball
around the but the UCL defence
were quick and intercepted the
weaker passes to give a halftime
score of 14-8 to UCL.
We changed our attack at
half-time to accommodate some
fresh legs which improved the
passing in the gameplay, but we
were denied the end goals.
Everyone worked extremely
hard but couldn't seem to cut
down UCL's lead to leave the
final score 33-13.
We were tired but quite
happy, as last season UCL beat
us 76-16.
2NDS:
After the first team had
stolen 11 players from the squad
and left the seconds with only
seven, we didn't expect too
much. However, after borrowing
a star defender from UC things
looked more hopeful, and when
Juliette scored the opener, we
began to take control.
Two more goals before half-
time from Helen and Shami put
smiles on our faces, the only
danger being that we would run
out of breath before the end.
The half-time breather helped,
and five (that's five) more goals
from Juliette in the second half
as well as Shami's second, left
the scoreline looking
respectable!
