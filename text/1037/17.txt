Jake's Progress
Jake Shillingford is sat in a burger bar in
America, and he has a vision. A big pop
vision. A Phil Spector wall of sound, a real
live band, big songs, big attitude - throw in
the kitchen sink and see what you get.
He returns to England, and as any pop
visionary would, begins to trawl the
Northern Line for like minded busking
musicians. Soon, he has surrounded himself
with a maverick bunch of classical musicians
and like-minded pop tarts and "My Life
Story" were born.
Several years later, after three top
singles and the criminally ignored
"Mornington Crescent" LP, MLS have taken
part in the ShakerMaker tour, made a
storming appearance at Reading, and are
about to bring their 20 legged groove
machine to ICU for a special warm up show
for their gig at the LA2 next month.
My Life Story are a big band in every
way - 10 musicians on stage, and Jake
Shillingford coming across as Jarvis Cocker's
sharp suited cockney cousin, means that this
is one of the sexiest live acts of the moment
- no heads down staring at the monitors. No
bedroom knob twiddling (musically
speaking) here, it's full on in your face sex
and glamour.
As Jake says, "Pop music is sex, it's
about having your testicles fondled on stage,
it's the essence of stimulating people to have
sex with one another. The great thing about
British pop is that suddenly a great band
come along and everyone changes their
haircut. That's what it's all about - sex and
haircuts".
And even though you may not have
heard them yet, in an era when there aren't
that many bright stars shining, My Life Story
deserve to be one of those great groups.
So, for a dose of aural sex, be in the
Ents. Lounge at 10pm tonight - pop music
may never seem the same again.
