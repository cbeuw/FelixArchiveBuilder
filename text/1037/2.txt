Jenkin Harks back to Thatcher
" W e ' v e g o t t o b e o n o u r m e t t l e i n t h e m o n t h s a h e a d "

One of the yoLingest mem-
bers of the Parliamentary
Conservative Party, Mr Bernard
Jenkin, spoke for an hour to an
Imperial College Consoc meeting
on 'The Changing Face of
Conservatism', reflecting particu-
larly on 20th century history.
One of his few comments on the
present political situation was
that: "We've got to be on our
mettle in the months and years
ahead".
Having just shared a taxi to
Imperial College with Margaret
Beckett, former deputy leader of
the Labour Party, Mr Jenkin
reminded his audience of the
Winter of Discontent and eco-
nomic collapse in the 1970s. The
_MP for North Colchester was 20
when Margaret Thatcher was
elected, "[when] Trotskis and
Communists were in the main-
stream". He went on to mention
the UK's £2bn loan from the
International Monetary Fund and
cited the circumstances of the
day as the reasons for the election

of Mrs Thatcher. He also spoke
of his and the Conservative
Party's position with regard to
Europe and how the end of the
cold war also brought about an
end to Europe's stability, citing
the war in the former Yugoslavia
as a prime example.
But the talk wasn't all policy:
Mr. Jenkin gave an anecdote of
his taxi journey to South
Kensington with Labour's
Margaret Beckett, who went to 'a
very posh restaurant' with a 'jour-
nalist from the Sun'. This youth-
ful Member of Parliament sur-
passed himself in the entertain-
ment role, as one attendee sug-
gested that Mr Jenkin's impres-
sion of Enoch Powell would even
have put Rory Bremner to shame.
Willis Displinary to be Re-run

'unhappy' with the outcome of
Monday's disciplinary meeting,
and was visibly incensed shortly
after its conclusion. Informed
sources suggest that his punish-
ment includes suspension of
Imperial College Union member-
ship and a £100 fine.
Others have insisted that
this is not the case and that the
forwarding of a motion of no con-
fidence to the next Council
meeting was Mr Willis' greatest
reprimand. It appears that the
following morning Mr Willis
lodged an appeal against the
Committee's decision.
At Tuesday evening's
Executive Committee meeting,
the matter was discussed and
technical points were raised over
the of the previous day's pro-
ceedings. The disciplinary needed
to have at least six members pre-
sent to be quorate, but there
were only five present.
Subsequently Mr Willis received
word that he could request a
rerun of the Disciplinary hearing
with different members on the
panel, or that he could go ahead
with his original appeal.
The forceful reaction of the
Committee goes against the
apparent exoneration of Mr
Willis by College Security, who
noted the Rag Chair's 'commend-
able actions' on hearing of the
fresher's condition.
Concern has been expressed
that College's anxiety over drink-
ing issues influenced the
Executive Committee decision,
with further questions being
raised by the non-appearance at
the disciplinary meeting of the
biochemistry fresher at the cen-
tre of the affair.
Speaking to Felix, Imperial
College Union President, Sarah
White, refused to comment on
the substance of the
Committee's decision, or the
later Executive Committee
meeting. She did say that the
hearing's decision had been unan-
imous, and that the outcome was
'felt to be appropriate'. She said
that Willis knew in advance that
the meeting would be inquorate,
and he had not objected.
Responding to the threat of a
vote of no-confidence in the
Executive, mooted by one of Mr
Willis's supporters, Ms White
said that she had 'heard nothing
of it' and pointed out that similar
measures against ' previous
Presidents had never come to
anything.
