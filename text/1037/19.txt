Presents....
For those who didn't attend Fresher's Fair,
so missed our stall, and who have walked
around with their eyes closed, so haven't
seen our posters, A N D those who missed
our adverts in the last two editions of Felix,
IMPERIAL COLLEGE HAS A CINEMA!!!!
Yes, you may find it on the second floor of
the Union building.
I have been instructed to inform you all
that we show the finest films, presented in
Dolby Stereo Surround Sound, and
wherever possible in Cinemascope, and
most importantly we are a fraction of the
price of your average London cinema.
During the week we will be presenting
two films: the first, BAD BOYS, will be
shown on Sunday 22nd October, if non-stop
cop-action is what you like, then this,
starring the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Will
Smith, is for you. And on Wednesday 25th
October you can see THE BRADY BUNCH
- THE MOVIE, the perfect seventies family
trapped in the nineties. Worth watching just
for the Monkies.
Both shows will commence at 8pm.
