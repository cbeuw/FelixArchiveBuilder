ugly hairy arses and pressed them
against the perspex, and I've been
called every name under the sun. I
wish you and the rest of the
Union would get your head out of
your respective arses and try to
appreciate music for what it is,
not just because it fits into a par-
ticular style which you have
decided you like. My music col-
lection ranges from Nirvana to
Goldie, through a lot of different
"genres" on the way. I don't care
which pigeon hole the music I like
has been put into, but I think a lot
of Imperial does.
I enjoyed Freshers week, did
you?

To refuse to play the music
which people, request, and then
complain about the abuse you
receive for doing so, strikes me as
somewhat redundant.
Why is it unfortunate, that
people at Imperial have widely
varying musical tastes? If your
tastes are so eclectic, why don't
you share them with the people
who come to the Wednesday
night discos?
Speaking as someone whose
tastes run from metal to ambient
(via pop, indie, soul, blues, classi-
cal and any number of other
pigeonholes), I would far rather
hear a variety of music than an
evening "wholly or partly charac-
terised by a succession of repeti-
tive beats".
Especially when it's forced
on me through the wall.

I suppose it was fairly par for the
course we should be submerged
in a mire of union political tech-
nicalities as soon as council was
up and running again. Whilst I
can see perfectly well that there
isn't a great deal of point in hav-
ing a constitution if it is going to
be continually flouted, I am not
convinced that the current fairly
typical wranglings are an utterly
constructive use of our time.
The three union office sabs were
elected to be our representation
and our voice, and at a time
when student facilities and high-
er education in general is in a
great state of flux. It would seem
crucial that the student body is
kept informed and represented
at every level. I wonder just how
much time Sarah White got to
prepare for her meeting with the
Rector yesterday morning?
If we are to continue to bring
new people in annually to do the
job, then we will surely continue
to go through the same minor
misunderstandings and confu-
sions every year, presumably
wasting a great deal of time and
effort, not to mention getting a
fraction tiresome. Surely a more
flexible approach is possible...?

Not that I would wish to com-
plain where it wasn't justified,
but if I were a proper resident of
Selkirk Hall rather than just
someone who uses it to catch the
occasional half hour's kip
between photocopying jobs, I
might question housekeeping's
timing. I would probably be jolly
impressed that they were resur-
facing all the desks and defrost-
ing the refrigerators, but I would
wonder if they couldn't have
more conveniently done it over
the large chunks of the summer
when the hall was almost com-
pletely empty.
We're getting really hypothetical
here, but I might think it was
something of a nuisance that my
sole work-surface disappeared
from my room when we were
well into term. I would think it
sensible and safety conscious, if a
little tiring, that there was a fire
drill at 7.30 in the morning on
Tuesday. But I would find it a
fraction ironic if I still had wires
hanging out out of ceiling where
someone started to install a
smoke detector two months ago.

Oh, Mark, there are lots and lots
of positive things to say about
ents: the comedy last Friday was
really good. It must take a rare
kind of comic to get a room full
of careworn scientists to laugh
hysterically about hyenas eating
their neighbours with a nice
Burgundy.
