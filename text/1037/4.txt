FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 20TH 1995 NEWS
New Directors at
Health Centre
BY JEREMY CLARKE
IC Health Centre now has
two new directors to replace Dr
Raanan Gillon, who has just
retired after 13 years as head of
the service. Dr Gillon has been
succeeded by Dr Irene Weinreb
(as Director of Clinical Services)
and Dr Alan Swan (as Director of
Occupational Health).
Dr Gillon has left the direc-
torship in order to take up a posi-
tion as in the Humanities depart-
ment, though he will remain a
GP at the Health Centre two
days a week. Dr Gillon is the
new Professor of Science Ethics,
setting up a new centre that will
analysise the ethical considera-
tions in medical and scientific
research. Speaking to Felix, Dr
Gillon said that he was keen to
consider the many questions that
scientific research posed rather
than 'crusade a specific cause'.
He explained that there
were a variety of areas that he
wanted to look at, including
research funding and intellectual
copyright.
Move Confirmed
It has been confirmed that
the Centre itself will be fully
relocated (Felix 1034) by the
beginning of next Summer. With
their present site in 14 Princes'
Gardens becoming available for
redevelopment, the question has
yet to be answered as to whether
the accommodation, for which
the Health Centre's present site
has been earmarked, will be
made available for IC students.
The Director of Estates, Mr
Ian Caldwell, has told Felix that
the building work will commence
during Easter 1996, and that it
should be completed by the fol-
lowing June. The Health Centre
will then be relocated to the east
end of Southside to what is
presently the Conference Suite.
According to Estates the lack of
conference facilities will not have
a significant impact. Mr Caldwell
maintains that they are 'not cost
effective' and it would not be
worth bringing them 'up-to-date'
given their infrequent use.
The site in Southside will be
purpose-built, and will have larg-
er and improved facilities.
Presently, wheelchair access is
inadequate, and it is also hoped
that the larger site will help the
Health Centre staff to communi-
cate more effectively and provide
a better service for students and
other patients.

Dr Irene Weinreb is the new Director of Clinical Services
Dr Weinreb said that the
students would feel 'more part of
the services' the centre being
closer to halls. She also stressed
that funding for the project has
already been set aside as part of
the Tomlinson Report for the
improvement of health services
in the area. In order to supple-
ment its growing practice, the
Health Centre hopes to appoint a
new GP next year following the
completion of the move.
Dr Weinreb was disappoint-
ed only in that the view of a gar-
den would be lost, but generally
she felt that the relocation of the
Health Centre is of benefit to all
concerned, especially the
patients.
News in brief

NICK ADAMS
Hizb-ut-Tahrir Still Active
The fundamentalist Islamic
group Hizb-ut-Tahrir have once
again been distributing leaflets
around Imperial College. The lit-
erature, entitled "Mediaeval
Witch-hunt against Islam In
British Universities", has been
found in various departments,
and other copies have been found
affixed to notice boards around
the campus. It is not clear
whether IC Students or outside
activists are responsible for the
recent distribution.
In a related incident London
Guildhall University was recently
closed down completely for an
afternoon, on the advice of the
police. This was in response to a
demonstration organised by the
Islamic organisation against
Guildhall's Student Union.
2-way Channel Swim
During the summer a second year
maths student from IC swam
from England to France and back
again. Nick Adams completed
the 42 mile swim (the equivalent
of 2710 lengths of a standard
pool) in an impressive 27 hours
and 28 minutes.
The Channel swim, acknowl-
edged as the ultimate in the sport
of long distance swimming, start-
ed at 9am on Sunday June 23rd
from Shakespeare Beach, Dover.
Nick swam alongside a support
boat whose crew were kept busy
feeding and encouraging the
swimmer. Feeding took place
every half hour and consisted of
hot chocolate and and a carbohy-
drate drink, vital to prolong
endurance. Jellyfish, strong cur-
rents and the occasional ferry had
to be contended with.
Calais was reached before
sunset, and after standing on the
beach for a few seconds the long
swim home through the night
began, finishing at 12.28 pm on
June 24th. The swim will gain
recognition in the Guinness Book
of Records as Nick is the
youngest person to swim the
channel in both directions.
