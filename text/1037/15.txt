Peru was our second stop
after Venezuela, by virtue
of our budget ticket. Peru
was home of the Incas
until the Conqistadors
slaughtered them all. I
know that sounds harsh,
but what the
Spaniards did
over there
rivals some J
of the \
British i |
colonial
atrocities.
Anyway, we arrived in Lima airport
and the ride into the city showed us a
capital that is dirty, grey, smoggy and
almost perpetually overcast (sounds
like Sheffield?) - indeed it is said that
after the Spanish conquered the
Incas, they asked them where would
be a good place to build their
capital.The Incas, in revenge, pointed
them to where Lima is now, a place
that gets nine months of fog a year. I
don't know if this is true, but if it is,
then it is apt revenge.
Depressed by the place and worried by
tales of crime, we immediately caught an
overnight bus to Pern's second city,
Afequipa.This city is in the western Peruvian
Andes and lies at an altitude of 1600m -
already higher than Ben Nevis and yet over
61XXX.X) people live here. It was from this base
that we visited Colca Canyon, supposedly the
world's deepest. Standing at the lip of the
anyoh^thebottomvic^Flkm away was
scarcely visible, however, it was not the bottom
that we were there to see but the great condors
that soar on the morning thermals in search of
prey. They glide past you with an effortless
grace, seemingly as curious about you as you're
about them, and their true dimensions only
become apparent when their shadow passes
over you and their wingspan covers seven feet.
On the walk back to the village we were
treated to the sight of the nearby (but
fortunately not too nearby) volcano,
'Sabancaya', erupting. The Andes, a
^ geologically young chain of mountains are
" V still active and volcanoes are to be
found from Ecuador down to
Chile. As we watched it,
Sabancaya pushed tonnes
of ash into the
k atmosphere
. while the
local farmers
carried on
ploughing their
fields, completely
unfazed.
Our next stop was
the Inca capital of
J' Cusco. From here we
embarked upon the four day
hike along the Inca trail. Altitude
became a problem for us here as we
topped passes at 4200m. The trail, built
around the 13/14th century A D leads to
the mined city of Machu Picchu (meaning
Old Peak, the Incas worshiped and,
annoyingly built their cities on mountains).
This, was a religious centre visited by priests
and pilgrims, perched precariously above the
sacred Urubambariver,it was supposed to be
the last stop on the royal road of the Incas to
the fabled lost city where the Incas hid all their
gold after the Spanish arrived (it is now no
longer fabled or lost as it was discovered by two
Italian explorers in 1986 and is currently being
excavated).
After some three weeks in Pern we were
Inca'd up and, with three weeks remaining,
decided on a change of scene and therefore
headed for Bolivia and its border crossing,
Copacabana... but that's a story for another day.
