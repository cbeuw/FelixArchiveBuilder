IC Rag
Rag has had a very sucessful start to this
term, with large turnouts to both meetings
and our weekend events.
Tiddlywinks along Oxford Street went
very well. Congratulations to Ken Pritchard
who received the top collector's prizes for
raising over 40 pounds for Action Aid. The
event total was £468.23.
Last Saturday's Monopoly went just as
well, with teams collecting together around
the monopoly board locations and answering
questions about the areas. £626.22 was
raised for Mencap, who organised a party in
the evening for all the students who had
travelled to London.
The top IC team was the Africas
connection: Eoun Harris, Jenny Gadsden,
Karen Eccleshall, Angela Petri and Oliver
Mann. The top individual collector was C &
G Vice President Duncan Tindell with a
total of almost $70.
We are planning more events this term
so come along to our meeting at 1 pm on
Friday. Everybody is welcome.

ItalSoc
Hello folks! (or should I say ciao) from the
new, reformed, ever-so-enthusiastic Italian
Society. Before you turn your eyes away
from this article, thinking 'Why should I
bother, I don't even know what an Italian
looks like', let me give you some incentives:
First, we DO NOT spend our time
discussing our favourite pizza toppings,
contrary to popular opinion. We might even
get as serious as inviting a former member of
Cabinet to come here so they comment on
the current state of our national economy.
Secondly, over a third of our members
last year were non-Italians, so our society has
become a meeting place for people
interested in Italy, and Italians eager to
practise their language skills... What about
activities? Well, judge for yourself: great
Italian movies, subsidised concert tickets,
meal trips to restaurants around the city,
volleyball and soccer tournaments, Pasta &
Wine evenings, and anything else the
committee cares to come up with... (I don't
need to remind you about the European
Championship next Spring, do I?) But, as for
anything in life, you don't have to take
somebody else's word for it. Come and
check it out for yourself.
Our first event will be on Oct 24th at
6:00 pm, and promises to be great fun. It's
going to take place in the Common Room of
Materials on level seven. The cost? A mere
£1 for members (membership is £3), and £4
for non-members.
If you need more info, we hold a
meeting on Monday (lunchtime) in the JCR.
You can e-mail me (cabodima@ic.ac.uk), or
leave a message in the ItalSoc pigeon-hole at
the Union. Find me in Physics. (UG III) or,
consult our Web Page, provided I find the
time to set it up... A presto, Mario.
