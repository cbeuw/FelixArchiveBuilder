Then I respond to enquiries people
have - the archives are here to be used. I'm
happy to provide whatever information any-
one needs. I think the level of service you
Mounting exhibitions raises the profile
of the archives and therefore college inter-
nationally. I have spent a lot of time in the
past year working on tin ns noti
the centenary of Huxley's death. These
things are very time consuming - even if I :

know about it, I have to read up on every-
thing to make sure it's just right.
It's also very important to document
current science properly. I have to be aware
of what's being chucked out now that
should be kept. The IT revolution is really â€¢
scary from the point of view of current
records. People communicate by e-mail and
then it vanishes - it's the ideas that are
written down that are kept. It may only be
a line or two, but it might be crucial. The
idea is that computers are somehow
ephemeral - but if you haven't kept it then
what have you done really? I heard someone
at the International Council on Archives
Conference in America recently saying he
didn't keep a lab book at all anymore, he
just kept everything on computer. O f
course you've got disks, but is anyone going
to have the appropriate technology to use
them in the next century? We have to alert
people to this.

What will make you come into work
tomorrow?
It will be another day to look after the
archives, be asked interesting questions and
to find the answers, meet researchers, talk
to staff and students, discuss archive mat-
ters with other archivists, and history of sci-
ence with other historians by e-mail interna
tionally.
And I will think about my thesis... I just
enjoy myself, really.
