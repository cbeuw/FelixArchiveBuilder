Anyway you look at it, Menswe@r is an
absolutely daft name for a band. Totally uncool.
Goes to show how far you can go when you have
someone prodairning your name to the world
every other week (I thought it was Men Swear -
Thick Ed). As a debut album from such a hyped
up band, it ing the
3mou ly out
there.
ing. The One should have been the single instead
of Daydreamer, while piece of me, being brave
(how did love get into this?) and hattywood girls
(bar thatricUcufouscapping sequence) provided
the high points in an otherwise unremarkable
debut. It comes as no surprise that the better
tracks come with strings attached.
Menswe@r wants to be the Britpop™ band
that everyone will hum to. They embrace the
essence ol pop without shame, which is totally
acceptable provided they accept s

The evening really started on the train as we tried
to explain to Dan what thrash-pop meant. 'It's
not really pop and it's certainly not thrash,' we
said. 'It's loud,' we explained. And more band-
specifically; 'he's called Wiz and sometimes he
writes really good lyrics and he sometimes does-
n't but he certainly can't sing'.
Which is probably as succinct as you can get when
you're telling someone about Mega City Four —
a band who started out with the first wave of
Britrock™; Carter, Senseless Things an'all.
The Garage is nearly full with the old crowd as
support Cottonmouth cut their way through
songs that drip heavy with melody. In front of us
a skinny guy with dreds necks a girl half his age.
As they slowly turn around, I realise that there's
only one person that can be that sldnny and dred-
dy.
Next time I see Wiz he's up onstage, croaking out
the orjening, unaccompanied words of 'Iron Sky'.
In a vain attempt at normality his voice has mas-
sive amounts on reverb on it, so it now croaks and
echoes as well. Not that the lads at the front
minded as they frantically pogo around and
there's no reason not to. Mega City Four are cer-
tainly loud and they known how to play a good
live show. No flarinelling, no fat, they crash
through the standards from their last two albums
and mix in a few, newer and less tuneful numbers.
And for the odd moment you could be forgiven
for thinking that Blur and the nineties had never
happened, except that everyone isjust slighdy too
old for that now. Well about a decade actually.
