'High Spirits' Lead to Vandalism
£20,000 Damage to
College Already this T

BY JEREMY CLARKE
An estimate of £20,000 has been
put on the damage caused by the
numerous acts of vandalism
which have already occurred
across the college campus this
term.
While some reports say that
takings from various College
drinking establishments have fall-
en with respect to previous years,
students appear to have kept
themselves occupied by other
means.
In particular, the car park
barrier on Watt's Way has been
damaged at least three times in
as many weeks: being missing
more often than present. Even
with a security camera pointing
directly on the barrier area, Felix
still managed to stage the recon-
struction pictured above.
The barrier controls the traf-
fic in and out of the area sur-
rounding Southside and Linstead
halls of residence, enabling
Imperial College security staff
to monitor the much over-sub-
scribed parking spaces.
Speaking to Felix, Mr Ian
Caldwell, Director of Estates,
admitted that an "unfortunate
amount of damage" has occurred.
He attributed much of this to
'high spirits' in the student popu-
lation. Mr Caldwell stressed that
the cost of the damage would be
in the region of £10,000 -
£20,000.
He further insisted that
future replacements for some of
the damaged property would
hopefully be of a more 'robust'
nature, in an attempt to limit
the effects of any possible fur-
ther attacks.
Security sources in the past
have criticised the original Watts
Way parking barrier as being far
too flimsy for its designated pur-
pose.

Council Capers Carry On
BY THE NEWS TEAM
A total rerun of the recent
Imperial College Union Council
elections will be proposed at an
emergency meeting of the body,
scheduled for next Friday.
The motion is being put for-
ward by the Union's Executive
Committee following complaints
that the recent voting procedures
were unconstitutional.
The proposal does not cover
the election of Eric Allsop,
Council Chair, even though he
was proposed by Matt
Crompton, Deputy President
Finance & Services, a move
which is accepted as unlawful. It
is being suggested that the Union
must have a Council Chair, a post
which also carries the job of
Executive Chair, and that too
many difficulties would result in
the position being vacant for a
fortnight.
If the emergency meeting of
Council does accept the Exec's
motion of voiding the previous
elections, all ordinary member
posts will become vacant for the
two weeks between papers going
up advertising the positions and
the subsequent elections. The
lack of papers being posted was
the main basis for the argument
that the previous elections were
unfair.
Some students who wished
to become ordinary members
were affronted that the elections
had taken place without their
knowledge, and that therefore
Council was not representative of
the ordinary members of
Imperial College.
Imperial College Union
President, Sarah White, is being
criticised for the conduct of the
elections and does personally
accept some responsibility for the
present disarray saying: "I sup-
pose you could say that it was my
fault."
She insists though, that the
preparation of the elections was
the responsibility of the three
Sabbatical Officers during vaca-
tion, and that of the whole of the
Executive Committee during
term time. It is hoped that the
additions to the Constitution,
which recent events have shown
to be needed, will be ready for
the full Council meeting in three
weeks time.
The present Union
Constitution, which was passed
just before Christmas of last year,
does not clearly state the manner
in which ordinary member elec-
tions should proceed.
The forthcoming elections
will all be conducted under the
Single Transferable Voting sys-
tem with ballot papers issued for
each separate post.
