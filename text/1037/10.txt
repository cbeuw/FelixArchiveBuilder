Soak up the atmosphere at this restaurant - it's
so neat that I wonder why I haven't come here
before.. The decor is fantastic, with the occa-
sional china pig or chicken amongst the oak pan-
elling. Entering the Shack, you move through a
well fitted bar and down into the moodily lit
seating area. It could almost be
New Orleans (or possibly even
Chicago).
The bar is well stocked and
serves a wide range of cocktails -
there's a Happy Hour for those
few alcoholics amongst us. We were already well
oiled, however I may return later for a
Margherita or two.
A large sign on the wall bears the motif
"Bone Appetit" - indeed if you come here you
would do well to try the ribs. My companion did
- the ribs were not "spare", but succulent baby
ribs, with a fantastic barbeque sauce. This sauce
plays havoc with your eating manners - be pre-
pared for the useful plastic bib. They came with
lovely fried potatoes and a kind of coleslaw, both
up to the standard of the main offering.
"be prepared
for the useful
plastic bib"
While my companion was "ribbed", I had
chosen the chicken BUT, which was spot on.
Everything was crisp and fresh, the sandwich as
worthy as the Harrods club sandwich - sadly no
longer available.
After such a great main course, we turned
quickly to desert. My companion chose the hot
pecan pie, which turned out to be
fantastic while I plumped for the
key lime pie, which was unfortu-
nately nothing more than a lemon
tart, although it was light and deli-
riously sharp.
The Rib Shack is the perfect restaurant
for a party, or perhaps just a social lunch. Go for
to absorb not only the food but the atmosphere.
You can always ask for a doggy bag if you don't
finish...
Expect to pay £10 -15 per person.

Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh
dear.
You know, whenever I go to review films, I
have to stop myself from writing the review in
my head before I get there, to avoid letting my
prejudices affect my appreciation of the movie.
But my pre-view review was right in this
case; in fact, I'd go so far as to say it was gener-
ous.
The poop sheet quoted the director as
hoping that people would leave the theatre
thinking, "What a good story", rather than
"What great special effects" or "What great
fight scenes". I left the theatre thinking, "That's
an hour and forty minutes of my life down the
toilet".
The only way I can possibly justify such a
waste of my time is by writing this and telling
you to avoid this film at all costs. It wasn't just
bad, it was baaad - it went beyond mere awful,
way past utterly dreadful, and (hyperbole be
damned) disappeared over the horizon of the
truly terrible.
The story was pathetic and puerile, the
characters were one-dimensional, and what
dialogue existed was so cliched it was comedic.
As mindless entertainment, this was a perfect
translation of the arcade game. As a film, how-
ever, it stank.
In the end, the only nearly redeeming fea-
tures of the film were the fight scenes and spe-
cial effects and, stunning though they were,
they weren't enough to make sitting through
the rest worthwhile. I gave up seeing Lee &
Herring for this - please don't make the same
mistake. Rating: minus several million.
