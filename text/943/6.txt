Nick Allen writes of his experiences with the IC Symphony Orchestra
as they travel to Hungary and back.
When Ihe idea of taking the
orchestra to Hungary was first
mooted a little over a year ago, the
whole project seemed impossible.
The logistics of taking a 75 piece
symphony orchestra complete with
instruments anywhere is an
organiser's nightmare. Add to this
the fact that the orchestra were
going to do an exchange with a
Hungarian choir, coupled with the
communication problems that this
entailed, the tour might never have
happened. However, a year later at
the beginning of September, the
Budapest Academic Choral Society
visited London to perform two
concerts with Imperial College
Symphony Orchestra, and both
parties returned to Hungary
together to perform a further three
concerts.
The choir arrived on Saturday
12th September, exhausted after a
two day non-stop coach journey.
They spent a pleasant Sunday on a
sightseeing tour and lunching at the
Queen's Arms. They were joined
by the orchestra who arrived in
London on the Monday to a busy
rehearsal schedule, having to
prepare for two performances of
Verdi Requiem in this country as
well as an orchestral programme of
works performed during the
previous year for two concerts in
Hungary. Around this they also had
to fit a reception at the Hungarian
Embassy, a welcome party, and a
lunch at the Old Bridge Hotel in
Huntingdon just outside
Cambridge.
The choir's conductor, Maestro
Gabor Hollerung, was to conduct
the two performances in England
and rehearsals with him were an
experience. With very little
English, he was able to
communicate his musical ideas with
gestures, vocal demonstrations of
the sound he wanted, Italian musical
terminology and some german in a
way which was able to transcend all
barriers between our two countries.
Consequently, the concerts in the
Royal College of Music and in
Cambridge University Concert
Hall, with soloists from the English
opera scene, were occasions that
none of the choir or orchestra will
forget.
After a two day journey by coach
with a stopover in Heidelberg, the
orchestra arrived in Budapest. After
In rehearsal in Budapest.
a short wait for the choir's coaches,
everyone was paired with host
families, and the hectic schedule
began with a rehearsal followed by
a picnic by the not so beautiful blue
Danube, cooked by the choir's
conductor.
On Monday, after a spot of
sightseeking, the orchestra travelled
to the town of Veszprem, near the
Balaton Lake, to perform its first
orchestral concert at the University
Concert Hall. The programme,
consisting of some British works
rarely heard in Hungary and
Mahler's 4th Symphony, was well
received and the rythmic
handclapping which is the norm in
Hungary, was greeted with much
amusement by the orchestra.
The choir had been sponsored by
one of Hungary's leading wine
cellars, which meant that the
following day we were taken to the
cellar just outside Budapest and
given a guided tour by the chief
cellar master and owner. This was
followed by a tasting session of
three different champagnes which
was enjoyed by all, and copious
bottles were bought at ridiculously
cheap prices. The orchestra then
returned to Budapest, where the
vice-ambassador of the British
Embassy, Howard Pearce, hosted
a reception.
The Wednesday was probably the
highlight of the whole two weeks.
This was a performance of the
Verdi Requiem under the
orchestra's conductor Richard
Dickins in the splendidly ornate
surroundings of the Liszt Academy
of Music. The concert hall was so
packed that there were people
standing in both galleries. Both the
orchestra and choir were on top
form and we had four of Hungary's
top opera soloists singing with us.
Everything contributed to making
this a profound and moving
experience.
The final day was spent
sightseeing, and trying desperately
to spend our remaining Hungarian
currency on cheap sheet music,
cheap alcohol, cheap food, and
cheap cassettes and CDs, as well as
performing our last orchestral
concert in the elegant surroundings
of the Mayor's Ceremonial Hall.
Again, this was well received
despite there being the inaugral
concert of a new orchestra in
Budapest and also a major political
demonstration that attracted in the
order of a quarter of a million
people.
After an all-night party, the coach
started the long trek back home via
Heidelberg, and everyone arrived
back in London very tired, but all
enriched by the customs, the
hospitality, the music, the beauty of
Budapest, and the exchange of ideas
between two groups of young
talented musicians from two
completelv different backgrounds.
ICSO enjoy the finer things in life.
