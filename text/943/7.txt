Helping the Homeless
Kevin McCandless investigates the homeless situation and the efforts
some people are making to ease it.
A bedraggled old man clutching his
bottle of wine as he sleeps in a
Covent Garden doorway, a
dishevelled 16-year-old scrounging
through the garbage cans in the
back of a Chelsea fast-food
restaurant for dinner. Still rare
sights in London, but becoming
increasingly common as experts
warn that the city is coming
perilously close to emulating New
York or Rio de Janeiro in their out-
of-control homeless problems.
While the exact number of
homeless people on the streets of
London is hard to pin down,
homeless organisations put it at the
tens of thousands and growing, with
over two million homeless in the
whole of England. Despite this,
those who work at putting homeless
people back into the main stream of
society say that society itself is
turning a blind eye to the problem.
T think one of the most
frightening things is that we're like
New York in the sense that you
walk over homeless people, that
you push them out of the way to
wherever you're going,' says Daly
Maxwell, senior social worker at St
Botolph's Day Centre in Aldgate.
'People are begging on the streets
and I don't think we're really
prepared to tackle that.'
For the past thirty years, St
Botolph's Day Centre has been
involved in getting the homeless off
the streets, giving them a place
where they can get a warm meal
and a hot shower. During the
decade that Maxwell has worked
with the centre, he says that there
has been the emergence of a new
type of homeless. Where once the
centre saw mostly the old
'gentleman tramp' come through its
doors, people from a myriad of
backgrounds now come to the
centre for help.
'The old-fashioned homeless
person has disappeared in the sense
of the bushy beard, the overcoat and
the bottle of bass,' said Maxwell,
whose centre handles over three
hundred people a day. 'They've all
died, or ninety nine percent of them
have died. Today in Britain you're
faced with people who are isolated,
people who are without any work,
money or housing. They're the
homeless of today in Britain.'
With the recession and the re-
structuring of the British economy
during the last ten years, many of
the blue-collar jobs that once kept
a person off the streets are no longer
there. In addition, Maxwell accused
financially strapped institutions
throughout the country of
'dumping' patients in the real world
with little or no preparation.
Because of the heterogeneousness
of such a group, which also includes
the fifty thousand or so young
people who come to London and
wind up homeless, getting each
person off the streets is a case by
case basis. Getting someone back
into society is more expensive and
time-consuming than just providing
them with a bed and a meal, but
Maxwell thinks that it's worth it in
the long run: 'It costs a lot of money
to care for people on an individual
basis but I think it's actually in
Britain's best interests to do so.'
During the last year, the centre has
helped about sixty people into new
homes and new jobs.
But once a person returns to a
normal life, there is still a period
of re- adjustment which can throw
even the most determined of
individuals. Everyday skills like
cooking meals and going shopping,
which most people take for granted,
sometimes have to be learned all
over again.
'My first eight weeks off the
streets were a nightmare,' says
Robert Winter, a Big Issue editor
who had himself been homeless. T
spent two years out of doors and
then suddenly there was a ceiling
over me. I got claustrophobia and
it seemed like the bed was too soft.'
Even talking politely with people,
said Winter, was a skill he had to
learn all over again. Once he had
woken up from whatever hole he
had chosen to spend the night, he
could spend his day by going from
day centre to day centre, finding
shelter from the elements and
getting food to eat.
'People may think it's easy being
homeless,' said Winter. 'But you're
actually out walking on the streets
all day, going from place to place.'
Like many other homeless people
he knows, Winter said he thought
he'd be off the streets fairly soon
after he lost his job. However, after
being exposed each day to the harsh
weather and the contempt of his
fellow man, he grew discouraged
and saw his expected few weeks
stretch into months.
'The homeless lose their jobs and
One of London's homeless
say quite arrogantly, 'Oh, I'll get
another job in a week',' said
Winter. T know. It happened to
me... But then you run out of
money and where you're staying
says 'Ok, where's my money?'.'
'A lot of people who end up
homeless like this often become
permanently traumatised. You
might have gone from living with
your mother one day, in a nice cosy
apartment, to ending up sleeping
down by Embankment,' said
Maxwell. 'Now, that is one hell of
a shock to the system.'
Both Maxwell and Winter say
that there is currently too much
emphasis on short-term solutions,
such as hostels, to take care of the
problem. Even where there are
long-term programs in place,
Winter added, too many different
agencies providing the same
services lead to redundancies.
'They have pilot schemes which
look very nice,' said Winter. 'One
or two councils have their act
together, but nationwide, they've
failed.'
One program in London which is
helping to get homeless people off
the street is the very paper that
Winter works for:Tfie Big Issue. It
attracts media attention from around
the world as a quality newspaper
sold by homeless people. The Big
Issue recently celebrated its first
birthday and now commands a
circulation of one hundred thousand
copies for each fortnightly issue.
In addition to allowing their
vendors to earn thirty pence for the
sale of each edition, the newspaper
also offers a number of programs
re-training people for new jobs.
But though Maxwell and Winter
admit that they sometimes get
discouraged by the dim prospect of
the homeless problem going away,
they say that they never let it get
them down.
'There's a lot of people I cannot
help,' said Maxwell. 'That's very
frustrating. But the bottom line is
that you have to keep going and
keep somehow working towards
justice.'
