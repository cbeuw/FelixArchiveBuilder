Friday Night Madness
Andy Kerr dons his dinnerjacket andpreparesfor thefreshers ball tonight,
miss it at your peril.
The Freshers' Ball is here and it's
party time at the Union.
Tonight the Nutty Boys hit
Imperial College in the Concert hall
and with two members of Madness
at the helm, they're sure to have
everyone dancing. They'll be
playing their own unique blend of
Ska and will be ably supported by
a soul/Blues Brothers band, the
Timewasters.
In the Lounge will be the
Rockingbirds. They've just
headlined at the Reading Festival
and have just completed an M T V
special recently. They'll be playing
a set crammed full of rock and
country rhinestones.
Elsewhere there'll be a casino,
cocktails, food, late bar till 2am and
a late, late disco. Get your tickets
now to avoid disappointment.
P.S. This is not a black tie event.
