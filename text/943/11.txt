Film
Les Amants Pu Pont Neuf
Lovers on the Pont-Neuf is the
dynamic love story of Michele
(Juliette Binoche) and Alex (Denis
Lavant). Alex lives rough, Michele
has decided to join him on the
bridge he lives on which is closed
for repairs. Michele is an artist with
a degenerative eye disease who has
chosen to live her last days of
sightedness on the streets . Alex
earns money by doing a
breathtaking fire-eating act on the
streets of Paris.
The first half of the film is spent
exploring the characters and
following the development of their
relationship. We then have a rather
hurried story that involves the
possibility of a cure for Michele's
eye disease, Alex trying to hide this
fact from her, for fear of losing her,
and the result of him being
sentenced to prison. She is cured,
he's out of prison; will their love
prevail?
The plot and characters of the
film are original and engaging, but
along with this the spectacular and
Theatre
Felix 943
imaginative visual and musical
content make it a film that I would
highly recommend. It's quite a long
film and a little uncomfortable at
times. If, like me, you 'lose'
yourself in films, you might find
that your concern for Alex and
Michele's survival in their brutal
environment distracts you from
their love affair. A good film, and
I for one, will be seeing it again.

Opera
Katya Kabanova
From the ominous timpani figure of
the opening bars, Janacek's Katya
Kabanova leaves the listener in no
doubt that it belongs among the very
greatest of 20th century operas.
Harsh, angular motifs and fleeting,
jagged ostinati, orchestrated in the
lean and pungent style of Janacek's
maturity, contrast fiercely with the
ecstatic lyricism of Katya's doomed
love for Boris.
Susan Bullock heads a strong cast
in this revival of Glyndebourne
Touring Opera's vivdly coloured
production, and, even if one misses
a certain visceral surge at one or
two key moments, the orchestra
under David Angus is always crisp
and ideally balanced.

The Misogynist
The play, written by Michael
Harding, opened at the Dublin
Theatre Festival in 1990. It then
played the Edinburgh Festival
where it was a complete sell-out
success.
The whole play is a monologue,
performed excellently by Tom
Hickney. He is a funny little man,
in his own attic talking away to
himself, engaged in an imaginary
world of ritual and abuse. He is
exploring the layrinth of fear and
hatred which is the essence of
misogyny. He is definitely different
from the usual character who
expresses his misogyny in heroic
violence. In the course of the play
he is tracing paths from patriarchal
religion to crimes against women.
So at the end that little man is not
funny any more.
According to M Harding, he
wrote this play especially in order
to offer some challenge to the
performance skills of Tom Hickney
and he has certainly managed it.
