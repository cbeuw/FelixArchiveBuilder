'Wear swipecards to cut crime'
by Our News Staff
College security services have
this week called for staff and
students to wear their, identity
'swipecards' at all times. The call
was issued in a bid to further
decrease the level of 'walk in' crime
at Imperial, and made in the week
when it was revealed that over
2,000 new identity 'swipecards'
were issued at the start of term.
Senior security officials are
claiming that the level of
'spectacular' crime at the college
has decreased markedly since the
introduction of the new electronic
identification 'swipecard' system
last Easter. The new system does
not appear to have made any impact
on the level of thefts from unlocked
or unoccupied offices. Security
chiefs are saying that the level of
'walk in - walk off crime would
slow if the swipecards were worn
at all times, as they say this would
help in the detection of strangers.
Five thefts occurred last Monday,
the first day of term. The items
stolen were a cheque book, a cycle
saddle, a purse and two wallets.
Kensington police are still
questioning a man detained after
being found in possession of cheque
books and cards stolen from the
college in September. College staff
and students are being advised to
telephone the Sherfield security
lodge on internal 3372 if their
swipecards are lost, or if they see
anything suspicious.
Also this week, the new College
Fire Officer appealed for students
to exercise restraint when
considering tampering with fire
fighting apparatus in Halls of
Residence. Graham Cox said that
the equipment was to 'protect and
save lives in an emergency', and
that tampering could 'turn an
emergency into a casualty'. Work
is continuing on the modernisation
of the college fire systems. Mr Cox
said that some of the current
systems were of 'considerable age',
and that they were being
progressively upgraded to meet and
exceed new safety standards.
