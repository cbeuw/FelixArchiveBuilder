In March 1984 the London Times
published an article on the
'phenomenon of Athens College',
under the title 'The Secret of
Continuing Success'. The article
starts: 'Of mathematics scholarships
awarded by Trinity College this
year, three went to graduates from
Athens College. Another graduate
from the College won a top
scholarship in Physics to Balliol,
Oxford and five more leavers are
currently keeping their fingers
crossed hoping to win scholarships
at Imperial'College, London'. So
impressed was the London Times
with the results of the Athens
College graduates. But as the article
stated; the success was not
temporary but continuing. The 1984
year was neither the start nor the
end. The academic year 1985-86
was even more successful with five
students with Imperial College
scholarships. The success continues
reaching a peak in 1992 when 11
students were accepted to Oxford
and Cambridge, 8 to Imperial and
4 to the LSE to name only some of
the best universities in the U K and
undoubtedly some of the best in
Europe. The reason is easy to
understand. Only in 1990 the first
two students graduated from the
Electrical Engineering department
of Imperial College were Athens
College graduates. For the 1992
class Mrs Skillman, current head of
the G C E department, said 'This
class did superbly, the results are
probably the best in history.'
So, do not wonder if you see
Greek students walking in the
corridors or in the refectory
wearing with pride t-shirts with the
Athens College shield. And even
more the Athens College freshers
should not be surprised by the
reputation and fame that Athens
College has among the British
Universities.
But what makes Athens College
so successful?
'A combination of talented, hand-
picked teachers, a first-class G C E
department, high standards all
round, and students eager to work
harder than average'. Every year,
most of the highly selected
American universities such as the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Harvard, Standford,
Princeton, Yale, and Cornell award
scholarships to Athens College
graduates. Former American
president of Athens College, Dr
Summerskill points out: 'The
American universities know that
grades here are meaningful'.
Ever since it was founded 67
years ago by a small group of
public-spirited Athenians who were
soon joined by Americans, the
College has sought to impart 'the
finest academic training in Greece'.
Greek and American educators
joined forces in a rare experiment
of bicultural cooperation.
The College is situated on a 40
acre pine covered hill in Psychico,
north of Athens, and its main
campus contains 10 major
buildings, a chapel and 7 faculty
houses as well as vast sport
grounds, an excellent £1.3 million
theatre and the largest school library
in Greece. English is a required
subject from the age of nine and by
graduation the students must be
effectively bilingual. About one
third of the students who graduate
plan to go to British and American
Universities.
This American-sponsored school
is a non-profit organisation but the
annual fees are not small for an
average family. On the other hand,
a great number of scholarships are
given every year by teh school to
deserving students. Most of the
London-based Greek shipowners
who have their children in Athens
College are rated amongst the top
benefactors.
Despite all this, during the last
decade the College was badly
attacked by an 8-year Socialist
Government in Greece with laws
'which made life very difficult for
non-profit independent schools by
unnecessary restrictions upon
curriculum teaching materials,
personnel, policy, etc' says the
current American President Walter
McCann. Fortunately, through
careful manipulations and
cooperation, the College managed
not only to survive but to expand
over the years by up to 3,300
students.
In closing, Athens College does
not finish as soon as the students
graduates from the school. The
graduates keep in touch, help each
other and reinforce links through
activities organised by the Athens
College Alumni Association in
Greece and the US. Recently, some
important steps were make towards
the creation of an Alumni
Association in Britain.

By way of a special introduction to
Wayne's World, the first film in
FilmSoc's autumn season, the
society has employed the services
of one Wayne Nibblet Campbell,
the film's star, to give a brief
review. Over to you Wayne...
'When FilmSoc called up and
asked me to write a review I said
'no way' and they said 'way', and
I said 'no way' and they said 'noooo
waaaay' and I said 'waaaa-aaaay',
so here it is;- the story of what
happens in the most excellent movie
of all time!'
'Basically, your excellent host,
Wayne Campbell (me) and most
excellent co-host and bud Garth are
convinced by Rob Lowe, posing as
a big-time national T V magnate that
their public access T V show
'Wayne's World' (excellent) is
ready for big-name national T V .
But secretly he attempts to re-work
it into something that SUCKS so
that he can kiss butt with some big-
shot who owns a video arcade
empire.'
'In the process the sphincter also
tries to move in on Wayne's
babelicious oriental rock-singer,
Cassandra (schwing!) and virtually
destroys potential mega-stardom (of
which Wayne has always been truly
worthy) and relations between
Wayne and his chief-bud, Garth.'
'Also expect shameless product-
placement-plugs and countless
cameo appearances from a myriad
of truly excellent guest stars. Plus
three—count 'em-three alternative
endings.'
Do Wayne and Garth live to party
on another day? Find out at FilmSoc
on Thursday 15th October in Mech
Eng 220. Believe you are worthy
and enjoy!
