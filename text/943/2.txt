Welcome to Imperial College. Most
of you reading Felix for the first
time will be living in a Hall of
Residence. If this is your first time
away from your parent's home you
will probably be 'surprised' by the
standard of accommodation.
The Imperial College prospectus
proudly guarantees you a room in
its or an Intercollegiate Hall of
Residence. Although the
Intercollegiate halls are of a slightly
higher standard and offer the chance
of meeting students from other
colleges in London, they are not
situated in the South Kensington
area.
The Southside halls of residence
have been described as 'shitty'. In
recent years there have been floods
of sewage and loss of water and
power. Even when everything is
working your communal living and
cooking facilities are compact with
the theft of food from fridges
commonplace.
The Evelyn Gardens residences
vary from Fisher Hall which is
rated as positively luxurious to the
now closed Holbein House. This
hall was closed at Easter last year
with the remaining occupants turned

21. Drives crazy of French

out onto the street. Refurbishment
work did not appear to start until the
summer and it appears it will not
open until December, if then. In the
meantime we are missing 60 bed
spaces.
Even college management realise
that it is not a good idea to have a
hall closed during term time. But
with 60 people sharing one shower
and two gas rings in the basement,
any environmental health officer
would close the place down if they
saw it. College sensibly decided to
pre-empt them, but then could not
get coordinated itself to complete
the refurbishment over the summer.
So, what options does that leave
you with? You could try the private
sector. However this summer the
cost of renting a flat seems to have
increased by around 10% if you
want to be within 10 minutes
cycling distance. If you can not
afford the £60-80 for a single room
in this area, prices fall as you move
further out or south of the river into
Battersea and Clapham.
However the state of
accommodation in London and the
state of the halls of residence are
one of college's best kept secrets.
If you, or your parents, knew how
much time you would spend
worrying about accommodation,
the amounts you would pay and the
standard you would live in they
would ensure that you went to
different University at the other end
of the country where you can have
a single room in hall for around £40

While new students remain in
ignorance of the true situation, the
college will continue to have new
students.
