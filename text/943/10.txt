The Days of Guns 'n'
Roses —Appetite for
Destruction by Danny
Sugerman
Although I read and enjoyed Danny
Sugerman's previous book, 'No
One Gets Out of Here Alive', the
biography of Jim Morrison, I'm
afraid I found this work less
enthralling.
Mr Sugerman does not know any
of the 'gunners' as well as he knew
Jim Morrison and this is obvious
from the lack of details in this book
which couldn't have been picked up
in a cursory reading of the heavy
metal press. This is not an
authorised biography and it shows.
The Author tries to make up for
his lack of new facts with gushing
praise of the band (especially Axl)
and lengthy waffle comparing Axl
to Dionysus, a shaman and surprise,
surprise, old Jim Morrison himself.
His slant on the Donnington tragedy
where two fans died during the
Gn'R set, was particularly
offensive.
All in all only for the die hard
fans who must have anything with
the Gn'R name on it.

Night Fishing by Patrice
Chaplin
Patrice Chaplin's book is about life
in Bell Town, a lowlife area of
London that is inhabited by middle
class, meeja folks, as well as pimps
and junkies.
The book concentrates on three
womens' views of the events
surrounding the death of Jamie, a
middle class boy and a promising
artist, who become a drug addict.
His mother an up-and-coming
filmmaker, thinks she's in touch
with young people and runs a kind
of open-house policy but she
doesn't see what is happening to her
own son. The absentee Father,
tight-fisted, yet successful and
reputedly brilliant, is equally
ignorant.
The book is graphic and at times
disturbing, especially the
nonchalant account by Cathy, a
child prostitute, who repeatedly
denies her addiction whilst detailing
her phenomenal intake.
A well written book that draws
the reader into the seedy underlife
•of an area which the middle class
inhabitants are content to see at
face-value.

Killer in downtown—Joe
Doherty, the IRA and the
Special Relationship by
Martin Dillon
The journalistic style of this book
seems rather weighty at first but I
was soon gripped by the unfolding
storyline. This book chronicles the
events in the life of an IRA activist,
Joe Doherty, the circumstances
which lead to his arrest, his daring
escape from Crumlin Road prison
to a new identity in the USA. It
finally focuses on the lengthy series
of trials and retrials, appeals and
refusals of bail that had made a
mockery of the American justice
system for nine years.
Martin Dillon has written a very
interesting book from his privileged
position as an expert observer in the
trials. He makes full use of his
extensive knowledge of the IRA and
Northern Ireland to produce a book
which is completely accessible to
the layman without being
patronising.
Worth reading , if only for the
copy of the Green Book, (the IRA's
rules and regulations), in the
appendix.
