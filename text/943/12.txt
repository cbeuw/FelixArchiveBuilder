Felix 943 9th October 1992
Ligadollopopamudalooza
Felix went to the Reading Festival and escaped with its life.
Reading and mud. Inextricably
linked, inseparable, insufferable.
Sod it, at least the backstage toilets
are clean. Felix perks, you see,
even up to being provided with T V
screens showing all the on stage
action. Mud free viewing.
But for some bands you just have
to be there. Know what I'm saying?
Unfortunately, or perhaps
fortunately, on that first Friday
night, in a line- up strewn with
cancellations (Curve, Hiphoprisy,
etc.) the bands on that 'got- to-be'
list consist of The Wonder Stuff.
Sod the rest, if we can't have the
best, the Stuffies will have to do.
And, for most of their set, they
were, for me, the best band of the
day (Oh, wait, that's not saying
much, is it?). But, and here's the
thing, but they then brought on Vic
'n' Bob. Take note, dear Freshers,
these people are N O T funny. Also
take note that the word 'Not' is
placed in the middle of the sentence.
Placing it at the end is humourfree,
and I'll deck the first person who
does otherwise. Anyway, back to
the rather negligible plot; Vic can't
sing, and the only salvation is for
most of this drivel (which shall
remain nameless. You can probably
guess) is that he doesn't. However,
once he returns, hopefully to the
deep pit from whence he came, we
can carry on. The Wonder Stuff are
okay. At least it's not raining.
Resolving to see more bands, say
two, and with the added bonus of
sunshine, of sorts, somewhat
subduing the all pervasive mud,
noon on Saturday introduces a
brand new day with Therapy?
(Remember the question mark,
always the question mark) on the
main stage. And what an
appropriate name it is. Anti-mud,
anti-rain therapy. Wake up, time to
die, the sound of the moment is
fuckpop. Anti-hunger they're not,
however, and sighting a
Readingburger stall, I returned to
the tent.
Back in time for Thousand Yard
Stare, however. Now I've seen
Thousand Yard Stare before, but
never have they sounded so crisp,
and their songs so clear. Clean cut
and sharp, a real success.
Famous name Japanese not
include Hirohito? Why, Shonen
Knife, of course, cute (and they are
ever so cute, in their matching heart
dresses), cult, punk pop band, bring
a little light relief to the tent. (For
the uninitiated, the bands at Reading
appear on two stages; the open air
main stage, where it is wet, windy,
and muddy, and inside a small
marquee, where it is wet, windy
and muddy.)
Suddenly I'm drowning, not in
water, not even in mud, but in
popkids. Muddy popkids, but
popkids all the same. And why?
Vic Reeves: 'Funny' man.
Abnormal service will be resumed
next week.
Scorpio Rising, whatever.
Because the popkids know what the
Seattle soundalikes don't, they
know that EMF stand for Even
More Fun.
Back in shelter city, and
Sunscreem are playing. So what.
Everyone is waiting, anxiously,
avidly for Suede. Precious,
precocious, how could they fail?
With all the emotion, the
expectation invested in them, how
can they succeed? They don't, of
course. Suede, with the weight of
the next big thing firmly balanced
on their shoulders, their heads in the
clouds, their feet in the mud,
they're tortured, their twisted set is
torn apart. And they're still the only
band who moved me, emotionally,
all weekend.
Sunday morning at five o'clock as
the day begins. Inch deep in water,
it rained through the night. Mud to
my ears, and my fire just won't
light. Pissed on, pissed off. Let's
get pissed.
Variety is the spice of life. Not
today. The comedy tent has blown
away. The session tent is closed to
allow work to stop the same
happening there. So we're left with
Nirvanesque noiseniks than
Washington State. Nevermind, at
least, sandwiched in the middle,
like a (fake) diamond in the sand,
are Bjorn Again. For the unaware,
Bjorn Again are Abba, in all their
grandeur. Dancing in the slime,
singalongabjorn. This is what it's all
about. Fun (and I thought they'd
banned the f-word).
Scorpio Rising, usually a frenetic
menage a trois with heaven and
hell, suffer from having their sound
blown all around, as the newly
reopened tent claims another
victim. Can anyone British tame the
tentmonster?
Eat are on stage. The swamp
sound, in full effect, in a swamp
environment, sharp yet sticky, and
with 'Tombstone' finally burying
the festival, for myself at least. Sod
Nirvana, Eat are nirvana, I'm wet,
my sleeping bag's wet, my tent's
wet, I'm out of here.
Poddy.
9Bjorn Again play the U L U all-
nighter on 16th October. Suede play
SW1 Club on 19th October. Eat and
Scorpio Rising support PWEI
tomorrow at the Brixton Academy.
