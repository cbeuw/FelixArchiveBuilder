I hope that as many people as
possible got to read or see a copy
of Felix in their first week here. I
hope to explain here some of the
reasons behind the way Felix does
things
Financially we are not
independent from Imperial College
or its Student Union. You, the
student pays money to the College,
who then give the Union money,
part of which funds the production
of Felix. Because, we are a fairly
large operation we have to add to
this money by advertising revenue.
We are very lucky, many other
student newspapers have to fund
their entire production with
advertising, we do not, because of
the Union contributions.
Another tradition is that Felix is
editorially independent of the
Union. This makes any comment
we make untainted, or sanitised to
ensure the Union or College gets the
best publicity. As soon as one
person starts to dictate what Felix
does, in any small way, that
integrity is fatally compromised.
It is hardly surprising that there
are times when the Union wants to
control what Felix does. At the
moment, we are being dictated to
about how we should run
advertising, a major source of the
money that keeps Felix afloat.
Mandy Hurford, the Union
Felix 943
Manager, is upset about a leaflet
that was delivered to all the Halls
as part of Felix last Saturday. On
the leaflet was a plug for an event
this week, which is sponsored by
the bookstore, Dillons. The leaflet
was delivered free, in return for
entrance to the event by one of our
photographers. Mandy believes that
this tiny plug for Dillons will drag
business away from the Imperial
College Union Bookstore.
Any student knows that the ICU
Bookstore is cheaper and more
convenient than any Dillons store
and stocks texts that are relevant to
Imperial College students and staff.
Anyone in their right mind would
be educationally challenged to
choose anywhere else. But if
Imperial College Union Bookstore
want to become a going financial
concern it must learn to compete in
the same market place as other
chain book stores. Placing of
advertising is part of that market
place.
What I object to is the Union
thinking that they can run Felix's
advertising. If any bookstore wants
to give Felix money for advertising
I will not complain. We run
advertising for restaurants, is this
not in competition with the Union
snack bar? No one voiced a
complaint about last weeks
Wagamama competition. The
Opinion
9th October 1992
College Bar and Q T have also
advertised, not a peep was heard out
of the Union then. Should we
consult with the Union about every
potentially controversial advertising
offer? Never, besides being
impossible to manage, were would
it end? Soon we would be run lock,
stock and barrel by the Union. Most
of all, when the Union makes
decisions that affect Felix we are
rarely consulted, why should we
consult them about how to do our
job?
