Alzheimer team gain
Charity rings
The Barclay Foundation has
donated £800,000 to Alzheimer
research at St. Mary's Hospital.
The grant, made to Dr. J. Collinge,
is the sum that was promised by the
Barclay Foundation in January to
save Alzheimer research at St.
Mary's. The research was
threatened earlier this year by the
departure of Dr John Hardy's team
Alumni fund
to the United States. In widely
reported comments, Dr Hardy's
team said that they were leaving
Britain as research scientists were
not properly valued in this country.
In other developments, the Cystic
Fibrosis Trust has donated
£1,000,000 to cystic fibrosis gene
therapy research.
The Royal Association for
Disability and Rehabilitation
(RADAR) is asking the public to
donate their telephone coinbox
change to charity. R A D A R says
that up until this week, members of
the public had no choice other than
to lose any unused money retained
by the coinbox. They are now
asking coinbox users to press the
'follow on' call button after their
call, and dial 0891 444 555.
Retained coins will be donated to
RADAR.
Assertiveness
The College Development office
are about to embark on phase 2 of
their 1992 Annual Fund, and are
looking for students to work on
their 'telethon' campaign. Students
will be paid at least £4 per hour to
solicit contributions by telephone
from 500 college Alumni. The
fund, which has already raised
£68,000, is hoping to raise a total
of £100,000. Students will be asked
to work 13 hours per week,
including one weekend shift, and
will have to undergo a selection test
and two training sessions before
they begin. All enquiries to the
Development Office, room 3.01a in
the Sherfield Building.

Masters update
The Stuart Masters Trust is
moving closer to its target figure of
£380,000. The money is required
to send three year old Stuart to
Pittsburgh for a life saving liver and
bowel transplant. Local fundraising
is being organised by Tony Etienne
of Imperial's biochemistry
department. M r Etienne has so far
raised £1,600, and says that the
fund is now just £90,000 short of
the target. Appealing for donations
at Imperial, he told Felix, 'every
little bit helps'.
Council tax
The Government has announced
special student arrangements for the
Council Tax, which replaces the
Poll Tax in April 1993. Under the
arrangements, a house occupied
solely by students will be exempt
from the tax. This includes halls of
residence, student hostels and
private flats and houses where all
the occupants are students.
The council tax is set by local
authorities to pay for local services,
and there is one bill per house. The
tax is based on eight 'valuation
bands', and assumes that two
council tax payers occupy each
house. Students will not be counted
as council tax payers.
If two adults live in a house, and
one is a student, the tax bill will be
reduced by 25%. A student is
defined under the legislation as
someone attending a course lasting
at least one year, and involving 21
hours of study a week for 24 weeks
each year. Students on industrial
placement as part of their course are
also exempt from the tax.
A new leaflet explaining the tax
has been issued by the Department
of the Environment. The leaflet
states that until the introduction of
the Council Tax in April 1993, the
poll tax must still be paid by
Community Charge payers.
Ministerial announcement confuses issue
by Declan Curry
There has been a muted response
to the much flagged Government
announcement on voluntary
membership for student unions.
John Patten, the Secretary of State
for Education, told this week's
Conservative Party Conference that
'the NUS (National Union of
Students) closed shop must go, and
soon.'
The announcement follows
several months of unofficial
ministerial consultation on student
union membership. At present, all
members of a college or university
are automatically members of the
campus student union. If the
campus union decides to join the
NUS, then all campus union
members are also NUS members.
Under voluntary membership for
campus unions, students would
decide either to leave or join the
campus union, and automatically
the NUS, if affiliated.
Mr Patten was speaking at the
Conservative Conference debate on
education. During the debate, there
were calls for the full introduction
of voluntary membership for all
unions. In recent weeks,
Conservative Students had
increasingly demanded root and
branch reform of union
membership. Last weekend, several
national press journalists were told
that a radical shake up would be
announced by Mr Patten.
The Secretary of State told the
delegates that it had always been an
aim of the Conservative Party to
'preserve and extend personal
liberty and freedom of choice'. He
accepted that in a free country, it
was the privilege of students to be
active in the NUS, though he asked
why the taxpayer should pay for
'the few who get involved in
supporting dubious causes of no
interest to ' other students'. The
Education Secretary then
announced that he would 'bring
forward proposals to establish the
voluntary principle as the basis for
student union membership.'
During his speech, Mr Patten did
not detail how he would establish
the voluntary principle, nor did he
indicate when he would bring
forward his proposals. Speaking to
the BBC after his speech, he said
that he would announce further
details around Christmas. A
spokeswoman for the Department
for Education said that there would
be a 'small pause' between the end
of consultations and further
Government action.
The Education Secretary's
announcement is similar to other
statements of intent made by
previous Education Secretaries. In
all previous cases, the ministers
concerned encountered fatal
difficulties in trying to frame the
necessary legislation. Weekend
newspaper reports said that Mr
Patten had 'cleared the hurdles' on
restricting the activities of the NUS.
No indication was given of this in
M r Patten's speech to the
conference.
The Education Secretary's
comments were dismissed by the
NUS. which said that there was
nothing new in the speech. Lorna
Fitzsimons, the NUS president, said
that 'it has always been our aim as
a confederation of student unions to
preserve and extend choice and
freedom of expression', adding that
'the N U S maintains that the
voluntary membership principle
already exists.'
Earlier in the week, Ms
Fitzsimons claimed that the NUS
had become more Thatcherite in
outlook. Speaking on STOIC,
Imperial's student television, she
said that student unions providing
commercial services were an
example of free enterprise and
entrepreneurship. Senior NUS
figures are privately, suggesting that
the junior education minister, Nigel
Forman, promised to put the
voluntary membership issue 'on the
long finger' by greatly extending
the consultation period. They
further imply that M r Forman
favours the retention of compulsory
membership for campus student
unions. Speaking in the House of
Commons in June, Mr Forman said
that 'the principle of freedom of
association would suggest that
students should have' the right to
join together to form an
organisation to undertake functions
to meet their legitimate needs'.
