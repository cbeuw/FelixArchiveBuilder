EDITORIAL
Here it is, the last Felix before all that Christmas fare
makes I.C. sportsmen (and women) horribly unfit for next
term's University competitions! Let's hope this will not be
the case as L C should reap the harvest of this term's work
next year in no mean fashion.
It is pleasing to see so many different sports represented
here this week — and also such good results. However not
only good results should be reported but also the many un-
rewarded efforts of so many people that go on every week.
Last week's B.U.S.F. Badminton Championships did not
bring to I.C. the medals they expected. Nervousness played
a big part in last year's women's singles champion Lynne
Benyon being defeated in the third round. However Sue
Thompson and she reached the final of the Ladies Doubles
to take the silver medal. As expected S. K. Donald and
G. A. Georgiou reached the men's doubles final but were
surprisingly beaten. Still, such is competitive sport with its
peaks of heady glory and depths of' bitter disappointment.
In contrast of fierce competition, I must mention the
2 constituent college Rugby Seven-a-side competitions which
have been held on the previous two Sundays. In the C +
G sevens, Chem Eng III took the First Cup (and 8 galls
of beer!) and the result of the RCS Sevens were not avail-
able at the time of going to press. (Could be Chem III tho' !)
These are tremendously social occasions not too many people
worrying too much about the rugby. They are also good
ways of getting to know people in your year better, i.e. has
he got knobbly knees and can he dispose of the beer prizes
before other vultures descend?
Badminton
Despite tohe recent disappointment in the finals of the
British Universities Championship in all, the men's toeams
are haiving a good season, as are the mixed and ladies teams.
The first team has ;
in fact a perfect record of six wins out of
six games.
The photograph shows M . Roberts and D. Evans play-
ing first pair for I.C. II against Chelsea which L C won by
6-3.
WATER POLO
I.C. lst team won tohe U . L . Handicap Knock-Out
tournament last week (26 Nov.) for the first time in nine
years by beating I.C. (II) in a close and exciting final. In
tohe five matches that they played tohe first team conceded
only four goals, three of which were in the final. The second
team did very well to reach ithe final, beating a strong St.
Mary's Hospital team in the semi-final with a good goal in
the last minute. This year's strength is to a large part the
result of the hard work put in last year by the Captain
(John McGarrity) and Coach (Cliff Spooner) in teaching
the many novices in the club. There has also been an influx
of experienced players this year and under Peter Mc-
Cartney's captaincy tohe club should do very well intoheU . L .
leagues held next term, for which we hope to enter three
teams. If this is too continue in tohe future we need more new
members tohis year who are keen too play water polo.
Also this year the first team have registered victories
over Glactoon, United London Hospitals and Bristol Univer-
Siity. In the only swimming match so far we lost to a strong
Oxford University team but beat Bristol.
