As you can see the at-
tempt to 'write' on the side
of LJnsltead and Southside
was relatively successful.
The letter L had a grand

interview the dolly birds.

most of them came from
I.F. and not a skirt from
I.C. Maimmiferous president
Judith Walker was seen to
arrive but declined the offer
of entering.
After a measure of groan-
ing from the male members
of the audience, the panel,
which included two persons
from the staff of I.F. and
I.C's one and only M r .
Carl Seaford, reached their
decision.
With the atmosphere like
ithalt in a Miss World final,
Rob announced the results:
Barbara Borgars of I.F. won
the fifteen pounds prize and
became Ithis year's Carnival
Queen. Runner-up was
Claire Makin, who won a
bottle of wine. For their
services the panel were also
awarded a bottle of wine
each. So overcome was
Barbara that she was pre-
pared to take the booby
prize too — Carl Seaford,
(see right). I.F. lias no bar
but a temporary one was
installed for the dance —
the beer flowed plentifully,

Three of the walkers, about to begin their gruelling marathon
humour flagging upon reach-
ing Queensgate, quickly re-
fortified themselves With lots
of whisky (fashionable must
for C C presidente these
days). 'Still, it's a l in
a good cause,' we muttered.
Alt time of writing, how
much will be collected for
the cause is difficult to dis-
cern. However, almost 150
people completed it and one
Wise guy was sponsored for
