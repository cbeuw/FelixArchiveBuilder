Letters to the editor
Something Cooking Wrong way
The Editor,
'Felix,'
Imperial College Union
Sir,
The other day we happened to chance upon a few recent
copies of your newspaper. We were, to say the least, dis-
turbed by recent developments in Imperial College. Both as
recent graduates and taxpayers, we felt it to be our duty to
beg the courtesy of your columns to make certain timely
comments upon the current distressing state of affairs.
We would like to remind Mr. Cooke that the student union
fees are provided by the taxpayer. Is it, then, too much to ask
that the taxpayer should have a voice in the use of this
money, which M r . Cooke seems to regard as his?
Does he seriously think that we pay our taxes solely for
the entertainment of students? No, we pay student grants in
the hope of achieving some benefit for the nation (and, in-
deed, the empire) thereby. In our day, students were in the
forefront of the struggle for freedom, equality and democracy
at home and abroad. Where are they now? They are in in-
dustry earning money so that the struggle can continue via
policital work on all fronts.
We pay our taxes, we pay your grants, why aren't you
bloody well out on the streets, demonstrating? A h , that it
should come to this!
We remain,
Yours etc.,
J. Martin Bland, M.Sc, D.I.C., A.R.C.S., F.S.S.
D. V . Wield, B.Sc., A.R.C.S., Grad. Inst. P., O.B.E. (failed)
or burning.
Sir,
Under the heading 'the cultural revolution' the writer
makes some comment about students despairing at voting a
lefty back for a second year. This is certainly not true. The
R.C.S. president is merely airing his own opinion (and per-
haps his cronies' too). However he may rest assured that no-
one in his right mind would ever vote the present R.C.S.
president back to his useless post for a second year. He also
makes it clear that he is not as concerned about the mental
state of the student here, as he, is about the reputation of
the college abroad. It is a shame he couldn't make it to
Oxford or some such 'reputable' place, but then I suppose
someone with his selfish attitudes shouldn't expect any better.
Perhaps he needs a 'reviver' of some sort. It is painfully ob-
vious that he is politically impotent; the potential of the
college as a policital hammer to straighten out kinks in the
system must be realised and not scorned at.
It is our duty as the 'educated' minority in society to assist
in correcting political issues if they are morally wrong. The
I.C. Union does not exist for the students entertainment—
that's what the constituent college unions are there for.
The writer also seems incredibly ignorant about the N.U.S.
If he ever bothers to read 'Times Educational Supplement',
he will find that the name Jack Straw is rather well known
by people actually interested in education. Jack Straw's ideas
on reform in the educational and political sphere are re-
spected and respect is something Steve Cooke will never get
on the R.C.S. stage.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,
I am an atheist and there-
fore, presumably, one of the
people the recent 'One Way'
campaign has been aimed at.
The following comments are
by way of a constructive
criticism to enable any future
efforts along the same lines
to be more effective and less
offensive.
Leaving aside for a
moment the philosophy
guiding the campaign, the
publicity side of it, which is
both the first and in many
cases the only contact made
with the student body, was
less than totally professional.
This would not matter so
much were it not that the
campaign was obviously set-
ting itself high standards
(worthy of printed posters,
for instance). But while we
were assailed from all sides
with these neat, expensive
pictures, the actual content
was doubtful. 'One Way'? A
neat gimmick; one hopes.
And is it really intelligent to
expect non-believers to be
'enlightened' by quotes from
a book of sectarian gospels
they have already rejected?
Then there was the alienation
produced by excessive publi-
city, which I.C.C.U. must
have realised by the end.
Next time, less and better
please.
The choice of 'One Way' as
the theme may not have been
very good. I accept (reluc-
tantly) that some people are
not only sure that their way
is the only one way, but that
they have a duty to convert
others to it. Blandly stating
that they have the key to all
unfathomable mysteries, and
that all other claims to this
are false, with all the Calvin-
istic fire and brimstone that
this implies, will appear to
the infidel as unspeakable ar-
rogance. When persuading, it
helps if you appreciate the
opponent's own views, even
—dare I suggest it—to the
extent of conceding that there
may be something in them.
I remain, Sir, respeetf ul of
the personal beliefs of others,

Dear Sir,
Without doubt many of
your readers will have been
nauseated by the spurious,
and totally unscientific, racial
views expressed by B . Hol-
lins in the last edition of
F E L I X . Many will have been
reminded by his perverted
reasoning of Hitler's views,
equally unscientific, about
Aryan superiority. A t best
Hollins' abberations can be
described as a form of mad-
ness.
Of more interest must be
the question of how your
correspondent could have
been reduced to such a level.
I would dare to suggest he is
the victim of false ideologies
which are coming increasing-
ly into vogue in this country.
Two such ideologies were
well presented in the same
issue of your paper. The
materialist idea that money
is the only thing of value in
this world and that personal
relationships should be ruled
by financial considerations, a
view vital to the survival of
technological capitalism, was
persuasively peddled by
Steve Cooke in his 'Cultural
Revolution." The second pre-
sentation, although obviously
well meant may be equally as
damaging. Geoff Needham
is obviously sincere in his
' A Humanist Point of View'
but could it be that negativ-
ism often to be found in Bri-
tish Humanism has under-
mined the Christian ethic. In
particular the Christian be-
lief that all men are equal in
the sight of God is a power-
ful corrective to the madness
of M r . Hollins' prp*apar-
theid group, who seem to
regard one group of men as
just a particularly useful spe-
cies of animal.
Yours faithfully,
Les Ebdon,
Chem. P.G.

Dear Sir,
Mr. Hollins' letter in the
last issue of F E L I X was de-
finitely the creation of a sub-
lime intellect. The brilliant
logic much in evidence
throughout this circumspect
and right-minded analysis de-
fies description. His well sub-
stantiated statements especi-
ally those about 'Satchmo'
and 'Indian hockey teams' as
well as poignant analogies
about lions and zebras' add-
ed spice to the missive. The
language was rather zesty
throughout and clumsy
phraseology and inept puctu-
ation cleverly avoided. After
all, every war in history (ex-
cept Civil ones) have been
foreigners fighting people.
If I was the editor of
F E L I X , I would certainly
agitate to get this perspica-
cious gentleman to edit a
regular column entitled
'Racism can be Fun' (but
surely our imaginative friend
could think up a better
title).

EDITORIAL
Despite difficulties and crises met daily by FELIX staff, we're
still here, returning this issue with stacks of free gifts and goodies.
I trust these will warm the hearts of (those Who have recently
held a lot of criticism for the paper. And here, for all to see, is
a potted defence of this issue:—
(1) Why is there so much space devoted to Carnival? (a) Carnival
is one of the few "good" Causes alive in the 'College (besides OSS),
(lb) it can involve everyone in the College, (c) Carnival realise
the value of publicity, and consequently make sure we get plenty
of material.
(2) Why is there so much free gunge and so little news? It's
Christmas and nothing's happened.
Back to reality, the editor welcomes any constructive criticisms,
schemes to improve and change FELIX. Did you think the front
page of this issue was a good idea, for example? I may be con-
tacted at 432 Tizard or at any press meeting, but please remember—
try and keep political dogmatism from spoiling your ideas.
When considered as a whole, last Thursday's Union meeting
accomplished very little. The effectiveness of such meetings to
decide basic issues Which really concern the Union appears to be
rapidly decreasing. Two thirds of the allotted time was spent dis-
cussing a motion which even Piers Corbyn, the proposer, could
not 'have thought had a fair chance of being passed. I'nough l am
not speaking against the motion as such, worded as it was, it
immediately had an overwhelming block of voters, typified by Terry
Stephenson, against it Between them, they are wasting too much
of the Union's time.
lust as effective in disrupting the meeting are characters who
insist on shouting for order or propose paper 'ballots, of Which
there is surely little point unless personal allegiances are involved.
The Constitution and Standing Orders are tools to promote intelli-
gent discussion and should not 'bog us down in time-wasting pro-
cedural trivia.
P A R A N O I A
Dear Sir,
Spare me space to answer
your correspondent B. Hol-
lins letter. On analysing it, I
found it to be most illogical
and seemed to be the work of
a paranoic mind. (I am an
Aston University undergradu-
ate doing my industrial train-
ing in London, and in the
past have written frequent
articles on racism for the
University paper, 'The Sun').
How can one condone
apartheid when in South
Africa as a direct result of
this inhumane and diabolical
doctrine, 50% of the black
children die before the age of
five, and the life expectancy
of a black African is 34
years.
To say that whites and
blacks cannot integrate is
sheer nonsense. One only has
to look at Holland where
the Dutch have absorbed
180,000 S.E. Asians (blacks)
into their society without the
emergence of 'Powellism' or
should I say 'Hollinism'. To
quote Julie Tweed of the
Guardian, who visited Hol-
land, 'In Holland a marriage
between a black and a white
is a marriage and not an
intermarriage.'
He further argues that
'whites' are more intelligent
than blacks.' This is merely
a racialist cliche—there are
no statistics available. Un-
fortunately his paranoic
mind fails to grasp the idea
that one's I.Q. depends
largely on sociological fac-
tors, not on the pigmentation
of one's skin; and further-
more one's pigmenation is
purely due to geographical
factors. To use India as an
example to illustrate the
point; the Indians living in
Kashmir, where it snows
virtually all the year round,
are as 'white' as Europeans
if not 'whiter'. In the south
where there is oppressive
heat all the year round, the
Indians are very dark.
In fact, although Kash-
miri's are white, with all re-
spect to them, they are the
dullest among the Indians
purely because they shrink
from civilisation. Further it
will be valid to assume that
the Eskimos in spite of their
white skin will have the same
I.Q. as the Africans, and an
Asiatic will have a higher
I.Q. than them both purely
because of sociological rea-
sons. (Just for the record, the
average Asiatic brain has
nineteen million brain cells
and an average British brain
has seventeen million brain
cells).
It is surprising that an I.C.
student would have to faSJ
back to the absurd cliche
'quite a number among them
are spongers on society,' be-
cause surveys on racism have
shown this to be a myth.
Finally with reference to his
idea of first and second class
citizenship, how unfair it
would be for two persons
making the same contribution
to society to be given differ-
ent status in the same soci-
ety simply because of their
colour.
The analogy he uses, 'a
lion and a zebra' is absurd. I
wonder how violently he
would object if he saw a
black stallion and a white
mare copulating. Even if he
objected, the white mare
wouldn't particularly be in-
terested in his 'superior' sense
of reasoning.
The essence of a society
should be humanity not apar-
theid.
Yours faithfully,
Javed S. Khan,
