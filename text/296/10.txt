UNION MEETING
Harry FaiYbroTlieir
Geoff Needham, having
taken the minutes as read,
proceeded with the corres-
pondence. A letter had been
received about Oxfam col-
lections in local pubs and
another bringing notice of an
anti-apartheid petition, which
could be signed by members
of the union.
A t 1.10 p.m., Ken Weale
had not arrived to give the
annual union accounts, so
Geoff moved the meeting on-
to the first motion. This
was proposed by George
Assimakis; "No resident
should ever be punished for
not informing the Warden of
an offence that another resi-
dent has committed." A logi-
cal and humanitarian argu-
ment put most of the meeting
on George's side, and the
motion was passed over-
whelmingly.
Accounts
After a general acceptance
from the floor, Ken Weale
went on to present the un-
ion accounts. The Union has
a cash balance of just over
£1,000, £12,000 in negotiable
assets and total assets of ap-
proximately £31,000. Fur-
ther details and a break-
down of last year's income
and expenses are posted up
around the college. The
only query was from Ken
Heron who was concerned
that £229 was spent in send-
ing delegates to N.U.S. con-
ference Dave Hobman
answered that if people
weren't sent then we were
wasting our time being
members of the NUS.
Piers
Second motion to be pre-
sented was one from Piers
Corbyn; an incredibly long
and diverse motion support-
ing the Dec 8th strike. Terry
Stephenson immediately pro-
posed that the motion be not
put. Geoff asked Piers to sub-
stantiate the motion which
he did so, and the chair de-
cided that the motion was
to be put. After Piers'
lengthy proposal, John M c -
Cullough suggested that the
motion be taken in three
parts concerning (1) I C U
declares support (2) Vicious
attack on British workers
(3) Students strike.
Lost
Property
Many items of property,
some fairly valuable, are
handed into the security
office after having been
found on the College cam-
pus. Many such items are
not claimed by the losers
and are eventually returned
to the persons who found
them. Any student or mem-
ber of staff losing property
should contact the security
office, room 163 College
Block (extn. 2741).
Carnival Walk
This year's 26 mile round
trip via Harrow took place
on the night/morning of
27th/28th November. 150
intrepid walkers did a great
job, collecting just over
£1,050 for Carnival, and a
few blisters for themselves
into the bargain.
Now, to continue this suc-
cess, I ask all walkers to read
their Walk Sheet 3 and send
us a cheque or postal order
for the sum for which they
were sponsored B E F O R E
the end of term (pre-dated
to the beginning of next
term if need be) and made
payable to "Imperial Col-
lege Carnival Account".
Cheques or postal orders
can be handed in at the Car-
nival Office (by steps near
Union Bar), and Constituent
College Union Office, I.C.
Union Office or to me (517
Linstead).
KOLLIN
You are plagued with a
problem, you don't know
what to do. Well here is the
answer, Write in to K o m -
forting Kollin your Marjory
Proops of that well known
literary edition " F E L I X " !
No matter what the prob-
lem, be it large or small,
Komforting Kollin will use
his expert knowledge to pro-
vide you with a full answer
complete with pornographic
details.
Yours in anticipation,
K O L L I N ,

George Assi
Will Honeybourne pro-
posed throwing out the
motion but was too late to
get any support. Harry Fair-
brother, head of the T U in
the college, spoke on the
motion and showed that he
was in favour of taking the
motion in parts. Support the
first part, he said, and then
decide for yourself. But con-
fusion over the various parts
reduced the meeting to a
makis speaks
shambles, one that was never
really put in order. A call
was made for a proper bal-
lot; the chairman was forced
to organise a vote to suspend
standing orders and the bal-
lot was thrown out. Piers
continued to sum up but
now with McCullough's
motion. A vote was taken.
The motion was overwhelm-
ingly defeated.
