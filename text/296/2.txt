REFECTORY The St. Mungo Community
TROUBLE?
The Rector's special re-
view of Refectories last Fri-
day was not so much of a
review of services as a dis-
cusson of the sudden and
unexpected financial crisis
facing the Refectories.
The 15% price increase
at the start of term has al-
ready been absorbed by a
steep increase in food prices,
and the Refectories are now
running ait a loss, esti-
mated as amounting ito
£10,000 over the coming
year. The Rector announced
that the College (and the
UGC!!) could not tolerate
another loss of the magni-
tude of last year's whacking
£28,000.
Mr. Mooney said that
despite attempts to improve
the efficiency of the Refec-
tories, and bulk food buying
in co-operation with other
London Colleges, the only
alternatives he could see
were either to increase prices
by 5% or else close the
Union cafeteria and / or
Southside Staff Dining Room
(though he later said that in
his opinion A L L the Refec-
tories were needed).
After nearly two hours
discussion, the meeting got
nowhere, and the Rector
said that much though every-
one disliked the idea, and
unpopular though it would
be, he could see no alterna-
tive at present to a price in-
crease. He asked everyone
to think of ways to avoid
this before his next special
meeting next term.
No doubt many of you who were here last year will re-
member the centre page spreads in Sennet and suchlike publi-
city, given to the St. Mungo Community. (For those w|hoi
don't know, this is an organisation that provides a form of
social contact with the 'dosser' of London, the old man or
woman that you will see sleeping on a bench in a park, \pr
rummaging around in the dustbin looking for something to
eat). What has been happening since then?
In the first instance the size of the community has trebled,
there is a regular soup run to the East End as well as to the
West End and Charing Cross embankment, and there are now
four houses to provide accommodation of sorts to a few of
those found on the soup run. A shop selling second-hand
goods (a la Oxfam) has been opened up ait 300 'Battersea
Park Road.
It is now envisaged to conduct a thorough survey of the
Southwark area to find out just how many people there are
sleeping rough. This will entail a detailed search of all the
derelict buildings in the area, carting off the seriously ill to
hospital and informing the police of any corpses that we find.
The essentially brief meetings on the soup run cannot form
sufficient contact to influence the most isolated down-and-
outs, those who have succumbed to utter hopelessness. To
cater for this group an all night shelter is to be opened.
Now we come to the nitty-gritty of this article. Although
the actual soup run is fully manned, there is a vast number
of auxiliary jobs that need to be done that are being neglec-
ted due to lack of manpower. These jobs include collecting
coffee cups, shoes and old clothes, mending large tears in these
clothes, going tin-rattling in the pubs and so on. We have
some help from Maria Assumpta, but there is still a lot to
do. If you feel that you would be interested in partaking in
any of this, whether lor an hour per week or a day per week,
then please contact me as soon as possible, further details
will be given without any obligation on your part.
On Tuesday, December 8th, at 6.00 p.m. in EE408, the
'World in Action' film of the St. Mungo Community will be
shown. This will be followed by coffee and general chit-chat
with St. Mungo and I.C. social workers in the Elec. Eng.
Senior Common Room (EE606). Please make an effort to
come and see the film, with friend(s) if possible, even if you
decide that you cannot afford the time to take a real part in
the Community organisation, just the seeing of the film will
point out a ldt about this land fit for hereos to live in' of
which you were probably unaware.

Students from the London
Film School were recently
filming in the squash courts
between Weeks and Lin-
stead. This was part of the
first of their first year pro-
jects, to make a three minute
black and white film without
synchronised sound and the
usual sophistications of pro-
fessional film making, and
limited to only nine minutes
of film copy. The London
Film School is quickly gain-
ing an excellent reputation
in the profession, employing
many leading film makers on
its staff, and there are regular
screenings of work of the
School's students at the
National Film Theatre.

Dear Sirs,
I feel it is necessary that,
in my capacity as Stunt Offi-
cer for Carnival, I should
humbly apologise for the
lack of "happenings" on the
Carnival Walk.
Anticipating the need for
both physical and mental re-
freshment for the walkers as
they progressed on their long
and arduous adventure, I
had arranged for a hot dog
stand, complete with refri-
gerated cocktail cabinet, T.V.
lounge, sauna bath and
superloo, to be pushed
around the course of the
walk.
Unfortunately, in my folly,
I had not anticipated the
possible failure of the com-
pany with whom I was doing
business to_turn up with the
damn thing!
Yours etc.,
Robert McKilliam.
