President Vivake B h a l l a .
The meeting had been
called at last week's 08JV1C
when a motion of no-confi-
dence in M r Bhalla was pre-
sented, but as the President
was not present, the deci-
sion w a s d e l a y e d .
However, the motion was
not d e b a t e d this week
eithet as the meeting began
with the reading of a letter
of resignation from M r
Bhalla.
In his letter, M r Bhalla
explained that he felt he
had been unable to fulfil his
role as Guilds President.
"Both this term and last I
have had to take long
absences for family reasons.
1 had hoped that Guilds was capa-
ble of continuing for this period
without m y daily presence...this
appears not to have been the
c a s e . . . M y absence from College is
set to continue, meaning that 1 a m
direction it needs."
M r Bhalla's resignation has been
widely accepted as the best way to
safeguard C & G U for the future.
Speaking to Felix, Andy Heeps, IC
Union President, described the
move as "the only sensible step for-

ahead for M r Bhalla's successors

Plans have been unveiled this week
for the expansion of dBs, the Union
Ents R o o m , to take advantage of
the space that will become avail-
able in Beit Q u a d once the Biology
Department move into the new
Biomedical Sciences building this
s u m m e r . The intention of the
design is to increase the total
capacity of the Union facility, to
a c c o m m o d a t e the new medical
students, and to turn dBs into a
stand-alone facility, with its o w n
food outlets, bar and increased
stage area. The design also incor-
porates a second bar to be located
in the basement of Beit Hall.
The full plan has yet to get the
final go-ahead, pending a detailed
costing by the designers - a team
from the IC Estates Department -
but the basic concept has been
agreed and building work is set to
begin in mid-June, allowing the full
renovation to be completed by the
start of the new academic year.
The plan, as it presently stands,
involves knocking d o w n the walls
separating dBs from the Felix office
and Print Unit, to create a much
larger space which stretches into
the back corner of the Union build-
ing. Also included are the neces-
sary extra toilets and fire exits
which an increase in capacity will
require.
The d e v e l o p m e n t forms the
first phase in the forthcoming over-
hall of the Union Building outlined
last year by Eric Allsop in his mastet
plan.
A final decision on the develop-
ment, together with detailed plans
should be made by the end of
M a r c h for presentation to union
officers and staff.
