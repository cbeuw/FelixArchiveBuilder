Arab Soc Fight
TONY OFORI
Three groups of security guards
were called to restrain an angry
crowd as a large scale fight broke
out in the Sherfield building after an
altercation over a mobile phone.
The incident happened t w o weeks
ago in the early hours of Saturday
morning. Following an Arabian
Society function, t w o students
began arguing over the possession
of the phone, and this escalated
when friends joined in. Punches
were thrown before college securi-
ty and Union stewards intervened
to diffuse the situation. Clubsec, a
security firm contracted by the
Union, were also brought in a n d
the parties involved were led off
campus in opposite directions.
However, the dispute d i d not
end here. With emotions running
high the t w o groups met again in
Exhibition R o a d where fighting
once more broke out. The violence
was such that the police wete
called in, but the group soon dis-
persed and no arrests were made.
College security passed o n what
they knew to the police, but due to
the quick exit of the t w o sides not
much information could be gath-
ered. It is suspected that gang war-
fare could have played a part in the
confrontation, but the Arabian
Society's president M a r w a Hamour
insists that "the incident has been
blown o u t of p r o p o r t i o n " . The
police are reluctant to comment
because the incident is currently
under investigation.
