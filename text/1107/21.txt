IC Radio is running a competition in which you could win £50 of
music. All you have to do is design a new logo for the station.
The winning entry will be used in a new range of merchandise,
as well as for liaison with record companies. The logo must be
original, contain the words 'IC Radio 999AM', and can be in
colour, although it must be clearly reproducible in black and
white. It must also portray the station as being eclectic,
professional and dynamic.
