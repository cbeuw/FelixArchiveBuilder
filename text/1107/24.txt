No 2: Game Show Puzzler
Congratulations! C o m e on d o w n !
The price is right! Yes, in this
week's puzzle y o u are the lucky
winner of a game show.
Well almost - there's just one
more round between y o u and the
grand prize of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 . Here's
how it works:
In front of y o u are three sim-
ilarly garish boxes. In one Of
these, you are told, is the cash. In
the other two are booby prizes
(The Spice Girl box set. Urgh.)
"Pick a box!" c o m m a n d s your
host, M r Bruce Kelly. You d o so.
"I tell you what", says the host,
"I'll make it easier for you to win.
I'm going to open one of the
boxes containing a booby prize!"
He opens one of the two boxes
y o u have not chosen, and sure
enough, there are the evil C D s .
" N o w , I'm going to give you a
second chance - which box is it
going to be?!" (Game show hosts
always have '!' at the end of
every sentence). The Question is:
Should you change boxes, or
keep your original selection?
The solution to puzzle 1 106 (The Green Monks) is seven, all
of w h o m leave on the seventh day. Top marks to Richard
Bossart, Barry Gale &. Tan Swee Heng, w h o were all correct.
Mail or e-mail your answers to the Felix office (felix@ic.ac.uk). If you
are correct, your name will be printed in a blaze of glory next week.
Contributions of similar logic / maths puzzles gratefully received (with
solutions please!)
