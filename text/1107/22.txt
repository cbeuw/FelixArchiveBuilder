n &. Out is a c o m e d y inspired by
T o m Hanks' Philadelphia Oscar
acceptance speech, in which he
accidentally outed his gay high
school teacher. In the big screen
version of events, it is M a t t Dillon
as C a m e r o n Drake w h o s e message
of gratitude calls into question the
sexuality of his o l d teacher H o w a r d
Brackett, played by Kevin Kline.
What's more, H o w a r d is about to
marry Emily (Cusack), his fiancee of
some three years, that very week.
In &. Out actively tries to distance
itself from H o l l y w o o d 'issue' films
and, left in no doubt that the
situation is to be played solely for
laughs, w e are t r a n s p o r t e d to
Greenleaf, Indiana to witness the
effect o n H o w a r d a n d his i m p e n d -
ing marriage. The residents of the
small t o w n in America's heartland
are initially sceptical, but the seeds
of doubt have been s o w n . M r
Brackett always dresses so neatly,
and he d o e s adore Barbara
Streisand. A n d so d o all gay m e n ,
don't they? O f course, Emily is in no
F I L M C O M P E T I T I O N
doubt that her husband to be is
hiding nothing. Then again, it has
been an unusually long
engagement, and yet their physical
relationship hasn't progressed far

beyond holding hands in front of
the TV. It's not only his friends a n d
family w h o are studying his every
m o v e , as America's l o w b r o w
media descend o n Greenleaf in
search of a story. A m o n g them is
Peter M a l l o y (Selleck) a
h o m o s e x u a l journalist w h o
attempts to befriend H o w a r d for
the sake of an interview.
W e are used to seeing Kevin Kline
in somewhat unhinged roles, s o it
is a relief that he doesn't overplay
his character's c a m p leanings. It is
difficult to fault his performance as
a m a n desperately trying to 'bloke'
up his prissy image. The film is
served well by its supporting cast,
particularly the female characters.
Joan Cusack is very g o o d as the
devoted Emily, whose self esteem
is dented further by recent devel-
opments. However, the film is so
desperate to remain within the
bounds of political correctness that
most of the reactions to the outed
H o w a r d are fairly predictible a n d
safe. In &. Out is well executed to a
point, but any charm it m a y have is
o v e r s h a d o w e d by the truly
appalling finale. D

TWIN TOWN
Billed as the Welsh Trainspotting, (Sheepspotting
perhaps?) this is a tale of Swansea life centred
around sex a n d d o p e . The unlikely heroes are the
Lewis twins, w h o spend their lives stealing cars,
discussing football a n d exacting revenge o n anybody
w h o crosses their d a d a n d m a .
Twin T o w n combines an accurate impression of
life in a bleak Welsh t o w n with wicked black humour.
A whole spectrum of stereotypes is present, from the bent local copper
to the deluded teenager sleeping around to earn enough to escape her
life. Although the vices of every character may put s o m e viewers off,
others will find, the vicious humour and politically incorrect attitude to life
and drugs right up their street. Q

It's an often repeated fact that whether or not y o u like
| the film will d e p e n d o n h o w y o u feel about the TV
series. A s s u m i n g y o u are a fan of the endearing idiot
then, is this video worth t w o pounds of your money?
| The answer is a resounding yes. Although there may
not be many classic Bean moments, there is plenty of
character development here to compensate. There is
even something approaching a storyline which sees
Bean sent Stateside where he is mistaken for an eccentric yet brilliant art
critic. The inevitable havoc which follows provides plenty of laughs but
not as many as Bean's efforts to rectify the problems by going o n a Bond-
style mission. All in all, this is more than enough to provide an enjoyable
night in for Bean fans. D
