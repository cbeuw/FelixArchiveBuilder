Letters to Felix...
RECTORIAL
RESPONSE
Dear Editor,
I a m writing to comment on the
letter in last week's Felix about the
oil industry, and although there is a
great deal to be said 1 shall confine
myself to just three aspects.
First there are concerns that the
association of the College with the
oil industry may be unhealthy or in
some way damaging. Since its ear-
liest days the ethos of the College
has been to foster research and
teaching across a full spectrum
from the pure to the highly applied,
and to establish mutually beneficial
partnerships and strategic alliances
with industry, including the oil
industry. Indeed the Royal School
of M i n e s was established with the
prime purpose of supporting the
extractive industries and has for
many years worked closely with
t h e m . Like your correspondent,
many of us in the College are nos-
talgic for the days w h e n
Government support of research
w a s stronger, but that view
appears not to be shared by any
major political party. O n the other
hand, we d o not find ourselves sig-
nificantly constrained by our indus-
trial contracts. W e work on the
general principle of deciding what
we would like to do, and then find-
ing an industrial partner w h o has
the same objectives and is pre-
pared to meet the costs.
The College has recently led the
country, and possibly the world, in
creating a new academic depart-
ment, the T. H . Huxley School, that
brings together both the disciplines
necessary for the extraction of nat-
ural resources and those that focus
on understanding and managing
the environment. This change has
been w e l c o m e d by industry and is
simply an expression of the fact
that extractive practices that were
acceptable thirty years ago on a
planet with half its present popula-
tion and based on the understand-
ing available at that time, are not
viable today. The world will contin-
ue to need to extract its natural
resources, and I believe that the
College can play a leading role in
finding ways to d o this at accept-
able environmental cost. To have
any practical influence we need to
work in close collaboration with
industry.
Second, many undesirable con-
sequences were attributed to the
actions of major oil companies.
Whether we like it or not, much of
the twentieth century prosperity of
the western world and much of the
improvement in standard of living
that has c o m e about in the devel-
o p i n g w o r l d is attributable to
hydrocarbons, and in particular to
their use in the internal combustion
engine - a blessing that has in part
become a bane. However, blanket
demonization of individual c o m p a -
nies or industries because of par-
ticular perceived failures is not bal-
anced, sensible, or constructive.
That said, I d o not believe that
there is any large company in the
world, in the hydrocarbons field or
any other, that with hindsight does
not believe that it could and should
have done things better. Overall
one has to look at a m u c h wider
canvas than there is time or space
to d o here. But to take an example
at an almost trivial level, 1 believe
(but I d o not know for sure) that
over the years Shell has been
responsible for financing the higher
education of more students from
developing countries, indeed of
more students overall, than any
other private organisation in the
world. I also agree that inaccurate
and misleading statements have
been made by some oil-industry
lobbyists. Sadly the same is true of
their opponents who, all too often,
also seem to be unaware of the
practicalities of running a business.
Finally your correspondent sees
a conflict in interest between my
role as Rector and as a non-execu-
tive director of Shell. I see none. I
would go further. It seems to me
that the aims your correspondent
seeks to achieve may in fact be
helped by having people such as
me contributing to discussions of
company policy. After all 1 d o bring
a fairly g o o d knowledge of higher
education and research, have
worked in climate change, and
have devoted around twenty years
of my life to research into alterna-
tive energy sources etc. just a
thought!
•—-HI
GERMAN SOCKED
Dear Felix,
During my year out in Germany,
I felt deprived of not having estab-
lished e n o u g h contacts before
going out there, and felt I lacked
knowledge of German culture. I
was then determined to set up an
Anglo-German Society.
However, w h e n the forms were
handed in to the Union, the Union
people were confused - they did
not know where w e belonged! The
OSC thought w e should apply to
CSC [I think this should be SCC
(Social Clubs' Committee) - Ed]
since our society was not solely for
Germans. CSC on the other hand
did not want us because although
social and cultural integration was
our theme, our name strongly sug-
gested links with O S C . Three
months were w a s t e d while we
were oscillating between these two
committees, which clearly did not
have g o o d c o m m u n i c a t i o n
between each other. In the end, we
were 'kindly' accepted by O S C
under the condition that we had to
change our society's name to
German Soc.
During all these unnecessary
processes, w e have lost many
prospective m e m b e r s because
firstly, we missed the Freshers' Fair.
Secondly, the name German Soc
strongly suggests that this is a soci-
ety primarily for Germans (like
most overseas societies), so non-
Germans are put off.
Consequently, s o m e native
German speakers are driven away
because they have c o m e to Britain
to learn about British culture, rather
than have a regular 'let's-get-
homesick' gathering.
To be honest, we d o not care
about the politics going on behind
the scene; all w e wanted was to
provide a place for people w h o
share the same interests to meet
and gain mutual understanding of
each other and have some fun at
the same time. So, can somebody
tell me what's in a name? C o z I
apparently don't know the answer!
