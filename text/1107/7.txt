WE HOPE THAT
Y O U C H O K E
A few months ago, a study was
published suggesting that air pollu-
tion in the UK is killing more than
twenty thousand people annually.
N o w we have a report valuing the
damage at £ 1 1 billion [page two].
N o w I don't really expect our eco-
nomically-motivated government
to act on the health risk (apparent-
ly it's only our food and water that
qualify as health risks, not air), but
surely the gargantuan bill should be
enough to get even the most hard-
nosed capitalist on their feet? John
Prescott has learned to speak flu-
ent eco-jargon, but despite making
all the right noises, even the sim-
plest and cheapest policies have
still not been implemented.
The biggest problem with air
pollution is its invisibility; it can
rarely be seen, the body quickly
adjusts to the background stench
and it generates no serious public
interest. People have developed a
gung-ho attitude of total accep-
tance of the pollution. They stride
through smoggy streets with their
nose held high as if it was some
sort of challenge, rather like
Victorian alpinists w h o , frostbitten
and dying, still greeted others with
a hearty " G o o d Day" rather than
asking for help.
Everyone knows what happens
to the occupants if the exhaust
fumes are fed back inside a car, but
fail to realise the similarity between
this and the environment by a busy
street. The fact is that air pollution
damages the health of everyone in
cities, some times seriously, and
sometimes fatally. To paraphrase
Dylan, h o w many cars must a man
drive around before he dies of lung
cancer?
BEHIND THE
TIMES
1 recently bought a copy of the new
Imperial College Calendar. This is
essentially a college handbook
containing facts and figures about
all departments and services, and
although I a m still none the wiser
why it is called a calendar, it is
largely clear and accurate. 1 was,
however, rather surprised to find
the following paragraph in the
Admission section:
"Woman Students
Applications for w o m e n stu-
dents are encouraged. Several
halls of residence and student
houses have places for w o m e n
students."
