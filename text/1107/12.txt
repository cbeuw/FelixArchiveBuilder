THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:
Choo, choo...
I
went home this weekend, blazing a diagonal
trail up the country to m y murky Liverpudlian
abode. It m a y be an easy target for literary
attack, but the ordeal has forced m e to make
another negative c o m m e n t about o n e of our
great British traditions; the fantastic and historic
railway system.
Privatisation of the railways is here to stay;
with the government trying to make as m u c h
money as is absolutely possible, while craftily
shifting the responsibility for incompetence onto
the likes of Richard Branson. Nice guy though he
seems, a man w h o spends so m u c h time in bal-
loons is bound to be responsible for a lot of hot
air; an assertion which seems to be confirmed
by his promises to "raise the standard of the rail-
ways..."
M y sister told m e recently that o l ' Blighty
has the highest rail fares in the world. Having
paid onescore pounds a n d ten for a return tick-
et, I was immediately given the pleasure of star-
ing at an illuminated sign preaching a sermon
from above along the lines of "train not ready".
This situation prevailed for half an hour, while
my seat-obtaining punctuality advantage slowly
evaporated, like a c u p of cold, undrinkable rail-
way coffee. W h e n w e were finally given the priv-
ilege of seats, I w a s forced to sit in the smoking
section; it w a s either that or outside the mal-
functioning toilets. O n c e 1 had secured a seat
amongst empty ranks "Reserved" by seemingly

phantom commuters, God's M o b i u s - w a r p e d
sense of humour made an appearance by inflict-
ing a terrible plague upon me; hunger.
Lighting, it seems, is n o w reserved for the
first-class customers, presumably to counter
allegations of restrictive practices; I made it to
the buffet car, after passing through a carriage
where the lights had decided not to work. This
resulted in m u c h stumbling, buffeting from side
to side, occasional mutterings of " O h , I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there," a n d alleged cases of sex-
ual harassment.. I then had to return to my seat,
blinded by the bright lights of the buffet, clutch-
ing m y limp sandwiches a n d scalding coffee
while trying hard not to walk into any shell-suit-
ed Samson-size Scouse sportsmen. A n d which
sophist h a d the idea of affixing a full-length mir-
ror to the wall inside the toilet? Watching myself
perform a call of nature is not m y idea of luxury
travel.
Our one hope is that the money received
from ticket sales might be invested to improve
these meagre services. The ultimate irony, how-
ever, is that my ticket w a s not even stamped,
and will be subsequently used by one of my
friends to c o m e and visit m e . Hark! W a s that the
sound of someone shooting themselves in the
foot?
