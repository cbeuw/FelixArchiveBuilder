ICURFC I v St BARTS ICURFC II v
GREENWICH
A surge by the Imperial pack
resulted in a brace of tries before
the o p p o s i t i o n front r o w had
arrived at Harlington. A drive from
the forwards resulted in penetra-
tion, allowing Lionel to score for
the first time. Continued pressure
for the remainder of the half
caused a climax of tries.
After the half time mass
debate, several players slipped in
and out of the side causing confu-
sion amongst the IC defence. Two
quick tries left Barts within sniffing
distance of victory but IC were
soon back on the rampage with
Davo and Lionel splitting the
medics in two with a sleek pincer
movement resulting in a try.
Dan Colt's sharp eye spotted
an unmissable opportunity with a
press photographer on the sideline
to put one over with a charming
smile. All in all, a spanking perfor-
mance.
ICURFC I 31 - 15 St Barts
The day started shit. By the time
w e wanted to leave, w e didn't
have a full team or a kit. Then
Logic, our club captain got the per-
tol cap key stuck in the ignition of
our mini-bus W e were very late.
They immediately had us under
pressure, their pack was fat and
heavy. Still, with great speed, our
forwards set up an overlap for our
backs to take g o o d advantage of.
T o m Selter s c o r e d and Chris
Dickinson converted. Then they
brought on a ringer at p r o p .
Despite pressure on us w e m a n -
aged two more tries.
The second half looked to be
tough, but Kaisau had scared so
many of their players with his
vicious tackling that their backs
didn't even want the ball.
They m a n a g e d one score,
which would have been more had
it not been for excellent defence.
The final whistle blew and a great
victory for us was secured.
ICURFC II 17 - 7 Greenwich
ICURFC SEEKS SPONSORSHIP
This year has seen great changes to
Imperial's Rugby Clubs; R S M have
returned to the first team, a pro-
fessional coach has been signed to
train the team every week and n o w
the clubs' latest venture is to find
sponsorship.
With the arrival of professional
rugby, ICURFC is having to take
steps to remain competitive with
other clubs and unfortunately these
steps require extra funding for
training and equipment. The club is
also looking for extra funding to
support a three week tour to South
Africa this June. There exists only
limited subsidy from within college.
The first s t e p p e d is to
approach companies with an inter-
est in IC. By sponsoring one of the
largest clubs in college, firms have
a unique opportunity to raise their
profile and promote themselves
around the campus. Advertising is
not limited to IC though. The
Kensington & Chelsea Gazette and
Rugby World magazine have also
shown interest.

Firearm Fun
O n Saturday, the Rifle and Pistol
Club shot its first shoulder to shoul-
der match of the smallbore season.
It was the first time for half the
team, so it was with some trepida-
tion that w e awaited the arrival of
the Oxford team, one of the top
three teams in the country. They
came late, having stopped off to
shoot some paupers o n the way.
Eventually w e heard the distant
chant of "Rah rah rah, we're going to
smash the oiks!" that heralded their
arrival. Thus began the shooting.
Whilst the unfamiliar pressure
of match shooting meant that most
scores were lower than usual, w e
did well, losing narrowly by I 124
(out of 1200) to 1 139. Top score
for IC was from ' M a d ' M i k e
Eustace. To lose by such a small
margin to strong opposition in our
first match does us credit and suit-
ably e m b o l d e n e d w e are ready
approach our future matches with
relish.
ICUWHC v UMDS
W e are great! W e w o n and w e
played like donkeys, but w e are
lovely birds!
Bagpuss scored an intentional
goal that curved around the goal
keeper and in. Saboteur missed
4 5 2 . 5 potential goals but lived up
to her name and injured two IC
players with her golf shots. Our
wonderful captain, Snot Face, led
from the front with some stunning
play however was goat-like in the
' D ' . M i s s M i s s kept everything in
control at the back and yelled
'Dildo' all the time.
P.S. W e w o n 1 0 - 1 last week.
W e are special!!!
ICUWHC 1 1 - 0 UMDS.
ICUHC II v
PORTSMOUTH II
The game got off to a bright start
with plenty of IC pressure and w e
were unlucky at least once if not
twice. The game then m o v e d into a
fast flowing end to end game With
six minutes to go in the first half,
P o r t s m o u t h s c o r e d a break-

ICUFC II v CHESTER ICUFC IV v RHUL
Chester were the opponents for
the seconds in the second round
of the BUSA cup. W e knew the first
was going to be tough, and it was.
The second half continued in
the same vein but with IC losing a
little ground through inferior fit-
ness. But Rob had another storm-
ing game at the back and saved us
time and again. The first half of
extra time came and went with
both teams giving it their all. With
seven minutes to go Chester went
ahead. With 120 seconds left on
the clock, IC equalised with a
superb Pistol Pete header. With 60
seconds on the clock, however,
Chester went back in front and it
was all over. The best run for an IC
football team in the BUSA cup in
living memory was over, but even
so it was a magnificent perfor-
mance by the boys in black and
red. Hurrah!
ICUAFC 1 - 2 Chester
Having already lost to R H U L IV
twice this season, omens didn't
look g o o d , especially since
Holloway said that they consid-
ered us as a 'bye' into the next
round.
But our unmatched spirit, gen-
erated from years of camaraderie,
shone through to such an extent
that the Fourths managed to d o m -
inate the game from the kick-off.
Lacking key players served to
motivate our players further,
From the kick-off Chris took a
shot and despite dribbling out for a
throw-in it signalled our intent for
the rest of the game. 1 thought that
perhaps it wasn't to be our day,
but the all important goal was cre-
ated by Darren and calmly finished
by Chris. The expected a Holloway
onslaught never materialised and
Imperial Fourths never lost con-
centration. W e fully deserved our
victory.
ICUAFC IV 1 0 RHUL IV
