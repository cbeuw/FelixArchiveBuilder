ive piece indie bands are ten a
penny these days. It's always
the same old thing, one m o p -
headed, swaying bloke sings, a
sweaty one on the drums, t w o
playing guitars, and s o m e ligger
that plays the keyboard or tam-
bourine or just sort of dances
around, i.e. Bez and that's the
Philadelphia Bluntz * *
A
s the production of dance
music becomes more prolif-
ic, the emergence of what
can only be described as easy lis-
tening dance music grows. The
music itself is thus a contradiction
in terms, what should be making
you get up and dance, simply wafts
around you, having little, if any,
effect.
Philadelphia Bluntz are a clear
example of this. Their music is
drum and bass based, but even at
its most involving moments only
standard five piece. Dawn are dif-
ferent, they piss around with their
line up more often than President
Clinton shags his secretaries, and
that's a lot! O n e minute there's
only two of them on a track, pro-
ducing a minimal melody. Then the
next thing you know three people
are singing, sometimes with scary
Beach Boys like harmonies, three
on guitars, two on keyboards and
thank G o d only one on the drums.
Figure that one out with only five
members!! Not only do they do
that but they also employ the most
innovative instruments this side of
the m o o n . Interesting noises are
produced by Phasers, Speedway,
Hollow-bone Nose Drone, M C 3 0 3 ,
H a - H a , Numerics, Cigarettes, and
finally a Drone-Stick Squealer.
H m m very interesting indeed.
D o w n to the music, Dawn pro-
duce a pleasant, if not slightly dark
sounding noise. They are not too
heavily guitar orientated and can
often sound like one of the better
inspires the tapping of a foot. I
suppose what we have is almost
ambient, but the feeling is general-
ly less sleepy. The m o o d unsurpris-
ingly is quite neutral, but does
s h o w at times potential to go
where y o u ' d never expect.
Stand out tracks are the funky
Blue, and Hullabaloo which is prob-
ably the most involving track on
the album, if only for its slightly
grating vocal section. The album
then finishes with Intro, which sug-
gests the album should be on
bands of the early eighties. Tracks
like Windy Miller are sung in a mild-
ly depressing monotone that adds
atmosphere and meaning to the
words. However at times their use
of crazy instruments detracts from
their essentially best material. The
more simplistic melodies are sup-
ported very capably by their miriad
of vocalists with lyrics being mean-
ingful and full of emotion. O n more
than one occasion I found myself
comparing the band and much of
the music they produce to the
material produced by Frank Black,
formally of the Pixies. O n tracks like
Sgt Crowley, Dawn sound more like
a mixture of The Cult and Soft Cell.
M y personal favourite is Radars,
which is a more modern sounding,
up beat track very reminiscent of
the better, new, British bands
around at the moment. Next big
thing, who knows, this could be
just the Dawn for the Replicants. El
Ramzi
repeat, the standard setting for all
my background listening.
Overall a mediocre album that
inspires little, but will help aid sleep
for spring term insomniacs. CI

KRISTIN HERSH
Strange Angels * * *
T
hrowing M u s e Kristin Hersh
makes beautiful music.
Sparse, precise acoustic
arrangements of articulate sopra-
no, expertly picked guitar, arpeg-
gioed harpsichord and only the
occasional tambourine providing
percussion; the emphasis is direct-
e d solely to each s o n g itself.
Hersh's lively chord structures and
lullaby melodies at first misdirect
and then bring into sharp relief
some chilling libretto, much in the
fashion of a more subdued and
less world weary Kurt Cobain.
The first t w o tracks do little to
inspire but then are followed by
seven consecutive recordings of
undeniable brilliance and under-
stated power. Touching on subject
matters many artists shy from,
Strange Angels is an uneasy listen.
Clever w o r d p l a y and pleading
emotion combine well in the first
half but the second leans toward
self indulgence; the simplicity of
the arrangement. If this record had
the five weaker tracks removed,
and with a more open-minded and
less indulgent producer than
Hersh, I would have been so much
more gushing in my praise. With
luck the f o r t h c o m i n g Throwing
M u s e s album will be better. If, if, if.
What might have been, what might
have been... El Mr.Trout
