Teacher Training' News in Brief...
for Lecturers
ANDREW OFORI
There is a glimmer of hope on the
horizon for those w h o leave lec-
tures more confused and worried
than when they entered. Plans to
put n e w lecturers t h r o u g h a
s c h e m e of what is effectively
teacher training are at a develop-
mental stage within the college,
and students are being encouraged
to give input in order to enhance
the standards of education.
The requirement for a stan-
dardised s y s t e m of training
lecturers has been identified world-
wide, with many countries current-
ly designing national programmes.
The UK campaign has c o m e about
as a result of Sir Ronald Dearing's
inquiry into higher education. A
body known as the 'Accreditation
on Teaching In Higher Education'
consisting of 'key stakeholders'
such as the N U S a n d the
Chancellor's Committee, has been
formed to put a workable system in
place.
There already exists a course of
workshops and training sessions
run by Prof Sinclair G o o d l a d for
probationary lecturers at IC, but at
present not all departments con-
sider it mandatory. P r e c e d i n g
Government proposals, the college
is now planning to construct a
scheme that all new lecturers will
be required to take part in, and stu-
dents are being asked to put their
views across.
The scheme will be a system of
accreditation, including an assess-
ment and a longer course than is
presently the case. The College's
two education development lectur-
ers, Dr Caroline Baillie and Dr Rita
Van de Vorst, will be instrumental
in the implementation of the pro-
gramme. Dr Baillie emphasised
that "Lecturers have got to think
about why they're teaching the way
they're teaching and how effective
they will be in getting students to
learn". She spoke of the 'world-
wide realisation' that new lecturers
needed to be given instruction and
time to c o n t e m p l a t e their
approach to education. Dr Baillie
feels it vital that students take
responsibility for their o w n learning
and channel their creativity into the
building of a system that benefits
all concerned.
The college's Pro-Rector for
Educational Quality, Prof Tim Clark,
described the importance of posi-
tively identifying objectives for the
training in preparation for any
Government proposals. H e sees
extensive consultation as one of
the essential elements of early talks
and surmised "The object of the
exercise is to safeguard teachers,
and most importantly safeguard
students"
Students are able to get
involved through the Student LINK
group (London Imperial NetworK)
for education development w h o
will begin plans with the staff LINK
group at a meeting on 9 M a r c h . It
is hoped that the issue will strike a
chord with students and they will
take full advantage of this opportu-
nity: The student LINK group
requires a student representative
from each department. Interested
students should contact Kinishka
Sinha o n k.sinha@ic.ac.uk. For

C&GU 'BOTTOMING OUT'
continued from front page
constitution, he c o m m e n t e d ,
"We need to completely re-struc-
ture the U n i o n . This year has
shown that the present system just
doesn't w o r k . " In a d d i t i o n , M r
Tylee-Birdsall highlighted the need
for a thorough a s s e s s m e n t of
C & G U ' s current financial position,
"We need to know what we're
doing and where we're g o i n g " .
Finally, he pointed to c o m m u n i c a -
tion between officers as one of
Guilds' biggest failures this year,
"Exec try to stick to their o w n jobs
and d o n ' t w o r k together as a
team... I don't even know w h o half
the Dep Reps are, and I didn't see
them at O & M C yesterday... w e
haven't a clue what's going on half
the time".
Hamish C o m m o n , Guildsheet
Editor, sees M r Tylee-Birdsall as
the ideal candidate; "He's some-
one w h o ' s not interested in politics
and image... w h o doesn't sound-
off or shout '1 want X, Y, Z' ", and
Soren D y m o n d , Guilds Treasurer,
w a r m l y e n d o r s e d h i m , a d d i n g
"He's a great poker partner".
SUSPECTS CAUGHT
Two men believed to be involved in
several thefts on the Imperial
College campus were apprehended
by Imperial College security last
Thursday, and have subsequently
been arrested by police officers.
The men have been caught before,
but there was insufficient evidence
to detain them. Ken Weir, Deputy
Security Manager, explained that on
previous occasions the men had
given reasons for being on college
premises. However when caught in
Beit Quad they could not claim it
was a 'shortcut', and were detained
pending police investigation.
MASSIVE MERGER
The news of a merger between
Glaxo-Wellcome and SmithKline
B e e c h a m , t w o of the w o r l d ' s
largest biotechnology companies,
has provoked fears that jobs will
be lost and funding for research at
institutions such as Imperial
College will suffer. Roger Lyons,
the Manufacturing, Science and
Finance Union's general secretary,
speaking in The Times Higher
Education S u p p l e m e n t , c o m -
mented "This merger could have
devastating implications for uni-
versity research and science grad-
uate employment." However Dr
Chris Evans, formerly a microbiol-
ogist at Imperial, and now a mil-
lionaire biotechnology entrepre-
neur, c o m m e n t e d in the same
article that he thought the merger
was "extremely exciting" and that
the new company would be even
more supportive of science in
Britain.
CANNABIS STUDY
The House of Lords has launched
a high powered investigation into
the legal status of the drug
cannabis. Following the British
Medical Association's November
report on the possible benefits of
the medical prescription of
cannabinoids. Lord Chief Justice,
Lord Bingham, is calling for a
"detached, objective, i n d e p e n -
dent" consideration of the issue
and the formation of a Lords
Select C o m m i t t e e . Chaired by
Liberal Democrat Peer Lord Perry
of Walton, a former professor of
pharmacology, the all party c o m -
mittee's terms of reference is said
to cover "the scientific case for
and against relaxing the prohibi-
tion o n the medical and recre-
ational use of cannabis". After tak-
ing evidence from 'expert wit-
nesses', the Select Committee will
hold public hearings after Easter,
with a report scheduled for c o m -
pletion in October.
SPEAKER DEALERS
Belgravia Police have released
details of a second street trader
they are attempting to appre-
h e n d . The van, registration
P415JP0, has been spotted near
to both the South Kensington and
St M a r y ' s c a m p u s e s , and has
been used to sell audio equip-
ment to passers-by. The activities
of these vendors, w h o have been
present in the area for several
years, is apparently b e c o m i n g
more furtive, leading to an
Imperial student being kidnapped
last week and forced to withdraw
money from a cash point.
Anyone seeing the van should
report it to Sherfield Security on
x 5 8 9 0 0 , noting the time, location,
description of the vehicle's occu-
pants and details of any conversa-
tion held. O n no account should
anyone enter into any purchase or
get into the van.
AIR DEADLY
The true cost of UK air pollution is
c o m i n g to light following a recent
report that values the damage at
Â£ 1 1 billion annually. The study,
published of I C S M ' s National
Heart and Lung Institute,
attempts to place a monetary
value of the "loss of quality of life"
caused by the airborne toxins. The
model e m p l o y e d , similar to that
used by the Government when
c o n d u c t i n g feasability studies,
involves quizzing the public on
how m u c h they would be willing
to pay to avoid the problems
associated with air pollution. Poor
air quality is currently thought to
be responsible for health prob-
lems in millions of UK citizens,
and the report claimed "It makes
economic and health sense to
clean up the air in our cities as an
urgent priority."
