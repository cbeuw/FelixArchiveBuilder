CONSIDERED
OPINION
Dear Jeremy,
Having a foot in both camps, it
was interesting to see that Felix has
finally c o m e out resolutely against
the C C U s . It appears that they are
self-serving, irrelevant and misun-
derstand their role.
Although I cannot agree that
the C C U s should be abolished, the
accusations have s o m e weight.
There is still confusion as to exact-
ly what the C C U s should be achiev-
ing, although there are signs of
change, with 2 sabbaticals in the
I C S M a n d wholesale structural
change in the RCS. CfkGCU's inac-
tivity over the past year is not a rea-
son for the abolition of the entire
structure. C C U s have d e c l i n e d
slowly over the past 70 years or so,
due to much larger social changes
in what people identify with.
Students apply through U C A S to
'Imperial College' and only hear of
the C C U s w h e n they get here.
Many d o not know which C C U their
department belong to. At the top
end, the introduction of Pro-
Rectors even removed some of the
duties of the Deans.
C C U s now find that their role
covers academic affairs, s o m e wel-
fare, social meetings, alumni asso-
ciation recruitment and career help.
Some of these are covered by
departmental societies - which are
part of the C C U structure. Felix
thinks that these jobs would be bet-
ter done if 'properly run', (i.e. by
1CU). It is also of the opinion that
students can't be trusted to run our
unions for ourselves. W h o else is
going to run them? The position of
Dep Rep, for example, is by its
nature departmental. The existence
of the C C U acts as an extra
devolved layer of academic sup-
port, with certain jobs within its
remit. The ICU sabbs d o not need
to worry about Jim's unfair lab
mark, but a Dep Rep/AAO could
sort it out before some ICU drone
storms in, guns blazing. These peo-
ple sit on plenty of high-level c o m -
mittees so that they can bring these
problems to attention. I cannot see
that ICU will be able to d o that any
better, and the idea that C C U aca-
demic representatives are not
approachable or efficient is an
insult to those that work hard in an
unpopular job.
It is said they shouldn't be
called 'Unions' - again they are not
- they are called 'Constituent
College Unions', part of ICU. There
is no doubt that the main student's
union is ICU, and it does its job
very well. If this serves to create
confusion, then it is the job of pub-
lications like this to dispel that. The
names and crests, older than
Imperial itself, are not going any-
where. The alumni associations and
many others wouldn't stand for it.
If the C C U s are shells of their for-
mer selves, than so be it. But let
them d o the job that they are sup-
posed to do, and can d o properly.
Yours ever,

UNCONSIDERED
OPINION
bah, h u m b u g a n d all that
malarkey. what a thoroughly crap
editorial you seem to have written
this week.
I mean, just cos C&.G are going
through a rough patch (something
which has admittedly been going
on for the best part of a year and a
half, since they got some strippers
in for their freshers welcome) is no
reason to call for the abolition of all
the CCU's and then well., lets just
say that your arguements range
from the pathetic to the badly
researched.
The current roles of the C C U
involves providing a network of
social and academic support for
their students, this doesn't involve
attempting to run any bars (with
the possible exception of the RCSU
beer festival). Your escription of
the situation with a bad lecturer is
about right to be honest (though
you left out the year representa-
tives) but then surely anyone w h o
has done any reasonable amount of
work with the union (especially
those doing a sabbatical) must
realise that trying to get college to
admit they are wrong is nearly
impossible, and getting a lecturer
to change their ways is nigh on
impossible, a year is a damn g o o d
result for most of the problems dis-
cussed. Fortuneatly a lot of dep
reps don't have this extremely nar-
row minded attitude, and are pre-
pared to put in work for things
which won't directly benefit them
but make life better for those w h o
will follow in later years.
as a final comment the situation
with anyh of the CCU's can be read-
ily compared with that of felix. The
quality of this years news coverage
has., to be honest been crap, but is
this the esteemed editors fault...
well no, it;'s more the fault of the
students w o h don't get off their
arses and write articles for felix
(though an editor whose election
update was obviously done long
before the second candidate for DP
F&S signed up yesterday morning
does imply a certain laziness in the
quest for ground breaking news).
anyway thats about that.
Stuart Jenkins
Ordinarily, I try to refrain from
ranting on in the letters pages.
After all, they're supposed to be
for your opinions, not mine.
However, I cannot permit such
illiterate, ignorant twaddle as Mr
Jenkins has seen fit to make pub-
lic to go unquestioned in Felix.
Firstly, describing the C & C
Union's current state of total
ineptitude as a 'bad patch' is
rather like calling World War Two
'unfortunate1
. In researching the
story ('C&G Union 'A Joke", Felix
1106), one of my reporters
attempted to contact the C&G
Union fourteen times over three
days, both by telephone and in
person, and at no point was the
C & G U office manned or even
unlocked. Quite how they are
supposed to "provide a network
of social and academic support"
solely by telepathy was not
explained in your letter. As for
accusing me of bad research, 1
wonder how much in-depth fact-
finding you required before con-
cluding that CCUs don't run any
bars when, as most students are
well aware, ICSMSU currently
runs two. The fact that control of
these bars will soon be handed
over to ICU serves to highlight
the CCUs' increasing obsoles-
cence.
It is ironic that immediately
after damning my arguments as
"pathetic" you then feel that my
comments on bad lecturers -
which formed the bulk of my arti-
cle - were "about right". Adopting
the fatalist attitude that dogs so
many at IC, you write that initiat-
ing change in the college system
is "impossible". If so, then why do
you advocate continued invest-
ment of time and money into try-
ing to do just that?
Fortunately, my own opinions
are a little less cynical. I do not
believe that changing the system
and forcing lecturers to embrace
the wishes of their students is
impossible - though it is difficult.
This is why I argued to abandon
the sinking ship of C C U social
provision and concentrate on the
far more important aim of effec-
tive academic representation for
students.
