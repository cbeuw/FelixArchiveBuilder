10 COLUMNS 13 February 1998
There's nothing the press
like to do more than
write about themselves.
Opportunity to do so was recent-
ly given, when the press was
bringing attention to the tactics
Rupert Murdoch, owner of News
International, was using to main-
tain his control in the newspaper
industry.
Murdoch had been engaging in
various price cuts in the Times,
subsidising them from his Sky
network profits and running the
Times at a loss, his opponents
say. The Times countered that,
saying in its editorial that the
Times/Sunday Times ran at a very
good profit (although it didn't the
Times itself did - could the
Sunday Times be subsidising the
Times?) and that what it was
doing was morally acceptable.
Murdoch has many enemies - one
does not get to become a world-
wide press baron without making
some - and he is known as a
bully, in the economic sense.
What brought this issue to atten-
tion was the Competition Bill
presently going through the
House, to keep us in line with EU
Law. These are the occasions that
demonstrate the usefulness of
the Lords - since the Upper
House are unpaid and cannot be
fired, they only turn up if they feel
like it, and it seems that on this
occasion, they felt like it. An
amendment to the bill in the
Lords, proposed by the Lib Dems,
was specifically aimed at
Murdoch, or more specifically,
the Times, whose circulation has
increased to 800 000, partly at
the expense of the Telegraph and
Independent, and partly by
increasing the number of people
reading broadsheets. The amend-
ment passed by 121 votes to 93,
and creates a headache for Tony
Murdoch for all it's worth. The
Independent is present in dire
financial straits, and the price-
cutting at the Times will serve to
further deepen its crisis. As they
said, there is no point on having a
loss-making title unless you
intend to rid the market of a com-
petitor. They are worried that this
will reduce press diversity, which
can only be a bad thing. Murdoch
already single-handedly ditched
the newspaper 'Today', for what-

Blair. He will have no problem in
overturning it in the Commons,
but it will look like he is riding
roughshod over the will of the
House (which he is). Labour and
the Tories both oppose the plan,
more out of fear than anything
else, but there are plenty of MPs
on both sides that would like to
vote for the amendment.
Polly Toynbee, a known opponent
of Murdoch, has recently been
writing in the Guardian, calling on
the great and the good to oppose
ever reason. This removed a cen-
tre-left paper, leaving only one,
the Independent left. Now the
Independent is under threat.
Murdoch is known to have his
papers espouse those views that
are in his own best self-interest.
His opposition to the Euro is
reflected in his papers' editorial
line. The Sun has now got a repu-
tation of winning parties election.
It is said you can't win one with-
out them - a myth Murdoch is
quite happy to keep going. The
worry here is that there is a pow-
erful media baron, who isn't even
British, and may not have British
interests as his first priority. The
Labour Government will remem-
ber well in the Eighties when
Labour's planned policy of ban-
ning foreign ownership of the
media was naturally ruthlessly
opposed by Murdoch, with savage
effect in the polls. He was send-
ing a warning to anyone who dare
oppose him again.
Recently, Ministers hinted at a
deal that would get them off the
hook in the Commons and pre-
vent an embarrassing rebellion -
since the single mothers vote,
backbenchers know that they
have the muscle to cause prob-
lems for the Government if they
so desired. The Government may
introduce an amendment that
will deal 'more precisely' with the
problem of newspaper wars. This
will act as a compromise to dif-
fuse the situation without losing
face. But soon, Blair may have to
make a decision. Should he keep
his famed friendship with
Murdoch going, or should he leg-
islate in the interest of the British
press and people? The two are
sadly not the same.

As a special bonus this week, here
are t w o recipes from the cook so
wise, he almost makes preparing
dinner parties enjoyable...
1. Tarte a la Tomate
®" Vi lb ripe tomatoes
®' 4 - 5 tbl dijon mustard
®' Short crust pastry made
with 8 o z flour etc as
explained in a previous
Burning Water
Preheat your oven to 210°C, gas
mark 7. Meanwhile roll out the
pastry to about 2 - 3 m m thick and
place it in you well greased tart tin.
Spread the mustard out evenly
around the pastry (like tomato o n
a pizza). Slice the tomatoes thinly
and lay them out around the tart
so that they overlap by about '/» a
slice each. Sprinkle with salt, pep-
per and whatever herbs y o u have
around .
Put in the oven till the pastry is
nice and brown, about 20 minutes.
2. Chicken Cacciatore
®" 1 chicken, dead
r J P
1 onion
»• 5 cloves of garlic
1 tin tomatoes
®" 1 glass of wine
Loadsa olive oil
Hack the chicken to pieces. Y o u
should end up with 2 legs, 2 wing
bits, 2 breasts and a carcass. Heat
up about 1cm of oil in a frying pan
until it's smokin1
hot. Fry all the
chicken pieces until well brown.
You'll probably find it easier to d o a
couple of pieces at a time and I'm
told it's better to fry the skin side
first - it helps to retain the juices.
C h o p and fry the onion and
gatlic until they're also thoroughly
brown, adding s o m e pepper and a
tbl of paprika near the e n d .
Deglaze the frying pan with the
glass of wine (we've been over this
before) and combine everything in
a large pot. Heat up and leave to
simmer gently for at least an hour.
A great carbohydrate a c c o m -
paniment to this is polenta - a
golden yellow paste made from
ground up corn. It's available from
most market street stores and the
instructions on the packet are usu-
ally reasonable so follow them.
