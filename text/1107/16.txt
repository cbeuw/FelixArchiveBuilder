16 MANIFESTOS 13 February 1998
Ed Sexton Felix Editor
The success of Felix depends not Just
on the editor, but on the students
who volunteer their time to make it
the professional publication it is. M y
first priority as Felix Editor will be to
encourage more students to become
involved through increased publicity,
especially at the start of the Autumn
term. As Imperial's campuses contin-
ue to merge, I feel it is increasingly
important that students from all parts
of the college contribute to the news-
paper. To this end Felix will have a
representative at each of the main
campuses, who would be in regular
contact for news and information.
Felix is a newspaper, not a magazine,
and its primary concern should be
issues relevant to students. However,
Felix should also entertain the reader-
ship: The diverse features and review
sections will stay, but I feel the layout
needs clarification to make them
more accessible.
I want to improve the quality of
writing throughout Felix, specifically
the reviews and sports pages; articles
can be well written whilst retaining
their wit and entertainment value.
Felix is and will remain independent,
and I will protect its editorial freedom
from external influences. It will not
take any particular political stance,
but will reflect the opinions of all stu-
dents at the college.
For Felix to maintain and improve
upon its current high standards, it is
vital that it has someone committed
and organised in the position of edi-
tor. Last year I successfully co-edited
Phoenix, Imperial's arts magazine, as
well as running my own society with
its own column in Felix. As News
Editor, 1 am very familiar with how
Felix is run, both technically and
administratively. I am committed and
organised, and with your support I
can ensure that Felix remains an infor-
mative, entertaining and excellent
publication.

Fresh
Felix is always in need of a constant
stream of fresh ideas. This means
that it is important for people at col-
lege to get involved if their ideas and
views are to be expressed. I intend to
make Felix much more accessible to
everyone who wants to contribute. I
want to also include a regular new
section where clubs and societies can
tell us either about their events or just
what they do.
Imaginative
Any publication lives or dies by the
quality of its articles. I intend to make
sure that next year the features and
columns in Felix are not only innova-
tive and interesting but also relevant
to students here at Imperial College.
Diverse
The most important part of Felix is its
content, it is important to have cur-
rent and accurate news to inform
readers of events not only at College
but also all the issues relating to stu-
dents in London. To create a truly
diverse Felix, however, it is important
to have a reviews section that is
entertaining and informative as well
as a sports section that is inclusive
and up to date.
Restyled
For a long time, Felix has been an
unhappy compromise between a
magazine and a newspaper. I intend
to make next year's issue into a mag-
azine. This opens up a whole new
range of possibilities for the design
and layout and, I guarantee, will result
in the best looking Felix ever!
1 care enough about the future of Felix
not to just let it become a 'rag' that
people pick up on a Friday morning -
I want to give it a breath of fresh air.
If you want a Felix you can be proud
of next year, make sure you vote for
me.
