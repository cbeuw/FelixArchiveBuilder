MANIFESTOS 13 February 1998
"Elections? Again? Already?"
I'm afraid so. Once again, it's
time to get out and vote on who you
want to be in charge of Imperial
College Union. Eight candidates have
stood for the four positions, and to
help you decide which to vote for,
each have written their manifestos
(below). You can also see them per-
form live at the hustings (6pm
Monday 16 Feb in dBs, 6pm Tuesday
17 Feb in the Reynolds Building,
Charing Cross campus and 6pm
Wednesday 18 Feb in Glady's bar, St
Mary's campus).
Voting takes place 1 Oam - 5pm
Monday 23 and Tuesday 14 Feb in all
departments. VOTE!
Dave Hellard President
Dave Hellard: the M a n , the Myth, the
Legend
The question every voter should
ask as they step towards the ballot
box is who is David Hellard and why I
should vote for him? I know I have. I
am not the traditional Union 'stiff
and I think that worries some people,
the fact that I'm not just a Union offi-
cial who finds himself with no-where
higher to go, no more power to get
other than to run for President.
So why am 1 different? Simply, I
work in the Union, I live in the Union
and I live for the Union. I have spent
my time in and around the Union and
unlike many previous contenders,
merely CV seeking point pimps, 1 see
problems, I see issues and it's time
someone stood for the right reasons,
to make a change.
Next year students will be com-
ing to University with less money than
ever before. The Union in turn will be
relied upon even more heavily. The
money it provides through jobs and
funding, combined with the easy
access to cheap living could be the
difference between the students
being able to afford to come to
Imperial or not. The added pressure
of money on students will also see a
need for our counselling services to
be even wider reaching.
This is why I must be president,
to maintain the high standards
already set by the Union and to
assure that the changes that need to
be made will be made.
I work in the Union, I live in the
Union and I live for the Union. It's
time for the students to make their
mark.
Jon Lambert President
For nearly four years 1 have enjoyed
being a part of ICU at various levels -
through being involved with clubs,
using the bars and catering, as an
employee and more recently sitting
on ICU Council - last year as Chair of
the Community Action Group and
currently as Council Chair. I now have
the opportunity to do more for ICU
and all of its members.
Facilities
October will see a significant increase
in the number of Students on the
South Kensington campus. This will
bring increased demands on facilities:
• Beit Quad redevelopment - These
plans need to be implemented as
quickly as possible in order to provide
sufficient facilities for the increasing
number of students who wish to use
them.
• The current trend within college to
reduce the amount of social space
provided in departments must be
halted and, where possible, reversed.
• Throughout this change, it should
never be forgotten that Imperial is
now a multi-campus university. I will
fight to ensure that facilities at the
outlying campuses do not suffer.
Representation
• Dep. Reps. - the current system
does not always work and needs to
be re-examined.
• Awareness - effective communica-
tion is required if ICU is to truly rep-
resent its members.
Accommodation
• It is important to ensure that the
debacle at the beginning of the year
does not recur. Students have the
right to expect a certain level of ser-
vice from the Accommodation Office.
• A vetting system for Landlords
should be encouraged.
I am not going to promise things that
I know I cannot achieve, but I can
promise that if you elect me for ICU
President, you will be electing some-
one who has the experience, enthusi-
asm and determination to lead your
Union effectively through this period
of change.
Simon Cooper Deputy President (Clubs and Societies)
As an MSc student, I've had much
time in this college to appreciate the
variety of clubs and societies within
the college, and I think I've got a lot
out of them. So essentially the major
reason behind my candidacy is to
allow me the chance to see them
improve even further.
Next year, as ever, we shall be
faced with further integration: the
opening of the BMS building to new
students will bring a whole load more
students onto the campus, where
they will be much better placed to
take advantage of the facilities here.
These facilities will need to be
improved to cope, but not at the
expense of those currently off the
campus. Biology's move from the
quad will also have major implications
for the union - plenty of expansion
potential, meaning new rooms,
potentially for clubs needing them,
and more space for college nightlife.
I come from a varied background
within the college, encompassing
some CCU involvement in the distant
past, occasional rugby playing, the
odd cultural society and a hefty
involvement running various recre-
ational clubs, primarily the canoe club.
With this experience I feel I have a
useful working knowledge with which
to begin, and 1 learn quickly too.
I intend to put my commitment
and effort into improving all our clubs,
not just those based on the campus,
and ensuring the facilities, such as the
sports grounds, the resource centre
and store spaces are continually
maintained at an adequate level.
That's all folks, vote for me.
