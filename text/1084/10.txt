Luscious Jackson offer
you an album of tunes slinkier than
an eel in a catsuit, with Ronettes
harmonies to die for and a heavy
seasoning of hip hop. This New
York all girl quartet are signed to
the Beastie Boy's Grand Royal label,
possibly one of the hippest places
in the world. It is, without doubt, fly
and kicking as well. The Beastie's
influence is not as apparent as one
might think, although the naked
attitude and cool beats are there. A
closer reference point is Beck, mixing up styles into a gar-
gantuan gumbo of grooves. Naked Eye with lyrics like
'Wearing nothing is divine/Naked is a state of mind' is
pure sex on a stick with enough breathy vocals to make
Madonna look like a repressed convent girl. If a song can
turn this most uncoordinated of music hacks into a vogue-
ing loon, it must truly have a groove deeper than the
Grand Canyon. And yet on Mood Swing, we have a more
pensive, laid back jazz that transports you instantly to a
roof-top bar, Southern Comfort in hand and city night life
cruising below. The sultry shimmy
of Under Your Skin is like TLC jam-
min' with The Breeders, and 'If
you wanna know all of my origi-
nal sins/Ask the Virgin, she
knows where I been' is a
sweaty-palmed delight.
Even if they do tarry a little too
long with Sheryl Crow styled AOR
on tracks like Soothe Yourself and
Why do I lie?, this is easily forgiv-
able by the sheer lushness of the
sound and coupled with person-
al, well-observed lyrics, they are indeed Luscious, and
they're begging you to come on over, kick your shoes off
and dance a little. Come on, move your body and dance
with me.. (7)
