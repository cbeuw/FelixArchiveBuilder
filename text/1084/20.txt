Hockey babes triumph
in final
With afternoon sun showering the
pitch in gentle spring warmth, the IC
ladies beat Charing Cross in the U L
plate final. We started the game well
with Two Hands and Lt Warf com-
bining well to inspire fear in the
ranks of Charing's defence.
They mounted several blitzkrieg
attacks down the wings. The IC line
held firm due to good keeping from
Kiss Miss [Miss Kiss, Kiss Kiss?]
and solid defensive play from
Humming Bird.
The game now flowed freely, with
the IC team proving that they're a
well oiled machine. Nude Girl found
herself in front of goal thanks to the
efforts of Two Hands and Barbie.
Nude Girl finally passed through this
ordeal to stroke the ball into the net.
They came back hard and were
soon driving into the IC " D " from all
over the place. The defence of Sarah
C, Groin Sprain and Fash the Bash
held out and repulsed numerous
attacks until half-time.
The second half started with IC
just holding out but it was only a
matter of time before they finally
broke through and put the ball in the
net. This was a blow, but ICWHC
are not a soft touch, especially in big
matches like these.
Inspired by a fighting spirit,
Humming Bird became Fuming Bird
as she ran round the pitch doing
absolutely everything. Their goal
was under siege - the goal had to
come and it duly did. At this stage
they were exhausted and we domi-
nated to run out winners.
ICWHC 2 - 1 Charing Cross
Hockey thirds more
coherent than usual
Things looked dodgy with Pongo
being declared to poor to play for the
team. This meant a reshuffle was
needed with Turnip Man being
pushed up to fill the vacant position.
The game started well with an
early goal scoring opportunity com-
ing after a lovely one-two between
Spasmo and Cantfuce left
Beekeeping For Fun And Profit"
with an easy shot at goal. Sadly this
hit the post and U C L took the oppor-
tunity to launch their own offensive.
Play switched to our goalmouth
through some slack defending from
Thora Hird's Luminous Revolving
Panty Liners. The score was kept 0-0
thanks to the efforts of goalkeeper A
Million Flannels Covered In
Marmite And Thrown At A Squirrel.
The half ended disastrously with
injury forcing Uncooked Meat Prior
To State Vector Collapse to retire,
replaced by Mmmmadagascar.
In the second half we lost our star
striker Mystic Meg's All-Seeing
Crystal Balls and they started to pres-
sure our defence. Despite the efforts
of captain Swirling Mist Of
Melodious Vapours, Ever Waxing
And Waning Like An Infinite Sea Of
Velvet Covered Truffles, their
advantage was soon turned into
goals. Our only consolation was a
last minute goal from Ba Bar Bar Bar
Ga Dang Ga Dang Dang Ramma
Lamma Ding Dong Blue Moon.
ICHC III 1-4 U C L

Chess team in girlfriend
shock
Last Thursday IC 2nd Chess Team,
in Division 3 of the Middlesex
League, were away at Muswell Hill.
Having crushed their opponents
6.5-1.5 at the home match in
December, they expected an easy
win. On board one, Jeremy Davies
whipped up a promising attack with
black against a much stronger player
but then blew it by blundering away
a knight. Gigi Desogus thwarted an
attack on his castled king; while
launching his own offensive on the
other wing, he overlooked a fork
from his opponent's knight, losing a
rook and the game. Andy Slough and
Patrick Duncan had easy wins
despite rustiness due to several
months absence from the team.
Captain Barry Gale, desperately
short of time and seeing no hope in a
b e d
tense situation, did the only sensible
thing - wildly counter-attacked! His
confused opponent is contemplating
resignation. At the cost of a pawn
Rob Kruszynski brought his pieces
swiftly into action with daring
attacks on his opponent's marauding
queen. After three hours of complex
manouvering they were still playing.
Paitrick's girlfriend Sonja coura-
geously stepped in as a reserve (our
first ever female player) with only
one hour of lessons! She put up a
brave fight but was quickly defeated
by an experienced opponent. Lloyd
Kilford offered an early draw (his
usual tactic against much stronger
opposit ion) which was refused. He
lasted a creditable 50+ moves.
The score is 4 - 2 to Muswell Hill
with two games unfinished.

This is from the game P Hurn v B Gale. White played Qxc7 and went
on to win. Can you spot a more decisive move he could have made?
IC Rugby lose to St Hils
Er yeah, fuckin' great match. At least
I think it was, somebody jumped on
my head during the first scrum and I
can't remember much after that.
Erm, Oh! There was this bit where
they scored a try right and while the
ref was watching this, psycho kicked
their fly-half in the kidneys. Nice one
psycho! Or was it Killer? Anyway it
was fuckin' good. Later I managed to
eat someone's ear.
Then at half time we had our usual
thirteen pints so things got a bit con-
fused after that. Hey! Now I remem-
ber, it was fuckin' hilarious!
Everyone's covered in mud right, so
no-one can tell who the fuck anyone
is. So anyway Skull-crusher thinks
he's found one of their props so he
elbows them in the face and breaks
their jaw. Turns out later it wasn't
one of their's, it was Vandal. Fuckin'
great, he's going to need surgery.
Fuckin' great.
