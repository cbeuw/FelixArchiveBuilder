16 COLUMNS F E L I X FRIDAY 2 5 T H APRIL
Before we get down to business, I
must deal with young Benjamin
Weir and his rather amusing letter
last term, in which he accused me of
being a fascist and Felix of being
politically biased. Though his year
and department were omitted from
his contribution, it is abundantly
clear that he is a 12 year old prodigy
in the Maths Department- can differ-
entiate with the best of them, but is
cursed with a Ruth Lawrence-esque
naivete about the real world. For the
sake of young Mr Weir, 1 shall make
two points. Firstly, the political com-
plexion of a newspaper is set by its
editorial, not its opinion writers; for
example Harry Enfield, self-con-
fessed 'Bollinger Bolshevik' now
writes for the Sunday Telegraph.
Secondly, there is no surer way to
undermine an argument than the
careless use of emotive words such
as fascist. Better luck next time, son.
On May 1st, this country is faced
with one of the most important deci-
sions of our lifetime. We, by com-
mon consent, have one of the most
dynamic economies in the world and
improving general prosperity and
living standards. We are also on the
verge of a potentially huge sea-
change in Europe, centered around
monetary union. The choice is
whether we stick with the party that
gave us the current economic condi-
tions or change. In that most British
of ways, do we 'give the other lot a
chance'?
It would be churlish and incorrect of
me to suggest that Labour have not
changed. Or rather, the Labour lead-
ership has changed. Gone is Clause
4 and the calls for re-nationalisation
have changed to an embrace of pri-
vatisation. Calls
for withdrawal
from Europe
with the slogan
'Out of Europe,
into the world'
in the 1975 ref-
erendum cam-
paign have
been replaced
by a desire to
erode the veto
and adopt the
Social Chapter.
Policy pledges
have indeed
changed out of
all recognition,
but one must
ask why and to
what extent
does this shift
represent the
views of the
whole party. In
the light of four
policy U-turns
five days after the publication of a
manifesto that took three years to
write, electoral expediency rather
than convictions seems a fair inter-
pretation. People say that the Tories
and Labour are the same these days.
There are certainly large areas where
Labour appear to have, if not stolen
the clothes, at least swiped the dress-
making patterns. Don't look at the
policy overlap, look at the differ-
Simon Baker
the rea
cand
Labour have a number of key, poten-
tially disas-
trous policies.
First and fore-
most must be
the minimum
wage. Even
John Prescott
has been
forced to admit
that this will
lead to job
losses, though
he didn't sug-
gest how
many. Aside
from the initial
losses caused
by staff cuts,
the long term
effects on
Britain's com-
petitiveness
are far more
serious.
Labour will
counter this
with the old
'sweat-shop economy' argument,
but this is frankly rubbish. Average
annual take-home pay in the U K is
£400 lower than Germany and about
£1,500 higher than France. Note
take-home pay rather than straight
wages, this being due to the far lower
tax burdens on employers and
sonable
idate
employees here. Which brings us
conveniently to the Social Chapter.
Make no mistake, the reason that
Britain attracts more inward invest-
ment than Germany and France
combined is that the costs of
employing someone here are less
than half that in some of our
European partners. Where the US
have created millions of jobs over
the last decade, Europe has managed
to lay off about 15 million people by
a range of policies designed not to
create jobs, but to stave off unem-
ployment, with little success. Labour
are keen to sign up to the regulator's
charter, displaying all the worst
excesses of big government and state
control. Steering clear of the disaster
that is monetary union won't stop
Toyota investing here, huge addi-
tional costs will.
I could go on, but space does not per-
mit. Reading the Labour manifesto,
one finds grand soundbites by the
cartload- dramatically improving
education (cutting £180 million from
the assisted places scheme), rebuild-
ing the NHS by cutting admin (sav-
ing 0.3% of the budget) and so on.
The Conservatives, surprisingly it
must be said, have proposed some
genuinely radical policies- privatisa-
tion of state pensions, transfer of tax
allowances from unworking spouses
to their working partners and reduc-
ing business rates for small business-
es. Ladies and gentlemen, it's over to
you.
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
A letter in the last edition of Felix
raised some interesting questions
about political bias in this newspa-
per, accusing my fellow columnist
and I of partisan reporting, and hop-
ing we'd all be gagged in the run-up
to the election in six days time (I
guess it didn't have the desired
effect). Imperial College Union, of
which this paper is a part of, has
charitable status like most other stu-
dent unions and cannot therefore
sanction any political creed or party
without jeopardising its charitable
status.
All this means in practice is that
the entire editorial content of the
paper must not be in support of a par-
ticular party, and headlines such as
'Everyone vote for X ' would get
everyone into trouble.
Many people have asked me who
I'm going to vote for, where I stand
in it all, and even who they should
vote for. Well, vote for whoever the
hell you want! Anyone who has the
brains to study at Imperial should
sensibly make up their mind as to
who they want to run the country for
five years.
The only big recommendation I
would make is that you do vote,
because if you abstain on the
grounds that 'it wouldn't make any
difference anyway' then you should-
n't complain when a party you dis-
like comes into power. Those who
do not vote have no voice. Party
strategists, when deciding policy,
take into account the fraction of
affected areas of the population who
turn out to vote. If particularly few of
them turn out each election, they will
be a 'soft spot' for unpleasant legis-
lation which gains them votes with
people who do turn out to vote.
Campaigns such as 'Rock the vote'
are trying to increase the influence of
the younger generation by making
them turn out to vote. If there is an
increase this election of young peo-
ple voting, the mainstream parties
will be pressured to re-jig their poli-
cies to keep the young behind them.
The state of higher education and the
continual assault on student's wallets
demonstrate the paucity of the stu-
dent vote.
If you are voting in the Cites of
London and Westminster constituen-
cy, it may be wise to read last term's
interview with the main candidates,
Peter Brooke, Kate Green and Mike
Dumigan. The vote you make will be
for a particular person to represent
you and this geographic area in
Parliament, as well as giving a party
an extra vote in the passing of Bills
through the Commons. There are
many people who dislike a party but
like their candidate enough to vote
for him/her despite his/her alle-
giance, and vice-versa. Do take care
of your vote as this is probably your
last one until 2002, when most of
you will have graduated, and could
well working full-time with a mort-
gage and family!
Finally, a number of people
including a certain other nameless
Felix columnist and the person writ-
ing the 'political bias' letter seem to
think I write under a pseudonym.
Well I don't. I actually live with this
name, thank you. And remember to
vote on the 1 st of May.
The real, live and kicking Hamish
Common's Westminster Eye will be
appearing intermittently over the
next few weeks due to exams.
