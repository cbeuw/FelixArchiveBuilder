Meet Claire
and Tom
They've found an easy way of seeing
West End shows for half price
How do they manage it? They both recently joined ArtSoc. ArtSoc arranges
tickets for West End shows, at hugely reduced prices.
By block booking tickets, ArtSoc can
usually save Claire and Tom 30-50%
off the regular price of shows.
As well as the big musicals like
Sunset Boulevard and Les Miserables,
they've seen plays like The Shallow
End and The Woman in Black, and
they've even been to Carmen at the
f ' Royal Albert Hall.
And because ArtSoc has over 200
members, Claire and Tom also find
it a great way of meeting people.
Come along to one of our meetings
at any time between 12:30-l:30pm
on Mondays in the Union Dining Hall.
Some of the shows coming up in the summer term include:
• Starlight Express by Andrew Lloyd Webber: £10.50 reduced from £30
- 65% off the most expensive seats in the house!
• Popcorn by Ben Elton: date and price TBA
- "an outrageously funny, gripping and thought-provoking play"
• Art by Yasmina Reza: date and price TBA
- winner of Best Comedy Laurence Oliver Award
