6 GENERAL ELECTION FEATURE F E L I X FRIDAY 2 5 T H APRIL
Like us and everyone else in the country, by now you must be sick and tired of the
banal rubbish that the General Election campaign has produced. To save your sanity,
here at Felix we have devised a cunning remedy for those Election Night blues (and
reds, purples, yellows, greens, off-whites or whatever): the Felix General Election
