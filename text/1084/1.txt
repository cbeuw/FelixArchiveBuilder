Confusion haunts exams in Great Hall
MATTHEW BENNETT
The summer exam season has started
with confusion for students and some
tutors as the location of hundreds of
exams that were timetabled to take
place in the Great Hall has been
changed at the last minute.
All exams from 28th April are to
be relocated following the revelation
that the noise from building works in
the Library penetrates into the hall
causing unnecessary disruption to
candidates. This action was decided
on in preference to postponing con-
struction work, which would cost the
College several hundred thousand
pounds in delays and wages.
After much discussion, College
authorities have decided that the
exams are going to be relocated to a
"rigid-structured temporary mar-
quee" in Prince's Gardens, with no
timing changes foreseen. Ian
Caldwell, Director of the Estates
Division, explained: "We felt it was
better to relocate the exams rather
than retimetable, because students,
staff and examiners will be geared up
to a specific time and date and what-
ever we do, we do try to minimise the
disruption on the College communi-
ty"
In a letter to all students, Soosan
Oldroyd, Assistant registrar for
Examinations, explained the reasons
behind the relocation. She also urged
students to "accept the College's
apologies for any inconvenience
caused." However, apologies came
too little and too late for some stu-
dents. "I think that in one of the top
four universities [sic] in the country,
the fact students who are taking
exams are being treated this way is
absolutely disgusting," said one stu-
dent from Linstead Hall, "it's a joke.
We deserve better."
Exams were relocated away from
Civil Engineering earlier this year
due to the noise from the BMS build-
ing, but the problem in the Great Hall
was not noticed until the Easter vaca-
tion. This has meant that this weeks'
exams have not been repositioned,
but the work has been allowed to
"suffer" instead, according to Mr
Caldwell.
He went on to explain how the
work had been planned from the start
to cause minimum disruption to
exam candidates, with work in the
northern section of the library being
postponed until the holidays.

Wake sees off Union Bookshop
NEWSTEAM
The last day of term before the
Easter vacation saw around fifty
Imperial College students attend a
mock funeral procession intended to
mark the 'death' of Imperial College
Union's bookstore, the contract to
supply academic texts on campus
having been previously awarded to
booksellers Waterstone's.
Shortly before one o'clock on
Friday 21st March, student represen-
tatives, dressed mainly in black,
gathered in the middle of a brightly
sunlit Beit Quad. Bemused onlook-
ers gazed up from their pound cur-
ries and lunchtime pints as a coffin,
supplied by the students' Dramatic
Society and labelled 'RIP the Union
bookstore', was hoisted by four suit-
ed pall-bearers.
Accompanied by funereal march-
es from a solemnly borne Compact
Disc player, the coffin, at the head of
a column of sombre students, pro-
ceeded at a slow and measured pace P H O T O : ROBIN
