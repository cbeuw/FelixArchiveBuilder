Planet Science
parlier this month, New Scientist magazine relaunched
Cits world wide web site, Planet Science. The new
'improved' look is very different, all the colourful icons that
used to welcome you to Plane! Science have gone. In
their place is an image of the front cover from the latest
issue, and lots of text. This pared down style is reminis-
cent of the on-line versions of other science magazines,
notably New Scientist's big brothers, Nature and Science.
Try to spot the difference opposite... However, the web
pundits at New Scientist claim tthey have been slaving
over a hot mouse for weeks, to bring their readers more
content, rather than style, with lots of new features.
So how does Planet Science at http://www.newscien-
tist.com compare to the web pages of other science
magazines? Well they all contain selected material from
their respective publications, as well as special web fea-
tures on hot topics, such as genetic cloning or the search
for life on Mars. A useful feature of all the web pages are
searchable jobs, courses and meetings databases, such
as New Sc/enfefs http://www.sciencejobs.com. So is
this an example of cloning on the internet, or does Planet
Science now have more to offer?
Most of the extra features of Planet Science are found
in the new NSplus section, which has material only found
on the web. The supplementary material includes new
sections on background reading, anything internet relat-
ed (surprise, surprise) and lots of puzzles, with, for the first
time, explanations of how they can be solved.
Two new sections worth a second look are Btteback
and Grand-Tours. Biteback is your chance to join in lively
discussions that started on the New Scientist's letters
pages. Grand-tours is the first on-line travel guide to sites
of special scientific interest. This section is also supposed
to be animated - if you have a browser that supports
Shockwave - although they claim to be working on a ver-
sion that doesn't require any plugins.
The best new feature of Planet Science is for anyone
who likes to have the Last Word. Readers of the maga-
zine will already be familiar with the question and answer
section which deals with general queries from readers
about absolutely anything science related, such as why
eggs are egg-shaped.
This is an area where the internet really comes into its
own. It is invaluable for settling family disputes. There's no
longer a need for heated arguments about whether the
actress in Green Card was Andie MacDowell or Anne
Stuart Masterton. Simply fire up the nearest modem, type
the words 'Green Card' into a web search engine, and
any number of homepages by movie buffs will settle the
matter once and for all.
The Last Word archive at Planet Science should
become the place to look for answers to all those intrigu-
ing science and technology questions. If you've been
wondering how those widgets in the bottom of beer cans
work, whether fish fart or why men have nipples, then
wait no longer. Head straight for http://www.last-
word.com. And if the answer isn't among the existing
350 Q&A's, simply pose a new question of your own.
