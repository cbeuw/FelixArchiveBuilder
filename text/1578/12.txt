Don’t want to fist before marriage, that’s special stuff
Filling in this survey has filled me with wank shame
I once used so much mint lube on a guy, I slid off his chest and on to
the floor
I can nibble tits until the girl cums, it has been scientifically proven

A generous 32% of students do “some-
times” send explicit pictures to others,
whilst a further 5% do so “frequently.”
However a resounding 63% seem to have
a clean photo gallery, and have never sent
any explicit photos before.
This varies wildy when
considering relationship
status, although not as
you might first think. Out
of those who are seeing
multiple people, 71% of them send explicit
photos, whereas out of those who consider
themselves to be in an exclusive relation-
ship, only 43% do so. It seems that dirty
photos are either only used to attract
attention and then are considered too time
consuming for ongoing, steady partners, or
sneaky snapchats are just driving potential
bed mates away altogether.
It may simply also be that
photos are not our style;
56% of students have sent
dirty text messages “some-
times” whilst a further 10%
do so frequently. It seems that the pen (or
predictive text) is mightier than the sword
(or a dick pic).

So just how kinky are Imperial students?
Are we are angels in the library but devils
in the bedroom?
38% of students responded that they
have tried improvised restraints, with a
further 35% admitting that they would like
to give it a shot. It seems
the fun stops there though.
Restraining bed-mates is
one thing, but whipping
and spanking were not a
big hit. 44% of students
polled were found to be
against trying any sort of whipping or
spanking, whilst only 21% were interested
in having a crack at it.
Interestingly, as a student body we aren’t
a fan of sex toys, with 69% of students
owning no sex toys at all. For those that
do, it was a fairly equal split between
those that enjoy sharing and those that
prefer to keep their toys to themselves.
43% of students polled said that they
used sex toys on both themselves and
their partner, whist 38% of the total
number of students who own sex toys
said they simply kept their toys to them-
selves.
It seems gender is a big
influence in whether or not an
Imperial student agrees that
sharing is caring. Out of the
females that own sex toys,
61% preferred to use their
toys solely for themselves,
whilst only 17% of males did the same.
It seems that we like our sex like we like
our equations here at Imperial; uncompli-
cated, simple to solve and with minimal
variables. However, it may be that we just
didn’t ask the right questions – these are
limited topics in the world of sexual devi-
ancy, and there may be an unnoticed,
unifying kink students are yet to admit to.
