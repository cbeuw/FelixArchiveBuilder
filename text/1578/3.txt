R
ecent visitors to Beit
Quad will have noticed
the appearance of signs
reminding visitors that
only alcohol bought from
the Union outlets may be consumed
in Beit Quad. his is the latest
manifestation in the Union eﬀorts
this year to make sure it complies with
licensing laws and its own retail of
alcohol policy which explicitly states
that: “No externally purchased alcohol
may be brought onto the Union’s
premises for consumption”.
When asked for clariﬁcation over
what areas of the Union are covered
by the Union’s license Felix was told
that the consumption of alcohol
anywhere in the Union building or the
Beit Quadrangle relates to the license.
Imperial College Union’s Venue
Manager – when asked how the license
eﬀects the consumption alcohol in the
Beit Quad – said that whilst there are
many aspects of alcohol retail that are
not explicitly spelled out in the license,
the consumption of alcohol in the Beit
Quadrangle eﬀects the Union in many
ways including in its duty of care to
students and in its business decisions.

ext Wednesday
members of College
staﬀ and construction
managers will meet in
the Union Dining Hall
to provide feedback on the progress
of the construction of new halls of
residence, in Acton.
hemeeting,attendedbyJaneNeary,
Director of Campus Services; Paul
Noke, Head of Residential Services
and GradPad; and Toni Byrne-Price,
Project Director from Berkley First,
gives students the chance to provide
input on the project’s ﬁnal design
stage, which will aﬀect the use of some
of the spaces and the look and feel of
the new residence.
he new hall, currently referred
to as “One Victoria Road”, was the
target of a student campaign last year
against the creation of a large halls
of residence in North Acton, will be
located approximately ﬁve miles from
campus and is expected to house upto
700 undergraduate students.
he halls are expected to be
complete by the end of next academic
year, providing bed spaces to replace
those removed by the potentially
temporary closure of Evelyn Gardens
(as reported by Felix in March) at the
end of the 2014-15 academic year.
he meeting will take place on
Wednesday 5th June at 5:00PM at
the Union Dining Hall, and light
refreshments will be provided.
I
mperial physicist Sir John
Pendry was this week
announced as joint winner of
the $1 Million Kavli prize for his
groundbreaking work in optics.
Pendry is most famous as the inventor
of the world’s ﬁrst working invisibility
cloak, a product of his work on meta
materials. Meta materials are unique
in having a negative refractive index.
he refractive index of a piece of
glass is the Sine of the angle of a ray
of light going into the glass divided by
the Sine of its angle going out, telling
you how much the glass bends light. A
negative refractive index is then a very
strange thing indeed, where the angle
of incidence is greater than the angle
of refraction, allowing light to be bent
in very precise ways.
In the case of Pendry’s invisibility
cloak, light rays are bent around the
material, recombining when they
leave as if they were travelling in a
straight line the whole time, leaving
the material invisible to a distant
observer.
Another Imperial physicist, Martin
McCall, extended this to the idea
of a SpaceTime invisibility cloak,
obscuring events. Unlike Pendry’s,
this hasn’t actually been made. he
Pendry cloak currently only works at
microwave frequencies but work is
underway to extend it to visible light.
Sir Pendry is also known for his
theoretical work in predicting a
perfect lens, which he demonstrated
with a 4 page paper in 2000. he paper
was so short that many refused to
believe he could have demonstrated
such a revolutionary idea, securing his
place as one of the greatest physicists
in the country. He shares the prize
with two other scientists and will be
awarded it at a special ceremony by
the king of Norway. Sir Keith O’Nions
last week called Pendry “one of the
great Imperial scientists of all time”.
London commented: “I am absolutely
delighted at this extremely generous
donation that will push forward
research in an exciting and crucially
important area of medical science.
Biomedical engineering is improving
treatments and quality of life for
people aﬀected by a diverse range
of medical conditions and this new
centre has the potential to beneﬁt
millions in the UK and around the
world. his donation, coming so
soon after the launch of MedCity,
demonstrates unquestionably that
London and the South East is one of
the leading regions in the world for
game-changing science.”
Sir Keith O’Nions, Rector of
Imperial College, sent an email to staﬀ
at the College saying: “he Michael
Uren Biomedical Engineering Hub
will enable engineers and medics
to come together and make new
technologies, discoveries and
innovations on an unparalleled
scale – cementing Imperial and the
UK’s position as world-leaders in
biomedical engineering.”
Michael said: “What I ﬁnd so
exciting about this project is that here
is Imperial building one of the biggest
research centres in the world within
a few miles of the City of London,
which itself has become the biggest
ﬁnancial centre in the world today. By
putting the two together, what is quite
clear is that the investment world will
be watching for, and waiting for, the
research and inventions which will
create tomorrow’s great companies.”
“Imperial was inspirational when I
ﬁrst joined it as a young engineering
student in 1940, when London was
under attack every night, and it is
inspirational today. May it continue
to be so forever.”

F
ollowing a large number of
meetingsbeingcancelled,the
Union Executive Committee
has met for only the second
time this academic year.
Charged with overseeing the general
running of the Union and enacting
policies of Union Council, Exec is
scheduled to meet once a month.
However this year a lack of agenda
items has led to most of the meetings
being cancelled: the other meet took
place until January.
When asked why a lack of agenda
items seems to be an on-going
problem with Exec, David Goldsmith,
Union President and Chair of Exec,
said that the Committee probably
needs to have the scope of work
reviewed. his is despite the fact
that last year in the same period last
year Exec met 9 times. he lack of
meetings has led to what little items
of business there were being decided
on by electronic vote, which has lead
to some concerns over how the Union
records such decisions.
T
he Oxford Union (OUSU)
has declared last week’s vote
on whether to continue to
affiliate with the National
Union Students void amid
controversy over “ballot stuffing”. he
‘no’ vote had won the referendum by a
slender 128 votes last week, but it has
since emerged that more than 1000
votes for ‘no’ were submitted from
the same IP address, in batches, with
unique voter codes that hadn’t yet
been assigned to any members of the
union.
Jack Matthews, the leader of the
Oxford University Conservative
Association and the leader of the
‘no’ campaign brought the evidence
forward, who noticed that 23,000
voter codes had been assigned, when
the electorate is in fact only 21,500.
Returning Officer Alexander Walker
has since resigned his position, citing
it as “untenable”.
OUSU president Tom Rutland has
said that he will bring the motion to
council to stay with the NUS, as, after
discounting invalid votes, more than
70% had voted to remain affiliated to
the NUS.
