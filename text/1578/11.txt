Imperial College has taught how to live as a chaste monk
Everyone on my snapchat gets my dictures!
Once, we made a laptop screen move back and forth in the room
next to ours in halls.
I should probably become a lesbian

The majority of students who took the
survey (64.3%) lost their virginity before
their 19th birthday, with only 14.6%
students losing their virginity while
students at College (i.e.
have joined in the last
four years and are
between the ages of 18
and 22). The most popular age for losing
one’s virginity was 18, corresponding to the
experiences of 23.3% respondents.
10.4% of students who took to survey are
still virgins, of whom 17% claim religion as a
factor in their virgin status. We asked Impe-
rial’s student virgins about the non-mutually
exclusive factors that have kept their virgini-
ty intact and it transpired that 59.2% of
virgins haven’t met the right person yet,
15.8% are waiting for marriage, 14.5% are
apparently too busy
being a World of
Warcraft Guild Leader
(Yes, you read that
correctly), and 23.7% don’t know why.
Finally, in terms of virginity, of the virgins on
campus, 65.8% believe that one can still be
a virgin after giving/receiving a manual
stimulation (read: a helping hand), while
only 14.47% believe the same applies after
hypothetically giving or receiving oral sex.
This should be a quickie. We asked students if
they have ever had a one-night stand. Of the
surveyed population the
answers were relatively closely
matched, with 39.2% of
respondents being one-night
stand virgins and 48.9%
having taken part in an impromptu nocturnal
liaison at least once.
Of our one-night stand adventurers, women
counted for 36.5% of responses, while men
contributed 61.6%, but within their genders,
50.6% of women had
at least one
one-night stand
closely compared to
47.8% of men.
During the event itself women orgasm 15.8%
of the time, a number outstriped by the male
equivalent, a substantially larger 64.4%.
Of those who took the survey, 19.2%
of you took the bold step of asking
your partner for a
threesome, while
31.1% claim to
have been asked.
However, this makes dismal viewing
compared to the number who have
sealed the deal, with only 12.7%
taking the tricycle belt of Barney
Stinson. The balance between
genders on
this topic is
fairly even,
with 12.0% of
female respondents saying that they
have engaged in a ménage a trois,
compared against 11.3% of males.
As some of those who play in Sports teams
may say,“What goes on tour stays on tour”!
According to our records, a surprising 1 in 5
(22.2%) of Imperial students have cheated
on a partner.
Out of those of you who fancy yourselves as
sneaky in the realm of love
as Mad Max of Eastenders’
fame, almost half (48.9%)
(94) of you were found out,
with 75.5% of you confessing, 8.5% being
caught and 16.0% being rumbled by a third
party.
When the shoe was on the other foot, 20.3%
of students have admitted to being aware of
the fact that a partner has been unfaithful, of
whom 34.1% heard from somebody else
while 45.9% were told by the partner in
question.
Interestingly, people who have been cheat-
ed on are twice as likely (37.6%) to cheat on
a partner than those
who havent (18.4%).
Finally, looking at
the gender ratio,
18.5% of men admitted to cheating on a
partner, compared to 30.0% of women,
although to be fair, at Imperial they have a
wider, if not better selection to choose from,
comparatively.
It’s back again, better, brighter and with more questions!
We’ve managed to analyse the data from the 2014 sex survey
and are happy to bring you the results in this 4 page
pullout.
This year 734 out of 9,915 students (undergraduate,
postgraduate taught and postgraduate research combined) took
part in the survey, representing 7.5% of the population.
This year’s survey included a larger range of carefully thought out
questions that enabled us to ind out some more interesting
information about the sex lives of students at College.
We hope you enjoy reading about what you and your
classmates get up to behind closed doors (or in some cases,
out in the open!)
If we are simply just logging of to ind love,
are we at least logging on
to, well, get of? 29% of
students apparently
never watch porn, 4% of
students watch porn
once a week, around 20% of students watch
porn 2 to 5 times a week, and 12% of
students watch porn between 5 and 10 times
a week. That’s at least once every
weekday, and presuming they
have the weekend of to give their
bandwidth a break.
Out of those that didn’t watch
porn, 62% were women, and only 11% were
men.
Are we using screens to show of our assets?
A generous 32% of students do“sometimes”
send explicit pictures to others, whilst a
further 5% do so“frequently.”However a
resounding 63% seem to have a clean photo
gallery, and have never
sent any explicit
photos before.
However, this wildly
varies when considering relationship status,
although not as you might irst think. Out of
those who are seeing multiple people, 71%
of them send explicit photos, whereas out of
those who consider themselves to be in an
exclusive relationship, only 43% do so. It
seems that dirty photos are either only used
to attract attention and then are considered
too time consuming for ongoing, steady
partners, or sneaky snapchats are just driving
potential bed mates away alto-
gether.
Interestingly 6.9% of respondents
have send pictures to people they
have never met, while 9.0% have sent sexts
or explicit pictures to people other than a
partner during a relationship, a result that
may prompt a few awkward conversations
over the weekend.

DISCLAIMER
There are few caveats to recognise when analysing the Sex Survey data:
1. The survey data may be biased by its very nature, for instance people who are not sexually active
may have felt discouraged from filling out the results, which may lead to an undestimation of some statistics (e.g.
virginity).
2. The spread of responses varies by department, one department registered less than 10 respondents,
while others counted over 100. This may skew data analysed on a departmental basis and makes some data
points unreliable.
3. Some people may not have fully trusted the anonymity of the data and may have moderated answers
to avoid embarrassment.
