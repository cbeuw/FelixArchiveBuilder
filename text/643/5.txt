Southside Security
I continue to receive abuse when
I refuse to let strangers follow
me in to Southside unless they
can produce a Unioncard despite
this being supposedly the most
important rule necessary to keep
potential rapists at bay.
Apart from this I have received
no feedback at all. Doesn't
anyone else find the security
arrangements as ridiculous as I?
If not, please say so and I'll shut
up; until then, though, I'll
continue to grouse and leave
people locked outside.
Incidentally the large convex
mirror in the foyer of Selkirk
and Keogh has been angled
upwards for several months now.
This means that it is no longer
possible to check for muggers
waiting in the lifts, but it is
possible to see if anyone is
lurking crouched on top of the
entrance doors, waiting to spring
down on an unsuspecting victi....
Firstly, before I leave this
subject, I know there are two
security guards in Southside who
are extremely conscientious
about their work, and who were
upset at certain remarks I made
last week which might have
implied that all the Southside
security staff are lazy and
inefficient. I hope the two who
are not will accept my apologies
for any embarrassment this
caused.

AN AMUSING BIT of nonsense
from Mr John Thole reached me
last week. Mr Thole is a lecturer
in the Department of Humani-
ties and possibly is one of the
few people in College who have
any real say in the IC musical
sphere.
College has a number of music
practice rooms in the basement
of the Department of Humani-
ties, and Mr Thole is in charge of
their administration. Until this
term anyone who wanted to use
a practice room had to get a key
from the messengers in Mech
Eng.
But Mr Thole has now changed
the system slightly, and a letter
from him sent out during the
vacation to all authorised users
of practice rooms says that in
future a special pass will be
necessary before a key can be
issued.
Passes will be necessary, this
letter says, from Monday April
25. But later on in the letter we
read that passes will not be
available until the afternoon of
Wednesday April 27.

EDITORIAL
FELIX Features
I wrote last week about how
regular features tend to become
emaciated over the summer.
Instead, though, I have plans for
several biggish feature articles
which will appear throughout
the rest of term. Next week's
FELIX will include a special
CND feature, with an article by
Rob Kelsey, an interview of two
of the authors of London After
The Bomb, and various other
relevant bits.
The following week there will
be a FELIX investigation into
the College telephone system
and the week after I shall give
you all the grisly details of my
parachute jump.
If you have any other sug-
gestions for features, especially if
you'd like to write one yourself,
do please look in and discuss
your ideas. I'll be more than
ready to give whatever help I
can.
Cheap Clothes
Easy Garments UK Ltd are
planning to sell off container
remnants, ends of lines, and
seconds in the JCR in the near
future.
They will be selling a range of
different .garments, and in
particular their jeans, at £5.99,
came out as best for value and
quality in a recent Which?
report.
If the sale is a success it may
be possible to arrange similar
projects in future, so do go along
and at least see what's on offer.
The only problem is the date: I
have been given two sets of dates
for the sale, so it will be from
11:30am to 2:00pm on either
May 11 and 12 or May 18 and
19. Sorry I can't be more helpful.
FELIX Car Rally
In previous years this has only
been publicised at the last
minute, so hardly anyone has
entered. This year you have no
such excuse, and if you will have
access to a car and a group of
friends on June 19 and would
enjoy motoring round London
answering silly questions and
gathering treasure first thing on
a Sunday morning, then the
FELIX car rally is for you. More
details will appear nearer the
date, but in the meantime, keep
the morning free.
Photographs
Last term several people brought
films in to FELIX to be de-
veloped and then asked for
prints from the negatives. I was
very lax about processing some
of these films, and those I did
often became separated from the
contact sheet, making it difficult
to find the original negative.
Consequently most requests
were met with 'Come back next
term when I'll have had time to
sort out the file.' Well, I've kept
my word, and the photographs
are now all beautifully arranged
as far as possible in sequence
with the negatives paired off
with the corresponding contact
sheet. So now you can see the
results of the film you exposed
last January, and even order
prints from it, too!
Impossible Without
Gastropod, Bow-tie, Pinocchio,
Walkabout-Looksee, Chris
Mallaband, and various others
with unlikely names, Nick
Bedding, Lee Paddon, Adrian
and Lynne James (no relation),
Hugh Southey (no relation
either), Jon Barnett, Diane
Love, Paul Phillipou, Peter
Hobbis, Peter Rodgers, Nick
Pyne, Andy Wood, Maz and
Pete the Print.
Special thanks to all those
who (knowingly or unknow-
ingly) helped Mike from QEC;
to those who didn't meet him—
you have been warned!

W H E N I W A S young and
impressionable, about 6 months
ago, I used to be hugely flattered
by important-looking bits of
paper whicn would arrive in the
F E L I X Office headed 'Press
Release'. Here, I thought, was a
communication from someone
who recognised the importance
of student newspapers in the
business world, someone who
has something worthwhile to
say, yet is not too proud to
conceal it from the lower
echelons of the world's press,
someone fair-minded enough to
give a fair crack of the whip to
each and every station of the
fourth estate, however humble it
may be.
I was wrong. Now that I am a
disillusioned and cynical old
man with six months of diary
column experience behind me, I

I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
have realised the truth behind
these rather pretentious docu-
ments.
Suppose you are, say, a
manufacturer of perspex toilet
seats and you want to bring your
product to the attention of as
large a body of people as
possible, using the press as your
medium. The best way is to
produce a slick advertisement,
well designed, with lots of
photographs and diagrams, and
then to pay the horrendous
advertising charges levied by the
Sunday supplements to publish
it. Unfortunately you can't
possibly afford all this. The best
you can manage is a roughly
typed handout on your com-
pany's headed notepaper. What
to do? Suddenly the idea comes
to you. Heading your handout
'Press Release' you pad it out
with the kind of jargon press
releases contain. You replace the
word continued at the foot of
each page with the word MORE
in capitals, and at the end you
write —END— as if it were a
computer program. (Witho'ut
this terminating construction,
one assumes that a hapless
mechanical reader would scour
the rest of the letter looking for
more text and would eventually
start again at the beginning,
condemned to sit forever in an
END-less loop reading about
perspex toilet seats.)
Finally, as your master stroke,
you don't send your press release
to the national press where it will
be carefully and promptly filed
under WPB; instead you must
send it to the student press
where, with luck, a young and
impressionable editor, short of
copy, will be hugely flattered by
your interest, and will give you
rather more space than reader
interest merits.
I had planned to expand on
this subject for another few
columns, but space is getting
prohibitive, so I'll continue this
topic next week when you can
expect
