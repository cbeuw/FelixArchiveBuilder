The Lauwerys Report on Student Residence has
been described as one of the most ludicrous
documents the Sherfield Administration has
produced. Here Selkirk Subwarden Ken Baldwin
analyses its strengths and weaknesses, and puts an
alternative viewpoint.
On the Sharp End
of Student
Residence
The recent review of College student residence known as the Lauwerys
Report has already provoked some discussion in these pages.
Naturally—since after examinations and the sexual imbalance the
begiggest worry for IC students is accommodation. However the
limited circulation of the Lauwerys Report has meant that its
implications have not been made apparent to the vast majority of
students. This is why this article has been written.
But why not just write a letter
to the editor? The reason is this:
no subwardens were consulted in
the report, no subwardens
appeared on the distribution list,
and no subwardens were asked
for comments on its recom-
mendations. Yet the Lauwerys
Report recognises the special
role subwardens have to play in
residence, living as they do
amongst the student population.
It is the subwardens who are on
the sharp end of student resi-
dence, while it is the wardens
who take the overall responsibi-
lity. Now that I'm nearing the
end of my time as subwarden it
would be easy to let all this slip
by, but to do that would be to
devalue much of what I've pul
into the last three years. So
Soapbox provides the oppor-
tunity to express my accummu-
lated thoughts on student
residence and simultaneously
comment on the timely release of
this residence report.
The Lauwerys Report is one
of those documents which are
hard to condemn or praise as a
whole. It has many good points,
not the least of which is its
c o m m i t m e n t to e x p a n d i n g
student accommodation. But it
is a c u r i o u s l y inconsistent
document, with the recom-
mendations sometimes contra-
dicting completely the discussion
leading up to it. Two examples
will serve to illustrate this:
Observation: In the difficult
financial climate the residences
must take second place to the
College's teaching and research
activities.
Recommendation: Appoint an
expensive (£16,000pa) Resi-
dential Services Manager (RSM)
to administer the residences.
My comment: The last thing
residences need is a high-price
bureaucrat, out of touch with
residence life, to dictate how-
residences should run. Closer
consultation with wardens (who
together with their housekeepers
and subwardens are much better
able to judge the needs of the
Halls or Houses) is what is needed,
needed.
Observation: Wardens and
subwardens are essential for
1981). The financial saving of
the current reduction after the
RSM's salary has been deducted
is a paltry £6,000pa—at the
sacrifice of the wellbeing of
1.400 students. Is the possibility
of one breakdown or suicide
attempt worth this much?
Furthermore the report re-
commends that postgrads now
become eligible for Hall warden-
ships. Not only do most post-
grads lack the experience for the
job. but they simply cannot
afford the time to take total
responsibility for the running of
The Lauwerys Report is a curiously inconsistent
document; its recommendations sometimes completely
contradict its conclusions. It says that because of
financial constraints residence must take second place
to teaching, then recommends the appointment of a
manager at a salary of £16,000. It says that wardens are
essential for social life in Halls, then recommends that
wardens be cut by a third. In other areas the report
simply sidesteps issues completely.
welfare, discipline and social life
in the Halls.
Recommendation: Cut the
number of wardens and sub-
wardens by a third.
My comment: The last time
Hall wardens were cut I spoke
out against reducing the war-
den/student ratio given the high
pressure e n v i r o n m e n t of a
competitive college located in
Central London (FELIX, May
a hall of nearly 200 students. The
report also cuts the terms of
wardens and subwardens, re-
ducing the stability and con-
tinuity of Hall life to the level of
hostels or barracks. If College is
afraid of vegetating incumbents
then they should make wardens
and subwardens re-apply on
their merits, and thus assure that
good people are not lost through
arbitrary retrenchment.
In other areas the Report
simply sidesteps the issues
entirely. Here is a list of the main
aspects of Hall life for which the
Report's recommendations are
inadequate:
Student Residence Commit-
tee: This is the main body
determining residence policy and
as such should be representative
of all residences. The report
wants to cut the number of
wardens on SRC and replace
them with College appointees,
therebv making it less repre-
sentative. Further, there are no
subwardens' representatives
who, as I have said, are closer to
the student residents almost by
definition. There are no student
residents representatives on the
SRC ar all apart from two union
officials who by their indepen-
dent nature are not always
interested or sympathetic to
residence issues. A representa-
tive from H a l l and House
Chairmen is required here to put
the residents' views—after all
they are the people whom the
College residences serve.
F o o d : This is the biggest
sidestep in the whole document.
The report recognises that
refectory food is mediocre
(appalling would be a better
word) and that this causes
impossible overcrowding in Hall
kitchens not designed for mass
cooking. Instead of calling for
vast improvements in College
catering the report recommends
turning laundries into kitchens,
thereby transferring the over-
