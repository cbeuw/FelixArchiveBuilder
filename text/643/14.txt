President's U G M Report
I. l.auHcrys Report
i have dratted a detailed response to the Lauwerys Report on the future of
residence at Imperial College. The major reason for the report was the
pressure lor highly efficient management brought about by new U G C
regulations concerning the amount of central funds that could be spent as a
dispensation to the residence account. The report had two major themes: (I)
the need to lower the "subsidy' ol residence: 12) the appointment of a
Residential Services Manager.
The College 'subsidy' is substantial (ol the order of £300.000) and does not
include any estimate ot" cost ol administration time to maintain the residence,
lire report r e c o m m e n d e d that this sum s h o u l d be tully isolated a n d
transferred to an independant residence account. This would clearly have an
enormous and unacceptable effect on rent bills over the next few yeas. 1 would
therefore like the U G M to adopt my response to these sections of the report:
Recommendation 4
We have no object to the costs that arise to the College by having Student
Residence being identified. However, this must include some estimate of the
benefits thai accrue lo the College by being able, for example, to offer
incentives 10 all lirst year undergraduates and to some groups of overseas
postgraduates. It is possible that unless the College is prepared to spend a
great deal of administrative time isolating these sums precisely only a very
general estimate will be able to be compiled. 1 would hope that it is the case
that the College charges the residence account a realistic price for services
ottered and. where appropriate credits the residence account with interest
received on the balance held by the College.
Recommendation 5
We icjcci the suggestion that it is possible for the residence account to bear
the lull cost of the removal of the U G C dispensations. There are clear limits
to the extent to which student rents could rise to meet this. The U n i o n would
find it totally unacceptable to allow student rents to rise, in percentage terms,
more than the maintenance grant. In addition the pressures of the market
place would dictate an upper ceiling with places going unfilled. Therefore
money would have to be found by the sale of the assets of the Students
Residence Committee (one assumes that if residence are to be self sufficient
they • • ;
" k
e given the ownership of the H a l l s / H o u s e s ) to fund the shortfall,
this policy would probably be unacceptable to the College. We therefore feel
that this recommendation is completely impractical.
The Residential Services Manager described would take over much of the
r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s of the w a r d e n m a k i n g them merely r e s p o n s i b l e for
pastoral/welfare issues.My response is thus:
Recommendation 17
"lhis is not a recommendation I can comment on in any detail until the
counter proposals have emerged from the H a l l / H o u s e Wardens. However,
the Unions initial reaction is that the case is not proven for an appointment at
that level, file argument that he can be funded out of income found from
reducing W a r d e n s / S u b - W a r d e n s is irrelevant, he should be able to fund
himself through increased Conference/Summer Bookings. We do feel that an
appointment could be made at a lower scale as a manager for the S A C
Scheme which has consistently failed to realise its potential.
1 do feel that there is a need lor a more efficient management of Residences
as a whole hut it is the level of appointment that is at question. We do not
need another desk bound administrator.
2. .Southside Scheme
I will report to the U G M the details of the first phase of the development of
sports facilities in Southside. these will comprise of S a u n a / C h a n g i n g R o o m
lacilities. a G y m , Weights R o o m and a space created for table tennis.
3. Residence
In an attempt lo ascertain student feeling on the linen service 1 have prepared
and distributed a questionnaire. I apologise for ommitting G a r d e n H a l l in the
questionnaire which was prepared at short notice to enable it to be mailed
with residence bills.
4. Ordinary Residence
Sir Keith Joseph has made a statement concerning this matter and has
admitted that L E A s are liable to reconsider claims for compensation from
students who were (in retrospect) classified as Overseas Students. However,
anyone who does feel they are affected should contact their L E A by July 31.
i iiere i.^ no statement yet concerning fees that were paid at the higher rate
bv wrongly classified students. Though the government does intend to foot
the bill.

make a contribution and get a file.
Cost of Living Survey
Some 400 people will have received a cost of living survey please complete and
return it. you may win a bottle of champagne and the information will be of
use to the U n i o n when negotiating things such as rent rises.
D.P's Report
Everything is now drawing to a close, with my exams being imminent.
Consequently I haven't time to write a report for this I G M and every other
meeting and still have time to do anything that Steve has not already pinched
lor his part of the report.
At this precise moment I am engaged in battle with the N a t i o n a l
Westminster Bank concerning the exorbitant bank charges many peole have
just had levied on them in the, current quarter lor being overdrawn for a
couple of days and am hopeful that this situation can be altered.
If I can think of anything else I will tell vou at the U G M .
