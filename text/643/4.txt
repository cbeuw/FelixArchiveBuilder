Eating People
Is Wrong
Dear Sir
After recent detailed research
into socio-masochistic be-
havioural patterns of the praying
mantis, and even in spite of the
dangers of drawing comparisons
between human and animal
activities, we feel compelled by
the overwhelming evidence to
conclude that the dietary supple-
ments of the mantis could be
usefully employed at IC.
The advantages of the imple-
mentation of this policy include
the reduction of student num-
bers vastly in excess of the five
percent recommendation of the
government, without the loss of
academic excellence. Repeated
sexual assaults would be con-
signed to history. And by the
judicious use of the powers
entrusted, would give WIST the
opportunity of becoming a
majority voice in College. ,
The presence of a number of
scared bodies has led us to
believe this practise is already
being undertaken (prempting the
evidence by notably a number of
life scientists).
It is worthy of mention that
those not capable, or desirous of
heterosexual relationships
cannot escape iiie consequences.
Since, in accordance with the
findings of Freud (Vol 7 pp, 116-
117) 'the ingestion of food is
inseparable from sexual activity'
all those eating in College
refectories will inevitably suffer
the same fate as those copu-
lating.
We would be grateful if you
could forward our findings to
the Oxford University Magazine
ISIS as we feel certain it would
simplify their survey.
Yours faithfully

Quran Predicts
Modern Science
Dear Sir
As the mysteries of Creation
are unveiled by Advancing
Science and Technology, ques-
tions such as the Origin of the
Universe and that of man are
slowly being understood.
When the physicists attributed
the origin of the universe to a
'big bang', the students of the
Quran noted that this was
already stated in chapter 21,
verse 30:
'Have not those who dis-
believe known that the heavens
and the earth were one piece,
then we parted them...'
When a biologist tells us that
life originated from the oceans,
we find that this discovery is as
old as the Quran itself:
'and we made every living thing
of water. Will they not then
believe?' 21:30
What I have mentioned above
is just two examples out of a
multitude of examples con-
cerning the Quran.
During a forthcoming lecture
(Thursday May 12, 1:30) you
will be able to witness physical,
touchable, examinable and
perpetual miracles, which prove
that the Quran is indeed the
word of God, and that it comes
to us perfectly preserved.
Yours sincerely
