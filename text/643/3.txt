Bedford and QEC To Be Sold
The main sites at Queen Eliza-
beth College and Bedford
College are to be sold off as part
of London University's cam-
paign of cuts and mergers.
The committee responsible for
the forthcoming merger of QEC,
Kings and Chelsea Colleges has
decided that the valuable site in
Holland Park be sold. In propo-
sals last year to merge QEC and
Imperial College, University
continued from front page
Tower. These contain furnished
flats suitable for four people,
and would have been by far the
most upmarket residences
owned by the College.
An estimated initial income
from the flats of £177,000,
based on £26 per week rent per
student and a large income from
vacation lettings, was compared
with annual expenditure of a
hundred and seventy two thou-
sand. The terms of the lease were
considered unacceptable, how-
ever, the major sticking point
being the College's liability for
repairs. Any structural defects
would have been the lessee's
responsibility, and as the
complex was built mainly with
the notorious high-alumina
crowding problem to the propo-
sed communal college laundry.
Security: Although the Hall
security guards try to provide
cover for the student residences
as much as possible, they just
cannot keep out all undesirables
because of poor arrangements
for entering the buildings. So
what does the report recom-
mend? Cut their numbers in
half! This is lunacy—it invites
the possibility of theft, harass-
ment and rape. What is needed
are manned entrances, with one
guard on constant patrol.
Vacation Accommodation: If
the Lauwerys Report wants to
find the solution to the resi-
dences' financial problems, it
need look no further. That over
1,000 beds regularly lie vacant in
the peak of the summer tourist
season in the centre of London is
almost criminal. Just one night
at £10 a bed would cover the
£6,000 saved by cutting the
number of wardens, who would
then be available for the benefit
of students the rest of the year. It
is to the INCOME side of the
residence account that the report
should be looking, rather than
slashing the expenditure side to
the detriment of the residence
system. To be fair the report
F E L I X H H H M
spokesmen insisted that the site
would be maintained as part of
London University.
Meanwhile, Bedford College
is moving out to Egham in
Surrey where it is joining with
Royal Holloway, and the beauti-
ful buildings in Regent's Park
are to be sold—despite an
agreement that they should be
used only for educational
purposes. Members of the
cement, the College declined to
take the risk of a thirty-five year
lease.
The London School of Eco-
nomics turned down similar
proposals several years ago for
the same reason; the accommo-
dation block bears a thirteen per
cent responsibility for structural
repairs commissioned by the
landlords, and the whole com-
plex is worth some £50m. For a
college to insure against struc-
tural defects would have needed
Treasury approval, which was
refused LSE and would pro-
bably been refused to IC as well.
Michael Arthur, the Student
Services Officer, was told that
these terms would be refused
unless he could substantially

who opposed the merger claim
that they were 'led to believe' by
Vice-Chancellor Quirk, the
moving force behind the mer-
gers, that the Bedford site could
not be sold. But agents are now

States or the Far East.
renegotiate the terms of the
lease, and as the owners of
Centre Point do not seem over
eager to let the accommodation,
this is considered most unlikely.
At the same time, the College
is still considering a proposal to
buy the Fremantle Hotel, which
has been used as a head tenancy
for nearly a year now and is at
present on a three-year lease.
This policy of looking for
accommodation is seen as an
effort to fulfil the promise to
house all first year under-
graduates and overseas post-
graduates in College-owned
property—a major selling point
for universities eager to attract
overseas students and their high
fees.
Aardvark
Never Hurt
Anyone
The University of London I
Union will not be buying an
aardvark, it was formally '
announced last week. During
recent discussions about mas-'
cotry, it was suggested that U L U
should have a mascot, preferably
'something unusual and cuddly',
and naturally a stuffed aardvark
was the first thing to spring to
mind. The idea has, however,
been discarded, owing to ex-
pense and the difficulty of
acquiring a stuffed aardvark on
the open market. A motion to
the U L U General Council,
moving that the President be
mandated to take the proposed
' aardvark on a monthly two-hour
walk, has consequently been
dropped.
The U L U President told
FELIX that there was still a
possibility of the Union sponsor-
ing an aardvark in London
Zoo's 'Adopt an Animal'
scheme, but that really they had
other uses for the money.
does recognise that summer
letting reduces rents by £4 a
week and that more should be
done towards this, but it does not
go far enough. The report
mainly considers conferences in
Halls of Residence, but there is
no reason why all College
accommodation could not be
used to bring income from the
tourist trade or indeed from
anyone who walked in horn the
street. This requires a hard
nosed, commercial attitude from
the conference or SAC officers
towards widely advertising this
central London accommoda-
tion, and there is no need for the
appointment of another bureau-
crat to run it. Only in this way
can student rents be kept down.
There is much more I could
add, and much of what I have
said is oversimplified. But this is
a consequence of this channel of
communication. The residence
system could do with better
representation of the people
most concerned: the students,
wardens and subwardens. So if
Y O U have any constructive
ideas to put forward, then stand
up and be counted—at the
moment College won't stand up
and count 'em for you!
With Deepest
Sympathy...
The Handbook Editor expresses his most heartfelt
condolences to those societies which did not send him an
article for this year's Handbook.
Articles arriving after last month's deadline will be
sent to the Editor of next year's Alternative Prospectus
or (worse still) The Phoenix, unless those societies
affected send their prettiest female member to plead
with him to accept an article. In the case of the Rugby
Club, the Editor will settle for a drink instead.
The Handbook Editor can be found in the FELIX
Office or the Union Bar (waiting for Rugby players to
buy him drinks).
