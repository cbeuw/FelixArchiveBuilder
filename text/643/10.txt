v Hiddy Jahan (both Pakistan)
and England's Lisa Opie v Vicki
Cardwell (Australia). If you find
retrieving or boasting difficult
then the film should certainly
leave you with a few ideas!
The season's ended but the
squash (basketball, ice hockey,
etc) goes on. News in brief: there
are still a few tickets left for the
Harlem Globetrotters at Wem-
bley next Friday evening. (Kick
off is at 7:45pm.) Meet 5:30pm
sharp at IC Sports Centre.
The jumpers will arrive next
week. Half-a-dozen grey sweat-
shirts, with the black T-shirt
logo printed on, have been
ordered and are well worth
considering.
Details of the above are, as
usual, at the Sports Centre.
Finally, any member is welcome,
upon payment of a £36 fully
refundable deposit, to borrow
the Club's ninety-minute video-
cassette recording of the 1982

Dear Tennis Club Members
Last term was quite successful
for the club. The mens firsts
came third in Templar's Winter
League, and did well in friend-
lies. The most notable result was
the 9-0 thrashing of Lough-
borough Seconds.
We have a full calendar of
men's (first and seconds) and
ladies team fixtures this term.
We aim to cap an enjoyable year
with cup success.
I would like to remind all club
members that they may use the
excellent grass courts at Harling-
ton this summer. Coaches are
available on Wednesdays and
Saturdays. Further details are on
the club noticeboard.
Best wishes for the coming
season.

there can be no badminton on
these evenings. However there
is badminton on Tuesday and
Friday evenings in the Volleyball

Thirdly ihe visit by Trinity
College Dublin must be re-
ported, before taster a team
from Trinity played IC in a very
light hearted match. No score
was kept as such, but it was
apparem that IC had lost.
However, i good time was had
in the e
> -ning when a local
hostelry .as patronised. The
' Hrish, used to extortionate prices,
proceede.' to drink far too much
as did Ian. The photographs
prove this £5 for the negatives,
