The Newspaper of Imperial College Union
London Student
Death Threat
London Student, the University
of London newspaper, is fight-
ing moves to close it down. The
paper, which is frequently
accused of appallingly low
journalistic standards, made a
£10,000 loss last year, and in
future ULU wants to curtail this
loss to only £5,000—and since
the newspaper employs two full-
time staff and is printed exter-
nally, this will almost certainly
force it to close down.
A reporter from London
Student described the difficulty
as a 'cash flow problem' and
claimed that the paper cannot be
closed down at once because the
printers require thirteen weeks'
notice. In the meantime, the
price is being altered from a flat
rate of three pence per copy to a
sliding scale on which colleges
buying more copies per student
would pay less. Imperial regu-
larly receives four hundred
copies, most of which are
normally taken by students
before the end of the week.

Imperial College has rejected
terms for a lease on part of the
Centre Point complex, which
might have been used as student
accommodation. At a meeting
this week the committee refused
the offer of accommodation for
144 students in one of London's
most recent landmarks.
Centre Point was built some
twenty years ago at St Giles'
Circus, the intersection of New
Oxford Street and the Totten-
ham Court Road. The main
tower, one of the tallest build-
ings in the West End, was for a
long time looked on as London's
leading white elephant—it has
never been fully occupied.
Although most of the building
consists of office blocks, there is
some residential accommodation
and Imperial was offered six
floors of the annexe, next to the

Jez Goes
to Brighton
Jezebel, the RCS motorised
mascot, completed the London
to Brighton Commercial Ve-
hicles' Run last weekend in a
mere twenty-two hours. This
rather leisurely time was for two
reasons: a scenic detour (minor
navigational error) via East-
bourne on the return journey,
and an impressive list of bits
falling off, including the sump
drain plug.
The participants described the
event as great fun (in retrospect)
and were particularly impressed
by the sight of dawn over
Battersea Bridge on the way
back.
