Obituary:
R O N K I L L
WITH T H E sudden death
earlier this month of Ron
K i l l , Imperial College and
Imperial College Union have
lost a very dear friend. At the
time of his death Ron was a
finalyearpostgraduate student
in the Department of
Chemistry, and the Sub-
Warden of Tizard Hall.
On coming to C o l l e g e in
1970, R o n became heavily
involved in the A s s o c i a t i o n
F o o t b a l l C l u b and despite
living at his home in E n f i e l d
he played regularly for both
the first and second teams.
He maintained h i s interest in
the C l u b throughout his time
at C o l l e g e although the
commitments he was to take
on i n later years was to put
an end to h i s p l a y i n g
career.
R C S Rag
Ron was p l e a s e d to
accept a place in T i z a r d
H a l l for his final year as
an undergraduate, and he
l i v e d there for the rest of
h i s life. Now that he was a
full-time member of C o l l e g e
rather than a commuter he
looked around for things to
f i l l h i s spare time. He was
elected as Secretary to the
H a l l Committee and very
much enjoyed the s o c i a l
life that w.as built around the
h a l l . H a v i n g been elected
as Chemistry third year
Social Representative R o n
became involved i n R C S
Union and was immediately
made Secretaty of the C a r n i v a l
Committee. H e spent many
happy hours working for R C S
R a g , organising c o l l e c t i o n s ,
stunts, and building Rag
floats.
The job of Secretary to
a Committee is often used as
a testing ground, and this
was so with R o n . H i s
previous experience on the
Carnival Committee made him
a strong candidate for the
V i c e - P r e s i d e n c e of R C S
U n i o n . He w a s elected to
that post in the summer of
1973. Immediately after his
e l e c t i o n he took part i n the
Great Tartan R a c e in which
teams raced a barrel from
Edinburgh to London and
tried to raise as much money
for charity as they could
en route. R C S came a
creditable third. H i s year as
V i c e - P r e s i d e n t was a very
s u c c e s s f u l one although it
was marred by arguments
within the E x e c u t i v e .
At the end of the 1973-74
A c a d e m i c year R o n was
elected Deputy President
o f I C U n i o n a n d w a s
appointed Sub-Warden of
T i z a r d H a l l . It i s in respect
of these two positions that
most people outside h i s
department w i l l remember
him. During his year as
Deputy President R o n
managed to put the Union
back onto a planned c y c l e
of redecoration and refurnish-
ing. He also played a very
full and very w e a l part on the
E x e c u t i v e of the Union and
despite the friction it
sometimes caused he was
very outspoken. I know that
he w i l l be remembered as a
'Ron Kill will be remembered as a fine
administrator and one of the best Deputy
Presidents by all those in the Union Office'
fine administrator and one
of the best Deputy P r e s i d e n t s
by a l l those in the Union
O f f i c e . Ron very much
enjoyed his time as Sub-
Warden of T i z a r d H a l l . He
believed that the H a l l should
always be run by the students,
and that he was there both
to encourage them to more
activity, and also to restrain
them when he felt they
were getting out of hand.
Under his guidance and
with the help of many
enthusiastic students the
H a l l seems to have had two
successful years.
It was t y p i c d of his
sensible character that R o n
should choose to spend h i s
final P h D year out of
" p u b l i c l i f e " working hard
at his thesis. T h i s was
almost completed when he
died. He had a very bright
future in Chemistry and had
received job offers from
Cambridge University and
Southampton University.
Great L o s s
I am sure that many people
in the C o l l e g e w i l l have
fond memories of R o n and
would like to join me in
sending condolences to h i s
family, and to Ruth, his
fiancee, who he should have
married at the end of this
weekend. We have a l l
suffered a very sad l o s s .
P E T E R R T E A G U E
President
Imperial College Union
Despite the fact that I am
working my'fingers to the bone
throughout the day in Harrods
(known to some as Boots
Provincial) thi-s long awaited
P G issue has finally hit the
press. Many did not think that
they would live to see it -
that may be true of the Union
Handbook, but it certainly isn't
where F E L I X is concerned. So,
dismissing the sceptics with
no more ado, I shall proceed to
the content of my last (honest)
Editorial.
The Summer Accommodation
Centre scheme is running into
a few sticky patches this year.
I hear that there have been one
or two words exchanged on the
subject of left-over meal tickets;
surely the question is not
whether students should be able
to use them or not, but why
there are so many left over at
a". On good authority we hear
the quality of the food is this
year better than ever before, so
it can't be that they don't like
what they are being served
with..
It is of some interest to me
that U C C A , the University
Central Council on Admissions,
have introduced a two pound
fee (to cover admin.) to become
effective 77 for entrance 78.
One wonders whether this will
deter any prospective students
from continuing into further
education; probably not, but it
certainly appears to make a
mockery of the concept of free
education. A lot of people have
voiced criticisms against the
notion of p a y m e n t for the
service offered by U C C A , but
few have expressed the same
concern over, or even mentioned,
the practices of the Northern
Universities J M B , who for some
years now have been charging
an 'administrative fee' for
performing a similar operation
amongst its five university
members .
I was, like many, bewildered
and shocked to learn of the
untimely and tragic death of
Ron Kill earlier this month. In
the last four years Ron played
an extremely active part in
Union and Hall life, enjoying
his student days to the full. It
is a shame that there are not
more like him at IC, for it would
be a better place to five and
study. I'm sure that I speak for
all the staff of F E L I X and
students in e x p r e s s i n g my
deepest condolences to Ron's
fiancee and family.
In closing, if you would like
another P G issue of F E L I X ,
all contributions will be accept-
ed. Thanks for this issue are
due to Duncan, Gill, Ian and
Clive.
UCCA FEE
APPROVED
T H E U n i v e r s i t i e s Central
C o u n c i l on A d m i s s i o n s
( U C C A ) has decided to
introduce an 'applicants fee'
to a l l prospective students
who use the U C C A scheme.
The fee will be introduced
next autumn (1977) for students
entering university in 1978
E a c h student w i l l be required
to enclose a Â£2 cheque or
postal order with his or her
application.
The d e c i s i o n to levy the
fee came as a result of a
ballot, organised by U C C A .
E a c h educational organisation
using U C C A was asked to
indicate its view on the
proposed fee. The voting was:
For the fee 55, Against 39,
Abstentions 2, R e p l i e s not
received in time 4. Imperial
C o l l e g e Board of studies had
earlier decided to abstain in
the voting.
