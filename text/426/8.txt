Oarsmen strike
gold at Henley
A year's intensive training by
Boat C l u b members culminated
in one of their most s u c c e s s f u l
performances i n recent years at
the Henley R o y a l Regatta, this
year held on the first four days
of J u l y .
I C fielded two teams - the
first in the L a d i e s P l a t e , a
competition for college crews,
and the second in the Thames
C u p , an open event.
B o t h crews were found accom
modation at Henley i n the days
leading up to the R e g a U a , and
this enabled us to train on the
course. O n the first day, both
crews won comfortably, beating
L i n c o l n C o l l e g e , Oxford, a n d .
Townmead R C respectively. The
l s t VIII again showed their c l a s s
against Queen's C o l l e g e , (C)
taking a lenght's lead i n l e s s
than a minute and rowing home
w e l l i n front. T h i s w i n put them
through to the third day and into
the quarter finals .where they
were narrowly beaten by Queens'
B e l f a s t .
The 2nd VIII were not s o
lucky with their draw on Friday,
being matched against the e v e n -
tual winners of the Thames
C u p , Harvard University .How-
ever, fast conditions and a
good fight back resulted in the
fastest ever time over the course
by an Imperial crew - 6m. 4 4 s .
On Sunday, I C ' s super-
oarsmen Andy Bayles and
'Basher' Burch (rowing for
Thames Tradesmen R C ) won
two of the most prestigious
events of the Regatta - the
Grand C h a l l e n g e Cup (for VIII's)
and the P r i n c e P h i l l i p C u p (for
coxed fours).
STOP PRESS: First eight
stroke, Paul Langguth, won a
gold medal in the National
Championships al Nottingham.
Rowing in a coxed pair with a
Leander Club oarsman he fin-
ished two lengths clear of the
rest of the field; the time was
just two seconds outside that
of the coxless pair winners.

O N T H E weekend of the e n d
of term, the B r i t i s h Orienteering
Relay Championships were
held in N o r t h W a l e s .
Unfortunately, the Imperial
C o l l e g e attempt on the National
title seemed fraught with
bad luck from the statt.
After our minibus booking
was rejected, we were left
with no alternative but to travel
by c a r . One car containing
our ' B ' team arrived on
Saturday at B e t w y s - y - C o e d
safely, but A l a n L e a k e y ' s
car containing the ' A ' team
f a i l e d to get further than
Lower Neasden due to
(they said) brake failure. It
i s more likely that they h a d
found out about the forest in
which the championship was
held. It turned out to be
mostly very thick young
trees, and the tracks were
no more runnable, as they
were full of tussock grass, so
that one fell flat on one's
face every few p a c e s .
Nevertheless, the ' B '
team manfully attempted the
course that the ' A ' team should
have run and Ian Isherwood
s u c c e s s f u l l y completed the
first l e g . Pete Johnson on
the second l e g had more
TWO W E E K S ago four runners
crashed through the fairground
at Horsham on their way to the
changing rooms to prepare for
the imminent start of the
' B l u e Star' 10 mile road race.
Fortunately for them 'Planet
of the A p e s ' ( ? ) delayed the
start by some 15 minutes,
enabling R o b A l l i n s o n to
clear h i s system, or so
he thought....
The course w a s uphill for
the first four m i l e s , then
swiftly down to finish with a
long, boring, undulating
section back into Horsham.
Perhaps it wouldn't have been
so bad if we hadn't passed so
many pubs
Despite these, Steve Webb
scored a rare victory over a n
ailing Rob A l l i s o n , completing
the course in 55.10 mins. T h i s
put him in 27th place.
The sight of a l l those
pubs on the course w a s just
too much for u s e , and so
several establishments had to
be v i s i t e d which rounded off a
pleasant days outing.
Results: Steve'Webb. 55. tmins;
Rob Allinson, 57.0 mins: Paul
Clarke, 61.1 mins: Pete
Johnson, 69.5 mins.
trouble though, and after
finding four controls in
about 90 minutes, he noticed
that he was near the finish
and decided to retire. Mean-
w h i l e , John G i b b i n s had not
waited for P e t e to f i n i s h , but
had already set off on the
third l e g . John d i d slightly
better, but the proximity of
nightfall prevented him from
finding the last few controls.
O n the Sunday, the Combined
Harvesters' Trophy Event
was held where we did rather
better. David Rosen won the
' E l i t e ' course by several
minutes and Ian Isherwood
and Pete Johnson both
completed their courses in
about 120 minutes.
Orienteering does not
take place only in term times,
and P G members are active
throughout the vacations on
most Sundays. If y o u would
like to have a go, keep an
eye on the C l u b noticeboard,
or ring David R o s e n on 4459.
