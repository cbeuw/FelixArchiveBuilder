Theatre Tom Stevenson takes a critical look at three
plays on in the London areas.
Take your choice - you can't lose
T H E T E M P E R A T U R E of the Lyttelton
Theatre is maintained at a cool 20 C ,
as though to raise it by so much as one
tenth of a degree might cause the
delicate production to wilt. T h e play in
question is Noel C o w a r d ' s Blithe
Spirit in a new production by the National
Theatre, thirty five years after its first
London performance.
Noel Coward; there's a name to
conjure with, for Sir Noel w a s a man of
extraordinary theatrical versatility. A s
a playwright h i s Hay Fever, Private
Lives and Blithe Spirit are s t i l l widely
performed; a s a composer h i s songs,
London Pride, Some Day I'll Find You,
Mad Dogs and Englishmen have become
part of the E n g l i s h heritage; as an actor,
who c a n forget h i s appearance in that
memorable film The Italian Job? And
;yet, 1 suppose, you either hate or adore
h i s work, which is undeniably apredilection
of the middle c l a s s e s .
T o make a comedy from a plot i n
which the ghost of a man's first wife
succeeds in k i l l i n g h i s second requires
a great deal of talent. T h e Lyttelton
Audience laps it a l l up with bursts of
spontaneous applause at appropriate
points throughout the action. Perhaps
many of them saw the p l a y ' s first run
during the war i n w h i c h , for a time, the
author played the lead. E v e n so this i s
a production which d e l i c i o u s l y evokes
an age when there w a s no news on the
front page of The Times, when one
dressed for dinner and when there were
domestic staff that were so difficult to
handle.
Maria A i t k e n plays E l v i r a , the first
wife, in a kind of glow which brilliantly
succeeds in reminding us that she i s
i n v i s i b l e to a l l save C h a r l e s and that
he i s the only one who c a n hear her.
Once we have worked through a ridiculous
series of misunderstandings in which
Ruth, the second wife, naturally takes
grave offence at C h a r l e s ' acid reaction
to E l v i r a ' s presence, there is a glorious
moment when E l v i r a reveals herself to
Ruth by carrying a vase of flowers
across the room, and only just avoids
throwing the water into her s u c c e s s o r ' s
face.
The p l a y ' s most clearly drawn character
i s Madame A r c a t i , the medium who
arrives for dinner on her b i c y c l e and
apologises for her lateness "1 had a
premonition of a puncture so I went back
for my p u m p " . But it turns out that she
didn't have a puncture. Maybe time
gilds the memory, but Margaret Rutherford's
performance in the film, with R e x
Harrison, seems a difficult standard set
for the part, which E l i z a b e t h Spriggs
doesn't quite reach. E i l e e n D i s s '
sumptuous set completes a magnificent
production.
If Blithe Spirit evokes a past age of
luxury then Weapons of Happiness brings
us up to date with a vengance. Howard
Brenton's play i s the first new work to
be commissioned by the National
Theatre in the L y t t e l t o n . Brenton i s a
member of a new stream of British play-
wrights committed to writing plays which
reflect real ife as it i s l i v e d by the vast
majority of people.
So, in Weapon's of Happiness we have
a group of young people who occupy their
workplace, a run down potato crisp
factory. A l s o working in the factory i s
Josef Frank, a victim of the C z e c h
treason trials of the early fifties, who
has escaped and come to England full
of anguished memories of h i s life in
the E a s t , which we s e e in a series of
flash-backs — walking the streets of
Moscow and meeting S t a l i n , on a trade
delegation, being instructed in the
" r i g h t " a n s w e r s for his P r a g u e show-trial.
Whilst the young and particularly inept
occupiers carry on their little revolution,
Frank stands by, full of experience and
yet unable to help them, s o strong i s h i s
o b s e s s i o n with the past.
Frank F i n l a y shuffles about the vast
stage as the C z e c h , Frank, c l a d for the
most part, in an enormous overcoat, as
though to protect him from the bitter
wind that still blows from the E a s t .
J u l i e Covington plays J a n i c e , the
nascent Marxist, trying to put the i l l -
formed ideas into practice and leading
an unlikely group of B r i t i s h Youth
containing a nose-picking deaf-mute, a
violent illiterate and a Dylan-freak.
The bare stage i s o c c a s i o n a l l y filled
with Hayden G r i f f i n ' s magnificent
sets, ranging from the London Planeteriiim
complete with heavenly images (and a
smooth talking announcer) to a dockside
with twinkling lights in the back-ground.
One must assume that it is to celebrate
the recent bicentenary of the American
Declaration of Independence that the
R o y a l Shakespeare Company have chosen
to resurrect Shaw's The Devil's Disciple
at the A l d w y c h . However, having said
that, and many thanks to the programme
notes for having pointed this out, the
play i s one of Shaw's Three P l a y s for
Puritans ( the others are Caesar and
Cleopatra and Captain Brasshound's
Conversion). It i s the story of a man so
oppressed by h i s mother's o b s e s s i v e
Puritanism that he rebels and sets
himself up as a friend to the d e v i l ,
though only so far as to respect the
object of h i s mother's hate. What he
actually becomes is a highly moral
up-standing c i t i z e n prepared to die for
any man in town. It i s a splendid play
and receives magnificent treatment in
this production.
Tom C o n t i , as the d i s c i p l e , leads a
strong cast. H i s evident joie de vivre in
the face of his miserable mother, severely
played by P a t i e n c e C o l l i e r , livens up an
otherwise mournful gathering for the
reading of h i s father's w i l l . John Wood,
veteran of Tom Stoppard's Travesties, in
which he played the lead both as an
old and a young man, switching with
remarkable rapidity between them, sticks
to General Burgoyne, the English
Commander-in-Chief, known to his
subordinates as Gentlemanly Johnny;
from h i s first appearance, when he lays
himself down on the courtroom table to
catch up on h i s sleep, we know every
gram of comedy is going to be extracted
from the part; and it is too.
The audience, packed with Americans,
particularly enjoyed the scathing
references to E n g l i s h colonialism - what
excuse can we have for a production of
" T h e Apple C a r t " , in which the American
Ambassador in London requests re-
admission into the B r i t i s h Empire?

DUPLICATING
TWO NEWGestetner duplicators
have arrived at the Union to
replace the non-active Roneo
machines. In the interests of
all who might want to use them
in the future, no-one should
attempt to use them until he or
she has received expert tuition
in how to handle them from
Chalky White (to be found in
the IC Union Office).
