Coffee and World
development
A N O X F O R D cooperative called
Uhuru has started to market a
high grade instant coffee
from E a s t A f r i c a as part of a
drive to expose the s o c i a l
conditions in which many of the
goods we buy are produced.
T r a c e your next cup of
tea back to Sri L a n k a and
you w i l l find c h r o n i c
malnutrition in the families
which p i c k e d it for you.
Trace your coffee back to
B r a z i l and you will see the
fruits of v i c i o u s exploitation
of the poor. Your oranges may
lead you to South A f r i c a , your
grapes to the misery of the
migrant workers in southern
C a l i f o r n i a . T h e list goes on â€”
what Uhuru describe as " a
basket-full or rotten s h o p p i n g " .
Uhuru's coffee leads back
to T a n z a n i a , one of the few
countries in the world attacking
poverty by making the poor

T H E R E IS nothing - absolutely
nothing - half so much worth
doing as simply messing about
in boats, as T o a d always
said. So, take 100 IC
Postgraduates, a suitable
craft, some booze, some food,
some good music and a
moonlit stretch of the Thames
and, if arranged in the right
order you should finish up
with something really worth
doing.
On Thursday the 8th of
July I found myself standing
on Tower P i e r with a l l the
above ingrediants. Well the
music was a little late arriving,
but then the R C S J 4 is not
noted for breaking world
landspeed records, and neither
is Dave Dodge (Oh no? - Ed)
The boat drew away from the
pier just after 7 pm and P G G
Riverboat Party was afloat.
A l l was quiet for the first
few seconds as we slipped
off down the Thames in the
general direction of the s e a
and then some fool discovered
that the bar was open. A n
orderly queue fonned and
several participants were
trampled under foot. The main
problem was that the bar was
b a s i c a l l y 1
a water-tight
compartment (what-a-tight
compartment), which rapidly
filled up with the people-with-

more powerful, rather than
waiting for benefits to
trickle down as the r i c h get
richer. Unfortunately they
s t t l l need foreign exchange
for e s s e n t i a l imports, and
s e l l i n g coffee i s one way of
getting it. That w i l l not be
e a s y , for gluts of coffee have
been common on the world
market, and concerned people
are worried about the use of
land for cash-crops rather
than for food for l o c a l
consumption. Such problems
or d e c i s i o n s on development
strategies are never simple,
and Uhuru are careful to
maintain that " O u r aim i s
neither primarily to s e l l good
tasting coffee, nor to increase
coffee drinking or the coffee
trade. We are aiming to r a i s e
questions in p e o p l e ' s minds
about just one of the things
we eat or drink every d a y . "
Hence the name " C a m p a i g n
C o f f e e " . It c o s t s 66p for a
4oz packet, which is more
expensive than the big names
but the people who produce it
don't starve. A n d it does
taste good.
P a c k e t s can be ordered
from John Shade, Room 45,

come round and try some if
you can catch me i n .

PG Problems
D U R I N G the time a research
or M S c student i s at I C it i s a
fair bet that he or she w i l l
not be short of worries of one
kind or another. Furthermore
the difficulties of l i v i n g in
L o n d o n on an inadequate
income combined with the
ambiquities of much P G
activity tend to cause these
problems to interact.
O c c a s i o n a l l y a P G feels
in need of C o l l e g e - b a s e d
advice but does not w i s h to
approach either course co-
ordinator/supervisor or Nightliie
Student Welfare. The head
of your department/section
maybe an a c c e s s i b l e and
sympathetic guru. However, an
alternative source of wisdom
on difficulties with major or
minor " c o l l e g e " aspects of
life i s to be found in most
departments.
At least two C o l l e g e
committees have recommended
that each department should
arrange that a member of
staff be available for consult-
ation by P G s . Most departments
have accepted the value of
the " s a f e t y - n e t " and have
been able to appoint a
suitable person. Since they
have not all p u b l i c i s e d this,
a list of the staff involved i s
given below (ST indicates
that the person is the depart-
ment's Senor Tutor).

No! No! Don't read this-you're
much too apathetic!
I WAS about to write an
article about apathy amongst
postgraduates when someone
pointed out to me that the IC
Cricket Team is composed
almost entirely of P G ' s . Then
it occurred to me that really, it
is very difficult to define the
state of apathy in the U n i o n .
My original article was
going to be adamning indictment
of the 1400 - odd P G ' s who
did not appear at the I C P G
Group Annual General Meeting
last month. But was their non-
appearance really a statement
of contentment with their lot
at IC? Maybe they feel that
they don't need the Union to
press, on their behalf, for
more common rooms or higher
demonstrating rates. One thing
I am sure of is that we do not
need the I C P G G to deal with
supervisor - student problems;
these are highly personal
relationships, and any attempt
by the Union to legislate or
set standards would be wrong.
So who are these apathetic
P G ' s ? Not those who join in
and utilise the various sports
f a c i l i t i e s offered by the U n i o n .
Not all those overseas students
who take part in events
organised by their national
s o c i e t i e s . Not those who
write for FELIX or Phoenix
or appear on S T O I C or are
heard on IC Radio. Not those
who belong to other Union
club s o c i e t i e s . F o r the c l u b s
and societies are the roots of
the U n i o n . Many more students
take part inthose a c t i v i t i e s than
attend Union meetings or stand
for election to the multitude of
committees which run the U n i o n .
The real apathetic are the
people who won't read this
article, those who take no
interest in the Union, except
(perhaps) for the o c c a s i o n a l
meal or drink. But they are
just as much members as
those of us who take an
active part in U n i o n affairs.
Perhaps they think that the
Union is an undergraduate-
orientated body (it i s , of
course, but then whose fault
is that?) and that the c h i l d i s h
pranks of the U G ' s do not
create the right atmosphere
for those already armed with
a BSc or whatever. I must
confess that I sometimes
swear never to darken the
Union building's doors again,
when the entrance hall bears
the evidence of a particularly
heavy night's drinking,- albeit
on the part of a very small
minortiy of members.
So, is there a solution to
this " w a v e of a p a t h y " ? Or
should we be content to allow
students to lead their own
lives and not coerce them into
activity in a body in which they
appear to have no interest?
