G R A C E WITH T H E S E A (Certificate

105 mins. Opens shortly at the
Carlton, Hay market.
T h i s film, in the opinion of both
F e l i x staff who went to s e e it, has far
mure potential than both the marketers
and Screen International are w i l l i n g to
give it. T h e posters make it out to be
no less 'action packed' than 'Sex the
Scandinavian W a y ' , whilst the blurt
put out in the critical reviews reckons
that it rates 9.5 foi gore.
Despite the rather macabre plot the
film is neither gory nor does it descend
to the level of a B-rate sex movie. In
fact it has an enthralling and captivating
a story as 'One F l e w Over The plot
hanqs arnunrl thp adnlpscent problems
between Jonathan (Jonathan Kahn) and
Ins widowed mother ySaian Mnesj. The
latter falls in love, and decides to marry,
the second lieutenant of the Boston
B e l l e , a tramp steamer that arrives at
their picturesque Devon harbour.
Meanwhile Jonathan has discovered a
peephole from his bedroom to his mother's.
It is through this peephole that we s e e
the carnal side of the love affair develop.
The factor, though, that sets this
film apart from the rest is the secret
society to which Jonathan belongs. T h e
leader of the pack, to coin a well worn,
but in this case quite befitting, expression
is simply c a l l e d ' T h e C h i e f (Earl
Rhodes). H e is a child beyond h i s
years, aware of the contradictions of
adult society upon which he c a s t s h i s
own contemptuous interpretation.
The rest of the cabal view him in
awe, ruthlessly kept in line by the
Chief. He scorns their teenage infatuation
with soft-porn magazines, focusing
instead on the 'pure and perfect order
of life' and how it has been defiled by
adults. Morality, he maintains, i s an
invention of adults.
He encourages h i s crew to 'dismantle
the r u l e s ' , resist adult tyranny and seek
'the inner being' in a l l things. To
demonstrate this last point, the cigar-
smoking chief, whose father is a doctor,
at one point d i s s e c t s a c a t in front of
them.
To our relief the d i s s e c t i o n i s not
shown in graphic detail, the scene
remaining tasteful and artistic throughout.
When Jonathan's mother f a l l s for the
handsome, nigged, quiet-spoken J i m
Cameron (Kris Kristofferson), he
(Jonathan) at first hero worships h i m .
Then, a s the jibes of the Chief become
more frequent, a s do the v i s i t s by the
sailor, h i s opinions are turned against
J i m , who has upset the perfect order...
The punishment meeted out for this,
and other crimes, is the same a s that
for C e d r i c , the C h i e f ' s cat: d i i s e c t i o n
after being drugged.
Whilst the film is horrific by implication,
all scenes have been carefully and
thoughtfully constructed, and no-one
should leave the cinema feeling queasy —
an d if it wasn't for the 10 minutes or s o
of 'stuff through the peephole' it i s
doubtful whether it would carry an X
label.
The film is engaging from the start
and well worth seeing; director L e w i s
John Carlino has handled the story w e l l ,
retaining much sensitivity and plausibility.
Particularly creditworthy is h i s direction
of the teenage actors Jonathan Kahn and
Earl Rhodes. K r i s Kristofferson a l s o
produces his best performance to date.
Duncan Suss C l i v e Dewey
Milligan's Midsummer
Madness
S P I K E M I L L I G A N - famous goon,
humourist and cult hero; slightly less
famous as trumpet player and defeater of
the Third R e i c h ; virtually unknown as
flower arranger and insect taxidermist —
is back in town. H i s (initially) shon run
of late shows at the Mermaid has now been
extended to July 31st.
A s we entered the theatre a distant
voice over the P A said " C a n we start,
n o w " , and lit the blue touch paper to a n
hour of hilarity and m u s i c . A l l the o l d
goon lines were there:-"
'"ello, 'ello, 'ello. What's going' on 'ere
then?" "It's a show, officer, hut I can't
get it started." Spike makes noises of
engine (trying to start but failing
miserably) "Do you 'ave a licence for
this show?" Spike produces licence and
shows it to himself. "But that's a dog
licence. " "Woof!"
The music which w a s delightfully
woven in amongst this madness w a s
excellent, and included several of
Spike's more off-beat renditions, such
as 'The flight of the bumble-bee while
cleaning one's teeth", and accompanying
the piano by playing the c l a s s i f i e d adds,
from the Evening Standard. T h e whole
show had that thoroughly ad-libbed look;
the audience themselves provided
frequent distractions, as their comings
and goings were highlighted by Mr
M i l l i g a n ' s torch and suitable comments.
Frequent attacks on the 'Frustration
Dummy' (a very battered taylor's dummy
which they 'knocked the shit out of if the
show wasn't going too well) and a song
on the theme 'Only a nose' during which
Spike changed to steadily larger and
more rediculous theatrical noses, added
general state of insanity.
One thing which became apparent w a s
the master's inability to relax in the
shadows during the m u s i c a l interludes;
even with the sport on the singer and
darkness on the rest of the stage. M i l l i g a n
dominated the scene. H i s frequent inter-
uptions during the songs had not only the
audience, but a l s o the singers, falling
about.
One joke, which particularly s t i c k s
in the mind, concerns an Irish surgeon
who performed the first s u c c e s s f u l
haemorrhoids transplant.
Spike's musical friends fitted the
mood of the show, and their apparently
sincere and uncontrollable laughter,
despite having gone through the show
many times, added to the impression that
Spike had never bothered to read or even
write, the script.
One left the theatre feeling happier,
and madder, and more able to face the
crazy world outside and still come up
laughing.
Voulez-vous
promenade
avec moi ?
WHAT C O U L D be more pleasant than
sitting at home, on a warm summer's
day, listening to your favourite music?
How about standing in the Albert Hall,
on a warm summer's day, listening to your
favourite music? A s I am sure noone at
IC can have failed to notice, 'The Proms'
are with us again, and the many friendly
(if eccentric) disciples of Henry Wood.
The first night (Friday 16th July)
lit the stage for what promises to be
an excellent season; Beethoven's
"Missa Solemnis", and Kempe w a s to
have conducted, but h i s untimely and
unfortunate demise brought back C o l i n
D a v i s to the Proms Scene. A minute's
silence w a s observed in memory and
respect of Kempe at the beginning of
the concert. Mr D a v i s ' s interpretation of
the mass was characteristically exuberant;
and in parts, the military pomp of the
brass section afforded clear contrast to
the angelic themes of the 'world to come'.
The quartet added variety a n d spice
with its free-flowing and uninhibited
style (in contrast to that of the Missa
Solemnis) T h e group w a s lead by
Ursula Koszut; Anna Reynolds; John
Shirley—Quirk and Anthony Rolfe
Johnsonma.de up the foursome.
At the end of this short, exciting
concert, the promenaders were riding
high on a wave of enthusiasm which w i l l ,
hopefully, carry through to the e n d of
the season. A s always, variety i s foremost,
and whatever your m u s i c a l taste, there
w i l l be some (at least) of your favourites,
plus a chance to hear many l e s s played
and new p i e c e s . There i s a night of just
Benjamin Britten's m u s i c , and fans of
Brackner are given a rare treat later in
the season.
"The Proms are c l o s e and cheap;
everyone should take advantage of
these two points; and of the chance to
listen to some great m u s i c . Forthcoming
concerts of particular interest and merit
include Verdi's " Falstaff", Bach's
"St Matthew Passion", and a particular
favourite of mine, Tchaikovsky's 6th
Symphony, "The Pathetique".
In short, with the possible exception
of some Gary Glitter fans, there is
something for everyone at this year's
Promenade Concerts; do try to go.
