PG issues must not be ignored
in national campaigns
T H I S W A S the feeling o f the N U S
Postgraduates conference held at
Imperial C o l l e g e o n the 2nd and 3rd of
this month. F o r far too long i s s u e s such
as P G grants have been left to go by
default once the Undergraduate grant
l e v e l has been s e t . It w i l l be particularly
important this coming year a s it i s the
year o f the D E S ' s trienniel review of
funding for education. T h e usual excuses
of wanting to do something, but having
to work on a strictly limited budget w i l l
not apply s o strongly this year as the
D E S w i l l have a chance to seek n e w
funds and reconsider the allocations to
various sectors of education.
In a time o f heavy public spending
cuts it w a s v i t a l that P G s d i d not suffer
because there i s no voice i n their defence.
The conference recognised that the
campaigning t a c t i c s employed for U G
i s s u e s might not attract much support
among P G s s o the Postgraduate A d v i s o r y
Group w i l l consider ways of building
an effective campaign, probably involving
the encouragement of P G s to write to their
M P s and" seeking representation for the
Advisory Group to such bodies a s the
D E S and the Government.
PGs and Trade Unions
The Conference opened with Sue
Slipman ( N U S National Secretary, with
responsibility for P G s ) i n the chair and
far fewer P G s than expected. There were
only around thirty delegates representing
a s t i l l smaller number o f c o l l e g e s and
U n i v e r s i t i e s . Initial d i s c u s s i o n s were
centred o n the present state o f affairs
between P G s and the two trade unions
with an interest i n P G s , that i s , the
A U T ( A s s o c i a t i o n of University Teachers
and A S T M S ( A s s o c i a t i o n o f Scientific
T e c h n i c a l and Managerial Staffs).
T h e recent d e c i s i o n o f the A U T to
j o i n the T U C may change their attitude
towards P G s . T h e usual s u s p i c i o n
of trade unions w a s present and many
people d i d not feel that there w a s
anything to be gained from membership
of either union. T h i s w i l l almost certainly
be true unless the A U T are prepared to
offer a new deal to P G s i n the foim o f a
better c l a s s of membership and a
reasonable l e v e l o f representation for
P G s both within and by the a s s o c i a t i o n .
The majority of the conference w a s
taken up by d i s c u s s i o n s of the report
on the future o f P G education presented
by the P G Group. T h e document w a s an
attempt by the group to respond to the
reports o n Postgraduate T r a i n i n g /
E d u c a t i o n which have been receiving a
lot of attention over the past year. In
preparing the report the Group found that
merely replying to the recomendations of
the other reports would lead to them
advocating the status q u o . T o overcome
this, they decided to start from scratch
and l a y down what they felt were the
essence, requirements and constraints of
a l l forms o f Postgraduate education.
Cheap research labour
The d i s c u s s i o n considered a great
variety of i s s u e s under the headings o n
the d i s c u s s i o n paper and a great many
useful additions to the report were made
from the floor. One area o f particular
concern w a s the justification of research
both a s something useful and necessary
to society and the educational system,
and a s a more valuable a n d broader
education to the individuals concerned
than i s often supposed. T h e need to
prevent too much stress being put o n the
immediate industrial usefulness a n d
saleability o f the product of a P h D
project were upheld by the students
present. Such stress c a n often causae
the educational aspects to be overlooked.
The CASE scheme of co-operative
studies with industries w a s c i r t i c i s e d
as being open to abuse and allowing
some students to be u s e d , a s cheap
research labour for industry.
Funding a l s o came under the critical
eye of the conference and recommendations
included the setting up of a n arts
research c o u n c i l similar to the Science
R e s e a r c h C o u n c i l , to correct many of the
anomalies produced by the present
haphazard systems of funding for
research into arts subjects. Changes in
the present system of awards were also
c a l l e d for, both i n the rigid three year
award made at present irrespective of the
duration of the course and i n the relaxa-
tion of the first degree grade stipulations.
On the subject of supervision,
delegates felt that the system needed to
be investigated e s p e c i a l l y i n that the
present single supervisor set-up can
cause several problems. In the even of
the supervisor leaving or even dying
during the duration of a student's work
many problems and even long delays are
often experienced. A l s o , i n the event of
personality c l a s h e s between student and
supervisor or disagreement over the
direction of the research, the student
often finds himself with no one else to
turn to for help or advice. Students
from polytechnics present, where it i s
common to have an academic and an
industrial supervisor, said that this
overcame many o f the above problems. The
idea of having more than one supervisor
was w e l l received by the conference.
The report w i l l now be redrafted by
the A d v i s o r y Group and should be ready
for circulation i n the autumn.
More effort on PG affairs
Chairing the meeting o n the second
day was Steve Moon the N U S Executive
Officer who takes over from M s Slipman
the responsibility for P G affairs. He
does not have a sabatical position but
hopes he w i l l be able to devote a lot
of time and effort to P G s since h i s
other responsibilities o n the Executive
are not too time consuming. He intends to
start by trying to get more money from
N U S to support the P G Advisory Group
in order that it c a n be more active and
also get more information back to P G
groups and s o c i e t i e s i n colleges. He
feels sure that something c a n be done to
overcome the perennial problems of
organising and communicating with P G s ,
but with only thirty at the conference, it
is not a very inspiring start.

External Eclairs:
the end of an era
T H E E N D o f s e s s i o n i s with
us once more; Union Officers
are crashing about our ears,
cut down i n their primes (which
primes — Ed), and I am putting
pen to paper. (Not quill to
read despite the cuts eh — Ed
again) for the last time i n this
hat (I wonder if I could have
an office next year?)
The time h a s come to look
over our shoulders for the
last time, like Orpheus, before
leaving the Underworld for the
fresh light of a new year.
(Gosh what posh prose). What
have we achieved? Over what
terrain have we travelled?
B e h i n d us are more battles
lost than w o n and the path
has been littered with corpses,
motions that never p a s s e d
through N U S Conference a n d
those that never even reached
Conference... L i k e Goering, I
have l i v e d in trains travelling
between Birmingham a n d
London and risked my life i n
minibuses driven by R i c k
"I c a n carve up more jugger-
nauts than y o u c a n " P a r k e r
and Peter Teague (not quite
simultaneously). I have
chanted " B a y C i t y R o l l e r s "
with N i c k B r a y s h a w and Ian
M i n n i s at Communist Party
Benefit D i s c o s and stayed
awake during more committee
meetings than I c a n count
from memory.
I have not had my private
parts bitten by J u l i a R o s s (So
unlucky — Ed, painfully), but
I have spent a fair amount o f
time at U S K (defunct) c o l l e g e s
such a s I F ( L 1 n s t i t u t F r a n c a i s ) .
I have sat on the steps of the
Department of Education and
Science from midnight t i l l
four i n the morning a n d l i v e d
to t e l l the tale - i n F E L I X .
Who knows what the next
twelve months may bring?
