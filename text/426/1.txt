T H E S U M M E R Accommodation
Centre has got off to a good
start this year with only two
minor disputes between the
student staff and the C o l l e g e
rippling the surface of the
hotel scheme.
Under the watchful e y e of
Mrs Audrey P o d h a j s k y , the
Bookings Manageress, and
Capt L i n d l e y , the Domestic
Secretary, S A C has undergone
a major overhaul and is now
being run on new lines in
order to make the scheme
f i n a n c i a l l y watertight. Nothing
wrong with that since the
profits from the lettings go
towards s u b s i d i s i n g students'
term-time hall rents, but the
charging of £1 to visitors for
a Mooney breakfast has
raised an eyebrow or three.
However, it was the
extent of the S A C overhaul
which l e d to a certain amount
of confusion. In previous
years, the wage advertised

Southside cleared
A M O T O R driving one of the
lifts in Southside developed a
fault on Thursday 15 J u l y
leading to the whole building
being evacuated and three
fire engines arriving to deal
with the trouble.
The fault i n themotor c a u s e d
a strong smell of burning
rubber to pervade certain
sections of Falmouth and
T i z a r d H a l l s . T h e fire alarms
soon went off at 11.35 am a n d
the message buzzed through the
halls, from landing to landing
and staircase to staircase by
the cleaners who were working
at the timej it w a s not a
practice d r i l l .
T e n minutes later the
building was cleared and three
fire engines arrived on the
north side of Princes Gardens
only to be re-directed to the
south side where they drew up
five minutes later. B y now the
crowd which had gathered
outside Southside were getting
anxious.
The cause of the fire w a s
soon discovered at the bottom
of one o f the lift shafts and
maintenance engineers were
called in to deal with the
problem. B y 12.05 pm the
commotion w a s over and the
H a l l inmates were able to
re-enter the building.
was always the " t a k e - h o m e "
wage for the student staff.
T h i s year, however many
were shocked on the first
pay-day to discover that this
was not going to be the case:
the wage advertised w a s
£15.84 and 91p w a s going to
be docked from that as an
insurance contribution. T h e
take-home wage w a s therefore
going to be £14.93 which is
7p l e s s than last year! After
quick consultations, the
C o l l e g e agreed that the take-
home wage for the cleaners'
would be £16.01 and the c l e r k s '
wages would be increased
proportionately.
The next source of worry
for the student cleaners w a s
that question of unused meal-
tickets which visitors had
paid for but sometimes d i d not
wish to u s e . T h e s e have
occasionally been left as tips
for the cleaners and in the
past, under the direction of
the scheme manageress,
cleaners were allowed to use
the tickets themselves. T h i s
practice has now been stopped.
When a complaint was made
about this previously accepted
incentive being eliminated,
Capt Lindley insisted that
each and every cleaner had
been told before starting work
for S A C that no such tickets
could be used by students
under any circumstances.
Several of the cleaners however
are equally insistant that they
had been told no such thing.
.Despite the fact that the
number of meal-tickets which
could be used by cleaners
would represent a drop i n the
financial ocean, Capt L i n d l e y
could not be .persuaded to
change his mind.
C l e a r l y then, the new
policy for the running of S A C
did not filter through completely
to a l l the student staff.
