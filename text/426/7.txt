River
drinks, who were unable to get
out because of the people-
without-drinks trying to get i n .
The situation soon resolved
itself and the L a w of
Differential Drinking Speeds
minimised the problems i n the
bar for the rest of the evening.
A s the N a v a l C o l l e g e at
Greenwich floated by to our
starboard side people were
chatting amicably, drinking
loudly and beginning to tuck
into the light buffet provided
A s the N a v a l C o l l e g e p a s s e d
by again on our port side,
(I presume that we turned
around some time between
the two o c c a s i o n s ) the music
began to increase in volume
and people began to girate to
the primitive rythms.
The boat continued with its
pointed end firmly fixed on the
new National Theatre and as
the evening c l o s e d i n , w e
began to realise many of the
advantages of taking a boat o n
the river. T h e most obvious of
these w a s the fact that it w a s
probably the coolest place i n
London at that time. With the
rest o f the C i t y glowing orange
after a day in the nineties, the
Thames boasted a c o o l breeze
which made even dancing
bearable. T h e party w a s w e l l
underway with most of the
guests bopping to the exquisite
Mines D i s c o , or e l s e sitting
out and watching the spotlit
sights o f the city slip silently
by. T h e Mines D i s c o , kept up
an impressive and popular
flow of music throughout the
evening - they not only bring
music and lights, "but enough
D J s and assistants to f i l l any
party even i f the guests don't
turn u p .
A s the Tower of London
passed dangerously c l o s e to
our port side, and a very
carelessly driven pier c o l l i d e d
with the same side, the
occupants of this refugee
from Dunkirk were disgorged
onto dry land. Everyone seemed
to have enjoyed the jaunt as
they walked off towards the
tube, exchanging P o l a r o i d
pictures of each others'
misdemeanors and showing off
the scars from the opening
of the bar.
(PS A n y falacious rumours
about my enjoying the evening
so much that I decided to have
a minute nap i n the flower beds
on Fulham Broadway station
are put about by liars and
disgruntled L o n d o n Transport
gardeners.)
