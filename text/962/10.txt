Excellence thru enjoyment
Keith McNully Bass voice representative at IC Choir examines the
130th performance of that august body.
In the Great Hall on 19th March,
Imperial College Choir will
perform its 130th concert. Ever
since its foundation in January 1950
the tradition of giving a
performance every term has been
unbroken. The present conductor,
Eric Brown, has conducted 115 of
these concerts and is now in his 40th
year as conductor of IC Choir.
Numerous times has Queen
Alexandra's House, the R C M and,
after 1969, the Great Hall been
filled to hear yet another rendition
from a choir whose reputation has
grown tremendously since its
formation.
Among the choir's many
performances has been the London
Premiere of Benjamin Britten's
Hymn to St Peter, in 1955, under
Imogen Hoist, and the World
Premiere of Christopher Shaw's No
Room at the Inn. Also memorable
for a different reason is the choir's
performance of Britten's
unaccompanied Hymn to St Cecilia,
in which under-ventilation and
fatigue resulted in the choir
dropping pitch by a full tone and a
half. The situation was saved by a
soloist who, in sheer panic, sang a
solo that was completely different
from what was written in the score,
but somehow managed to restore
the pitch, thus saving the piece from
total collapse.
Today, IC Choir is just as strong,
if not stronger than ever. How has
the choir managed to survive the
environment of a purely scientific
college? Firstly, and perhaps most
importantly, the choir considers
talent secondary to dedication.
Dedication is something you need
to be a member. Talent is developed
while you are a member. For this
reason, the choir does not audition.
It simply requires that you attend a
minimum number of rehearsals in
order to sing in the concert.
Furthermore, members of the
choir find a good balance in their
activities. For every hour of
rehearsal there is an hour of fun.
This is particularly evident in the
choir's weekends away. The first of
the year comes in mid-February to
Bedgebury, an all-girls hording
school in Kent. Here, an intensive
rehearsal schedule is well
complemented with opportunities to
enjoy the surrounding countryside,
a quiz and games night on Saturday,
followed by the highlight of the
weekend—the infamous Bedgebury
Bonfire.
The second weekend away comes
on the last weekend of the Easter
vacation, to Pigotts, a farm/music
camp in Buckinghamshire. Pigotts
has been an annual date on the
choir's calendar for almost 30
years, and its reputation has made
members all too pleased to give up
the last weekend of their holiday.
As well as fitting nine rehearsals
into three days, there is plenty of
time to enjoy the spring sunshine
(providing it doesn't snow like it did
in 1981). The team of cooks
produce food to suit all tastes, while
IC Choir in 1954
the Pigott's Barn Dance is possibly
the most popular social event of the
year.
All this madness, however, must
have an organising force behind it,
and that is the job of the Choir
Committee. Annual committees
have unfailingly managed to make
the choir's year run smoothly. They
have had to deal with numerous
crises over the years. For example,
just before the 100th concert in
March 1983, the Mezzo-Soprano
soloist, Mary Lloyd Davies, was
taken i l l . At the last minute, a
replacement was drafted in in the
form of Miss Anne Mason, and the
concert became yet another success
for IC Choir.
Ultimately, though, it is in the
terrnly concerts that the choir shows
the true dedication and talent of its
members. Next week's concert
should be no exception. Mozart's
Solemn Vespers, Mendelssohn's
Lobgesang Choral Symphony and
the strange but rhythmically
exciting Brazilian Psalm by Jean
Berger should provide yet another
enjoyable evening courtesy of IC
Choir.
Then back to business, when
preparation starts at Pigotts for the
131st termly concert. Perhaps this
is the secret of IC Choir's success,
its unhalting continuity in moving
from one concert to the next. There
is no time to relax, it's heads down
straight away in preparation for the
next performance. In this way the
choir gathers momentum through
experience and is constantly
approaching the excellence it strives
for.
IC Choir's Easter concert takes
place in the Great Hall on Friday,
19th March at 8pm. Tickets can be
purchased from Choir members or
the Central Library, price £2 for
students and £5 for non-students.
Student price is £3 on the door.
The Choir also welcomes new
members. They rehearse on
Thursday evenings at 6.15pm in
Mech Eng 342. If you are interested
in singing in the Summer Concert
you must attend the rehearsal on
Thursday 25th March in order to
find out how to get to Pigotts.
Ladies from other University of
London colleges are welcome to
join.
