St Mary's Vote
Dear Jonty,
How terribly sad it is that once
again the record needs to be set
straight between St Mary's and IC
Union, however the front page
article in Felix 960 leaves us little
alternative.
In the four years that we have
been involved in the Union
activities—including design and
implementation of the Union
merger—we have noticed a
lessening of the anti-IC feeling in
Paddington, but a corresponding
strengthening of the anit-Mary's
lobby in South Kensington. We are,
on the whole, satisfied with the
manner in which IC Union officers
have treated and assisted the Mary's
Union, whenever it was able to do
so. Much of this has been made
possible by the good working
relationships between the last three
presidents of IC and St Mary's
Unions. Paul Shanley, Zoe
Hellinger and Chris Davidson were
all well supported by St Mary's
students in their respective
elections; this illustrates two points.
Firstly, that these three could win
the confidence and support of St
Mary's students was a comment on
their personalities, their
capabilities, their performance in
difficult situations, and yes, their
charisma; the very qualities which
Felix 962
also made them successful
presidents. Secondly, they chose to
get to know students at St Mary's
and understand their concerns-
most notably Wilson House and
Teddington—and consequently
were then able to offer useful back-
up to the St Mary's Union. This we
believe they all did admirably.
Allow us then to stress four
serious concerns arising from the
article in question.
1. ICU knows that the St Mary's
Rag Week is planned to coincide
each year with the United Hospitals
Rugby Cup Final—the dates of
which are set years in advance.
Why then does ICU not choose to
try and avoid holding its hustings
during this period of high spirits and
mischievous merriment, when it
could so easily do so?
2. What sort of democratic
system allows its leaders to be
elected with 'an easy ride' as
Dominic Wilkinson believes
'hustings should be run"}
3. Past experience has shown that
the knowledge and understanding of
the concerns of Medical Students
that ICU candidates have at first is
understandably negligible. Also
negligible is the relevance to
medical students of much of what
the candidates have to say relating
to issues at South Kensington, since
the Mary's Union generally runs its
own financial, social and
representative affairs within the
Medical School. Therefore, what
we look for in the candidates is the
ability to cope in difficult situations,
willingness to listen, learn and
understand, capacity to talk one self
out of almost anything, and most
importantly to ensure they do not
have a serious lack of the qualities
necessary for leadership i.e.
charisma and sense of
humour...which leads nicely on to
Dominic Wilkinson!
4. M r Wilkinson and his belief
that 'Mary's students weren 't fit to
lick the shit off our shoes' really
goes beyond the bounds of common
decency. Rarely have we known a
Union officer anywhere in London
who has had such a blatent and
absolute disdain for his electors—
and with ignorant Union officers
hardly being thin on the ground in
London colleges, you, M r
Wilkinson, have managed to beat
off tough competition!
It is, therefore, obvious to us that
Mr Wilkinson neither desires to nor
is capable of representing over 650
members of his electorate. This
leaves us two alternatives. Firstly,
the I C U Exec must all publicly
dissociate themselves from M r
Wilkinson's comments, leaving M r
Wilkinson no alternative but to
resign. With his past record of
storming out of meetings in a sulk
Mediterranean
Dear Jonty,
We, the members of the Turkish
Society, felt that we have to write
to you regarding the articles
'Greece' and 'Cyprus' in the Felix
International Night Special issue.
If we had told the international
community at Imperial College that
there are some Greek fanatics who
dream to annex Cyrpus, where both
Turkish and Greek communities
live, very few people would have
believed us. If we had told
international community that they
claim territory from Turkey as well,
not many people would have
believed us either. However, if you
read the article 'Greece' in Felix
International Night Special Issue
written by the Hellenic Society, you
will see that they themselves openly
say so. I'd like to take this
opportunity to thank them for
showing their true faces. The fact
is that they don't just dream, they
try to do it in real life. For example,
they came to invade Turkey in the
1920's and caused loss of hundreds
of thousands of human lives
including their own. They also tried
to annex Cyprus in 1974 and started
Conflict
to massacre Turkish communities;
and as a result Turkey had no choice
but to intervene according to the
article IV of the 1960 Treaty of
Guarantee (They claim it was
occupation!).
We sincerely believe that those
fanatics do not represent real Greek
people and we want to stress that we
want to live in peace with our Greek
neighbours as well as with all other
nations. We also urge those fanatics
to wake up and see the realities, the
sooner the better.
Yours faithfully,
Ersin Akartuna on behalf of the
Turkish Society.
Dep Reps
Dear Jonty,
Just a quick note about last
week's Felix.
Firstly, can I point out that being
a Dep Rep may, admittedly, not be
a major responsibility in terms of
the overall organisation of the
universe; but within IC the Dep
Reps are most decidedly the unsung
heros of my department, being
responsible for all things from
keeping the chocolate machine
stocked with Twixes, to calling staff
student committees at a time
convenient to everybody involved.
I'd like to thank Alison, Andy,
Duncan, Matt and Rhian—you've
kept me sane and always been there
when I've need to rely, and depend,
upon you, and only you.
Secondly, 'Rachel 'fred' Bassett.
Does M r Doddery (sic) realise how
petty, maddening, irritating,
annoying, boring, old, sad, sick,
poinfless, useless waste-of-space etc
and infantile it is to repeat a very,
very old joke thinking you're the
only person intelligent enough to
think of it (every time guaranteed).
You can't blame the parents for a
name they give, or indeed are
given, in all innocence, but you can
blame the insensitive brutes who
think anybody will smile; and I for
one intend to until the end of my
days if needs-be.
Lots of love,
Sarah Lee, RCSU AAO.
Any comment about worth
waiting for and I might turn green
and either explode messily all over
you or bite your head off. Slowly.
I haven't decided yet.
if he does not get his own way, he
is presumably not averse to walking
out on his responsibilities, so this
should not present a problem.
Alternatively, the Mary's Union
should demand its own
representation at all levels—
including Governing B o d y -
effectively declaring UDI from IC
Union, something it is perfectly
capable of doing. The second
alternative however, would simply
destroy five years of diplomatic
hard graft, which, until M r
Wilkinson's injudicious,
patronising and offensive
comments, has been successfully
achieving a good working
partnership between our two student
bodies.
We sincerely hope that Chris
Davidson and his Exec do not allow
this sad situation to do lasting
damage to Mary's—IC relations,
and that the successful candidates in
today's elections do not perpetuate
Mr Wilkinson's totally unsuitable
attitude.
Yours sincerely,
Simon P Stockill, Ex President
SMHMS SU (91/92)
Simon G T Smith, Ex President
SMHMS SU (90/91)
Easter
Dear Jonty,
Without wanting to make a big
deal out of it, I would like to point
out that the 'Easter decorations'
cartoon in last week's Felix (5th
March) was offensive. You surely
must have known this before putting
it in. Not only does it offend
Christians but also the other
religions who have Jesus as a
prophet.
Easter means many things to me.
Jesus endured a very painful death
on a cross in order that He may take
away everything that everyone has
done wrong. For three days he
fought with death, which is worse
than anyone can imagine. He came
back to life on the third day,
showing that he had won over all
sin. It is through these three days
that Christians believe we can have
eternal life.
Christians often wear crosses,
which remind us that Jesus went
through all that for everyone, but
often those crosses are empty-
Jesus is no longer on the cross, He
is alive!
To ridicule a painful death as this
cartoon did is insensitive—please
bear in mind that Jesus suffered
these things for Y O U as much as
for me.
Laura Burgess, Geology I.
P.S. When did anyone put up
Easter decorations anyway?
