IC Hockey
Imperial College vs Royal
Holloway and Bedford New Coll
Not even free Jazz every Tuesday
at Da Vinci's Cafe Bar was
sufficient to deflect our focus from
the looming prospect of Oscar
Peterson's 'Hymn of Freedom' (see
Juke Box). We had our own
freedom in mind, conquest over the
'peinture vendeures' X I (Painting
Sellers). The £11 million exchanged
for Turner's masterpiece was not
instrumental enough to mute our
trumpeting tunes.
The game opened with a Charlie
Parker tumulteous saxophone solo,
as Holloway blew hard towards an
early lead. However, Charlie
Parker's dead, so with a flourish of
brass we took control of the game.
Our midfield came up trumps as the
virtuoso channel of Lain-Fairhurst
gainfully opened our account. The
sun was shining. (1-0.)
More beams of golden light
dance'd over Holloway's cloudy
defence. They parted again letting
Steve Ian cross from the left
allowing E Spencer Penfold to
display his spangly-collared
goalmouth panache\ no one could
believe it. We couldn't believe it,
they couldn't believe it. Perhaps we
were under the influence still in Da
Snooker
Two IC teams set out for Glasgow
and the annual university snooker
championships. Both teams got off
to bad starts against tough
opposition the ' A ' team winning
only one of three group matches and
the ' B ' team losing all three.
There were better things to come
on the second day as the ' A ' team
found their touch with an inspiring
performance from Paul Kellet who
didn't lose a frame all day and solid
play by the rest of the team. A
series of stunning victories saw the
' A ' team through to the final of the
second stream tournament with the
'B's losing in the first round. The
final was a close match against
Queens (Belfast) ' B ' team but
despite a comeback from 45 points
behind by Paul Kellet in one frame,
a string of black ball defeats put the
pressure on and the IC 'A' team had
to settle for second place. Queens
then completed a clean sweep of the
prizes winning the first stream and
singles competitions. IC will be
back next year.
Rugby 1sts Triumph
Vinci's, but no! It was real. We
were swinging like Big Bill Bronzy
and his big swing band. A slappin'
bass solo from the aforementioned
Stephen Lam was rewarded by a
trip to the floor. John Furlong
completed our treble clef of goals
from the penalty spot.
So, at half time, the score rang
like the Mardi Gras through the
smokey New Orleans atmosphere
which had strangely intoxicated us.
3-0 to IC (yipee).
In the true sense of sporting
cliches, the second half was as sick
as a parrot's hospital. We sat back
and let Holloway's wind sway
through our defensive quack grass.
Basically we were all played out, a
team waiting for the whistle. It was
not a surprise when they got one
back. A bit of suet dumpling
carefully dropped on our plate. It
woke us up and heavy limbs started
to get back on the road. Holloway
wasted their remaining
opportunities and our one-legged
long jumpers sprung into the sand
pit of victory. Chariots swung,
horns played and Imperial Hockey
Team had finally fulfilled their early
seasonal promise. (Many thanks to
our galant supporters who shouted
at us when we needed it.)

Thames Valley University—0
Despite the dry, warm conditions
which were ideal for open running
rugby, IC started in rather nervous
fashion with several passes not
going to hand and some good ball
wasted. This was no doubt due to
a combination of lack of match
practice and the team's excitement
at seeing a number of spectators
watching the action. However, the
crowd was sent into rapture at the
award of an early penalty and the
sight of fly-half Stuart 'Jean-Ba'
Paynter opening his legs to slot the
ball between the uprights. A few
mintues later, Paynter broke blind
and deftly stroked a kick through
the Thames Valley defence for left
wing Dave Bolton to catch the ball
for the first time since Christmas
and touch down in the corner.
The score remained at 8-0 until
good work by Andrew
Montgomery and Chris Telling sent
Richard Stubbs over for the first of
his two tries, which Paynter
converted to the screams of his fans
on the touch-line. Two more tries
followed before half time from
Steve Townsend, a second row who
seemed more at home on the right
wing, and from Montgomery who
crashed over from two yards out,
taking the whole opposition pack
with him. By the time Paynter
slotted the conversion, the cheer-
leaders had been forced to retire due
to exhaustion.
Sustained pressure after half time
led eventually to a pushover try for
Telling which Paynter strode up
manfully to convert. As the second
half drew to a close, IC scored
twice more. The penultimate try
came after a poor Thames Valley
clearance kick was fielded by
Stubbs who sent Roger Gilchrist
over. However the final try was the
piece de resitance of the whole
season. A great drive down the left
by the IC pack led to fast ball which
enables Paynter to utilise the pace
outside him. Quick, sharp passing
from centres Anton Fields and Nick
Finn and full back Gilchrist fed
Stubbs who managed to shrug off
the covering defence (but not his
'Fat Boy' reputation) to score in the
corner and make the final score
44-0.

PakSoc —IC Champions!!
The conclusion of the indoor soccer
tournament took place last Friday.
The Pakistan Society and Anti-
Apartheid Society teams had
reached the final after beating tough
opposition i.e. the Sikh Society and
Cypriot Society teams respectively
in the semi-finals the day before.
Both semi-finals were closely
contested with special mention for
the spirited performance put up by
the Sikh Society who played
undoubtedly their best game of the
tournament and were unlucky to
lose. The Cypriot Society team also
were unfortunate to lose to the Anti-
Apartheid Society who gave a
professional performance. Dinos
(Cypriot Society goalkeeper) was
again at his best and had a terrific
match, and deserves the award as
the goalkeeper of the tournament.
The player of the tournament
award goes to Peter D'Mello who
having scored 40 odd goals helped
the Pakistani team reach the final.
In the final he yet again scored vital
goals at vital times. He has the
uncanny ability of being at the right
place at the right time. He did this
a few times in the final, at the
frustration of the Anti-Apartheid
team. The final was a thrilling game
with the Pakistani team taking the
early initiative in the first half. They
built up a three goal lead and it
seemed as if they were sailing
towards victory. However, the
second half saw the Anti-Apartheid
Society make a spirited effort to get
back into the game. With a flowing
game, played in a good spirit and
attractive to watch there were
numerous chances, and many
chances went begging or were well
saved by the respective
goalkeepers. As the game drew on
the Anti-Apartheid team drew
within two goals of the Pakistani
team, the goal scoring attribution of
Peter D'Mello saw the Pakistani
team home, winning by three clear
goals. The final score was 8-5 to the
Pakistan Society.
The game was a great advert for
the footballing potential available
within Imperial College and the
Overseas societies. However, there
is still a need for this footballing
talent to be nurtured and given a
chance to be used at a higher level.
Overall the indoor football
tournament has proved to be a great
success. I would like to take this
opportunity to thank all the people
who have contributed and
participated in the tournament. A
special mention to the referees Alan
Bailey, Khurrum Sair, Harpreet
Cohan and Gunwant Dhadayalla for
their help.
