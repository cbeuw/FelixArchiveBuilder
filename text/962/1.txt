Elections Knocked Queen's T Splat
Apathy is as prominent as ever at
Imperial College according to a
mini survey carried out by Felix
during this week's sabbatical
elections, with the elections as a
whole coming in for a great deal of
criticism.
Although 54% of voters were
aware of the elections taking place
and what they were for only 30%
of those surveyed had bothered to
vote. The final result of New
Election for the Hon Sec post, was
echoed in the survey, with students
being unsure what the post actually
did. A large compliant from those
surveyed was the feeling that the
elections were irrelevant to the vast
majority of people. This was
demonstrated in the low turn out
during the poll when 23 % of those
eligible voted. One particular voter
based in Silwood Park, said that
everyone there had voted for New
Election, as no candidate had
considered them.
Many complained about the
candidates, saying that there was no
clear choice. Although campaigns
were better than last year, but were
obviously marred with dirty tricks.
Posters appeared just to say vote for
a candidate with manifestos and
leaflets being very short on real
policy. Many voters had real
difficulty working out actual
differences between candidates as
many seemed to agree on the vast
majority of issues.
There was a little confusion with
the voting system with a significant
number being marked with a cross
or tick, instead of the numbers as
was clearly marked on the ballot
paper.
In reply to this comment M r
Dominic Wilkinson, the current
Hon Sec (events), made a detailed
reply:
"If the electorate could not spare
a few minutes to vote then they have
little right to complain about the
quality of the incoming sabbaticals.
The opportunity to vote was given
with New Election being the option
for those dissatisfied with the
suitability of the candidates. At the
end of the day the well worn phrase
'You get what you deserve' rings
true.
I am concerned that some think
that the Union bears little relevance
to their lives. Unbeknown to them,
the work that the Union does will
touch every aspect of their time at
Imperial. This is an attitude that we
are acutely aware of and through
our increased communication with
students, via, for example, the
reaching out stalls and focus
groups, we can alter this perception
to one that more accurately reflects
the work that the Union does for
students.'
Door Damage
Wednesday saw severe damage to
the toilets in the Union Building
opposite Da Vinci's during the
'Libido' disco night.
A wall inside the Men's
lavatories was smashed leaving a
large hole. Who actually was
responsible for the damage is
unclear, but it is believed that a
large number of students who had
been drinking in the Da Vinci's bar
may have had a role. Union
Stewards on the scene said it was
possible that the damage had started
accidentally and individuals passing
through the toilets had added to the
damage as the evening progressed.
Speaking to Felix yesterday,
Chris Davidson, ICU President,
said that the matter had been
reported to the Police. He added
that if any of those responsible were
identified, criminal charges would
be brought.
The large 'splat' put on the Queens Tower last week in support of today's
comic relief day. The 'Splat' was paid for by charity donations by West
London Chaplaincy, and will be lit up tonight.
Resignation Call
by A n d r e w T s e n g
Relations between Imperial College
Union (ICU) and St Mary's
Hospital Medical School Students
Union (SMHMS SU) have taken a
turn for the worse this week
following a letter published in this
issue.
The letter by Ex-SMHMS SU
Presidents, Simon Stockill and
Simon Smith, demands the
resignation of Dominic Wilkinson,
Honorary Secretary (Events). M r
Stockill and M r Smith also demand
that the rest of the ICU Exec
distance themselves from M r
Wilkinson. The alternative that the
letter cites is the complete
separation of SMHMS SU from
ICU.
When interviewed by Felix, M r
Wilkinson said that he would be
replying to the letter privately and
would not make any further
comment. Questioned by Jonty
Beavan, the editor of Felix, M r
Wilkinson elicited a response of,
'oh go away you tedious editor'.
When asked if the rest of ICU
Exec would condemn M r
Wilkinson, Chris Davidson, I C U
President, said that it was 'not the
usual thing that it seeks to do'. He
added, given that M r Stockill and
Mr Smith were not present at he
hustings, that 'it would probably be
different if were there'.
