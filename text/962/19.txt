The Power Station brings
Dostoyevky's famous novel back on
stage, adapted by Stephen Sharkey
and directed by Thomas Baker. The
Gambler is a story of Russians
abroad, especially those who
gathered in the European spas and
gambling resorts with which the
author himself was all too familiar.
Luckily, the Gambler is not
devoted to philosophising or to
recollection of the distant past
which is so common for
Dostoyevsky's world. There are, it
is true, moments of reflection on
gambling: 'Round and round the
wheel she goes, and where she
stops—nobody knows', or on the
attitude of Russian women to
Frenchmen. But play is based upon
a tale of passion, intrigue and public
scandal.
Alexie Ivanovich, the gambler
himself (Andy MacKay) is
obsessive and emotionally disturbed
in his relations with other people.
The main objects of his obsessions
are gambling and a beautiful young
Russian women, Polina (Sian
Jenkins). Polina is also adored by
an English aristocrat, and French
Marquis and that is what makes the
story complicated, but interesting at
the same time.
Andy McKay as Alexei gave a
very good performance.
Furthermore, the dramatic
appearance of Grandmother (Eve
Shickle) was very notable. A
presumably fatally ill old woman
showed up unexpectedly and
instantly disrupted all plans the
group had built upon expectations
of her death.
The idea of presenting roulette as
a pattern on a floor with each player
standing on their choices, supported
with appropriate lights and sounds,
was very impressive. But at the end
it was one of those mild
performances which are either not
too good, or not too bad, just
enough that at the end of the night
you won't feel anything (apart from
cold feet).

The Gambler
J u l i u s C a e s a r
Students should like this theatre due
to its address—basement of the
Barons Ale House. The noises of
the pub above, however, are not too
noticeable and the play is
enthralling enough not to plan a
quick dash upstairs for a pint.
This is not a play for Shakespeare
traditionalists. The title itself is
misleading and should read 'Julia
Caesar'. Many slight changes in the
script are necessary to incorporate
this. Now in the play is a reporter,
complete with tape recorder. T-
shirts, togas sum up the show, and
during the scene where Mark
Antony mourns Caesars death and
kneels, my eyes were drawn to the
legend printed on the soles of his
espadrilles 'Made in Bangladesh'.
The battle at Phillipi was well
staged and made a strong
impression on my mind. Complete
with flak jackets and the sound of
machine gun fire, Brutus more-
than-makes-up for his slightly weak
performance in the first act and is
very convincing as a man tormented
by his past.
This production gives a new twist
to the original, but I somehow
wonder if it would have been better
to stick to the text rigidly as the
mixing of old (daggers and togas)
and the new (TV cameras and
radio) at times seemed a bit
incongruous.

Julius Caesar
Play with C o c a i n e
Play with Cocaine is set at the turn
of the century against a background
of imminent revolution, decadence
and dispair. The play is not
primarily concerned with an
adolescent's addiction to cocaine
but with the current lack of social
and political cohesion.
The story follows Vadine's
increasing inability to relate to the
people in the world around him: his
poverty stricken mother, his
revolutionary schoolmate and his
married lover, all of whom offer
him glimpses of love and fulfilment.
However the escape provided by
cocaine with its instant happiness,
achieved with little effort, time and
energy is by far his preferred
option.
Despite being somewhat
disjointed we follow Vadine as he
turned away from those who cared
and immersed himself in a world of
hallucination. The second half was
highly emotive and one watched
with increasing horror as the story
unfolded.
Adapted by Deidra Morris from
a Russian novel by M Agayav, this
play was well produced and
deserves to be seen.
