IC Dance
Last Sunday, IC hosted the Inter-
Varsity Dancing Championships,
the biggest inter-University dance
event of the year. No grubby sports
centre or church hall for us; the
venue was the Great Room of the
Grosvenor House, Park Lane, a
magnificent ballroom and amazing
backdrop to the 30th annual event.
The big guns of Oxford and
Cambridge were well represented,
together with 19 other universities
at IC. The pressure was on us; not
only had IC won the IV for the past
two years, but had also swept the
board at the Sheffield and Southern
Balls earlier this term. Cambridge
Can't Pay?
Won't Pay!
After presenting the 'Twelfth
Night' last December, DramSoc
gives a jump both in time and in
space to present this term 'Can't
Pay? Won't Pay!' by one of Italy's
most important twentieth century
has even resorted to the desperate
measure of rearranging their entire
A Team, in a final bid for victory.
In the past 29 years, only the 4
couples comprising each A Team
had competed at the IV. This year,
a B Team competition was also
arranged. IC must have been
favourites for this, too: at the
Southern Ball, we beat all other B's,
only narrowly missing Cambridge
A. However, a different marking
system and 3 weeks frenzied
practice by the other universities
suggested 2 very close
competitions.
The afternoon programme, of
Exploding Heads
Tomorrow, Saturday 13th March,
ICSF is pleased to be holding its
11th small one day convention
(hence called Picocon 11) in the
Union building. Entry is just £1 to
members (membership £3) and gets
you into all manner of events,
quizzes, video showing, book and
comic trading, panels and talks.
OUr main guest this year is the
renowned SF author Colin
Greenland, who will be reading
from his latest, unpublished novel
and prizes for competitions through
the day include a complete set of his
published novels.
The theme of ICSF's next double-
bill is Canadian horror director
David Cronenberg. On Monday at
6pm, we'll start with a showing of
his famous 'Scanners'. Cameron
Vale, a wandering tramp, is a
scanner, possessing the ability to
tune into and control other people's
nervous systems, as a result of
which he is hunted by a mysterious
organisation of scanners who are
responsible for a number of
assassinations. As the net tightens
around him, Vale learns that the
other scanners' aims are far more
sinister than at first they appear and
that he must destroy the leader of
the organisation in a sanner duel to
stop his heinous plot. The film has
a great cast (Patrick McGoohan
from 'The Prisoner' and Michael
Ironside from ' V and 'Total
Recall') and some terrific exploding
heads too.
At 8pm, we have 'Videodrome'
featuring James Woods and Debbie
Harry. Woods plays a cable T V
programmer who gets involved
with a chat show host (Harry) and
who stumbles across a snuff/SM
T V channel. The more he watches
it, the more unable he is to stop
watching it and the more
hallucinations (or are they?) he
suffers from. Eventually he
descends into, a state of existence
where he cannot define the
boundary between reality and his
drug-crazed imagination and where
he may or may not be a pawn in the
hands of a political megalomaniac.
This movie features some strikingly
unusual sex (!), violence and
gruesomeness (if you're likely to be
offended, don't turn up). It also acts
as a suitable precursor to the
director's later film 'Naked Lunch'
whith its drug-induced illusions and
also relates to the novels of Philip
K Dick (source of 'Bladerunner'
and 'Total Recall') with its themes
of defining absolute reality.
The films start at 6pm on Monday
the 15th in Chem Eng LT1. Entry
is free to members and membership
is just £3.
Foxtrot and Samba, with a
Quickstep for the Beginners, saw
some fine individual performances.
Several IC couples made the finals,
and Satin and Shelagh won the BCD
Samba. This was the warm-up for
the main event, the Team
Competitions, starting dead on time
(rather than the more usual hour late
at such events).
All of the IC couples made their
respective finals—but Oxford,
Cambridge, Bristol and Liverpool
(to name but 4) were well
represented here, too. While nails
were bitten, we were entertained by
a professional Latin American
playwrights, Dario Fo.
Dario Fo, probably best known
in this country as the author of
'Accidental Death of an Anarchist'
is not only a play writer but also a
political activist.
The production we are staging is
an extremely funny political farce
about a strike by London
housewives against price rises,
although the original is set in Italy.
So if you feel like spending an
evening of laughter, come to see
this comedy full of 'anarchy, theft,
class war and bopping the fuzz'
which is bound to 'extract
whooping laughter from social
injustice'
'Can't Pay? Won't Pay!
Wednesday 17th to Saturday 20th
March, 7.30pm, Union Concert
Hall, £2 (£1 cones).
demo and the Offbeat Competition.
The latter is a Team event which is
marked on both dancing ability and
entertainment value. Tracks ranged
from 'It's Raining Men' to some
Manchester 'Madness'.
Finally the results. Both A and B
competitions were decided by the
last dance, the Jive. But we did it:
retained the A trophy, put our
names on the new B trophy, and
carried off the Offbeat with a 20's
Lindy-Hop/Charleston. After the
Last Waltz, we retired to the JCR,
for a celebratory party (and of
course, more dancing!).
Thanks are due to the IV
organisers, and our trainers.
OpSoc
Opsoc would like to announce a
workshop on the musical 'Guys &
Dolls'. Rehearsals will be on
Tuesday 16th March, 7.30pm,
Huxley 308 and Sunday 21st

Anybody is welcome, we hope to
see you there. For more
