One of my few exstatic moments in
recent months has to be listening to
this.
A moment of pure exhultation—
Cocker lifts an average ditty to
produce something that we all
need—fun. The virtues of 'pure
pop' may be, being forced down
peoples' throats at the moment, and
most of what is being promoted is
utter crap, but here are some people
who know what they're doing.
Heavenly.
Peb.
S p i n d o c t o r s — A Pocketful of
Kryptonite
Right from the opening chords of
'Jimmy Olsen Blues' the
Spindoctors reach out, take your
hand and lead you into their strange
and wonderous world; where all is
not what it seems and everyone has
a good time. Tipping their hats to
Southern boogie and the alternative
jammin' blues scene, they play a
heady mix of funk roots with a dash
of fusion jazz leanings.
The first single 'Little Miss Can't
Be Wrong' is the most accessible
track; but the most satisfying is the
stompin' '2 Princes'. Full of
swirling delights and the odd
crunchy guitar bit, it made me feel
like a toad on a hot tin roof. (A
frying brain say all asundry.) But

Once I was infatuated. I had a
passionate belief that somehow the
future would be better. It would
have to be, how could things get
worse. But that dream is fading. All
too much I see the future unfolding
in the same way as the past—can
things ever change? I mean, sure,
superficially things change—but
somehow despite an intitial glint of
originality things become dulled by
time. The most radical of changes
soon falls into the same rut,
following the same course until
some new favourites arrive.

then alas, the other 8 tracks are
lightweights. Certainly simmering
away nicely yet not fulfilling their
early promise. I guess the problem
is that The Spindoctors'
concentration on live work means
that they never quite spark in the
confines of a studio. The live bonus
tracks are proofof the pudding. 'To
Mamas a Pajama' lashes out, easily
ellipsing most of the earlier stuff,
and 'Sweet Widow' isn't far
behind.
Despite which all is not lost. As
if by magic, Spindoctors play U L U
on 18th March. The choice is
yours, and I'm off for a couple of
flies.

If you don't relish the thought of
attending the Union on a Thursday
night to see a group of College
bands pissing about on stage before
they've learned to play their
instruments, I wouldn't blame you.
However I did go on Thursday and
was pleasantly surprised. The
second band Ash, Ask or some such
name, were dead good. I'm not
alone in thinking this as it was the
only one which attracted (and kept)
an audience.
I have to admit to a little prejudice
S u e d e — C a m b r i d g e J u n c t i o n
Cambridge is like a big Turkey
Shoot, one huge, lazy, sleepy
essentially dead-end town in the
fens. Apart from the university, it's
Dodge, and Butch and Sundance
have just rolled in off the 1415 from
Kings Cross.
Long, black coated, and armed,
tooth high with 35mm, we strode
disdainfully northwards, staring
down the witless undergraduates
with their swanking scarves and
Oxbridge haircuts, northwards,
northwards, into the belly of Sidney
Sussex College, an old friend, and
there to await the coming of Godot
in his now notorious alter-ego, Brett
Anderson.
Pencils sharpened, pints sunk,
stories told and scores settled, the
hour is nigh. We brave flatland gale
and intermittent flurries in pursuit
of the Junction, and nirvana. Car
parks, railway bridges, nothing
sways us, we are steeled in purpose.
Motivated and determined.
Ah...the Grail! We approach.
' They would have rung and told
us if they'd taken us off the Guest
List, I sorted it all out weeks
ago.' (here, Jane is
defamed).
One of the musketeers is broken
and prepares to flee shamed and
refuted, but the one known as Ralph
is steadfast and resolute. He surveys
all before him for our salvation.
(Brain ticks over, odds are weighed.
Twat bouncers no. Tunnel
in no. Find women with tickets
and use inherent charm, dash and
intrepidity to win their
hearts and their stubs. Left
eyebrow migrates deftly skywards
and evil grin ensues.)
Following a short briefing, two
teenies - simultaneously spotty and
as I know a couple of the members,
but arbitrating myself, they showed
definite promise. They can all play
their instruments—strangely it
helps, and the girl up front can sing,
which really does make a change.
All in all, for a first time live
performance it was remarkably
right and if they play again, go and
see them. Even if it is on a
Thursday night.
Ian.
(For that is a good name for
music reviewers.)
rough - are selected, and ten
minutes, stupid bouncers, and open
lavatory windows later, Felix has
bluffed its way into the most un-
bluff your way intoable gig in the
land. - Cheers Jane.
Bang! gomorrah. Heat, sweat,
teenies jumping around to Sharkboy
and spilling Snakebite down my
jeans. 10pm explodes with an
energy and sexual vitriola, the like
neither of us had before witnessed.
'Animal Nitrate' opens. Several
songs later, 'Metal Mickey', and I
begin to register my situation.
Loose, very much so, but this adds
to the spectacle. And it is a
spectacle, a sideshow, a quirky
timeless adventure into the land of
shrunken denim, and flailing beads.
The Two Ronnies with three
straight men. I should hate this, and
I wish I did, but it's just so
attractive, you can't help yourself.
'Sleeping Pills', 'Painted People',
and the ultimate, ' M y Insatiable
One'. Raw, naked and writhing, the
masses jump and fawn, but as
quickly as they came they went. A
stunned mob is left, heated and
expectant. Not quite to point B the
house lights rise, and one can
almost here the strains of 'You'll
never walk alone' and a massive
Boo ! Heard it before ?
As one of the teenies commented
before Mum came. ' We all missed
The Smiths.' Anderson obviously
didn't, his Bowiephilic claims fall
horribly short here, and their
unfortunate change of tack into style
plagiarism is a step backwards.
50 minutes and no encore? Pass
the daffs Steven.
