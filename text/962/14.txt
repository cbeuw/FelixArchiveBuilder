Tapping the Source
Save the Rainforests! support the
rubber-tappers?
Rubber-tappers have been in the
Amazon since the end of the 19th
century when the world market for
rubber was expanding, and migrant
male workers were recruited by
managers of rubber estates.
Rubber is collected between May
and December, then during the
rainy season Brazil nuts are
collected. Rubber-tapper
communities are small (settlements
typically consist of 4 or 5 houses),
economically viable, and largely
self-sufficient. A rubber tree can
yield latex for over 50 years.
Though rubber tappers work
individually, the formation of
cooperatives is an integral part of
a new range of survival skills that
they have had to learn. Only
together can they be strong enough
to resist the threat to their way of
life, and to the very existence of the
forst—the opening up of the
Amazon region to the cattle
companies.
The ownership of the forest is
legally unclear. The rubber-tappers
assert their rights to the land as
being at least as good as anyone
else's. However, they are often
unaware that pieces of paper have
been exchanged in the cities, until
the logging crews move in.
With each tiny community of
tappers often many days' journey
from each other, it was difficult for
them to meet and plan a response
to the land grabs. A lack of
education compounded the
problem.
Then in the late 1970s a local
voluntary group began Project
Serigueiro (Project Rubber-Tapper)
with funding initially from Oxfam.
Project workers opened up the
possibility of forming cooperatives
so that the tappers could market
their own rubber. They also
estbalished schools where initially
adults, then later children, could
become literate and numerate.
Chico Mendes, for many years the
leader of the rubber-tappers,
described the importance of
schooling:
'My life began just like that of all
rubber-tappers, as a virtual slave
bound to do the bidding of his
master. I started work at nine years
old, and, like my father before me,
instead of learning my A B C , 1
learnt how to extract latex from a
Tapping in progress
rubber tree. From the last century
until 1970, schools were forbidden
on any rubber estate in the Amazon.
The rubber estate owners
wouldn't allow it. Firstly, because
if a rubber-trapper's children went
to school, they would learn to read,
to write, and to add up, and would
discover to what extent they were
being exploited. That wasn't in the
bosses' interests. Also, it was better
for production to have the children
available for work rather than at
school.
So for many years, the great
majority of us could neither read
nor write. The rubber-tapper
worked all year hoping he would
finally make a profit, but always
remained in debt. As he couldn't
count, he couldn't tell whether or
not he was being cheated.
Project Seringueito brought the
rubber-trappers together, and along
with education came organisation.
The first rubber-tappers unions
were formed in 1975 and many
others followed. In 1985, the
National Council of Rubber-
Tappers was formed to coordinate
their activities. This level of
organisation has given them the
power to defend their way of life,
and with it the rainforest. Their
standard response to the arrival of
a logging crew within one of their
areas has become the empate—a
peaceful organisation. Chico
Mendes described the technique:
'When a community is threatened
by deforestation, it gets in touch
with other communities in the area.
They all get together in a mass
meeting inthe middle of the forest
and organise teams of people to take
the lead in confronting the workers
cutting down the trees—all this in
a peaceful but organised way. These
teams try to convince the workers
employed by the landowners to
leave the area. The rubber-tappers
also dismantle the camps used by
those workers to force them out...
At the same time as 180 or 200
colleagues are involved in the
empate, standing in the way of the
chain-saw and the scythes, we aim
to have a team whose job it is to get
information about what is
happening to Xapuri, where another
group will make sure it travels all
over Brazil and the rest of the
world.
For us the important thing is to
continue to make a political impact.
We feel our resistance can produce
results through pressure by the
press and lobbying organisations, at
both national and international
level.'
The rubber-tappers have learnt
that the real threats come from far
beyond the forest—from the inter-
governmental lending agencies like
the World Bank, and the Inter-
American Development flank, and
from the headquarters of
transnational corporations. Hence
they have built up an impressive
range of alliances with Third World
and Green movements in North
America and Europe. They have
testified to the UN's Bruntland
Commission on the environment,
and have lobbied the World Bank.
Chico Mendes was assassinated
in December 1988.
The rubber-tappers' struggle goes
on. Central to their efforts is theii
own strength, and their alliances
within Brazil. In 1989, togethei
with groups representing indiginous
peoples, they created the Alliance
of Forest Peoples.
'To defend the Amazon you have
to support the unions, the women's
organisations, the residents'
associations. Since Chico's death
the press have started calling him
an ecologist. But he always called
himself a trade unionist. We don't
see any distinction between
environmentalism, and trade
unionism.'
(Atanagildo Matos, National
Council of Rubber-Tappers).
On Tuesday 23th March, Third
World First and EnviroSoc are to
hold ' A Night of Brazilia' in the
Union starting at 8.30pm. All the
proceeds from ticket sales (£2 each)
will be going to the Brazilian
Rubber-Tappers' Union. Come
along and show your support.
