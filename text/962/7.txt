Keogh Kick Ass
Give Away
Was Saturday cold? I don't recall
catching frostbite when I ventured
out to Sainsbury's... or slipping on
ice, or even having to dig my way
out through snowdrifts up to my
earlobes. So what happened to all
you people? One of the best
opportunities this term to get out of
London and collect a bit of money,
have a bit of fun and win a luvverly
prize and only a few wonderful and
dedicated collectors turn up!
Disgraceful.
Fisher managed to muster two
Dozeners - pretty poor by most
people's standards, but a brave
effort all the same. Willis Jackson
did rather better, and sent out eight
collectors to Reading, raising a
staggering £700 and almost making
up for the apathy radiating from
some of the other halls. Falmouth
Keogh, on the other hand, not only
sent eight enthusiastic Dozeners to
Guildford, to collect £750 for the
Leonard Cheshire Foundation, but
also put in an appearance at the
QPR v Norwich football match,
If you had been at last week's Rag
meeting, you would have witnessed
a very rare event - the giving away
of money by Rag! Our very own
Rag Chair, Rachel, steeled herself
to do what doesn't come naturally
to a Raggie, and presented two
cheques, totalling over £3000, to
representatives from charities
nominated to receive a share of last
year's money. Martin Poole from
the World Wildlife Fund for Nature
accepted a cheque for £1506.79
(well, he wasn't very likely to
which raised over £1400!
Admittedly, this was with a little
help fom other Raggies, but it all
goes towards making Falmouth
Keogh the out-and-out champions
when it comes to persuading the
public to part with its money.
Congratulations are in order for
all those that bothered to turn up,
in what must obviously have been
extremely adverse conditions. For
their efforts, the Falmouth Keogh
team win certain alcoholic
substances, the details of which
have yet to be released. Whatever
the prize is, though, it will doubtiess
be appreciated!
Also to be applauded are all those
who have helped Rag beat the
£50,000 mark. Yes, the total is
currently standing at a massive
£55,193.98 with over a term left to
go! A huge thanx to everybody who
has collected, organised, been
hassled for sponsorship money,
jumped off a crane and generally
taken part - you are all brilliant and
we love you!
refuse, was he?!), and Louise
Massert received £1506.75 on
behalf of Turning Point.
The overall total raised last year
was an amazing £39,796.83 some
of which has still to be presented to
the relevant charities, so watch out
for more large cheques at future
Rag meetings. This year's dosh will
be given out at Rag Fete in May -
an event I am not going to start
plugging yet, but which you will
hear plenty about nearer the time!
Uns(t)ung
Apologies to anyone who signed up
for the Sting concerts on Monday,
Tuesday or Wednesday this week -
Sting has laryngitis and has had to
postpone these until April. We
expect to obtain permission to
collect at these as well, on the
19-21st, but as this is during the
Easter break (I won't call it a
holiday as so many people have
exams when they return!) this might
cause problems! If you still want to
collect on one of these dates, call
into the Rag Orifice and see Lorna
or Womble.
Bristol
Rag Raid
Just a quick reminder - tomorrow
sees the departure of a courageous
band of collectors, heading towards
the wilds of Bristol on a mission
from Rag. Raising money by
raising hell (have I used that phrase
before? Tough - I like it!) these
thirteen raggies will be rewarded
for their efforts by the chance to
relax, socialise and generally piss
about with other raggies from
places as far afield as Exeter and -
er- Bristol! It should be a fun day
anyhow, so make sure you reserve
YOUR seat at today's Rag meeting.
Oh, Tim Atkinson has generously
offered his services as driver so at
least you are guaranteed safe
transport to and from Bristol...!
