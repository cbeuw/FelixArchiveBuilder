Jobs Holocaust
b y D e c l a n C u r r y
The University of London has been
accused of starting a 'jobs holocaust
across colleges and institutes' by
London trade unions. Tom Snow,
London area officer for the National
Union of Public Employees
(NUPE), says that plans by the
University to make 98 cleaners
redundant are a breach of
University employment protection
regulations. M r Snow says that the
University plans to save money will
'exploit the poverty trap of the
private cleaning market in London.'
Peter Howell, a principal of one
of the University colleges, denied
the University was breaking the
law, and said that the cleaners were
being offered severance terms
'twice as good as the statutory
requirement.' NUPE claims that
some staff are only being offered 12
weeks pay if they leave work
immediately. The University says
the redundancies will save 47% of
the cleaning budget. The cleaners,
who work in 6 of the 8
intercollegiate Halls of Residences,
are to be served with notices of
dismissal on 19th March. In past
redundancy cases, redundancy
orders were served with 90 days
notice.
Deans Change
by A n d r e w T s e n g
The two largest constituent colleges
will have new Deans come the next
academic year.

Guilds College at the end of
September. He makes way for
Professor Julia Higgins, currently
the College's Senior Tutor, who
will hold the position from October
1 to 31 August 1994.
The new Dean of the Royal
College of Science will be Professor
John Pendry, from the Department
of Physics. He replaces Professor
Trevor Stuart and has been elected
to hold the position from 1
September to 31 August 1996.
The Deans of St Mary's and the
Royal School of Mines,
respectively Professor Peter
Richards and Professor Tim Shaw,
continue in their current post.
IC Virtuoso
by D e c l a n Curry
A 17 year old violinist will take
centre stage tonight for the spring
conceit from Imperial College
Orchestra. Lucy Jeal, studying in
the Royal College of Music, will
play solo violin in Tchaikovsky's
'Violin Concerto'. The concert,
which begins in the Great Hall at
8pm, will also include Debussy's
'Nocturnes', and Stravinsky's 'Rite
of Spring'. Miss Jeal, a pupil at
local Westminster School, has
played in several major venues in
London, including the Royal
Festival Hall and the Queen
Elizabeth Hall. The concert will be
conducted by Imperial's Richard
Dickens.
Counselling Call
by D e c l a n Curry
Schools and colleges have been
ordered to pay more attention to
student counselling. Tim Bos well,
the Higher Education Minister, said
that high drop out rates in further
education were due to insufficient
attention being paid to students and
their progress. M r Bos well added
that counselling may be one of the
new performance indicators for
future further education funding.
More student counselling is
provided in higher education than
in further education. Don
Adlington, Student Counsellor at
Imperial College, said that there
were arguments to show that
counselling had an effect on drop-
out rates in higher education. 'It is
almost certainly true that students
stay in the university system due to
counselling support through
difficult periods,' he said. Legal,
debt, financial and immigration
advice is provided by Stef Ruis,
Imperial College Union Advisor.
Mr Ruis can be contacted on
internal extension 3507, and is
available between Monday and
Thursday, except for Wednesday
morning. M r Adlington has an
office on the first floor of 15
Prince's gardens, and can be
contacted on internal extension
3041. He can see students during
normal office hours, and says that
he is 'always anxious to see people
quickly.'
Food Fight!
Mary's studentsjoin in their annualfood fight at Charing Cross Hospital.
Some years the fire brigade have been called to clear up the mess.
C&G Hustings
by A n d r e w T s e n g
The first ever City and Guilds
College Union (C&GCU) hustings
occurred on Tuesday.
Very few new policies or ideas
were brought forward. Standing for
the post of President, Paul Griffith
proposed a City and Guilds Sports
Day. And in a year that has seen the
Constituent College Unions lose
their student appeal, Joe Baguley,
standing for Vice President, called
for C & G C U to increase its profile.
Of those posts available only the
post of the City and Guilds College
Association Representative sees a
member of this year's C & G C U
Exec standing.
The most closely contested post
looks set to be that of Ents Chair.
Tim Atkinson, who last year was
defeated in the election for the post
of Honorary Junior Treasurer,
stands against Subhashis
Chowdhury. M r Chowdhury has
promised an increase in the number
of joint events with other
Universities.
New Election will be standing for
all posts. Voting will take place in
C & G Department Foyers on 15th
and 16th March from 12-2pm.
Silwood Outreach
by D e c l a n Curry
Imperial College Union (ICU) held
another 'outreach' stall on
Wednesday of this week. Members
of ICU staff travelled to Silwood
Park at Ascot to meet students and
raise awareness of the Union. Chris
Davidson, ICU President, said that
the event was a 'very successful
day', adding that Silwood students
were 'pleased with the effort made
in bringing the Union to them'.
After a tour of research labs and
facilities, M r Davidson, along with
Michelle Began, Union
Receptionist, and Stef Ruis, Union
Advisor, held a meeting with
Silwood students. M r Davidson said
that students at Silwood were
disappointed that they did not
qualify for the 'London weighting'
for local authority maintenance
grants, and also had problems with
catering and accommodation. M r
Davidson added that he would be
looking at grant levels and the levels
of food pricing at Silwood. Rick
Bilby, I C U Deputy President,
would look at accommodation
matters. The Silwood stall follows
on from a similar stall set up
recently in the Junior Common
Room (JCR) at South Kensington.
Imperial College Union is said to be
pleased with response to this first
stall.
