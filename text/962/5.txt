Catering Department
Dear Jonty,
I would like to correct the
inaccuracies in the article by Gareth
Light on the Catering Department,
Felix 959.
The Catering Department has not
lost £450,000 or £VS million last
year. The catering department's
figures were not released last week,
but to the Advisory Group on
Catering and Bars on 16 October
1992. There was a trading deficit
of £319,000, and interest payments
on capital loans totalled a further
£90,750.
There is no relation whatsoever
between the Catering department's
trading position and Linstead Hall
Bar.
The catering service to students
has not remained under constant
criticism.
Southside Bar had not lost in the
region of £25,000 so far this year.
It has made a trading surplus of
£21,973, which after central
administration costs nets down to a
surplus of £8,358.
The bar is not 7% down on
projected income. It is 18% down.
It's 6:10 pm and I'm at IC Radio
to be interviewed on the new
'Thirty Minutes' programme
concerning the Photographic
Society. The show will commence
at 6:30 pm. Paul, the host, has
cunningly tricked me into arriving
early on the pretence that we'd be
able to go through the interview
beforehand and maybe discuss the
simulation coursework we both
have to submit by Friday. In fact the
real reason I'm here is that Paul
doesn't smoke, and wingeing at me
is his only alternative to the dreaded
cancer stick.
'Oh Owain it's six fifteen and no-
one's here' he pleads, in a voice I
had thought the exclusive domain of
my spoilt little sisters. He goes
through the running order again. Do
seven two's make fourteen? Yes
Paul. What shall I talk to the
Orchestra about? Err, music Paul?
What if nobody turns up? Then
you're fucked Paul.
At a big table five hacks are
playing trumps. They are
completely unconcerned by Paul's
Cleese-like hysteria, joking amiably
and throwing empty anythings at
each other. Hacks at home. They
never seem to do anything, just
The Advisory Group on Catering
and Bars did not complain to I C U
about anything—its membership
comprises four representatives from
ICU. The chairman asked for
information from the students about
happy hours. How could a
committee, 50% of whose members
are from I C U , complain about
itself.
The financial errors and
misunderstandings that you refer to
in the context of Linstead Bar are
in no way connected with me, the
Catering Department, or my future
as a license holder. Could you
please make clear that you did not
intend to call in to question my
financial probity and integrity.
Gordon Marshall is not in overall
control of Catering. The
department, through me, reports to
the Deputy Managing Director, Dr
Rodney Eastwood.
Felix should take care not to
publish inaccurate, misleading or
distorted material.
Yours sincerely,
Simon Westerman,
Catering Manager.
exist in their little world, absorbing
the atmosphere like Komodo
dragons bathing in the sun. At hack
school (ie Southside first year) they
are taught to be the three fs.
Friendly, funny and functionless.
Standing there I feel like I've
intruded on some rumbustious
family gathering, listening to a close
knit banter reminiscent of the
penultimate scene in The Godfather
II.
6:22pm and so far only the 'Gun
and Pistol' person and myself have
arrived. A door opens and the
famous Celtic news editor summons
Paul with businesslike Irish
precision. Through the window of
the office I see Paul explaining his
schedule, whilst the news ed pulls
at his hair and answers telephones.
A n assistant creeps in, the
momentarily open door revealing a
tantalising 'What the bloody hell do
you mean -' Two minutes later
they're out again and moving into
the studio. I receive bad news.
'All right Owain' says Paul,
'Neither The Japanese society nor
the Orchestra have arrived yet so
you've been moved to first place.'
Camera pulls back to reveal Owain
Culkin's hands clapped over ears
staring into the audience and
screaming. First? First! I fully
appreciate that most of the listeners
to this show are probably in this
very room but at that moment I feel
like someone's said 'Owain, her
Majesty can't make it, would you
mind stepping in for her at the
Queen's speech? Ta awfully'. A
hack trumps another and then
playfully thumps him. The station
manager explains how if they'd
only followed his instructions they
would have had fourteen tricks and
a holiday in Jamaica. And I panic.
'Get him in here' yells editor in
chief and I'm bundled into the tiny
studio. 'Talk into that' says Paul,
sweating. I look at the microphone,
which promptly falls over. Whilst
I'm trying to repair it (6:29:30 pm)
the Japanese Soc member appears
at the door. 'Sorry, I was in the
toilet.' 'Get him out of here' yells
the news ed, and I'd dumped back
outside the soundproof door. Fiery
business this live radio.
Outside we listen to the shows
birthing. Jingle, sting then 'Hello,
your listening to Thirty Minutes and
this is your host Paul Dias...' The
Japanese interview seems to go
okay, he implores the audience to
come and watch a cartoon about a
rabbit with an exploding head. All
too soon it's my turn.
I stand there like a contestant in
Bullseye deciding whether to go for
'Bullies Star Prize'. The whole
world is waiting at the other end of
that microphone. It's a faintiy
ridiculous interview.
'So Owain, what's it like in the
darkroom?' 'Err, dark Paul.' 'So
Owain, the exhibition consists
mainly of photographs?' 'Some
would say entirely Paul.' I forget
the name of the room in which
we're exhibiting and stumble.
Paul's going 'Well, isn't it the
C.Con..Consort Gallery?' like a
muppet on Sesame street. But I
survive. It's a weird experience, the
pressure of having to be somewhere
for several minutes, and having to
produce responses there and then.
I feel a more educated man as the
news ed screams 'Okay, thank you,
get him out!' And I smirk superiorly
at those yet to go, although they
don't seem particularly worried. I
must have inspired confidence.
The show proceeds fairly well,
except for a small disaster when
Paul commences an interview by
asking the 'Rifle and Pistol'
member why he likes to jump out
of aeroplanes. And the surreal
choice of music, a selection of 1987
'classics'. But Paul gets through
without requiring hospitalisation,
the news ed smiles and swears he
won't be able to do that every week
and every one is happy. Except a
hack with a punctured bicycle tyre.
We grin at him as we leave.
