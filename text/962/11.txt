Too X-treme?
Zaeem Sivardeen shows the side of Malcolm X not revealed in Spike
Lee's film, that of a true muslim.
More than twenty-eight years after
his death, Malcolm-X—Alhajj
Malik El-Shabazz—still towers over
the Statue of Liberty. He refuses to
die. And with the release of Spike
Lee's film X this Friday the 5th of
March, his memory continues to
live.
With the film has come the hype.
Everyone claims him to be of
them—from civil rights activists to
black nationalists; from rappers to
even socialists (!). And of course,
there are the Muslims, who also
claim him. Afterall, it was Islam
that Malcolm X advocated as a
solution to the Race Problem. At
first he was a member of the deviant
black nationalist group, so called
"The Nation of Islam' and then after
his Pilgrimage to Mecca he reverted
to mainstream Islam. His period in
mainstream Islam was short—and
as a result the film X does not cover
it in great detail, but this short part
of his life was the most important
part. The ideas he had at this time
were the ideas which he died
with—indeed, it was probably
because of these new ideas he had,
based on mainstream Islam, that he
was killed.
Below is a letter he wrote to 'his
loyal assistants in Harlem....from
his heart.'
'Never have I witnessed such
sincere hospitality and the
overwhelming spirit of true
brotherhood as is practised by
people of all colours and races here
in this ancient Holyland, the home
of Abraham and Muhammed... For
the past week, I have been utterly
speechless and spellbound by the
graciousness I see displayed all
around me by people of all
colours...
...There were tens of thousands
of pilgrims, from all over the
world. They were of all colours,
from blue-eyed blondes to black-
skinned Africans. But we were all
participating in the same ritual,
displaying a spirit of unity and
brotherhood that my experiences in
America had led me to believe
never could exist between the white
and non-white.
America needs to understand
Islam, because this is the one
religion that erases the race
problem. Throughout my travels in
the Muslim World, I have met,
talked to, and even eaten with
people who in America would have
been considered 'white'—but the
'white' attitude was removed from
their minds by the religion of Islam.
I have never before seen sincere and
true brotherhood practised by all
colours together, irrespective of
their colour.
You may be shocked by these
words coming from me. But on
this pilgrimage, what I have seen,
and experienced, has forced me to
rearrange much of my thought
patterns previously held, and to toss
aside some of my previous
conclusions. This was not too
difficult for me. Despite my firm
convictions, I have been always a
man who tries to face facts, and to
accept the reality of life as new
experience and new knowledge
unfolds it. I have always kept an
open mind, which is necessary to
the flexibility that must go hand in
hand with every form of intelligent
search for truth.
During the past eleven days here
in the Muslim World, I have eaten
from the same plate, drunk from the
same glass, and slept in the same
bed (or on the same rug)—while
praying to the same God—with
fellow Muslims, whose eyes were
the bluest of blue, whose hair was
the blondest of blonde, and whose
skin was the whitest of white. And
in the words and in the deeds and
in the actions of the 'white' Muslim,
I felt the same sincerity that I felt
among the black African Muslims
of Nigeria, Sudan, and Ghana.
We were truly all the same
(brothers)—because of their belief
in One God had removed the
'white' from their minds, the
'white' from their behaviour, and
the 'white' from their attitude.
I could see from this, that perhaps
if white Americans could accept the
Oneness of God, then perhaps too,
they could accept in reality the
Oneness of Man—and cease to
measure, and hinder, and harm
others in terms of their 'differences'
in colour.
With racism plaguing America
like an incurable cancer, the so-
called 'Christian' white American
heart should be more receptive to
a proven solution to such a
destructive problem. Perhaps it
could be in time to save America
from imminent disaster—the same
destruction brought upon Germany
by racism that eventually destroyed
the Germans themselves.
Each hour here in the Holyland
enables me to have greater spiritual
insights into what is happening in
America between black and white.
The American Negro never can be
blamed for his social animosities—
he is only reacting to four hundred
years of the conscious racism of the
American whites. But as racism
leads America up the suicide path,
I do believe, frm the experiences
that I have had with them, that the
whites of the younger generation,
in the colleges and universities, will
see the hand-writing onthe wall and
many of them will turn to the
spiritual path of truth—the. only way
left to American to ward off the
disaster that racism inevitably leads
to.
Never have I been so highly
honoured-. Never have I been made
to feel more humble and unworthy.
Who would believe the blessings
that have been heaped upon an
American Negro? A few nights
ago, a man who would be called in
America a 'white' man, a United
Nations diplomat, an ambassador,
a companion of kings, gave me his
hotel suite, his bed.
Never would I have even thought
of dreaming that I would ever be a
recipient of such honours—honours
that in America would be bestowed
upon a king—not a Negro.
All praise is due to Allah, the
Lord of All the Worlds.
Sincerely,
El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.
(Malcolm X ) .
It's quite clear that Malcolm X ,
after going through much
experience came to the conclusion
that mainstream Islam—the love
and obedience of the One Creator
of the Worlds—and not black
Nationalism nor the deviant 'Nation
of Islam', nor socialism (!), is the
only thing that could bring the
various races of humanity together
under one umbrella of peace, love
and harmony.
