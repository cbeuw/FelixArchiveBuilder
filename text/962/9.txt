Flying the flag
Showing we are not scared to get involved with ULU, Jonty Beavan
interviews Ben Hancock about his chances in the upcoming Sabbatical
elections
After all the fuss has died down
from Imperial's Sabbatical
elections, the walkway has been
cleared of ego-seeking publicity and
the losers have sniffled their way
back to anonymity, one IC student
will still be trying to fight for his
right for a sabbatical year.
Ben Hancock is a third year
Maths student and is trying to worm
his way through the mass of
beaucracy that is the University of
London students' Union (ULU)
elections. On Tuesday 16th March
he will face the assembled 'elected
representatives' of London
University and attempt to convince
them that he can do the job of Vice
President (Finance and Societies).
The last U L U officer who came
from Imperial is so shrouded in the
mists of time that Marc Samuels,
current U L U President could not
find an Imperial crest on the display
wall in his office. Trevor Phillips
one time IC, U L U and NUS
President, now part time presenter
for LWT and after dinner speaker,
is a more memorable figure from
IC to have been part of the larger
body of the University. A n
individual who Ben Hancock
dismissed as a 'professional student'
when I spoke to him.
As with all U L U posts the
process for getting elected is a little
obscure. Every election takes place
UGM
Friday 12th March, 1pm in
the Concert Hall (Union
Building, 2nd Floorl the
following posts are up for
grabs:
Academic Affairs Officer
ICCAG
Ents Chair
UGM Chair
Rag Chair
External Affairs Officer
Welfare Officer
Housing Officer
Post Grad Affairs Officer
2 Ordinary Members of

• BRING UNION C A R D S *
at General Union Council (GUC) of
U L U , in this body are the 'elected
representatives' from each college
of London University. After a brief
speech, and a series of questions the
meeting votes on which candidate
should be allowed the post. Unlike
the clamour of the elections just past
in Imperial, Joe student doesn't
even get a look in.
This obvious lack of student
expression in U L U is clearly a sore
point, because when I mentioned
the idea of campus wide ballots to
Ben, a stream of stock excuses
emerged. Expense, time for each
candidate to canvass 60,000
students and the fact that people are
not usually known outside their own
college were all wheeled out as
reasons for continuing the old
system. Fine, think I, but it's still
students' money that sabbaticals are
paid with.
Even with this original definition
of democracy, winning is not a
foregone conclusion. O f his
competitors for the post Ben is
dismissive, 'I can never remember
their names' he says describing a
list of accommodation officers from
U L U , Kings and Goldsmiths who
feel that they could fill the post
much better than he could. Is he
going to win? 'I'm quite confident..
I have better financial experience
than the rest' he replies.
Describing the actual job, Ben
goes into more detail: The 'normal
treasury things' and supporting
Societies in U L U as well as liaising
with the full time Entertainments
Manager, U L U employ to run the
bands and performances there. His
previous experience appears rather
narrow, having been heavily
involved in the Sailing Club and
little else. Ben does not see this as
a problem, as, he feels, the
impressive array of sailing
championships that he has
organised has given him a wide
range of experience in finance and
event management. Although about
the minutiae of the post, he is a little
uncertain, the same, no doubt, as
every person trying to enter a new
job.
What about the 'reexamination'
of Imperial's role in the University
of London that Sir Eric Ash,
Imperial's Rector announced in his
Commeration day speech last year?
Although he has not spoken to Sir
Eric yet, Ben does not regard it as
an immediate problem, but if
Imperial were to show signs of
moving out of the federation, 'I plan
to fight him' is the clear signal to
Sir Eric's successor.
Ben is convinced that Imperial
College students' Union and U L U
can coexist, saying that U L U
provides a different centre to
students in London and the chance
for Imperial students to mix with a
different group of people. 'It is
important that Imperial students
have a choice' he comments, and
plans to increase the profile of U L U
in Imperial if elected.
Is there a future in the University
PIC BY JOE BAGULEY
of London Union? Again the stock
answer is reeled out; U L U
represents all the small colleges in
London, places that would lose a
strong voice if U L U were not there
to defend them. Whether this will
be enough to keep U L U out of the
fate that is being prepared for the
NUS in the upcoming white paper
on Higher Education is not certain.
And what can he do for London
students if he gets the job? 'Provide
a well run facility at M a let street
showing the things they want to see
at a price that they can afford.'
Sounds like the promise of a well
meaning politician? Well, we can't
tell until we see him in action, and
thanks to the U L U voting scheme
few of us will get a say in that.
