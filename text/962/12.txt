A Time to Fast
Sarmad Qureshi takes a brief look at the Islamic month of Ramadan
Fasting was practised by many
prophets of the past including those
mentioned in the Old Testament—
Moses and Elijah are said to have
fasted continuously for 40 days, a
feat that was later repeated by Jesus,
who also recommended fasting as
an example and as a teaching.
Indeed, fasting is strictly practiced
in Judaism and the Jews fast on the
day of Atonement and the
Christians during the period of
Lent. These practices are observed
as a command from God, and in the
Quran God says
'O you who believe fasting has
been ordained for you as it was
ordained for those before you, so
that you may develop God-
consciousness' Quran 2:183
It is from this verse that the
muslims have been commanded to
fast. So in a continuation of the
messages that come before it the
Quran prescribes the month of
Ramadan for the muslims as the
period in which they fast from dawn
to dusk. 'Ramadan is the (month)
in which was sent down the Quran,
as a guide to mankind, also clear
(signs) for guidance andjudgement
(between right and wrong). So
everyone of you who is present (at
his home) during that month should
spend it in fasting...' Quran 2:185
It is for this reason that Ramadan
is considered as one of the holiest
months in Islam, and the month is
spent not only in fasting but also in
good deeds. The Quran can be
Jieard being recited from all corners
of the world, as muslims seek its
guidance and understanding. "This
is a Book of Guidance in which
there is no doubt. It isfor the God-
conscious' Quran 2:2
But the fast that is observed
during Ramadan is more than a
mechanical abstention from food
and drink. It also prohibits all
sexual relations between spouses,
during the period of fast, as well as
a strict observance of one's actions
and words and also encouraging
acts of charity and good deeds to
others.
What, however, is the wisdom
behind fasting? There are numerous
benefits that a person who fasts will
enjoy, encouraging the person's
character to progress, and those
who fast with intention and devotion
leave the month richer in spirit.
The act of fasting itself can
sometimes prove to be very
demanding. The month of Ramadan
may fall during the summer where
the long daylight hours can mean
that the fast lasts from 3am to
9.30pm. This can prove to be very
intensive especially as the period of
Ramadan progresses towards its
final days. Elsewhere in the world
Ramadan may fall during the hot
season, meaning having to bear
temperatures of 40 °C normally
unbearable, but made even more
difficult when you cannot drink or
eat. It is for this reason that the
person who fasts develops the
patience and willpower being able
to bear out his circumstances, with
the knowledge that his reward will
come at the time he breaks his fast,
and in the hereafter. "Those who
patiently persevere will truly receive
a reward without measure.' Quran
29:10.
Without the need for a check it
can be very easy to take things for
granted. It is all too easy to
succumb oneself to the desires of
this world, eating to and beyond
contentment with little care, or even
satisfying ones sexual desires. But
it is only when these avenues are
closed and you have to refrain from
these channels does one realise how
much one relies on them. This
lesson is to be learnt for all, as
hunger does not prejudice between
the rich and poor. This is all very
humbling as one then realises how
reliant he is and gives perspective
to one's mortality. But the lesson to
be learnt from this is not only
humility as restraint from that
which is permitted should also
develop restraint from these actions
that are discouraged.
The fast is also meant for one to
abstain from bad thoughts and
speech and to avert his eyes from
that which does not concern him.
So one has to devleop not only a
physical control of one's action but
of a mental control of one's
impulses and thoughts. Only when
this control is developed does one
realise how much he was led by his
tongue or eyes, how it insulted
others or the pain it caused. Then
do you realise how you can easily
become enslaved to your corrupt
side.
But fasting is not seen as a bruden
nor does it cause a radical change
in lifestyles as muslims carry on
living their normal lives during
Ramadan but being more vigilant of
their practices. The fasting is seen
as a blessing, which makes people
enrich their lives and being more
mindful of others. People are also
expected to practice the lessons of
self-restraint learnt after the month
has passed so that the benefit is
permanent and the rewards attained
immense.
The celebration of Ramadan in
muslim countries is a joyous
occasion and everyone contributes
to give to the feeling. In order to
preparation for life where
invaluable lessons are learnt and
practised. But Islam is not only
about self-control of the individual.
Muslims are encouraged to seek the
truth and to contribute to society by
being righteous and fair in all
dealings with people, and that is
where the challenge lies.
'The Believers, men and women,
are protectors one of another: they
enjoin what is just and forbid what
is evil: they observe regular
prayers, practice regular charity
and obey God and his Messenger.
On them will God pour his mercy:
for God is exalted in power, wise. '
Quran 9:71.
"Those who have faith and do
righteous deeds, they are the best
of creatures. Their reward is with
God: Gardens of Eternity, beneath
which rivers flow; they will dwell
therein forever.' Quran 98:7-8.

signify the begirining and end of the
fast, drums, cannon shots and even
alarm sirens are used . People
usually come together to open their
fasts in mosques or at their homes.
But overeating at the period of
opening and closing the fast is
discouraged as this would contradict
the principles of self-control learnt.
At the end of the month the feast of
Eid-ul-Fitr is celebrated and
muslims mankful for their blessings
gained, come together in large
numbers for prayers and then go out
to meet friends and relatives, but
again moderation being the
underlying element in the
festivities.
As can be seen the period of
fasting during Ramadan is a
T h e Holy Prophet has said: 'Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave'.
