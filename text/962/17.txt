Travellers W o r l d G u i d e s
Christopher Riley takes an
imaginary trip to Southeast Asia to
test the new travel guide boos from
'Travellers World Guide'.
So you've just arrived at the railway
station at Saigon, and you want a
cheap but safe hotel for the night.
You're new to Vietnam, the
currency, the people, the politics.
This is what your travel guides are
for - to guide you through the
nightmare of travel tribulations laid
to waylay you and wear you down
along the way.
The sweat is running down your
forehead, as you strain to stand up
in the sauna conditions, your
rucksack keeping you buoyant in
the platform crush. There are five
little men tugging you this way and,
that, as you fumble with your guide
book to check the hotel as they are
trying to entice you in to.
As with all guide books, space is
at a premium, and consequently the
writing is small and closely spaced.
Despite this the 'Thailand,
Indochina & Burma' handbook
(£13.95) runs to 816 pages, and the
hardback although only 11x19 cm,
weighs over 400 grams. Both are
important when you only have one
small bag to cram everything into
for maybe 12 months.
So how do these little white
guides stand up to seeking quick
information about obscure back
street markets, changing money
during the national holidays, or
buying a ticket for the weekly bus
to Can To on the Mekong Delta.
Too many guides on the market are
great on the history and the culture
of obscure, 'off the beaten track
places', but they don't give you
enough information to get there.
In contrast to many tame tour
guides, the travellers World Guides
are marketed as the definitive
handbook for the independent
traveller. The book begins with a
short practical introduction,
including a detailed section on
health care, followed by an
overview of the region. The book
is then divided into countries, each
of which begins with its geography,
history, culture, religion, politics
and economics, with even enough
detail to cover the local radio
frequencies for the BBC World
Service and the Voice of
America., .etc. After these
formalities are out of the way, the
travel nitty-gritty are covered,
starting with the capital then
covering the country region by
region.
But just how practical is this
information being a new and
independent traveller in town?
There are a few things to do before
seeing the sights and sounds. The
first order of the day is a ticket to
your next destination and a place to
lay your hat.
Hotels are divided into categories
A to E, A being the most expensive.
Accommodation is crammed into
one or two chunky paragraphs,
hotel names highlighted in bold.
The locations of most are shown on
comprehensive street maps, all with
a north arrow and scale bar - vital
when on foot. The problem is that
they are in Roman script - not very
helpful when you thrust the book at
a local in despair and beg to be
taken to the Sky Guesthouse in
Sukhothai New Town, central
Thailand. Two maps, one being in
the local language, would
occasionally be useful.
So you've got somewhere to stay
- next task a ticket away from
Saigon, from a rundown bus depot
somewhere across town you've
never been to and in a language you
can't speak. On this account, the
little white books offer a section on
'Transport to and from... by air,
train, bus, ferry, and ship' which
includes the main routes, times to
destinations, some costs and brief
visa information. This section is
even included for the smaller places
where it is most needed. The
concise 1 page vocabulary section
at the end of each country is just
enough to buy a ticket, but it could
be expanded to help with buying
food.
So at last we have which comes
close to the legendary Australia
based Lonely Planet series of guides
which assume you can get your
luggage off the carousal, and covers
everything from those that speak
English in Kumning bus station, to
bribing your way across the
Burmese border. The problem with
LPs is the time it takes for them to
come out, being updated every 2-3
years. TWGs aim to update their
books every year. But for my
money, the larger, clearer print of
the LPs still takes the edge. In
hardback, the TWGs will probably
last the milage better; but the
question remains - do you want
your trusty guide to look like it's
been to the ends of the world with
you or not?

This is a book which in a way seems
based upon Tutankhamun and his
curse which fell • upon the
archaeologists that discovered his
tomb. The plot is as simple as that.
Archaeologists digging in Kilgallan,
Ireland, discover what they initially
believe to be a tomb for one of the
ancient Celtic Kings. However as
they continue their studies, they find
that things are not as they originally
seemed. The tomb turns out to be
the prison of the Shee, the epitome
of evil which feasts on fear, horror,
violence and ultimately (as with any
other horror story) death -
preferably as horrific as possible.
The archaeologists inadvertently
help it to escape, before they realise
what they have done.
The book is well written, the
various characters being carefully
and cleverly woven into the plot,
giving the book life. The unwitting
hero is a journalistic photographer
which seemed a very unlikely
choice until you got deeper into the
story. The only problem with the
book, was the amount of gore - it
wasn't that it was too gruesome but
it wasn't anything new and it
became slightly repetitive, 'though
one wonders what kind of mind it
takes to think of these acts of
violence. Joe Donnelly does
introduce some of Ireland's history
to the reader along the way, which
is interesting and quietens it down
a bit. Not brilliant, but not bad!

Blood, guts, religous hypocrisy -
ah, now this is a book which makes
history interesting, nay, exciting; it
had me riveted. Its basically
hypothesising a link between the
ancient order of the Knights of the
Temple and modern day
Freemasonry, all very dry you may
think but it tells the sordid history
of the medieval hierarchy so
graphically you'll be held to each
page. It contains many short, almost
pythonesque, anecdotes like the
Catholic execution of cutting open
your stomach while still conscious
and slowly pulling out you
intestines. If it wasn't for the fact
that this was actually practised on
'heretics' it would be hilarious.
WARNING: if you're of a Catholic
disposition you may find some of
the book offensive. Why? Because
it exposes the outright hypocrisy
and evil that was the church. How
it condemned the Templars to
destruction just because of its greed
and desire for their extensive
property holdings and consequentiy
forced them to go underground only
to emerge centuries later as masons
- its all chronicled with breathtaking
plausability. Y o u ' l l also be
surprised at how many famous
figures of history were Masons:
from Christopher Wren to the
present Prince Philip. A jolly good
read.
