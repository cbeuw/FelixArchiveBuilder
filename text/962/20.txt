Divine W o r d s
This extraordinary production by
the Loose Change Company is the
British Premiere of Divine Words.
It is the story of a group of
somewhat repulsive villagers in
rural Galicia (in the north west of
Spain) in the twenties. A mentally
and physically disabled young man,
who is pulled around in a primitive
cart, is orphaned, and despite the
inconvenience of having to care for
such an invalid, his aunt and uncle
fight to look after him. Their
motives, however, are not altruistic.
It can easily be assumed, whilst
watching it, that the play is an attack
on the hypocrisy of a society who
proclaim to be strict Catholics, but
in fact, are rather selfish. However,
the author (Valle-Inclan) is simply
telling a story, and if anything, is
showing how human codes of
behaviour contradict our natural
instinct.
The acting is brilliant, and the
props, despite being simple,
enhance the atmosphere and make
the play a little more light-hearted.
The dialogue is carried out in an
Irish accent whose 'colouring and
lyricism seem to be the nearest
approximation to Galician.' This, I
think, is rather apt, although a
couple of characters are more
difficult to understand. The music,
too, is very well suited to the story.
Don't go and see it if you are
looking for a laugh or two. The
characters are, as I have said, rather
grotesque and the story could be
described as a little disturbing.
Otherwise, it has my wholehearted
recommendation.

Running D r e a m
The action of Running Dream takes
place simultaneously in Dominica
and England. Essentially, it is
concerned with the lives of three
sisters, Grace (Sherlina
Chamberlain), Clementine
(Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and
Bianca (Cathy Tyson), but to say
that it is their story is misleading for
that implies a kind of linear
progression from beginning to
middle to end. Trish Cooke's play
is a more truthful portrayal of life
and she resists the temptation to
impose any authorial, all-knowing
interpretation. However because of
the humour (uninhibited laughter
abounds) one leaves the theatre with
the sense of satisfaction that even
if life is not explicable it is funny.
Coupled with its wit, the strength
of the play is its music. It is almost
insulting to compare the music
present in Running Dream to that
of a musical which seems plagued
with the eternal question, how do
we start singing and yet appear to
be normal humans going about our
everyday life? Rather, the music
here seems to beat out the
subconscious, it is the heart and soul
of the play—something larger than
the play. In Running Dream we
have the perfect blend of bitter-
sweet humour, music and real life.

The M e r c h a n t Of V e n i c e
This was a joy to watch, not only
because I think that this is one of
Shakespeare's finest, but the cast
were right for the role. The part of
Antonio was played extremely well
- full marks to Paul Hatton. Others
worth mentioning are Andrew
McDonald (Shylock) and Sarah Ball
(Jessica). Somewhat shabby sets let
the atmosphere down a bit but this
is a fringe theatre after all. Do see
this play, it will be money well
spent.

Opera
The M i k a d o
Purists might feel surprised when
the curtain rises upon this
production of The Mikado; it is set
in an English country club, in the
1920s, and all the characters
(despite claims to be Japanese) are
Running Dream
totally English. Ah, but this is a
revival of the Jonathan Miller
production, and a delight to watch.
Richard Stuart has replaced Eric
Idle as Ko-Ko, and plays the part
with enormous enthusiasm: his
rendition of the (revised) Lord High
Executioner's song, 'I've got a litde
list', had the audience in stitches.
Nanki-Poo, sung by Barry Banks,
was a touch indistinct at times but
generally quite reasonable; Katisha,
sung by Anne Collins, was quite
superb, and won the audience's
hearts, with her ferocious stalking
about the stage and vicious delivery.
A marvellous production and pure
joy to watch,
Scarlet.
