Orlando
Orlando is a 'person' who lives for
400 years, initially as a man then
as a woman. The story begins in the
17th century, when he is charged
with entertaining Queen Elizabeth
I. We are then taken through the
chapters of his (and then her) life,
each a different period and theme
: 1600 - Death, 1612 -
Love, 1700 - Poetry, 1750 -
Politics, 1800 - Sex, etc.
culminating in a return to the
original location but in the present
day.
Though Orlando is about
ambiguous sexuality, the direction
is distinctly feminine, with each
shot a delicate framing of the central
character (Tilda Swinton) in
extrovert colour. This combined
with the simply constructed music
reminds one of Peter Greenaway's
films, but Sally Potter has added
such personal features as the
character occasionally addressing
the camera and an outrageous
flying, singing Jimmy Somerville
appearing at the end. Her intention
seems to be to empathise the
audience with Orlando, with
numerous silent close-up's
thorughout the film, which became
occasionally tedious, though I think
the desired effect was achieved. The
Orlando.
costumes and period sets where
delightful and almost a distraction
from the central theme, a great deal
of effort has obviously gone into
this production from actors and
crew alike. Whether this is an
accurate adaptation of Virginia
Woolfe's novel I cannot say but it
stands as an intelligent and original
work in it's own right. This is
where British cinema should be
heading.

Food
International Night
OK, here is the second instalment
of the Good Food Column. This
week we review the biggest and best
event IC stages - International Nite.
But us being food types will review
the Food Fair only, leaving the
cultural thing to those cultural kinda
people!
There were dishes originating
from 11 different countries, giving
International Nite the uniqueness
not achieved at any other time in IC.
This year professional chefs were
called in to cook, and by all
accounts their efforts were well
appreciated.
We cannot list the actual dishes
that were to be tried, as there were
just too many and if we do forgive
the spelling, including veggie and
non-veggie food. And we would
like to say now that if we do not
mention some food it does not mean
that it was not good, it just means
that we could only try a limited
amount of food! Also all the food
we tried we liked, and by asking
others it seems that all the food was
SUPERB, so don't get offended if
your food has not been mentioned.
Vic first tried some Italian,
served by three very unlikely
Italians! It was a spinach pancake
thing, and was wonderful even
more so as Vic had never tried it
before. Nainish went and accosted
the Iranian people and was
subsequently served a huge helping
of sweetened rice (no idea of what
went into it) with peas and chicken.
The Latin American food was a
must to try and Vic got a plateful
of Brazilian rice (notice how the
staple food is rice for so many
cultures?) and some crab dish (Crab
Moqueca?). The Turkish stall gave
us some stewed lamb curry, cooked
the Turkish way and to sweeten our
palates there was a plateful of
Turkish Delight. Nainish found the
Nigerian food to be a completely
new experience with a huge choice
of dishes, from which he chose the
black bean stew, fried plantains and
some bread fruit, and now strongly
recommends the M D H to cook
more African food!
Going on, the Spanish stall had
some crispy chicken which we
wanted to try, but by now both of
us were too full to try any more!
The Indian stall ran out of food
before we even had a chance to get
there, which speaks volumes for the
attracting power of the food and
people serving it! The Malaysian
and Singaporean (joint) stall was
attracting great attention at the end
where the deserts were creating a
huge commotion - this coloured
jelly (Ayam Golek?), some sponge
cake with coconut and fruit.
Summing up the food at the Fair
was more authentic than most
restaurants that either of us have
been to, because it was all prepared
in a rush and in bulk like is done
with a big family in a crowded
kitchen, with no time for the chefs
to do their nouvelle cuisine stuff.
The atmosphere in the M D H was
truly brilliant, with all the cultures
and foods mixing so well together,
and giving many people the chance
to try taste sensations they would
never have otherwise.
Congratulations must go to the
OSC for the time and effort gone
into organising this, especially Nina
Bhanap who managed to cajole and
comfort 10 touchy chefs throughout
the day well enough for them to
produce some amazing food.
(No marks awarded as the
experience only happens once a
year!)
