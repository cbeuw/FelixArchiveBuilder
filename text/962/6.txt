Banned leaflet
In last week's issue of Felix,
Mark Richards of I C U
Conservative Society wrote a
disparaging letter which derided the
Islamic Society's sincere attempts
to open a dialogue concerning the
problems of the Middle East, and
Islam as the ideological solution to
these problems and all problems
world-wide. M r Richards sneered
at the concept of Islam being a
complete ideology. I find it strange
that someone, who seems to have
no real knowledge of Islam, can
cheerfully dismiss it without even
examining it. This does not strike
me as being a terribly open-minded
or enlightened attitude.
Islam, the Ideology
An ideology is an intellectual
doctrine from which a system
emanates. This system should
provide comprehensive solutions
for people's problems and a method
for satisfying their needs. A n
ideology, therefore, should not only
have an intellectual basis, it should
also provide mechanisms for
practical implementation of the
aforementioned doctrine. Islam,
like Capitalism and Communism,
has these mechanisms. Islam has
very detailed political, economic,
judicial, educational and social
systems. These systems are all
embodied in the Islamic State which
is responsible for their
implementation.
The Islamic State
The current Muslim states do not
represent Islam in the ideological
sense. They are secular states
whose populations happen to be
Muslims and whose laws sometimes
have a vague cultural affinity with
Islam. So Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq
etc, are definitely NOT Islamic
States and any criticism of Islam
using such countries as examples is
totally invalid. To being with, these
countries do not even adopt the
Islamic political system; this is the
Caliphate (Khilafah) which was
destroyed with British complicity in
1924. There are many groups of
dedicated Muslims across the world
involved in re-establishing the
proper Islamic State. What would
an Islamic State be like though?
Judicial System
The Islamic judicial system is often
criticised on the basis that some of
its punishments, such as the
amputation of the hand of the thief,
are barbaric. But is not the mindless
murder of two year old Jamie
Bulger barbaric? This may be a
farely rare incident at the moment,
but for how long? Remember
Rachel Nicole, Julie Dart or any of
Felix 962
the hundreds that didn't make it
onto Crime Watch? In Britain,
crime is now reaching endemic
proportions:
There is now a burglary ever 24
seconds. A car crime every 21
seconds. A rape every 2.5 hours.
We live in a sick society where
men, women and children cannot
walk the streets without fear of
being robbed or assaulted. Even the
horses in the Home Counties cannot
graze freely without some
disgusting pervert carving up their
private parts? Yet smug critics have
the audacity to ridicule Islamic
solutions when their own
institutions have addressed these
problems with monumental
incompetence and empty rhetoric.
Islam belives that the belief of a
person in the after-life, and a
consequent accountability for
actions in this life, will motivate a
person to refrain from committing
crime. Islam also recognises that
human beings are inherently weak
and therefore open to temptation; so
Islam provides a deterrent. The
deterrent principle is after all
applied by the West to justify its
nuclear arms and there is no reason
why the analogy cannot be extended
to a societal level.
Economic System
Britain is currendy in the grip of the
worst recession since the 1930s. As
a result of this litde downturn, 1200
businesses have been going under
every week. The high street banks
have not exactly helped matters
with their overcharging, untimely
repossessions and seizure of
business assets. These actions have
been well documented in all
sections of the press. The banks
point out that other large
corporations have also made a
substantial profit during the
recession; and anyway they are not
a charity but a business whose duty
is towards the shareholders. Other
large companies, however, are not
in the position of controlling the
medium of exchange in this
country. Neither do these same
companies make their profits from
displacing 75,000 people from their
homes or making their businesses
collapse. When faced with the
choice of commitment to their
customers or submission to their
shareholders, the banks always
choose their shareholders. So there
will always be a conflict of interests
as long as banks are in private
hands.
The Islamic State would have
only one bank; the Government
Bank. This bank would be free from
any obligations to greedy
shareholders so it could get on with
the job of helping businesses to
prosper, thus creating a successful
economy. But what about the
massive fluctuations in interest
rates? State ownership of the
banking system cannot remedy that,
surely? Actually, that is the really
good bit; There are currently a lot
of people calling for a cut in interest
rates to improve the
competitiveness of British industry.
Under the Islamic economic system
rates are always low: 0%
permanently, to be precise. So
businesses will save billions in
interest repayments, and this cash
can be invested in the creation of
jobs and prosperity.
Conclusion
I have so far only briefly mentioned
the judicial and economic systems
of Islam since economics and law
and order are .both pretty topical
issues. Regarding the issue of
British foreign policy in the Middle
East, it is well documented that
Britain has always exercised
hegemony in the region: the R A F
gassing of Kurds, the Sykes-Picot
agreement, the Balfour Declaration,
the destruction of the Caliphate, the
creation of artificial countries such
as Iraq, Jordan or Syria, the
precipitation of the Suez Crisis, the
massive arms deals with Saddam
Hussein; these are but a few
examples of the British
establishment's arrogant and evil
involvement in the wanton
destruction of people's lives. I
strongly urge M r Richards to
participate in an open debate about
these matters or to make a public
apology for his slander against
Islam and Muslims and withdraw
his ill-informed and puerile
comments. If he really does believe
in market forces, democracy,
British foreign policy and the caring
Conservative philosophy, let him
defend it intellectually and publicly.
