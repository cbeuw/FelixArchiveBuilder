T h e Indigo G i r l s — T & C
The Indigo Girls played a stunning
two hour set to a packed Town and
Country Club last Friday night.
Emily and Amy were accompanied
by a nearly all female band
including, I am pleased to say, a
cellist and a violinist. Their new
material is so good that they had
little need to resort to old favourites.
The new album 'Rites of Passage'
(Epic 471 363 4) is a true pleasure.
Their sound is a little changed
live. A powerful blend of acoustic,
ringing guitars and close vocal
harmony. With just enough folk
influence to keep your spine tingling
and enough country to keep your
toes a tappin'. On top of this are two
of the most powerful and pure
female voices around today with
tunes and lyrics to lift you up to
higher places.
If this wasn't enough—it was—
the concert closed with a guest
appearance of the legendary Joan
Baez. If you haven't heard of her
your parents will have all her
albums! Their three voices together
were matched in ability—a
complement to the musical skill of
the Indigo Girls. Simply superb.
This is a band for the spiritually
impoverished. A seriously spiritual
experience. Life force recharge
City.

Sloan for the uninitiated are a US
guitar band recendy signed to M C A
via Geffen. Simply sound choons or
as a friend of mine would put it
'tude. Smart, smart melodic indie
that leaps and jumps around out of
the banal indie guitar fashion, but
so loosely like floppy hair.
Hyperhead are loud and chunky,
but I've seen more activity in a
packed tin of sardines than this
place. Live exuberance surpassed
only by Nitzer Ebb, bass is so
overwhelming it seeps under your
feet, grabs your ankles and pulls,
leaving your teeth chattering
uncontrollably. Percussionist and
singer in a wild, unrestrained frenzy
scorching traces on the psyche; only
gripe is 3 guitar wanker types doing
nothing but pose. Still, it was
Smashing.
Sloan were overpowered tonight,
but the subtleties made their
statement. Hyperhead were in
overdrive and only a fool would've
walked out.
MC4 were there, Huggy Bear
supposedly were there, but where
were you?

C o n w a y Hall
Perpetually changing instruments
and anger tie these 'riot grrrl' bands
together. Arguably Jack of all
trades and master of none, but what
is undeniably important is the
underlying attitude.
Avocado Baby were a little shy
for their own good, but top marks
for the bloke who was dress-ed up.
As a band they really weren't
together, and were in fact shite.
Itchy Poo potted their president,
and despite only two numbers
showed a lot of potential.
Enraged and incensed were
Bikini Kill, stomping through but
somehow didn't have the
spontaneity despite the tons of
aggression. Better than the previous
acts by a long way, but not as good
as was about to come.
At last, Huggy Bear got up on
stage; technical prowess not their
forte, but their confrontational
audacity kicks you in the face. They
don't want to be lumped in with
punk, but they are. The original
punk was partly a backlash against
60's flowerpower that had been
dragged into the early 70's (escapist
vs confrontational attitude).
Similarly Huggy Bear are repressed
all right, all the bands were, but
what differentiates this lot is that the
repression has fermented anger,
which rips chunks out of conformity
in magnanimous proportions. Just
feel the voice of society muted by
the anger of youth and never forget
insanity breeds genius. I must admit
I was a cynic before, but am now
definitely converted; I must also be
some sort of warped pervert, angry
women turn me on!
Bikini Kill and Huggy Bear were
the only two bands worth going to
see, they could both definitely incite
a riot, but a revolution? Time will
tell.

T h e Tragically Hip, T h e 4 of
U s , G h o s t of an A m e r i c a n
A i r m a n — T & C
It was a night for the vocalist to strut
their wares in front of faceless and
pretty dour bands. First into the
limelight was Ghosts. Dodge
McKay; high on the Spinal Trap
rating. Looking something like
Morrissey and acting like a squirrel
on acid, the stage was his world.
Jumping up and down, into the
crowd and most memorably
performing a handstand, motionless
for a minute, he mirrored the
intensive nature of their music.
Energetically loud. Unfortunately
that was about it, loud. The golden
egg in their basket was 'Freakshow'
from their EP '4'. Roll up and see
Dodge the hyperactive squirrel—
it's got a ring to it.
The 4 Of Us inititally appeared
to be a illframed bunch. There were
five of them and their lighting
looked like a reject from the Gary
Glitter farewell tour. Nevertheless
they managed to rise above it for at
least half the time. The psychedelic
swirling tracks had a bite to them,
whilst the more conventional stuff
like 'Sensual Thing' was going
nowhere; rather like the two
guitarists who didn't move except
to breathe and then none too often.
Again it was the lead singer, one
Brendan Murphy who carried the
day. Drooping black fringe and
evidence of an acne ridden past
gave note of a man ready for rock
'n' roll stardom.
Then it was time for the 'Hip' as
the initiated call them. (To be
initiated you had to be Canadian and
talk lie something out of Wayne's
World.)
'Hi, Winnipeg.' 'Hi Vancouver.'
'What are you doing over here,
dude?' 'Hey, I work for I B M
(garth)' 'Yer dude, my dad was
president of IBM, Canada.' 'No
Way.' 'Way.' Party on Wayne,
here's a stick of dynamite!
Thankfully The Hip weren't too
long before corning on. Swiftly they
broke into their new album 'Fully
Completely'. The liveness breathed
colour into an album which had
been rather 2D on first hearing.
Tracks like 'At the 100th Meridian'
and 'Pigeon Camera' were more
accessible, dragging you into a wall
of rhythmic motion. Even weaker
songs like 'Lionized' and '50
Mission Cap' started to crack a
whip like they wanted to go
someplace.
Frontman Gord Downie was an
interesting mix of Henry Rollins
and Robin Williams. Facially it was
Williams; pulling faces and
screwing up his eyes but under it all
a concentrated energy all dressed up
and ready to play.
Throughout, all the initiated
continued to jump merrily around,
and then start a feud with the T&C
security. By the end about 20
embryonic stage-divers had
attempted to plunge. Most being
treated to the 40 second trip marked
'EXIT'. Still the show went on and
finally ended with a trimphant
'Eldorado'.
For a band renowned for their
live performances, they had
impressed and I hadn't understood
a word God had said; especially the
bit about his Grandmother and a
nuclear submarine. Tragic.
