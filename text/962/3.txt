Cat's Eyes
Red N o s e Day IV
I'm not going to start moaning
about charity in general and how it
would be unnecessary if all wealth
was distributed evenly, since this
matter is often brought up by
somebody else and it is boring to
read or listen to anyway. It seems
that perpetrators of this argument
are banging their heads against a
brick wall because the situation has
got worse; more charity events such
as Comic Relief and benefit
concerts are occurring. These are
to the general delight of the public,
since the concerts are often
excellent and Comic Relief has
never caused me to do anything but
laugh. But I feel that ideas are very
thin on the ground though, as far as
Red Nose Day is concerned. The
Red Nose-type object has become
the symbol of Comic Relief since
it started in 1987; first the noses
were small, then they were bigger,
then they developed hands and now
it has metamorphosised into a
tomato. What will they do for Red
Nose Day V in 1995?
Rachel Basset
I think I owe her one whopping
great apology for last weeks
repetition of what I see now was a
particularly cruel joke that was
possibly out of order. This action
is not instigated by that letter from
Sarah Lee (RCSU A A O BITCH),
but by reports from people at the
hustings that she defended me. It
seems then that I owe her a thank-
you as well. (I can't believe I'm
writing this!)

How much publicity has been given
to this film!!? I think everyone
would agree: too bloody much. I
have not seen it yet because despite
Denzil Washington's alleged
sparkling performance, the identity
of the director has put me off. Spike
Lee's previous efforts, although
entertaining and possibly very close
to real life, always focus on the
Felix 962
pairi, anguish, torment blah, blah,
blah, that the white community has
and is inflicting on the black
community. I go to the cinema,
mainly to be entertained, but also
to learn a few things. I don't go to
experience a guilt trip, as many of
my white friends have, and then
leave with a feeling that all the
hatred among the black community
is my fault. I remember seeing or
reading an interview with Spike Lee
in which he said this was not the
aim of this film. Things don't
always turn out the way we want
them to. Being a member of the film
industry, I am surprised he hasn't
learn this lesson yet.
S a b b a t i c a l Elections
After denying that I would not
mention the election to several
students in Felix, I find myself
going back on my word. All I want
to say is congratualations to all
winners and I hope they do a damn
good job next year.

Cleaning up on Islam International Thanks
Dear Jonty,
First let me make one thing very
clear about Islam. Islam—as we
stressed a number of times
before—is not a mere religion—
which is commonly known to tackle
the spiritual aspect of Man only—
but indeed a full and complete way
of life, since it would not be right
or wise for God to create Man
without providing him with the
rules and guidance necessary for
him to run his own affairs in a just
and fair way.
And history bears witness to this
fact when it was implemented
wholly and fully.
It is obvious from last week's Beit
Back article, that its author found
a book on Islam written by a good
old orientalist repeating the same
good old false, biased,
misinterpreted allegations.
Islam is the last religion sent
down from God to the whole of
Mankind and not a certain nation or
tribe and is similar to all the
messages that came before it. It was
brought down through Angel
Gabriel (peace be upon him), and
I consider it foolish to assert a
nationality to any of God's Angels
(peace be upon them).
As for the claims made on the
Quran, indeed they are not but
claims short of any substantial proof
or evidence 'And if you are in doubt
as to what we have revealed to our
servant then produce a chapter like
it and call your witnesses or helpers
besides God, if you are tmthful. But
if you cannot, and of surety will
not, then fear the fire whose fuel is
men and stones which prepared for
those who reject faith' Quran
2:22-23.
As for the slaughtering of non-
muslims you must be either joking
or lying. Who is slaughtering
whom. It was and still is that the
Muslims are the ones who are being
oppressed, persecuted and
butchered and this is being done
throughout history up until today as
in Bosnia and Palestine—so do not
then come and clubtly blame
Muslims for defending their lives
and security.
'God forbids you not with regards
to those who fight you not for your
faith nor drive you out of your
homes from dealing kindly and
justly with them, for God loves
those who are just. God only
forbids you with regard to those
who fight for your faith and drive
you out of your homes and support
others in driving you out if such as
turn to them in their circumstances
that do wrong'
Quran 60:8-9
And I challenge those who
ignorantly accuses Muslims of
forcing osiers on becoming
Muslims, to produce for us an
authentic sound historical record of
such claim. In fact the large number
of people today all over the world
Dear Jonty,
International Night '93 took place
last Friday and I write this letter to
thank all those who participated in
or contributed to the event.
In particular, I would like to
thank Harpreet for running a superb
Cultural Show, Nina for weaving
her way around the impossible
obstacles of environmental and
health regulations in order to get the
Food Fair organised and Nainish
for his immense support in all areas
esepcailly the finances and the live
band.
Thank you Marcus for the
famous logo design, Jan for the
who are coming back to their
natural way of life—Islam—which
proves otherwise.
My sincere advice to the author
of that article and to people like him
is to acquire the decency, when
disagreeing with others—to put
forward their argument in a manner
that would rise above comments of
mockery and insult, so if we were
not fortunate enough to agree with
each other, we would at least be
successful in achieving mutual
respect and understanding.
Finally, I feel it would be
appropriate to end my letter with an
extract from Annie Besant's book
disco, Tooba for the posters and
tickets, Shehzad for the sponsorship
and Aarzoo, Zahra and Nee for
coordinating the show and
rehearsals. I should also like to
mention Duniya, Sunil, Giha,
Stanley and Boon.
International Night '93 was
organised to celebrate the many
cultures and nationalities
represented at College. I am sure
that most people who came learnt
something new and enjoyed the
event.
Sincerely,
Yen Yang Lim, Chairman OSC.
'The Life and Teachings of
Muhammad':
It is impossible for anyone who
studies the life and character of the
great Prophet of Arabia, who
knows how he taught and how he
lived, to feel anything but reverence
for that mightly Prophet, one of the
great messengers of the Supreme.
And although in what I put to you
I shall say many things which may
be familiar to many, yet I myself
feel whenever I re-read them, a new
way of admiration, a new sense of
reverence for that mighty Arabian
teacher.
Yours Fahad El-Adawi.
