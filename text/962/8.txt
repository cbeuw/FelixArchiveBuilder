What would they do if they had their time again? Four sabbaticals
voice their wishes.
PRESIDENT
The Presidents job cannot be
summed up in 300 words or
probably even in print. In many
ways it is what you make of it and
most of my work is self inflicted.
The few administrative jobs which
I do have are delegated to the
permanent staff, because they will
If I were here next year I would like
to see a change in areas of
responsibility of the various
officers. In many cases there is
confusion as to who is supposed to
be doing what. I am responsible for
clubs & societies and the HonSec
is responsible for overseas students,
so who takes care of overseas
student societies? Further, it always
strikes me as absurd that the Deputy
President has to arrange security for
events coordinated by the HonSec
HON SEC
This may appear to be something of
a tired old cliche" but it's painfully
true. There are only 24 hours in a
day. Whether you like it or not you
inevitably end up prioritising your
time. Things that at the start of the
year you'd had the best of intentions
to put right, to devote endless hours
of effort to, become,
unintentionally, rusty heaps on the
road side.
I've always tried to work by the
ethic 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'.
Rag has seen very little of me. I
don't think they've needed me. M y
FELIX EDITOR
Most of the job of Felix Editor and
Print Unit Manager is running fast
to just keep standing still. With the
need to produce and organise a
weekly magazine, a job that in the
media industry is usually broken up
between a team of people, precious
little time is left for planning and
improving Felix.
On top of this, working and being
responsible for the machinery of the
Print Unit makes the job even more
difficult. If I had my time again, I
would concentrate on two things:
bo a better job of them.
I have to be all things to all
(wo)men. I have to deal with every
customer in an individual, be they
a student, member of my staff,
member of college staff and so on.
The type of queries I get are the
ones that nobody else knows the
answer to and, on the whole,
and arranged by Ents. If they were
all done by the same person, life
would be a lot simpler.
Union sabbaticals are a wasted
resource. There is an awful lot of
work currently undertaken by
sabbaticals that need not be. The
one thing that I think I have spent
most time on this year is security.
It has been satisfying to shake the
Union security operation into some
semblance of order, but it only
needs to be overseen, and not run
absense doesn't seem to have
affected them because they've
raised incredible amounts of money
this year. They ain't broke and they
don't need fixing. I'd like Rag to
think that if they wanted any help
then I was around to give it. I hope
that the OSC Commitee feel the
same way.
If I had my time again then I'd
try to spend more time with the
student societies. This is though
something of a false promise but I
feel obliged to make it.
What I set out to do from the start
Firstly organising the structure of
the Print Unit and Felix so the
people who work here understand
the organisation better. Secondly,
to spend much more time at the
beginning of the year, dragging
people into Felix so it is much more
representative of Imperial College.
The unfortunate fact is that while
the Union has bucked up its ideas
and joined the 1990's, Felix has
not. Felix needs to get more
students writing for the magazine
so, pressure is taken off those who
require delegation, although if I just
did that I would be a poor President.
I identify and solve problems. This
may mean setting up a major project
or simply having a few words with
the appropriate people. At the end
of the day it all takes time and that
is one thing I seem to have none of.
I have a year left to do in my
by a sabbatical.
When you consider that between
a third and half the DP's time is
taken up with external work i.e.
representation on College
committees, the time he/she is able
to devote to internal affairs seems
all the more precious.
I would like to see the Deputy
President in more of a management
role, making sure the financial side
of the Union runs smoothly, and
keeps changing with the times.
of my year was to promote the
Union as a social centre. The
refurbishment of the bar was a great
help and I'd now like to think that
students, particularly first years,
always think of the Union as the
first place to go on a night out. If
I had another year then I'd push the
Union even harder. There's still too
many people who don't know
what's going on. You can never
spend enough on advertising; I hope
my successor doesn't let this slide.
When I set out my manifesto I
purposely didn't fill it with false
spend a great deal of time and
energy putting together sections of
our magazine at the moment.
Another section of the Felix job
is DOBSON, very few at Imperial
will even know what this stands for.
DOBSON is a directory listing all
the student newspapers in the
country, and is organised through
the Felix Office. It has enormous
potential, maybe expanding to
cover other countries, other student
media, and possibly sending student
newspapers over electronic mail.

department but when I do look for
a job I would like one that is similar
to my job now, if perhaps better
payed. In short I love the job but
it is not good for the health, mental
or physical.
All the best,
Chris.
Rick Bilby
Responsibilities for the day-to-day
running of the Union should be
devolved to other Union officers or
permanent staff.
I have instigated changes to make
fairer the distribution of Union
funds, but I believe that we could
get rid of a lot of the red tape and
make the system run more
efficiently. I know which areas need
the most attention, and I hope my
successor will carry on where I
leave off at the end of July

promises. I am always angered by
candidates whose pledges are as
solid as the foundations of castles
in Spain. If you talk bullshit then
you eventually end up with some of
it on your face. I knew what I could
achieve in the time I had and so I'm
fairly content.
A Sabattical year will always be
frustrating because it'stoo short. By
the time you've learnt the ropes it's
the twelfth round and you're out.
Perhaps it's time for a new member
of staff?

Co-operation over all the
Universities of the U K is immensely
powerful. A network of student
media could exist without the
endemic problems of the NUS and
would mean we are taken a great
deal more seriously than at present.
I hope my successor realises this
and continues the work of the
previous Felix Editor who set up
DOBSON.
