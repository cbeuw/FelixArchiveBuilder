L:D$|jted, the suggestion that a u n i -
v e r s i t y independent of the Stats, i s
both p r a c t i c a l and desirable i s put
forward and discussed by Professor
Ferns,of Birmingham University.
Necessity
Professor Ferns gives many,
reasons for. the neecesit,..- of such •
an i n s t i t u t i o n : that i t i s s o c i a l l y

peo- '
pie on t h e i r ov/n can meet a coKcuin-
ity; need with no assistance from
(Mm. state.*,'' ; that i t would help
to meet the present demand f o r u n i -
versity places: ( 3 5 , - ' of those with
:the nessesary "qualifications- can-
not f i n d places).
Perhaps the most scathing att-
ack on the present system, is- the
suggestion that thepresent system
produces, degrees rather than peo-
* pie "'"who are educated to use know-
pledge i n t h e i r work,and have the.
self-confidence and judgement which
comes from, knowing, what they are
doing...'1
General Education
There: i s room, according 'to- •
the author, for courses which aim
at a more, general education than
the present specialised programmes.
In M s opinion "many of B r i t a i n ' s
problems stem from the poor quality jj,
and inadequate- education of the adm"
ministrat ors, organisers and trans-
mitters of knowledge who are not
equal to bringing to- bear i n the
p r a c t i c a l context of l i f e the achi-
evements of the. e l i t e of pure scie-
nce and the arts."
AS a f i n a l reason the author
feels a need to 11
preserve and stress. .
