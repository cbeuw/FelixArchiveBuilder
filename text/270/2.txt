' This term we kick off with a few
duplicated sheets cf paper , stuck
together with a staple and with a
mammoth External Affairs Committee
bumf-sheet bunged on the back.
)x The ne:;c issue w i l l appear a fort-
night today and w i l l be printed by
West London Offset i n a similar
fashion as i n the previous several
years.
Then.; on Thursday February 6,
things change. W
e say goodbye to
cheap offset l i t h o and hello to
s l i g h t l y more expensive letterpress.
This change of printing process
w i l l give us better reproduction of
photographsj no smudges or smears
or crooked paragraphs~in fact, a
me'hi clearer, more attractive paper.
The f." .?st is;',U3 with our new
printers w i l l also contain a careers
supplement which should make inter-
etroin;. reading t or a l l t h i r d years
with f i n a l s coning up i n June.
Cf course, this improved quality
means we spend more money. This
means ve have less financial elbow-
room, Which brings us to another
subject* , ,
We stopped selling this paper
at our Southside sales t i n last term
because M theft, For one issue,98$
of the southside copies were unpaid
for. i n factj throughout the college

Each year the students of I Ch
choose one charityto support.
This year we are helping the Nat-
ional' Council for the Unmarried
Mother and Her Child, after very
careful consideration of i t s
merit., ana our a b i l i t y to collect
for i t . This i s the only cha,_.+.•"
of i t s kind, and without our f i n -
ancial support would probably have
to close down.
We realised that i t would not
commend i t s e l f to a l l sections of
the general public, but we have
been greatly dismayed by the man-
ner of some people «ho have refus-
ed to contribute. We feel chat i t
should be possible for them to
refuse without either insulting
the charity or disheartening the
collectors*
