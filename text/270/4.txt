Bernard Sunley House,Imperial
College's second Student House i n
Evelyn Gardens .was occupied at the
beginning of this term after a. delay
of three months*
Warden of the house i s Ian Wells
who i s now engaged i n postgraduate
work i n Metallurgy*
The house , close by Mining
House which was opened ar the start
of the academic year, i s a group of
5 adjacent houses which have been
converted into one unit and paid for
by the B ernard Sunley Foundation.
The chaos prevalent when the
previous house was opened was not
repeated i n Bernard Sunley House*
However, after unpacking their beds
the residents found that such things
as e l e c t r i c kettles and shaving
mirrors for the communal sink were
s t i l l a l l i n the Warden's office.
Thanks to a report by Dave
Harris.Warden of Mining House,
examining the finances, rents are
down by 1 0 / - per week. Residents i n
Mining House get this back-dated to
1st Octobero The occupants are now
paying £3 per week for a single room;
£2-10s for a double, and £2 for a
treble.
Room heating i s by an e l e c t r i c
f i r e through a meter, while radiators
provide free central heating except
in the basement* Lighting i s also
on a meter system, as i n Mining House
,but there are hopes that lighting
w i l l be free i n the next block.
I t i s hoped that the summer
w i l l see the completion of 3 more
houses i n Evelyn Gardemss near to
the others. The search for Wardens
w i l l be beginning soon.

Mo More Parking
In the l a s t issue i t was stated
that an extra 10 parking places had
been gained by over-allocation. We
have been asked to point out that
the relevent stickers are temporary
and can be repealed i f the experimeitt
does not work. Moreover, they have
already been allocated, and no further
applications for places should be
made this year©
