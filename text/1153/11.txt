The State of the Union
By Natasha Newton, Imperial College Union President
H i , Mystic M e g here, trying t o pre-
dict this w e e k ' s c o m p l i a n t a n d
l a u n c h a preemptive response -
didn't d o t o o b a d last w e e k .
O k , so thanks for all the f e e d b a c k .
A p p a r e n t l y I a m t o o a n a l . Sorry. I
didn't w a n t t o try t o b e funny
b e c a u s e I k n e w I w o u l d not b e , still
I will attempt to be m o r e r e l a x e d , in
fact even n o w I a m lying d o w n lis-
tening t o w h a l e music. (See, said I
c o u l d n ' t b e funny.) A l s o w e a r e
l o o k i n g into t h e n u m b e r s o f non-
student staff e m p l o y e d i n t h e
U n i o n .
Sorry a g a i n t o all those w h o a g a i n
t h o u g h t I w a s a b a d p e r s o n o v e r
the a l l e g e d events with t h e sports
hall. To b e honest w e a r e not the
p r o b l e m t h e p r o b l e m is t h e l o c a l
residents. W e w a n t the sports h a l l ,
with times a n d a r e a s w e c a n use.
They d o not w a n t the sports hall at
all. At the last p l a n n i n g m e e t i n g the
"in f a v o u r ' petition w h i c h the U n i o n
h e l p e d t o put together w a s i g n o r e d
for the sake of a very s m a l l n u m b e r
of letters o f c o m p l a i n t s f r o m t h e
locals.
I have c o p i e d a letter to Felix w h i c h
I sent off t o W a r n e r Brothers C i n e -
mas this week. I d o n ' t k n o w if they'll
print it b e c a u s e it is quite l o n g .
Essentially the story is thus: W a r n e r s
were a f r a i d o f f r a u d . They thought
the N U S c o u l d help the'm. They
n o w a c c e p t only N U S cards. This is
silly. N U S Universities c a n c h o s e t o
have the s t a n d a r d c a r d o r a d d the
l o g o to their o w n cards, so the c i n -
e m a is turning a w a y all o f us non-
N U S universities a n d lots o f N U S
o n e s. I will k e e p y o u posted a s t o
the reply I get t o m y letter t o t h e
H e a d o f O p e r a t i o n s at W a r n e r
Brothers. In the m e a n time, a n y o n e
w h o simply must g o t o W a r n e r a n d
n o w h e r e else, c a n g e t a n I S A A C
c a r d f r o m STA o n the walkway.
W O T N O T is u p a n d r u n n i n g , e m a i l

T h e G r e a t e r L o n d o n Authority a n d
L o n d o n M a y o r elections a r e o n
their way. To b e a b l e t o vote y o u
n e e d t o register. Simply cut out the
f o r m a n d d r o p it b a c k to the U n i o n
office. If y o u a r e not sure a b o u t vot-
ing it is best t o register a n y w a y a s
the opportunity t o d o so will shrink
a s time passes.
A n d finally, w h a t will it take to get a
truce between m e d i c s a n d n o n .
(Not that all are fighting, but all are
affected.) M y interest lies solely with
the Students of Imperial. N o t of o n e
d e p a r t m e n t o r race o r g e n d e r o r
any other division w h i c h c o u l d b e
m a d e . W e have 1 0 months until w e
m e r g e with W y e C o l l e g e . W h a t
i m a g e we will present to t h e m ? Will
those 1 0 0 0 students b e w e l c o m e d
into a hostile, prejudiced e n v i r o n -
ment w h e r e the last m e r g e r looks
set t o r u m b l e o n like C a t h o l i c s V

arrive their c o u r s e s a n d lives will b e
affected a s w e r e the lives o f those
w h o e n d u r e d the I C S M merger. W e
have the experience t o m a k e t h e m
feel at h o m e , t o understand h o w
they will feel. A t the m o m e n t they
must f e a r stepping into I C a s s o l -
diers f e a r e d g o i n g 'over the t o p ' .
Inter-CCU rivalry is a l o n g s t a n d i n g
g o o d f u n tradition, but is m o r e
mascots than m a s s a c r e . D a r e I s u g -
gest that it's time t o wipe the slate

dent for b e i n g c r a p at her job a n d

T h a n k s t o a l l o f y o u w h o have
