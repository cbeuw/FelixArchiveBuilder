Toaster
Six Million Dollar Goat
(Toaster Music)
Loads of energy, s o m e
t h e a t r i c a l i d e a s a n d
s o m e quite innovative
guitar mixed with a
classic early 9 0 ' s p o p -
rock f o u n d a t i o n . This is
quite a stylish single,
boyish a n d full of ideas.
The Clint Boon Experience
White No Sugar
(Artful)
Yes it is a n experience. A sort of
cheeky/classy o n e . This b l o k e , right,
talking o n t o p of this music, right,
a n d blokes s h o u t i n g H E Y in the
b a c k g r o u n d . Right. T h e music's sort
of rock (right) meets b i g b a n d (right)
meets easy listening. Clint B o o n H A S
the funk, a n d the m a n is not afraid to
use every type of flavour to give his
music style. Loads of little bits of
scratch, voices s a m p l e s a n d skits to
spice up his stuff.
Cousteau
The Last Good Day Of The Year
(Global Warming)
This chunk of siow, d i m , beautiful
m o o d is this weeks winner. The music
is b a s e d o n a n o l d i d e a , quite 5 0 ' s in
fact. But the b a n d d o e s a w o n d e r f u l
job at mixing n e w ideas in to it, with-
out disturbing the b a l a n c e of i t ' s
inhereted predictability. Cosy, c o m -
forting a n d mystical. To me i t ' s Tin-
dersticks versus Easy Listening. This
h a s n ' t left my stereo all week. Look
out f o r the oppurtunity to experience
this live.
Planet Perfecto
Bullet In The Gun
(Perfecto)
H o u s e , in fact quite
b o g - s t a n d a r d p r o d u c -
tion h o u s e . Paul O a k -
e n f o l d is o n e of the
n a m e s b e h i n d this o n e
a n d his fans s h o u l d not
be d i s a p p o i n t e d . The
first version is a bit t o o
Eurovision f o r m e , but it
gets k i c k i n ' in the Satur-
day M i x . Think early Sat
night as your getting
ready. Sure to get y o u
d i s c o b u n n i e s in the
m o o d f o r a g o o d night.

Divine
Lately
(Red Ant)
Divine w o n ' t let y o u
d o w n baby. Sweet a n d
sour soul with her very
e m o t i o n a l v o i c e , icing
the c a k e . T h e g i r l ' s g o t
it right. The remixes
bring m o r e street into
the music which is o t h -
e r w i s e quite h o m e l y .
Simple but effective.
ID
The Mutton Birds
As Close As This
(Shhhl)
G o o d m e l o d i c rock f r o m these
Kiwis. D o w n to earth well written
a n d well structured music. At best
beautiful. A catchy tune a n d s o m e
rather s a d d e n i n g ones. If y o u like
classic b a n d s such as U 2 a n d R E M
then this o n e is f o r y o u .
James
Just Like Fred Astaire
(Mercury)
J a m e s have got Brian E n o in their
t e a m this time, A N D S i n e a d O ' C o n -
nor. The b a n d s initial talent + o n e
of the greatest producers of all times
+ o n e of the most f a m o u s voices of
today = Boys d o n e well, I reckon.
Personally I like them best w h e n they
are at their most tender sweet, but
that describes m e m o r e than t h e m .
These musical pop-rock tunes, are
sure to m a k i n g their way into your
radio as y o u read these lines.
Lyte Funkie Ones (LFO)
Summergirls
(Arista)
A m e r i c a n , a c o u s t i c
funk. Very easy g o i n g
white rap... In fact i t ' s
so easy g o i n g y o u
c o u l d n ' t really call it
rap, with m o r e Beck-
flavour than ever hip
hop. In i t ' s m i n i m a l -
ism it is a little bit thin.
Y o u c o u l d definitely
study to this.
