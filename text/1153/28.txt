Jagged Alliance (PC)
So h o w d i d y o u lot s p e n d the s u m m e r ? M o n e y - e a r n i n g , CV-loving work
experience, character b u i l d i n g travel o r head-start study? H o w a b o u t
l e a d i n g a t e a m of bad-ass mercenaries against the dictatorship of a small
3rd w o r l d country? Y e a h , that's w h a t I g o t u p t o . But only virtually o f
course. N o C V b r o w n i e points there then...
J a g g e d A l l i a n c e 2 is actually the third instalment i n a series o f g a m e s
where the g a m e p l a y b a l a n c e o f strategic warfare a n d resource m a n a g e -
ment is s o fine e v e n N e w t o n w o u l d b e i m p r e s s e d . Q u e e n D i a d r i a n n a
holds a n icy grip o n A r u l c o , with every last s c r a p o f m o n e y that is c l a w e d
out o f the country's o r e mines f e e d i n g her fetishes. Your job? Take h e r
out a n d reinstate the rightful ruler, but to get to her you'll have t o w i p e o u t
the army first, all with only a small b a n d of carefully selected meres. C a r e -
fully, I say, b e c a u s e in this g a m e personality conflicts a r e w i d e s p r e a d
a m o n g s t the varied staff y o u c a n c h o o s e f r o m . You'll a l s o need to m a k e
sure that your selection o f hired killers is b r o a d e n o u g h t o include skilled
m e c h a n i c s , explosive experts, m e d i c s a n d natural 'eaders a s well a s the
obligatory m a r k s m e n .
W h i l e s q u a d selection (and more) is c o n d u c t e d via a virtual l a p t o p , mer-
cenary tasks are a s s i g n e d using a m a p screen a n d u p o n entering territo-
ry o c c u p i e d by the e n e m y play switches to a n isometric view for battle.
E a c h o f y o u r well-animated mercenaries c a n b e m a d e to r u n , c r a w l ,
c r o u c h a n d jump a l l with a n easy t o use interface. Battles a r e executed
with a c o m b i n a t i o n o f real-time m o v e m e n t a n d , u p o n sighting a f o e , turn-
b a s e d c o m b a t . This system works very well f o r strategic warfare without
the a n n o y i n g hitch o f o l d e r turn-based g a m e s where o n e spent a g e s m o v -
ing e a c h t e a m m e m b e r bit-by-bit across the sector l o o k i n g for the last b a d
guys t o kill. C o m b a t is fairly e n g r o s s i n g with countless g u n s a v a i l a b l e (all
with realistic physics), plus the ability t o l o b g r e n a d e s , throw knives, use
b a z o o k a s , a n d modify y o u r inventory with items f o u n d a l o n g the way.
Blowing s o m e o n e ' s h e a d off with a shotgun o r drilling t h e m in the chest
with M A C - 1 0 burst fire is most satisfying, but y o u m a y find it a n n o y i n g
w h e n a w o u n d e d adversary pulls off blindingly a c c u r a t e shots while your
a c e sniper misses a sitter...
O v e r a l l , unimpressive g r a p h i c s , weird (but amusing) dialect a n d lack of
environment interactivity prevent this g a m e f r o m attaining dizzy-heights
status, but don't let that deter y o u b e c a u s e all things c o n s i d e r e d this is a
well-put together c a m p a i g n that is certainly worth fighting.

Tiberian Sun (PC)
Tiberian Sun is the kind of g a m e that grabs your attention a n d doesn't let
g o for a l o n g , long time. D r a w i n g o n their eleven years of experience writ-
ing real time strategy g a m e s , W e s t w o o d have p r o d u c e d the most detailed
a n d tactical RTS t o date.
W h a t m a k e s the g a m e quite s o addictive is its complexity. Every strategy
for victory has a counter strategy, every unit has a use a n d every attack has
to be intricately p l a n n e d if it is to s u c c e e d . D u r i n g s o m e of. my massive
four-hour long multiplayer matches I have f o u n d myself c o o r d i n a t i n g
simultaneous s u b t e r r a n e a n , g r o u n d a n d a e r i a l attacks, while at the s a m e
time d o d g i n g missiles fired at m y base a n d trying t o c o o r d i n a t e artillery
support with a h u m a n player ally. T S d o e s not a d d a n y really n e w ideas to
the genre - given the d e v e l o p m e n t time I w o u l d have expected s o m e t h i n g
a bit m o r e novel - but all the o l d C o m m a n d a n d C o n q u e r ideas have
been taken out of the c u p b o a r d , dusted a n d p o l i s h e d until they shine like
new.
The graphics engine is a d e q u a t e , a l t h o u g h s o m e 3 d - h a r d w a r e a c c e l e r a -
tion w o u l d have been nice. T h e m a p s are a l s o n o w properly 3 D a n d c o m -
pletely d e f o r m a b l e . The controls have b e e n i m p r o v e d by the a d d i t i o n of
waypoint system, a n d the routing f o r units h a s b e e n c o m p l e t e l y rewritten,
so that units c a n find their w a y across the m a p without constant babysit-
ting f r o m the player. However, I can't help thinking that the two m o u s e
button control system used in g a m e s like Starcraft a n d Total A n n i h i l a t i o n
(in which y o u left click t o select units a n d right click t o issue orders) is f a r
superior to the left-click only system used by all the C o m m a n d a n d C o n -
q u e r g a m e s . The most important part of the g a m e , however, is the units.
In a lot o f other RTS g a m e s the best strategy f o r victory w a s always t o build
as m a n y heavy tanks as possible a n d c h a r g e into the enemy's base with
all guns blazing. But in Tiberian S u n , this just isn't possible. Assaults o n
the e n e m y base require p l a n n i n g , timing a n d a well-mixed set o f units to
work.
The single player c a m p a i g n s are varied a n d at times c h a l l e n g i n g , but this
g a m e is mainly a i m e d at the multiplayer market. If you've g o t a local net-
work o r a decent Internet c o n n e c t i o n then be p r e p a r e d to have s o m e real
fun. If not, then the c o m p u t e r controlled o p p o n e n t s a r e certainly harder
to beat than in past C & C incarnations, but are still t o o unresponsive a n d
unintelligent t o pose m u c h o f a c h a l l e n g e after a f e w g a m e s . Either way,
I w o u l d still advise any real time strategy player t o buy this.
