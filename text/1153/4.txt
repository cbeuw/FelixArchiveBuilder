The bestselling author of Fermat's Last T h e o r e m
has a f e w surprises u p his sleeve. F o r starters,
despite have written two massively p o p u l a r books
(his latest work, The Code Book, shot straight into
the t o p ten in it's first week), secured a Physics P h D
from C a m b r i d g e a n d picked u p several awards for
his work with the B B C (where he directed the
acclaimed documentary o n the famously inexplica-
ble Theroem), he's actually a graduate of Imperial
C o l l e g e . S o , Simon Singh, over to you...
Are you happy you chose Imperial?
Looking back, I guess I a m . Like a lot of people
here, I applied to O x b r i d g e , a n d in retrospect I
think it was a definitely g o o d f o r m e to have been
rejected - I'm just not g o o d at talking to strangers
or working in g r o u p s . . .
N o n e t h e l e s s , it's very strange t o c o m e
back...for my sins I w a s R C S President for a year in
the late eighties, a n d long before they were famous
I b o o k e d people like Paul Merton a n d Julian Clary
for the Ents Lounge [smiles a n d gazes into the m i d -
dle distance].
So why did you leave IC and opt for Cambridge?
After a time you have to move o n . I read about o n e
leading biochemistry department which w o u l d only
accept students from other unis for PhD's. Stipulat-
ing it like that might be g o i n g a bit far, but nonethe-
less it's a very sensible philosophy - after four years
here I needed a break a n d a change. Anyway, there
were only a handful of universities in the country
offering the course I w a s looking for, a n d C a m -
bridge was probably the best...
How did you get into media?
I realised while I w a s at C a m b r i d g e that I wasn't
going to b e a great physicist, a n d I started looking
at how to get a job in the m e d i a . Essentially, you just
have to keep submitting material to as many p e o -
ple as you possibly c a n , a n d eventually s o m e o n e
will take a n interest a n d publish something you've
done...it worked for m e a n d I eventually landed a
job with the B B C , m a k i n g segments for Tomorrow's
World a n d Horizon.
How did you move into writing?
I met s o m e o n e at lunch o n e d a y at the B B C w h o
was writing a book, a n d w e started talking about
the program w a s making...I said that it w a s a
shame that I h a d to cut s o m u c h out of the d o c u -
mentary to keep it d o w n to a n hour (a o n e hour
documentary is about 7 0 0 0 words) - so she sug-
gested that I write a b o o k (which gives you about
100 0 0 0 words t o play with) s o that I could tell the
story properly.
So what's next?
I'd like t o think that I've g o t another couple of
books in m e , but I certainly wouldn't guarantee it.
M y life has been a series of happy accidents, a n d I
could easily b u m p into s o m e o n e next week a n d
h e a d off in a completely different direction....
But would you ever want to go back to physics?
After ten years away, it's far t o o late to g o back to
physics.. .sometimes I think I'd like to g o back, but
after you've spent a day with the m a n w h o solved
Fermat's Last Theorem o r a morning with Stephen
H a w k i n g , you realise there are people operating o n
a n entirely different level to you...besides, I knew
was never going to be a great physicist, so it was n o
great loss
Who do you target your books at?
Essentially, I try to write for anyone with c
intelligence.
.. .so what's Ihe new book about?
The C o d e Book is basically about the hi
development of codes from ancient civ
sations to the latest developments a n d
s p e c u l a t i o n a b o u t ' u n b r e a k a b l e '
c o d e s . . . W h e n I was writing Fermat's
Last Theorem I started to learn about
codes, a n d there's a section in
That book ThaT I really wanted
to develop o n , but it didn't
really fit into the main story.
N o w , however, by giving it it's
own b o o k I c a n g o into every
aspect of codes a n d codebreaking
in as much detail as I want to.
Essentially, there a r e three
main threads: Firstly, it's o n e third a
history b o o k [examples a n d
details]... secondly it's about the
maths a n d science behind encryp-
tion a n d cracking [examples]...and
the final third is a look at the future
a n d the possibility of developing
those 'unbreakable' codes with the
advent of massive c o m p u t i n g
power available to all.
Finally, what's the contest in the back of the
book about?
It's just a bit of fun really - a chance to put what the
b o o k teaches you into practice, a n d possibly win
something along the way. It is interesting t o see the
range of people w h o solve the puzzles, though - the
first correct solution to the first level was a speech
therapist, the second was broken first by a philoso-
pher, the third by a brain therapist, a n d the fourth
was cracked by a 1 5 year o l d girl...[the latest
