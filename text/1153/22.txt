Election
O K so this a n o t h e r o n e of those films set in a n A m e r i c a n high s c h o o l , but it is not a b o u t o n e or. all o f the
f o l l o w i n g : kids " c o m i n g o f a g e " , perverted h u m o u r (see A m e r i c a n Pie), a r e m a k e o f D a n g e r o u s Liaisons
(see C r u e l Intentions), c o o l a n d d e t a c h e d reflection (see Rushmore), o r a " G o s h , I wish I w a s a different
p e r s o n w h e n I w a s in high s c h o o l ! " (see N e v e r b e e n kissed), etc. A s y o u p r o b a b l y k n o w , there has b e e n a
big rush o f teen films recently. A l t h o u g h not all o f them c a n b e d i s m i s s e d . R u s h m o r e w a s a fine film, a n d
likewise C r u e l Intentions.
'Election' is set in a small town s o m e w h e r e in the United States of A m e r i c a . W e f o l l o w the d e v e l o p m e n t s
t h r o u g h a small n u m b e r of characters as they e a c h tell us bits of the story. To tell y o u that the film is a b o u t
a presidential election at a s c h o o l d o e s not d o the film justice. It's all in the detail, a n d the detail is f a n -
tastic: h u m o r o u s , d a r k , a n d observant.
The central character is teacher M r McAllister (Matthew Broderick) w h o is the most p o p u l a r a n d driven
t e a c h e r in his s c h o o l . H e loves his job a n d has b e e n married t o his wife for. nine years. T h e s e c o n d m a i n
character is student Tracy Flick (Reese W i t h e r s p o o n ) . Flick is the only child o f h e r d e v o t e d m o t h e r a n d
"works very h a r d " at anything she d o e s but that d o e s not stop at h e r studies. H e r m o t h e r is the type of per-
s o n w h o writes to successful w o m e n t o find out a b o u t the reasons f o r their success a n d if they have any
a d v i c e f o r her daughter. H a v i n g served o n every m a j o r s c h o o l c o m m i t t e e , Tracy p r e p a r e d t o stand u n c h a l -
l e n g e d f o r president. T h e other t w o characters a r e Paul a n d Tammy Metzler, a brother a n d sister w h o a r e
in the s a m e year as Tracy at the s c h o o l .
M r McAllister, wary of e n c o u r a g i n g the over-achieving Tracy, talks a not-too-smart Paul into the election.
T h e result is satire with a relaxed t o u c h . T h e film leaves n o o n e u n t o u c h e d in terms of its satire: the c a r e -
less, the selfish, a n d even the g o o d . Ultimately it is a very believable film a n d this h a s t o d o with the great
p e r f o r m a n c e s of the actors. M a t t h e w Broderick played a brilliant M r McAllister. Reese W i t h e r s p o o n ' s Tracy
Flick a n d the others were a l s o excellent. To c o n c l u d e : g o o d film, worth w a t c h i n g .

G o o d luck t o o n e a n d a l l .
