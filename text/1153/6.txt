Summer
Two weeks into term, behind on your coursework and wishing you'd done more in the vacation?
W e started striking c a m p o n c e the sun w a s u p . T h e previous d a y ' s rain w a s
nowhere to b e s e e n , a l t h o u g h long white c l o u d s were stretched.across the
sky, p i n n e d motionless against the .morning. This bothered m e . W h a t a l s o
bothered m e w a s the state o f my h e a d , fuzzy a n d c o n f u s e d from the wine
a n d excesses of the previous night. I stumbled to o u r pre-arranged clearing
a n d f o u n d a seat in the l o n g d a m p grass. W h e r e the hell w a s I? O n a hill
near Traunkirchen in t h e m i d d l e o f Austria w o u l d b e the g e o g r a p h e r ' s
answer - in a place o f tranquillity with s o m e of my best friends w o u l d b e
mine. Paul, J o n a n d I h a d b e e n travelling f o r a b o u t ten days. W e ' d met u p
with J a n in V i l l a c h , by s o m e miracle of o r g a n i s a t i o n , a n d h a d spent the last
two days searching f o r a p l a c e like this, right o n the line.
W h e n w a s it? Shortly after 1 O a m , W e d n e s d a y 11 th August. The sun w a s
darting between c l o u d s in a will-you-won't-you kind of way. T h e light h a d
b e c o m e very blue a n d metallic. Birds were starting t o roost. T h e valley w a s
beginning to d a r k e n . T h e n suddenly it a p p e a r e d - the sun, totally o b s c u r e d
by the m o o n , ringed by fluffy white c l o u d s . T h e c o r o n a w a s magnificent,
bleeding purple a n d pink, yellow, green a n d blue o n t o the c l o u d s . Two m i n -
utes s e e m e d to last a day, yet at the s a m e time c a m e a n d went in a n instant.
It went very dark - Venus a p p e a r e d f r o m b e h i n d a m o u n t a i n . Crickets turned
a peaceful g l a d e into a roar of s c r e e c h i n g . I s h u d d e r e d a n d l o o k e d a r o u n d
for my shirt.
The m o m e n t p a s s e d , a n d w e returned t o p a c k u p o u r things, but it
stayed with m e f o r the rest of the day. W e were to part at the train station -
Jon a n d Paul were off to V i e n n a , while J a n a n d myself attempted to get to
Slovenia within a day. W a l k i n g d o w n t h e m o u n t a i n t o the village I felt pret-
ty g o o d a b o u t life, travelling a n d solar eclipses, but o n e question still b o t h -
ered m e ; what exactly w a s I d o i n g there?
Why go inter-railing?
There a r e as m a n y reasons to g o travelling round Europe as there a r e Swiss
railway c o m p a n i e s . If y o u think that c a v e exploration in M o r o c c o w o u l d b e
a t a d t o o m u c h effort, but y o u d o n ' t really w a n t t o s p e n d the s u m m e r
w o r k i n g in the p u b a g a i n , then p e r h a p s Europe is calling y o u
So what if it's c o o l t o explore T h a i l a n d a n d sorted t o
spend the s u m m e r in Ibiza? Inter-railing is re
atively c h e a p a n d hassle free, while
at the s a m e time a l l o w i n g y o u t o
improve that character profile o n y o u r
C V M o s t o f a l l , t h o u g h , it provides a
great c h a n c e to see t h e continent, have
a l a u g h , g e t a t a n , a n d m a y b e learn
something o n the way. W h y c h o o s e trains
instead o f buses? B e c a u s e they a r e a l o t
more reliable, a n d n o t m u c h m o r e expensive
if you're travelling f o r m o r e than 2 o r 3 weeks.
Besides, y o u try getting f r o m Florence to A m s t e r d a m in o n e night o n a bus.
Thirty days inter-railing c a n cost n o m o r e than £ 1 0 0 0 , subject to drink-
ing habits a n d e x c h a n g e rates. A o n e month all z o n e inter-rail pass is cur-
rently a b o u t £ 2 6 0 ; allow £10-15 a night f o r a c c o m m o d a t i o n in hostels, £5-
1 0 a d a y f o r f o o d a n d suchlike, a n d a r o u n d £ 5 0 f o r getting i n a n d o u t o f
Britain a n d insurance, a n d you're a b o u t there. This d o e s , of course, a s s u m e
you have a rucsac a n d the o b v i o u s e q u i p m e n t (see below).
If all this s o u n d s a little b e l o w your n o r m a l daily budget, then consider
c a m p i n g . T h e only trouble is that this c a n b e s o m e w h a t tricky in a n d a r o u n d
cities, as well as quite d e m a n d i n g f o r weeks o n e n d . If y o u ' d rather not take
a tent then use overnight trains (supplements will rarely cost as m u c h as h o s -
tels), o r sleep in fields occasionally. D o not sleep i n t h e park in Freiburg -
you m a y be w o k e n u p by s o m e rather friendly g e n t l e m e n . M y other w a y of
saving m o n e y is to s p e n d most of the time in Eastern E u r o p e - in Z a g r e b I
got a 2 0 " pizza f o r a r o u n d £ 4 , a n d beer w a s only over £1 in the most tourist
p e r m e a t e d regions.
And so it begins
Funnily e n o u g h , I h a d n o intention o f g o i n g travelling d u r i n g the s u m m e r
until half w a y through June. S o m e o n e suggested w e meet u p f o r the eclipse
a n d , since C o r n w a l l already l o o k e d like being a n over-hyped marketing
s c a m , I a g r e e d . A g r o u p f r o m the caving club were g o i n g t o b e in Slovenia,
s o Austria w a s the logical v e nue . Then s o m e o n e m e n t i o n e d g o i n g t o Italy
afterwards. I c o m m e n t e d that Florence h a d g o o d i c e c r e a m , a n d s o m e art.
S o m e o n e else suggested getting w r e c k e d in the Black Forest f o r a day.
Six weeks a n d o n e union h a n d b o o k later w e were o n the g o o d o l d P & O
cross c h a n n e l ferry o n a clear, blue a n d rather nice s u m m e r ' s m o r n i n g . O f
course, travelling r o u n d Europe is all a b o u t experiences, seeing n e w places
a n d enjoying the finer points o f E u r o p e a n cultures, s o by the first night w e
were safely e m b e d d e d in A m s t e r d a m . A n y o n e w h o read Felix last year c a n
guess h o w the next f e w days were spent. W e eventually left, suitably refu-
elled, o n the overnight train t o M u n i c h . There is o n e g o l d e n rule with
overnight trains; reserve a seat in a d v a n c e . If, like us, y o u don't realise
you're leaving until t w o hours before the train g o e s , then there's a silver
rule; get o n the train long before it departs, g r a b a c o m p a r t m e n t , a n d try t o
l o o k like the last person in the w o r l d a. respectable E U citizen w o u l d
want t o share space with. Taking your shoes off is a g o o d start.
After a brief diversion t o t h e Black Forest n e a r

we stayed at a vast a n d

w o u l d never have g o n e to otherwise.
Stopping off at Salzburg for a night o r two, w e then h e a d e d to Villach
to meet o u r c o m p a n i o n . The journey f r o m Salzburg to Villach has to o n e of
the most pleasant in E u r o p e , a s the train winds its w a y t h r o u g h stereotypi-
cal A l p i n e mountains a n d valleys. W e actually d i d the trip twice in o n e day,
returning to Salzburg before setting out to Traunkirchen.
After the eclipse a succession o f unfortunate experiences taught m e a n
important lesson; don't tempt fate. J a n a n d I d e c i d e d t o c a m p a n d , refus-

Dreams
Ed Sexton looks back on a summer gone and decides whether Inter-railing is all it's cracked-up to be
ing f o r a 4 a m train. Bored with the station a m b i e n c e , w e h e a d e d o u t o f
town a n d u p a w o o d e d hill f o r the night. J a n sat d o w n under a tree explain-
ing "I can't b e bothered t o put the tent u p - we'll b e fine in the o p e n " . C u e
storm half a n h o u r later.
Turning East
After the storm incident I parted f r o m m y c o m p a n i o n (coincidence, I assure
you) a n d h e a d e d to Slovenia's c a p i t a l , Ljubljana. W h e t h e r o r not to travel
o n your o w n is a question m a n y w o u l d b e inter-railers ask themselves. T h e
advantages a r e o b v i o u s ; y o u d o w h a t y o u want, w h e n y o u want. Londoners
tend to live o n t o p of e a c h other, often literally, a n d there is a lot of truth in
the f a b l e d "finding yourself" travelling experience. If y o u want to meet
p e o p l e , y o u will - I b u m p e d into s o m e o n e w h o w a s in Linstead
with m e o n t h e overnight train f r o m Z a g r e b t o Split.
Then a g a i n , it c a n b e tiresome d o i n g every-
thing yourself; at least if there's t w o of
you the organisational bur-
d e n decreases. -«A<8
T h e
because of the nudist b e a c h a t o n e e n d . Being a rather b o r i n g g r a d u a t e , I
spent most of the d a y at the other e n d where it w a s s o m e w h a t quieter. T h e
island is fairly unspoilt, with a b a r selling c o l d beer f o r £1 a half litre the only
c o m m e r c e a l l o w e d .
After a b o u t a w e e k of s u n , little s a n d a n d n o sex, d u r i n g which time I
met Paul in Z a g r e b , w e h e a d e d to Pula a n d thence to Florence. This in itself
p r o v e d to be tricky, partially b e c a u s e I i g n o r e d t h e tempting fate rule, a n d
partially because C r o a t i a n bus c o m p a n i e s a r e confusing a n d f a r too n u m e r -
ous. In the e n d w e m a n a g e d to get f r o m Pula to Florence by using o n e bus
a n d three trains, arriving a mere six minutes
after o u r s c h e d u l e d meeting time. Flo-
rence, of c o u r s e , involved pizza, art, ice-
c r e a m , art, d o d g y Italian beer, a n d more
art. Train h o p p i n g to A m s t e r d a m over a
Thursday night I spent the last few days
before m y pass r a n o u t in H o l l a n d ,
recovering f r o m travel fatigue a n d
s p e n d i n g s o m e time with a close
friend.
B a l k a n s
a r e , p u t simply,
b e a u t i f u l . T h e scen er y is
beautiful, endless forested hills with
f a i r y t a l e hilltop castles, a n d s o m e of the best
coastline in E u r o p e . Ljubljana is a n expanse o f white
stone a n d quiet backstreets, with a d a s h of m o d e r n glass m o n o -
lith thrown i n . Z a g r e b ' s bars stream endlessly onto steep c o b b l e d alley
ways. T h e p e o p l e a r e beautiful, f r o m the intense g o o d looks of the y o u n g
to the dignified w i s d o m of the elderly - a n d they a r e the friendliest folk I've
ever met. I went c l u b b i n g in both Ljubljana a n d Z a g r e b , a n d the sheer
enthusiasm a n d joy that the c r o w d possessed at having the f r e e d o m t o
d a n c e until d a w n is s o m e t h i n g I've never seen i n a L o n d o n club.-
The remnants of the break u p of Yugoslavia r e m a i n , of course. I met a
m a n in Ljubljana w h o used to live in B o s n i a before the war. N o w , under the
Dayton a c c o r d , his village Serb controlled a n d he dares not g o back. H e
lives, with his wife a n d t w o c h i l d r e n , in o n e r o o m in a friend's house in the
city. H e told m e " f o r s o l o n g I w a s bitter, n o w I just forgive... but I can't g o
back. I have no. money. M a y b e next year I c a n ' get s o m e l a n d , s o m e
m o n e y . . . m a y b e . " I f o u n d myself w o n d e r i n g whether it w a s merely c o i n c i -
d e n c e that a p e o p l e w h o have e n d u r e d s o m u c h suffering in recent years
have such strength a n d love o f life as that which I e n c o u n t e r e d .
...and then the beach
You can't be a cultural observer all the time a n d , after a few days in Ljubl-
jana a n d Z a g r e b , I h e a d e d d o w n the C r o a t i a n coast to Dubrovnik. Surpris-
ingly u n d a m a g e d by the siege seven years a g o , w h e n Serbian forces encir-
cled the town o n lan d a n d s e a , the o l d city is a tourist trap, but a w o n d e r -
ful o n e . A p a r t f r o m the beautiful m a r b l e d streets a n d m a z e o f alley ways,
the water in this part o f the Adriatic is extremely c l e a n a n d clear, a n d very
inviting at a r o u n d 1 8 d e g r e e s .
I spent a d a y o n the island of L o k r u m , originally f a m o u s f o r being where
Richard t h e Lionheart w a s s u p p o s e d l y s h i p w r e c k e d , n o w m o r e visited
What to take and when to go
The tendency a m o n g inexperienced travellers (like me) is t o take t o o
m u c h . A rucsac is the obvious starting point, a n d sleeping b a g c o m e s in a
close s e c o n d , a l t h o u g h most hostels will lend y o u sheets a n d blankets f o r a
modest fee. M o n e y belts seem popular, a l t h o u g h I can't stand them - your
wallet in a buttoned o r z i p p e d pocket is almost as effective. O n the clothes
front never underestimate the p o w e r of T-shirts, a n d don't pretend y o u won't
need to d o a n y laundry. A c h e a p watch with a light a n d a decent a l a r m is
a g o o d i d e a - there's nothing worse than g o i n g f r o m M u n i c h to Salzburg
a n d w a k i n g u p in V i e n n a . The s t a n d a r d first a i d kit is a must (plasters, anti-
septic, etc), a n d puratabs will definitely help y o u t o a v o i d water problems
(except f o r the taste). E l 1 1 forms (available f r o m the post office if y o u
haven't already g o t one), p h o t o c o p i e s of your passport a n d driving licence
a n d s o m e travel insurance a r e all useful in case of emergencies. O b v i o u s -
ly if. you're g o i n g s o m e w h e r e hot sun lotion a n d insect repellent s h o u l d b e
a d d e d t o that list. Travellers cheques a r e a handy w a y t o carry money,
a l t h o u g h the:rise of A T M s almost everywhere in Europe is rapidly m a k i n g
them redundant; S o m e loose currency is also useful - finding the bank is
rarely your first priority o n entering a n e w city.
For f o o d a n d drink, a water bottle is a must, a n d plastic o r metal cut-
lery a n d / o r bowls a r e a l s o useful. Travel pillows c a n seriously increase c o m -
fort o n long journeys, a l t h o u g h a rolled u p shirt is a l m o s t a s pleasant. A
daysack to put this stuff in is a g o o d i d e a , particularly if y o u like to have a
g u i d e b o o k o n y o u at all times. There's not m u c h to c h o o s e between Rough
G u i d e a n d Lonely Planet - both list non-existent restaurants (and, worse still,
hostels), quote incorrect prices a n d a r e fairly arbitrary in w h a t they cover.
Rough G u i d e tends t o tell y o u more a b o u t a p l a c e a n d its history, while fail-
ing t o provide a n y decent m a p s , w h e r e a s Lonely Planet will list the local
s w i m m i n g p o o l ' s p h o n e n u m b e r but not tell y o u w h o built the cathedral.
Take your pick.
A few more items which a r e invaluable a n d c a n b e carried at all times:
Penknife, string, those small screwdrivers y o u get in C h r i s t m a s crackers,
small torch, a lighter a n d , of m o r e q u e s t i o n a b l e usefulness, a c o m p a s s .
O b v i o u s l y don't forget n o t e b o o k s , pens, w a l k m a n s , c a m e r a s , etc, a n d the
p h o n e n u m b e r o f your girlfriend / boyfriend / m o t h e r / lawyer (delete as
applicable). Beware o f using m o b i l e p h o n e s a b r o a d - I r a n u p £ 1 0 0 bill in
2 8 days using it only for text m e s s a g e s a n d a b o u t five calls h o m e . A n d don't
forget your inter-rail pass, p u r c h a s a b l e f r o m STA.
