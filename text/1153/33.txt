Shock - IC Fencers lose Ladies score six times
Anew year, a new s e a s o n , a n d -
due to g r a d u a t i o n - a mostly
new t e a m . . . The all-conquering IC
t e a m was prepared to start its first
match against the, until now, fairly
m e d i o c r e U C L t e a m . H o w e v e r
rumours were a b o u n d a b o u t the
strength of their t e a m this year
which proved to be mostly true as
their t e a m h a d a few g o o d new
arrivals. First up was the sabre with
J o h n " K e e p your meat a w a y from
m e , " D a v e " J a w s " a n d M o " C a p -
tain A n i m a l " leading out the IC
t e a m to a 2-7 defeat in the s a b r e . . .
only o n e fight e a c h for M e a t a n d
A n i m a l (the result of a night out
before at a Faithless concert!).
Fairly d i s a p p o i n t i n g , but with
the foil up next there was a h o p e of
a c o m e b a c k - with D a v e " D o n ' t tell
my supervisor I was pissed a n d lying
in bed all m o r n i n g " D a v i d g e , Chris
"Paul S i m o n . . . " a n d the great Jaws
- w h o was n o w in desperate need of
a g o o d physio. D a v e D. p r o d u c e d
the g o o d s a n d fencing superbly,
particularly considering the loss of
his trusted blade in the first fight a n d
the fact that he h a d to w e a r a l a m e
that m a d e him look like a boy w e a r -
ing his d a d ' s suit. O n e victory e a c h
for Paul S i m o n a n d Jaws meant that
we w o n the foil 5 - 4 , with M e a t
being substituted in for the last fight.
Epee was o u r final w e a p o n a n d
we n e e d e d to win this 7 - 2 to take
the m a t c h . O u r hopes rested with
o u r n e w f o u n d epeeist Ricardo "the
Italian Stallion" w h o fought well a n d
s h o w e d his pedigree by taking two
fights arid narrowly l o s i n g o n e
against a very experienced fencer.
The other two epeeists were D a v e
D. a n d Jaws (with A n i m a l s u b b i n g
himself in a desperate attempt to
m a k e a n impact - it failed), w h o
only m a n a g e d to pick up o n e fight
between them. The final score: IC
1 0 - 17 U C L
This was a disappointing first
m a t c h , as we simply lack the fenc-
ing experience that we used to
have.
