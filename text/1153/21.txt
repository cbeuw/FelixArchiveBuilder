Tuesdays @ La Scandale
Drink till you're drop dead gorgeous
A recent survey of Imperial students w h o had failed their degrees revealed
that the top three reasons for failure were lack of work, financial hardship
a n d La Scandale. O n e of the main problems of writing a review about La
Scandale is that the few w h o live to tell the tale of what lies behind those
classy N e o n lights, rarely remember what the tale is.
The first visit usually starts with an over-keen reapp, desperate to show his
flock what a fun loving guy he is. A s you've already lost complete control
of all of your bodily functions, he suggests that it must be time for your first
visit to the mystical wonderland that is La Scandale. Being the rational mind
that you are at the end of a Tuesday night, you naturally agree.
This is it. You are finally going. Wait until you tell your friends in hall a n d
on your course that you were first to g o to what surely will b e c o m e your sec-
o n d h o m e a n d you c a n , them a n d the other 1 0 0 0 IC students waiting in
the cue. O n c e you're in, everything is going well, there's only o n e person
in front of you in the c u e for the bar. But the wait continues, in true La S c a n -
dale fashion he's ordering five triple vodkas a n d coke, three triple malibus
and orange a n d that's just for him. Encouraged by the fact his round only
c a m e to £1 5, you get two beers in, for you a n d the lady friend you've m a n -
a g e d to acquire, strangely she seems to be getting slightly more attractive
as the night progresses. The b a r m a n then blanks you a n d an eerie hush
ascends o n the venue. "Beer? £15 please"
Having c o m e with £25 in your wallet, a smile crosses your face as you
realise it's only 6 0 p for a shot a n d mixer, there's no way you c a n spend £25
with these prices, after all it must be nearly impossible to drink that much?
(Check your wallet tomorrow.)
You n o w feel confident e n o u g h to hit the dance floor a n d break out into the
one move you're sure impresses everyone. Even if you can't walk, you know
you can still pull (ask me about my election night) so you scour the room
for a friend who's already pulled a n d join the chain of people exchanging
their current partner for the person's next to them.
Fulfilled with your night a n d confident that by the morning you would have
forgot minor details such as whether she was attractive, where you live or
why you find yourself in a police cell (you know w h o you are M a r k Smith),
you finally return home.
Never has a pool of vomit, vodka a n d drunken w o m e n been so appealing.
