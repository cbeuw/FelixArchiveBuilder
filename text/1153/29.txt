Tasting Notes
Week Three : The Oven
The Basic Skill
Baking
In the last two weeks, we've covered
the basic skills needed to c o o k o n
the hobs. N o w , w e move to the
oven. I'm not g o i n g to talk a b o u t
baking cakes etc. Generally, this
requires you to follow recipes very
closely, which simply isn't m y style.
As always, I a m g o i n g to give s o m e
simple guidelines for making b e a u -
tiful, delicious f o o d , o u t of pretty
m u c h whatever you have to h a n d .
Individual ovens vary hugely, t o
the extent that times a n d t e m p e r a -
tures given in recipes a r e often a
long way off the mark for your oven.
However, with a little experience it is
very easy to work out the best ways.
As a quick a n d very rough
guide, 2 0 0 ° C , o r G a s M a r k 6 is
standard f o r most c o o k i n g . A n y -
thing higher is very hot, a n d will
burn most f o o d quickly. Below 1 60°
o r G a s M a r k 3 is c o o l , a n d only
really used for slow c o o k i n g .
O v e n s a r e used in two ways.
W h e n f o o d is c o o k e d uncovered, it
is exposed to a dry heat, which is
particularly g o o d at browning a n d
caramelising f o o d . Pretty m u c h any-
thing c o o k e d uncovered in an oven
looks more appetising than when it
went in. C o v e r e d food often c o m e s
out looking a n a e m i c . T h e a i m is
often to soften, particularly tough
cuts of meat, or to merge flavours.
M u c h covered oven c o o k i n g can b e
d o n e o n the stove top, but keeping
heat constant is easier in the oven.
Meal Suggestion
Garlic Mushrooms
A fantastic, simple idea from Nigel-
la Lawson. This is e n o u g h for one.
M a k e up s o m e garlic butter, by mix-
ing a large, crushed clove of garlic
with a r o u n d 5 0 g of butter. To pre-
pare a clove o f garlic, c h o p off the
stalk e n d , peel off the dry skin, a n d
c h o p into very small bits. C r u s h
between a hard surface a n d the
edge of the knife, o r with a garlic
press. You may need to melt the
butter f o r 1 0 s e c o n d s in the
microwave. If you have it, a d d s o m e
parsley, either a teaspoon of the
d r i e d stuff o r a s m a l l h a n d f u l
c h o p p e d fresh.
W a s h c o u p l e of the flat field
m u s h r o o m s , the stuff the mixture
round the e d g e . C o o k in the oven
for a b o u t 15 minutes at 2 0 0 ° , G a s
M a r k 6. W h e n they are d o n e , stuff
e a c h into a roll, a n d eat quickly!
Advanced Tip
Savoury Roulade
M a k i n g a basic savoury roulade is
surprisingly easy. Lots of pans are
required, but none of the steps are
too fiddley. The basic principle is t o
m a k e a thin sheet of s p o n g e , which
is rolled, like a swiss roll, but with a
sauce-like filling. The sponge is sim-
ply a thick white sauce, with a d d e d
e g g . T h e quantities here a r e
e n o u g h for two people.
Start by m a k i n g a simple roux in
a large sauce p a n . A b o u t 2 5 g but-
ter a n d a couple of level table-
spoons of flour should d o it. Slowly
mix in a r o u n d 2 0 0 m l of milk, leav-
ing a thick sauce. S e a s o n , this white
sauce with salt, pepper, a n d possi-
bly mustard p o w d e r a n d parmesan.
Leave the sauce t o c o o l for a few
minutes, then mix in the yoke of a n
e g g . Whisk the e g g white, then fold
it into the sauce.
Turn the mixture o u t onto a
baking tray, covered in well greased
baking sheet (about 3 0 c m x 2 0 c m ) .
Stick it in the oven at 2 0 0 ° o r G a s
M a r k 6 for a b o u t 1 0 minutes.
W h i l e the s p o n g e is c o o k i n g ,
m a k e s o m e kind of filling. I n o r m a l -
ly g o with broccoli a n d gruyere.
Start by m a k e a simple cheese
sauce (use the same procedure as
before, but with half the flour). C u t
a small h e a d of broccoli into very
small florets, discarding the stalk.
Steam for a r o u n d 5 minuets. W h e n
the sauce is finished, melt in a r o u n d
5 0 g of grated gruyere, then mix in
the broccoli.
The s p o n g e will probably need
to b e separated from the baking
sheet with a palette knife. Lay it
d o w n scraped side up, a n d spread
the sauce across all but 5 c m at o n e
short e n d . Finally, simply roll the
roulade from the other short e n d ,
cut into slices, a n d serve.
