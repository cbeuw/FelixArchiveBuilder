got doesn't help matters m u c h , a s I c a n only
barely r e m e m b e r what I actually d i d , let a l o n e
the g r a d e s . O n the other h a n d , after a s u m m e r
of living in a hall that's either empty o r full of tour
g r o u p s w h o don't s p e a k English, it's nice to have
s o m e students a r o u n d .

T h e q u e u e s set in a n d staff a n d students every-
where s e e m t o have their mental health b a l a n c e d
o n a knife e d g e . I'm not g o i n g to g o near the
U n i o n today if I c a n possibly help it. Suddenly
realise that I forgot to register last week, so s o m e -

1 8 year olds o n their first night of f r e e d o m .
Diary
The first inklings o f Freshers Flu a r e beginning to
s h o w themselves, a n d I feel yucky. N o t h e l p e d by
the fact that it's Freshers Fair today - sheer m a d -
ness, t e m p e r e d only by being rushed off my feet
for most of the afternoon. H e l e n a wins the " w h o
c a n b l a g the most free stuff" contest, collecting
four carrier b a g s full. A n d y a n d Joel d e c i d e to
launch a "find the fittest Fresher contest".
Diary
From my point of view, things start to c a l m d o w n
as the n e w intake h e a d off into their first lecture -
p o o r fools. Start reminiscing a b o u t m y Freshers
W e e k a n d suddenly realise that I p r o b a b l y went to
m o r e lectures in the first month than in the w h o l e
of last year. A t lunchtime a million p e o p l e a l l
s e e m t o want to g o to H a r l i n g t o n . I w a n d e r h o w
m a n y of them will w a n t to g o b a c k ?

w o r k e d this out yet t h o u g h , a n d they're all t r o o p -
ing into lectures a n d l a b like s h e e p . I'm sure
they'll learn the beauty of the w o r d s "full printed
c o u r s e notes" in a c o u p l e o f weeks. In t h e
evening it's time for the weirdest bit of the w e e k ' s
Ents - o n e m a n a n d his a m a z i n g l y silly d o g .
Diary
Finally it's Friday - o n e last d a y a n d the silliness
is over f o r a n o t h e r year. S h a m e really. Fortunate-
ly, before that there's still the Freshers C a r n i v a l ,
w h i c h is a perfect opportunity to watch hordes of
p e o p l e destroying w h a t little reputation they h a d .
If y o u haven't seen N a t a s h a N e w t o n a n d Kevin
