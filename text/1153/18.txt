' C u b e are shit', said my
not so subtle flatmate when
I brought this C D home.
Unfair, I think. Sure ifs a bit
leaky in places, but there's
some nice rock tunes o n it.
All fairly standard indie-
rock but laced with a n
eclectic mix of other
sounds. Listen carefully
and you c a n hear strains of
Radiohead a n d even Led
Zepplin.
Bizarreness aside, I c a n
really imagine the punters
at C a m d e n U n d e r w o r l d
bouncing around to o n e or
two of the songs o n a Fri-
day night, particularly Nat-
ural Millionaire a n d
G e o r g e . T h e quieter
songs a r e musically
d e p e n d a b l e but lyrically
uninspiring, which is a
shame. Further, this a l b u m
sticks to the rigid format of
'Rock anthem at the begin-
ning a n d mandatory classi-
cal instrument track further
on'. C u b e seem to think
of themselves as a
depressed neo-Verve.
All in a l l , it's a n a v e r a g e
a l b u m that c o u l d have
b e e n a lot, lot better. A
little t o o t w o d i m e n s i o n a l
perhaps?

Matador Artists
Everything is Nice
(Matador)
After 1 0 years in the business, M a t a d o r recordings have d e c i d e d to
give us this triple-CD compilation to celebrate. A s you would expect from
such a high-profile label, the back cover reads like a who's-who of indie
music: o n just o n e of the discs, there are contributions from the likes of
M o g w a i , Yo La Tengo, Pavement a n d the J o n Spencer Blues Explosion.
Supposedly a n overview of a decade at the cutting edge of music, I sus-
pect that the marketing people have in some way manipulated the track
selection to favour bands still putting out records, w h o a r e healthily repre-
sented, whilst neglecting excellent but defunct bands from nine years a g o .
I suppose that it is reasonable to expect a label to attract more established
names once properly established, but it is slightly disappointing that names
at the far e n d of the discography (which is thoughtfully included in the
sleeve notes) have been omitted.
For the trainspotters amongst you, o n e of the C D s contains only tracks that
were previously unreleased or available o n the b-side to the Japanese sin-
gle version, or some similarly obscure edition. Usually record companies
have a g o o d reason f o r not releasing a s o n g (namely that it is not very
good), a n d this disc is n o exception to that rule, despite some above-par
efforts. It's not even as if avid collectors of any o n e band will get particu-
larly excited, since the contributions c o m e from fifteen different artists.
In fact, this is the main problem with the entire compilation. The musical
scope of the a l b u m is impressively wide a n d encompasses many, perhaps
too many, styles. Little thought, however, has been given to the running
order, a n d the resulting mish-mash is little better than that which the shuf-
fle function o n any C D player would c o m e u p with. Whilst believing eclec-
ticism t o b e a g o o d thing, I d o feel that a coherent musical thread running
through the a l b u m w o u l d render the record more enjoyable.
Having said that, it w o u l d be unfair to dismiss the a l b u m out of hand.
Without picking any personal favourites, anyone ought to find something
to please them from the forty-plus tracks spanning this attractively present-
ed triple-pack. Far from being purely indie-rock, as the reputation of M a t a -
d o r m a y lead us t o believe, the music takes us into the realms of
drum'n'bass, underground hip-hop a n d leftfield electronica, which is often
g o o d . A s expected from such a renowned label, there is quality here. It's
just a question of isolating it.

Think back t o the early 8 0 s when p o p
music w a s proudly synthetic a n d d r u m
machines s o u n d e d like, er, machines. A
fat bird a n d a n effete bloke g o t together
(via M M classifieds) a n d p r o d u c e d t w o
a l b u m s with s o m e cracking tunes in a pro-
ductive two-year spell b e f o r e t h e
inevitable 'musical differences' bit. Vince
C l a r k e (ex D e p e c h e M o d e , a n d later Era-
sure) w a s your m a n . A l i s o n Moyet w a s
your w o m a n . T h e t w o mixed a n unlikely
c o m b i n a t i o n of electronics a n d blues with
sometimes sublime results.
This c o m p i l a t i o n attempts to distil the
essence of those p i o n e e r i n g times. Three
1 9 9 9 mixes, including a p u m p i n g Todd
Terry remix of Don't G o a r e tacked onto
the C D to e n c o u r a g e a y o u n g e r g e n e r a -
tion to buy, but Ibiza anthems they ain't.
Only You sounds like it's a g e d the least
gracefully, b l a m e the Flying Pickets f o r
that. Nobody's Diary shows that you c a n
still m a n a g e to meld d e e p soul singing
a n d evocative musical h o o k s a n d get that
'recorded o n a 4-track portastudio' effect.
Probably a C D for your elder siblings w h o
no l o n g e r spin their vinyl c o p i e s of
Upstairs At Eric's o r You A n d M e Both. It
includes their highlights a n d spares us
their really tedious experimental. It's hard
to imagine Y a z o o being given a hearing in
today's formulaic p o p world where record
c o m p a n i e s feel their profdits s o under
threat that anything experimental won't
get a fair c h a n c e . If your elder sibling
does buy it, be sure to listen. Be sure to
give it chance.
