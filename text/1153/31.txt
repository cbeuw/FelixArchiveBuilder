Community Action Group Sri Lankan Society
W e l c o m e to London! N o doubt you'll
be busy clubbing, visiting all the p o p -
ular bars and pubs, taking in the cul-
ture provided by numerous theatres
and galleries...but there is another
side to London that you might never
see. W h y not try helping out the c o m -
munity? If might give you a different
perspective o n life!
O u r oldest project is the Soup
Run for the homeless. Every Tuesday
and Thursday, w e meet at 8 . 0 0 p.m.
in the basement kitchen of Weeks
Hall in Princes G a r d e n s , where w e
prepare f o o d a n d hot drinks. W e
then g o by minibus into central Lon-
d o n , a r m e d with our bags of f o o d ,
urns a n d friendly conversation. There
are many interesting a n d dynamic
people to meet on the street so c o m e
along a n d give Soup Run a g o .
O u r second project involves vis-
iting Parkcare elderly nursing h o m e ,
ideally located off Q u e e n ' s G a t e .
Visits usually consist o f casual chats
with a resident o r joining in with a
group activity, such as bingo. Last
year, one student ran weekly origami
classes for residents. It is just a time
for the resident to have a break from
the monotony of the nursing home.
The third project is called Tools
for Self Reliance. This involves taking
second hand tools, such as saws and
hammers, a n d refurbishing them for
use in developing countries. But don't
worry - you don't need to know any-
thing about tool mending! O n c e
refurbished, these tool kits are sent
out t o c o m m u n i t y g r o u p s a n d
schools in Africa a n d a central part of
the project is building up awareness
of the technological problems associ-
ated with development.
W e are always interested in start-
ing new projects, so let us know if you
have any ideas. C o m e a l o n g to any
(or all!) of our projects. M e m b e r s h i p
is free a n d you don't have to make a
regular commitment. Helping the
community through volunteering will
definitely be a rewarding experience!
K n o w n through the ages as
Tabrobane, C e i l a o , Ceylon and even
Serendib, Sri Lanka is has gathered a
plethora of names each revealing its
richness a n d diversity.
At Imperial C o l l e g e , about 3 0 %
of students are from overseas from a
variety of countries each with their
own distinct cultures. While studying
in this environment, w e all have the
opportunity to mix with people from
these cultures a n d learn about them.
Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n has many
societies that have aims to promote
knowledge of these cultures to oth-
ers: ICU Sri Lankan society (ICUSLS)
is o n e of these societies.
W h e n travelling to another c o u n -
try, it is very easy to just follow a
tourist package holiday to see anoth-
er part of the world. It's quite possible
to simply live in a hotel and travel o n
organised tours to obtain a glimpse
of the nation. This is what many d o
each year a n d unfortunately they d o
not get a true feel for the culture;
peoples attitudes a n d beliefs. They
observe what others (the tour o p e r a -
tors) want them to see. They hear
only what a tourist video w o u l d tell
them, but they d o not fully under-
stand how the different cultures cause
people to think in different ways.
ICUSLS want to provide a plat-
form f o r e n c o u r a g i n g closer social
integration a m o n g Sri Lankans with
each other a n d other students at col-
lege. S o whatever your interest in Sri
Lanka, whether it b e family origin,
whether you have Sri Lankan friends
you w o u l d like to understand more
completely or even if you just want to
visit Sri Lanka f o r a holiday/work
experience/medical elective, ICUSLS
is here to help you.
The society is having its first g e n -
eral meeting this W e d n e s d a y in
R o o m 4 0 3 a , Fourth Floor, Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering at
2 p m . All are w e l c o m e a n d members
are usually privy to a free cinema trip
or g a m e of bowling.
