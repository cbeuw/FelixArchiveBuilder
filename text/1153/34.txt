Disco Squad dish out Royal(Holloway)thrashing
Hockey
ic in
Royal Holloway .
The almighty disco s q u a d , that saw
off I C S M ll's t o take the U L U
Reserve cup, a n d then went o n to win
the league a n d promotion, are back
with a vengeance.
This season's squad will dearly miss
the hairy m a n mountain o f Indian
Carpet C a t a l o g u e (aka J i m Taylor)
and the rod that is Rezoola.
But stepping in to fill the breech is
Jesus himself, Jamie Scurlock. Also
the wealth of fresh hockey talent
means that this Disco Squad is likely
to be the strangest in history.
A weakened Holloway side crept onto
the sacred astro at Harlington f o r
what they must have known would b e
a thrashing. Not to disappoint, the
Disco lads obligingly gave them one.
The score was o p e n e d with a beauti-
fully worked short corner, slotted away
in businesslike fashion by Fabio. Indi-
an Carpet C a t a l o g u e would have
dived a n d shimmied Holloway held
o n f o r 5 minutes more before the
heavens o p e n e d a n d they were simply
washed away.
O f the 1 5 goals, some were g o o d ,
most were scrappy. Final tally w a s
Fabio (Jervis) 6 , Jesus (Scurlock) 4 ,
Kiko 2 , The Sundance Kid, M a m m a s
a n d Bob Pyle 1.
The team that makes the whole of
London shake with fear is back. Disco
baby and role o n Saturday.

IC I 2
After t h e legendary s e a s o n last
year, it w a s all a bit d i s a p p o i n t -
ing today with a m e d i o c r e p e r f o r m -
a n c e .
The a w e s o m e m a c h i n e w a s not
particularly well-oiled a n d it h a d a
few new parts f r o m last year.
Steve, w h o started o n t h e left
side o f midfield, s h o w e d h e h a d a
few tricks with a mystical run d o w n
the w i n g but w e failed t o g e t t h e
ball t o him for the rest o f the g a m e .
The star o f t h e s h o w w a s clearly
Foulstone. With n o contact lenses
a n d still drunk f r o m Le S c a n d a l e , h e
dazzled us all with his skills, the pick
of t h e b u n c h a classy t r e a d i n g o n
the ball a n d falling over, gifting the
King's f o r w a r d with a run o n g o a l .
The g o a l s c a m e f r o m t h e mid-
f i e l d , t h e first a seventy y a r d
(maybe) shot f r o m D a v e . King's
e q u a l i s e d within a minute, but I C
took the lead a g a i n with N i c k ' s n o t
so classic finish, a s h e p o u n c e d like
a mynx d u r i n g a g o a l m o u t h s c r a m -
ble. O n c e a g a i n King's hit straight
b a c k , this time within two minutes.
All in a l l , a d i s a p p o i n t i n g start,
but at least w e never let them have
a sniff in t h e s e c o n d half a n d IC
c o u l d have w o n it w h e n Tony w a s
put t h r o u g h by a m o v e with W a r -
ren, A l e x a n d D a v e .
IC II ...
K i n g ' s
First g a m e o f the s e a s o n , a n e w
b e g i n n i n g . This was a t e a m that
the s e c o n d s thrashed towards the
e n d o f last s e a s o n o n the w a y t o
w i n n i n g the l e a g u e - s o m u c h w a s
expected.
A great start w a s m a d e by
mighty I C , playing t h e ball c o n f i -
dently all o v e r the park. Alistair a n d
D a v e were the b a c k b o n e a n d then
N a c b o a n d D a r r e n s u p e r b o n the
flanks. T h e n they started t o find
their stride, a few rash tackles later
then a very slight push by Elliot in
the box s a w then g e t a penalty -
result Ricky saves amazingly.
After a stern talk f r o m J o h n at
half time s e c o n d half started, then
greatest contribution o f a l l , Brad
Baskett c o m e s o n up front for his IC
debut. Two minutes later he's b a c k
o n the t o u c h line for a horrible off
the ball incident. With ten it w a s
always a n uphill battle a n d i n t h e
85th minute they g o t t h e break
through with a minute t o g o M a r t i n
hit the post - but it was all t o o late.

After finishing a s the best p l a c e d
4th t e a m in L o n d o n last year,
we started this year with a d i s a p -
pointing p e r f o r m a n c e . Things have
to i m p r o v e o r w e won't g e t any-
where near the legendary status w e
a c h i e v e d . T h e 1st half wasn't b a d ,
with B o l a b e i n g a n a n i m a l in m i d
field a n d Knut Rod stretching their
b a c k line with great m a k i n g l o n g
halls. Peynouz h a d a g o o d g a m e
o n t h e left a n d the b a c k line w a s
s o u n d .
O u r front line in the 1 st half ran
their hearts o u t but t o n o avail, it
finished 0 - 0 a t halftime but w e
c a m e o u t with t h e captain's m a d
rants a n d raves ringing in o u r ears.
Pee, C h i n ' s a n d N i c k c a m e o n in
the s e c o n d half b u t w e . c o n c e d e d
two g o a l s in t e n minutes. W e ral-
lied briefly afterwards with Pee m a k -
ing s o m e g o o d runs but w e went
d o w n 2 - 0 in the e n d .
