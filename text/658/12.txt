Squash
At last! Many apologies for the delay. Con-
gratulations to the first team who have lost
only a single game in all their matches. The
second team has been rather badly inter-
rupted by players being away constantly, but
have no excuses now. The thrids and fourths
definitely need a bit more needle (or bottle as
they say) however the fifths are holding their
own very successfully. If anyone has been
trying to join but in vain, and is still keen,
leave a message on the Squash noticeboard.
Keep challenging on the ladder (ladies as
well) since there is definitely room for im-
provement in the teams. The Squash Club
dinner was most succesful ????. Thanks John.
Tough on those who missed out.
Keep playing, and enjoy your squash.
It is our lower sides which are particularly
. weak at the moment so beginners who feel
that they have a certain degree of coordina-
tion will have a good chance of being selected
for the University fixtures which are often
exciting and very close matches. A certain
amount of coaching may also be available
depending on the generosity of Union funds.
Bowls
Imperial College made the long trek to the
Airport Bowl last Saturday, to play the al-
ways strong Brunei University side (100 mem-
ners in the club—large financial assistance
from their Union etc etc). As expected we got
well trounced, an embarrassing whitewash
saved only by some good bowling by our B
team. Things have got to improve and if
anybody feels they could contribute to the
performance of the team will they please
come bowling this Wednesday. We meet at
2:30pm in Chem Eng foyer and take a coach
down to Tolworth Bowl (about 20 minutes
away).
Mens 1 v QMC won 7-2
Extract from the 'Diary of Ian Bull'
Pranced about at several College parties the
night before. Almost spoke to the Rector, but
he was too pissed. Got up 5:00am, attended
27 committee meetings before breakfast.
Puked up. Must make sure no one finds out I
went to lectures, or my Presidential credi-
bility will be fucked.
Had 18 pints of Guinness at lunch time.
Played badminton in the afternoon at QMC
with the FELIX Sport Ed. Lucky I was, or we
wouldn't have won 2 out of 3 games. Lee and
Steve won all 3, but Dom and Mike lost one.
Dom's so imcompetent!
Afterwards listened to Burglar Alarm in
Bar. Had a Curry on way back. Farted on
tube. In the evening I made a PA in South-
side, but I was too tired to start a Beerfight.
Only smoked 10 packets of fags today, cut
down from 30 yesterday. Then I went to some
more parties. A very credible day.
The club meal will be on Thursday 1 Dec-
ember, venue to be decided. On Friday, a
Chelsea College vandal trashed the Badmin-
ton locker. Anyone knowing more about this
senseless crime should see me as soon as
possible!
Cricket
I've forgotten what happened in last week's
exciting episode, but I'm sure it was thrilling!
IC Cricket Tour Torquay 1983 (or the Dirty
Dozen meet Helga the mud wrestler from
Hamburg)
Captains Log
Star date 24.6.83
Forgot to put handbrake on minibus whilst
endeavouring to fill up with petrol. Wasted
2'/2 hours retriving said bus from the ditch.

Arrived at Yelverton CC '/2 hour late to be
greeted by a thunderstorm.
Discovered new hobby: watching the ducks
paddling on the square.
Then saw Eastland doing the Disco Duck,
scoring 63 runs in 7 overs, whilst continually
adjusting his box. Eastland managed to avoid
getting arrested on the first night this year.
This makes 'Star Wars' look like a film-Sports
Ed.
