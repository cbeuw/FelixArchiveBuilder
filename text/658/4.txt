Romps Home!
NO MORE PASSES
FOR JOHNNY BOY
< It seemed just like a normal bars
conference to ex-IC Union Presi-
dent John Passmore—until he
met gorgeous Kate from
Westfield that is!
And then rumours abounded
in Union circles linking John's
name with Kate's. But the wily
Irishman denied it all.
'Our relationship is purely-
professional,' he proclaimed.
But John's reputation as IC
Union Superstud • went before
him. It came as no surprise when
he announced this week that he
and Kate were engaged to be
married.
Sean Davis was too upset to
comment.

Gaynor
No Morals
Gaynor Lewis, Union President,
was severely criticised for her
lack of morals in the Union
Office on Monday. Facing a
crowd of four members of the
female public, she faced a stream
!of abuse of this year's (already
I heavily censored) Rag Mag. *
Arriving for their appointment
at the Union Office, the com-
plainants received an immediate
set back when they discovered
that their complaint was directed
at last year's Rag Mag.
Not dismayed however, they
started to read this year's version,
immediately taking offence at
every joke.
They dismissed the publication
as racist, sexist and inhuman, and
left shouting abuse at everyone in
sight.
Carl Burgess, Editor of this
year's Rag Mag was deeply hurt,
pointing out that jokes are there
to be laughed at not analysed for
social comment.
FELIX
