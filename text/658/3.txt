Gaynor
Fooled
Again
Union President Miss Gaynor
Lewis and the Rector Lord
Flowers may be the victims of a
practical joke concerning the
threat of legal action by the
recently opened Sainsburys
supermarket.
The Rector's office received a
phone call from someone claim-
ing to be the supermarket man-
ager threatening to take College
to court unless IC students
stopped removing shopping trol-
leys from the premises. The
Rector expressed his concern to
Miss Lewis and asked her to take
action.
A worried Miss Lewis imme-
diately started taking legal advice
from the Police and the College
legal service.
However, neither the super-
market manager or Sainsbury's
head office have any knowledge
of such action. The manager
suggested that perhaps the
College had been the victim of a
practical joke.
Expansion
Delayed
Phase One of the expansion of
Union facilities to Southside is
making slow progress. Work that
should have been started by the
College Estates section over the
summer has only now begun.
Work has begun on a weights
room and a central launderette in
the basement, and the conversion
of the old Southside refectory to a
gym for martial arts and table
tennis. Phase One is due for
completion on 5 March 1984.
It is hoped that there will soon
be squash courts and a sauna
built into the old refectory.
Phase Two of the plan, which
Miss Lewis denies the Union has
accepted, will be the move of the
Union Office to the Southside
Upper Lounge.
Aerosoc
Darts
The annual Aerosoc paper darts
competition provided the usual
variety of unpowered flying
contraptions.
The longest flight was 50.35
seconds achieved by Mark Rest
using a parachute and the great-
est range by Benjamin Fielle
whose dart sailed the entire
length of the Quad.

Two Ways to Get Plastered!
The RCS Beer Festival, held on Wednesday in the JCR proved to be a
successful opener to Rag Week raising over £500 for charity. This is
hardly surprising, since swilling large quantities of ale is one of the few
things most IC students can be bothered to do!
The Festival passed without any great incident, except for the arrival of
the Hit Squad who performed a large scale 'random hit' on anyone
unfortunate enough to be in the way.
The organiser of the Beer Festival, Gareth Fish, said that he expected
the final profits to be in the region of £500.
Bot Zoo Tea:
The Saga Continues
The campaign to get the Botany
Zoology Tea Room open is being
stepped up by Life Science
students. Next Thursday a 'Tea
In' will be staged where cups of
tea and coffee will Be served
between 10:00 and 11:00am.
Mr Peter Burt, spokesman for
the protesters, said to FELIX
that the demonstration was to
show Professor Wood the
strength of feeling for the re-
oping of the tea room. He hoped
that all those who enjoyed the tea
room in previous years would
attend the demonstration. Mr
Burt sees this as the last attempt
to get the tea room open.
ICU Flouts ULU Ban
Over £7,000 of University of
London money has been spent on
the presentation of honorary
degrees to dignitories who have in
some way helped the University.
The only students invited to
attend this lush event are sabbati-
cal officers of each college and
ULU officials.
Gaynor Lewis, ICU President,
says it is a prestigious occarion
that will benefit IC (and herself-
Ed) as all those attending will
meet influential people who have
a say in the finance of IC.
GUC, the governing body of
ULU, have mandated their Exec
not to accept the invitations as it
is their opinion that the ceremony
is unnecessary.
Spaccd-Out Sounds
Mr Desmond Briscoe, the former
head of the BBC's Radiophonic
Workshop lectured to a packed
meeting of the H G Wells Society
last Monday.
His talk spanned the history of
the Workshop, from the pioneer-
ing days of the late fifties, when
all the equipment available was a
taperecorder and a pair of
scissors, to up to date work with
computer synthesisers.
His talk was illustrated with
material from the Radiophonic
Archive. Highlighst included the
Dr Who theme and extracts from
the Hitchiker's Guide to the
Galaxy,

News
For God's Sake
No!
An overwhelming 'No' was the
answer IC students gave to a
recent IC Union survey on NUS
reaffiliation. Predictably, the
aversion to reaffiliating was the
cost of membership and NUS's
political extremism.
The news for NUS wasn't all
bad however, a convincing ma-
jority sought further debate,
although members of Coucil
were conspicuous by their ab-
absence of this group. Unity with
other colleges topped the reasons
for reaffiliation, together with a
need for a voice in material
bargaining, highlighting the
sense of isolation caused by
disaffilation.
Despite the incentive of win-
ning a bottle of wine by returning
the questionnaire, the proportion
returned was a disappointing
25%.
UGC to
Slay Sacred
Cows?
The University Grants Commit-
tee has written to the Vice-
Chancellors and Principals of all
unversity intstitutions to encou-
age debate on the future of the
university system in the light of
falling student numbers. It is esti-
mated that between the late 1980s
and mid 1990s the number of
suitably qualified school leavers
will fall by between 15% and 20%
due to demographic trends. The
UGC is posing a series of
questions to universities about
how they propose to cope with
the drastic changes such a drop
will necessitate.
Areas previously considered
untouchable are being brought
into question by the UGC, for
example the question of aca-
demic tenure and the length of
degree courses. Also covered in
the 29 questions are topics such
as changing the balance between
technological and arts subjects,
funding for research, increasing
the financial contribution from
non-public funds, and the rela-
tionship between universities and
polytechnics. Universities are
asked to reply by the end of
March next year, and FELIX will
be reporting on the College's
response as soon as it is formu-
lated.
