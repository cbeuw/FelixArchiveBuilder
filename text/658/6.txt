It may be obvious what 'Rag and Drag' involves and
you may have heard about Silly Sports, but what of
S C A B Night? This is a somewhat obscure event whose
title gives little help to anyone who tries to find out what
it involves. Fortunately, with three quarters of a page at
my disposal, all uncertainties can be removed and you
will be able to decide whether S C A B Night, among the
maze of other Rag events, is worth attending.
SCAB is the somewhat preten-
tiously titled 'Social, Cultural and
Amusement Board' which joins
together the performing societies
in College. Dramatic Society,
Opejatic Society, a range of music
societies, Debating Society, Film
Society and Jazz Club all
contribute to make a night of
varied and amusing entertain-
mentt, the profit of which goes to
IC Rag funds. This year's offering
promises much with all the
SCAB clubs contributing.
Dramsoc are showing just
how coarse their acting really can
be by peforming three of Michael
Green's 'Coarse Acting' plays:
'Streuth', 'Alls Well That Ends As
You Like It' and 'II Fornicazione'.
'Streuth' takes the piss out of the
many Agatha Christie thrillers
that have been dramatised, with
the only question remaining to be
answered being: was it the
butler? 'Alls Well That Ends As
You Like It' pokes fun at
Shakespeare, notably Shakes-
peare as performed by an all girls
public school. Assembling the
necessary female cast, from
Imperial College, must have
proved difficult but, no doubt,
the lecherous talents of the
direction had much to do with it.
The final play is 'II Fornicazione'
which pokes fun at the perfor-
mance of amateur operatic soci-
eties with a taste for Gilbert &
Sullivan ie like IC Operatic
Society. Indeed, so complete is
the analogy that Dramsoc
director Nick Moran is
considering performing 'II
I"

Fornicazione' directly after
Opsoc's SCAB Night offering,
but fears retribution from Opsoc
chairman Jo Claydon. It is to be
hoped that he has the courage of
his convictions and is not pushed
around just because Jo is bigger
than him.
Indeed Opsoc are not just
performing one Gilbert & Sulli-
van opera but small pieces from
several of them. There will be
highlights from their greatest hits
repertoire of HMS Pinafore, the
Pirates of Penzance, Ruddigore
and Yeoman of the Guard. All
the pieces are well known and
will be presented with all the
spontaneity of under-rehearsal.
But seriously, if you want a good
laugh and fancy hearing what '
they sound like it will be well
worth while and Jo Claydon will
be buying a few drinks in the bar
afterwards—for a change.

eveing. However, this most wel-
come contribution is a barber's
shop quartet. While there is no
performance this year from Wind
Band, the Chamber Music
Society will be showing what
they do best: messing around
with a piano. The rotund Robin
Graham will be dressing up in a
policeman's outfit and ensuring
that all proceedings are suitably
legal.
After appearances from the
Devil's advocate, Mrs Mop and
Pooh Bear last year in a balloon
debate, the Debating Society
are promising no less obscure
characters such as a Sloane
Ranger and the infamous
Michael Newman, perhaps
appearing as Jesus Christ. The
Jazz Club's band for the event
is Horizon who performed last
year at the Fremantle Hotel and
ensured that all of the residents
heard the gig—especially those
foolhardy enough to try to get to
sleep.
To complete the evening Film
Society are showing two films:
Woody Allen's hilarious All You
Wanted to Know About Sex but
Were Afraid to Ask providing all
the information that didn't go
into Sean Davis' little white
book and Vampire Loves with
Peter Cushing chasing lots of
nasty female vampires. Until
11:00pm there will be a bar
outside the Concert Hall and
food will be available. All of the
clubs have put in a lot of effort
and the end product will be well
worth reading. It all starts at
7:30pm this Saturday in the
Union Concert Hall, entrance
£1.50 on the door.
