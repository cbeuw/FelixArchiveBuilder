RSMU Rants
Dear Sit-
As a member of R S M U 1
would like to set the record
straight. As a union we are
getting extremely fed up with
other groups at IC perpetuating
the image they think we should
have and promoting this trave-
esty with their propaganda
campaigns.
: R S M U is an organisation
with no political leanings and
feels that a great deal of I C U
timers being wasted on political
issues which could be far better
used on matters of direct
concern to students; after all,
that's what the Union is for. As
a Union we don't try to impress
our views on others, so we don't
see why others should try to
force us to conform to their
values. There is no such thing as
the 'Mines block vote', no
attempt is made to coerce
people into voting for a parti-
cular viewpoint at UGMs but
what I will say is enough people
care about their Union to want
to preserve its individuality and
freedom of expression.
Finally I would like to voice
my disgust with the manner in
which the 'antipornography'
vote was carried out. The
matter was handled so ineptly
and the meeting had degener-
ated into such a shambles that I
do not see how a fair account
could be obtained from the
paper ballot.
Yours etc

Dear Pallab
I was appalled to read in the
U G M report in Friday's
F E L I X that Neil Stewart
literally wiped the floor with the
other speakers. Is it really
necessary for the N U S Presi-
dent to use such violent means
to gain his ends?
Secondly, I note that your
front page headline proclaims a
'Caption Competion' (sic). I'm
glad to see there's nothing half-
hearted about your campaign
to ban tits from F E L I X . (I
thought I'd make an exception in
publishing your letter-Ed.)
Yours sincerely

Dear Pallab
I just want to say how
sickened I am that despite
having a Union that resembles a
kipper—yellow, two-faced,
spineless and without teeth—
people still can't be bothered to
get off their bums to go to
UGMs.
The block vote tactics used
by the Miners make the voting a
mockery. The fact that vacant
Union posts are not sufficiently
advertised makes the elections a
mockery. The fact that I C U
sabbaticals can get away with
doing bugger all makes the
Union a mockery and an insult
to the student body, although
most students don't seem to
mind this.
I must admit that Ents are
usually good, particularly
even* organised by the CCUs,
but ICU's laudable claim to be
non-political seems to stretch to
student politics and student
representation. We need good
representation if we are to avoid
being trampled all over and we
need more students at U G M s to
stop them from being fiascos
and to lend weight to any
motions passed.
Please come along to the next
U G M , at the very least you'll
get a chance to make a paper
aeroplane.

The Bad
Dear Pallab
I would like to start vicious/
delicious rumours about the
reforming of the IC Social
Democratic Society. We offer
no pregnant secretaries, Welsh
frogs, just nice letters to Pallab
(is that creepy enough?).
Seriously, we hope to pro-
mote David Owen lookalikes in
College, encourage Shirley
Williams hairdos and start
intellectual discussion on SDP
policies—the latter will be the
easiest (and then, perhaps not).
Rumours commence, may
claret be served.

What Election
Promises?
Sir
What happened to the witty,
cutting, satirical, invective-
laden style of editorship that
you promised us back at Easter?
Without doubt you started off
on the right foot with an expose
of that arrogant windbag in
Student Services; what has
happened since? Headlines on
pigeons and issues devoted
almost entirely to careers,
worthy though they may be, are
hardly your supposed style.
Editorials on the Moonies,
NUS etc aren't very original,
neither are little personal digs at
people who have criticised you.
What happened? Did the flabby
pansy threaten to sue you or
something?
Moving onto pastures new,
why don't we have a few digs at
that paragon of cock-ups—the
College administration and
other bureaucrats. For instance
what was the real point of
building all that parking con-
trol rubbish? They haven't
actually saved any money by
getting rid of any labour so it
was rather pointless to blow all
that money (£10,000, £15,000
whatever).
Why did they hire all that
Meccano to go round Elec Eng
and then leave it for six weeks,
building up a massive hire
charge? I'll tell you: it was
specially done so that the
workmen could come in on
Monday 3 October and cause
maximum noise and inconveni-
ence to a maximum number of
people. Our caring Sherfield
building strikes again.
Why not dig a little and
justify your election?
Yours faithfully

the College £700,000. There will
be afull expose soon. Thefull facts
are not dug up over night. -Ed)
Academic
Affairs
Dear Pallab
We must confess to being
astounded by the revelation in
the last edition of F E L I X that
the Academic Affairs Commit-
tee is one that 'nobody ever
attends'.
This is yet another incidence
of the factual inaccuracy in
reporting which we have come
to expect from F E L I X . We
suggest that in future, should
F E L I X wish to comment con-
structively on the workings of
the Union that reporters should
get off their arses and venture
out of the F E L I X Office into
the real world
(Up) Yours

Dear Pa/lab
I wonder if any of your
readers have noticed the simi-
larities between Prof R R S
Wood FRS and a certain
Austrian gentleman? Perhaps,
by chance they are related?
