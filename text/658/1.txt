A postgraduate student from
the College Sports Centre last
Christopher Artemiou, a 24
year old graduate studying arche-
ology and anthropology at
Chelsea College turned up at a
meeting of the University of
London Rifle Shooting Club
meeting and said he would be
interested in joining. The rifle
range superintendent took him
onto the range and showed him
how tofirethe gun. On leaving the
range to reload his rifle the
superintendent heard a shot and
returned to the room. Mr
Chelsea College was shot dead at
Thursday at 7:30pm.
Artemiou was found dead, shot
through the head.
Police and forensic scientists
were immediately called in by the
Sports Centre officials. On arri-
val they sealed off the area and
questioned people as they left. A
post-mortem was held on
Monday and the matter is being
treated as suicide. Contents of
letters found in the deceased's
pocket have not been disclosed
by the Police.
The pistol used in the incident, a Smith and Weston 0.41.
Shit to hit
the fans
The barbaric ritual of the
Morphy Day fight will go ahead
later this year despite complaints
from Putney residents to the
Rector after the vandalism by IC
students after last year's Morphy
Day.
Morphy Day itself is an inter-
CCU boat race along the Thames
starting from Putney. It is
traditional for the CCUs to fight
for the Morphy Oar once the race
has started. This usually deger-
ates to a neanderthal punch-up
with fish guts, offal and dung
being hurled.
Putney residents felt that the
event went too far last year with
many having their dustbin lids
stolen by IC students.
A letter was sent to the Rector
by the local MP David Mellor.
The Rector expressed his concern
to the then IC Union President
Stephen Goulder who took ac-
tion by making it Council policy
that IC Union will not have
anything to do with the event.
The CCUs will stage the fight
this year further down the river in
the hope that the rising tide will
wash the Vness away. Mr Dave
Parry, RCSU Vice President, has
said that the CCUs will not take
any precautions to ensure that
their members will behave them-
selves on the day.
£300 to go to NUS
It was decided at IC Union
Council on Monday night that
over £300 pounds of IC Union
money will be spent sending three
people to the NUS conference in
Blackpool later this year. The IC
Union delegates will have hotel
accommodation, subsidised food
and drink and numerous parties
all paid for by the Union. The
cost per person is estimated at
£65-75 plus travel expenses.
The delegates to be sent will all
be from IC Union Council and
will comprise a member of the
Exec (presumably Miss Gaynor
Lewis), External Affairs Officer
Peter Burt, and one other.
Mr Mike Stuart, President of
City and Guilds Union, opposed
sending anyone to the conference
on the grounds that Imperial
College is not a member of NUS.
Mr Stuart, the only person on
Council prepared to ask
awkward questions, sees the
conference as an attempt by Miss
Lewis to increase the already
large number of free parties,
meals and drink parties she
already enjoys at the Union's
expense.
Hon Sec Mr Sean Davis is also
totally opposed to the sending of
Union delegates to the confer-
ence. In an interview with FELIX
Mr Davis described the action as
'a bloody waste of Union money,
especially when we're having to
turn down many urgent claims
from clubs and societies for more
money'.
