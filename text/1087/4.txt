St Mary's elections look for equality
KENT YIP
The Student Union of St Mary's
Hospital Medical School may well
have its first ever full time sabbatical
president next academic year, putting
it on par with all the other medical
schools in London. The election has
been scheduled for next Thursday
22nd and Friday and 23rd May, and
hustings will take on Wednesday the
21st May.
Since the nomination paper will
not come down until this Friday, only
three candidates so far have put their
names forward to stand for positions
in the executive committee of the
union. Nick Jenkins, Dave Shepherd,
and Chris Lawrence are the sole can-
didates for Vice President External,
Information Rep and Accom-
modation Rep respectively. At the
time of print, only Andrew Smith, a

The "nightmare" that was the recent
National Union of Students National
Conference in Blackpool has led sev-
eral universities to consider whether
to join ICU and be outside of the
nationwide Union. Aberdeen,
Stirling, Paisley, Kings, LSE and
Bristol are all considering referenda
to disassociate themselves, and
Sheffield Hallam go to the ballot
boxes next week to decide their
second year pre-clinical student, has
declared his intention to go for the
sabbatical president post. It has been
suspected that the requirement to
take a year out for this job has
deterred other potential candidates
from coming forward. Another per-
son who has also strongly expressed
his wish to contest for the VPE post
but yet to confirm his candidature is
Andrew King.

education, medics' identity, and their
social life after the merger to be his
main priorities. He would like to
ensure that equal attention would be
paid to the educational needs of the
current students on the old curricu-
lum by the new medical school,
which concentrated most of its effort
on the new course recently. On the
issue of merger, he said that he would
The Conference was widely per-
ceived to have been hijacked by the
two primary political factions within
the movement - the controlling "New
Labour" group and the rival
Campaign for Free Education - who,
according to U L U President Sarah
White intimidated the remaining del-
egates, successfully stopping them
speaking. For example, in line with
Labour policy, the NUS has recently
given up it's bitter struggle to retain
grants, in favour of a loan-based sys-
tem. Such political affiliation is noth-
ing new - in the recent General
Election five former NUS Presidents
became MP's. However, the level of
barracking and in-fighting were con-
sidered far worse than anything seen
in recent years, with the Glasgow SU
describing the NUS as representing
"not students but political parties"
This view was compounded when,
without any consultation of dele-
gates, the National Executive
Committee (described as "a bunch of
middle-class twats" by Scottish rep-
resentatives) cut the final day of the
Conference, so that delegates had a
chance to "assist campaigning in the
General Election" in their
Universities. Mary Page, President of
Sheffield Hallam, was "deeply
depressed" by the Conference, and as
a result organised their forthcoming
referendum. Eric Allsop, ICU
President, has offered her his full
support and knowledge of how stu-
dents unions can survive outside the
NUS.
do his best to overcome the antago-
nistic feeling between the medics and
the rest of the College, though he
maintained that he would be against
any deliberate move to force the
medics to integrate against their
wish. He would also try to keep up
the excellent reputation of St Mary's
in its music, drama and sporting
achievement when the new intakes
arrive. Closer to home, his concern
would be to the keep the med school
bars at the separate hospital sites
open.
Mr Jenkins, candidate for the post
of VPE, is currently the first year rep
in the Student Union, and has only
been at Mary's for one year. In refut-
ing the accusation that his sole inten-
tion for taking up the job was to use
it as a stepping stone to further his
own political career, he explained his
The Scottish Universities, howev-
er, have more specific complaint
with the National Union. As well as
dissatisfaction with the Blackpool
Conference, they site alleged forgery
and corruption within the Scottish
NUS. At the meeting of the Scottish
Executive to decide what was to be
discussed in Blackpool, Keith
Robson, President of the NUS in
Scotland, produced a letter which
proxied him the vote of Ros Smith,
from Langside College, Glasgow.
However, Ms Smith says that the let-
ter had a forged signature, spelt her
name wrong, and was not on College
notepaper. Rob Shorthouse of
Stirling University claims that he has
copies of forged documents, not only
from Langside, but from many other
Scottish universities.
Students of Aberdeen University
immediately began attempts to disaf-
filiate, and rapidly gained five-hun-
dred signatures on a petition calling
for a ballot. However, the petition
had to be withdrawn, as leaving NUS
would mean loosing the services of
NUS Services Ltd, who, in return for
£30 000 a year, provide the cut price
drinks on which their Union relies.
The loss of NUSSL would, accord-
ing to their President, "send the
Union to the wall". However, now

Universities to join ICU in the pri-

belief in being involved with the run-
ning of the union early on; he saw his
junior position in the medical school
as an advantage, because by the time
the merger would take place, he
would still be in his first clinical year,
and thus would have both the time
and experience to continue to help
running the union of the new medical
school. He would also like to encour-
age more people from his year to be
involved with the SU. He wanted to
help develop a fierce pride for ICSM
among the new intakes, and saw the
current postural gesture adopted by
some medics against the rest of the
College as damaging.
Other posts to be contested include
Vice President Internal, Treasurer,
Social Rep, Deputy Social Rep,
Clubs and Societies Rep, Education
Rep, Welfare Rep and Bar Manager.

Mobile dog patrols will be a good
way of keeping in contact with off-
site security officers."
It is planned that the patrols will
start at midday at off-campus sites
and continue until the early hours of
the morning. On the South
Kensington Campus, there will be
random patrols made during the
night, with extra attention at peak
hours, such as when the Union clos-
es.
Security have advertised in-house
for dog handlers and Mr Weir has
already had several applications.
However, as the dog effectively
becomes the handler's 'pet', there
are many prerequisites and the appli-
cants have to be properly vetted. If
enough handlers are found in-house,
then no extra handlers will be hired.
Mr Weir is optimistic as to the
success of the scheme but is aware
that he may receive a lot of com-
plaints. He was keen to reassure stu-
dents and staff that "Though the
dogs might be considered intimidat-
ing by some, they are not there to
subdue or attack, they are simply an
extension of the handler and there to
protect them." Confident that the
dogs will reduce crime, Mr Weir
said that "...with dogs IC will be a
far safer place."
