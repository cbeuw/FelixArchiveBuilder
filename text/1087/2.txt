Hustings "grilling"
continued from front page
Mary's. The husting as described by
Clare was "more intensive. I certain-
ly got a grilling". This time round she
was asked about her views on a
broader range of subjects, although
the focus was still on the merger.
More questions were based around
her and her experience within the
union, in which she admitted that she
has never turned up to a ICU council
meeting and her only involvement
has been in the Entertainments com-
mittee and being a DJ.
Her mains goals as president next
year would be to "promote harmony
between the two unions by promot-
ing inter contact in sports societies,
and also to fight about the issue of
top up fees". A main point that
repeatedly turned up was how she
saw the role of the additional sabbat-
ical position intended to be created at
the end of the next college year, her
views was that the post should be a
"Mary's" sabb and that it's main
role, in it's first year at least, was to
aid the medics in their transition to
the South Kensington site, she also
stated that the post should go to a
medic as they "understand the pres-
sure that a medical student is under
better than an IC student."
When asked what she would have
done had she been president this
year, she brought up two main
points. Firstly was the loss of the
bookstore, she saw it "was a great
shame because it meant that,
although college has increased the
union's funding by Â£20,000 to
replace the income lost, it makes the
union more dependent on the col-
leges finances as opposed to being
independent body, but it has also cre-
ated a greater profile for the union as
a whole as students have became
more aware of their services and out-
lets".
Secondly was that she would not
have accepted the move of the exams
to the marquee, and believes that the
union should have lead some kind of
a revolt with the students against the
idea. She also commented that the
president should be more accessible,
and that she would make herself
more visible around the union mak-
ing it easier for students to approach
her.
When asked why she did not drink
the 8 pints that were bought for her as
a challenge, she said "I just had to
keep my head up there, but I plan to
finish the pints and carry on drinking
till late into the night."
Lives saved from fire
KELLY ROBINSON A N D
MAHLINA PONNIAH
Thousands of lives were heroically
saved on Tuesday when the air-con-
ditioning system in a Biochemistry
lab spontaneously combusted.
Several brave men in heavy breath-
ing apparatus battled through the
smoke to rescue the defenceless vic-
tims.
Shortly before 9am, in a room on
the sixth floor of the Biochemistry
building, the electric motor of an air-
conditioning unit burnt out, allowing
the unit to overheat, and resulting in
an isolated fire. Graham Cox, IC's
own Fire Officer, arrived on the
scene, and on ascertaining that the
smoke was not too thick, proceeded
to enter the room, together with Mick
Rogers, the Technical Services
Manager for Biochemistry, and two
fire engineers, who were also present
at the time (although quite how all
those people managed to squeezed
into the room at the same time
remains a mystery!)
The room was home to several
thousand fruit-flies and Mr Cox's
immediate priority was to remove
these occupants to safety; after first
donning the appropriate safety gear.
Once the flies were out of harm's
way Mr Cox used a nearby carbon
dioxide extinguisher to smother the
"flames" and Mr Rogers switched
off the power to the air-conditioning
unit. Due to the small nature of the
fire, the smoke alarms failed to acti-
vate and the fire alarms had to be
sounded manually. According to Mr
Cox the building "was evacuated
quickly and quietly; with little dis-
ruption to the running of the depart-
ment."
On further investigation it was dis-
covered that the switch controlling
the motor was jammed in the 'on'
position, a fault which should have
been detected earlier, and this is what
caused the system failure.
The room should be fully func-
tional within a few days as Mr
Rogers is already in possesion of
replacement parts for the damaged
unit. However, Mr Cox said that the
room will "require a fresh coat of
paint" and one or two of the ceiling
tiles will need to be replaced. The
sole remaining problem is that of the
distinct smoke-like odour of the fruit
flies.
Presidential Interview
Interview by Andrew, edited by ]lten
Andrew Dorman Smith: So, New
Election tell us about yourself.
New Election:
Basically, New Election is your
opportunity to vote to re-open nomi-
nations. This time of year is particu-
larly bad for having elections many
people still have exams and haven't
had the time to see what's going on
in College. The view is that there
are probably much stronger candi-
dates out there who haven't yet had
the chance or the time to stand this
time, so if you don't like the way
the election is looking, if you don't
like the candidate, vote New
Election and maybe we'll get third
time lucky.
ADS: Thank you. We now turn to
Clare Bunston. Clare, do you
believe it's the Union's job to get
more students interested in the
Union?
CB: Yes, but it's really hard to get
people involved who have no inten-
tion of getting involved.
ADS: Exactly that's the whole
dilemma, how are you going to get
those students involved?
CB: I don't know. I would just do
my best, hopefully I would be seen
as a President who is a normal
human being who represents some-
thing that anyone can be a part of,
as opposed to a little group of peo-
ple who just go about their own
doings, it's not a very accessible
group to become a part of unless
your already a part of it.
ADS: Right. In the South Ken'
hustings, you said that opposing top-
up fees was one of your main priori-
ties. How will you achieve this?
CB: I'm not in a position to fully
understand what the whole issue is
but I will do everything I can to
ensure that top-up fees don't hap-
pen, because then I believe that peo-
ple will becoming to College on the
basis of how much money they have
opposed to what sort of people they
are and how qualified they are.
ADS: OK, you said that this was
one of your main priorities, so how
will you actually do it?
Clare Bunston and New
Election face the grand
inquisitor, Andrew
Dorman-Smith, to per-
suade us why we should
vote for them.
CB: Until I'm in that position, I
don't really know enough about it,
I'm afraid.
ADS: So you can't tell us how you
are going to achieve one of your
main priorities?
CB: Well, I would argue as best I
could. I think that it is the general
consensus of opinion is that top-up
fees wouldn't be good for the future.
ADS: On the NUS, do you think
there should be a referendum as to
whether Imperial College views are
expressed through the NUS?
CB: Yeah.
ADS: So you will carry out a refer-
endum in your next year as presi-
dent?
CB: Only if that was felt to be the
consensus of opinion. It doesn't
really matter what I believe as a per-
son, it's just I have to consult other
people and get the general feeling
ADS: But you'll be the President of
Imperial college...
CB: NO, 'cos even though your the
president, you mustn't just...I can't
just make decisions just because I
am the president, its important that I
have got the information to make
these decisions from my colleagues.
ADS: OK, You've talked a lot
about St Mary's both at their own
hustings and at here. I'm a City &
Guilds student, what can you offer
me to get your vote?
CB: I'm not trying to offer certain
people certain things to get their
vote, I don't work like that.
ADS: But it seems that you work
like that with St Mary's.
CB: No, not at all, that's just
because I've had a lot of feedback
from the St Mary's people.
ADS: Well you've promised St
Mary's their funds will be kept, they
will keep their bar, can you promise
City & Guilds a bar?
CB: No, because you've never
wanted one before. Why should you
get so upset about it?
ADS: I'm merely illustrating the
point that you seem to be promising
rather a lot to St Mary's and very
little to South Kensington.
Voting in all departments on Monday 19th
and Tuesday 20th May. For details of how
to vote, see box on page four.
