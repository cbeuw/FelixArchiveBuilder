The election for next
year's ICU President
moves on a stage with
the hustings and inter-
view this week. Page 2.
Hustings reveal muddle
JITEN PATEL
At this week's Imperial College
Union Presidential hustings at St
Mary's and dBs the sole candidate
Clare Bunstan was grilled intensively
with the main topic of the meetings
being the impending merger of IC
with the medical schools.
At a tame St Mary's hustings on
Tuesday, Clare was asked many
times how she would handle the inte-
gration of the two unions and their
students. Her answers seemed to rep-
resent the general consensus of opin-
ion of the medics saying that "the
Mary's clubs and societies will stay
independent, and if they want to
merge with their ICU counterparts
then they can."
Questions were raised over the
possibility of a centralised bar man-
ager who would run all the bars of
ICU, which would include the bar at
the Mary's site, was one that brought
up a many different views, most of
which were her own. When first
questioned, she was in favour of the
proposed system noting that "we can
learn from each other" about how to
run the services, but when the medics
stated that "we don't want it" Clare
seemed to be lost for words and then
replied that maybe the bar could be
run by the medics. When later asked
by Piers Williams, the current
Deputy President for Finance &
Services, "how easy will it be to run
the bar once all the administration of
Mary's SU moves to ICU after next
year?", she commented on the need
of some kind of centralised system,
changing her mind for the second
time. When questioned about her
views of the "apparent Mary's block
vote", Clare replied "they (medics)
seem to have a feel for the union"
and that "they just choose wisely."

Security
call in the
dogs
MARIA IOANNOU
Dog patrols are set to become a com-
mon sight on campus with Imperial
College Security taking new mea-
sures in an attempt to clamp down on
crime. The majority of the handlers
will be trained during July and the
patrols should be fully operational by
August.
Dog patrols were introduced at
Clayponds earlier this year as an
emergency measure in.an attempt to
put a stop to what was described by
Ken Weir, Chief Security Officer at
IC, as a "mini crimewave". "It has
definitely worked in the case of
Clayponds" commented Mr Weir,
"where we were once having at least
three crimes a week reported to us,
after installing the dog patrols we
have only had three crimes reported
to us since November." Mr Weir
added that it was a financially sound
proposal "to have the same effect as
one dog you would need two or pos-
sibly three security officers."
According to Mr Weir, "it is the
deterrent value of the dog patrols that
is most effective in reducing crime,
although professional thieves plan
for dogs, opportunist thieves, who
for us pose the biggest problem, tend
not to go up against dogs. The
implied threat of being caught by a
security officer with a dog acts as a
deterrent to the criminal fraternity."
The imminent merger of the vari-
ous medical bodies also, Mr Weir
feels, provides an argument for
bringing in the dogs, "As from the
1st of August, making sure that
merger sites, like the National Heart
and Lung Institute and St Marys
