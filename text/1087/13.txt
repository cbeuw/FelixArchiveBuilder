F E L I X FRIDAY 1 6 T H M A Y COLUMNS 13
You are a beastly lot! Saying all
those nasty things about Ian
Caldwell. Yes, I'm talking to you,
Neil Forsyth. I think you slightly
overstepped the mark by suggesting
that he has no brain. I have had the
pleasure of his company and can
confirm not only evidence of cere-
bral activity, but also that the man
has a lot of very interesting things to
say. Don't get me wrong Imperial,
I'm not apologising for the tent fias-
co or for M r C's occasional short-
comings (for examples see the last 2
years of Felix). Certainly not, but
softly softly, catchey monkey. I
don't want to spend too long with the
tent this week (like most members of
Chemistry and Physics), since I plan
to cover it and 'related topics' in the
next issue. Let me just say that no
one at IC, and I really do mean no
one, has persuaded me that this is
anything other than a cock of
immense proportions, the result of
misplaced priorities.
Speaking of cockups, it was disap-
pointing to hear of the demise of
A B A Copytech barely five minutes
after it opened. Though I must admit
I hardly noticed it, let alone used its
facilities, the idea seemed, I thought,
to be a bit shaky. Almost all of what
it offered could be obtained from
e s t a b l i s h e d
sources around
the College, but
apparently this
was not the
problem. It was
not our end that
fell flat on its
face. Being the
arch cynic that I
am, I wrongly
assumed that
Finance sold
A B A a dummy,
which could
have had nasty
repercussions
for the various
planned ven-
tures around the
campus. Phew
what a relief. Ah,
hang on a minute. Is it not normal
practice to run checks on companies
before one enters into an agreement
with them, so as to avoid being left
holding the baby. Does IC not use
the much-respected Dunn and
Bradstreet for this purpose? Some
careless Cafe Express customer mut-
tered in earshot that they were not
, , used in this
Simon Baker c a s e . shUreiy
shome mish-
take? If they
were, questions
need to be
asked over the
credit agency. If
not, someone in
the Finance
Division may
care to inform
us as to why.
Whatever the
case, it con-
firms my belief
that any
attempts to
build on the
i n c r e d i b l y
shaky, but con-
siderable, foun-
dations of Sherfield are doomed to
failure. I know that businesses fold
for a variety of reasons, sometimes at
short notice, but this has shambles
scrawled all over it. I cannot believe
voice of r e a s o n
that this misfortune would have hap-
pened if proper procedures and due
diligence checks had been carried
out. Invariably in business, nasty sur-
prises are precisely that, the result of
not doing your homework properly.
Given the planned changes over the
next few years, please tell me that
I've got it all wrong, Mike Hansen.
And finally, a new departure. Ever
keen to tend to your every need, dear
reader, I thought that it was about
time that I offered my assistance in
planning those sad moments when
one finds oneself away from
Imperial. That said, even IC's most
loyal subjects need a break every
now and then, and for the first in this
occasional series, I suggest Istanbul.
What better than to escape from the
stench of the lab or the drudgery of
Southside basement at the end of
week and spend a few days in the
mystical city where East meets West.
Flights are available from Â£89,
though I understand that some peo-
ple have been able to negotiate much
better deals recently. A truly marvel-
lous place. You will send a postcard
if you go, won't you?
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
hings move so
quickly these
days, especially in
Parliament. Labour's
spectacular majority
seems to be going to
some ministers' heads already: Prescott joked that
the building for the Institute of Civil Engineers
"couldn't takes our majority". Gordon Brown has
been criticised for giving independence to the
Bank of England without seeking the permission
of Parliament first. Of course a new Government is
expected to make its mark quickly, and Labour
has, starting a number of fresh initiatives already.
But it must remember the difference between
Government and Parliament.
For those who are unsure, the difference is fair-
ly simple. People are elected as Members of
Parliament by constituencies around the United
Kingdom, and those MPs may then sit and speak
in the Commons, and also vote on any legislation
coming through it. There are no technical restric-
tions on which side an M P may vote for. MPs have
a duty to their constituents to examine bills and
scrutinise their content, for which they receive an
allowance to hire researchers. In practice, MPs
take 'the whip' of a particular party when they
arrive in the House, and are expected (but do not
always) vote in line with their party's wishes. The
leader of the party controlling a majority of MPs
is then invited to form a government by the Queen.
He or she then selects ministers - usually from
Parliament, but not always - to run the
Government. The Government does all the run-
ning of the country, whereas Parliament makes the
laws within which the Government must work.
The Government cannot make law, it can be sued
like any other organisation, and its decisions can
be overruled by a judge. Parliament however is
supreme (setting aside the European dimension),
and cannot be sued or 'argued with' in any way. A
decision from Parliament comes from its mem-
bers, not from the Government.
A dangerous tone was being emitted by the new
Minister Without Portfolio, Peter Mandelson (pre-
viously Labour's spin-doctor-in-chief) when
bluntly stated "Labour Members of Parliament
have been elected to carry out the manifesto for
which we have received an overwhelming man-
date from the public." This is broadly true, and
Labour MPs would be wise not to attempt to
undermine Labour's central pledges. But MPs
who blindly followed what party elders told them
may as well be replaced by robots for all the use
they will be to anyone. Not all manifestoes are per-
fect, and Labour will naturally wish to introduce
legislation on other areas in their five year term.
This is where things may become worrying.
Already the party have introduced disciplinary
procedures for MPs who bring it into 'disrepute'.
This heavy-handedness at the top of the party is
anti-democratic and dangerous for anyone, what-
ever their political allegiance. Already Mr Blair
announced the change in Prime Minister's ques-
tions from two 15 minute sessions to one 30
minute session per week, something that was
specifically rejected by the Procedure Committee
(which is part of Parliament) recently. Other ideas
espoused by reformers is to change the shape of
the seating in the Commons from the opposing
pews to a horseshoe shape, like many other
Parliaments, since they apparently don't like the
atmosphere created by this 'confrontational'
arrangement (it didn't seem much of a problem
when opposing the Government). Some MPs are
calling for swift action, in order to have the
changes pushed through before the summer recess.
Quite apart from the abhorrent idea that some
naive reformers could change 400 years of tradi-
tion in a few weeks, with no discernible benefits, I
hope the Labour Party have a long think before
diving headlong into fundamentally altering the
whole way Parliament works.
