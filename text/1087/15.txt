LETTERS TO FELIX
Felix out of turn
Dear Alex,
I would like to comment on your
whimsical cartoon regarding Ian
Caldwell in issue 1083 at the end of
last term. I've been associated with
the College for 16 years as an under-
graduate/ postgraduate/ tutor/ war-
den/ union official/ employee, and as
such have had numerous contacts
with Felix both on and off the record.
I therefore feel well qualified to
make the following comment.
Felix should be a voice of our stu-
dents who, at times, are right to ques-
tion the way their College is run.
Felix should be enjoyable and there-
fore satire is not out of place. The
blatant attack on an Administrative
Director is certainly 'fair game'.
However, to stoop to the depths of
personally insulting someone who,
according to previous issues, may
not be perfect but is certainly hon-
ourable, open and dedicated to
improving the student environment,
is unlikely to endear you to your
readers.
I enjoy reading a Felix which is
controversial and outspoken; I am
less impressed with one that ducks
the real problems and purely focuses
on taking the piss out of a very
decent bloke who is not only hard-
working and extremely talented but
who, most importantly, is loyal to the
College.
Regards
Ken Young
In this case I would agree with you
that Ian Caldwell loo roll is proba-
bly going too far... though I think
the 'honourable, open and dedicat-
ed' picture given in previous issues
provides balance to this particular
example.
poll: taxing
Dear Sir,
I may be not be a Student of
Imperial College, but I felt that I sim-
ply had to write to congratulate
David Roberts on the worst election
poll in history. Well done, David.
Keep up the good work.
Yourfaithfully,
Chris Coote, Warwick University
From what I've seen of your own
effort, Warwick Boar, I wouldn't
shout too loudly, but I'm glad to
see that Felix gets so far.
hustings moan
Dear Felix,
After just coming out of the ICU
Presidential Hustings held in dBs, I
cannot believe the lack of basic
knowledge displayed by the candi-
date.
When asked a question on whether
or not ICU should disaffiliate from
the NUS, the first response was yes,
until the candidate realised that ICU
is not a part of the NUS. Given the
large majority of students who voted
against re-joining the NUS 2 years
ago, such a large oversight by a pres-
idential candidate, clearly shows that
they are not in touch with the overall
feeling at Imperial, or reality!
Also, is someone who, at the ICU
Hustings, said "Blokes are cunts", an
appropriate candidate for ICU
President, given that approximately
70% of I C U is composed of
"blokes"? - by the way, I would
expect that someone on a Biology
and Management course would
understand that this is physically
impossible!

I've been here for four years, and I
can assure you that there are a lot
of "cunts" about Brian. However,
whatever Ms Bunston's academic
abilty, I am sure she is able by now
to place them, if isolated first.
From what I can recall of the
NUS referendum, the turnout was
poor, at about 1500. That would
leave approximately 6000 students
who didn't register their opinion
or didn't know about it. So, per-
haps Ms Bunston is, by her self-
confessed ignorance, a better rep-
resentative than given credit for.
Letters may edited for content or length. The deadline for letters for

I would like to invite you to join me
on a trip to another world, where
someone is speaking in a marquee
(possibly rigid-sided):
"...have a greater resentment at
being unseatedfrom what we see as
our home (in a physical and, for
want of a better word, spiritual
sense) and have felt quite strongly
over thisfor some years."
The camera moves slightly from
the back of the tent, rising above the
rows of applauding students, bring-
ing the speaker into view.
"The to-ing andfro-ingofvictori-
ous claims and bitter rebukes..."
The viewpoint drifts off up toward
the podium and the speech fades into
the background. The fer-de-lis
emblem on the front of the lectern is
royal purple on white.
"...However, the headline was
"Medics secure independence"
which, in a couple of areas we have
done, but this story was seen as 'a
stirring story of triumph in the face
of adversity.' I believe that this
imminent change, in one way or
another, scares or worries every one
ofus..."
We pan down to look at the tran-
script in one of the audience's lap:
"However, to go on accusing us
of being 'selfish' is simply short-
sighted. Of course we are being self-
ish. We are being uprooted against
our wills and, whilst we realise that
without the move, we would have a
very short life-expectancy indeed,
we are merely trying to ensure that
despite the geographical changes,
little else about what is a fantastic
place (though it does, of course,
have its weaknesses) alters percepti-
bly."
The speaker drones on.
"...To criticise us directly for tak-
ing away from the members of ICU
is a pointless twisting offact. We are
not 'a room full of baying medical
students' anymore than ICU stu-
dents are a University of simpering
apathetics. We are simply concerned
to do everything within our power to
make ICSM a worthy successor."
The crowd are beginning to tire,
sense that the orator was on the
home straight. He continued:
"...A couple of weeks after this, a
letter was written that attempted to
put forward our point of view.
Unfortunately, this letter slipped
down the unproductive slope of
being aggressive and confrontation-
al. For several years now, 'St
Mary's xenophobia', a trait particu-
lar to all London Medical Schools,
has extended to IC. I have already
skimmed the surface of why this has
occurred, but I don't believe that
this is something that we should be
rapidly trying to unravel. It is, for
the most part purely posturing and
serves our fierce pride, but it is our
fierce pride that drives us to ourfan-
tastic achievements."
The marquee starts to whistle and
cheer.
"This is just one debate of many
to come and it is important to realise
that aggressive triumphalism is not
wanted at IC any more than snide
jealousy and resentment are
received over here. This whole
process is inevitable and, as far as
we are concerned, we will continue
to obtain everything that we reason-
ably can."
The speaker sits down to thunder-
ous applause. The camera snaps
back to reality, which makes less
sense, frankly. These are extracts
from Marmalade Sandwich, St
Mary's magazine. Discuss.
