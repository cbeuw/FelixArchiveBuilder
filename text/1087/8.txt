p The Foo Fighters have got
^ 4 a new album out entitled The
* Colour And The Shape which was
released on Monday. Primal Scream are
soon to confirm a number of big tent shows
over summer. They look set to take place in
Glasgow on August 2, Hackney Victoria Park
on August 9 and 10 and near Dublin Castle on
either August 16 or 17. This year's Music
Industry Soccer Six is to be held at Fulham's
Craven Cottage ground on May 18. Among
those playing will be The Prodigy, Symposium,
Robbie Williams and Blur. The Tindersticks
release a new album, Curtains in mid June and
Spiritualised are set to release a new LP,
THE LEVELLERS
Brixton Academy .
So, they've been around the block a few times
now, and after four albums and many more
years playing their politically motivated
anthems in support of such noble causes as
travellers' rights and social justice you might
have thought that they
were beginning to tire.
OK, so they don't tour as
much as they used to
and they don't sell more T-
P^fij'i'Ushirts than
I L L ^ L J r e c o r d s any-
more, a feat only
matched by total
T-shirt mer-
chants like Neds and
Carter. They aren't exactly
adorning the front covers
of music publications any-
more either, but they still
manage to fill the 5000
capacity Academy to the
brim.
There's quite a mixed
bunch here tonight, you've
got your hard-core
crusties, dreads and
German paras to boot
and the older loyal fans
who have returned to
experience the full
onslaught of the Levs live. Scattered around are
also groups of the so called 'kids'.
The timing of this gig couldn't have been bet-
ter, coming as it did the same day we all dis-
covered that a new Labour government was in

Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In
Space, on May 26. Look out for the review in
next week's Felix.
Tomorrow, May 17 will see musical goings-
on up and down the country to raise funds for
the National Missing Persons Helpline
(NMPH) under the banner of WHERE ARE YOU?
These happenings will include three London
events with all proceeds going to this chronical-
ly underfunded but vital organisation. The
NMPH is a charity that gives support to families
of the 250,000 people who, for what ever rea-
son go missing in the UK every year. They give
priority to the most vulnerable cases- the sick,
the young and the old and the distressed, rely-
L I V E
charge. Inevitably when they came on , the first
act of celebration was to give a verbal two fin-
gered salute to that nice man Michael Portillo.
The songs from Levelling The Land provoke
the greatest response from
the crowd, the jaunty
Boatman and Another
Man's Cause cause helpless
uncontrollable sing-alongs
and The Riverflow initiates a
frenzied passionate mosh
along with the obligatory
shouts of 'Oil' thrown in. A
few oldies come up like
Carry Me though they steer
clear of their Levellers
album. One Way with its
poignant message of basi-
cally, choose your own way
of life, drains the energy out
of even the most apathetic
members in the room, and
thankfully a slow acoustic
number follows.
Exit the Levellers, and
Renter for the first encore.
Exit, then back again for
encore number two. Still not
had enough they are back
again for a third, opening
with the revolution inciting Subvert and to think
that Blair and co. had only just about stepped
through the doorway of number 10.

adults or young people who do not want to go
home can send a message to lei their families

The musical goings mentioned are The
Charlatans playing an all nighter gig at The
Brixton Academy with plenty of special guests
including Monaco and James Dean Bradfield
(Monies lead singer bloke). Also at The
Borderline there will be a special acoustic night
featuring Mark Moriss (lead singer bloke from
the Bluetones) and Hurricane No. 1. All pro-
ceeds will go to NMPH.
