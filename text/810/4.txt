Victorian houses with three floors,
accommodating around 40 students.
Mr Smith told FELIX that the:
property was ideally suited to the
college's'needs since it has been
used as a hostel and offers
immediate occupation, although
some work will be required in the
kitchen areas. The work will take a
month or so, during which students
will be given meal vouchers for use
in the college refectories. He went
on to say that he had discarded
several other properties, which were
not suitable for immediate use. Mr
Smith added that the college is also;
planning to purchase a further;
property for £400,000 on a similar!
financial basis, in time for next term.
The hostel on Chelsea Bridge Road
is part of a converted nurses home
and will house 12 students. Mr
Smith hopes to have exchanged
contracts by the end of this week.
He said 'People are always accusing
me of not taking risks, and now I'm
taking one.'He hopes that the
financial situation for the new I
purchases 'should look reasonable' j
after three to five years.
New mag
'London Student', the magazine of
the University of London Union will
be relaunched this October.
Its new editor, Jane Headon,
promises a completely redesigned,
thicker publication with wider and
fuller News, Sport and Arts pages
and Travel pages designed 'much
more with the student traveller in
mind.'
New loo
After a break-in at 9 Princes Gardens
the college has decided to rethink its
security arrangements for the
Northside of Princes Gardens. The
house contains postgraduate flats,1
one of which had £200 worth of1
jewelery and camera equipment'
stolen from it on Tuesday night.
Two other unoccupied flats were
also broken into. Security Officer,
Terry Briley told FELIX that workers
from Nightline had left a basement
door in 9 Princes Gardens open that
night.
The college plans to install a
separate toilet for the West London
Chaplaincy. At present, members of
the Chaplaincy use the Garden Hall
facilities. The new toilet will allow
the rest of the hall to be isolated
from the basement.
Juke-box jury
A new juke-box has been installed
in the Union Lounge Bar and Snack
Bar area and the Imperial College
Radio speakers have been removed.
The move has been a cause for
complaint from Imperial College
Radio. Station manager, Nigel
Whitfield, said 'It would have been
nice if we'd known something about
it.'
Mr Whitfield told FELIX that the
loss of the snack bar as a
broadcasting area would lead to a
reduction in the number of listeners
and a fall in their complimentary
record income.
IC Radio received 300 free records
from companies last year but the
figure has been declining for several
Computer thefts
continue unchecked
years.
Chas Brereton, ICU Deputy
President, told FELIX that he felt IC
Radio should be able to broadcast in
the snack bar 'under the control of
the Snack Bar and Bar Manager'.
ICU Hon Sec lan Morris admitted
that the Union had 'been a bit
stupid' and had not entered into
talks with IC Radio before the move.
He went on to suggest that the juke-
box could be converted to allow IC
Radio to broadcast when the juke-
box is not in operation. He added
that the juke-box will be re-stocked
with four or five new Chart singles
per week which could go to IC
Radio.
Further computer thefts from
departments around the college
have continued to baffle the college
security forces, despite an outside
police presence.
Two computers were stolen from
the Mechanical Engineering
department on Wednesday night.
Later that evening, two people were
challenged in the Royal School of
Mines and fled leaving a computer
box from the Mechanical
Engineering department. They are
described as a Filipino or Italian,
male accompanied by a thin female.
More computer equipment valued
at £5500 was stolen on August 31
from the Mineral Resources
Engineering department. Security
Officer, Terry Briley told FELIX that
a computer had been left unlocked
after a late evening's work. He went
on to say that 'We probably, have
continued in next column
more than one suspect. This is a two
man job.'
The college central administration
has put forward funds for better
locks and hopes departments will
add to this. Mr Briley told FELIX
that he hoped to install magnetic
locks on fire doors throughout the
departments and added that a lock
was due to be installed upon the fire
door to the Royal School of Mines.
The locks are of a type which
releases in the event of a fire and
cost £1000-£2000.
The college had arranged for a
small squad of police officers to
patrol the college over a two week
period. The plan met with little
success however, since the squad
was called away three nights out of
four. Mr Briley hopes to be able to
arrange further police surveillance
in the future.
Obituary
Prof Alan Bishop 1920-1988
Dept of Civil Engineering 1946-1980
Prof Alan Bishop died suddenly at
his home in Whitstable on 30 June
1988, while recovering from heart
surgery.
He graduated from Cambridge in
1942 and joined the College in 1946
from the Metropolitan Water Board,
the first recruit to the Soil Mechanics
School started by A W Skepton. He
became Reader in Soil Mechanics in
1957, and Professor of Soil
Mechanics in 1965. His early
retirement in 1980 followed a
prolonged period of ill-health.
He made a notable contribution to
the subject of soil mechanics
particularly to the understanding
and use of the principle of effective
stress. An expert experimentalist, he
designed and, in the early days,
made his own soil testing apparatus.
Equipment of his design was used
worldwide and still operates in most
laboratories.
As head of the soil mechanics
section he took a keen interest in the
welfare of his staff and students,
and was Dean of City & Guilds
College from 1970-73. He was a well
known international figure in his
subject, being the third Briton to
give the annual Rankine Lecture on
Geotechnical Engineering at the
Institute of Civil Engineers. He was
consulted on many engineering
problems, and led the team of
investigators into the causes of the
Aberfyn disaster in South Wales in
October 1966.
