Dear Bill
Two statements in your lead story
about Silwood Park in FELIX of 12
August surprise me. The College
has not announced its intention to
convert Silwood House into a
conference centre and the Biology
Department has certainly not been
moved into new buildings to make
room for the centre.
At the time of the 198C/81
reduction in Government funding
of universities the College had to
decide whether to dispose of
Silwood Park or develop its
potential. Governors decided on
development which involved a long
negotiation with the planning
authorities. The first stage of the
programme was the technology
transfer centre to meet government
objectives for the universities, to
enlarge the scientific community, to
share the heavy overheads of huge
parkland and to produce income.
With the same motivation,!
arrangements were made to providej
a site for the Commonwealth
Institute for Biological Control and
the library of the Commonwealth
Institute for Entymology. With this
boost it was possible to realise the
long felt needs of the Biology
Department to bring together its
own two groups, one based at
Silwood House and the other at
Ashurst Lodge. Governors agreed
to the sale of Ashurst Lodge to
finance the new Garden Wood
Laboratories which will be fully
occupied by the end of the autumn
term. Sandyride House, which
provided accommodation for eleven
students and their families, has also
been sold and replaced with a block
of six flats and a block of sixteen
single rooms alongside the
Southwood Halls.
With the successful completion of
these developments the next need
is the improvement of the catering
and recreation facilities for the
enlarged community. This larger
community provides the
opportunity because there is no
public fund support for catering or
residence. What we are now doing
is looking at the main Silwood
House to see how it can be
refurbished to provide the focal
social point for Silwood Park. With
the freeing of space formerly used
as offices and laboratories there is
the possibility of transferring the
refectory from the wartime huts
where it is poorly housed at present.
Company tenants are looking for a
boardroom type lunch service for
which there would be room. This
kind of service provides a subsidy
to the student side of catering which
cannot be provided at low prices just
during term time without other
business to help cover overheads.
Apart form improved catering
facilities, common rooms and
teaching space Silwood House will
also be able to provide bedrooms to
improve existing conference
accommodation. There is nothing
new about conferences at Silwood
Park. Space pressures have made it
much more difficult to mount them
in recent years and some, like the
student Touchstone weekends,
have long since gone altogether. We
now have an opportunity to build
up the business alongside providing
better accommodation for both full-
time students and short course
students.
The College has asked Martin
Parsons to transfer to Silwood Park
to provide professional skill in
developing the social and
recreational facilities. No work can
be undertaken without a business
plan which shows that a loan
financed project can be effectivly
serviced. At the end of the day
everyone there, not least the
students, will enjoy far better
amenities than at present. The price
which has to be paid is the good
management of resources, which
has enabled recent development to
take place. Those who hanker after
the good old days of rustic calm
with research being carried out in
wooden huts and South Kensington
as remote as another planet need to
recollect that but for the changes
which have taken place there would
be no Silwood Park.
Yours sincerely,
John Smith, College Secretary.

Set against the backdrop of the
Pakistan/Afghan border, Sylvester
Stallone proves that there is still life
after Rocky, albeit slightly brain-
damaged. Drawn out of retirement
in a Buddhist monastery by the
capture of his lifelong buddy and ex-
commanding officer, 'John' takes on
the whole Russian army aided only
by an obnoxious Afghan rebel called
Hamid.
The film is based on a Rambo vs
Russia game of hide and seek.
Rambo breaks into the crack Russian
fortress, imparts some gratuitous
violence, then breaks out, only to
break in again when the Russians
are looking for him in the desert.
With his diminutive ally he shows
that Americans firing stolen
Kalashnikovs are far superior to
trained Russian commanders with
the same weapon: if this is how the
Russians shoot, World War 3 will be
a walkover for NATO. Rambo 3 is
exactly what you'd expect Rambo 3
to be. See it if you want some light
entertainment. It's a shame
Perestroika made it even more
incredible than it was meant to be.
