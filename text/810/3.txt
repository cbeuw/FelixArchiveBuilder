Silwood. The College Secretary,
John Smith is quite right to point out
the error in FELIX's coverage of the
Silwood Park Conference Centre in
issue 808. The College have not an-
nounced their decision to build a
conference centre at Silwood. Far
from it, the matter has been kept as
quiet as possible.
The Students at Silwood have every
right to be concerned about their
future. They have been told little or
nothing officially and the rumours
and half truths which have been cir-
culating offer little consolation. They
are not the only one's who have
been kept in the dark; the College's
Trade Unions have been trying to
find out the facts for a long time,
with little success. I spent the best
part of a week trying to weedle out
the truth about Silwood.
I am not suggesting that there is
anything sinister about the Silwood
development, but I think that the
College ought to ask itself whether
its Colonial closed door style of
management is appropriate to a
modern institution. Does the Col-
lege really have anything to fear by
being open ?

or, preferably, overnight. So, mix
together everything except the fat
and puff pastry and leave in a large
casserole dish, cover and place in
the fridge.
After marinating, remove the
meat and heat the oil in a frying pan

The Wines of
Burgundy
The Burgundy region embraces
six easily identifiable and separate
regions: Chablis; Cote de Nuits;
Cote de Beaune; Cote Chalonnaise;
Maconnaise and Beaujolais. Local
conditions (weather and soil) give
rise to a great variety of wines.
Chablis is made from the
Chardonnay grape, and is relatively
expensive due to the small quantity
of it actually produced (compared to
other wines.) Much of the available
produce is exported to the UK or
USA. A good fine white wine, this
is recommended!
Cote de Nuits and Cote de Beaune
together form the Cote d'Or a first
class region producing mainly red
wines. These, especially wines from
Cote de Nuits, are regarded as
amongst the finest in the world.
Famous names include Chambertin
meat for about 4 minutes until
sealed. Replace in the casserole.
Cook in a cool oven (150°C) for
about 3Vi hours, stirring
occasionally. More water may be
needed towards the end of the
cooking time, the liquid in the
casserole should be the consistency
of thick gravy.
Roll out the puff pastry and cut
into the approximate number of
pieces and bake in a hot oven
(200°C) until golden brown—follow
the instructions on the packet.
Spoon out the casserole into bowls
or onto plates and place the pastry
on top just before serving. Potatoes
and a green vegetable such as
runner beans or mange tout make
a pleasant accompaniment to
Guinness Pie.
A full red wine such as Cabernet
Sauvignon would be suitable to
drink with this dish.
Glossary
Marinate—to steep meat or fish in a
mixture of wine, vinegar, oil, herbs,
etc.
Seai(meat)—to brown and cook the
surface, leaving the meat red (rare)
inside.
and Richebourg. Cote de Beaune
also produces a small quantity of
first class white wines. These are
amazing, but correspondingly
wallet mangling.
Cote Chalonnaise produces
powerful red wines, lighter than
those of Cote de Beaune. The white
wines are firm and dry and many of
them are sparkling.
Maconnais principally produces
an agreeable white wine made from
the Chardonnay grape. However,
Macon Rouge, produced from Pinot
and Gamay grapes, is a magic wine,
and thoroughly drinkable.
The most sizeable region of
Burgundy, Beaujolais, is a truly
prolific one. The Gamay grapes
produce a wine that should be
'guzzled' within the year...sounds
good to me!
