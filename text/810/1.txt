College gamble
on new hall
The college has purchased a new student residence in Earls Court to house
about 40 students next term. College Secretary, John Smith exchanged
contracts last Friday for the former Girl Guides Hostel, Olave House.
Mr Smith hopes that part of the loan by securing funds from other
£1.6 million cost of the purchase will
be met by the Sherfield Trust, with
the balance of around £1.3 million
to be financed by a loan. The
Sherfield Trust is legally
independent of the college and is
administered by a group of trustees,
mostly made up of the college's
governors. Mr Smith is the secretary
of the trust.
The £1.6 million bid was referred
to the Charities Commission a
month ago since the Girl Guides
Association is a registered charity,
and was returned last week. The
purchase has been described as 'a
gamble' by Mr Smith and Senior
Assistant Finance Officer, Malcolm
Aldridge.
Mr Smith told FELIX that students
living in the new house would have
to pay £100 per week to cover the
loan interest and this was not
feasible. Rents will be set at around
£ 5 5 per week, with interest
accumulating upon the original
loan. Mr Smith hopes to reduce the
trusts. Mr Aldridge told FELIX that
if this fails the loan capital will
continue to increase at a hopefully
lower rate than the property value
rise. The £1.6 million bid for the
property was tendered when
interest rates were lower than at
present and property values in
central London were rising at a
higher rate.
The contract for the purchase of
Olave House will be completed on
30th September, after which the
hostel will be ready for immediate
use by the student accommodation
office. Mr Smith stressed that the
cost of the purchase would not be
transferred to students outside
Olave House, in line with the
college's agreement with former
ICU President, Christine Taig. The
College agreed not to transfer the
cost of any further purchases to the
overall students residence account
after the purchase of Fisher Hall.

Geology slams
UGC review
Following their review of Earth
Sciences, the University Grants
Committee have instructed
Imperial's Geology department to
[reduce its quota of staff and
| students. The department has been
| told to lose 10 academic staff and 13
non—academic staff and to reduce
jits annual undergraduate intake
;from 45 to 32. As part of the UGC's
jrequirements, the department has
Ibeen 'reorganised' into teaching and
research divisions. The UGC's
decision has come under heavy fire
Ifrom academics within Geology.
The academics are critical of the
jUGC's alleged use of the Science
Citation Index as a means of
assessing the quantity of research
carried out at Imperial. They argue
that the index does not take into
account many of the journals which
publish the work from applied
Geology Departments such as
Imperial. They also point out that
much of the work carried out by the
department is for industry and
hence is not available for open
publication.
Head of the Geology Department,
Dr Richard Selley told FELIX that
the department was amongst the
top two or three in the country in
every criterion assessed by the U G C
Committee. 'We were told by a
member of the U G C Committee that
we were subjectively assessed,' he
said. He is critical of the fact that the
Chairman of the regional Earth
Sciences Committee spent only two
hours at the College before the
assessment was made. This is in
sharp contrast to the current U G C
review of Petroleum Engineering
during which the whole committee
visited the department for two days.
"The reviewers were basically
pure academic Geologists and were
reluctant to accept Imperial
College's international status,' he
said.
The U G C ' s stance that the
Geology Department carries out too
much consulatative work has also
FELIX spoke to Professor Mc
Connell, regional chairman of the
Earth Sciences Review Committee.
Professor McConnell told FELIX that
the UGC's decision was based
primarily on a 'bid' made by the
department outlining their plans for
the next ten to fifteen years. 'The
U G C made a complete analysis of
the figures but they weren't
specifically used,' he said.
The bid was made by the
department as part of a detailed
dossier which the Geology
Department submitted to the U G C
at the beginning of the year. The
U G C were unhappy with the bid
and asked for it to be resubmitted
twice. The first draft of the bid called
for moderate increases in staff and
student numbers and equipment.
The revised version outlined the
planned 'restructuring' of the
department into teaching and
research sections.
According to the Department, the
UGC declined to say why they were
unhappy with the bid. 'We didn't
know what we were were bidding
for,' said Dr Selley.
The Rector Professor Eric Ash,
told FELIX that the cutbacks would
be softened by support from
industry. Following a press
conference given by the Rector in
June, industry has sponsored two
lectureships and it is hoped that
more will be forthcoming. 'It is not
at all certain that the numbers of
staff and students will be
decreased,' he said.
