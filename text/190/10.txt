THE SQUASH TEAM
TOUR OF IRELAND
(24th-30th March)
Monday Irish Bankers Club, Dublin. Lost 5-2.
Tuesday Cork Squash Club. Lost 6-1.
Wednesday Guinness Brewery, Dublin. Won 4-3.
Thursday Royal Belfast Golf Club. Lost 5-2.
Friday Crawfordsburn Country Club. Won 5-2.
Saturday Queens University, Belfast. Lost 4-2.
When our last two courts
went up in flames, is was clear
that only one course remained
open to , the Squash Club:
emigration. Consequently, a team
of seven was mustered to' tour
Ireland during the last week in
March. The competant part* of
the team consisted of
one Internationally-famous
Egyptian insect-hunter
one ether Squash player and
the Captain of Tennis.
Endeavouring to support them
was a mixed rabble :—
one Irishman (to speak to the
natives)
one born Guinness-drinker
ane Army Deserter and
one former Naval man, whom
everyone hoped would be sea-
sick.
In order to keep natural
enemies apart, the team was
shipped out in separate boats.
(2 to Belfast, 2 to Dublin and 3
to Dun Laoughie). By some
mirae'e, all managed to rendez-
vous at the girls' hostel in
Dublin where accomodation had
been arranged.
During the course of the next
6 days, we drove 700 miles and
played 6 Squash matches :—
The insect-hunter won all his
matches (naturally), and the
other Squash player won 3 out
of 6. The remainder won either
2 matches or one. Hospitality
after the matches, was in accord-
ance with the best Irish tradit-
ions, and led to many interesting
episodes.
Before leaving Cork, we all
went to kiss the Blarney Stone,
during which operation one
turban fell off into the bushes
far below. Our programme left
little time to spare, but the golf-
ers in the party managed to fit
in 3 rounds of golf, much to the
delight of the sailor who thus
avenged successive squash de-
feats at the hands of the "other
Squash player".
Members of the team were:
Sherif Afifi
Michael Combes
John Richardson
Peter Schofield
Adrian Erskine
Peter Riding
Uppi Anand

Bottle Returns
R.S.M. 11 pts. C.S.M. 0 pts.
This year it was the turn of the
Camborne School of Mines to
come up to London to contest the
" Bottle." The Bottle, a Trophy
competed for annually between
the R.S.M. and the C.S.M., was
last held by Mines in 1958 and
after a narrow defeat by 3 pts. to
all last year the Mines were rar-
ing to go.
A goodly crowd of 100 or so
saw Camborne kick off with the
advantage of a blustery wind and
the sun at their backs. The
play was lively from the start with
Mines using their backs very early
on in the game, but it was evident
that the Camborne backs were
strong in defence. After about a
quarter of an hour's play Mines
went into the lead through a
penalty-try awarded as the result
of some obstruction by the Cam-
borne full-back when caught be-
hind his own line by Jeff Thom-
pson; Cast converted. The Mines
pack was more than holding its
own in the set pieces and territor-
ially seemed to have the game well
in hand. The second half saw
Camborne playing against the
wind and their tactics in dealing
with this situation was to prove to
be their eventual downfall. Rather
than kick their way out of trouble
they preferred to run with the
ball and as a result they never
left their own half for the rest of
the game. The Mines back-row
of Thompson, Turner and Coxall
continually flurried the Camborne
backs into mistakes and the whole
pack played with great fire and
enthusiasm, particularly in the
loose.
Midway through the second half,
a quick heel from a set-scrum just
inside the " 25 " gave Wakelin
enough room for a break and
with the full-back Gardner coming
into the line to make the overlap
Forbes-Jones had an easy run in
for a try which was not con-
verted. Shortly afterwards, from
a set-scrum on the Camborne 5-
yard line the scrum-half, Mar-
shall, made a blind side break and
passed to Forbes-Jones who
scored in the corner to make it
11—0.

So the Bottle returns to the
Mines and on this showing it
looks as if it is here to stay.
SPORTS DAY
It was the wettest Sports Day ever. Most of the Motspur Park track
was covered in half an inch of water, and the conditions caused many of
the events to be cancelled. The hurdling events, tug of war, staff race,
Presidents' net ball match, and the programmed National Anthem did not
take place. This year the bad weather was particularly disappointing as
a match between IC and Gottingen University was held in conjunction
with the intercollegiate competition. The result of the " International"
was never in doubt, Gottingen winning by 86 points to 56. It must be
remembered, in all fairness to IC
that Gottingen is a large Univer-
sity of some ten thousand students,
many of whom specialise in physi-
cal education: the slaughter of IC
was perhaps excusable.
The RCS victory over Guilds
was in doubt up to the last event,
the high jump, which was eventu-
ally won, ironically enough, by
Nicholson, the Mines captain. The
final result — RCS 124 points,
C&G 118, RSM 57.
The first event, the 100 yards,
started almost half an hour late,
the handful of brave supporters
shivering in the stand. Harrison
(RCS) managed to come second
between the two Germans, his time
of 10.5 sees, was but a yard slower
than the winner, but this was no
day for records. Woods the IC
captain, achieved the best IC per-
formance, winning the 440 in 50.2
seconds, one of I C S three victories
over Gottingen. Clifton (RCS),
won an exciting 880 yards by a
couple of yards in the compara-
tively poor time of 2 min. 1.6 sees.,
and Wilkins, the RCS captain, led
nearly all the way, to win the mile
in 4 min. 27.6 sees. The 1500
metres steeplechase was an all IC
affair, and was won by the Guilds
captain, Colvin, in 4 min. 42.6
sees. The field was unfortunately
weakened by the withdrawal of
Mike Harris RCS, who slipped
and hurt his leg while practising
on the wet grass.
The first IC men in the other
events were:
220 yards, Wood, RCS, 23.2 sees.
Long jump, Wade, RCS,
21 ft. 6 ins.
Triple jump.
Pole vault, Asekun, Mines,
9 ft. 6 ins.
Javelin, Martin, Guilds.
Discus, Williams, Guilds,
105 ft. 6 ins.
Shot, White, Guilds, 36 ft.
GOLF
That little college off High
Street Ken. who knocked IC out of
the U L Rugby and Hockey Cups
has been at it again. Last Wednes-
day, they thrashed a weakened IC
Golf Team by four matches to nil,
halving one. Its QUALITY that
counts.
