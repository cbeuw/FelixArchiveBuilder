LETTER OF THE WEEK!
Occult Science Exchange Bureau,
London, S.W.I.
Dear Sir/Madam,
I shall be much obliged to re-
ceive details of your magazine
" Felix."
Yours faithfully,
S. MENAHENY,
Secretary.
Dear Sir,
I am a member of Imperial
College staff at 178 Queens Gate,
and I will be getting married in
June. Because of bad weather, our
accommodation will not be ready
till the end of August, and since
this period falls during the College
Summer vac, I was wondering
whether any students would be
willing to rent us their furnished
accommodation while away on ex-
peditions or holidays. Period re-
quired is 23 June to end of August.
Yours sincerely,
PENELOPE M. NICE.

l.C. CHOIR
The performance of Verdi's
Requiem by the I.C. Choir at the
end of last term was a pleasant
surprise for one who has had
little to do with this society. It is
reputed that the I.C. students at-
tempt to broaden their outlook
ouside the realms of science and
one tangible proof of this lies in
a creditable college choir.
Few amateur choirs in the
country would choose to perform
such a difficult work in one of the
leading music colleges knowing
that during the Easter period at
least one professional choir was
attempting this work. The
soloists, all from the National
Opera School rose to the occasion
and the charming Ruth Little
gave a warm interpretation of the
mezzo-soprano part. David
Read, the bass, was reminiscent
of Christoff as Phillipe in Don
Carlos, maintaining his tone
throughout the range of his part.
Gabriel Trujillo clearly appealed
to the ladies around me and his
rather thin tenor voice carried
through the full choir and orches-
tra surprising well.
Full credit must be given to the
conductor, Eric Brown, who de-
voted most of his energies during
the performance to the orchestra,
for training the choir to such a
high degree of accuracy and re-
liability. The choir tended to be
dominated by the female voices
particularly during the Dies Irae
and Sanctus. The basses lacked
the sonority essential to the har-
mony of the Lux Aeterna but
they did succeed with the fine
Lacrymosa which ended the first
half. The tenors fared well but
were short of numbers.
The performance was not tech-
nically perfect but the overall
effect was very pleasing. It was
obvious that members of I.C.
Choir enjoy their singing and the
audience was not slow to appre-
ciate this.
E D U C A T I O N EDUCATION
EDUCATION
Just out in your racks last week
is a questionnaire devised by a
group here at I.C. investigating
the advice system in schools.
With the help of Tyrrel Burgess
of " New Society " and of advice
from a research student at the
L.S.E., the questionnaire is going
out to a 1 in 3 sample of all
Freshmen at I.C., U.C. and
L.S.E.
Breaking fresh ground, this
survey is large enough to deter-
mine the quality of advice given
by each different type of school,
State-Maintained, Direct Grant
and Independent.
In a pilot survey, conducted
last December, Maintained
schools were found to be best;
but even on such an elementary
point as availability of Careers
Masters, in only half of the
schools was he freely available for
discussion.
English Electric have loaned us
computer time free, so long as the
information is transferred to
punched cards by the end of May.
So if you have received a ques-
tionnaire, help us by completing it
quickly and returning it in good
time. Thank you.
