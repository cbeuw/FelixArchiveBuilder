FIRE AT I.C
At lunchtime on Monday, a
fire was discovered in the 'in-
ert' part of the Nuclear Tech-
nology Lab., just behind the
Colcutt tower. The fire brig-
ade was called out and rapid-
ly put out the blaze before it
could spread to the hot lab
where small quantities of rad-
ioactive materials are kept.
Three firemen were hurt when
a cylinder of compressed gas
exploded, and were taken
away by ambulance.
It is thought that the fire
began when liquid oxygen
came into contact with some
inflammable material, though
the exact cause is not known-
What is more to the point is
that fire engines have visited
the College at least three tjmes
within the last few months. In
a College where all manner of
inflammable matererials are
precautions do not seem to be
stocked in large quantities, fire
quite up to scratch.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You wouldfinda
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
