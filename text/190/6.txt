FRANK IRVING
Beit's Warden
Among the number of brilliant young men who arrived at
Imperial College just after World War II, there came to the depart-
ment of Aeronautics one F. G. Irving, Esq. A graduate of Liver-
pool University (whose finery he dons for Commemoration Days),
Frank's transfer of allegiance from the Mersey to the Thames has
proved a considerable enrichment to the College scene. His activities
as an academic worthy are not of wide general interest, though
the supersonic wind tunnel with its attendant storage cylinders and
giant vent pipe is evidence of his technical expertise ; but he has
a remarkable range of other interests and achievements.
He is perhaps best known in his
role of Warden of Beit Hall. The
Irving stature is not overpower-
ingly massive, but for years, the
appearance of his acquiline pro-
file, blue eyes glinting ironically
behind their glasses, the prelim-
inary " Hmmmm " and the sub-
sequent verbal astringencies, have
quelled the most turbulent of resi-
dents. His encounters with ama-
teur steeple jacks, nocturnal bell
ringers, Christmas tree removers,
phantom instrumentalists and
miscellaneous convivials have
made him immune to astonish-
ment, without diminishing his
sense of humour. Heads have
sometmies been lopped after par-
ticularly outrageous incidents, but
Frank's rule is notably undes-
potic. Year by year, the Beit
Hall photo shows him surrounded
by residents, some even smiling
and very few in attitudes of terror
or supplication. His calm and
efficient administration has set a
difficult standard for the coming
multiplicity of wardens.
Frank is also a leading figure
in the gliding world and has con-
tributed greatly to the present high
standing of the IC gliding club
and to the development of the
gliding centre at Lasham in
Hampshire. A highly accom-
plished pilot, holding the gold
" C " with diamond, and co-
author of a book on unpowered
levitation, he still holds, with
Lome Welch, the British two-
seater distance record. This flight
from Lasham to Belgium also
proved that his persuasiveness,
armed with only a driving licence,
is at least equivalent to a full set
of international documents plus
current passport. He is the chair-
man of the technical committee of
the British Gliding Association,
and he has been a member of the
British team at several world
championships. Functioning us-
ually as retrieving crew, he is
adept at this hazardous form of
motor sport in which an enor-
mously long trailer is towed
furiously over any type of road
which happens to lead in the
general direction in which the
glider was last seen. Any time
not spent in retrieving, dismant-
ling, reassembling and renovating
the machine is customarily de-
voted to fostering international
goodwill. This admirable cause
has taken Frank all over Europe,
and in February '63 to the Ar-
gentine pampas. The European
Championships at St. Yan aided
him particularly in his study of
burgundies, and he has acquired
some interesting bizarre record-
ings of Eastern European music
from an excursion in the vicinity
of the Iron Curtain.
Somewhat regrettably, one
must record that Irving is grossly
deficient in his appreciation of ball
games, except for a moderate
competence at squash.
He is also an indifferent per-
former at the air-water boundary,
but weighed down with a lead
belt and equipped with flippers,
etc., he manoeuvres as skilfully
as if he was airborne. Frank ac-
companied the very success-
ful Underwater Club expedition
to Malta, and an amphora of
about 200 B.C., one of many re-
covered, adorned his flat before
being prseented to the College.
His lofty eyriee at the top of Beit
Hall also contains a large collec-
tion of gliding mementos, an im-
posing stereo player, and a
multitude of colour transparen-
cies illustrating his quaint extra-
mural activities.
Although his domain includes
the College's residential accom-
modation for ladies, Frank seems
determined to remain the only
unmarried warden. It is not a
little surprising that this expert
dancer, former Union cabaret
star, and in private life, benevo-
lent uncle, should have contrived
to retain his eligibility. His re-
cent purchase of an electric
blanket for overnight stays at
Lasham is said to have caused
even the single ladies of the glid-
ing community to lose hope.
There is no space to enlarge
further on the Irving characteris-
tics (the taste for Elizabethan
song, the highly idiosyncratic
vocabulary — the Metropolitan
police are always " the gen-
darmerie," the consuming interest
in " Which" craft). His purpose-
ful commuting across Prince Con-
sort Road—longer journeys re-
quire a car—is part of the College
scene : he has contributed much
to our corporate life, and we trust
that he will do so for much longer
yet.

MINUTES OF A MEETING..
President: Gentlemen, you
have all been circulated with
mini-recordings of the last meet-
ing. I regret to say that as the
recording machine has broken
down you will in future have to
do without any records of the
previous meeting. The grave
financial state of the Union ren-
ders the cost of a new recorder
prohibitive.
Treasurer : A sensible decision.
Carruthers : Hear, hear!
Asst. Secretary: I entirely
agree.
Standley : Now wait a minute!
(All eyes fix on the speaker.
Secretary smoulders ; Treasurer
grits his teeth ; President takes
out a packet of government issue
cancer-free cigarettes and calmly
lights one. Standley ignores
them.) At the last meeting we
sanctioned the Bowling Club's
application for an atomic pow-
ered paint sprayer for their
bowling balls. Well, I mean to
say, that cost 750 nobles, didn't
it ? I really don't see why we
shouldn't spend a mere 40 on a
new recorder. I think it would
be just as useful.
Chairman of Athletics : (apop-
letic after last remark) Mr. Stand-
ley, you have an extraordinary
sense of values, if I may say so.
In fact, I very much doubt
whether you have any sense of
values at all. Are you seriously
advocating that we spend 40
nobles on a recorder ? Why, we
could buy four bowling balls for
that price, or two electro-mag-
netic golf clubs, or (practically
exploding at the thought) at least
six weeks supply of radioactive
muscle liniment for the rugby
club ! Do you realise . . .
President: (interrupting) Yes,
well we all agree with that. (To
Standley) We are all aware of
your radical views, Mr. Stand-
ley, but now is not the time to
state them, I feel. We have
some serious business on the
agenda, and I think we must get
on with it.
Standley: Now look here,
that's a little unfair ! I . . .
(drowned by cries of " Oh, shut
up !" " Do shut up !" " For —'s
sake, can't you keep quiet!" etc.
President: I would remind you,
gentlemen, that we are constitu-
tionally bound to break for exer-
cise every 30 minutes, and we
have already wasted 10 arguing
about trifles. I suggest we move
immediately to item 2 on the
agenda : correspondence. Is there
any correspondence ?
Secretary: We have a letter
from the London School of
Economics challenging us to a
debate.
Cvruthers: What's a " de-
bate "
President: You, have a bad
memory, Mr. Carruthers. You
were present when this Council
disbanded the Debating Society
two years ago.
Carruthers: Oh yes, that's right!
