A Message from the Chairman
Now that Carnival Week is in full swing I should like to
express my personal thanks to all those who have, and are, help-
ing to make this event a success. Should anyone feel that they
would like to help, especially next Saturday, they will be more than
welcome. If anyone feels that they cannot give of time then any
donation will be gratefully received.
The money that we raise will be financing the building of small
earth dams in the Northern provinces of Nyasaland thus bringing
life to millions of acres of hitherto arid land. Thus it may be
seen that our money will not be simply going into the vast maw
of Asia but will be doing real good. The aims of the Freedom
from Hunger Campaign are best portrayed by the adage : Give a
starving man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach him to cast
a net and you feed him and his family for ever.
I hope that everyone will enjoy themselves.
Yours sincerely,
JOHN R. MADDISON.
Cont. from front page
Harris brought all the weight of
Us superior postgraduate tech-
nique to bear on the problem,
wielding a slide rule with great
abandon.
The winning contestant was
handed a ticket for the May Ball,
and then congratulated by the
Executive in the usual manner—
see photo. All in all, it was quite
an ordeal, and it might perhaps
b
e an idea if the form of the
competition was changed so as to
make it less formidable for the
girls taking part. The fact that
out of an ICWA of well over a
hundred, only a few girls could be
persuaded to appear on the day
underlines the necessity for this.
The idea of walking the length of
the quad amidst cheers and cat-
calls, or worse still, grim silence,
is enough to discourage most
men, never mind the more timid
members of the fair sex.

COMMANDO RAID
Now the full story can be told.
On the evening of Aplil 30th,
the South Bank was the scene of
a planned assault, of an unprece-
dented scale, on a national
edifice.
20.15 hrs. The raiding party as-
sembled at Charing Cross Un-
derground Station — all was
quiet except for one policeman
who appeared to have vision of
another Trafalgar Square epi-
sode as he disappeared in an
easterly direction at high velo-
city.
20.20 hrs. The first assault group
crossed the Hungerford Bridge
and took up positions to the
south of the target. The at-
mosphere was tense, every man
feeling that tugging at the
nerves, that moment of truth
that comes to us all before we
" go over the top."
20.30 hrs. Cigarettes were
stamped out, hand shakes were
exchanged, and, with muttered
words of encouragement the
rest of the troops were on their
way. You reporter was ap-
proached by a man in a dark
suit and offered a " Players."
One receiving the password
" I.C. Carnival," he spat out
the words " Daily Express."
Since the operation was well
under way by this time it was
deemed safe to reveal the out-
line of our plans and, when he
had heard them, the Daily Ex-
press man phoned for an aide.
21.00 hrs. Except for a few
minor skirmishes all our troops
had penetrated the heart of the
target.
21.08 hrs. At a pre-arranged
signal the attackers unleashed
their weapons. After a mo-
ments surprise the defenders
capitulated and indeed wel-
comed our invasion wich a
round of applause.
21.15 hrs. The jubilant invaders
left the target and reformed
nearby to count the spoils.
The troops then made off to-
wards the West End and pro-
ceeded to sack it.
The Result—£130.
