Couldn't afford to run it any
more, or something.
President: No. Besides, there
wasn't sufficient support.
Standley: (sarcastically) I
should say there wasn't. Not
after you converted the debating
hall into an extension of the
bowling alley.
Chairman of Athletics: Well,
the old bowling alley wasn't big
enough, you must agree.
President: (to Secretary) Write
and tell them we challenge them
to funicular road racing instead.
Is there any other correspon-
dence ? There isn't ? Then we
pass to item 3, the Bar. Mr.
Smallpiece to report.
Smallpiece: The alterations to
the Bar are now complete. A
further 10 metres have been
added to the counter, a new re-
frigeration plant installed. . . .
Standley : Costing 1,000 nobles.
Smallpiece: 920 nobles, Mr.
Standley. As I was saying, a new
refrigeration plant installed, and
two additional barmen engaged.
The old committee room B has
been utilised to alleviate the
overcrowding in the bar, and
suitable seats have been pro-
vided. As Council suggested,
ladies are now excluded from the
whole of the ground floor of the
Union building, and notices have
been erected proclaiming this.
We should not have to suffer any
longer the embarrassment of
ladies wandering into the bar and
well, overhearing, you know . . .
Oh, yes !! The President will be
pleased to hear that a big im-
provement has been made in the
serving-hatch scheme between his
office and the bar; the whole
wall has now been removed, so
that the President's office now
forms, in effect, a small corner
of the bar itself. I'm sure this
will be appreciated by those
members of the College who have
been complaining of the Presi-
dent's isolation. Finally, gentle-
men, my own piece de resistance!
A private supply of Flowers Syn-
thetic Bright is now available at
a tap on the President's table.
(Cries of " Lucky beggar!"
"B • y favouritism, that's
what it is !" etc.)
President: Excellent, Mr.
Smallpiece, I can hardly wait to
move in. A most ingenious idea.
I mean the private supply. Very
commendable (pauses in reflec-
tion.) Yes. Well, we now pass
on to, oh dear ! (Catches sight
of the clock.) It's time for our
exercise break.
(At this point all the committee
members rise—Standley rather
reluctantly—and go into the next
room. It is a lavishly equipped
gymnasium. They strip off the
track suits they are already wear-
ing, revealing trim black shorts,
and start lifting weights, running
on the spot, etc. One suspects
that Standley's obvious dislike of
physical activity is in part, at any
rate, due to his not being very
good at it. In fact he is miser-
ably incompetent.
After 15 minutes a bell rings.
They all stop, put on their shirts,
and walk underneath an elec-
tronic de-sweater. This instantly
relieves them of the sweat of their
exertions, and they resume the
council meeting immediately.)
President: Item 4: estimates.
Treasurer to report on the de-
liberations and recommendations
of the finance sub-committee.
Treasurer : Gentlemen, you all
have before you a rvpy of the
preliminary estimates for the
next session. As you see, our
total income is estimated to be
N50,000. There are two main
items of expenditure, namely,
Athletic Clubs, N40,000; and Re-
creational Clubs, N4.000. Both
these estimates are slightly in-
creased over those of last year,
but not substantially so. I shall
not run over any of the other de-
tails, unless there are any ques-
tions.
Social Chairman: I can't find
the Social Clubs estimate.
Treasurer : Two from the bot-
tom sir. 250 nobles.
Social Chairman : That's 100
nobles less than we got last year.
Treasurer: Well, you have 3
fewer clubs. You can't very well
expect the same grant.
Standley: If they'd had a bit
more money they might not have
had to close down.
Treasurer: Come now, sir,
that's not true, and you know it.
These clubs just didn't receive
sufficient support. Not enough
people turned up at their
A.G.M.s, right ? Right. You
can't blame us for that. We're
quite prepared to support clubs
which are active in the College.
But the dead ones, no—that's
just a waste.
Carruthers : Hear, hear !!
Asst. Secretary: I entirely
agree.
President: Are there any more
questions to the Treasurer ?
(Pause.) Well, I think we can
take it then that these preliminary
estimates are acceptable and pass
on to the last item on the agenda:
Felix-Scrutiny-Phoenix. As some
of you are no doubt aware, there
appeared in the last issue of
F-S-P a certain letter which, it
might be said, does no credit to
the good name of this college. I
think it would be appropriate if
the Secretary read out the letter.
Secretary : Felix-Scrutiny-Phoe-
nix. 12th May, 1993. Page 4.
(Reads) " The Editor, F.S.P. Sir,
—In my humble opinion this col-
lege is going to the dogs." (Cries
of "Shame!" "Disgusting!")
" In fact, if I may say so, it has
already gone." (Hushed silence.)
Chairman of Athletics : (foam-
ing) I refuse to listen to this rub-
bish.
President: I think we must^
hear the letter in full. Continue,"
Mr. Secretary.
Secretary: (continues reading)
" Over the last 30 years we have
steadily isolated ourselves from
the University of Greater Lon-
don. We are the only College
which does not have representa-
tion on the Greater President's
Council, the only college which
fails to send a delegate to the
United Nations (London Univer-
sity Branch), and the only college
which does not have a Debating
Club. I could list more. I think
that worthy activities are being
neglected. This year is my last
year at college, and I can'f say
that I'm sorry. Your truly,
M . H . Smith.." (Prolonged
silence.)
Standley: I don't think it's a
very good letter, but I think he's
got a point."
Treasurer: (glaring at Stand-
ley) I think it is a disgusting
letter, a shocking letter. It should
never have been published.
President: Well, you know, we
can't tell the editor what to print
and what not to print. That
would be censorship.
Secretary: What we can do is
to ask him to publish a reply. I
could probably draft a suitable
one. That shouldn't be very diffi-
cult.
Carruthers: To be published
under the much respected motto
for full details of student transport
facilities in Europe

Address
of the College, " A Sound
Mind in a Sound Body." I for-
get the Latin equivalent.
President: You also forget,
Mr. Carruthers, we decided a
month ago that that was much
too long, and shortened it to " In
a Sound Body."
Chairman of Athletics: (still
choking) I don't see how anyone
can write letters like that when
this College has for the last 10
years, without exception, won the
Alwyn trophy, the National Uni-
versity Bowling tropy, the Pea-
body Cup, the . . .
President: (interrupting) Yes,
quite. Well, of course, we shall
continue to do so, I'm sure. No-
body really takes these letters
seriously, you know. So I
shouldn't worry about it. (Sorts
his papers.) It seems, gentlemen,
as if that concludes our business
for to-day. I therefore declare
this meeting closed.
(Whereupon he presses a button
on the table; a quiet whirring
sound is heard, a flap in the
centre of the table falls back,
and a tray carrying a pleasant
load rises slowly from below :
five cellulose bitters, a couple of
Wigmores' browns, and a large
Flowers synthetic bright.)
