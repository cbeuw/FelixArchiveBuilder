The first student inhabitants will move into two of the Halls
Residence (Falmouth and Tizard) on South Side on May 11th
tifter what can only be called a " take-over bid " by the College to
pnove the contractors. It is surprising that, at this late stage in
e year and with exams imminent in many departments of the
)llege, the majority of students originally offered places have opted
move in. However, being a resident for the remainder of this term
no way affects their application for residence in the next academic
|jear
Each hall consists of three floors
single study bedrooms with a
kneral circulation area first

t be fitted into the design
lewhere — one has never seen
peculiar shaped lounges (and
i will they be able to design
ings again without protrud-
pillars which festoon the

e with mocking dignity).
Kitchen facilities, laundries, sub-
wardens' flats, house-keepers'
offices and cleaners' rooms are
among the list for rooms required
for modern hostel living. The de-
tail has been adequately planned
with the exception of power
sources for electric razors and
kettles and each room is excel-
lently furnished. The jamming
window problem of Weeks Hall
may have been overcome by the
insertion of smaller sliding win-
dows.
Underneath the Halls of Resi-
dence are situated the new refec-
tory facilities and common rooms.
designed on virtually an open-lay-
out plan. The basement cafeteria
opened on Monday, but the re-
maining refectory facilities will
not be available for student use
until next session. The kitchens
have been excellently equipped
and the main refectory can be
adapted for self or waitress ser-
vice. The whole area possesses
a tremendous potential as a social
centre and relaxing area.
The finish of the whole building
is in slatted concrete which the
architect, Mr. Richard Sheppard,
claims " represents modern mat-
erials in their true light," but
which the Guardian expounds
" reflects barbarism." But if
architecture is taken as represent-
ing the methods and materials
available at the day in their best
form, then along with the new
Commonwealth Institute building,
South Side ranks as one of the
better examples in London.
Marion Chosen as
Carnival Queen
O R D E A L IN T H E QUAD
Lunchtime on Friday 26th in a
sunlit quad, saw the annual
parade of Carnival Queen candi-
dates before a large assembly of
expectant males. A carnival at-
mosphere pervaded the air, partly
due, no doubt, to the over-ampli-
fied strains of the Carnival Re-
cord (Oi fink itsa hit), and to the
fact that the bar was open.
Finally the long awaited mo-
ment came, the Executive, armed
with millihelen metres, took their
seats, and after a long series of
fanfares, the six cantestants
were introduced, and persuaded
to walk the length of the quad.
At first sight, it looked like a field
day for RCS, with two entries
from Physics and one from
Maths, but in the end, the prize
and the title went to petite
Marion Ponman, a secretary from
Electrical. " On points," we
should say, though she is a
" regular knockout," the judging
being done in terms of millihelens
per candidate: Helen's face
launched a thousand ships—how
many could yours launch ?
Answer in millihelens. Mike
