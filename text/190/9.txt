abuse could wake Preece, for whom
it was a weird night.
Much sight-seeing was done —
the walking kept everyone fit for
the matches. The team visited the
Louvre, Notre Dame, Musee d'Art
Moderne, and an evening at
L'Opera to see Don Carlos was
organised. To finish off one even-
ing in Montmartre everyone ended
up at Les Halles for onion soup in
the true Parisian style. However,
a fragrant odour soon diverted
many nostrils and it was fish and
chips 14 times.
One day we played football.
However the game (against L'Ecole
Centrale) was not as enjoyable as
had been hoped. The main diffi-
culty was language and as the
referee was Russian "O" Level
French didn't help. The result of
a rather scrappy game was a 2—2
draw.
After the game the destination
was "Le Jockey" to which fourteen
were admitted at a reduced party
rate. The cabaret was a little corny
to say the least. Finally, at 2.0 a.m.
with Rayner still holding the re-
cord (no drinks from his ml. of
Champagne) a young lady dressed
as a Bunny Rabbit came on, took
her clothes off and walked out
out followed by most of the four-
teen. . A few die-hards, however,
stayed till 3.30 a.m., during which
time the Captain had gone to sleep,
and Price had unsuccessfully tried
to fool a crummy mind-reader.
On Saturday night Fletcher and
the shifty-eyed Pick came in ran-
dily raving about " Le Sexy " only
to find Wilshaw not quite himself.
Eight of the lads were walking him
around with their hands on his
head, as he thought it was coming
off. This was followed later by
Munday running down the road in
his underwear trying to photograph
the Eiffel Tower.
Thus, on April 2nd, the lads,
clad with signs, perfume, Parisienne
nightwear \and various other sou-
venirs, left\Paris. Cox, unfortun-
ately was short of one of his
sketches due to the notoriously ill-
equipped Parisian toilettes.
The steamer was packed with
hordes of French schoolgirls, put-
ting Cox and Price in their ele-
ments. They entertained on deck
with songs whilst Pick slunk about
the gathered crowd looking for
someone " of age." The Captain
again went to sleep having earlier
that morning experienced that
(quote) " Le sexy est le plus joli
strip-tease a Paris, toujours servis
par un pretexte spirituel ou
galant."
The Lowestoft Hockey Festival
Fifteen members of the I.C.
Hockey Club attended the
Twenty-ninth Annual Hockey
Festival at Lowestoft over the
Easter week-end. The players
were: John Skinner (Capiain),
Frank Allen, Mike Butler,
"Ned" Castell, Tom Creer,
Tony Evans, " Rick " Heading,
Chris. Hennessy, " Ossie " Hun-
ter, Chris. Packard, Derek
Painter, Kerry Peters, Colin
Smith, Mike Stenning and Nick
Walker.
The Festival as always was very
enjoyable, the matches were
played on good grounds with skill
and determination, and in a good
festival spirit. The first match of
the five played was against Man-
chester University Lions who
were defeated 4—1, "Ossie"
Hunter in his usual form scoring
two, and John Skinner and Tony
Evans getting one each. How-
ever this initial success was tem-
pered by losing 3—0 to Kettering
in the afternoon, the forwards
squandering chances left, right
and over the top. On Saturday,
another two matches were played.
In the morning the I.C. forwards
recovered their form and the
Greenshanks were defeated 3—1,
Chris. Hennessy scoring one
goal and " Ossie " remaining con-
sistent scoring two. The after-
noon produced the first drawn
match. Our opponents were the
Royal Agricultural College,
Cirencester who started playing
with the determination to win at
all costs. Their sportsmanship
and knowledge of he rules were
often in doubt and the game
quickly degenerated. The final
result was a two all draw, Nick
Walker and Kerry Peters scoring
for I.C. In the evening the bad
taste of the match was quickly
replaced by the more pleasant
one of the local brews. No
matches played on Sunday and
and this was all to the good as a
few individuals required peace
and quiet in which to recover
from the evening before. The day
was spent in a variety of ways.
Several players enjoyed competi-
tive rounds on the nearby putting
green and a short walk to the Pier
Bar to see if the beer there still
tasted the same. Others pre-
ferred to practise Hockey on the
front. Initially they played on the
lawns but were soon informed
that there were some " Keep of
the grass" notices which had
been officially removed to prevent
them becoming souvenirs. The
promenade then became the prac-
tice pitch but their efforts were
frustrated again, the ball fre-
quently going in the sea, so they
also retired to the Pier Bar.
The visit to the Festival was
brought to a conclusion with an
enjoyable match against Kijana
on Monday. The match was
strongly contested and ended in
a one all draw, Chris. Hennessy
scoring for I.C.
Five matches were played in all.
Two were won, two drawn and
one lost, with ten goals scored by
the team and eight against.

Sailing Club retain
Championship
The college again won the
Castaways Cup, and this time in
very convincing style.
In strong winds that remained
throughout, nineteen teams took
the water on the first day.
Among these were strong U.C.
and London Hospital teams, both
of whom were knocked out in the
early rounds giving I.C. a rather
easier passage to the final than
expected. Lost form due to the
long ice-up was no longer evident
in the semi-final and I.C. had to
fight hard in the early stages of
their match against a C.E.M./
S.E.O.S./Bedford combine, while
Chelsea were beating N.C.L. in
the other semi-final.
The first of the two races in the
final gave I.C. a lead of 5^ points.
The second race initially pro-
duced the closest racing of the
week-end, the six boats being
bunched within as many boat
lengths for the first round, cross-
ing tacks with each other and
avoiding collisions by no more
than a few inches. The Chelsea
fight died later in the face of
superior teamwork ; and the I.C.
helmsmen—D. Pentz, R. S. Vines
and E. Twiname—.drew closer to
give I.C. the first three places and
the Championship.
The college second team were
knocked out by Chelsea, whose
more experienced team was hap-
pier in the heavy weather that
dominated the racing.
The teams were :—
First team: D. Pentz, R. S.
Vines, E. Twiname, T. Clarke,
R. Henson, and T. Podmore.
Second team : A . Thomson, H.
Tothill, Miss P. Howard, B.
Allsopp, A . Hunter-Henderson
and J. Riley.
A career

worth
If you divide the population into two groups —those
who take T H E TIMES and those who don't—you find
this: those who don't take T H E TIMES are in the great
majority. Those who do are either at the top in their
careers, or are confidently headed there.
T H E TIMES both by its seniority in experience and
by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper,
naturally commends itself to successful people. There
is no high level conference, no board meeting, no top
executive's private office into which T H E TIMES is
not apt to be taken.
This choice of a newspaper by people who get on is
indisputable.* In which of the two groups do you
place yourself?
