WILL DAWSON I’ve been a student rep in
DES(T) for two years; I know
things could still be better.
Here’s what I promise you:
● Communication: a webpage
stacked with events, training,
surveys, discussion boards for
your ideas for improvements,
socials, pictures, etc.
● To inform you about the
Faculty’s restructuring
● A more sustainable Faculty
and College. Firstly, by widen-
ing the recycling scheme that
we’ve pioneered
● A personalised training pro-
gramme: if you want computer
modelling or project manage-
ment courses, then I’ll lobby
for them
● To unify the Faculty: I’ll
push for social events funding,
and organise them
● You will know more peo-
ple (I can’t promise you’ll like
them)

OLIVER EARLEY Are you a physical scientist?
And want to have an exciting,
exhilarating, and generally
fantastic time whilst you’re at
University?
Then you know what to do!
With already loads of expe-
rience at organising events at
my sixth form college, I would
like to bring my enthusiasm
to the physical sciences union
so everyone can have a great
time. From paintballing, to
party nights, evening enter-
tainment of various varieties,
I intend to conquer the lot!
Remember the idea of the
union is that everyone has a
say – It’s up to you what we
do, but someone has to finally
organise it!
