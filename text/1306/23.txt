Two slices of America, please
The rather excellent Goldrush make their return to these shores, and The Thrills unleash
their latest chunk of West Coast melodic pop
LIVE REVIEW
The London Borderline has a love
of all things Americana; from the
bands they put on to the décor. It’s
therefore fitting that Goldrush play
there following their return from an
American tour.
The first support band Tanaou fill
the stage with their six members.
They make a strange sound, com-
ing on like Alfie trying to write the
score for a teen romantic comedy.
It’s good, as awful as that sounds,
though their singer could do with
some lessons on tuning.
Goldrush launch straight into
new material from their Ozona EP,
named after the yokel nowheres-
ville they broke down in on tour.
Introduced as a song about “try-
ing things I shouldn’t in the Joshua
Tree desert”, Things I’ve Lost
displays a fair chunk of their musi-
cal arsenal; honey-coated vocals,
sharp and jangly guitars, and beau-
tifully harmonious melodies. Lead
track from the EP
, Wait For The
Wheels, has a stomping rhythm
and catchy chorus. It’s uplifting
and rousing, putting a harder edge
on their normally indier-than-thou
sound.
Next up are a couple of old songs.
To my extreme relief, they play the
crowd-pleasing and glorious anthem
that is Let You Down, a song that
starts so tender it turns your legs
to jelly, and finishes with powerful
layers of sound that hit you right
in the gut. Secondly they play their
“smash hit” Wide Open Sky, an una-
shamedly poppy song that is sum-
mer condensed into three and a half
minutes.
Getting back to the new songs they
play the offbeat, and undoubtedly
brilliant, Jupiter and the oddly dark
There’s A World. Upon urging the
crowd to come to the front (which
sees everyone shuffle shyly forwards
a couple of inches) they launch into
the rocky 52nd State, a track that
makes little sense on record, but
comes together live. I never thought
I’d live to see Goldrush go rock!
They finish on an as yet unrecord-
ed track, which has a picked acoustic
melody overlaid by odd spacey elec-
tric guitar noises. In the customary
encore, front man Robin is joined by
co-vocalist and keyboardist Rob to
play a pretty acoustic track, before
the band finish with live favourite
Counting Song, leaving a jubilant
crowd drenched in feedback.
Though not exactly a new band,
Goldrush have obviously benefited
from a heavy touring schedule, and
look set to bring their own brand of
uplifting indie to an ever-increasing
audience.

The Thrills: “We’re gonna give you such a kicking”
SINGLE REVIEW
Back with the latest excerpt from
Let’s Bottle Bohemia (Bohemia
being quite a large part of the Czech
Republic, in case you’re interested),
The Thrills have gone for a nice
piano ballad. And isn’t it lovely. It’s
the sort of record you’ll play to a kid
to charm them to sleep.
When it started I thought someone
had wound up a musical box (actu-
ally, the whole record could eas-
ily be mistaken for one). As soon as
the vocals come in, you realise the
single sounds remarkably like the
Flaming Lips, which can’t be a bad
thing. The moving string arrange-
ments (composed by the same man
who worked with the Beach Boys,
strangely) are a nice accompani-
ment to the rolling piano.
Not For All The Love In The World
is in an unoriginal style, but The
Thrills have taken it on well. People
should like it, especially the Sleeping
& Dreaming society, who could use
it to fall asleep.

CLUB REVIEW
Few club nights can claim to have
reached a seminal status. However,
Speed is one of those nights.
Running between 1995 and 1996,
Speed helped to change many
people’s perceptions about drum
and bass, establishing it as a seri-
ous, emotive music form. Since its
demise, its co-founders LTJ Bukem
and Fabio have moved on, now both
hosting their own individual resi-
dencies at The End – the monthly
Progression Sessions and weekly
Swerve respectively. However, for
November’s session, LTJ had some-
thing special in mind: a re-union, a
chance to celebrate tunes of a cer-
tain vintage, and relive hazy memo-
ries. It was time to return to Speed.
It was also our return to The
End, after a long year’s absence.
Having braved the arctic November
winds to rendezvous in Mornington
Crescent, anticipation levels were
steadily fuelled by a few hours drink-
ing. We touched down at the venue
at around 11.30pm to be greeted by
the sight of a phat queue. However,
the efficient door staff moved things
on with a minimal amount of fuss,
and before long we were inside the
ride. Descending down into that
most legendary of London base-
ments, we were greeted by lights,
smoke, drums and bass – it was
good to be back.
After a quick excursion to the bar,
it was directly into the main room
where things were obviously already
in full effect. DJ Ink was at the helm,
mixing tidily through a neat selec-
tion of atmospheric rollers. There
has already been much said in these
pages about the merits of The End
as a venue, but a special mention
must be made of the atmosphere on
this night. The stark but stylish inte-
rior of the club complemented the
brand of futuristic music to a T and
the hundreds of people, shrouded
in smoke, occasionally lit by a laser
display, were in full appreciation.
At this point it was time for a brief
funk interlude in the second room,
courtesy of a certain Jazzy B (“back
to life, back to reality…”) repre-
senting the soul2soul sound system.
The vibe was nice, and bodies were
being shaken left, right and centre.
However, one was always conscious
of the events that were to take place
in the main room – namely the main
attraction, LTJ Bukem alongside
the ever faithful MC Conrad.
LTJ is renowned for his musi-
cal, string-fuelled take on drum
and bass, and what can be said
except that his performance lived
up to all expectations – and then
some. The Speed era was one of
the most creative periods the D&B
genre has witnessed, and in this
set we were treated to some of its
finest moments. Key tunes included
Bukem’s own Horizons and PFM’s
One and Only, not to mention
the tumbling sounds of J Majik’s
Repertoire. These were, of course,
complemented by the melodic tones
and conscious raps of Conrad, one of
the great MC’s who is not afraid to
let the music do the talking.
As Bukem’s finale wound down,
the crowd’s response reflected the
quality of the music. Who could pos-
sibly hope follow such a perform-
ance? Does such an entity exist?
There was only one man it could
have been...
Fabio, the liquid master, stepped
up in his own inimitable style at
around 3am and to be honest he
could have left after his first tune.
Digging deep to intro with that clas-
sic of classics, Atlantis (I Need You),
the tone was set. What followed was
nothing less than an exquisite con-
coction of strings, warm bass and
serious rhythms from circa 1996.
Highlights included Alex Reese’s
Pulp Fiction, whose pulsating
bassline sounded gargantuan on
the thunderidge rig, and Digital’s
Spacefunk – you just had to look into
the DJ booth to see what this tune
meant to the Speed originators: the
amen dropped, Fabio bounced like a
man possessed, LTJ amost snapped
his neck from excessive nodding and
MC Conrad sincerely suggested that
it be rewound back to the T-O-P
.
Come 4am, with metabolic rates
excited by the frequencies and
rhythms, we made our exit. At this
time in the morning, having expe-
rienced such a venue and musical
goodness, there is very little one can
do but buy some crab flavoured noo-
dles from the local all-night shop,
and recount the previous hours beat
by beat.

Return to Speed
Fabio and LTJ Bukem are two of the godfathers of drum and bass. Felix went along to
Progression Sessions, where the pair were having a bit of a reunion...
