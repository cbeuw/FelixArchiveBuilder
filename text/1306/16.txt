Early watch, groan... 4am
and a rude awakening from
the alarm. Like zombies, the
lucky chosen few crawled
up into the cockpit, happily
noted the lack of wind and
optimistically suggested that
we leave at 5.30am instead.
Mate Dave was straight back
in his sleeping bag, but the
Vantage crew were having
none of it and we set off into
the night.
On 30 October 2004, the
Imperial College Union Yacht
Club left on our annual cross-
channel mission. Two boats,
Vantage and Fandango, were
chartered and 21 of us set
off for Cherbourg in France
(and yes, more than one pass-
port was forgotten!) Store
cupboards groaning with
Morrison’s finest junk food
and plenty of beer, it seemed
like a great idea at the time
to eat a Twix for breakfast.
Those of us who spent much
of the weekend lying flat on
the deck decorating the sides
of the boat a less than pretty
colour soon regretted it.
With both boats well on their
way, or so we thought, skipper
Mike received a desperate
call from skipper James P on
Fandango; they were still in
the marina with less than two
hours’ worth of fuel, which in
the light winds would not see
them to France. A quick scav-
enge yielded enough diesel
to set off, but an hour behind
Vantage meant that against
all odds the tortoise had a
head start on the hare!
We crossed the shipping
lanes without mishap and
finally got the chance to do
some sailing. This was just
as well because Fandango’s
problems weren’t over yet;
the engine spluttered to its
death before they were even
past the Isle of Wight, just
whentheskipperandhismate
thought they deserved a quick
kip below. Mate Dave has
never leapt out of his sleep-
ing bag so fast! Unfortunately
this left Fandango reliant on
some decent wind to get to
Cherbourg and a goodwill tow
into the marina from its arch
rival Vantage. But after the
previous weekend’s gales,
the autumn sunshine and
keen wind was an extremely
welcome change and both
boats enjoyed a glorious
cruise interspersed with
some enthusiastic renditions
of Bohemian Rhapsody and
the odd jig from our resident
entertainer Jack.
Just after 5pm, Cherbourg
appeared on the horizon
and the Vantage crew were
looking forward to a hearty
French meal. But where
was Fandango? Two hours
and a beautiful sunset later,
Fandango limped into sight
heading for the leeward
shore. We had all hands on
deck to get out the tow lines
and fenders (and one unpop-
ular camera). Following
various fraught instructions,
some excellent skippering
and under Jenny’s naviga-
tion, we finally made it into
the marina at 8.30pm local
time. Beers were the order
of the day.
But there was no rest for
the wicked. Supplies, die-
sel, broken engine, showers
and dinner called. The girls
embarked on a supermarket
sweep ten-minute challenge
(not aided by their pigeon
French); members of the
Fandango crew went on a des-
perate mission for diesel; the
technically minded got down
to the dirty business of fixing
Fandango’s engine; which left
two champion French chefs
slaving over dinner for 21 in
the galley.
Dinner was a merry affair
with everyone squeezed into
Vantage’s main cabin for spa-
ghetti bolognese and cheap
French plonk, apart from
James Y who preferred his
£6.99 bottle of white spirit
(oops, sorry, vodka) that came
back to haunt him.
A slightly later start on
Sunday courtesy of the
clock change saw us head-
ing into what looked like a
storm. Most of us slunk off
back below deck for a good
Sunday lie-in and were woken
up at lunchtime to beautiful
sunshine and just in time to
see the dolphins swimming
around Vantage. Meanwhile
on Fandango, broken heads
(toilets) saw Dave, only
just out of his sleeping bag,
caught out by an unexpected
tack (thanks, Stefanos) tak-
ing a piss over the back over
the boat.
The race was really on
as both boats took advan-
tage of the good wind and
steamed back towards the
Isle of Wight. Back in broad-
cast range of Ocean FM we
enjoyed a good singsong,
basking in the sunshine and
appreciating the cruising life.
With the sun going down fast,
and temperatures rapidly
dropping, spirits started to
fail; we still had three hours
of sailing against the tide to
reach Gosport. Multiple lay-
ers of clothing and a dinner of
Pringles and Haribo restored
cheer, just in time for a hair-
raising return to Gosport
playing dodgems with ferries
and tankers. Fireworks in the
distance didn’t aid navigation
but after a fantastic, albeit
eventful, weekend, we made
it back safely to the relief of
two exhausted skippers and
their crews.
