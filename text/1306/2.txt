There really hasn’t been one
overriding story this week,
like the American election
last time, so the newspapers
have been free to jump on
their old hobby horses and
report the subjects that they
care about most.
That is: immigration and
gypsies’ camping sites for The
Daily Mail, the incursion into
Falluja for The Guardian, The
Independent and The Times,
Becks’ possible retirement
for the tabloids, and Boris
Johnson for nearly everyone.
So what were they all saying?
The battle of Falluja was
obviously one of the most
important news stories of
recent times in Iraq. The
city, which has been a centre
for insurgents, was attacked
by the American and Black
Watch troops before a house-
to-house search was per-
formed. Almost all the town’s
inhabitants had fled to refu-
gee camps and the city was
nearly destroyed.
While American troops
began cleaning up and
rebuilding – desperate that
the people didn’t return to
see bodies in the road and
their houses torn down – their
behaviour was under scrutiny.
The Red Crescent, an Iraqi
aid agency, complained that
they had been stopped from
bringing supplies into the city
by the troops, who wish to
run the aid themselves. Even
more seriously, television
footage of a marine shooting,
at close range, an unarmed
and apparently helpless Iraqi
fighter was aired. The soldier
was immediately removed
from duty while an investiga-
tion was carried out.
Some of the best articles
about Falluja come from The
Times, which has an extreme-
ly good reporter ‘embedded’
with the marines. While he
reported tactics and the mood
among the troops, the anti-
war Guardian focused on the
news that the Iraqi elections
may not take place in January
as planned, due to the insur-
gency.
This would be seriously bad
news for Tony Blair, especially
if it dragged on into his cam-
paigning time for our general
election in May, suggesting
as it does that there is no
order in Iraq and the coalition
have not really ‘won’ anything
yet. It is bad news too for
President Bush – the later the
elections are, the longer he
has to pay for everything.
Nearly all the newspapers
were engrossed in the news
thatBorisJohnsonwassacked
as Tory arts spokesman for
having an affair with a journal-
ist on The Spectator (which
he edits) and then allegedly
lying to his leader Michael
Howard about it. Surprisingly,
most of the papers argued
that there was really no need
for him to go, especially as
Mr Howard was himself cited
in divorce proceedings after
‘winning’ his wife away from
her then husband.
The Guardian pointed out
that politics is the last pro-
fession in which it is possi-
ble to be sacked for adultery,
suggesting it is bizarre to
think that we the public sug-
gest high moral standards of
MPs when we believe they
are always lying and cheat-
ing anyway. The Mail disa-
greed, saying that cabinet
or shadow cabinet ministers
should set an example of
honesty and integrity. They
may have a point in that the
Tories are desperate to cut
out the sleaze allegations that
dogged them throughout the
nineties, although this seems
to be going a bit far.
Johnson has denied lying
about the affair, and is pre-
dicted by all to have a quick
return to politics. Some pun-
dits suggested that the rea-
son for his departure was that
senior Tories are jealous of
his media success; others
that Boris is in fact being cun-
ning and getting out now so
that after the general elec-
tion he can appear as a ‘new
broom’ not associated with
Mr Howard’s time as leader,
ready to start his own leader-
ship challenge.
Meanwhile, The Mail was
not, for once, talking about
asylum seekers. It had moved
its radar to focus on the new
‘threat’ to our way of life, gyp-
sies. It greeted with horror
the news that the Government
is suggesting that local coun-
cils increase the number of
sites available for parking for
travellers. None of the other
newspapers really picked up
on this story so I suspect this
may well turn into another
Campaign where only The
Mail can save us. Watch this
space!
Justice, Johnson and gypsies
Reading the newspapers so you don’t have to: Emily Gwyer looks at some of the week’s
biggest national news stories

Researchers at Imperial
College have found that levels
of hepatitis C among young
injecting drug users across
London are dangerously
high.
The sample consisted of 428
injecting drug users aged 30
or younger. 42% of those who
tested negative at the begin-
ning of the study became
infected with hepatitis C with-
in the first year, while 3.4%
became infected with HIV.
Dr Ali Judd, who is based at
Charing Cross Hospital and
is one of the authors of the
study, said: “Hepatitis C is
now spreading at epidemic
levels across London and HIV
incidence is worryingly high...
There is an urgent need for
new and comprehensive pro-
grammes to tackle this grow-
ing problem.”
The hepatitis C virus can
cause serious liver damage,
and is mainly spread by shar-
ing needles and syringes.
Factors that may have influ-
enced the rise in hepatitis
and HIV infection include a
rise in the number of injec-
tors, riskier injecting behav-
iour, no increase in the num-
bers of syringes distributed,
and a lack of targeted health
campaigns, according to the
researchers.
