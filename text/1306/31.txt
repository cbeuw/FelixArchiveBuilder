Imperial Men’s 1st 3
St Bart’s Men’s 1st 0
By Pat Farr
Fully expecting to win the
game, Imperial Firsts were
keen to get back on track with
a convincing result in light of
tougher fixtures ahead.
St Bart’s, to their credit,
started brightly and offered
some early attacking threat,
however following this wake-
up call Imperial soon found
form and began to assert
their superiority.
Berks and McMahon were
dominant and progressive in
centre midfield, linking well
with the Imperial front two to
trouble the visitors’ defence.
Both forged good opportu-
nities, with the best falling
to McMahon who skied a
header from centimetres out
via a sweet Sugito left-wing
cross. St Bart’s, meanwhile,
did nothing to threaten, while
relentless Imperial pressure
began to present opportuni-
ties from corners and open
play.
Berks and Wright com-
bined on the half hour to feed
Nedved (seriously), who baf-
fled the St Bart’s centre back
with a neat turn inside the
box before being obstructed.
With the Mallorcan at an alti-
tude of 80ft, his feet behind his
neck and crying “eghhh!”, the
penalty was swiftly awarded.
After reflecting on a sea-
son of uncompensated pen-
alty box assaults, Wright then
took the time to place the
giant Art Attack set square
prop (supplied by Imperial
defender and actual Neil
Buchanan stunt-double,
Thomas Gray) against his
foot and map the direction
of the spot kick straight into
the ‘keeper’s hands. Imperial
Firsts still searched for an
opener...
The breakthrough came
quite deservedly on the half
hour mark; a right wing cross
found its way to Sugito who
slotted home coolly from the
back stick. One-nil Imperial.
A similar situation arose
just minutes later, only this
time an unmarked Sugito
blazed over from McMahon-
like proximity to the goal.
Half-time came, and although
frustrated at a mere one goal
advantage, Imperial had
recorded possibly their most
impressive half of football all
season.
Eager to maintain their
excellent work rate, Imperial
started freshly with some
early spells of possession. Yet
they lacked the movement
and incision of their first half
display and went noticeably
‘off the boil’ for a quarter-hour
spell. St Bart’s were dogged
in defence but offered little
in the way of creativity, while
Imperial’s sloppy execution
showed signs that their first
half exuberance was perhaps
taking its toll.
The home side rallied half-
way through the second half,
and a succession of dead ball
situations finally paid divi-
dends through Farr’s header
from a dangerous Elhalhuli
corner. With the comfort
of a two goal cushion, and
the destination of the three
points never really in doubt,
Wright added a third with a
neat finish from Joe’s cen-
tre after tidy work down the
right. Job done for Imperial,
and a period of easy posses-
sion saw the game out with
a clean sheet and convincing
result, reward indeed for a
dominant performance over
weaker opponents.
Highlight of the match
belonged to the Northern
disco feet of one Joseph
McMahon, who pulled out
an outrageous 360 degree
mega-Cruyff straight from
Michael Flatley’s locker.
“Flatley my dear, I don’t
Riverdance”.

City & Guilds 78
ThaiSoc 12
By Andrew Towers
On an unusually warm
Hallowe’en weekend, the
most glamorous team at
Imperial College took to the
field for their first match of
the season in the aftermath
of a “successful” pub golf ses-
sion a couple of weeks ago.
A ThaiSoc team that had
previously overturned the
Imperial Thirds team was the
opposition, not to be taken
lightly. The 22 man C&G
squad contained an eclectic
mixture of first to fourth team
players, all with one thing in
common – the ability to bring
grotesque amounts of glam-
our to a rugby pitch.
C&G stamped their author-
ity on the game within min-
utes of the start, with Stu “the
beast” East touching down
after some heinous try avoid-
ance from Les Jon Spencer,
our flying French fly-half.
The tries kept on com-
ing, with Le Douge Higgins,
Les Jon, and Jim “master
lungemeister” Pedder all
taking advantage of a disor-
ganised ThaiSoc defence. A
lapse in concentration and
some poor tackling allowed
the ThaiSoc inside centre
to crash through from short
range to open their scoring.
Outwardly frustrated by this,
C&G responded with another
three tries before half time,
courtesy of some great team-
play and pornstar moves from
Les Jon (still drunk) and cap-
tain Andy ‘Teflon’ Towers.
Half time score: 47-7.
In the second half, captain
Towers called for improved
defence, bigger tackles and
of course, more glamour. The
team responded instantly
with substitute centre and
revelation Alex Davis kindly
showing his opposite number
where the floor was. The
champagne rugby continued
to flow, with tries from Mark
“porno” Wills, Pedder and
Le Douge for a second time
each, fresher and tour vet-
eran Charlie (mini Nathan)
Davidson, and Dom Chan.
Other highlights included
an overzealous spear tackle
by Porno Wills, almost decap-
itating his unfortunate victim
in the quest for the Biggest
Hit award. It was ThaiSoc
who had the last word though,
with a dubious chip and chase
try, duly awarded by a some-
what sympathetic referee.
Final score: 78-12.
With spectacular perform-
ances from all members of
the squad, and particularly by
the newcomers and freshers,
picking a man of the match
became the hardest moment
of the day. The honour went
to fresher and debutant Alex
Davis for some silky skills at
centre.

No forwards... no problem
Imperial Women’s 1st 35
King’s Women’s 1st 0
By Scotch
The Virgins have had a diffi-
cult start to the season, facing
our two hardest opponents
in BUSA in the two opening
weeks, so we were hoping for
better in our first ULU league
match.
For the first time ever,
we had no forwards and a
changing room full of backs –
excuse me? Are we still play-
ing women’s rugby? Some of
us also had no pants, but I
suspect that wasn’t a first!
So poor Udders had to be
forcibly held down and made
to put on the number three
shirt, and off we went. Except
the opposition hadn’t shown
up yet, so we stood about and
drank Red Bull for a bit.
By the time the game kicked
off, there was only time for
70 minutes of rugby, but we
made the most of it.
Within the first five minutes,
Spandex had taken a quick
tap penalty and ploughed over
the line with three ineffectual
King’s backs hanging off of
her shiny white shorts. This
set the tone for the rest of
the match, the forwards hog-
ging the ball to great effect
and carrying it up the pitch.
Our second try was a simi-
lar affair, with the forwards
mauling the ball over the line
and Spandex suddenly pop-
ping out the other side of the
ruck to set the it down.
We then mauled the ball
over the line again but the
ref decided it was held up
– pesky refs, always spoiling
my fun. And then he had the
cheek to disallow another try
by Filthy. How rude.
Filthy covered herself in
glory again two minutes later,
when our ball was turned over
on our 5m line and King’s got
the ball to their wing, who had
made it to halfway and was
clean through until Filthy’s
fantastic covering tackle.
The second half saw two
tries from Joss, who picked
up from the base of the scrum
to crash over.
We made the most of our
superiority in the scrum,
where the King’s front row
were struggling. Scotch took
a quick tap penalty and found
her way through a dog–leg
to get clear for a fourth
score. Danger Mouse had
spent the afternoon trying to
work blindside moves, which
finally paid off and allowed
her through to score in the
corner, although she almost
dropped the ball as she was
so busy celebrating!
King’s tried to catch us
out with a quick restart,
but instead kicked the ball
straight down the throats of
our forwards and into Felix’s
waiting arms. We mauled it
10m up the park until Kings
collapsed the maul. Scotch
picked the ball up amid the
confusion, and the next
breakdown saw Udders take
it on and power home from
the 22 for our final score.
Honourable mentions
must also go to Bambi, who
was fearless on the wing as
always, although we didn’t
like passing the ball right
so poor Whiplash only saw
the ball twice all game! The
backs keep improving as
the weeks go by, and Ali had
some fantastic crash ball at
inside centre.
Our final special mention
must go to Alex Ferguson,
who dropped the C7G span-
ner on Dappy’s foot, leaving
her on crutches and com-
pounding our forwards short-
age. But then it was her silly
fault anyway for gatecrashing
the Engineering Freshers
Ball.

Holloway Men’s 4th 1
Imperial Men’s 4th 2
By Michael Nicholson
Wednesday was the biggest
event of the season for the
fourths, the infamous Hammy
Ten pub crawl. Amazingly,
the date coincided with the
Holloway away fixture, the
biggest and most difficult
game of the season.
Top of league, undefeated,
only two goals conceded, and
with a full time manager,
there was no doubting that
Holloway would be favourites
for this one. Imperial’s task
was made all the more dif-
ficult when top-scorer Shwin
was ruled out with a knee
ligament injury, and Paul was
still struggling with an ankle
knock. Oz was drafted in to
play on the left, and Chris
Parrot moved up front.
It was Holloway who
started the brighter, with
their midfield looking particu-
larly strong, and Vanni had to
make a stunning tip over the
bar to preserve the deadlock.
Imperial were having trou-
ble keeping possession with
misplaced passes, poorly
executed tackles and a lack
of communication being very
much the order of the day.
An injury to Holloway’s left
winger prompted Captain
Vanni to rally the troops, tell-
ing us to play our game and
keep things simple. Obviously
Chris had been listening
intently, and kept things nice
and simple in the corner by
performing a perfectly exe-
cuted rainbow kick. The team
however did begin to dig in a
little harder, and managed to
get some sort of foothold in
the game.
Holloway, however, got
themselves in front courtesy
of a neat finish from their
central midfielder, after the
Imperial backline had made
a complete pig’s ear of a rou-
tine ball through the middle.
Into the second half, it
looked like things would get
worse with Holloway’s con-
stant attacking pressure akin
to Vanni when he’s on the pull
– relentless and seemingly
only a matter of time until
they scored. Fortunately, they
missed a couple of gilt-edged
chances: firstly Vanni made
a point blank save, tipping a
goal bound effort onto the bar,
and then with Vanni caught
out of position their striker
tugged his short wide when
he should have done better.
Suddenly with 20 minutes to
go Imperial found the belief
which had been sadly lack-
ing, and managed to create a
chance for Jai. Their ‘keeper,
who was slightly larger than
your average bungalow,
came off his line with sur-
prising speed and managed
to smother the well-struck
effort. Still, the chances were
coming regularly now and
Imperial’s defence began to
dominate Holloway’s now
sole striker.
Eventually a corner from
left was met firmly by
Demetris, leaping like the
pinkest of pink salmon, and
the ball looped into the top
corner despite the efforts of
Holloway’s man on the line.
The game was now wide
open and it was Imperial who
seized the win with an oppor-
tunistic strike from Oz after
Demetris had once again
shown great perseverance
and skill on the right. With all
hands to the pump, Imperial
snuffed out the Holloway
threat and easily played out
the few remaining minutes
for probably the most signifi-
cant win of the season.
The day was perfected by
some magnificent drunken
debauchery on the Hammy
Ten, the highlight of which
was Vanni proving true cap-
tain material by vomiting
after a whole two pints.
