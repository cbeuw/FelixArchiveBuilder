First of all, the trailer to this film is
rather misguiding and pretty atro-
cious, but the actual movie itself is
a bundle of laughter.
Confusingly, the trailer gives the
impression that the movie is an
action flick, but it turns out that
Taxi falls into the comedy genre,
and is a pretty good example at that.
One would think that the distribu-
tors, 20th Century Fox, would give
the trailer more thought consider-
ing that it plays an integral part in
the decision-making process of the
viewer: should they see the movie
or not?
Regardless of the trailer though,
the movie is pretty hilarious; not
due to the crazy jokes and brilliant
witty comments, but because of the
plain lunacy of the plot, characters
and overall feel.
This isn’t a movie that is going
to inspire you to greatness or
increase your IQ level. Just like
Belle Williams (Queen Latifah) says
to Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon),
“don’t think!”
That is the key here. Watch it if
you are up for a good laugh and
after a couple of pints in the pub.
Now for the secret plot of the
movie! What plot? There really
isn’t one. However there is a story,
directed by Tim Story (yes, that is
actually his name!)
Belle is a high speed taxi driver
who fires through New York streets
way over the speed limits, with
gadgets in her cab that put James
Bond and Batman to utter shame.
Her normal life is put on hold
when she meets wannabe top-cop
Washburn whose undercover and
driving skills are on the lower side
of the scale. They end up in a high
pursuit of four bank robbers, led by
the cold and calculating Vanessa
(Gisele Bündchen).
This ultimately leads to Belle los-
ing her taxi to the FBI and making
her boyfriend lock her out of the
apartment. Belle joins forces with
badgeless Washburn to get her taxi
back, and the only way to do this is
to figure out the thieves’ plot and
catch them. This is easier said than
done.
Obviously the highly accurate
bank robbing plan is carried out by
four Brazilian supermodels, led by
Vanessa. Her acting is totally hor-
rible, but this doesn’t matter as her
scenes are based around her impos-
sibly long legs.
There is also a little girl-to-girl
action that comes in between. So
is this a guy flick? Yes. But
needless to say, the action scenes,
high-speed car driving, humor-
ous cliffhanger moments and silly
mayhem provide fun for all. It’s
comedy and something you could
see with your friends and have loads
of fun.

Star Wars goes online
Right, lets get one thing straight
ladies. Your boyfriends will not have
been best pleased if you decided to
drag them along to watch Bridget
Jones: The Edge of Reason. Those
of us with the Y chromosome have
been dreading this film. No ‘buts’.
I had the misfortune of being
dragged kicking and screaming to
watch it at the weekend. I knew that
The Edge of Reason was a chick
flick. I am not judging this movie on
that basis; The Edge of Reason is an
adequate chick flick. Fundamentally
though, there are some humungous
problems with this movie.
Darcy and Cleaver are utterly
unrealistic – no male in the real
world is anything like them! I found
Cleaver to be downright sickening,
and a complete misrepresentation
of boyfriends around the world.
Another problem with this movie
was the part where Bridget goes
to jail – a complete time-filler and
totally peripheral to the actual ‘plot’
of the movie. There really is no plot
now is there? Was there any char-
acter development? Did anything
really change between the start and
the finish? No.
The soundtrack was terrible, one
pop song after another, with abso-
lutely no imagination or original-
ity at all. The script was terrible, so
bad in fact that I actually burst out
laughing at the most inappropriate
moment.
I could go on for ours about why
I hated The Edge of Reason, but
there’s not enough room. As a final
word on it, do yourselves a favour
ladies and leave your boyfriends at
home on Championship Manager
when you go and watch this. It’s
probably less destructive to your
relationship (but only marginally).
On to more positive things, I saw
The Grudge and Bad Santa last
week, which were absolutely fan-
tastic. The Grudge is good example
of horror movies at their best and
Bad Santa is so funny and politically
incorrect it seemed wrong. They
come highly recommended. Also,
although I didn’t have time to do a
review, Shaolin Soccer is well worth
watching. I saw it a couple of years
ago, and wet myself. All of you out
there with a childish, silly sense of
humour should go see it.
For all you stereotypical Imperial
males out there, the new Star
Wars trailer is now online at
www.starwars.com. Unfortunately
though, the film won’t reach us until
19 May 2005.
Other trailers that are worth a
look are House Of Flying Daggers,
the next big movie coming out of
China, which stars Zhang Ziyi and
Andy Lau. Then there is Elektra,
a spin-off from Daredevil. There’s
also a sequel to The Ring, unorigi-
nally entitled The Ring Two. Those
of you with a nervous disposition
and a VCR should avoid this. Those
of you who like to torment your-
selves, like me... enjoy!
Happy cinema going!
