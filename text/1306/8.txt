Depression... you’re not alone
At this time of year, many people go
to College early in the morning and
then come back at night.
Of course, this means that in some
circumstances people don’t even
see daylight. This in some instances
can make people feel low and down
about things. Also, this time leading
up to Christmas in the academic
year is a notoriously busy time for
students with lots of deadlines to
keep up with and a very high work-
load.
Everyone at some time in their
lives feels down, sad or low; this
is of course a normal part of life.
People often describe themselves
as depressed when really what they
mean is that they are feeling a bit
down. However, when these feel-
ings are not just for a couple of days
at a time but in fact are for weeks
or even months, this could mean
that you are suffering from clinical
depression.
This can affect everything you do
and sometimes you can feel like
there is just no way out.
It is important to know how you
feel when you become depressed,
and it is also important for your
friends, family and housemates to
know what to look for in you if they
feel you are suddenly not your nor-
mal self.
Here are some things to look out
for in yourself and other people who
you may feel are depressed:
● A feeling of overwhelming sadness
and a loss of interest and pleasure
in things you would normally enjoy
● Feelings of guilt, worthlessness or
hopelessness
● Difficulty in sleeping and par-
ticularly that you are waking up a lot
earlier in the morning
● Feelings of anxiety, tension
● Becoming irrationally worried
and irritable
● Feelings of tiredness, no energy
or appetite, and loss of weight
● Difficulty in concentrating, mak-
ing decisions or remembering
things
● Having recurrent thoughts of
death or suicide
If you are suffering with depres-
sion, you may feel that there is no-
one out there who can help you.
But at Imperial, there are plenty
of people who can help. The Health
Centre on campus can help people
suffering from depression, and so
can the College Counselling service.
The Union Advice Service can also
help if it is affecting your work. Just
remember, you are not alone.

STUDENT ADVISER
People often ask me, “What’s so
great about the Union anyway? Why
should I get involved?”
There are lots of reasons that
spring to mind: a superb range
of clubs and societies; affordable
places to buy food, drink, stationery
or regalia; an evening of entertain-
ment at one of our ‘Ents’ nights...
the list seems endless. However, the
one thing that makes me passion-
ate about making a difference for
Imperial College students is repre-
sentation. Indeed, one of the Union’s
primary aims (and the only thing
that no other body is going to do)
is to represent its students to the
College and other bodies.
How do we do this? Well, in order
to accurately convey the views of
our students, we need to know what
your views are! The usual mecha-
nism for this is our network of elect-
ed representatives, and it is right
that we should place emphasis on
this, since the Union is a democrati-
cally run organisation. However,
there are times when we need
student feedback in a more direct
way. One of those times is now. We
need direct student input on two
big projects which are taking place
at the moment. The first of these is
the Union’s Strategic Review, which
is described in more detail on the
opposite page. The other project is
the QAA Audit.
This year, the College will undergo
what’s known as Institutional Audit
by the Quality Assurance Agency
(QAA), an independent body set up
to safeguard the public interest in
sound academic standards. This
is done by carrying out reviews of
standards and quality in higher edu-
cation institutions.
The QAA considers student
involvement in the audit process to
be very important and there are a
number of ways in which students
will be involved. During the audi-
tors’ visit, groups of students will
be invited to meet with the auditors
to discuss various aspects of their
experience of the College.
In addition to this, Imperial
College Union is also invited to sub-
mit a written statement to the QAA
on behalf of the student body. The
Union considers this a worthwhile
opportunity to contribute to improv-
ing standards within Imperial
College and is now undertaking a
research project that will form the
basis of our submission to the QAA.
The Union will soon be launch-
ing a questionnaire whose aims are
twofold: it will allow us to better
represent your views when it comes
to writing the submission, as well
as forming the heart of the feed-
back necessary for the success of
the strategic review. Check out the
Union website’s homepage (www.
union.ic.ac.uk) for the latest news
on these exciting projects.

Where does the money go?
Imperial College Union is a £6m
turnover organization. You might
like to know where this money
comes from and how it is spent.
So, I thought I’d spend this column
going through it all. The key thing to
realise is that whenever you spend
money in the Union it gets reinvest-
ed in student services and activities
to benefit you.
Subvention
The College gives the Union a sub-
vention each year of around £1m.
This is intended to support the core
activities of the Union: represent-
ing students, supporting your edu-
cational needs, looking after your
welfare and promoting legitimate
student activities.
The money we receive from
College effectively comes from the
Government, so there are restric-
tions on what we can spend it on. We
can only spend the money directly
on Imperial students, and in accord-
ance with the terms laid down by the
College. We cannot, for example, use
it to buy free beer for everyone.
Trading income
The bulk of the Union’s income
comes from our commercial servic-
es. This includes the bars and cater-
ing in Beit Quad, Charing Cross and
Wye campus, as well as the shop and
newsagent on the South Kensington
campus’ main walkway.
Because the Union is part of the
College, which is a public body, we
are again limited in what we can
spend this money on – we have
to spend it, directly, in benefiting
Imperial students. However, pro-
vided we meet that criterion, we can
spend this money on pretty much
anything. There are no detailed con-
ditions, unlike with the grant from
College.
Of course, the trading operations
have costs too. Yet these are lower
than the income from these outlets.
The point is that the profits are
used to subsidise the various other
activities of the Union. Whenever
you spend money in the Union, you
are effectively spending money on
yourself since the proceeds will be
reinvested in student activities and
services.
Clubs and societies
The second biggest source of the
Union’s funding comes from the
clubs and societies. The Union, of
course, gives money to clubs and
societies, but they also raise a fair
amount themselves. All clubs have
a minimum membership fee which
is calculated to be 25% of whatever
grant they have been given. On top
of this, grants for some activities are
only part-subsidised (for example,
travel is subsidised by the Union
at 50% with the balance being paid
by the club or society’s members).
Many clubs are also successful at
generating income through ticketed
events and sponsorship.
The Union supplements the money
the clubs raise themselves by giving
each club a grant. These grants are
calculated during the annual budg-
eting round, held during the spring
term.
Administration, welfare and
representation
Just under 10% of the Union’s
money is spent on office ‘admin’
costs. However, very little of this
really is admin. Much of it is rep-
resentation (provision of sabbatical
officers and appropriate supporting
functions). The Union also provides
a number of welfare services from
the full-time Union Adviser to the
programme of ‘soft skills’ personal
development courses.
Keeping the buildings going
Some money is also spent each
year on the upkeep of the Union’s
buildings. We do not pay rent to
the College but we are responsible
for maintaining our own areas. In
addition we also set aside a small
amount each year to save up for
small to medium size refurbishment
projects. The last major project was
the establishment, in 2001, of the
Union’s Media Centre and Student
Activities Centre in the West and
East wing basements of Beit respec-
tively.
Summary – Union profits are
reinvested in you
The Union is run for students, by stu-
dents. The grant from the College is
the smallest chunk of the pie. Most
of our money actually comes from
students’ own pockets (the trad-
ing income and the self-generated
income of the clubs and societies).
And all of the Union’s money is
spent, in one way or another, on stu-
dents, as directed by democratically
elected student officers.
It’s therefore important to remem-
ber that when you spend money in
the Union you are not only support-
ing the Union but essentially spend-
ing money on yourself. So next time
you are concerned about your club
or society not having enough money,
or not enough being spent on serv-
ices that you use, please bear this in
mind: if you decide to spend money
in the Union that you would other-
wise have spent elsewhere then you
are increasing the pot of money that
the Union can spend on you.
