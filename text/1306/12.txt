ANTHONY BROWN
ORDINARY MEMBERS OF
HOUSE COMMITTEE
● The House Committee considers the management, maintenance and usage of
the Union Building and other areas in the College
● There are 4 positions available, and there are 8 candidates plus the option to
re-open nominations
I’m a 3rd year, Mech Eng,
Yes i’m in DramSoc so we
can skip that question. I’m
also involved in IC football
aswell, with have friends in all
kinds of other societies who
use various parts of the union
buildings. So my experience
of the buildings and clubs
needs do expand beyond the
Concert hall and a few store
cupboards.
DANIEL CARRIVICK
Throughout six years at
Imperial I’ve been heavily
involved with various commit-
tees and other union activi-
ties both at club member, club
committee and CSC levels.
This has given me a compre-
hensive understanding and
broad knowledge of union
processes, only achieved
through many years of hard
work. It would be a shame
to waste all this experience
and I feel after having gained
so much, I would like to give
something back to benefit the
students.
On the House Committee
I’ll represent RCC clubs by
fighting for essential main-
tenance and improvements
to the store rooms in Beit
Quad west basements and
the Laundry.
MARTIN CHONG
So why do I want to be elected
to House Committee? Well
firstly I won’t hide the fact that
I have been or are involved in
societies that make a great
use of the Union premis-
es. For example I am the
DramSoc president. However
this has meant I have spent
an unhealthy quantity of time
in the Union and have seen
the problems and heard the
complaints, particularly about
storage space. In addition I
will be in a very good position
to understand the pros and
cons of any proposals and not
just let money get spent for
spending’s sake. So vote for
me!
RICHARD JORDAN
I am standing for house com-
mittee because I am heavily
involved in two organizations
(Ents and Dramsoc) that
depend on the union build-
ing and fully appreciate how
important all of the union’s
premises are to every active
member of ICU. I also have
a good working knowledge of
the union buildings.
As a committee member, I
will ensure that the premises
can perform all duties expect-
ed from them, be it clubs and
societies or hire to external
organizations which gener-
ates revenue for the union
and therefore its student
members.
SEBASTIAN JUNEMANN
Having been a student here
for over two years now
I’ve got a good idea of the
workings of the Union and
how it affects the students.
Being on the committee of
Imperial’s MTSoc has given
me the experience of dealing
with the sort of politics which
the Union is famous for and
immersed me in the running
of this organisation. Making
the insane choice of running
for Union Council and House
Committee is really down to
one thing. I want to see the
Union run the way we want it.
Vote for me and I’ll represent
you. RON won’t.
ANTON PIATEK
I am standing for House
Committee because I believe
that the rooms and facilities
available from the union are
the most important thing to
many clubs. Imperial has a
huge number of clubs and
societies and as a commit-
tee member of three clubs,
I know what clubs have to
go through. I intend to make
sure the students get what
is best out of the facilities
available.
DUNCAN RICHMOND
Yes I’m in DramSoc. There
I’ve admitted it. BUT.
As a member of DramSoc, I
spend a rather large propor-
tion of my time working in
and around the Union’s facili-
ties. Hence I believe I am well
qualified to stand as a mem-
ber of house committee. Of
particular concern to me, is
the issue of storage space for
society equipment within the
union itself. This issue is not
merely confined to DramSoc
but is particularly important
to many of the sports teams
in the Union and I am keen to
bring this matter for discus-
sion. The state of the union
bars and entertainment ven-
ues is also I believe a key
issue.
DAN LEHMANN
Why vote for me? I have lots
of knowledge as to how the
union works. I have been a
member of House Committee
before and importantly, am
not a member of DramSoc, so
I do have other users of union
facilities at mind.
I have also sat on Services
Committee for just over
2 years, and know a great
deal about the minibuses, as
well as how this committee
works.
Last year I observed on
Trading Committee, in which
I put together a paper on loy-
alty cards with another mem-
ber. Vote for me, because I
know what to do.

College Union:
HONORARY
SECRETARY
● There is 1 position available, and
there are 2 candidates plus the option
to re-open nominations
JASON CLARKE
If I become Honorary
Secretary I would like to
make all the members of
C&G aware of this member-
ship as not enough people are
aware of what C&G does at
the moment. Apart from my
traditional responsibilities to
those in the office I would
like to extend the functional-
ity of the C&G office to those
visitors who come seeking
information, creating a more
friendly environment with
more information available to
those who need it. I intend to
make and carry out plans for
a successful summer ball to
follow on the success of this
terms’ fresher’s ball.
HELEN DAWSON
I have been Year Rep,
Chairman of Fencing, a
member of CGCU Active and
MechSoc, and currently the
Dept. Rep for Mechanical
Engineering. This wealth of
experience makes me the per-
fect candidate for Honorary
Secretary because I have
already built up trust with
students across college and
proved I am organised and
capable of handling respon-
sibility as well as day-to-day
duties such as meeting min-
utes. I have a good relation-
ship with the Exec already,
understand the commitment
involved, I will inculcate
enthusiasm and help make
the CGCU a pro-active and
supportive part of the lives of
all engineering students.
PUBLICITY
OFFICER
● There is 1 position available, and
there is 1 candidate plus the option to
re-open nominations
DEREK WAN Most students do not need to
know about the internal oper-
ations of the Student Union,
but quite often they are not as
involved as they could be. Part
of this problem can be solved
by having a Publicity Officer
serve as the first contact for
students. The officer must
listen to the thoughts of the
students, answer their ques-
tions, pass on their queries
as well as to deliver updates
on the ongoing events of the
Union. In addition, the Officer
should actively seek feedback
from the students to find and
tackle issues which can be
worked on. I believe that I
have the necessary skills and
experience, as well as the
commitment to serve as a
successful Publicity Officer.
