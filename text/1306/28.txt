Ugly XI
Foot in mouth
It must be a hard life for celebrities,
all that stick that they get from the
press. Journalists want those inti-
mate details and sometimes celebri-
ties are just too stupid. They think
they are defending themselves, but
no, they don’t realise that they are
giving away all of thier secrets. In
“Foot in mouth” you just have to
decide which celebrity said what.
We’ve made it even easier for you by
adding some pictures of them so you
can decipher which one is which;
just match the star to the title of the
quote.
THEY LIE ABOUT ME
“There was a lot of tabloid journal-
ism about my supposed sex addic-
tion. Bullshit. It’s all bullshit. I mean
come on, I never pretended to be a
saint.”
THEY’RE UNFAIR TO ME
“If I make a, like, raise my eyebrows,
some critics say I’m doing Jack
Nicholson. What am I supposed to
do, cut off my eyebrows?”
THEY’RE MEAN TO ME
“Just because I have my standards
they think I’m a bitch.”
IT’S NOT EASY TO BE
AS GREAT AS I AM
“There are, I think, three countries
left in the world where I can go and
I’m not well-known as I am here. I’m
a pretty big star folks, I don’t have
to tell you. Superstar, I guess they
could say.”
MY LOVE LIFE STINKS
“The last time I was in a woman I
was visiting the statue of liberty.”
IT’S NOT EASY BEING
A WOMAN
“It costs a lot of money to look this
cheap.”
I’VE A HARD JOB
“Just standing around looking
beautiful is boring, really boring, so
boring.”
