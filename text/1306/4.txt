Angry seagulls, Proposition 71, Columbo
The news this week: man
sacked because he was too
fat to get through the security
turnstiles at work. Student
injured as seagull tries to
steal her sandwich. And final-
ly, German woman caused
£15,000 of damage when she
tried to eat a bowl of muesli
while driving her car.
Bush’s election victory was
a few weeks ago now, but it
was just as absurd as any of
the stories mentioned above.
Its effects are already becom-
ing apparent, especially within
the scientific community.
Scientists wanted Kerry
to win. Not only was the
Democratic candidate in
favour of all-out stem cell
research, but he was also
more in tune with scientists
when it came to other issues
such as environmental policy
and science funding. Kerry
was the candidate for science
(see Felix 1300).
So what are scientists plan-
ning to do in the aftermath
of such a disastrous turn of
events?
Californians have just
passed Proposition 71, a $3
billion funding measure that
will put the state at the fore-
front of stem cell research. It
won 59% of the vote and was
shown to be popular across
all ages, races and incomes,
according to an exit poll con-
ducted for the Associated
Press.
This vote could possibly
mean a ‘gold rush’ of scien-
tists from across America
and the world to the Golden
State. To stem this flow, other
enlightened states such as
New Jersey, Massachusetts
and New York should be quick
to raise money for state-led
research.
So not only has Bush polar-
ised his country and the world
with his medieval foreign pol-
icy, he has now polarised sci-
ence within the United States.
This polarisation is perhaps a
symptomoftheculturalunder-
current, the struggle between
the forces of enlightenment
and dogmatic religion.
This week in Science, we
have a feature article on the
benefits and increasing pop-
ularity of alternative medi-
cines. Anushri Patel looks at
natural therapy and describes
how her brother success-
fully treated a verrucca with
banana peel. We also have
a story about ‘ethnic drugs’,
another controversial story to
emerge from the USA, where
scientists are targetting drugs
at ethnic groups. Rosie Taylor,
who happens to be our resi-
dent dietician, will be placing
this issue under the spotlight.
Also did you know that Lt
Columbo’s character was
based on that of Porfiry
Petrovic in Dostoyevsky’s
Crime and Punishment?
What a quality piece of trivia.
A new drug, BiDil, is expected
to be launched onto US mar-
kets next year, when it will
be prescribable for African-
Americans only.
Results from clinical tri-
als of the drug to treat heart
failure in African-Americans
have shown that survival
rates increased by 43% when
the new drug was used in
addition to the convention-
al treatment. The 18 month
multi-centred RCT, published
in the New England Journal
of Medicine last week,
which enrolled 1050 African-
American patients with heart
failure, was stopped early
because the results were so
compelling. Previous trials of
the drug using a mixed popu-
lation sample showed disap-
pointing results.
The research has sparked
controversy, not because of
the impressive efficacy of the
treatment, but due to con-
cerns that the researchers
have oversimplified the con-
cept of ‘race’ without a real
understanding of the genetic
basis for the medicine. There
is a consensus among lead-
ing scientists that ‘race’ is a
weak substitute for the vari-
ous genetic and non-genetic
factors that influence health
status.
It has been accepted for
some time that certain eth-
nic groups are more prone
to some diseases than oth-
ers. Heart failure, or end-
stage cardiovascular disease,
affects around five million
Americans, but African-
Americans suffer dispropor-
tionately; they are affected
by heart failure at a greater
rate than that of the non-
African-American population,
and they present with and die
from the disease at an earlier
age.
The increased efficacy of
BiDil in African-Americans is
thought to result from genetic
differences in the processing
of nitric oxide in the body,
low blood levels of which
contribute to heart disease.
However, geneticists argue
that the manufacturers of
BiDil have neither carried out
pharmacogenetic evaluation,
needed to determine if genet-
ic factors explain the drug’s
enhanced effectiveness in
African-Americans, nor have
they properly excluded the
influence of subtle environ-
mental factors.
Instead, BiDil is being
marketed as a drug to suit
an entire ‘race.’ However,
African-Americans do not
share a common ancestry
and are genetically far more
nuanced and variable than is
reflected in just skin coloura-
tion. Genetic variation among
different populations is a con-
tinuum, rather than discrete,
nonoverlapping entities and
there is therefore “likely to be
huge variation in how African
Americans will respond to the
drug” says leading geneticist
Professor David Goldstein
from University College
London.
BiDil may be a little prema-
ture but the Human Genome
Project, once completed,
could define a concept of race
that is scientifically credible
and useful. With more data, a
better understanding of indi-
vidual genetic variation could
be achieved and the resulting
knowledge could be impor-
tant in helping to illuminate
the race issue. Geneticists
feel that information from the
human genome project could
eventually be used to assist
doctors in streamlining the
search for the right diagnosis
for a set of symptoms, and
then allow the use of drugs
tailored to a particular patient
group.
However, concerns have
been voiced regarding the
possibility of research into
genetic variation impacting
negatively on society. There
are worries that data show-
ing genetic variation between
groups could be oversimpli-
fied and used by racists as
‘evidence’ for the superior-
ity of a particular group of
people.
Others have voiced con-
cerns that poorer populations
could be neglected in drug
development, whereby com-
panies developing drugs for
specific ethnic groups create
“orphan genotypes” – genetic
groups not large or profitable
enough to conduct work on.
Advances in understanding
the genetics of richer popu-
lations could then lead to an
exacerbation of disparities
in the quality of health care
among different racial or eth-
nic groups.
A potential solution has
been employed in the USA,
where regulation ensures
that minority groups, that
have been traditionally under-
represented in clinical and
biomedical studies, are over-
sampled in any government
funded genetic research, so
that significant results can
be recorded. However, such
regulations do not exist in
Europe.
It is likely that advances
in genomic medicine will
exacerbate health dispari-
ties unless explicit efforts are
made to ensure that future
research and treatments are
inclusive.
Ethnic drugs: sensible treatment or racist ideology?
As scientists in the US plan to market a new ‘ethnic drug’ for African-Americans,
Rosie Taylor considers whether science is in danger of reinforcing social barriers.
Are ethno-centric drugs the wave of the future or just an example of bad science?
YOUR SCIENCE VIEWS
tell Felix what you think
In the title to the article on MRSA
(last week)... it said that hospitals are
‘deathtraps for the sick’. This is a
massive injustice to the thousands of
people that work in Britain’s hospitals...
and is typical of the media’s coverage.
Matt, Civ Eng 3
I appreciate your concerns about the comment
made last week. The use of exaggeration was
necessary to highlight a situation that should
be at the forefront of everyone’s attention. By
and large, hospitals are doing a great job, but
MRSA is an issue we cannot afford to
completely ignore.
