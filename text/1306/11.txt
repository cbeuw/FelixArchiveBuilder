KEVIN BEZ
ORDINARY MEMBERS OF UNION COUNCIL
● Union Council is the sovereign body of the Union, capable of overruling any other committee. It meets roughly once a
month during term time and generally confines itself to considering high level policy
● There are 11 positions available, and there are 13 candidates plus the option to re-open nominations
I am a German-American
citizen and a first year under-
graduate in Information
Systems Engineering in
the EE Department, and
currently live in Holbein &
Willis Jackson. I have gath-
ered much international
experienced when living in
Germany as an American
and visiting an International
School. Being here for a
month I haven‘t got much to
offer you in terms of achieve-
ments or positions at the col-
lege. However if you VOTE
FOR ME, I will promote the
inclusion and expansion of
multicultural and internation-
alist events and expanding
the internationalist flair of the
college. If you enjoy interna-
tionality and multiculturality,
choose me for Council.
DANIEL CARRIVICK
Throughout six years at
Imperial I’ve been heavily
involved with various commit-
tees and other union activi-
ties both at club member, club
committee and CSC levels.
This has given me a compre-
hensive understanding and
broad knowledge of union
processes, only achieved
through many years of hard
work. It would be a shame
to waste all this experience
and I feel after having gained
so much, I would like to give
something back to benefit the
students.
SAMAH ELSAYED
Why vote? This summer I
spent some time volunteer-
ing in a poor and isolated vil-
lage in Sudan inhabited by
many refugees from minority
groups and saw first hand the
effects of having no represen-
tation or voice. We here are
fortunate enough to have a
system where we can get our
views heard and needs met
but the only way to do this is
by going out (or in this case
online) and voting.
Why vote for me? I haven’t
got any grand promises of sin-
gle-handedly revolutionising
the running of the union but
what I can say with all hon-
esty is that I will do my best
to fairly represent your voice
on all issues. I am not afraid
to speak out when needed
and am always approachable
so get your views across and
vote!
EDMUND HUNT
The Union Council needs
members that are serious
about achieving the best out-
comes for Imperial students.
I believe I have the dedica-
tion and judgement needed
to facilitate this as a Council
Member. Effective student
representation is necessary
if Council is to function prop-
erly; as a first year student, I
want to make sure this impor-
tant constituency has a clear
voice at the table. As some-
one who is not part of the
Union clique, I believe I can
supply some fresh, innovative
thinking. Let’s keep the Union
focused on the job: improv-
ing services for us all while
spending our money wisely.
SEBASTIAN JUNEMANN
Having been a student here
for over two years now
I’ve got a good idea of the
workings of the Union and
how it affects the students.
Being on the committee of
Imperial’s MTSoc has given
me the experience of dealing
with the sort of politics which
the Union is famous for and
immersed me in the running
of this organisation. Making
the insane choice of running
for Union Council and House
Committee is really down to
one thing. I want to see the
Union run the way we want it.
Vote for me and I’ll represent
you. RON won’t.
DANIEL MORAIS
I am not here today to waste
yourtimewithpromiseswhich
are made to elude you! I have
no promises but YOU DO!
Your ideas will be my prom-
ises, your opinions will be my
aims! I can surely guaran-
tee that YOUR VOICE will be
HEARD and FELT! Your con-
cerns and suggestions will be
understood and put across. As
running member of the Union
Council and Representative
of the Life Sciences, you
WILL BE HEARD! I DO
NOT stand here as myself,
Daniel Morais! But I stand
here FOR YOU, for your voice
and ideas! I don’t promise you
the world, the impossible! I
promise you MORE than
that, a VOICE! Vote for Daniel
Morais for Union Council! You
have never spoken so LOUD!
Thanks
HENRI OZAROVSKY
My aim is to spread enthusi-
asm and make a difference
even if it’s only a small one
within the Union and more
importantly: Get Things
Done. I know that there are
issues to be dealt with but I’m
not too convinced that com-
plaining helps. I’m not saying
we need to overlook the prob-
lems, I just think that we have
to promote and grow from the
parts of the structure that
work well.
In my view, you need two
types of people on the Union
Committee Board: some who
are reserved and others who
are enthusiastic. I catego-
rize myself as the second but
I think that you need both
mindsets to reach a good
balance. Being discerning is
important but acting is even
better.
ADIL RAZA PARVEZ
Hi everyone, for those of you
that have not gotten to me
yet, my name is Adil. I am
sure that there will be aspects
of the department or sys-
tem that you may not like, or
which you would think would
be good to add. I am open to
any opinions, suggestions, or
complaints you would like me
to voice and you will always
be able to reach me around
the clock even if it means
waking up at 4 in the morning
to answer a phone call!
But more importantly, this
role would give me the best
chance to get to know all
of you much better. So vote
for me, I’ll get you what you
want.

FromparticipatingintheRAG
Fashion Show to captaining
the Imperial College Rugby
Club to fronting the most
Glamorous Club at Imperial
College, I have been heav-
ily involved in Union life over
the last three years. Now in
my final year, I want to use
my experience with the union
and the different councils
and committees within it, but
more importantly my contact
with a huge number of stu-
dents to help bring the real
student voice to the Union
Council. Given the oppor-
tunity, I am confident that I
can fairly represent students
and act in the best interest of
students.
