To those who haven’t studied
England in the 12th century or
have seen the classic 1964 film with
Richard Burton and Peter O’Toole,
the story of King Henry II and
Thomas à Becket maybe rather
unfamiliar. It is one of the great-
est stories of friendship of English
history, combining love, obsession,
greed and a mammoth power strug-
gle between two men.
The play Becket was written in
1958 by the French playwright Jean
Anouilh, who took several liberties
with historical accuracy. He tells the
story of Thomas à Becket as a Saxon
noble confused in Henry’s Norman
court, uncomfortable with Henry’s
deep trust in him and in conflict
between his loyalty to his king, the
church and his own roots. This new
production takes a traditional stance
on the play, and stars Dougray Scott
as Becket, and Jasper Britton as
Henry II.
At the start of the play, Henry has
singled out Becket from his group of
nobles as his particular companion,
and together they pass their time
hunting and womanising. Henry
confides in Becket and, against the
wishes of his other advisors, he
makes the young Becket chancellor.
The death of the Archbishop of
Canterbury gives Henry the oppor-
tunity to make reforms in the
church, and he decides to appoint
Becket as the new Archbishop.
Becket tries to refuse, telling Henry,
“I can’t serve God and you at the
same time,” but the King is ada-
mant, and Becket is consecrated as
the new Archbishop.
Absorbed by his new role, Becket
resigns as chancellor and turns
away from his old life of excess to
that of an ascetic priest. He protects
the Church’s interests and refuses
to allow Henry to make the changes
he wants. Henry is furious, and soon
their conflict reaches crisis point,
forcing Becket to flee to the conti-
nent.
The Pope insists that Becket and
Henry make peace, and Becket
returns to England, but soon after
excommunicates the Archbishop of
York. Henry flies into a rage when he
hears the news, which prompts four
of his nobles to storm Canterbury
Cathedral. Upon his refusal to par-
don those he has excommunicated,
they stab him to death, leaving his
corpse on the altar.
Anouilh’s take on the story has
a lot to do with his experiences
in Nazi-occupied France. Dougray
Scott, as Becket, expertly portrays
Becket’s more duty-filled actions,
but his high-handed treatment of
the King before his consecration is
somewhat unconvincing. Although
the King relies on him heavily, looks
up to him and is constantly reli-
ant on his opinion, Scott’s portrayal
seems too detached, making the
conflict he experiences more about
his duty to the King and God, rather
than his personal conflict of friend-
ship versus duty.
Britton’s Henry is a much more
engaging character. His alternating
weakness and strength, his ever-
changing power over Becket as a
King against Becket’s power over
him as a mentor makes the play
both absorbing and unsettling. His
obsession with Becket is convinc-
ing, and his struggle to uphold his
own wishes in the face of Becket’s
tyrannical attitude, coupled with
his deep personal love for Becket
is seamlessly depicted. His grow-
ing self-hatred is sympathetically
played, and by the end his final deci-
sion is both believable and a natural
climax.
Don’t be put off this play by its
complex historical context. The lan-
guage and style are contemporary
and approachable, and the repeating
motifs of oppression and racism are
strikingly relevant to today’s society.
But the lasting impression is of the
destructive friendship between the
two leads, and the timeless conflict
of love with duty.

A high-handed and troublesome priest
Emily Lines reviews one Frenchman’s take on one of the most famous friendships in English history
“I will ever be grateful for the almost
psychic gift that enabled me to write
Blithe Spirit in five days during one
of the darkest years of the war.”
Blithe Spirit has had the longest
run of all Noel Coward’s works. It’s
popularity is quite deserved, as it is
a hilarious play.
It is a comedy perfectly illustrat-
ing the old saying that ‘two’s com-
pany, three’s a crowd’. Charles, an
author and socialite, on the passing
of his wife, remarries. As part of
his research for his next piece of
writing, a mock seance is held. The
medium, Madame Arcati, performs
the honours.
The seance has some rather unex-
pected results. Usually, the some-
what eccentric medium manages
to only amuse her clients, however,
on this occassion she manages to
summon the ghost of Charles’ first
wife.
Much to the first wife’s amuse-
ment, the only person who can see
her is Charles. This coincidence,
fits her plans perfectly: she is deter-
mined that wife number two, Ruth,
has to go. She will not be parted
from her husband even by death.
Much amusing confusion ensues
as Elvira, wife number one, does
her best to try to chase Ruth out
of Charles’ life. Ruth is not ready
to be ousted, so Madame Arcati is
called upon to remove the ghost.
Unfortunately for Ruth, Madame
Arcati’s powers are not entirely reli-
able.
The Savoy is currently running
a production of Blithe Spirit, star-
ring Penelope Keith as the infamous
Madame Arcati along with Aden
Gillett, Joanna Riding and Amanda
Drew as Charles and his beloved
wives.
For anyone who enjoys the wit of
Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward is highly
recomended.
