ALBUM REVIEWS
For the unlucky few who haven’t
heard about the antics of the
Brighton-based Eighties Matchbox
B-Line Disaster, here’s a quick
recap. Lead singer Guy McKnight
cries, dribbles and runs head first
into the speakers when perform-
ing live, and they got mainstream
attention with their debut single,
Celebrate Your Mother, about the
joys of fornicating with your parents
(“It’s a dirty job but someone’s got
to do it well!” he crooned), which
was followed up by the short spiky
album Horse Of The Dog.
The Royal Society, their follow-up,
aims to send their goth-metal to a
new dimension, helped by Queens
Of The Stone Age producer Chris
Goss. Opening with the intense Rise
Of The Eagles, it’s a prime example
of The Eighties Matchbox B-Line
Disaster at their finest: menacing
bass lines, quick riffs and surre-
al lyrics which are not too distant
from a Leonard Cohen album. We
have Guy’s awesome voice pelting
out “I wanna fly like an eagle / I
wanna sing like Sinatra / I’ve got a
date with destruction / I wanna love
like a mother!” in his trademark
baritone, then switching to a high
pitched squeak for the chorus line,
“All dressed up and ready to go!”
Surrealism and gloom is the order
of the day here, with lyrics such as
“Here’s you your skin, so pale and
thin / Give me your skin for danc-
ing in” in the creepy I Could Be
An Angle, and the downright weird
“What do we do with puppy dog’s
tails? / What do we do with a bucket
of snails? / What do we do with a
boy like you? / We put them in a pot
and throw them on a fire!” on the
gothic Puppy Dog Snails, which had
me laughing like a loon when I first
heard it.
The new production sheen can
also be felt, with Drunk On The
Blood being an impressive Queens
Of The Stone Age influenced mini-
epic with two distinct parts, and
the bass-driven Mister Mental,
which most people would know
from Shaun Of The Dead. One of
the highlights of this process is the
gloomy Temple Music, a surpris-
ingly personal song of lost love, with
the haunting chorus “And now I’ve
ripped out your heart dear / I’ve got
to throw it away” which is dripping
with atmosphere.
Despite the band’s strengths, the
album in general suffers from a lack
in diversity in other tracks. Some of
the guitar sections start to sound
repetitive and boring, recycling the
same riffs from before. Also, these
songs drag on too long, repeat-
ing choruses too many times and
undermining the epic sound of the
other songs.
So here’s the crux: at 45 min-
utes, it’s just too long. Which is a
great shame, because The Eighties
Matchbox B-Line Disaster show
some great talent here for an atmos-
pheric tune, but haven’t managed to
create a cohesive album, having too
much filler in between the strong
tracks. If they can learn to keep it
leaner for next time, we could be
looking at one of the finest bands
around today.
Matthew Hartfield
Appearances can be truly mislead-
ing. I picked up From Shadows
Came Darkness with half-hearted
pessimism, expecting, from the
monochrome cover and minimalist
presentation, some sort of depress-
ing but competent indie melancho-
lia. I didn’t expect an interesting,
varied and utterly surprising blend
of classic rock and contemporary
metal, but that is exactly what I got.
The album kicks off with a simplis-
tic and sweet classical piano track
that wouldn’t sound out of place
in either a HIM song or a Classic
FM easy listening compilation, but
it soon turns into something com-
pletely different. From the second
track, Act of Sorrow, onwards,
Mendeed show off the metal cre-
dentials that have had them tour-
ing with the likes of Anthrax and
My Ruin. Marrying ambitious soar-
ing guitars with speed drumming
and desperate, hoarse screams and
growls usually associated with the
far more extreme end of the musi-
cal spectrum, they create a blend of
the traditional and the outré that is
just that bit more exciting than most
of the generally available metal-lite
out there. Not easy listening by any
stretch of the imagination, it’s still
compelling and intriguing; like ice
cream laced with razor blades, you
can feel the danger but you just can’t
help yourself.
If it were indeed ice cream, razor-
blade-laced or otherwise, the one
thing you can be sure of is that it
wouldn’t be vanilla, even that really
nice vanilla with the clotted cream.
Not content with a highly skilled
winning formula, Mendeed scatter
the album with unexpected inter-
ludes – a spot of almost flamenco-
esque acoustic guitar with floaty
female vocals here, what sounds like
children chanting in an unspecified
African language there, a hidden
track that returns to the classical
theme of the intro, but with a much
more intense, brooding atmosphere
– that make you prick up your ears
with curiosity. To switch metaphors,
it’s rather like eating Revels: you’re
never quite sure what you’re going
to get, but you know it’ll be good.
Except that Mendeed don’t really
have an equivalent for the one fla-
vour you always try to palm off onto
someone else; it’s all pretty damn
fine.
In the interests of unbiased report-
ing, it’s probably best that I point out
that some sections of the album do
tend to drag; in between the random
bits of oddness, the music itself is
a little one-sided. Really, though,
that’s splitting hairs when it’s so
brilliantly executed: tight, coherent
and relentlessly driven. Metal pur-
ists could demand some more integ-
rity to the genre while those unac-
quainted with it could ask for a bit
less obscurity, but all in all this is a
fantastic crossover album that, at a
mere 36 minutes, will leave you hun-
gry for more. Like those teeny tiny
individual pots of Ben and Jerry’s,
but with a lot more punch.

Picture the scene. Four 30-some-
things gather around their Ikea
coffee table after putting their 2.5
children to bed. After discussing
the next people carrier they wish
to buy, and celebrating the fact that
one of them has been promoted to
“executive-vice-sub-divisional-mar-
keting-strategist”, the subject turns
to music. They suspiciously eye the
Dido CD lying on their aforemen-
tioned generic ‘stylish’ furniture,
recently, and hurriedly, removed
from their in-car hi-fi. They read in
the latest Child Motivation Monthly
that exposing your child to violent
TV actively suppresses their ruth-
less-overachieving gland, and that
dude from Buffy was in a Dido song
or something. So, they ask, who do
they turn to next to provide their
children with soothing drive-time
music?
It could well be Feist. Oh my God,
where to start. It’s bland, it’s annoy-
ingly hushed, it’s jazz for a genera-
tion devoid of soul and it’s preten-
tious (there are songs in French!)
Possibly worst of all, it thinks it’s
quirky. Compared to artists of a sim-
ilar age producing gloriously eccen-
tric solo semi-folk (see the brilliant
Devendra Banhart, Regina Spektor,
Iron and Wine) it’s about as quirky
and interesting as a wall upon which
paint dried 50 years ago.
And the instrumentation! Just as I
thought I would bite off my own ears
if they didn’t use drumsticks instead
of brushes, I found I was begging
for their return as the percussion
was replaced with finger-clicks. And
that is pretty much the most inter-
esting thing I can say about it. You
may wonder why there are no track
names stated here; you may wonder
if I have only listened to it once. Oh
no, I sat through it three times. Felix
owes me a beer (I’ve heard it, and I
agree – Ed).
Want a more quantifiable repre-
sentation of its awfulness? Feist are
supporting Keane. That means in
theory they are not even as good as
Keane. Go and buy this for someone
you don’t like.
