Latest from the Square Mile
Consumer confidence soars as lawbreakers are fined and competition increases.
Numaan Chaudhry explains
With the excitement and
uncertainty of the US elec-
tions out of the way, life in the
financial world returns to nor-
mal, with more investigations
and complaints and yet more
competition for clients in the
Asian markets.
The next scandal
Pessimism about the state of
the oil industry continues to
grow after Shell’s misvalua-
tion of it’s oil reserves earlier
this year.
Jeroen van der Veer, the
new chief executive of Royal
Dutch/Shell, is especially con-
cerned about other large oil
drilling and distribution firms
that have not yet undergone
the sort of tough regulation
that forced Shell to reduce
it’s oil reserve estimates by
40% to 20%. BP claims 80%
proved assets but if the SEC
(Securities and Exchange
Commission) were to inves-
tigate this, van der Veer is
smugly confident that the
figure would need to be re-
adjusted. In fact, if all the
major oil companies agree to
an external audit, rather than
trying to dodge the inevita-
ble forced investigation, an
industry-wide scandal could
be avoided.
Spitzer strikes (again!)
Share prices of three major
insurers fell by an average of
4% as Eliot Spitzer, the New
York attorney general, broad-
ened his investigation into
MetLife, UnumProvident and
Prudential Financial.
As investigations continue
into Marsh’s practices, fresh
accusations of insurers pay-
ing illegal commissions to
brokersinexchangeforcorpo-
rate business arise. Arguably
the largest insurer in the UK,
Lloyds TSB has urged insur-
ers that use Lloyds to ensure
that procedures are in place
to prevent anti-competitive
practices.
Furthermore, as a sign
of the far-reaching effects
of Spitzer’s probe into this
industry, Zurich Financial
suspended many of its staff as
it carried out internal audits
on affairs related to Marsh &
McLenna.
HSBC v Citigroup
HSBC officials in Korea are
hoping to increase their mar-
ket share in Asia by acquiring
a 50% stake of Korea First
Bank, thus putting HSBC
in direct competition with
Citigroup, the majority stake-
holder of KorAm bank.
If successful, both banks
will be competing for retail
banking and credit services to
small- and mid-cap firms. The
50% stake that HSBC hopes
to acquire by 2005 is currently
held by Newbridge Capital,
the US investment fund, who
intend to release it for $3bn.
The current negotiations
are remarkably similar to
those in 1999, when HSBC
Holdings Ltd sought to pur-
chase Korea First as whole,
but was unwilling to trans-
fer the amount the Korean
government demanded. Now,
though, HSBC has resumed
its interest and it seems the
explosive growth of the Asian
markets is the driving force
behind such an acquisition.
Korean First Bank announced
third-quarter net profits of
$30bn, a jump of 76% from
2003.
Credit card ruling
A high court ruled last
week that purchases made
abroad on credit cards would
not be protected under the
Consumer Credit Card Act of
1974.
The act, which allows con-
sumers to claim compensa-
tion for transactions under
£30,000 if their contract is not
honoured, item is wrongly
described or does not arrive,
will no longer be applicable
outside the UK. The beau-
ty of this act, and the credit
card suppliers’ detestation of
it, is that the cardholder can
claim compensation directly
from the card issuer rather
than the firm itself. This led
UK credit card providers to
report spiralling liability costs
overseas and resulted in last
week’s victory against the
Office of Fair Trading, who
will now appeal against the
ruling.
The case, brought to the
court by Tesco Finance, Amex
and Lloyds TSB, however,
had the purpose of remov-
ing final resting liability with
card issuers in order to pre-
vent mounting losses, espe-
cially with regards to online
transactions, which also form
a part of this case. At the
moment, the main dilemma
for firms is to protect custom-
ers from high risk, high value
products bought from unrep-
utable sources overseas while
also trying to lower costs and
hence customer charges.
Last week’s judgement
means that consumer pro-
tection is at the discretion of
the firm and depends on its
goodwill towards consum-
ers, both of which will be left
unchanged by the ruling by
at least two banks, HSBC and
the Bank of Scotland.
Evolution goes extremist
on short selling
Evolution Securities, former-
ly Evolution Beeson Gregory,
was last week fined £500,000
for extrapolating it’s strat-
egy of short-selling, a meth-
od used by brokers to issue
shares in advance of owning
them.
Although this is perfectly
legal, one broker at Evolution
took it to such an extreme
that she sold two and a half
times the total share issue
capital. The FSA came down
on Evolution after several
investors’ complaints of not
receiving shares and for the
first time in the UK fined a
firm for ‘market distortion’, a
form of market abuse.
The most significant con-
sequence of this regulatory
advance by the FSA is that
individual investors are now
more protected in this sector,
thus balancing the deprecia-
tion in protection from over-
seas purchases!
Irate Irish
The Consumer’s Association
(CA) has announced a ‘super
complaint’ after realising
that, year after year, the Irish
banks are consistently over-
charging their customers in
comparison to their UK coun-
terparts.
Although consumer edu-
cation, including knowing
where to look and to shop
around, is partly to blame for
the superfluous charges, the
primary reason is simply that
the top four Northern Ireland
(NI) banks are placing their
charges within three pence
of each other. The banks, who
own amongst them 80% of
the total market share, have
no extra costs or significant
overheads that force them to
have such charges and are
abusing their position in NI.
For instance, a two week
overdraft for £500 would cost
£29 in the UK and £189 in NI,
and cashing a cheque is free
in the UK and at least 42p
in NI.
This has frustrated the CA
who can now expect a decision
by the Office of Fair Trading
within two weeks due to the
enhanced ‘super complaint’
nature of the reporting.
