Fancy a job in TV?
By Cassandra Aldrich
Careers Editor
One sector that probably sur-
passes all others in terms of
competitiveness is the media.
Its ever-increasing influ-
ence and technology-driven
expansion means there are a
number of diverse jobs within
the industry, which appeal to
a great many people.
To find out how best to
break into this media world, I
got hold of an insider, who pri-
marily works as a television
editor but also makes his own
documentaries. Rather than
working directly for a com-
pany, he is employed by direc-
tors or producers to work on
different projects.
Despite finding success (no
small feat in television), mak-
ing good money and working
on some interesting assign-
ments, he spent the first part
of the conversation trying
hard to put me off. I then
managed to gain some good
advice for anyone who wants
to get into television.
Prior experience before
applying for a position is a
necessity, not only as evi-
dence of commitment, but
also because you can’t expect
to be trained from scratch on
the job – there are too many
people who want the job,
most of whom will have the
expertise. So how do you go
about climbing the first rung
and getting the experience?
If you’re extremely lucky
you may be able to secure
an internship with a company
like the BBC or Granada, but
even for this you will need to
have done something as evi-
dence of keen interest.
A good way is to take a
three-step approach – the first
step being to get involved with
the university media groups.
University societies are open
to all, so this is a sure way of
gaining some basic experi-
ence, requiring only that you
devote some time. The next
step would be to do some vol-
untary work for a small, inde-
pendent film-making group.
A couple of websites contain
information about groups
making low-budget documen-
taries or shortfilms (check
out www.shootingpeople.org
and www.dfglondon.com).
Ringing up and offering
your services may get you
involved, but don’t expect to
be paid or have an exciting
role initially. You may also
need a substantial amount
of free time, so it’s probably
best to line something up for
the summer holidays. Finally,
after building up your skills
base and CV, you will be bet-
ter equipped to go after the
particular placement or job
you want, perhaps with a
company or large media cor-
poration.
Television is a pretty small
world in terms of the peo-
ple who control and run it,
which is another reason for
not going into a big company
when inexperienced – it will
get around if you’ve done
a bad job, which would be
career suicide before you’ve
even started. The same
applies to radio and news
publications – be prepared
to start small and then work
your way up.
A course in media or jour-
nalism is not a prerequisite to
work in the industry – many
in the business have such a
degree, but many also don’t.
As experience will quickly
bring non-media gradu-
ates up to speed on how it
all works, the main advan-
tage of the good courses is
that they’ll assist students to
secure work placements.
Motivation, of course, is
essential – ringing up com-
pany switchboards, asking
to speak to the production
managers of particular pro-
grammes, and then una-
shamedly selling yourself is
often the best way to get your
foot in the door. It’s more a
case of actively seeking work
rather than just applying for
job postings. Hold off phon-
ing the production manager
of your favourite programme
until you have something to
offer them.
Another tip I was given is
to learn a technical skill, such
as editing, vision or sound-
mixing, even if you dream
of directing your own films.
Technical skills are more
in demand, and people with
such skills often get paid bet-
ter than the directors them-
selves. Once through the
door, you may then move into
another area, but you’ll still
be more employable with an
additional skill.
If you’re still determined
to work in the media then
prepare yourself for making
cups of tea, being broke for
the first few years, having to
sometimes work on projects
you hate, continual knock
backs, and sadly, at the end
of it all, no assurances of suc-
cess. After all the gloom I
should mention the flip-side,
but it speaks for itself – who
isn’t somewhat allured by the
idea of television and film?

Finding recruiters offering
graduate schemes is relative-
ly easy, especially at Imperial,
surely one of the universities
most loved by employers.
Following the time-hon-
oured principle that you
should ‘try before you
buy’, recruitment fairs and
employer presentations are
a great chance to get an
opinion before you leap into
employment with a company.
Their presentations are also
a great opportunity to talk to
young graduates who were
probably struggling to make
the same job choices as you.
By the end of a presentation,
you should know whether you
want to work for the firm and
will have collected enough
information to commit your-
self and make it through the
first step.
As promised, here is an in-
depth overview on Procter &
Gamble, developed by attend-
ing their corporate presen-
tation here at Imperial. To
be honest with you, I had no
intention to get such accurate
knowledge of the company,
and my interest in P&G was
solely to inform you about the
event. Well, I have to say you
never know what is in store,
and although the company
was not in my top 10 origi-
nally, it became so at the end
of the evening.
I found the company very
challenging and this aspect
captured me straight away,
being myself an ambitious
person. The presentation was
followed by an informal gath-
ering, which is the most help-
ful part of the event. It was
during this informal chat that
I got my name down on their
list of ‘strong’ candidates and
this is the way my involve-
ment with P&G started.
I will not go into many
details about the company, as
you will get bored if P&G does
not stimulate your curiosity;
instead, I am going to high-
light aspects that can be use-
ful to you whichever company
you choose to go for.
For a start, what do they
look out for throughout their
selection process? They talk
about Success Actions for
Winning (SAWs), such as
Leadership, Innovation, Risk
Taking and Mastery to name
a few. The P&G communi-
ty consists of nearly 98,000
people working in almost 80
countries worldwide, pro-
viding branded products as
Pampers, Pringles, Bounty,
Olay and Pantene. Their phi-
losophy is that people are the
foundation of their success:
“If you took away all our fac-
tories, all our money, but left
our people, we would rebuild
the entire organization within
10 years. If you left all of our
possessions and took away
only our people, we would be
completely destroyed”.
There are plenty of pos-
sibilities for careers: you
can choose from marketing,
finance, information tech-
nology and sales to human
resources, product supply
and research and develop-
ment.
Following my research
about the company and their
purposes, principles and val-
ues, I was invited to a ‘Get
in Touch’ recruitment event
at a bar in London. This
kind of event aims to give
you the opportunity for some
one-to-one contact with P&G
employees and to establish a
single point of contact for the
future application process. It
was quite a good experience,
and awkward at the same
time, seeing your potential
employers in a different envi-
ronment.
During the evening, I made
sure I was clear on the appli-
cation process and its dead-
line, and I also gained a better
feeling of the people and the
atmosphere within the com-
pany.
As part of their recruit-
ment process, I was then
invited to a one day Business
Skills course as well at their
Headquarters in Weybridge
near the P&G building. The
day was very challenging and
productive as I learnt a lot
about the company through
their presentations on lead-
ership and objective setting,
advertising and advance com-
munication skills.
I had an insight into the
company vision and strategy
that made it easier for me
to fill in the application form
afterwards, knowing exactly
what people they are looking
for. We were then taken for a
tour in the P&G main building
where you could even smell
and taste the Pringles!
The application form asked
for clear examples of times
when you have worked in
a team or made a difficult
decision. After submitting a
first part, they send you a
multiple choice questionnaire
back, focused more on your
personality as an individual.
An important tip is to apply
first for an internship (if an
undergraduate) or for one of
their courses (if doing a PhD)
because 90% of the people
they recruit for jobs are from
these programmes.
They want a well-rounded
candidate who can clearly
show evidence of the skills
developed from extra-cur-
ricular activities, beyond the
academic records. They want
to hear about your achieve-
ments in clubs and societies,
voluntary and community
work and paid work. They
want to see a person capable
of making a significant differ-
ence. Working for them will
take you almost anywhere in
the world and joining their
Go, Give and Grow (GGG)
scheme you will take part in
a humanitarian project. Most
likely, you will be based in a
developing country for one
year with a salary, working as
partofaprojectteamaddress-
ing global health issues.
I hope my experience will
have stimulated your curi-
osity and given you just a
glimpse of what it could be
like working at P&G.
Like Pringles? P&G could be for you
