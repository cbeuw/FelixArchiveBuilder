UNSIGNED
There’s no messing about, The
Healing Fields set their agenda as
soon as they launch into opener
Cold Crystal Heart. Upbeat and
uplifting, it’s described to me by the
band as “a pop classic”.
It’s certainly catchy, but the use
of the word ‘pop’ is a brave one.
The justification for this is probably
Beric’s voice, which is smooth and
powerful. There’s nothing unfash-
ionable about this; take away The
Music’s Robert Harvey’s northern
accent, take away his band of gurn-
ing baggies, and essentially he is
a pop singer. Most singers in most
indie bands are pop singers, only
more introverted.
So why are they not a ‘pop band’?
Well, they write interesting songs,
they are all very proficient musi-
cians, and... oh yeah, they’re not a
Pop Band because of Simon Herd’s
guitar. This is proper rock guitar,
and the distorted sound is the glue
that stops the melodies being too
sugary. Not only does it fill the gaps,
but when he plays guitar solos in
indie songs it gives the band their
identity. In set closer and EP lead
track Sunrise there is an amaz-
ing riff that’s played throughout
the song, and the almost excessive
choppiness of the endings are both
aurally and visually effective.
They know when to turn it down
as well, such as on the sublime
Clutching At Straws, where Dom
(acoustic guitar/keyboards) picks
out a gorgeous acoustic guitar part
below Beric’s floating vocals and
Leanna’s light drums. What makes
the band work is how the parts come
together, such as in Know Your
Peace where Simon’s guitar part
could be northern rock upstarts The
Open, Damian’s bass and Dom’s
piano are bouncy, and Beric’s vocals
are rich and mellow. And then it all
comes together to sound like, well,
The Healing Fields.
To sum them up, essentially they
are an indie band with a pop singer
and a rock guitarist. And it works,
which is an amazing thing, and
deserving of accolade in itself. Add
to that the fact they write songs with
personality and individuality, and it
can only be a matter of time before
they’re walking all over every boring
garage band in London.

SINGLE REVIEWS
Why The Open never released the
more rocking tracks from their
debut album The Silent Hours
has always confused me. Granted,
Close My Eyes and Just Want To
Live were amazing slices of emo-
tive indie, but Elevation was just
pap. So at last they have released a
song that sounds like all the
best bits from their album
condensed into two minutes 48
seconds.
Never Enough is actually a re-
issue of a much earlier song, and is
by far their best single to date. The
guitars are spiky, and they make
good use of the ever-effective rhythm
slash. The chorus could be used as a
definition for the word ‘anthemic’ in
some bizarre audio dictionary. They
make so much noise combined with
so much melody, it really is astound-
ing.
They just can’t do wrong, these
northern lads. Even the nine minute
long B-side Begin is brilliant, with
1001 things going on at once, and
a space-rock stylee build up in the
middle. I wait with anticipation to
see where they will go next.
James Millen
This is the most awful aural torture I
have ever subjected myself to.
What’s probably a positive about
She Wants To Be Me is the fact that
it is unmemorable. The song just
occurs and luckily avoids any of
those painful catchy hooks that this
“band” produce. If she wants to be
him then she has pathetic aspira-
tions in life.
The B-side is a live version of this
song that is as equally pointless as it
is superfluous. Maybe the label real-
ised how much of a non-entity the
song is that it had to repeat it just
to remind you, yes, that was a song
that just happened. There’s even a
line “Somebody notice, somebody
notice me!” Is this about the girl or
the song?
Putting down Busted is a popu-
lar pastime, so if you need more
ammunition to fire at said bushy
eyebrowed band then put this in
your stereo. From the first predict-
able drum roll opening to the ‘Yeah,
we’re heavy! (in a Darkness kind
of way)’ ending, I can’t begin to
express my distaste at these three
boychildren taking turns to flog the
dead horse that is pop-punk. But
they do have pretty smiles.

The Healing Fields are a five-piece
from London, and their melody-
driven, rich indie has been getting
them noticed. They recently won
best unsigned band in London
at a competition at Sound in
Leicester Square, and they topped
an unsigned band chart for six
weeks. They take their name from
the Glastonbury field, and say
they wanted a name that encapsu-
lated the festival spirit. The band
formed in January 2003, mainly
playing in London, but they have
also played the Castle Rock festi-
val in Cornwall and Pride on Tyde
in Newcastle. They are prolific
writers of material, and have just
headed into the same studio as
white noise merchants My Vitriol
to record their debut EP
. And Paul
Gambaccini’s a fan!

LIVE REVIEWS
There is something wonderful about
Nick Cave: his svelte, ageless figure
with that jet black mop and those
angst-ridden lyrics penetrating into
the deepest recesses of the soul.
If there is one word to sum up his
performance last Friday, the last of
the three London shows, it is this:
thrilling.
Following the opening by the ethe-
real sounding Mercury Rev, the dark
prince and his twelve-strong Seeds
(including a choir of four) took the
stage for a night to remember.
The first set of songs were all from
the newly released double album
Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus
(at least this is my assumption as I
am ashamed to say that I did not
know any). With my mental note-
book working overtime, particularly
noteworthy were Abattoir Blues (to
open), There It Goes, My Beautiful
World, and Easy Money with Nick at
home on piano. The songs sounded
well rehearsed and carefully placed,
all building up into amazing crash-
ing crescendos. Also here was The
Lyre Of Orpheus, spoken as only
Nick Cave can, with dark and deep
choruses of “oh mama” emanat-
ing from the choir. I may not have
known the new album before the
gig but I do now: Nick Cave sold it
to me hands down. Incidentally, I
am also now the proud owner of one
Lyre Of Orpheus tea towel with all
the lyrics.
On stage Nick certainly had pres-
ence, and he knew how to use it.
Dressed in a beautifully cut suit
with a fitted white shirt, he did
indeed look rather dashing as he
moved about the stage with angular,
electric style. As a fellow admirer in
the audience kept shouting: “Nice
ass, Nick”.
I’d offer praise too for his ability
to sing and chain-smoke simultane-
ously (he must have gone through a
small packet of fags while on stage):
the consummate professional.
In the second set, things got a
little more raw as he left the newer
material to give us the old favour-
ites we craved, and it was nice (I
secretly admit) to recognise some
of the songs. The powerful Red
Right Hand, Deanna, with violinist
Warren Ellis working overtime, and
The Weeping Song were featured
here. There is nothing quite like
hearing your favourite lyrics live
and Nick did it so perfectly, so effort-
lessly. The tongue-in-cheek parody
God Is In The House sounded very
fine as my favourite lines rang out:
“We’ve bred all our kittens white
so you can see them in the night”.
Nick, at one point, was in a whisper
and the audience craned to take
it in.
While my companion, Julie, and
I wished he had played more of the
songs we knew, for someone with
so many albums (19, no less) there
was a lot to choose from. Nick Cave
strikes me as someone who likes to
experiment, who might get bored
just belting out hits to an adoring
audience, so it wasn’t a surprise that
a good part of the concert concen-
trated on his new stuff.
There was one more encore before
it was time for us all to pick our
way through the mass of discarded
plastic pint glasses and out into the
cold night. Lastly, with a “Goodbye
London, see you in another couple
of years”, The Mercy Seat got an
airing. It sounded just as it was
meant to, soul food for the depraved,
and the audience was transfixed. I’ll
be there next time, Nick: you rock.
