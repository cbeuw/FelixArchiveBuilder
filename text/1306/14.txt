Will you miss it?
The 360° career.
Graduate deadline – November 28, 2004
Summer Internship deadline – January 30, 2005
We firmly believe that JPMorgan is about the most challenging and rewarding
career choice a talented graduate could make. We call it the 360° career precisely
because it gives you everything: intellectual challenges, tangible impact on the
business and substantial rewards. A word of warning though. The deadline for
applications this year is Sunday November 28, 2004 for graduate positions and
Sunday January 30, 2005 for summer internship positions. So if you don’t visit
360career.com and apply in the very near future, you might never experience it.
Of course, you can’t really miss something you’ve never had. Can you?
