Contrary to the seemingly popular
and – lets face it – egotistical belief
that science has no boundaries, no
frontiers which the human race
can never cross, it appears that
there are inevitable gaps in our
knowledge. From perpetual motion
to unprovable theories such as why
we cannot travel at the speed of light
and our inability to categorically
predict the weather. AK Dewdney
investigates these insurmountable
barriers in his most recent book,
Beyond Reason, mathematically
and physically arguing their impos-
sibility.
Over the course of scientific his-
tory, there have been certain prob-
lems that have been encountered
by scientists of all backgrounds and
from all nations, and they have been
defeated. The Ancient Greeks, for
example, tried to create a cube from
a circle drawn on a sheet of paper,
the cube having exactly the same
surface area as the circle, whilst
limiting themselves to.compasses
and a ruler.. This issue has been
studied by thousands of scientists
who tackled the problem, believing
it a means by which they can win
universal acclaim, and yet each of
them failed. Inevitably, Dewdney
argues, because of transcendental
numbers.
I must admit to having absolutely
no idea as to what transcenden-
tal numbers are. Dewdney does
his best to explain, but the gap in
my knowledge is still resolute. A
strength of Dewdney’s, however,
is his ability to very deliberately
display the method of his work-
ing, and explain the mathemat-
ical ideas upon which his argu-
ment rests. Simply put, the area
of a circle can never be exactly
determined as it depends on pi,,
an irrational and non constructa-
ble number. Therefore the desired
cube is impossible to create. Go
on – give it a go. Instant scientific
acclaim awaits if you succeed.
The construction of the cube from
the circle is one of the eight “great
problems that reveal the limits of
science” investigated by Dewdney.
They are split into two categories:
“Math in the Cosmos” and “Math in
the Holos” (where “cosmos” means
the physical universe in which we
live and “holos” means the entire
universe of mathematics). The one
inductive, the other deductive sci-
ence, these problems are examples
of why we, the human race, will
never be able to elevate ourselves
beyond the realm of impossibility.
Apparently not quite everything is
possible.
The “cosmos” problems were the
more interesting, accessible and
engaging. I found this to be the
case as I am not an expert in the
deeply complicated and sophisti-
cated mathematical theorems
which are more common in the
“holos” problems. Nevertheless
the very notions which are brought
to light are fascinating.
Take perpetual motion, for exam-
ple. This is probably the simplest
of the problems to understand.
Perpetual motion directly contra-
dicts Newton’s law that energy can
neither be created nor destroyed.
For a perpetual motion machine
to exist, it would have to create
energy to enable its chosen type
of motion, whether it be a rotating
wheel or the movement of elec-
trons in a superconducting ring, to
continue undiminished throughout
eternity.
This is, of course, impossible
for the simple reason that resist-
ances to motion (such as friction)
exist, and that energy cannot be
created nor destroyed. Therefore
the perpetual motion machine will
eventually grind to a halt having
exhausted its supply of energy and
been overcome at last by friction.
What I found most interesting
about perpetual motion, however,
was the various attempts by sci-
entists over the years to create a
machine that succeeded in perpetu-
al motion. Dewdney gives a detailed
account of many of the machines
which were built, painstakingly, by
scientists-come-fraudsters. Yet the
variety of the machines concocted
is so impressive that it shows the
ingenuity of our species. The irony
is that the ingenious designs were
merely hoaxes.
The holos problems were the
more mathematically dependent.
Simplicity had to be sacrificed at
the alter of word-limit; no doubt it
would have taken Dewdney hun-
dreds of pages to build up many
of the arguments he makes form
scratch. The most interesting holos
problem was why the long term
behaviour of systems such as the
weather and planetary motion can
never be predicted by any math-
ematical law. The reason for the
enjoyment of this section was the
introduction of Chaos Theory,
something which I have met before
in Jurassic Park (the book, not the
film) through the teachings of Dr.
Malcolm. “A butterfly beating its
wings somewhere in the Amazon
rainforest today will make all the
difference in Holland in a week’s
time between a heavy windstorm
and a nice day.” Sound familiar?
The holos questions should, per-
haps, be reserved for those who
actually know about such things
as strange attractors and nonde-
terministic algorithms (computing
students, that’s one for you). There
is, however, an element of this book
that nags at the subconscious, pos-
ing questions which anyone can
examine and fret over, losing sleep
and sanity.
The idea that poses many prob-
lems for me is: if there is an
exception to every rule, then is
there an exception to that rule? In
other words, if there is an excep-
tion to every rule, and that itself is
a rule, then there must be one rule
to which there are no exceptions.
But that immediately contradicts
the first rule!
One could go around and around
in circles such as this forever
and still come no closer to the
answer. These brainteasers are
ones which only leave a bitter taste
in the mouth, rather than make any
significant difference to science.
Which came first, the chicken or
the egg?
In spite of these questions to
which there seem to be no answer,
a more important idea of this book
is one that it only poses acciden-
tally. (in that it is not a motive of the
book itself). That idea is: what sig-
nificance do these impossibilities
present to science? I have already
made the point that the pursuit of
the perpetual motion machine gave
rise to a wealth of design activ-
ity, the creation of machines which
were ingenious but not for the cor-
rect reason. Will science as a whole
go the same way?
The point may be made that we, as
scientists, have not yet discovered
all the theorems and mathemati-
cal principles which are relevant.
It could be that in four hundred
years time someone will be the
next Newton, or the next Einstein,
and present a branch of mathemat-
ics, hitherto undiscovered, which
changes the complexion of the uni-
verse and our understanding of it. A
branch of mathematics that forces
back the frontiers and undermines
the foundations of the impossible
barriers. Why not? Such a concept
may be idealistic and essentially
ludicrous to us in the twenty-first
century, but why should we be so
arrogant as to assume that every-
thing that can be discovered has
been?
In many ways we are still those
Ancient Greek mathematicians
who believed every number was
rational. This was their belief, a
belief that brought them closer to
the divine ideal of perfection, which
gave them the means by which they
could elevate themselves to the
status of deities. Men being Gods.
Maybe in the future we develop
some means of achieving this. Hey,
if we can’t scale these impossible
barriers, then why not go around
them?
Ultimately these barriers may,
on the one hand, be detrimental
to science. We may as a civilisa-
tion see the top of Everest and
believe we can go no higher. Our
voyage of scientific discovery is
over, and our weaknesses exposed.
A bitter end to the dreams that
nothing is beyond our grasp. On
the other hand these barriers may
be motivating, driving us to over-
come these obstacles by one way
or another and, in doing so, achieve
harmony of science, where all con-
cepts, beliefs and ideals fall into the
arms of a single idea that unites all
aspects of our existence, and pro-
vide the answer to all the questions
we are asking. The achievement of
the Olympian ideal, the elevation
from man to God. But then, since
this voyage of discovery has been
the motivation for thousands of
people over the years, reaching
the end would present the problem
of ‘where do we go from here?’ A
shift of focus to new frontiers and
horizons. Maybe there will be no
end to our labour. Maybe Dewdney
is wrong. Maybe we can climb the
Everest of science, and leap from
the summit like Icarus, soaring
towards the sun.
