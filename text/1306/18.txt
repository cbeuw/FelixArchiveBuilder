The Imperial Medics
Mountaineering Club
(IMMC) has followed on from
the successes of last year
with an awesome Freshers
Meet at the College hut in
Snowdonia.
With bags and buses
packed, 31 brave soles even-
tually set off for ‘the hut’ at
about 7.30 on the evening of
Friday 29 October. The tradi-
tional Friday night curry in
Shrewsbury was postponed
to the early hours of Saturday
morning due to the poor
placement of Birmingham.
Nevertheless, when we got
there, we filled ourselves to
bursting point and managed
to make it to the hut in time
for a couple of hours’ sleep
before rising to the sound
of birds cheeping in the
Snowdonian wilderness.
The cooked breakfast only
took a few hours, and we were
soon on the road to find rocks
and mountains to climb.
One group headed off
to Tremadog for some top-
rope and multi-pitch climb-
ing whilst the rest of us set
off for Snowdon. Half of the
Snowdoneers went up Crib
Goch and the others went up
the far scarier PYG track.
Thankfully, the Welsh weath-
er gods were kind to us and
we all got to the summit safe-
ly and dry. The descent was
slightly colder and wetter due
to the presence of a cold, wet
lake. The prize for the wettest
T-shirt goes to…
Anyway, everyone made it
down safely and proceeded
to the pub where we met up
with the triumphant climbers.
Despite doubling their annu-
al turnover in one evening,
the local publicans were as
hostile as ever. Thanks must
go to club Welshman John
who tried his best to teach us
the Welsh national anthem.
Apologies must also go to
club Welshman John who we
left at the pub by mistake.
Sorry!
Once back at the hut, we
had a wholesome dinner
and tucked into a few more
drinks. Some of us had a few
more. The more responsible
amongst us had a few more.
Those less responsible took
over from the more respon-
sible and thanks must go to
them. Thanks.
Sunday morning was a bit of
a blur but we still managed to
have a fantastic day climbing
at the Pinnacles. New routes
were scaled, bouldering prob-
lems solved and everyone
seemed to enjoy themselves
despite their woolly heads.
We eventually set off for
home and all 31 of us made it
back safely, if rather late, on
Sunday night.
Thanks to everyone who
went, especially the 17 fresh-
ers who really got stuck in
and made the weekend a
success. Hopefully you had a
good time and it’d be great to
see you again.

IMMC freshers brave the mountain hut
Medics, mountaineers and a minibus
By Nacho Quinones
Many of you have probably
gone on holiday to Spain. Why
not? Great country, great food
and brilliant people! But what
happens when the Spanish
come to London? There’s so
much to take in: the rain, fish
and chips, sunset at half four
in the evening, beans on toast,
cockney rhyming slang and
so on. These are just a few
of the factors that contribute
to the tremendous culture
shock that we poor Spaniards
get when we first arrive.
To be fair, it takes some
getting used to, and a feeling
of homesickness is somewhat
unavoidable when one stops
and thinks of beautiful, sunny
Spain. Fortunately, London
is a great place and there’s
so much to do that this is
not a great problem, however
every now and then I have
found myself in the mood for
some good Sangria, dancing
a little Pachanga or eating
decent paella. Not necessar-
ily all at the same time, but
you know what I mean!
Anyhow, these and any
other Spain-cravings that
you might have are what
the Spanish Soc is here for!
We want to bring a bit of the
Spanish way of life to London,
so that us Españoles will get a
bit of home away from home,
and everyone else can get a
taste of what being Spanish is
all about.
So far this year, we’ve had
a couple of really cool par-
ties and meetings where
everyone’s had an excellent
time and even learnt a bit of
Spanish (seriously, you drink
a bit and you’re suddenly
bilingual!)
The Day of the Dead party,
organised with our mates
from the LatAm soc, for
instance, was great! We hired
a club out and near enough
took over the place to organ-
ise a Hallowe’en party, Latin
style! That is with some san-
grias here, some señoritas
there, and a good time all
around! I for one was out of
my tree and I wasn’t the only
one – someone must have
woken up wearing a random
sombrero!
We then organised anoth-
er party last weekend. This
time, it was planned as a typi-
cal Spanish party, without the
stereotypes, and it turned out
to be a pretty random one!
We had a small bouncy castle
that proved to be a success
amongst the smokers, and a
mysterious smoke machine
that actually popped out of
nowhere for a short time
and then left us, never to be
seen again... spooky! Overall,
the result was a completely
crazy night, a whole bunch
of newly acquainted couples
and a good time in general.
But just in case that’s not
enough fiesta for you people,
we’ll be organising a couple
of new events soon.
Look out for our upcoming
boat party! This is a recurring
event, organised by a bunch
of the mediterranean socie-
ties as well as the Latin peo-
ple (we can’t get enough of
‘em). We’ve hosted this event
for a couple of years now and
it’s always turned out to be a
big success and a good laugh.
If you want to know more,
email ignacio.quinones@ic.
ac.uk and I’ll put you on the
mailing list.
Of course, we have good
parties but we do organise
other stuff! We’ve been to a
couple of pubs and met up
with a few people who want-
ed to improve their language
skills. So we’ve made some
new friends in these little lan-
guage sessions, but we’re not
always that friendly! We’re
looking forward to meeting
our rivals in the upcoming
five-a-side world cup and
we won’t be easy on you!
Speaking of football, coming
up this Sunday is THE match:
Real Madrid vs Barcelona,
the clash of the titans! We’ll
see you in the pub for it; look
out for the loud group!
