The manifestos
Elections elections@ic.ac.uk
Vote... again!
Due to the recent success
of ‘Re-Open Nominations’
(RON), there are new elec-
tions to various positions with-
in Imperial College Union.
These four pages tell you
what those positions are, and
who is standing. In printing
their manifestos, we’ve given
each candidate the chance to
explain why you should vote
for them.
You can vote online at www.
union.ic.ac.uk/elections from
tomorrow (Friday 19) until
Friday 26 November. Use
your vote and help to ensure
that Imperial College Union
represents you in the best
way possible.
All the elections are run
using the Single Transferable
Vote system. This means that
you rank the candidates in
order of preference. Firstly,
votes are counted according
to first preferences, and the
candidate with the smallest
number of votes is eliminat-
ed. Votes for this candidate
are then reallocated accord-
ing to second preferences. If
your first choice candidate is
knocked out, your vote trans-
fers to your second choice,
and so on.
In each election, ‘Re-Open
Nominations’ (RON) is treat-
ed as a candidate. If RON
wins then nominations will be
re-opened and there will be a
new election. There is also a
new ‘abstain’ option.
Each voter will be given the
opportunity to donate 25p of
Union funds to a club or soci-
ety of their choice.
● Quiz the candidates at
Hustings in the JCR today
(Thursday 18) at noon.
● Manifestos may be edited
for length, but not for spelling
or grammar.

Hi everyone my name is
DeniceandI’maBiochemistry
student from Hong Kong. I
was captain of my debating
team, school prefect and vice-
chairman of class association
at my old school so I am good
at handling responsibility and
teamwork. I am a good listen-
er and I will value everyone’s
opnions and make sure they
gets reflected to tailor the
needs of Imperial students.
Please vote for me so that I
get a chance to stand for you.
MING HON BRIAN CHEUNG
My name is Ming Hon Brian
Cheung from the Aeronautics
(1st year). I’d like to take this
opportunity to be a part of
the Services Committee as
an ordinary member. I’ve
always wanted to take part
in something that is worth
while as well as having the
chance to serve the others.
Also to learn valuable skill
and to gain experience that
is not provided from my aca-
demic course.
Although I’m a fresher, I’ve
had experience in organis-
ing activities, meetings in my
church as a group leader.
I will, most certainly to
pay 110% effort to serve the
Services Committee.
DAN LEHMANN
Why vote for me? I have lots
of knowledge as to how the
union works. I have been a
member of House Committee
before and importantly, am
not a member of DramSoc, so
I do have other users of union
facilities at mind.
I have also sat on Services
Committee for just over
2 years, and know a great
deal about the minibuses, as
well as how this committee
works.
Last year I observed on
Trading Committee, in which
I put together a paper on loy-
alty cards with another mem-
ber. Vote for me, because I
know what to do.
PHILLIP GILLILAND
I believe that I would make
a positive contribution to the
Trade and Retail Committees
should I be elected. I am very
approachable and friendly
and would ensure that your
views are heard. I believe
that the College should strive
to integrate FairTrade into its
policies as this would enhance
its reputation as a free and
equitable institution, and will
therefore campaign for the
incorporation of FairTrade
policies when the catering
contract is reviewed at the
end of the year.
