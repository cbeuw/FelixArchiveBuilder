Issue 1305 solution

By Ben Anstiss
Imperial College Boat Club
entered a grand total of ten
crews in this years Fours
Head race across seven cat-
egories. This included three
women’s crews, who, along
with the men, raced the Head
course from Chiswick Bridge
to Putney Pier between 10am
and midday last Saturday. 550
crews from around the world
took part, with a mixture of
Olympic, international, club
and academic (both school
and university level) rowers
competing over the four mile
time trial.
Imperial’s top boat, a Senior
1 quad, had the audacious
honour (or outrageous mis-
fortune as some may see it)
to set off 13th, but finished
third in their category behind
Molesey and London in a time
of 19 minutes 26.94 seconds.
The Senior 2 coxless four
were beaten into second
place by Henley Rowing Club
by a margin of less than 7.5
seconds with an overall time
of 19min 46.26sec.
There was a similar story in
the Senior 2 coxed four event,
where Imperial were once
again forced into the second
slot, this time by Isis (Oxford
University’s official boat club)
in a time of 20min 18.03sec.
The women’s Senior 2 quad
performed well, finishing
7th in their category behind
some very stiff competition
in the form of ex-Olympians
and international level row-
ers. The other two women’s
crews performed admirably
in the Senior 3 coxed fours,
coming 10th and 11th over-
all with barely ten seconds
between them.
In what is becoming a
familiar theme for this race,
the curse of the Fours Head
struck again, this time in the
Senior 3 coxed four category
where Imperial came second
behind Oxford Brooks in a
time of 20min 40.97sec.
It just goes to prove the old
idiom “bad things come in
threes”. Regardless, all the
crews performed well, with
a few 10th and 11th places
further down the table, all the
more impressive when you
consider that the categories
can contain 60+ crews.
Imperial College School
of Medicine Boat Club also
entered three boats in the
competition, with their first
men’s boat coming 23rd in the
Senior 3 coxed fours event
and, coincidentally, the wom-
en’s crew placing 23rd in the
female equivalent.
Saturday 13 November sees
theImperialCollegeBoatClub
heading down to Cambridge
for our novice squad’s first
race at the Cambridge Winter
Head. Some of the senior
squad are also going down to
race; a full report will appear
in Felix next week.

With Imperial Firsts lying
second in their BUSA
(British Universities Sports
Association) group, the visit
of Bucks’ First team gave the
boys from South Ken a chance
to leapfrog the visitors into
first place with a win.
A blustery day wasn’t going
to provide great football-
ing conditions, and with the
squad reduced by injuries,
this was looking like being a
tough match.
Imperial played the first
half into a stiff breeze, and
to be honest didn’t really look
like scoring. The only move
of note was a Badger run and
blaze over the bar onto the
hockey pitch, but everyone
was playing solidly enough.
Defensively, Joey Mac slot-
ted comfortably into the
Wang’s boots, and Pat ‘Beef’
Farr was solid as ever. Bucks
didn’t take advantage of the
conditions, and the only work
for keeper Von Orfordhausen
were a couple of free kicks
straight at him. Nil-nil at half
time.
After a few stern words from
captain Badger, Imperial set
about trying to dominate the
second half and get the win
that would propel us to the
top. The wind seemed to die
a bit, but we still had the
conditions, and started to put
together some good moves.
A few corners were won and
not utilised, and Badger went
close with a shot from dis-
tance.
Bucks were still a threat
going forward and won more
free kicks around the box, but
the defence stood firm and
didn’t wilt. As time wore on,
Bucks lost more and more
discipline, and holes started
to appear in their defence.
It was through one of these
holes that JR threaded a
sublime pass into the path
of Leigh, on loan from the
Seconds, at the right corner
of the box.
Leigh lined up to spank the
ball across the keeper, but
instead succeeded only in
spanking it straight at Badger
on the penalty spot. The skip-
per seemed to catch the ball,
put it down, then pass it past
the ‘keeper who was out of
position trying to narrow the
angle from Leigh. With the
Bucks players livid at the goal
being allowed to stand, the
Imperial boys celebrated.
DAL came on for Spanish
funboi Benji, and Imperial set
about defending their lead.
Bucks piled on the pres-
sure, with more freekicks
around the box, and Von
Orfordhausen was nailed in
the face by their number 10
as he tried to scoop up the
ball following a corner. In
the end, that was the closest
Bucks came to scoring, and
Imperial were 1-0 victors, tak-
ing them to the top of their
BUSA group.
