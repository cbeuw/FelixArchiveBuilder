After months of being afflict-
ed with a painful verruca on
his foot, my brother had com-
pletely given up all hope of
ever getting rid of it. He’d
tried everything the pharma-
cist could come up with –
bazooka that verruca my foot
(pardon the pun), but alas, it
just was not meant to go.
So I idly started to search
the internet for possible rem-
edies, when I came across
quite a strange idea. The cure
was to tape a piece of banana
skin to the verruca and leave
it overnight.
It sounded totally insane, so
we had to try it out of sheer
curiosity. I cut out some piec-
es of banana skin, stuck them
to his foot with plasters, and
amazingly, the verruca disap-
peared overnight.
We were in awe of the
fact that a banana peel had
done what all these highly
researched and patented
drugs failed to do.
It is because of these so-
called reliable drugs failing,
that more and more people
are turning to natural thera-
pies. There’s also the upside
that they don’t play too many
games with your poor liver
(which probably has enough
problems dealing with alco-
hol anyway).
GlaxoSmithKline’s shares
have plummeted 12% this
year. This has been partly
caused by a lawsuit against
the pharmaceutical giant
claiming they had concealed
information that would have
alerted physicians that the
antidepressant Paxil (Seroxat
in the UK) could be harm-
ful to children or adolescents.
Now, this is not the first time
a major pharmaceutical com-
pany has had a lawsuit filed
against them, and in view
of that fact a recent survey
found that around 70-80% of
US consumers have an inher-
ent mistrust in the industry. A
more local survey suggested
that around one in five people
in the UK have tried at least
one form of complementary
therapy.
Patients are evidently
becoming increasingly aware
of the side effects and limita-
tions of conventional medi-
cines, and consequently,
more and more are turning
to complementary therapies.
Complementary medicine
often focuses on the entire
individual, rather than spe-
cifically targeting their afflic-
tions. Diet, environment
and lifestyle are also taken
into account along with the
mental, emotional and spir-
itual health of the patient.
The treatment aims to not
only cure the disease, but to
promote an overall sense of
well-being, hence preventing
the patient from a relapse.
Patients are often actively
involved in their treatments.
Rather than being prescribed
a generic drug, the treat-
ments are very much per-
sonalised to fit the patient’s
lifestyle.
Most complementary ther-
apies are based on the idea
that the body has a natural
ability to treat any disease,
but just needs a kick start,
so treatments often aim to
stimulate this natural healing
ability in the body.
There are five main comple-
mentary therapies - acupunc-
ture, osteopathy, chiroprac-
tic, homeopathy and herbal-
ism. Other popular therapies
include naturopathy (natural
remedies like sunlight, diet
and massage), aromathera-
py and massage. There are
also more unusual therapies
involving things like magnets
and crystals. Other cultures
have whole disciplines of
complementary therapies,
ayurvedic medicine from
India, for example.
In acupuncture, fine, sterile
needles are gently inserted
into selected points on the
skin, known as acupoints.
This is said to balance the
flow of vital energy (Qi, pro-
nounced ‘chee’) in the body
and regulate organ function.
Research has shown that
acupuncture actually triggers
the release of endorphins in
the brain, so even though it
sounds painful, it is actually
reducing pain! Thousands
of acupuncture studies have
been carried out all over
the world, showing it to be
effective for a wide range of
ailments including asthma,
headaches, menstrual prob-
lems, digestive problems and
high blood pressure. It is also
increasingly being used in
obstetrics and has been found
to reduce morning sickness
and ease labour. The World
Health Organisation recog-
nises over a hundred condi-
tions that can be helped by
acupuncture.
According to osteopathic
theory, the musculoskeletal
structure of the body and
its function are closely con-
nected, and so spinal imbal-
ance can lead to discomfort
and disease. Correcting
the imbalance and improv-
ing the range of movement
can therefore both ease pain
and improve organ function.
It was Dr. Andrew Taylor
Still who devised a system
of manipulation techniques
known as osteopathy to rebal-
ance the framework of the
body, improve joint mobility
and allow proper function of
the internal organs. Daniel
David Palmer, a gifted ama-
teur practitioner, believed
that disease was a result of
the nervous system function-
ing abnormally. He developed
techniques for relaxing the
spinal muscles and freeing
the body’s natural healing
energy, and this system of
therapy became known as
chiropractic. Osteopathy and
chiropractic are collectively
known as manipulation tech-
niques.
These techniques have
been shown to be beneficial
for joint and back problems,
especially lower back pain,
neck stiffness and knee prob-
lems. It can also help relieve
headaches and ear, nose and
throat problems. Some osteo-
paths and chiropractors also
treat general health prob-
lems such as digestive dis-
orders, menstrual imbalance
and urinary disturbance.
Homeopathy is essen-
tially fighting fire with fire.
It was first discovered by
Dr. Hahnemann, who was
distressed by the barbaric
medical methods of his time
(bleeding, purging, and leech-
es). He observed that the cin-
chona bark, which was then
being used to treat malaria,
had toxicological effects if
given to a healthy person.
The bark often produced
attacks of fever, very simi-
lar to the malaria fever. But
when small doses of the bark
were administered to malaria
patients, the malaria fevers
were reduced. Hahnemann
deduced that infinitesimal
doses of substances which
would cause symptoms in a
healthy person were capable
of curing similar symptoms
in a sick person.
Tiny doses of plant, animal
ormineralextractsaresoaked
in alcohol, diluted and shak-
en vigorously. The patient is
then advised on dosage. The
more a substance is diluted,
the stronger its therapeutic
effect and potency is thought
to be. No one knows exactly
how homeopathy works, but
some studies have shown that
extremely diluted amounts of
poisons like arsenic and lead
can help remove the actual
poison from the cells and
reduce its harmful effects.
In a famous, but controver-
sial study, the French pro-
fessor Jacques Beneviste
claimed to show that even
when a substance is so dilut-
ed that it can no longer be
detected, it can still somehow
influence living cells. In a
later study he found that this
effect only occurs if the sub-
stance has been vigorously
shaken and not if it has been
frozen or overheated. Other
recent studies suggest that
water may be able to carry
a ‘memory’ of the original
substance. Homeopathy has
been shown to be effective
in the treatment of hay fever,
asthma, skin disease, colds
and flu, high blood pressure,
whooping cough, insomnia,
irritable bowel and depres-
sion.
Every ancient civilisation
has used plants for healing
purposes, and herbal medi-
cine is probably the most
ancient form of medicine in
the world. Around three quar-
ters of the world’s population,
especially those in develop-
ing countries, rely on herbal
medicine - and almost a quar-
ter of all modern prescription
drugs, are derived from plant
sources, aspirin from willow
bark, for example. Recently,
it was found that green tea
is particularly potent in fight-
ing cancer, and work is being
done to extract the particular
chemical agent responsible.
The stems, leaves, flowers,
roots, bark, berries, fruits and
seeds of plants can be used to
make a medicine. The medic-
inal part of the plant is har-
vested or extracted and then
either dried for use in teas or
made into ointments, pow-
ders, pills, capsules, lozenges
or liquid tinctures. Different
herbs have been shown to
be useful for a wide variety
of conditions, for example,
echinacea and goldenseal are
known to boost the immune
system and garlic is used by
many individuals as a protec-
tion against atherosclerosis,
coronary thrombosis, stroke
and even some types of can-
cer.
With more and more people
taking an interest in their own
health, complementary ther-
apies will continue to become
increasingly popular. As well
as other benefits, it’s also just
far easier to purchase a box
of echinacea tea than try and
haggle some antibiotics from
the pharmacist (not that I’ve
tried).
Even trained medics are
slowly taking an interest.
Psychiatrists are using hyp-
notherapy, anaesthesiolo-
gists are getting help from
acupuncture and physiother-
apists are using acupres-
sure and reflexology. There
are so many aspects of our
nature that modern medicine
ignores (particularly non
physiological effects), that
it seems inevitable that the
tide will turn towards holistic
health.
Natural therapy making a comeback
With growing public anger both here and in the US at the practices of pharmeceutical
companies, Anushri Patel explains the benefits of alternative complementary therapy
“Most complementary
therapies are based on
the idea that the body
has a natural ability to
treat any disease... so
treatments often aim to
stimulate this natural
healing ability”
“GlaxoSmithKline’s
shares have plummeted
12% this year following
a lawsuit... claiming
they had concealed
information”
Acupuncture needles are replacing syringes in the treatment of a wide range of diseases
Ancient medicine focuses on keeping the body at one with
its environment to promote an overall sense of wellbeing
“As well as other
benefits, it’s just also
far easier to purchase
a box of echinacea tea
than try to haggle some
antibiotics from the
pharmacist”
