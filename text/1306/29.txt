Hello, I’m back again. Thanks to
everyone who sent in questions
about my last puzzle (issue 1303)
– they’re always welcome. Apologies
to anyone confused by the clue
for BEAUTY, which relied on an
obscure piece of particle physics:
‘bottom’ quarks are also known as
‘beauty’ quarks.
Now for a look at a couple more
tricks of the trade. Sometimes the
answer is built up not by adding
some strings to others, but by sub-
tracting some strings from others,
as in 11 across this week. Other
clues involve the substitution of one
string for another, as in 8 down. In
both cases, the strings may be indi-
vidual letters or whole words.
Good luck! Snufkin

Send your answers to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk or bring this page down to the Felix office in

Ugly XI
It’s England v Spain on Wednesday
night, sorry, yesterday night, and so
a football themed quiz is in order.
Have a look at our team of mingers
(below left) and just tell us who’s
who.
The ugly XI comprimises five
British players, two Brazilians, an
Argentinian, a German, an American
and a Stinky Frog. No offence to our
Gallic cousins.
And an ugly team needs an ugly
manager, so if you could name him
too, that’d be great.
Hopefully you should be able to
work out who these guys are. When
you have, send us your answers to
the usual address.

UPDATE
The Felix Unforgettable Coffee-
Break Weekly Issued Tournament
is hotting up. Well, a little. The
Management Slackers team are
storming into a bit of a lead this
week, having proved their exten-
sive knowledge of ladies’ bits, and
George W Bush quotes.
This week’s quizzes are nice and
simple. There’s two points for each
correct answer, giving a huge total
of 38 points to get.
So, the answers for issue 1304:
Whose breasts are these?
These were dead easy – we’re
suprised you guys didn’t do better.
Homework next week: Buy Zoo,
Nuts and FHM and memorise what
you see – The Breasts may return.
Anyway, the answers were: Carmen
Electra, Justin Timberlake, Louise
Redknapp, Peter Andre, Rachel
Stevens, Christina Aguilera, Holly
Valance, Britney Spears.
George W Bush is Dumb
He also won the election, much
to the dissapointment of Channel
Four and The Guardian. It’s
almost worth it, just to see the
smug grin wiped off their faces.
Only almost though – four more
years to come, God help us. It was
pretty easy: all the quotes we gave
you were true, he really is that
dumb.
Hello, I’m back again. Thanks to
Snufkin
Enter now!
