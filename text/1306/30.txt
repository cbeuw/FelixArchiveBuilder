Oh dear. Well what we have
here is a little bit of history
repeating. Dedicated readers
of these match reports will
be starting to see a pattern
in their content. So, I’ve said
it before, but I’ll say it again
– what happened? We really
were the stronger team and
did not deserve this defeat.
The problem appears to lie
within the first 20 minutes
of the game, our ‘waking up
time’. For those of you who
are not familiar, ‘waking up
time’ is the period during
which we have to shake off
the morning of journal read-
ing and tutorial sheets and
transform ourselves into the
highly motivated athletes
we truly are. Unfortunately,
on more than one occasion
this term, the opposition has
taken full advantage of our
first-half haze and sneaked a
couple of goals in. And this
was exactly what happened in
the Portsmouth game.
In the first half, Portsmouth
scored two goals, but enough
about them already, so I’ll
move swiftly on to the second
half.
Imperial dominated the
pitch and there was little
play outside Portsmouth’s
half. Tyson, out for blood,
pushed forward with force
and proved to be a brick
wall that the Portsmouth
attack failed to penetrate.
The defence, including man
of the match Yoda, became
honorary midfielders as the
onslaught in the “D” contin-
ued. Around this time, the
Portsmouth goalkeeper (or
maybe a higher force that
felt the need to punish us)
disgracefully began to move
the goalposts, and continued
to do so for the remainder
of the match, proven by the
fact that all shots on said goal
were just a little too wide or a
little too high. Imperial were,
therefore, left goalless.
We have now played all of
the teams in our league, and
although only one victory
has been claimed, we know
each team (maybe with the
exception of St Mary’s) is
beatable.
So the warm-up is over,
bring on round two. The ladies
are on the warpath, hungry
for goal pie, out for revenge.

DeIViant hockey continues

GKT Men’s 2nd 3

Once upon a cold November
day, 13 intrepid adventures,
also known as the almighty
deIViants, made their way
to the fortress Harlington.
Despite starting their sea-
son a month late and being
thrashed by Imperial Medics
Thirds the week before,
spirits in the deIViant camp
were high. After all, we now
had a complete team and
were supposedly playing
‘serious’ league hockey.
After some dynamic “jump-
ing around like skippy the
bush kangaroo on caeffine”
stretching, we began our fight
against GKT Seconds, who
had some suspicious char-
acters from last year’s GKT
third team.
Sadly, unlike last year’s
results, this game did not go
in our favour. The first half
started promisingly but soon
deteriorated into fully-fledged
madness and fiasco with our
amazing 10-0-0 and 0-0-10 for-
mations. Our shameful pen-
alty corner attack also went
into the abyss of infinity and
dark matter that was our own
half!
To top that, Lady Luck was
not on our side either, as GKT
cunningly got two deflections
in and we gave penalties away
in true deIViant fashion. By
half time it was 3-0. Having
had ‘that’ loud Jack git yell-
ing at us for a full 35 minutes,
we now meant business. We
fought back with all our might
and started to attack in the
second half, pissing off Jack
and his pack as much as pos-
sible.
Some spectacular saves
from our new ‘keeper Doug
from the eight short corners
that we faced, together with
fine umpiring from the ladies,
kept us in the game and our
spirits alive. Special mention
also goes to Tight Lips, who
made a guest appearance for
his old team. He shall never
forget his deIViant roots.
Following our match, sev-
eral players got even more
hockey, making cameo
appearances for the Thirds.
Once again our goalkeeper
‘What do you call a man with
a spade on his head’ showed
the skills he gained in his pre-
vious life as goalkeeper and
wicketkeeper as the Thirds
took a mighty drubbing too.
Only the hardcore few
made it to the Union later, and
after some deIViant dancing
our ‘keeper showed that not
only is he good at saving but
he can score pretty finely
too!
All in all, having come back
from our last 9-0 drubbing,
the latest 3-0 scoreline is a
big improvement. We’ll be
back again to deliver deIViant
wrath, so watch this space.
