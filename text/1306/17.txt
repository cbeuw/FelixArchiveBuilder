By Mark Flower
Ten paddlers, three hire
cars, the large expanse that
is British Columbia, and a
collection of rivers that just
cannot be found in Europe: a
recipe for a good summer.
Thanks to the gener-
ous support of the Imperial
College Expedition Board,
we were off to Canada. Early
one morning in August, we
found ourselves at Gatwick
airport, attempting to check
in an inordinate amount of kit
including nine kayaks and full
open canoe. After an eleven
hour monster flight, we found
ourselves in sunny Vancouver
in the middle of a heat wave.
The next morning found us
inMEC(MountainEquipment
Co-op, a fine establishment
that we visited on many occa-
sions) buying even more
stuff. When we finally man-
aged to drag ourselves out of
this shopping paradise sev-
eral hours later, we climbed
into our hire cars and headed
north towards Squamish and
Whistler in search of white
water.
We settled first on the
Elaho, a really big volume
river with large wave trains.
The river proved to be a bit
too much of a challenging
start for some of us, who very
sensibly decided to walk off.
At that point we realised just
how much BC had to offer.
This expedition was going to
be truly awesome.
Over the next few days, we
ran a variety of rivers in the
area. Some were mellow pret-
ty paddles, and some were
blocked by logjams large
enough to make a beaver
blush. One of the most suc-
cessful runs was the middle
Cheakamus, a classy medium
volume run, with one hard-
er drop. As the river is dam
released, some of the boys
spent a while discussing how
to destroy it allowing more
water to be released. Since
Imperial College is not an
international terrorist organi-
sation, nothing was done and
we set off down the river with
its really warm water (going
back to Wales in winter is
going to be a bit of a shock to
the system).
One classic run that was
more challenging was the
upper Cheakamus. This was
thoroughly enjoyed by all who
ran it. Another, Callaghan
Creek, offered great clean
waterfalls, which made up
for the long and arduous
put in. Thankfully an easier
route to the river was even-
tually found, but unfortu-
nately this was only after
the river had actually been
run. The Cal-cheak section
of the Cheakamus was a fun
run which the entire group
enjoyed.
A few days later saw us
heading off the world-famous
Schookumchuck play wave
(one of the top ten play spots
in the world apparently).
Naturally we passed
through Vancouver, and
equally naturally that includ-
ed a stop in MEC. We found
a beautiful camp site on a
secluded, quiet and peaceful
lake, which was perfect for
messing about both in and
out of our boats. The next few
days were spent on the wave.
To get to the wave you have to
walk 3-4km carrying all your
kit. Those of us not paddling
looked very smug. The local
diner served up the biggest
burgers any of us had ever
seen, which refuelled us tired
paddlers.
Leaving our campsite early
on the Wednesday, we stopped
briefly in Vancouver, dropped
in to MEC, and out along the
US-Canadian border, just
managing to squeeze a sec-
tion of the river Chilliwack
in before dark. That evening
was marked by an amazing
meteor shower – unlike any-
thing the south east of the
UK gets. With total darkness
and not a cloud in the sky it
was an evening to remember.
The next day we hooked up
with a local open boater and
ran more of the Chilliwack,
including a very scenic gorge
section.
While some ventured up
to the upper reaches of the
Nahatlach, the rest of us
went off to the Thompson.
The Thompson is a big river
– 600 tonnes of water flowed
down it every second while
we were there. I’ll describe
it as having huge whirlpools,
eddy lines and wave trains.
You can imagine the rest. It
was enormous fun, although
only after I got over the fear
of it.
Monday was Clearwater
day. Vancouver Canoe Club
had recommended it to us.
Although the water was warm
(although not as warm as the
18˚C Nahatlatch), the river
was reasonably flat, with only
two rapids of any note. We
also had spent a long time
at the top of the river, while
Rob fixed the hire car he had
just broken. The Clearwater
was good, but I felt as though
there was something miss-
ing by the time we had hit
the bottom. Rob, Alice and
James made up for it by hav-
ing an impromptu bath. We
towed their boats to the side
for them.
Leaving the Clearwater
the next day, we drove up a
stupid (4x4 only) dirt track
to our next river, the Chilco.
Six in the morning is no time
to be out of bed, unless you
have a very good reason. We
did – the Chilco. We were
camped at the take out, and
even though we left at 6am
it was 12.30 before most of us
got on the water. The roads
were that bad.
The river itself was (and
I’m running out of superla-
tives here) brilliant. The
entry rapid to the river was
huge. Three of us swam down
it – Claire, Harry and myself.
Harry went left (after being
told to go right) while Claire
and I were munched by the
huge waves. Claire had it bad
– after spending the fist half
of the rapid upside down try-
ing to roll (further than me by
all accounts) she swam, and
then spent the second half
of the rapid swimming to the
surface.
Eventually we were all reu-
nited with our kit (Harry hav-
ing dropped his paddle). The
second half of the river was
unique. I have never paddled
anything like it. With large
waves and large piles of water
(so large some of us got com-
pletely airborne as we went
over them), it was awesome.
Coupled with the five or six
brown bears we spotted on
the bank (some within half a
mile of the campsite), it was a
bunch of happy paddlers who
crawled into the camp site
that evening.
Thursday dawned. After
floating down the Chilco to
the main road (in an effort
to make the cars lighter) we
saddled up, and drove off to
the Quesnel. With some great
waves and a memorable
(though short) gorge section,
the river was great and we
arrived back at the campsite,
again, complete with smiles.
On the Friday we ran
the Caribou. It was like the
Quesnel, except for one fea-
ture, a five metre V-shaped
fall. Rob was doing alright
until he reached the flat bit
at the bottom. Then he got
scared and pulled his deck (at
least that’s what it looked like
from the bank...) He main-
tains that the river popped
his deck. We just laughed
and kept filming. All this took
place while the salmon were
trying to leap up the water
fall. None made it.
After driving through the
night, we arrived next to the
Holmes river. This river was
cold, much like Scotland can
be over new year. Fed by
melting glaciers, the water
had little time to warm up,
and we spent much of our
time doing everything in our
power to keep our hands out
of the water – this included
paddling with hands next to
each other in the centre of
the paddle.
Theo also managed to
poach us a couple of salm-
on from the river. We had to
cook them surreptitiously on
the fire, since we had some
fishermen camped next to us
who explained that fishing
Chinook salmon was illegal.
We were a long way north
now, and although it was
still August the weather was
starting to turn against us.
It was getting cold at night.
With less than a week left in
Canada we pressed on, doing
the river Dore. Again, this
was split into two sections
with the upper prosecuted by
the remaining lads. When I
arrived at the road up to the
Dore, we found that the road
bridge had been ripped up
and was in the process of
being replaced. Deciding not
to drive across it we started
walking, meeting the others
higher up. The middle was a
lot of fun, although much like
the Holmes it was really cold.
We met a dude from Quebec
that night, who escorted us
to the upper Fraser. While
the Fraser is truly huge at
Vancouver, further up it is a
good deal smaller (but still
not insignificant in size).
Overlander falls are on this
section. The entire river
drops about 15m into a pool
below. Tim had a picture of
this fall on this bedroom wall
at home, and he stared long
and hard at it. There is a
line down it, but if you screw
it up slightly, it’s bad news.
You can’t be rescued from the
bank, it’s just too big. Tim was
practically sick by the time
he decided to do the sensible
thing and walk around the
fall.
After this we drove for a
bit to the river Canoe (great
name eh?) This is continu-
ous grade three water which
is, again, glacier melt (read
cold). This river did not stop
once. For the entire 6-7km
that we were on the river, you
had to plot every single line.
This river had it all – further
down, it got less continuous
and had a few harder drops
contained within it.
On the Wednesday we
drove to the Lillooet, back
towards Vancouver. Although
we arrived too late to do the
section we drove over a silly
looking river called Pebble
Creek. Obviously it needed
running. The lads then ran
it, although there was only
the one place to stop in 800m.
Tim described it as ‘being
trashed while still upright’.
The Thursday was a spe-
cial day. Usually in Wales
we manage two rivers a day.
Previously on the expedi-
tion we had been managing
one most days. On Thursday
some people ran four. The
pebble was the first. This
time they walked up it a bit
before putting on. Next we
all ran the Lillooet. After this
we drove to the Green, a nice
grade three paddle. It was
fun, aside from the put in,
which required us to paddle
across a dirty great lake first.
Finally a few of the lads ran
the Soo.
The final river we ran (on
the ensuing Friday) was the
Calcheack. This was a repeat
run from when we had run it
previously. I got to do it this
time. Much as it said on the
tin, it was a great run, with a
fantastic play wave halfway
down.
Our time was over. We were
done. Returning to Vancouver
(and naturally enough to MEC
again) we stayed overnight
in the youth hostel before
scattering to the four winds.
Most people flew back on the
Sunday.
We would like to thank the
Imperial College Expedition
Board (www.imperial.ac.uk/
expeditions) who supported
the trip. If you would like to

ing with the easy stuff), see
