Students from the City and
Guilds College Union took
part in London’s annual Lord
Mayor’s Show on Saturday,
designing and building a float
and then accompanying it in
the traditional procession.
The Lord Mayor’s Show is
one of London’s great spec-
tacles. Historically, it marks
the day when the Guilds of
London celebrate their pros-
perity and the Lord Mayor
parades in a flamboyant gold
carriage through the heart
of London’s City district.
Nowadays it is just as colour-
ful and frenetic, and includes
bands, floats, processions,
military parades, a fair in
Paternoster Square and fire-
works on the River Thames.
The procession dates back
almost 800 years and has
marched through the Black
Death (1347) and the Blitz
(1945). The Lord Mayor trav-
els from his offices at Mansion
House to the Queen’s Bench
to pledge his allegiance
to the Crown, just as Dick
Whittington did for the first
time in 1397.
The City and Guilds College
Union (CGCU), the Faculty
Union representing Imperial
College’s 4000 engineers, has
participated in the show over
several decades. The pres-
sure is always on each new
generation of Guildsmen to
live up to past expectations.
This year’s Lord Mayor’s
Showexperiencewasabumpy
ride from start to finish for
CGCU, with confusion over
paperwork, float design and
sponsorship nearly result-
ing in their withdrawal from
the show. However, thanks to
generous support from Smith
& Nephew and Fullers, and
diplomatic background nego-
tiations, preparations were
allowed to resume.
The statistics for this year’s
show are staggering: 6000
participants marched along
three and a half miles of the
historic route through the

Past and present students from the City and Guilds College Union accompany their float through the City of London as
part of this year’s Lord Mayor’s Show
streets of London. Over 70
weird and wonderful floats,
250 vehicles and 235 horses
saluted the Lord Mayor, the
great and the good of the City,
tens of thousands of specta-
tors, and close to three mil-
lion television viewers.
Chris McIver, CGCU Lord
Mayor’s Show Coordinator,
told Felix: “It was a wonder-
ful day with a great atmos-
phere... the turnout was a
huge improvement on previ-
ous years, and in a change to
CGCU tradition the float was
more or less finished with a
whole hour to spare.”
The design and assembly
of the float was, according to
Mr McIver, “a bit of a chal-
lenge”. As a great deal of
sponsorship came from a bio-
engineering company and the
bioengineering department, it
was decided at an early stage
that the design should draw
on influences from advances
made in the bioengineering
research industry. A giant
MRI scanner, three large
paper maché bones and an
oversized wooden heart were
crafted and displayed to the
world, along with ‘Boanerges’,
CGCU’s prize veteran vehicle
mascot.
Steam tractors, tanks,
an enormous turkey, belly
dancers, Bananaman and
Guildsmen all added to the
plethora of colour, heritage
and vibrancy that made this
show so special. City and
Guilds traditions were car-
ried out throughout the day,
notably by Chris Jackson who
bravely carried Spanner, the
64lb CGCU mascot, on his
shoulder for the entire length
of the procession.
It was pleasing to see so
many students, past and
present, participate in the
procession, and to see new
faces involved as well.
“The Lord Mayor’s
show is one of
London’s great
spectacles...”
