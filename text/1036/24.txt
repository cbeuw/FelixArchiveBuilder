Hockey and Rugby Provide
Embarrassment Against Brunei
The first major set of fixtures for the year saw IC's hockey and rugby
teams comprehensively humiliated in matches against Brunei, with only
the ladies' hockey 2nds' pulling off a victory. "We were robbed," claimed
Rachel Curran, speaking of the hockey ladies lst's defeat.
Tim Townend, Deputy President (Clubs and Societies), described the
rugby performance as 'embarrassing', declaring that it was quite a relief to
leave the field to spend the rest of the day in hospital with the 2nd row and
flanker who had a broken cheekbone and misplaced a kneecap. Clearly it
was a successful afternoon, boys.
