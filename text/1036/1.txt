Rag Man Awash with Free Spirit
BY ALEX FEAKES
IC Rag Chair, Richard Willis,
is facing a union disciplinary
committee after giving out free
whisky and vodka at the club's
meeting last Friday.
College security were
alerted after a fresher was found
incapacitated from alcohol on the
Sherfield walkway last Friday
afternoon. The first year
biochemist had been attending
the Rag Freshers' event in the
Union Ents Lounge at lunchtime,
where free shots of spirits where
being offered as incentives to get
involved.
The fresher was found by
the newly appointed Project
Manager of Estates, Ian Frame, in
a 'barely conscious state' outside
the Bookshop. M r Frame,
concerned for the young man's
health, alerted security, and the
fresher was subsequently
escorted to the Health Centre in
Princes Gardens. After
examination, the Health Centre
were satisfied that he was in no
danger and contacted M r Willis
with regards to the incident.
The Rector has been made
aware of the incident, and has
also received a copy of the
security report. Concern at the
levels of student drinking are

drinks were offered to
prospective raggies, a common
practice for freshers' events, and
one endorsed by the Union.
Unusually in this case, the drinks
offered where strong spirits such
as vodka and whisky, not the
normal beer or wine. The spirits
were bought off campus and
consumed at lunchtime, just a
few days after the Union stated
that it did not approve of
lunchtime drink promotions.
Concern has been expressed
as to how the fresher got into
such a state, especially as the
people at the meeting were
limited to two shots of spirits,
one at the beginning and one at
the end. One person said that the
fresher had been acquiring drinks
throughout the meeting, and that
Mr Willis, seeing the fresher was
the worse for drink at the end of
the meeting, advised him not to
have another. The fresher was
later seen buying a pint of strong
cider in Da Vinci's, before being
taken to the JCR 'to find a
coffee' by a friend. When they
were on the walkway, near to the
JCR, the first year collapsed, and
his friend went to find help. One

Eric Allsop is New Council Chair
Summer fears that the main
decision making body of I C U
would start the new year without
a chairman were allayed on
Tuesday when Eric Allsop was
overwhelmingly voted in as
council chair. Much of the first
meeting was spent in heated
discussion of the proposed union
move to Sherfield. Page 2
