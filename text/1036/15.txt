This is the kind of film that comes with affirma-
tions like "powerful" and "moving" pasted on to
it. One man's story of the Spanish Civil War
comes complete with politics and a bit of
romance thrown in for good measure too. And
it's not a bad film either. The only problem is the
one that is director Ken Loach's trademark. He's
a political film-maker and despite the fact that
this film is ostensibly about the stifling of the
trade union and anarchistic militias by the com-
munists, he has to get contemporary as well.
The film starts with ambulance men run-
ning up a tower block staircase in Liverpool. The
camera ignores them, focussing instead on the
graffiti behind. The NF and BNP slogans are
stark; warning us that Loach is trying to make a
statement. And he certainly does. It's just a
shame that in order to do so the film has been to
given such a clumsy plot structure. To bring the
story 'up to date' Loach tells it as the grand-
daughter reads the letters that were sent back
home.
But back to the story. David (Ian Hart)
leaves England an unemployed communist
ready to fight fascism. In Spain he joins up with
a trade union militia, fights in couple of skir-
mishes and tries to lie back and forget Blighty.
And throughout it's the small-scaleness of the
action which is impressive. The sixteen strong
militia use ancient rifles, only throw the odd
grenade and survive on a diet
of bread and beans. Land and
Freedom is no Braveheart.
Yet their idyll is slowly
broken by the growing power
of international Stalinism. It
gets the militia new rifles but
with them also come uni-
forms, discipline and orders.
The dream is over and in the
climatic 'final battle scene' the
militia are forced to surrender
at gun point by their own side.
Back in the Nineties,
David is buried and his grand-
daughter gives the workers'
salute like it means something
now. So does Land and
Freedom end, as a good film
spoilt by good intentions.
• f i l m : species*
It takes about ten seconds of the opening credits
to realise that Species is going to be a distinctly
second rate Alien(s) rip-offi
The first clue is the way the title letters
come together in backlit luminous green and the
second is the way the name of "Giger - design-
er" leaps out of the screen. Not that many of the
audience will care in the least. The only thing
that the audience care about is the way a very
three dimensional Natasha Henstriage will leap
out of the screen. She, of course, is a megababe
and the only reasonforthe film's existence.
The plot is sketchy in the
extreme - all you'll want to know is
that Henstridge is an super
metabolised alien who has a burning
desire to reproduce (much to the
delight of the male population of LA
Jf- ' and the audience]. Unfortunately for
the 'hit' team sent to hunt her down,
her offspring will develop so quickly it
will be sexually mature in a matter of
days. An obvious problem if it turns
out to be male. Still, thankfully lor the
F audience, our alien is a gorgeous,
pouting, 'bonking and killing machine'
who takes her clothes off and kills
people with monotonous regularity.
And with equal monotony the
'hit' team follow a couple of steps behind, talk-
ing in hushed and stereotypical cliques.
So all in all Species is an appalling film with-
out any redeeming features. I'm sure that it will
do very well.
