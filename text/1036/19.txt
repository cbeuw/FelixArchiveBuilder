IQ
For students who are gay, lesbian or bisexual
this is an exciting time of change, chances
and opportunities.
But you have to be able to pluck up
courage and use those opportunities. If you
are a gay student in London you have a lot
going for you, but there are people who find
it hard to come to terms with their feelings,
and who worry about how the world will
view them. This is "coming out" and it takes
courage, strength and time.
So if you are gay or lesbian, and trying to
come out, then now that you have arrived
here, you have an opportunity to take full
advantage of all that the capital has to offer
to the gay man or lesbian. There are plenty
of people around who want to help you turn
your three years into a period of excitement
and discovery! Just take a walk around Soho
on a Saturday night for example, and you
will see hundreds of liberated, free people.
No-one pretends that there won't be
some people who aren't on our side, but you
shouldn't let them stop you from enjoying
yourself and meeting people.
What is important is that you take
control oi your own life and make your own
decisions. London Lesbian and Gay
Switchboard on 0171 837 7324 where they
have details of pubs, clubs and groups where
you can meet al kinds of gay people. Another
good contact is IQ - Imperial Queers - the
society for gay men, lesbians and bisexuals.
It meets every Tuesday at 7:30 in the Brown
Committee room, ICU.
Contact IQ at pink-help@doc.ic.ac.uk
or http://pink.doc.ic.ac.uk/IC/.
Spanish Society
'The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.'
Well, here in the Imperial College Spanish
Society we hispanophiles discuss many other
things: from where to get the cheapest
'chorizo' in London to the Spanish football
league - usually at our regular meetings but
really anywhere where a large enough group
of us gather. So if at all interested come
along and join in! Now, you might think,
"But I don't speak Spanish and I might feel a
bit out of place... well come to our first
Fiesta this year, on Saturday 21st, 8.30pm,
Ents lounge for £2.50. There will be lots of
Sangria. For more information, drop us a
note in our pigeon hole in the union or
contact Takeshi Martinez, physics UG 3
(std.martinez@ic.ac.uk)
Ents
Well, that's us just about recovered from the
excesses of Freshers Week, & here we are
ready to tell you all about the week ahead.
TONIGHT..
The first of our "BUST-A-GUT" Comedy
season, & we promise there'll be enough
chairs to go round this time. Kicking off this
year's season are John Fothergill, & the off
beat genius of Sean Lock, a cult comic in the
making. Due to problems with our sponsors
we can't offer the 1st 50 in a free bottle of
Newcastle Brown, but to make up for it they
can have a T-shirt instead, 'cos we love you
so much. Doors open at 8pm, & tickets are
£2.50 or £2 if with an Entscard.
Of course, if you just want to dance the night
away you can start your weekend with a
"Climax", with a bar 'til lam, & sounds 'til
2am. Free if you're here before 9pm, or if
you've got an Entscard.
SUN 15th - Spend the day chilling out.
DaVinci's opens at lpm & you can get a top
quality Sunday Dinner for £3. Then watch
Sheff. Weds, v Middlesboro' on the big
screen, & spend the evening enjoying the
Powder Keg Real Ale Festival.
M O N 16th - Live big screen football from
Standing Room Only, with Wimbledon v
West Ham.
TUES 17th - Use your brains to outwit our
resident quizmaster, Dan, & win yourself a
crate of beer in the process. Watch out for
the special prizes.
WEDS. 18th - Dance away the midweek
blues or celebrate your sporting successes
with "FROLIK"- a night of bouncy sounds for
party people. Best of all it's a bit of an OJ-
totally free but not entirely innocent.
THURS 19th - Get slinky & sophisticated at
the best value Cocktail Night in London, &
it's right on your doorstep. Watch out for
weekly specials, & if you just want to pose
there are non-alcoholic cocktails available.
FRI 20th - I'd try & get used to this - the
promised chart dance & handbag night has
been replaced with "Pop Tarts" - a night of
mainstream indie & student pop classics,
with a very special guest appearance from
one of London's top bands "MY LIFE
STORY". For those of you not au fait with
the Melody Maker faves, we're talking a 10
piece Britpop extravaganza, that are sex on a
stick live. Since they normally play to 600
people in London, this is a very special show,
& guaranteed to sell out at just £1 a ticket!
