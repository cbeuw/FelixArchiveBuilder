OSC also takes an active
part in all Union decisions, pro-
tects and promotes the interests
of international students in the
College and finances the run-
ning of all the individual nation-
al societies.
Naturally, all this takes a
lot of work, and many more
people than just the members
of the executive committee
take part voluntarily.
The executive committee
has one post empty from last
term's elections. There is also a
new post being created. So, the
two posts available to fill are:-
Honorary Junior Treasurer (to
work along side current treasur-
er) : financial control of the
OSC, budgeting of events, bud-
gets of the overseas societies,
adviser to the Chair. Honourary
Secretary : organises meetings,
is in charge of passing informa-
tion to and from the overseas
societies, event organising,
minute keeping and other
duties. Both of the above posts
require a fair amount of dedica-
tion. The duties are flexible and
all of the people in the execu-
tive committee share jobs and
cooperate.
The elections will be held
on Wednesday 18th October in
Mech Eng L.T. 220 at 13:00.
Anyone can stand, fresher to
postgraduate, as long as they
have a proposer and a seconder.
Each proposer will have the
right to speak for three minutes
and each candidate will be able
to give a give a short speech for
a maximum of five minutes.
Please turn up on the day and
have with you your swipe card
(or other form of college ID).
It is essential that every for-
eign student comes at least to
vote, because the wrong people
to take the decisions for you...
Gaurav Misra,OSC Chair

another Felix
hits the street...
Well, it's been enlightening,
my first freshers' week. Yes, I
know I was meant to go to it
when I started University, but
somehow it never really quite
happened. And by the time I had
been here a year I didn't have a
particularly large desire to
explore Imperial's Students
Union in all its glory. So it's been
a learning experience for me too,
listening to all the first years' dis-
cuss the new experience with
enthusiasm, while those later on
degrade it all with cynicism.
Sitting over a coffee in the
JCR, and one of them sums it all
up: "The union's crap". And no-
one has any doubt what he's try-
ing to say. It's not "I tried to get
some legal advice and found the
support unforthcoming." Nor is
it "I tried to hire out a minibus
and couldn't."
Imperial College Union is
judged on Wednesday and Friday
nights. And if you don't have a
riotous evening, then clearly
"The union is shite."
At first I thought it was the
people. Maybe no-one's getting
the stimulating conversation
they crave. And let's face it,
there are individuals at this col-
lege of ours that make Beavis and
Butthead look like epigrammatic
sophisticates. There are people
who would make you want to
sprint out and buy a gallon of
emulsion merely so you could
slap it on a wall and watch it dry
rather than engage in a millisec-
ond's conversation. But that's
not the real problem. Oh no.
To appreciate Imperial
College Union at it's finest you
have to be sitting in an office
round the back of the entertain-
ment's lounge editing news sto-
ries on a Wednesday night. And
while the heavily laden bass
makes the teaspoons rattle on
the sink you have to ask yourself
WHY they are playing the remix
of the Bee Gee's 'Staying Alive'
AGAIN. There must be a reason.
Surely. Why, every time, is it the
tackiest of dance music, with
'Parklife' as the penultimate
song?
I have yet to meet anyone
who does anything other than
pour scorn on the music they
play here, and that includes the
ents manager.
This does not seem to make
a great deal of sense.
