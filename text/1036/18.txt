EIGHTEEN. FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 1 3TH 1995 DIARY
S a i l i n g
The exams were finally over and the Sailing
Club were frantically trying to lose their
hangovers before going to the International
24hr Race in Coleraine, N. Ireland. The club
have participated in the oldest 24hr race,
since it's inception.
After the crossing we had time to see the
sights. First up was a visit to the Giants
Causeway followed by a visit to the Old
Bushmill Distillery. Tony had spent months
preparing for this moment by reading the
'Bluffers Guide to
Whiskey'. Paul used
an alternative meth-
od to become a ,
connoisseur by
sampling all the
whiskies, too many
times each!
About 24 hours
after leaving IC we
arrived at Coleraine
Yacht Club to be jKt
greeted by the I
e x c e e d i n g
hospitable members
who gave us food
and served us real
Guinness! Much drink flowed and James was
under great pressure to start the Karaoke off,
which he did after Chris and Ben, to form, by
all accounts, an appaling trio. James couldn't
focus on the words, Ben couldn't sing and
Chris turned the microphone off! We
finalised team names with the old boys
deciding on Team "Old Farts" but the young
upstarts were much more original with Team
"That's what my ex-girlfriend used to say."
The drinking continued well into the
night until the Commodore-elect, having
been voted in on the basis that he would be
very friendly to everyone, thought it would
be rude not to go to talk to a girl from
Bradford Uni. After making his move, 13
unsubtle comments were shouted across the
room as he was chatting to her, causing him
to make a sharp exit!
It was 12pm Saturday morning as the
Rude Boys crossed the start line in a
reasonable position for Team "Ex-Girlfriend"
only to ground on a sand bank shortly after.
They managed to extricate themselves from
this nasty situation only to find everyone else
on the horizon. Never mind 23 hours 50
minutes to go!
James and Sarah swapped with the Rude
Boys after a few hours. Sarah, never having
stepped in a dinghy before, soon worked out
what bit of string to pull and when to pull it
and all was going well until James capsized.
Sarah coped admirably well but the deck of
the boat was still an inch under the water
after righting. The next leg of the race was
spent bailing out as fast as possible to avoid
becoming a submarine!
The results were posted hourly and
Team "Ex-Girlfriend" were around 7th while
Team "Old Farts" were a place or two higher
as it got dark. The wind dropped as night fell
and then the 'Fireflies' came into their own,
sailing well up to their handicap. Those that
weren't sailing took advantage of the Barbie
and disco.
The night shift was a nightmare! Getting
woken up at 2am to be told that you have to
vacate your lovely warm sleeping bag for the
cold water was tough. However, James and
Tony took some beers with them and jumped
into the Team "Ex-Girlfriend" boat.
Martin, Alan and Paul all put in sterling
performances for the same team with no big
upsets. The final shift was sailed by Chris and
James and they were
! the second boat over
I the line, finishing to
a standing ovation.
After the handicap
adjustment, Team
" Ex- G ir 1 f rie nd "
ended the race in a
respectable 6th
place. Ben collected
a decent trophy for
Team "Old Farts".
Team "Ex-Girl-
friend" got nice
pens as consolation
prizes.
Ben Chromedome
and some fellow Team "Ex-Girlfriend"
members went for a breath of fresh air on
deck on the ferry and they were rewarded
with the sight of a seagull dumping right on
Ben's advancing forehead. Laugh? We nearly
cried!
The cost of all this fun? A tenner. You
want to come next year, you fancy learning to
sail or just want to take a boat out? Find us in
Southside Upper Lounge every Tuesday
lunchtime or e-mail: sailing@ic.ac.uk! (You
could be just in time for a quality bar and
disco night!)
