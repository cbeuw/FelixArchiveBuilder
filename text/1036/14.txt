gig:levellers + prophets of
da city - brbrtoru
singles:,!
I suppose you could say that Prophets of Da
City are important. Important because they look
like being the first ghetto-grown South African
act to make an impact outside their troubled but
ever progressing homeland. And yet, live at least,
their music comes across as startlingly unimpor-
tant. The traditional African influences are lost
amidst the standard hip-hop beats and over the
top rapping, while two mid-stage breakdancers
serve to accentuate the frailties of the live perfor-
mance rather than adding an interesting visual
dimension. Still, it's pretty impressive that they
manage to get half of the white, middle class
teenage crowd shouting, "Ho!", even if the reali-
ty of it is total absurdity. And as for the retarded
speech about the Criminal Justice Bill and how
"every government in the world is trying to f***
with people"- well, I guess that explains what
they were doing supporting The Levellers.
Ah yes, The Levellers. Let it be said that I
have never liked those veteran crusties.
Okay, I'll be the first to admit that they put
on a good show. They perform newies from
'Zeitgeist', oldies from A Weapon called the
word', and middle-aged ones from 'Levellin' the
Land' and 'The Levellers' with zest and an inspir-
ing passion. No, to me their problem lies in their
stubborn adherence to their pseudo-revolution-
ary ideals. Their new T-sliirts talk about anarchy
and how "anyone who lays their hand upon me
to govern me is a monster, a tyrant, and I declare
them my enemy", or something. Their songs talk
about non-conformity to the police, to society, to
anyone but yourself. And yet this show embodies
all the best points of a stadium rock show. There
are thousands of people singing and moving to the
same songs, expertly co-ordinated lights that
complement the music, and changes in stage
backdrop. Fine, but don't pretend that this is any-
thing different. The Levellers are making pots of
cash singing,"There's only one way of life, and
that's your own, that's your own." Tell that to the
4000 'individuals' who were all singing it in uni-
son and choke on the irony.
