TWENTY-TWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 1 3TH 1 995 LETTERS
L E T T E R S T O F E L I X : R E P L I E D T O T H I S W E E K BY J E R E M Y
Irrational F E L I X or Barmy Bayley?
Dear Editor,
We are writing to express
fear over the apparent direction
that journalism at Felix seems to
be taking. We refer to your
response to a letter in Felix 1035.
Whilst we do not subscribe to the
views of ConSoc, Ian Bayley
appears to be terrifyingly correct
in saying "Felix is no place for
rationally discussing issues of the
day - Hence the need for our
society." The concern is that
Imperial could be losing its only
source of impartial information
into the abyss of sensationalist,
politically biased journalism.
Your reply of "What gave you the
idea that Felix is politically neu-
tral" implies that it no longer is.
Is this your view alone or the
view of Felix generally? Felix is
the most widely read and the
only serious, impartial source of
news in College. This impartiality
now appear under threat. As
there is no alternative to Felix it
should be impartial. To reject
Felix is to starve oneself of col-
lege news.
Undoubtedly, views should
be expressed, but its place should
be in editorial and opinion
columns. Our chief worry is news
reporting will be affected by
what appears to be Felix's new
policy.
Please do not turn the news
pages of Felix into an arena for
political mudslingmg.
Yours sincerely,
Sam Asfaw, Chem II
James Fox, CivEng II
Alan Mole, Aero II
Faisal Nazir, Physics II
Please be. assured that our
news pages will remain as high
quality as we can manage, and
free from spin. This is how it
works - we are funded by the
Union, but we arc free to say
what we want, hence the 'Keep
Felix Free' business. Our prima-
ry objective is to consider the
majority of the students - but
not necessarily by agreeing with
them. But I am worried that
your idea of impartiality seems
to suggest we shrink from
addressing highly important
issues, even if people write to us
about them. The editor's replies
to letters are an opinion section.
Oh, and there's always the I C
Reporter.
Dear Rachel
Having read last week's Felix
(from cover to cover obviously!) I
came across the somewhat petu-
lant letter by the ever reactionary
Ian Bayley. His lecture of misin-
formed nonsense could not, I
felt, be allowed to stand without
a full questioning of the author's
own version of logic.
The initial reaction on read-
ing his letter is that a small article
in the 'news in brief column
could not quite be described as a
'voracious campaign' or 'hysteria'
as Mr Bayley so delicately puts it.
Some might suggest that it could
be the ConSoc chair who is trying
to hype the issue in an attempt to
gain publicity with a new band of
freshers - but then I couldn't pos-
sibly suggest that he would be so
mercenary.
As far as I can remember
from the original small article,
your newspaper was not even
suggesting that Mr Murdoch
should be defended, merely
pointing out that ICU could be
laying themselves open to legal
action by allowing such articles to
appear in their web pages.
Whatever Mr Bayley may say, the
Web pages still come under the
Union's control and as far as I am
aware , he has not yet been
declared an expert on the legali-
ties of the Web page liability.
I do hope that although you
state that, while taking a line on
certain issues, i.e. not being com-
pletely politically 'neutral', your
will remain
a place for
rationally and impartially dis-
cussing the 'issues of the day'.
The thought that ConSoc, with
all its inherent prejudices and
party dogma, could be a refuge
for such discussion is frightening.
It is with some trepidation
that I find myself agreeing with
Mr Bayley on the fact that Mr
Murdoch does wield enormous
unchallenged power. I would
question the background to his
fear - perhaps the fact that Mr
Murdoch's titles seem to be eas-
ing themselves towards support-
ing the Labour Party might have
more to do with his views, than
any antipathy to the idea of the
abuse of power without the nec-
essary scrutiny.
Finally, could I point out
that rather than hindering
ConSoc, your reporter's article
and the fact that you were pre-
pared to print their reply, have
done little damage to the society
- as few other groups have been
the topic of conversation within
one week of the start of term.
Name retained.
Exactly.
Food Fight?
Dear Sir/Madam
The rank and file staff in the
Catering department are out-
raged at the insulting comments
made by John Foster, Catering
Manager.
Who exactly are the staff
who "currently enjoy high wages
and long holidays"? It is a fact
that those employed in the cater-
ing industry are poorly paid.
If the sickness rate among
staff is high, surely he needs to
address this issue, and perhaps
improve working conditions.
There is no doubt that such crass
comments do little to improve
morale.
Take heed, Mr Foster. A bad
workman always blames his tools.
Yours faithfully,
The overpaid &i constantly
holidaying catering staff.
I've been on caterers' wages
myself: they were the lowest.
There must be something
awry with the management if
they can make such hopeless
losses even with underpaid staff
and a captive market.
To a l l I C
International
Students
Now that you've all more or
less settled down, it's time to get
you informed about what the
OSC is and what it does to keep
you happy. OSC or "Overseas
Students Committee" deals with
all the international students of
Imperial College (EC and
Occasional students included).
The OSC is a Major
Subcommittee of Imperial
College Union and deals with the
37% of the student population
that is of non-British origin.
Imperial College is one of the
most multicultural academic
institutions in the world . OSC is
the umbrella committee for the
foreign student societies, which
currently number 24. The OSC
organises events such as food
fairs, International week, discos
and inter-society sporting events.
It also organises international
night. This is the largest event of
Imperial College that occurs in
the second term and attracts
more than a thousand spectators
every year. It includes cultural
shows and displays of various
countries, food fairs, disco, live
bands and more fun than you
could possibly imagine.
