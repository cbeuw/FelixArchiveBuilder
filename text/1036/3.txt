Controversy still surrounds
the proposed extension of
Imperial College rowing club's
boat house.
The club hopes to receive
planning permission for the £1
million project in November, but
after five years of planning and
nine months of consultation,
local residents are still unhappy
with the scheme.
Sports and Leisure Manager
Frank Murray insists that the
extension is a vital upgrade of
facilities that have remained
more or less unchanged for the
last sixty years. When it was built
in 1937, the designers did not see
the need to include women's
shower rooms, or indoor training
facilities.

Accommodation fears
Fears have been expressed
that Imperial College students
are increasing becoming victims
of unscrupulous letting agents,
who illegally charge for 'hidden'
costs when letting flats and
houses. Students, often in a rush
to secure a place to live before
term starts, are being forced to
pay for charges such as 'holding
deposits' and 'handling fees'.
One group of students put
down a deposit of £350 on a
house in Willisden, expecting to
move in from the end of
September. However, on
arriving, they discovered that the
present tenants would not be
moving out until November,
leaving them without
accommodation lor the new
term. The agent, Kevin Begoo,
disappeared leaving no contact
address, and without one the
students cannot take out a court
order to retrieve their money.
They are anxious to trace him
However, neighbours of the
Putney Embankment site claim
that the expansion will destroy
the character of the local area.
"College is bending over
backwards to accommodate local
residents wishes," M r Murray
said. He claimed that
consulations with those affected
have resulted in 6 - 7 changes
and modifications to the plans.
Bill Mason, Boat Club Coach
says that they have a water tight
case for the spend. Imperial
College rowers have won just
about every major competition in
the last few years.
Tim Townend, Deputy
President (C&S) was unsym-
pathetic to the locals' comp-
laints: "If they live on a river,
what do they expect," he said.
and ask anyone with information
of his whereabouts to contact
k.m.jones@ic.ac.uk.
Pat Harvey, Residents'
Assistant at the Student
Accommodation Office (SAO)
told Felix that although deposits
are sometimes difficult to
reclaim, the specific problems of
the students mentioned had not
occurred before. Answering the
charge that the SAO is meant to
vet agents, she said that the it has
insufficient funds and staff to
actively assess the names it
provides, so no guarantee of
suitability can be given.
Nevertheless, the Office and the
Union advisor will act upon
complaints made against any of
the names on the lists.
The Union Advisor, Minever
Kavlak, suggests that although
many agents are "charging fees
for 'holding deposits',
'administrative fees' and
'inventory fees'", students should
be prepared to challenge such
fees. She recommends that if the
amounts charged seem excessive,
then they should be reported to
the local Trading Standards
Officer. She also advises that a
complete inventory should be
carried out with a witness, and
this inventory be given to the
agent or landlord. "Holding
deposits are not good practice
and should be challenged" she
says, "nor can agents charge for
your details."
Further advice is available
from the Housing Rights Guide
which can be obtained from the
Union or the S A O .
Beit Manoeuvres
Ian Caldwell and Ian Frame
of the Estates Division have
called for better communication
with Imperial College Union
(ICU) over the proposed move of
the union offices. The four I C U
sabbatical officers met the estates
directors on Monday after a
letter from the I C U executive to
the department and articles in
Felix emphasised the concerns of
the student body.
In an amicable yet frank
meeting, M r Caldwell
emphasised that Estates had the
union's best interests at heart.
Tim Townend, Deputy
President, expressed concern
that alternative proposals to
expand the student facilities in
their current Beit Quad location
had not been considered.
On Tuesday night the
Student Council voted to back a
request to the College from the
executive . This requests funds to
help study the viability of ICU's
plans for Beit. Sarah White, I C U
President explained the plans to
move the Union offices and Felix
to the front of Beit Quad, with
the Bar and the Lounge enlarging
into the freed-up space on the
ground floor. The rest of Beit
could then be developed for
conferences, and the extra
students could be
accommodated.
Sarah reiterated her
scepticism of the propsed plans
to move. It would be "...like a
sports centre in the middle of
Sherfield" and at odds with
student's interests, she said. Dr.
Eastwood, Director of Planning,
put it that the feasibility
studyhad managed to make an
amalgamation of the Union and a
cut down administration
workable in the building.
The plans stem from an idea
suggested by architects Sir
Norman Foster and Partners that
the college lacked 'a heart', and
