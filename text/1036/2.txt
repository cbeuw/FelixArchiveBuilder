Hizb-ut-Tahrir
Strike Again
BY A N D Y SINHARAY
An extremist Islamic group
who were caught illegally
exhibiting at Freshers' Fair last
week appears to have struck
again.
It is believed that Hizb-ut-
Tahrir, a group entirely separate
from IC's own Islamic Society,
have been attempting to
distribute unsolicited leaflets
through departmental pigeon
holes as well as putting leaflets
under students' doors in Prince's
Gardens. Reports have reached
Felix of literature being placed in
the departments of Physics and
Aeronautics, issued by what calls
itself the "Hizb-ut-Tahrir
Cultural Commitee", although it
is unclear whether or not IC
students are responsible.
One orthdox Muslim
student who did not wish to be
identified, seemed to have taken
the law into his own hands and
disposed of some of the
literature himself having seen it
in his department. He said that
the majority of Muslims distance
themselves from Hizb-ut-Tahrir
"and it's quite common to see
people go up to them... and ask
what they're doing and why."
However, he seemed
surprised at the apparent
tameness of the literature itself;
"They've never been that quiet
before... they've been quite open
about what they do." Set up in
the 1950s the group, which
claims to have been continually
misrepresented, has been widely
accused of being anti-semitic,
sexist and homophobic.
The student went on to
theorise that some young male
Muslims were drawn to the
group not so much due to its
ideology as its notoriety.
Other students reported the
unsolicited delivery of leaflets at
Falmouth-Keogh Hall, though
none of the staff nor security
personnel appeared to be aware
of their distribution. The
Warden of the Hall, Professor
Geoffrey New, said, "It's very
difficult to control. If it's a
student I'm not really sure what
we could do to stop it."
Though it has come to light
that more othodox Muslims have
had leaflet campaigns in the
Prince's Gardens area, Hizb-ut-
Tahrir have been similarly
distributing material. Felix did
attempt to contact Hizb-ut-
Tahrir on the contact telephone
number that had been given on
the leaflet. The number itself
turned out to be a switchboard
extension of a company which
had said it didn't have knowledge
of any religious groups.
Hizb-ut-Tahrir were
particularly active last academic
year when their behaviour was
condemned by London Colleges
including KCL, SOAS, and the
University of London Union
itself, which consequently
banned them from its premises.
On Wednesday Brunei
University shut down its own
union's Islamic Society as it had
been so overrun with Hizb-ut-
Tahrir members.

The vacant position of
Imperial College Union Council
Chair was filled by a Mechanical
Engineering Postgraduate, Eric
Allsop, in a two man contest on
Tuesday night. The post had
become vacant because the
intended incumbent, Vinod
Fernandez, is no longer at
Imperial. The first meeting of
the year had to fill a number of
vacant posts, including that of
Women's Officer.
After considerable diff-
iculties were experienced in the
election of the four Ordinary
Members, the bulk of the
meeting was taken up with talk
of the proposed Union move to
Sherfield. The mood of Council
was clearly hostile to any
relocation away from Beit Quad,
with many questioning the
practicality of cohabitation with
the administration.
Following protracted, and
often heated discussion, Council
unanimously agreed to back
ICU's approach of arguing for
the best facilities in a possible
Shcrfield-based Union, while
campaigning for the extension
of the existing base in Beit
Quad.

raggie said that 'He didn't seem
any worse than many other
people get throughout the year.'
A spokesman for Rag said
that Mr Willis had been very
careful about obtaining
permission for the event,
especially with regard to the
funds for the drinks. He had
raised the matter at a Union
Finance Committee, and
received assurances there, and
later from Matt Crompton, Dep.
Pres. Finance and Services, that
the idea was acceptable
'assuming that he was aware of
the licensing rules'. When Mr
Willis inquired at the bar in order
to get the spirits, he was told to
get them from an off-license.
Responsibility for the
incident is confused, with a letter
from Security seemingly
absolving Richard Willis from
blame, saying that 'every effort
was made to ensure that new
students were not encouraged to
over-indulge,' and that his actions
following the event were 'highly
commendable'. However, Matt
Crompton stated in a
memorandum that he held it to
be, 'the responsibility of the
society concerned to control the
quantity and ensure that people
do not have too much to drink...I
think that it is the- responsibility
of Rag to ensure that they didn't
drink to excess.'
