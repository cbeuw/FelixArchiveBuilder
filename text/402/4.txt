4 FELIX
Refectory S e n s a t i o n a l i s m . ...or not ?
battle continues
Sir, - Since Mr W i l l i a m s ' s
article was mainly directed
at what he felt was my
" a m b i t i o u s r e p u d i a t i o n " of
his refectory c r i s i s s y n o p s i s ,
I feel I should have one last
stab at correcting matters.
The heading " P o o h ' s
c o r n e r " was very apt: it was
full of typical Pooh logic
(eg P l e a s e knock if an
answer i s not required!)
together w i t h several
misconceptions.
He a s k s : " D i d
offer to campaign
refectories if the
kept the prices
my ears

Mr
to
Were

Body
give

Teague
fill the

d o w n ? "
deceiving me
on Governing
and heard Mr Teague
this very last ditch
last summer? I notice
Mr Williams did not argue
with my mathematics or the
inevitable conclusion of
the Governing body that I
expressed last time.
I do not accept h i s views
on the relation between union
and college, but there's not
enough room to d i s c u s s
that here.
The good side of this
d i s c u s s i o n has certainly
been that everyone now is
aware of the issues at stake.
The editor in last week's
editorial suggests that the
Union should take over the
catering service. " S e n n e t "
tells us how successful
Q E C were in a temporary
venture of this type —however,
most unions that have
attempted to run the catering
(eg Surrey University) have
(at least financially) deeply
regretted it. S t i l l , I hope
this suggestion w i l l be
treated seriously despite
my belief that it is not our
job to run such s e r v i c e s .
A l s o I've just heard that
Mr Mooney has invited Messrs
Teague, Williams and myself
to see certain aspects of
meal preparation — s o perhaps
w e ' l l have more to say later.
Now, come on someone,
let's hear your views on
accommodation problems or
something — perhaps they
may prove less difficult
after d i s c u s s i o n .
Yours faithfully,
WA G E R R A R D .

Sir, — The headlines of the
past two editions of F E L I X
have been presented some-
what disturbingly. It seems
that after so many years
of trying to emulate "The
Sun', F E L I X has finally
found Suitable Sensational
N e w s to make t h e s e
f r o n t - p a g e s p l a s h e s .
The headlines published
were indelicate, i n s e n s i t i v e
and crude. We believe that
it i s unsuitable for a student
newspaper to broadcast
personal tragedies in such
a way. In a small community
such a s IC, a newspaper
should be able to serve a
more useful purpose than
the initiation of gossip.
If it is necessary to publish
such news, it should be
presented in a more considerate
fashion. It appears that the
circulation of F E L I X is
more important than the
feelings of those involved.
Yours sincerely,
G K N I E U W E N H U I J S

(Whilst I applaud your
sense of morale justice, I
teel that on this occassion
you are being misled by it.
I would contend the use of the
adjectives "indelicate",
"insensitive" and "crude"
with regard to the two stories
you refer to.
On the contrary, they
were tactual and to the point
and in the first instance,
helped to destroy any
unfounded rumours being
spread at the time. I would
draw your attention to the
fact that, in the second
story concerning a girl being
raped, the so-called sun —
type sensational story was
in essence an announcement
appealling for witnesses
who may yet be crucial in
helping to solve the case.
The circulation of FELIX,
though a factor in determining
the content of the paper to an
extent, is not more important
than peoples' leelings.
I thank you for your
missive and suggest that in
future you read our
'sensational' front page
stories a little more carefully
betore giving air to your
critical talents — Ed.).
Sir, — May I congratulate
you on the considerate way
you have dealt with two
rather sensitive stories in
the last two issues of
F E L I X . I refer of course to
to the resident dying in
Linstead Hall and the sad
c a s e of a girl being raped
at IC.
Many editors would be
tempted to delve deep into
the background of these
stories, p r e s e n t i n g a
sensationalist, crude and
hurtful imitation of the
Sun, News of the World e t c .
Instead you have presented
the plain facts and nothing
more. Y o u even had the
courtesy not to mention the
names of those involved.
Yours sincerely,
C L I V E D E W E Y .

" O n c e more Into the breach, dear friends, once m o r e ! " was
the war cry heard at 8am last Saturday outside 14, Cromwell
P l a c e (IF Headquarters). No, It wasn't the storming of the
B a s t i l l e — just a band of heroic volunteers who braved the
elements and ventured out into the morning mists to lend very
welcome hands for the decorating of the IF float.
Everybody seemed to be
to
in a state of total c o l l a p s e
(must be these all-night
do's!) but rallied round
magnificiently, e s p e c i a l l y
when we discovered at 9.30am
that the float's theme model
was stuck somewhere in
Bayswater! Three intrepid
girls set off in search of it,
arriving back at IF just in
time to be hoisted up onto
the 40 foot lowry. Arriving at
the back of IC, we were
joined by several members of
the jazz club, who played
gallantly throughout the
proceedings. We were then
steered quickly towards the
other floats and the M i c h e l i n
bus parked on Imperial
Institute Road, and off we
went towards High St K e n .
and many shocked onlookers —
mind you, I don't suppose
you do see M i c h e l i n buses
and floats every day of the
week!
Despite the weather, the
shoppers were out and about
and few escaped the money-
grabbing collections from
IC and IF — well done lads
and l a s s e s ! Thanks should
also go to the police contingent,
most of whom bought Rag
Mags and took that opportunity
to chat up the girls on the
float (they know quality when
they see it!)
Everyone who took part
in the procession enjoyed
themselves, and the enthusiasm,
bubbling everywhere, was
tremendous and s t i l l apparent
at about 1pm when policemen,
drivers,floaters,and collectors
— a l l tired, hoarse, cold and
hungry (but s t i l l smiling) —
arrived back on familiar
ground and proceeded to take
over the Union bar. B o b , our
driver, became so attached to
the bar and h i s fourth pint
of bitter in fact, that Carole
had to forcibly pour the
liquid down h i s throat so
that he would return our
motley band and her goods
back to I F . A n d what a sight
that w a s ! Four of u s , with
10feet each of space, clinging
hold of chains, tables, empty
wine bottles etc for dear
life as we were driven
(rather haphazardly) along
Queensgate towards I F . It was
definitely a memorable ride!
Clearing up proved an easy
task, due to a kind band of
helpers, and 3pm saw us on
our way home, where the
sound of heavy sleepers
was a l l that broke the s i l e n c e
— and a l l I can say to those
who actually made it to
SS, E v e l y n Gardens is you
must be superhuman or b....
raving! Hope you had fun,
though! A n d to those who are
suffering from the aftermath
of the wind and rain — fear
not, you are in good company -
atishoo!
