"Secret G o v e r n m e n t plans for
more education c u t s ' - N U S
allegation
The Government was
accused this week of planning
secretly to force l o c a l
authorities to make staff
redundent and to make further
cuts i n higher education of
over £130 m i l l i o n .
N U S President Charles
C l a r k e said he wanted the
government to answer two
specific charges: " F i r s t l y ,
that the Rate Support Grant
for next year, which i s due
to be announced today, w i l l
be so low as to drive some
local authorities into bank-
ruptcy, or enforce massive
redundancies. I don't know
if Mr Mulley and the other
s o c i a l services ministers
are putting up any kind of
fight against the Treasury
and Mr C r o s l a n d ; but unless
these cuts are stopped, they
w i l l he presiding over the
destruction of education
and s o c i a l services as we
know them.
" S e c o n d l y , that plans for
massive spending cuts have
been drawn up and top
C i v i l Servants are working
on ways to carve over £130
million from higher education
alone in the course of one
year. That would mean the
closure of many more c o l l e g e s
and their departments, the
redundancy of thousands
of staff in a l l jobs within
the higher education sector.
Undoubtedly, the already
weakening condition of
student support would receive
yet one more body blow.*'
The secrecy surrounding
these proposals reminded Mr
Clarke of " T h e hatchet job
which destroyed the C o l l e g e s
of E d u c a t i o n " . He demanded
an end of secrecy. " L a s t
week the International
Monetary Fund lent £975
million to the B r i t i s h Govern-
ment. What kind of guarantees
were given in r e t u r n ? "
Mr Clarke added:
" I t may be that some
form of short-term relief
w i l l arise to stop the worst
effects. W h a t e v e r the
situation the public has a
right to know what i s going
on.
" I challenge Mr Mulley
to deny absolutely that the
new Rate Support Grant w i l l
force even more swinging
cutbacks. Will he give a
categorical assurance that
there w i l l be no more
cuts i n educational expenditure
for next year or subsequent
ones?
" I f these measures do
go forward, l o c a l c o u n c i l l o r s
must refuse to implement
them; staff must not be
laid off; courses must not
be c l o s e d ; students' grants
must continue to be p a i d .
If that means that the council
must look for support from
the people who elected them
in pursuing a c o l l i s i o n course
with the government, then I
am convinced that they w i l l
get it. Certainly those of us
in student unions w i l l do
whatever we c a n . "

Mr K e i t h Ahlers has
resigned as President of the
C i t y and G u i l d s U n i o n . Mr
A h l e r s , who has only been
in office for nine weeks,
resigned last Wednesday. In
his presidential column in

yesterday, he says " A c a d e m i c
reasons have left me no
option but to resign as
President of C i t y and G u i l d s
Union for the s e s s i o n 1975/
76. Naturally this i s a great
wrench for m e . . . "
The G u i l d s executive met
last night to d i s c u s s the
situation.
Many people in the Union
(both I C U and C & G U ) have
expressed their regret at
his departure.

I thought we'd start off by taking a look at presidential
b i c y c l e s . After a l l Steve Brightman was mandated to ride one down
to Putney on Morphy Day, wasn't he? Never-mind Rag Week
went off very well with all the
Michel in Bus for the procession,
to remember seeing Mr Brightman
presidents gathering on the
All the presidents; I seem
and the lipsmacking thirst-
quenching J a c k i e Parrot waving to the procession as it passed
the Albert H a l l — for the second time! He made up for it
later by getting on the Mines float.
Well, you've got to hand it to him, he was at least considerate
enough to let Dave Dodge get a decent night's sleep Pity I
can't get to the next R C S Union Meeting (I'd get lynched); I'll
just have to put up with the more familiar sourroundings of M E 220.
Talking of swimming A l f ' s Imperial Army went in well at
Putney! Astonished to witness a feeble attempt to get Dave
Lord to fol low.
I suppose I shouldn't ask what stopped Keith Ahlers making
the Rag Procession. (If you're an avid F E L I X reader y o u ' l l
spot the answer elsewhere in this issue).
What happened to Stella Godfrey last Saturday morning — now
there's a thought N i c k Brayshaw seemed to have an excellent
Rag Week — bit cheeky, but a great way to raise £200. How about
having it as an annual event-instead of the pillory of the exec.
You can just see the ICU E x e c (plus the ICWA President?)
streaking around R A H . £1000 in 10 minutes By the way what
happened to N i c k Roe's R C S U jacket?

E n g l a n d soccer star
P a u l Madeley, the England
soccer star, sustained a knee
injury on Monday whilst
training with the rest of the
England squad at Harlington,
the Imperial College sports
ground near London Airport.
The squad was having a
work-out just prior to their
departure to L i s b o n > for the
European C h a m p i o n s h i p
match against Portugal.
Madeley, a man who
normally stands up to the
toughest treatment, s a i d " I
felt something go i n my k n e e "
and retired for treatment.
It was Peter Mee, the
College Registrar and
President of the IC F o o t b a l l
C l u b , who offered Harlington's
f a c i l i t i e s to the squad since
their pre-departure hotel
overlooked the ground. Don
Revie, the England team
manager, was said to have
been delighted to receive the
invitation.
