Smoking Concert
P. Dean
A s expected the RCS Smoking concert was a great
success.' Several hundred people packed the Union
concert hall to view the annual Sex, Filth & Depravity
show.'
Chalky White opened the
proceedings by introducing
Chem I and their Teddy
B e a r s ' orgy. In t h i s , several
members of the department
muddled their way through a
sketch singing Python-like
songs and o c c a s i o n a l l y
rolling on the floor stroking
each other.
After suffering Chalky
White's jokes for a couple of
minutes, we were introduced
to R C S executive and their
B i g Bang Theory. N i c Roe,
a professor involved i n the
study of sex, explained in
his broken German the
research being carried out
on this subject. In an
e x p l i c i t dialogue, illustrated
with equations and u t i l i s i n g
dimensional a n a l y s i s , he
proved that sex leads to
babies. Quite a revelation!
Other members of R C S
executive then went on to
describe their involvement
with sex. The sketch went
down w e l l , even with the
Guildsmen, who proved that
their paper darts could be
aimed very accurately, much
to the embarrasment of M i s s
H i t c h C o c k .
P h y s i c s I performed next.
Two little schoolboys
innocently playing marbles
were confronted by a mysterious
figure who unashamedly
unfastened h i s coat, sending
them away terrified. Then
a young tart parading around
the stage was also confronted
by this mystery man. After
exposing himself once
again, the girl ran away
screaming. What could
p o s s i b l y be so horrible? ...

Recovering f r o m Simon
C h a s e ' s masterpiece, we
were confronted by Maths I.
In an amalgam of old Monty
Python material they tried
to disgust the audience,
drinking p i s s and phlegm
out of buckets. L a t e r we
were introduced to a dog
which bore a strange resem-
blance to a bog brush and
had a l i k i n g for bar-maids.
After refusing to 'mount'
on two o c c a s i o n s h i s owner
was forced to demonstrate,
amid much noisy encouragement
from the audience. But as
l i v e sex i s not allowed
at R C S Smoking Concerts,
the curtain came down.
The d r a g a r t i s t s ,
" P l a y g i r l s " , were next on
the b i l l . They pranced around
the stage miming to various
female recordings (Boring).
T h i s went on for much too
long and eventually they
resorted to embarrasing
those members of the audience
sitting c l o s e to the stage.
They finished off their act
in a much better fashion,
proving they were quite hot
stuff.
After a break for liquid
refreshment, K a n g a l a s ,
Boomalakas and various
other tribal songs 2001: A
Space Obscenity. T h i s was
an incredibly long rendition
by Chemistry 7(?), but they
managed to keep the audience
amused for most of the time
although the puns became
rather painful at times. The
act provoked much audience
participation. At one stage
B U M (their B r i t i s h made
computer) gave the results
of the 3rd test as " E n g l a n d
won by an innings and 168
runs. "Highly improbable','
replied Mr P o c k s . "Bloody
inconceivable" someone
shouted. And so it went-on
and on and on and on ....
After more Kangalas etc.
it was the turn of the I C U
executive to show us how
to be very s i l l y . John Downs
arrived complete with baby
i n pram. "When's the next
train North?", he a s k e d .
The question passed slowly
down the executive line
from K e i t h (beautiful legs)
A h l e r s to R i z Shakir (giving
a good impression of an
Indian) to Steve Brightman to
N i c ("take off your t r o u s e r s " )
Brayshaw and finally to the
only Irish station master
with a Brummie accent,
P e t e Teague himself. While
this was going on, John
was giving his Mines baby
a bottle (light ale) which
was a pleasant distraction
from the monotony of the
original plot.
Next came N i c k Wilkinson
with his 'Do-it-yourself,
Do-it-yourself m a c h i n e .
After that came G u i l d s ,
' B o r i n g ' they shouted, and
it was, too boring to write
about. Next came the climax,
so we were led to b e l i e v e ,
of the evening, the Stripped
T h i s was a disappointment
(no seduction of audience
members etc.) a mere go-go
dancer. 'We want Brayshaw'
they shouted, and so it ended.
