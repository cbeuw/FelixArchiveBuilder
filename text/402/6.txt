6 FELIX
G L I D I N G C L U B
by PJ Verkroost
The G l i d i n g C l u b finished
last year by rising to great
heights (sic) at Aboyne,
Scotland, during the last two
weeks of the summer vacation.
If that ortnight was described
as s u c c e s s f u l , you run out
of adjectives for the second
half of the expedition.
There were only five of us
for the second half — three
ex-students and two between
the status of student and
ex-student. Between us, we
managed to achieve two
diamond heights and two
gold heights. The only
person who did not manage
anything was Jeff who had
already achieved his gold
h e i g h t on a previous
expedition.
Ian Parker did however,
reach a height of 25,OCX)
feet above the site w h i l e
yours truly reached 21,000
feet in the C l u b Dart at the
same time and roughly the
same place. I broke off my
climb w h i l e s t i l l going up at
400 feet per minute due to
the fact that my feet were
freezing and I was not too
sure of where I was. A l s o , I
was about to hit high level
cloud and in addition could
not see where I was going
because the canopy had
almost completely iced up.
In the event, the descent was
straight-forward until the
last 1000 feet when turbulence
set in — they stopped launching
when they saw my landing!!
We had two or three more
good days in which period
Paul and Steve attained
their gold heights. P a u l ,
on one s u s p i c i o u s day,
flew straight over Aboyne
airfield without seeing it.
By the time he had re-
orientated himself and turned
round, he was too far away to
get beck and landed in a field
two miles away. The other
field landing w a s made by
Steve who was practicing
cloud flying — in a strong
wind? He landed fifteen
miles down w i n d .
T h i s year has begun well
for the C l u b , this being
e s s e n t i a l l y due to keen
freshers. Despite the general
bad weather at the weekends,
four or five students have
progressed from the motor
glider onto the engineless
type. Several others are not
far behind.
For those students to
whom c i r c u i t bashing in
lousy weather is not the done
thing there has been plenty
to do around L a s h a m . The
dart trailer is in the process
of having its front end
rebuilt (yet again!) after
an accident on the way up
to Scotland. We are a l s o
starting to do the C of A ' s
on our various gliders.
If anyone is interested
in joining the C l u b , but has
not so far been in touch with
us, please come along to
one of our meetings. We
meet every Thursday at
5.30pm in Aero 254 when
we have films or lectures
and arrange transport down
to Lasham for the next
weekend. There are always
cars go'ng down which are
available for l i f t s . If you
are not sure about gliding
but would like to find out
more about it we can arrange
for you to go down for a
weekend to Lasham as a
guest (only s o c i a l member-
ship fee payable — 50p)
and have a flight or two to
see how your fair. F l y i n g
membership for a year is
£9.50.
The bonfire party at
Lasham last weekend went
off with a roar, several
bangs and the odd f i z z .
Those of us who could
remember it, decided that
it was one of the best
parties Lasham had produced.
The next s o c i a l function
is the farmers' cheese and
wine party to which a l l
farmers who have been landed
on are invited. I need to go
to that if only to see if any
of my five turn up! * After
that it w i l l be the Christmas
dinner.

S O C
So far this term we have
had two major events. The
first of these was the
Freshers Reception in which
new members of the C o l l e g e
were introduced to the
Society and were able to
meet each other and continuing
members. For a few who had
only recently come to Britain,
it a l s o served as a stepping
stone into B r i t i s h Society.
It was conducted informally
over drinks and s n a c k s , and
afterwards we featured
" E v e r l a s t i n g G l o r y " , a film
which depicted a s u c c e s s f u l
general during the time of the
Japanese wars who suffered
as a family man in having
to obey orders and serve
his country in its best
interests.
The second event was
the football match played
last Sunday against the
India Society. About 18 of
us truned up in varying
degrees of unfitness to
face 9 Indians. It was an
11-a-side match played on
Harlington's worst pitch, and
despite being able to make
numerous substitutions we
found ourselves a goal
down after only a minute.
Although we managed to
decelerate their scoring
rate as the match wore on,
we found ourselves 5 — 0
down at half-time. Afraid
of waht we might do with
the breeze behind us in the
second half, the opposition
suggested we should play
with mixed s i d e s . (No —
Indians and C h i n e s e you
fool!) T h i s proved a more
even affair despite the
final scoreline of 5 — 1 to
the Reds - at least some
of us members got their
names on the score sheet.
(Uh, what score sheet?).
T h i s week sees the start
of our annual competition
against U C C h i n e s e Society.
We shall be playing them at
soccer, snooker, table tennis,
basketball, badminton, squash,
swimming, C h i n e s e C h e s s ,
International C h e s s , bridge
and table tennis. The
competition w i l l span about
3 weeks, so if you have
an aptitude for any of these
events please contact the
Committee. However, (or
also), if your talents have
continued on page 10
