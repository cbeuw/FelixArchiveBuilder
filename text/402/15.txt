CROSS C O U N T R Y
On Wednesday the 15th
the X-Country C l u b descended
on Guilford for a quick 6 man
by -\u mile relay round the
Cathedral. The first team,
fortified by the i n c l u s i o n
of sprinter Dave West and by
the return of something rapidly
approaching fitness of Steve
Webb, eventaully finished 6th
out of about 30 teams; their
best performance in this
event for some years.
Unfortunately it was not
raining so Borough Road
were there â€” otherwise we
would have done even better.
Rob A l l i n s o n on the first
leg, came home fourth
with our fastest time, 8m
13s, following which- Dave
Rosen, Steve, Dave W
and Paul C l a r k e were
battling against stronger
opposition (but hanging on
well) until finally Ian E l l i s
completed the team's per-
formance with a time of 8m
41s: this followed an earlier
run by Ian on the second
lap for the C team, w e l l
It was decided after much
heated d i s c u s s i o n that an
unbiased match report should
be written, thus I (the goalie)
was chosen.
The team playing members
of the team seemed to think
that they had the match
sewn up with four goals in
twenty m i n u t e s , when
suddenly ... nothing happened,
for the rest of the first half
and fifteen minutes into the
next ... nothing further
happened. Then a shout from
the rear - "Spread it wide"
timed in 10m 54s, during
which h i s much p u b l i c i s e d
attributes were kept strictly
under control.
On the second lap for
the B team, A l f Garnett
showed a w e l l turned-ankle
with an unexpectedly fast
time of 8m 37s. The other
more sedantry runners in
this team were Dave J o n e s ,
Alan Leakey, C o l i n Dale,
Pete Johnson and a new
star Mike D a l e y . The third
team, which was at one
time last, eventually managed
to beat some of the school
teams: the team featured
Mike Welford, not only running
twice (!) but a l s o beating
rival Andy Davey, and
Dave J and Rob both complet-
ing a second lap. The journey
home featured a round of
a'pplause when the c l u t c h
on the van decided to work
in one of its less stubborn
(the hockey ball!) worked
miracles. A frozen J . L .
received two b a l l s in less
than a minute. T h i s shocked
him into life and h i s return
pass ied to the first of four
more goals. IC once more
eased off and the fullbacks
nearly made a disastrous
moments: for related remarks
see F E L I X No. 351.
On Saturday the usual IC
hordes were reduced to
three in number for the U L
match against Oxford and
Birmingham U n i v e r s i t i e s at
Oxford. The coach at Ma let
Street suprised everyone
by being fifteen minutes
early: unfortunately it had
already sprung a leak so it
left a more traditional half
hour late. Having c i r c l e d
Oxford's Ring Road and
stopped three cars on a
roundabout for directions,
the famous Iffley Road track
was found overgrown with
green stuff (precise botanical
specification unavailable) and-
reduced to four lanes.
However, two coaches
containing 18 enthusiastic
and fit U L runners and various
odds and sods from the
other U n i v e r s i t i e s set off
mistake! I actually had to
move! Dropping my fag, I
ran out from the goal and
kicked the ball clear. From
the look of surprise on our
C a p t a i n ' s face at that
moment, I can conclude
nothing. After this, the
only notable event of the
from here looking for the
course: this was discovered
hidden in a bank of fog and
a heavy shower of rain at
the top of some h i l l . T h i s
h i l l was very high as we
found later on having to run
up and down it and round
something of a switchback
course three times. T h i s 6
and a bit miles completed,
the results were computed,
and thus approximately
we had Birmingham University
places 1 to 15, Oxford
University 16 to 33, U L 34
to 52. There were some
exceptions - notably third
home for U L at 22nd Dave
Rosen, formerly of Oxford
but now of IC, one bound to
go far (at least 50 miles a
week.) Further down the
field, in the main U L pack
was Dave Jones at 39th;
John Shearer, the third IC
representative, found four
miles on this, very murky
day more than enough and
joined the D N F ' s .
match, the ball went into
our opponents net three
more times before the
final whistle was blown
by our Chairman; Many
thanks! To avoid being
murdered I shall now list
the goalscorers:- Mike Isles 5,
Trev Tutu 4, A l i s t a i r R o s s 1,
Own G o a l s 1 and C h a s
Hardy x (we lost count of
the number he missed).
Team:- J Marshall (capt),

Imperial College Hockey 3rd XI
Last Saturday, our sadly
depleted 3rd team arrived
at L i t t l e Harlington for a
match against the Hayes 4th
X I . We were only eight
strong a s D Balderstone,
the captain of the 2nd XI, had
commandered two players
for his use. We a l s o had to
resort to a kicking-back as
all our goalkeeping gear had
been requisitioned by the
1st XI (owing to the efficiency
of J Martial-arts).
On being informed of our
plight, the Hayes captain
lent us one of h i s players.
Thus, outnumbered ten to
Five members travelled to
Woods in Suffolk, last Sunday
to compete in the Icenian
Trophy Event. The terrain
was very flat and fast, and
the controls were generally
easy to find, giving the fast
runners an advantage.
However, there was a high
density of control points in
the forest, and several people
nine we started the game..
Almost from the bully-off,
IC's superiority was
evident. The forwards
attacked confidently and the
wings were used extensively.
The defence had enough of
a game to prevent them getting
bored.
David Carl lie, our ever-
grinning right winger, scored
the first g o a l . Hayes then
managed to draw even.
David C a r l i l e retaliated
with our second goal. The
were disqualified for visiting
the wrong control.
Provisonal Results:
'A' course 13.4Km
2nd David Rosen 87mins 42sec
Alan Leakey 105mins lsec
' B ' course 9.0Km
next three goals came in
rapid s u c c e s s i o n . The
first of these was by Edmund
Reed, our left winger. The
next one came from (yes,
guessed it) David C a r l i l e ,
who thus qualified himself
to buy us a ' J u g ' (which
we're s t i l l waiting for).
Christopher Parker netted
the fifth goal: this was a
rising shot from the edge of
the ' D ' and which went in
just under the crossbar.
The Hayes man lent to us
6th Tony Warwick 93mins 15sec
H' coarse 3.0Km
5th Martin Kessler 41mins 15 sec
The club will be going to
Bagley Wood near Oxford for
a small event next Sunday
(November 23rd). However,
scored the sixth goal and
David C a r l i l e slotted in the
seventh.
The rain made things
awkward, e s p e c i a l l y in the
second half when it came
down in sheets, virtually
blinding the bespectacled
players. Nevertheless, it
was a most enjoyable game
and we look forward to
playing them again next
season.
Team:- M Bachrynowski, PC
Nair, K Shine, T Sethi, C
Parker (capt,), D Carlile,
J Brownridge, E Reed, plus
a Hayes man.
closer to home on Wednesday
November 26th, the club is
organising an introductory
event on Hampstead H e a t h .
Beginners will be very
welcome to both of these
events, particularly the
Wednesday oup. A party
will be leaving the Onion
Entrance Hall at 1.00pm.
