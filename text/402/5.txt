Rag Procession

Make no mistake, this was
not a good Rag P r o c e s s i o n .
It wasn't cosmic, or astral.
It was absolutely galactic.
But to set the scene ...
8.15am on Saturday morning
sees rain. Down at IF a
few hardy perennials (ie
not me) were sticking paper
flowers on a 40 — foot trailer
— not an easy task. John

cheery Rag Co-ordinator, is

busily waking up Southside
with a l o u d h a i l e r -
unfortunately everyone's dead
for the morning. Then, in
what seemed like only a
few seconds, but was in
fact an hour, " t h e whole

The whole d e l i c i o u s mellee
was headed by Biggies and

Sir John Guilgood, and Stanley

intrepid heroes? Not on

G u i l d s C a r n i v a l , last
Friday, proved to be as good
as w e had a l l hoped. The
evening kicked off a few
minutes late when the
O x c e n t r i c s , complete with
boaters, set off into their
style of super-swing jazz.
They went down very well
and it is rumoured that even
the President of C & C w a s seen
dancing to them albeit to
only one number — ' T h e
Tiger R a g ' .
Ten minutes after they
finished, Roger Ruskin
Spear took the stage only
to leave it again within
30 seconds. Later he returned
shouting, "Good evening
everybody", to which everyone
replied, as one, "Balls".
A good start and the humour
c o n t i n u e d w h e n A n d y
" T h u n d e r c l a p Newman joined
him on the stage amidst
firecrackers and robots. A l l
in a l l an amusing set which
was well appreciated.
After the rag lottery
draw, during which many
hands went into the hat, the
stage was set for S t a n s h a l l ' s
Vivarium. There was only one
difficulty, at 10.57pm, V i v
Stanshall had not arrived.
Just before eleven o ' c l o c k
he appeared and was on stage

ten minutes later playing
some well known Bonzo
songs; ' J o l l i t y F a r m ' , 'Hunting
Tigers' and ' M r A p o l l o ' .
Unfortunately the P A was not
very good and deterioiated
when somebody
mixer onto the
a lot of people
set and after a
there was a big
removal to clear
knocked the
floor. S t i l l ,
enjoyed the
brief encore
equipment
the stage
for the films. The first film
" P e r c y " began at 12.45am
to a fairly full concert h a l l ,
indeed, some people at the
back complained of not being
able to see. A short break at
2.30 enabled people to u s e
the last of the bar extension.
The second film, " T h e P a r t y " ,
starred Peter Sellers and
was much enjoyed by those
who were not following the
example of K A and SW who
crashed out on the floor. It
was a l l over at 4.30 and I
must thank a l l those who
helped to clear up, those who
helped throughout the night,
Dramsoc, Brendon and h i s
barstaff. R i z without whom
the evening would not have
run a s smoothly as it d i d and
last but not least, to the
G u i l d s E n t s Committee who
did a l ! the donkey work to
get it organised In the first
place.
