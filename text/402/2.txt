Protection under the rent acts
Dave Rawnsley - Student Residence Officer
Here i s a l i t t l e advice on harassment and unlawful e v i c t i o n ,
security of tenure and rents. Further details may be obtained
from the Rent Officer, 90 Cromwell R o a d (on the corner o f
Gloucester Road), your l o c a l town hall or from me i n the Union
Office.
1. Protection against e v i c t i o n
and harassment.
It i s a criminal offence for
anyone to turn y o u out of
your home without a court
order or to try to drive you
out using threats, violence
b u l l y i n g , or any other type
of interference.
If you are lawfully occupy-
ing a house, flat or rooms
as your home and anyone
tries to treat y o u in- this
way, y o u should inform your
local c o u n c i l . They have
power to prosecute and
there are heavy penalties
on c o n v i c t i o n . T h i s basic
projection applies to everyone.
Tenants of private landlords
have the additional rights
described here under "security
of tenure" and "Rents".
2. Security of tenure
a) Protected tenancies.
Tenants of furnished and
unfurnished houses and
flats or rooms which are not
part of their landlord's home
with a rateable value not
exceeding £1500 in London
are protected by Rent A c t
security. Only the court
can order such tenants to
leave even if a notice to
quit has expired or a fixed
term tenancy has ended. T h e
The court cannot make such
an order except on grounds
laid down in the 1968 Rent
A c t , a s amended by the
1974 Rent A c t — for example,
that the tenant i s not paying
the rent, or i s causing annoy-
ance to the neighbours, or is
damaging the landlord's
furniture.
b) L e t t i n g s which are part
of the house i n which the
landlord l i v e s .
Except for those tenants
of unfurnished accommodation
who lived in the same house
as their landlords before
14 August 1974, those in
accommodation which is part
of thier landlord's own home,
and where the rateable value
of the part they occupy does
not exceed £1500 in London,
can apply to the Rent
Tribunal if they receive
notice to quit, to have the
effect of the notice postponed.
The address for Kensington
and C h e l s e a is Newlands
House, 37/40 Berners Street
London W1P 4 B P ( T e l :

from 9.30am till 4.30pm Monday
to F r i d a y . Y o u must apply-
before the notice expires. (At
least four weeks' warning in
writing must be given for the
notice to be valid). Rent
Tribunals c a n give tenants
up to s i x months' security at
a time. If you live outside
Kensington and C h e l s e a the
address of your rent tribunal
may be obtained from your
local c o u n c i l offices or
C i t i z e n s A d v i c e Bureau —

(Tel 960 3322 or 969 2433
or 250 K i n g ' s Road SW3 ( T e l

3. Rents
a) Protected tenancies
1. Regulated tenancies
A tenancy of a dwelling
which is protected by Rent
Act security, but i s not
controlled (see below) i s
c a l l e d a regulated tenancy.
The Rent Officer w i l l
determine a fair rent for a
reguI ated tenancy on app I icati or
by the tenant or by the
landlord or by both of them
together. If either landlord
or tenant objects to the Rent
Officers determination he w i l l
pass the matter to a Rent
A s s e s s m e n t Committee who
w i l l settle it after hearing
both s i d e s . When a rent has
been registered y o u cannot
lawfully be required to pay
more unless the increase is
i) to take account of any
increase in rates ii) to take
account of the cost of
improvements i i i ) to take
account of an increase in the
fuel, whenever the rent
includes an element for fuel
using services or iv) where
the tenant is a student and
the landlord i s an educational
institution. F o r further details
see the booklet 'Your Rents,
Rights and R e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s '
obtainable free from Rent
officers.
2. Rent agreements
Under the Housing F i n a n c e
A c t 1972, Landlords and
tenants may agree rent
increases between themselves'.
Agreements must be in
writing. T h i s w i l l not
interfer with your right to
apply for registration of a
rent at any time.
3. Controlled tenancies
These are tenancies which
date from before 1957 and
remained controlled after
the 1957 Rent A c t . If a
d w e l l i n g let on a controlled
tenancy i s certified by the
local authority a s being in
a good state of repair, the
tenancy comes out of control
and becomes regulated (see
above). Rents for controlled
tenancies were fixed by the
Rent A c t of 1957. They c a n
be increased only if the
landlord pays the rates and
these go up or if the landlord
improves or repairs the
dwelling and then only by
