Gong/Clear Light Orchestra (Great Hall)
Ian Morse
Attracting the largest audience yet
seen at IC this s e s s i o n , Gong went a
long way toward making the gig a l s o
the most musically satisfying.
They seemed much stronger than
the last time I saw them a few months
ago, with regard to the direction their
music should take, probably finally
shaking off the after effects of the
departure of mentor and guiding light,
Daevid A l l e n . Although it would be
unfair to say that the band has improved
since the leaving of A l l e n , it would be
true to say that under the assumed
leadership of Steve H i l l a g e , they are
concentrating to a greater degree on
the instrumental side of their ideology,
breaking away from A l l e n ' s often
monomanic obsession with l y r i c s about
pot-head p i x i e s , flying teapots and
other esoteric peculiarities of the
planet Gong.
Whether or not you are able to get
off fully on the band's music depends
as much as anything on the type of
grass that grows at the bottom of your
garden, but even so one could not help
but appreciate the fine m u s i c i a n s h i p
displayed by the band during a set that
included material mostly from ' Y O U ' and
' F I S H RISING', as well as some new,
unrecorded tunes. Particularly elevating
was flautist/saxophonist DidierMalherbe,
who as well as having a sure technique,
displayed a fine melodic sense throughout,
e s p e c i a l l y with h i s use of an Echoplex
during h i s orientally-inspired flute
feature. Hillage too, was as tastefully
economic with h i s guitar work as ever,
whilst what seems at last to be a
permenant rhythm section laid down
a s o l i d , inventive foundation for the
rest of the musicians to build o n . After
a performance that lasted almost ninety
minutes, the suitably impressed audience
brought them back for a deserved
encore.
If Gong's music was a well executed
as it was conceived, the same cannot
be said of the support act. C l e a r Light
Orchestra seemed to be a band with
admirable intentions but lack the
musical capacity to carry them off.
Attempting to emulate the innovatory
ensembles of the past few years,
the obvious influence of Lifetime and
to a lesser degree Matching Mole could
be heard protruding through the
Conglomeration of sound they produced
during the two over-long pieces played.
They had neither the musicianship nor
the intelligence to pull them through, the
overall effect being a muffled psuedo-
complex whole, at their nadir (which
they seemed to arrive at with excruciating
regularity) giving the impression of
blindmen wading through a torrent of
turd.
N B Special mention should go to
Andy and h i s henchmen, who handled
the affair with typical panache. These
hard working lads of the E n t s Committee
deserve a l l the credit they have told
me to give them. A l w a y s the height of
diplomacy and decorum, they work hard
day and night in order to make the
Saturday night concerts a s u c c e s s . Why,
often I have seen them outside concert
h a l l s throughout London, shivering in
the cold night a i r , with handouts
depicting coming events at IC, relentless
in their task ...

"The Playboy of the Western World"
For those of you who, like me, had
Synge's "The Playboy of the Western
World" rammed down your throats at
school, the best antidote has just
joined the National Theatre's repertoire,
in their last season at the Old V i c
thecompanygivesan electric performance
of this Irish C l a s s i c .
The basic plot is simple, Christopher
Mahon arrives in a remote village on
the West coast of Ireland and is pressed
to admit that he has killed h i s father
with one blow of h i s spade. Instead
of turning him over to the police, the
innocent inhabitants make him a hero
and two women propose marriage.
N e e d l e s s to say h i s father arrives
and when this i s i made public the
admiration of the hero turns to angry
contempt, dispite C h r i s t y ' s s u c c e s s
in carrying off a l l the prizes at the
local sports.
At the first performances in Dublin
by JM Synge The National Theal
in 1907 riots were organised by the
N a t i o n a l i s t s , angry at Synge's portrayal
of Irish peasants as unfaithful and
harbourers of murderers. Unfortunately
they missed the point that, at that
time, the Irish peasantry were de-
moralised, scraping a meagre existence
off the barren ground, and ready to look
for a hero in any likely candidate.
Stephen R e a , perhaps better known
as the taciturn Carter Brandon in the
B B C ' s recent comedy series, "/ Didn't
Know You Cared", plays a similar
character in C h r i s t y , particularly
effective when the locals are pressing
him to find put why he is behaving
with such reticence.H is total bewilderment
at the situation in which he finds
himself is another variation on the
victim as hero, for, despite a knowledge
of h i s wrongdoing, the audience is
persuaded to see him a s hero too. A
situation made a l l the more credible
At The Old V i c
by the remoteness of the setting.
If the thought of mock Irish accents
worries you, then you need have no
fears for almost the entire cast is
Irish and, although the sense is sometimes
difficult to follow the sound is sheer
poetry. T h e language Synge uses is
authentic, for he spent several seasons
in the Aran Islands at the suggestion of
WB Y e a t s .
One of the most effective parts of
the play is the description of the races.
The set i s ingeniously designed s o
that the characters can go outside the
the cottage, where the" main action
takes place and provide a running
commentary of the events on the sands
below. Geoffrey Scott's attention to
detail is terrific.
Students' standby tickets may be
available from 6.30pm for 90p.

"Song Of A s i a "
Westminster Theatre
Without prior knowledge or
a fair amount of diligence, it
would be almost impossible
to discover the existence of
this show, which runs until
November 29th, Wednesdays
to Saturdays only. The common
publicity channels seem to
be ionoring it, although the
Christmas show at the same
theatre is already being
advertised. However, those
who bother to make the short
journey to V i c t o r i a w i l l be
rewarded with a captivating
evening.
The idea for this musical
sprang from the 'Ceasefire'
two and a half years ago in
Vietnam. Young A s i a n s m e e t i n g
at the Moral Rearmament
Centre in Panchgari, India
felt that more fundamental
remedies were needed in
A s i a , and decided to present
their ideas t h r o u g h a
combination of dance, music
and drama. The show has
appeared in India, Vietnam and
Laos, and arrives in England
at the end of a six-month
tour of Europe. The members
of the cast, 45 in a l l , are
unpaid, and many had given
up their possessions to be
with the show.
T h i s being so, it w a s no
surprising that one of the
first things that strikes you
about the musical is the
conviction with which the
cast convey their ideas. T h e
short scenes, which are
linked by bouts of amusing
repartee between a naive
young Indian and an old
sage, are mainly drawn from
the real-life experiences
of members of the cast, and
depict moments of c r i s i s ,
where decisions based on
hate and deceit are readily
taken, which lead inevitably
to further pain and suffering.
The examples taken range
from petty family squabbles
to matters involving large
communities, as in the
Papua copper dispute. In
the climax, a story about the
ceasefire in Vietnam, a
villager who has seen h i s
two brothers shot down
mercilessly by guerillas i s
torn between seeking revenge,
and trying to reason with
the k i l l e r s . "// / have the
courage to kill a man", he
s a y s , "why can't I have the
courage to love him enough
to make him different".
It is this feeling which runs
throughout the m u s i c a l , and
is reflected in the songs
and dancing.
The music is provided by
an authentic c o l l e c t i o n of
A s i a n instruments, the
musicians loooking rather
cramped in the small box
provided, but sounding
excellent, and the dances,
deriving from a wide variety
