Rag Procession
with the IC Rubber J a z z
Band, and the florists shop
that was I F ' s float, we
s a l l i e d forth. A word of
thanks to the J a z z B a n d .
They were superb. That
five guys can play five
different tunes at the same
time over such a long period
is unbelievable. A c k e r B i l k ,
watch out.
And so, to the procession...
P C B607 led the way.
The Japanese tourists on top
of the Albert Memorial thought
the R u s s i a n s were coming,
the Kings Road thought an
open asylum had moved in,
and Carol chatted everyone up.
The Mines p i t h e a d got
demolished by every passing
tree, even with Howard
" S m e l l y S o c k s " Cheetham
perched on top like some
black and gold canary.
The policemen, cunning
as a brace of foxes, piled
onto the omnibus, and were
last s e e n d e v o u r i n g
B r a s s n e c k ' s beer along Sloane
Street. When he reported the
incident later, the police
couldn't trace the fourteen
gentlemen, a l l over 5ft 10in
Mines energy, what's yours?

a tendancy towards admini-
stration, perhaps you would
like to join the Chinese
Society Committee. There
are s t i l l two or three
outstanding posts vacant
and we would greatly welcome
some first years to serve
as Committee members.
A final note on behalf of
the Society: we would like
to wish our new president
(elected while F E L I X was
going to press) the best
of luck and s u c c e s s during
his term of office.
S A M U E L S H E N
P u b l i c i t y Officer.,
Arm in arm with the law — what next?
tall responsible for this
affront.
Eventually, with only
minor mishaps we arrived
back at college. G u i l d s s t i l l
had Bo in one piece, IF
hadn't lost their new mascot
(oh, what a give away) and the
police, who had been ordered
to " f o l l o w the procession
wherever it w e n t " dutifully
followed us into the Union
Bar. Whilst Brendon was being
rushed to hospital (another
shock victim) we exchanged
memories of police college,
life in general, Everton's
chances of winning the C u p ,
and whether Carol could
really hide in a certain
policeman's helmet.
The day ended at c l o s i n g
time. John Guilgood s t i l l
hadn't come; a circufe had
run away with the jazz
band, we're a l l nuts, I'm having
treatment, see you next year.
Thanks to: Brassneck, P C
B607, Watneys (for the lorry),
M i c h e i i n , Brendon, Mercedes-
Benz, Marge, Carol (wherever
you are), N i c k , Steve, Keith,
L i s a (I remembered), and
the Metropolitan P o l i c e . We
love you a l l .
