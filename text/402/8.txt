Morphy Day
ON T H E 21st March 1920, an RSM rowing eight beat C & G over
a one mile course; this was the first time the colleges had raced
s i n c e the revival of their individual rowing clubs after the 1st|
Warld War. Mr Arthur Morphy, father of the G u i l d s ' stroke,
Donal W Morphy, presented a cup which he had donated for the
o c c a s i o n .
The race became known
as the Morphy Cup Race, to
be competed for on M O R P H Y
D A Y .
Over the years, a side-
event has become more
popular, and now attracts
more spectators than the
actual boat races. T h i s
event is the battle between
C i t y and G u i l d s and a
combined R C S / R S M team
for an oar â€” the Morphy
Oar. There are few rules for
the contest. The partaking
teams line-up, facing each
other on the tow-path alongiside
the Thames at Putney; about
half a mile upstream from
the College boat house. The
three presidents of the
Constituent College Unions
exchange " p i e s " and the
battle begins; the winners
being the possesors of the
oar when the combatants
have run out of m i s s i l e s ,
drop 'dead' from exhaustion,
or are overcome by the
pervading odours.
Thus the scene was set
for this year's event. R C S /
RSM, the holders from last
year, were clearly the
favourities this time due to
their superiority in numbers
over the opposition, City
and G u i l d s . They out-
numbered G u i l d s by two to
one.
G u i l d s morale was never-
theless high; they were
clearly relying on quality
rather than quantity.
The rival groups stood
poised, confronting each
other across a fifty feet gap.
The thr.ee C C U presidents
assembled in the middle, and
the adjudicator Mr John
Downs, gave the signal
to exchange pies and begin
the battle.
Mr Downs, unfortunately
was towards the river, and
did not notice, passing behind
him, a member of the public.
The Fates had contrived to
take the poor innocent on a
walk along the tow-path, and
to bring him between the
opposing forces at precisely
the moment the action
began. He probably backs
losing horses as w e l l , such
is life! Immediately, he
disappeared, as did everyone
else, under a thick, black
cloud of carbon black and
flour, dense with projectiles.
When the cloud lifted,
it was obvious (from the
smell), that both sides had
been slowly preparing for
weeks beforehand.
The superiority in numbers
told almost immediately;
C & G being driven back, but
fighting a courageous rear
guard action. Meanwhile,
the oar was being removed
by RSM.
R e l e n t l e s s l y , R C S added
insult to injury by acquiring
Guilds tug-o'-war rope which
was tied around two trees.
Humiliation stirred G u i l d s
into action and they launched
a counter attack, which
was quickly quoshed. G u i l d s
periodically surged forward,
but each time were held, the
surges grew weaker, like
an ebb tide, and the initial
favourites undoubtedly won
the Day.
The police arrived during
t h i s epic struggle and looked
on with amused tolerance,
from the safety of a panda
car parked 200 yards away.
They finally became bored
and drove away.
A small break with
tradition occurred outside the
College Boat House after
the main B a t t l e . A l f ' s
Imperial Army massed their
whole strength and marched
down the road in a rowdy
mob of seven. Guildsmen,
Miners and Scientists lingering
outside the Boat House,
incensed, forgot their previous
differences and A l f ' s Army
finished their march in the
river. R C S , in really acquisitive
mood, purloined A l f ' s flag.
Pleased with their efforts,
several members of R C S
rounded the day off with tea
at Harrod's.
Sad to relate, therefore,
that Donald W Morphy, who
was a keen Old Centralian,
and later became famous as
half of "Morphy R i c h a r d s " ,
died earlier this year. H i s Day
is perpetual memorial.
