CND Issue
People have already started
questioning my political bias in
publishing a CND feature this
week so perhaps a few words of
explanation will not come amiss.
Although I am sympathetic to
the ideals of the CND movement
I believe it would be an abuse of
my position to use FELIX as a
means of promoting these
beliefs. However I do feel that
people's thinking about nuclear
arms needs to be regularly
stimulated (whatever their
feelings) and when several
people asked me independently
if I would include an article in
FELIX covering some aspects of
the nuclear debate, it seemed
logical to include them all
together in one issue. Inevitably,
a large amount of the material
has been written by members of
C N D , and in particular by
Robert Kelsey. I make no
apology for this; it is simply an
extension of the usual 'Opinion'
column which frequently app-
ears in FELIX. One thing which
EDITORIAL
I should perhaps apologise for is
the way I referred to this as a
'CND issue' in last week's
editorial, thus misleading some
people into thinking it would be
used as a vehicle for my own
propaganda.
Naturally Consoc and other
interested bodies will be allowed
the right of reply; indeed their
chairman John Pattison has
already arranged for FELIX to
interview Lady Olga Maitland.
Finally, to J Martin Taylor
who not only interviewed Philip
Webber and Neil Turok, but
also coordinated all the CND
pages and supervised the laying
out and pasting up, I offer my
thanks for the huge amount of
hard work it involved.
Flashing
One of the more disturbing
aspects of the flasher in the
Union gym was his method of
entry. The first time he visited
the building he had to force a
door to gain access. This forced
door was not reported to
Security, and the intruder was
able to continue using it until the
night he was caught. Mr Reeves,
head of College Security, has
asked me to remind you of the
importance of reporting any
similar damage to College
buildings as soon as they are
noticed.
Bicycles
Yes, again. If you have bicycle
which is frequently locked up
around College, make a note of
its frame number and get it
registered with Security, no
matter how safe you think it is.
A bicycle was stolen last week
from the top floor of the
Sherfield building—it seems no
one is immune.

A STORY FROM the Silwood
ball, where Chas Fuller, as a
member of the RCS Exec, was
one of the few souls left clearing
up after the party was over. All
the coaches had ferried the
guests back to IC , and the
clearer-uppers were being driven
home in dribs and drabs in other
vehicles.
Eventually the very last car
arrived to take people home.
The driver loaded up with
passengers and enquired if there
was anyone left in the building,
whereupon the other passengers,
still enjoying the post-party
euphoria, answered that since
the hall had been completely
cleared except for Chas, they
might as well set off for London.
And so they did, and the
unhappy Mr Fuller was left to
find his own way back from
Silwood, which he had done by
about 3 o'clock the following
afternoon.
T H O S E O F Y O U who are
regular readers of this column
will remember that last week I
described the pomposity and
prentention of many press
releases. This week, I shall give a
taste (in more senses than one)
of one of the most entertaining
press releases ever to reach my
desk.
It came from a Mr Cecil
Gysin who, the heading tells me,
forms half of the directorship of
Gysin and Hanson Ltd, the

other half, surprisingly, not
being Mr Hanson but one H Z D
T M E Esterhavzy.
Gysin and Hanson Ltd are
producers of natural sausage
skins, and the press release goes
to extraordinary lengths to
convince me of the superiority of
'natural' skins, which are made
from intestines, over 'repro-
cessed' skins, made from the
inner membrane of the hide of
the animal.
THE SAUSAGE-
AND ITS SKIN
A guide to o n e of the w o r l d ' s
m o s t popular f o o d s
The accompanying literature
is produced by the Natural
Sausage Casings Association,
which must surely qualify as the
world's most obscure pressure
group. The sausage, it points
out, is the world's oldest
convenience food and the
brochure goes on to explain
in detail some rather more than I
wanted to know about sausages,
including its history, hints on
cooking it, recipes using it, and
(most importantly) how to tell
whether the skin on your
sausage is naturally salt-covered
or whether it is the inferior and
ignoble reprocessed collagen
variety.
In case any of my readers are
as ill-informed as I was, and are
puzzled and concerned over the
intricacies of the humble sausage
and the irreversable physical and
mental damage which may be
produced by continued con-
sumption of reprocessed sausage
casings, let me as a public service
outline just a little of what I have
learnt.
The first literary mention of
the sausage is Homer's Odyssey,
which was written in 850BC,
although, the brochure says, sau-
sages were recorded'in Asia Minor
in 6000BC (presumably in a
prehistoric sausage recording
studio, another first for radio
over print). We are then led to
consider whether Roman orgies
were so popular because saus-
ages were eaten there, and
ponder the fact that Constantine
made sausage-eating illegal
when he embraced Christianity.
The best sausages, we are told,
are to be seen in butchers' shops,
I M a y 13,19831
where they can be seen hanging
in luscious curves which tell you
they are in natural skins. Natural
skins will not burst during
cooking, are juicy and provide
additional protein, allow the
sausages to be neatly linked
without leaving unsightly folds
at the ends, and give the sausage
its attractive curve and an
appetising bloom.
Sausages should be fried tin
medium heat for 5-7 minutes on
each side. N E V E R PRICK
YOUR SAUSAGES.
But enough of the mouth-
watering brochure with its
tasteful logo, and back to Mr
Gysin's press release which
opens with the searching quest-
tions 'Why is there such a steady
increase in home sausage mak-
ing? Could it be the consumer's
objection to man-made collagen
casings so prevalent in super-
markets' products?' and goes on
to announce their pride that they
can now supply by mail order:
25 yards of natural hog
casing—encough to make 201b
of sausage—plus a recipe leaflet
(with instructions) and a pack of
ready-mixed herbs and spices. It
comes packed in a resealable tub
and will keep for 6 months in a
cool larder. £3 includes postage
and packing, and there is no
V A T to pay. The Welfare
Officer is already getting ideas....
