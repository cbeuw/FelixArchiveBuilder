John Lea after winning all the
middle distance races.
The 1983 Imperial College
Sports Day took place last
Saturday at Motspur Park.
Thankfully the weather re-
mained fine for the afternoon
and an enjoyable day was had by
all. Admittedly only 40 com-
petitors turned up, and among
these no women, but due to
very hard work by certain
people, D Molesworth, amongst
them, all events were highly
competitive.
Track Events
These were dominated by two
people: Mike Jones and Jon Lea.

Don't miss the
Mike Jones first won the 100
metres, then the 200m and
finally won a very close 400m.
Conditions, both underfoot and
a strong wind, were against fast
times. The distance events,
1500m, 3000m and 2000m
steeplechase were all won by Jon
Lea and in the main were
dominated by the cross-country
club. I don't think that anyone
realised quite how deep the
water was in the steeplechase! In
between these events Ming Tan
won convincingly in the 800m.
Field Events
The outstanding performance in
the field events was by Andy
Kruszewski who showed great
style in winning both the discus
and the shot put. Dave Moles-
worth finally won something
when he clinched the javelin
competition. Mick Jones again
appeared as a winner when he
took both the high jump and
long jump competitions. A
highly popular triple jump
competition was won by Andy
Davies.

To complete the day two 'fun'
events were held. The first of
these was the 4x100m relay. This
was supposedly an inter-CCU
event but since RCS could not
muster a team a mixed team
took their place—and promptly
won.
The second of these races was
a presidents race. Unfortunately
only one president could be
found—a certain Mr Goulder. A
Mines president elect was found,
C Crownshaw, as was a member
of the Guilds Exec, Mike Bartlett
RCS were represented by the
illustrious FELIX sports ed.
Numbers were made up by the
ACC Chairman—Ian Bull. The
race was won(?) by Mines and
Mr Goulder ended up very wet
and slightly sticky!
To sum up. A very good day
was had. Organisation was very
good considering the vast
inexperience of the organisers.
Thanks must go to Sarah, Sarah,
Ian, Steve and Chris and to all
competitors many of whom
completed the equivalent of a
pentathlon. The event was better
attended than last year and
hopefully next year will gain the
support of even more people.
Last but not least, Ben Quirk in the steeplechase
