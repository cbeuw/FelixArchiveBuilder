First Past
the Poll ^
The Social Clubs Committee will
spend up to £200 on a mock
election in June, it was announced
on Wednesday. Apart from the
fun element, the election aims to
compare different voting meth-
ods by holding polls both on the
Single Transferable Vote and on
the 'First Past The Post' system.
Voting will, be on June 2 and'
the results will be announced
that evening. All the major
political societies are expected to
participate; national political
parties are generally quite keen
to provide their own publicity
for mock elections. Anyone
interested in standing as a
candidate should contact the
Mock Returning Officer Jona-
than Miller, c/o Union Office.

Dear Martin
I would like to raise a few
points regarding last week's
opinion on Student Residence. I
felt that Ken's views were mostly
very valid though I must take

Going, Going,

Dr Don Monro is to resign as
Warden of Weeks Hall at the
end of this year, and it is not
clear whether he will be replaced.
The Lauwerys Report on Resi-
dence recommends that one
Warden should be responsible
for both Weeks and Garden
Halls; the Student Residence
Committee, of which Dr Monro
is Chairman, points out that the
two Halls are very much separate
entities, and recommends that
the post of Warden of Weeks
Hall should be advertised as
soon as possible.
Neither Dr Monro nor Jeremy
Turk, the Warden of Garden
Hall, have been told whether the
post will be filled.
High-rise
Flats
The Student Residence Com-
mittee has approved rent rises of
four per cent for most Halls and
Houses; exceptions are single
rooms in Montpelier, which
remain at their present rate, and
the Southside Penthouse flats,
which have again suffered large
rises to £140pw for four people.
The justification for this is that
there will always be wealthy
issue with his thoughts on the
compjsition of the Student
Residence Committee (SRC).
SRC is, as Ken correctly
states, the main policy forming
body (though technically only an
advise y committee) on Student
Residence. It is thus imperative
that its decisions should be made
in the light of the general
situation of the college, and with
a consideration of the long term
health of residences. Yet we see
Ken advocating representatives
of current residents being on the
committee.
I have sat on SRC for two
years, and have on several
occasions taken part in decisions
which sacrifice the short term
benefits of the current year's
residents for the longer term
benefits of the future. I feel that
such representatives would tend
to go for the short term alter-
native.
This could only lead to a loss
of credibility of SCR and this
committee would become an-

precaution.
Firemen arrived with pro-
tective clothing, which proved
unnecessary and as soon as the
alarm was over, the exams were
resumed with an allowance for
students at IC who will want
what is described as very
exclusive accommodation. These
flats, the Committee decided,
exist not as a service to students,
but to make money for College.
These suggested rates will now
go forward for the Rector's
approval.
In the meantime, negotiations
are still going ahead to extend
Imperial's use of the Head
Tenancies at Lexham Gardens.
The SRC was told on Wednesday
that one way or another negotia-

Furthermore, I take offense at
his suggestion that Union reps
don't have residents' interests at
heart—but then that's another
matter entirely.

Whilst I whole-heartedly

Beltane

Social Clubs Committee meet-

Miller had the application
thrown out after Ian Bull,
Athletics Club Chairman and a
would-be member of the society,
admitted that he did not know
the meaning of Beltane, one of
the major events of the s&tanic
calendar.
Mr Miller then ruled that the
society was not being formed for
authentic devil-worshipping
reasons so much as to embarrass
SCC in general and himself in
Ian Bull
particular. Mr Miller has just
withdrawn an application to
form a triangular football
society in ACC.
