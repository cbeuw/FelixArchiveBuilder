iCLUBS & SOCIETIES!
STOIC
And a very good first lecture to all of you,
especially :hose who saw Michael Palin on
Tuesday. We apologise for any convenience
caused by showing the programme at the
stated time. As this column has to be
submitted so far ahead of programme
transmission that I don't know what's on next
week, I can only say what we WON'T be
showing. So, we WON'T after all be
broadcasting a three-hour pornographic
extravangza to Southside; we can't really show
all the examination answers on STOICFAX;
and there will be no series of natural history
programmes detailing the innermost thoughts
of earthworms, wombats and IC students, nor
STOICVision Bucks Fizz look-alike contest.
In the meantime, keep watching—something
may slip out.
*F<D Soc
There were cries of disbelief around the audi-
torium. Several of the people gathered there
rose to their feet in protest.
'I know,' Doctor X shouted, 'that this, per-
haps sounds as if it contravenes the Law of
Conservation of Mass Energy, but not so. The
coefficient of restitution of the elastic is greater
than 100% because it absorbs energy from the
material it impacts with, even the very mole-
cules of the air. Therefore the material is both
extremely dangerous and extremely powerful.'
The pandemonium had died down as the
audience settled down again to this ludicrously
named Doctor X.'Thus the Russians and
Americans must not be allowed to learn the
secret of Prof Paul Stark's discovery'.His
voice rose to a hysterical level,'And it is for this
reason that Triumph must be stopped using
this elastic in their latest line of bras and
pantihose.'
A slide illustrating the effect of the
underwear on the young female form was
shown. There was wild applause and cries of
'Encore! Encore!'
