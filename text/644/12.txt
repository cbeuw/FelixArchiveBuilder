Ghent International Regatta
At 8:30am last Friday the Boat
Club Senior Squad set out for
Ghent in Belgium to enter the
international regatta. Ghent
provides early season experience
of racing high quality opposition
over a 2,000m multilane course.
The journey over to Belgium
was on a 'luxury' coach arranged
with London RC. After a guided
tour of most of Northern Europe
we arrived in Ghent at 6:00pm to
find that the boats had already
safely (?) arrived. Following a
short practise on the course,
we went off to find the accom-
modation provided by the
organisers. It turned out to be a
Nazi prisoner of war camp run
by Adolf Hitler's son hastily
disguised as a Belgian Youth
Hostel.
On the Saturday, the first
eight entered the open eights
event and the remainder of the
squad entered coxless fours. In
the heat of the eights, the
polished Cambridge University
crew got off the start very
quickly together with Dutch
club, Nereus leaving IC in third
place just ahead of the British
lightweight eight. With a storm-
er of a row, the IC crew pulled
back to come second to Cam-
bridge by one length, beating
Nercus by V 4 length and the
lightweights by l'/4lengths. In
the final IC were the slowest
qualifiers, but even so rowed a
disappointing race coming fifth
with Cambridge winning.
The coxless 4 produced an
excellent row in the heat in
winning by literally a couple of
incheks from a four from the
British lightweight squad. Their
time was the fastest of the
qualifiers. The two UL crews
were well beaten with times 5
and 13 seconds behind IC.
In the final the College four
had another good one coming
third behind a British heavy-
weight four all of whom had
won silver medals in Moscow,
but had not been pushed in the
heat.
On the Sunday the main
success was the under-23 coxed
four taken from the 1st VIII.
They rowed their heat at 7:30am
despite three man Andrew
Spalding being decidedly ill, and
qualified. In the final, following
a slow start, the IC crew pulled
through the massive German
four, who were last year's world
junior champions, to come
second winning the second
medal
The under-23 eight had a bad
row coming fourth in the final.
The coxless four again entered
the open event and having had a
bad row in the heat, only
qualified for the final when a
German crew dropped out.
Lying in third place with 500m
to go, the IC crew was ready for
the final push when the UL crew,
V 4 length down, spurted and
deliberately steered into IC,
robbing them of a medal. It is a
sign of the poor quality of the
UL crew when they have to
deliberately crash to prevent a
College crew from beating them.
Meanwhile, back in England,
the remainder of the boat club
was racing on the Thames in
London. On Saturday at Mort-
lake regatta, the senior B eight
failed to produce the form of
which they are capable, losing in
the final. The ladies novice 8
received no reward for enthus-
iastic training, losing to West-
minister Hospital in the final.
On the Sunday, at Vesta
Daskes, the Senior B eight broke
into two fours. The coxless four
had difficulties with the rudder
and lost by a canvas. The coxed
four managed to win their event
despite having to rerow the final
against Exeter University after a
dead heat.
All in all a successful weekend
for the Boa. Club. Dickhead of
the Belgian Tour award goes to
Peter McConnell who not only
steered the coxless four over
every lane of the course, but also
forgot his nissport!

IC vs Presidents XI 7-2
The game always promised to be
high scoring with both sides
pushing forward. However with
the First XIs defence being
rather better organised and
marking tighter it came as no
surprise when they raced to a
three nil lead with a shot (at
last) from Ayers and goals from
Parker (after a lot of effort) and
Realff.
At this point the Presidents
Captain Webb stole a rather
lucky goal from a defelction
within the firsts defence. Half-
time refreshments (champagne?)
were supplied by birthday boy
Eldridge, who obviously in-
tended to spur the lsts onto
greater things.
The second half was just as
exciting with the firsts pushing
forward and only being pre-
vented from scoring by a num-
ber of saves by Butler however
the lsts forward line's efforts
were rewarded by further goals
by Ayers (2), Bell and birthday
boy himself (on his second
attempt). This left the firsts in
jubilant mood, if not rather
slack in defence, and with
Stroomer, Gray and Clift it was
hardly surprising that they can
get everyone in defence flat
footed and Clift scored a well
deserved goal.
Umpires: D Hardwick, A
Whitehead.
1st Team: Jones, Riley, Cun-
ningham, Parker, Eldrige, Ayers,
Franklin, Realff, Bell, Garmes,
Dubenski.
Presidents: Butler, Clift,
Stewart, Coatesworth, Murrey,
Webb, Stroomer, Gray, Wigney,
modley.
PS: Many thanks to Dr and
Mrs Hardwick for the wonderful
meal after the game.
Tonight's the night we see the
Harlem Globetrotters at Wem-
bley; meet at the Sportscentre at
5:30pm for the tube. Apologies
to those who were unable to get
tickets.
Last week's issue of FELIX
should have contained a mam-
moth Squash Club tour report,
which is probably why it wasn't
printed. Never mind. The club
officers are instead currently
deciding whether to start their
own 'Spot the Ball' competition,
run along similar lines to those
in the popular press, to be
judged by the eminently quali-
fied Simon Roberts. However
the relevant sauna photo is a bit
strong and its publicity is
probably best confined to a
16x10" blow up on the notice-
board. Squash Club convey their
deepest sympathy to 'Sarah'.
Meanwhile Club memebers
continue to excell themselves in
other sporting fields, accumu-
lating an incredible 29 points out
of a 76 maxiumum during IC
Sports Day just last Saturday;
this included 7 1st places and 4
2nds.
in the ladies event with 32-29.
By contrast the 25 mile was
held in atrocious conditions on a
tough course near Lichfield.
John Gilday was again fastest in
1-2-32 finishing 9th overall.
Gary recorded 1-5-39 alnd
Ronan completed the team with
1-7-19. Riding his first '25' John
Storey coped well with, the
conditions to finish in 1-16-44.
Although IC had high hopes
of taking the team award in this
event they were beaten by a
strong Cambridge team by two
minutes.
IC Cycling Club came back
empty handed from the BSSF
10 and 25 miles championships
over May day weekend after
being beaten into second place
for the team award on both
occasions.
On Saturday, in fine weather,
near Gloucester John Gilday
lead the IC team in the 10 mile
championships with a good time
of 24-34. Making up the rest of
the team were Gary Hotchkiss
25-44 and Ronan McDonald
55. Beth Marcus finished second
