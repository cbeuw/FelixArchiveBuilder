Does the idea of not having to pay for your accommodation next year
appeal to you? If it does have you considered becoming a Head Tenancy
Warden or Manager?
• Managing a Head Tenancy
does involve a fair amount of
work but most of all it requires
an interest in Residence and a
commitment to making a
particular Head Tenancy a
success.
The Head Tenancies include
Hamlet Gardens, Lexham Gar-
dens (maybe), Earls Court
Square, Gerrard Mansions and
the Fremantle Hotel. Each of the
Head Tenancies belongs to an
outside landlord and is leased to
the College for one to three years
at a time.
We are now looking for a
Warden who will have res-
ponsibility in respect of all of the
Head Tenancies and there are
also vacancies for Managers in
some of the individual schemes.
The Warden is based at
Hamlet Gardens where a self
contained flat is available. As
well as running Hamlet Gardens
with, the help of a Manager, the
Warden is responsible for
arranging meetings with all the
Head Tenancy Managers and
representing them on the Stu-
dents' Residence Committee.
The ideal candidate for this
job would be a postgraduate
with at least two more years to
go, who has some experience of
the Head Tenancies and some
well developed ideas on how
they could be improved.
Incidentally, the accommo-
dation would be suitable for a
couple, so applications are
welcome from couples as well as
from single students.
The Manager's job is more
specific and can be considered
under three headings:
1. Domestic
Before Residents move in the
Manager is responsible for
making a note of the readings on
all gas and electricity meters, so
that any bills sent to students
can be verified. The Manager is
responsible for checking Resi-
dents in at the beginning of the
session and giving out keys.
Throughout the term, various
domestic supplies such as bin
bags, cleaning materials and
light bulbs are required. The
Manager is responsible for
obtaining these from the College
Stores.
In those Head Tenancies
where cleaners are employed, the
Manager should ensure that this
is properly carried out.
The landlord is usually res-
ponsible for the majority of
repairs but because repairs cost
money a Manager will soon
learn to detect just the slightest
hint of reluctance in the land-
lords manner when the question
of repairs is mentioned. Never-
theless, it is the Managers job to
report defects to the landlord
and encourage him to rectify
them.
At the beginning of each
session Managers should collect

a list of all existing defects. This
is partly to prevent the new
tenants being blamed for dam-
age caused by the previous
occupant.
2. Finance
The Manager is responsible for
collecting the bills and bill
reminders from Student Services
and delivering them to the
students. Prompt action is
essential in this area. Managers
are also expected to chase up
outstanding bills.
In some Head Tenancies,
Managers have to empty gas,
electricity and telephone meters.
Occasionally at the beginning
of the session, the Managers
collect any unpaid deposits as
students move in.
3. Social and Discipline
Much of the Head Tenancy
accommodation is in the form of
flats, which tend to generate
their own social life. Others are
more like Student Houses where
it is very important to give the
lead in organising social events.
In all the Head Tenancies the
Manager is responsible for
making sure that no nuisance is
caused to neighbours and that
no damage is caused to the
accommodation. Managers need
to have a weekly 'clinic' where
residents can report defects and
when other matters can be dealt
with.
Although this description
makes being a Manager look like
a full time job, in fact it is not as
bad as it sounds.
Most things only have to be
done once or twice a term and
are not particularly time con-
suming. Nevertheless, these jobs
involve a high degree of res-
ponsibility and committment
and if you are thinking of
applying you will need to talk to
your personal tutor or super-
visor before doing so.
The work tends to be concen-
trated into specific periods such
as the beginning of term (par-
ticularly in the first term).
Experience has shown that
research students find it easier to
reconcile the management role
with their academic work.
The job can be demanding at
times. Student Services is able to
help with many problems but the
Manager is often left to his own
devices.
Nevertheless it provides an
excellent opportunity for anyone
who is interested in Residence to
develop administrative and
management skills.
If you are interested, more
information is available from
Student Services. The closing
date for application is May 27.
