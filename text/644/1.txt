hostel next to the Royal Albert
Hall. The man had appeared
naked at the toilets' window
and, having attracted the atten-
tion of some girls in the hostel,
had started masturbating.
Mr Stentaford promptly
called Security Superintendent
Ron Barber who, led the male
intruder out of the gym and
called for a number of girls from
the hostel to identify him. The
police were then called.
The man had engaged in
similar acts several times over
the previous fortnight, but this
had never been reported by the
residents of Queen Alexandra
House.
The man had entered the
changing room through a back
door which he had forced open,
in order not to be seen by the
students using the gymnasium.
The door is now safely locked
. again.
