Towards the end of last term
Imperial College CND Group
took part in 'Peace Canvass 83'
which is a still-continuing
attempt by national CND to
canvass as many houses in
Britain as possible. Between
Monday 19 and Friday 25
March about half-a-dozen
members of IC CND canvassed
College Halls of Residence,
namely Holbein, Garden, Fal-
mouth Keogh and Linstead.
This involved knocking on
people's doors, and asking five
questions. (Not everyone was in,
and we couldn't do every Hall
because our numbers were
limited.) The Wardens of Weeks
and Selkirk-Tizard Halls denied
us permission to knock on
doors, so instead we handed out
leaflets in the form of question-
naires. Only nine of these were
returned, but they roughly
paralleled the overall results (as
did each of the houses individu-
ally).
The aims of the canvass are at
least twofold: to count existing
opinions on major issues of
nuclear defence, and to ensure
that people are aware of these
issues. We spent a lot of time

people, and at the-very least I
hope we made everyone think
about the importance of nuclear
disarmament.
The results are as follows,
derived from a sample of 234
people. Question five is now of
course highly relevant!
An /// Wind
When the Wind Blows by Raymond
Briggs, directed by David Neilson,
Whitehall Theatre.
When the Wind Blows is a play about civil
defence during a nuclear attack. Set in a
country cottage in the southeast of England,
Hilda and Jim (played by Patricia Routledge
and Ken Jones) are a retired working class
couple. It is a time of very grave international
tension — a crisis is imminent—and Jim
decides to build a shelter in their living room
according to the official governmental Protect
and Survive. Moments later, they hear a pre-
pack broadcast on the radio—enemy missiles
will strike in three minutes. In they go into their
shelter, a nuclear bomb detonates some way
off, their house is very nearly reduced to
rubble, but they survive. An intense quietness
and loneliness sets in. There is no water or
electricity. A day or two later they feel sick,
they pass blood, hair starts falling out and
enormous spots grow about their knees.
The play is a black comedy about thefutility of
civil defence for the purposes of surviving a
nuclear attack. The two characters are easily
defined. The wife doesn't want to think about a
thing like war—it has got nothing to do with her
daily work and its problems—it will never
happen. She is ignorant of the facts. But the
husband does know; he has his wits about him,
but submits to authority. They know best, he
feels. Needless to say, there are many such
characters in this country. Ignorance,
passivity and blind obedience to authority are
rife.
However the play is extraordinarily
unpretentious, low-key and dare I say it, even
simple. I honestly think the arguments about
nuclear defence and nuclear warfare have
come a long way since the realisation of the
hopeless inadequacy of second world war
F E L I X ^ H H I M I
defence methods in the face of spectacularly
sophisticated and destructive weaponry. I
think, and I hope, the public has moved on
from discussing those points raised in the play.
The Whitehall production is unquestionably
a piece of political theatre. The company and
its backers have obviously not put on the show
as a form of light relief after a hard day's work.
The intention of course is to get people to
appreciate the futility—the dangerous futility—
of the government's war preparations. But the
only people who would be changed by seeing
the play would be people like Jim and Hilda in
the play—people ignorant of the facts, people
indifferent to the situation, people who say
'yes' to authority, people who think the next
world war or a nuclear war will be like the last,
and people who haven't realised that each
nuclear bomb is now ten times as destructive
as the Hii-^shima one. There are plenty of
these people about but one has to ask whether
a theatre in arguably the smartest street in the
country is the place to reach them. A cursory
glance around the audience suggests not.
It is for this reasons that I cannot really
recommend the play to anyone at IC—anyone
that is who has taken the trouble to examine
the debate in a rational and intelligent way.
However the play does have its odd flashes of
cleverness and insight, as when Jim says of the
Russians 'democratic principles will be instilled
in them whether they like it or not' and when
Hilda often says 'Oh I'm sorry, I keep
forgetting. That was last time.' (ie the last war).
The play is quite goodatshowing the nostalgia
people have for a previous war—the
comradeship, the unity of purpose, and the
other 'advantages' of a war (a taboo subject).
Some pretty frightening electronic sounds,'are
used in the play to simulate nuclear sirens Snd
when 'the bomb' goes off an extremely loud
and long rumbling sound is relayed that
literally shakes the audience and the theatre.
It is a pity When the Wind Blows is so' low-
key. The whole debate about war and its
ethical and political consequences is discussed
in far more involved and provocative ways
elsewhere (such as at the National Theatre).
The Whitehall production is a contribution to
the debate, but, I fear, a minor one.
Nick Bedding
Don't expect me to try to tell
people how to vote: vote accord-
ing to your consciences on the
major issues. I think nuclear
disarmament is the most impor-
tant issue of all, for this country
and the future of all humanity.
