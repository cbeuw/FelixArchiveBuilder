As defence hots up as an election issue Robert Kelseyputs the case
for unilateral nuclear disarmament.
A S w o r d o r a Shield?
Few people doubt these days
that the arms race is madness.
Military expenditure is a waste
of the earth's resources. Billions
of pounds are spent each year on
weapons of mass destruction
which supposedly will never be
used; millions of people are
dying already from disease and
starvation. Individual nations
are themselves for more security,
but overall the world becomes
increasingly unstable. The
human race could be destroyed
by a nuclear war; a nuclear war
could be started by accident; an
accident is inevitable unless the
arms race is halted and re-
versed.
The question these days is a
matter of response to this
continuing crisis. There are
basically three schools of
thought: peace through strength,
multilateral disarmament and
unilateral disarmament. The
first two options are commonly
linked together; the second two
are not necessarily mutually
exclusive.
Peace through strength is
undoubtedly a silly policy. It is
short-sighted and insular,
neglecting the long-term effects
of an arms race and ignoring the
threat to global security. Al-
though there has been peace in
Europe—plenty of wars else-
where, but peace in Europe—for
the past thirty-eight years, does
that mean this peace will
continue for ever? If there is any
chance of an accident occurring,
then given indefinite time it will
happen. With the arms race
continuing, the nuclear balance
between East and West grows
ever more precarious, like two
piles of single bricks growing
more unstable as they get higher.
The situation is already absurdly
out of proportion, since both
sides are in possession of
overkill; it is worsened by
economic recession, aggressive
posturing and talk of war-
winning strategies.

From Russia's point of view
the policy of peace through
strength must have the appear-
ance of threatening behaviour.
Taken with subversion by the
C I A (principally in Latin
America), direct intervention
such as that in Vietnam, and
American forward bases in
Europe, the Russian threat
begins to look no worse than
that from America — it all
depends on where you stand.
The notion that we must arm
ourselves to negotiate from a
'position of strength' (that we
must arm ourselves to achieve
disarmament) is blatantly
contradictory. The policy of
peace through strength is self-
defeating anyway: increasing our
weapons strength to neutralise
the Soviet threat will only result
in the increase of that threat.
The Russians will not stand idly
by while we attain superiority,
and then allow us to dictate
conditions for disarmament.
They will pursue the same
strategy, and numbers of nuclear
weapons will rise to some new
plateau from which the whole
business will start all over again,
but with increased risks. The
proof of the pudding is in the
eating: multilaterial disarma-
ment negotiations have been
continuing, on and off, since
1963 (The Partial Test Ban
Treaty) with only limited suc-
cess. The arms race has barely
perceptibly slowed, neither
stopped nor reversed.
Far better would be to at-
tempt to de-fuse the Russian
threat, by removing one of our
bricks from the pile with no pre-
conditions. Then we could see if
the Russians respond, by re-
moving a brick from their own
pile. This process might continue
at least until both piles are
stable, it is a process of staggered
multilateral disarmament,
although each step requires a
unilateral initiative. Every time
we increase our weapons
Robert Kelsey
strengths it is a unilateral
escalation of the arms race, so
why not a unilateral decrease?
In this context it should be
noted that CND's immediate
policy is for Britain unilaterally
to abandon nuclear weapons (as
a first step towards a world free
from weapons of mass destruc-
tion). There is no implied inten-
tion that the West or NATO as a
whole should overnight disarm
itself completely—a common
fallacy. That would be to remove
one pile of bricks entirely,
whereas CND's conern is to
remove one brick as a unilateral
initiative. Another common
fallacy is that of Britain's
independent deterrent. We are
not an imperial power any more,
hardly a major one even; it's
about time we accepted this fact
and ceased wasting our money
on Polaris and Trident. No way
could we use them without
consulting NATO. As for Cruise
missiles, they are controlled not
by us but by America; the British
government has rejected sug-
gestions of a dual-key approach.
Japan has no nuclear wea-
pons, and they have more reason
than any other country to
protect themselves from a
nuclear attack. (Nuclear wea-
pons are nuclear targets.)
Austria and Finland have no
nuclear weapons, despite being
closely adjacent to Russia—they

obviously feel safer without
them. Canada, Norway and
Denmark, although they are
members of NATO, have not got
any nuclear weapons.
Switzerland has no nuclear
weapons, instead her defence is
truly defensive—it provides no
threat, whether real or per-
ceived. Deterrent defence, on the
other hand, maintains peace by
threatening offence; it is more,
like a sword than a shield. A
world in which everyone is
armed with swords is overall
more dangerous than one in
which some have swords and
others shields, or one in which
everyone has shields. America,
with its handguns, is overall
more dangerous than Britain.
The logical extension of peace
through strength is that every
country in the world has nuclear
weapons. Would there be no
wars, and would we then be safe?
A policy of unilateral nuclear
disarmament does not exclude
the possibility of multilateral
disarmament. Peace campaign-
ers are frequently charged with
jeopardising disarmament nego-
tiations, and of making war
more likely. But surely the
Geneva Talks on theatre nuclear.
weapons, President Reagan's
zero option, and President
Reagan's proposal of START
(Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks) have been prompted by
public opinion more than
anything else, and public opin-
ion has been prompted by peace
groups.
Would unilateral disarma-
ment by Britain make war more
likely? That is for individuals to
decide according to their con-
science. In the words of Bertrand
Russell 'Remember your human-
ity and forget the rest'.
