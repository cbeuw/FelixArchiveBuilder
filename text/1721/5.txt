Ideological purity and the Randos
Challenging transphobia will need more than demanding the deletion of some tweets, argues
Adam Kutnar.

S
o another student,
perhaps a cowork-
er (or if you can
imagine it, maybe
even your university’s
vice-provost of education)
has shared some bigoted
articles on their social
media. They follow the
twitter account of an or-
ganization that campaigns
to take away support from
trans children at school
and frequently retweets
Ray Blanchard, one of the
world’s best-known aca-
demic transphobes. Based
on their social media,
you might make some
sensible inferences about
what your friend thinks
personally and that some
of their worldview is not
as woke as you have come
to expect from your peers
in 2019. The beliefs this
person apparently holds
are clearly retrograde and
wrong, but they are not
what I want to talk about.
Last week, Felix re-
printed the public letter
to a member of the uni-
versity’s senior manage-
ment, asking them and
the college to reiterate
their support of trans
people and to respond
publicly to concerns
regarding their social
media sharing. Said
person has since they
were first approached
deleted the objectionable
tweets and unfollowed
the mentioned accounts,
but I do not know if
this step is necessarily
helpful towards LGBT+
liberation.
I am not saying that
Imperial does not still
have a long way to go
in terms of its treatment
of trans people. As the
letter itself cites, a sig-
nificant proportion feels
excluded and more help
needs to be made availa-
ble, but prescribing who
to follow and not follow
on social media will only
alienate, perhaps even
the specific person you
are trying to convince to
change their mind. Posts
on social media are
somewhere in the gray
zone between public
and private, but they
are some of the primary
ways we express our-
selves today and so
ought to be protected.
Bringing in the college
to enforce posting habits
means we are making
private support for trans
rights the ideological
litmus test for randos,
or rather, people whose
opinions on the matter
do not really affect
anything.
There is the question
of how visible and im-
pactful a person must be
before their thoughts and
self-expression needs to
be scrutinized, but in
this case I would say the
person is more in the let
it go category. I doubt
author and recipient
mention the opportunity
for “debate” somewhere
else, but, as Willsher
correctly identifies, that
can often be damaging
to trans people as it
makes their existence a
point a discussion and
something up for grabs.
Social media is not the
place for it, but neither
is probably a South
Kensington campus.
Privately approaching
someone is probably the
best way to convince
them, but that can
take years and is often
frankly just impossible.
But you have to try to
change minds, in a real
long-lasting way, not
just censor their tweets
and bringing in the
college.

their preconceptions.
When it comes to asking
others to take down
tweets, especially when
they were already more
than 6 months old when
found judging by the
Felix photo, it sounds
more like an exercise
of power rather than a
means social progress.
In the last paragraph
of the Felix article, Josef
Willsher, the author of
the letter, says of the
vice-provost using their
“public Twitter account
to engage with tweets
and to share articles…
we really didn’t think
it’s the place to do that”,
which, while begging
the question of what a
twitter account is for in
that case, is a sentiment
I sympathize with. Some
ideas are just awful and
we need a way to get
them out of people’s
heads. Both the letter’s
“Free speech
on college
campuses
is already a
talking point
for people
across the
right and we
should not be
adding fuel to
the fire”
most students or staff
could name the college
top administrative staff
beyond a few people, so
even at Imperial have
limited social influence.
Furthermore, it is not
part of the professional
obligations of the person
involved to set the col-
lege’s LGBT+ policies.
It is important to make
the distinction here
that these are personal
tweets and not college
endorsements and,
while they are a part of
a difficult trend among
middle-aged people
and some younger who
do not have much of
an excuse, it is not in
our right to censor and
limit them. Free speech
on college campuses is
already a talking point
for people across the
right and we should
not be adding fuel to
the fire and validating
