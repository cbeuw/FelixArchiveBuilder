Smash Corner: Weegee – wait no... it’s Luigi!..
Welcome back to Smash Corner you all love and know, where today we have a very special manifesto, to
commemorate a character with a sad portfolio. He is not loved enough by his father Nintendo.

onstantly for-
gotten and left
in his brother’s
shadow but still
fighter #09 in Ultimate:
green Mario. Enough
poetry and jokes, let’s
tackle honestly one of
my favourite fighters in
Smash: Luigi!
This tall green plumber
started off as the lesser
known twin of the Mario
Bros, originally appearing
to assist his brother. It
wasn’t until 2001, 20
years after the birth of the
Mario franchise that Luigi
became the cowardly hero
of his own game, Luigi’s
Mansion. And now,
Nintendo may roast him
all they want but he has
won the love of the com-
munity with his infamous
meme, Weegee.
There since the very
start of the Smash
Bros. franchise, Luigi’s
moveset has evolved with
his reputation throughout
the years. He started off
as a mere echo fighter of
Mario, but he is now so
much more. Luigi has
stayed a medium weight
close-combat brawler
with average speed, like
his brother. However,
his special attacks are
what make him… well…
special, by trading the
many tools Mario had for
actual attacks and unique
abilities.
At his core, Luigi is
very similar to Mario,
with his normal attacks the
heart of his kit. He throws
some decently quick
jabs and tilts, with some
moderately powerful
smash attacks. And again
the aerials are the most
important parts of the
moveset. All of them are
extremely quick with
minimal lag time, with
the forward-air being the
quickest. The up-air great
for juggling, back-air for
finishing, down-air for
spiking and neutral-air
for all-round attack. As
Jumpman’s brother, it’s in
the air where he shines.

may roast him
all they want
but he won
some of the
communities’
love with his
infamous
meme,
Weegee”
“If Luigi hits
the sweet spot
at the very
beginning of
this move, it
will hit the
opponent
critically and
kill them at
only 60%”
L u i g i , h o w e v e r ,
diverges from the path
set by Mario with his
specials. The neutral B
is not so unique, it is
a simple Fireball that
moves straight ahead and
can stagger opponents.
Luigi’s side-special is his
Green Missile, a charged
attack that makes him dive
forwards head-first into
his enemies. This should
be used mostly as a hori-
zontal recovery; however,
this attack also comes
with a surprise. Indeed, at
every use Green Missile
has a 1 in 10 chance of ex-
ploding, propelling Luigi
even further and faster.
This is a nice finisher for
any unsuspecting enemy,
but one has to count on
their luck for this to be the
case.
His up-special is the
Super Jump Punch, a
purely vertical recovery
move with a twist: if
Luigi hits the sweet spot
at the very beginning
of this move, it will hit
the opponent critically
and can kill an opponent
who is at 60%! To do so
Luigi must be facing the
enemy fighter, stand as
close as possible to them,
as he does his Super
Jump Punch. Beware,
however, both his up- and
side-special have a very
long lag-time so are easily
punished if you miss them.
For a safer attack, you
have his down-special, the
Luigi Cyclone, a spinning
attack with invincibility
frames at the start and
a generous hitbox and
knockback as opponents
get sucked in.
In addition to his
already very quirky
specials, Luigi has 2
other notable traits to top
the icing on the cake. He
is first of all the proud
owner of a ghost-sucking
vacuum cleaner, which
he uses as a tether grab.
However ridiculous it
may look, it is still an
incredibly useful attribute
to grab opponents from a
safe distance.
And saving the best for
last, Luigi has a forbidden
technique call the Weegee
kick. A move so good that
it is banned from online
play: his down-taunt.
That’s right, Luigi is the
only character to have a
taunt that actually does
something; it does only
2.4% damage but it spikes!
It is immensely difficult
to pull off as the timing
has to be just right but if
you manage to 2-frame
an enemy as they recover
with the Weegee kick,
you’ll have an extremely
satisfying kill. Sadly,
Thanks to Nintendo’s
‘No Fun Allowed Online’
rule, this secret technique
is banned in quickplay as
all taunts are disabled, so
you’ll have to invite your
friends over or create an
arena to humiliate them
personally.
Despite all his funny
moves and specials, it is
crucialto keep in mind that
Luigi is first and foremost
a combo character. In
order to win, you will
need to abuse the speed
of your aerials to chain
attacks on your opponent
without allowing them
to fight back in. In par-
ticular, the down-aerial
should be used at the end
of every aerial play to
spike the enemy fighter
on the stage, leaving you
more time to land, follow
up with another attack,
to ultimately keep the
combo going. Once they
have enough percentage,
you can finish them off
with one of your specials,
smash attacks, or throws.
Once you have mastered
the Weegee, you will be
able to pull off some zero
to death combos (check
out the great video from
Beefy Smash Doods for
more details on “Luigi’s
Insane Combo Game”).
Overall, Luigi is
a mid-tier character
because his attacks seem
to be designed to be funny
rather than reliable. This
green plumber still poses
a great threat thanks to his
great combo potential, his
quirky specials and tech-
niques are just an added

bonus to enjoy. So even
if he sometimes feels like
Nintendo’s biggest joke, I
highly suggest you try him
out and give him the love
he deserves. However, he
might soon be dethroned
as the king of memes in
the Smash games by a
rumoured DLC fighter
also in the Mario Bros.
franchise: Purple Luigi...
