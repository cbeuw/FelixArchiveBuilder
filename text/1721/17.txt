S
tudents have risen
up in arms against
the Union after it
was discovered
that its flagship radio sta-
tion played the same song
on repeat for the past 12
years without detection.
Sources tell NegaFelix
the scandal was uncovered
by a final year Aeronauti-
cal Engineering student,
Carlos Guantanamera,
during a late-night study
session.
“I can only work to
terrible music, so natu-
rally I thought IC Radio
would be the perfect
choice,” he said, speaking
to NegaFelix by e-mail,
for fear of losing his seat
in the library. “At first it
worked, but after 30 mins
of listening to Rihanna’s
‘Umbrella’ on repeat I
almost lost the will to live.
Not that I had that much
to begin with anyway.”

Overexposed, the online
Facebook forum, it was
found that this trend had
been ongoing for the past
decade without any con-
nection being made.
desk in late 2007. Rather
than raising the issue,
the committee decided
to simply profit off their
allocated Union grant,
spending the vast majority
on curly fries.
“I don’t see what the
problem is,” said Sandy
Djembe, Head of Pro-
gramming for IC Radio.
“Everyone’s complaining
now but it’s not like
anyone actually ever
listens in anyway.”
Monica Sarafellow,
Deputy President (Sign
Arts & Circuses), was
enraged at the revelation.
“For fuck’s sake, you
mean I didn’t have to
write all those damn Felix
articles? I could have just
had my own air time all
this time – it’s not like
anyone would have cared
either way!”
They actually have no idea what they’re doing //
