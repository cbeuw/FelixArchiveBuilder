Death of a Salesman Class
A

Death of a
S a l e s m a n
holds a place
in the western theatrical
collective consciousness
that is only occupied by
a few other plays. It’s
eternally performed,
eternally taught, eternally
lauded. A play one has
probably lied about seeing
at some point, not out of
some desire to impress,
but a sincere sense that
it’s always been there and
“of course I’ve seen it!”.
Such is it status that when
it’s listed to be performed
again, one doesn’t have a
sense of excitement but
rather a feeling we’re
going through the standard
rituals of theatre watch-
ing. But now I should be
emphatically clear, here at
the Young Vic this feeling
is completely blown away
– this is a production of
such power and talent
that a genuine sense of
gratitude and awe is being
excreted from each pore as
you stand to clap the cast
come the end of the near
three hour performance.
Wendell Pierce’s
performance as Willy
Loman is one that spans
time, we’re in 1949 with
him but also recognising
deeply modern themes
within ourselves. The
sense of great change in
the world around you that
seeps from the play is
transmitted wonderfully
from Pierce’s powerhouse
of a performance. Pierce
sets a bar that is high but
it is certainly met by his
cast members with Arinze
Kene as Biff Loman
and Martins Imhangbe
as Happy Loman also
putting in performances
of stupendous quality.
Kene’s writhing, seething
and pained demeanour
throughout conveys the
torment that is the essence
of Biff Loman’s sense
of wrong in the world.
Whereas Imhangbe
displays the dual con-
sciousness, the smile on
the troubled soul, the
blissful ignorance and
insidious committal to
the American dream that
underlines the Loman
family fate wonderfully.
The duo’s chemistry and
physicality mean you will
be hard pushed to find
a better pair of Loman
brothers on stage.
from the rural American
south to the industrialised
north. One can’t help but
having a nagging sense
the Loman fate is as much
a result of discrimination
as of their naive commit-
tal to America. A feeling
that is only exaggerated
when the successes of the
white Bernard (Ian Bonar)
and Howard Wagner
(Matthew Seadon-Young)
are made clear.
W
hat begins
as a simple
p a r -
ent-teacher
meeting between recently
separated Brian (Stephen
Jones) and Donna (Sarah
Morris), and teacher
Mr McAfferty (Will
O’Connell), to talk about
their son Jayden’s liter-
acy struggles in school,
spirals quickly as tension
bubbles about social and
cultural divides within
the classroom. Scenes
flicker between the
parent-teacher meeting,
and also student-teacher
after-school ‘homework
club’, as Morris and Jones
deftly switch between
playing Brian and Donna
to Jayden and classmate
Kaylie. Morris does a
particularly good job of
switching to an energetic
Kaylie at the drop of a hat,
really capturing the play-
fulness of a nine-year-old.
This play confidently
asks questions about the
complexities of a failing
education system. How
does a difficult domestic
situation affect important
decision-making for your
children? What decision is
‘right’ as a teacher when
school rules conflict with
personal ideologies of a
course of action? How
have both educators and
parent alike been jaded
by the education system?
Is it the children who ulti-
mately lose out amidst all
this power play between
parent and teacher?
There are no conclusive
answers, and we are left
feeling emotionally suck-
er-punched by the end.
down to, as well as
reminding Donna of her
own experiences being
let down by the education
system. They begin with
the thought that they don’t
want their child “going
through the rest of his
life thinking something
is wrong with him”, and
Mr McAfferty’s superflu-
ous, almost patronising,
language only exacerbates
their insecurities and
uncertainties.
Time is split between
moments of humour,
moments of discomfort,
and moments of hostility,
but they all piece together
well to tell an interesting
story. We never leave
the classroom, creating
a confined environment
for the escalating drama
and shock ending. The
characters are well-de-
veloped, particular Mr
McAfferty, and O’Con-
nell does a brilliant job
switching between the
soft-spoken personality
we see initially, his en-
thusiastic interaction with
the students, and his evo-
lution to condescension
towards the parents, then
aggressive, then regret-
ful. The scene switches
between parent-teacher
and student-teacher really
highlight the juxtapo-
sition between his two
‘personalities’ and how
he changes as the play
progresses.
My only criticism
would be that 95-minutes
seemed a little long, es-
pecially with no interval,
and although it didn’t
struggle to capture my at-
tention for the full length
of the play, it did move a
little slowly at points. But
stellar performances and
insightful subject matter
still make this play well
worth the watch.

Out of Water Avalanche: A Love Story
O
range Tree
Theatre, once
again, has a
stunning new
production running. This
touching play, written
by the remarkable Zoe
Cooper, spans themes of
gender identity, sexuality,
new environments, and
hardship. A delicately
written script, along with
circular staging and a trio
of talented performers,
made this a show to
remember.
The story follows mid-
dle-class Londoner Claire
(Lucy Briggs-Owen)
moving to her wife Kit’s
(Zoe West) north-eastern
coastal hometown, South
Shields, to have their
baby. As she starts her
new job in a school, she
encounters Fish (Tilda
Wickham), a gender-fluid
pupil who she begins to
mentor. The three actors
undertake more roles
than just this, and they
succinctly switch between
characters impressively.
West stood out to me
in this regard, slipping
between the charming and
confident Kit, curmudg-
eonly senior male teacher,
and underachieving,
chavvy teenage student,
with ease. I wish we had
seen more of Kit, and her
interactions with Claire –
it was quite focussed on
Claire (despite a brilliant
job by Briggs-Owen) and
her struggling to adapt
to her new environment,
but I’m guessing it was
meant to be this way. I
just really fell in love with
Kit’s boyish charm and
affection and wish she’d
been a bigger part of the
storyline. Wickham really
shone in their entrancing
monologue, lip-syncing
nature documentary
excepts and utilising fluid
hand movements to mimic
fish the subject matter.
where she doesn’t correct
them anymore, and also
with the disapproving
sneers towards affection
between her and her wife
by people in her new
environment, including
Kit’s own family.
H
ope springs
eternal; that is
both a blessing
and curse for
Julie Leigh’s protagonist,
the Woman (Maxine
Peake), in Avalanche:
A Love Story. We meet
Peake’s nameless
character at a psychic’s
gathering, which is really
something of a supernatu-
rally tinged group therapy
session. Everyone there
is seeking to let go of a
loved one; the Woman is
too, only her loved one,
a longed for child, has
never existed.
Peake commands the
vast Barbican stage mas-
terfully as she unspools
a winding, tragic tale
of loves lost and found.
Based on Leigh’s best-
selling memoirs, the story
is of a woman in her late
thirties who has found
moderate professional
success and is on the
cusp of greater acclaim
living a lonely existence
in New York. By chance
she meets her high-school
sweetheart; they rekindle
their past affair with
lustful passion, pledge to
be together always and
return home to Sydney to
marry and raise a family.
The optimism of the
couple’s early reunion
fizzles shortly and The
Woman’s life descends
slowly into a carousel
of clinic appointments,
anger and hopelessness in
which her world narrows
to her overwhelming
need for a child. If hope
is the catalyst that sparks
the story, power, or the
lack of it is the fuel on
which it propels itself.
In one telling scene, the
Woman’s husband, angry
that his wife has put
their strict baby-making
schedule on hold to direct
a movie threatens to leave
her, and propose they live
in separate houses whilst
staying married. She is hu-
miliated, but returns to his
bed that night to resume
trying for a baby. Peake
tells us of this episode
with a wry smile, devas-
tating her quiet sadness.
Later, after her sixth or
seventh cycle of IVF has
failed, The Woman is
persuaded by her doctor to
return just one more time
to a gruelling regime of
daily hormone injections
and endless visits to the
gynaecologists in the face
of ever lengthening odds
of success, it is a privilege
for which she’ll have to
pay $7000. As she leaves
the appointment, she
notices a Bentley in the
doctors’ parking space.
To hold an audience
captive for more than
an hour by oneself in a
theatre as huge as the
Barbican is no mean feat,
but Peake, under the direc-
tion of Anne Louise Sarks
manages it with ease. She
is wholly naturalistic as
she moves across the stage
as we see her unravel
from a woman sure of
herself to one undone by
wave after wave of loss.
As the play progresses
and the Woman comes to
be at peace with her child-
lessness, the stark white
walls of Marg Howell’s
set move in concert;
deconstructing the austere
confines of clinic to reveal
a desolate, but beautiful
wildness beyond.

“Layers of
thematic
depth”
The decision to cast the
Loman family as an Af-
rican-American one adds
layers of thematic depth
and evokes commentaries
not found in Miller’s
original script. The play’s
historical setting means it

Head over to Richmond to see a heartfelt, beautiful
exploration gender identity and sexuality on the stage.
“Refreshing”
Moments of comedy
are well-timed and ef-
fective, and moments of
tenderness or frustration
are articulated, or not
articulated perfectly. This
is something Cooper does
often – sentences are left
unfinished, particularly if
they refer to sexuality or
violence, yet the audience
knows exactly what to
‘fill the blank’ in with.
The singing by West and
Wickham between acts is
evocative, almost melan-
cholic.
I loved this, and simply
put, we need more plays
like this. With strong
performances and a
poignant script, you can’t
go wrong with this show,
and you have until June to
catch it at the Orange Tree
Theatre.
The sense of a shifting
reality around you that
underlies Miller’s piece,
is also nicely coupled with
the experience of a great
migration and you are
invited to see the world
through the eyes of those
who were experiencing
this new world. Beyond
the thematic exploration,
the other refreshing spin
that sticks in the mind are
the set pieces of physical
movement that allow us
to enter Willy Loman’s
troubled mind
Innovation is really at
the heart of what makes
this performance great.
Even if you have seen
Miller a dozen times
before I can assure there
is something here that you
can not afford to miss:
intelligent reinvention has
made Miller strike new
chords.
“They

It was refreshing to
see a play centred around
queer characters, espe-
cially a femme/soft butch
couple coping with soon-
to-be parenthood and a
new environment, which
provoked many thoughts
and insecurities in them.

breakingly

The final scenes, set in a
tundra that is both a snowy
oceanscape and the rubble
of the medical centre,
will be most affecting
for those with personal
history of fertility issues,
but still packs a punch for
those who don’t. in telling
her own very personal
journey with IVF, Leigh
has created a tale of ob-
session and grief that is
heartbreakingly universal.
