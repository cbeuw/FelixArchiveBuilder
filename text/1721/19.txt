O
ver the Early
May bank hol-
iday weekend
whilst stu-
dents across the nation
were locked indoors
studying hard for exams,
the country’s finest stu-
dent athletes gathered
at Bedford’s premium
track for an ultimate
athletics showdown.
The weekend began
with heats on Saturday,
with former-Club
Captain Alex Mundell
taking on the 800m.
With the top 3 in each
heat to qualify for the
semi-finals, Mundell
battled her way to a
comfortable qualifica-
tion, finishing second in
her heat with a time of
2:23.73.
In the 1500m, Niki
Faulkner ran well in
a tough heat finishing
with 4:05.72. Two heats
later, James Millett went
a tad quicker at 4:05.08,
and although the boys
narrowly missed out on
qualification, they still
finished in the top 30.
In the spectator-fa-
vourite 3000m Steeple-
chase, Oliver Newton
made it over the 37
hurdles and ran his first
sub-10 to qualify as one
of the “fastest losers” in
a time of 9:55.60.
In Sunday’s action,
Idan Gal-Shohet was
up in the long jump,
leaping to a respectable
22nd place with a best
jump of 6.23m.
formances in the men’s
5000m with Daniel
Mulryan finishing 13th
in 14:51.24 after taking
the lead early on, closely
followed in 14th by
fresher Oliver Barbaresi
who ran a track personal
best of 14:52.01, a fan-
tastic run after coming
back from injury.
Their times differed
by less than a second
despite running in dif-
ferent heats, with the
second heat significant-
ly faster than the first.
Club Captain-elect
and lycra-lover Henry
Hart also ran a promis-
ing time.
In the 3000m Stee-
plechase final, Oliver
Newton returned to beat
the personal best he set
the day before to run
9:54.03 and finish 13th
overall.
London spectated via
an infamous livestream.
The race began tenta-
tively before quickly
picking up, spreading
the field out into a lead
group of 8. then 5. then

Chattenton managed
to keep the pace with
the leaders right up to
the final lap, finishing
4th in a huge personal
best of 16:08.53, and
a massive 13 seconds
ahead of 5th place.
Overall the weekend
was a roaring success,
offering a taste of the
sort of performances we
can expect to see from
Imperial’s athletes later
in the season.
