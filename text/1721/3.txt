The Green New Deal: the less realistic the
better
While the current plan has been defeated by the Republican controlled Senate, it is still very
much needed in its curent form to successfully tackle the worst aspects of climate change.

A
revolutionary
set of policies
called the New
Deal was enact-
ed by Franklin Roosevelt,
in response to the Great
Depression. The policies
were incredibly success-
ful in providing economic
relief and financial reform
through public work
projects, laying the foun-
dation for the upcoming
era of Democratic Party
majority in Congress; in
essence, it upheld the idea
that real freedom can only
be achieved with econom-
ic security.
The Green New Deal
(GND) is a 21st
Century
remake of these princi-
ples; it couples the aim
of sweeping socioeco-
nomic reform with the
most urgent crisis of
modern day: curbing our
carbon footprint to avoid
irreparable damage to
the Earth.
The idea that these
two aims could be
tackled in a single effort
was first conceived in
2007 in the UK, in cus-
tomary British fashion
– in a pub. It was
around the time of the
global financial crash,
and economists Larry
Elliot and Colin Hines
conjectured that a set of
trailblazing policies like
the New Deal would be
needed to fix the state of
the world. It came close
to entering mainstream
politics in both the US
and UK, supported by
both Gordon Brown and
Barack Obama, but did
not gain enough traction
for it to be officially
supported by either es-
tablishment. Then, when
Labour lost government
in 2009 and when the
Democrats lost hold
of Congress in 2010,
the discussion of it in
politics virtually disap-
peared, especially for
the UK, where a decade
of austerity (which is
the antithesis of what
the GND stands for)
would soon begin. Most
recently it was brought
back into public atten-
tion by US House Rep-
resentative Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez (AOC)
and Senator Ed Markey.
The GND Deal
proposed by AOC and
Markey, however, has
evolved immeasura-
bly from the original
proposed in 2007. The
document itself is a list
of goals, collectively
called the “Green New
Deal”, that they hope the
government will orient
future policies towards.
These goals includes:
• Reducing the net
emission of greenhouse
gas to zero;
• 100% reliance
on clean, renewable
energy to supply all of
US’ electricity;
• S w i t c h i n g
the auto industry to
zero-emission electric
vehicles;
• A d d r e s s i n g
historical and current
oppression of indig-
enous communities,
communities of color,
migrant communities,
deindustrialized com-
munities, depopulated
rural communities,
the poor, low-income
workers, women, the
elderly, the unhoused,
people with disabilities,
and youth;
• G u a r a n t e e i n g
employment with a
family-sustaining wage,
adequate family and
medical leave, paid va-
cations, and retirement
security
These goals, each
already bold and colossal
when viewed in isola-
tion, were condensed
into a single resolution,
with an aim of achieving
each one of them in 10
years’ time. It seemingly
tried to encompass any
imaginable problem
that any imaginable
US citizen may face; it
looks and sounds like a
theory of everything.
Unsurprisingly, it
became a popular target
for conservatives, who
argue that the Green
New Deal is more of
a socialist project that
wants to rid American
capitalism disguised as
a climate resolution.
The GND proposed by
AOC was a non-bind-
ing resolution, even if
the resolution receives
approval it does not
legally commit them to
these goals. But exactly
how the Deal should be
interpreted, as a mani-
festo of what progres-
sives hope to achieve or
as a legitimate proposal
for future legislation,
seemed ambiguous to
the public and even to
politicians themselves.
Despite the impres-
sion of failure the
numbers may give,
beneath the ostensible
numbers the Green New
Deal is considered as far
from defeat as we are
from Andromeda. The
strategic logic of the
GND reveals the hidden
brilliance of it, and helps
us understand the Senate
vote, or any future vote
on it, is not a proper
measure of its success.
It is the epitome of bad
policy but good politics.
Its success can be
seen through the rapid
bandwagon effect of
major 2020 Democratic
presidential candidates
endorsing, and some
even co-sponsoring, the
deal. It succeeded in
bringing climate change
to the political calculus,
an issue that both parties
will now consider as in-
dispensable when trying
to win over millennials.
The Democratic Party
in past years has tried
unsuccessfully to bring
climate change to the
table in an inside-out
approach. Their attempt
to spread the message
through business
leaders and centris
failed because of the
diminishing existence of
moderate Republicans,
something that drove
the Democratic Party
to water down their
proposals. The logic
of the GND was to do
the opposite, to break
the gridlock from the
outside in, and gain po-
litical attention through
an unyielding grass
roots movement run by
the youth.
The American politi-
cal system has long been
under gridlock – passing
new legislation, no
matter how incremental
the change proposed, is
challenging. Faced with
a predicament where
the default change is no
change at all, and given
the urgency and gravity
of climate change, only
a resolution as overam-
bitious as the proposed
GMZ can disrupt the
current balance of
power. The goals of the
deal may be far-fetched
and improbable, but
there’s nothing to lose
when the only alterna-
tive is nothing.
But the incorpora-
tion of socioeconomic
reform for a movement
focused primarily in
climate change is not
just for flair, it is nec-
essary. When proposing
a complete overhaul
of industries and a
thorough transformation
of the energy economy,
the financial securities
and lifestyles of citizens
must be guaranteed for
them to trust the gov-
ernment enough to make
the change.
Though the GND
seems to have as many
facets as there are 2020
Democratic presidential
candidates, it can be
invariably agreed that
its overarching effect
has been a delineation
of what a modern pro-
gressive would likely
demand. It seems to be
more like a manifesto, a
grand mission statement
for what values the
progressive left want to
construct their society
around.

“The idea that

Senator Mitch Mc-
Connell, the leader
of Republicans in the
Senate and a wily polit-
ical operator, seized on
this uncertainty and sug-
gested that the Senate
will settle the issue
through a vote, which
would force Democratic
senators into a binary
choice of ‘Yes’ or ‘No’
that do not consider the
different ways the Deal
can be interpreted. To
avoid this, the leading
Democratic Senator
Chuck Schumer advised
Democratic senators
to abstain from voting,
resulting in a 57-0 result
(where 57 voted against
the bill) from a house of
100 senators.
