issues around photography of the disenfranchised and mentally ill

T
here is the usual
muttering of
visitors who
have brought the
energy of the streets into
the solemn exhibition.
Long lines of guests
shuffle their feet between
photos, some craning their
necks in myopic fascina-
tion at the monochrome
photographs of Sir Don
McCullin. Eventually, the
crowds thin out as people
gravitate towards the
centre of the exhibition,
pondering human barbar-
ity and how many more
photographs they can
handle.
Behind the closed
doors of the exhibition is
a world apart, one littered
with hauntingly graphic
photos that tear each
visitor from their comfort
zone. Here, the famous
image of an American
soldier, stationed in
Vietnam, staring out at
the audience. Shell-shock,
PTSD, whatever you
want to call it - nothing
does justice to the terrors
that ripple across his jet-
black pupils. Or the dead
Congolese fighter, face
torn apart by the path of
a bullet. Almost more
painful than the content
is the knowledge that
these conflicts, and the
many others exhibited,
are not just confined to
history. Disfigured child
victims of Agent Orange,
a carcinogenic pesticide
the Americans sprayed
on Vietnam’s leafy land-
scape, or the traumatised
ex-child soldiers on the
streets of Brazzaville,
Congo, are a stark
reminder that suffering
escapes the crystallised
moment one finds within
the frame.
Amongst the tropical
warfare and devastation
are close-up portraits of
some residents of the
East End. Homeless, de-
jectedly poor, often Irish,
these were the people
who lived on the streets
of Shoreditch well before
gentrification drove itin-
erants to other parts of the
city. The subjects of the
photographs include Jean,
a woman of indeterminate
age but all-too-familiar
circumstance. It was in the
pictures of her, as much
as the ones of overseas
conflict, that one can
appreciate what French
semiotician and theorist
Roland Barthes described
so accurately when he saw
the camera as a potent tool
in making the “invisible,
visible”. Her face, etched
with the wrinkles and
lines of a life of hardship,
are more than physical
signs of age. In another
photo, she squats with her
head in her hands. This is
the existential paralysis of
poverty in action, leaving
the vulnerable to suffer
their wretched plight. That
this perennial problem
exists in a frame in one of
London’s top galleries is
testament to McCullin’s
ability to straddle aesthet-
ics and empowerment.
Whether the audience can
only contemplate such
injustice through art is a
question that lingers well
after you leave.
The intertwined history
of photography and
mental illness reaches
far before McCullin took
to the streets of the East
End. During the mid-19th
century, psychiatrist and
amateur photographer Dr
Hugh Welch Diamond
took to photographing the
residents of the Surrey
County Asylum. The
photographs carry a con-
sistent style: the subject
is seated, wearing clean
and formal clothing, face
turned to the lens. While
McCullin’s photographs
are intentionally mono-
chromatic, Diamond was
more restricted by the
technology of the time.
In fact, William Henry
Fox Talbot had only in-
troduced photography to
British society 3 months
prior to Diamond’s first
photograph. Whether
through the sheer passage
of time, or an indifference
to the identity of the sitter,
most of those in the frame
remain anonymous. The
sepia-toned portrait to the
left shows one such name-
less subject. Captured in
1855 (towards the end
of Diamond’s photogra-
phy career), this simple
photo bears a remarkable
similarity to that of Jean,
despite over a century
separating these two
women. The dishevelled
hair, the head tilted know-
ingly, the weathered face.
Yet the formal clothing of
the anonymous lady, the
drapes in the background,
and the posture all betray
any sense of authenticity.
This woman’s photograph
was as much defined by
what was being thought,
and organised, behind the
lens, as the mood captured
by her expression. Jean,
by comparison, casually
holds a cigarette and
seems mid-speech. But
how did the mentally ill
go from detained to des-
titute? To understand this,
we have to briefly witness
the death of one of Eng-
land’s most controversial
institutions: the asylum.
In 1962, UK Health
Secretary Enoch Powell
(of ‘Rivers of Blood’
infamy) announced the
Hospital Plan, an effort
to move patients with
mental health conditions
from the confines of the
asylum to the care of
the community. Histo-
rians saw the move as a
concession to increasing
patient rights’ advocacy, a
pro-austerity government,
and an attempt to redress
the abuses which took
place within the asylum
walls. The latter reason
stands out as a fascinating
example of how British
radicalism and reform-
ism joined forces in the
18th and 19th century to
counter the profiteering
and widescale abuse of
vulnerable patients. For
some, the demise of the
asylum was celebrated
as an existential victory.
Counter-culture theorists
like Michel Foucault and
Erving Goffman saw
the asylum as a place
of oppressive doctrine
or identity-stripping,
respectively. One Flew
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,
Ken Kesey’s 1962 mas-
terpiece novel, pitted the
imprisoned and oppressed
residents of an asylum
against the authoritarian
dictatorship of the medical
establishment. In an effort
to critique the carceral
nature of the asylum, the
so-called anti-psychiatry
movement of the 1960s
and 70s hastened its over-
throw, but with no safety
net for transition into
better mental healthcare
services. This deinstitu-
tionalisation, which ulti-
mately led to the struggle
that community mental
health services continue
with to this day, left many
of the most vulnerable to
the cruelty of the streets.
In 2014, 45% of the
homeless population of
the UK had a diagnosed
mental health condition.
From the ruins of the
asylum came a new era of
suffering.
In examining the
striking images of the
mentally ill, viewers may
wonder why the photogra-
phers reached for the lens
in response to the suffer-
ing which they witnessed.
Diamond sought to use
photography for science,
to bring madness within
the realm of rationalism.A
proponent of the pseudo-
science of physiognomy,
he believed that mental
illnesses carried external,
visible physical stigmata.
Thus, a photograph was
an important resource in
diagnosis. Going further,
Diamond also suggested
that allowing a patient to
see their current disposi-
tion may spur them into
recovery. Beliefs fit for
his time, perhaps, but ones
that haven’t withstood the
test of time. For McCullin,
“the real truth of life is on
the streets.” He strived
to “photograph the daily
lives of people, and how
they exist, and how they
fight for space and time
and pleasure.” He was an
advocate for the welfare
of others, eager to bring
the suffering of those
abroad to the attention
to Britain. Yet with this
exposure to suffering and
injustice came a sense
of guilt. He has since
turned to landscape art,
“sentencing myself to
peace”. How much peace
he’ll find after years of
covering atrocities, I do
not know.
What of the subjects
of the photos? Are they
simply passive sitters (or
squatters), to be stared
at by Victorian medical
staff or photography fans?
The issue of consent,
already fraught in the
medical sphere, spills
over into the arts. As
controversial science
writer Alice Dreger feared
in her engagement with
intersex persons, the act
of photographing the
Other risks ‘othering’
them further, even if
the desire is to provide
agency and empowerment
to the disenfranchised.
So, was Jean capable of
understanding that her
photo was being taken,
that it had an agenda, and
that people may pay up
to £18 (eye-watering by
her standards, I imagine)
to navel-gaze before
her photograph? From a
history of oppression, ex-
ploitation, and stigma, do
those with mental illness
have a right to reclaim
the frame, and thus their
narrative?
