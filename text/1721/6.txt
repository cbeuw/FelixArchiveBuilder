Mycoprotein: a potential beneficial food for people
with type 2 diabetes?
SCIENCE
Anna Cherta-

f I were to ask you
the first thing that
comes to mind when
you think of fungi,
you would probably say
mouldy walls, gone-off
food, or athlete’s foot. The
Fungi kingdom is often
not viewed in a positive
light. However, we owe a
lot to fungi; they produce
life-saving antibiotics,
have allowed organ trans-
plantations in humans and
can recycle many types
of waste. In the area of
nutrition, some fungi
also have the potential to
affect human health in a
beneficial way, although
little research has been
devoted to it compared
to other foods. In the
Nutrition Section of the
Department of Medicine
at Imperial College
London, we are putting
fungi into the limelight
and studying the impact of
a particular type of fungus
on blood sugar levels and
appetite in South Asian
and European people with
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).
The Problem
1 out of 20 people
worldwide has T2D,
with South Asians being
more prone to the disease
compared to Europeans.
People with T2D have
higher blood sugar levels
than normal, which over
time can increase the
chances of developing
long-term complications
such as blindness, kidney
disease and heart failure.
It is therefore important
to manage blood sugar
levels in people with
T2D in order to keep
blood sugar in the normal
range. The first-line
strategy to achieve this
is by improving dietary
intake. Healthy, balanced
diets are generally char-
acterised as being high in
dietary fibre and protein,
which decrease both blood
sugar levels and appetite.
If blood sugar levels are
reduced toward normal
levels, the chances of
having T2D-related com-
plications are reduced.
Likewise, if appetite is
decreased, intake of ener-
gy-rich foods will likely
also decrease, helping
to reduce body weight,
which is a key risk factor
for T2D. However, an
ongoing problem with
healthy diets is that they
are not suitable for all
cultures and most of the
research around them has
been conducted in people
of European origin, there-
fore not being applicable
to South Asians. Further-
more, people often find it
difficult to stick to these
diets.
The Potential Solu-
“Diet is a
cheaper tool to
manage blood
sugar than
diabetic drugs”
“1 out of

Diabetes, with
South Asians

Europeans ”
is low in fat and calories
and high in both dietary
fibre and protein.
Mycoprotein is com-
mercially available across
Europe, North America
and Asia under the brand
name of “Quorn”, which
makes it suitable and ac-
cessible to many cultures.
In addition, mycoprotein’s
appearance and texture
has been shown to be very
similar to animal-derived
meat as both microscop-
ic structures are very
similar, with the excep-
tion that mycoprotein’s
structure is surrounded
by fibre (Figure 1). Pro-
fessor Gary Frost, head
of the Nutrition Section at
Imperial College London,
said: “Mycoprotein has a
unique food matrix, which
may act as a barrier for
sugar absorption during
digestion, therefore im-
proving sugar levels in
blood.”
Since mycoprotein is
high in both dietary fibre
and protein, suitable for
all cultures, widely availa-
ble and has a similar taste
to meat, we believe that
it could be an effective
food for regulating blood
sugar levels and appetite
in people with T2D.
The question
We have previously
shown that mycoprotein
has a positive effect on
blood sugar levels and
appetite in healthy people
who do not have T2D,
but little is known about
this effect in people with
T2D from South Asian
and European ancestry. It
is for this reason that we
are investigating whether
mycoprotein alone, or in
combination with another
fibre called guar gum, is
able to reduce blood sugar
levels and appetite in both
ethnic groups. Professor
GaryFrostadded:“Instead
of testing a sole food, we
are testing what a usual
meal would be, such as
mince mycoprotein with
rice accompanied by a
chapatti bread. This bread
has guar gum incorpo-
rated into the dough. We
think that, by combining
both types of fibre (myco-
protein and guar gum), an
additive effect in lowering
blood sugar levels could
occur in people with T2D,
regardless of their ethnic-
ity.”
Why is this impor-

One food that is high
in both dietary fibre and
protein is mycoprotein.
Mycoprotein is the name
given to the biomass of a
fungus called Fusarium
venenatum. Mycoprotein

This research will help
us understand how blood
sugar responses differ
between South Asian and
European people with
T2D, and will also high-
light the importance of
tailoring diets according
to cultural background.
This is important because
diet is a cheaper tool to
manage blood sugar than
diabetic drugs and could,
therefore, be of great
benefit to health care
systems, especially those
based in lower-income
regions found in parts of
South Asia.
this research?
Yes you can! The Nu-
trition Section is currently
looking for volunteers
for a nutritional research
study looking at the
effect of mycoprotein on
blood sugar levels and
appetite in South Asian
and European people with
T2D. To be suitable to
participate, you have to
have T2D, not be taking
insulin and be from either
South Asian (Afghani-
stan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Maldives, Nepal, India,
Iran, Pakistan, Sri Lanka)
or European ancestry.
Participants will be asked
to attend the Imperial
Clinical Research Facility
at Hammersmith Hospital
for six separate study
visits, which are five
hours long approximately,
during which you will be
asked to consume a meal
within 15 minutes, have
blood taken and consume
a buffet meal. Expenses
will be paid. If interested,
please contact protein@
