INALA – Abundance of goodwill
I
NALA is a fusion
dance performance
of Zulu ballet set
to Zulu songs sung
by the Soweto Gospel
Choir, accompanied by
western instrumentation.
It celebrates the value of
community and even the
most mundane activities
from the passage of life.
Choreographed by Mark
Baldwin, the show is about
unity in diversity, accept-
ance and the highs and
lows of life. The show is
performed by two distinct
groups: the dancers and
the choir, but throughout
the show they interact and
share the space together.
A life-affirming show,
INALA transcends cultural
boundaries, especially
relevant to our uncertain
future with Brexit.
If one word could
describe the show, it
would be heart-warming.
But also uplifting. And
hopeful. The choir and
dancers all perform with
wide, happy smiles,
noticeably Ashley Wilson
(dancer). The choir fre-
quently breaks down into
steps which looked like
freestyle dancing, their
movements seemingly
effortless and enjoyable.
The casts’ enthusiasm is
contagious, so much that
I could see members of
the audience tapping their
knees with the beat, with
me too wanted to get up
and join the singing and
dancing.
Despite all the songs
sung in Zulu, the audience
was able to connect
with the themes by the
exaggerated movements,
expressions, music and
background. Homesick-
ness, joy of coming back
home and accepting
those who’ve left were
the subjects of the dance.
Being an international
student, I could relate to
these sentiments (exam
season being a particu-
larly difficult time of the
year for all of us).
the show in Holborn, it
is safe to assume that the
majority of the audience
did not understand the
Zulu lyrics, but nonethe-
less, the philosophy of
cross-cultural collabo-
ration through the arts,
and unity was effectively
delivered and appreciated
by the viewers.
As the sun rose and
set, and the city scape
expanded, I was transport-
ed from urban London to
the vast plateaus of South
Africa closely bonded to
nature. Natural sounds
of crickets, wind and the
typical drums helped this,
the atmosphere seemed
genuine. Costumes com-
pounded the authenticity
of the show, whether
this be by the traditional
kurtas of the choir or the
tribal skirts with animal-
istic head gear worn by
the dancers. The curled
spines, stiff crawling
movements coupled with
elegant pirouettes came
together in a beautiful
amalgamation of cultures
and styles (in particular
ballet and contemporary
dance), making this show
such a unique and beauti-
ful sight.
What was especially
beautiful about the show
was how it celebrated
non-conformity and di-
versity by incorporating a
diverse cast. Each dancer
is of different built and
dancing background.
Unlike the original
Ladysmith Black Mam-
bazo’s music to INALA,
the Soweto gospel choir
adds female singers to the
choir, expanding the vocal
textures and bringing
more breadth of newness.
Coordination was incon-
sequential even in group
numbers, evident from the
aforementioned improvi-
sations. Clearly set apart,
the choir and dancers
had their own numbers,
but they shared the same
space, one group setting
up the scene for the next
(dancers literally moving
stumps for the choir to
sit on and the choir in
turn sharing umbrellas or
seats with them). This co-
existence was beautifully
balanced with song and
dance.
Although the show
honoured the free spirit
and celebrated individ-
uality, aspects of group
performances lacked
coordination, and were
performed half-heartedly
despite the otherwise aura
of merriment. There was
a certain disorganisation
as dancers and the choir
shuffled onto the stage
towards the end of the
first act, the artists seemed
to tire. Nevertheless, the
tirelessness was managed
by the impetus of the
second act, tugging at
heartstrings.
Dance and song combine in this heart-warming homage to individuality.

Other than the admin-
istrative announcements,
the only other use of
English was a line
sung by the choir: hello
trouble, bye-bye trouble,
I am going somewhere.
The resolve with which it
was delivered made this a
non-negotiable reality and
was greatly inspiring. And
believe me, the audience
watched on silently with
bated breath. Watching
Despite the miniscule
shortcomings of the
performance I thoroughly
enjoyed the show and
highly recommend it to all.
For all it’s worth, INALA
provides a much-needed
break from the humdrum
of daily life and brings
a burst of cheerful (yet
composed) energy. And
its 100-minute run time
is great for a quick exam
destress session too!
