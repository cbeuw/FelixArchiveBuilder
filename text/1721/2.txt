2019 Student Aca-
demic Choice Awards
(SACAs).
The award ceremony,
which was first launched
in 2012 to provide stu-
dents the opportunity to
recognise, reward and cel-
ebrate excellence amongst
College staff, received
over 1500 nominations. In
February, student panels
met to review the nomi-
nations, select a shortlist
of 48 members of staff
and, ultimately, choose
the winners (a full list of
which can be seen below).
This year's ceremony
saw changes to the usual
proceedings, as three
new categories were
introduced. These catego-
ries were:
Diversity & Inclusion
Champion - to reward
"staff who go above and
beyond what is expected
by actively tackling any
prejudice or barriers to
give all students equal op-
portunities, ensuring that
all students are engaged,
represented and that their
feedback is acted upon,
and harnessing the diver-
sity of the student body to
create a better experience
for everyone."
Communities Champi-
on - to reward "staff who
are proactive in enhancing
the experience of their
students by establishing
creative ways of bringing
together staff-student
communities, organising
initiatives, events or
projects that enhance the
community’s experience,
and creating opportunities
for the community to
collaborate."
Student Wellbeing
Champion - to reward
"staff who are proactive
in enhancing the wellbe-
ing of their students by
making student wellbeing
a clear priority, being pro-
active in their approach to
tackle wellbeing issues,
and providing effective
advice, support and guid-
ance to help students take
care of themselves."

Mental Health Awareness Week
T
his has not been
a good week for
the paper. The
Summer term
exam season has ravaged
the Felix team and, un-
fortunately, left us with
a second week of what
can only be described as
a somewhat streamlined
issue of Felix. I have to
apologise for dropping
the ball - my lack of
forward planning has
finally caught up to
me and, as a result, the
News section has taken
a serious hit. If it weren't
for a late anonymous tip,
we wouldn't even have a
cover story this week. I
had initially planned an
in-depth follow-up to
my predecessor, Fred's,
report on the state of
Imperial's Counselling
Service. It would have
been perfect timing,
with this week being
Mental Health Aware-
ness Week and almost
one year to the day since
Fred's original article.
However, largely due to
my lack of foresight, it
didn't occur to me that
the Counselling Service
might be overwhelmed
at a time like this and
would be unable to
speak to me. Apologies.
My error does bring up
an important point that I'd
like to raise.When inform-
ing a member of the Felix
team that this week is
Mental Health Awareness
Week, I was met with the
response, "I thought that
was every week", and it
got me thinking. Although
it is significant to have
weeks like this to high-
light an issue as important
as mental health, it is also
2
important to remember
that the work does not stop
once this week is over. It
is important for all of us to
remain mindful of mental
health - our own and that
of others. It is especially
important to continue to
consider those struggling
with mental health. Please
bear that in mind when
you eventually see my
follow-up article (in two
weeks or so).
In other news, this
week sees the much
anticipated return of the
Felix Sex Survey - head
to bit.ly/felixsexsurvey to
complete it!
This week's Felix issue
also sees the resurgence
of the Comment section
and something of a take-
over by Copy Editor Izzy
Zhang, who has a double
page Politics x Comment
spread. A massive shout-
out is in order!
Section of the Week for
this week is a tough one.
Naturally, the Arts section
has carried the paper
once again. However,
the Comment section
deserves some accolades.
Like a phoenix, it has risen
from the ashes to swoop in
and snatch section of the
week. Congratulations!
Finally, a reminder to
vote in Thursday's EU
elections. The importance
of voting can't be stressed
enough - the more young
people vote, the better for
democracy.
This might be the first
Editorial that I've actually
said something meaning-
ful and not waffled for
a page - please give it a
read.

2019 SACAs Winners // Imperial College Union
The SACAs cover all
faculties, departments
and campuses, as well
as all modes of study
- undergraduate, taught
postgraduate and doctoral
research. The awards
represent an opportunity
for students to show
staff that the work that is
being done to improve the
student experience is ap-
preciated and is not going
unnoticed. Each nominee
is sent an invite to the cer-
emony, and a certificate.
Perhaps more importantly,
each nominee is sent a
SACAs mug - famous and
highly sought after by all.
Congratulations to all
nominated and shortlisted
staff members.
all questions and answers
on the exam paper had
been accidentally given to
students prior to the exam.
The Business School and
Registry have taken this
very seriously. Multiple
options were considered
to ensure that the learning
outcomes of the module
are assessed as intended.
For this reason, a new
exam has been set for 17th
May, 10am - 12pm."
This decision has
reportedly not gone down
well with the cohort and
has been described by
some as "simply unac-
ceptable". An anonymous
student told Felix: "None
of the cohort like this
option. Our voices are not
being heard or considered
and we are suffering for
someone else's mistake."
In response to this
unfortunate situation,
Felix approached College
for comment. A state-
ment given by a College
spokesperson reads as
follows:
“A recent Corporate
Finance exam paper was
given to students in error
ahead of the assessment
instead of the planned
sample questions. We
aspire to the highest
academic standards for
our students and, while
errors like these are rare,
we take them extremely
seriously. To ensure that
the learning outcomes of
the module are assessed
fairly and as intended, a
new examination has been
scheduled for all students
for 17th
May. This date
was selected to minimise
impact on students’ other
work and assessments.
However we understand
that the rescheduling of
the exam is frustrating for
students and apologise for
the disruption at what we
know is already a stressful
time. The Business School
has been liaising closely
with the cohort to assist
any students experiencing
difficulties and is review-
ing its processes to ensure
that this does not happen
again. Anyone with
concerns should contact
Edgar Meyer, Associate
Dean of UG Programmes
and Education Quality:
e.meyer@imperial.ac.uk”
Students are said to
have proposed a 24-hour
“This is simply
unacceptable,
none of the
cohort like this
option”
coursework as an alterna-
tive to resitting the exam,
however this was to no
avail.
As of August 2019, the
fees for the MSc Climate
Change, Management
and Finance course are
£16,500 for EU students
and £28,300 for overseas
students.
