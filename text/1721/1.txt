students were left
reeling when it was
revealed to them that they
would have to resit an
exam due to an error.
The students, who orig-
inally sat the Corporate
Finance exam in Spring,
noticed a "huge mess up".
Speaking to Felix, an
MSc Climate Change,
Management and Finance
student in the Business
School, who has asked
to remain anonymous,
explained the situation:
"In our Corporate
Finance exam given by
[Associate Professor of
Finance] Dr. Claudia
Custodio, we were given
the exact same paper as
was previously released
to us under the premise
of a mock paper, prior
to the exam. Firstly, the
lecturer denied this and
said the exam we sat was
completely deliberate
and not a mistake. Then,
when other colleagues got
involved, they realised the
greater issue at hand."
The mistake was
immediately spotted by
the cohort of students
sitting the exam and it
was allegedly reported
to the invigilator within
ten minutes of the exam
starting. The invigilator
is said to have then con-
tacted the lecturer, who
was abroad at the time,
but was told that the exam
was fine. Subsequently,
the students were forced
to sit through the rest of
the two hour exam for no
apparent reason.

following:

you yesterday regarding

exam. As we explained,
