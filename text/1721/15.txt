nvestors are typically
faced with the ques-
tion of how much
a stock (equity) is
worth. To answer this
question, there are two
ways to value equities.
The first method involves
the use of ratios and
comparison with other
equities – relative val-
uation and the second
method involves the use
of Discounted Cash Flow
(DCF) valuation analysis
to work out the exact
fair value of a stock. In
brief, absolute valuation
anchors the evaluation of
the fair value of a stock
based on the earnings and
financial statements of a
corporation and utilises
a systematic approach of
DCF valuation based on
assumptions of the future
cash flow of a corporation.
Nevertheless, the as-
sumptions made for DCF
valuation acts as a limit-
ing factor in establishing
truly accurate results – it
demands clairvoyance to
postulate future earnings.
In this article, we will
be exploring the absolute
valuation method via the
means of DCF valuation
to create a financial model
to evaluate the fair value
of a stock. There are five
basic steps in creating a
financial model for DCF
valuations.
1. Estimating long-
term unlevered future
free cash flow based on
historical performances
2. Estimating the
discount rate – Weighted
Average Cost of Capital
(WACC)
3. Discounting the
long-term future free cash
flow using the WACC.
4. Finding out the
market capitalisation
of the corporation
Accounts Receivable +
Inventory – Accounts
Payable = Current Assets
(less cash) – Current
Liabilities (less debt)
The FCFF projections
are based on certain
assumptions and FCFF
projections in itself is
a large topic. FCFF
projection, in brief,
includes identifying
how the drivers of a
business and thereby
forecasting (typically
5 years into the future)
the revenue, expenses,
capital assets, capital
structure and terminal
value of the company.
Revenue projections
are typically based on
either growth-based or
driver based, typically
growth-based models
such as the perpetual
growth rate of 3% is
used for simplification.
Terminal value projection
is typically based on
either perpetual growth
rate approach (treating
it as a perpetuity) or the
exit multiple approach
(using EV/EBIDTA). For
the sake of simplification,
we will assume that FCFF
projections have been
worked out as shown
below, given the following
assumptions.
We will now focus
on the transactional CF
line which highlights the
FCFF for both the entry
and exit (terminal value)
and the other years of
projections.
Note: In reality, FCFF
projectionisacomplicated
topic that requires another
comprehensive article to
explain how to come up
with FCFF projections for
companies. We will cover
FCFF projections in future
articles on DCF valuation.
Moreover, you are able to
attain FCFF projections
via the Bloomberg
Terminal function – EE
(Earnings Estimate) & FA
CF (Cash Flow Analysis).
The Bloomberg
Terminal is a paid
subscription (available at
ICL Central Library):
Step 2. Estimating the
and tax-adjusted cost of
debt.
The cost of debt (Rd)
can be easily found by
finding the yield of the
corporate bond offered
by the corporation in
question. E.g. If the yield
of the corporate bond =
5.3% and the tax rate is
10%, the tax-adjusted cost
of debt = 4.77%.
The cost of equity (Re)
can be found by using
the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) – Formula
shown below – where the
cost of equity (Re) is equal
to the required return for
a security (kj). d in this
article.
by subtracting debt
(outstanding liabilities)
and adding cash (asset) on
hand.
5. Dividing the
market capitalisation by
the number of outstanding
shares to give the
estimated fair value of the
stock.
Now let us proceed
with the step-by-step
methodology.
Step 1. Estimating long-
term future unlevered
free cash flow based on
historical performances
In this step, this
typically requires an
investor to make certain
assumptions. For instance,
to estimate future cash
flow, we could assume
that a corporation grows
at a compounded annual
growth rate (CAGR) or a
perpetual growth rate of
3%. However, for a start-
up, such an assumption
may be inappropriate
and the assumptions
made by an analyst
is highly subjective.
Therein lies a caveat of
financial modelling, these
assumptions undermine
the accuracy of the
financial models.
Suppose, however
the estimated perpetual
growth rate is accurate.
Firstly, the cash flows we
are using are unlevered
Free Cash Flows (FCFF).
FCFF refers to the amount
of cash a company has to
reinvest in other activities
or the cash flow left-over
after funding growth
activities. Note: There are
other CF analysis methods
such as using levered FCF,
but the FCFF method is
more frequently used by
analyst.
Using the balance sheet
to calculate the FCFF:
Unlevered FCF =
EBIT (Earnings before
Interest & Taxes)*(1-Tax
Rate) + Depreciation &
Amortisation expense
– Capital Expenditure
– Increase in Non-Cash
Working Capital (NWC)

However, all the
parameters for CAPM
can be found via Yahoo!
Finance or through the
Bloomberg Terminal –
Command Line: WACC.
The cost of equity (Re)
can be found by using
the Capital Asset Pricing
Model (CAPM) – Formula
shown below – where the
cost of equity (Re) is equal
to the required return for a
security (kj). To minimise
the confusion, the CAPM
will not be covered in this
article. However, all the
parameters for CAPM
can be found via Yahoo!
Finance or through the
Bloomberg Terminal –
Command Line: WACC.
Step 3. Discounting the
long-term future free cash
flow using the WACC.
To understand the
concept of discounting
a cash flow, remember
this phrase “A dollar
today is worth more than
a dollar tomorrow”. Let
us illustrate this with
an example. Tim is an
investor who puts $1 in
his bank account with an
annual interest rate of 5%,
this implies that at the end
of the 1st year, Tim has
$1.05 and at the end of the
2nd year, Tim has $1.05 *
1.05 = $1.1025. At the end
of 2 years, the future value
of his initial investment =
$1.1025, but his initial
investment, termed as the
present value (PV) still
remains at $1, where PV =
$1.1025/1.052 = $1.
Similar to this idea, you
cannot simply compare
cash flows at a different
points of a timeline. $100
at the 0th year is worth
more than $100 in the
2nd year as you would be
forgoing interest earned in
2years.Hence,tocompare
cash flows at different
point in time, you would
have to discount the cash
flow by the interest rate
(the opportunity cost).
Hence, an extension of
this to the DCF formula
would be as follows,
where CF refers to the
free cash flow of the
corporation in the future
and r refers to the discount
rate given by the WACC.:
company’s FCF), you
would have to calculate
the Market Capitalisation,
from the Enterprise Value
results from your DCF
valuation of the projected
FCF of the company.
After adding the
Enterprise Value with the
Cash & Cash Equivalents
and subtracting total debt,
the final value would
yield the Equity Value/
Market Capitalisation of
the company.
Step 5. Dividing the
market capitalisation by
the number of outstanding
shares to give the
estimated fair value of the
stock.
The intrinsic market
capitalisation (the value
derived after subtracting
debt and cash from EV)
divided by the total
number of outstanding
shares (20,000 in this
example) would yield
the intrinsic value of per
share.
Assuming the current
market capitalisation of
the share (valued by the
market) is $500,000 and
the current price of the
share is $25.00, you can
see that the intrinsic value
of the equity value/share
is greater than the current
share price i.e. The share
is undervalued and may
be a good purchase.
Conclusion:
While DCF analysis
may seem like a powerful
tool (that can be easily
relied upon with the use of
the Bloomberg Terminal),
there lies multiple
disadvantageous of DCF
analysis. Firstly, share
prices reflect the market’s
sentiments towards the
corporation. In times of
low investor confidence
– Global Financial Crisis
08, Dotcom Bubble 2000s
–regardlessoftheintrinsic
value of the corporation,
investors would severely
undervalue corporations
in light of the poor market
outlook. Moreover,
DCF analysis is heavily
influenced by the WACC
– values which are
subjective in nature – for
instance, the systematic
risk (beta) can easily be
valued differently (e.g.
using a 5-year vs 10-year
outlook or using different
statistical approach).
Lastly, private equity
and start-ups (with their
financial statements being
unattainable) is a problem
which many analysts
would face. Predicting
the growth drivers and
finding accurate estimates
for FCFF is a Sisyphean
task, given the dynamic
nature of start-ups.
Nevertheless, DCF
analysis allows an analyst
to come up with a good
yardstick and estimate
of what a corporation
is valued at. It is the
tool of choice for both
investment bankers and
equity research analyst
alike.
Using the FCFF
projections listed under
the Transaction CF:
We can use excel to
calculate the discounted
cash flow, using the
formula XPNV, which
gives the discounted cash
flow figure i.e. Net Present
Value (NPV) of the overall
FCFF projections:
The NPV of this cash
flow figure would yield
the Enterprise Value (EV)
of the company.
Step 4. Finding out
the market capitalisation
of the corporation by
subtracting debt and
adding cash on hand.
Market Capitalisation =
Enterprise Value + Cash &
Cash Equivalents – Total
Debt
Given that the DCF
analysis yields the
Enterprise Value of the
company – measure of
a company’s total value.

value (based on the
