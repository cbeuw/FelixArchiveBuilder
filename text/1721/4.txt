Do you sometimes feel like you’re in China?
If only I spent as much time revising as I do writing Felix articles

o you some-
times feel
like you’re in
China? That’s
what Suburban Express,
a bus company based in
Illinois, promises their
customers will not feel
when on their buses.
The Urbana-Champaign
campus of the University
of Illinois (UIUC) has
drawn a surging popula-
tion of Chinese students
to the area, apparently
too many for the liking of
Suburban Express. They
sent out a mass marketing
email in December 2017
that had “Passengers like
you. You won’t feel like
you’re in China when
you’re on our buses.”
The company shut
down its operations last
week (7th
May); it has
a long history of racist
behaviour, and not just
against Chinese people.
All the same, it made
me want to reflect ob-
jectively on the general
perceptions people have
about overseas Chinese
students, in and out of
Imperial, and whether
or not these views
are justified. Mainly
because, although I was
born and raised in Hong
Kong, my parents were
born in China and so
my personal culture and
sense of identity has
elements of both.
Chinese students are
often seen as self-segre-
gating, and not making
an effort to intermingle
with the rest of the
student body. There is
an element of truth in
this, but it is certainly
not a conscious effort
by Chinese students
to avoid other races.
It is understandable
for people to get along
better with those similar
to them. China is
culturally and racially
homogenous; Chinese
children grow up around
others like them, and
the mixing of different
foreign cultures is not as
common as in Western
countries. There are
other cultural disparities
to consider: socialising
in Western culture often
involves alcohol, but
teenage culture in the
East is overall more con-
servative, and involves
much less casual con-
sumption of alcohol,
cigarettes, and drugs.
It’s probably easier to
feel socially accepted
around and easier to
build trust with people
from your country; there
is solace in finding a
group that you fit in
with, and because, on
first impression, it felt
easiest to find things
in common with your
co-nationals, you decide
to stick with them. Espe-
cially when English is a
second language; I can
imagine what a relief it
is to have conversations
that do not require
constant mental back-
and-forth translating.
Of course, this be-
haviour of homophily
(an internal preference
for people like you, in
terms of race or age or
profession etc) doesn’t
apply solely to Chinese
students. I find this to
be the crux of having a
diverse community. The
value of diversity comes
from having people with
unique backgrounds
and perspectives, and to
take advantage of such
a community would
require intermingling
of people who do not
have much in common.
However, without any
homophilicity, there are
fewer channels through
which people can
embrace their heritage,
and ultimately there is
a loss in the value of
having an international
community to begin
with.
Furthermore, while
you want to encourage
all students from all
countries to socialise
outside their co-national
circles, students from
countries with larger
cultural barriers will in-
evitably be less willing.
You cannot single out
the students of one race
as being more closed-off
when they face a bigger
challenge.
For a while, I assumed
that all international
students who decide
to study overseas must
want to experience
living away from home,
to meet people and visit
places that you other-
wise wouldn’t be able
to, and to learn from
everything a diverse
international community
has to offer. I realise this
isn’t always true. You
may come to Imperial
with the sole intention
of getting a degree, and
therefore socialising is
simply not as important.
Imperial is, primarily,
an institution built for
academic purposes - its
primary selling point is
its academic rigour (if
you wanted an easier
ride you’d be at UCL).

na...”// South China Morning Post
“What makes

prospects, and wouldn’t
it be even greater for our
collective student ex-
perience if one of these
other purposes were to
meet new, interesting
people from diverse
backgrounds? Having a
more cohesive student
body would certainly
make some decisions
easier for the Union;
how can they improve
the experience of the
typical Imperial student
when... there isn’t one?
In that case, how do we
bridge a cultural gap that
intimidates most from
even attempting to cross
it? Is it even possible,
or necessary, to force
positive interracial
relationships? Doesn’t
the individual have
the freedom to interact
and make friends with
whoever they want?
What we see is a sit-
uation that the College
cannot solely be relied
upon to improve; effort
from the student body
is overwhelmingly the
most effective solution.
Having different
types of friendships for
different functions is
necessary for healthy
social integration – a
close group of co-na-
tional friends with
whom you are culturally
compatible; friends
from the host country
(UK) can ease the ad-
justment of international
students to the host en-
vironment and culture;
friends from abroad can
increase cultural agility
and awareness of global
affairs of home students
without them having to
leave the country.
I read a study on how
the social experience in a
predominantly white US
university is impacted
by race, where non-
white students described
the challenge of “fitting
in to a White campus
and community without
becoming “White”. For
Imperial, where no race
majority exists (home
students make up less
than 50% of the student
body) it’s possible the
challenge faced by
students here is a fear
of losing their sense of
belonging to wherever
they come from.
Naturally, over time,
students will gradually
adopt a sense of be-
longing at Imperial. It’s
possible that creating a
non-judgemental, wel-
coming environment for
students to step into on
their first day will help.
While I understand in-
ternational students face
many hurdles in strug-
gling to find their place
in a new environment
(which also applies to
home students), I do
not think international
students should feel
that the language and
cultural barriers they
face are unbreakable;
they do not need to be
seen as unsurmountable.
Ultimately, there is
no need to become less
‘Chinese (or whatever
race)’ to build meaning-
ful, wholesome relation-
ships with people from
elsewhere. There is no
shame in speaking with
an accent, or in taking
a few more seconds to
find the vocabulary you
want to express yourself.
There’s no reason to
feel like you can’t in-
tegrate if you don’t get
dry British humour or
western pop-culture; you
shouldn’t feel awkward
asking what that strange
slang word was. What
makes diversity ful-
filling and enriching is
our cultural differences.
Embrace and contribute
to the vibrancy of this
diversity, share with us
the humour and slang of
your culture.
Even so, wouldn’t
it be better still if
students came here
with purposes beyond
merely advancing career
