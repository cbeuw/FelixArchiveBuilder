readers! We
are Sahir and
Tom, and over
the course of the next few
weeks we will be writing
regular articles about the
trials and tribulations of
creating a tech start-up.
You may ask why
we are doing this. We
currently have our own
app, Impromptu, in devel-
opment and we are really
excited to be launching
it to Imperial students
in two months time. As
Imperial alumni we seek
to inspire you budding
entrepreneurs to get your
ideas off the ground, and
we hope these articles
may address some of your
concerns.
We firmly believe that
you too can develop an
app if you put your mind
to it, and in a cost effec-
tive manner. We’ll cover
subjects including initial
brainstorming ideas, pro-
totyping and subsequent
development.
Following this first
series of articles, we will
then detail our own expe-
riences and cover every
element of our journey to
date (as well as our future
aims). This first article
looks into setting the right
framework. So, without
further ado....
Idea
Your idea is crucial. It
is important to think about
its context: many people
will probably have had
your idea before you! The
first step is what sets most
people apart i.e. taking
the initiative to realise
said idea. Walking away
from regular income and
giving up your free time
is a bridge too far for the
majority.
The most important
thing, however, is execu-
tion. There is always an
element of luck involved,
but how well you put
together your app (and the
business framework that
supports it) is ultimately
what will separate your
idea from others. Your
idea should have a USP
(Unique Selling Point),
or better yet, multiple
USPs. This does not mean
that your idea has to be
completely novel; it might
for example involve a
different business model
to competitors or be more
cost effective.
Also think about your
idea’s lifespan. Is it some-
thing you can envisage
being around 5 years in the
future? 10 years? Think
about how many apps
actually survive this long.
“Impromptu
will be
launching
to Imperial
students in
two months
time.”
Think about how your
app will have to evolve
to remain popular. Is your
target audience fickle? Do
they chop and change the
apps they use based on
fads? The answer to this
question will also help you
frame your ambitions and
decide whether you want
Team
Dealing with people
who compliment each
other’s personalities is im-
portant. There is enough
tension running a business
without having to deal
with massive clashes of
character. Having defined
roles is beneficial and
provides a strong base for
future growth. The prac-
tical reality however is
that in a start up with only
a few people, everyone
will be doing a bit of
everything unless they
have relevant expertise.
Differences of opinion are
inevitable; however it is
imperative to take stock
of what your user base
would want as opposed to
your own desires.
In practical terms, the
ideal team would probably
comprise a few people of
varying areas of expertise.
Having a computer and
a business/management
specialist would prove
invaluable. There have
been plenty of success
stories to the contrary
however and a grounding
in an analytical discipline
is hugely advantageous.
Structure
Apps being built in
the UK can adopt an ltd
(limited company) or llp
(limited liability partner-
ship) format. There are
lengthy articles online
which detail the differenc-
es between these and the
format you choose will be
dictated by the type of app
you are building and your
own personal criteria. If
you endeavour to scale
to a large organisation
that will infuse additional
managers and stakehold-
ers, it would be better to
form a limited company
from the offset. Alter-
natively, if you foresee
a smaller scale business
catering to a select or
niche area, llp would be a

better way to go. Getting
your company registered
is simple and there are
plenty of online solutions.
You can also employ an
accountant to this end. It
is unlikely that you will
have your own offices to
begin with, so have your
accountant act as your
registered postal address.
It is important to have a
formal address for third
parties to verify you are
a legitimate business. It
is not possible to register
for key components of
your app build without
this (SSL certificates for
example).
We will be back next
week to touch on the first
steps required to get your
idea off the ground.....
to persevere in building
a user base for long term
success or go for short
term reward.
