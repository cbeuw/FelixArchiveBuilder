IC Health Centre
With things settling in this term
and the end fast a p p r o a c h i n g , just a
few words a b o u t the Imperial C o l l e g e
Health Centre in Southside, South
Kensington. C h e c k out the w e b site
for information o n the services pro-
vided - www.ad.ic.ac.uk/healthcen-
tre. A recurrent p r o b l e m is the sur-
prisingly high n u m b e r of appoint-
ments m a d e by patients w h o then
choose, for whatever reason, not to
attend those appointments - a " n o -
s h o w " . C u r r e n t figures f r o m the
Health Centre suggest that since
D e c e m b e r 1 9 9 8 the a m o u n t of time
lostthrough " d i d not attend" appoint-
ments is approximately equivalent to
a full-time doctor working for eight
weeks at the Health Centre. This is
quite a significant a m o u n t of time. If
you have a n appointment a n d c a n -
not m a k e it, cancelling it frees that
time u p for other patients. There is n o
cancellation fee, there is n o recrimi-
nation for calling o r emailing them
n e e d t h e e x e m p t i o n certificates
a g a i n . . . l p h o n e registry a n d they
say " o n e w e e k , s t a n d a r d p r o c e -

m a g i c o n e w e e k w a s b r o k e n after
s o m e s h a r p w r a n g l i n g . Surely,
t h o u g h , t h e registry c o u l d a n d
s h o u l d have j u m p e d t o attention to
h e l p these guys - it shouldn't take
the U n i o n President getting vicious
to m a k e things h a p p e n in a n e m e r -
gency. If the guys h a d not c o m e t o
see m e , w o u l d Registry honestly
have let t h e m loose their stuff t o
the Bailiffs? It a p p e a r s s o ...
T h e n i m a g i n e that w h e n the
guys g o to Registry they c h a n g e
their tune a n d say t w o days but not
today. It is the o p i n i o n o f the R e g -
istry that other students, waiting f o r
s t a n d a r d p r o o f (which y o u have
m o n t h s t o supply) s h o u l d take

diate loss of their b e l o n g i n g s . They
c l a i m that there m a y b e p e o p l e

For the interest of the Registry staff,

I C H C patients, leading to a n even
better service. All students a n d staff
are potential patients so it is in all o u r
interests.
Groups operating on campuses.
University c a n b e a trying time.
Every year groups a n d organisations
target campuses across the country,
playing o n student's weaknesses to
e n c o u r a g e them to join in with their
activities. IC usually suffers less than
other colleges in London. However
students need to be vigilant a n d
aware. If a stranger a p p r o a c h e s you
o n c a m p u s offering friendship, sup-
port a n d help as long as you attend
a meeting of their g r o u p - D O N O T

another, pressure m a y b e applied,

Their offers are hollow a n d sustained
n o cases as urgent a s this at pres-
ent - in fact cases this urgent c o m e
up o n c e every 5 years. I a s k e d the
other Presidents o f U L U , s o m e f r o m

they a l l replied e m p h a t i c a l l y that

attendance c a n be d a m a g i n g to your
health a n d your finances. They offer
help under two guises: as self-help
groups o r under the false banner of
"religion". This is not true. M a n y reli-
gions are genuinely represented at
IC, via I C U clubs (for example C a t h
Soc o r Islamic Society) o r non-union
IC aligned groups (such as Christian
Union). T h e groups you should b e
wary of clearly d o not include these
or any of the other faiths which are
genuinely represented.
It is necessary to be very general
in d e s c r i b i n g such d a n g e r o u s
groups. That sounds a bit heavy.
Don't worry, these groups are few
a n d far between a n d it is rare that
you will b e stopped o n campus.
