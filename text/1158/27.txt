Pong (PSX)
A m I right in saying the original Pong was the first
g a m e t o use a g r a p h i c a l interface? M a y b e . A n y -
way, that g a m e (2 p a d d l e s , 2 g o a l s , a n d o n e
b o u n c i n g ball) still forms the basis of this latest
edition.
I usually a p p r o a c h remakes o f classic g a m e s with
trepidation as they rarely live up to reputation (eg
S p a c e Invaders a n d m o r e recently Rampage
World Tour), since the o l d concepts can n o longer
c o m p e t e in the continuously a d v a nc ing (at least
from a technological point of view) g a m i n g world.
This version of P o n g however completely blasted
away any such doubt. The g a m e is fantastic - its
a m a z i n g how many ways the programmers have
w a n g l e d different g a m e s out of one simple c o n -
cept.
Take o n e snow scene a n d a d d to it penguins who,
when hit, give you more balls to c o p e with. W i n
this comparatively easy level (by scoring 10 first)
a n d you'll have to d e a l with intruding polar bears
a n d shifts in wind direction. Then take football,
give e a c h player 2 paddles (one goalie a n d one
striker) a n d try to score 1 0 goals. Beat this a n d
you'll get molehills, tie a n d the g a m e will b e set-
tled on a penalty shoot-out. The key to the success
of this g a m e is the realistic physics of the ball. It
moves a n d responds in utter perfection, a n d this
factor c o u p l e d with s o m e of the best graphics I
have seen for the Playstation m e a n that you c a n -
not but gloat at the eye candy e m a n a t i n g from the
screen.
Pong has m u c h in the w a y of lasting a p p e a l -
g a m e s are short e n o u g h to play against the c o m -
puter o r a mate whenever, whatever. In single
player m o d e you'll need t o beat certain levels to
unlock others ensuring there is always reason t o
c o m e back for more until every world a n d every
g a m i n g a r e n a have been u n c o v e r e d . All in all,
Pong is a brilliant remake of its forefather, a win-
ning f o r m u l a which has b e e n given a m a k e o v e r
with e n o u g h frilly extras t o guarantee that it still
works in this modernised world.
