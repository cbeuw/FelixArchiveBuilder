22 November 1999 â€¢ Felix Feedback 13
D e a r Felix,
I have just read your Issue 1 1 5 7
a n d agree w h o l e heartedly with
" B e n Jones (not my real n a m e ) " ' s
f e e d b a c k letter. Felix is read by a lot
of the M e d i c s not b a s e d at the
South K e n . C a m p u s , as it gives us
all a link with what is g o i n g o n at
South K e n . Felix is entertaining,
informative a n d r e a d a b l e . However,
c o n c e r n i n g the c o m m e n t s m a d e
a b o u t Prince Albert, I w a s s h o c k e d .
Prince Albert, a n d the previous
m a g a z i n e s f o r the M e d i c s , a r e not
meant to insult, offend o r disgust
any reader. They are witty, silly a n d ,
alright, s o m e t i m e s puerile but
everyone loves t h e m ! They a r e a
tradition of the M e d i c a l S c h o o l s
a n d are a light relief f r o m everyday
work a n d toil. T h e p e o p l e that write
for the m a g a z i n e s are m a n y a n d
unprejudiced. I a m sure that the
Physics d e p a r t m e n t h a v e funny
jokes a b o u t the M e c h E n g . depart-
ment a n d vice versa. The medics
have funny digs at non-medics just
as the non-medics have funny digs
at t h e m , they are not m e a n t p e r s o n -
ally n o r to offend a n d most medics
are g o o d friends with the other n o n -
m e d i c a l students at IC.

D e a r Sir,
There has recently b e e n a n
increasing n u m b e r of letters to Felix
regarding the treatment of M e d i c s
by Felix itself. This must surely be
w e l c o m e d , as any d e b a t e r e g a r d i n g
the publication is beneficial to its
development. I have but a few
points I wish to m a k e :
Every n e w s p a p e r asserts its o w n
individuality a n d style, this a p p e a l s
to certain segments in society a n d
allows a niche to d e v e l o p . H o w e v -
er, Felix is s u p p o s e d to be the news-
p a p e r of all of Imperial C o l l e g e ,
therefore it has the responsibility of
representing the views of all stu-
dents in all departments. A s s u c h ,
w h e n i n f l a m m a t o r y articles a r e
repeatedly printed a b o u t M e d i c s
(part of IC, whether a n y o n e likes it
or not) it is irresponsible of the Felix
staff to provide u n b a l a n c e d o p i n -
ions, a n d state 'facts' that a r e r e g u -
larly d u b i o u s in their nature. I pre-
sume that the students write these
articles d o so because they have at
least s o m e interest in reporting, so it
makes sense to e n c o u r a g e journal-
istic integrity by confirming facts
a n d writing unbiased pieces.
The silliest thing I have read in
Felix is the editor attempting to
d e f e n d anonymity of ' M i s h M a s h ' .
H e has passed responsibility of this
c o l u m n o n to its writer, w h o has
shirked responsibility by not giving
his/her o w n n a m e . Y o u are al! pass-
ing the buck without any of y o u
having the guts to stand by your
o p i n i o n s . Y o u d o not represent
Imperial C o l l e g e , y o u represent a
bunch of a m a t e u r hacks w h o write
badly.
Yours sincerely,
Bill M c C l a t c h i e

A N D FINALLY...
D e a r Editor,
Reading your letters p a g e , two
o r three things j u m p e d out at m e ,
a n d urged m e to put finger to key-
b o a r d :
Firstly, Tasha's discussion viz a
viz Waterstone's; perhaps I c a n
inform the debate a little by reveal-
ing that C o l l e g e a w a r d e d the b o o k
store contract to the c o m p a n y (and
not to I C U , w h o h a d reliably been
running the bookstore f o r years)
b e c a u s e they promised that " T h e IC
Waterstone's will be o u r Flagship
A c a d e m i c Store". Y e a h , a n d the
Titanic was unsinkable.
Secondly, I a m sure y o u have
heard of c o u p l e s using C o l l e g e
facilities f o r uses other than those
intended, as RSMII suggested? I
refer of course to J o h n Foster a n d
Annette de Lima, using o u r prized
a c a d e m i c centres as conference
facilities a b o v e a l l . I w a s so h o n -
o u r e d to receive my fees invoice
f r o m IC last year in a n envelope
franked " C H O O S E IMPERIAL C O L -
L E G E F O R Y O U R C O N F E R E N C E " .
I also support Tasha N e w t o n
1 1 0 % in her bid to establish a n
alternative to the N U S . It's a b o u t
time a n Imperial S a b b a t i c a l got o n
with this - lazy slackers e a c h a n d
every o n e of her predecessors.
With kind regards,
