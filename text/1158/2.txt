In Brief
CAMBRIDGE INITIATE
NEW LINK-UP WITH MIT
A partnership a g r e e m e n t between
C a m b r i d g e University a n d the
Massachusetts Institute of T e c h n o l -
ogy has b e e n hailed by the g o v e r n -
ment as a " p a t h - b r e a k i n g i n n o v a -
tion" which will f o r m the basis for
the future of g l o b a l higher e d u c a -
tion.
Details of the final project are
still sketchy, as the d e a l has so far
only received a p p r o v a l f r o m both
sides in terms of b r o a d principles,
but it is already k n o w n that the
" C M I " will have f u n d i n g of at least
£84 million. O f this, £68 million
will c o m e f r o m the Treasury's C a p -

MED S C H O O L S ACT TO
END DISCRIMINATION
M e d i c a l s c h o o l s across the country
are a c t i n g to c o u n t e r recent
research which suggests that there
is an unwitting bias towards w o m e n
a n d whites. A c c o r d i n g to the
research, c o n d u c t e d by N o t t i n g -
ham's Professor D a v i d J a m e s , most
of the discrimination occurs at the
a p p l i c a t i o n stage, a n d c o n s e q u e n t -
ly it's a p p l i c a t i o n s p r o c e d u r e s that
are under review. A l t h o u g h qualifi-
cations are not an issue, Prof J a m e s
believes that asking p e o p l e to list
activities that d e m o n s t r a t e their
g o o d qualities (empathising, time
m a n a g e m e n t , t e a m w o r k i n g , priori-
tising, caring etc) is the p r o b l e m , as
w o m e n a n d whites tend to get
involved in m o r e extracurricular
activities.
As a result, this year N o t t i n g -
h a m has a s k e d its applicants to
detail experiences f r o m their lives,
rather than just listing activities.
O t h e r m e d i c a l schools are devising
action plans, e n c o u r a g e d by the
C o u n c i l of H e a d s of M e d i c a l
S c h o o l s , a n d will be watching the
results of N o t t i n g h a m ' s c h a n g e s
with interest.
