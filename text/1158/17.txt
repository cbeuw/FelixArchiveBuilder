A soundtrack a l b u m f r o m a
H o l l y w o o d blockbuster c a n be
an exercise in mediocrity. H o w -
ever this effort, from a film star-
ring Kate Beckinsale a n d C l a i r e
D a n e s , strives to g o a bit fur-
ther. The film is a b o u t two girls
w h o , whilst on holiday in T h a i -
l a n d , get falsely a c c u s e d of
drug s m u g g l i n g - a crime that
can deserve the death penalty
in B a n g k o k . As such the a l b u m
is filled with a lot of f e m a l e
vocalists getting e m o t i o n a l
over r o l l i n g , 'ethnic1
beats.
These songs mostly a n n o y with
their sameness a n d lack of any
new ideas. A few tracks d o
stand out t h o u g h : S a r a h Bright-
m a n a d d s a g o s p e l twist whilst
PJ Harvey gives us a m o r e
quirky s o u n d .
Thankfully, the m a l e contingent
m a k e up for the rather ordinary
tunes supplied by the girls. Two
excellent, m o r e u p b e a t tracks
by A u d i o w e b a n d A s i a n D u b
Foundation m a k e the a l b u m
more bearable. Tricky d o e s his
m u m b l i n g stuff with DJ M u g g s
but still fails to disappoint. H a d
a m e m b e r of the opposite sex
written this it w o u l d have per-
f o r m e d better.
N o t staple listening by any
m e a n s but it contains e n o u g h
tasty morsels to m a k e me c o m e
back for seconds.

Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic
(Arista)
W h e n an a l b u m by an a g e i n g artist is full of guest a p p e a r a n c e s
i n c l u d i n g C h u c k D, Sheryl C r o w , A n i D i F r a n c o a n d G w e n Stefani (of
N o D o u b t ) , it's a l m o s t certainly d o w n to a lack of o r i g i n a l material
a n d a n e e d to a d d 'designer names' to a p o o r p r o d u c t to increase
sales (please refer to Tom Jones). He's a p p e a r e d in both the A m e r i -
c a n B i l l b o a r d p o p a n d R&B chart every year since 1 9 7 8 a n d no
d o u b t this impressive r e c o r d will c o n t i n u e with the singles to be t a k e n
f r o m this a l b u m .
T h e Press Release states that The Artist ' b r e a k s new g r o u n d every
time he releases m u s i c . N o t only as a visionary trailblazer with his
constant e x p l o r a t i o n , but as an innovative t r a i l b l a z e r ' , but if you'd
fallen into a c o m a for fifteen years a n d w o k e n up to h e a r his new
a l b u m , you c o u l d be forgiven for thinking that you'd just b e e n in a
p r o l o n g e d sleep. This is a l o n g way f r o m the c o o l n e s s a n d sophisti-
c a t i o n of G e t O f f a n d Cream. Instead Prince has m a n a g e d to recre-
ate the type of s o u n d that he n e e d e d the N e w Power G e n e r a t i o n for.
Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic is classic Prince. He c o m p o s e d ,
a r r a n g e d a n d p r o d u c e d the a l b u m a n d in a n t i c i p a t i o n of its release
G e o r g e M i c h a e l wrote the s o n g Too Funky as a s u m m a t i o n of its
s o u n d . The Artist c o m b i n e s rock guitaring with nu-funk giving the lis-
tener m o r e t w a n g s than a c o r d u r o y c o n c e r t a n d Phil's seventies djing
put together.
F r o m the first s o n g (that takes the s a m e title as the a l b u m ) Rave Un2
the Joy Fantastic The Artist hits you with a wall of s o u n d , his v o i c e as
p o w e r f u l a n d distinctive as ever. His c o l l a b o r a t i o n s are often barely
n o t i c e a b l e , relying o n his f a m o u s cast as b a c k i n g singers a n d m u s i -
c i a n s . A n e x c e p t i o n to this is his c o v e r of Every Day Is A Winding
Road with Sheryl C r o w which is n o t h i n g short of brilliant. M o s t m o d -
ern d a y covers are merely the s a m e s o n g with a different v o i c e (see
Placebo's 2 0 t h Century Boy). The Artist puts a c o m p l e t e l y different
interpretation o n the s o n g t h o u g h , I didn't even realise it was a c o v e r
until he hit the c h o r u s .
If you're a Prince f a n then this a l b u m won't d i s a p p o i n t . For those of
y o u e x p e c t i n g s o m e t h i n g new t h o u g h , you'll find a return to the roots
never d i d a n y o n e h a r m a n d it has w o r k e d in giving The Artist a m u c h
n e e d e d r e s u r g e n c e of life.

Bossa Tres... Jazz
(Warner)
This C D is the result of a Japanese-
French c o l l a b o r a t i o n p r o d u c i n g a fusion
of Jazz, Latino a n d D a n c e . It is over 1 1 0
minutes of, apparently, "pure, d e e p , jazzy
grooves". It is c l a i m e d that this project "is
an o d e to ecstatic diversity, richness a n d
o p e n - m i n d e d values, a soothing a n d
serene pathway into the new millennium".
This is a mighty big claim to live up to.
O n e w o u l d expect that with the mish-
m a s h of national cultures a n d musical
styles involved, a n exciting, interesting
a n d original s o u n d w o u l d result. FAT
C H A N C E . It so lacks originality that it
c o u l d have been p r o d u c e d by any of the
w e a k e r m e m b e r s of the early nineties
a c i d jazz scene. The majority of the tracks
are just so lifeless a n d b o r i n g : they just
don't g o anywhere. N o w this might be
b e a r a b l e if the tracks were short but these
"jazz entrepreneurs" have d e e m e d it nec-
essary for the listening public to endure at
least six minutes of repetitive jam before a
break. To m a k e matters worse, the beats
are uninteresting in the extreme.
N o w this is not to say that this C D is total-
ly terrible but if you want something that
is interesting a n d listenable then the
majority of the tunes just don't cut it. The
exceptions to this are Cilberto a n d Can-
domble, which blends a great eastern
guitar riff with experimental dithering key-
b o a r d .
In c o n c l u s i o n , this project provides an
endless stream of musical m e a n d e r i n g s
that are pleasant e n o u g h to the ear but
after a few tracks tends to bore.
