Registry refuse to block bailiff threat
ANDREW OFORI
Registry bureaucracy almost h a d the
bailiffs knocking at student's doors
last week when the local C o u n c i l
forced students to defend themselves
against erroneous tax claims.
The chaos started when West-
minister C o u n c i l lost s o m e students'
paperwork a n d d e m a n d e d they pay
council tax. All full-time students a r e
exempt from the tax and only need to
provide their local C o u n c i l with a cer-
tificate from their Registry Office. Even
though the three students w h o shared
the a c c o m m o d a t i o n h a d d o n e this,
the C o u n c i l p l a g u e d them with
monthly calls last year d e m a n d i n g
they pay. O n each occasion the indi-
viduals would explain that the neces-
sary forms h a d been sent. Their
details would then b e checked a n d
apologies m a d e .
As the students were not there to
defend themselves over the summer,
the C o u n c i l b e c a m e convinced they
had tax dodgers o n their hands a n d
the bemused trio were s u m m o n e d to
court. O n e of them explained " W e
were really stunned." They reacted
quickly, contacting Westminister
C o u n c i l a n d once again insisting that
their details h a d been sent a n d they
were told the necessary information
had indeed been received a n d the
case would be d r o p p e d .
The students were overwhelmed
when they received a letter o n 14
N o v e m b e r informing them the court
case had gone a h e a d , they had been
tried in absentia a n d the magistrate
had ordered baliffs to arrive in two
weeks. T h e letter w a s dated 1 1
N o v e m b e r leaving them only eleven
days to save their possessions. T h e
C o u n c i l was n o w insisting o n a new
exemption certificate and the students
rushed to the Registry office in hope
of a saviour.
They were told they would have
to wait a week a n d were frantic w h e n ,
having explained the desperation of
the situation, the reply d i d not
change.. They brought their case to
ICU President Tasha N e w t o n , who felt
the Registry's response w a s "totally
unacceptable" and took the matter to
the Deputy A c a d e m i c Registrar. It was
agreed the students could collect their
forms that day, but o n arrival they
were told they would have to wait
another two days. O n l y after a return
trip to M s . N e w t o n d i d they receive
the papers.
The certificates have n o w been
sent to the C o u n c i l , w h o have p r o m -
ised to confirm that baliffs will not b e
sent, a n d that the students' credit rat-
ings will remain intact. M s . Newton
was dismayed by the Registry office's
lack of c o m p a s s i o n : "Their job is to
help people, if they can't d o their job
because they can't c o p e then they are
simply not d o i n g their job."
O n e student w h o is looking into
taking legal action against Westmin-
ister C o u n c i l for harassment stated
"Registry a r e more interested in their
own standard procedure a n d bureau-
cracy than our needs."

Despite rumours to the contrary, it
a p p e a r s that construction of t h e
new M u l t i - D i s c i p l i n a r y R e s e a r c h
Building (MDRB) is well u n d e r w a y
a n d , weather permitting, construc-
tion o u g h t t o b e c o m p l e t e o n
schedule.
The new nine-storeyed b u i l d i n g ,
located b e h i n d t h e Biochemistry
building, is to house a n d e n c o u r a g e
scientific research projects that a r e
of a multidisciplinary nature, t o try
a n d e n c o u r a g e better c o m m u n i c a -
tion between departments.

s i o n , e x p l a i n e d that construction
has been put back a week d u e t o
p r o b l e m s with d i g g i n g foundations.
D a n i e l F o r e m a n of the Heery Pro-
ject M a n a g e m e n t C o m p a n y , w h o is
co-ordinating the work, explained
that the Imperial site is very o l d , a n d
consequently the process h a s b e e n
h a m p e r e d by underlying debris left
over f r o m previous structures.
The b u i l d i n g is apparently still
on b u d g e t , t h o u g h , a n d construc-
tion work is expected t o finish by
January o r February, with the b u i l d -
ing o p e n i n g f o r use by N o v e m b e r

ect were constructed before being
rejected, but a g a i n , that is n o r m a l
for projects this size.
