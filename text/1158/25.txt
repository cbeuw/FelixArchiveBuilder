H o w m u c h d o you value your privacy? D o you have any skeletons in your clos-
et that you don't want people to find out? H o w would you feel if your life was
televised to over a 1 0 0 million people 2 4 hours a day, 7 days a week? Well,
Ron H o w a r d thrusts these questions u p o n Ed Pekurny in his new movie, EDfv.
Last year we got The Truman Show dealing with the crisis of a man w h o does
not know that his life is being televised to the rest of the world. The story deals
with a cable c o m p a n y w h o , in a desperate attempt to improve their ratings,
employ a 31 year-old video store clerk, Ed Pekurny (Matthew M c C o n a u g h e y ) .
They want Ed to allow his life a n d his interactions with the rest of his family a n d
friends to be televised 2 4 hours a day, 7 days a week for a certain length of
time. H e agrees under pressure from his brother Ray (Woody Harrelson) a n d
then, unknowingly proceeds to wreak havoc o n his family a n d friends by
attracting unwanted attention to them.
The big difference between The Truman Show a n d EDfv is that in The Truman
Show, the main character was being filmed without his consent, while in EDtv
the character is being filmed out of his o w n choice. N o w would anyone real-
ly want to d o that? To a w a k e n in the morning to two cameras directed toward
your face or to g o to b a t h r o o m with a c a m e r a m a n waiting outside to catch
you as s o o n as you walk out the door. Apparently some people are willing to
do this! Provided that you c a n believe this point, then the movie is a generally
enjoyable o n e where y o u don't have to think t o o m u c h . It's very obvious that
Ron H o w a r d is trying to m a k e a point about the rapidly deteriorating A m e r i -
can m e d i a culture (to g o a l o n g with o u r British one), but perhaps he should
first look closer at people w h o are willing to make a mockery of their lives a n d
those of their friends a n d family in a desperate attempt to attract attention to
themselves. A s o n e character says, "People used to be considered famous for
being special. N o w they're just considered special for being famous."
The acting is fine by everyone in the cast. The acting by W o o d y Harrelson as
the brother, Ray a n d Martin Landau as the stepfather, A l really stands out. Lan-
dau is absolutely hilarious in each scene he's in a n d W o o d y Harrelson contin-
ues to provide fine supporting c o m i c turns. A n d R o b Reiner, director of films
such as A Few Good Men a n d This Is Spinal Tap, plays the head Studio Exec-
utive.
W h e n this movie w a s released in A m e r i c a it was unfairly c o m p a r e d with The
Truman Show a n d consequently suffered at the box office. While they have the
same basic idea, The Truman Show was more original a n d , to me, superior to
EDtv, which seems like a n extended sitcom. However, they are still different
movies that should be judged separately - a n d the movie provides a n enjoy-
able night out. Just as long as you're not being followed by c a m e r a m e n . . . .
O n e simple word applies to this film, which c a n be repeated a n arbitrary n u m -
ber of times at your leisure: "Why?" U p o n hearing of Carrie 2 - The Rage, this
is probably the same question that fans of Carrie, the 1 9 7 6 Brian D e Palma
classic, m a y also be asking. Twenty years after the first film, we are re-intro-
duced to high school life in the US. The first film m a d e a huge contribution to
starting audiences' obsession with adolescent issues a n d w a s seen by many to
be incredibly effective, with both its emotional themes a n d its offbeat, slightly
disturbing visuals.
The sequel, like the original, has a lead heroine a r m e d with the power of
telekinesis. In spite of her suspicious similarity to the original Carrie (who was
wondrously acted by Oscar-nominated Sissy Spacek), there are a few differ-
ences. H e r name isn't Carrie, it's Rachel, a n d she isn't a naive, vulnerable
pubescent unaware of her secret talents. Rachel (Emily Bergl) is a n angry G o t h ,
and she knows all too well of her ability to fling objects using the power of her
mind.
The overall premise is almost identical to Carrie. Rachel is a n outsider, differ-
ent to most other school kids. A g a i n , there is a m a n i a c a l , god-fearing mother,
helping to explain to us why Rachel got into that world-hating state in the first
place. However, where Carrie's mother was a disturbing, ever-present force
throughout the original film, a d d i n g to its imposing m o o d , Rachel's mother
(played convincingly by J Smith C a m e r o n ) is safely locked away in A r k h a m
Asylum. There is very little point to her character, other than to force a link
between the two films. It turns out that Carrie a n d Rachel are half-sisters, relat-
ed by their womanizing father. The plot flows almost identically to the former
film, with similar set pieces. Eventually, towards the e n d of the film, w e are
awarded with a fantastic special effects laden finale. C o m b i n e d with over the
top gore, it becomes nearly impossible to care about the characters anymore.
You'll have more fun sitting back a n d laughing at the death scenes.
The Rage is disappointing but there are some pleasing performances through-
out the cast, especially from Emily Bergl in her big screen debut. O d d l y , clips
from the first movie are unnecessarily spliced into some of the scenes a n d Car-
rie fans will even recognise familiar sounds edited into the soundtrack. You
can't blame anyone for c o m p a r i n g the two films. Unfortunately, whatever tech-
nique is employed, nothing will distract you from c o m i n g to the conclusion that
The Rage is anything more than a n updated remake. W h a t is unacceptable is
that, in the end, the story is redundant. You're probably better off renting Car-
rie o n video. It is also difficult to r e c o m m e n d the film. The difficulty a n d d i s a p -
pointment lies in the fact that despite all the pointlessness, there is a lot of o b v i -
ous talent in this movie, a n d whether you like it o r not, the ranks of hot, young
acting ability will continue to grow.
