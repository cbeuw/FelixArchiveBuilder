A c c o m p a n i e d by several a m a t e u r
Ali G s (Here m e n o w . . . R e c o g n i s e !
etc.), a n d a variety of other equally
bizarre characters, m y trip b e g a n
outside the U n i o n b u i l d i n g at 6 : 0 0
on Friday e v e n i n g . I h a d never
actually b e e n with the I C M C o n
o n e o f their trips o u t of L o n d o n
before, despite h a v i n g b e e n c l i m b -
ing with t h e m for two years o n arti-
ficial walls in L o n d o n , s o I w a s
unsure o f h o w m u c h I w a s g o i n g t o
enjoy myself. I a m , I'll be the first t o
admit, a pansy, a n d have never
e x p e r i e n c e d the (apparent) delights
of c a m p i n g a n d i n a d e q u a t e toilet
facilities a n d I felt as if this was p e r -
haps t h r o w i n g myself in at t h e
d e e p - e n d a t o u c h . I've a l w a y s
been a hotel m a n myself.
W e left, a n d after a fairly
uneventful journey (which involved
eating the most f o o d I've ever
eaten in my entire life in s o m e r a n -
d o m t o w n ) , w e a r r i v e d at t h e
c a m p s i t e . Surprisingly, it w a s n ' t
raining (even t h o u g h I h a d c h e c k e d
the w e a t h e r report: my luck is m u c h
m o r e efficient than the Met). It was
dark, however, w h i c h m a d e m y
attempts at helping t o put a tent u p
m u c h less than useful, but e v e n t u -
ally w e were set u p a n d , t h o u g h
c o l d , w e were still dry. For the most
part. Alex, however, h a d d e c i d e d
he was g o i n g t o relieve himself in
the traditional m a l e f a s h i o n . H e
c o u l d s e e the bark of the c h o s e n
tree reflecting the c o o l m o o n l i g h t in
the dark (he h a d no torch), a n d the
hypnotising effect it h a d o n h i m
c o m p l e t e l y b l i n d e d him t o the fact
that it w a s in the m i d d l e of a
stream. H e c h a n g e d , a n d w e ail
went to o u r tents.
T h e next m o r n i n g b r o u g h t
mostly c o l d , I r e m e m b e r , b u t
a c c o r d i n g to the others it was quite
a nice day. I was u n c o n v i n c e d , hav-
ing always b e e n u n d e r the impres-
sion that o n e needs feeling in the
fingers t o c l i m b effectively. I w a s
w a r n e d that this w a s pessimistic,
a n d told t o stop c o m p l a i n i n g . S o
off w e went. W e drove to T h e
R o a c h e s , which w a s w h e r e were
g o i n g to s p e n d o u r w e e k e n d c l i m b -
ing, a n d after s o m e w a n d e r i n g a n d
w o n d e r i n g , we d u m p e d o u r stuff o n
a big rock, p a i r e d u p , a n d went off
to find things to c l i m b . I've c l i m b e d
a lot inside, but nothing c o u l d pre-
pare m e f o r the fear of being
attached t o a wall thirty feet u p by
two V E R Y small pieces of metal,
attempting to belay (hold the rope
of) s o m e o n e w h o was a b o u t twenty
foot a b o v e m e . I w a s afraid. Very
a f r a i d . But I have to say that getting
to the top (and s o m e o f the inter-
vening period) was very e n j o y a b l e .
A l t h o u g h I'll never a d m i t that to my
c l i m b i n g partner ( w h o m I h o l d fully
responsible f o r the stains in m y
trousers). The first day went by with-
out s e r i o u s i n c i d e n t f o r u s ,
a l t h o u g h the Rescue Services were
c a l l e d f o r a n o t h e r g r o u p : o n e o f
their m e m b e r s h a d taken a fall.
That evening w e drank. A n d I
played darts (and lost).
O u r s e c o n d d a y d a w n e d , a n d
it w a s d a m p e r , but still not quite
raining. By this time, h o w e v e r I was
b e g i n n i n g t o s e e t h e c o l d a s my
friend (though I'll p r o b a b l y take
warmer, m o r e w a t e r p r o o f clothes
next time, s o m a y b e as a friend
with halitosis), a n d thus was in a far
superior m o o d . W e went to a local
town f o r breakfast, a n d g o t a bit
w a y l a i d , since it n o w h a d b e g u n t o
drizzle a n d the c l o u d s were very
low. W e were there, t h e n , at eleven
o ' c l o c k , s o s o m e of us s a w their
R e m e m b r a n c e D a y p a r a d e , which
w a r m e d the heart of even the c o l d -
est cynic (i.e. me). S o w h e n w e left,
even t h o u g h the weather wasn't a s
g o o d a s the previous day, w e were
all ready to d o s o m e serious c l i m b -
ing, a n d c l i m b w e d i d . However,
o u r luck wasn't as g o o d that day,
a n d w e actually h a d t w o injuries
(more than t h e u s u a l b l e e d i n g
h a n d s , which I've N O W b e e n told
is s t a n d a r d o n grit-stone). O n e o f
these, w e h o p e , h a s b e e n w a l k e d
off, b u t t h e o t h e r required m o r e
serious attention (due to it b e i n g a
b u m p to the b a c k . . . b e t t e r safe than
sorry), s o w e p a c k e d u p a little
early a n d t r o o p e d t o A & E in Stoke-
on-Trent. T h e individual in question
h a d relatives nearby, however, s o
they arrived to relieve us, a n d w e
m a d e o u r way b a c k to L o n d o n . W e
s t o p p e d a g a i n at the s a m e town (if
you ever pass t h r o u g h Lutterworth
g o to the C o t t a g e C h i n e s e Take-
away. M m m m ) w h e r e I ate even
m o r e than the last t i m e , a n d s o o n
we were b a c k in the s p r a w l i n g
metropolis o f L o n d o n . U s i n g a c u n -
ning h u m a n c h a i n w e u n p a c k e d
the g e a r f r o m the v a n in record
time, a n d w e r e all o n o u r way b a c k
h o m e before y o u c a n say " H o w
m u c h m o n e y , like, w o u l d I n e e d , t o
be a M i l l - e e - o n - a i r ? "
W o u l d I d o it a g a i n ? Probably.
W o u l d I r e c o m m e n d it to a n y o n e
else? Definitely. It gets you out of
L o n d o n , a n d in t o u c h with your fear
of mortality, a n d I w o u l d certainly
rate it a s o n e of the most interest-
ing experiences I've h a d while at
IC.
