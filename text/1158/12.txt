D E M O O R D E M O C R A C Y ?
D e a r Felix,
As the proposer of the " N U S
D e m o " resolution passed by i C U
council, I'm pleased to see it stimu-
lating s o m e debate (Breakpoint, Felix
1 1 5 7 ) . I'm a strong believer in
d e m o c r a c y a n d believe that such
debate is its b a c k b o n e . C a n I there-
fore suggest to Mr. (Ms?) "Break-
point" that (s)he submits a paper to
the next union c o u n c i l , allowing
these concerns to be openly debated
in a democratic forum?

D e a r Felix,
I feel I must reply to the points
m a d e in Breakpoint in last weeks
issue. Whilst broadly supporting M r
or M s Point's right to remain anony-
mous, to use this anonymity as a
cloak to hide behind, then level a
series of inacurate criticisms a n d
veiled insults, seems unfair a n d c o w -
ardly.
. . . T h e I C U holy grail is to be
apolitical a n d proud of it. I see noth-
ing to be proud of in standing back
a n d d o i n g nothing while student
hardship is worsening. I see nothing
to be proud of in apathy a n d i g n o -
rance of the wider situation. M o s t of
all, I see nothing to be proud of in
taking cynical sideswipes while a
hard-working few in the national stu-
dent movement d o their level best to
c h a n g e things f o r the better. The
motion to C o u n c i l , if BreakPoint h a d
bothered to check out his o r her
facts, i n c l u d e d a c l a u s e which
deplored "the careerism rife within
the N U S " ; precisely the problem to
which he o r she refers.
Incidentally, o n e might ask why
s u p p o r t i n g a d e m o n s t r a t i o n is
regarded as "playing in the murky
world of politics" but o p p o s i n g o n e ,
criticising various M P s a n d govern-
ment proposals for the Lords isn't? I
don't think this is a coherent position;
it smacks of d o u b l e standards, but
then apathy in the face of cut-backs
a n d other denigrations has always
suited the right wing.
....Breakpoint's sniffiness about
" n e w " members of council are tanta-
mount to a n argument f o r ensuring
the U n i o n is always run by the s a m e
old tried a n d tested hacks...If Break-
Point is unhappy with the democratic
processes of the U n i o n , any sugges-
tions for improvement w o u l d be w e l -
c o m e . Life-long elective dictatorship
for presidents perhaps?
Finally, I'll leave y o u - a n d
BreakPoint - with this thought: the
a m o u n t spent o n advertising the
demonstration is a tiny fraction of the
a n n u a l pewter tankard budget.

RIVALRY RELIGHTS
D e a r Felix,
I would like to raise a couple of
issues about Mr. Ganesarajah's c o l -
u m n in Felix last week. Firstly, h o w
does the statement that C & G fresh-
ers have a n A-level points average of
2 9 , which obviously makes them
superior to all the other freshers at
Imperial, have any relevance to the
" b i g question" of what C & G U c a n
d o f o r them? To imply that C & G
graduates earn more than other IC
graduates purely because of the fact
they have a n "industry orientated"
degree is nonsense. I think that the
medics m a y claim quite rightly that
their degree's are actually rather
more "industry related" than those of
C & G , since the vast majority of I C S M
graduates are actually g o i n g to use
their qualification for their job, rather
than taking the highly original choice
of m a n a g e m e n t consultancy. Also, I
don't r e m e m b e r junior doctors hav-
ing a huge choice in starting salary!
The fact that the courses in R S M are
actually designed with industry help
is obviously not a n example of hav-
ing a lucrative "industry orientated"
degree, since A R S M is the a c k n o w l -
e d g e d b e n c h m a r k f o r excellence
around the world in the mining a n d
petroleum industries. I w o u l d also
like to ask; w h o is the more r o u n d e d
graduate? S o m e o n e from R S M o r
I C S M w h o graduates having learnt
social a n d interpersonal skills by
going to social events whilst studying,
o r the C & G star w h o has 2 9 U C A S
points but has never g o n e out.
Surely, the " b i g question" that
C & G students should be asking is
how their exec is still organizing
events that fail to improve their social
a n d recreational skills, since n o o n e
turns u p to them, hence the heavy
losses. For the President of C & G U to
say that he doesn't mind if they waste
their U n i o n resources is inappropri-
ate a n d not helping his students. If he
want's to see a well run event, that
appeals to students, he could d o
worse than attend the R S M Christ-
mas Ball. O u r Freshers Dinner h a d
nearly 5 0 % of the freshers attending.
The d a y C & G U m a n a g e 2 5 % , I'll
take my hat off a n d say well d o n e .
Yours faithfully,
Matt C o c k a y n e ,
R S M U President
MEDICAL DEFENCE
D e a r Felix,
I agree with Ben Jones (not my
real name) M e d i c i n e 4 o n the subject
that Felix has improved vastly, but the
idea of Prince Albert is to not be a
Felix clone. It is to give the medics
across the c a m p u s e s s o m e light-
hearted h u m o u r a n d s o m e t h i n g
alternative to read. Y o u won't find the
latest cinema/music/sports reviews
as in the more formal production of
Felix; rather a light-hearted a n d
humorous look at life o n the various
medical campuses, various a m u s i n g ,
r a n d o m articles ( D o y o u , Ben Jones,
own a llama ??) a n d the jolly capers
of s o m e of those in the m e d schools
(activities of which often d o involve
rude words) !! Whilst Prince Albert
does g o over the t o p sometimes,
w h o cares ?? If you a r e so sensitive
as to be insulted by the material in
Prince Albert, perhaps y o u should
leave your copy u n o p e n e d a n d give
it to s o m e o n e w h o will appreciate it
for what it is (i.e. most of the p o p u l a -
tion of the M e d Schools !!).
