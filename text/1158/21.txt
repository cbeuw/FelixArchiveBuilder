" W h o will rid m e off this turbulent Priest?" - said the K i n g ; meet
the m e n w h o d i d - they h a c k e d the A r c h B i s h o p to pieces o n the
altar of his c a t h e d r a l .
T h o m a s a Becket w a s the Priest, Henry II the K i n g , the f o u r
knights the m u r d e r e r s . T h e p e o p l e loved Becket a n d so the
Knights h a d to k e e p a l o w profile, very low. They lived short of
f o o d a n d heat in a castle in K n a r e s b o u g h so the e n r a g e d B e c k -
et supporters d i d not lynch t h e m . I g u e s s e d that this story h a d
b e e n given a m o r e m o d e r n e d g e w h e n the Knights c a l l e d Beck-
et a " c o m p l e t e a n d utter fuck w i t " a n d d e s c r i b e d his m u r d e r as
"the worst c a r e e r m o v e in history"
T h e play e x p l o r e s the effect of such a terrible d e e d a n d s u b s e -
q u e n t i s o l a t i o n . T h e knights cherish "Loyalty a b o v e a l l , loyalty"
to the King a n d to e a c h other - but c a n it stop t h e m f r o m
destroying e a c h whilst u n d e r the strain of b e i n g l o c k e d in the
castle?
W e see the d e g e n e r a t i o n of the knights together a n d a l o n e f o r
such a time. They get drunk all the time o n b a d w i n e a n d a r e
subject to great bouts of sexual frustration - o n e of them loves
the h o u s e m a i d , w h o is in love with o n e of the other knights,
w h o , in turn, has t u r n e d into a m a d d r u n k e n recluse... M e a n -
w h i l e , the other t w o knights used to love e a c h other - very c o n -
f u s i n g !
At o n e p o i n t they b e c o m e so b o r e d with such utter i s o l a t i o n -
a n d as their p l a c e within the l o c a l c o m m u n i t y h a d r e a c h e d l e g -
e n d a r y status - that they o p e n the castle to the p u b l i c a n d pre-
tend that they a r e praying all day, only eating b r e a d before b e d
time.
If there is a star in this strong cast it is J o h n n y Lee Miller, of
Trainspotting f a m e , b r i n g i n g that extra kick that m a d e the play
really c o m e to life. Richard W i l s o n shows w h a t a n a c c o m p l i s h e d
theatre m a n he is as d i r e c t o r of this fast m o v i n g witty, s h a r p a n d
d a r i n g play. A joy to w a t c h ; the Tricycle theatre has d o n e it
a g a i n .
Your four best friends - the lads together-
then o n e of them h a n g s himself.
Four characters, using d a n c e , joke telling
a n d acting, portray the difficulties facing the
four m e n d e a l i n g with this death a n d its
effect o n their relationships with e a c h other.
The p e r f o r m a n c e style is set somewhere
between c o n t e m p o r a r y d a n c e a n d more tra-
ditional acting. This perhaps means that to
truly appreciate the s h o w y o u need a certain
k n o w l e d g e a n d a p p r e c i a t i o n of the use of
motion a n d d a n c e in theatre.
The p r o d u c t i o n is brave a n d Frantic A s s e m -
bly (the p r o d u c t i o n company) has h a d a
string of successes a n d a West End tour
since it f o r m e d in 1 9 9 4 using this blend of
the two arts. T h e overall effect in hymns pro-
duces s o m e very entertaining scenes when
motion a n d sp e e c h are used effectively.
The acting, however, badly let d o w n the
m a i n story, with the portrayal of the main
characters as " l a d s " falling flat. Two of the
actors were just f a r t o o c a m p to effectively
pull off ladism - mayby that's all you c a n
expect from such g o o d d a n c e r s !
The characters individual mental struggles
d e a l i n g with the loss of o n e of their crew
l a c k e d p u n c h . S o m e of the physicality of the
d a n c e went s o m e w a y to touch the a u d i e n c e
but otherwise we were not emotionally
involved. A n entertaining s h o w that in its 6 0
minute p e r f o r m a n c e p r o d u c e s funny scenes
using both m o t i o n a n d s p a c e , but with no
real d r a m a .
