U C L are a funny side - they don't
look as male as most of the people
we play against. A n d they c a n play
football (apparently) since they beat
us 9-0 in the league a w e e k a g o .
But the IC spirit reigned supreme -
it's the W e d n e s d a y feeling of n o lec-
tures, stuff the coursework, play the
g a m e a n d hit the b a r (not the w o o d -
work). It's in B U S A that we're invin-
cible. A n o t h e r match, another result,
another 3 points well earned (if
slightly o n the fortunate side).
A n impressive o p e n i n g from the
Shady Ladies resulted in early goals.
H e d g e , Vasso a n d Frenchie were
impenetrable (much to their d i s a p -
pointment) in defence a n d fed m i d -
fielders Tart, Louise a n d Girlfriend
with great balls to their hearts c o n -
tent. Tina showed excellent skill in
her debut performance. H e r long
ball f o u n d Jazzy Jeff w h o d o d g e d
the b e m u s e d defence a n d her flashy
cross f o u n d the boot of the talented
C l a r k Kent. It w a s 1 -0 to us.
IC were sharp in intercepting the
wild U C L passes a n d were quick o n
the attack. A flick from The M a y o r
l a n d e d in Kent's way, w h o went o n
to cruise past UCL's defence a n d
smash o n e past the helpless goalie.
O u r 2-0 lead relaxed o u r t e a m ,
but half-time w a s a long time c o m -
ing (it usually is unfortunately). T h e
break w a s used well by U C L to
recover a n d think tactics. This w a s
shortly followed by another, debat-
a b l e , g o a l - definitely offside (we're
thinking pitch length here) but the ref
was t o o busy looking at D u m b a n d
D u m b e r ' s legs to notice. W h a t h a d
been a n entertaining first half quick-
ly turned into scrappy S o u t h a m p t o n
passing, hopeful W i m b l e d o n style
long balls, a n d the sort of finishing
Newcastle would be proud to exhib-
it. A couple of (tactical?) substitu-
tions later, a n d the ball once more
found it's w a y into the U C L half -
over a n d over a g a i n . Images of the
first half (bails flying at us, but not
being able to put them away) haunt-
ed us e a c h time the ball flew into
their penalty area. Spurred o n by
M a e a n d H a r d Kaur's persistence,
Kent turned o n a defender a n d the
pressure w a s t o o much. T h e U C L
player obviously wanted to be o n the
winning side a n d aided in the 3-2
victor/. A n o w n g o a l , a miracle, a n d
the sweet s o u n d of the full-time whis-
tle has never been s o appreciated.
G'n'T, once a g a i n , saved the d a y
with superb saves. She's just t o o
g o o d .

Unfazed by the wind a n d rain w e
found when w e arrived, w e w a r m e d
up in the changing r o o m . This was a
must win g a m e a n d the boys c a m e
out really fired up. The forwards in
particular h a d a great g a m e with
Charlie C u n w e l l a n d J o n B o u n d
leading the charge. After s o m e great
rucking Dune Rainey crossed in the
corner for the first try. W e g o t lazy
early o n a n d they scored a dull try.
This spurred the boys into action a n d
a try from Dave G a y a n d two from
James Philip c o n d e m n e d U E A to the
shark tank. W e hot-wired their trac-
tors, foiled the cunning female assas-
sins a n d showed them o u r g o l d e n -
eye.

After a sadistically early start in
South Kensington w e -arrived in a
land of no electricity, heating o r sun
shine. W e were quickly c h a n g e d a n d
raring to g o . That w a s until the
weather set in ...but in the true spir-
it of IC Rugby w e braved the sleet
a n d hail.
A l t h o u g h the weather w a s still
bitterly c o l d at kick-off, the troops
were fired u p a n d read to g o . T h e
first quarter w a s highly uneventful,
with the conditions hampering the
efforts of both sides, but midway
through the first half the IC brilliance
b e g a n to shine through a n d , after a
beautiful passage of play, a quick
shimmy by N i c k Parker broke the
d e a d l o c k with a try in the corner. A t
this point the opposition b e g a n to
wise u p a n d despite continuous
h a m m e r i n g from the likes of Matt,
M o a n d Rick, play stagnated until
early in the second half. The fresh
pair of legs securely attached to T i m
"hello boys" Denyer c h a r g e d their
way towards the line bringing the
score up to 1 0 - 0 . Spurred o n , the
seconds rallied a n d c a m e back with
the taste f o r b l o o d , beating the
defence into submission a n d leading
to yet another try for the Londoners
from Jim, easily converted by Tez.
IC seemed untouchable, but in
the final minutes of the g a m e the
lads from N o r w i c h m a n a g e d t o
push through twice a n d score o n
both occasions, but it w a s a case of
too little t o o late.
