D o I always get this excited w h e n
I g o c l u b b i n g ? O n l y w h e n the
c l u b n i g h t is as g o o d as this o n e .
N o t that I have m a n y less t h a n
brilliant nights at c l u b s . T h i n k i n g
a b o u t it t h o u g h , there is g o o d
reason for this...
The clubs I usually g o to are
o n e s that m a k e a n effort to
impress the c l u b b e r s , rather than
those strange clubs that s e e m to
just w a n t to be c o o l . A n d those
clubs usually fail anyway. K n o w -
ing B e d r o c k well t h e n , after hav-
ing b e e n a n u m b e r of times, I
knew b e f o r e the night even start-
ed that it was g o i n g to be m o r e
than brilliant. Every detail of the
night w a s perfect - the beer, the
v o d k a , the v e n u e , the tunes, the
d a n c i n g . . .
D a n c i n g at B e d r o c k is p e r h a p s
o n e of the most easily a c c e s s i b l e
d a n c e s for a n y o n e . Rather than
h a v i n g to try to d a n c e all y o u
have to d o is turn up a n d let the
music take over. U p l i f t i n g tunes
are aplenty at this v e n u e a n d
that's why this is p e r h a p s the best
c l u b n i g h t I've e v e r b e e n t o .
G o i n g b a c k next m o n t h is t h e r e -
fore s o m e t h i n g I h a v e to d o a n d
a l t h o u g h the e x p e r i e n c e has
given me a b l o c k o n my writing
style, this will never stop m e
g o i n g . S u p e r v e n u e , s u p e r c l u b ;
B e d r o c k kicks arse.
G e t y o u the m e s s a g e ? Y o u
s h o u l d d o , so d o n ' t mess u p !

all this scratching is making me itch!
Friday night saw me (Tom) a n d D a v e h e a d i n g to that prestigious
v e n u e , T h e E n d . N o r m a l l y , the high price a n d l o n g q u e u e s
w o u l d put us off, but not tonight, o h n o , for we were o n The
G u e s t List. N o t that w o u l d a p p l y to most of you r e a d i n g this, but
it m a k e s things that m u c h sweeter to be ushered in like a VIP.
W a l l of S o u n d rarely fails to impress a n d tonight was no e x c e p -
tion. In T h e B a d M a g i c bar DJ M i g h t y M i couldn't m a k e it, so
was r e p l a c e d by Prime C u t s f r o m the Scratch Perverts. This m a n
d o e s w o n d e r s with two turntables, a n d his mixing a n d s c r a t c h -
ing w e r e t e x t b o o k . T h e c h o i c e of tracks was a little bit l a c k i n g
however, a n d it left m e thirsting for s o m e t h i n g a bit m o r e .
In the M a i n R o o m , DJ T o u c h e f r o m the W i s e g u y s d e l i v e r e d that
bit m o r e . . . a n d e v e n m o r e a n d m o r e ! Flawless m i x i n g of c h o i c e
big beat w h i p p e d the c r o w d into a frenzy. H e even d r o p p e d in
s o m e of his o w n tracks. W h e n O o h La La c a m e o n as the
p e n u l t i m a t e track, f a c e s all a r o u n d lit u p . I t h o u g h t I'd h e a r that
s o n g to d e a t h , but h e a r i n g it e c h o a r o u n d the b a s e m e n t c a v -
erns with a beat so t h u n d e r o u s even T h o r w o u l d be j e a l o u s , I
c o u l d n ' t h e l p l o s i n g it. If The End was a rocket, then DJ T o u c h e
put it into s p a c e . T h e s o u n d system at T h e End is great. It r e a l -
ly k n o c k s y o u off y o u r feet without m a k i n g your ears b l e e d t o o
m u c h .
Unfortunately, the star of the show, Dimitri f r o m Paris wasn't
there. I haven't got a c l u e w h o his r e p l a c e m e n t w a s , but he was
pretty poor, sticking to g e n e r i c d e e p h o u s e with not m u c h to
k e e p y o u interested. If we w a n t that, we'll g o to the Ministry!
B a c k in the B a d M a g i c bar, DJ G r e e n p e a c e was s p i n n i n g the
greatest breaks a r o u n d . This m a n knows his s o u ! , a n d there
was a never a lack of inspiration f r o m his v o l u m i n o u s r e c o r d
box. This was the perfect u p - t e m p o but chilled e n d to the
e v e n i n g . O u r rocket is n o w o r b i t i n g r o u n d M a r s , a n d I think it's
g o i n g to stay there. Until next Friday, of c o u r s e .
This night c o n f i r m e d my o p i n i o n that The End is o n e of the best
c l u b s in L o n d o n . G e t t i n g Prime C u t s as a r e p l a c e m e n t just
s h o w s the sort of p o w e r they have. T h e p l a c e is o p e n until 5 a m
as w e l l , m a k i n g sure that y o u always get y o u r money's w o r t h ,
e v e n for the £1 0 it n o r m a l l y costs to get in. R e c o m m e n d e d !
