As I have said b e f o r e , sport is
extremely i m p o r t a n t t o students.
A n d rightly s o , since it allows the
participant t o d e v e l o p both physi-
cally a n d mentally d u r i n g their time
here. It fosters c o m m u n i t y spirit
("the ability to w o r k in a t e a m " is
s o m e t h i n g w h i c h p r o s p e c t i v e
employers increasingly l o o k f o r in
applicants CVs) a n d it's a great
excuse to k e e p t h e b a r profits
rolling.
S o , given the i m p o r t a n c e o f
such activities, c a n w e at I C c l a i m
to provide a n e n v i r o n m e n t u n d e r
w h i c h s p o r t i n g e x c e l l e n c e is
a l l o w e d t o flourish? W e l l , in o n e
area at least. T h e IC B o a t C l u b
repeatedly proves itself the better of
both O x f o r d a n d C a m b r i d g e (and,
by the way, w e don't have t o bribe
steroid-filled A m e r i c a n s t o c o m e
here a n d row for us). O u r rowers
g a i n g o l d o n the water - a n d in the
e x a m hall - o n their o w n merits.
D o n ' t get me w r o n g , o u r other
sports clubs d o weii e n o u g h within
UL l e a g u e s , but that B o a t C l u b
" e d g e " just isn't there. But wait - I
hear y o u cry - o u r other sports
clubs d o n ' t have the benefit o f p r o -
fessional training facilities such as
the Putney B o a t H o u s e , n o r
O l y m p i c - s t a n d a r d c o a c h e s such as
Bill M a s o n . Exactly. W h i c h is why
I a m surprised that n o b o d y has
ever a s k e d "why n o t ? " .
I'll tell y o u w h y not. T h e true
picture is that I C U , in reality, has
very little control over the B o a t
C l u b . In fact, it only p r o v i d e s
roughly 5 0 % o f its f u n d i n g . T h e
real force driving u p standards o n
the river is Frank Murray, IC's p r o -
fessional Sport & Leisure M a n a g e r .
Since his arrival at IC five-odd
years a g o , Frank has revolutionised
the b o a t c l u b , s p e a r h e a d e d
m a j o r projects a n d s e t a b o u t
u p g r a d i n g sports facilities g e n e r a l -
ly. The boat club's p o o r e r relatives
at I C U , whilst n o t getting a b a d
d e a l by a n y o n e ' s m e a s u r e , simply
d o not have this powerful resource
at their fingertips.
W h i c h is why I'm a b o u t to s u g -
gest s o m e t h i n g a bit r a d i c a l .
L o u g h b o r o u g h University is
r e n o w n e d for the excellence of its
sports t e a m s . This is m a d e possible
by the university's direct f u n d i n g of
an Athletics U n i o n , distinct f r o m
the Students U n i o n : a similar p o s i -
tion to the o n e enjoyed by IC boat
club. Free f r o m the shackles o f
petty student politics, t e a m s c a n
get o n a n d train with top-class
facilities a n d top-class resources.
Surprise surprise, they win. H a b i t u -
ally.
In a w o r l d w h e r e m o r e a n d
m o r e n e w universities are tempting
students t o their h a l l o w e d portals
with b i g g e r a n d better facilities, IC
needs t o r e c o g n i s e that m o r e a n d
m o r e p e o p l e will expect similar
juicy morsels for their £ 1 0 0 0 p.a.
m e m b e r s h i p fee.
Perhaps it's time f o r I C U to
a d m i t d e f e a t . F o r years it h a s
k n o w n that Frank M u r r a y has the
m e a n s to m a k e sport better for all
at Imperial. In short, it is time t o let
the professionals d o their job, a n d
establish a n Athletics U n i o n , with
a n elected student a s its president
(and Frank as its m a n a g e r ) t o r e h a -
bilitate sporting life here at IC.
PRESIDENT PREPARED
As reported o n last w e e k ' s front p a g e o f Felix, the
C & G "Raiders of the Lost Bus" trip to Brighton a n d
its associated antics d i d not g o exactly to plan.
Unfortunately, too m a n y people knew a b o u t the
plot to kidnap U L U President Matt Butt, a n d the
team's attempts were foiled. O n e of those w h o
thought she was in the know was o u r very own
supremo, N a t a s h a . H o w e v e r by the time news of
the plot had reached her presidential suite, details
of the s c a m h a d b e c o m e rather sketchy. O n hear-
ing that a squad was g o i n g to attempt to kidnap
'the president' a n d take t h e m to B r i g h t o n ,
N a t a s h a j u m p e d to the erroneous c o n c l u s i o n she
was the target. Kevin c a n confirm that to avoid
being caught u n p r e p a r e d , on the morning o f the
Brighton Run she was up, dressed, a n d ready to
be snatched before 6 a m . Kevin hears N a t a s h a
was actually looking forward t o a nice relaxing
day at the seaside, a n d w a s thoroughly d i s a p -
pointed when the s q u a d failed to turn up.
MONEY MONEY MONEY
At the latest I C U C o u n c i l the re was a lot of talk o n
the subject of fines, bans, a n d other punitive
penalties that c o u l d really g e t o n your nerves
should you o r your club find themselves o n the
receiving end of them.
C l u b s can now b e fined o r b a n n e d from U n i o n
Facilities if their paperwork is not up to scratch. In
addition the m a x i m u m fine a n d charge that c a n
be i m p o s e d on a student by the disciplinary c o m -
mittee has been reviewed a n d increased: the fine
has g o n e from £100 to £200 a n d the charge
from £1 0 0 to £500. Still o n the topic of fines, the
question of where money raised by fines should
g o was discussed. It was asked if this was a par-
ticularly important point to consider, as surely the
a m o u n t of money raised by fines should b e very
low, as it has been in previous years. N a t a s h a
immediately enthusiastically r e s p o n d e d : "Say if a
Mish
Mash
A Mostly Harmless Column by
Kevin, a random entity who
knows nothing about nothing
whole rugby team c a m e in ... a n d they were fined
fifty quid a h e a d , you could m a k e a fortune."
ERICSSON EXCUSES
Kevin is not happy with the present state of the
Ericsson deal. W h e n Kevin first heard of the d e a l ,
he saw it as a fantastic opportunity to get brilliant,
affordable c o m m u n i c a t i o n s for IC students. A s a
non-apathetic student, Kevin m a d e his opinions
k n o w n to the student representative dealing with
Ericsson, as well a s writing them in his c o l u m n
(come.to/mishmash t o read all Kevin's previous
columns). It is still not too late to resolve the situ-
ation. Ericsson stand to m a k e a huge a m o u n t of
m o n e y from IC in the long term, a n d will not be
put off by a f e w reasonable requests from stu-
dents. Kevin hopes that I C U will not support a
proposal which is significantly less impressive than
that which we should be able to d e m a n d . The lat-
est is that although "Internal calls will b e free,
short c o d e s will not b e in the s a m e way they are
not at the m o m e n t " . Kevin h a d a s s u m e d that
things c o u l d only get better, even he will be
a m a z e d if Ericsson proves to be worse than A C C .
WOW
The n e w Rector, w h o is presently remaining
innominate, has been selected. Kevin c a n confirm
that when their n a m e is a n n o u n c e d , reaction will
be one o n e of: " W o w " . Kevin has also learnt that
the new Rector's wife has already been shown
round the magnificent rectorial residence at 1 7 0
Q u e e n s G a t e , a n d has said she: " Q u i t e likes it."
The Director of Estates was rather disappointed at
this c o m m e n t . Any plans he may have h a d to sell
the architecturally outstanding house he has
recently described as " a nice piece of real estate"
will almost certainly have to b e put o n hold.
