Can't Get Enough
(Nude)
A p p a r e n t l y Brett 'can't
get it up' o r is that just
a witty, m i s - h e a r d lyric?
This is a S u e d e s o n g

Jacques your Body (make me SweaT)
(Wall of Sound)
'Viva le 80s' screams s o m e o n e w h o
didn't actually have the (unfortunate)
experience of actually having the
b l e a c h d r e n c h e d d e n i m a n d truly
bizarre hair, but I love it all the s a m e .
J a c q u e s Le C o n t is usually o n t o p

but the fact that 'Jacques your body1

Knee High
Introducing Elvis
(Mercury)
This s o n g is poor, not
a p p a l i n g but poor. T h e
lyrics are cheesy, 'you
put the s a m e o l d
records o n , a n d y o u
sing a l o n g , yeah y o u
sing a l o n g ' . T h e guitar
work is only just u p to
my o w n l o w s t a n d a r d .
The bass a n d d r u m s
are just so-so but this

Another Day
(Perfecto)
Repeat after m e , 'There is n o such
thing as trance, it is all m e d i a c o n -
c o c t e d spin to sell m a g a z i n e s a n d
C D s . I will s p e n d my m o n e y g o i n g
c l u b b i n g a n d getting drunk instead.'
If y o u say this 5 times a d a y your life
will be better. O a k e n f o l d has played
this stuff for years long before it w a s
ever called trance a n d as this is
released o n his Perfecto label it
s h o u l d be u p to scratch. Another
Day d o e s not d i s a p p o i n t , a n d that's
why this is my single of the week.
D'ception
On The Dancefloord
(48K Records)
This is released o n 4 8 k records, a n
offshoot of Paul O a k e n f o l d ' s Perfecto
label. It is easy to see why this hasn't
been released o n Perfecto as it's only
o n e step away from 2-Unlimited a n d
V e n g a Boys style cheese. It has all
the ingredients of a shit d a n c e
record: cheesy lyrics, a rap a n d slick
production. Luckily it's not at all
catchy so you won't have it playing in
your h e a d over a n d over, but by the
s a m e token you won't be able to sing
a l o n g while drunk in La S c a n d a l e .

mine have a r e a s o n -
able stab at this with a
g o o d musical style, but
the result is far f r o m
interesting. This t h e m e
of dullness but wholly
c o m p e t e n t m u s i c i a n -
ship continues through
the rest of the ER It's
okay, but not really my
kind of thing.
