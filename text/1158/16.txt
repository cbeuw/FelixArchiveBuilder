O k a y , so it's time for m e
a g a i n . A s this short piece
seems to be slowly m o v i n g
from a n introduction to Fre-
quency to a full-on c o l u m n
I'd like to take the o p p o r t u n i -
ty to continue this progres-
sion. I m o a n e d last week
a b o u t p e o p l e c o m p l a i n i n g
a b o u t the music a n d club
sections, a n d as I f o u n d put-
ting my o p i n i o n across w a s so
much f u n , I'd like to d o the
same a g a i n . . .

Alright then - the M i l l e n n i u m ,
a n d as the KLF famously said
- ' W h a t the Fuck is G o i n '
O n ? ' Well I'm still u n d e c i d e d
myself, but w h e n I l o o k e d at
the date the other d a y I felt
my first worry that I w a s leav-
ing the decision t o o late. S o
what are the options? First of
all I suppose I c o u l d spend
the time in a nightclub. Well
that's g o i n g to be expensive.
It's also g o i n g to be a night-
mare organising my mates to
buy s o m e tickets. A n o t h e r
option is just h a n g i n g a r o u n d
the L o n d o n , but if you've ever
hit Trafalgar Square before
you'll k n o w that this is a
nightmare of a n i d e a . S o
what's left? At the m o m e n t
I'm trying to decide between
finding a messy house party
a n d working a n d then s p e n d -

trip to A m s t e r d a m . H o w e v e r if
anyone has any better ideas,
I'd love to hear them. Thanks

The Longpigs
Mobile Home
(Epic)
After three years, T h e Longpigs have finally returned, but the few fans that
they o n c e h a d are n o w running even thinner. S o The Longpigs face the
impossible task of trying to sell a great a l b u m , with very few head-turning
singles, to the masses, without the support of a fan base that similarly-
sized b a n d s (the Bluetones, D o d g y a n d the like) rely u p o n to boost their
sales a n d get themselves noticed a g a i n . Because of this, M o b i l e H o m e ,
a n a l b u m rated as 8 / 1 0 by both NME a n d The Melody Maker has not
even m a d e a dent o n the t o p ten-album chart in its first week of release.
The S u n Is Often Out, The Longpigs debut a l b u m , gave us such near
classics as She Said, Lost Myself a n d the souring O n and On, but since
then, while touring in the US a n d battling that second a l b u m w a l l , all c o n -
tact with them has e v a p o r a t e d . N o public attacks o n other b a n d s o r the
government, n o o u t r a g e o u s rock a n d roll incidents, n o charity gigs o r
even a C D : the lack of a U K a p p e a r a n c e has erased the n a m e of the
Longpigs f r o m the public's memory. Even when lead singer Crispin Hunt
was bottled recently in a gig by his former drummer, they received less
s p a c e in the N M E than the important news that the D a w n of the Repli-
cants were releasing another ER Just writing g o o d music sadly isn't
e n o u g h a n y m o r e .
With a singer as distinctive as Crispin Hunt, it's very hard for a n a l b u m by
the Longpigs not to s o u n d 'longpigsy'; Mobile Homes certainly d o e s . You
c a n really tell f r o m the a l b u m that their time a w a y has been h a r d ; the
music is very moody. N o t a N o Surprises m o o d y , that m a k e s you want to
s l a m your h e a d in the oven a n d d r e a m of glue sticks, he's g o t t o o m u c h
of a point to prove, he's pissed off. Each s o n g has been s o a k e d in the
gut-wrenching passion Hunt displays in the debut a l b u m , with lyrics to
m a t c h . The Frank Sonata, the first f r o m the a l b u m a n d the most likely fol-
low u p single to Blue Skies is far a n d away the best s o n g from the a l b u m
a n d sees the only true return to a guitar-pop tune. They still have the slow
love s o n g s in Baby Blue, their screeching rage in Blue Skies; it is indeed
a well-rounded a l b u m . However, like m a n y before the wait has b e e n t o o
l o n g a n d any h o p e of a successful return has long been buried.
S o here's to T h e Longpigs, m a y they rest in p e a c e . In their memory, here's
s o m e classic lyrics from the n e w a l b u m : 'love like you've never been burnt,
kiss like your t o n g u e is o n fire, suck like you don't need the money, sin
like there's n o b o d y judging, c o s honey if you tried, I'd c o m e running to
you child, like lassies final mile.' Quality.

Major Force West 93-97
(Mo Wax)
This isn't your standard 'grab a bunch of
obscure records, a n d d u m p them o n a
C D ' kind of compilation. While many of
the tracks are doubtless almost impossible
to obtain through normal channels in the
UK, they are all here o n merit, rather than
obscurity. Its difficult to categorise most of
the music o n this a l b u m . Perhaps it's just
e n o u g h to say that it's g o o d . At a push I
would say that most of the tracks could be
described at heavily rewired, beat-led
aural experimentation. W h i c h doesn't real-
ly m e a n anything. It's all got a jazzy feel -
pushing back boundaries with fearsome
building beasts a n d moogish weirdness.
That there is a track with the moniker "Here
c o m e s the Funky M o n k e y " should be
e n o u g h for any Thomas's out there.
This isn't mainstream music. If doesn't real-
ly have lyrics per se, apart from a few
scratched out samples a n d yelps. The
tunes don't really work as background
music - if you have it o n , you listen. There
is a chilled vibe about this collection, none
of the artists featured are in any hurry to
build to a crescendo of noise. Most favour
the a p p r o a c h which sneaks up o n you in its
complexity rather than shocking you out-
right with chaos a n d confusion.
The most enjoyable thing about listening to
this compilation is the way the music takes
you o n a journey. W h e n those instrumen-
tals have you in their grip, your mind w a n -
ders pleasantly, I often found myself visual-
ising things to a c c o m p a n y the music,
which is often like a film score in its style.
Let yourself ease in, a n d g o o n a journey to
the West.
