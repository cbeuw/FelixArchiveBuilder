The Prince of Egypt: Out to Rent or Buy 22/1 1/99
Based o n the Biblical story of M o s e s , The Prince of Egypt
is a n animate d c a p e r by Steven Spielberg's D r e a m w o r k s
Pictures in their latest attempt to dethrone Disney. By tar-
geting adults as well as children the material is both seri-
ous a n d f u n ; a n d also offers great attention to detail. With
a cast including Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, a n d Jeff
G o l d b l u m , it just can't be missed. T h e animation is bril-
liant, particularly the unleashing of the ten plagues. T h e
only weakness is the soundtrack. T h e songs just don't click
in the s a m e w a y as Disney's. This video release loses
s o m e if it's cinematic a w e but is still worthwhile viewing.

Life is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella): O u t to Rent 2 2 / 1 1 / 9 9
This is the story of a n Italian Jewish family in the years
leading u p to a n d including the S e c o n d W o r l d War. T h e
film is split into two juxtaposed halves. T h e beginning is a
light slapstick, which covers the happy times when waiter
G u i d o (Roberto Benigni, w h o also directs) courts s c h o o l -
teacher D o r a (Nicoletta Braschi). In c o m p a r i s o n the sec-
o n d half is shocking as G u i d o , D o r a a n d their young s o n
J o s h u a ( G i o r g i o Cantarini) are taken to prison c a m p s .
G u i d o n o w uses his tomfoolery to protect his son. It is this
that gives it a different perspective to previous holocaust
films. (4/5) •

She's All That: O u t to Rent 22/1 1/99
This is yet another teen movie churned out from Holly-
wood's production line. W h a t does it offer beyond what's
c o m e before? Very little I'm afraid. The most p o p u l a r guy
on c a m p u s , Z a c k Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr.), bets a mate the
he c a n turn the school geek, Laney Bogs (Rachel Leigh
C o o k ) , complete with her big boffin glasses, into the Prom
Q u e e n . The rest is obvious. Bogs loses the glasses, is sud-
denly beautiful a n d Siler falls in love. T h e p r o b l e m is y o u
just can't help but get involved although most of the jokes
fall flat. In the e n d , it is just a n average teen flick with a
hip soundtrack a n d a happy ending. (3/5)
