The Times They Are A-Changin'
Come gather 'round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times are a-changin'.
Are you ready for the
Digital Age?
What's the story...
B o b Dylan h a s p r o b a b l y c a u g h t the Zeitgeist o f
the a g e better than most. His lyrics a r e truer n o w
than w h e n they were p e n n e d in 1 9 6 3 . W h a t is
the i d e a of this n e w business section? S i m p l e . If
you a r e r e a d i n g this article then y o u a r e p r o b a -
bly a student at IC, w h i c h is o n e of the better
technical a n d scientific universities in the country.
It has a n international reputation. S o w h a t ? This
c o l u m n p r o p o s e s that o f all the universities in the
country, IC is best p o i s e d t o take a d v a n t a g e o f
turning its intellectual c a p i t a l into t h e basis f o r
w o r l d class c o m p a n i e s .
Looking across the pond
The first question that needs t o b e a n s w e r e d is
c a n Britain c o m p e t e with the 8 0 0 1 b gorilla of the
world e c o n o m y : the g o o d o l ' U S of A ? Let's just
list s o m e w o r l d class A m e r i c a n technical univer-
sities: M I T ; Texas A & M ; S t a n f o r d ; C a l t e c h ;
Berkley. Pick a n y o n e o f these: Stanford say. In
the past 2 0 years here a r e s o m e c o m p a n i e s , that
you might have h e a r d of, that h a d there roots in
this institution: S u n ; Silicon G r a p h i c s ; Y a h o o ;
A m a z o n ; C i s c o .
The list g o e s o n . A n interesting exercise t o
d o , is t o get a c o p y o f the Financial Times, look
at the N a s d a q share prices p a g e a n d calculate
the c o m b i n e d v a l u e o f these c o m p a n i e s . I c h a l -
lenge a n y o n e to n a m e a E u r o p e a n university that
has p r o d u c e d s o m a n y v a l u a b l e c o m p a n i e s in
the past twenty years.
The twenty year test
I picked twenty years b e c a u s e it is a n u m b e r that
is easy to relate t o , it's p r o b a b l y a b o u t the m e a n
a g e of a n IC u n d e r g r a d . In twenty years time
m a n y o f us will b e in o u r forties, o r thereabouts.
H o w m a n y billion d o l l a r c o m p a n i e s d o y o u think
will b e created as a result o f a direct a s s o c i a t i o n
with I C ? Feel free t o e m a i l Felix with your
answers.
However, if y o u stretch the b o u n d a r i e s of this
little exercise it will include c o m p a n i e s like Intel
a n d Hewlett-Packard, a n d the c o m b i n e d value
starts t o look silly.
The profit motive
The historians of the a g e will p r o b a b l y focus o n
the exploits of m e n a n d w o m e n o f scientific
genius, citing n a m e s such as Lovelace, B a b -
b a g e , Turing, v o n N e u m a n n , a n d Cray. That's
p r o b a b l y why I a m not a historian. Don't m i s u n -
derstand m e I respect a l l of the a b o v e hugely,
a n d I'm sure there a r e p e o p l e of their calibre
a m o n g s t o u r g e ne r a tion at IC. But while science
is the fuel o f progress, business h a s a n d always
will b e , the e n g i n e o f progress. W h o doesn't
w a n t to m a k e a profit? Be it a n i n d i v i d u a l , c o m -
pany, institution o r country. It is the profit motive
that h a s driven the shift f r o m M a c h i n e A g e to
Digital A g e a n d to whatever a g e c o m e s next.
M a y b e even Internet A g e ? A n d it h a s b e e n a n
epic shift.
W h a t bugs m e is h o w little a d v a n t a g e IC
(institution, students a n d lecuters) h a s taken of
the c h a n g e s in the g l o b a l e c o n o m y , especially
the c o m m e r c i a l i s a t i o n o f the internet. After a l l ,
the W o r l d W i d e W e b w a s created just d o w n the
r o a d by a U C L lecturer. This c o l u m n has a
healthy scepticsim a b o u t the rate at which
E u r o p e is p r o d u c i n g world beating high tech
c o m p a n i e s . H a v e y o u heard the story of Darryl
M a t t o c k s ?
Darryl who?
Six years a g o t w o guys in their early thirties,
independently h a d the s a m e i d e a . O n e o f them
was in Seattle the other in O x f o r d . They both set
up w h a t e a c h c l a i m e d t o b e the world's biggest
on-line b o o k s t o r e . Both listed a r o u n d a million
b o o k s , both were equally accessible f r o m any-
w h e r e in the w o r l d , a n d both offered similar
services f o r customers, such as e-mail notifica-
tion w h e n a n e w b o o k by a favourite author h a d
arrived. In theory this s h o u l d have b e e n a classic
e x a m p l e of h o w the internet w o u l d m a k e a n o n -
sense o f g e o g r a p h y ? W r o n g .
You k n o w the story a b o u t the other g u y p r o b -
ably better than I d o . W h o is h e ? Jeff Bezos,
everyone's favourite internet billionaire. W h a t
h a p p e n e d to Darryl y o u m a y ask? W e l l , he d i d -
n't d o t o o badly I s u p p o s e : he sold out f o r a b o u t
two million p o u n d s .
This case study is a salutary lesson f o r any-
o n e out there c o n s i d e r i n g starting their o w n high
t e c h b u s i n e s s . Let's p r o p o s e t h e f o l l o w i n g
hypothesis: f o r a n y given high tech i d e a , with
everything else being e q u a l , it is a heck of a sight
easier t o turn it into a market l e a d i n g business
proposition in the U S than outside of it. This is
not to say it is i m p o s s i b l e but f o r practical pur-
poses the distinction seems slight. This c o l u m n
will seek t o explore the reasons this a p p e a r s to
be the case. T h e g o v e r n m e n t is s o c o n c e r n e d
that it p u b l i s h e d a hefty e - c o m m e r c e study this
s u m m e r
E is good
O p e n any newspaper, watch any T V c h a n n e l , lis-
ten to a n y radio station a n d y o u will b e b o m -
b a r d e d a b o u t ' e - c o m m e r c e ' . Q u i t e a lot of the
talk is rubbish. T h e truth a b o u t e - c o m m e r c e at
the m o m e n t is that very f e w c o m p a n i e s k n o w
h o w to m a k e a profit using it. H e n c e the wealth
of views, articles a n d o p i n i o n s . It is often a case
of the blind l e a d i n g the blind. Here's a n i d e a , if
you w a n t to m a k e a lot c a s h b e c o m e a n e - c o m -
merce consultant. A t times of c o n f u s i o n a n d
uncertainty p e o p l e seek certainty. H e n c e a n y
'visionary' w h o states his c a s e c o n v i n c i n g l y
e n o u g h will b e h e a r d t h r o u g h the noise. W h o is
the Henry Ford of the Internet a g e ? There a f e w
potential c a n d i d a t e s out there a n d this c o l u m n
will seek to separate the w h e a t f r o m the chaff.
It's the economics, stupid
H a v i n g a bright i d e a , o r a killer a p p l i c a t i o n in
the current l i n g o , o r b e i n g the smartest person
o n the planet c a n actually count f o r surprisingly
little. N o t even the biggest country in the world
c a n defy the laws of e c o n o m i c s , let a l o n e a n y
o n e individual. From the business perspective,
the internet has not yet destroyed distance as the
b o o k s e l l i n g e x a m p l e shows.
A n o t h e r area that this c o l u m n intends to
explore is w h a t infrastructure is required to give
Imperial a competitive a d v a n t a g e . It boils d o w n
to why is there not a n equivalent t o Silicon V a l -
ley here. There have b e e n m u r m u r i n g s a b o u t Sil-
icon F e n , a n d it is certainly a potential c o m p e t i -
tor to a n y L o n d o n b a s e d high tech centre.The
point c a n b e illustrated by stating a n extreme
e x a m p l e . A n A f r i c a n t e e n a g e r with the smartest
internet i d e a is not g o i n g t o get very far, if he is
stuck in his village.
Kick off
This c o l u m n will kick off with series o f articles
profiling of a f o r m e r Imperial P h D student a n d
o n e t i m e lecturer, w h o I like to think of as the Bil-
lion D o l l a r D o c . W a t c h this s p a c e .
