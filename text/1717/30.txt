“Taking
dancers of
all levels and
turning them
into the next
Madhuri Dixit,
our dance
performances
are not to be
missed”
longest running student show in the country - East
Dance
Every year EMW dance
acts have been highly
anticipated and this year
is no different. Taking
dancers of all levels and
turning them into the next
Madhuri Dixit, our dance
performances are not to be
missed.
With a fusion of
gaana, contemporary,
Bollywood, Hip-Hop,
Street, Bhangra and more,
finding a more varied set
than RAABTA is no mean
feat. Choreographers
Kanav Agarwal, Maya
Satheeskaran, and Ajitha
Sundaram shared that
their “mixture of students
from first year to third
year shows how universal
EMW really is.”
MASTANI is a
stunning mix of Bolly-
wood, hip-hop, classical
and Latin, with an equally
diverse music mix. Fol-
lowing the breathtaking
story of Mastani as they
travel through the ages,
the group, choreographed
by Devyani Saini, Shivani
Kalair and Mohona
Sengupta, will be astound-
ing the audience with their
tale of three women over
three eras.
DRISHTI amazed
hundreds all the way back
in January at Hindu soci-
ety’s Winter Mela. Their
dance, choreographed
by Rajas Barve, Manu
Pillai, Arunima Basu and
Paridhi Poddhar, is made
up of 19 performers, the
majority of whom are
trained in Bharatanatyam
or Kathak dance. Drishti
will be bringing you all a
beautiful combination of
traditional dance styles,
partnered with a mix
containing the most un-
believable range of songs,
bringing to life an incred-
ible performance which
will redefine ‘classical’
for future generations.
Music
Directed by Sreya
Coomer, Music is
bringing you anything and
everything you could ever
imagine hearing in just
five acts: from RAPPING
and BEATBOXING
mixed with some tuneful
melodies, to a CHOIR
singing a medley of
showstopping Hindi and
English songs which are
sure to leave you with a
smile on your face. The
two band acts will leave
you with an irresistible
urge to tap your feet along
to the music, whilst their
DUET will leave you
feeling all kinds of moods
– emotional, romantic,
happy, and “just can’t
help but dance and sing
along”!
Fashion
The catwalk highlights
some of the most outstand-
ing outfits, designed and
supplied by our fantastic
sponsors. All the featured
outfits in this year’s shows
are courtesy of NV Col-
lections, VR Sarees, Fa-
bilicious Fashion, Prachy
Creations and Pagh Vala.
Our student models will
be displaying five key
themes on stage:
The first two themes
of the fashion show are
‘Boys’ and ‘Girls’. Cel-
ebrating what the whole
show is about, the models
will be integrating western
and Indian culture, show-
casing traditional formal
wear from all corners of
the globe.
Third, our models will
be exploring the theme
of ‘Wedding’. Exhibiting
jaw dropping bridal
wear, these grand outfits
will leave the audience
enthralled. Next ‘Fusion’
uses the medium of
clothing to celebrate all
cultures and their differ-
ences. Finally, bringing it
home, ‘All Around India’
investigates the varied
styles of fashion across
our diverse motherland.
The choreography that
brings these exquisite
pieces of clothing to
light is brought to you by
Aakriti Shah, Meha Vora
and Amar Rai.

KNIGHTSBRIDGE: the
story of Jay and Sam,
two clueless cops who
are sent undercover to
Imperial College London
to investigate the mys-
terious emergence of
a rogue circle in South
Kensington, dealing a
new brand of Imperial’s
most addictive substance:
Curly Fries… a strain so
popular it’s driving the
Union out of business.
Their mission is simple:
“Infiltrate the dealers, find
the supplier.”
In a story of thrilling
adventure, captivating
romance and shocking
twists and turns, our
favourite detectives will
soon find there is more
going on than meets the
eye. Thrown back into
university life, they must
navigate through the
tricky world of lectures,

and girls as they continue
their mission. Will they
succeed? Or will their
efforts result in paying the
ultimate price?

urrently cel-
ebrating its
27th
year, East
Meets West is an
eclectic fusion of dance,
drama, fashion and music.
It incorporates artistic
elements and styles from
cultures and traditions
across the world to create a
vibrant and unforgettable
evening of entertainment.
In 1992, East Meets
West was established
as a simple platform to
showcase the diverse
talent at Imperial. Twen-
ty-seven years later, it has
grown to be one of the
most highly anticipated
university shows in the
country, gracing venues
such as Eventim Apollo,
London Palladium and the
Novello Theatre.
EMW has reached
amazing new heights
this year. We’ve had
the blessing of hosting
a record-breaking 230
auditions, including
performers from other
London universities such
as Kings and the Royal
Veterinary College. From
the introduction of a choir
act, to the fusion of more
dance styles than we’ve
ever featured before,
we continue to strive to
deliver that which has
never been done before.
