Last night I dreamt of Boipeba
The Brazilian biosphere reserve battling for its UNESCO protected status

“Boipeba is
a paradise
of ecological
diversity”
I
hesitate to utter the
word “Bahia”. Bah-
eee-yah. It’s beautiful
to say it aloud. Also
known by its epithet,
the “land of happiness”,
Bahia is a vibrant state
in Northeastern Brazil
that for whatever reason
has managed to evade
many a Latin America
travel itinerary. My hes-
itation to utter the word
is in part because of this:
what makes the region so
special is its unrivalled
beauty, twinned with the
fact that it still remains in
relative obscurity to much
of the international com-
munity. Until now, Bahia
has retained so much of
its rich cultural heritage,
protected national parks,
and beautiful coastlines
that have not suffered the
fates of Bali and Goa. I
hope that it can continue
to do so, and that to utter
the word is not to let the
cat too far out of the bag.
While it is home to the
biggest – and arguably
best – carnival in the
world, in the state capital
of Salvador, Bahia is
perhaps most known for
its beaches. Those making
the pilgrimage up from
or down to Rio gener-
ally do so at a laid-back
Brazilian pace, hopping
from secluded spot to
secluded spot, with plenty
of fresh fruits including
hydrating coconuts to
accompany the journey
along the coast. To the
cynic, the never-ending
coastline may seem like
much of a muchness, but
there are some gems to be
found that truly stand out.
Boipeba is one such place,
atinyislandtuckedagainst
the shore just a few hours
south of Salvador. Despite
its relative proximity, it is
hard to imagine that the
island even occupies the
same state as the bustling
city. Boipeba moves to
a different beat. Just ask
anyone who has been
about the energy or the
vibe, and they’ll tell you.
But be prepared for a long,
meandering monologue of
inexplicable details that
will never compare to the
joy of experiencing it for
yourself. Named after the
sea turtles that populate
its coastlines, Boipeba is
a paradise of ecological
diversity. Home to rich
Atlantic rainforest ripe
for inland hiking trails,
secluded beach spots
framed by boulders and
swaying palms, and a
massive mangrove forest
best navigated by kayak,
the island has plenty to
keep you entertained for
a sleepy yet action-packed
Brazilian getaway. Oh,
and the coast is also sprin-
kled with natural pools
boasting colourful corals
and marine life, when you
need to escape that intense
midday heat. While that
might sound like any other
island paradise, there are a
few standout features that
make Boipeba a unique
gem within Brazil. For
starters, you can leave any
safety concerns back at the
mainland docks. Although
the nation has seen a surge
in crime in recent years,
the island is composed of
small villages in which
everyone knows every-
one, and visitors are free
to walk through the night
and day, comfortably
carrying phones, cameras,
and cash – a luxury that
cannot be said about
the mainland. While the
children of the west have
been relegated to dark
rooms and smartphone
screens, the kids of
Boipeba are out in force
as much as the island’s
population of friendly,
community-owned pups,
making the most of the
sun and sand. It’s refresh-
ing to visit a place where
people still know their
neighbours and make an
effort to keep the sense
of community that much
of the world has lost. It is
that sense of community
that binds the people of
Boipeba to one another,
and to their home. The
island is bestowed with
world heritage status from
UNESCO, an accolade
that its people wear
with pride and are apt
to maintain. Motorised
vehicles are banned from
the island, with visitors
instead relying on old
fashioned tractors – or
their own trusty feet – to
shuttle them across the
island. With many of the
community still relying
on traditional agricultural
and fishing methods for
their livelihoods, it is im-
portant that development
on the island is kept in
check, and not allowed
to interfere with local
customs. Amabo, the
Association of Residents
and Friends of Boipeba,
was founded to protect
the life of residents and
the local environment, as
well as educating people
on the conWWtemporary
issues at play. It is just
one of the groups that are
protecting that coveted
UNESCO status. With the
constant threat of interna-
tional developers intent
on building resorts on the
island, groups like Amabo
play an important role
in the discussion. While
the would-be developers
argue that the island be-
longs to Brazil and is fair
game for acquisition and
development to help bol-
ster the nation’s economy,
residents and conserva-
tion groups take the view
that the island’s delicate
ecosystems belong to all
of humanity and cannot
be decimated in the name
of capital and growth.

With a little help from
a team of dedicated
pro bono lawyers, the
residents and friends of
Boipeba have – for now
at least – managed to keep
unwanted, unsustainable
resort development at
bay. But with President
Bolsonaro intent on
opening the nation to
international investment,
with little regard to the
delicate ecosystems worth
fighting to maintain, the
security of Boipeba’s
UNESCO status – and
the livelihoods of its
residents – is still under
threat. In this regard,
Boipeba Island becomes
a symbol to which we
can all relate, and its fight
for sustainability a cause
we can all get behind.
Whether it’s a faraway
tropical island, an even
farther polar glacier, or a
beloved woodland by our
own backyard, we know
that it is worth standing
up for voiceless entities,
against capitalist growth.
That way our planet may
retain its balance and
beauty – indeed, remain a
place on which we all can
live – for many years to
come.
A tale of two
towns:
No trip to Boipeba would
be complete without
ample exploration of its
two famed villages, Velha
Boipeba and Moreré. To
help you better understand
the island and community
while keeping in line
with sustainable ideals,
to understand family life
on the island, which will
probably include drop-in
visits from some of the
local children looking for
a fresh juice made from
fine fruits you’ve probably
never heard of, and some
of the local hummingbirds
on their morning flight.
The family are happy to
help make your stay as
much as they help the
local community, offering
guidance on places to
walk and where to eat.
Perhaps most importantly,
Fernando is a talented
chocolatier creating
a range of delicious
products using fresh-
ly-picked cacau, as well
as teaching local children
about his craft. Do not
leave without sampling
some of the tasty treats on
offer, and taking some for
the road.
Casa Bobo: Instagram
@EcoCasaBobo. Perched
from a terrific vantage
point above Moreré and
neighbouring Bainema
beach sits the island’s top
rated eco pousada. The
reputation that couple
Myriam and Nilton have
built up over the years is
legendary, with plenty of
awards and reviews that
speak for themselves.
Casa Bobo is a set of
three gorgeous bunga-
lows constructed using
locally-sourced labour
and materials, with beau-
tiful communal spaces
to enjoy both sunrise
and sunset. Worthy of its
eco pousada title, Casa
Bobo is involved in many
sustainability projects:
providing space to build
much-needed water
tanks, donating materials
to university recycling
programs, and organising
regular beach cleanups.
They are also on the front-
lines of the ongoing battle
to protect the island’s
UNESCO status. And
then there’s the wonderful
selection of food, freshly
prepared with ingredients
sourced from the ranch’s
stunning gardens, laying
to rest the idea that Brazil
can’t deliver gastronomy.
With Myriam on breakfast
duties, and Nilton’s sunset
bar whipping up tasty acai
bowls, caipirinhas, and
grilled fish, you are in the
safest of hands. Oh, and
you’ll also find a selection
of Fernando’s treats avail-
able at the mini bar.Above
all, Casa Bobo is a place
filled with love. Love for
the island, support for its
local businesses, and an
unforgettable experience
for any visitor lucky
enough to bag a bungalow
for a few days.

Boipeba community curb
unsustainable develop-
ment on the island by
