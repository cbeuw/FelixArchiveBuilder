Fromsinglecellstomulticellularorganisms:witnessing
evolution
R
esearchers from
the George
Institute of
Technology and
University of Montana
have witnessed in re-
al-time the development
of single-cell algae into
more complex multicel-
lular organisms – and,
astonishingly, the process
took only 50 weeks, or
just 750 generations. The
only driving environmen-
tal factor was predation
by another simple, sin-
gle-celled organism.
The research resulted
from a relatively new
approach to investigating
the transition from unicel-
lular to multicellular life.
As opposed to retrospec-
tive approaches, which
rely on incomplete fossil
records and comparing
more recent multicellular
to distantly-related extant
unicellular organisms, this
“experimental evolution”
is more prospective in
style.
Two of the five ex-
perimental populations
evolved into multicellular
life – and both showed a
high degree of variance in
their traits and life cycles,
within each population
and between the two.
As evolution works on
the basis of beneficial
mutations becoming nor-
malised over a population
over multiple life cycles,
this is exactly what one
would expect; however,
witnessing it develop in
real-time is an exhilarat-
ing development.
The reason the
mutation into larger,
multicellular organisms
was beneficial is that, like
many predators, the filter
predator used (Brachionus
calyciflorus) can only
prey on a narrow range
of sizes, referred to as the
“predation threshold”;
larger organisms, in this
case the evolved multi-
cellular algae, are largely
immune.
Key to note is that the
algae (Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii) displays
a tendency to form
palmelloids under certain
conditions, which are
globs of divided cells
resulting either from
daughter cells failing to
break free of the cell wall
upon division, or the cells
producing a gelatinous or
mucilaginous substance
which then cements them
together. The unicellular
algae therefore already
had access to “a toolkit for
producing multicellular
structures”, although an
“optional” one as opposed
to the evolved form’s
obligate multicellular
structure.
That this response
occurred purely in
response to predation,
with no other selective
pressures, shows that
predation likely played
some part in the initial
evolutionary leaps to mul-
ticellular life - leaps that
eventually culminated in
complex organisms like
humans.
It also produced some
stunning timelapses,
viewable on the original
article in Nature.
Infectious diseases could be diagnosed with
smartphones in sub-Saharan Africa

A
new Imperial-
led review has
outlined how
health workers
could use existing phones
to predict and curb the
spread of infectious
diseases.
The review was pub-
lished in Nature, and
involved researchers
from Imperial, the Kar-
olinska Institute, UCL,
The University of Kwa-
Zulu-Natal, the Africa
Health Research Institute,
and the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine. It outlines
how healthcare workers
in low-income countries,
like those in sub-Saharan
Africa, could use existing
smartphones to diagnose,
track and control infec-
tious diseases.
It also says that
smartphones could also
help enable people to
test themselves and get
results and support in
their own homes. This
would make it easier for
people to look after their
own health - particularly
in rural regions, where
clinics can be very distant.
For example, patients
worried about a potential
HIV infection might be
more inclined to get tested
if they could do it at home
and avoid the stigma of
attending a clinic.
Many smartphones
have sensors built in that
could aid diagnosis, such
as a heart rate monitor and
an oximeter, as well as a
camera and microphone
that can be used to analyse
images and sounds like a
person’s breathing.
In addition, simple
testing technologies are
being developed that can
be linked into a phone, via
a USB stick or wirelessly.
In theory, a person could
test themselves using an
easy to collect sample,
such as a pinprick of
blood, and the results
would be scanned onto
mobile apps. Approaches
outlined in the review
include apps that use
the phone’s camera to
interpret test results, send
findings to local clinics
or healthcare workers,
and host virtual follow-up
appointments with health-
care workers.
Combined, the test
results would then build
a picture of symptoms
across a region to help
predict and fight current
and future outbreaks.
The authors add that
these ideas are not without
challenges. Although
rapid technological
advances have improved
access to testing, more
than 35 percent of the
world does not have
access to mobile phones.
It is also easier to accu-
rately collect and analyse
samples in a healthcare
setting, where there are
trained staff and the envi-
ronment is designed to be
sterile, than in a person’s
home.
Furthermore, safe-
guarding measures must
be put in place to protect
the privacy and confi-
dentiality of patient data,
the authors say. These
measures must also be
fully explained to users to
build trust in and encour-
age adoption of these new
healthcare services.
Still, the report’s
authors remain optimis-
tic. As of 2016, global
smartphone adoption has
reached 51 percent and is
predicted to keep growing
- particularly in resource
limited settings such
as sub-Saharan Africa.
The potential to develop
these powerful new tools
in diagnosis and disease
outbreak predictions is
only growing.
