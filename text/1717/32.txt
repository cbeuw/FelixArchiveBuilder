Marcus Buchanan
Dear men AND WOMEN (you can’t
be too careful these days), my name is
Jonathan Risbit, and I am a the only
candidate in this field of pansies and
lip wristed nobodies that you can rely
on bringing you a Union that you can
be proud of. I don’t want to be Presi-
dent of a Union that I have to lie about
at family barbeques. I want to be able
to hold my head up high and show my
Union to everyone.
I, Marcus Buchanan to the people,
For too long now have we the student
body been denied a voice, a seat at the
table, a foot in the door and as a leg to
stand on. As a result we as a body have
been crippled.
There is but one solution for this - our
students must have access to ‘Directest
DemocracyTM’
. My new system would
hold Council to account by giving a
seat on a Sub-committee to all new

Blessings!
My name is Sarah Billsflower, a second
year Geologist and amateur Wicca
practitioner. I believe it is my desti-
ny to lead the NegaFelix team into a
glorious dawn.
As NegaFelix editor I will change the
paper to be handwritten on leaves in
order to avoid toxic computers. As the

students. Nothing will be beyond our
power; from deciding whether to sell
beer in SI unit glasses, to ensuring the
shrubs outside the Union are fairly
representative of colour and species.
I propose that any students with more
than 1% of their year group’s support
will be given veto power on any and
every decision made at Imperial.
Finally, I will force through a restruc-
ture of Union Council, making it the
decision-making body it was meant
to be, rather than just a place for loud
pedants to shout at each other.
On top of this we will hold com-
pulsory referendums each week to
ensure that the student community is
adequately heard.
When we the students band together,
the mighty quake and the mildly racist
tremble.
I see my role as a simple one. To go
into the sulphurous pit of the Un-
ion offices and to purge the daemon
from it so that you don’t have to. My
credentials for this sort of exercise are
unparalleled. I managed to get myself
elected Social Secretary for the Model
Trains Society and only 3 months later
it was raided by the fascist Communist
Union staff and closed for financial
misconduct. Just imagine what this
level of being able to screw something
up for other people could do when
leveraged properly…
So I want you to look to either side of
you. Would you trust any of the people
standing next to you to stand up to the
leftist nonsense being forced down our
throats, or would you rather I put your
faith in me - Jonathan Thomas Risbit.
P.S. I would also erect a statue to
Churchill - a true British hero
most important subject, the Sustaina-
bility section will occupy the first ten
pages of the paper (leaf) every week.
Centerfolds will Wbe printed as cave
paintings on the side of Beit Quad.
We will, however, keep the investment
section, in order to help my career
in management consultancy - firing
people is green, right? I won’t write
anything else, it’s a waste of ink.

昨晚深夜，当我们在Felix办公室
写这篇文章时，想不出更多讽刺内
容，我们想出了这个我们认为很幽
默的注意。
我们当时都呵呵大笑。说真的，我
们当时觉得这实在是太幽默，我们
甚至邀请了我们的一个记者来编辑
这一段话。
然后我们又狂笑了一趟。
Dear All,
My name is Gavin Golden-Ballsacks
and I am a final year Mechanical Engineer-
ing student at Imperial College London. I
am writing to you today to apply for the
position of Union President as advertised
on your website.
I see the major flaw in the Union being
its monopoly on student activities. In order
to drive improvement in student services
and reduce cost, through the application of

看出我们当时一个绝望到荒唐可

Union办公室提出。
free market economics. I plan to privatise
the Union and open it up to tender.
Additionally, I will open sponsorship
opportunities for key Union services. For
example, 568 to be renamed the Emirates
bar; the Union Counselling brought to you
by BAE Systems; and the Union Concert
Hall - presented by Huawei.
I propose a hostile takeover of DramSoc,
in order to seize the means of production.
I will continue the authoritarian rule of
CSPB and streamline the process by
sacking the other members of the board.
I will also dissolve Union Council; it’s a
waste of time anyway.
I have had experience in a secured
experience for the role during my spring
week at my Father’s consultancy firm.
Please find attached my curriculum
vitae for further reference.
Yours sincerely,
Gavin Golden-Ballsacks

Speaking to the women in the crowd
here - any of you ever get fed up with
the poor quality of men here?
It’s like I am dying of thirst and people
keep handing me glasses of piss, know
what I mean?
So here is my plan. We need to put
temporary bans in place to screen out
the undesirable populations. Below is
my proposed list of banned groups:
Fran Strated
- Northerners for not being able to
speak English properly (that includes
the Scottish)
- South Westerners for all being racist
- Londoners for being members of the
liberal metropolitan elite
- Southerners who are too far up their
own arse.
- Anyone from the East, see South
West.
- I’d make a joke about the Welsh but
it would be just the pits.
Further consultation has led to the
addition of those who do not own
trousers that cover the shin and any-
one that uses a j when laughing in a
text message.
When I get elected I will have an open
door policy and we will operate a
process of constant review to see who
else should be added to the undesira-
ble lists.
