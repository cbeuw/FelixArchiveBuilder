Imperial College Conquers Closely Contested
Championship
I
mperial returns to
the Velopark in
Stratford, London for
the inaugural London
Universities Duathlon
Championships.
Pre-race prep included:
gawking at the com-
petition’s incredibly
expensive bikes; going
to the toilet and putting
on a trisuit in the wrong
order; debating over the
optimum bike racking
position in the transition
area and some compul-
sory pre-race gossip. Oh,
and a warm-up too.
The race itself consisted
of a 2 mile run, followed
by a 10 mile bike and then
another 1 mile run. So in
total 13 laps of the circuit
(1 lap = 1 mile) and two
transitions. The race was
non-drafting, meaning
that one can’t use another
cyclist as a wind break.
The race started with
the running leg where
Mark Pollock and Matt
Ryan took an early lead,
both looking like strong
podium contenders. Matt
looked like a pro on the
bike (especially when
compared to people riding
folding bikes), and he had
the power to match. When
coming in for his 10th
lap,
clearly all his blood had
gone from his brain to his
legs, as it was at this point
that he decided that he had
only done 9 laps and went
for his 10th
(actually 11th
).
While it was all very funny
that Matt couldn’t count
(many, many DesEng
jokes were made) it did
have the very unfortunate
consequence of losing
him a likely podium
finish. Angus “no pain
face” Phillips was a very
strong all-rounder and
made it through in a rapid
time. Meanwhile Esme
was dragging herself
through new limits of pain
never before experienced,
even on an erg. Alex was
dreaming of coffee shops,
and Jacob would rather
have been in ICCC kit.
Due to excellent efforts
all round from Matt Ryan,
Mark Pollock, Angus
Phillips, Alex Luisi, Esme
Hotson-Moore and Jacob
Kay, Imperial won the
inaugural London Univer-
sities Individual Duathlon
Championships. Rumour
has it that we won by
default. These claims
have yet to be verified.
Well-earnt post-race
cake was shared around
and we proceeded to
spectate the rest of the
field coming in. We all
concluded that greatest
respect was to be had for
the man who finished last,
as he was likely twice
the age of the next oldest
competitor. Definite
elderly goals.
The day had turned
out to be truly delightful
so cycling home was
deemed the most pleasant
option. Despite going
right through the middle
of London, the group
enjoyed the ride home
and the strava captions in
particular indicated that
the group thought [the
author] was a particularly
good tour guide. The
author has refuted this
claim.
IC Dance Club: Best Victory in 2 Decades
I
was ~3 months old
when Imperial last
won Best A Team at
Blackpool. Now I
am 237 months old and
Imperial has at last done
it again, vanquishing the
titans of Cambridge.
It all started on a sunny
Friday afternoon when
62 dancers embarked on
a long, slow coach ride
to the home of Ballroom.
With sprayed hair and
fake tans, we arrived at
midnight having tested
our knowledge of halide
tests and reverse Disney
songs.
But before we knew
it, it was time to get up,
as bright-eyed and bushy-
tailed as we could possibly
be. The Winter Gardens
were opening at 8am
and we wanted as much
practice time as possible.
The Winter Gardens is
where the oldest Ballroom
dance competition takes
place and is probably
the world’s most famous
ballroom.
Foxtrot and Quickstep).
To succeed here you need
a strong frame, floor craft
skills and the ability to
make everything appear
effortless. In the inter-
mediate 3-dance Henry
Heston&SarahMcMullan
came 4th
and Ben Biggs &
Katie Moorcroft came 6th
out of 56 couples. In the
ex-student novice 2-dance
Matthew Abdul-Rahim &
Yue Shi came 4th
, Carsten
Beck & Priyanka Shah
came 5th
and Alex Beddall
& Slavina Georgieva
came 7th
. Finally, in the
advanced 4-dance Victor
Solecki & Iris Roatis
came 6th
.
Post lunch came Latin
American along with a
shift in gears. The five
Latin dances (Cha Cha,
Samba, Rumba, Paso
Doble and Jive) are where
you shake your hips and
flick your feet… as well
as the occasional body
roll. In the beginners
Jive, Sony Saint-Auret &
Yingyi Wang came 6th
out
of over 160 couples. In the
ex-student 2-dance Alex
Beddall & Lily Keeling
came 2nd
and Aizar Enciso
Dominguez & Izumi
Kurokawa came 5th
. In the
ex-student 5-dance, Tianci
Ma & Kerys Borg came 3rd
and Philip Kaloyanov &
Daria Dicu came 5th
. Last
but by no means least was
the advanced 4-dance,
where Matthew Cavuto
& Mariya Pozdeyeva won
and Teodor Rusu & Maya
Thomas came 7th
.

in
the intermediate category.

Overall everybody in
the Dance Club should
be incredibly proud of
their collective achieve-

and the after party wasn’t
bad either.

team match began. Waltz,
Cha Cha, Quickstep and
Jive would be performed
by 4 different couples as
a single team. It was as a

coming into our own. The

teams both came 3rd

their respective dances.
The B team were crowned
