is an American
h i g h - s c h o o l
senior who, on Tuesday,
testified before the US
Senate Committee on
Health, Education, Labor
and Pensions. He got
himself vaccinated after
asking on Reddit how to
do so against the wishes
of his anti-vax mother.
In his testimony, he at-
tributed his mother’s mis-
information to anecdotal
guidance from Facebook
and church. His mother
believes vaccines cause
severe side-effects such as
autism or permanent brain
damage.

proving its link to autism,
how is there still room for
debate?
severe allergic reaction)
induced by a vaccine is 1
in a 1,000,000. The risk
of dying in a car crash,
however, is 1 in 303.
And before the measles
vaccine was introduced,
measles infected 4 million
Americans every year.
The arguments get
more complicated and dif-
ficult to rebuff from here.
Most anti-vax parents
refuse to vaccinate their
child out of genuine
concern and suspicion
- they believe the risk
of vaccination is higher
than the risk of catching
a vaccine-preventable
disease. It’s an easy
mistake to make: there
are a decreasing number
of cases of vaccine-pre-
ventable disease, making
their threat seem small.
But of course, the only
reason for this decrease is
because vaccination rates
have, until recently, been
increasing. What people
aren’t told, but should be,
is the number of people
who would be infected
when different population
percentages are vaccinat-
ed.
Whether or not
vaccines should be man-
datory (with exemptions
to immunocompromised
individuals and those
at risk of anaphylactic
shock) is yet another
debate. The financial cost
of preventing disease is
much less than that of
treating and recovering.
There is also the expla-
nation of herd immunity,
where infections cannot
spread when a threshold
percentage of the popula-
tion is vaccinated, so even
unvaccinated individuals
cannot contract disease.
The crux is, whether a
government can infringe
on individual freedoms,
make health decisions for
everyone, even if for the
public good. Furthermore,
in order to be compulsory,
the government must be
able to track the vaccina-
tion status of everyone,
likely through a database,
which is yet another way
the government would
irritate the anti-authority
libertarians. But, living
in a democratic society
has been, and always will
be, an ultimate paradox of
freedom and sovereignty.
You give up the right to
certain freedoms (follow-
ing the law) in exchange
for the benefits of living
in a society.
a global conspiracy to
deliberately make people
sick so that Big Pharma
can profit from treating
them. They ignore the sci-
entific basis for vaccines
because they’re sure that
Big Pharma tampers with
statistics and cherry-picks
data. I read a comment
online from a mother who
wasn’t going to vaccinate
her son because she
thought her doctor would
ignore her concern of vac-
cine-induced side effects,
and ridicule her for even
considering the possibili-
ty. It’s no surprise people
are unwilling to trust the
health industry; they’ve
had their fair share of
scandals: the opioid crisis,
Big Sugar…
I believe that improved
science communication
and transparency is at
the core of halting the
anti-vax movement.
What links populism
to this movement is a
deep-rooted distrust in
the government, suspicion
of big corporations and
establishments, including
scientists. Scientists
should stop underesti-
mating their audience,
but also shouldn’t scoff
at the doubt in vaccines
and expect anti-vaxxers
to discover the flaws in
their own argument. The
sentiment that science
can only be understood
and discussed by experts
has to be destroyed! It is
this very sentiment that
infuriates anti-vaxxers
when their concerns are
met with jeers instead
of proper, clear explana-
tions. For all the scientific
papers that anti-vaxx-
ers reference that do
somehow show a causa-
tion between vaccines
and other diseases, the
“He got

I always dismissed
the anti-vax movement
as another social media
and populism fuelled
phenomenon, but I never
stopped to wonder why
this is still a topic under
discussion. There is
overwhelming research
backing the safety and
“I always

But before getting into
the more intricate argu-
ments, a couple of quick
cases against vaccinations
and why they are unfound-
ed. One common claim is
that, “Vaccines contain
harmful chemicals such as
aluminum, mercury, and
formaldehyde.” These
are, in truth, present in
vaccines, but not in large
enough amounts to be dan-
gerous; children get more
exposure to aluminum
through breast milk than
from vaccines. Another,
“Autism frequency has in-
creased (in the US, 1 in 59
children are on the autism
spectrum) with the rise of
vaccination rates.” This
can be attributed to better
and more accurate diagno-
sis of autism, not an actual
rise in its occurrence.
These two observations
are linked only through
a progression of modern
medicine; correlation
does not equal to causa-
tion. And lastly, “vaccines
cause severe side effects
like anaphylaxis.” The
risk of anaphylaxis (a
scientific community
should acknowledge the
existence of these articles,
then explain why they are
not credible: too small a
sample size, conflict of
interest, unreliable source,
faulty methodology etc.
Simply repeating to
them that there isn’t any
correlation without ex-
plaining the basis for the
statement, or discussing
their erroneous sources
amongst only themselves,
is not convincing.
There should also be
more information on
government websites
explaining vaccination
on a societal basis instead
of only providing infor-
mation for individuals.
We should also learn to
weed out misinformation
campaigns based on
discord and fear-mon-
gering of the public and
acknowledge that these
groups are separate from
parents who act out of
genuine concern for their
child’s health. Lastly, a
campaign of promotion
instead of suppression
should be pursued. Even
if untrue information
is being suppressed, it
makes anti-vaxxers to
feel even more alienated
and that their opinion has
been overlooked, and only
serves to reinforce their
distrust in the government
and in industry for con-
trolling what they have
the freedom to say.
“Most anti-vax
parents refuse
to vaccinate
their child out
of genuine
concern and
suspicion -
they believe
the risk of
vaccination
is higher
than the risk
of catching
a vaccine-
preventable
disease”
So, who can we blame?
The health industry, for
one. There is a staunch
belief amongst a certain
wing of anti-vaxxers in
“The crux is
whether a
government
can infringe
on individual
freedoms”
