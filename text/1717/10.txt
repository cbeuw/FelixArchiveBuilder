S
eeking New
Horizons II: New
Discoveries is the
second of a three-
part series celebrating the
composers who pushed
the musical boundaries
of the period. The Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra
concert paid homage to the
integral roles Stravinsky,
Korngold, and Dvorak
played in the transitions
from late Romantic to 20th
century music, with the
integration of Romantic
lyrical harmonies with the
dissonance of 20th centu-
ry melodies. And what a
celebration it was!
The concert opened
with some of Stravinsky’s
(1882-1971) lesser known
works, the Suite for Small
Orchestra Nos. 1 and
2. Originally written as
piano duets, the Russian
composer orchestrated
the works between
1917-1925, shortly after
completing his famous
Firebird and Rite of
Spring. They represent
Stravinsky’s early Russian
period transitioning into
his Neoclassical period,
with lighthearted tones
and prominent syncopat-
ed rhythms contrasting
the occasional dissonant
melodies and harmonies.
The colourful rhythms and
expressive wit permeate
the Suites, lending an
infectious charm to the
structured dance forms
as Stravinsky explored
his compositional voice.
The RPO did justice to
Stravinsky’s curious and
explorative voice of the
Suites as the orchestra’s
tenacity brought the
audience onto the dance-
floor in spirit.
Heralding in the
Austrian composer
Korngold (1897-1957)
was British violinist
Jennifer Pike. Korngold
was a child prodigy,
having written his first
ballet at eleven years of
age, and was lauded in
Vienna for his natural
musical talent. He is one
of the most influential
composers for Hollywood
films of the era, and much
of what we recognise
“Startling
clarity of notes
and perfect
intonation of
chords”
“A truly
impressive and
technically-
perfect
performance,
staccato jigs
and all”
as the quintessential
dramatic Hollywood
music is none other than
Korngold’s personal style.
Korngold was Jewish
and vowed to not write
anything besides film
music, which he used to
support his family whilst
Hitler was in power. His
Violin Concerto was the
first that Korngold wrote
following the resolution
of the Second World War
and is one of his most
celebrated pieces. Its three
movements share many of
the themes and melodies
he used for Hollywood
films such as Juarez
and The Prince and the
Pauper, but with the
dramatic flair required for
film music stripped back
to more clean, poignant
melodies of the violin.
Whilst soloist Pike was
technically impeccable,
her interpretation of its
two interlinking themes
in the first movement,
‘Moderato nobile’, was
a touch too stoic for my
liking, and could have
done with greater emo-
tional depth. However,
Pike warmed up in
the second movement,
‘Romanze’. Its slower,
sweet melodies soared
high and pulled at the au-
dience’s heartstrings, with
Pike’s startling clarity of
notes and perfect intona-
tion of chords lending a
precision and yearning to
the movement. The final
movement, ‘Allegro assai
vivace’, is the most tech-
nically challenging and
theatrical, as evidenced
by Pike’s E-string dramat-
ically snapping halfway
through. She was quick
on her feet and borrowed
the concertmaster’s violin
to continue playing, never
missing a note – leaving
the concertmaster to
swap violins with the
assistant concertmaster
so that he could play a
brief short solo during the
movement (in addition
to leading the orchestra,
of course!) Despite all of
this, Pike completed the
movement beautifully,
having fully warmed up
from the slightly wooden
first movement to deliver
a truly impressive and
technically-perfect perfor-
mance, staccato jigs and
all. She finished her per-
formance with an encore
piece – Bacewicz’s Polish
Caprice – that showcased
her skills with quick,
challenging chords and
slow, deep melodies. This
British soloist is definitely
one to keep an eye out for.
The concert finished
with Dvorak’s (1841-
1904) famous Symphony
No. 9, From the New
World, written when he
was the director of the
National Conservatory of
Music in New York City.
Dvorak’s syncopated
rhythms with modal
melodies pay homage
to traditional folk tunes
of both America and
Europe, with whispers of
famous Native American
melodies such as ‘Swing
Low, Sweet Chariot’ and
‘Massa Dear’ reflecting
his fascination with native
African-American music.
The New World symphony
opens with a motif heavily
influenced by Beethoven’s
Ninth Symphony, before
the poignant American
melodies of the second
movement, ‘Largo’, are
rendered beautifully by
the woodwind section.
The dance-like third
movement, ‘Scherzo’, is
influenced by Longfel-
low’s poem ‘The Song of
Hiawatha’, with Dvorak’s
signature rhythmic
drive. Finally, Dvorak’s
conservative Brahmsian
style transforms to a more
experimentalist Wagner
style by the finale. Re-
peating motifs adopted
into different forms and
played by different instru-
ments showcased both the
simplicity and versatility
of an extended theme.
The RPO pulled off a
stunning performance of
Dvorak’s symphony. They
truly breathed together,
with nary a single note out
of place. Each orchestral
section moved and func-
tioned as one, with all the
sections working together
in perfect synchrony
to completely take the
audience into a new world,
one filled with fascinating
colours and delightful
melodies that took your
breath away. The standing
ovation they received was
well-deserved, and was
a perfect end to a most
enjoyable evening.
