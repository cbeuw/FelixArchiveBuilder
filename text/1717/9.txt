The Ghost Map: dive into the 1854 London cholera
outbreak
T
he setting of this
book - a chol-
era outbreak
in Victorian
England revolving
around cesspools con-
taminations - is not
particularly the most
attractive thing in the
world, yet it’s fasci-
nating to see the story
behind how we came to
understand that cholera
is water-borne, how it
established the base
of epidemiology, how
the public health and
city planning system
evolved, and how it
made urban-living pos-
sible. There are many
aspects to this cross-dis-
ciplinary case study that
it’s difficult to string
all my thoughts on it
together.
The premise
It’s 1854. Enter the
thriving, rising city of
London with 2.5 million
people in the cramped,
underdeveloped Eliza-
bethan infrastructure.
With the population
skyrocketing but
without proper sewage
system, residents at the
time simply discard-
ed of their wastes in
cesspool, and following
The Nuisances Removal
and Diseases Prevention
Act of 1846, into the
river. Miasma theorists
concluded that cholera
was air-borne, caused
by “miasma” particles
spreading in air. There-
fore legislations based
upon that idea, originally
meant to stop the spread
of infectious diseases,
ironically encouraged
the disease we now
know is water-borne.
By late August and
early September, the
infamous Broad Street
outbreak occurred, with
over 10% of the popula-
tion dying in the span of
seven days - giving way
to physician John Snow
a chance to prove his
germ theory with raw
data.
The double-blind ex-
periment and the data
collection
Now looking back,
it’s absolutely impres-
sive that Snow seized
the opportunity to
utilize the event as an
intersection between a
natural experiment and
an observational study
to examine possible
causes, since controlled
experimentation was
certainly not a viable
option given technical
limitations and ethical
concerns. As with all
observational studies,
obtaining accurate,
reliable information
required tremendous
effort. Fortunately,
Snow recruited the help
of Henry Whitehead, a
local curate with access
to information otherwise
unavailable to Snow.
Whitehead had the
advantage of first hand
experiences with the
community members.
As a result, he was able
to acquire a diverse set
of data, which enabled
him to observe correla-
tions between unusual
factors. From there
Snow drew the ghost
map that shows clearly
how concentrated the
cholera cases were
around a single source
that is the contaminated
water pump. It’s worth
pointing out that this
fits into the framework
of a double-blind ex-
periment, as neither
the patients nor the
investigators knew the
true cause of cholera
was, thus eliminating
potential biases. In a
traditional experiment,
water supplies might
be overlooked as a
predictor, but in obser-
vational studies, all the
confounding factors
eventually steering clear
and the true independent
variable eventually
coming to the surface.
This mode of collabora-
tion sets the foundation
for modern day epide-
miology, combining
demographic study and
scientific data.
How faulty ideas per-
sist despite evidence
An idea that had per-
sonally intrigued me and
appeared many times
throughout Snow’s in-
vestigation was how the
Miasma theory persisted
despite the concrete
evidence against
it. Even before the
outbreak in 1854, Snow
grew skeptical of the
theory, doubtful of how
the same doctor who
attended the infected
patients during the
infectious phase stayed
free of cholera. Yet its
proponents remained
fiercely for the mias-
matic theory to a point
where their confirmation

bias “blinded them to the
patterns that Snow and
Whitehead perceived so
clearly”. In an attempt
to test Snow’s findings,
Hall’s team, the Board
of Health Committee,
failed to examine the
factors resembling water
consumption patterns
and instead focused on
those relating to miasma
and sanitary conditions,
which happened to be
confounding factors.
This is not the first
story of one theory
overthrowing another,
but nevertheless the
difficulties involved
shows how stubborn the
scientific community
could be and the possi-
bility of the right ideas
out there waiting to be
proven right.
A glimpse into alcohol
in preventing cholera
Another aspect that
stood out to me was the
role alcohol played in the
quest for the true cause
of cholera. Historically,
the solution to combat
the lack of unpolluted
water was through
consumption of alcohol,
as its antibacterial
properties helped fight
off waterborne diseases
like dysentery. Before
the arrival of coffee and
tea, beer and wine do-
mesticated “one micro-
bial life-form in order to
counter the threat posed
by other microbes.” In
many instances in the
investigation of cholera,
alcohol found its way
back to the stage and
later leading Snow to
conclude that cholera
was caused by the
bacteria Vibrio cholerae.
The effects
Consider the effects
of such an outbreak
- not only the deaths,
but also the chaos and
the helplessness - and
the idea that perhaps
high-density living
is not feasible, that a
city may just collapse.
Therefore identifying
the contamination as the
cause of the outbreak
and proving that cholera
is waterborne gave
many a glimmer of hope
and takes away that fear
of urban-living.
Some final thoughts
His writing paints a
vivid picture of Dick-
ensian London, summa-
rizes well a multidis-
ciplinary case without
overemphasizing on any
aspect and adds colour to
a subject that could be a
little dry otherwise. This
story, as author Steven
Johnson puts it, of “a
deadly bacterium, a vast
city, and two gifted but
very different men” is
certainly a worthwhile
read for those interested
in learning a thing or
two about history, statis-
tics or public health.
