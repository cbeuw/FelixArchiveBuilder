I
’m unsure how many
of you are aware of
this but apparently
voting in the student
elections opens at 12 am
today. A keen follower of
student politics myself, I
am excited to find out just
who my representatives
to the Union are going to
be. Despite several years
watching every single
team of sabbs accomplish
almost nothing of note
during their tenure, it is
always exciting to find
out just how this next crop
will fuck up.
I’m especially excited
to find out just how they
will waste all of the
£30000 being funnelled
into their pockets. Given
that they are mostly brain
dead by the time they have
finished the role, I imagine
a significant proportion of
it is spent on life support-
although they clearly did
not invest enough to alow
the sabbs to breathe and
approve payments at the
same time. That’s what
happens when you have
the IQ of a small legume.
However, I’m getting
ahead of myself. At this
point in time, we have
not yet made the choice
of which mindless clone
we’re going to have in
the Union, or exactly how
far college will have an
arm up their arse telling
them exactly which way
to yelp. No, we are still in
the sweet spot beforehand,
where anything may yet
be possible. Campaigning
began on Wednesday and
already I’ve seen at least
8 or 9 shit posters with a
pun on their name based
on the role they were
applying for. In all honesty
the KGB probably had a
better sense of humour.
I’m unsure if you
were unlucky enough
to catch the Meet the
Candidates debate, but let
me assure you, I was an
avid viewer. ISIS haven’t
been releasing quite as
many execution videos
as they used to and I was
excited for a recreation
of Meet the Candidates
2018. However, I was dis-
appointed when the event
proved to be remarkably
well put together and ran
semi-smoothly, despite
audio issues and a host
that looked like Princess
Diana immediately before
she went through the car
dashboard. It was also
weird that they let Edward
Snowden commentate on
the sofa. I thought he was
still holed up in Moscow
being choke-fucked by
Vadimir Putin. This year’s
candidates at least seem
promising; they made a
lot of promises.
However,itmaybethat,
by roasting our student
representatives, I am
missing the point. Every
year, candidates promise
meaningful reform and
change, and yet every
year they completely
fail to deliver. At present
we are witnessing a very
real reduction in services
offered to students, with
cuts to the food available
on campus and failures by
college essentially going
unpunished. Is it truly fair
to blame the candidates,
who I genuinely believe,
cross the Union threshold
on their first day with the
best of intentions? It’s not
their fault that the world of
graduate employment just
wouldn’t suit them at the
present time. The problem
ultimately lies with the
Union bureaucracy being
run not for the benefit of
the students at Imperial,
but to meet budgetary
targets set far in the past.
The fact that the sabbs are
there for me to fling shit at
only shields those that act
behind the scenes to fuck
everything up. But I’m
not here to offer solutions.
I’m just here to hate.
