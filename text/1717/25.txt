You’ve had Indian food,
sure, but we guarantee
you haven’t had anything
that tastes close to what
Mumbai Mix has to offer.
If you spend a lot of time
on campus, chances are
you’ve probably heard of
Mumbai Mix – the only
authentic Indian food stall
at the Farmers Market on
Tuesdays. If you haven’t,
you must’ve at least seen
it with the long queues
of hungry students there
every week, or got a whiff
of their homemade custom
masala (mix of spices), or
probably had a chat with
the lovely team operating
the family-run business.
Mumbai Mix serves a
minimalist menu, making
choosing what to have
for lunch so much less
stressful for the indecisive
ones among us (seriously,
what’s up with those
20-page menus every-
where?). With their most
popular option being the
Dosa Wrap with Biryani
Rice, you could also opt
for something lighter like
the Dosa Wrap by itself,
or a crunchy, deliciously
golden vegetable samosa,
and some delicious
homemade masala chai
on the side – a delectable
“It really felt
like I had
just been
handed a slice
of Mumbai,
with the
authenticity
of the flavours
oozing from
the masalas
second-to-
none” “freshly-
made
chutneys -
including a
fiery roasted
red pepper,
a delicate
tamarind and
date, and my
favourite,
a soothing
coconut-
coriander”
substitute to your after-
noon skinny latte. Alter-
natively, you could also
go for a vegetable biryani
and potato curry if you’ve
got a bigger appetite.
I’ve heard everyone
raving about their food
constantly, and after
reading the fantastic piece
on the authenticity of the
food and how it started
off in Felix last week, I
knew I had to give it a try
myself and see what the
hype was all about and
boy, the whole experience
was amazing!
Queuing for their food
was an experience within
itself – the fragrant aromas
wafting from the food got
me excited and made for
a mouth-watering wait.
At the front, the service
was immaculate – the
team (Mohini, Deshna,
and Dimple) greets you
with smiles and are pleas-
antly cheerful and chatty,
offering that perfect break
from revision after a long
morning at the library.
The Dosa Wrap
was in its own league,
with a combination of
flavours and aromas I’d
only ever tasted in local
markets whilst travelling
abroad. It really felt like
I had just been handed
a slice of Mumbai, with
the authenticity of the
flavours oozing from the
masalas second-to-none.
The pancake, made solely
using lentils and rice,
was delicately thin yet
incredibly satisfying, and
the ladies at Mumbai Mix
even spice each individual
wrap to your liking - even
serving extra hot pancakes
that would satisfy that
heat craving for all those
“Nando’s Extra Hot isn’t
even that spicy” people.
A potato and onion
filling complemented the
pancakes beautifully – the
potatoes were slow-roast-
ed to perfection, and
spiced enough so that
they were indulgent but
not overpowered. The
dish was then topped with
freshly-made chutneys –
including a fiery roasted
red pepper, a delicate
tamarind and date, and
my personal favourite, a
soothing coconut-corian-
der.
To complement the
wrap, I opted for a
vegetable samosa - how
could I not with the
beautiful crispy golden
coating (literally felt like
it was calling my name!).
The contrast between the
crunchiness of the pastry
combined with the hot and
hearty filling made for the
perfect side dish for my
wrap, and left my home-
cooked food craving
100% satisfied (and was
such a yummy change to
your usual library café
food or a cold BLT).
Whether you’re
watching your wallet
or your waist, Mumbai
Mix is the perfect venue
for both. At only £6 for
a Dosa Wrap and £1.50
for a Samosa, this stall is
definitely a hit if you’re
bargain hunting at the
Farmers Market, or if
you’re on a student budget
(RIP student finance). If
you’re trying to stay lean,
you’ll definitely want
to swap your salad for a

yummy wrap, which is
surprisingly quite low in
calories (who would’ve
guessed you could have
that much potato with so
little damage done, eh?),
and rich in nutrients with
all the locally sourced
ingredients used. Being
gluten-free, you also
don’t get that belly bloat
with Mumbai Mix that
you do with other food,
and you’re satisfyingly
full without feeling like
you’ve just consumed a
truck of food. With a full
vegetarian menu, you’ll
also be doing your bit
for the environment (a
great way to add No-Meat
Tuesdays to your week
without even missing the
meat!)
With all that said, what
are you waiting for? Head
down to the food market
next Tuesday and get
a taste of this amazing
goodness for yourself
– we’re sure you won’t
regret it!
