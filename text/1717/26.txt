Don’t call your country “developed”
I
s the UK developed
or developing?
What about Vietnam
- developed or
developing?
The World Bank no
longer uses the terms
“developed” or “develop-
ing” and I couldn’t agree
more. The distinction of
“developed” and “devel-
oping” countries date to
the period just after the
Second World War, when
institutions such as the
United Nations (UN) and
WorldBankwerefounded,
which defined the terms.
One of the key objectives
of these institutions was
to drive development
and reduce poverty with
the hope that this will
avert future catastrophic
conflict. This was the time
of the baby boom and
when US, where these or-
ganizations are based, did
not question its position as
the world superpower. It
was the time before Silent
Spring and the realization
that natural resources are
bounded. This drive for
globalization has had a
huge impact on the world
since and undoubtedly has
had an immense success
in improving the quality
of human life in the past
half century.
According to Gap-
Minder, life expectancy
at birth in Vietnam was
consistently 30 years old
between 1875 and 1939.
Today it is 75, higher
than that of any country
before the Second World
War and barely differs
from that of the longest
living countries today.
The UK, for all its invest-
ment in healthcare, has
a life-expectancy of just
six years longer than that
of Vietnam today. This is
not to say that healthcare
is not far better in the UK
than Vietnam, but it high-
lights that development
has been such a success
that the gap between
wealthy and poor nations
in terms of fundamental
human needs as a whole is
diminishing.
One of the reasons
behind the movement to
globalization by organiza-
tions such as the UN was
that trade makes countries
inter-dependent and acts
as a counterbalance to
war, a concern which was
very much on the minds
of leaders at the time. In
theory, if one country goes
to war with another, they
hurt themselves in losing
trade with their opponent
and any of their allies
which decide to enforce
trade barriers.
This is just a sketch of
a complex and nuanced
political and economic
theory, and not one which
is the topic of this dis-
cussion - the question is
not whether global trade
between “developing”
and “developed” countries
does or does not ensure
global peace.
The question is thus
whether dividing the
world into “developing”
and “developed” coun-
tries is meaningful and
secondly whether the de-
velopment is sustainable.
What is the difference
between“developed”
and“developing”?
The UN argues that
“the designations ‘devel-
oped’ and ‘developing’
are intended for statistical
convenience and do not
necessarily express a
judgement about the stage
reached by a particular
country or area in the
development process”.
However it admits that
“there is no established
convention for the desig-
nation of ‘developed’ and
‘developing’ countries
or areas in the United
Nations system”.
Why is it that the terms
“poor” and “wealthy” do
not suffice? Why do we
talk of “developed” versus
“developing” - which only
replaced the similarly
loaded terms “first world”
and “third world”? It is
because those in the “first
world” elected the terms.
In case you are wonder-
ing, the “second world”
disappeared with the fall
of the USSR and the com-
munist states which it was
used to denote. The term
“developing” implies
that such countries will
eventually become like
the “developed” ones
with sufficient fortune
and good leadership.
However, are societies of
“developed” consumerist
societies really so first-
rate as the language we
use implies?
Inevitably through
historical or geographical
circumstances some
countries have fewer
resources, less power or
less developed industry
than others, and it is along
this distinction that the
divide of “developed” and
“developing” are drawn.

The IMF, another organi-
zation heavily involved in
development, defines de-
veloping countries on the
criteria of “(1) per capita
income level, (2) export
diversification ... and
(3) degree of integration
into the global financial
system”. In other words,
the grade of development
isbasedonmaterialwealth
and power of individuals
(in the first criteria) and of
the amount of global trade
a country engages in (the
second and third criteria).
Is development
sustainable?
We all sense that more
material wealth, once
above a certain threshold,
is weakly correlated with
happiness. What it does
give is power to decide
what is produced within
society. For instance
individuals can use
their economic power to
choose electricity from a
renewable energy supplier
and thus increase the
proportion of electricity
generation from renewa-
ble sources.
But economic power
also gives the ability to
do things which are not
sustainable. Even I have
been tempted to invest
in the next generation
phone or a flight abroad
even though it is not a
fundamental human need
and I am well aware of the
carbon footprint.
Even if we try to
avoid the temptation, the
ability to do something
has the subversive effect
of reducing choice. For
instance, because smart-
phones are so cheap and
readily available it is
expected that everyone
has one. Even if we
set aside the isolation
from social contact by
this simple luddism
even the most basic of
services such as banking,
healthcare or accessing
government will not work
without. This unarguably
makes government more
efficient and allows easier
access, but also relies on
devices made from re-
sources with finite supply
and huge social and
environmental impacts
in their production which
presently are treated as
pretty disposable.
Though levels of
consumption of natural
resources by “developed”
nations per person aren’t
rising, they don’t look
set to fall to sustainable
levels. They are far higher
than that of the “develop-
ing” nations where most
of manufacturing and
primary production has
been relocated. Alongside
providing for the wealthy
countries, developing
countries are showing a
rapid rise in consumption.
If the entire world’s
population were to live
as an average person in
a “developed” country
we would need vastly
more resources than
can be foreseeably
produced. If development
means becoming like
“developed” countries,
development is a rather
short-sighted pursuit.
Rather than defining
development on wealth,
which there is a finite
supply of, there must
be something deeper to
define the distinction on.
What should this some-
thing be?
I don’t have the answer,
but my belief is that one
criterion is meaning.
When something is ex-
pensive we find meaning
in buying it - it is precious
because we had to sacri-
fice having that thing over
having something else.
Equally we find meaning
in work, in friendship, in
understanding a scientific
theory, in solving a cross
word puzzle, reading an
article in the newspaper.
I don’t think it would be
easy to quantify such a
thing as meaning as we
do with money and life
expectancy. Indeed I
don’t know if it is quan-
tifiable, but if it is then
it is possibly the most
limitless resource. The
current metric by which
economies are measured
are rather more correlated
with material wealth, a
finite resource, than is
sensible.
We all want people
to live meaningful lives,
and we are aware that
not everyone has the
opportunities that people
in “developed” countries.
However, what if having
the wealth which those in
“developed” nations have
is not healthy? What if we
actually need to sacrifice
something from our own
lives so that we can live
more equally with others
on our planet?
I don’t have the
answers. I have only more
questions. I hope you’d
agree that we should
question whether, from an
environmental perspec-
tive, “developed” nations
are really so developed.

Implicitly labelling wealthy countries as the role model for development countries is a bad idea for humanity
“Rather than

be something
deeper to
