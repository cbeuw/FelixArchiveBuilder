Deputy President (Finance & Services)
Fifi Henry
H
i! My name is Fifi, I'm a third year Materials
Engineer and I'm running for DPFS. This
role requires experience, dedication and trust
between the sabbatical officers and you, the
students. With 3 years of bar experience, including a
year as a manager at Beit Bars, I have valuable knowl-
edge in union finances, events and services at Union
outlets, and an unwavering dedication to the student
experience. I know what works, what the students want,
and how to deliver it. And so! My promise to you:
• Bars: Lobby against changes to food and drink
policies, including evening food service at h-bar and improving staff benefits.
Improve sustainability by reducing food and plastic waste. Introduce new club
nights with a range of drinks deals.
• Sustainability: Run a 'Go Green' campaign, including lobbying the college to
increase dependency on renewable sources, reduce unethical investments, and
reduce plastic waste across college.
• Clubs and Societies: better training for club finances to access a variety of
payment options, and supply transport for training, fixtures and national com-
petitions, and accommodation for national competitions.
• Food and Drink: Loyalty schemes for purchases at all bars/catering outlets.
Introduce a better variety of options across all food outlets, with regards to
healthy food as well as various dietary requirements.
• Opportunities and Training: Improve first aid and mental first aid training
across college. More student consultation and involvement in decisions that
affect YOU. Create a representative student board that enables better transpar-
ency and involvement in said decisions.
Vote Fifi for DPFS!

H
aving been Chair of Sailing, Yachting and
Sports Sector Treasurer, I've been immersed
in the Union financial system and budgeted
for over 50 clubs. However, I've encountered
issues that I feel strongly about and want to change.
AIMS:
SERVICES
• Transparency: Increase communication with the
student body to improve awareness of changes to
campus services.
• Bars & Outlets: Develop a plan working WITH
College to retain and improve student oriented services: keep Reynolds open,
reinstate dinner service at h-bar and improve white city outlets, providing key
improvements for graduate and ICSM community spaces.
• Night-time Food: Lobby college for increased availability of late night, hot
provisions.
• Consultation: Find your food/drink preferences and deliver those options
while working to keep prices student friendly.
• Queuing: Implement a more efficient queuing system into the Union and
Metric.
• Welfare: Look into the introduction of short interval sleep facilities on campus.
SUSTAINABILITY
• Reducing Waste: Work with Greening Imperial to introduce incentives such as
discounts for bringing your own containers to take food away and repurpose
leftover food from campus services.
• Recycling: Set up a crisp packaging collection point at Imperial and find an
alternative to mixed material packaging to reduce plastic waste.
• CSPsStreamline:Aid the implementation of the Sports Hub, with infographics
to understand the monetary breakdown and improve eActivities functionality.
• Training: Set up interactive flow charts to expedite your queries on finances
(especially VAT!) and ensuring availability of drop-in sessions at convenient
times.

aving worked at 568 for almost two years
and been social sec for a society, I am in a
unique position to know how to maximise
the profitability of the bar and make sure
more funds are available for student services. I've also
sat on a society committee for three years so really
understand the challenges involved with society budget
allocation and how the union handles sponsorship.
These experiences, plus so many more throughout my
four years here, have made it clear to me exactly what
needs to be done to make life better for the students of
Imperial.If I am elected as your DPFS I promise to:
• Change the claims and budget approval process-
es to make it quicker and easier
• Resist the proposed funding cuts to library cafe food and the proposed reduc-
tion in opening hours of Reynolds.
• Improve the treatment of bar staff, including making sure they are paid the
London living wage.
• Push the college to prioritise environmental policy, including withdrawing
investments in fossil fuel companies
• Review and streamline costly services like Imperial Plus
In the past few years the revenue from Beit bar, h-bar and Reynolds has dropped
substantially. I will cover the cost of the improvements mentioned above (and more!)
by changing the ACC ticketing system so more tickets can be sold on the door, pro-
viding more drinks promotions, making it easier and cheaper for student societies
to book out the bar and investing in outdoor heaters to increase seating space in the
winter.

H
ey, I'm Steph! I'm a 4th
year mathematician,
who isn't done with Imperial yet. I have
really enjoyed my time here and now I want
to dedicate myself to a greener, happier and
more efficient Imperial for us and future students. I
have been an active member of the Dance Club, where
in my years on and off of committee, I have really en-
joyed being responsible for the club, its members, and
contributing to its success. As DPFS, I would like to
give back to the university that has been my home for
the last 4 years. Here's what I plan to do while serving
as your Deputy President of Finance and Services:
**COMMUNICATION**
• Build a centralised platform to share events and polls and get more students
involved in campus decision making
• Be more transparent with Union spending and make sure it reflects our values
• Continue building relations with the College so student concerns are taken
seriously
**CSPs**
• Update the eActivities website and Union search engine
• Introduce drop-in sessions, video tutorials and better training for committee
members and devote time to streamlining approval processes
**STUDENT LIFE**
• Improve quality and accessibility of food services at Imperial
• Introduce options for quick meals at the Union, to reduce waiting times for
food
• Expand the healthy and vegetarian food selection
**GREENING IMPERIAL**
• Improve infrastructure for cyclists
• More robust and reuseable cutlery

Deputy President (Welfare)
Jamie
Coombs
H
i, Jamie here! I'm a final-year Physics stu-
dent and I firmly believe my policies would
improve your experience at Imperial. Vote
for me to help make Imperial a better place
for students like you.Why? Because I took two inter-
ruptions of studies in 2016 for mental health reasons.
Despite the College spending £680,659 on mental
health, the Times Higher Education 2018 Student expe-
rience survey placed Imperial 64th
. I think the system is
broken. With your vote, I'd like to make it better.
• Hire an ICU Counsellor. By hiring a full-time
union counsellor we can offer same day appoint-
ments with a trained personal support officer.
• Organise Full-Body MOT days - By holding Full-Body MOT days we can
ensure students can address physical health issues before they become full
breakdowns.
• Finish the Online Petition System - By finishing the system we started years
ago we can build a more democratic union.
• Deliver the College Student Support Consultation. By holding College ac-
countable for past promises we can see big changes to your Welfare.
• Create Union Training and Online Quizzes for Personal Tutors. By providing
Union accreditation tutors will be better equipped to handle welfare issues.
• Consider more university-run postgraduate accommodation. We need an
affordable solution for the long term, not a GradPad stopgap.
• Align with NUS campaign to reform Gender Recognition Act 2004.
• Puppy Therapy Sessions* - Vote for me to reduce exam stress with hecking
good doggos.
So please, vote for me on Monday 11th
- Thursday 14th
March. Cheers, Jamie

i, I'm Shervin! I've been the RCSU Welfare
Officer for two years, working hard to im-
prove the lives of 3,000+ students. As well
as giving out masses of condoms at Freshers
Fairs, I led the student involvement in the faculty per-
sonal tutoring review - resulting in compulsory training
for tutors - and organised a successful Welfare Week.
I also spent a year as a London Nightline Volunteer,
dedicating evenings to supporting students and gaining
a unique insight into student wellbeing issues. Now I'm
running to be your next DPW to realise change across
Imperial.I will consistently champion the needs of the
students to College by:

fter I talked about my working purpose and
feasible plan to our now union president Rob
and some international students, I get my
final manifesto:
1. Although there will be BREXIT at the end of
this month, Imperial and the student union will
be same "European and Global", continue to
focus on provide a good environment for EU and
international students.
2. I will lead the union to suggest Uni to invite
more sponsors to provide different degrees of
small scholarships, in return, the union can help them hold different forms of
job fairs.
3. Organizing more events can be held on campus for different groups to create
a more conducive environment for people of different beliefs and sexual
orientations to live and study, that, such as e-sports competitions, so that more
students can enrich their spare time and find their own interests
4. To submit a formal letter to suggest Uni and government to extend the duration
of the student visa, so that more international students can feel the inclusive-
ness of the school and the UK, and get more job opportunities
5. To suggest Uni for more flexible options for failing grades. For example, if
you only failed in one exam, you may could get a merit or distinction if you
have an average final grade more than 60 or 70, but if you failed more than
one, that means you only can get a pass.

• Lobbying to remove the £95 Disabilities Advisory Service diagnosis cost
• Fighting for subsidies to private therapy while counselling service waiting
times reduce
• Consulting you on and reviewing the provision of menstrual products around
College
• Expanding LGBT+ Ally Networks to all departments
To ensure the Union maximises its support for students, I will:
• Reform wellbeing rep and liberation officer training to better equip volunteers
• Work with the Felix editor to re-establish the Felix Welfare section, to give
students an outlet and raise awareness about welfare topics
• Investigate new pastoral systems for postgraduates, and ensure postgraduate
representation at all levels
Having worked closely with previous DPWs, I've seen how the introduction of
the Wellbeing Representation Network has transformed the role - the next DPW
needs to better work with this network to enact change. I'm the candidate with the
experience necessary to do this, so #VoteShervIn as your DPW!
