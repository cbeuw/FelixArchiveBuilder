Administered Kashmir.
Whilst the bomber was
born and raised in India (a
fact ignored by the Indian
media), he was funded
and equipped by the
Pakistan based terrorist
organisation JeM, who
have publicly taken credit
for the attack. Over the
last two weeks in tit-for-
tat the militaries of both
countries have conducted
cross border operations,
thus escalating the ten-
sions between the nuclear
armed states.
Russia, North Korea, nor
Iran. The India-Pakistan
conflict over the disputed
region of Jammu and
Kashmir has been at the
epicentre of at least three
nuclear flashpoints in this
millennium. This colonial
era conflict has already
resulted in over four wars,
with the latest one being
in 1999 when both coun-
tries had declared nuclear
arsenals.
who before had never
been to India, had omitted
the three princely states
whose rulers had refused
to merge with either
India or Pakistan. Whilst
Hyderabad and Junagadh
was successfully annexed
into the Indian union,
the question of Jammu
and Kashmir remained.
Kashmir had a Hindu
Maharaja ruling over a
kingdom which had a 70%
Muslim population, and
controlling vital rivers for
both India and Pakistan.
Voltaire famously said
of Prussia that unlike
most states which have an
army, in Prussia the army
had a state. This descrip-
tion perfectly describes
Pakistan, with most of the
period since independ-
ence having been ruled
by the military. In order to
sustain its disproportional
budget allocation, for
pure survival the military
establishment must
maintain the constant
fear of a perennial enemy.
Since the Soviet invasion
ofAfghanistan, it has been
the policy of Pakistan’s
military establishment
to use Islamic militants
“to bleed India through
a thousand cuts”. When
Pakistan-funded mili-
tants bombed the Indian
parliament in 2002 and
laid siege to Mumbai and
killed 174 people in 2008,
tensions between both
countries were at boiling
points. Yet previous
Indian governments had
the good wisdom of prac-
tising restraint. But this is
an election year in India.
The Modi-led Indian
government launched
“pre-emptive” airstrikes
within Pakistani territory,
the first ever military
response outside the
disputed Kashmir region
since 1971. In order to
save face, Imran Khan,
Pakistan’s cricketer turned
Prime Minister, ordered
retaliatory air strikes last
week. Whist the details
remain murky through
the fog of war, an Indian
MiG 21 was shot down in
Pakistani airspace whilst
shooting down a Pakistani
F-16. Thankfully all the
airmen safely ejected.
as per the Geneva Proto-
cols. So the world can rest
easy once again, till the
next time these two quar-
relsome neighbours think
to raise the collective
blood pressures of people
around the world.
In order to avoid a
repeat performance, there
must be concrete measures
undertaken by both coun-
tries. Firstly, Kashmiris
must recognise that an
independent Jammu and
Kashmir will never ma-
terialise because the geo-
political reality will never
tolerate an independent
state sandwiched between
three nuclear powers (the
third one being China).
Therefore, the many
rightful grievances of
young Kashmiris must
be settled within the Pa-
kistani and Indian states.
Secondly, the Pakistani
state must abandon its
foolhardy use of proxies
to change the borders of
the Line of Control. For
too long, international
terrorists like Hafiz Saeed
and Massod Azhar have
walked the streets of
Pakistan with impunity.
For who can forget that
Osama Bin Laden was
living a few kilometres off
their GCHQ. If Pakistan
doesn’t want to be a pariah
state, it must accept the
diplomatic norm of this
century, Pakistan must
stop funding terrorist
organisations and help
to bring them to justice.
Not only India, but Iran
and Afghanistan have
suffered in the hands of
Pakistani terrorist. But
above all, the good people
of Pakistan have lost over
70,000 fellow citizens to
the scourge of terrorism
since 2001. And lastly,
Indian politicians must

When the last three
American presidents were
asked which region gave
them the most sleepless
nights, the answer wasn’t
But before we move
forward, perhaps a brief
historical refresher is
required. In 1947, as 200
years of British colonial-
ism in India was winding
down, the borders of
the region had to be
redrawn for the creation
of Pakistan. Partition
was a messy affair with
over 1.5 million deaths in
Punjab and Bengal over
the contentious border,
let alone the question of
the princely states. The
border which was drawn

What started off as
a measure to appease
Modi’s right wing flank
ahead of the upcoming
general election, a series
of miscalculations have
had the subcontinent, if
not the world on the verge
of nuclear annihilation. In
fact, the capture of Indian
Airforce Wing-Com-
mander Abhinandan,
which was recorded by
smartphones of Pakistani
villagers, forced both
sides to deescalate. As a
peace measure, Pakistan
released Wing-Com-
mander Abhinandan back
to Indian hands last Friday
not heed the sabre-rattling
of the Indian far right and
recognise there can be
no winners by provoking
Pakistan with military
attacks,especiallybecause
Pakistan has not declared
a no-first use policy with
respect to its growing
nuclear arsenal. Above
all, India must recognise
the legitimate grievances
of the Kashmir people. To
start with, India can repeal
the Armed Forces Special
Powers Act, which has
effectively militarised
the state for too long, and
begin meaningful talks
with Pakistan and separa-
tists to peacefully resolve
the conflict.
A hundred years
ago, the first world war
consumed the lives of
21 million people and
changed the course of
history. The book Guns
of August examined that
at the heart of WWI was
the miscalculations by
each side. With nuclear
weapons in the equation
there can be no such
miscalculations. The fate
of humanity is within the
hands of Pakistan and
India. Let us hope that
cooler head will always
prevail.
