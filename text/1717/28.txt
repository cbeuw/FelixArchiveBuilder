I
t is a well-known
truth that life at
university can be ex-
tremely stressful and
can consequently have a
negative impact on our
mental health. It has been
shown that most mental
health problems develop
by the age of 24 , and in
2015-16 alone, 15,000
first-year students at UK
universities reported
having a mental health
problem .
Apart from the obvious
academic pressures of
studying, students are
simultaneously battling
the atrocious financial
struggles of paying for
rent, commuting and
weekly groceries to get
by (I dare not mention our
huge student loan debt!).
For those eager enough to
join Clubs & Societies, at-
tending regular meetings,
events and training can
become an overwhelming
responsibility. And to top
things off, many of us also
struggle with the emotion-
al challenges of dealing
with relationship and
family problems. Whilst
these are all pertinent
issues to us as students,
there are still many people
who are oblivious to the
complex challenges that
we face.
Thursday 7th
March
2019 marked ‘University
Mental Health Day’: a
national day to recognise
student mental health
and raise awareness. This
year’s theme was the
power of ‘using your
voice’ as a means of
addressing the existing
gaps in knowledge,
mental health literacy and
the support available to
students . Essentially the
idea is for students and
supporters to use their
voices to shape the future.
As Mental Health
Officer, one of the main
tasks I have been working
on behind the scenes this
year has been to create a
‘Health and Wellbeing
Survey’ for all students at
Imperial. The purpose of
the survey is to create a
channel of communication
for students to use their
voices and tell me what
changes they would like
to see in the College. It
also allows me to pinpoint
which areas of university
life need to be enriched,
whilst also identifying un-
der-represented groups in
the College. By using the
feedback from the survey,
I aim to devise effective
strategies to improve
overall student mental
health and wellbeing. It
therefore seemed fitting
to launch the survey on
University Mental Health
Day 2019 and give
YOU the opportunity to
use your voice to enact
change. The link to the
survey can be found on all
Imperial College Union
social media channels and
will be sent through via
newsletter to all student
emails. So what are you
waiting for? Let’s use our
voices to start changing
the student mental health
narrative, one by one.
If you have any mental
health related concerns or
issues you would like to
discuss, please feel free to
