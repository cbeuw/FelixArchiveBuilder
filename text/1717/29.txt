graphed exclusively for
the show, mixing styles
from different societies.
This year we will keep
you on the edge of your
seat with a bachata and
hip hop couple dance, a
sassy jazz and tap choreo,
a tap and ballroom fusion,
and a jazz and hip hop
piece. To end the show,
Dance Company and Fun-
kology will be featuring
in the finale. Imperial is
not all about science and
engineering, and collab-
orations give dancers the
chance to get creative
and experiment with new
styles.
DI Show has been a
highlight of the student
experience for many
dancers, and everyone on
stage has the best time
performing. Our passion
for dancing is really
conveyed to the audience,
and we hope you will
want to enjoy the Dance
Imperial community
by the end of the show
(membership is free!).

Show is bound to be one

class for weeks. You will

a range of dance styles,
from belly dancing to hip
hop, from jazz to pole
dancing, as well as salsa,
