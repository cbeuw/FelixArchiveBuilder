I
t was a glorious
Wednesday afternoon
in the middle of
February - the hottest
winter day on record -
which was no surprise to
many of Imperial’s cross
country runners who
knew this competition had
been hotting up for some
time.
The final fixture in the
London Universities and
Colleges Cross Country
League was to take place
just a (7km) stone’s throw
from Beit Quad – in the
fields behind the infamous
HMP Wormwood Scrubs.
Prior to the race,
Imperial were leading the
women’s league, with the
B team also clinging to
the podium in third.
The men’s team were
looking fairly comfortable
in third place in the men’s
league, but there was still
everything to play for
going into this final event.
Most importantly of all,
Imperial were sitting atop
the mixed league – a new
competition for this year
that combines the scores
of the women’s and men’s
team placings in races to
crown the ultimate overall
cross country squad.
Starting the day just 2
points clear of UCL meant
that everyone had to put
in a big race to ensure the
first name engraved on
the flashy new silverware
would be the ancient runes
of I-M-P-E-R-I-A-L.
After sunbathing as a
“Before they
knew it they
were off, flying
down the
back straight
of the Scrubs
like escaped
prisoners.”

trophy was

ACC.”
like escaped prisoners,
before the faux-convicts
took a sharp turn to take
them up towards some
thick foliage.
Amogst the navy and
red vests were a number
of candidates for overall
individual medals.
In the men’s race Niki
Faulkner was hoping to
jump up to the podium,
having raced three of four
previous races and with
everyone’s top four races
to score he was a strong
favourite for the silver
medal overall. Dubious
pre-race calculations sug-
gested a simple eleventh
place finish would guar-
antee the silver.
In the simultaneous
yet shorter women’s race,
Imperial star athletes Kate
Olding and Georgia Curry
were tied for gold going
into the race. With third
place in the league well
out of the running, this
final race was a straight
shootout for the gold. Both
athletes went into the race
carrying minor injuries
but were determined to do
everything to bring home
the fabled gold.
With four scoring
members for each team
it was also important that
the women’s squad had
sufficient depth to allow
the B team to outscore
Reading’s A team and
secure an unprecedented
double podium for the
women.
In the men’s race Niki
stormed home in third
with the A team packing
strongly: Oliver Newton
came 12th, Joe Pomfret
finished 16th, Henry Hart
17th, and Mihaly Ormay
22nd.
In the women’s race,
Georgia Curry was pipped
to the line by a St Mary’s
athlete, with the rest of the
top five filled by Imperi-
al’s Alex Mundell in third,
Chloe Baker in fourth,
and Alix Vermeulen in
fifth. The entire B team
also finished in the top 20!
All that was left of the
day was the prize-giving.
First were the individual
awards for the top-scor-
ing six athletes across
their best four races in
the league. Fresher Alix
Vermeulen was pleasantly
surprised to place fourth,
and was just three points
behind third. Kate Olding
was loudly cheered as she
collected her silver medal
after succumbing to an
unfortunate injury in the
final race, but that left the
gold medal which went
to Georgia Curry who
just pipped Kate to the
title by 2 points, scoring
a ludicrous 597 out of 600
points overall.
Over in the men’s, Niki
Faulkner recieved the
silver medal, finishing
just 2 points behind the
winning athlete from St
Mary’s with a total of 791
out of 800 points.
In the overall standings,
the women’s A teams and
B teams scored first and
third respectively, with
the A team receiving an
unnecessarily large shield.
The Men’s took home
the bronze medals before
the entire squad roared
when it was confirmed
they had won the inaugu-
ral Mike Baggs Trophy
for best mixed squad.
The gleaming trophy
was embraced by all team
members and paraded
around the Union later
that night at ACC.
Amazingly, it survived
the night and only time
will tell if ICXCAC will
be able to retain the trophy
in 2020.
