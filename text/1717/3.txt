Staffconsultedoverpensionsinbidtoavoid"undeniable
threat to jobs"
L
ecturers are once
again being
consulted about
the future of their
pensions as universities
prepare for a planned
increase in employer and
employee contributions
that is set to come into
force later this year.
With the 2017 valua-
tion of the Universities
Superannuation Scheme
(USS) concluded, uni-
versities have until 14th
March to respond to the
2018 valuation of the
pension scheme to which
most lecturers belong.
Imperial will circulate
its proposed response to
staff on Monday, with a
final meeting to be held
on Tuesday. A formal
response from the USS is
expected in early April.
USS is offering two
possibilities to overhaul
previous planned changes
that resulted in strikes and
industrial action at more
than 60 universities across
the country. The “upper
bookend” approach would
require total contributions
of 33.7% to maintain the
current benefits; 23% of
this would be paid by em-
ployers and the remaining
10.7% paid by employees.
Universities UK, which
represents the country’s
higher education institu-
tions, has claimed that this
would be “unsustainable”
and an “undeniable threat
to investment and to jobs”.
The “lower bookend”
approach would see
contributions set at 29.7%
(20.4% from employers
and 9.3% from employ-
ees). However, the USS is
only willing to adopt this
lower bookend approach
if additional contingent
contributions can be guar-
anteed in the event that
“market events caused
a further deterioration
in the recovery of the
deficit” (i.e. contribution
levels would increase if
funding for the scheme
significantly decreased).
As of March 2018, the
pension scheme was oper-
ating with a deficit of £3.6
billion.
Employers are now
being asked for their
views on these proposals,
as well as on the eleven
principles set out by
the USS under which it
would be “prepared to
consider” contingent con-
tributions. These include
the requirement for an
objective “trigger metric”
that will only bring
contingent contributions
into force in the event of
an “adverse scenario” (as
opposed to normal market
fluctuations); contingent
contributions to be set at
levels that will “substan-
tially improve the funding
position”; and a guarantee
that contingent contribu-
tions will be paid in full if
invoked. A letter to USS
chair Sir David Eastwood
from The Pensions Reg-
ulator confirmed that any
decision to move away
from the proposals that
arose from the 2017 val-
uation would need to be

“fully backed by addition-
al, tangible, and realisable
contingent support from
the employers”.
If no agreement is
reached between USS and
UUK, contributions will
increase in accordance
with results from the 2017
valuation. This would
mean a phased increase in
employer and employee
contributions beginning
in April this year. By April
2020, contributions would
total 35.6%, with 24.2%
coming from employers
and employee contribu-
tions making up the re-
maining 11.4%. Imperial
recognises that these rises
would be “unsustainable”
for many staff.
If – as UUK hopes –
the USS does adopt the
lower bookend approach,
the arrangements will be
time-limited. A report on
the long-term sustaina-
bility of the USS is due
in autumn; its findings
are likely to impact the
next valuation (currently
scheduled for 2021) and
could effectively “reset”
any decisions made
regarding contingent con-
tributions.

“leaky pipe” metaphor
as a key issue tackled by
500 Women Scientists.
The metaphor illustrates
the “leaking” of women
from the scientific talent
pipeline, starting from
high school science
classes (49% women) to
bachelor’s degrees (32%)
to PhDs (25%) to top
academic positions (only
11%).
This is due to the “in-
stitutional discrimination”
within science, where
the structural system for
advancing one’s scientific
career is built for only one
kind of person: a cis white
male. These discrimina-
tions take shape in the
form of unequal pay for
equal work, inadequate
family leave policies, and
workplace harassment.
These factors build upon
each other to pressure
women to leave the field
earlier.
Through 500 Women
Scientists (500WS),
Kelly and Co-founder
Jane Zelikova implement
solutions to institutional
discrimination, although
the full scope of the or-
ganisation’s work is much
broader and has expanded
beyond its original param-
eters. Kelly explains, “we
quickly evolved from our
reactionary beginnings
towards a broader mission
to serve society by making
science more open, inclu-
sive, and accessible.”
500WS provides re-
sources to its local chap-
ters, endearingly named
“pods”, such as ones
addressing “get out the
vote” initiatives, public
policy, ending workplace
harassment, and science
communication. They cat-
alyse change by providing
training, mentorships, and
public outreach opportu-
nities to members; they
actively try to promote
women into positions of
power and leadership, to
become award winners
or society presidents and
more; they aim to make
science accessible to
everyone through events
organised by local pods to
bring science to the com-
munity, such as family
night science camps. It is
through these approaches,
through crowdsourcing
and gritty determination,
that they want to transform
scientific institutions.
Felix sat down with
Kelly and Imperial
Department of Physics
research associate Dr.
Jessica Wade, who is also
known for her advocacy
for women scientists. Jess
writes biographies on
Wikipedia of impressive
women scientists whose
work have not been
celebrated or recognized
enough. Dr. Shini Somara,
host of the Scilence
podcast, that interviews
women in STEM about
the challenges of being
a woman in STEM, also
joined the discussion.
Felix: Has your
organization faced
any backlash or
resistance, or come
across people who
strongly disagree with
your mission?
Kelly: Yes. We are
women speaking out and
any woman who speaks
loud enough will get
backlash. Mostly from
emails or Twitter. The
benefit of our organisation
is that we do it behind the
500 Women Scientists
wall. For a lot of the stuff
we do, we sign it as 500
Women Scientists so
there’s not an individual.
Jess: After I called
someone out last year for
being a horrible sexist,
because he was, I got a
bunch of emails for about a
month every day, and also
handwritten letters sent in
these funny envelopes to
me at Imperial. Quite a
few very right-wing web-
sites took against me and
directed their hundreds
of thousands of horrible
people towards me as
well.
Kelly: We did an AMA
[Ask Me Anything] on
Reddit. Horrible. The
moderators running it,
under the science subred-
dit, were unprepared
for how many nasty
comments there would
be and they had to bring
in way more moderators
than they ever had to with
any other science AMA. It
was horrific.
Jess: You’ll always
get haters, that’s fine, I
don’t care. If they liked
me, I’d be worried. That’s
generally had to be my
approach to it. The back-
lashes that upset you more
are the ones where, pro-
fessionally, people may
not take you as seriously
because you care about
this kind of stuff.
How does someone
who is being
sexually harassed, or
someone who feels
discriminated against
because they’re a
woman, speak up in
the workplace?
Kelly: It’s really hard.
Some institutions are
going to be better about
it than others. If you’re
lucky, you’ll have a
supervisor that you can
go talk to and share your
experience with, and who
will be there to support
you through the process.
Jess: I think that’s the
tricky thing, that the ma-
jority of places, take the
UK, don’t have any policy
to protect people who are
suffering this.
When I came in, I
noticed a lack of men
in the room. I think
there was only 1,
maybe 2 [the crowd
ratio was 1 male to 15
females]. How do you
affect real change, if
you are having these
conversations but
only women are there,
and women already
know the problems?
Kelly: I don’t think
all women already know
the problems. I think
some women know, the
majority probably “feel
like something’s off”. I
think that’s true for a lot
of women, especially
younger women. There
are women who are just
completely unaware
and they’re probably in
a very nice position of
privilege, so they haven’t
been confronted with a
challenge, so why would
they know?
Jess: I think there are
really great men, espe-
cially at Imperial, who
are really championing
the cause. I think Stephen
Curry’s position [Assis-
tant Provost (Equality,
Diversity, Inclusion)] is
so, so, so important. I
do think men have to be
involved, and it’s very
similar to the kind of
conversation about the
lack of minority ethnic
academics, right? It can’t
only be on the few black
professors already there to
speak up; it can’t be up to
them to fix that for all of
the other black students
coming through, you have
to have other people doing
it.
20 years ago, there
were 5% of the
professors at Imperial
were women. That
rose to 15% in 2009.
Since 2009, it’s only
increased by 1%, so
it’s going a step in the
right direction but
the pace of change is
extremely, extremely
slow.
Jess: I think it’s
departmental. You have
departments like Medi-
cine with 50-50 men and
women and that’s because
people take it really seri-
ously. The Athena Swan
Award is great because it
was pretty terrible before
for women academics.
It makes people collect
data and to try and initiate
practices to better support
underrepresented commu-
nities and that’s always
a good thing. You can’t
get funding in Medical
sciences unless you
have at least the Athena
Swan Silver, that’s had a
really, really big impact
and that’s why you have
50-50.
Do you know the
gender ratio of
students at Imperial?
Jess: Physics is about
20-25%. Really interest-
ingly, Physics A-Level is
20-25% girls and Physics
at university is 20-25%
girls, so the girls who
do Physics A Level are
the only ones doing it at
university. No-one does
it as just a “hey cool, the
universe is fun, I’m going
to do it as a side project”,
“It doesn’t
matter what
you do. You
will always get
haters”
and that’s really sad.
Kelly: That just high-
lights that each different
discipline has a different
challenge. In my field,
biology and ecology,
through undergrad and
grad it's 50-50, but there’s
just a huge drop-off for
postdocs and then for pro-
fessors, whereas Physics
already starts with a drop-
off.
Jess: I think we really
need to get better at how
we talk about it. Women
leaving isn’t because they
are leaving and failing,
it’s because every single
job in the whole world
wants to employ academic
women scientists. When
you finish your degree
here you can choose to
do a PhD if you want,
but consultancy will want
you, investment banks
will want you, policy will
want you, people will beg
for you to teach. There are
so many different career
options that you can do
and you can go into one
