Imperial College Union President
Junrui Wang
B
eing a Union
President does
not make one-
self special from
others, no matter how
talented he/she may be
in their own field; Being
a Union President does
not give oneself power to
reject others' requests, no
matter how small the thing
you think to be. Being a Union President means the re-
sponsibility, the responsibility that others may regard as
drudgery but you consider as the source of happiness.
Being a Union President means sacrifice, sacrificing the
time which you may have used to amuse yourself rather
than help others.Being a Union President means being
equal, for which you are standing on the behalf of all
students you represent and what you do must represent
the interest of majority.This job is going to be hard and
not to be easy. It is not a causal game to simply play
with. It means responsibility, means the desire to help
others, to stand for your group, to stand for the profits
of all people involved, and it means you have been de-
termined to listen to all the feedback from students that
you represent, to present each students' ideas equally,
and to treat others warmly.I often ask myself , 'Do you
think you can take this heavy task?'. It is hard, I have to
admit, and there might be some difficulties that I have
never met; but I promise that I will try my best and
spare no effort to make imperial a better place.

here are several
issues to address
to improve the
experience for
our 17,000 students. This
is why I am running for
Union President - to
lead positive change for
ALL students. Through
my work on Constituent
Unions as the RCSU
President and Treasurer,
CSP Committees, and as a
Departmental Representative, I have led on a number of
initiatives that have benefited students now, and in the
future. My goals are:
• Save Our Services & Back our Bars - Improve
commercial services rather than cut them and
keep major facilities (Reynolds/h-bar/Union
Bar) open.
• Support Constituent Unions - Support and Grow
the Constituent Unions (RCSU, ICSM, CGCU,
RSM & GSU), so that they are celebrated and at
the centre of the student experience.
• Create Campus Coordination - Provide the
opportunity for students at all campuses to feel
engaged with the student community and get
involved in all union activities.
• Champion CSP volunteers - Reduce the level of
administrative work for volunteers so they can
focus on being involved in the Club/Society/
Project they love.
• Develop Direct Democracy - Implement methods
that makes Union Council more accessible and
effective in applying solutions to issues affecting
students.
• Fix the NSS Mess - Work to raise issues to
College that are frequently mentioned in the
NSS survey, and ensure they are fixed. College,
like the Union, should be proactive in improving
the student experience.
• Increase Counselling Support - Improve on
waiting times for the Student Counselling
service, increasing provisions and support they
can provide to students.

fter I talked
about my work-
ing purpose
and feasible
plan to our now union
president Rob and some
international students, I
get my final manifesto:
1. Although there will
be BREXIT at the
end of this month,
Imperial and the student union will be same
"European and Global", continue to focus on
provide a good environment for EU and interna-
tional students.
2. I will lead the union to suggest Uni to invite
more sponsors to provide different degrees of
small scholarships, in return, the union can help
them hold different forms of job fairs.
3. Organizing more events can be held on campus
for different groups to create a more conducive
environment for people of different beliefs and
sexual orientations to live and study, that, such
as e-sports competitions, so that more students
can enrich their spare time and find their own
interests
4. To submit a formal letter to suggest Uni and
government to extend the duration of the student
visa, so that more international students can feel
the inclusiveness of the school and the UK, and
get more job opportunities
5. To suggest Uni for more flexible options for
failing grades. For example, if you only failed in
one exam, you may could get a merit or distinc-
tion if you have an average final grade more than
60 or 70, but if you failed more than one, that
means you only can get a pass.

i Fellow Learner! Thank you for considering to vote for me, to improve educational experience and outcomes at Imperial for ALL
students.Imperial's new Teaching and Learning Strategy promises to enhance the educational experience & quality for students.
There is significant funding for department-wide curricula and pedagogic transformation. It is imperative that this translates to a
better learning experience and outcomes for all students.
Assessment & Feedback: The National Student Survey (NSS 2018) and Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES 2018) scored 64%
and 58% respectively in this area. These are worrying figures and I will work hard with departments to ensure clear assessment criteria and
quality, timely feedback.
Student Engagement in Curriculum Reviews:We are currently undergoing UG & PG Curriculum Review with implementation imminent.
Moving forwards, it will be critical to have student engagement in this process, particularly from postgrad taught students.
Ensure Accurate Reporting: The college intends to evaluate and research innovations in education, and to publish outcomes. I will make
sure reporting is done in a reliable and transparent manner; moreover, to ensure that innovations result in a better student experience.
Postgraduate Research Experience: Often a neglected part of the Imperial community. I will make sure "innovations in education" are also
applied to the PhD student experience. This includes offering services and experiences to the other Imperial campuses.

i, I'm Jerry Li (aka. Junhua Li) and I am a 3rd
year Aeronautical Engineer, the current Vice
President Technology for Investment society
and, for the past two years, Ambassador
for Anime society. Imperial's clubs and societies are
the highlight of our university life, yet the Union's
supporting processes and technologies are inefficient
and inadequate. We process some of our processes 30%
slower than other universities. We use decade-old soft-
ware to manage mailing lists. We even did some of our
room bookings manually, unlike many other London
universities. Makes you think, right? Don't just think, act: I have detailed solutions
to modernise the Union's technologies and processes. Vote Jerry to make the Union
modern again!
SCRAP THE PAPERWORK
• Implement a new automated room booking process, including easier ad hoc
bookings
• Invest in a major overhaul in the Union's technology stack
• Standardise and simplify Union forms, eg. External Speaker and Financial
Transaction applications; expedite Union processes by reducing paperwork
EXPAND THE RESOURCES
• Review the resources (rooms, minicars, storage) and seek to put underutilised
resources to use
• Pressure the College to release more activity/storage space for CSP use
A MORE RESPONSIVE UNION
• At least 4 hours per week for walk-in query sessions
• An open online forum to track the problem-solving progress
• Regular dev-blogs on the progress of my initiatives
• Regular visits to CSP activities to solve problems on the site

P
lease consider the environment before printing
this recycled manifesto. Also, I might distrib-
ute cheese and chicken nuggets as part of my
campaign if I can be bothered (DeAdLiNeS),
so keep your eyes peeled for that on Facebook.(EDIT:
I've just read #ice8496, thank you to the K-Pop studies
student who submitted that (3)
. If I'm elected, I'll person-
ally make sure that a K-Pop society gets set up because
I won't be '[a] nob [who can't] figure out that Hallyu
and KSoc have different goals'.)Here is a list of some
of the cheeses I most enjoy:- Halloumi (on the subject,
do check out Halloumi Memes for the Gloomy Teens on Facebook (1)
- great OC)-
RoulÃ©- Wensleydale- Smoked Gouda- ComtÃ©- GruyÃ¨re- Danbo- Babybel
original I dislike vegan cheese, however, I support veganism continuing to be legal
in the United Kingdom.I am always open to recommendations for new cheeses to try.
Iff I am elected, please feel free to get in touch to suggest some, as well as good wine
pairings for those among you who are (trying to be) more bourgeois (2)
. Please also
feel free to add me on LinkedIn. I believe that a large number of connections helps to
compensate for my lack of personality.

I
'm Tom and over the last couple of years, I've been
oneofyourBarManagersattheUnion,tennispresi-
dent and now Sports (ACC) Chair. Extra-curricular
activities are a key part of the student experience,
yet our volunteers aren't supported enough, nor do they
have sufficient resources available to shape their clubs
the way they'd like. Being responsible for 55+ clubs
and having been engaged with students throughout my
time at Imperial, I believe I have the experience and
know-how to help our volunteers achieve their goals.
*NEW SPORTS COMPLEX*
Our current sports facilities at Heston/Harlington are
outdated and not fit for purpose. Pressure College to
action tackling this and get new sports grounds.
*PROMOTE CSPs' ACTIVITIES*
Introduce regular 'Arts & Entertainment Nights'
Create student-led committees for Union-wide events (e.g. Summer Ball) so YOU
shape the student experience
Advertise clubs & societies' events through the Union's publicity channels
*IMPLEMENT THE NEW ATHLETICS UNION*
Introduce 35+ clubs to the Sports Hub
Introduce a one-off payment fee, making sports cheaper for all
Undertake a kit review and secure a new supplier for all sports clubs
*IMPROVE SPACES & PROCESSES*
Revamp the training available to club officers and streamline budgeting
Implement a more effective room booking system for annual allocations
*BETTER CONSULTATION & STUDENT INCLUSION*
Implement the feedback from over 3,000 responses in the Student Experience
Survey, and ensure student voices are heard.
Review Postgrad and non-SK-campus activity within CSPs to improve engage-
ment
Open invite 'town hall' style progress meetings
