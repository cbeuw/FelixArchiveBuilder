Smash Corner-Piranha Plant, leader of the Plant Gang
H
e is Sakurai’s
Christmas pres-
ent to every
Smash player,
the character no one ex-
pected but now everybody
loves, we are of course
talking about the very first
DLC fighter of Ultimate,
#70 in the roster, Piranha
Plant.
First appearing in 1985
intheoriginalSuperMario
Bros, he is the infamous
generic enemy that lives
in the green pipes of the
Mushroom Kingdom.
Appearing in many games
of the Mario franchise
after, Piranha Plant has
paved his way into history
by becoming the newest
fighter in Super Smash
Bros. Ultimate, available
for free to all players who
bought the game before
the 31st of January. He in-
stantly won the love of the
community as a close to
mid-range character with
such a smooth gameplay
feeling as well as unique
new abilities to offer.
With his teeth and
leaves, Piranha Plant
has decent close-range
combat capability both on
the ground and in the air.
In particular, his side- and
up-smash are both very
fast and powerful with a
generous hitbox, making
it easy to hit your target
out of the park. Then,
when in the air, you can
do either his neutral to
get nice safe damage or
his back-air to end them
with a fiery blast. Another
notable finisher is his
up-throw, which will kill
reliably above 150% if
you manage to grab an
opponent wandering too
close.
Piranha Plant is also
fantastic for mid-range
combat, with his special
abilities being able to dish
out the damage from the
comfort of his pot.
His neutral is his
Ptooie, an attack you
can hold to blow out a
spike ball above his head,
which can be then thrown
on either side with a
directional input. Difficult
to use at first, but, if you
hit an opponent it can kill
them from 100%!
Then it’s his side-spe-
cial Poison Breath, a
charged attack where
Piranha Plant spits out a
thick nauseous cloud of
poison in front of him,
which won’t stagger his
opponents but will deal an
insane amount of damage
if they stay in it.
His down option is
the Long-Stem Strike,
another charged attack
where he extends his neck
to perform a long-range
bite to finish his enemies.
Finally, his up-special
is the Piranhacopter, an
easily steerable recovery
tool which can travel
both a great vertical and
horizontal distance.
Now he may be new the
roster, but Piranha Plant
playershavealreadyfound
some cheeky combos and
techniques with him. The
first is a simple use of
Ptooie to ledge guard your
opponent. If you position
Piranha Plant just on the
edge of the map hold
down your neutral-spe-
cial, it will keep floating in
the air and block any high
recovery. Furthermore, if
they instead want to attack
you whilst climbing back
on the stage, you can drop
the spike ball and hit them
back off-stage. Another
general technique is the
‘Camouflage’, a great
way to confuse your
opponent by hiding
behind the dense poison
of your side-special to
surprise your enemy with
an unseen attack, such as
your Long-Stem Strike.
So even if originally
nobody even considered
Piranha Plant to ever be a
fighter for Smash, Sakurai
has impressed everyone
by making a creative
and well-designed char-
acter. His overall decent
moveset brings him only
up to mid-tier but his
unique tools make him
very fun to play. I hence
highly suggest you join
the Plant Gang to slash
and bite your way to
victory.
Smash Corner-Rosalina & Luna, Fighting Stars
T
his powerful duo
first appeared in
2010 as a myste-
rious character of
SuperMarioGalaxyonthe
Wii. They are relatively
new to the series, having
only appeared once before
in the Wii U version of the
game. While not being as
powerful as her previous
iteration, there is still
plenty of room to show
off with this complex
2-in-1 package.
The unique aspect of
Rosalina and Luma comes
from Luma copying all
of Rosalina’s attacks.
Whether Luma is close
(by default) or far (after
using Luma shot, the
neutral special) she will
function as a second
character you can control.
This allows for amazing
mix-ups and should be
practiced a lot in order
to maximise potential. A
common way of utilising
this is sending out Luma,
and then grabbing the
opponent. Rather than
throwing the opponent,
instead, pummel them and
once they are released,
they will float towards
Luma, if you use an up
smash at high percent this
will result in a kill.
Their up B ‘Launch
Star’ is a useful yet
exploitable recovery.
Although it has a very
large range, the trajectory
it takes is not very ma-
nipulatable and thus easy
to predict and punish. Be
careful when using this as
once Rosalina is off-stage
without a jump, she is at a
massive disadvantage due
to her slow fall speed and
lightweight, meaning she
is very easy to kill.
The other two special
moves are quite situa-
tional. Star Bits is their
side B which shoots out a
small cluster of stars from
Luma. This has quite low
damage and no knockback
so is only useful when
trying to stop the enemy
going back to the ledge or
if you want to jab lock the
opponent. Gravitational
Pull is their down B which
has two uses: It pulls
Luma back to Rosalina
after being fired out by
a Luma shot and it also
absorbs projectiles. This
is very useful as it allows
easier control of Luma, as
well as giving Rosalina
a good tool to deal with
projectile users.
The main strength of
Rosalina comes in her
powerful aerial attacks,
especially up air. You can
hit most of her aerials out
of a throw, so a common
play is to up throw the
opponent into a string
of up airs. Hitting the
opponent with Luma’s
up air (rather than Rosali-
na’s) will cause far more
knockback and damage
and often leads to a K.O.
The key with Rosalina
and Luma is to be patient.
You have enough tools to
helpgetyououtofpressure
(gravitational pull is great
against projectiles and all
of Luma’s attacks have a
huge amount of priority)
meaning that if you wait
until the right moment
to strike you will be able
to massively punish the
opponent.
Overall, I would rank
Peach’s Daughter (we
think) solidly in mid-tier.
Although this duo has
powerful kill potential and
punish game, the fact that
they are so light means
they can be knocked out
far too easily. Not only
this but if Luma sustains
enough damage she can
be knocked out herself
leaving Rosalina screwed
as she loses most of what
makes her strong.
If you want to find out
more about how to play
Rosalina and Luma at a
high level I recommend
you check out ‘Falln’ a
professional player with
decent results. Happy
Smashing!
