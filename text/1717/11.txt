All in Good Time: In Due Course But Without Haste
Written by Bill
Naughton in the 60s, All
in Good Time follows
the story of young new-
ly-weds Arthur and Violet
as they negotiate the be-
ginnings of married life.
But money is tight and
they are forced to move
in with Arthur’s good-na-
tured but overbearing
parents. Laden with
innuendo, the storyline
becomes increasingly
ridiculous, with everyone
from nosy neighbours to
loud snorers getting in the
way of the couple having
any privacy at all...
What could have been
a truly cringe-worthy
experience was rendered
outright funny. Rohan
Mitta played a suitably
awkward and troubled
Arthur, making an endear-
ingly naive couple with
his new wife Violet, bril-
liantly played by Maddie
Roche.
Arthur’s ever-present
parents, played by Olivia
Revans and Christian
Burton, made a brilliant
pair, authentically setting
the scene in mid-20th
century Bolton. This
was further impressed
on the audience through
a fantastic set, designed
by Thomas Allen, which
gave the audience a prime
view into the bedroom,
removing any sense
that the couple had any
privacy at all.
A stellar performance
came from Calum
Drysdale, who played
a charismatic Geoffrey
Fritton, and a special
mention to Georgie Davis
as a brilliantly funny
Molly Thompson. With
impressive acting across
the board, hats off to
Director Harriet Powell
and Asst. Director May
McCool and the Produc-
tion Team for a highly
entertaining Friday night.

Come From Away
O
f all the shows
I’ve been lucky
enough to see
recently, Come
From Away is arguably
the most important one.
Daring to deal with a
topic as sensitive as 9/11,
Come From Away is a sur-
prisingly feel-good show,
while being executed
absolutely tastefully.
Based on a real story,
this musical tells a (previ-
ously) little-known story
of human kindness in
times of need. Following
the devastating attacks
on September 11th
2001
that resulted in the deaths
of almost 3000 people,
American airspace was
shut; this resulted in 38
planes carrying nearly
7000 passengers to be
diverted to a small town
in Canada called Gander,
whose population size
was to suddenly double.
The locals embrace the
newcomers, providing
food, shelter and clothes,
while forging unique
bonds in the face of their
unique situation.
What makes the show
the emotional juggernaut
that it is isn’t simply
its setting but also the
way the show brilliantly
explores the intricate ways
each character is affected
by the events that lead to
their current situation; a
Muslim passenger con-
stantly being subject to
judgemental looks and a
thorough full body search,
a mother desperately
waiting to hear from her
son who is a firefighter in
New York City, as well as
a pregnant chimpanzee!
The themes of hope,
desperation, grief and
love are touched on beau-
tifully through a score
that is catchy, consistent
and touching throughout.
Having been familiar with
the music prior to seeing
the show, it wouldn’t be
out of line to say that the
music, which is brilliant in
its own right, is elevated
by the staging.
Come From Away is
a true company musical,
with 12 cast members
alternating from roles as
Gander locals to roles
as “the plane people”.
Although at first, I
thought this would get
confusing or tedious, this
approach works miracu-
lously well, as with the
addition of a hat or a coat,
the characters transform
into completely different
people in the blink of an
eye. Although this can
in part be attributed to
the acting abilities of the
individual cast members,
the direction deserves
some of the credit in
making this as seamless
as it is. The show is so
slick and looks so simple
that it is easy to overlook
the level of complexity of
such in-sync scene and
character transitions.
Although it is extreme-
ly hard to choose standout
cast members, Rachel
Tucker, whose roles
include Beverly Bass,
the first female captain at
American Airlines, who
piloted one of the planes
landing at Gander, gets
to perform the show’s
only solo number, an
emotional piece exploring
Bass’s passion for flying,
and her feelings towards
what has taken place.
Tucker performs the piece
beautifully, and the scene
works wonderfully as one
of the emotional climaxes
of the show.
A one-act show just
short of two hours, Come
From Away is able to say
all it needs to say without
diluting the message with
unnecessary sequences,
or a break to take away
from the intensity of the
performance. This is not
only a show that reflects
on the events on 9/11,
but one that is as relevant
as ever in these divisive
times.
