C
G stocks tend
to be low-inno-
vation, mature
companies that
rely on big brands and
timeless products and pay
regular dividends. As de-
fensive stocks, CG stocks
are more likely to outper-
form in bear markets than
in bull markets. In recent
years, CG stocks have
widely underperformed
in the broader market for
several reasons. Investors
have become enamored
with tech stocks, such
as the FAANG group,
that have consistently
outperformed. Rising
interest rates have also
made bonds more ap-
pealing to conservative,
income-seeking investors,
leading them to take some
money out of dividend-
paying consumer staples.
Finally, higher input costs
have threatened some CG
stocks. Most of the CG
ETFs* have underper-
formed the S&P 500 over
the past five years.
But the past is no guide
to the future. Over the
coming decade, upheavals
in global market will
likely to produce as many
losers as winners. Asia
will overtake the West
as the main consumer
market, and it will
demand new levels of
value and innovation
from companies. Rising
Internet penetration
could upend traditional
sales models. Change is
nothing new for the retail
sector; those that adapt
to customers’ evolving
needs and demands
around technology and
service will be ones that
thrive. It is worth thinking
about how company can
unlock the value-creation
potential and individuals
The rise of digital
consumers
In the United Kingdom,
over 80 percent of UK
internet users online shop.
In China, the online retail
market has soared past
$1.1trillionin2018.While
technology has played a
key role in the consumer
goods industry’s growth,
it will be truly disruptive
in the coming decade.
But while retailers are
under increasing pressure,
the picture is not bleak
for all. Grocery retailers
are experiencing robust
growth in an inflationary
environment, while the
nimbler, pure-online
players continue to grow
market share. In figuring
out how to win in this new
digital world, companies
face some major strategic
questions - including
how to build a successful
business through online
retail channels, how
to build brands and
categories in a socially
networked world, and how
to understand consumers
more deeply and connect
with them more often.
Moreover, digital
marketing is no longer a
one-way communication
to consumers. Social
media provides an
important channel for
companies to “listen” to
consumers without biases.
For example, Unilever
used co-creation with
its online community
to develop Axe Twist, a
fragrance that changes
throughout the day.
The shift of value
The global financial
crisis has driven
consumers to value
offerings, and it is a trend
that is likely to stick. The
shift to value has major
implications for the CG
industry’s profit formula.
Notleast,itcoulderodethe
pricing power of brands.
Private-label players are
riding the value trend,
accounting for more than
a key concern for retailers.
However, consumers,
millennials in particular,
increasingly favour
smaller, niche brands
with environmentally
sustainable products.
E-commerce has also
opened up new selling and
advertising channels for
upstart brands, which have
challenged traditional
leaders such as P&G’s
Gillette. Such companies
are also threatened by
rising private-label sales
from retail giants such as
Amazon.
[* Investment funds

and trades as a stock,
that investors looking for
exposure across the sector
can choose from.]
can seek for investment
opportunities in these
following trends that are
highly likely to shape the
future of the CG sector.
Let’s now consider each
trend in turn.
A billion new
c o n s u m e r s
in emerging
markets
In the coming years,
the growth of emerging
markets will continue
to outstrip that of the
developed world by a wide
margin. The emerging
countries in Asia—most
notably China, India,
and Indonesia, had a
significant share of global
growth (18%) in the
last decade. The global
middle class will expand
dramatically: by 2020, it
is expected that more than
a billion new consumers
spending between $10
and $100 per day.
Companies that
understand and meet these
new consumers’ needs
will earn tremendous
competitive advantage.
Success factors include
the selection of categories,
markets and segmenting
the billion new consumers
and innovating to meet
their needs. Consider
the example of Wrigley
chewing gum in China:
the company has captured
40 percent of a fast-
growing category worth
$2 billion. Its tactics
include regular launches
of products tailored to
Chinese consumers,
including gum flavored
with herbal essences
and grapefruit; intensive
consumer education
emphasizing the health
benefits of chewing gum;
and building a presence
in the millions of small
outlets where Chinese
consumers typically shop.

lobally, of all
new bridges
opened in the
last five years,
50% was built in China.
Chinese investment has
also funded numerous
engineering projects
in Europe; from an
engineering standpoint,
China matters deeply.
If your ambition is to
design a bridge in the
next ten years, work from
Shanghai! At the LSESU
Emerging Markets Forum
this year we have panels
and keynotes directly
addressing the rise of
Chinese investment
in their Belt and Road
Initiative, a fantastic
opportunity to participate
in discussion with world-
leading speakers.
For example, what
could the recent dam
collapse in Brazil do to
the mining industry?
It is possible that the
government will be forced
by angry voters to impose
more stringent rules on the
use of mud dams (holding
heavy metal waste), which
could greatly increase
costs. This would have a
direct effect on Western
developed technologies.
Disasters like this dam
collapse also prompt
questions about entirely
new solutions. Should we
be looking further away
from traditional emerging
market industries like
fossil fuel and commodity
production? At the
Forum this year there’s a
panel on Future Energy,
discussing how we could
see a global shift into
renewable energies and
carbon neutral production
strategies. With climate
change apporaching
dangerous levels, this
is an area of paramount
importance. Your voices
matter: in a few years
you may be in a position
to develop globally
significant technologies-
come and hear what
problems the industry is
currently facing.
A question for you:
Are you into coding?
We have a workshop
designed to explore the
skills needed in electronic
trading - specifically the
big data reliant machine
learning strategies that
are currently being tested
in agricultural trading!
Emerging Markets will be
the next expansion point
for automated markets -
this workshop is a brilliant
chance to engage with
professionals from the
industry, to find out what
skills they prioritize and
how you could use them.
These markets are more
open for technological
solutions as well: banking
apps and blockchain
currency has been tested
in Sub-Saharan rural
areas, regions where
historically individuals
have had no access to
financial services. This
has had a huge effect on
gender inequality in the
area - women are able to
manage their own finances
with much greater ease.
I would argue that the
opportunity to develop
more basic forms of
technological systems that
may well be implemented
in our own markets is
crucial to working out
what effect they could
have on our economies.
The Forum also has a
panel dedicated to China
and its development of
Artificial Intelligence,
a discussion of its risks
and potential in economic
development. AI has
been a controversial topic
recently, the harvesting of
big data now undergoing
close scrutiny. What are
your views? Should we
be worried, or should we
embrace the opportunities
afforded by machine
learning? This is your
chance to ask questions
directly to those involved
in the AI expansion: what
do they think of how it
will affect our lives?
The LSE Emerging
Markets Forum is the
perfect place to start to
approachthesetopics,with
hundreds of like-minded
students and amazing
speakers sharing ideas and
learning from industry
leading professionals.
We’d love to see you
there on March 15th and
16th for an inspiring
discussion, thought-
provoking workshops and
networking opportunities
with our fantastic
speakers.
On the other hand, mining
companies pay a gigantic
proportion of Brazil’s
domestic income in
tax - can the government
really afford to anger
them? Debates that may
seem a world away will
have a direct impact on
us, whatever career or
position we find ourselves
in.
