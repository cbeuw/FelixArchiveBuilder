Imperial College Union President
Abhijay Sood
I
'm Abs. For three
years, I've worked
to improve things
at Imperial. As an
academic rep, I fought
to end the zero-tolerance
policy on late coursework,
and for a Life Sciences
common room. I brought
paid 4th
year undergrad-
uate teaching assistants
to my department, giving first-years extra support.
I've been on the RCSU's executive committee, and
currently sit on Trustee Board, overseeing finances and
governance across the Union. I'm running for Union
President because for all its strengths, Imperial could
do much more for us. Student services are cut every
year despite our ~£80m surplus. I've seen first-hand
how far-reaching changes to our degrees can be made
without consulting students, or even academic staff.
The Union behaves similarly, with bureaucratic hurdles
making engagement difficult, and students excluded
from decision-making.This needs to change. I believe
together, we can:
FIX THE UNION:
• Pay student staff the London Living Wage, in
line with other London universities
• Get the room-booking system automated- Resist
proposed cuts to Reynolds bar
• Improve transparency: keep students informed
regarding major decisions
CHALLENGE THE UNIVERSITY:
• Take a stand against cuts to catering outlets (e.g.
h-bar) and other student services
• Fight for student space and a stronger counsel-
ling provision
• End unethical investments
My plan to change Imperial is simple: increase
student representation on high-level College commit-
tees. I am already working towards this with senior aca-
demics. With this approach, we can improve all areas of
university life, from campus services to our curricula.
For meaningful change, #voteAbs for Union President.

A
nother year,
same old
u n i c o r n .
Where was
our president when
meat-free mondays were
introduced? Where was
our president when H-bar
stopped serving food?
Where was our pre - No,
my dear students, we have
been alone all these years.
Inability of the union to
understand how student volunteering works nearly
resulted in cancellation of one of the biggest (and most
profitable) student led events. What next? Derailing
student societies? Students voice has not been taken
into account for far too long. I campaign for the many,
not for the next-to-no-one. I will fight for your right
to prosperity, truth, and bliss.Hardest choices require
strongest wills. It will never be easy to realize that one
unicorn makes more sense than an entire sabbatical
team this year. But once you do, there is no way back.
There is so much more I want to write, but this margin
is too small to contain it. Let my actions speak louder
than any words. Make ICU great. For once.Endorsed by
Paul Balaji and balanced well with some memes. As all
things should be.

O
kay, starter
for 10: When
did Imperial
College last win
University Challenge?
2001. Next year's freshers
will be the first to join the
College that were born
after this historic moment.
Imperial deserves better.
#ThisPrezCan
• Ensure all students
have University
Challenge training and in 2020 - It's Coming
Home.
Now the bonus questions: How will we improve
student satisfaction?
#ThisPrezCan
• Award every student a First Class degree which
will serve to end grade inflation and boost both
graduate employment and student satisfaction.
#ThisPrezCan
• Build a slide around the outside of Queen's
Tower to help students with stress relief.
#ThisPrezCan
• Abolish lectures before midday to allow all
students to visit Metric every night which will
also swell the Union's coffers.
What about the economy?
#ThisPrezCan
• Raise the Union President's salary to the same
as College President Alice Gast's - £433,000.00.
This 'Gastly pay-packet' will be paid for by the
booming economic polices detailed in this ful-
ly-costed manifesto.
#ThisPrezCan
• Levy a tax on coughing in lectures.
#ThisPrezCan
• Launch an Imperial Cryptocurrency - Coiny Mc-
CoinFace - which will appreciate in value faster
than Gast's bonus to soften the blow of tuition
fees courtesy of Machine Learning.
Any other polices?
#ThisPrezCan
• Restore credibility to Ethos by banning more
scandalous U-turns.
#ThisPrezCan
• Promise there will be no hard border with the
White City campus due to the Acton backstop.
#ThisPrezCan
• Move South Kensington tube station closer to
campus.
#ThisPrezCan
• Demolish the Union Offices and replace them
with an ivory tower.
#ThisPrezCan
• Adopt a real cat for the Felix Editor.

T
his is democ-
racy manifest.
Corruption has
plagued our
university for too long.
In the beginning we were
assured that we could
speak to the managers. We
were lied to. Instead we
were apprehended against
our will. Our dignity was
shattered by the great skill
the apprehender had in
martial arts. They knew their Judo well. I pledge to end
this madness and crush this corruption from the top. I
pledge to dissolve the union and donate my £30000 to
charity. I also pledge to vastly improve the range and
quality of Chinese food on campus. I will even try my
hardest to ensure the food is free. No longer will we by
charged for eating succulent Chinese meals. Tata and
farewell
