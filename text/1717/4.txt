O
h no, it’s an-
other article
about bursaries
in Imperial!
Though I can’t promise to
be brief, I do promise that
this is the last you’ll hear
about it, from me, at least.
I’ll begin with the
same preface given to
every discussion of the
bursary: genuine praise
for the Imperial bursary
scheme as a whole.
College never tires of
reminding us that the
Imperial bursary scheme
is amongst the most
generous in the country,
and nor should they –
it’s one of the very best
and most commendable
things about Imperial.
Never mind the stellar
research or the star
academics; far more
impressive is how the
university tries, through
the bursary, to afford
their poorest students
a university experience
on par with their richer
peers.
It’s worth bearing
these avowedly good
intentions in mind when
thinking about my topic
today. A primer: the
bursary entitlement for
low-income students has
changed several times
over the last few years.
The UG cohort entering
Imperial in 2015 noticed
that those in the £35,000-
£60,000 income
brackets received
substantially less – by
nearly £2000 a year in
some cases – than they
would have received
had they enrolled a year
earlier under the 2014-
entry bursary scheme.
Analysis by Imperial
College Union showed
that students in these
“squeezed middle”
brackets were now
falling below College’s
estimate for the cost of
living in London as a
result. A total overhaul
of the bursary structure
followed, to ensure that
every bursary recipient
could – through a com-
bination of maintenance
loans, bursaries, and
family contributions –
afford to live and study
in Imperial. From 2016
onwards, students in
these middle-income
brackets would again
receive several thou-
sands more per year than
they would under the
2015 bursary scheme,
and in theory everyone
could afford to study at
Imperial – hurray!
The problem was
fixed, then – so what?
Well, not quite. The
catch is that the changes
were not retrospective;
once you’re on a particu-
lar bursary scheme, you
stay on it (provided your
household income con-
tinues to fall below the
threshold). This means
that those students who
signed on the dotted line
in 2015 as incoming
freshers have continued
to be short-changed for
the duration of their
degrees. Many of those
affected graduated last
year, and most of the rest
– including me – will
graduate in 3 months’
time, often having
received in the region of
£8000-£10,000 less over
the course of the degree
than students a year
older or younger.
This is not a small
amount of money, even
to those in the higher
brackets of the bursary
scheme. Bursary recipi-
ents comprise the bottom
third of home students
by household income.
For reference, a house-
hold of two Imperial
graduates would expect
to be bringing in close
to £75,000 only 12
months after graduating,
way above even the top
bursary bracket (and
over double the lowest
household income of
those affected).
Let’s estimate how
much money this would
have cost Imperial to
address. There were
around 160 affected
students when I brought
this issue to the uni-
versity’s attention over
two years ago in a
Alternatively, the
affected students could
have been shifted onto
the previous 2014
bursary scheme. This
would be a cheaper
option, with the biggest
cut in the 2015 scheme
compared to its pre-
decessor being around
£1900 a year (this time
for those in the £40,000-
£45,000 income
bracket). A more modest
£300,000 or so would
be enough to cover this.
Of course, these are all
upper bounds for the
cost of rectifying the sit-
uation; in reality, most
students would stand to
receive less than this,
and the cost to College
would be a lot lower.
I hoped that my
Council paper would
draw the attention of
College management
to what I assumed was
an honest error in their
calculations, something
that had been overlooked
by people with the best
of intentions. I hoped
that we’d ultimately
receive a bursary in line
with College’s cost of
living calculations; at
the very least, I hoped
it would be the start of
a conversation between
College and the affected
students.
What followed instead
was a tersely-worded
dismissal, followed by
two and a half years of…
nothing. I thought that
perhaps College would
reach out to those of us
affected, either directly
– they knew who they
were paying, after all –
or through the Union.
Sadly, this never came. I
chased it up initially but
my initial hopefulness
was steadily diminished

With the advent of the
new scheme in 2016,
students in the £45,000-
£50,000 income bracket
would receive £3100
more per year than those
in the 2015 scheme.
If every one of the
affected students was
in this bracket, it would
cost College around
£500,000 a year to fix
the problem. A pretty
serious sum of money,
then, but remember that
the 2016 scheme is the
one devised by College
themselves to ensure
that every bursary recip-
ient could afford to live
in London.

by each hurried meeting
and vague promise. Like
most students who were
affected, I eventually
abandoned all hope that
there would ever be a
resolution.
*
That’s where we were
until January 2019, when
Felix reported on a new
development in the saga:
over two years since
their original clipped
response, and with a
chunk of the affected
students having already
graduated, College have
pledged a cash bung of
£250,000 to put things
right.
Great news, if a little
belated – but there’s
a caveat. Rather than
being given freely to
affected students, in the
same way as the bursary
itself, this new money
will go towards funding
exclusive “specific
opportunities” – namely
UROPs, medical elec-
tives, and a bespoke
careers package from
the Careers service.
It’s hard to understand
the rationale behind this
decision. If College
were concerned about
the situation all along,
why not say so? Why
reflexively dismiss the
issue outright two years
ago, when there was still
time to do something
meaningful about it?
And why insist that the
money be worked for,
in the form of UROPs
or medical electives,
when the whole point of
a bursary is to remove
the burden of having to
perform extra work to
get by?
You’d be forgiven for
thinking that College
were hedging their bets
for two years, patiently
waiting for the last
of the 2015 cohort to
graduate before burying
the issue forever. A
pretty cynical tactic,
but it was working – the
issue had all but died in
the student body, and
soon enough everyone
who ever remembered it
would be long gone. But
from the jaws of victory,
College instead snatched
a mealy-mouthed mea
culpa.
I can think of a couple
of ways this may have
come about. The first
would be the emergence
of a split at the top of
College between those
who (rightly) think that
College’s responsibility
towards some of its
poorest students has
been neglected in this
instance, and those who
(also rightly) worry
about the PR impli-
cations of stirring the
hornet’s nest at this late
stage and would prefer
to continue playing
the waiting game.
Such a split would
explain some of the less
thought-through aspects
of the proposal; take, for
instance, the decision
to fund UROPs for
students who are mostly
about to graduate, many
of whom will soon be
without a place to live
in London and who
(by virtue of being
final-year students) are
unable even to apply for
summer accommodation
in halls at student prices.
What’s more, students
were informed of this op-
portunity in a joint email
from the Provost, the
Union President, and the
DPW, sent on the 18th of
February. The deadline
to submit the 1000-word
application form was
the 28th of February,
giving students ten
days to identify a novel
research topic, approach
potential supervisors,
assess whether they
would be able to find
accommodation over the
summer, and agree on
a provisional timeline
with their supervisor. I
suspect that I don’t have
to explain the implausi-
bility of this, especially
for the ever-frantic
final-year students.
What troubles me
more is the notion that
this is instead a last-
gasp attempt to control a
narrative. In the silence
following College’s
initial response in 2016,
those who were aware
of the situation grew
disenchanted with the
university’s reticence
to engage. Discontent
among staff has been a
tinderbox for a while;
last year’s pension
dispute provided the
necessary match for it to
ignite in unprecedented
industrial action. In
breaking their silence
on the lingering bursary
issue at this late stage,
College may have been
hoping to sweeten their
image in the minds of
graduating students
– students who will
shortly be filling in the
dreaded NSS; and if
they happen to soften
the resolve of the more
militant staff members
in the process, so much
the better for them.

first place? College will
correctly say that there
were probably various
legal impediments to
fixing the issue; that
the access agreement is
drafted years in advance;
that the Union agreed to
the changes in the first
place, so that students
themselves are partly to
blame. These arguments
are all fair and true; they
are also all undermined
by the fact that College
eventually managed to
find £250,000 down the
back of the sofa at the
eleventh hour.
Couldn’t College have
fixed this issue years
ago, then? Would it have
bankrupted the country
or, worse, the universi-
ty? I can’t answer these
questions because, for-
tunately for all involved
(not least myself), I
am not in charge of the
university finances.
Before finishing though,
I’d like to highlight a
few things that may help
you come to your own
conclusions.
In 2017, Imperial
had by far the highest
expenditure on senior
management pay in
the UK (as reported
in Felix 1688), with
each of the 20 “Key
Management Personnel”
earning, on average,
around £280,000 – for
a grand total of over
£5.6million. The next
highest was South-
ampton at £3.7million,
nearly £2million (or 4
times £500,000) less.
Imperial’s president,
Prof. Alice Gast, earned
£433,000 alone last
year, and she wasn’t
even the College’s
highest earner; this is
separate to the £300,000
she receives from
Chevron for her work as
one of its non-executive
directors, as recently
disclosed in an email to
all staff. £500,000 to fix
the low-income bursary,
then: a stretch too far?
To adapt a well-worn
cliché: it’s not about the
size of the budget, it’s
about how you use it.
