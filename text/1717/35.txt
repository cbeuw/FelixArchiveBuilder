Imperial make their mark at BUCS Indoors Athletics

etween the 15th
and 17th of
February, a team
of Imperial’s
finest athletes set off
for BUCS Indoors in
Sheffield.
This is the first big
event of the athletics
calendar and is attended
by the best university
athletes from across the
country. It provides a great
chance for athletes to gain
experience of competition
at the highest level and is
always a great event.
The competition
began on the Friday, with
Mahmoud Barrie leading
the way for ICXCAC in
the 60 metre sprints – he
delivered an excellent run
in the heats and qualified
for the semi-finals in a
time of 7.09 seconds! The
margins are so small over
such a short distance and
it was incredible watching
the sprinters pushing
themselves to the limit in
the finals later on that day.
Also representing
ICXCAC on Friday was
Kate Olding, who ran
really well in the 800m
heats and narrowly missed
out (by half a second!)
on qualification for the
semi-finals the following
day.
The rest of the team
was in action on Saturday,
with James Millett starting
the weekend strongly with
a great performance in the
1500m heats, finishing in
a time of 4:04.
What followed was an
action-packed day, with
an excellent set of results
for the team in both the
men’s and women’s
3000m heats – both Dani
Chattenton and Dan
Mulryan qualified for the
finals, while Stephanie
Hewitt smashed her PB by
a whole 11 seconds, fin-
ishing in a time of 10:42.
Dani also qualified
for the 1500m final,
while Alex Mundell ran
excellently in her 1500m
heat, leaving herself with
plenty to build on as the
season progresses.
Idan Gal-Shohet also
performed well in the high
jump, finishing with a best
jump of 6.21m.
After a successful day
on the track (and long
jump pit!), we piled into
Dani’s car and headed
back to our accommoda-
tion, where we spent the
evening cooking together
and catching up on the
highlights of the British
Indoor Champs in Bir-
mingham #onbrand.
For our finalists, it
was an early night and a
nervous wait, while the
rest of the team had the
chance to sample Shef-
field’s renowned nightlife.
Sunday: finals day.
Always guaranteed to be
a day packed with drama
and it didn’t disappoint!
The first big race of
the day for Imperial was
the 3000m women’s final,
which Dani Chattenton
entered as a strong fa-
vourite – she handled
the pressure like a pro,
outlasting the rest of the
field to take gold in a time
of 9:37!
An amazing achieve-
ment in itself, but could
she add to her medal haul
later that day in the 1500m
final?
We would soon find
out, but first we had Dan
Mulryan in the men’s
3000m final. It was a
tough ask given his recent
5k PB in Armagh only
a few days beforehand,
but Dan delivered an
excellent run, finishing in
a time of 8:31.
Following on from
Dan’s final, we all waited
in anticipation to see
whether Dani could pull
off the double – the 1500m
final was up next! What
followed was an exciting
final, where she put in a
very strong run to finish in
second place and bag her
second medal of the day!
It can’t be understated
what an achievement it is
to win two middle distance
medals in one day, so huge
congratulations to Dani.
As expected, finals day
did not disappoint – on
top of the amazing per-
formances for ICXCAC,
we had athletes literally
throwing themselves over
the line in their quest for
a medal and actual Olym-
pians competing in the
women’s high jump.
Being able to watch
Morgan Lake winning
gold at BUCS knowing
she represented our
country in Rio 2016 was
pretty spectacular and I’m
sure was quite inspiring
for the women competing
against her.
Overall, it was an
amazing weekend for the
team. So much to build on
for the rest of the season
and plenty of inspirational
performances to drive us
on.
This is only the be-
ginning of the athletics
season so there are sure to
be more exciting times to
come – up next is LUCA
outdoors at Parliament
Hill on 23rd March. This
competition is between
London universities and
provides a relaxed envi-
ronment for both beginner
and experienced athletes
from across the region – if
you fancy giving it a go,
join Imperial CollegeAth-
letics & Cross Country
(ICXCAC) today!
We have a full week of
varied sessions on offer
and with membership
you can also compete
for the university. We’d
love to have you out there
helping us battle against
King’s, UCL and LSE for
the LUCA Outdoors title.

Immortals emerge victorious from trip to Canterbury
and dodge relegation
Daniel Grumberg details how Imperial’s American Football team fared in their all-or-nothing
end of season tie against the Canterbury Chargers
SPORTS

T
he Immortals
just played their
last match of
the season, and
what a thriller it was! We
travelled to the Chargers’
home grounds in
Canterbury to battle it out.
The maths was simple:
win and stay on in Div 1 or
lose and potentially face
relegation. This meant
that Canterbury was now
backed up against a wall
and we were expecting a
tough game, unlike last
week.
The Chargers won the
coin toss and decided
to defer, so they kicked
off the ball to set up our
offence to start the game.
We got a few first downs
but ultimately had to
punt the ball away to
Canterbury. As in our last
game our defence, led by
Thomas “Cheerleader”
Smith, completely stifled
their offence and forced
a three-and-out that saw
them net negative yards.
The punt was quite short
as well, leaving us at their
45 yard line.
Unfortunately we
couldn’t muster anything,
but the special teams
excelled on the punt,
pinning them on their 1
yard line.
All the defensive
players were licking their
chops at this point and
sure enough the QB got
sacked for safety on an
outside lead. The score
was now 0-2 in favour
of the Immortals and the
Chargers had to punt us
the ball. We immedi-
ately capitalised with a
touchdown of our own
with Killian “Omelette”
Gmyrek catching the two-
point conversion, leaving
us with a sizeable lead at
0-10.
However, a broken
play on defence lead to a
“In fitting
fashion we
returned to
our famous
QB sneak, and
Ben redeemed
himself by
bringing it to
the house.”
Chargers touchdown with
a pass netting 65 yards
on 3rd and 10, due to a
couple of missed tackles.
Yet Canterbury failed
to get the ensuing two-
point conversion, putting
them 6-10 back.
The score remained
unchanged at the half,
despite the Chargers’
admirable red zone
defence culminating in
an interception in the end
zone, just as the clock was
winding down on the last
play of the half.
The story was quite dif-
ferent in the second half.
Initially, both teams
traded punts, until Ben
“Bootleg God” O’Brien
threw an unfortunate pick
six, that gave the Chargers
their first lead of the after-
noon at 14-10.
Twice after that the Im-
mortals managed to reach
the foot of the end zone,
but failed to capitalise
against a unyielding Can-
terbury defensive unit.
However, the second
of those attempts left the
Chargers at their 2 yard
line and of course, our
rookie Marcin “Sad Boie”
Olesinski managed to
tackle the running back
in the end zone to get us
a safety with only three-
shot at getting a touch-
down and winning the
game. Slowly but surely
we gained ground on
the Chargers thanks to
powerful running by Jonas
“He Won’t Go Down”
Eschenfelder, earning us
a first down inside the
Chargers 10 yard line.
Unfortunately we
couldn’t get anything
going on the first two
downs. Then a quick out
route left us just inside the
3 yard line with one final
attempt to reach the end
zone.
In fitting fashion we
returned to our famous
QB sneak, which we had
not used all game, and
Ben redeemed himself by
bringing it to the house.
With the score now
14-18 in our favour we
had just under a minute
left to play.
This left the Chargers
with only four attempts
to complete a deep ball
for a touchdown to win
the game. Thankfully our
coverage was on point and
the game ended on that
score line.
The last match of the
season also means addi-
tional traditions for the
Immortals, such as the
leavers tunnel where we
celebrate our soon-to-be
graduates who are now
becoming Mortals with a
final ovation.
The season might be
over, but we need to keep
building for next season.
If you are interested
in playing American
Football, we will be
having various flag
football events throughout
the rest of the year. This is
a perfect opportunity to
ease into the sport ahead
of next year, so if you
would like to join please
