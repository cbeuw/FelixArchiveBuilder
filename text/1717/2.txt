S t u d e n t S h a p e r s
offers opportunities
for students and
staff to break down
traditional power-
hierarchies and
work together in
educational design
and research
Alejandro Luy

S
taff and students
often assume
h i e r a r c h i c a l
positions in their
relationship with one
another – that of expert
and novice, teacher and
student or instructor and
apprentice. You’ve likely
already experienced
this during your time at
Imperial. In some ways
it is a necessary part of
education, but it doesn’t
always have to be, nor is it
always the most effective
model to achieve the best
outcome. StudentShapers,
which the Union and
College have worked
together to develop over
the past twelve months is
about cultivating authentic
staff-student partnership
in education, providing a
way for both UG and PG
students to get involved in
educational design or edu-
cational research projects.
In all StudentShapers
projects, staff and stu-
dents are encouraged to
break down those tradi-
tional power hierarchies
to work constructively
and creatively together.
Why? Because students
are experts too, just in
a different way to staff.
Students are experts in
being students, thinking
like students and know
exactly what it’s like to
work through challenging
content both individually
and with other students at
Imperial. By recognising
this and enabling staff and
students to work together
in authentic partnership -
the creativity, quality and
impact of project outputs
is made all the greater and
more wide-ranging.
Imperial is not alone
with the development
of StudentShapers – a
number of other universi-
ties have similar schemes.
However, what we have
here is a strong Academic
Rep Network which does
a great job at providing
the College with feedback
and ideas on how to
improve our educational
experience. Now, with
StudentShapers, the
College can not only listen
to feedback from students
but also collaborate with
students to work on that
feedback, continuing
to develop education at
Imperial.
involved in the project.
Not every student has the
opportunity to apply their
skills to shaping educa-
tion at Imperial – joining
a StudentShapers project
is a fantastic way to set
yourself apart and chal-
lenge yourself in a new
field. On top of this, all
StudentShapers projects
have an associated bursary
to support the engagement
of the student(s) involved
in the project.
Most StudentShapers
projects run over the
summer vacation, but
there are a few long
term projects that run for
longer periods of time.
If you are thinking about
what to do this summer,
take a look at one of the
many projects available
at https://www.imperial.
ac.uk/students/student-
shapers/how-to-get-in-
volved/current-projects/).
The projects vary in both
length and content – from
redesigning a module or
lab through to researching
how students interact with
digital learning. Check
out the featured projects
here to get an idea of what
to expect!

Happy International Women's Day
T
oday marks
International
Women’s day
and this week’s
cover story features a
discussion with Dr. Jess
Wade and Dr. Kelly
Ramirez about the issues
facing women in STEM.
It was really interesting
to catch up with them
and look out for another
interview in next week's
issue with Dr. Shini
Somara.
Election fever arrested
Imperial this week, with
the successful Leadership
Elections Live Debate
taking place in Metric on
Wednesday. I thoroughly
enjoyed the debate and
I want to massively
commend Felix Comment
Editor and social boi,
Charlie Titmuss, and my
guy DH and his ICTV
team, for their remarkably
smooth running of the
event. The debates were
a fantastic opportunity to
meet the candidates and I
encourage all students and
voters to watch online to
better make an informed
decision.
Naturally, I was most
investedintheFelixEditor
role, providing punditry
following the debate.
The biggest challenge
facing the next Editor is
recruitment. As I’ve said
many times, Felix would
be nothing without the
amazing Editorial team,
who volunteer their time
to make my job (and life)
easier. The role of Felix
Editor is unlike any other
sabbatical role in that the
Editordirectlyleadssucha
large team and, therefore,
a huge aspect of the posi-
tion is related to the social
side of club Felix and
keeping the team morale
high. Unfortunately for
my successor, quite a few
core members of the Felix
family are moving on to
pastures new. Drawing
on my favourite analogy
again, much like Sir Alex
Ferguson in 2013, I’m
leaving behind an ageing
squad and it will be up to
the next Editor to embark
on an aggressive recruit-
ing campaign to ensure
2
that their year in the role
resembles Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer’s magical tenure
and doesn’t resemble
the disastrous tenures of
David Moyes, Louis Van
Gaal and Jose Mourinho.
Speaking of Man
United, I’m going to use
the rest of this Editorial to
wax lyrical about our glo-
rious comeback aggregate
victory. I retract all of the
bullshit I wrote in my 15th
February Editorial fol-
lowing the first-leg defeat.
The honeymoon period
rolls on and it would be
a disgrace, a tragedy and
almost a case for national
emergency if Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer isn’t offered
the permanent manage-
rial role now. Anyone
around the Media Hub on
Wednesday night would
have heard my screaming
and raucous applause - I’ll
be (illegally) streaming
the rest of United’s
Champions League cam-
paign from the office and
operating an open door
policy so come down and
witness history! #GGMU
For those of you saying,
“but Andy, I thought you
don’t watch football?”...
don’t watch init. Mind the
business that pays you. I
was protecting my peace
during the dark days at
the start of the season and
now I’m enjoying wit-
nessing my team play with
passion, pride and purpose
again. After the disaster
which was submitting
the last 2 issues of Felix
(don’t even ask what time
I left the office last week),
I’m currently writing this
Editorial earlier than I’ve
ever written it and the
paper will be submitted
as early as it’s ever been.
My performance clearly
subconsciously mirrors
that of my team.
Section of the week
goes to the Comment
Section. Once again, I
have to commend the
immense work of Charlie,
who not only chaired
the Meet the Candidates
debate but also managed
to edit this week’s largest
section. Nice one mate!
Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk

Director, Imperial
StudentShapers
So what’s in it for you?
StudentShapers is a great
opportunity to engage
with your education in
a new way, where your
creativity, input and ideas
will be just as important
as those from anyone else
“The projects
vary in both
length and
content - from
redesigning
a module or
lab through
to researching
how students
interact
with digital
learning”
Featured project: Imperial Visualisations
Over the past few years a project in Physics has been
developing a digital visualisations library of science
and engineering concepts. These allow the learner to
interact with the concept, understand the underlying
mathematics and see how they apply to their particular
learning. The project is now expanding to other depart-
ments and will be implemented more widely in learning
of key concepts in subjects- As one recent student
partner on the project noted:
“As I had just finished first year myself, I felt I had a
good idea of the areas that could be supplemented by a
visualisation”
The project continues this year with further Student-
Shapers opportunities available.
Featured project: Imperial MedSTEP
Last summer staff in the Faculty of Medicine part-
nered with year 1 and 2 students to develop the ‘Self
Tests for Exam Preparation’ platform. By engaging
with students the design of the online portal particularly
suited the way students study and prepare for exams
and how questions could be designed, whilst the staff
partner ensured the content was clearly linked to the
curriculum and matched to module learning objectives.
One of the student partners within the team commented:
“The implementation of weekly group gathering
(round table) helped improve my capacity to receive
and give criticism in a professional manner, which
undoubtedly improved my teamwork skills”
The project continues this year with further Student-
Shapers opportunities available.
