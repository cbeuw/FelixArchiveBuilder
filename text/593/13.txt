A bit of a heavy week:j Comraemortion Day
(Rector and co. send everyone to sleep) followed
by all this Rag Mag nonsense. On top of all this
the typesetter broke J&rwn on Thursday after-
noon during the final stages of production
(hence a possible delay in publication). Sjtill,
there have been a few fun items.
Pulling a fast one
While on the subject of Montpelier Street,
it has come to my attention that the Senior
Warden, Dr Don Monro, has mysteriously ac-
quired three "wardens places" in the new Hall,
to allocate as he sees fit.
Warden's places have been the subject of
some controversy in the past at IC. It was over-
whelrningly agreed by ICU Council that welfare
places are needed for people who need a Hall
place due to illness or other disabilities. These
places exist and are allocated by the Welfare
Service.
Warden's places are not the same. These
are a 'perk of the job' (as if a rent-free pent-
house flat and the satisfaction aren't enough!)
and are allocated by the individual wardens as
they see fit. They often go to welfare cases,
but not always (indeed a staff member is now
living in Weeks Hall in another of Don Monro's
places). They are open to abuse and Council
agreed in 1980 that they should be phased
out and replaced by more welfare places.
Subsequently Student Residence Committee
(of which Don Monro was then Treasurer and
now Chairman) passed a motion which, while
not affecting the wardens under contract at that
time, ensured that any NEW contracts did not
include a right to warden's places. Don Monro
is trying to pull a fast one by hoping that nobody
will remember, but unfortunately for him I was
on that committee too.
Worst of all, of course, is that Dr Monro isn't
even warden of the Montpelier Street Hall.
He is warden of Weeks Hall only, but as Senior'
Warden is the person to whom the new Sub-
Warden of Montpelier Street is responsible!
This blatant attempt to disobey policy of
which he is perfectly well acquainted is a dis-
grace. I trust the Exec and the reps on Student
Residence Committee will INSIST that the places
are removed from his control immediately.
The sports editor
Due to lack of space this week, some sports.
articles have had to be cut/not included. I would
be grateful in future if articles were not longer
than 200 words, unless it is a special match (i.e.
cup or tournament). Hopefully this will enable
me to include everything submitted. I would also
appreciate it if articles were legible.

The above clipping is taken from the minutes
of an Executive Meeting held two weeks ago.
These meetings take place every week between
the three sabbatical officers (Nick Morton,
Barney McCabe and Marco Ledwold) and the
CCU Presidents (who are the Vice Presidents of
ICU).
The startling thing about this piece is that the
comments made are so incredibly stupid.
Surely the Executive realise that they, like
myself, were elected to act in the interest of the
students and not merely to appease the College
authorities . It seems that an article which
appeared in FELIX concerning how students
in the new Montpelier Street Hall were being
ripped off (because of the lack of decent faci-
lities) triggered this pathetic response from
our glorious leaders.
Did they ask for a rent rebate?
Did they complain to College?
Did they even bother to investigate
the validity of the claims in the article?
No.
Their response was the above five lines.
No action. No questions. They didn't even
mention their 'grievance' to me. Mouth a few
platitudes, write them down and give yourself
a pat on the back for having done something!
This seems to be their attitude.
I'd like to make my position clear. It is
quite obvious that if FELIX had not raised
this matter the whole affair would have gone by
unnoticed. It is my opinion that FELEK should
actively attempt to bring to light any matters
which affect student interests at this College
(and elsewhere) whether they are embarrassing
to the College authorities or not.
"Nick has received no formal complaints
himself,"-if the mountain will not come to
Mohammed it appears that hell sit on his arse
until it does! If Nick is so concerned, why
didn't he take a ten minute walk down to Mont-
pelier Street to check the facts for himself like I
did?
"This must not happen in the future because
this sort of pre-judgement can prejudice the
chances of a fair settlement,"—if by raising an
important issue (which the Exec were apparently
unaware of) we are "prejudging" then the Exec
obviously feel that FELIX cannot be used to
campaign for change. They seem to suggest
that we made up te whole story to be bloody-
minded!!
My advice to the Exec is. stop crawling
to the College and start trying to get concrete
results for the students you represent. A rent
rebate for Montpelier Street residents would
be a good start. Why haven't they done it?

AMIGOS!
Although he wished us all farewell with an
Adios Amigos at the end of last summer term,
Steve Marshall left only yesterday for South
America. We wish him a long and pleasant
journey. A list of possible diseases and poisonous
snakes was to appear, but we've started on the
obitury just in case. Seriously, good luck and
don't drink the water, eat the food or trust
the natives!
The Credits
My thanks to the following people without
whom I would be even more tired and red-eyed
by the end of the week: Martin S Taylor, Steve
Goulder, Shams, Moez, Martin Taylor,

A special thanks to the College Press and Pub-

Scaramouche
Scaramouche has asked me to clarify that the
eighth group in his puzzle reads "mn". The
characters which could be capital T's arc all
'L's; apart from these ambiguities there are no
misprints in the puzzle. EitrU. iSf1

Too many entries over the last two weeks,
so I've set something a little harder. But I don't
want to be too discouraging, so I have decided
to give the following hint which may contain
useful information: try rewriting it all normally.
G o o d luck everyone!
