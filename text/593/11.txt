Fourths
O n a damp pilch and with a new side the
home team settled down quickly and were
soon in control. Good work in midlield by
D o l a n o n the left a n d K i n d r e d a n d
M c M a h o n in more central positions resulted
in ihe forwards getting good service. M a n y
chances were wasted before a line cross from
the right by K i n d r e d was met at the near post
by Savage, who scored with a header.
Thirty or so corners won by the
Fourths and good efforts by McNicholas,
Burns and Savage failed to add to the score.
Such a one-sided match, R H C had a single
shot, should have resulted in a larger margin
of victory, but I C had to be content with
their solitary goal.
Team: Slater, Burns, Chown, Burden, Ataddr,
McMahon, Kindred, Dolan, McYicholax, Savage,
Heath.
Fifths
O n Wednesday at Harlington the Fifths, last
year's league and cup winners, opened their
league programme with an excellent win
over Royal Holloway Seconds.
The Fifths began in grand style and Keith
Chamberlain was unlucky to see his well-
taken shot rebound oil the Holloway bar.
The Fifths had several more efforts, before
Dave Stephenson gave them Ihe lead with a
well-taken header from a Bob Dhillon cross.
The score remained 1-0 until hall-time with
the IC defence of Nigel A u d i n , Satish K i e l ,
Dave Rogers and M a r k Haberlin dealing
capably w ith a very skilful Holloway forward
l i n e , a n d N e i l H a m p t o n i n g o a l dealt
brilliantly with anything that did get through
the defence.
Alter hall-time Holloway were lucky to
get a highly dubious equaliser, but far from
demoralising the Filths this was the signal lor
even greater ellbrt from them. N o w wave upon
wave of attacks were l a u n c h e d on the
Holloway goal as I C sought their rightful
lead. I n e v i t a b l y alter some m i r a c u l o u s
escapes around the Holloway goalmouth the
goal came: Dave Wadsworth opened up
Holloway on the right side and crossed to
Bob Dhillon who saw his first shot parried by
the keeper, but his lightning reflexes enabled
him to plant the rebound in the roof ol the
Holloway net. Further trouble was to befall
H o l l o w a y as N i c k G a s k i l l o p e n e d up
Holloway's defence and sent a rasping shot
into the top corner of the net.
Shortly alter this Holloway managed a
second goal. But IC immediately retook
command with Steve Coussens. once again
g h o s t i n g past his f u l l b a c k lo open up
Holloway's by now beleaguered defence.
T h e final whistle signalled yet another

X Country
The Cross Country C l u b flew the IC llag
bravely and courageously in the University
College Relay last Saturday fielding two
teams: one of superstars who finished seventh
and one ol stars finishing in eighteenth place.
The superstars were put in a very strong
third position alter the first leg by lasso
Astcriades who completed the tough but
short 1.8 mile course in Hmin 24sec . "The linal
leg runner Anthony Williams also had a line
run (8min 40sec) leaving the team knocking
on die door lor higher honours.
The stars gave a good overall performance
with an infectious team spirit adding colour
and excitement to the otherwise grey and wet
Saturday afternoon.
Highlight of the afternoon was the free
tea and had there been a cup for the greatest
consumption, wc would have won hands
down. The pig of ihe year award was made
jointly to Andy Britton and (Jill (who came
all the way from Newcastle, just lo hold the
coats—such is the attraction of C C C ) .

long to establish a stamp of authority over
their opponents. Instrumental in the control
of the game was Steve Thompson, a centre
playing lly-half, who showed a cool head in
all situations. Il was he. linking so well with
Jose Paxaio who initiated back moves which
created tries for O w e n Miles (1) and Dick
Downs (2). two wingers putting forward
creditable performances. 'The backs could
not have played so well without a fair share ol
set-ball from the forwards, who played with
spirit against a bigger, experienced pack.
F o r w a r d s w o r t h m e n t i o n i n g were W i l l
Aston, Phil Verity and Charles de Rohan.
Captain of the day was Steve Bell.
The fact that the IC team were defeated
10-15 does not reflect a bad result. 'The result
could have gone in IC's favour were il nol for
some poor tackling, the only bad lealure of
IO"s game.

Firsts
First reaction to reporting this could be "least
said, soonest mended."
'The Firsts lost to Kings 14-7 in a game
which displayed no will or commitment from
most of the IC team. The backs did not seem
able to h o l d the b a l l in any p a s s i n g
movements, which invariably broke down at
f l y - h a l l or centre, l e a v i n g two talented
wingers unused and frustrated, fhe game
could have been controlled much better were
it not for some poorly judged tactical kicking

IC's only try came from a scrum close to
the K i n g s l i n e , w h i c h was h o o k e d by
deRohan and picked up bv Johns, who drove
his liny frame through several tackles to
ground the ball lor a line try.
The forwards did however display some
line loose-play, winning some good second-
phase ball, which was poorly used. A lol
more practice and rethinking must be done
by IC. before thev can return some- good

Seconds
'The introductory match of the 1981 2 season
was against one of (he better College sides in
the area. H a v i n g said this, the Second X V
produced a very disjointed performance arid
were beaten by mediocre opposition.
The problems stemmed from the lack of
coordination that existed throughout the
team. This must not however be allowed to
overcome the fact that there were a number
ol very promising individual performances
and the defence held sound for long periods
ol pressure.
In fact. Kings only broke our defence from
two attacks started well inside their own ball'.
We fought back and scored from a rather
infrequent visit into their twenty-two. It was
good to sec the opportunity taken by the
forwards alter the backs had put us in a good
position.
The result was only a minor setback. The
H a m should work lo improve their overall
performance and aim for a successful season.

After t r a v e l l i n g by u n d e r g r o u n d to the
Kings' (';') ground the learn was quickly
changed and eager lo plav. From the start IC
ran the ball al Kings who had no defence
against the speed of play. The first try came
alter six minutes alter good team work by the
backs and was finally scored by A n d y Marks.
Mv les Thompson made a good break to leave

one ol his two tries oil the back o! a ruck and
