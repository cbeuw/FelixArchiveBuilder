Rector Soldiers On
In a speech given yesterday afternoon at the Commemoration
Day celebrations in the Albert Hall the Rector, Lord Flowers,
urged graduates to support Imperial College through the lean
vears ahead.
Using rhetoric more typical of an Army Major than a leading
academic Lord Flowers described the way in which the world
recession affected institutions such as our own and suggested tac-
tics for fighting the way through to more pleasant places.
At the very outset Lord Flowers reminded his listeners of
the present financial situation by intimating that Imperial College
may not be able to afford another Commemoration Ceremony.
He went on to describe the way in which universities had been
studied and criticised in the previous year, suggesting that in
the present age they are expected to produce definite results
in terms of employment of graduates in order to justify their
existences. Instead of this, he said, it is scholarship that should
be prized.
He believed that Imperial College should be committed to
the maintenance of standards in teaching and research even though
this will not be the easiest of paths. The Rector continued by
bemoaning the fact that we now have a lower intake of overseas
students than in previous years, saying that this would lower
the contribution that Imperial College makes to the world. Im-
perial College is. he said, encouraging the formation of ex-student
associations in many parts of the world and these, together with
the Old Student Associations of the three Constituent Colleges,
ought to give their loyalty and support to aid the College through
the present troubled times and inspire it to greater things.
Summing up he stated that we should take courage from
the splendid achievements of the past to fact the future undis-
mayed.
Rag Mag
controversy
Last Friday City and Guilds
Union took the unprecedented
step of refusing to sell this
year's I C U Rag Mag. They
objected to some of the
more contentious jokes con-
cerning the recent ' H ' Block
hunger strike, and the York-
shire Ripper case.
Copies of the publication
were brought to the I C U
Council meeting on Monday.
After Council had glanced
through the magazine there
was an extensive discussion.
The President was asked
if he had checked the proofs
before they were taken away
to the printers. He claimed
that he had taken the proofs
to look at but had subse-
quently delegated the job to
somebody else in the Union
Office. He accepted that had
he read the magazine he would
have asked for several jokes
to be removed. Thus he must
shoulder the blame, he said.
Council then decided that
until the matter was debated
at a U G M its sale should
be restricted to students of
Imperial College. In addition
it was recommended that Rag
Committee alter its constitu-
tion to include a statutory
requirement for the proofs
to be approved by members
of the executive before print-
ing.
The magazine is now on
sale from the Union Office
for a donation of 30p or
more to Rag.
