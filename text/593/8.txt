H.G. Wells Soc
Incidents of seeing objects or events, which for
reasons of space or time or other causes, not
discernable through the ordinary sense of
vision, have occurred since time immemorial.
F o l k t a l e s , m y t h s a n d i n d e e d r e l i g i o u s
documents including the Bible are full of such
events.
It hasn't been until this century that this
phenomenon has been investigated scientifi-
cally. The first studies were undertaken by the
society for psychical research, founded in
1882.
Last Monday the current president of the
society, Prof Arthur Ellison, addressed the
H . G . Wells Society o n clairvoyance. Prof
Ellison began by giving evidence supporting
the validity of clairvoyance, which was so good
that the only doubts anyone could have would
be doubts on his honesty. Cases of mediums
achieving an accuracy of 96% in answer to
questions from the relatives of deceased
persons were cited.
Prof Ellison finished off b y saying that
although examining other peoples psychic
experiences would give a great deal of insight
into the workings of the human mind it would
continue to raise more questions than give
answers. The next step for people researching
into the field would be for themselves to
u n d e r g o p s y c h i c e x p e r i e n c e s t h r o u g h
hallucinogenic drugs, like L S D or, for long
term effects, through mind training through
Raja Yoga.
Next week we will be having Dr Sinclair
Goodlad delivering a lecture entitled 'Humour,
a serious business?' with excerpts from Tony
Hancock's 'The Blood Donor' and T o m and
Jerry. This will be on Monday, October 26 in
E E 408 at 7:30pm. See you there.

Hurrah, yippee and so on. Last Saturday's rag
stunt saw forty-seven people outside Harrods
with tinsel o n their cans for the Xmas Rag
Stunt. Everybody enjoyed themselves, what
with a betinselled Jezebel and some out-of-
tune carol singing and between us we collected
a r o u n d £350 putting our total just below
£1,000. T o p collector (again) was T e r r y
Everitt, C h e m 3, who has become the first
person to qualify under the incentive scheme by
collecting over £50.
All the clues for the Monopoly Rag on
Saturday are now prepared so it's up to you to
turn up. R C S people can meet in the R C S U
Office between 9:30 and about 10:15am where
we hope to have coffee and toast for you, at
approx 15p each. Then it's all off to I C U to get
the clues. I recommend purchasing your Red
B u s R o v e r before c o m i n g to the office if
possible and an A - Z as well. Don't forget to
group into teams of 3, 4 or 5 with a mascot.
Steve asks me to tell you that the next
Broadsheet has b e e n p o s t p o n e d u n t i l

the R C S U Careers Brains Trust on Monday,
November 9 at 6:30pm featuring a hot buffet,
in the Main Dining Hall, Sherfield. Entry is £1.

The Mines/IF Disco, with the John Watts

Thanks to everyone who helped set up, run
the bar and clear up afterwards.
For everyone who didn't attend the U G M
last Tuesday: there is a M O N O P O L Y R A G

of rally on foot and/or using public transport.
You're given a set of clues, one corresponding
to a place on the Monopoly board and are
a s k e d to solve t h e m , while y o u are also
collecting money, hopefully! There is a prize
for the team with most points (award for
money collected, clues answered, and the
team mascot!). Teams (three to five people)
will be leaving Beit Q u a d from 10:30am
o n w a r d . It's a great way to see L o n d o n !
Anyone wanting more info turn up in the
Union Office lunchtime today.
