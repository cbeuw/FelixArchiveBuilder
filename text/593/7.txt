Canoe
Last weekend saw the club's first trip away.
This time to Crbyde Bay in North Devon,
canoe surfing. Despite having to use a crewbus
instead of our usual, we eventually managed to
find spaces for both people and luggage, and
set off at about 6:00pm. After a longish stop for
food and refreshment we all arrived safely, if a
little tired at approximately 1:00am. We awoke
on Saturday morning to find it pouring down
with rain and that the waves (ripples is
probably more accurate) were smaller than one
usually sees on the Serpentine. After a hearty
breakfast we had a quick tour around the local
surf shops and then went to the pub for lunch.
O n Sunday the surf was a little better but
not at all inspiring, especially for those who
had been on the summer tour to Brittany.
O n a slightly brighter note, the club is having
three further trips this term.
October 31 to November 1 Mike Jones
m e m o r i a l w e e k e n d on the River Dee at
Llangollen, N Wales. The Dee is one of the
best white-water rivers in Britain and this is
one of the few occasions that we are able to
p a d d l e t h i s r i v e r . T h i s t r i p is h i g h l y
r e c o m m e n d e d for the more e x p e r i e n c e d
paddlers.
November 29 River Dart, Devon. The Dart
is also a very interesting river with good
stretches for both novice and experienced
paddlers.
December 12 and 13 surfing trip to Bude.
Hopefully we will have better luck with the surf
this time.
For more information about the above trips
or just canoeing in general don't hesitate to
come and see us.

Chess
T h e final results from the 1980/1 season
became known over the summer. A s u m m a r y of
the results is as follows. In the Middlesex
Premier Division the first team finished equal
third or points and beat W o o d Green in the
process. (We were the only team in the whole
country to do so.) The second team finished
second in the second division and have gained
promotion. We were winners and runners-up
in the London University Pugh C u p and in the
Intercollegiate League our three teams finished
third, first, and third respectively. The College
Championship was a three-way tie between D.
B. Lund (Maths 1), M . M c C a l l (Physics 1) and
R.A. Coles (Maths 3).
O u r first event of this season was the
Freshers' Lightning tournament on Monday,
October 12. Forty-two people entered and a
nine round swiss competition was played.
Most of the strongest players had surprise
defeats in the early rounds and with a good win
in the last round Jeremy Fraser-Mitchell from
Physics won with 772 /9. Other leading results
were 2-4: M . G . B e n s o n , D . B . L u n d , R . L .
Smith; 7/9 5: R. Hasan 6>/2 /9.

Yacht
IC Yacht Club started the new season last
w e e k e n d w h e n s i x t e e n m e m b e r s a n d a
c l a p p e d out m i n i b u s t r a v e l l e d d o w n to
Lymington harbour on the Solent. We had two
boats for the weekend: an O O D 34 and a Red
Admiral 37, both of which are comfortable
yachts and exciting to sail.
Saturday dawned grey and damp, but with
plenty of wind. After a substantial breakfst we
headed up the Solent towards Cowes. The
strong winds made sailing exciting, at least for
those not busy throwing their breakfast back
over the side. After lunch at the Island Sailing
Club in Cowes, we sailed back across the
Solent to spend the night in the Hamble River,
where we celebrated the Captain's birthday in
suitable fashion at the Jolly Sailor.
Light winds on Sunday enabled the boats to
sail back to L y m i n g t o n with s p i n n a k e r s
flying—or in the case of one meglomaniac
skipper, with a series of coloured sails being
h a u l e d up a n d d o w n the mast in q u i c k
succession by a rapidly tiring crew.
If you want to sail on a voyage of discovery,
find those little known south coast hostelries
and experience latex custard, come to a yacht
club meeting on Thursdays at 12:30pm in the
Botany C o m m o n Room.
Graffitti
Graffitti is alive and kicking, and waiting for
commissions, but please give us at least two to
three weeks . notice if you want us to print
something. U n f o r t u n a t e l y we cannot do
posters with two days notice since members
design and print them in their own time and, as
you well know, that tends to be limited once
the term gets into full swing.
Graffitti meets on Wednesdays at 12:30pm
in the w o r k s h o p , west s t a i r c a s e , U n i o n
Building. See you there!

despite arctic conditions.

post to be filled, the election will take place at a
