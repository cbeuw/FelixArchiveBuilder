EXEC VIEWS
What fun, Council met last night. For the benefit of first years our by-laws
state that "the management of the Union shall be vested in a Council ".
Council consists of a variety of hacks and is chaired by yours truly. It
often discusses financial matters and day to day running of the Union.
Occasionally Council discusses policy and it has its own policybook to
complement Union policy.
Examples of Council policy are "the Deputy President should conduct
himself in an orderly fashion" and "sexual intercourse is permissable in
Union premises but only when discreet and unavoidable". Obviously
these examples are somewhat facetious and Council often discusses very
serious matters.
Last night the most controversial item discussed was the Rag Mag. It
was finally decided that the Rag Mag should be put on sale only to IC
students for the time being. The Rag Mag contains jokes which many
may find offensive.'
Council last night was not particularly well attended. It is rumoured
that this was due to the absence of tea to help sustain members through
the meeting. Those of you who were not present can be assured there
will be tea next time ! would appreciate it if the absentees would see me
as soon as possible
Those members who were present and promised to help out next
week with our little problem, please turn upin the Union Office for
instructions, etc.
A n d finally on Council, there are a number of vacant posts especially
on P W P . P W P is the Permanent Working Party and they are concerned
with solving internal problems. Last year, for example, they worked on
refectories, libraries and Union places on College committees. There are
four vacancies, wo of these being reserved for first years. They will be
elected at the next U G M and Marco will be putting up papers soon. More
form him o n that one soon.
Don't miss your chance for fame, glory and tea at Council meetings.
