Ents Gig
an opinion
This useless past can never last, you patrons
really should not stand for this kind of
e m b a r r a s s i n g d e f i c i e n c y — h o w dare these
organizers presume that any set of bands can
be so interesting as to play in such primitive
conditions. G o d only knows the pop concert
has been a pointless institution until a few
years ago, but a lot of clubs are at least trying to
change—some video here, some cocktails
there. A decent dislocated disco would not
have been too much, the garbage they played
b e t w e e n (and d u r i n g ) sets was s i m p l y
unbearable. The IC grate haul is a perfect hole.
There was no bar. N o bar!! The most basic
commodity was not readily available, the fact is
this is (dis)gracefully unacceptable. How can
all these silly people out looking for delight
accept these 'gigs' as self-contained events?
Let me explain: the performers are never an
event (not that anything is of course), and
these bands should never be thought of as the
main attraction—they should not be thought
of as an attraction at all, they are an amusing
background entertainment (entertainment?!).
These 'gigs' are for dancing, drinking, talking,
