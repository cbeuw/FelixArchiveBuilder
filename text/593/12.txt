Marks. Lively forwards work alter a quick
throw in gave J o n Cottom his second try.
Paul Bateson drove over the line to bring the
number of tries to eight. Throughout the
game the forwards drove exceptionally well
over the dead ball leaving it clearly for scrum
half J o h n Goddard.

Firsts
IC First X I continued on their victorious way
on Saturday with a resounding win over-
Bedford. The game as a "football spectacle"
was quite unimpressive, I C obviously being
in a generous mood and not scoring any ol a
multitude of chances in the second half.
Fortunately, one or two incidents do stand
out in the memory. M a r t i n "when I kick 'em,
I don't hit ' e m " C u r r a n did a commendable
impression of a pirouetting ballerina whilst
trying, unsuccessfully, to execute a volleyed
clearance! Steve "when I lay in front of'em,
they don't score" W a r d chose an opportune
moment to pray to Mecca and thus save the
s h o r t - s i g h t e d W i l l i a m s ' b l u s h e s ! A n d y
"anyone want to buy a pair of second-hand
hoots" Page decided his feet were overheating
and cooled them down by hall-ripping the
soles oil! But, the burning question left from
this match was: W h y does Dave Dean always
fall over when he shoots? Answers on a

Thirds
IC Thirds started their league season at
Harlington on Saturday with a 7-2 victory
against Bedford.
Despite Bedford arriving somewhat late,
a n d S i m o n L i s t e r passing the time by
p r a c t i s i n g his s h o o t i n g against the light
fittings. IC's early confidence was quickly
realised with M c P h a i l scoring two early
goals. Just after this however, despite trying
to keep a "low profile" (his words, not mine),
referee Russ Gilbert (ex I C . now working),
decided to blow his whistle. While the IC
players studied their' rule books to see if this
was allowed, Bedford scored (and the whistle
blew again!!).
The second half saw a more determined
a t t i t u d e from I C a n d some moments ol
inspired play led to two goals from R i m m e r
a n d one lor P h i l i a s t i d e s . R i m m e r then
proceeded to outjump a defence considerably
bigger than his own garden gnome-sized
IVame. to score the goal of the match, and
collect his hat-trick.
Bedford scored a consolation goal before
Hendy kicked the goalkeeper with some
considerable force, so that he dropped the
hall, and allowed M c P h a i l to nip in for his
hat-trick and IC's seventh goal.
Overall therefore a pleasing performance
for the lust match of the season, one that
must hold good prospects for the rest ol the
year. W h i c h is more than can be said about
the chances of seeing Rimmers hat-trick jug.

Sevenths
Following their 7-3 midweek success against
L S E Fifths, the Sevenths opened the official
season with a win over St. Georges Hospital
Seconds.
IC scored First through Julian Norley, but
St. Georges soon equalised when P. Gaston
scofed, due to poor I C marking at a corner.
However. .Norley again gave IC the lead
following another cornel'.
D u r i n g the lirst half St. Georges had coped
with the persistent IC pressure by passing
back to their goalkeeper but this proved their
undoing in the second half and allowed
Norley to complete his hat-trick.
T h e r e t h e n f o l l o w e d a l m o s t t o t a l
domination by St. Georges but they were
restricted to a single A . R o b i n s o n goal,
particularly due to a line save by the cat-like
R o b B i r d , I C ' s p l a y e r - m a n a g e r a n d
temporary goalkeeper and excellent m i d -
field play from Dave Tinkler.
The game concluded with Colin Baker
p u n i s h i n g a n o t h e r St. Georges defensive
error.

Firsts
W h e n the team had recovered horn the shock
of seeing Scan Bell arrive on time (with
guest), the Firsts departed for Harlington.
D u r i n g a game played in steady drizzle, I C
struggled valiantly to compete with a team
which was particularly well organised and
skilful.
After a prostrate goalkeeper had conceded
an o p e n - p l a y goal in the first h a l l , the
M a r t l e t t s began the second p e r i o d very
strongly, trying hard lo press home their
advantage. This they did with a shot from the
edge of the area which went in past an
upright keeper.
Towards the end of the game, alter' a
r e v i v a l f r o m I m p e r i a l , the o p p o s i t i o n
notched up their third from a penalty Hick,
alter a recumbent goalkeeper had lain on the
ball.
Nevertheless, the team's performance gave
cause for optimism for the remainder ol the
season.

Seconds
Despite being forced to play on a miserable
S a t u r d a y m o r n i n g , the seconds r e a c h e d
Sunbury with eleven fully conscious players
and umpire M a r t i n Shaw. The team started
oil full ol confidence, the defence ol Pete
Cunningham, M i k e Pitketulcy, Chris Bird
a n d A n d y W h i t e h e a d d e a l i n g very w e l l
indeed with a strong Sunbury attack. Pete
Hughes then decided to show the Sunbury
supporters on the touchline what college
hockey is all about. They were certainly left
with the right impression as his twenty yard
a e r i a l pass l a n d e d i n a l a r g e b u s h i n
somebody's back garden. Unfortunately we
conceded a goal just before half-time when
we were looking the better side.
The deficit was quickly w iped out alter the
break with Gordon Bateson scoring alter a
line run. The Sunbury defence was then put
u n d e r t r e m e n d o u s pressure w i t h A n d y
Garms and T i m M i t c h e l l combining well
d o w n the c e n t r e of the p i t c h . A s we
c o n t i n u e d to t h r o w m e n f o r w a r d the
inevitable happened: Sunbury scored on the
break despite the efforts of Roll Slatter. who
had earlier made a superb save to keep us in
the game.
With time running out we were awarded a
penalty alter a finely struck corner from
Hughes. Unfortunately his resulting penalty
Hick failed to gather pace oil the turf and
caused the goalkeeper to dive full length in
order to save the ball before it came to a
complete standstill! Despite several more
penetrating attacks down the right wing, we
conceded a third goal near the end of the
game. This was a line team performance,
despite the rather unflattering scoreline and
our lirst win cannot be far away.

Thirds
The team maintained its unbeaten record (an
amazing feat for so late in the season) after a
well fought h a c k i n g session o n the O l d
Creightonian potato patch. Chris Jones (20)
careered around the D clearing the ball and
hostile players alike, while the wallowings of
the rest of the learn achieved the desired
result (of staying upright for more of the
game than the opposition managed to). After
an invigorating shower everyone joined Chris
in the bar lor a well-earned pint.
Thanks arc due to the T i m A l l a n taxi
service, T i m Mitchell lor the time-keeping
and to everyone else for turning up.
