Report on page 3.
Due to the breakdown of the F E L I X photo-
typesetter this issue was completed on other
equipment and this prevented us from correcting
pages 4 and 11. The front page, back page and
page 3 may also seem a little unusual. My sincere
apologies—we will return normal service as soon
as possible!
