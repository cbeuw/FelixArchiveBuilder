Dear Marge,
It's not fair.
That naughty Bill person has been
doing nasty things behind my back
again. D u r i n g my week as F I D O
editor, he actually gave the printer
a day off to go to the dentist;
disgraceful! He also deliberately ran
out of items, and actually had the
indecency to give me the phone
numbers of stockists to re-order. Of
course I did nothing of the sort.
Instead, I worked around the
lacking items, allowing me to have
a good gripe in the process.
Nigel 'Seamus' Baker
Marge says: Don't worry about it.
That Bill is a nasty character. W h y
d o n ' t y o u write a factually
inaccurate article slagging h i m off,
and put it on a page about what you
did when you swapped jobs. O h ,
sorry, I see that you have!
Dear Marge,
I am having great problems with
my work, I can't concentrate and I
think that I am a failure. I have taken
a long time with my course, and
now that the end is in sight, I think
that I may not pass.
! Anon., RSM.
Marge says: You have brought it on
yourself, Sid l u w y ; you simply
spent too much time with yourself.
Also, in future, l u w y , please restrict
your personal problems to the
opinion page, as you have done in
the past.
Dear Marge,
I have this terrible fear that my
head is about to explode. I always
have a splitting headache, and I
wonder if you could tell me what...

Sent by next of kin.
Marge says: I think, luv, that at least
you should have the common
decency to finish any letter that you
write to me. It should also be free
of gelatinous tissue and be posted
by yourself, not by your parents; it
would serve you right if your head
did explode l u w y .
Dear Marge,
Recently I met three hags on the
moors of Knightsbridge, who told
me some very wierd things, one of
which has now come true
Macbeth McTavish. (Thane of Glamis,
Cawdor)
Marge says: Who writes this stuff.
Seems rather reminisant of a
whodunnit I once read. By the way,
you may soon die. Sorry to break
the news to you like this but, l u w y ,
you should have read the book.
Dear Marge,
People keep writing to me with all
their p r o b l e m s . They expect
answers, solutions, to every barrier
in their way to a happy life, but
why, oh w h y l u w y , do they turn to
me.
Marge Maudlin.
Marge says: Well, people write to
you because you are an agony aunt;
what did you expect?
Marge says: Yes I suppose I
expected an answer like that from
a smartarse like me, but why have
I got such a silly name?
M a r g e says: Because M a r g e
Wilkinson might offend first year
mathematicians .IToken F E L I X 'in' Joke)
M a r g e says:
schizophrenic?
C o u l d I be
Marge says: N o , it can't be.
Following this exchange, the men
in white coats dragged Marge out of
the office. Next week, 'Dear Marge'
will be written in crayon, as she is
not allowed any sharp objects.
