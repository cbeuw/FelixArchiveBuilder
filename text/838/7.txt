Doctor
Faustus
The Lost Theatre, 450 Fulham Road
The flickering candles suggest a
church. The points of light pick out
eerie objects in the heavy darkness.
Faustus, the faded scholar,
languishes in his study
contemplating a wisdom more
powerful than his learned readings
have yielded: The Art of Magic. This
production's darkly menacing set
seems an ideal place in which to
conjure up the devil.
As with church attendances,
though, demand for the devil seems
to be falling off. When I saw this
show the cast was more numerous
than the audience. Perhaps with
something as familiar as Marlowe's
classic people fear finding a virtual
recital of the piece at a fringe venue.
Happily this production cannot be
described as such.
Stephen Lee's flamboyant Faustus
inhabits the landscape of devils and
spirits with conviction. He therefore
manages to dispel the seeming
absurdity of such a world and draws
us into his spiral towards
damnation. The strength of his
performance holds the play together
like the hub of a wheel. Around that
hub the rest of the cast sustain a
dizzying whirl while Stephen
Requera's solemn Mephistopholes
haunts the wings of the stage, like
the G r i m Reaper i n holy orders.
With a bravely low-key peformance
he captures the watchman look,
overseeing the inevitable fall of
Faustus to death and damnation.
The two lead roles dovetail well and
make for a strong combination.
The frequent clowning scenes are
thought to be later additions and not
w r i t t e n b y M a r l o w e himself.
However they now form part of the
currently accepted version.
At times these provide a little light
relief but at others are a definite
distraction. The company get*
through most of the gags okay if
without any great invention.
What sense one can make of the
religious ideas that make this almost
a medieval mystery play is difficult
to know. After all, Faustus' crimes
consist of having a craving to learn
a little cosmology, a keen interest in
Pope. Hardly matters for which, in
any sense, one would expect to be
damned. But theappeal of this play
lies chiefly in its striking imagery.
The Faustus myth has inspired
many for hundreds of years and will
continue to do so as long as strong
productions such as this get
support. I strongly recommend that
you see it this evening or tomorrow
night which is the end of its very
short one week run.

The Man
with the
Flower in his
Mouth
Cafe Theatre Club
T am the son of Chaos', wrote Luigi
Pirandello, and besides the pun on
the isle of his birth, Kaos, it is easy
to see why. His Six Characters in
Search ofan Author is the archetypical
play of what has been called 'meta
theatre' which openly proclaims
itself as illusion with the aim of
exposing the daily illusion that we
refer to as life. A s Shakespeare had
it 'AH the world's a stage', and if so
then what better place than a small
room above a pub for a man to meet
you and tell you something of his
life.
So it may happen that whilst
waiting one lunchtime in the Bear
and Staff with your drink you may
choose to take the part of a stranger
waiting for a train and listen to the
story of 'The M a n with the Flower
in His Mouth', a short Pirandello
piece. For less than half an hour you
will be waylayed by a man with a
cynical slant on life who berates an
empty chair about the sad fiasco of
their lives. The man had reason
enough to be bitter it seemed but I
didn't like the chap. I left hoping
that I'd be waylayed a little more
often on the streets, in pubs or bars,
but next time by someone with a
better tale to tell.

The Creative
Monochrome
Image
David Chamberlain
This is an extremely useful and
readable book based o n
Chamberlain's own experiences as
a photographer. It certainly is not
aimed at snap shooters and as its
title implies it is solely concerned
with black and white photography
and creating 'images'. Anyone who
has seen Chamberlain's work will
understand what is meant by image.
There are no landscapes or portraits
here.
The first half of the book concerns
techniques a n d considers such
subjects as c o m p o s i t i o n a n d
lighting. The majority of this section
is given over to darkroom technique
giving ideas o n film developer
combinations and printing.
The second half of the book is a
folio of Chamberlain's o w n work.
The subjects contained here are as
diverse as the resulting images. The
greatest boon of this section is the
copious amount of information
attached to each picture. This
includes comments f r o m
! Chamberlain on how he originally
jenvisaged the picture and how he
achieved the result. The technical
information includes camera and
film used, lighting techniques, and
printing and finishing.
This book will be very useful to
anyone w h o is i n t e n d i n g to
specialise i n black a n d white
photography and is prepared to
spend many hours achieving the
result. I would not recommend it to
anyone w h o is only casually
interested in photography or is not
prepared to do their own darkroom
work.
