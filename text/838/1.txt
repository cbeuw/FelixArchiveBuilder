Silwood Open Day
Exams to be marked
The Association of University
Teachers (AUT) have called off their
examination ban after agreeing to
the Committee of Vice Chancellors
and Principals (CVCP) latest pay
offer, it was announced yesterday.
Following a ballot last week, A U T
members voted to accept the
C V C P ' s offer of 6 per cent rise plus
a £150 lump sum (increasing to £285
for those universities who could
afford it) by 11,549 to 9,534 votes.
Imperial College A U T
representative, Susan Parry, said
that she was very disapointed with
the result.
Tt was not unexpected because
our members were totally
demoralised. I don't think the
C V C P can claim any sort of victory,'
she said.
The A U T will now be pressing the
C V C P to honour the findings of
their 24th report which recommends
further increases in the pay review
scheduled for April 1991.
The Chancelor of the University
of London, Lord Flowers, has called
for the Colleges of the University of
London to interpret the A U T / C V C P
agreement ' i n the most generous
manor.'
Although the University will be
offering a uniform lump sum for all
of its Colleges, as part of the pay
deal, the move has been widely
interpreted as an indication that the
University of L o n d o n will be
forthcoming with the full figure of
£285.
Over four hundred students and academics attended Silwood Park
Open Day on Wednesday and Thursday last week. This garden was
one of the many exhibits on show.
Welfare survey shock; IC is very boring
The results of the Union's welfare
survey were made public this week,
and provided some interesting
reading, particularly in the area of
alcoholic habits and attitudes to
sexuality.
Despite the myths surrounding
alcohol consumption at Imperial,
44% of all those replying to the
survey claimed that they drank soft
drinks more regularly than alcohol,
with postgraduates and overseas
students stretching this value to
almost 6 0 % . This left
undergraduates the highest overall
consumers of alcohol.
The majority of students claim
they drink approximately 16 units
per week, and of those that refrain
from drinking, 32% gave health,
22% religion, and 47% 'don't like'
as their reason.
The results suggest that the
college bars are less popular than
pubs; 49% of respondents drink in
their local bars and 33% i n other
pubs and wine bars compared with
43% who use Southside and 31%
the union Bar as their local.
The Survey showed a high
tolerance towards homosexuality.
Eighteen per cent of responses
f o u n d male homosexuality
acceptable, 2 1 % found female
homosexuality acceptable, with only
10% and 7% respectively feeling that
such sexuality s h o u l d be
discriminated against. Ninetyfive
percent of the replies were from
heterosexuals of which 60% of the
males and 42% of females claimed
to have h a d ' n o sex'. O f the
remainder 74% of the females and
67% of the males claimed the A I D S
crisis has not affected their sexual
behaviour but when questioned
about their attitudes to A I D S
sufferers, 18% felt it was 'their o w n
fault' a n d a further 5 1 % felt
sympathetic but unwilling to help.
Questions o n contraception
revealed that 8% of couples don't
use any, and of the remainder, 60%
use condoms and 50% rely on the
pill.
Fifty three percent of the males
and 74% of the females who are
sexually active have only one
regular partner. Eleven percent of
males claimed to have regular one-
night stands compared with less
than 4%of females.
There were a strange variety of
responses to the 'drugs' section of
the questionnaire. 50% of students
smoke tobacco and 12.5% cocaine
on at least 'a fair number of
occasions', with u p to 4 % taking
other drugs i n c l u d i n g speed,
cocaine and L S D on the same basis.
In contrast, 29% claimed that they
were unable to obtain tobacco on a
regular basis.
The general feeling appears to be
anti-drugs judging by the 59% of
respondents w h o feel that it is
necessary to clamp down o n all
forms of drug abuse.
Financial questions revealed that
30% of Home Students and 16% of
Overseas Students finance
themselves with loans compared
with 33% of Home Students.
Undergraduates, o n the whole, '•
spend less than postgraduates and
oversea's students, whose extra
expenditure is mainlyiih the area of
food a n d travel. This group,
however, spend less on alcohol,
although post-graduates admit to
s p e n d i n g twice as m u c h o n
cigarettes as either undergraduates
or overseas students. There is little
differentiation with respect to year
or nationality i n expenditure o n
accommodation, entertainment or
clothing.
Forty two percent of students live
either in college halls and houses,
or head tenancies a n d 59% of
students pay between £31 and £50
per week for their accommodation,
17% between £51 and £80 and less
than 4% exceed this.
The vast majority of students live
within a 10 mile radius of college,
less than 5% live between 11 and 20
miles away, and under 3 % live
further out.
The f i n a l section of t h e
questionnaire revealed that 65% of
students come f r o m a state
education, 3 3 % f r o m private
schools, and a surprising number of
'don't knows'.
In response to the introduction of
student loans, 16% claimed to be
against them, 16% i n favour and
28% impartial.
Nigel Baker was pleased with the
success of the survey. He found the
sexuality replies surprising, in that
they ' s h o w e d I C to be less
homophobic' then he had expected.
