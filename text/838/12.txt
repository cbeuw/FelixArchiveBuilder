More careers cutbacks
Residence
cockup
Refurbishment programmes in Halls
and Houses may have to be
postponed next year following
overspending this year by the.
Managing Survey of Residences, Mr
Peter Hallworth.
The extent of the overspending is
still being investigated by the
Colleges Finance section and it is not
yet clear how muchwork will have
to be postponed, but it is likely that
the planned redecoration of
Southside will not go ahead next
year.
The extent of the overspending
was revealed at the Warden's Sub-
Committee of the Students.
Residence Committee last week
when Mr Hallworth presented
figures showing that he had
overspent by £140,000 above the
income from rents (revenue) but
had underspent by £140,000 on the
income available from loans
(capital).
'I've been over-ambitious on
upgrading improvements and we
have had a particularly heavy work
load this year' said Mr Hallworth.
Senior Assistant Finance Officer,
Malcomb Aldridge told FELIX that
the Residence Office had
'worryingly overspent' and added
'we are only able to maintain the
standard of maintainance that
students are prepared to pay for.'
Mr Aldridge challenged the
figures presented by Mr Hallworth
claiming that Mr Hallworth's
definition of 'capital' and 'revenue'
reserves did not correspond to the
conventions used by the Finance
Office
Accountants are currently sifting
through M r Hallworths 2735
transactions and allocating them to
the appropriate account and until
this process has been completed the
extent of the overspending will not
be known.
Southside
protest
A group of students from the RCS
are currently organising a petition
against the price of soft drinks sold'
in Southside Bar. They are
particularly angry at the 46p cost of
a pint of cordial, which they claim
involves a charge of 36p for less than
a pint of water, lOp being the
standard charge for a measure of
cordial in any other drink.
The College has decided to cut the
funding of the Careers Service by a
further £3,000 in a move described
by the Rector, Eric Ash as part of a
new policy to generate external
funding for the careers services. The
cutback has been made on top of a
£10,000 cut to the careers service
earlier in the year which coincided
with the allocation of an extra
£10,000 to the 'Hub' Office, run by
the Rector's wife, Clare Ash.
Professor Ash told FELIX that
companies would would be pleased
to contribute for the use they make
Dave Osbourne and Murray
Williamson were returned as joint
editors of the City and Guilds
handbook,.Spanner, at the Guilds
General Committee meeting on
Tuesday. Steve Farrant and Tanya
Maul were returned as joint Rag
Treasurers, and Joe Fearnley was
elected to the position of Shop
Manager.

awarded to Ralph Greenwell,
Murray Williamson and Dave
Plans by the Department of
Education and Science (DES) to
introduce differential course fees by
1992 have provoked an angry
response from Student Unions.
Under the scheme, Universities
and other Institutions of Higher
Education will receive a greater
proportion of their funding through
course fees which are due to rise
from £600 to £1600 next year.
Academic subjects are due to be
divided into four catagories, each
charged at a different rate;
•Band A (£1600)
Humanities
Business Studies
Languages
Nursing
Social Sciences
•Band B (£2000)

of the careers service at Imperial.
'There is a terrific shortage of
talent out there' he said.
Union Deputy President, Chas
Brereton, told FELIX that he was
concerned that the College had
made the cutbacks without
adequately consulting the careers
service. He went on to say that
because Imperial was acting
unilaterally, employers would be
discouraged from recruiting from
Imperial, making life much more
difficult for IC graduates.

Course fees will continue to be paid
for by Local Education Authorities
from funds made available by the
Treasury
Opponents of the move argue that
it will lead to declining teaching
standards because it encourages
Universities to take on as many
students as possible without any
provision for increasing teaching
facilities.
Concern has also been expressed
that the proposals would lead to the
closure of those small specialised
Colleges which lack the resources to
take on sufficient numbers of
students.
Acting Union President, Bill
Goodwin told FELIX last week that
he was concerned that part time
students and those relying on
discretionary grants would be badly
affected.
'Although the Government is not
cutting back the amount of money
allocated to LEAs for these students,
there is no guarantee that the LEAs
will choose to use this money to
offset the increased course fees,' he
said.
Nescafe banned
in UGM motion
A motion calling for the banning of
Nestle's products from Union and
College outlets was passed at
Tuesday's Union General meeting.
The motion was raised by Cyril
Wong of Third World First in protest
to the company's alledged violation
of international codes on the
marketing of breast-milk substitutes.
The motion mandates the
President of the Union to write to
Refectory Manager, Rob Northey
requesting that he discontinues use
of Nestle products in the refectories
and instructs the Union to pay for
a poster and leaflet campaign to
encourage students to boycot the
company's products.
A second motion calling for IC
Union to support Chinese students
in their campaign for greater
democracy in China was also
passed. The motion, proposed by
Andy Player also of Third World
First, was passed without
opposition.
A controversial motion calling for
the Union to find a way of
introducing external bank accounts
for clubs and societies was passed
after a good deal of debate.
Speaking in favour of the motion,
Social Clubs Committee chairman,
Tom Yates said that Imperial College
Union was almost the only students
union not to allow its clubs external
bank accounts.
'External bank accounts will allow
clubs to get on with what they are
supposed to do without getting
wrapped up in red tape' he said.
The motion was opposed by
Union President, Nigel Baker, who
tried to amend the motion so that
the Union would be mandated to
'investigate the possibility' of
external bank accounts rather than
to find a way of implementing them.
Speaking in opposition to the
amendment, Mr Yates pointed out
that Council had already disbanded
a working party which had been set
up to investigate the possibility of
external bank accounts, and that it
was because of Council's opposition
to the idea that he had been forced
to raise the issue at a U G M .
Speaking in favour of the
amendment. Deputy Presiden:
Chas Brereton said 'If we alloy
external bank accounts to proliferat!
it will be chaos in the Union an<
College will laugh at us.'
The amendment was taken to the
vote and defeated. After furthei
debate about the administrative
problems of ecternal accounts, the
motion was taken to the vote and
passed.
