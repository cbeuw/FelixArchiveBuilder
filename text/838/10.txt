The University of London Athletics
C h a m p i o n s h i p s were held at
Tooting Bee track on March 8 and
11. This was earlier than usual, to
ease the selection of the U L BUSF
team. O u r traditional venue,
Motspur Park, would have been
unsuitable for athletics in very wet
conditions, so i n the light of the
unpredictable March weather, the
synthetic track at Tooting was
chosen.
Imperial College has recently
done very w e l l i n these
championships, winning i n 1986
(Men and Combined) and 1987
(Men), except for last year which:
was a bit of a write-off. However,
undeterred by last year's debacle we
decided to try to recapture the title.
Due to some unfortunate a n d
persistent injuries, o u r middle
distance squad was weaker than
normal. The turn out overall was
not very good, especially as far as
the ladies were concerned, but those
who turned out really gave their
best.
Fish, our star high jumper, also
proved to be an able 110m hurdler
(6th), discus thrower (4th), shot
putter (3rd) and hammer thrower
(3rd) as well as comfortably winning
the high jump with a jump of 1.85m
and with three very good tries on
1.90m. D o we have a budding
decathlete here?
A n athlete w h o has already
dabbled with the decathlon is A n d y
Rogers, our team organiser. H e
proved to be an invaluable point
scorer yet again. He came 4th in the
100m, 2nd in the 200m, 3rd in the
Pole Vault, 4th in the High Jump,
4th in the Triple Jump, 1st in the
Hammer and 2nd in the Shot Put.
He also anchored both the 4x100m
and the 4x400m relay teams.
Dan McQueen and John Rowland
made it to the finals of the 400m and
800m respectively. Peter Smith tried
an alternative to hurdling when he
decided to go under rather than
over the last hurdle, however the
officials were not impressed and
subsequently disqualified him. Dave
Knight (400m Hurdles) and Dil(l)
(3000m) ran well, but the opposition
was to strong o n the day. Stuart
Cameron gave his all in the 2000m
walk, only to just miss out on the
points.
John Rowland, who had run the
800m heat i n his trainers, was
considerably more serious for the
final as he had acquired a brand new
pair of spikes, and it really paid off.
The pace was fast, Justin Chaston of
Goldsmiths' showing his class, but
John gritted his teeth and hung on.
The 1500m final, a few hours later,
gave Chaton his fourth gold medal,
having also won the 3000m, as he
romped home unchallenged. Alex
Gaskell made a break for the silver
with a lap to go, was unfortunately
caught but still finished a creditable
fourth and Stefan Ledin captured
one point for his sixth place. The
fight for team honours was still
ASIANSOC
Culture
Well, it's here at last! A n d , for those
who haven't heard about it yet, it's
called Asian Soc—a fresh Society
with fresh aspirations. Its aim, quite
s i m p l y , are to promote a n d
encourage the culture of Asia and its
inhabitants among an increasing
multi-cultural crowd of students at
Imperial.
It's a Society for everyone! For
A s i a n s — b y e n d e a v o u r i n g to
increase the integration of all their
different cultures and faiths and
attracting members from a diverse
range of backgrounds a n d
communities. But also, for non-
Asians—by providing them a new
and exciting opportunity to learn
and appreciate various aspects of
the Asian culture.
It aims to be different and to bring
to you only events which have extra
style and class! With sparkling
ideas, demanding challenges a n a
assurance of the 'top activities i n
town', it intends to positively
change the face of the College in a
way never conceived or attempted
before.
So, how can you get involved?
Begin b y getting your friends
interested—tell them the wonderful
news. The Society is offering
membership at a mere fee of £1.50,
covering not only this term but the
rest of the next academic year. This
guarantees no disappointments and
entitles you to super deductions at
all of the Society's events. What
more could you ask for?
For anyone out there with plenty
of bright ideas and suggestions for
forthcoming events—why not come
forward? If y o u have anything
you'd like to propose or wish to
make further enquiries about
membership, then contact the
Founding President, Bhartendu
Vyas (Computing 1) as soon as
possible and keep a close eye on the
Asian Soc noticeboard along the
walkway near the bookshop.
between U C L , a rapidly emerging
team, and your heroes, IC. It came
down to the final relays, the 4x100m
and 4x400m.
The 4x400m squad (P Smith, D
McQueen, J Rowland, A Rogers) ran
a very detremined race a n d
annihilated the other teams to w i n
in an excellent time of 47.0s. IC was
then up against a formidable U C L
team i n the 4x400m relay but we
only needed to finish fouth or
higher to w i n the title. Again a very
gutsy performance by our boys (D
McQueen, J Rowland, A Gaskell, A
Rogers) brought us home in third
place to clinch the t i t l e — U L
Champions (Men) 1989—by four
points. The will to w i n was nicely
displayed by the fact that we were
only three points ahead on the first
day but then managed not only to
hold the distance but also extend
our lead.
What about the ladies then? There
were only two women from IC
competing this year. Alison Turner
put in some solid performances in
coming 4th in the 100m, 5th in the
200m and 2nd in the 400m. Helen
Macintosh, just back to running
after an ankle injury, fought well in
the 1500m and 3000m finals, but just
missed out on the points. The turn
out from IC was hot very good but
all athletes competing did well and
fought hard. The team spirit was
something else, people were
cheered on by their team mates and
some good-natured piss-taking of
poor Stuart, our hip-wriggling
walker, took place. I would like to
express my gratitude to A n d y for
taking the time to put the team
together and also thank the athletes
for turning up.
A few of the IC athletes were
selected to represent L o n d o n
University at BUSF i n Derby, o n
April 30 and May 1. Fish was sleeted
for the High Jump where he did
really well, finishing 5th, with a
quantum leap of 1.95m. Fish also
tried his luck with the shot but
found his fellow competitors too
strong. Alison Turner ran i n the
400m, where she was eliminated in
one of the high standard heats. She
also ran in the 4x100m team which
finished 5th. Alex Gaskell and
Stefan Ledin went to Derby as
reserves, and both got to run. Alex
ran in a very hot 5000m heat and
fought courageously. IC Captain
Stefan was left floundering in the
water j u m p i n the 3000m
steeplechase. There must have been
something wrong i n the seeding
procedure, as the idea is to make
sure that the strongest runners do
not burst themselves to get to the
final. Why Stefan was drawn to run
int he fastest heat is beyond
c o m p r e h e n s i o n . A d m i t t e d l y ,
however, the only way he could
have made the final this year was if
there had been only one runner in
the heat.
If there are any budding athletes
out there, do not hesitate to join in
the fun. We are training down at
Battersea Park o n Wednesday (at
14.00) and Sundays (at 11.00). Y o u
can also reach us through the
Athletic Club pigeonholes. Training
in Hyde Park takes place just about
every day at about 12.30, meet in the
Union gym or by the noticeboard
next to the main staircase i n the
