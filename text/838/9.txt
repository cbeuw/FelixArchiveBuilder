Bohemia
Guide to Bohemia
North of Paddington, South of the
•wastes of Kilburn lies a magic land.
Wide tree lined avenues of 1930's
mansion flats abound. Stretching
from the opulence of St. John's
Wood, across the waters and cafes
of Little Venice, up to the fading
grandeur of Maida Vale, the area
reeks of decadent wealth. This is
London's Bohemia.
The place to begin the mystic
journey is Maida Vale Underground
(Bakerloo line). Note the inimicable
'30s architechture - a hint of things
to come. T u r n i n g left d o w n
Randolph Avenue until we reach a
large green roundabout. Opposite is
the Warrington Hotel (Free House)
- our first stop.
The Warrington is a Grade 2 listed
building, a temple to Art Deco. The
fresco above the lounge bar is an
example of the worst taste our
ancestors have ever created.
Crowded at weekends, the pub
tends to be lively most nights. A n
excellent pint of Fuller's ESB can be
obtained, also served are Pride,
Abbot, Brakspears Best and Ruddles
County.
W e continue S o u t h d o w n
Randolph Avenue, reaching Clifton
Road. Here we turn left and about
100 yards on the right is the Robert
Browning (Samuel Smith's). Also
listed, this simple p u b has
fascinating stained glass in the main
bar. Also worth a visit is the quiet
Quiz

lounge upstairs. The Museum of Ale
is highly recommended. Tuesday is
quiz night with a barrel of beer for
the winning team.
We turn right out of the Robert
Browning, continue to the end of
the road, then turn right into Maida
Vale. After 100 yards we turn left
into Aberdeen Place. U p the bank
and on the left is Crocker's (Free
House).
Crocker's was built by a M r .
Crocker who, anticipating the new
London terminus of the Great
Western Railway, designed and
built a grandiose pub/music hall for
travellers; expecting a great profit.
Sadly, the G W R went to
Paddington and 'Crocker's Folly'
was left stranded. Since then St.
John's Wood has grown around the
Victorian relic and the pub is fairly
busy.
It is a listed building and the
ceilings are astounding. The room •
to the left of the entrance is a
working theatre with a free 'music
hall' caberet on Wednesday nights.
Beers are an odd mix of small
northern breweries and there is
usually something worth sampling.
Walking back to Maida Vale and
straight across we pass south of the
canal along Maida Avenue then
pass round the south of the Little
Venice basin to the Bridge House on
Delamere Terrace (Charringtons).

To finish we stagger round the

haven't got a clue, have you? Try
and read a book which has words
of more than one syllable (some of
them even have some quite exciting
rude bits). There is more to life than
drinking lager, for example try
drinking wine. Both of these may
improve your chances with the
opposite sex.
