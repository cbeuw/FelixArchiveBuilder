Humour may be the cornerstone of
civilisation, it is certainly a great
characteristic of the British people.
Maleable enough to serve the cause
of the bigot as well as that of the
saint, it finds its most noble
expression in the defiant resilience
of human values in the face of a
sober evil. Historically it fulfils this
potential in the Blitz spirit of second
world war London, and in theatrical
expression it informs this revival of
a little known Noel Coward play
which first opened in 1947.
The atmosphere that Coward
found in Paris at the end of the war,
whilst playing cabarets to the
troops, was a mixture of the shame
of the defeated and the bitterness
against the more ignomious.
collaborators. This fuelled his
speculation as to the fate of the
British spirit had the battle of Britain
been lost, Operation Sealion
(Hitler's invasion plan) succeeded
and this country been annexed as
the emerald in the crown of the
thousand year Reich.
The retrospective prognosis was
of course good, and in order to
prove it Coward assembled a cast of
characters from cockneys to the
upper crust to play out the drama
of this daydream in the setting of a
Knightsbridge pub.

The Drowned
and the
Saved
by Primo Levi
The S.S. concentration camp guards
boasted that the enormity of their
crime would never be appreciated
whatever the outcome of the war.
They thought that they could
destroy the physical evidence and
that any survivors 'would not be
believed'. The Nazis were wrong.
Our problem has not been one of
credulity—the appalling condition of
the survivors and the piles of
unburied corpses speak for
themselves—but of understanding
the nature of those who committed
the crimes. This book, just
published in paperback, is Levi's
attempt to examine this problem,
which he acknowledges can only be
partially successful.
Primo Levi was an Italian Jew, a
chemist by profession, without
religious beliefs, who was
transported to Auschwitz in 1944.
He escaped death in the gas
chambers and on an almost equally
fatal forced march to Germany by a
series of almost impossible chances.
Having recounted the facts of his
experiences elsewhere, and after
forty years of reflection, Levi at last
.felt able to offer an analysis of what
he and many millions of others
underwent. With his intelligence
and powers of observation,
sharpened by his scientific training,
remaining with him even in
Auschwitz, Levi describes the
disintegration as human beings of
the guards, through their self-
deception, and the stripping of the
Jews themselves down to a common
humanity.
It is part of Levi's purpose to
apportion blame, and although,
unlike the Christian Dostoyevsky,
he is aware that small act of
goodness cannot outweigh gross
evils, he is concerned to do so with
humility and understanding.
All Primo Levi's work is valuable,
but this book, at a time when we
face the stirring of threats from other
murderous orthodoxies is perhaps
the most valuable of all.

will play as Chamberlain's dream
fades to a bloody nightmare is a
speculation polite enough not to
overtax one's brain.
A n d so with a typically twee little
ditty, from a chorus of four, entitled
'Don't lets be beastly t o the
Germans' we lurch ironically on into
the rather more serious business of
defeat and occupation. A t first, as
one would expect, this trifling blip
in the status quo is subsumed in a
dignified way with a slight change
in drinking habits (Gordon's gin
being swappedfora rather rough
rum) and a quip at the ready to spar
with the humourless Huns.
It is not long though before the
awestruck captors tire of such
games. The spell is broken a n d
reality forces itself upon them with
ruthless insistence. A s half hinted
rumour emerges as fact, and N a z i
war crimes are witnessed i n a
tortured human form, it is clear that
a stiff upper lip is no substitute for
action and resistance against the evil
regime.
The thirty strong cast of this play
keep u p a formidable pace and a
gripping tension throughout both
acts and the stage is never still nor
overcluttered. In fact it is only as
they gather for a final sentimental
song about certain southerly cliffs
that the full size of the company
becomes apparent.
With its unashamed patriotism
and its unerring faith in the British
character this play faces accusations
of smugness self-indulgence and
oversimplification. These accusa-
tions are true. But, given the
circumstances of the war the view
that some 'British' traits may tend
towards virtue are emotionally hard
to resist. G o d forbid that

morals be based on anything other
