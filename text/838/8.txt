Bill & Nigel's Job Swap Report
BILL
1 started off mv week as Union
I'resident with the premise that I
would probablv not be able to
achieve very much within the space
of only a few days. The job is
nebulous a n d less deadline
dependent than FELIX and it really
comes down to the President to
decide how he or she is going to
spend the day.
The ultimate frustration of being
Union President is that major
changes in the running of the Union
do take a long time; they have to go
through the committee machinary
before they can be implemented. In
many ways, even a whole year is
not sufficient. This is in sharp
contrast to the job of FELIX Editor
in which the end goal of each week
is to produce 4000 copies of a
publication.
Although I started my week
without really knowing what to
expect, 1 managed to settle into the
job reasonably quickly. A lot of the
President's time is taken up with
committees. During my week, I
experienced the Wardens' S u b
Committee a n d the Students'
Welfare Committee, both of which
todk u p large portions of the day,
but they were nevertheless quite
enlightening and certainly not as
tedious as I had been led to believe.
1 was quite pleasantly surprised to
discover that 1 had met many of the
Committee members already whilst
pursuing news stories for FELIX.
I was disappointed by the Students'

hit. The proposals deserve an article,
of their own but suffice to Say that,
in conjunction with the external
affairs officer, 1 wrote to the DES
highlighting the dangers of the
proposals and making alternative
recommendations. The letter is
available in the Union Office for
anyone interested.
One of the greatest differences
between FELIX and the Union office
is the strong organisational backup
of permanent staff which the Union
Office possesses. The permanent
staff are undoubtedly worth their
weight i n gold. H a v i n g a
receptionist, for instance, means
that the President does not have to
deal with everyone who walks into
the office and having a permanent
member of staff to type letters saves
a good deal of time. In the same
-way, the Union Manager, the
JFinance Officer and the Welfare
^Adviser are on hand to provide
tvvide ranging support,
t* Overall, I thouroughly enjoyed
I my week as Union President but in
the space of a week it was not
possible to gain more than a flavour
of the job and I'm sure Nigel will
have found the same with FELIX;
performing the job on a week to
week basis is a very different matter.
NIGEL
When I took over the Editor's role
of FELIX for the week my main aim
was to get a reasonable newspaper
out by a realistic hour on the
Thursday. In order to do this I saw
myself acting more in a managerial,
than editorial role. This meant
ensuring the efficient production as
opposed to supervising and editing
every word written. Having spoken
to a number of the FELIX staff it was
clear that the rewriting of their
stories and articles has been a
constant bone of contention and so
I felt that, with m y own limited
experience, I had to avoid this at all
costs.
The content of my FELIX, or H D O
as I chose to call it, also represented
quite a shift from what Bill has been
producing this year and also from
what many past FELIX Editors have
p r o d u c e d . B y the time the
permanent staff salaries, the cost of
the sabbatical editor a n d the
running costs and budget of paper
are added together it can be seen
that the production of FELIX, the

The second, often neglected, side
of the job is the running of the Print
Unit. This responsibility was really
taken away from me by virtue of
there being no external print jobs
(except Bill's personal production)
and the Litho being broken on the
Monday. What non-FELIX printing
that was done was for the Clubs and
Union with equal emphasis on both.
I must thank Bill for the work he
did ensuring my week in the Print
Unit was as painful as possible.

All in all I enjoyed my week in the
Print Unit but I don't think that
printing or publishing will feature
very prominently in my future
plans.
