o c k e / MARTINS
Last Saturday the 1st and 3rd X I s travelled to Har-
row by a team coach. However, this coach was delayed
for forty minutes whilst all those who had brought cars
to go in found somewhere to park them. F r o m the
start trouble was evident, since the strongmen of the
committee, R o n Pa'mer and M i c k Downs, had to per-
suade the driver that Harrow means Stanmore. N o t
to be outdone got well and truly lost in Harrow —
or was it Stanmore?
Things then became more confused as the two
teams had to be dropped off at two different grounds.
Well the 3rd X I were taken to the door, but the 1st X I
— even with the help of an A - Z — had to climb over
a railway bridge and trundle through muddy fields
before they caught sight of the mud-heap that became
the pitch.
Mention here should be made of John Astley who
thought it would be better to go by scooter armed
with an A - Z . After a n even greater tour of Harrow
than the coach, John finally found the 3rd X I ground,
but then decided it was too late to try and find the
let X I ; so he went home!
The match itself — shortened due to our late arrival
— was very average. Harrow, even with a n extra
man, d i d not live up to expectations as members of
the 1st division of the Middlesex League. T h e first half
ended with a blank score-sheet, mainly due to the
home side's erratic shooting.
The second half had some memorable scenes: M i c k
Downs clearing off the goal-line with everybody else
beat; M i c k Downs — again in defence — wildly swip-
ing, but missing the ball and knobbling T i m Hansen's
shins. H e even swore after the match he wasn't pissed
the night before.
The final score was 1 — 1 Colin Dyer scoring for I C
after a fluff by the keeper. T h e equaliser by Harrow
followed a free hit from just outside the circle.
Team: S. Boulton; R. Cameron, R. Palmer; B.
Evans, T. Hanson, G . Popple; A . Tatchell, M . Downs,
J. Gahir, C . Dyer.
R u m o u r has it that the 2nd X I lost 3—0 and the 3rd
X I drew 1—1, John Andrews being the scorer; but
rumour of the result of last Wednesday's 1st X I match
against Brunei still has to seep through to darkest
Clapham. Doesn't anybody know where the Math's
letter racks are?
After last week's report M i c k Downs demanded an
apology for his mention but I move that he should
drink a pint of Heineken since he arranged a Sunday
morning match which was called off by the opposition
— a fact 1 did not learn until I arrived at Harlington.

There is insufficient

Therefore no permits will

There will be a good se-

The College Cellars are

The ever active Guilds

wilds of Hertfordshire on
Friday evening (2nd Feb-
ruary). Eleven enthusiastic
crews set out from the
start near Windsor, and
ten managed to find the
finish.
The infamous Perry
Newton had to be rescued
at one point as his car
took to the water like a

but wouldn't come out
again. M a r t Clemow man-
aged to find more m u d
than anyone else, but man-
aged to finish.
The rally was w o n by
Simon Briscoe (again!)
with John C o x o n a n d
Pete Wilkins second and
third, and the majority of
crews seemed to have en-
joyed the event.

STUDENT WORLD
B I R M I N G H A M U N I V E R S I T Y has
now decided to come out on Rent Strike,
despite a decision of last term not to do
so. T h e result, however, is disappoint-
ing: only one of the seven halls has come
out in support. The Communications
Secretary of the University U n i o n told
a Felix reporter i n early January that
each hall's J C R had individually voted
against strike action; it would seem that
they are sticking to that decision. " R e d -
brick", their newspaper, was the only
other i n the country besides " F e l i x " to
run a special Rent Strike issue at the
start of term.
LEEDS UNIVERSITY halls have
been plagued by hordes of Assurance
salesmen — one hall had no less than
seven visits last Sunday alone. "Leeds
Student" names the firms as the Gradu-
ate Assurance Bureau, Lynn Assurance
Services and the University Assurance
Service, which are not known to operate
in Imperial College.
N O T T I N G H A M halls seem to be los-
ing a lot of glasses — so one of them
has set up a deposit system for half and
pint glasses. T h e deposit is lOp, refund-
able on return of the glass . . . but it
looks as if the hall could lose out, as
there is nothing to stop people collecting
glasses from elsewhere and claiming the
deposit!
SUSSEX UNIVERSITY staff and
students are complaining that the inter-
disciplinary teaching system is being dis-
carded. The scheme involves teaching
science to arts people and arts to science
people. One of the problems is that there
are more arts than science students.
L A N C A S T E R students N i n a Thomas
and Geoffrey Foote, banned from attend-
ing political meetings o n campus for
disrupting a right-wing meeting, have
withdrawn their appeals to the Vice-
Chancellor, Charles Carter.

A p r i l voted last week to abolish all
awards for student newspapers, maga-

will thus be no Paper of the Year o r

tors from around the country, has set up
sub-committees to investigate the setting
up of a National Student Press Service
