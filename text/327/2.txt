Letters
Partisan ?
Sir,
Letters in FELIX attacking
cleaners as being "lazy" and
"unnecessary" must be
wholeheartedly condemned
as being on the same level
as those calling students
"long-haired layabouts, who
have never done a day's
work in their lives". An im-
portant question is raised
here for, as we are entering
this enormous campaign for
grant increases, should let-
ters and articles attacking
cleaners or any other section
of workers in the college be
published? In the Grants
Campaign we are going to
need the support of every
group of workers or profes-
sional people we can get, to
ensure the defeat and re-
moval from office of this gov-
ernment. When you go in for
a battle, for that is what the
Grants Campaign is, one does
not want to alienate one's
friends and support one's
enemies. The whole of soci-
ety is being polarised; today
you must either be on one
side or the other. On the
side of students, hospital
workers, pensioners and civil
servants fighting to stop liv-
ing standards being cut—or
on the side of big business,
property speculators and the
Tories, fighting to maintain
their rate of profit.
A successful Grants Cam-
paign must be seen as a part
of the entire class struggle.
Plans must be made and for-
ces mobilised to demonstrate
that we are not prepared to
lie down and be trampled
over: we must fight back.
"Felix" should be part of
this fight for it is a student
newspaper. It should be a
paper that discusses all the
issues involved in the de-
fence of students' rights —
not one that sets out to be
non-partisan.
Yours, etc.,
PETE GILLETT.
(Note—this letter has
been adapted slightly to en-
sure grammatical correctness
and continuity).
E d i t o r ' s N o t e : It would
be sheer hypocrisy to sup-
press free speech in a student
newspaper, which is exactly
what Mr. Gillett is suggest-
ing! Felix will continue to
attempt to show all sides of
the argument wherever pos-
sible.
More UGMs
Comrade Editor,
I am continually shocked,
surprised, disappointed and
bored to tears by reading
such inchoate bourgeois poli-
tical sub-thinking as por-
trayed in the letter from
Charles Ftussden.
The habit of rambling on
about democracy in student
affairs is repugnant to all
members of the Union with
a trace of dialectics in their
souls.
As I understand the sys-
tem, in order to ensure that
union meetings are represent-
ative, a random numeral,
chosen between the greatest
and least number of students
likely to attend a Union
meeting, is called a quorum
and shouted out at inoppor-
tune moments by Bill (I hate
myself for doing this, but
. , ..) Gerrard.
I find it very difficult to
believe that we really need
less than one Union meeting
every week—be they general
or Extraordinary general—to
decide on the best tactics
in the continual struggle
against Capitalism, but for-
tunately one section of the
revolutionary vanguard of the
student proletariat (i.e., the
Exec.) is not afraid of ignor-
ing the irrelevant whinings
of the average "moderate"
apolitical twits and take
votes on contentious mo-
tions in order to defeat Tory
attacks.
In closing there is one
question about democracy
to which I would be grateful
for an answer from Mr.
Russden: Why should anyone
who isn't a political activist
be allowed a vote at Union
meetings?
Yours fraternally,
ALASDHAIR ULYANOV

Left-wing
thinking
Sir,
At last the final solution
has been found!
It is well-known that there
currently exists a global glut
of unemployed graduates;
the taxpayer must pay these
people not only whilst they
study, but also when they
find their expensive educa-
tion unwanted. The result is
a total waste of both public
money and these young
people's time.
Now if the state were to
stop giving grants to students
altogether, fewer would
attend universities, of course.
Thus, the surplus-graduate
problem would be solved
most neatly, as would the
student-nuisance problem,
since most would be too busy
earning and studying to play
at revolution. Most import-
ant of all, more than £f00
million of public money
would be saved each year,
and could be used for such
worthy causes as the aboli-
tion of supertax and death
duties.
Yours faithfully,
J. PELLY-FRY.
Volunteers!
Sir,
The Wandsworth Housing
Aid Centre is a voluntary
organisation which provides
housing aid and advice to
families and single people.
It is run by a committee of
members and is staffed dur-
ing the day by one (soon to
be two) full-time paid Co-
ordinator. We receive most
of our financial support from
Shelter and our services are
free.
The main work of the
volunteer members is to give
preliminary interviews to
people who make appoint-
ments by 'phoning or calling
in during the day. The inter-
views take place between
7.00 and 9.00 Monday to
Friday. We also have a
meeting once a month. We
desperately need more mem-
ber/interviewers who can
spare about two evenings
per month. No-one is expect-
ed to interview alone until
they have sat in with an
experienced interviewer for
a while. Once the interviewer
has taken all the details and
given any advice he can, the
case is taken up by the full-
time Coordinator.
I should be very grateful
if you could mention our
need for more volunteers in
your newspaper so that any
of your students (or staff)
who live in the Wandsworth
area and who are interested
will get in touch with us. The
people to get in touch with
for more information, date of
next meeting, etc. are—Dave
Ferris (Coordinator) Wands-
worth Housing Aid Centre

Thank you.

Case
History
Sir,
As you have asked for
letters concerning the grants
campaign, I thought I would
write and tell you what my
particular story is, with re-
gards to grants.
1. Early in 72, I applied as
normal for an LEA grant, and
was awarded £360 pa for 3
years, £120 pa being de-
ducted because of parental
income.
2. At Christmas, I got
married to a girl who had a
4 months old baby. She did
not have a job then, arTd does
not have one now.
3. Twice, on 'phoning my
LEA, I was told that my grant
could not be changed for the
whole of the 3 years, eitTier
by virtue of my married
status or because of the de-
pendent child.
4. We moved into a base-
ment flat in Hammersmith,
and are paying £5 plus per
week rent, where my wife
does domestic cleaning for
the landlady.
5. My situation can now
be summarised. For an in-
come of £360 a year, or £12
a week during term time,
with nothing during vacation,
I have to support myself, my
wife, my child including all
food, clothing, travel expen-
ses and books.
If Mr. Norman St. John
Stevas can think of how we
are to live, I hope he will
please tell me.
BILL WOOD, EEI.
(Thank you Felix).
Asms
Sir,
A token stoppage by some
hundreds of members of the
Imperial College Branch of
ASTMS took place last 'Tues-
day afternoon. There is a
Branch Meeting this Tues-
day, February 6th, and it is
likely that the same event
will occur. Thereafter it is
likely to become more seri-
ous and I have no doubt that
we will come to the President
of IC Union to invoke the
agreement made between
the College based Unions
(including I.C. Union) during
the presidency of John Mc-
Cullough.
The situation is complex,
but simply it is as folows.
In 1969 ASTMS was chal-
lenged to co-operate on an
equal basis with the govern-
mental Manpower Service
Unit and the Universities to
provide the correct salaries
and correct gradings for
University Technical Staff.
This challenge we accepted
and have been heavily in-
volved in detailed and con-
structive work. As time has
progressed national and local
agreements have evolved to
which ASTMS and the Uni-
versities have put their sig-
natures, binding in honour
only. Elsewhere up and down
the country the administra-
tion of Universities have
broken such agreements
made. It now appears to be
the turn of Imperial College
administration.
Having demolished every
single argument that the Col-
lege administration have
brought forward, we find that
the College is breaking two
agreements because it is
their decision to do so.
There are other matters
that also concern us. A
group of dedicated and pro-
vocative non-trade unionists,
who demand as a right every
concession that their trade
union colleagues win from
the College locally and from
the Universities nationally,
have been given the most
favoured treatment. This, in-
cluding a special meeting
with the Rector. It may not
be widely known but it is
College policy to deny the
ASTMS any representational
rights as a body on any Col-
lege Committee except one.
WE sit on that one because
we threatened many years
ago some drastic action. It
may not also be widely
known that the present Rec-
tor has ruled that he will not
see representatives of
ASTMS and IC Union jointly
on any matter.
With the conscious
breaking of agreements by
the College and in this kind
of atmosphere, who can
blame our members for dem-
onstrating their disgust.
Yours sincerely,
H. FAIRBROTHER,
Secretary.
Thank you,
Son/a/
Sir,
I refer to the letter from
Sonia Hochfelder in last
week's "Felix". Rather an
interesting point of view is
put forward as regards the
exploitation of the students
by the bourgeoisie. This
class is responsible for cal-
culating the future increased
value of us students as a re-
sult of our education. Does
Sonia realise that by her let-
ter she might have provoked
some bourgeoisie exploiter
somewhere to thinking that
perhaps pure research in
science is rather unprofit-
able?
Just think of all those
intellectuals, who do little
teaching, turning out very
little profit for the bour-
geoisie — and being well
paid for it. What does she
feel like to be a potential
destroyer of one of the sec-
tions of our life untainted by
the profit motive?
I feel the bourgeoisie
should be very grateful to
Sonia for pointing out such
an efficient system for mak-
ing the most from education.
One wonders why they do
not take immediate action.
Yours sincerely,
CHRIS STEVENS.
Boring
Sir,
A glance at a substantial
part of your Letters Page last
week prompted me to ask
the following question.
If I were to translate a
few pages from a particular-
ly boring book, such as the
Patagonian edition of "Mein
Kampf", and sandwich the
resulting tract between the
word "Sir" and my signa-
ture, would you print it (with
perhaps a neat heading such
as "Fascist Contracep-
tions")?
Yours quizzically,
ADOLF VON WEASEL-
GROPE,
President, C.8G. Y.N.S.S.S.
Responsi-
bility
Sir,
The responsible Union.
One year a levy on Hall
fees for a new Hall of Resi-
dence was decided upon. The
following year there was an
attempt to cancel it.
One week there was a
decision to get students as a
body of Union members to
write letters to the Under-
Secretary of State at the
DES. The following week this
was cancelled.
The responsible union. '
Yes, I know, it isn't neces-
sarily "the Union Exec"
which does this. It is a num-
ber of those people who try
to guide Union policy with
their shortsighted, narrow
and sometimes ignorant mo-
tions, resolutions and de-
mands.
People who want to be
taken seriously should be-
have in a serious fashion.
Yours faithfully,
DORI SCHMETTERLING.

R ACTION!
A t long last after 3 U G M s the U n i o n is now going
to D O something about getting higher grants i n -
stead of simply making demands with nothing to back
them up.
The demonstration next Wednesday to the D E S and
the refectory boycotts to be launched bring us right
into the thick of the fight for higher grants. W i t h 42
colleges on rent-strike and many more running refec-
tory boycotts with the excellent demonstration of 500
students from Thames Polytechnic to the D E S last
Wednesday and that of 1,000 i n Southampton the
previous week, there is every sign that this grants cam-
paign is going to be the biggest success students have
ever had.
O U R C A S E
The justice of the claim is beyond doubt. N o t only
has our standard of living been slashed, not only is
there gross discrimination against married women and
students i n the F E colleges, but i n fact the last rise
in 1971 was a C O N . O u r parents are paying most of
it i n increased contributions — many of them either
cannot or will not pay them.
But reason has no effect on this Government. It
has taken over a year to agree to meet N U S to discuss
the claim. A n y trade union faced with a similar res-
ponse would have been out on strike months ago.
Unfortunately students cannot have the same effect
by striking but we must use what power we have —
the economic power of rent strikes and refectory boy-
cotts against the colleges and the disruptive power of
demonstrations, lecture boycotts (and of course refec.
boycotts as well).
So far the militancy of the nation-wide campaign
has won us two things:— firstly the D E S has finally
agreed to meet N U S on 27th Feb., secondly a number
of vice-chancellors have made public statements sup-
porting us.
R E F E C T O R Y B O Y C O T T S
The U G M voted for this tactic by a vote of the order
of 3 to 1 rejecting the threats made by V i c t o r J .
Mooney i n last week's Felix. W e must totally oppose
any suggestion of closing the U n i o n lower refectory
next year. It is becoming increasingly viable. If the
bar i n the U n i o n Lower lounge had been opened at the
beginning of term as it should have been the U n i o n
ref. might well have been breaking even due to the
increased custom attracted.
A s for Mooney's suggestion that the refectory staff
will take the boycotts as a personal insult, the boycott
is aimed at getting higher grants and the staff will
surely realise this — unless, of course, someone is
stirring up trouble to set the students and workers
against each other. T h e U n i o n is pledged to fight ag-
ainst any threat to jobs and we must take this pledge
very seriously indeed. W e can use our representation
on the Refectories Committee to fight redundancies but
in the last analysis its up to the union as a whole to
take action alongside the trade unions i n College if
this threat is made.
W E D N E S D A Y ' S D E M O
This must be seen as a part of the build up to the
big demo on Feb. 21st covering a l l colleges and uni-
versities i n the S.E. of England. B y marching to the
D E S we can firstly put some more pressure o n the
Government, secondly get press coverage and thirdly
involve hundreds of union members i n the campaign.
After the demo we won't just crawl back and lie down
again. W e have to keep up the activity, building up
to an even bigger turn-out on February 21st.
H O R R O R S T O R I E S !
The national (and local) press like the personal
touch. So if we want publicity on grants we read: " J .
Bloggs of I C is living on chips because his parents can't
(or won't) give h i m the £150 parental contribution he
is due."
Anyone with grant difficulties out of the ordinary
should come into the union office and give the de-
tails to the President who will use the case history to
get the sort of favourable press coverage we need.
