FE£IX FINANCIA££Y
goes shopping
for a Bank!
DEREK CUMMINGS will be delivering the second of his four
General Studies lectures today at 1.30 p.m. in Physics Lecture
Theatre 1. (More than just a lecture, quite an experience in fact!).
Today he'll be grilling — and inviting you to grill — a leading
building society manager. If you think you're ever likely to buy a
house, you owe it to yourself to drop everything and go to the
lecture. See you there!
This week FELIX FINANCIALLY is
going to lower its sights just a little.
When the idea of a financial page
was first conceived, our intention was
to cover the whole spectrum of
money problems and particularly to
try to clarify some of the more ob-
scure points we are all likely to run up
against when we set out into the wide
world beyond the comforting walls of
Imperial College.
We've talked about such things as
isurance policies, home loans, house
prices and other related problems that
we are bound to face in the future.
And, thanks to our financial adviser
DEREK E. C U M M I N G S , we think we
have covered the field in a more than
usually refreshing and interesting
way.
In this issue, however, we felt we
ought to get down to the ground floor
and have a look at where most of our
money comes from. So we're going to
talk about banks and bank managers.
It happens that they are the sub-
jects about which DEREK E. C U M -
MINGS will be speaking when he de-
livers the third of his General Studies
lectures on February 13.
This lecture will be of interest to
anyone who has ever crossed swords
with a bank manager (and I imagine
most of us could show a few scars
from that particular battle) since Cum-
mings' guest that day will be the man-
ager of a bank less than a mile away
from I.C.
His name is Roger Roseboom. We
think he's a bank manager with a dif-
ference: a man who has the almost
revolutionary view that banks — or
rather his bank — should be in the
business of helping people rather than
just counting their money or writing
smoothly insulting notes when they're
a pound overdrawn.
He's coming along to answer your
questions about banks and their man-
agers — how they work, how they
think, their attitudes towards stu-
dents and so on.
He'll lend an ear next Tuesday and
— who knows? — he might even
lend you some money one day. But
he's a shrewd cookie and he'll be
looking for some penetrating ques-
tions.
But before we put him in the hot
seat, we asked our man' to give us his
ideas on what banks and bank mana-
gers ought to be about.
There's no question about it, bank-
ing is a lovely business. It makes
money on a l l sides. O n the one hand
they take your money a n d keep it for
you — a n d then invest it to make a
little profit for themselves. O n the
other hand, they lend y o u money —
and charge y o u interest on the loan.
It's marvellous. They can't lose.
O K , that's a very s i m p l i s t i c view of
a complicated organism. But very
often the simple approach reveals the
fact of a matter. A n d it is true. Banks
do make money out of money, wheth-
er guarding it or lending it.
But, pursuing the simple approach
makes it obvious that banks w o u l d n ' t
even be in business if it were not for
their customers. Customers are not
just important to them, they're abso-
lutely essential.
So a l l of y o u with bank accounts
ought to think about that, for a start.
Like Kitchener's army, your bank
needs y o u .
For that reason, the banks spend
millions on trying to attract custom-
ers. Leaflets, handouts, posters,
pamphlets, display advertisements
and television are a l l weapons they
use to try to get y o u to put your
money where their mouth is.
M y o w n favourite approach is in
the c o m m e r c i a l s h o w i n g the happy
home with the bank manager in the
broom cupboard — if only because I
know one or t w o bank managers I'd
love to lock in a cupboard a n d then
lose the key! But aside from that, this
ad points up a basic truth about the
banking business, namely, that your
fortune c a n depend on your bank
manager as an i n d i v i d u a l .
A n d this is a serious point. Unless
you have a lot of money, there are
bound to be occasions when the bank
can help you out of a fix. That's w h e n
you have to walk into the bank a n d
face the manager. Providing y o u r
needs are not outrageous, it's odds
on that he c o u l d help you, since bank
managers have a large degree of
autonomy and c a n lend fairly substan-
tial amounts of money without ref-
erence to anyone else.
But will he help you?
It depends on the man a n d on y o u .
After a l l , y o u chose h i m , didn't you?
W h e n you opened your first bank
account, y o u c o u l d have gone to any
bank in the land.
If your m a n turns you d o w n on
what you feel is a reasonable request,
then there's only one c o n c l u s i o n .
You've chosen the wrong bank man-
ager.
The answer to that is to shop
around. G o to a bank a n d have a chat
w i th the manager before y o u open an
account. Talk to h i m , tell h i m your
situation a n d what sort of services
you expect from the bank. A s k h i m
questions, pose a problem or t w o .
Y o u ' l l soon find out whether he's your
sort of bloke. If he i s n ' t — l e a v e .
Remember that, in your search, you
have one factor working for you. In
a highly competitive situation, where
all banks are going out of their way to
attract custom, they have been forced
to change their traditional outlook.
These days, they have to make them-
selves more attractive to the public.
They have to be prepared to lend
money on much less secure grounds
than they previously demanded. And
the decisions on questions like that
rest firmly with the man in the back
room—the manager.
They have the powers. The trouble
is that so many of them cannot be
bothered to use them, to take the
risks, to back their judgment. Luckily,
a lot of those gents in striped pants
and black coats are being pensioned
off and replaced by younger men with
a younger outlook.
Which type you choose is entirely
your concern. It's as simple as that.
And it's not only a question of be-
ing able to borrow a few quid, is it?
An intelligent and aware bank man-
ager will be a man with whom you
can confidently discuss the whole
range of money matters.
Banks have learned some painful
lessons in the past few years. They've
seen a lot of their business siphoned
off by such institutions as merchant
banks a n d the finance houses. They
got into the business w h i c h the banks
ought to have m o n o p o l i s e d . In fact,
the banks a l l o w e d it to go by default,
simply because they weren't prepared
to take the risks.
But these days, they're right back
into it. So why sign a hire purchase
agreement at an inflated rate of real
interest when you might be able to do
it more cheaply with a bank loan?
After a l l , a bank is just another
s h o p — e x c e p t that it sells cash. W h y
on earth shouldn't you, the customer,
feel entitled to use it on those terms?
// you don't do that, the reason
probably is that your bank manager
doesn't encourage you to do so.
If you're in that situation, leave
him to go on sending out his little
overdraft notes and go and find a
manager who knows what modern
banking is all about.
Look at it this w a y . If y o u went to
a doctor with a broken a r m a n d he
prescribed aspirin, y o u ' d soon find
another doGtor, w o u l d n ' t you?
A s w i t h medicine, so with finance.
A l l the facilities you are likely to need
are there — s o m e w h e r e . Y o u have to
find them. Or rather, find the m a n
who is prepared to make them avail-
able to you. , .
A n d that means going s h o p p i n g —
for a bank manager.
Just out of interest, FELIX
FINANCIALLY took DEREK E.
C U M M I N G S at his word. We
went to talk to a bank manager
—Roger Roseboom himself.
These are some of the things he
said:
"As I see it, banks have a
duty to offer a real service to
their customers, whether they be
students, property developers or
old age pensioners. And by ser-
vice I mean more than just tak-
ing their money and making
them wait in line to cash a
cheque. Service means listening
to and trying to understand their
problems and then, if it is in any
way possible, helping them to
solve them. That, I think, is a
bank manager's prime responsi-
bility to his customer.
"Now students. You ask what
my bank can offer a student that
another bank cannot. And the
answer is very little. Any bank
can offer the same facilities.
Whether they are used depends
on the manager.
"What I offer any student is
an intelligent dialogue and a
willingness to help them in the
best way I can. We want stud-
ent accounts—every bank does.
We realise that today's student
is tomorrow's man of property.
If any student from Imperial Col-
lege came to me and made it
clear he had worked hard to get
there, was working hard to get
his degree and was going to
make the grade when he left
college, I'd jump at the chance
to get his account in my bank.
I'd give him a cheque book and
a cheque card to back it with.
I'd handle his account without
charges—although I would have
to charge interest on any sum
overdrawn, naturally. And when
summer term came and times
were hard, I'd be prepared to
listen if he wanted something to
tide him over. I'd make it quite
clear that I wouldn't expect him
to go and blue the money on a
new tape recorder, but if he was
sensible and impressed me when
talking across my desk, I'd very
likely be able to help. I already
have a number of student
accounts, and I think I've been
fair with them all.
"It's my job to listen to prob-
lems and to try to unravel them.
After all, a talk with your bank
manager ought not to be like
an audience with the Pope. I
like to see my customers. I
make my judgements on them
through meeting them face to
face and I'll back my judgment
every time.
"That's what a bank mana-
ger's job is all about".
