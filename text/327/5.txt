THE ENVIRONMENTAL
CRISIS
-What it's all really about
p r e s t n t s
When y o u leave I.C. what are y o u expecting to do?
—get a good job with an expanding, science-based i n -
dustry, marry, settle down and raise a family i n condi-
tions of material comfort — central heating, car,
refrigerator, colour television, hi-fi, etc. — a n d then
when y o u are sixty, or maybe less, retire and live out
your last years i n a leisurely and contented manner?
Frankly, you have not got a hope i n hell of succeeding.
Today we live in an era of unprecedented material
affluence; but it cannot last much more than another
twenty years or so i n its present form. W h y is this? It is
simply because there will not be available sufficient
material resources to make
this possible. The shortage
will partly arise because
of the growing difficulty
of meeting the exponent-
ially - increasing require-
ments of the developed
world out of a finite
reserve. It will be exacer-
bated, however, by the
perfectly legitimate and
necessary increase in the
use of raw materials by
the developing countries.
Thus the demand will not
only increase exponenti-
ally at the rate of ' x ' %
say, but the magnitude of
'x' is also liable to in-
crease.
The situation is made
even more serious by the
fact that, not only do
enough resources have to
be found to produce the
goods we require, but we
must also find additional
resources to enable us to
control the pollution we
thereby generate. Pollu-
tion of the environment is
something which, not sur-
prisingly, we want to elim-
inate; but its prevention is
something which, in con-
ventional economic terms,
we shall be increasingly
unable to afford. We allow
it to occur at our peril, for
once sufficient quantities
of pollutants are released
to upset the basic proces-
ses of the biosphere, there
is really no knowing what
the effects will be on the
various forms of life on
the planet, including our-
selves and the plants and
animals on which we rely
for our food. Indeed it
appears from recent re-
search1
that some of the
most fundamental bio-
spheric processes are only
just being discovered, let
alone understood in suffi-
cient depth to enable us to
predict how easily they
may be disturbed, or what
the resulting effects will
be!
Thus the environmental
crisis is not merely a col-
lection of localised, un-
related problems such as
pollution, noise, shrinking
countryside, etc., which it
is just convenient to lump
together under one head-
ing. It is much more fun-
damental than this, and is
basically concerned with
the material constraints
placed by nature upon
mankind's efforts to pro-
gress towards a more ideal
world. This is in sharp
contrast to conventional
political ideologies which
are mostly concerned with
the human constraints.
Things have come to a
head because industrial
civilisation has for too long
allowed itself to accept in
a relatively uncritical man-
ner, as a measure of what
is good, the rate of in-
crease of material wealth.
This has been a workable
standard until now because
our demands upon the
earth's resources have been
easily satisfiable. Such a
situation cannot, by defin-
ition, continue for ever
and we are now in the un-
comfortable position of
seeing that, having due re-
gard to the political reali-
ties of the world today, a
major disruption of the
growth process is going to
occur well within the life-
time of present-day stud-
ents.
Needless to say, such a
perturbation will have
colossal economic and
political repercussions. 1
may have given the i m -
pression earlier that the
'environmental thesis' can
be regarded as an alterna-
tive to conventional poli-
tical ideologies; if so I
apologise. F o r any politi-
cal theory to be complete
it must obviously have due
regard to both the physical
and human realities of the
current world situation.
What, therefore, does the
environmental argument
imply in terms of the con-
ventional left-right political
debate?
First let us deal on a
global scale. If one asks
the average intelligent per-
son in this country how
they can justify living in
conditions of material
affluence whilst the major-
ity of the world's popula-
tion l i v e s i n relative
poverty, they will proba-
bly say something to the
effect that, life being what
it is, civilisation develops
in some areas faster than
in others and that we
needn't really worry about
being so rich since the
poorer countries will i n
time develop and catch us
up. One of the most i m -
portant political effects of
the environmental argu-
ment is that it exposes this
idea for the absolute non-
sense that it is. T h e poorer
countries of the world have
no hope of a l l simultan-
eously enjoying the present
European-type standard of
living since there are not
nearly sufficient resources
to enable them to do this.
Of course we must not
make the mistake of
assuming that all the
peoples of the world will
necessarily want to de-
velop i n the same indus-
trial manner as today's
'developed' countries have.
However, it is apparent
that very many countries
are intent on doing just
this, and that they are
being greatly encouraged
in their efforts by the de-
veloped world. Further-
more it would be cruelly
unrealistic to deny that the
developing countries will
have to greatly increase
their use of resources
simply in order to bring
their material standard of
living up to a minimum
acceptable level.
A s far as politics within
the developed world is con-
cerned, the environmental
argument totally trans-
cends the conventional
left-right dichotomy. It has
been suggested, rather ir-
responsibly 1 think, that
the environmental crisis
has been caused solely by
capitalism and that all we
have to do is to change to
a socialist system and the
problem will automatically
disappear. This is not true
since the problem can only
be solved by abandoning
the ideal of non-stop econ-
omic growth in material
terms, and not merely by
changing the way in which
the fruits of our labours
are distributed. This of
course does not mean that
the left-right argument is
now irrelevant or unneces-
sary. It will naturally re-
main arguable as to what
is the most favourable
political system under
which to come to terms
with the present crisis.
1 have not covered here
every aspect of the prob-
lem by any means and I
hope to discuss some other
issues, particularly that of
population growth, i n a
further article.

M y last '"Broadsheet-in-Felix" article stimulated a
response I d i d not anticipate and which J h a d intended
to ignore on two grounds. Firstly, I do not like to, or
wish to, indulge i n pointless derogatory and back-biting
remarks about anyone but prefer to present my point
of view and facts i n a relatively straightforward manner
without attacking any particular individual. M y last
article was not aimed at anyone specifically a n d if
people felt" certain facts had been omitted they could
have merely said what these were (any other remarks
would surely be irrelevant to the point of the article).
Secondly, I refuse to get involved in a childish "slang-
ing-match" that would only serve to waste Felix space
and bore the rest of its readers. I shall therefore merely
answer the points raised i n the guildsheet article and
curious letter that appeared last week, without being
too nasty, and hope the matter Will subsequently be
dropped (with the exception of new developments of
course).
The letter by M r . van Weaselgrope is hardly worth
commenting on, not only because of its obvious lack of
seriousness, but because the writer has not the courage
of his convictions and is too cowardly to put his own
name to his literary excreta, but prefers to sling his
m u d and hide behind some pseudonym. I shall remark
however that the "revenge squad" that took the records,
files, etc., had not indulged in a mascotry raid before
and merely desired to annoy those concerned by re-
moving these articles which were promptly returned
within half an hour with apologies. A n y damage i n -
curred in a raid was of course accidental (not deliberate
as was claimed) and I notice when guilds retrieved the
shields they were not reluctant to leave the R.C.S. office
in a mess by knocking things over and pinching copies
of the latest Broadsheet (which they would have received
anyway, even though they have difficulty finding some-
one in guilds who can read).
This brings me onto the guildsheet article, I'm glad
to see Broadsheet is no longer the only C . C . V . publica-
tion to respond to the Felix editor's request for regular
opinion articles and hope that i n future guildsheet will
have something to say that is worth reading (unlike the
monotonous format and low standard of guildsheet
itself). I was a little puzzled at the fact that the editor
did not write the article (although judging by what I've
seen of guildsheet I doubt that it has one) and instead
this was done by a gentleman who apparently dates
bearded young ladies (I draw this conclusion from the
fact that he was uncertain of my sex at the start of the
article but managed to guess right by the end—well
done, sir!). I also wondered why this article was on the
sports page, considering the unnecessarily nasty com-
ments it contained, its hardly cricket, is it chaps? Per-
haps they are trying to initiate a new sport—Ron bash-
ing! Well, M r . Hanson should "get his facts right", had
not the guilds twats i n their office attempted to throw
one of our valiant lads over the balcony to the ground
some ten feet below then perhaps their cheap ashtray
would not have got broken in the scuffle. Admittedly,
some letters for the guilds float got broken, but M r .
Hanson has exaggerated the actual number from four
to his "breaking half the letters".
I forgot to mention that the R.C.S. sign W A S seen
by our lads i n the infamous glass cabinet but no attempt
to retrieve it was made since the cabinet was locked.
Perhaps I should add that the shields are still in our
possession as is M r . Newman's (guilds president) hat
following the M o r p h y Day antics and that mysterious
V . C . anchor (beautifully painted in the R.C.S. colours)
was wheeled into the R.C.S. U . G . M . last Tuesday.
The general feeling of those associated with Broad-
sheet is that mascotry is to be encouraged as long as it
is done by "sleight of h a n d " and does not degenerate
into open warfare, which was regrettably becoming the
case at the end of last term. 1 therefore hope that any
developments this term are of a more sedate and sophis-
ticated manner.

ON DEMOS
Last Wednesday a very
successful demonstration
was held by students from
Thames Poly and E r i t h
Poly. They marched from
U L U to the D E S by
Waterloo station shouting
"Grants U p " , "Thatcher
Out", "Tories O u t " and
" C a n you live on £275
p.a. M r s . Thatcher?". O r -
ganised by rank and file
action committee, many
were angry at the lack of
leadership which N U S
had given. A l l they were
told was that they would
not get much support, and
that they should wait for
the day of action on Feb-
ruary 21st. M a n y of them
being on discretionary
awards or getting no
grants at all, they were
not deterred.
There are people at I C
who say the same about
our demo tomorrow, but
we will not be deterred
either. The rapid price i n -
creases and the effects of
the growing trade war, the
possible cancellation of
Concorde and the subse-
quent cutback in jobs for
technologists make it es-
sential that we come out
now to defend our demo-
cratic rights. A l l students
who want to help make
this the most successful
campaign ever and wish
to steward, make banners
or help with mass leaflet-
ing on Wednesday morn-
ing should contact the
Union Office.
