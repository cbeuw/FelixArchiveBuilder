TAKE
A LUTE
TO THE DES
" T A K E A L E T T E R T O T H E DES" was
quashed at Thursday's Union Meeting as the
primary motivation and slogan for tomorrow's
demonstration to the Department of Educa-
tion and Science (DES) on South Bank organ-
ised by the I C U Grants Action Committee.
A motion submitted by Piers Corbyn stating I C U ' s
belief that letters sent to M P s or the D E S should be
on an unofficial and individual basis was carried, leav-
ing the secondary slogan
"Demand a living grant"
as the main line of the
demonstration. L e t t e r s
will, however, be handed
in to the D E S .
The demonstration will
assemble on the Mechan-
ical Engineering concourse
at 1.15 p.m. on Wednes-
day 7th (tomorrow) and
march to South Kensing-
ton underground station,
where participants will
board a train for Black-
friars. The march proper
will take place from
Blackfriars station to the
D E S building. John Lane,
f C U President, explained
to " F E L I X " that the
march had to take this
somewhat unusual route
because of the limitations
on marches within a mile
of Westminster: the D E S
falls into this zonal re-
striction.
John Lane is expecting
a large measure of sup-
port from IC students, and
hopes that hundreds of
you will turn out. The
demonstration is exclusive
to Imperial College —
Thames Polytechnic had a
similar one last week sup-
ported by 200 students.
The first national demon-
stration will be on Febru-
ary 21st, when the N U S is
organising seven regional
demonstrations, one of
which will be in London.
This will be followed by a
"National Day of A c t i o n "
on M a r c h 14th, essentially
a further series of demon-
strations.

5 PER CENT OF
IC GRADUATES
STILL
UNEMPLOYED
5 % of I C students who graduated last summer were
still unemployed by mid-December, according to the
A n n u a l Report for 1971-2. M o r e students than ever
are now going into accountancy, banking, actuarial
work and the Stock Exchange: between 1965 and 1971
the percentage of students with first degrees going into
"legal, commerce and others" categories of employment
rose from 3.1 to 13.9.
The other main finding of the report is a drop in
applications for undergraduate courses of 12.1% and
a drop in anticipated admissions of nearly 8%. The
intake in 1971 was only 877, and the total number of
students rose by only 0.6% to 3,920, made up of 2,472
(63%) undergraduates and 1,448 (37%) postgraduates.
This year's estimated student total of 4,048 would indi-
cate a rise of only 0.33% over last year.
Financially, I C succeeded in making a surplus of
£114,000 over expenditure of £10,430,000 last year,
which will be carried forward into the new quinquen-
nium. The insured value of the buildings in I C comes to
£50.5 millions — with furniture and fittings, £66m.

DING-A-LING
SOUNDS
I've just come back from one of the most enjoyable
concerts I've been to for some time. F u l l of good old
rock and roll, which you can't get fed up with no
matter how many times you've heard it before.
The Rocking Devils did a fine job of warming up
the audience, turning out such vintage numbers as
"Lets G o D o the H o p " , "Little Darling", "Teenager in
Love", " R u n a r o u n d Sue" and " H o w a Nagila", the
latter being played at the back of his neck. They simu-
lated the part well, even to the greased back hair and
playing the guitar while kneeling on the ground. Hav-
ing been on the pub and club circuit before, they were
quite overcome by the hot reception they deservedly
received, and continued long after they were due to
finish with more numbers from Bill Haley, Elvis Pres-
ley, and Eddie Cochrane. One thing they could have
done would have been to move closer together, as the
stage looked ridiculously empty.
After the interval C h u c k Berry's band, consisting of
M i c k Clarke (guitar), George F o r d (bass) and Dennis
Elliot (drums) turned in a very short set before they
were joined by the man himself. A t his entrance every-
one on the floor rose to their feet, presumably because
the people at the front wouldn't sit down, and they
wanted to see too.
His set was quite predictable with all the old classics
" R o l l Over Beethoven", "School Days", "Sweet Little
Sixteen", " C a r o l " , and " M e m p h i s " which he did with
all his usual fire, playing his guitar from his waist, his
hip, horizontal, vertical and every other conceivable
position while he hopped and jumped across the stage.
"Reeling and R o c k i n g " , his new single, has, T hear,
been sent to M a r y Whitehouse with the hope she gets it
banned and it emulates the same success as the song
they followed it with — " M y D i n g - A - L i n g " . This was
radically different from the recording at Lanchester,
and even funnier. They finished with "Johhny B
Goode", and C h u c k was off the stage and in his car
ready to leave while his band finished the song off, —
the first concert I've been to without hearing an encore.
