FELIX Friday 17 june 2011 23
Scorpio
This week, you’re nearing the end of
your shift driving night buses around
London when a guy with a fake leg tries
to get on without paying. When you stop
him he gets angry and starts to attack the
bus with the leg. You phone the police
and have him arrested...
Horoscopes
Aries
This week, you get a little hungry
around lunchtime, but you ignore your
urges because you... are on a diet. That’s
right. You’ve restricted yourself to only
eating cock once a day and lunchtime
hunger pangs or no, there’s no way
you’re giving up your morning dick...
Taurus
This week, you finish your exams and
celebrate by getting well and truly
sloshed in the Union. You wake up
the next morning, pretty hungover but
feeling quite good about the world.
However, when you lift the covers you
notice that you’re missing a leg...
Gemini
This week, you look at yourself in the
mirror and say, “my god, what a hand-
some bastard.” Your girlfriend hears you
and warns, “If I hear you being that ar-
rogant once more, I’ll fuck your brother
again...” When your brother visits later
that day, you know she’s not kidding...
Cancer
This week, you’re in the Union chat-
ting to a really beautiful girl when she
says, “Can I show you something?” and
detaches her fake leg. You’re kind of
shocked but also totally impressed. You
point behind her, shout “Hey it’s Colin
Firth!” and run off with her leg...
Leo
This week, you’re polishing your
knuckles in preparation for a good old
game of fisticuffs on the Queen’s Lawn.
When the Rector removes his shirt, re-
vealing a rippled bulging physique, you
begin to wonder if you’ve underestimat-
ed your opponent.
Virgo
This week, you’re standing at the bus
stop when a guy suddenly appears with
a fake leg. He offers to sell it to you for
the extremely reasonable price of one
bus journey. When you politely decline
he takes offence and loudly calls you, “a
bigoted, racist, hate-filled moondoogle.”
Libra
This week, the clouds make way for the
sun, but in your rush to take advantage of
all that glorious vitamin D, you trip on
the steps at the entrance to the library, fall
and hit your head, and die. Bad times.
But on the plus side, you get given an
extra week to finish your project report...
Sagittarius
This week, you get the term dates wrong
and book your family holidays a week
early. You get no sympathy for your
mistake and are left behind, finishing your
project report in the library. You get a card
from your parents, apparently they’re
“fucking like rabbits.” Cheers Dad...
Capricorn
This week, you put a young fake leg-
wielding student in the cells to cool off
for the night. While alone with one of
your police co-workers you say, “hey,
how about me and you, you know?” She
looks you in the eye and calmly says,
“I’m sorry. You’re too fucking ugly.”
Aquarius
This week, a headless chicken bursts
into your bedroom and screams in a
thick Scottish brogue: “GOOD GOD
MAN, IT’S MURDER OUT THERE!”
Well that’s what you interpret from the
disturbing bubbling emanating from its
neck. You sigh and go back to sleep.
Pisces
This week, the police put you in the cells
and take away the fake leg you were car-
rying. You’re sad. You want a new fake
leg. You begin to chew off your own leg.
When candy explodes from your arteries
instead of blood, you realise that you’ve
been taking too many pills again...
DRUNKEN
MATE OF
THE WEEK
Ahhh I’ve been looking for a fool-proof way of cumming in my own mouth... Cheers bro!
