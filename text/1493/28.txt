2nd annual
ARCS
awards
celebrate
sports at
Imperial
L
ast Friday, Sport Imperial
hosted the second annual
Imperial ARCS (Appreci-
ate, Recognise and Cel-
ebrate Sport) award cer-
emony championing those who have
contributed to sport at Imperial Col-
lege over the past year. The event was
attented by over 140 guests including
nominees for awards, supporting team
members, coaches, teaching staff from
Imperial, various officials, sponsors and
partner organisations.
Guests were treated to a selection of
snacks on arrival as well as a generous
spread of alcoholic beverages which
made sure that some of the contingent
was suitably well lubricated before the
evening’s events got underway. After
an introduction by head of Sport Impe-
rial, Neil Mosley, the guests were treated
to a reception by the England Rugby
Union 7’s Head Coach, Ben Ryan, who
had come dressed in an England Rugby
Union polo to vanquish any thoughts that
he may not have been the real McCoy.
Ryan presented a thoroughly descrip-
tive, informative and above all interest-
ing story of his life and how he came into
representing England at schoolboy level
he went to Loughborough University to
study a Sports science degree. Incred-
ibly, Ryan recounted how 130 students
turned up to the ‘Fresher Rugby Trials’,
at Imperial we are still working to get
such a turn out. Thirty of that number
played at centre, where Ryan plied his
trade. Of those thirty, ten had schoolboy
international honours, an unbelievable
statistic. Ryan recounted how he failed
his first year focusing too intently on
playing rugby and the associated social
life rather than being a conscientious
student. Although he failed to disclose
what team he played for at Loughbor-
ough, we shall give him the benefit of
the doubt and believe that he played for
the 1s. Following his first year, Ryan
knuckled down to work and eventually
possessing his current position within the
England Rugby Union setup. Few people
would have been previously aware of
Ryan as the 7’s form of Rugby Union
is only just gaining prominence, yet he
has been in his current job since 2007.
Ryan informed the audience how, after
