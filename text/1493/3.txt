Winners of this year’s Union awards
were announced on Monday at the final
Union Council meeting of the academic
year.
The awards recognise those working
across the Union, from clubs and
societies to representation, with a belief
that ‘those who have gone over and
above what is expected of them should
be recognised.’
Of the 109 individuals nominated
for awards, (consisting of Colours,
Outstanding Services Awards and
Union Fellowships) 80 were decided
to have met the necessary criteria to
receive an award.
At the Council meeting, special
praise was reserved by Union President
Alex Kendall for two award winning
individuals.
Kendall commended Dan Wan, who
has received an Outstanding Services
Award, for his role in publicising and
helping to organise December’s Life
Sciences protests.
Additionally, Fellowship winner
Nathaniel Bottrell was lauded for his
extensive work in Union minibus
training, with Kendall claiming that
trips requiring the use of vehicles
could not have gone ahead without him
helping individuals to become approved
drivers.
Christopher Birkett and Jenny Wilson
received the highest accolade possible,
a Fellowship with Distinction, thereby
being deemed by the Union to have
made ‘an innovative development to
the work of the Union such as to leave a
positive legacy that will make a lasting
impression for future members.’

Fellowship with Distinction
Two Imperial professors have been
recognised on the Queen’s Birthday
Honours List, which was published last
Saturday.
Professor Nigel Brandon, Director of
Imperial’s Energy Futures laboratory,
has been awarded an OBE alongside
Professor Elisabeth Paice, Visiting
Professor of the Professorial Department
of Surgery.
Professor Brandon received his OBE
for services to relations in science
between the United Kingdom and China.
Brandon has been a leading figure
behind facilitating partnership between
scientific communities in both the UK
and China, resulting in collaborative
projects between the two countries on
the issue of clean and renewable energy.
Professor Paice was recognised for
her services to Medicine. Paice has
acted as Dean Director of Postgraduate
Medical and Dental Education for
North Thames from 1995 to 2001 and as
Dean Director of London Deanery from
2001 until 2009. She developed a new
educational commissioning system as
Acting Director of Medical and Dental
Education at NHS London from July
2009 until April 2010 and was named
as NHS Mentor of the Year 2010 last

The decision of Union Council on Mon-
day to award Honorary Life Member-
ship (HLM) of the Union to only five
of six Sabbatical Officers, excluding
Deputy President (Finance & Services)
Ravi Pall, was overturned at a meeting
of the Union Court on Wednesday.
The rejection of the Council’s decision
arose after a complaint that the proce-
dure of the HLM vote was unconstitu-
tional as the Sabbatical Officers were
asked to leave the room while the other
Council members debated the awards.
The Sabbatical Officers were also not al-
lowed to vote. In the constitution it stip-
ulates that all full members of the Union,
which includes Sabbaticals, have a right
to participate in all Council discussions.
Although the practice of asking the
Sabbaticals to leave the room is a long-
standing unwritten rule, the Court ruled
that it violated the Union’s constitution.
In the decision to deny Ravi Pall Hon-
orary Life Membership, some Council
members cited what they deemed to
be an unsatisfactory effort throughout
his year in office. The RCC Chair, Na-
thaniel Bottrell, pointed to the Deputy
President’s short written report for that
Council meeting as indicative of his ef-
forts. The members subsequently voted
whether to confer Pall with member-
ship, with five voting for and six against,
along with 10 abstentions. Union Presi-
dent Alex Kendall explained his misgiv-
ings about the Council’s decision: “Ravi
has done a great job this year and has
been a very proactive Sabb. He has a
strong personality and this can some-
times test some people’s patience but he
is a good man and has had to deal with
some tricky issues this year.”
Ravi Pall argued that because a lot of
his work involved sensitive staffing is-
sues, it was impossible to report fully
to Council. He said that Council mem-
bers “massively underappreciated the
amount of effort [he] had put in” due to
the loss of two permanent staff mem-
bers, the Finance Manager and Com-
mercial Services Manager.
While no complaint was made against
the result during the meeting, one made
afterwards led to the issue being dis-
cussed at Wednesday’s meeting of the
Union Court.
Union Court Chair Hamish Common
said that it was “with a heavy heart” that
he quashed Council’s decision because
Council had not knowingly acted im-
properly and that it was common sense
to ask the Sabbaticals to leave the room
while they were being discussed; he
suggested that it would be a good idea
that the constitution be changed to allow
this practice to continue.
An emergency meeting of Council
met on Thursday lunchtime but it was
abandoned as it was not quorate. An-
other meeting has been scheduled for
the 22nd of June, when Council will
again decide on HLMs for the sabbati-
cal team.
