The Union has been forced to clarify
that no plans for the future of the Sum-
mer Ball have been set in stone after
several Deputy Presidents raised con-
cerns following last week’s Felix article.
Union President Alex Kendall said that
the statement given to Felix regarding
plans for the future of the Ball gave the
“wrong impression” that the decisions
had already been made and emphasied
that student input would be sought and
included in future decisions.
In a letter printed this week in Felix the
Union admit that the “idea and vision”
of moving the Ball to Hyde Park may
not “necessarily reflect the wishes of the
student body” and reassures that no de-
cision would be taken without properly
engaging the student body: “Any change
of venue would need to be discussed at
[…] the Council of the Union.”
The statement originally sent to Felix
last week, from a senior Union official
and approved by the Union President,
laid out plans to expand the Sum-
mer Ball into “a larger student ball for
London” co-ordinated by the Union.
The clarification was forced after three
Deputy Presidents (Education, Welfare,
and Clubs & Societies) and two mem-
bers of the Union Executive Committee
raised concerns that the statement made

Union forced to
clarify future of
Summer Ball
No concrete long-term strategy
in place says Union
Charles Poon
to Felix suggested that concrete plans
had been put in place when they had in
fact not.
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)
Heather Jones said, “I felt it necessary
to clarify to the student body that the
Summer Ball is decided by students and
that no long-term decisions had been
approved.”
Alex Kendall said that Felix had not
misrepresented the statement and that the
Union is still of the opinion that a bigger
Summer Ball would be better, explaining
that the way to have more high-profile
live acts without increasing the cost is to
expand the Ball. However, he conceded
that it had been made to seem that a con-
crete decision had already been taken. In
the letter the Union admit “this is not a
strategy that has been brought before the
Executive Committee of the Union or to
Union Council and voted upon.”
The letter says that “ultimately it is
not [the Union’s] opinion, but yours that
matters” and urges students to “come
forward and make your voice heard.”
The original statement also said that
the Union had an “expression of inter-
est” from UCL on collaborating on
the Ball next year. However, Matthew
