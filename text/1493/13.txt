COMMENT
H
ow many times have you
ever wanted to tell some-
one who is apologis-
ing to you, to **** off?
Not because they slept
with your best friend, but just because
of the grovelling, sickening nature of
it. I amaze myself about how fervently
I want to sometimes. But equally, how
often has an apology barely scratched
the surface of the wrong it is attempting
to right?
These two examples are relatively easy,
but what about the middle ones, when
someone probably should apologise and
does? There are various approaches one
could take. Some people thank them. I
am not so sure about this, but it would
show an acknowledgement of the apolo-
giser’s effort. However if you think they
should apologise, why thank them? I sup-
pose the opposite reaction would just be
to say nothing and walk away, but this is
hardly positive re-enforcement. What if
they need to do it again? The chances are
that they simply will not bother. Telling
them “It’s fine/It doesn’t matter” is one
I have done in the past, but I feel a pang
because often, it does matter. Though I

apologies that make
for an etiquette
minefield”

flatshare all add to the pile. There is even
an unwritten rule about the use of mobile
phones on trains, i.e. the more people
there are on a train, the more you should
try to avoid using your phone. Of course
some people do not care about such rules,
but everyone around them is silently fir-
ing large telepathic daggers squarely at
them.
I suppose the question is partly ‘why
does any of this happen at all?’ Why do
I worry about what to say to someone
when they apologise to me, or when a
woman with a predilection for 80s fash-
ion invites me to a party I don’t want to
go to? We are supposedly a less ‘but-
toned-up’ society than we were 50 years
ago. People dress differently, and formal
titles are less common. However casual
racism and people who wash only once
a week have also become less common.
Ironic really, as people who indulge in
these activities are normally called com-
mon. Or at least are thought of as com-
mon – no one is allowed to say it, that
would be snobbish. Etiquette is clearly as
tricky a mistress as ever she was – be her
in a spandex boob tube or grovelling for
your forgiveness.
am pleased they have said so, I do not
necessarily want to wear that pain on my
arm. I want to move on. I suppose there
is the big hug and “I’m-so-pleased-you-
called” combination, but anything more
clearly from a cheap American drama, I
cannot imagine.
Dodgy-coloured hair, breast augmenta-
tions and accents that make me want to
rip off my ears aside, it is not just apolo-
gies that make for a modern etiquette
minefield, but a variety of ‘new’ situa-
tions. I was asked if I wanted to go speed
dating last week. I am reliably informed
that this has changed a lot – it is not the
lonely stalker-fest that it is believed to be.
But that does not help with the etiquette
of the situation. Clearly in one’s three
minute slot, the need for jokes about un-
christian acts with a banana are unlikely
to go down well. After all, one has hardly
met the person, it is just not the time.
However a more circumspect approach
might just leave me with nothing to say,
and so I would come across much like
‘Tim nice but dim’.
It is not just these sorts of things people
worry about – what to say and when,
how to behave, what one expects in a
I
’m a bit embarrassed. Y’see,
you’ve caught me at quite an in-
opportune moment. I was going
to write this letter on something
important, I’m sure of that. The
only thing is... I can’t remember what
I was going to write about. You don’t
happen to know, do you? Wait! Hah, got
it! Memory, that’s what it is.
It’s a funny thing, isn’t it? For a start,
we’re not quite sure where or what it
is. We know roughly where to find it
– temporal lobe, second left at the hip-
pocampus – but after that, our sat-nav
breaks down. And while we can come
up with some pretty theories to explain
mostly how it works, we still haven’t
got all the kinks worked out.
Déjà vu, for example. I, myself, have
it from time to time. Some say it’s a
neural quirk, adding a notion of famil-
iarity to the novel but I’m not entirely
convinced. Some mornings I wake up
thinking what an odd dream I just ex-
perienced, that it could never happen,
only to be left slightly spooked when
it comes to pass a few weeks later. It’s
something like having my very own Or-
acle of Delphi behind my retinas.
Of course, remembering things be-
fore they’ve happened is strange in
itself but there are still oddities even
when causality flows in the proper di-
rection. Despite being the foundation
of my current academic achievements,
I can remember very little of my days
in primary school. Fair enough, it was
a long time ago. And yet, I remember
vividly Mrs. Gulliford shooting me the
most poisonous look after I yawned in
class. This one, inconsequential mem-
ory is the only thing I can pluck from
the murky mists of that past. So far, this
pearl of synaptic-firing has been of no
use to me whatsoever and I can’t envis-
age a future when it ever would. But it
is implanted so firmly in my conscious-
ness I know I’ll never forget it, even to
my final days.
That’s the strange thing with mem-
ory, or one of many at least. We don’t
remember what is important, what is
useful: the bones of the wrist before an
exam, the interview time with a presti-
gious company or the phone number of
that girl from Metric. Instead, our heads
are filled with junk: the word “cus-
tard” in five languages, the number of
pecks in a bushel, Ann Widdecombe’s
birthday.
But, then again, I might have this all
wrong. Obviously an ordered and de-
tailed memory is useful where exams
are concerned but life is more than a
test. Maybe there is some gatekeeper
in our mind, more acute and astute than
we could ever hope to be. Maybe this
subconscious bouncer only retains what
really is important. If I were ever exam-
ined on my life, I know I’d never get
100%.
Memory is one of the things that
make us who we are. Even in Imperial,
a personality isn’t formed by learning a
textbook by rote. It’s crafted over time
through myriad interactions with those
we know, those we love, those we hate.
We are a thousand conversations. If we
couldn’t remember them, who would
we be?
I can’t remember what kind of bike
I was riding when I got lost in Pon-
typridd but I can remember how glad
I was to see my Dad again, even as he
gave me a rollicking. I can’t remember
what they asked when I came here for
my admissions interview but I can still
feel the thin film of sweat that coated
me as I walked out of the room. I can’t
remember what film we went to see on
our first date but I remember perfectly
how my girlfriend looked, stood there in
Gloucester Road Station. This memory-
demon has better things to worry about
than facts and figures, dates and times.
In fact, I can’t even remember the date
properly. I know it was roughly a year
ago. Almost exactly a year. Wait, actu-
ally, it was a year ago to... Oh dear!
The Summer Ball is, for many,
an opportunity for a final party
with friends before the summer
holidays or even the job market
for anyone finishing their degree
and so, rightly, students want a
say in how they say goodbye to
their year or even their degree.
The fact is that students were
involved in making this decision.
You elected the Deputy President
(Finance and Services), the Presi-
dent and the Ents committee to
do this job.
These 6 students, elected by
the student body to put on this
event (amongst other things) de-
cided to make changes, some
forced by practical necessity, the
borough Council imposing restric-
tions changing what we can do
and when, and some out of choice
but it’s important to remember,
these are the people that you,
the student body elected to make
these decisions. It’s also impor-
tant to remember that you had a
say in whether or not these deci-
sions stood. When Union Council
passed reports by the DPFS that
stated more of college would be
used, the event would start ear-
lier and that there would be no
marquee on the Queen’s Lawn
students had a chance to make
the changes they wanted.
Last week an article was pub-
lished saying that the Union has
a long term strategy to expand
the Summer Ball to Hyde Park.
We’d like to clarify that this is not
a strategy that has been brought
before the Executive Committee
of the Union or to Union Coun-
cil and voted upon. It is an idea
and a vision for the future from
the people that the student body
elected to put on this event – not
necessarily one shared by every
student or student representa-
tive but the vision of the people
students voted for. Any change
of venue would need to be dis-
cussed at the Executive Commit-
tee and Council of the Union.
A Summer Ball in Hyde Park
doesn’t necessarily reflect the
wishes of the student body – ul-
timately it is not our opinion but
yours that matters. This year’s
Summer Ball will be a fun day for
everyone who comes but if there
are changes you’d like to make
for next year then please come
forward and make your voice
heard. The Union

future of
Summer Ball
