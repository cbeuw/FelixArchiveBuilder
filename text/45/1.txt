ffie e f f o r t s of the F i l m Industry t o p o r t r a y
Science and S c i e n t i s t s have long been regarded by
the v i c t i m s w i t h a sense o f r e s i g n a t i o n r e m i n i -
scent of an e l d e r l y gentleman being aped by a
small boy. So i t i s that we snuggle deeper i n t o
the two-and-threes and g r i n smugly as the bearded
p r o f e s s o r absent-mindedly dressed i n pyjamas pours
samples from reagent b o t t l e s i n t o a r e f l u x s t i l l .
The scene i s u s u a l l y an unnamed l a b o r a t o r y , but
r e c e n t l y , sudden fame has come to I.C. i n the
f i l m "THE LOST HOURS".
Here a gentleman o f d o u b t f u l c h a r a c t e r i s
d e s c r i b e d aa "doing r e s e a r c h a t the C o l l e g e o f
S c i e n c e " .• 'One'a sllenj; m i r t h l a immediately
d i s p l a c e d by a v i d a t t e n t i o n as a plaque appears
on the screen i n s c r i b e d " i m p e r i a l C o l l e g e o f
Science and Technology", - the camera then pans
to r e v e a l that t h i s i s indeed the R.C.S.
The hero approaches b r i s k l y along Imperial
I n s t i t u t e Road and disappears i n t o the f r o n t door
of the R.C.S. Eager w i t h c u r i o s i t y we f i n d
ourselves next i n one o f the new chemistry
l a b o r a t o r i e s where our auspect seems to be
i n n o c e n t l y engaged on a r o u t i n e q u a l i t a t i v e
a n a l y s i s ; but i t seems a l s o that he has an
uneasy conscience s i n c e he has r e c e i v e d £2^000
from the murdered man (who i n c i d e n t a l l y wan a
crook) - " f o r research". This research, i t SjS
suggested, i n v o l v e d the supply o f c e r t a i n drugs
which, we have a l r e a d y deduced from the s t o r y ,
were administered to our hero i n an e f f o r t to
saddle him w i t h the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y f o r marder.
Here the scene moves from I.C. and, needless
to say, a l l turns out w e l l i n the end} w e l l ,
that i a , f o r our hero and J u s t i c e , but what o f
I.C?(

„ 'we are by now Hardened to the misrepresent

b e l i e v e , t h i s i s the f i r s t time that one of a
s p e c i f i c group of s c i e n t i s t s - members of I.C. -
have been accused of d e r e l i c t i o n o f t h e i r moral
duty. The f i l m implies that members of I.C.
are capable o f the abuse o f t h e i r r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s
towards S o c i e t y , and that they are people of
whom the innocent laymen must beware.

Treasury, announced in Parliament on Jan. 29th that
I.C. i s to expand to take 3000 students by 1957-62.
There are about 1650 at the moment. Expansion w i l l

priority for them as they become available. This
is the most practical step taken so far in the
realisation of a National College of Technology.

! UNION M E E T I N G
At the I.C. Extraordinary Union meeting held on
January 30th. J . UoKenna was elected as Guild*
representative on the Onion Council, succeeding
S.H. Wearne who has recently left the College. At
the meeting the President mentioned the statement madt
in the Commons and gave the good news that work i s to
begin this summer on extending the Union Building.
Two new storeys are to be added; the plan* include
a new Gym and changing rooms, Concert Hall, Snaek Bar
and a Bar extension. It i s also hoped that inoreased
Hostel space w i l l cater for at least twice a* many
residents.
The President also gave news or Uoronatlon year
plans. . His attempt to secure a p l o t f o r the Union
on the route had failed as only school children and
disabled servicemen can make mass bookings. The
President suggested, however, "that i t might be
possible to u n o f f i c i a l l y "book" a spot by having
t h i r t y or f o r t y Union members planted there f o r
several days before the Coronation. It i s planned
to hold a Gala I.C. Sports Day during Coronation week
with a dance at the Union i n the evening. The
President asked f o r volunteers to help organise a
U.L.U. Rag t o be held i n June, i n support of student
and other c h a r i t i e s . The Battersea Pleasure Gardens
are t o bn booked f o r the night of the Rag.
P O T T E D H I S T O R Y
FELIX has been i n v e s t i g a t i n g the history of the
animals' heads which were removed from the Lower Dining
H a l l at the end of l a s t term. They were presented round
about 1920 by Ewan Tulloch, who was at the" R.S.H. 1906-1909
and who won the D.3.0. and V..G. i n the Great W r . The
heads were shot i n A f r i c a , arid represented a complete cross
section of the A f r i c a n Antelope. Several of them were
record specimens as Mr. Tulloch only hunted f o r the not,
and chose exceptionally fine or a l t e r n a t i v e l y , decrepit
animals. They are mentioned i n Rowland Ward's book on the
subject. Mr, Tulloch rose to be President,, the Chamber of
Mines of Rhodesia, and became very widely known i n gold
mining c i r c l e s . He died at the end of l a s t year i n
Bulowayo.
The c o l l e c t i o n 'was valuable, and - t one time extended
into the Old Lounge, as w e l l as the Dining H a l l . The
heads were disposed of by the Maintenance Office on
i n s t r u c t i o n s from the Union.
