I.C. reached the f i n a l of t h f U.L. 3-a-side cup by
defeating, Sharing Cross Hospital
Playing No. 3, Kike Martin convincingly defeated h i t
opponent 9-2, 10-8, 9-1. From the beginning i t was f a i r l y
obvious which way the grime would go and Martin was never
r e a l l y extended.
Tony Williams easily accounted f o r the Charing Cross
No. 2 player i n three .^ick games 9-0, 9-3, 9-0. Here
again the result was never i n doubt and i t Y/as rather
disappointing from t h e spectators' point of view that
Williams never had t o r i s e to any great heights.
The most i n t e r e s t i n g game of the match was between
J e f f Kenyon (I.C.) and l a s t year's U.L. Captain
G.D.H. Shephard, the l a t t e r winning 9-4, 10-8, 4-9, 9-6.
Shephard with a tremendous reach produced some amazing
r e t r i e v i n g shots and t h i s coupled with an unaccountable
lapse i n Kenyon's shots down the walls resulted i n the
Hospital's lone v i c t o r y .
With three players of such S t i r l i n g q u a l i t i e s .
I.C. can enter the F i n a l w i t h high hopes o f adding yet
another trophy to the cases i n the Cld Lounge.
I.C.W.S.C. v FURZEDOWN
S o c c e r
l . C , a l t e r an unimpressive beginning, beat St. Johns
C o l l . , Cambridge on a damp grey afternoon at Harlington on
Sat. Jan. 24th. They might, with no i n j u s t i c e , have been
several goals down i n the f i r s t h a l f , y e t , i n the end i t was
a deserved v i c t o r y because t h e i r forwards could f i n i s h o f f
an attacking movement.
On t h e i r aecond-half from the two teams would have
driven spectators i f there had been any to d i s t r a c t i o n .
The .ineptness of the play was disappointing especially
considering the fact that l . C . had played so w e l l i n raid-
week to record a 4-4 drs.w against Westminster C o l l . Victories
are always welcome but l i t t l e pleasure i s ga.ined from such
drab games.
Playing i n much better fashion"I.C. drew with Kincrs 1-1
i n a U.L Leaprue match on Wed. 28th. Jan. The result was e
true r e f l e c t i o n on the game and i.e. must consider themselves
unlucky i n being out of the Cup since Kings' are i n the semi-
f i n a l .
Another v i c t o r y was credited t o the F i r s t XI (making i t
eight games without defeat); when playing against the College
of St. Mark e
c St. John the score was 5-1. I n a b l u s t e r i n g
wind the team mastered the conditions i n grand s t y l e and gave
a f i r s t c l a s s display of f o o t b a l l .

FOSTER TROPHY D I S I N T E R R E D
This cup was last Drought to the
public notice in 1905. It had been
given to the college in 1904 as a swimming
trophy and was for competition between
R.C.S. and R.S.M. Clad in sombre,
dignified costumes, our predecessors
competed for the cup i n both these years,
but for some reason never again.
Was i t the number of fatalities i n thesi
matches that caused the cessation, or did
tho- e long-sighted gentlemen foresee the
approaching raenaoe of I.C.W.A. and shun the
possibility of being seen i n knee-length
garb? Whatever the cause, not for nearly
half a century was the cup mentioned; indeec
ve have no record of i t , until in 1950 an
' jbservent gentleman in the bar noticed the
unusual shape of his pot and, since i t was
very early i n the evening, investigated
further.
Various Union and swimming club
officials have since viewed the find witu
some interest and returned i t to i t s place
among the empties: but this year we intend to clean
the dregs out and return i t to i t s original use.
Though we cannot hope to emulate our stalwart long-
panted predecessors, we intend to hold a gala, whicu
" i l l take place at Buckingham Palace Rd. Baths on the
evening of Tuesday 24th March. Owing to the slight
time lapse since the last gala, the captains of the
.college teams are having a l i t t l e difficulty in
mustering their sides. Large numbers of 'only ju t•
swimmers are requirecifor an event of this kind, and
any Union member wishing to give his support should
contact the Hon. Sec. I.C. Swimming Club.
There i s plenty of accommodation for Spectvioi-s
at the baths and your enthusiastic, vociferous support
will prevent the Foster trophy returning to the beer
dregs for another half century.
B U S B Y
In recent yearB changes in the English language/ have
occurred which are even more terrifying than those proposed
by A.R.B. The reference i s to wordB such as N.A.T.O., .
U.N.O., U.N.E.S.C.O., S.K.I.T.(South. Ken. Inst, of Technol-
ogy), W.U.S., etc. The latest addition to these contrac-
tions i s B.U.S.B.Y., which, believe i t or not, i s the new
word /or the British Universities Sports Board.
This body has been formed to provide truly represent-
ative British Universities' teams i n International sport.
Previously the D.A.U. (representing a l l but Oxford, Cambridge
and London), together with H.U.S. have selected the team for
the International Student Games. The new board represents
a l l Universities in Great Britain.
B.U.S.B.y. has affilated to F.I.S.u. (Federation Inter-
nationale du Sport Universitaire) as experience has shown
that the International Games conducted by this body are
kept entirely free from politics.
The various organisations represented on the o»^r<x
have agreed that i t i s desirable that the funds for financing
3ritish Universities' teams should be a "student concern" and
that no public appeal for funds should be made. Each organ-
isation has been asked to make special efforts to raise
funds.
It i s hoped that Great Britain w i l l be represented by
-.earns in Athletics, Fencing, and Swimming at the next
'.I.S.U. games to be held at Dottraund in August; howeverJfh*
jstimated cost of sending such teams i s £1,000. In addition
?unds are required to meet administrative costs of the board.1
.
U.L.A.U.'is anxious that London University gives the
lead in raising funds, and i t i s hoped that a l l colleges
iri.ll support this appeal. Details of appeal hops, dances-
etc, w i l l be posted in the Union. Please give your support.
