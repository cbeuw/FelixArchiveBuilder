/This year's First Lady at I.C.W.A., Eleanor (at home)
Rse (at college); Turnbull was born i n Glasgow just
twenty one years ago and s t i l l retains a refreshing Scottish
cadence i n her voice, although it's now seven years' since
ahe lived there.
She had a very normal childhood - she was a Brownie,
learnt to play the piano, collected stamps and even took
lessons i n ballet dancing, although she decided later that
she wasn't really intended to be another Fonteyn.
In spit* of her Scottish birth and education (the
Ratherglec Academy end the Glasgow High School for girls)
her reply to the question "Are you a Scottish Nationalist?"
Was en indignant, although possibly evasive "Do I look like
onet"
On moving down to England, Rae went to Sutton High
School and from there she came to I.C, to read Zoology.
Here we found that she was a sporting type ("please, not a
hearty type") playing squash, tennis and hookey, although sha
steadfastly refuses to run round Hyde *ark at 7 a.m. and so
qualify for the I.G.W.S.C. Athletic team. So i n her
second year at I.C. she became President of I.C.W.S.C.,
passing from that to her present exalted position - much to
her own surprise for she's an unassuming lass. As
President, she i s prepared to fifht for I.C.W^-.'s rights
to the last and keeps i t s affairs running smoothly.
In the likes - and - dislikes department, Rae likes
riding but not horses and likes pipe-smoking men but not

"smooth'' men. She's often to be found reading Vogue and
is interested i n fashion and elothes, but she hateja knitting.
A celebration w i l l be held when Hae finishes her first
sweater; Typically feminine, she likes flower* but im't
fond of spiders; and,unusually, she enjoys her work,
which i s at the moment a study of parasites on tropical fish,
nnA thinks badly of people who refer slightingly to
parasitologisxs, When i t comes to food and drink, she like*
Drambuie, Danish blue and tapioca pudding, but, isn't so keen
on chips or the idea of eating frog's legs.
In the culture line she's a low high brow with a
special fondness for the poetry of W.H. Davies. She wishee
she had more time to listen to music and to read, but finds
time to go to the theatre fairly often.
Her ambitions are to enjoy herself i n Canada where she.
hopes to be going next year and to pass her driving test.
Her views on marriage are "just the same as anybody else's"|
enlarging a l i t t l e , we discover that she wouldn't object to
being married but doesn't want to be tied to the kit ohm sink
too early.
Interesting experiences i n the past,? Well, she has
been interviewed by the Evening Standard quite recently, and
had her picture published i n the national press (not, she says
for the first time). She admits, rather oddly, to having
served on a welfare committee with two ladies and a
viscountess and she has worked as an unpaid, p'-rt-time
kennelmaid-eum-dog-trainer - "only they weren't house-trained
because they didn't live i n the house." This, we might
iadd. i s typical E.R.T. logic.
Rae i s often very vague and absent-minded, causing her
friends much amusement as she searches her room furiously
for the keys that are i n the lock anyw=y. But i n anf
crises or difficulty she remains unruffled, meeting the
situation with her typical one-sided smile and that expressive
Scottish noise that i s spelt "Och!" but sounds quite different.
Her decisions bear the stamp of shrewd oommonsense and she
speaks her mind with characteristic bluntnes*. And when,
as happens infrequently, she loses her temper - more often
with herself than not - the following few minutes are very
amusing for any uninvolved spectator.
Finally, she hates being asked questions about herself,
hates people probing into .her character, was only interviewod
for Felix with some difficulty and an a i r of martyrdom, and
w i l l positively hate and detest reading this "Profile".
