PROFILEâ€” PROF. SAUNDERS
It i s popularly supposed that to be a professor
and to be a crank are identical states. Popular
supposition also prescribes that a professor be be-
spectacled, distant, fragile and austere, a l l these
qualities being inseparable from that studious musty
wisdom which seems so unattainable to the struggling
student, and yet esential for academic success. How
reassuring i t i s fori the student to find that pop-
ular supposition i s confounded by the undeniable
presence in this corner of the Scientific World of
a Professor, large i n form and large i n outlook,
fond of the Good Things of l i f e , who i s an accomp-
lished sportsman, a success i n his academic sphere
and, moreover, a counsellor whose sunny countenance
dispels fear and the awe which s t i f l e s discussion,
and provides the understanding which passes on to
knowledge.
the Bean of City and Guilds does not regret
having been educated at T r i n i t y College, Cambridge;
in fact he i s one of the foremost of those who ad-
vocate the University as opposed to the Technical
School education. The latter he says i s not a
'complete' education. The truth of this i s well
borne out by his own rapid and diverse success.
From early beginnings as Lecturer in Applied Math-
ematical Physics at Imperial College, Professor
Saunders developed the hitherto almost unexplored
f i e l d of Heat Transmission and became a valuable
"boffin" in the recent war when he was on loan to
the Directorate of Turbine Engine Research, a
member of the aeronautical Research Council and
chairman of the Power Plants Committee. He i s s t i l l
chairman of several committees at the Ministry of
Supply and the Admiralty and i s a member of the
Mechanical Engineering Research Board; he has pub-
lished many original papers on his subject and, of
course, his Book, compiled in collaboration with
Dr. Fishenden, which iae confesses i s the only worth-
while work on the subject.
But this i s the sort of thing one expects of
Professors; they are supposed to be b r i l l i a n t .
However, one does not expect him to have a Bronze
Medal for skiing, to be a keen tennis player, an
accomplished pianist and a magician. No, these are
not the standard professorial attributes, but those
who know him find these attributes not so very sur-
prising. It seems the Dean .is 1'ortuna.te in having
command of himself to such an extent as to be cap-
able of complete relaxation. Never does his face
show the harassed, drawn look associated with high
pressure study and thought; his aspect i s rather
that of a tennis player who has just won three
straight sets and i s ready for more, or that of the
skier flushed with pleasure at the end of a long run.
The Professor i s essentially a family man. A
close friend of his has said that his son and two
daughters in their Surrey home are indeed fortunate
to have such a father; and an unostentatious family
man he appears to a l l who meet him. In the lecture
theatre he has that same personal touch that one can
imagine him using when operating his son's model
railway, t e l l i n g his family what to do in the garden,
or producing magic before a small audience. ( He i s
to lecture to the Radio Society on Magic in Decem-
ber - i t now seems indisputable that those valve
things and bits of wire are really just magic after
a l l ! ) One may say that Professor Saunders i s in
himself the answer to those who advocate sheer
brownbagging; singleness of purpose combined with
a m u l t i p l i c i t y of personal interests i s surely a
good guide to a successful and happy career.

To the Editor of Felix. 27 Oct. 1950
Sir,
We now have a Liberal Group of respectable size
in the Political Society and the Socialist Group
seems at last on the point of deciding if i t is
(a) Communist, (b) Labour or (c) a living proof of
the fundamental identity of these parties. We have
also had a particularly exuberant challenge from
Professor Levy. It therefore seems that when things
get sorted out we are in for some political fun this
term. May I on behalf of the Liberal Group say "Yes
please", and that are ready for anything. We are
particularly anxious to have a go at the collectiv-
ist left from the Red Dean ( Dr. Hewlett Johnson I
mean, of course! ) downwards, and refute their par-
ticular political phlogiston theory. We are also
ready to discuss policy with the Tory Group - ours,
or theirs if they can find any.
However, more of this anon.
Yours faithfully,
John Osborne.

To the Editor of Felix.
Sir,
In accordance with your invitation for modi-
fication of the form for the letter home, may I
suggest that the phrase 'your erring son1
be chan-
ged to 'your erring son/daughter'.
After a l l , there are at least 42 daughters in
the College at the moment and their interests
should not be neglected.
Yours faithfully,
II. Raged.

(Hear, hear! And i f Hiss Raged will let
me have her 'phone number, I will see
that her interests are not neglected - Ed.)

To the Editor of Felix.
Sir,
I wish to bring to your notice what I consider
to be a serious omission from Felix.
Before Freshers begin their lives at I.C.,
they reoeive quite a dossier of leaflets among
which is a reminder that they are members of U.L.U.
and they are urged to take an aotive interest in
the affairs of that Union.
Kenoe my surprise when I see no mention of
U.L.U. activities in the last two editions of
Felix.
I realise that there are other ways of fin-
ding out what is taking place., but I do think that
it would be helpful i f mention were made of the
more important events in U.L.U. and the other Col-
leges of London University.
Yours faithfully,
Frank G. Holroyd.
To the Editor of Felix.
Sir,
It was with some surprise that I read the
first of your "Felix road tests".
I think i t would have been more appropriate
to commenoe such a series with the one and.only
'Boanerges'. Few, i f any, freshers probably know
of i t s existence and I am sure that a member of the
C. & G. Motor Club would have supplied the relevant
data.
'Indignant Guildsman'.
(It was felt that a road-test on 'Bo' just
now would be a l i t t l e unfair as she is in
bits with seized bearings and a cracked
cylinder head! - Ed.)
