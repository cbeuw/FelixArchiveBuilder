Since beginning of term great a c t i v i t y could
be seen at the s a i l i n g grounds - one F i r e f l y has
been completely revarnished and the other w i l l be
started on soon. The hack dinghy "Impshee" i s at
last able to s a i l thanks to 9 months "hard labour"
(not to be confused with magistrates' sentence)
and i s f o r the use of a l l beginners - especially
a l l day on Sundays.
A number of talks by emminent yachtsmen are
being arranged, the next one being on Tuesday,Nov.
21st, when Capt. Ryder V.G., M.P. w i l l talk about
some of his many s a i l i n g experiences including the
s a i l i n g of the Tai-Mo-3han from China to England
and as commander of the "Campeltown" which rammed
the St. Nazaire dock i n 1942.
HOCKEY
The loss of Players to the university t r i a l s
had i t s effect on Club play during the f i r s t few
f i x t u r e s , but the teams are now showing some signs
of order. A weakened f i r s t XI which played against
King's College and o l d Dunstablians displayed lit&e
of the teamwork and guile of o l d , and i n particular
the drawn game against King's i s best forgotten.
However, with a f u l l team out against Reading Uni-
versity (save the loss of P. Juste sen and Ted Green
to U.L.H.C.) an extremely keen and clean game re-
sulted on a l i v e l y pitch. Improved combination i n
attack and steadiness i n defence were evident i n
the _IC team and only a firm Reading defenoe kept
the"score down to one goal.
"Uncle kac" i s busy training h i 3 new recruits
in the second XI and the performance of his team
against Old Dunstablians augurs well f o r the Club's
good reputation. This game was rather unfortunately
lost following a penalty bully.
The third and fourth teams have put up good
performances i n spite of the progressive effects of
team changes i n the higher orders. I t should be
stated however that the continuance of the fourth
XI i s dependent on consistent support from Club
members who should think of this before crossing
off f o r any game.
THE SABIN TANKARD
Saturday afternoon at Putney brought that cold
grey autumn weather, when oarsmen would much rather
huddle close to the f i r e and glance through "Ken
Only", than get soaked by a high tide. Further ap-
prehension was caused among the Sabin crew by the
fact that the oarsman at 4 had to drop out at the
last moment. In consequence, when 6'2" of Peter
Sharpe ( C&G ) turned up to work off the effects of
the previous evening with a l i t t l e gentlemanly ex-
ercise, he was promptly ordered into the crew to
make up the numbers.
Four VIII's were entered f o r this regatta,
which gave us one heat and the f i n a l . The toughest
opposition was King's College, which our crew had
drawn i n their f i r s t heat. This gave them no chance
of at; aasy race i n which to acclimatise the substi-
tute, and i n fact i t turned out to be even closer
than anticipated.
From the start at Crabtree Wharf the two crews
went off dead l e v e l , but whereas King's soon
lengthed out, IC seemed unable to settle down and
struck a higher rating over the whole course. For
more than half a mile each crew struggled to get
ahead, but neither could lead by more than a few
feet nor hold even that f o r long. They rounded the
Fulham bend s t i l l level,with King's i n the better
water, and then both VIII's spurted. Hugh Metcalfe
at stroke r a l l i e d his crew well and more by guts
than style they took half a length off their oppo-
nents before the f i n i s h .
In the f i n a l we met Vesta Rowing Club. Our
crew, rowing much more steadily than i n their f i r s t
race, were able to draw away from their r i v a l s and
with the help of clever coxing by "Taffy" Thomas,
they won by a length "and so retained the Sabin
Tankard f o r the third consecutive year. W
e have now
won this event five times out of the l a s t . s i x oc-
