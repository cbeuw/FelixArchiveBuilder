T
here are not many bands
in the world that can play a
three-hour live set and still
leave me wanting more, but
for Green Day I make an exception.
Whatever else is said about them,
there’s no denying one thing - these
guys can put on one hell of a show.
There are a number of things that
happen at a Green Day concert that
don’t happen at your average gig. For
example, when was the last time you
saw a small child from the audience be
a fake ‘sacrifice’ on stage? Or when did
you last see a lead singer pick up a hose
and drench the crowd in what I can
only hope was water? Then there was
the merchandise gun, shooting band
T-shirts into the crowd, and the relent-
less ‘Hey-Ho’-ing Billie Joe insisted on
every time he suspected the crowd of
becoming idle. Heck, there were even
mass singalongs of anything from the
Stones’ ‘I Can’t Get No Satisfaction’
to the Jackson 5’s ‘I’ll Be There’, where
Billie Joe started the crowd off, then
listened as all of the O2 arena sang
(surprisingly in-tune) until we could
no longer remember the lyrics.
But my favourite by far was when
the band allowed random audience
members onto the stage to take Mr
Armstrong’s place as lead singer dur-
ing various songs. Though none had
what you would call the ‘X-Factor’ it
was all very entertaining in a cringey
kind of way. The band played a 28
song set, including pretty much all
their hits, old and new, and I was
pleasantly surprised to find that
songs from their latest album (‘21st
Century Breakdown’) sounded even
Green Day @ The O2 Arena
better live than on record. I did,
however, get the distinct impression
that the band chose to get all of their
‘must do’ songs out of the way as
quickly as possible (excepting those
saved for the two encores), to then
have the freedom of pissing around
for the next hour and half. Whilst it
was all very entertaining, I did find
my attention wandering at times,
wishing that they would focus more
on their music and less on playing
with the crowd.

004 may be seen as a year of
innovation in hip-hop; Out-
kast released ‘Speakerboxxx/
The Love Below’ and Kanye
West released ‘The College
Drop Out’, both albums effectively
combining commercial success with
musical progression.
Made up of two of the most eccen-
tric heavy hitters of the hip hop under-
ground, Madlib and MF Doom, Mad-
villain surfaced from underground to
gain massive critical success from the
likes of the New York Times - a rare
event for a rap group. Although not as
widely noted as those two aforemen-
tioned albums, Madvillian give an-
other perspective on the evolution of
rap music, their view of how it should
have evolved. Self-defeating wit in-
stead of self-affirming posturing,
quirky samples and jazz beats instead
of pop hooks and 808 kicks.
MF Doom is arguably the most
interesting man in hip-hop. British
born, New York raised, he first ap-
peared aged 19 in early-nineties rap
group KMD. After gaining moder-
ate success KMD were dropped from
their record label, for their sophomore
album ‘Black Bastards’ being too con-
troversial. In the same week Doom’s
bandmate and brother died in a car
crash. Doom, disillusioned, withdrew
Albums that you should know
from rap, living near-homeless on the
streets of NYC. He appeared years
later as an underground mc. with a
metal mask and a host of alternate
personas ranging from a space alien
to a ‘Vaudeville Villain.’
It’s Doom’s rap style that is most
arresting to a first time listener - he
raps as if trying to crowbar all his wit
and wisdom into the spaces between
the kick and the snare, all whilst re-
taining his laid-back cool. Combined
with Madlib’s esoteric yet funky
beats the effect is fascinating. Lyrical
themes are varied, and include MF
Doom’s annoyance at how his named
is spelt ‘All Caps’, and the self-explan-

atory ‘America’s Most Blunted’. The
song ‘Fancy Clown’ features a cameo
from one of Doom’s alter egos; com-
plaining about his girl cheating with
another of his alter egos ‘Don’t make
me have to pound his tin crown face
in’. This shows a level of self-aware-
ness rare in hip-hop.
Averaging at just less than 2 minutes
per song, ‘Madvillainy’ is a focused al-
bum that incorporates a multitude of
different ideas that make it difficult to
consider the album a whole, let alone
describe it in 400 words. At the time
of writing, ‘Madvillainy 2’ is set for an
early 2010 release, and in today’s rap
world of ‘auto-tune vs. death of auto-
tune’ bullshit we need another dose of
the villain with ‘more soul than a sock
with a hole’.
