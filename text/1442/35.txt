Aunty McPickle says “get yourself a dashing merkin!“
Dear Aunty McPickle,
After attending a “savage” afternoon
of extreme Frisbee, I needed the
loo but felt my bowls cringe think-
ing of Hyde Park toilets. I decided
to make a run for home in the hon-
est belief I could make it. However
I had barley reached Gloucester Rd
when I realized the over estimation
of my bladder capacity and dashed
for the nearest cafe. The cafe was
packed and already sporting a queue
so I desperately opted for Starbucks.
On arrival I was horrified at the loo
being occupied, so tried pacing, sit-
ting anything to stop the inevitable
flow. The person inside was taking
a ridiculous amount of time and I
could feel the pressure surmount-
ing to near threshold level. Then, a
hideous relief came, as I finally gave
up and allowed Niagra to fall, leav-
ing a shameful puddle at my trainer
clad feet. I left, head down hoping
to avoid eye contact but I’m sure I
was noticed. I am now forced back
to this same Starbucks by a friend
and am sure the staff have all heard
about my accident. What can I do?
Sandy Sandra
Hi Sandra,
Oh dear, sounds like a terrible episode.
Be warned any enlightened friends
will probably take some enjoyment in
this but may stop forcing you back to
the scene. There are two Starbucks on
Gloucester Rd so why not try to per-
suade your friend to frequent the alter-
native one. Good luck,
Yours, Aunty McPickle xxx
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have recently just shaved one side
of my head and later on that night
whilst going down on my girlfriend i
noticed she had an excessive amount
of pubic hair. Mid oral sex I noticed
that the hair was the exact shade as
my hair and that she had somehow
managed to ligate my hair with her
bush. It freaked me out and I had
to stop. I’d really appreciate your
advice on how to deal with the situ-
ation, I think it will effect every as-
pect of our relationship.
Many Thanks,
Edge
Dear Edge,
This seems like a very bizarre situation,
did she notice your realization? It re-
minds me of a Inbetweeners episode. You
could either go with it and maybe buy her
dashing ‘merkin’; a toupee for the pubic
area. However if this all repulses you too
much, I think you have valid reasons to
dump her. Hope you sort it out

Dear Aunty McPickle,
I have an almost unheard of problem
down below. I seem to have been
blessed with a lot of freckles on my
clit. They seem to be more and more
every day and some are now border
line mole.
Are there any cures for this? Also
how should I present my problems
to boy friend?

Now that we have filled a coach of
willing RAGgers to get LOST some-
where in the UK, I’ll chat a little about
our chosen charity for this event. ALL
profits through sponsorship will go to
supporting their worthy cause.
Each year RAG picks a handful of
charities, which our main support
through collections goes to. This week
I would like to introduce you to Bar-
nardo’s, a charity which Imperial RAG
has supported for the last couple of
years.
This wonderful charity was founded
in 1866 by Thomas Barnardo in re-
sponse to the child poverty he wit-
nessed when he came to London. It
was in 1867 that he set up the Rag-
ged School and starting helping the
abused, vulnerable, forgotten and ne-
glected children of East London and
his work still continues today.
Today, Barnardo’s helps over 110,000
children, young people and their fami-
lies every year. Like Thomas Barnardo,
Barnardo’s believe that every child
deserves the best start in life and the
chance to fulfill their potential, regard-
less of their circumstances, gender,
race, disability or behaviour.
They use the knowledge gained from
their direct work with children to cam-
paign for better childcare policy and to
champion the rights of every child.
“With the right help, committed sup-
port and a little belief, even the most
vulnerable children can turn their lives
around.“
Barnardo’s is regulated by the Char-
ity Commission. Being a registered
charity means that they must always be
accountable and transparent.”

Hi Pam,
Have you been sunbathing naked a lot?
Make sure this doesn’t get out socially
as this rep will do you no favours. You
should definitely get this checked out by
a GP asap!
Best wishes, Aunty McPickle xxx
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I was recently attending a friend’s
dinner party. The evening seemed
to be going well and I was making
the usual supreme impression,
until to my great dismay, the friend
let a silent bomb rip. I was given
accusatory looks from the entire
table! I couldn’t exactly blame the
hospitable friend in question and so
humbly but weakly denied it. Now I
fear my name is forever tarnished in
the house hold.
Handy Harry
Dear Harry,
You should have denied more
vehemently and you would never be
faced with this shame.How about
inviting her to dinner at yours and
then playing the same trick!
Yours, Aunty McPickle xxx
