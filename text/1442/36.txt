With the BNP currently dominating
the media, it seems only appropriate
to provide a comprehensive guide on
what you’re legally allowed to say, think
and do.
Race
As a student of such a culturally rich
university, it is imperative that you
understand the many pitfalls that may
befoul you
Racism was made illegal by the gov-
ernment in 2007, but many people are
still unclear as to what racism actually
entails.
Tip 1 - If the first thing you notice
about someone is the colour of their
skin, you are a racist. You must train
yourself to first identify other universal
features, such as eye colour or clothing.
Try to act surprised if they tell you
that they are of a different ethnicity to
you. This tells them that you hold no
prejudice and only judge people by the
clothes they wear.
Avoid ruining your cool new image with an untimely and unwanted social faux pas.

Tip 2 - Avoid those naughty words!
Before you become the next Anton Du
Beke, make sure you’re well-equipped
with the latest ‘ok’ terminology.
Keep a diary of taboo words and try
out some new ones for yourself. Whilst
this may seem counter-intuitive, you
will reap the long-term benefits. I re-
cently called a good Chinese friend
of mine ‘captain chopsticks’. He is no
longer a good friend of mine.
Tip 3 - Don’t hold racial stereotypes.
If you’re sitting on the tube, nervously
staring at the angry-looking Middle-
Eastern man across from you, don’t
move to another seat. Instead, kindly
ask him to stop playing with his shoes
and ask politely if you can inspect the
contents of his backpack. You are look-
ing for any suspicious looking items,
such as wires or AK-47s.
IMPORTANT: To ensure that you
cause no offense, repeat this proc-
ess with every other person on the
carriage.
Tip 4 - If, after following tips 1 to 3,
you still unsure if you’re racist, here is
a quick scientific test:
10 Reasons to LOVE the Rugby Team
If you spotted a difference, you are still
racist. Hangman’s advice is to avoid
being around people of a different eth-
nicity to that of your own.
Gender
It’s a constant talk-point riddled with
common misconceptions. Hangman is
here to separate fact from fiction and
educate you on the mysteries of the
opposite sex.
Tip 1 - The first obvious step is to
identify your own gender. Before you
take a peek, there is a much quicker,
NHS-approved, gender test below.
Do you enjoy ‘The Notebook’?

DISCLAIMER
If you answered YES, you are a girl.
If you answered NO or ‘What the fuck
is the Notebook?’ Then you are a boy.
What exactly is Sexism?
The Oxford Dictionary Definition:
“noun - prejudice, stereotyping, or dis-
crimination, typically against women,
on the basis of sex.”
The key phrase here is, ‘typically
against women,’ which implies that
men are more sexist than women. The
Oxford Dictionary is therefore sexist
towards men. We suggest you find a
new dictionary guys!
Tip 2 - ‘A woman’s place is in the
kitchen’ This once-popular phrase has
now fallen out of favour with society so
you must take steps to avoid making
similar sexist stereotypes. As a male
you must now take it upon yourself to
cook, clean, wash up, shop, feed the
children, talk over films and take two
hours to park the car.
Tip 3- It is wrong to say that women
are mentally inferior to men. It is much
better to just think it.
Tip 4 - Don’t listen to feminists
Femisists are striving for equality, but
believe that women will always be infe-
rior to men. If men view themselves as
superior to women and feminists view
themselves as inferior to men, they are
both thinking exactly the same thing
and therefore they have equal views
and opinions. What more do they
want?
Weight
Fat people: Fatties, elephants, chunk-
sters, porkies, bean bags, lardy legs, scale
breakers, cakies, waddlers, celery-dodg-
ers, fridge raiders, big apples, hippos,
bed breakers, flabby wobbly bobs. These
are just a few of the clinical terms that
you can use to describe obese people.
Tip 1 - Hangman does not believe that
weight is an issue. You’re fat because you
eat too much. Calories in greater than
calories out. That’s science you fat twat!
Tip 2 - Don’t befriend fat people. You
will then be known as ‘that fat person’s
friend’
. Leave them alone. Hopefully
they’ll starve themselves from depres-
sion, or conversely binge themselves to
death. Happy times.
If you have been affected by any of the
issues raised in this issue of Hangman,

ever use reliable sources and provide you
with hard fact.
