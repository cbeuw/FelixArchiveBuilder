Chorizo-scopes! Horoscopes: now smelly and Spanish
There are 12,000 people at this university. So by calculation, 1,000 of you will have the same horrible week
Cancer
“Oi mate! If y’ dunt tek
yer eyes off me bird,
im gonna knock ya
fucking kite off. I aren’t
joking mate, dunt
mek like ya dint hear
owt, I’ll fucking bray ya one. I’ll giv ya summat
to remember her face by...” That’s probably the
warmest welcome you will get if you go to the
North. So stop making fun of our accents and
stay the fuck out of Yorkshire you southern cunts!
Virgo
Well, looks like you’re
going to have to discard
those pants. You’ve got
several options. The
funniest of them being;
1. you sit in the cubicles
and chew your pants until you evolve the ability to
digest cotton. 2. you wear them, and grind every
bloke in the club, and be fucking proud of your
self-urinated state. Some of the men may even like
it. 3. You decide you might as well shit yourself too.
Gemini
You’re going to be
a man soon son.
Gonna have to start
thinkin’ about the
future son. Get a job
and raise a family
son. Ok Dad, don’t worry, I’ve got everything
sorted: dungeon built? Check. Sister kidnapped
and impregnated? Check. Now just sit back and
wait 13 years until your daughter/sister is old
enough for some fresh tight clunge.
Pisces
Your penis came away
in the boy’s arse and
the donkey rode you
so hard its furry thing
came through your
stomach. Get up you
Zulu Warrior and stick a plaster on! Improvise for
a new penis, a wooden pole or a vibrator should
slot in nicely. Now where’s the lion enclosure? You
know you can’t resist the attraction of some tooth
and claw action...
Leo
This week you’re un-
deservedly climbing up
society’s ladder. Well,
la-di-dah. Look at you
in your private room
that Mayfair club.
The staff see you for the Sarrrrf-London girl you
are and serve you plenty of anti-diuretics. Before
you know it, you’re hugging the big lesbian toilet
attendant in shame after she’s mopped up all your
piss off the floor. You pissed yourself, mate. Fail.
Aries
You picked the mean-
est bad assed looking
lion and pounced on it
from behind. Problem
is, he rather enjoyed
too much. Now he
wants to move in, take your relationship to the
next level. At least you get some attention when
you ride him to GAY Late. “My boyfriend is a
fucking LION!”
. He’s talking about adoption now;
he wants two blacks and a Chinese one. Fail
Scorpio
Oh My God you fat
bitch, take a look at
yourself in the mirror.
My eyes are so offended
by your appearence
they’re going jump out
and buy a ticket to Switzerland. I have to avoid your
enormous thighs in fear of being absorbed into
your numerous layers of cellulite. You’re beyond
dieting, throw your obese body into the Serpentine
so I’ll never gaze upon your hideous face again!
Libra
Oh, so you went with
No.3? Why’d you do
that, you fucking idiot?
Well, there you are,
sitting in a Mayfair
Club, pissy and shitty?
Whatya gonna do now? That’s right. Hold your
head up, and have your period there and then
too. Wow. You better hope the next person
that see’s you has just wandered out the nearest
Perverts and Fetish Anonymous meeting.
Taurus
SICKTINGS BRUVS.
YOU IZ NOT
GUNNA FUCKING
GUESS WOT JUST
HAPPENED? Well, I
went to the takeaway
and ordered No. 45, as usual. Then my racist
streak came over me, and I set fire to the
Chinese bloke and the rest of his family round
the back. You’re going to be convicted for
racially motivated arson. Sucks to be you, son.
Capricorn
You’ve got new trainers.
You love them so much,
you’re ready to have
wild rampant sex with
them. In fact, they were
a bit cummy already, but
you can’t blame anyone for not resisting. Yes, you
can. You run some genetic tests from the semen
samples you’ve found on the insole. Turns out it’s
your semen, and that you’re actually having your
firstborn with Nike Hi-Dunks. Shitsticks. Pint?
Aquarius
After last week’s
exploits, the doctor
tried to reattach your
butchered penis.
However he gave up
half way after you
tried to rape him. It’s horribly crooked and is
constantly seeping blood and pus but still func-
tioning. Any new ideas? How about abducting
a child and taking him to a petting zoo, there
you can spit roast him with a donkey.

Sagittarius
So you’re sitting there
comfortably, and well,
Michael Buble’s playing
in the background.
That’s fine. Your mum
listens to Michael Buble
in the car. It reminds you of being home. Then you
overhear people talking about reusable tampons.
‘Mooncups’ they call them. Then you wonder if
your mum uses these mooncups. It would explain
the “messy fingers” thing she keeps mentioning.
