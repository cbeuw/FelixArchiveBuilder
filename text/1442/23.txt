knee-high socks/legwarmers. How-
ever as we are in the city I would ad-
vise foregoing the wellington boots
in favour of some flat ankle boots to
preserve the comfort factor whilst still
toughening the florals.
This Mitford-esque manner of dress-
ing is not only being seen on the big
screen. Not since the Eighties’ Sloane
Rangers has country style been so in
vogue amongst Londoners- particu-
larly the capital’s youth who seem to
have grown bored with urban neons
and bodycon and are looking for a little
farmhouse comfort in the form of dull
colours and warm fabrics. East London
is teeming with Barbour jackets, wool
trousers, tweed and the ubiquitous
Fair Isle knit (aka. Grandad) jumpers.
On the catwalk the theme was
refreshed by Luella’s super comfy
wide-legged Oxford Bags, Burberry’s
tweed cape – a novel change from the
standard winter coat, Peter Jensen’s
houndstooth print splashed over his
collection in a decidedly non-herit-
age way and Matthew Williamson’s
Fair Isle coat and dress combination
which quite thouroughly nullifies the
aforemen- tioned “grandad”
associa- tion.
When it
I
f anyone has seen the Edge of
Love (a biopic of Welsh poet
Dylan Thomas, starring Kiera
Knightley and Sienna Miller)
you will undoubtedly agree that
the film itself is nothing to rave about.
However I am still awe-struck by the
way the costumes have such incred-
ible style and flair without seeming to
try at all. Perhaps it is the actresses’ ir-
refutable beauty and sylphlike figures
that pull it together, or maybe the
reason for this ostensibly unintend-
ed charm is the fact that they are
draped simultaneously in carefree
prettiness and complete practical-
ity. Made for the cold, wet Welsh
countryside during wartime, it
is the perfect style to emulate
for us here in England as the
bleaker months approach.
The ensembles comprise of
floral tea dresses, thick knit
jumpers and woollen socks.
The complete effect brings
to mind cold, rainy after-
noon walks, wind blown
hair and hot chocolate
when you get home.
High street shops such
as Topshop and H&M
have a great selection
of floral dresses and
skirts. Jumper-wise,
choose cable knits in
autumnal colours such as burgundy,
charcoal, berry, mustard or brown and

ome people like to be a walk-
ing tweet, look at the many
celebrities’ statement mak-
ing t-shirts, Paris Hilton’s
“I love my pink life” or Ma-
donna’s “Kabbalists do it better”. Some
of you, who rise above the common
pop culture, may find it a mission to
hunt down a t-shirt that lets you wear
your inspirational figure close to your
heart. A new t-shirt company Heretics
is your solution to just that. Frown no
more; Confucius is here, his spirit for-
ever inscribed on a t-shirt.
A design trio (they call themselves
the Evangelists, with a capital E), Jason,
Anthony and a Spanish painter who
wishes to remain anonymous, believe
that t-shirts have become too loud,
colourful and meaningless. “What
you wear is the clearest illustration of
who you are and what you believe in.
We also want to celebrate the purvey-
ors and architects of modern art and
culture.”
And Heretics is born, Jason and
Anthony commissioned the Spanish
painter to illustrate those artists who
challenged conventional thinking and
expanded the realm of art. From the
many great artists that the painter has
catalogued over the years, he moved
on to create caricatures of these think-
ers and icons.
These caricatures capture the es-
sence of the protagonists with their
career defining works, for example,
Warhol in his Campbell’s soup and
Shakespeare with “to be or not to be
that is the question” written across his
forehead. The design trio does rigor-
ous research in order to understand
the protagonists.
Out of the over 300 designs, the
Evangelist’s favourite piece is Capa.
Capa was the first reality photojour-
nalist. Capa documented the Spanish
Civil war and WWII from the front
lines. Fearlessly, he died with a cam-
era in his hand after stepping on a

Here’s a short interview with the
Chief Evangelist, Jason:
How come there are so little
sketches that featured people who
are still alive?
We looked for artisans who tran-
scended generations, heretics which
shifted paradigms, who were so far
ahead of the pack that even their peers
misunderstood them. (“I wish they
would only take me as I am.” Vincent
van Gogh) Those alive today are too
young (in art terms) to have had such
an impact. But like Sir Norman Foster
who demands a mention, they are in-
cluded. We welcome suggestions and
are adding artists on an ongoing basis.
We have an amazing Michael Jackson
caricature which we have yet to release.
Have you contacted any celebrities
and offered them t-shirts?
We are not ready to whore ourselves
to them anytime soon. We prefer to
create a ground swell. So we are work-
ing through universities, arts and cul-
tural institutions. This is the thinking
person’s t-shirt. Let the celebrities dis-
cover us like everybody else.
Will you consider drawing Boris?
Obama? John Cleese? How will your
categories expand in the future?
How about models, politicians?
What about non-portrait stuff?
Cheese, shoes etc?
No. They haven’t actually achieved
anything yet (even Obama), when they
do something of magnitude then may-
be. Heretics is all about artisans. We
are more likely to include, Stalin, Cas-
tro, Che Guevara, Hawkins, Jesus and
Chairman Mao type heavy weights.
But as we evolve, we could expand to
titans of Business, Politics or Science.
Heretics has offered 2 lucky readers a
chance to win a t-shirt of their choice.

brogues are the order
of the day for both men

course, none of this must
be worn with any degree
of grooming or neatness.
It’s all part of the charm.
