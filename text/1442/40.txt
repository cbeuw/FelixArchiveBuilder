2009 marks the début of Imperial
College Baseball Club. After a mere
3 weeks of training sessions, we set a
roster of 15 players to participate in the
British University Baseball Association
(BUBA) Fall Shield - a tournament de-
signed for the four new entrants to the
league, contested on the weekend of
the 24th and 25th of October.
Leaving the Union in the early hours
of Saturday morning, we arrived in
time for our first-ever competitive
match against the Lincoln Common-
ers. Behind a dominant pitching per-
formance by Hanson Cheung, the
Imperial Falcons took an early lead
and held on despite the wet and windy
conditions, as well as several defensive
miscues, going on to win the game
12-7.
The Brighton Panthers failed to ar-
rive in time for their first match, caus-
ing them to be disqualified. This al-
lowed the final to be brought forward
to Saturday evening, creating the op-
portunity for whoever was to win the
Shield to play a friendly against Not-
tingham on Sunday morning.
The Falcons advanced to the final
where we once against faced Lin-
coln. However this time, Hanson was
not available to pitch, having already
thrown too many innings. YY Chen
gamely stepped up to pitch his first
ever baseball match.
After allowing the first 5 batters to
reach base, leading to four runs in the
first innings, he settled down, allowing
Imperial to storm back in the bottom
of the first innings, striking for 12 runs
on 6 hits, gaining a lead they would

1sts on Cloud 9 After
Dispatching Medics
The 1st XI went into Wednesday’s
BUCS Cup 1st Round with the hopes
of beginning what is hoped to be a de-
cent cup run. With the Imperial Col-
lege Medicals 2nd XI the opponents,
this was a chance for College to put
their hard work in training to good use.
Most College vs. Medicals ties are
fiercely fought but within 5 minutes
College broke the deadlock with fresh-
er Nathan Ferrol calmly finishing a
header into the box by strike partner
Leslie Eshun.
College kept up the pressure and
within the next 10 minutes Eshun
latched onto a Sam Rickards overhead
kicked cross to make it 2-0. Ferrol
made it 3-0 at the 25 minute mark after
heading in an excellent cross by right-
winger Will Swain. Swain matched his
assist finishing off a well-worked team
goal starting from defence and with
quality play from the left sided duo of
Matthieu Vallin and Haris Tofis.
Though the game was won at this
point, College still had to battle against
an ever resilient Medicals side and just
before the half time whistle, Romain
Chauvet laid it off to Eshun who un-
leashed a 22-yard drilled effort which
beat the opposing goalkeeper.
The half time talk by captain Mus-
tapher Botchway stressed the point
of avoiding complacency at all costs.
Swain correctly added “a 5-0 win is a
better result a 10-2 victory.”
Botchway decided to capitalise
on the domination of possession by
switching formation to 3-5-2, where-
