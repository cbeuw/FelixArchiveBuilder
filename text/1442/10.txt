‘Holy grail’ of cancer therapy found
According to the co-author of a recent
study published by a team of research-
ers at the University of Pittsburgh, Jeff
Isenberg: “More than half of all cancer
patients are treated at least in part with
radiation”.
Radiotherapy is the use of ionising
radiation as part of cancer treatment
to control malignant cells. It can be
used as palliative treatment (where
a cure is not possible and the aim is
for local control or relief) or as thera-
peutic treatment (where the therapy
has survival benefit and it may be
curative). It is used in the treatment
of malignant tumours where it acts
as the primary therapy, but also com-
monly in combination with surgery,
chemotherapy, hormone therapy or
transplantation.
Fundamentally, it is the vital proc-
ess in the initial destruction of cancer
cells in the short term. However, at the
moment there are problems in that al-
though radiation may be physically di-
rected as precisely as possible, it does
not differentiate between healthy and
cancerous cells. This causes problems
such as nausea, vomiting, skin sores,
rashes, weakness and fatigue as well as
harsher side effects caused by longer
term radiation such as scarring, and
furthermore death of normal tissue.
This problem has made the need for
a resolution clear and obvious. Lucky
now then, that the team from the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in conjunction
with the NCI (National Cancer Insti-
tute) claim to have found a way to both
protect healthy tissue from the toxic
effects of radiation treatment, and at
the same time increase tumour death.
They claim to have identified a bio-
chemical signalling pathway that can
profoundly influence what happens
to both cancerous and healthy cells
when they are exposed to radiation. In
mouse experiments, they found that
blocking the molecule thrombospon-
din-1 (TSP1) from binding to its cell
surface receptor CD47 (Cluster of
Differentiation 47) affords normal tis-
sues almost complete protection from
both standard and very high doses of
radiation.
Senior author Dr David Roberts from
the NCI stated that despite protecting
healthy cells, the new approach does
not provide this same level of protec-
tion to cancer cells. However, the exact
way in which normal cells are protect-
ed when the TSP1/CD47 cell signalling
pathway is disrupted is not yet clear.
“We almost couldn’t believe what
we were seeing,” Dr Jeff Isenberg, the
chief author, said. “This dramatic pro-
tective effect occurred in skin, muscle
and bone marrow cells, which is very
encouraging”. He added “Cells that
might have died of radiation exposure
remained viable and functional when
pre-treated with agents that interfere
with the TSP1/CD47 pathway.”
Dr David Roberts explained, “In our
experiments, suppression of CD47
robustly delayed the regrowth of tu-
mours in radiation-treated mice.” Dr
Isenberg, who published his findings
in the journal Science Translational
Medicine, said the treatment should
be transferable to humans in as little
as five years: “The therapeutic agents
have been tested in normal cells from
A new finding at the University of Pittsburgh offers a therapeutic hope to millions, up to a point
mice, rats, pigs and cows and in living
animals including mice, rats and pigs.
“However, further optimisation and
testing of these agents would be re-
quired prior to any usage in humans.”
He claimed that the drugs had been
effective on human cells in the labo-
ratory but that toxicology and clinical
trials would be needed before it could
potentially be adopted as a treatment, a
process which could require up to five
years.
Dr Ester Hammond, a Cancer Re-
search UK scientist at the University
of Oxford, commented: “This work is
particularly exciting because it’s a step
towards developing drugs that could
be given alongside radiotherapy to pro-
tect healthy cells, while destroying the
cancerous ones.”
But, as previously mentioned, the
study raises the intriguing question of
exactly why normal cells are protected
from radiation when this particular
cell-signalling pathway is disrupted.
It is possible that the radiation im-
pairs the immune response to tumours
even while killing tumour cells, but
suppression of CD47 keeps the im-
mune cells safe. Decreasing CD47 lev-
els on tumour cells also could make
them more sensitive to attack by the
patient’s immune system after treat-
ment. Or, suppression of injury to
vascular cells may have the ability to
improve blood flow allowing naturally
occurring anti-tumour immunity to
reach cancer cells more easily
“Future work will undoubtedly shed
more light on this and could lead to
new treatments for cancer patients,”
Dr Hammond added.
So called ‘miracle drugs’ reported

on tumours we are doing nothing to
allay the causes of cancer, nor to ad-
dress the underlying fundamental
problems that remain within the body

potential to repeatedly create the

such as the chromosomal transloca-

(take the example of the curry ingre-

result we should be cautious. Even in
the best-case scenario that the expres-
sion of CD47 can become routinely
reduced by the action of a drug and it
has the desired effect, it would hardly
be the end of cancer. By reducing the

The secondary structures of CD47, in all their colourful glory
A little over a year ago, the world
looked to CERN with baited breath
for the switch-on many feared would
spell the end of the universe. The
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was set
to recreate conditions at the start of
the universe and continue the hunt for
the ever-elusive Higgs boson. How-
ever, despite the great build-up, the
start of the experiment was notably
lacking in dramatics. The big moment
was marked only by a smattering of ap-
plause among the scientists at CERN,
and almost missed entirely by the live
BBC reporter!
Unfortunately, the experiment was
called to an end before it even fully
began. The LHC was shut down barely
nine days after the initial start-up. A
faulty electrical connection caused
a tonne of liquid helium to leak into
the tunnel from two superconducting
magnets. This ‘quenching’ raised the
temperature of the magnets by over
100K above the required 1.9K and has
taken scientists and engineers a year to
repair.
Last Friday marked the first injection
of particles into the collider since last
year’s setback. Beams of protons and
lead ions were sent clockwise around
part of the ‘A Large Ion Collider Exper-
iment’ (ALICE), a 7 km part of the larg-
er LHC experiment. Protons were also
fired anticlockwise through the LHCb
detector, a part of the LHC designed
to investigate the abundance of matter
relative to the amount of antimatter in
the universe.
This may seem like a very small step
in the restarting of the experiment
but engineers and scientists are wary
of a repeat catastrophe and are taking
things one stage at a time. The beams
sent around the LHC have shown that
the collider’s systems are now work-
ing as they should be. The process of
testing the collider section-by-section
is slow but necessary to perform the
calibrations required for the smooth
running of the experiment.
Gianluigi Arduini told BBC News:
‘This is a work of synchronisation.
The fast magnets must be synchro-
nised to accelerate the beam and
transfer it from one accelerator to
the next and eventually to the LHC,
which must be synchronised to ac-
cept it.’
For the time being, the protons and
ions are being introduced to the col-
lider at the relatively low energy of 450
million electron volts. When the ex-
periment is fully running, the particle
beams will accelerate to and collide in

low the speed of light. The energy of
the particles is to be built up in stages
with the hope that beams will be ac-
celerated up to 7 billion elecron volts
by 2011. At this energy, particle col-
lisions will give scientists insight into
the first moments after the creation
of the universe. Many involved in the
experiment also hope the end results
will provide concrete evidence for the
Higgs boson, a theoretical particle be-
lieved to give other particles mass.
Holger Bech Nielsen of the Niels
Bohr Institute, Copenhagen remarked
that breakdowns at the LHC may be
caused by the Higgs boson itself. Theo-
retically the boson could go back in
time and destroy whatever created it,
leading to a malfunction in the accel-
erator. Contrary to this, most scientists
believe the 2008 failure was down to
more routine problems with the actual
apparatus.
The next step now will be the circu-
lation of a particle beam the full way
around the 27 km tunnel.
This is set to take place in November
this year.
