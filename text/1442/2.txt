Former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic fails to
appear at his war crimes tri-
al held in The Hague.
The genocide and war
crimes trial against Mr Kara-
dzic opened on Monday with
an empty chair where the ac-
cused should have been sit-
ting. Karadzic has denied
11 war crimes charges arising from the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the
1990s, in particular the 1992-95 Bosnian war, including two genocide charges
for the massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica.
Prosecutor Alan Tieger spent the first 12 minutes of his opening statements
describing how the “Supreme Commander” orchestrated ethnic cleansing
campaigns to eradicate Muslims from Bosnia. Mr Karadzic is boycotting the
proceedings because he says he needs more time to prepare for the trial. If he
again fails to appear in the courtroom at the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia, he risk having tried in absentia. Mr Karadzic was a
fugitive from 1996 until July 2008, when he was found as a practising doctor

Fast-food retailer McDonald’s
has announced its decision to
pull out of Iceland, following
the collapse of the country’s
economy earlier this year.
McDonalds blamed the
closure of the three restau-
rants on the island on the
“very challenging economic
climate” and the “unique op-
erational complexity” of doing business in an island nation of just
300,000 people on the edge of the Arctic Circle. Most ingredients
used in Iceland’s McDonalds were imported from Germany.
Following the collapse of the Icelandic krona, and the strengthen-
ing of the euro, burger prices would have to rise by 20% to ensure a
profit, making the Icelandic Big Mac the most expensive in the world.
Iceland will now join Albania, Armenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
in a small club of European countries without a McDonald’s.

Pope Benedict XVI, leader of the Catholic church, announced a plan last
week to allow Anglicans to convert to Catholicism en masse, creating a
new headache for the beleaguered Anglican leadership.
Seventeen years ago, the Church of England voted to admit women to the
priesthood, causing disenchanted individual members to convert to Roman
Catholicism. More recently, increasing tolerance of homosexuality in some
branches of the 80 million strong worldwide Anglican Communion, particu-
larly in the Episcopalian church in America which was the first to ordain an
openly gay bishop, has prompted larger numbers of conservatives to desert.
But many have been reluctant to leave their liturgy and heritage. Now, the
pope’s plan is to provide any splinter of the Anglicans – community, parish, or
even an entire diocese – to enter into communion with Rome as a whole, and
without sacrificing its traditions. The Roman Catholic church will make ex-
ception to its rule for priest celibacy, however it will not permit married bish-
ops. Already, several dozen rebel Anglican priests have joined the Vatican.

Lecturers to be voted for online
Election season is once again ap-
proaching. The wave of specific policy
proposals, usual around this time, is
now underway.
The Conservatives began with talk
of austerity as a big theme, which is to
include reduced subsidisation for uni-
versities. Shadow Universities Secre-
tary David Willetts is trying to justify
this by suggesting that his government
will help students get better value in
return for higher fees. He is working
with Microsoft on a new national web-
site where students can offer feedback
on the lecturing staff.
The website has been under devel-
opment for months now and aims to
build on the National Student Survey,
which asks final-year undergraduates
to rate the quality of teaching on their
course. It will be like Imperial’s SOLE
but government mandated instead
of voluntary and for every university
rather than those that want it. In fact,
it will be like a whole host of uni-
versity-rating websites that already
functioning effectively. The largest of
these is ratemyprofessors.com, which
rates lecturers on helpfulness, clar-
ity and hotness. (Imperial is known
to fare better on sites with different
criteria).
It is very difficult to see what this
will achieve, given the existing alter-
natives. It could be seen as an indica-
tion of a lack of fidelity to the Tories’
own claimed values of less intrusion
by the State and more responsibility
for individuals. One issue is personal
comments on staff, which the lectur-
ers’ unions have spinelessly objected to
rather than embrace as a way for supe-
rior teachers to be better recognised.

Sina Ataherian News Reporter University and College Union gen-
eral secretary Sally Hunt claims “All
staff and students have the right to
work free from intimidation, online
or otherwise…If students have real
concerns about their lecturers, they
should go through the proper chan-
nels.” This may be expected from a un-
ion representative, but it is surprising
to hear Mr Willetts say, “My view is
that we need more places for this kind
of information in a way that is properly
monitored.”
It would appear that these people
have forgotten about existing laws
against defamation, libel and slander.
Students already suffer from great
shortcomings in performing the nec-
essary research before deciding where
and what to study. Any attempt to cur-
tail and centralise websites that help
them with this important decision
should be opposed.
Students will be able to give feedback for their lecturers online; lectures in the morning, slagging off in the afternoon
