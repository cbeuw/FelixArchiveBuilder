Dell cuts Air in half
with the Adamo XPS
Simon Worthington reports on Dell’s new anorexic offering
Where are we
going Google?
T
his week has been all about
Android 2.0. Google was
definitely on a roll in the tech
sector this week with an of-
ficial video laying out the details of An-
droid 2.0. New to the little mean green
machine will be Quick Contact which
features integrated two way syncing
and amalgamation of contacts (similar
to Palm’s Synergy), which will pull in
contacts and information from mul-
tiple sources into one list. Improve-
ments to the general operation of the
system have also been made across the
board including Exchange support,
searchable SMS, full multitouch sup-
port and a revamped browser UI and
HTML5 support. Hardware support
has also be increased with Bluetooth
2.1 and multiple screen size support
including WVGA being rolled in.
Google is also introducing a free
turn-by-turn Sat Nav that it’s building
into its Google Maps application. Cur-
rently in beta, like all things Google, it
will be available on Android 2.0 from
the get go. Leveraging other Google
technology it’ll also feature vocal ad-
dress input and text to speech output,
so in effect you may end up having a
conversation with your phone over
where you’re going.
Google is also introducing what it
calls layers, which are basically over-
lays on the map that show pertinent
information. Both satellite and Street
View are layers, meaning that you can
get a good view of where you need to
turn and when you’re at your destina-
tion with image overlays. Helpful if
you’re going somewhere you’ve never
seen before. Traffic information will
also be available as a layer and will pull
data from local sources and from mo-
bile phones using Google Maps. This
means that anyone who’s stuck in traf-
fic and using Google Maps will act as
an early warning system for everyone
else using Google Maps in real-time.
Google also said that it is easy for them
to add extra layers and there’s always
the possibility Google might even open
up an API for 3rd party layers within
the app. I’m hoping that we’ll see the
integration of Google Latitude into the
app, which would be really useful if you
happen to be travelling in a convoy and
get separated.
Great but what happens if the signal
craps out on you and you’re lost? Well
thankfully Google’s thought of that and
made Maps cache the route before you
leave in an effort to alleviate this prob-
lem. Of course there’s also a benefit to
the streaming maps system and that’s
you’ll never have to update the maps
on your device.
Other platform specific announce-
ments are waiting on device manu-
facturers, but Google implied that it is
working closely with Apple so it may
appear on an iPhone near to you in the
not too distant future. Whatever hap-
pens with regard to cross-platform
availability, it’s sure put a dampener
on the likes of TomTom and Navigon
who have been pushing iPhone Sat Nav
apps for quite large sums of money.
When people are faced with £60 for
TomTom or a free Google Maps app,
supported by search money, that does
the same thing, I know which option
most are going to choose. The problem
I foresee here is that Google may end
up wiping out the competition for GPS
apps on connected devices. Without
competition it would mean we’d have
to wait for Google to innovate with-
out any real urgency for them to do so.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m stoked to see
what Google’s going to do with their
navigation app in the near future, but
I can’t help but think we’re all going to
end up losing out in the long run.

Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
Another week, another botch-up in-
volving Microsoft. This time it was the
UK unveiling of Sky’s VOD service Sky
Player for Xbox 360, which suffered a
failure to launch on Tuesday. Having
been suspended due to ‘an unforeseen
technical issue’ after being 6 months in
the pipeline, it was major egg on face
for both Microsoft and Sky. Sky hopes
to have the service up and running by
the end of the week but I wouldn’t hold
your breath on that one.
The Spawn HD-720, an ugly yet ex-
tremely functional box of tricks, is
capable of streaming your console of
choice onto your PC, allowing you to
play your console anywhere with an in-
ternet connection. The first test boxes
that have been making their way out
are LAN only but internet streaming
should be available soon. First impres-
sions are that it actually works. There
is a small lag making some control
schemes feel a little less precise but it’s
certainly a promising start. Imagine
playing your Xbox from College or in
the Airport waiting for a flight.
The US Army has been busy this
week too, with helmet mounted radar
helping soldiers see who’s creeping up
on them. Being able to see through
fog, dust and even walls and weighing
in at no more than 2.5 pounds the only
problem I can foresee is the bloody
obvious radar dish on their heads. I’m
assuming some miniaturization will be
put into practice here and if it saves
lives in a war zone, I’m all for it.
Android also got drafted into the
US military this week. Raytheon, the
weapons specialist, has developed a
new Android app called the Raytheon
Android Tactical System which allows
soldiers to track the positions of other
soldiers and UAVs. This allows soldiers
to get the tactical advantage of a UAV
POV sent straight to their connected
Android device. I’m doubting this’ll
make it’s way onto your HTC Hero
anytime soon, but it can only be good
news for Android fans having the US
military backing the mobile OS.
L
ast week we reported the re-
lease of Dell’s new ultrathin
Adamo XPS laptop, which,
according to the Internet,
was due for public consumption last
Thursday. Well, Thursday came and
went and unfortunately we’ve all been
duped as the XPS is very much not
available in shops. Don’t worry, we feel
violated too. What we can offer you in-
stead is a review of the latest info about
Dell’s size-zero laptop.
So here’s what we know. The XPS is
the latest model in Dell’s Adamo range
(the one they never properly show off
in announcements), which it claims
focuses on ‘design and mobility’. The
design is certainly something else, as
the laptop sports some interesting fea-
tures. To even get the lid open you’ll
need to make use of the heat-sensitive
strip which glows and unlocks the case
on contact with your fingers. That
said, it’s actually the only way to get
the thing open, so if the battery runs
out or you’ve just got poor circulation
you are essentially stuck with a useless
aluminium slab. Once you’ve tackled
this obstacle, you’ll find that the key-
board and screen are hinged not at the
bottom as is conventional, but more
towards the middle, which angles the
keyboard upwards. If you had this on
your lap you would think this might
put all the weight on one point and
make it uncomfortable, but it turns out
that’s not a problem. Oh, did I forget to
mention that it weighs just 0.68Kg (yes
that’s just 680 grams) and is 9.99mm
(less than a centimetre) thick?
If that last line is giving you déjà vu,
it’s because in reality the Adamo XPS
is Dell’s answer to Apple’s MacBook
Air, which was famously pulled out
of a manila envelope upon launch to
demonstrate its thinness. The Adamo
has slightly superior specs than the
current generation MacBook Air too,
with the option of 1.4 or 1.9GHz ULV
dual-core processors, up to 4GB of
RAM, integrated graphics powered by
an Intel X4500MHD and either a 128
or 180GB SSD, all stuffed in behind its
13.4” WXGA LED-backlit screen. On
paper the XPS certainly matches Ap-
ple’s latest generation Air in all but the
processor department, in which the
Air wields non-ULV Core 2 Duos. The
XPS certainly has the upper hand in size
however, as its tiny width and miniscule
weight are both less than half of the Air.
If only its price tag had a similar com-
parison, because the new Dell will set
you back an eye-watering $2,000 (for
a machine that gives you a weak 3.3 on
the Windows 7 experience index). This
really tends to throw everything into
perspective when you consider that for
the same money you could get the new
beefiest iMac money can buy, which
has many times the processing power
and disk space. So, what are we actu-
ally paying for? Clearly, Dell thinks that
what we are willing to pay for is the tiny
size and weight. But that leads me to my
next question: who cares?
The heat-sensitive strip, weird hing-
es and incredible thinness are all very
nice, but are they really anything more
than a few bangles and baubles cre-
ated to please the gadget loving crowd?
The specs aren’t bad for the size, but
there are plenty of slightly larger lap-
tops out there that deliver much better
performance. At the end of the day, the
Adamo XPS compromises power for
style and it’s up to consumers to de-
cide whether or not that’s something
they’re willing to shell out for. The
performance of the MacBook Air in
the market suggests that at least some
people are, but then Apple products
do tend to attract those who like their
gadgets to look nice. It will be interest-
ing to see whether Dell can replicate
the aesthetics-driven success that Ap-
ple saw with the Air.

SamuelGibbs Technology Editor February the Allerta inPulse Smart-
watch is equipped with a 1.3” OLED
screen and bluetooth to hook up to
your BlackBerry. It alerts you to new
messages through vibration and dis-
plays summary information right on
your wrist. At around £90 however,
unless you really dig the styling for use
as a normal watch, I think taking your
phone out of your pocket when you get
a message is more than doable.
A solution to that uniquely Face-
book problem of what happens when
someone on Facebook kicks the bucket
has now been solved with Facebook
‘Memorial Pages’. A member of the
deceased’s friends can send Facebook
proof of death after which Facebook
will lock the account, maintaining the
profile and allowing friends to post on
their wall. Creepy if you ask me.
Unlike Android, a BlackBerry is a
device associated with no-nonsense
business types (regardless of how hard
they advertise), so it’s strange to see a
3rd party accessory in the works that’s
frankly anything but. Launching in
