A
right? So last week you
may have noticed that
we were recruiting a
new puzzles bitch. Well
you’ll all be pleased
to know that not one, but two have
been tracked down for our personal
use. The names of these great people
are Sean Farres and Milli Begum so
let’s give them a big hand. I personally
would like to thank you both as with-
out you they wouldn’t get done, as you
saw last week. If any of you do feel the
need to complain about any of the stuff
on these pages, please feel free to fuck
right off. I’m not going to lie, I have
pretty much had it with people com-
ing up to me and telling me something
is shit. Well done pal, great input. You
think you can do better, or do you have
any ideas as to how we can improve
things? Or better still do you want to
come and help out? Oh you don’t do
you. Well, fuck off before I punch your
spine into a fine powder. It may sound
like I’m joking, but I invite you to push
me because, really I couldn’t give a shit.
This was particularly evident last
Wednesday night at ACC barnight
(which this year I do not run, so do
not come up to me at any point in the
evening ever again). Since when does
an intelligent person ask a question as
fucking retarded as ‘Where is all the
beer?” Mate, your a cunt. The beer is
where it always is, in the kegs. And
what’s more, the only way the beer will
get out of the kegs is through the taps.
So get in line, shut the fuck up and use
your common sense. Nobody is going
to come and run off with a keg, it’s al-
ways going to be there and it’s there to
be drunk. You twats.
Finally to continue my massive rant,
if I give you £10 and you lose it, I’m not
going to give you another. Neither will
your sister, mother or the dirty paedo-
phile who lives three doors down. If
you are stupid enough to lose it then
you should not be broadcasting your
stupidity to the masses really. If you re-
ally do feel the need to, do it preferably
by writing, then I have the opportunity
to completely ignore you and throw
you badly written ramblings of a sad
lonely person who pleasures them-
selves with a cucumber straight into
the bin. I think you catch my drift, if
not just come down to felix and ask for
a chat. I don’t recommend it though.
Stuff Imperial students like:
5. Bar nights:
Well last Wednesday was the first of
the infamous ACC Bar nights, and
what a good night! As I said at the
start of the year, I do love bit of “It’s
Raining Men” and I definitely had
my dancing shoes on. So much so
that I have taken myself to Hospital
with repetitive strain injuries. Not
really, but my foot is in PAIN!
But seriously, the idea of a bar
night is probably one of the best
that someone has ever had. Who
was sitting in the bar on night and
thought, “I know what this place
needs, beer. Not just a few more
pints, but, like 23 kegs. That should
do it. And what’s more, let’s make it
all you can drink. Actually, charge a
fiver and we’ll all be laughing.”
Whoever thought that is a genius,
and I salute you sir. We all love and
respect your supreme intellect and
are jealous. Good day.
Ahhh, the sweet amber nectar
