Left4Next
Week
A
s I write this, the Left-
4Dead2 demo is going
live worldwide. Alas,
we couldn’t delay these
pages in order to get any
coverage in, but judging by the average
of internet opinion that I can see from
my desk in the opulent Felix offices, it’s
looking very, very good indeed. Which
you probably expected, sure. But man,
has it really been a year since the first
game? It seems like only a few days ago
that we were experiencing No Mercy
for the first time.
It’s interesting to see a quality game
be extended so fast. It’s not exactly an
episodic policy, but a year has brought
more change to L4D2 than many would
think possible. Interesting, particularly
in the context of this week’s news that
episodic content brand Blurst is grind-
ing to a halt. The developer Flash-
bang, who had hoped to churn out a
game every eight weeks as a new busi-
ness model, this week admitted it just
wasn’t working.
So what is L4D2? A full release, done
in a year? Or a new, episodic extension
to L4D? What does episodic mean,
anyway?
What it might be is a reminder that
the wheel might not need to be rein-
vented all the time. Left4Dead’s core
is extremely solid, even a year after
release. No need to fuck around with
something like that. Instead, Valve
added to it, streamlined it, and put
more of the fun stuff in. The base was
already there – what they did was work
with it.
Maybe it’s time to look at episodic
content as a development process rath-
er than a consumer-end experience.
The idea that constructing a game is
about constructing a solid, reusable
base, that sequels can embellish with-
out having to rewrite.
The reason the boycott came about
with Left4Dead2 was the fact that it
seemed to be the same game, with
some tweaks and additions. Those
tweaks and additions, it so happens,
also include several twists on the origi-
nal concepts, and a bunch of brand
new campaigns. But they’re right – the
core hasn’t changed, because it doesn’t
need to.
What would we rather have? Piece-
meal additions like Fallout 3’s oc-
casional new level? Or wait twelve
months and get something between
the two – a seriously worthwhile set
of new features, without insisting the
developers upgrade their graphics en-
gine and pull a dozen new multiplayer
modes out of their arse? I know which
I’d rather.
Right. Almost done downloading...

Ten Long Years - 2002
S
ee? Last week I promised
you 2002 was a good year,
and here we are and so it is.
I don’t know about you, but
2002 was slap bang in the
middle of a big period of playing games
on consoles for me, and this meant a
year of jumping, smashing, running
and gunning, kicked off in style by the
sublime Jedi Knight 2 – Jedi Outcast
(or Dark Forces III if you’re old/an idi-
ot). Rudi has fond memories;
“The first meeting with a Dark Jedi
is one of those iconic gaming moments
for me, and the game knew how to
use its Star Wars canon to slather it-
self in atmosphere. Stealing aboard a
giant spaceship while it was in dock
and starting the next level on its bridge
while the hyperspace swirls fill the
viewports was just great.”
That it was. However, a Jedi Knight
game was small fry compared to what
was to come in the normally quiet sum-
mer period. Elder Scrolls III: Mor-
rowind came that June, and changed
RPGs forever.
“Like many games, once Morrowind
made the jump to ‘proper’ 3D, it
changed completely, and was able to
show people what it had tried to do
in previous games. The freedom was
overwhelmingly beautiful.”
Despite the hugely successful sequel,
Oblivion, many gamers have never left
Morrowind, and still mod it into the
latest generation, with huge detail and
graphics updates, as well as new things
to do in the expansive world.
Less than a month after Morrowind
came another equally huge game –
Warcraft III, a game that not only
spawned an RTS legend, but also
brought the Warcraft mythos so far
forward to allow, one day, for World of
Warcraft to come into being.
It wasn’t a unanimous hit, apparently.
Dan loved it: “Without a doubt one of
my favourite games ever, purely on the
basis of the fact that I’m still playing it
regularly today. It had a fantastic cam-
paign, amazing FMVs, and a reason-
able storyline, but more importantly
a sense of charm that I found missing
from earlier offerings.”

aboutthisone.But,uh,prophetically.Yeah.Let’sgetonwithit,eh?
Conan, however...
“Warcraft 2 took the piss out of fan-
tasy cliches but Warcraft 3 just em-
braced them. Did we really need an-
other Tolkienesque fantasy world? No
we didn’t.”
Dan apparently won, however, be-
cause DotA and its ilk are still being
played today, years on.
The GameCube had a few good
months, knocking out the bright and
breezy Super Mario Sunshine and the
long-awaited Animal Crossing within
a few weeks of each other. Sunshine
wasn’t loved by all Mario enthusiasts,
but it kept Nintendo’s innovation en-
gine going, and was certainly the most
painfully cheery and bright game
you’re ever likely to see.
Animal Crossing, of course, was dif-
ferent. But Animal Crossing is just dif-
ferent in general. Now on the DS and
the Wii, the Sims-but-not game
of relaxation was a huge hit on
the GC, and made 2002 one of
the more productive years for
the console.
Platformers had a good year
in general, with Mario being fol-
lowed up by Sly Cooper and Ratch-
et And Clank, both on the PS2.
Mike talks about R&C:
“R&C is now best known for
its ridiculous sequels where
they amped up the ‘destruc-
tion’ because they felt it was
the unique selling point of the
series. Unfortunately,
they were wrong.
For those that never
played it, R&C was a
3D, third-person plat-
former with guns,
where you played
Ratchet, a cat-like
creature whose planet
had been destroyed
by an alien race.
“The best the PS2
had before this was Jak And
Daxter. J&D was great, but the
depth and detail of the worlds blew
it out of the water. Smothered over this
is a sharp sense of humour, some genu-
inely interesting characters, and a great
combat system. It is the first and cur-
rently only game that I have 100%’ed.”
Though not as successful, Sly Coop-
er added a degree of style to the year’s
jump-and-smash games.
On the complete other end of the
happy-o-spectrum, came the Christ-
mas hit GTA: Vice City. The eight-
ies-themed crime spree is one of the
slickest of the series, with the possible
better of GTA4.
“The balance given to the setting, to
the era, isn’t so much that it becomes
a stupid parody, but it’s enough that
you can switch between laughing at
it all and actually pretending you’re in
Hawaii 5-0 comfortably. It’s a superbly
created piece of entertainment. Just
awesome.”
I’ve also been forced to promise to
mention No One Lives Forever 2. By
this guy:
“The graphics were, at the time,
stunning, with properly cinematic cut-
scenes that didn’t just feature talking
heads whose chins moved a bit when
they spoke. The shooting was great
and the variety of weapons and gadgets
was intoxicating. Apart from that one
FUCKING level in India.”
November also saw the launch of
XBox LIVE, a vast gamers network
which this week opened its doors to
Twitter, Facebook, Sky TV and more.
It’s been the key to Microsoft’s success
over Sony and Nintendo in the past
few years, although it had a relatively
shaky start initially because of its high
cost.
Gamecube’s second wind for the year
came with Christmas, when Resident
Evil Zero and Metroid Prime landed.
Wind Waker was around the corner
for the US and Europe, but in Japan,
that too was released before the
Christmas period was
over. Wind Waker is
a fond memory for
most gamers, and
one of the real visual
treats the Gamecube
of- fered in its lifetime.
Next year, though!
Next year.
