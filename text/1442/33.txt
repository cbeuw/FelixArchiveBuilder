No answers last week as there
wasn’t one to do. However we
have a new puzzles bitch, so say
hi to Sean and make him feel
very welcome by sending in lots
and lots of answers.

Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.
Seen that special
person? Could be
the one? Want to
see them again?

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number of lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be one
continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

It turns out that the answer to the

So, anyone for another round of arbi-
trary number crunching for the sake
of filling up a 30 minute or so break?
Last week’s solution was Tower Hill
(no spaces). Since you probably want to
spend more time on the other puzzles, I
won’t make this one too hard.

So which London tube station sums to 120?

Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to:
