We love pop
music
I
’ve got big, exciting, squeal-
inducing news. A felix music
website is coming! Not excited,
huh? Well try this out for size:
there’ll be longer, more in-depth
reviews, and weekly playlists of the
music we’ve been reviewing, so that
it’ll be easier for you guys to listen to
the music we’ve been talking about.
Excited now? Jeez, fine, just wait till
you see it. Then you’ll be sorry!
We’ve also re-introduced gig listings,
which you can see down there in the bot-
tom right-hand corner of the opposite
page. It seemed a little silly to only have
gig reviews, essentially just blowing our
tongues at you guys saying “See what you
missed out on!” Now you’ll have a heads-
up on just a little bit of London’s musical
offerings for the coming week.
A little final bit of housekeeping -
this year we’ve tried to have a number
of different articles and reviews for you
guys to read each week. Obviously the
amount of space we have is limited and
as a result, the articles and reviews are
going to be to the point; there’s just
no space to be long-winded. We think
it’s a better approach, but if you think
it’s the greatest catastrophe since the
Hindenburg went up in flames, then
send us an email on music.felix@gmail.
com and let us know.
Right, finally on to some music.
Jamie T’s new album Kings & Queens
is simply fantastic. Admittedly there’s
one god-awful song on it (Castro Dies)
but other than that it’s frenetic, witty,
exciting, and grabs you even harder
each time you decipher another of his
lyrics. He grabs samples from a range
of genres and piles them all together
to produce tunes like ‘The Man’s Ma-
chine’ and ‘368’. I’m fully aware that I
may be the only person who likes Jamie
T, but I’ve made a decision in this re-
gard; everyone’s wrong except me.
I kid you not, there exists in the
world an album called Gangstagrass,
from an artist called Rench. In es-
sence it’s gangsta rap combined beau-
tifully with good ole’ bluegrass. 22
tracks of banjo intertwined with tales
of the hood, and when you hear a fid-
dle overlaid with thug rap, you’ll never
think of either genre in the same way.
It’s not jarring either; as soon as you
hear the banjo and drums opening the
first track “Going Down”, it’s imme-
diately obvious and perfectly natural
that someone should lay a little rap
on.
The last bit of music that I feel the
need to tell you about is quite possibly
the happiest, most uplifting song ever
written by any human, ever. The song
is called Home, by a new LA band,
Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Ze-
ros. It’s a little country number, with
a couple singing to each other, south-
ern drawl included. It begins with the
heart-warming line, “Alabama, Ar-
kansas, I do love my ma and pa, not
the way that I do love you”. I dare you
not to feel better after listening to this
song. Seriously, it’s impossible.

Reviews
This melancholy brooding mixture of
post-rock, raw punk and grunge will
fail to ignite passion in you, as it lacks
focus and structure. The Karen-O style
singing is best displayed on the concise
‘Body Rot’ and ‘Bad Dream/Hartford’s
Beat Suite’, rare examples of the vocals
being sung in time or tune. The mean-
dering guitar often seems to be travel-
ling in a completely different direction
to the rest of the band. - Tom Jennings
This LP varies from mildly interesting
to thumpingly superb. It begins with a
rather generic drum & bass tune about
‘Strange Things’ that happen on Friday
nights. However, the rest of the CD is
simply pure gold. Horns, electro glibs
and deep bass all compete for attention
in a way that is immensely satisfying.

Morrissey
Royal Albert Hall
27th October
★★★★✩
A
fter a collapse onstage in
Swindon three nights previ-
ous, Morrissey walked out
onto the stage at the Royal
Albert Hall to an anxious crowd, hop-
ing a similar occurrence would not
ruin this evening. Tonight’s gig is actu-
ally rescheduled from May, and start-
ing the set with a Smiths classic ‘This
Charming Man’ he tells us ‘Fasten your
seatbelts it’s going to be a bumpy night’.
With a tour schedule already riddled
with cancellations due to illness, it’s
good to see him patch himself together
so quickly after being discharged from
hospital. He seems comfortable on
stage, with a commanding stage pres-
ence, and even in good spirits, joking
“The doctor said I shouldn’t smile. I
told him, ‘I don’t.’” Vocally it might not
have been his greatest ever perform-
ance, sometimes sounding strained,
but given the circumstances it was cer-
tainly very commendable.
A curious decision was to fake an-
other collapse, then get back to his
feet, saying ‘Thank you, Swindon’. That
certainly seemed in bad taste, and no
one really found it particularly funny.
The standard rant about vegetarianism
also came out; he wasn’t happy because
there were people in the crowd who
still eat meat. That aside, and all things
considered, a very solid performance
from one of the pillars of modern Brit-
ish music.
Morrissey’s still alive, whoo hoo!
Christopher Walmsley charmed by “This Charming Man”
Bristol has always been a mystifyingly
good place for electronic music, pro-
ducing the likes of Massive Attack,
Portishead and Tricky. Fuck Buttons
are continuing this tradition, debut-
ing last year with the hype-grabbing
album ‘Street Horrrsing.’ ‘Tarot Sport’
takes them into a different direction,
due to the influence of producer An-
drew Weatherall, renowned for bridg-
ing the gap between rock and dance.
Their noise-rock influences have been
made subtler, allowing their hooky
dance sensibilities to shine through.
The songs may all still be around the
10-minute mark, but they drill into
your consciousness. Combining this
with their already-present darkly lay-
ered sound, the album is a worthy ad-
dition to Bristol’s legacy. - Hugh Crail

The TV show is over, but you can re-
live the magic of New Zealand’s fourth
most popular rap-funk-comedy duo
with their second studio album. It’s
basically just the songs from the sec-
ond season in all their freaky splen-
dour. The fergie-licious ‘Sugalumps’ is
a hilarious ode to testicles everywhere,
while the call-and-response rap of
‘We’re Both In Love With A Sexy Lady’
parodies Usher & Kelly’s over-the-top
bromosexual anthem. As a comedy al-
bum, it’s pure gold. And hopefully you
might even see a sly DJ or two breaking
out ‘Too Many Dicks’ on a dancefloor
near you.

This slow-plodding acoustic pop,
evoking dreamy clouds and rolling
landscapes, certainly has a similar-
ity to indie birdband Doves. Gentle,
warm, and if they were in your house
you wouldn’t feel weird inviting them
into your bath, or into your bedroom
to sing you a lullaby. - Tom Jennings

SINGLE M&S are a masterpiece of a band, this
single as evidence. The use of human
voice for heartfelt harmonies and
huge emotion could cause a tear. This
is a beautifully composed song, with
amazing dynamics and careful layering
giving a sense of modesty. Listening
to this leaves me feeling at ease with
the future and direction of folk music.

The debut album ‘Taxi Taxi’ is sim-
ply beautiful. Whilst unlikely to be
hailed a groundbreaking work of lyri-
cal originality, the vocals are ultimately
compelling and endearing. They have a
child-like feel that can be jaunty - such
as in ‘Old Big Trees’ - or haunting and
startling - in opening track ‘Still stand-
ing at your back door’. I imagine that if
you enjoy Bon Iver, you’ll likely enjoy
this too, and I’m pretty sure that every-
one likes Bon Iver. - Kadhim Shubber

This album is unbearably exciting. It
taps a bit of Four Tet and Little Heath,
and some heavily distorted bass, to
produce an album that sounds and
feels fantastic. - Kadhim Shubber
