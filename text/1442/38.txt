never relinquish.
Lincoln did not give up without a
fight however, scoring 7 runs over the
next 3 innings - cutting the lead down
to 4. However with offensive contribu-
tions from the whole Imperial line-up,
that was as close as Lincoln would get.
The Falcons went on to score 10 runs
over the next 3 innings, winning 22-11
and securing the Fall Shield for Impe-
rial in our first ever tournament
Despite being fatigued from a full
day of baseball of Saturday, we were
in high spirits for our Sunday friendly
against the Nottingham Thieves - one
of the longest established university
baseball teams in the UK. Facing their
star pitcher, the Falcons struggled to
generate offence.
However Hajime Urata - pitching
for the Falcons - kept the game close,
holding the Nottingham line-up to one
run through the first 2 innings.
Things were looking up at one point,
with captain Gary Lam on first base
looking to steal second, but he was
caught off guard by a pickoff attempt
by the Nottingham pitcher, showing
the Falcons the consequences of not
paying attention.
Eventually the Falcons managed to
score a run in the final innings, with
some haphazard but fortunately suc-
cessful base running from David
Lloyd. However, our relative inexpe-
rience against the Thieves led to our
eventual 5-1 defeat. Nonetheless it
was a respectable result for the upstart
Falcons.
The weekend saw some great base-
ball played by all sides. All in all, it was
an impressive performance by the Fal-
cons, and we hope our first tournament
victory will spur us to greater success
over the coming year and beyond.
For those who are interested in join-
ing us, we meet at 1:30pm outside
Beit Quad every Wednesday and on
alternate Saturdays. Sessions involve a
mixture of practices at Hyde Park and
trips to Harlington and batting cages
in Northwick Park. There will be more
opportunities to play in tournaments
and friendly matches throughout the
year.
