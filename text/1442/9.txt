usicmetric is a grow-
ing company found-
ed by Imperial phys-
ics graduate Greg
Mead together with
two friends in February 2008. Another
Imperial graduate, Jameel Syed joined
the company in December 2008 as
their Chief Technological Officer.
His background is in the broad and
emerging field of data-mining. felix
was invited to talk to Greg, a Nightlife
and Music Editor for felix and Jameel,
about their business and how they got
there.
We met at their office where like
many start-ups, the atmosphere was
relaxed and their expensive hardware
sat alongside Xboxes and a foosball
table. Their clients can be anyone in
the music industry, but they mostly
deal with medium to large record la-
bels and management firms. They of-
fer software that allows them to access
relevant market information.
I started by asking how Greg’s time
at Imperial helped him set up his own
business, beyond the technical pro-
gramming skills he gained. “It made
it easier, definitely, in terms of access.”
Jameel had also benefited from a sum-
mer research project in data mining,
leading directly to his post-graduation
line of work. They were both excited
by the increased availability of support
for student enterprise in recent years,
“It will definitely help.”
Continuing our series on profiling successful start-ups with links to Imperial College, felix Business interviewed
two former Imperial students about their music industry data-mining company
managers. More importantly, they
want to turn their proucts to standard
tools within the idustry.
They already track five hundred
thousand bands and plan to expand
this to ten million. This number in-
cludes amateur bands such as those
in high schools, but is impressive
nonetheless. They have even grander
plans for where they want to be in
a few years time. They want to ap-
ply their data-mining techniques to
other industries, believing the scope

One of my favourites was their map
showing the geographic distribution
of fans. These allows bands to consider
having a tour stop in a town they were
previously unaware of being popular.
For example, it turns out that Robbie
Williams, whose managers are a nota-
ble client for musicmetric, is popular
Robbie Williams is not just a big client for musicmetric, he is also a personal
favourite of felix Editor Dan Wan (Ed. - He’s really not, it’s all about The Barlow)
in Northern Italy. so he could think
about maybe staging a gig there.
There are also some altogether clev-
erer applications of musicmetric’s
data-mining technology. They are able
to, as they put it, ‘calculate buzz’ and
‘analyse sentiment’. Their software
goes through websites, blogs, and oth-
er online sources of information. They
can then search for anything from the
number of pirate downloads of a par-
ticular track to pieces of text. These
can, for example, tell if audiences
thought lighting at a show was bad or if
they are keenly awaiting a new album.
Jameel is working on improving their
product line all the time. Their focus
for the next couple of years is going
to remain the music industry. During
this time, they aim to provide an even
broader range of services to artists and
Musicmetric currently offers three lev-
els of service to cater for casual, pro-
fessional and larger clients. The scope
of applications for their data analysis
is vast. For example, they can show
demographic information to help mu-
sicians target their marketing more
effectively. Greg says that this has be-
come even more important as a result
of advertising budget cuts caused by
the recession.

Running Musicmetric as a business
“Try and get your friends [on your
team]...If you can’t persuade your
friends or someone who knows a lot
about your idea to join, you know
you’re going to have problems,”
On this one the main advice was to
build prototypes. The guys admitted
to not using any of the prototypes that
theypitchedtoinvestorswith,because
they developed better models. But it
was still important to be able to show
what the software can do.
Raising capital to start a new
business
Starting a business with friends
Applying technical skills
Throughout the interview, good
advice came up for students with
regards to starting out in business.
“The first thing people who come out
of imperial with, say, a computing
degree need to learn is how people
use [computing degrees] in the real
world to achieve their business needs,”
suggests Jameel.
Top Tips for Imperial
students wanting to
start their own business
The company started off with little
more than an idea and a strong team
of people dedicated to it.
They soon secured a £400,000 in-
vestment and are now entering a sec-
ond investment round. This will en-
able them to continue growing and
to develop their latest ideas. Greg and
Jameel agreed that a good team has
always been essential in allowing the
business to flourish.
The staff at musicmetric had a pas-
sion for music as well as strong tech-
nical abilities, which begged the ques-
tion of what the balance was. Greg
answered, “[the balance between mu-
sic and technology] is reflected in the
make-up of the team. We have three
from more of a technical background
and three who are more interested in
the music industry.”
And how do you know that you have
the perfect team? “Obviously you have
to get on; you have to be able to do
what you do,” Greg continued. Jameel
added, “There are challenges that come
up every day...[as a new start-up] you
don’t have a department to deal with it
so people have to come forward.”
Although Greg and Jameel were very
happy with the people that worked at
musicmetric, they identified the need
to keep up with the workload as the
biggest challenge for all of them. This
can be a frequent issue at start-ups and
had been especially significant in recent
weeks as the firm had come up with a
number of new ideas that needed to
be worked on. As Jameel put it, “there
are always more good ideas [to fol-
low up on] than hours in the day.” So
the Xboxes and foosball table suffered
the sad fate of underuse. In fact, they
identified the kitchen as their favourite
part of a homely office because of its
convenience.
As well as expanding into other sec-
tors in which data analysis can help
participant firms’ performance, music-
metric wants to expand by going global.
“We have got to move outside of the
UK.”
Despite the hard work, Greg and
Jameel both clearly enjoy their work.
I asked what the best part was. “In
the industry, everyone knows eve-
ryone. You can be having a meeting
and mention you sold something to
someone and then [the people at the
meeting] will say ‘oh cool, he’s my best
friend.’”
