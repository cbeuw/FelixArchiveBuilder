You’ll wake up this week with
a splitting head in to the edi-
tor’s sex lair. You don’t realize
this immediately, but deduce
it from the selection of silly
hats and the post-it notes
reminding him to print Felix.
As an act of defiance you
evacuate your bowels onto
his shag pile rug and leave
swiftly.
Obviously it’s bad when your
deputy editor walks out on
you. You realise how much
you need them. Your life is
falling apart and you spend
your every waking hour lis-
tening to “Nothing Compares
2 U” on repeat. Having tidied
up the last of the consolatory
wank hankies, you tug one
out over his keyboard.
This week you finally dis-
cover your calling at Imperial
College as a meme maestro.
Unfortunately you’re too late
to join the fad, and get no
likes on your Facebook up-
load. Only one thing to do
now, drop out and fuck off
to UCL. We heard over there
memes are the only credit-
able part of every course.
Your job at a shag pile rug
cleaners gets weird when
some mentalist comes in
wearing a silly hat carrying a
rug that looks like it’s caked
in shit. You argue with him for
a bit saying that its beyond
cleaning, but the shag pile
rug business isn’t what it used
to be, so you begrudgingly
accept to clean it. Life’s Shit.
After spending the previ-
ous two and a half years of
your PhD on Spotify, you mi-
raculously discover a cure
for AIDS. Irritatingly, its side
effects include causing un-
controllable sexual lust in
the mothers of test subjects.
The Swedish take an hour
out of fucking their mothers
to award you the Nobel Prize.
In a sad moment of des-
peration, this week you find
yourself sitting in the lab on
Valentine’s Day watching An-
tiques Roadshow on iPlayer.
Even after knocking one out
to Fiona Bruce you still feel
hollow, empty and unfulfilled.
You hear about this new
AIDS cure. You pop a hand-
ful of pills and call home.
Can you believe that this week
your “friends” kidnap you and
decide to take you on a lads
holiday. Unfortunately you’re
too much of a post anorexic
girl and start crying like you’ve
just been buttfucked, staring at
your abductors with those soul-
less eyes. They feel bad and
take you home. You then catch
up on your masturbation.
After finally recovering from
a crippling accident that
occurred months ago, you
finally think you’re in the all
clear. Unfortunately you get
pushed down the stairs for
being a bitch and end up
eating your food through a
straw. No one cares, or even
visits you. To be honest You
had it coming.
This week, your arch-nem-
esis cures AIDS. Not one to
be bettered, you put on your
Ed Sheeran play list and set
about discovering some-
thing. By track 5 all you’ve
managed is to create milky
white substance that smells
like gash. You sell it to Da-
none as a pro biotic yoghurt
drink and make millions.
Normally when your “friend”
tells you a predictably boring
story about what he did last
night, you stand there nodding
your head, entertaining his life.
However this week you casu-
ally blurt out “Cool story bro.”
It doesn’t end well. Your friend
feeling dejected breaks down
sobbing. You offer to suck him
off, but even he thinks it weird.
This week, in the run up to
Valentine’s, you discover that
you can save yourself a lot of
embarrassment by just get-
ting touchy-feely with yourself
at the end of a night. That way
you can both get your mitts on
something that’s warmer than
room temperature whilst also
being hugged and caressed
yourself. You realize that...
To Aquarius: ”Cool story bro.”
This week you’ll build a wall
out of the snow you piled up
from last weekend. Thinking
it’ll save you from mothra’s
laser eyes, to sleep comfort-
able at night. Idiot! Lasers +
Snow = Bad. Inevitably she
breaks in like a rapist and
rants at you about this year’s
club budgeting.
Ed, It’s Homs. Not homes.
Ffs. Syria crisis getting out of hand.
Cba with Syria.
