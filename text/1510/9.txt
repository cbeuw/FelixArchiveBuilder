Tim: We’re a student newspaper and
you went to university as I infer from
the fact that you were in the Chor-
tle Student Comedian of the Year
Awards 2008?
Chris: Yes, very well done, fucking
Sherlock lives on. Yeah I was at Sun-
derland Uni, which is not really any-
thing to brag about, but I was only do-
ing Film and Media. But yeah I packed
in half way through my final year and
ended up doing stand up. I’d done the
first paragraph of my dissertation and I
went ah fuck this and just stopped.
T: Now that your friends know that
you’re a stand-up comedian, do you
feel pressured to be funny in normal
conversations?
C: I’ll tell you what, this is genuinely
true, beware right, because if you end
up doing a bit of stand up, once you
are a stand up comic, you are no lon-
ger the funniest one in your group of
mates. It’s fucking weird. It’s really
bizarre. If you start being really funny
with them, everyone just goes: “alright
mate you’re not on stage now”. It’s just
really strange, I can’t explain it.
With my friends when they’re all
taking the mick out of each other and
having a laugh; I always come in far
too strong and ruin it, like I come in
with an awful, horrible insult. It’s just
really weird – your barometer totally
changes.
T: Do you think that now that you’re
known, when people see you on stage
they actively try to heckle as they
think: “Right, I’m getting one over
on him”?
C: They can try. I did Manchester
Comedy Store on Saturday Night, I did
the late show and it was just 20 minutes
of heckles and 20 minutes of me just
slamming into everyone who opened
their fucking mouth, was good fun.
T: I’m guessing you’re very
calm and aren’t going to be
fazed.
C: Yeah essentially, I mean there
are still heckles that can
throw you off, but
you get to a point
man where every-
thing they can
shout out is the
same. There
are only a few
different an-
gles you
can go
with a
heck-
le. No matter what the words are it can
either be an insult, a funny comment,
a comment on something you’ve done,
or it can be sarcastic, or it can some-
times be complimentary, which is al-
ways weird.
T: I wouldn’t know how to reply to
that. I guess just thank you, okay,
I’m going to get back to my material
now.
C: Yeah a few times a girl’s shouted
“you’re fit” and I’ve been like “that
is not relevant at all, shut up, do you
know what I mean? First of all, don’t
heckle compliments cause it just
throws us off. I’d rather you called me
a cunt, if you can believe that. It has
got no relevance to the performance,
just shut up.
T: (laughs) I don’t know, to be hon-
est, maybe you should have tried to
get her number after that?
C: (laughs) Nah: they’re normally nut-
ters. If you’re shouting out “you’re
fit” to a boy on stage at a comedy club
you’re not normal are you?
T: I think that’s probably the female
equivalent of beeping your horn
when you see someone attractive
walking across the road.
C: Exactly, or hanging out of a white
van going “get your tits out love”.
T: Do you have sort of set responses
to them? As in, if someone says this
about my hair I’m going to say this?
C: Yeah well first of all it will depend
on what they look like. A lovely little
trick I like to do, if I’m doing my own
show and someone heckles from the
back, I go: “Alright you’re just heck-
ling there from the back in the darkness
and I want to see you… house lights
up” and then the sound man
will put all the fucking
lights on and they just
sit there shitting their
pants. They just didn’t
even think I had the
power to do that. I love
getting house lights on, it
really levels the playing
field – it’s great.
T: Have you ever had
a joke or routine that
you’ve said that some-
one’s either stolen, or
someone’s just thought
of it independently,
and you’ve thought:
“ah no I can’t use that
now”?
C: Yeah, I thought of something when
I was first starting out. I thought of like
3 heckle putdowns in a row that were
about someone’s mum that were this
full little routine thing. I did it on stage
and this guy came up and he went ‘oh
erm that’s on Jimmy Carr’s DVD”. I
was like ah shit. He said go on You-
Tube and it was fucking word for word
what I’d written – I was devastated.
I’ve never stolen material and I never
would steal material. I think it’s just
the worst crime in comedy. There are
some people who keep doing it as well.
I know a comic who did a routine and
you go “such and such has been doing
that for years” and they go “yeah, well,
I thought of it, I didn’t copy off them,
so I’ll keep doing it” and it’s like well
you can’t do that.
If you started writing a book and
someone said: “oh by the way mate,
Charles Dickens wrote that years ago
about Christmas. It’s exactly the same
as the one you’ve written” and you go
“well I thought of it, I’m going to keep
writing it”. No-one’s going to fucking
buy it are they. David Johnston’s A
Christmas Carol.
T: Have you got a writing process?
Do you sit down at a laptop, or just
randomly think of stuff?
C: No I haven’t got one at all. Some
comics can sit down and click away
but I can’t do it. If something tickles
my fancy, I do it in sort of really short,
sharp, bursts and then work most of it
out while I’m on stage. So I just do it
on the fly really. I can’t sit and write a
full routine; if I do I just end up not be-
ing able to remember it.
T: A lot of comedians nowadays go
into acting. Are you thinking of do-
ing that? Any TV shows you’d like
to do?
C: Yeah, there’s one on the horizon ac-
tually, but it hasn’t been officially an-
nounced yet so I can’t say anything.
T: Have you ever done any acting or
is it just you’re a comedian so you
thought “meh, might as well give it
a go”?
C: The particular thing in question,
there was a thing in Manchester called
the sitcom trial. We had to do a big live
run through of the sitcom – like a play.
We did it all in one go in front of a live
audience and it was mad to do. That
was my first proper foray into acting,
unless you count playing Santa in a
school nativity when I was 5.
T: (laughs) I don’t know, you could
have had a starring role then.
C: Actually, don’t think it was 5, think
I was 7. It’s not a very big point, but
that’s two years of serious maturity of
my acting career from 5 to 7.
T: Those were your Brando years
when you were getting your method
acting on. Is acting weird compared
to comedy because you’re saying
someone else’s words?
C: Yeah, it’s really weird. I’d never
done it and I felt like I couldn’t do it.
Then people are going “no you’re good
at this” and I just thought they were
lying. Every time they were saying
you’re good at this, I was holding eye
contact for a bit too long to see if they
looked away.
T: Do you think the state of comedy
nowadays is healthy?
C: For someone at my level and up-
wards it’s healthy. I think it’s going to
start getting harder for new people to
start breaking through. I’m lucky that
I broke through when I did. I hope the
smaller clubs don’t suffer, because
you’ve just got to look in your local
culture guide and there’ll be about
four fucking comedians there this
month doing shows, which is brilliant,
but, what’s that doing to the smaller
clubs? A lot of people are saying that
it happened in America: apparently
the smaller clubs just died out and all
the touring comics took over. I’ve got
to say I’m glad I’m on tour, but really
hope that doesn’t happen.
T: When was your first show? Do you
remember it?
C: Yeah it was mad actually. There was
a ferry from Newcastle to Amsterdam.
I was on it with my mates and there was
an entertainer, like a comedian, on the
stage and he was doing alright. It was
a little bit sort of juggly and kind of
stuff like that bit more family friendly.
He had what was either some kind of
stroke, or a heart attack, and he sort of
keeled over. My mate was a medical
student and looked after him for a bit. I
picked up the mic to put it back in the
stand and I ended up saying something
to someone, and just started messing
about, and before I knew it I’d done 40
minutes of this routine, just impromptu
on this boat. The guy died and I got his
job.
