FELIX
B
ack home in the Mid-
lands, there is an ex-
tremely popular bus
company known as Trent
Barton. Like just about
every other bus company in the world,
you get on the bus, you pay some mon-
ey, and they drive you to where you
want to go. Some of their competitors
are faster at getting to some destina-
tions, and are sometimes cheaper too.
So why do they remain much loved and
admired throughout the East Midlands?
The reason for this is clear: they value
the community they created around
their products.
If you have a product, there is a mas-
sive amount of potential to tap into the
community you have. If you have us-
ers, they are there for your use. Think-
ing of bringing out a new brand? Ask
them for their opinion. Need a new ad-
vertising campaign? Run a promotion
with your customers. This increases
customer satisfaction, makes them feel
appreciated, and can even be good PR
for the company.
Indeed, it just goes to show that a
company is not just about making mon-
ey, at least not in the current day and
age. It’s about looking after your com-
munity and making them feel appreci-
ated and part of the family – the success
of Trent Barton is testament to this!
So why is it, then, that some compa-
nies and organizations treat their com-
munity badly, if not ignoring them? As
we have seen on Felix Online, when
postgraduates heard of the potential
closure of the Holland Club, they were
up in arms! Having been left complete-
ly out of the loop, the postgraduates, the
New library door, satisfaction skyrockets?
Abandon all hope all ye who neglect
your community
community in this case, became angry
and even felt neglected (as Thomas
Phillip’s recent Comment article sug-
gested).
Simply looking after the people
whose patronage you rely upon could
have prevented a lot of this from hap-
pening.Alack of communication leaves
the community out of the loop and dis-
connected – ruining the potentially ex-
cellent relationship that an organization
could have with its community.
College is not the only one guilty of
this. We can look at Elsevier, for ex-
ample. Controversial business practices
alienated the community – causing
them to revolt, as we saw with the re-
cent boycott. By treating them in a way
that they could not agree with, their
community turned against the compa-
ny, which did not aid them; and the bad
press worsened their reputation. Again,
by simply working with the commu-
nity, such as by holding discussions to
see if what they were doing was popu-
lar, this whole disaster could have been
averted.
And why is it that organizations such
as John Lewis are often more trusted
and liked than competitors such as
House of Fraser (according to a You-
Gov study)? It’s a well-known fact that
John Lewis is a partnership of which
all staff has a stake in, and it’s this fair
treatment that looks good in the eyes of
the community, and increases percep-
tion of the brand. Motivated and happy
staff provide a better level of service to
the customer, who feel that they are be-
ing treated well and whose patronage is
actually valued by the company.
Some would argue that a public body
T
he new Library entrance
was today unveiled in
what is already being
called a stunning coup
for students. The en-
trance, which whilst still in the same
place, now encompasses an incredible
3.75m2
, will provide untold numbers
with easier access to Imperial’s cov-
eted study areas.
It will certainly be a relief to many
students to find that the outrageous
‘face-on’ style previously employed
has been scrapped in favour of two,
more acceptable, side entrances.
“Frankly, I was this close to writing
a letter of complaint about the posi-
tioning of the entrance – it was really
dangerous and offensive” said one
student who wished to remain anony-
mous.
As well as its clear benefits to stu-
dents’ comfort and safety, the entrance
will also encourage more students to
use the facilities contained within. “I
never used the library before, but I’ll
certainly consider it now,” said anoth-
er student before adding, “although
I’m not sure what I’d do once inside”.
Not only does the new entrance rep-
resent an unheralded show of good
will by Imperial College towards its
students, but the building work was
impeccably timed. The decision to
start building in the winter months
during term time was, without a doubt,
not straightforward. However it was
entirely vindicated as students were
finally able to appreciate some of the
behind-the-scenes work that goes into
making Imperial tick. Sure, the li-
brary café was cold enough to make
the crew of Frozen Planet think twice
about eating there and more crowded
than most places are legally allowed to
be, but there was strong positive feed-
back from interviewed students indi-
cating that the timing of construction
really made them feel looked after.
Students from the Life Sciences ap-
peared to be amongst the happiest at
has a duty to look after the community,
and that for a private organization this
is not necessary. And it is true, public
bodies should – one can consider it a re-
sponsibility of using funds provided by
taxpayers (and is also why it is so sad
that many establishments are seeming
to become increasingly more commer-
cially focused – run as companies and
not institutions). And it is true, public
bodies should: one can consider it a re-
sponsibility of using funds provided by
taxpayers. This is why it is so sad that
many establishments seem to become
increasingly more commercially fo-
cused, run as companies and not insti-
tutions. But private companies should
take heed too – just because the public
doesn’t run the company doesn’t mean
they don’t have a view over how they
are run and how they interact.
Ruining this relationship helps no-
the sight of the entrance. The depart-
ment underwent serious perestroika
last year resulting in excellent lectur-
ers losing their jobs and many stu-
dents feeling betrayed by their uni-
versity; however, reaction has been
overwhelmingly positive. “At first
I was doubtful that a new entrance
could repair the cracks created by the
restructuring process, but now I’ve
seen the entrance myself, it’s certain-
ly worth three or four good lecturers”
said 2nd year biochemist Lee Sewell.
With this kind of investment in stu-
dents, Imperial will surely look for-
ward to rocketing up the student sat-

body. The company or organization
in question loses trust, and as a result,
custom and reputation. It becomes less
likely that people recommend friends
to their services, and they can even
become labelled as ‘nasty people’ or
‘bullies’ – we just have to look at the
recent outrage over the bonus of RBS
boss Stephen Heston for an example of
the ill-feeling that can result from such
a disconnect. In my eyes, it would not
be unfair to call it commercial suicide.
Luckily for employees everywhere,
dressing up in a giant mango costume
(as Trent Barton has its staff do) is not
a necessary part of nurturing the rela-
tionship a company or organization has
with its community. But if trust and
custom is wanted, respecting the com-
munity is a necessary part, and is one
that must not be forgotten in the urge to
make money and boost profits.
