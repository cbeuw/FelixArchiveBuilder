Winning ways
Undefeated so far this season (with
only one draw to compliment our
string of wins), we arrived at the
Staines pitch in high spirits, despite
the freezing temperatures and re-
mains of snow on the sidelines. One
rapid warm-up later, and we were un-
derway.
The standard was slightly different
from the team we had beaten 15-0
the week before. We started slowly,
waiting a whole ten minutes before
the first goal – Kirstin lifting the ball
over the keeper’s stick from a scrappy
rebound. Teddy secured our second
goal, with some great work from Gigi,
before hearts were once again racing
as Holloway piled on the pressure in
our defending half. Some strong de-
fence from Ash and Celia soon saw
them off, allowing Teddy the chance
to score our third, grabbing the op-
portunity after a serious of rebounded
attempts in the attacking ‘D’.
The second half started with us
fired up, ready to expand our lead;
we had to keep moving to avoid the
ever colder conditions, and our con-
fidence didn’t wane. Our continued
attacks finally bore fruit as Jill, our
captain, fired one past the keeper
from the top of the ‘D’. Emma and
Maria in defence with Jess in goal had
a little more to do this half, but Hol-
loway never looked like scoring, and
we continued our pressure on their
defence. Harry’s work with help from
Nora in midfield soon took our fifth
goal, shooting the ball past a static
defence.
The final whistle couldn’t come
soon enough after that, and we piled
back into the warm of the mini-bus
back to Imperial for a well-deserved
drink.

prevail in icy
conditions
Despite the sub-zero temperatures for this
outdoor fixture in Chiswick, both teams
came out ready for a fight and the match
started off as an end-to-end struggle.
UWL opened the scoring; a clinical finish
despite some sloppy play around the D.
Predictably, the first IC goal came from
Tsang, followed in quick succession by a
beauty from Batchelor - hardly surprising
given the top form both the shooters have
been on this season.
IC were a constant threat in front of
goal and UWL failed to show any resil-
ience – with the home side unable to pro-
duce any game-changing play, IC stormed
ahead in spectacular fashion, closing up
the first half comfortably 30-11.
As UWL returned after the halftime
break it was clear that their fighting spirit
had been entirely consumed by the icy
conditions. IC made UWL’s miserable
afternoon a whole lot worse by scoring 20
goals in the second half, with little diffi-
culty. UWL tried some interesting tactics,
like removing Club Captain Hazell’s shoe
in a desperate attempt to prevent her as-
sisting a goal, but to no avail. Trainerless,
and with nothing but a surprised squeal,
she calmly set Batchelor up for a clean
finish. Tsang’s superb shots throughout
the game earned her player of the match,
in the coldest game anyone can ever re-
member playing, IC 3s maintained their
unbeaten record this term and moved up
into 2nd place in the ULU league. With a
game in hand, a fully fit squad and another
team added to the long list of victims, life
is looking pretty sweet for IC Netball 3s
right now.
