TEMPORARY HALLS IN WATERLOO AND
ELEPHANT & CASTLE CONSIDERED
Potential plans for a proposed renova-
tion of the Holland Club have been
provided as part of the area’s ongo-
ing feasibility study this week. The
Holland Club Committee has voiced
its disapproval over what it considers
to be a lack of communication from
those in charge of the study, while Im-
perial College Union President Scott
Heath has stated his desire to consider
the views of students under any po-
tential changes to the set-up and run-
ning of the establishment.
The plans, which have not yet been
confirmed, propose a significant
change in layout to the current Hol-
land Club, with the plans document-
ing a transformation of the staff bar
into a ‘café bar’, ‘bar extension’ and
‘cellar pub’. According to the plans,
this would allow for an increase in
room space from the current 193.9m2
of the Holland Club bar to 349.2m2
for the three additions. There has not,
however, been any indication as to
whether the proposed spaces would
be exclusive to either staff or students.
The Holland Club committee met
on Monday with Project Director Jane
Neary, the project champion Stephen
Richardson, Dan Curtis senior project
manager, along with representatives
from Imperial College Union where
the plans were presented. Following
the meeting, Manager of the Holland
Club, Kevin Young told Felix that:
“We could quite easily provide the
services they are asking for with our
present setup, we just need to invest
in some paint and catering equipment,
furniture down stairs and a general
tidy up and improved disabled access
which I think could be done quite eas-
ily and a lot more cost effective.”
The Committee has also expressed
its dismay over the date of a meeting
of the Portfolio Review Board (PRB)
– which oversees projects in Build-
ings, ICT and Facilities Management
– being brought forward from the sec-
ond quarter of 2012 to February 24.
At this meeting the results of the fea-
sibility study will be reviewed.
