Bake some romance
These are seriously decadent crowd-
pleasers. I’ve made them twice for
two group gatherings of different sizes
– we’re talking at least 15 people, and
they get snapped up quite nicely (the
latter actually had 30-odd people!)
They need a little bit of pre-planning
and forethought, though; because mak-
ing them is a two-stage process that in-
cludes baking and overnight chilling (or
at least 6 hours if you make them in the
morning for a dinner treat); but they’re
very well worth the wait so they’ll
make a great do-ahead dessert.
I used Philadelphia Light to make
these cakes; but any mild-flavored
cream cheese will do - it can even be
supermarket own brand cheese! You
can use brown or caster sugar for these
cheesecakes – personally I prefer using
soft dark brown sugar, because you’ll
get a lovely rich color that visually
complements how indulgent these are.
If you opt for caster sugar, you’ll get
a lovely contrast between the very pale
cheesecake batter and the dark pieces
of Twix. Taste-wise the difference is so
mild; so your choice of sugar just boils
down to what your visual preferences
are.
Also, if you really want to cut a few
corners, use Sainsbury’s own brand
chocolate toffee biscuit fingers as dupes
for Twix.
Crust:
– 20 Oreos (a typical 154g package
contains about 14)
– 50g unsalted butter, melted
Cheesecake batter:
– 450g cream cheese, softened (leave
it out at room temp for 1-2 hours before
using.)
– 100g caster/brown sugar
– 1⁄2 tsp vanilla extract
– 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
– 125ml sour cream
– 12 mini/fun size Twix bars
Preheat oven to 135°C. Prepare either
a 12-hole muffin case (line it with paper
cases) or a square/rectangular baking
tin/brownie tray lined with greaseproof
paper (I had a 10”x7” one.)
Either chuck the Oreos in a food bag
and bash into fine crumbs with a rolling
pin, or do the same thing to them in a
food processor. Mix in the melted butter
thoroughly until it all comes together.
If you’re using the 12-hole muf-
fin case, divvy up the cookie crumbs
between the 12 paper cases and press
down with your fingers. Otherwise,
chuck all the crumbs on the lined bak-
ing tin/brownie tray and press down
with the back of a spoon/your hands.
That’s your base(s) done – set it aside
(you could even pop it in the fridge for
a little while) while you work on the
batter.
Tip your cream cheese in a mixing
bowl and get out your torture imple-
ment – I mean, mixer of choice. You
can use a hand/stand mixer or a bog
standard wire whisk; I opt for the latter
because the workout keeps bingo wings
from forming (girls, take heed!) Beat
the cream cheese until it’s smooth, then
slowly beat in your sugar.
Thoroughly mix in the vanilla, and

Can’t spell cheesecake without ‘eese’. As in ‘ease’? Yeah? Thought not

Vegan Pie In The Sky by Isa Chandra
Moskowitz
The great thing about this recipe is
that you use olive oil instead of butter
and this makes your apple pie much
healthier. The olive oil makes the crust
extremely flaky and you cannot taste it!
This recipe makes a 9 inch pie.
For the crust:
– 2.5 cups all purpose flour
– 3⁄4 tsp salt
– 2⁄3 cup olive oil
– 4-8 tbsp ice water
– 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
For the filling:
– 6 cups Granny Smith Apples cut in
slices
– 1⁄3 cup brown sugar
– 1⁄2 cup white sugar
– 1 teaspoon cinnamon
– 1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger
– 1⁄8 teaspoon ground cloves
– 3 tablespoons all purpose flour
– Pinch of salt
Ingredients
3 eggs
3 glasses of self raising flour
3⁄4 glass of sugar
3⁄4 glass of oil
1 glass of milk
3 tsp of Baking Powder
1 tbsp of cognac
2 tbsp of Drinking Chocolate
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F.
Beat the oil and the sugar together until
smooth. Whisk the eggs and add them
to the previous mixture. Add the milk,
the baking powder and the cognac and
keep whisking. Once the mixture is
ready, add the flour and stir until fully
combined. Grease a baking tin with
butter or oil and pour half of the mix-
ture in it. Pour the drinking chocolate in
the other half and stir. Add it in the bak-

beat in the already-lightly-beaten eggs
(at low speed if using electric beaters.)
Then add in your sour cream and mix
until fully incorporated. Batter consis-
tency should be somewhere in between
single and double cream.
Set the bowl aside and get your
Twix/biscuit fingers into small chunks
– I usually chop it in half lengthways,
then proceed to chop as normal in the
other direction. Chuck the chunks into
the bowl of cheesecake batter and fold
them in well.
Pour the whole lot into the baking tin/
brownie tray and smooth out; or if using
the muffin tray, use an ice-cream scoop
to divvy up the batter into the cases.
Bake the lot for 30-40 minutes at
135°C (if using the muffin tray); or
for 45-50 minutes if you’re using an
oblong/square tin. They’re done bak-
ing when they still wobble a lil’ bit in
the center. Let cool, and then pop them
in the fridge overnight/for at least six
hours.
After chilling, take them out and cut
them up using a knife moistened with
hot water.

Classic Apple Pie by Yiango Mavrocostanti
For the topping:
– 1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
– 2 tablespoons sugar
– 2 tablespoons soy milk or any milk
of your choice
One hour before making the crust
place the olive oil in the refrigerator un-
til it becomes like a sorbet. In a mixing
bowl combine the flour with the olive
oil and the salt. Then add the ice water
and vinegar slowly until you can shape
the dough into a ball. Do not overmix.
Divide the ball into two equal discs
and place each one of them between
two sheets of wax paper. Roll each disc
into a circle.
Preheat your oven at 218°C. Fit half
the pie dough into a 9-inch pie pan. In a
bowl combine all the filling ingredients
and add them to the prepared pie shell.
Place on top the rest of the dough and
brush it with the milk.
Then sprinkle with the cinnamon and
sugar. Bake the pie for 25 minutes at
218°C and then lower the heat and bake
for another half an hour.
Let it cool before serving.

and bake for almost 45 minutes. Leave
the cake to cool before you remove it
from the tin.
Top tip : Do not open the oven before
the first 20 minutes, if you want your
cake to rise properly.
