“The correct idea is to march the
king to b6 and so white should
begin with Ka5! (but not Kb5
because 1. Kb5 Rg8 2. Kb6 Rc8 3.
Ne7+ Rc6+ 4. Bxc6# is only mate
in 4) now if black has two serious
options to consider:
1...Kb7 2. Ne7+ Ka7 3. Nc8#
1...e1=Q 2. Kb6 Rg1 3. Nc7#
Note that also Rg8 doesn’t work

Nd4!+ Ka7 3. Nb5#. Quite a tough
puzzle.”

SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots.
The numbers in each square in-
dicate how many edges of the
square are part of the loop, so
if it contains a “2”, you know
that two and only two out of
four edges have lines. That’s all
the info you need to get the one
logical answer (though waiting a
week to see the solution will also
do). Answers to puzzles.felix@
imperial.ac.uk, as the puzzles
team recieves one internship
rejection per correct solution.

Word Wheel
Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using the
central one. NO plurals, conjugated
verbs, comparatives or superlatives,
because I said so.. There is always at
least one 9 letter word.
TARGET: 26
