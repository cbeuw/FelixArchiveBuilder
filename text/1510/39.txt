Snooker: warm-up
tournament success

FELIX Friday 10 february 2012 39
ICU Snooker enjoyed their best ever
performance at the Midlands Universi-
ties Snooker Championships, which in-
cluded top-four finishes for both a new
look second team in the Team Trophy
and first team captain Bilal Nasim in the
Individual Championship.
After an early 9am arrival at Rileys
in Coventry last Saturday, the action
kicked off immediately with the first
round matches of the Individual Cham-
pionship and Trophy.
Thanks to a combination of some
well-crafted breaks, the highest an im-
pressive 58 by ex-under-19 Romanian
Champion Bogdan Cozmaciuc, and
some good fortune in the form of byes
for Elwin Carlos, Bo Tan and Grace
Yip, only two of the ten Imperial repre-
sentatives failed to make it past the first
round in either competition; Shengyang
Cheng was beaten 2-0 by Cardiff’s Da-
vid Sattaur in the Trophy and, despite
a courageous break of 32, Julius Guth
lost his Championship match against
Nottingham’s Tom Laycock.
Later, second round wins for Nasim,
Nitesh Mehta and second team captain,
Yip, meant Imperial had three players
through to the following day’s round of
16 matches.
In the evening the team events, with
Davis Cup-style rubbers matches, got
underway and neither the first nor sec-
ond teams started particularly well.
The first team, consisting of Messrs
Nasim, Cozmaciuc, Carlos, Mehta and
Guth, fell behind 3-1 to Oxford 1s while
the second team faced a 4-1 deficit in
their match against Warwick 3s.
However, a fantastic fight back in
which Yip, Cheng, Tan, Edward Gra-
ham and Jonathan Hoong all won their
final frames completed a 6-4 victory for
the second team.
Furthermore, a gripping re-spotted
black ball finish involving Mehta
helped the first team on their way to
claiming a 5-5 draw.
The drama continued late into the
night as Imperial 1s then defeated Kent
1s 6-3 while their second team counter-
parts fought out a 5-5 draw, culminating
in an epic final frame re-spotted black
defeat for Yip and a 1am finish.
Dispelling the rumours that snooker
players are not physically fit, all ten
Imperial cueists then undertook an ar-
duous twenty minute trek through the
thick Coventry snow to reach the teams’
hotel and eight hours later all were back
in the confines of Rileys in an effort to
replicate the previous day’s unbeaten
run.
The first major setback of the week-
end involved Imperial 1s, who held
hosts Warwick to a 5-5 stalemate before
a crushing 6-1 defeat to Manchester 1s
ended hopes of a Championship semi-
final place, losing out only on frame dif-
ference to Warwick.
York 3s then threatened to spoil
things for the second team by producing
an Imperial-style comeback at 5-1 be-
hind but the cool (and shaved) head of
Cheng secured a 6-4 victory and second
spot behind Trophy Group B winners
Southampton 2s, to whom they lost 6-1.
The following 6-0 whitewash in the
semi-final at the hands of eventual Tro-
phy winners Warwick 2s did nothing to
detract from a great display by the sec-
ond team during the weekend.
Yet even after over 26 hours of com-
petitive snooker, the tournament was
still not over for Imperial.
Step up, Bilal (the Prince) Nasim,
who won his third round match to be-
come the last remaining team member
in the individual competition after Yip
and Mehta bowed out in the last 16 and
quarter finals respectively.
Arguably the underdog, Nasim looked
to be heading out, too, as he fell 1-0 be-
hind to the formidable Rhys Carpenter
of Cardiff in their quarter final contest.
However, after nicking the second
frame on the final black, breaks of 20
and 24 helped earn Nasim a last four
match-up against double BUCS Cham-
pion Mark Green.
Although Nasim went on to lose to
Green, who later claimed victory in
the final, such was the nature of his
achievement that six other team mem-
bers missed the last train back to Lon-
don in order to watch the semi final
clash.
Many thanks should go to Warwick
University Snooker Club for organising
such a great tournament.
Moreover, after some fantastic per-
formances, especially from Nasim and
a second team fielding three debutants,
hopes of further success at the season-
ending BUCS Snooker Championships
are sky-high. Can Imperial defend their
Team Trophy and complete a hat-trick
of titles?
On this evidence, why not?
Riding 1st team grab league top spot
The first riding team have moved into
first place in their league after an im-
pressive win in Buckinghamshire on
Wednesday. Picking up individual 1st
3rd and 7th places, Rachel Gregory,
Ilse daly, Sinead Conneely and Mi-
kaela Bryant-Meisner are now in a fa-
vourable position with two competi-
tions left, one being their home event
at Trent Park in Oakwood.
The morning got off to a cold start
with snow still on the ground at
Snowball Park when the show jump-
ing started. After 16 rounds on some
horses who weren’t so keen on keep-
ing the fences up Imperial college
had a 30 point lead, with Gregory and
Daly holding joint first individually.
The dressage horses proved to be
even more difficult to handle than the
showjumpers but the team held their
own, extending their lead to 49 points
at the end of the day. Gregory finished
up with zero penalties to take the
overall win, an impressive result as
today’s judge noted that this year the
competition showcased some of the
highest standard of riding she’s seen
at University level.

ing club email riding@ic.ac.uk.
