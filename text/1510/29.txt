Following Galliano’s dismissal just days be-
fore Dior’s A/W 2011-12 show, the whirlwind
of rumours about who would take his place of
14 years, leading one of fashion’s most monu-
mental houses has continued to distract from
the fashions on the catwalk, replacing the
fantasy with flurries of intrigue. Who would
be able to fill these prodigious shoes? No
viable options have presented themselves,
with all prime candidates seemingly con-
tent in the positions they currently hold.
From Louis Vuitton’s alluringly versa-
tile Marc Jacobs, Givenchy’s prince
of darkness Riccardo Tisci, the young
and rebellious Haider Ackermann,
Jil Sander’s modern man Raf Si-
mons, and even the designer of
perfect dresses Azzedine Alaïa,
the position remains unfilled
three seasons later.
Nevertheless, the house of
Dior has continued to fill its slot at Paris
fashion week under the undeniably weaker
hand of Bill Gaytten who spent 15 years as
the right-hand man of Galliano. Gone are Gal-
liano’s dramatic tales of dark glamour, and
never again will our hearts flutter at the sight
of a tulip dress or yearn to go riding side-
saddle in masterfully tailored jackets before
being swept away to a ball swathed in layers
of satin.
This is not to say that Gaytten hasn’t made
a fair attempt at trying to fill the position un-
ceremoniously laid at his door, but given 15
years of working under the promiscuous vi-
sionary of design that Galliano undoubtedly
was, you might have suspected a somewhat
stronger desire to show the world his own
well of pent up talent. Alas, that has not been
the case. Instead, the former
house of dreams has given
us season after season of
restrained, safe designs
and far too heavy a re-
liance on Christian
Dior’s legend-
ary archives,
resulting in
craftsmanship
of John Gal-
liano by continuing
to buy, and hence
support, the house
that so quickly
turned on its own
saviour? Indisput-
ably, what Galliano
said was inexcusable,
but do buyers not realise
that the items they now
purchase no longer hold
that enchanting feel that
Galliano breathed into his
every design, and the clear
love and understanding he
had of the legend of Dior?
It is a prerequisite that a de-
signer taking the reins of a
A
s unlikely as it may seem, I
have found myself swapping
the glossy pages of Vogue for
the less conveniently sized
Financial Times this week as
the recently realised flurry of financial figures
drag my attention away from the conventional
pre-fashion-week buzz.
Instead of delighting in the prospect of see-
ing Michael Kors’ first post-IPO collection of
luxe loungewear in New York next week, or
eagerly awaiting to be swept away by Sarah
Burton’s lace and leather embellished god-
desses at Alexander McQueen later in Paris;
I find myself, rather uncharacteristically, por-
ing over Christian Dior’s annual earnings re-
port.
Similar to an oblivious fat seal skimming
the turbulent waters of the melting Arctic
oceans, not only has the luxury market contin-
ued to plump out its profits in such harsh eco-
nomic times, with multinational luxury goods
conglomerate LVMH’s sales up 14% from
last year on a like-to-like basis, the rumour-
enshrouded house of Christian Dior has man-
aged to ride out the storm with increased sales
of 21% over the last three quarters of 2011.
Instead of joining the shareholders of said
companies in celebrating such figures as we
count down the days until the catwalks kick
in, I find myself agonizing over the future of
high-end fashion and grieving for one of the
industry’s most talented creative geniuses.
The scandal that erupted just under a year
ago concerning anti-Semitic remarks made
by John Galliano (former Creative Director
at Christian Dior) sent a tornado through the
industry and has since become a story deeply
carved into the gilt-edged history books of
fashion.
house that does not bear their own
name must not only have a definite
knowledge of the history and culture of the
brand, but also their own vision which must
inspire and convince consumers of the next
generation that their designs will endure, just
like the illustrious name of Christian Dior.
The despairing answer that I must postulate
is that the majority of customers who fund
these labels no longer care about the design-
ers behind the house’s name. Rather than
relish in the artistic talent and craftsmanship
of the garment they don, they care only that
its price tag is beyond what their dry cleaner
earns in half a year and that upon removing
their plush coat, their contemporaries’ butlers
will see a famous brand name sewn into the
nape of the silk-satin lining.
As far as I’m concerned, this must be con-
sidered to be fashion sacrilege. Though it
seems that the opinion of the nouveau riche
with their glimmering Chanel sunglasses,
monogrammed Louis Vuitton bags and jewel
coloured Gucci fur coats couldn’t care less
about Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs or Frida
Giannini and co, let alone the disgraced and
fallen John Galliano. As long as they feel that
what they’re wearing is distinctively covet-
able, to them, nothing else matters. And that,
my dearest fashion lovers, is most definitely
something to grieve about.

The forgotten designer
As the luxury market continues to profit, Alice Yang questions what lies
beneath the consumer’s desire for labels
Spring Term Dates
Are you enthused by cutting-
edge design, exquisite detail
and the sheer extravagance
of the fashion world? Are
you looking for an outlet to
express your own creativity?
Do you consider yourself to
be as ‘chic and fabulous’ as
Coco Chanel? Even if not,
FashionSoc is definitely the
society for you to kick start
the fashionable chapter of
your life.
For many, fashion may
seem like a waste of space: Why spend your energy,
time and money on buying or designing innovative
exciting creations for them just to be considered
blasé in a few months time? Although in the eyes
of most, it would be a complete fabrication to say
that high-end fashion is practical, let alone an
indispensable component of our everyday lives,
the intrinsic worth of fabulous clothing, howev-
er, lies in the pleasure of the aesthetics and
the persona they create. In fact the power of
clothing far greater than your average person could
ever imagine because if correctly composed, one
outfit can change who you are to the world. As Adam
Gallagher (blogger, stylist) put it, “What you wear is
how you present yourself to the world, especially to-
day, when human contacts are so quick. Fashion is
instant language.”
This month will mark the rebirth of FashionSoc.
A new enthusiastic committee has formed, and we
are working hard to restore the society and save it
from dormancy. To make up for lost time, we are or-
ganising as many workshops, events and socials as
possible, so the rest of this term is jam-packed with
creative activities. On top of this we are giving our
members the opportunity to experience the fashion
world through trips to exhibitions and shows, be-
cause the best way to learn to is be well-informed in
the work of others.
Our aim for FashionSoc is to provide members
with the opportunity to learn a variety of design and
making techniques in our weekly workshops that
will run from February 14 where we will be decorat-
ing masks in RSM G1, (and will occur every Tuesday
evening 6:30-8:30 henceforth). We are also looking
to put on our own fashion show in May and are look-
ing for creative talent and enthusiasm to fuel it. So,
regardless of if your style is flamboyant and wacky
or classic and under-stated, as long as you’re pas-
sionate, then we would love to have you on board.
If interested, join our Facebook group and mailing
lists for regular updates.
