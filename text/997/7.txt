Previous years have seen Imperial College
dominate the university rowing scene in Britain.
The Head Season of 1994 was no exception.
After successive wins in all categories at
Peterborough, Reading, Kingston and the
National Indoor Rowing Championships,
Imperial College Boat Club were poised for a
favourable Head Of The River result.
Quality crews from as far afield as Spain,
Italy, Germany and Switzerland contributed to a
record entry of 480 men's Eights. The forecast
was a gruelling battle against stiff competition.
On 26th March, the world's largest single boat
race got underway and 3400 rowers put
themselves and other competitors to the test. It's a
perilous 18 minutes to the finishing post; pacing
yourself at the start is all important. Imperial
College were mentioned in the BBC's coverage
of the event, including the fifth Eight who were
unfortunate in being the last crew to start.
Good results? Well, judge for yourself:
Crew Position
Imperial 1 7th - winners of
Senior 1 category
Imperial 2 15th - winners of
Senior 2 category
Imperial 3 56th - 3rd place in
Senior 3 category
Imperial 4 79th - winners of
Novice category (by
25 seconds)
Imperial 5 120th - 3rd place in
Novice category
ICBC lst - winners of most
pennants

The Easter break saw the Boat Club embark
on a successful training camp in Spain. Spanish
television saw IC field an Eight for the
International Student Regatta in Barcelona.
Although lacking in experience, they showed
real determination, coming second only to the
German World Student Games Crew by half a
length.
The turn of the season also sees novice
rowers emerging from the 'Bill Mason School of
Excellence' into the top squad crews, high-
lighting the club's ability to train athletes to a
high standard, as opposed to simply shipping
them in. For this, we thank coaches: Bill Mason,
Scoot, Karl Foreman and Nick Wilde, who never
failed to equal our mileage in their launches.
As attention draws on to the summer regattas
leading to Henley, training carries on as normal,
if anything more intensely because, at IC, the
boaties know that winning isn't everything - it's
the only thing.
