potato-cauliflower curry and a cucumber dip. (Each recipe serves 4 people.)
Potato-Cauliflower Curry (Alu-Gobi)
Ingredients:
• 1 small cauliflower
• 2 medium-sized potatoes
• Jeera (cummin) powder *
• Haldi (turmeric) powder *

• Ginger (ground or fresh)
• Available in supermarkets, eg
Sainsburys and Asian food shops.
Method:
1. Cut the potatoes and
cauliflower into small chunks.
2. In a wok (or a saucepan, but a
wok gives better results), put 3
tablespoons of cooking oil.
3. Heat up the oil. When hot, add
1 teaspoon of whole cummin.
When the cummin starts to
sizzle, reduce the heat.
4. Add the cauliflower and
potatoes to the wok and stir
gently. Put the lid on the wok
but stir occasionally.

the cauliflower and potatoes are
a bit soft) add 2 teaspoons of
ginger, 1 teaspoon of turmeric,
2 teaspoons of cummin powder.
6. Add some green chillies and
salt to taste.
7. Stir well for about two minutes,
being careful not to break up
the potatoes.
8. Add half a cup of water.
9. Cover the wok and stir
occasionally for three to four
minutes.
10. Serve hot immediately with
chapatti or rice.
