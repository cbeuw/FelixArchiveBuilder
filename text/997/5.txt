New Wor(l)d Order
I think I have used my last neuron. There are no
more connections to be made in my head. Either
this or I am going insane. Insanity seems to run in
my family. We don't have the usual assortment of
fruitcakes. Our family have taken to insanity with
the same dignity that one takes to satellite
television. See? I'm not making sense at all. I
have lost all sense of direction and purpose. What
was I saying? Oh, yes. M y family's insanity. It
now seems fashionable for any relative over the
age of fifty to lose 'the plot'. What an excellent
phrase that is. I wonder if you really do lose some
plot of land somewhere. Now that would mean
that my family has, by now, forsaken a land mass
roughly equivalent to Alaska.
Not content with letting the oldies have all
the fun, my sister has got in on the act. She is on
the verge of a nervous breakdown. She couldn't
even have the decence to do something original
like...well I don't know...if I suggest something
it wouldn't be original. I suppose that's a kind of
paradox. Some action is only original if it has
never been done. Thus an action performed is
immediately no longer original. So, nothing is
indeed original any more. Well I guess you can't
blame people for trying.
My insanity is a direct result of living for too
long. I think I've actually lived, drunk from the
cup of life and showered in the bathroom of
experience. But do not be envious. The problem
with absorbing life, like I claim to have done, is
that your mind is only a finite storage device, so
if you increase the amount of data accepted per
unit time without first increasing the size of the
storage device it will fill up as a function of the
degree of absorption. M y advice to all of you is
to cease taking in all but the knowledge you
consider to be absolutely vital. Forget
everything you learnt at school and concentrate
on the important things in life.
But what is important? Remember to feed the
cat. But what was my cat's name? 'Cat' is a
good functional name. I only have one cat, so
the name is unique. But will my flatmates object
to me referring to them by appearance and not
by anything more personal? "Good morning,
long-haired veterinary student, would you like a
cup of tea?" There, that seems mannerly enough.
But do I need to remember what subject they
do? Does the person change? I think not. So,
everything will be judged by physical
appearance and not by role or actions, this will
become my creed. A new word order.
"Hello man wearing black uniform and
carrying a truncheon, can you please direct me
to the nearest tube station as I seem to be in an
advanced state of intoxication?"
