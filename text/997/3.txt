Reckless Behaviour
by ICU President
BY MIKE INGRAM
AND LYNN BRAVEY
New scandal is surrounding
Imperial College Union President,
Andrew Wensley.
Late on Tuesday evening, he
was found in the committee room
of IC Radio's Southside Studio.
James Handley, Station Manager,
described him as being in a drunken
state, "more than slightly doped up"
and behaving in a "paranoid" man-
ner.
After assessing the President's
condition as reasonably harmless,
Mr Handley began closing down
the station for the night. On return-
ing to the committee room he was
confronted by Mr Wensley stagger-
ing around the room with a chair
raised above his head.
Following some discussion, Mr
Wensley threw the chair down in
front of him, an action that could
easily have damaged either the
photocopier or computer, both of
which were in the room.
Mr Handley and the other IC
Radio members in the station at the
time "proceeded to evict him [Mr
Wensley] from the station". The
station door was then locked behind
him, though he was said to have
continued to cause a disturbance
outside for some time afterwards.
Twenty minutes later, when the
station was eventually locked up
and Mr Handley left the premises,
Mr Wensley was no longer there.
On questioning M r Wensley
about the incident, he stated that he
had earlier attended a whisky tast-
ing session at the Holland Club and
described himself as being "drunk"
by the end of the evening.
Mr Wensley confirms that, on
his way back home to Linstead
Hall, he went into IC Radio, but he
declined to comment further on his
activities.
