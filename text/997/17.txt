18 Opinion
Editorial
Free Press.
The letter below suggests that views condoning
murder have no place in the free press. The
expression 'free press' to me implies that there
are no restrictions (other than legal ones) on
what views are held by contributors.
One of the aims of Felix is to give people a
platform on which to air their views. The only
reason why I would not publish such a letter
would be if it was anonymous. I do not see that
Felix should allow people to express their views
without having the guts to put their names to
them.
What's the point in a letters page if I turn
around to people and say: "Oh, sorry, I can't let
you express that opinion because it might offend
someone." By their nature, opinions are going to
be disagreed with by people. If someone is
willing to put their views on the line and express
them through Felix, then all well and good. At
least it's sparking off a debate, which is

Murder Was
Condoned?
Dear Beccy,
I was disturbed to see the letter of Yassar
Hatami published in last week's Felix. In this
letter the opinion that "it is unjust to see Salman
Rushdie in hiding" is attacked, on the grounds
of the insulting nature of the book 'The Satanic
Verses'. In doing this it is clearly implied that
the current terrorism directed against M r
Rushdie is justified.
Whilst I expect some people to hold this
view I do not expect to see them in print in
Felix. Expressions of views condoning murder
ought to have no place in the free press. I hope
that the letters publication was just a slip.
Yours faithfully,
Robert Munro

something that people claim has been lacking in
Felix in the past.
Setting An Example?
So, what has our President been up to? Drinking
too much whisky and then trashing IC Radio by
the sounds of it. He sat in a corner and pulled
record sleeves over himself from the shelves
above, as well as throwing a chair about and he
tore a cardboard box into shreds (or so it has
been claimed!). Very responsible behaviour for
one of the highest ranking people in the Union...
Editors Wanted
Don't forget that, as well as the need for a new
Handbook Editor, the Union still needs an
Alternative Prospectus Editor. If you are
interested in pointing out all the faults of
Imperial College to prospective students, contact
Greg lies, c/o Pub Board Exec Pigeonholes,
Union Office.
Handbook Editor Wanted
You have to gather the material,
obtain advertising, chase clubs for
submissions. You are responsible for
the creation of the Handbook: how it
looks and what it contains.
But don't panic! Whilst it may
seem a big job, there are plenty of
people around to give you advice and
assistance. And don't forget that the
work have to do over the summer is
paid.
Sounds interesting? Then see Andy
Wensley (Union Office) for more
details.
