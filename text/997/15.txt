President Garfield's American Scream
"Iron will, iron hand, neck like a tyre, iron man, iron bar, metal band,
pumping iron man." So said Juliana Hatfield of the one-time Henry Garfield.
To the world he is now Henry Rollins, ex-leader of the seminal hardcore
band, turned book publisher and raconteur, Tintin braces his hatches...
Waiting in a B M G conference room with a
ragged group of journalists, my first experience
of Rollins is as I go out to get a coke. On the
other side of the door is a surprisingly small, if
rather broad, figure. Even with his multiple
tattoos and close cropped hair, it's an anticlimax.
I expected him to be something more than just
over-sized normality. When talking he seems to
be slightly ill at ease, which is weird because he
has spent the last year doing his 'Spoken Word'
shows and that was in front of thousands. There
he was in one of his element by all accounts,
but maybe that was real life and this is
banal promotion, which is the
musician's bane. Yet 90
minutes later he is still
going on strong,
answering even the
boring questions, and
making them worth-
while.
Articulate, funny
and very aware,
Rollins is holding the
dying pulse of urban
America. He has
something to say and
do. Open up to
reality.
"It's heading
towards a cross-
roads. It's gonna get
so bad that some-
thing's gonna have
to give and I think
before it goes all the
way down the
tubes...it's gonna
take a lot of dead
people for everyone
to go: 'What are we
doing with these guns?'
I think heterosexual people are
going to have to start getting AIDS and
dying...Barbra Streisand's gonna have to die
and then the Government will go: 'We have a
cure for AIDS' because there'll be enough rich
people who can afford to pay Du Pont out the
butt to buy the medication. I'm sure the cure is
sitting somewhere right now, they're just
waiting for enough people to have the money to
buy it and right now it's all those undesirable
types like junkies and gay people who can't pay,
so Lilly or Du Pont can't make the money yet.
So I think you're gonna see a lot more
horrific sh*t before there's any signs where you
sitting here [in Britain] can see on the news
things are getting better, but 24 hours a day,
95% of the American population is really
cool...all you need is 5%, the asshole 5% factor
Barbra Streisand's
gonna have to die
and you got a nation paranoid. And I think the
Government helps reinforce stereotypes like:
'blackman bad, whiteman good, cop good,
Rodney King bad. You know if a cop
beats the sh*t out of someone, six
weeks in jail. If a bunch of black
guys beat up a
be 'bye-bye'
San Quentin in
like...they'd be inside a
block of ice with Sylvester
Stallone like 'Demolition Man'...it would have
been a different story, everybody knows it, so I
think things are gonna get really hairy. There's
gonna be some real atrocities before it gets
better. America just doesn't look at its backyard,
that's the problem. It's too busy fronting the
cool thing - ' W e ' l l help you little starving
nation'. Man, you ought to go to America, walk
through New York, see every other person has a
paper cup, jiggling quarters like 'hey man I'm
starving' every other person and you're like 'I
got no more money' and they'll follow you.
'Hey man, I know you got some money'.
They're desperate, they're f**king starving. You
got Vietnam Veterans who can't get any health
care; it's crazy. And at the same time there's
Michael Jackson, $60 million; Madonna, $60
million. Ten kilometres down
the highway from where she
lives it looks like Lebanon on
a bad day. Compton is
unbelievable. It looks like a
scene from 'Blade Runner'
There's a death count up
every Sunday, a weekend
goes by and there's like...
Teenagers, these kids don't
even shave, they can't even
drive but they can shoot.
They can't read but they can
shoot."
That was straight off,
almost without a breath,
from the question: "Would
you say America is heading
towards self destruction?"
If anyone is wrestling
with the demons of the
United States of America,
it's the boy who got beaten
up at school in 1968, for
"killing Martin Luther
K i n g " (ie being white).
And that is why he is
important, because he
demonstrates that there is a
way out of the ghetto which
isn't a wooden box. When
he talks about the young black
male being a hunted person he
talks the same language as Ice-T and
Ice-Cube. Except then he goes on to
reject the use of firearms.
That Henry Rollins isn't head of some white
supremist terror machine is amazing. That he is
one of the most focussed, dedicated human
being on the planet is not short of unique.
President Garfield? Just tell me where to put the
cross.
Freedom? You can't handle freedom, you're dying for it
