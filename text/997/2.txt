The Sandwich Shop on Gloucester Road, damaged byfire last weekend
BY LYNN BRAVEY
The Sandwich Shop on Gloucester
Road was closed at the start of this
week causing great distress to many
of the students of Imperial College.
A fire broke out on the premises
on Sunday night, causing signifi-
cant damage. It was thought to have
been started by an electrical fault.

A new ethanol fermentation process
developed at Imperial College may
make it possible to turn waste straw
into 'biofuel', with major implica-
tions for renewable energy sources
in the future.
Agricultural waste is a major
problem for farmers, particularly in
the EC where burning straw is ille-
gal. The straw can be converted into
paper pulp, but this is uneconomical
since it produces highly polluting
waste products.
One solution would be to fer-
ment these waste products into
ethanol, which could then be used
A sales assistant, who was inside
the shop when the fire broke out,
raised the alarm. He ran across the
road to the Harrington Arms Pub to
alert the fire brigade and a fire
engine was at the scene in a matter
of minutes.
Much of the damage caused was
superficial and the shop manager
declared that the Sandwich Shop
as a renewable fuel for cars.
However, conventional yeasts can-
not affect such crude mixtures of
farm waste.
Researchers at Imperial College's
Centre for Biotechnology have
found a way to convert the mixtures
into ethanol both quickly and effi-
ciently. The process depends on
metabolically and genetically engi-
neered bacteria, similar to the kind
found on garden compost heaps.
Biofuels such as ethanol are
already used in countries like Brazil
and the United States but, until
now, such projects have not been
economically viable. The new tech-
nique should cut the cost of ethanol
would be trading as normal "as of
Friday morning".
The shop, which sells it's sand-
wiches at half price after 4pm, is
used by many students. With the
re-opening comes a special offer
available to all Imperial College
students. Sandwiches will be half
price all day for the next two weeks.
production considerably.
Dr Namdar Baghaei-Yazdi, who
recently won an important
European award for his work on the
project, says: "This process could
revolutionise the energy and fuel
industry as there are mountains of
agricultural and industrial wastes
that are potential feedstocks for our
process."
The process is being adapted for
commercial use by a biotechnology
company called Agrol. "Hopefully
we will have the first pilot plant
operating within three to four
years," says Dr Baghaei-Yazdi.
Union
Matters
The Imperial College Union
Handbook Editor has resigned. The
Union Office Sabbaticals and the
Events & Marketing Manager are
currently dealing with the pressing
matters to do with the publication.
A new Editor is currently being
sought and anyone interested
should speak to Andy Wensley,
I C U President. The job would
involve some work during the rest
of this term and the remainder of
the work being done over the sum-
mer vacation (for which a nominal
salary is paid).
The Jazz & Rock practice room
has now been closed following
complaints from residents of Beit
Hall {Felix 986). Plans were dis-
cussed at the Executive Committee
meeting last Tuesday to transfer
Rag and the Operatic Society to
different premises and use these
rooms for Jazz and Rock Club.
The next Union General
Meeting is to be held on Friday
20th May at 1pm.
Haagen-
Dazs
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Crowds of people were seen queu-
ing outside the new Haagen-Dazs
ice cream parlour on Bank Holiday
Monday awaiting its first full day
of trading.
The shop on Gloucester Road
opened up for a trial run on Sunday
evening for a few hours. The shop's
manager said that trade has been
"pretty good" so far with lots of
tourists during the day and mainly
young people during the evening.
The official opening was yester-
day and free samples were being
given out from a cart outside the
shop. Two girls could be seen
roller-skating down Gloucester
Road and O l d Brompton Road
giving out coupons which offered
'two scoops for the price of one'. A
jazz band entertained the customers
in the evening.
The parlour is open seven days a
week from 9am to 11pm, and prices
start from Â£1.20.
