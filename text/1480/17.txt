COMMENT
I
try not to listen to BBC Radio
if I can help it, because I want
old age to hold some surprises
and given that I already eat mint
imperials all day and complain
about ‘the youth’I’m feeling that it’s not
holding much back.
Last week a friend linked me to a
radio segment that involved Michael
Gove, current education secretary and
former Elmer Fudd impersonator, going
toe-to-toe with a listener calling in to a
Radio 5 discussion on education. Being
the classy sort of guy that he apparently
is, Gove cut the man off, misinterpreted
most of his remarks, and stalled more
than a <car brand> in a <weather type>.
The conversation was about the usual
petty stuff like the education of a na-
tion’s children, but Gove’s lack of pro-
fessionalism was remarkable. The man’s
running a section of our government.
His desk probably has tiny red buttons
on it that cause things to explode when
pressed.
The button he’s been mashing lately
is the one about education reform. The
soundbite Gove attempted to manufac-
ture was that he wanted more ‘facts’ in
education; the flaw being that not only
does this sound massively idiotic, but
once you get past the “I guess that’s bet-
ter than teaching stuff we made up on the
commute in to work, Mr. Gove” stage of
comprehension, you realise what he ac-
tually means: learning by rote.
Gove’s noticed that children from
other countries are outperforming Brit-
ish children and has decided that the an-
swer to this is to emulate their education
system entirely. Although apparently he
may be taking it slightly too far, as in
December he wrote that “like Chairman
Mao, we’ve embarked on a Long March
to reform our education system”. I’m as-
suming he won’t be actually murdering
teachers in the street like Mao did.
I don’t think anyone would disagree
with Gove’s appraisal of the current sit-
uation. Our children are, on the whole,
not performing as well as the best in
other countries. There are a lot of fac-
tors affecting this, but before we go off
investigating them and trying to emulate
the education policies of infamous com-
munist revolutionaries it might be wise
to ask whether we want to have their
education systems.
India’s engineering industry is taking
off in a big way. Everything from soft-
ware to civil via aeronautics - you name
it, they’ve got a university producing
students as good as Imperial’s or bet-
ter. Two, three, four years ago this was
big news, and people were talking about
the rise of their university system like
it was the future. That’s calmed down a
bit lately, however, as more and more of
their graduates reach the workplace and
people notice an unusual trend - a lot of
them don’t really want to be there.
I’m not an education theorist, but I
do know that the reason the teachers’
unions want relaxed curriculums is be-
cause it allows creativity on the part of
teachers, and exploration on the part of
students. Both of these things allow for
children to find their place in the world
and do a job they really want to.
Anyway, hopefully that answers all
those dozens of emails I get asking for
my opinion on education reform in the
post-Labour United Kingdom. Next
week on Angry University: could the
Israel-Palestine conflict have been re-
solved by stealing everyone’s maps and
refusing to give them back?
T
he audience were in com-
plete silence for 64 min-
utes. Everyone was hang-
ing onto every single word
that Lilly Ebert, a Holo-
caust survivor, spoke. Her story is an-
other one of the countless testimonies
we have all been listening to since the
survivors vouched to share their stories
again and again so that we could prevent
something so tragic, so monstrous, so
inhumane from ever happening again.
Have we learned our lesson though?
What one might see in Mrs Ebert is a
woman who shall not be silenced – we
admire her bravery and courage to speak
through her tears about the horrors of
Auschwitz and concentration camps
alike. She stands as living proof of what
Europe and the rest of the world allowed
happen in the 1940s. One might argue
that there was nothing that could have
been done, that Hitler could not have
been stopped. I disagree, and wish to
share with you why.
War has been a constant theme in my
life. I was born in Sarajevo in 1989 and
when the war started in 1992, I was for-
tunate enough to escape with my mother
and two siblings to Split in Croatia and
then to New York. My father stayed and
fought in the war and was wounded
three times. I remember going back a
year after the war ended and seeing bul-
let and grenade holes in every building
in my home town, I remember the story
of my first cousin being shot on the bat-
tlefront, my best friend’s recollection of
her elder brother and aunt being hit by
a grenade, children being warned not
to enter abandoned homes or to go into
mine fields (this is still a major problem
in Bosnia today). Now that I think of it,
my grandfather was sent off to a concen-
tration camp in the Balkans – Jasenovac
– during WWII. I never met him. You
get the idea.
Now, that paragraph was not written
to ask for pity, but rather for your empa-
thy and compassion for today’s victims.
I’d like to evoke your understanding and
recognition of what had happened and
what is happening now. I cannot even
begin to imagine the horrors that Lilly
Ebert went through, but I realize that we
have not quite learned our lesson.
Lilly Ebert left the packed lecture the-
atre with the following:
“It was an upside-down world where
good was bad and bad was good – what
do I mean by this? Killing someone was
accepted and helping someone was pun-
ished. When you came out of this world
[Auschwitz], you had no money, no
education, no anything, and you had to
begin a new life. Not a lot of books were
written about that. Not that many peo-
ple stayed normal. That is my story…it
makes no difference what religion you
are, what colour your skin happens to
be, because tolerance is important…You
should know what has happened, what
can happen and you need to look out so
that it never happens again.”
Some of you might remember the
Bosnian Genocide in July 1995. One
of the reasons that it wasn’t worse was
because the world had learned part of
the lesson from the Holocaust, however
morbid that might sound. Unfortunately,
this lesson didn’t help the Srebrenica
victims. “Da se ne zaboravi (May it [the
genocide] never be forgotten)” – the
message of the Srebrenica survivors
echoes in my mind. Rwanda, Sudan,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Sri Lanka,
Kashmir, Tibet, Czeczenia, Armenia
(please do forgive me if I have uninten-
tionally left out some)... All those names
speak for themselves.
Still, I cannot help but see the irony in
Mrs Ebert’s recount – “I hope we stick
to that promise,” she said. What has hap-
pened in the past 66 years? It is extreme-
ly important that each and every one of
us know these stories, repeat them and
pledge to ourselves to never allow for
them to be forgotten. How many more
times does history have to repeat itself?
Learning lessons from the past
“I remember going
back a year after
the war ended and
seeing bullet and
grenade holes in
every building.”
“Gove’s lack of
professionalism was
remarkable.”
You’ve chosen to
be here, so quit
whining
Gove’s in charge? Seriously?
“I have so much work! I hate
Imperial!” Heard this before?
Mmm... I thought so - there
is a lot of this Imperial hate
around. The same university
that everyone has chosen to
attend also appears to be the
root of all of their misfortunes
and unhappiness.
This viewpoint is flawed and
unhealthy in a number of ways.
The most obvious comment to
make is that university is not
in any way compulsory, and be-
ing in one of the world’s best
is a fantastic opportunity. I
don’t see how anyone could
accept a place at a university
in which they don’t want to be.
I mean the choice was always
yours.
Imperial is not something
to hate, because in essence
it is not a thing; it is an in-
stitution within which people
can further their knowledge
of science, engineering and
medicine. I may be being a bit
pompous here, but the point is
that there is nothing to hate. I
don’t really see Imperial as a
big monster trying to force any-
one to join or to do anything
actually. If you don’t want to
work you can choose not too.
The place should not be de-
monised, as it is the people
themselves that make it what
it is.
Fundamentally it must not
be the centre of the student’s
universe. We live in London af-
ter all. Don’t you think a lot of
people would find themselves
quite content studying in one
of the world’s ten best univer-
sities whilst living in central
London?
This brings me to my final
point, a place to study at Im-
perial College is worth a lot.
I’m not talking about money,
even though it IS very expen-
sive. For every student here
there is probably at least one
other that has been left to find
somewhere else to study. So if
you don’t want to be here, let
someone who does take your
place.
No one likes working as such
but that doesn’t excuse hating,
or pretending to hate, a place
where we’ve all chosen to be.
