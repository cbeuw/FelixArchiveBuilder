Scorpio
This week you’re a London bus driver,
one day from retirement. At the penul-
timate stop on your final journey you
stop to pick up some heroin junkies who
don’t have the correct fare. You refuse to
let them on and they stab you with their
needles. You die of AIDS.

Horoscopes
Aries
This week you have sex. Afterwards,
you steal the used condom that your
Taurus boyfriend put in the bin, invert in
over your hand like a glove and ram it up
your vagina in an attempt to get the baby
you’ve always wanted. You’re a bad, bad
woman.
Taurus
This week you catch your Aries girl-
friend fisting herself with an inverted
used condom. In an attempt to save your
life you hire Chuck Norris to round-
house kick her in the stomach, killing
her instantly and taking the child with it.
That’ll teach her.
Gemini
This week you put your head in a bottle
bank for jokes, you crazy lad! Your head
gets stuck and your friends run off and
leave you. At this point a gang of sex-
starved neo-Nazi zombies arrive and they
take turns to penetrate you, until you die
from blood loss.
Cancer
This week you make a concoction of your
body fluids in an ill-thought-out attempt
to find the fountain of youth. Your mum
walks in to find you covered in semen,
earwax and chunder, and decides to have
you put down. Your brother inherits your
Game Boy.
Leo
This week you exchange masturbation
tips with your Virgo friend who tells you
to sit in the bath and place a wingless fly
on your penis and watch it run around.
The fly crawls into your jap’s eye and
lays its eggs. You come maggots. You
win the grand prize.
Virgo
This week you exchange masturbation
tips with your Leo friend who tells you
to insert your thumb into your anus while
masturbating. Your thumb gets stuck,
your Catholic dad walks in, then you
drown yourself out of shame after he
finishes you off.
Libra
This week you do a Felix centrefold with
a young man of questionable age. When
the feds find out they arrest you, but in-
stead of locking you up they hire you to
seduce young male assassins. You get the
first ‘licence to paedo’. You’re a bad, bad
woman.
Sagittarius
This week you cover your testicles with
peanut butter before summoning your
dog. It all goes a bit too far and your sack
gets split open. As you scrape together
your non-salvageable bloody remains
from the floor you realise that the dog is
actually your dad.
Capricorn
This week you smoke pot for the first
time, but little do you know that it was
laced with crack. After one toke you
become instantly hooked and only
fixated with getting your next fix. To fuel
your gruesome habit you offer hand jobs
outside the SAF to innocent Biologists.
Aquarius
This week you decide to fight the
power and drop out of university. But
unfortunately the lifestyle isn’t as
glamorous as you imagined, and you’re
still confined to a life of ready meals, free
view porn and social ineptness. You’re
still the biggest loser you know.
Pisces
This week you get a leading role in
Swan Lake! After dabbling with ecstasy,
bulimia, self-harm and lesbianism, you
give a blinding performance on opening
night, but instead of hooking up with
Mila Kunis you decide to kill yourself on
stage. WHAT THE FUCK, NATALIE?

method of shooting up
DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
This might look like two girls who have had too much to drink and have passed out on the floor. However, this is
in fact a photo of two girls who have had too much to drink but don’t have friends to take them home...
