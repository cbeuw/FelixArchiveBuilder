FILM
The actor who plays the hero off-screen
instead of on – Ian Somerhalder
Saphira Gurski
When you think of American film, gos-
sip mags overflowing with Hollywood
hunks immediately pop to mind. The
UK has a thriving indie and dramatic
scene, however we thought it was high
time to flag some rising Hollywood stars
(and their films/shows) who deserve to
be on your radar. Who are we kidding?
This liberal newspaper needs more
than naturist-inspired weekly center-
folds to sate a college-level appetite for
eye-candy. It’s relatively easy to find
mouthwateringly sexy Hollywood ac-
tors, however when considering what
ancillary characteristics might intrigue
our science, tech and business-oriented
student body, Ian Somerhalder easily
tops the list. Your blank stare, squeals
of “Boone” (Lost), or drool pooling on
your well-worn copy of Entertainment
Weekly’s Sexiest Beast issue slots you
into either the uninitiated or swooning
fan category.
Somerhalder’s current fan-fave sexy
beast Damon Salvatore (of hit US
show The Vampire Diaries) won. Hey,
you must be doing something right if
you’ve managed to take the New York
Post PopWrap’s Best of 2010 Television
No. 1 rank, as judged by a full-blooded
male TV critic! Not Twilight nor overly
teen girl-oriented, if you can bury your
fear of the undead for an hour, “TVD”
and the deliciously conflicted, psycho-
pathically unstable and eternally sarcas-
tic “knight in tarnished armor” Damon
Salvatore is not to be missed. However,
it’s not only Somerhalder’s compelling
and often eerie performance, sugges-
tive of future box office potential à la
Johnny Depp, which convinced us to do
a profile. If you’re in the mood to dive
into the indie and smaller budget drama
flicks Somerhalder’s acted in, you’re in
for a treasure-trove full of sexy and hi-
larious moments. Our favorites are The
Rules of Attraction, Life As A House
and Wake.
The Rules of Attraction is a delight-
fully dark and twisted satire of univer-
sity life. Amongst an ensemble of drug-
addled, sexually promiscuous misfits,
Somerhalder plays a disaffected, cynical
bisexual student dealing with the harsh
realities of a straight crush. Highlights
include the most sexy and hilarious
method of an undressed male select-
ing an outfit in digital existence. Best
watched with your girl/boyfriend; this
edgy, extremely liberal flick just can’t
stop flaunting everything from straight
sex, to male-on-male action, to a house
full of naked ladies.
Life As A House is a surprisingly
quirky, humorous, sad and profound tale
about a terminally ill architect searching
for the existential meaning of his life
by constructing his dream home along-
side his drug-addicted son (Star Wars’
Hayden Christensen). Somerhalder’s
roaring entrance in a red Porsche cata-
lyzes the story’s abrupt departure from
emo-fest to hilariously dark as his cocky
pimp/drug dealer character rips through
the veil of the film’s seemingly idyllic
neighborhood via activities like an on-
going tryst with the local cougar.
Wake is an indie romcom with drama/
gothic/thriller overtones that led the
Cinequest Film Festival’s opening night.
Somerhalder plays the widow-with-
a-secret of a mysteriously deceased
woman and the new love interest of a
dark, quirky girl who attends strangers
funerals to entertain herself. Hilarious
romantic and murder investigation hi-
jinks ensue.
Somerhalder’s performance doesn’t
rely on his trademark sultry stare. He

has a peculiar quirk, adding character
through facial micro expressions and
eyebrows with a life of their own. Per-
haps this is why he’s won over critics
and was nominated for Best Drama Ac-
tor in the People’s Choice Awards. Or
maybe it’s because he’s one of a only
handful of actors who can pull off the
“sympathetic murder,” ripping charac-
ters’ hearts out. By hand. (Recall: Emmy
nods to Dexter). Most actors play hero
on screen, however Somerhalder favours
the antagonist. Chances are, it’s because
he has a hero complex in real life.
He recently started the Ian Somerhal-
der Foundation (ISF) to foster youth-led
awareness initiatives within the realms
of animal welfare, environmental issues
and clean energy as well as to “fund ap-
plications and sources for green energy.”
He’s personally involved in a green pow-
er entrepreneurial venture (Go Green
Mobile Power). He became quite a large
presence within social and mainstream
US media this past year due to his vocal
statements and awareness-raising dur-
ing the BP Gulf Oil Spill. Inspiring and
collaborating with an increasingly large
set of fan-initiated awareness and fun-
draising groups, he’s also spoken on a
panel at the Washington Energy Summit
and, as a spokesperson for the Alliance
for Global Conservation, will be going
on a mission to Central America to as-
sess environmental issues which he’ll
present to Congress in autumn 2011.

“Gutsy” Black Swan should get Best Picture
Ed Knock
It’s all too was easy to say that this
year’s Oscars is going to be exciting
but I do believe that the 51st Acad-
emy Awards are going to be a bit spe-
cial. Whereas previous years have been
dominated by a few strong contenders
( There Will be Blood and No Coun-
try For Old Men 2007) or a weak field
(2006) or just ridiculous hysteria for
one film (Slumdog Millionaire, 2009),
this season’s Oscars have few clear
favourites.
The Best Picture category is definitely
an open race with the possibility of ten
films (enlarged last year) taking home
the prized statuette. See-Saw Films will
be hoping that their ‘British charm’ will
help them edge out main competition
The Social Network who claimed vic-
tory at the Golden Globes. In reality
127 hours and True Grit, although nomi-
nated, will be out of the running due
to their director’s previous successes
last decade. I predict The Fighter will
triumph on the night, everyone knows
Hollywood loves a good boxing film
(the travesty being when Rocky beat
Taxi Driver to the 1976 best picture
award) and it’s a classic American story
of a working class man overcoming his
demons to become a champion. Person-
ally I would love it if Black Swan won
Best Picture, it’s simply an incredibly
gutsy piece of filmmaking both terrify-
ing and sexy at the same time and Dar-
ren Aronofsky is due some recognition
from the Academy.
Colin Firth is clear favourite for best
actor and I’m sure he will take home
the precious award in Febuary. James
Franco could upset Firth’s chances and
his performance in 127 hours could
potentially woo voters. Jeff Bridges
nomination is deserved but an actor has
never one a Oscar two years in a row.
Natalie Portman’s brilliant portrayal of a
mentally unstable ballerina may well be
the only statuette that Black Swan takes
home however Annette Bening is a dark
horse and she will be a safer option for
many voting in the Academy. Best Di-
rector? It always accompanies the best
film but here’s hoping Aronofsky will be
lucky on the night.
Oh yeh I love it! The pattern on the wall-hanging I mean...
