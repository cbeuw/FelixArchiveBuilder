Flynn. If he helps her, she will let him go.
The relationship is superbly voiced by the
two leading actors: Levi as the narcissistic but
often clueless thief and Moore as the lovable,
naïve and cute little princess. They make a
great team and there is plenty of humour be-
tween them to keep things fresh. Some jokes
are more childish and immature than others,
but there are more than enough enjoyable
developments to keep the older members of
the audience hooked. Mother Grothel, one of
Disney’s very few non-magical villains, relies
brilliantly on her master manipulation skills
and passive-aggressive words to mess with
everyone’s heads. Murphy has the perfect
voice for the role: her sly intelligence and un-
canny ability to work every single situation
to her own advantage makes her one
slick villain.

Costing Disney a whooping $260 million in
production budget alone, it comes as no sur-
prise that the studio has announced they will
no longer make animated films based on fair-
ytales after the release of their latest, Tangled.
It’s time for the original ideas of Pixar to thrive
and Disney knows it. The most recent Disney
non-Pixar efforts haven’t exactly turned huge
profits and, as the bar is continuously raised,
the cost of animation isn’t getting any cheaper.
Good news, then, that the film they’re re-
leasing as their fairytale send-off is actually
of a very high standard, mixing a well-known
children’s story with some gripping action,
adventure and song-and-dance numbers we
have all come to adore. There are the usual
Disney ingredients – a young princess in trou-
ble, a wisecracking, handsome princely man, a
wicked woman who starts off the story by cre-
ating a mess of a situation, cheery tunes, and
funny supporting characters. It’s really no dif-
ferent from many Disney classics, but Tangled
recycles this well worn-out set of plot devices
and still makes the whole film surprisingly
watchable.
First things first: the $260 million is money
well spent. Tangled looks stunning and the art-
work cannot be faulted here. It may be one of
the best looking of all Disney animated films.
Unlike Disney’s previous works, Tangled is
not a purely hand-drawn animation, but a com-
puter-animation integration that truly shows
the modern appeal.
The plot follows the classic fairytale char-
acter, Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) whose hair is
a central theme of the story and is beautifully
animated, flowing across the screen in most
scenes. When Mother Gothel (Donna Mur-
phy) discovers that the newborn baby princess
Rapunzel’s hair has a special power of heal-
ing that includes maintaining youth, Gothel
kidnaps the poor princess, locks her away in
a tower and raises the baby as her own. The
power of her hair only remains when it’s not
cut – so it’s important to grow her beautiful
long golden hair. Eighteen years later, a local
bandit, Flynn (Zachary Levi), fleeing from
some palace guards, runs into a forest,
and stumbles upon Rapunzel’s place of
imprisonment. At first, they get off to a
bad start – mainly when she attacks him
and holds him prisoner. But, when
it transpires that she is
dying to venture out
into the world, she
strikes up a deal with
come up with so many epic, catchy tunes that
it would be simply unrealistic to expect the
same sort of breakthrough musical standard,
but Tangled does come up with its fair share
of likable songs, though they’re nothing on the
enduring classics of early Disney.
There is a lot of hectic action in the middle
sequence – a lot of which is made head-spin-
ning by the eye-popping special effects. The
3D is once again not something groundbreak-
ing and doesn’t add a whole lot to the film’s
content. It’s more distracting than anything
else – Rapunzel’s hair flows swimmingly no
matter what and her big eyes sparkle even
without the added extra dimension.
Despite the directors’ attempts to be crea-
tive, the final moments are a tad daft, and the
cheesiness surrounding its finale can be un-
bearable. It doesn’t make a whole lot of
sense either, and relies on the argument
of “love conquers all” as its final mot-
to. Though it’s an easy way out, a
neat conclusion with a happy mes-
sage, something the kids will no
doubt be pleased with but most
viewers will be left wanting a
little more. Perhaps we should
all remember that this is a Dis-
ney film, and therefore, should
ultimately be kid-friendly
but Tangled is still another
demonstration that Disney
doesn’t quite get the differ-
ence between “sub-stand-
ard film” and “children’s
film”.

Classic Cinema
Jurassic Park
Considering its release in 1993, it may be a little pre-
emptive to call Jurassic Park a classic film, but after
almost twenty years of being referenced and spoofed
countless times in hundreds of other films and televi-
sion shows, I’m going to call it. From Spaced’s take
on Muldoon’s “clever girl…” line to the iconic water-
ripple shots reproduced innumerable times, this film
has become deeply ingrained in cinematic history.
Starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum
as the only people to ever make paleontonlogists
and mathematicians look badass, this film stormed
box offices to become the most financially success-
ful film of its time. And it’s easy to see why. Even
after so many years that have seen huge leaps in
CGI technology, Jurassic Park remains timeless, with
shots that are still as visually impressive now as they
were at its release. As a testament to Spielberg’s
refusal to cut corners, the painstakingly constructed
animatronic dinosaurs used for close-ups have not
aged at all.
It is typical Spielberg in every aspect, with a rous-
ing John Williams score and a character arc that
sees the gruff Dr. Alan Grant (Neill) learning to open
his heart and take responsibility for the kids left in
his care – thereby satisfying Spielberg’s incessant
daddy issues. In between the sweeping shots of
Costa Rica and the highly convincing Scientific Facts
that allow the recreation of dinosaurs to be possible,
Jurassic Park is a triumph of action and suspense.
There are few scenes more utterly nail-biting than the
‘Velociraptors In The Kitchen’ scene, which builds to
one of the finest, most impressive finales in Spiel-
berg’s career, and rounds off a spectacular cinematic
milestone of a film. Jade Hoffman
