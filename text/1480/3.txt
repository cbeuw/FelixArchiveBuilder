Lord Kerr resigns after six
years as Imperial Council Chair
Search begins for replacement
Positive
signs for
graduates
Lord Kerr, Chairman of the Imperial
College Council for over six years, in-
tends to step down in the Summer, a
staff briefing indicated. The briefing in-
cluded an announcement inviting mem-
bers of the College to encourage people
they know as suitable candidates to ex-
press interest.
John Olav Kerr, Baron Kerr of Kin-
lochard took up the post of Imperial’s
Chairman of Court and Council in Janu-
ary 2005. He was ambassador and UK
permanent representative to the EU for
five years and became Deputy Chair-
man and Senior Independent Director
of Shell. Educated in Pembroke Col-
lege, Oxford, Lord Kerr is also a Fellow
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and
had commented “to work for Imperial is
a huge honour. They are, and will stay,
second to none.”
The role of Chairman of College’s
Council is of international standing and
the person appointed will have many
contacts in the higher reaches of gov-
ernment, industry or other influential
bodies. They will be expected to lead
the Council and work with the Rector
closely in order to fulfill its responsibili-
ties regarding the governance and direc-
tion of the College.
As the search for Chairman com-
mences, speculation has arisen over
who would be appropriate to succeed
Lord Kerr. The resulting candidate will
be invited for an informal and confiden-
tial discussion with the Search Commit-
tee, which is chaired by Lord Tugend-
hat, who is the Chairman of the Imperial
College Healthcare NHS Trust and is an
external member of Council. The posi-
tion is not paid.
The Council of Imperial College is de-
fined by Royal Charter as the “govern-
ing and executive body of the College”,
responsible for finance, property, invest-
ments and general business, and for set-
ting the general strategic direction of the
institution. There are nineteen members
of Council with a majority being lay
members. The Council holds meetings
at least three times during the academic
year and are further tasked with impor-
tant decisions and recommendations in-
fluencing the appointment of high profile
positions in College, such as the Rector.
Members of the College are invited to
encourage suitable candidates to email
college.secretary@imperial.ac.uk ex-
pressing their interest by the 11th of
February. As previously, the post hopes
to attract senior and respected individu-
als with great competency in finance and
politics.

In the article entitled “Fea-
sibility of longer day called
into question” (Issue 1479 –

that Professor Julia Bucking-
ham said, “staff and students
would be expected to work
longer hours”. She actually
said that they would not. Felix
apologises for this typo. Editor
Profile: Lord Kerr Who might replace him?
Baron Kerr of Kinlochard – more
commonly known as Lord Kerr –
was born in Grantown-on-Spey,
Scotland in 1942. He was edu-
cated at Glasgow Academy and
Pembroke College, Oxford, hold-
ing honorary degrees from the
Universities of St Andrews, Aston
and Glasgow. He joined the UK
Diplomatic Service in 1966 which
included postings at the British
Embassy in Moscow, and at the
High Commission in Pakistan.
Kerr was seconded to the Trea-
sury from 1979 to 1984 and be-
came Principal Private Secretary
to two Chancellors of the Exche-
quer. He was Ambassador and
UK Permanent Representative to
the European Union from 1990 to
1995 and then became Ambassa-
dor to the US in Washington until
1997 before returning to London.
He was awarded the Most Dis-
tinguished Order of Saint Michael
and Saint George, appointed CMG,
KCMG and GCMG in 2001. He
serves in the Law and Institutions
sub committee of the EU Select
Committee in the House of Lords
and is the Chairman of the Centre
for European Reform and Vice Presi-
dent of the European Policy Centre.
He also took the role of Perma-
nent Under-Secretary at the Foreign
Office and Head of the Diplomatic
Service, after which he became
a director of Shell Transport and
Trading (now Royal Dutch Shell plc),
chairing the group of Directors. He
is now Deputy Chairman and Senior
Independent Director. Lord Kerr is a
Fellow of the Royal Society of Edin-
burgh and in 2004, he was created
a life peer as Baron Kerr of Kinlo-
chard. He later acquired the role of
Chairman of the Court and Council
of Imperial College from 2005.
A poll by the Association of Graduate
Recruiters (AGR) of 222 recruiters in
the UK reveals an 8.9% annual increase
in graduate jobs, with a forecast of a fur-
ther 3.8% increase for this year.
The survey indicates that salaries are
likely to remain static. The average sal-
ary is predicted to stay at £25,000 for an
unprecedented third year.
Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the
AGR, stated: “What tended to happen
in the past [recessions] is that employ-
ers put the brakes on, and only took their
foot off a year or two later. Then they
found they didn’t have the talent in their
organisation to cope with growth. I think
that was an important lesson that a lot of
employers learned.”
Gilleard added: “It is heartening to
see that after so many months of misery
for graduates, the job market is finally
picking up. These results signal that the
graduate market is overcoming the im-
pact of the recession and anticipating
further growth.
“However, the fact that salaries are
predicted to remain the same for a third
year and fewer employers are offering
financial incentives for graduates, is
also evidence that the demand for jobs
still greatly outstrips supply, and re-
cruiters continue to receive above and
beyond the number of applications they
require.”
Universities Minister David Willetts
said: “A degree remains a good invest-
ment in the long term and is one of the
best pathways to achieving a good job
and rewarding career.”

As the search for a new Chairman
begins, Felix decided to gaze into
its crystal ball and rather unsci-
entifically, speculate about Lord
Kerr’s successor. It is not entirely
unreasonable to imagine that it
would be a Lord or Sir – for exam-
ple, every Rector of Imperial has
been a Lord or a Sir, all except the
first, Henry Bovey (poor Henry).
So that rules out Rihanna or Ste-
phen Fry.
But the Chair can’t be any old Sir
or Lord. He or She must be “of in-
ternational standing with excellent
contacts and influence in the high-
er reaches of government, industry
or other stakeholder bodies” – that
definitely rules out Rihanna.
Lord Browne would be suitable, if
he were so inclined. Having recent-
ly completed his review into univer-
sity funding, perhaps he’s acquired
a taste for the higher education
sector. And as a former CEO of
BP and a crossbench member of
the House of Lords he certainly
fits the requirements.
It is not entirely clear if Imperial
would want such a high-profile fig-
ure, however. Of course, this is all
mere speculation. We shall see
in due course which member of
the political elite is chosen. In our
heart of hearts, we’ve still got our
fingers crossed for Rihanna.
Peut-être?
