FELIX FRIDAY 28 JANUARY 2011 33
It all looks a bit Ikea, clean sleek lines and DIY instructions

apanese food is widely associ-
ated with expensive prices and
not a lot of food. However that
doesn’t always have to be the
case. All you need to do is equip
yourself with a tube map and a willing-
ness to travel.
The best part of making your own su-
shi is that you can add any fish, seafood,
meat or vegetables - it’s completely up
to you. There are classic sushi com-
binations such as the Californian roll,
salmon skin roll and soft shell crab roll;
however nobody’s stopping you from
experimenting. You only need to make
your way down to Billingsgate at the
crack of dawn to see that there is more
to fish and seafood than Sainsbury’s
‘Fresh Fish’ counter - the word “fresh”
being the overstatement of the year, as
highlighted by Hugh Fearnley-Whit-
tingstall’s recent campaign on ‘Big Fish
Fight’. So if you fancy yellowtail tuna,
razor clam or some fatty tuna, alter the
following recipe as required, because
I’m sticking to the basic Californian roll.
Get yourself equipped with:
• A rolling mat (Makisu) *
• Nori seaweed sheets *
• 3 cups sushi rice *
• 3 ¼ cups water
• 1/3 cup rice vinegar *
• 3 tbsp sugar
• 1 tbsp salt
• Several crabsticks (defrosted)
• A semi-ripe avocado
• A cucumber
• Wasabi *
• Soy Sauce
• A sharp knife
* These products are available in Sains-
bury’s or Tesco, but you can also find
them at Japanese grocery shops such
as Japan Centre (14-16 Regent Street,
SW1Y 4PH. Nearest tube station: Pic-
cadilly Circus). Some of these items are
optional i.e. nori seaweed and a rolling
mat is not needed when making nigiri
(sushi rice topped with a slice of fish)
First, you need to prepare the sushi
rice. Rice is generally prepared with a
1:1 ratio with one part rice to one part
water. As soon as the rice begins to boil,
lower the heat and let it simmer for
20 minutes. Remove the rice from the
heat. Prepare the rice vinegar mixture
by mixing the rice vinegar, sugar and
salt together on low heat. This is added
whilst the rice is cooling. Gently add the
mixture to the rice while stirring with a
wooden spoon to evenly distribute the
mix. Fan the rice mixture to cool and re-
move the moisture of the rice, giving it
a shiny look. Now that the rice is ready,
the main ingredients can be prepared.
Split the crab sticks by pulling them
lengthways into long strips approxi-
mately half the original size. Halve the
avocado with a large knife, twisting it
around the stone to separate. Remove
the stone and cut the avocado into 1cm x
1cm long strips. Cut the cucumber into
1cm x 1cm long strips also.
Now take a sheet of nori seaweed and
place it on the rolling mat. Spread about
a cup of rice on the sheet of nori, leaving
one inch of space on the other end (see
the top right photo). The rice does not
need to be packed tightly, and should be
less than ¼ inch thick, so don’t worry
if you can see the blackness of the sea-

weed through the rice. Less is more.
Place the avocado slices on top of the
rice near the edge that does not have un-
covered nori (see photo), ensuring that
the length of the rice is covered. Add the
crabstick and cucumber strips likewise.
Now here we go with the rolling.
Slowly fold the mat over, tucking the
end of the nori to start a roll. Keep lift-
ing up the mat as you go to compress the
sushi roll. Lessen the pressure slightly to
straighten out the roll, if needed. Then
continue rolling with medium pressure
until it is complete
Remove the sushi roll from mat and
immediately cut into 6 or 8 even pieces.
Important tip: keep the knife very moist
to prevent sticking, remoistening before
each cut. Cut in one swift downward
movement. Don’t shear the sushi by
cutting to and fro, as this will lead to an
awkward shape. Turn the pieces on end
and arrange on platter.
Tip: Some sushi bars make an “inside
out” California roll. The rice is spread
all over the nori (there is no uncovered
edge as above). The nori is turned over
onto cling film so it is rice side down.
The ingredients are placed on one edge
and the roll is rolled as before. After
rolling, the roll is rolled in toasted ses-
ame seeds prior to cutting. Optionally,
flying fish roe can be used in place of
the sesame seeds (it actually tastes bet-
ter, but I can only find it at Japan Centre
and is a bit pricey).
If that all sounds a bit too much and
you’d rather be served than worked,
here are some recommended places
around London for sushi for all types of
budgets.

100 ways to eat eggs!
Actually just 3…
by George McIntyre
Apparently eggs are the ultimate fast
food. Some of you may already know
this. In fact I know one guy who eats
scrambled eggs nearly everyday. Good
effort, Steve!
Anyway, the fact is they are high in
protein, low in fat and carbohydrates
and therefore very good for you! Here
are three simple recipes that will get
even the worst cooks of you making
eggs like a pro.
Poached egg
The simplest of the eggs in my opinion,
all you need here is a fresh egg, some
vinegar and a little bit of hot water.
Boil some water and pour about 3-
4cm into a pan and heat until just boiled.
Make sure to add a good glug of vin-
egar – this is very, very important!
Now add your eggs and turn the heat
right down.
Cook to your preference. If you like it
runny, it will take about 2-3 minutes and
the top of the egg should have a pinkish
tinge. Enjoy!
Scrambled egg
Probably the quickest of the lot, all you
need here is a decent non-stick (ish) pan,
a couple of good eggs, some butter and
some salt and pepper.
Melt a blob of butter into a hot pan.
Whisk 2-3 eggs in a bowl and add a de-
cent sprinkle of salt and pepper.
Pour the egg into pan. The pan should
be hot enough so that the egg cooks
straight away so make sure you scram-
ble it! The cooking process should take
less than two minutes.
Alpine egg
You might not have heard of these beau-
ties but a good alpine egg can be amaz-
ing. What you need here is an egg, some
butter, some grated cheese and a rame-
kin. If you don’t have this, just a normal
coffee cup will do.
Butter the ramekin or cup and put half
the cheese on the bottom.
Crack the egg on top the cheese then
carefully sprinkle the rest of the cheese
so the egg is totally covered. Add a fair
amount of salt and pepper.
You can add chives, spring onion or
finely chopped onion for extra flavour.
Have your oven on gas 5 or 190°C and
whack in the ramekin for about 10 min-
utes max. If you’re using the coffee cup
put it in the microwave instead for about
2-3 minutes.
I suggest using the cup in the micro-
wave method purely for speed.
Out of all the recipes I strongly rec-
ommend this one. This is my personal
favourite, its quick, easy and if you add
a bit of salad (yeah, right) or have it with
some bread it can be a decent meal.
So there you have it. Four ways to use
those eggs in your flatmate’s fridge.
Enjoy.
