PhD funding
blunder in Aero
Department failed to tell students
their bursary was being reduced
Eleven PhD students in the Department
of Aeronautics have been left angered
and confused after their monthly bur-
sary payments were cut in December
and January. No forewarning was given
to the students; a blunder described as
“unfortunate” by the Head of Depart-
ment.
Nine of the affected students are sup-
ported by funding from the Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research Council
(EPSRC) which sets a national mini-
mum stipend designed to cover their
living costs. This amount for 2010-11
is £13,590 and increases in line with
inflation each year; using the Treasury’s
GDP deflator, a measure of general in-
flation. However, the EPSRC does not
make payments directly to students. It
gives a block grant to Imperial, approxi-
mately £6m, which is then distributed to
departments who decide how much each
student receives.
It is therefore the department that pays
the students an amount which, in pre-
vious years in the Aeronautics Depart-
ment, has coincided with the EPSRC
minimum stipend plus an additional
‘London Living Allowance’ of £2000
to cover the costs of living in the city.
However, when the students checked
their bank accounts in December, they
noticed they had been paid a reduced
bursary that month, which adds up to a
total cut of £223 for the year.
The Head of Department and Profes-
sor of Aerostructures, Professor Ferri M.
H. Aliabadi said that the bursaries are set
not according to the EPSRC’s rates, but
by the College minimum rate for PhD
students. He explained that, “by mis-
take, in October and November 2010,
the payments were made at a higher rate
than the College minimum recommen-
dation. In December a correction was
made to the EPSRC bursary payments,
reducing them by an average of £18.50
per month, to re-align the student bursa-
ries with the College minimum.”
The College minimum rate is deter-
mined by the College’s Management
Board and is not directly linked to rates
offered by research councils. The dis-
crepancy of £223 for 2010/11 is because
the College’s minimum rate increased
by 0.5% while the EPSRC’s minimum
increased by 2.5%.
Malcolm Aldridge, the Head of the
Bursaries Payment Office, explained
that the staff pay throughout the Col-
lege had also increased by 0.5% and that
when the decision was made, there were
significant pressures on higher education
institutions to restrain pay increases.
