19.02
‘19.02’ is Felix’s first ever music
night, held in Metric on Satur-
day the 19th of February. It will
showcase talent from across the
spectrum of Imperial’s music
community including acts from
MusicTech and Jazz n’ Rock. En-
try is a trifling £3 – affordable for
even the most cost-conscious stu-
dents out there. Check out the in-
terview with headliners The Vetoes
on page 25 for more information.
It’s going to be the biggest night of
the year, well we would say that...
Almost all of the stories that you
read in the paper are also avail-
able online from 7am every Friday
morning. You can share stories
with your friends and, most impor-
tantly, comment – anonymously, if
you must – on articles that have
particularly riled or appeased you.
Type facebook.com/FelixImperial
into your browser and you will
stumble upon the delightful world
of whatever links the Felix Editor
has decided to post that day.
These include links to interesting
articles from that week, the songs
that we’re listening to in the Felix
Office and other random junk
from the internet – varying from
articles about higher education to
videos of people falling over. It’s
a great way to keep up with Felix.
It’s time to lose your aversion to
Twitter, follow @feliximperial and
listen in to the banal thoughts
of the Felix Editor; which usually
centre around the ridiculousness
of getting 30 hours of sleep a
week and how nobody comes to
the Felix JCR stall on Monday,
speaking of which...
Monday’s JCR Stall
Every Monday, Felix holds a stall
in the JCR from 12-12:30. It’s
your chance to accost the Felix
Editor and politely (or rudely) tell
him what we’re getting wrong, or
right hopefully. Come say hi!
