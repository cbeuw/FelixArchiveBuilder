Ah man, I can’t wait till this is over so I can go to www.felixonline.co.uk/sex and fill out the survey
side-by-side trying to outsmart the other
as well as bringing in the complex le-
gal and political interplay involved.
The levels of complexity build as the
show matures, in my opinion reach-
ing its absolute peak in the dying epi-
sodes of series 3. Although it requires
watching the preceding 30+ hours as a
warm up, I would call the penultimate
episode of series 3 as The one hour of
television drama that everyone should
watch. HBO are slightly overly sex ob-
sessed when it comes to their produc-
tions (see: True Blood) but the gratui-
tous amounts of sex scenes in The Wire
are needed to help with the characters
interactions with each other. However
it is not as an ensemble piece that The
Wire excels, although it does so any-
way; rather it is through the creation of
stand out, completely three dimensional
characters who feel for all intents and
purposes people you actually know in
real life. Bubbles, McNulty and the ter-
rifying Omar are to name but three, but
the whole cast is a collection of perfect-
ly matched acting skill and razor sharp
scripting. The final series lost its way,
although the bittersweet final montage
went most of the way to redeem it for its
sins; and other than the slightly frustrat-
ingly slow pace at the beginning of the
first two series, I have nothing else to
fault this show on. Hell, even its theme
tune makes my hair stand on end. Along
with The Sopranos, The Wire cements
HBOs status as the King of incredible
adult drama. Matt Allinson

The most respected network in the US launches this week in the UK as Sky Atlantic.
To celebrate, over the next couple of issues we will take a look at some of HBO’s
greats. This week, Matt Allinson and Lucia Podhorska review their favourites

Barack Obama as his favour-

going to be cool. Stand up comedian
David O’Doherty made the joke that
he knows people who love The Wire
so much they can’t even describe it in
words. “So what do you think of The
Wire?” He asks, “blaaeerrrrrghhh!” the
afflicted Wire fan replies. Unfortunate-
ly I frequently fall into this category,
so writing a coherent review is proving
quite difficult for me. The story follows
a team of Baltimore police officers,
over the course of 5 years, who spe-
cialise in surveillance operations on or-
ganised criminal groups. As can be ex-
pected with an HBO series, the baddies
and goodies are very indistinct from
each other: you know their life stories
and their complex backgrounds and the
show itself doesn’t force a judgement
on anyone. So much time and effort is

spent on developing the rich palette
of motives, desires and flaws in the
main cast: be they police chiefs, offic-
ers on the street, drug dealers or cor-
rupt union officials; that the plots can
simply unfold infront of you without
any clunky explaining scenes. Act-
ing talent is so abundant in this show
that it makes most other programs, and
even many films, look weak and feeble
by comparison. Each individual series
stand proud as a brilliant self contained
achievement of script writing and vi-
sion, starting with a simple premise for

ased on the popular Southern
Vampire Mysteries series of
novels by author Charlaine Har-
ris, True Blood was first introduced to
viewers in 2008 by Alan Ball, creator
of Six Feet Under and Academy Award
winning writer of American Beauty,
writes Lucia Podhorska.
In a world where vampires have come
out of the coffin and are living openly
alongside humans, the main character
Sookie Stackhouse is a waitress at Mer-
lotte’s in the small town of Bon Temps,
Louisiana. Played by Anna Paquin
(Academy Award winning actress from
The Piano), Sookie is 25 years old and a
telepath – she can hear what other peo-
ple around her are thinking. This might
seem like a gift, but when you have a
boss – Sam – who is in love with you
and a brother – Jason – who won’t stop
thinking about sex, it’s more of a curse.
But all this changes when Merlotte’s
gets its first vampire customer in the
form of Bill Compton. Bill is tall, dark
and handsome and Sookie can’t hear his
thoughts. Naturally, the two are drawn
to each other and a romance blossoms.
However, all is not well as their small
town appears to have a serial killer on
the loose, targeting women who as-
sociate with vampires. Throw in some
shapeshifters, werewolves and gor-
geous vampire sheriff Eric Northman
and Sookie’s life will never be the same
again…
On the surface this may sound like just
another Twilight or Vampire Diaries,
but thankfully none of the characters
are in high school anymore. While there
is plenty of romantic drama, True Blood
would not be an HBO show without
blood, gore and sex galore. By making
vampires a part of society and lobbying
because it always keeps me guessing. I
love finding out what has happened in
the past to make the characters the way
they are and with some vampires over
2000 years old, you can count on some
interesting history. All of the characters
are engaging and the casting has been
wonderful throughout, notably Nelsan
Ellis as Lafayette, who takes the theory
of ‘if you’ve got it, flaunt it’ to a whole
other level. Evan Rachel Woods, prob-
ably best known for her movie Thirteen,
is also a joy to watch as the Queen and
I’m interested to see what happens with
her character in season 4.
I find the show, which has received
numerous awards including an Emmy
and Golden Globe, to be completely ad-
dictive, causing me to watch all three
seasons in three days and making me
order the books as well. I am now half
way through re-watching season one af-
ter only one week and am still hooked.
And if that’s not the best compliment, I
don’t know what is…

for equal rights, the books and show are
also able to cleverly use these creatures
as a metaphor for other demographics
that have been discriminated against.
But what is also wonderfully refresh-
ing, is that the vampires are all three-di-

placed in the good or evil category. As
a viewer, I think this is really important,
