O
ne of the stories that has
emerged over the trans-
fer window period is the
clash between certain
premier league manag-
ers. Houllier is such a manager, who
has received criticism due to his con-
duct over the signing of Darren Bent
and what is seen as an insulting bid for
Blackpool’s Charlie Adam.
Bruce was particularly insulted that
Houllier neglected to give him a phone
call, leaving Sunderland less than half
of the transfer window to replace Bent.
While the transfer is strange given the
league positions of the teams, perhaps
Bent simply wanted the pay rise Villa
offered him.
Holloway is taking negotiations into
the press, criticising the teams who have
offered what he perceives to be low
bids, such as Villa and Liverpool. How-
ever, Houllier claimed that he was being
targeted because Holloway’s criticism
seemed to exclude Liverpool manager
Kenny Dalglish. This, I think is a bit
unfair on Holloway, who perhaps didn’t
want to criticise a legendary player and
manager.
However, I feel that the other criticism
of Houllier, this time coming from Steve
Bruce over Darren Bent’s move from
Sunderland to Villa, was justified. Bent
is a great player and I’m sure he will
be sorely missed by Sunderland. These
events raise a deeper issue. Is the estab-
lishment hostile towards foreign manag-
ers? Is the fact that Houllier is French
a factor which means English managers
feel it is OK to criticise him excessively
in the media? I would argue no in this
case. This is a country which has the rare
situation of a foreign manager managing
the national team.
In Italy, for example, the top jobs are
generally given to Italian managers or
managers who have been in Italy for the
vast majority of their playing careers,
such as Inter’s Leonardo. In Italy’s top
four, Leonardo is the only non-Italian
manager, whereas in the current top four
of the Premiership, there are no English
managers and only one British man-
ager, with two Italians and a French-
man. Therefore it is clear that those
running the clubs even have a positive
bias to foreign managers. Furthermore,
it is clear that a manager like Wenger is
generally respected across the board, de-
spite being French.
It is clear that everyone is simply pro-
tecting their own interests, and that Houl-
lier is attempting to play mind games but
losing at them very badly, as he appears
to be simply clutching at straws to silence
criticism about the way he has operated
on the transfer market. Houllier allegedly
broke regulations by contacting a player
without permission from the club, shown
by the suspiciously short time between
Bent’s transfer request and his announced
move. If this is true, which it seems to be,
Houllier has used what he labelled ‘rac-
ism’ as a PR tool which is wholly unac-
ceptable from a person in any position,
let alone one in the public eye in one of
the world’s most followed sports.
If, in over six years at Liverpool, he
was unable to grasp transfer regulations
or build up a reputation which other
managers respect, then citing xenopho-
bia when he is criticised will only cover
up a deeper problem.
Are foreign managers
victimised in the Premier
League?

Don’t wave your finger Houllier, it’s unbecoming of an English gen... oh wait
