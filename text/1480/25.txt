Regina Spektor
Live In London
Sire Records
★★★★✩
This, the second single to be released
of the forthcoming album ‘Wounded
Rhymes’ unfortunately does not appear
to show a positive progression in direc-
tion for the Swedish singer. A largely
generic forgettable lower mediocre
track, and lacks all of the charm a deli-
cacy that made her first album ‘Youth
Novels’ such a pleasing listen. Instead
a rather drab melody, both vocally and
percussively, is implemented for the
verse which leads to a rather plodding
chorus. It’s a shame because one felt
she had the potential to get better with
successive albums, but this indicates is
that the reverse has happened. Chris-

I Follow Rivers
LL Recordings
★★★✩✩
A live recording of her Hammersmith
Apollo concert a year earlier, this al-
bum showcases Regina Spektor’s truly
unique voice. From Russian folk to
tongue-in-cheek country, she lets her
music speak for her. Her creativity
also jumps out of the music, the song
‘Silly Eye-Color Generalization’ sang
acapella and ad-lib. You could be for-
given whilst listening to this album for
actually forgetting there’s an audience
in the album – only their applause at
the end of songs punctuating the string
quartet and drummer who accompany
Regina. Whilst unconventional, Regina
Spektor has built up a dedicated fan-
base, and this album goes some way to
showing why, with fan favourites such
as Fidelity, Eet, and Samson inter-
spersed with her trademark quaintness.

I’ll Be In The Sky
Grand Hustle
★★✩✩✩
‘I’ll Be In The Sky’ is the fourth single
to be released from B.o.B’s album ‘The
Adventures Of Bobby Ray’ and seems
to attempt to fill the large hole left by
OutKast. The beat bounces along nice-
ly enough, with B.o.B attempting to
channel the spirit of Andre 3000, but
the song lacks a great chorus to tether
it and ends up falling flat. The real dis-
appointment is that this release comes
after the great mixtape track ‘Beast
Mode’, which has him displaying his
excellent rapping skills to full effect.
Disappointing.

I
t’s tough being a guitar band in
2011. Only three guitar-based
tunes were featured in the UK’s
top 100 best-selling songs of
2010. It gets even more depress-
ing when you realise that half of the top
40 songs featured were by David Guet-
ta, Black Eyed Peas or Rihanna.
I still believe there is hope yet for rock.
Even more so when I meet unsigned
bands who remain optimistic about the
future of independant rock. The Vetoes
are that sort of band. After moving from
Reading to London for their studies,
The Vetoes developed their unique take
on rock. Despite being pigeon-holed as
indie-rock early on by critics, a much
better description of their style can be
found on their SoundCloud page as the
intriguing “Post Indie Tech Punk”.
We spoke about the deploring state of
rock, bands they dig and what they’ll
bring on February 19th, when they head-
line Felix’s Music Night, 19.02.
What kind of music did you guys set
out to make?
Tobias (guitar, vocals): Initially we were
just two guitarists writing music, which
turned out as guitar rock. And gradually
we’ve been fighting against everything
Balls out rock at 19.02
Greg Power spoke to alt-rockers The Vetoes, headliners of the first
Felix Music Night who promise to bring the balls back to rock
that guitar rock means.
Andy (bass, vocals): Nowadays we’re
working at writing for other people to
listen to our music rather than just us.
You know, that’s Lead Guitarist Syn-
drome, you get obsessed with what
you’re doing. But we’ve been so con-
scious for the past year about writing for
other people, so we’re gradually shaping
our own sound now.
James (drums): I think as a band at the
moment what we’re aiming to do is just
make good music, but make it quite in-
teresting and a bit different, because I
just think everything out there is so bor-
ing right now.
Tobias: People look at us and tell us
“Wrong time to be a guitar band, huh?”.
What that’s turned into for most people
is some kind of super-duper styled guys,
grinding through chords and singing
songs about girls, and how much girls
hurt some times. And it’s just funda-
mentally uninspiring. But there’s always
been something about guitar music that
has excited people. Whether it was Nir-
vana in 1994, or Radiohead in 1997...
Andy: It’s just something that people are
always going to be able to relate to. The
guitar’s a very human instrument. But
there’s such a breadth of sounds you can
make with a guitar. There’s never really
going to be a limit to what you can do
as a guitar band. There’s always new
sounds you can create.
James: I think I’m kind of fed up with
rock at the moment because it’s just so
not rock. When you’re a rock drummer,
you get on stage and you get topless and
you smash the drums as hard as you can.
So many bands now are boring. They’re
Vetoes: making rock kinky again
not even doing anything musically inter-
esting, and they look bored on stage.
What are some of your influences?
Tobias: It’s weird how our influences
work, because I can tell you some of
my favourite bands, Andy’ll tell you his,
James’ll tell you his and they’ll be so dif-
ferent but we can have points at which the
reasons why we like them are the same.
One band that me and Andy really like
is Radiohead, because every song is
unique and exiciting in its own way. But
then I like kind of hardcore punk stuff,
from the schizoid stuff of Blood Broth-
ers, to the nuts-out weird vocals of Fu-
ture of the Left. And the balls that you
get from that kind of rock. Mixed in with
some of the intricacies, and the openness,
and the textures of some of the indie
bands. Wild Beasts have a really great
open kind of feel to them… but with the
balls. I think the balls are what people are
missing. Just the cojones man. Cojones!
Andy: I guess we try and bring the fun
element of bands that are gonna make
you move, like Foals. On the punk
scene you have Johnny Foreigner,
they’re just so much fun. We’re trying
to combine that fun with really intricate
guitar arrangements.
Tobias: We’ve shifted our focus from
“I like playing that. I’ll play my good
part.” to saying just “How does this
make me feel?”. And that’s what mu-
sic’s about. Making people feel some-
thing. Whether it’s about making people
feel scared, happy and elated or making
them just want to boogie their arse off.
That’s what we want to do. It’s liberat-
ing in a way because you’re not worried
particularly about what you’re playing,
you’re just in the moment, enjoying it.
I think we’re working out if you can’t
make something good with four chords,
and one time signature and rhythmic
feel, then you’re not going to make
something good that has a million of
them. We’ve learnt to restrain ourselves,
and just try to make good music that’s
there for itself and for people to listen to.
What will you guys bring to 19.02?
Tobias: We can bring a shitload of ener-
gy. We’ll just be nuts, and make people
want to jump up and down.
Andy: We are the kind of people that you
could take home to meet your grand-
mother. But when we get up on stage,
we kind of change. So, you know, I’m
looking forward to it.
James: Sex, drugs, rock n’ roll!
Tobias: Except without the sex and the
drugs...
The Vetoes are having a launch party
for their new EP Ritalin / Ritalout on
February 7th at The Social (£5).
