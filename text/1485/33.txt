Scorpio
This week, you’re terribly upset about
the quality of the candidates running
in the ICU Sabb elections. Not a single
one has got naked, covered themselves
in whipped cream OR showed up on my
door ready and willing to go down on
me... I mean, goddamn!
THE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS Horoscopes
Aries
This week, you do a proper clean on
your carpet. I mean, a shit hot proper job.
You detergent the hell out of that bitch.
You scrub it like it doesn’t know who its
daddy was. You use stain removal like
he’s bouncing on 22s on the West Coast.
You... You... take this joke too far.
Taurus
This week, you’re getting all nuanced
and shit outside McDonalds when...
What does “getting all nuanced” mean?
Phssst, if you don’t know THAT then
I’ve got no time for you. It’s a swag East
London term that you obviously aren’t
cool enough to have heard of.
Gemini
This week, you’re very aware of the
space underneath your bed. As you’re ly-
ing at night in the darkness, dark thoughts
swirl in your mind about what could be
hiding there. You hear a noise and pick
up the courage to take a peek. It’s Charlie
Sheen making out with P. Diddy...
Cancer
This week, Barclays block your account
due to a security breach. When you fi-
nally resolve the matter you find out that
fraudsters cunningly placed a live parrot
on your shoulder. The parrot has recorded
all your information for the last 4 months.
WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME!?!?!
Leo
This week, you’re really looking forward
to the end of term. Especially because of
the Royal Wedding. You get over-excited
and cover your entire house in Union
Jack bunting. Your housemates are an-
noyed but philosophical: “Hey, at least
you didn’t shit on my pillow.” You did...
Virgo
This week, you pick up your toaster and
your radio (who the fuck owns a radio?)
and head over to the bathtub to commit
suicide. You jump in. Nothing happens.
You forgot to plug them in, douchebag.
The Burger King Man finishes you off
with Charlie Sheen’s shrivelled balls.
Libra
This week, you’re outside the JCR
looking at people suspiciously.
<__<
>__>
<__<
You silently fart. The wind blows it
away. You win, again.
Sagittarius
This week, you’re hooked on the Union’s
live voting stats page when you notice
something disturbing. You literally have
no life. You go on Facebook, no-one’s
on chat. They must be ‘outside’ or some-
thing. You cry, and click refresh. Oh a no-
tification! It’s a spam invite... Oh.
Capricorn
This week, it’s the morning, which isn’t
particularly interesting or exciting. Ex-
cept THIS morning there’s a gorilla on
your bed. It’s wearing skinny jeans and
it wants you to go party in Brixton with
it. Before you can respond it jets off into
outer-space. Damn happy pills...
Aquarius
This week, you’re smoking some crack
on the Queen’s Lawn, when the Queen
comes over and starts bitching about
“it’s my lawn” yadda yadda. You stand
up, jab her in the eye and then deliver
your killer line “Monarchy this” before
kicking her in the face.
Pisces
This week, you’re queuing outside a
club when some girl pushes in front of
you. You pull out a knife and stab your-
self. As you lie on the pavement, bleed-
ing to death, you cry out, “FUCK YOU
BITCH!” At your funeral, the consensus
is that it was a bad move...
Road sign takes Libyan
rebel by surprise
DRUNKEN MATE
OF THE WEEK
Yeh! Who needs Transport for London anyway? Take that Bob Crow! Fuck the bus! This guy is rolling easy...
