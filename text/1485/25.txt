opportunity for change at the House of
Dior, and evolution of a brand is un-
avoidable and ought to be celebrated.
Galliano will still be sorely missed
as one of the fashion industry’s real
heavy-hitters. With few other design-
ers considered his equal in terms of
talent and influence, (Karl Lagerfeld,
Jean Paul Gaultier and Giorgio Armani
arguably make up the rest of fashion’s
‘old guard’) his absence will be felt
acutely; many have been sympathetic
to his demise. Says Suzy Menkes of
the International Herald Tribune: “The
pressure from fast fashion and from
the instant Internet age to create
new things constantly has worn
down other famous names. Marc
Jacobs, design director of Louis
Vuitton, ended a wild streak in
rehab. Calvin Klein famously
rambled across a sports
pitch and admitted to sub-
stance abuse. And the late
Yves Saint Laurent spent
a lifetime fighting his de-
mons.” Hilary Alexander
of the Daily Telegraph
was shocked at his be-
haviour but added, “I am
not for a moment excus-
ing his behaviour. There
will come a time when he
must confront the viper in
his breast. But right now,
this is a moment in his life
when he needs support and
love from the industry he
has given his life to.”
His swansong, how-
ever, was disappointing.
With only a few com-
prehensive looks that
really paid tribute to
Galliano’s talent and
mastery at Dior, his
final collection left
something to be de-
sired. Tim Blanks
at style.com com-
mented that perhaps a ready-to-wear
collection was not a proper farewell
for Galliano, “it was a pale testament
to the extraordinary work the ateliers
have done for Galliano over the past
14 years. The proper tribute would ide-
ally have been one of the Dior couture
shows, where the extravagant drama of
the designer’s soaring imagination was
evenly matched by breathtaking work-
manship.”
There is no doubt that John Galliano’s
behaviour was unacceptable and that
he is in need of help and rehabilitation
for his problems with alcohol. Previ-
ous disgraces in the fashion industry,
especially amongst its most brightly
shining stars, have not been uncom-
mon. Pictures released in 2005 of Kate
Moss snorting cocaine led to her being
dropped from numerous advertising
campaigns; Galliano is now employing
Gerald Tyrrell, the lawyer whose help
Moss enlisted at the time. Tim Blanks
remarked, “The only precedent for this
situation is Coco Chanel’s post-war
denunciation as a Nazi collaboratrice.
Her exile from the fashion world lasted
nine years.”
A
fter allegations of anti-
semitic and racial slurs
against a couple in a
Parisian café, and the re-
lease of a damning video
evidencing yet more abusive behaviour,
John Galliano was dismissed from his
role as designer for Christian Dior last
Thursday. Although the fashion world
has been rocked by the shocking events
leading to his dismissal, fashion month,
now at its tail-end, continued unhin-
dered, and Galliano’s final show at Dior
went ahead on Sunday. Dior CEO Sid-
ney Toledano prefaced the show with a
speech about the values that Christian
Dior has represented, asserting that
they would be preserved by “the heart
of the House of Dior, which beats un-
seen… made up of its teams and studios,
of its seamstresses and craftsmen”. It is
rumoured that these petites mains bore
most of the brunt of this final collection
whilst John Galliano was battling his
problems with alcoholism.
Following Galliano’s ignominious
fall, rumours have become rife as to
who will be his successor. Amongst the
contenders are: Stefano Pilati, designer
at Yves Saint Laurent; Alber Elbaz, the
celebrated designer behind Lanvin; Ol-
ivier Theyksens, who has previously
designed for Rochas and Nina Ricci;
and Haider Ackermann, whose most
recent own-label collections have been
received to much critical acclaim. The
frontrunner, however, appears to be
Riccardo Tisci, designer at Givenchy
– the label which John Galliano spent
two years designing for before moving
to Christian Dior. Tisci will be familiar
with the large number of collections ex-
pected at the great and historic design
house, which turns 64 this year. Chris-
tian Dior sends out two ready-to-wear
collections as well as two couture col-
lections; most design houses no longer
create the expensive couture collections
that arguably maintain the essence of
the particular design house’s aesthetic.
However, amongst the most traditional
brands that still produce couture, which
include Valentino and Chanel, Givenchy
remains one of them, which places Tisci
at huge advantage.
Some commentators seem concerned
by this potential choice, however:
WWD claims that Tisci’s aesthetic is
“perhaps too dark and brooding for the
global behemoth that is Dior.” His previ-
ous collections for Givenchy (far right)
have drawn comments about his gothic
fascinations, he himself cited Frida
Kahlo as an inspiration for his Fall 2010
couture collection which contained re-
Tisci to replace disgraced Galliano?
As rumours of Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci as successor to the Dior throne
grow, the industry reminisces about Galliano’s legacy: Saskia Verhagen reports
John Galliano at the end of his final couture collection (below) for Dior
ligious, anatomical
and deathly imagery.
Dior, on the other
hand, will require
some modulation of
the designer’s incli-
nations towards the
dark and brooding
aesthetic that he
has developed
at Givenchy;
Dior is a house
famed for
traditional el-
egance and sub-
lime femininity.
Despite this, there are
few doubts about Tisci’s
level of craftsman-
ship. Famed for his
notoriously painstak-
ing attention to detail,
the “ultimate in arti-
sanship and feminin-
ity”, which Toledo
paid tribute to in his
speech, will certain-
ly be maintained.
Whomever they choose,
however, this is an exciting
“With few other
designers considered
his equal, his absence
will be felt acutely;
many have been
sympathetic to his
demise”
