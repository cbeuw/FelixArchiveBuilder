Imperial’s Wakeboarding society com-
peted at local waterhole Liquid Lei-
sure on March 2nd against eight uni-
versities. With 100 students hitting
the water in less than comfortable
temperatures – the competition took
real dedication to the sport. Imperial
brought eight people to compete in-
cluding two girls (good ratio).
In the Beginners Men’s category,
social secretary Gary Willis showed
he was more than just a pretty boy
in retro 80s jackets. Pulling some
sick moves on the kickers and a few
tasty boardslides, he came 1st in the
category. In the Beginners Women’s
we had two riders – Danielle ‘the
nutter’ Barnes and myself. Danielle
safely landed the funbox, but sadly
the allocated time for this round of
the competition had closed and it
didn’t count towards the judging. No
placers here but still some promis-
ing improvements – watch this space!
Intermediate Men’s saw Tim ‘Timmy’
Thio placed very respectably in sec-
ond. Antoine Desmet, our only com-
petitor in the Advanced category, was
up against some stiff competition.
Although his flat water tricks are the
real deal, his 180°s off the kickers
didn’t cut the mustard, shame.
As the sun was setting, the Wakes-
kate category started. Picture being
towed by the cable on a large skate-
board around a lake. This is not some-
thing the team have been familiar
with. Still, no strangers to try the new
and wacky Jan Jachnik, Gary and Tim
gave it a go. Jeered on by the rest of
the team – these guys just went for it!
They may not have been spectacular
but they were the most entertaining
ones out there! So finally, Timmy also
won a bonus award for Most Entertain-
ing Photo of the Day – don’t try this
one at home, kids. Join Wakeboarding
instead!
