Imperial students victorious
in enterprise competition
Maximo Sanz Hernandez and Alexandru Podgurschi, from Imperial’s
Entrepreneurs Society, report on winning this year’s London Apprentice Challenge
O
n Monday February
21st, three teams repre-
senting Imperial College
London, King’s College
London and UCL com-
peted in the London Apprentice 2011
in the first year of the event. Proudly
organized by Imperial Entrepreneurs,
the KCL Business Club and the UCL
Entrepreneurs Society, the competi-
tion was a major success, attracting
high-profile judges such as Margaret
Mountford (from ‘The Apprentice’),
Pier Paolo Mucelli (founder and CEO
of eOffice) and a representative from
Oliver Wyman.
The competition consisted of three
challenges which took place over the
weekend and were presented before the
public the following Monday at King’s
College London. The first task was de-
signing the ideal office for the future
and radical high-tech ideas were in no
shortage.
The projects presented by the teams
varied widely. UCL proposed an office
with a highly specific conference room
which was designed to stimulate the five
senses and included touchscreen walls
amongst other technical innovations.
The King’s College team suggested a
more traditional approach with a clear
distinction between the administrative
staff and the creative department. Our
representatives focused on flexibility
and utilitarianism, introducing the idea
of an ever-changing office layout fea-
turing remote controls attached to indi-
vidual desks. The audience was sure to
be impressed by the amalgamation of
fresh ideas, but Mr. Mucelli was quick
at pointing out flaws in their plans. Just
like in the BBC Apprentice.
The second task tested the teams’
communication and bargaining skills.
The mission: go around London with a
paper clip and exchange it for something
more valuable, a step repeated as many
times as possible in order to obtain the
greatest profit.
Time was just one of the many con-
straints added to the task, as was the rule
that prohibited donations. Every item or
amount of money had to be traded for
something else. Team work and having a
clear strategic approach to the task were
crucial in this challenge. Teams’ strate-
gies ranged from visiting individual
homes to travelling to touristic areas,
where they could easily “rip off” people.
Imperial chose the former and knocked
on the doors of South Kensington hous-
es and in the end managed to eke out
over £100 (from a paper clip!), after
several remarkable feats such as trading
a pen for £10.
The third challenge tested the teams’
market analysis aptitudes and their abil-
ity to come up with a feasible long term
business plan. The teams had to design
a new range of Tesco products or ser-
vices. The UCL team developed a social
branch of the company, featuring prod-
ucts that would give away a percentage
of the revenue to charity. Even though
this project had no start-up cost, it also
produced zero income, an aspect that
was immediately noted by Margaret.
The King’s team put forward a net-
work of Tesco affiliated gyms, whose
major selling point was the price of the
membership. However, the team under-
estimated the costs of running a nation-
al-scale gym service. Lastly, Imperial
presented ‘Tesco Learn’, an educational
platform that provided basic literacy
and numeracy training. Although it was
a noble idea, the judges were not com-
pletely sold on it.
After the presentation of these three
tasks, the judges took some time to
discuss the performance of each team
and announced the winner of each chal-
lenge, followed by the presentation of
the overall winner. As you would all ex-
pect, Imperial dominated the competi-
tion winning two out of three tasks, and
won the title of London Apprentice of
2011. Zhen Lim was also awarded ‘Best
Performer’ for the entire competition.
Massive congratulations to the winning
team. Nitin Nihalani, Sohasini Sudthar-
alingam, Mohammed Shaath and Lim
Zhen Xiong brought the title to Imperial
and made their first of many appearanc-
es on the business scene.

tv’s profile on YouTube, whose cover-
age of the event was greatly appreciated
and central to making the event a major
success.
Make sure to drop by the Business
School on Tuesday 15th for the ‘Ideas
Empowered’ competition, Imperial En-
trepreneurs’ next big event where teams
will have to pitch their business ideas
and try to convince the judges that their
plan is worthy of the £5000 prize.
