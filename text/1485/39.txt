Varsity – College
spirit at its best
Well what else did you guys expect
to see next week.
Yes it’s that time of year again
when the College does battle with
“some of Britain’s best young brains
in the process of getting smashed
out of their heads”, to quote the
Daily Fail. What a bunch of pricks
– Daily Mail guys, not the Medics.
What the hell did they expect to see
when they went to a students’ union,
everyone having a cup of prune juice
whilst reading the latest revelation
of why Britain is falling apart in their
so called paper? If the Daily Mail
did Universities, they’d be shit. By
the way, I know this happened ages
ago, but it was just brought up in the
office and it got me going! But I di-
gress.
I’m sure you all know by now that
next Wednesday is going to be the
biggest sporting day in Imperial’s
calendar. A day of witty banter, on
the most part, mega phones and
bottles of celebratory/commisera-
tive port, topped off with a game of
rugby which, let’s face it, has to be
better than last year’s performance.
The Stoop hasn’t got a clue what is
coming its way.
And to all of you who enquired
about the lovely Lindsay Hennah,
you can find her in Ethos on Wednes-
day.

Second Pit Stop
Sum up how your progress over
the season has gone so far?
It has been one of the better years
for the medics this year. So far we
stand 3W 2L and still have 2 more
games to play.
How do you prepare for a match?
Get the squad together, refs, peo-
ple to table and an email to men-
tally prepare the squad.
Favourite pre and post match
meal?
Pasta of any sort/beer after beer
(especially when we win=D)
What tune do you listen to get
psyched before a game?
In Flames - Episode 666
How have you built up good team
spirit amongst your players?
Reminding them to stay focused,
regular socials after practice and
winning games.
Medic Basketball
Hong Chen
Favourite sporting motto?
It’s not the size of the dog in the
fight but the size of the fight in the
dog.
Who’s your sporting idol?
Lance Armstrong
How important is Varsity to you?
Could it be described as being
season defining?
Varsity is definitely important es-
pecially this year we have a very
strong team and we hope we can
give the 1st team boys a run for
their money. Birmingham beat Ar-
senal in the Carling cup so noth-
ing is impossible. Having said
that our season has been one of
the best in years so we are very
proud of what we have achieved
so far.
Prediction for the result?
Close one. 61-60 Medics with a
buzzer beater 3-pointer.
Is there more pressure to achieve
a result at Varsity than any of
your other games?
No, we go in every game with the
same mentality to not cloud our
judgements.
Do you feel that the rugby match
overshadows the other sports?
I don’t think it overshadows but
it’s definitely a highlight of the day.
Thoughts on ‘grazing’ becoming
an international sport?
I have no idea what you are talking
about.
