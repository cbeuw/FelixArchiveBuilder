To all; Grammer? and,
spelling nerds
Are you a spelling and grammar Nazi?
You know what I mean. Do you judge
people when they use the incorrect spell-
ing and grammar? Most of you probably
are, as you are intelligent. It wouldn’t
make sense for someone who doesn’t
know anything about a subject to lecture
others on it. It would be like Colonel
Gadaffi lecturing us on sanity (BOOM
– TAKE THAT Colonel). I bet the sight
of “should of” when it actually should
say “should have” will cause you to go
into bouts of anger faster than Chris
Brown outside an award ceremony. I bet
you cream yourself silly when you see
an error while browsing the BBC news
website. Wow, you need to get laid. Or
at least start watching porn, I’m sure
there is some out there that starts with
a teacher showing a class of 6ft 2” guys
and bleach blonde women how to use
an apostrophe. One guy couldn’t get
the concept, so she kept him after class.
Crazy thing is, she didn’t even explain it
to him again. They just ended up having
sex in 10 different positions. Weird...
Some people are just very proud of
their grammatical abilities. The type of
person I am referring to is the type that
go out of their way to use a semi co-
lon, as they feel like a grammar bad-ass
when they use one.
When you think about it, it doesn’t
make any sense. Essentially, grammar
and spelling is just a bunch of made up
rules aren’t they. However, I, like you,
am a hypocrite. I don’t mind being a
hypocrite; we all are about something
(BOOM, I used a semi-colon *does the
grammar bad-ass dance...) If you say
that you are “not a hypocrite” then you
are a hypocrite about being hypocritical.
I bet this is the most times you’ve seen
the word hypocrite (there’s another one)
in a paragraph.
However, when a lecturer sends me a
poorly worded email, or an email with
English that doesn’t quite make sense,
it denigrates (yes I used a thesaurus to
find denigrate, and what?) any intellec-
tual point they are making. If a member
of staff does this: point out the mistake,
correcting it in your reply. This email
should be cc’d to the entire university
and should end with “get your grammar
game in check biatch.” Gotta keep it
hood... obviously.
It all depends on the scenario. If some-
thing is informal, it is acceptable to be
lazy about full stops, capital letters etc.
People already do this, and there are dis-
tinctive groups that they can be placed
into. I have done this for you, as that’s
just how I roll. The place to see this is,
where else, Facebook. So here are the
types of Facebook users:

Hangman for
Felix Editor,
who wouldn’t?
What do you
mean I wasn’t
listed? That’s
it, I’m going
all Gaddafi
on this one (it
can’t be ‘too
soon’ if it’s
still ongoing,
right?)
The… King… Of… Suspense…
Every single thing written by this person
ends, starts or includes an ellipsis. Liter-
ally… everything… is… so… suspense-
ful… see how annoying it is? If you do
it, stop it. I can’t bear the suspense.
What will the next part of the sentence
be? Will they eat ANOTHER doughnut?
They already ate three, one more would
be madness.
The grammar obsessive
This person will rarely update their sta-
tus, write on someone’s wall or com-
ment on pictures. This is because they
are not confident enough in their own
grammatical ability to actually commit
to clicking the share button. When they
finally do, they realize an errant comma
and so they delete it. If they do bring
themselves to keep it, they will use their
best friend, the star, to correct the error.
This is a completely normal thing to do.
*OCD thing to do.

Y do u tlk lyk this. We r not 10. N dis is
not msn msngr. U luk lyk a fcking twat.
Most of the words are only one letter
shorter. Why the fuck would that be in
any way easier or better. Is your time
that precious that the second you save
is really worth looking like a dickhead
for? It doesn’t make you look street
either; do you think gangstas update
their statuses with a smiley at the end?
Do you? No, gangstas send out group
emails.
The f**king censoring c**t
Example: “I can’t f-ing believe this
s**t”
Let me see if I can crack your code.
Is that supposed to say “I’m a gigantic
prickfeatures.” It wasn’t? Oh, well it
fucking should have.
There has to be a mention for the person
who puts “thinks” or “is” or some such
in every status. They really are clinging
on to the past, but nostalgia has never
hurt anyone. Except for that time I was
thinking about the past in the middle of
the road and got hit by a bus.
Special mention also has to go to the
name signer. As we couldn’t tell who it
was from the name, or the photo next to
said name, or the fact that we actively
added you because we know who you
are. So luckily their initials after the
wall post helped clear up the confusion.
There is a message to take away from
this; grammar is important but it’s not
the end of the world when someone
misses out a comma. Holy shit did you
just see that? I just used a semi colon
correctly! I am a grammatical badman.
