Student's suicide "bewildering"
MARIA IOANNOU A N D
MATTHEW K E M P T O N
College has been shaken by the death
of third year Biochemistry student,
Richard Parker, who committed sui-
cide on the last day of term before the
Christmas break. Parker, a biochem-
istry student on a year in industry,
died in circumstances that have been
described as "bewildering."
On Friday 20th December M r
Parker went to a business lunch in his
Department, which ended at around
5pm. Reports sugggest that he was
drinking during the dinner, but not to
excess. He then made his way to
Evelyn Gardens and entered
Southwell Hall of residence.
At around 6pm, Mr Parker set off
the fire alarms in houses 55 and 56.
He then evacuated students from the
building, claiming he was the Senior
Fire Officer for halls of residence.
Subwardens, also in the process of
evacuating the students, did not
recognise Parker and so, suspecting
that he was responsible for breaking
the alarm glasses, escorted him from
the building and placed him in chrage
of the security guard on duty.
However, the security guard, whom
residents claim was clearly drunk,
released him.
Mr Parker then reentered
Southwell Hall, this time with a sub-
warden from Bernard Sunley. Again
he claimed he was a fire officer and
insisted on flashing his College
swipecard to prove it. Students who
recognised him from the first time,
alerted a subwarden who escorted Mr
Parker to Southwell Hall's warden,
Dr Ken Young.

The Union is currently discussing
plans to restore some of the revenue
it will lose when Waterstone's
Booksellers takes over its trade in
academic texts. The Union's profile
amongst its members is also under
review.
Suggestions for new services to
replace the trade in academic texts
are varied. The Union will retain the
building currently known as
Bookstore, since Waterstone's will
have a new site in the library build-
ing, and most of the suggestions are
concerned with what to do with the
building when it ceases to sell acade-
mic texts. Piers Williams Deputy
President (Finance and Services)
says there will be no trade in books
of any kind, academic or otherwise,
since they could not compete with
Waterstone's in this field.
Ian Caldwell, Director of Estates,
has been assigned to deal with the
various "administrative" conse-
quences of the recent decision to
award the bookstore tender to
Waterstone's. Talking on the subject
of the Union's retail sites, he stated
that the College are "not opposed to
the Union trading", refuting recent
reports that the Rector had declared
that the Union should not be allowed
to trade in a commercial sense.
The most realistic suggestions are
those of expanding the store's exist-
ing trade in college regalia and sta-
tionery, and of transferring the trade
in newspapers and magazines from
the newsagent across the Walkway
to the store in order to allow the
newsagent greater space for confec-
tionery. More adventurous ideas
include a film-developing service, as
in some other universities, video
rental, as used to happen at IC, a
shop similar to Southside shop for
the sale of a limited range of gro-
ceries, and even a cafe bar.
Mr Caldwell added that the current
bookstore site could be redeveloped
as "some fairly sensible [trading]
activity" with the College's blessing.
On competition between the various
service providers on campus, he
commented "It's good to have two
people running these services... It
keeps each other on their toes."

Leaky library's power cut
The North Block o f ,
the Building is
CLOSED
N E W S T E A M
Rain water leaking through the
Library roof late on Wednesday
evening caused a localised power cut
in the main library and Sherfield
buildings, triggering an emergency
evacuation of College buildings.
All alarms on the College main
site sounded at around 10 o'clock on
Wednesday precipitating a general
evacuation. Speaking to Felix, Keith
Reynolds, Head of Security, ascribed
the power failure to "Water leaking
through the floors of the library and
shorting out the distribution box."
Peter Wray, Electrical Supervisor in
the Estates Division confirmed that
rain water had flooded the mains
riser in the library and "blown out"
the power intake.
Areas affected by the power cut
include the north side of the library,
the NatWest branch on level two of
Sherfield and all corridor lights and
fire alarms in the Sherfield building.
Mr Wray commented that, electrical-
ly speaking, "you couldn't pick out
anything worse to have happened."
He also said that there was a "lot of
damage" in the building.
Library staff expect that the north-
ern half of the library building will
not be fully open until Monday.
