Bewildering death
continued from front page
Dr Young questioned Mr Parker
but he refused to admit to smashing
the fire alarms. He did accept that he
wasn't a fire officer, however.
Questioning went on for about an
hour, until the warden decided that
no further progress would be made
that night. "It continually seemed
that he was cither going to walk out
or lash out" commented the warden,
who noted that Mr Parker seemed
drunk. Dr Young eventually sent him
home telling him the matter would be
kept 'in house' if he returned in the
morning to sort things out.
Richard Parker was escorted out of
the hall by the warden and walked to
his girlfriend's house in nearby Edith
Road. Also a student at Imperial
College, his girlfriend left Parker in
the flat soon after they arrived to
return to Southwell in order to
retrieve his jacket and glasses. Mr
Parker had been particularly upset
about leaving these items behind and
insisted that she fetch them. Whilst
there, she talked to the Warden, com-
menting that he was acting "way out
of character". She was clearly wor-
ried though not overly concerned and
after chatting with the Warden for
about half an hour, went back to her
flat.
On her return, she found Mr
Parker had hung himself whilst she
was out. He had left a rambling sui-
cide note in which his apology for
the havoc he had caused in Southwell
seemed to be his only major concern.
Dr Chapman, of the Biochemistry
Department, expressing his sadness
at the death of Richard Parker said
"...a fine student, it came completely
out of the blue." The company he
was working for this year have
informed College that they will not
only miss him as a person, but also
miss his professional contributions
"...he was doing an excellent job in
the lab." A l l third year biochemists
were informed of Richard Parker's
death and many of his friends have
had the opportunity to talk about
their loss with members of staff. Dr
Chapman talking about suicide in
general said "one is one too many."
It has been left to the jury at the
inquest, which takes place on the
13th February, to determine the rea-
sons for Richard Parker's actions,
though speculation is rife.

The Research Council science bud-
get for 1997/1998, released recently,
denotes a clear intention to support
the implementation of specific key
projects, as reported in Felix 1075.
This is particularly apparent for
research into BSE (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy, or
"mad cow disease") and related dis-
eases, which has received an ear-
marked £17 million from this year's
budget, bringing the total allocation
for work on this domain to £30 mil-
lion over three years.
The Imperial College School of
Medicine, one of the leading institu-
tions for investigation into these dis-
eases, will be especially affected by
this programme. As part of the pro-
ject of research on the implications
of the transmissibility of spongiform
encephalopathies, around £1 million
will be allocated to Imperial College
researcher John Collinge and his
team. Their mission will be to
explore the human prion diseases -
the diseases of the same family as the
BSE- and especially the Creutzfeld-
Jacob syndrome. Dr Rodney
Eastwood, from the Financial
Planning department, views this allo-
cation as an appreciable but logical
recognition of the "excellent, 1st-
class work" accomplished by
Professor Collinge, who is "making
good progress in this difficult and
delicate area".
As to the attributions to other
fields of research, Dr Eastwood
remarks that very little change has
been made with respect to the previ-
ous budget: "The money allocated to
the Research Councils is more or less
what there is at present, plus a few
small increases", especially for the
Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council (plus £5
million) and the Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council
(plus £8 million).
The distribution of these sums is
not expected to change much either,
with a significant majority of the
allocations (around 75% for the
Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council) going, as before,
to the most productive departments -
the same which obtained grades 5 or
5* at the RAE. If the Royal Society's
position was followed, research
funds should even be attributed more
selectively as in the past. However,
the Planning Office of Imperial
College expects very similar alloca-
tions for its departments as in the pre-
vious years.
This budget has been generally
welcomed positively by most
research councils, seeing it as a guar-
antee of stability and effectiveness in
British research. Yet some execu-
tives have expressed deep concerns
as to whether the funding, including
these allocations, will be sufficient to
support all the high-quality project
initiatives which will be presented in
the next few years to the Research
Councils.
Vaccine cure-all claims are
"misleading" says researcher
KENT YIP
A Sunday Times article published on
12"" January this year under the head-
line "Vaccine Could Cure A l l
Allergies At A Stroke" has been
described as "misleading" by Dr
Charlotte Hetzel, a co-worker in the
project headed by Professor Jonathan
Lamb.
Currently three million people in
this country are thought to be allergic
to house mites, tiny creatures found
in most domestic furniture. The vac-
cine concerned aims to immunise
people against allergic reactions to
house dust mites. It works by redi-
recting the immune pathway under-
taken by white cells on presentation
with the protein secreted by house
dust mites which triggers the allergic
response in the first place.
This may potentially be achieved
by introducing the white cells to an
altered version of the protein early on
in life. A strain of genetically engi-
neered, non-pathogenic species of
myobacteria can be used to deliver
the vaccine into the body.
The results obtained so far in
experimental models are promising.
The project is still at the laboratory
stage, and whilst its clinical potential
has been recognised, no vaccine for
clinical trial has yet been prepared. In
view of this, the suggestion in the
Sunday Times article that the three
million people who are allergic to
house dust mites will benefit imme-
diately from this work may seem
over optimistic.
