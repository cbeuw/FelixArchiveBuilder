12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 2 4 T H JANUARY
For better or worse, the level of
debate on Europe seems to be at an
all-time high. Much of this can be
attributed to the clowns in the
Referendum Party, but making this a
major campaign issue is highly bene-
ficial at such a important time in the
development of the EU. And from
where I am standing, if things aren't
sorted out tout de suite, we are in dire
trouble, dear reader.
Some say that Britain seeks only
narrow self-interest in Europe, com-
pared to France and Germany that
are in it for the common good. Where
Britain differs from our continental
partners is in the fact that our people
and our politicians are far more
closely aligned in their views on the
future of Europe. You may imagine
that the people of Germany are fanat-
ically Euro-enthusiastic. A recent
survey found that a majority of
Germans want a referendum on the
single currency. The Maastricht
Treaty only scraped through in
France and Denmark. Our portrayal
as being Eurosceptic is one that
everyone in the country should be
proud of, whether they agree with the
stance or not. For a country's leaders
to be so out of touch with public
opinion on constitutional matters is a
perilous situation.
Monetary union is, of course, the
hot potato at the moment. Money and
power have always been synony-
mous. Therefore, any move to cen-
tralise monetary policy is a shift in
power and thus sovereignty. Or so
you would think. This view is unique
to Britain. The French feel that mon-
etary, and ulti- Â»
mately political, J1 Ytl OII
union will
increase their sov-
ereignty by giving
them influence
over other coun-
tries, totally ignor-
ing the consequent
loss of control
over their own
affairs. The
Germans, howev-
er, are desperate to
cede sovereignty
in order that, once
and for all, they
cease to be seen
as a threat to
Europe. Less high-mindedly,
Germany, given her economic might
(albeit declining) in Europe, realises
that exercising control over her part-
ners economies allows her to protect
the competitiveness of German
industry by preventing all the old
dodgy ruses such as devaluation or

inflation brought about by slack
monetary policy. The early attempt
to do this, the apocalyptically awful
ERM, put such emphasis on killing
inflation in the 80s without reform-
ing economies, as we did, that it was
a major factor in the high unemploy-
ment on the continent.
Now the
E R M is to grow
into E M U (an
odd bird, invari-
ably seen with
Rod Hull's arm up
its nether regions,
that stands a cat in
hells chance of
ever getting off the
ground). Had
Lady Thatcher not
ousted Ted Heath,
this may have
already happened;
the original plan
was for mone-
tary union by
980, a point he
omitted to mention when we signed
up in 1973. Convergence is the name
of the game for EMU, namely if you
wish to have a single currency, it
would be prudent to ensure that all
the participating economies were in
economic sync on growth, inflation
and debt, for example. Oh dear. The
tricks, fiddles and fudges done to
achieve this have been incredible.
The French have nobbled pension
funds, the Dutch have sold gold like
nobody's business and the Italians
have sold everything that wasn't
nailed down. On the face of it not
even Germany should be allowed
into E M U , on account of national
debt. If these rules, less than perfect
in any case, are bent to the point of
cracking, the resulting currency will
be fatally flawed. We are best to steer
well clear of such a farrago.
Even if the rules were rigidly
obeyed and genuine efforts were
made to meet them, rather than the
shameless attempts to shoehorn
economies into E M U in 1999, the
benefits seem illusory. People talk of|
not having to change money in
Europe and the huge assistance to
business. What they forget are inter-
est rates. We shall end up with rates
too high in one place and too low
elsewhere, leading to problems in
both cases. It's difficult to get the
whole of Britain at the same point in
the economic cycle, let alone
Germany and Portugal. The E U
should stay as a single market. Move
towards a federal Europe, of which
this is the key step, and there will be
blood on the walls. Again.

Three Milk Bottles for the
Embassy to the Sultanate of O m a n
(supplied by PoetIC)
Every morning, coming out of the ground
Amidst the rush of nigh-colliding bodies,
To meet the trivial daily run
Of spectral insufficiencies,
At a brisklike pace, that looks so full ofpurpose,
My mind, though, will meander through the greyness,
As, walking past the embassies I notice
A Merc that's marked "ET" - quaint numberplates -
Or as I cross the road, so circumspect,
Three bottles of white milk, there on a sill
Of stone, next to a pillar made of stone -
The lifelessness intrigues me. What's therein,
Concealed within the dull, beige, mortared bricks?
Whose is this solitary sign of life:
Three bottles of white milk? - Strange reverie...
Beyond the embassy, the sultanate,
I trudge on like the rest, into the wheel.
