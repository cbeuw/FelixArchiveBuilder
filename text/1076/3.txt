Lilley lulls the masses
ANDREW SMITH
Peter Lilley MP, the Secretary of
State for Social Security, visited a
meeting of the Imperial College
Conservative Society last Wed-
nesday.
In an uninspired speach, he denied
that his party's divisions are any
worse than those of the Labour Party.
He also insisted that he had failed to
notice the Tory infighting exposed
by Teresa Gorman's recent attempt
to force a referendum on the
European Union. Ms Gorman, the
maverick M P for Billaricay, tabled
the motion to hold a nationwide vote
under the Ten Minute Rule. He also
spoke of his plans to trim the expen-
diture of the Department for Social
Security, (which accounts for a third
of all government expenditure), and
now supports twice the number of
people as it did in 1979, when the
Conservative Party first came to
power.
With a third of this budget being
spent on pensions, control of this sec-
tor is crucial to overall stability, and
Mr Lilley emphasised his "success"
in persuading two-thirds of those eli-
gible for state pensions to "opt-out"
and use private sector companies. He
added that the U K is in the best posi-
tion of any European country to deal
with the world-wide problem of age-
ing populations, pointing out that
"We've invested £600 billion to pay
for pensions, which is more than the
rest of Europe put together."
Mr Lilley, Member of Parliament
for St Albans, defended his attempts
to cut the money spent on housing
support for young people, single par-
ents and asylum seekers, insisting
that the measures did have a signifi-
cant effect on his overall spending.
It appeared that the Secretary of
State's proudest achievement is in
cutting benefit fraud, claiming that
since his appointment in 1992 his
department has saved £1.5bn, with
another £3bn to come. Mr Lilley
emphasised that none of his prede-
cessors had established a way of
analysing the level of fraud, but that
"We invented a system to measure
it."
He expressed the opinion that it
had been, and would continue to be
successful at measuring fraud, allow-
ing it to be better combated. The
telephone hotline
for benefit cheats,
"Squeal on a rat",
was cited as a par-
ticular example of
succesful anti-fraud
campaigning.
Turning to the
current political sit-
uation, the diminu-
tive Minister admit-
ted that his party
had "done our best
St Albans MP Peter Lilley in jubu-
lent mood. He refused to deny that
he would be a Conservative Party
leadership candidate after the
General Election,
to shoot ourselves in the foot from
time to time." Ignoring suggestions
that the recent Private Member's
Motion on the E U had once again
emphasised divisions, M r Lilley
expressed his hope that "that is all
behind us", and pointed to a group of
"50 Labour MPs led by Denzil
Davies" with similarly Eurosceptic
views.
With the Labour Party pledging to
keep to Conservative spending plans,
if elected at the next General
Election, the Minister denounced
Gordon Brown's promises as "not
credible". Mr Lilley admitted that his
preferred General Election date is 1
May, but the possibility of a Labour
victory does not appear to overly
worry the M P with a majority of
16,404. Speaking exclusively to
Felix after the meeting Mr Lilley
refused to deny that he would be a
candidate for the Conservative Party
leadership in the event of John
Major's resignation.
