Poetic muse but IC still lose
The football seconds' early season
optimism for a quick return to the top
flight has been slowly ebbing away
since late November when a slump
in form and fortune replaced the zeal
and steel, three meals and John Peel.
Keen to stop the rot hot-shot, shut-
up shop and have a pot at goal, IC
arrived in Enfield. Poor directions
and no landmark erections meant we
were fifteen minutes late, started
with eight but didn't hesitate to show
we're actually great!
After a couple more mins
We had a full team,
Lean mean with teeth that gleam.
Young Dave returnedfrom the
grave,
A tireless work-slave,
Played like he 'd been at a rave.
Hardcore Hajo: Midfield mover,
Had hands like a hoover.
He went in goal andfilledthe hole
Left by keeper Ste
Nursing his bad knee
He made a sure start with cat-like
instincts that prompted the RFH skip
to quip, "Shoot from anywhere,
chums!" Not that they had much
chances - they were pants and first
half we towered, RFH cowered, we
showered their penalty area with
crossed, shots, thumps, thwacks and
kzumps. Nothing like this had been
seen since the Luftwaffe carpet-
bombed the Eastend. It even
prompted fleet-footed Felix to offer
an apology for "(his) country's
behaviour in the war" as he gleefully
swerved past another set of nail-like
studs.
Nil-nil at half time hadn't done us
justice. Perhaps scoring five in the
second half would. It didn't happen.
That ageless comic who writes the
scripts of football matches served up
another howler.
BANG! BANG! BANG!
We found ourselves three down
and quite liderally chasing the game.
It was a bridge too far and despite a
poacher's goal be Martin after good
penetration by Jamie it was too late.
Darkness fell upon the land and we
trudged wearily home.
Pigs roasted by C & G
In C&G's maiden match of '97 the
boys proved that their Christmas hol-
iday fitness programme had truly
paid off. Our most brilliant play
came in the first half when Forest
Gate Police station's "substantial"
pack were overwhelmed by a fitter
and keener side. The black and red
of C&G dominated the breakdowns
and our backs who'd had their share
of Weetabix converted possession to
points. Dave Gul's inspired inter-
ception added a glowing five points
to his two earlier penalty conver-
sions.
Jim Sopper added insult to injury
when he proved by way of a weaving
deceptive run down the sideline that
the police "fitness exam" was no
more than a farce. Our backs contin-
ued to dominate play as Chris
Mutter, strapping lad that he is, drew
three men to hand Jim another try.
The half time whistle came with the
police wishing they'd stayed under-
cover.
The second half was disappointing
for C & G who struggled in the for
wards against the sheer obesity of
the oppo's pack which was now
being projected downhill. Despite
three lard-over scrum tries by the
"Couchon" we offered up one of the
best combination tries of this year as
our pack drove left and right for
Chris to deliver a delightful run
around try under the posts. Stick 'em
on a spit and roast them on open fire.
Overall a resounding success.

Uncensored full bore action at Bisley
with the IC shooters
The first trip of the year to Bisley,
the home of full-bore rifle shooting
was held on Saturday the 19th of
January. Twelve intrepid shooters set
off for what was for most of them
their first taste of outdoor rifle and
long range pistol shooting.
The morning consisted of shoot-
ing target rifle at 100 yards and prac-
tice one of the long range pistol
course of fire. This is two sighting
shots followed by two series of five
shots in thirty seconds. This is done
with a large calibre pistol such as a
44 magnum loaded to the limits of
safety to get the bullet there as fast as
possible. Despite this some reason-
able groups were attained which
bodes well for our attempt to defeat
Oxford and reclaim the Howe Cup
before the government prevents us
from holding the competition again.
Lunch was at the local chip shop
and the afternoon's shooting was
rifle at 200 yards and some clay
pigeon shooting. This gave people
the opportunity to try out an 1894
Winchester underlever rifle (John
Wayne fantasist) and Lawrence
could at last use his shotgun, pur-
chased ten years ago from Purdey for
Â£8000 but never fired before. A good
time was had by all.
The next full-bore rifle trip will be
(hopefully) at 300 and 500 yards for
the Courtman Shield, and inter-CCU
competition and a day out to a clay-
shooting ground for some much-
needed tuition. Both of these are
planned for February, so keep your
eye on the notice board. Enquiries
for membership may be made to the
range (in the sports centre) on
Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Glorious defeat for IC Virgins
Despite a slow first 10 minutes, the
weeks of line-out practice paid off
for the Virgins, when Ellen caught
an excellent throw in with the superb
lifting help from Mo and Lucy.
There followed a series of quick
penalties by Sarah C , Becky and
Ellen leading to an "International
style" try from Becky. Some experi-
mentation with varying the number
of forwards in the line-out proved to
confuse the not-so-cunning Vets.
Some exceptional passing by the
backs ensured that the Vets worked
hard for their points. And despite a
dis appointing score of Virgins 5 -
Royal Vets 44, it as agreed that it
was the Virgins finest display of
skills and fitness yet. Everyone
showed great improvement, and
team confidence has been boosted
greatly before our next match.
Back of the match goes to Clare
for her vicious tackles. Forward(s) of
the Match goes to Sue and Mo
because they both had great attitude,
tonnes of stamina and speed, and
corking aggression. Player of the
Match undoubtably goes to Becky
for her well "sexy" try!!! Loads of
sympathy to Shuggy who only got to
enjoy 20 minutes of the game before
being damaged making a storming
tackle.
Christmas comes late for
Cross-Country's Benny Boy
A fantastic performance from
Benny-Boy secured another victory
for IC's mens' team. Jennie, with
her graceful flowing strides, won the
womens' race as usual, with Bethan,
Dawn, Ruth and Christina coming
fourth, fifth, eleventh and fifteenth
respectively. Gaffer improved on his
positions with eighth place and Fishy
Fishick finished a lethargic thir-
teenth. Gut-retching hill sessions
and agonising circuits through the
autumn proved their worth with
excellent results especially from the
B team.
A special mention should go to
Yellow-Arse whose poor excuse for
not turning up was he was writing a
love-letter to his ex-girlfriend. He's
got more chance of winning the next
league race than getting her back.
[Good luck Mr Arse - Sports Eds]
