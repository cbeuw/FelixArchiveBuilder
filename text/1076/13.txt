FELIX FRIDAY 2 4 T H JANUARY Columns 1

Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
The Daily Mail was on excellent
form last Friday, carrying a front
page story decrying Jack Straw as the
"Man of Straw" for 'backing down'
to his own party's demands for
tougher opposition to the Police Bill,
recently ravaged in the Lords. The
Bill would have given statutory legal
powers to senior police officers to
bug and burgle premises in search for
evidence when investigating serious
crime. This managed to unite the
entire judiciary, most of the Lords
and the entire media against him.
Civil rights groups threw fits. The
only support Michael Howard had
was that of the Labour Home Affairs
spokesman, Jack Straw, who in des-
perately trying to outmanoeuvre
Howard on all crime-related affairs
found himself having to support even
the most moronic of crime bills -
there have been more Criminal and
Police Bills in the last seven years
than in the last sixty.
It is heartening to see that the
Opposition can occasionally do its
job properly, and put the defence of
our civil rights above a quick elec-
toral buck. The potential ramifica-
tions of the Bill were serious: since
the last Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act made certain forms of tres-
pass illegal, the surveillance of road
protesters would have been made
lawful under this Act. The free
admission by a number of Chief
Constables that the powers would be
used covertly to bug defendants and
their lawyers in the middle of a crim-
inal trial is quite horrifying, let alone
the fact that anyone seeking legal
advice from the same lawyer is like-
ly to have their conversations taped
for good measure. The current draft
(even with Opposition amendments)
left the police so much scope to
define "serious" crime that they
could have justified bugging anyone
daring to cross their path. Their eager
support for an outside commissioner
to scrutinise their decisions suggests
just how toothless this watchdog
could have been.
So what is the solution to all this?
Mr Howard's was obvious: all power
to the police - and on the off-chance
that they make a mistake, the
Surveillance Commissioner will be
there the pick up the pieces. From Mr
Howard's almost daily scribblings in
various national newspapers, it
appears that his main problems with
judges granting the power to bug
premises would be that it would take
too long and that "the police would
be inhibited". This is the whole point.
Judges already have a role in decid-
ing whether sensitive material held
by doctors or journalists can be
searched, and such a system can eas-
ily be extended to cover bugging.
The judiciary is there to safegaurd us
from rampant legislators. Allowing
judges the right to clear bugging
operations has the support of almost
all affected parties, would be in line
with present practice, and even has
the backing of Liberty, the civil
rights organisation. As one
Conservative peer said : "this new
power is one step down a slippery
path".
The solution to Mr Howard's
problems was found for him by the
Lords, when Labour and the Lib
Dems united to throw out this key
part of the Bill. Although the
Commons could attempt to bypass
the Lords, their wafer-thin majority
means Labour could defeat it and
then call a vote of no confidence in
the Government, possibly precipitat-
ing a General Election. With the
Government popularity at its present
level, and Mr Howard's own margin-
al seat in the Commons, I doubt he'll
be taking the risk.
