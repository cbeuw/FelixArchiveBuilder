LETTERS TO FELIX

Bookstore saga
rumbles on
Dear Felix,
Your editorial in Felix 1075 on the
bookstore situation asks "to what
lengths would you have been pre-
pared to go". I ask what lengths can
the Union go to now? There are sev-
eral good book shops in Kensington
High Street, and a great deal accessi-
ble by public transport in central
London. Since the only unique fea-
ture of Waterstones (IC) appears to
be books, is there any real need to
use it at all? A sufficient lack of cus-
tomers would obviously cause any
outside firm to pull out eventually.
The choice of who runs the book-
store makes little practical difference
to me personally. In particular I have
always regarded Waterstones as one
of the better book shops. It seems
that the union might have been hard
done by,,and I wonder how much it
wants to fight further.
Yours sincerely,
E.J.Hutton
This attitude - which basically
amounts to a boycott of the new
Waterstone's in all but name - has
already been suggested by many,
and certainly would be a clear way
to force the College's hand.
However, for this plan to be suc-
cessful the vast majority of IC stu-
dents would need to shun the new
bookstore, and, quite frankly, with
exams imminent and gaps in lec-
ture notes looming large, the com-
pulsion to finally buy some course
texts may prove stronger than
principles.
Yet, to be able to exercise any
real power over College, the Union
needs the power to believably
threaten action - even if none is
taken. If the Rector had truly
believed that the Union had the
power to organise an effective boy-
cott (or any other effective protest
for that matter) then this decision
would never have been made in the
first place. The threat of action is a
far more potent weapon than any
single act.

A G O O D CAREER M O V E
Like many of Imperial's students
who are coming to the end of their
final year here, I am engaged in a
long, drawn out struggle to discover
what it is that I shall be doing after
the summer is over. The options are
quite varied, and the yawning chasm
that is the end of conventional edu-
cation is quite wide. It is a daunting
task, yet also quite a rewarding one.
The selection process established
by many companies over a great
number of years of interview and
intake often becomes as revealing to
the applicant as to the employer.
Complex and wordy forms designed
to eke the best example of your cun-
ning in group situations or your
finest hour of leadership make you
think about what you have actually
done in the twenty or so years previ-
ously.
Never before has there been an
opportunity to find out what makes
you tick (unless you are already a
regular on the psychiatrist's couch)
as when a psychometric test is waft-
ed under your nose. These crafty
documents aim to find out your true
personality by asking lots of similar
comparative questions (just in case
you are cheating). Just as valuable is
the post-rejection analysis of why
your application failed, if you can
face talking to that particular compa-
ny again.
Not everyone, of course, rushes to
find themselves a career or even a
job. Further study, 'travelling' or a
deliberate spell of unemployment
also occupy the "what are you doing
now" files of graduates. Whatever it
may be that you end up doing, the
end of your final year and the slide
into 'the real world' can be a major
occasion.
Now, however, I open another
brochure and fill in another form
with little snippets from my past.
