I am saddened that Guilds Union
should have to get such bad press
because of the actions of its President
and other officers. To take F E L I X
away from the distribution points is
unforgiveable, especially after so
many people put so much effort into
getting the thing out on time in the
first place. N o matter how many
problems the Print Unit has gone
through, we have always got F E L I X
out to students on Friday morning,
even if we have to go without sleep
to do it. The action by those people
was purely a crude act of censorship.
Having said this, I must apologise
to Dave Osbourne and Murray
Williamson for the advert I included
last week. I genuinely thought that
that advert was 100 times better than
the one which would have originally
gone in. They just submitted a few
words on a bit of paper for an eighth
of a page advert. I wanted people to
go to the Guilds Carnival so I wanted
the publicity to be good. I am sorry
that I included the snide comment at
the bottom of the advert, but is that
any reason to steal all the copies of
F E L I X on Friday morning?
Let's hope that the matter can now
be forgotten. I have apologised and
Dave Tyler has apologised. I only
wish to add that if everything in
F E L I X , not only the news, contained
no opinion it would be very boring
indeed. M y editorial policy still
remains: an entertaining newspaper
that contains an independent view on
events around College, independent
but tongue-in-cheek news items and
informative articles. I'll let nobody
change that policy.

printing difficulties throughout this
term. It has been necessary to cut
down the number of pages to 20 from
24. W e had more than enough
material to fill double that! If your
article, letter or small ad has been
missed out or edited, I have to
apologise, but some things just had
to go to make room for the articles
we had to include. No doubt you will
find articles in this issue which are far
less interesting that the one you
submitted. I have to make decisions
on number of pages, articles to
include, where to put them, etc, on
Monday afteroon. This is why there
is a deadline for any contribution on
Monday lunchtime. If I don't know
about your article before then, it
won't go in. Occasionally we may
have a small space left by Tuesday
night or even Wednesday morning but
this is a rare occurence. As a rule, i f
you don't want your article to be
edited down it is best to edit it
yourself before you send it in. Try
and keep reports down to 200 words
if possible. If you cannot hand in an
article, eg Union Officer's report, by
Monday lunchtime then please tell me
and we can arrange a different
deadline. I do not appreciate people
who ring on Wednesday afternoon
asking i f they can have a report in
Friday's F E L I X .
Next Week's FELIX
This is going to be mega! I've had to
tell so many people to bring their
articles back next week that I'm going
to have to start production today.
Even if you've told me you intend to
write something, please tell me again
so I can plan the issue this evening.
Monday's deadline is the last possible
time to submit anything as we start
printing Tuesday morning.
Misunderstanding
So many people have come up to me
and asked i f I'm talking to Ian
Howgate y e t — B i l l G o o d w i n ' s
opinion article gave completely the
wrong impression—I have always
been talking to Ian. The 'Cold War'
has been created by certain Union
Offficers who do not talk to F E L I X .
Why did I print the article?
Because I see no need to stifle
criticism, however misguided it is.
Survey
I attribute the bad response to our
survey to three things:
• The fact that it was not made clear
that A is to be answered by everyone,
B by males only and C by females
only. Congratulations if you filled in
all sections.
• That nobody know how to use the
internal mail system—just put your
answers on a piece of paper, place the
paper in an envelope, put FELIX,
Beit Quad on the envelope and give
it to the messenger (the guy who sits
in the cubicle by the entrance to your
department). Voila.
• Apathy, again.
Thieves
We distribute F E L I X free to all
members of Imperial College Union
on the understanding that each person
takes one copy only. We have very
little money so we can't produce
enough copies for every member of
College to have a copy. I frown on
departments who take copies of
F E L I X to give to sixth formers who
come for interviews—I know that this
is happening as I've seen members of
staff taking 30 or 40 away at a time.
Some have the decency to come to the
Office and ask for copies. It's very
flattering that College should want
F E L I X to use as a promotion for
College and the Union but it's just not
on. Each extra copy costs us 15p to
produce, so please let the limited
copies available go to those for whom
they are intended.
