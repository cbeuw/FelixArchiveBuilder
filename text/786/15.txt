IRISH
Collecting
We are currently collecting names in
the hope that it will lead to the
formation of an Irish Society. The
general aim will be to bring together
anyone with an interest in Ireland
although our precise aims have been
left open. A s such, we are open to
constructive suggestions. If you are
interested in a traditional Irish
barnight o r something more
intellectual, please contact one of us
via the appropriate pigeonhole.

GREATER L O N D O N
Good times
The Greater London Club was started
this term with the intent of showing
students how to have a good time in
London without necessarily becoming
victims of the city's expense. We try
to maintain a balance between serious
and not-so-serious events, and now
have over 120 members.
The events we have lined up for the
rest of this term and the next include
a tour round the B B C T V Centre,
visits to the City of London and a
national newspaper, and an evening
at a greyhound race meeting as well
as several bands and cabaret/fringe
theatre venues. We are aiming at 2
events per week until Easter, and
always arrange for concessions and/or
provide club subsidies.
We do not profess to know
everything that is going on and
welcome suggestions from all our
members. W e have an informal
meeting every Friday at lpm in the
Senior Common Room (above
Norman's) but can also be contacted
via Phil Adams or Rob Conn (both
Chem Eng IV).

QT
Freak
It is the dawn of time. Earth has just
been created. A freak cosmic ray
bonds some atoms together which
spontaneously evolve into the Kama-
Sutra, the Chaircreature of what is
now Q T Soc. Comprehending the
effect of its existence on humanity (on
the off-chance that it too would come
into being) it hid under a rock for
millions of years, reproducing by
binary fission and watching furry,
banana-eating, tree-dwelling creatures
evolve into almost hairless, bipedal
animals whose idea of fun was getting
pissed at parties.
Continued next week...
We meet at 1300 hrs every Tuesday
in Southside Upper Lounge or
Belushi's depending on how hungry
I am. Everybody is welcome, Be
there!!!

Fighting spirit
On Saturday 21st November the '17th
Portsmouth Invitation Karate
Tournament' was held at the
Mountbatten Centre, Portsmouth.
There were 500-600 competitors, and
IC was represented by a 13-strong
team, trained and coached by Ceasar
Andrews (3rd Dan). Together the
team won ten trophies.
The competition involved kumite
(sparring) and kata (fixed forms) and
there were creditable performances all
round. The ladies stole the day with
Maiken Engelstad coming first in the
kata competition with a spectacular
execution of 'seienshin' and being
asked to demonstrate her kata again
after the finals. Kate Taylor came
third, and both ladies came joint third
in the kurnite. In the men's kata
competition Paul Potter came a
respectable third with 'sochin' and the
men's team (P Potter, Kenrick Sayers
and Oday Abbosh) achieved fourth
place. In the junior individual men's
kumite Paul Urbonas and Michael
James came joint third. Recognition
must be given to those who didn't
reach the final but fought strongly and
with good spirit. The men's kumite
team A reached the quarter-finals
where after a hard struggle they were
defeated.
In closing I wish to thank all those
who took part for their dedication,
and Ceasar Andrews for his guidance.
WINDSURFING
Shaky start
Two members of IC Windsurfing
Club competed in this week's race in
the Carlsberg Cooler series. This was
held at Datchet Water on Saturday
21st November.
After numerous detours including
an unintentional circular tour of the
reservoir the club captain found the
entrance and was rigged in time for
the first race. Being faced with 132
competitors including some of the
country's top semi-professional
sailors the two members got off to a
shaky start, both lying between 25 and
30. The best three results from the
day's four races were taken. Despite
the light and variable wind, least
favourable to the equipment used,
Club Captain Robert Kent finished
15th and Mark Gilanze finished
31st—especially good considering he
was using unfamiliar kit.
