IC II—5
New College II—1
With the IC team containing 6
players, either making their debut, or
having only played 1 game for the
2nds, it may have looked a difficult
game on paper, to the ordinary fan.
But, with an inspirational team talk
by captain for the day, Russ Dark,
and the fact that we play on grass,
caused IC to play like a team
possessed. After early pressure,
Graham Day was in the right place
at the right time, to give IC the lead.
New College put pressure on IC for
the equaliser, but a hasty clearence
was headed through by Talib Araim,
who had the vision to see Guy Phiri
running through. Guy doesn't miss
them, so IC went 2 goals up. Shortly
after good work by Guy in the right,
the ball was crossed, and some how,
Neil Vanden Begin converted a
difficult volley, to put IC 3 up.
The second half was going to be
tough, against the wind, and this was
shown when New College got a goal
back. However, IC's character
showed through, and shortly after,
Guy Phiri scored the goal of the
match. Having beaten two players on
the edge of the box, he cut inside, beat
two more, rounded the keeper, and
blasted IC into a 4-1 lead. Then,
Graham Day popped up again to
round off a fine IC display, keeping
IC II at the top of the league.

IC (lst team)—2
U C (lst team)—0
The game was dominated by the
windy conditions preventing either
team from playing entertaining
football. IC started in a sluggish
manner, giving U C a lot of time on
the ball and letting them dominate the
game. Gradually IC got back into the
game creating a few chances. A
sloopy back pass from one of U C ' s
defenders left Nigel Collier with just
the goalie to beat which he did to put
IC into the lead.
IC continued to battle against the
elements in the second half. IC's
defence were having one of their best
games of the season not allowing U C
to break through.
In the 70th minute IC were awarded
a penalty when Paul was brought
down inside the box. Phil Ewart took
the penalty and scored only for the
referee to disallow it because someone
entered the penalty box before the ball
was kicked. Phil Ewart retook the
penalty and scored. The final score
was 2-0. It was IC's first clean sheet
of the season.
Judith says 'this is the worse paste-up
she's ever seen' (Judith is 28).
