Small star
fills a
hole
Astronomy is an inexact science.
Theories are considered good if they
get answers within an order of
magnitude of observations. Factors of
a hundred are considered worrysome.
So astronomers have had a lot of
trouble with the mass of the universe.
Observations of the motion of stars
and galaxies suggest that the mass of
the universe is about one hundred
times larger than the mass of all the
observed objects added up.
Lots of theories have been proposed
to explain the missing mass, though
none has suggested that it has been
stolen. Astronomers have been fond
of straying into particle physics to find
their lost weight: massive neutrinos
were one popular suggestion. But,
actual experiments have consistently
kept any mass hidden in the neutrino
very small indeed. It would be better
if astronomers didn't have to appeal
to particle physics to solve their
problems (partially because it's a very
difficult subject and causes them
enormous amounts of mental strain).
Some recent observations seem to
be filling in the holes. A,n indirect
observation of the infrared radiation
from the white dwarf star Giclas
29-38 (this is the star's telephone
number) suggests it has a cold but
large companion. Theoretical
estimates suggest that the companion
has a temperature of about 1,200 K
and is about 4 to 8 % the mass of the
Sun. This puts it right on the
borderline between stars and planets.
The observation is important for
various reasons. Brown dwarfs have
been popular candidates for some of
the missing mass for some time, but
they have never been observed
before. They are objects just not quite
big enough to get seriously into
nuclear fusion. Theory is a bit poor
at predicting exactly what size they
should be or exactly how many of
them there should be. So, now that
we can see them if we know what to
look for, astronomers can refine their
theories with actual observations. If
there are lots of them they may well
end up accounting for a lot of the
unseen mass that so bedevels
observational astronomy. (Nature 330

UNDER THE
MICROSCOPE
by Steve Black
Editorial-science & values
There has been some criticism of last
week's comment on the state of things
with Star Wars. It was a rather
opinionated piece, and some people
have argued that there is no place for
such opinions in a page about science
(please note that the article did contain
a lot of facts taken from the scientific
press; Woodruff's case has received
a large amount of publicity in Nature,
for example). This objection seems to
imply that the world of science stands
entirely apart from the world o f
values: that is, there is no place within
science for the discussion of the uses
of science. I disagree, and it is worth
explaining why.
Perhaps the most important thing
connecting the world of morality and
the world o f science is the
requirement f o r truthfulness i n
scientific work: unless scientists
report their results accurately science
cannot continue.
It is probably not surprising that,
in a society increasingly dominated by
the ethic of individualism and self-
advancement, scientific fraud is on the
increase. Several recent cases have
come to light (see Nature 329 p377).
Most were caused because scientists
are increasingly judged by how much
work they produce, so the workers in
question improved their publication
record by inventing a few extra
results. These cases have caused a
good deal of worry in the world of
science, because they diminish the
trust that is necessary for science to
work. Policing the world of science
is impossible, so we have to rely on
the honesty of individuals.
The public and the state also rely
on the honesty of the experts who give
them advice. This trust is severely
damaged when scientists allow
themselves to be bought by particular
interests. The interests of the food
industry are not always compatible
with our health, so we need honest
independent experts to oppose the
effects of junk food advertising. We
would still think that tobacco was O K
if there had not been honest
individuals who were willing to stand
up against the huge industry and say
that fags cause cancer. Where would
we be if rich companies could prevent
the truth emerging by bribing the
experts?
Scientists increasingly have to make
more important judgements about the
implications of their work. Scientists
who leave such questions for the
politicians are abdicating their
responsibilities. They are the moral
equivalents of the scientists who used
concentration camp victims as
convenient Guineapigs for horrendous
experiments. Scientists have to
become more like Woodruff and start
challenging those w h o make
misleading claims for their work.
More than that they have to start
asking themselves i f their work is
morally justified at all. Star Wars is
a good example. There are good
reasons for supposing it will upset the
balance of power, making war more
likely. There are even better reasons
why it is unlikely to work at all. The
scientists who know this but continue
to take the (vast amounts of) money,
are guilty of dereliction of their moral
duty. A t the very least they are
wasting large amounts o f public
money that would be better spent
elsewhere; worse they could be
encouraging politicians to think that
war is fightable.
Scientists who are not guided by
any ethical considerations are bad for
science and dangerous to society.
They are not going to be taught ethics
at Imperial C o l l e g e , where
conformism is the ideal. So this
column will do its best to maintain
some sort of balance and, when
ethical issues arise, will not hesitate
to discuss them. You are, of course,
entitled to disagree with my
conclusions, and their contrary
opinions on any subject.
Radiation
is worse
than we
thought
Patent medicines containing
radioactive mixtures used to be
popular (some of them glowed in the
dark). People simply did not know
what exposure to ionising radiation
did to the body. Nowadays we know
just how nasty most forms of radiation
are. For example, when you have an
X-ray taken at a hospital, the
radiographer has to hide behind a lead
shield.
Much of our information on just
how nasty radiation can be, comes
from studies of the long term effects
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Not
everyone who was near the two
explosions has died yet, so we have
not yet obtained reliable information
on the long term effects of low doses
of radiation. However, the latest
results are disturbing since they
suggest that previous estimates
seriously underestimated the long
term dangers of radiation.
The National R a d i o l o g i c a l
Protection Board has called for
dramatic reductions in the exposure
of workers to radiation. The amount
of radiation exposure allowed is to be
reduced soon by a factor of three in
those working in nuclear plants. This
seems likely to cause major problems
for the nuclear industry, which will
have to spend vast sums of money
increasing protection for its workers
It seems that the more wefindout
about radiation the worse it gets
Sooner or later the electricity industry
will have to ask whether atomic
power is worth the trouble. It will do
it sooner rather than later if the
Government privatises the nuclear
power stations with the rest of the
industry.
