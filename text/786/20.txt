continued from front page
improving this week. In a letter to
Publications Board Chair Chris!
Martin, M r Tyler apologised for the
removal of F E L I X , but was adamant
that he had been right to make a
protest. At the I C U Exec meeting on
Wednesday, M r Tyler proposed that
all the students involved, including
himself, should pay a fine. They have
agreed to give up time to collect for
Rag. Later, Miss Hackney received
a large bunch of flowers from M r
Tyler. Unfortunately, this arrived
after page 5 had gone to press (See
Libel).
M r Tyler said yesterday: T feel it
achieved what was necessary,
although we all wish we had had an
alternative method of achieving it'.
The last time F E L I X was stolen
was in 1981, when nearly all copies
of Steve Marshall's end of year issue
disappeared. The culprit was never
brought to justice (but it was either
the I C U President of the day, John
Passmore, or a member of the
Masons).
Gawd me nuts please,
John!
The 'Godiva' Run, made by members of the RCSU Motor Club last
weekend, raised around £350.
No more tenure for staff
Education Secretary Kenneth Baker
has announced in his Education
Reform Bill that newly appointed
University staff will no longer be
given tenure. This means that there
will no longer be special protection
against dismissal on grounds of
redundancy or financial exigency.
The Bill provides that staff currently
in posts that have tenure will retain
it as long as they continue in their
present appointments. This means that
staff will lose tenure when they are
promoted and tenure will be phased
universities in Great Britain. The Bill
provides for the establishment of a
Universities Funding Council (UFC)
to replace the non-statutory
University Grants Committee. The
U F C will have 15 members to be
appointed by the Secretary of State.
Six to nine members will come from
higher education and the remainder
will come from other backgrounds.
This special council will administer
all funds provided by the Government
for universities but the Secretary of
State has the power to attach terms
out as quickly as possible.
He also announced that he wishes
to establish new arrangements for
central government funding for the
and conditions to the funds he
rovides. The U F C will, however, be
independent of Government and have
a powe: to appoint its own staff.
PG halls
Postgraduate halls will be discussed
at Tuesday's U G M , following the
final meeting o f the U n i o n
Accommodation Committee last
Tuesday. Postgrads in residence will
be asked whether they would have
preferred to have a place i n
postgraduate only o r mixed
accommodation. The results will be
taken to an extraordinary meeting of
the Committee on Monday evening
prior to the U G M the next day.
Other subjects discussed at the
Committee included a new College
Financial Advisor, a general survey
of students and the temperature of
Linstead Hall showers.
This house
believes...
The third Union General Meeting of
the Imperial College Union will take
place next Tuesday in the JCR. Two
motions have already been submitted
for debate. One is to promote the
rights of Palestinian students at the
Bethlehem Univers;
ty and the other
is a motion on postgraduate halls.
Money for
old Rag
Last week's Rag Week raised a record
£10,840 for the five Rag charities.
Rag Chairman, Nigel Baker was 'well
chuffed' with the amount raised. He
confidently expects last year's Rag
total to be exceeded by Christmas.
The Beer Festival raised the highest
individual total with £2,100 spent on
beer and glasses, £800 on Rag Mags,
£95 on Scout and Guide Burgers and
£40 from Chap:, curries.
Chas Brereton's Piano Marathon
raised a provisional £1,500 and the
Hypnosis Lecture £960. Other totals
include the Guilds Slave Auction
(£610), Dirty Disco (£500), Smoking
Concert (£400), Carnival (£800) and
Rag & Drag (£230).

temporarily repair it.
