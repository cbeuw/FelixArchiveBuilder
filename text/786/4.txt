Hello, my name is Helen Fitzpatrick
and I am writing as this year's
Postgraduate Affairs Officer
(PGAO). You may not be aware that
IC has a Postgraduate group which
should:
1. Represent postgraduates within
ICU and the College.
-2. Provide social activities for
postgraduates in the College.
3. Provide finance for departmental
postgraduate groups.
Presently the committee is two
members strong with both members
from the same department. T o
prevent the committee from allocating
the entire budget (your money) to our
own department the vacant positions
on the committee must befilled.A n y
one who is interested in becoming a
committee member, a departmental
representative, or even just lending an
occasional hand should drop me a
note.
All ideas or suggestions relating to
postgraduates within Imperial, will be
gratefully received. Send them to
P G A A O , Union Office.

Have you been burgled recently? Last
Monday (16th), at least forty-two
people were. Fortunately it was only
by the zany Welfare Team who were
going round IC halls and houses,
trying the doors of all the rooms.
The wardens were very enthusiastic
about the campaign, all being very
keen to improve security. But we're
all fighting a losing battle i f people
don't take responsibility for the safety
of their own belongings. Not only can
you not complain if someone takes
things from your unlocked room,
you'll have difficulty getting any
insurance on it. Never let anyone you
don't know into the building either
and keep outside doors locked.
I'd like to thank all the wardens,
subwardens, Geoff Reeves, 'burglers'
and residents very much for all their
help.
Love, Pippa.

The Society for Lesbian & Gay
Students have noticed that most
posters put up on the premises
advertising their meetings are
invariably torn down. This, of course,
is a sign not only of intolerance, but
also of extreme ignorance.
However, perhaps this desicration
of posters is carried out mostly by
those who feel rather guilty about
their own sexuality!

Sometime over the weekend,
someone removed the election papers
for first year council reps from my
noticeboard in the Union Building
Foyer. I would dearly like to have
these back before Monday so that I
can run the election at the U G M .
Otherwise I will have to go through
the whole procedure again, wasting
both my time and that of the
candidates. If they are returned to the
Union Office I will drop this matter.
