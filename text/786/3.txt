Housing Benefit after
April 1988
In April 1988 the Social
Security Act 1986 will
come into force,
introducing fundamental
changes to the whole
social security system,
including the Housing
Benefit on which students
are so reliant. College
Welfare Advisor Linda
Simmons tries to explain...
First the good news: there is at
present no proposal to abolish
Housing Benefit for students. So most
people receiving benefit before April
1988 will continue on benefit after
April, but the amount paid will be
less.
One of the purposes of the new
rules is to 'unify' the way help is
given for housing costs for all
claimants. At present the rules for
eligibility to Housing Benefit are
different f o r those claiming
Supplementary Benefit and those who
claim Standard Housing Benefit from
the appropriate local authority. Most
students are in the second category
and claim during term time and short
vacations.
In April 1988 Supplementary
Benefit will disappear, to be replaced
by Income Support. The basis for
assessing the amount of Housing
Benefit will be the same as that used
for assessing Income Support.
Therefore, as the rules for Income
Support treat under-25s less
favourably than those over 25, most
students will have housing bnefit
assessed under these less favourable
rules. Another change is that a full
rate rebate will no longer be possible.
Under the new rules the maximum
UlUtravel
allowed will be 80% of the eligible
rates. There will be some adjustment
to allow for this in the amount of
Income Support, but for those
receiving Housing Benefit alone, it
will mean a reduction in allowable
rebate.
The amount deducted from the
eligible rent for students will also
apply (currently £17.80 in London).
In fact almost all the special rules
which relate to calculating student
Housing Benefit will be carried over
into the new Scheme (eg treatment of
grants and covenants, eligibility of
overseas students etc).
The table below gives some
examples of the possible effect. The
figures are reproduced just as a
guideline—the Government has not
yet announced the exact figures which
will apply in April 1988, only
suggested examples which have been
used in the calculations.
For the first time a capital cut-off
is going to be introduced to assess
eligibility to Housing Beneift. Under
the present scheme only interest or
other income earned from savings is
taken into account. The capital cut-
off for Housing Benefit and Income
Support will be £6000 with a
reduction made to entitlement on any
capital between £3000 and £6000. A s
with the present rules on
Supplementary Benefit, any capital
less than £3000 will be disregarded.
The last time major changes to the
Housing Benefit system were
introduced was April 1983. The result
was utter chaos in local authorities
everywhere. This time, the changes
are in many ways even greater. Local
authorities face an additional
workload and have little extra time to
prepare for the changeover. It also
looks as if they will not be given
enough money to set up the new
system. It could well be that similar
problems as those experienced in
1983 could be repeated, with massive
delays and serious administrative
errors contributing to claimants'
misery.
So be on your guard if you claim
Housing Benefit after April 1988 and
don't receive when you expect them.
Check at once with your local
authority or come and see me. The
same applies if you are unsure about
anything to do with Housing Beneift
or any other benefit.
The system is horrendously
complex and I'll always do my best
to try to make the intricacies clearer.
