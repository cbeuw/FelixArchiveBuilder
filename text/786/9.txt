Africa
comes to
Imperial
One of the best bands to appear at IC
for many years is happening—that's
the only way to describe it—on 3rd
December as the main attraction of
the Christmas Party. Read on for the
low down on a group who are even
now being plugged by no less a
person than John Peel.
If anyone out there thinks that
thirteen is an unlucky number, they
had better change their ideas a bit
smartish, because the thirteen
members of The Real Sounds O f
Africa will have something to say
about it. Originally from Zambia, and
now based in Zimbabwe, this bands
blend of infectious African energy
with their own version of the latin
polyrhythms of the rhumba has
moved those other denizens of the
music world, the Bhundu Boys to say:
'Real Sounds? They're better than
us....' High praise indeed.
This band is no newcomer to the
musical scene, and can claim to have
been around longer than, say, Dire
Straits; they formed in Zambia in
1975, moving to Zimbabwe three
years later, although their first L P ,
Harare, wasn't released until the
group was celebrating its tenth
anniversary. The basic musical form
is that of the soukous, an African
derivation of the rhumba which is
thought to have been brought back
from the Cuban end of the Carribean.
That, and group member Jozos
explanation, 'We are trying to play
Zairean music with a Zimbabwean
flavour', will probably leave you as
much in the dark as it did me, but the
success of the formula can easily be
judged: The Real Sounds' residency,
the Seven Miles Hotel in Harare seats
1000, and playing there three nights
per week the band fill it to the top.
Every single night. For those of you
unlucky enough to miss them when
they appeared on last week's South
Bank Show, this is what they are
about. Twelve musicians, playing
sax, snare, lead and bass guitars and
tons of percussion, together with
vocals which at first hearing seem
simple, but soon reveal their subtle
and complex harmonies, all blended
into an exotic mix - the only people
who can resist dancing are those who
are put off their stroke by the
refreshing lack of a heavy beatbox
bass.
So, that's twelve: how about the
thirteenth? Bring on the Witch
Doctor! No kidding, his name is
Mashura Nzou, and in addition to his
interest in alternative medicine he
must be one of the most flexible
contortionists going. His inclusion in
the show isn't mere kitsch, either: one
of the main pieces has as its focus the
death of an entire village, and its
magical revival, and those who have
seen this live will tell you that it really
works.
All in all, an amazing concept, and
on top of that they are football crazy
as well and they sing a song about
it. Don't miss 'em.
The Christmas Party starts at 9pm
and there are free mince piesfor the
first hundred people. Tickets are £2
in advance and can be purchased
from Norman's Snack Bar or the ICU
Office. Alternatively, if you bring this
page along to the party, you can get
in for only £2 on the door. (If you
don't you'll be charged £2.50).
FELIX Friday November 27th 1987 9
