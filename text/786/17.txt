C&G Success
C & G Rugby have been playing in the
U A U as an IC 3rd X V this term. The
first part of the U A U was a league
competition in which C & G finished
top of their league, not losing a game,
with wins over Surrey (4-18), Brunei
(24-0) and Kent (12-16).
The first match against Surrey saw
the loss of our scrum half Graig
Allery with a broken wrist. The game
started slowly with us taking most of
the first half to assert our authority,
after which we stormed away to put
18 points on our opponents.
Our second match was against
Brunei, this game was played in
appalling weather conditions. In the
first quarter of the game, we were
kept behind our own 22 yard line, and
all credit to the team for preventing
Brunei from scoring at this crucial
point in the game. When we finally
managed to make headway against the
gale force wind, we scored two tries
before half-time, and then after the
break we changed up a gear as the
opposition crumbled and a further 4
tries were scored. We ended the
match with an injury to our vice-
captain Steve Holden with damaged
ribs, he has been unable to play since.
Our third and final game in the
league was against Kent, this game
kicked off at 12.30pm, too early for
some! After a period of prolonged
pressure against Kent in the first half
we scored 2 tries and then relaxed.
At the beginning of the second half
our over-confident attitude allowed us
to concede two very dubious tries,
this managed to motivate the team
into action again to reply by scoring
twice in as many minutes. The game
ended with Kent squeezing in with a
last minute try.
M y congratulations go out to all the
C & G lst X V players, who have
played well and made these results
possible, taking us into the last 16
teams in the U A U .
Ladies Foiled Again!
Fencing
Last Saturday saw the debut of the
ladies fencing team against Kings
College. It is the first time we've been
able to raise a ladies team for a few
years. We were very pleased with the
results especially against Kings who
have always been very tough
opponents. The results for the day are
as follows:
Ladies' Foil IC 4 - 5 Kings
Men's Sabre IC 3—6 Kings
Men's Epee IC 9—0 Kings
Men's Foil IC 9 - 0 Kings
Everyone put up a really good fight
on both sides. Adam Sadler, who
recently achieved 4th place in the
National U20 Epee Competition, won
all his 6 fights for the foil and epee
teams as did Peter Cripwell. Adam's
performance was particularly
impressive since he was still
recovering from a heavy dose of
cocktails from the Guilds Carnival.
The most embarrassing incident of
the day saw one member of the ladies'
team having to be prized out of her
electric jacket by two fencers having
broken the zip. She then discovered
that her body wire (which goes up one
sleeve of the jacket and down the
back) was broken. One bright spark
of a fancer decided to tie a second
body wire to the first and pull it
through. O f course, it got stuck half
way! The next five minutes saw the
highly embarrassed lady in question
sorrounded by six eager lads all trying
to rectify the situation. Needless to
say she still went on to fence a very
good match!
Belle Vue Cycling
Cycling
The annual Belle Vue C . C . cross-
country running race for cyclists took
place on Sunday in cold, windy
conditions. The South London
Harriers' tough, hilly course always
attracts a quality field of both cyclists
and triathletes.
Heavy rainfall the previous night
made for extremely muddy
conditions, and turned the event into
a severe test of strength and stamina.
Sole IC entrant Andy Major
produced a sound 32-minute run, for
32nd place in a strong field of 108
finishers. Recent IC graduate Scott
Heyhow achieved a creditable 33-50
(43rd place) running for his new club,
C.C. Woking. International triathlete
Peter Moysey faild to start, and the
overall winner was ex-professional
cyclist Pete Sanders with an
astounding 26-51.
Forthcoming events include an
eleven mile walking race and a
25-mile time-trial in December.
Should
be fun

Woadwunners
Orienteering
Last Sunday's event was at the Forest
of Dean in Bristol. Despite rain on the
journey there and a torrential storm
the forest remained dry and orienteers
were able to complete their courses
in comparatively fast times. Men ran
the blue course with 350m of climb
and ladies the green course. When the
results come through, positions within
the Club will be able to be calculated
for those competitive orienteers.
Next weekend there is a night event
on Saturday; followed by a badge
event in Nottingham and a colour-
coded event in Ashridge on the
Sunday. Anyone interested in coming
along should come to training on
Thursday this week at 6.30pm in the
Union Foyer for an 'O' sprint around
College—should be fun!
Jonnie Rotten
It was Wednesday the 18th. Jonnie
Turner was feeling proud of himself.
He looked in the mirror and saw his
rugged handsome features staring
back at him. Yes, he was certainly
losing his hair, but then again, four
years of Mech Eng would do the same
to anyone. He picked up the newly
washed kit, re-checked his receding
hairline and headed towards Beit
Quad. Jonnie was ready to take the
IC fifths to Wembley.
It was now 12.43pm and slowly the
team drifted towards the noticeboard.
They always enjoyed their days out
in the country with Jonnie or
'Grandpa' as they had fondly
nicknamed him. He would take them
on all sorts of trains, to places where
no man had been before, to meet
people who no man would want to
have met before. But these days were
always full of fun because Grandpa
Jonnie would always find himself in
trouble for one reason or another.
Today, Jonnie lent his rail card to
Glen so that Glen could swindle 70p
off his ticket (stingy git). What Jonnie
forgot was that Glen didn't look
anything like Jonnie's photo. For a
start Glen was not bald, did not have
a six inch nose and most importantly
was not an old age pensioner!
Eventually Jonnie got slapped wrists
and got his senior citizens' card back.
2.30pm. Cobham town (where?).
The whole team felt like a right bunch
of Richard Heads because we'd
turned up at the match without a ball.
So, whilst the other side were having
Welay
Cross-Country
Last weekend saw us at the Warwick
Woadwunners Welay. The course
was a tight and fairly flat circuit of
2.2 miles on the roads around the
campus. A below par team did well
to finish 7th in a small field of 12
teams. The race was won by Leicester
only one second ahead of the team
from Warwick. A n enjoyable day
nonetheless, made even more so by
the fact that Stuart finally got to use
his umbrella! Thanks Stuart.
Our next race is at Reading where
we take part in the White Knights
Relays followed by the University of
London Championships at Alexandra
Palace. C'mon everyone let's have a
good turnout for the U L champs
(especially the girls!).
(Football!?)
a kick-about, we amused ourselves by
watching Bah dribbling with an
imaginary ball for half an hour.
After wasting early chances, Bas
managed to put IC in the lead after
25 minutes. From then on IC just sat
back and soaked up the pressure as
flood after flood of attack was thrown
at them. (By the way, we were
playing Charing Cross Hospital III).
At right back, Mike was brilliant.
Pete and Jon were great at the centre
of defence and at left back Glen was
solid and often sensational. In goal,
Steve just sort of floated around really
doing pretty much nothing (no, he
didn't tip the penalty onto the bar)
looking very lost. A solid midfield of
Dave, Lee, Tan, and Ean (well, let's
face it, neither Tan nor Ean are very
solid at all), and a stupendous attack
of Bas and Bah, who between them
had three shots on goal. Meanwhile
Steve was still wearing his newly
washed green jersey (I don't know
why we bother, it's never muddy).
Two minutes before the end, the
cheats hand-balled the ball and
scored. So, we had penalties, as it was
pitch dark. So dark, that we couldn't
even see Bah, except when he smiled.
Dave and Bas scored, quite clinically,
and at 2-2, Mike went up and just as
clinically missed. Jonnie was crying.
The Harlem Globe Trotters then
missed twice (no, Steve didn't even
touch the ball. They hit the bar quite
easily without his help.) Glenn and
Lee scored. We'd won 5-3. We were
on our way to Wembley.
