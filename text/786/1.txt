Catnapping
Students who paid 20p for a copy of FELIX when they were sold for Rag
at the Smoking Concert must have felt very pleased with themselves on
Friday morning. By that time the paper was in very short supply. Members
of Guilds Union had stolen three thousand copies from the distribution
points. After tense discussions between FELIX Editor Judith Hackney,
Guilds President David Tyler and Guilds Vice President Tanya Maule,
all the FELIXs were returned to the usual sites.

Caught in the act
The 'raid' was organised by M r
Tyler as a protest against material
published in last week's F E L I X and
in other recent editions. M r Tyler felt
that some news stories concerning
Guilds Union had not been reported
fairly. In his opinion, the story about
the theft of Dramsoc's ladder had
incorrectly implied that the ladder had
been stolen by Guilds. He was also
upset that last Friday's F E L I X had
Putting them back
attacked the organisation of Guilds
Carnival and carried advertising
which he thought would discourage
students from attending. M r Tyler felt
that this was in contravention of a
I C U Council ruling, which states that
Rag events should receive priority.
The F E L I X Editor is, however,
entirely independent of Council.
Miss Hackney first noticed the
disappearance of most of last week's
F E L I X s when she returned to the
Huxley building to deliver some
additional copies. She was told by the
Huxley messenger that the F E L I X s
had been removed by two students.
Suspecting a Guilds Rag stunt, Miss
Hackney and F E L I X staff member
Adrian Bourne surreptitiously took
photographs of two Guilds students
as they removed copies of the paper
which had been left in the Department
of Electrical Engineering. When
challenged over the disappearance of
F E L I X , M r Tyler admitted that
Guilds Union was responsible, but
said that the raid could not be
considered to be theft. H e stressed
that it was intended chiefly to avoid
any detrimental publicity f o r
Carnival. After stating his grievances,
M r Tyler agreed to replace the
missing copies of F E L l X , on the
condition that F E L I X donated Â£20 to
Rag. This request was refused, but all
the missing copies of F E L I X were
later returned on the instruction of
Miss Maule. F E L I X was in full
circulation by 11.00am.
The removal of nearly an entire
print run of F E L I X has caused bad
feeling in the F E L I X Office. Many
staff members had spent the whole of-
Wednesday night working to get the
edition ready for press. When F E L I X
is not distributed until after Friday
morning's lectures have begun, it has
generally been found that not all
students are able to collect copies.
The situation appears to have been
