With Christmas not too distant, the
T V channels are obviously saving
their best (?) for later. The B B C have,
however, celebrated the departure of
Michael Grade with four new series.
Old Favourites, Kenny Everett (8pm,
Monday) Dallas (8pm, Wednesday)
and A Question of Sport (8pm,
Thursday) all return, with a new
three-part thriller series, The
Marksman starting at 9.30pm a week
on Friday.
Blind Date ( I T V , 8.15pm,
Saturday) with its rehearsed lines is
really becoming tedious, but last
week's reached an all time low with
OAPs joining in. It certainly looks
like the programmes are encouraging
us to turn off our tellies 'and go and
do something less boring instead'.
And true to form M s Black is
followed by Ms Caine and New Faces
of '87 Live Grand Finale (ITV.
7.30pm, Saturday). Can anyone look
Marti Caine in the eye without
thinking about that cruel caricature on
Spitting Image! Things don't improve
much on Sunday unless of course the
Royal Variety Performance is of
interest (ITV, 7.15pm), though the
Birdman of Alcatraz ( B B C 2 ,
10.15pm) is always worth seeing
again.
Monday sees another in the series
of Woody Allen films, Sleeper
(BBC2, 9pm). Allen wakes up in the
year 2173, 200 years after going into
hospital for a routine ulcer operation
(and you thought the N H S waiting
lists were bad).
On a more serious note First
Tuesday (ITV, 10.30, Tuesday)
investigates racism in Alabama, 25
years after Martin Luther King spoke
of his dream of racial harmony.
Competition
The winner of last week's competition was Alistair Seymour with this
wonderful little gem. Collect your t-shirt from the Office today. Special
merit awards go to Phil Adams, K Wiles and Neil Boxall.
The Phantasmagoria
As is so often the case with
contemporary dance, a production is
not so much a story as a series of
sketches based on a theme. The
Phantasmagoria is no exception.
Originally, The Phantasmagoria
was a form of entertainment using a
'magic' lantern to produce illusions
and fantasies of the mind. The
London Contemporary Dance theatre
sets out to recreate some of this
mysticism. The opening scene,
Pandor's Box is a magical dance, lead
by a two-faced creature well
portrayed by Anita Griffin, displaying
the 'freaks' of the circus at the turn
of the 18th century. The effects are
well produced and the atmosphere is
built up immediately. The rest of the
first half of this production continues
in much the same vein, creating
beautiful illusions. M y particular
favourites were a glowing web with
a man trapped inside, a sketch with
a man in a smouldering suit and a
visually delightful sketch using
mirrors to multiply the apparent
number of people on stage. Just
before the safety curtain is lowered
JfAKE
Relative Strangers
Maureen Rissik (Penguin, £3.50)
Relative Strangers by Maureen Rissik
is a book for rainy afternoons (not
advised for exam week since it is
nearly impossible to put down).
Unlike many seemingly similar
novels, it is well written, well
organised and even contains a nearly
feasible storyline.
The plot itself is somewhat flimsy:
rich beautiful women meets rich,
beautiful stranger (male) and the
resulting relationship haunts the
remainder of the book. She takes over
the family publishing firm from her
incompetent brother w h o then
disappears off to a drying-out clinic.
Various characters find their way into
the story through the publishing
world, or the stranger's shady
dealings. The whole thing concludes
with a grand finale of the ultimate
crime brought about by the ultimate
abuse of power and the woman
realises what sort of man this stranger
really is: actually an incredibly,
unfulfilling and very predictable
conclusion.
for the interval a human gyroscope is
brought on stage, although I must
admit to wondering how the man has
going to stop spinning let alone get
out of the contraption which was
taking him round and round.
The second half is in a slightly
different vein, with song as well as
dance. The choreography seemed
much more traditional and this was
reflected in the confidence of the
dancers as they went through the
routines. Again there are some lovely
illusions, the music was more
flowing, and the tongue-in-cheek
humour which appeared in the first
half continues.
A l l in all it is a very enjoyable
evening with the experimentation in
choreography for the first half
contrasting the easiness of the second.
The ability of the principal dancers
helped sometimes to pull together the
coordination of the others who did not
always seem as confident. However
the quality of the dance is high and
throughout the performance you
constantly find yourself marvelling at
their combined elasticity and stength.
M.B.
Maureen Rissik herself has spent
her life working in a publishers and
it comes as no surprise to find details
and phrases that could only have been
concocted by someone ' i n the
business'. However, it is well
explained and leaves you feeling a
little more learned in the world of
publishing.
The book encapsulates many
problems, but the key message is
surely that it is possible to succeed as
a woman in a corrupt and ambitious
business (and world) consistently
dominated by men. M y feelings:
interesting and very much alive, but
not recommended to those who turn
to Tolstoy and Dickens for light
relief! Despite the very cool ending,
I enjoyed every minute of Relative
Strangers.
