RSM Open Day 1987
Thursday December 3rd 1987
Open day this year has been designed
on a more lavish and hopefully more
appealing scale. A more professional
and 'up market' approach is to be
adopted in the overall presentation.
The three departments of the
R S M — G e o l o g y , Materials and
Mineral Resources Engineering—will
be open for sixth form students,
accompanying school staff and invited
industrialists to tour undergraduate
teaching areas. Over 500 visitors are
expected to attend and will be guided
in small groups by undergraduate
students through displays of
undergraduate project work.
Admissions tutors, careers advisors,
and other academic staff will be
available to discuss the different
degree courses on offer and career
paths open to graduates.
A n integral part of the day will be
an exhibition supported by 30
organisations who are associated with
subject areas within the degree course
or who may be future employers. This
exhibition will be held within a large
heated marquee covering over 400
square metres of the concrete
walkway outside and adjacent to the
R S M and Electrical buildings.
Particular effort has been devoted to
give this aspect of a professional
atmosphere and w i l l be open
throughout the day to visitors and to
all students of Imperial College who
wish to confer with the organisations
present.
Visiting school staff and staff
manning the main exhibition will be
invited to a buffet lunch hosted by
members of the academic staff of the
three departments.
In addition to the main exhibition
area there will be two static exhibits
located in the roadway outside the
entrance to the Royal School of Mines
in Prince Consort Road. Volvo B M
(UK) will be providing a 30 tonne
Rock Shovel and Mineral Contract
Services will be providing a 25 tonne
Dump Truck. These exhibits will be
available throughout the day for
visitors to examine.
A l l students are invited. Be there!

INSEAD-Providing
'significant upward mobility'
I N S E A D is the largest and the most
international of the European
postgraduate business schools.
Twenty-seven years old it is situated
in Fontainebleau just outside of Paris.
Students come in two classes for the
one year M B A — 1 5 0 starting in
September and another 150 in
January. The U K and France each
provide about a quarter of the
students, with another 25% from
other European countries, 12% from
Canada and the United States, with
the remainder from the rest of the
world.
Entry is very competitive with an
acceptance rate of about 1:6. French
is an entry and German an exit
requirement although little teaching
is done in the former and none in the
latter. Work experience is virtually a
prerequisite with the average age
being around 28.
It is private and seems initially
expensive. The average IC student's
first year out salary would just cover
the fees. But unlike a lot of M B A
programmes, eg London Business
School, it is one year only. Banks are
willing too to finance students at very
low interest rates. Why? I N S E A D
graduates end up not only usually
with significant upward mobility in
career and change of direction if
wanted, but along with that a sharp
boost in salary.
Engineers make up about 30% of
the recruitment so IC grads would not
feel alone. They would even find a
few I C people t h e r e — A l a
Sawistowska, BSc 1978, won a
Cosmopolitan award to go to
Fontainebleau last year.
Because of the work experience
requirement, I N S E A D is not
immediately accessible to I C
undergrads. But it might be worth
hearing on site about something for
the future.
BUFFET BAR
BP EXPLORATION STAFF
will talk informally about
P E T R O L E U M E N G I N E E R I N G
and the openings in this field for
Engineering, Mathematics & Physics graduates
on
Wednesday 2nd December 1987 at 5.30 p.m.
in
THE ANTE ROOM, SHERFIELD BUILDING
'Petroleum Engineers are concerned with a wide range of oilfield operations, from
identifying and appraising new prospects to maximising the economic recovery of
oil (or gas) from producing fields. Their work can range from practical operating
methods to sophisticated software simulation.'
