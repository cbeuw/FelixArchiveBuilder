X-Wing Alliance (PC)
LucasArts
Our beloved games editor and I have this
running argument about which of the
Star Wars spacecraft makes the best
space fighter. Last time we discussed it,
he plumped for the B-wing on the
grounds that it was very tough, well
armoured although possibly a bit slow.
My preference is for either the A-wing or
(if I feel like playing on the side of the
Empire) the Tie Advanced, both because
they are fast and very manoeuvrable.
There has never been any debate about
the coolest ship in the Star Wars uni-
verse though; that honour has always
gone to the Millennium Falcon.
Now I know full well that many of
you keep back issues of felix in bound-
leather folders, and quite probably lov-
ingly laminate each new edition as soon
as It comes out, so I won't bore you with
tales of X-Wing Alliance's predecessors
which I (re)reviewed a couple of months
ago - look them up for yourselves. X-
Wing Alliance is the latest in the series,
and, as you'd expect from LucasArts, is
pretty damn impressive.
X-Wing Alliance starts shortly after
the destruction of the first Death Star and
the Hoth evacuation and runs to the bat-
tle of the second death star above the
planet of Yavin, roughly the same time-
frame as Tie Fighter, and follows the
career of the youngest son of a wealthy
trading family. This family gets involved
in a trade war with a second rich trading
family who, not being
afraid to play dirty when
necessary, conspire to have
the first rich trading fam-
ily's assets confiscated by
the Empire. At this point
the family are forced to go
into hiding and the son
goes off to join the rebel
cause.
Initially you get to fly a
couple of light freighter craft, both of
which are related to the Millennium Fal-
con, and the first few missions are very
much about learning how to use the
extra functions available in these craft.
They do very largely replace the training
missions in the original X-Wing and Tie
Fighter and, despite being wedged into
the storyline, do seem to fit in with what
comes later. Once you have flown a few
missions on the family's behalf, the sto-
ryline takes you to the Rebels and you
start flying for them.
In terms
of gameplay
there are no
h u g e
a d v a n c e s
from X-Wing
or Tie
fighter, but
the game
reeks paya-
bility. The
missions are
v a r i e d
enough for a
c e r t a i n
amount of
lateral thinking to be required at times -
the best policy is not always to blow
everything else up - and you certainly
don't feel as though you are getting into
a rut which is always a danger In games
of this kind.
There is a very strong
multiplayer element built
in to X-Wing Alliance
which is integrated
through the mission sim-
ulator, and allows you to
more or less build your
own missions. Should you
want to you can create a
mission to assault a Super
Star Destroyer with a fleet of escape
pods (Tip Of The Day-you'll fail). If you
don't feel that's hard enough, how about
setting it in an asteroid field? Or a mine-
field?
There is a huge range of ships that
you can build into your missions, from
static bases (and, peculiarly, a casino) to
the large capital ships, smaller escorts,
the ubiquitous fighters, various freighters
and transports and the already men-
tioned escape pods. The types of space-
ships available have been increased
exponentially, and now include all the
ships from
the films
and the
p r e v i o u s
g a m e s ,
most of
those from
the accom-
p a n y i n g
books, and
s o m e
w h i c h
seem to
have been
c o n j u r e d
up specifi-
cally for Alliance. It's tempting to think
that some of these new craft will be
making an appearance in The Phantom
Menace, but I guess we'll have to wait
and see. You can fly most of the fight-
ers, all of which have been given differ-
ent cockpit interiors, and they have dif-
ferent flight characteristics that need to
be taken into account in your tactics.
Apparently this game has been in
production for at least three years, and
a large part of that time has gone
towards a new graphics engine. This
shows - the graphics are simply superb,
especially on a fast PC with a 3D card. The
game will run in the earlier missions
using software rendering only, providing
you have a bit more RAM in your box, but
once you Join the rebellion, things will
slow down without a bit of hardware
acceleration - there are too many ships
flying around. LucasArts have appar-
ently claimed that you can have in the
region of 120 ships fighting it out at
once - the most I've tried it on is about
50 (plus mines), and it's almost
unplayable then, not due to graphics
slowdown: more because it's very hard
to tell who you should be shooting and
who you shouldn't.
It's a very hard game to criticise -
fucasArts have been at the forefront of
space combat simulations since they
released X-Wing all those years ago, and
it shows. The lessons from X-Wing Vs Tie
Fighter have been learnt, and learnt very
well, and what we now have is a game
that is perfectly balanced between single
and multiplayer elements. To sum up -
new Star Wars flight sim, state of the art,
lots and lots of fun.

Commandos - Beyond the Call of Duty and Warzone 2100 for the PC for free
Do you like your war close up and personal or do you prefer a bit of distance between
the guts and the guns. Well Eidos have managed to produce two excellent games,
Warzone 2100 and Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty that cover both the air-
chair General and the armchair Lieutenant out there.
Eidos have also supplied us with a copy each of these games, and you can be
one of the lucky, lucky people to pick up a free copy. Just send the answer the fol-
lowing question either to fellx@lc.ac.uk or pop the answer Into the office on a piece
of paper. The first two people out of the hat will win.
The question is:
Which two films about blowing things up have Navarone In their title.
(Hint Allstalr Maclean has a writing credit on both)
