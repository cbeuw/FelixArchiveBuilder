Paul Van Dyk Special Feature
PAUL V A N DYK is currently o n e o f t h e
biggest n a m e s In Djing in t h e world, a n d
has started 1999 with his biggest hit yet
- his n e w remix o f Humate's 'Love Stim-
ulation', w h i c h entered t h e U K singles
charts at 18 a n d stayed there for four
weeks.
This is only the start o f what promises
to b e a great year for Paul, w h o is work-
ing o n his n e w a l b u m , 'Avenue O f Stars',
set for release o n Deviant later in '99. It's
a year that could hardly have g o n e w r o n g
after he kicked it off with a live N e w
Year's Eve/Day triple-header, playing to
packed clubs in M i l t o n Keynes, Stoke
and Sheffield b e t w e e n m i d n i d g h t a n d
6am, a n d still getting h o m e in time for
lunch.
'Avenue O f Stars' will follow-up to
his remix c o l l e c t i o n , ' V o r s p r u n g D y k
Technik', his acclaimed triple-CD remix
collection. That c a m e in t h e w a k e o f his
first Top 40 hit, T o r A n A n g e l '98', w h i c h
entered t h e national charts in A u g u s t at
n u m b e r 28 a n d spent four w e e k s in t h e
top 75 a n d t w o w e e k s at n u m b e r o n e
in the d a n c e chart.
In a hectic 1998, d u r i n g w h i c h 'for
An Angel' not only hit t h e charts but also
appeared o n a mind-boggling variety o f
TV and radio s h o w s - f r o m t h e fairly-pre-
dictable M T V to t h e less-predictable
Grandstand, Paul also e n j o y e d t e n t o p
40 hits as a remixer.
He w a s v o t e d 6th best DJ in DJ
m a g a z i n e ' s authoritative end-of-year
chart. H e w o n Bassline m a g a z i n e ' s Best
International DJ award. H e w a s v o t e d
Best International DJ in N o r t h e r n Ire-
land's B B M m a g a z i n e . H e w a s n o m i -
nated for Best International DJ in t h e
1998 M u z i k awards and, a m o n g his m a n y
Djing road rips, he established a resi-
dency at N e w York's Twilo Club (Sasha,
D i g w e e d a n d Carl Cox are t h e other 'res-
idents').
'Avenue O f Stars' will constitute t h e
follow-up to his acclaimed 1997 a l b u m
'Seven Ways', w h i c h s p a w n e d three sin-
gles in 1997, 'Beautiful Place', ' f o r b i d -
den fruit' a n d 'Words'.
So w h e r e did all this start? Well, in
Eisenhuttenstadt in t h e o l d East Ger-
many: a state w h e r e t h e premier Erich
Honecker reacted to t h e Soviet policy o f
glasnost with t h e retort, "If your n e i g h -
bour r e d e c o r a t e d his flat, w o u l d y o u
redecorate yours?", a n d f r e e d o m o f
m o v e m e n t a n d creative activity w e r e
destinies less likely than a lifelong career
in aTrabant factory, labouring under the
impression that Western music s t o p p e d
with T h e Beatles a n d Elton John.
Paul van Dyk - favourite group, N e w
Order - spent his last f e w years in this
d y i n g outpost o f state-control socialism
d e v e l o p i n g , but u n a b l e to f e e d prop-
erly, a g r o w i n g appetite for house music,
w h i c h h e first heard o n western radio In
1985. H e taught himself to mix o n "two
fucked-up o l d turntables a n d a very o l d
mixer". However, like those o f m a n y o f
his compatriots, his ambitions s e e m e d
unlikely to b e fulfilled.
Paul V a n Dyk In crap c a m e r a pose.
But s e i s m i c political a n d social
upheavals t h r o u g h o u t eastern Europe
led to t h e fall in 1989 o f t h e Berlin Wall
a n d , as East a n d West G e r m a n y h e a d e d
t o w a r d s r e u n i f i c a t i o n , far-reaching
reforms in t h e East permitted adventur-
o u s souls to up anchor a n d set off for
whatever a n d wherever they fancied - in
Paul's case, t h e organically e x p a n d i n g
a n d o c c a s i o n a l l y e x p l o d i n g rave/club
s c e n e in Berlin, w h e r e h e arrived a r m e d
only with his primitive mix tapes a n d
started Djing in M a r c h 1991.
The Berlin s c e n e w a s m o v i n g at a
hectic pace but Paul van Dyk w a s mov-
ing e v e n faster a n d it t o o k little time for
his u n i q u e blend o f uplifting trance a n d
progressive h o u s e to establish h i m as
o n e o f t h e leading DJs o n the reborn
city's vibrant club scene. H e b e c a m e res-
ident at D u b m i s s i o n at E-Werk, hottest
spot in a non-stop musical heatwave.
A n d , s o o n e r or later, just driving t h e
decks w o u l d not be sufficient outlet for
his talent.
The m e n to realise this first w e r e
M a r k Reeder (ex-pat M a n c u n i a n ) a n d
Torsten Jurk (East G e r m a n cohort) - both
refugees f r o m t h e D D R w h o w e r e busy
recording the n e w music o f Berlin a n d its
environs o n their M F S label. They encour-
a g e d Paul to take t h e step into t h e stu-
dio a n d the first result w a s t h e Visions O f
Shiva project, c o o k e d up with keyboard
maestro C o s m i c Baby, a n d c o m i n g up
with t w o a c c l a i m e d singles, 'Perfect
Day'(1992) a n d ' H o w M u c h C a n Y o u
Take?' (1993).
Visions faded, but Paul w e n t o n to
b e c o m e an M f S artist in his o w n right,
d e b u t i n g with 1994's 'Green Valley' EP
a n d following through with t h e '45 R P M '
a l b u m later that year. D e m a n d also g r e w
for his talents as a remixer. f r o m '93
onwards, he could b e f o u n d sprinkling
the fairy dust o n tracks by artists as
obscure as M F S labelmates H u m a t e a n d
DFM, as unlikely as Madchester survivors
Inspiral Carpets (another o f t h e y o u n g
FVD's favourite listens in D D R days) a n d
as b i g as N e w Order, Tori A m o s a n d
Dina Carroll - fabulous remixes that c a n
be f o u n d o n 'Vorsprung Dyk Technik'.
A n d all the while he built his international
reputation as a brilliant a n d innovative
live DJ, both in Europe a n d t h e States.
Paul v a n Dyk's s o u l f u l m u s i c is
i n f o r m e d as m u c h by t h e raw m e l a n -
c h o l y o f t h e N e w O r d e r a n d Smiths
records h e listened to w h i l e h o l e d u p in
Eisenhuttenstadt as by t h e h o u s e a n d
t e c h n o that led h i m u p t h e road to Berlin
a n d b e y o n d . His prescient records are
i n f o r m e d by the k n o w l e d g e that elec-
tronic music must convey e m o t i o n if it is
to swerve anonymity a n d earn t h e love
of a broad public rather than t h e casual
attention o f a one-night stand club
crowd.
His Deviant releases w h i c h , since
the 'Seven Ways' a l b u m , have paralleled
t h o s e o n MFS, represent t h e f o u n d a -
tions o f a b o d y o f w o r k w h i c h will l o n g
outlive e v e n t h e c r e a m o f a n y year's
f a s h i o n a b l e d a n c e g e n r e . L o n g unar-
guably t h e top DJ in Germany, he has not
b e e n b o u n d by t h e G e r m a n s c e n e -
rather, he's b e c o m e a w o r l d w i d e ambas-
sador for it a n d a personal e m b o d i m e n t
of its qualities. H e maintains a h o m e
base in Berlin, but w h e r e v e r y o u are, h e
will b e with y o u s o o n .
