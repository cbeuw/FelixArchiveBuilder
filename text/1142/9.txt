V
asily Kandinsky (1866 - 1944)
undoubtedly exerted a p r o f o u n d
influence o n modern art. Surprisingly
enough, this pioneer of the abstract style
was something of a mature prodigy. He
abandoned an auspicious career in law at
the age of 29, inspired by the revelation of
a Haystack by Monet, which "impressed
itself ineradicably u p o n [his] m e m o r y ,
always hovering before [his] eyes". Besides
being gifted with a photographic m e m -
ory, Kandinsky was synaesthesic - distinct
shades o f colours stimulated powerful
sounds and sensations in his brain.
The substantial collection
of prints, sketches, water-
colours and gouaches provides
a comprehensive overview of
Kandinsky's innovative artistic
evolution throughout the 20th
century. Initially influenced by Russian fairy-
tales and religious icons, the subject mat-
ter gradually evolved towards intrinsically
geometric, non-figurative compositions.
Although folkloric motifs of his homeland
subsequently emerge In his work such as
The Great Gate of Kiev (pictured right),
Kandinsky is renowned for his vivid, non-
objective pieces - Off Balance for instance,
pictured left. Kandinsky also developed and
applied a scientific, theoretical basis to his
technique, which revolutionised the Expres-
sionist movement. Disillusioned by the polit-
ical turbulence in communist Russia, he
emigrated to Germany where he lectured
at the Bauhaus institute and was involved
in the compilation of The Blue Rider (Der
Blaue Reiter) almanac.
The most fascinating element of the
exhibition w a s the inclusion of a video,
s h o w i n g the artist at work. Within a matter
of minutes, a blank page was covered in
dynamic swirls and grids, revealing his spon-
taneous and swiff approach to art. His paint-
ings literally c a m e to life.

Verdi Requiem

Friday 19 M a r c h , I n o t e d that there
were almost as m a n y places for t h e
performers as for t h e a u d i e n c e . This w a s
encouraging because Verdi's Requiem is
a big work requiring w h a t might be col-
loquially t e r m e d 'large portions'. A Ger-
man c o n d u c t o r o f t h e d a y d u b b e d it
Verdi's 'latest o p e r a dressed in ecclesi-
astical robes' for its dramatic a n d s e c u -
lar style. It evokes a series o f contrasting
emotions, s o m e t i m e s powerfully, s o m e -
times with the utmost delicacy. It is a
string o f fixating, breathtaking passages
