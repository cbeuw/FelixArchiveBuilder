EMINEM
The Slim Shady LP [
'HI, I d o n ' t believe w e ' v e b e e n Intro-
d u c e d b e f o r e - m y n a m e Is...'
F
irst o f all, let's get o n e t h i n g
straight. W h e n this a l b u m says
'explicit' it m e a n s it. If y o u don't
w a n t your cars polluted with tales o f
m u r d e r , rape, m u l t i p l e s u i c i d e
a t t e m p t s , theft, u n d e r a g e s e x a n d
drugs don't get this a l b u m . If, o n the
other h a n d , all this stuff s o u n d s b a n g
up your street this is a p r i m e e x a m p l e o f
the genre.
Slim S h a d y is t h e n e w n a m e o f
t m i n e m , Dr Dre's (of N W A a n d Fuck t h a
Police f a m e ) latest student. W i l h this
kind o f backing, it's pretty definite that
this a l b u m will get lots o f attention - but
can E m i n e m k e e p this attention with a
prime slice of raw rap with a funny edge?
Yep. Looks like this is g o i n g to b e
o n e o f t h e largest rap a l b u m s o f t h e
year. I think t h e secret to this a l b u m ' s
attraction is t h e fact that every track is a
little story ail in itself. Brain Damage
relates to L-minem's r e v e n g e o n his for-
mer high s c h o o l bullies. '97 Bonnie &
Clyde is a very m e s s e d u p little tale o f
E m i n e m m u r d e r i n g his ex-wife, ex-wife's
n e w h u s b a n d a n d son. After c o m m i t t i n g
this terrible crime he proceeds to take his
daughter back a n d drive to the b e a c h to
d u m p the b o d i e s o f his victims. I k n o w
this s o u n d s a little sick but this s o n g is
really all a b o u t his daughter a n d h o w
m u c h he loves her, a really sweet ballad
w h i c h gets a little sick.
If I Had talks a b o u t all E m i n e m ' s
w o e s with t h e w o r l d , h e says he is 'tired
of b e i n g w h i t e trash', 'tired o f having a
lack of funds a n d resorting back to guns'
a n d ' w e a r i n g t h e s a m e d a m n Nike Air
hat'. H e also says that 'If I h a d o n e wish,
I w o u l d a s k for a b i g e n o u g h ass for t h e
w h o l e w o r l d to kiss.' As well as talking
about what he sees o n the street, he also
maintains a c o m e d y e d g e that s o m e h o w
m a k e s it all t h e m o r e poignant.
Just b e f o r e it all gets t o o serious he
w h i p s it back in with his ' d a n c e ' s o n g ,
Cmon everybody. A t u n e in t h e fine tra-
dition o f Will Smith - this w o u l d be a sure
fire hit if he ever gets a r o u n d to releas-
ing it, a n d cutting al! t h e swear w o r d s
out. W h i c h w o u l d probably ruin it - but
ain't that just t h e w a y o f m a k i n g it palat-
able to mainstream America's generation
X'ers.
A great a l b u m , full o f f u n n y as hell
lyrics a n d large beats to g o with it thanks
to Dr. Dre. Get it before h e gets t o o
c o m m e r c i a l a n d forgets w h e r e he c a m e
from. A n d forgets h o w to swear so Imag-
inatively. H

MATTHEW MARSDEN
Say Who |
Matt, mate, do us a favour -
give up your day job.
T
hrow-away-pop w o u l d b e a
harsh y e t a c c u r a t e w a y o f
describing t h e 12 sloppy tracks
o n this a l b u m . With his boyish c h a r m
and s u p p o s e d l y a m a z i n g g o o d looks,
M r M a r s d e n has b e e n m a n u f a c t u r e d to
m a k e t h e heart of any y o u n g t e e n a g e
girl miss a beat. Here arises a p r o b l e m
in that I a m neither 15, nor d o I read
Smash hits or JI 7. Despite this, I'm pret-
ty sure that if I w a s or did, I w o u l d still
hate this a l b u m .
M a t t h e w M a r s d e n is yet a n o t h e r
attempt by record c o m p a n i e s to create
a perfect little package o f 'sex-appeal
that can sing'. H e s o u n d s very similar to
Gary Barlow but that's w h e r e t h e simi-
larity ends. At least Gary Barlow h a d a bit
or originality about h i m in his style o f
music. O n e o f M a r s d e n ' s w h i n y love
s o n g s is just about bearable. But twelve
of t h e m , back to back, are e n o u g h to
make y o u want to g o a n d throw yourself
out of t h e nearest w i n d o w s c r e a m i n g
' N o M o r e l ' Yes, believe m c , it is truly that
bad. It isn't really M a t t h e w ' s fault that h e
is rubbish, t h o u g h . Afterall, h e didn't
write the awful s o n g s that h e sings. H e
co-wrote 4 of the 12 tracks (including m y
particular favourite Say Who) but y o u
w o u l d n ' t have noticed - they are just as
b o r i n g a n d naff as all the rest. There are
t w o s i n g l e s o n this a l b u m that have
already b e e n released. If y o u k n o w The
Heart's Lone Desire a n d S h e ' s Cone,
t h e n y o u k n o w t h e type of t h i n g w e ' r e
into here.
O n a m o r e positive note, t h e a l b u m
is well p r o d u c e d with t h e first f e w sec-
o n d s o f e a c h s o n g s o u n d i n g pretty
interesting. It's just t h e r e m a i n i n g 2 or 3
minutes that spiral d o w n toward n e w lev-
els o f crap-ness never quite r e a c h e d
before/That sinking feeling usually starts
at the s a m e point that M a t t h e w starts
singing. It is not as t h o u g h his voice is
bad, it is just that it is so ' n o r m a l ' . T h e ,
only possible u s e for this a l b u m , that I
can think of, w o u l d b e as b a c k g r o u n d
music w h e n y o u are working. It is unique
to m e in b e i n g t h e only C D that c a n b e
listened t o a n d n o t c a u s e distraction
f r o m t h e task at h a n d . But, unless y o u
are t h e type o f p e r s o n that g o e s into a
m u s i c s h o p l o o k i n g for s o m e t h i n g that
it so b o r i n g your s u b c o n s c i o u s will block
it out, I w o u l d n ' t b u y this. CI
