Millennium Fever
The last day of the spring term culmi-
nated in the usual fiesta that is the Car-
nival. Although millennium fever failed to
build up in respect to ticket sales c o m -
pared to other carnivals, this w a s m o r e
than adequately c o m p e n s a t e d for by a
more mature a n d appreciative c r o w d .
The n u m e r o u s h o u s e a n d garage
fans at IC had their m o m e n t w h e n Sher-
field's o w n security stalwarts otherwise
known as Chilliblank mixed the tunes. The
r o o m was culturally inspired by Arthur C
Clarke's epic, 2001 A Space Odyssey,
while as usual the chill-out r o o m was
well refreshed by its selection of enticing
cocktails.
O n e of the major focal points at the
event w a s the p o p u l a r b o u n c y
LaserQuest. So keen w e r e s o m e of the
combatants that a g u n was stolen by o n e
miscreant. dB's was bathed in music from
the ubiquitous Shaft. The live music was
provided courtesy of the Sugarplums w h o
s e e m e d to be m o r e at h o m e with indie
rather than funk. The people in the m o s h
pit, w h o w e r e certainly roused by m a n y
an anthem, confirmed this.
Congratulations go to M a r k H o m e
and his Ents t e a m for their d e d i c a t e d
and often unheralded efforts for another
satisfactory night.

In brief...

dents look set to gain Chartered Engineer
status w h e n they graduate, provided that
they d o e n o u g h c o m p u t i n g . The Insti-
tute o f C h a r t e r e d Engineers recently
reviewed the Department of C o m p u t -
ing's undergraduat e courses, a c c o r d i n g
to their n e w regulations. The 12 m o n t h
M S c course in A d v a n c e d C o m p u t i n g has
also b e e n accredited; Director of Studies
Margaret C u n n i n g h a m believes that this
is the first course of its kind to be recog-

According to research carried out by

principle effect o f recent increases

1990, 1995 a n d 1997 w e r e the
warmest years for over 500 years,
