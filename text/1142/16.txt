I is the s e q u e l t o last year's stalk a n d
I slash flick o f almost t h e s a m e n a m e ,
then it's a fair bet that y o u have s o m e
idea o f w h a t t o expect f r o m / Still Know

thinking a l o n g t h e lines o f a w h o l e -
s o m e l y attractive f e m a l e c o l l e g e stu-

blokes - generally m o u t h y , nerdy or
intermittently sinister - d e s p e r a t e l y

not far from the mark.

After all, it Is w h e r e most a x e m u r -

the stormy s e a s o n a n d the place is all
but d e s e r t e d , a n d Love Hewitt a n d c o
find t h e m s e l v e s in that other stalwart
scary film location, t h e isolated hotel.

diversions w h i l e y o u attempt to d e c i d e
w h o is a significant character a n d w h o
is m e r e l y p r e s e n t in a h o o k f o d d e r
capacity.
The British director, D a n n y C a n n o n ,
h a n d l e s t h e m i s d i r e c t i o n b e l o v e d o f
this g e n r e c o m p e t e n t l y , a n d w h e n t h e
h o m i c i d a l f i s h e r m a n finally arrives o n
the s c e n e t h e e x p e c t e d escalating ten-
sion is delivered. In fact, it's not even dif-
f u s e d by t h e f i s h e r m a n ' s m o r e comical
then sinister c h o i c e o f slasher get-up.
I s u p p o s e a s o u ' wester a n d rain-
coat are g o o d for k e e p i n g t h e b l o o d off
your clothes, but they're not as fright-
e n i n g as a ski mask. With a plot as flimsy
as t h e singlets w h i c h stricken heroines
have universally settled u p o n as this
s e a s o n ' s d e rigeur outfit for r u n n i n g
a w a y f r o m a loony, this film offers very
little b e y o n d t h e standard s h o c k tactics
o f a h u n d r e d o t h e r m o v i e s . It is
u n d o u b t e d l y p o l i s h e d , but, lacking t h e
h u m o u r o f Scream say, it is pretty unin-
s p i r e d . Plenty o f s h o c k s , but n o sur-
prises. D

An Ideal Husband * * •
Starring : Rupert Everett, Minnie Driver, Cate Blanchett, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Northam, Julianne Moore
Director: Oliver Parker
T
he first o f this year's b i g s c r e e n
version's o f O s c a r W i l d e ' s classic
play is a fairly straight-forward
adaptation o f his turn-of-the-century
tale o f gentle political intrigue a n d
r o m a n c e , b r o u g h t t o life b y a lavish
Anglo-American c o - p r o d u c t i o n .
Whilst t h e story is surprisingly rele-
vant t o d a y - p r e a c h i n g t o l e r a n c e
towards o u r ever-infallible f e l l o w m a n
(be they politicans or loved-ones) - t h e
real w i n n e r is t h e script. W i l d e ' s char-
acters c o m e alive v i a his t r a d e m a r k wit-
ticisms a n d great battle-of-the-sexes
banter. M o r e o v e r , d e s p i t e t h e fact that
most o f t h e plot is u n b e l i e v a b l y o b v i -
ous, it s o m e h o w m a n a g e s to carry y o u
a l o n g w i t h o u t ever caring that it's s o
utterly predictable.
The other b i g plus point is Rupert
Everett, perfectly cast as d a p p e r m a n -
about-town Lord Arthur G o r i n g , w h o s e
flippant, caddish exterior naturally hides
the hero w h o will ultimately get t h e
girl a n d save t h e day. J u l i a n n c M o o r e
Wilde was clearly a big fan of gritty, sllce-of-life realism.
a d m i r a b l y d e m o n s t r a t e s that s h e t o o are t h e real let-down, with Driver a n d
k n o w s h o w to b a l a n c e a delightfully N o r t a m in particular d e l i v e r i n g their
over-the-top role, playing t h e villain o f lines in a very stilted fashion, clearly not
the piece, t h e d e v i o u s M r s Cheevely. at h o m e with t h e style o f W i l d e ' s dia-
It's t h e rest o f t h e cast, h o w e v e r , w h o l o g u e .
O n e o f t h e p r o b l e m s inherant in
a d a p t i n g e i g h t e e n t h a n d n i n e t e e n t h
c e n t u r y plays is that, by-and-large,
they're incredibly studio set, generally
revolving a r o u n d d r a w i n g - r o o m antics.
An Ideal Husband is n o e x c e p t i o n , a n d
in a t t e m p t i n g t o o p e n o u t t h e script,
director Parker w a l k s a very fine line
b e t w e e n 9 0 ' s over-stylisation a n d
W i l d e ' s lightness o f t o u c h . Sadly, it's a
line h e crosses m o r e t h a n o n c e , a n d
consequently t h e all-important dialogue
is occasionally s w a m p e d in faux-period
a t m o s p h e r e . N o n e t h e l e s s , h e d o e s a
v e r y g o o d j o b o f m a k i n g t h e story
a c c e s s i b l e t o a nineties a u d i e n c e .
In e s s e n c e , whilst it's u n d o u b t e d l y
f l a w e d , this is n o n e t h e l e s s a carefully
c o n s t r u c t e d , l o v i n g recreation, b o u y e d
u p by Everett's s u p e r b p e r f o r m a n c e .
Ultimately, h o w e v e r , your take o n it
will d e p e n d entirely o n w h e t h e r y o u
find Wilde's w o r d s sparklingly brilliant or
simply irritatingly clever-clever... Q
