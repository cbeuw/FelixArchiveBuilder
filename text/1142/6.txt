I always feel the tiniest bit guilty
about m a k i n g such hard w o r k of g o i n g
shopping. I m e a n it's only
just d o w n the road, a fif-
teen minute walk at the
very most. It's not like I
have to trek for hours,
barefoot under the m i d -
day sun clad only in a loincloth, s u c k i n g
groundwater up through h o l l o w reeds in
order not to die of thirst, f o l l o w i n g the
almost imperceptibly faint tracks o f my
prey w h i c h I will have to bring d o w n
using a David-and-Goliath-typc stone in
a sling. Nor d o I have to h e a d off for a
three day trip into d e n s e subtropical rain-
forest a r m e d w i t h a
spear a n d a catapult,
searching for a r m a d i l -
los or s o m e t h i n g
equally scaly a n d u n a p -
petising to knock sense-
less a n d turn into a
casserole. C o m p a r e d
to the lengths to w h i c h
s o m e p e o p l e have t o
go to in order to fulfil
their most basic dietary requirements,
my life is simplicity itself. O n the other
hand, Kalahari B u s h m e n rarely have t o
contend with a n irate p e n s i o n e r w h o ,
having taken ticket n u m b e r 47 at t h e
deli counter, w a n d e r e d off to get a bot-
tle of C a m p coffee a n d then returned fif-
teen minutes later, to find that the ' N o w
Serving' number has m o v e d o n to 62 a n d
he has lost his place in the q u e u e . Like-
wise I'm willing to bet that instances of
A m a z o n i a n Indians getting stressed out
because the only trolley left is the o n e
with the w h e e l brake stuck o n are very
rare i n d e e d .
This b e i n g said, I a m still of the o p i n -
ion that all in all I've probably got the bet-
ter deal. O n e t h i n g f o r sure.

pasta sauce " m a d e to a 300-year old tra-
ditional recipe". I have never b e e n able
to understand w h y age should be a guar-
a n t e e of quality, as implied by the label
on the jar w h i c h I had just placed into my
trolley. I have often w o n d e r e d w h e t h e r

thick-stand-your-spoon-up-in-it yoghurt -
the culinary e q u i v a l e n t o f Russian
Roulette a n d o n e that c o m e s with a
'noticeable h a r d e n i n g of arteries or your

meat counter s h o w e d that the inflation-
ary e x p a n s i o n h a d b e e n e x t e n d e d to
this part of the store as well. Now, as well
as chicken a n d pork o n e could purchase
ostrich, alligator a n d kangaroo. I toyed
with the i d e a o f b u y i n g s o m e venison
but it was a bit deer. The bread counter
saw m e getting my hands on a crusty cob
a n d a packet o f American-style donuts

had an extra 25 Advantage

the temptation of the 3 for 2
Castrol GTX offer. I h a d
p u r c h a s e d so m a n y things
that I couldn't m a k e use o f the "eight
items or grammatically incorrect" Express
C h e c k o u t a n d I was forced to wait while
the c u s t o m e r in front, w h o s e s h o p p i n g
s e e m e d to consist entirely of items either
having n o price or a n unreadable bar-
code, slowly p a c k e d his things away in
a b o u t s e v e n t e e n sepa-
rate bags a n d paid with
the takings of his Penny
Arcade, before I could
have the cost o f all my
n e w possessions totted
u p . T h e r e t h e n fol-

of p a y i n g for the stuff,
w h e r e b y t h e cashier
d o e s their level best to
shove the contents o f my s h o p p i n g trol-
ley d o w n the conveyor belt a n d into the
h o l d i n g area at the e n d faster than I can
stuff t h e m into the ludicrously flimsy,
pre-ripped p o l y t h e n e bags provided, in
s o m e grim a n d manic imitation of that bit
with the cuddly toy at the e n d of the Gen-
eration G a m e . I left the s h o p , sweating
profusely a n d with the vein in my t e m -
ple pulsating uncontrollably.
There's no disguising it -1 hate d o i n g
the weekly s h o p . But at least it's over for
another seven days. With a full larder my
f o o d life will b e m u c h i m p r o v e d , for a
while at least. It's quite a comforting feel-
ing, only... o h d a m n I forgot to buy toi-
let rolls. A n d Brillo pads, a n d coffee...
and, ...oh for g o o d n e s s sake...
