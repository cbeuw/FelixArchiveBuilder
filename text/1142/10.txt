SWALLOW @ CLUB INNOCENCE
Swallow @ Club Innocence
Shand St., London Bridge
£8 NUS/£10
10pm-6am
Swallow. A club run by a group of
young people for young people. Having
recieved high accolades in both Timeout
and The Independent, I figured it was
time I went down and had checked the
club out myself- in the interests of jour-
nalism of course.
Swallow hasn't been running for
long, and you could see that this was a
night in it's infancy but with huge poten-
tial. You walk into the club and can feel
the rawness of a night that will soon be
massive. The music policy is simple - no
cheese. A whole host of DJs play hard-
house, techno, and hardcore until the
small hours of the morning. And we're
not just talking any old DJs, but jocks such
as Darren Pearce and Nicky Blackmarket.
Since Swallow has been changing venue
(due to costs), tonight saw the night at
Club Innoncence down by fondon
Bridge. There were two rooms, a chill out
area and a connecting room where you
could eat all the sweets you wanted.
The atmosphere was great, though
the crowd was a bit young for my liking
(but then I'm a fussy bastard). The decor
included drapes all over the place and
the lighting created a very dark and
haunting dancefloor. After midnight you
could see why Swallow will be massive -
lots of people, the beer was flowing
freely, there were plenty of DJs and
there was still six hours to go.
One of the great things about Swal-
low is its music policy and the large num-
ber of DJs playing. Each DJ plays for a
couple of hours or so and then there's
a change as a new jock plays his kind of
tunes in his own style. This stops you get-
ting bored and creates an atmosphere
filled with anticipation.
The venue was alright, and as in
London anywhere is better than
nowhere....so the club was run in some
railway arches that had been converted.
Not too bad, but I've been to better.
I'll take this opportunity to thank
Chris and the Swallow gang for letting us
come down and check out what is sure
to be one of fondon's premier nights.
There will be more Swallow nights
throughout this term and Clubscene will
let you know all the details as we get
them. The next one should be at Mass
in Brixton.

Singles
Single of the Week
Chubby Chunks
'I'm Tellln You'
(Cleveland City)
fantastic single on the Cleveland
City label. Originally this was the first
release on the label and was the 'Star-
dust' of it's time. The 1999 version fea-
tures the great vocals of Kim Ruffin.
There are two different mixes on the 12"
from the Prophets of Sound and Domi-
natrix. The Dominatrix mix is an excellent
progressive track with deep beats and
bass, whilst the Prophets' mix is a more
funkier, house version.
Charles Schillings
'No Communication'
A superb track from premier f rench
DJ Charles Schillings (resident at Discobar
@ Rex Club, Paris). This comes as a dou-
ble vinyl pack and includes a deep vocal
cut just oozing with Parisian soul. Salt
City Orchestra provide a soulful electro-
influenced rework. There is a funked-up
version using rolling electric bass and
funky organs whilst the final two mixes
provide a harder interpretation with
plenty of pianos and a pumping style ver-
sion. Out in May this is French house at
its very best.

Demon
'Lil' Fuck'
(20000ST)
Fantastic single following on from
Demon's excellent 'Regulate' track. This
EP brings together three mixes of the ace
titled track, one from Etienne De Crecy
and one from ECube. De Crecy pro-
vides a very vocal, deep and funky remix
whilst ECube provides a deeper version.
The other track on the EP 'My City' pro-
vides a seriously rolling groove, mixing
bongo with funky beats. Something for
anytime of the day or night. Out on the
4th May.

Jlml Tenor
Total Devastation'
(Warp)
More funky gooves from the Finn on
Warp records. This is pumping old skool
electro of the highest quality. Produced
by Jimi himself, the 12" boasts three
excellent mixes, whislt the CD version
gives three very different interpretations.
With lots of chilled out funky beats and
great vocals each remix stays closely with
the original track whilst giving its own
interpretation.
Beat-Boy
The Roof Is On Fire'
(Fresh)
Fucking awful single on the Fresh label.
This debut single from a new group Is
simply shit. There are plenty of remixes
which (surprise, surprise) all sound
exactly the same. Cheesy and irritating
vocals - some of the worst I have ever
heard - are passed off as 'hip hop, dance
and 60's psychedelia with a fresh 90's
lick'. Quite frankly the single is a load of
bollocks (something rare from Fresh)
and you get the impression that the pro-
ducers and group haven't put in any
effort at all. Out on the 10th May - and
will no doubt be a hit with the teenagers
of Britain. Cheese!!

Carl Cox
'Phuture 2000'
(Edel)
Top single from a top jock, Phuture
2000 is the first single to be released from
Carl's long awaited new album of the
same name. With great pumping break-
beats on a spirtiual sound and deep
vocals, this is a single being canned on
Radio 1, with the 'Hybrid' mix being the
best of the three mixes. Out now.

Delirium
'Silence'
(Pinnacle)
This excellent, deep spirtiual, pro-
gressive tune will finally get a release in
the UK. 'Silence'is one hell of a track. It
features haunting vocals from folk-pop
star Sarah McLachlan and has been ham-
mered by Sasha and Digweed - it has also
featured on their recent Northen Expo-
sure 3 album. The Sanctuary mix is a
gem - subtle and soulful. Progressive
music can't get better. Out on Pinnacle
on the 10th May.
