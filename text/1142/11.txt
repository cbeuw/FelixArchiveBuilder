The p e o p l e at Renaissance deliver

ume of a n e w series. A d o u b l e C D with
well over two hours of music, this a l b u m
features the m i x i n g talents o f t w o great
DJs, A n t h o n y Pappa a n d Rennie Pilgrem.
Disc 1 (recorded live In Australia) is the
deep, spiritual progressive s o u n d that
Renaissance is legendary for. Starting
with the w o n d e r f u l o p e n i n g t u n e 'Water
Ride' by 16B, the music slowly builds u p
to m o r e progressive t u n e s with d e e p
beats. Tracks include H u m a t e ' s 'Love
Stimulation' a n d Hybrid's 'Kill City'. The
s e c o n d C D is a m o r e f u n k i e r s o u n d
mixed by Pilgrem a n d e n c o m p a s s e s funk
and breakbeat tunes - s o m e of t h e m
fast f l o w i n g whilst others are chilled.
This is an excellent compilation, but then
you'd e x p e c t that f r o m R e n a i s s a n c e .

Bang Bang
'JeTAImeJeTAIme'
(East West Records)
It's b e e n out for a little while n o w but
this is a superb f r e n c h h o u s e a l b u m .
The brainchild of Xavier J a m a u x , the
album is funky, soulful, h o u s e a n d folk
all rolled into o n e . Xavier builds t h e
foundation for his trcaks with his vast
array of vintage keyboards a n d a d d s his
o w n drums, bass a n d samples. Inspired
by the music of the 70's, he alsofuses
together folk and soul. A d d to this s o m e
w o n d e r f u l vocals, a n d the result is a top
a l b u m , w h i c h y o u will e n d up listening
to time a n d time again. H o w d o the
French d o it?

' O a k e n f o l d @ C r e a m '
(Virgin)
O a k e n f o l d has left C r e a m , a n d so
the s c o u s e superclub have j u m p e d o n
the b a n d w a g o n to s q u e e z e more m o n e y
out of the clubbers w h o w o r s h i p the
planet's finest DJ. This is a d o u b l e CD
a l b u m a n d is a live recording of Oaken-
fold at C r e a m playing the kind of tracks
which have m a d e him the top jock in the
world. There are nearly thirty tracks over
t w o CDs a n d I g u e s s if y o u like Cream/
O a k i e then it's worht c h e c k i n g out, but
this a l b u m is really a case of C r e a m milk-
ing as m u c h as they can a n d it's n o t h i n g
special. The booklet y o u get with the C D
is a m a z i n g - probably the worst booklet
I have ever seen and full of crappy facts
such as the total nuber of beats used in
Oakie's sets at C r e a m over the last two
years! Out now.
S o u n d o f Eukatech II

A great d o u b l e C D a l b u m with over
two hours o f cutting e d g e u n d e r g r o u n d

a l b u m represents the music w h i c h is
released o n the Eukatech label a n d
w h i c h is sold in the Eukatcch record
shop. The t e c h n o C D represents the
London techno scene with artists such as
Ha-Lo, Bigfoot and Reck, whilst the sec-
o n d C D Is a h o u s e c o m p i l a t i o n a n d
includes production by W i g g l e resident

'Modernistic Acid Trance'
Crap hardcore a l b u m ( n o n e of the
tracks are any good.) - and that's really all
I can say. Out in May.
Pills
'Electrocalne'
felix's French c o n n e c t i o n contin-
ues with this top-quality French tech-
h o u s e a l b u m . I u s i n g h o u s e , funk,
t e c h n o a n d tech-house, the C D starts
off at a hectic pace a n d stays there all
t h r o u g h o u t . The tracks use guitar licks,
a 303, s h r e d d e d vocal chants, acid bass
lines nad beakbeat loops with a hint of
pop. It's a great a l b u m w h i c h y o u don't
get sick of listening to. C'est formidable.

A l b u m s by G u r m
Silver Planet Records Special
A n excellent lable o p e r a t i n g f r o m
Notting Hill, a n d w h i c h we'll have m o r e
news of later in the term. Their latest
a l b u m is 'Solid Silver' a n d is an excellent
a l b u m of the best progressive h o u s e
tracks currently d o i n g the business in
the clubs. If y o u n e e d to c o m p a r e it to
s o m e t h i n g then try an O a k e n f o l d a l b u m
- great d e e p tracks w h i c h y o u c o u l d
spend ages listening to. Tracks include
T h e Band' by M a r c o /affarano, 'Rhthym
Climber' by PVZ a n d the excellent 'The
Journey1
by Sadie Glutz. The list of remix-
ers is also impressive a n d includes Way
O u t West a n d Paul Van Dyk. A truly
great a l b u m - out In May.

Silver Planet will also be releasing a
f e w singles a n d E.Ps i n c l u d i n g Denki
Groove's 'NiJi' remixes. This is a great sin-
gle with mixes f r o m Paul Van Dyk a n d
f r o m Mijk Van Dijk (I w o n d e r if Dick Van
Dyk will d o one?). The PVD remix is a
powerful progressive track with lots of
d e e p beats, instrumentals, a n d pianos,
whilst t h e M V D remix is m o r e h o u s e
s o u n d i n g but very weird.
• • • • •
Also being released is the 1999 remix
of 'Lust' by Velocity. This is a g o o d pro-
gressive tune with d e e p beats a n d bass
but has a very catchy tune to it. The sin-
gle features remixes f r o m Slander, LSG,
and a G-Watt remix. The Slander remix
isn't too bad, following the original quite
closely. The G-Watt mix is crap but the
best of the lot is the LSG remix w h i c h is
a fantastic j o u r e n y t h r o u g h prog, house.
Lust' is out now.
