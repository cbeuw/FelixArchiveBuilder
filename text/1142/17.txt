o f f i c e hit. A l t h o u g h t h e film represents
e v e r y t h i n g that his beliefs a r e against,

f r o m t h e n o n , it gets silly, with a Chi-

E v e n - t h o u g h this film is a cross
b e t w e e n P o w e r Rangers, a Jackie C h a n
film a n d B o o g i e Nights, it h a s all t h e
m a k i n g s o f a cult classic, as it is s o orig-
inal. Parker directs Orgazmo in a freshly
i n t e r e s t i n g style a n d h e also s h o w s
great p r o m i s e as a script writer t o o .
M o s t o f t h e p e o p l e in this film have n o
acting ability at all apart from Parker a n d
a f e w select others but this just m a k e s
the film funnier. Q

Attempting to unite t h e success o f Lock
Stock & Two Smoking Barrels w i t h t h e
classic British c o s t u m e drama, Plunkett &

It's directed by Jake " s o n o f Ridley"
Scott a n d stars Robert Carlyle a n d Jonny
Lee Miller as a pair o f ultra-cool e i g h -
teenth century h i g h w a y m e n a n d Liv Tyler
as the obligatory be-corsetted love inter-
est. It's far from serious - slow-motion,
fireworks a n d dry ice c a n b e f o u n d in

The Exorcist
By finally getting a video release, The
Exorcist is b o u n d t o receive a massive
a m o u n t o f m e d i a coverage. Sadly, how-
ever, those w h o g o out and rent it in the
expectation o f a horrific, gory Satan fest
will b e sorely disappointed. Twenty-Six
years after its first tour o f the cinemas, the
goal-posts have m o v e d to such an extent
that a nation of s e a s o n e d cincmagoers
won't even find The Exorcist particularly
frightening.
Nonetheless, it remains a brilliant
(and fairly nasty) thriller, taught and claus-
t r o p h o b i c in its e x e c u t i o n , that fully
deserves the 'classic' tag which it so fre-
quently receives.
A Perfect
Murder
Artistically, t h e virtue o f remaking Hitch-
cock 90's-stylc with G w y n c t h Paltrow a n d
Michael Douglas in the leading roles may
be dubious, but from a monetary point
of view it's got profit written all over it.
The directors o f re-makes like this
always talk about b r o a d e n i n g a movie's
appeal, a n d in this case it's probably true.
Admittedly it's not as g o o d as t h e origi-
nal, but the quality of the plot, alongside
D o u g l a s ' hammy-but-enjoyable evil
schtick and s o m e nifty camerawork make
for a decent night-in nonetheless.

Goldmine
O h dear. O n c e again t w a n M c G r e g o r
proves that just b e c a u s e his n a m e is
attatched to a movie, it's n o guarantee of
quality. Indeed, for every decent movie
he's b e e n in, you'll probably find at least
o n e suck-lost. Worse still, by following-up
his role in The Avengers with a support-
ing p e r f o r m a n c e here, Eddie Izzard is
hardly m a k i n g t h e best o f his fledgling
acting career.
Essentially, h o w e v e r , it's director
Todd I laynes w h o must shoulder the
blame, rather than his stars. H e deliber-
ately sets o u t to m a k e a m o v i e s o
devoted to frenzied 70's-retro styling that
he ignores plot or characterisation - which
leaves t w o hours o f painful glam-rock
costumes, a n d precious little else.
