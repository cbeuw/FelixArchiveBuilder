The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at Imperial C o l l e g e
Success for IC's Second Ball
The summer ball is definitely g o i n g ahead
at Alexandra Palace o n Friday 25 June. The
decision to confirm the event w a s taken
despite the sponsorship problems the ball
has been facing, leaving the s u m m e r ball
committee with the daunting but a c c o m -
plishable task of acquiring funds for the ball
this term. David Hellard, ICU President,
has w e l c o m e d t h e news, assuring stu-
dents that "anyone w h o goes will love it."
The s u m m e r ball w a s in a n d out o f
financial difficulties for m u c h o f last term
('Summer Ball's Sponsorship Ordeal, Felix
issue 1134), after a succession o f s p o n -
sorship deals with various c o m p a n i e s fell
through. It had been h o p e d that Procter &
Gamble would provide a large a m o u n t o f
money for the event - in a n email dated 19
february a representative stated that sev-
eral recruiters "would like to offer s o m e
sponsorship". O n 21 March, however, Proc-
ter & Gamble decided to pull out o f the
deal. O n the same w e e k e n d Unilever also
pulled out, leaving t h e ball without a n y
major sponsors. Since then the committee
has had s o m e success, with sponsorship
from Goldmann Sachs and L'Oreal looking
likely.
More progress has been m a d e thanks
By Ed Sexton
to the Alumni Office, under the guidance
of Clive Oakley, with £3000 to £5000 n o w
l o o k i n g like a n achievable a m o u n t o f
m o n e y from old Imperial students. Approx-
imately £2000 in sponsorship w a s also
obtained over Easter. College, however,
have been less forthcoming. Nick Griffith,
Chairman of the s u m m e r ball committee,
presented college with a proposal
Intended to e n c o u r a g e sponsorship o f
the ball s o m e time ago. In Ihe proposal he
pointed out that such a n event "reflects
highly o n the college" a n d w o u l d attract
alumni a n d staff, as well as current stu-
dents. If the ball b e c a m e an annual event,
like t h e M a y balls at Oxford a n d C a m -
bridge, it could also promote Imperial in
the m e d i a a n d industry sectors. College
rejected these arguments, with the Deputy
Rector insisting that he could not give
m o n e y from his funds, as these are
reserved for a c a d e m i c d e v e l o p m e n t s .
Dave Hellard s u m m e d up h o w he saw the
College's position,- "anything to do with the
students should b e funded by the Union".
Currently a further £7500 is n e e d e d ,
assuming 1500 tickets are sold (generating
just over £80,000). The Union has under-
written the event, m e a n i n g that any short-
fall will have to met from t h e Union's
reserve funds, "tickets arc £10 more than
last year, costing £55 for students. Nick Grif-
fith justified the increase by explaining the
variety of attractions that should b e present
at this year's ball. The event should include
a b i g w h e e l , a classic horse carousel,
dodgems, a casino, a cover band a n d ,
hopefully, a guest speaker. Coaches to
the event a r c being provided by Capital
Coaches, a n d should hopefully b e better
organised than last year, w h e n most of the
coaches w e r e late.
As well as praising the Alumni Office,
Nick Griffith cautiously w e l c o m e d t h e
Union's support, thinking that "the sabbs
deserve s o m e credit". Feelings towards
the ball in the U n i o n have b e e n mixed,
mainly due to the serious financial problem
that will result if tickets d o not sell well.
Another contentious issue is the relation-
ship between the ball and the ICSM s u m -
mer ball, which is scheduled to take place
the day before IC's, o n Thursday 24 June.
Wade Gayed, ICSM president, was insistent
that he d i d support the IC ball, but w a s
mindful that there arc "strong feelings for
a separate ball in ICSM". Although sup-
portive of the idea of a c o m b i n e d ball, he
felt that the medical merger was not long
e n o u g h a g o t o stage such a n event; "one
year is too soon to expect a single ball... no
medics are g o i n g lo IC's ball, except first
years". Dave Hellard agreed that a lot of first
year medics w o u l d c o m e to IC's ball, a n d
said h e could "understand w h y they want
their o w n ball", but went o n to claim "ours
will b e better". The s u m m e r ball has sur-
vived the politics a n d financial troubles,
however; n o w it is u p to t h e students t o
m a k e it a success.

Medics Football Fall from Grace
ICSM Football has sensationally b e e n
stripped of the First Division Championship,
as a result of last minute wranglings from
arch-rivals Guy's, Kings and Thomas' (GKT).
The Kings M e d i c s successfully
appealed against t w o fixtures, in which
they claimed ICSM Firsts h a d fielded a
ringer, in t h e shape o f Dr Jonathan
Houghton. Dr Houghton completed his
course last year, a n d consequently is n o
longer eligible for UL competition, but it is
believed that h e has played in all but t w o
games of the season. Indeed, if the results
of all the games in which his name appears
on the teamsheet w e r e overturned, ICSM
would b e left with just six points - a n d
would face relegation to the Second Divi-
sion.
Crucially, t h e reversal o f t h e t w o
matches (in both o f which Dr Houghton
scored) means a six point swing from ICSM
to GKT, moving the Kings Medics to 43
points, a n d thus into first place, earing
By David Roberts
t h e m promotion to the Premier Division
(where they replace the relegated Royal
School of Mines squad). Meanwhile, ICSM
Firsts drop into third place, behind UCL's sec-
ond string.
the ultimate placings, however, arc.
still not final. ICSM have appealed against
the decision, and, although their appeal has
been rejected by UL Sports League Co-
ordinator Ruth Crawford at the first stage,
the final decision o f Neil Walker (ULU's
Sports Officer) w a s not known at time of
going to press. Whilst it is possible that the
ICSM victories over GKT could be reinstated,
the appeal also carries with it considerable
dangers, as an appeals panel would have,
in Ruth Crawford's words, "every opportu-
nity to take whatever decision they felt
appropriate...it is not beyond the realms o f
possibility that they could d e e m voiding of
all matches a possibility"- In this way, every
match in which Dr Houghton played would
be declared an opposition walkover, a n d
thus ICSM would be relegated to Division
Two. If that were not bad e n o u g h , the
knock-on effect would be the automatic
d e m o t i o n o f ICSM Seconds to Division
Three, as UL rules state that no reserve team
may play In the same division as their firsts.
However, the most likely scenario
remains the current status quo, as eligibil-
ity cannot usually be disputed after a match,
unless (as in this case) the player con-
cerned failed to produce a valid ID w h e n
asked to do so by the opposlton on the day
of the match. Consequently, as GKT arc the
only side to have disputed eligibility, the two
matches which have already been voided
are the only ones which can realistically be
called into question.
Unfortunately, none of the ICSM squad
were available for comment - we'll bring
you the final decision next week.
