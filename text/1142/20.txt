Seven Go Mad In Dublin
Darts
Holland Club Take Brakespear Title
Early o n Saturday, 27 March, the seven of
us (GS: Sally May, GA: Sarah Coburn, WA:
Paula McGuigan, G Vlkki Revell, WD: Kirstie
Gosland: GD: Rachel Urwin, GK: Alex Haley)
left the Union in a somewhat sorry state
for our long awaited Netball Tour to Dublin.
Our heads felt like a quiet coach journey,
but unfortunately sharing our coach with
31 Essex girls was not the ideal remedy for
our headaches. With the prospect of six
matches in t w o days, the o d d s o n all of us
returning alive, injury free a n d
un-hungover were not g o o d .
O n Saturday night w e explored the
pubs and bars in Dublin a n d an adventur-
ous three investigated a local club a n d its
Irish talent well Into the early hours.
The first match o n Sunday was against
Liverpool feds, which w e lost 14-7 because
Paula w a s going t o b e sick (okay - they
went on to win), and then w e played Essex
A and w o n 10-5. In the evening w e w e n t
out for Rachel's birthday meal a n d seriously
over-ate, b e c o m i n g far too fat to fit in o n e
taxi and having to take t w o taxis h o m e
again.
The next day s o m e of us (Sarah, Vikki,
Rachel and Sally) were up bright and early,
as Sarah had to umpire the first match. W e
then went o n to play two matches in a row,
beating Essex B 7-4 a n d then narrowly los-
ing to Aston 9-7. Impressed by Trinity's
sandwich facilities, w e w e r e then refu-
elled with e n o u g h energy t o play our
match o f t h e t o u r n a m e n t versus t h e
hosts - Trinity. Everyone played stormingly
with s o m e quality t e a m w o r k a n d
sequences including Sally's cunning " h o p
and shoot" tactics ensuring a resounding
10-8 victory (IC scoring 2 5 % more goals
than trinity as Alex rightly pointed out). By
the way, Alex finally w o k e up o n M o n d a y
to give it her all against a n annoyingly
g o o d GS in the final match. It was a close
fought affair with us eventually losing to
University College Dublin 8-7, leaving us 3rd
overall.
Highlights included Paula's displays
of gymnastic tumbling both o n and off
court, o n c e sprawling into the Trinity team
w h o w e r e watching from the sidelines.
Sarah a n d Vikki perfected their o w n text
b o o k version of the IC centre pass, w h e r e
the ball travelled from the centre circle to
the goal in 4 moves completely ignoring
the rest o f the team. The mystery o f "that
pink stain" o n Rachel's airtex was finally
solved o n the last day w h e n it w a s identi-
fied as Sarah's blackcurrant drink. However,
w e all b e c a m e slightly concerned about
Paula's growing ability to pass to imaginary
12-foot tall p e o p l e standing 20 miles
behind other team members. Delusion or
alcohol? W e suspect the latter.
All in all w e had a fantastic tour a n d
Sally tried o n every pair of black trousers in
Dublin. Special thanks g o to Sarah Coburn
for umpiring numerous other matches o n
the tour. Remember girls, "What goes o n
tour, stays o n tour!" (Essex Netball Squad,
1999).
