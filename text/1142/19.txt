With Tiberian Sun still h i d d e n away a n d
Starcraft starting to creak, there is a future
for a g a m e that can take t h e C o m m a n d
a n d C o n q u e r g a m e ideas, m i x t h e m
about a n d apply the latest graphics. Well
the future's bright, the future's orange for
W a r z o n e 2100.
O n c e again a rogue Al has triggered
a nuclear e x c h a n g e , bringing the e n d of
the world as w e k n o w it. A s the c o m -
mander o f o n e o f the g r o u p s o f sur-
vivors your task is to attempt to bring
back a little bit o f that o l d e w o r l d c h a r m
by finding the remnants o f pre-war tech-
nology before the o p p o s i t i o n . Did I for-
get to m e n t i o n that your g r o u p w a s not
the only b u n c h o f survivors? O u t in the
desert, in the cities, a n d in the mountains
there are other less friendly g r o u p s w h o
also want the technologies
a n d arc m o r e than willing
to force the point with a
f e w well placed bullets.
O n your side is a f e w
trucks a n d a h a n d f u l o f
a r m o u r e d cars. N o t t h e
most impressive o f p e a c e
k e e p i n g forces, but give
the trucks e n o u g h time to
build factories a n d y o u
have your o w n p e r s o n a l
production line. M a k e the
trucks build research labs
a n d a n y remnants picked up a l o n g the
w a y give y o u i m p r o v e m e n t s such as
tracked vehicles, n e w w e a p o n s , even
n e w bits to put o n vehicles - like c u p
holders.
O n e o f t h e best features is t h e
d e s i g n s c r e e n
f r o m w h e r e y o u
c a n p i e c e 1
together r a n d o m
bits a n d bobs, to
design incredibly
fast scout cars or
big, bulky c a n -
non wielding bat-
tle tanks - or if
y o u are o d d ,
slow bulky scouts
a n d small fast
a n d fragile tanks.
Later o n y o u get
hovercraft a n d vTOL
aircraft a d d e d to the
arsenal.
Having so many
o p t i o n s available
the g a m e c o u l d
have b e e n a real
n i g h t m a r e to c o n -
trol but the simple
control interface allows y o u to fight,
research, c o m m a n d a n d build without
n e e d i n g to use twenty keys at o n c e . The
c o m m a n d interface for instance allows
y o u to direct a group to fire f r o m various
ranges, c h a n g e their state o f alert or
even cease fire all within seconds.
The graphics take the best graphics
from this genre a n d notch it u p several
levels. N o t
only can y o u
c h a n g e t h e
v i e w i n g
direction, but
also t h e ele-
v a t i o n . It's
better look-
ing than the
v i e w f r o m a
LI 6 cockpit,
a n d twice as
clear.
So apart f r o m the story w h a t can I
m o a n about? Occasionally the Al decides
that your forces w o u l d m u c h prefer to
take o n the e n e m y c a m p straight o n
rather than f o l l o w i n g t h e safer route
r o u n d the back, but the Al both o f your
a n d the e n e m y ' s forces arc still a c o m -
plete leap a h e a d o f earlier g a m e s . There
is even a c o m m a n d to w i t h d r a w forces
after suffering d a m a g e , w h i c h can save
e v e n the most stupid o f generals a n d is
also used by the c o m p u t e r forces to pre-
serve its limited forces. Lor o n c e here is
a g a m e w h e r e e n g a g i n g in battles o f
attrition will fail, yet limited sacrifices are
also not heavily penalised. With the addi-
tion o f a multiplayer o p t i o n it rolls over
the opposition a n d crushes t h e m without
mercy. For those without exams prepare
to lose sleep, for t h o s e with exams I
take n o responsibility for the results.

Commandos - Beyond the Call of Duty (PC)
This g a m e is hard, very very hard. After
several hours o f effort o n t h e easiest
level, I m a n a g e d to sneak m y little group
of World War 2 h a r d e n e d killers, snipers
and explosives experts through the island
fortress planting explosives a n d removing
the o d d G e r m a n guard that h a d l o o k e d
at m e in a strange way.
I got to the extraction beach, blew
the charges a n d readied the rubber raft
to escape the island. It w a s then I s a w the
minefield just off the beach, discovered
the island w a s crawling with guards a n d
that I n e e d e d to g o back a n d finish off a
f e w o f the Anti-aircraft g u n positions.
Time to reload a n d try again.
for those that missed
the original c o m m a n d o s ,
the g a m e features the
actions o f a group o f very
special specialists w h o take
the very nastiest a n d dirtiest
missions. It is your j o b to
guide t h e m from a distance
a n d prevent t h e m b e i n g
captured, shot a n d b e i n g
detected, while completing
the mission in the shortest
possible time.
Hint number one : It
might appear to be smart to massacre the
whole garrison but It is usually not advis-
able to start an open war while you are
outnumbered and your weapon of
choice Is a sharp knife.
Thus r u n n i n g in a n d s h o o t i n g o f f
your pistols arc not the smartest o f Ideas,
but crawling up to people a n d s h o o t i n g
t h e m in the back with a h a r p o o n g u n or
sniper rifle is. Unfortunately while a dead
guard can not call his friends, his friends
tend to get a bit j u m p y a n d will hit the
panic alert button if they s e e their buddy
with a h a r p o o n in his back. Removing
bodies from view b e c o m e s a big a n d
messy task.
The graphics are detailed in the
extreme - the lapping of the s e a o n walls
a n d beaches o n the first level, the seag-
ulls floating by, a n d the buildings t h e m -
selves all create the impression y o u are
in a c o m m a n d o s movie. It is not just a
pretty picture t h o u g h . There is the ability
to z o o m in a n d out, a n d create several
w i n d o w s to monitor m o r e than o n e area
at once.
The s o u n d , while not b e i n g perfect,
d o e s g o towards c o m p l e t i n g the impres-
sion o f a movie, with various stereotypi-
cal accents taking t h e voices o f t h e
different characters - the b i g hard g u y is
a scouser, a n d the sniper a cool sophis-
ticated upper class gent. The
other sounds are just aver-
age, but in a g a m e w h e r e
brain and appropriate action
arc the rule y o u w o u l d n o l
expect a loud a n d explosive
soundtrack, the gentle rush
of the s e a o n the beach a n d
the quiet snap o f a silenced
rifle are about as urgent as
y o u get.
W h i l e t h e g a m e is
graphically pretty, has game-
play in a b u n d a n c e a n d has
a very easy a n d well thought out control
m e t h o d , it is horrendously difficult even
on the easiest level. It is this reason a n d
this alone that will put off all except the
most c o m m i t t e d o f c o m m a n d o s a n d
strategy fans, l o r the average gamcplaycr
the g a m e loses s o m e o f its appeal a n d
gets b o g g e d d o w n in the constant saves
a n d reloads n e e d e d to be able to finish
a situation that y o u h a d thought w a s
c o m p l e t e , but h a d just b e c o m e a big
d e a d e n d . It is a very g o o d g a m e spoilt
purely by its difficulty - definitely o n e for
the strategy guys but will not impress
the action fanatics.
