SOCCER
C.& G. 0, R.C.S. 3
In the f i r s t round of the Technology Cup,
played on Nov. 8th at Harlington, the R.C.S.,
present holders of the cup, deservedly defeat-
ed the Guilds 3-0.
.Facing a young gale, Guilds spent most of
the f i r s t half defending stubbornly while the
R.C.S. forwards seemed unable to make the most
of their opportunities. There was no score at
half-time.
In the fourth minute of the second half
R.C.S. went ahead, Thompson putting the f i n i s h -
ing touch to good work by Dixon and Jackman.
Play continued unevenly u n t i l 13 minutes from
'ime when R.C.S. were awarded an indirect free
kick i n the Guilds penalty area. Dixon pass-
ed low across the goal to Browne whose f i r s t
time shot beat Williams. R.CS. were well on
top at this stage, and, five minutes from the
end, a free kick, taken by Manson, resulted i n
Jackman shooting into the bottom of the net.
Both goals had escapes, but R.C.S. appear-
ed particularly fortunate when Reynolds failed
to hold a high centre only for a Guilds toe to
put the ball the wrong side of the post.
The teams were as follows:
C.& G.: Williams (capt.); Wilkinson, Ward;
Hitchen, Eastland, Last; Jewitt,
Wheeler, Ball, Hailing, Morris.
R.C.S.: Reynolds (L); Lodge, Manson; Webb,
Taylor (RG), Buckroyd; Browne,Watson,
Thompson (DE) (capt.), Jackman, Dixon.

RUGGER
In the f i r s t round of the U.L. cup, the
I.C. XV drew 3-3 against last year's winners,
the Royal Veterinary College.
In the f i r s t half the Vets used the wind
to great advantage and although I.C. played
well together and fought out much of the game
near the centre line, the Vets scrum half once
eluded serveral players and made an opening for
a tx-y which was not converted.
The second half was played almost entirely
in the Vets half, and in typical cup rugger,the
outside had few chances of working out movements
likely to lead to tries. It was through a pen-
alty, well kicked by Chester, that the match
w'i s drawn.
I.C. can regard this match with some satis-
faction. They played good robust rugger ag-
ainst competent opponents and there was no 6b-
vious manoeuvre by which victory could have been
achieved. There are potential match winners i n
the I.C. side but the game just did not go their
way. If they have nore to do i n the replay on
Nov. 18th, I.C. should go through to the second
round.

BOXING
The boxing club gave Kings a good hiding
on Nov. 7th, winning five of the six contests.
The f i r s t match was between Coppelham and
J. Reavey of Kings. It was not until the 3rd
round that the I.C. man came into his own, but
the end of the fight saw him a convincing win-
ner.
Mike Humphreys, the I.C. Vice-captain,pun-
ished R. Gray so severely about the head that
that referee stopped the fight i n the third
round.
After John Gordon-Smith (I.C.) had beaten
P.Donniscn on points and B i l l Favger (I.C.) had
lost narrowly on points to A. Dujon, the Kings
star turn, we were entertained by what may now
be called "the fight of the evening".
Hulme, the I.C. Captain, stepped into the
ring to oppose L. Corsak of Kings. " K i l l e r "
lived up to his name f o r the fight had to be
stopped in the third round. Corsak collapsed
soon after he had climbed out of the ring and
a double brandy was required to revive him.
Last of a l l we saw the heavyweight contest
betv/een John B o t t e r i l l (I.C.) and E. Lucas of
Kings- John, thinking that he had to win his
fight f o r I.C. to win the match went a l l out
and with some damaging blows reshapedhis oppo-
nent' s body to his liking.
Altogether a very successful evening.
