MORPHY DAY
By our Bowing Correspondent.
Some thirty years ago, the f i r s t race f o r
the Morphy Cup took place, since when i t has
been won on five occasions by the R.S.M.B.C.,
three by the B.C.S.B.C. and on a l l others by
the C.&. G.B.C. This f i r s t race occurred ah-
out the time of the formation of the Imperial
College Boat Club soon after the f i r s t world
war, when the three College Boat-Clubs amalg-
amated to represent Imperial College i n regat-
tas. As the years passed, this amalgamation
became more and more complete, and today the
three Boat-Clubs only exist f o r the purpose of
an annual boatrace between their respective
crews - at a l l other times their members row
under I.C. colours.
In 1943 each college had a second eight
in training to assist i n coaching their Morphy
crew. On a challenge from R.C.S. an unoffic-
i a l race between these second eights was i n s t i -
tuted and continued as a challenge match u n t i l
19*6, when i t became a permanent fixture by the
presentation of a cup for the event by Mr. and
Mrs. Lowry - the Lowry Cup. Apart from an
R.C.S. victory i n 1948, the Guilds have had a
monopoly of this trophy.
THIS YEAR'S CREWS
Next Wednesday, the three College Boat-Clubs
w i l l again be competing for these two trophies.
At the time of writing Mines are undoubtedly f a -
vourites. They are a strong, workmanlike crew,
who attack the beginning really hard, with the
f u l l intent of using the blade to move the boat.
Their chief weakness at the moment i s a lack of
solidity at the f i n i s h , but i n spite of this
their recovery i s good and l i v e l y with a nice
swing forward as the boat runs. Mackay, at s t -
roke i s setting a good rhythm and a surprising-
ly long stroke for so short a man, and i s well
backed up at seven by Maltby who rowed at Bed-
ford School. Davidson i s an enthusiastic six,
whilst Nind from St. Catherine's ,Cambridge,
combines power with smoothness at five. The
R.C.S., though they lack the surge of power on
the beginning which characterises the Mines crew
i s the neatest of the three boats. Theblade-
work i s better and more together and the finish-
es more solid. The recovery, however, i s slow-
er and more ponderous with the resultant lack of
time on the last b i t forward, causing a sluggish
beginning and not so much run on the boat. Sly
from T i f f i n s School at seven and Seaman from St.
Paul's at six provide a good backing for Metcal-
fe who stroked last summer's I.C. boat at Henley.
The "heavies" i n the middle of the boat are neat
but inclined to be slow with their hands away.
The Guilds are not so far advanced a s their r i v -
als , and though working hard are not so well to-
gether and s t i l l inclined to be rough and heavy
handed. However, with North as Cox (worth a
ninth oar i n the boat) and Johnny Miners on the
bank, they w i l l undoubtedly improve rapidly dur-
ing the next week and w i l l be a crew tote reckon-
ed with by Morphy Day. A few deeply rooted fau-
l t s i n some members of the crew may, however,
prove to be too much should i t come to hard race
and a close f i n i s h .
PROSPECTS
At the moment the Mines look the crew most
l i k e l y to win, but a race of one and five-eighths
miles i n a heavy clinker boat i s no respecter of
reputations, and much may happen i n the next week.
The Guilds look like winning the Lowry Cup
again, their crew having much more experience of
racing and regattas than either of their oppon-
ents. The latter crews, however, w i l l give a
very good account of themselves and are not Like-
ly to be left behing without fighting hard. The
extreme lightness of the R.C.S. compared with the
Mines may t e l l against them over the latter part
of the course should they have the misfortune to
encounter a s t i f f head wind.
The races w i l l be started by Charles Bris-
ton from the towpath and umpired by Freddy Page
of the Thames Rowing Club from the Umpires' lau-
nch. The judges w i l l be Mr. G.C. Lowry and
Mr. R.D. Hoyle.
CROSS COUNTRY
The U.L. t r i a l s and subsequent I.C. t r i a l s
have proved most encouraging, and although Ted
Whitlock i s once again the only really outstan-
ding runner, the general standard i s quite high.
The second team started off very well on
Wed, Nov. 1st, beating U.C. and Q.M.C. quite
conclusively, by virtur of some very good pack-
ing. I.C.'2',39 - U . C ' 2 ' , 7 1 - Q.M.C.'2',76.
The 1st team had their f i r s t match of the
season against Southampton University on Sat.
Nov. 4th, over 4& miles at Roehampton; although
without the services of Whitlock, whowas runn-
ing for U.L., the team won quite easily.
I.C. 32 - S'ton 51.
The packing was again very good, I.C. pro-
viding seven out of the f i r s t nine men home.
Goater (S) was f i r s t , i n 27 min. 29 sec.,
and Davies (I.C.) second i n 27 min. 33 sec.
WOMEN'S HOCKEY
On Wednesday, Nov. 1st, the I.C. Women's
Hockey XI played Goldsmith's 2nd XI. This
was the f i r s t women's team to be fielded for
about 2 sessions, with the exception of the
team which met with seccess i n the Inter-Col-
legiate tournament. As this i s the case, and
as there was no opportunity for t r i a l s , the fact
that I.C. lost 3-0 need cause no despondency.
The players combined well on the whole, and on-
ce the forwards get used to playing with each
other, and the half-backs play a more attaching
game the team should have a reasonably success-
ful season.

HOCKEY v. Queen Mary Coll. Lost 3 - 7
NETBALL v. Queen Mary Coll. Lost 9 -10
