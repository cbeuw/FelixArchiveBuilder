Sir,
We would like to state how much we deprec-
ate the action which took place this morning,
resulting i n the debagging of the "Daily Worker"
salesman.
This behaviour on the part of a large crowd
of students towards a fellow citizen of a demo-
cratic country i s i n the worst "communistic"
taste, and i s a very bad advertisement, expeeial-
ly when the student body i s protesting against
the suppression of ragging. The only good i t
can do i s towards the Communists themselves.
Surely these rags, i f they are to survive
as a healthy form ofstudent high s p i r i t s , should
only take place between students and colleges.
Once they are taken out to the general public
they become anti-social and merit the disapprov-
al they now enjoy.
The C.& G. Union President's remark that
excess energy i s more profitably dissipated i n
the various athletic clubs i s surely good ad-
vice.

At the f i n a l meeting of the now dissolved
Imperial College Student Industrial Committee
I was requested to investigate the possibility
of holding an annual conference of the Academ-
i c Societies. This conference was to concern
i t s e l f mainly with social aspects of industry,
besides providing a meeting ground for the
interchange of ideas, and the discussion of
common problems.
I am accordingly calling a meeting of the
officers of the societies concerned and should
be much obliged i f you would publish this l e t -
ter i n order to give individual members a chan-
ce to inform their officers of their points of
view.

Sir,
In the "Pnoenix Review- publlsned at the
beginning of term there appeared a letter com-
menting on two anomalies i n College courses.
The second of these was that the best degrees
go to the unsociable "brown-bagger", summed up
in the phrase "To those who give nothing while
they are here, the College gives most as they
leave". May I, as a semi-"brown-bagger", be
allowed the hospitality of your columns to re-
ply to this?
Surely i t i s the man with the good degree
who brings most honour to the College i n the
world outside. I can imagine an employer say-
ing: "These fellows from C.& G. (R.C.S., R.S.M)
do not know their stuff!" He does not care
whether they were arrested on a certain occas-
ion due to excess of College s p i r i t , or were
members of f i f t y societies. Again, i t i s the
academic record of the College which induces
outside bodies to sponsor research fellowships
and other grants and to make large gifts to the
College, e.g. the Goldsmiths extension to C.&G.
May I suggest that the maintaining of a
flow of Ist and 2nd class Honours Degrees i s
essential to the existence and well-being of
the College rather than a mammoth social and
cultural organisation.

ox J . - ,
We are inspired by the recent Lord Mayor's
Show to write and suggest that the students of
London University hold a similar (but much bet-
ter) procession.
According to i t s size, each college could
contribute one or more tableaux to i l l u s t r a t e
some chosen theme such as "Students through the
Ages", "From Kindergarten to the Professions",
etc. etc. Lent term would be a suitable time
and the occasion could be the inauguration of
the new U.L.U. President. Perhaps we could
persuade the Chief Commissioner of Police to
o f f i c i a l l y receive the procession at Bow Streeb
Police Station.
Advantage could be taken of the occasion
to make a collection for State ITn-aided Char-
i t i e s (such as the Police Orphanage!) which
would give us a measure of public support.
An annual student pageant of this kind
would be a great event for students and pub-
l i c alike and would provide a unique occasion
for intercollegiate co-operation. A l i t t l e
restraint would at f i r s t be required u n t i l
our prerogative be firmly established.
A l l that i s required i s some enthusiastic
suppcrt from the colleges and some hard work
on the part of a few efficient organisers.

S i r ,
I feel i t necessary to correct immediate-
ly a crass error i n your last: you refer to Bo
as "she'.'
The name Boanerges, meaning "Sons of Fury"
or "Sons of Thunder" was the name given to the
sons of Zebedee, and later by T.E.Lawrence to
one of his moter cycles.
Anyone who has heard the present Bo's sten-
torian voice w i l l realize that there i s nothing
feminine about him, unless i t be his somewhat
capricious nature, and so doubts as to his sex
must be quickly dispelled lest some misguided
scientist should be tempted to shout "Boanerges"
in a feminine treble at his next public appear-
ance.

S i r ,
Your correspondant, who complains about
the person or persons who abstract the "New
Statesman" and "Spectator" from the lounge
for the alleged selfish purpose of privately
perusing the paragrammatical p h i l l i p i e s of
those popular periodicals, w i l l have appealed
to your readers as refreshingly naive.
I am not, of course, i n the confidence of
the purloiner(s), but a deep and personal ac-
quaintance with human f r a i l t y suggests to me
at least, that the perisher(s) i n question
do'nt pinch those journals to read 'em, but
to offer them up (or down) to Cloacina.*
