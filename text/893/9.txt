MUSIC
'We live it up in hell
W e destroy rock and roll'
Expounding the gospel of 'heroin-tainted
rock 'n' roll' to the disciples of anarchy
and anyone else who cares to listen, the
Manic Street Preachers have exploded
onto the music scene over the last few
weeks.

—Motown Junk 12"
'...every 14-year old who sees us
doesn't care that we sound awful. He
goes home, sells his record collection and
wants to burn down Barclays Bank...'
they told N M E . A r e they for real?
This comes from four w o r k i n g class
Welsh boys wearing eyeliner, tight white
trousers and a nice line in home-made
shirts, featuring such significant slogans as
'Culture of Destruction' and 'Condemned
to Rock 'n' Roll'.
'We're the most brilliant band, I think, in
the last fifteen years, just because we
don't want to do what's been done
before' they announced on S N U B T V .
Released on the small indie l a b e l -
Heavenly, Motown Junk is apparently
their third single. There are two other
tracks—Sorrow 16 and We Her Majesty's
Prisoners. A l l three feature fast and
furious guitars and should be played very
loudly, but their punky style sounds
somewhat dated. Original and brilliant
they are not, but they're not bad and
they certainly k n o w how to get noticed.
If they concentrated more o n making
music instead of talking shite they might
get somewhere.

LP
I just managed to hear this E P over the
noise of Blue Monday w h i c h the flat
below insist on playing very loudly and
very often. This is the debut single of The
Starlings who originally come from New
Zealand. There are five tracks—starting
with a cover of The Byrds classic Wasn't
Born to Follow, with added dance b e a t -
how very original. The title track Letter
from Heaven was inspired by the story of
a convicted drug smuggler who is hung
before his mother receives his last letter.
Hence the title: Letter from Heaven. The
words (there aren't many of them) are
sung over bluesy riffs, ending with 'Look
into the eyes of death and never feel
your baby's breath' (apparently a
quotation from an episode of The
WaltonsW).
T w o of the three songs o n the B-side
seem to reveal an obsession about razor
blades. Razor Girl—'She cut 666 into m y
skin' and 'Helloween Candy—there's razor
blades in the Helloween Candy' (??) aren't
really worth a mention. (Please note that
Helloween is not a spelling mistake.) The
final track, My Sympathy, has a definite
Velvet Underground feel to it. Lou Reed-
type vocals glide over an acoustic guitar,
nicely helped along by some
'atmospheric' backing vocals. I haven't a
clue what they are singing about, but it
sounds good.

Rose (Felixist extraordinaire) has likened
this record to quote Chelsea supporters
on acid unquote. I cannot better this
description except to say that the avid is
of the inspirational rather than musical
variety. Manufacture are obviously of the
industrial school of thought with massive
bass and vague electro twitterings
swamped in a terrace anthem, but this
12" has none of the power or interest of
similar waxings.
The flip contains two remixes of a track
that didn't require one.
Assuming y o u ever find a copy, don't
bother.

Echo & The
Bunnymen
-ULU 6.2.91
Spring, the time for rejuvenation, flowers,
sun and little white rabbits hopping
around making even more hopping
rabbits. Its a shame the same can't be
said for Echo and the Bunnyen.
They combined perfectly with the
monotinous and boring supports to
produce an evening I have easily
forgotten.
M y only memory is a fixteen stone
stage diver that managed to completly
miss the audience and colide face down
with the floor. H o w anyone could stage
dive to The B u n n y m e n I can't understand
but people managed it despite the efforts
of a very slow hippy.
Everytime somebody got up onto the
stage he ran out only to be a second late
and see them land face d o w n in the
crowd. The one time he was nearly on
time he seemed hesitant as to what to do.
The result, a very shocked man hitting
the floor six feet below.
Sorry, but w h e n you are more
interested in the light show than the band
its a bad sign.
