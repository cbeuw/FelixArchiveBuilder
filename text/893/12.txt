Real Funding
Dear Andy,
Baa! There is supposed to be a
committee structure in ICU that exists to
ensure that w h e n a decision is made, it
reflects the views of the student populous.
Students at IC are represented by the
sabbaticals and elected representatives,
both social and academic. Yet these
people have so little to say at the
relevant meetings.
I write with particular reference to the
Council meeting of February 11 1991.
A n y o n e who attends one of these, and
any student is so entitled, will have
noticed that few people bother to take
part in important discussions.
For example, £4,000 was passed from
UFCs (University Funding Council) budget,
without a full U F C being called. The
Chairman (Benjamin Turner) is a member
of Council, but allowed this to happen.
Real Driving
There was a definite conflict of interests,
but the various representatives of the
populous appeared unconcerned. There
was more debate concerning a new
society forming, and then there was
about £4,000 being released for market
research, with the potential for a much
higher expenditure (from where?) should
the authorised company suggest it.
Although would this pass (!) through the
committee structure I am concerned that
thousands more could be 'rubber-stamped'
in a similar way.
It is disappointing that so few members
of Council (the Union's sovereign body)
queried the rush release of funds so that
the President could confirm his plans to
the company immediately after the
meeting.
R D Eyers, Publications Board Chair.
Dear Andy,
Let's get straight to the point, no
religion, no sex, just driving.
What is a Petromizer? We'll believe the
claims made w h e n we see them—and
look forward to hearing from Dr John
Speight.
In response to the cars and the
environment article in F E L I X 891 there
are a few points we would like to make,
but first one question.
1. W h o wants a Porsche anyway—all
Porsches sold today have catalytic
converters fitted as standard, you name
us one Real M a n who'd drive a car with a
cat—much better to buy a car without
one to avoid the boring job of cutting the
thing out of the exhaust and fitting a bit
of drain pipe in its place?
2. 120 kph? A r e you in town? If you
get bored at this speed take some advice
from a Real M a n and either a) drive
faster or b) throw the car sideways for
the sheer hell of it.
3. If one in four drivers are not
concentrating on driving may we
hypothesize that S H E is probably
adjusting her make-up in the rear view
mirror (what else could it possibly be for
girls?) Before y o u jump to the typewriter
to say that w o m e n have less accidents
than men—of course they don't and the
reason for this is blatantly obvious to all.
W o m e n don't drive as fast as men. It's a
sure bet that if they could they'd have a
lot more accidents.
4. Y o u might find it alarming to find
that a car is made every second but rest
assured that most of these will not be
Real Cars. For example a Fiesta is not a
Real Car, a Lancia Delta Integrate S4 is!
A Real Car must have:
a) A male driver
b) No catalytic converter
c) Run on leaded petrol
d) 4 wheel drive
e) A t least 250 bhp
A Real Car does not have enough room
for sex—if it does then the engine isn't
big enough. As for picking your nose may
we remind w o m e n drivers—two hands on
the steering wheel unless changing gear.
5. Electric vehicles! Are y o u joking?
By definition electric vehicles cannot be
exciting to drive. M a x i m u m torque at
zero revs make for a boring power curve.
Wheel spin becomes impossible. W e don't
want wheel spin to tear away from traffic
lights like boy-racers, it is merely a
necessity to soften the gear change from
first to second.
A s far as the environment goes (and
that's not far is it?) electric vehicles
simply shift the source of pollution from
the exhaust pipe to the chimney of the
power station.
6. The Lotus Carlton gives us the Horn.
176 mph. Where and why? Everywhere
and why not?
May we now pose our solutions to
Britain's motoring problems.
1. Ban all w o m e n from driving. This
will reduce the number of cars on the
roads by at least 5 0 % and emissions by a
similar amount.
2. Remove all speed limits and the
driver's liability for personal injury to
others. This will further reduce the
residual congestion—traffic speeds will
increase dramatically and the residual
pedestrians will be faster at crossing the
roads.
3. Issue all Real Men with Lotus
Carltons, preferably with a Nitro kit as
176 is a bit slow, oh and a cowcatcher
would be a bit useful.
Yours sideways,
Some Real Men.
