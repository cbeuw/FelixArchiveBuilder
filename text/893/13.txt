Real Opinion
Dear Andy,
At the risk of boring everyone to death,
I'd like to continue the great IC Abortion
Debate. So far we've heard from Pro-Life,
Christians, a prat and a Greek goddess.
As I fit none of these categories I hope to
offer an original point of view.
Abortion enthusiasts at Imperial appear
to agree on the need for a time limit, and
thankfully no one has yet advocated the
good old NUS stance of abortion on
demand up to birth. A t h e n a suggested
this limit should be 'the time at w h i c h the
baby can safely be removed and survive',
but this is arbitrary and impractical. It
depends on the health of the mother, on
the equipment available, on how many
nursing unions are on strike that week,
on lots of things. The only way to tell if a
baby will survive is to deliver it by
Caesarian section, hook it up to a mega-
expensive incubator, pump it full of
drugs, and wait and see. I doubt this
would be a satisfactory situation, either to
the mother who wants rid of the child, or
the taxpayer w h o is splashing out on
thousands of incubators. To avoid this
you could err o n the side of caution, and
set a lower limit at which the child
definitely couldn't survive, but I don't
think this w o u l d satisfy Athena.
The suggestion I favour is the one I
think Jason Pike was aiming at in F E L I X
888. If we could identify a t i m e ' t ' at
which life begins we could use that as
our limit. Before the
egg/foetus/embryo/child is just a blob,
and you can do what you want with it;
destroy it, experiment on it, play football
with it, the choice is entirely that of the
w o m a n concerned. But after t this sack of
chemicals, D N A and whathaveyou is by
definition alive, and must enjoy the
simple right not to be killed just because
it isn't wanted.
So it's off to the Biology Department to
define't'. W h e n does life begin? A t
fertilisation? A t implantation in the
womb? Or when the brain starts to
function in a particular way? Or not until
birth? Even later, when the child first
realises it is alive? Forty? Maybe Bishop
Berkely was right, and nobody is ever
alive because they are all just figments of
your imagination.
A r m e d only with a biology ' 0 ' Level, I
would tentatively suggest that life begins
at conception, for the usual reasons
(identifiable individual, unique D N A , etc).
If someone out there knows better, please
say.
As far as I can tell, abortion is the
killing of a human being, w h i c h certainly
shouldn't be encouraged. There are, of
course, times w h e n killing people is okay.
For instance, shooting an armed terrorist
or psychopath is usually a pretty wise
move. Killing a foetus is necessary if
continuing with the pregnancy will injure
the mother. But what of pregnancies
arising from rape or incest? A n d what
about pregnancies 'injurous to the mental
health of the mother'? I dare not pass
judgement on these cases, for fear of
provoking the wrath of A t h e n a and other
feminists; but I don't think it should be
solely up to the w o m a n involved whether
to kill her child. We are talking about
180,000 avoidable deaths a year: there
must be some national consensus on
when this is and isn't acceptable. I hope
that one day people will stop regarding
abortion as another means of family
planning, and will recognise it as a
specialised and rather gruesome form of
infanticide. Maybe then the social
pressures w h i c h today force w o m e n to
have abortions will be removed. If the
anguish and despair many pregnant
women suffer is replaced with concern
for the welfare of their child, that would
do more than any amount of legislation
to reduce the senseless slaughter this
country currently condones.
Yours,
Ultan McCarthy.

To whom ever it may concern.
I have had an abortion. Yes, I am the
scum of the earth who has killed another
human being.
This happened two years ago and I still
cry myself to sleep on a regular basis.
But what kind of life could I have given
my child in a shitty little bedsit
somewhere with no job and no money?
Now I am going to stir up all your self-
righteous, unforgiving Christians: would
God have given me the money I needed?
No, the government would and we all
know that it is not enough to bring up a
small baby properly.
The point of this letter is: I am fed up
with people writing into F E L I X shoving
their opinions down others' throats.
Everyone is entitled to their own
opinions, but you've had your say now.
Please let's stop this correspondence. It
hurts me and others like me. I do not
want to forget my child, but I don't want
to be reminded by narrow-minded idiots
who have no idea of the hell I went
through.
