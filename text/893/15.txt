E N Y I R O
The 'Greens' have been campaigning
since the early 1970s, but it was not until
the 1980s that the public at large became
environmentally aware. W i t h the
environmental society suddenly becoming
an inclusive, not an exclusive
organisation everyone w a s jumping on
the 'environmentally aware consumer'
bandwagon; organic food, l o w energy
lightbulbs, biodegradable bin liners. Roisin
Orosz of A r k points out that 'people read
and believe what they see at Sainsbury's,
whilst government publications are still
ignored.'
Instantly the press branded industry the
'bad guys'. Pressure groups inherited the
halo and were assumed righteous. It was
their role not to see ICI's point of view.
ICI justify their work as trying to increase
people's standard of living. Instantly we
have a clash between people w h o put the
environment first and people w h o put
people first. A s a journalist put it last
week; 'The Kurds or the Birds', when
referring to the help that has been
flooding in to rescue the wildlife in the
Gulf, when the victims of chemical
weapons were sadly neglected.

Clearly the planet can survive without
us. W e can't survive without the planet.
So what effect, if any, have the
environmental lobbyists h a d upon the
way industry operates?
B P admits that it has taken
environmental measurements which it
probably would not have taken so quickly
without pressure. 'What has changed is
the rate at which environmental
knowledge has spread'. B P are aware that
an offensive attitude towards green issues
is not conducive to raising equity. 'Such
issues should be tackled in a pro-active
way.'
Although apparently content for n o w to
keep Antarctica out of bounds B P admits
that elsewhere environmental costs have
also rendered areas unobtainable. 'The
cumulative effect of the environmental
lobby is enormous. 25-40% of the future
developments, (effectively 4-6.5 billion
barrels of oil), could be prevented n o w
because of environmental restrictions.'
The environmental movement have
finally achieved recognition within
industry a n d for the first time future
industrial objectives will only be achieved
by working together.
