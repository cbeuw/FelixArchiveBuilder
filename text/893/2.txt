Union Scuffle
In the early hours of Thursday morning a
scuffle erupted in the union bar. The
incident was serious enough for one of
the concerned parties to be appearing
before a union disciplinary hearing in the
near future.
According to a union source the
atmosphere at the end of Wednesday
evening had become rather fraught. The
bar staff were hassled by a clientele that
became increasingly difficult.
A spokesperson from the R S M U stated
that 'we were all out of there by 11pm'
and that they knew absolutely nothing
about the incident.
Paper Money
The newspaper of Kings College, Casey L,
is beleived to be suffering financial
difficulties. A King's College student told
Felix that the paper had used up all its
£6000 grant and hadn't managed to raise
the £4000 from advertising that it
expected to.
In response, Ms Turner, editor of Casey
L, said that £2000 was left over from a
£8000 grant, w h i c h would last at least
until the 24th A p r i l , when she said that
she would leave. She said that the paper
came out usually once every two weeks.
She added that they 'were doing
disastrously ' but were now doing fine.
Access Closed
Applications for the access fund are now
closed. The expected last minute flood
doubled the total number of applicants
from 220 on Thursday to 560 by 5pm on
Friday.
Mr Cullen, the person in charge of the
access fund , thanked Felix for helping to
publicise the fund's existence. Mr Cullen
felt that the most effective w a y of
communicating with students was through
Felix and that articles in Felix had
directly contributed to the last minute
surge in applications.
Mr Cullen said that he had 'made good
progress' with with the enormous pile of
applications. Successful applicants will
receive their money by the end of term.

Libyan Link
Imperial College has made a 'substantial'
offer for the thirteen year leasehold of
the ex-Libyan Embassy on Exhibition
Road. The college is now awaiting
planning permission to convert the
building for academic use.
Although the remaining leasehold is
comparatively short, the prime position of
the building has kept the value of the
leasehold high.
The University of London holds the
freehold and this has been a major
consideration in the decision to make an
offer. W h e n the thirteen year lease
expires, IC will probably be able to
extend it further.
What A Mug
A beer mug was thrown from Tizard Hall
on Monday night, narrowly missing a
local resident. A c c o r d i n g to J o h n Hassard,
Tizard's warden he could have been
killed had the glass hit him.
The student w h o threw the glass, who
didn't come from Tizard Hall, is due to
face a disciplinary hearing within the
next week. The most severe punishment
the student might suffer is expulsion from
college.
The resident called the police after the
incident and has written to Sir Eric A s h
and the mayor of Kensington and
Chelsea. Dr Hassard said that the incident
can only strain relations with the mews
residents which was poor at the best of
times. He said that it might threaten
planning permission for an extension to
the gym and he was also concerned
about damage to the overall reputation of
the college.
Theft Corner
Computers worth £3500 were stolen from
the Huxley building this week. The room
in which they were kept was well
secured except for a bit w h i c h could only
have been k n o w n about by somebody
knowing the r o o m well. The security
problem has now been solved.
Some vending machines have been
broken into, the amounts taken being 'not
worth the bother' according to Geoff
Reeves, IC's chief security officer. He
suspects that people sleeping rough or
hard up have been responsible and added
that there had been more thefts from cars
in the last three months than in the last
three years.
A Jaguar car parked behind the
Chemistry building had its w i n g mirrors
ripped off this week. Security officers said
that this was probably due to 'kids taking
it out on a car or two.'
