Editorial
Exams and other Problems
Once more our n o n - s a b b a t i c a l editor is
swept under the rising tide of his
departmental exams. So, the task of
producing this anorexic Felix (and rant)
falls to the lesser minions k n o w n as the
student staff. W e are not a closed shop.
W e want as many people as possible to
join us. So whether you are a new Or old
member of this esteemed college, come
along and help out.
Lies, Damned Lies and Market
Research
Consider a point raised by the letter 'Real
Funding', concerning the way the Union
handles financial matters. Now, this is
your money and yet most of you show
no concern as to how it is spent. Believe
it or not the Union actually consists of
the 5000 or so students that make up IC,
and it does not exist to give a few dozen
hacks something to do in their spare
time. The only way things can get any
better is if Y O U get involved (all of you).
Students and Normal People
Once again it appears that some people
want the College to become Imperial
College Pic. O n e of the main functions of
Universities is to educate not only
students, but also the general public.
Some administrators are trying to restrict
public access to open lectures in College.
Further divorce from the real world
serves no one but the pen-pushers.
News Meeting 3.00pm Wednesday
All who are interested in this vital area of
Felix welcome. Free Coffee (and milk and
suger, if required).
