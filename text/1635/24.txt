T
here is a lot to be stressed
out about at exam time.
Whether it is your first
year or your last, it is
difficult to balance the intense
workload with other commitments,
such as arranging accommodation
for next year. First and foremost,
if you feel you are struggling to
cope, whether you have pre-existing
health conditions or not, the most
important thing to do is consult a
medical professional. If feelings
of anxiety are disrupting your life,
speak to your GP – a quarter of
all GP appointments are regarding
mental health, so a good GP should
not have problems with leading the
conversation.
The next step is to speak to
somebody at the university. If you
do not feel comfortable speaking to
your hall warden or personal tutor,
the counselling service is great to contact, and won’t share anything
with your department without
your consent. If you do choose to
disclose any information, they are a
good go-to for negotiating deadline
extensions and exam arrangements,
and will be able to point you
towards a designated staff member
in your department. For example,
with evidence of medical issues
you may be able to arrange separate
accommodation for exams, or rest
breaks if you need them. However,
it is important to note these

arrangements may have deadlines.
There are also things you can
do to help yourself cope. If you’re
struggling socially, remember that
you are not obligated to attend
anything if you don’t feel like
you have enough time, but it is
important to strike a balance so that
you don’t end up isolating yourself.
If you are feeling like a lack
of social interaction is affecting
you in a bad way, make an effort
to integrate some group work
into your revision plan. It may be
refreshing to mix it up if you’ve been
staring at your problem sheets alone
in the library. If stress is affecting
your day-to-day functions, try to
pinpoint specific struggles you may
have. For example, if you struggle
with preparing meals try cooking in
batches when you feel more up to
it, or arranging joint mealtimes with
flatmates.
Self-care should always be a
priority. Get a bit of exercise. If
you can’t afford an hours’ gym
session, consider getting off the
tube a few stops early and walking
for ten minutes. Celebrate the little
achievements, and do not judge
yourself if a nap in the middle of the
day or an overpriced hot chocolate
