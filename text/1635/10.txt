L
arge shoals of fish attract
a range of predators
including multiple species
of whale. A recent study
though, found that although many
species might be feasting on herring
at the same time, whales tend to
stick with their own kind when
preying. By mapping different
whale calls, research found evidence
of clear whale groupings within
dense herring shoals: humpback
whales clustered at either end of
the spawning grounds, while mink,
fin and blue whales set up feeding
territories between them. Passive
ocean acoustic wave guide remote
sensing showed that calls increase
dramatically at night time, when
extremely dense shoals form and
dissipated during the day when
herring scattered throughout the
seafloor. However, further research
must be carried out to discover
whether there is territorialism
occurring or if they are selecting
these locations based on their
different foraging mechanisms.
A
t Sh!t Sc!ence we like to
defend the lil’science,the
science that gets bullied,
the science that gets
wedgies from the bigger sciences
when it tries to speak up,because we
believe that every science, no matter
how puny, has value and should be
respected. This week: archaeology.
Need I say more?
Yes, archaeology, or the discovery
of things that happened literally
thousands of years ago. Going to
an archaeology conference is like
watching an episode of Sherlock,
“This fragment of a piece of bone
was positioned two centimetres
East of the remains of a fire pit
which is evidenced by these three
flecks of carbon matter. Therefore,
Australopithecus tried to kill Homo
erectus!” Elementary, until another
archaeologist finds another tiny
fragment of bone on the other side
of the planet, and the entire field is
shaken to its core. It is a strenuous,
arduous,ridiculous nerd of a science;

us, but maybe they just never stopped eating. Photo Credit: Mike Mozart

Sh!t Sc!ence
Angry old man vindicated: Food was better back in the day
but it is not useless, because looking
into the past gives us a better grasp
of what is coming in our future.
That is the case of a new study
published in Clinical Anatomy this
week. Sometimes all that is left of
a time period is human remains,
so archaeologists have learned
to read anatomical clues to the
conditions in which people were
living. One such clue is a condition
called cribra orbitalia (CO), where
the bone inside the eye socket
becomes porous. This condition
is generally accepted to be a tell-
tale sign of anaemia due to iron
deficiency, periods of malnutrition
or infection. If archaeologists find
a high prevalence of CO in the
population, they take it as a sign
that these poor people had a rather
rough time of it. “But there’s been
a lot of debate about the prevalence
of CO in modern populations,
with some saying it had effectively
disappeared,” says Ann Ross, co-
author of the study. The scientists
compared 245 prehistoric,
381 historic (pre-20th
century)
and 218 modern skeletons.
Surprisingly, the researchers
found that not only was CO
not extinct, it was relatively
common, with 12.35 percent
of modern North Americans
and 16.8 percent of modern
South Africans displaying it.
Even more surprisingly, this
is a higher prevalence than in
their historic counterparts. “We
think the increased prevalence
of CO in the modern skulls may
be due to intestinal parasites in
some populations and iron-
poor diet”, Ross says.
Therefore, like many a time
before, knowledge of prehistory
sheds light on modern culture.
These findings, Ross says,
show that “disadvantaged
socioeconomic groups, and
parts of the developing world,
are still struggling with access
to adequate nutrition.”
