Don’t get caught out!
If it looks suspicious then it could be a trap. Be on your
guard against scam emails, texts and online adverts.
What to do:
• Consider whether email requests online are genuine
• If in doubt, don’t click on links or attachments
• Be careful when sharing personal information
It’s everyone’s responsibility to be secure.
