Back to Basics: Scones and Tea
FELIX visits The Muffin Man Tea Shop for afternoon tea.
I
f you had to pick one dish that
represents Britain, what would
it be? Mine would definitely
be the traditional English
afternoon tea. Probably the same as
any typical Chinese girl.
Do not let the idea of afternoon
tea scare you – this is going to be
a casual affair, no extravagance,
no posh British accents, no jaw-
dropping bills. I promise.
The Muffin Man Tea Shop is
situated down the quiet Wrights
Lane, just around the corner
from High Street Kensington
underground station. Small, old-
fashioned, dimly lit, with black and
white photos on the walls, a counter
with a Victoria sponge, shortbread
and many other sweet delights.
Imagine visiting your grandmother.
I always come here for the Devon
Cream Tea. Two scones served with
clotted cream, strawberry jam and a
pot of tea of your choice. And yes,
a delicate, white china teacup on a
saucer. How much more British can
one get?
Don’t expect the tea to be any
different from your usual Tetley, or
the jam to be superior to that 75p
jar from Tesco. It is not about the
tea, or the jam. It’s all about the
scones.
Yes, the scones. You are about to
taste the best scones in the whole of
London.
At this stage I wouldn’t argue
about whether the jam goes first, or
the cream. It doesn’t matter. We can
argue about etiquette or viscosity
or aesthetics later. Just shut up,
smother it with any ratio of cream
to jam, and eat.
The scones are hot and toasted,
with a slightly dry crunch on the
edges yet retaining this wonderful
moisture and softness inside. The
hint of buttery flavours merges
perfectly with the smooth clotted
cream and jam.
In case you are still feeling a bit
peckish, have a look at their equally
British menu – Coronation chicken
salad or a rarebit?
Scones and tea. The perfect
occasion on a sunny afternoon to sit,
relax, and of course, to feel perfectly
British.
On a final note: clotted cream
goes first.
The challenge used to be how much jam you could fit on. Clearly, times have changed. Photo Credit: Christy Lam
Do not let
afternoon
tea scare
you
Scones with fresh butter,
and quick “jam”
A
s Christy says – what
could be more classically
English than scones
(tea, the queen and
institutionalised pig-fucking didn’t
make the cut)? Personally, I always
associate scones with my slightly
frazzled mother hurriedly making a
batch of them – either for her stitch
‘n’ bitch (the so called “wimmins
group”), book group or the
unexpected arrival of a guest! Still,
they were always delicious – and in
our house, it was always real butter
(a treat from the usual margarine)
with jam, though clotted cream was
occasionally proffered.
All three components – the hot,
crisp scones, rich butter and sweet
jam – are actually quite simple to
make,and keep well.So,if you fancy
making some on for a Sunday picnic
in the park, don’t worry – they can
all be made on the Saturday before,
and kept. Take some rose cava, a
comfy blanket, and a condom.
The scone recipe is my mother’s
– and it’s a pretty traditional
one, though some plebs insist
that currants (or “raisins” – never
sultanas) do not belong in scones.
They are wrong.
If you haven’t had fresh butter
before, this really is a huge treat
– it’s so different from the highly
processed cheap Lurpak that many
of you might be familiar with.Make
sure to buy real cream, and not
Elmlea – it’s a cream substitute and
will not work!
For the “jam”, don’t be as picky
with fruit, as it will work well
with anything from strawberries,
raspberries and redcurrants, with
the first two starting to come into
season now. The appropriate term
for it would really be a compote, as
it won’t fully set.
Scones:
250g self-raising flour
1 rounded tsp baking powder
30g caster sugar
40g softened butter
75g currants
1 egg
100ml milk
Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.
Mix all the dry ingredients apart
from the currants together,and chop
in the butter. Crumble together
with your hands – a food processor
does this very quickly but is also a
bugger to clean.
Add the currants, and mix in
evenly.Whisk the egg with the milk,
and incorporate into the mixture –
you may need a touch more milk.
The mixture should be quite dry.
Roll out the mixture to ~2cm
thick,and use a water glass (or fluted
ring cutter) to cut out scones. I do
mine about 6cm across. Re-roll the
scraps, and repeat – there’s always
one dodgy looking one at the end.
Place on a floured baking tray, and
place in the oven for 8-10 minutes
until risen and golden brown.
Butter
300ml double cream
Flake salt
Pour the cream into a jar,and screw
the lid on tight.Shake like crazy! It’s
very good forearm exercise, though
most of you should have no problem
with that.After 5-10 minutes,you’ll
see golden flakes appear that will
eventually accumulate into a nice
clump of butter.
Put into a sieve to drain briefly
(the liquid is buttermilk, which can
be used for baking) and then in the
fridge to set. Once slightly firmer,
sprinkle with the salt
Compote
250g soft fruit – whatever is in
season, see above – with stems
removed, sliced.
Squeeze of lemon juice
Sugar, to taste
Simply add the fruit and lemon
juice to a pot and simmer gently on
the stove until they break down.This
shouldn’t take too long. Add sugar
to taste, stirring to dissolve, and
leave on the heat, stirring regularly,
until it thickens a touch. Pour into a
small, clean jar, and refrigerate.

Go-nuts for doughnuts
FELIX presents your guide to the best doughnuts in London
T
hrowback to the seven
years spent in an all-girls
boarding school in the
countryside. A weekend
trip to the nearest town with an
actual supermarket was a sacred
privilege only to those of Year 9 and
above, while you have to be at least
in Year 12 to be allowed to step on
the train on the opposite platform
to London.
Strict rules applied: we had to
fill in a so-called “exeat form” days
prior to departure,then get it signed
on time by the Housemistress. We
checked out, left school on Saturday
noon,came back no later than 17:00
on the dot to check back in and our
bags search for alcohol or cigarettes.
Trips on Sundays were considered as
“special cases”requiring a legitimate
reason for the need to do so.By Year
13, this procedure felt rather like
inmates applying for furlough.
Another precious memory
of those innocent days is an
unbelievable infatuation with Krispy
Kremes. Back then, they were a rare
commodity, highly sought after
especially by the younger years, and
only available during the occasional
charity fundraising. Long queues
formed outside the English
classroom with crowd control. 20
dozen Original Glaze sold out
faster than the blink of an eye.
I too, lived in the craze, jotting
down its planned trade date as soon
as it was made known to the public
after prayers on Monday mornings.
Even made up the most ridiculous
excuses to nip out from class five
minutes early to beat the queue.
And now, in 2016, after two
odd years in civilisation will I still
be that obsessed with them as my
13-year-old self? Of course not.
One look at that poor girl
fundraising for charity holding
that familiar green-dotted-on-
white box approaching me from 30
metres away would have me turning
immediately on my heels and
dashing off in the exact opposite
direction. An unexpected approach
would be dealt with with a good ten
second hesitation, with my mind
entirely blanked out and extreme
tension building up inside similar to
answering the winning question in
Who Wants to be a Millionaire: a)
accept the doughnut, b) decline the
doughnut, c) pretend you are deaf
and blind, d) run.
Most of the time I’d kindly decline
the sugared ring while offering
to donate the exact price. Plonk
as the coin hits the bottom of the
plastic bucket.The reason behind
the disappearance of love for Krispy
Kremes? Because there are far, far
better doughnuts in this world.
1.The Classic
The joy of biting into a doughnut
completely and symmetrically filled
to the top with perfectly smooth
vanilla custard cream. The days
of disappointment from stingy
fillings are forever gone with St
John’s Bakery and Bread Ahead
Bakery. Both are excellent local
bakeries producing all sorts of
top-notch baked goods everyday
including a wide variety of pastries
and sourdough. Doughnuts are
their popular specialty with some
basic flavours in common: vanilla
custard, honeycomb, raspberry jam,
chocolate.
Bread Ahead explores slightly
further with flavours depending
on the season, such as blackberry
custard ripple, salted caramel with
honeycomb and my favourite –
earl grey with soaked prune (all
£2.50). The doughnut itself is like
a brioche and is dusted with white
sugar. St John’s Bakery is available
from their bakeries in Druid Street
Market, Maltby Street Market,
Spitalfields and the Food Hall at
Selfridges. Bread Ahead opens their
store at Borough Market and Old
Spitalfields Market on select days.
2.The Sourdough
Probably should have called this
category “Gourmet” – Crosstown
Doughnuts boasts of their hand
made, hybrid sourdough base
claiming to reduce the sweetness
and to not absorb as much fat when
deep fried. Their layers of icing on
top definitely helped a great deal too.
In reality, they have a slightly firmer
and chewier texture compared to
the conventional doughnut. Their
range of unique and unimaginable
flavours is the selling point: granola
and strawberry jam, PB&J, sea
salt caramel banana (£3 - £3.50).
Find them in their flagship store in
Soho, their little black van at Old
Spitalfields Market, WholeFoods,
Selfridges and various independent
cafes across London.
3.The Cronut
All hail Dominique Ansel – the
creator of the Cronut™. The chef
and owner of Dominique Ansel
Bakery in New York – the patisserie
whose creations took the world by
storm. Expect to join the queue at
6am, two hours before the shop
opens. Lucky for us, three bakeries
have come up with something
along the same lines as the real
deal. Dum Dum Donutterie in Box
Park Shoreditch and Brick Lane
presents their iconic Cro in Zebra
(chocolate),strawberry & cream and
Cronutella. Distinct layers of pastry
filled with buttercream, toppings
and dunked in sugar (£3).The range
is also available at Harrods (£4.50).
Meanwhile Rinkoff Bakery,
the 105-year-old family run
business in Whitechapel, has their
popular Crodough with a lot less
buttercream and sugar compared
to the former in a wider variety of
flavours. Think Oreo Cheesecake,
PB&J and S’mores, and a special
Crème Egg Crodough during
Easter (all £2.50). If Whitechapel
is too far a journey, find them at
Selfridges and Timberyard.
Last but not least – Cocomaya in
Marble Arch presents their elegant
take in their CocoDough available
in salted caramel, Red Velvet,
strawberry, chocolate and vanilla
(all £3.25).
4.The Duffin
If a doughnut and a muffin had
a child, what would it be called?
A Duffin.No joke. This doughnut-
muffin hybrid was invented by Beas
of Bloomsbury in 2013 and created
a huge fuss back then, including
controversywithStarbucksoverwho
actually created this Frankenstein in
the first place.
Enough of law suits. Beas still
have their Duffin game going strong
selling in their cafes at Bloomsbury,
St Paul’s and Farringdon. It is
essentially a dense buttermilk cake
the size of your palm, flavoured
with nutmeg, dipped in butter,
rolled in sugar then piped with jam
or Nutella (£2.50).
5.The Cruffin
On the subject of portmanteau
pastries, allow me to introduce
you to the Cruffin. Originating
from Mr Holms Bakehouse in San
Francisco, the croissant pastry is
baked in a muffin mould instead
of its usual lunar shape, then filled
with custard to the brim, dusted
with sugar and there you have it –
the Cruffin. Cocomaya in Marble
Arch does a breath-taking version
in chocolate, strawberry, caramel
cheesecake and blueberry. The
custard cream is smooth and light
yet rich in flavour. The delicate
layers of pastry maintained a
perfect balance of crispiness and
moisture – imagine the freshly
heated up pastries at the Library
Café in the morning.Their café has
a limited supply of them everyday,
but Selfridges always has a not-so-
secret stash in the Food Hall.
