L
ast week, HRH Princess
Chulabhorn of Thailand
visited Imperial to discuss
science and collaboration
with students and professors. The
princess, who is the youngest child
of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, met
Thai students as well as experts
in her field of interest: medical
research.
Princess Chulabhorn is well
known for her keen interest in
science and medicine. She has a
PhD in Chemistry from Mahidol
University, Bangkok.
She spoke about future
collaborations between Imperial and
Thailand, her own research and the
importance of research in general,
calling it “the key to everything”.
The princess met professors from
the medical faculty’s surgery and
cancer department, the School of
Public Health and Electronical
Engineering.

“Imperial College London is very
proud of our links with Thailand
both through students and the
research that we do together. Today
is a chance to celebrate that and
to discuss ways we can work more
closely together”.

Brexit would be detrimental to UK

The heavy reminder comes after
weeks of to-and-fro between the
‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ camps, headed
up by Boris Johnson and David
Cameron respectively. In the last
week, Boris has been criticised for
saying the EU has the same aims
that Hitler did, and Cameron has
been accused of using the threat
of war to frighten voters into
remaining.
Remain posters have been spotted
around college in recent weeks, and

Tuition fees will rise with inflation
The government’s white paper on higher education is out and it’s official, fees won’t
stay at nine grand
T
he government has
released a white paper
this week outlining its
future plans for higher
education, most notably allowing
universities to charge more than
£9000 per year in tuition fees.
These plans come just four years
after the trebling of tuition fees by
the coalition government (and the
ensuing protests) and would mean
that the top performing universities
could increase their fees year on
year in line with inflation. This is a
category that Imperial would likely
fall into, with the changes coming
into effect by autumn of 2017.
The proposals mean,at the current
rate of 1.6% inflation (RPI), that
students would pay an extra £144 a
year on top of your £9000. Granted,
this is not massive in the grand
scheme of things,but just as recently
as 2011, inflation in the UK was
5%, equating to £450 a year, sizable
when you’re on a 3/4/5+ year course.
Conmen drove the student to a cash point after meeting him outside Fisher
O
n Wednesday, a
student was conned
into handing over cash
to fraudsters outside
Fisher Hall in Evelyn Gardens.
Two men in a car, thought to be
Italian, stopped the student outside
the halls of residence and asked him
for directions to the airport.
They got chatting, and persuaded
the student that they were fashion
designers with leather jackets to
give away. The fraudsters told the
student that they “didn’t want to pay
tax” on the garments, and that he
could have them for free.
The men then somehow persuaded
the student that they were in need of
cash to buy their children souvenirs.
The student got into their car, a
white Audi, and they drove him to
a cash machine.
An attempt at the same con
occurred outside Beit yesterday
too, leading police to believe the
fraudsters are particularly targeting
Imperial students. It’s thought that
these con artists may be specivfically
targeting international students.
The warning from college is
to immediately report to college
security or wardening staff if you’re

Imperial College President, Alice
Gast, spoke out against the green
paper that proposed this idea and
several other initiatives, saying
that it is important to “voice our
concerns when we think that a
proposed framework will inhibit or
discourage excellence rather than
support and reward it”. The NUS
have also come out as staunch critics
of the paper.
It’s been argued by some that

the policy itself, the Teaching
Excellence Framework, is the first
step on a slippery slope in which
tuition fees for the top universities
could rise and rise at will.This could
eventually lead to an economic class
system between universities.
The green and subsequent white
papers are the brainchild of Jo
Johnson, Boris’s younger brother
and the current Minister of State
for Universities and Science. Jo,
who attended Oxford University
and studied Modern History, came
under fire earlier this month too,
after he oversaw the renaming of
the new Boaty McBoatface polar
research ship to RSS Sir David
Attenborough.

These plans
come just
four years
after the
trebling of
tuition fees
approached by anyone in this way.
Students are advised not to attempt
to challenge or speak to them,
however tempting, and instead walk
away. Obviously don’t get in their
car, which may not still be an Audi.
