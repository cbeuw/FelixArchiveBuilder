Documentary corner: A Riot of our Own

N
o Nazis. No dark metal.
Live acts 7 days a week.
These simple admission
criteria meant that gigs
could be booked in the same day,
regardless of band size or experience,
to play in front of the music-loving
crowd who religiously converged
on the 12 Bar Club, hidden in
Denmark Street.
What made the place unique was
the openness of the punters who,
for one reason or another, ended
up side by side at the narrow bar
counter: from the regulars who
had been popping in for the last 20
years, to randomers who happened
to stumble there on the way home
from Soho, you could not help but
feel a sense of community every
time you stopped by.
Everyone belonged in there as
long as they were not too keen on
NationalSocialismortheHolocaust.
Not many places managed to bring
together city suits and spiky leather
jackets in an eclectic mosh-pit hug.
Where else could you be smoking a
cigarette and drinking Jack whilst
simultaneously watching some
gimp-mask-wearing guy play pool?
You could literally buy a guitar, start
a band, rehearse in a studio, play
your first gig, get a tattoo, and fall in
love,all in the same night at this Tin
Pan Alley watering hole.
For years, the 12 Bar Club stood
proud as the most (only?) genuine,
trip-worthy, night-rescuing,
reliable venue of central London. It
launched plenty of famous musical
careers and saw the last breath of
many more. It’s an institution to
which London owes its status of
musical capital of Europe.
And now it’s all gone. Poof.
Vanished. Just like that.
The film A Riot of our Own,
from director Tali Clarke, takes
us through the big side-effects of
the current Disneyland-ification
of London. Under the excuse of
redevelopment and better transport
connections,developers are building
empty fairy-tale castles in the sky,
house-of-card-shaped tax-havens,
and ubiquitous gift shops with as
much genuine feeling as a Hard
Rock Cafe or a Starbucks. This
bittersweet documentary takes us
through the last days of London’s
best live music institution and –
whether you had been a regular, a
one-timer, or a 12 Bar virgin – it
will definitely leave you with both a
sense of nostalgia for what it meant
and regret for the inevitable march
of the speculative housing market.
But there is hope: the 12 Bar Club
lives on, now somewhere in zone 2,
showing you can destroy the venue,
you can push people away, but you
will never be able to put out the
ever-burning fire of uniqueness and
authenticity because,to put it simply,
not everyone wants to be bought.
As Pablo Neruda put it: ‘They may
mow down all the flowers, but they
can't stop spring’.
