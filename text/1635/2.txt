O
h hey! Didn’t see you
there. Welcome to this
your fifth-to-last issue
of FELIX for this
academic year. No, I’m not counting
them down. I just want to put a
suitable amount of pressure on you
to get involved.
Never written for us? That doesn’t
matter.All you need to do is send an
email to one of the section editors,
either pitching an idea for an article
or if you’ve written something
already, the piece itself. It’s that
easy! We accept procrasti-pitches
and feelings-heavy comment pieces
that you will regret having written
in your thirties.
I am biased, but getting involved
in the paper is great. Nothing beats
the feeling of seeing your name in
print, correctly spelled. Even if it is
spelled wrong, you still feel pretty
nice. We’re a friendly bunch, with
a nice big office in the basement
of Beit, with Macs and hot-takes
galore. So write a couple of pieces,
see if you like it, and then think
about joining our team of editors
next year.

The first time I wrote for the
paper was in the TV section. Like
many media-leaning millennials,
my instant reaction to particularly
visceral content (Beyoncé’s
Lemonade, Katie Hopkins) is a
think piece. So I sent something
into FELIX, and then accidentally
became the music editor. That was
a laugh, so I thought I’d give being
the full-time editor a try. You guys
agreed, so I did this for year. This
was slightly more serious, but still
mainly a laugh. Regardless of your
ambitions in a career sense, I urge
you to use the fact that Imperial
has a student newspaper to improve
your writing skills. We have editors
here to help and guide you. Every
job has an application form, and the
only way to improve your written
communication is to practise. I
sound like your mum, I know. She
says hi, by the way.
This week, it’s exam season, so
we’re focussing on the things that are
probably concerning you right now:
focus-enhancing study drugs and
the desperately high temperatures
in the library.

Many newspapers have had their
own causes they’ve passionately
campaigned for. The Daily Mail
can count the plastic bag ban as
one of its successes. The Guardian
has Snowdon. And I hope that
one day, the Editor of FELIX can
say "We helped the library get air
conditioning".
I urge you to sign our petition to
get air con installed,and if you insist
on taking non-prescribed Modafinil,
to be careful when crossing roads.
I
n Issue 1622, dated the 15th
January 2016, the editorial
discussed a story concerning
former Imperial academic,
Dr Bernard Lamb. In this editorial,
Dr Lamb was described as a bigot,
which FELIX accepts was an
offensive and unnecessary word
to use, and also suggested that Dr
Lamb disapproved of people of
mixed ethnic heritage, which is
incorrect. Therefore, FELIX would
like to offer an apology to Dr Lamb
for the accusation of bigotry. In
fact, Dr Lamb has supervised and
worked alongside international
students throughout his career, and
has enjoyed decades of friendship
with students of many nationalities
and ethnicities.
As Editor of FELIX, I retract
these comments and apologise to
Dr Lamb for the offense we have
caused him.
An apology to Dr Bernard Lamb
