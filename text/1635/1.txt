aeronautics students
were given free tickets
to a will.i.am gig at the
Royal Albert Hall gig last week,
after being spotted in their boiler
suits taking an end of year picture
outside the venue earlier that day.
Apparently impressed by the
group’s aesthetic, the concert’s
Email said "it is not our role to tell people how to
vote" but mentioned pro-EU position
director approached and offered the
students 20 free tickets to the sold
out gig if they turned up that night
in their boiler suits.He attempted to
lure the young aeronautics students

President, Alice Gast,
and Provost, James
Stirling,sent an email to
all staff and students, encouraging

described how Imperial had
“contributed to collective efforts in
the higher education community

on research and education” and
mentioned the pro-EU open letter

not our role to tell people how to

Imperial’s part in producing pro-EU

and affect different individuals,
companies and institutions in
different ways”. So, vote how you
want, we guess.
The email's subject line was
"Message to the Community on the
EU Referendum".
The Education Act of 1986 only
enforces a “balanced presentation
of political views” within a school
environment. There is no such
rule at universities. Imperial’s own
communications and Freedom of
Speech policies also allow this –
Professor Gast seems to be well
within her rights to have emailed
students and staff encouraging them
to vote a certain way.
Imperial’s own students for

“While we applaud Professor Gast
for encouraging staff and students
to vote, we disagree..."

greeted with canapes and Prosecco.
They were interviewed by the
director before the gig, which was

They then saw the show from the
arena, right next to the stage. A
couple of them...
