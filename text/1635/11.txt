Future of the Left have generated
a reputation for absurd lyrics,

clear that FotL were relishing from
the freedom to create the songs and
music they wanted to rather than
catering to the demands of a third
party. The fact that artistic freedom
led to the creation of one of FotL’s
most tense and restrained albums
was really surprising as there was a
clear move towards minimal songs
punctuated with staccato riffing,
removing some of the more ‘fun’
elements of their sound.
It’s welcome then that The Peace…
showcases a more multi-faceted
approach. Whilst the jarring
staccato riffing songs are still
present, they are used as occasional
spiteful moments rather than the
main body of this album. This has
allowed room for some really bass
heavy songs and reintroduction of
the some more playful elements that
FotL used so well in their earlier
efforts. This variation in approaches
makes The Peace... a significantly
easier listen than How to... and
adds impact to both.The bass heavy
songs feel heavier, the stuttering
dead-stop guitar led songs, such as
‘Miners Gruel’, more visceral, and
the catchy moments more hooky.
The increased amount of really
bassy songs has to be attributed
to bassist Julia Ruzicka. Her
inventive, thick bass lines have
been increasingly become a part
of FotL’s sound. Songs such as the
nasty ‘If AT&T Drank Tea What
Would BP Do?’ to the groovy ‘The
Limits of Battleships’ are led by her
wonderfully dirty overdriven bass
lines and mark a real development
from the more passive role the bass
has served in previous albums. This
adds an extra dimension to FotL’s
sound giving them a much thicker
sound, taking the lead away from

the sporadic guitar lines that have
been the focal point in the past.
It’s reassuring that it is not
all change for this album with
a predictably excellent vocal
performance from Andrew “Falco”
Falkous. This varied performance
sets FotL apart from their followers
and imitators. With so many other
bands taking a one track approach
on their vocal lines, the depth and
breadth of Falco’s weird singing
voices which are essentially used
as a second melodic instrument
are always suprising. From the
whimsical singing on ‘Miner’s
Gruel’, to the desperate nasally
screams at the end of the furious

In the music streaming wars we all lose

A
nother week and yet
another timed exclusive
on a streaming service.
This time it’s Chancethe
Rapper’s Coloring Book, exclusive to
Apple Music for two weeks.
I’m growing fucking tired of this
shit. It’s not like streaming services
are actually distinguishable in
functionality in any meaningful way.
The overlap in content between the
main services (Google Play Music,
Apple Music, Spotify and TIDAL)
is so massive that the only incentive
these companies can come up for
consumers to switch to their services
is to provide exclusive albums and in
most cases this exclusivity is only for
a limited time.
Compare this to video streaming
services, where each provider offers
drastically different content, or
video game consoles, where systems
vary in power and there are frequent
console-exclusive titles, and it’s
obvious that we’re being played.
It’s hard to blame the musicians
who have stakes in TIDAL –
they’re trying to make money in a
precarious music industry. But in
many cases when they make things
exclusive, rather than getting new
customers to join their service
they’re forcing consumers back to
illegally download albums again
(which streaming services were
created to prevent). No one is
going to subscribe to every music
service just to listen to every album
that’s released; they’re going to
complement their music streaming
with pirating.
If you by into all that capitalism
bullshit then I guess competition
can sometimes be great.
Maybe this model of exclusivity
is working for companies, but
it’s certainly not working for
consumers. Welcome to the world
of virtually identical streaming
platforms, where the crossover of
content is probably higher than
90%, and where as a result we all
lose out. Some musicians are now
more businessperson than artist.Art
should be for everyone, not for the
few who are silly enough to pay for
three streaming subscriptions.
clean singing on ‘No Son Will
Ease their Solitude’, Falco’s vocals
provide wonderful hooks – hooks
that are especially welcome on the
more alienating tracks on the album.
Altogether The Peace and Truce of
Future of the Left is probably one of
FotL’s most accessible and varied
releases, combining the elements
that make them so interesting and
rewarding to listen to from their
previous albums with new twists
and quirks creating a really deep
rewarding album.
