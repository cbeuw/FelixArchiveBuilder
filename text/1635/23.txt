This week you get invited to
a will.i.am gig because you
happened to be outside the
Royal Albert Hall in a boiler
suit. However, once you
get inside you realise you're
trapped forever in will.i.am's
freak army of backing
dancers, people who actually
own wearable tech and
runners up from The Voice.

This week you're the
Imperial President and you
accidentally send an email
to the entire student and
staff bodies, saying: "please
unsubscribe me from this
list". Unfortunately, everyone
interprets this as a pro-Brexit
move and you are hastily
ousted from the college's
inner circle.
This week, you're the child
of a minor royal, walking the
halls of Imperial doing your
degree, whilst the rest of the
student body studies on in
ignorance. But we know who
you're there.Send us an email
– it's at the top of the page.
This week you decide to
smuggle yourself out of the
country so you don’t have to
do any more exams,by hiding
yourself in a large rucksack;
however, you are left in the
middle of Heathrow airport
and they destroy you in a
controlled explosion.
This week David Cameron
calls you "divisive, stupid and
wrong". Bit harsh, I mean all
you did was fail a few exams
here and there.Plus there was
that one geophysics paper
where you got the model
answers and almost scraped
a 2:1.
This week you are pretty sick
of your spanish girlfriend at
the moment so as revenge
you decide you are going to
vote for Brexit so it’s harder
for her to come back after
summer. Love you really.
This week you decide to go
on holiday after your exams
with people from halls but
leave it up to your Korean
friend to decide where you
go. Turns out he’s from the
North and you end up in a
slave labour camp where you
can’t even access Panopto.
This week you read that
eating potatoes four times
a week increases your risk
of death but you don’t care.
If you have die to due from
potatoes so be it. It will be a
glorious death.
This week you seem to be
disappointed about DJ Fresh
headlining summer ball but
that’s because you’re a fresher
that doesn’t understand that
the summer ball headliner is
always shit. I heard Professor
Green hit a guy.
This week in a bid to become
chair at your club’s AGM
you try to assassinate your
competition by slashing his
bike cables; however, they
also do the same to you and
you’re both RON’ed whilst in
hospital.
This week you finally sign a
contract to the perfect place
that's near college and not
too pricy; however, after
signing it you realise that you
now have to look after the
sex dungeon in the basement
which involves a lot of
mopping up fluid.
This week, you're a keen
fraudster looking to con
some students. So you
set up a higher education
system that treats young
people as customers,
puts off the poorest and
actively encourages the best
universities to only accept
those who can pay the most.

10 MINUTES INTO BREXIT AND CHILL AND

BUT YOU'VE GOTTO WEAR IT ANYWAY
