In response to Issue 1633
Centrefold (netball)
Dear FELIX
I attended the Imperial College
Festival last weekend. I was inspired
and captivated by the enormous
range of research and innovation
that I was able to discuss in detail
with students, researchers and
professors who were all passionate
about what they were doing and
keen to share their thinking. What
a privilege!
Whilst there I picked up FELIX
(Issue 1633); the centre-fold made
me gasp in horror and then brought
me close to tears. I was a student
in Electrical Engineering from
1977-80. At that time there were
5% women across Imperial College,
with fewer in engineering. As
Hon Sec and then President of
C&G Union, I worked in every
way possible to help retain current
female students and attract new
female students. In this context,
C&GU actively challenged all
sexist representation of women
and activities and “traditions” that
degraded women. IC Union also
made its voice heard on many issues
of national policy and practice that
discriminated against women.
I presume the IC netball team
chose to attract teams for their
tournament in this way but I ask
them why they would want to
present their bodies rather than
their netballing skills. And why
would FELIX want to encourage
them in this? I ask you all to think
about the message you are giving to
female peers who doubtless rebuff
unwanted sexual comment and
harassment daily; the message you
are giving to male peers who are
again being invited to look at women
as objects for their gratification; the
contribution you are making to
the pressures on young women to
compete through their looks rather
than their achievements.
It was noticeable that, amongst
all the wonderful IC people I spoke
to, women were extremely under-
represented. It was also noticeable
that visitors were predominantly
men and boys. Imagine a young
girl, wondering about a future in
science or engineering, opening
your newspaper at the centre spread.
Will it invite her into the exciting
world you have chosen? You can -
and should - do better than this.

I understand where you’re
coming from. However, I do not
believe these pictures are sexual.
I have never published a sexual
centrefold.I’m sure you’ve seen the
film Calendar Girls – the nudity in
our centrefolds is always along
those lines: fun, non-sexual and
silly. There is no obligation to be
fully naked, and no one in the club
is forced to take part.
Also, male students are often
in the centrefold, both in sports
teams and mixed groups.
The idea that we as women can’t
be naked in centrefolds and also
be free to rebuff unwanted sexual
advances is terribly worrying and
frankly, sad. If men see women
in the centrefold and think
they’re easy ‘objects’ available for
harassment, then the fault lies
with those men. This attitude of
policing women’s bodies, deciding
what is liberating or appropriate
for them to show or hide for
their own ‘good’ is bullshit.
FemSoc’s centrefold (Issue 1631)
is particularly hard-hitting, and
raises the issues of sexism,rape and
gender. There are plenty of ways
for clubs to promote themselves
in FELIX – the Clubs & Societies
pages, sport – and the centrefold is
just one of those. Many clubs, with
both male, female and non-binary
members, would release naked
calendars anyway, even if FELIX
didn’t have a centrefold. These are
usually fun, and always for charity.
Our newspaper does not exist
to engage young girls wandering
round the Imperial festival. It is
made by students, for students,
and forever may it remain.

Centrefold (netball)
Dear FELIX
I attended the IC Festival last
weekend it was a fantastic event.
The inspiration it provided in all
fields was exciting.
But I was completely horrified
when I picked up a copy of FELIX
1633 in the cafe. What on earth was
the thinking behind that centrefold
of the netball team? And this in the
same issue as an article about sexual
harassment. I thought we only got
those sorts of mixed messages in The
Sun!
There are few enough women
working and studying in the
sciences – what sort of message
does that kind of imagery send out
to young women and girls who may
be thinking of studying at Imperial?
I truly would like to know what
the intentions and thinking behind
that photo were and why FELIX
thought it a suitable advertisement
for women at Imperial.

The netball team were behind
what I thought was a cute, fun,
and again, non-sexual photo,
promoting their tournament.
FELIX isn’t meant to be an advert
tostudyatImperial.Thecentrefold
is one way for students to advertise
events to other students.
The fact that you’ve brought up
the cat-calling article is deeply
worrying to me. Should its writer
expect sexual harassment if she
had appeared in the centrefold?
Should she expect it if she was a
fully fledged page three model? Do
either of these things means she's
asking for it? No.

In response to, well, nothing
Hey hallmates! Like you, I'm so
happy that the year's nearly over.
It's time to relax, unwind and
exorcise those pent-up impulses.
Nevertheless, the last few end-of-
terms have gotten a bit out of hand,
and I've been left verklempt by some
baffling behaviour. I'm writing here
to tell you what's hot and what's
not so that we can all still be super-
besties!
I love parties as much as anyone.
They last to 3am, the volume's on
full-blast and the drinking games
involve Stolichnaya and gummy
bears!
Who doesn't love that? At the
end of the night (or start of the day,
depending on how wild you are),
you'll get back to your room and
return to humdrum civilian life.
For some low-energy people,
this might involve a collapse in the
general direction of the bed.
For the champions among us, you
will return to your room at 4:30am
with your new best friend, then
after forgetting protection, run up
to my neighbour’s door and yell
"[insert neighbour's name here]
GIMME A CONDOM". You will
outdo yourself every time with your
dog-yelping and epic fornications
until dawn. Please do NOT stop;
your efforts help me to wake up for
morning lectures!
Now when it comes time for
breakfast, I will stumble blearily
into the kitchen and find myself on
the set of Willy Wonka's office.
Half of the table will have
disappeared, having floated down
five flights of stairs to the common
room. It's a pretty cool party trick,
but it's actually really sad that no-
one else can witness the magic done
on their floors. My fine magician,
you have to consider their needs as
well!

Um, this is not what the letter
pages are for, but we hope your
public service announcement
works. You should probably find
a studio for next year, because
newsflash – this is what people are
like.
