I don't often sign petitions...
...but when I do, they're about food – specifically
the destruction of the BBC's recipe archive
Sanjay Battacharya
Food Editor
I
don’t often sign petitions.Most
people wouldn’t consider me
particularly politically active
- while I exercise my right to
vote, I am far too often happy to
read the news, bitch about the state
of governance in this country (or the
US – it’s really fucked up over there),
and then leave it, whilst inwardly
contemplating moving to Scotland.
To be frank, I already have an excess
of friends of Facebook who share
pseudo-libertarian/communist/new
labour/mildly xenophobic small-c
conservative updates, be they
attacking/defending the vicious
malingerer/second messiah that is
David Cameron/Jeremy Corbyn
(delete as appropriate). I don’t
want to become another person to
unfollow.
So it might have surprised some
when I shared my first petition
this week – and no, it wasn’t about
the farce that is Donald Trump, or
even the latest cuts to our beloved
NHS. Whilst those anger me,
they are too blatantly wrong to be
worth sharing a petition over. It
was about preventing something
so perversely cruel, misguided and
deliberately deconstructive that
I just had to speak out. As part
of the government's latest white
paper on the corporation, the BBC
is being forced to remove 11,000
recipes freely available without
advertisements, pop-ups or having
to link your Facebook account. I
was disgusted. The more I read, the
more disgusted I was. Our darling
chancellor, George “Cokehead”
Osborne had decided, in a fit of
rage against Nigella (despite their
shared moniker) and her lot, that,
and I quote:
“If you’ve got a website that’s
got features and cooking recipes
– effectively the BBC website
becomes the national newspaper
as well as the national broadcaster.
There are those sorts of issues we
need to look at very carefully.”
Heaven forbid people be able to
get what they paid for! Those recipes
– be they the ones that started
Jamie Oliver’s career, dripped out of
Mary Berry’s amazing repertoire of
variations on cake, or were simply
written up by one of the unpaid
interns at the Beeb – were all funded
by us, the licence fee-paying proles.
The way in which they must stop
maintaining the database will also
make it unsearchable, meaning
that a crawler engine (like Google)
won't be able to find the recipes if
you searched for them. You’d have
to know the exact URL, and they’re
not even sure they’ll keep hosting
the content at all. So, they’ll be
destroying 11,000 recipes from
the internet archives – because it’s
an issue of national importance?
Bullshit.
More than that, I object to the
second part of his reasoning –
that these features and recipes are
“issues” we need to all look at. Ah
yes, one of the main issues blocking
our road to economic recovery after
the mess the labour government left
us in, is the excess of brownies in
this country – and no, that’s not a
euphemism.
Why should we be letting petty
government oversight of a publicly
funded media group,whose sole role
is to provide varied resources for
knowledge and entertainment of the
public, prevent us from discovering
Paul Hollywood’s secret to a good
crust on your loaf? The true answer
is at the heart of this messy fight
with the BBC – cronyism.
“You wouldn’t want the BBC
to completely crowd out national
newspapers. If you look at the BBC
website it is a good product but it is
becoming a bit more imperial in its
ambitions.”
OsbornesaystheBBCisbecoming
too imperial in its ambitions -
better cut back on the number of
pavlova recipes asap! Why on earth
he thinks that cutting back on the
BBC's publicly available recipes is
going to save the failing institutions
that are this country's newspapers, I
will never know. It is through their
own resistance to adaption that they
will fail – they refuse to move into
the digital world at the same speed
as the rest of us, and it will cost
them. Already, broadsheet sales are
dropping year on year,as people turn
to one of the many free online news
providers that don’t have paywalls.
What our dear chancellor fails to
spot is that no matter how much
funding Rupert Murdoch gives his
party to bend it to his will, no one
in their right mind would ever think
“Victoria Sponge recipe – the Sun is
probably a good place to look”. No,
they’ll go to one of the myriad other

free content-hosting websites, with
hundreds of user-reviewed recipes.
Osborne's bizarre disconnect from
reality is pervasive in so many of his
policies, but it really ticks me off in
this one.It's not all bad news - some
enterprising fellows have come to
the rescue with some clever coding,
pulling the text currently available
on the BBC Food section and
making it into a freely torrentable
(which I do not advocate yada yada)
package.Why this has to happen for
those recipes to be preserved, I do
not know – but sadly, the pictures
of Ainsley Harriott in all his oily
goodness will be lost.
In even better news, the good old
British Library and the National
Library of Iceland have both
confirmed that they too have made
a full copy of all the pages that
were on the BBC’s Food section.
So all is not lost – though how
accessible their archives will be I do
not know, and I suspect that all the
comment functionality of the pages
(hurling abuse at bakers who don’t
put currants in their scones – I’m
looking at you, Mary Berry) might
be lost.
Still, I signed the petition. Who
knows? We might be able to reverse
the misguided policy, we might not.
Incidentally, I managed to get 20 of
my friends to sign too – so maybe
I’ll have to reconsider the impact of
those shared statuses on Facebook.
Perhaps Donald Trump is the
messiah I needed after all.

Why you should care about the higher
education white paper
It's not good news

T
hings got pretty busy
this week in the Union
offices with the release
of the higher education
white paper Success as a knowledge
economy: teaching excellence,
social mobility and student choice
on Monday morning; this is
the Government’s response to
consultation on the preceding
higher education green paper, of
which there was much criticism.
It was essentially 100 pages of half
baked, often misconceived ideas.
The white paper may be a significant
improvement and we are entirely
right to celebrate the massive wins
that came in response to the green
paper consultation. That said, there
is still a lot wrong with the white
paper – the battle may be won, but
the war is far from over.
One of the central principles
of the proposed changes to
higher education is the Teaching
Excellence Framework, TEF. The
idea is to have a tiered system
whereby universities have to prove
their ‘excellence’in order to move up
the levels of TEF, which then gives
them the right to charge higher fees.
The metrics against which ‘teaching
excellence’ was to be measured were
shoddy at best – I doubt many will
agree that NSS scores stack up to
the quality of teaching you receive
during your degree.
The white paper also sets out
proposals to make it easier for new,
private universities to enter the
sector and to give the government
more power to shut down existing
institutions. Ominously, it also
seems that the government will
seek to have more control over the
material which is taught to students.
Another overarching theme in the
white paper is that of social mobility.
The argument that the government’s
proposals will achieve their
supposed goal of getting students
from disadvantaged backgrounds
into high quality universities,
to result in higher academic
attainment within these groups
are wafer-thin. The general theory
within the sector is that a tiered
system of fees will only result in a
ghettoisation of higher education.
By this I mean that students from
disadvantaged backgrounds will
go to low-quality institutions to
study degrees with poor graduate
outcomes.The wealthy will continue
to gain access to high-fee, high-
quality institutions, and as a result
will get into better paid jobs. As a
result, inequality and the wealth
gap will increase, entirely contrary
to the government's alleged aim of
increasing social mobility.
It's clear that the white paper
represents some major wins. There
are areas government has listened
to the criticism of it's paper. That
said, these wins are piecemeal, and
mostly represent the finer details
of the proposal. For example, the
concept of uncapping fees was not
truly removed, only delayed.
In the green paper there was a
brief but ominous section about
student unions, which is an area
which worries me and the rest of
the sector greatly. The insinuation
was that unions lack accountability,
transparency and regulation. There
was a proposal to bring student
unions into the trade union bill.
The push-back in responses on this
from unions was strong and several
proposals from the green paper have
been dropped for the white paper,
however there are still elements that
hint that the government will come
after unions again.
The white paper states that
“responses to the green paper
highlighted the role played by
students’ unions and guilds in
higher education institutions”,
however it does not truly recognise
that unions play a huge role in
helping to shape and enhance
student experience through
student activities, volunteering
opportunities and lobbying within
universities for improved teaching
and student support.There is also,so
far not much in the way of concrete
commitments to give students a
meaningful voice, or even a seat at
the table in the proposed Office for
Students, the new body which will
regulate universities. For me this
feels like a sidelining of students
and students’ unions.
As I highlighted strongly in the
ICU response to the Green Paper,
we work very much in partnership
with the College. Our relationship
is characterised by a mutual respect
for pretty much all areas of the
College and we are always consulted
and listened to, on issues big and
small, which will affect students.
I can’t see a lot in the white paper
which truly recognises and commits
to supporting this style of working
as an integral part of the proposed
future of higher education.
The government coming after
student unions is no new thing;
every time unions come out
fighting, and often win. Clearly
it is entirely possible for student
unions to mobilise effectively in a
coordinated way, and win big battles
like these proposed reforms. These
changes will have an enormous
impact on students in years to come;
we would be failing in our jobs if we
did not fight for meaningful student
influence in these changes.
ICU will be responding to the
white paper, and I want to hear as
much student opinion as possible.
Although this is a difficult time for
everyone with academic pressures at
peak levels, if you have any opinions
about the white paper which you
would like to be incorporated into
our stance, you know where to find
me.
