their success on the drug is just the
placebo effect doing its thing.
There are other things to bear in
mind when you take them though,
L
ike all good things in life,
this article starts with
a disclaimer: FELIX is
by no means advocating
the use of these so-called study
drugs. I don’t know about you, but
shitting every hour doesn’t scream
productive work mode to me,– each
to their own. We’re just giving you
some facts and student experiences
so you can make up your own mind.
FELIX is not your mum, but it does
love you.
Are they legal to buy?
In an attempt to restrict the usage
of legal highs, which enjoyed brief
legality before the government
could change the law to include
each new one, the new Psychoactive
Substances Act was passed. Due to
come into law on May the 26th,
it is a blanket ban on all ‘mind-
altering’ substances, bar the ones
we know and love: alcohol, tobacco,
nicotine, caffeine and some foods.
The vague terminology of the act is
a problem – testing everything for
‘psychoactive’ properties is going to
be difficult. Imperial’s grandfather
of drug reform and all round great
guy Professor David Nutt told
Motherboard he doesn’t think it
will stem consumption. It will,
however, affect the legality of study
drugs, which means they’re about to
become much harder to buy online.
Currently, lots of people buy their
nootropics online, as you’d expect.
Their status is a grey-area; they are
a semi-legal substance, meaning
customers don’t have to go via the
dark web yet, and instead can buy
Russian, Eastern European or
Indian-made pills from British
companies. These snazzy websites
offer free delivery, loyalty points,
have sharp videos advertising their
‘brain-hacking’ wares and boast of
the benefits observed by Bradley
Cooper’s character in the movie
Limitless. Unlike buying from your
mate who has a prescription to treat
their ADHD or narcolepsy however,
these substances are unregulated.
Buying the off-brand drugs you see
on these sites isn’t illegal right now,
but will be when the psychoactive
substances blanket ban comes into
force. Some sites have seen a jump
in sales, as people stock up before
the 26th
of May.
Do they work?
Modafinil, a prescription drug
used to treat narcolepsy (which
causes excessive daytime sleeping),
is the only study drug we know that
is confirmed by the literature to
enhance performance during long
tasks. This 2015 study of studies
also found that mood-related and
physically unpleasant side effects
were found to be limited in most
studies, and were usually also found
in the control group. However,
most studies on smart drugs’
performance-enhancing abilities
have been on very small sample sizes.
It’s generally a very unregulated
area, so it’s hard to say whether your
generic ‘Modalert 200’ will actually
make you perform better.
Many report vaguely positive
effects when taken occasionally,
but some are unsure as to whether

Let’s be realistic. Should you take them and are they legal?

such as contraception. Modafinil
can harm an unborn foetus, and can
also stop the contraceptive pill from
working.If you can break away from
revising for long enough to have sex,
best use a condom.
One student told us: “I’m not sure
if it’s placebo or actually works but
almost all of my house took it. I
took it a few times, it’s helpful if you
want to concentrate on one thing in
particular.”
What might happen?
Unsurprisingly,these drugs are not
conducive to getting a good seven
hours the night before the exam.
If you’re taking something like
Adderall, you need to factor in the
fact that you won’t be sleeping for
at least seven hours after you take it.
Fine if you want all-nighter, but be
careful because you might be forced
to stay up all night, and wander into
the exam room looking like, well,
someone who’s stayed up all night in
the library after miscalculating their
Adderall dose.
FELIX has also heard horror
stories involving students
accidentally working intensely on
the wrong thing. You’ll want to
make sure you have all the work you
need to do right in front of you when
you start, or you might find yourself
spending seven hours rearranging
your bedroom or cleaning every
utensil in the kitchen.That increased
focus can also mean you’re less able
to do basic things because you’re so
distracted by the task at hand. Be
careful crossing roads,and definitely
don’t start playing games on your
phone – you won’t be able to stop.
However,legal drugs aren’t the
only option – don’t feel
bad if the person
next to you has
been typing
solidly for six
hours while
you’ve spent
half of your
time on
Fa c e b o o k
– they may
well be taking
some good old-
fashioned speed.
Unlike the other
drugs we’ve discussed here,
which are mainly available on
prescription for disorders relating to
lack of concentration, you are likely
to experience a raging comedown
on speed. Don’t expect that post-
exam last week of term to be all
rainbows and butterflies, because
it’ll likely be more along the lines of
existential crises and crying.
This is a Class B illegal drug, pure
and simple, so do bear that in mind.

Misuse
policy makes
no explicit
reference to
study drugs
If you take Ritalin the night before
your big test, you’re going to have to
be very careful in those post-exam
celebrations. Like all drugs, mixing
with alcohol can sometimes have
unexpected effects. The alertness
you gain when taking drugs like
Ritalin may well stop you noticing
how drunk you’re getting,
which could result in
alcohol poisoning.
Ritalin combined
with other
stimulants, like
coffee or Red
Bull, will put a
lot of pressure
on your heart,
so at the very
least, avoid
Jagerbombs.
Will I get in trouble?
Technically, possession of drugs
like Ritalin without a prescription
is illegal. If you don’t have ADHD
and you’re found with Ritalin, it’s
treated as a Class B drug, which
could get you five years in prison. In
reality,this kind of sentence is pretty
rare and you’re likely to get a slap on
the wrist or a caution. As with all
Class Bs, if you have so much that it
looks like you’re selling it, you could
be looking at an unlimited fine and
some prison time.
Imperial’s own Student Alcohol
and Substance Misuse policy
makes no explicit reference to study
drugs. It says students’ performance
must not be affected by substance
misuse, which it defines as taking a
something that “adversely interferes
with an individual’s health, work
or study performance or conduct”.
As study drugs enhance your
performance,arguablytheyshouldn’t
come under this banner.The College
does include prescription medicines
not prescribed to the user in the
definition of ‘drugs’, and insists that
they should not be brought onto
the premises. The college’s rules
also state that students must ensure
their behaviour “is not affected by
excessive alcohol consumption or
substance misuse”. That’s a no from
Imperial then.
Jennie Watson, the DPW, told
FELIX: “No Imperial student
should feel they have to take drugs to
cope with their academic workload.
We have been highlighting the
issue of student stress and its impact
on mental health to College for
a long time, and we’re pleased to
see positive changes such as more
counsellors and reductions in
coursework – but there’s still a long
way to go.”
“I’d urge students using drugs to
enhance academic performance to
consider the fact there is very little
evidence of benefit and that the long
term effects are broadly unknown.”
Make up your own mind, but if
you’ve really not revised, it’s unlikely
a Ritalin dose will save you.

least, avoid
