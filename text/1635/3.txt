Petition started to get air conditioning in library
The change.org petition needs your signature
T
he college got planning
permission for air
conditioning units on
the library’s roof two
years ago, but little has happened
since then. The library told FELIX
earlier this week that sorting out the
temperature of the worst affected
top floors would cost in the region
of £13.5 million and that so far,
college had only allocated them half
of that figure.
They’re still waiting on the other
half, and that’s where you come in.
Only you guys can make this
happen. If you want to be an agent
of real change, sign our change.org
petition, requesting that Imperial
put air conditioning in the library.
Then spread the word, because
without those numbers, college
simply won’t listen.
We know £6.75 million is a lot of
money,but we also know college has
that kind of cash. We, as Imperial,
don’t ask for much. We don’t occupy
lecture theatres or go on rent strikes.

Aero students get free tickets to will.i.am gig after director spots them in their boiler
suits outside the Royal Albert Hall

...even managed to bag a selfie
with the man himself.
One student told FELIX that it
was an “unforgettable experience”,
with another adding: “I arrived late
and it was so easy to find my mates:
I just asked ‘have you seen blue
people like me?’ and everybody was
able to indicate the direction with a
big smile.”
The free gig was to promote will’s
new wearable tech venture, ‘dial’,
a smartwatch with an AI, about
which he cracked wise throughout
the night in breaks between songs.
The night included cameos from
old members of the Black Eyed
Peas, Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser
Chiefs and Tinie Tempah.

So let’s politely request that the
library, where many of us have spent
so many uncomfortable, sweaty
hours, gets some air con.
The library is not to blame – the
librarians want air conditioning as
much as we do. So let’s help them
out by demanding that college
stump up the money and finally get
this sorted.
A consultation in 2014 found
that the most common library gripe
amongst students was the fact that
it was too hot. They’ve done their
market research, and now the work
just needs to be funded.
So, sign it today at
felixonline.co.uk/go/library. Time is
running out – planning permission
doesn’t last forever. The quicker we
persuade college,the more likely you
are to benefit from the change. This
week’s white paper makes it clear
that students are now customers.
Universities will have to start paying
attention to satisfaction ratings, as
it will affect how much they can
charge in fees. Imperial, like any
other university, has to care what its
students want. And now, we have to
tell them what we need.
