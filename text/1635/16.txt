That’s so Ratchet

n the 14 years since Ratchet
& Clank’s original release
on the PS2, the platforming
genre has seen a dramatic
decline. Nintendo has been the sole
torchbearer in a genre which was
once the industry’s most successful;
it continues to produce quality and
innovative platformers while others
have almost abandoned the genre
completely. Despite the critical (and
commercial flops) of recent releases
in franchises like Ratchet & Clank,
Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro, many
still remember these series fondly
– even when they are undeserving.
Society is so obsessed with nostalgia
that we often misremember and
ignore flaws. However, in a rare
few cases the first games in these
franchises are deserving of praise.
In these cases we must ask the
question: are these games only great
when considered within the context
of when they were released?
Video game companies have
begun in the last decade to exploit
nostalgia by reimagining and
rebooting series, in the hope that
gamers will forget about previous
missteps. Ratchet & Clank is
interesting in that it is not only a
reboot of the series (after more than
a dozen sequels), but a remaking
of the original game. Without
changing much, Insomniac’s
these two types of gameplay can be
exhilarating and it creates the sense
of being an action-hero far better
than other mature franchises do
today.
After only a few minutes with the
game, it is obvious that is more than
a HD remake; many elements of
the game have been changed. The
most obvious is the massive visual
overhaul. Other than Uncharted
4, no other game on PS4 is more
visually impressive. From the lush
planetscapes, with glistening vistas
on the horizon, to gloomy acidic
underworlds, every texture and
model is polished and refined.

Ratchet’s fur and other similar
graphical details add up to create the
best looking platformer ever. This
is proof a game doesn’t have to be
realistic (or gritty) to be technically
impressive.
Trying to explain this installment
in the franchise to someone else
can get quite confusing. It’s based
(loosely) on a movie which is based
characters are weird throwbacks
to early noughties tropes (e.g. the
skater dude) and the script is often
gratingly cheesy especially when it
breaks the fourth wall. The story it
tells is not particularly interesting,
but is told well.
While a lot of original level
designs have been reused, the
developers have added new worlds
and gameplay sections to ensure it
doesn’t feel too familiar to players of
the original. Clank’s puzzle sections,
where you control a number
of different Gadgebots (each
performing a different purpose),
provide a refreshing change of pace
from the action packed shooting
of Ratchet, even if these levels
are too easy. One notable new
weapon turns enemies into pixels
and the weapon system as a whole
has been overhauled adding more
customisation to things like weapon
accuracy, ammo capacity, and
damage.
For a game where very little has
changed, it feels incredibly modern.
Insomniac have perfectly balanced
the new with the old. Rather
than relying solely on nostalgia,
they have made changes where
appropriate and where the game
would have truly shown its age.
Many were worried that Ratchet
and Clank might not hold up after
14 years of innovation, but it does.
A franchise that was almost lost,has
now returned from the brink.

For a game

reimagining of the original game
feels fresh. It is still as exciting as it
was all those years ago, a testament
to the original release.
While Nintendo platformers
might have revolutionised the
environments players inhabit (Super
Mario Galaxy) and multiplayer
functionality (New Super Mario
Bros.), the combat in their games
has changed very little. Many
rightfully regard Ratchet & Clank
as an action-platformer; it brilliantly
combines melee and third-person
shooting mechanics. Traversing the
environment and its obstacles is
similar to any other 3D platformer,
but if you hold down the left trigger
you are able to enter a strafing
movement mode which is better
suited to combat (borrowing more
from third-person shooters like
Gears of War). Switching between

and it includes some footage from
this film in between gameplay
segments. Insomniac are aware that
this is all a bit ridiculous, so have
framed the game as a retelling of
the original by Captain Qwark. His
often unreliable narration is amusing
and is an attempt by the developers
to fit this game into canon. Some
