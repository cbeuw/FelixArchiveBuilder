A
third of the way through
the season and it’s really
starting to get going.We
pick up at theWall where
Jon apparently had to pop back into
Castle Black after storming off last
episode (“Jon you’ll need a coat! You
of all people should know winter is
coming!”). We then get the first of
the episode’s many reunions when
Sansa and Jon meet for the first time
since back at the start of Season one.
They have a really heart-warming
scene reminiscing about Winterfell
and Sansa attempts to convince
Jon to take it back from Ramsay.
(“Hey brother I used to be a dick
to! Wanna go murder my ex?”).
Brienne also walks over to Davos
and Mel just to let them know that
she murdered Stannis, the man they
gave their lives to. She’s not the best
at making friends, is she?
We then head back to the Vale (get
your maps out, folks) where Irish
Batman (or Littlefinger,as he prefers
to be called) drops in to threaten an
old man then manipulate a teenager.
Standard Littlefinger stuff really,
not sure that even he knows exactly
what the plan is there.
Tyrion’s scene was a great return
to the diplomacy from season two,
just in Meereen. Turns out, no
matter where you are, you can get
ahead in negotiations by employing
prostitutes. Take notes business
students. There were hints of the
former slaves being unhappy about
the terms that were reached but
we’ll just have to wait and see how
this turns out for the dwarf and
eunuch (isn’t that the name of a
pub?).
plan.
We then return to King’s Landing
and it’s Margaery’s turn to appear
on the High Sparrow’s talk show.
They have a bit of bible study
before he begins reminiscing about
some orgy he went to a while ago
after he made some bitching shoes
and sends Margaery to speak with
Loras. He’s completely broken at
this point; apparently there’s torture
worse than getting read to by a nun.
Cersei asks Tommen what the
old man has been telling him and
Tommen says he promised not to
tell his parents. Nothing odd there.
Cersei and Jaime storm into the
small council chambers to plot with
the Tyrells to overthrow the Faith
Militant and save Margaery before
she has to repeat Cersei’s walk of
shame. I’m not entirely sure that
Incest Team Rocket can be trusted
on this one; Cersei doesn’t seem too
worried about the upcoming Trial
is appreciated anyway.
Darth Ramsay has a quick scene
where a woman tries to have sex
with him and then he stabs her in
the throat. I can’t imagine Osha’s
actress was thrilled getting her
script for this season
Afterwards, we head back to
Castle Black to a meal fraught with
sexual tension between Brienne and
Tormund with Edd looking on with
an expression of horror. A Bolton
man arrives with a letter for Jon. To
paraphrase; “Come at me bro, I’m
proper mental. P.S. Gimme my wife
back”. Ramsay was never one for
subtlety. Tormund then pledges the
Wildling army to help Jon.
For the episode’s finale, we head
back to Vaes Dothrak where Dany
is under judgment. The Dothraki
continue to, surprisingly, be the
comic relief, having a couple of
great lines. For the trial, however,
Dany’s not the most diplomatic sort
so her idea of a defence argument is
calling the judges a bunch of pussies
and setting the courthouse on fire.
She then strolls out and welcomes
the gathered horde bowing to her. I
guess she’s a big believer in ‘If it ain’t
broke don’t fix it’.
Certainly the best of the season
so far, this episode had a big theme
of reunions and brother sister team
ups. It also really got things moving
in many of the storylines that had
been treading water a bit, it really is
starting to feel like we’re building
up to the finale now.
Game of Thrones is available on
HBO Go
Super Daario and Jorah the
Explorah have an argument about
who’s going to bang Dany before
finding Vaes Dothrak and sneaking
in unarmed. Except Daario stashed
a knife. It’s just who he is. We get
another quick scene of Dany in the
bingo club before she storms out,
finding the boys and hatching a
by Combat so there’s not much gain
for her in this deal as far as I can see.
Another return to the Iron Isles
with Theon. Yara makes a couple
of dick jokes at his expense before
he makes her feel bad by crying
and pledging to help her become
Queen at the Kingsmoot. I’m not
too sure what a tortured, cockless
guy with missing fingers can do to
help exactly but I’m sure the gesture
