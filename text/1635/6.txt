Scientists need to start caring about politics
Forget ISIS or Trump, apathy is the greatest threat to democracy

T
he recent election
season has got me in the
political spirit, and I have
been reminded of the
shameful situation that continues
to both bemuse and inflame me:
the Science and Technology
Select Committee. This grand,
administrative behemoth, whose
expansive remit covers everything
from big data to genetics, with its
cross-party composition and its
inquiry-laden legislature, sets the
national agenda on science policy.
In a world where science policy is of
growing importance, occupying all
the top spots on international issues,
be they climate change or viral
pandemics, the UK Government
needs to take leadership and forge
the path to a sustainable future.
But fear not, for who should chair
the Commons Select Committee
for Science and Technology? None
other than Nicola Blackwood,
an esteemed parliamentarian
with a doctorate in – wait for
it – musicology. It sounds like
something out of a Mitchell and
Webb sketch, only the reality is far
less funny. Indeed, of the eleven
MPs that comprise this essential
facet of Government, only seven
have graduated from a university
and a whopping four have a science
degree.
This probably doesn’t surprise you;
the British Government’s lack of
scientists is not news.The last time I
recall a scientist being involved with
politics, it was 2009, when Professor
David Nutt was sacked after
publishing a scientific paper into
the social harms of illicit drugs.This
not only demonstrates the anaemic
quantities of scientific rationale
in government, but that no major
scientist has taken the political stage
for seven years.
For once, perhaps, this second
point is not down to faults of the
government or an incompetent
politician, but is a sad reflection of a
global scientific consensus: political
apathy.
Maybe it is the lack of objectivity
that comes with policymaking, or
the narrow-focused research mind-
set that is instilled in students from
the start, but the trend is clear:
scientists don’t care.
Even here at Imperial College
London, an institution with some
of the sharpest young minds on the
planet, we have a student Labour

Party Society that was almost shut
down last year due to a lack of
members (and committee), and
our own student think tank that no
one has heard of. There are plenty
of reasons why Imperial students
might be less politically active than
our university counterparts, but
explaining away our predicament
does not solve anything.
With the possible exception of the
aspiring bankers, Imperial students
are entering careers whose funding
and regulations are governed by
people who couldn't tell you the
difference between a proton and a
protein.
So why haven’t our science and
technology industries collapsed into
pandemonium? Well, fortunately,
some our MPs became painfully
aware of this gaping qualification
gap, and so set up the Parliamentary
Office for Science and Technology
(POST) back in 1989, to research
and brief MPs on scientific issues
of the day. Initially staffed by one
researcher, the humble institution
represented how small the realm
of science policy was but a mere 30
years ago.
But much has since changed, and
today POST has a larger executive
board than the entire Commons
Select Committee for Science and
Technology, its own Fellowship
programme and briefs both Houses
of Parliament.
Many do not have a problem with
this set up, but the fact that we
have to introduce an undemocratic
We need a
parliament

armed with
scientists
institution to compensate for the
shortage of scientists in parliament
speaks volumes. Few in this country
have the scientific know-how to
understand the implications of
the UK’s science policy, and those
who do, don’t vote. This is not just
a British problem; global science
policy increasingly relies on a few
voices of undemocratic research
organisations for guidance. These
views do not represent broad
national perspectives and instead
hide behind the veil of objectivity at
the cost of our democracy.
As our species makes strides in
science and technology like never
before, we need now, more than
ever, a democratic machine to
fairly govern this new world. We
need a parliament properly armed
with scientists, a population ready
to criticise them and a national
voice prepared to debate them.
Instead, we are sleepwalking into
technocracy, bestowing control of
the fastest growing and increasingly
important policy area on unelected,
faceless institutions.
Apathy has consequences.
Scientists and students alike have
long been silent voices on the
political stage, and as a result,
governments have turned elsewhere
for guidance. Whilst it may be
easier to try and opt out of the
system, become disenfranchised
and complain that it's all rigged, it
is vital that you find the courage to
engage head-on with democracy
whilst we still have it. Citizenship
is not a part-time job; if you’re
unhappy with policy, at any level,
write to your local councillor, visit
your MP, or best of all, reflect your
dissatisfaction at the ballot box. If
you don’t engage, politicians won’t
try and win you over.
