Funky fungal psychedelic ain’t all
bad, depression study finds
Science
& the City
Questions on ethics arise in all
fields of science, from vaccinations
to military weapons. But given
the mutability of morality and
ethical stances across cultures,
individuals, and time, it’s difficult
to pinpoint where the lines of what
is moral should be drawn. What
of the devastating effects of the
Manhattan Project, the morals of
which physicist Richard Fenyman
had always been fairly tight-lipped
about? Was it wrong to pursue the
development of our capability to
split atomic nuclei even though the
scientists knew it would be used for
application on humans? Or what of
the endless case of the anti-vaxxer,
in which the scientific community
has decided that individual consent
is irrelevant in light of the greater
social good? These are complex
issues with no easy answer, but are
dearly worth considering in our
own endeavours.
Scientists often take a class
in ethics at some point in their
education, and there are many
ethical forms one can fill out and
clear in the pursuit of their research.
But ultimately, it’s an odd mix of
what the individual scientist and
institutions are willing to research
and practice, paired with what the
larger scientific community agrees
is acceptable, and is in periodic
response to some social pressures.
Interestingly enough, some have
even argued that science – aiming
at objectivity, knowledge, and truth
– could actually act as a beacon to
determine what our human morals
should be, and help us figure out
what is right or wrong. This flies
in the face of those who value
neutrality as a core tenet of scientific
endeavours.
Regardless,like a carefully planned
game of chess,scientists should look
ahead to the possible implications
of their research and decide if the
outcomes are worth the pursuit. I,
for one, certainly don’t believe any
knowledge is inherently bad in and
of itself, but that its application
can nonetheless be used to hinder
or help humanity. As we transition
from our studies into research,
development, and application, we
should all aim to use science as a
tool of progress and development,
though inevitably, what that means
is constantly and vaguely in flux.

Science, what’s good?
Exciting research from NASA’s
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in
California, suggests Europa, one
of Jupiter’s 67 moons may hide an
ocean that is chemically similar to
Earth’s. If you’re unfamiliar with
the alien moon, know that it is
slightly smaller than our moon, and
is considered one of the smoothest
solid objects in our solar system,
which has led scientists to believe it
hides an ocean beneath its surface.
It is this element that suggests
that despite its lack of volcanic
activity, Europa could be host to
life. Europa’s rocky interior reacts
with the seawater producing new
minerals and releasing hydrogen.
This hydrogen reacts with molecules
released from the pounding of the
icy surface by Jupiter’s radiation,
releasing oxidants. If the moon is
dead inside (has no volcanic core)
it might allow for just the right
chemical balance to support life.
Plans for future missions are being
made that will hopefully shed more
light.

In more ‘breaking news’, a recent
study showed that financial support
really helps students with learning
disabilities to complete assignments
and get extra support from faculty,
outside of teaching hours.The study
looked at university students in
the US with learning disabilities:
comparing those receiving special
accommodation, with those less
fortunate. However, the study also
suggested that affluence of students
played a key role in their likelihood
of receiving additional support.
Wealthier students struggling
with learning disabilities tended
to receive support more often than
low-income students. The pattern
was also reflected in comparison
without-of-state students, who
generally pay higher tuition fees
than in-state students and are more
likely to be better off, financially. A
possible explanation is that receiving
support is subject to providing
adequate proof, which requires tests
that cost money to take. Long story
short: money makes life easier.

It might come as a shock but
when it comes down to maintaining
a happy relationship, it might
be about those on the outside of
your circle of trust, rather than
those on the inside. New research
shows that when Frankie Valli was
writing his hit song, ‘Can’t take my
eyes off you’, he forgot to add, “...
unless there’s lots of hotter people
around, or you’re completely out of
my league”. Okay, maybe the study
didn’t quite find that, but it might
as well have. The study found that
participants who were with partners
less desirable than themselves were
only happy in their relationship if
their partner was a closer match to
their ‘ideal’ mate than most other
available mates. The only people
that didn’t quite seem to care
about other potential mates were
those whose partners were more
desirable than themselves. Similarly,
participants put in a lot more work
in maintaining their relationship if
their partner was “just too good to
be true”.That’s love for ya.

A new study creepily titled ‘I
know where you live’ showed that
it’s not only possible, but in fact
relatively easy to discover someone’s
home and work addresses, simply
by looking at the location stamps
of their posts. The MIT researcher
behind the study followed
the activity of Twitter users in
the Boston area, and asked 45
participants who had no particularly
relevant expertise to try and deduce
what they could about the users.
The wannabe private eyes, managed
to correctly pinpoint users’ home
addresses 65 percent of the time
and work addresses as often as 75
percent of the time. When provided
with additional data (a whopping
five days worth of tweets) accuracy
of workplace geolocation climbed
up to 85 percent. Participants
‘shockingly’ performed better when
provided with mapped data. Results
were controlled with users from
Oxford to eliminate the possibility
of participants simply being familiar
with the ‘hip and happening’ areas
of Boston.

There’s been a lot of attention
recently on the improvement of
solar power yield, however it seems
that we hadn’t quite heard the last
of wind power research. A team
of scientists recently came to the
conclusion that a particular form
of carbon coating dramatically
improves wind turbine efficiency,
by prolonging their life expectancy.
The scientists, while developing
lubricants, had a ‘YOLO’ moment
and decided to test the coating
on wind turbine drivetrains,
having low expectations. Alas,
the coating was destined for wind
turbines, going through more
than 100 million testing cycles
without showing any surface cracks
(known as micropitting).The only
problem is that they are unable to
understand how this coating works,
so the scientists can’t improve on it
quite yet. Could be worse.

W
ith exams drawing
near, many think
setting aside time
for a dedicated
workout is simply not worth it.
The mere idea of walking to Ethos
makes you die a little inside. Long-
drawn lectures and revision means
the treadmill is off the agenda on
weekdays, so you settle for that walk
to the library, the occasional sprint
to the toilet. 30-minute run? Forget
it – that would mean a shower,
makeup (hear hear, females), and
that would be your weekday or
weekend evening gone. Friends,
there is a small saving grace.
You may have heard of the
Scientific Seven-minute Workout,
and if you haven’t, you’ve probably
heard of HIIT, otherwise known as
high intensity interval training. But
what exactly is this seven-minute
specialty?
It is, essentially, a workout that
encompasses the benefits of HIIT
in one lovely manageable burst,
with the most scientific data to back
it up.I’m one of the late ones on this
having just recently discovered it in
the dusty corners of the Internet
(circa 2014, would you believe it?).
HIIT is a common method used to
spike the metabolism,by alternating
between intense bursts of exercise,
and then less intense exercise or
complete rest. By tapping quickly
into anaerobic reserves, it has been
proven to increase endurance by at
least 11% after its incorporation
three times weekly, improve overall
cardiovascular health, and believe it
or not, increase production of the
human growth hormone by up to
450% during the 24 hours after your
workout.
Its label,being what it is,prompted
me to research the science behind
this phenomenon. All you need
is a chair and a wall. The exercises
themselves are very simple, all of
which everyone has tried before.
Cue pushups, jumping jacks, and
chair step-ups. The sequence of
exercises, that should be done with
maximum intensity and in rapid
succession, are designed to increase
fat oxidation capacity and boost
your metabolism like nothing else
by the end of it. I do believe the
label has been a little misinterpreted
because there hasn’t been a proper
experimental trial, though the
benefits of short, intense HIIT
workouts are sound, drastically
improving cardio-metabolic health
and insulin sensitivity.
Having tried this myself recently,
I can say I definitely felt its effects
almost immediately. If anything,
seven minutes of HIIT gets your
blood pumping, heart rate up, and
metabolism going. So if you’re one
of those who think a short run in
Hyde Park is the equivalent of
drawing blood from a stone on your
hungover Saturday morning, I beg
you to rethink your fitness agenda.

This is not

time a
psilocybin
study is
conducted
at Imperial

oomers, silly cybin,
caps, little smoke, cubes,
musk, silly putty, sherm,
simple simon, god’s
flesh, shrooms. Psilocybin fungi
go by many names, but they’re
more commonly known as magic
mushrooms.These humble fungi are
predominantly used recreationally
as entheogens (what a word),
substances that induce psychological
or physiological changes, often used
in a religious, or spiritual context.
Users claim they can induce
euphoria, synesthesia, alter the way
we think and perceive time, and
generally aid at the journey towards
transcendence. In other words
they’re a hallucinogen that will send
you on a pretty psychedelic trip. All
in all, there is general consensus
that shrooms are pretty strong stuff,
which explains why they're illegal in
most countries around the world
Despite many governments’
(including our own) strong no-
no stance on shrooms, research is
occasionally green lit – some of it in
our own back yard. Indeed, some of
it takes place here at Imperial and
it recently yielded results suggesting
shrooms might be beneficial for
those struggling with depression.
The study, published in The Lancet
Psychiatry, aimed at investigating
whether patients with depression,
could tolerate doses of psilocybin
without exhibiting adverse side
effects,such as anxiety and paranoia,
which the UK government
considered serious enough to
warrant a ban. The ban took effect
with the 2005 Drugs Act, which
reclassified mushrooms as a class
A drug, making possession a crime
that could induce a seven year
prison sentence.
This is not the first time a
psilocybin study has been conducted
at Imperial. In 2014, research
illuminated what areas of the brain
are activated by shrooms and
showed that brains of users exhibit
similar patterns to brains of people
who are dreaming. Patients with
moderate and severe depression
who are resistant to treatment
volunteered to receive Home
Office-approved psilocybin capsules
twice over seven days, as well as
close monitoring, not only during
the drug administration but also at
regular intervals over the following
five weeks.
Results showed a complete lack
of adverse reactions (with the
exception of anxiety right before the
drug administration, and at the very
start of the psychedelic experience,
which is probably just a result of
the bad rep shrooms have) and also
a decrease of depression symptoms
which, for a few patients, lasted to
the Department of Medicine at
Imperial College London, made
reserved comments regarding
the research. “Psychedelic drugs
have potent psychological effects
and are only given in our research
when appropriate safeguards are in
place, such as careful screening and
professional therapeutic support.
I wouldn't want members of the
public thinking they can treat their
own depressions by picking their
own magic mushrooms. That kind
of approach could be risky.”
Although anticlimactic, his
under-enthused comments were
probably strategic rather than an
honest reflection of his excitement,
considering Prof David Nutt’s fate
in 2009, which was sealed when he
claimed that tobacco and alcohol
are in fact much more harmful than
many illegal drugs and suggested
what some (Jacqui Smith)
considered a radical reclassification.
While Prof Nutt’s outspokenness
cost him his position as the
government’s chief drug adviser, to
the public’s dismay, Dr Carhart-
Harris has managed to stay on the
government’s right side becoming,
in 2014, the first scientist in over
40 years to have been granted
permission for testing LSD on
humans. The LSD study, which
again enlisted a number of
volunteers, used brain scanning to
look at how the brain works under
the psychedelic substance.The study
showed that under the influence,
volunteers used more areas of the
brain for visual processing than
they would normally and that the
compartmentalization of their brain,
which usually allows different parts
of the brain to perform separate
tasks, broke down possibly causing
the phenomenon some people call
‘ego-dissolution’.

research is taking place and how to
get involved, don’t worry. So are we.
