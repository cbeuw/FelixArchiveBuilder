I ' V E B E E N teasing P a u l a l l week thatl'd leave this space
blank, as a momento to h i s many spoof pages. That, though,
would be too unkind a gesture to someone who's put a tremendous
amount of work into the U n i o n ' s hardest sabbatical j o b . So
here goes!
B e l i e v e it or not P a u l E s i e n Inang Ukorebi Ekpenyong (phew!)
was born in E a s t London in 1953. After various 'liberal studies'
at Tottenham T e c h n i c a l C o l l e g e , P a u l came to I C in 1973,
supposedly to study Mathematics. H e soon r e a l i s e d this mistake
and resolved to make a big impact on the IC s o c i a l life and the
a c t i v i t i e s of IC U n i o n . Three y e a r ' s later he c a n justifiably
say he has succeeded (even S i r B r i a n ' s secretary knows him
as Pingpong).
T o c a l l P a u l an a l c o h o l i c and a gourmet would certainly be
true, but that in itself would g l o s s over many a humerous o c c a s i o n .
After a l l how would y o u go about celebrating the fact that you
never get a hangover, however much booze you consumed?
P a u l ' s a l c o h o l i c intake has at times given rise to many a
precarious situation, particularly during h i s year as F E L I X
E d i t o r . N e v e r t h e l e s s , despite w a l k i n g along and a c r o s s the tube
lines at West Kensington station (after one too many g l a s s e s of
Abbot), and despite a rather arrogant encounter with a taxi
driver in Soho Square, w h i c h w a s only resolved when Pingpong
jumped onto the taxi-cab bonnet screaming 'take me to Soho'
(even he can't remember how much h e ' d had to drink that night),
P a u l has managed to survive h i s year a s editor.
One notable incident happened at the end of his first term a s
F E L I X Editor at a party given by R i c k y Graham and friends.
Pingpong arrived rather drunk, to put it politely, and proceeded
to down half a bottle of whiskey in two gulps. Minutes later he
was seen chatting to John Downs and J u l i a R o s s . Apparently he
managed to talk intelligently for half an hour before p a s s i n g out,
clutching a pint of lager! After being carried home he decided to
walk into a shower fully clothed.
O n o c c a s i o n s he has been s e e n sober, although he s t i l l
maintains frequent appearances in the Union B a r , despite the
fact that the bar staff once decided to strip him after hours, and
despite frequent threats from h i s bank manager.
His eating habits are probably l e s s well-known, although
many students w i l l have guessed them after his frequent journalistic
attacks on Mr Mooney's catering. Many restaurants, e s p e c i a l l y
the Great American S u c c e s s , have a l s o experienced the by-
products of P a u l ' s gastronomic d i s s a t i s f a c t i o n . In fact h e ' s
always complaining about the hamburgers at G A S . H e heatedly
bangs h i s fist on the table v a i n l y trying to get the b i l l reduced.
He doesn't l i k e their milk shakes either.
Sloppy waiter service i s another source of annoyance to
Pingpong, who at times has had to be forcibly restrained from
a s s a u l t i n g waiters. Restaurants aren't the only p l a c e s that
P a u l ' s got e v i c t e d from. Many o f h i s friends remember a certain
event that took place at a West E n d Cinema. A spurious comment
to an extremely voluptuous doorgirl s a w P a u l and h i s friends
(who'd already paid for their tickets) promptly e v i c t e d from the
building.
So far I haven't s a i d much about P a u l as an editor, although
Tony Jones doesn't seem to have left me much room for manoeuvre.
Pingpong has a great capacity for work, surely fostered by h i s
unique ability to go without sleep for long periods. He rarely
d i s p l a y s any after effects, although recently he has looked a
bit haggered (I don't think h e ' s learnt judo yet).
A s an editor h e ' s been a great source of inspiration to h i s
fellow staff members of the last two years and has encouraged a
delegation of responsibility (from copyreaders onwards). H e ' s a
pleasant, humerous character who gets on w e l l with people. A
friend who's never afraid to make a fool of himself i n the interests
of h i s job (just look at the quotes file).
In h i s year as editor, P a u l has done much to iron-out the
remaining technical d i f f i c u l t i e s of offset-litho, as w e l l a s
extending the role that F E L I X p l a y s at I C . It is perhaps unfortunate
that he w i l l be remembered for the mistakes he has made
rather than the stability he has given the paper.
Unlike the predecessor, who P a u l describes a s a ' n o s t a l g i c
sentimentalist', Pingpong i s a self-confessed c y n i c , whose
intermittent disregard of women has often fouled up h i s
relationships with the same. T h i s term h e ' s finally got h i s s e x
life sorted out, although there w a s a time when he was frantically
writing out programmes for the C D C computer i n an effort to get
his confused objectives straightened out. So now y o u know why
the C D C ' s been 'going down' recently, i t ' s P a u l ' s l o v e - l i f e
stretching its f a c i l i t i e s !
After 700 words I think I've said enough to destroy P a u l ' s
credibility, and given y o u a c l e a r idea of the man himself. A l l
that remains to be done i s to gather together the remnants of this
year's staff and sift through the books that P a u l suggests I read
The latter include How to get your bum^bitten (twice) by an IF
President and Sensual Massage. Both are a v a i l a b l e from your
local Cromwell Mews bookshop.
P S P a u l doesn't write the T P column.

" P L E A S E P A U L , C A N I H A V E T H E
F R O N T P A G E " i s a cry that I have
heard many a time this year. It invariably
comes from no lesser a person than
Mark C a l d w e l l , who h a s , for the past
two years been the Chairman of S T O I C .
He is usually trying to get one of h i s
now famous "Film Talk" programmes
blazened across the front page of
F E L I X .
Mark i s the sort of chap that o l d
ladies refer to a s "What a polite young
m a n " , for he is polite and extremely
modest. A trait >ne might not expect to
find i n ' a media man.
Often seen strutting between the
S T O I C studios and the Union — l i n e s of
communication are very tenuous these
days — Mark presents the typical image
of a public school b o y . ( H e ' l l probably
shoot me for saying that because h i s
opiniotv of these bastions of upper c l a s s
education is extremely l o w . )
Although he came here to study
P h y s i c s , a subject he does not find
particularly f a s c i n a t i n g , he h a s spent a
substantial part of h i s time involved
with S T O I C . F i r s t prompted by a S T O I C
notice i n T o p i c w h i c h he found l y i n g
around in Keogh H a l l , he went one
production meeting after another and has
not looked back s i n c e . Neither has S T O I C .
H i s first interview proved abortive
when, after sweltering under studio
lights for half an hour, h i s interviewees
didn't show up. H i s second interview
with Don Monro was i n h i s own words
" b l o o d y a w f u l " . Since then h i s inter-
viewing technic has improved although
he has made inevitable s l i p s now and
then. O n c e , interviewing Prof L a i t h w a i t e
he muffed h i s third question on the
fourth or fifth re-take. P r o f L a i t h w a i t e
was "quite cutting" about the whole
affair.
Mark has shied away interviewing
academics s i n c e then and finds l e s s of
a problem talking to film stars although
they too can get out of hand. Interviewing
Barry Humphreys of Barry M c K e n z i e
fame, he had t e a spilt on h i s notes by
Barry, who turned up dressed in drag as
Dame E d n a E v e r i d g e . M a r k ' s comment
later w a s "How do you talk to a man
who pretends to be a woman?"
H i s many interviewes include M e l
Brooks who took off M a r k ' s g l a s s e s as
he w a s about to introduce a film c l i p ,
Christopher L e e who threatened to walk
off the interview if D r a c u l a w a s brought
into the conversation and G l e n d a J a c k s o n
who threatened to poke h i s e y e s out with
the women's l i b flagpole! However, says
Mark, this latter interview w a s h i s most
enjoyable.
The " F i l m T a l k " s e r i e s , of which
these interviews are a part, has a c h i e v e d
a great deal of s u c c e s s and most of them
are made outside the C o l l e g e . T h e y are
broadcast off the I L E A ' S Channel 7
network and replaced a rather similar
but inferior programme they used to put
out.
A s with other media men, Mark i s
always worried about h i s audience.
Audience ratings are a yardstick by
which a programme i s adjudged
s u c c e s s f u l . T h e formula that he h a s
found that works i s " n o i s y or dirty film
c l i p s and big n a m e s " — the p r e c i s e
ingredients of "Film Talk", he w a s
quite chuffed to find w e l l over 100
people sitting quietly i n the J C R watching
the re-run of the T i m Curry interview.
The s u c c e s s of S T O I C with "Film
Talk and the "Lunchbreak" magazine
programme has brought i t s rewards. T h e
Rector has taken a keen interest in
S T O I C since being interviewed and
the result, after many letters from Mark,
is that S T O I C now have u s e of editing
f a c i l i t i e s costing about £6,000. In
addition, "Film Talk" i s now an
"industry approved" programme; this
f a c i l i t a t e s procurement of c l i p s for the
programmes.
Has he enjoyed being S T O I C C h a i r m a n .
Y e s . H e has been interviewed b y B B C
Radio L o n d o n , mentioned i n the E v e n i n g
News and has a glowing job reference
from Barry Brown, producer of B B C ' s
F i l m Night. H e i s currently trying to get
into one of the independent T V companies
— " a n y o n e w h i c h ' l l take m e " . I'm sure
that despite h i s lack of luck at the
moment he w i l l eventually breakthrough
and F E L I X w i s h e s him the best for the
future.
