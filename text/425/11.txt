STOIC: Review of the year's activities
I A M J U S T A S W E E T transvestite from
Transexual T r a n s y l v a n i a . So sang T i m
Curry i n a c l i p from the "Rocky Horror
Show" which opened the first 'Film Talk'
of the s e s s i o n . T h i s w a s the first
programme i n the series to be recorded i n
the near broadcast quality studios of the
I L E A ' S Educational T e l e v i s o n Centre.
Next came Dirk Bogarde. He was i n thee
country to promote h i s latest film
'Permission to Kill' and a s well a s
appearing on S T O I C , he w a s interviewed
by C a p i t a l and R u s s e l Harty.
Having recorded the interview, c l i p s
from h i s many films had to be acquired.
Therein lay a problem. If you want a c l i p
from a film which i s no longer on release
you have to pay £270 for each minute
of film used to the Kinematograph
Renter's Society, a body which looks after
the interests of the distributors. Further
investigation revealed that if your
programme i s industry approved you
don't have to pay anything. F i l m T a l k i s
now an industry approved programme.
N e x t , Terry-Thomas, who had come from
I b i z a to premote 'Spanish Fly'. Several
c r i t i c s vehemently expressed their doubts
as to the quality of this film. T h i s
Theatre
When the new National Theatre
building w a s being planned it w a s
decided that besides the two conventional
auditoria there should be s small studio
theate with flexible seating arrangements,
to be known as the C o t t e s l o e . B e c a u s e
the C o t t e s l o e i s not yet ready, the
National Theatre Company h a s taken
over the Young V i c , in the cut by
Waterloo Station, for a season lasting
through the summer. T h e first production,
Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida
opened last week and runs until July
22nd in repertory.
Troilus and Cressida w a s written at
about the same time as Hamlet and this
production contains many of the familiar
faces from the N a t i o n a l ' s " A l b e r t
F i n n e y " Hamlet, thus helping those of
us who delight in spotting the parts that
Shakespeare wrote for the same actor;
for example F e s t e , Touchstone and the
Porter i n Macbeth, or here, P o l o n i u s
Agamemnon, O s r i c and A j e x .
The audience i s greeted, on amval, by
an imposing circus ring surrounded by a
four foot high wall and surfaced with
neatly raked damp sawdust. At one
moment I was almost sorry that the
designer had forgotten the lion tamer's
c a g e , although the small space ensured
that the battles never got out of hand.
Instead of Liberty H o r s e s and performing
seals we have a lot of verbal c l a w i n g ,
some wailing and a bit of sulking before
the long play reaches it c l i m a x in the
fight between Hector and A c h i l l i e s ,
aided by h i s hymidons, unpleasant
looking men with masks and a variety of
nasty weapons, who d i s p a t c h Hector i n
a number of ways.
The play is the only one that Shakes-
peare wrote about the Greeks (unless
you include A Midsummer Night's Dream)
and takes place during the siege of
Troy. Whilst the tittle might suggest a
momenta! love match in the style of
interview took place in December and
the studio w a s freezing. Terry-Thomas
strengthened h i s coffee with the contents
of h i s brandy flask.
Another star of Spanish F l y , L e s l i e
P h i l l i p s was interviewed at the C o l l e g e
shortly after. He w a s making a film
c a l l e d 'Not now comrade' outside the
Albert H a l l .
In the last lunchbreak of the Spring
Term Barry Humphries made a second
v i s i t to the T V Studio. T h i s time,
instead of the ubiquitous A u s t r a l i an
Housewife Dame E d n a Everage, we
welcomed the man himself. At the time
Dame E d n a w a s , and s t i l l : i s starring in
" H o u s e w i f e Superstar" i n the West E n d .
T h i s programme which w a s transmitted
live w a s the last to be made i n Room
306, E l e c E n g , the home of the T V studio
since i t s inception nearly 7 years a g o .
The studio i s now being rebuilt in Room
208.
Apart from ' F i l m T a l k ' this year's
other main productions have been weekly
editions of 'LUNCHBREAK' our weekly
magazine programme. Michael W i l l i a m s '
presence as anchor man lent the
programme authority within the C o l l e g e
Troilus Cressida at the Young Vic
Romeo and Juliet the plot concerns
more, at least i n this production, the
challenge of Hector to the G r e e k s ,
taken up by A j a x whilst A c h i l l e s i s
sulking in h i s tent with h i s boyfriend
P a t r o c l u s . There i s a wealth of minor
characters, not least amongst whom
are T r o i l u s , a s o n of P r i a m , K i n g of
T r o y , who loves C r e s s i d a , at a d i s t a n c e ,
and C r e s s i d a , who thinks it might be fun
to encourage h i m . After their night of
buss it i s announced that, in an exchange
with the G r e e k s , C r e s s i d a w i l l be
handed over to be with her father,
C a l c h a s . w h o h a s d e f e c t e d . She immediately
turns her attentions to Dionedes the
Greek commander who carries out the
exchange; unfortunately T o i l u s sees
these advances and the two suitors
meet in battle; what happened next I
found it hard to d i s c e r n !
Robert E d d i s o n plays, the engaging
Pandarus matchmaker between T r o i l u s
and C r e s s i d a , h i s n i e c e . In a delightful
scene he points out to her the heroes as
they pass by in p r o c e s s i o n . T h e r s i t e s
c o u l d be said to be the Touchstone of the
play; P h i l i p Stone draws a fine portrait
of this j o l l y tapster, cutting h i s teeth on
some fine wit with A c h i l l e s and A j a x .
You would be w e l l a d v i s e d to read
up your A e n e i d before you go; a playgoer
near me had to have the plot explained
in loud w h i s p e r s . Fortunately the
costumes do distinguish Trojan from
Greek but it i s helpful to know who's
who beforehand a s a P l e t h o r a of familiar
names p a s s before y o u . T h e programme
does give a short legendary biography of
the characters. What marred the evening
most w a s the late arrival of about fifty
people — the Young V i c i s nolr w e l l
designed for the accommodation of
latecomers — p l e a s e arrive early.
T h e National Student Drama F e s t i v a l

the Roundhouse from 27July to 7 August.
which it h a d l a c k e d during previous
years. E d i t i o n s of note include our
coverage of rag week and a memorable
streak round the Albert H a l l . T h e U n i o n
H u s t i n g s and E l e c t i o n s were covered
l i v e with considerable s u c c e s s . " D e s p i t e
technical limitations, our coverage
doubled the number of people w i t n e s s i n g

L U N C H B R E A K IS R E C O R D E D i s
every Wednesday evening. O n e technical
problem which confronted us last year
was the lack of editing f a c i l i t i e s . F o r
example, when cutting from one item to
the next, the picture would roll furiously
for about ten seconds. T h e C o l l e g e has
recently acquired editing f a c i l i t i e s and
these w i l l improve the technical quality
of our productions, particularily L U N C H !
B R E A K , considerably. Programmes for
next year; w e l l there w i l l be interviews
with G l e n d a J a c k s o n , P e t e r C u s h i n g ,
M e l v i n Frank (director of " A T o u c h of
C l a s s , " " D u c h e s s and Dirtwater F o x " ) .
There w i l l a l s o be a documentary on the
making of A T V ' s S P A C E 999 including
interviews with Gerry Anderson (of
'Thunderbirds' fame), Martin L a n d a u and
Barbara B a i n i n her dressing room and a
look at the s p e c i a l effects.

At last I shall see G a s , L e e d s U n i v e r s i t y ' s
production which w a s s o highly praised
in Edinburgh in A p r i l . The other productions
to be seen are Carp d'Etat ( K e e l e ) ,
G a l a t e a (St Andrews), The Key (Rose
Bruford) and England October 30th
1975 (Central School of A r t and D e s i g n ) .

H e w a s now angry because no one had
told him that everyone was joining up._He
too w a s keen to join s o that he could
take advantage of the Honey H i l l s and
Ice-cream mines. A l i c e s a i d he could

A l i c e then came out of the wood and
suddenly realised that everyone had
forgotten about the dreadful songs they
must put up with in the E E C . A l i c e ,
however, a great lover of E E C M and S
crusty loaves mused that a half baked
song i s better than no bread at a l l .
