Extremist thoughts on Union Management
I N C L U D E D B E L O W are a c o l l e c t i o n
of v i e w s , and questions, which could
make people think what they want from
their U n i o n . Changing the current Union
P o l i c y could lead to a better d e m o c r a c y .
The Student Union
No matter how effective the President
of a U n i o n , i s , it Is almost Inevitable
that there w i l l often only be a s m a l l
number of students interested in Internal/
external p o l i t i c s . A t Imperial C o l l e g e ,
with about 40% post-graduates and about
40% Overseas students, the relevance of
the Union unfortunately tends to be even
less than at other U n i v e r s i t i e s . Union
meetings appear to draw a regular, small
percentage of politically motivated
members. F o r many more students, the
Union only helps fund their a c t i v i t i e s .
Perhaps the majority make little use of
the f a c i l i t i e s , and s o provide a large
pool of resources for the interested few.
One Interesting phenomenon in this
institution is that its members a r e
conservative (small ' c ' ) . T h u s , when an
'extremist' motion Is put to a Union
Meeting it is likely to be heavily defeated.
Union Meetings
Bearing in mind the comments in the

how the U n i o n ' s a c t i v i t i e s c a n be openly

The impefta! C o l l e g e Orienteering
C l u b has only been i n existence since
last October, and it w a s o f f i c i a l l y
recognized by the A t h l e t i c s C l u b
Committee in January of this year.
Since i t s inception, c l u b members have
been competing i n Orienteering ' E v e n t s '
on most Sundays, i n forests a l l over
South of E n g l a n d . In total, members
have competed in over 20 different
events and T O C ' i s now a w e l l know

The club h a s also organised i t s
own events on Wednesday afternoons
for members of I C a n d other L o n d o n
C o l l e g e s . T h e s e have been held on
Hampstead Heath, Richmond P a r k and
Wimbledon Common. T h e c l u b owns 10

newcomers to the sport. It is a group

Federation, and four of the club are
individual members o f B O F .
Only two members o f the club, A l a n
Leakey a n d David R o s e n , ' h a d had any
significant orienteering experience
before the club w a s formed. However,
many of the newcomers are already
producing good results and R o b A l l i n s o n
is w e l l o n the way to achieving a
gold standard. A l a n L e a k e y h a s been
running very c o n s i s t e n t l y , rarely

been having h i s most s u c c e s s f u l

of the South E a s t ' G a l l o p p e n ' , having
won three of the four events.

Union Council
The 'management' of Imperial C o l l e g e
Union Is vested in a committee of about
40 students ( I C U C o u n c i l ) . T h i s may
appear to be .democratic, but C o u n c i l
cannot c l a i m to be representative of
Union Members (Members represent the
bodies who elect them). In many instances
C o u n c i l erupts into e x p l o s i o n s of flippancy,
which are unbecoming to the management
committee.
D e c i s i o n s made by a large group of
people (who have not a l w a y s considered
the full Implication of their voting) may
superficially be democratic, but may not
be in the best interests of the U n i o n .
It is dlffucult for people to hold their
concentration for longer than 2 hours, and
can result in incorrect d e c i s i o n s being
made, which would put C o u n c i l into
disrepute. Y e t , meetings last about 5
hours, and have occured roughly every 3,
weeks during this s e s s i o n . In addition,
the large time committment to attending
the meeting may unfortunately discourage
some students from helping the U n i o n ,
and may a l s o not allow C o u n c i l Members
to adequately read d i s c u s s i o n papers
relevant to issues being considered at
the Meeting.
the L a k e district at E a s t e r , and a week
later, five from the C o l l e g e took part
in the B U S F Championships at Stirling.
Here, D a v i d Rosen won the Individual
race, and the next day w a s a member
of the winning U n i v e r s i t y of London
Team in the relay.
For the next year, the club hopes to
continue to grow and there i s
already news of a keen orienteer coming
to the C o l l e g e next term. L a s t term, we
were fortunate to be able to use the
A C C minibus on three o c c a s i o n s and
there w a s a noticeable improvement i n
club spirit when w e were a l l able to
travel together. It i s hoped that we w i l l
be able to u s e the minibus even more
regularly i n future. We have been
fortunate in gaining a lot o f support
from members o f the cross-country
club and P e t e Johnson i s a member of
both committees. Next year we w i l l
also try to encourage regular partici-
pation by people who are l e s s athletically
minded but who just enjoy a stroll i n
the country. We have h a d very little
response from the women at C o l l e g e
and this i s another group that w e w i l l
be vigorously encouraging.

Slight mis-management of a Union
may be considered democratic, but the
real danger Is that the result can be that
the whole Union management is ignored
by the parties which it seeks to help and
that is not democracy. Reduction of the
s i z e of C o u n c i l and/or an even stricter
control on reports to C o u n c i l (more
Working P a r t i e s , with reports being taken
as read) could greatly improve a situation
which has several times been chaotic
during the last three years!
Committeee Management
I sometimes ponder on a question:
"Why do Intelligent people resort to the
use of Standing Orders to conduct
meetings?" Is this really good democracy,
when some members are distracted
through boredom?
Should a chairman a l w a y s remain
s i l e n t ? Is there supposed to be some
element of discretion s o that the business
can be expedited. Of course, the Chairman
runs the risk of being challenged,
provided that the Committee is alert,
which it should be!
E x e c u t i v e or sub-Committee d e c i s i o n s
should be a c c e p t e d , not d i s c u s s e d
again. However, the power to over-rule
a d e c i s i o n must always be vested in the
superior body.

T H E N E W postgraduate grants for
1976/77 were announced to the Commons
by Mr M u l l e y , Secretary of State for
E d u c a t i o n , on Monday. T h e s e bring the
value of a L o n d o n studentship to £1,380
(previously £1,180). F o r students outside
L o n d o n the new figure is £1,270 (£1,085)
and for t? bse l i v i n g at home £^25 (£790).
In the light, of recent wage restraints
by the Government and the U n i o n s , a
rise of 17% might, at first sight seem
quite reasonable. It is only when one
looks more deeply into these figures that
one r e a l i s e s how criminally l o w they a r e .
L a s t month, new undergraduate ( U G )
figures were announced which gave them
a grant for the next academic year of
£955 for L o n d o n , an 18% r i s e . T h i s i s
1% more than the percentage P G rise.
T h i s i s an insult i n itself, but even more
so when one considers that the U G
grant is already higher than a P G grant
in terms of " r e a l " weekly allowance.
Some reshuffling of U G allowances h a s
been made so that it w i l l not be worthwhile
to c l a i m S o c i a l Security during the
Christmas and Easter vacations.
Even with this taken into account, the
real value of an .UG grant for the 31
week statutory term time w i l l be £27.90
per week. A P G w i l l receive £26.53
over the whole year. When one adds to
this the a v a i l a b i l i t y of demonstrating
which i s restricted, and the fact that
U G s have an opportunity to earn large
amounts during the summer vacation,
the new figures appear even more absurd.
For London students there are extra
difficulties a s the vaSue o f the London
weighting i n percentage terms h a s

One c a n only conclude from these
figures that the Goverment puts less
