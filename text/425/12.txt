Wet going
O N A W E T miserable summers
day last Saturday, five I C
post-graduate cross country
runners descended o n Hamwell
to see the soggy remains of a
carnival p r o c e s s i o n p a s s by.
Someone quietly blew a
whistle which started the
Hanwell C a r n i v a l ' 5 ' , leaving
Pete Johnson and A l a n L e a k e y
standing chatting o n the starting
line. Down to the c a n a l ,
minding the right angle bend
onto a three foot wide bridge
with no handrails over a
backwater, along the tow
path, past some really foul
smelling factory fumes which
would have brought tears to
Mooney's eyes had he been
running this time, up over s i x
l o c k gates to a main road with
a l l that beautiful carbon
monoxide which makes running
so enjoyable, back down to the
c a n a l , past 'Southside' again
and up to the f i n i s h ; a good
five miles! Rob A l l i n s o n a s
always w a s first home i n
4th place in a very good time
of 24.41. Steve Webb running
" a b l i n d e r " w a s 8th, not quite
breaking the 5 minute mile
barrier with 25.08. P a u l
Clarke just recovering from
injury w a s 38th i n 27.30.
Pete Johnson just broke the
s i x minute mile barrier with
29.18 for 58th p l a c e c l o s e l y
followed by A l a n L e a k e y 30.38
in 65th p l a c e . The team was a
very creditable 4th, just
m i s s i n g medals by 10 point's.
It w a s felt that some L o n d o n
Pride w a s needed to settle
our stomachs — so the Dove
was v i s i t e d afterwards. If you
have a thirst and need some
exercise there i s the Horsham
10 followed by the K i n g and
Barnes 10 in the evening on
July 19th; see our Union
notice board for d e t a i l s .
Stop P r e s s
I C ' s Dave West won the 400
metre hurdles in the Southern
Championships last Saturday
at C r y s t a l P a l a c e in the very
fast time of 52.5 s e c . T h e
weekend before he was 4th
in the Olympic T r i a l s for the
same event.
Control 9 takes
its toll
O N S U N D A Y a small party of
three travelled to Thorndon P a r k ,
near Brentwood to take part in
a relay organised by Havering
Orienteering C l u b (usually
referred to a s H A V O C ) .
Traditionally, relay teams
competeunder s i l l y pseudonyms,
and IC have taken this one
stage further by entering the
individual members of the teams
in a similar manner. Thus the
E m p i r i c a l Overshooters team
again featured such stars as
R Braunschultz and L K Seltzer.
Unfortunately no-one could
think up a name w h i c h , in this
clean family sport, was suitable
for A l a n L e a k e y ; he thus ran
under h i s own name, which
was considered to be s i l l y
enough anyway.
The navigation was not
unduly complicated, a good
network of paths, allowing one
to follow ones progress on the
map by running along a path
and counting the number of
other paths which one c r o s s e s .
T h i s c a u s e d problems for R o b
A l l i n s o n , who is incapable of
counting higher than three
while running. A s a result he
spent some time looking for
control seven about 150
metres too far to the north before
r e a l i s i n g h i s mistake. Some
areas of the woods were
covered i n knee-deep ferns and
bracken, which o w i n g to the
morning rain were absolutely
saturated: Control nine, in a
small depression in one of
these areas, w a s particularly
difficult to find, and A l a n
L e a k e y lost nearly 10 minutes
finding this control. The other
team members were more
fortunate here, R o b A l l i n s o n
falling into the depression
while - wandering a i m l e s s l y
through the bracken, and Ian
Isherwood, o n seeing another
orienteer apparently rising
vertically out of the ground,
correctly deduced that this
person must have been v i s i t i n g
the control.
The I C team eventually
finished *5th out of about 20
teams in the C l a s s ' A ' relay.
Rob A l l i n s o n brought them in
6th on the first l e g with a
time of about 39 mins for h i s
5km course; 5 minutes down on
the leaders. Steadily improving
Ian Isherwood pulled the
team up to 5th, with a time of
around 50 mins. A l a n L e a k e y
started off w e l l , and had
moved up to 3rd at one point,
but unfortunately lost both
these p l a c e s at control 9.
He eventually finished with a
time of 44 m i n s , only a few
yards behind the 4th placed
team.
