T H E D E B U T A L B U M from everybody's
favourite perverts has s o far had much
publicity for its supposed outrageousness,
not least by those guardians of public
morality the News of the World and
Sunday People. L e t me keep you in
suspense no longer — everything you
have read about the album (that h a s
already been banned from WH Smiths and
Boots) i s true — w e l l almost. Y e s , there
are plenty of four letter words, y e s the
songs are about s a d i s m , debauchery,
bondage — you name it, the Albertos
cover it (all over).
Could it be that the national press
have finally twigged to the fact that
rock 'n'roll music has gone beyond the
the sweet sixteen syndrome? Obviously
they can't be aware that Frank Z a p p a
said it a l l over a decade ago with
p r i c e l e s s little ditties like 'Brown
Shoes Don't Make It', and as far as
four-letter words g o , hell Lenny Bruce
was laying them down on vinyl a good
Back Street Crawler - Second Street

IT W O U L D be nice to s a y that before
dying so tragically on 18th May this
year, P a u l K o s s o f f left us with a record
that was a monument to R o c k ' n ' R o l l .
S a d l y . this i s not s o , which is not to
say this i s a bad album. In fact i t s an
album which I found quite enjoyable,
although lacking any sort of originality,
(the band having strong leanings toward
sytle of B a d Company, which is inevitable
I suppose) it contains plenty of high
octane energy and feeling, two super-
latives that become mandatory when
describing any work P a u l K o s s o f f was
involved i n .
The band i t s e l f i s tight 'n'hot with
Terry Wilson on bass and Tony PI tunagel
on drums laying down a firm rhythm on
which John 'Rabbit' Bundrick builds h i s
fine keyboard work. T h e n there's ' K o s s '
of course, doing what comes nafurally,
Joe Cocker - Stingray
(A&M)
A F T E R T H E suprisingly up-tempo
approach of the man's last effort, Jamaica
Say You Will, on h i s latest recording,
C o c k e r returns to the more familiar, laid
back mood of / Can Stand A Little Rain.
Recorded in K i n g s t o n , with just about
the most impressive line-up any R & B
singer h a s ever used — the initial band
being C o r n e l l Dupree, E r i c G a l e , Richard
T e e , Steve G a d d and Gordon E d w a r d s ,
with the likes of E r i c Clapton and Bonnie
Bramlett thrown in for good measure, the
album has that distinctive reggae
undercurrent, that seems to infect most
artist's work when they record in
Jamaica.
The album opens with Bobby C h a r l e s
'The Jealous Heart' which C o c k e r sings
while before Frank.
What the nationals failed to grasp
however, i s the main point of A l b e r t o ' s
existence — Satire, the bands particular
folly being 'to take the p i s s out of the
music b u s i n e s s , and more s p e c i f i c a l l y
the musicians who keep it a l i v e . Thev
achieve this with outrageous p a r o d i e s ,
incorporating the above mentioned
lyrical overtones.
I he first track i s 'Tortue You' with its
spade-like heavy breathing, complete with
sensous l y r i c s like 'give me a whip and
a j e l l i e d e e l ' , all good clean fun. L o u
Reed comes under the Alberto's hammer
with 'Anadin', needless to s a y a spoof
of the V e l v e t s 'Heroin'. "Dread Jaws",
the bands reluctant T o p T e n shot, gives
Bob Marley the once over, (substitute
'No Women N o C r y ' with — no legs he
c r y ' ) . 'Pavlov' i s a piece of punk-rock
that would do even the Romones j u s t i c e .
Side T w o opens with the utterly
s i c k 'Dead Meat' whimsical tale about a
lad who yearns to be a butcher and rub
and finally Terry Wilson Slesser singing
up a storm with h i s R o d S t e w a r t / F r a n k i e
Milleresque v o c a l s .
Second Street opens powerfully with
'Selfish Lover' the strong drumming of
Braunagel standing out here. K o s s o f f s
guitar is clear and crisp in the typical
K o s s o f f manner; and the whole band
really works up some heat. 'Blue Soul',
the next c u t , is a melodic blues with
tasteful piano and acoustic guitar,
taking the song along until the band
bursts ' b a c k , with the vocalist bawling
out the lyrics with a lot of energy.
Unfortunately the album nose dives
with the next two songs — 'Stop What
Your Doing' and 'Raging River', which
are straight rockers with little to say
for them, but the last track on the first
side. "Some Kind of Happy" i s a real
in a relatively restrained manner,
compared with sonie of the vocal frenzy
that appears on other parts of this
record. T h e next offering i s one of three
Matthew Moore songs included. 7 broke
down' which proves to be the albums sole
track which shuffles along with any sort
of urgency, the rest being the moody
hiidilv emotional, often unbearably
poignant interpretations that have become
the C o c k e r hallmark.
Inevitably, Bob Dylan is represented
on Stingray, he providing two of the
compositions. One of which, the previously
unrecorded 'Catfish' proving to be the
albums finest p i e c e , with Joe i n fine
v o i c e , and making the most of the
shivering, i c e - c o l d arrangement given to
rawmeat i n his face.
The Albertos reckon "most musicians
s u c k " it says o n the press handout, a n d
the band leave the listener in no doubt
as to whom they think suck the most,
those bastions of moronic musak Hawk-
wind and P i n k F l o y d . During 'Mandrax
Variations — Parts', the band make
direct reference to the music of "wind and
F l o y d , with parts of Silver Machine and
E c h o e s , given new arrangements, and
F o l l o w the Guru' is a disarming step
back into Barretian F l o y d p s y c h e d e l i a .
I could go o n , but I guess you've got a
picture of what this album's a l l about.
My only disappointment with the
record is the sad omission of the a l l
time piss-take that a l w a y s proves a
k i l l e r i n their stage act — the immortal
Captain Beefcake routine, complete with
farting saxophone. T h e Albertos are
really a band to see, but this album i s
the next best thing, y o u ' l l probably get
into it — but your mother wouldn't like it.

creaser, and once again, Wilson-Slesser
is on top form, backed up by a girl
chorus who make this the cut of the
whole album.
The second side opens with 'Sweet
Beauty' — another ballad which i s given
added momentum by the guitar playing
of K o s s .
The remaining tracks - 'Just for You'.
'On Your Life' and 'Leaves in the wind'
are good, but fall into the same catagory
as s o many Free and Bad Company songs.
Nevertheless, despite i t s faults this
record i s an e s s e n t i a l addition to any
c o l l e c t i o n that contains work by either
(or both) of the aforementioned bands, as
it is the last statement by someone who
had more than a passing influence on
both Free and B a d Company, and for that
matter British rock a s a whole.

track i n , and from now on C o c k e r sings
with the rasping, raging intensity that
only this man c a n give to seemingly
romantic songs. A s the second side

if yours i s just a passing interest,try
some of the l e s s intense recordings, like
