FELIX
De IF Only Collum
ONCE AGIN, despite de end o' teim
fateeg I'am reachin' fo' de crayon box
an' gittin' de Big Boys book o' Adjectives
f'om under de short table leg. Trouble
wid dishin' out de amazin' prose an'
politerkal comment (showin' great
unnerstandin') each week is de studes
commin' roun' de fron' door ev'ry Friday
pm yellin' fo' de nex masterpiece. I not
falliri' into de overproduction trap. If I
can't manage to cobble together de
'maculate english fo' de Felics then de
life aint worth .botherin' 'bout. De TP
collum de only thin' wot am makin' de
kew fo' de squash corts tollerable on de
Friday mornin's. I noticin' aftah mah
comments on de efforts bein' printed
f'om de IF chicks dat de standard o'
de aforesaid artikal risin' dramatically
as de truth sinkin' in dwon in Cromwell
Mews. De fear o' de great Pres commin'
roun' t' sort dem out 'avin' mirakeruless
effects on de outputs. Trouble am, not
I enouff emphersis bein' put on de correc'
an' proper use o' english dese days.
Po' a starters, even I noticin de mix up
wid de odd english word croppin' up in
de coloquial froggy. As fo' de 'Pee Ess'
bit tacked on de end, I 'avin' to send it
down de interperators to git de translation,
only to find out it some comment 'bout me.
Strikin' me it a bit. to much like de
dreaded contempt. Time to git de
Presidential Luger out o' de safe deposit
box an' arrestin' de affendin' items wid
de NUS thu gs. Any more o' dis an we
goin' t' 'ave to re-instate de special
tribunerals run by de reliable druncks
font de Union Bar, issued wid de card
sayin', 'Good mornin' miss, I see yo'
am pleadin' guilty. De penalty am death,
but seein' as yo' f'om de famous IF
I willin' to here de excuses an' special
circumstances roun' de back o' de
Gym aftah de hearin'. Alterertaverly, we
bustin' in on de amazin' Julia Ross
while she soakin' in de sunken bath
o' asses milk an' chuckin' de fan heater
in an' turnin' de whole schmozzle into de
giant size milk shake. I not normally in
de habit o' reply in' to de critics on
account o' de fac' dat it beneaf de
diggernity o' us low creative talents to
ascend to de high level o' de oppersition
wot am racked wid de jealosy over de
crappy artikals wot I gen'rally issue
each week.
Not dat de IF got all de visual talent
roun' de college RCS got de Chesty
Morral wid de inderpendant fron' suspen-
sion, Mines got de H Matress, an' de
Guilds got de prize winnin' rag collecter
wid de bum yo' can stand de tea cup on.
Back to business. I noticin' your
Union thinkin' o' rebellin' an' pullin'
outta de LSO, not dat it worry in' de
Andrew Previn an' his banjo band, but
some o' us needin' de cash, not f
mention de prestigue o' controllin' de
IC Union an' de ULU at de same time,
also de numerous other colleges in de
orchestrah. De P Teague am to tight
wid de cash fo' de LSO suberscriptions,
wot ensurin' a years free f'om lef wing
subversion an' visitin' rugby teams
puttin' de boot in. It called protection
in de trade. Anyway, wot five hunered
softees to a big rich union like yo's. On
de other hand, by de time all de different
committees discussed it, like de UFG,
ICU UGM, de RCC, SCAB, ACC, SCC,
CCU, AAC, UFO, an' such like I not
Surprised yo' reluctant to give it to me.
Judgin' by de amounts o' alcohol consumed
at de all-night Counsel meetin's, it am
a wunder to me dat yo' can come to any
descissions at all, even wid holdin' de
vote in de khazi.
Thinkin' o' takin' de holiday to get
away f'om all de tension but I y'am
wunderin' 'bout de reliability o' de
NUF Travel Service. I would feel
happier if dey'd let me on de flight
deck pussonly to check dat de navegater
got de AA continental handbook open at
de right page fo' sunny Barcerlona an' a
newly magnitized nittin' needal in de
compass. Also dat de pilot got de
handbook open de right way up. Las'
year I aimin' to Trinidad but endin' up
in Prestwick aftah de good engin'
packin' up on de NUS Charter Dakota. De
Stewerdess stuff not much good either,
we not gittin' de tastefull Martinis an' de
prawn salads served at de beck an'
call, all dey managin' is de pile o' ready
wrapped sarnies tossed out o' de
cardbord box. I dunno. Might be better
stickin' to de Coconut Airways aftah all.
I hearin' nasty rumours bein' put roun'
by people wid moufs wot am so big as
to be hazerdous to de healf. Dey sayin'
de revoltin' Rick Perker am churnin' out
dese gramatical goodies, well, he can't
sharpen his pencel widdout causin'
multiple lasserations to de fingers, an
as fo* suggestions dat de P Teague
writin' it, I sayin' cobblers, he could n't
even keep de Peters Patter collum goin'
fo' more dan 2 weeks. De controversy am
over. De mighty lips am sealed an' it
likely dat dis am de lars' artikal wot I
cobblin' together fo' de Felics. It
never really 'predated. D E Pong an'
D Susss guy always missin' out de
vital lines an 'addin' de misprints an'
such like. I thinkin' de proof readers
Trevor Phillips: ICU President 1974-7?
only botherin' w i d de head lines a n ' de
page numbers. I s i c k a n ' tired o' d i s h i n '
out de threats to improve de standard o '
vari-typin'. T h i s time it am fo' r e a l . I
commin' roun' de F e l i c s offices nex
Tuesday to do a few irrepairable
adjustments to de off set litho a n '
tie a few knots in de proof readers
fingers.
Well, I off fo' de quiet game o' darts
in de Union B a r , den back o n de 14
bus fo' downtown Holborn, now where
am de blowpipe?

Alice through the E E C
. ONE DAY ALICE happened, just to be
climbing up a steep, steep wooded
mountainside. She took out her pocket
television set and saw that Mr Wilson
(ie Callaghan) was about to hold a
referendum on the Eurovision Song
Contest — could we bear the excrutiating
pain of it each year anTi could Cliff
Richard still go on representing us now
that he is an OAP?
Alice realised this would have a
direct bearing on the Marche Commun, in
which, she felt, we must remain.
However, she came across Le Tigre
Presque Mort and was very concerned,
seeing as she had campaigned vehemently
to stop the IC1 from giving dogs cigarettes
to smoke! She wept'buckets and tears and
asked the Tigre why he was nearly
dead. He managed to stutter a few words
"The c.. c... Contest.,.c... cruelty", of
course Alice immediately linked this
with the subject of the Referendum and
rang up the RSPCA to enquire whether
such singing could have such a drastic
effect on animals. She used a trunk call,
naturally, because she was in a forest —
the line was engaged.
A few steps further on she began to
hear music "How sweet", she thought,
"A Christmas carol". But soon, soon the
dreadful truth filtered through. It w a s the
German team flexing their v o c a l chords
for the contest with ' O Tannenbaum'.
Horror upon horrors in true song contest
style each team had decided to copy
each other, hence the French version
'Mon B e a u Sapin'. T h e whole wood
resounded with the dreadful cacophony, so
A l i c e sang the ' R e d F l a g ' like a good
S o c i a l i s t and a l s o because it happens to
be the same tune.
She then tried the straight line test
which indicates whether one h a s lost
one's equilibrium due to horrendous
noises — she f a i l e d miserably. L e t there
be a moral there.
A s you have probably guessed, the
mountain was an E E C Butter mountain and
so it w i l l not surprise y o u that soon s h e
came upon an E E C Wine L a k e . What will
surprise y o u i s that there w a s a R e d
Indian s a i l i n g or canoeing on it! E x p l a n a -
tions wered needed. "Big.chief-jam-butty-
say-much-bitter-for-buttis-in-european-
b u t t y - c i u b " ( E E C to intellectuals). E e k
by Gum! exclaimed A l i c e , as she learnt
that everyone w a s now i n the E E C .
Except L e T i g r e Presque Mort, who had
just decided to stop playing s i l l y - b i l l i e s .
