The long hard year
The e n d of a long, hard year looms
pleasingly ahead as I put pen to paper for
the last editorial of the s e s s i o n . It i s not
with sobs and sniffles that I look forward
to my imminent departure a s editor of
this paper, but with a s i g h of relief.
U n l i k e my predecessor I do not w i s h
to epilogue at length. I hope that my
s u c c e s s o r has, or if he h a s not yet done
s o , w i l l learn from the mistakes I made.
F E L I X I believe i s now firmly established
in i t s present form and I hope it continues
to play i t s important role within the
Union i n a responsible and constructive
manner.
That off my chest I should l i k e to
thank a l l those people who have helped
me throughout the year e s p e c i a l l y J e n
Hardy-Smith, R i z Shakir, P e t e r T e a g u e ,
John Downs (despite h i s insults) and
the P u b l i c a t i o n s department of c o l l e g e .
I cannot depart however, without a few
comments about the F E L I X staff who
have worked solidly throughout the year
with almost Spartan-like fervour. They are:
Ian Morse (offset litho operator), for
whom women are o b s t a c l e s to be sur»
mounted a n d who thinks Q P R are the
best football team around; G i l l M c C o n w a y
a sports fanatic whose pet hates are
Mooney food a n d b a d handwriting; P h i l
Dean, who l i v e s more i n B e x h i l l and
did not often get past the office on the
way to the P h y s i c s dept; Terry Westoby,
our Arts E d i t o r who swears he never
edited anything; Duncan S u s s , a Mancunian
with a wry sense of humour and could
screw money out of Scrooge; N i g e l
W i l l i a m s , whose grey photos always sent
P h i l and Ian up the w a l l ; D a v e K n i g h t s ,
who talks and laughs in seven different
octaves; Dave F o x a l l , who p o s s e s s e s
the most extensive vocabulary of abuse
I've ever come across and eats like a
horse; John M c C l o s k e y , a n Abbott a l e
freak whose ambition i s to own a motorbike
shop and thinks that puking i s therapeutic;
C l i v e Dewey, who h a s a penchant for
C o l l e g e admin birds and h a s a very
springy head; T o m Stevenson, who c a n
make F E L I X sound l i k e The Times
over the phone and hates me headlining
his reviews; Andrew H a l l , literary Sports
Editor who never seemed to quite
understand how I became editor;
C h r i s Simester (alias H i e ) , who coughed
up a lot of reviews again this year; a n d
finally Dave H o p k i n s , our Welsh News
Editor who i s sometimes found singing
crude rugby songs over the internal-
extensions in the F E L I X office.
L a s t but by no means l e a s t , a very
special thank y o u to my C R I T I C S — may
they live long and w e l l .

y a l u e on P G education than on U G
education. After three years on a U G
grant P G s are expected to take a further
cut in l i v i n g standards f a a further
three or more y e a r s . It would not be
surprising if the demand for research
p l a c e s dropped and s t i l l l e s s so if the
Government used this as an excuse
for further c u t s . I am sure no P G expects
nor needs a financial incentive to do the
work he or she d o e s , but the financial
deterrent of the present l e v e l of financing
requires a lot of enthusiasm and dedication
to beat it. In future, this l e v e l of sub-
sistence w i l l be tolerated by an ever
d i m i s h i n g , if dedicated, f e w .
It i s hardly surprising that many
good graduates opt for industry where
they c a n earn £2,500 to £3,500 or more
in their first year, often having the
opportunity to obtain hgher qualifications
and"degrees at the same time.
The 17% rise in grants represents only
an 11% rise in the expenditure on
studentships. T h e total i s already low at
£24 m i l l i o n s , l e s s than the amount any
good nationalised industry can l o s e in a
week.
R e s e a r c h a n d post degree education
are the core of our education system. We
rely on these sectors to train our
lecturers and those researchers w h o
constantly refresh a n d advance the
body of knowledge a v a i l a b l e . T h e
Government is restricting the flow to the
core. Soon the education system w i l l be
a hollow s h e l l following stagnant
patterns.
STOP THE ROT NOW!
