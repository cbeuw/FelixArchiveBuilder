Chemical Arson-
The Truth
(See F E L I X No. 408 about the story of the truant who tried to
burn down the Chemistry Building.)
L a s t weeks attempt to burn down the Harwood lab w a s
greeted with waves of apathy from the occupants of the lab.
The would-be fire bug was roundly condemned, the following
comments are typical —
"We should have let the whole bloody thing burn d o w n . "
" H e shouldn't have set fire to it, he could have pushed
it d o w n . "
I can now reveal that the man behind the arson attempt
was none other than Dr 'Godfather' Kirkbright, the top man
in analytical chemistry.
The doctor gave the following statements at various
times —
" M a k e an appointment."
' 'Sorry must r u s h . "
" I ' m due at a m e e t i n g . "
" N o I'm not the 'Mr B i g ' behind this arson attempt, even
though we have .run out of money for the new chemistry
b l o c k . "
" N o that was not me moving an opto-acoustic spectrometer
back into the building after Dr F l e e t had foiled the arson
attempt."
The youth responsible was of course Dr A d a m s , d i s g u i s e d
in dark g l a s s e s . Dr Adams is No. 2 in the Kirkbright 'Brother-
hood' (or should it be the Personhood?)

Dr Kirkbright is currently working on the a n a l y s i s o f

Monster hunt at
Loch Morar
Students who attended T i m
D i n s d a l e ' s talk on 'The
Case for the Loch Ness
Monster' (IC Natural History
S o c ) , w i l l recall that help
is needed for this year's
hunt. L o c h Morar has a similar
'monster' tradition to L o c h
N e s s , and a l s o has the
advantage of crystal clear
water for much improved
underwater work. The 1976
L o c h Morar E x p e d i t i o n is
being run by members of
R o y a l Holloway C o l l e g e ,
a s s i s t e d by students from
E a l i n g T e c h , and elsewhere.
More participants are required
for the expedition, which w i l l
run through June, J u l y , and
August. Whatever your personal
v i e w s on the presence or
absence of 'monsters' in
Scottish l o c h s , you may be
attracted by the idea of
spending a week or two in
the highlands this year. Mike
Parsons of R o y a l Holloway is
organising student membership
in London, and I have received
copies of the expedition's
application forms and 1975
report for distribution amongst
interested parties. T h e s e can
be obtained from myself —
