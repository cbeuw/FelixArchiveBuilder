Catherine Howe: Silent Mother
Nature (RCA)
When I first listened to this album I
must admit that it made very little
impression on me and I tended to d i s m i s s
as y e t another piece of v i n y l . However, I
am rapidly revising my opinion after
listening to it a couple of more times.
A l l the songs on the album are written
and sung by Ms Howe and a l l credit to her
for putting down such marvellous l y r i c s .
She a l s o s i n g s them beautifully and indeed
the album is very wejl produced.
She has a style that i s somewhat
akin to that of Carly Simon although she
is p o s s i b l y not a s powerful *a singer a s
Ms Simon.
Of the actual tracks on the album,
"Freedom Enough", "It Took My Breath
Away" and the title track "Silent
Nature" are outstanding on s i d e o n e .
The first h a s a very catchy rythm and
Ms Howe s i n g s with delight and gay
abondon; her concert piano playing
together with P a u l K e o g h ' s electric
guitar combine to give a good effect in
matching with her v o c a l s .
Her vocal talent are, however, not
really revealed until the title track i n
which she covers the full range of chords.
The second side of the album continues
in the same pleasant vein as side one
with "All The Music In Me" the best
track. A g a i n , a lot of rythm i s expressed
in this tune and there i s a c r i s p , clear
flute solo by P e t e r Z o r n . T h e rythm
changes and picks up half way through
the track — another flute solo backed by
a fast percussion that trails off at the end
of the track.
Whether M s Howe w i l l get the
recognition s h e deserves remains to be
seen with C a p i t a l R a d i o ' s Mike A l l e n
plugging her, she would appear to be i n
with a chance. Anyway, I liked the album
and if y o u are looking for some easy
listening then this album i s recommended.
Kool and The Gang - Love
and Understanding
(Polydor)
Kool and The Gang are a band that
have consistently failed to impress me
with their style of m u s i c . It's not that I
don't like the particular m u s i c a l genre to
which their m u s i c belongs. It's just the
a w f u i j n e s s they make of the whole thing.
On the other hand this criticism might
seem unfair s i n c e the apparently received
no m u s i c a l training whatsoever. A l l I
can say i s , tough bananas.
A n y w a y , onto the album itself. It
k i c k s off w i t h the title track "Love and
Understanding" which despite its good
pieces manages to be too long and
slightly overbearing —. i t ' s nearly ten
minutes long. B u t , typically of the band,
the next track, "Sugar", i s a beautiful
combination of the bandls m u s i c a l
talent. T h e backing v o c a l s by Tomorrow's
E d i t i o n and Something Sweet really set
off this track beautifully. It a l s o contains
a rather nice alto s a x solo by Dennis
Thomas.
T h i s track i s followed by "Do It Right
Now", a brassy sounding tune which i s
followed by a equally cheap sounding
track c a l l e d "Cosmic Energy". " C o s m i c
. E n e r g y " i s the sort of music that C a p i t a l
RadTo's Greig Edwards delights i n
playing with a gusto that I always find
a bit nauseating.
The only track on side two - worth
mentioningis "Summer Madness" w h i c h ,
as with the track preceding and that
following it, w a s recorded live at the
Rainbow Theatre. It i s a beautifully
melodic tune tinged with a light delicate
percussion. It features a good piece of
arp playing by R o n a l d B e l l . A l l in a l l ,
though, a rather disappointing album
from the Gang. I look forward with
anticipation to a time when they really
get and produce an album worth listening
to i n i t s entirity.
The Steve Gibbons Band - Any
Road Up (Polydor).
L e d by Steve G i b b o n s , a man the
publicity bumph describe as a " p o e t ,
story teller and third generation rock'n'
r o l l e r " , the Steve Gibbons Band are a
five-piece band who have been around
for about three years now. They play
what I c a n only describe a s agressive
rock but not in such a way a s to be
ostentations or gross.
The c l e a r , precise v o c a l s of Gibbons
is supoorted by the twin lead guitars of
ex—Move man Trevor .JBIuxton and the
drums of B o b L a m b .
T h i s i s the band's first album and
quite frankly for a debut album, it is
astonishingly good. T h e album moves
from a l l rock time "Take Me Home"
thorough a ballad type rock "Johnny
Cqpl" to the more conventional, slightly
commercial tune "Spark of Love".
They are a band with originality and
style of their own. The best comparison
one could make would be to s a y that
m u s i c a l l y , they were somewhere between
the Who and B a d Company. They are not
as loud and heavy as B a d Company but
tend, in my opinion, have to the Who
although in the same m u s i c a l style. It i s
interesting to note that the album i s
released on Roger D a l trey's Goldhawke
L a b e l .
Yet despite the influence that the
Who might exert o n them, the individuality
of the band still holds firm and shines
through in the personality of Steve
Gibbons.
I shall go on about how good the
tracks on side two are because that would
take pages and pages — if you want to
enjoy some bloody good music don't just
sit there are read this, go out and buy the
album now and discover for yourself the
new phenomenon in rock known a s the
Steve Gibbons Band. p M J L E K P E N Y O N G
C A R P E N T E R S : ' T h e r e ' s a K i n d of Hush*
(A&M Records A M L K 64581)
There's a rumour going around record
company c i r c l e s that the profits on the
Carpenters' records pay for A & M ' s
entire U K operations. True or false, the
Carpenters s t i l l sell a lot of records and
no doubt their new album w i l l prove to
be no exception.
Y e s girls and boys you c a n get your
hankies out, the Carpenters are i n town
again with a soppy sentimental and
romantic album that mummy definitely,
would approve of.
The Carpenters, whose mode of
unpretentious Middle of the Road music
appeals to a l l and sundry, have produced
another fine effort that exudes beautiful
harmonies, excellent orchestration and
arrangement (by Richard Carpenter") and
all-round technical perfection. ' H u s h '
is certain not to disappoint many, yet
compared to some of their previous
efforts, notably ' N o w and T h e n ' , the
album lacks some of that charisma that
I've come to expect from Richard and
Karen.
In short ' H u s h ' is likely to appeal to
an avid Carpenters fan who already has
many of the duo's part offerings, whereas
the newcomer would be best advised to
purchase one of the Carpenters' previous
offerings.
One point that does bug me with
' H u s h ' i s why the Carpenters don't
song more of their o w n compositions.
Out of the ten songs on the album only
three, 7 Need to be in Love, Sandy, and
/ Have You are penned by Richard
Carpenter and l y r i c i s t John B e t t i s .
Yet the Carpenters e x c e l much more on
their own material than they do o n other
peoples. A n d they don't make bad
versions of the latter! F o r starters y o u
have a splendid reworking of N e i l
Sedaka's Breaking Up is Hard to do in a
happy 5 0 ' s rendition set against a
marvellous string arrangement. J a c k i e
De Shannon's Boat to Sail and Randy
E d e l m a n ' s Y.ou aren't far behind either!
In a l l then a rather moody, sometimes
pensive, album that won't disappoint,
but i s more for Carpenters fans than
newcomers to their world.
C L I V E D E W E Y
Cinema
" S A T U R D A Y N I G H T A T T H E B A T H S " ,
directed by David B u c k l e y ; starring
Robert Aberdeen, E l l e n Sheppard and
Don Scotti.
W H A T E V E R T H E original intentions were
with regard to the making of this film,
the end result i s a badly made soft core
porno. Y o u know, the sort of porn, • like
L a s t Tango in P a r i s or Emmanuelle where
the deep s i g n i f i c a n c e of what is trying
to be said i s submerged by technical
meanderings and hazy and unnecessary
diversionary side plots of very little
value.
Michael (Robert Aberdeen) i s a n out
of work pianist who eventually finds a
job in club run for homosexuals and
l e s b i a n s . Scotti (Don Scotti) i s the
compere at the club and needless to s a y ,
is a homosexual and T r a c y ( E l l e n
Sheppard) i s M i c h a e l ' s photographer
girlfriend..
On h i s opening night, Michael refuses
to allow Tracy to attend the show. When
the show is finally over he goes out for
a stroll with Scotti and hey presto, they
are i n bed making iove — the way in
which the whole thing is presented
suffers from the flippant attitude of "I
told you s o (re homosexual tendencies),
didn't I".
He then goes to meet h i s girl friend
at her studio' and in not so many words
she finds out that he made i t with S c o t t i .
Just at the point when one would
expect the story to really begin to
develop it stops. It's finished. The
director has finally exhausted himself
after 90 minutes.
If Mr B u c k l e y was trying to tell us
how hypocritical about s e x people a r e ,
even the self proclaimed liberals, then
it w a s not h i s fault that the message
seeped through. Anyway, do we not know
this already? Surely the full import of a
guy making love to h i s girl friend and
then to a homosexual i s that he can love
both the male and female of h i s s p e c i e s .
T h i s tedious film has only one
moment of sparkle in it. That i s when
the " s t r a i g h t s " meet the " g a y s " i n a
football match (American football, of
course!) I shall leave the game to
your imagination.
