Fromonediscrimination
to another OVERSEAS
STUDENTS FEES
T H E J O I N T W O R K I N G Party
of the C V C P and U G C has come
out firmly against fee
differentials between home and
overseas students (OS) in i t s
final report published this
week. Instead, they c a l l for
a fee differential between
full-time postgraduates and
undergraduates.
On the b a s i s of this
proposal, tuition fees for
full-time university students
would be levied at £250 for
undergraduates and £450 for
postgraduates in 1977/78.
The reports also c a l l s on
universities to contain, by
voluntary agreement, the
present open-ended commitment
on O S . T h e limitation of OS
would be made between a
university and the U G C
according to the university's
need.
T h i s would in effect stop
universities from making up
their numbers with O S . C o l l e g e s
such as I C which had large
numbers of O S would keep to
their present l e v e l s of O S
intake and would therefore
not suffer under this proposal.
The choice of discrimination
is described by Sir B r i a n
F l o w e r s as " r e a s o n a b l e and
certainly u n d e n i a b l e " .
Sir Brian went to comment:
" O v e r s e a s students are a
strain on the taxpayers and a
heavy one at the moment.
Given the present circum-
stances, we ought to accept
voluntary restraint and run the
risk of discrimination between
undergraduates and post-
g r a d u a t e s " .
" I f one complains too much
then the choice is between
higher fees for postgraduates
and something much w o r s e " ,
he added.
F o r those P G s who are
a l s o overseas students the
Working P a r t y ' s fees proposal
means that although they w i l l
not be much better off, they
certainly w i l l not be -much
worse off.

Flowers
on power
IN A MAJOR speech, at
Tuesday's National Energy
Conference in London, the
Rector, Sir Brian Flowers,
expressed considerable anxiety
about proposals to develop a
fast breeder reactor system
as the basis for Britain's
nuclear power stations.
Sir B r i a n , who is Chairman
of the Royal C o m m i s s i o n on
Environmental Protection, w a s
speaking prior to the p u b l i c a t i o n
of the C o m m i s s i o n ' s report on
the environmental hazards of
the nuclear power industry.
In h i s opening remarks the
Rector said that the C o m m i s s i o n
accepted that nuclear power
offered the possibility of much
l e s s pollution than conventional
power stations. However they
feH'that nobody should rely for
something as basic as energy
on a process that produces in
quantity a by-product as
dangerous as plutonium unless
he is absolutely convinced
that there is no reasonable
alternative course of action.
I am bound to say that we have
not been wholly convinced that
this is the case by the
evidence sumbitted to us'
T h e Rector then outlined the
awkward d i s p o s a l problems of
Plutonium arising because of
its long radio-active life.
17% for PGs
A V E R A G E I N C R E A S E S of 17%
in the postgraduate grants for
the next s e s s i o n were announced

E d u c a t i o n , Mr Mulley, on
Monday i n the House of
Commons. T h e new grant l e v e l s
