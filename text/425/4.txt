About Mooney Food? Union officials
Sir, - A s I left the Union
Lower Refectory last Thursday
(27th May, 3.35pm approx.)
with, in one hand, my (late)
dinner, which I had just
purchased, to go into the
Lower Lounge where a friend
was waiting for me, I noticed
a pool of water on the foyer
floor. To my amazement I
found that I was standing in
it, and it was growing larger
by the second, being supplied
by a fire hose. The one end of
this hose was connected to
the water supply; at the other
was a member of the G u i l d s
Union(!) Naturally, my food
became rather dampened by
this not too pleasant experience;
and I, not finding the
refectory's culinary status the
peak of a gourmet's delight
at the best of times, certainly
was not going to eat its
produce after the whole
bloody plate had been
waterlogged.
I requested that the person
directly responsible for the
aquatic events buy me another
plate of sausage and c h i p s .
He refused. I pointed out
that the originals were now a
good deal moister and about
60 degrees colder than
previously. He s t i l l refused,
but said that, and I quote,
"they look alright to m e . "
He then, along with other
members of his company,
proceeded to eat some of the
chips, and the sausage,
maintaining that they were
" O . K . " .
Amongst his confederates
at the time were Messrs
A h l e r s , H o y l e , and Dearing,
to name the most recognisable
ones, the three presidents
(past, present, and future,
so to speak) of the illustrious
G u i l d s U n i o n , who all seemed
to view the incident as
being humourous. N o doubt I
too would have found it
funny if I had been pissed out
of my head.
I, however, was sober
and hungry and wet. And not
being in the least bit keen on
wet, cold refectory c h i p s ,
was merely p i s s e d off.
I remain, hungrily, yours,
IVOR P L A T O R - S O G G Y C H I P S
Re: FELIX DINNER
Dear Moron,
I dont mind not getting a
complimentary to your annual
abortion, but I do object to
being referred to as " Y o u r
H e n c h m a n " e s p e c i a l l y as
it was only through me that
you got a bloody guest speaker
in the first bloody place. 1
hope you get an unexploded
frankfurter in your bloody meal.
And if you think for one moment
that this error can be alleviated
by your coming whining to my
door craving forgiveness,
you've got another thing
coming.
I fart in your general
direction.
Y o u r s ,
L U I G I .

A s your lithe supple brain

I B e l i e v e in Schrodinger, the Physicist Almighty.
Equator of Eigenfunctions and waves,
And in his only equation incorporating Del squared P s i ,
Which was conceived in the bath, borne onto virgin paper,
Suffered under differential Calculus, was formulated, equated, and solved,
It failed under relativity; but on the third day it rose again,
And transcended Classical Mechanics,
And sitteth at the centre of Atomic Physics with solutions weighty.
From whence it will come to fox the quick and the slow.
I Believe in the Royal Society, the Royal College of Science, the commutation of observable.
The analyses of four vectors, the radiation of a Black Body and the functions everlasting
Amen
From the "Author" of ' T H E C R E E D ' Comes:
A silly Soliloquy of Shakespeare, for Tired and Torpid Followers of Physics.
Hamlet:
Div D or not Div D — that is the question;
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The reflections and translations of outrageous lattices,
Or to take ions against a cell of atoms,
And by transposing end them? to ionize, to excite —
No more; and by an excitation to say we add
The energies and the thousand thermal shocks
That matter is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To Ionize, to excite;
To excite, perchance to plasma. Ay there's the rub;
For in that excitation of ions what plasmas may form,
When we have shuffled off this magnet's coil, Gerald Taranto II
Must give us 'Gauss'. Soc Sec 'GAD Soc'.
