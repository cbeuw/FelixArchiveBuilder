Working to create a truly global
university
Last week’s Race Disparity Report revealed how BME students are being let
down by a culture of racism – and it’s time Imperial addressed this.

ust last week, the
government released
its sixty-odd page
Race Disparity
Report, commissioned
by the Prime Minister
Theresa May early on
in her tenure. The main
takeaway, as the report’s
name handily notes,
was the general trend of
disparity between minor-
ity experiences across the
board: from education and
housing to employment
and health.
The ‘shock’ revelation
that that Britain could be
institutionally racist would
likely fail the plagiarism
test on Turnitin. This is no
novel conclusion here – in
fact, this isn’t even the
first report this decade
to say this (we do live in
the centre of the former
Empire).
One part of the report
notes that some ethnic
minority students outper-
form their white counter-
parts in attainment levels
in compulsory education
(GCSEs). Interestingly,
this doesn’t necessarily
translate to further edu-
cation – studies of UK
universities imply an
attainment gap in terms
of university performance
across the UK with respect
to ethnicity. On top of this,
curricula often lack an
inclusive approach – the
recent changes to the
Oxford history course
come to mind.
Here at Imperial,
though, raising these kinds
of concerns can often be
tricky: as a STEM uni-
versity, excuses like ‘race
has no place in science’
and ‘we don’t do that
humanities b***s***’ are
very much used in order
to avoid conversations
that are necessary for the
College to improve.
One of the more fash-
ionable excuses is the
inability to see race (‘I
don’t see colour’), usually
done in an attempt at ap-
peasement. This, though
well-meaning, can be the
worst thing to do – refusing
to notice or acknowledge a
person’s race and ethnicity
is in effect wilfully erasing
part of their identity.
This ability to complete-
ly ignore race in a situation
is in itself something that
can only be afforded to
people for whom race has
no impact on their way of
life – for many, their life
experiences are defined
by not just their cultural
background, but the
awareness of being ‘other’
in their home community.
Sadly, wilful ignorance of
this sort is why we often
describe racism in the
UK as being institutional;
it arises from apathy as
opposed to action.
The College’s mission
statement and vision
incorporate the notion of
being not just a world-
class university, but a
global one. But how can
we claim to be such an
institution when the uni-
versity isn’t reflective of
the globe?
This is not implying
that Imperial must
suddenly and abruptly
change its admissions
policies to ensure equal
representation of ‘the
races’ according to global
standards (that borders on
positive discrimination,
which by the way is illegal
in the UK), but we do need
to reconsider how we are
perceived, how we engage
prospective students, and
how we facilitate current
students’ experiences in
striving for this excel-
lence.

Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
I
t’s rather tricky to run for a position that
isn’t well defined – earlier this year, while
campaigning for the role of BME Officer,
more often than not I’d have to explain
what the whole acronym meant (for those
of you who still don’t know, that’s Black and
Minority Ethnic); even then I’d have to try to
explain what this role is meant to be.
Now, the observant amongst you smart
Imperial students might have noticed that
the general campus flavour is somewhat
comparable to Becky’s ‘roast chicken’. That
isn’t at all reflective of global excellence, and,
as such, the views of students from ethnic
minorities can often be overshadowed.
AsaLiberationOfficer,myprimaryroleisto
ensure those underrepresented at Imperial
are heard equally; that their concerns are
put to the Union as equally as those from
any other part of the world – whether it be
dealing with poorly named events (side-eye
to slave auctions) or occasionally switching
the music up in Metric.
First on the agenda: Black History
Month. Seeing as 2017 marks 30 years of
its establishment, I, along with the African
Caribbean Society (ACS), Imperial As One
(the staff BME network), and the Union, have
been planning numerous events on campus.
Every Wednesday this month the QTR
and SCR have prepared a dish inspired by
black cultures around the world (you’ve still
got a week to try them out – get you some
spice in your life); we’ve hosted the award-
winning rapper and activist Akala speaking
here at Imperial; and yesterday ACS hosted
another talk on the history of pre-slave trade
Africa. There’s also the College Black History
Lecture to look forward to next Friday.
Of course, my focus up till now has around
black students, but that’s not the totality
of my liberation zone: each culture here
at Imperial is unique and deserves to be
showcased and celebrated – it’s my aim to
facilitate that.
