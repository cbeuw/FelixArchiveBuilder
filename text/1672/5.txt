Austria’s far-right achieves a landslide win in
parliamentary elections

I
t was a long Sunday
for those eagerly
awaiting the outcome
of Austria’s 26th
parliamentary elections.
When the results started
to come in during early
afternoon, the winner
was clear: the right wing,
31.5% of the votes – 7.6%
more than they received
in the last elections. The
social democratic party
(SPÖ) under Christian
Kern came second with
26.9%, just ahead of the
right-wing nationalist free-
dom party (FPÖ), which
got 26.0% (an increase
of 5.5%). The neoliberal
NEOS came fourth with
5.2%, followed by Liste
Pilz with 4.4%. The Green
Party came last with only
3.8% (down 8.7%).
The success of the ÖVP
comes as no surprise.
Kurz, who took over the
ÖVP from Reinhold Mit-
terlehner in spring, used
recent political instability
to his advantage. With
his radical revamp of the
dusty, old ÖVP he attract-
ed voters from both sides
of the political spectrum
and mobilised non-vot-
ers. Two years after he
began gaining popularity,
31-year-old Kurz is set
to become the world’s
youngest government
leader. In his first public
statement after the election
he said he “has been given
a great responsibility” and
that he “wants to establish
a new political style”.
Another winner was
the FPÖ under Heinz
Christian Strache. It is
“The success
of the right-
wing ÖVP, who
increased their
vote share by
7.6%, comes as
no surprise”
“The future
of the Green
Party is
uncertain: if
they fail to
reach 4% of
the vote share
they will lose
their seats”
the best result for the
party since right-wing
populist Jörg Haider led
the party to second place
in parliamentary elections
in 1999, and the second
best since 1945. With
populist slogans like “Safe
borders, safe homeland!”
and “Austria deserves
fairness!” the FPÖ was
particularly successful in
rural areas and won over
the working class, which
President, subsequent
chaos and poor leadership
repelled voters (see our
coverage in Felix 1671).
Members of the Green
Party also blame their
defeat on the loss of Peter
Pilz. After being removed
from the Green Party’s list
of parliamentary candi-
dates, Pilz ran for govern-
ment with Liste Pilz, his
newly formed party. Pilz
told Austrian newspaper
Profil: “The Green Party
have a new beginning
and a phase of renewal
ahead of them. They are
entirely responsible for
themselves.”
At the time of writing,
with 3.9% of votes yet
to be counted, the future
of the Green Party is
uncertain. If they fail to
increase their vote share
to 4% they will lose
their place in parliament.
The majority of people
working for the Green
Party on a federal level
would be dismissed and
the party would lose €8.2
million of funding. Green
Party candidate Updike
Lunacek said: “This is the
worst crisis of the Green
movement in Austria since
its founding.”
Who will form the
next government is still
an open question. Strache
is hungry for power and
wants to see his party in
the government. The odds
on a far-right coalition
between the ÖVP and
FPÖ are good. The parties
became considerably
closer on the campaign
trail and frequently agree
on policy.
The SPÖ, meanwhile, is
split into two wings. One
favours a coalition with
the FPÖ, while the other,
led by influential mayor of
Vienna Michael Häupl, is
strictly against talks with
the ÖVP. In any case it
would be hard to justify
another coalition between
ÖVP and SPÖ, since this
combination has been
proven to be dysfunctional
more than once and has
been the main reason for
early re-elections this year.
At the moment all signs
point to the nightmare of
many people on the left
in Austria: a right-wing
coalition between ÖVP
and FPÖ.

Those on the left
in Austria are left
dissapointed as a
right-wing coalition
seems likely.
