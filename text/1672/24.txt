Rugby season kicks off against Reading University
F
irst game back for
Imperial’s finest,
first big challenge
of the season as
they took on last year’s
league winners: Reading.
Last year’s outing against
this team is remembered
as a sore loss to a side
that was superior in every
way. This week, Imperial
was keen to avoid a sim-
ilar situation and prove
to the league that a fresh
Imperial side was here to
compete.
With the return of many
players from injuries,
notably Club Captain
Toby “the sling” Simpson,
our first team looked more
than ready to do exactly
that. Fortress Harlington
was blessed with its ideal
playing conditions: slight
drizzle and 20 mph winds
for the boys. First half with
the wind in their faces,
Imperial conceded a quick
try within 5 minutes of
play after sloppy handling
and defence. However,
the boys quickly regained
their cool and worked
their way up to field,
putting pressure on the
Reading defence to finally
force a penalty in front
of the posts, perfectly
converted by small wave
surfer James Field. On the
ensuing restart however,
the 6ft6 Toby tower
tumbled onto his spare
shoulder and was ruled out
of the game. Quick substi-
tution and sloppy hands
ensued, eventually leading
to another silly try from
sneaky Reading. During
this time, crystal expert
Ali Zed was subjected to a
nice knee to the face and
was consequently escorted
to the bench, leaving
Imperial without two of its
main starters. However,
in similar fashion to the
previous time, Imperial
gained terrain and once
again converted a well-
earned penalty right on
half time.
With the wind in their
backs, the second half
looked more promising
for the boys. Quick attacks
and good play gave the
upper hand to Imperial
at the start of the half but
they struggled to cash in.
A potential breakthrough
almost occurred when
resident gimp Marin
Tuleu flew through the
air to catch a high ball in
the opposing 22. Upon an
almost perfect reception,
the man decides to drop
the ball in front of him as
he approached the try line.
What could have caused
this? Pressure? Marital
problems? The mystery
remains intact, and Marin
remains dick of the day.
Luckily, solid big boy
carries by every fresher’s
idol Ben Jones gave
Imperial a chance to put
more points on the board
after an unfortunate try by
Reading. Despite strong
winds, Toby “so much
better than Allingham”
Daniels hit his line out
perfectly and the ensuing
maul made it past the try
line for 5 points (convert-
ed by surf soc).
Although the comeback
looked promising,
Reading eventually ran
away with the win, scoring
2 tries in quick succession
and bringing the game
to a close. Final score :
36-13. Despite the loss,
a very promising start to
the season for an inexperi-
enced squad, still learning
to find each other. Notable
performances included
Ben Jones’ demon carries,
Oli Wangchai’s quick pace
and Michael “Nice smile”
Radigan’s side line intimi-
dation tactics. In Sylvia…

All we do is win win win: a story of Imperial Lacrosse
T
his season the
Women’s 1st
Lacrosse team is
sprinkled full of
freshers and determined
to have a year of winning
and #goalsgoalsgoals.
And boy did we flourish
in their first match against
Kent.
With a gargantuan
score of 24-3, we couldn’t
have succeeded more
in showing them who’s
boss. With goals left, right
and centre from seniors
and freshers alike, we
challenged ourselves to
practise our settled play
about our ‘pushing’ (we
were just stronger), and
for the fact that we were
giving them bruises… it’s
lacrosse after all. In the
final quarter we decided
to test ourselves even
further by enforcing a no
checking (tackling) rule
for ourselves, which was a
trial of self-control against
the weaker team. MoM
went to fresher Florence
Wade Smith for some
mega lax skills. Overall
the match was worth the
trek to Kent, even if we
did arrive late to sports
night.

We found ourselves 2-1
down after the first quarter
but bounced back with a
strong second quarter in
both attack and defence
and we went into half-time
4-3 up. The curse of the
third quarter loomed large
as the rain started. A quick
flurry of goals from Kent
due to foolish penalties
found us losing our lead
and it was 7-7 going into
the 4th. However, cometh
the hour, cometh the men.
A thrilling final quarter
showed our true potential
and we won 11-8 .
Debutant Big Ben
(Lakey) and Little Ben
(Reed) caused Kent
trouble all day with 5 and
4 goals respectively. The
insatiable Georg Wachter
grabbed his first goal, and
Sully ‘Pingsman’ Mughal
also bagged. The hero of
the day was Tom ‘The
Wall’ Palmer with his first
match in goal, who was
simply sublime.

o your ordinary
man, it would
seem like your av-
erage Wednesday
but for the 1’s, it was much
more. Time for pretending
to lift weights at preseason
was over.
We made the miserable
2 hour journey and had a
rushed warm-up due to
traffic. With a small squad,
this was far from ideal.
and focussed on playing
smart lacrosse.
Charlotte Morphet was
our top goal scorer with
9 goals, although our
top assister was Arianna
Guppy. 3 members of our
team had a huge 100%
shot success rate including
final year medic Lexi
Wiesentanner. We even
kept our cool when the
other team complained
“Cometh the
hour, cometh
the men.
A thrilling
final quarter
showed our
true potential,
and we won
11-8”
