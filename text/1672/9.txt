J. Cole’s 4 Your Eyez Only tour: an accomplished
performance from a phenomenal artist
J
. Cole’s 4 Your Eyez
Only tour touched
down in London
town early this
week, with the Dreamville
front man selling out two
nights at the O2 Arena.
Cole was supported by his
labelmates Ari Lennox,
EARTHGANG (whose
recent Rags-EP is worth
a listen and whose Robots
EP drops on Friday), and
J.I.D. (who released his
criminally-underrated
debut album, The Never
Story, earlier this year).
After the performances
of tracks like Ari’s
‘Backseat’, Spillage
Village’s ‘Can’t Call It’,
and J.I.D.’s ‘Never’ from
the supporting acts had
sufficiently gassed the
crowd, the time had come
for the man himself to
take the stage. The cur-
tain dropped in dramatic
fashion to reveal a striking
backdrop of prison bars as

crowd before delivering
passionate performances
of ‘For Whom the Bell
Tolls’ and ‘Immortal’.
Cole had the crowd hang-
ing on his every word and
you could almost hear the
pain and emotion behind
his voice in every bar,
especially on deep album
cuts like ‘Ville Mentality’.
the whole arena rocking
for fan favourites like
‘Nobody’s Perfect’, ‘Can’t
Get Enough’, and ‘Power
Trip’.
As suggested by the
stage setup and J. Cole’s
attire, the show reflected
the album’s underlying
themes of police brutality
and America’s criminal
justice system. During his
performance of ‘Neigh-
bors’, Cole discussed
these issues at length,
addressing the broader
topic of race relations in
America whilst the big
screen showed CCTV
footage of a SWAT
team raiding his North
Carolina studio following
complaints from his white
neighbours. This was a
more poignant moment
but Cole raised the energy
once again, ending his set
with ‘A Tale of 2 Citiez’,
‘G.O.M.D.’, and ‘No Role
Modelz’ amongst other
hits from 2014 Forest Hills
Drive. For an artist that
is seemingly becoming
increasingly reclusive, this
show served as a reminder
of why J. Cole has such
a cult following. His
music connects with the
masses, and everyone in
attendance was captivated
from start to finish by his
presence. Also, did you
know he went platinum
with no features?
Slowdive prove to be worth the wait
I
t feels as fun, and
as relevant playing
together now as it
did when we first
started” said Slowdive’s
Neil Halstead about their
much-anticipated single
‘Star Roving’ upon its
release in January. This
was the band’s first new
material in 22 years.
Slowdive, a shoegaze
band from Reading known
for their dream-like sound
and often poignantly sad
lyrics, were dropped by
their record label in 1995
after refusing to make
a pop album. With the
music scene dominated
by Britpop, Slowdive
found themselves a source
new, and showed their
huge progression as a
band.
Other new songs such
as ‘Sugar for the Pill’ and
‘No Longer Making Time’
were equally successful,
flaunting their signature
overwhelming-yet-am-
bient sounds arranged in
refreshingly new ways.
The kaleidoscopic light
show behind the band was
incredible, so absorbing
that you often felt like the
only one in the room.
Old tracks retained their
magic. The whole crowd,
who had been generally
still and quiet up to this
point in classic shoegaze
fashion (a genre that
Slowdive helped pioneer),
came alive in the chorus
of ‘When the Sun Hits’.
Everyone sang in unison
and the emotion in the
room was palpable. This
whose lyrics are based on
a poem by James Joyce.
The music was stripped
bare as Rachel Goswell’s
ethereal voice held the
entire crowd, before
transforming into the epic
frenzied instrumental
for which Slowdive are
known best.
In short, Slowdive have
done exactly what they
hoped to do. The music
felt reinvigorated, and
many fans were treated
to a concert they never
imagined they’d see.
They have achieved what
so many artists fail to
do upon reunion – they
weren’t just as good as
they were before, they
were even better.

of ridicule in the press,
and quietly faded into
obscurity.
But now, after expe-
riencing a huge surge in
popularity during their
lengthy hiatus, they are
back. With a new, self-ti-
tled record out earlier
this year, they’ve gone
on tour to crowds far
bigger than they ever saw
in the nineties. Opening
their concert at Camden’s
famed Roundhouse with
‘Slomo’, the first song
of the new album, it was
immediately apparent that
this was no half-baked
reunion tour. This was not
to be a night of rehashing
old favourites for the
super-fans; this was fresh,
“Acoustic dirge
‘Dagger’left

was truer still of acoustic
dirge ‘Dagger’, which left
many visibly moved to
tears. But perhaps most
impressive was ‘Golden
Hair’, a Syd Barrett cover

setup, and J.

him on stage to provide
the vocals for ‘Change’,

his older material and had

you haven’t got a string of
successful glam albums
and the invention of ambi-
ent music under your belt,
these can be notoriously
tricky. This, however
seems like such an obvi-
ous pairing that surely it
couldn’t go wrong: two
laidback young rockers
that have captured a
generation with kooky at-
titudes and finessed guitar
work, uniting to break new
ground.
At first, it certainly feels
more Kurt than Courtney.
There’s disappointingly
little of the energy and
rawness of Barnett’s
2015’s Sometimes I Sit and
Think, and Sometimes I
Just Sit. Feedback-driven,

for an altogether slower,
darker, fleshier sound. But
it’s not a full on Vile-esque
reverie either; the pair hit

that’s somehow a bit…
Oasis. This is particularly
notable on reworked
old Barnett track ‘Outta
the Woodwork’ and Jen
Cloher (Barnett’s wife)
cover ‘Fear is Like a
Forest’.
The same is true
lyrically. Both Barnett’s
flooring wit and Vile’s
introspective musings are
blunted and blended, and
the result is neither one
thing nor the other. Major
themes include writer’s
block, touring agonies,
and differing tastes in
breakfast. Top stuff.
But this is what
actually makes the
album so appealing. The
whole LP is a dialogue,
a pally chatter, between
two artists – actually,
scrap that – two friends.
Thoughts and feelings are
thrown back and forth in
the form of soothing riffs
and monotone call and
response. It’s honest and
intimate, cosy and whole-
some. And as flies on the
wall, we’re invited to join
the conversation. Though
it may not be quite as large
as the sum of their parts,
both are hugely comfort-
able with what they’re
doing. They’ve very
little to prove and they’re
having fun not proving it.
W
riting a
follow up
to 2014’s
g a rg a n t u -
an, Grammy-winning,
self-titled album was
never going to be an easy
task for Annie Clark, so
perhaps that’s why it took
so long to do. Mind you,
when you’re being hailed
as the modern day Ziggy
Stardust, you want to
make sure you get things
right. St. Vincent’s first
major release in 3 years
is an infallibly solid,
instantly catchy, art-pop
classic – but it feels maybe
a bit too familiar.
There’s a distinctly
poppy glaze on the
first side, Clark’s much
loved screeching guitars
swapped ever increasingly
often in favour of crisp
synths and punchy drum
machines. It’s fun and feel-
good. Or at least at first
glance. Lyrically, themes
are dark and desolate;
addiction, depression, and
loss. Second track and
pre-album single ‘Pills’,
for example, is a satanic
advertising jingle for a
drug-dependent lifestyle,
yet could be mistaken
for an electrified nursery
rhyme.
Five tracks in, however,
things take a turn and
emotions are laid bare. A
brooding, sinister sound
introduces ‘Los Ageless’,
before breaking down into
anguished cries of “How
could anybody have you
and lose you / and not
lose their minds too?”,
and then, after a spiralling
instrumental, a chilling
spoken word outro (“I try
to write you a love song,
but it comes out a lament”)
repeated over and over as
a desperate mantra.
Standout track ‘Happy
Birthday, Johnny’ comes
in the form of a letter to an
estranged friend or lover,
who we can only assume
to be the same as the
previous album’s ‘Prince
Johnny’. With sparse
backing, Clark unsuccess-
fully tries to reminisce,
instead lingering over his
battles with substances,
homelessness, and crime.
And though she blames
herself, she feels no longer
able to help him.
The LP covers all bases,
with no easily identifiable
low points. It’s rough and
gnarly, it’s sexy and asser-
tive, it’s coy and tender,
it’s… exactly what we’d
expect from St. Vincent,
but it’s nothing especially
new. She’s certainly found
her groove, but perhaps
she’s a bit too comfortable
in it.
