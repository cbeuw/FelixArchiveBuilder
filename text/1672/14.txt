Whether you’re a chatter box or just like talking to new people over a cup
of tea then the Conversation Project could be just the thing for you!
This volunteering project pairs you up with overseas students and
researchers who are looking to improve their spoken English through
informal conversational English, we just ask for the minimum of one
hour a week!Your sessions can be doing anything from walking round a
museum to chatting over lunch, it’s up to you!
New members of the College sometimes have difficulty conversing in
English and you will play an essential role in helping them to improve
their conversational English and feel part of the Imperial community.
