T
here was a time
when, as an
adult, I did not
read books. Then
one evening, when I lay
awake overthinking and
analysing, I realised what
this meant. If I continued
at my current rate of
reading 0.75 books a year
on holiday, then I would
likely die not having read
100 books. I was then
suddenly aware of the
pressure of acquainting
myself with the literary
world as soon as possible,
and how daunting that
prospect was.
In order to rectify the
situation, I went to a local
charityshopandboughtthe
first book that caught my
fancy. A fan of Benedict
Cumberbatch and all
things ‘detective-ey’,
I decided on When We
Were Orphans, by Kazuo
Ishiguro. Reading this
story recovered my lost
love of reading and ignited
a new passion for writing.
Published in 2000, it
remained my favourite
book even ten years later.
It is well-deserved, and
with Christopher, an odd
but loveable man that I
still miss now. Christo-
pher’s journey begins
as a renowned London
detective, modelled on
the likes of Sherlock (but
with social acceptance
and without the illicit drug
use, so not that much like
Sherlock) who transforms
into a brave crusader for
justice, with the story’s
climax happening on the
front lines in war-torn
Shanghai where he expe-
riences death and pain to
find the truth, while in the
process risking his happi-
ly-ever-after. He travels
in search of an answer to
the mysterious and unex-
plained disappearance of
his parents as a boy – the
ultimate case of his career
and the question his life
had been building up to
answer. The tension is high
and the action is thrilling.
The will-they-won’t-
they between Christopher
and his lady-friend Sarah
is tantalising. If you are
starting to get worried
that Ishiguro is an action
writer and not for you, I
can assure you that he can
write romance. Perhaps
not in the sexually graphic
way of Murakami, but he
creates a depth in his char-
acters’ relationships that is
relatable and real. Ishiguro
uses the ever-unreliable
memory to reveal the
events and truths behind
a friendship or a romance.
As with relationships,
memories greatly affect
our lives. Memories are
fascinating things, they
remain with us whether
we want it or not, and what
we decide to remember
and what we don’t at times
feels out of our control.
For example, I can
remember the name of my
mum’s school friend even
though we have never
met. However I cannot,
under any circumstances,
remember the password
to my work email. It is not
just Christopher’s story
that is intensified by the
frustrations of a biased
memory. In Ishiguro’s
recent and, in my opinion,
most beautiful book, The
Buried Giant, he explores
again the nature of how
influential yet fragile our
memories are, and the
anxiety that comes with
defeated, with heroes,
knights, King Arthur:
undoubtedly all the well-
loved elements of fantasy.
Memory is not the only
thing to change with time,
and as his characters grow,
so do their relationships.
The Buried Giant presents
an aged kind of love, a
marriage that has been
battered and bruised, until
commitment is stronger
than any flame which may
have once been lit. In much
of Ishiguro’s work, I see
the tenderness of family
and companionship.
If it isn’t clear, I think
Ishiguro more than
deserves his Nobel Prize,
and if you haven’t read
anything by him, then
please do. Ishiguro’s
characters are so real
that we can see pieces of
ourselves in them. He tells
a story with such fluid
simplicity, with only just
enough detail but all of it
crucial. His books are, if
one thing, entertaining. He
makes it look easy.
