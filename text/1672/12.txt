How a terrible beauty is born: Vahni Capildeo’s poetry
workshop on ‘be-monstering’
B
e-monster not
thy feature,”
says Albany to
Goneril; “proper
deformity seems not in
the fiend so horrid as in
woman.” In King Lear,
what renders Goneril’s
ruthlessness particularly
chilling is the juxtaposing
presence of inhumanity –
or, inAlbany’s Elizabethan
conception, unfemi-
ninity – in someone so
manifestly a human. The
disconcerting quality of
such incongruousness
and its ‘othering’ effect
are amongst the several
ways of ‘be-monstering’
explored in the poetry
workshop led by Vahni
Capildeo last weekend,
whose latest collection
Measures of Expatriation
won the Forward Prize for
Best Collection in 2016.
One example we
examined in the workshop
was Francis Ponge’s
Faune et Flore (from Le
Parti Pris des Choses),
in which the flora are
likewise ‘be-monstered’
through estrangement:
much of their character-
isation draws on their
lack of human qualities
(“Aucun geste, aucune
pensée, peut-être aucun
désir, aucune intention”
– ‘no gesture, no thought,
perhaps no desire, no
intention’), whose ‘other-
ness’ is reinforced by the
extensive use of anaphoric
sentences beginning with
“ils” (they). Indeed the
word ‘monster’ itself –
derived from the Latin
monere, ‘to warn’ – ety-
mologically referred to
malformed creatures so
strange and otherworldly
in appearance that they
came to be seen as porten-
tous of divine ‘warning’.
Estrangement on the
level of language itself
also comes into play here,
for example in Ponge’s
neologistic use of “ex-
croissance” (outgrowth).
This, as is the case with
any ‘be-monstering’ of
the artistic medium itself,
runs the risk of alienating
the reader altogether.
An estranged lexicon
could as much intensify
as obscure meaning, and
leave us puzzled with, to
steal a phrase from Wilde,
“the rage of Caliban not
seeing his own face in a
glass”. Analogously we
find in modern theatre the
dilemmas associated with
the use of Verfremdungse-
ffekts – Bertoldt Brecht’s
method of distancing the
audience from characters.
Equally if not more
unsettling in Faune is the
description of “irrémédi-
able”, uncontrollable
growth, which became
the focus of our discus-
sion of monstrosity in
nature: starfish fissioning,
zombies, cancer. In par-
ticular, the multiplication
and replication of things
in large numbers and the
metamorphosis of single
beings can seem particu-
larly uncanny. This leads
us naturally to the terri-
tory of ‘be-monstering’
through the exploitation of
our inherent ambivalence
towards identity and
self-awareness.
To recall the etymology
of ‘monster’, there is
something self-referential
about our tendency to
view the strangeness
perceived in others as a
sinister reflection on our
own prospects. Whilst the
replication and metamor-
phosis of single beings and
the numerosity of similar
beings invoke our fear,
both of a loss of identity
and of the awareness of
ourselves as distinct living
beings, the capacity for
shape-changing is further-
more reminiscent of our
deformability, vulnerabili-
ty and, as Capildeo noted,
edibility: it is, to quote
Wilde again, Caliban’s
rage upon seeing his re-
flection. Not least for this
reason does an animal’s
eating of another animal
often ‘be-monster’them in
our eyes. A more extreme
example is our horror
of cannibalism, widely
regarded as the epitome
of monstrosity, symbolic
both of our effaceability
and of our capacity for
self-effacement, and
hence of a double loss of
identity.
If Freud is right about
the universality of primary
narcissism, then, it would
not perhaps ‘be-monster’
this article to end with
Tiresias’ cryptic comment
on Narcissus: that he
will live long, “si se non
noverit” (‘if he does not
learn to know himself’).

compelling that she could
see herself expanding it
into a full-length novel.
Fridlund had researched
ice, fishing, and almost
every detail of the Minne-
sotan landscape that plays
into her character’s voice.
Similarly, the family in
Fiona Mozley’s Elmet is
intimately connected with
the Yorkshire landscape
theyhavemadetheirhome,
and her novel is a response
to her generation’s “frus-
trated relationship with
land”. A PhD student who
works part-time in an
independent bookshop,
Mozley felt that her gener-
ation can “never be secure
in our homes”, because
of the fluctuating value
of property, especially in
cities like London. It is
especially hard for young
writers and artists to gain
security, she felt, and that
is going to impoverish this
city.
The running theme of
the shortlisted books was
using art and storytelling
as a response to current
and historical issues.
Elmet represented the
voice of a young gener-
ation frustrated with the
difficulties of settling
down in a land that one
can call one’s own, with
the security of a physical
space to call home so out
of reach. On the other
hand, Ali Smith’s Autumn
was an experiment in
writing about issues so
raw and current things are
still going on as the book
reaches the bookshelf.
Dubbed the ‘Brexit novel’,
Autumn tackles immigra-
tion, xenophobia, identity,
and the backlash to the
increasing movement of
people and ideas. Mohsin
Hadid’s Exit West brings
the harsh realities of
forced migration into
sharp focus by following
individual people caught
in the conflict – real
people with concerns
and relationships that are
like our own, but, unlike
us, have their values and
relationships challenged
by their situation.
In times of difficulty,
frivolous pursuits with
no practical value. This
year’s shortlist shows
that anger and a desire for
change can be channelled
into creative works that
bring issues into sharper
focus and introduce dif-
ferent perspectives on the
same situation. Literature
is a political tool and a
participant in the dialogue
of current affairs, but
veiled in the beauty of
language. These books are
a testament to the power
of words and the value of
imagination.
This event was part
of the London Literature
Festival at London’s
Southbank Centre.

The six shortlisted authors sat down the night before the

t was the night before
the announcement
of the 2017 Man
Booker Prize winner,
and it was the first time
the shortlisted writers had
all come together in the
same space. In the Royal
Festival Hall, where all six
shortlisted writers sat next
to each other on stage, the
anticipation was palpable
amid the celebratory
atmosphere. There was a
collective feeling of awe
among the audience, of
passion and sincerity em-
anating from stage, and a
general sense of wonder at
the power of words.
Three had flown in from
America, one was born in
Lahore. Two were here
to read from their debut
novels. Two were from
the UK – one English, one
Scottish. One was doing
her PhD and worked part-
time in an independent
All the books harboured
themes of displacement
and loss, whether in time,
space, or memory. For the
first time, the writers all
met each other and stood
in the dressing room, dis-
cussing their works before
going on stage. Any could
win the Man Booker this
year.
Ofcourse,wenowknow
that George Saunders won
the Man Booker 2017 with
his first novel Lincoln in
the Bardo, inspired by
the story that Abraham
Lincoln had gone to the
grave of his favourite son
in grief after he died, to
somehow interact with
his body. Drawing from
the idea of the ‘bardo’
in Tibetan Buddhism as
the intermediary space
between life and death,
Saunders’ story is narrated
by a chorus of 166 ghosts
that Lincoln and his son
encounter while there. Its
interesting structure and
narration was a constant
point of discussion regard-
ing the book, and was the
result of Saunders’attempt
to give a more omniscient
relaying of the story, rather
than have either protag-
onist or the gravedigger
narrate the story.
Indeed, throughout the
readings and discussion
of the evening the idea of
‘genre’ was apparent. One
audience member asked
during the Q&A: have
we exhausted all genres
– science fiction, fantasy,
historical? If you (the
authors) were to create
an entirely new genre,
what would it be? Fiona
Mozley, author of Elmet,
jumped in to reply. Of all
the shortlisted works, she
said, it seems that hers was
the “least experimental of
form”; however, she saw
it as a study in genre. It is
a Western with something
else, she said – her novel
has an archetypal mas-
culine character, but in
this case, undercut by his
teenage daughter. Char-
acters in her book have
“bodies and behaviours
that are not quite real”,
and hence carry elements
of fantasy.
Saunders, in reply to
the same question, noted
that if one starts out
with a mission to create
something new, it was not
going to happen. Original
forms and genres come
about when you have
something to say, but are
frustrated with the limi-
tations of existing forms,
he said. The unique form
of Lincoln in the Bardo
certainly seems to be an
answer to the shortcom-
ings of more conventional
forms.
This year’s shortlist is
an interesting mix – the
novels on the list seem
to be pushing the bound-
aries of fiction, being
experimental with form,
structure, and themes.
Alison Flood of The
Guardian analysed all the
past winners of the Booker
prize and concluded that
the average winner was a
privately-educated white
English man in his late 40s
who has written a book of
less than 400 pages with a
male protagonist, usually
his seventh. This year’s
shortlist consists of three
women, two of whom
are debut novelists (one
American), a man of Pa-
kistani origin, a book that
is a whopping 880 pages
(hardcover), and another
American short-sto-
ry-writer-turned-novelist.
Both 4321 and Lincoln in
the Bardo deal with histor-
ical events and real char-
acters from history, while
Exit West and Autumn deal
with very current issues of
migration and belonging.
In History of Wolves and
Elmet, landscape and
setting become important
elements and are intricate-
ly related to characters and
theme.
The authors took turns
to read an extract from
their book, and then
chatted with the host
about it, followed by a
Q&A session open to the
floor. When asked if his
book was meant for the
theatres, Saunders replied,
“definitely”, and that
they had already sold the
movie rights. With the 166
different voices, the story
certainly lends itself well
to a dramatic interpreta-
tion. In fact, an audiobook
is already out, with 166
unique individuals voicing
the ghosts, including the
likes of Ben Stiller and
Julianne Moore, Saunders
himself, and – when he ran
out of people to ask – he
even roped in his family
members to voice the
characters.
On the other hand, when
asked about the possibility
of a movie from 4321,
Auster laughed and said
that his novel was “mov-
ie-proof”. 4321 follows
four alternate lives of the
same character, and the
host had asked him which
of the four lives would be
a focus should a movie be
made out of it. All four
are equally important,
Auster replied, and hence
it would be impossible to
make it into a film of less
than three hours. Despite
that, he added, it was “a
very stripped-down book”
– much to the audience’s
amusement.
Emily Fridlund, like
Saunders, started off as a
short story writer and her
History of Wolves started
out as a short story. The
difference between a short
story and a novel, she said,
was that one “had to stay
interested in the character
in a novel”. Somehow,
