A
fter a drain-
ing year at
Imperial, and
quite possibly
an internship-packed
summer, most of us crave
a vacation, preferably
outside London. While
coming back home is
often enjoyable, going
somewhere completely
new can be even more ap-
pealing. One of the most
popular travel destinations
is the United States, which
has so much to offer for
tourists, from majestic
busy cities to fascinating
natural wonders. If you’ve
never visited the US, you
might have heard it’s very
large, but make no mistake
– it’s actually even bigger
than you think! I spent
2 weeks in California,
with a short detour to Las
Vegas, and it still wasn’t
enough. To fully explore
the magnificence of even
a small part of the country
requires a lot of time
and – you’ve guessed it
– money! The good news
is that nowadays it’s more
than possible to travel on
a budget, so here are some
tips based on my first-hand
experience.
ACCOMMODATION
While it’s possible to
find an affordable Airbnb
or hostel, it’s even better
to crash on someone’s
couch for free, which
leaves you more money
for actual travelling. If
you don’t know anyone
you could stay with, don’t
stress – you can always
opt for Couchsurfing,
a website offering free
accommodation for travel-
lers all around the world.
Yes, it does sound dodgy
at first, but it’s completely
legit and has helped many
young travellers, includ-
ing myself. Surprisingly,
the place I stayed at in Los
Angeles happened to be
very fancy, comfortable,
and arguably better than
any hostel. Our host even
gave us a lift to and from
the closest underground
station every day as well
as sharing his food with
us.
That being said, this
doesn’t happen all the
time – we were just ex-
tremely lucky. However,
although most homes
don’t resemble hotels,
Couchsurfing is still a
good way to not only save
money but also meet the
locals. For instance, the
place we stayed at in Vegas
there was an interesting
and important part of our
travelling experience.
Nonetheless, if you opt
for Couchsurfing, there
are several important
things to remember:
check the references from
previous guests to make
sure your potential host
is trustworthy and their
home is suitable for you;
always be careful, espe-
cially if travelling alone;
as trivial as it sounds, be
polite and respectful –
some travellers feel that
they can do whatever they
please, like come back
drunk at 3am, leave a
complete mess after their
visit, or not even bother
interacting with their host;
though the hosts don’t
expect any money for your
stay, a good thank you gift
could be cooking them a
meal, sending a postcard
from your home country,
or even just spending
some time chatting and
getting to know them; start
sending requests early –
you’ll likely get rejected
a lot since the best places
are also the most popular
ones, so don’t leave it to
the last minute; and finally
ask your friends to leave
references for you about
their experience staying
at your place – this will
complete your profile and
hosts will be more likely
to trust you.
TRANSPORT WITHIN
CITIES
You may have heard
already that the best way
of getting around the US is
by car. Unfortunately, we
didn’t have one and ended
up getting around by
public transport and Uber.
To our surprise, we didn’t
experience many problems
with the infamous LA
traffic: going places did
take quite a bit of time but
no more than you’d expect
from such a large city.
The underground system
in LA isn’t as popular as
in London: the trains run
every 20 minutes only and
don’t serve the whole city.
But it also has some perks
– it’s not as crowded as the
Tube and costs just under
$2 one way.
In contrast, Vegas
doesn’t have an under-
ground system as it’s a
much smaller city in the
middle of a desert. But
you can get around by
buses ($8 for 24h) or Uber
(around $23 for 25min
ride). If you’re travelling
on a budget, you’ll most
definitely live far away
from the Strip – the main
street with expensive
hotels – where all the

wasn’t nearly as fancy or
tidy as our LA accommo-
dation, but we were still
given comfortable sofas
with clean bedding and
towels, and our host also
shared his food with us
and picked us up from the
bus station. Plus, getting
to know him and other
couchsurfers who stayed

“If you want

for a rental car”
activities take place. So
Ubering to and from the
Strip every day is the most
convenient option but it’ll
cost you a fortune. The
good news is – one day
is enough to look around
Vegas, so a couple of taxi
rides should be affordable.
Otherwise, if you opt for
a rental car, there are a
few hotels that offer free
parking even for non-
guests.
our bank accounts quite
a bit, though I’d say it’s
still cheaper than renting
an Airbnb in SF (unless
you’re lucky enough
to find something on
Couchsurfing). However,
travelling outside the bay
area for the scenic views
of Yosemite National
Park or Big Sur is next to
impossible without a car:
you’d spend the whole day
on public transport, which
is expensive and requires
at least 3 transfers!
So if you want to make
the most of the West Coast
in a single trip, opt for
a rental car. It’s usually
cheaper as well, especially
if you travel in a group
and share the expenses.
If you can’t drive, public
transport is a good-enough
option to explore the cities,
though it won’t allow you
to sightsee much outside
of them.
TRANSPORT OUTSIDE
CITIES
To reiterate, renting a
car is probably the best
option, which will allow
you to explore the won-
derful West Coast in your
own time. For example,
you could drive from LA
to SF along the scenic
State Route 1, making
stops at mesmerizing
beaches to enjoy sunshine
and the ocean, and reach
a golden state of mind.
You can pick up and
return the car in different
cities, which makes things
even easier. You can also
travel by Megabus – if
you book your tickets
well in advance, you can
get a bargain for $1 one
way. Alternatively, you
can choose a domestic
flight, which usually are
(relatively) affordable and
quick.
Moreover, a trip to
California would not be
complete without visiting
the national parks, such as
Death Valley, Yosemite, or
Grand Canyon. Of course,
as you may have guessed,
they are quite far away
from the main cities (2-4h
drive). So if you decide to
travel such a distance, it’s
best to spend at least two
days there so you can hike
and explore the places at
your own pace. Plus, park
entrance fees ($20-30 for
7 days) are charged per
vehicle so splitting the
cost between a group of
travellers offers a very
affordable trip. Alterna-
tively, you can book 1-day
bus tours but they are
quite pricey (e.g. around
$200 per person for Death
Valley) and don’t give you
enough time to explore

Finally, our last stop,
San Francisco, was one
hell of an expensive city,
the second priciest area in
the States after Manhattan,
according to the locals.
We happened to stay in
Albany, a city separated
from SF by Berkeley and
Oakland, and spent at least
an hour on the (very fast!)
train every day to reach the
SF centre. One-way tickets
range from $5 to $10,
which naturally drained
the area. Having said that,
travelling with a guide is
probably safer since they
take you to tourist-friendly
places and you don’t have
to worry about things like
cars breaking down or
getting lost. So if you opt
to drive by yourself, find
out the safest way to travel
around and be prepared,
e.g. take plenty of water
and wear appropriate
clothes.
Finally, the most expen-
sive part of long-distance
trips is usually flight
tickets but luckily there
are a few budget airlines
offering transfer between
the US and Europe for as
little as $400 both ways.
They don’t provide meals
and allow limited baggage,
but are still a good way to
save money. For instance,
Norwegian Airlines offer
direct flights, 2 hand
luggage pieces, and an
on-board entertainment
system with films and TV
shows. Another affordable
option is WOW Airlines,
though they don’t offer
direct flights or in-flight
entertainment, so be sure
to bring a book on board!
FOOD
If you’re travelling on
a budget, you’ll probably
go for food from grocery
stores rather than res-
taurants. However, the
cheapest food might be full
of sugar and preservatives,
so if you want something
healthier, you can shop at
Trader Joe’s, which sells
organic products and is a
cheaper version of Whole
Foods. The famous Target
also offers reasonable
prices but anything from
7-eleven will cost you an
arm and a leg. If you get
hungry while sightseeing,
there’s a McDonalds or
Subway literally on every
corner. A bit more expen-
sive but still affordable
option is In-N-Out Burger,
a chain based in California
only and thus an integral
part of your West Coast
experience. Their food
is delicious, and you can
order something from
their secret online menu
if you want to dine like a
local!
