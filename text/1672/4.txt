College Un-
ion’s Autumn
Elections closes today,
following a week of the
polls being open.
The elections, which
are run each year, see
the student body electing
candidates in a number
of positions. The major
positions being contested
are those in the Academic
Representation Network
(ARN), the Graduate Stu-
dents Union (GSU), and
the Wellbeing Representa-
tion Network (WBRN)
– a new Union structure,
modelled on the ARN,
responsible for facilitating
wellbeing support for
students. Fintan O’Con-
nor, Deputy President
(Welfare) speaking to
Felix, said he hoped the
Student taken to hospital following post-sports night
altercation
A
n Imperial
student had
to be taken
to hospital
last week, following an
altercation after sports
night.
Felix have heard
reports than one Imperial
student punched another
in the jaw following sports
night at Reynolds Bar, on
Charing Cross campus.
The event occurred in the
small hours of Thursday
morning, the 12th
October.
Witnesses to the incident
say that the attack was
“unprovoked”.
The victim was taken to
Accident and Emergency
after contacting the police.
After taking statements
from witnesses, the police
reportedly travelled to the
assailant’s house, possibly
to take them into custody.
In a statement, an
Imperial College Union
representative told Felix:
“Imperial College Union
takes the safety and
wellbeing of its members
extremely seriously.
unacceptable and will not
be tolerated. We would
always encourage anyone
who has witnessed – or
been the victim of – violent
or abusive behaviour to
report it to the police or
a member of Union or
College staff. We were
very concerned to learn of
allegations made against
one of our members
last week, and we have
suspended the individual
from any positions of
responsibility they hold
pending investigation.”
Imperial College
echoed this, telling Felix
“The College considers
any abusive or violent
behaviour to be entire-
ly unacceptable, and
would always encourage
members of the commu-
nity to report such behav-
iour”.
It is unclear whether
the victim will be pressing
charges.
WBRN would “support a
broader wellbeing strate-
gy”.

Members were also open
to nominations, as well as
a number of Constituent
Union and Clubs, Society,
and Project positions.
At the time of writing,
390 candidates had put
themselves forward for
roles in the Elections, up
from 312 candidates in
last year’s elections – an
increase of 25%. This
increase can potentially
be explained by the larger
range and increased
number of roles available.
This increase in participa-
tion has been seen across
all faculties: the Faculty of
Medicine has fielded more
running in the ARN. This
yearonly183studentshave
put themselves forward
for undergraduate ARN,
compared with 242 in last
year’s Autumn Elections.
It seems likely that this is
due to the increase in the
number of representative
positions in this election
cycle. Overall, the number
of candidates for ARN
and WBRN combined is
higher than those who ran
for ARN last year.
Some students Felix
spoke to expressed con-
cerns about the number
of candidates running for
positions in the WBRN:
while 52 positions
within the network have
candidates in the election,
there are 27 unfilled,
including a number of
Departmental Wellbe-
ing Representatives. A
couple of departments
are notable for their lack
of participants: Physics,
for example, has nobody
running for their Depart-
mental Wellbeing Repre-
sentative, or for their Year
One, Two, and Four Well-
being Representatives.
Of the positions with no
candidates, a dispropor-
tionate number are those
for third and fourth-year
students.
Some of the most con-
tested positions were the
Union Council Ordinary
Members, with 49 students
running for the 16 posi-
tions available, up from
16 candidates last year.
Undergraduate positions
were particularly popular,
with 17 students running
for the Engineering Ordi-
nary Member (UG) roles,
for example.
Other positions,
however, had candidates
running uncontested. Out
of the 155 positions with
candidates running, 69 of
these had single candi-
dates running unopposed.
Turnout is expected to
be higher than last year’s,
which was 14.71%: at the
time of writing, 21.15%
of students had voted,
including 32% of under-
graduate students.
In a statement to Felix,
a Union representative
said: “We’re pleased to
see a record number of
candidates in the Autumn
Elections, including three
times as many Council
candidates and a 20% in-
crease in people interested
in our Representation Net-
works than this time last
year. Postgraduate partici-
pation has also improved,
with twice as many
Business School students
running for roles than last
year and more candidates
for the Graduate Students’
Union than in any point in
its history. Thanks to our
members, we are the most
