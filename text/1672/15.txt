An operatic nightmare of psychological trauma
FILM
A
n unprece-
dented level of
discussion was
prompted when
the line-up was announced
for the Cannes Film
Festival in the spring.
The new golden age of
television had continued
its juggernaut-like pro-
cession, penetrating the
exclusive La Croisette for
the very first time, as past
Palme d’Or winners David
Lynch and Jane Campion
were invited to premiere
new seasons of their
shows Twin Peaks and Top
of the Lake respectively.
Streaming giant Netflix
also continued its meteoric
rise, with two films being
accepted into the main
competition, albeit with
a warning from festival
director Thierry Frémaux
that they would not be
allowed back in the future
unless they guaranteed
theatrical releases in
France. There was ex-
citement at the big name
auteurs set to compete for
the Palme, with the likes
of Michael Haneke, Todd
Haynes, Sofia Coppola
Andrey Zyvagintsev,
Yorgos Lanthimos, Noah
Baumback, Bong Joon-
Ho, Michel Hazanavicius,
Ruben Ostlund, and Hong
Sang-Soo competing for
perhaps the most pres-
tigious prize in cinema
alongside the Academy
Award.
Amidst all the fanfare,
perhaps the most an-
ticipated news was that
Scottish writer-director
Lynne Ramsay was to
make her return to the
silver screen in partner-
ship with no less than the
great Joaquin Phoenix.
The film would also see
her reuniting with Radi-
ohead guitarist Johnny
Greenwood, who’s scores
have been enthralling us
for the past decade ever
since the legendary Paul
Thomas Anderson asked
him to do the music for
his masterpiece There
Will Be Blood. You Were
Never Really Here, titled
A Beautiful Day in France,
went to the French Riviera
unfinished. It was the last
film in competition to be
shown, and editor Joe Bini
only completed his cut a
matter of hours before it
was due to be screened.
Ramsay stunned the world
with Ratcatcher, Morven
Caller and We Need to Talk
About Kevin in the past,
and she delivered again,
receiving a seven minute
standing ovation. She went
on to share the festival’s
Best Screenplay prize
with Yorgos Lantimos and
Efthymis Filippou for The
Killing of a Scared Deer,
with Phoenix adding to
his already bulging trophy
cabinet with a win for Best
Actor.
expressionistic neo-noir
thriller as You Were Never
Really Here. The film
follows ex-war veteran
and FBI agent turned gun-
for-hire Joe (Phoenix). In
the very first scene we join
him completing a job, and
almost immediately after
that visit him at his house
mid-suicide attempt – the
first of many efforts – as
he fights to repress the
demons of his past. He
is interrupted by a shout
from his ailing mother
(Judith Roberts), who he
lives with and cares for
diligently.
Joe is contacted by
Senator Albert Votto (Alex
Mannette) to find his
missing teenage daughter,
and hurt those who took
her from him. He locates
her fairly quickly in a
seedy brothel, but as he
attemptstoreturnhertoher
father, his rescue mission
is suddenly derailed,
unleashing a maelstrom of
violence involving corrupt
power and vile fantasy,
taking him deeper and
deeper into the hallucina-
tory darkness. It would be
wrong to divulge any of
the details of the plot, and
also extremely difficult, as
Ramsay creates a swirling,
operatic nightmare.
This is ostensibly a film
with elements of action,
thriller, noir, drama, and
even horror and comedy.
From the logline, this
could easily be cliché,
and yet Ramsay and her
cast and crew elevate it
to much more. Though
the action elements are
superbly visceral, Ramsay
is more concerned with
the psyche of her leading
man, choosing to delve
into trouble that torments
him, without ever reveal-
ing too much.
Likewise, Joe Bini’s
razor sharp editing aids
with this beacon of visual
story-telling, only ever
allowing us a foot in the
door without opening up,
continually rejecting the
opportunity of exploita-
tion or glamorisation of
violence by cutting away
from the action rather
than to it. Greenwood’s
eerie score is for the most
part a driving, electrical
symphony, but he balances
this delicately, switching it
up for a majestic underwa-
ter scene at a lake.
As with her previous
films, Ramsay renounces
the spoken word for
startling images, always
choosing to show rather
than tell, and even then
only showing glimpses;
clues to a mystery we will
never solve, questions
with no answers. Joaquin
Phoenix proves himself
to be among the greatest
actors in the world. Since
his return from a self-im-
posed break to launch a
rap career (which turned
out to be a hoax), he has
embarked on one of the
hottest runs any actor has
experienced in cinematic
history, comparable, for
example, to Jack Nichol-
son in the early 1970s. He
is able to communicate so
much in a look or a shift
in body position, and it is
hard to imagine anyone
else in this role. The scary
thing is that this would be
career-defining role for
almost any other actor
working today – and yet
Phoenix can do this half-
asleep. Stewart introduced
Phoenix as the man who
makes this film, and
while this film is a lesson
in how having top draw
artists such as Ramsay and
Greenwood collaborating
can give birth to such
incredible work, without
Phoenix this could all
break down to cliché and
pretension. When asked to
comment on the film, all
he said was “thank you all
for coming and enjoy the
film”. Wise words.

“Ramsay
and her crew
elevate the film
above cliché”
When London Film
Festival director Clare
Stewart invited Ramsay
onto the stage to present
her film at its UK premiere
on Saturday, one would
never imagine that this
pint-sized jovial Scottish
woman, cracking jokes
left, right, and centre,
would be capable of
producing such a dark,
