A parable of Brexit, greed, and the making of modern
Britain at the National Theatre
Lyndsey Turner drags the legend of St. George and the Dragon into the modern era, having it take on a cuttingly-
relevant message about the importance of solidarity.

T
here is more
death in that kind
of life and more
life in that kind of
death. That is the message
of Saint George in refer-
ence to a life lived under
the rule of the despotic
dragon. On the face of
things these two characters
should be at the heart of an
epic tale of heroism versus
evil, but Rory Mullarkey’s
play is not simply a classic
heroic legend – it is a
commentary on the people
of England. The day of
the hero is gone and we
must all band together to
overcome the new dragons
of capitalist greed, bureau-
cracy, and indifference: a
powerful and insightful
message, although its
delivery in this production
had a subtlety more akin
to that of George’s great
three-headed nemesis than
the damsel in distress.
This tale at first takes
on a very literal form.
The dragon himself is
a tyrannical ruler who
can transform into the
form of the three-headed,
fire-breathing beast.
However, we soon see
the village evolve into a
post-industrial revolution
town and from a town it
grows into a modern city
akin to any in Britain
today. So too grows the
dragon, progressively
taking on a new, less
tangible form in each of
the three ages. Although
the setting is described as
an island ‘much like our
own’, it is like our island
in almost every way. The
modern city is complete
with pub brawls, hen
parties, and microwave
meals – a blatant indica-
tion that this is a message
targeted towards the real
Britain of the present day.
The message is clear:
the burden of improving
the world can no longer
fall on just one person,
and the solution is certain-
ly not to be found in an
outdated, historical figure.
The elephant in the room
– or should I say dragon
– is Brexit. A proponent
of change, the play is a
damning indictment of the
belief that our solutions lie
“The play is
a damning
indictment of
the belief that
our solutions
lie in going
back to a
simpler time”
in going back to a simpler
time, but it is also critical
of those who fervently
oppose this view – we
can sometimes become so
utterly caught up in what
we think is right that it
causes us to destroy the
things we were trying to
defend in the first place.
Solidarity and a sense
of community is the one
constant that can pull us
through.
Despite the message
being very relevant, the
production itself was
almost three hours in
length, and combined with
the fact that the storyline
is designed to repeat itself
three times, at times it
made me feel as though
we needed a dragon to set
fire to the stage to spice
the plot up a bit.
Lyndsey Turner’s
production is speckled
with humour throughout,
keeping the mood at the
right level. This is helped
by the cast, notably Julian
Bleach who plays the
dragon, whose character
and style reminded me of
Count Olaf in the film ad-
aptation of A Series of Un-
fortunate Events. Toeing
the line between evil and
hilarity, his persona was
very satisfyingly reptilian.
Despite the light-hearted
mood, it is remarkable
how effectively Luke
Brady manages to change
the atmosphere to one
of sadness with his con-
vincing portrayal of the
Miller’s Son – the pitiable
victim of the dragon’s
fury. John Heffernan as
Saint George paints a
portrait of a confident
character throughout, who
is so set in his ways that
he cannot understand why
modern society can’t be
the way it used to be. His
overly-patient sweetheart
Elsa, played by Amaka
Okafor, is strongest
when torn away from the
conventional role of the
heroine, when in conflict
with Henry (Richard
Goulding) or her father
Charles (Gawn Grainger).
The young talent Reuel
Guzman who plays ‘boy’
stands out for his assured
performance.
The scenery and tech-
nical aspects of the per-
formance were brilliant.
This was especially true
for all manner of things
relating to fire. Things
were constantly spontane-
ously igniting, crackling
or exploding all over the
stage to the extent that I
began to question whether
there was indeed an actual
dragon crouched behind
the scenes. Despite the
technical brilliance – and
in part because of it – I
felt slightly short changed
watching the battle
between George and the
dragon. What we had all
been expectantly awaiting
turned out to be more of a
radio commentary by the
villagers of a supposedly
nail-biting fight in the
invisible sky above us.
Admittedly recreating a
battle involving a three
headed dragon may have
been fairly technically
challenging, but given the
excellency of the other
scenery I wouldn’t put
it past the crew to have
pulled it off. The lack of
a convincing battle scene
was partially compensated
for by the pyrotechnically
heavy display of three
dragon heads exploding
as they crashed into the
ground.
It would have been
better if the message
hadn’t been so obvious in
its structured three-part
delivery, but I thought that
it was unique and very
relevant. The characters
are almost all referred
to by job title rather
than name, perhaps for a
reason: in our everyday
lives we ourselves see
here the butcher, there the
driver, and the town crier.
Mullarkey is trying to tell
us that these people do
not represent us, they are
us – each and every one of
us must be prepared to be
heroic in our own way.

ST. GEORGE AND
THE DRAGON
“Beginning
cloaks its
vulnerable
core in an
armour of
humour”
Indira Mallik
Arts Editor
Looking for love in the lonely city
ARTS
O
livia Laing in
her exceptional
book, The
Lonely City,
remarks, “So much of
the pain of loneliness is
about concealment. But...
what’s so shameful about
wanting?”. Loneliness,
and the barriers we set
up even as we try to
forge new connections
are at the centre of David
Eldridge’s new play. In
Beginning, we meet Laura
and Danny at the end of a
housewarming party. She
is a 38-year-old managing
director who, despite
professional success, is
looking for a catalyst to
settle down, and he is
friend of a friend who stays
behind after everyone has
left despite his impulses to
run. Both are hiding their
fear of being alone, tipsy,
and yearning; they dance
around each other (some-
times literally), wanting
very much to be seen, and
at the same time, terrified
of being exposed.
The beats of Eldridge’s
narrative feel Tennessee
Williams-esque: A Cat on
a Hot Tin Roof for the Tin-
der-age. Only here, stifling
‘50s Mississippi repres-
sion has been replaced by
an equally stifling English
one in the present day.
Laura, Maggie-like, is
driven wild by a hunger to
fill a life she considers a
‘shell’. Danny, who at 42
hasn’t seen his daughter in
four years, is back living
with his Mum after the
break up of a marriage and
seems a latter-day Brick
Politt – struggling with
the idea he has let his life
slip through his fingers.
Just as Williams cut to
the bone of mid-century
America, Eldridge has
a knack of finding just
the right words: “I just
can’t face another Sunday
alone,” says Laura at one
point in a desperate plea
to stop Danny calling a
age of social media – true
connections feel out of
reach even as they seem to
be only a click away.
Much like the charac-
ters, the play cloaks its
tender, vulnerable core
in an armour of humour.
Beginning is frequently
painfully funny, ‘painful’
being the operative word.
Several times during
the play I wonder: “is it
actually possible to die
of secondhand embar-
rassment?”. As Laura
and Danny go to ever
increasing lengths to avoid
confronting their desire for
each other, sitting in the
audience feels like having
an out-of-body experience
at every awkward date
you’ve wanted to go well.
It is difficult to watch and
even more difficult to tear
your eyes away.
The story unfolds
over an hour and forty
minutes in real time – a
lot is revealed. Laura and
Danny go from strangers
who can’t take their eyes
off each other to telling
each other things they’ve
never told anyone else.
Objectively, the two cover
more emotional ground
than someone might cover
in years of therapy, yet
for me none of it seemed
too much. Polly Findlay’s
direction is masterful,
allowing the audience,
and the characters, room
to breathe in between the
revelations.
Justine Mitchell and
Sam Troughton deliver
wonderfully nuanced per-
formances, doing justice
to Eldridge’s carefully
crafted work.As the fragile
thread of desire crystal-
lises into a more lasting
understanding between
the couple, Troughton in
particular does a wonder-
ful job of peeling back
the layers on Danny, who
– once he manages to get
his foot out of his mouth
– transforms from a guy
with one too many laddish
quips to a kind, wounded
man. Likewise, Mitchell
is magnetic to watch as
Laura, who at first seems
to have her life figured
out, but from whom we
see a different side when
her confident facade
begins to crumble as the
play goes on. Both, we
see, are broken in a way
the other could fix. As the
night wears on, we can’t
help but want to push them
together, urge them to sort
things out, and wonder
where will it end: a one
night stand or parenthood
and a life together ?
What is remarkable
about the play is how real
it all seems. As Laura and
Danny live out the night on
Fly Davis’ richly detailed
set, we could be peeking
through the windows into
the ungainly, fumbling
beginnings of a real re-
lationship. It takes a rare
talent to craft and bring to
life characters with such
vividness, especially ones
that linger in the mind like
these ones do. After a long
absence, this is a welcome
return to the forefront of
British theatre for David
Eldridge. Beginning is
magnificent – don’t miss
it.
