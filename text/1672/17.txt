Black Mirror – What is it good for?
As the real world gets progressively more insane, Andrew Melville asks whether we still need dystopian sci-fi.

Student will
be a stranger
to technology, I imagine
notallshareBlackMirror’s
pessimistic view of tech
as an existential threat.
Despite creator Charlie
Brooker claiming that his
show is more warning than
fear-mongering, the show
focuses on how technolo-
gy exacerbates the flaws in
human nature. Rather than
taking the Wachowskian
approach to dystopia that
was popular at the turn of
the century and have tech-
nology enslave humans,
Black Mirror shows
us what happens when
technology liberates us to
be the worst versions of
ourselves; it takes plausi-
ble ideas based in our own
reality and extends those
to what could happen soon
if we don’t sit up and take
notice. But as we enter a
surreal age of misinforma-
tion, where TV stars rule
countries and automation
slides ever closer to re-
ality, is a dismal forecast
the best way to inspire a
healthier discussion about
technology and its place in
our future?
Some might argue that
Black Mirror’s bedtime
stories aren’t necessary in
today’s political climate.
The show does have a
long history of seeming
to predict notable news
stories: David Cameron’s
pig fracas could have
inspired the central
plotline in The National
Anthem, China’s proposed
social rating system is a
direct rip of Nosedive,
and many might find
the election of an odd-
ly-coloured, populist tel-
evision star in The Waldo
Moment vaguely reminis-
cent of President Trump’s
surprise election win late
last year. These bizarre
coincidences are less
indicative of Brooker’s
ability to read the future,
however, than they are of
an increasingly surreal po-
litico-technological land-
scape. Research shows
that we enjoy horror and
thrillers as it allows us to
experience these emotions
in a controlled environ-
ment, and probably also
explains my love of crying
at Marley and Me. But as
that controlled environ-
ment starts to looks more
and more like what we
see on our screens, these
films and shows become
more than just a cathartic
release of emotion. It’s as
if that girl from The Ring
has just crawled out of the
television, except she’s an
iPhone with facial recog-
nition software.
Black Mirror can only
get as scary as Charlie
Brooker can imagine, but
reality is not bound by one
man’s imagination, and
technology seems primed
“Black Mirror
can only be as
scary as Charlie
Brooker’s
imagination,
but reality is
not bound”
“We must take
appropriate
action to
ensure that
when these
technologies
do take over
we are ready”
to make any episode look
quite cosy in comparison.
Just this year we’ve seen
how misinformation can
take control of electoral
processes (I know it’s
not just me that has an
old aunt or weird cousin
that shared some bullshit
about Corbyn). Meme
culture promotes opinion
over fact, as being in on
what is effectively a glo-
rified inside joke is more
appealing than engaging
in discussion. Rightly or
wrongly, the Momentum/
Moggmentum movements
have already played a
huge part in June’s general
election, increasing the
youth vote by 20% this
summer. The part that the
internet and memes have
played is not to be under-
stated.
This phenomenon of
confirmation culture is
not even restricted to
followers of political
candidates. Trump’s oft
repeated “Fake News” is
not only emblematic of
the problem, but also the
reason many are distrustful
of news that don’t serve to
confirm what they already
believe. Thousands see
this disregard for tradi-
tional news media to be
refreshing: a welcome
break from the boring
bureaucracy of politics.
Expensively produced
execution and recruitment
videos on IsisTV (Channel
608) also serve to make
politics and war more
exciting, bringing the
horrors of the battlefield
more in line with what
we’ve come to expect,
except without James
Bond saving the day. Far
from encouraging produc-
tive debate, platforms like
Twitter and Facebook only
serve to amplify what we
are already comfortable
in believing and keep our
echo chambers sound-
proof. News stories are
shared a thousand times
before someone looks
at the sources. Is it any
wonder we turn to TV for
nice, simple problems to
solve like swarms of killer
bees?
Brooker isn’t alone in
his mistrust in humanity’s
obsession with the ad-
vancement of technology.
Black Mirror is just the
latest dystopian sci-fi,
counting classics like
1984, The Matrix, and
Blade Runner as its an-
cestors. In many of these
early dystopias, humans
eventually win out against
tech, and return to a har-
monious world, but Black
Mirror does not afford us
this reassurance, choosing
to emphasise the control
devices can and will
have if our usage of them
goes unchecked. Like its
predecessors, the show
focuses on how the way
humans use technology
is bad, rather than tech-
nology being inherently
awful. This suggests that
dystopian horror is not a
given, as long as we use
tech for good, rather than
compounding the worst
parts of human nature.
Not all sci-fi landscapes
set in the near future
imagine it as a haunted
house of devices. The
most positive vision of our
future in recent memory
is Spike Jonze’s Her.
Sure, the neon lights and
high-rise buildings are
present as we’ve come to
expect, but Her gives us a
bright walk through what
life could look like. This
optimism is reflected in
the films colour palette:
bright blues and deep
reds mirror the setting,
where technology allows
people to pursue artistic
endeavours. Wide open
cityscapes are a welcome
contrast to the cramped
alien worlds that usually
occupy our screens. This
future could be ours in the
next 20 years, provided
that we are able to strike
the right balance with
automation.
The right approach
to a world increasingly
dominated by and depend-
ant on our computers is
somewhere between these
two extremes. Dating your
operating system is no
better advice than giving
up tech for good. We must
be aware of the dangers
that automation, virtual
reality, and AI pose to our
happiness, and take appro-
priate action to ensure that
when these technologies
do take over (and I believe
they will) we are ready for
them. My prognosis is a
return to the excitement
for technological ad-
vancement popular in the
1950s, with a healthy dose
of scepticism of human
self-regulation.
Black Mirror is availa-
ble on Netflix and with any
malevolent consciousness
that may or may not be
taking your job.
