C o a s t
excited for a week of
sailing. EY Sailing, based
in Lefkada, offered us an
excellent deal for cruising
the Ionian islands and were
amazing hosts, showing
us beautiful spots as we
sailed between islands,
enabling us to enjoy Greek
hospitality to its fullest.
We were met by Costas
at the airport. He took us to
an air-conditioned minibus
and, after a short transfer,
we pulled up right next to
our boat, Lito, a Bavaria
44 cruiser (44-foot long).
Perfect for enjoying the
Mediterranean and island
hopping, it had plenty of
space for all eight of us.
Elias, our skipper and
and co-owner of EY
sailing, greeted us on
the comfortable yacht.
Having set ourselves up
in our cabins we joined
Elias on deck and had
a relaxed but thorough
briefing on the important
parts of boat living. This
not only featured sailing
aspects of the yacht and
safety, but also free-diving
and spear-fishing, some-
thing that EY also focus
on. Elias made us feel
completely at home and
continued to tell us about
the Ionian islands, Greek
food, and island lifestyle.

sailing and water activ-
ities, who offered such
amazing local knowledge
and sincere hospitality.
Moored up stern to,
right by the town, we
ventured into Lefkada for
our first dinner, eating at a
reasonably priced restau-
rant, considered one of the
best in the area. Octopus,
squid, mussels, and local
fish were washed down
by Greek wine before we
headed back to the yacht
for our first night aboard.
After a good night’s
sleep and a Greek coffee
the next morning, we
could sense that we had a
great week lined up. When
we got to unfurl the sails
the yahct was surprisingly
agile and light for its size.
Lito was a joy to sail and
easy for even our less ex-
perienced crew to handle.
Throughout the week
we stopped off at other
islands – Kastos, Ithaca,
and Kefalonia. Kastos
was a tiny island of only
40 residents during the
summer and fewer in the
winter when the facilities
close. We went ashore
and enjoyed a drink in at
a table alongside an old
windmill and then went
swimming from a rocky
beach nearby.
At Ithaca we had several
stops. A larger island than
Kastos but still only just
over 3000 inhabitants.
Again great food, refresh-
ing swimming but also an
archaeological museum
with ancient Greek items
that have been found on the
island. Naturally, touring
the Greek Islands with a
local free-diver led us to
some absolutely beautiful
swimming locations, both
under and above the water.
The icing on the cake was
watching Elias go down
and spear our dinner which
he prepared on board (later
in the trip we took another
catch to a restaurant who
cooked it for us).
Kefalonia was another
stop, a much larger Ionian
island with a population
in excess of 30,000. We
took the opportunity to
visit a well known tourist
site, the beautiful lake
of Melissani Cave on
Kefalonia – a water-filled
cave with a collapsed roof
open to the sky. Another
incredible location was
what Elias knows as Crack
End, almost unknown to
others visiting the islands,
and a secret location that
I can’t even reveal in this
article – one that has to be
seen to be appreciated!
Throughout the week
we split our time between
these island outings and
boat living. Diving in from
the deck into crystal clear
water, swinging from the
halyard, “hydro-massage”
(being pulled along behind
the boat), and swimming
to beautiful locations only
accessible from the sea
were all truly exhilarating.
Our friends at EY
sailing gave us an unfor-
gettable experience out on
the Ionian Sea, and we’re
certain to be returning next
year. Feel free to email
ICYC, and ask us any
questions about the Greek
tour, China Cup Regatta,
the EDHEC Regatta in
France, and weekend trips
we run regularly down in
the Solent. We also hope to
bring in some educational
courses to let our members
learn about sailing before
even hitting the water or
to gain the qualifications
they’re looking for.
