Can graphic design save your life?
W

Collection
is one of
the best
museums in London: they
hold large blockbuster
exhibitions that dip into
a small section of Henry
Wellcome’s collection,
easily one of the largest
private collections that has
ever existed.
Wellcome was interest-
ed in human health and
medicine with his ultimate
aim: to create a museum
than spanned all of human
civilization. Over his life
he acquired a collection so
large that later generations
of staff took to describing
its contents by the tonne.
After his death in 1936
his collection was still
stored in vast warehouses,
unseen and incomplete. It
would take the Wellcome
Trust until 2007 to open
the museum to the public
and display a fraction of
Henry’s objects.
With an infinity of
objects, the Collection’s
exhibitions are usually
incredibly dense, with
normal visits lasting three
or more hours. To regulars,
the first thing you will
notice is the sparseness of
the space for Can Graphic
Design Save Your Life?
The experience is
swift and quick with
visits peaking at around
an hour, and sections
centred around topics like
persuasion, education,
hospitalisation and con-
tagion. Objects are given
vast spaces, and this may
be in part because almost
all are printed: advertising
posters, photos, pharmacy
bags, stamps, a 17th
Century lift-the-flap book.
Highlights include a
particularly fascinating
display on Saatchi &
Saatchi’s advertising
campaign for Silk Cut
cigarettes and an image
of artist Stephen Doe
painting symptoms of
Ebola on a wall, to inform
citizens during the height
of the 2014 outbreak in
Liberia.

project was announced at
Wellcome’s Call to Action
conference in Berlin last
week. The conference
gathered government
ministers, scientists, and
industry and civil society
leaders together to discuss
how to tackle this global
health threat.
The rapid spread of
superbugs poses a great
risk to human health, in-
creasing length of hospital
stays and mortality rates.
Left unchecked, even-
tually routine surgical
procedures such as
infections; however,
predicted numbers show
that this may rise to 10
million people a year by
2050. Dr Jeremy Farrar,

and deaths caused by drug

Scientists from the Uni-

Data Institute, the Centre
for Tropical Medicine,
and The Institute of Health
Metrics and Evaluation,
University of Washington,
will collaborate on this
research with additional
funding provided by the
UK government and the
Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation. Additionally,
Wellcome launched a new
expert group – the Surveil-
lance and Epidemiology of
Drug Resistant Infections
Consortium (SEDRIC) to
enable better global data
sharing strategies on drug
resistant infections.

The question raised by Wellcome Collection’s latest exhibition probably isn’t one that is asked often enough.
experience that allows for
deeper exploration of what
it means to be human.
Can Graphic Design
Save Your Life? feels like
Wellcome-lite. It has good
content but doesn’t pack
that signature emotive
punch. But the key to great
design is not noticing how
well it works, have I been
duped? I think not.
Can Graphic Design
Save Your Life? is on at
Wellcome Collection until
14th January 2018.
“The exhibition
can feel a bit
like Wellcome-
lite”
It would be interesting
to ask the curators if they
set out to persuade with
their exhibit, or whether
they assumed, like I
did, that the answer to
their question was yes.
Normally, the Collection’s
exhibitions really chal-
