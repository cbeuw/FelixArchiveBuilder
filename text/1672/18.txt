is so diffi-
cult when
you don’t
have anyone suggesting
“maybe you want to write
about that?”, or when you
just don’t feel inspired to
write about their sugges-
tions. So, while I struggled
with finding a topic for
this page, I realised that I
did not say “Hi!” to you
this year. So, here I am!
So good to see you again
this year! Oh, you missed
me? That’s so nice of you.
Of course, I missed you
too. But we don’t want to
talk about me too much
straight from the begin-
ning, do we? I mean, I
think you are here to enjoy
your first term back at uni.
Yey – very enthusiastic
‘yey’ – just so it’s clear I
am not sarcastic here.
So, for all of you return-
ing, it’s nice to be back,
isn’t it? So many friends
you haven’t seen over the
summer! So many exotic
souvenirsandgiftsbrought
from… exotic places. You
You will need...
1. Bring the noodles to a boil in plain water, with
no added salt.
2. While that’s cooking, cut the carrot and the
parsley root in fine sticks and boil them for up to
5 minutes.
3. Try to multitask and fry the diced beef with
the soy sauce, olive oil, and 1 finely chopped gar-
lic clove.
4. In a separate stockpot, place the remaining
garlic cloves, soy sauce, and olive oil. Add the
slices of ginger, chilli powder, and the beef stock
(or the water with the stock cube). Bring to the
boil, then reduce to simmer for 5 minutes.
5. In a soup bowl, arrange the noodles . On top of
it arrange the beef and the veggies, along with half
a boiled egg. Add the stock in the bowl and finally
sprinkle with spring onions on top.
6. Now you can call your mom and tell her
you’ve made the best soup in the world (or ac-
knowledge that you are a failure who cannot even
make a simple soup).

get me. But you’re also
back to: oh, shit, I have to
cook again (finally, after
spending your first weeks
eating instant noodles)!
Yes, you’ve cooked over
the summer too (unless
you went home and your
mommy did it for you,
you lucky bastard), but
now you don’t really have
the time you need to try
and fail at one recipe three
times.
For the ones here for the
first time, welcome to the
freak show! It’s time you
actually read this section
– I know you ignored it
the first weeks because
• 5-6 cups of water (very basic,
but just in case you expected it to
materialise in your pot)
•Stock cube (preferably beef) – or
replace it and the equivalent water
with 3 cups of beef stock
• 1 tbsp olive oil
• Dash of chilli powder
• 2-3 slices of ginger
• 2-3 tbsp soy sauce
• 3-4 garlic cloves
• 300g ramen noodles
• 300g diced beef (or any meat you
want
• 1 big carrot
• ½ parsley root
• 4 asparagus spears
• 1 egg, hard boiled
• Sliced green spring onions
you thought you don’t
need food advice. But I
also know you haven’t
boiled an egg in your
life, and maybe you don’t
even know how to use a
microwave. If that’s the
case, please ask for help
before you blow anything
up. Yes, your journey will
be slow and painful, but in
the end you will manage
to actually gain weight,
rather than die of starva-
tion. Trust me on this one.
No matter the case, I
know you all miss some-
thing, especially now that
all the Freshers’ week
excitement is gone; maybe
you miss your warm cosy
bed or your soft teddy
bear, even if you don’t
admit it; maybe you miss
food that actually tastes
of things; maybe you
miss your mom’s pyrogy
(I might have a weakness
for these, you see) or your
father’s instant noodles.
Damn, maybe you miss
your cactus. No matter
how much you protest,
you miss something.
Here’s how to cure this
feeling, in a faster, cheaper
way than taking a train/
plane/boat/magic carpet
back home: soup! Yes,
you’ve heard me right.
Soup is just magic enough
to help cure things – from
fresher’s flu to loneliness.
Soup is definitely not the
most popular food among
students, but it’s nice and
not that complicated. You
might actually make a
tasty one on your first try.
And it’s quick enough that
you can still go to all the
parties/society meeting/
dance classes you planned.
Oh, look at me talking
so much. You’ll get used
to that too. Eventually.
Let’s cut the suspense
and jump straight into the
recipe, shall we?
It’s about time you started learning how to look after and cook for yourselves, and where better to start than soup!
Let our soup recipe sooth your freshers’ flu and mid-term blues.
As you’ve probably imagined already, this is
more of a ramen than an English (or, rather,
European) soup, but it’s still very nice and
definitely tastes great.
Will your soup look this good? Probably not, but oh well // Andrada Balmez
