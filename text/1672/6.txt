It’s time for students at Imperial to make their
voices heard
The Autumn Elections are just the beginning. Your representatives need you to get involved,
and come to them with your views – otherwise nothing will change.
COMMENT
Michael Edwards
RCSU President
T
oday marks
the end of this
year’s Autumn
Elections. For
many of you this will have
been your first Imperial
College Union election,
and it’s been a brilliant
one all round: many of our
representative positions, in
particular within the Royal
College of Science Union
(RCSU) departments,
were heavily contested;
our Council elections have
been the most contested in
‘living memory’, attract-
ing 49 candidates for 16
seats on the Union’s top
democratic decision-mak-
ing board. Congratulations
to those of you who have
won positions, and thanks
to all who took part in the
process this time round.
But this isn’t the end
of your chance to have
a say in what goes on at
Imperial. Far from it – this
is the beginning.
With the newly-elected
representatives the Union
can now turn its full at-
tention into representing
our views – the views of
the students at College
– at important College
meetings, such as depart-
mental and Faculty level
staff-student committees
and liaison groups. Rather
than switching off after
yet another election, this is
the time where you should
remain critically engaged.
Imperial students are
known for being apathet-
ic. In the past we haven’t
raised our heads when
our courses are changed
against our best interests,
and we’ve accepted poor
pastoral care and academic
teaching. We see ourselves
as customers of a rigidly
pre-defined educational
product that is set in stone
and cannot be changed: a
stepping stone on the way
to a cosy job in Canary
Wharf or the Square
Mile. It’s something that
has been forced on us by
society by the increase in
tuition fees and other gov-
ernment policy affecting
universities. College, with
its increasingly corporate
attitude, certainly isn’t
helping.
We’re seeing all parts
of our community, staff,
and students, calling out
poorly-made decisions
by opaque divisions in
Sherfield. In meetings
with senior departmental
and Faculty staff, we often
find ourselves on the same
page with the people we
represent your views to.
They’re just as confound-
ed at the poor response
and engagement as we are,
and are willing to make
sweeping and positive
changes. They just need
to know what changes we
want them to make.
Your Academic and
Wellbeing representatives
are the conduit between
you and your Depart-
mental staff, the people
who you have chosen to
be the trusted voices of
your cohort. Their views
and their complaints will
be taken seriously, and
anything they raise in
an official forum will be
considered and dealt with.
However, they need to
know about the issues and
problems that you face in
your course so that they
can act. So I issue the
following call to action.
We need a culture
ment. In the aftermath of
this election season, make
sure to find out who your
Year and Department
Representative are. Try
and identify them, and in-
troduce yourself to them.
Whenever you have an
issue with coursework or a
lecture course, bring it up
with them – it’s likely that
other people will have the
same issue, and your rep
is just waiting for enough
evidence to act. Never
assume that someone else
will complain for you –
always stand up and point
out where something feels
likeitcouldbemadebetter.
It’s not just on us though:
academic staff need to
see us as partners in our
learning and the wider
‘Imperial experience’
rather than adversaries or
whiny children. We know
how best we learn, and
by banding together and
voicing what we think, we
can effect change for the
better.
We need to remember
that democracy isn’t just
voting every now and then
for our representatives and
delegating all responsibil-
ity to them. Democracy
is being able to continue
having your own voice
heard after you’ve left the
polling booth. My goal for
this year is to expand and
broaden democracy within
the Faculty of Natural
Sciences by upholding
this principle and ensuring
you can continuously
and effectively have your
voice heard through your
representatives, and I call
upon the other Constituent
Unions – and you, the
student body – to join us
in our endeavour to truly
make Imperial College
Union the most democrat-
ic Student’s Union in the
UK.

“In the past,
we haven’t
raised our

our courses
are changed

best interests,
and have
accepted poor
pastoral care”
change here at Imperial.
We all need to become
more active participants
in our own learning,
celebrating the best in
educational practice and
calling out poor practice
that is in need of improve-

remember that
democracy
isn’t just
voting now
and then, and
delegating all
responsibility”
