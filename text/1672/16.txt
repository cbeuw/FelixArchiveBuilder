es around the world may be
suffering from blockbuster
fatigue. The summer of
2017 has been something
of a graveyard for sequels,
reboots and franchises,
and film studios will have
to reconsider how they
approach audiences, both
domestic and foreign, if
they wish to revive the
spectacle of the summer
movie season. Studio
executives could probably
learn a few lessons by
paying attention to some
of the lower budget films
that managed to exceed
box office expectations
this summer.
Without a doubt, the
most successful low-
budget production of the
year will be Jordan Peele’s
Get Out. The film, which
finds horror in casual
racism, has attracted unan-
imous praise ever since its
mid-March release. Critics
have lavished it with rave
reviews and some have
even penned it for a Best
Picture nomination as
Hollywood gears up for
Oscar season. And that’s
not all: against a $4.5
million budget, the film
has pulled in a whopping
$253.1 million world-
wide, meaning that it
will probably be the most
profitable film of the year.
So, how exactly did this
film – a directorial debut
for Peele and starring a
semi-notable cast – wind
up as one of the bona fide
hits of 2017?
For that, we have to
turn to its two-pronged
elements – a culturally
relevant racial commen-
tary mounted against
a backdrop of satirical
horror. On the other hand,
stellar reviews, roughly
200 pre-release screenings
and over 6 million trailer
views on YouTube, all
worked in tandem to cul-
tivate favourable word-of-
mouth and propel the film
to a $33.4 million opening
weekend. The film’s
buzz continued well after
release and on its second
weekend, its ticket sales
had dropped only 15.4%
relative to its opening
weekend – significant,
because horror films gen-
erally post second-week-
end drops of at least 60%.
Get Out’s success is
even more surprising
because it was released
in February – one of the
so-called “dump months”
where audiences are
smaller and theatres in
North America typically
expect much fewer ticket
sales. To simply say that
Get Out “defies expecta-
tions” is a lazy statement,
because the film does so
much more than that. It is a
film that has attracted tons
of ticket sales and critical
praise, while seemingly
defying every Hollywood
rule about how movies
attract tons of ticket sales
and critical praise. Get
Out’s unique pattern of
success was mirrored
throughout the summer by
other low-budget releases
such as Atomic Blonde,
Girls Trip and Baby
Driver – films that didn’t
have a war chest to spend
on advertising, but still
managed to draw large
audiences into theatres by
relying on strong reviews
and social media buzz.
Atomic Blonde, the
neon-lit 80s spy thriller
directed by David Leitch
(John Wick), garnered
favourable reviews and
pulled in a respectable
$95.7 million worldwide
against a budget of $30
million, even while
opening only one week
after Christopher Nolan’s
war epic, Dunkirk. Girls
Trip, another sleeper hit,
became the first comedy
in 2017 to gross over
$100 million in the North
American market, and
so far has topped out at
$136.3 million worldwide.
It’s worth noting that
while Girls Trip has made
over 84% of its revenue
domestically (in the North
American market), other
sleeper hits like Baby
Driver ($226.3 million
worldwide gross; $34
million budget) and Split
($278 million worldwide
gross; $9 million budget)
have been able to generate
almost equal amounts
of domestic and foreign
revenue.
Girls Trip’s concentrat-
ed popularity in the U.S.
is not unusual, since its
storyline seems heavily
geared towards that
market; a phenomenon
also mirrored by the
success of Dunkirk in the
U.K. While Dunkirk has
managed to pull in $522.9
million worldwide, $73.7
million of that has come
from the combined U.K.
and Ireland market – this
is notable, given that
the combined U.K. and
Ireland market generally
contributes less than 10%
to the worldwide revenues
of most Hollywood
blockbusters. Dunkirk’s
popularity in the U.K. has
made it the second-highest
grossing film at the 2017
U.K. box office, missing
out on first place to
Disney’s Beauty and the
Beast, which is currently
the highest-grossing film
of the year at the global
box office.
The success of low-
budget films like Get Out
and Atomic Blonde, as
well as market-specific
targets like Girls Trip and
Dunkirk, lends credence to
the claim that the average
moviegoer is beginning
to care more about novel
and unique cinematic ex-
periences, opposed to the
latest Marvel superhero
instalment, Paramount
Pictures sequel, or Warner
Bros. remake.
I could say more about
the creeping threat of
streaming platforms,
the curious success of
animated movies, or the
money-making machine
that is Marvel Studios,
but in doing so, I would
probablystretchthisarticle
by a couple thousand
words – a bit excessive
given that we’re already
in 2-page territory here.
Nonetheless, these topics
are indeed important and
they provide some unique
insights into where the
film and TV industries are
headed over the next few
years. I will be exploring
them in future editions of
Felix, so stay tuned to read
about it. As for now, it
seems safe to say that with
the 2017 summer movie
season, we witnessed a
juxtaposition of fortunes.
Audiences were treated
to both high-budget
blockbusters and low-
budget novelties, and will
undoubtedly be hoping for
similarly varied offerings
next year; film studios on
the other hand, will likely
be revisiting their assump-
tions about what kinds of
movies make money. The
ground is shifting beneath
their feet and a fog is
obscuring their vision, so
they will need to find their
bearings quickly or risk
extinction at the hands of a
future box office blunder.

epending on
who you are,
the summer
movie season
was either a blessing or a
disaster.
For film studio
executives, it was un-
questionably dismal.
There was little comfort
in watching each new
release miss its box
office targets. On Labour
Day Weekend – the long
summer weekend in the
United States where
film studios often expect
major ticket sales – the
U.S. box office had
its worst performance
in 17 years: the top
twelve films grossed a
combined $51.5 million
and you have to go
back to 2000, when
the top twelve grossed
$47 million, to find a
worse performance. No
doubt some film studio
executives have already
began questioning their
tentative summer 2018
releases, wondering
whether some of those
big budget productions
might need a few re-
writes, lest they suffer
the same fate as some
of this year’s box office
flops.
On the other side of
the aisle however, film
critics and casual mov-
iegoers were spoilt for
choice by the variety of
films on offer. Wonder
Woman, Spider-Man:
Homecoming and Guard-
ians of Galaxy Vol. 2
rounded out the annual
instalment of superhero
flicks, while lower
budget productions like
Get Out, Atomic Blonde
and Girls Trip offered
audiences something
other than the avalanche
of family-friendly
crowd-pleasers that have
traditionally dominated
the summer movie
season.
In summers past,
almost all high budget
productions – those with
budgets exceeding $100
million – were usually
viewed as guaranteed
successes by major
film studios. Instead
of acquiring an army
of screenwriters and
producers that could
marshal a film towards
Academy Award glory,
studios focused their fi-
nancial firepower on de-
veloping special effects
bonanzas that would
capture the attention of
audiences worldwide;
because as lovely as an
Oscar nomination may
be, it matters little if
you don’t have enough
money to run your film
studio in the first place.
Consequently, major
film studios like Uni-
versal, Warner Bros.,
and 20th Century Fox,
all developed appetites
for producing high-
budget blockbusters.
Just consider the case
of the Transformers
franchise: the first four
films were all box office
hits; released over the
7-year period from
2007 to 2014, each film
managed to gross over
$700 million worldwide,
and the third and fourth
instalments in particular
succeeded in cracking
the $1 billion mark. By
the end of 2014, all four
films occupied top-ten
slots in Paramount
Pictures’ list of its
highest-grossing films
worldwide. Given such
runaway success, the
executives at Paramount
were in no rush to drop
the Transformers fran-
chise any time soon.
Fast-forward to 2017
and we have our fifth
instalment in the series,
Transformers: The Last
Knight. Despite being
armed with a budget of
$217 million and mar-
keting spending likely
exceeding $100 million,
the film has “only”
managed to gross $605.4
million in the four
months since its release.
To understand why this
is bad, you first have to
understand the differ-
ence between ticket sales
in the North American
market (where all major
Hollywood film studios
are headquartered) and
ticket sales in foreign
markets.
When a movie ticket
for a wide release film
is sold – say for around
$10 – that revenue is
split between several
entities. If sold in the
North American market,
around $4 may go to the
not an isolated incident,
it mirrors a general trend
over the summer 2017
movie season.
Pirates of the Carib-
bean: Dead Men Tell No
Tales suffered the lowest
North American gross
and the second-lowest
worldwide gross out of
any film in the series,
pulling in $794 million
worldwide against a
$230 million budget,
with roughly 78% of that
revenue coming from
foreign markets – the
highest such percentage
in the series 14-year
history.
Universal’s reboot of
The Mummy didn’t fare
much better: the film
grossed $80.1 million in
North America and $329
million in other terri-
tories for a worldwide
total of $409.1 million,
against a combined pro-
duction and advertising
budget of around $345
million. And of course,
due to the thinner profits
from foreign markets,
Universal will likely lose
in excess of $75 million
from their investment in
this film.
It doesn’t end there:
the co-produced Warner
Bros. and Legendary
Pictures epic, Kong:
Skull Island, grossed
$168 million in North
America and $398.6
million in foreign
markets for a worldwide
total of $566.6 million.
Made on a production
budget of $185 million
and fuelled by a $136
million marketing
campaign, this franchise
reboot needed to make at
least $450-500 million
worldwide for Warner
Bros. and Legendary
Pictures to break even.
What does this string of
box office failures tell us?
Well, for starters, audienc-

theatre showcasing the
film and the remaining
$6 to the film studio that
produced it, but if sold
in a foreign market, the
film studio may only get
$2, since the studio will
typically have to rely on
several intermediaries
to distribute its films in
international markets.
So, when the latest
Transformers instalment
grosses $130.2 million
in North America and
$475.2 million interna-
tionally, compared to
its predecessor’s $245.4
million North American
and $858.6 million inter-
national gross, then the
film is rightly viewed as
a box office disappoint-
ment.
