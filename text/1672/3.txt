The survey comes
following displeasure
over changes to
campus services
carried out over the
summer, including
removal of SCR cooked
breakfasts

A
survey of
campus ser-
vices has been
launched by
Imperial College Union
following “significant
changes” to Imperial’s
catering and dining
facilities. The move
comes more than two
months after the Col-
lege’s Campus Services
implemented changes
without consulting staff
or students.
The changes are largely
cost-cutting measures.
These include reducing
menu options, portion
sizes, and opening hours,
in addition to replacing
F-EAST in the Junior
Common Room with Jap-
anese outlet Tanpopo.
The Imperial College
website claims that these
P
rotesters gath-
ered outside the
Iraqi embassy
on Queen’s Gate
earlier this week in reac-
tion to Iraq’s seizure of
the city of Kirkuk from
Pro-Kurdish protesters gather outside Iraqi Embassy
Kurdish forces who had
occupied it for the past
three years.
Last Monday, 18th
October, a group of
demonstrators took to the
speech, carrying Kurdish
flags and chanting slogans
like “long live Kurdistan,
long live freedom.”
Police closed off a part
of Queen’s Gate in both
directions, and maintained
a heavy presence. Fire and
ambulance services were
also on the scene.
Footage posted on
social media shows pro-
testers throwing objects at
the building and smashing
windows. Other scenes
depict a number of dem-
onstrators trying to break
down the door to the
embassy. One managed
to enter the building and
remove an Iraqi flag,
which they threw to the
ground and stamped on.
Protesters arrived at the
embassy, which is located
opposite the Blackett and
Huxley buildings, shortly
after 4pm. They remained
in the area for over an hour
before dispersing. Scot-
land Yard confirmed that
two people had entered the
building, but that nobody
was arrested.
The protests and
seizure of Kirkuk comes
three weeks after Kurds
voted for independence.
Although Kirkuk lies
outside the borders of the
autonomous Kurdistan
region, it has been home
to more than one million
Kurds since Iraqi forces
abandoned the city in
2014 to fight Islamic
State. The area is rich in
oil, which it primarily
exports to Turkey. Trade
between Kurdistan and
Turkey is worth more
than £7.4 billion a year.
Despite this, Turkish
president Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan has threatened
to shut down business
relations in an attempt
to set aside the result of
the referendum. Kurdish
leader Masoud Barzani
has urged the international
community for peace. He
said: “We are committed
to a dialogue process with
Baghdad. Threats will
solve nothing.”
NEWS
changes will benefit the
wider community. It also
makes note of how much
investment in catering
facilities costs, making a
point to mention “these
services operate at a loss”
and are heavily subsidised.
Despite this, Imperial’s
2015-16 accounts reported
an overall surplus income
of £84.5 million.
The website adds that
the changes should have
a minimal impact on stu-
dents and staff. However,
as Felix reported this
August, postgraduate stu-
dents and staff were dis-
pleased when the Senior
Common Room stopped
serving breakfast. Since
then, complaints have
continued to come in, with
one Imperial academic
telling Felix: “I have re-
ceived several complaints
from our students: they
usually only get one hour
to eat between lectures
and are not happy to
spend their lunch break in
a queue or finding a seat.
They do not have time to
eat and relax.”
He added: “The other
day I tried to get my
lunch at 12.15, between
two meetings, and I only
had 30 minutes to eat. I
usually grab a sandwich
at the JCR but that was
not an option because of
the massive queues. I tried
several other food outlets
with no luck – there were
long queues everywhere. I
went to my meeting with
an empty stomach and
had lunch at 2pm.” The
College told Felix that
they “aim to provide the
best possible service and
experience for our staff
and student community.”
The Union told Felix
that they were conducting
the Campus Services
Feedback survey “to better
understand the opinions of
our members regarding the
changes which occurred
over the summer to the
Campus Services outlets,
and to gain a deeper
insight into the consumer
habits across the Imperial
community.”
The Graduate Students’
Union (GSU) has urged
Imperial to listen to
students’ feedback and
reconsider the changes. In
a statement, the GSU told
Felix: “These changes, al-
though financially rational
on the College’s part, send
the wrong message to our
postgraduate community,
especially considering
how much we value equal
provision and opportuni-
ties for both undergraduate
and postgraduate students.
Many students have ap-
proached us expressing a
feeling of neglect.”
In a statement from the
Union, a representative
said that “With a good
response rate from our
membersandfromCollege
staff, we will be better
placed to lobby College
to adapt the services to
better serve our members
and challenge them when
appropriate.”
Launching the feedback
survey is a step in the
right direction. Aside from
gathering demographic in-
formation, it asks student
which outlets they use
and when, as well as when
they would like to use the
outlets. There are no men-
tions of other issues raised
by staff and students
– such as the changes to
Ethos’ opening hours – al-
though a comment box is
provided at the end of the
survey.
