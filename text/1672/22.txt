With a ‘No Deal’
Brexit on the horizon,
Imperial have had
to cut down on this
year’s graduation
expenditure

T
he looming
potential of a
‘No-Deal’ Brexit
has meant that
Imperial College has cut
back on graduation ex-
penditure this year.
A report published last
week by Sussex Univer-
sity claimed that leaving
the EU without a trade
deal would dramatically
increase the cost of living
in the UK. Experts also
believe higher educa-
tion funding could be
particularly vulnerable
post-Brexit.
As a result, the College
last week announced their
changes to graduation,
which they described on
their website as “a bold
step forward for cash-
strapped higher education
institutions, while also
giving students a person-
place in the Royal Albert
Hall, this year the venue
wasonlyopentothosewho
has purchased an optional
“Pomp & Circumstance
Upgrade”, priced at £50 a
head. Those who opted to
not buy the upgrade had to
collect their degree from
the Sherfield sub-base-
ment instead.
For those graduating in
the Royal Albert Hall –
which was standing-only
in order to generate more
ticket sales – the ceremony
remained largely the same,
bar a change to the hand-
shake protocol. While in
previous years students
would shake the hand of
an Imperial luminary, this
year the option was only
available to those who
pre-booked the handshake
add-on, which cost £16.95.
Degrees were handed
out on a first-come, first-
serve basis, with queues
stretching past the Albert
Memorial as students
tried to get the best spot.
“I actually worked really
hard in my last year,” one
student told Felix, “and
I was supposed to get a
first in biochemistry, but
I slept through my alarm
and turned up late, so now
I’ve got a 2:2 in maths
instead.”
Felix spoke to James
and Nicola Garside,
who were at Imperial to
see their son graduate:
“we don’t come down
to London often, so we
thought we’d make a full
day of it. We purchased
the ‘Diamond Level Ex-
clusive Graduation Pack’,
which we were told would
include ‘luxury canapes
and wine’. When we
arrived for the reception,
we got a choice between
a glass of lambrini or a
half-pint of Bud Light,
and some carrot sticks.”
Photography rights
are another area where
the College were able
to recoup their funding.
As part of their deal with
Temptress Photogra-
phy, the company were
given full rights over all
photos taken on Imperial
property, including those
taken on personal devices.
Any patrons caught taking
selfies or posing with
their family outside the
Business School would be
The changes to grad-
uation day are part of
a wider set of austerity
measures being pursued
by the College, which also
include removal of the
SCR breakfasts, replacing
70% of course modules
with YouTube-based
lectures, and swapping
Wednesday afternoon time
off with mandatory “Mine
Bitcoin for Imperial!”
sessions.
Felix got in contact
with Mike Hammerson,
Vice Provost (Gradu-
ation), who said “the
potential of Brexit has
made things financially
difficult for the College
this year. However, we
really wanted to make
sure that our graduands
had a celebratory day to
look forward to. After all,
graduation is really about
celebrating students’
hard work, spending time
with friends and family,
and making a fuckton of
dosh.”

fine of £30; alternatively,
they could pay £25 and
have the images turned
into commemorative key-
chains.

This week you’re at
your graduation, and the
person behind you won’t
stop chatting through the
whole ceremony. Shut the
fuck up, we’re all bored.
This week you go
to sports night and get
punched in the face. Turns
out people are really upset
you swapped Stella with
Bud Light.
This week you’re Alice
Gast, and people keep
asking to shake your hand
in the Royal Albert Hall.
Not sure why, but they
seem nice enough.
This week you decide
to venture into the JCR to
grab a bite to eat at rush
hour. You’re never seen
again.
This week you think
the sky turning sepia is
a sign of the end of the
world, so you decide to
tell your housemate about
your undying love for
him. It’s a bit awkward
now.
This week you’re
a sports club, and
graduation means you
can’t do your usual
Wednesday night activity:
hogging space at 568’s
bar. THEY DON’T EVEN
GO HERE ANY MORE.
This week you get
caught up in a protest,
and end up smashing an
embassy window. You
thought it was about the
College taking away the
SCR breakfast, but turns
out not. Whoops.
This week you are
the Felix Editor, and the
servers are down. You’ve
got to move to the Union
offices to complete the
paper. Nobody will talk to
you, but at least you get to
use their ball pit.
This week you are the
student voice, and you’re
raised louder than ever!
The screaming never
stops.
This week, you’re Vice
Provost (Immortality),
and you’re glad the plans
to turn the library into
a cryogenic facility are
going well. Death shall
not touch you.
This week, a two-hour
discussion about chore
rotas causes the first of
many rifts between your
housemates. Don’t worry,
only 46 weeks left on the
contract.
This week you are
RON, and you’re finally
enjoying your time in the
limelight. It won’t last.

Government report reveals Britian “still pretty racist”
HANGMAN
The findings provoked
cries of disbelief from
most, who thought
racism had finished
last century.
NegaFelix
Editor-in-Chief
A
new govern-
mental report
was released
last week, which
made the shocking revela-
tion that people in Britain
are still pretty racist.
The “race disparity
audit”, ordered by Theresa
May, began to release
its data last week, which
reveal those from Black
and Minority Ethnic
(BME) backgrounds were
more likely to be stopped
and searched by the police,
and less likely to own
homes or be employed.
The news was a shock
for many across the
country, who thought
that racism ended the day
London elected Sadiq
Khan as Mayor. Becky,
a second year Materials
student from Shropshire,
told Felix: “I was just so
surprised. I thought that
we had left racism behind
in the 19th Century, when
we abolished slavery, but
I guess it’s still an issue. I
don’t know what I can do
about it though, like, I’m
not at all racist – I even
volunteered in Africa last
summer.”
We spoke to Garth
Jerwell, Vice Provost
(Love Imperial, Hate
Racism), who said: “We
strongly disagree with the
conclusions of the report.
Here at Imperial, we have
defeated racism complete-
ly: the only colour we care
about here is the colour of
your money.”
Felix spoke to Chimdi
Achebe, BME Liberation
Officer at Imperial; when
we asked whether he
was surprised that racism
turned out to still be a
problem he said “oh my
God, I am so done with
you people. They don’t
pay me to deal with this
shit.” He abruptly left
the room, and has been
unavailable for comment
since.
