the sights (and sounds) of
the city. We swam at lakes
across the area, played
volleyball, ate our fill of
ice cream, and drank beer
whenever the chance arose
(which was often, by the
way). There were some hi-
larious moments on tour…
but I guess you’ll need to
turn up on Tuesdays at
6pm to find out more!
This was certainly
an unforgettable week
in Wind Band history.
Next stop: November’s
Weekend Away in Oxford!

This summer, Imperial
College Wind Band trav-
elled to Munich, a city
filled to the brim with
culture, beauty, and beer
houses. It was the perfect
destination for the most
sociable musical ensemble
on campus. And boy, did it
go well!
Our first gig was at
the famous Hofbräuhaus,
the largest beer hall in
Munich. It has a rich and
varied history, having
served Mozart, Louis
Armstrong, and John F.
Kennedy. Hopefully we
made the former proud, as
we performed a two-hour
set in the glorious after-
noon sun. Music included
Sedona by Reinke,
Moment from Morricone
and – our favourite – the
theme from The Incred-
ibles. The crowds really
enjoyed the entertainment
and, a Wind Band first,
we were even paid – with
food and steins of beer.
This was truly a night to
remember!
Our second gig was at
Schusterhäusl Biergar-
ten, on the outskirts of
Munich. Our performance
was superb (if we do say
so ourselves) and well
received by the local
audience as we played into
the night. For some of the
band members this was
an emotional experience
as it would be their last
time playing with us as
students. We wish them
all the best for their future
endeavours and hope they
will keep in touch!
During our week away,
we found the time to enjoy
