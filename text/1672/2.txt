Gowns and grandmas – it’s
graduation time
A
round this time
last week, as
we were about
to send off the
paper, the worst happened:
the servers crashed. Ok, so
maybe it’s not as bad as
global poverty, or removal
of the SCR breakfasts, but
it’s still pretty bad. We just
about managed to get the
paper out, but we knew
that this week would be
difficult.
We’ve had to put
together this issue on a
single computer in the
West Basement, and
while I would love to say
I worked myself to the
bone getting this issue out,
that simply isn’t the truth.
Really, the paper is only
in your hands right now
because of the dedication
of a wonderful team of
writers and editors, who
pulled out all the stops
to make sure that things
went smoothly this week.
I can’t thank them enough.
But moving onto some-
thing more exciting: grad-
uation! A time when the
campus is deluged under
a flood of black cloaks,
anxious parents, and lots
of selfies in front of the
library cafe (after all, it’s
probably fed you more
times that your mother has
in the last few years).
I graduated for the
first time from King’s – I
know, I know. It was a
pretty fun day, but I don’t
think any of the pomp and
circumstance compares to
what happened before the
ceremony: it was held at
Barbican, which is located
in central London, next to
a series of water gardens.
Since my graduation was
early, we got there before
the fountains were turned
on, and as a result lots of
people were hopping in
the basins to take photos in
all their finery. The clock
hit 10am, however, and lo
and behold: the sound of
shrieking echoed across
the foyer as graduands
were promptly drenched.
My mum had gone
to the loo at that point,
and she was gutted she
missed out. In fact, she
spent the remainder of
the day talking about how
pointless the whole day
was, since I’d only been
at King’s less than a year,
and “you don’t really
know anyone, do you?”
Thanks ma!
Enough about me. For
the last few years I’ve
always been off-campus
on the day of graduation,
and so I’ve missed the
atmosphere. I’d always
thought – judging from
the pictures – that it would
be crowded, hectic, and
pretty awful, and it is. But
there’s also a celebratory
atmosphere that was
lovely to see. From aunties
in Kente cloth tearing
up as they take photos of
their beloved family, or
confused parents being
shepherded to Beit Quad,
it’s lovely to see everyone
come together and witness
the world’s most expen-
sive handshake.
We even got in on
the action in the West
Basement, taking photos
of graduates with their
families, until this was
promptly shut down by
the College, who claimed
their preferred studio had
a monopoly on photogra-
phy that day. I checked
though, and there were
plenty of you guys posting
fab selfies on the gram, so
they can’t have complete
control. Oh well. There’s
always next year.
Get involved with Felix!
We’re looking for writers, photographers, illustrators, grammar nerds, and
computer whizz-kids
