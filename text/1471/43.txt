The Felix University/College-Wide Invitational Tournament League is
new and improved, with prizes for both the winning team and the win-
ning individual.
Points will be awarded per individual puzzles solved. The first person/
team to send in a correct answer for a puzzle will receive 2 points per
puzzle. After that people who send in correct answers will be awarded
1 point per puzzle. Double points are awarded for cryptic crosswords,
therefore 4 points for the first correct answer and 2 points for others.
Individual and team leagues are separate. The number of puzzles
may change from week to week, which may not be fair points wise but
its only a bit of fun.
Now then FUCWITs, answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Go!
