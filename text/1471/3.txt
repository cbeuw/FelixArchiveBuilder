FELIX Friday 29 October 2010 3
IMS future uncertain
stitute have declined to comment on the
developments, including the Institute’s
Director Professor Darryl Holm, but a
College spokesperson said “the changes
are in line with the Faculty’s aims to en-
sure resources are rationalised.”
Despite the College’s guarantee that
“all of the existing research programmes
and activities of the Institute of Math-
ematical Sciences will continue”, the
only event listed on the institute’s rel-
evant webpage took place in February
2008 and an attempt to discover ‘What’s
On’ leads to an web page error. Their
web page hasn’t been updated since May
2010.
The Institute’s activities were funded
by a grant from the David and Elaine
Potter Charitable Foundation, an organi-
zation that ‘seeks to achieve an impact
through grants that promote reason, edu-
cation, and human rights.’ The College
has said that “The Faculty [of Natural
Sciences] will ensure that [the IMS’]
activities will continue to be built upon
under the new structure.”
There is no information as yet about
what 53 Prince’s Gardens will be used
for but it seems that the Institute of
Mathematical Sciences (after the Life
Sciences restructure) is the latest victim
of the Faculty of Natural Science’s de-
sire to ensure that its “research activities
are sustainably structured.”

Miners in
mascotry mischief
C
ity and Guilds Col-
lege Union (CGCU)
suffered a spanner
in the works after a
night out at the Arch-
angel club, in which a covert oper-
ation was planned to then whisk
the beloved mascot, ‘Spanner’,
into a high-security compound.
However, their plans were foiled
by a student of the Royal School
of Mines (RSM) who knicked it
from under their noses. Now the
waiting game begins as the CGCU
nervously expect the ransom. A
ransom note has been sent to
CGCU demanding the following;
Firstly that a sum of £200 is paid
to RAG, that CGCU ‘sort themselves
out as a committee and get function-
ing like a proper union’ and a barrel
of Becks behind the RSM bar.
Mercifully, ‘Bolt’, the faithful com-
panion of ‘Spanner’ was left so as
to not completely crush the CGCU’s
morale. RAG Chair Naida Dzigal stat-
ed ‘It is refreshing to see that Im-
perial students engage in activities
outside of their courses and even
more to see them doing these with
a sense of Imperial spirit’. Will RAG
receive their ransom? Will CGCU
ever see their treasured mascot
again? All will be revealed on No-
vember 1st.

Embarrassment for
Union as tiles fall off
FiveSixEight bar
For a moment there, it looked like ev-
erything was coming together. FiveSix-
Eight, despite problems and delays,
opened to a lively first night. Everyone
- even the engineers - seemed to be hav-
ing a good time.
However disaster struck as a small
avalanche of tiles fell off the front of
the bar, providing a lively addition to
the opening week’s “mayhem”. The
beer cooling system behind the bar had
caused the wood to bow, thus dislodg-

Ah, I think we’ve got a lead on the culprits. They’re male, white and oh yes, I’d spot those eyebrows any day!
ing the tiles. The Union have said that
they are looking to install insulation to
prevent this happening again.
In addition a chair (which costs around
£120 each) has been broken. The Union
said “they are very strong chairs and
general wear and tear is to be expected
but in this case they appear to have been
broken through severe misuse.” The Un-
ion warned that security is in place every
night to “ensure that the space is used
properly and respected.” Heavy drinkers
will be encouraged to use Metric when
it opens.
