Pioneering
a new
era of
interactive
teaching
at Imperial
P
rofessor Richard Thomas,
from the Department of
Mathematics, has taken on a
new technology to encourage
student interactivity in his
lectures. He is the first lecturer at Impe-
rial to encourage iPhones, Androids and
other smart phones in his lecture. Lizzie
Crouch attends her first maths class in
over 6 years to find out more!
I have to admit that I did feel slightly ner-
vous as I sat down in the back of the Clore
Lecture Theatre. I had a slight hope that
something would become familiar to me
and that I wouldn’t feel like a fish-out-of-
water Humanities student in a Mathematics
lecture... no such luck!
However, I wasn’t here to learn any maths
(phew!) Instead, I am here to see how Pro-
fessor Robert Thomas encourages student
to use their web connected phones to inter-
act during class. My immediate thought is
that it is dangerous territory to encourage
students to bring phones into class but, al-
though it is early days and despite having
Engineers’

The Royal School of Mines have
stolen ‘Spanners’ one of two
official Engineering mascots in
a daring evening raid.

Institute of Math Sciences ‘restructured’
T
he Institute for Mathemati-
cal Sciences (IMS) has
been restructured, and will
be moved out of its home at
53 Prince’s Gardens into a
uncertain future as the Faculty of Natu-
ral Sciences ‘rationalizes’ its resources.
The previous model has been deemed
unsustainable and a new model is being
investigated by the Faculty.
The IMS was launched in 2004 by
then Rector Sir Richard Sykes. At the
time, he commented: “The creation of
an Institute for Mathematical Sciences
Institute forced
out of 53 Prince’s
Gardens after review

at Imperial, which brings together lead-
ing mathematicians from different re-
search sectors, will provide the essential
mathematical underpinning for much of
our future innovation.”
