On Thursday October 18th, Imperial Surf Soc
headed down to Newquay for our first ever
competition. Friday marked the beginning
of the BUCS annual surfing championships
– the biggest surfing competition in Europe –
and we had four surfers ready to do it justice.
The long minibus journey was soon forgotten
as we jumped in the sea to catch some waves
and get some practice in before the first heats
the following day. After showers and sup-
per, drinking ensued, but the four entering the
competition (Will Hunt, Elliot Taylor, Adam
‘Hardcore’ Harvey and Dario Mazza) packed
in early to get some sleep before the big day.
The rest of us (supporters and reserves) decid-
ed the night was still young and headed to the
campsite bar. A few pints later, the Sambuca
shots were on. Unfortunately, Serkan ‘Dun-
can’ Karaagac couldn’t handle this and opted
for a safe vodka and coke, prompting Thom to
empty all the shots into his glass. Serkan was
obliged to Down It, and imminently became
the first casualty of the weekend. Luckily he
wasn’t wearing his ‘pulling shirt’.
The next day, the competition started at 9am
and we only just made it in time. Our surf-
ers were in the first heats, and we’d been mis-
informed about the start time! We arrived at
Fistral Beach to final calls for Elliot, so some
super-quick wetsuit changes were required.
Fortunately, our surfers held their nerve and
pulled off some very respectable surfing. They
had 15 minutes to impress the judges; each
wave they caught was marked out of 10, and
their two best wave scores were added together
to give a final mark out of 20. The two best
surfers in each heat went through to the next
round. Unfortunately, none of our team got
through, despite their best efforts. Frustrating-
ly, Will and Elliot were both third in their heats,
so came very close. The competition was fierce
(it is a national contest) and they didn’t get a
warm-up, so for a first attempt we were not
disappointed with the result. With the pressure
off, we retired to the other end of the beach and
had an enjoyable afternoon’s surfing, followed
by complementary massages provided by the
competition organisers.
The upside of not getting through to the next
round was that no one had to worry about get-
ting a good night’s sleep that evening, so we
could all enjoy the nightlife in Newquay. Our
stomachs lined with spagbol and Doritos, we
began a customary game of Ring of Fire. After
round 2, we stumbled to the camp entrance to
catch the last student-packed shuttle bus into
Newquay town. The official party was in Sail-
ors Club with Nero headlining, so we followed
the crowd there. Needless to say, the rest of
the evening was a glorious haze of dubstep and
drinking.
The effects of the previous night did not ham-
per Saturday’s surfing potential, with a morn-
ing trip to a beach we call ‘Thom’s Secret Spot’
and an afternoon surf at Watergate beach, all
accompanied by perfect sunshine. The evening
led to some unequal and controversial pizza
cutting, and more alcohol consumption, with
some vicious variations on the game Spoons
and obligatory fines, including one for Serkan’s
pick-up line ‘it’s illegal to have an ass like that’
the previous evening. The night took us to the
club at the campsite, and on our return, culmi-
nated in setting the fire alarm off cooking gar-
lic bread, decorating an unconscious Adam and
Serkan with socks, and discovering someone’s
regurgitated supper in the sink.
The next morning, Dario owned up to the
mess in the sink, and we missed our checkout
time by two hours. Slightly jaded, we packed
up and made for Fistral beach to watch the fi-
nals of the competition. The waves were tiny,
but the finalists still managed to pull off some
inspiring moves. After the presentation, we
stopped off at a pub for a much-needed Sunday
roast before returning to London. All in all, it
was an amazing few days, and we’ll definitely
be back next year to build on this year’s result.
