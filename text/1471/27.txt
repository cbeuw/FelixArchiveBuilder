To call this seven piece orchestral pop
troupe’s debut album a “freakshow”
would be like having a middle class ac-
countant as the headline act at Cirque du
Soleil. While some more exciting mo-
ments do shine through the monotony
(often at the very beginning or end of
tracks), the drab remainder is choked by
a thick layer of overproduction and au-
totune. The result is a sickly, saccharine
and over anthemic mush reminiscent
of Alphabeat, with synthetic sounding
orchestral backing. Perhaps when un-
leashed from their oppressive produc-
tion this band could perform well live,
but they remain a disappointment on
record.

A Genuine Freakshow
We asked the presenter of Peer Pressure to visually express what his
show was all about...

onday marks this
year’s launch of ICra-
dio, the official sound
of Imperial College.
The station broad-
casts live at www.icradio.com and has
shows put on by students like you en-
compassing a diverse range of genres.
Here is a brief guide of what to listen
to when you need a welcome distraction
from your mountain of work:
An almost award-winning mixture of
music and banter - The Roushan Alam
Show features celebrity interviews and
live sessions. Edgy and at times on the
dark side of humour recent highlights of
this fast paced show include a campaign
to get Dave Benson Phillips to play a gig
in the union, a live session from Ou Est
Le Swimming Pool and an exclusive in-
terview with Derren Brown.
Come fuel your addiction to 90’s
crazes and indie/alternative music, as
FLUX take you through an hour and a
half of unabashed nerdiness, music and
idle chatter. Siphoning off the best brand
new electronic dance music and packing
it into one seamless hour, every week
Peer Pressure brings you the latest
news and releases from disco to techno.

Invented possesses all the qualities of
a classic Jimmy Eat World album.
It rides along on their signature emo/
American indie rock sound, their soft
tear jerking tunes and their head bang-
ing, highly climatic songs. Invented,
ironically and depressingly, is noth-
ing ground breaking – they continue to
show a lack of versatility as in previous
albums. On My Best Theory (the first
single off the album) and Higher Devo-
tion have strong riffs and sound aggres-
sive but the less weighty songs such as
Cut and Mixtape are easy listens. Ul-
timately Invented is nothing new from
Jimmy Eat World, but nonetheless it’s
an enjoyable listen.

However tempting, comparisons to The
Strokes are unfair. In both lyrical and
musical subtlety, Darwin soars above
them. Throughout, the chord progres-
sions are fantastically odd, reflecting
and enhancing the ironic, faux-philo-
sophical content, “If freckles don’t mean
anything, does anything mean any-
thing?” Blatant hipster sarcasm is turned
into something quite moving thanks to
the simplistic, bouncy rhythm, and Dar-
win’s overly geeky voice. However I
get the impression that the entire song
is based on the fact that “constellation”
and “consolation” sound similar; re-
gardless, this is a rare example of a song
that is both complex and danceable.

Chase and Status have a lot to live
up to following their multiple Drum
and Bass hits and ‘Hypest Hype’ un-
fortunately fails to maintain the high
standards. The vocals feel out of place
and overpower the great sounds from
the synth. The build up is repetitive and
boring, however when the song comes
in with a great mix between heavy gui-
tar (giving the song a Prodigy-like feel)
and genius drum beats, as anticipated,
this song develops into something that
is great to dance to. Despite not living
up to expectations this song will prob-
ably be played over and over in a certain
kind of London club during the next few
months.

The official sound of Imperial unleashed once more online
In contrast Safe as Milk provides non-
sense quips and alternative bullshit un-
officially endorsed by Danny Dyer. The
Al & Rich Show will always entertain
with some unpredictable chaos, while
you can always count on the Fez ‘Not
the hat’ Show for mum jokes, good
music and whole lot of banter. Break
Yourself is simply filthier than Jeremy
Kyle’s guest chairs.
Got a problem? Listen to The Writing
on the Wall; hot chat, hot tunes, and hot
girls and it even has its own agony aunt
feature. Giving you the most important
and entertaining features wrapped up in
a radiogram-shaped bundle is Paper-
cuts, or if you’re looking for a whirl-
wind tour of the world of Rock, Metal
and Punk then look no further than The
Breakdown. If you want your pop/rock/
hip hop/dubstep hunger filled in one bi-
tesize chunk, then get into Eclectic.
Dynamix will start its themed shows
with a handpicked playlist of cover
songs, and Best Foot Forward is a
weekly dose of Indie, alternative and
electronica. Similarly The Propaganda
Show broadcasts the cream of Rock,
Indie and Acoustic music although if
you’re feeling more like a random walk
though the realm of electro, house and
chillwave then check out Ideasyncrat-
ic. The Big Racket! aims to scramble
your synapses and elate your ear-
drums... bringing you sounds from the
farthest reaches of inner space, acoustic
adventures of the nth kind, a bizarre ba-
zaar of existential musicalia.

★★✩✩✩
You’d think anyone who repeats “REC-
OGNISE ME!” in an overwhelming
manner would have accompanied said
phrase with music to re-iterate; but
White Rabbits seem to have merely
suggested it in the hope someone will
eventually take notice. Maybe that’s
why the song is so relatable - in that we
all have a grand idea everyday that will
obviously revolutionise the world, but
we can’t be bothered to get off our ar-
ses and get it acknowledged. Or, maybe
it’s just relatable in that indie-pop songs
with standard piano, guitars, and drums
that don’t go anywhere and fill with no
thrill have been done countless, soul-
destroying times before.
