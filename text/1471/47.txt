J
ohn Matthew Stafford. That
name is likely is likely to mean
something to only a very select
few. Stafford was the number
one draft pick for the NFL in
2009. That is to say that in 2009 Staf-
ford was seen as the best young football
player in America. NFL rules require
players to be out of high school for to
full 2 years before they are eligible to
compete; the NBA and NHL have no
such requirements and thus players in-
cluding LeBron James are drafted from
high school whilst the number one and
two picks in the NHL draft were Taylor
Hall and Tyler Seguin, both of whom
are 18. American sports are a huge deal
from high school through college and
eventually the professional leagues. The
Alamo and Memorial Stadia are both
high school stadia; they seat 23,000 and
20,000 respectively. The importance
placed on sport suddenly becomes clear.
Due to the eligibility rule associ-
ated with the NFL, aspiring football
players tend to target a college sports
scholarship where they can showcase
their talents by playing for their col-
lege. Top collegiate teams have their
games broadcast on American televi-
sion networks. At first glance a system
which encourages emerging sport talent
to progress through college allowing
them to hone their skills, play in front
of crowds of up to 100,000 as well as
providing them with an education is a
good thing. However, all that glitters is
not gold. Many college football players
playing in the top tier divisions are not
at college for an education, they’re using
college as a stepping stone towards the
NFL. Therefore, top collegiate football
teams are extremely professional in their
structure and how they’re run; many
coaches go back and forth between the
NFL and top college football teams. The
football players are thus under extreme
pressure in order to train, attend analy-
sis of games, attend team meetings, play
matches and then spend time on their
academic studies. In order to be eligible
to play, the members of the squad are
required to maintain good grades, with
many players having private tuition in
order to produce the necessary grades.
Even so, the demands of the colle-
giate football means that many players
choose relatively easy classes in order to
achieve the grades they need and focus
intently on their sporting progress.
Many believe that American colleges
are being transformed and it is coming
at the expense of the players; official
figures suggest that around 70% of foot-
ball team members ftom the top division
graduate from college. However, only
53% of the Varsity team of the Universi-
ty of California, Berkley, an Ivy League
school graduated last year; such a low
number was blamed on the demands
which are put on young athletes.
Indeed, Michael Orland who played in
the NFL and at Notre Dame University
believes that his experience of collegiate
football is much different than that ex-
perienced by youngsters today. Orland
feels he got the best type of education
on offer at Notre Dame as well as play-
ing football at a very high level. Ac-
cording to Orland, the televised games
and analysis on the television program
‘Sports Centre’ provides an opportunity
to over scrutinise the players and that the
demands placed on the players is just
too great with sporting gains coming at
the expensive of academia. But, if you
make it to the NFL, if you are a John
Stafford does it matter? Well of course
not, providing you prolong your career,
avoiding serious injury and continually
playing at the highest level in what is a
very fickle sport. The figure that do that
is very small; 2.4% of college football
players make it to the NFL, of those
some will succumb to serious injury or
will be end up being released from their
team. So what becomes of those who
don’t fulfill their dreams and don’t make
it to the NFL; some graduate although it
would seem with questionable qualifica-
tions others don’t graduate at all. And so
the years of both studying and training it
would appear, come to nothing and the
future doesn’t look so bright.
Many are asking if such a system
makes sense? For the colleges it does; the
University of Texas made a revenue of
$87million in 2008 with many suggest-
ing that college players should be paid.
Others believe athletes becoming profes-
sional, earning large sums of money so
young can be detrimental and college
promotes maturity. Could the structure
of English sports be used to help, where-
by young athletes progress through acad-
emies affiliated with professional clubs
for football, rugby and cricket among
others. Such a system may encourage
only those who are likely to succeed to
persue a career in sport and turn profes-
sional. Such a system has its own pitfalls
and is open to scrutiny. Surely some-
thing needs to be done, afterall there are
only so many high-school coaching jobs
available for those talented athletes who
don’t make the grade for the NFL.
