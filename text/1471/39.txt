Scorpio
You piss all your mates off this
week by insisting on conversing
“liiiikkkeeee....Daaaaaaaavidd
Attennnnnnnborrrough....” They slice
your throat, and feed your tonsils to
some cheap-skate first years desperate
for some protein.

Horoscopes
Aries
On Tuesday, you are a man. You find a
need to desperately pee, running to the
closest bog. You decide to treat yourself
by sitting down to take your wee. In the
process, you see words of wisdom on
the wall “The only difference between
having a shit and anal sex is vectoral.”
Taurus
This week your sub-warden rapes you.
You raise your concerns with the Head
Warden, who bemoans the excessive pa-
perwork you have caused him. He tells
you to grow some balls, and that you’ll
be better for the experience. You jump
off a roof and die in a bloody splatter.
Gemini
This week you are a welfare benefit
lazy git of a cuntish chav. You collect
your weekly government allowance on
Saturday morning, only to splash 40%
of it on Simon Cowell’s teeth by repeat
dialling the X-factor hot line. You then
have a wank while listening to Mary.
Cancer
This week you become an astrologist.
You come to the realisation that
Mystic Meg is full of battery chicken
scented crap, so don’t bother with the
relative positions of celestial bodies.
Instead, you release your hate on the
world. YOU FUCKING BASTARDS.
Leo
This week you walk in on your Libra
flatmate shagging the holy grail that is
your mum...
... you take remedial action.
Virgo
GO FUCK YOURSELVES. YOU
VIRGO PIECES OF SHIT. ARGH!!!!
Just because you were born in
September, doesn’t make you so fucking
special. Actually, you ARE special.
In the special sense. You dyslectic,
dispraxic penis eating whores.
Libra
On Monday, you shag a Leo’s mother.
DAMN FUCKING YES!! You ques-
tion your judgement after said Leo grabs
your balls, wrenches them off with a set
of pliers, and forces them down your
gob... But you are still sure you made
the right decision as you slowly die.
Sagittarius
Did you know you have thirty-two teeth
and can touch all of them with your
tongue?
I bet you are actually trying that out now.
You sad, lonely, deprived fuckface of a
human being.
Capricorn
Fuck this. Your star sign isn’t good
enough.
Yeh... go on... CRY FOR ME!!!
Aquarius
You experience excessive wrist strain
this week. Your doctor advises that you
have been excessively masturbating due
to a lack of decent women at Imperial.
You are told to take a four week reha-
bilitation break at the department for
Enhanced Breasts at Santa Barbara, Ca.
Pisces
This week you solve the England foot-
balling crises by killing Paul the World
Cup octopus. The Queen knights you for
your efforts. In the process, you catch a
glimpse of her vag. Yes, fucking yes, she
has a brazilian. You make a mental note
in your wank bank.
“‘TV was ready for HD, but the
house wasn’t’”
Aunty
McPickle is
here to solve
all of your
problems
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I want to dress up as a gladiator from
300 for Halloween to impress a girl from
halls, but I have virtually zero muscles
and body fat and pale yellow skin. Help!
Leonidas Spasticus
Dear Leonidas Spasticus,
Buy a shitload of lard and inject it into
your body – get it right or you’ll look
like a whonky squinty Popeye. And
OMG you need some history education!
This isn’t Sparta,
Aunty McPickle
DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
Oh Luke Lombardo, what would your mother think? Wait, she’s right here
I’ll ask her. She says you’re a naughty boy and when she gets back from
my house she’s going to ground you forever...
