SCIENCE
Can we live forever? Why do we age?
And if a starfish can regrow its limbs,
why can‚Äôt we? These were the monu-
mental questions addressed by Profes-
sor Nadia Rosenthal in the first of this
year‚Äôs Friends of Imperial lecture series.
At first sight, ‚ÄòThe End of Ageing‚Äô
could seem like a hubristic title for a lec-
ture. But as Professor Rosenthal would
explain in an eye-opening hour, we are
already winning (aided no doubt by her
ground-breaking research) the battle
against aging.
But the curiously modest (lecture
titles aside) professor explained, at the
start of her lecture, that the inspiration
for much of her research stems from her
childhood. Recalling her summers play-
ing in rockpools on an island off Maine,
she said that it was the starfish, with
their incredible regenerative ability,
that inspired her and her life‚Äôs research.
Watching these wonderful creatures,
from summer to summer, caused her to
ask the question ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt mammals
regenerate?‚Äô And while she is yet to an-
swer that question (she says we‚Äôre just
evolutionary losers), her research has
shown that mammals can regenerate, if
only with a bit of genetic engineering.
The elusive goal is a world where hu-
mans could regrow their limbs. A world
where that extraordinary ability isn‚Äôt just
the preserve of the newt and the starfish.
The long and winding road to that goal
begins with a seemingly magic ingredi-
ent: IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor
1). This substance comes into play when
there is tissue damage. It promotes re-
generation and regrowth and tellingly
kids, who are much better at regenera-
tion than adults, have a lot of IGF-1, and
steadily lose it as they age.
Arnold Schwarzenegger: Governor of
California, film star and also, a mouse -
one of Professor Rosenthal‚Äôs genetically
modified mice. It‚Äôs bigger and stronger
than your average mouse. Its muscles
age slower, heal better and faster and
have a highly reduced tendency to atro-
phy. Why? The Schwarzenegger mouse
has been genetically modified to pro-
duce more IGF-1 in its muscles.
Interestingly, as Professor Rosenthal
explains, this miracle-like substance is
linked to white blood cells, specifically
macrophages. These cells which help
form our formidable immune system,
and perversely cause inflammation and
health problems, have a Jekyll-and-Hyde
character. M1, the Mr Hyde in our anal-
ogy, comes into play when we are in-
jured and it bulldozes away any bacteria
to protect us from infection. It then gives
Fighting the never-ending battle against ageing
way to M2, the Jekyll of the macrophage
world, which encourages tissue regen-
eration and crucially secretes IGF-1. The
flourish at the end of this process is that
IGF-1 in turn stimulates more M2.
Ah now, we‚Äôve solved it, IGF-1 is the
answer, the solution to bald hair, wrin-
kled skin and age related degenerative
diseases. An injection of this Elixir of
Life should do the job right? Wrong. It
only works when it has been released at
the site of the injury, immediately after
the injury. It stimulates chemokines,
which act like molecular microphones
and call other cells to help heal an in-
jury. But not just any cells, bone marrow
stem cells. The challenge is to engineer
certain cells to deliver IGF-1 in the right
place, at the right time to stimulate the
process of regeneration.
We haven‚Äôt traversed the entire length
of the road towards regrowing our own
limbs (or more prosaically, repairing
damaged heart tissue) but thanks to Pro-
fessor Rosenthal and her team, we do at
least have a road map.
