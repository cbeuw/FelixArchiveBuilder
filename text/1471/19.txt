COMMENT
O
ur society pours so much
scorn onto cheaters. Af-
ter public outcry, John
Terry was stripped of
the England captaincy
because of his infidelity. Can you im-
agine getting chucked out of university
because of your personal life?
And speculation about whether
Brangelina got together before or after
his split from Jen dominated the press
for what seemed like an age. Does it
matter? Does it affect you?
I’m not saying anger is unjustified, or
that being betrayed doesn’t hurt like hell.
Just that the punishment doesn’t quite fit
the crime. Many of us have done it. And
if you are sitting there thinking you have
never even been tempted…well I’m sor-
ry, I simply don’t believe you. When a
relationship is on the rocks, we reach out
to someone who can give us what our
partner cannot. Making spurious judg-
ments about the lives of others is such
a waste of time, perhaps understanding
might be a bit more productive.
Weirdly, my mother told me that when
she was young, her relationships had a
tendency to overlap. As you can prob-
Black Sheep
ably tell, my upbringing was quite a
liberal one. Her ‘experience’ illuminates
an important point. We all follow ‘pat-
terns’ in our relationships, even people
as lovely as my mum. Many of us will
leave our boyfriend or girlfriend only
when we find another person worth the
effort. It takes a great deal of courage to
end a relationship as soon as you realize
you are unhappy. Is it any wonder that
some of us will cheat before we realise
exactly what we want? For some, infi-
delity is a sign of inner turmoil. Not only
should we avoid judgement, perhaps we
should even be sympathetic to these lost
souls.
I can just hear you now. ‘You wouldn’t
say that if it happened to you’. Yes, fair
enough, I’ve never been unfaithful, nor,
to my knowledge, been cheated on my-
self. But I have felt my eye wandering. I
can understand how angry my boyfriend
would have felt if he found that out, how
hurt, how disrespected. In a sense, my
attitude is actually more judgemental.
I consider wanting to cheat as much of
a betrayal as actually doing it. But I’m
sure if we could see everything our part-
ners were thinking, there would plenty
to get angry about.
Don’t get me wrong, I do have a con-
science, there are some things that are
just plain wrong. Repeatedly lying to
someone, either to maintain an affair or
to have a lot of little ones, deserves our
scorn (step forward Wayne Rooney).
But there are so many good people who
have done this. I fully admit to being ca-
pable of doing it.
I guess it comes down to a sense that
staying with someone you don’t care
about is just as hurtful as cheating on
them. If you feel your relationship get-
ting stale, either work on it, or end it.
In my opinion, if people actually act on
their adulterous impulses, it’s a sign of
weakness, or drunkenness, or both. It
is not necessarily a sign of an immoral
character.
To assume that you would never, ever
cheat given the opportunity is a big
claim. And one I think few people could
honestly make. So why waste time judg-
ing those who do?
I
decided I’d sit down and watch
Channel 4’s latest purchase, “The
Event”, last week. Partly because
the advertising campaign had
caught my eye, but mostly be-
cause it didn’t look anything like Lost.
This turned out to be wrong on a level
so fundamentally obvious it was only
matched by the crushing inevitability of
the show’s own plotline. The Event is a
pile of turgid poo-poo.
Let me summarise for you. A comput-
er games programmer has…NO. WAKE
UP. You see? You were beginning to
drift off already, weren’t you? This is
what this entire genre of television re-
lies on - being so vague you just start
dreaming up the missing sixty percent
of the narrative so the writers don’t have
to bother.
The first episode was a horrific mish-
mash of plotlines which were presum-
ably supposed to be excitingly open-
ended - why is a plane being crashed
into the President’s summer home? Who
are these crow-faced aliens with strange
abilities to distort the laws of physics?
Why is the saucepan-faced actor playing
the protagonist incapable of expressing
emotion through facial expressions?
You’re supposed to ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ at
these, and then immediately mash the
‘Record Series’ button on your remote
Angry Geek
before the first ad break.
Except, as we all know, most of
these shows are written in episode or-
der, with little or no idea how half of
the plot strands should end up. Lost’s
laughable attempt at ‘closure’ in its
final series turned out to be a hasty
patching of plot holes and then a shrug
of the shoulders in the direction of any-
thing they couldn’t explain sufficiently
with a flashback. The Event will be no
different.
Of course, it looks like it might.
There’s some edgy storytelling that
flicks back and forth between timelines,
cunningly re-using the same footage
over and over again to pad out the epi-
sodes. There’s a shady military advisor
hiding a secret project from a sceptical
and honourable president. It’s all pretty
groundbreaking.
But at the end of the day, you won’t be
watching it because of its vacuum-like
absence of acting quality; or because
the dialogue ever makes it beyond sum-
marising everything that is going on
around the actors; you’ll be watching it
because it’s failing to tell you the whole
story, and that has somehow become a
‘technique’.
It’s not a technique. It’s just a lazy way
to avoid doing anything that would re-
quire a full arse of effort. Half of the rea-
son people play videogames nowadays
is that the dialogue and plot structure is
no worse than the nonsense on TV, but
at least there’s the opportunity to jump
on people’s heads while they’re spew-
ing the pointless plot advancement out
at you. And if it gets too mysterious,
you can always just shoot the nearest,
most confusing thing until it explodes.
It’s like being Sherlock Holmes, if the
stories had been written by Quentin
Tarantino.
Anyway, this leaves me at a loss for
what to watch while I spike packs of
Haribo with laxatives in preparation for
this Sunday’s festival of reminding peo-
ple why children are a bad idea, so this
weekend I imagine I will just borrow
the CCTV tapes from a few local shops,
switch between them every ten seconds
or so, and try and work out a plot from
the people coming and going. It’ll be
just as vague and equally enticing. Plus
if I really come onto something, I might
be able to pitch it to Channel 4 in time
for next October’s schedules.
If you’d like to bang on endlessly
about the nuances of modern
television, don’t forget that my
inbox is always open to useless
twaddle - anangrygeek@gmail.com.
Keep watching the skies.
The Event went off with a ‘pfft’
“This genre of
television is so vague
you dream up the
missing narrative
so the writers don’t
have to”
“Can you imagine
getting chucked out
of university because
of your personal
life?”

Corrections and
Apologies
We strive, at Felix, to ensure
that all the content that we
produce is accurate and with-
out grammatical, typographical
or syntactical errors. However
from time to time we do not live
up to our own high standards.
Last week there were a few ma-
jor errors that we would like to
account for.
1. In the story ‘FiveSixEight
opens’ we incorrectly stated
that the bar was three weeks
late. It was actually two weeks
late.
2. In the Science section, we
printed the incorrect headline
on the schizophrenia article.
We apologise to the author
Katie Tomlinson for this.
3. On the front page, the page
number leading to the Fashion
article ‘Welcome to London’
was incorrect.
4. We neglected to print the so-
lution to the Sports’ crossword
and also printed an unsolvable
nonogram. We hope that the
extra puzzles this week will
make up for that oversight.
Our aim is to avoid errors en-
tirely but please email felix@
