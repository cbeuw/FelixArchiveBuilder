How to Play: Slitherlink
You love it, your mates love it, even your
gran loves this mental, mind fuck of a
puzzle. I’ve even seen the lecturers do
them in their spare time. No jokes......
If you’ve ever played minesweeper, then
you should be able to understand this
puzzle. The number in each box repre-
sents the number of lines that can exist
around it. Lines can never cross! In the
end, you will end up with a closed loop.
Just have a look at last week’s solution.

Clegg: That way is south, Ed, so
East side is the best.
Osbourne: I agree with Nick.
This week’s winner is Jonathon
Messing
Wordoku
The Wordoku is back with a vengeance, and a
brace of puzzles are present for your solving
pleasure, though lacking the normally
offensive final phrases. As you might have
guessed by now, they are Halloween themed
instead.
You know the drill: it’s the same as regular
sudoku in that every row, column and 3x3 box
must contain all 9 symbols. The difference is
one of them will spell out a word or phrase.
