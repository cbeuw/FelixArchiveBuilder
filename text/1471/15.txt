It seems that every time I
write on this blog its bad
news. Although today is no
exception, I will start off by
telling you some good things.
Firstly FIveSixEight has opened,
exceeding all expectations. On the first
Wednesday we took over ¬£15,000!
Which is a record number. The week
started off well, with the doors to
FiveSixEight opening at 5PM.
I personally saw people run into the bar,
eager to be the first patron of the colossal
concrete bar. Within seconds the bar
was 5 deep, and a sense of achievement
ensued, when this was reduced within
minutes. FiveSixEight truly is a small
insight to how amazing this final phase of
the build will be.
I am extremely proud of all the staff
at Imperial College Union (including
the student ones) for all the hard work
they have put in over the month. The
conditions have not been ideal, but the
overwhelming response from students is
a testament to their efforts. I personally
hope that with the premise of Metric on
the horizon, we will all take ‚Äúour game‚Äù to
the next level.
The Delay to Metric

A post from Ravi‚Äôs Blog.
Now for the aforementioned unfortunate
news. Asbestos was found Wednesday
last week in the nightclub venue.
Consequently the proposed opening date
of 29 October is now impossible. The risk
of exposure to the workers in that area
means that only certain parts of the space
can be occupied, while the asbestos
material is removed, leading to a delay in
works.
After talks with the contractors, and
various Union staff, the revised launch
period will be the end of November.
While this delay is unfortunate, it must be
understood that this project has thrown
up a huge range of challenges that
could not have been predicted and the
contractors and project team are working
at capacity to achieve completion.
I would like to thank our
students for their patience as
we build a social centre for
students at Imperial and the
students of London.
