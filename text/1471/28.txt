I
have to admit that reggae and
psychedelia is not an orthodox
blend, come to think of it, it’s
hardly like anything out there,
and that’s what makes me admire
the Easy Star All-Stars for doing some-
thing different. Different is not always
good, and for those of you who hold
the likes of Pink Floyd and The Beatles
on a pedestal of progressive and glori-
ous music, I would advise you to steer
clear. However, there is no reason why
one of the greatest conceptual albums in

history, ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’,
cannot be opened up to a new audience
of reggae skankers. I must admit that I
regard some of the original music by
these bands as a force that is powerful
enough to change the world and at times
the Easy Star All-Stars may have missed
the point a little and do commit ruthless
butchering of otherwise perfect music,
but then again, I think, why the hell not?
As they kick off their set with several
arrangements from ‘Easy Star’s Lonely
Hearts Dub Band’, the mood is that of
summertime blazing, cheerful reggae
with energized horn parts chirping up
with stylish syncopation, and to top it all
off they’re playing Beatles songs! The
thoughtful arrangement of these songs
comes from Michael Goldwasser, who
himself plays on the records and has
certainly ‘stirred it up’.
Continuing their jiving set they move
on to play songs from ‘The Dub Side of
the Moon’, with in my opinion a little
too much sunlight creeping into the likes
of ‘Money’, but they deliver it without

apology. They’re not afraid to take the
risk and that shows in their performance.
There was a small appearance from
their new album ‘Dubber Side of the
Moon’, but they kept the good vibes
with tasters from ‘Radiodread’ and a su-
perb encore of ‘Redemption Song’.
There is an essential ingredient to
this gig I have left out, not because it’s
easily forgotten but because these peo-
ple work out of sight, and out of sight
is out of mind, but I want to add extra
credit to these magic makers and praise
the sound guys, from the alien space-
ship that is the sound-desk. These were
some real geniuses of blending the reg-
gae staccato with the psychedelic wavy
echoing. As we all know, Beatles music
or that of Pink Floyd requires massive
attention to the sound waves and effects
that create each respective bands sound.
These guys delivered and to them I say
thank-you. A dub filled evening that re-
ally shows the Easy Star All-Stars as the
fearless force they are.
