Crossword
CHESS MAZE Colours mate in 3 moves
Welcome. I’m afraid you’re not safe even in the quick crossword this week,
as it has been taken over by a terrible horror (17 Across). You must defeat this
famous horror through the power of clue solving. Once the clues have been
solved and the horror has been revealed, you must change one letter in three
of your answers, which will simultaneously reveal three things known to
combat this beast and leave the horror in a messy, unrecognisable state.
Across
1. Lacking understanding (7,3,5)
9. Remaining after deductions (3)
10. Bringer of desires in folklore
(7,4)
11. Highly susceptible (8)
13. Sensible (9)
16. Indicate; frequency plot (4)
17. HORROR OF THE NIGHT (7)
19. American plum (4)
20. Commit forever (7)
23. Voluntary contribution to
religious organisation (5)
24. Chaos (5)
25. Reverberate (4)
27. Regrets (7)
31. Plant extract used in lotions,
creams etc. (6,3)
32. Instantly (2,3,4,2,1,3)
It is my regret that, due to a reshuffle, the cryptic crossword is now in a
completely separate section, thus ruining my chances of a “CRYPT-ic”
Halloween pun. Apologies for any convenience caused due to lack of said
pun.
Down
1. Intelligence society (5)
2. Marry (6,4)
3. Direction of the centre (6)
4. Rumor-based banter (6)
5. Acclaim; precipitate (4)
6. Organised persecution of ethnic
group (6)
7. Object (4)
8. Visual aid for long distances (9)
12. Reptiles (inf.) (5)
14. Relating to France (6)
15. Furniture covering (10)
16. European city (9)
18. Correct (5)
19. Personal pronoun (3)
21. Visualise (3)
22. Motorsport organisation (6)
23. 50/50 (4,2)
26. Young bird (5)

After receiving a barrage of angry e-mails concerning last week’s unsolvable
nonogram, Felix apologises for the error, and all who did complain get a shiny
reward in the form of FUCWIT points. There, isn’t everyone happy?

Huh? Is this the standard of our
newspaper nowadays? A space-filling
muddle of orange blobs and green jelly
babies?
An inferior person would leave it at that
and go eat some spray-on cheese, but
Imperial students know otherwise. For
what initially appears to be a random
jumble of symbols is actually a coded
message.
What is the code? That’s up to you to
figure out. Look at the frequency of the
symbols present to try and determine
what code is being used. When
implemented, the correct code gives a
thematic message.
