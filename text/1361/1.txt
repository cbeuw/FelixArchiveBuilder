Referendum
to decide on
joining NUS
The referendum to decide whether
Imperial College Union will affiliate
to the NUS has been decided upon
at Exec and Council, with the Yes
and No campaign leaders being
appointed and budgets assigned to
each campaign.
The referendum was triggered by
a petition handed to the Union Pres-
ident, John Collins, with 704 signa-
tories. After checking the CIDs and
names of those who signed, only

617 of the 704 were deemed to be
valid, just 3 more than the 614 re-
quired by the Union Constitution
(5% of the Union’s total member-
ship of 12,267). The Exec paper rec-
ommended that the question on the
ballot be: “Should Imperial College
Union affiliate to the National Un-
ion of Students (NUS)?”
Mr Collins’ paper to Council re-
veals that almost all the Executive
Committee declared an interest in
the NUS, and therefore could not
form the Referendum Committee.
The only members without an inter-
est were James Millen (SCC Chair),
James Yearsley (Media Group
Chair), Shama Rahman (Deputy
President, Graduate Students) and
Jon Matthews (Deputy President,
Finance & Services). Mr Matthews
has been approved by Monday’s
Council meeting to act as Return-
ing Officer for the referendum, as
John Collins (Union President) de-
clared an interest and stood down.
Some hacks are unhappy with
the sabbs being so vocal with their
opinions on the NUS, and arguing
that ICU is already being influ-
enced by the ideas of the NUS. Fe-
lix approached each of the sabbs to
ask what their interest in the NUS
was. Ben Harris (Deputy Presi-
dent, Education & Welfare), said:
“Everybody knows I’m pro-NUS,”
adding that he felt it was okay for
him to campaign on behalf on the
pro-NUS cause: “If I believe some-
thing is right for students, then I’ll
campaign for it.” There are also un-
confirmed rumours that Mr Harris
was spotted ‘lewd dancing’ with the
NUS President, Gemma Tumelty,
after the Presidents’ Dinner during
the handover period, though thank-
fully no photos survive of this event.
Mr Collins (Union President) has
gone on record numerous times
as being pro-NUS, and comment-
ed to this reporter on his reasons
for declaring an interest: “I want
to be part of the debate.” It is not
yet clear whether Mr Collins will
campaign directly for the pro-NUS
cause. Eric Lai (Deputy President,
Clubs & Societies) is well known as
a supporter of the anti-NUS cam-
paign, and is likely to command the
backing of the sports clubs, thanks
to his role as ACC Chair last year.
The leader of the Yes campaign
is Alex Guite, a friend of Mr Harris,
and the leader of the No campaign
is James Fok, the CGCU President,
a position once held by Mr Collins.
Each of the parties has been given
£1000 to campaign with, and equal
access to student media and other
communication opportunities.
The student media are working
together to ensure the facts are
presented to students in an unbi-
ased way. To this end, Felix is col-
laborating with the CGCU online
newspaper, Live! (live.cgcu.net),
to present arguments from the
Yes and No campaigns. Live! will
provide discussion forums based
around opinion pieces they receive
from each of the campaigns. The
Union’s TV station, stoic TV, will be
running a documentary about the
NUS, interviewing the sabbs and
NUS officials.
Felix urges students to think care-
fully about the ramifications that
affiliation may have upon the Union
before voting, and that such a deci-
sion should not be made lightly.
Felix editor-in-chief, Andrew Neil Sykes, pictured practising his
gurning skills for the upcoming Visage Contortion Festival 2007,
stunned family and friends when he graduated on Wednesday.
Passing with a 2:1 grade and being awarded the Evans’ Medal for
outstanding Chemistry skills, rumours that he slept his way to
success are completely unfounded. Upon finishing his sabbatical
position, a PhD and permanent life of periodic tables and PVC
aprons await. Congratulations from the Felix team! Much love.
