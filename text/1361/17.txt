Wildlife Photographer of the Year
Reading some of the captions in
this year’s Wildlife Photographer of
the Year competition in the Natural
History museum, you’d be forgiven
for wondering why anyone wants to
take photos of wildlife at all. Living
in the constant buzz that is London,
it is hard to imagine what motivates
someone to sit in a hide for days on
end, waiting for that perfect picture.
Yet each year photographers thank-
Beauty and tragedy, drama and serenity: London’s most exciting photography exhibition returns for 2006
of the competition being sponsored
by Shell, a leader in an industry
that clearly has a much greater ef-
fect on the environment than can
be expressed by a few photos.
The Wildlife Photographer of the
Year exhibition takes place at the
Natural History Museum in
South Kensington. Tickets cost
£6 or £3.50 for students.
tive, the pictures will astonish and
amaze you, and sometimes you’ll
wonder how on Earth they could be
real.
Walking around the (deceptively
time-consuming) room, you’ll move
across continents and through
seasons and be absorbed in the
extremes of landscapes, yet you’ll
also be touched by the subtleties of
nature.
Iwouldlistmyfavourites,butthere
would be far too many; besides, you
should decide for yourself.
One pleasing touch to the exhibi-
tion is a slide show of the best pho-
tographs from competitions past,
the inclusion of which challenges
this year’s contributors to be ever
more inventive.
One of the categories of the
competition, called “The World in
Our Hands”, asks for photographs
which “convey our relationship
with the environment”.
When looking at these photos I
couldn’t help but feel the hypocrisy
fully do just that, and the fruits of
their labour are now on show at the
Natural History Museum. Make no
mistake, this is the best photogra-
phy exhibition in London, so if you
go to one gallery this year, make
it this one. (Besides, it’s just down
the road, so you can easily fit it in a
spare hour.)
Varying from humorous to mov-
ing, clichéd to completely innova-
