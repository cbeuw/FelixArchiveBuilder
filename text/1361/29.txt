come world champions once again.
Schumacher quickly got to work by
putting together a team of highly
skilled and motivated engineers
and mechanics.
Despite driving a vastly inferior,
dog of a car, Schumacher took Fer-
rari to 3 wins that season. Most
notable was his first emotional vic-
tory for Ferrari at the Spanish GP
in Barcelona. There he obliterated
the field on a wet track to win by an
astounding 45 seconds, despite hav-
ing dropped to 6th place at the start
of the race. Forty-five seconds in a
sport where timed measurements
are calculated to infinitely small
denominations of a thousandth of
a second is practically a lifetime in
a F1 race.
The next year, in 1997, Schu-
macher had a season to forget. Af-
ter being found guilty of attempt-
ing to drive Jacques Villeneuve off
the track in a bid to win the world
championship, he was stripped of
all his championship points for that
season. This is considered by many
as a turning point in the sport’s
perception of Schumacher. He still
had his defenders, but now he had
garnered a whole new set of critics
prepped with stoked branders.
McLaren-Mercedes rose to
dominance in the late 1990s and
took both the double in 1998 and
the driver’s championship in 1999,
with Mika Hakkinen at the wheel.
Despite breaking his legs at Sil-
verstone and missing 7 races in all,
Schumacher finished the year 3rd
in the championship.
The new millennium brought with
it a new era of complete and utter
dominance by Michael Schumacher
and Ferrari. Together, they snapped
up both the drivers and construc-
tors championships for 5 years on
the trot – the most dominant era
by any single driver and any single
team ever seen in the history of
the sport. Prior record holder Juan
Manuel Fangio had won 5 career
world championships in the dura-
tion of his career, whereas Schu-
macher not only blasted through
that 50 year standing record in 2002,
but set a new one by winning just as
many championship consecutively
in only one team. That same year,
he faced controversy for the most
public display of team orders ever
seen in F1. At the Austrian GP
, his
teammate Rubens Barrichello was
in the lead and about to win the race
when he was radioed to slow down
in the last corner and let Schu-
macher take the win. The outcry
in the sport was massive, however
Ferrari got away with a $1m fine.
His dominance was so oppressive
that in 2002 and 2004 the sport was
labelled boring and news compa-
nies stopped sending journalists to
the races to cover events where in
all probability Schumacher would
win.
He relinquished his crown to
young pretender Fernando Alonso
in 2005 and despite a hard fought
2006 championship campaign, was
unable to regain his title. A blown
engine at the penultimate race ef-
fectively sealed the championship
for Alonso and Renault.
Schumacher is labelled by many
as a “cheat”, but I like to believe
he is a genius, albeit inherently
flawed. Critics emphasize how he
tried to drive his competitors off
the track. With this dire hunger he
even rammed his brother, Ralf, into
the wall at 190mph. But these crit-
ics take too much ease in overlook-
ing the unsporting actions of other
greats such as Ayrton Senna who
drove Alain Prost off the track in
1990 to win the world championship.
Others fault him for being handed
number one status in Ferrari, and
that all his teammates were bound
by contracts to do one thing: Help
Schumacher win. The fact of the
matter is Ferrari is Schumacher’s
team. Had it not been for him, they
would probably have continued
their performance spiral to the
back of the grid, and perhaps com-
pletely out of the sport all together.
As a rule of thumb, the best driver
gets the number one treatment in
a team, all down the pitlane. The
same can be said of pilots. Same
difference.
Looking back at Formula One his-
tory, it is easy to see examples of
people who have pushed the limits
of the rules to the maximum to win,
Schumacher is no different. His
finely tuned dogmatic drive to do
only one thing has labeled him as
aggressive. His only objective is to
race a car to victory and he will do
anything it takes, even if he over-
steps the limits of sportsmanship.
As Formula One moves into a new
era without Michael Schumacher,
manyhaveaskedthequestion,“who
will replace Michael Schumacher”?
Although the sport is seeing a huge
wave of talent filtering through as in
Fernando Alonso, Kimi Raikkonen
and Felipe Massa, the answer to
that question can only be “there will
never be a replacement for Michael
Schumacher”. There is little doubt
that any one of these drivers can
break one or two of Schumacher’s
records, however, it is currently in-
conceivable that any of them will go
on to beat a man who has rewritten
the record books. No other driver
besides Schumacher can polarise
this sport in such a fashion, or ce-
ment a team so cohesively together
beneath them, or drive the boots
off their car so well even when the
odds are heavily stacked against
them. In the end, Senna was the
fastest ever race driver, over a lap
his ability was simply mind bend-
ing, but as the complete package,
there is no parallel to Schumacher.
He has raised the benchmark in
Formula 1, and has shown that it is
no longer enough to be just the fast-
est race driver, one must have the
complete package; speed, team-
work, resilience, technical aptitude
and courage. Despite his cold cal-
culating “winning machine” image
in the sport, he is known for being
a charitable person, giving $10m to
the Asian Tsunami Fund, the larg-
est single contribution made. He
works as an ambassador for many
charities and promotes the road
safety message of the FIA.
There are many that say his last
ever Grand Prix and indeed his last
ever championship didn’t amount to
much. Regardless, he left the sport
in the most fitting way that only
Michael Schumacher could. With
a championship deficit of 25 points
in Canada, many had ruled him out,
yet at Monza where he announced
his retirement, he was back level
on points with Fernanado Alonso.
In the season closing race, having
had his left rear tyre punctured, an
unscheduled pit stop sent him to
20th position. He cut a 70 second
time deficit to under 30 seconds
and carved up the field to 4th place.
Chasing Jenson Button for a po-
dium place into the final lap of his
career at Sao Paulo, he was over
5 seconds behind, yet he simply
refused to lift his right foot off the
throttle pedal, setting the fastest
lap of the race. For 15 years, there
hasn’t been a single race where a
Michael Schumacher win has been
discounted, he has been an omni-
present force. In the end, he went
out as a true champion and, more
importantly, as a true racer.
Top, Schumacher gleeful over a glorious win that probably earned him a few quid. Center, Formula 1
stockcar with really expensive tires and choice endorsements. Bottom, “Cheerio and toodle pips!?”
