50th London Film Festival
Felix provides the low down on everything cinematic that the BFI has on offer for you
As the fourth week of term grinds to
an end, many will be getting bored.
The freshers’ events are mostly
over and the dull, aching rhythm
of our respective courses has prob-
ably just begun to noticeably eat
away at the abstract noun that we
Imperial students no longer refer to
as a “life”. Never fear: there’s some-
thing far more interesting to do.
For two weeks, London is the cen-
tre of the Cinema world. The Times
BFI 50th London Film Festival will,
by the time you read this, have
swallowed Leicester Square, and a
cavalcade of actors, directors, and
beautiful people will be waltzing up
and down its long, red tongues.
What’s this I hear you cry?
“World-renowned film festivals are
for places like Venice and Cannes,
not the likes of us!”
How very wrong you are. Even
though most of you have never
heard of it, the London Film Fes-
tival is a prestigious event on the
international film calendar, and
this is the 50th anniversary of its
inaugural opening with Akira Kuro-
sawa’s Throne of Blood. Thus, with
its line up of screening events and
world premiers, it is guaranteed to
be brain-smashingly good.
If you are still unconvinced, the
festival sweetens the deal with its
array of amazing guests and speak-
ers, including Dustin Hoffman, Tim
Burton, Bob Hoskins, Jude Law,
Will Ferrel, Martin Sheen, Gillian
Anderson, Richard Linklater, Ben
Affleck and Yo La Tengo.
In fact, the main problem with the
festival is deciding what to see. Un-
fortunately, as with all things in this
great city, it isn’t cheap (from £7 to
£11 for most of the screenings); so
whittling down the number of films
to an affordable number (from the
180+ available) is painful. If you
aren’t an all-knowing film buff with
a couple already picked out, the
best way to do this is to stick to
the Galas, special screenings and
screen talks.
At £15 they are more expensive
than the normal screenings, but
they are truly red-carpet events; at-
tended by members of the cast and
crew who give talks and Q&A ses-
sions once the film has finished. It
is a rare experience to see people
standing in front of you who were
on the screen mere moments ago;
and to ask them, and the other cre-
ative forces, the questions that in-
evitably pop into your head during
a film. Among most promising of
these will be Babel, an epic drama
starring Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett
and Gael Garcia Bernal, created
by the writer and director team re-
sponsible for Amores Perros and
21 Grams; and Stranger Than Fic-
tion, an intelligent comedy starring
Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman and
Maggie Gyllenhaal.
With the festival on our doorstep
such gems cannot be ignored, no
matter how little time you claim to
actually have. Will Ferrell in Stranger Than Fiction at the London Film Festival

FilmSoc’s revolutionary take on the LFF
On Monday 23rd October, a jovial
group of seventeen members from
FilmSoc marched our way to the
annual BFI London Film Festival
for our first trip of the year.
The festival is now in its 50th year
and has many different strands, in-
cluding World Cinema, New British
Cinema, Experimenta and Treas-
ures from the Archives, as well as
the obligatory special guests, red
carpet events and discussions from
directors, actors and other mem-
bers of the film crews.
However, we were there to see
The Signs and Petites Révélations,
which were showing at the Cine Lu-
mière as part of the French Revolu-
tions strand of the festival. As well
as the two films, there was also a
Q&A session with both directors.
The Signs is directed by Eugène
Green, who has been described as
“one of the best-kept secrets of cur-
rent French cinema”. This short
film came about when he was asked
to make a film inspired by a piece of
contemporary art. He chose a trip-
tych of photographs by the Basque
artist Maitetxu Etchevarria, and
used them as inspiration for this
story about a family’s vigil for the
father who has been missing for 10
years, presumed lost at sea. As Eu-
gene discussed afterwards though,
the main focus of the film is really
to communicate some of his ideas
about the universe, and how he be-
lieves that the universe has mean-
ing, which we can discover if we are
wise enough to recognise the signs
presented to us.
Petites Révélations, directed by
Marie Vermillard, consists of a se-
ries of moments in the lives of vari-
ous unconnected people, some very
emotionally charged, others less
so. Marie explained that she had
been writing down these moments
in her notebook for many years,
and she made this unconventional
film without a narrative to allow
us to focus on the moods created
by these various moments. Petites
Revelations was generally agreed
to be the favourite, the concept is
one of those things which can only
really be communicated effectively
through the medium of film, it’s
pretty much impossible to explain
in writing!
Anyway, if this article has man-
aged to whet your movie appetite
or tickle your cinematic tastebuds,
the festival is ongoing until the 2nd
November. I urge you to get along
and see one of the films showing.
