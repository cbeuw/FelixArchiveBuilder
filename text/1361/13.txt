live review
This week’s diet of guitars
The Kooks impress live despite critical backlash and golden oldies underachieve
It seemed almost ironic that during
the closing moments of their pivotal
and evidently most popular track,
Naïve, the words ‘Just don’t let me
down’ rang out as everyone in the
ecstatic crowd outstretched their
hands to the ceiling. Not one person
showed the slightest sign of disap-
pointment throughout the gig.
I was given no time to adapt to
the level of uncontrollable hyste-
ria the crowd suddenly achieved
as The Kooks ventured out onto
the stage. Before any instruments
were picked up I was already suit-
able crushed by squealing girls
and blaring men, with beer already
dripping slowly down my neck. Sea-
side was the perfect opener, it built
up the indie-flavoured atmosphere
with a fantastic acoustic sound-
scape, bringing a smile to even the
most sardined person.
Eddie’s Gun burst into life and the
thunderous cheering by the crowd,
Oldies fail to nourish ears these days
I’malwaysabitdubiouswhenbands
put the word ‘scene’ in their song
or album titles, it usually means
that they’re desperately scenester
whilst desperately trying to deny
it (hello The Cribs). Also, everyone
knows that Radio 4 are a poor man’s
LCD Soundsystem. Luckily for Ra-
dio 4 something about that fat white
single I possess by the band follows
that formula.
To be honest if you’re really lazy,
Radio 4 aren’t the worst place to
look for that indie-rock-dance cross-
over, but there are a hundred simi-
lar, better bands out there and they
don’t have a cowbell. Listen to The
Rapture instead, they’re better.
James Millen
random projectiles and unintended
violence dealt out by the various,
numerous inebriated fans present
would have looked like a full-scale
riot from afar. This is something
you would not normally associate
with The Kooks, undeniably, it was
all the better for it.
After only five songs I smelt
strongly of beer and, interestingly,
cannabis smoke – no wonder the
people behind me announced that
they could actually see the music.
You could certainly feel the emo-
tion of the band, though; the music
flowed down into the crowd as they
towered over us all on the stage,
whilst everyone present was mar-
vellously illuminated by some spec-
tacular lighting effects.
She Moves In Her Own Way
made its appearance about halfway
through, and those in the standing
area were doing anything but. Their
hands were swinging erratically,
beer was sprayed liberally all over
the place, and several people disap-
peared into the pulsating crowd.
The encore began after the crowd
decided to impersonate a stamped-
ing herd of wild rhinoceroses, and
amazingly people quietened down
to listen to some new solo work by
Luke. He wowed even the most ex-
citable, drunken fan by once again
demonstrating his skills on an
acoustic.
The closer, Pull Me In, proved to
be the highlight, with both the band
and the crowd’s infectious enthusi-
asm soaring, which climaxed with
Luke crowd-surfing. He was lucky
not to have been sucked down into
the pit of screeching girls already
gripping his trousers legs.
A special mention must go to their
as yet unreleased songs – scattered
liberally throughout their playlist –
all of which proved as popular with
the crowd as their debut album
material.
After the gig, as I was plodding
through the sea of plastic cups and
various liquids on my way out, I
couldn’t help thinking about what
the frontman of Razorlight, Johnny
Borrell, once said about The Kooks,
branding their music 'shit' and the
lead singer 'boring'. The Kooks
soon retorted, dedicating the single
Naïve to Borrell.
After experiencing such a memo-
rable performance, I can whole-
heartedly say that anyone who
claims they produce sub-standard
music is truly Naïve.

Hundred Reasons are pretty emo.
Disagree? Well shuddupayaface
because I once talked to them
and they freely admitted to hav-
ing kick-started the British strain
of emo (Brit-emo? Limyemo? Fish
‘n’ Ch-emo?). They suggested that
perhaps they were, and I misquote,
‘The Grandfathers of British emo’.
Nothin’ to be proud of boys, and
also, up until latest offering The
Chance also factually incorrect.
The ‘Reasons debut Ideas Above
our Station was imaginative and
novel for this country, a prime ex-
ample of what, for want of a bet-
ter name, I’d call Brit Rock. Other
such advocates of this were Kinesis
(the political band of the scene),
Hell is For Heroes (the pop band
of the scene), Aereogramme (the
heavy band on the scene), Reuben
(the teenagers of the scene) and
Biffy Clyro (the most imaginative
of the scene). Unfortunately for the
‘Reasons even though they predate
these bands, and I think I’m correct
in saying that all of them have sup-
ported HR at some point, they’ve
never really had the success and/or
critical acclaim that has been en-
joyed by the others.
The band is technically excellent
live, and many of their songs are
complex, but to be honest they’re
boring. Now new single The Chance
is about the dullest thing that’s ever
been played on my shiny new MP3
player. The band sound bored; it’s
quiet, it’s repetitive, no real struc-
ture, simplistic drumming, and an
emo-er than thou “Will you remem-
ber me now” outro.
In contrast the b-side, the yawn-
somely titled Live Fast, Die Ugly is
over-the-top rock. It’s not a patch
on their previous work; it’s achingly
obvious Hundred Reasons by num-
bers. Oh well guys, you had a good
run, and you can probably continue
half selling-out the Astoria for three
years if you have good enough tour-
ing partners. Proof that fancy web-
sites and nifty graphical design
cannot save your career.
James Millen
man yelping along to his admittedly
pretty funky songs makes my fists
itch, so I’ll humour them.
Dance-like drum rhythm. Check.
Squelchy bassline. Check. Slightly
yelpy nonsensical lyrics. Check.
Goes on for about 8 minutes. Check.
It has got nice touches, like a piano
intro, some good use of guitar (a
lot of this kind of music has awful
guitar), and a bit of nifty chanting
towards the end. You know, it prob-
ably took them a day in the studio,
but they put in some sort of effort.
Except with the b-sides, I hate
it when the b-sides are just two
remixes and a radio edit, and every
The Kooks in a scene of cabbage-leaf green
The Hundred Reasons could do with a riff-sandwich to pick them up

I
s anyone else extremely
bored with the amount of
coverage given to any old
politician giving their two
cents on the ‘veil debate’? I
have ceased to have an opin-
ion either way and have been
reduced to an apolitical mess. A
worm of opinion if you will. I am
going to take you on a tenuous
journey related to this, so hold
on.
Something I feared as a result
of all this talk is giving London
band The Veils publicity. I am
somewhat surprised that the
lead singer of this band has
chirped in with what he thinks
we should do with people’s
religious freedom. If you look-
ing for an answer to extremism
and integration – not that kind,
maths fans – then don’t look for
it in between the mundane lyrics
of said band. Quite frankly, The
Veils are boring and typical of 3
million guitar bands around at
the minute.
Which leads me onto the point
of this rants. Guitar music has
seen a bit of a renaissance lately,
what with My Chemical Ro-
mance becoming chart toppers.
Now, don’t get me wrong, guitar
music was my first love but I
can’t help sighing with disil-
lusionment at every new band
that gets labelled with the ‘up
and coming’ tag. None of these
attempt to be challenging or
innovative.
Yes, I am a music purist. But
it isn’t just me who is bored by
the current crop of ‘indie’ bands,
I’m certain of it. I remember
when bands used to say things
with their music but now bands
come along with watered down
messages of watching girls
dance and dancing with girls.
You should give bands who aren’t
immediately accessible but are
innovative a chance. Don’t sub-
mit to the catchy riff or dumb,
obvious hook. That’s what the big
record labels – who want nothing
but your money – want you to do.
To round off my socialist
diatribe, here are three guitar
band reviews. Two that have
been around a while and were
once exciting, now are struggling
to achieve. The other review is
of The Kooks, a young band who
make music for consumption,
not appreciation. This is all my
opinion by the way, please feel
free to challenge it. It would
make a better debate than all
this nonsense about veils.
