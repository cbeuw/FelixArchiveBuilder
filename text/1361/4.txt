ence glasses and put on your busi-
ness head. Which is exactly what
the high energy physicist has done.
Hassard has been involved in the
creation of three separate compa-
nies, all of which make this tricky
transition. The first one is brushed
under the carpet with a muttered
‘dismal’ but the second and the third
are his babies. ‘DeltaDOT’ merges
the physics of high resolution imag-
ing with the biology of molecules

Graduate and Intern Opportunities 2007
We're looking to recruit high-calibre graduates and
summer interns who are a little different from the usual.
We don’t want clones, stereotypes or anyone who fits
neatly into a box. We want sparky individuals ready to
make their mark. Put simply, if you’re ready to take
responsibility, we’re ready to give it.

How to turn science into hard cash
How Imperial physicist John Hassard turned his hard work into hard cash, founding three companies
For all those bright sparks who
rolled up to Imperial College think-
ing: “I’m in! My life is sorted! Roll
out the champagne and silk shirts!”,
the harsh reality eventually dawns
that having a brain full of science
does not a fistful of money make.
And as you soon work out research
pay is pitiful and the city (if you can
get through the minefield of inter-
views) may pay a decent wage but
it will drain your soul.
So how do you turn science into
hard cash? If you’d turned up to
John Hassard’s presentation at the
Launch of IC’s Entrepreneurship
Societies event last Tuesday you
might have a few ideas. Hassard is
a man with his eye on the ball and
a spring in his step. A man who re-
alised that in order to rake in the
dosh you need to take off your sci-
‘The Best Science Books Ever’, an
event organised by the Royal Insti-
tution together with Imperial’s Sci-
ence Communication group, asked
three experts on popular science
writing to nominate their candi-
dates for best book.
The Guardian’s former science
editor Tim Radford went for Primo
Levi’s The Periodic Table, a mem-
oir with its metaphorical roots in
chemistry. Armand Leroi, biologist
and author, chose an inspirational
book on animal behaviour, Konrad
Lorenz’s King Solomon’s Ring.
Lastly, Sara Abdulla, publisher and
theatre buff, praised the skilful writ-
ing of Tom Stoppard’s brilliant play
Arcadia.
Lively debate among the panel
and audience identified other au-
thors and books with strong claims.
Although there could be only one
And the winner is... Primo Levi

John Hassard, reader in physics at Imperial, founded the tidal power
company HydroVenturi Ltd and biotechnology company DeltaDot
winner on the night, the discussion
brought out the characteristics
defining the best books of the sci-
ence writing genre – successfully
covering a big idea, getting across
what we know of the world, showing
how science is done, and, not least,
achieving high literary quality.
The Periodic Table ticked the box-
es and won the popular vote. Primo
Levi deserves a place on every-
body’s bookshelf. In the words of
Saul Bellow: “This is a book that is
necessary to read.”
to enable us to ‘See the Molecule
not the Label’ (the tag-line on the
website www.deltadot.com.) The
entrepreneurial bit of this invention
is the absence of a pesky intrusion
into the imaging process – the la-
bel – a fluorescent chemical applied
to the molecule that enables you to
‘see’ it. Basically it gets in the way,
Hassard’s team have used their
combined disciplines to remove it
and sell the new technology.
The third and potentially most
exciting company is HydroVenturi,
a company that puts a spin on tidal
power, the classic renewable energy
source by adding some tweaks that
make it just that bit better. Why?
Because Hassard thinks big and
energy is ‘the biggest fish’ of them
all. Where there is a problem, ac-
tually a catastrophe loom-
ing on the horizon that
is the whole world’s
interest to solve
there is money to
be made. Basi-
cally the bit that
sticks out of the
water is called
the ‘head’ and
HydroVenturi’s
genius is mak-
ing the head as
small as possi-
ble, but not too
small – as the
man eloquently
puts it “Don’t even
bother getting out
of bed for more
than 10
metres of head’”. Sounds good to
me. This is Hassards advice to bud-
ding entrepreneurs – find a sizeable
problem and use your sought after
science knowledge to solve it, and
to do this you’re going to have cross
over into business territory. It’s a
scary thought.
But on listening, frankly en-
thralled, to the man for the dura-
tion of his speech there is no dis-
guising the fact that for all his Alan
Sugar-like business sense Hassard
is a physicist at heart. If for no other
reason than he calls the symbols on
the board his ‘guys’ (a classic physi-
cist trait), but also because he has
the stimulating energy of a man
who has the recognisable passion
for his useless subject. But in con-
trast to his crazy haired colleagues
his application of the subject
renders it not so useless.
Hassard believes that
“physicists need to
justify their exist-
ence”, a sentiment
certainly not shared
by everyone. But
with a passion and
deep love of his
work as well as
more money than
you could ever
earn in the square
mile just waiting
to fall into his wal-
let, it’s Hassard and
the entrepreneurs
who are going to
have the last
laugh.
