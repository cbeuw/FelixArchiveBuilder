Student wins championship
The 2006 Quest adventure race
series had been one of mixed emo-
tions. The first race of the season
took place in April in the New Forest
where the fast flat tracks suited me.
I was pleased to score more points
than anyone else (820 points); how-
ever, this was overshadowed by the
fact I had picked up a time penalty,
which dropped me back to second
place despite sharing an equal
number of points with the even-
tual race winner. Unperturbed, I
focussed on the next race, held at
the end of May in the Brecon Bea-
cons. I was confident I’d be able to
make amends; however, I stupidly
spent too much time and effort bik-
ing. This was a big mistake as the
heavy rains meant it was quicker to
run rather than bike along many of
the tracks. Consequently, my score
suffered, and I was only able to
collect a disappointing 630 points.
This was a real low point to my sea-
son. I had raced to the limit of my
physical capacity, and yet I finished
some way off the pace. In the future
I vowed to take more time to think
about decisions. With the bad result
behind me, the pressure was off for
the third race of the series staged
on the Isle of Purbeck in July. I got
off to a flying start and managed to
clear the kayaking stage with less
than a minute to spare. Next came
the biking, where I visited all but
one of the checkpoints which set me
up nicely for the running. I was sure
my final score of 805pts was good
enough for top spot. However, as
the results were read out I couldn’t
hide my disappointment at only get-
ting third place. The chap who had
piped me in the first race of the sea-
son had done it again. He came sec-
ond with an equal number of points
but he pushed me into third as he
collected them in a faster time.
So with just one race left in the
season, on September 16, I was still
looking for my first elite race win. I
was placed third in the series over-
all, but with only three out of the
four races counting towards the
championship I still had an outside
chance of stealing the top spot. To
do this I’d have to perform better
than I ever had before.
Race day began rather sleepily
at 5am with a drive to the Wiltshire
Downs. There I raced against 300
other competitors, running, biking
and kayaking to collect as many
points as possible in the six hour
time limit. Almost immediately af-
ter setting off I’d made a couple of
bad decisions but it wasn’t until I
fell off my bike into a patch of sting-
ing nettles that it hit home. Unde-
terred, I battled on, having to miss
out some checkpoints. I started
the kayaking late so there was no
way I would be able to visit all the
controls, thus I took it easy, con-
serving energy for the run. By the
time I clambered out of my canoe
my legs had seized. They loosened
up once I got moving but the first
few minutes were hard work. I had
to visit all the running checkpoints
to have any chance of winning the
series. It was a big gamble, but I
paced myself and it paid off. Having
cleared the run, I was back on my
bike to pick up a few more points on
the way to the finish. As I knew all
too well, if points are shared, then
positions were decided on time, so I
kept pushing hard right to the line.
Later,theresultswereannounced.
I’d scored 810 points – enough to
win the race and with it the series.
It was close. After 24 hours of rac-
ing, just five points separated me
from my nearest rival but it didn’t
matter. I was the 2006 Quest adven-
ture race series champion!

Middlesex found themselves in
league 1A after BUSA’s restruc-
turing, and were prepared for the
higher standard of rugby.
The match started with an en-
thusiastic Middlesex using their
large forwards trying to break the
IC defence, which was strong until
midway through the first half when
Middlesex tried a rare wide attack.
Taken by surprise, IC backs were
sucked into leaving a gap for their
centre to sneak through and score.
Imperial were straight back at
Middlesex with the forwards punch-
ing up the right touch line with some
great off-loads. The ball was then
spread left with quick hands from
the IC backs where it found Flan-
nan, who crossed the try line… and
then the dead ball line, after briefly
losing his concentration thinking
he saw a mirror nearby!
Imperial continued to domi-
nate with new fresher fly-half, Joe
Brown, sniping through a gap for a
fresher’s try. 5-7 down at half time,
Imperial were unlucky to be losing.
Imperial, determined not to lose
thier opening match, came out all
guns blazing. Words and fists were
exchanged, but thankfully Jov came
out better looking than before.
Middlesex, not up to IC fitness, let
their defence slip and fresher Alex
Johnson scored in the corner at
the end of a good series of off-loads.
Imperial seemed in control with
good ball retention, which was con-
firmed with an old IC rugby face,
Alex O’Rourke, stormed over, drag-
ging a number of Middlesex players
with him.
Just to confirm the IC dominance,
Joe Brown broke the Middlesex de-
fence in the last move of the game.
Imperial, not at their best, but
with a good win (final score: 26-7)
and lots of potential from new arriv-
als to the 1st team, Ben, Mike, Joe,
Alex and Dan, and strong perform-
ances from the old guard, Andy
(man of the match), Hixxy, & Nath.
