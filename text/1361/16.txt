Kay Adshead’s take on black peo-
ple’s willingness to reinvent their
society after apartheid is the major
theme of her play Bones, currently
premiering at The Bush Theatre,
Shepherd’s Bush.
Written and directed by Adshead,
women-led theatre company Mama
Quillohelpedinitsproduction,offer-
ing a uniquely female perspective.
Indeed, the only two characters in
the play are female: a white South
African woman (played by Pauline
Moran) and her black maidserv-
ant (Sarah Niles). The play follows
the guilt of the white woman, Jen-
nifer, as she inwardly shoulders the
blame of the atrocities carried out
by her dying husband while Beauty,
her maid, takes advantage of this
to make a fast buck out of her em-
ployer using her alleged healing
powers.
A sparsely decorated stage floor
greeted members of the audi-
ence, with live drumming from Joe
Legwabe, which set the African
theme perfectly. The play begins
with a spotlight on a young black
boy (played by Sarah Niles) being
interrogated. The scene changes in
the beginning of the play are abrupt
and at first the lack of direction left
me a little hesitant as to my enjoy-
ment of the remainder of it.
However, Niles picked up the pace
with her witty and often impertinent
retorts to her employer, Jennifer,
carried out with great conviction.
Jennifer, racked with guilt at what
she had witnessed her husband do
to the black boy of the first scene,
years before, is hoodwinked into
paying Beauty a hefty sum to cast
a spell to save her husband’s soul
- Adshead wanting to illustrate the
need for the white people to be ab-
solved of their crimes committed
throughout apartheid.
Moran does well in acting the
tortured soul, fraught with tension
after 42 years in an unhappy mar-
riage, yet her erratic South African
accent let her down. Her neurosis
as Jennifer is entertaining in the
way it contrasts with Beauty’s com-
ical interludes. Though one did get
a sense that there was something
lacking, passion perhaps, in Mo-
ran’s overall performance.
As Adshead intended, it is Jenni-
fer who is left cheated when realis-
ing Beauty has no healing power
but is merely trying to make a liv-
ing in the troubles times in which
she lives. Despite thoroughly en-
joying the development of the plot
and theatrical techniques used to
evoke such tension (Legwabe’s
haunting singing and drum beats),
by the end I felt the play had been a
bit too heavy going for a Wednesday
evening after a day of using one’s
brain. But before I could go back to
my initial impression, once again
the play redeemed itself by ending
on an uplifting note.
Beauty experiences a rare mo-
ment of genuine healing power and
is possessed by the boy Jennifer
saw her husband torture, and he in
turn forgives both Jennifer and her
husband. The play ends with the two
talking of the flowers they would
replant in the garden. Although
at times a little heavy, Adshead’s
“Bones” is not one to be missed, if
only to see the utterly stunning and
convincing performance by Sarah
Niles, who no doubt will go far.

Accused of perpetuating teenage
anorexia with size-zero models,
and with the ugly link between last
spring’s Boho fade and child labour
in India exposed by The Sunday
Times, it seems there are lots of
devils somewhere in fashion (pos-
sibly wearing Prada) but it seems
that Miranda Priestley’s evilness
has passed us by.
We at The Imperial Collection
have decided to put on a charity
fashion show of up and coming Af-
rican designers with the mission of
show casing African creativity and
helping trade and not just aid to the
impoverished continent.
If you haven’t already heard
there’s a fashion fusion happening
at The Great Hall in the Sherfield
Building on the night of Friday 3rd
November, 2006.
The Imperial Collection, a com-
posite fashion show of eight design-
ers, was a phrase used by none oth-
er than British Vogue Editor Dolly
Jones in an article she wrote about
a previous Imperial College Charity
Fashion Show. Work on the mam-
moth project began over a year ago
when Angelika Huwiler, President
of Wye Fashion, booked the Great
Hall and decided to throw a huge
event in the name of ethical African
fashion.
With frantic emailing and tel-
ephoning throughout the summer
and a constant barrage of hurdles to
make everything flawless, Angelika
says, “When brilliant minds come
together for one common goal, the
result is perfection”; and fresh from
South Africa Fashion Week, as well
as a spell at the Storm modelling
agency, Angelika certainly knows
her stuff.
African styling is making big
strides in fashion. Most recently,
elements of African and oriental
styles were spotted in Donna Ka-
ran’s Spring 2007 offering. The Im-
perial Collection will display a wide
variety of lines, including amongst
others Jewels by Lisa, Arrogant
Cat, Ajayi by Lanre Da Silva, and
Virtuoso by Yemisi Olagbaiye.
All the profits made from the
event are going to World Vision,
the international relief and devel-
opment agency, specifically in aid
of a project in Uganda. The char-
ity was chosen for its outstanding
reputation in helping over 100 mil-
lion people in their struggle against
poverty, hunger, and injustice.
With rehearsals in full swing,
I’m still on a high from having the
contact details of the most beauti-
ful guys and girls at Imperial, and
I’m telling you they are utterly gor-
geous! With expert styling from
The Ray Cochrane Beauty School,
they can only get better. I feel very
powerful!
Invitations are being sent to
all the top fashionistas including
Vogue, Marie Claire, and the BBC,
and together with an after party at
the über-happening Roof Garden
Club we’re hoping for the glitziest
night on the Imperial calendar. See
you there!

Have you ever sat down and thought
how perfectly adorable the bastard
child of the Muppets and South
Park would look? If you have, you’re
dreams have come true.
The Broadway triumph ‘Avenue Q’,
created by Jeff Marx and Robert
Lopez, is a musical for a generation
that grew up with Sesame Street
and don’t think musicals are very
cool, really.
Hilarious,rude,loud,extravagant,
and constantly pitting the cynical
against the soppy (read on to find
out who wins); you come out with
your cheeks aching from laughter
and a sense of wonder at how re-
alistic a puppet sex scene can be
when they only exist from the waist
upwards.
The story is set around the wide-
eyed Princeton (“What Do You Do
With A BA In English Literature?”),
an optimistic college graduate who
moves to a scruffy New York street,
and the colourful friends he makes
there.
These include love interest Kate
Monster, a fuzzy kindergarten as-
sistant who likes romance with eve-
rything; Rod the “not a homo-what-
ever!” investment banker; and Lucy
the Slut (who makes Miss Piggy
look like the Virgin Mary); as well
as the riotous Trekkie Monster.
There are human characters
present too, who come across like
amiably twisted versions of chil-
dren’s television presenters with
their bright clothes and fixed grins,
and serve to remind us how strange
a format a stage peopled by a cast
of grey-clothed puppeteers who
sing, dance, and race around with
the furry creatures of the musical
on their arms really is. This pres-
entation does take a little getting
used to, but eventually proves to
add a remarkably energetic and
entertaining extra dimension to the
performance.
The band is fairly traditional,
but the songs certainly aren’t, and
these are the star appeal of the
show. This author’s personal fa-
vourites include the ironic lyrics of
“For Now” (‘Everyone feels a little
bit empty inside,’ they’re puppets,
geddit?), and the genius of “The In-
ternet Is For Porn”.
Avenue Q is a wicked and comi-
cal representation of the strug-
gle of youth in the modern world,
with all its temptations and vices
which appear in the form of the two
cute “Bad Idea Bears” that dance
around Princeton, encouraging him
to spend his last pennies on beer in
true student fashion.
The show deals impudently with
themes of morality, ambition, and
the individual’s search for purpose
and sex; ultimately concluding in
good old-fashioned sentimentality,
charmingly shirking away from the
tragic realities of life that it dar-
ingly grazes. Well, they’re only pup-
pets after all. What do you expect?
Bloody Ibsen?
