RSM’s first game of the season
began in the usual style, with
most people struggling to see
after Saturday night house par-
ties across West London. With
the sweet taste of Jack Daniel’s
and Fosters vomit still on my
breath (sorry Holly; at least it
all went down the toilet) the
Mixed XI took to the pitch full of
confidence for a victory over a
bunch of IC players who looked
as hanging as we felt.
I’d love to give you a full
match report of our first half
dominance and silky inter-linked
plays, but to be honest I can’t
remember a fucking thing from
the whole weekend. Tom scored
an absolute beauty, taking the
ball from the half-way line and
threading through a bemused
defence before hammering it
past the flailing IC keeper. Ade’s
debut performance in goal kept
us in the game in the first half,
although a special (speshul)
mention should go to Andreas
(the IC striker) who managed
to miss more easy opportunities
than I’ve had Cornish pasties.
Unfortunately, somewhere along
the way IC scored a couple of
goals, apparently, and we lost
2-1.
Post-match fineage/celebra-
tions were postponed until
after training on Monday. Alice
claimed Man of the Match
for her stunning natural tal-
ent (hockey talent) and was
rewarded with Guinness, Bells,
Baileys and tabasco. Charlotte
got the prestigious Thanks for
Coming award, for doing practi-
cally nothing all day, although in
her defence she did buy us some
booze for half-time drinks. To
her sheer delight she was pre-
sented with Old Hooky, red wine,
Bells, Blue Aftershock, and
more Lea & Perrins Worcester-
shire sauce than I’ve ever seen
go into one drink before.
Special thanks to Sarah and
the IC team for the game; we
should do that again some time.
If anyone happened to walk past
the Union on Tuesday morning,
and was wondering what the 3-
square-metre patch of unidenti-
fied purple substance was, I’m
sure Charlotte would be happy
to explain (ca305@imperial.

Havingfinished2ndinULU&ascup
semi-finalists last year, we woke up
on Sunday morning with one thing
in our mind: how the f**** did I get
home last night?
With nearly all the tube lines
closed to King’s Cross and us-
ing Jools’ sense of direction, it
took us nearly three hours to get
to Brookman’s Park. Getting to
RVC grounds meant taking a long
journey through a deserted forest,
walking past the remainders of cars
and animals, climbing hills and fall-
ing into a couple of holes and nearly
getting a pre-season injury. Being
used to playing with the maximum
of 7 players in most of the match-
es last year, having 3 subs meant
Christmas, 2 months early.
The first few strikes by IC in the
first half, led to an early goal by
spaniard Dehydys-“DD”(our very
own Joaquin). Getting too carried
away resulted in a shot by RVC’s
number 12 (aka “the wall”) which
amazingly missed all the defend-
ers. IC’s second goal came from
Harriet’s corner, finding Lizzie G
outside the box.
LG’s amazing Totti-styled shot
arched over and beautifully landed
in RVC’s goal, leaving everyone
impressed, especially the ref, who
couldn’t get over it.
Soon afterwards, RVC was re-
warded a free kick from an Oscar-
winning dive (even better than IC
men’s 7s’ Jack Yip’s) which went
pass the all CivEnged defence and
slipped in.
IC managed to take control of the
game afterwards. Creating con-
stant attacks starting with Harriet
& Yoke’s awesome moves & ending
in DD, LG, Pav & Poppy’s shots.
The third goal was a classic. Win-
ning a corner in the last second of
the first half was an excellent op-
portunity for all 22 players to take
part in it. Harriet’s corner landed
somewhere in the crowded penalty
spot.
With IC having more than 10 shots
and each time, hitting RVC play-
ers instead of scoring, it was hard
to understand what the actual aim
was. DD (known as the girl with
headband to the opponents’ coach),
finally managed to miss RVC play-
ers and the half time finished with
IC leading 3-2.
Having both Lizzies (LG & LB) in
the pitch in the second half, caused
a disastrous confusion on instruc-
tion towards them as G and B were
mixed up. Again we took control
early in the half.
Kate & Emma’s move & Pav’s
ball, which slipped though for Pop-
py, brought the 4th goal. Linesmans’
obsession with offside cost us lots
of good chances. Harriet scored
the 5th, in a rather un-balanced
position, completing her awesome
game that day.
When RVC scored their 3rd, Pav
(the captain) started worrying. That
was when Mona (MLisa) & Poppy,
wisely, started bombarding IC play-
ers with cries of motivation in Span-
ish & Portuguese. The impact was
instant on DD, as she went to score
a fantastic goal, taking advantage
of goalie’s hasty clearance.
Winning a penalty was the high-
light of the match. Although Pop’s
shot was denied by the goalkeeper,
it brought the team closer together
(thanks for the memories Popps).
The game finished with a horrible
tackle on LG & her being carried
to the changing rooms, where we
could still hear the ref, saying , “Did
you see that second goal?”
Being awarded the “double” dame
of the match, DD & Harriet will be
enjoying downing pints on Wednes-
day night along with their fellow
team mates, while trying to figure
out the difference between Kate &
Katie and Imperial & Imeprial (es-
pecially on flyers).
