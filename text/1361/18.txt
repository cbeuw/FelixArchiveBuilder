H
ello my sweet and
juicy children of the
night. Just a short
one this week, but
it’s filled to the brim
with tales of exploits you were too
lazy to be a part of. Why would you
go out though, when a quick jaunt
through the internet can land
you with everything you need to
turn your own living room into a
ravers’ paradise? In minutes you
could have strobe lights, smoke
machines and boxes upon boxes
of glow-sticks winging their way to
your very own door. Now all that’s
left is to borrow some friendly lo-
cal audiophile’s soundsystem and
wait for the cloak of darkness to
envelope you.
Or you could just do what I do
and save a week’s worth of Deal
Or No Deal for a marathon back-
to-back session on a Saturday
night. Or pray that the BBC take
note of my requests for a late night
Neighbours omnibus.

No frills, some spills
Papadiso and Jaded try to convince us that Summer’s not over yet
Summer is not yet over at Papadiso,
a monthly event showcasing a vari-
ety of styles of house music hosted
in Egg Club. From 10pm to 5am
the energy level was sky high in all
three rooms with the crowd raving
to the beats from funky-house to
filthy-electro.
Unlike a typical London club, Egg
is unpretentious in every single
way. Situated in a medium-sized
industrial-looking building near
Kings Cross, the rooms have all
the basic necessities essential to a
good clubbing experience. There is
a spacious dancefloor, quick service
at the bar (the average price for a
spirit with mixer is £4), comfortable
sofas to chill in, energetic clubbers
and most importantly, floor-thump-
ing tunes blasted through some
sick-ass speakers. The security was
also very tight complete with metal
detectors mainly due to a shooting
at the club in August which left a
person dead.
Resident DJ, Shane Watcha and
his filthy crew, Clint Lee and Gepy,
held things down in the basement
with their filthy house sessions,
while Happy Mondays DJs took
control of the terrace. They were
taking the decks back to back with
pure acid house to the delight of
their raving fans. After the Happy
Mondays’ set I did not think anyone
could have superseded it, but Kiss
FM’s Steve Smart and Frisky DJs
kept the clubbers on the dancefloor
ever so frisky.
If you think you are going deaf
from the beats or going crazy with
hallucinations, take a break outside
in the garden where tents were set
up with lounge sofas underneath
and for £2, you can have a 15-second
giggling fit from the laughing gas.
I plead guilty to missing Chocolate
Groove going head-to-head with
Sub-Mission in the Loft, as I came
in just in time to witness them wrap-
ping their set up. The lounge seats
along the walls in the loft not only
looked appealing to us very tired
souls, it also proves a great place to
meet people if the dancefloor is too
packed for comfort or heavy house
music is not your thing.
The crowd is a mixed bunch of
people, mostly in their mid-twen-
ties with the same love for music.
Everyone here is friendly from the
stiletto-wearing Posh Spice wan-
nabe to cowboy-hat clad, glow-stick
waving hardcore raver. Most peo-
ple I talked to were Papadiso regu-
lars and were keen to discuss all
the good times they have had there.
Also, judging from the amount of
times I got asked if I wanted some
Tamil Society
Hit Ruby Blue
In classic Imperial style, freshers’
week for some students involved a
few tests, cheap snake-bite and 3am
conversations. This all changed
(well for the Asians maybe) when
Imperial College International
Tamil Society produced the bi-an-
nual charity clubbing event Twist:
Rewind.
Having Ruby Blue, a funky West
End venue as a backdrop, excellent
build-ups and drops from the DJs
including our resident DJ Harribo.
It is no surprise that the ravers
steamed up a little. The combina-
tion of freshers testing their alco-
hol limits and students from vari-
ous universities coming together
brought the club into a dancing
frenzy.
Sometimes R’n’B nights can get
very commercial, but with the infu-
sion of hip hop, soul, bhangra and
gaana (which only Tamils seem to
‘dance’ to), the event certainly was
a proud success as a lot of money
was raised on the night.
So, I just want to say a big thank
you to the committee members of
International Tamil Society 06/07
especially to Ramyah who made
journeys to various universities to
promote the event and Sarah who
made the night possible.
Finally, Make sure you keep an
eye out for our biggest variety show,
Mega Maalai that will be coming
your way!
Sinthiya Punnialingam
party-food, they like to make sure
you are having the time of your life
too!
All good things do not have to end,
as we discovered when the Jaded
after-party kicked off at 6am. wit-
nessing Sunday morning hardcore
clubbers thumping the dancefloor
with ferocious energy is unusual
in those ungodly hours. We left the
place around 10am, smiling into the
glaring morning sun, knowing it
was a night (or day!) well spent.
Papadiso in Egg Club is the place
to be if you are up for getting down.
This are no frills, no pretenses, no
holds barred, pure hardcore club-
bing. Not for the faint hearted.
