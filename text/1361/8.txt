Letter
from an
ex-editor
Who will influence whom?
A
s postgraduates, we’ve
been around Imperial
for quite a while – 5 or
6 years in fact. We re-
member the last NUS
debate, which was full-bodied and
lively, with a sabbatical leading the
Yes campaign and an ex-sabb lead-
ing the No campaign. The result
was an overwhelming 72% in favour
of remaining outside the NUS.
This time around things have
changed. The key argument is that
once we pull out of the University of
London we’ll no longer have a un-
ion bigger than us – University of
London Union in this case – to fight
our corner at a higher level. Many
poor misguided souls feel we will
have no voice without joining the
NUS, as evidenced by the publicity
stunt during freshers week (see the
photo on the article). They need to
take a serious look at what’s going
on around them.
The key question to ask, is “would
we influence the NUS, or be influ-
enced by them?” The answer is
plain to see, if you look at the atti-
tude of certain sabbaticals. The ICU
website contains an announcement
by Deputy President (Education
& Welfare) Ben Harris of the NUS
anti-fees march on Sunday.
Whilst the march is a worthwhile
venture, ICU appears to be losing
an independent voice already. Im-
perial’s delegation will join the NUS
London region, rather than working
with non-NUS affiliated institutions
such as Southampton.
The NUS introduces the cam-
paign on its website as follows:
“Top-up fees of up to £3,000 are
here. Student debt is at its highest
and applications to university de-
creased by nearly 4% this year. This
Is it in the interests of Imperial students to pay tens of thousands of pounds to the
NUS when our interests often confict with some of those of the current members?
“If we join, our
voice will get
drowned out in
an organisation
full of career
politicians and
those student
activists more
concerned with
foreign policy
than student
issues”

Dear Andy,
Firstly, congratulations on hit-
ting the ground running as the
new ‘Editor-in-Chief’ of Felix.
However, I couldn’t help but feel
a little upset with some of your
coverage these first few weeks.
I’m not entirely sure why you
feel you have had to belittle my
editorship of Felix on so many
occasions – in your (otherwise
excellent) handbook, in your first
editorial of the year and in last
week’s edition.
You may not agree with
some of the things we did last
year, but winning four Guard-
ian Student Media Nomina-
tions is quite a success story.
“In what may surprise some
of those he antagonized in the
Union and College, the previous
editor, Rupert Neate, has been
nominated twice”, is sniping and
counterproductive. To write such
a disparaging news story and
rather pettily choosing a weird
picture of me (face painted as a
Tiger) seems a little… bitter?
Telling the readers of your first
editorial you had “inherited a
Felix thoroughly disliked by both
staff and students” is just untrue
(sorry if it’s not a direct quote,
but you haven’t updated the web-
site at all despite promising to do
so in your election campaign).
At the end of the day, you’re
not just insulting me by belittling
Felix’s success, but all those who
worked so hard to make the pa-
per what it was last year – many
of whom still work on your staff.
It’s a shame you can’t feel
proud of the fact that Felix has
been nominated four times. Per-
haps you should stop attacking
my editorship and concentrate
on what really matters to read-
ers – doing a good job with yours.
Yours,
Rupert Neate
Felix Editor 2005-2006
Dear Rupert,
Firstly, thanks for your compli-
ments on my handbook.
I feel the opinions expressed in
my editorial adequately backed
up the feelings of the general
population of the College. As
for the editorial team, well, they
seem happy with my leadership;
the free pizza for those working
with me late at night might have
helped. That tiger photo is appar-
ently one of your favourites; you
used it for your columns in the
past. Perhaps you’ve forgotten?
If you take a look at the website
now, you’ll see a placeholder. The
new site will launch next term.
Good luck with your journalism
course; I’m sure you’ll fit right in.
Yours,
Andy Sykes

situation is only set to get worse.”
Ben Harris provides the following
take on the campaign on the union
website, “Top-up fees of £3000 have
arrived on campus. Student debt
stands at record levels and looks
set to reach up to £44,000. And it’s
about to get worse.” Much of the
text appears to come directly from
the NUS, with a small degree of
paraphrasing. The impression is
of a union whose fees policy is be-
ing driven by the NUS campaign,
rather than an independent, freely
discussed ICU policy.
If our policies are already influ-
enced by the NUS, what would
happen when we finally joined?
ICU should be defending its own
students, not students all across
the country. Our lab-based cours-
es require an increase in funding
from somewhere, presumably from
cheaper non-lab courses. A cen-
tral national body (the NUS) will
be obliged to defend funding for all
courses, even though it would not
be best for our current and future
students.
Another question to ask is what
degree of representation would we
get from a group so fundamentally
different from us in their views?
While the NUS national conference
discusses issues such as foreign af-
fairs, Imperial tries to keep those
out of union committees, preferring
to focus on student issues instead.
We would be one voice among thou-
sands, no more powerful than un-
ions such as Manchester – a union
which has not spoken to its Vice
Chancellor for several years, be-
cause of his stance on fees.
If we join, our own voice will get
drowned out in an organisation full
of career politicians and those stu-
dent activists more concerned with
foreign policy than student issues.
We have no voice that can be heard.
What’s worse, we might even end
up with policies at odds with our
needs, due to policies drifting down-
wards from the NUS. Former NUS
presidents – Charles Clarke for ex-
ample – actively pushed for top-up
fees despite the NUS opposition.
If we do not join, we have only our
own voice. We will need to shout
loudly to be heard, but we cannot
be suppressed by the views of other
unions who’s needs our different
from ours. We are the 3rd-best uni-
versity in the country and 9th-best
in the world. We have the 4th-best
medical school in the world, after
Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard.
We have a loud voice if we want
one – look at the fuss over the dress
code. That debacle resulted in the
Guardian linking to our news serv-
er, along with coverage on London
Tonight, BBC News Online, India
Times, The Daily Mail and even The
Register. Finally, there was the top-
up fees debate from 2002 in which
the silent protest was covered by
the press.
Let’s not forget that the NUS lost
thelasttop-upfeecampaignandhas
had very few successes in England
while the Labour government has
been in power. A lot of NUS officers
want to become Labour MPs (and
often succeed), which may have
something to do with it. Our fluffy
pro-NUS sabbs – ICU President
John Collins and DPEW Ben Har-
ris – are also both supporters of the
Labour party, along with the leader
of the ‘Yes’ campaign, Alex Guite.
When voting, think very carefully
about whose welfare these people
are looking out for.
