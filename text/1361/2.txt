Spying on students?
A draft paper leaked from the De-
partment of Education, obtained by
the Guardian, has incited a new row
about extremism on UK university
campuses.
The paper urges university staff
and lecturers to report any stu-
dents that are involved in ‘suspi-
cious’ activities to special branch,
and acknowledges that this will
result in “concerns about the police
targeting certain sections of the
student population (e.g. Muslims)”.
The draft paper, which was sent
for consultation to official bodies
is reported to focus on factors that
radicalise students, with specific
attention paid to the role played by
Islamic societies on campus. It dis-
cusses the possibility of monitoring
any Islamic society’s leaflets and
speakers, and warns of the dangers
of terrorists “talent-spotting” on
campus and “grooming students
for terrorism”.
The paper was leaked at a time
when the Government is under
strain with regards to its attitude
towards British Muslims, after Jack
Straw’s request that a constituent
remove her niqab (face-covering
veil) when speaking to him resulted
in outrage amongst many British
Muslims.
The paper devotes a section to
factors that can drive students to
extremism, and lists a number of
contributing reasons; these include
a feeling of “segregation” from Brit-
ish society, extremism in their origi-
nal hometowns, and the influence of
radical speakers. On the subject of
invited speakers, it advises keeping
a close eye on invited speakers and
committee members: “The control
of university or college Islamic so-
cieties by certain extremist indi-
viduals can play a significant role in
the extent of Islamist extremism on
campus.” It worries that the influ-
ence of these “charismatic, persua-
sive and eloquent” speakers can tap
into feelings of alienation common
to students arriving at university.
It is true that extremists have
been operating on campuses in the
UK for the past few years. In the
recent foiled terror plot to blow up
airlines travelling from the UK to
the US with explosives, one Islamic
society president was arrested air
side while allegedly trying to smug-
gle explosives on board an aircraft.
In a far less clear-cut case in 2003,
Babar Ahmed, a Information Tech-
nology Support worker at the Col-
lege, was arrested on charges un-
der the Terrorism Act, and police
raided rooms in Mechanical Engi-
neering to seize computers. He is
currently awaiting extradition to
the US. And at last year’s Freshers’
Fair, individuals acting under the
name “Stop Islamophobia” were
attempting to recruit students for
Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamicist party
that was facing a ban under pro-
posed anti-terror legislation.
The outcry over the leak has been
widespread. Gemma Tumulty, the
NUS President, compared it to Mc-
Carthyism, adding: “They are going
totreateveryMuslimwithsuspicion
on the basis of their faith.” Wakkas
Khan, president of the Federation
of Student Islamic Societies, wor-
ried about the lack of moderation
shown by the paper: “It sounds to
Halal food debate
The rising number of Muslims on
British university campuses has
caused a surge in the number of
universities serving halal food,
though some, including the Secular
Society at Oxford University, have
protested against the lack of op-
tions available.
Halal simply means “permis-
sible” in Arabic; the act of halal
slaughter is called dhabiha. This
act involves first checking if the
animal is healthy; if so, the animal
is given water to drink and pointed
towards Mecca. The slaughter man
then says a brief prayer, and slices
open the large arteries in the neck
of the animal. This helps drain the
corpse of blood, as the consumption
of blood is forbidden in Islam.
At Leicester University, students
managed to get pork banned from
the union’s food outlet, and all other
dishes are now exclusively halal. At
Sheffield, a branch of Hally Ally’s, a
fast food company that serves only
halal food, has opened on campus.
The Union serves halal food, which
is clearly marked on the menus. Ac-
cording to Jon Matthews, Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
said that chicken served by the
Union is “almost entirely halal”.
In College food outlets, the story
is similar. In a statement made to
Felix, a catering manger in College
said: “The majority of chicken we
serve is halal… beef and lamb are
not currently halal. We identify on
menus with an “H” all dishes that
are halal.”
At Oxford University, recently the
centre of a furious animal rights
row, some chefs have refused to
prepare halal meat because of con-
cerns over the way it is slaughtered.
The University’s Secular Society
has also protested the introduction
of entirely halal dishes, arguing that
one group’s religious requirements
should not be forced on to another.
Mr Matthews responded to this
concern, saying: “We never have
an entirely halal menu, so other op-
tions are available. Why would non-
Muslim students care about halal?”
The College caterer takes a similar
line: “As the taste and quality is the
same as non-halal meat, this does
not affect the menu choices for our
non-Muslim customers.”
Research into the dhabiha meth-
od of slaughter is inclusive with
regards to animal suffering. While
some academics have stated it to
be one of the fastest methods of kill-
ing an animal, and that the draining
of blood results in a relatively pain-
less death, animal rights groups
contend that it causes unneces-
sary suffering compared to modern
methods that stun the animal prior
to slaughter. The Government-
funded Farm Animals Welfare
Council has recommended that the
conventional form of dhabiha that
takes places without any stunning
should be abolished.
Some have raised questions over
the accommodation of Islamic eat-
ing habits, arguing that Jewish stu-
dents should be able to obtain ko-
sher food on campus. However, as
Mr Matthews says, this would likely
require an entirely separate kitch-
en in order to ensure that milk and
meat are never handled together
or with the same utensils, whereas
halal food requires far less work to
accommodate.
Almost all the chicken served by the Union is now halal
A leaked government paper suggests universities monitor
“suspicious students” over fears of extremism on UK campuses
me to be potentially the widest in-
fringement of the rights of Muslim
students that there has ever been
in this country. It sounds like you’re
guilty until you’re proven innocent.”
In defence of the plans, Ruth Kelly,
the communities secretary, reiter-
ated that academic staff were not
“spying” but rather “monitoring
students”. Paul Mackney, joint gen-
eral secretary of the University and
College Union, also drew compari-
sons with the McCarthy era, and
said the paper had “major implica-
tions for academic freedom, civil
liberties.”
A paper put to Union Council on
Monday night by Camilla Royle, a
student closely involved with SWSS
and Student Respect, which con-
demned Islamophobia and asked
that the body got in touch with Col-
lege authorities to ask whether stu-
dents’ details were being passed to
Special Branch. It seems, however,
that those fears are misplaced. This
reporter contacted Rees Rawlings,
Pro-Rector for Educational Quality,
asking if there were any plans to
monitor affiliations of students or
to specifically monitor Muslim stu-
dents and societies. Mr Rawlings
replied succinctly: “Your questions
are simple to answer. The answers
are no, and no.”
