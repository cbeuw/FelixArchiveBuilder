This year’s Gliding Club tour hap-
pened to start on the longest day
of the year. Lasham, our home air-
field, had decided to try and get as
many flights into the day a possible,
which was handy; not only did the
early morning start seem more
bearable but some of us even man-
aged to go flying before leaving! A
largely uneventful journey across
Belgium, Germany and Austria
found the group in Nitra, Slovakia.
Nitra is about 60km west of the
capital Bratislava and 8km away
from the Tribec Mountains. The
airfield has hosted numerous World
and European gliding champion-
ships, so has very good facilities
including a swimming pool and a
tennis court (very useful when you
weren’t flying). We stayed on the
airfield in chalets, which were only
20m from where the glider trailers
were parked, so we could easily
fall out of bed each morning and
assemble our single seater Discus
(no assembly required for our twin
seater, 496, which was either in the
hanger or trestled overnight). The
airfield doesn’t have any catering
facilities (only a bar), but we were
able to get food at Nitra’s two Tes-
cos, one of which was actually on
three separate floors! We went out
most evenings and attempted to
sample some of the more local cui-
sine, including an Italian, a Mexican
and an Irish restaurant (the origins
of the Irish one were questionable),
two homemade barbeques, and a
very good local restaurant where, if
you ordered 2 days in advance, you
could get a whole suckling pig. One
fact that seemed to pass most of the
restaurants was that when Sage
said he was vegetarian, this means
he eats no meat (Slovakian dishes
‘without meat’ may just contain less
meat). We also made evening trips
to Bratislava and Banska Bystrica;
the latter is a historic town in the
middle of the Tribec Mountains.
Some of us later returned to Brati-
slava on a poor weather day whilst
the others climbed the local ridge.
The first day was spent flying
with instructors in the twin seater,
to make sure everyone was safe to
fly on their own. Launching was by
winch, where the glider is hooked
onto a mile long cable which is
reeled in at 60mph to catapult you
into the air. The Nitra winch was
not the smooth, powerful launch
we’re used to at home (the aver-
age launch was to a pathetic height
of 700 feet), and was initiated by
swinging a very heavy metallic bat
around your head. The problem
was the winch driver could barely
see this bat from the other end of
the airfield, so some people found
themselves standing there wav-
ing for more than 5 minutes! Once
under way the sticky clutch caused
some jerky launches, and having
broken every weak link (a replace-
able part on the cable designed to
break before the glider does) on the
airfield we decided not to use the
winch again. The rest of the launch-
es were by aerotow, a more sedate
way of getting airborne where a
powered aircraft tows your glider
up to altitude.
Generally the weather was su-
perb by British standards, with fan-
tastic soaring conditions allowing
us to stay in the air for more than
5 hours at a time by riding on col-
umns of rising hot air. This allowed
those who were pre-solo to do a lot
soaring practice and upper air work
with instructors, and those who
could fly the single seater were able
to practice their soaring and go for
badge claims. There were a daring
few (mainly flying with Bob) that
went out to the local ridge. I say
daring because, as we saw when
we climbed it, if the ridge lift wasn’t
strong enough to keep the plane up
it would be a long way to glide back
to the airfield with very little height
to spare!
The locals were all very friendly
and helpful, and the youth contin-
gent even allowed us to join in their
drinking games; their shot glasses
were the size of tumblers and the
homebrew was lethal (the normal
8 hour minimum before flying was
nowhere near a long enough recov-
ery time!)
Overall, everyone there got some-
thing out of it. Pre-solo students
were able to learn in a familiar glid-
er in superb conditions and those
who flew the Discus were able to
hone their thermalling skills. Thank
you to Bob and Sage for their hard
work instructing and mentoring
during the first two weeks; Sage
even managed a bit of flying of his
own in the last week when he had
no one to instruct!
Up, up and
away with IC
Gliding Club
An unusual choice of holiday destination
perhaps, but Slovakia managed to provide
soaring skies for everyone involved
Imperial College Gliding Club
meets every Friday lunchtime
at 12.30-13.30 in Aeronautical
Engineering room 254, and
we fly on both days of every
weekend as well as Wednesday
afternoons. For more information
