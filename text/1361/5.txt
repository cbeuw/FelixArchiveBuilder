The Game On exhibition
An inspired recollection of gaming history or a chance for more Nintendo marketing?
The facts don’t entirely speak for
themselves, but they allege that
there are 26,500,000 gamers in the
UK. This ranges from the hardcore
denizens of Azeroth right through
to the Brain Trainers and busi-
nessmen who play Sudoku on their
phone. Whether or not all of these
people are truly ‘gamers’ is a de-
bate in itself, but the numbers do
say this – gaming, in one form or
another, is a part of the nation’s psy-
che. And if it’s technological history,
then the Science Museum want to
play host to it.
But if you’re not convinced by the
numbers, you might be wondering
why the exhibition is gracing the
museum at all. Gaming still has its
neuroses and its stigmas attached,
and even without them it can still
seem all too Pop Culture. Has the
Science Museum sold out?
“I think it’s very important to ac-
tually look at Game On beyond just
what’s in [the exhibition], but also
the whole museum.” Explains Dav-
id Yarnton, the General Manager of
Nintendo UK, speaking at the ex-
hibition’s opening, “The important
thing [Nintendo] see in games, and
the reason why we want to be here,
is because we think of games as
something that gives young people
the opportunity to get inspiration
and have fun.”
If nothing else, Mr. Yarnton knows
the Science Museum’s intentions
pretty well. The exhibition itself is
draped in cool blues and bright col-
ours for the most part, with vibrant
murals by Jon Burgerman – an
artist who has worked for Sony in
the past – and it’s these that really
underline the direction of Game
On, highlighting the content of vid-
eogames, challenging the long-held
stereotypes and clichés, and asking
questions of the future.
But of course, it’s the games that
are the focus – Space Invaders is
projected at an impressive scale
onto the walls, lively platformers
such as Jak And Daxter share floor
space with old classics such as
Elite. It’s an eclectic mix of the past
and the present, offering a whistle-
Rock on. Suits wah-wah their whammys on Guitar Hero for the PS2 at the Game On Exhibition
stop tour of most of the last decades
of gaming.
In Mr. Yarnton’s opening speech,
he hinted at the relationship be-
tween the exhibition and the wider
museum. He described gaming as
something “where kids, by having
fun, [gain] inspiration to further
things in the future.”, and made
mention of the drop in interest in
science across the board. “It’s so
important, I think, at the moment,
and I read all the time in the papers
about young people… but it’s so im-
portant that we get them involved
and participating towards innova-
tion in the future.”
Later,IfindDavidBrabenwander-
ing somewhat bemusedly through
the exhibition. He talks to me about
the exhibition, and about what gam-
ing has been for him in the past two
and a half decades. In front of us,
the Elite console that he donated
to Game On glows and sparkles.
Is there still scope for technologi-
cal innovation and development in
the future? Is there still a future for
science in gaming? “We don’t even
know where the ‘scope’ is,” he says,
“This exhibition is a milestone, it
shows that we’ve reached a turning
point. But it’s no more than the end
of the beginning.”
It’s worth noting that the exhibi-
tion is sponsored by Nintendo it-
self – this doesn’t just mean that
they get exclusive sketches of Don-
key Kong and Mario. It also means
that the exhibition is distinctly lack-
ing in the areas that Nintendo don’t
cover. Metal Gear Solid, Half-Life,
Quake, even Doom are all con-
spicuously absent, and the most
recent Final Fantasy they could
muster was a Playstation conver-
sion of FFVI. The exhibition still
does its job of highlighting some of
the great moments in videogaming
history – but it also has a few pages
missing, particularly as you go on
through time.
In the final chamber of the exhibi-
tion, a projector throws out Guitar
Hero, two-player, onto a screen.
Schoolkids and Suits strum away
to Franz Ferdinand, both equally
amazed and confused by the flurry
of sound and colour. For all its poor
lighting and lack of seating, Game
On is still a charming exhibition of
gaming, and offers a few very rare
chances to glance upon some very
special pieces of gaming history.
From Grand Theft Auto III concept
art through to Spacewar! and an
original PDP-1, there are some real
gems. But it’s unlikely to come into
its own until the Wii and Playsta-
tion3 are released, as this will make
their collection finally complete.
It comes at an interesting time,
a time when gaming is partially
embraced by consumers in gen-
eral, but still at threat from legal
and moral minefields both at home
and further afield. Game On fails to
challenge the image of gaming very
well, and it’s claim of “every game
worth playing” similarly doesn’t
ring true. But it remains a beauti-
ful and rare tour-de-force of some of
the lesser-travelled paths in gam-
ing history.
“It’s exciting,” Braben explains,
with a smile that hasn’t dulled over
24 years of working in the indus-
try, “To write games, to play them.
We’re just beginning.”
Game On, like the industry itself,
still has a lot of work to do.

One of many vivid gaming inspired banners adorning the exhibition
Deranged celebrity behaviour goes
back further than we thought. Re-
cent geological evidence confirms
that for thousands of years, genera-
tions of women in ancient Greece
were acting crazy and becoming
famous for it.
During the 8th century B.C. the
Delphi temple in Greece became
internationally famous for the
prophetic powers of Pythia – the
priestess who sat on a tripod,
inhaled toxic vapours and babbled
predictions of the future. Over hun-
dreds of years, the various Pythia
at Delphi were consulted for advice
on many major decisions and were
the most prestigious and authorita-
tive oracles in the Greek world.
Recent geological investigations
have provided some suggestions
of the source of the Pythia’s de-
ranged behaviour. Two major fault
lines have been discovered under
the temple thought to be responsi-
ble for the release of hallucinogen-
ic gases. These hydrocarbon gases,
such as ethylene, would have
brought about striking neurotoxic
effects in the famous oracle.
However, new research has
shown that it is more likely to be
oxygen deprivation from carbon
dioxide and methane release that
induced trance and delirium in
the oracle. In the enclosed temple
chamber, these gases may have re-
sulted in acute oxygen deprivation.
The research, published in the cur-
rent issue of Geology, also suggests
that the ‘sweet smells’ described
around the temple could have been
from benzene fumes coming from
local springs, although they did not
detect the gas.
This research provides a ra-
tional explanation for the bizarre
antics of the Pythia, though
research is ongoing to uncover
the reasons for the behaviour of
