F
ormula 1 has always been
a fast moving sport; driv-
ers and champions come
and go. Races are won and
in terms of track records,
whoever is vigilente enough to be
standing on a podium is anyones
guess. That is of course with one
exception that has dominated for
the past 15 years. In 1991 a young
German called Michael Schu-
macher came into the sport. His
infamous desire to win at all costs
and genius in driving a Formula 1
car would make him a legend even
before he’d finished his career; a
career which started when a poor
worker knocked together a small
go kart for his 3 year old son in a re-
mote part of West Germany.
During the 1991 season, Eddie
Jordan’s young outfit was running
a French driver called Bertrand
Gachot, who was jailed for spraying
CS gas at a London taxi driver. Jor-
dan were in trouble, they needed
a driver to replace Gachot at the
hallowed Spa-Francorchamps cir-
cuit in Belgium, a track, alongside
the Nurburgring-Nordeschleife,
considered as one of the most fear-
ful places on earth to race a car.
Backed by his success from the jun-
ior racing series leading up to F1
and bankrolled by Mercedes-Benz,
Schumacher managed to convince
Jordan that he had raced the track
many times, in fact he’d only ever
been around the circuit once, on
a bicycle. It didn’t matter. In the
qualifying for his first race he mas-
tered the much feared Eau Rouge
corner, and parked the Jordan 7th
on the starting grid, outperforming
his much more experienced team
mate and shaking up the F1 estab-
lishment. In the subsequent race
he failed to finish after the clutch
blew itself to pieces on the run up
to the first corner, in the meantime
Formula 1 had already sat up and
taken notice. By the Italian GP two
weeks later, he’d been snapped up
by Benetton, thus began the epic
rise of Michael Schumacher.
Within a year he’d wrapped up his
first win, at the very circuit he’d be-
gun his career, and went on to win
three more in 1993 in an inferior car
to the likes of Ayrton Senna, Alain
Prost and Nigel Mansell. His early
career had already marked him
out as the obvious successor to the
great Ayrton Senna, and Formula
1 was set for a thrilling battle be-
tween two of the most gifted driv-
ers in its history. Then came the
San Marino GP at Imola, in 1994, a
weekend which many in the sport
call the darkest weekend in the
history of Formula 1. In qualifying
for the race, Roland Ratzenberg-
er’s car hit the wall, instantly kill-
ing him. In the race, Schumacher
the young pretender was chasing
the leading Ayrton Senna. Into the
fast sweeping Tamburello corner,
Senna’s car bottomed out, hit the
wall and he was killed when a sus-
pension wishbone hit him on the
head. Schumacher went on to win
the championship that year, after
a clash with Damon Hill at the last
race of the season. His perform-
ance at the Spanish GP went down
as one of his best: coming home
second despite being limited to 5th
gear for the majority of the race.
Benetton’s momentum grew and
Schumacher’s ability to rally the
team behind him saw the teams
aquisition of the 1995 championship
double. As all of this was happening,
a middle of the grid ran team called
Ferrari was watching on. Ferrari,
although a legendary name in mo-
tor racing, had been struggling
on track for almost 20 years. After
the death of old man Commenda-
tore Enzo Ferrari in 1989, the team
and company as a whole went into
a freefall dive. Rumour has it that
Ferrari approached Schumacher’s
manager, Willi Weber, to sign him
for them. He laughed, and jokingly
said “give us a blank cheque and
he will sign for you”. Ferrari was
not bluffung and did just that. In
1996, Schumacher came onto the
track in red overalls. His transfer
would help revive the most his-
toric team in motor racing to be-
Schumacher: is this the
end of a racing legend?

Michael Schumacher in Red, post-Benetton. This jolly grin masks the fact that you will never be able to
drive as fast or as well as him. But since he is retiring now, maybe you’ve got a chance and should give
it a go if you can manage to pick up a few sponsors. Otherwise, put this picture on your wall and tell
yourself there will never be anyone as good as Schumacher ever again, and try not to get misty-eyed
