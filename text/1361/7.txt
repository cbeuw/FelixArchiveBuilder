This week’s business news
■ Shares in the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China will
begin trading this Friday in what
is likely to be the world’s largest
ever IPO. The flotation of ICBC,
China’s biggest lender, gener-
ated huge interest last week, with
orders for the 5% portion of the
shares allocated to retail inves-
tors 49 times over subscribed in
Shanghai. Such interest is likely
to see the shares priced at the
top of the proposed range of
$0.33–$0.39.
With the IPO split between the
Hong Kong and Shanghai mar-
kets, ICBC stands to raise up to
$16bn in Hong Kong and $5.8bn
on the mainland, trumping the
$18.4bn float of NTT DoCoMo
in 1998. These figures assume
greenshoes (the ability to is-
sue more shares than initially
planned in case of heavy demand)
will be exercised. The success of
the offering was due in part to
investors’ desire to access the
booming Chinese economy, with
risk reduced due to the Chinese
government’s backing of ICBC.
The company has also done much
recently to reduce a soaring non-
performing loan ratio with a re-
structuring that has made the
bank competitive.
Europe’s impending pension crisis
Old people are getting older, with
the average person living to be 76,
five years longer than was in the
1960s. The reasons: people have
better lifestyles, better healthcare
and new medicines. Worryingly,
whilst the old are multiplying, the
young are not. This is amplified by
the baby boomers, born after the
Second World War, who are now
reaching retirement age. Exacer-
bated by the low birth-rate of 1.47
children per woman, European
populations are getting smaller. All
this combined is changing the pop-
ulation distribution from a pyramid
to a more top-heavy shape. By the
year 2050, the year I am due to start
receiving my state pension, there
will only be 2 adults per person over
the age of 65.
The retirement age in the UK
is currently 65 for men, and 60 for
women. However this is going to
start to rise with the retirement age
for women reaching 65 by the year
2020. In most EU countries, people
depend on state pensions when
they retire. With the state pension
in the UK being under £100 a week,
it makes for quite a meagre living.
The government is encouraging
people to put money in to their own
pension schemes.
It is not just state pensions which
are in trouble. Last month, Dav-
id Norgrove, from the Pensions
Regulator, expressed his concerns
about companies underestimat-
ing the length of time people will
be withdrawing from their pension
schemes. With each year life ex-
pectancy increases, there is in an
increase of 4% to pension scheme
liabilities. This is becoming a very
real and very expensive problem
for companies and could spell dis-
aster to any who underestimate it.
As it is linked to the stock market,
if the economy was to slow down
companies may not be able to pro-
vide the pensions they said they
would. Their mistakes could end up
costing us in higher rates or lower
pay out rates once we have retired.
The elderly want to help combat
the pension crisis. Some have been

forced to retire, whilst others would
enjoy a part time job for a little ex-
tra money and to keep them men-
tally sharp.
Some employers frown upon hir-
ingtheseveryexperiencedworkers.
They can be seen as having a very
short shelf life and some bosses do
not like the idea of having someone
more experienced and possibly
more qualified working below them.
Many of the older generations are
returning to work, though. There
has been a big increase in part time
work for the elderly in places such
as supermarkets who utilise the
older generations experience and
excellent people skills.
■ Markets have remained buoyant
despite mounting evidence that the
US economy is heading for a “hard
landing”. It is increasingly likely
that the Federal Reserve will keep
rates at 5.25%, rather than making
the economy-boosting cut that had
been hoped for. Despite this, falling
oil prices have seen the FTSE 100
retain ground and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average break 12,000 for
the first time.
■ Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel-
maker, confirmed it accepted a
£5.1bn takeover bid from India’s
Tata Steel, in a deal that would cre-
ate the world’s sixth-largest steel
producer. Corus and Tata Steel have
agreed a cash offer, valuing Corus
at 455p per share, which will be put
to shareholders over the coming
months. The Tata-Corus deal would
be India’s largest foreign takeover,
reinstating Asia’s current strength
in the steel industry.
The deal, which includes an equi-
ty value of £4.1bn and around £1bn
in debt, was not received well by
Standard Life, one of Corus’ larg-
est shareholders. The investment
company, who own a 7.9 per cent
stake, says the deal undervalues
Corus, and has not yet commented
on whether or not they will accept
Tata’s offer. The deal maintains the
trend of rapid consolidation within
the steel sector, the most recently
publicised being the £18.1bn takeo-
ver of Arcelor by Mittal Steel (an-
other Indian steel maker) in June
this year.
■ Toshiba, the Japanese industrial
giant, is to sue Sony for damages
to its brand image after the recall
of about 830,000 of its laptops that
contain Sony’s allegedly dangerous
lithium-ion batteries.
The batteries, which have re-
portedly overheated and burst into
flame, have been installed in laptops
of several different manufacturers,
leading to a global recall of about
8 million Sony batteries, with US
market leaders Dell and Apple re-
calling 6 million batteries between
them. Sony last week announced a
huge revision to its operating prof-
its forecast for the full year.
The battery recall is expected to
cost Sony up to £180 million, based
only on the cost of replacing the
faulty batteries, and not including
the potentially huge compensation
costs if legal action is carried out
against them. Sony reported that
operating profits would be 62 per
cent below its previous forecast, at
Y50bn rather than Y130bn, despite
an unchanged revenue forecast of
Y8,230bn. The situation has been
exacerbated by recent problems
in its games division. Sony’s huge
investment in its much hyped Play-
Station 3 has yet to be realised as a
result of launch delays and a reduc-
tion in price and initial shipments.
■ David Cameron and Gordon
Brown have sought to win the sup-
port of the City in their pledges for
the premiership. In a meeting with
leading City figures Mr Brown pro-
posed a significant review of the tax
system aimed at reducing regula-
tion by “at least 25 per cent”. Mr
Cameron’s Conservative Party pub-
lished a review that also recognised
the need for simplification of taxes
and further recommended a cut in
corporation tax, from 30 to 25 per
cent, and the abolition of stamp
duty on share transactions. Cur-
rently at a rate of 0.5 per cent,
there have been increasing calls
from the financial sector to scrap
this tax, an issue that Mr Brown
has as yet failed to address.
These proposed measures aim to
keep the City an attractive place
to do business. By changing the
tax regime, London will hope to
remain competitive with global
financial centres.

The government has recognised
this want of pensioners and as of the
1st of October, new age discrimina-
tion laws have come in to affect. It is
now illegal to discriminate against
someone because of their age if
they are under 65 and people over
65 need to be given 6 months notice
when an employer wants them to
retire. This, in theory, should help
to get the elderly out of retirement,
not only meaning they do not need
the support of the government and
living a better life, but paying taxes
to help support others.
The government recognises what
a big problem the pension crisis
could become and has set out a list
of proposals in a white paper ear-
lier this year, based on the recom-
mendations of Lord Turner. It has
been set out that the retirement
age is going to be raised gradually
from the year 2024, so that by 2048
the minimum age for withdrawing
a state pension is 68. The govern-
ment also wants to introduce a Na-
tional Pension Scheme in the year
2012. 4% of a person’s salary will be
paid in to the scheme, with the em-
ployer paying an additional 3% and
the government 1% into it. The gov-
ernment is hoping that the National
Pension Scheme will counteract
any fall in state pensions caused
by the growing size of the older
generations.
There are some people out there
that believe there is, and will be, no
pension crisis. It is thought amongst
some that the change in ratio of
young to old will be offset by the
increase of productivity. Further to
this, immigration is increasing and
will continue to increase, with the
acceptance of Bulgaria and Roma-
nia in to the EU. These immigrants
provide needed relief to the work
force, helping to bolster the work-
ing force, supporting the elderly.
Undoubtedly we will have to con-
tinue working to an older age than
our parents. If we want a reason-
able standard of living, so we can
enjoy our twighlight years, we have
to expect to either pay higher taxes
or make contributions into a pen-
sion scheme almost as soon as we
graduate from our courses, and
make it a priority.
By 2050, the rising proportion of elderly people means that there will be only two adults per pensioner
