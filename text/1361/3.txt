HSBC pushes student over the edge
A 20 year old Computer Studies
student from South Wales commit-
ted suicide after his bank hounded
him to pay off his £1,200 overdraft.
Geraint Banks-Wilkinson, from
Nant-y-moel, studied at Swansea
Institute and was described as an
“award-winning student”.
Mr. Banks-Wilkinson supported
his studies with a part-time job at
McDonalds, an overdraft and a
small student loan. In December
2005 HSBC began to phone Mr.
Banks-Wilkinson almost every day
pressurising him to pay off his over-
draft. His parents later said: “He
was not afraid of a bit of work and
was doing his studies as well, but
could not do everything. The way
they treated him was appalling.
They were hounding us when they
could not get hold of him.”
Whilst taking his GCSE exams Mr.
Banks-Wilkinson had self-harmed
and had a history of depression. He
had also been prescribed anti-de-
pression medication.
The pressure mounted and cli-
maxed at Christmas when a £1000
student loan was paid into his ac-
count, paying off most of his £1,200
overdraft. HSBC then cancelled
his overdraft facility leaving him
with no student loan and no ac-
cess to any money. Distraught, Mr.
Banks-Wilkinson was driven to the
Bridgend branch of HSBC on 11th
January by his mother. He returned
in a state of extreme distress. Mrs.
Banks-Wilkinson recalled: “He said
‘They can’t help me’. When he came
back, basically he sat in the car, put
his head in his hands and sobbed.”
Mrs. Banks-Wilkinson tried to
pacify her son over a cup of tea, ad-
vised him to try other banks or to
contact HSBC by another means.
He was appeared to cheer up and
returned to Swansea in order to re-
turn to work at McDonalds.
The next day he went to work as
usual and socialised with work col-
leagues after the shift was over.
However, Mr. Banks-Wilkinson was
found hanging from the ceiling in
his bathroom the following day.
A final, bitter irony came as HSBC
tried to phone Mr. Banks-Wilkin-
son’s father on the day his son died:
“On the day he died, they even
called and I told them exactly what
had happened. I said: ‘You have
pestered him for months and now
you have driven him to his death. I
hold you responsible’.”
Philip Rogers, the coroner, re-
corded a verdict of suicide after
a post-mortem exam showed the
cause of death was by hanging.
HSBC offered the following state-
ment concerning the tradgedy:
“HSBC again offers its sincere con-
dolences to the family and friends
of Geraint Banks-Wilkinson. HSBC
has not as yet had an opportunity to
review the coroner’s findings and
as such cannot comment on them
specifically. Further, privacy legisla-
tion prohibits a bank from discuss-
ing the details of its customers’ ac-
counts, and we certainly would not
want to intrude upon the family’s
grief.” A spokesman for the com-
pany also said: “At HSBC we make
every possible effort to reach cus-
tomers the moment we begin to see
signs of financial difficulty, not to do
so would be irresponsible.”
Since the tragic suicide of Ge-
raint Banks-Wilkinson, a number
of HSBC customers who have had
similar experiences have come for-
ward. One student was reportedly
left with £30 to last until the end
of term because his overdraft was
cancelled. Jamie Marshall, who
studied at Reading University, said:
“I went over my overdraft limit and
cleared it by paying in all of my stu-
dent loan and wages from my job.
HSBC cancelled my overdraft, leav-
ing me with £30 for the term. For a
month, I ate one meal of beans on
toast a day.” Another student, Aar-
on Robinson claimed to have been
targeted by HSBC after he gradu-
ated. He said: “Roughly every two
hours a person would call demand-
ing I pay off my £2000 overdraft in
full or face serious repercussions.
They then rang my parents from
6:30am to as late as 10:30pm.”
An HSBC spokesman comment-
ed: “I don’t see multiple calls as
badgering people. It’s trying to get
a message to someone in financial
difficulty.”
Whatever the reasons, whoever is
to blame, one thing is clear. Despite
high street banks bending over
backwards to attract new student
customers, the incentives do not
mean the banks will offer any sort
of support, or display any kind of
understanding of a student’s situa-
tion. Banking is a hard-nosed busi-
ness and a successful bank will al-
ways defend its interests.
On the other hand, many students
find it find it difficult to pay the large
tuition fees and support themselves
whilst studying, since they may not
have much time to work. This con-
flict can have disasterous effects
and is likely to get worse with the
introduction of student top up fees,
putting students under a debt larg-
er obligation.
The likely effect is that the pres-
sure created on students from less
affluent backgrounds may grow
to much for studying at university
to be a viable career option. And
since graduates earn much more
than non-graduates, the rich-poor
divide could widen. That point
couuld not be more clear than to
the friends and family of Geraint
Banks-Wilkinson.

Boris to tackle Uni cheats
Boris Johnson, the shadow edu-
cation minister has said that ex-
ams, instead of months of course-
work, would help prevent students
cheating.
Coventry University recently
caught 237 students who had bro-
ken their rule concerning course-
work. Seven have been expelled
and another twelve cases are being
looked at. Nottingham University
have disciplined 53 students for the
same reason, but only one has been
expelled.
The main method of cheating is
by ‘cutting and pasting’ coursework
from the Internet. Some websites
are selling essays for up to £1000.
Baroness Ruth Deech, the stu-
dent complaints ombudsman, said:
“Education is a quest, a voyage of
discovery weighing up a range of
views and encouragement of no-
tions. The intellectual tradition of
inquiry is getting lost. If lecturers
can imbue students of the notion
that they are searching rather than
copying, we maybe can go some
way to tackling plagiarism.”
The Daily Mail claims that up to
20,000 university students were
caught cheating last year. Boris
Johnson also said that the alleged
10% of students who cheated were
“a minority driven to extremes”.
He also described the website
UKEssays, which sells essays to
students, as “queasy-making in its
efficiency”.
Meanwhile, Wes Streeting, the ed-
ucation vice-president for the NUS
claimed the high level of students
working part-time was putting
them under pressure. He also at-
tacked some universities for hav-
ing “adopted a heavy hand and…
throwing students off courses.”
Another popular way for cheat-
ers is to use technology. Typically a
student would photograph a ques-
tion and MMS the picture to a col-
league outside the exam hall, who
then sends back the answer. The
problem has got so bad that one
Government expert is calling for
exam rooms to be ‘shielded’ from
mobile phone signals using a ‘Far-
aday cage’. The device would act
similarly to the way elevators act in
blocking mobile phone signals.
Plagiarisers should be wary; Uni-
versities UK say that 80% of institu-
tions are now using the electronic
software ‘Turnitin’ to catch the
cheats.
Boris Johnson moments before tackling German No. 6 Maurizio
Gaudino; if that’s anything to go by then cheaters should watch out
No C in the K&C!
The Congestion Charge is to be
rolled out over a large section of
Kensington and Chelsea. The plans
have been contested in the area,
but the efforts of campaigners ap-
pears to have failed. The existing
zone, which borders Park Lane,
will be swept out to the Earl’s Court
Road one-way system.
The plans have come under intense
criticism since the RAC revealed
that the most congested roads lay
to the north, south and east of the
centre, rather than to the west.
This has led many to question Ken
Livingstone’s motives. Some be-
lieve he is trying to raise income by
effectively introducing a tax on the
residents that live in West London.
Edmund King, executive direc-
tor of the RAC Foundation, said:
“There is no possible logic for sin-
gling out west London for this pro-
posed extension. There are many
other areas that are far more con-
gested. Many key routes that cross
the proposed new charging zone
have very little congestion at all. Of
course King’s Road gets busy but
that is a sign of a vibrant shopping
and entertainment culture. Expe-
rience tends to suggest this latest
scheme is all about revenue rais-
ing, not combating congestion.” Jo
Valentine of London First said busi-
nesses were frustrated at the May-
or’s “unwillingness to... address
problems with congestion hotspots,
none of which are in the proposed
extension.”
A document released by the
Royal Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea points out that not all the
residents of the borough are afflu-
ent; some areas in the borough are
the most deprived in England. The
areas of St. Charles and Golbourne
have about 23,000 residents, 60% of
whom live in social housing. Under
the proposed plans, these residents
would not qualify for the reduced
tariff, but would not be able to effec-
tively use their car without paying
in full.
