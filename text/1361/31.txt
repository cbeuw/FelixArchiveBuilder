From the huge pile of no complet-
ed grids received a fortnight ago,
it seems my last crossword was a
little too hard.
Anyone might think that this was
because I made a mistake in the
clue to 17 across, but I like to think
you are clever enough to spot that,
so perhaps it has more to do with
the lack of a prize.
In response, there is now a prize
fund of ten whole pounds. Per
week. It might not be the national
lottery, but the odds are better.
Regardless, this week’s should
be easier, and there is even a bit of
a two-pronged theme to some of
the clues. Enjoy. Please.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
So, this week you
think you’re a funny
fucker do you? Well,
if that’s the case:
send your version of
the horoscopes into
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk and
if our stars align with your arse-
hole those words might gravitate
towards this here page.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
Preheat oven to 180C.
Beat one egg into
a pint of milk. Add
dash of brandy. Trim
crusts off eight slices
of slightly stale bread
and cut into squares. Butter this
bread on one side. Layer bread and
sultanas alternately. Pour in milk
mixture. Cook for 35 minutes. Yum.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
As you make your
way down Kensington
High Street, a young
chavette shrieks
“Come an’ ‘ave a go if
ya fink ya ‘ard ‘nuff”.
Fortunately, you just bought a dic-
tionary in Waterstones. Ramming
said book so far up the bling queen,
her colon ruptures. She dies.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
You grow a fetish for
bum cleavage, male
or female regardless.
Daringly, you poke
your index finger
down the pants/knick-
ers/g-string of anything you can
get your mitts near. Unfortunately
the builder you attempt your trick
on objects and sets you in cement.
This Week’s Horoscopes
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
Nine down, three to
go. Or should that be
two to go? I can never
decide. It’s like when
I was sitting on the
tube the other day and
a lady told her kid: “five stops to
go”. I couldn’t work it out. Glouces-
ter Road or South Ken? Current
stop inclusive or not? Dear oh dear.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
OBJECTION!
Duh-duh-doodle-
dooo-dur-dur-nur-
nur-nur-nur-naaa!
Congratulations,
you’ve just fired up
your new Japanese import copy
of Phoenix Wright 2: Justice For
All, English subtitles included. You
may have a jaffa cake.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
This week you
discover that your boy-
friend has ordered an
assassination attempt
on your life. Reading
his text messages, you
find out that it will take place out-
side the Blackett Lab. Sussed, you
think. But a fire drill causes you to
be funnelled into firing line. Bang.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Eating an apple, you
notice you are becom-
ing increasingly full.
After hours, the fruit
has swollen to an epic
size. A hatch opens
and a pip skewers you with it’s
sweet, sickly semen insertion stick.
You are harvested for Morrison’s.
Morrison’s... Must try harder.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
Blimey, first there was
copulating Cancer
last week, but look at
this folks: is that Libra
symbol akin to a revo-
lutionary new TIE
fighter from Star Wars Episode
VII? Oops, I mentioned number 7. I
can hear hordes of hot headed Leia
lovers coming to hunt me down.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
This week you meet
H from Steps whilst
perusing the camels
section of the Soho
Video-For-Hire. He
comes across you
really nicely and you introduce
him to your mates. After a good old
knees up at DaVinci’s you all agree
he got such an unjust bad press.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
Titties. Titties. Titties.
Parp! Parp! Tit-
ties. Titties. Titties.
Titttttttttttttties.
Parrrrrrrrrrp!! Titties.
Pa-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-rp!
Titties! Titties! Titties! Titties!
Titties! Titties! Parp. Parp. Parp!
P
.A.R.P! Titties. Parp! Titties! Tit-
ties! Titties! Titties. Parp! Titties!
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
In this week’s tale
from Felix Dungeons,
Andy doesn’t know
but we’re putting him
on the front page!
Myself and Alex are
his bitches and whilst he gradu-
ates or some shit like that, we’re
in charge! Here he comes! Quick! I
must return to my world of leather.
