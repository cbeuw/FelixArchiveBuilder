In the small town of Mirpur north
of the capital Dhaka, famous for its
mango trees, homemade bombs
killed over 20 people. In Kansant, a
small village, hundreds fought with
police, and 7 were killed. In the sub-
urb of Dhaka, thousands took to the
streets in protest; a local MP was
violently wounded. Over 500 people
have been injured in such riots in
the last two months. The Bangal-
deshi people are fighting for their
right to a reliable source of energy.
Over 18 power plants are current-
ly shut down for repair and mainte-
nance and the countries generating
capacity is barely reaching half of
the current demand. The challeng-
es of numerous blackouts, some-
times lasting several hours a day,
have been particularly strenuous
during the holy month of Ramadan
which sees people fast in extreme
heat. The lack of electricity for even
cooling fans has pushed the masses
to breaking point.
The energy crisis is not the only
challenge that Bangladesh is fac-
ing; its water and transport infra-
structure has been found lacking,
24 percent of the population are liv-
ing under extreme income poverty
and the country is in serious politi-
cal turmoil. Over the last year we
have witnessed an average of one
mass strike per week. It is this web
of intrinsically connected obstacles
that has made solving the energy
crisis an altogether monumental
challenge, one that several energy
ministers have tried to take on
but have resigned promptly after
appointment.

Bangladesh: the fight for energy
According to the College’s Energy
and Environmental Services web-
site, energy management and envi-
ronmental services on campus are
key issues to Estates. Imperial Col-
lege Estates promises to provide
up-to-date information about its en-
ergy and environmental perform-
ance and its initiatives to reduce
environmental impacts and reduce
energy costs and consumption.
All of this sounds perfectly rea-
sonable and for anyone who doesn’t
know better the College is probably
keeping to its promises. However,
if you take a moment to investigate
the topic you will find that the Col-
lege’s ‘up-to-date’ information is in-
significant at best.
According the Energy Manage-
ment Policy website, “Imperial
College is a world-class teaching
and research institution providing
scientific and technical excellence,
innovation and solutions for the glo-
bal needs of the 21st century. Best
practice in energy management
will become increasingly important
in support of this position.”
However, this spirit is rather
contradictory to the website infor-
mation, which doesn’t include the
energy policy itself. Worse still,
some of the web links, for example
the College’s Carbon Management
Programme, have expired.

ladesh has been seen to suffer from
variable voltages, poor operating
efficiencies, significant load shed-
ding and poor tariff and billing pro-
cedures. All review indicators have
been towards a lack of investment
in the country’s power genera-
tion infrastructure. With expected
demand to increase by 60% in the
next 6 years it is expected that an
investment of over 10 billion pounds
is needed by 2011 to reach a target
of reliable energy by 2020. It is a
sum so large that the government
has little choice but to look towards
international donors and private in-
vestors to replenish the countries
power infrastructure.
But Bangladesh isn’t the easiest
place to invest, with alleged issues
of corruption, beauracracy and
misinformation all plaguing the
government. Whilst Chinese com-
panies have been seen to finance
and implement projects success-
fully, such as a recent 100 million
dollar transmission refurbishment
project, others have been with-
drawing investments, including
the Indian company Tata. However,
investors don’t seem to be coming
out with flying colours either; they
have often accused of exploiting the
nations resources. The American
company Occidental had a major
pipeline explosion in 1997 and the
matter of compensation for environ-
mental damage has still not been
resolved, and a similar case exists
for the Canadian company Niko Re-
sources as well. Asia Energy PLC
have looked to initiate an open pit
coal project which displaces over
40,000 people over the next 10 years
which has caused much anger from
local village communities. There is
an uncertain and potentially violent
future for the Bangladeshi people;

and there seems to be a lack of so-
lutions being delivered. The govern-
ment has set in place several short
term measures, including enforced
black outs for ‘unimportant’ indus-
tries, which are seemingly frustrat-
ing the situation further. It is ironic
that a country with rich natural gas
is unable to meet its own power re-
quirements due to ultimately a lack
of good governance and profes-
sional technical and management
human resources who are able to
deliver solutions in these difficult
social conditions.
The world should perhaps take
a serious note of violent repercus-
sions of energy shortages that we
are witnessing in Bangladesh, for a
similar situation may not be too far
for others, the UK included.

Furthermore, for a College which
embraces the idea of environmen-
tal protection, the College is not
doing so well by not funding the
Union’s sustainable redevelopment
initiative.
The only section of the website
which is relatively up-to-date is
that on recycling – which provides
information on the College’s five
phase programme on implement-
ing and managing recycling on the
the power which students and staff
have in influencing the College’s
actions. The second annual Green
Week – which is expected to take
place at the end of February 2007
– will focus on reviewing the Col-
lege’s energy use and demand that
it take action towards cutting its
carbon emissions.
For a “world-class teaching and
research institute” the College lets
itself down by not making use of its
own technology. With the majority of
our energy currently being bought
from the expensive electrical grid it
would seem not only economic and
environmentally friendly, but also
extremely advantageous from a
PR perspective that we implement
the technology developed by our re-
searchers on our own campus.
Further to this, Estates should
not only provide up-to-date infor-
mation on its developments, which
it doesn’t appear to be doing very
well, but it should actively dis-
seminate such information. As a
result, Green Week will aim at fur-
ther increasing the communication
between Estates and the people
whom it serves, the College’s stu-
dents and staff.

of the website was updated earlier
