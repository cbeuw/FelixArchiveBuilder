I awake at 1500m, in a hut on the
slope of mountain Migovec in Slove-
nia, to the sight of a cup of coffee be-
ing waved in my general direction.
The caving club has been exploring
the deep caves of this mountain in
conjunction with the local club for
over a decade. The main cave sys-
tem is over eleven kilometres long,
and nearly a thousand metres deep.
Our hope for today was to enter a
more recently discovered cave –
‘Primadona’, and explore in the di-
rection of this main system – barely
a hundred metres away. Combined,
these caves would be the longest
cave in Slovenia that can be ex-
plored without diving equipment.
Setting off for the peak high above
we are accompanied along the
steep path by the roar of a river
in the deep valley to our side, the
stark peaks of the next mountain
range jutting purposefully from the
white cloud that rolled below our
feet. At the cave entrance we check
and stow all our gear carefully – one
forgotten item would spell a prema-
ture and disappointing end to the
trip.
The entrance is an enormous
slope of permanent snow, a fast to-
boggan ride in a plastic oversuit! A
quick crawl and a wander along a
passageway, to reach the first rope.
Down we shoot, zipping through
the inky blackness. Kept company
by the click of the karabiners onto
rope, and the clunk of the boulders
beneath the feet, forever chasing
the headlight in front, the calls of
‘Rope Free!’ and ‘OK!’ merging into
soporific mumbles over the echo.
Today I am in luck – the Slovenian at
the front of our advance party sings
bass in a choir. Soon the chambers
are resounding to his sonorous ren-
ditions – Slovenian folk songs inter-
spersed with Leonard Cohen.
Abseiling down through a chim-
ney between the rock, the walls
suddenly disappear. Looking down
far below, I can see pinpricks of
light – the headlamps of the rest
of the party waiting for me. I reach
a reattachment point in the rope,
where I need to take my abseil
device off one section of rope and
reattach it beyond the rock anchor.
Before I joined the caving club,
the very idea of doing such a ma-
noeuvre would have filled me with
dread. The drop is not just enough
to guarantee a certain death, but
would allow plenty of time for con-
templation before hitting the rock.
However, I now know that I am safe
in my harness and am perfectly at
ease, my actions totally automatic
as I attach multiple safety cords,
transfer my weight over and tested
my descending device before tak-
ing out the last safety.
Free once more, with absolutely
no effort I gently drift down. Ab-
Exploring the deep
caves of Slovenia
Jarvist Frost seiling down into this bell-jar I am
left dangling in free space; the thin
white line of the rope disappear-
ing beyond my light’s illumination
above. The knit of the rope sheath
started me gently spinning – I don’t
even have to turn my head to watch
the chamber go by, to see the wa-
terfall across the way develop from
a drippy purr into an almighty roar.
An energetic scramble up a slope
of boulders got me to my compan-
ions, sitting on insulating coils of
rope in a side chamber away from
the damp and the draft of the falling
water. Cravings for chocolate and
nicotine were indulged by the vari-
ous cavers, ice-cold drinking water
collected from a nearby rock pool.
How deep were we now? Still very
shallow – not much more than two
hundred metres. So – only deeper
than Canary Wharf is high!
We then undulate along, scram-
bling over enormous house-sized
chunks of limestone, ducking
through rock archways and stomp-
ing along tube-tunnel-sized pas-
sageways. At the limit of explora-
tion, we unpack and prepare to
climb. Hours of work are spent
gaining a precious ten metres of
height through the roof of the corri-
dor. Finally up, we had entered the
unknown.
A little chamber with a clamber up
into a crawlspace. No one has ever
seen this passage, and we have no
idea where it goes. This bit of cave
was very old indeed, having formed
when this part of the mountain was
below the water table, before the
kilometre-deep valleys formed on
either side. As the last of the water
drained out, it left behind amazing
formations in the rock and the mud,
some of which inevitably were illu-
minated, admired and then crushed
underfoot.
Some rather acrobatic manoeu-
vres later, and the passage starts
getting much bigger. Drawn on by
the sound of a waterfall, we clam-
ber down increasingly large climbs
onto an enormous rock shelf. The
main drop was too far for the short
rope that we have, though looking
carefully over the edge, one can see
a little underground river running
past far below. Placing rock-an-
chors on the very end of the ledge
and bouncing sideways as we abseil
down, one could reach a false floor
just within the length of our rope.
Safely down, we walk around the
corner to be confronted with a clear
sign that someone had been here
before – a neat cairn of rocks placed
on a boulder in the middle of the
passageway, marking the location of
a survey station. But in which cave
are we now? We had certainly trav-
elled a sufficient distance to reach
the main system, but the path had
so many twists that we have no way
of telling our overall direction. Ex-
citing stuff indeed!
We split up and scramble around,
looking for another station – hope-
fully one with a little note on wa-
terproof paper stating which part
of the survey it was, and therefore
which cave. This part of the cave
was an absolute rabbit warren, with
extinct waterfalls and passage-
ways criss-crossing and spiralling
around each other. Like some Es-
cher drawing, you can step across
a chasm and look down to see an-
other team member crawling along
sideways below you, while another
caver traversed along high above.
Time was passing, and it was
many hours of effort to reach the
surface. Half the team started sur-
veying the way back, slowly taking
point-to-point compass, clinometer
and distance measurements for
feeding into a computer once back
in the nearby town. The rest of us
continue to explore. Climbing down
with the other English ICCC caver,
we found a route which doubles
back under the way that we have
come, shuffling along an increas-
ingly wide gorge. Looking down is
terrifying indeed – the roaring river
being very far below, but the climb-
ing was easy, along wide mantel-
pieces of limestone. Back in a cor-
ridor-like passage we explore with
dawning realisation – to be sud-
denly confronted with the sight of
our original rope disappearing into
the ceiling! This bit of cave simply
reconnects to itself in a loop.
So we had failed to make the big
breakthrough, on that trip at least.
But no one has ever been down
to that underground river – all it
requires is more rope and more
time. We finish the survey, tidy up
the ropes and start back towards
the surface, saying goodbye to the
dangling bats as we go. Climbing
vertically into the heavens, I am
having the workout of my life – and
in the most awesome surroundings
rather than a stuffy London gym.
Finally at the entrance, we scram-
ble up the snow slope towards
the stars beyond – eleven hours
underground.
Back at the hut, a flood of warmth
and pine smoke flows from the door
into the icy night. You can always
squeeze another caver around a
table; bowls of hot soup and hunks
of bread magically appear, followed
by cake and a wee dram here and
there. Sitting around me are the
faces that go along with the motes
of light in the dark, people who I
had barely met when going under-
ground now seem like old friends,
united by the joy of cooperative
exploration and the shared experi-
ence underground.
The chatter runs late into the
night – where next to explore? And
what was the cave going to do next?
Where did that underground river
run to? And where from? The win-
ter snows will soon set in, it will be
during the ICCC expedition next
summer that we will be back at
the pushing front. Simply join the
club, let us teach you the necessary
skills by practicing in caves across
the most picturesque regions of the
country and you can walk alongside
us into the unknown.
The slope is

passage. We
have no idea
where it goes
