Redesigned Chanel 2.55
Bag
The beautiful revised edi-
tion on the classic 1955
quilted bag.
If you don’t happen to
have £450 or so to spend
on a bag (you filthy peas-
ants) then buy a vintage
rip-off. You can find bags
inspired by the Chanel
bag on Ebay, or from
Absolute Vintage (15
Hanbury St., E1 6QR).
Vans
Guys look hot in Vans,
but try to avoid the cliche
checker pattern. Girls
look great in Vans, unless
you have big feet. Vans
on big feet look like flip-
pers. Effectively, you’d
look like a manatee.
Skulls
Um yeah, Urban Outfit-
ter and Topshop, tween
goth is not a good look. If
you go for the goth look
do it in a sort of brooding
romantic way. That look
does not feature cartoon
skulls.
Volume
You can use this as a test
to see if a person is just
following fashion slavish-
ly or if they actually have
some sense of style.
No one looks good in this
shit. Not even models.
Not even naturally slen-
der models with anorexia
and exercise bulimia. Al-
though most things don’t
look good on a skeleton.
Kate Moss
Not herself so much,
more the continuing
slavish devotion to her
despite her decline in
style.
The first designer label, Worth, orig-
inated in Paris at the end of the 19th
century. Charles Fedrick Worth was
the first dressmaker who, instead of
copying the popular designs of the
day from illustrated journals, would
impose his own taste on women.
He was also the first designer to
throw a fashion show, using attrac-
tive young women as “sosies”, ef-
fectively inventing the model. He
would dress woman popular in high
society to create a buzz about his
designs, much in the same way de-
signers today give the latest it-bag
to the latest it-celebrity.
But are high fashion labels like
Dolce & Gabbana, Yves Saint Lau-
rent and so relevant any more?
Trends move so fast these days that
high street stores have the upper
hand in staying ahead of the trends.
People don’t want clothes that last
a lifetime; they buy clothes that are
fashionable for the season.
Are people even being inspired
by designer catwalks? Especially
in this media-saturated age, peo-
ple can get their inspiration eve-
rywhere. The internet means that
we don’t need designers to travel
across the world to find the latest
look. People don’t need catwalks to
dictate their look. Unless, of course,
you’re Victoria Beckham, who cop-
ies entire outfits from the catwalk:
what a style icon. The latest trends,
leggings for example, have come
from “the street”.
Even if designer stores aren’t as
quick to move as the high street, are
the clothes at least of a better quali-
ty? Or the designers any better? It’s
scandalous that Ralph Lauren can
charge £50 for a plain white vest
top while an identical high street
version is a fraction of the price. A
lot of the time high street and high
fashion labels even share the same
factory. It’s sewing on the designer
label that costs the extra £40.
It’s doubtful that designer labels
represent the cream of the world's
creativity. If you really want a great
design, high fashion labels are the
last place to go. For something of
higher quality than the usual high-
street fare, it would be smarter to
head to a boutique that stocks a
range of lesser known labels. You
get a sense of exclusivity from the
fact that the brands are small, as
opposed to the sense of exclusiv-
ity from buying something that
the majority of the world can’t af-
ford. It’s pretty superficial to want
something that’s merely priced to
Designer or high street?
Are people shunning heavily advertised “high-fashion” labels, asks Sarah Skeete
be exclusive. That’s how you end
up with the nouveau rich from Rus-
sia dressed head to toe in designer
gear, yet only managing to look like
upper-class chavs. Money does
not buy style. Witness the decline
of Burberry once the distinctively-
patterned baseball caps were colo-
nised by chavs. Nobody wanted to
touch Burberry because the sense
of exclusivity had gone. This type
of branding, where the label is
worth more than the design, leads
to counterfeits flooding the market.
People seem to be moving further
away from the ostentatiousness of
heavily-branded goods, towards
clothing that subtly hints at better
taste.
Designer labels just don’t have
the same cache that they did in the
past. They brand you as a fashion
victim. Granted, their advertise-
ments are more seductive than
ever, but aren’t consumers smart
enough to separate the ads from
the brand? Those Calvin Klein jeans
look hot on a half-naked model, but
so would a pair from Oxfam. Peo-
ple understand that adverts aren’t
representative of the brand. Even if
the advertisements are quite crea-
tive, what does that say about the
brand? They’re created by an out-
side agency. Diesel’s adverts have
always been quite interesting. Their
first adverts, featuring the slogan,
“Diesel: For Successful Living,"
were intended to make fun of all the
improbable advertising promises of
the past. I think it’s an interesting
sell, but that doesn’t mean I have
any of their clothes hanging in my
closet. In fact in the past few years
the most successful jeans have
been boutique brands from New
York & California who haven’t spent
a dime on advertising; brands like
Paper Denim & Cloth, Seven and
Rock & Republic.
We’re lucky that here in Britain
we have a lot of choice between
high street and designer labels. It
really depends on what designer
labels represent to you. Luxury or
lack of style?
COOL
Burberry - these days it reminds us of chavs in baseball caps
Tongue-in-cheek Diesel advert, aping past advert styles; something of a West Side Story feel to it
Buy Calvin Klein jeans and people will half-nakedly grind on you LAME
