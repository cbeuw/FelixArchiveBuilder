One of the titles recommended by Chemical
Engineering Department was: Fluidised
Particles - Davidson & Harrison. However,
when it arrived the publishers, Univ Microfilms
International, had priced it at £32.00, which is
very expensive. After lengthy correspondence,
they have finally agreed that we can reduce the
price to £26.00. So for those of you who need a
copy, we now have it in stock.
