Recent newspaper articles have reported widespread dismissals of academic staff in Turkish
Universities by the military regime. Now two Turkish 'academics' are on a recruitment visit to
Britain.
BEWARE TURKS BEARING GIFTS
On February 19 two Turkish
academics arrived for a tour of
British Universities. One of these
gentlemen missed his appoint-
ment at Sussex U n i v e r s i t y
because his luggage had been
misdirected. Hardly the stuff to
get worked up about.
But a few days earlier on
February 16, tucked away in the
overseas news section of The
Guardian, a short news item
raised quite a few eyebrows:
About 220 university teachers
have now been dismissed as
part of an attempt to create a
strictly centralised university
system giving politically
'reliable' education.
Although the latest dis-
missals were carried out by
m a r t i a l law authorities,
university staff suspect that
the decisions of whom to
dismiss are taken by the all-
powerful High Education
Council set up by the mili-
tary....Most dismissed teach-
ers lose their pensions and
the right to teach or work in
the public service again. They
also find it hard to get a
passport.
Britain this week becomes
the first country to offer
hospitality to the new uni-
versity establishment in
Turkey when a dean from the
Middle East Technical Uni-
versity (METU) Dr Yahya
Tezel begins a two-week tour
of British universities as a
guest of the British Council.
The story eventually unfolded
despite the predictable fog of
official jargon and evasion. The
good doctors Kemal G u r u z
(specialist subject: energy and
coal technology) and Yahya
Tezel (former lefty and econo-
mist) would be on a British
Council sponsored jaunt of the
university circuit in Britain to
recruit British academics to
replace their purged counter-
parts in Turkey. They will soon
be knocking on the doors of
Imperial College ostensibly to
create 'closer links with M E T U
and I C and no doubt offer
lucrative jobs and contracts to
IC academic staff.
Now, if you approve of a
university system which turns all

whirlpool of international conflict and instability.'
academics into civil servants,
enforces a regulation banning
moustaches and beards and
reintroduces the equivalent of
school uniforms (see The Guard-
ian, 5/2/83), appoints university
vice-chancellors and sets out a
single national standard curri-
culum for all higher education,
please by all means catch the
next plane to Ankara or Istan-
bul. You will get roughly four
times the salary received by your
Turkish colleague (£250pm) who
may be just as well qualified as
you. Further perks include
lecture halls 'supervised' by
army officials (in case any young
undergraduate's concentration
wanders off), compulsory at-
tendance in lectures and a docile
student body, expected to learn
by rote and faithfully reproduce
the wisdom imparted by the
God-head lecturer. You will be
given powers whereby a stu-
dent's whole life and career
depend on the marks and
'confidential comments' which
will be passed on regularly from
you to the faculty dean. O f
course, you will need a 'security
clearance' yourself so stash away
those tell-tale C N D badges and
other evidence of subversion
such as The Guardian. But the
pin-stripe suit, a skinhead
haircut and a regulation shave
(no facial hair or side-boards)
should do the trick.
You may have seen London
double-deckers parading an
advertisement for people to take
their summer holidays in Tur-
key. It goes something like:
'Turkey: One Country, Two
Continents'. In truth is should
read 'one country, two contin-
ents—no democracy'. Since
September 1980 when the coun-
try was overrun by generals,
Turkey has been turned into one
big problem.
Despite Turkey's membership
in the European Council, N A T O
and associate links with the E E C
which link it with European
politics and institutions, the
military regime has dismantled
any semblance of democracy. As
a leader in that other notorious
subversive newspaper The
Financial Times commented, the
generals who run the country are
intent to shut Turkish society
inside a cage of tight bureau-
cratic controls. I n d i v i d u a l
liberties, freedom of the press,
trade union rights and the
democratic rights to assembly
and association have all been,
disposed of. Some 50.000 people
are in gaol and Amnesty Inter-
national has docrriL'nted 70
deaths in detention due to
torture.
The reason for the coup as
well as its aftermath are pain-
fully obvious. Always regarded
as the 'staunchest ally' of N A T O
and ingratiating itself into
American good books in return
for increased m i l i t a r y and
economic aid, the most impor-
tant thing about Turkey is where
it is. It is in a position of vital
strategic importance on the edge
of a frightening whirlpool of
international conflict and
instability. One quarter of all
hard surveillance of the USSR is
supplied by hundreds of U S
bases dotted around Turkey.
With the arrival of Reagan (and
the countdown to Armageddon)
the country has been packed
