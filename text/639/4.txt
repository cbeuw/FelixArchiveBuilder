Dear Sir
The cost of the Trident missile
system is £10,000,000,000 (ten
thousand million pounds), not
ten million pounds as printed in
the IC C N D Group article last
Friday. It is a huge amount of
money: enough to build over
500,000 new homes or double
the number of hospitals in
Britain.

Sick Pay
Dear Martin
Just a quick response to last
week's two letters on health
insurance. First of all, people in
head tenancies and student
houses have been charged for the
sick bay without being told what
they are paying for, having no
mention of it in their tenancy
agreements and without being
told that they are entitled to a
refund. As I said in my letter two
weeks ago, this could well be
illegal. It certainly isn't right. It
also appears that some people
who have already payed their
health insurance voluntarily in
previous years are now being
charged again.
Secondly M r Pyne says in his
letter that '....the U G C has
specifically stated such things (ie
sick bays) should not be funded
by College'. This is not true! The
U G C has not said any such
thing. If the aforesaid gentelman
can point out when, where and
in which document/communica-
tion this was put forward, then
the College finance section
would be glad to hear from him;
because they certainly haven't
seen it.
The sick bay provides, in the
words of Rebecca May (and I
agree) '....a vital part of the
services offered by the health
centre.' It should be kept open
and the finance withdrawn by
College reinstated. Once we start
accepting the principle that
students should be paying for
medical services, we end up with
things like the Lauwerys plan, in
which students will, if the plan is
carried out, be paying for Hall
maintenance, security guard
wages and a whole host of other
t h i n g s . The student grant
contains no element for medical
insurance or the near doubling
of rents; we cannot afford to
pay!
Yours faithfully

Boycott Bot/Zoo
Page 41
Dear Martin
I'm writing to your august
journal to protest most strongly
about the disgusting treatment I
received the other day whilst
attempting to purchase a cup of
tea in the Biology Common
Room. Not only was I pushed,
barged, jostled and sworn at as I
tried to ask a friend at the front
of the extremely long queue to
buy me the lifesaving liquid, but
I was also encountered by a
group of angry life scientists as I
walked away, who demanded in
highly vociferous terms just
what the hell I was doing in their
common room, anyway.
I feel that the time has come
for action. Of late coffee breaks
have become increasingly un-
comfortable due to the large
numbers of these people assem-
bling in the Biology Common
Room. It's not a very nice place
anyway, and I feel that students
like myself who are not life
scientists should show their
disapproval of such practices by
boycotting the Biology Common
Room as of today, and using the
facilities in our own depart-
ments.
Yours sincerely

Tea'd Off
Dear Sir
We would like to bring to
your attention a festering sore of
discontent, a veritable puss-body
not ten yards from your office.
We talk of the streaming of
hordes of a parasitic variety of
student (mostly maths, physics
and chem eng types, with a
noteable super-variety of as-
sorted hacks) to the Bot/Zoo
C o m m o n Room at tea and
coffee breaks.
Many Life students and staff
have been unable to obtain tea
• • • M a r c h
and coffee there as a result of the
aforementioned dregs of society
having scoffed the lot. or by
force of numbers prevented
entry to the common room. Bot
Zoo incidentally stands for
Botany and Zoology, as does
Chem Eng stand for Chemical
Engineering.
This has led to much ill-feeling
why not only the other day five
physicists were killed by a
maniacal student with a York-
shire billbook. and others are
taking up kung fu and carrying
shot guns. Full scale riot would
seem to be no more than a petrol
bomb away.
Perhaps it should be made
clear that the Bot Zoo tea service
is run and subsidised by the Life
Sci d i v i s i o n for use by its
students and staff. How would
these social misfits like it if we
went round disturbing their tea
machines (or what ever they
have). The more scientific
amongst us have pointed out
that there is only one way to find
out. Let's be reasonable before it
really gets silly.

Cloud's Defence
Dear Sir
I am writing in response to
your article and two letters
concerning Morning Cloud.
The recent copy of Morning
Cloud was produced with the
objective of being humourous. It
did not attempt to present well-
debated political points. It
certainly did not hope to imply
that the Conservative Society's
membership is of a low calibre,
which it is not. The review
purposely offered satire rather
than argument and consequently
some may h considered it
rather 'undergraduate'.
The other political societies
and ourselves have always
produced serious publicity in the
past. Most students, rightly or
wrongly, have little time for this
sort or propacand'i. This edition
of Morning Cloud offered an
unusual one-off experiment. It
has certainly attracted attention
and I hope succeeded in its aim
of providing amusement. To
those it has offended greatly, I
apologise, and hope you look
forward to the next serious
edition of Morning Cloud.
Yours faithfully
John Pattison
Conservative Society Chairman
Standing Down
Dear Sir
Unfortunately I have had to
withdraw my candidature for
1CU President this year. The
reason for this is solely because
1 have been appointed assistant
manager of the Fremantle Hotel
during the summer vacation.
1 apologise to all those who
seconded me and to all those
who were going to vote for me
(—if any).
1 wish the rest of the candi-
dates luck (except Phil Nathan).
Yours sincerely

New Religion?
'You never see animals going
through the aosurd and often
horrible fooleries of magic and
religion'—Aldous Huxley
Dear Editor
For various reasons religion
has been subjected to an im-
mense amount of criticism yet, it
remains true that the great world
civilisations were only able to
grow into maturity because of
spiritual direcuon and religious
beliefs. Without an effective
religion guiding the spirits of the
people there could be no growth
of civilisation, no novelty, no
new beauty, no riev joy.
As a Baha'i, I beiieve that the
human race stands little chance
in the future unless we build a
new world civilisation. This new
world civilisation can only be
inspired by an upsurge of
spiritual knowledge which can
only be maintained through
religion.
But what kind of religion? A
religion which will unite man
kind, allowing for the diverse
religions, cultural and social
backgrounds fo the people,
remove the causes of hatred and
strife, and be in harmony with
science and reason to become a
constructive power in fulfilling
the requirements of man in this
day and age.
There is no need for a religion
which has lost its essential truths
and has been polluted by man's
limited ideas to become merely a
practice of rituals, dogma and
fanaticism and be the cause of
bloodshed and war.
'If religion becomes a cause of
dislike, hatred, and division, it
were better to be without it...
Any religion which is not a cause
of love and unity is no religion.'
From the Baha'i Writings
Yours sincerely
Roger Kingdon
Sec of the Baha'i Society
