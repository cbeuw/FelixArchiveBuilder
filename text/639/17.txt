F o l l o w i n g Tuesday's A C C
Meeting the travel subsidy has
been determined and a fairly
accurate estimate of total costs
in now available.
Dates for the diary: next
Sunday (March 13) is the night
out to sec Streatham Redskins
Ice Hockey Team bruising it up
with the Glasgow Dynamoes.
Total cost is £3.10, sign up at
Sportscentre.
Squash C l u b A G M (and
elections) is at lunchtime above
Harry's on March 17, while the
Annual Dinner is on Tuesday 22
at the Cumberland Hotel.
The much feared IC continue to
destroy all opposition in the
U L U League. To follow up last
week's (unreported) 10-0 blitz on
Barts, we defeated Westminster
5-0 leaving us yet to concede a
goal in four matches.
This new winning style results
from replacing Python in the
hole with Dan, who manages to
score more frequently in that
position. Jim's kung fu tactics
and Stewarts ball handling have
also left their marks on the
o p p o s i t i o n . J o h n must be
congratulated for both turning
up and being sober.
The next beerswilling session
was preceded by a friendly vs
Beckenham. This was won 6-2,
with Rich not sure where his
loyalties lay, playing safe and
consequently scoring for each
side.
On Saturday February 26 with
only two of our swim team and
four of our polo squad we took
on Oxford and Guys Hospital.
Performances were greatly
affected by the previous evenings
activities resulting in Oxford
d o m i n a t i n g the s w i m m i n g
match. Highlights were Ben's
breaststroking victory and Jim
hanging on to win the I M . The
'lows' included Rich's pitstop in
the freestyle although recovering
to take second place. Score: 73-
56 to them.
Despite having the Newquay
Zoo Snake House (Python and
Big (?) Brother Anaconda) we
went down 5-1 against Oxford.
Guys were put off though and
we won 10-2. Rich and Jims new
tactic of tackling each other and
leaving the ball for the opposi-
tion causes concern. Ta to Pete
(?), Anaconda and Fiona's
costume; and bollocks to those
who didn't turn up.
PS: The exec would appreciate
if the other half of the team
would turn up on Monday (vs
Isleworth).
Support also required—7
o'clock Sportscentre.
Volleybal
Imperial College Volleyball
Club met Bristol Polytechnic last
Saturday in the Quarterfinal of
the E V A National Students Cup.
Bristol were last year's runner-
up in this competition, and so it
was perhaps quite a shock to
them to find such a strong
Imperial team. Despite a ner-
vous start in the first set, which
we lost 15-9, Imperial rallied to
claim the second, the score at a
close 17-15. H o w e v e r , the
surprise of the match came in the
third set when we went into a
quick 7-1 lead, and needed a
total of only eight minutes to
win by an incredible 15-1
margin. The fourth set saw some
impressive play from both sides,
Bristol having been roused by a
talk from their ex-England
International player/coach
Keith Nicholls, and IC went
down 15-11, leaving the fifth set
the decider. The scores remained
nearly level till 6-5 for Bristol,
and then the experience, team
play and better coaching of the
opposition began to tell. A n
injury to our star setter Man
Lam ('diabolically painful!')
didn't help, and IC exited
gracefully, the score 9-15.
On the whole, it was an
excellent, well fought match
which, with a bit of luck, might
have gone our way but kudos to
Bristol for inflicting on us our
first defeat in two years (in
England, at any rate!).
My thanks to all the IC team,
named below, for a splendid
effort, maybe we'll do it next
year. Also thanks to all the
spectators for taking the trouble
to come and watch, and cheer us
on, and the poor suckers I roped
in as linesmen and scorekeepers
at the last minute.
A quick reminder that on
Wednesday March 9 we are at
home to Tottenham College,
who are not a weak team, so see
you all at 14:00 at the court.
IC team: M Lam (Capt), C
Christou, A Green, A Knap, D
Song, P Peplinksi, P Walker, A,
Hedges, M James.
Football
Firsts
IC vs Goldsmiths 4-0
A fine performance on the eve of
the cup-final totally demolished
the opposition. Some scintilla-
ting high speed football resulted
in IC leading 4-0 at half-time
with Stephenson recording a
hat-trick of real class. The
second goal was a gem; four one
touch passes saw the ball move
from the IC defence past a
bemused Q M C goalkeeper. John
McGuckin had a fine game in
mid-field as did John Rigby and
Nick Flannagan up front.
Cup Final
On Saturday March 5 IC 1st XI
defend the U n i v e r s i t y o f
London Intercollegiate Chal-
lenge Cup which they won last
year. With this in mind the team
had intended to go for a week's
altitude training in the Himi-
layas, but due to academic
commitment and total confi-
dence this was changed to a team
workout in the Queen's on
Friday afternoon. IC will hope
to call on the experience gained
in last year's final to overcome
UC. The team will be chosen
from the following squad or
players: Harlow, Curran, Reeve,
Griffiths, Dunhill, McGuckin,
Page, G a s k i l l , Stephenson,
Rigby, Rickard, Chamberlain,
Lay and Laurence (one more
and we'd have a rugby team).
Coaches leave the Union at
1:15pm for Motspur and will be
free; the ride not the coaches?!
All support would be welcomed.

KO Cup
IC vs Q M C 11-0
This report is hereby dedicated
to Janet Folkes. There are some
who doubt that Janet moves at
anything above walking pace
and there are some who doubt
her ability at badminton. This
report is a testament to her
ability, tenacity, radiance etc
(sorry if I over did this a bit
Janet!).
To move on. We won the
cup!! We won it easily!! The
team played brilliantly. At last
we've found the winning for-
mula. Pre-match preparation
was calculated to produce a
devastating effect. Ian's pallid
colour and retching noises were
used to good effect. Dominic
closely resembled a member of
the undead fraternity and Janet
Ellis tried to make up for her
tiredness by dazzling all and
sundry with a knockoutk track-
suit!
Class was provided by Lee,
AndreOe and Huf Chrisslet. A
word must be said about Jane.
She is fast acquiring the nick-
name 'chimney'. Obviously she
hasn't seen the 'stub' anti-
persperent adverts yet. Still she's
got a long way to go to match
Ian who is in danger of igniting
himself.
Congratulations to everyone
for such a resounding victory. I
think we even eclipsed the
Bermondsey by-election as
victory of the year.
On a serious note—could
everyone w a n t i n g to go to
Ireland hurry up and tell me—or
else I'll go spare!!
Also, we have been challenged
to a darts match by the Chess
Club. We accept this challenge
and anyone interested in beating
them should see Chris.
