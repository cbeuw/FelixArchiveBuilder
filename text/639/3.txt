Election Rumpus
A serious complaint has been
made about the publicity used by
one of the candidates in the
sabbatical elections. Lee Paddon,
who is standing for the post of
F E L I X Editor, has accused
Pallab Ghosh, the only other
candidate, of exceeding the
permitted level of spending.
Mr Ghosh had his election
posters and hand-outs printed
by Mistral Print, a London firm
which receives the majority of
the Union's external printing
contracts. He is claiming that
he was charged £20 for the work,
thus keeping the total cost of his
campaign below the £45 allowed
by the Elections Committee. He
said that M i s t r a l Print had
offered a large discount because
of their connection with F E L I X ,
and their friendship with Mr
Ghosh. M r Paddon, he said,
could also have had his posters
produced by Mistral if he had
wanted to.
Mr Paddon has pointed out
the cost of publicity similar to
Mr Ghosh's would normally be
over £85. He told F E L I X he was
unaware of the possibility of a
discount available to IC Election
candidates, and believes that M r
Ghosh has used his position to
give an unfair advantage.
"the Elections Committee has
not yet reached a decision on the
complaint, but expects to do so
sometime today. The Returning
Officer has requested F E L I X
not to disclose further details
until after the elections for fear
that it will prejudice the results.
Darbishire Winner
The election for next year's
R C S U executive was ratified on
Tuesday. The successful candi-
dates were Eric Darbishire as
President, Dave W Parry as
Vice-President and Susan Hum-
phrey as Honorary Secretary.
Although the election was
inquorate—only 274 votes were
cast by an electorate of 1,800—it
was ratified without opposition
at Tuesday's RCS Union Gene-
ral Meeting. Other officers for
next year are Elisabeth Parfitt,
who will be Academic Affairs
Officer, and Mark Gillet, the
Honorary Junior Treasurer.
Flour Power
About thirty students from Queen
Mary College carried out a raid
on the Union Building yesterday
afternoon.
Shortly after the Hustings
U G M , the students ran into the
Beit Quad throwing eggs, flour
and cans of burning creosote.
They then attacked the Union
Office on the first floor, but staff
and several Union members held
them off, and little damage was
done inside the office other than
a smoke bomb being let off
which filled the East staircase
with dense orange smoke.
The raid, which was in retalia-
tion for the violation of the
Q M C mascot, taken almost
exactly a year ago, is believed to
be a part of their Rag Week.
Q M C students' Union is ex-
pected to receive a formal
complaint that their raid was not
in the spirit of inter-collegiate
mascotry, and a cleaning bill
from IC. Aerosoc's paper aeroplane competition was held from the roof of Beit
Quad last Thursday. Photo: Jonathan Smith
Heath Slams Leaders over World Problems
The failure to solve many of the
world's economic and social
problems over the last decade is
due to a paralysis of world
leadership, according to former
Prime Minister Edward Heath.
He contrasted the present
situation with the imaginative
leadership of post-war years
when the present international
institutions such as the United
Nations, the I M F and the World
Bank were established, and the
Marshall plan helped to rebuild
Europe with American assist-
ance.
M r H e a t h , addressing a
meeting organised by the Con-
servative Society, spoke of the
resulting thirty years of peace
and prosperity with the success
of detente and the transforma-
tion from war to peace time
economies. But since the early
seventies these old institutions
had inevitably become outdated,
and their structure and opera-
tion is in urgent need of reform.
Without new qualities of leader-
F E L I X H H a H H H H I
ship to bring this about he
predicts a bleak outlook for
the
rest of this century.
In his speech, which was
enthusiastically received by the
large audience, M r H e a t h
outlined the history of inter-
national collaboration since the
war and relations between East
and West. He was strongly in
favour of negotiated disarma-
ment and deterrence, but feels
that more imaginative leader-
ship is needed to bring about
new agreements. But he also
believes that negotiations are the
only way forward and that
agreement is possible given the
pressures on both sides.
Turning to the problems of
the underdeveloped world, he
said that with large amounts of
unused manufacturing capacity
in the industrialised countries it
should be possibly to supply the
poor countires of the world with
the products they need but
c a n n o t a f f o r d to b u y . H e
mentioned the dangers of import
c o n t r o l to protect our o l d
labour-intensive industries such
as textiles because these are the
type of industry the Third World
depends on. There is a great
need to create the right econom-
ic conditions for this transfer of
wealth based on mutual self
interest: the developed world
.would have higher output and
employment and the under-
developed countries w o u l d
receive the goods and services
they desperately need. The world
monetary system, devised in
twenty-two days after war, is
in a state of disarray, ..e said.
But at the recent summit o!
world leaders nothing had been
decided about reforming the
system.
He defended the preseni
government, saying that al-
though they had not initially
accepted the findings of the
Brandt Report they have now
had a change of heart, and that
they have done a partial U-turn
on their overseas students
policy. It is he said, essential Tor
the West to provide the leader-
ship to take the world out of its
present crisis, or else under-
developed countries will be
driven into the arms of Moscow
or Peking resulting in political
and military interference in their
internal affairs.
