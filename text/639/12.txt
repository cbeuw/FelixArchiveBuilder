ICLUBS & SOCIETIES!
RSM
Thanks very much to everyone who came out
to Nottingham last weekend and I hope you all
enjoyed yourselves.
The Rugby Sevens are this Sunday and are
great fun, so get your team down on the list
outside G20. A coach will be leaving from
outisde RSM at about 11:00 so try and make it
on time.
Papers for the elections will also be going up
next week so it's time for everyone to think
about what they want to do next year. Detailed
job descriptions will appear in a later
newsletter but if you need to know any
additional information just ask.
Finally thanks to everyone who watched us
beat RCS in the Raft Race and to all those who
toko part in the boat race when we thrashed
RCS and Guilds (even had to have our guys
drinking for them!).
Cheers.

Well, things are certainly warming up now.
The election papers for Guilds went up on
Monday and will come down today so make
sure you get your name down before 5:30pm.
This Sunday we have the Guilds Soccer
Sixes at Harrington.'
Why not come along—it doesn't matter if
you don't have a team with you, we can easily
make your own six up for you.
Then on Sunday evening we have the 'Prizes
and Election Barnight' in the Union Bar from
7:00pm. This will include the handing out of:
the beer prizes for Rugby Sevens; the lieer
prizes for Field Cup; the beer prizes lor Soccer
Sixes, and the drinking ot yards by .ill
prospective election candidates. This means
that if you are involved with most ot the above
you should be drunk well under the table by
11:00pm. But then perhaps you think I'm
wrong—so why not turn up and prove me
wrong.
Transport is also in prominence next week.
On Friday March 11 the Guilds Motor Club
has a rally and on Sunday March 13 there is a
Production Car Trial at Peter's Pit. Rochester.
Kent—see the Motor Club noticeboard in
Mech Eng for details. Also the Pedal Car Club
are initiating their publicity drive for a
sponsored cycle around the coast of Britain in
a human powered vehicle with a training
weekend starting on Saturday March 12. See
the Guilds Noticeboard for details of that.
Hope to see you at Soccer Sixes on Sunday
then
Deb Soc
On Tuesday March 8 we have our big event of
the year: Mr Eric Heffer, the prominent
Labour MP and Mr John Selwyn Gummer MP,
an ex-President of the Cambridge Union and
currently Under Secretary of State, Dept of
Employment are coming in to debate the
motion: 'This House Believes that strong trade
unions with the power to decisively influence
employers and governments, without
constraint from industrial relations legislation,
are necessary in an advanced technological
society'. To debate a motion of that length,
they must be good! The debate will take place
in Chem Eng 2 which is just off the walkway
next to the Bookshop and will be signposted on
the day. Please make every effort to attend this i
import,,. ; debate which should be of an i
excellent siandard and probably not nearly as
incompivnensible as the motion. All are
welcome to attend.

Nat Hist Soc
Geese. Pils and frostbite' No. no, a special
offer at the Union Bar, but the results of a long
weekend's field trip to Holland. While most
students were freezing in their bedsits, twelve
intrepid members of the society, were freezing
in the arctic wastes of Flevoland. neerino
through glazed binocuiars ai thousands of
geese wrapped in their home grown continen-
tal quilts.
Bodily warmth was restored by ine nightlife
of Amsterdam, (no, not thai nightlife!). Which
so overcame Herr ReiiKe-Grover that it
slipped his mind to buy a round, despite
constant reminders. Still, an enjoyable time
was had by all.
