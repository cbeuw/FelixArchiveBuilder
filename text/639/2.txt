External Affairs
Officer's Report
I March 4,
You've heard it all before, I.
know. However there can be
little harm done in repeating
it—the cuts will effect Y O U . Not
just arts students and the like but
the much needed science and
engineering graduates.
What will it mean in real
terms? In the large scale and
long term it w i l l mean an
extremely detrimental effect on
British industry who will not
have the engineers and scientists
it needs. This will cause a serious
weakening of our already shaky
industrial base at a time when we
really need to pull out all the
stops just to hold our own in
world markets.
In more immediate terms it
will lead to a narrowing of
opportunities in terms of choice
of courses and numbers of places
for more specialised subjects.
Higher rents in halls of resi-
dence, shorter library opening
times, less money for laboratory
projects are all areas in which
the cuts will bite next year for
starters.
For those of us who enjoy
recreational activities such as
sport or with the many and
varied clubs and ' societies the
effects will become apparent
next year. The Union, who funds
all the sporting activities at
College will not be able to
subsidise these events as much as
before; as was evidenced by the
row over cutting £36,000 from
next year's estimates. It will
mean running one or two less
hockey or football teams, far
higher charges for travel, fewer
activities generally.

Snooker Club won't get its
tables re-covered, gliding club its
new glider, H G Wells Society
will have to break even.
The cuts will have a noticeable
effect next year, even more so
the year after.
All this is leading to a plea
that you stop and think. Then,
rather than take the usual IC
apathetic 'Oh I'll have left in a
year/two years' approach really
pull the finger out and do
something!
And that something is attend-
ing the Educational Alliance
march on March 9. It's your
future as well as that of those
who follow you: don't think
things will be set right of their
own accord, they won't. It's up
to you, and I hope very much to
see you on March 9.
Date: March 9
Place: Assemble Queens Tower
travel to Tower Hill for Rally
Time: 12:30pm
