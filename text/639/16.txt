Last but not least we come to the best of a
poor bunch in Enigma, Cert 15, directed by
Jeannot Szwarc, now showing ABC Fulham
Road and Warner West End. A classic spy
thriller of the old school, set in that happy
hunting ground of postwar thrillers: East
Berlin. It has been modernised; the agent is
being sent in to steal a vital piece of
microelectronics and upon the outcome of his
mission rest the lives of five Soviet dissidents
whom the K G B have decided they can do
without, but essentially it's the good old
formula, recognisable in various forms from
Wheatley to Le Carre; double crossing, border
searches, people being severely beaten up,
others gagged and stuffed into broom
cupboards, while the hero borrows their
clothes to make good his escape. Usual stuff,
love it or hate it, it's purely a matter of taste.
There are no dramatic special effects;
mercifully we are spared yet another car chase
and some of the twists and turns try hard to be
original. But what can you do with a genre and
a format like this? You can get silly and have
the enemy agent as an android from outer
space bent on galactic domination for no
readily apparent reason, or you could throw in
a spot of supernatural jiggerypokery, but,
aiming for an audience with at least a little
padding between the ears, you're basically
^REVIEWS
stuck with it.
Enigma is a good spy film which you will
enjoy if you like spy films but haven't seen
every spy film from the 1950s on. I didn't feel it
generated any feeling of suspense and thrill;
our hero, Alex Holbeck is a really nice guy who
doesn't kill anyone and is so idealistic as to be
saintly. You want him to succeed and you
always feel he is going to. The screen is
enlivened by the usual stylish performance
you've come to expect from Derek Jacobi as
the East German security chief, who would
probably consider that smashing a walnut with
a sledgehammer was far too subtlet and by the
obligatory love interest in the shape of Brigitte
Fossey—nothing to complain about there, and
not a bad actress to boot.
Well, that about wraps it up this week, I'm a
little preoccupied right now with a certain
election next week, so it'll have to do. Still,
brevity is the soul of wit, as they say, so see
you next week.
