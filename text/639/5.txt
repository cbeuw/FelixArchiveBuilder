Elections
In case you hadn't noticed, on
Monday and Tuesday of next
week the. sabbatical elections will
be held. I C Union pays four
students the equivalent of £6,000
each to enable them to take a
year off studying and work full-
time as President, D e p u t y
President, Honorary Secretary
and F E L I X Editor. As I said last
week, i f you want to make
sure this money is well spent (and
you ought to, if you have any
concern at all for clubs, sports,
CCUs, concerts, publications or
any of the hundred and one
facilities the Union provides)
then it is essential that you get
informed on the aptitude of the
various candidates and elect the
most suitable into office. Last
week I spoke of the importance
of attending yesterday's Hustings
U G M : this week I shall presume
to advise you on deciding whom
to support.
Starting with the negative side
of things, you should not be
influenced by colour, race, sex or
other peripherals. This may
seem obvious, but some people
still make their decisions on
such issues: Mary Freeman
would never have had such a
large majority last year had she
not been female.
A wise candidate will choose
an eloquent proposer, but you
should not be influenced by him.
The proposer's job is to put
forward any qualities which
modesty may prevent the candi-
dates themselves making. Always
remember that the proposer has
nothing to do with how well the
candidates will do their job.
Bear i n mind that most
candidates will have asked
someone else to produce their
publicity. Poster design should
not therefore influence you,
except, perhaps, when a candi-
date for F E L I X Editor has
produced his own publicity.

I was approached by a complete
stranger in Southside Bar. 'I've
been asked to give you this,' he
said, presenting me with a
magnificent satin-lined wool-
len cloak. I expressed some
puzzlement over whether this
was really intended for me.
'Oh yes,' said the stranger. ' A
friend of yours gave it to me to
give to you.' I carefully enquired
as to the identity of this mysteri-
ous benefactor and my fears
were confirmed when I was
given the visiting card of the
coat's owner and read with a

Finally in this catalogue of
mistrust, remember that i n
manifestos and hustings speeches
some candidates are tempted to
exaggerate, distort or even to lie
outright about their qualification
in the past and their ideas for the
future. Weigh up their promises,
and consider whether their
suggestions are as realistic as
they first appear. Don't forget
Stephen Goulder's promise of a
refectory boycott! (On the other
hand you can't complain if a
candidate does implement his
promises: Stephen Goulder also
promised in his election bumf to
support clubs and societies
financially at the expense of the
CCUs).
So what should you base
your decision on? Well, despite
the lavish promises and vague
platitudes which many of the
manifestos contain, it is still
worth winnowing the folly for
the grain or two of truth among
the chaff, and manifestos,
received intelligently, provide
the most accessible impression
of a candidate's view:..
There is also the hustings
speech, which is a surprisingly
good way of observing a candi-
date's behaviour under pressure.
Although some candidates are
obviously better public speakers
than others, it's amazing how
true values shine out, despite
nerves, especially during the
questions. If you didn't go to
yesterday's U G M , I urge you to
find some friends who did and to
ask them about what happened.
And many candidates go from
door to door in halls and student
houses, directly canvassing for
votes. While this can be a real
nuisance at times it does provide
the best opportunity of all to
gain a first-hand impression of
what the candidate's personality
is like, to put your own questions
to them, and to find out what
they think of the opposition—
something most candidates dare
not say in public!
Finally a word or two about
the voting procedure. This
caused a great deal of confusion
last year and culminated in
Marco Ledwold's reversal of a
U G M decision. Consequently I
have asked Jon Stanley to write
a short article explaining the
procedure in detail. This is
printed on page 7. Do read it
before you vote.
I've gone on at some length; I
hope you haven't felt bored or
patronised but it is so important
to use your vote wisely. Over the
last four years (and perhaps
more) there has always been at
least one sabbatical who should
never have been elected. This
year, with so many cuts being
made in education, it is more
important than ever to choose
an Exec who will work hard to
represent our interests. You have
one vote in each of the four
elections: don't waste it.
Rag Week
Last week was Rag Week. How
many of you knew that? To say
that Rag was enthusiastically
supported this year would be
more than a slight exaggeration.
At the Rag and Drag Disco on
Saturday there were badly a
dozen people present; the RCS
Smoking Concert, which i n
previous years has packed the
Concert Hall, attracted about
sixty people. Other events have
been equally badly supported.
What is the reason for this
surge of apathy? Many people
have asserted that it is because
Rag Week was held in February,
rather than November which is
traditional, but this reason is
invalid. In November many
students ( p a r t i c u l a r l y first
years) have not fully settled into
their year o f study, and are
rather apprehensive about
indulging in stunts which range
from the eccentric to the ridi-
culous. February is a better time
for Rag Week, a fact borne out
by virtually every other student
union in the country.
No, the reason IC Rag flopped
this year was because of bad
organisation. There was vir-
tually no publicity (did you see
anything advertising the Smoking
Concert?) and people were not
made aware of Rag at all.
Next year there is no need for
Rag Week to revert to November
for it to be successful, but it must
be better organised.
