Last Wednesday the club again
showed itself to be the most
prestigious in College with a
devastating performance in a
match against London Hospital.
Despite the intense cold in the
range notable scores came from
Johnathan, Julia and Pauline.
Our managing director, Steve
Harrison, managed to lose some
of our team and, in a moment of
extreme Guinlessness, left his
equipment behind the bar. We
are all hoping that this amazing
sense of organisational com-
petence remains with our illus-
trious captain for this weekend's
Bisley trip.
In the handicap rifle tourna-
ment. Mark Bourke pulled out
two perfect scores against all the
odds, beating Gary Smith who is
again eliminated—will he never
succeed? Mark, the organiser of
the tournament, now meets
Andrew Hamilton in the final.
Andrew had previously quashed
the resistance offered by, Tim
Higgs, who joins Gary Smith as
a semi-final drop-out.
Noel Lindsay, who enjoys
. having his feet tickled by buxom
young ladies, did absolutely
nothing of any importance this
week, but it is said that he is to
give his demonstration at the
'electric sleeping bag in modern
society' in the near future.
Don't forget that the week-
end's Bisley trip leaves the
Sportscentre at about 9:15am. If
you want to go, but haven't been
selected, please turn up anyway
as there may be one or two spare
spaces.
Last weekend saw the annual
' competition for the 'Castaways
• Cup' the Inter-London three
boat team racing trophy. None
London college and hospital
teams (inc two from IC) and one
invited team from City Univer-
sity were entered for this, the
most prestigious event of the UL
Sailing calendar.
A brief glance at the form card
showed that competition was to
be tough, with no less than seven
of the fifteen man squad, chosen
by the British Universities
Sailing Association in their
penultimate selection of a seven
man team to visit America,
sitting at the blunt end of boats.
On Saturday sailing was in
two leagues, all sail all twice.
ICII were struggling, but despite
being beaten by a combined
medical school team and QMC,
the two winners of the league,
they put up a good fight and
raced well.
ICI in the other league were
beaten by City, a dark horse, but
went through to the semi-final
being second in the league.
On Sunday ICI were drawn
against QMC in the semi-final. It
might have been a Wednesday
afternoon practice as six ICI
helms chased each other round
'The Harp' in some skilful team
racing. However ICI lost both
races and so left the competition.
QMC ultimately beat City in the
final and so broke seven years of
IC domination of the competi-
tion.
ICII beat UC in the final of
the 'Castaways Plate' (Wooden
Spoon) competition.
Thanks are due to Castaways
for excellent courses and for
their skill in contriving perfect
conditions wind and weather
wise, we had long believed the
race officer to be a deity but this
surely proves it! Best wishes to
Dave—drying out a thermal suit
for the scond consecutive,
for the second consecutive year.
Fencing
Pggel8l
In Saturday's fencing match
against arch-rivals Kings Col-
lege, only the fine performance
of the ladies foil team saved IC
from total defeat. Led by club
captain Madeleine Spottis-
woode, who won all three of her
bouts, and ably seconded by
Kathy Hollinshead and Di
Heppel, the ladies swept to
victory by 6-3.
Liu Huang fenced well in his
first match for the novice foil
team but IC was beaten overall
6-3. The fiercely contested mens
foil ended in an 8-8 draw with
newcomer Simon Brock doing
well to win two bouts against the
experienced Kings team. The
other team members Tony
Ambery, Peter Baines and
veteran Harvey Bird were just
not able to find consistent form.
In the sabre and epee events
IC fought hard, in some cases to
the point of total exhaustion, but
were beaten in both 6-3. Harvey

Bird's two victories in epce bouts
provided some relief from total
gloom. It must be pointed out
that because of the club's
shortage of experienced fencers,
several members already men-
tioned plus Graham Burt loot,
competed in more than one
event.
Firsts
Gutteridge Plate
IC vs Barts 12-6
IC started this final very strong-
ly, finding themselves in their
opponents 25 for most of the
first half. However the only
score they managed in this
period of pressure was a penalty
by Steve Philips.
St Barts came back strongly in
the second half and IC's defence
proved stout enough after
letting through an easy try. Steve
Philips then kicked another
penalty late in the second half to
tie the score at 6 all. Half an
hour of extra time was then
played, in which the IC pack
dominated again. Steve Thomp-
son crashed through three
tackles to score near the posts
and from on IC never lost their
grip on the game.
Tries: S Thompson, S PHilips
(1 con, 2 pen).
Team: M Thompson, P Har-
doe, S Thompson, P Clarke, P
Eastland, S Philips, S Johns, J
Davies, D McGee, W King, A
Ralph, C Henderson, P Richards,
C de Rohan, J Whittle.
Seconds
IC vs RFC 3-0
The team once again relied on
unknowing volunteers to enable
them to stumble onto that
hallowed battle field at Harling-
ton. The opposition graciously
donated us a player so that they
didn't actually have to face the
fearsome Phil Huge—something
or other—he refereed instead
and amazingly no one com-
mented on his eyesight.
Match report? What can you
say? Fourteen blindfolded, one-
legged lunatics would have
moved less randomly and more
constructively. It if wasn't for a
strongish South West wind
nobody would ever have moved
in the same direction as anyone
else.
Still, they didn't score any and

Mark Hudson did get three
points for an Oily Campbell
special that deserved more, so
we won.
IC vs Wasps 3-42
Word Puzzle
1. Team: Steve, Chris, Nigel,
Mark. Ed, Gary. Ian, Mark,
Will, Nick. Sean, Neil, Mick.
Jimmy, Steve and Tim appeared
to have been beamed up by
Scottie.
2. Ian completed the warm up
while the rest tried in vain to
finish the 'Telegraph' crossword.
Steve had trouble with Gary's
head and Gary had trouble with
Steve's stomach. Everybody
ended up like eggs in an ome-
lette.
3. A striped stinging insect
resembling a bee turned up and
wallowed like a buffalo in the
mud. Sean did a very poor
impression of Ollie Campbell
whereas Nick did slightly better,
although he couldn't get the
accent right.
4. The answer to the universe.
5. Mark the Boot got our only
points. The backs kept falling
over while the forwards never
got up. We all returned home in
a very torpid btate and hoped the
coach driver's dinner was burnt.
Answer:
IC Second XIII, were beaten, by
Wasps, 42-3.

Thirds
IC vs Uxbridge
Conditions: humidity 0-4%; air
pressure 770mm; ground mois-
ture content 100%; player
comfort: low; air temp: 9°C
alcohol content of leftwinger:
totally inebriated (but still made
2 yards and 20 down-outs cold).
Result: close. Monsewer Jump
scored one excellent goal.
Regrettably, expert goalminding
by the opposition resulted in a 5-
1 defeat. At the end of the match
the captain (Jim) was quick to
arrive at the bar (quicker than
the leftwinaer anyway), such
leadership! He got quickly
pissed,nearly forgot his coat and
only just caught the coach back.
The following day Jim returned
to Harlington to play football
and brutally kneed the opposi-
tion's goalkeeper in the head
With characteristic calmness.
