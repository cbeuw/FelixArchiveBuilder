with nukes and conventional
weapons. The nukes are pointed
at the soft underbelly of the
USSR while the hardware will be
used to 'stabilise' the Gulf and
Iran.
Last but not least, the country
was bled white by 'import-
substituting industries' (for this
read multi-national investments
in low-tech screwdriver plant
assembling imported compon-
ents for a highly protected home
market) which collapsed in 1979
under the weight of Â£20b foreign
debts. The I M F doctors moved
in with the familiar dose of
'monetarist' austerity packages.
The cure was worse than the
disease as unemployment rose to
around 20%, real wages halved
and the entire burden of paying
off the debts dumped on ordi-
nary working people. Hence no
human rights, no unions, no
political parties. Keep your nose
down and work....or else.
As each section of society
came under the tender mercies
and tutelage of the all-wise, all-
seeing and benign generals (the
top one ran for President in
November, and yes, you guessed
it right, he was the only candi-
date and yes he received 91.8%
of the votes) the universities
were also 'reformed', with the
finesse and concern one has
come to expect from military
gentlemen of a certain persua-
sion.
The Turkish military regime is
trying to transform schoolrooms
and lecture halls into surrogate"
military barracks. It has intro-
duced strict new requirements
for nationalist indoctrination in
high schools, has ended uni-
versity autonomy, replaced
elected university officers with
appointed ones and has set up
the High Education Council
(from whence the British Coun-
cil sponsored pair of doctors
have emanated) to mould the
c o u n t r y ' s i n t e l l e c t u a l a n d
academic life according to its
own image.
The entire educational appar-
atus is now controlled by the
Head of State who nominates
the p r i n c i p a l o f the H i g h
Education Council ( H E C , spelt
Y O K in Turkish). The Council
has purged most rectors and
deans of faculty (Dr Tezel's rise
to his current position at M E T U
is not entirely unconnected with
the purge of his former col-
leagues), introduced national
c u r r i c u l u m guidelines, has
reorganised the academic career
structure and has redefined the
status and teaching duties of all
academic staff. As the Times
Higher Education Supplement
headline declares: 'Politics off
the agenda as fear and confusion
reign' (11/2/83). A l l this was
accomplished by military fiat
which excluded consultation,
discussion and debate.
This assault on the country's
academic establishment was
compounded by show trials
designed to intimidate and
punish leading intellectuals. As
widely reported in the Western
European press, the arrest and
imprisonment of the executive
committee of Turkey's first and
only peace association fitted in
with this orchestrated terror
campaign. The Turkish Peace
Association executive, who were
released on bail just before
Christmas but sill face thirty
year sentences, included a vice-
chancellor, two professors and
four lecturers. Of the latter, Dr
Haluk Tosun, received his PhD
from Imperial College in 1974
or 1975 and was head of the
Department of Electrical Eng-
ineering at M E T U prior to his
imprisonment. Like all arrested
academics, he has since lost his
job. (For more information on
the TP A trial see E N D Special
Report T U R K E Y : P E A C E O N
T R I A L available from Euro-
pean Nuclear Disarmament,
227, Seven Sisters Road, London
N4, 90p). . As with the peace
movement the executive of the
Turkish Writers' Union are also
being tried by a military tribunal
held under 'war time conditions'.
All in all, martial laws courts
have called for 4,000 death
penalties.
This then is the real story
behind D o c t o r s Tezel and
Guruz's double-act around the
campus circuit in this country.
The name of Imperial College is
at the top of their hit-list. British
academics who are being ap-
proached to work in Turkey
should surely have the same
qualms as when they are ap-
proached by burly gentlemen
with South African accents. We
can reel off a list of names which
can read like the Who's Who of
repression and torture in the
w o r l d : G a l t i e r i , P i n o c h e t ,
Stroessner, Duarte and so forth.
But the thing about Turkey is
that it is a part of Europe. If the
nukes refused by the rest of
Europe find their way into the
US bases in Turkey then it really
matters who runs this outpost of
N A T O and how. Look at the
havoc caused by Galtieri amongst
the sheep and penguins and then
think of the distance between
London and Istanbul. Chilling
isn't it?

ELECTIONS
HOW TO VOTE
Every year votes are wasted due
to a misunderstanding of the
voting schedule. Here Jon
Stanley explains the system.
A single transferable vote system
(STV) is used in the sabbatical
elections, and in most other I C U
elections. This article describes
how STV operates and how to
vote using STV.
STV enables electors to place
candidates in an order of
preference. If their first prefer-
ence candidate is unsuccessful
their vote is transferred to their
second preference. If their
second vote is unsuccessful their
vote is transferred to their third
preference, and so on,
At each stage the candidate
with the lowest number of votes
is eliminated and his votes are
reallocated according to next
preferences. A candidate is
elected once he has more votes
than all the remaining candi-
dates put together.
It is also possible to use STV
in a multiple-seat election.
Voting is done in exactly the
same way but a more compli-
cated counting procedure is
necessary to reallocate votes
received in excess of the number
required to be elected (called the
'quota').
The procedure for voting in
the I C U sabbatical elections on
Monday and Tuesday, March 7
and 8 is straightforward and will
now be described.
The first requirement is your
Unioncard. Y o u will not be
given voting papers unless you
| remember to bring it with you.
Voting is done in the same
way for all four elections. To
vote for the candidate of your
first preference you must place
the figure 1 opposite the candi-
date's name. Ticks or crosses
will not be counted. (Despite this
warning, it seems, some voters
insist on putting crosses on the
voting paper and wasting their
vote.)
If you wish, you can show a
second preference by placing the
figure 2 against that candidate's
name, a third preference by
writing the figure 3 against your
third preference and so on, up
the number of candidates in the
election.
Figure 1 gives some examples
of valid votes and figure 2 shows
some invalid voting papers.

If it happens that none of the
candidates are p a r t i c u l a r l y
popular there is a chance that an
election will be rerun in the
summer term. You may want
this to happen in the hope that a
new candidate will emerge and
be elected, someone so popular
that large numbers of people feel
compelled to vote despite other
pressing concerns like exams.
Following the decision taken :it
yesterday's U G M , a sabbatical
election can no longer be
declared inquorate. Apart from
reruns because of irregularities
in the election procedure, the
elections for President, Deputy
President and Honorary Secre-
tary can only be rerun if the
number of deliberate abstentions
exceeds the number of votes cast
for the candidates. Because of a
quirk in the rules, this does not
apply to the F E L I X Editor, and
this election can only be rerin
because of irregularities in
procedure.
It follows that for the election
of President, Deputy President
and. Honorary Secretary, if you
want to try to get the election
rerun (possibly because you feel
that none of the candidates is
suitable) you should mark your
voting paper with the word
'Abstain'. In the election for
F E L I X Editor there is very little
you can do!
