ALL-TIME RAG RECORD
Over 400 IC students collected a total of £2,555 on Saturday as
they tiddh winked the length of Oxford Street in the second Rag
stunt of the year. This represents the largest amount ever collected
from this traditional event. The money is donated to the charity
Mencap.
The combined forces of the
CCUs took startled West End
shoppers by storm with RCS
starting from Marble Arch and
Guilds from Tottenham Court
Road. The miners took to the
middle of the road so that
absolutely no one got away.
The number one collector, a
nattily dressed Guildsman, raised
£49 and Regalia Shop salesman
Carl Burgess who winked all the
way, received a £16 donation
from one generous character.
FELIX Editor Pallab Ghosh was
seen in the Cockney Pride more
than an hour before the event
ended, drinking large quantities
of alcohol and massaging his sore
feet. He still managed to collect
£13, Gaynor Lewis raised £15,
Sean Davis raised nothing and
Christine Teller stayed in bed.
Irishman Sean Davis, not one
of the sharpest people at IC at the
best of times, got hopelessly
drunk and lost the phone number
of Mencap and was seen scurry-
ing frantically all over Piccadilly
Circus searching for a phone
book.
After contacting Mencap Mr
Davis decided to hop onto a
passing bus and tiddlywink on
board just to say he had tiddly-
winked the length of Oxford
Street. He ended up in Islington.
The success of the event was
due to the sterling efforts of Sean
Davis, James Benbow (Rag
Treasurer) and Dave Parry (RCS
VP). After sorting out the Rag
files they were able to persuade
Mencap to allow ICU to use their
street licences. Police congratu-
lated President Gaynor Lewis on
the organisation of the trouble-
free event.
There is still a vacancy for Rag
Chairman and the post seems'
unlikely to be filled before Rag
Week. But the future looks bright
for Rag. Larger stunts are
planned including a depart-
mental street collection during
Rag Week. This has the potential
of raising more than twice as
much as Tiddlywinks if a similar
number of people turn up.
