Guilds
Winkers
Twenty Imperial students,
mostly from City & Guilds Union
invaded Capital Radio last
Friday to give a demonstration of
winking.
After a short practice at South
Ken tube they descended upon
the unsuspecting Capital Radio
studio.
Ed Braman, the producer/
presenter of the news, was
amazed when informed that 400
people would be winking down
Oxford Street.
Mike Stuart, President of City
& Guilds Union, in characteristic
style hogged all the publicity and
succeeded only in making a total
Baldy Mike Stuart hogging

wally of himself, as usual, to the
nation's capital and was given a
demonstration by Charles Relle,
the London Open Tiddlywink
Champion.
Music While You Eat?
The smart new Royal College of
Music refectory, which at the
beginning of term proudly dis-
played invitations to all IC
students from its windows, is now
introducing a 30p surcharge on
all meals to anyone not pro-
ducing a RCM Student Associa-
tion card.
This has become necessary,
Petra Dargan, Vice President of
the Student Association, ex-
plained, because of the extra-
ordinary number of IC students
using the canteen. The students
when questioned by the SA as to
why they were using RCM's
facility explained, in rather un-
savoury terms, the difference that
exists between the food served at
the RCM canteen and 'the food
served in the College canteens.
The RCM has only one can-
teen, the previous one in the old
part of the building now being
used as a library, and this is
intended for RCM staff and
students alike. But staff and
students are now reluctant to use
the canteen as the queues are
always very long, and the Student
Association Office has been
flooded with complaints from
angry and hungry professors.
The Student Association feel the
30p surcharge is the only fair and
feasible solution to their over-
crowding problem.
The SA denied that Victor
Mooney, Imperial College's
Refectory Manager, has pres-
surised them to levy the sur-
charge to make his prices more
competitive.

Armed Robbery at Waitrose
Armed thieves made off with
takings from Gloucester Road's
Waitrose supermarket on Mon-
day.
In the audacious raid the two
men stood outside the store as
Securicor guards collected sacks
of money. As soon as they set
foot on the pavement the robbers
pounced, seizing the loot.
They then ran through the
store, brandishing .their
handguns as stunned staff and
shoppers looked on helpless. The
Waitrose manager and Securicor
guards followed the thieves hot
foot as they ran up Gloucester
Road towards Kensington High
Street.
They soon had to give up the
chase, as the villains made off in a
fast car.
FELIX reporter Dave Rowe
was in the store during the raid.
"I went rigid when I sawthe theft"
said David. "It was like a bolt
from the blue." He abandoned
his groceries to run to a nearby
telephone box, where he in-
formed the nation's press of the
theft. (There goes another FELIX
exclusive-Ed.)
Silwood: More Balls
The Silwood Ball which was
banned last academic year will
happen again this year.
This extremely popular annual
event, run by the Royal College
of Science Union, was prohibited
due to the mess and disorganisa-
tion after last year's event. An
expensive oak table was
scratched and several lawns were
damaged by the coaches which
ferried people to and from the
ball.
The RCSU had its grant cut
this year as there was no expected
expenditure for the Silwood Ball.
But ICU President Gaynor Lewis
negotiated at length with
Professor Way, the Ex-Director,
of Silwood Park' and other
members of the Silwood Park
committee to get the event
reinstated.
She managed to persuade the
Silwood residents to allow the
ball to take place provided that
RCSU undertakes to clear up
afterwards, that ICU helps in the
organisation and that there is
more satisfactory communica-
tion between RCSU and Silwood
Park Committee.
Yecfi/-Dirty old Mooncy
The appalling state of the servery adjoining the Union Dining Hall was
recently brought to the attention of FELIX. Dirty food containers,
several part full of mouldy food, were discovered and are pictured above
(although the black and white photo doesn't do justice to the vivid colours
of the mould). The floor is covered with rubbish and several large puddles,
with filthy shelves holding rock-hard bread rolls and old food. There is a
pervading smell of decay. The servery is used whenever dinners are held in
the UDH and, although the food is prepared elsewhere, the disgusting
state of this food serving area must raise serious questions about Mr
Mooney's standards of hygiene in his other refectories.
