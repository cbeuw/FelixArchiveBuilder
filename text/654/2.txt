Coffee
Come Home
Dear Pallab
Many of your new readers
will be unaware of the sad story
of the Biology Common Room.
The Common Room was open
every morning and afternoon
and served very reasonably
priced cups of tea and coffee to
membeA of the Biology De-
partment, although many
others frequently used it. It was
extremely popular and served
as a meeting place for staff and
students alike.
However, one fateful after-
noon the coffee service was
closed due to staff sickness. It
stayed closed for the remainder
of last year due to a series of
problems principally concern-
ing staffing. Eight months later
it is still shut. This is despite the
presentation to the Head of the
Biology Department of a peti-
tion of over 200 names asking
that the coffee service be re-
opened as a matter of urgency.
Although individuals on the
Departmental staff have de-
voted a great deal of time and
effort to the matter, the Depart-
ment as a whole has still been
unable to find a solution to the
problem. Meanwhile an ,irre-
n uj

placeable part of College social
life has been lost.
Students in the Biology De-
partment have certainly not
forgotten their coffee service
and are very eager for it to be
reopened as soon as possible. In
the meantime we would very
much welcome a statement
from the Head of Department
explaining his plans for the
future of the coffee service.
Yours thirstily

Dear Pallab
I was shocked and dismayed
(!) to read Martin Attwell's
letter of last week. How could
he possibly describe Conserva-
tism as "outdated"? It is
Socialism which has reached a
r s-\ r* v
state of ideological bankruptcy.
What new ideas do the Left es-
pouse? Just the same stale old
diet of nationalisation, conform-
ity and rabid anti-Americanism.
• Oh! And a 'National Economic
Assessment' (oldest political
trick in the book—if you don't
have a workable policy, invent
an impressive name for it). We
need only look as far as France
to see that Socialism has failed
again, as it has always failed in
the past.
Mr Attwell seems to think
that Consoc is remiss in being
more interested in having par-
ties, listening to speakers, going
on theatre trips and generally
enjoying ourselves than in
putting motions on Nicaragua
or South Africa to UGMs and
boring everybody rigid. Such
motions have no relevance to
students, and it should there-
fore come as no surprise that
they are not interested in them.
Surely there are many issues
within the College that would
be better subjects for debate
(for instance the state of student
accomodation, refectories etc).
On a lighter note, I am
delighted that our badges are so
famous. We have a wide
selection, all very reasonably
priced, and posters too! If you
want one, get in touch with us
via the SCC rack in the Union
Office!
Yours right-of-centre

PS: What is a 'coordinate
campaign'? Is it a Cartesian
Cause or a Polar Plot?
Absolute
Power
It is inevitable that those
people in power will make
decisions which are advanta-
geous to both themselves and
their friends but it is to be hoped
that the Union Office will be
more subtle in future since
Gaynor Lewis' receipt of a
parking permit, considering
that she lives in Linstead Hall,
indicates an all too obvious
persuit of self-interest.
