...To Eat or Not to Eat: Is That Your Question?
For those of you who are new
to College life at IC, let me
introduce you to the various
refectory outlets around the
campus, with the following list of
opening times and a resume of
services provided. For those of
you who have returned to IC for
yet another academic year, I
should like to point out some of
the new innovations to be found
in the refectories this year:
Refectories
Firstly, the JCR Buttery has been
completely refurbished over the
summer vacation. Even if it's not
one of your regular eating places,
we hope that curiosity will entice
you to visit the 'new' Buttery. A
greater choice awaits you at the
Sandwich Bar, including a vari-
ety of filled french bread rolls
(substantial enough to satisfy the
largest of appetites!).
For those of you who want a
quick, hot snack, the cafeteria in
the Union Lower Lounge is now
serving pitta bread filled with
beefburger and salad.
In the Southside Refectory, a
wider range of evening meals has
been proposed, with a new
'called-to-order' service from
5:30 to 6:30pm daily, for dishes
such as freshly cooked omelettes.
Southside Shop
All ICU regalia has now been
moved to the Walkway, Sher-
field, leaving more room in the
shop for extra consumables and
hardware, such as kettles, for the
'self-caterers' amongst you. It is
also envisaged that longer open-
ing hours may be introduced this
year. Yes! Late-night shopping at
IC!
College Wines
Many ofyou may be unaware that
a large selection of table wines
and port may be purchased direct
from the Collge cellar at reason-
able cost. There's a variety of
both classical and less well-
known French and German
wines, as well as some American,
Spanish and Italian vino. If
you're looking for cheap plonk,
forget it; but, with a discount of
7'/2
% for six. or more bottles (of
any type), Common Room Claret
and Burgundies are excellent
value for money. Orders can be
placed with the Refectory Office,
Ground floor, Sherfield; price list
on application.

Have you eaten in a College refectory or bar this week? If not,
why? Is it the food? the service? the cost? or, what? Remember that
the refectories sited around the College'campus, are provided as a
Service for you. Consequently, if you are dissatisfied, don't bore
your colleagues with complaints, but make your grievances known
to us. The Suggestions and Complaints Committee is one of
several sub-committees of the College Refectory Committee (with
both staff and student representatives), which reports directly to
the Rector. Other sub-committees include the Shop, Bar and
Wine Committees.

College Dinners
These formal occasions are held,
once a term in the Sherfield
Dining Hall. Any member of the
College and their guests may
attend, so why not treat yourself?
your tutor? your supervisor?
or...whoever! Students may book
in the ICU Office, and staff with
Mrs E M Finlayson, Room 508
Sherfield.
In conclusion, let me empha-
sise that, if you do have any
comments (complimentary or
otherwise!) concerning the food
outlets in College, please voice
your opinions to us. There's a
Suggestions and Complaints box
in each refectory, and regular
committee meetings ensure that
any problems are promptly dealt
with. However...if your hot dish
is cold, or your meat pie, empty,
why go hungry? These are the
type of problems which can
(usually) be sorted out immedi-
ately. Try a quiet word in the
cashier's ear! If you are still
dissatisfied, contact us. Remem-
ber, be positive. These are your
refectories; if you don't like them,
then perhaps you'd like to tell us
why. We can't promise miracles,
but we'll do our best!
