Zelig (Warner West End) This
film underlines Woody Allen's
reputation as one of the finest
directors in the world. Zelig is a
technical masterpiece.
Allen has covered the themes
contained in Ze/ig many times
before, but this time he has
succeeded in making them inte-
gral with the plot—his themes
are less clumsily introduced and
so more hard-hitting when you
realise what he's trying to say.
Ze/ig is the totally faked docu-
mentary biography of a 'human
chameleon' who becomes a
world-wide celebrity in the 1920s
and 30s. There are clips of old
newsreel with Woody Allen
magically inserted, grainy home
movies, faked newspaper
cuttings and interviews with
supposed survivors of Zelig's era
and real life intellectuals like Saul
Bellow who provide false 'social
comment'. The care and detail
put into creating it all is over-
whelming, as is the cost: over
£20m for just 79 minutes of film.
Leonard Zelig is a second
generation Jewish immigrant and
like so many in the US (a nation
of immigrants) desperate to fit in,
be invisible. He has no identity,
no character to call his own, so
he has unconsciously become an
expert at mirroring other
people's personalities, both
physically and mentally.
Amongst rabbis he speaks Yid-
dish and grows a beard, amongst
negroes he turns black, with fat
men he grows a paunch. Zelig is
'discovered' and thrust into
stardom, as psychologist Mia
Farrow trys to cure him whilst
falling in love with him.
The jazz era is the perfect
setting for Allen to comment on
the meaningless distractions and
superficialities of American soci-
ety, and on the loneliness, fears
and personality traumas it can
cause.
Yet Allen knows that everyone
has occasionally wanted to be
like Zelig and fit in perfectly, so
the film is not just pretentious
sdfcial comment. He temporarily
cures Zelig, makes him 'normal',
saying you mustn't be all things
to all men, but be yourself.
The film, however, doesn't try
to force anything down your
throat. It is witty, technically
brilliant and a delight to watch,
having the rare ability to make
you laugh and make you think.
Woody Allen psychoanalysing psychoanalysts.
Merry Christmas Mr Law-
rence (on general release) is an
intruiging film. I was not looking
forward to it at first, suspecting a
one-man David Bowie show. But
Bowie has a fairly small role, in
terms of emotional impact.
Although he tries too hard to be
meaningful and profound in
every line he speaks, he makes a
reasonable job of an embittered
soldier torn with guilt. Bowie
sticks out like a sore thumb from
the rest: he is so different, too
different, and is best in the more
surreal scenes of the film, out on ,
his own.
The film portrays the brutal life
of a Japanese P O W camp, with
all the violently shifting emotions
of supposed enemies cooped up
together over a long time.
Lawrence, excellently played by
Tom Conti, tries to mediate
between the Japanese and
British. But they are so different:
the former so passionate and
self-destructive, the latter either
pompous or jokey and cynical.
Bowie arrives, and everyone
changes. The best performance
is by Ryuichi Sakamoto, the
camp commandant who finds
himself falling in love with Bowie.
The Japanese do not like to think
themselves gay.
Violence occurs roughly every
five minutes, and ritual hara-kiri
every ten, until the film set is
covered with bodies. But despite
this Merry Christmas Mr Law-
rence is well worth seeing,
especially to hear the music by
Sakomoto. I was humming it all
the way home.
My Tutor is not worth the
celluloid it's filmed on. It's an
awful film. It's only value was to
make me realise how good Zelig
is. A 17-year-old male virgin has
to pass his exams, and a beautiful
French teacher (female) is hired..
....blah, blah, blah. Only go and
see it ii you are offered money, or
if you have multiple orgasms over
an occasional bare breast.
There's a nipple too.

Betrayal (at the Curzon St
Cinema) is an attempt to adapt a
Harold Pinter stage play onto
film. Unfortunately it shows.
Betrayal is very English, very
arty and not very cinematic.
The theme, as you might
expect, is betrayal: of other
people and of yourself. The story
analyses an affair between a wife
and her husband's best friend,
moving backwards in time from a
husband and wife punch-up in
1980 to 1972 when it all first fired
up. The people are a smart
Hampstead set—the literary sort
who watch films like Betrayal.
Pinter wants to show how the
English hide their feelings despite
often surging resentments
underneath, and how although
everyone knows what is going
on, they are more concerned
with keeping up appearances.
As a result the film concen-
trates almost exclusively on
character. The plot is rather thin
and the affair seems sordid, dull,
uncommitted—it is difficult to
sympathise with the characters.
This does not mean they are
uninteresting, because the acting
is superb. Ben Kingsley as the
betrayed and passionate hus-
band, cool brittle Patricia Hodge
and Jeremy Irons as her elegant
yet emotionally clumsy lover are
excellent character actors. They
know how to use Pinter's dia-
logue, which is taut, crisp and full
of nuances of speech, meaningful
pauses and so on. The acting is
pleasant to watch and to listen to.
The main problem with the film
is not the plot, with its gimmick of
'scenes' like acts in a play, which
gradually develop on the theme
of betrayal. It is the camera-work
that is wrong. Pinter's intense
close-up action is ideal for the.
stage and T V , but»film needs
more movement, a vlder sweep.
Director David Jones tries to
open out the play by lots of
standard exterior shots and
people getting in and out of cars.
The camera is a mere recorder,
and it looks ugly and clumsy at
times. There is one ghastly scene
in a pub, with the camera shifting
continually from one talking head
to the next, back and forth, like
watching a tennis match.
If you ignore the occasional
bad camera-shot and concen-
trate on the script and the acting,
Betrayal always keeps you inter-
ested in what happens next (or
what happened before). The arty
intelligensia it portrays are not
particularly nice people, so you
end up watching it quite dispas- t
sionately. Like Ian McEwan's
The Ploughman's Lunch,
Betrayal is essentially a
comment on 'how we live now'.
