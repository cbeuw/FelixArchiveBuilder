SINGING A C T .
1983 has been a remarkable year for
reviving old songs, usually with great
commercial success but a reaction from
critics and artists which is aptly summed
up by Carmel's comments on Wherever I
lay my hat: "What can you say but you
prefer the original."
However covering a musical style or
era lock, stock and barrel generally
reaps the opposite results. Tom Waits
and Ry Cooder have been producing
quality albumns for as long as I remem-
ber without ever threatening to deplete
world vinyl stocks due to their sales.
Now let me introduce the Chevalier
Brothers who have a distinct advantage.
In this country at least, they have been
gigging solidly for almost two years—
they started by busking at the markets in
Portobello, Camden and Covent
Garden, moving on to the pub circuit and
now they are venturing into prestige ven-
ues like Dingwalls. It is not clear into
which of these categories Imperial
College fits. The band have received a
universal thumps-up from the critics and
were one of the bands chosen by the
NME to play at that paper's night during
the ICA's press gang week.
' Currently the band has five members:
Maurice Chevalier (yeah?) on guitar,
Raymondo Gelato on saxophone, Roger
on vibraphones (metal xylophones) and
the rhythm section of Clark Kent on
double bass (yeah, yeah?) and Pete
Fairclough on drums. They all wear zoot
suits, braces and terrible ties whilst belt-
ing out some superb 40s Jump Jive.
Maurice's guitar playing ranges from the
tight sound of Django Reinhardt thru to
s o m e w o n d e r f u l 'fat' c h o r d s a n d
rock'n'roll runs, whilst Raymondo's sax
playing is totally different from the
sound we have become accustomed to
hearing in the past five years—he just
blows and does it sound good. The
rhythm section is tight having discarded
the gimmicky tea-chest bass although
Maurice and Raymondo
FELIX
vibraphone solos are so unique that I
don't think I've ever heard one before.
The band cite Louis Jordpn, Count
Basie, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton
and Benny G o o d m a n as influences—
artists whose names are well-known but
whom I've always associated with those
awful big bands featured regularly on
Radio 2 and hence occupy little space in
most students' record collections, but
their music is neither aimed at Jimmy
Young/Terry Wogan land or 40s jazz
purists; it mixes rhythm'n'blues, jive and
swing in with the jazz to form a highly
enjoyable and danceable mixture and it
isn't very serious or highbrow—take the
lyrics of the superb set-opener Three
Handed Woman for instance: "She's
right handed, left handed, and under-
handed too."
Other numbers include well-known
songs like Caledonia and Reet Petite and
also the hilarious Open the (closet) door
Richard.
The Chevalier Brothers are not for
e v e r y b o d y a l t h o u g h s e v e r e d o u b t s
could be expressed about anyone who
fails to tap a toe or swing a hip during
their set. If your taste extends beyond
any one type of music you'll enjoy them.

SINGLES
RADIO SILENCE - THE PRIMARY
(GOLD FISH)
Released on the College-based Goldfish
label Radio Silence is a remarkably
professional first single. The elaborate
production allows s c o p e for a wide
range of influences—unfortunate ones
like E L O rub shoulders with Louise's
excellent Souixsie sound-alike delivery.
Obviously written by the drummer and
keyboad player (the bass and guitar
hardly get a look in) it rocks along
nicely—the keyboards are really quite
good although the drummer hasn't fully
mastered the song's many changes of
pace. For further information contact
Pete Skelly, Chem Eng 3.
REVENGE-THE GENTS (POSH)
The Gents are a group of angry young
men drawing parallels between the
murder of a young man who beat some
small-time hoods at poker fifty years ago
and the treatment they've received from
record companies. The song starts with
a piano riff (like the one in Kim Wilde's
View from a Bridge) which is repeated
through the song and this coupled with
rasping vocals and Lizzy-like guitar
sound makes for a fine record spoiled
only by double-tracked vocals on the
chorus—Revenge is sweet—which is too
smooth for the questionable motive of
revenge which the song advocates.
THE CAPTAINS AND THE KINGS
-PHILIP CHEVRON (IMP)
The second release on Costello's pet
project label IMP delivers another attack
on British history and social values.
Lyrically only poking fun at the English
upper class and the playing fields of
Eton the song is not a diatribe like Pills
and Soap and its string quartet and cor
anglais (nice touch) make it sound more
like a B B C period drama theme tune
than the latest from Philip Chevron,
former leader of excellent Irish punk
outfit the Radiators. The Captains and
Kings is a truly remarkable and different
record and even if it didn't involve three
of the artists I respect the most (Costello,
C h e v r o n and the s o n g ' s c o m p o s e r
Brendan Behan) the B-side, Faithful
Departed, would still make it an essential
purchase.
