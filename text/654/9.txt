What do you
Say before you
Say Goodbye
Mikki lies in bed telling her teddy bear of a
young bear who, seeking honey, only gets
stung by bees. And the play tells the story of
how Mikki seeks her pot of honey (in the
form of a lasting relationship) only to be stung
and it is her quest that provides a most
amusing hour's entertainment.
Mikki, Billie and Tom are three characters
living in Ohio in the present day. Mikki is a
potter, reasonably ambitious and in need of
that elusive, lasting affair. Billie is a junior
executive, on the way up the ladder of suc-
cess who is also in need of a lasting relation-
ship, so their meeting at a disco inevitably
leads to friendship and love. Yet, as the play
develops, Billie's confidence is seen to be a
veil covering his sexual inadequacy and his
need for psychoanalysis. So Mikki discovers
Tom and the resulting actions and reactions
of the protagonists provide the basis of the
play.
Much of the humour derives of the verbal
interplay between these characters and the
jargon used by them. Such phrases as "I
think I'm going through a revirgination", "and
to the world I'm just an unemployed social
worker" and even Billie's statement "I think
that I'll kill myself" cause laughter through
the inherent nature of jargon and the excel-
lent delivery of the cast. The production
avoids overplaying the lines and lets their
intrinsic humour do the work resulting in a
sympathetic and warm response from the
audience. The jokes directed against
Americans and the obsession with psycho-
therapy are not overstated, so that even a
hardened American patriot can laugh with-
out feeling guilty.
The acting of all of the three of the cast is of
a high standard. Nikki Scott portrays Mikki's
desire for independence, coupled with her
need for love, with skill and conviction. The
portrayal of Billie (by Mike Bridgeland) is no
less skilful as an initially precocious, shallow
character is both apt and well performed with
Billie's insecurities becoming apparent as the
play develops. Dave Simmon's characterisa-
tion of the macho, experienced Tom is no
less appropriate with Tom's fear of a com-
mitting, lasting relationship indicating his in-
securities.
The show and the script are not without
their faults. The script drifts into areas that
cause embarrassment to the audience—
albeit for a very short time—and the script is
somewhat shallow in its characterisations.
Also, as ever with amateur actors, the
American accents prove something of a
stumbling point althoug this destracts little
from the humour it is occasionally annoying.
However, beyond these somewhat minor
factors, the play is very well performed with a
part of the somewhat monolithic Union
Concert Hall having been transformed into
an appropriately intimate theatre, providing
an excellent venue.
What Do You Say Before You Say Good-
bye is being performed tonight, having orig-
inally being performed by Dramsoc at 1983
Edinburgh Fringe Festival where it was very
well recieved, and tonight's performance at
8:00pm in the Concert Hall is thoroughly
recommended. Entrance is £1 on the door.
