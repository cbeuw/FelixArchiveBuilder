We did go to the moon - part II
Apparently some of you were not satisfied with
my previous article debunking the various
moon hoax theories. That article was mainly
based around the photographic "evidence" that
we did not go to the moon. In this article I will
look at some of the other "proofs" that we
could not have been there. I will start by look-
ing at some of the theories surrounding lunar
dust.
One of the commonly asked questions is
"why doesn't the dust stay in the air longer
than on the Earth? Surely with the lower grav-
ity it would float around for ages?"
On the moon there is a vacuum and dust
does not float in a vacuum - it will fall very
quickly. On Earth the atmosphere causes dust
to blow around despite the stronger gravity,
because an atmosphere has a stronger effect
on the motion of dust than gravity. There is
nowhere on Earth where dust could behave
this way, so the film of the lunar landing could
not be faked on Earth.
Another question often asked is "why does
the dust clump together like wet sand?
Everybody has seen the pictures of the astro-
nauts' footprints but should the dust have left
any trace of the footprints? Would they not
have disappeared like footprints in dry sand
dunes?"
Lunar dust particles have not been subject to
weathering processes like they would be on
Earth, so they are smaller and more irregular.
They are a product of asteroid collisions and so
are tiny jagged shards of broken rock that have
not been smoothed off because there is no
"weather" on the moon. As a result they would
not have been compressed by the boots of the
astronauts. Instead they gripped together and
Lunar footprint - why does it look like it was
made in wet sand?
retained their shape, hence the "wet sand"
appearance of the footprints.
Now I will discuss supposedly the most con-
vincing argument of the moon hoax theorists -
that of the Van Allen radiation belt: "The Van
Allen belts are a band of concentrated radia-
tion around the Earth. It's been estimated that
you'd need a foot of lead casing to protect
yourself from this, which the Apollo crafts did-
n't have. Why didn't this kill the astronauts on
the way to the moon?"
The Van Allen radiation belt concentrates
radiation in space to surround the Earth and
the Apollo crafts had to go through this belt
and could not take the weight of all the lead
shielding with them. So yes the astronauts
were exposed to radiation, but how serious
was this exposure?
Calculations show that travelling through the
Van Allen belt would expose astronauts to 1
rem of radiation. It takes 25 rem for a person
to exhibit symptoms of radiation sickness and
100 rem before they get really ill, so the Apollo
astronauts had a pretty mild dose. They con-
sidered that the experience of going to the
moon was worth taking a risk for. However it is
true that the issues related to radiation will
have to be solved before any attempts at long
term space travel are made.
Hopefully even the more sceptical of you are
now convinced that we did go to the moon. I
invite any "unbelievers" to write a convincing
scientific article to go in these pages, if you still
think that I am wrong.

#3 George P Thomson (1892 -1975)
George Paget Thomson was the
son of the famous Physicist and
Nobel Prize winner Sir J J
Thomson, who discovered the
electron. George was born in
Cambridge in 1892, where his
father was Professor of Physics at
the university. He later graduated
from Trinity College, Cambridge,
and immediately went to work for
his father until war broke out in
1914.
During the First World War
George worked mainly on prob-
lems related to aircraft stability for
various institutions. When the war
ended he briefly was a Fellow and
Lecturer of Corpus Christi College
in Cambridge before being
appointed Professor of Natural
Philosophy at the University of
Aberdeen, where he stayed for
eight years. During his time in
Scotland George
Thomson carried
out work on the
behaviour of
electrons inci-
dent on thin
metal films. It
was this work,
which showed
that electrons
could exhibit
wave like behav-
iour as well as
particle behav-
iour, that earned
him a Nobel
Prize in Physics,
jointly with C J
Davisson of the Bell Telephone
Laboratories. It is ironic, perhaps,
that J J Thomson received a Nobel
Prize for saying that the electron
was a particle, whereas his son
received a Nobel
Prize for saying
that the electron
was a wave.
Thomson was
appointed a
Professor at
Imperial College
in 1930, where
he stayed until
1952 when he
went back to
Corpus Christi
college until his
retirement in
1962. At
I m p e r i a l
Thomson worked
on nuclear physics and after the
discovery of uranium fission in
1939 he started to carry out
experiments researching into its
military applications.
After war broke out again
Thomson went to work for the
Royal Aircraft establishment and
then was made chairman of the
British Committee investigating
into the possibility of an atomic
bomb. The committee established
that a bomb was possible and
Thomson went to work as
Scientific Liaison officer at Ottawa
where he kept in touch with the
American atomic bomb research.
After the war Thomson worked
at Imperial doing theoretical
research into obtaining nuclear
power from deuterium. This work
was concluded at the Associated
Electrical Industry's Research
Laboratories where Thomson
became a consultant.
