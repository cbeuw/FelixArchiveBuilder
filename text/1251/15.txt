My Computer
The Monarch
3/5
The Monarch at Camden is a
great place for indie music. The
little venue of Camden began to
be fill with a crowd of fans,
friends and curious people.
The four members seemed to
do their best in their allocated
time, 45 minutes and not
more...It was impressive to see
the crew of the Monarch change
the stage between two sets.
Bands helped them and you saw
all that people plugging key-
boards, trying to get their gui-
tar... It seemed to be done with-
out organisation but it was effi-
cient! And here were My
Computer on stage. Not less
than seven keyboards, a drum
and guitars: the combo couldn't
move, there was no space left.
I only knew one track from
the band, which was released,
on a HMV playlist this summer.
Moreover I was curious to see
the band that some people com-
pare to Radiohead for the Kid
A/Amnesiac period.
It is true that the mix of elec-
tronica, vocoders, and strange
noises reminds you of
Radiohead. But at the same
time it is far from Radiohead!
However, we are quickly
entranced by this chilled music,
very peaceful, which is quite
unusual for the Monarch. The
singer is very focused on his job,
it is an important tour for the
promotion of their record
'Vulnerabilia'.
Perhaps they are too serious,
forgetting that they play live and
not in a studio...Obviously not
used to playing live, the band
just reproduce the album and
not more.
I was waiting for something
better but it's a new band we
have to leave them time. It was
a good concert music musically
but I regret that the band, didn't
make it something spectacular.

British Sea Power
93 Feet East
5/5
I am going to tell you about a
very strange evening...
All began when I arrived at the
93 feet east venue to see British
Sea Power. After a little queue at
the entrance, I listened to the
first band: 4 young guys on
stage who played a strong punk-
rock closer of the Sex Pistols
than Blink 182. I am not a fan
of this kind of music but they
seem to made the concert of
their life, jumping around the
stage, giving their all, whereas
there was nobody in the place.
After this, I was waiting for
something similar for the second
band called Florida. Not at all, I
was firstly surprised to see a
Yamaha keyboard on an iron
table with plastic tulip lights. It
was a totally different atmos-
phere than the former band...
And it began 2 boys and a girl
who was performing in front a
half-full venue. It is hard to
describe the style of music: per-
haps a kind of easy listening.
Sometimes CD flew over the
spectators or the singer stopped
his song to dance with the girl at
the keyboard... It was an unusu-
al performance for sure and it
was nothing compared to the
next band! At ten, 93 feet east
crews started to prepare the
stage for British Sea Power,
they placed some bits of tree,
foliage, plastic owls and herons.
I thought I was in a forest
because of the smell of fresh cut
trees.
Suddenly, they cut off the light
and a communique introduced
the band: "once placed upon the
concert stage they are remark-
able in their actions - quick of
foot and unafraid in their move-
ments." Strange, isn't it?
And five guys arrived dressed
in quasi-military uniforms, there
were the four members: Yan on
vocals and guitar his brother
Hamilton on bass, Noble on gui-
tar and Wood on drums plus an
other guy who engaged songs
with "hubbubs".
British Sea Power plays indie-
rock music with heavy guitar
and drums. It sounds good and I
spent great time to see them.
But I think I will long remember
the end of the concert: the band
began to fight with the bits of
tree, one guy on a loudspeaker,
Hamilton on shoulders of his
brother fighting with Noble and
Wood who continued to play
despite the chaos around him. I
had never seen such a disaster
after a gig. The stage was total-
ly destroyed, everything was at
the wrong place: the plastic
heron on the drums, foliage
everywhere and guitars among
bits of tree.
In conclusion, even if you
don't like this style of music, you
have to see British Sea Power
live because they have an atten-
tion to details and a big sense of
show.

This record is comedy genius. If
there is any justice in the world,
this will be Christmas number 1
this year. What is this musical
epiphany? I hear you cry. Well.
To try and explain, these are
a couple of Northern lads, who
state PJ and Duncan as huge
influences on their work. They
are pioneers of 'scumpop'
which is, in their own words
'pop music made by Northern
Scum for Northern Scum.' Oh
yeah, and it features Glen
Campbell. Only the most
severely depressed students will
not have a giggle at this. Buy it
now.

Mew - She Came Home Fo,
Christmas
Such is the blissed-out nature
of acts from Scandanavia, you
sometimes wonder if the peo-
ple there really are living in a
Utopian state. From Royksopp
to Kings Of Convenience and
Soundtrack Of Our Lives to
Sigur Ros; all the bands seem
to produce music which you
aspire to live your life to. I have
to report that Mew have noth-
ing to do with either Pokemon
or the keyboardist from
Elastica. Instead, this seasonal
offering gives a nod to '60s
west coast bands along with
the melancholy of Smashing
Pumpkins and REM.
The jarring point is the shaky
baritone vocals it uneasily
mixes with a sparse backing
and confused lyrics of lost love.
From this song, you sense they
don't quite have the eye for a
tune like their peers, although
a few more listens allows this
strange cacophony to gel.
After a spell in hibernation,
let's hope these creatures
come back with something to
roar about!
