To Clarify-
Dear Felix,
I am writing about the article
"DramSoc Disciplined" published
in last week's issue. I would like to
note that there are a number of
inaccuracies that must be clari-
fied. DramSoc were not disci-
plined and there is no suggestion
that the society has broken any
Health ad Safety procedures.
The Union called a disciplinary
hearing against two students in
light of an alleged breach of a
Health and Safety directive. The
matter was dealt with by the
Union Disciplinary Committee and
has now been resolved. I would
like to emphasise the Union con-
tinues to work with all our clubs
and societies to ensure that we
provide a safe working environ-
ment for all our members and I
hope this clarifies the situation.
Yours truly,
Sen Ganesh, Union President
Broadly Speaking
I would like to congratulate Paul
Kirk (Maths III) for all his excellent
work on the Broadsheet maga-
zine. He's worked so hard to sin-
gle-handedly produce all issues so
far this year, and I think he
deserves recognition and credit for
this. Well done Paul, keep up the
good work!

Dear Felix,
I find it disappointing that you
seem to condone the hacking that
wrecked last year's LEQ's. I am
sure that people realise that these
surveys are meant to improve the
lecturing and general level of
teaching, seeing if the lecturers
are any good and hopefully doing
something about it when they are
not. I therefore see no point in
spending time and money on
making the LEQ's completely safe
and geeky hack proof. My reason-
ing is that no-one outside Imperial
gives a shit about our LEQs, they
prefer more challenging and inter-
esting targets. Also Imperial stu-
dents, rather than priding them-
selves on proving how good their
hacking is against poorly defended
targets, should be filling the forms
in instead. If I knew who these
hackers were I'd round up some
mates and kick some civic sense
into them.
Lessons in Laotian required locally!
Is there a student from Laos who would be prepared to give
language lessons to a local businessman?
He travels there from time to time and would like to keep up with
the language - lessons would, of course, be paid for!
