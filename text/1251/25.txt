Novice Success Senior Victory
Last weekend IC entering three
new-novice crews into the Allom
Cup. The senior crews were hav-
ing their hair done and so unavail-
able for the other divisions.
With atrocious rain soaking
everyone in the morning heats,
the women's eight terrified their
opposition into a no-show, but the
long, cold and wet wait nearly
caused hypothermia all round.
However, dried up and warmed
up, they did actually have to do
some rowing in the afternoon.
They followed last week's success
in Cambridge with a convincing
win in the semi-final and then
delivered an assured performance
in the shortened final to beat UCL
comfortably.
The men's 'B' team were forced
to stop half-way after an unlucky
incident in their heat. They did,
however, stay to support the other
two crews - mostly from the bar! -
which was greatly appreciated.
On the other hand, the men's 'A'
team were indomitable. After a
mismatch, their quarter-final was
against St George's. A calm start
with a good rhythm left them as a
small speck on the horizon to the
opposition by the finish line and
with a feeling it wouldn't be so
trivial next time. Without a change
of kit or food the team spent time
warming bits of themselves under
the one hand dryer in the chang-
ing rooms during the lunch break
(with Russell concentrating on the
important parts). Meanwhile, hot
tea and coffee from Bill and Ian
prevented pneumonia.
The next phase of the after-
noon's racing was against a good
UCL team, who made a frenzied
start but wore themselves out by
the halfway mark and were then
only able to chase the IC steam-
roller that cruised on to victory.
This was effectively the final, as
the 'real' final was against ICSM.
Enough said. Threatened with
expulsion from IC boat club if they
lost to medics, the team rose
admirably to the occasion, demor-
alising their opposition with a
dominant lead before the halfway
mark and then cruising to the fin-
ish, again winning 'easily'. Cue
medals for both the winning
crews, and a few drinks.

Controversy surrounded the Boat
Club's first win of the new season
in the Fuller's Fours Head of the
River.
George Whittaker, George
Adams, JF John Weale, and cox
Seb Pearce won the men's senior 2
coxed fours pennant after the lead-
ers, Reading, were disqualified
because the crew who won were
not the crew registered and so put
Imperial on top.
The men's senior 1 quadruple
scull comprising Hugh McKenzie,
Derek Holland, Kieran West and
Dan Ouseley raced hard to attain
5th place overall and maintain
Imperial's place in the top 10.
Further medals were picked up
at the British Indoor Rowing
Championships. Thousands of
rowers worldwide flocked to
Birmingham to race on rowing
machines over 2000 metres.
Kelly Cummins of Imperial won
gold in the BUSA women's open
lightweight category. Helen Ellison,
raced in the BUSA women's under-
23 lightweight category and won
bronze. Ellison started strongly,
and had a good finish to keep her-
self a clear 2.4 seconds inside the
bronze.
Dan Ouseley, came 9th in the
men's open heavyweight category.
This event was stacked with inter-
nationals, with the top 10 compris-
ing solely of national rowers.
Ouseley was also the 3rd ranked
British athlete.
In the team event, Toby Wallace,
Ed Johnson, Robin Nicholson,
Andy Wilkinson, Ouseley,
Whittaker, McKenzie and Fox
ensured IC 3rd place in the
University rankings.
The Scullers Head of the River
took place on Saturday. This event
saw 459 single scullers battle it
out on the tideway. Helen Ellison
won the senior 2 lightweight
women's pennant.
Derek Holland came 4th overall
and Toby Wallace produced a
strong performance to achieve 2nd
in men's senior 3 category.
These results mark a good start
to the season for new chief coach
Simon Dennis. He has now taken
over the helm from Bill Mason who
recently retired from full-time
coaching at Imperial after 22 years
