King Adora
The Marquee, Islington
5/5
As soon as you step off the tube,
you can tell it's bad. Camden (the
Indie Vegas) is a shithole, but it's
a good, honest to god, shithole.
Islington looks like it's been made
out of candy. Neon facades of
tasteless yet boring boutiques and
twee, overpriced restaurants line
the streets of this once bohemian
locale. We pass the Screen on the
Green, 'Bowling for Columbine' is
showing: The thought of running
amok through the surburban
streets, pumping round after
round of semi-automatic fire into
the Slug and Lettuce until the floor
is piled high with a bloodied mass
of casually understated corpses
seems extremely appealing right
now, but alas, we're already late
for the gig.
The Marquee Club was the hip
dive where, to the amphetamine
anthems of the Yardbirds, the
Stones and most notably, the
Who, brutal battles were fought
on the dance floor between mods
and rockers. Two viciously sharp
armies of pilled-up kids with noth-
ing to lose who lived and died for
their clothes, their rides and their
music. Now it's in a shopping cen-
tre. A FUCKING SHOPPING
CENTRE! It's in between Next and
Monsoon. Now, the only possible
advantage I can see to this is that
hoards of drunken teens will
maybe pour out of some gig and
lay waste to the lame and tepid
pieces of shit that pass for style
and fashion in this sanitised hell-
holes of a shrink-wrapped 'mar-
ket', typifying of the turd that
North London is becoming.
The inside of the club isn't any
better: when we enter, they're
playing Gorillaz. Fucking Gorillaz.
Clinical, brightly lit hallways and a
slick soulless live room which
resembles a cross between a hip
minimalist bar and your school
disco. A bunch of be-mulleted
indie kids are play fighting, WWF
style. Compared to outside, it's
danger and excitement.
So what of King Adora then?
Their first gig in ages, God it feels
good to have them back. Like a
temper tantrum throwing neurotic
teen, who doesn't know whether
to tear himself to pieces or go out
and party, then plumps for both,
King Adora's filthy glamour is
overblown and preposterous, yet
life-affirming. All the new songs
sound just like the old songs, but
that's all right, coz all of King
Adora's old songs were fucking
cool. The Law', possibly the only
song to mix Chaz'n'Dave and the
Manics opens. 'Big Isn't
Beautiful' - a piss-take song about
a male anorexic - I was doing
press-ups to this song in the
morning, how post-modernist is
that for you, trendies? Art imitat-
ing life, or life imitating art? King
Adora - a ray of sunshine in a
world of shit (that's London N l ,
incase you hadn't guessed).
Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo
Gemma Hayes and Suede
Shepherd's Bush Empire
3/5
The Empire is a really good gig
venue, the acoustics are good
and everyone can see the bands.
I say this because I've heard
that the powers that be want it
shut down. This should not hap-
pen. Damn the Man, Save the
Empire.
Now the minor protest is over
with, I can mention the nights
popular music offerings. First up
was Gemma Hayes. She is very
slight, with messy blond hair
and seemed to be slightly
swamped by her electric guitar.
When she started singing
though, she sounded like a star.
The best way to describe the set
is rock songs sung by a folk
singer. Her voice was sometimes
half hidden by the guitars and
the music kind of swirled round
the venue.
Her live performance was
marred by a lack of interest from
a large portion of the audience,
who chatted loudly through even
the quietest songs. I doubt that
the gig will go done as a
favourite in Gemma Hayes'
memory. It was however, a
pleasure to be there.
When I chatted to some of my
mates about Suede I got two
main responses:-
1) Haven't they split up?
2) Who are they?
Anyway, they are still around,
and in fact have a new album
out. This has prompted a tour,
reminding everyone who they
are.
The set was perfect. Suede
are not the kind of band to play
their entire new album and
annoy the hell out everyone who
just wanted to hear the old
songs. They played 'Animal
Nitrate', 'She's In Fashion',
'Everything Will Flow',
'Beautiful Ones' the hits just
kept coming.
Brett was the consummate
professional front man, the
crowd were expertly coaxed into
singing along. An excellent
reminder of who Suede are, and
why they are still around.

Albums
The Used - The Used
As the name suggests The
Used is a compilation of
rehashed second-hand tracks.
The LP has that non-too rare
characteristic of being over
styled melodrama in a semi
metal wrapping. Targeted well
at the thirteen year old who
have yet grown the ability to
recognise a tune, it serves its
purpose immaculately. If the
band can ever get passed the
fact they sound like an Early
Incubus rip-off Warner Bothers
should be shifting millions of
these things.
The "poetic" lyrics are a
joke. My full admiration goes to
the man with the voice (Bert
McCracken) who seemingly
puts his full emotion into the
nasty words he wails. My
favourite would be:
"He feels alone
His heart in his hand
He's alone
He feels alone
I feel..."
Obviously real heartfelt bal-
ladry here, The Used kindly
publish all their lyrics in the
inlay cover and on the website
for the added humour of the
customer. This segment was
taken from the song "Poetic
Tragedy", which says more
about what we're dealing with
here than I ever could.
Interestingly enough there
are highlights to be found in
the folds of whining and feed-
back. "Greener with the
Scenery" has flashes of
melody, and John Feldmann
did excellently with the string
parts.
The rhythm section also dis-
played fragments of ability, and
indeed I sometimes found
myself tapping along and won-
dering how they would be if
they found themselves with
some decent songs.
