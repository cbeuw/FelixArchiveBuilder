IC Virgins I 10 - 14 Royal Vets
What a blinding match! We really
weren't sure what to expect from
this friendly, especially having lost
twice to the Vets last season.
The Virgins were a bit slow off the
mark, conceding two early tries, due
to crap tackling and a general lack
of with-it-ness. These were com-
bined with conversions by their Big
Fat Ugly prop, who was to be fair a
good kicker. For the rest of the
match, however, we held them back
and really took the game to them.
Our first try was off a penalty, with
Aoife passing it to Gemma who ran
blind through at least three tackles,
but was unable to sidestep the last
defender and off loaded the ball to
Aoife who put it down over the line.
The next try came in the second
half after a maul practically on their
try line. Ella - who was forward of
the match again - placed herself just
out of the mall waiting for the pop
pass. When it eventually came she
powered over the line to glory... oh
yes, there was much glory.
Our open play was good and flu-
ent, especially amongst the backs,
what with our ringer and all. If we
always played this well we'd be win-
ning our league hands down.
So, to the gossip. Ella, our blond
prop, who seems perfectly innocent
but is really a sly dog - you've got to
watch the quiet ones - crossed to
the dark side last week to pull a cer-
tain footballer. I'm informed he's
called Barry, and that he may be a
hand me down from the infamous
Aleks Corr, but who isn't these days?
Shiner number three of the sea-
son is worn by Gaffa Charlotte
'Muttley' Miller. Pre match frolicking
led to a knee in the cheekbone from
Spatchcock. To compound the
injury a ball came straight off their
fly half's boot into her face, causing
bruising and a bloody nose.
In order to raise their reputations
Ash has requested that she be
called Lush, and Dappy would like
to point out how beautiful she is.
You can't say we don't try!

IC II 6 - 0 Essex
Another outstanding performance
from the ladies seconds. We dom-
inated the game and ran rings
round the opposition. Our goalie
Ysanne only had to move three
times during the game: once to
save their one shot - when a rogue
ball dribbled into the D - once to
change ends at half time, and
once to leave at the end.
Jenny and Ana scored two of
our six fabulous goals in the first
half, but in the second we really
began to shine. A superb strike
from Ashleigh bounced off a
defenders foot and landed in the
goal. This was followed up by
Clare with a goal from the top of
the D, which was set up beauti-
fully by Kate. Marianne then
made a fast drive up the wing to
make it five nil, and then Ashleigh
finally took us up to six.
Well done to all the backs,
Sarah, Katherine, Belinda and
Brenda, who fielded back into our
goal end and saved Ysanne from
doing too much work.
Finally thanks to John and
Gibbo for gimping for us - cheers
guys.

True champions.
Thanks for all your reports this
term: we've printed every single
one that's been submitted - I
think - so keep them coming
next term.
I know there are far more
teams playing than there are
reports printed, so those of you
that aren't writing, get to it!

LSE I 10 - 23 IC I
Despite Mo's efforts to lead us
down the long and winding road
to Harlington, we all had suspi-
cious minds about the absence of
chunky Dune. So, two tribes go to
war, we all made sure not to look
back in anger at the ref who was
going slightly mad when he
thought that our coach was just
an over competitive dad. Jon's
charged down kick was followed
up by Bobby who ran like a bat
out of hell to score.
After sustained IC pressure, the
LSE flanker lost the plot and start-
ed kung fu fighting (but not quite
as fast as lightning). Fortunately
the ref was not colour blind and
showed him the yellow card. The
IC pack took full advantage of the
extra man and after pushing it...
pushing it real good, Enrico
crashed over in the corner. LSE
were knocked down but they got
back up again and scored a try
just before half-time to leave IC
with a slender 3 point advantage.
In the second half, with the
wind beneath our wings, we
searched for the heroes inside
ourselves and demonstrated
amazing defence. After some fan-
tastic running lines from the
backs, Mo drove over to touch
down for the very first time this
season. Despite Rich Waller's one
vision chip, the backs showed
true class and man-of-the-match,
Alex James weaved his way
through with pointed wings after
good hands from Mark and
Timplicity. Enrico, the dancing
queen, then scored his second try
to complete the rout.
Some might say we are simply
the best - except Will who wasn't
sure if we had won or not.
