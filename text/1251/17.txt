Monsters Of Rock
Wembley Arena
4 / 5
Never try and paint your nails on
the Metropolitan line: however
adept you may be, you'd have bet-
ter luck trying to do so while hav-
ing particularly violent, passionate
sex with someone three times
your size. However, if you ever get
the chance to go and see Alice
Cooper live, take it up: I can't
remember the last time that I left
a gig with a smile quite as wide as
the one that had spread across my
face by the time we staggered out
of Wembley Arena.
I arrived a fashionably late -
well, two hours late isn't too bad -
and so missed the first two sup-
port acts - the LA Guns and the
Quireboys - but if the third sup-
port act, Thunder were anything
to go by this was probably a very
good thing. The band did seem to
fit the aging rocker mould fairly
well, wearing black and having
dodgy mullets, but the entire
effect was ruined when the lead
singer minced on stage, looking
like in the intervening years
between now and their heyday
he'd settled down in Surbiton and
become an accountant. To make
things worse they sounded like the
mutant child of Chesnay Hawkes
and Jon Bon Jovi... as you can
imagine most of this set was spent
at the bar, in a vague attempt to
keep what little sanity I had left
nicely pickled and incapable of
escape.
Fortunately they didn't hang
around for too long, and we stag-
gered back into the Arena, still
clutching a few precautionary
pints, for The Coop'. He really did-
n't disappoint, and even made the
torture of the previous act worth-
while, which is no mean feat I can
assure you. To be fair, this wasn't
really a night of highbrow musical
appreciation: it was the musical
equivalent of a nice large lump of
extra mature cheddar: old and
cheesy, but really nice with crack-
ers. Maybe that's pushing the
metaphor a bit far, but I'm sure
you get the idea.
Alice Cooper may have been
doing this sort of thing for well
over 20 years, but he's not lost his
touch, and really does know how
to put on a show: at how many
other gigs are you likely to see the
vocalist be executed, resurrected
Frankenstein-style and then chase
Britney Spears off stage with a
huge axe as a finale? Poison was,
as expected, the highlight of the
evening... we were not disap-
pointed.
Straight after this gig, I went to
see Bomb 20, at Electrowerkz.
After seeing them about a year
ago, and loving it, but not having
heard much new material since
then I was really disappointed:
their edge had totally gone, and it
had drifted from proper evil noise
and Digital Hardcore into awful
quasi-industrial hip-hop.
Bastards.

Foo Fighters
Wembley Arena
This is the Foo's first arena tour
in the U.K, and as such they
have chosen their support care-
fully. Cave In certainly produce
some exquisite sounds from
their position on stage finishing
with a cover of Led Zepplin's
'Dazed and Confused', but the
standing crowd do nothing but
nod their heads - perhaps sav-
ing their energy for the main
event.
I'll be honest, this isn't the
first time I've seen the Foo
Fighters. It's not even the
fourth, so you'd be forgiven for
thinking I'd seen it all before.
However, I think Dave Grohl
himself said it best during a chat
with the spectators..."We try to
make every f***ing show differ-
ent". There is a considerable
amount of truth in this remark.
For a start off, I've never before
heard the alternate heavy metal
5/5
ending to 'My Hero', nor the
similarly crafted interlude during
'Stacked Actors'.
These are not the most
notable pointers towards Grohl's
time with Queens of the Stone
Age though. In fact if you closed
your eyes during renditions of
some of the new material you'd
be hard pushed to remember
you hadn't wandered into the
wrong venue...still, the Foo's
inimitable style gives it the hall-
marks of a classic Foo fighters
concert, complete with
grotesque belching into the
microphone.
In truth this is turning into
(another) very special Foo's con-
cert. They play a lot of older
tracks I've never heard live
before including 'Aurora' to kick
off the encore, along with the
new tracks such as 'The One',
'Times like These' and 'Tired'
which fit in effortlessly amongst
the familiar. The whole experi-
ence is one of the best gigs I've
been to.
And just if you thought it
couldn't get any better, 'Monkey
Wrench' kicks in and Dave goes
wondering. Not just down to the
barriers in front of the stage -
heck, that's been done before.
This time Dave pays a visit to
the multitude in the stalls.
Picking his way along he selects
a spot that towers over the mob
standing below, (also, conve-
niently, straight in front of where
I was sitting - I have the photos
to prove it) and serenades them.
The crowd seem to jump for
dear life to Grohl's every note..
So what if this was the fifth time
I've seen them? There's only one
thing to say when it come to the
Foo Fighters "/ won't go getting
tired of you". Alison
Athlete
Joel Pott, Carey Willetts, Steve
Roberts and Tim Wanstall - bet-
ter know to some as the delec-
table ATHLETE - are four
London lads bringing sunshine
to the masses.
Athlete have been working
hard this year radiantly filling
the support slots for the likes of
Mercury-nominated Electric
Soft Parade and the all-singing,
all-dancing, all-tunic-wearing
Polyphonic Spree.
The forthcoming album has
already been written and should
now have been mixed and oth-
erwise completed for its release
in a few months time. Their first
album release is something the
guys have been looking forward
to for three years and seem
more than eager to observe the
response. "Should be good,"
Willetts proudly grins, "having
our first album," and knowingly
smiles at his three band mates.
As their following grows,
Athlete find themselves in more
and more surreal situations.
Talking about their recent
appearance on Channel 5's
Pop, the group start to show
signs of cynicism regarding
today's media. "That was all a
bit strange cos we were miming
and everyone's told to cheer for
whoever's on. We went on to
the stage and everyone went
mad and we're like, "Hold on,
half of you don't even know
who we are!"" Other names in
the music industry certainly do.
Rock band A were at the same
television recording and dedi-
cated one of their songs to the
lads for "writing the best song
of the year so far." "And they
were right," Pott smirks; "Yeah
that was nice even if it [current
single Beautiful] was at num-
ber 41 that week. Yes!"
Athlete deserve all the praise
they get. They're a band who
want to dance in shop win-
dows and who respect those
dressed in tunics. They're here
to make us smile on grey
London days and damn they're
good at it. Keira
