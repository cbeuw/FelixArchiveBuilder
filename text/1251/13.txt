2002 - The Year of the Devil
Review of the Year
When BBC2 screen 'I Love 2002'
(it'll probably be on next week) no
doubt music will be represented
by Pop Idol. Perfect smiles and
saccharine ballads will be made
out to have been the flavour of
the year, but thankfully, true
music fans know that this vacu-
ous dirge was the low point in
what has been a year full of
delights; if you stay away from
the charts!
In terms of quality releases, the
year can be divided into new acts
and artists who made a success-
ful return. In the former, we saw
superb comebacks from Coldplay,
Doves, Idlewild, Feeder, Flaming
Lips, JJ72 and Delgados to name
but a few. Even David Bowie,
Oasis and Paul Weller showed
that they still had something to
offer.
The hype machine was mostly
spot on this year, with lots of
exciting new and young bands
arriving on the scene with partic-
ular mentions to The Music, The
Coral, TCTC, ESP, Datsuns,
James Yorkston and Polyphonic
Spree.
In the world of metal, QOTSA
finally lived up to their potential
to produce the monstrous 'Songs
For The Deaf whilst Foo
Fighters, Audioslave, A and Korn
also enjoyed success.
Dance fought back after a
somewhat barren 2001. Leading
the charge were the chilled-out
likes of Lemon Jelly, Boards Of
Canada and FC Kahuna, along
with Royksopp's Melody AM at
last getting its due rewards.
However, acts creating new
waves included My Computer,
Medicine8 and Faultline, but
David Holmes and 808 State
showed that the old-timers still
had a few tricks up their sleeve.
Hip-hop saw sterling efforts
from Herbaliser, The Aspects,
Missy Elliot and Eminem (twice)
but we bid a sad farewell to The
Anti-Pop Consortium as well as
TLC and Run DMC after the
deaths of Lisa Lopez and Jam
Master Jay. Other bands splitting-
up included Miss Black America,
Snow Patrol and Regular Fries,
as well as us having possibly
seen the last of Pulp, Cornershop,
Six By Seven and Charlatans.
Weird goings-on included
Eminem's spat with Moby, Ozzy
Osbourne getting a family TV
show, the making of the new Blur
album and anything involving
Micheal Jackson.
However, it was Pop Stars that
gave us the musical highlight of
the year. Hearsay announcing
that they would be splitting up
because they were sick of being
called wankers by small children
on the street! Perhaps a sign that
people are tiring of production-
line puppets and want music with
some substance. Here ,we have
high hopes for 2003.

Boom Selection 2
3/5
Boom Selection? Boom Selection?
Imagine the look on this cynical
hack's face as he picks up this CD
- on the front there's two female
hands caressing a tattooed six
pack. The words "essential urban
soundtrack" are emblazoned
across the middle. One of the
tracks is called 'The G Spot'. One
thing's for sure, this is as far from
Mogwai as you could possibly get.
The things I'll do for Felix...but
it doesn't matter what type of
music you're into, Missy Elliot is
undeniably a genius, and any CD
that starts off with her inspired
new single, 'Work It' is a worth a
listen. Next up is the ubiquitous Ja
Rule, with his dance floor filler,
'Livin' It Up'. Black Twang make a
surprise but fantastic choice for
this compilation with 'So Rotten',
a true street anthem in the mould
of the Specials. I'm sure I'm not
the only one who thinks 'Nu Flow'
from Big Brovaz has become as
annoying as that Ketchup Song,
and so should be promptly
skipped over. 'Boogie 2Nite' by
Tweet and 'Word Love' by
Rhianna are noteworthy tracks;
Danni Minogue and Fabulous are
not. The latter half of CD1 turns
out to be very good with some
excellent drum 'n' bass and garage
cuts from Jammin', Klute, Po
Syndicate and Agent X, proving
the "urban soundtrack" can be
original and innovative.
CD2 is much better with artists
such as Shy FX and Holly Valance
alongside the Fugees, Jill Scott
and the always outstanding Wu
Tang Clan.
There is over three hours of
music - and fortunately there are
more than misses, and yes, there
certainly are some misses here -
see the remix of the Streets' 'Has
It Come to This?' - it's a dreary,
plodding dance track, wringing
the original completely of it's lyri-
cal genius. "Boom Selection 2" is
a decent compilation, not as origi-
nal as it could be, nor entirely
complete (Justin Timberlake and
Nelly are two significant missing
names). Anyway, this CD has
inspired me to give up my rock
star dreams, and make an attempt
to MC for Blazing Squad...Boooo!!

Kinesis - Billboard Beauty
It's only in recent times that
we've begun to experience early
Manic Street Preachers influ-
ences reaching new bands. Of
the more popular ones, King
Adora are purveyors of glitter
and sleaze, the sadly departed
Miss Black America mixed fero-
cious live sets with staunch pol-
itics and now Kinesis have
joined the fray with their spiky
guitar anthems and sneering
arrogance.
Like The Manics, the band
have claimed that they'll split
up after their first album. It
would be a huge pity if this is
anything to go by - A bile-filled
rant against the media for pro-
moting matchstick-thin models.
Whilst there are probably more
important things in the world to
be worrying about, you would-
n't believe it from the passion-
ate lyrics and rampant guitars
on a song with more bite than a
million Nickelbacks.
Although not as good as last
single 'Everything Destroys
Itself, this is a more than wor-
thy follow-up and proves
Kinesis are a band to watch out
for:
If they choose to hang
around!

Stag: Low Watt Glow/Money or
Your Life
Stag have released two promo-
tional songs in advance of some
singles to be released next year.
The first of the two is Low Watt
Glow.
If the aim of music is to trig-
ger an emotional response then
this song fails. It isn't even any
good for dancing to. The song is
also boring. More sort of aver-
age or uncharacterful.
Perhaps that is too harsh.
The lyrics aren't too bad, but
there doesn't seem to any mes-
sage to the listener. The rest of
it is ok. Robin
