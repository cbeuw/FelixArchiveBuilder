So, our final issue of term. It's kind of sad in a
way, because we're clearly not going to be able
to get you the Two Towers review that we were
looking forward to. We wanted to do an entire
four page spread on the Christmas TV movie
offerings. BUT NO!! You skiving undergraduates
all want to run off home for festive celebrations
or something. Bah humbug to the lot of you!
Semi-seriously though - we sincerely hope
that you've enjoyed (or at least been able to
bear) our mildly insane and incoherent ram-
blings, as well as our inept (but strangely com-
forting) take on movie reviews. We are still yet
to receive a single complimentary email, but
we'll forgive you - mainly because we haven't
received any derogatory ones either. So have
y'all a fine fun-filled holiday, a cracking new
year and best of luck in any exams you may
have. 'Till January folks!!
Si
Well here we are again, boys and girls...in the
immortal words of Slade, IT'S CHRISTMAS!!!
which is always fun. Or filled with pointless
presents you never wanted in the first place and
copious family arguments. Whatever. It is the
season of much drunkeness and crapness of TV.
Go forth, while away the hours between the
over consumption of food and sleep with terri-
ble films and cutsie Spielberg repeats. But don't
forget that the New Year is but a sparrow's spit
away, and we'll be back with a vengeance, irri-
tating you with our vitriolic spoutings and giving
you the chance to watch films for free. We are
still looking for writers, and hope to be adding
lots of fun new features, including competitions
and cool stuff like that. I know we've been say-
ing this for ages, but the Felix editorial meetings
have been slightly more traumatic and time-
consuming than we initially envisaged. Profuse
apologies and festive fuzzy thoughts.

Ah, Mr Adam Sandler. Not many men are
more hated by most film critics. As far as
they're concerned, he's the film equivalent of
S Club 7 - derivative, formulaic, unoriginal,
and most infuriatingly, he keeps raking the
money in. Must be those uneducated gutter
people who go to see his movies, because
anyone with a full complement of brain cells
would surely rather slide down a banister
lined with razor blades.
The thing is, in the right circumstances -
and I'm going out on a limb here - S Club 7
can actually be enjoyable, and not just
because Rachel is incredibly fit either. Sure,
I wouldn't confess to actually owning any of
their music, but if all you're after is a bit of a
drunken boogie, there's arguably not much
better. And such is the case with Mr Deeds.
Go to watch it expecting a profound, thought-
Mr Deeds, about to hit someone. You can
see it in his eyes
provoking experience, and you'll hate it. The
deepest thing you'll come out of the theatre
wondering is if Australian accents that bad
should carry the death penalty. However,
treat this film as a slice of light entertain-
ment and you might just enjoy yourself.
At this point, there would normally be a
brief plot summary, but the less said about
that the better, so let's just take the opening
scene. It starts with an octogenarian stand-
ing 100m from the summit of Everest, wear-
ing a coat and some goggles. A storm forces
his group to turn back, he continues alone,
and is later found frozen to the summit, from
which he is subsequently removed by heli-
copter. Now, you're all bright Imperial peo-
ple, so I don't need to point out the glaring
inconsistencies there. But who cares? As
long as it's funny - and it is in part this bla-
tant disregard of reality that makes you
chuckle. It's the Starship Troopers factor;
where something is so bad that it becomes
good. Don't get me wrong: some of the gags
err on the 'nul points' side of hit and miss,
and this isn't the new Austin Powers. If
you've seen The Waterboy or Happy Gilmore
you'll know that Sandler's brand of comedy
falls squarely within the slapstick bracket,
but there's nothing intrinsically wrong with
that. As long as you like goofy humour, that
is.
If there's one thing that this film will be
noted for when people look back on it, it will
probably be the return to the fold of Winona
Ryder, following her recent extra-curricular
exploits in court. It would be unfair to judge
her on a production where characterisation
and insightful dialogue are way down the list
of priorities, but she's certainly a cut above
the rest of the cast. Which is not saying
much. At all. But, hey - this is comedy, peo-
ple...
By no means the best movie of the year.
However, go with no expectations and you
may find yourself pleasantly entertained.
