F E L I X C O L U M N 03 AS'132?
And Alex Said...
Christmas is a-coming and I'll be
getting even fatter. I've dispensed
with the usual rubbish chocolate
advent calendar this year and built
my own. Behind every window is a
sausage roll, a mince pie, a small
bottle of whisky and a selection of
crisps.
You see, Christmas is a time for
gorging yourself into a stupor, and
the normal little chocolates would-
n't be enough to stretch my stom-
ach enough for Christmas dinner.
In the Middle Ages, Britons used
to consume so much food on
Christmas Day that their sleep
after lunch would last until March,
thereby omitting those crappy
months at the start of the year,
and handily in time to stock up on
Easter Eggs.
These days Christmas isn't half
as much fun. The trouble starts
with Christmas Shopping. The
shops have had festive stuff in
them since July - last year. So
many people take to Oxford Street
that the heat generated is enough
to form its own micro-climate,
which is probably why it's always
pissing with rain whenever I go.
The reason there's a McDonalds
every 200 yards is because, by the
time you've pushed your way
through 200 yards of people, it's
time for your next meal.
It's a hellish experience just
moving about, but then you've got
to try and find some presents. I'd
love to be able to buy my dad that
perfect gift, but I haven't got
enough money to buy Nicole
Kidman, so he'll have to make do
with another pair of Homer
Simpson socks. It's the thought
that counts.
If you're sensible, you'll have got
all your shopping out of the way by
the end of October, which means
all you have to do is look forward
to the big day. One thing you won't
be looking forward to, though, is
having relatives coming to stay.
We only narrowly avoided having
our elderly Aunty Mabel stay last
year, but the day before she was
due to come she ended up in hos-
pital after dropping the bumper
Christmas Radio Times on her
foot, completely flattening it, and
so I was spared receiving yet
another garish knitted jumper and
putting up with her funny smell.
Aunty Sue likes to think of her-
self as sensible. She likes to save
money by buying all her presents
in the January sales, and then hid-
ing them for the whole year in her
kitchen cupboards. Whenever we
visit her, it is a family tradition to
take a peek and try to guess who'll
get what - whoever gets the 2002
Cutesy Bunny Wabbits calendar
should find it serves them well for
the whole six days of 2002 which
remain after December 25th, but I
pity whoever gets the chocolate
Santa as it's probably going to be
past its best.
Hopefully this Christmas will be
quieter for our family. In previous
years, the Twatt family next door
have irritated the whole street with
over-enthusiastic carol singing at
all hours of day and night, and the
illuminations in their front garden
consisting of ten thousand flashing
lights. They were so bright I actu-
ally found it much easier to sleep
during the day, but fortunately last
year our prayers were answered
when a Boeing 747 landed on top
of their house.
It's now the time to get your
Christmas tree sorted, but as a
student you're not going to be able
to afford one to rival the one in
Trafalgar Square. Just use your
imagination. Last year in my room,
I cut the largest piece of green fun-
gus from some old bread I'd been
cultivating, and decorated it with
leftover meatballs and an assort-
ment of dead insects. It certainly
brought a bit of festive cheer to all
who saw it, even if it did smell like
a corpse.
So, that's the preparations sort-
ed. If you've managed to survive
the build-up, brace yourself for
Christmas morning. Last year, at
about 3am, I heard footsteps
downstairs, so I went down to see
what was going on. I found an old
man with a white beard, drinking
sherry and eating mince pies. I do
wish Uncle Pete wouldn't get up
so early and eat all the bloody
food. "I'm so excited I can't sleep!"
he said, as I wafted a chloroform-
soaked rag under his nose. I car-
ried him back up to his bed, and,
twelve months later, he's not
woken up yet.
Everybody loves opening their
presents on Christmas morning,
except for my brother - he's always
disappointed because he makes
such a colossal Christmas list.
When he was six years old, my
mother tried explaining to him that
Santa couldn't possibly bring a
Formula 1 racing car, a horse and
an Apache helicopter down the
chimney. At the age of 27, you'd
really think he'd have learned by
now.
By mid-November we've usually
just about finished off last year's
leftover turkey, so it's good to look
forward to Christmas dinner. In our
house we keep everything left over
from Christmas dinner until it's
eaten - we've still got some
Brussels sprouts from Christmas
1984, but hopefully they'll be off
to university soon and the
Christmas pudding from 1987 can
move into their bedroom.
After dinner, you can regale your
family with the same tired double-
entendres about "pulling crack-
ers". Well, anything to take the
pain away from the feeble
Christmas crackers themselves I
suppose. After exploding with a
noise about as loud as a mosqui-
to's heartbeat, out pops a feeble
hat, a deformed plastic frog and a
joke which has been badly trans-
lated from the original Japanese,
with all the wit of Bobby Davro.
"What do you call an Imperial
College rector on a bicycle? Sir
Richard Bikes!!"
After dinner, you can spend the
rest of Christmas Day watching
television. It's hard to tell the
repeats from the new shows usu-
ally - this year BBC1 is offering us
yet another new episode of Only
Fools and Horses. In this episode
Del Boy flogs a dead horse.
Then it's time for bed, and it will
be all over for another year.
