Imagine three naked men dripping in warm honey and cuddling a rub-
ber barn-owl, and whilst you're enjoying this, realise just how little it
has to do with the eccentricities of last week's crossword. After a little
Mailing, Felix has decided not to patent the Hypercrossword - a new
and innovative format where the words only fit the grid in another
dimension.
After extensive trial ling Felix has also decided not to patent Double
Entry. It's very simple, in fact a child could do it, but you shouldn't
make them. Every entry we receive will be worth two entries into the
grandprize tombola as a reward for tackling this behemoth of an early
Christmas present. I've lived and died for many years now, but frankly
writing this crossword seemed to take for all eternity, so if you could all
try your very, very best to solve it, I'll be one ecstatic corpse. Because
this crossword is just so extraordinarily special, it has an official dead-
line: 10am on Friday 10th January, although if you want your stagger-
ing intellect to be displayed to the world, you may wish to enter earli-
er so we can print your name. As always you can either email
coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk, or bring your completed grid down to the office
in Beit Quad West Wing basement. The winner of crossword 1250 is
Karen Osmond, DoC II. She didn't actually enter it, but when she does
send in her answers she includes cheerful comments, and that's rea-
son enough for me to let her win.
Moving on, it was nice to see Boris back last week after his little mis-
demeanour had been dragged through the press. I'm pleased to say
that Mrs B has now forgiven him, after sending him to visit the troll
under the bridge for some hefty punishment. They'll be spending
Christmas with the kids in the beautiful pastures of Somerset. Caesar
tells me that he will be wiling away the holiday polishing his armour,
or something. As for me, I'll be in the crypt with the Reverend. Happy
Christmas! Mummy H.
