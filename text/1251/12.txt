In my family, Christmas equals Trivial Pursuit,
resulting in many questions such as "how
come we are paying a fortune for your educa-
tion and you still know nothing?" So I thought
that a website to help improve general knowl-
edge would be a good idea. As such I bring to
you a general knowledge website. I enjoy pre-
tending to do crosswords and this website will
provide lots for you to tackle.
The clues are a combination of 'quick' (are
they ever actually quick or am I really thick?),
cryptic and general knowledge. The tea break
crosswords have answers that all begin with't'
'e' or 'a', and there are enormous crosswords
entitled 'the big X' - they are really inventive
with the whole naming things bit.
There are vast numbers of crosswords to
keep you entertained over Christmas. Once you
have finished this week's Felix cryptic cross-
word of course, but we wouldn't want you all
getting withdrawal symptoms over the holiday.
For those of you looking for something a little
less brain stretching there are word searches
and fill-ins.
So, with a little practice, maybe I will be safe
from my family's recriminations, as I actually
manage to answer something. I still maintain
that the ancient set we own does not contain
anything that happened after I was born.
Which explains why I know nothing. Well, it's
my story and I'm sticking to it.
Hope y'all enjoy the crosswords, they keep

Christmas is a time for love, a time to realise
that not everyone is as privileged as we are. It
is our responsibility as citizens of the Western
world to ensure that other benefit from the love
that we are capable of giving. It is because of
this that I am recommending this site. I do not
know what your opinions on the current situa-
tion in Iraq are or how you felt when we took
out Afghanistan but I think that at this time of
year we should show kindness to all mankind.
Instead of going out on pointless demonstra-
tions that the government ignores or signing
petitions that will end up in the bin, why don't
you try and spread a little love by masturbating
for peace. If we can all learn to love ourselves
then we can begin to love one another and
from this the world can becum a better place.
Currently this site has over seven thousand
petitions from sixty nine countries so go and
make yourself heard. If you need any help or
are particularly vigilant about this cause there
is a link to the viagra web site where the inter-
active order form makes ordering your aid
quick and easy. Let everyone else know how
you feel by putting a bumper sticker on the
back of your car.
Masturbation does not end with yourself,
why don't you help others in their bid to
increase the love in this world
Stop the wars, calm the terrorists by focus-
ing your self love on those who really need to
feel loved this Christmas.
Save our soldiers. Touch your privates.

No, this is not rude, don't be filthy. It is, in
fact, a chance for you to see the infamous
George Bush grooving on the dance floor.
Check out the main man performing the funky
chicken and the moonwalk. Then make him
do the whole lot in one go.
This is a must for all American Bush fans,
I'm sure that there are some out there. It kept
me amused for about ... that long. So I hope
you enjoy watching Bush make a tit of him-
self. Alternatively you could just switch the
television on.

few crosswords a good filling this Christmas.

T e r m o f t h e W e e k :
Modem
Short for modulator-demodulator it allows a
computor to transmit information through a
phone line. The modem can be a device or a
program, on-board or external, the on-board
fits into an expansion slot and for the exter-
nal there is a standard connection (RS-232).
The computer stores data digitally and the
telephone line transmits it in an analog for-
mat. The modem converts between the two
which is pretty darn important job and if it
wasn't there I would have nothing to write
about. Which you would probably say was a
good thing.

Christmas is a comin' and I'm gonna get
fat(ter). I hope everyone has started their
advent calendars and convinced their par-
ents that Santa is supposed to visit over
eighteens.
The first website this week should provide
a little mental exercise, I don't know about
you lot but that is the only kind of exercise I
get over Christmas.
Secondly, a website that tackles an impor-
tant issue which is particularly relevant at
this time of year. I hope you all take time to
ponder it's meaning this festive holiday.
Have a great holiday peeps. Jenny
