News In Brief
Apology
It would seem that the story on the
front page of last week's Felix
(1250) on DramSoc was slightly
more complicated than originally
reported. As such, it should be
pointed out that it was not DramSoc
who were disciplined, but two indi-
viduals (who are members of
DramSoc). Felix has also been cate-
gorically assured by both DramSoc
and the Ents team that reports of a
rift between them were untrue.
This episode has caused a fair
amount of trauma in the Union this
week, and the politics of the situa-
tion have confused even an old
Union hack such as the Felix editor.
Felix would like to apologise for any
misunderstanding caused.
Theft Or Mascotry?
On the evening of the 16th of
November the Chaps Club had a
very important historical item stolen

stressed that this item, an antique

silver-coated, three-handled pot, is
extremely valuable and totally irre-
placeable. They have asked that
those responsible return the item
immediately to the bar in the Union
and prevent this matter requiring
police involvement. There will be no
recriminations of any kind provided
the item is returned by the end of
this week. Any information regard-
ing this unfortunate incident should
be sent to douglas.smith@ic.ac.uk
SOLEs Update
Following last week's article, Felix
is happy to announce that the
SOLEs seem to be doing better
than this cynical newspaper had
expected. Although there have
been problems with the site not
working quite properly, and a few
course modules missing, most
students are very happy with their
opportunity to address lecturer
issues. Will
