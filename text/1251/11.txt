Jackass the movie - literally a load of bollocks.
And arses, cocks, tattoos, sick, beer...
If you've seen the tv series then you pretty
much have the gist of the film. Johnny Knoxville
takes a break from Hollywood schmoozing to
reunite the Jackass team, and lets them loose
doing what they always do but in a bigger, bet-
ter and grosser way than ever. The sketches are
numerous and the pace is such that no jokes
wear thin. Like the series, the content is a mix
of visual humour, mindless destruction and idi-
otically dangerous stunts. Particularly surreal
and entertaining scenes include a panda-medi-
ated vandalism spree launched in nocturnal
Tokyo and the world's bumpiest tattoo, carried
out in the back of a jeep being driven off-road
by Henry Rollins.
Bringing out the S&M voyeur buried deeply
(or not so deeply) in all of us, this film is addic-
tive and impossible to look away from.
Although you may spend the entire time curling
up your toes in horror and suppressing your gag
reflex, you might be surprised at how entertain-
ing the whole thing actually is. Believe me, I
wasn't exactly relishing an hour and a half
watching overgrown skaters shitting in panda
costumes and FlexiToning each other's per-
ineums (at least not on a week night) but still, I
have to admit, it was good.
This film is definitely one for the boys. That's
not to say, of course, that it can't also be
enjoyed by the fairer sex. Girls, if you can stom-
ach the copious amounts of blood, sick and shit
(not to mention the inherent homoeroticism),
then this film may be just the thing for you to
get in touch with your (testosterone-ridden-15-
year-old) masculine side. If you can't, then the
frequent shots of a half naked Johnny Knoxville
(plus other assorted male body parts) and a fan-
tastic soundtrack will go some way to make you
feel better about the cost of the cinema ticket.
If you're looking for an intellectual and cerebral
cinematic experience then Jackass The Movie is
not the one for you. But if you want to watch a
group of men old enough to know better doing
Heeere's Johnny...
what any teenage boy worth his skate shoes
dreams of, then see this film. Just a warning
though, if you are a collector of matchbox cars,
or hold a deep psychological dependency on
them, do not see this film. You'll never look at
skid marks in the same way again.

OUT NOW DN DVD
Ok, not that I've had this bloody movie on
order for six months or anything, but I was
ever-so excited when I wearily returned from
(yet) another day of demonstrating to find my
proverbial box bulging with a tantalising pack-
age. Finally. Finally I could watch the film
event of the year. The heir apparent to the bil-
lion dollar grossing movie throne. The most
special special effects ever. And Spider-man -
which was a plus I guess.
I missed this in the cinemas and haven't
really forgiven myself since. Sure, I was work-
ing 24/7 trying to write a PhD thesis, but I
ask you honestly - is even that worth missing
this movie during its time on the big screen?
Well, suffice to say the box office release of
Spidey passed me by so I was forced to await
the DVD, while determinedly fending off the
temptation of a "pirate" version which by this
time had achieved a circulation close to that
of the film itself. No camcorder-tastic experi-
ence for me - I needed to see this movie in its
pure, virginal state.
So. Yes. I realise it's an overly large pream-
ble (even for a pro rambler like myself) but I
felt it necessary to try and give you an insight
into just how much I was looking forward to
watching this movie.
Short and simple - its great fun, with a
heavy dose of spectacular thrown in. Sam
Raimi has really set the standard for the com-
ing glut of super-hero flicks (Daredevil, X2,
The Hulk) with this excellent adaptation of
the Spider-man story.
The clothes maketh the Spider-man
Remarkably (in this day and age at least)
character development is not only present and
correct, it is positively enthralling, to such an
extent that I found myself going back over the
interplay between Tobey Maguire's Peter
Parker and Kirsten Dunst's MJ more than I did
the action sequences. Which, as it happens,
are shockingly good. I do admit that there are
flaws in the CGI, but they are nowhere near
as apparent as those that have cropped up in
other recent blockbusters (Blade II for exam-
ple). The comic-book purists have had
"issues" with some features of the adaptation
(organic webslingers, the costume of Dafoe's
Green Goblin to name but two) but I really
don't think there's a great deal wrong with
this movie. Particular scenes that have
become fast favourites of mine are the excel-
lent back story and the final breathtaking shot
of Spidey making his way across New York as
only he can. If you haven't seen this, add it to
your Chrimbo list now - I can't see anyone
being disappointed with this DVD.
Which brings me nicely onto the extras.
Now, not having infinite time to digest these
nuggets of DVD goodness (owing to the arrival
of the extended LOTR DVD...) I will have to
skim over some bits. Two commentaries, the
usual director plus stars one (great but for
Kirsten Dunst) and one from CGI guru John
Dykstra. There's a few out-takes (no deleted
scenes), documentaries and screen tests but
the stand out piece is the documentary on
Spidey (the comic-book character), featuring
such luminaries as Stan Lee, Todd
MacFarlane, Kevin Smith (whose recently
trodden ground I happen to worship) ...the
list goes on. Anyone who knows more than a
touch about comics will recognise this as a
stellar cast, all assembled to pay tribute to
our costumed hero. Great stuff to watch.
So, all in all its a pretty damn fine DVD.
With LOTR and Episode II competing with it
for a place under the Christmas tree it has to
be. My only regret is that Stan Lee still hasn't
seen a penny from this movie - the genius
behind Spidey, The Hulk, The Fantastic Four
and many, many more instantly recognisable
comic-book heroes has been (allegedly)
stiffed by the film's financier. Which for me
sours the flavour of the best super-hero film
yet.
