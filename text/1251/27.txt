Virgins Exposed
- Tighthead Prop
Rachael 'Monkey' Platel
Chemistry 2
She has a total inability to stand
up for any reasonable length of
lime, but gives plenty of 'sin-
cere' advice. A more fearless
new Fresher we have never
seen.
In a word: Lovely
0^ Hooker
2 Charlotte 'Muttley' Miller
Biology 3
Her poor drinking ability really
needs lots of work. Has an out-
side interest from the LSE 1st
team captain. Gaffer.
In a word: Ginger
0^ Loosehead Prop
3 Fila 'Steely' Steel
Biology 1
Very placid off the pitch, but a
really feisty bugger on it. Went
over to the Darkside, with Lee
Barry.
In a word: Traitor
0^ Loosehead Prop
Tanya 'Stinky' Paulose
Medicine 1
She's silent but violent, and one
to be watched out for. Her
speedy downage has to be com-
mended, and is indeed a lesson
to us all. She's also a positive
steamroller on the pitch.
In a word: Enigmatic
jm Second Row
^[ Nicola 'Dappy' Williams
Maths 2
With a personal motto of "The
bigger tits the better" she can't
go far wrong. She's pulled too
many rugby men to count. Piglet
Spit. Hobby: baking.
In a word: Dappy
_ Second Row
5 M e
* 'Baggy' Webb
Zoology 1
On the pitch she can be spotted
from a distance by the pair of
seriously large shorts she tends
to sport. She's also a farmer
from Somerset. Rarely seen
without a pint of Snakebite in
hand.
In a word: Aloof
_ Second Row
5 A l e k s
'Pinky' Corn
Materials 2
Known as Pinky - as in not the
brain. She has an unusual habit
of fancying men with spotty
arses. Totally off her nut, but is
often to be found on a pair of
them. Not fussy who she has or
where she gets it.
In a word: Friendly
Blindside Flanker
ffo Jenny 'Porkwell' Anwell
Maths 1
Toploader. "Mohan Chahal first
team captain". She is, however,
not always in control of all, or
indeed any, of her bodily func-
tions.
In a word (well, two): Porks Well
_ Openside Flanker
Jg Dan 'Spatchcock' Gumm
Chemistry 2
Mark Cox. She is totally food
obsessed, and is an absolute
chunder monkey: if she's not pro-
ducing it, then she's probably
falling over in it.
In a word (well, two): mmm.. Cow.
_ Flanker
Jg Sian 'Amnesia' Whiting
Computing 3
She's made us a blinding new
website. Newport supporter, so
Dan approves. An all round gen-
eral good egg, all things consid-
ered.
In a word: fly-by-night
0^ Number Eight
Gemma 'Lumpy' Swain
BioChem PG
She's recently pulled two best
mate adolescents, and is the
future wife to Freddy Ljungberg.
Feisty.
In a word: Callipo
0^ Number Eight
Q| Kitty 'Fe
"'x
' FitzGerald
Medicine 1
Diabolical downage: she must
learn. Has single handedly raised
the average height of the team by
six inches. Too many half pints,
methinks. Right dirty madam in
the bedroom.
In a word: Pussy

Scrum Half
Hui Ling 'Minor' Kerr
Medicine 6
Her departure will be a horren-
dous loss to the team. Vicious
little bugger on the pitch. She's
fearless, and has a truly com-
mendable ability to read the
game, and there was epic chun-
derage on her final match night.
Quality gumshield. Will make a
blinding doctor.
In a word: Psycho
0^ Scrum Half
Aoife 'Scruffy' Doran
Chem Eng2
A real asset to the side and
moves like a streak of lighting
on the pitch, and is known for
her quality comedy hat. She's a
demon whatever position she's
played in.
In a word: Slinky
\ %J Helen 'Snotty-Posh' Parry
Chemistry PG
Soon to be Dr McAllister. Has
some lush kinky boots, and real-
ly loves her latex. Please note
the exceptionally large rock on
her left fore-finger, which she is
still willing to show to anyone
who asks. She can often be
found in the middle of a maul
after another blinding run.
In a word: Geriatric
,0 ,g Winger
J J Jess 'Jeff Brice
Mech Eng 1
Little Jess has followed in the
Virgin tradition of bright red
hair. She's going out with an old
fart who's even older than
Snotty-Posh and is built like a
tank.
In a word: Spiky
0. 0^ Inside Centre
J Kate 'Welshie' Bayliss
Chemistry 4
A mouthy, lippy and scary welsh
woman. Her hair changes mar-
ginally more often than her
pants do, and she's a fine
ambassador for Guinness. She's
also written huge numbers of
lush Virgin reports.
In a word: Lush

J ^[ Sara 'Poca' Seegobin
Geology 2
A little absent of late, being the
workaholic that she is. Reliable
steamroller on the pitch, and is
the source of an endless stream
of kwality jokes. Featured in an
incident involving peeing on
Bolson. She also has issues
poohing in college.
In a word: Biff
— 0M Outside Centre
jk Jess 'Pete' Brewer
Mech Eng 3
She's a shy dawg, and her alco-
hol consumption seems to rise
as fast as her nicotine levels
and rugby boy tally with each
passing Wednesday night. Very
tolerant: if she doesn't like you,
no one will.
In a word: Growl
4 JU W
'"ser
J Alex 'Bendy' Trevenen
Chemistry 2
She has the talent of actually
being able to put her foot in her
own mouth. Made her debut at
the Christmas dinner with some
hardcore scrabble playing on the
dance floor. A little edgy when
she's trying to quit smoking.
In a word: Trev

Full Back
Ash 'Filthy' Camina
Geology 2
Her bar name really says it all.
She's the life and soul of RSM,
and is always swift with the witty
put downs. Seen donning a sexy
swimming cap every game to pro-
tect the sacred weave. Always on
the lookout for some steaming
man chicken. Miss Nigeria.
In a word: Respect
. Full Back
I ^% Priya 'Cocky' Sokhal
Medicine 1
Full of energy and enthusiasm
and is always bouncy at the back.
She can be a little too sure of her-
self at times though. Purple chun-
der. She's a bit keen on kicking,
on occasion. Insanely annoying
use of text format in e-mails
