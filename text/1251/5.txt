UBS is a leading global financial services firm serving a diverse
client base ranging from affluent individuals to multinational
institutions and corporations. We are an integrated group
encompassing investment banking and securities, private
banking, asset management and retail and corporate banking.
It's true that building a career in financial services demands a strong
sense of self and determination. And that's what you'll need to take
advantage of the wealth of opportunities and diversity of roles available.
We offer a 10-week structured summer internship programme for
penultimate year students which is a vital tool in our graduate
recruitment process. Throughout the summer, there will be events
which will ensure your experience is packed with learning, training
and networking opportunities.
The closing date for summer internship applications is 14 February
2003. All applications must be made online - please visit our website
