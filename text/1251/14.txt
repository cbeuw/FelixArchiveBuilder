ShyFX and T-Power
Set It Off
Albums & Single
4 / 5
Known for bringing Drum and
Bass to the mainstream last year,
ShyFX and T-Power return with
another slice of urban life. And
believe me, after listening to
them, you have the most affable
dance album since the Artful
Dodger's 'It's All About the
Stragglers'.
Setting it off with Intro, is the
surprise inclusion of chart RnB
style MC versus girlie vocals from
Fallacy, which sticks out like a
sore thumb in an array of party-
friendly urban tracks. The first
highlight, is track two, the famous
'Shake Your Body'. It's infectious,
it's catchy, and irresistible to
dance to, 'those garage tunes are
so fine, they just blow my mind'.
This is what Lonyo should've
made!
Spanish guitars and salsa beats
bring in the infamous Kele Le
Roc, of lisp, limp ballads and
madonna piercing fame. Her
trademark breathy vocals, show-
cased back in 98, and on
Damage's 'Maria' are conspicu-
ously absent in this irresistible
track,'Feelin' You' displaying her
true vocal talents. A jazz band
over shifting drums being in the
most 'garage' track on the album,
'Calling'. And this is about as
underground as it gets, garage to
chill out to. There's more of where
that came from on 'Don't Wanna
Give a Damn', another laid-back,
funky tune.
'Shake UR Body' Part II arrives
on 'Don'f Wanna Know', a good
enough effort, but overly reminis-
cent of track two. Luckily, 'I've Got
an Idea' with it's sexy vocals
arrives, and leaves, to distract me
from this. I even find myself
singing along, and it ends, cruelly,
I think, just as it gets going. Ragga
comes on the scene, in the form of
Elephant Man, and successfully
juxtaposes itself next to the sexy
sounds of Damage's resident
smoothie, Coree Richards (barf!
:P). Thankfully, Coree's vocals are
as hardcore as his endless, rip-
pling torso. He gives us a clear
indication of where Sean Escoffery
should be, where Lifford David left
off, and where Lynden David Hall
wants to be.
The album falls flat from this
point on. Only the interlude from
Fabio, with his passable yet amus-
ing Del Trotter impression and the
last track, 'Everything' a chilled-
out masterpiece that every self-
respecting MOS album should
have, saves the day, but only just.
Only just. By the skin of it's teeth,
this album just about makes it
into my top ten of the year.

Blondie
Greatest Hits
4 / 5
So it's Christmas time - let's cash
in. This is probably why this new
compilation, which follows in an
extremely long line of Blondie hits
and remix albums. I start to won-
der if the band is benefiting or
hurting from this constant stream
of such albums. But okay, why am
I here? To review the album itself.
Packaged rather nicely, with
pictures of the band at their
prime, it contains some well
researched liner notes by Steve
Pafford. The selection itself?
Actually pretty well paced, I nice
mix of albums tracks and hit sin-
gles, with all the famous songs
represented - 'Atomic', 'Heart Of
Glass', 'Rapture', 'Call Me', 'One
Way or Another' and 'The Tide is
High'. Having not having listened
properly to Blondie before, and
having heard cover versions of
'Call Me' and 'The Tide is High', I
have to admit the covers outdo
the originals, partly because they
seem to have more energy (espe-
cially in Nikka Costa's version of
'Call Me') in comparison to Debbie
Harry's cooly reserved vocals. The
actual song the Kittens almost
murdered is markedly superior to
the cover, giving the reggae beat
and trumpet playing first prefer-
ence over Harry's vocals.
The rest of the album, is
straight-forward, good-time guitar-
pop. Songs like 'One Way Or
Another' and 'Maria' show
Harry's versatility as a vocalist,
working effectively against the
almost dance-able background.
She does menacing, dangerous,
tough, tender and plaintive equal-
ly well, as we see on 'Heart of
Glass' and 'Denis'. The songs are
enjoyable, twenty-five years later,
but as there's been a lot of newer,
heavier guitar and dance music,
they don't stand up in my opinion
as well as they should do accord-
ing to how Blondie are perceived
as legends in the eyes of older lis-
teners. However, they keep selling
well these days, and that's one of
the testaments of Blondie's music,
its endurance. Sajini
Singles
Avril Lavigne - Skater Boi
Excellent stuff this. Real
genius, real audio brilliance:
"He was a Skater boy, said see
you later boy"
One of the diamond pivots in
the cocktail of everything
unmusical and wrong. I con-
cede that the talent that is Avril
Lavigne is of very specific taste
and that as such it should not
be reviewed next to anything
passable as music. However
since Felix has not been allocat-
ed space for a "Rare Arts" page,
this is where you are con-
demned to read about them.
The one thing I can say about
'Skater Boi' is that it is upbeat.
- I guess to some people this
maybe uplifting or anthemic.
Probably not though, I really
couldn't see that being the case
- instead I think the phrase
uncomplicated "chick rock" will
have to suffice. Imagine a run of
the mill Blink 182 song, but
with a girl singing and less
thought put in.

Wyclef Jean feat. Tom Jones -
Pussycat
Taken from the current album
Masquerade, Wyclef has this
time teamed up with the ol'
underwear king himself to pro-
duce a dismal hip hop remix of
What's new Pussycat? In, his
attempt to be eclectic, or
ecleftic (his previous album
title), this ex-fugee seems to
have forgotten that he also
needs to produce a decent
record. In desperate attempts
to fill the colossal void between
each chorus (the Tom Jones
sample), 'clef raps about 'ghet-
to cats, alley cats, freaky cats,
kit kats' whilst stressing the
importance of 'paying child
support to your kittens'.
