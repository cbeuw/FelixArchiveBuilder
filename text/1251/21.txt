Synopsis: Something to make you feel warm and fuzzy on those lonely
Xmas nights searching for faster, filthier, Eastern European, facial cum
shot sites.
Rating: Not the most informative, or technologically demanding site for
all you dandruff collectors out there, but anyone with fond memories of
Mr will be sure to enjoy his adventures. Basically, I pity the fool who
doesn't enjoy this site! (Cheap, yes, but we couldn't resist)
Coffeebreak Score: 7.5/10

my eye."

I feel."
