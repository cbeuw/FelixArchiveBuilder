Page Six F E L I X 22nd October, 1979
In the last year, those of you who were around, will
probably have come across the work of the Student Tele-
vision of Imperial College in the shape of the Newsreel or
Mike Raven talking about his experiences in Pirate Radio.
STOIC's object is to give its members experience in oper-
ating T V equipment and to make T V programmes to show
to the members of the Union. We operate from the T V
studio in Elec Eng (who have been a great help to us) and
so far have shown our programmes by man-handling the
Video Tape Recorder down to the ICR.
Our activities at present are being hindered by several
unavoidable difficulties:
Firstly, the department is rebuilding the studio (and, we
hope, improving it) and it will be out of action for the rest
of this term at least.
Our output, when it gets going again, cannot now be
shown in the old way as the V T R will not travel well and
we don't want to damage it. The answer is to install a line
between Room 306 in Elec Eng and the I C R , a distance of
less than 50 yards. The cost of the line and installation was
worked out to be around £50. However, when the money
was asked for R C C rightly passed it on to Student Finance.
Eventually it worked its way back to us and College main-
tenance had estimated £600 for the cost! Their idea of in-
stallation was to permanently pass the cable through duct-
ing via the basements of Elec Eng and College Block. With
the extra equipment this would entail the extra cost was
enormous. Since our line would only be used for Union
purposes (unless the College wished to rent time on the
circuit) the lines to the SCR and other rooms incorporated
in the maintenance plan, would not be necessary.
Normal finance is another problem. T V is an incredibly
expensive medium, with the Department wanting £2/10/0 an
hour for use of the Studio. The production of even the smal-
lest programme then becomes costly and R C C can hardly
be expected to spend all their time discussing our finance.
It would rather be like Felix having to account for every
article separately to an overworked committee.
With the link coming in to bring programmes from the
Inner London Education Authority and the facilities offered
by the National Association of Student Television it should
be possible for STOIC eventually to show programmes of a
highly diverse nature on several days a week as well as pro-
viding an outlet for the cine photographers in the college
who fancy covering news.
A note about membership. We have sadly to charge you
10 shillings for the privilege of slogging your guts out to
make programmes (it is very hard work) but if you still
fancy helping us and the College then get in touch with
R I C H A R D P A R K I N S Maths III who will send you a form
asking you your particular interests which may range from
Newsreading to Producing. Or if you are around E E 306 then
drop in and ask our friendly neighbourhood Technician
Colin for a form.

Racer reviewed
I suppose that the case of
D O W N H I L L R A C E R is
not far removed from that
of C H A R L I E B U B B L E S .
When Albert Finney made
C H A R L I E B U B B L E S about
three years ago, one would
have thought the commercial
release would be quite
assured. Directed by a well
known actor, also taking the
main role, with Billie White-
law, Colin Blakely and Liza
Minelli, and screenplay by
Shelagh Delany, it would
have been expected to do
well. Indeed, when first re-
leased in America only, it
was well received by the
critics and the cinema-geing
public. However the big
British Circuits wouldn't
bite, so that when it opened
at the Chelsea Essoldo, after
a big critical build-up, not
surprisingly it broke the box-
office records.
D O W N H I L L R A C E R ,
now on an indefinite run at
the Chelsea Essoldo, is ap-
parently doing even better,
after they cornered its Lon-
don p r e m i e r following
"selected release" in the pro-
vinces and a similar critical
reaction.
Robert Redford's role is a
complete change from the
self-assured Sundance. In
D O W N H I L L R A C E R he
plays David Chappallet, a
skier in the United States'
team competing in Europe.
As a downhill racer his
single-mindedness and selfish
drive bring him into conflict
with the team's coach. But
his first international season
is a success until he falls in
the last race. Back home in
Colorado he is aimless, at a
loss trying to communicate
with his father. Back in
Europe for the Winter
Olympics a rash contest be-
tween him and a team-mate
leads to an accident and
David's becoming the team's
main hope. He of course
wins the Gold Medal after a
spectacular performance.
The film nicely captures
the transient atmosphere,
and the hard ambition in the
event without the too com-
mon novelettish injections of
"humanising" drama — the
sportsmen here are far re-
moved from the Bond image.
With Ichikawa's Tokyo
Olympics film, this must
rank as one of the best films
about sport. The photo-
graphy of the race scenes is
superb — very exciting and
looking absolutely authentic.
Its success is that its enjoy-
ment doesn't depend on be-
ing a sportman, let alone a
skier, oneself. Apart from an
occasional lapse into irritat-
ing stylisation — the frozen
images in the credits —
Michael Ritchie has directed
an excellent film.
