RFC win first game
Soccer:
I.C. lst X V 26pts.
Brunei University 8 pts.
With most of last season's
Cupwinners back in the side,
I.C. fielded a useful team at
Uxbridge last Wednesday
14th. Full back Pudney (a
7th year Civ Eng student and
Norfolk full back) opened
the scoring by kicking two
good penalties. Brunei coun-
tered by scoring a scrappy
try which the I.C. defence
must take the blame for, but
soon after Roy Anderson
went over in the corner for
his usual try.
9 pts—5 pts. was the score
at half time with I.C.
obviously well on top, win-
ning set scrummages and
lines-out quite tidily, but be-
ing very scrappy in the loose
rucks. Pre-season lack of fit-
ness prevented great deeds in
the second half with the pack
lagging towards the end.
However a good try was
scored by Alan Roberts
from a move started by
skipper Kip Conolly —
these two combining well
throughout the game. The
rest of the I.C. points came
from the boot of Pudney
whose kicking was super-
lative, 9 out of 9 kicks going
over.
A good start, but fitness
is essential to gain good ball
for the I.C. backs who look
like being very useful this
season. Also good perfor-
mances from the two freshers
in the side, Roy Morns and
Jon Hunt.
Team: R. Pudney, R.
Anderson, W. Baines, D.
Conolly (capt.), K . Devany,
A . Roberts, J. Abbott, D.
Amos, P. Earl, G. Widelski,
R. Morris, S. Owens, J.
Hunt, N . Icely, M . Adams.

CROSS
COUNTRY
Although we have lost a
very large percentage of our
old members, the fresher in-
take appears to be high, and
includes several very pro-
mising runners. The main
question still to be answered
is whether the second team
will be strong enough to
stay in the First Division of
the London Colleges Cross
Country League, a task
which may be accomplished
by good attendance rather
than by good running.
Apart from the League,
other interesting matches
held this term will include
the Priory Relays at Reigate,
the Osterley Park Relay and
the London University
Championships. There will
also be the usual multi-
cornered / inter-college fix-
tures and attractive away
trips to Norwich and Bris-
tol.
The success and liveliness
of the club could be im-
proved by new members.
Standards in the club, and
indeed throughout London
colleges, vary from inter-
national to pub crawlers!
Quotation from the secre-
tary: "Had a good one todav
— came 837th" (1970
Nationals).
Two of last year's mem-
bers, Norman Morrison and
Barry Jones, represented
Scotland and New Zealand
respectively in the Edinburgh
Commonwealth G a m e s .
Norman was eliminated in
the heats of the 1500 metres
event, while Barry was mid-
way back in the marathon.
Meanwhile Bob Jensen has
gone out to Nigeria for a
couple of years (out of the
way) and Eth Himsworth is
somewhere in the North Sea.
Rod Brook and Tony Car-
ter were last heard of in
Canada.
HOCKEY
I.C. Hockey
The first trial was held on
Wednesday, 7th October at
Harlington and attended by
some twenty-five freshers.
Although the conditions
were far from ideal- many of
them showed a great deal
of promise and enthusiasm
for the coming season.
However, we are certainly
in need of more players, so
I shall be grateful if any
fresher, whether or not he
visited us on freshers' day,
who is still interested in
playing would contact a
member of the committee as
soon as possible.

There are no less than 23
sporting clubs operating
under the auspices of A.C.C.
These vary from the tradi-
tional ones such as rugby,
soccer and hockey, to rather
more sophisticated ones such
as tenpin bowling, ski-ing,
lacrosse and judo.
I.C. sport has much to live
up to this year after last ses-
sion's sweeping victories. The
A.F.C. lst X I won the Uni-
versity League Cup, their
2nd X I won both their cup
and League competitions
and even the 6th X I won
their Cup competition. The
soccer club also had a suc-
cessful tour of Germanv.
The R F C X V won trie
Gutteridge Cup (the U . L .
Competition) and enjoyed a
successful tour of Belgium.
The Hockey club didn't win
any silverware last year, but
had a good session culminat-
ing in a tour of Holland.
The Boat Club had their
usual successful year, months
of hard training culminating
in various successes at Hen-
ley. The cricket club won the
University cup yet again and
savoured some strange beers
on their club tour of Devon
and Cornwall. The cross-
country club produced some
extremely fine athletes last
thrashed
I.C. lst XI 9, QEC 1
In this pre-league friendly
against Q E C last Wednesday
14th, I.C. put in no less than
nine goals! Fielding a very
s t r o n g side, containing
Bakerwell as the only
Fresher in goal, they proved
too strong for our Camden
Hill neighbours.
The side as a whole played
well but the game was
marred by a knee injury to
defender Paul Worthington
who was replaced by Masiin.
Mention must be made of
striker Tony Holland who
bagged 5 goals no less. The
other scorers were Willcock
(1), Willey (1), Kelly (1) and
even Darley appeared from
nowhere to head in a very
good goal!
A good start — bodes well
for the U.L. league yet again.
Team: Bakewell, Worth-
ington, Fryer, Willcock, J.
Darley, Barnard, Willey,
Holland, McArdle, Dixon

year who gained top class
honours, reflecting the cur-
rent strength of the club.
ICWSC in all departments
were very strong considering
their relative lack of mem-
bers, perhaps the hockey
club being most successful.
Lawn tennis for once
didn't win the U L cup, but
did everything else. The
swimming club had a fine
season, possessing a very
strong and experienced water
polo team. The standard of
squash at I.C. reached its
highest level yet last year,
and this must be the college's
fastest growing sport.
Other clubs, such as golf,
fencing, sailing, volleyball,
table tennis and ten pin
bowling all had good fixture
lists and are all strong in
standard and depth. We wish
luck to the two new clubs
in A.C.C. viz. lacrosse and
ski-ing.
Just watch the club notice
boards in the U N I O N for
information regarding teams,
social events etc., and make
your club the club this year.
7, Weeks.
The team made a good
start to the season by win-
ning all the preliminary
rounds and beating U.C. in
the final.
This was followed by a
fine win against Sussex Uni-
versity on Wednesday, 14th
Oct. Although Sussex started
well, a strong I.C. attack
found gaps in their defence
and accurate shooting by
Lynne Beynon gave the team
a 4—0 lead at half-time.
During the second half
general unfitness caused the
team to flag but a goal by
Brenda Dilley brought the
final score to 5-0.

son; L . Beynon; H . Rowson;

Volleyball
This year the Volleyball
Club has entered teams in
two leagues. The stiffest test
will come in the National
League Division 2 (Southern
Area) to which we gained
promotion last year.
The second team will be
playing in the S E E T E C H
Volleyball League on Wed-
nesday afternoons, and stand
a better chance of success
than the first team!
In the coming year we
hope to build a team
worthy of our national
status, so we can attract an
increased membership in
future years.
EDITORIAL
BY T H E time you peruse this rather hurried piece of
journalism (?) those of you new to college will have realised
what a strong bastion of sport IC is! The huge and ponderous
machinery of ACC has clicked smoothly into gear and most
clubs have either played their first few matches or are well
into their training programmes.
As may be gathered from the article elsewhere on this
page on the past record of the clubs, a great tradition of
sporting successes is to be found here. Hence our magnificent
facilities, there is the sports centre at Harlington and the
boathouse at Putney. However what is important is the sport-
ing circles of IC in that these facilities are available to any-
one and everyone, whatever standard one's sporting activities
are. The social activities of most of the ACC clubs are wide
and diverse, catering to the most perverted tastes! This is
what university sport — and perhaps university life is all
about. A sense of involvement and participation is a must if
the average student wants to lead a full life.
So everyone, especially the freshers, don't be put off by
the shouts of sportsmen being called reactionaries, Union bar
clique and all other puerile tabs bandied about, sport is for
all, male and female, black and white, hairies and non-
hairies.
Sport is the greatest social leveller available and what-
ever politicians say, an utter destroyer and enemy of pre-
judice. So enjoy it to the full while you have both the
faculties and the facilities.

Athletic Club
IC athletic club has made a good start to the year by
recruiting a good crop of freshers, several of whom must
be destined for greater things.
As well as providing a stepping stone to inter-university
competition with U L U , the club itself has a succession of
fixtures which this year should be well attended. Obviously
most meetings take place in the Summer term, but the sea-
son ends well before exam time.
