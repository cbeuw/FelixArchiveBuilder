This year's disruption in
your routine of carefully
ordered sloths—the two-hour
lunehbreak—is, you ruefully
note .getting daily more diffi-
cult not to fill. Tuesdays and
Thursdays you can cope with
like last year by not going
to General Studies, or, if
that's not boring enough, you
can intensify your inactivity
to include not going to Union
Meetings as well. But what
about the rest of the week.
You may even have consider-
ed occasionally doing some-
thing for fear of spoiling your
apathy paletter by over-ex-
posure—if so, a suggestion:
A m b i a n c e Lunch-Time
Theatre Club's two one-act
plays (Tt Bees Dat Way' and
'Arrest") daily 1.15—2.0 at
I.C.A., Nash House, The
Mall.
In the first play, the small
white audience is incited to
violence and/or reduced by
the smaller but sexier black
oast. The latter (having the
advantage of knowing wheth-
er there is a script, and who
is actor and who merely got
free tickets on the pretext of
reviewing the thing) manage
to reduce the former to an
embarrassed crocodile shuf-
fling uncertainly towards the
exit.
End of play one.
Now a policeman appears,
enlists everyone as special
constables, complete with
uniforms, and, ignoring prods
and ^Say are you real's' from
the bolder elements, sends
them back to the auditorium
to 'raid' the Obscene play
taking place there . . . gradu-
ally the audience realized that
it is now in the second play
but is more concerned with
ithe injustices it finds itself
committing in the name of
'censorship'. . .
and flops
Emerson Lake & Palmer,
supposed to be playing at
Brunei last Saturday, took
one look at the surroundings
and decided to go home to
Mother—which was why a
lot of people turned up at
I.C. Hop. The S.U. card
checkers in the Union Arch
valiantly fought off this in-
surge of undesirable aliens
by installing a moat of beer
between the snack-bar and
the Union office, and slinking
off to watch the security
guards' television. The ineffi-
ciency of these methods was
fortunately matched only by
their short-sightedness in fail-
ing to notice that most of the
alliens were not undesirable,
but F E M A L E .
Food
Venturing into Ithe Union
clutching a future programme
for Ents, there was an imme-
diate confrontation with
Dramsoc attempting to sell
tickets and Ents trying to
conduct a Spanish inquisition
using an imported foreign
correspondent who wished
to know where you had come
from, and other personal
questions. A t the same time
Henry added to the confusion
by showing a thing film and
having a sale of what they
helpfully claimed to be
F-O-O-D. The significance of
the latter was realised on
entering the Concert Hall, for
the bevy of birds seen arriv-
ing appeared both to have
changed sex and reverted to
1-964 (see photo). Rapidly
becoming disheartened an
expedition was organised to
a non-existent party.
President's piece
The president's life is a
constant round of commit-
tees—or so it sometimes
seems, moan. Participation
has come to mean bureau-
cracy, as the administration
instead of merely implemen-
ting policy decided by the
community, plays power poli-
tics. Instead of a community
there are various groups most
with their own unions. Part
of the function of a students
union is as a trade union.
Representative participation
does not just mean me or
any other bureaucrat trotting
along to a select number of
meetings—it means you, ready
to take the initiative for a
change. Departments will not
democratise unless staff and
students together act for their
own benefit, it is no good ex-
pecting the department or
year reps to suddenly change
department s t t r u c t u r e—
change only comes about by
direct involvement of a large
number of people. Depart-
ments do not change by col-
lege edict.
There are many non aca-
demic staff appointments
(e.g. Hall Wardens, Senior
Warden, Domestic Bursar) in
which we have no say. True
we were represented on the

selection oommittees for the
Associated Studies Aide and,
now, the Student Advisor, but
these are posts more or less
initiated by the Union and
in at least one case there was
strong opposition to our in-
clusion. There are simply no
student reps on such impor-
tant bodies as the Growth
Points Committee. The dan-
ger is of course being sucked
into committees to the extent
that the union officers are
seen to be involved in bad
decisions, a devious tactic.
Committees advise (e.g. see
the Refectory Committee and
what can happen with advis-
ory bodies), and their exis-
tence is in some cases a sham.
There is a smoke screen of
apparent student participa-
tion, whilst in fact the deci-
sions are reached after mock
consultation. Be aware!
With the college hours in-
creased to allow for more
flexibility in timetabling and
thus partly facilitate the in-
itnroduction of associated
studies, we have the oppor-
tunity to broaden courses.
Not just tacked on "liberal
studies", but by easing out
the unnecessary 'technical de-
tail in our courses, to inte-
grate non-technical studies as
credit carrying options.
There are too many ig-
norant experts. 'Science is
action and therefore unable
to sidestep its social and
political role. Associated
studies should not be yet
another lecture course but a
vital part of a diversfied de-
gree. Projects, such as Electri-
cal Engineering has develop-
ed, are one way of introduc-
ing the community to science.
Specialisation leads to com-
munication breakdown.
We live in isolation, blind to
other students, yet I.C. is part
of the national student move-
ment. The recent abuse of
conspiracy charges by the
law (e.g. Liverpool, Cam-
bridge, London Senate
House) places our freedom
more into jeopardy than does
any demo. Our only strength
is our solidarity.
Barclay's Bank has become
a symbol, an expression of
Britain's economic interests
in furthering white suprem-
acy in southern Africa. The
boycott expresses opposition
to the Cobora Bassa dam
scheme. There are other ways
to oppose South African
apartheid, but more insid-
ious is the racialism expres-
sed here. Relate to the com-
munity—look at Notting Hill
—problems, slums, but at
least capable of developing
a community spirit (unlike
sterile South Ken.) and as
students, later as scientists,
we should contribute.
More patriotism in the next
issue. Meanwhile I.C.U. News
will keep you informed and
union meetings keep us
active.
Balls
Apart from a couple of
balls-up with putting the
lights on at the wrong time,
Film Society members and
guests were relieved to find
an improved standard of pro-
jection and sound last Fri-
day. Chris Hanna, the So-
ciety's projectionist, had dis-
covered a poor contact in the
pre-amp of one projector,
which precluded a report of
the previous week's sizzling
sound. Further improvements
may be expected next week
with the purchase of a new
projector. The Society will
then have two reasonably
quiet-running machines.

Over the vacation, yet an-
other attempt has been made
to snatch away from the
Union the old Snack Bar
under the Union Arch. The
latest interested party to try
to get the plans altered com-
prises the Botany and Zoo-
logy Departments.
Last year it was eventually
agreed that Beit Hall would
have half the old Bookshop,
and the Union would have
all the Snack Bar, to be con-
verted next summer into an
Arts Lab cum lounge cum
club room cum storage room
cum whatever. A large num-
ber of clubs had expressed
interest in the scheme.
However, after the latest
interference with the plans,
there is a risk of 2/3 of the
Snack Bar going to Beit
Hall, Botany and Zoology,
as a lounge, while I.C.U.
would be left with the re-
maining 1/3 Snack Bar plus
the old Bookshop, i.e. two
small rooms instead of one
big (and more useful) one!
This last-minute mucking
about with the plans is
bound to raise strong pro-

Guilds Union now has pre-
cisely and exactly zero mem-
ber on its Executive. Roger
Wiltshire, the only one to
escape unscathed by exam-
iners, has now resigned to
stand as President. Steve
Bates, who was elected Presi-
dent last year but failed Elec
Eng 2 again, has been offici-
ally told that he cannot reg-
ister as a student for the
coming session.
The hustings for these
posts took place on Tuesday,
see F E L I C I T Y , and the Elec-
tions will be next Tuesday.
Likely candidates so far, with
no opposition when F E L I X
went to press, are Roger
Wiltshire for President,
Maria Wallis for Secretary,
Hugh Hutton for Junior
Treasurer, and Bernie Mack
for Vice-President.
