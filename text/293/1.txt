IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 22nd OCTOBER, 1970 No. 293
Union . . .
. . . meets
By normal standards, the first union meeting proper of
the new year was a quiet and orderly affair. It began with a
statement by Geoff Needham, explaining the situation of
car parking in the college, which was answered by M r .
Stephenson. The former suggested that students unable to ob-
tain car parking space inside the college, would be subsidised
by those who did, in order to pay for facilities outside the
college. This idea was rejected by M r . Stephenson, who said
that the cost of more security guards, needed to look after
the cars, would not be met by this subsidy and the whole
scheme was financially not feasible. This prompted a further
suggestion from Geoff Needham, that the union should sanc-
tion the appropriate authorities of the (borough to aid stud-
ents, who would be financially handicapped by the introduc-
tion of meters outside student houses, which had been
planned:
Next was the more serious business of lodgings and the
crisis at the lodgings bureau. W.L.S.A.B., which had been
dropped owing to the lack of finance, had been re-opened
by Subk Chatterjee and Janet. Following an advert in the
'^Evening Standard", a list of addresses had been compiled,
but this is manifestly not enough. What is needed are more
volunteers to help run the lodgings bureau. College authori-
ties have agreed to match, pound for pound, our £50 to help
provide more lodgings for I.C. students. Further money is
to be requested from the college, and it is also planned to
invite other U.S.K. colleges to contribute towards rebuilding
W.L.S.A.B. as it was intended — an area lodgings bureau.
The next topic on the agenda was that of refectories. Tony
Kirkham in making a statement about 'this, said that the
position was uncertain. The ensuing discussion was, to put
it mildly, clouded with uncertainty. However, the general
line was as follows.
L e t t e r
Judith Walker was supposed to have received a letter
(which she didn't), from the rector irfforming her of the
Emergency catering sub-committee's decision to convert the
Ante-Room into a waitress service refectory. However, it
had also been planned to turn the Ante-Room into an Art
gallery, and the college had received a grant amounting to
£300 towards this. She said that we should demand an end
to the former on 26th October, when a new waitress service
refectory is due to open, and that we should submit a long
term plan, which would, amongst other things, help stop
the profit-loss cycle which has dogged the refectories since
their opening about twenty years ago. (They lost around
£28,000 this year!) to the special refectory committee due
to meet shortly, with the rector in the chair.
Mr. Stephenson said that the Ante-Room had been turned
into a waitress service refectory at the request of the Students
refectory committee; this was hotly denied by Judith Walker.
This had been done because, with the closure of the Union
waitress service refectory, students had complained that they
had no place to entertain their friends visiting the college.
Gradually certain questions came to light. (1) Why was the
decision to move the waitress service to the Ante-Room an
emergency decision? (2) Why was the Ante-Room which is
one of the few communal rooms in the college block, chosen?
(3) Why is there such a lack of flow of information between
the staff and the student refectories committees? Surely,
with a better exchange of information, problems like this
would be avoided.
OTC
Next business was the "O.T.C. and U.L.U. air squadron
freshers stall affair". Judith Walker had refused to allow
New heads at IC
The first week of 'this year's
Freshers' Dinners in the Un-
ion has provided the usual
varied collection of irrespons-
ible acts; from the wildness of
Chem Eng to the drunkenness
of Mines.
The Aero dinner of Mon-
day 12th went without inci-
dent until 23.00 when R.C.S.
supporters decided to clear
the bar by use of the fire
hose. Although this did in-
deed empty the bar, the
soaked occupants were not
so amused.
Piano Smashing
Thursday 15th was the day
of the Chem Eng dinner,
which has aquired a bad
reputation over the past few
years. Although C.&G.U. of-
ficials tried to maintain order
some students decided to
bounce down the stairs to
the bar the new secondhand
piano from the 'Senior Com-
mon Room. Through jump-
ing up and down on the
piano, they cracked the key-
board cover. More Guilds-
men had to have a go at the
Lower Lounge piano — this
was locked, but while playing
about they managed to break
off a hammer! Overall, de-
spite the large number of
broken glasses, the dinner
was calmer than in previous
years.
The following night the
Mining Dinner happened.
Despite their reputation as
beer drinkers, many present
could not hold down their
liquor. The Union bar toilet,
in particular, was left in a
disgusting state — barman
Brendon Clements has never
seen it in such a mess. Also,
when one of the cleaners went
into the Dining Hall next
morning, she was made ill by
the smell!
Selkirk Bingo
Afterwards, Minesmen
caused some nuisance in the
vicinity of Southside, and
Mr. Seafood was seen in
Princes Gardens playing Sel-
kirk Bingo (what, again???)
after five empty Party Four
cans were thrown out of 462
Selkirk. There are rumoured
to 'have been 22 people in that
room when the aforemention-
ed and be-dressing-gowned
Mr. Seafood tried to calm
the Minesmen down.
The Governing Body of the
Imperial College of Science
and Technology has elected
five new Fellows of the Im-
perial College who will re-
ceive their scrolls of Fellow-
ship at the annual Com-
memoration Day Ceremony
in the Royal Albert Hall on
Thursday, 22nd October,
1970.

Remember how those her-
oic Constituent Colleges stoic-
ally took a 10 per cent cut
in their grant estimates at
Joint Council last session?
Now, with a changed com-
position of Council, R.C.S.U.
and R.S.M.U. decided to sub-
mit "revised estimates". No
guesses which way their esti-
mates would be revised—de-
spite the fact that fantasti-
cally increased I.C. Bookshop
profits mean that Constituent
Colleges have more money
this year than ever before.
At the time of going to
press, a lively debate on the
subject was expected at last
Monday's I.C.U. Council
meeting—further report in
F E L I C I T Y .
As Mooney's prices make
their annual increase, F E L I X
is pleased to announce the
results of an expedition to
Greasy Pete's. Not only is
the price still the same, but
also the quality and quantity
are up on their usual stand-
ard. The Parkview Cafe, its
proper name, is situated on
the corner of Fulham Road
and Fulham Palace Road

the Department of Geology
from 1920 to 1924.

Moving the Freshers' Fair
over to College Block this
year certainly seems to have
been a good idea, despite the
difficulties of organisation, as
far as most club's member-
ship figures are concerned. In
fact certain clubs have now
an embarrassing number of
devotees.
Probably the most embar-
rased are Film Soc, who use
Mech. Eng. 220 for their
shows—seating capacity 340
but the Society has 690 mem-
bers! This could cause con-
siderable nuisance if all of
the members decided to go to
the same film. In future, no
guest tickets will be on sale
at the door, though this
strikes F E L I X as rather put-
ting the cart before the horse,
or playing the Queen before
opening the doors.

One club, however, that is
not embarrassed through ex-
cessive membership is F E L -
(Continued on Page 8)
them to set up a stall at Freshers fair. Her reasons for doing
this were a mixture of good and bad. Firstly, she said that
there would not have been space for them, which is fair
enough, and secondly that they were a "paramilitary organ-
isation". So what? Surely it is the Union's decision, not hers?
The Union were in sound disagreement with the president,
and a motion was passed to invite them to set up a stall
next year.
The time was nearing 2:30, when Piers Corbyn read a
lengthy motion about college hours, which have been in
creased, which few people, if any, understood. However, it
signalled an end to the meeting as everyone drifted out
back to classes.
