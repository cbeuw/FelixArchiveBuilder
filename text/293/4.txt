Local pubs reviewed
The story so far —
After weeks of heartbreak-
ing research examining ash-
trays and beery carpets of
surrounding pubs, our pene-
trating team of experts has
produced this revealing
white paper on a selection of
such local taverns.
Now read on —
Some 200 yards east of
the Southside complex are
three pubs, known as mews
pubs because of their loca-
"*s3s mm >.->
tion in the fashionable cob-
bled roads of Knightsbridge.
Ennismore
If you walk, the first you'll
reach will be the Ennismore
Arms with its polite lanterns
and dimpled windows. It's
an unassuming good to aver-
age pub having a gambling
machine at one end, an ap-
parent necessity these days,
and a comfortable bay win-
dow with seats at the other.
Its only peculiarity is the
fact that it has just one bar,

Road. All are Watney pubs.
and that could more aptly be
labelled a lounge. Alas, the
place sells no draught lager,
but does provide snacks for
those who want more than
just drink. A last word •—
beware of powerfully sprung
toilet doors.
Scurrying through a hole
in the wall further up the
mews lane, and taking a
right turn, we come across
the Prince of Wales. From
the outside it has a warm,
inviting appearance; the tin-
ted Victorian lamps light the
wrought ironwork and cop-
per fireplace. The only trait-
ors to the illusion are the
plastic bricks over a gas fire
in one of the bars. Visitors
might note the low piped
music, the Caniletto print
and the fact that like the
other mews pubs, it's a Wat-
neys house.
Nelson
The Nelson, despite hav-
ing two bars, is small and,
as the name suggests, has a
slightly nautical atmosphere.
Wooden walls are decorated
with ropes and maps and a
parish notice board is placed
by the door. Untypically
there's a dart board on one
wall, and the Nelson is prob-
ably the only mews pub
where the landlord wouldn't
flinch if you asked him for
the dominoes. For those with
their stomachs at heart, the
pub sells both draught lager
and crisps.
Southwest of 1C, not far
from Student House are the
other three pubs we re-
viewed. In the quiet part of
Gloucester Road is the Here-
ford Arms.
Another Watneys house,
it has rather monotonous
lilac decor yet is a comfor-
table pub to spend an even-'
ing. Smokers will find cigar-
ettes are only sold in twen-
ties, but this is hardly rea-
son enough to discredit the
place. However those who
drink simply to get slewed
would do best to avoid the
place.
Cheap beer
The Denmark is a fairly
large pub situated in Old
Brompton Road. It has three
bars, all elegantly decorated
in wood panelling and also
contains a restaurant. Unlike
that of the mews pubs above,
the clientele is younger and
less inhibited — making the
pub more attractive to the
average student. One other
unique feature of the pub is
the colour T V it has in the
bar; I suppose it's turned on
some times. The beer is
Courage, and at time of
writing a pint of Tavern Keg
will cost just 2/8. A fair
price for a London pub.
Anglesea
A difficult place to find
but in my opinion well worth
a visit is The Anglesea
Arms, a stone's throw from
Evelyn Gardens. The decora-
tion is rough and ready but
at the weekend the pub is
filled with young people, like
the Denmark. One attractive
aspect of the place is the re-
laxed atmosphere; the clien-
tele is very friendly and
there's singing and guitar
playing on some nights.
The inns reviewed above
are just a sample of the local
beer houses. For the con-
noisseur there are plenty
more to try which haven't
been considered simply for
lack of space. Good drink-
ing then —
Bacchus.

Brompton Road. Both are conveni-
ently near student house.
