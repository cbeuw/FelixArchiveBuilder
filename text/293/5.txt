COLCUTT
Now, you have at last rea-
lised, you are back (or for a
fresher just 'are') right in the
degree factory we all know
and love . . . Back to the
grind of lectures, lab and
exams, after a contemplative
summer on holiday where
you could reflect on your part
in last year's turbulent
changes in this great monu-
ment to technological exper-
tise.
We are back—but look
around, is it the same?
Hasn't it changed at all? The
once seeming immutable
hierachy of instruction and
non participation crumbled
slightly last year under pres-
sure.
The profs who had said
'We are masters and you are
disciples' didn't get their way,
the authorities who said 'Run
off' to the Architectural As-
sociation looked obviously
wrong. The supposedly very
conservative IC students
actually boycotted and de-
monstrated! ! These, and
other, things were of course
not fundamental changes in
IC's structure, but they re-
present important changes in
attitude—the once solid con-
crete and steel buildings now
look more like cardboard
and wood: maybe now we
can grasp 'where it's all at"
. . . It's mostly in your daily
life—in your department—
where the screws turn
tightest.
It's up to you and your
dept. and year reps to change
it there. Your reps—demo-
cratically elected by a de-
mocratically agreed process
need back-up. Some depts.
still refuse to even allow the
dept. reps to attend staff/
student committees. How
ridiculous! Who are these
fuddy-duddy empire build-
ers who believe that their self
appointed elitist hierarchies
have divine rights to ignore
us? What happens in your
dept? Will the hierachies
above us ever be made demo-
cratic—all support for the
junior staff who are working
for democracy!
There is growing dissen-
tion among staff and students
about the cliquish way in
which dept. heads are chosen.
The 4 year rotating head-
ship in maths was a step for-
ward. The present power
struggle in Physics (follow-
ing the leaving of Prof. But-
ler former Head of dept.) is
activating the junior staff
there. But will they get a real
say? When will students get
a say? And what about the
technical and secretarial
staff? The Head of dept.
after all, affects them all.
When will the financial
affairs of depts. become de-
mocratic and public?
Elementary principles of
departmental organization
are laid out in the moderate
and widely supported Union
document on the subject
(from Union Office) — now
being discussed i n depts.
When will it be fully imple-
mented in your dept? Hurry
it up!
Courses
On more about 'where it's
at', what about courses? We
cannot go on cramming
more and more irrelevant de-
tail into our heads. Throw
out detail and bring in
courses and projects of social
and political relevance which
will help us understand why
we are here and the dangers
of what we might do.
The building of democracy
in depts. will help change
courses—but we must also
have our own specific ideas,
so let the students in each
dept. work with the Union
to make alternatives.
Keep smiling with spring-
time hope.
Piers Corbyn.
NOON TODAY
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
THE SCIENTIST
This is the theme for the Com mem Day Service at
N O O N T O D A Y .
The service, which is non - denominational, is
student planned to highlight an ethical approach
to this vital question.
The preacher is M E R V Y N S T O C K W O O D , contro-
versial Bishop of Southwark.
The time : 12 noon, Thursday, 22nd October.
Holy Trinity Church, Prince Consort Road, next
to the Union.
Do my sleep filled eyes
deceive me or do I see a
bunch of new shining white
hopes for British Tech-
nology? Excuse me for not
instantly recognizing you, but
9.30 is a trifle early for
erudite observations. Permit
me to welcome you to our
hallowed halls, and of course
due to the longer hours we
shall see more of you glow-
ing examples of the high
arts of tailoring and barber-
ing! Those of you who have
been informed that your
sojourn' here is to provide
a base for antisocial political
agitation, had better hire
wigs for the early 'demos'
of the term or you may find
yourselves accused of being
'fuzz'es narks'.
The new improved open-
ing time and lengthened
hours is to allow the magic
of diversification to enter our
drab humdrum technological
existences and humanize our
innermost selves, well that's
what the bumph says! What-
ever the reason, the working
week is now five hours longer.
I am assured however that
this will not mean more
'technical' lectures being
squeezed in, because our i l -
lustrious past President has
personally told the Board of
Studies not to put in any
extra lectures. This will come
as a relief to many of us,
as we know how much atten-
tion the B.o.S. pays to Piers!
Any old lags who have to
rise early in order to make
a 9.30 start and have trouble
remembering the new start-
ing time should phone Piers
when they get up (say about
6.00 a.m.) and check.
For those gourmets who
dine in the College Block
Buttery will have noted the
beginning of term restyling,
involving the removal of
many of the tables and
chairs from the Junior Com-
mon Room, so the already
trayless diners at the Pie
and Chippie have to crush
even tighter on the in-
adequate table space or pre-
sumably sit on the floor,
although -they will no longer
have any tablecloths as there
seems to be a drastic reduc-
tion in the number of news-
papers available. The short-
age of table space is made
less acute by keeping the
queue moving very slowly,
this is accomplished by only
having one till operational.
These improvements must of
course be paid for and the
prices have in fact been in-
creased. 'Is this to cover a
pay rise for the staff?' you
may ask, well as yet the
serving staff have had no
rise and it is not exactly sur-
prising that they are hard to
come by! Some may ask why
the increase? This is pre-
sumably a price of food in-
crease, so stand by for a
'staff rise' increase in the
price of your Pie. (And a
new decimal price increase
with the introduction of
metric chips?).

Maths 2, a member of Soc-Soc and with 4 A's in the first year exams, she not just a pretty face.
