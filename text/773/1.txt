Rents in College accommodation will rise by up to £5.00 from
the start of next term. This will mean that students in Weeks,
Linstead and Southside Halls will be paying over £35 per week
for a single room.
The rent increases were approved
at the last meeting of the Student
Residence Committee (SRC) on
Wednesday. The new figures hve
been calculated by increasing the
current rents by 5 %, and then adding
a figure of £3.50 to cover the costs
of the ten new houses in Evelyn
Gardens. There is likely to be a small
adjustment to the rents for Weeks,
Linstead and Southside to make the
charge the same for all three Halls.
The substantial increases have been
expected ever since the acquisition of
the new houses in Evelyn Gardens
looked likely. Though the new rents
are a significant increase the College
is hoping that they will still be good
value for students, in anticipation of
moves by a Conservative
Government, if returned, to scrap
housing benefits for students in
private accommodation. (Students
living in College maintained Halls or
Houses are already ineligible for
Housing Benefit).
Subject to these final adjustments,
rents in Weeks (presently £31.20),
Southside (£30.00), and Linstead
(£31.00 single not including the
refectory service) will all rise by
approximately £5.00. Rents for Beit
Hall will be £32.90 for the New
Hostel and £30.07 for the Old Hostel.
In Garden Hall single, double and
triple rooms will cost £29.02, £21.25,
and £17.36 respectively. In Evelyn
Gardens a single room in one of the
' upgraded houses will now cost £29.02
and a double room £21.25. For non-
upgraded houses the rents will be
£27.34 (single), £19.57 (double) and
£15.68 (triple). In the new houses,
recendy purchased from the RCA, the
rents will be £31.33 (single), £23.45
(double) and £17.15 (triple).
The wardenship of the new Evelyn
Gardens Hostel was also discussed at
length at the Students Residence
Committee. Most members of the
Committee, including current Evelyn
Gardens wardens, are keen to see the
new accommodation divided into two
'Houses' and two new wardens
appointed. The alternative, which
appears to have the backing of
College administration, is to appoint
only one warden, who would be a
member of academic staff, and senior
to the other wardens in Evelyn
Gardens. College Assistant Secretary
Michael Arthur submitted a paper to
the meeting, supposedly outlining
both sides of the argument. A version
of this will go to the Rector's Policy
Committee under the signature of
College Secretary John Smith. Most
members of the Committee felt that
this paper was biased in favour of the
one warden option and will be
drafting a fresh document for the
Rector's Policy Committee, the Body
which will make a final decision,
though the Rector is not present
himself.
Speaking to FELIX yesterday, Mr
Arthur said that the College had to
take a "wider view" than was
represented at SRC and that it was
essential to have a senior staff warden
if he or she were to have overall
control of 600 residents.
Earlier in the week Mr Arthur
commented "I've never heard of a
six-pack, I always buy mine in
threes!" He went on to say "If Ian
Howgate were David Owen it would
increase my chances of voting
Alliance."
