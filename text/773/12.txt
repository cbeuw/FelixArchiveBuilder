Free for all
Labour will abolish museum charges
recently introduced at the Natural
History Museum in South Kensington
if they win the General Election.
Mark Fisher, Labour spokesman on
arts and media, made this pledge at
the launch of Labour Party policy on
arts and the media at the Riverside
Arts Complex to which FELIX was
invited, yesterday. It would be part
of the responsibility of a new
'Ministry of Art & Media' to increase
funding in all areas of the arts,
through 3 major channels. More
money will be put into the regional
arts associations, there will be a new
element in the Rate Support Grant to
local authorities earmarked for the
arts, and the new capital fund for arts
buildings will be set up. He stressed
that arts can make money for the
country and that over V2 million
people are currently employed in the
arts. He also said that the arts could
create 40,000 new jobs under Labour
as part of their target to make 1
million jobs in their first two years.
Labour, he claimed, would "widen
choice and open access, availability
and participation in the arts for the
public". He would not, however, put
any definite figures on the amounts
a future Labour government would
spend.
Present at the meeting to endorse
the policy were arts and media
personalities Ben Elton, Paul Weller,
Harold Pinter, Dame Peggy Ashcroft
and many others.
IC Radio computer
IC Radio has been given a multi-user
computer system on which to hold its
record catalogue. The computer was
donated by Safety Devices, a
Newmarket engineering firm, who
specialise in products for the
rallysports industry. Safety Devices
are currently running a car for Penti
Arrikalla.
IC Radio record and tape librarian
elect A l Birch said eveyone at the
station was delighted, and he
expressed the hope that the computer
would also be used for news
preparation and the promotion of
events around College.
AUT reject strike
The Association of University
Teachers last week rejected a call to
strike in protest against further cuts
and structural changes to the
university system. The motion for
strike action was narrowly defeated
by a council meeting which decided
to take "coordinated political action"
both before and after the general
election.
STOIC by satellite
Next Friday (June 5th) there will be
a live satelite link-up between
Washington and London for a
discussion about AIDS. STOIC will
be relaying the programme around the
College sets at 7.00pm, and after an
hour-long panel discussion, questions
will be invited from viewers, Imperial
College students will be able to use
the internal phone system to ask
questions of the Washington panel.
More details will be released next
week.
Tory top-ups
The Conservative Party has proposed
a new way of financing students in
higher education. The Party's
manifesto describes a 'top-up' loans
scheme to supplement student grants,
which would reduce the need for
students' overdrafts and extend
repayment time.
Mr Kenneth Baker, Secretary of
State for Education and Science, said
of the scheme, ' T want to ensure that
whatever system of student support
we have does not discourage students
from going on to higher education''.
He explained that loans would not
replace grants for this reason. The
Treasury is expected to resist the
proposal and is unlikely to make any
more money available for student
support.
The National Union of Students
described the scheme as an
acknowledgement of the inadequate
level of grants. The NUS opposes
loans on the grounds that they would
further restrict access to higher
education to disadvantaged groups.
Both the Alliance and the Labour
Party have expressed a commitment
to increasing the value of grants.
NATFHE action
Polytechnic and college lecturers
voted this week to step up industrial
action in support of their recent
20.5% pay-and-conditions claim.
Members of the National
Association of Teachers in Further
and Higher Education (NATFHE)
agreed unanimously at their annual
conference in Blackpool to start one
day action and refuse to mark exams
from September if talks have failed
by June 2nd.
The UniOh is demanding a working
week of 18 hours with time off for
lecturers involved in research and are
not prepared to accept the employers'
offer of £17,000 per annum salary for
principal lecturers. They argue that
this offer would leave them with still
considerably less money than
university lecturers.
They have accepted that this
decision was made too late to affect
exams in June and July.
Expedition
Anne-Marie Nuttal, who is currently
taking Physics at Imperial, is leading
nine colleagues up unconquered
mountains in the Karakoram range in
Kashmir this summer. She is one of
many women explorers who have
won some of the £20,000 grants from
the Royal Geographical Society. The
Society has previously helped such
names as Scott and Stanley to discover
unknown territories and is planning
to fund 60 expeditions this year.
Nationalists at
Bristol
The British Nationalist Party has
accepted an invitation to speak at the
debate at Bristol Students' Union, the
scene of a riot last year when a
meeting addressed by Mr Enoch
Powel was broken up by anarchists.
The BNP is the first extremist group
to be invited to speak at a university
since the passing of the Education Act
last year.
The debate was organised by the
Bristol Debating Society and is due
to be held (subject to committee
approval) in June. The Society's
acting chairman, Mr James Barnes,
agreed there was a risk of violence but
stated that that is no good reason not
to go ahead with the debate.
The university is to handle the
security but Mr Stuart Millson, one
of the two intended speakers, has no
confidence in this arrangement, and
said that he and his colleagues would
be "armed with a properly trained
security and stewarding force". A
spokesman for the university said that
the BNP "stewarding force" would
not be allowed on university property.
The motion for the debate is: "This
house believes that the British
National Party is the answer to
Britain's problems".
