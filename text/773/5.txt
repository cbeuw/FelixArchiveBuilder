Featura FELIX, Friday May 29th 1987
For those of you who found Chris
Edward's 'Art of Noise' feature
interesting, a sequel on samplers
follows:
A sampler uses similar technology
to a CD player, although samplers
usually use 12 bit resolution for
storing sounds in R A M with floppy
disk backup, rather than 16 bit from
an optical disk, and remember only
a few minutes of sound at best, rather
than over an hour for CDs. In the
sampler, the musician has a machine
capable of producing any sound at all,
whether a real one that has been
inputed and digitised, or a pseudoreal
one that has been created by setting
up the 'waveform R A M ' manually.
So are samplers the end of the line?
By far the most eagerly sought
electronic clone is for an acoustic
piano, and yet although we have
electronic pianos, classically trained
pianists still use those huge
temperamental pieces of furntiture
that need hours of tuning after each
removal to a new concert. Why?
You can easily take the sound of an
acoustic piano and sample it. On a
good enough machine, you can play
back the note you've just sampled and
not be able to tell the difference.
However, play a scale, and something
odd results. The sampler plays other
notes simply by playing back the
waveform data at different speeds, so
two octaves up, your sound is four
times shorter than the original. Also,
it sounds nothing like a piano would
at that pitch. The "Mickey Mouse
Effect" normally restricts single
samples \o a range of an octave at the
most. The solution is to use a multi-
sample, where you sample the piano
at several pitches, and cross-fade the
different recordings as you play up the
sampler's keyboard. You're starting
to talk big memory here, especially
if you sample all 88 notes, as you
need to for true fidelity. So you play
'Moonlight Sonata' and it still sounds
nothing like a piano. The reason why
the piano caught on in the first place,
and got its name 'pianoforte', was
because of its wide range of dynamic
expression. OK, so your sampler has
a 'velocity responsive' keyboard;
programming the thing so that a hard
pressed key = loud, and a soft
depression = quiet only slightly
allieviates the problem. Actually of
course, pressing the key harder on a
piano changes the waveform too.
Suppose you now sample a piano at
all 88 notes, and at 256 different key
velocities. Your impersonation now
begins to take in all but those who
play a piano every day, but you've
used many GIGAbytes of memory,
and you still haven't taken into
account the waveform changes of the
'loud' and 'soft' pedals, or the inter-
string resonances within the casing.
As you can see, there's a long long
way to go before you'll convince
Ashkenazy to "Go Electronic"!
Similar problems exist with other
instrument clones. A snare-drum's
waveform alters depending on how
hard you hit it, where you hit it, and
when you last hit it. A saxophone's
waveform varies with air pressure,
and the lip cheek control of the
player. Even if you could take all this
into account, you still couldn't
generate that expression from a
sampler keyboard, so why not play
a real one? Or better still, use a
saxophone to control expression on
the sampler, as AKAl's new product
does.

does today's pop star use samplers?
Of the alternatives, they can:
1) Create their own unique sounds.
Generally they're either too thick, or
haven't time, to do this.
2) Hire someone else to do it; as
on 'Slave to the Rhythm', which was
programmed by Steve Lipson, Trevor
Horn's programmer.
3) Go round with a Walkman,
recording real but unusual sounds to
sample back at home. This can be
most effective and original. Depeche
Mode's 'Black Celebration' is a
showcase for this technique.
4) Use libraries; this is what most
people do. A l l the major sampler
makers, (E-mu, KORG, Ensoniq,
AKAI, Roland, Sequential) produce
libraries of sounds on disks. It's so
easy. Just boot them up, and you've
got the result of someone's days
slaving over a computer.
Unfortunately, you've also got a one-
way ticket for the express train to
predictability; you sound like
everyone else. The success of
Oberheim's DPX-1, which can't
create new samples, but plays back
disks from other samplers shows what
most musicians want.
5) Nick sounds from records or
CD's; Illegal of course, but then who
hasn't broken the copyright act at one
time? 'Simon Le Rhodes' hears a
great bass sound on the radio, goes
out and buys the CD, samples it, and
in 5 minutes, he's using it on his next
demo.
Finally, if you're at all interested
in sound sampling, go to Tottenham
Court Road and ask for a demo of the
Casio SK-1. It's still amazing what a
less-than-£100 'toy' can do!
