Rent increases and loans Sending the boys round
It has been clear for some time that
students in College residences would
be facing substantial rent increases
next year, partly as a result of the
acquisition of the new Evelyn
Gardens Houses. It is difficult to see
how any non-sponsored student can
possibly get by on a London grant less
rent of £35 for 31 weeks, yet alone
higher rents in the private sector. This
is the sort of situation that can make
a low-interest loan scheme seem
attractive. Since nearly all students
are in debt anyway, a formalised loan
system would provide much greater
financial stability during three or four
years of undergraduate study.
Eventually, unless the present
Government is removed, students will
be dependent upon loans, whether or
not the means-tested grant is
abolished. Personally, I will never
understand why tertiary education,
like all other levels, should not be free
to everyone, or to all those who have
the ability to benefit.
This year the Print Unit has done
more private work for Union clubs
than ever before, and, strangely
enough, we have sent out more
invoices than ever before. Our rates
are such that FELIX gets practically
no financial benefit from a lot of the
smaller jobs, whereas quite a lot of
time is absorbed typesetting, pasting-
up and finishing. With only a month
to go to the end of the year there are
still a lot of clubs who have
outstanding bills which are long
overdue. If their bills are not settled
quickly there will be no further work
done in the Print Unit for any of the
offending clubs—and this policy will
be continued by next year's Editor.
It is just not worth going to the trouble
to get printing work done for people
who leave a £10 invoice unpaid for
10 months, despite reminders. I am
going to publish a full list of bad
debtors next week, and it is almost
certain to be headed by RCSU.
An apology
I should like to extend a very sincere
apology to
Steve Flower
for omitting his name from the end
of his Annual Report (SCAB
Chairman) which we printed earlier
this term. This was entirely my fault,
and not at all related to the fact that
he did not turn up to collate.
