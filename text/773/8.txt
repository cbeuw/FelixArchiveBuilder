Good morning everyone, and good
luck with your exams.
Yes, OpSoc has returned to you
from the grave where we were all
lying dead after the Marathon. This
act of charitable stupidity lasted 29
hours altogether; aaaaah. (And that's
what the singing sounded like by the
end).
We will not, however, stop because
of tiredness. On the second day after
the Marathon we had our first
rehearsal for Patience, the show we
are taking on tour to Budleigh
Salterton for a fortnight this summer.
There is a separate membership fee
for tour, and as there are no auditions
for members of the chorus, why don't
you come along each Tuesday at
7.30pm in the Music Room 53
Prince's Gate.
There is also an event arriving soon
which is open to the rest of you fools
who aren't members of this
splendiferous club; two visits to see
the English National Opera. We are
getting seats in the Upper Circle at
£10.50. The productions we intend to
see are:
Sat 13th June 7pm—Lady Macbeth
of Mtsensk-Shostakovich
Thur June 18th 7.30pm, Orpheus
in the Underworld-Offenbach
If enough people come to see
Orpheus, we may get a reduction on
the seat prices as it is one of their
'party' days (no hats provided); so all
of you out there contact P Murphy,
Civ Eng I by June 2nd, (I'm passing
the buck again).
See you at rehearsals, (by the way,
Oscar has promised to buy a drink for
the first person on the trip who knows
how to say Mtsensk).
In the 11th Century, it was
fashionable in Europe to go on
pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the Holy
Land. It was a long and difficult
journey, but the route there was kept
open by the Byzantine Empire and the
Moslems, who held Jerusalem,
tolerated the pilgrims. But in the
second half of the century, the Selljuk
Turks invaded the Byzantine Empire
and took Jerusalem from the more
tolerant Moslems who had held it
previously. The Turks harassed and
maltreated the pilgrms and this,
coupled with calls for help from the
Byzantines, gave rise to the crusades.
Thousands of people in Europe
took the cross and an expedition was
organised which in 1099, captured
Jerusalem. Four crusader states were
thus established in the Holy Land.
Who went on crusade and why did
they do it? Firstly, a great number of
common people took the cross mainly
out of genuine religious zeal, but there
were other factors: Life for common
people in Europe at the time was very
grim. The vast majority were peasants
who were at the mercy of a harvest
that regularly failed, and of private
wars between the barons in which
their crops were burned, their hovels
raided and their relatives carried off
into slavery or simply murdered. The
other main group who went crusading
were the lesser nobility. Though
religion also played a part, they went
to get new lands in the East. They
were mainly the younger sons of great
barons who were unlikely to succeed
to any lands in Europe. Indeed, many
of the crusaders were Normans,
whose kin had recently conquered
England for precisely that reason.
Once the four crusading states had
been set up, but what later became
known as the First Crusade, many of
the crusaders felt they had done their
bit and went home. The states, the
Kingdom of Jerusalem, the
Principality of Antioch and the
counties of Tripoli and Edessa, had
to be defended with a very small
number of men. To do this, the
cursaders built many castles. Since
the lack of water and the heat of the
East made it difficult to keep armies
in the field for long, siege warfare
was very important and the walled
cities and castles were thus more
formidable and bigger than those in
Europe.
The Land Beyond the Sea or
Outremer, as it was called in medieval
French, was always short of men.
Few enough had stayed in the Holy
Land after the first crusade, but the
shortage was aggravated by the fact
that the crusaders knew little about
sanitation, and while they could get
away with their habits in Europe, they
died of every kind of disease in the
heat of the East.
One of the ways used to combat the
manpower shortage was the
foundation early on in crusading
history of the military orders. These
were religious order of knights sworn
to poverty, chastity and obedience and
to defending the holy places.
European nobles, rather than
undertaking the difficulty and expense
of crusading themselves, could salve
their consciences by endowing one of
the military orders. They were also
excellent ways of getting restless and
troublesome younger sons out of the
way. The military orders soon
became rich, with assets all over
Europe as well as in Outremer. The
main orders were the Templars and
Hospitallers. It is from the Templars
that the well known image of the
knight with a red cross on a white
surcoat originated. The Hospitallers
were a white cross on black.
Sometime after the foundation of the
Templars and Hospitallers, German
crusaders, who felt that these orders
were dominated too much by the
French, founded a third order, the
Teutonic Knights
The history of civilisation goes
back a lot further in the levant than
in Europe, and when the crusaders
first arrived, they were regarded as
uncultured barbarians even by the
native christians whom they had
liberated from Moslem rule.
Moreover, the native christians who
had been living in the Holy Land
since the time of Christ followed a
slight different creed from the
crusaders and this added to the
friction.
The precariousness of their
situation meant that the crusading
states could not last long. In 1187 the
Moslems under Aaladin recaptured
Jerusalem after the disastrous battle
of Hattin. This finished the Kingdom
of Jerusalem after only eighty-eight
years. It provoked the Third Crusade,
which though it failed to recover
Jerusalem, prolonged the crusader's
existence for another hundred years.
Over the hundred years, what was left
of crusaders' lands was gradually
whittled away, until in 1291, the last
crusader town fell.
The crusaders make a wonderful
story and have left their mark on
Palestine in the shape of many
spectacular ruins. But it must not be
forgotten that they were essentially a
great act of intolerance that did no one
any long term good.
