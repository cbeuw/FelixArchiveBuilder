The first act I saw that night was well
and truly offputting. They were so
dreadful that I can't even remember
what they were called—the only thing
that sticks in my mind is the sound
of booing as they went into their third
chorus of "Daddy wouldn't buy me
a bowwow", and the booing was far
more tuneful than the singing.
At the end of the act I was about
ready to leave, and I reckon the rest
of the crowd were in the same state,
but by common consensus we decided
to give the next act a chance, and just
as well. Two gallant members of
ENTS. who shall remain nameless,
comandeered the stage complete with
guitars and gave us fifteen most
worthwhile minutes of obscenity and
rough and ready music which well
outclassed the previous lot—credit
must go to these people for saving the
evening.
Having held onto the crowd,
preventing mass exodus, our heroes
left the stage to Tom McEwan, who
was fantastic. His opening number
seemed a bit doubtful, with fair guitar
playing and mucho gutso on the
mouthorgan, but from then on he just
got better, giving us a superb line in
dry Scots humour and a good
selection of music, illustrating quite
a talent on both instruments and
coping very well with the one idiot
who had to heckel. At the end of his
spot he was called back by loud roars
for an encore, and all I can say is that
Romeo and Juliet will never sound the
same again.
After the excellent Mr McEwan it
looked as if the last act, Steve
Rawlings, had a tough one to follow,
but he did it. The best way of
describing him is as a juggler with the
ooper touch for mayhem:
getting it wrong to order is probably
harder than getting it right, and Steve
did his share of both. The culmination
of his act involved fire and wine
glasses, eliciting oohs and aahs all
over the place and leaving his
assistant lost for words. He too was
called back for more, and he didn't
disappoint.
Summing up, we had an excellent
time, only marred at the start by those
music hall twits, who deserved a
much nastier reception than they got.
Full marks, ENTS!

comes
to work
Who misdirected this early morning Commuter?
Somewhere between the Serpentine
And St James' it had turned right
When it should have kept its slow
Laboured line.
But it flopped thump, bump into the glass screen
Beyond my desk.
It had been mobbed
Robbed, raped more like it
By a gang of crows.
Inexpressibly alien:
All morning long,
From log-on time to coffee
It sulked. Chin on breast, shoulders hunched
From it tormentors
In a corner of the concrete yard,
Like a masai warrior in a bus station,
White riffling against the grey
Currents of its neck
Its breast.
The hard bead of its eye
Clicking.
All morning long,
It took in management science lectures,
Nuclear power seminars, the mixed chaff
Of undergraduates between classes, until
The windows began to open too often
And the voices rang out too loudly. Then
It rose, swaying over the narrowed street.
Would that passers-by had hid
From its enourmous shadow.
Would that the street had stopped
To gasp 'Ah',
But I doubt it did.

The Sex Pistols—The Inside Story
by Fred & Judy Vermorel
Omnibus Press, £5.95
Was it really only ten years ago? This
book is the nearest the Sex Pistols got
to telling their own story (where have
I heard that before?) and includes
interviews, press cuttings and extracts
from the Sex Pistols' secretary's
diary. The first half of the book deals
with "The Story"—the early days,
the Grundy interview, signing to
EMI, signing to A & M , signing to
Virgin, getting Sid Vicious, losing
DRUGS 'N
Sid, and then killing off the group.
There is then a section on the
characters involved—extracts from
Paul Cook's school reports, and
photos of Sid Vicious as a kid at the
zoo, and then a 'What a wonderful
year that was' piece lamenting the
death of punk.
The best parts of the book are those
that deal with Malcolm Maclaren, Sex
ROCK N
Pistol's manager/svengali, simply
because he is the most interesting
character involved. Otherwise, one is
left with the impression that the
authors are on a crusade to make the
rest of the band into something they
never were—spokesmen for a
generation.
Paul Cook and Steve Jones come
over as just a couple of guys doing
SEX N
a job, Sid as a rather naive, but
optimistic junkie, Glen Matlock (their
first bassist) as a victim of John
Lydon, and Lydon (ne Rotten) is just
another pop star with a personality
problem. The diary extracts give us
lots of incidental information (Lydon
was hounded by his dentist, Sid was
'a really sweet guy', Glen Matlock
bought a Sunbeam Alpine car), but
ROLL
nothing new, nothing that has not
already been written into the history
of that year.
This is a book, then, aimed at fans,
or fanatics—interesting but not
crucial. "The majority of men and
women live their lives in quiet
desperation, The Sex Pistols lived
their lives in loud desperation."
Pete Wilson
