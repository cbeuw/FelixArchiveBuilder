GaySoc
Defended
Dear Dave,
Why are students at this College so
paranoid about homosexuality?
Homosexuality has always been
present in our society and
undoubtedly it will continue to be so.
If we acknowledge or accept
homosexuals as a part of our society
will it corrupt us all? Are we going
to become 'bent' because we hear a
gay song, see a gay play, read a gay
book or. my God. actually meet a ga\
person?
The establishment of a GaySoc at
IC should be supported for 2 reasons:
1. It provides a supportive outlet for
gay students to express themselves.
2. With time (centuries?) it should
be seen by all IC students as just
another society which caters for the
interests of a minority (ArtSoc exists
to give theatre-lovers the chance to
'come out' and say they enjoy going
to see Shakespeare. Hopefully they
are not classified as abnormal just
because some IC student's idea of a
good night out is 16 pints of lager,
a vindaloo and a voluminous
throw-up).
Since leaving the ignorant shores of
Ireland (where, as you know,
everybody lives in big happy families
with at least 13 children and
homosexuality does not even exist) I
have been constantly shocked by
reports of child abuse, wife-battering,
rape within marriage, incest, child
prostitution, paedophilia, abortion
and divorce. These, Mr Thomis, are
the horrifying threats to 'the family
unit' in our society today, not
homosexuality.
I hope to God that people of our age
and education can see the difference
between acts of sexual violence and
expressions of sexuality.
Yours sincerely,
David Currey, Software
Engineering (Chairman of
ArtSoc)
Prejudice
Attacked
Dear Dave,
I would like to add my 2p-worth to
the 'gay-rights' debate. People have
prejudices. The mood around College
at the moment is that these are in some
way wrong—a sickness to be cured.
I do not agree with this. People eat
meals and enjoy them—but when they
are told what was in it, they change
their mind—a result of human
prejudice. We all know what we find
attractive in the people we meet—and
we all exercise our prejudices in
sifting friends from our aquaintances.
'Homophobia' and racism are
prejudices which are unpopular
because most people cannot
sympathise with them. However if a
racist wishes to avoid the company of
the races he dislikes then good for
him, because to attempt to overcome
his feelings would create tension and
difficulties—and the same goes for
'homophones'. When these people go
out 'queer bashing' or 'nigger
bashing' is when it all become
abhorrent.
Open expression of prejudice is
often damaging and hurtful, but the
feelings themselves are not. The
! biggest mistake of the lot is to attempt
; to ignore or fight our prejudices.

Procreation
Revisited
Dear Dave,
The arguments over the rights and
wrongs in the "gay rights" issue
continue. We do at least seem to have
some agreement that sex and love are
different things and that it is possible
for sexual desire to be inappropriate.
It is surely true, I would add, that
simply because we are in love with
someone we cannot treat all possible
resultant physical actions towards that
person as true and appropriate
expressions of our love; some can
definitely be quite the opposite.
As I have argued before (May 15th)
I certainly don't think the evaluation
of the Tightness or wrongness of
anything (especially where there is
dispute and we propose to publicly
push our ideas) can proceed purely
from the basis of personal experience
without attempting to reasonably
become a bit more 'sure' (ref Andrew
Bannister May 22nd) that our feelings
are good and ordered. Even (indeed
especially) 'love' itself, if we really
believe it is more than the
meaningless result of some random
atom barging, should not I think be
let loose to be talked about and
nurtured just in the context of the
apparent 'instincts' of individuals.
Perhaps the sheer biological
purpose of sex, that is for procreation
(something very clearly acknow-
ledged in the life cycles of the animal
kingdom), is something we should
bring into the discussion. Procreation
is of course inherent to the survival
of the special and so, for the
evolutionists among us, this purpose
explains the physical pleasure
associated with sex. Human beings of
course bring in the infinitely higher
level of love, but in noting that we
should also be careful to note that we
can certainly beautifully express love
and become very close to a person
without having to use the particular
physical expression which is having
sex with him/her/them (or even
experiencing sexual desire—though it
may, perhaps inappropriately and
regretably, force it's way in). Love
does not depend upon any particular
physical expression. Perhaps, then,
we can see sex in the human species
as, by design, an expression of love
which wants to create (and so bring
up) another person—a completely
committed and totally unselfish love
that is—crowned with the physical
pleasure which is there, after all,
because the act is that which
procreates. Sex outside of this
context, then, can become an untruth.
A lack of love or of the procreative
potential places the sexual pleasure
outside of the context of what it
means, of what it says.
If we really believe in the existence
and value of human love and want to
share true love I submit that some of
the above considerations are relevant.
Yours sincerely,

RCSU:
Hacking Itself
to Bits?
Dear Dave,
Sad though it is to have to air one's
dirty laundry in public the question
has to be asked. What has RCSU done
to itself?
A once proud and happy union has
been plummetted to the depths of
shattered egos, petty bickering and
worst of all, it's losing any sense of
humour.
This year has seen a series of
attacks from certain prominent RCSU
officers (and non-officers) on a group
of people who have, on the whole,
had no means of reply. Their general
good nature has meant that they
haven't really been bothered and the
attacks aren't really going to change
their lives. However, what type of
image is all this vitriolic back-
stabbing giving the RCSU; it's not
exactly showing it to be a bundle of
laughs is it? Who is going to get
involved with a group of people who
spend their whole time slagging each
other off in public?
Over the months we have seen
numerous attacks on so called hacks,
both old and new. Can I point out to
these 'non-hacks' that without the
support of these people, especially the
older variety, there would have been
no drivers for Rag Tour, the Smoking
Concert would have lost some of its
best acts, their would have been
nobody to clean after many of the
major events of the year. Many of
these people were the ones who kept
the 1,000,001 darts going and Jez
would have stayed in her garage until
after Easter if it wasn't for them. I
could go on but what's the point? The
people who have initiated this hate
campaign are set in their ways
they've got it into their minds from
somewhere that 'hacks' are a bad
idea. It's pointless explaining what
has been there to be seen by anyone
who cared enough to look the
controversy over.
"Not Broadsheet" is just another
example of the way the life blood of
RCSU is blackening. Over a number
of years, the helpers on Broadsheet
have produced the occasional spoof-
issue, the purpose of which has been
just for a little fun at the end of the
year.
Some of us, this year, decided it
would be quite a novel surprise to ask
one of the most notable of the recent
past editors to edit this special edition.
Given the noticeable absence this
term, of Broadsheet, it was felt that
a number of things had to be said
before many students disappeared
after/before exams. The publication
wasn't meant to offend; quite the
contrary, it went out of its way to
praise the official editor. As to
whether the principle was
constitutional, the content of
Broadsheet is at the (official) editor's
discretion, and thus not at her dictate.
It is appreciated that some of the
material was controversial, however,
if a publication goes out of its way not
to offend anyone, it soon becomes
very stagnant and obviously boring.
Because a number of people on IC
Council share a particular belief, it is
automatically assumed that other
groups with opposing points of view
should keep silent, and that anv
mention of such opinions is strictly
taboo. I don't believe this to be true.
Having read this week's official
Broadsheet and heard the judgements
of the RCS president and president-
elect, and also having talked to many
'average' students, I believe the
publication of Not Broadsheet was
justified. In fact general support for
it was positive, perhaps the powers
that be should think carefully about
this discontinuity. The current
hierachy promised to change RCSU,
they seem to be doing quite nicely.
That much vaunted war-horse, the
constitution says RCSU should
' 'promote social intercourse between
students", and also ex-students. The
only change that has been brought is
sadly towards social discourse.
The spirit of RCSU is slipping fast.
The political bullshit should be left to
ICU etc. Why can't those who are
involved with RCSU drop their
mission to change the universe,
because they'll never do it, they just
need to relax and enjoy what there is
to be appreciated, they are missing
out on an awful lot of fun.
There should indeed be room for
both camps to be allowed to exist
together. If everyone continues the
way they are going, both sides will
become so bitterly intrenched, any
spirit of enjoyment will disappear
forever, and RCS will have died—
please don't do that!
Yours sincerely,
David H Williams
