Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday M a y 2 9 t h 1 9 8 7 4
I'd rather have a cup of tea
It occurs to me that there are only
about three issues of FELIX left to go
before the end of the year. Only three
more ever-receding deadlines to meet,
only three more chances to provoke
a bit of hate-mail (it's been a bit thin
on the ground recently). So here
goes...
Last Thursday as I was crossing
Beit Quadrangle early in the afternoon
I happened to witness the "initiation
ceremony" of 'Links' the all-male tie
club of City and Guilds. Various
people were hopping round the quad,
drinking pints of beer in one go and
sometimes bringing them straight
back up again. As I watched one
particular specimen, wearing only a
jock-strap, heaving his guts up over
a bush, it occurred to me that although
I've seen this sort of thing several
times during my four years at
Imperial, I still fail to understand why
this particular group of students feel
they have the right to impose such
disgusting and anti-social behaviour
on the rest of the College community.
If there is anyone who finds this kind
of thing justifiable perhaps they would
be so good as to enlighten me.
Whilst on the subject of organised
alcohol abuse; earlier in the year I was
invited to the annual dinner of another
well-established social club by a very
dear friend. I went along and enjoyed
the company and the food, but found
the evening dominated by the
obsession with alcohol. People stood
on chairs to drink 'penalty pints'
whilst the assembled company
cheered and jeered. The climax of the
evening came when the president of
the club drank three pints of beer
"down-in-one" from the three-
handled pot. This feat was regarded
with considerable admiration, it was
also followed by the inevitable
consequences. Needless to say. by the
end of the night, various bits of the
Union Building bore witness to the
fact that many stomachs could not
cope with the abuse they had been put
through.
Of course organised drinking is not
just a feature of the Links and Diggers
clubs but is prevalent in many
organisations throughout College.
Many of these groups have their
positive sides, promoting friendship
and doing worthwhile work, but the
negative side can't be ignored.
I still fail to understand it. Alcohol
is a drug and a poison. Many people,
including myself, choose to use it and

occasionally may abuse it. It is quite
probable that a lot of people at
Imperial are dependent on alcohol
without realising it. (If you drink a
few pints regularly, this could include
you.) Is institutionalising the regular,
systematic abuse of a drug like this
really acceptable? Surely if an
individual wishes to poison
themselves with alcohol that's their
problem—until it makes them
offensive to other people in which
case a serious re-think is called for.
Making it acceptable—and even
desirable—for people to push
themselves to the limits of their
tolerance of the drug, on a regular,
organised basis, seems irresponsible
to say the least. Call me a hypocrite
if you like, but I feel that there's a
world of difference between
individuals having a drink together
and a club which includes systematic
alcohol abuse in its constitution.
When I was eight or nine my
friends and I formed a succession of
clubs with entry conditions and
initiation ceremonies of varying
degrees of silliness. However for
sheer mindless stupidity some of the
things I have seen here outclass my
childish antics by at least a factor of
ten.
I make no apology for saying things
which have been said before. It's an
opinion which is highly unpopular in
some quarters; but it's one which has
been re-inforced by a year around the
Union Building, seeing, again and
again, how apalling the effects of
alcohol can be.
On a different note
We're still looking for individuals and
societies to help out at the 'Family
Day' on June 21st. If anyone has ideas
or can spare some time to help out at
this 'carnival' for staff, students and
their families, to be held on the
Queen's Lawn, come and see me for
details.
That's it for now,
