Reviews
There is a slightly arrogant
assumption that only Western culture
post 1500 produced works of art on
a grand scale. Both exhibitions on at
the Royal Academy of Arts gainsay
this; one is a display of jewellery from
the third Millenium BC to the seventh
century AD in the regions that stretch
from Greece to Afghanistan and from
the Caucasus Mountains in the USSR
to Egypt. The second is the well
publicised exhibition of icons and
frescoes from the Greek culture of
Byzantium and Crete, mostly
pre-1450.
The jewellery ranges from crude
flattened discs of gold to beautiful
wreaths of gold oak or laurel leaves,
complete with acorns and jewelled
flowers, made for victorious athletes
or for funerals. There are two
hundred and fifty necklaces, earings,
buttons, rings, diadems, neck torques,
beads and flowers on display plus a
very learned commentary on trade
routes, migrations, techniques etc,
and you can have a good laugh at all
the art students saying "Gosh—how
fascinating—is it cast or repousee?".
My favourite bits were two lapis
lazuli pommel ends or knife handles,
shaped like snarling tiger heads.
The Icons are more interesting than
the jewellery, although they range
over a shorter period and smaller
area. The exhibition is designed to
show how art developed in the eastern
half of the Mcditeiannean, finishing
with Ihe painter Kl Greco, who
became a Renaissance artist in Spain
and Italy. Although the lighting is
dim, the bright colours and detail of
the icons are astonishing. They are
either small icons for private prayer
or large ones for processions or the
walls of churches. Favourites are
Madonna's and Jesus's, with some
local saints thrown in, such as St
George and St Demetius, who were
a kind of holy SAS—killing dragons
and rescuing slaves; or St Nicholas,
who also went around rescuing people
condemned to execution and paying
poor girls' dowries all shown in
picture stories.
The sore points about the Royal
Academy are its high charges (£1.70
for each exhibition) and the poor
quality of some of its postcards. There
are, however, numerous free galleries
around like the Tate or National, plus
the small private galleries.
I visited Jake Sutton's exhibition at
the Francis-Kyle Gallery, 9 Maddox
St, expecting it to be a breath of fresh
air, but whilst appreciating his bright
colours and lively scenes his pictures
were all a bit same-y. There are about
forty on show, mostly watercolours
ranging from £500 to £1500—but the
entrance is free. The scenes are jolly:
boating on the river, circuses. Punch
and Judy shows, a day at the races,
steamboats and flowers; the sort of
optimistic, pretty art that the British
Middle Classes can hang on the wall
without getting a guilty conscience.
Perhaps (hat's why he never paints the
faces in—he's hinting at the
emptynoss of all this materialism.
Nevertheless it's very jolly art—the
watcrlillics arc particularly lovely and
some of the close-up sketches of
trapeze artists and jockeys were
exhilarating—but still no faces. He is
reminiscent of Raoul Duty; colourful
and a situation briskly filled in with
a few strokes, but with this difference;
Dufy hangs in the Tate and Sutton
doesn't. (Yet). Postcards are
available.

The Chelsea Pot
If ever you are stuck with only £2.00
in your pocket, feeling desperately
hungry and are too lazy to cook, then
head for the Chelsea Pot (Kings
Road). One of a chain of 'Pots', this
restaurant serves just about the
cheapest food that rates as food. The
service is non-existent and the food
isn't really much above good
refectory standard, but the place has
a distinct charm which is all its own
and always seems to attract a good
selection of pseudo-nutters.
Favourites include Moussaka (£1.50,
or thereabouts) and Chicken
something-or-other (who cares?). At
least it gets you out for the evening.
Good for street cred.

Cheap places to eat in London are
becoming few and far between these
days. Most students face bills of £5
a head in even the best local
eateries—and that's without the drink.
One exception to this is the Won Kei
in Soho where the average oriental
blow out comes to about £4 with
Chinese tea included. Many of you
will have already visited this popular
restaurant for a club dinner or before
visiting any one of the numerous
theatres on Shaftsbury Avenue. Like
the Texas Lone Star it makes its
money by turning over as many
people as possible in one night. Be
prepared for poor service—they won't
serve you if you sit down before they
show you to a place. It's terribly noisy
as Chinese instructions are shouted
backwards and forwards across the
rooms. Not a place for a nice intimate
evening. The food arrives within five
minutes of ordering and the bill within
one minute of finishing.
The menu contains over 70 Chinese
dishes but most prefer to opt for the
set meals at £3.80 per person (20p
extra for egg fried rice). These
include the favourites: Sweet and
Sour Pork, Chicken with Cashew
Nuts, Beef in Black Bean Sauce and
Mixed Stir Fried Vegetables served
up with generous portions of rice.
If you want to vary this a little then
you can choose soup noodles, ho fun
and crispy noodles (I have to
recommend the Barbeque Pork
Noodle especially).
Before visiting the Won Kei, make
sure that you've got enough cash
because they don't accept anything
else (except for doing the washing up
of course).
