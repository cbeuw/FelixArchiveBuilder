F E L I X . N O V E M B E R 5th 1976
Linstead Hail
Once again L i n s t e a d H a l l has
hit the headlines, a s it d i d on the
29th January this year with the
L i n s t e a d benefaction., T o p i c , the
College paper, i s a l s o ding its first
article since February on the
extension plans.
There was some causetic feedback
on my editorial a fornight ago, when
I announced that F E L I X would be
doing a feature o n the e x t e n s i o n .
However, nobody h a s refuted my
suggestion that more open C o l l e g e
d i s c u s s i o n is needed on the subject
of the proposed building.
But, when y o u d o start to wade
through the plans for such an
immense project y o u realise perhaps
why. T h e task i s daunting i n that we
now have three plans and a n awful
lot of controversy as to how we should
go about spending the benefactor's
money.
I have seen a l l three p l a n s . L i k e
the Department of Architecture and
P l a n n i n g at Westminster C i t y C o u n c i l ,
I am not particularly impressed with
the low rise idea, on principle. In
this respect I like the C o l l e g e p l a n s ,
although I may w e l l find c a u s e t o
grumble at some of the sematics
later o n .
Nevertheless in a building of
this s i z e on this tight a budget
(£350,000) compromises have to be
made. The great thing i s that C o l l e g e
is doing what it c a n to get more
desperately needed accommodation.
It's a great pity that' they have been
thwarted over planning permission
for the present time; let us hope they
can salvage something.
Sports Editing
E d i t i n g articles i s a necessary
e v i l ; theoretically, and i d e a l l y , I
should not even need to look at the
grammar, spelling and punctuation of
submitted articles., let alone, a s i n
many cases rewrite them totally s o
they make sense to the reader a n d
V a r i t y p i s t .
In reply (o my D a v y ' s letter (page
10), I do not aim to limit sport to one
page of F E L I X . If good l i v e l y material
is submitted on time then I w i l l print
it with f e w , if a n y , alterations.
However each article has to earn i t s
place in F E L I X — hence the two
soccer articles printed last .week.
Nevertheless some planning i s
necessary, otherwise the paper would
always be out T u e s d a y . Hence I have
to decide early in the week (after
2pm Monday) as to what space e a c h
section i s getting. If that section
overruns its "quota then articles get
chopped by editing out paragraphs.
A t least, though, I managed to preserve
half of your, (Mr D a v y ' s ) a r t i c l e and"
it did make s e n s e . Others in other
sections weren't s o lucky.
Regarding the What's O n and
reviews sections, might I point o u t
that F E L I X has to cater for other
tastes than yours Mr p a v e y .
Mascots
Let me endorse the RCS view
that mascotry should not endanger
life and / or limb. I hope that
RCS will stick to this principle as
Boch as they expect Guilds to.

Thes* ate now available from the

the job of compiling the column, so
we'd be grateful if people would
use them.
Slop Shirts
Contrary to popular belief neither

P r i n c e s Gardens. L i n s t e a d ,
Southside and Weeks H a l l s
house 590 people.
Both of the alternative
schemes put foward are of a
low rise nature, and cover
only the area now occupied
by games courts and the c a r
park to the north of the
L i n s t e a d calorific chamber.
Under the Knightsbridge
A s s o c i a t i o n plan seven
games courts would form> the
north and west perimeters of
this a r e a . O n top of this
would be seven 2-storey
maisonettes each containing
rooms for nine students." The
area behind the maisonettes
would be used to provide three
tennis courts, under which
would be a c a r park. O n the
northside of the Square there
would be further 2-storey
maisonettes above the Sports
Centre. These would accom-
modate sixty students. In
front of these would be a
conservatory.
The scheme from Professor
Wiggins is based on a
collegiate staircase principle
favoured by Oxford and
Carnbrdige c o l l e g e s . T h e
present c a r park and games
court area would contain nine
accommodation blocks each
of three or four storeys. Rooms
would be let off the central
staircase at half floor
intervals. Professor Wiggins
and h i s architect, Stephen
Gardiner, believe that the
courtyard atmosphere created
w i l l enhance s o c i a l life and
provide more attractive
accommodation. E a c h block
has a roof garden on top,
w h i c h i s sheltered from the
north by mezzanire s e c t i o n s .
The scheme accommodates
280 students and extra common
rooms are e n v i s a g e d . T h e
first stage of this proposal
involves the construction of
three b l o c k s .
So? w h i l s t the C o l l e g e
plans have been rejected,
the debate as to what is right
and proper for the square
goes o n . On the one. hand
C o l l e g e , its architects, and
the D A P W C a l l support a
medium to high rise develop-
ment, which would not, they
c l a i m , introduce a third style
of architecture into P r i n c e s
Gardens. -On the other' side
are the Knightsbridge
A s s o c i a t i o n a n d Professor
Wiggins who seperately argue
for a low rise development
of two to four floors, and that
a new architectural style c a n
be introduced.
Density problems
Further argument centres
around the number of students
that ought to be accommodated
in the new b u i l d i n g s . C o l l e g e ,
its architects, the D A P W C C
and P r o f e s s o r Wiggins s a y
that a density of 200 persons
per acre (ppa) i s not i n -
appropriate for student
accommodation. T h e proposed
L i n s t e a d extension would
bring the density up to 170—
180ppa, T h e Knightsbridge
A s s o c i a t i o n quote the G L C
Development P l a n recommend-
ation of 85—lOOppa for
'domestic accommodation'.
Their proposals for the
square are based on a density
of 90ppa„ A g a i n s t this the
D A P W C C comment that
85—lOOppa 'is not considered
an appropriate yardstick in
this case'.
N
o g
o to low rise
T h e D A P W C C a l s o come
out against a low rise develop-
ment for the square i n their
report to the P l a n n i n g
Committee (paragraph 16):
With regard to the character
of Princes Gardens, on one
would doubt that the compon-
ents of that character are
strong, whether they be the
existing, though much disliked,
post war College development;
the listed terraces on the
west and north side or the
fine, matur.e and in some
cases 90 foot high, plane trees.
The central garden is also
large in scale and the entire
Square represents a simple
and bold. statement which
requires to be completed
on the east side in a way
which a small scale low
rise development would not
resolve. It is far this reason
that at no. stage have the
architects to the college
been advised to do other than
conform to the lines of the
Square, in order to retain
the essential characteristic
enclosure which is typical of
the London Squares.
L o c a l residents had said
that the C o l l e g e plans were
'hideous' a n d 'inappropriate
for the square'.
A t present the C o l l e g e i s
waiting for the d e c i s i o n to
be officially communicated
to them before deciding on
further action. It seems l i k e l y ,
though, that the Board of
Governors, who meet on
November 19th, w i l l be left
to decide what happens next.
