Right Wing Dentistry
Imperial 1st XI 2 v Kings College 1st XI 0
Imperial C o l l e g e ' s first
team followed up their 7—2 c u p
win over C h e l s e a with this
w e l l deserved victory over
Kings on Wednesday.
IC began the game very
s l o w l y and for the first twenty
minutes the match w a s very
scrappy. However, towards the
end of the half I C settled down-
and started to look dangerous
with a series of right wing
a s s a u l t s on the K i n g s ' defence.
From one such attack a d i v i n g
attempt by Ian Huntingdon
went just w i d e .
Despite a couple of melees
in the K i n g s goalmouth the
half-time score remained at 0-0,
In the second half I C
continued to dominate the game.
In fact, wit h Andy Baker and
Dave Brabbin i n complete
control at the back, .Kev
A l l e n hardly had to make a
save throughout the second
half.
I C opened the scoring with
a fine move down the right
w i n g , Terry L i n d o n sent over a
perfect cross and there was
Ian Huntingdon — recently
reinstated into the forward
line after some trouble with
his dentist — to score with
a fine right foot shot. From
this point I C did not look
back, their lead w a s soon
increased when Steve B a t e s
c r o s s e d the b a l l , again from
the right w i n g , and Gareth
Roberts ghosted i n at the
near post to score with a
glancing header.
I C continued to search
for goals and were unlucky not
to increase their tally. One
move i n particular deserved a
better fate; Steve G e e centred
to the near post, Terry Grim-
wade f l i c k e d it o n , and there
was Terry L i n d o n to hit a
stunning left foot v o l l e y
w h i c h w a s magnificently
turned away by the goalkeeper.
The last 10 minutes saw
the game degenerate into a
series of petty incidents. Ian
Huntingdon had a disagreement
with a K i n g s defender and
tried ( u n s e c c e s s f u l l y ) to ensure
that he too would v i s i t the
dentist. T h i s was followed
by the K i n g s captain being
sent off for questioning the
referee's parentage (That's a
cute w a y of putting " i t — E d ) .
Nevertheless I C kept their
grip on the game and claimed
another two valuable points.
Team: Kev Allen, Chris Howley,
Dave Brabbin, Andy Baker, Rob
Young, Steve Grimwade,
Gareth Roberts, Terry Lindon,
lan Huntingdon, Steve Gee.
