No. 433 Friday. 5 November. 1976 F R E E !
Knightsbridge residents submit their plan for Linstead extension
Linstead Hall
plans rejected
College plans for an extension to Linstead Hall have
been rejected unanimously by the Town Planning Committee
of Westminster City Council. This was despite a recom-
mendation by the Council's own Department of Architecutre
and Planning (DAPWCC) that the college scheme be
approved.
There are now serious fears that the college w i l l lose its
anonymous benefaction to build the hall should they f a i l to be
'in a position to start building on the (extension) sire by January
1977', T h e i t a l i s e d words indicate a condition imposed by the
benefactor on the £350,000 made a v a i l a b l e to build the e x t e n s i o n .
Strong opposition to the
new building h a s been voiced
by the local Knightsbridge
A s s o c i a t i o n a n d a l o c a l
resident, Professor Wiggins,
of Bedford C o l l e g e . Both
have extensively lobbied
Planning Committee members
with objections to the height
of the new building (seven
storeys instead of the
original L i n s t e a d ' s ten) and
the density of student
numbers i n the P r i n c e s
square. Alternative proposals
for the east side of the
Square have been drawn up
for the Professor by architect
Steven Gardiner, architectural
correspondent of the Observer
newspaper. T h e s e have not
been submitted as a planning
application, whereas the
Knightsbridge A s s o c i a t i o n
recently drawn-up scheme has

Observers at the meeting

officially rejected o n the
grounds of height and general
architectural grounds.
Disgusted
Reaction to the rejection
has varied from amazement to
d i s a p p o i n t m e n t . Union
President N i c k Brayshaw w a s
among the first -to comment:
'I'm absolutely digusted
I'm left with a feeling of total
amazement. In my view the
members of the Planning
Committee have not considered
the Imperial College view
fairly.' C o l l e g e Secretary
Mr Davies was more reserved:
'The decision is of course,
to put it mildly, a .great
disappointment.'
Deadline extension
Professor Wiggins w a s a
little more forthright: 'College
has made an error of judgement
and it is sad that they have.
They've known for some time
that their design was disliked,
Tv*e yet to find a member of
College who says the rejected
design was beautiful or good
value for money.'
On a more hopeful note he
continued, 'I'm sure the
benefactor, who offered money
to my own College, will
extend the deadline, as he
did several times for us.'
Two proposals
The C o l l e g e had submitted
two proposals for P r i n c e ' s
Gardens to the C o u n c i l ' s Town
P l a n n i n g Committee. T h e
first was a n 'outline' proposal
for the development, in five
p h a s e s , of the remaining
sites in the gardens; the
second w a s a detailed
proposal for phase one of this
scheme, a n extension to
L i n s t e a d H a l l on top of
the present calorifier chamber.
Although not strictly in the
same style as the original
building, the extension would
follow the gallery l i n e s of
the original building. Study
bedrooms would be on each
floor i n groups of four or f i v e ,
each with its own bath,
shower, WC and cooking
f a c i l i t i e s . Three such groups
would be on each communal
corridor. Other communal and
catering f a c i l i t i e s would be
supplied by the e x i s t i n g
L i n s t e a d H a l l .

provide rooms for 95 students
in single and double rooms.
T h e full scheme provides
rooms for 581 extra students,
373 of them on the eastern
side of the square.
Prior to the meeting the

C o u n c i l to reject the outline
proposals.
