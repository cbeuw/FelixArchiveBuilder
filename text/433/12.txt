Edinburgh
quits NUS
In a referendum last
F r i d a y , the students of
Edinburgh University voted
by 1,894 to 1,675 to d i s -
affiliate from N U S .
T h i s d e c i s i o n , made by a
high 33% turn-out, h a s
deprived N U S of £12,000 pa
(2.7% of i t s income) as w e l l
as 10,000 members.
Of the eight Scottish
u n i v e r s i t i e s , Strathclyde,
Glasgow and St Andrews
were already outside N U S ,
whilst Dundee, Aberdeen,
Stirling and Heriot-Watt
continue their affiliation
T h e referendum seems to
indicate the v i e w s of the
' s i l e n t majority', since a l l
the main p o l i t i c a l organizations
at the university, from Broad
Left to Federation of C o n -
servative Students, opposed
d i s a f f i l i a t i o n .
Commenting on the d e c i s i o n ,
as N U S spokesman, s a i d :
'After a little while out in the
cold, Edinburgh will come
back again'.
Further fears
F o l l o w i n g the recent
announcement of further
cut-backs in public spending,
it seems l i k e l y that the
Science R e s e a r c h C o u n c i l ' s
budget for 1980 w i l l be
reduced not by a s i x t h , as
forecast i n last w e e k ' s
Student World', but by a quarter.
T h i s makes it a l l the more
probable that university
education and research w i l l
be affected.

that it may be extended to

Astronomicler!
In the front page lead
story last w e e k ' s THES it
i s suggested that government
o f f i c i a l s i n the Department
of E d u c a t i o n a n d Science
are expecting a drop i n
numbers of university students
of around 7.000 next year as
a result of fee increases (see
fast week's FELIX). T h i s
would be the first drop since
1939, and would result in a
total of 268,000 students,
17,000 fewer than the govern-
ment target.
Informed sources at the
universities, however, do not
believe that such a drop i s

University are refusing to pay

protest at the 30% increase

Higher grants for students

Red tape & dark skins
The Guardian has exposed
a Government plan that could
seriously affect all current
and potential overseas
students |n Britain.
T h e plan i s embodied i n a
confidential Home Office a n d
D E S draft circular which
encourages c o l l e g e s a n d
universities to give evidence
i n c a s e s of v i s a renewal
applications that the overseas
student i s in fact continuing
with h i s course of studies
and, i n most c a s e s , that he
has attended them regularly'.
T h i s p o l i c i n g • p o l i c y w i l l
affect the 53,000 overseas
students i n B r i t a i n , of whom
8,500 are at L o n d o n U n i v e r s i t y ,
mostly a s postgraduates, a n d
it i s designed to 'help to
maintain an effective immig-
ration control'.
Knowledge of English
A further recommendation
i s that universities refer
overseas students' admission
applications to an Entry
C e r t i f i c a t i o n Officer, an
immigration o f f i c i a l i n their
own country, who w i l l be
authorised to examine the
student's knowledge of
E n g l i s h a n d h i s f i n a n c i a l
standing. A n d this o f f i c i a l .
w i l l be empowered to refuse
students the right to come to
B r i t a i n , even if they are
sponsored by their own
government. C o l l e g e s would
a l s o be encouraged to require
deposits from overseas
students before admitting
them. T h e s e restrictions,
say the circular, are 'in order
to prevent wasted journeys to
the UK.'
Riot
N U S , L S O and other
organizations concerned with
foreign students have already
protested to the Home Office
about the circular, a n d there
is to be a picket at D E S
next Thursday at 1.30pm.
Richard Silver, President of
U L U , described the news as
'absolutely scandalous', and
s a i d , 'We'll go to fantastic
lengths to smash this one—If
they want a riot on their
hands, the Home Office is
asking for it'.
In defence- of the circular,
Gordon Oakes M P , Minister
of State at D E S , s a i d i n a
radio interview that it 'breaks
no new ground' and that 'you
can't expect the British
taxpayer indefinitely to
support overseas students'.

Students is absolutely right
to be taking a very active
part in its affairs.'
