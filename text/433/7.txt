No headway on vinyl for US 'stars'
WILD C H E R R Y (Epic)
'Funky white folks score in the
energy stakes' Ultra-hip, s i l k y s l i c k ,
fonken — people sho' got enough white-
boy imitators, but they keep on coming
back in search of 'the real f e e l ' . T h i s
bunch get c l o s e , up in both U S and our
very own s i n g l e s scenarios with the
opener 'Play that Funky music'. Slightly
sub-commodores standard but s t i l l mighty
fine.
Some good bands have emerged from
the bad-ass fonk field, notably Brass
Construction, the aforementioned Motown
-maestros, and w a r . From this album it
sounds like Wild Cherry, even though
just a bunch' a honkies, could be
joining the higher echelons pretty soon
if they maintain their essence and energy
for longer than a couple of sides-worth.
The group are made up of Robert
P a r i s s i , twin lead quitars with Bryan
Bassett; A l l e n Wentz on bass, and the
s k i n - f l i c k i n g of Ronald B e i f l e . Although
a quartet, the action is strictly P a r i s s i -
controlled, producing the proceedings
and penning s i x of the nine available
snippets. T h e other three are by such
soul luminaries a s Wilson P i c k e t t , Steve
Cropper, and the formidable H o l l a n d -
Dozier-Holland midfield trio.
Wild Cherry and their vibes aim at the
more immediately mobile parts of the
anatomy — feet, arms, hips — with a
tailor-made beat for those who appreciate
a good sweat on the floor. It's get-up-
and-shake-the-funky-cobwebs dancing
music and just the sort of thing to
dyno-rod the circulation when you've
had a couple.
Mind y o u , the stuffing starts to get
a bit thin by the middle of the B - s i d e ,
with a shallow dooh-dah c a l l e d 'Hold on'
and the sensitively-titled 'Get it up'
which in the end turns out to be a rather
limp 'organ'-based instrumental with a
certain lack Of thrust about it. Obvious
Blakoe malfunction. N o matter — the
band boogies on out at full pelt on the
c l o s i n g track 'What in the funk do you
It's not a great musical achievement;
it wasn't intended to be, but a s far a s
vitality goes it beats the e y e b a l l s out of
boring, overpaid, old farts (Robin Trower
to name but a half) currently following
the same well-trodden, well-heeled,
paths on their supposedly ' n e w '
r e l e a s e s .
Fonk field revitalised
• j R A H A M C E N T R A L
The thing with disco-funk bands is
that really they are a live comodity. P u t
them in the sterile surrounds of a
recording studio, and no matter how hard
they try, no way are they going to get
anywhere near the feel of their stage
act. Graham Central Station are no
different. I'd probably d i g their show
anytime, but play them on an o l d tin box
in a Maida V a l e squat on a cold October
night?. N o , the only way a band like
this can do justice to themselves is on
a live stage, where thankfully presence
and atmosphere count a s much — some-
times more — than the songs being laid
down.
Try a s they d o , the Station just can't
bring the vinyl alive even though they
start with the intro to their act - the semi
instrumental 'Entraw', where they invite
the listener to ' a party'. A t first they
appear to have everything. S l i c k
professionalism? Y o u bet. Tight
musicianship? Sure as h e l l . Harmonies?
S T A T I O N - 'MIRROR'
f a u l t l e s s , but atmosphere? None.
The songs aren't a l l that memorable
(again, not a l w a y s the most important
thing in a live context), ranging from the
standard funk of 'Do Yah' (no relation
to the Move claim), the present single
'/ got a reason', with its deft reggae
slanting, sung in a 'souly falsetto'. On
the other hand you can forget the psuedo-
gospel lyricism of 'Forever'; the song has
a nice melodic synthesizer passage
running through it.
The best track is probably 'Save Me',
which opens up side T w o , and has a
particularly catchy chorus line. Although
strings and horns are used throughout,
they are always held back to allow the
rhythm section and vocal lines to be
well to the fore.
Although a big act in the States,
where their last album went Gold, in this
country they are destined one feels only
to be adored in the land of the d i s c o .
