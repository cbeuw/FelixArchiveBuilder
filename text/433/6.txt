First Prize Second Prize
by Miss Lindsay Maxwell Mech Eng PG by Miss Lindsay Maxwell
PHOTSOC COMPETITION RESULTS
These are the winning photos from Photsoc's first competition
of the year, held on Tuesday 26th October. The chosen best two
overall were both by Miss Lindsay Maxwell, who gets our whole-
hearted congratulations but in fairness to the rest of us who
entered the competition, it was pretty damn close. The general
standard of photography was high. Foul play was not suspected.
Jorge Saffar's entry, which won the prize for new members,
was also in the running for one of the top spots.
The club runs two fully equipped darkrooms plus a weekly
competition, instruction group, forum, lecture on whatever takes
our fancy. This Wednesday (10th) we're going to visit the
Kodak factory, but that's fully booked up, so you can't go.
However on Tuesday 16th we are holding a portrait session with
a model and a guest photographer. The latter will demonstrate
lighting and other studio techniques, so anyone interested in
joining us should come along that night (with a camera of
course) to the Union Concert Hall at 7pm.
For more information about Photsoc call John Mattheus
(int. 2786) or Deji Demuren (int. 2890).
