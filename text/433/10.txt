Gutteridge win
Seeking again to do w e l l
in the Gutteridge C u p (which
was so c l o s e to being brought
to I C last season), the 1st
ventured into the depth of
Hertfordshire to play the side
they knocked out 4—3 last
s e a s o n .
After a promising start,
Cotter k i c k e d a penalty to
give I C a 3 point lead. T h i s
was soon followed by a fine
try by West w h i c h resulted
from a previously untried
movement from our b a c k s .
A s u c c e s s f u l penalty attempt
by ' V e t s s a w the half-timer
score to 7—3.
With the forwards winning
only a limited amount of
b a l l , the backs began to
show some flair. After a
clean p a s s i n g movement
Williams scored a n excellent
try on the right w i n g . T a k i n g
on 2 men he k i c k e d ahead,
ran through (a mass of
opponents) and gathering
the b a l l , went over for a
try. Shortly afterwards a
c r a s h movement by Gilbert
led to a Cotter try, converted
to give I C a 1 7 - 3 l e a d .
In the last 10 minutes,
Vets turned on the pressure
and were rewarded with a
consolation try. Another
Cotter penalty s a w the final
score at 20—7, a good result
from an entertaining match.
There is s t i l l room for
improvement, but the side
shows great promise.

Middleton's defeat
IC 1 St J o h n s , Cambridge 3
Having arrived at Cambridge
with eleven players I C con-
fronted St Johns w i t h the
infamous 'Middleton S y s t e m ' .
T h i s c o n s i s t s of three forwards,
four h a l v e s , three b a c k s and a
goalkeeper. T h e idea being to
prevent the opposition scoring.
However, Saturday proved
how even the best theories are
prone to failure. T h e match
started with St Johns finding
gaps i n an I C defence, which
seemed totally disinterested

I C L a d i e s showed their
ability o n Saturday by gaining
the Club's* first' point" i n the
Southern L e a g u e . T h i s came
as somewhat of a surprise,
since the C l u b were expecting
a convincing defeat by a far
better Portsmouth s i d e . Maria
Georgiadis deserves s p e c i a l
mention for bowling a mag-
nificent 384.
Portsmouth fielded a far
superior team w h i c h upset
the standard of our l j t s , who,
were bowling very sub-standard.
T h e 2 mis tried hard with Martin
L y n n rolling Imperials highest
3core of the day at 484.
The previous week Imperial
had a n enjoyable Sunday at
Southampton at w h i c h P a u l
Bartzett broke the 200 barrier
and set the C l u b off to a
f l y i n g start. Despite this w e
were narrowly beaten a n d had

return. Rupert W i l l o x - B a k e r , our
driver, found a very good pub
and negotiated the entrance
better than the exit.

in the game. St Johns were
q u i c k l y two goals up. Down the
other end of the p i t c h I C
forwards mystified everyone
by their ability to s e t up
chances and then miss them.
The chief culprit was Middleton
who spent most of h i s time
alternating between cursing the
the defence and making
apologies to them a s the ball
went between h i s l e g s .
Although the defence woke
up after the interval, and
began to play hockey, they
became disheartened by the
continued inability of the I C
forwards to s c o r e . I C then
went three goals down.
In the last few minutes of
the game (due to the Umpire's
generosity) IC scored a goal,
w h i c h was contested even by
their own (IC's) defence. T h e
The fact that Middjeton had
scored w a s first to much for
them.

Sports editing
Dear S i r , — A s the author
of the article entitles 'Mud-
free' which appeared i n last
w e e k ' s F E L I X , I w i s h to
point out that the published
item bore little resemblence
to the one originally submitted
for publication. T h e original
contained descriptions of two
events in w h i c h die C r o s s -
country C l u b h a d participated
the previous w e e k . T h e
featured article c o n s i s t e d of
a report o n just one of
these events (the description
of the other event w a s o f
equal length i n the original,)
and that w a s i n an edited
v e r s i o n .
I have it on good authority
that some of the other sports
articles printed were a l s o
subjected to this form of
guillotine editing, and i n one
case i n particular a report,,
submitted w a s not published
whilst the soccer c l u b had
two articles on the sports
page!)
T h i ' i devastating use of
the editorial Derogative makes
absolute nonsense of the
p o l i c y of ~ a s k i n g people to
write reports for F E L I X .
The editor, Mr Dewey, must
have a deep contempt for I C
sportmen and their literary
a b i l i t i e s , since the drastic
action he takes regarding
a r t i c l e s , i s i n order to
confine sport to one page in
F E L I X .
Sport should have a s
many pages in F E L I X , a s
is necessary i n ordg:r .to
publish a l l the submitted
reports. T h i s could be done
without increasing the s i z e
of the paper, by removing several
of the regular features i n
F E L I X . B y this I am refering
to the 'What's on' pages and
the reviews pages, the latter
being a pointless contribution
to F E L I X by self-styled
c r i t i c s whose pretentious
journalism is a s justified
as any c l a i m I would make
to be an Olympic athlete.
R e v i e w s by better qualified
people c a n be found elsewhere,
so why have them i n F E L K ?
T h u s , by the removal of
the pages occupied by these
space consuming topics,
room would be created for
a l l articles i n a virtually
unedited form.
Yours in the hope that this
letter i s printed i n an
unedited form.
