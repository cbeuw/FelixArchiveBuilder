So You Think You're Bored
Hearing About Elections!
You think you're bored hearing about
elections! I'm the mug that has to carry
out the job of Returning Officer for a l l
elections that w . i l occur sporadically
throughout this year.
Well w e ' v e plugged up a few more
holes — notably the election for two
members of the Permanent Working party
(PWP) and one ordinary member of the
Union Finance Committee ( U F C ) — and
we've elected the delegation to bring
you back some Blackpool Rock from the
NUS National Conference in December. T o
give you some idea of the current state
of play here are some election results:-
2 members of PWP:
Mr Steve Paterson (Squaddy)
Mr Duncan Suss
1 member of U F C ;
Mr Dave N i c k s o n
NUS Delegation:
Delegates: Mr N i c k Brayshaw
Mr Hugh Barrett
Mr John White
Mr R i c k Parker
Mr John Morgan
Observers: M i s s Mary Attenborough
Mr Paul Ekpenyong
Mr Adrian Sudworth
Other elections ratified include:
Welfare Officer — John Morgan
Carnival Coordinator — Martin Judkins
Mech Eng Dep Rep — Thach Pham.

p of the Union
At the last U G M , Thursday 28th
October, I brought a paper w h i c h , on your
acceptance, changed the terms and the
fees of L i f e Membership of the Union.
Things are now tighter, we hope, and we
feel that no one w i l l now be in a position
whereby the Union cannot decide whether
they are e l i g i b l e for Life Membership of
the Union or not — this has occurred in
the past under the previous terms.
The new terms and fees are a s
fol lows:
You are eligible to become a Lite
Member of the Imperial College Union lf:-
(a) You have been a member ot the
Union for at least one academic year.
(b) You have been research assistant
and a member of the senior common room
for at least one academic year.
(c) You are a member of the academic
staff.
(d) You are a member of the admini-
strative staff, and are qualified to degree
status (such an application to be subject
to the approval of the Union Council).
F e e s
For section (a)
(i) The subscription is £8.00
(previously £6.00) for ex-students at any
time after the completion of at least
three complete sessions.
(ii) For those who do not complete
three sessions the subscription is £12.00
(previously £10.00).
For sections (b), (c) and (d)
The subscription is £18.00 (on the
equivalent terms of elegibility, pre-
viously £15.00).
These new terms and fees will come
into effect on the first day of the Spring
Term (Monday January 10th). So why not...
ask your Mum to buy you Life Membership
of the Union for Christmas - while i t ' s
s t i l l at the old rate!
T o help you decide, here's what you
get:
(1) U s e of a l l Union F a c i l i t i e s ,
including joining any club or s o c i e t y .
(2) U s e of Sports Centre, including the
squash courts.
(3) U s e of C o l l e g e L i b r a r i e s , Refectories
and B a r s .
A l l that, a l l life long!
T i l l .anon, farewell and safe home.
Have a nice weekend!
