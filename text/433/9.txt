St Helier ' B ' 5 , v 7 Imperial College
After playing St Helier i n
a friendly last week, Imperial
C o l l e g e again headed down to
Mitcham to play them i n a
flags match (the ' F l a g s ' i s a
knockout competition). A s
usual I C were two players short
and since they had been told
that (this week) St Helier
would have a full team, I C
were expecting a hard match.
In fact St Helier only had a
one man advantage, but they
had a heavier team than the
week before. St Helier are
noted for being a ' p h y s i c a l '
team a n d this match was no
exception. T h e I C defence
q u i c k l y learnt the act of the
'take o u t ' which involves
making sure that when someone
runs into y o u it h u r t s them
them more than it does y o u .
Meanwhile I C ' s attack were
having troubles of their o w n ,
namely that St H e l i e r had a
heavy defence so I C were
coming from fifteen to twenty
yards out a n d were e a s i l y
snapped up by the goalkeeper.
F o r most o f the first half
St Helier had the upper hand.
I C ' s attack were having little
Orienteering

s u c c e s s . A t half time St H e l i e r
lead 4 - 2 .
Over the interval I C tried
to regain some composures A t
the start of the third quarter I C
somehow came into the a s c e n d - j
ancy. It wasn't s o much a c a s e
of scoring lots o f goals, but
more a c a s e of keeping
p o s s e s s i o n and just plugging
away at goal. T h e defence
really tightened up so that at
the end of the third quarter I C
lead by 5—4,
The last quarter started with
IC scoring t w o more g o a l s .
They then decided to employ
the rather dangerous p o l i c y
of just keeping p o s s e s s i o n
and not really going to hard
for goal. T h i s resulted i n a
very active last ten minutes a s
the light faded and St Helier
repeatedly attempted to make
up the three goal difference, I C
managed to hold them off and
ended a very c l o s e game, the
victors by 7—8,
Team: Bill Jackson (Capt),
Pete Watson, Bob Strangeway,
Rob Morrisson, Richard Forster,
Tony Hallett, Tony Armstrong,
Martin Trewhella.
At Camberley last Sunday,
the Orienteering C l u b took part
in the Southern Navigators
Event on B a r o s s a Common, T h i s
is an area of Army land,
c r i s s - c r o s s e d by tank tracks,
and the haxards included rolls
of barbed wire and slit trenches.
The event o f f i c i a l s were
mainly Army personnel, w h i c h
meant that the event had one
or two oddities.
The c a r park w a s some way
into the common, along a very
bumpy track, w h i c h shook up
the occupants of the minibus
slightly — perhaps Martin
K e s s l e r thought he w a s driving
a landrover. On the 11 kilometre
' A ' course, the only I C runner
was David R o s e n , w h o
despite a n Army 'funny',
completed the course i n 70
minutes 52 sees. T h e 'funny'
was that there was a n incorrect
control code — the number o n
the side of the marker which
tells y o u that you are at the
right control, C o n s e q y e n t l y , he
spent a couple of minutes
scouring the area, before
d e c i d i n g that he had been i n
the right place to begin with.
H i s time w a s nevertheless
fast enough to make h i m the
clear winner of the South E a s t
area league for 1976, despite
the fact that there i s one more
league race to go.
There were five I C runners
on the ' B ' course for men under
21, Andy Q u i c k f a l l , the newly
elected. C l u b Secretary, sped
round i n 66 minutes 16 sees,
to put him i n 2nd p l a c e , Ian
A l v e y w a s next best i n 80—36,
w h i l s t Mark E v a n s got round i n
8 9 - 5 0 ,
Several newcomers to the
sport came along and w i s e l y
tried the shorter c o u r s e s ,
N i g e l Ward d i d the 5 kilometre
course i n 68—25, w h i l s t on the
4 kilometre course, Mike
Turner took 59—25, Lennart
K a r l s s o n took 82—23, and the
new C l u b Treasurer, Roland
Thomas strolled round i n a
leisurely 111 minutes.
Next Sunday, the 7 t h of
November, the C l u b i s going
to the N e w Forest i n Hampshire
for the November C l a s s i c
Badge Event, w h i l s t the
following Sunday, w e w i l l be
going to F a r l e y Heath i n
Surrey for another ' B a d g e
E v e n t ' , We w i l l be taking a
minibus to both o f these and
newcomers are very welcome.
Just come along to our F r i d a y
lunchtime meetings at 12.40pm
in the Union S C R (on the l s t
floor), and s i g n the transport
