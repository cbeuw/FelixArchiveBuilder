Damned Bullshit!!
IAN MORSE
That w e l l known musical bog roll 'Sounds' has done it
again. Splashed across i t s front page this week are a bunch
of l i k e l y looking lads that go by the name of the Damned. Some
of you may not even of heard of the band that adorn the
coverted front page spread, once reserved only for the R o d /
E l t o n / M i c k syndrome. T h e immediate caption reads: 'Damned
Head For The Charts- Pistols Hit The Road - Punk is on its
way!'
Y e s , you've guessed it, Sounds has yet again taken upon
itself to ram punk rock down the throat of the unsuspecting
p u b l i c . Now don't get me wrong, I'll sniff glue w i t h the next
degenerate, and there's no one I'd rather see i n London today,
than a good punk rock band go through i t s p a c e s , but for a
music paper to come out with such f a l l a c i e s i s just not o n .
L e t s take a c l o s e r look at the headline 'Damned Head For
The Charts'. Right, the Damned, I caught their a c t at the R e d
C o w a week or s o ago. It w a s their first L o n d o n g i g . T h e
crowd who turned up came I would think, a s much out of
curiosity as anything, a l s o perhaps encouraged by the fab
review given to the group by a Sounds c r i t i c at a g i g i n Bedford
the previous week. I, as w e l l as 95% of the audience that
night, w i l l tell y o u boy, were they shit. T h e barrage of sound
that eminated from on stage was greeted not even by what one
could c a l l polite applause by the attendence, the majority o f
w h i c h were a l l s e a s o n e d punksters. 'Head for the Charts'?
C l o s e scrutiny of the paragraph given to the band o n page two
reveals that i n fact, the Damned's first single for the obscure
Stiff l a b e l h a s s o l d 4,000 copies (so they s a y ) . When y o u
consider that on average a single has to s e l l around 25,000
before it even reaches the T o p T h i r t y , the Sounds headline
becomes a bad j o k e .
So what exactly are the Sounds editorial board up too?
Have they a l l gone overboard at their newly discovered music
form? In fact, punk-rock as it i s today dates back to 66/67
p s y c h a d e l i a when the punks were a b a c k l a s h against the
hippie culture; the sort of k i d s who'd rather give y o u a kick
in the groin than a flower, #r maybe i t s just that this m u s i c
paper has trouble f i l l i n g s p a c e .
A n y w a y , you c a n be the best judge by going along and
listening to them y o u r s e l v e s . Among the g i g l i s t i n g s there are
sprinkled a few that feature punk bands; Vibrators, Subway
Sect, Clash, Jam, Rockets anu the very wonderful Stranglers.
