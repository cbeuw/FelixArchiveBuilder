I C W A
H e l l o again, I'm sorry to keep battling
on about elections but there appears to
be some confusion a s regards ' M r I C W A ' .
Nomination papers are now posted and
include the position of ' M r I C W A ' . H e
too, however, must be proposed and
seconded by members of ICWA. S o to
those candidates who have been proposed
by men (!) please would y o u a s k a
member of ICWA to sign your nomination
paper instead. Don't forget the papers
come down next Friday and the general
meeting w i l l be on Monday November 5th.
ICWA has now had its first d i s c o and
despite the fact that the entertainers
didn't know how to put a plug o n their
deck the evening seemed to be quite
s u c c e s s f u l . Many thanks to Madeleine
who helped clear the refectory and
' J Smith of C C D ' who helped put the
refectory back. (I! — E d ) .

External Affairs
With the e l e c t i o n of NUS delegates
over, the next step is to prioritise the
motions and submit amendments. T h i s
w i l l be done at a n open External
Affairs Meeting on T u e s d a y 9 t h November
at 6.30pm in the Union Lower Refectory.
Since it i s an open meeting everyone
present w i l l be able to vote, s o if you
are interested please come along.
A n 88-page document listing a l l the
motions has arrived in the union office
and is available if you wish to consult
it. Motions range from N U S s e r v i c e s to
Southern A f r i c a and the Environment. If
you wish to submit an amendment to
one of these, please let me have it,
preferably in writing, before Tuesday.
A s you are reading this I shall be
on my w a y to an NUS Services C o n -
ference at Cheltenham where NUS w i l l
try to e x p l a i n how Travel lost in the
region of £30,000 last year, and how they
hope to restore it to a break even
situation.
A date for your diary i s the 17th
November when NUS are organising a
National Demo on Grants and C u t s ,
starting from Hyde Park Corner. I C U
w i l l be sending along a delegation,
and since i t ' s on a Wednesday afternoon
we should have quite a good turnout.
One final plea — the External
Affairs Committee is s t i l l without a
Secretary, Services L i a s o n Officer,
P R O and P u b l i c i t y officer. If anyone
is interested in doing any of these
worthwhile ( s i c ) jobs please let me
know.

External Affairs Officer
