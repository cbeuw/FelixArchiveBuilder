8 COLUMNS 21 November 1997
There is a whole area of
policies and institutions
which, were they never
there in the first place,
could never possibly be introduced
due to the political consequences.
Examples would be the House of
Lords, a Bill allowing hunting with
dogs, or the legalising of nicotine to
smoke. But the example that may
be of more relevance to us is the
anomaly of the Oxbridge tuition
fees.
The Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge receive an extra £2000
per student in Government subsidy
for their tuition. Others such as
Exeter and Durham receive a small
extra subsidy, since they are colle-
giate, but the amount pales into
insignificance compared with the
Oxbridge windfall. This is an anath-
ema to the left-wing view, that
those with immense privilege and
glittering future prospects are given
taxpayers' money to enhance their
own education beyond what others
in higher education receive.
Perhaps students at Imperial, who
no doubt have almost as glittering
career prospects to look forward
to, should lobby for some
Government cash?
Oxbridge has a rather interest-
ing set of excuses for their gener-
ous agreement - the usual chain of
events that occur when some
august institution finds its happily
arranged state of affairs under
attack (the other one in the news
recently is the Royal Opera House).
Their first line of defence was that
the excellence of the universities
would be under attack, with words
such as "mutilated" and destroyed"
being used to refer to the inevitable
consequences. Oxbridge students
have also not been slow off the
mark in seeing their system threat-
ened. "It seems likely that it's the
motivates him or her, results in a
better performance in their studies.
The Cherwell (their equivalent to
Felix) says in grave tones that "the
sheer expense of maintaining a sys-
tem where students receive one to
one tuition from tutors will render
the arrangement impossible to sus-
tain, and Oxbridge will have to turn
to the system of lecture and semi-
nar based degree courses practised

student who will end up footing the
bill - although even if students do
come up with the cash, it may not
be enough". Their Vice-Chancellor
chipped in: "We believe the two
collegiate universities to be nation-
al assets that need national support
in order to maintain their achieve-
ments at the forefront of world
class teaching and research."
What they are defending, in
reality, is their college and tutorial
system. Students are taught in
groups of two or three, which
allows a much more personal style
of teaching. The concentrated
effort on each student, coupled
with the constant watchful eye that

by other universities." Most of us
would happily welcome them into
the real world, except their version
of the facts hardly sustain credibili-
ty. The £35 million extra they
receive from the public comprises a
minute proportion of the total bud-
get at the universities. Complaints
from smaller colleges they could be
left destitute or bankrupt merit little
sympathy either: larger colleges are
known to take the lion's share of the
extra subsidy, and are easily
wealthy enough to subsidise the
poorer ones - Trinity College
Cambridge (total value; £300 mil-
lion) already assists smaller col-
leges. It would not be beyond the
ingenuity of Oxbridge to fill the gap
with other forms of funding. The
existence of world-class research
and teaching at a number of other
institutions, notably our own, fur-
ther undermines the strength of
their argument.
There was increasing bitterness
in Oxford last week at the com-
ments of an ex-bursar and the
College Warden, Sir Christopher
Ball, who said that taking money
from the Government was like "tak-
ing candy from a baby". He said
that Oxbridge needed to be more
honest in its dealings with the
Government. Reaction was swift
and a little distasteful: "These were
unpleasant allegations from a
biased source, it was not an even-
sided viewpoint. ... I don't think
that, from the point of view of
Oxford and Cambridge, this is a
very helpful story." In that last com-
ment, at least, the don in question
is right. Baroness Blackstone has
not withheld her intention to "cor-
rect" the anomaly, and their are few
Oxbridge alumni in the Cabinet -
with one major exception - Tony
Blair. An Old Boy Network is little
use without the old boys.
Chancellors from other Universities
have been coming out of the
woodwork suggesting other uses
for the money. It seems another
"untouchable shrine" of tenuously-
justified public expenditure is com-
ing to an end.
