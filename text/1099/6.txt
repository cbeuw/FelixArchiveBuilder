iWE The Imperial College
School of Medicine was
founded on the first of August
1997. The election of a new presi-
dent should be a time for putting
past grievances aside and allowing
this latest addition to Imperial
College to have a chance to proove
that it can work alongside the rest
of the CCU's.
Finally, am I just being suspi-
cious to question the fact that one
of the presidential candidates in
this election has credit as "Right
Hand Man" to Felix?
Yours
Nick Newton, ICSM
I am very pleased to hear that,
regardless of how you voted, you
took the time to talk to the can-
didates in person - if only every-
one cared enough to do so. You
certainly cannot be accused of
the mindless block voting I was
complaining about last week.
This is indeed a time to "put past
grievances aside" and cooperate;
exactly why the lack of free voting
was such a disaster.
I am however, extremely
offended by your accusations
that I threw my support behind
one candidate. This is simply
untrue, and I challenge anyone to
find the slightest bias in Felix's
election reporting. The reason
that Mark Baker appears in the
credits of Felix is that he con-
tributes a vast amount of time
and effort to the paper, as he has
done for several years. Ed
OPERA LAST
Dear Jeremy,
Due to an enormous cock-up
by the Union officials, especially
the late lamented president, OpSoc
have been forced to move the
dates of their show back a month.
We were given a promise to have
the Concert Hall for the first week
of February by Eric Allsop last term,
before we booked rights and fixed
ourselves up with a director, an M D
and pianist. However, a member
of our committee happened to be
in the Union Office, and happened
to hear that actually, despite every-
thing we'd been told, the Concert
Hall was to go the Charing Cross
and Westminster Operatic Society,
during the same week as ourselves,
even though they shouldn't have
been able to make a definite book-
ing this far in advance. Obviously
we weren't particularly impressed.
OK, I admit, the extra month might
help by making the show even bet-
ter, but if one society can be
pushed aside for another like this,
what's to stop others being equally
badly treated? You might think I'm
making a great fuss about nothing,
but this is serious. If we had been
told that we couldn't change the
rights, we'd have had to cancel the
show completely, make new
arrangements and lose masses of
money and time, and then possibly
not have been able to put on a
show at all. This has been narrow-
ly averted, fortunately. This comes
as an unfortunate reminder not to
trust anyone's word, and to get
everything in writing. I'd like to
add that I've nothing against any
other Operatic Societies, that I
wish them nothing but success, as I
know from bitter experience how
difficult it is to get anyone at this
extremely artistic place to come
and watch anything that isn't a
computer screen.
Yours sincerely,
Julia Harries, Chem 2
DON'T LOSE YOUR
RAG
Dear Jeremy,
I felt moved to write to Felix after
reading the issue of Friday 14th, con-
cerning the glaring inaccuracies con-
tained in the "Rag Mag Beyond A
Joke" article. 1 would like to know
why, if Felix is supposed to be impar-
tial, no-one on the RAG committee
was contacted to give our side of the
story: if someone had spoken to us,
then maybe the facts could have
been printed in the story.
So, to the errors. Firstly, we
were only asked to delete two
jokes (not three), which we duly
did, before any copies were sold.
Secondly, I would like to know
about the "collection planned for
tuesday morning". In my position
as secretary, I deal with organising
licenses for such collections, and
unless 1 am suddenly suffering from
amnesia, our next collection is at
the Wimbledon vs Man Utd match
on Saturday, where we were never
intending to sell RAG Mags.
1 would also be interested to
know who "voiced concerns" that
the 'Mag' would not make any
money. The production cost was
43p per copy, and with a cover
price of "60p minimum" (and a sub-
stantial number of people who are
prepared to pay a pound), by my
arithmetic if we sell a comparable
number to last year, we should
make a reasonable profit (that is, if
we are allowed to...). Contrary to
your claim, advertising WAS
sought, and it was unfortunate that
no-one responded in time, despite
interest being shown. If you look at
the ICU RAG Mags from the previ-
ous decade (and even further
back), you might notice that they
do not contain any advertising.
People tend to (rightly) feel cheat-
ed when they buy a RAG Mag
which is half full of adverts.
As for our new president's com-
ments, would it not have been fair-
er for him to speak to us first, and
to leave spouting any soundbites
that he had on the matter until after
our meeting at the Union Exec,
when we will have had a chance to
give our side of the story? I would
also be interested to know if he has
seen the RCS RAG Mag, which has
far more potential to be offensive
in content than our effort. Has he
also seen any previous ICU RAG
Mags? 1 suspect not, because, to
the best of my knowledge, this
year's is far less offensive than any-
thing that has gone before it.
Finally, on a lighter note, I'd like
to take this opportunity to thank
the RCSU for organising and run-
ning a fantastic Beer Festival: cer-
tainly the best since I've been here.
Yours,
Paul Cole, Mech Eng 3,
1CU RAG Secretary 1997-8.
PS: Call me sad if you want, but I
have counted the jokes in the RAG
Mag: There are 3 "Gay" Jokes, and 3
"Racist" Jokes, including one of
each which was censored. On the
other hand, there are 1 1 "blonde"
jokes, numerous "1C MenAVomen"
Jokes, etc, so we think that if we
have been offensive, at least we
have been universally offensive.
A joke is a joke, and if you took
them too seriously, then you would
either have to be pretty stupid, or
have bigoted opinions anyway.
After all, most people don't think
that all blonde women are REALLY
slags, do they? I would also like to
point out that the ICU RAG com-
mittee which approved this RAG
Mag is Multiracial.
1. The reason why we report-
ed that three jokes were to be
deleted is that, at the time of
writing, three jokes were to be
deleted.
2. The reason why we report-
ed that you had a London collec-
tion is that the RAG chair gave us
a timetable that clearly states
"November 15th - London
Collection".
3. 60p over a cost of 43p is
not a good margin (the RCSU
managed to produce a much
thicker effort for less than 30p).
Anybody who feels cheated if a
mag they bought for charity con-
tains adverts is clearly a cretin.
4.1 have read the entire RCSU rag
mag and found it much more
amusing and (therefore?) less
offensive than your own.
5. A joke is not, necessarily a
joke. Of course people don't real-
ly think that blondes are slags,
but there are plenty of people out
there who think that black people
and gays are stupid, inferior or
worthy only of derision and
destruction. "Jokes" such as the
ones censored from your mag,
only serve to prolong and perhaps
to incite such bigotry.
You write of such "jokes" "if
you took them too seriously ...
then you would have to be pretty
stupid." What makes you a better
judge that the ICU president,
deputy president, manager, print
manager and printer, who all took
the matter very seriously? You
certainly make it very tempting to
suggest that the one who has
"bigoted opinions anyway" is
none other than yourself. Ed
TIMEWARP
Dear Felix
I was sitting in the JCR today
flicking through Felix when my
attention was diverted by one of
those messageboards that you see
made from little flashy red lights,
just by the canteen. 11 told me that
the time was 16:36 though it had
quite blatantly just gone three and
then continued by informing me
that the ICU cinema will reopen
soon showing "The Adam's Family
Values" and "Shindler's List" in -
get this - May 1994. Why is it
there? Why? Is it some in-joke that
no-one has explained to me? Or
was it really set up in 1994 and
hasn't been changes since? Can
someone explain?
Then I glanced down at the
back page of Felix to see a 'recent'
photo of IC Shooting Club, one of
whom, a friend of mine, 1 know for
a fact to be living in Grenoble at the
moment on a year out. The photo
must be at least a year old.
Feel like I am living in a time
warp. Perhaps I am.

When I saw it, it was advertising
the ICU carnival with the Whirl y-
gig room. Made me feel quite
nostalgic. Ed
