hree Viewings, three people,
three stories - so simple, so
deliberate and yet somehow
Jeffery Hatcher's new drama/come-
dy smacks of something so real and
ordinary it's a pleasure to watch. It
takes place in a funeral parlour
where people have come to view
and pay their last respects to vari-
ous deceased - a bizarre situation
we are not familiar with in this coun-
try. Yet these three stories, each
about different lives, people and
themes are not brought together by
the morbid element present in each,
but by the different way they each
portray the idea of love in it's most
pleasurable, horrible and amusing
forms.
The first tale we hear is that of
Emil, the funeral director played by
Robert Jeez, who is going through
the agonies of unrequited love as he
watches the object of his 'silent'
desire use the viewing to build up
her contacts for her real-estate busi-
ness. The feelings, that I am sure we
have all experienced, are displayed
with such honesty and honour that
we laugh with, not at, the somewhat
sad figure.
This is followed by the story of
Mac (Karen Ascot) who tried to for-
get her troubled past by carving her-
self a lucrative career - corpse rob-
bing. We are taken by her brash,
confident personality through the
wickedly amusing episode of trying
to rob her now deceased grand-
mother. It's not long, however,
before the tough outgoing exterior is
broken by the reality of her life. It's
a shocking and moving tale.
Finally we meet the recently wid-
owed Virginia, played by Ann
Penfold, who has inherited unpaid
and unpayable debts. As the tale
winds itself slowly into a knot, leav-
ing the overwhelmed widow
trapped and helpless, a cunning
twist of fate provides an ingenious
answer.
Each story is wonderfully written
twisting to some unexpected cli-
max, and each grippingly told,
pulling the audience through a range
of raw emotions. The intimate the-
atre and stage put the truth and
reality of the situation directly in the
face of the audience and when one
of the actresses reduces herself to
tears you are truly able to believe
her sad plight.
With no entrances or exits, no
flashy lighting changes and minimal
staging and movement, it's hard to
say whether this play might appeal
to the majority of people. (In a the-
atre that could possible seat 100
people I somehow don't think that
this is the intention.) The acting is
superb (the credentials in the pro-
gram are enough to tell you this)
and their use of the audience and
script delightful.
It is an evening of looking at
death in a light we are not quite
used to, being drawn through a
depth of emotions, and walking out
with a smile on you face. Strange,
but true.
