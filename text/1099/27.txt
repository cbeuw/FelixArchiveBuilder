Life's a pitch for footballers
ICAFC I v UMDS I
UMDS, widely regarded as
favourites for relegation from ULU
Premier League, totally outfought
Imperial, widely regarded as
favourites to win the League, in the
1 st half. Even the IC Fourths would
have been disappointed with such
a performance. Injuries to key play-
ers meant that Chris Tannizeris
made his first team debut while
Jules Porreca made a comeback at
right-back. The latter struggled and
was at fault for UMDS' opener 15
minutes into the first half. Things
did not improve after that and
Steve Fleming dropped back into
defence as the Firsts switched to
their customary 3-5-2 formation in
a bid to get back into the game.
UMDS got another after a terrible
mix-up between Donal Keane (yet
to recapture his glorious form of
last season) and German Shanidze.
A half-time talk by captain Psycho
worked miracles as Imperial pulled
one back straight after the restart
after a UMDS defender headed a
Richard Pratt cross into his own
goal. What followed was massive
IC pressure; Amo hit the post and
had an amazing bicycle kick which
just went over the bar, while top
scorer Alex Marcos managed not
top score on more than one occa-
sion. In the end UMDS managed to
hold on to their lead. How could
this happen? As with World War II
we must make sure that this never
happens again. That's rubbish. We
are at war with every College in
London and, of course, Germany.
One battle may have been lost, but
have no doubt, we will win the war.
ICAFC 11-2 UMDS I
ICAFC III v LSE II
The thirds continued a great BUSA
run by annihilating an LSE side from
the division above us. It was a solid
first half performance and IC went
ahead . Andy made a dubious tack-
le on the LSE keeper to leave a
simple tap in for Lee. The second
goal saw Lee scorching down the
left touchline, cutting inside and
shooting it past the bewildered
keeper. IC continued with a solid
performance, especially in defence
with Jamie, Andy Binstead and
Miles looking firm!
The second half saw two fur-
ther goals from IC. Andy Bellis
curled one in from the left-hand
side of the penalty box and Andy
Murphy finished off a great break
from Simon to leave 1C with a com-
fortable lead. Despite a late penal-
ty to spoil Ricky's clean sheet, it
was another spell binding perfor-
mance from the thirds. Who can
stop us now? Who are Man Utd
anyway?

ICAFC II v LSE II
Since the injury to Captain Dan
Waight sidelined him for most of
the remainder of the season, this
match was "for Dan", in the words
of stand-in captain Loz. We did the
Dan warm-up and then we went
out and did him proud.
The match was an even con-
test in midfield and up front. Only
in defence could the teams be
separated. Luckily this was due to
the fact that LSE were pants and
Loz, Fresher Phil and Phil The Pill
were rock solid for IC. The first
goal was scored by Si after a
scrambled clearance from LSE. The
next came from a long ball over the
defence beautifully put away by an
LSE donkey, rattled by the pres-
ence of The Boy Martin and Pistol
Pete. The next was another long
ball but this time Pete saved the
defence the trouble of scoring,
walking around the keeper and
slotting it home.
Three-nil up at half-time and
the game was won so we went to
sleep. Chris "Scouse" Barlow did
us proud in goal but couldn't keep
a clean sheet. Still, we had won the
match for Dan and that was what
mattered. The seconds are indebt-
ed to Dan for whipping us into
shape with strict discipline and
great leadership. Get well soon.
ICAFC II 3 - 1 LSE II
ICAFC V v RSM II
Last Saturday brought together
two teams who's derby history
rivals that of Manchester and
Liverpool.There is never more than
one goal between these teams and
so it proved in this second round
cup tie. IC V took the lead after
twenty minutes when Pokki, our
new thai signing, played an expert
pass behind the defence for Andy
to finish with a low shot in the bot-
tom corner. The rest of the half
was very scrappy with lots of chal-
lenges thrown in from all angles
until RSM II equalised through
their captain's chip. The second
half was one way traffic with IC V
retaining the ball throughout but
there seemed to be no way past
RSM's goalkeeper. The frustration
grew deeper until Nick ran forty
yards with the ball and slipped it
through for Andy to score his sec-
ond. The third came soon after
when supersub Darren was left
with a simple goal following some
good passing. Minutes later RSM II
prolonged the tension after some
rubbish defending attributable to
an anonymous player. The draw
for the next round is at home to
Holloway at the start of next term.
Let us hope for yet more glory for
IC and the defecation of RSM into
the proverbial toilet bowl.
RSM II 2 -3 ICAFC V
Try, try and try again for rugby team
ICURFC I v
BLACKHEATH
One very hazy Saturday 18 sex
gods and 1 sex goddess turned up
to partake of the gentlemans sport
of Rugby Union Football aganist the
oldest club in the land. These 19
deities reached a nirvana of gor-
geousness. Were it not that the ref-
eree was clearly not a decent
English gentleman we would surely
have triumphed over the dastardly
enemy, however the referee had
succumbed to the sin of greed and
his inadequacies with respect to
the beautiful game were atrocious.
Mr.C. "Pile-Driver" Cunnel was
quick to liberate our first reward for
our dextrous endeavours.
However, as the gentlemen fell
victim to the sin of complacency,
the opposition surged back to a
position from which they could not
be usurped. With the gentlemen
taking particular offense to the
actions of the opposition, confla-
grations of the kind involving
fisticuffs made a sad appearance in
the final quarter of the match.
In retrospect, a fine perfor-
mance from all the gentlemen con-
cerned, particularly Mr Cunnel,
along with excellent captaining
from Mr R.Gare contributed to a
result of which the whole college
can be justifiably proud.
Veni vedi vici.

ICURFC \\I\W v
School of law
A team of 23 took on and beat the
lanky lawyers from UCL. Despite
their inside backs being faster than
Logic(al), the lawyers could not
compete with our sheer wieght of
numbers. Crushed by the obesity of
Gutmund and kicked around by
Peachy and Nipply the lawyers
defence in the second half was
leaky with many objections (your
honour!) and penalties. However,
IC surged into the lead with kicks
from full back Chris Dickinson and a
try from Dave best.
If these boys were on a 'no win,
no fee' contract they'd be sober
but IC go on to the next match,
knowing that the jury is still out on
their greatness.
