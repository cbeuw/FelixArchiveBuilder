On Sunday the first round London
qualifiers of the National Under 25
Pairs bridge tournament took place
at the Young Chelsea Bridge Club,
Earls Court.
Imperial College was well rep-
resented with 6 pairs of current
students and a pair of old boys.
There were 1 7 pairs in all each
playing 36 boards of which the top
third qualified for the next round of
the competition. Of our pairs only
one qualified, Dom 'Bat' Goodwin
and Jon 'Heff Todd, but all the
pairs acquitted themselves well
and all enjoyed the afternoon. The
positions and scores for our pairs
were:
2. Dom 'Bat' Goodwin + Jon 'Heff'
Todd (61.3%)
9. Giles 'Squirrel' Cope + Daniel

National
honours
for bowler
Congratulations to Rich Norris on
his third consecutive selection for
the BUSA Tenpin Bowling Team.
The team selection took place at
the BUSA National Championships
at Nottingham on Sunday 16th
November, which was attended by
15 members of the ICU Tenpin
Bowling Club.
Performances particularly wor-
thy of note came from Ade Martins
and Chi Yung Ng, who both bowled
their highest series ever. Chi also
bowled his first ever 200+ game.
And then he did it again! All teams
bowled impressively, with a very
high standard of bowling from all
over the country, and although we
did not win, everyone had lots of
fun.
Canoeists sight Wales Volleyball invincible(ish)
A proposed trip to visit the Tyne
Tour, where many other university
clubs go, met with almost zero
enthusiasm. However, it was
noted that the forecast was for rain
in North Wales, so we could have a
cheap trip away to the hut.
Hooray!
The 6 hour drive up there was
unusual in that nothing appeared
to go wrong. No boats lost, no
trailer detachment, only the sounds
of eating from the back seats
(Adam and Sonia appeared to be
rather hungry all the way there).
Water appeared scarce on arrival,
but levels rose overnight, not sur-
prising given the rain.
After breakfast the Conwy was
picked as the river of choice for the
day, a fine paddle marred only by
Dean playing 'pop goes the shoul-
der'. Ross was then delegated to
fetch his car for the drive to
Llandudno A+E, while the rest of
us left Ginger Baldy (mk II) to look
after the rest of the club. The elite
team of silly boat paddlers then
headed on down for the harder
lower stretch. A fine chili and a
good performance in the pub fol-
lowed.
Sunday started a bit earlier, but
with the bonus of a flat tyre on the
trailer. We dumped it at the put in,
balanced on rocks while Ross again
skipped a morning's paddling.
Meanwhile everyone else was
herded down the easy upper
Glaslyn, uneventfully with the
exception of Nicky trying to
acquaint herself with the local trees
again, and Sonia collapsing due to
a lack of meat in her diet.
Finally we arrived at the
AberGlaslyn Gorge (scene of many
an epic), with the water fairly high.
Our new Nottingham boys went off
with the German nutters on the
first run, Ross, Tim, Garth (in
Adam's solid grade V boat) and
Mark followed, and caught them
when Ginger Baldy (mk II) and Ali
'the fish' swam, affording the rest
of us much amusement. A second
run was swiftly arranged, with Rich
City Boy taking Phil's recommend-
ed line, and discovered a new form
of fear in the back of his wetsuit
when he vertically pinned in it.
All in all, one of the best trips
we've ever done, with records for
attendance, female attendance,
and beers consumed.
Next trip: 11th-13th

ICVC v METS
Despite some of our main players failing to attend the game, IC boys
showed the Metropolitan police that they rule when it comes to action
on the court. A combination of Ming on setting, Bass's left hand and
Rados' sonic spike destroyed their defence and shook their confidence.
A breathtaking match ended up with 3-1 win and three valuable
points in the League table.
ICVC v UCL
The IC boys started the game with an unbeaten record so far in their
BUSA and league games. The sole aim was to keep it that way. With
coach Panos out of action and giving orders from the lidelines, the boys
won the first two sets.
However, thanks to an injury to Spyros the IC side then lost the third
set. Nevertheless, IC still secured an easy victory over their Central
London rivals - Final result a 3-1 win for ICVC.
ICVC v LSE
ICVC v Q M W
ICVC v UCL
Bang! Imperial Volleyball (Mixed and Girls teams) is here making their
presence felt with an exhilarating (yet unsurprising) three match winning
streak. The amazing series of conquests began with the 1C girls BUSA win
against LSE at home, a thrashing 2-0.
Next, the IC mixed team's nail-biting match against Queens Mary, a
thrilling win 2-1 led by fresh-faced captain Philippe Lebleu.
Disappointingly, after an unintentional tour of Euston in search of UCL's
sports centre, the IC girls eventually succumbed to a 0-2 defeat.
However, all is not lost, and the fight has just began!!
