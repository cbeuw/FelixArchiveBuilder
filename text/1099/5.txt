TIPSY TUTORIALS
Dear Jeremy,
As most members of the Elec
Eng department know, it was Dr.
John Cozens leaving party yester-
day (tuesday) at lunchtime. The
main advantage of this, (at least to
some of the students) was that at
least one of the study group tutors
gave out glasses of wine during her
session. 1 would like to offer my
thanks for this, as it certainly
livened the session up.
I would suggest more tutors try
something like this, as study group
attendances would certainly
increase.
Yours,
James Phillips, Elec Eng II
OPERA FIRST
Dear Editor,
I would like to congratulate
Felix for printing a useful preview of
an opera several weeks in advance,
so that I could book good seats.
Haydn's La Fedelta Premiata at the
Guildhall School of Music and
Drama was absolutely suberb, with
glorious music, excellent acting
and singing, and an extremely
funny production.
Thank you,
Dr Bernard Lamb, Biology.
BLOCK VOTE OR
DIVINE INTERVEN-
TION?
Dear Felix,
Nice to see a bit of raw anger in
last week's editorial. I must say that
1 do (for the most part) agree with
all the points made. For too long,
there has been an "us-and-them"
situation with St Mary's and events
like these only serve to fuel mis-
trust on both sides of Hyde Park. In
all subsequent elections, 1CSMU
has always advocated block voting
so, in fairness, this was to be
expected. However, a large part of
my anger points squarely at the
students who did not vote because
of either sheer idleness or plain
stupidity. To all those people; do
you really not care who runs your
union? Do you have a Union card?
Do you know what the black metal
box is?
Equally though, criticisms lev-
elled at the medics of being "child-
ish" are also important. I think that
by block voting, the medics are
effectively saying, "we can't think
for ourselves." Without being ironic
(1), surely all medics have a mind of
their own and can decide for them-
selves? This leads me to believe
that this was more of a political
assertion by ICSMU to ensure that,
despite us all being part of the
same College, they are, in all but
name, still a seperate entity. By
acting in this manner, the medics,
and in particular ICSMU exec, can
only expect contempt from other
students here (from those who can
actually be bothered to have an
opinion, that is). Grow up, St
Mary's exec, and wake up the rest
of you.
Detracting from criticism
(unusual for me, I know), I would
like to congratulate Charlie Joynt on
his victory. At least in this case,
there are no doubts that we have
the right man for the job. I would
also like to thank Simon Baker for
his highly flattering comments in
his column last week. Simon, your
cash is the post. Also, on a more
lighthearted note, have you ever
realised that Jeremy looks like
George Dawes (from Shooting
Stars) but with hair? Uncanny...
Regards,
Robert Emerson JMC2
Ok, let's clear this up right
away...
Thomson Dawes
Two things before I start: I do
not expect this to be published
(though it would be nice) and I am
writing not only for myself but after
several people have asked me to.
Felix is a the newspaper of the
Imperial College Students Union.
The student is made up of all the
constituent colleges, as was
explained to me when I came over
to Imperial for the hustings. ICSM
is now part of Imperial ans as such
it is highly inappropriate behaviour
from the editor of Felix to make the
comments that he made in his edi-
torial.
1 am not going to write here
that 1 was unbiased in the way that
I voted. Andi Heeps is a friend of
mine, but at the hustings I made
the effort to talk to Mark Baker to
find out for myself what he was like
because if he had been the better
candidate I would have voted for
him. Medical students, like most of
Imperial College students I am led
to believe, are blessed with minds
of our own. If certain factions
decide to throw in a block vote
then they are doing so of their own
free will and not because someone
has coerced them into doing so.
The way the votes are cast,
with each person filling in the vot-
ing slip themselves makes me
sceptical of how particular to
Mary's this "block vote" is. The sta-
tistics show that the South
Kensington campus voted over-
whelmingly in favour of Mark
Baker. This wouldn't have anything
to do with a block going on against
medics among the few students
that bothered to vote would it?
As a source of information and
comment for the students it is
Felix's responsibility to ensure that
people know that elections are tak-
ing place and to encourage as
many people to vote as possible
but in a non-partisan way. Instead
it appears that the editor threw his
personal backing behind one candi-
date and is now acting like a spoilt
child who has not got his own way.
This is not good journalsim and it is
certainly not the sort of behaviour
that 1 would expect from an intelli-
gent person who obviously realises
the power of position.
Since becoming involved in ICU
activities at the beginning of term
all I remember hearing is how badly
the ICU has been treated by
Mary's, Something I find hard to
believe given the fact that you out-
number them almost ten to one.
When 1 actually spoke to people in
a position to know at South
Kensington they denied that Mary's
was ever a trouble maker. I do not
