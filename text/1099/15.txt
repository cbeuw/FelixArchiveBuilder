ALBUMS
II
BLACK GRAPE
Stupid Stupid Stupid • • • •
Men in Black
Grape (Ahem).
W
ell then, Black Grape.
Where do we start?
Perhaps with the man
himself, Shaun Ryder. The stereo-
typical skinhead yob is actually not
the spiritual leader of England's
army of lager louts, but rather a
tuneful, music maestro. The evi-
dence for this bizarre statement
lies on his CV. Just underneath the
previous bands section you can
find listed The Happy Mondays.
Anyone who doesn't recall the
popularity of the phrase 'You're
twistin' my melon, man' is either
too young or was utterly oblivious
to what was happening during the
early 90's. As you're no doubt
aware, this featured the vocal tal-
ents of the aforementioned yob,
Mr. Ryder.
Unfortunately all good things
come to an end, so inviting some
of his mates (and some members
of the Mondays for good measure)
Shaun grouped together another
ensemble and from the ashes of
the Mondays rose Black Grape.
Their first album it's Great when
You're Straight...Yeah! went down a
storm as the guys themselves were
causing a storm on and off camera.
Shaun's confession to going to the
Hacienda in his younger days just
to steal women's handbags didn't
exactly aid Black Grape's appeal to
a wider audience. Mind you people
who are easily offended please
note - this album doesn't hold
back.
Commencing with Ronald and
Nancy Reagan's confessions to
drug addiction. Get Higher starts
the album as it means to go on, the
style of the album being similar to
their first. For the uninitiated this
entails lots of shouting and swear-
ing (often at the same time!) laced
over some damn fine tunes. Make
no mistake, you will be singing
along to the anthemic melody
lines, that scream out with energy
usually found in dextrol tablets.
Dadi was a Badi stands out, with
lyrics that home in on the band's
life growing up in and around
Manchester, and Money Back
Guaranteed gets a mention simply
for pure quality. These two are def-
inite future single contenders.
All in all a very listenable album
to get the old blood circulating as
the cold nights draw in. Black
Grape aren't going to win awards
for the profoundness of their lyrics,
but thumping out stuff to keep the
punters happy doesn't seem to do
Oasis any harm. In short, buy this
album, but don't play it to your
parents.

SINGLES
Naughty By Nature - Mourn You Til I join You
Superior hip-hop from one of the most consis-
tent outfits in the last ten years. Notably slick,
great rhymes; this is modern r'n'b at its best. A
live version of the Nothing To Lose soundtrack
title track is even better than the a-side with
oodles of their deliberate swagger and bass lines
that hit you right in the stomach.
Yo La Tengo - Little Honda
The hushed vocals and the steady riff remind
me of The Jesus and Mary Chain circa. The
Sound of Speed, but the gentle lyrical humour
lifts it to the standard you'd expect from
Matador Records. The true talent of the band is
glimpsed in the depth and quality of the b-sides,
all of which are absolute blinders.
Queen Latifa - It's Alright
'When I'm sexing you, when I'm next to you,
then I know it's alright'. Piss off, will you? Why
do all these records sound the same? Expertly
put together, wonderfully sung, produced to
death and an absolute waste of time.
Novacaine - Pond Life
Very average, plodding middle-of-the-road
American dull-rock. You can tell that they are
really trying very hard to be taken seriously, but
you get the feeling from this record that the
form has already been exhausted, which is a
very harsh thing to say about any record.
| T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Finley Quaye - It's Great When We're Together
Brimming over with groove, with an unforget-
table hook and as funky an arrangement of
strings, hammond organ, drums and bass as you
could wish for, this ultra laid back number has
the same feel as Lovely Day and has instant
classic written all over it.
Life of Agony - Desire
Terribly serious, moody, kind of Seal meets
Metallica ballad. 'Uncomfortable, feeling miser-
able, and I never want to change'; how many
pubescent rock outfits have thrown that lyric
out? Competent enough, but not very interest-
ing. That's it really.
Global Communication - The Groove
Searing trumpet and fluid percussion give out to
a magic acid jazz bass line, and there are a cou-
ple of deadly organ solos, but the whole thing is
let down by the one and only vocal; the end-
lessly repeated 'You've got to move to the
groove'. One of the remixes which cuts out the
vocals altogether is top notch.
Lotte - Somebody's Fool
'I'm exiting, sexy and cruel, but I'm just some-
body's fool'. Femme rock a la Brooks, No
Doubt, et al, though slightly less nauseating,
with a more imaginative guitar arrangement. The
delicate acoustic b-side 5fn December suits her
voice so much more, and almost makes the
record worth buying
The Verve - Lucky Man
Another solid single from Ashcroft and co.; per-
haps with a little less of the immediate appeal of
the last couple of records, and it goes a little too
much John Power on occasion. Not bad, but a
bit 'Verve-by-numbers'.
Way Out West - A/are 2
Gently put together, yet hard house music,
darkly arranged with an unintrusive, even dis-
tant, vocal part. Way Out West showing why
they are one of the most sought after dance
bands out there. All you need is a whistle and its
Ibiza 1994 all over again. H Mr. Trout
