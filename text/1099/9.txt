21 November 1997 COLUMNS
Thank Cod it's over. After more
elections in a year that Italy
manages, we finally have a pres-
ident. Congratulations to Messrs
Heeps and Joynt, who 1 am sure
will do what is required of them.
As usual, there is considerable dis-
quiet about the role of the medical
block vote, though I detect that
this time it is a little bit fiercer than
usual. Yes, on the face of it, it is a
disgrace. At first, it does appear to
be the pathetic action of an egotis-
tical union executive committee.
But this is unfair. We must consid-
er the special circumstances relat-
ing to medical schools. In a nut-
shell, they are not quite as sophis-
ticated as the South Ken mob, not
really capable of assimilating com-
plex issues and views. Evidence of
this is clear- one only needs to
look at the last round of Research
Assessments. The only ratings
below 4 were achieved by the
medics, thereby dragging down
the College down from its
deservedly lofty position. To be
fair, things will improve as these
new boys are brought under the
Imperial wing. St Mary's, for all
their talk of intellectual superiority,
used to get fairly dismal ratings,
but they have now redeemed
themselves under our guidance.
Mark my words, when we get
them all licked into shape, block
votes will become a thing of the
past and we shall be one big,
happy family.
Two weeks
ago I brought
worrying news
about the Holland
Club, the refuge ~—~
for many of us in
College. The sug- CT[ mK"
gestion was that
College Catering ^
were going to Q
take over control
of this august
o r g a n i s a t i o n . •—•
Fortunately, this IS)
not now the case,
according my old sparring partner
John Foster, Head of Catering. He
very kindly informed me that there
were never any plans to do so, and
1 am prepared to accept that at
face value. Less charitable souls
have suggested that this has all the
hallmarks of a U-turn, a view to
4 a f
which I do not subscribe. So that's
settled, I hope.
The media are much valued by
Imperial College, and rightly so.
Even in my own case, I know that
Lynda Davies, Head of PR, forever
sings my praises and never misses
my birthday. Ever keen to help the
gentlemen of
D
the Fourth
Estate, Lynda
and her people
' • I produce a
Media Guide, a
lavish • book that
lists all our
T ~ experts and their
t U chosen fields.
You want to
WgL \mj know who can
j B f — • solve your drug
J problems? Look
at the book.
Quark queries? It's all in there. Any
journalist would find it very helpful,
so they all get copies if they want
it. They also give a copy to all our
experts. Bearing in mind its quality
and size, this must cost a small
fortune, and the lucky recipients I
have spoken to all say that is of no
use to them whatsoever.
This Devil-may-care attitude
to costs is not new in
Sherfield, of course, but this is an
easy one to solve. Why not only
send it to people that want it, thus
saving a lot of time an a lot more
money, to be spent on something
useful such as undergraduate
teaching? Radical concept, eh? By
the way, the Felix Office didn't get
their copy... Look, keep your hair
on, Simon. The Felix office does
have a copy (although I picked it
up myself) and although it looks
expensive, it is relatively useful.

Finally, 1 hope I didn't bore you
too much this week, as Ali
Campbell suggested last week in
his piece. Funny, incisive, witty, all
words that no one could reason-
ably use to describe his article. To
be accused of tedium by a man
who wrote 400 words on the hilar-
ity of apportioning curry bills is a
marvellous case of Dear Pot, Yours
sincerely Kettle, I think you'll agree.
Thought for the day
No. 6: Ego
It's me! I'm beautiful! I
rock! I'm the greatest
man alive! I'm just so
perfect!
I never used to pay much atten-
tion in Latin lessons. I preferred
to carve the word "arse" into the
desk with a pen so that nothing
save an industrial sand blaster
could remove it, and copy my sec-
ond declension nouns off Peter
"ninety per cent or suicide" Dodd.
As a result, I shall leave the
translation of the word "ego" to
better-informed scholars.
Well, we've all got one. Some
people's are bigger than others'.
(Ego, that is). A good thing or a
bad one? All you young ladies
who tell me that an ego is the
most unattractive feature that a
gentleman can have seem to
reverse your allegiance when you
are drunk. Why is it that when I
spend three painstakingly ego-
free hours with a nice member of
the opposite sex, using all my
charm, wit, and the eyelashes
that Cod gave me (all right, there
is a bit of exaggeration going on
here, but bear with me), my
efforts are ruined by a self-
obsessed moron? Why does
some fat bloke with ether-
strength armpits, a beard that
went out of fashion in the Ice
Ages, a disgusting check shirt
that was cobbled together by his
grandmother, and above all, a
Hitler-size ego, stroll up and
spend approximately two min-
utes forty five seconds telling her
about how many pints he can
drink before she lets him stick his
mangy diseased tongue down her
throat? (Yes, I'm being really
bitchy here. There is no justice in
the world of courting. Any young
woman who is not in the "repul-
sive-men-are-ac tually-gorgeous-
after-a-few-pints" brigade, I'd
like to hear from you before I use
my column to inflict nineteen
years of sexual bitterness upon
the unsuspecting student popu-
lace.) How many people find that
those of their friends with the
biggest self-worship coefficient
are the most popular, while those
that try to be as ego-diminutive
as they possibly can are regarded
as soft, weak, unable to hold
their alcohol, or even of dubious
sexual standing?
All things considered, maybe I
should turn into an egotistical
lout so that I can begin to enjoy
myself a bit more. Women will
fall at my feet as I pepper them
with my fantastic guitar-strum-
ming abilities; friends will be pos-
sessed by true hero-worship
when I tell them about how I
once got 78% in a Physics test;
everyone will really appreciate my
boring them with knowledge of
obscure indie bands from the
early 1990s, and of economics
statistics from the 1980s. Hey, a
passport to popularity. Wait,
where are you going?
Beware. The ego is the path to
the world of the Spod. Avoid it at
all costs.
Ali Campbell
