Do you know what it is about edit-
ing Felix that really makes me livid?
What causes me to growl at people
and kick holes in the nearest piece
of expensive union-funded silicon-
based equipment? It's not the dis-
mally unreliable network system
that can only be placated by Mark,
it's not the unrelenting crapness of
Windows 95, it's not the slimey
trail left on the office floor by the
stream of whinging pitiful little
pricks who have nothing better to
do than interrupt my twenty-hour
shift of stress and deadlines with
their pathetic diatribes about how
their sport/club article didn't
receive cover-to-cover publicity
and it's not even the fax machine
that has clearly been placed on this
earth by satan himself to torment
innocents with paper jams, infuriat-
ing beeps and press releases from
crap bands you've never heard of.
No.
It's The Collator.
Five metres of grey metallic
evil. A ludicrous Heath-Robinson
shambles of pistons, blowers,
knockers, needles, suckers, mar-
bles (yes, really), bits of wire and
gaffer tape perfectly tuned to the
human mind so it can accurately

man. Professor Bob Schroter

Wheatley by Monday 24

gauge the number of breakdowns,
fires, compressed solid wads of
paper, failures, injuries and down-
right insolence required to drive its
operators to the edge of psycho-
logical breakdown but without get-
ting itself smashed back into the
small pieces of demonic putrefac-
tion from whence the fucker came.
From the staple head that reg-
ularly snaps half-inch thick steel
bits off itself, to the "issue counter"
that delivers nothing but random
numbers; from the folder that more
closely resembles an industrial
shredder to the air pump that
expends 90% of its power produc-
ing a ear-piercing howl; from the
needle clamps that exist only to
pierce your finger to the bone, to
self-mutilating paper bins of hell.
1 hate it. It hates me. If you're
reading this now, it's only because
The Collator's arcane crevices that
usually serve as hiding places for
errant pages are already full of bits
of my own flesh and blood. So
don't you complain if one of your
pages is upside down; it's four in
the morning and I'm standing knee
deep in ruined copies of Felix, sixty
hours in the making and all I really
want to do is kill someone.
