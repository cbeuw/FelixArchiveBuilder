FILM 19
EXCESS BAGGAGE
Starring: Alicia Silverstone, Harry Connick Jr, Christopher Walken
Director: Marco Brambilla
T
he "Excess Baggage" of the
title refers to Alicia
Silverstone, though her pro-
duction company obviously didn't
realise how appropriate this is con-
sidering the two excellent actors
alongside her. In a worryingly verti-
cal career move Miss Silverstone
plays spoilt brat Emily T. Hope,
who stages her own kidnapping in
order to attract the attention of her
career-obsessed father (Jack
Thompson). She foolishly locks
herself in the boot of her car to
await her pick up, clearly not antic-
ipating the presence of a car thief
(Del Toro) and the inevitable hilar-
ious consequences. But there's
more to it than that. On
discovering his, wait for it... excess
baggage, it's only a matter of time
before the sex kitten's fuse is flam-
ing as she falls for the reckless
rogue.
With a large number of average
to pretty good films currently on
release there are few reasons to go
out of your way for this one. A
great piece of daring and original
casting has Walken as Emily's men-
acing and on-the-edge uncle who
goes looking for her, and Del Toro
is also pretty good doing his
Fenton in The Usual Suspects act.
But we've seen these things before,
and in much better films. The
director, Marco Brambilla (of
Demolition Man fame - if such a
thing exists) does a reasonable job
technically speaking, though there's
fairly little life to it all - the question
of why anyone would want to film
such a dire screenplay in the first
place will probably haunt everyone
who sees the film. At least for the
five or so minutes in which it
remains in their minds. Of

Excess Baggage?
Surely not.
REGENERATION
Starring: Johnathan Pryce
James Wilby
Director:Gillies Mackinnon
T
he suffering and horror of war
are rarely portrayed in films,
mainly because such trivial
concerns tend to ruin heroic action
sequences. The handful of excep-
tions (eg Apocalypse Now) is now
greatly enriched by Regeneration, a
film full of deeply disturbing and
harrowing images. Adapted from
the novel by Pat Barker, it tells the
story of Dr William Rivers (Pryce),
the renowned psychiatrist in
Craiglockart Castle, a 13th century
keep just outside Edinburgh which
was used as a military hospital for
shell-shocked soldiers during the
first world war. Rivers himself is on
the edge of a breakdown as a result
of his involvement with his
patients. They include Siegfried
Sassoon (Wilby), a brilliant and
heroic soldier who is by no means
mentally disturbed, but has been
sent to the asylum for publishing an
outspoken - and illegal - pamphlet
proclaiming his opposition to the
war. Sassoon strikes up a
friendship with fellow patient
Wilfred Owen (Stewart Bunce),
encouraging him to write some of
the finest poetry to emerge during
the war (and indeed this century).
Seemingly unconstrained by the
film's modest budget, Regeneration
is brilliantly directed by Gillies
Mackinnon, who manages to draw
faultless performances from the
entire cast and crew. Even the
romantic sub-plot of Billy's love
affair with Sarah (Tanya Allen in her
feature film debut) - turns out to be
essential to the film as it is used as
a contrast to the devastation of
war. Essentially the film is more
about humanity and the nature of
mind rather than war itself. It works
at a very subtle level, showing
respect for its audience by not forc-
ing any viewpoint upon them whilst
confronting them wjth their own
morality. You will need to take your
brain with you for this one but it's
worth the effort. Alternatively, leave
it at home and wait for the new
Bond film, also starring Johnathan
Pryce, which is what most film
goers will end up doing. It's a crazy
world... D
