Astronaut wannabes want to experience this a n d m u c h m o r e . Constant
weightlessness - a free-fall parachutist's heaven. N o u p ot d o w n (think
about thai one!}. Science, without the interference o f significant gravita-
tional forces. Liquid droplets suspended in air. T h e expansion of mankind
and the desire to colonise other planets. T h e search for extra-terrestrial
life. Through one window magnificent views of mother Earth that no pic-'
ture can emulate, seen without borders between countries. T h r o u g h
another window, stars brighter than any seen on Earth. T h e s e a r e s o m e of

Although becoming an astronaut may be. on every five-year-old's letter lo
Santa this Christmas, only around 2000 people apply to NASA every,
year. So why does the dream lade?
13 The most obvious reason is the level of danger involved - there is a
one in a hundred chance of not surviving (although the odds are con-
stantly improving, and no-one has died in either the Russian or US space
23 Becoming an astronaut is not a gateway to amassing vast amounts of
money - rates of pay for astronauts {particularly Russian cosmonauts) are
"unlikely to be comparable with salaries in the "real world"., and the only
likeiy way of earning serious money comes from a post-retirement media

approximately 10 individuals to join the astronaut corps every year.
Successful applicants are those that pass through each stage of the inten-
sive selection procedure. During each stage, the quality of the remain-
ing applicants are assessed; these qualities cover not only the relevance
& experience of academic study, but also personality, leadership, team-
work and any other achievements. The final 100 or so applicants are
assessed by interview, and are chosen according to the interview's
results and the preferences of veteran astronauts.

Columbus' expedition to the west of America in 1642 is a classic exam-
ple. The money used in space flight could be put t o other uses, yes, but
th.it will not solve the world's problems. There will always be rich and
poor, healthy and sick - but these factors do not necessarily determine the
happiness of people. Put simply, there will never be enough resources to
go round. That is one of the reasons for extending our civilisation beyond

The first year's training allows NASA to deduce the strengths and weak-
nesses of each candidate. Only after successful completion of this one-
year course are trainees eligible to be chosen for a mission.
One of the biggest problems faced by astronauts when they first fly
is space sickness syndrome. Fast movements, particularly of the head,
can be followed by nausea and headaches. Other than being unpleas-
ant for the astronaut, precious time is wasted due to its effects. To test a
candidate's ability to work under such conditions a rotating chair is
used. The astronaut is strapped into the seat and must try to operate var-
ious controls while spinning, if this test is. passed, the candidate prcv
ceeds to an elevator, the movements of which (for the sake of common
decency) are best left to the imagination! Either way, the test is not over
until the astronaut has l>eeii sick! Also taken within the year are lessons
which cover all aspects of space flight, sport to remain fit, and safety
procedures in case of disaster.
