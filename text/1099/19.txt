FOOTBALL SHORTS
Vin Shanley
C
alvin and Hobbes. The Book
of Insults. Last month's
FHM. They're all "dippers."
They all sit nicely on top of the cis-
tern in your bathroom. All ready to
be "dipped in" whenever conve-
nient. Toilet reading material. Isn't
it brilliant? You can read however
much you want and stop. You
don't have to finish a chapter or
find out what happens next. I
mean, since when did anyone ever
read War and Peace on the bog?
Football Shorts is lavatory liter-
ature for the football fans. There
are hundreds of short anecdotes
from King Eric, quotes from "Turnip
Taylor" and gaffes that Tony Banks
would be proud of. The author
tackles subjects systematically,
dealing with managers, players,
goalies, referees, clubs and fans in
separate chapters. However, this
isn't a book that you just read
straight through. You pick it up
now and again, open it up at a ran-
dom page and just read a few
paragraphs.
Plenty of quirky facts can be
found: Some Americans thought
that Glen Hoddle was a malt
BOOKS
whisky. David Ginola is an anagram
ofvagina dildo! Perhaps the
strangest is the church in Surrey
that had footballer's shirts draped
on the pews and flags in the aisle
for a footballer's service. The vicar
even opened his sermon with a
few short blasts on a referee's
whistle!
The best and funniest section
by far, though, is the gaffes chap-
ter. It's packed with a collection of
commentating cock-ups. There's
Alan Ball's "I'm not a believer in
luck, although I do believe you
need it", John Motson's "The World
Cup - truly an international event"
and Gazza's infamous " I never
predict anything and 1 never will
do." In essence, this is a football
book but I think its appeal is very
general. So, if your toilet is short of
a good dipper, you could do a lot
worse than this.

ust like an alcoholic hits the bottle,
a trucker hits the road. Stunned by
the news that his long time girl-
friend is pregnant and has decided
by herself to have an abortion, Josh
Spiller gets into his electric blue
Peterbilt and takes the first load he can
find that'll take him out of town. You
see, he feels comfortable sat in
Jezebel with the radio and CB fighting
for his aural attention. He can just let
himself slip into a trance and not
worry about anything. The problem is
he's been on the road well beyond the
legal limit. So, as he drives the through
the strangely affluent town of Furnace
looking for a place for a quick nap and
a coffee, the unthinkable occurs. As he
approaches a crossroads, a woman
seems to appear at the side of the
road and pushes a baby with its pram
under the truck. Josh breaks but he's
too late and this is where his night-
mare begins.
The memory is etched into his
mind but the image is torn. Witnesses
report that there was no woman, just
a gust of wind. The police play on
Josh's fatigue and try to make him
change his statement, as the woman
he describes is actually the highly
respected town councillor, Nelly
McFarlane. Josh is confused: No-one
is angry at him, no-one is condemn-
ing him for his carelessness and the
sheriff, John Pace, is insisting that he
just gets as far away from Furnace as
possible. Josh leaves quickly but car-
ries a demonic curse with him. He has
three days to live and the only way to
reverse it is to go back and uncover
Furnace's dark secrets.
One-time co-presenter of The
Clothes Show, this is Muriel Gray's
second novel. (Her debut being The
Trickster.) The main priority in a book
of this sort is to give the reader some-
thing they can identify with so that
they actually care about what hap-
pens and if it wasn't for Josh's finely
tuned sarcasm, the main character
would come across as a whining pain.
As it is, though, he makes us laugh
just enough for us to sympathise with
him. The story moves very quickly. In
fact, it could easily be made into a
trash TV movie. There's nothing par-
ticularly bad about that. It's an enjoy-
able read but inevitably trash lacks
substance. Apart from the early acci-
dent, it fails to capture you as it did
then. However, it is tightly written.
You may not be monstrously excited
but you won't be bored either. This is
only Muriel Gray's second novel and I
can see her getting better as she con-
tinues. Could be one to look out for in
a few years time.

HE DIED WITH A
FELAFEL IN HIS
HAND
John Birmingham * * *
"He died...." is basically a history of
the 89 flatmates the author had dur-
ing eight years of house sharing. The
book is at times hilarious and always
entertaining as the author races
through the series of freaks and crazy
anecdotes. For those of you who are
sharing flats, I would expect that the
book would have an added punch to
it. The book really works because of
characters such as 'Thunderbird Ron',
a socially inept bodybuilder and PJ, a
fish finger addict. There is also a clear
Imperial student - 'Brainthrust
Leonard1
, "a gawky third-year engi-
neering student with an unrivalled
back catalogue of Star Trek fanzines
and Australian Playboys". Sound like
anyone you know?
The chapters in the book deal on
particularly embarrassing or notable
events - such as destroying a house-
warming after getting completely
stoned in the 'Horny London Babes
Fiasco' (it's set in Australia by the
way), or deal with one particular
activity - such as his enjoyment of lis-
tening to fellow flatmates having sex.
Interposed between chapters are the
'Voices of the damned" - confessions
by acquaintances on the terrible
things that they had done. These are
especially amusing, so 1 won't ruin
them for any of you. 1 should proba-
bly warn people with a delicate dis-
position that they may not enjoy this
book as much as I did, and they may
prefer 'Pride and Prejudice' or some-
thing instead. Small paragraph sec-
tions by friends detailing their worst
flat sharing experiences is a nice
touch and it increases the nightmares
per page rating.
It obviously is not a book with
great literary or scientific worth - but
its not meant to have any. I would
definitely recommend this book - bor-
row it from someone if you can.
Anyone looking for flatmates
should definitely read it to find
out the danger signs of possi-
ble psychopaths and anyone should
read it because it is very funny. It's a
good quick read (I read it in an
evening, but I did have to review it)
and people with a sick sense of
humour should enjoy it more than
most, especially the bits about
blokes wanking off dogs ....
