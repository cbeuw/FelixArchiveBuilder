MALAY MAYDAY BMA DEALS
BLOW TO ANTI-
DRUGS LOBBY
It has been suggested by the
Times Higher Education Supp-
lement that the removal of tax
concessions for studying abroad
from Malaysia would have the sig-
nificant effect on university
income. Since Malaysian students
are considered 'overseas stu-
dents' they are obliged to pay a
tuition fee much higher than self-
supporting home students.
For example, in Imperial
College an Engineering Under-
graduate course for a self-sup-
porting student would cost about
£750 per annum, while for an
overseas student it would cost
more than £9000. It has also
been mentioned in the Times
Higher Education supplement that
the potential fee income from the
18,000 Malaysian postgraduates
and undergraduates would
exceed £130 million.
PRAED STREET
RAPES
St Mary's Union are warning stu-
dents and staff to be on their
guard, after two women were
raped in the road adjacent to the
medical school. The women were
attacked in separate but similar
incidents where they were app-
roached from behind by a man
with a knife, who then forced
them into a nearby vehicle driven
by an accomplice. Both women
were subsequently gang-raped.
Rob Clark, lCU's Deputy President
(FfkS), has also urged students to
exercise caution in the area.
On Tuesday, the British Medical
Association published the first
major report on the therapeutic
use of cannabis. It drew distinc-
tions between recreational and
medicinal uses of the drug; thou-
sands of people currently resort
to the illegal use of cannabis in an
attempt to ease the symptoms of
cancer, muscle spasticity, pain,
anorexia, epilepsy, glaucoma,
bronchial asthma, mood disorders
and psychiatric conditions, and
hypertension. It is also thought to
ease the joints of arthritis suffer-
ers. Most of the prior claims of
pain relief from the drug has been
anecdotal, but the report exam-
ines the scientific evidence for the
wider medicinal use of cannibi-
noids (cannabis derivatives); it
sets a future research agenda and
identifies the legal steps that need
to be taken before new treat-
ments can be developed. It sug-
gests that advice should be given
from the W H O to the UN
Commission on Narcotic Drugs to
reschedule certain cannibinoids
under the UN Convention on
Psychotropic Substances. If that
fails, the Government is to con-
sider changing the Misuse of
Drugs act to permit the prescrip-
tion of certain cannibinoids to
patients whose symptoms are
inadequately controlled under
present arrangements.
Careers Fair Fares
Well
IVAN CHAN
This year's careers fair has
received a record turn-out both
in terms of the number of stu-
dents that has visited the fair as
well as the number of companies
which were involved.
In total 1500 brochures were
distributed throughout the day
within the Union Building. There
were more than forty companies
attending the Fair. The three largest
venues within the Union Building
were used. The Union Concert Hall,
Union Dining Hall and the Union
Gym were packed with employers,
their stalls and job-hunting stu-
dents during the day. One visitor
commented "1 think that this gives
us an good opportunity to try and

decide what do with our lives in the
future."
According to Mark Home, the
Events and Marketing manager of
Imperial College Union, the com-
panies are "very happy and had
very nice things to say about aver-
age IC student."
This year's careers fair was
organised by ICU, arranged by Mr
Home and ICU Office Manager
Michelle Lewthwaite during the
summer and into this term. It has
been the biggest independent stu-
dent union-organised fair in the
UK. Students can also use the
Careers Office in the Sherfield
Building throughout the year.
RCS Union Finally Elects President
ANDY SINHARAY
After a summer of administrative
turmoil the RCSU Elections took
place last week, only a couple of
days after those of Imperial
College Union. Though only
around 200 votes were cast, the
turnout of 11% was comparable
to that of the recent ICU
Elections.
The former RCSU vice-presi-
dent, Rob Park, told Felix that there
had been no logistical problems. "It
was slow," he said, commenting on
the progress of the proceedings.
"Turnout was lower than 1 hoped,
but it wasn't surprising," he said,
going on to cite the timing of the
elections being so close to those of
ICU and the time of year. The new
president of the RCSU is Physics
PhD student Helen-Louise
Windsor, who beat her only oppos-
er, Hooman Behnia, by 98 votes to
45; 40 voted for new Election. "The
overall turnout was so poor," she
commented, and said that during
her campaign she had encountered
confusion and even ignorance from
voters about which elections she
was standing for. On the question
of the relevance of the Kensington
CCUs, she was convinced that they
still have a role in the modern IC. "1
wouldn't have stood for a role in a
CCU of I believed they didn't have a
future," and went on to mention
their potential importance after the
medical merger. Rufina Emo and
Dave Wharton were jointly elected
for the post of Vice President, and
were the only candidates standing.
The job of Academic Affairs Officer
was similarly taken by Phil Smith
and Nic Thompson.
