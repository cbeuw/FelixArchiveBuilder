BJORK
Shepherds Bush Empire
Bjork looking
most definitely
not, Violently
Happy.
T
he Empire is privileged tonight
to host the infused talent that
is Bjork. Call her what you like,
the Icelandic princess, the quirky
weird singer who likes a bit of wail-
ing and screaming now and again
or just plain Bjork. The result is
always guaranteed to be the same,
sheer class and stylish stage pres-
ence.
The backdrop was a funky mix
and mash of paper streamers that
created an eerie effect of a living
forest under the glare of the lights.
Initially the backing musicians
entered the stage, eight string play-
ers in all, including two double
bassists. Unlike her previous HUGE
scale tour(she played Wembley
Arena last time), this time round
she has decided against playing all
the instruments live, probably more
to do with the fact that it is a much
shorter affair.
The woman herself came on to
the sound of Hunter, opener off
Homogenic, and the whole set
started off like a dream. Clever
lighting kept Bjork's face in the dark
throughout this track, creating an
air of mystery to her already
unfathomable persona. She shot
through the set with a number of
top class tracks, Homogenic pro-
viding the majority of the material,
though it was spread pretty evenly
over all three albums. Inevitably she
has now got such a large reper-
toire, she can't play all the tracks
you hope to hear. Those lacking
tonight were classics like Big Time
Sensuality and Army Of Me, but
thankfully she restrained from play-
ing the pompously chartophilic It's
Oh So Quiet. What she missed out
on were more than made up for by
the outstandingly gorgeous songs
that blended perfectly with her
magnificent voice (you either love it
or loathe it). The crowd showed
their appreciation by the obviously
positive reception given to each
tune, especially in Violently Happy
where the rare sight of pogoing
was exhibited. One candid moment
in the set was during a recent track
lifted from the new LP when she
sang '....Baby!', as though she was
trying to do an uncanny imperson-
ation of Madonna. She, even man-
aged to laugh at this embarissingly
schizophrenic remark. The string

^^•fhis is an album that simply
I hasn't been out of my CD
Jl player since I got hold of it
(and yes 1 do have other CD's). It is
quite simply one of the best e
pies of no-messing jazz-stepping
drum 'n' bass availible.
It starts off with a funky bongo
and wah-wah jam that makes you
think it's about to break into the
Shaft theme music. What is does
turn into is something altogther
more different - the masterful.
Some of the mixes on the

been released. However, the blend
of samples and less hectic beats
makes the album a much mellower
listen and the whole thing hangs
together really well. It's clear from
the start that this album is not des-
tined for the dancefloor but has
been put together for listening
pleasure.
This is just one of those albums
which sounds like a greatest hits
players orchestrated their sounds
with the pounding emotion cap-
tured in all of her albums while the
basic foundations of the tracks
have moved away from your nor-
mal everyday beats present on the
first two albums to slightly more
irregular rhythms and scathing,
scraping sampled beats.
Undoubtedly the most heartfelt
track off Homogenic is joga but live
something seemed to be missing,
leaving you cheated of an expected
masterpiece. However this was
probably the only flaw tonight in an
otherwise complete set. What I
was mainly struck by was the rela-
tive simplicity of the new material
in comparison to the complexity of
her earlier solo work.

Bjork herself has said that
Homogenic is in itself her first
proper solo album, where she has
moved away from the influence of
the Sugarcubes. This is no bad
thing, although most of the tunes
form her previous band (and they
did plenty) were pretty impressive
themselves. Her music may be
more stripped down and organic
now but this just helps to e n h a n d
her incredible singing talent which
can't be beaten when heard live.
