IC Students Barred Rag Week Dead?
continued from page one
plain." He said that they have been
billed for the cost of one table,
which has been settled from dona-
tions by the club members. He
went on to say that from "internal
enquiries" that the footballers had
made, it was not clear that 1CUAFC
had been unambiguously responsi-
ble. The Hammy Ten, he told Felix,
attracted other people from out-
side the club such as "girlfriends,
flatmates and friends." Mr Dunsby,
a third year maths student, report-
ed that the group was "loud and
drunk... high-spirited and singing.
Kids and beer, they just don't mix."
When asked about the damage, he
said that they had gone to apolo-
gise to two of the pubs that had
complained to ICU.
In a written statement to ICU
Council, the outgoing Union
President Eric Allsop said that "the
Union disciplinary committee was
not well placed to deal with the
true nature of the crime (ie not just
bring the Union into disrepute but
the College as well) and [have]
passed the issue up to the College
disciplinary."
College Tutor, Dr Gareth Jones,
said "it's very bad and has certain-
ly harmed the College... the
College takes a serious view....I am
going to visit the pubs and find out
first hand from the publicans.
These pubs now have a very bad
opinion of IC students and it will
take some time to correct that."
He said that the football club are
very reluctant to reveal identities
and it will be difficult to take to a
disciplinary. He declined to specu-
late on the outcome of the College
inquiries.
The enquiry was underway as
Felix was going to press.

The St Mary's Union (ICSMSU)
has been hit for the first time
with unforseen costs amounting
to £30,000, their bill for the use
of the Recreation Centre in
Wilson House.
The Centre provides sports
facilities for all the clubs and soci-
eties within Imperial College,
although the amenities are pre-
dominately used by those in the St
Mary's Medical School.
Until this year, all costs for use
of the Centre by the medics have
been met by the St Mary's Finance
Department. A recent reassess-
ment of this policy has meant that
the £30,000 fee would be trans-
ferred to the ICSMSU. This left the
Union with an overspend of
£25,000 on top of their £43,000
budget, which has been covered by
the St Mary's Finance Department.
In order to cover this year's costs,
Katie Armstrong, the 1CSMSU
President has requested an extra
£25,000 to be earmarked.
It has not yet been made clear
as to how the situation will be han-
dled, although Ms Armstrong, said
that Tim Clarke, Pro Rector, was
"being absolutely fantastic" in eas-
ing the situation. Final decisions
have yet to be made as to how the
facilities will be charged for in
future years but Mike Hansen,
Director of Finance, said that "deci-
sions will not be made until
February" but "the Union cannot be
expected to pay all the charges
being made."
Imperial College Union's Indian
Society staged its annual
cultural festival on Wednesday
night to an 800 strong crowd in
the Great Hall, writes fiten Patel.
The act which appeared to steal
the show was, ironically, a stu-
dent from Queen Mary &. West-
field College who performed a
dance routine to Michael
Jackson's "Who is it?"
A fashion show followed (photo

western clothes being worn by
students from Imperial College.
The clothes were provided by
Venisons, Raymonds and
Ciro Citerio.
Reactions to the event were uni-
versally positive. One student
commented that it was "fantas-
tic and even better than last year."

The traditional Imperial College
Union Rag Week may have 'died a
death', it emerged this week.
Felix has learned that Rag Week
ground to a halt due to what
appears to have been a lack of
organisation. Last week's Royal
College of Science Union Beer
Festival was intended to have
marked the beginning of Rag
Week.
The events were to include the
C&.G Union Slave Auction, the
Sponsored Nude Kamikaze Para-
chute Jump (which abandoned due
to an apparent lack of participants)
culminating with Firewalking, which
was also cancelled. Rob Park, the
ex-RCSU vice-president who ran
the Beer Festival, said "personally, 1
don't think they got organised...
there was a lack of communication
over the summer." The Beer
Festival, which took place in the
junior Common Room on
Wednesday 12, was organised by
the RCSU Rag staff, who are sepa-
rate from those at ICU.
Outgoing ICU President, Eric
Allsop, told Felix that the week "may
have died a death through a lack of
organisation." He also thought that
it was possible that other factors
could be to blame such as the
events not seeming relevant to
today's students, in addition to
poor publicity. "It only dawned on
me that it was Rag Week when I
heard of the Beer Festival," he said,
adding that ultimately the charities
IC supports would stand to lose the
most, and that ICU Rag would be
shamed by the larger Rag collec-
tions of St Mary's and Charing Cross
Medical Schools.
The ICU Rag Chair, Louise
Choo, was not available for
comment.
