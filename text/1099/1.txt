IC Students Barred
After Football Fracas
MARIA IOANNOU &.
ANDYSINHARAY
ICU Association Football Club
(ICUAFC) is to be investigated by
College officials after allegedly
causing damage during a pub
crawl, leading to all IC students
being barred from at least two of
the pubs.
The pub crawl, traditionally
called the 'Hammy Ten', occurred
on Wednesday 29 October, and
saw ten Hammersmith pubs visited
by a large group of students.
According to the ICUAFC Press
Officer, Simon Dunsby, about two-
thirds of the group were from the
ICU football club. A number of pub
landlords have alleged that stu-
dents were being rowdy and were
abusive to other punters. According
to a member of the bar staff at The
Dove Inn on the Upper Mali, who
claimed to have been on duty that
evening, they received a telephone
warning from another pub, The Old
Ship, saying that the students "had
just started a ruckus".
He said that after the students
had left, they went out to "check
the back" where they discovered
that a table had been thrown into
the adjacent River Thames and that
bathroom plumbing had been
ripped out and toilet seats taken
off. However he went on to tell
Felix that "it wasn't really a big
deal... most of the students were
out for a good time... most of them
were nice kids. It was just a small
handful of maybe five or six". At the
next pub, the Blue Anchor, a bar-
man said that "the students were
abusive to staff... and insisted on
standing on chairs and singing." He
then went onto say that Police
were called. It was later discovered
that parasols had been thrown in
the river. A member of staff at The
Rutland added that the students
were being "extremely obnoxious...
they were abusive to the landlord
and they started dropping glasses
on the floor blatantly. When we
asked them to leave, they threw
umbrellas and a table into the
river... there's moorings down the
way, and it's a worry to the boat
people. It could ruin a boat."
Donal Keane, a captain of
ICUAFC and a third year aeronau-
tics student said, "We feel a bit
hard done by, but we don't have a
leg to stand on. We can't com-

I deserve an Oscar, says Mayhew
JITEN PATEL
Sir Patrick Mayhew, former
Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, arrived under a tight veil
of security on Wednesday after-
noon to address ICU Con-
servative Society.
Sir Patrick talked on a variety of
issues. He voiced his worries over
the implementation of a minimum
wage, standards within education
and the statutory internment of
terrorists. The floor was then
opened to the audience, with the
bulk of the questions based around
the situation in Northern Ireland.
With regard to his role in the Ulster
peace process, a modest Sir
Patrick commented that "if I was
ever given any awards I should
have been given an Oscar."
He was also asked about his
views on the disclosure of party
funding and said that "if people are
supporting a party with donations
over Â£5,000 then why would they
want to hide it?" His talk ended
with a quote from Lord Hailsham:
"Remember the left is never right."
