The College also owns
various properties outside cen-
tral London. Silwood Park near
Ascot was acquired in 1947 and
a Field Station was established
there. The Royal School Of
Mines has owned the
Tywarnhale Tin Mine in
Cornwall since 1909. Imperial
College also has an affiliated
project in South Wales.
Imperial Pare began develop-
ment in Newport in 1991. It is a
science park dedicated to
research and development and
has strong links with industry.
The next substantial develop-
ment affecting Imperial College
could be Albertopolis. Although
plans are still sketchy and
attracting a healthy amount of
criticism, some redevelopment
looks inevitable. The College
has recently been described as
an eyesore in the South
Kensington area by a writer for
a national newspaper. Perhaps
today's administrators realise
that the appearance of the
College can be as crucial as its
research papers in the interest of
self-promotion.
