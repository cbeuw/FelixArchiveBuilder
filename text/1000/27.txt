College life, particularly to
methods of studying. Sir Ronald
predicts that "within five years
if we could afford it, or maybe a
little bit longer, I'd expect the
whole College to be on a fibre-
optic net, with outlets in all
College premises and in student
residence rooms. People could
simply take their
laptop, plug in,
get the week's
problems, do
them, then trans-
mit them back.
Maybe examina-
tions will be
done that way."
Lectures and
c o n v e n t i o n a l
libraries will still
have their place,
however.
Alien Science
For Sir Ronald,
e n c o u r a g i n g
interdisciplinary
research efforts
at the College is
the most impor-
tant thing he
could achieve
while Rector:
"For the future
vigour of the College, we are
going to have to move into
interdisciplinary areas. We've
done that effectively in some
areas but not in others."
He adds that the divisions
between subjects are as much a
matter of historical accident as
logic. "If an alien being arrived
on the earth tomorrow, looked
at the sum of human scientific
and technological knowledge
and was then asked to divide it
into convenient chunks for
teaching and administration, it's
not clear that the subjects of
physics, chemistry and biology
would emerge," he explains.
As the future role of Imperial
College as a university takes
shape, the face we show to the
outside world may soon be
altered dramatically. A scheme
to revitalise South Kensington
as a centre for science and arts
in the next millennium was
announced earlier this year,
under the title of 'Albertopolis'.
The proposal is the result of
two years of discussions
between Imperial College and
other institutions in the area.
The challenge was how to
improve the South Kensington
site to meet the demands of the
next century.
It quickly became apparent
that the aims of individual insti-
tutions could benefit from a
joint development of the sur-
rounding area. The idea of
Albertopolis emerged naturally
from these discussions.
The Albertopolis plans include a remodelled Queen's Lawn with
the Queen's Tower surrounded by a reflecting pool.
Designs on the Future
Sir Norman Foster and Partners
were the architects chosen to
produce a plan for the area.
Their proposed solution would
provide better public access and
amenities. It would unify the
institutions physically and allow
them to interact more easily
with one another.
The project name - a work-
ing title - is a tribute to Prince
Albert, whose original vision
led to the South Kensington we
see today.
In the twenty-first century, an
Imperial College student would
arrive at South Kensington
underground station to be greet-
ed by the Millennium Mall - an
underground street running the
length of Exhibition Road. It
would provide direct access to
the three museums and the other
Albertopolis services, including
information centres, ticket
offices and shops.
A Facelift for Imperial College
Most important for Imperial
College are the plans to remodel
its unattractive fagade. The
main change would be improve-
ments to the Queen's Lawn area
to give the College a social
focus. More green areas would
be created and car-parking
would be relocated from
Imperial College Road.
Meanwhile, a new building
would be built on top of the cur-
rent mechanical engineering
building. Professor John Archer,
Pro-Rector of
Imperial College
describes the
new building as
"a shop window
for what we do at
Imperial, provid-
ing facilities for
lectures and
exhibitions. I
would hope that
it would allow
the public to get
a better under-
standing of the
science going on
at the College."
E x h i b i t i o n s
focussing on the
future by the
Royal College Of
Art would also
be displayed.
According to
Professor Archer,
the Albertopolis
project means that "the site
could be restored to some of its
former splendour as a centre for
science and the arts."
Albertopolis will be expen-
sive, so the future of the project
depends on money from the
Millennium Fund. This is being
set up from proceeds from the
National Lottery. The Fund is
intended to finance a range of
projects to commemorate the
next century.
Ian Caldwell, Imperial
College Estates Manager, thinks
that the Albertopolis bid has
unique advantages: "It's more
large scale than the others...it is,
in a sense, a regeneration pro-
ject and has the extra economic
benefit of helping science, tech-
nology and medicine."
Some have made grand
claims for the Albertopolis
scheme: "This could become a
model for the rest of London,"
says Spencer de Grey, who
leads the design team.
Sir Ronald Oxburgh is more
cautious: "I don't see that great
or profound an effect, but it
would make Imperial a far more
attractive place to study."
What The Students
Think About
Albertopolis
"They should change the
name!"
"Well, they can't make
Mech Eng look any worse."
"I'm not going to be here,
so I don't care."
"It might make South
Kensington more expen-
sive for students."
"I'd rather they spent the
money on better student
accommodation."
The Year Ahead
At Imperial College
"We're negotiating a big
expansion of Union facili-
ties at present, with the
first priority being a sec-
ond-hand bookshop."
Lucy Chothia, next year's
Union President
"Accommodation at the
moment is variable...it
doesn't really seem what
tomorrow's scientists
should be living in while
students and that's a high
priority for me."
Dan Look, next year's
Deputy President (Finance
& Services)
"My main aim next year is
to get more sponsorship for
clubs and societies."
Ian Parish, next year's
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies)
