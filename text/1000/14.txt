Felix 1000th Edition
The Imperial College Libraries recently merged
with the Science Museum Library, providing a more
extensive range of facilities. The library contains
both fiction and non-fiction books as well as a
selection of music cassettes and CDs. Amenities
elsewhere on the campus include a bookstore and a
travel agent used by both the students and staff.
