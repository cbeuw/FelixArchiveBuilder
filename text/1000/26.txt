don't you?"

palm and traced the lines there.
"It's a time of great change
for you," she crooned. No great
surprise, considering I'd just
graduated from university. But
then I was never very
impressed by any 'predic
tions' of the future.

I'm not sure what I'll do," said
one student; a sentiment echoed
by many in their final year.
But what about the future of
the College itself, what predic-
tions can we make about that?
Who better to ask than the
Rector of Imperial College, Sir
Ronald Oxburgh. He believes
that the College must "stay aca-
demically nimble so that we
can exploit the shifts and
changes in science and
technology as they
come along and
at the
front."
Life Becoming Hard
Examples of the interaction
between the life and hard
sciences range from biocompat-
ibility - the engineering of
artificial organs to avoid tissue
rejection - to the use of infor-
mation technology by doctors.
Genetic engineering is another
important example.
Current plans for a new
Biomedical Centre would
provide a focus for such inter-
disciplinary research at the
College. Sir Ronald explains
that negotiations are under
way with a number of other
institutions, such as the National
Heart & Lung Institute, with a
view to them becoming part of
Imperial College.

only reveals its
secrets one second at a

Which leaves an interesting
problem when writing about the
future of Imperial College.
Some predictions are safe
enough. For example, the
thousands who graduate from
Imperial College every year will
mostly follow well-worn paths.
Some go to jobs, some stay on
for PhDs, while others will
leave with little or no idea of
what to do next: "I'll go home, I
expect and try to get some temp
job to clear my debts. After that,
Sir
•r Ronald
in jgff points to
interdisciplinary research such
as biomedical science, environ-
mental science and information
technology as essential areas for
Imperial College if it is to stay
at the cutting edge.
He foresees chemistry,
physics and engineering as hav-
ing important applications in
biomedical research. In effect,
the life sciences will become
increasingly shaped by the
'hard' sciences.

Schools. This
would mean that
medical students
would receive their pre-
clinical training in the new
Biomedical Centre. This
would produce doctors with a
"peculiarly Imperial flavour,"
according to Sir Ronald. The
new building would fill the gap
between the old and new chem-
istry buildings. Assuming the
required funding is obtained,
medical students may arrive at
the South Kensington site
before the end of the century.

Stronger links for departments
involved in environmental
research at the College along
with greater attention to infor-
mation technology are also pri-
orities for the future.
