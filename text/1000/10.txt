Felix 1000th Edition
Looking Back Over 80 Years
Of Clubs and Societies
Wei Lee
and Juliette
Decock look
at how the
clubs and
societies of
Imperial
College
Union have
changed
since 1911.
In you're first week of college
you are bombarded by hundreds
of opportunities to join various
clubs. Getting lost and confused
in the number of clubs and soci-
eties at Imperial College is
quite easy and if you try to
understand the structure it gets
worse! Clubs, committees,
sub-committees, we've tried to
unravel them, look at their ori-
gins and how they've evolved
since their formation.
Imperial College Union was
born in the autumn term of
1911 with Sir Arthur Acland as
its father. The idea was to pro-
vide the students from the three
constituent colleges (City &
Guilds, Royal College Of
Science and Royal School Of
Mines) with a club based along
the lines of the unions at
Oxford and Cambridge
Universities.
The main objectives of the
clubs of Imperial College Union
were to unite more closely the
students from the constituent
colleges and to help secure a
reputation for Imperial College
parallel to the standard of the
academic one.
The ten years following the
creation of the Union saw the
appearance of approximately a
dozen clubs which still remain
today. These include traditional
sporting clubs such as the
Association Football Club,
Lawn Tennis Club and the Boat
Club which started just after the
First World War. Other sporting
clubs that existed in the twen-
ties are the Golf Association,
Swimming Club, Badminton
Club and the Rugby Football
Club.
Sport was not the only inter-
est at the time, as shown by the
existence of the Chess Club,
Christian Union and the Wine
Tasting Society, which is
notable for having met in the
same place (the Union Dining
Hall) for over 70 years.
Some clubs no longer exist
in their original form but have
was the springboard for the
rock band Queen, Brian May
having studied at Imperial
College.
The next major step was the
reforming of the existing clubs
into two committees, the
Athletics Clubs Committee and
the Social Clubs Committee.
One of the reason for this
change was to enable the
Athletics Club Committee to
award colours while the Social
split and given rise to various
daughter clubs. This is the case
of the Literary & Debating
Society which has split into the
Arts Appreciation Society and
the Debating Society. The
Musical & Dramatic Society
has given rise to a number of
clubs. Amongst these are the
Dramatic Society, Choir,
Symphony Orchestra and the
Jazz and Rock Club. The latter
Clubs Committee could not.
(Colours are awards for ser-
vices beyond the call of duty to
a particular body of people
within the Union.) This reason
was soon forgotten as all com-
mittees now award colours.
As the number of clubs with-
in the Union increased, the
Recreational Clubs Committee
separated from the Social Clubs
Committee.
