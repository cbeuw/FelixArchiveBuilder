Felix 1000th Edition
Buildings and Bombshells
The new decade started with an
unfortunate turn for Imperial
College (IC). Winds of over 100
miles an hour on 25th January
1990 caused an estimated
£10,000 worth of damage to
College buildings.
Tizard Hall was hit by
tragedy on 9th June when a
student died after falling from
the top floor of the building.
Over the summer, the
Clayponds site in South Ealing
was purchased by College to
provide accommodation for 405
students. The development was
expected to cost around £11
million, to be partially funded by
the sale of Montpelier Hall.
The Government was rocked
in November by the resignation
of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher on 22nd November,
after controversy within the
Conservative party over her
leadership. She was succeeded
by the Chancellor John Major
on 28th November.
Also this year, the elected
Felix Editor & Print Unit
Manager Chris Stapleton was
unable to take up his sabbatical
post after failing his exams (he
later re-took the year). He was
appointed to the temporary
Union staff post of Print Unit
Production Manager. Andy
Butcher was elected as a non-
sabbatical Felix Editor in the
ballot in early December. A stu-
dent referendum held at the
same time rejected the idea of
extending the College Day to
9am-6pm. The idea was
proposed by a College Working
Party chaired by Professor Alan
Swanson. It was later accepted
as College policy.
A new centre for Population
Biology at Silwood Park was
opened by Margaret Thatcher
on 9th January 1991. Later in
the month, the Rector
announced plans for a new
science park in South Wales.
The project, located in Newport,
was developed jointly by
Imperial College, the Welsh
Development Agency and
Newport Borough Council. The
first phase involved the building
of a £2 million technology
centre, 'Imperial House'.
After the start of Operation
1990-
Imperial College students protest against the Gulf War
'Desert Storm' in Kuwait on
16th January, an Iraqi student at
IC was given 28 days notice by
the Home Office to leave the
country (20th February).
Imperial College stated their full
support for the student's appeal.
The Government scrapped
the Poll Tax on 8th March after
national campaigns against it.
Britain's first astronaut, Helen
Sharman, joined Russian astro-
nauts in the MIR space station
on 19th May.
On 18th October, a student
was seriously injured during an
attempt to stop a mascot from
being stolen during a mascotry
raid. He underwent two opera-
tions on his leg after being run
over by a van that was driving
away with the mascot.
Issue 924 of Felix was stolen
by members of the cast of the
joint DramSoc and OpSoc
production 'Grease' (31st
January 1992). 3,500 copies
were removed from departments
soon after they had been deliv-
ered. The culprits felt that a
review of the production in that
issue could have damaged ticket
sales. Union President Zoe
Hellinger admitted she was
partly responsible.
A rally in London protesting
at student debt organised by the
National Union of Students
(NUS) on 12th February
attracted 25,000 students.
There were rumours in June
of a serious split in the College
management over the possibility
of buying Furse House, the
former Ministry of Defence
Hostel on Queen's Gate
Terrace. The College would
have needed £3 million to buy
the building, which would be
used for student accommoda-
tion. Felix reported the
existence of a discussion
document on demolishing
Southside halls to make way for
a conference centre (issue 938).
Plans for Imperial College to
become a 'medical super-
school' were revealed in
October. On 11th December,
two female students were
assaulted and attacked by five
men outside the Huxley build-
ing on Queensgate.
Felix was the first to reveal
