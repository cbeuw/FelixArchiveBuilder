Felix 1000th Edition
Changing Careers Of Graduates
Director of
the Careers
Service, John
Simpson,
writes about
how the
destinations
of Imperial
College
graduates
has changed.
When Felix was in its early
years, fewer than 5% of 18 year
olds went to University; this
figure is now approaching 30%.
Other significant changes over
the last 40 years include the
increase in the number of
female, overseas and mature
students, the increase in the
number of graduates under-
taking postgraduate and
research courses and an increase
in the number of students from
ethnic minorities.
The destinations of graduates
has also changed with the move
towards commerce and away
from industry. There has also
been a decline in both opportu-
nities and interest in teaching
and the public service.
Unemployment has fluctuated
over the last 40 years, reaching
peaks in the early years of each
decade.
The Decline of Employment in
Industry
In the 50s and 60s, graduates in
engineering and science began
in careers related to their degree
subjects. A l l this started to
change in the early 70s. With
industry suffering from the
recession, accountants realised
that there were graduates
looking for alternative careers.
The recession in the early 80s
accelerated the move to
commerce with the result that,
since 1972, the percentage of
graduates entering commerce
has increased from 17% to 32%.
In the same period, those enter-
ing industry fell from 32% to
23%. Public service also
suffered a decline but education
remained reasonably stable. The
box below illustrates the trends
at the start of each decade for
the last thirty years.

1986-87 6.2
1991-92 11.6
A feature of the 50s and 60s was
very low graduate unemploy-
ment, with figures of less than
5%. We consider unemployment
to be bad in the early 90s, but a
glance at the figures above
shows the extent that unemploy-
ment has fluctuated since the
mid 70s.
One interesting fact is that
women have consistently
experienced lower rates of
unemployment than men.
Teacher Training
In the mid 70s teacher training
was still popular, but the actual
numbers choosing this option
fell steadily from 5,946 in 1977
to 2,355 at the height of the
yuppie boom in 1989. They
have only crept up to 3,789 in
1992. One can understand the
concern of the Government as
they try to persuade more scien-
tists to take up teaching. One
incentive they are operating is
the award of bursaries in
subjects with a shortage of
students.
Further Academic Study
Those following further acade-
mic study in the U K totalled
6,229 in 1977 and remained
stable until 1990 when the total
reached 7,223. B y 1992 the
numbers had increased sharply
to 10,287.
This is partly a reflection of
the difficult job market, but it is
also a recognition that a post-
graduate qualification can be a
help in starting some careers.
Unemployment rates for post-
graduates have been lower than
the rates for graduates.
