Felix was born in an era that
saw the first green shoots of
student rebellion and it very
quickly showed that it was not
going to be left out of the
proceedings.
Anarchy reigned in the very
first issue (9th December 1949)
with a scathing attack on the
police for breaking up students'
Guy Fawkes Night celebrations.
The police hosed both the
bonfire and the assembled
students and in the ensuing
chaos they arrested 16 people.
Readers were asked to "dig
Consort statue to discolour the
light. Several sets of antlers had
also been removed from stuffed
animal heads on the walls of a
dining hall and replaced with
bicycle handlebars. The club
was renamed '28V2' and a funeral
was held in Silwood Park.
In the annual Morphy Day
boat race competitions in
November, the Royal College of
Science won the Lowry Cup for
the first time since 1948.
Issue 60 (March 1954)
congratulated students on the
statistic that more debaggings
The RCS crew won the Lowry Cup on Morphy Day, 1953
deep" to help pay their fines.
In the outside world, the
British Government officially
recognised the Communist state
of China (9th January 1950) and
Foreign Office officials Guy
Burgess and Donald Maclean
defected to Russia (May 1951).
The Suez Crisis began to
develop as British/Egyptian
relations worsened.
The National Union of
Students (NUS) removed itself
from the International Union of
Students in November 1952
after failure to confirm it would
not have to be involved in the
political side of the organisation.
A University of London
debate on 6th February 1953
recommended the legalisation
of abortion. This was also the
year when Derek Bentley was
hanged, despite 200 MPs plead-
ing for a reprieve.
July saw the death of the
infamous '29 Club', a group of
practical jokers responsible for
putting coloured paper all over
the lamps in front of the Prince
(removal of someone's trousers)
per person per hour took place
in the previous week than ever
before. On 6th May, Dr Roger
Bannister ran the first sub-four
minute mile at the Iffley Road
track in Oxford.
On 3rd March 1955, the
Queen Mother was elected
Chancellor of the University of
London. Frank Irving and Lome
Welch of the Imperial College
Gliding Club made the first
two-seater glider flight across
the English Channel on 14th
May, landing in Belgium after a
flight of 250 miles.
The first commercial televi-
sion broadcast took place on
22nd September, prompting the
B B C into scheduling the death
of Grace Archer in 'The
Archers' radio serial as a
counter-attraction.
A second year Physics
student jumped from the second
floor of the Royal College of
Science on 9th December. He
announced: " A friend of mine
was handing out fags down
there and I wanted a smoke, so I
jumped."
February 1956 ended with
the NUS organising a house to
house collection to raise
£30,000 for a new student hostel
in London. Issue 87 reported the
impending demolition of the
Imperial Institute to make way
for the expansion of College.
Internationally, the Suez Crisis
reached its conclusion towards
the end of the year.
Weeks Hall was paid for by
Vickers Ltd in March 1957 at a
cost of £150,000. The Jubilee of
Imperial College's Charter was
celebrated by a visit from the
Queen Mother on 28th May.
The Wolfenden Report was
published on 4th September,
recommending the legalisation
of homosexual acts between
adults in private. The Jodrell
Bank radio telescope came into
operation on 11th October.
The future of the Queen's
Tower, part of the soon-to-be
demolished Imperial Institute,
was under speculation at the
start of 1958. A n ex-Imperial
College geologist, Dr John
Stephenson, reached the South
Pole with the Commonwealth
Trans-Antarctic expedition in
January. Christopher Cockerell's
newly-invented hovercraft was
patented on 23rd May.
Controversy surrounded
Imperial College's arts maga-
zine Phoenix in February 1959.
Its editor, David Irving, was
dismissed by the Students
Union at a packed Union
Meeting for "his unwillingness
to cooperate with the Board of
Directors". He was later
appointed editor of the
Carnival Times, a rag maga-
zine organised by U L U .
The Haldane Library was
officially opened at 13 Princes
Gardens on 8th May. A Union
Meeting in December voted to
boycott all goods from the
Union of South Africa. The first
hovercraft Channel crossing
took place on 25th July. Post
codes were used for the first
time in Norwich on 3rd
October. On 6th November,
two motorists were killed in an
accident on the M l , which
opened earlier that week.
