Catastrophe On The Eve Of
Felix's 1000thEdition
BY OUR NEWS STAFF
On the eve of the publication of Felix
1000, disaster struck the Imperial College
Union Print Unit. The litho, which is used
to print Felix every week, broke down at
around midday yesterday.
Felix 1000 was due to be produced in
two parts: a normal Felix (containing
news, reviews, letters and articles) and a
special 1000th Edition Supplement. By the
time the litho broke down, the supplement
had been printed, but only a third of the
normal Felix had been completed.
The printer, Andy Thompson, attempted
to repair the litho in order for the printing
to continue but, despite his extensive
printing experience, he was forced to call
the maintenance engineer.
The engineer was unable to assess the
situation until early this morning and Mr
Thompson was unsure, at the time of
writing, if the litho was immediately
repairable. Even if it could be repaired
within a couple of hours, this would still
be too late for Felix 1000 to be completed
in time to be distributed with the
Supplement. In order to explain the
situation, this flyer was photocopied late
on Thursday evening.
It is hoped that the litho will be
functioning again in time for printing Felix
next week. Any articles submitted for
today's issue will be carried forward to
next week.
The Felix staff would like to apologise
for any inconvenience caused and hope
that you enjoy reading the Supplement.
Felix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College
Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB (Tel: 071 225 8672).
