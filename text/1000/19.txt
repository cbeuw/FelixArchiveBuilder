Felix 1000th Edition
The Arts to indicate that it was
to become the metropolitan
centre of a whole group of insti-
tutions for practical science to
be established throughout the
country.
In 1863, the Government
School Of Mines was renamed
the Royal School Of Mines in an
attempt to re-establish its own
identity amidst the merging
faculties. However, following a
report on scientific instruction
by a Select Committee to the
House of Commons, a Royal
Commission was set up in 1870
to investigate the education and
advancement of science. This
Commission recommended that
the Royal School Of Mines be
moved to South Kensington,
where it would be consolidated
with the Royal College Of
Chemistry.
On the new site, laboratories
were provided for practical
instruction in physics and biology
(hitherto entirely lacking); a
Chair of Mathematics was
established and the School was
to be made available for the
instruction of science teachers.
The South Kensington site
was chosen because the
Government had acquired
twelve acres of land there, from
the Commissioners of the 1851
Exhibition, for use by the
Science and Art Department. At
the time, the site was a waste-
land of sheds and temporary
buildings except for one build-
ing of curious design on
Exhibition Road. It was said to
have been erected for the Royal
School Of Naval Architecture,
but the School chose alternative
premises at Greenwich in 1873.
In any case, the building (known
then as the Huxley Building)
was quickly occupied by depart-
ments of the Royal College of
Science.
By moving into larger
premises, it was possible for the
departments to expand. This had
not been possible at Jermyn
Street and Hanover Square.
City & Guilds College
In 1878, the City & Guilds Of
London Institute For The
Advancement Of Technical
Education was created. In the
following year, classes in chem-
istry and physics were instituted
at temporary quarters in Cowper
Street School, Finsbury. From
this grew the Finsbury
Technical College which
opened in 1883. The Institute's
chief aim was realised when it
founded the Central Technical
College Of The London Institute
on Exhibition Road in 1884.
The College's function gradually
narrowed to the teaching of
engineering and in 1873 its title
was changed to the City &
Guilds College.
Imperial College
So, by the turn of the century
there existed on the South
Kensington site, three separate
colleges covering between them
the whole field of pure and
applied science. Inevitably,
through overlapping subjects,
the three institutions worked
closely together and on 8th July
1907, Imperial College Of
Science and Technology was
established by Royal Charter.
City & Guilds College took a
little longer to be incorporated
into Imperial College, but by
1910 all three were linked and,
as a whole, were established as
a School of the University Of
London.
The Imperial Institute
To commemorate Queen
Victoria's Jubilee, the Prince of
Wales (later King Edward VII)
had proposed the Imperial
Institute in the summer of 1886.

intended as a museum and
exhibition centre dealing with
Indian and other colonial affairs,
encouraging emigration and
expanding trade.
Since it was true to Prince
Albert's aspirations for the
South Kensington site, the
Institute was advocated by
Queen Victoria. The architect
T.E. Coflcutt designed a grand
series of neo-renaissance build-
ings stretching over 200 metres
and bridging three towers. It
was built on the site of the for-
mer gardens of the Royal
Horticultural Society. The central
