Felix 1000th Edition
A Week In The
Life Of...
Felix
Felix comes out every Friday during term time. An
elected sabbatical officer edits the magazine. Its pro-
duction, however, is still dependant on help from the
student sub-editors and contributors. In the space of
a week Felix has to be planned, written and printed.
Friday is the deadline for articles although con-
tributors frequently operate their own timetables.
Sub-editors begin to arrange previews of films,
plays, books and music all of which form an integral
part of the paper.
Articles are written and reviews are typed in on
Monday and Tuesday. Sub-editors lay out their
pages and decide on the photographs they will need.
The pages are then proofed and corrected. A dedicat-
ed group of photographers take, develop and print
many of the photos in our own darkroom.
