Felix 1000th Edition
An artist's impression of the Imperial College Union Building in the 1930s.
Throughout the years more
clubs started, reflecting the
broadening interests of the
students. These included the
Gliding Club (1930), Sailing
Club (1949), Billiards Club,
Film Society, Jewish Society
(1951) and the Underwater Club
(1957).
The seventies saw a boost in
the formation of clubs. This
gave rise to the formation of the
Social & Cultural Amusement
Board in 1973 which grouped
together all the 'performing'
clubs. Soon to follow was the
Publications Board in 1976 due
to the increasing interest in
media clubs. After Felix, which
began in 1949, S.T.O.I.C (the
Student Television Of Imperial
College) started in 1969. I.C.
Radio was formed at about the
same time, but they only got a
licence to broadcast on medium
wave in December 1978.
The last committee to emerge
was the Overseas Students
Committee, at the beginning of
the eighties. This reflected the
growth and importance that
Overseas societies were begin-
ning to have within the Union.
In the past 15 years Imperial
College has seen a considerable
number of changes among the
style of its clubs. The 'traditional
clubs' still exist, but the main
changes have occurred in the
recreational and social clubs.
The Tiddlywinks Society
disappeared at the end of the
seventies. The practice of this
'sport' is now restricted to the
length of Oxford Street on the
second Saturday of the autumn
term - one of Rag's most popu-
lar events.
The Croquet Club, which
used to play on Queen's Lawn,
only existed during the seventies.
1975 saw the beginning of the
Pimlico Connection Society. It
is within Imperial College that
the scheme itself was formed
and it has now spread to many
other universities around the
country. 1976 saw the beginning
of completely different type of
club: the Wargame Society.
In the eighties, the advance in
technology led to the emergence
of the Micro-computer and
Science Fiction Societies.
Social changes also led to
new societies like the PATA (or
Pro-life) Society, United
Nations Society, Third World
First Society, C N D Society
(which stopped in the early
nineties) and the Vegetarian
Society (VegSoc). It is
rumoured that VegSoc ceased to
meet after a group of people
became members and held a
barbecue on behalf of the society
in Beit Quad!
New sports societies include
the Parachute Club, the Fitness
Club and the Wing Chun Club.
On the other hand, the eighties
saw the end of some of the old
societies like the Astronomical
Society, Railway Club and the
Transcendental Meditation
Society (which reformed at the
start of this year). The Graffiti
Club and H G Wells Society
lasted slightly longer but both
died out in the late eighties.
New born clubs included
Splot Soc (a paintballing
society), the Computer Graphic
Society and the Science &
Ethics Society.
At the beginning of this
academic year there were 122
Union clubs and societies listed
in the Imperial College Union
Handbook. Bearing in mind that
there are also numerous clubs
within each of the four
Constituent College Unions, it
looks as though Imperial
College students are not as
apathetic as some people claim.
The Constituent College
Union societies tend to have a
more academic nature. Some of
these were originally Imperial
College Union societies which
reformed under a Constituent
College Union. This is the case
with the Astronomical Society
which is now a Royal College
Of Science society.
Currently Imperial College
Union spends more money per
student on its clubs and societies
than any other University's
Union in Britain. What the
future holds for all the societies
within Imperial College Union
is dependant on the funding that
can be allocated as well as the
motivation, interests and enthu-
siasm its students.
