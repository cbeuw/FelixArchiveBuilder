A Brief History Of Imperial College
Imperial
College is
87 years old
this year.
Simon Shaw
explains its
short but
complex
history.
Below: The proposed Union
Building. Today it forms the
north side of Beit Quad.
With the prospect of Albertopolis
looming large over South
Kensington, attention has been
focused on the area's architec-
ture. You do not have to have
both eyes open to notice that
most of Imperial College sticks
out like a sore thumb. But has it
always been such an eyesore?
Imperial College was offi-
cially established by Royal
Charter in 1907 but its complex
history can be traced back
another half century. Complex
in that its birth was preceded by
no fewer than ten name-changes
and almost as many changes of
premises.
The present site in South
Kensington is owned by the
Royal Commission For The
Great Exhibition Of 1851. It
was purchased as part of Prince
Albert's plan for the develop-
ment of South Kensington as a
centre for education in art and
science.
The Prince was also chiefly
responsible for the three national
museums (the Science Museum,
Natural History Museum and
Victoria & Albert Museum)
being situated in such close
vicinity. Most of the College's
departments, however, originated
elsewhere and gradually accu-
mulated at the South Kensington
site between 1872 and 1891.
The Origin Of The
Royal School Of Mines
Imperial College has always
been a union of constituent col-
leges. The oldest, the Royal
School Of Mines, can be traced
back to the Museum Of
Economic Geology which
opened in 1841 in a house in
Craig's Court SW1, adjoining
the old Scotland Yard. From the
outset, it enrolled a limited
number of pupils but its teach-
ing function expanded when it
moved to Jermyn Street in 1851.
There it offered courses in
mining and applied sciences. At
this new location, it was reopened
as the Museum Of Practical
Geology. Its founder, Henry De
La Beche, went on to establish
the Government School Of
Mines And Of Science Applied
To The Arts later in that year.
This new school was staffed by
a group of eminent scientists
and held courses relating to all
theoretical and practical areas of
mining and geology.
The Origin Of The
Royal College Of Science
The Chemistry Department of
the Royal College Of Science
traces its descent from another
foundation. The College Of
Chemistry was founded in
October 1845 and from
December of that year, with
Queen Victoria's consent, it
became known as the Royal
College Of Chemistry. It sought
new premises at 16 Hanover
Square which had an impressive
frontage on Oxford Street.
A Marriage Of Sorts
In 1853, the Royal College Of
Chemistry became part of the
Government School Of Mines
And Of Science Applied To The
Arts in a bid to solve its finan-
cial problems. As a result,
students on the mining school
course found themselves sharing
the laboratories at Hanover
Square with chemistry students.
It was hoped that the School
would broaden its educational
scope and in the same year yet
another name change was insti-
gated. It was now to be known
as the Metropolitan School Of
Science Applied To Mining And
