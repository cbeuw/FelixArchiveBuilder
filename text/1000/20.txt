tower, Queen's Tower, was 87
metres tall, had a copper dome
and held a peal of ten bells
donated by a Mrs Millar from
Melbourne. At the time it was
built, it was one of the tallest
buildings in London.
The Imperial Institute opened
on 10th May 1893 but gradually
lost significance as an icon of
the British Empire in the 20th
Century. However, its proposed
demolition as part of Imperial
College's expansion programme
(1957-65) provoked opposition
from the general public.
A letter to The Times in
February 1956 began: "It is no
crime, in itself, to replace an old
building by a new one. It
becomes a crime only when a
good old building is replaced by
a bad new one."
It went on to explain the
dilemma: "If the Imperial
College is to play, in London,
the role chosen for it as a great
scientific and technological
centre, the area now occupied
by the Imperial Institute and its
adjacent buildings will be
required." As a compromise, the
Queen's Tower (then known as
Collcutt's Tower) was left
standing, requiring substantial
reinforcements to keep it erect.
The Imperial Institute, meanwhile,
became the Commonwealth
Institute and moved to Holland
Park in 1962.
The Expansion Programme
It was the aforementioned
expansion program which has
moulded the College into what
we see today. Imperial College
was accepting more and more
students and was hungry for
extra space. Comment in issue
87 of Felix stated that if the
opponents to the expansion
scheme "went behind this
facade that faces the Royal
College Of Science they would
realise that the fire hazard in the
draughty wooden corridors and
the galvanised tin roof makes a
mockery of the wedding cake
frontage."
Few original buildings now
remain in their entirety: the City
& Guilds College was demol-
ished, the Chemistry Department
was rebuilt and nearly all depart-
ments other than the Royal
School Of Mines were given new
premises. The Huxley Building
on Exhibition Road was aban-
doned and a 'new' Huxley
Building was erected in 1975 on
Queen's Gate. The old building
is now the Henry Cole Wing of
the Victoria & Albert Museum.
Referring to the changes to
Beit Quad, issue 79 of Felix
reported that "Beit Quadrangle
will be laid out as a semi-formal
garden with grass lawns and
York stone paths and some cen-
tral feature which may be a
fountain. The tennis club have
received extra courts at Harling-
ton as compensation for the loss
of its old courts on this site."
The picture of today's
Imperial College is completed
by the addition of St Mary's
Hospital Medical School. St
Mary's Hospital was founded at
Paddington and enrolled its first
two students in 1851. The
Medical School, founded in 1854,
became part of the University
Of London in 1900. In 1988 it
merged with Imperial College
adding another discipline to the
College's name which became
Imperial College Of Science,
Technology And Medicine.
The Imperial Institute1
is clearly visible in the centre of the photograph. Across Imperial Institute Road (now Imperial College Road) are
the Chemistry and Physics Departments2
of the Royal College of Science. Perhaps the only recognisable College buildings are those in Beit
Quad3
. The Union Building4
, however, has yet to receive its two uppermost floors. The former Huxley Building5
is just visible opposite the
Science Museum and the City & Guilds College6
stills stands on Exhibition Road.
