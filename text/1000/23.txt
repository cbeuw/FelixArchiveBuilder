Imperial College
Imperial College experience has
mirrored much of what has been
going on in other Universities,
but it has also reflected the
uniqueness of Imperial College
and of London.
In the 50s and 60s, Imperial
College was a very male domi-
nated institution. This is not
surprising when statistics show
that nationally only 37 women
graduated with an engineering
degree in 1962 compared with
2,539 men. The numbers of
women at Imperial College have
increased significantly since
then to the present total of 26%.
London has always attracted
large numbers of overseas
students and Imperial College
has certainly benefited from
this, especially in respect of
postgraduates. Similarly, large
numbers of ethnic minority
students wish to study in
London and many choose to
come to Imperial College.
Imperial College has not
attracted large numbers of
mature students. The reasons for
this are debatable, but probably
reflect the high entry standards
demanded for all the courses.
Employers from industry
have targeted Imperial College
for many years for the high
quality of our technical gradu-
ates. Accountants and other City
employers soon recognised that
Imperial College graduates had
the skills needed in the financial
services industry. As a result,
about 20% of Imperial College
first degree graduates entering
UK employment went into this
line of work.
The high reputation of our
research has encouraged above
average numbers of Imperial
College graduates to stay on to
do research.

Future Careers
Today's graduates will experi-
ence many changes in their
careers. You cannot expect to
join an employer and have a
secure career for the rest of your
working life. You must equip
yourself with the skills to
change and to develop through-
out your career, both technically
and personally.
Continuing professional

welcome to make use of the
Careers Service at any time. It is
