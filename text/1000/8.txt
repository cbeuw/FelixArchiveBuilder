1984 proved to be a year full of
problems for student residences.
On 2nd March, Felix reported
that Southside may have to be
closed following a fire inspec-
tion by the Greater London
Council. Later in the year,
residents were in uproar over
fire alarms regularly going off
during the exam period in June.
On 4th April, bailiffs were
called in to evict anti-nuclear
protesters from Greenham
Common. In November, 50
students set up a squat in
University College London
buildings in protest at the lack
of student accommodation.
They were presented with a
same month, City & Guilds
College Union held a Union
General Meeting (UGM) in the
second carriage of a Circle Line
underground train after being
left without a room to hold their
meeting in.
1986 began with students
boycotting lectures, labs and
tutorials on 15th January in
support of a strike called by the
Association of University
Teachers protesting at cuts in
funding. In February, the
College was awarded £850,000
in damages by the High Court
for design deficiencies by the
architects who built the
Electrical Engineering building.
Student housing was beset by problems in the 1980s.
possession order but refused to
leave.
On 18th January 1985 Felix
reported that student houses in
Evelyn Gardens would be
closed to carry out repairs
costing £250,000 after all six
halls were found to be in contra-
vention of the Housing Act. The
College Estates division decided
to evacuate Willis Jackson
house for repairs, but reversed
the decision on 15th February
following a request from
Imperial College Union (ICU)
that the work be carried out
during a vacation. Riots at the
Heysel football stadium on 29th
May killed 41 supporters. At the
start of the new academic year,
I C U entered into discussions
with College management with
the idea to take control of the
running of the Union Bar. In the
The Chernobyl nuclear
reactor in the USSR exploded
on 26th April.
Felix reported the possibility
of a merger between the College
and St Mary's Hospital Medical
School in May, when a working
party was set up to discuss it.
On 31st July the Biochemistry
building was flooded. Four fire
engines were needed to pump
the water out. The M25 was
completed on 29th October.
Near the end of the year, ICU
began to press College adminis-
tration for control of the QT
Snack Bar in the JCR because
its profits were not benefiting
students. A student boycott of
QT in January 1987 forced it to
close. Terry Waite was abducted
in Beirut while negotiating for
the release of other hostages on
20th January.
ICU gained control of profits
from gravel extraction at the
Harlington Sports Ground from
the College on 15th September.
The money was given to an
independent trust which invested
money on the Union's behalf.
Four student rooms in
Lexham Gardens were declared
to be too small for occupation
by a Borough Environmental
Health Officer on 18th January
1988. February proved to be a
more humourous month with
I C U President Ian Howgate
changing his name by deed poll
to Sidney Harbour-Bridge to
raise money for Comic Relief.
That summer, the College
announced its plans to convert
the main house at Silwood Park
into a conference centre amidst
protests from postgraduate
students there. On 6th July, an
explosion on the North Sea oil
rig Piper Alpha killed 150 men.
A report in Felix on 8th
September told of the College's
purchase of Olave House, a new
student residence in Earls Court.
In October, residents in Fisher
Hall decided to hold a rent
protest after the College failed
to tell them about rent increases
before they moved in. October
was also the month in which the
Secretary of State for Education
Kenneth Baker announced plans
to introduce loans to 'top up'
students' grants.
Student politics dominated
the headlines in 1989 with a
lobby of Parliament by I C U
over student loans in January.
A U G M on 31st January 1989
defeated by 150 votes an
attempt by the Union Council to
abolish UGMs.
A death sentence was
imposed by the Ayatollah
Khomeini on author Salman
Rushdie on 14th February. His
book, 'The Satanic Verses' was
regarded as insulting to the
Islamic faith.
Later in the year, the Union
took measures to minimise the
disruption caused by a tube
strike during the exam period.
This included setting up a
minibus service and the arrange-
ment of alternative sleeping
accommodation within College.
