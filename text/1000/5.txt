Felix 1000th Edition
That Was The World That Was
The 1960s was a decade of
indecision over Imperial
College's relationship with the
National Union of Students
(NUS). After cutting its ties
with the national body in 1948,
Imperial College Union (ICU)
again voted not to re-affiliate.
The decision was made on a
majority of seven votes at a
Union Meeting on 3rd May
1960.
That summer, the Anderson
report on student funding rec-
ommended the abolition of State
Scholarships. The new Physics
block was opened on 20th
October by Sir John Cockroft.
This was the same day that the
trial of Penguin Books (for pub-
lishing D H Lawrence's Lady
Chatterley's Lover) began. The
company was acquitted of an
obscenity charge on 2nd
November.
9th April 1961 saw the Cross
Country Club complete a
Land's End to John O'Groats
relay in 99 hours 14 minutes.
Britain's first satellite, Ariel,
was launched from Cape
Canaveral in America on 26th
April 1962. Felix began to be
printed internally in June. This
was in order to halve the cost of
printing - Felix was losing £250
a year at the time. The printing
equipment was donated to the
Union by the College
Governing Body. As part of the
expansion of Imperial College,
Imperial Institute Road was
permanently closed on 22nd
October. The satirical television
programme 'That Was The
Week That Was' (TW3) was
first broadcast on 24th
November.
The debate on NUS affilia-
tion continued during the early
part of 1963. A Union Meeting
on 7th February voted by a
majority of 16 to join the organ-
isation, but this was overturned
at an Extraordinary General
Meeting on 7th March by a
majority of 61 votes. The first
students moved into Falmouth
and Tizard halls of residence on
11th May.
In the outside world, M P
John Profumo resigned from the
Government on 5th June after a
scandal. The Criminal Justice
1960-
1967
The Sports Centre under construction in 1967
Act came into force on lst
August, raising the minimum
prison age to 17. The Great
Train Robbery took place on 8th
August. Approximately £2.5
million was stolen from the
Glasgow to London mail train.
Technology became a major
focus of coverage in 1964 as
B B C 2 began transmission on
16th April and it was announced
on 6th May that Imperial
College was being given an
I B M 7090 computer. The first
British space flight (of the 'Blue
Streak' rocket) took place on
5th June. In November, the
Board of Studies decided on
regulations to keep Wednesday
afternoons free for R C S
students to allow them to take
part in sports. The rules were
implemented the following year.
In 1965, the Royal School of
Mines Union changed their mas-
cot from a 'Michelin man' to a
three foot model of a Davy lamp
(18th May). The University of
London nuclear reactor was
opened at Silwood Park on 22nd
June.
Students were shocked in
October as the accounts of
London Students' Carnival Ltd,
a rag organisation, showed it
had not given any money to
charity in the previous year due,
in part, to administration costs.
The month ended with
Parliament abolishing the death
penalty for murder for an exper-
imental five year period.
1966 began with the casting
of Mike the Micrometer,
Imperial College's new mascot.
The Rag Carnival Board

the news that Chelsea police

tions during the Carnival in 1960 •
