Felix produced a special issue in
January 1968 which reported
the purchase of 54-56 Evelyn
Gardens by College for student
accommodation.
Less than a fortnight later, a
fire in a Falmouth Hall room
caused Felix to call the Hall's
fire precautions into question.
The fire had been quickly and
enthusiastically put out using
extinguishers by several fire
fighters who then proceeded to
dispose of furniture and various
other articles through a
window. Rather than evac-
uating the area, a crowd of
sightseers gathered on the
staircase to watch.
In March, 2,500 students
attended a National Union
of Students (NUS) rally in
Trafalgar Square in protest
at the Government cutting
student grants. The Royal
Commission on Medical
Education recommended a
medical faculty for
Imperial College in a report
published in April. After
American civil rights
campaigner Martin Luther
King was shot on 4th April,
James Earl Ray was arrested
for his murder at Heathrow
Airport on 8th June.
The Sports Centre
opened in early October,
but was beset by several
cases of vandalism within a
week of it opening. At the
end of the month, Morphy
Day was marred by two people
being seriously injured in fights.
Imperial College launched a
public appeal on 9th January
1969 for £2 million to pay for
student and staff accommodation.
Student militancy erupted in
February as the London School
of Economics temporarily
closed after internal problems in
its dealings with students' polit-
ical views. The militants, who
staged a sit-in at the University
of London Union in protest at
the closing, were condemned by
a meeting of the City & Guilds
College Union but supported by
a subsequent Union Meeting.
A referendum on the
Imperial College Union (ICU)
constitution held on 24th
February revealed that students
wanted top Union officials to be
elected by a campus-wide
ballot. ICU voted to rejoin the
NUS in early November in the
first Union Meeting to take
place in the Great Hall. The new
College block, including the
Sherfield Building and library,
was opened by the Queen in
November.
After eight years of negotia-
tions, the proposed merger
between Imperial College and the
Architectural Association was
'Davey', the RSMU mascot
abandoned (January 1970).
November was the month in
which the Government issued a
consultative document on the
financing of Student Unions. A
demonstration march against the
proposals in central London
attracted 20,000 students
(January 1971).
The Open University began
television broadcasts on 3rd
January. Decimal currency
came into operation nationally
on 15th February, 'Decimal
Day'. On 2nd December, the
House of Commons rejected a
move to retain British Summer
Time during the winter months.
The miners' strike began on
9th January 1972, causing wide-
spread disruption to industry.
Direct rule of Northern Ireland
was imposed on 30th March
after heightening violence. The
Murray Report, which was
published on 14th November,
recommended alterations to the
make-up of the University of
London, including forcing IC to
get its money from the
University and not directly from
Government.
Britain and the Irish Republic
formally became members of
the EEC on lst January 1973.
The first Union General
Meeting of the year (in
January) saw students
oppose direct action in the
form of a rent strike to
protest at Government
grant cuts. Felix 330 (27th
February) reported Union
Council plans to merge
Ents, DramSoc, FilmSoc,
OpSoc and the Folk and
Jazz Clubs into the Social
& Cultural Amusements
Board. A Refectory
Committee Meeting in
March was told that it
would cost £3,350 to clear
refectory areas of cock-
roaches and mice. The
Government introduced
Value Added Tax (VAT)
on lst April.
The Government finally
jjll gave way to pressure on the
SB inadequacy of student
• j grants in June 1974 and
announced a 25% increase.
The first McDonald's
hamburger restaurant
opened in London on lst
October. The IRA bombed two
Birmingham pubs on 7th
November killing 21 people and
injuring 120. Lord Lucan
disappeared on 11th November
after Sandra Rivett, Lady
Lucan's nanny, was murdered.
Two workers at Windscale
died from leukaemia on 10th
January 1975. At the end of the
month the City & Guilds
College Union, after stealing the
Royal School of Mines Union
mascot 'Davey', managed to
trick them into paying £50 for a
wooden replica.
IC Radio received an indica-
tion from the Home Office in
early November that they may
be granted test licence.
