ARE YOU A TEN-PIN
ADDICT?
. . . or a potential ten-pin addict?
Everyone especially ladies, is
welcome to join one of our
leagues. No previous experience
is necessary. One league is run
on Wednesday afternoons, and,
should the demand arise, an even-
ing league will be started.
We use the East Acton Bowling
(next to East Acton station on the
Central Line), who charge 2/- per
game. It is hoped that one third
of this price will be refunded to
members (fee 5/- per year, by the
Union, thus bringing the cost
down to 1/4 per game.
If you are interested, please
contact R. J. Kirlc. Physics 3, via
the Union or Physics racks.
A WARNING
TO THE OTHER CLUBS
If you have no receipt, then you can't claim
your money back. This was the lesson learned
by some 30 people who paid shilling subscriptions
last year to the Ten-Pin Bowling Club. Their
grouse is that under the first committee they saw
no goods for their money.
The club was only recognized by R C C in the
course of the last session. Consequently it did
not qualify for a grant and its committee were
not answerable to higher authority. So members
joined and paid their fees by " gentlemanly agree-
ment." The treasurer could not account for the
money he took.
Last term the club secretary called an annual
general meeting. None of the resting committee
attended, so the RCC chairman took the chair. A
completely new committee, the present one, was
elected.
THE PINS DROP
Under new management the recreation at last
began. No further subscriptions were taken, but
groups visited ten-pin bowls. As no proper
accounts had been kept by the first committee, the
new one could take no action.
The Ten-Pin Bowling Club is now under the
stringent ruling of RCC. With 60 members to
date, it now flourishes with regular bowling. Last
Wednesday it became affiliated to the British Ten
Pin Bowling Association.
cus
on Tapsoc
As a result of a recent article in Sennet, a
mysterious underground society has been formed
within I.C. Under the unofficial title of the
Telephone Tapping Society, at least twenty-seven
groups of burly telephone swindlers (each group
previously ignorant of the existence of the other
twenty-six) have banded together for the purpose
of swopping dialling codes, high-collared raincoats,
pennies and other essential equipment.
Information concerning this society is difficult
to obtain. But on questioning 120 of my closest
friends in an exclusive Felix survey I was shocked
to find that 95 per cent of them knew about the
illegal activities of the the other 5 per cent. What
decadence!
Apparently the society's main activity at present
is writing replies to the several thousand enquiries
from students at underprivileged colleges (Arts
students find it particularly difficult to get jobs in
GPO telephone exchanges). The compilation of a
complete list of telephone codes of the world in
one volume is being considered. But it appears
that far more urgent is the need to equip all our
Sennet reporters with the telephone codes to their
own hometowns. They're feeling pretty lonely at
the moment. . .

went by van, at the head of Der-
went Dale. A hot snack besides
the reservoir, and a hectic dash
ensued, back for \ \ hours in the
warmth of the Nag's Head,
Edale.
Five went to Holy Communion
on Sunday at Edale Church. But
the rest were aroused in time for
breakfast and a hike up Jacob's
Ladder to Kinderlow, along the
ridge to Edale Moor and back to
Edale along the Pennine Way.
