Few of the spectators will realise how much
hard training has been done by the College VIII's
this year. Since the beginning of term, members
of the Boat Club have been training five days a
week on top of rowing in the various I.C.B.C.
crews which must be kept going if I.C. are to
maintain their superiority in the University and
succeed in open competition. Both the Morphy
and the Lowry crews have been making the pil-
grimages to Putney before breakfast three times a
week, and also they have been circuit training twice
a week.
This is possible not only through the effort of
the crews but also the coaches, who quite volun-
tarily take on the task of guiding the crews to their
best possible performances in four weeks.
C & G. Morphy is coached by Jan Smulders
whose crews have won the past two and many
other Morphy races. The Lowry crew is coached
by Dr. K . Cugan who has been very successful
with his crews in the past. Both R.S.M. Morphy
and Lowry are coached by Charles Bristow, presi-
dent of the Boat Club, who always produces re-
markable results from the smallest college.
R.C.S. have two new coaches
this year in the persons of Dr. A .
Cameron and Geoff Pert. The for-
mer is better known in rowing
circles through his associations
with Cambridge University B.C.
and Pembroke B.C., Cambridge.
Geoff Pert has only recently
started coaching, but he has
rowed in the I.C. first VIII and
also gained his purple with U.L.
first VIII in their 1961 crew.
This year all the crews have re-
painted their oars to make them
identifiable.
At the moment the result of the
race is anyone's guess but an ex-
perienced observer has said C&G
by half a length. In all events it
should be a close race in the
Morphy. In the Lowry the race is
expected to develop into a struggle
between Guilds and Mines, but
R.C.S. have been in hiding and on
the day they could well produce
an unexpected turn of speed and
power which could confound their
critics.
Morphy Day, besides being the
occasion for a rag on the mud
flats of Putney, is the day on
which intercollegiate boat races
are rowed.

" Fives ? Whats that, a poor man's seven-a-side ?"
This is a stock question whenever this neglected sport is men-
tioned in conversation.
The answer, whether it be sketchy or enthusiastic, can do little
co bring out the excitement of the game.
Since few schools have fives courts, many sportsmen have never
heard of fives and are too satisfied with their repertoire of sports to
find out.
Yet, when played well, fives demands standards of fitness, intelli-
gence and sheer athletic ability to which few players of the cruder
sports ever rise. In spite of this, fives is also a game which can
be played with great enthusiasm and enjoyment by the newcomer to
the sport.
The Rugby Fives Club in the College has led a shaky existence
in its three years of life. This season, however, we have an encourag-
ing increase in membership, and, as well as building up two com-
petitive strings to fulfil our widening list of fixtures, weekly sessions
are booked at the Hampstead Fives and Squash Club for those who
play for simple enjoyment.
This is an expanding club and we hope it will continue to be so,
keeping this sport very much alive.
Rugby
Successful S t a r t
by M. TURNER
The Rugby Club has once
again made a very successful start
to the season. /The First XV, un-
beaten for three games without
conceding a try, lost a hard game
against Harlequins on Saturday,
24th October. The highlight of
the game was the team's refusal
to give in against superior indi-
vidual skill and a half-time deficit
of 8-0. A brilliant fight-back to
level the scores brought great
adulation from the few specta-
tors, only, alas, to see J. Young,
the ex-International and Oxford
Blue go over for a try that was
duly converted. This brought,
not capitulation from I.C., but
renewed effort; a few minutes
from time, a superb fifty-yard
passing movement ended in an
unconverted try by Mills.
Result: I.C. 11, Harlequins 13.
The Ex. First, A l and A2 XVs
all boast unbeaten records, the
A l X V , ably captained by R.
Seaborn, needing only eight
pokits from the third game to
reach the century.
The only failure in the " B "
sides so far this term was the de-
feat of P. Bowler's "International
All Star X V " to Grays Thurock,
8—^3. Mr. Bowler, however,
claims that his arch-enemy,
Reich, made unsportsmanlike ad-
vances to the referee.

Badminton
Good Prospects
This season the Badminton
Club has introduced another
men's team into the University
League. The club now runs six
teams in all; two men's teams in
the first division, two in the
second division, a mixed, and a
ladies' team. This will give all
club members a reasonable
chance ofj. playing in matches.
The men's first team Opened its
fixtures with a good win over
Goldsmiths, one of the strongest
teams in the League. The score
of 7—2 was rather flattering to
I.C., and had Lee Kin Tat not
played the match might have
been lost. The prospects now of
retaining the League Champion-
ship for the fourth year running
are good. Although no Freshers
play in the first team at the mo-
ment, the promising play of R.
Milward, D. Howarth and I.
Blair has certainly created
healthy competition for first team
places.
