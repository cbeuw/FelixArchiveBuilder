UNION CLERK ?
Where is the famous Union
Clerk? . . . Non existent!
The Union Executive have ap-
parently decided that there is no
need for one at present !! This
is not true.
The clerk would type letters for
clubs and societies, Gestetner
circulars for them and generally
take the drudgery out of running a
club. She would also be able to
type copy for Felix and other col-
lege publications and relieve over-
worked Mrs. Robb of her more
repetitive jobs.
A brief survey carried out
amongst the college clubs and
societies seems to ensure that
there WOULD be enough work.
So how about it Exec?
