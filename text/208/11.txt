BLACKETT GOES TO WILSON
Professor P. M. S. Blackett
was appointed last Wednesday
deputy chairman of the Advisory
Council in Mr. Cousins' Ministry
of Technology. It was rumoured
that he would be offered a poli-
tical post, but that he had no in-
tentions of contesting a Parlia-
mentary seat and had refused a
life peerage.
Aged 66, a Fellow of the Royal
Society, a professor of Physics
and former pro-Rector of Im-
perial College, he will be second-
in-command of a team of indus-
trialists, scientists, economists
and trades unionists. This will
be a substantially full-time job.
FROM N A V ¥ TO NOBEL
Educated at the Naval Col-
leges of Osborne and Dartmouth,
he served in the R N only for the
duration of the First World War.
He left to go to Magdalene Col-
lege, Cambridge.
The research work Patrick
Blackett did between the Wars,
on the positron, in particular,
earned him the 1948 Nobel prize
for Physics.
TIZARD AND ROCK
MAGNETISM
His work on a number of com-
mittees, often in association with
Sir Henry Tizard, was a major
factor that led to victory in 1944.
He was concerned especially with
operation research, first with
Anti-Aircraft Command, then
Coastal Command, and, finally,
the Admiralty.
In post-War years his commit-
tee work has concerned defence
policy, atomic energy and nu-
clear research. He has published
several books on atomic strategy,
and, at the same time, "switched"
his research work to rock mag-
netism.
We wish Professor Blackett
well in his new role.
F ace-Lift
for Posters
New publicity regulations will
soon come into force. The present
Internal Events board in the
Union building is to be replaced
by a Weekly Events board; on
this will be recorded the name of
the club, the siting and time of
their event.
Details of the event can be pro-
vided on quarto size sheets posted
beneath in alphabetical containers.
Larger advertisments will have to
be posted on the External Events
board.
New regulations will also be
brought in regarding posters in
Southside. In the near future, all
advertisements will have to be
first approved by the Publicity
officer.
