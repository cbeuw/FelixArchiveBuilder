AERO DEPARTMENT ON
COMMEMORATION DAY
The exhibits-in the Aero Dept.
fell into two broad classifications
—'Aerodynamic and Structural.
The Aerodynamic exhibits in-
cluded a gun tunnel, a supersonic
tunnel, and a ram jet.
The gun tunnel is a compara-
tively cheap device for studying
hypersonic gas flows, each run
being about one twentieth of a
second in duration. With the
supersonic tunnel, however, runs
of up to five minutes are possible.
The ramjet was a particularly
interesting • display, generating
tremendous noise and large
flames with little thrust. Although
a very reliable engine, as there
are no moving parts, its use is
limited because it can only
operate at speeds greater than
300 m.p.h.
On the structure side, several
rigs were shown, designed to give
experimental verifications of
modern theory, some of it deve-
loped in the Department.
MECHANICAL ENGINEER-
ING DEPARTMENT
Visitors were greeted in the
concourse by a large red and
yellow flag bearing a symbolic
beast, the whole being of obscure
relevance. Men vainly searching
for the " gents " were confronted
with doors marked "Techni-
cians," " Academic Staff" or
" Cleaners," whilst both men and
women had doubts about "Stu-
dent's Lavatory."
A display of sensuously shim-
mying springs in the corridor en-
ticed guests into the Vibrations
Lab., where they could learn
about railway vibration prob-
lems and rigid body vibrations in
general. The Mechanisms Lab.
showed their work on artificial
limbs, and the Applied Mechanics
Lab. had a display of Plastic
Fracture Mechanics.
ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING
There were many demonstra-
tions set up in the E.E. Dept.,
varying from a model train driven
by linear induction motor to elec-
tron microscopes. Professor
Laithwaite kept an aluminium
ball suspended in the air and oc-
casionally fired steel washers in
the air by some supernatural
means. There was also a vari-
able speed induction motor,
every traction engineer's dream
(the snag being the cost of the
control gear).
Probably the most interesting
demonstration was in the lecture
theatre, where teaching by tele-
vision was on shown to the ac-
companiment of Mr. Goodlad's
taped commentary. Also there
was a fascinating demonstration
of respiratory control of the heart
rate.
We regret that reports were not
received from the other City &
Guilds depts.
Group Briefing for a 'Management Game', Ashorne Hill.

Nearly 1400 managers and assistant managers have attended
residential courses atthe British Iron and Steel Federation's
own management college in Warwickshire. Courses are
designed to enable men from different departments and
companies to see the steel industry in perspective, to
increase theirtechnical and commercial knowledge, to meet
leading figures in the industry and to practise committee
work. These courses also help them to develop their capacity
for solving management problems, both human and tech-
nical and occasionally to study specialist techniques, such
as Industrial Market Research and Systems Analysis.
The Steel industry regards management as both an Art and
a Science. In addition to its intensive programme of manage-
ment training, the Federation is currently engaged in a
substantial programme of research into management
problems within the industry.
Steel gives a m
a
n the opportunity
to rise b
y ability and achievement,
irrespective of age, in one of
Britain's biggest manufacturing
industries. This is a diverse and
alive industry which welcomes
men who can take responsibility
and play a part in the m
a
n
y new
developments now taking place—
in manufacture, in research, in
application. I
