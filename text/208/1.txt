The bad relations born last session between the students of Southside and the in'iabi an's of
Prince's Gate Mews have worsened a stage further in recent months. Should complaints from (he
Mews residents warrant, Westminster City Council would be pressured into asking for a court injunc-
tion. Initially this would call for an end to any noise and disturbance from the building.
Such an action would not onlv reduce Souths" ders to worse than "boarding-school" existence, but
it would leave <hat part of the building under I.C. Union control as " a white elephant."
If the nuisance persists, a court order can close the building, leaving 400 students homeless and
tragically lowering the prestige of the College.
Noise this term in Southside has been at a noticeably lower level than last year. Warnings have
been issued, particularly by Mr. Stephenson, the Senior Warden, but these are early days yet for
the new year's quota of interns.
Such warnings "have previously been ignored, or soon forgotten. Should the noise continue, Hi
en the last opportunity for reprieve may be long past
Peter Cartwright and Richard Walker investigate—page 3. . .

Clean new cloaks and colour-
ful hoods adorned the learned and
new outfits of the ladies as they
streamed into the Royal Albert
Hall on Thursday, 22nd October.
In everyones mind lurked the
news that the school of tne Archi-
tectural Association was expected
to make a fourth constituent col-
lege at Imperial.
Architecture, and the A A in
particular, turned out to be the
underlying theme of Sir William
Holford's speech, which followed
the Rectors annual review of the
College.
This year was the turn of the
City and Guilds Engineering Col-
lege as hosts of the Conversaz-
zione. Impressive displays had
been set up in their departments.
The eventful day was rounded
off by the highly successful Com-
memoration Ball, as usual Cla-
ridges provided magnificent food
and a continuous supply of fruit
squash.
