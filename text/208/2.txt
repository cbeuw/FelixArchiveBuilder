2 F E L I X
F E L I X has received a number
of letters concerning the I.C. re-
fectories. Below are some points
from them together wi!h Mr.
Mooney's explanations.
1. The food served this year
has been definitely sub-standard
and I am sure no outside caterer
would dare to serve anything like
it for fear of his livelihood.
No outside caterer would take
on the job of serving some 2,400
meals in the space of under two
hours and continue to maintain
the variety of eating places and
dishes available.
2-. Meals are often of low
quality.
This is not true when one con-
siders the low prices of the meals.
Poor quality meat is returned to
the butcher, as happened with
some pork chops some ten days
ago. A visiting dietician com-
mended Mr. Mooney on the
variety of the meals he served.
3. Service is very sluggish . . .
if you do not want chips and peas.
"Everything is sluggish at
times." The time to complain is
there and then. The Spanish
ladies are most co-ogerative if
they are treated with respect.
4. The complaints book has
disappeared.
It is up to the Union Executive
to provide a complaints book.
This has now reappeared.
5. Prices are ridiculous (Slice
of toast 5d. . . .)
This is not true-—toast is 2d.
A menu of breakfast prices is to
appear in S.S. and the Union
REFECTORIES
Cottage pie . . .2/7.
This was a slip which has been
corrected. Our prices compare
favourably with other London
colleges.
6. The food (in S.S.) is cold.
This is due to ventilatory air
for the kitchen which is drawn
from the LOWQT Refectory and
passes over the food on the hot
plate. Alterations will be made.
to choose one dish this will ob-
viously happen.
Mr. Mooney this term has
served an unprecedented number
of meals.
Every evening (with two excep-
tions) there has been at least one
dinner; teas for societies have
numbered two or three a day.
When, a fortnight ago, there was
some muddle over the number of
COMPLAINTS OFFICERS
Beit. . . Adrian Fletcher
7. The Serve ; and Eating
Houses are cold.
Not Mr. Mooney's responsi-
bility.
8. Certain choices are off half-
an-hour after opening.
This should not occur. But if
for some reason everyone decides
Southside . . . Pete Wal'on
diners at an R.C.S. Freshers'
dinner, in half-an-hour he not
onjy provided an additional 50
dinners but also moved the venue
to accommodate the additional
numbers.
Mr. Mooney has probably the
most unenviable job in the col-
lege. He serves a great number
of people all of whom get value
for money (if not, the profits
would be excessive — they are
not). If for some reason you
have a serious complaint, write it
in the Complaints Book. If on
reading the reply you are not
satisfied, see the Refectory Com-
plaints Officer concerned. (See
below.)
C o n g r a t u l a t i o n s ,
Mr. Mooney
Dear Sir,
It is a rare occasion that I write
to the press but, in a sense this is
a follow-up to a brief item in the
late news of your last issue.
You may or may not remember
that a letter was written to Mr.
Mooney concerning the dan-
gerous condition of an artificial
tomato employed in the Lower
Dining Hall in the Beit Building.
Considerable damage to personal
clothing ensued. A prompt reply
was elicited from Mr. Mooney
who regretted the distress caused
by the mishap and although they
could not accept full responsi-
bility for ttie " wielding " of the
" weapon," agreed to shoulder a
cleaning bill for the skirt involved.
In view of Mr. Mooney's cur-
rent bad press, I felt in honour
bound to recount the polite and
courteous treatment meted out to
me.
Yours faithfully,
C. M. THOMPSON.

The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in YOU — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
