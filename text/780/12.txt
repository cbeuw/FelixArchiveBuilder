Age of Chance
Don't Get Mad, Get Even
Blistering H i - N R G thrash from
those loud and loveable people who
brought you the really danceable
cover of Prince's Kiss. Age of Chance
just keep getting better; this time with
a rapid-fire video showing off their
latest Tour de France fashion.
Abrasive vocals top this monster
beat—just try not to dance. Don't get
mad, just get it.

Here to go
1987 and the Cabs are on E M I .
That reads like on of my nightmares
from the late 70s. So what do we get?
A slick and seductive slice of 'vocals
and computer instrumentation'
(although guitars are definitely
present, played by a stranger in the
video). Richard Kirk almost whispers
over a hyphotic and irresistable toe-
tapping backing. Nag, Nag, Nag it
isn't, but the same power lies just
below the surface topped with
confidence. The hi-tec video complete
with manic automata (and the muscle
of EMI) could push this chartwards
in anticipation of the forthcoming
album Code. Has the Cab's time
finally come?

Albums
Depeche Mode
Music for the Masses
Depeche Mode have had top thirty
hits with their singles for over 6 years
now, but there recent albums,
particularly the last, were tending to
reflect on the gloomy side. Music for
the Masses marks a slight change in
direction towards the chart orientated,
although only on the first side. The
other obvious single is Never Let Me
Down Again, which should reach
higher than Strangelove. The songs
are all by Martin Gore; Alan Wilder
hasn't had a look in since 1984; and
betray the former's obsession with
religion, 15 year old girls, and the
futilitiy of life. The only track I can't
get into is the last track Pimpf, an
instrumental which sees the return of
the D M tradition of putting a
30-second snippet of music on the last
grooves on the L P . I don't see the
point personally. Overall, the first
side is a new departure, the second
similar to Black Celebration. I don't
regret buying it, some former D M
fans will.

THEA TRE
people stranded in a large house on
an island, all but one are murdered
at some point, fulfilling the rhymn
which is now about Ten little
travellers. W i t , intrigue and a
melodrama follow each other in rapid
succession, almost distracting you
from trying to identify the murderer.
Oh and by the way, it wasn't the
butler. The set was particularly
impressive, and the acting
consistently good by notables such as
Glynis 'Makepeace' Barber, Rodney
'Likely Lads' Bewes and Geoffrey
'Bergerac' Davies.
Tickets £5 to £13.50.

Hearts of Fire
One only has to think of examples
such as Flashdance and Footloose to
realise that Hollywood excursions
into the realm of popular music
usually leave a lot to be desired.
Presently on release around London
is a new rock music film, Hearts of
Fire which looked, at least
superficially, to be different. For a
start it starred Bob Dylan and Rupert
Everett, the former lending some
musical credibility to the venture and
the latter some trendy young-British-
actor credibility. Noting, however,
that the writers of Hearts of Fire had
also been responsible for one of the
dreadful vehicles mentioned at the
start, my suspicions were aroused.
The story is a rags-to-riches affair
revolving around Molly McGuire,
small time American bar singer, who
gets her big break upon meeting up
with retired rock megastar Billy
Parker (Dylan). He whisks her off
to London where she meets present-
day rock start James Colt (Everett).
With the help of Colt she becomes an
instant success on the 'British Rock
Scene' and the rest of the movie is
devoted to the smash tour and
inevitable relationship with Colt.
Sound cliched? Well, that describes
the film pretty well. Some scenes
were so bad that it was like watching
Spinal Tap or some similar spoof.
Apart from being totally unbelievable
the characters had strange
inconsistencies: Colt, for instance, the
irreverent, hedonistic rock star with
Vodka bottle in hand one minute, and
a caring, sensitive, lover and father
the next; Parker the retired, cynical
rock guru who had 'seen it all' and
then proceeds to smash up hotel
rooms like some 18 year-old heavy
metal singer; and then McGuire, who,
after having only sung in a small night
club all her life, steps out onto centre
stage at the Hammersmith Odeon
without the slightest hesitation or
nervousness but then seems to cry
throughout the rest of the film at the
slightest provocation.
These failures are not the fault of
the cast, though, who do reasonably
well considering the apalling material
they've been given excepting
M c G u i r e , played by real-life
American singer Fiona, who seemed
too inexperienced for a lead role. It
is the script, essentially, that lets the
film down, failing to convince at
every level.
Alas even the music is terrible,
being mostly boring soft-rock
numbers of the Suzi Quatro ilk, and
this, we are asked to believe, is an
instant success on the English club
circuit! The film is an American
movie producer's view of the rock
world, used as a background upon
which to place a standard,
unimaginative, Hollywood plot. It
lived down to all my expectations.
