The sound of no music
Imperial College's music societies are protesting over the loss of the music practice rooms in 52-53 Princes
Gate. They are also concerned that the large music room in the building, currently used by the Chamber Music,
Orchestra and Operatic Societies, will become unavailable next term and that no suitable replacement rooms
have yet been found. The Societies plan to draught a petition to College next week and IC Union is considering
organising a demonstration to indicate the importance of having adequate music facilities within College.
Four practice rooms, equipped with
three pianos, were lost during the
Summer when the new School of
Management took over the Princes
Gate building from the Department of
Humanities, which has since moved
to the Mechanical Engineering
Building. The main music room, on
the second floor of the building, will
be unavailable for the music societies
after Christmas, when conversion
work is due to begin on the ground
and first floors.
In an interview with F E L I X
yesterday, a spokesman from the
School of Management said that the
Music Room would be available for
the rest of this term, but added that
the room might be converted into a
teaching room after Christmas. He
went on to explain that staff might be
moved into the music room whilst the
building conversions were in progress
and said that the resulting dust and
noise would make music practice
difficult. The building work, said the
spokesman, would continue until the
Summer.
It is unclear whether or not the
Thursday lunchtime concerts,
organised b y the Humanities
department, will continue to be staged
in this room. D r Noel Baker, who
organises the concerts, said that he
was unware that building work would
be taking place.
David Norburn, Head of the School
of Management, wrote to the
Chamber Music Society this month
requesting that they investigate
alternatives to the Music Room. The
Society was unable to find any rooms
available of the correct size and
acoustic charecteristics required for
music practice, although the Rector
and College Secretary have since
suggested a number of possibilites.
These include a Common Room on
the top floor of Physics and the lecture
theatres currently under construction
in the former Holland Club i n
Huxley. Also under consideration is
a proposal to utilise the space beneath
the Queens Tower. Commenting on
these suggestions, Malcolm Aldridge,
a member of the College's Music
Committee, said that the Physics
Coffee Room suffered from poor
acoustics because of sound damping
caused by the room's polystyrene tiles
and soft furnishings. He added that
the space beneath the Queens Tower
could only be used if the College was
prepared to spend a large amount of
money to make the area inhabitable,
but said that the Holland Club lecture
theatres might prove suitable,
although this had to be looked into.
Temporary practice facilities and two
pianos have been provided in the
Rector's Conference Room and the
Pippard lecture theatres in Sherfield,
and it is likely that permanent
facilities will be arranged by
November. A store room on level
four o f the building, and the
committee rooms controlled by the
Conference Office along with two
careers interview rooms have been
earmarked as possible locations,
although negotiations are still
underway. The Music Committee is
understood to be unhappy with the
Pippard Theatre and the Conference
R o o m , w h i c h , they s a y , . are
unsatisfactory.
