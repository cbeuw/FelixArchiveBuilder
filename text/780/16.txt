RCS blues
R C S 1st X V 6
L S E 1st X V 30
By and large this is a season of
rebuilding for the R C S rugby squad.
For the first game of the season
they were unlucky to come up against
such a strong side. Although the score
may reflect a bad result, in fact there
was great promise.
The well drilled L S E 1st team took
an early advantage of the inexperience
and lack of cohesion in the recently
restructured R C S side. The first 20
minutes yielded more than half their
points. This was followed by a surge
of R C S team spirit which soon had
the game under control. The second
half was a much more even affair with
RCS cruelly denied several scores by
slippery handling conditions.
Notable performances were by
Mike Fanshawe on the wing and Phil
Clapp playing out of position who
weathered the situation well. Overall
the team's performance showed great
promise for the rest of the season.
Orienteering
Outing
The first outing of Imperial's
Orienteering Club was made to
Bleane Wood near Faversham last
Sunday. Due to considerable interest
at Freshers' Fair, eight new recruits
had their first taste of the sport. The
weather managed to stay bright for
the event but because of torrential rain
during the previous few days a
majority of the course was swamped
with mud. Despite this handicap,
several competitors had good times.
P Smith (Mech Eng I) had an
excellent time on the Red course and
J Paterson had a good time on the
Brown (advanced) course. Morale is
running high at the moment with
events planned every week. If you are
interested in trying a new sport, come
along to the meetings held every
Friday lunchtime from 12.30pm in
either the Brown or Green Committee
Rooms on the top floor of the Union
Building.
