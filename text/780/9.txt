Steppin' Out
Doubtless there's quite a few people
reading this issue that have recently
moved to London to live for the first
time. Many of you will be fairly
excited about the prospect of living
in a city that has everything to offer
as far as enjoyment and 'having a
good time' goes and if the central
location of Imperial College is
anything to go by many of you are in
for a very lively time—not only in
College, where I gather the
Entertainments Committee is very
active, but also discovering some
places that appeal to your own style.
Some people may even find
themselves (and their appearance)
adapting to their environment.
It's a good idea, before actually
committing yourself to a whole night
in one place, to stand outside for a few
minutes and take a good look at the
people who are going in, special
attention should be paid to who the
bouncer is actually letting in too—
either you've got the right look or you
need to go straight home and ask
yourself: "Would you let you i n ? " .
I'm sure you can appreciate that those
of you who have just unpacked your
polka dot puffball skirt and stilettos
will not particularly be welcome (or
feel comfortable) at a club or bar
where everyone is dressed in black
and Doc Martins or vice-versa.
Due to the fact that, generally
speaking, club prices are rather
excessive it's only common sense to
go and have a few drinks beforehand
(damned good excuse anyway!). I can
recommend the following bars if
you're looking for a good start to the
evening—don't overdo it though, it
doesn't give a very good impression
if you fall arse-over-filofax onto the
dancefloor of Stringfellows (where?):
The Dome (King's Road), relaxed
and very continental (can get crowded
at weekends), you can grab some food
and if you find yourself wandering
around Chelsea in a drunken state first
thing in the morning they'll serve you
breakfast as well. Freud's
(Shaftesbury Avenue), this place will
sell you coffee (but that's just a little
bit too cool), it will also sell you
Polish Budweiser in half-litre bottles,
it is situated in a basement underneath
a custom-furniture shop (worth a
look) and the influence of the shop is
reflected downstairs by the slabs of
concrete used as tables (this is real
low-tech). The bar downstairs in the
Kings Head (Gerrard Street, Soho),
is predominantly full of gay men
during the week but on Friday and
Saturday nights the atmosphere is
generally pretty straight (ie not gay),
smoke-filled and loud. If you find
yourself in Covent Garden the Punch
& Judy and Rumours are good
bully-off points and at Palookavilles
you might catch some free jazz
relatively tourist-free.
Right then, time for a quick look
at some of the clubs in London worth
a visit, and some worth avoiding!
E=East London
W=West London
WE=West End
N=North London
S=South London (yeh!)
Bass Clef (Hoxton, E)—Catch some
jazz, salsa and African dance music.
The emphasis is on getting hot and
trying to forget how bad their house
wine is.
100 Club (Oxford St, W E ) - D u r i n g
the week avoid this place unless you
like dixieland jazz otherwise a great
place to see bands—good bar prices
too.
Dingwalls (Camden Lock, N)—A
chance to see your favourite blues
singer in fact Eric Clapton did just
that a couple of weeks ago.
Wag Club (Wardour St,. W E ) —
Young crowd who obviously don't
mind queueing—they think they're
trendy, anyway.
Marquee (Wardour St, WE)—Head-
banger's paradise in recent years.
Fridge (Brixton, S)—Don't let the
initial body search put you off this
club in a converted cinema. The T V
screens show a load of crap but they
make a good backdrop for the lively
and mixed crowd.
Heaven (Waterloo, S)—The crowd
might shock you (just a bit) even on
'straight' nights so go with an open
mind.
Le Beat Route (Greek St, W E ) —
Small, friendly disco atmosphere just
a few too many Italians hugging the
walls.
Hippodrome (Leicester Sq, W E ) —
Don't feel you have to go into the
Hippodrome it's a bit big and bloody
expensive, it's also more entertaining
to stand outside and watch people
trying to get in.
Limelight (Shaftesbury Ave, W E ) —
This club seems to have the very
commendable policy of letting a very
mixed crowd of people in—and that's
what counts.
Rock Garden (Covent Garden,
WE)—Useless venue to see bands,
but they pack 'em in anyway.
Ronnie Scotts (Frith St, W E ) —
Probably the best and most well
known jazz club in Britain—it's worth
splashing out on the odd 'famous old
jazz singer' but also a good place to
see younger (and probably more
lively) bands as well.
Camden Palace (Camden, N)—The
Palace, as it's now known, I'm afraid
has lost its original fashionable status
and is now on a par with The Palais
(formerly Hammersmith Palais), but
Monday night is 'sixties night' and
everyone lets themselves go only to
grab someone else.
Electric Ballroom (Camden, N)—
Variations in the type of music and
presentation by different DJs offer
you something different every night.
Now a chance to mention some of the
places a little bit further out for
example: Zeeta's in Putney is lively
enough and there's always a cortina
driver ready to make a prat of
himself, smells like a Berni Inn
though! The burning question in
Wimbledon seems to be; is Midnight
open again yet? In contrast the
Clarendon Hotel, is incredibly old
and tatty full stop (.)
If as a last resort you find yourself
queueing outside The Empire or
Maximus, Leicester Sq, don't try and
kid yourself that the complete morons
hanging around outside aren't really
going in.
Locally, / think Crazy Larry's in
the King's R d , is awful and 3 r d
Street apparently gives you a discount
and is probably good value.
