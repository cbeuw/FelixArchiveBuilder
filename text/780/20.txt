Dr Paul Eisenklam of the Chemical
Engineering Department died last
week after suffering a heart attack in
the lifts. A n ambulance was called
after three students witnessed him
collapsing out of the lift on level one.
He died in St Stephen's Hospital after
his life support machine was turned
off.
Obituary
Dr Eisenklam had an extremely
distinguished career. He was born in
Germany but moved to Australia
where he was awarded a B Mech Eng
in 1945 from the University of
Melbourne. He received an M S c in
1947 and in 1950 he joined Imperial
College gaining a P h D of the
University of London in 1954. From
then he progressed from Senior
Research Assistant to Lecturer to
Senior Lecturer and in 1982 a Reader.
He returned in 1985 to become an
Emeritus Reader. He was one of the
W o r l d ' s leading authorities on
atomisation and spraying and had an
international reputation for
combustion of particulate systems. In
1976 he visited the University of
Sydney where he established teaching
and research into petroleum reservoir
engineering.,
Dr A Cornish of Chemical
Engineering paid this tribute: " H e
was an enthusiastic research worker
and teacher. He had a tremendous
interest in students, was very caring
and got on well with everyone."
Imperial College Union Rag collected £2,373.64 last Saturday when 150
people went tiddlywinking down Oxford Street. This year Guilds raised
£1,067.94, RCSU £1,058.00 and Mines £247.70. Rag Chairman Nigel
Baker said later that he was very pleased with the total raised especially
as it rained all morning.
Bo back
Guilds motorised mascot Boanerges
has been rebuilt, following fears that
he was 'structurally unsound'. Old
Centralians (the club for present and
former Guilds students) paid for the
vintage car to be stripped down
during the summer. Meanwhile,
'team Bo' a group of students from
City & Guilds College overhauled the
engine.
Several pieces of split timber were
replaced but most of the cracks were
found to be confined to the paintwork.
Modern adhesives, screws and
strengthening pieces were used but
most of the original Bo has been
conserved. The bodywork was
repainted in the traditional colour.
The car is now running and is
expected to be completely ready for
the London to Brighton Run on
November 1st.
STOP PRESS
Thank you to the anonymous person who handed in my

can give you a more personal thank you and a cup of

Big debts
A report from the Department of
Education and Science predicts
University debts approaching £200
million by 1990. Secretary of State for
Education, Kenneth Baker, had used
the document in an attempt to gain
Government funding for universities
and science.
According to the D E S , three
particular problems have been:
academics' pay awards exceeding
budgets; contingency money having
to be used for redundancy payments;
over estimates of recruitments of
overseas students (who are charged
full fees).
New staff
Imperial College Union is hoping to
appoint a new member of staff, to be
responsible for setting up a
computerised accounting system.
The decision to increase the Union
Office staff was taken during the last
academic year, and preparations have
already been made for the Union to
expand into the Upper Lounge.
Although interviews were held early
in the Summer, no suitably qualified
candidate could be found. The
grading of all Union staff has to be
approved by the College's personnel
section, and the Union has now
managed to agree a higher salary for
the post. Hon Sec, Chas Jackson, said
that the new Finance Officer would
reduce the workload on the Deputy
President and the U n i o n
Administrator.

their names forward for the election
of the City and Guilds Vice President:
Tanya Maule (Chem Eng 1), Ken

proposed respectively by Chris
Greenwood, Chris Mason, Paul
S k i p w o r t h , Dave Hudson. A

Kemmler arrives
A new piano was delivered yesterday
after money was made available for
its purchase by College Secretary
John Smith. The Kemmler piano cost
£575 and will be placed in the Union
Dining Hall. A second piano will be
bought in the next few weeks for
Southside. The Union piano will be
used for parties, dinner and barnights
when it will be moved downstairs.
Anyone wishing to use the piano
should contact Chas Brereton through
the IC Union Office.
Summer ascents
The Imperial College East Karakoram
Expedition achieved first-ascents of
four peaks in the Himalayas during
the Summer. Ten people were to take
part in the ten-week long expedition,
but three of them were taken ill and
had to return home. The rest of the
team climbed Tsiblu 3, Zarn 3, White
Peak, and Ice Horn, all previously
unclimbed and 5400 to 5600 metres
high.
Health drive
The Health Centre has started a new
drive to publicise the alternative
facilities it offers. These include
acupuncture, which is available on
Wednesday afternoons and has
usually been in heavy demand.
Besides this, there is an osteopath,
and a method of improving posture,
the Alexander technique, is also due
to be started.
