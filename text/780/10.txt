David Jones takes a personal look at this year's Edinburgh
Fringe and reviews Imperial College's Beit Theatre plays.
Too many years of watching Dramsoc
productions have made it difficult to
sit through any of their shows without
watching the cast instead of their
characters. This was the chief reason
why I did not enjoy Bent, Beit
Theatre's most successful play of the
1987 Fringe, as much as most
members of the large audience which
saw it with me.
Though it is difficult to judge their
performances objectively, it did seem
that the two leading players had
â€¢

modelled their characters too closely
upon themselves. This was an easy
conclusion to reach, however,
because both Andy Meeson (Horst)
and Simon Lewis (Max) suited their
roles very well. In fact the play was
very well cast all round, and it says
a lot that, far from there being any
actors who were only along for the
ride, some of the most impressive
performances were given by the
supporting characters.
Bent, by Martin Sherman, is a
sensitive play about the persecution
of homosexuals in pre-war Nazi
Germany. When the leaders of the SA
are executed, G e r m a n y ' s
homosexuals lose their only ally in a
position of power. The central
character, Max, and his lover spend
two years on the run from the Nazis,
but are captured and sent to Dachau.
Only Max survives the journey to the
concentration camp.
The second half of the play is an
account of the relationship between
Max and Horst, another homosexual
prisoner. Consigned to continually
move stones, and even though they
are not allowed to touch or even be
seen to converse, the two men
develop a deep love for one another.
The camp guards are always a
fearsome presence, but really the play
is more like a classical love story
where the lovers are prevented from
being together; that they are
homosexuals in a concentration camp
is secondary.
The play was codirected by the two
leading actors. Directing from the
floor is a tough prospect, and can be
detrimental to the other actors. O n
this occasion there was no hint of this.
Mark Taylor arguably stole the show
with his portrayals of the effeminate
Rudy, and the truly gruesome captain
at Dachau. I particularly liked Mike
Stone's drag act as Greta, owner of
a Berlin nightclub. Ciaran Hassett is
not used to playing old queens, but
his performance as Max's uncle was
one o f the most natural and
accomplished.
Nazi Germany is not a new setting
for the theatre, and homosexuality is
not a new subject, but the play has a
warmth and a gentle humour which
set it aside from less sensitive pieces.
If you get a chance to see this play
don't let it pass.

EDWARD UBEE
' ' A game of two halves'' would have
been David Coleman's comment if he
had been in Edinburgh this August to
see Beit Theatre perform Edward
Albee's Seascape. (Apologies to
Private Eye readers). This is one of
those plays where we witness real
reactions to an unreal situation. A n
elderly couple are spending a day at
the seaside, reminiscing and arguing.
After forty minutes of dialogue which
is fairly undemanding on the
audience, two green reptiles appear
from the sea to confront the 'ordinary'
humans.
Perhaps this play is best appreciated
a short time after seeing it, when the
one-paced first half can be considered
in relation to the much snappier
second half. To develop a discussion
of how mankind sees itself, of how
our perception of our own 'supreme'
intelligence should be questioned, a
rather bizarre situation is required. I
do not pretend that took in everything
the author intended, but I did enjoy
the production and will be making
efforts to see more of Albee's work.
Overall the cast of four did
exceptionally well with a difficult
script. Dramsoc regulars M i k e
Foulds, Portia Smith and Sam
Duerden were all on form, and special
mention must be made of T o m
Brandon, a newcomer to ICDS, who
coped admirably with the most
demanding part. Unlike so many
student amateurs, he has the right
build for a fifty year old (no offence,
Tom).
This play was performed with
practically no set and no props, and
I could not help thinking, not for the
first time, that this is the best type of
production to take to Dramsoc's
Fringe venue. Though the first act
was rather static, the second half was
well blocked and thoughtfully
directed. I look forward to seeing
more of the same at next year's
Fringe.
