Freshers' Week
In the words of the prophet, " I ' m
glad it's all over". Highlights of the
week were arranging to get the
women's toilets unblocked on
Monday night, and trying to set up the
Main Dining Hall for Freshers' Fair.
John Noble and the Ents team did a
superb job, and were efficient enough
to take considerable pressure off the
duty officers (Alan, Ian and myself).
Also Chris Martin was immensely
helpful for both supervising Union
Card checks in Beit Archway and
driving minibuses until late at night.
The minibus taxi system will continue
at other late night events during the
year. Considering that nobody got
much sleep, I am amazed that
everyone managed to last so well.
Union Cards
The new system of colour-coded
cards worked much better than I
expected. Let's hope (fingers crossed)
that College are actually able to
improve their residence security now
that we have managed to find a
workable sytem. Particular thanks
must go to Jane Spiegel and Steve
Kilmurray, who kept the system
working when I had to be elsewhere
(which was most of the time, to be
quite honest).
Halls Insurance
Still the cheques flow in thick and
fast. Cheques are in my office for the
following people:
C Flores
C Niskier
Also, having now worked out the
mess from last year, I need further
information about their claims from
the following people.
J Cooper
Giles Scott
T Kosbinen
L McCauley
M Astell
J Jones
F Katel
R McBryde
These claims cannot be setded until
I have this information, so please
contact me as soon as possible.
General Waffle
Due to the demands of Freshers'
Week, I have to admit that general
office work has taken a backburner
for the first week of term. Hopefully
by the time of printing (what a lousy
old cliche), I will be up to date and
organised in the office. However I
operate on the cautious but
philosophically viable grounds that
the unexpected will always occur.
Anyone with any spare money could
do worse than invest in midnight lamp
oil, coffee or proplus tablets.
