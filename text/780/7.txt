Sarah—
"I didn't go to it. I've done it twice already, thefirsttwo
years were the same as each other so I didn 't want to do
it again, I ignore Freshers, I haven't talked to anyone who
went. "
2. What did you think of
Freshers' Week?
Wong Sun Wai—
' 7 went to the Union Fair
and a few ofthe meetings. I
have to allow myself more
time to get used to London.
I'm a bit lost. "
Graham—
"I thought it was
absolutely fantastic, I went
to every event and got
excellent value for money.
I've been ice skating, pole
vaulting.. .oh sorry, I
shouldn't say that!'
David—
' 'It was too crowded. The
groups were good. I liked the
'Blue Aeroplanes' and the
'Brilliant Comers' were OK.
There were just so many
people there. I went to the
RCS UGM. They seem quite
a bunch of dossers! It was
good to see that somebody
wasn't taking the thing quite
so seriously. "
Mathew—
"When was Freshers'
Week? (Last week). Was it?
Oh I didn't know, I didn't do
any ofthe Freshers things. I
painted pictures. (The
events) didn't tempt me. "
Robert—
"/ went along to the
evening events but didn 'tfind
them that interesting. It's
alright if you're into bands
and just music but there's
not much else going on is
there ? I think Freshers' Fair
is very good. "
Nina & Suva—
"Imet loads ofpeople. I liked the Comedy Night the best but
the last guy was awful! We went to the reception. I can't
remember the Rector's speech. Ifell asleep. I didn't approve
of the flanning. There are quite a lot of squares in this place
and they've been really put offfrom the Union. The Editor of
FELIX shouldn't keep putting down the people in the Union like
lan all the time because it doesn't set a very good impression.
If she feels so bad about it maybe she should tone it down a
bit and then later on bring it up. "
