NEWS
The newspaper is produced by the
Public Relations Department, under
the leadership of Iain More. M r More
took on the mantle of Editor for the
first edition, although, as the Rector
points out in his front page
introduction, the paper is still seeking
a full time Editor. The front page
states that the publication is not
intended as a mouthpiece for College
supremos, but on flipping through the
slim twelve page propoganda sheet,
the readers will quickly form their
own impression. After all, the Public
Relations Department can hardly be
[ ( considered impartial.
The paper's obviously expensive
production at the time of Imperial
College's financial crisis makes one
wonder whether a 'Public Relations'
exercise is justified. Even the Rector
mentions this fact in his leader article.
Prof Ash continues by debating
whether the launch was premature,
considering the lack of an Editor and
a shortage of readable articles. It is
surprising that they came down on the
side of early publication, as the
content of the first edition risks an
early loss of readership.
The style of writing is dry and
impersonal, leaving nothing to the
imagination. In all cases the
newspaper attempts to show Imperial
in a glowing light to an almost painful
extent. This is not surprising since the
Editor is also Director of the Alumnus
Office and Fund Raising. This last
fact may explain why a quarter of the
space is devoted to the subjects of St
Mary's merger, and the activities of
the Alumnus Office. We are also
given a taster of what to expect in the
next edition, a feature on Public
Relations.
There is also a full page 'interview'
with Union President Ian Howgate.
After discussion with M r Howgate on
the date of publication (Tuesday) it
became clear that even though he had
had an informal chat with M r More
on the subject of the new College
newspaper, the question of an
interview never arose. The
photograph of M r Howgate printed
alongside the feature had been
obtained from F E L I X by the Public
Relations Office (of which M r More
is director) on the pretext that it was
to be used for the College Annual
Report.
The article on Ian is the antithesis
of the staff-student relationship at
Imperial. With phrases like 'summer
88 is unlikely to see Ian Howgate end
up any more than a relatively obscure
figure', and 'he was still winding
down—or was he still wound up?—
over a meeting', the author pulls no
punches. Throughout, Ian is
portrayed as a figurehead with
'limited ambitions', and making little
impact during his term of office.
The last paragraph consists of a
torrent of praise for the Rector, and
lambasts the efforts of the Union
President as being ultimately
ineffective, 'a year is a short time at
Imperial and student Presidents come
and go'.
The back page hosts a column
entitled 'sport'. The sole article in the
section being a praise ridden
glorification of IC Boat Club. The
piece on Michael Arthur's favourite
club manages to incorporate the
subjects of Public Relations, fund
raising, and the ever helpful Alumnus
Office in one fell swoop.
One might assume that a sports
article would be the least susceptable
to manipulation for propoganda
purposes, but not even Pravda
achieves this sort of mileage out of
rowing.
The only column inch of unbiased
text is the small ad on page nine
advertising a cottage to let. Even this
is marred by the contact number (ext
3004) which happens to be, surprise
surprise, the Press and Public
Relations Office, 546b Sherfield.
