Spate of
thefts at Ball
The Union is taking steps to arrange
cloakroom facilities for
entertainments events in the Union
Building, following a spate of thefts
at last Friday's Freshers' Ball. Over
£100 in cash, several jackets, credit
cards and a passport have been
reported stolen. Commenting on the
incident security chief Geoff Reeves
highlighted the need for greater
controls at the door to parties and
urged party-goers not to leave their
property unattended.
Huge profits
Ents have made an estimated £10,000
from the Freshers events, it was
revealed today. The profits will be
used to subsidise future
entertainments events said Ents
Chairman John Noble.

City and Guilds may not be able to
pay the fine of 50 pints of blood
imposed after the flanning at last
week's Freshers' Reception. The
Blood Transfusion Service will only
visit College if at least 150 pints are
donated.
The City and Guilds President Dave
Tyler said that Guilds will be able to
provide the 150 pints, although at the
time of going to press only 29 pints
had been promised.
Anyone wishing to donate should
sign up in the Guilds Office. M r Tyler
has pointed out that the offer is open
to anyone and not just Guilds
students.
Network
launched
The first edition of Network, a new
newspaper intended for IC staff, was
published last Monday. This edition
was editted by Ian More, College
Director of Public Relations, although
a permanent Editor is currently being
sought. Distribution is to staff via the
internal mail system, and it is
intended to be a monthy publication.

Snooker
Club in exile
The Snooker C l u b has been
suspended from the London Shipping
Company League for one year
because of poor facilities. Snooker
Club Captain, Richard Wiles told
F E L I X that the shortage of rests and
balls had been rectified but
commented that there was still a
problem with people walking through
the room during matches. "This has
a very serious effect on the
concentration of the players" he said.
Financial
planning
planned
Imperial College Union is to set up
an appeals structure for students who
have had their degree stopped. A t the
moment, students may have their
degree stopped if they are in debt to
the College. The Union intends to
offer a financial planning service to
help students with their debts. Ian
Howgate said that he hopes the moves
by IC Union will form an initiative
towards a University of London
policy on degree stops and appeals.
No comment
Norman's—the Union Snackbar—has
started serving newspapers at
lunchtimes. Unfortunately they do not
contain fish & chips; all are of the
unhealthy, bleached white variety and
Manager Norman Jardine has no
plans to introduce the 'vaguely
brown' Financial Times.
The most popular flavour is The
Independent, although sales of the
different papers are very similar with
about three copies of each paper
stocked sold per day.
Norman pointed out that The Times
and The Sun were not stocked because
he didn't want any stick from trendy
lefty students. If he had his way then
only The Sun, Star and The Sporting
Life would be sold. True to form,
carnivores face a hard time at
Norman's with requests for The
Sunday Sport greeted with "sorry—
no meat today".
