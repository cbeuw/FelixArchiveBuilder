Unusable Room
Dear Judith,
Some readers of F E L I X will by now be aware of the
serious threat to music at IC posed by the change in usage
of 52-53, Princes Gate, formerly the Humanities
Department, now the School of Management. Many will
not appreciate the potentially devastating effect this may
have, some will not even know there has been a change.
There is no secret about the intentions of the Rector in
bringing about this change and in recruiting Professor
Norburn to run the School of Management. It is seen as
a means of providing substantial income for the College
and at the beginning of a third term of Conservative
government one can hardly blame the Rector for seeking
any means of supplementing the U G C grant. However,
if it is to be at the cost of College music then I find it
wholly unacceptable.
As a college with no Music Department it has always
been difficult to find adequate facilities for rehearsals and
concerts but now it could become almost impossible. In
the Music Room we have not just a good facility, we have
a perfect room for all manner of musical activities from
solos and recitals to chamber orchestra and chamber choir
concerts, which has been the focal point for much of the
Musical life of the College.
Its advantages, and the disadvantages of all the proposed
alternatives, are its superb acoustics, its size, its availability
and the fact that it has a piano of a reasonable standard.
I would be delighted to hear from anyone who can name
me one room in College which combines all of these
qualities, it is my belief that such a room does not exist.
At present we have been granted use of the room for
3 concerts this term but after Christmas building alterations
and redecoration will render it unusable. Already we are
being asked to find other places to rehearse. The chances
of us being able to use it again do not look good unless
we can convince the necessary people that this room must
remain a music room.
Ironically, the College has recently been making a big
point of telling prospective students (in a glossy, colour
brochure) how good the music at IC is, as indeed it is,
with the intention of attracting students keen to take part
in extra-curricular musical activities. The policy appears
to have been successful; last year Tony Neal, brass winner
of the BBC's Young Musician of the Year competition,
came to study at IC and this year Geoffrey Silver, leader
of the National Youth Orchestra has started a Maths
degree. I cannot imagine that they are very impressed by
the facilities here.
Alan Downie, Maths PG,
Chairman, Chamber Music Society.
Damp Squib
Dear Judith,
There has been much adverse criticism of the Guilds
Hitsquadding members of the I C U Exec at the Freshers'
Reception on Monday morning. The flanning has been
carried out for the last few years, and it is intended to
publicise the Hitsquad prior to Rag Week and add some
light relief to the Reception. No member of I C U Exec
can say that they were surprised when it happened; it's
traditional!
Last year Hitsquad raised over £600 from 'contracts'
taken out at Rag Week and Covent Garden. So please
unless anyone has any better ideas to raise that much
money let's continue this great traditional event.
Members of Guilds who carry out the 'hits' put a great
deal of time and effort into organising the 'hits'. The
victims are never hurt at all physically unlike the
Hitsquadders who sometimes can get violently attacked
by 'targets' who seem to lack either a sense of humour
or charity ie Alan Ego and Charles Takeiteasy who
appeared to be practising for a wrestling tournament at
Monday's Reception. (They also get paid £3,300 per
annum after tax and NI.)
Hitsquad will now be out of action until we can raise
50 pints of blood. Before then we would be most grateful
if anyone who wears contact lenses or has ill feeling about
being flanned comes and leaves their name in the Guilds
Union Office and suitable precautions will be taken.
There have been questions raised as to whether or not
the Guilds Exec did or didn't know about the event before
hand. It would have been impossible for them to have
known due to the fact that the hit was neither thought of
or organised until half way through the Rector's addressing
speech. In other words they had as much knowledge about
the event as any person who has been at IC for any period
of time.
We hope this has made the situation a lot clearer for
all involved or interested.
Yours, with Rag in mind,
City & Guilds Hitsquad.
PS If anyone is interested in donating blood then please
sign up in the Guilds Office. The Blood Transfusion
Service will be visiting IC on 6th November. Thankyou.
Grateful thanks
Dear Judith,
Further to your article last week concerning the new
R S M U Office; I feel it would be appropriate to thank one
or two more people.
We are particularly grateful to John Smith (College Sec),
John Archer (Head of M R E Dept), Ted Brown (now
lecturing Head of Engineering in the University of
Queensland) and Barry Holt (Departmental
Superintendant) for all their help and support.
Yours sincerely,
Geoff Parsons
God help ICU
Dear Judith,
I have just left the Great Hall after the Freshers' U G M ,
which is usually the best-attended U G M of the year.
However, today's was not only inquorate but possibly the
worst-attended U G M I've ever been to. I am naturally
disappointed about this, as the meeting was advertised in
the Freshers' Handbook, in Monday's F E L I X , and with
posters around College. Where were all the Freshers??
If today's U G M attendance means that we've plunged to
hitherto-unknown depths of apathy with this year's
freshers, then God help IC Union. I only hope that there's
an alternative explanation—if anybody knows what it is,
I'd love to know.
Yours,
Alastair J Seymour, UGM Chairman.
