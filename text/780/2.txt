This week has been the usual anti-
climax that every Week 2 in my
memory has been. By now most
Freshers will have found their niche
in their own little clique or tried to
break into those already long-
established ones at this place.
Consequently this 'fun-packed
F E L I X ' isn't quite so fun-packed as
last week's. Having said this, you
must read our Edinburgh fringe
feature in the centre pages,
particularly the review of 'The
Collection/The Lover' which is
having its postview next week in the
Union Building. Don't let the review
put you off! We've also received two
thought-provoking, but very
different, articles from Kemi Adenubi
and Richard Fincher. The first is an
opinion article inspired by the anti-
abortion letter in the last issue. The
second is an overview of Genesis, the
soul, life, the universe and
everything. We welcome all types of
articles at F E L I X and we usually
publish most copy that we receive (as
long as it's readable, concise and not
libelous, etc, etc).
Eye Spy
I always enjoy reading our Eye Spy
quotes (see page 7) but found Nina's
& Suya's particularly interesting
because they were talking about me!
They believe I criticise the President
too much. Let me assure you that I've
been pussy-footing around
(geddit?)—I could have criticised him
ten-fold, but don't want to bore you
stupid with reams and reams on
everything I think he's handled badly.
Perhaps most of you wish to be left
in blissful ignorance. It doesn't really
effect you anyway—does it?
Council
Monday's Council was cancelled.
Who cancelled the Council? Why was
Council cancelled? (A prize of a
F E L I X t-shirt to the first person who
can say those three sentences in
succession three times without
stopping). Council is the second
highest Union body—the highest
being a Union General Meeting—and
allows questions and debate between
all the Union Officers. It is a very
important meeting. It should only be
cancelled if all the Executive come
down with bubonic plague. On
Monday all six members were at
work, all Union Officers had
rearranged other meetings to make the
evening free and Deputy President,
Alan Rose's report was being finished
off. But Council was cancelled and no
reasons were given. There was no
notice, no apologies, no explanations,
no nothing. Council is now next
Monday when meetings that had been
rearranged from last Monday were to
have taken place; other plans have
been made. Plans will have to be
cancelled otherwise who's going to
represent you and me? Pull your
fingers out, boys!
T-Shirts
We still have a few F E L I X t-shirts left
but they're all smaller sizes from fhe
original batch. Obviously
everybody's been eating too many
chocolates recently. We at F E L I X
have noticed that it is winter (we left
the Office recently) and obviously t-
shirts are out and sweatshirts are in,
so we have ordered some grey
sweatshirts with the F E L I X design.
Expect to see hip & groovy people
wearing them around College in the
next few weeks.
Calendars
Many of you may not have obtained
a copy of the Freshers Issue of
F E L I X If you want one of the special
limited edition year planners which
we gave out with this issue please
drop into the F E L I X Office, Beit
Quadrangle and we'll be happy to
provide you with one.
Staff
I am deeply indebted to the three
Freshers who have helped produce
F E L I X this week and to all our new
contributors. However, I'm a
naturally greedy person, so I want
more of you to submit articles, letters
or generally pop in the Office and get
involved. M y News Editor will be
particularly welcoming if you want to
do some news writing.
There will be a staff meeting today
at 1.00pm. Everybody is welcome to
attend. We will be pulling this issue
to pieces, thinking of new features,
drinking lots of coffee—collating?
