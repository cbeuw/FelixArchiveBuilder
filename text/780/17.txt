Currying favour
Ever been to a Currysoc meeting?
Ever been to a real Currysoc meeting?
Well, here's your opportunity—
Currysoc will be meeting every
Monday lunchtime from 12.30pm in
Southside Upper Lounge, to arrange
restaurant trips and to exchange useful
tips of cooking spicy food. The
Society is by no means limited to
curries and will be indulging in
Malaysian, Mexican, Indonesian etc
as well as vegetarian food. So if you
would like to join one of the smallest
and most friendly clubs in IC, turn up
on Monday.
And now the first Currysoc review:
The Indian Tandoori Take-away on
North End Road, Fulham. About five
minutes walk from West Ken tube,
this is a must for students in the
F u l h a m / H a m m e r s m i t h area.
Although at first sight it doesn't
appear to be anything special, the
food is of very high quality with lean
meat and full servings guaranteed. A l l
of the standard curries are on the
menu; the best mild curry on offer is
the Bhuna, and for the fire eaters I
would recommend the Madras which
has a deliciously sour flavour
exemplified by the nuances of fresh
coriander. The Phall is deadly, though
I am told that it is not as hot as it could
be. There are also many vegetable
dishes on offer if you don't feel like
eating meat. Best of all are the
prices—for about £5 you can buy
more than enough to eat, even if
you're starving.
Summary: Quality excellent,
quantity excellent, fairly cheap.
Christianity is not a religion
(If not, what is it?)
f you have ever tried communicating
with an ant, you will quickly have
realised that their horizons are severely
limited and their perceptions are quite
inadequate for the task. To have any
success you would need to become an
ant.
If by "religion" we mean man's search
for the divine, then Christianity is not a
" F o r G o d s e n t his s o n into the w o r l d ,
not to c o n d e m n the world but that the
w o r l d might b e s a v e d t h r o u g h h i m "
J o h n 3:17
religion but a revelation. Unlike other
holy books the Bible does not bring us
the story of men in search of God; it tells
us about the God who comes in search
of men.
It may well be more comfortable to
be religious but it is no substitute for a
relationship with the living God through
His Son Jesus Christ.

Build a Beetle
"Capri drivers don't wave to each
other!" says Adrian Brimer (EEIJ) as
he announced the formation of VW
Beetle Soc. The Society hopes to
provide books and magazines for
reference, organise trips to V W
events like the 'bug push', and there
are plans to restore a beetle.
At present the Society is only
provisional, and they are still looking
for the 20 signatures required to set
up a club. Those interested should
contact Adrian, who added "Beetle
drivers are a much nicer bunch of
people".
Several new clubs are also in the
process of formation. These include
a Socialist Workers Society which
will be formed in collaboration with
students from Imperial and St Mary's
Medical School which is due to merge
with Imperial College in October
1988.

Lt Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell and Lt
Nick 'Goose' Bradshaw are assigned
to Top Gun, an elite corps of officers
who many believe are the finest
fighter pilots in the world. There they
begin a gruelling training progamme
in air-to-air combat.
Stunning and highly exciting aerial
photography make this a film not to
be missed!
Raw talent
Congratulations go to Mark Hobbs of
Physics who won this year's
Freshers' Tournament, which was
held on Sunday. The the final, he
overcame Peter Ebbs with a
convincing 3-0 win and also recorded
the highest break of 27.
This reflected the standard of play
which was generally quite poor. Even
so, there were a few raw talents wuch
as G Garbrah, K Y Wan, R Pickles
and N Leonard, who could be names
to look out for in the future.
The winner collected £25 and a
trophy, with the runner-up receiving
£9. A n amazing 36 people entered
this year as opposed to last year's
feeble six, so a big thankyou to Andy
Poon who helped organise and run the
tournament.
There will be more snooker
tournaments in the future with,
hopefully, even bigger prizes, so keep
chalking your cue and polishing your
balls and remember, practice makes
perfect.
FELIX Friday October 16th 1987 17
