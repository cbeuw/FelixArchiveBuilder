Soul Searching
Most Victorians
believed Genesis
implicitely,
Animals were not
allowed into
church because
they had no souls.
God made man in
his own image,
with an immortal
soul, and the
animals were a
totally separate
creation;
ornaments on a
mantlepiece.
People had suggested ways in which
animal groups were related before,
such as Le Marc, the inventor of the
rubber giraffe, which stretched its
neck to reach high trees, and bore
young with longer necks.
Darwin's sin was to suggest the
inclusion of man in this scheme of
things. The implications were of
course that man was no longer
directly a child of God, and that one
had either to credit at least the
primates with immortal souls too, or
to deny the soul which had made
down-trodden people semi-resigned
to their lot since the feudal times. If
these people couldn't be sure of
eternal life in Heaven watching their
rich masters burn in hell, they were
much more likely to shout about
workers rights. This theory of
evolution was dangerous to religion
and politics, and for decades it was
forbidden to teach it in shcools in the
most powerful free societyâ€”the
United States.
With the new century, psychology
was being practised more, and it
seemed that terms like Ego and Id
were components of the soul.
However, the new approach to what
had been called madness that came
with it, meant that rather than locking
up people who behaved abnormally,
and pronouncing them to be
possessed, some of the less severe
cases could be treated with new but
primitive techniques that had nothing
to do with exorcising evil spirits.
Some of these conditions, now their
reality is no longer denied, throw up
interesting questions about the
mind/body realtionship, and about the
soul. Senility, in which the sufferer
eventually looses nearly all aspects of
their personality, goes a long way to
show how much of a personality
resides in an immortal soul and how
much can be destroyed by
precipitation of salts in the brain. If
such aspects of personality cannot
survive life intact, they are most
unlikely to survive death.
Multiple personality, in which the
sufferer has within one body, totally
separate personalities with separate
memories, often unaware of each
other, is difficult to explain in terms
of a single soul. It has even been
shown that memories are stored
physically in the brain, and what is
a person without memories? Still
feelings, attitudes and emotions
perhaps, but even these can be
changed by chemicals such as anti-
depressants, pentothal, and other so-
called truth-drugs. So what attributes
are part of an immortal soul?
If humans have evolved from a few
proteins in the sea, there must have
been some stage at which a soul
evolved too, if we have such a thing.
Of course you can say that lower
animals have souls which are less
developed, and this is certainly a good
argument for vegetarianism, but
immortality is a clear cut thing. There
must have been some point at which
a developing soul became immortal
and what of the first one. Heaven
must have been a very lonely place
with just God, Jesus and the first
immortal soul to arrive. Of course it
must be much more crowded now,
however there is only room for
144,000, according to Revelations.
What of the 144,001st soul at St
Peter's Gate? What if it were some
really deserving soul who had lived
a saintly life? A religious authority
told me that the figure of 144,000 was
no longer appropriate, and that John
the Divine had based it on the world
population at that time, I was always
told that the Bible was divinely
inspired, but if that bit isn't, which
other parts aren't? Genesis perhaps?
or Romans?
A human being is a remarkably
complex thing, and whether or not it
has a soul will not be a matter of fact
for many decades I suspect. But what
of a single cell human zygote, does
that have a soul? Embryo research is
frowned upon by the Church on the
basis that the fate of the embryo in the
lab constitutes murder, so they seem
to say yes. What kind of soul is that?
The idea that we have evolved from
protein in the sea and that all we are
is determined by our physical
structure is fairly unbelievable, but so
is a belief in man's immortal soul and
in the individual creation by God of
unchanging animal species without
souls. However, a belief in the
immortal soul does have a huge
advantage. It saves people from
having to contemplate their own
destruction. We are all egotists in the
sense that we don't want to die. Those
non-religious people who ignore the
issue entirely, often get quite irritated
by talk of death and souls. Many such
people experience religious
conversion in later life, or are
christened on their death bed, as
happened to Constantine. Personally,
I'd rather die than have eternal life.
