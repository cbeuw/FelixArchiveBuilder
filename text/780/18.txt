OPINION
What positive
alternatives?
Recently, men seem to be taking an
inordinate interest in a subject which
is of crucial importance to
women—abortion.
Contrary to the simplistic
arguments presented by anti-abortion
supporters, the 9 month period during
which a woman carries a baby wreaks
major changes in her body and life,
especially on her standing in society.
The majority of women definitely
do not see abortion as a simple
morning-after birth control method-
it's far too traumatic an experience to
be taken so lightly. Abortion figures
are blithely quoted with insufficient
elaboration. F o r example what
percentage of women above child
bearing age ever have abortions, and
more to the point, how many women
have more than one abortion? Also,
how many of these unwanted
pregnancies are statistics of
contraceptive failure? Unreported and
acquaintance rapes are also a real
problem.
I, too, am pro-life—the mother's
life. I will not argue about when life
begins—every fertilised egg is a
potential human being. The woman
is an actuality, a human being who
has been existing independent of her
mother's womb for quite some time.
She deserves the right to a real and
safe choice as to what happens to her
body. Protection from the trauma and
risk of an illegal abortion should be
her fundamental right.
Positive alternatives to having an
abortion are a good idea because they
increase a woman's options. The
Positive Alternatives to Abortion
group at College is a lousy idea. Last
term, they managed to fill numerous
College pigeonholes with their
sensationalist' 'if you were born after
1967 you are a survivor of the 1967
abortion act" leaflets.
This was not positive. I am a
woman—one of the 16% of people at
this College who is ever likely to need
an abortion. W h y haven't they
managed to send me any information
about positive alternatives?
I think this group of anti-
abortionists (they are mostly men)
should stop masquerading under the
caring title of P A T A .

Phew-wee so that's what it's like to
run Freshers' Week! Thanks to all of
you who came throughout the week,
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Sincere apologies to those who were
turned away from the Comedy Night
and a very special word of thanks to
those fine souls who left their calling
cards in various Union rooms on
Friday night.
This week I have two gigs to tell
you about, the first being Circus
Circus Circus who are appearing on
Friday 16th Oct in the Lounge at
about 9pm and as I explained last
week they are well worth seeing.
Secondly next Thursday ie the 22nd
of October, you can catch one of the
most refreshing young bands I've
seen in ages; Jim Jiminee, an
energetic dance combo who can do no
wrong as far as I'm concerned. Both
events will be accompanied by discos
and late bars, the ticket prices are £1
in advance, £1.50 on the door or 50p
with an Ents card. If you want to buy
tickets they will be on sale in the
Union Office, Norman's and the JCR
most lunchtimes. A s for obtaining
Ents cards, send a cheque for £7 and
one picture (passport size) of yourself
to: IC Ents, Student Union, Imperial
College. Cheques should be made
payable to Imperial College Union.
Finally all of you who failed to
collect your tickets for Freshers'
Week will have your cheques
returned as soon as internal mail can
deliver them.
