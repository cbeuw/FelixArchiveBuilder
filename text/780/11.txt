The only Harold Pinter play with
which I am familiar is The Caretaker,
a work which made the author famous
for his pauses. The impression sticks,
so I was pleased that neither The
Collection nor The Lover, presented
by Beit Theatre as a double bill,
turned out to be such heavy going.
The Collection is an intruiging play.
The jealous husband confronts his
unfaithful wife's young lover, and
tries to bully him into admitting his
adultery. The 'lover' and his older
friend with whom he lives deny that
anything has occurred. Early on you
are inclined to believe the husband,
but by the end of the play the sides
of the argument are delicately
balanced; a good point at which to
finish.
The play hangs on the
psychological battle between the
husband (Ciaran Hasett) and the
young man's mentor, Harry (Walter
Eaves). Both men gave skilful
performances and at times showed up
the other two members of the cast,
neither of whom, I felt, had really
mastered their characters. Walter
Eaves in particular carried off his role
with a great deal of panache and was
clearly comfortable on stage. I am
inclined to blame lack of direction for
any failings in the other actors.
The Lover is an exercise in role-
playing for two actors. A married
couple (Mike Foulds and Tessa
Hoxey) live for part of their day in
a pretend w o r l d , where each
represents a different character to the
other; to the wife the husband is her
lover and to the husband the wife is
his whore. Each fictional character is
aknowledged and approved of by
husband and wife in their normal
roles. We are not told how long the
couple have been indulging in their
infidelities. This wierd arrangement
is jeopardised by the restless husband,
who decides to try and change the
rules of their game.
Mike Foulds and Tessa Hoxey both
turned in good performances, but
again I thought that the play was
slightly under-directed. To be fair to
the company, though, it is very
difficult to make any production look
convincing when the actors have to
negotiate any amount of set on the
cramped stage at Theatre West End,
Edinburgh.

Pippa Salmon reveals the
secrets of the Edinourgh
Fringe Festival
Would you like to sleep with fourteen
other people, stand in the torrential
rain watching firewords to the strains
of distant music or rub shoulders with
'real actors' and Arty People?
If you're at all interested, rush to
book a ticket to Edinburgh, August
1988 immediately! Soon you will be
leaping from the coach/train/car
sleeping bag in hand and heading for
one of the thousand shows on the
Fringe. Before you know it you will
be flicking through the Fringe Guide
and scanning the Daily Diary like an
old hand. As you stroll casually into
the Fringe Club, you may reflect on
the dull London scene, contrasting
sharply with the amazing theatrical
performances y o u have just
experienced. On the other hand, you
may just be amazed at the building
(which is the Edinburgh University
Student U n i o n Building)—and
perhaps wish it would stop raining...
Each August, IC Dramsoc people
become Fringe People. They pack up
their worldly goods and journey to
Edinburgh where they build a small
theatre from a church hall, some bits
of wood and string, lots of enthusiasm
and plenty of skill. It's corny but true.
Meanwhile, they prepare what are
among the best non-professional
shows on the Fringe.
As the church hall is at the West
end of Prince's Street (Edinburgh's
main shopping street) the venue is
known as Theatre West End, or
T W E . About three of the T W E
productions are put on by Beit
Theatre, Dramsoc's Edinburgh alter
ego. The other slots are sold to
professional and amateur performers
and companies. Dramsoc members
run the box office and often the lights,
sound and 'front of house' (ticket
collection and ushering) too. The
whole venue is the responsibility of
another Dramsoc stalwart, the T W E
administrator. Each year the
administrator heads for Edinburgh a
happy-go-lucky person and returns,
after a string of nervous breakdowns,
grey-haired and shaking. Ask any
Dramsoc person 'Why?' and they are
lost for words. For most, it's a chance
to become another person for four
weeks each year: to master the art of
being Someone rather than someone.
But Edinburgh isn't just for those
who create: it's for anyone who can't
afford the airfare to every capital of
the World. It's the only place where
you can sample a Russian version of
Hamlet or a Japanese mime or the
brilliant Thunderbirds FA B! You can
stay for a week and watch four plays
a day or for the full three weeks and
sample maybe one or two a day.
Go to Edinburgh for the culture, for
the atmosphere, for the music—but
don't go for the weather!
