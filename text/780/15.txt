GUIDE
• First of a series of three Stephen
King 'horror' films starts on BBC1
at 9.10pm Saturday, with The Dead
Zone. Johnny Smith awakes from a
5 year sleep to discover he has visions
of the past, present and, most
frightening, the future. A n unnerving
film by all accounts, but keep your
concentration on the plot.
compulsive and even innovative, a
rare feature nowadays on the telly.
• Sports fans can switch to B B C 2 ,
with more Murray Walkerisms in the
Mexican Grand Prix. For those not
following such matters, Britains Nigel
Mansell needs to win this one toSfay
in the race for the World
Championships.
• Groan of the week, Noel Edmonds
returns to our screens with a new
series; Whatever Next, with various
random members of the public
guessing what will happen next in
various situations. If you can tell the
colour of people's underwear by their
actions, this, we are told, is for you.
Minder), Wednesday 6.00pm BBC2
sees The Pure Hell of...The plot: The
girls burn down the school, and are
in the Old Bailey. The 'most subtle'
of the St Trinians films—I can't wait!
• Finally, after collating F E L I X on
Thursday, 11pm, Thames sees
another 'new series' called 01-For
London. Tacky or what? It explores
music, fashion, arts and entertainment
in London. ' A critical guide to what's
on offer in London' is the billing; a
good idea that has failed in the
past—11pm is an interesting time slot.
A sort of video-Time Out.
• That's all for this week on the box,
just as you settle into your working
schedule. Don't forget that it's not all
work and no play, and there are
usually far better things to do than
watch telly.

sport this week, with Baseball,

• Alternatively, you could tune your
radio to Radio 4, and catch the
Saturday feature at 10.15pm; A Germ
is Born, a musical fantasy by Joe
Griffiths. Deep in the bowls of an old
country house is a laboratory. Here,
amongst the cages of hamsters and
and chicken pox, a germ is born. It's
dilemma: to be, or not to be, evil.
• A good night on Sunday for the
Beeb. A new series of Everyman
starts at 10.20pm, with a TV Essay
by reporter Michael Buerk of his four
years in South Africa. Billed as
showing "what it's really like to live
and work on the edge of a racial
battleground", you can see what the
South African censor cut out.
• F o l l o w i n g that, at 11.05pm
(BBC1), we have part two of Robert
Powell's Welcome to my World. A
chilling and very stylish forward look
into the computer age. Last week's
was excellent; and this week he
considers a computer dominated
society, where files are kept on
everybody from birth to death, and
politics is the business of electronic
engineers. Well so reads the blurb;
worth a watch, whether you agree
with him or not, the style is

Sunday (C4) and 6.00pm Tuesday
(C4), I'm hooked, despite all the
statistics!

IC Boat Club members, with
coverage on Wednesday at 11.50pm
(C4) of the Westminster Serpentine
Regatta, to be recorded this weekend
in Hyde Park, Sources tell me that IC
have an 'outside chance' of winning!
