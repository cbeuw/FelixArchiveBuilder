STELLA GODFREY:
NEXT YEAR'S
ICWA PRESIDENT
L A S T T U E S D A Y lunchtime saw the ICWA elections being
held in the ICWA lounge. T h i s years all-round dearth of c a n d i -
dates within I C U struck again. However the situation was some
what the reverse of I C U : there were three candidates for the
post of ICWA President while the posts of D P , Hon. S e c . and
H o n . J u n . Treasurer were un-
opposed.
The candidates for P r e s i -
dent were: Kathy C o n l o n ,
Stella Godfrey, and Sue T a n -
ner. The TCWA lounge was
crowded for the actual voting
and once this was over, there
was a tense wait before it was
announced that Stella Godfrey
c o l l e c t e d the most votes with
the actual result being very
c l o s e .
So next year's ICWA E x e c -
utive w i l l be:
President: Stella Godfrey
' P h y s i c s )
Dep . Pres: Dani Salvadori
( P h y s i c s )
Hon. Sec: A l i s o n Halstead
( P h y s i c s )
Hon. Jun. Treas.: Isobel Don-
nelly (Zoology)
Stella has been active this
year as Rag secretary which
involved organising meetings,
events and taking minutes at
meetings. The job also brought
her into contact with the R e -
fectory Manager and the Dom-
e s t i c Bursar in College B l o c k .
She reputes the rumour that
she was r
' p u t u p " by the Wo-
men in Science Group although
she is neverthelesss a member
of the group and advocates
most of its p o l i c i e s . Stella
aims to create greater aware-
ness amongst the women in
the college in respect of a
variety of topics including the
difficulties many women en-
counter when trying to get i n -
dustrial sponsorship or simply
getting a job. One of her major
aims is to attract more women
to I C .
T h i s is nothing p o l i t i c a l or
antagonistic about Stella G o d -
frey. Her approach to the
whole ethos of ICWA w i l l be
one of expansion, not one of
substitution or dramatic
change of emphasis. The soc-
i a l events are to receive more
attention as regards improve-
ment.
One of her more concrete
ideas is to make the ICWA
lounge into a kind of daily
Angela Aughwaine is in
Maths I and comes from
Birmingham. She is a keen
darts player and when in
oen of her more energetic
moods she also plays net-
ball. Angela enjoys social-
ising and took part in the
RCSU sketch for the Guilds
Revue. She says that she
enjoys the life at IC.

common room with newspapers,
magazines and a coffee mach-
ine. Would men be barred from
this? " C e r t a i n l y n o t , " she
says, " b u t naturally, if we
find that the place i s simply
packed out with men every day
of the week then we would
probably have to reconsider
the p o s i t i o n " . Sounds fair
enough.
Other ideas that she hopes
to implement next year include
co-ordinating flat-sharing so
that g i r l s who find themselves
without accommodation can be
fitted into a flat; an ICWA
Debating Society; p o s s i b l y a

idea i s , as" yet, s t i l l in the
embryo stage ('scuse the pun).
Stella Godfrey is clearly
