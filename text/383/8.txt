F E L I X S P O R T
S O C C E R
With the season drawing to
a close I C F o o t b a l l C l u b can
look back with some satisfac-
tion on a year of moderate suc-
c e s s . F o r the second consec-
utive season no trophies were
collected by any of the teams
but the 2nd X I reached the fin-
al of the reserves cup only to
be beaten 2-0 by U C II's, and
the first X I were runners up in
the premier d i v i s i o n to R o y a l
H o l l o w a y . In spite of this sad
lack of glory the standard of
first team football in particul-
ar has been very high and to
come second in a league
which i s more competitive now
than it has been for a long
time i s a fine achievement in
itself.
The second X I also on their
day were an outstanding s i d e .
T h i s they proved last F e b -
ruary when they annilulated
the eventual league and cup
winners U C I P s 3-0. It i s un-
fortunate that they took such a
long time to find a settled
team and by the time they had
the league title was already
out of their grasp.
A s for the lower teams the
season was most dissappoint-
Tng i n terms of games w o n .
The third X I plagued by injury
started well and even defeated
the second team i n a league,
match, but a certain amount of
apathy combined with injuries
and the elimination of their
captain Roger Hunter put paid
to their chances of any league
or cup s u c c e s s . K e n C o w a n ' s
4th team battled bravely throu-
ghout the season and although
they won only a handful of
games the standard of play
was again fairly good. Too
often, however, the team w a s
let down by a lack of fitness,
something it i s hoped that w i l l
be remedied next season. The
fifths had a good season and
what they lacked of fitness,
something it i s hoped that w i l l
be remedied next season. T h e
fifths had a good season and
what they lacked in s k i l l they
made up for with enthusiasm
which was borne out by them
reaching the semi finals of the
lower reserves c u p . The sixths
had an abysmal year and w i l l
be relegated. Nevertheless a l l
credit must be given to those
lads who turned out week after
week to suffer some heavy
defeats.
Clean Sweep For
IC Water Polo
- I C I and I C II have swept the board i n the U L U winter water
polo league, the first team retaining their title (of the I st d i v i -
sion) and the second team making a dramatic rise from bottom of
the second d i v i s i o n to the top.
IC Ists had very little opposi-
tion, except a strong London
team against whom we lost one
and won one. T h e s u c c e s s of
the team i s due to the strength
of the forwards L e w i s , H i n d l e ,
Freeze, and Smith (all in the
U L U first team as well), the
two strong backs Taylor a n d
Lowther, and a brilliant d i s -
play of goal keeping by I l i c -
a l s o i n die first team.
The second team had a full
eleven plus extras. Special
credit must be given to s p i r i t -
ed performances by Vaughan,
Phaedon, and M.Said, the top
scorer in the whole of the U L U
league.
The s u c c e s s of this year's
second team reflects on the
strength in the club and it i s
hoped that many second team
members w i l l move up to the
first team next year.
F i n a l l y s p e c i a l mention
must be made to our interna-
tional coach and trainer, C .
Spooner, without whose v a l -
uable assistance the teamwork
and s k i l l of play would be so
limited.
Ist team: D.llic, P Hindle,
P.Frieze, A.Smith, M.Taylor,
R.Lewis, D.Lowther.
2nd team: 1.Bales, Angelos,
l.Paterson, D.Mulroney, Lim,
R.Tohiacheusky, W.Gunardine,
M.Said, C.Beavan, T.Vaughan,
R.Simitovic, A.Slight.

L a s t Wednesday, the annual 3mile race was held at the West
London Stadium. T h e race was run over 5000m - the metric equi-
valent of 3 miles on a well beaten-tartan track. T h e back straight
of the track had a cold wind blowing straight i n the runners
faces, and the half inch of water on some parts of the lower bend
did not help them either.
The race started promptly
at two-thirty, with Tractor
Houlbrooke somewhat injured
by earlier road relays taking
the times. After the first lap,
Dave Jones had pulled out a
formidable lead, which was
slowly whittled away by P a u l ,
Rob and Hank .After the fourth
lap a distinct feeling o d deja
vu had crept into the team and
the boredom of running round a
flat c i r c l e became apparent.
The crace, and i t s cup,
was won by R o b A l l i n s o n in
15-32 with Hank Marvin com-
ing i n second, w e l l ahead of
P a u l C l a r k e .
The B a r Race was w o n , for
the third year running by our
Bar star, P a d Donnelly i n a
record time of 51.0 seconds,
this year, however, he was
given a run for h i s money by
our resident three man lift ex-
pert B o b Ignaciuk who sup-
rised everyone by recording a
time of 57.6 s e e s .
L a s t Saturday, the I C team
met the o l d rivals or the O l d
Imperial College C r o s s - C o u n -
try T e a m . T h e start was de-
layed by lack of transport
from I C to Richmond Park and
even when the extras caught a
bus, they failed to get off it
at the right s t o p . T h e course
round Richmond Park felt as
if it had been raining for years
continuously. Why else would
sandy tracks turn into q u a s i -
swamps? Anyway less of this
self-pity and on with the r a c e -
Barry Dabrowski won it, with
Rob A l l i n s o n in second place
and Dave Houlbrooke and P a d
Donnelly ran personal worsts
of 47.39 round a 5'4 mile
course. The young Imperial
C o l l e g e team just beat the O l d
I C ' s by a mere three points.
We hope to improve this score-
line next year to the thrashing
the O l d I C ' s deserve.
B y running in both these
races, and many more, Mike
Welford won the Petersham
Pot, just beating seven or
eight people by only one
match.
PS. Mr Ellis has been getting
advice from Mr Payne on
iridiology.
Bedford Head
The Bedford Head of the
Great Ouse race to give it i t ' s
full title w a s held on Saturday
the 8 th. The course was short
for a head race (2067 m to be
precise) and the times were
fast due to the fast stream.
The processing of the times
was done by computer to give
the results as q u i c k l y as pos-
sible which was fine except
for the slight detail that it got
them wrong. According to the
computer St Ives Rowing C l u b
came first, pretty good going
since they hit the bank during
the race .It also put Ocwridle
School 3rdVIII in third place
which was only 14 places
ahead of their IstVIII! Since
it w a s impossible to overtake
during the first half of the
course the 1st VIII decided to
start with a large gap between
us and the crew in front (Chur-
c h i l l College Cambridge). B y
the end of the race we had
caught up by about s i x lengths,
however the final results put
us only s i x seconds ahead
which implies that we were
travelling at over 40mph! Off-
i c i a l l y the results were as
follows:- l s t VIII 6th (more
likely 3rd or 4th), 2nd VIII
34th, Novice VIII 59th, L a d i e s
73rd.
Kingston Head
T h i s took place on Satur-
day 15th. T h i s time the course
was much longer (about 4
miles). Again the conditions
and times were very fast due
to a weeks rain, in fact the â€¢
current was so fast that the
finish had to be moved 300 m
upstream to avoid exhausted
crews disappearing over T e d -
dington Weir. Despite being a
bit untidy the l s t VIII had a
good row, overtaking three
crews before the finish and
coming in with the seventh
fastest time, behind, Iris (Ox-
ford II), U L I , Poplar B l a c k -
wall R C I , Thames Tradesmen,
Kingston R C I and Bedford R C I .
Since Kingston were late for
the start they were given a
ten second penalty and we
moved up to 6th p l a c e .
The second VIII were un-
able to row because an axel
broke on one of their seats on
the way up to the start.
Our next event i s the Tide-
way Head of the River R a c e
which takes place this Satur-
day afternoon. With over 200
eights racing from Mortlake to
Putney it i s quite a spectac-
ular sight. If you are s t i l l
around your support would be
welcomed.
