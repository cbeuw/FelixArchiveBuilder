T H E E A S T E R vacation is now upon
us and for many it is a very welcome
respite from their academic labours: a
breathing period in which those problem
sheets and project reports which are
s t i l l outstanding can be finally tackled
and then l a i d to rest without the d i s -
traction of lectures, lab periods etc.
But for a handful of students who are
distributed throughout the country, the
vac w i l l prove to be a time for bold
rhetoric, fourious nail-biting and subtle
wheeling and dealing as their mettle
comes under close scruting. F o r i t is
a the E a s t e r Conference at Llandudno
A p r i l 7th - 11th that the elections for
the N a t i o n a l Union of Students E x e c u -
tive w i l l take place. Only those dele-
gates elected from each member stud-
ents' union w i l l be entitled to vote.
T h i s year the Broad L e f t ' s on the
NUS E x e c i s being challenged by " m o d -
e r a t e s " who believe the N U S should be
more democratic in their elections by
having a nation-wide secret-ballot.
This, they believe, would make NUS
truly representative of the students of
this country .
The Broad Left, in reply, have said
that a nation-wide ballot would be too
vulnerable to rich students, for example,
who might try to buy their way to power
with expensive publicity. Anyway, they
continue, the NUS has been developed
as a federal institution with delegates
elected from each constituent organisa-
tion to help decide p o l i c y at conferenc-
es - it should stay that way.
Thus a controversy rages, and, as
in a l l good controversies, different s o l -
utions emerge depending on which part-
icular criterion for resolution happens
to take your fancy at any given moment.
It is perhaps unfortunate that Nega-
tive Democracy (ie "because the peop-
le do not object to this view, then it is
clearly what they really want") can
only be beaten by active participation,
because, considering the state of stu-
dent apathy, the latter is a non-starter.
I believe the only way in which the
question of genuine representation can
ever be resolved is to hold a nation-
wide referendum. This would leave no
doubts in anyone's minds as to what
the students in this country want. Only
those who would expect to lose some-
thing in a referendum would totally re-
ject the idea.

Dear Sir,
May I congratualte M e s s r s .
Seal, Scott, North and Wilkin-
son on their contribution to
Science in describing so a c c u -
rately the attitudes of that
waning species, the 'Male
C h a u v i n i s t Pt.g' ? ( F E L I X , N o .
382).
T h i s information may re-
solve the current dissent exist-
ing amongst Zoologists as to
whether the species is act-
ually a surviving ancestor of
'HomoSapiens' or simply a
sub-species of the ape .
Yours sincerely

Dear Mike
Thank you for the report on
"The RCS Monopoly Treasure
Hunt" published in the l a s t
F E L I X . However I must make
two comments:
1) 'Monopoly' is a registered
trade mark of John Waddington
L t d and, acknowledgement of
this fact in a l l written mater-
i a l was one of the conditions
of being allowed to use it.
2) The person who helped me
organise the stunt was, in
fact, J a n Vincent, and not as
was reported.
Yours sincerely,
Martin K e s s l e r

A t 4.45pm on Wednesday
5th March, several residents
of T i z a r d H a l l , h e l d the ann-
ual orphas party i n Southside
lower refectory. About fifty
children who came from homes
in C h e l s e a and Battersea,
rapidly finished the excellent
food, and set to work provok-
ing the patient organism with
party w h i s t l e s . Naturally the
organisers rose to the bait and
displayed their hidden c h i l d -
ish i n s t i n c t s . However, the
party was not as rowdy as last
year and both the children and
the organisers considered it to
be a s u c c e s s .
