Duane All man: An Anthology Volume II.
(Capricorn)
F O R T H O S E who have heard volume
I, this is pretty s i m i l a r , though perhaps a
bit more varied. F o r those who have not,
it is a double album's worth of other art-
ists' tracks on w h i c h Duane Allman plays
guitar or dobro — artists ranging from
Delaney & Bonney through Wilson P i c k -
ett to (would you believe?) L u l u . Two
tracks are a c t u a l l y credited to Duane
A l l m a n , and both are previously unre-
leased (is it too irreverant to say 'one
can see why?'), as are four others on the
a l b u m . M y favourite tracks are those on
side 4 by the A l l m a n Brothers Band, fol-
lowed closely by a B o z Scaggs track,
"Waiting for a train", on s i d e 3.
Duane's excellent playing is little in
evidence on many of the tracks, however,
and e s p e c i a l l y as there is often another
guitar player, I feel that the dredging-up
of these old recordings i s not really a
fitting tribute. But for those who may
wish to make a c o l l e c t i o n of anything he
played, this w i l l be a worthwhile asset.

iris Murdoch: The Black Prince
(Penguin).
THIS IS Ms Murdoch's fourteenth
book; although i t ' s the first piece of her
work which I've sampled she already e n -
j oys a considerable reputation as a
writer of Intelligent, Intricate novels,
and I'm sure many of her books are w e l l -
known to some of the people reading
t h i s . 'The Black Prince' refers to the
hero of the story, an aging writer from
whose point of view the book is written;
but it a l s o is a subtle pseudonym for a
rather more etherlal figure, the identity
of whom I am not going to reveal. The
writer becomes involved in an unsettled
love affair In which the eternal triangle
Is expanded into a pentagon; and yet
even when everything appears settled a
startling event occurs which throws the
apparent s i m p l i c i t y of the preceding
story into an entirely different perspec-
tive altogether, and we are left undecided
on the sub|ect of the writer's honesty
and, more to the point, s a n i t y . 1 wouldn't
advise reading It If you're feeling de-
pressed as Its a very melancholy book,
but otherwise I can recommend it.

Brindsley le poer-Trench: Mysterious
Visitors (Pan)
B R I N D S L E Y le poer-Trench tries to
cover everything remotely concerning
U . F . O . ' s (Unidentified F l y i n g Objects),
in one book s o begins at a disadvantage.
He firmly believes in A l i e n v i s i t i n g
Earth, Telepathy, Teleportation, Moon
Boxes, A l i e n Mind Influence and genetic
breeding with human beings. He makes
what is to my mind a tactical error in a
book trying to prove something; of assert-
ing these 'facts' first then finding ' e v i d -
ence'. A l l unexplainable events thus be-
come evidence.
Beginning with the U S A F Condon
Report on U F O ' s which he alleges is a
CIA cover-up of the facts, the book then
tends to the para-psychological, with
human beings meeting a l i e n s , visionary
experiences, psychic phenomena e t c .
Even a sumise that the "Younger Gener-
ation" is a mixed race of Aliens/Humans
interbred somehow.
Here my brain becomes confused by
A l i e n Influences, Good for breaking the
ice at parties.
James Wei lard: The Search for Lost
Worlds (Pan)
The factual basis for A t l a n t i s , Eden,
the Queen of Sheba, The Amazons, The
Casoiterides (Britain), and Avalon are
a l l w e l l researched and the facts clearly
given. The B i b l e , Sumerian, Egyptian,
and Greek stories and myths a l l being
drawn upon to get at the true history.
The age-old story of A t l a n t i s seems
finally put to rest by the Archaeological
and Geological evidence corresponding
to a krakatoa like explosion which occur-
ed about 1500 B C devasting the Eastern
Medlteranean region for hundreds of
square mi les.
A l s o the land of the folded Prester
John, which w a s the biggest hoax of a l l
time, provoking exploratory missions of
Marco Polo, V a s c o de Gama and others,
all started by an incredible (In many ways
ways!) letter written to the Roman and
Byzantine Emperors of the time. They
apparently believed in h i s 3000 wives,
and court of 30,000 (all eating at one
table) e t c . A book to hold your interest
throughout.

The 4th Armada Crossword Book.
Compiled by Robert Newton
CROSSWORD puzzles for beginners
(or children, for whom it is really intend-
ed). One hundred small crosswords with
mainly straight definition c l u e s . A
novelty is that they are 'starwords' —
several squares in each puzzle are star-
red, and when complete, the letters in
these squares can be arranged anagrama-
tically to give the answer to an addition-
al clue ~ o c c a s i o n a l l y a help to comple-
tion.
One c r i t i c i s m i s that although the
clues are generally very simple ( e g . a
jorney in South A f r i c a — answer TREK)
there are a few answers w h i c h most
adults would not know (did you know a
hare's tail is c a l l e d a scut?). S t i l l , you
can always cheat by looking it up in the
answers at the back.

Dramatic Society: The Sport of My Mad
Mother by Ann Jellicoe.
H A V I N G S A M P L E D just the one per-
formance of this play, it is tempting to
curtly d i s m i s s It as a modernish hotch-
potch of half-baked story threads which
fall to c r y s t a l i s e into anything resembl-
ing entertainment. But to do that would
be to adopt a superficial and possibly
snobbish mien, s o let us peer closer at
this deliberately untraditional kind of
play.
The director, Mark Frank, states in
the program that the audience should
' 'have no preconceptions and )ust accept
the sights and sounds according to how
they entertain and perhaas enlighten you".
No advice is given on just how one can
dispense with a lifetime's preconcep-
tions in the amount of time given between
reading the statement and the beginning
of play. A s for the play itself, interest in
the " p l o t " is e s s e n t i a l l y precluded: i n -
terest has to focus on the dialogue and
the juxtaposition of the characters.
Two teddy boys F a k and Cone clearly
live in fear of a rival gang (who never
appear) and exult in feelings of
violence. They are joined by an Ameri-
can, Dean and a young girl, Dodo, and
are dominated by the fierce Greta .
They are inarticulate and express
themselves in disjointed phrases, exclam-
ations and rhythmic quasi-incantations
which are emphasised by Steve, the com-
mentator using a set of percussion i n -
struments.
A s the two ' t e d s ' , Eric Stovell and
Steve Randall come across suitably d i l -
dish although their stances did appear a
little strained at times. Kevin Austin
provided a moral portrayal of Dean and
Karen Willis d i d a fine job a s the path-
etic Dodo w h i l s t Sfeve Grove ably breez-
ed through the part of the indifferent
commentator.
A s Patty, Moira Robinson clearly
showed that she has a wealth of talent
which awaits the right director to ex-
ploit it. Her attempt to appear au fait
with cigarette smoking was a gem .
However, the honours for this produc-
tion must go to Penny Pyke who, as
Greta, displayed a stunning mastery of
approach and delivery which electrified
the audience and put the rest of the cast
to shame.
A t the end of the play, Greta gives
birth to a child and is evidently an emb-
odiment of the Hindu goddess, K a l i . The
epigraph of the play apparently i s , " All
creation is the sport of my Mad Mother,
Kali" - profound symbolism indeed.
In c o n c l u s i o n , let it be said that this
production is indeed an ambitious one.
Dramsoc have managed to pull it off -
just.
