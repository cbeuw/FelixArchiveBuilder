4 FELIX
BRIGHTON TRIP '75
By Colin Andrew
T H E A N N U A L RSM trip to the seaside at Brighton has a l -
ways been an event the P o l i c e of this district have viewed with
some trepidation. T h i s year was to be no exception. The trip
started in the 'Queens' after the elections at about 2.00pm, the
President elect, Mr Brayshaw reputedly 'getting a dozen gins
down his neck'. T h e 53 mem-
bers of the merry band then
trooped back to Mines to board
the coach and to quench their
thirst with the barrel on board;
within a very short distance
this began to take effect. With
much shouting of "stop the
bus, we want a weewee", the
.driver consented and a long
queue, formed outside Wimble-
don C o u n c i l ' s major tourist
attraction.
Relief was only short lived
as more beer was consumed
along with champagne and a
small amount of food. A g a i n
the driver eventually consent-
ed and a s no urinal was in
sight we lined up against a
fence and 'painted parabolas'
- much to the embarrassment
of school-girls walking past.
T h i s stop saw Mr Brayshaw
attempting to p * * * on a spar-
row at the top of a tree. Board-
ing the coach again the c a l l
came for Mr Brayshaw to zum-
ba which he d i d accordingly
and following this there came
yet another cry for relief, esp-
e c i a l l y from B o b Longman -
"these anti-water retention
pills are killing me". L u c k i l y
this time the driver a l s o was
desperate s o we stopped out-
side a farm, most people
thought the wall was good
enough but the President elect
entered the farm yard and re-
appeared with a muddy add-
ition to h i s trousers.
We eventually reached
Brighton In high spirits at
about 6.30pm and everyone
streamed across the park ( a
few collecting button-holes of
daffodils) to the ' K i n g and
Queens' where most d i s c u s s e d
the strategy for the evening.
Being desperate for food we
set off in search of this pro-
blem, and succeeded In find-
ing chippies, Chinese rest-
aurants and sea-food s t a l l s
(jellied eel doesn't stay down
very seel!). The more exper-
ineced of the merry-makers
then proceded to the ' B o s u n ' s '
in search of what is c o l l o -
q u i a l l y known in Mines, as
Rat Tart. Several pints later a
traumatic discovery was made;-
horror of horrors - there was
no door on the bog. T h i s fin-
ished us at this particular
establishment and people s p l i t
up into smaller groups.
Later in the evening saw
ever s o slightly inebriated
Miners c o a l e s c i n g on the pub
known as ' D r Brighton's.'
T h i s w a s the pub to which
last year we returned two mir-
rors borrowed from here the
year before that, embellished
with small plaques reading
'Stolen and returned by RSM
1974". A t about 10.30pm the
manager decided that he no
longer needed our custom and
some of our band were ejected.
About now, Jamie B e l l was
seen staggering around shout-
ing (In scouse) "Ar yer corn-
in' on a ramp?" T h i s w a s the
battle cry to go borrowing
signs from the sleepy streets
of this quaint town. After last
years fracas with the High
Sherriff of Sussex we had de-
cided to be more selective, s o
restaurants, pubs and the s e a -
front where our prime object-
ive.
However it came to our
notice that Mr Brayshaw, in
keeping with tradition, should
go for a swim, duely he was
escorted down the beach and
thrown into the now icy s e a .
Emerging he w a s courteously
wrapped up in coats and taken
to a nearby shop doorway to

recover. T h i s appeared to be
the meeting place for many of
our band, and out of dark corn-
e m s various criminal types
appeared with strange shapes
under their coats. The coach
eventually arrived and we
trooped on board, N i c k d i s -
covered he had lost his w a l -
let s o the cavalry was sent
out and duly returned s u c c e s s -
fully. A certain member, who
s h a l l remain namelss, left the
coach and hung h i s posterior
over the s e a wall to lessen
his load then turned around
and puked on top of the moun-
tain below.
Boh Longman, not to be
outdone by N i c k Brayshaw,
then decided to go for a swim
voluntarily and had to be car-
ried back on board the coach.
When on the coach he d i d a
marvelous impersonation of a
zombie a s Pat Gorman changed
his dripping clothes. About
11.45 pm we were nearly ready
to set off when the news arriv-
ed that Steve Maw had been
arrested for borrowing street
lamps but was later released.
The coach left at about mid-
night with a good load of
signs.
The trip back, although
uneventful for some, was very
entertaining for those w a t c h -
ing them; Fred Tutcher slept
almost the entire way back.
He was totally unaware of the
pound note rolled up in h i s
mouth, the coins balanced on
his eyelids, and the paper c u p
on h i s head. After a couple of
puke stops we reached Mines
at about 2.45am.
The few who managed to
get in to college the next mor-
ning commented on each others
bleariness but remembered
little of what was a very fine
trip, I think?
MINES REVUE
T H E MINES Revue stormed e n t h u s i a s t i c a l l y into action last
Monday night to present entertainment without recourse to a
stripper, drag artiste or blue films which are a regular feature at
the other C C U revues. In the end, the gamble to forego the hired
help of outside 'entertainers' paid off. F o r although the smoky,
crowded, intimate atmosphere
which tends to prevail in other
revues was m i s s i n g , the effort
and organisation w a s II there
to ensure that whatever hap-
pened this year Mines Revue
Is established on a firm foot-
ing a s an annual event.
True, the vast majority of
those appearing in the s k e t c h -
es have had practically no pre-
vious experience of revues
and this aspect was manifest-
e d in the hesitation and uncer-
tainty which characterised
some of the first-half s k e t c h -
e s . Nevertheless, valuable
lessons have been learned.
The Revue gathered momentum
a s it went along and there
were some excellent ideas
which had clear potential - the
only things really lacking
were punchlines which are the
essence of a good finish to a
s k e t c h .
In conclusion it must be
s a i d that w h i l s t this event
was a good revue but not a
great revue, it must be quite
clear to Mines that with so
much potential having been
exposed on that night, the out-
look for next year must be
very encouraging indeed.
