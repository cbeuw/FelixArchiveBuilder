A S M A N Y readers of F E L I X may be unaware of the greatest
revelation In the history of human thought, I feel it my duty to
expound the a c t i v i t i e s of the official Wizard of the University of
New South Wales, and to delight your readers with news of his
amazing cosmological discoveries.
Ian Brachenburg Channel!,
BA Hons Sociology and P s y -
chology (Leeds 1963) - was
officially appointed Wizard to
the University of New South
Wales in 1969. In 1971 he set
up the "Wizards Cosmological
Research and Development
Centre' in the Department of
Levity at the University of
Melbourne - to which he has
since been made offical C o s m -
ologer.
Many years of intense i n -
tellectual activity have en-
abled the Wizard, ably a s s i s t -
ed by theoretical physicist
Derek C . B a n k s , to put forward
a new working model of the
Universe - the "Complete
Revised Post-Modern Cosmol-
ogy" • which is essentially
a new synthesis of physical
and meta physical laws.
To verify the validity of
this New Cosmology the Wiz-
ard is preparing for T H E
G R E A T E X P E R I M E N T .
In this experiment the Wiz-
ard, at an exact time in 1975
still to be fixed, w i l l journey
to the Antipodes Island, some
400 miles from N . Z . From this
Island (which is diametrically
opposed to a point off the
French coast) the Wizard, after
a period of merry making, w i l l
levitate into the air and van-
i s h . P a s s i n g through the cen-
tre of the universe (which is
also the centre of levity and
Heaven - a corallary of the
New Cosmology), he w i l l app-
ear triumphant In the English
Channel 42 minutes later. To
prevent his untimely demise a
recovery fleet (including a
yacht from IC) is being pre-
pared to greet him and simult-
aneously raise the level of
levity on the high seas.
Having completed the major
part of his great opus, the Wiz-
ard has been giving greater
attention to the rellgous a s -
pects of the expression of
Cosmological truths. He first
devised a mathematical proof
that he willed himself to be
born at a particular time and
place; and that there coordin-
ates were not, as most modern
cosmologies would have of a
necessarily random nature.
The second major outcome of
the Wizard's investigations
was his acceptance of the role
anrftltle of "Tthe Prophet"
(In the mainstream Israelite
tradition).
A s "The Prophet", the
Wizard sees his main aim as
halting the world-wide religion
of materialist economic pro-
gress, generally timed Inter-
national Socialism or Inter-
national C a p i t a l i s m , depend-
ing on the system by which
the means of production are
legitimated. To achieve this
aim the Wizard Intends to re-
vitalise "The Faith" of the
British peoples in Her Majesty
the Queen, basing this thesis
on the stability resulting from
the balance of power achieved
by the binding by oath of var-
ious legal, religous-philosoph-
ical, executive and represent-
ative institutions in Britain to
the religously legitimated con-
stitutional Monarch. The gov-
ernment resulting from such a
system has proved to be im-
pervious to the manueverings
by materialists in the form of
socialogists, physchologists
and economists, who, with the
help of party politicians and
mass media controllers, busily
attempt to engineer the "voice
of the people" to put them-
selves in positions of com-
plete totalitarian authority.
Our reporter writes: T h o s e
who attended last weeks Wiz-
ard Wellsoc lecture were treat-
ed to a mental trip away from
our normal conception of the
universe, into one in which the
Earth is on the inside of a
sphere, with the rest of the
universe in the central region.
If light travels in a curve, the
physical laws are the same,
and this universe is indisting-
uishable from ours. Whether
the purpose is a serious ex-
periment or an exercise to en-
courage irreverence towards
our a priori universal model
was not clear, but to become a
Wizard devotee is not difficult
and the concepts are fun.
