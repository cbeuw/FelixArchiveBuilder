WEEKS HALL REOPENS
FLOOD 1
I N T H E T O I L E T S O F F
T H E U N I O N B A R
L A S T F R I D A Y there w a s a
Union B a r . Water w a s gushing a l l
let had to be c l o s e d for a period
Now a l l this water y o u
might have expected to run i n -
to the centre of the floor and
down the drain. However due
to the clever design of the
drain (it being at the highest
point of the floor) the water
did the opposite and collected
round the e d g e s .
The obvious course of act-
ion would be to lower the e n -
trance to the drain and this
was i n fact being done when
the flood occured. It appears
that the workmen involved
with the re-positioning of the
drain used an electric drill
which accidentally pierced a
water pipe.
The damage done was not
too extensive and the facility
does appear to be i n working
order now. There were few
complaints except from the,
o c c a s i o n a l murmurings. of the
bar patrons who had to walk
across the lower lounge to the
flood i n the toilets just off the
over the p l a c e , and so the t o i -
other place when nature de-
manded i t .
GUESTS
SMASHED!
40. F R E N C H M E N descend-
ed upOivIC last Friday and un-
fortunately went away" broken
and dejected. Guess who tan
a l l over them on the sports
pitch? England. A ramshackle
I C Rugby team massoacred
them 24-0, then a rampant(?)
U C team finally demolished
them on the football pitch
14-0. It sounds incredible -
more like a rugby socre. Still,
they consoled themselves over
a crate o f w h i s k y .
W E E K S H A L L w i l l be re-opening i n the summer term and
students w i l l be offered places only for the duration of t h i s term.
There i s to be no summer vacation letting i n order that further
structural strengthening work be carried out. T h e progress of this
work w i l l determine whether the hall w i l l be ready again for the
autumn term.
The work to be done w i l l
take approximately twelve
months to complete. If the
work i s started before the
autumn term then the hall w i l l
be out of use for the whole of
the s e s s i o n 1975/6, other-
wise it w i l l be i n use for the
first term of the session only.
T h i s i s due to the fact that
the alternative date of com-
mencing w i l l be Christmas,
1975.
There are stringent condi-
tions attached to this move
which include; the Weeks H a l l
Bar remaining c l o s e d through-
out the summer t e r m . A l l r e s i -
dents w i l l a l s o be expected to
sign an undertaking to the
affect that he w i l l not intro-
duce materials that are l i k e l y
to cause explosions (for e x -
ample, portable gas cylinders).
To this and, the president of
I C U n i o n , Trev P h i l l i p s h a s
been asked to recommend a
number of students who would
co-operate with the Warden to
ensure strict adherence to the
stipulated conditions.
A l l students should receive
a letter from Trev P h i l l i p s
within the next two or three
days o u t l i n i n g the conditions
under which they w i l l be a l l o w -
ed to stay i n the h a l l . Whilst
the next phase of structural
work i s i n progress the hall
w i l l have no occupants resid-
ing there. It i s hoped that
after this second phase the
hall w i l l be safe to accommo-
date students for the following
s e s s i o n .
F L O O D 2
A F L O O D h a s been re-
ported i n one of the basement
storage rooms o f the Union
building which i s u s e d , iron-
i c a l l y enough, by the Under-
water C l u b .
The source of the flooding
was a joint i n a drain-pipe
which i s exposed i n the room.
It i s understood that the joint
blew out under pressure due
to a blockage at the kitchen
end of the frain. A plumber
was c a l l e d and the matter i s
now under control.
Fortunately for the Under-
water C l u b , the storage room
is split-level and so mo^t of
their equipment suffered no
damage whatsoever from the
water.
