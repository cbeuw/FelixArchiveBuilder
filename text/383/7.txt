In order not to draw away the crowds from Twickenham i n the
afternoon, this international match between I C l s t X V and a
P a r i s University k i c k e d off at the crack of dawn namely 11.00am.
IC lost the toss (it i s hoped that more practice w i l l correct this)
and the French elected to play against the w i n d . T h e first twenty
minutes was c l o s e l y contested.
Although breaks were being
made by the threequarters a
lack of f i n i s h i n g deprived I C
from taking the l e a d .
The first I C try came from
good maul ball ten yards from
the F r e n c h line a l l o w i n g R.
Hughes to hive M.Cotter a
very easy try. A t this stage it
become obvious that the e x c e l -
lent line out jumping by M.
Sharrat and K . L i b s c o m e toget-
her with superior mauling and
n i c k i n g by I C would tip the
game i n I C ' s favour.
However what became even
more obvious was that M . C o
ter i n the centre had no intent-
ion of p a s s i n g the ball for the
rest of the game and to say he
hogged the ball i s a vast un-
derstatement. A . W i l l i a m s scor-
ed next and T . F e a r n scored
under the post after a brilliant
individual break from the base
of a scrum on halfway. It was
fortunate that Terry had not
passed to M .Cotter as nobody
would have seen the ball for
the rest of the movement.

p a s s .
Up to now B . B r a d l e y using
iron control had kept relatively
quiet but could now longer
remain silent and managed to
chop or make some comment
on nearly every d e c i s i o n the
referee made. J.Swift had a
couple of good runs down the
wing but this was only poss-
ible by employing moves which
missed out M C o t t e r .
The I C backs found it eas-
ier to cope with the wind d i s -
advantage and after twenty-
five minutes scored another try
by T . F e a r n which Bradley f a i l -
ed to convert. H e even had
some comment to make about
this. In the last ten minutes
the ball found i t s way into M .
Cotters hands. M.Sergot h i s
fellow centre was so despar-
ate at this stage that he even
offered to buy the ball from
Cotter. However even hard
It has come to light that
following the defeat of Im-
perial College by the H u l l U n -
iversity on " U n i v e r s i t y C h a l -
l e n g e " two members of the
H u l l team received a postcard
(postmarked " F o l k s t o n e " )
from a lady who signs herself
" M B E ( M r s ) " .
The text of this postcard
read " . - . W o u l d y o u two
" g i r l s " get your damned hair
cut, before y o u appear again
on " U n i v e r s i t y C h a l l e n g e " .
Y o u are a couple of horrible
hippies, l i k e most of your i l k
you might have supposed
brains but certainty no beauty.
I must say how nice the L o n -
don Team looked certainly a
credit to their university with
their short hair, s u i t s , collars
and t i e s . r m sure one of your
team doesn't even possess a
s h i r t . . "
A genuine communication?
Or does someone here know
something about this?

FENCING CLUB
There were no deaths i n
F e n c i n g c l u b this term. In fact
it has not been a remarkable
term for I C fencing, merely a
good one. Our achievements
can be catagorised into three
catagories: defeats, victories,
and massacres (we doing the
massacring rather than receiv-
ing it).
Defeats, dispite Richards
cash could not prise the ball
from Cotters " a r a l l d i t e " grasp
later created an overlap for R.
C r o s s w e l l on the wing but then
decided to beat the French
fullback by an outside break
thus completely ignoring C r o s -
s w e l l . It was certainly not
C r o s s w e l l ' s day when the re-
feree then went on to d i s a l l o w
a completely good try by him,
which d i d not involve M.Cotter.
B y the l a w of averages M .
Cotter eventually scored i n the
last five minutes to give a
final score.

prove to be a null set. There
was the match against leyton
which was lost 5-4 due to a
bout President who, to quote
our captain " d i d n ' t know h i s

the match against Emany
where J u l i a n had a once-in-a-
decade off day. (Emany i s h i s

Victories included S o b e l l e .
Moving on to the most inter-
esting catagory - M a s s a c r a s .
E a l i n g F a n c i n g club went
down 8-1 thanks to the supurb
fencing of J u l i a n , R i c h a r d and
Lawrence. L a t i s t a F e n c i n g
club were well beaten 12-4,
the afore mentioned trio w i n -
ning a l l their matchs while a
rather unsober K e v i n L a n t o n
had difficulty standing and d i d
w e l l to lose a l l h i s matchs.
Social life was confined to
an attendance at the A C C D i n -

The demise of the Friday night
s o c i a l fencing, due mainly to
a rumour about impending fin-
a l exams c i r c u l a t i n g amongst
the third year members, i s to
be deplored (and we hope re-
medied .)
