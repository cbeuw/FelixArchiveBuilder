DEEP PURPLE AND FRIENDS a critical appreciation
The second I.C. Carnival
Concert held recently before
a capacity crowd heralded
the approach of spring with
temperatures in the nineties.
Was this due to excitation
provided by the performers
or the atmosphere generated
by a small but dedicated
band of smokers? The Or-
gangrinders of the event and
the Domestic Burper eagerly
await your replies, answer
(a) for the former, (b) for
the latter, (c) for Raquel
Welch, and (d) if you would
like to attend D.B.'s confes-
sional held every Thursday
evening in College Block, at
no extra cost.
The concert was started
off by Principal Edwards
Magic Theatre. First im-
pressions were good, here is
something new; the music of
today complemented by vis-
ual images provided by slide
projection and vibrant hum-
an forms. The first numbers
were stimulating but as the
novelty of the event wore
off so the favourable impres-
sion died and one was posi-
tively relieved when the last
note sounded and the last
limb came to inevitable rest.
Though the light show was,
for the most part, good the
music was poor and the
dancing, with a few notice-
able exceptions, was ama-
teurish. A presentation of
the most tremendous poten-
tial which was put over
rather badly; a great idea
that with more polish could
provide entertainment par
excellence.
There followed an explos-
ion, two loin and .lurry car-
toons, and an interval. One
feels it must be pointed out
to the Organgrinders of the
event what a good idea it
might have been if whilst
the audience were watching
that particular Tom and
Jerry cartoon for the twenty
third time they, the Organ-
grinders of the event, might
have been preparing the
stage for the next group.
Alas this was not to be and
an intermission extraordin-
ary was duly enacted.
So at last and finally,
Deep Purple, though seem-
ingly it was only with reluc-
tance that the Organgrinders
of the event dimmed the
house lights. What was un-
doubtedly an excellent per-
formance by Deep Purple
for anyone listening was
spoilt by several splendid
pieces of equipment failure.
During these forced 'breaks'
the lead singer, well-known
for his devastating wit and
amazing repartee, held the
audience in a trance. Apart
from these set-backs the per-
formance was up to Deep
Purple's usual standard, the
lead guitarist excelling.
One thing was very appar-
ent from the evenings enter-
tainment, that Albert Hall
oriented groups do not ap-
preciate what good acous-
tics can do given half a
chance which is what they
certainly did not get. High-
light of the evening; the
end.
Seriously, folks, well worth
a visit next time (wear some-
thing cool and bring some
cotton wool), but please
Organgrinders of the event
let's have the volume down
a bit. Deep Purple on stage

AT I.C.
Cardinal Heenan visited the College to give a general
studies lecture on the role of Christianity in the modern world.
He spent very little time speaking on the subject of the lec-
ture, his main point being that Christians should share the
experience of their faith.
Euthenasia
He touched on several topics and spent much of the lecture
attacking an article by Dennis Potter in the Times. Of more
interest than this was his strong opposition to the idea of
euthanasia which he said the humanist lobby in parliament
was attempting to introduce. He believed that this would
make the doctor an executioner. A s the doctors were under
the control of the state, he maintained that eventually the
state would exterminate not only the old but also the awk-
ward.
Decline
Several questions were put to the Cardinal and he showed
much skill in skating the awkward ones.
He said that he thought that religion was on a decline but
he believed as a Christian that good would triumph over
evil and that religion would survive.

encounter
"Oh, the English", my
Danish table - companion
sighed, "they're so dull, so
conventional, so"—she grop-
ed for the word—"con-form-
ist!"
I sighed in my turn, and
waited for "the Es-tab-lish-
ment".
"Which English?" I prom-
pted.
"Well, I've not been here
long, of course, so I
should really talk only about
those I've met."
"And they were?"
"Students, mostly. Lon-
don students. A lot of sheep!
Why, you can't even tell
them apart—the same cloth-
es, the same hair-do's, and
then, when they open their
mouths, the same opinions."
"Such as?"
"Oh, they all think it
smart to smoke pot and ad-
mire just the latest music
and art; they all talk about
'the Revolution', and"—this
in a crescendo of bitterness
—"they all believe in Free
Love. Why, even you lot did
that!"
I thought of us lot twenty-
five years ago — how un-
utterably boring we must
have been!
"But come", I demured.
"they aren't all like that—
not even Arts students.
Bloomsbury isn't London,
you know, and London's not
England. They're not like
that at Imperial College."
A gleam of hope lit her
eye.

I'll miss out on the scene where
you get killed"
A shot-off gun belt, a
pseudo-rape and two men
fighting against the whole of
The Bolivian Army—perfect
ingredients for a great film
providing that is: if the act-
ing, directing and photo-
graphy are good as well.
And how could it fail with
superbly cool acting of the
now almost middle-aged and
sophisticated Paul Newman.
His roles seem to suit his
age. Remember 'On The
Waterfront' and the young
tough Newman. Today we
have still the tough one, but
he's beginning to use his
brain and to good effect, viz.
his great achievement in dir-
ecting 'Rachel Rachel'. So
much for the ingredients of
'Butch Cassidy and The Sun-
dance Kid'.
Tension
Some of the critics have
compared it to 'Bonnie and
Clyde', but it's really com-
pletely different in approach,
style and setting. This is a
western not a cops and rob-
bers movie. The essential
part is the chase of Butch
and Sundance by a relentless
marshall, an expert Indian
tracker and four of the best
shots in the west. We follow
them through the beautiful
canyons of Utah and we feel
the tension mount, climaxing
in their final jump to free-
dom off a 100 foot high
ledge, to the river below. We
see them in New York and
then in Bolivia and we won-
der if they are going to go
straight.
Poignancy
It sounds corny, but it cer-
tainly isn't. The whole action
is carried out with great at-
tention to detail. The last
scene is extremely poignant
and brings home the futility
of it all and makes one think
that it was a pity they didn't
take their chance when they
had it. The movie is summed
up by Etta Place (Katherine
Ross). "I'll come with you
and do your sewing, I'll cook
for you, but I think I'll miss
out on the scene where you
get killed".
Dialogue
The dialogue is both amus-
ing and witty and the photo-
graphy (Harold Wellman) is
imaginative and attractive.
It's one of the few westerns
in which I have ever felt that
I could be living it. Etta pro-
vides some charming inciden-
tal detail and provides us
with a beautiful and stunning
sequence near the beginning
of the film, when we meet
her for the first time discard-
ing her clothes at gunpoint.
Everyone seems to act well,
but special mention must go
to Paul Newman and Robert
Redford as the Sundance
Kid. They manage to com-
plement each other and so
form a great team under the
direction of George Roy Hill.
Chris Lewis
"Indeed they're not", I
cried, patriotism swelling my
sails. "Believe me, at Imper-
ial College you'd meet
dozens, scores, hundreds of
real individuals, authentic
eccentrics, genuine radicals
even! You would meet people
too indifferent to conventions
to flout them, too old-fash-
ioned to care whether they're
in the fashion or not—people
who actually think it more
important to be right than
with it!"
"Maybe it's the Technolo-
gy that does it", I ventured.
"Maybe, being experimen-
talists themselves, they realise
that experiment means some-
thing more than messing
around to see what happens
—unlike experimental moral-
ists or artists. An engineer,
after all, has standards. If
he builds a bridge and it falls
down next day, he admits
that it was a bad bridge—
he doesn't wait to be applau-
ded for an exciting innova-
tion, expressing the Spirit of
the Time. He doesn't think of
the latest as necessarily the
best."
"Do you mean to say", she
asked, "that Technologists
are more disillusioned than
others?"
"No, not that—because
when people talk of being
'disillusioned', they usually
expect to be pitied. As
though one should pity a per-
son discharged from an asy-
lum for losing the illusion
that he's God! Shouldn't one
rather congratulate him?"
She didn't take that in.
She was gazing dreamily over
my shoulder. Still unconvinc-
ed?
A further explanation oc-
curred to me. "Or perhaps"—
in my weightiest seminar
manner—"it's the Science
that makes the difference.
Scientists, you see, don't so
easily believe in fairy-tales—
and where but in fairy-tales
is the Bad Man invariably
opposed by a Good Man. and
not by another Bad? Tell
your Arts-student that Hitler
or Nixon or Capitalism is the
Giant, and he'll conclude
straight away that Stalin or
Mao or Communism is Jack;
whereas your Scientist—"
But what her Scientist
would do she was never to
learn—at least not from me.
Abruptly, there was an ex-
tinction of lights, a quaking
of walls and ceiling. Techno-
logically perfected down to
its minutest coil, scientifically
amplified to the farthest re-
cess of the cafe, the juxe-box
behind me burst into dread-
ful ululation, and my table
was deserted. All I could
make out in the prancing)
darkness was blonde locks
mingled with black, and
somewhere—as the Rolling
Stones gathered breath for
their second onslaught — a
broken sigh: "The Danes!
Oh, the Danes, they are so
con-form-ist..."
