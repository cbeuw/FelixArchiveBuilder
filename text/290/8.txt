Carnival Hitch
The results of the phantas-
magofical Carnival hitch-
hiking race round the capi-
tals of Britain are still a bit
dubious, but the winning
time is tentatively put at 51
hours 20 minutes, by Steve
Bugg.
Hikers from each of the
three Colleges set off early
on Friday the 13th, and one
is led to believe that all re-
turned sometimes between
the following Sunday and
Wednesday, though one hiker
from Guilds has not been
seen since.
Steve Bugg, racing to catch
the ferry to Ireland, man-
aged the London - Cardiff -
Edinburgh - Glasgow
Stranraer whistle-stop tour in
an incredible 23 hours, re-
turning via Larne, Belfast,
Dublin and Holyhead to ar-
rive in South Kensington
bouncing with energy (!) on
Sunday morning. John Mc-
Cullough, who organised the
race, was second in 57 hours,
59 minutes, after spending
Saturday night in the hospi-
tality of Endinburgh police
cells.
The main Carnival collec-
tion this term was held in
High Street, Kensington last
Saturday, with the backing
of the Splinter group (cour-
tesy of Jazz Club). This col-
lection was totally legal, and
the brave few, who ventured
out in the Arctic conditions,
collected a good £80.
The last event of the term,
staged for your delight, will
be a James Bond film on
March 19th, replacing the
late lamented Carnival Con-
cert No. 2, which was unfor-
tunately sat upon by a rather
large showbiz enterprise.
Our final plea is for strong
and willing legs—preferably
with bodies attached—for the
next hitch-hiking competi-
tion, to be held on March
13th. See posters for details
and entrants can register with
Mike Halhead in the Carni-
val Office, or through year
reps.
Amazing Deputy
Candidates . . .
Roger Phillips
Tony Kirkham
Andy Ward
Roger Phillips is a second
year Elec. Eng. student, who
is, among other positions,
serving as U S K co-ordinator
on the External Affairs
Committee.
He believes that the Dep-
uty President is, above all, a
diplomat, who must be cap-
able of working alongside a
great variety of people, as
well as making decisions in-
depenently. It is his aim to
make the office more out-
ward looking, and to encour-
age closer links with the
ouside world.
Tony Kirkham, a third
year physicist, is well known
around I.C. for his long asso-
ciation with F E L I X . He has
held practically every post
on the newspaper, and this
has enabled him to fully
appreciate the running of the
Union.
Tony feels most strongly
that the Deputy President's
job is not a political one, al-
though Tony has views on
most aspects of Union pol-
icy. He feels capable of co-
operating with any of the
presidential candidates.
Andy Ward (Civil 2) is a
departmental rep. on I.C. and
as such has gained valuable
experience essential for an
officer of the Union.
He believes that important
decisions are not made by on
the spot judgement but only
after rational diccussion with
well informed people. The
Deputy President must be
able to discuss important
Union business with staff,
administration, other stud-
ents, or his President. He
fully supports U.S.K. but
feels that the administration
difficulties in any such or-
ganisation would be consid-
erable.
LC. storm
to victory
in
Gutteridge
Cup
In heavy conditions I.C.
succeeded in defeating Wool-
wich Polytechnic by 15 points
to nil.
On losing the toss, I.C.
withstood a quick assault by
Woolwich in the first five
minutes. However, with John
Ballard kicking out of de-
fence very well, I.C. managed
to contain them during these
few anxious moments.
The play was reasonably
even until a few minutes be-
fore half-time. From the base
of the scrum, Terry Stephen-
son moved to the blind side,
giving John Ballard time to
pass to Keith Devaney. From
a quick passing movement
Chris Wilson then scored an
excellent try.
At half-time I.C. were
leading by three points to nil.
After a few minutes in the
second half, John Wild, from
full back, kicked ahead and
collected the ball. The loose
play that resulted led to John
Kelly charging down a
Woolwich clearance to score
a well-timed try. In the sixth
minute of the half, Clive
Swinnerton added another
three points from a penalty
for a line out infringement.
After a quarter of an hour,
Woolwich mounted an excit-
ing attack, but l.Cs. cover
defence met the surge with
assurance. Woolwich were
perhaps unlucky not to score
in this period. Woolwich
came back at I.C. in the next
Left to right: Mike Adams, George Widelski and Terry
Stephenson with the amazing cup.
ten minutes. But after five
more minutes I.C. attacked
again, with Kip Conolly kick-
ing forward to coUect the ball
and score the third try. John
Wild, playing very well at
full back, was constantly
kicking ahead to cause
trouble for Woolwich. In the
last minute of the game, John
Ballard gave John Kelly an
inside pass to take him to
the Woolwich line, George
Widelski, following up quick-
ly, forced himself over for
LC's. fourth try.
With these last three points
of the match, I.C. sealed the
victory of a very good Cup
Final. Congratulations to
both sides for providing an
entertaining game.

More Pumps
No charge is made to the
people who "borrow" the
pumps, as they are supplied
free by the breweries. But
obviously there can't be an
unlimited supply and the
breweries begin to stop
when too many go missing.
It seems difficult to believe
that pure absent-mindedness
can account for the loss;
after all, a pump is a pretty
hefty object with attached
C 0 2 cylinders and myriad
tubes for the beer.
The amnesty will last for
quite a while, but further
action will have to be taken
if they are not returned. The
people to suffer will eventu-
ally be the clubs themselves,
as soon there just won't be
any pumps to lend them,
This grave occasion was
held in the dead centre of
College Block a week last
Friday. Four hundred or so
Poltergists attended to wit-
ness the peaceful passing of
Carnival, aided by Colos-
seum, Alan Price and Jeremy
Taylor.
Colosseum played with
spirit to a receptive audience,
an arduous task in a half
empty Great Hall. Jeremy
Taylor was much better than
he is on record; but Alan
Price lacked liveliness—prob-
ably he was overawed by the
occasion—in fact he had just
done a stint at Q E C a few
hours earlier.
As a whole the event pro-
vided first class entertain-
ment for £1 a head, but was
greatly undersubscribed. Per-
haps Julie Driscoll, who was
originally booked instead of
Alan Price, might have
drawn more people: the fact
is that Guilds Ents. incurred
quite a substantial loss
through no fault of their
own, for the organisation and
publicity and entertainment
were all first class.
The loss is even more dis-
couraging when compared
with the amount of effort
which went into the event,
Surely this (and incidentally
the loss t h a R C S Carnival
made), suggests that the
three colleges pool their re-
sources next year to provide
a unique evening's entertain-
ment of this kind.

Reps.
and for secretary
Pete Woods (Physics II) is
at present the Union Welfare
Officer, in which post he has
been concerned with every
aspect of the College.
Pete feels that the need for
a strong secretary, who is
prepared to enforce the
Union Constitution, has been
vividly illustrated at recent
Union meetings. Pete believes
that more could have been
achieved on Diversification
and Representation with a
more tactful and mannerly
approach, as he himself de-
monstrated as a Welfare
Officer.
Geoff Needham writes:—
Although it's natural for
election candidates to make
meaningless and superficial
statements, this year they
seem to have made a deter-
mined effort . . . "Candidate
for the Centre" . . . "more
money for Clubs" . . . "Tact-
ful negotiation". A l l too eas-
ily said. Because I can do no
better in 70 words, I hope
you will read my four policy
statements now in circula-
tion. Otherwise I just hope
someone tells you how effi-
cient I am!

Gliders have new baby
The Eagle coming in to land the right way up.
The Gliding Club soared
into action again on Satur-
day. The weather at Lasham
made the gliding excellent
and there was an expectant
air on the ground. The new
baby, a 430 lb. 40 foot wing-
span German single-seater,
was nearly assembled by the
afternoon and the members
are looking forward to flying
it. The pilots of the tow-
planes work overtime to keep
gliders in the air and since
there are so few members
plenty of flying time is had
by all at a fraction of the
expense you would think, so
do not leave all the fun to
them!
