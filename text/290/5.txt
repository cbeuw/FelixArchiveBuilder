Working on
the Railroad
Railway Research in this
country is undoubtedly the
most advanced in the world,
even including the Japanese
with their futuristic high
speed Tokyo-Osaka service.
The old fashioned railway
dictum "it was good enough
for my father, so it's good
enough for me" no longer
holds sway in these days of
British Rail. There are now
opportunities in railway lab-
oratories all over the country
for honours graduates with
a flair for original thinking,
basic research and for solv-
ing the technical problems
confronting the day to day
running of the railways.
People of all scientific
disciplines are needed. Mech-
anical, civil and electrical
engineers, chemists, physi-
cists and mathematicians.
There are centres at London,
Crewe, Swindon, Glasgow
and the largest of all — the
Railway Technical Centre
at Derby.
RESEARCH
A large proportion of re-
search is directed towards
efficient use of transport
relying on steel wheel run-
ning on steel rail. Two new
and now highly developed
areas of (government sup-
ported) innovation are the
'Advanced Passenger Train'
and the 'Train Control Pro-
ject'.
The advanced train pro-
ject is being designed to uti-
lise existing track, unlike the
Japanese high speed service,
which had special tracks and
alignments built expressly
for this service. Obviously
the British Rail research is
a much more fascinating
practical idea. The work
covers a large field of mech-
anical engineering with
major research being carried
out into vehicle dynamics
both in the laboratory and
out on the track. A new lab-
oratory at Derby will, when
completed, contain a range
of test rigs for experimental
work on the Advanced Pas-
senger Train, and other ve-
hicles.
The train control project
. is concerned with develop-
ing computer aided control
of train movements, includ-
ing scheduling of trains
through busy junctions at
peak periods, even allowing
for traffic disturbances — a
problem which can contain
some 1040 distinct sequences
of train movements! Special
tain borne computers have
been developed to contin-
uously calculate maximum
safe speeds, taking into ac-
count the relevant track and
CHRISTIAN U
N
I
O
N SURVEY . . .
. . . Results
The Christian Union re-
cently held a survey to de-
termine I.C. Students' relig-
ious views. A questionnaire
ot twelve questions asking
views on Christianity, refer-
ring to the Bible, Jesus
Christ etc. was used and a
irandom sample of almost
3% of students was inter-
viewed (i.e. in Common
rooms, departments, places
of residence). The results
show good correlation with
a similar but more restricted
survey conducted five years
ago with a 13% poll.
54% of those questioned
believe there is a god, 16%
are agnostic and 30%
atheist. There was no correla-
tion between belief and Sun-
day school attendance, but
regularity of Church atten-
dance and Bible reading is
affected by, or affects, belief.
It is difficult to distinguish
cause and effect, but the
readers attention is drawn to
Q.7 on ambition. Peoples'
first reactions indicate much
about their character, and it
appears that a belief in God
i.; linked with a real purpose
and meaning to life, viz 36%
of atheists have a trivial or
no main ambition, as com-
pared to 14% believers.
Perhaps most interesting
are inconsistencies in
peoples' beliefs and actions.
A prime example is that, of
those who believe in God
55% attend Church occa-
sionally or less and a similar
number seldom or never read
the Bible. Yet most people
accept that, although not in-
dispensible in themselves,
these are the places where
God does reveal Himself to
men. 'How one becomes a
Christian' and thus what a
Christian really is, brought
a great diversity of opinion.
It was one question few had
considered deeply and some
thought totally irrelevant. It
is interesting that 82% of
people did not think that be-
coming a Christian had any-
thing more to do with Jesus
than perhaps following his
teaching. This is directly
opposed to the Biblical view,
where Jesus is central and
those who believe in H i m are
transformed by Him. Paul
said 'If anyone is in Christ,
he is a new creation'. On the
other hand only 4% of stu-
dents were unsure of the
historicity of Jesus, and a
majority showed a respect
for Him, although many ob-
viously found Him a great
enigma. Many of these re-
garded the Bible as a book
which contains at least some
truth.
As might be expected in
a university, a large propor-
tion of students are still con-
sidering their beliefs, al-
though it is obviously im-
possible to quote exact fig-
ures from the survey. Many
said that they required fur-
ther thought before being
able to answer questions con-
fidently, which might well
explain some apparent incon-
sistencies in opinion.
In conclusion, although
some have thoroughly consid-
ered their standing, many
have not and many answers
simply reflect their upbring-
ing. We would be happy to
discuss any issues this sur-
vey raises and we hope that
people will use College to
think realistically about their
basis of life.
train characteristics. A l l this
type of work covers a wide
range, electrical engineering
science, communication and
control, mathematics, com-
puting and ergonomics.
ENGINEERING
Engineering research pro-
jects range from the study
of fatigue in various mater-
ials to the testing of soils in
the laboratory under dyn-
amic stress conditions. The
fatigue laboratory at Derby
is one of the best equipped
in Europe, with facilities for
applying loads of up to 200
tons. There are also soil-
mechanics, metallurgy, con-
crete and non-destructive
testing laboratories involving
graduate staff in all the dis-
ciplines already mentioned.
In electrical research, a
nun.ber of new investigations
are taking place. Gas-dis-
charge research has led to
the development of a plasma
torch system for improving
wheel-rail adhesion. Com-
puter studies and track trials
are under way to develop
cheaper systems for over-
head electrification. Studies
in special instrumentation
techniques, commutation of
d.c. machines and character-
Some of the main results
are shown in the chart. The
answers to each question
were categorised and the
percentage in each of the
four groups is shown below.
The four groups are atheists
(A), agnostics (Ag), believers
who think God is interested
in them (B), and those who
don't (NB). This last group
is only 8 per cent of the
total and thus not statisti-
cally certain in its anwers,
but they do reflect the incon-
sistencies in one group.
Note: Main question — Do
you believe there is a god"?
No — 30 per cent; Not sure
— 16 per cent; Yes (and
He's interested) — 46 per
cent; Yes (but He's not
interested in me) — 8 per
cent.

There are opportunities here
for electrical engineers,
mathematicians and physi-
cists.
Materials and surface
science projects are under
way investigating, for ex-
ample, conductivity of cer-
amic electrolytes, current
collection systems and cell-
design studies. The use of
model systems of the contact
zone between rail and wheel
is shedding new light on the
stopping and starting of
trains.
SCIENTIFIC SERVICES
A day-to-day service to
other railway departments is
provided by laboratories in
Crewe, Derby, Doncaster,
Glasgow, London and Swin-
don, whose staff undertake
general analytical work,
often allied to quality con-
trol, as well as a 'trouble-
shooting' service. These lab-
oratories are supported by
specialist sections dealing
with pest control at Man-
chester, building materials
and dangerous goods traffic
in London, and plastics in
Derby. There is a central
analytical laboratory equip-
