You, The President, Negotiations and a l l that
Some of the e l e c t i o n candidates are sying that next year they want to 'talk'
and 'negotiate' e t c . , . I don't think people are very c l e a r of what the
candidates.moan, but the implications of what they say are that :
i . This year there has not been 'talk and negotiation* .
i i . The Union has been 'too militant1
„
i i i . The President has been 'too m i l i t a n t 1
.
Well, dealing with these i n turn i . I have spent a very large amountof time
every week of the year t a l k i n g and n e g o t i a t i ;/xth the administration and
have s u c c e s s f u l l y negotiated f o r instance, money f.'. r ICU to j o i n NUS, money
f o r a sabbatical year f o r the President, an increased s a l a r y f o r the Union
Clerk, representation and many and various committees e t c . . . there i s mere
to come! I (Union foe etc).. This negotiating requires a great -leal of
s p e c i a l i s t knowledge and know-how, NUS and other colleges are involved i n
providing information, and the President must know how to get hold of the
information.
Further I arranged f o r , and encouraged, departmental representatives and the
Acadenic A f f a i r s O f f i c e r etc.. to t a l k arid discuss with academic s t a f f . I
have also had discussion meetings with academic s t a f f , even though t h i s
i s not the main job of the President (he has not got time) - the Academic
A f f a i r s o f f i c e r concentrates on i t .
i i , . It i s f o r the Union to decide what i t does •
•
• not f o r the President to
veto i t s discussions - e i t h e r t h i s year or ne::t year!
H i . Anything 'militant' I have suggested t h i s year has always been approved
by Union (or Counci l ) .. .
. . which brings us back to i i , i
Of course the President can i n i t i a t e some action and J have done so. For
instance, i t was my personal d e c i s i o n ( l a t e r applaudec by the Union) to
d i s t r i b u t e copies of the June Doard of Studies rcinuter, wiiich embarrased the
Professors who had spoken strongly against student rep-esentation. I am
c e r t a i n that t h i s a c t i o n g r e a t l y Speeded up the normally very slow discussion
" i n academic c i r c l e s , so the moderate Professors have now spoken and the
Doard of Studies had 'decided t.o decide' on representation instead of deciding
against again* We also furthered the cause of junior s t a f f who are now
better represented on tha Board of Studies, ••cry large I T due to the Union's
e f f o r t s ,
I f we had not d i s t r i b u t e d the embarraring minutes and sc forced a great deal
of p u b l i c d i s c u s s i o n , we and the Junic s t a f f would be vhere we were back i n
June. S i m i l a r successful actions took place t h i s year e.g. Moritorium,
Refectory Boycott. S i m i l a r actions w i l l almost c e r t a i n l y be necessary next
year. So the. Union must have a President with the p o l i t i c a l know-how to be
able to decide when to i n i t i a t e such a c t i v i t y and a c t i o n and how.
This brings me to a general point about community d i s c u s s i o n and n e g o t i a t i o n .
It i s the mark of a healthy community that there i s extensive p u b l i c
d i s c u s s i o n . P u b l i c discussion i n IC i s t h i s year higher than ever before.
This p u b l i c discussion i s e f f e c t i v e l y generated by a c t i o n and a c t i v i t y and
contributes i n an absolutely v i t a l way to the backing of anybody (e.g.
President) involved i n negotiation •
• i t has greatly helped the Union t h i s year.
Next year, i f the Union stops moving, d i s c u ^ i i o n w i l l stop and negotiations
w i l l f a i l .
P o l i t i c i a n The President of the students' union - now a sabbatical post, i s
a highly p o l i t i c a l one - and can never be anything eJse. Members of the
Administration have, generally had about 30 years of p o l i t i c a l experience
( i n administration and organisation of people and p o l i c i e s e t c ) . The
Students Union President must have the p o l i t i c a l knov.'-how and contacts to
e f f e c t i v e l y discuss and negotiate with thenic I have about 4 years of p o l i t i c a l
experience (some of i t outside I.C.) and have found i t very u s e f u l .
