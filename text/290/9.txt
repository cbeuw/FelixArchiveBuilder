Well p u b l i c i s e d rumours that Professor Hayman, professor of Pure
Mathematics at I.C. since the mid 50's, w i l l be the next Head of the Maths
Dept. seem t o have grown without too much basis i n f a c t !
The vacancy has occurred as Prof. Harry Jones, present Head of Maths,
i s t o become Pro-rector i n October and perhaps sooner f o l l o w i n g the death
of Lord Jackson.
Several weeks ago a meeting of the professors i n the Maths dept was
unable t o decide on who should succeed. At a l a t e r meeting with Lord
Penney the idea was mooted of having a 'rotating chairman'(I) of the Maths
dept. w i t h no-one Head of Department, There was apparently some disagreement
over t h i s idea andLord Penney asked that the profs i n d i v i d u a l l y l e t him know
by l e t t e r who they thought should get the post. Prof. Hayman seems not t o
have been the unanimous choice.
Prof. Hayman acted as Head of Dept. i n Prof. Jones absence l a s t year
and has been a t I.C. longer than the other p r o f s i n the Maths dept but h i s
e l e v a t i o n t o greatness no longer seems c e r t a i n .
