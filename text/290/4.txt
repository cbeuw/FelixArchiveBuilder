SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE
Or The Children's Crusade
A duty dance with Death
by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.
A fourth generation German-American now living in easy
circumstances on Cape Cod (and smoking too much), who,
as an American Infantry Scout Hors de Combat, as a prison-
er of War, witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden, Germany
'The Florence of the Elbe', a long time ago, and survived
to tell the tale. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic
schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore,
where the flying saucers come from. Peace.
And this is a review in the telegraphic schizophrenic
manner of the novel. It does not make sense.
Kurt Vonnegut addresses his publisher, Sam : '(The Book)
is so short and jumbled and jangled, Sam, because there is
nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. Everybody is
supposed to be dead, to never say anything or want anything
ever again. Everything is supposed to be very quiet after a
massacre, and it always is, except for the birds.
'And what do the birds say? A l l there is to say about a

SOUTHERN
COMFORT
UNLS 108
Save a few of the big
name groups, Matthews'
Southern Comfort must have
been one of the best acts at
I.C. this term. The only dif-
ference between their appear-
ance here and this record is
the line up, as Ashley Hutch-
ings, Richard Thompson and
Simon Nicol of Fairport Con-
vention are included, as is
Gerry Conway from Sandy
Denny's new group Fother-
gay.
The tracks vary consider-
ably from the country style
tracks penned by producer
Steve Barlby, like "Colorado
Springs Eternal" and "Sweet
Bread" to the only (alas)
Richard Thompson track " A
Commercial Proposition".
This is a very good one which
could have been recorded
better.
Ian has written most of the
tracks—"Please Be M y
Friend" is reminiscent of the
Byrds, but as Ian said "It's
not to be taken seriously".
Gordon Huntley, the steel
guitarist, does full justice to
the tune, while "What We
Say" features the character-
istic guitar playing of Rich-
ard Thompson.

STRAWBS
"DRAGONFLY"
AMLS 970
Whenever I've seen Strawbs
they've been aided by a 'cel-
list, so I'm glad to see that
she (Clare Deniz by name)
has been included on this al-
bum as she is now an intri-
cate part of the group.
The title track, "Dragon-
fly", is used as a symbol to
denote the coming of autumn,
and I can indeed imagine
Dave cloaked in shepherd's
mantle on top of Exmoor
singing T Turned M y Face
to the Wind'.
'Josephine for Better or for
Worse' is a happy-sad song
and is one of the best sung
ones, and in contrast 'Vision
of The Lady of the Lake' is
the epic of the record and
combines part of "Morte
d'Arthur" with some Cousins
fantasy.
None of the tracks have
the immediate impact of 'The
Man Who Called Himself
Jesus', but after a while the
beauty of each track opens
up—just like a dragonfly
opening its wings.

"STORMBRINGER"
ILPS 9113
Judy Collins was one of the
first to get session musicians
to support her, and now a
whole stream of contempor-
ary singers seem to be follow-
ing in her footsteps. Sandy
Denny will be soon, and John
Martin together with his wife
Beverley have done so on this
album.
For Beverley, who used to
sing with a jug band, this is
a record debut—four of the
tracks are penned by her.
"Sweet Honesty" is an orig-
inal blues number and "Can't
get the One I Want" is a
tender ballad (sorry about
the cliche).
I'm sure the finished record
must have been very reward-
ing for both of them.

SLAUGHTERHOUSE
F I V E
massacre, things like ' Poo-tee-weet'?'
In one night Dresden was devastated by Allied bombers,
fighting on the side of Light. The City was destroyed in a
fire storm which killed an estimated 135,000 people. So it
goes.
Billy Pilgrim was a prisoner of war, billeted in a slaughter-
house in Dresden, at the time of the raid. Along with other
prisoners, some guards and a few carcasses, he survived.
He became a rich and famous sight tester and seemed to
forget Dresden. A t the height of his prosperity, so he says,
he was kidnapped by beings from the planet Tralfamadore,
where he was publicly mated (in a zoo) with the lovely Mon-
tana Wildhack, a Hollywood Starlet. On Tralfamadore, he
learnt the truth about time and death. So he says.
'Later on, as a middle-aged opteometrist, he would weep
quietly and privately sometimes, but never make loud, boo-
hooing noises.'
Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. Billy is spastic
in time, he has no control over which part of his life he is
acting. The book follows these jumps, giving it a layered
structure in time, and thus the central theme, Dresden,
barely described as an episode, looms large.
After the slaughter, one of the prisoners, a drafted high-
school teacher, was shot for stealing a tea-pot. So it goes.
The shooting party consisted of only four people, because
so few were left. So it goes.
Billy Pilgrim's son was all screwed up at school. He joined
the Green Berets, and Vietnam straightened him out. So it
goes.
The book is funny and sad, bitter and fatalistic. War hap-
pens, people die. So it goes. Read it. And listen to the birds:
'Poo-tee-weet?'.

C
. and Academic Policy
The Editor,
Felix.
Dear Sir,
May I express my thanks, through your columns, for the
opportunity to speak on I.C.R.C. during the meeting held
Thursday afternoon, 5th March, in the Great Hall, with the
Rector present.
There was one question put from the floor by Mr. Hains,
and it may also worry other students . . . namely would
I.C.R.C. discuss Academic Policy matters. The answer to
this is—if the matter was of general college interest, then
I C R C would be within its terms of reference to discuss it
in a free and frank way, since by definition the matter would
be of interest to all.
I personally cannot think of any such matters. A l l I can
visualise is that the effects of an academic policy could be
brought to I.C.R.C. Let me give an hypothetical case to
indicate my point . . . Suppose it became 'academic policy'
to introduce two shift working for lectures and laboratories,
say from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., and from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
so that two degree courses were running simultaneously. This
would almost certainly be referred to I.C.R.C. to find out
what everybody thought about it!
No—I.C.R.C. will concern itself with matters of general
college interest, such as financing of universities, college
refectories, college democracy and college structure, provi-
sion of college technical services and so on.
Already from its present short existence some good has
emerged, since it has generated a wave of understanding
and support for I.C. students throughout large numbers of
non-academic staff.
Yours sincerely,
H . F A I R B R O T H E R ,
Secretary.
