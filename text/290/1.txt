AFTER SOME WEEKS of behind the scenes negotiations three candidates have now emerged
for the presidency.
AH three have written special articles for FELIX, which appear on pages two and three of this issue, where they ex-
plain the reasons for their candidacy. This is only the second year that the president has been elected by college wide
ballot. The victor also gains a sabbatical year, and it seems likely that the honorary secretary will get one too.

Up to press the cam-
paigns have been pleasantly
notable for their lack of
acrimony; which is perhaps
unsurprising as all three cam-
paigns are based on the
groundwork laid down by
president Piers Corbyn this
year. They have strong, if
somewhat different views on
the everpresent questions of
diversification, representa-
tion, the National Union of
Students and the growing
confrontation with adminis-
tration over the Imperial
College Representative Coun-
cil.
Judith Walker, the first
ever woman to stand for
president at I.C., came here
this year to do a post-gradu-
ate course in materials
science. She was previously
at Westfield College, where
she was on the Union execu-
tive and the N.U.S. secretary.
This year she has been close-
ly involved in I.C. Union,
working on the Academic
Affairs Committee and has
prepared a course unit ques-
tionnaire for London Univer-
isty. Her platform follows
very closely on Piers' lines,
and she should receive the
overwhelming support of the
college left.
Brian Hains, geophysics
post-graduate, has been tied
up in Union Affairs ever
since coming to I.C. One of
the student observers at many
Governing Body meetings,
and on the Finance and Exe-
cutive Committees, he is cer-
tainly as well known and re-
spected by the college ad-
ministration as any other stu-
dent in the college. This ex-
perience, he feels, should be
invaluable in presenting stu-
dent views to the administra-
tion.
John Darley, chairman of
the Athletic Clubs Commit-
tee, is the least political can-
didate. But he thinks this
should not be a drawback.
Although he admits that his
main interests lie in sport,
his work on council this year
on such subjects as Union
Fees and the Quinquennium
policy has sufficiently broad-
ened his outlook to enable
him to cope with all the
problems thrown at the presi-
dent.
For a strong Union, it is
vital that the Officers are
representative of the major-
ity of the Union. All F E L I X
readers are urged to vote in
the ballot on 16th and 17th,
and also to go to the last
Union meeting of term on
the 19th, at which the Wel-
fare, External Affairs, and
Academic Affairs Officers are
elected.

In a letter to the
Union, Lord Penney
stated that is not,
and never has been
College policy to keep
political information on
any student, either cen-
trally, or departmen-
tally."
However, he made it clear
both in his letter, and whilst
speaking at the Union meet-
ing last Thursday, that con-
fidential files should be re-
ceived and treated in con-
fidence, unless the writer
agrees to his letter being
seen by the student con-
cerned.
The discussion on politi-
cal files hardly came up dur-
ing Lord Penney's visitation
among the rank and file of
the Union, most of the time
was spent discussing repre-
sentation on the Board of
Studies (BoSt.). Showing far
more political and debating
acumen than any of our re-
doubtable Union politicians
with the possible exception
of Brian Hains, Penney dis-
missed the idea of actual
student representation on the
Board of Studies, but held
out the tantalising offer of
definitely allowing a reason-
able number of students to
raise matters with the BoSt.
for half an our or so before
their meetings, but to leave
before the BoSt. actually
started discussion.
The BoSt. is the highest
academic body in the col-

lege. Lord Penney would
like to see students and aca-
demic staff in an infrastruc-
ture working on the many
problems arising in the col-
lege, including courses and
diversification. However, the
BoSt, also decides on exam-
ination results, repetition of
exams and the terms and con-
ditions of academic employ-
ment, and on these Lord Pen-
ney is adamant that students
should have no voice. He
also sees no sense in the
notion of the Imperial Col-
lege Representative Coun-
cil (I.C.R.C.) — b e i n g
pushed by both Council and
the Association of Scientific.
Technical and Managerial
Staffs (A.S.T.M.S.).
He feels the I.C.R.C.
would be unrepresentative,
only pultting forward pro-
posals decided by a majority
vote, which disenfranchises
those who disagree with the
vote.
All in all, Lord Penney
'gave the impression r f a
keen interest in student
aspirations and was •dways
willing to consider out ideas.
However, he objects to being
pressurised and maybe feek
that some of Upper Council's
"ultimatums" are trying to
do just this.
Pinched
Pumps
Larceny has struck in the
I.C. bars again. Not glasses
this time, but bigger stuff —
the pumps. Stan Kearns,
Southside Barman and Bren-
dan Clements, his opposite
number in the Union Bar are
both several pumps down but
are willing to declare an
amnesty so they can be re-
turned.
The pumps aren't blatently
knocked off from the bars,
but are lent out to clubs and
societies for their various
functions throughout the col-
lege. Stan reckons to be over
two dozen down, calculated
over several terms of lend-
ing them out. Brendan, in
the Union, is two Tankard
pumps down, one Tartan
pump plus a Tartan cap and
some lights stolen outright.
