Football: I.C. reach finals of U.L. Cup
I.C. 2nds 1, Q.M.C. 2nds 0
On Wednesday, 25th Feb-
ruary, I.C. 2nd X I soccer
team succeeded in beating a
strong Q.M.C. 2nd X I in the
Semifinals of the U . L . Cup.
Played on a heavy, uneven
Q.M.C. pitch before a fero-
cious crowd, the game was
fairly even in the first half.
The strong wind was blowing
Q.M.C.'s way, but they did
not seem to be able to take
advantage of it, despite
strong running by their mid-
field players. I.C. played the
ball rather slow in the first
half, but after half time, with
the wind on their backs, the
game speeded up and play
went more I.C's. way. The
only goal of the match came
from a long through ball
from Ives in defence to Wil-
ley. Strongly challenged by
both the right back and
goalie the ball broke loose
to the right where Ebbutt,
following up, placed the ball
in the back of the net.
Play continued running
I.C's. way and only poor
shooting saved Q.M.C. from
a heavier defeat. However
towards the end Q.M.C.
made several strong attacks
up their right wing, one of
which resulted in them hit-
ting the I.C. crossbar, and it
was with some relief that the
I.C. defence welcomed the
full-time whistle.
I.C. now go on to the final
of the Cup at Motspur Park
on 14th March against Wool-
wich 2nd. It is hoped that
some supporters will travel
with the team for this final
game, which promises to be
a good one.
Team: Barley, Maslin, Lang-
ston, Ives, Ball, Sanderson,
Ebbutt, Willey, Richards,
Bartlett, Parker.

Hockey: I.G.W.A. win Penney Gup
I.C. women's hockey team
brought the Penney Cup back
to I.C. after a year's absence
by beating Q.M.C. 3-2 at
Motspur Park. As the score-
line suggests the match was
was fairly even and, in fact,
extra time had to be played.
In the opening minutes I.C.
attacked strongly but were
unable to score and the first
goal went to Q.M.C. follow-
ing a breakaway. I.C. then
looked less sure of themsel-
ves and it was almost the end
of the first half before they
were able to equalise
through Lynne Beynon.
However Q.M.C. scored
again straight away to leave
I.C. 2-1 down at half-time.
In the second half I.C.
again had most of the play
but seemed unable to equal-
ise until about 5 minutes
from full-time when Sue
Thompson made the score
2-2. This was the score at
the end of normal time so
that extra-time of 10 min-
utes each way had to be play-
ed. The Winning goal came
after Chris Culshaw perse-
vered strongly to score in the

S & G Club in
Snowdonia
Rescue
IC Scout and Guide Club
took part in a dramatic
mountain rescue in Snow-
donia last weekend. Eighteen
club members went off on
one of their regular moun-
tain walking trips on Friday
night. On Saturday morning
they set off in small parties
to attempt the range of
climbs, though high winds
and low clouds made the
going very bad.
It was in the afternoon
that the drama occurred. One
of the IC groups was stop-
ped in the Llanberis Pass and
asked to help in the rescue
of two men badly injured
near the summit of Snowdon.
They helped in the remark-
ably difficult task of man-
handling two stretchers up
the mountain. Whilst doing
this they discovered the bod-
ies of two more victims, an
atomics engineer and his
wife. The IC party came
down at nightfall and return-
ed to the hut where they
were staying. Another party
was rapidly formed to help
in the rescue. This was not
needed, so everyone con-
soled themselves with a few
in the pub across the road.
Editorial
The end of the second term coincides with the end of the season for many athletic
clubs and is the time when clubs weigh up their success and failure. The 'Links' Trophy is
awarded at the end of each year for the club which has achieved the best results bearing
in mind the competition encountered. Strong contenders this year must be I.C.W.S.C.
(who won it last year). They have won the hockey cup and also come high in the
badminton league. The rugby club, are of course, playing in the final of the Gutter-
idge Cup (see back page) and have had one of their finest seasons for some years. The
men's badminton have gone through the season unbeaten and easily top their league.
I often think that it is a pity that the success of a club is often measured on the success
of the first team. This year, for example, the association football club 1st XI were
knocked out of the cup and are likely to finish second in the league. Lower down, how-
ever, the 2nd XI are in with a chance of both their respective league and cup titles and
the 6th XI play in a semi-final replay. This strength in depth is characteristic of many
I.C. clubs and reflects the strong sporting tradition of the College.

Guilds 2,
Guilds haVing beaten Min-
es, faced the holders R.C.S.
in the final match of the
Tech Cup on Sunday, 1st
March. In a hard fought
match, Guilds put up a fine
performance to come out
winners by two goals to nil.
From the start R.C.S. put
Guilds under pressure but
the Guilds defence always
looked sound with S. Boyce
playing well at centre half,
and once the Guilds for-
wards came more into the
game Guilds began to look
the more dangerous side.
R.C.S. could have taken an
early lead with some fine
work by J. Kelly, but it was
left to Jeff Keer, causing a
lot of trouble in the R.C.S.
defence, to score with an op-
portunist shot which was mis-
judged by the goalkeeper.
The second half opened
with some determined at-
tacking by R.C.S. which
kept the Guilds defence busy
but with Keer and Willey
looking dangerous, Guilds
looked more likely to score.
The goal came from a good
run down the line by Peter
Willey, who centred and the
ball ran dangerously across
the area for Mike Knowles
to run into and shoot a fine
goal, sealing the match.
Guilds continued to pressure

the R.C.S. defence and ran
out sound winners. The
Guilds team, containing eight
first years, must be a good
prospect for future years.

After some barren years
the I.C. Boat Club is well on
its way back to the position
of premier college in U . L .
By beating Middlesex Hospi-
tal, last year's winners, and
the U.L. "Tyrian" crew, the
I.C. 1st VIII won this year's
U.L. Head of the River
Race, held over the Boat
Race course, thus regaining
the "Dixon Bowl".
Creditable performances
were made by the other six
I.C. entries, and the Novice
crew stroked by Hayden
Evans was unlucky to lose
its division by 4 seconds over
the 20 minute course. It is
hoped that by the summer
I.C. will have complete dom-
inance in all U.L. divisions.
Earlier this season the 1st
VIII came 3rd in the Peter-
borough Head, out of an
entry of 33 club crews. Since
then all the VIIIs have pro-
gressed in their preparations
for the Head Races at Kings-
ton and Putney, where there
will be strong I.C. entries.
