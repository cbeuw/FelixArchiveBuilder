The "Education Prograrme" on BSC l a s t Sunday comprised a d i s c u s s i o n
i n which the chair pressde the f o l l o w i n g p o i n t s : that there i s a great
anomaly between the" f i n a n c i a l support f o r a student i n a U n i v e r s i t y and f o r
one i n another i n s t i t u t e of higher education, and that t h i s anomaly may be
removed by introducing a " comprehensive " scheme and spending more money
on higher education at the expense of the .Universities,
My answer to t h i s argument i s that..,.
It i s true that more money i s needed f o r non-university higher education
on the grounds that i t caters f o r more students, but NOT at the expense of
U n i v e r s i t y education.
The reasons l i e i n basic economics. The amount of money spent on
educating a student should be related t o the f i n a n c i a l r e t u r n , which may be
measured as a f u n c t i o n o f : -
(a) h i s c o n t r i b u t i o n t o the country i n h i s future employment
(b) h i s c o n t r i b u t i o n to the advancement of technology.
The greatest advances i n research are arade by groups of people with
s i m i l a r s p e c i a l i s t i n t e r e s t s , where expensive equipment may be used with
maximum fcetur on c a p i t a l investment. Should these groups be ' d i l u t e d ' and
u l t i m a t e l y destroyed by a comprehensive system where one i n s t i t u t i o n
comprises many tyoes of college-, research w i l l s u f f e r .
Students are the most able to d i v e r s i f y t h e i r i n t e r e s t s . Instead of
concentrating on t h i s sector, l e s s money could be used t o better advantage
by d i v e r s i f y i n g the i n t e r e s t s of the whole population, while preserving the
acade-wic s p e c i a l i s a t i o n of our uni vers 5 t i&s i
be a more academic and open mass midia system
and more e f f i c i e n t to extend t h i s mode o F d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n t<
concentrate on the sector most able t o broaden I t s i n t e r e t s
