Presidential Candidate JOHN
DARLEY speaks...
John Darley is a third
year maths student and this
year has been chairman of
the Athletic clubs commit-
tee. During the past year he
has been an active member
of council and has contribut-
ed to a number of working
parties including the one
which prepared the Union
Quinquennium policy state-
ment.
This, in particular, has al-
lowed John to get a useful
insight into the problems fac-
ing the students of I.C. and
also into the ways in which
these might be overcome.
With regard to particular
topics of discussion, such as
student representation on col-
lege committees, diversifica-
tion of studies etc. John's
views are generally in line
with I.C.U. policy. He feels
that a great deal of enthusi-
asm has been generated this
year and it is essential that
this is maintained in the
coming year. It would be
tragic, he thinks, if the ideas
and aims of the students
which have appeared this
year, go unfulfilled due to
apathy or lack of interest.
Many people will probably
feel that John's lack of poli-
tical motivation in the col-
lege will hinder him in his
presidential duties. It is true,
of course, that his chief in-
terest has always been in the
sporting rather than political
fields, however, he himself
fels that his having no strong-
ly directed political views will
enable him to consider all the
aspects of any problem un-
biasedly. John thinks that
even more progress could
have been made in the
changes that have come this
year if a willingness, not
necessarily to compromise,
but merely to consider other
points of view had been more
evident.
Diversification
The case for diversification
has been discussed consider-
ably this year but no clear
cut decision of what is need-
ed has been reached. This
is obviously because the
structure of I.C, with its
many different departments,
makes it impossible for a
general policy to be laid
down. The students of some
departments, particularly in
R.S.M., are quite content
with their courses whereas
others, especially in the pure
sciences, strongly feel that a
more diverse course of stud-
ies would be of greater use
to them.
As far as student repre-
sentation on college commit-
tees goes the case can best
be summed-up by two ques-
tions. Are the students on the
committee of use to the com-
mittee? Are the decisions of
the committee of any inter-
est to the student body? If
the answer to these two
questions is yes then there is
obviously a strong case for
student representation on
that particular committee.
Sabbatical
It is obvious by the acti-
vity of the students in the
union that the union is in a
healthy condition. What is
needed next year is a presi-
dent who will maintain this
enthusiasm and use it to
greatest effect to gain stu-
dent aims. John Darley
knows the problems. He will
listen to suggestions from
both sides without bias. He
thinks the introduction of a
sabbatical year has made the
post of president a profes-
sional job and looks on it in
this light.
Paper-Dart
Competition
On Tuesday, March 17th,
at 1.00 p.m. Aero Soc will
be holding the annual Paper
Darts Competition, in aid of
Carnival, from Tizard Hall
gallery. The event is open to
anyone who is capable of
designing, constructing and
launching a dart. The entry
fee is 1/-.
Darts may be constructed
of paper, cardboard, glue
and sellotape only and must
be of a recognised dart
shape.
The winning dart will be
the one which goes furthest,
at right angles, from South
Side. This dart will be care-
fully preserved and the win-
ner's name will do down in
College history.
The winner will receive
half of the money taken, the
other half will be donated
to Carnival.
The dart at present under-
going final tests in the Aero
Hypersonics Lab. is hot fav-
ourite but anything can hap-
pen in the difficult wind con-
ditions around South Side.
Come along and have
some fun. hope to see you
there.

R.C.S.U. Meeting
At 1.15 p.m., 3rd March,
as the volume of background
noise rose to the level it was
to maintain for most of the
meeting, John Butterworth
read the previous minutes
and a letter from Sir Solly
Zuckermann, who will not
be speaking at the R.C.S.
Dinner.
A vote decided that both
the presidential election (P.
Cunningham 23, R. Abdulla
29, P. Sharkey 140, Absten-
tions 116, Spoilt papers 25)
and those for Vice President
and Secretary were invalid,
and, after some argument,
dates for the next election
were announced by Penny
Walters; nomination papers
12 to 18 March, listings 21
April, election 27 April.
There were complaints about
the conduct of the elections;
including bad advertising
and organising and the
With Union elections pend-
ing I would like to express
the views of a poor student
for the consideration of can-
didates.
I would like to see Im-
perial College welded into a
true unit and get rid of the
' them and us' attitude which
is becoming prevalent. If we
can meet the policy makers
and show them that what we
want is reasonable, then I
have no doubt that we will
achieve a lot more than we
would by embarrassing them.
Why do we have to follow
the sheep who think that we
have to fight for everything
before it is worthwhile? I
believe that we could set a
lead to other colleges by
creating a truly equal society
at I.C. — a place where stu-
dents staff and governors are
working together and help-
ing one another. Separatism
can only lead to strife, and
when that happens we will
find ourselves fighting a run-
ning battle where we have
little to gain and a lot to
lose. A good starting point
in a policy of integration is
JURGO. This contains the
Rector, three governors, the
three College Deans, a war-
den and four members of
staff. It also contains the
President and treasurer of
I.C. Union and ten members
of I.C. Union Council. What
better way could there be of
alleged removal of a ballot
box.
A general call for the mas-
cot resulted only in the
lights being dimmed for
fighting, but eventually N .
Powell was carried to the
front, to say that he had
mislaid Theta. During a brief
lull in the ensuing flood of
suggestions, it was noticed
that the meeting had passed
to the next business, a mo-
tion condemning obscene
language at Union meetings,
many examples of which
were provided from the floor
to assist the proposer, but
he successfully interrupted
them with considerable vocal
power. There followed an
academic discussion on
vocabulary definitions by P.
Ferndale and B. Pywell, and,
at 2.00 p.m., the meeting fin-
ally faded out with two
Kangelas.
getting things done than to
discuss them with the people
who in the end will imple-
ment them?
Union meetings have met
with a lot of criticism lately
and I would propose that
they be conducted in a more
ordered fashion. They should
be started punctually and
should have A T LEAST the
President and Secretary of
the Union as well as the
three constituent College
Presidents in attendance,
with as many members of
Council as possible. Meet-
ings should discuss subjects
which are of direct interest
to the majority of students,
because if I.C. students don't
participate in their own
Union they wfll never be
given the opportunity to par-
ticipate in running academic
affairs. In other words, let's
draw more students and less
external politics into Union
meetings. Fewer meetings
might make people take
more notice when they did
arise provided that informa-
tion on current trends could
be efficiently disseminated.
Perhaps it would be possible
to set up a regular Union
newsheet for this purpose
with established College
newspapers running articles
on the more important topics
which arise.
People — not politics.
Let's have a R E A L Union!

Elections
Results
Terry Stephenson was elec-
ted unopposed as the new
president of R S M . Stephen-
son first came to IC in 1966
with the misguided intention
of doing Mechanical Engin-
eering. After three years, he
saw the light and entered
Mining II last October.
He believes that R S M U
should be apolitical, he in-
tends to preserve the essen-
tial character of the R S M
but also to expand it by for-
ging stronger links with In-
stitute Francais, Maria
Assumpta, etc.
There was however, com-
petition for some of the
other posts. Mike Moore was
elected as Vice-president,
somewhat surprising as
George Widelski, the well
known successful Hon. Por-
nographer, stood in opposi-
tion.
The elections ended with
a revolting display by M .
Gowers, the new Hon. Por-
nographer who regurgitated
the beer he had just drunk
from his enamel potty!
Presidential Candidate BRIAN
HAINS speaks...
There are four main areas
with which a student union
should be concerned. These
are (a) to cater for the re-
creational needs of students,
(b) to improve the nature
and presentation of their
academic work, (c) to en-
courage students to become
aware of the society of which
they are a part, and (d) to
negotiate with the college ad-
ministration on behalf of the
student body.
The recreational strength
of the union resides mainly
in its clubs. The only direct
contact that many students
make with their union is
through the clubs. Every
effort should be made to
channel more money into
A C C , R C C and SCC, and to
encourage the clubs to rea-
lise their full potential. To
make the clubs more success-
ful it is essential to have
more women and non-scien-
tists around IC, at present
this can most easily be done
through the U S K . Opportu-
nities should be provided in
the first week of term to en-
courage U S K people to join
IC clubs.
The development of an at-
mosphere of understanding
and cooperation between
teacher and taught is essen-
tial for student involvement
in academic matters. With
active support and encour-
agement from the students,
using the staff-student com-
mittee as a base, I feel that
many improvements can be
readily made if the students
provide the initiative. It is
vitally important that the
power in the departments
should be spread more even-
ly throughout the teaching
staff, students can profitably
collaborate with the A U T in
this. The end result of all
these moves would be a much
better standard of teaching.
Participation
Students are now eligible
to vote. How conscious are
they of the issues on which
they will be required to pass
a judgement? The union
must do all it can to make
students aware of the work-
ings of the society that they
will soon be entering. Ways
in which this could be ach-
ieved would be through par-
ticipation in community
action projects, and through
the NUS. For example, NUS
are forever trying to show
how universities relate to the
whole educational system,
and to the needs they are
supposed to be satisfying.
There are many points of
current union policy over
which there is a deadlock be-
tween the students and the
administration. It must be
remembered, however, that
decisions made at union
meetings or on the Govern-
ing Body are seldom irrevo-
cable. There are some areas,
for example, where I feel that
if we ask for a little less than
what we have been demand-
ing, then we shall accrue
several immediate benefits.
In my stay at IC I have
been involved with Astro.
Soc, U S K , SCC Exec, Com-
munity Action, staff-student
committees, and, of course,
IC Academic Affairs Com-
mittee. I have observed on
the Governing Body, Fin-
ance and Executive Commit-
tee, and have been continu-
ally involved with the senior
members of the college ad-
ministration. Backed up with
this experience I believe
that I can present the stu-
dents case to the best advan-
tage of the students.
