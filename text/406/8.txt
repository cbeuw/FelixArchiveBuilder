Cinema
The Return of the Pink Panther ( U ,
United Artists). Directed by Blake
Edwards; starring Peter Sellers,
Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lorn and
Catherine Schell.
A L T H O U G H S O M E of the gags are
overplayed and generally flogged to
death the film i s as funny a s one could
w i s h . T h e team seem to have enjoyed
themselves tremendously during the
making of the film s o much as that Ms
Schell w a s unable to stop her self bursting
into laughter on a couple of o c c a s i o n s .
Sellers gives another excellent
performance a s the bumbling, inept
Clouseau who eventually drives h i s
superior, Dreyfus (Herbert Lorn), to
insanity. Lorn is outstanding as Dreyfus
and the s c e n e s involving he and Sellers
are some of the funniest I've seen for a g e s
C l o u s e a u now a patrolman and recently
suspended by Dreyfus is reinstated and
asked to recover the P i n k Panther
diamond that has been stolen from the
L u g a s h National Museum. H e immediately
makes for the South of F r a n c e to apprehend
L i t t o n , a l i a s T h e Panther (Christopher
Plummer). Litton proclaiming innocence
sets off for Lugash to catch the real
crook and hence clear himself.
The plot developes and after much
chasing to and fro a l l the protagonists
arrive in Gstaad where Litton catches-up
with the real thief (his wife); C l o u s e a u
catches up with Litton; a l l three are
caught up by C o l o n e l Sharhi (Peter Arne),
L u g a s h Secret Service who i s mistakenly
shot by Dreyfus in h i s attempt to k i l l
C l o u s e a u .
Dreyfus i s institutionalised, C l o u s e a u
gets h i s job and Litton and wife return
to their previous life of peace and
quiet. O n e cannot finish a review of
this film without mentioning Richard
W i l l i a m s ' P i n k Panther aminations which
are quite marvelously amusing to watch.
Theatre
Hamlet At The Old Vic
(National Theatre)
The usual reason for deciding to put
on a production of Hamlet i s , I suppose,
that there i s an actor whose time has
come. H i s stature a s an actor is such
that Hamlet i s the logical progression
of h i s career. However, Hamlet Is a
young man — it i s surely h i s youth and
inexperience that prevents C l a u d i u s from
k i l l i n g him earlier — s o that d e c i s i o n must
not be left too late.
Albert Finney is an actor whose time
for Hamlet h a s come, but it has a l s o
almost gone. H e i s too o l d a prince — he
injects the part with more experience of
life than it needs. H e i s a l s o too impulsive;
this i s the man who would leave the
scheming to others and go for C l a u d i u s
with both daggers drawn. H i s style of
soliloquy i s that of Jimmy Porter and
h i s s c e n e s with O p h e l i a bear similarity
to those with A l i s o n in ' L o o k B a c k in
Anger".
Peter H a l l ' s production itself i s
flat, literally. T h e stage is flat and
Lucky Lady ( A A , Fox-Rank). Directed
by Stanley Donen; starring Gene
Hackman, L i z a Minnelli and Burt
Reynolds.
IT IS A P I T Y that director, Stanley
Donen let sentimentality and the Hollywood
craze for 'happy endings' put what I can
only describe a s a lousy ending to an
otherwise entertaining film full of warmth
and character. The net result i s of course
to reduce what could have been a very
good film to an average seasonal-type
throw-up.
Hackman who plays Kibby, says that
it w a s the most spontaneous and natural
role h e ' s ever played - it certainly
looked it!
The trio, Kibby, C l a i r e ( L i z a Minelli)
and Walker (Burt Reynolds) team-up after
Harry ( C l a i r e ' s husband) dies and using
Walker's ketch ' L u c k y Lady' run bootleg
booze into the United States. T h e ketch
is s a i l e d by B i l l y (Robby Benson of
'Jeremy' fame) and together with the
three get-rich-quick adventurers soon
find that the bootlegging business is
not a l l fun and games, e s p e c i a l l y when
you do s i l l y things like buy-up M c T e a g u e ' s
(played by John Hillerman) consignment
of booze.
However, they escape M c T e a g u e ' s
wrath for the time being having sold the
booze profitably set about spending it on
themselves and doing-up the boat. They
continue their exploits until when the
are ambushed by McTeague and h i s
henchmen aboard the North Star.
The two heroes escape badly injured
and after a long convalescence join
forces with other 'independents' to try
and stop M c T e a g u e who has been knocking
off the small operators and stealing
their cargo.
In a spectacular finish McTeague is
blown-up and h i s cache of 50,000 c a s e s
of liquor divided up between the v i c t o r s .
Certainly a film with lots of gusto,
sad and funny moments. L i z a Minnelli is
good a s C l a i r e — she hams her way
through with a carefree abondonement
that i s well matched by Hackman's
portrayal of Kibby.

in a l l but a few scenes the actors are
on their feet presenting a monotony of
level and a lack of visual interest. It
was only when the stage w a s full of
characters that things really came to
life — in the play scene, when Fortinbras
requests permission to c r o s s Denmark
and arrives on stage with h i s army, and
the final duel scene. Perhaps it i s wrong
to c r i t i c i s e Mr H a l l for wishing to use
a s i n g l e acting area for everything from
the intimacy of the Queen's appartment
to the expanse of a plain with an army, for
it i s by frequent changes of set that
interest can be lost; here the scenes led
into one another with almost indecent
haste.
P o l o n i u s must be one of the director's
greatest headaches in an uncut version
of Hamlet. T h e part, a s written, gives
great scope for comedy but this a l l
appears out of place in the circumstances
of the whole play. Whereas the grave-
diggers (who, incidentally make no
pretence of the fact that they are refugees
from another National Theatre production
— ' T h e P l a y b o y of the Western World') are
extraneous characters outside the
mainstream of the plot, P o l o n i u s has a
much more important role to play a s
father to Laertes and O p h e l i a . Roland
C u l v e r plays him with a multitude of

out too far. H i s children (Simon Ward

A s pointed out by h i s eminence,
Uncle Frank Zappa has been makinn' mos
wunnerfull sounds of late, in the Form

"Nanook runs it"), and "one size fits all"

exception of "Hot r a / s " . A l l the ingredients

invention, superbly zany houmour, and
unbeatable musicians p l a y i n g the stuff.
Only F z ' s warp-factor eight brain nodules
could have conceived such blurbed
brilliance and put it out on v i n y l .
With this album, i t ' s back to the mind-

Out of the window goes the m u s i c i a n s h i p

constantly have to resort to — and Frank
goes along with it a l l , a great shame.

There i s an abundance of borrowed
ideas proliferating the album. It i s a
pity that they are rarely put to good
effect. A Latin-American influence
even creeps in on the fourth track of side
one, 'Mada Mada Samba' which in E n g l i s h
