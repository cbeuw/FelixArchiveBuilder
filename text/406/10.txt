CROSS C O U N T R Y
"The Handicap"
H A I L E D B Y S O M E a s the
climax of the terms racing —
the rest of us are less enthusi-
a s t i c - the Annual C l u b
Handicap takes place on the
last Wednesday before the
Christmas break. T h i s is
the race for which the a s yet
undiscovered have trained
hard and raced abysmally a l l
term. They might even have
laid off the beer a bit in the
previous week too! Such a
man is A Davey!
The u s e of the above
strategies is designed to
ensure that the Captain is
hoodwinked when he performs
that onerhous task " w o r k i n g
out the h a n d i c a p s " . F e l l o w
engineers would no doubt
comiserate with Ian ' c o s
this requires " s u m s " to be
done: on the other hand there's
plenty of s c o p e for " g u e s s w o r k "
in the " c a l c u l a t i o n s " , s o
it's not a l l bad.
T h e e s s e n s e of the " m e t h o d "
is one of estimating how
w e l l the v i c t i m should be
capable of running round
Petersham on the b a s i s of
i h e terms races and "current
f o r m " . Corrections are then
made in order to d i s c o u r a g e /
prevent previous winners or
first team members from
overhauling too many other
people. However, many hours
(or pints) are poured into
this ritual, t h o u g h , the
probability of the handicaps
b e i n g w r o n g r e m a i n s
infinitesimally c l o s e to o n e .
The race itself w a s not
uneventful. N i g e l would have
had a better handicap had he
not been first away and
•running round the unmarked
' c o u r s e for the first time (Ho,
ho — there's always next
year). R i c h would have made
a further contribution to keeping
the lad down by choosing the
wrong path t o w a r d s the
P l a n t a t i o n . Unfortunately Roman
and P a u l hadn't been forewarned
about this ploy a n d , g u l l i b l e
as h e l l , were a l s o led astray.
T h e result, what about the
result? W e l l , despite R o b
tearing the race apart from the
back—knocking a minute off
h i s personal best by hurtling
round in under twenty eight
minutes - Andy Davey hacked
over two minutes off h i s
expected time to finish a
comfortable winner. A prize
really ought to go to Mike
We I ford for predicting this
victory a week beforehand
in F E L I X .
Everybody e l s e finished
in a n order roughly like A l a n ,
M i k e , R o b , A l f , Roman, Dave,
P a u l , D a v e , R i c h , Ian and
N i g e l .
It should be noted that
Ian E l l i s ignored vociferous
requests to take part in the
race, m i s s i n g it for the third
year in s u c c e s s i o n .
"The Hog's Back 10"
E N T H U S E D B Y S t e v e ' s
recommendation " I t s a good
race, l a d s " , those, of us who
hadn't fled from London at
the end of term entered Guilford
and G o d . A C ' S H o g ' s B a c k
10 mile road race. Discretion
being the better part of V a l o u r
Steve had h i s warwound (or
knee) play up sufficiently to
allow him to watch the Inter-
nationals at C r y s t a l P a l a c e
instead... Having come third
in a 10 mile race the previous
weekend, R o b too decided to
give the H o g ' s B a c k a miss
and left for home at the last
minute.
Starting by the pictureseque
wooded lake at C u t s M i l l , the
course winds its way along
(and up) country lanes: through
the little v i l l a g e s of Seale
and Puttingham before turning
and climbing sharply to join
the A 3 1 at the top of the
H o g ' s B a c k after 61
A m i l e s .
From then on i t ' s downhill
all the w a y , taking the A 3
and finishing outside the
University of Surrey Sports
Centre.
Due to roadworks and
"impending police a d v i c e "
the organisers had moved
the start half a mile down the
road from the previous year.
Sadly they hadn't remembered
to mention the fact to the
first two coach drivers taking
everyone to the start, s o a l l
but those in the last coach
partook in an extra bit of warming
up... very popular. In keeping
with previous troubles at
locating starts, Paul w a s ,
of course, not on the last
c o a c h .
Once under w a y the race
became a pretty steady affair
after two miles and didn't
liven up much until the last
mile or s o — within striking
distance of home! On t h e other
hand everyone in the IC team
was a little suprised by
their performances. Paul
("I wanted to be sure I w a s
in under the hour") C l a r k e
finishing 52nd in 55.35, Dave
Rosen 66th in 56.50 and Ian
("My foot hurts") E l l i s 73rd
in 57.53 brought the first
team into 11th place. Dave
J o n e s finished 9 1 s t in 59.93
havingdiscouraged theopposition
during the race by " h o p i n g
to break 6 5 m i n s " . A l a n
L e a k e y finishing 142nd in
66.37 and Pete Johnson
pleased to " b r e a k 7 0 " by
finishing 147th in 6 8 . 1 5 made
up the second team w h i c h
gloriously d i d not come last!
Steve — we might even believe
y o u . . .

Four Flew Solo Pilots
During Vac.
Despite Hurricans and
other w a s t i e s the gliding club
has had a very s u c c e s s f u l
Christmas vac with four members
going s o l o . T h e s e were John
H a i g — Ferguson M i n e s II,
A l i s o n Jordon Chem 1, Andy
L i n c o l n E E 1 and Peter Sharp
M E 1 . A l l four of them joined
the club last term, A l i s o n
and John never having touched
the controls o f . a plane before.
John fortunatelV just managed
to go solo prior to the L a s h a m
Christmas dinner, otherwise
the a l c o h l i c content of the
brandy butter on the Christmas
pud would have rendered him
grounded. T h e other three a l l
went s o l o during a five* day
cause at the end of the C h r i s t m a s
vac. A l i s o n distinguished
herself by going solo at 8.45
on N e w Y e a r s day probably
making her the first new
solo pilot of 1976. She i s
a l s o the first girl student to
go solo with IC for approx
six years. L e t us hope that
there will be more.

IC Put On The
Map
On the Sunday following the
end of last term, three club
members took part in a South
— E a s t League Event at
Angley Woods in Kent. David
Rosen put Imperial C o l l e g e
'on the map' by winning the
8.4 kilometre A course in
74 minutes. R o b A l l i n s o n ,
IC champion in cross-country
tried h i s hand at the sport
for the first time. Running
the 6 kilometre B c o u r s e , he
soon caught o n , coming In a
very creditable 21st, and
doing the fastest time for
his a g e group. P e t e Johnson
took 97 minutes, only twelve
minutes slower than R o b ,
and w a s third in h i s age
group.
The club h a s a fairly full
programme this term with
nearby events suitable for
everyone taking place on
the next three Sundays. F o r
further d e t a i l s , s e e the club
noticeboard in the Union
Entrance H a l l or contact
D a v i d Rosen on Internal 4463.
Thanks must be expressed
to ex-student members Paul
Minton and John Y o u n g for
braving the weather to instruct.
