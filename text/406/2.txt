Scarborough Conference
F o r many"students, it is through either F E L I X or Sennet
or the national newspapers, each wit h their own b i a s ,
that they get. to hear of what went on at the Conference and
the p o l i c y d e c i s i o n s taken. T h i s in many c a s e s is the only
-communication between most students and the N a t i o n a l
U n i o n .
When this august body of situdents(?) decides that it
should forge l i n k s with the trade unions and take s i d e s
with the M P L A in A n g o l a , one wonders about the relevance
of s u c h time consuming motions and indeed the whole of
conference, to improving the lot of the I C student (and
that i s assuming that it needs to be improved).
Although p o l i t i c a l l y aware, many students through a
lack of p o l i t i c a l understanding tend to the opinion that the
conference is merely a forum for p o l i t i c a l theorists to
express their grandiose ideas for creating a perfect society —
they would not be far wrong.
T h e s o l i d l y theoretical approach to student affairs and
international p o l i t i c s i s , s u p p o s e d l y , what alienates people
from the N U S . T h e p r a c t i c a l a s p e c t s — the grants protests,
letters to the ministers concerned, the patronising c a l l s
for change — are a l l unimaginative but effective. However,
there is a need for strength of character within the National
Union heirarchy to direct resourceful efforts to the immediate
problems f a c i n g students. We are in danger of seeing decreasing
standards in education and must take p o s i t i v e and r e a l i s t i c
steps to protect ours and future students' educational
interests.
T h e e l e c t i o n by the union members of the N U S E x e c u t i v e
c o u l d ensure the relevance of the action taken by the
leadership and might help prevent the build-up of a clique
within the heirarchy of the U n i o n .
T h e N U S appears to be divorced from students — the
Union means little to them and the national conference only
serves to c r y s t a l l i z e their lack of interest.
Or is it simply a problem of communication?
If s o , the new national student newspaper, N a t i o n a l '
Student, could go a long way towards providing a solution.
T h i s is the fourth such venture by N U S and shows the
importance attacked to communications within the student
body by the N U S E x e c u t i v e . It is reassuring to know that
despite h a v i n g a Broad L e f t editorial l i n e , it i s not the
N U S ' s intention for the paper to carry propaganda.
We are sorry to announce that one of F E L I X ' S long-
serving staff has had to r e s i g n . Mike Williams, last y e a r ' s
Editor, contributed much to the paper; he lead it through the
difficulties of change from letterpress to printing on the
premises, and has continued to write a r t i c l e s and give
»advice s i n c e h i s term of office expired. Now M i k e finds
pressure building up in h i s post-grad course, and does not
feel it right to continue with F E L I X at the expense of h i s
studies. We w i s h him every s u c c e s s in the future, and thank
him for what he h a s done in the past.

made.for the husband or wife
of the student by some embassy s .
If that person is unable to
speak E n g l i s h or is unskilled
there is little chance of a
job and the family is put at
risk.
C h a r l e s C l a r k e , President
of N U S commented last
Wednesday:
"Mature students and their
families are suffering badly.
We have one example of a
mature student who had to
give up h i s course suffering
from malnutrition. The grants
system is heavily weighted
against those people who
missed out on further or
higher education at. 18. I
would s u g g e s t that the
government takes a leaf out
of the Department of E m p l o y -
ment's book and looks at the
way it treats people over the
age of 20 under the Training
Opportunities Scheme. The
contrast is c o m p e l l i n g . "
