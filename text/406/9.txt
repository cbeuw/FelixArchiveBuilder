Apathy or misdirected
slothfulness
H A V E Y O U ever noticed, how,
shortly after IC elections or
an N U S demo, various persons
start a c c u s i n g the IC populous
of d i s p l a y i n g extreme apathy?
Normally like all good students,
we nod and say ' T h e r e ' s a
terrible apathy problem here'
then dash off to some w i l d
exhausting activity such as
s k i i n g only to rush back and
use several armfuls of energy
consuming such beverages as
the Bar committee see fit to
offer u s .
The time has come to
protest!!... I emphatically
deny that the strong and
overwhelming display of non-
participation at elections and
NUS shindigs is not due to
apathy but a variety of other
l e s s condemning reasons such
as disinterest, lack of time,
e t c , etc.
Misdirected energy
In my Humble opinion if
anyone wants to protest about
the non-reaction to any issue
p o l i t i c a l , should instead
of s h o u t i n g " b l o o d y
t e c h n o l o g i s t s " and throwing
tantrums in the Union office —
they should examine the
curious amount of " m i s d i r e c t e d
e n e r g y " in this C o l l e g e . If
anyone doubts that vast
quantities of energy is not
used up for purely non-academic
pursuits then they ought to have
a look at any third y e a r ' s job
application form. Y o u w i l l be
amazed how many s o c i e t i e s and
sports clubs that the average
third year appears to belong to.
V a r i e d interests
I think it is about time a
new public image was given
to the average IC mob. We
should also show the world
that apart from working eight
hours a night, the average
IC student has wide and
varied interests.
F i r s t and most obvious there
is a very impressive c o l l e c t i o n
of road s i g n s and notices In
abundance around the Union —
these having been obtained
from a l l over Great Britain
by our enterprising representives
at these locations. T h i s
c o l l e c t i o n is frequently
overhauled and new ones
added. T h i s shows the extremely
by Karen Gadd
admirable determination and
energy of several intrepid
students here who go to
great lengths at . times to
purloin them.
Horrific influences
Secondly, there is the
unique and varied folklore
of the three sub-cultures
which simultaneously exist
in various parts of the C o l l e g e .
These three cults (known
to the few as C C U s ) have
an impressive mascot and
an interesting selection of
chants and ceremonies which
are open to t h o s e , initiated
and accepted into the appropiate
coven. The great white leaders
of these cults are renowned
and upheld as perpetuators
of the great IC tradition.
Unfortunately this great
tradition has been lost now
for several generations of
students. T h i s has caused
much frustration to the three
mighty warriors — as has
been recently displayed when
one succumbed to the unknown,
horrific influences of " a c a d e m i c
p r e s s u r e s " , and another
finding it all too much, ran
naked five times round the
Albert H a l l — this sad and
moving sight of B i g B c l a d In
nothing but a tophat w i l l not
be forgotten for many a long
year.
F r e n z i e d a c t i v i t y
The astonishing degree
of activity of those involved
in C G U s is a clear indication
that apathy does not prevail.
For who can c l a i m that
apathy has us in its sluggish
grasp w h e n . s o much frenzied
activity can be seen nightly
outside the Union after 11
o ' c l o c k at night. F o r while
the sight of several young
men simultaneously singing
and relieving themselves in
the middle of Beit Quad can
s t i l l be witnessed at regular
intervals we realise that the
s o c i a l and political life of
this Union is not on its knees.
And if you still have doubts
that energy and enthusiasm for
our great, common c a u s e are
not in evidence, try shouting
' K n i c k e r s ! ' in the Union
Bar. I did.

External Eclairs
A s you are reading this, I
shall be in Durham, a provincial
place somewhere in the w i l d s
north of Watford, at the N U S
U n i v e r s i t i e s Conference. I
shall probably be writing about
that next week. Meanwhile I
suppose you are all gasping
to hear the juicy details of
what happened at the Scarborough
Conference; y e s , I thought
you would be.
Imagine a hall filled mainly
with students; on the platform
are the National U n i o n ' s
Executive and their running
dogs; the E x e c u t i v e c o n s i s t s
of fourteen Broad L e f t i e s (a
coalition of the Communist
Party and various other
Marxists), two International
S o c i a l i s t s (the " T r o t s " ) and
one International Marxist.
The leader of this shower is
one Charles C l a r k e , a fat,
bearded old Etonian from
K i n g ' s C o l l e g e , Cambridge
(hiss) and a careerist.
You may have gathered
that these hacks are not
exactly my favourite people,
and can assure you that I am
not one of theirs. In fact,
no-one seemed to be quite
sure what I was p o l i t i c a l l y ;
Mary Attenborough concluded
that I was a " T r o t " and
Trevor P h i l l i p s that I was a
" B l o o d y T o r y " . I can now
reveal that I am a right-wing
Liberal ballshitter.
No doubt you have read
in F E L I X or elsewhere about
the main e v e n t s of the
Conference; the removal of Ms
Slipman as the chairman of
International P o l i c y Group, the
debate on Democrat i sat ion,
and the financial problems of
NUS T r a v e l .
You may not know about
some of the other debates
that took place, for example,
that on Government Economic
P o l i c y . T h i s showed two
things about the Broad Left
and the Trots; firstly they
know nothing about either
Government or E c o n o m i c s and
secondly, that they w i s h to
see the economy of this
country totally destroyed. The
motion which was eventually
passed c a l l e d for a massive
reflation of the economy, full
employment and an end to all
wage restraint. T h o s e Labour
Party students with whom
I later d i s c u s s e d this were so
disgusted with this motion that
they are considering with-
drawing their support from the
Broad Left in protest.
T h i s sort of thing is not
only outside the concern of
the N U S , but a l s o brings them
into disrepute which can only
weaken their influence with the
Government, small as it i s .
The democracy debate was
a complete railroad by the
Broad Left, mainly by Pete
Ashby and A l a s t a i r Stewart.
We were attempting to have
at least some of the E x e c u t i v e
elected by a ballot of a l l
students, and to improve
the procedures for electing
delegates to the c o n f e r e n c e s .
A s far as the latter is
concerned, I would like to
see the N U S lay down standard
election procedures which
would be a condition of
attendance, for example,
at least, to elect delegates
from a U G M , as we do at
IC, or (preferably) by a secret
campus-wide ballot, as is
done in many c o l l e g e s .
The conduct of Pete A s h b y ,
in the chair, was quite d i s -
gusting. H e twisted a motion
to take the third amendment in
parts so that he could be sure
of removing the s e c t i o n on
E x e c u t i v e s a l a r i e s , and then
he refused to accept a challenge
to the chair supported by the
required number of delegations.
The E x e c u t i v e also used a
member of the e l e c t i o n s
committee in support of their
c a s e , and A l a s t a i r Stewart,
supported by C h a r l e s C l a r k e ,
misrepresented the v i e w s of
the E l e c t o r a l Reform S o c i e t y .
The moderates did not a l l o w
this to go unrefuted.
The Tories and L i b e r a l s ,
together with the " S t u d e n t s
for Representative P o l i c i e s "
group, issued the text of the
letter from the E l e c t o r a l
Reform Society, despite
threats of legal action from
Charles C l a r k e . In their
attempts to foil the move for
direct e l e c t i o n s , the Broad
Left used every political
ploy, including underhand
ones, at their d i s p o s a l .
Perhaps after the next
national conference, at E a s t e r ,
the new E x e c u t i v e w i l l contain
a few moderates.
Services
At the last C o u n c i l meeting,
a very tired External A f f a i r s
officer presented some c o n s i t -
tutional changes to I C U C o u n c i l .
These included the creation
of the post of Services L i a i s o n
Officer, whose brief w i l l be
to arrange and advise students
on travel f a c i l i t i e s and
insurance s e r v i c e s , provided
by N U S or otherwise.
He might a l s o investigate
the potential of marketing
goods, for example, c a l c u l a t o r s ,
wine, A s c o t water heaters,
elephant-foot umbrella stands
or whatever by the U n i o n .
The new post should be open
for nominations after the
next U G M .
T h a t ' s a l l f o l k s , except
for my slogan of the week:
"Force the Reds to resign
and get students into a
mobilisation situation to
return an anti-imperialist
(but not anti-Imperial) Tory -
Trotskyite Executive pledged
to moderate policies".
