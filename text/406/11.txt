Could you afford
to be a
Married Student?
" M a t u r e Students with
f a m i l i e s , often running two
homes and commited to a
higher level of expenditure
than the average student, cannot
live on their present level
of grant without extreme
difficulty and without putting
their families at r i s k " .
T h i s was a statement
contained in a paper w h i c h
was recently submitted by
the N U S to the Department
of Education and S c i e n c e
(DES) to supplement its
1976 grants c l a i m . N U S h a s
revealed that mature students,
e s p e c i a l l y those with c h i l d r e n ,
are living below the poverty
line.
Students with f a m i l i e s face
difficu I ties because of anomalies
in the way that the grants'
regulations operate. A mature
student's allowance i s linked
with previous earnings. N U S
believe the a l l o w a n c e should

are unable to c l a i m payments
for large items such as
c h i l d r e n ' s shoes and winter
c o a t s and are unable to claim
family income supplement.
T h e N U S paper hopes to
a l l e v i a t e the hardship caused
to mature students as a result
of descrimination by D E S .
It g i v e s s p e c i a l mention to
those families where the
parents are unmarried and
therefore face even greater
problems. There are 600
mature students at IC.
Most problems occur when
both husband and wife are
students, as opposed to those
couples where one has a full
time job. The Student A i d
Fund w a s recently used to
supplement a price rise of £1
in the nursery fees and to keep
them at £10.50 per week per
c h i l d . T h i s is s t i l l a large
chunk out of anyones grant
and some students have found
it hard to afford this s e r v i c e .
Mature O v e r s e a s Students
