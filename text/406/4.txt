T H E QUESTION OF
DISAFFILIATION
Derrick Everett sets out below the pros and cons as he sees it.
Already G l a s g o w and Aston U n i v e r s i t i e s have left N U S ;
at present the question is being seriously d i s c u s s e d at St
Andrews, N e w c a s t l e , L i v e r p o o l , Brunei, Nottingham and a
few others. It is with this background in mind that I wish to
offer a brief summary of the arguments for and against I C ' s
continued affiliation to N U S .
F o r : N U S provides s e r v i c e , for example, N U S T r a v e l , for its
members.
A g a i n s t : Before Imperial C o l l e g e last joined N U S , it boasted
an excellent travel s e r v i c e of its own. Both E n d s l e i g h
Insurance and the B r i t i s h R a i l Card are available to non-
members.
F o r : N U S provides legal and financial advice to student
U n i o n s .
A g a i n s t : Why should we pay for these services s i n c e we
never use them; like much of N U S , they are irrelevant to a
large c o l l e g e with a w e l l - e s t a b l i s h e d U n i o n .
F o r : T h e N U S provides cultural and other f a c i l i t i e s for
students, for example, the Drama F e s t i v a l .
A g a i n s t : T h e political attitude of the N U S has destroyed
any power they have to stop a non-member Union from
entering the Drama F e s t i v a l (see Thomas Stevenson's
article in F E L I X No 403). However, they have stopped
G l a s g o w U n i v e r s i t y from entering the Observer " M a c e "
Debating Tournament (sic), which Is about to fold due to
lack of support. (It's surprising that the NUS E x e c u t i v e have
not entered, s i n c e they would manage to win every time).
A g a i n s t : N U S is e s s e n t i a l l y a fiddle on the part of a small
group of p o l i t i c o e s to obtain funds for their a c t i v i t i e s , for
their a c t i v i t i e s , for example trips to Rumania to sign 1 7 -
page communique's on " t h e State of the W o r l d " (text
available from T. P h i l l i p s , c / o U L U , Malet Street, London
WC1) and sending telegrams to support to the Marxist
Popular Movement for the Liberation of A n g o l a , (the USSR
are not really intervening with their troops, m i s s i l e launchers,
MiG21 fighters, etc â€” after all they do not really want the
oil!)
A g a i n s t : The political a c t i v i t i e s of this organisation have
have destroyed any credibility it might have had with, for
example, the Government over student grants, etc. The
voice of an independent Imperial C o l l e g e Union might
carry more weight!
For: If we leave, we shall weaken the voice of the moderates
within the National Union; we shall be taking the easy way
out. If there is any chance of changing the p o l i c i e s and
and politics of N U S , we should stay in.
Against: If we leave, we save IC Union a mere four thousand
pounds per annum.
The options we have are as follows:-
(i) To stay in and do our best to break the Marxist strangle-
hold on the N U S ;
(ii) To pull out for one year and encourage other moderates
Union to join us, just to see the effect on the N U S (and
possibly to get some c o n c e s s i o n s ? ) ;
(Hi) To pull out for an unspecified time and organise our
own travel arrangements, etc;
(iv) To do nothing until we are forced to pray three times a
day to Moscow and sing the " I n t e r n a t i o n a l e " and the " R e d
F l a g " in Beit Quad before morning lectures.
I await comments.
An idea for summer
Though there is s t i l l a long
time to go until summer, many
of you w i l l be beginning to
make plans for the long
vacation. One very enjoyable
way of p a s s i n g the summer
i s to work on a Kibbutz in
Israel.
The first Kibbutzim were
formed in the early part of
this century by S o c i a l i s t
J e w s who based their ideals
on a return to work on the
land, and are thus based on
agriculture. On the Kibbutz
there is no need for money as
everyone r e c e i v e s according
to his or her needs; this
includes everything required
to live, such as food, housing,
clothing, education, medicine
and recreation. E s s e n t i a l l y
the Kibbutz is one big family.
The life on a Kibbutz fifty
years ago was difficult, but
in spite of the hardships the
Kibbutz movement has flourished
until now about 100,000
p e o p l e live on the 250
Kibbutzim spread throughout
Israel.
For many years Kibbutzim
have been taking in volunteers,
J e w s and n o n - J e w s , from all
over the world for periods of
time of a minimum of one
month. T h i s alone makes a
Kibbutz working holiday
worthwhile as one has a
unique opportunity to meet
people from a l l w a l k s of
life and from all environments.
A typical day on the
Kibbutz would c o n s i s t of
getting up at s i x o ' c l o c k
(ugh!), working for s i x to
eight hours with breaks for
Mutters Arising
" G o o d Morning, C a m p e r s "
as I said on New Y e a r ' s
morning. No one appreciated
it then either, so I had better
get down to the three bits of
business which I would like
to r a i s e : -
National Societies
I now have a list of all
the overseas registered
students. It is available for
you to consult, at your leisure.
Writing - up Students
Writing-up students are
e l i g i b l e for full Union member-
ship. I now have a list of
a l l students, who are registered
as such, and Union cards are
obtainable from the office.
Rules for Publicity
The following regulations
were passed at the last
C o u n c i l meeting, and are
now in force:
breakfast and lunch. The
rest of the day is free for
swimming in the pool, going
on an excursion or just lazing
in the sun (which is guaranteed!)
So if anyone is interested
in working on a Kibbutz or
would like more information,
please contact Andrew P a l
through Mech Eng 2 letter
racks. After a l l , as the posters
around C o l l e g e say:
" T h e r e is more to life on
a Kibbutz than picking o r a n g e s "

John
