Take it back!
1. Know your rights
When you go shopping for a
record deck or a pair of shoes,
remember: if you buy something
and find it to be faulty then
you are entitled to your money
back from the shop where you
bought it. Y o u need only
accept a replacement or
repair if you prefer; neither
do you have to accept a credit
note. Do not be fobbed off
by the shop telling you to take
the article to the manufacturer.
By law, (The Supply of Goods
(Implied Terms) A c t 1973),
the retailer must rectify the
fault. Y o u cannot expect all
your money back if the article
has worked perfectly for a
reasonable period of time
and of course, the damage must
not be of your own making.
You may a l s o return the
goods if they are not as
d e s c r i b e d , either on the
wrapping or by the s a l e s
a s s i s t a n t . Furthermore, you
may require the goods for a
s p e c i f i c purpose. E v e n if this
purpose is not the usual one,
you are entitled to a complete
refund if the item is not
satisfactory provided you
s p e c i f i e d clearly your intended
use for the article. If you
incur expenses due to the
goods being faulty you may
c l a i m these from the shop.
Y o u cannot take up a complaint
about a gift. The person who
gave it to you must return it.
When buying something
on hire purchase you s t i l l
have the right to complain.
Y o u s h o u l d , in this c a s e ,
complain to the people with
whom you made the H P agree-
ment which may be the shop or
a finance company.
2. Guarantees
It is always a good idea to
send off the guarantee: it
may give you extra protection.
Y o u cannot lose your rights
under the 1973 A c t - whatever
you s i g n .
3. E x c e p t i o n s
There are various c a s e s
where you do not have any
right to redress:-
a) If the defect w a s brought
to your attention before you
made the purchase.
b) If you examined the goods
before purchasing and should
have been able to notice- the
fault during that examination.
c) If you bought the goods
at an auction.
d) If you are buying the godds
not as a private consumer but
in the course of b u s i n e s s .
e) F o r s e r v i c e s such as dry
c l e a n i n g , hair dressing or
package h o l i d a y s .
In a private s a l e , such as
buying a car from a private
motorist, it is up to you to
examine the goods for faults.
Y o u are entitled, as in any
s a l e , to ensure that the seller
has the right to s e l l the
a r t i c l e . Redress is only
p o s s i b l e if s a y , the car is not
as described to you as regards
age or mi leage.

Termly Review of Refectory
and Residence Charges
A s you w i l l have seen
from the last issue of F E L I X
the Rector recommended to
the Governing Body that
Refectory prices should be
kept at their present level
but that H a l l and House rents
should be i n c r e a s e d
substantially. The Governing
Body accepted the recom-
mendation and so while
refectory prices remain the
same rents are going up. I
consider the rent levels
that are coming into effect
as reasonable, and consistent
with the full student grant.
The increase in the middle of
the s e s s i o n is regretable
and hopeful I/ w i l l not be
necessary in the future.
A s w e l l as the increases in
rent there are - 'ncreased
economy measures in the
H a l l s particularly.
Increases in Tuition F e e s
The new levels of tuition
fees for the s e s s i o n 1976/7
were announced in December
by the Secretary for Education,
Mr Fred Mulley. F e e s for
home students are to be
increased from £140 to
£182 and those for Overseas
Students are to go up by
£96 from £320 to £416 per
annum. T h e s e ' increases
w i l l have no great effect
on the majority of students
whose fees are paid either
by their L o c a l Authority, or
by their government, if they
are from overseas. Those
who w i l l be affected, some
quite seriously are the home
students who are on a
minimum grant and have to
pay their own fees, and
privately sponsored overseas
students. I believe that a
hardship provision of some
description w i l l be made for
most continuing students
and I will let you know what
these provisions are as soon
as I c a n . Many overseas
students w i l l be forced to
leave the country as a result,
claims the U K C o u n c i l for
Overseas Students. They
also say " B y its action the
Government is making ability
to pay the main criterian for
accepting students from
o v e r s e a s . " I am sure that
you would agree that this
should not be s o . I hope to
write a longer article on
this topic soon.
Are you satisfied with the
Union
•John. Downs publicised in
F E L I X last term that a
Working Party has been set
up to find ways in which
the Union could be made
more responsive to the needs
of the membership. The
Working Party w i l l be
pleased to receive any
comments that you may wish
to make. Contact myself,
John Downs, R i c k Parker,
P h y s i c s P G or John Morgan,

moan about the Union now is
your chance.
NUS Conference - The
Student Road to Revolution
I was pleasantly suprised
at the light character of the
NUS Annual Conference
but most disappointed at a
great deal of the debate.
Far too much time was spent
on d i s c u s s i n g i s s u e s which
I do not feel are c r u c i a l to
the body of students in this
country. There w i l l not be
any world crashing changes
if the N U S d e c i d e s to support
the M P L A in A n g o l a or not.
Our national union, for we
are all members, is definitely
political at present and
almost a l l its p o l i c i e s are
extremely left wing orientated.'
I disagree with many of them,
as I am sure a large number of
the people reading this
article do. The p o l i c i e s and
composition of the E x e c u t i v e
of the N U S are very difficult
to change because of the
NUS structure. " S h o u l d we
remain members of N U S ? "
is a question which we should
Be thinking about deeply
and not h a s t i l y . More of this
topic later in the term.
Wishing you all an
enjoyable and s u c c e s s f u l term.
