A N E M E R G E N C Y MOTION instructing
the N U S E x e c u t i v e to write to the Home
Secretary c a l l i n g for a public inquiry
into the events at UMIST and to press for
prosecution of those arrested was carried
by a majority and an almost equal number
of abstentions.
The resolution denounced " t h e v i c i o u s
and calculated attack on the audience
at an N C C H meeting on Saturday 29th
November by the National F r o n t " .
The meeting, held to d i s c u s s " T h e
State, the L a w , and Ireland" had been
infiltrated by between twenty and thirty
N F members identifiable by black arm
bands. Six people were seriously injured
including a senior lady c i t i z e n who was
hit over the head with a chair.
£1200 of damage was caused to
UMIST Union buildings in the ensuing
rampage. Subsequently, police arrested
29 N F members suspected to have been
involved in the disruption o f the N C C L
meeting. T h i s happened despite threats
and hounding of executive officers of
UMIST Union by persons s a i d to belong
to the N F .
However, the police who are vigorously
pursuing the case have had difficulty in
pressing charges against any of those
detained. T h i s arises from the fact that
they were arrested about 500 yards off
the uii versify campus. The task of
proving that they were on the campus
has not been aided by the arrested
refusing to take part in identity parades
as is their prerogative.
A spokesman for UMIST Union says
that despite the great deal of work being
put in on the case by the police the
case is proceeding at a very slow pace.
An amendment to the motion c a l l i n g
on C O ' s to expel any of their members
known to belong to the National Front
was heavily defeated after an impassioned
plea from Charles C l a r k e warning that
its passage would a s s i s t those who
were attacking democracy.
The motion reiterates previous policy
and c a l l s for the banning of platforms
for extreme right-wing factions and urges
for an a c t i v e opposition to f a s c i s m .
Condemnation of South Africa's invasion
of A n g o l a was declared in an emergency
motion which recognised the M P L A
( P e o p l e ' s Movement for the Liberation of
Angola) as the only genuine liberation
movement in A n g o l a .
P a u l B u r t o n ( U C L ) m o v i n g the resolution
said it was vital that the N U S tonight
alongside the Anti-Apartheid Movement
(AAM) and the Angola Solidarity Committee
in support of the M P L A who were a
coalition of a l l the left in A n g o l a . They
were not controlled by R u s s i a as stated
in the bourgiose right-wing press.
Sue Slipman, N U S National Secretary,
summing-up on the debate which was
somewhat one-sided, reiterated that it
was imperative to support the M P L A
who were fighting for a P e o p l e ' s Republic
of A n g o l a . " P r o g r e s s i v e s all over the
world supported the M P L A as does the
N U S " , she said.
The motion was overwhelmingly
carried.
Clarke lashes out at
university unions
IN HIS O P E N I N G speech to the Scarborough
Conference, C h a r l e s C l a r k e , President
of N U S , stressed the need for students
to unite and work on a larger s c a l e
with the trade union movement.
It was, he said clear that no government
could survive without at least the tacit
support of the trade union movement.
Students could not now assume that
they would find themselves in the
upper reaches of the professional c l a s s .
The vast majority of students would
become trade union members. A s a
result, the natural a l l i e s of the student
body were no longer the chamber of
commerce, instead they were the trade
unions.
Speaking on the cuts in public expend-
iture, Mr C l a r k e made it clear that the
N U S was playing a leading role in the
fight against them and as such would
face attempts aimed at defeating the
U n i o n . " T a c t i c s of 'divide and rule'
w i l l be u s e d " , he s a i d . He took the
opportunity to c r i t i c i z e those university
unions which had been slow to take up
the fight against cuts in educational
expenditure.
"I must say to conference that the
leadership of s o m e , not a l l , large
university unions appears to be happier
to stand by and watch the fight... They
seem to look at the fight to save education
as though it had nothing to do with them;
with a lack of concern which w i l l ultimately
destroy the education sector that they
claim to represent".
He a l s o condemned attempts to
interfere in the internal democracy and
accountability of trade union structures,
including in their electoral p r o c e s s e s .
NUS could expect the same treatment,
as their opposition to government p o l i c i e s
grew nearer the centre.
" T h e twin principles which this
conference must uphold are the maximum
involvement of the N U S ' s members in our
union — for without this we are nothing —
and the principle of accountability.
By this I mean the accountability of
this union to this national conference and
not to the judgements of the Lords of
the Fleet Street p r e s s " .
Mr C l a r k e went on to warn of the
implications of d e c i s i o n s taken in other
countries around the world. It was no
coincidence that loans were yet again
being proposed after their s u c c e s s f u l
introduction, albeit partially, in West
Germany. Similarly, the attacks on 60%
of overseas students who come from
the poorest parts of the world was
intensifying just at the time the Govern-
ment was pursuing oil deals in the
Middle E a s t .
The problems facing students had to
be confronted honestly. It did no good
to condemn cutbacks in education
and at the s a m e time say that the
government's economic policy is broadly
correct — the cuts are central to this
policy. It was time to realise that the
era of 1968 was over.
He concluded: " T a c t i c s full of sound
and fury and no more, in the end, signify
nothing." " S e v e r e and difficult tasks
lie ahead. But the fruits of s u c c e s s are
worth fighting for. They are: better
education from the n u r s e r y to the
university; the rights of many more
people to education throughout their
lives; and an end to education for the
privileged few.
" T h e ashes of defeat would be
bitter indeed. For it is not only our
own education which is at risk but
the education, permanently destroyed,
of those who w i l l follow u s . "
Foreign students
getting a rough deal
O V E R S E A S S T U D E N T S were being used
as a whipping boy to implement more
cuts, Trevor P h i l i p s , N U S vice-president
responsible for overseas students,
claimed at a press conference on overseas
students. Mr P h i l l i p s was speaking
immediately after a motion condemning
discrimination against overseas students
had been carried by an overwhelmingly
majority. L e s s than ten students voted
against it.
In this context therefore, the overseas
students (OSi campaign was directly
linked to the grants/cuts campaign. Mr
P h i l l i p s said that this term was the
first time the OS campaign had been
taken-up demonstrably and in his view
the best way to pursue the campaign
was through the areas of the N U S .
The motion on OS which c a l l s for a
day of action says that the present
attacks on OS "constitute a deliberate
and systematic attempt to exclude from
post-schoo!
education, overseas students
who are not privately wealthy or backed
by Government or b u s t n
~ s s interests. The
consequence of frits is to restrict
educational opportunity to the ruling
elite in those c o u n t r i e s " .
Opposition to proposals contained
in the report of the C V C P Study Group
on Postgraduate Education and the
I L E A document c a !
i i n g for drastic
reductions in the number of overseas
students in I L E A c o l l e g e s , were expressed.
Such proposal? had to be " s e e n i n . the
context of the '^creasing use of rascist
arguments by various groups, which

Housing
Ballyhoo and nowt else
F O R T H E S E C O N D conference running
the problem of housing was d i s c u s s e d . \
Charles C l a r k e moving the section of j
the E x e c u t i v e report on housing described !
it as " t h e most politically d i v i s i v e i
issue facing students and young people !
in g e n e r a l " .
There was an expanding demand by j
young single people for single places j
to live. For National and local government j
to take-up this problem and provide i
accommodation for them, seemed to be
Mr C l a r k e ' s solution to the problem.'
The actual housing motion was
eventually carried by a majority after
all three amendments, each supported by
a different extreme political group, had
been debated and defeated. The policy
adopted reaffirmed previous policy. Note
of the acute housing shortage, increased
use of repressive legislation against
squatters occupying empty property, the
Criminal T r e s p a s s L a w and the massive
increase in hails of residence charges
were made. C a l l s foi a rent freeze and
usage of short-life accommodation were
seen as temporary measures against a
very poor situation.
In the meantime, the N U S E x e c u t i v e
has been charged with a careful study
of the situation and to seek solutions
with the help of the relevant interested
bodies.

attempt to lay the biame for the c r i s i s on

" M a n y overseas student;, have no
choice but to come to Britain due to a |
history of exploitation and repression
in their own countries which has resulted
in a criminal lack of f a c i l i t i e s . Britain
has a moral duty to provide education
for these students and a l s o to those
who come from countries with f a s c i s t
governments''.
The motion c a l l s on the N U S executive
to approach vice-chancellors to reconsider
proposals to increase f e e s . It a l s o
believes that the overseas aid budget
T H E D E B A T E on the N U S constitution
was characterised by confusion and
strong emotions. Despite their status as
an independent body who usually do
not take part in d i s c u s s i o n s at conference,
the E l e c t i o n s Committee were called on
to give their views on points in the
main motion and accompanying amendments,
prior to their being d i s c u s s e d .
The E l e c t i o n s Committee were of
the opinion thai they would not be able
to carry out the instructions as stated
in the main motion, because they were
not equipped to do s o . T h i s was due to
their independence and therefore they
could not draft parts of the constitution
as they were being asked to do.
The main motion was moved by
Leighton Adams (Newcastle Polytechnic).
He wanted to see N U S supporting the
small c o l l e g e s and become more represent-
ative. There were 750,000 full and
part-time students in the N U S he pointed
out. " Y o u represent 200,000 of these
students at the outside. We are concerned
about the attitude of the average student
towards the N U S . It is not even an
attitude; it is absolute non-concern with
everything to do with the u n i o n . "
" T h e N U S effectively divorces the
majority of students because of the
small number of people who come to
these conferences assuming they represent
the majority."
Mr Steve Moon, Birmingham University,
moving the first amendment, called
for direct elections of the top four
executive members and said he recognised
the problems inherent in establishing
a majority ballot. A recommendation in
the amendment asked for the election
and observers in C O s to be carried out
by a secret ballot of all their ordinary
members.
Mr F r a n c i s haydn attacking the
amendment described it as a T o r y / L i b e r a l
plot that would lead to a right-wing take-
over of N U S if passed. He was not in
favour of democracy for its own sake.
" S t o p farting about and support the
main m o t i o n " , he concluded.
Gavin Grant speaking for the amend-
ment, thought that the N U S was in
danger of becoming moribund. " T h e r e
is a chance that direct elections w i l l
revitalise N U S . "
The amendment was overwhelmingly
defeated.
A second amendment supported by
the NUS executive strove to maintain
the existing status quo. Howard Smith
(Architectural A s s o c i a t i o n ) , moving the
amendment, pleaded, " L e t us clearly
reject the idea that the proposers of the
main motion seek democracy. The
democracy of N U S has been demonstrably
proven by its effective campaigning for
s t u d e n t s . "
Charles Clarke concuring with him
said the debate concerned the life-blood
of the U n i o n . It was taking place at a
time when many organisations were
trying to weaken N U S . " K i c k out the
reactionary main l i n e " , he concluded.
The second amendment was carried,
on a card vote, by 344,473 votes to
115,720. A majority of 2 to 1.
A third amendment, containing a
recommendation that the four full-time
officers should receive a salary of
52/30 of the main rate grant, was
vigourously opposed by members of
the executive with the exception of the
Treasurer, Hugh L a n n i n g . The new
proposals would mean a drop in salaries
from £3,200 to about £1,400 wjth £100 for
each re-election.
By this time, the debate had been
in progress for nearly three hours and
at only about five minutes to midnight,
a procedural wrangle developed regarding
taking th'e amendment in parts. The
amendment was eventually voted on as a
whole and declared carried, although
from the press table, it looked as if it
had f a i l e d .
A revote was demanded but amidst
the confusion that reigned, no clear
decision was announced. In the event,
the main motion was put to the vote
and declared lost.
However, a card vote taken on the
third amendment the following morning
— proceedings having been cut short
by e l e c t r i c i a n s turning off the microphones
and leaving - produced 184,702 for and
204,426 against.
T h i s result meant that no policy had
been decided on the N U S constitution.
So the status quo is maintained for
the time being.
£985 grant claim approved
T H E C L A I M F O R a main rate of grant
of £985 for the 1976-77 academic year
was approved by the conference. A
claim for a grant of £1,200 was heavily
defeated after an amendment to the
Grants and Education Cuts motion, in
which the claim was a part.
The Grants motion itself reaffirmed
continued opposition to any further cuts
in the education budget, and again
called for the abolition of the means
test and the ending of discretionary
awards. Demands were also made
for full grants for all full-time students
should be increased and a larger pro-
portion of it spent in providing greater
educational opportunity to working-class
people in developing countries.
over 16 years of age and a restoration
of a l l the cuts made to date in p u b l i c
expenditure on education, housing and
social s e r v i c e s .
The motion also c a l l e d on the N U S
E x e c u t i v e to organise " a national
demonstration just before the Annual
Student Grant R e v i e w " .
B u i l d i n g l i n k s with the trade union
movement was seen to be of central
importance to the campaign on grants
and cuts.
P e t e G i l l a r d N U S executive member,
speaking during the debate s a i d "It i s
time to put forward our own i d e a s and
take action. T h i s i s the only way we
are going to build l i n k s with the trade
union movement."
The motion was carried through with
a large number of abstentions.
