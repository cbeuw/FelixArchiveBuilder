Ms Cowell's report
found disappointing
B A R P R I C E S would remain at
their present l e v e l it w a s
d e c i d e d at the Refectory
Committee meeting held last
Thursday. T h e y would however
be reviewed at their next
meeting by which time the B a r
Committee would have presented
its report regarding the f i n a n c i a l
p o s i t i o n of the bars.
A profit of £ 8,879 h a d
been made on s a l e s in the
bars to date. If bar profits of
between £12,000 and £15,000
could be made, then it w a s
p o s s i b l e that brewery charges
and the recent rise i n wages
could be a b s o r b e d .
T h i s would mean that no
price i n c r e a s e s would have to
be made, at least for this
term.
Ms Cowell's report
The meeting a l s o d i s c u s s e d
Ms C o w e l l ' s report, following
her v i s i t here l a s t term, on
the catering f a c i l i t i e s . In it
she commends the U n i o n ' s paper
submitted to her for i t s " b r e v i t y
and clarity o f e x p r e s s i o n " .
Although she sympathised
with some of the opinions
contained in the U n i o n ' s
submission s h e felt that the
problems were not e a s i l y
s o l v e d .
The chairman of the Refectory
Committee, D r L e v y , s a i d he
welcomed the report.
"There are a number of points
which require careful con-
sideration, some of which we
have already had thoughts
about. It is nice to have an
authoritative statement from
somebody who has a knowledge
of university catering".
The report itself is largely
concerned with the f i n a n c i a l
problem of the catering system
but recognised that within
this w a s a management problem
of not i n s i g n i f i c a n t proportions.
Ms C o w e l l suggests in h e r
report that a n offer of accom-
modation at the middle
management l e v e l , an area i n
which recruiting poses part-
icularly difficult problems,
might help the situation with
its strong incentive value*
T h i s suggestion is already
being vigorously pursued by
the C o l l e g e .
The report a l s o s a y s that
"As the fixed costs represent
an increasingly high proportion
of the total cost, a fixed
income becomes more
essential". Ways suggested of
achieving this include charging
resident students a contribution
towards the catering c o s t s , or
including in their boarding fee
a certain number of m e a l s . T h i s
was not unfair, the report
says that "it is usually the
resident students who use the
facilities at the weekend,
breakfast time and evening
meals when, for obvious
reasons, labour costs are
highest",
However, D r L e v y does not
agree totally with this because
as he points out, the C o l l e g e
can only accommodate 2 5 %
of the total number of students
in C o l l e g e residence . H i s
suggestion, which h a s been
put to the C o l l e g e , i s to
charge a kitchen fee applicable
to the w h o l e of the I C
community. T h i s fee would
cover the catering staffs
wages thus leading to lower
refectory charges.
Ms C o w e l l in her report
refers to the barrage of
c r i t i c i s m l e v e l l e d at the
catering staff. Their morale
was very l o w and they c o u l d
benefit from a few months'
breathing space without
c r i t i c i s m .
Dr L e v y a l s o expressed h i s
great concern over this. "It
has to be realised that they
(the catering staff) are doing
a difficult job to the best of
their ability", he said.
"Members of the College
should remember that all the
criticisms they might make,
sometimes in very forthright
terms, do not help the catering
staff to do a better job".
A s k e d to comment on the
report, R i z Shakir, I C U Deputy
President and a member of
the Refectory Committee, s a i d
" O n the whole it w a s rather
disappointing and told us
little that we d i d ' n o t already
know. B u t then perhaps it
would be too much to expect
from a few hours w o r k " .
NUS Travel
A s from this week the N U S
travel office i n the U n i o n
L o w e r lounge w i l l only be
open Mondays, Wednesdays,
and F r i d a y s . T h i s i s b e c a u s e
Valerie h a s to go and work i n
the branch at G o l d s m i t h s
College on T u e s d a y s and
Thursdays due to a staff
shortage.
NUS to launch
newspaper
T H E N U S launches an eight-
page tabloid newspaper c a l l e d
" N a t i o n a l Student" on the
16th February. National
Student of which 100,000
copies are being printed, w i l l
be distributed free to each of
the 750 student unions * in
membership of N U S .
T h i s w i l l be the fourth
time that N U S has attempted
to produce a national student
publication — the other three
were Student, N e w Student and
Magnus.
National Student which i s
to be published termly w i l l be
freely a c c e s s i b l e to a l l
students and w i l l cover
student activity on a national
b a s i s . T h e paper should
have a high news orientated
content and it i s hoped that
a large proportion of the material
w i l l come from the staffs of
newspapers. In the long
term, N U S hope to expand
the service i n the form of a
weekly newspaper w h i c h
would be purchased through
news agents.
At the recent Student P r e s s
Conference at E s s e x U n i v e r s i t y ,
reservations were expressed
by representatives of student
newspapers attending the
conference. T h e y feared that
the advertising revenue a
college paper could accrue
would d e c l i n e considerably
as a result. T h i s , it w a s
contended, might force the
closure of some of the papers.
However, the unification
such a national p u b l i c a t i o n
could bring w o u l d be tremendous
and none at the Conference
was opposed to the i d e a
in principle.
The first major role that
Nation Student w i l l play
i s that o f informing a l l i t s
readers of the national student
strike o n F r i d a y , 27th February
in support of the grants c l a i m .
Trade union members teaching
in c o l l e g e s are expected to
give support to the strike.
Students on strike are being
a s k e d to come to L o n d o n for
what, it i s hoped w i l l b e
the biggest student demon-
stration ever mounted.
T h e demonstrators w i l l
assemble at 2.00pm i n B e l v e d e r e
Road, near Waterloo station,
and w i l l march to Hyde P a r k
Corner. There they w i l l be
addressed by C h a r l e s C l a r k e ,
President of the N a t i o n a l
U n i o n of S t u d e n t s , a n d
prominent trade union leaders.
