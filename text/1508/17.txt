Deutsche Bank Analyst Program opportunities
We have opportunities for students in the Corporate
& Investment Bank: Global Transaction Banking (GTB).
Analysts in GTB beneﬁt from working with industry leaders,
exposure to live and complex deals and contribute to the
success of a division continuing to grow despite a difﬁcult
economic period.
GTB provides one of the Bank’s increasingly competitive
platforms that contributes signiﬁcantly to the Bank’s overall
proﬁtability and continued success. GTB proﬁts for 2011 are
up 14% on the same period for 2010. In a volatile year the
Bank’s CEO regards this as an ‘impressive result’.
Analysts working in GTB experience a career in investment
banking, working with clients who include governments,
institutions and international brand names. As an analyst
you will be out meeting these clients early in your career.
You will have all of these opportunities whilst maintaining
a great work/life balance.
We are currently taking applications for our Analyst
Internship Program and Analyst Training Program.
Applications close: Friday, 17 February 2012
