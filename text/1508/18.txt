COMMENT
During the past week the Felix website
has seen some of its highest activity
ever, as various members of College have
taken to our comment boards to voice
their opinions over last week’s report on
the potential closure of Clayponds. Dem-
onstrating that the postgraduate voice
at Imperial is very much alive and well, it
shows that adjustments to college life are
not solely exclusive to one section of Im-
perial’s community, but rather everyone.
Even considering this, undergraduates
may be wondering why they should care
about postgraduate accommodation, es-
pecially if they have no intention of pursu-
ing a postgraduate education. It is unwise
to continue through an academic career
at Imperial without awareness of the de-
cisions that college takes on important
issues such as Clayponds or the Holland
Club, and the effects that it has on other
hugely significant areas of college life.
There can easily be repercussions from
postgraduates to undergraduates across
the college, as, obviously, the student
body is not rigidly divided.
Needless to say, Felix will report on
these issues and bring them to the atten-
tion of Imperial, especially when bodies
such as the Union are incensed at what
they believe to be a lack of communica-
tion on the part of the college. It is impor-
tant to remember that Imperial is not only
made up of undergraduates, nor solely
postgraduates. Not every major story will
revolve around one particular area of col-
lege. The fact that there have been so
many comment from those affected by
the Clayponds story cements the fact
that news has a reach across the entirety
of Imperial.
Comments will continue to be made on
upcoming stories as term unfolds. Con-
sider your own input into the stories that
affect you and ensure that you are aware.
After all, as you are no doubt reminded,
it’s not all about academia here. Make
the most of your Imperial experience and
understand what is happening around
you.
Herein lies the point: exercise your right
to respond to articles online, and in do-
ing so keep the stories that matter to you
at the forefront of college life. Consider
writing a comment article for this very pa-
per about an issue that you find impor-
tant. Whether Imperial-related or not, free
opinion and expression is at the forefront
of this paper.

Keep a keen interest in
the latest college issues
A
fter finishing my under-
graduate degree, I’m
now in my fifth year at
Imperial studying for a
PhD. Recent news about
the future of Clayponds and the Holland
Club has led me to believe that Imperial
is disconnected from the lives and needs
of postgraduate students.
The college has confirmed that it in-
tends to close Clayponds, the postgrad-
uate student estate in South Ealing. Its
replacement is Griffon Studios, a new,
purpose-built development offering
“high quality and affordable accom-
modation options” in Clapham. Unlike
Clayponds, there is no pastoral care sys-
tem at Griffon Studios – a key benefit of
living in university accommodation that
is particularly attractive to students new
to London or the UK.
A 19 square metre studio there will set
you back £235 per week. £300 per week
will get you a 22 square metre studio
that’s apparently suitable for couples.
In contrast, a single room in Clayponds
ranges from £104-£148 per week and a
single studio is from £181.
To put that in context, I’m a post-
graduate student in the Plastic Elec-
tronics Doctoral Training Centre and
my stipend is £1299 per month. Living
in the smaller studio would cost me a
whopping £1018 per month and leave
me with £281 for living costs. No won-
der they haven’t filled all the rooms. My
girlfriend and I privately rent a flat in
Southfields twice the size of Griffon
Studios for £230 per week – a much bet-
ter deal than anything Imperial offers.
The Rector responded to criticism
from Clayponds subwarden Craig Court
by saying that a focus group found stu-
dents wanted to be within 30 minutes of
South Kensington. Who doesn’t? But
not at these obscene prices. Imperial
appears to have completely forgotten
to investigate what a typical PG can af-
ford. Furthermore, in a move that will
undoubtedly be a bitter blow to current
Clayponds residents, proceeds from its
sale will be used to subsidise accom-
modation in Griffon Studios to the tune
of £25 per week. What is the point in
building new accommodation that is so
expensive it has to be subsidised from
the proceeds of selling existing housing
that has great feedback from residents?
The second development to cause me
to doubt Imperial’s commitment to PGs
is the recent news that college catering
is planning to convert the Holland Club,
the staff and PG bar in the basement of
the Sherfield building, into yet another
catering outlet. The response has been
overwhelmingly in support of the Hol-
land Club. At the time of writing, the
Save the Holland Club Facebook page
has nearly 800 fans and there are 57
comments on a college announcements
blog post – all against the plans.
Jane Neary, head of Commercial
Services, told Felix that catering was
unable to meet demand last year. How
can Neary explain that I can go into any
catering outlet at 1pm and find cabi-
nets unfilled? I worked as a bookseller
for six years and when the shops didn’t
meet customer demand, we didn’t build
a new shop, we restocked the shelves or
changed the products. Perhaps catering
should try this approach before trying
to assimilate a well-loved and excel-
Imperial doesn’t seem to
care about its postgrads
Griffon Studios – the best a postgrad can get?
lent place to drink into another soulless,
drab Taste Imperial clone?
I can understand that Neary wants to
provide facilities for taught PGs, but
destroying the best place on campus for
PGs to relax with colleagues and friends
(and blag free beer off their supervisors)
is not the way to go about it. At best,
catering’s plans are misguided; at worst
(and more cynically) it is an attempt to
increase the size of their food and drink
monopoly and make even more money.
There is a common thread running
through both of these issues: Imperial
needs to become more aware of the fi-
nancial realities of postgraduate life and
needs to listen more carefully to the
needs of students and, in the case of the
Holland Club, staff. It is unacceptable
that the Union was not consulted about
Clayponds and that the bar manager,
Kevin Young, and the Holland Club
committee were not consulted about
catering’s plans from the very begin-
ning. Postgraduates are responsible for
the bulk of the world class research that
makes Imperial the great institution it
is. I urge the college management to not
let them down.
