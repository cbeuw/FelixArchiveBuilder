FILM
Clooney is an actor who seems to push
the boundaries as he ages. Although
known for playing slick and suave char-
acters, here he is in The Descendants, a
warm and modest family drama in which
the confirmed bachelor of Hollywood
plays a dedicated father of two, living in
Hawaii. The twist is that his wife ends
up in a coma after a water-skiing acci-
dent. He even admits that he’s been the
back-up parent in their marriage. But it
appears the responsibility is suddenly on
him now. Not that he minds, of course;
he just doesn’t have a clue on how to go
about this.
His elder daughter Alex(andra)
(Shailene Woodley), the rebellious
teen who drinks and experiments with
drugs, is far from pleased that her loser
of a dad is now her full-time guardian.
The younger daughter, Scottie (Amara
Miller) is a cheerful little firecracker, but
not so little that she does not understand
The real surprise, however, comes
in the form of the two young actresses
who, even with very little screen expe-
rience, absolutely nail their supporting
roles. Their chemistry with Clooney is
more than just convincing, as the three
of them settle so well into portraying a
dysfunctional family. The news of their
mother hits them both hard, and Wood-
ley never overplays the rebellious side
of her character, and it is impressive to
see a complex role written for a teenager
handled so well by the young actress.
She has bitter feelings towards every-
one given her situation, but is grown-
up enough to understand that during
the more serious moments in her life,
she needs to step up. Payne also uses
Miller’s Scottie well, placing someone
young in a position of having to deal
with her mother’s impending death.
Set in Hawaii, the audience is very
often treated to some remarkable sights
of the beautiful island, which is a bonus,
really, to the gentle, almost therapeutic
view of family life painted by the always
consistent Payne. If you don’t like his
patient style, The Descendants is not a
film that will change your views on this
unique director, but for those who have
been following his work, this is another
rare treat that you cannot afford to miss.
Clooney is a family man
what is happening with her mother. Be-
ing young and full of imaginations, she
does do and say some outrageous things,
something Matt (Clooney) doesn’t quite
know how to handle.
The plot thickens however, as Matt
discovers his wife’s infidelity. This
comes as a complete shock to him, even
more so when the news is broken to him
by Alex. He’s devastated for sure, but
how can you be angry towards a coma-
tose woman? The simple answer is, he
can’t, and like any man on earth, he tries
to track down “the other man,” but per-
haps not for the same reason most men
would.
Even in the midst of quite a serious
turn of events, Payne makes sure to
inject some off-beat humour to keep
a healthy tone and pace. It never turns
into a serious tragedy, nor does it veer
towards hysterical comedy. There is cer-
tainly no room for any slap-stick com-
edy. The film speaks from the heart, and
the laughs are an added bonus. Payne
has had successes in the past with films
such as Sideways and About Schmidt,
about ordinary men going through un-
usual events, and “The Descendants”
does not stray far from what he is used
to, but has original themes of its own.
It has a stronger focus on family for
Time to drive away from all those damn photographers – and the crazy women who would do anything to get a piece of Clooney

The Descendants sure, as well as that difficult concept of
life and death, with forgiveness and re-
demption attached.
Carrying the entire film on his shoul-
ders is the invaluable Clooney, who
makes the task look so easy. It may not
be a particularly dramatic or showy
role, but playing the complexities of
an ordinary husband and father faced
with unimaginable challenges, Clooney
is a force to be reckoned with. He has
the confidence and likable qualities to
create a charismatic and unique central
hero. His interaction with his daughters
is a heart-warming one, as he develops
stronger bonds with his girls.
Just because his wife is in a coma,
doesn’t mean the world stops. Life goes
on, and Matt has not only his daugh-
ters to worry about, but also his work.
He’s a lawyer, taking care of his large
family’s enormous estate fortune, and
an important legal decision needs to be
made – the family wants the land sold
before a certain deadline, so they can
be millions of dollars richer. But Matt’s
not quite sure, and the pressure from
his family starts to build up. Everyone
dresses in colourful shirts, shorts and
flip-flops; but this doesn’t mean they’re
light-hearted when it comes to doing
business.
