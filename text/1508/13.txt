The annual National Students Survey
has been launched with all final year
Undergraduate students receiving emails,
letters, flyers and, if they don’t complete
the survey by March, a telephone call.
Make your voice heard: do it now!
If you are one of the 48% of Earth
Science and Engineering students who
has completed it – thank you. However,
if you one of the 93% of remaining Civil
Engineers to make your voice heard: do it
now!
But before you rush off to
www.thestudentsurvey.com here’s a few
tips:
Try not to be neutral
The options on questions range from
Definitely Agree to Definitely Disagree
with the ‘middle-of-the-road’ option being
‘neither agree nor disagree.’ However
neutral responses provide no indication as
to whether things are improving or need
some attention. Help us help you by not
sitting on the fence.

Rate your entire degree
NSS is very different to SOLE. Use SOLE
to discuss the positives and negatives of
your year and NSS for the positives and
negatives of your whole degree.
Give detailed comments on the free-
text questions
There will be free-text questions where
you can write what you like. Please be
detailed. Last year’s comments were the
basis of our NSS response.
Our London counterparts appear to
have a better turnout
You still might be asking why it is
necessary for you to complete the NSS.
Firstly, each Department must reach 50%
for the results to be published. If results
don’t get published the effect is as good
as nobody answering the survey i.e.
0%. Last year we increased participation
to 65% from the 2009 figure of 58%.
However our London counterparts appear
to have a better turnout with Kings
College on 75% and LSE on 70% – I am
certain we can do better than them!
Secondly, you have a chance to provide
feedback on ALL areas of your University
experience, including the Students Union!
This is far more than SOLE provides.
Last year’s NSS has already delivered
improvements for students
And finally you get a big opportunity to
influence the college.
The response written by the Union on
last year’s NSS has already delivered
improvements for students and shall
continue to do so next year. The results
have also shown how valued our library
is; providing the Union with support when
we lobbied for temperature-reducing
solutions as well as providing the
hardworking library staff with a sense of
satisfaction.
So please, spare 5 minutes and ‘Have
Your Say’.
Scott.
