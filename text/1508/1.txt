Chinese ambassador visits Imperial
The Chinese Ambassador to the UK
visited Imperial College last week to
discover more about Imperial and also
gave a lecture on the role of innovation
as the path to success in twenty first cen-
tury China. Xiaoming Liu has been the
Ambassador for China since 2009 and
took the time to talk to Chinese staff and
students to find out more about their ex-
periences at the college.
Mr Liu was given a tour of the Im-

THE FELIX SEX SURVEY RETURNS
SOLVING THE GENDER GAP
Sophia David
Investigating Imperial’s efforts to support women in the workplace
There are currently 81 female profes-
sors at Imperial which make up just
15% of the total holding this senior
post. Felix has investigated what Impe-
rial is doing to combat gender inequali-
ties and support the career progression
of women. In fact, a substantial move-
ment exists within the College and
members of staff have told Felix of the
“ground-breaking steps” that are being
taken to support female staff. However,
they have also highlighted that this is
“working better in some areas than oth-
ers”.
The main female-support system is
the Academic Opportunities Commit-
tee (AOC), established in 1998, which
aims to ensure “a level playing field
for women academics at Imperial Col-
lege.” More recently, since 2008, Aca-
demic Ambassadors for Women have
been appointed to represent women
across the College in the Engineering,
Natural Sciences and Medicine facul-
ties.
Patricia Hunt, a senior lecturer in
the Department of Chemistry and part
of the Faculty of Natural Sciences’
(FONS) Academic Women’s Commit-
tee at Imperial, told Felix how, “We are
Aemun Reza perial incubator and was introduced to
researchers who have worked in col-
laboration with China. Some of these
researchers included Professor Sir Brian
Hoskins, Director of the Grantham In-
stitute, who is a Foreign Member of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Pro-
fessor Yike Guo from the Department
of Computing who established a joint
laboratory of scientific informatics be-
tween Imperial and Tsinghua University
in 2007.
The Ambassador and his wife, Mme
HU Pingua, have been visiting other
universities around England. When
speaking about Imperial, the Ambas-
sador stated: “Imperial College London
is the last of the G5 elite universities in
Britain I have visited, however people
in Britain often say ‘last but not least’
and my visit to Imperial today is rightly
described in this way. Your university
matches any of the other four – Oxford,
Cambridge, LSE and UCL and your
reputation, strengths and innovations
are much admired worldwide.”
Rector Keith O’Nions meeting
with Mr Liu last week
promoting the support of women at all
stages of their career through mentor-
ing, advice and support.” She described
how the AOC assists with and reports
issues ranging from the development
of breast-feeding facilities to working
hours for those with young families, as
well as encouraging women to apply
for higher positions.
On the reasons for the gender imbal-
ance, Hunt commented, “You need to
remember that someone in their 50s
now (and a professor) will have start-
ed studying science in the university
system when sexism was prevalent,
when the women were winnowed out
and so there are few women to pro-
mote. In Chemistry, we have a modest
“pipeline” of early career women com-
ing through. I hope with all the work
we have been doing over the last few
years that there will be a much larger
percentage of women in the department
and thus a much larger percentage of
professors in the next 5-10 years.”
Karen Makuch, the Women’s Ambas-
sador for the Natural Sciences Faculty
and Chair of the FONS AOC, told Fe-
lix that the steps taken by the College
were “ground-breaking” in terms of the
advancement and retainment of women
in academia. She highlighted the Elsie
Widdowson Fellowship for academic
staff returning from a period of mater-
nity leave. The purpose of this award is
to allow female academics to concen-
trate fully on their research and allows
the Department to relieve the member
of staff of any teaching or admin du-
ties. FONS has also initiated a scheme
so that women post docs returning from
maternity leave will also be relieved of
their teaching for 12 months, to mir-
ror the action taken for permanent
