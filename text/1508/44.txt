“White wins with a similar kind of
idea to the puzzle two weeks ago
with the move 1. a4! (the idea of
course being to play Rb5#). With
a few careful checks it is easy to
see that black has no reasonable
attempts to prevent white’s attack,
the sequence which forces white
to play on for the most amount of
moves is: 1. a4! Rb1 2. Rxb1 Rb6
3. Rxa6+ Rxa6 4. Rb5#”

SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to
make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots. The
numbers in each square indicate
how many edges of the square
are part of the loop, so if it con-
tains a “2”, you know that two
and only two out of four edges
have lines. That’s all the info you
need to get the one logical answer
(though waiting a week to see the
solution will also do). Answers to
puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk,
as the puzzles team recieves one
wee haggis per correct solution.

Word Wheel
Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using the
central one. NO plurals, conjugated
verbs, comparatives or superlatives,
because I said so.. There is always at
least one 9 letter word.
TARGET: 20
