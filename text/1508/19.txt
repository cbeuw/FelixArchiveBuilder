FELIX 19
H
eston Blumenthal can
be a bit pretentious.
Take his recipe for
green bean salad:
1. Build a zero-gravity space capsule
and ﬁll with water. Bring water to boil.
2. Chop ends off beans using Navy
SEALS LASER tracking system.
3. Insert vacuum-packed green beans
into the capsule.
4. Cook for 265.3π seconds, monitor-
ing the crunchiness of the beans every
0.0000000001 seconds using the Vick-
ers hardness test, set to HV10.
5. Refresh beans with liquid nitrogen
cooled Amazonian rain water and dry
in CERN Particle Accelerator.
6. Serve with injection moulded mus-
tard vinaigrette.
It’s enough to make me scream “No-
body cares! Nobody cares!” It‘s just
overenthusiastic drivel from what ap-
pears to be a slightly unhinged, bor-
derline OCD chef. It’s all too much
when chucking the beans into a pan for
3 minutes and then drizzling with ol-
ive oil would have done just ﬁne. My
brother, knowing my disdain for over-
complicated cooking, gave me Hes-
ton’s At Home book for Christmas – a
bitter-sweet respite from the hilarious
annual gag of planting a chocolate wil-
ly in the bottom of a used, otherwise
empty PlayStation 3 box. Although the

Higgs boson? Probably Heston again
last laugh was on me when, during my
college canteen-inspired squelchy veg-
etable soufﬂé demonstration on Box-
ing day, the liquid nitrogen container
spilt over his leg and he lost four toes.
There is, however, one seemingly
unnecessarily arduous recipe in the
book that is worth the bother. That
makes my initial anger look rightfully
misjudged, that I should just “calm
down dear”. I used to think a potato
was just a potato, that to make chips
all you had to do was boil them for 10
minutes or so and then fry them. Hes-
ton has taught me otherwise. First, the
potato chips need to be rinsed under
running water to remove any surface
starch. They are then boiled in a pan
of simmering water for 20-30 minutes
and left too cool. They then go in the
freezer for at least an hour, before be-
ing fried in grapeseed oil to create a
light crust. By this stage, used to meals
prepared in under half an hour, my
stomach starts grumbling. Then it’s
back in the freezer for a further hour as
my stomach starts to invoke the Battle
of the Somme, before being fried again
at a higher temperature until they are
golden. So, that’s around 3 hours to
make some bloody chips. It all seems
a bit like when the US spent millions
of dollars developing a special pen that
could work in space, and the Russians
just took a pencil.
When I ﬁrst made these triple-
A
pparently 2012 is going
to be a bumper year for
protests, and I am quite
looking forward to them.
As the late Christopher
Hitchens once wrote, “seek out argu-
ment and disputation for their own sake;
the grave will provide plenty of time for
silence”. But what would the brilliant
man have made of the recent tuition
fees increase? Having earned a third
class degree in PPE from Oxford, and
having achieved in his short life much
more of merit than David Cameron –
who got a first class degree in precisely
the same course – he would probably
advise against going to university at all.
He’d say that it’s vastly overrated, except
for the cheap alcohol.
In saying this, Hitchens would be – as
he often was – wrong but for all the right
reasons. When he graduated, he became
social science editor on the Times High-
er Education Supplement, something
unthinkable today, even with a first-
class degree. Currently, a good degree
is essential for all but the most menial
of jobs, and even then, work experience
and networking are always necessary
for starting in better-paid careers.
The life of a graduate in 2012 is wild-
ly different from that of one from the
Hitchens era, which makes the tripling
of tuition fees appear to be, at first sight,
“the biggest betrayal of young people
in postwar British politics” as anti-fees
campaigner Michael Chessum wrote in
the Guardian last year. If going to uni-
versity is so essential, why would the
Government want to discourage thou-
sands of people with higher fees?
But is it really as bad as Chessum
claims? A graduate on a standard
£25,000 salary will only pay back £7
per week. Think of David Cameron as
a friendly gentleman giving you four
years of education and housing in ex-
change for two pints every Friday even-
ing, and it really doesn’t seem like such
bad value. In a world where no degree
often means no career, you must really
misunderstand the loan repayment sys-
tem to be put off going to University
because of the fees.
No one should be discouraged from
applying simply because they are poor:
the Government will give you enough
money to live and pay for your tuition,
and by the time you have to pay it back
you’ll be quite rich by many people’s
standards. Of course, in an ideal world
there would be no fees, and of course
it’s annoying suddenly having to pay
more of them, but that’s all it is: an-
noying. Like a persistent itch, or David
Cameron’s patronising and rather sinis-
ter voice: we just have to deal with it, it’s
really not that bad.
Consequently, protesting about tui-
tion fees is a waste of good placards,
especially when there is a huge number
of other, vastly more worrying, issues
about which to protest. The semi-pri-
vatisation of the NHS, the disgustingly
harsh sentences for some London riot-
ers, corporate lobbying of the Govern-
ment, the complete neglect of environ-
mental issues, the abolition of the EMA,
the technocratification of the EU, the
approaching war with Iran, the secre-
tive drone war in Pakistan, widening so-
cial inequality, the atrociously selective
reporting by the popular press, rising
unemployment, and the soaring price of
cooked chips, I dived straight in for a
golden ﬁnger starving as I was after 3
hours of waiting. But WOW! What a
corker! This, I immediately decided,
is how chips are supposed to be. This
is what the potato is for. This is what
happens when a nerdy chef cooks
and re-cooks different potato recipes
hundreds of times and uses science to
guide him. Odd how you can forget
what really good food tastes like. And
each time you rediscover it, you won-
whisky, amongst other things.
There is so much to be angry about in
2012 that protesting about tuition fees
is like running into a burning house to
rescue an expensive packet of biscuits
while several young children scream
with pain as the flames engulf them in
the next room.
Nevertheless, this weekend the Na-
tional Campaign Against Fees and Cuts
(NCAFC) will meet for its National
Conference in Liverpool. There they
will discuss and decide how this year’s
student protests will unfold. My only
hope for the conference is that they
leave as the National Campaign Against
Cuts, putting the question of tuition fees
aside until the more serious matters are
resolved.
Far from being a heroic student upris-
ing of the Mai ‘68 variety, as Chessum
likes to say, tuition fees protests merely
distract us from the truly important
issues. As students, rising youth un-
employment is our greatest worry and
we should concentrate our anger there.
That and the soaring price of whisky,
naturally.
This, I immediately
decided, is
how chips are
supposed to be.
This is what the
potato is for
“
This, I i
This, I
decide
decide
der how you ever put up with anything
else. Why you should live to eat. The
chips crunched gracefully, they didn’t
splodge. The middle was as soft as mo-
hair. These are chips as I have never
known; they surprise you. One imme-
diately feels privileged that this fellow
has shared his secrets with us. It’s like
Fernando Alonso giving you a driving
lesson, or Stephen Fry showing you
how to use Twitter. It’s just… well, it’s
just lovely.
NO, LEFT THE CHIPS IN THE OVEN FOR 10ns TOO LONG. WHY ALWAYS ME?
