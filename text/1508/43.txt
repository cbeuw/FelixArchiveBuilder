Hïroscopes*
Scörpio
Today, you begin your gap year with
an excursion across Finland to see the
Northern Lights. The landscape gets
you pondering the insignificance of
man and the awesome power of nature.
You’re interrupted by a Facebook tag.
Turns out you could have seen them
from Scotland anyway. AntiLad.
Ariës
You’re in a lecture. Not only have the
lights been dimmed, but you’re pretty
sure your lecturer studied rhetoric Alan
Reichman. Except without the whole
Batman thing. You still want to give
him a blowjob. He accepts and, to your
dismay, extends his cock but not your
coursework deadline.
Taurüs
Today, you wonder whether your Nin-
tendo DS can turn invisible. You’d put it
down in the kitchen and it disappeared.
Oh wait, that’s just because all your
kitchen appliances are white too. Serves
as a friendly reminder from Nintendo to
all females. The world’s your kitchen!
Now sudo make me a sandwich.
Germiny
Today, you wash your hands after a long
day of danger-wanking – what’s this?
Finally your collector’s edition of Cool
as Ice arrived in the post. You literally
go nuts. When you can no longer take
the friction burns, you decide you’ve
done enough to melt Naomi Campbell’s
‘‘heart of stone’’. Oh baby.
Cäncer
This week you decide to try the double
decadence from Domino’s against all
the advice thrown at you. You almost
explode from the layers of cheese that
defy all logic. Forgetting to go to the
gym after, you become hench. The edi-
tor sees this, says ‘I told you so– (no se-
riously, what are you on about? – Ed).
Leö
This week, they’ve started locking
the Queen’s Gate again. Do they not
understand how hard right angles
are after a night out?! You attempt to
decompose the bars by constant unholy
acid reflux. What were you drinking at
the Union. No success. You turn into a
schnitzel and fuck off back home the
long way. Pass the ketchup.
Wirgø
Today, you realise your mother looks
like Angela Merkel. You wish you were
an orphan. We can fix that for you, just
check our classifieds for that assassin
ad. He’s really cheap and effective, but
remember, kids, Felix takes no respon-
sibility for the content advertised in that
section. Or in Hangman. In fact, we
take no responsibility. Ever. Now DO 1.
L!bra
What time does the Narwhal bacon?
Midnight? Chico time? When our sex
survey went live? No matter - it’s al-
ways hammertime in your pants. Now
get yourself over to reddit’s front page
and douche the night away. Might wan-
na turn off the Taylor Swift in case the
missus hears.
Sägittärius
This week, you stumble upon a kitten.
Deciding to take it to a shelter (you
über philanthroLAD), you run into that
one good looking girl from your course
(yes, one.) The kitten scratches her. Did
you know feline aids is a thing? Without
hesitation, you ask her out. It’s you or
nobody now.
Capriporn
Your little sister comes crying home
explaining that she lost her kitten. After
breaking off most of your friendships due
to one liners revolving around pussy, you
decide against finding the thing - it looked
pretty sick and distraught anyway, and
nobody likes an unhealthy pussy. You go
to the Holland Club instead. Oh wait.
Aquariunt
You finally get out of bed the morning
after yet another evening of free drinks
(why do all those nice guys splash out
so much? Aren’t they students too?)
Wait, what? A fourth year medic you
met on the way to college gave you
crabs. Not again...
Pisses
You’re in the Felix office on a Thursday
night. What are you still doing here?
Are you attracted to the barrage of Bün-
tarrrr? Do you hate your degree or is it
because of the girls we have down here
in the office? Nope, turns out it’s half
six and your page isn’t done. Fuck it.
*He’s obviously the best character from Heroes. Time travelling Asian. He’d stop Hitler.

DRUNKEN
MATE OF
THE WEEK
Sure, of course you came dressed as Tommy from the Rugrats. More like you love the feel of those nappies, son
Down with the Führer
Houston, we have an entscheidungsproblem.
O
ne of our Science Editors
was on the lash and end-
ed up in an underground
bar in Soho after a
birthday party. He came
across this Führerwein. Like a true lad,
he demanded it and got his credit card
out. Money is no object when it comes
to smashing the Führer. He downed it
and chundered within seconds of saying
“I SAVED THE FÜHRER”. Then came
the sudden realisation of his destiny; his
quest to track down and deal with the
other six horcruxes.
(Seriously, noble cause and that, but
are you feeling alright this week? – Ed)
You can obviously
do better.
