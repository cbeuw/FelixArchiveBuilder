Captains’ Interviews:
Hockey Club Captain
The captains’ interviews are still go-
ing strong! This week, Hockey club
captain Jason Ye meets up with me in
568 to discuss all things relevant to a
wooden stick and a small hard ball.
Introductions out of the way, I ask Ja-
son how long he’s been playing hockey
– he looks pretty sharp in his blazer and
hockey tie, and is obviously no new-
comer to the sport. “I’ve been playing
for ten or eleven years now, picked it
up at school when I was eleven and
haven’t stopped since!”
Such dedication to the sport has led
him to take up the mantle of club cap-
tain in his final year. He’s happy to tell
me more about the workings of the
club, and the team structure. “There are
about 90 people in the club. We have
four men’s teams and two women’s
teams, as well as a mixed team. They
play in both BUCS and ULU leagues,
and currently the men’s 1s are in the
Southeast 1A division, just below the
premiership, while the ladies 1s are in
Southeast 2A.”
I ask him what the aims for theeis
season are. Any hopes of promotion?
“Actually, the ladies 1s have had it
tough for the past few years, constantly
finishing second of their league! They
have a new coach this year who is re-
ally experienced, especially on the
player development side. It came down
to a single match last year, but this year
they’re top of their league so far, so
let’s see what happens.”
Jason tells me the Mens 1s were pro-
moted last year, but are having a tough
time in the league above. “Results are
picking up, though”. he says, “hope-
fully they’ll be able to make a stand”
(and presumably avoid re-relegation).
The club captain himself plays with
the seconds, although he says that the
teams are not fixed: “We try to have the
best people for each game. It depends
on how people are doing in training,
how they’ve been playing in the past
few matches.”
Speaking of training, I ask him how
it is set up. Any famous coaches, like
rubgy? “We go up to Harlington every
Monday, and operate a pitch rotation
policy. The 1s and 2s train together,
and come out half an hour before the
others. We try and make it so that ev-
eryone has equal amounts of time to
practice. As far as coaches go, we have
one for the ladies, one for the mens 1s
and 2s, and last term an ex-club captain
came along to coach the 3s and 4s. We
actually got the Engand goalkeeping
coach to come down for two specialist
sessions, though, which was amazing.”
Our 1st XI have nothing to envy the
first XV, then.
At this point I have to confess that
I knew little about hockey beforehand,
and while it may seem a bit presump-
tuous, I don’t think that many readers
know an awful lot about it either. Jason
gladly fills me in, though, when I ask
him about hockey in England. “pretty
much every town has a club; I’d say
there are more than a thousand in
England alone. It’s not actually a pro-
fessional sport, but players in the top
premier league teams do get paid – I
think you can earn about £40K a year,
which isn’t bad!” Curious, I ask about
the top uni teams: “Well, obviously
there’s Loughborough, [Reigning mul-
tiple BUCS champions who also play
in the English Hockey Premier League
– Ed.], and you also have Birmingham,
Brunel, Exeter, Cardiff...we’re trying
to break into that circle, and maybe
over the next five to ten years, get pro-
moted into the premiership.”
Competition aside, hockey seems
to be one of the more socially active
clubs, and I get Jason to fill me in on the
goings-on off the pitch: “I think one of
the great things about the hockey club
is the fact that we are a mixed club –
there are lots of social aspects that, say,
rugby or football miss out on by actu-
ally having two separate clubs. We all
know each other, and even if we don’t
play in the same teams, we might have
a post-match drink, or a get-together.
There’s a really good club spirit.
“We also organise a number of so-
cials, including – but not limited to – a
fresher’s meal (complete with mums,
dads, and incest), a fresher’s tour, a
Christmas dinner and an annual black
tie dinner.”
That much is clear, then – no short-
age of opportunities to enjoy yourself
in the hockey club! Jason adds that
around thirty people go on tour every
summer for with previous destinations
including India, Malaysia and Eastern
Europe. This year it’s Portugal – not
a country one would immediately as-
sociate with hockey, but Jason assures
me that there are clubs everywhere:
“there are quite a few teams in Lisbon,
and also in the south of Portugal.You
have to find the teams”, he says, but
they will be there!” Finally, with Var-
sity approaching (yes, it’s already that
time of year) I ask the captain about
the club’s approach to the whole thing:
“We take it very seriously. Last year,
the mens 1s won in an extremely tight
match; so did the ladies 1s. The mens
2s lost, unfortunately, so we’re hop-
ing to take our revenge. Traditionally,
IC are stronger at hockey though – the
mens 1s have never lost Varsity” Is he
looking forward to it? “It’s a whole day
with five matches at Harlington, start-
ing at 9...and the atmosphere is great!
Drinking port on the sidelines or steal-
ing the medics’ chicken head are part
and parcel of the experience too.”
I wish him luck for the next game, and
for Varsity –will they remain unbeaten?
