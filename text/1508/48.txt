IC Dodgeball grab silver in Essex Open
Ellen Kemp reports
On Saturday the 21st of January Impe-
rial 1s achieved a comfortable victory
against St Barts 1st for the ULU league.
It has been a troubled season for the 1s
so far, with some of the key players
injured. Although, second term kicked
off promisingly, with a knock-out win
over Goldsmith’s for the ULU cup, fol-
lowed by the victory over St Barts.
The 1s got strongly into the game,
showing from the beginning that they
will be bossing the game. The whole
team looked in good shape, moving
the ball confidently around the pitch
and playing some attractive attacking
football.
The duo of Hill and Wilson won the
control in midfield, giving Imperial a
clear advantage for the win. The first
goal came after a perfectly played long
ball by Fryatt, finding Zarnas on the
back of St. Barts’ defence, who then
calmly looped the ball over the keeper
to hit the back of the net for the 1-0.
Barts did not look willing to quit the
game and tried to get an equaliser at the
beginning of the second half. Although,
the back four (Nielsen, Woodhead, Fry-
att and McMonagle) looked pretty solid
and the goalkeeper Garner made two
decent saves from opponents’ headers
to keep Imperial on top. Then mid-way
into second half, Cherif passed to Zar-
nas who dribbled beautifully past three
of Barts defenders and after a double

hat started out as
any other Sun-
day afternoon
in January for a
group of Impe-
rial College students quickly turned
into a gripping, nail-biting occasion
and a first in Imperial College Wol-
verines dodge ball history, following
a string of outstanding performances
at the ‘Essex Open Dodgeball Tour-
nament’.
Wolverines I kicked off the tour-
nament by securing a confident 3-2
victory against the ‘Reepham Raid-
ers’, their fellow division one team
and therefore a challenging and wor-
thy opponent. They then went on to
defeat ‘Winchester Reloaded’ with a
phenomenal 5-0 outcome. They com-
pleted their qualifying matches with
yet another 5-0 victory against the
‘Warwick Freshers’, in spite of a slight
numerical mishap with the score-
boards, which didn’t go unnoticed by
the team and spectators.
This led them to be top of their
group and it quickly dawned upon
them that they would be pitted against
both of Warwick’s notoriously skilled
teams in the semi-final group, who
themselves joked that the Wolverines
would ‘have fun in the 5th and 6th
place play-offs’.
This, however, did not deter them
and following a spectacular 4-1 vic-
tory against the Warwick II’s in the
semi-finals the team’s confidence went
from strength to strength.
This on its own was not enough to
secure a place for them in the final –
they would need to beat the current
National Champions and Premier
League title contenders, Warwick I’s,
to achieve this. It was always going
to be a mighty difficult feat given that
the Warwick I’s have won gold in ev-
ery open tournament they’ve entered
since the East Midlands Open, one and
a half seasons ago! The match started
off with a win to Warwick in Game 1,
however this did not stop the Wolver-
ines, who managed to pull back a win
making the score one all. Warwick
then hit back fiercely, winning yet
another game and bringing the score
to 2-1 in Warwick’s favour. The Wol-
verines fought back, with remarkable
skill and notable performances from
both Alan Soltani and Scott Esnouf,
and went on to win another 2 con-
secutive games making the final score
an incredible 3-2 to Imperial, secur-
ing their place in the final against the
‘Bedford Bulls’, yet another Premier
League team.
The final proved to be just as thrill-
ing as the previous matches but with
a 4-2 outcome to the ‘Bedford Bulls’
and the Imperial Wolverines I’s were
delighted to come runner-up to the
undefeated team, taking home their
first ever silver medals – a particularly
proud moment for Adam Cutmore,
Club Chair, who has previously played
