I
t always just starts off so innocently.
“Hey mate, erm, can I just quickly check
my emails (i.e. Facebook, Twitter and
Google+ LOOOOOL obviously not
Google plus) on your laptop?”
The correct reply to such a request is usually:
“Fuck no, suck my balls. Why don’t you just
check that shit on your phone like every other
normal human being on the planet?”
That’s not what you end up saying. Obvi-
ously, you end up just groaning and sighing
and saying “Yeah, sure mate, here you go”. All
the while, you’re frantically trying to surrepti-
tiously delete the shit outta your internet his-
tory and secretly hoping you remembered to use
“private browsing” for your private time. Uhoh,
remember last night. Shitting hell that definitely
wasn’t deleted was it? Why would the one time
you decided to see what “gay dwarf porn” looks
like (overrated – probably, this is all fictional)
be the one time you forget to purge your brows-
ing data after? Even if you haven’t been looking
at anything too out there, there is still no way to
look like a classy man-about-town in your cir-
cle of friends after they’ve had a look through
your history. Especially when they look at your
Facebook history and see that you scrolled
through every single picture of about 10 differ-
ent girls and go to their walls with stalkerish
frequency.
Of course that’s not the only thing to worry
about. There’s also the absolutely classic reali-
sation that you keep your Facebook and Twitter
signed in at all times; you’re so incredibly so-
ciable that you couldn’t bear to go without talk-
ing to people in non real situations for too long.
Oh great, now they’re going to do a “hilariously
brilliant” Facebook rape in which they update
your status saying: “I love it up the arse xx”.
Fine, this isn’t too bad, it’s worse if they see the
filthy inner goings on of your mind in vid-
eo form. This is mainly because the only
embarrassing thing about that Facebook
rape is its lack of originality. I mean, if
you’re going to try to make me look gay
(as apparently we are all now 8 and that’s
a bad thing) at least be more discrete than
me “liking big strong men”. How many
gay men do you know have come out on
Facebook with a poorly worded, gram-
matically dubious status update?
Just hope your mate isn’t sadistic, if he
is then your ex is getting a long winded,
heart felt, proclamation of your love via
both Facebook and Twitter (damn them
being so easily connected). Again, who
decides to tell someone they love them in
such a way. That’s what a drunken text at
2am is for, for fucks sake.
The perils of lending your
laptop to others...
You want to use my laptop? Well you can’t, just wait until you’re around a
computer; nobody wants to talk to you that much

ATTEMPT OF
THE WEEK
Can Hangman go global again? No.
YOU DIDN’T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT BROWSING BBC WHEN YOU BORROWED IT
The only solution to this problem is to stand
over their shoulder and watch them like a
hawk. “Here, I’ll just get you to your emails.
There we go, okay, cool, you done, good”.
Then again, if you’re feeling in the mood for
some Derren Brown Jedi mind tricks, you can
go super blasé about it all. “Yeah sure mate,
here you go”. Then just walk away and don’t
even look at them. Hum a little tune to embel-
lish the performance. They’ll think: “Wow, he
must be bulletproof and have nothing incrimi-
nating on here. There are probably zero self-
taken pictures of him posing with his shirt off
and his ‘abs’ clenched frantically”.
So there you go. Don’t lend someone your
laptop if you can help it. If you can’t help it,
either watch them like they’re your newborn,
or overconfidently, nonchalantly hand them it
as if it’s no thing. Good luck.
