T
hree out of four second-
ary school students are
not taught physics by a
specialist physics teacher.
16% of those eligible for
school meals make it to university.
Independent schools, however, man-
age to send 96% of theirs to higher
education. These points are raised by
Teach First (whose mission is to ad-
dress educational disadvantage and
who have been active around Imperial
recently). Their solution? Train as a
teacher yourself. If enough individu-
als who are physics graduates become
teachers, the problem will be solved.
Now, it’s been said society has three
essential facets. One, to provide food
and shelter so individuals can survive.
Two, to bear and rear children to re-
place the dead. And three, to educate,
research and to achieve progress so
that the next generation is better and
smarter than everything that came
before it. The first two of these tasks
have been done by animals for bil-
lions of years, but the third is done
only by humans in the last 400 years
or so since rediscovery of ancient
Greek civilization. It led to the inven-
tion of the telescope, microscope and
air pump, and gave rise to the idea of
Pigs – our friends and maybe our equals
Learn to think better of teaching
mass education. Virtually all our soci-
ety’s progress comes from these last
four centuries. In light of this, it could
be convincingly argued that the job of
a teacher, who educates children, is
one of the most important and worth-
while jobs possible.
Yet when I look closer at what the
reality of being a teacher entails, I see
a pay freeze for the next four years at a
time when inflation has reached 5%. I
see their pensions under attack. Micro-
management, bureaucracy and over-
work erode their work-life balance. At
least office temps don’t have to take
their work home with them. Teach-
ers also suffer a lack of respect from
the ill-informed, who think they finish
work at 3pm and do nothing in school
holidays. Furthermore, I see the school
building project cancelled, religious
groups invited to take over the run-
ning of schools (Education Secretary
Michael Gove was forced to deny they
would teach creationism) and market
forces being introduced to education
(don’t get why this is bad? Imagine if
access to education was as unevenly
distributed as income).
There is a reason for all this, the
mainstream press will be quick to tell
us: the debt. In 2008, several large fi-
G
etting home one day, I
was met with an unwel-
come, albeit familiar,
sight. The living room
looked like a bomb had
gone off and the rubble had been picked
over by looters. In the kitchen, scores of
mice were defending the ceramic moun-
tain range by the sink from an amor-
phous and strangely sentient fungus. I
dared not step into the bathroom – from
what I could see, I didn’t know whether
to call a professional cleaner or an exor-
cist. Faced with this special circle of hell,
there was only conclusion I could reach:
I’m living with pigs!
On reflection, this might not be quite
the hyperbolic statement that it appears
to be. We may be most closely related
with chimps, but we share much in com-
mon with our barnyard friends.
Medically, we have much to owe the
pig. Before E. coli and human DNA got
drunk together at a party in 1977, most
insulin came from pigs – for which
diabetics of the world rejoice. And un-
less the law making motorcycle helmets
compulsory is repealed or stem cells ac-
tually prove themselves useful for some-
thing, we can fund the deficit in organ
donors with a little help from our por-
cine pals. Pig hearts, sow livers, bacon
kidneys – these things need not sound as
daft as they do.
Although, in the interests of balance,
maybe we should start making human
suede and human bacon? That brings me
onto another point of similarity. Human
meat tastes most like pork… so I have
been told. In the language of the Mar-
quesas Islands of Polynesia, the word for
human translates as Long Pig. However,
the semantics ties itself in knots when
the word for pig translates as Short Hu-
man. The words for all other animals are
a specified number of chickens in a coat.
The word for chicken is some kind of
vegetable, I believe.
Religion has tended to have a dim
view of pigs. They’ve always been
seen as dirty, greedy, unclean animals,
not quite kosher, quite haraam. I don’t
want to get into any theological debates
here (goodness knows Comment loves
them!) but it seems to me that pigs are
the scapegoat (scape-pig?) for the nature
of an animal that doesn’t walk with clo-
ven feet, but does speak with a cloven
tongue and thinks with a cloven mind.
Pigs have borne this misrepresentation
with characteristic good humour.
Pigs have given us so much, from
food to medicine, with so many charm-
ing phrases along the way. In return, we
have not been so generous. Apart from
the occasional lovelorn chap who mar-
ries a pig, we have consistently taken
without giving back. Given our intimate
relationship with our porcine cousins,
this is categorically wrong. So, what
can we do to redress this imbalance?
Offer them some rashers of Danish ba-
con made with real Danes? Or at least
a selection of chickens in an overcoat.
Maybe we should donate our kidneys en
masse as a gesture of reparation? Maybe
not. I can’t speak for you, but I’m using
mine at the moment.
nancial institutions were on the verge
of bankruptcy and managed to con-
vince the New Labour government to
transfer their private debts onto the
public balance sheet, with no strings
attached. The banks got an excellent
deal; teachers got sold out. This debt
had to be paid off, so all political par-
ties started talking about how much
they’d cut, by how much they’d reduce
public sector salaries and pensions,
and how much teachers would be eco-
nomically punished for the mistakes

The goals of Teach First are noble
indeed, but I can’t help thinking edu-
cation might be better if they joined
an anti-austerity group. Teach First
tells us to each solve the problem indi-
vidually, but they forget we have much
more power collectively when we
work together. History and experience
demonstrates this. With better working
conditions and benefits, good teachers
will naturally become attracted to the
profession.
One option that would be for the ben-
efit of everyone would be to give pigs
flying lessons. Microlights, biplanes,
Boeing 747s; it doesn’t matter. We could
transform the phrase, “when pigs fly”
from a cynical scoff at a far-fetched idea
to simply a measure of time. If pigs could
fulfill their dreams, what would stop you
from yours? On a practical note, they
could also fill in when BA strikes again.
I’m not the only one to notice this fun-
damental bond between man and pig.
Winston Churchill said: “Dogs look up
to man. Cats look down to man. Pigs
look us straight in the eye and see an
equal.”

Not even the ultra masculine Timothy Dalton can bring himself to shoot
man’s equals: pigs. He’s so dreamy...
