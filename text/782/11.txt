Imagine accessing books in the library
without even leaving your seat, let
alone walking across to the Lyon
Playfair... reading the latest college
news and information kept up-to-date
as you watch... playing an interactive
game with people you've never met
from all over the country... Not a
vision of University life in the
future—all this available here at IC
and now.
Anyone who has ever used the
central College Cyber or Vax
computers w i l l have passed
(unwittingly or otherwise) through the
College computer network I C P A D .
As well as linking all departments to
the the central machines, I C P A D
supports a number of more obscure
services and has links all over the
country. This article describes three
such services, one on-campus and two
off, which are available free of charge
from most computer terminals in
College.
L O N . L I B
The perfect antidote to a long book
list, the London Libraries system
allows you to check for availability
of books and other material in
libraries here at IC. A book can be
identified exactly by quoting an ISBN
or L C C A R D number, or it can be
found by browsing through given an
author or title.
The computer will tell you roughly
in which party of the library the book
is to be found, what type the book is
(reference, short term loan, long term
loan etc.) and whether the book is in
the library at the moment you
enquire.
In case the particular book you
want is not in the library, the system
also checks in all the other
participating university libraries in
London. Most useful of these is U L L ,
the University of London Library at
Senate House, Malet Street. A l l
students have an automatic right of
access to this library—just bring along
your yellow IC library card. Using
L O N . L I B you can confirm that the
book you want is available in the
library before jumping on the tube to
fetch it.
To connect to the system type C
then L O N . L I B and press R E T U R N .
The terminal will bleep, at which

driven requiring single character
responses such as A for Author
search. Example 1 shows a short
session where L O N . L I B is used to
enquire about a book called
E L E C T R O D E K I N E T I C S . Both the
copies at IC are out, but there is a
copy at U L L which is available.
The system is not totally foolproof.
Although all the books at U L L are on
the computer, not everything at IC has
yet been registered. In the unlikely
case that the book you are looking for
has not been properly registered, at
best the computer will say 'No Copies
Available'... at worst it may even say
a book is in the library without
checking simply because it does not
know any better.
L O N . L I B is a powerful system
allowing anyone direct access to the
libraries' records. However it does
not give much of an idea of the
content of the book there is no real
alternative to going to the shelf and
leafing through the book... yet.
I C R A D
I C R A D is the News and Information
service run by IC Radio in Southside.
It already contains an impressive
amount of information even though it
has only been running just over a
week. The theory behind its launch
was that all the information currently
read out on air on IC Radio should
also be made available from any
computer terminal in college.
The main menu is split into four
main sections—News, M u s i c ,
Information and Diary. The College
news section is kept up-to-date to the
minute, but the stories are necessarily
shorter and contain less detail than
those found in F E L I X . The Music
area will allow anyone to browse
through IC Radio's extensive record
catalogue, although that part is not
working yet.
The Information section shows
promise of building up into an large
college database with sections
maintained by college staff and
student societies. Topics as diverse as
the Humanities Lunchtime
Programme and Department of
Computing Society News are all to be
found here. IC Radio are particularly
keen to encourage more information
providers to come forward.
Finally the Diary section advertises
events in the College and further
