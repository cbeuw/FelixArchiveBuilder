Rout prevented
IC l s t - 3
Sussex University 1st—0
IC lsts—1
Ashford—3
IC lsts began a long Saturday with
a 3-0 win in a rearranged U A U game
against Sussex at Harlington. Coming
forward from the start, IC were soon
in the lead. Although 3 goals were
eventually scored, only fine
goalkeeping and inept attacking
prevented a rout. Paul Skip worth,
adding two to this season's tally of
five, seemed the only player who
knew what to do when presented with
an open goal.
After the afternoon's entertainment,
watching the 2nd team beaten 6-2 by
O M T 2nds, the lsts were chauffeur
driven to the astroturf at Feltham
School. The game started explosively
on the faster surface, with Middlesex
league opposition Ashford soon
working an opening goal. Shaken, IC
adjusted their game to the pitch and
were quickly holding their own.
Now, playing the best hockey of the
year so far, IC put pressure on the
opposition but barely penetrated their
penalty ' D ' . Failing to make any
impression attacking on the right,
partly due to excellent covering work
by Richard, Ashford pressed on the
left side of the IC defence during the
second half. Despite stout work, the
unsupported Brooking was regularly
overrun, leaving only Stonham and
Garside to defend the IC goal. Having
found the way through, Ashford
struck twice in rapid succession,
leaving the omniscoring Skipworth's
goal from a short corner as a mere
consolation. Ashford won 3-1.
Thanks go to 2nd team skipper Andy
Lewis for his sideline inspiration.
ORIENTEERING
Army training
Last Sunday, the Orienteering Club
went to an event in Stroud near
Rochester; the weather, for a change,
was excellent.
The event was very well organised
by the Royal Engineers and most of
the terrain was mapped out on their
training grounds. Consequendy, there
were many controls sited on features
such as World War Two bunkers and
several warning signs saying 'danger
high voltage fence' and 'beware,
booby traps'. However, this did not
deter any members from completing
the course but a few were cautious
wondering in which fields the mines
had been placed!
The green course (described by the
army as 'heavy going') had a
particularly gruesome control placed
in the middle of an inpenetrable
forest. Orienteers had to literally fight
their way through.
Training is as usual on Thursday
5.30pm in the Union Gym with post
mortems of previous week's events
and arrangements for the following
week being made.
SAILING
Foot Trophy
Last weekend saw the IC sailing team
in their first match, in the Foot
Trophy, organised by ex-University
of London sailors at Welsh Harp
Reservoir. In this first match of the
season the team showed great promise
with new helms Bill Chard and Rob
Kimberly showing consistent sailing.
The highlight of the weekend was
a very satisfying win for IC against
the University of London first team.
At the start, agression by Apostolous
Leonhidopolous forced the U L
captain away, allowing IC to take a
commanding lead with first and
second places. Unfortunately at the
first mark a mistake by Rob Kimberly
allowed U L to regain second place
and they capitalised on it to take third
place as well. However, IC were still
in the running and pulled back slowly
so that at the finish they had regained
second and third places to finish first,
second and third.
Team: Robert Kimberly, Carol
Eastwick, Bill Chard, Richard
Jarman (Capt), Sam Page, Daniel
Lucas-Clements, Apostolous
Leonhidopolous, Richard Morris.

R U G B Y
Convincing win
for IC
IC 1st X V - 2 4
Sussex 1st X V — 1 3
IC started their U A V campaign with
a convincing win. After an initial
setback, S Smith motivated the large
and mobile pack which began to
dominate up front leading to good
possession from which S Hall crossed
for the first of his two tries. The
forwards then tightened up the next
play and Pete Galley touched down
from a five yard scrum. After half-
time IC stepped up the pressure and
enterprising play in the three quarters
set up tries for J Sharp and S Hall on
the wings. From a penalty move ten
yards out E MacLean picked up a
scrappy ball and a drive over from
five yards to finish the scoring. This
was a very encouraging and
promising result for IC with man of
the match J F Blamo at fullback.
Impressive start
to UAU
IC 2nd X V - 2 1
Sussex 2nd X V - 0
A n impressive start to the U A U
competition saw IC 2nd X V stroll
home against an inferior Sussex 2nd
X V . Captain D Davies motivated his
aggressive pack into a murderous
frenzy shortly before kick off which
lead to total domination by the IC
forwards in the set pieces and loose
play. Tries flowed from D Davies (2)
and, K Dolan and Jonathon Menitt,
with outstanding support play from D
Clapp, J R Peacock and A Dixon. The
backs ran strongly and swift hands in
the centres allowed a lot of space for
the attacking fullback and wings.
Man of the Match: K Dolan
IC 3rd vs Sussex 3rd X V
Sussex failed to raise a team which
gives IC a default win.
