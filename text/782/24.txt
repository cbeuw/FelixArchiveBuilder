Government
proposals
lambasted
B A D L Y E D U C A T E D science
students and poor research could be
a thing of the future if Government
plans for university research
organisation go ahead. This is the
view of the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principles
considering the proposals of the
Advisory Board for the Research
Council.
The proposals involve the creation
of the three-tier system, with
undergraduate and postgraduate
courses, and a broad range of
research in the top tier. Second-class
universities would provide some
general teaching and limited research,
while only undergraduate and some
M S c courses would be offered by
third-class universities.
The Committee, while accepting
that a concentration of resources was
necessary to maintain the international
standing of British research, felt that
scientists would be deprived of the
freedom the present system provides.
It was also considered that some
students would lose the benefits of
education in a research environment.
Clubs sponsorship go ahead
IC Union clubs who gain extra money from sponsorship by outside bodies
will be able to keep all of that money for themselves, it was decided at
Union Finance Commitee (UFC) last night. The commitee passed a motion
proposed by Robert Gee, the Chair of the Athletics Clubs Committee
(ACC) and Neil McCluskey, the Chair of the Recreational Clubs
Committee (RCC), which says that "sponsorship money should not affect
the status of a club's recurrent grants from I.C. Union."
Toilet
smells
F O L L O W I N G the destruction caused
to the gents toilets in the Union
Building at the M E N C A P party,
plumbers were called in to repair the
damage. Recently obnoxious smells
have been emanating from the area
once more and the plumbers will have
to be called in again to make further
repairs. Alan Rose, IC Deputy
President, is unhappy that the job was
unsatisfactorily completed. The gents
toilets on the ground floor are to be
refurbished and partitioned into ladies
and gents in the near future.
BT
freebie
S T U D E N T S H A V E been enjoying
free international phone calls courtesy
of British Telecom for the last two
weeks. It was discovered that the pay
telephone in the Union Building was
giving free calls and soon long queues
were forming to take advantage of the
freebie.
Elsewhere in College, the coffee
machine in the J C R has been giving
out free coffee to lucky and thirsty
students.
Both faults have now been
discovered by the relevant authorities
and a new telephone has been
installed on the central staircase of the
Union Building.
Bomber
atlC
T H E I R A B O M B expert, Gilbert
McNamee, jailed for 25 years on !
Wednesday, was registered as a
student at IC. McNamee, who was
found guilty of conspiring to cause
explosions, including the Chelsea
Barracks, Hyde Park and Harrods
bombings, enrolled in 1979 for a
degree in Electrical Engineering.
A College spokesman said that as
far as he knew he had arrived on the
Monday for the start of term, but left
on Thursday to take up a place at
Queen's University, Belfast. College
first learnt of the connection when
contacted by the Times, and were able
to confirm that McNamee from
Newry Grammar School had been on
College lists.
Glazed
over
A F T E R N U M E R O U S complaints
over the years from the residents of
Albert Court Mansions about the
noise from the Union Building, the
College has finally coughed up an
estimated Â£11,000 to double-glaze the
Lounge and Concert Hall. The
Lounge took three days to refit, the
work should have been completed by
Wednesday evening, by this time the
contractors had only just started on
the Concert Hall which has around
three times the window area of the
Lounge.
B R I E F
Price increase
T H E PRICES in the Union Snack Bar
(Norman's) are to go up on Monday
according to Deputy President Alan
Rose. This, claims M r Rose, is to
cover increased costs from suppliers
and increases in staff pay which will
come into effect soon. Norman
Jardine, however, claims he has no
knowledge of the price increases.
Norman did confirm that half
portions will not be served anymore
as, in his view, "students have been
taking advantage of the system". He
would like to see a 'strict' policy on
prices and portions.
Cuts predicted
S T A F F C U T S may be necessary due
to Government cutbacks the A S T M S
warned yesterday. The Governing
Body has recommended that staff
levels should be reduced by at least
100. It is hoped that this will be made
possible by some staff over 60 retiring
early.
Students banned
T H E T W O S T U D E N T S who were
involved in the assault on Union Bar
Manager Adrian Johnson have been
banned from all bars in College.
