T H E QUESTION of censorship of IC
Union publications has been amicably
settled at the meeting of Publications
Board last Monday. Members of the
B o a r d , including heads of
publications and the I C U Executive,
unanimously approved a new motion
stating that the Editor of the I C U
Handbook should have final say on
the contents of the Handbook, but that
an 'open committee' should be set up
to advise the Editor and allow all
relevant points of view to be
considered. This motion will now be
submitted to the next U G M as an
amendment to a previous motion
which had suffered many
amendments put forward by Ian
Howgate at the last U G M .

TUESDAY'S Union General Meeting (UGM) is to be held in the Junior
Common Room (JCR), and not in the traditional venue, the Great Hall.
The Union Executive took the decision in the hope of attracting a larger
audience, after only 100 students turned up at the recent Freshers' UGM.
The meeting will start at 1pm, with the added incentive that College
will be providing free chips from the QT Burger Bar with every Imperial
burger sold between midday and 2pm. This makes good a promise made
by ICU President Ian Howgate during his first election campaign last year.

T H E FIRST new-style Phoenix is to
be published at the end of November,
it was decided last year that Imperial
College Union needed to produce an
arts and literary magazine but, due to
poor sales of the previous annual
issues, they decided to produce a
pamphlet containing poetry, prose
and photography five times each year.
The last annual issue is available from
the F E L I X Office at 50p.
ICRPeril
A W I L D story of death and
destruction shocked College on
Tuesday, when IC Radio's Southside
Studio was engulfed in a small cloud
of smoke.
A minor fault in the studio
headphone amplifier was the culprit.
A small potentiometer burnt out and
caused the early dimise of the
lunchtime show.
The dedicated team of IC Radio
technicians soon repaired the fault,
closely watched by a group of
worried, and grief-stricken DJs.
A n IC Radio spokesman said later
' W e only lost 15 minutes of
programming out of 100 hours per
week, and if you blow this out of
proportion I'll cut off your boll**ks!

IT IS L I K E L Y that the Government's
new housing benefit scheme will
result in losses of over £2 per week
for IC students. Students in other
parts of the country will be hit much
less severely. The scheme comes into
effect in April 1988. IC students with
under £3000 savings will have to
contribute 20% of their rates bill.
Those with £3000 to £6000 savings
will have to pay £1 for every £250 or
part thereof held. The rate at which
the rent section of the benefit will be
withdrawn with increasing savings
will be increased to an even higher
level than the Government first
proposed.

S I N C E October 19 eight bicycles
have gone missing from College,
most being stolen from outside the
Science Museum Library. Geoff
Reeves Security Chief at College
pointed out that none of the bikes had
a proper cycle lock, which are
available from College for £16.25. It
takes only a few seconds for a chain
or cable to be broken by a
professional thief. Wallets are also
being stolen from around College.
College Security advise all students
to be careful and not to leave bags and
jackets unattended.
