THE A TRE
Thunderbirds
Mime Theatre Project
(Bloomsbury Theatre)
This is your last chance to see
Thunderbirds as you've never seen it
before; in mime. This hit of the
Fringe returns to London for five days
due to popular demand. How can two
people perform an entire adventure
featuring Thunderbirds and Captain
Scarlet? In fact they manage
brilliantly with a combination of fast
action, quick changes and
atmospheric music.
The story includes a l l the
memorable moments from the series,
an assassination attempt on the World
President is foiled by Captain Scarlet
and International Rescue save him
from a train balanced precariously on
a bridge which has been sabotaged by
the mysterious M r X . A l l your
favourite characters appear in some
guise or another, Lady Penelope,
Brains, Jeff, Parker and even
Stingray's Marina.
Technically the mime is superb in
its own right, for example the
portrayals of crashing waves or huge
waterfalls are convincing, and with
the added advantage of such a well-
known series it is fabulously detailed
(remember the collapsible palm trees
on the launch of Thunderbird 2). Any
pauses are neatly filled with the well-
known music which cleverly evokes
the atmosphere of the original.
The energetic duo are moving on
to new ground in the shape of 7

Actually
More from the dull duo in the same
successful style as Please. This time
there's more gloss and less content,
with the same mix of depression disco
and embarassing ballad. Great singles
(It's a Sin, What Have I Done to
Deserve This, Rent) and the tongue-
in-cheek S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G We're
Shopping makes up for the
embarassing It Couldn't Happen
Here. Well crafted pop with just the
right measure of self-consciousness
and intelligence.

Live
Bryan Adamsâ€”Wembley
After the sweet, raunchy melodies of
T'Pau in the first half of the show,
Bryan Adams had a lot to do to
maintain the quality of this show.
Bryan bust on to stage in a modest
black shirt and blue jeans, and from
a distance looked not unlike IC D P
Alan Rose.
Swirling rhythm and blues guitar,
solid rock drumming and of course
MUSK-
Bryan's gruff yet tuneful vocals all
went together to make the perfect
ingredients for an exciting and
atmospheric concert (shock-
atmosphere at Wembley Arena!)
The show was made up of the best
of his last two albums Heat of the
Night and Reckless, with a few old
favourites thrown in for die hard fans.
The best reactions of the night were
given to songs like Reckless, Run to
You, Somebody and Summer of 69
which was excellent as the finale.
The new songs are not quite as
commercial, with fewer out-and-out
rockers, they do however show a lot
of maturity and of course still
maintain that killer hookline.
My personal favourite of the night
(if you exclude the lead singer from
T'Pau) was the moving Nature Sons
a song for the American Indians
which makes you sit back and simply
think.

Who's That Girl
That girl is Madonna playing Nikki
Finn, who having just been released
from gaol, crashes head first into the
well ordered, successful and
extremely sensible life of Loudon
Trotts (Griffen Dune), completely
destroying it within a few hours. O f
course the result is a transformed
wacky and exciting Loudon.
It is a film full of stereotypes:
Madonna is as usual a tarty streetwise
version of Mickey Mouse; the rich
father; two hoodlums; the plain
clothed cops; the highway patrolmen;
the dumb fiance; the disgustingly
wealthy eccentric and a Rolls Royce
that gradually gets wrecked, all
combining to make an unremarkable
and predictable film. Undoubtedly
Madonna will get some bad press for
this film, and none of the rest of the
cast deserve to receive an oscar for
their performances.
However, despite all this I did find
myself laughing out loud on a lot of
occasions, and if you don't expect too
much, you won't be disappointed.
Who's That Girl is fun but I just wish
that everybody hadn't fallen in love
at the end.
