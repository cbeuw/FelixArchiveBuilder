F " EEI I
This week has been one of those
nightmare weeks where there's too
little space with too much to put into
it. Not only this but all the Print
Unit machinery has gone
haywire—this may mean that I will
have to be selective about what goes
into FELIX for the next few weeks.
Special Rag Issue
In two weeks time (13.11.87)
FELIX will be devoting itself to
Rag Week. 25% of income raised
through advertising in that issue will
be given to Rag. We will also be
charging at least 20p to Rag for
each small ad or diary entry we
print. Please support our efforts by
putting as many small ads in as you
can possibly afford!
Next week's issue will preview
all the events lined up for Rag
Week.
Soul Searching
In this week's issue we have printed
yet another article about the soul.
This will be the last one as the
subject is now getting a little
hackneyed (geddit?). I suggest that
the rest be left to Debating Society.
No Censorship
Last week I was asked why FELIX
has stopped printing the President's
report on the Union page. It seems
that many of you believe that I am
refusing to include anything written
by him. This could not be further
from the truth. Sad to say, Mr
Howgate has not submitted a
Presidential Report to me since the
Freshers' Issue.
Southside Fire Alarms
Those damnedfirealarms went off
again this week in the early hours
of Monday morning. I had just put
my dressing gown and slippers on
and locked my door when it was
switched off. This alarm fiasco has
been going on ever since I've been
at College. Never fear, though,
you'll know when the fire's a real
one: all wardens have been
instructed to shout up the staircases
and from Princes Gardens 'It's a
real fire. Get out!'. Whoever
thought that one up has less brain
power than Dave Tyler. With the
I alarms cutting out all other sounds,
how are we meant to hear the odd
warden shouting at us from the
gardens? So until College finally
sort the whole system out, my
advice is don't ignore the alarms
and listen out for your frantic
warden's voice!
Electronic Media
The first meeting of Publication's
Board this year met last Monday.
I was saddened to hear that both IC
Radio and STOIC are suffering
from their massive membership
fees. IC Radio has only 28 members
so far, IC Radio is meant to
broadcast over 100 hours each
week. You don't need an '0' level
in Mathematics to work out that
some people have to do an awful lot
of broadcasting to maintain the
output required. The electronic
publications may not serve as many
people as FELIX but they still
provide a valuable service. I think
it's time to realise that publications
are different from other clubs at IC
and that any person should be
allowed to contribute to these
services without having to pay out
of their own pockets.
Print Unit
There is now a month's waiting list
for printing. If you are a
club/society and you need printing
for early December/Christmas you
ought to see me now.
Sweatshirts
The sweatshirts have now arrived
in the FELIX Office. They're
extremely tasteful and make good
Christmas presents
Staff
Anyone is welcome to attend our
staff meeting today, 1pm in the
Office.
