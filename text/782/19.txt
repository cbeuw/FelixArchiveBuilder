Spiritual
crossfire
IC Film Soc presents All of Me
Thursday November 5,
7.00pm, Mech Eng 220
Roger Cobb (Steve Martin) is a lowly
attorney with a high-powered law
firm who'd rather be a jazz musician.
Edwina Cutwater (Lily Tomlin) wants
to live longer, and arranges with a Far
Eastern mystic to be transferred into
the body of a lusty young woman.
When Roger visits Edwina to revise
her will, he gets caught in the spiritual
crossfire—and Edwina ends up
controlling the right-hand side of his
limbs. His right leg takes dignified
lady-like steps; his left strides ahead
boldly. He talks to himself in an
imperious falsetto and his own
baritone. T o everyone else in the
world, he's gone crazy. And so starts
the hilarious film All of Me, starring
top American comedian Steve Martin,
star of The Jerk, Three Amigos, and
the forthcoming Roxanne.
Don't miss this hilarious comedy.
"Karate is my life"
On Thursday October 22 Sensei Dave
Hazard, a 5th Dan and former British
C h a m p i o n , visited Imperial's
Shotokan Karate Club. Over 50
people turned up to train with M r
Hazard and benefit from his unique
brand of teaching.
The lesson was split into two
parts—the first catering mainly for
beginners, while the second half of
the lesson was for advanced students.
The session started with the basic
moves fundamental to karate; proper
execution of punches, kicks and
blocks were taught and these were
then applied during sparring. The
advanced class consisted o f
combinations of punches, kicks and
blocks, with much importance being
placed on speed and power.
Throughout the lesson Sensei
Hazard stressed the need to develop
a good martial spirit, and great
emphasis was placed on 'Kime' or
focus. The evening ended with a
series of hard hitting strikes and
blocks being exchanged between
A Plain Man's Guide to
High Energy Physics
(Get rid of as many elements as you can!)
In particle physics we try to reduce
the number of elements as far as
possible.
Earlier in the century, when we
were first discovering the elements
of matter, electrons and protons
were just about all we knew.
Since then, to say the least, the
number of known particles has
increased drastically.
With the introduction of quarks
and gluons we have attempted to
"This is eternal life: that they may know you
the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom
you have sent" John 17:3
make the subject manageable.
But at every level of physics God
demonstrates his greatness; we will
never really understand nature.
In man's search for God - what
we call religion - we are in a similar
dilemma. God is so great that we
will never discover what he is like
by our own efforts.
In Jesus, God reaches out to us
so that the number of elements is
reduced from infinity to one.

Sensei Hazard and Sensei Caesar
Andrews the C l u b ' s regular
instructor. Sensei Hazard has had a
long and distinguished career i n
Karate and runs his own club i n
Brighton. After the lesson he took
time to discuss some of his views on
karate.
A strong believer in traditional
karate, he stresses that without history
and tradition there is no karate.
Although Sensei Hazard praises those
who practice karate solely as a sport
and admires their athletic activity, he
maintains that those who show a good
balance between fighting, Kata (pre-
set moves against imaginary
opponents) and basics will be strong
in karate for life. Above all, Sensei
Hazard believes that the quality of the
karate performed depends upon the
practitioner and his enthusiasm.
When asked what karate meant to
him, Sensei Hazard replied simply
'Karate is my life. It is the vehicle I
use to live.' Throughout the evening
Dave Hazard endeared himself to his
students with his combination of skill
and sense of humour, making it a
pleasure to train under him.
