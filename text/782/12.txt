THE
HIGH
GROUND
Satellite
technology has
given a new
twist to the
arms race. Spies
in the sky
increasingly
dictate nuclear
strategy. Dave
Burns takes a
look at the race
to control the
Final Frontier.
Nothing New
One of the major principles of warfare
through the ages has been one tactical
advantage of possession of the higher
ground. Once the space race had
commenced in the fifties, it soon
became apparent that the ability to
place satellites in orbit around the
Earth gave those nations with such
advanced technology the use of the
ultimate in high ground. It was
inevitable that the arms race would
spread into space.
Since 1958 more than 2200
satellites with actual or potential
military uses have been launched.
Once launched, the satellite itself
becomes a target, leading directly to
the development of anti-satellite
weapons. In turn these anti-satellite
weapons have immediately
complicated the arms negotiation
situation by becoming potential anti-
ballistic missile systems.
Some 75% of all satellites are
launched for military purposes. The
launch rates for both the U S and the
Soviet Union have become constant
over the last few years, indicating that
the two super powers now have as
much satellite capability as they
require. What then are the uses of
these satellites, and what are the
prospects for future military
expansion into the final frontier?
Nuclear Strategy
Advances in space technology have
included improvements in space based
sensors for surveillance,
communications, command and
control system, and space based
navigation aids to enhance the
accuracies of delivery systems for
both conventional and nuclear
weapons systems. Such advances
have led to changes in tactical
doctrines for nuclear war. Over past
decades nuclear doctrine evolved
from the idea of Mutually Assured
Destruction, the infamous M A D
policy.
This has now been transformed into
the flexible response strategy which
allows for the maintenance of M A D ,
as well as the ability to counter attack
with 'flexible, controlled use of
strategic weapons against appropriate
targets for any attack at any level of
conflict'. This is known as the
Countervailing Strategy, and is born
out of the high accuracies of weapons,
the precise knowledge of targets, and
increased warning of attack made
possible by military systems in space.
The flexible response doctrine
requires good command,
communication, control and
intelligence (C3
I) systems. The way
in which satellites fulfil these roles is
discussed below.
Reconnaissance
The U S budget for reconnaissance
and surveillance from space was
thought to be about Â£1.3 billion in
1986. The importance of eyes in the
sky is enormous. The genre started
with the U S A i r Force Big Bird
satellites. These high resolution
photographic reconnaisance satellites
have orbital lifetimes of up to 180
days. More recent KH-11 satellites of
the U S have lifetimes of up to 1166
days. With the vast array of
reconnaisance satellites in orbit, the
time intervals between observations
of a point on Earth can be drastically
reduced. The general pattern now is
that Big Bird satellites are sent up to
investigate areas indicated to be of
particular interest by the KH-11
satellites. Photographic satellite
reconnaissance can reveal troop
movements, military installations,
even new designs of Soviet Aircraft.
In contrast the Soviet Union have
relatively few long lived
reconnaissance satellites, most have
a life of about 14 days.
While much is known about
photographic satellites, comparatively
little is known about current
electronic reconnaissance. These
satellites are designed to be military
ears in space. They monitor radio
signals generated by the other side's
military activity throughout the
world. This covers everything from
military communications between
bases, early warning radars, air
defence and missile radars to missile
testing, new radars, in short, all types
of electromagnetic emission. Here,
the source of signals can be located
by navigation satellites, using
methods resembling hyperbolic
navigation in reverse. Instead of using
four transmitters on four satellites to
locate an object, four receivers on
four satellites can locate the position
of an unknown transmitter on Earth.
Ocean Surveillance
Another element of C3
I is the use of
ocean surveillance and oceanographic
satellites. Ocean surveillance satellites
are used to track naval movements,
while oceanographic satellites are of
enormous help in increasing
understanding of various ocean
properties, knowledge which is
invaluable in anti-submarine warfare.
Ocean satellites also have a subsidiary
function in detecting ocean launched
missiles.
Explosion Detection
The U S A has launched satellites for
the specific detection of nuclear
explosions in the atmosphere and in
outer space. It is now intended that
the N A V S T A R location system will
carry sensors of the Integrated
Operational Nuclear Detection
System (IONDS) to provide damage
assessment both within" ones own
country and within enemy territory
during and after a nuclear attack. This
is designed to enhance the early
warning, size assessment and data on
attacked targets in order to give
greater flexibility of response.
