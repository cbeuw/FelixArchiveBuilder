Communications
Communications satellites form only
part o f the elaborate defence
communications systems of the
military. However, the US is placing
greater emphasis on satellite
communications, particularly with
nuclear forces. The existing space
component in the U S communications
system consists of transponders
aboard satellites such as the Fleet
Satellite Communications satellites
( F L T S A T C O M ) , as well as other
satellites in polar orbits.
Since satellites are becoming an
essential part of C3
I, it has become
important to make them survivable.
The U S A i r force has proposed a
satellite for this specific purpose,
called S T R A T S A T , which would
orbit at an altitude of about 203 720
k m in order to increase its
survivability. It would also include
extra resistance to jamming, and a
manoeuvering ability. Although the
satellite itself may become more
resistant to attack its ground facilities
remain as vulnerable. It is also worthy
of note that all the satellites electrical
systems are vulnerable to nuclear
attack even without a direct hit. Pulses
of neutrons and gamma rays seriously
affect semi-conductor devices. It is
because of this that strenuous efforts
are being made to harden both the
ground and space elements of C3
I
against nuclear attack.
Anti-Satellite Systems ASAT
With so much time and effort being
devoted to protecting one's own
satellites, it is hardly surprising that
an equal amount of time is being spent
determining how to destroy the
opposition's satellites.
The Soviet Union's efforts in this
direction centre around the less than
subtle approach of having a satellite
move alongside its target, before
blowing up. This method suffers from
being a costly and strictly once only
usage of a satellite. It does have the
advantage of being very difficult to
detect. It is almost impossible to know
if a satellite is, in effect, a mine until
it's too late.
The U S takes a more direct
approach with its anti-satellite
weapons, relying on miniature
homing vehicles launched on a missile
from high altitude, about 20km. It can
be used as a direct ascent system
against any satellite in any orbital
inclination and this combined with its
small size makes it very survivable.
Initial trials with the system from an
F-15 fighter have achieved reasonable
results.

Recent Developments
The 1983 Korean Airline incident was
linked to US satellite activity over the
area at the same time. The U S
electronic reconnaissance satellite
1982-41C was over the Kamchatka
Peninsula at the same time as the
airliner entered Soviet airspace. It has
been suggested, more frequently by
the Soviets, that the whole incident
was an exercise by the U S to monitor
Soviet reactions.
Soviet ocean satellite launches have
increased their knowledge of the polar
ice cap and this has led directly to the
Soviet U n i o n developing the
capability to launch submarine
launched ballistic missiles through the
Arctic ice cap.
The Soviet Union has also tried to
increase the duration of flight for its
reconnaissance satellites. They had
been experiencing problems with
satellite recovery, but are now using
digital image transmission to
overcome this.
Space Weapons
The strategic importance of satellites
has spurred-on research into even
more elaborate methods of destroying
them. This has burgeoned into the so-
called Star Wars system, the intent
being to place weapons in space to
deprive the opposition of the high
ground. Huge amounts of expenditure
is now being devoted to this aim by
both super powers. Current space
weapons can be divided into two
groups, kinetic energy and directed-
energy weapons. K E weapons derive
their destructive energy from the
momentum of a propelled object. In
directed energy weapons, energy in
the form of electromagnetic beams or
particle beams is the destructive
element.
Kinetic Energy
Two types of K E weapon are being
investigated—the so called mass
driver and the electromagnetic rail
gun. The mass driver was first
proposed as early as 1966. A
travelling electromagnetic wave is
used to accelerate a mass which is
preferable ferromagnetic o r
superconducting. The mass is
accelerated through a series of coils
while held in magnetic levitation. The
greatest disadvantage is the
comparatively modest accelerations
produced at each step. Currently, to
accelerate a mass of 0. l g to 150 km/s
would require a 2km accelerator.
The more promising device is
called the rail gun. A current is
allowed to flow down two rails, with
a partially conducting armature placed
perpendicularly across the rails. The
projectile is placed in front of this.
However, the mass of the armature
limits the acceleration. This has been
overcome by using a plasma, caused
by electrical discharge between the
rails, as the armature. Various more
complex methods of increasing the
efficiency of these weapons are under
investigation. However, none of these
weapons have the immediate prospect
of becoming space based, and their
extreme cost has directed the major
space weapon efforts in the field of
beam weapons.
Directed-Energy Weapons
In the field of directed-energy
weapons, laser beam weapons are
holding centre stage.
Among chemical lasers, the
chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL)
seems suitable as a weapon. The
C O I L transmits at wavelengths of
1.3 m. In such a laser, energy is
transferred from excited oxygen
molecules produced by a chemical
reaction. Its main advantage is that
easily handled liquid fuel can be used.
Plans to build a 50kW C O I L are
underway.
X-ray lasers make a very attractive
space weapon prospect because of
their short wavelength. Two major
problems complicate their
application. A considerable amount of
energy has to be used to raise the
energy levels in the atom. Second, the
probability of stimulated emission
decreases sharply as the wavelength
of radiation decreases.
A further complication is that the
lifetime of excited states is
proportional to the wavelength
squared. This means that atoms would
stay in the excited state for as little
as 10_ 1 3
S. The necessary conditions
can best be created by use of a
powerful pulse of x-rays generated
from a nuclear explosion.
Clearly once again, this is a once
only use weapon. The problems of
beam direction and multiplicity would
seem almost insurmountable.
However, research continues.
Arms Negotiation
The proliferation of satellites with
i military uses, and the consequent rush
to develop space weapons to destroy
them, has produced a paradox. The
current state of military satellite
technology makes verification of arms
limitation treaties a relatively simple
affair. There is just nowhere to hide
anymore. Unfortunately, the
associated rush to produce the so-
called Star Wars systems on both
sides has held up the very same
process of arms limitation.
I While satellites hold both the means
to wage nuclear war and the means
i to prevent it, there can be no easy
solution to the problem.
