Heroic rowers save
woman from Thames
Two members of the Imperial College Union Boat Club were acclaimed
as "heroes," after rescuing a drowning woman from the River Thames
on Wednesday afternoon. The woman, who was in her mid-sixties,
was found unconscious in the river near Fulham Football Ground.
It is believed that she may have been trying to commit suicide as she
was fully clothed.
Steve Pierson—branded a hero on Wednesday
The incident occurred while
members of the Club were
practising on the river near to the
Club Boathouse in Putney. The
coxless fours team was approaching
the boathouse when they noticed a
person apparently swimming in the
water. It was only after the boat had
passed the body that they realised
she was in fact drowning. Steve
Pierson (Mech Eng 2) dived from
the boat and pulled the woman to
the river bank, while another of the
oarsmen, Vincent Roper, also dived
in to try to help her. The boat was
rowed to the shore by Rob Gee and
Nick Leigh.
Once at the bank, Steve gave the
woman 'mouth to mouth'
resuscitation. In the meantime, the
crew's trainer Mr Bill Mason
brought blankets for the woman and
her rescuers. Four police cars and
a police launch then arrived, having
been alerted by a member of the
nearby Barn Elms Boat Club who
had witnessed the incident. These
were followed by an ambulance.
The woman, aged 65, was
conscious when taken to hospital,
although she was shaken and very
confused.
Rob Gee, Captain of the Boat
Club and Chairman of the Union
Athletics Clubs Committee, said
that the woman would not have
survived in the water if the incident
had occured in Winter. The
temperature of the water was about
12°C on Wednesday, which was
exceptionally warm for this time of
year.
Rob told FELIX yesterday:' 'You
can classify Steve and Vince as real
heroes—the genuine article!"
