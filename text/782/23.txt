EVERYBODY WELCOME!
ABORTION:
In defence of
PATA
Dear Editor,
I feel that I must defend P A T A against the accusations
made by Kemi Adenubi in F E L I X (16.10.87), and
particularly the charges that P A T A should not criticise
abortion and were not primarily interested in positive
alternatives to abortion.
During the last academic year, I was its secretary. P A T A
had two inseparable aims: to inform people about the
nature and effects of abortion and to promote more
constructive options than killing the human foetus. The
first aim was an essential prerequisite to the second,
because unless people are fully aware of the destructive
effects of abortion on mother and child, they are not likely
to face the all too obvious difficulties presented by
children. Whilst people continue to promote abortion as
a panacea and refuse to discuss its damaging effects, P A T A
members may well feel encumbered with informing people
about the nature of abortion.
It\vas also rather disingenuous of Kemi Adenubi to
suggest that P A T A did not place great emphasis on the
positive ways of dealing with problem pregnancies. To
our knowledge she has not obtained any of our literature,
other than a single leaflet, or attended any of our meetings.
If she had, she would have soon discovered that one of
our main concerns was to promote the non-directive
councelling and other services provided by L I F E (487
4776). Indeed their telephone number was prominent at
all our stalls, and occasionally noted, if somewhat
discretely, by young women.
In the face of somewhat simplistic treatment of the
difficulties involved in abortion, we have tried to present
a complete and honest picture of the alternatives available
to someone faced with a problem pregnancy. I hope that
P A T A will continue to do so, and in particular that the
caring help and philosophy of L I F E will become more
widely known, perhaps through the services of F E L I X .
Yours faithfully,
Paul Rice, PATA Secretary (1986/87).
Being with
potential?
Dear Judith,
Kemi Adenubi tells us she is 'pro...the mother's life'
( F E L I X Oct 16). Along with a few lines explaining this
position the rest other article lambasts Imperial College's
Positive Alternatives to Abortion Society and makes the
tentative suggestion that were the enormous abortion
figures broken down into particular categories they might
become much more acceptable to us all.
I do think, personally, that the key to all these issues
lies basically in deciding whether or not the foetus is a
member of the human species and whether or not one ever
has the right to directly cause the end of the life of such
a member. M s Adenubi's few lines with regard to this
area tell us '...every fertilised egg is a potential human
being. The woman is an actuality, a human being who
has been existing independent other mother's womb for
quite some time' and that pregnancy 'wreaks major
changes in her body and life especially on her standing
in society' and thus that she has the 'right' to choose 'safe'
abortion'.
What kind of science is in use in suggesting that the
foetus is a 'potential human being' rather than a human
being with potential? What concept of 'rights' is in use
that makes 'independence' a clinching factor? What type
of 'society' are we supporting that allows one section to
decide that they have the right to step on another to further
their progress? What are we doing to a woman undergoing
'major changes in her body', in the inherently natural
preparation for motherhood, in supporting riping into this
process? Is all this really 'safe'?
If we believe in 'rights' and compassion and want to
exercise them I do think we should be a bit careful and
ask some of these questions. I too, I would note, am 'pro'
the mother's life.
Yours sincerely,
Hugh MacKenzie, Civ Eng RA
Positive
Alternatives
Dear Judith,
In reply to the opinion article 'What Positive
Alternatives?' ( F E L I X Oct 16) I would like to ask Kemi
why, if she is concerned about abortion issues, she hasn't
attended any of P A T A ' s meetings? If she had, she would
have discovered that P A T A , although predominantly male
(which reflects upon IC) has a higher proportion of female
members than IC—16%. However, abortion affects both
men and women so the relevance of the ratio of male to
female members of P A T A seems small to me. Further,
our first talk given by Pat Gallagher (a Life/SPLC
member) on October 15 this year, entitled 'Positive
Alternatives to Abortion', answered several points that
Kemi voiced.
Kemi and anyone else are most welcome to come along
to P A T A ' s meetings and voice any positive criticisms or
ideas as we are always willing to hear them.
Yours sincerely,
Rachel Dowling (Secretary of PATA).
Silly letter
Dear Judith,
Have any of your readers noticed the remarkable
similarity between I C U President Ian Howgate and Zippy
from 'Rainbow'.
Yours sincerely,
Rainbow Fan.
