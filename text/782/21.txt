Cup
IC I I - 1 7
Q M C I V - 0
What can we say! A game of 2 halves.
Q M C started defiantly, holding out
with 10 men for 15 minutes, before
Pip Peel sneaked the winner. 16 goals
later, jugs were offered by Paul Stott
(4), Neil Vanderbegin (3), Pete Rick
(3). Other scorers; Adam Thomas (2),
Pip Peel (2), Rakesh Muthoo (2), Jezz
Holland (1).
First class seconds
IC II—8
Sussex—2
Another game of 2 halves, each
lasting 45 minutes. Again, Pip Peel
was the opening scorer, as IC cashed
in on early pressure. A defensive slip
10 minutes later, let Sussex through.
However, Mike Plummer, was there
to callously chop the forward down.
The ensuing penalty was converted to
equalise IC's early goal. After another
10 minutes the scoring started. Adam
Thomas put IC back in the lead, but
straight from the K O Sussex
equalised. Again, straight from the
K O , Adam was there again to restore
IC's lead. The 2nd half started with
a bit of pressure from Sussex. Then
came the turning point in the game.
Sussex's centre forward raced
through, but Russ Dark, obviously
lacking speed chopped him down. He
carried on, but his shot past Simon
Holden was cleared off the line by
Russ straight away, IC rushed up field
to bury Sussex, with Paul Stott
opening his account. Eventually, 4
goals later, IC were 8-2 victors, with
other goals from Paul Stott (3) and
another from Adam Thomas.
First win
K C H II vs IC V
IC V s managed their first win of the
season in a cup match against King's
College Hospital ( K C H II) last
Saturday. M i s s i n g regular
goalkeeper, Captain Jon Turner
played in goal and looked set to keep
a clean sheet until 15 minutes before
full time.
By this time IC were 2-0 up thanks
to two goals from Bas Basma, one in
each half. It was a good all round
performance and a much needed
victory after a poor start to the season.
The final score was 2-1.
Unlucky own-goal
On Saturday, IC 3rds travelled away
to Egham to play New College's 3rd
team in the cup. When we finally
arrived—via 3 motorways, due to Rob
Kelly's navigation—IC started well,
but could not convert the early
pressure into goals. New College then
got back into the match, but conceded
an unlucky own-goal with about 10
minutes to go until half-time.
In the second half, both teams
started well and after 15 minutes,
New College equalised with a
spectacular curling shot. The game
then flowed from end to end with both
sides going for the win. Then with 15
minutes left, Paul Neville socred for
IC from a corner and Imperial
survived the late pressure to hang on
to the 2-1 win. They now play U C
2nd in the first round proper. Chris
Burton played well in front of the
biggest crowd of the season (his
girlfriend) but man of the match was
goalkeeper Julian Henson with
several good saves.
Football appeal
Wanted: Football Managers
I am looking for someone in Mech
Eng, Elec Eng, and Civ Eng who
is interested in putting a football
team together to play in an inter-
departmental tournament on
Sunday mornings.
If the response is positive,
games could start by the end of
November.
Please contact James Wilson,
Chem Eng 4, if you are interested.
Any people who would like to play
football for IC, or played in the first
Wednesday trials but have not been
picked for a team, please sign their
name on the Football Club notice
board (between the Union Bar and
Union Snack Bar). Our apologies for
the confusion and to anybody who has
been left out, this has largely been due
to the cancellation of our second trial.
Any problems please contact any of
the committee through their
department pigeonholes.

CROSS COUNTRY
Selection confusion
So far this year the Club has had
two outings. The first was at the
Oxford Polly Relays where we
managed to enter two teams,
fortunately there was a race once
we got there despite the storm on
the previous night! Everyone had a
good run and finished close
together in 8th and 9th places
respectively. There was some
confusion over selection but this is
only to be expected on the first
outing and the performances
promise well for the future.
The team were placed as follows:
Alex Gaskell 34
Dave Knight 39
Mike Jones 63
John Porter 73
Ramin Dilmaghanian 75
Richard Hardiman 77
Graham Messenger 92
John Rowland 98
Stefan Ledin 106
Philip Gribbon 109
Angus Davison 133
Just one question, where are the
women? C'mon girls! See you on
November 4 for race two of the
L o n d o n Colleges League in
Guildford.
LADIES HOCKEY
Strong opposition
IC vs Sussex (UAU)
This important match was postponed
from Wednesday. Things started to
go wrong when the goalkeeper turned
up an hour early, found no-one there
so went home. The game started well
for IC with the ball spending most of
its time in the oppositions half. This
didn't last long! Very soon Sussex
began to put pressure on IC.
After half time Sussex lifted their
game and not even a stalwart defence
especially from M Faldor and demon
use of the offside rule could stop
Sussex scoring 3 goals.
One consolation eoal was scored
from a penalty flick from S Hodgson
making the final score 1-3 to Sussex.
U L 7-a-side
Imperial entered two teams for this
competition, owing to the weather it
proved to be the first serious hockey
to be played by the ladies this season.
Some good goals were scored by S
Hodgson and P Ottway. The rest of
the team played with great enthusiasm
Organisation of the tournament left
a lot to be desired, however after a
process of elimination and scoring
which I still find incomprehensible,
one team came 6th (out of 24) and the
other team was unplaced. Finally
many thanks to Spence for umpiring.
