Selective
wins the
prize
This year's prize is shared between
three people for their work on some
compounds that are very fussy about.
what other sorts of molecules they
associate with. These compounds are
useful because they can be used to
selectively encourage certain difficult
reactions and they can be used to
discriminate, and therefore separate,
certain very similar metals in
solution. The three people who got
the prize are: Charles Pedersen (who
worked for DuPont central research
labs in Delaware); Donald Cram
(University of California at Los
Angeles); and Jean-Marie Lehn (who
is French).
The story started when Pedersen
was trying to make some industrially
useful chemical. Because of some
gunk in his starting materials, he
produced (as well as what he wanted)
a small yield of crystalline impurity
with unusual properties. Most people
would have thrown the annoying side-
product away, and used purer starting
materials next time, but most people
don't win Nobel prizes. Pedersen was
a curious man and he investigated the
strange new compound. It turned out
to be a compound now called dibenzo
(18)crown-6 which has some strange
properties.
The structure of the compound is
the key to its strange behaviour. Once
Pedersen had realised what the
structure was, he was able to design
more similar compounds to perform
different chemical roles. Cram was a
consultant for DuPont at the time, and
he realised that the compounds could
be used to do some very selective
reactions.
The simplest of the compounds are
rings containing CH2 groups and
some oxygens. (18)crown-6 has an
18-membered ring with 12 CH2
groups and 6 oxygens, hence the
name. The compounds are called
crown ethers because, in their three-
dimensional structures, they often
look like the things royalty put on
their heads. More complex versions
of the compounds were devised by
Lehn which contain nitrogens and can
therefore have three interlocking rings
seduction
chemistry
(this creates a cavity more like a glove
than a ring). These compounds are
called cryptands and hold on to metal
ions even more tightly than the crown
ethers. Even more complex
compounds have been devised since
with structures that have to be seen
to be believed.
Adulterous but fussy molecules
The unusual chemical properties of
the compounds result from their
adulterous (but non-promiscuous)
relationships with certain charged
ions and molecules in solution. They
are able to seduce other specific
molecules away from their rightful
spouses and encourage them to set up
new homes in solution.
Normally in chemistry it is difficult
to coax charged things into solution
in neutral inert solvents. The trouble
is that ions in solids such as common
salt (consisting of Na+ and C 1 - ) are
happily married, and need some very
strong attractant to get them to split
up (they need something attracted to
them more strongly than they are
attracted to the crystal lattice). Water
can dissolve some salt because the
highly dipolar water molecules are
strongly attracted to the ions and can
therefore crowd round them and
attract them out of the crystal lattice.
Less polar solvents have great
difficulty in attracting the ions from
the lattice, so you can't get salt to
dissolve in benzene (which has no
dipole to keep the ions happy). Most
common organic solvents have this
problem, which is a pain because in
some compounds that are not soluble
in water.
In organic solvents the rule is like'
dissolves likfe, so compounds that are
mostly carbons and hydrogens will
dissolve in solvents that are mosdy
carbons and hydrogens. This is why
crown ethers are so useful. Inside the
ring they are adulterously attractive
to things like potassium ions (because
of the dipoles caused by the presence
of oxygens on the ring) but on the
outside they just look like any old
hydrocarbon because all the solvent
can see is the CH2 groups. So it is
possible to sneak ionic species into
previously inaccessible places.
But the particular quality of crown
ethers that is useful is their selectivity.
The size of the hole decides which
ions fit inside. And, when something
fits, it fits really tightly: for example,
potassium ions just cannot resist
18-crown-6. In an organic solvent in
contact with a salt, so many
potassiums are lured from the crystals
that the previous spouses (counter
ions in chemical jargon) of the
potassium ions will also come into
solution in a futile attempt to regain
their lost loves, so the crystals will
dissolve.
The forsaken loves of the potassium
ions can be put to good use. For

2-2-2 cryptand—fits like a glove
•example, the permanganate ions
(Mn04 - ) from potassium
permanganate or the hydroxide ions
from potassium hydroxide, will
wander naked searching for their lost
loves in non-polar solutions
containing 18-crown-6. These ions
are agitated enough to participate in
reactions that cannot normally be
done in such solutions.
But crown ethers are very fussy.
Solutions of mixed ions can be
separated by the use of a crown ether
that complexes only one component
in the mixture. 15-crown-6 will cling
to sodium ions for dear life but will
tend to leave potassium ions alone
(they are slightly too large to fit in the
hole, but otherwise they are very
similar to sodium ions). This can be
very useful industrially in the
separation of mixtures of similar ions.
Extremely fussy molecules
Compounds similar to crown ethers
have become increasingly important
in the years since the compounds were
ifirst noticed. Their cavities have been
Idesigned to seduce many different
types of compound. Work involving
Imperial C o l l e g e , Sheffield
University and ICI has shown how
paraquat (the compound that kills
weeds when you put it on your
garden, but kills people when you
store it in lemonade bottles) can be
held i n the cavity o f
bisparaphenylene(34)crown-10 (there
will hopefully be a report on this work
in F E L I X soon). The holes inside
some of the compounds have been
designed to take only one mirror
image of some reacting molecules,
thereby promoting reactions of only
one isomer giving biologically useful
products (when molecules can be
either left- or right-handed, nature
always sticks with just one hand).
This is very useful in the drug
industry where, for many drugs, only
one optical isomer is active (for
example, only one of the two isomers
of dopamine, the compound used to
treat Parkinson's Disease, is useful.
In building molecules with such
abilities to discriminate between other
similar molecules, chemists are
beginning to learn how to mimmick
nature. Enzymes (nature's chemical
companies) can tell the difference
between very_similar molecules and
can produce products containing
molecules of only one handedness. It
would make some important
chemicals a lot cheaper if we could
copy nature's methods.
We should never forget that none
of this chemistry would have been
done if a single chemist had not been
curious. So curiosity may sometimes
kill the cat, but it feeds the chemist.
