OK
Anyone who was here last year and
read F E L I X letters can probably
remember the fervour over College
having a Lesbian & Gay Welfare
Officer, which resulted in Robert
Daniels and then Andrew Bannister
sitting on the Union Council last year.
Unfortunately they have left College,
so this year I have volunteered to try
and do the job, and the Council has
generously co-opted me as a non-
voting officer.
People who weren't here last year
or who didn't follow this last year
might wonder what I'm supposed to
do. Well, I don't know either, but
what I will try and do is.
1. Sit on Council meetings and see
that IC's Lesbian and Gay interests
are represented.
2. Be there for anyone who wants
to talk to me (especially if they want
to ask me to dinner).
3. Hopefully help people to realise
that lesbian, gay and bisexual people
exist at IC and that they are normal
people (not infurious queens!).
If anybody wants to talk to me
contact me through the pigeonholes
in the Mech Eng Foyer (James Papa,
Mech Eng II) or come to the meeting
in the Green Committee Room,
Wednesday 12.30pm, we are going
to elect .a Chairman and other
committee members soon.

Also could the following people
please contact me about their extra
cover from last year as the insurers
re-calculated the premium to take
account of vacations which should not
have been paid for in the premium.
I will be able to explain further if you
could please contact me.

As Mark Harris is the only candidate
for U F C , he will merely require
ratification. For those posts requiring
an election, each candidate and/or
proposer can speak for a total of two
minutes.
Papers f o r the other posts
advertised are still up as there are still
insufficient candidates. Each set of
papers will come down five days after
a fully proposed and seconded
candidate is received.
Publicity rules are available from
my office. I will take a very dim view
of anyone flaunting them.
Parking Permits
Anyone who has been allocated a
permit and who has not collected it
by 5.30pm on Monday November 2
will be assumed to longer require it.
A list is available in the Union Office
for anyone who is unsure as to
whether they have been allocated a
permit. Anyone wishing to query the
decision of the Allocations Committee
should see me, not Kathy Tait the
Union Receptionist.
