A Nightmare on Elm Street-
Part 3 Dream Warriors
Surprise, surprise, Freddy's back
again. For those unfamiliar with the
Nightmare series, Freddy Kreuger
(Robert Englund) was a child
murderer who was burned alive by a
group of vigilante parents and who
subsequently returns to terrorise their
children in their dreams, complete
with grisly appearance and razor-
tipped right hand. This time the
unfortunate teenagers are all locked
up. in the local asylum after they
become violently fearful of sleeping.
Fortunately, a specialist in dream
disorders (well I didn't spot it at the
Careers Fair) in the shape of D r
Nancy Thomson (Heather Langen-
kamp) arrives, and by coincidence is
the sole survivor of a group of
teenagers who suffered the same fate
back in Nightmare I. A s they are
gradually killed off, Nancy leads them
into a combined attack on Freddie.
Meanwhile, the caring D r Neil
Goldman (Craig Wasson) is involved
in a race to locate Freddy's earthly
remains guided by Nancy's father
John (John Saxon).
Dream Warriors sees the return of
Wes Craven, the writer of the original
Nightmare, but don't let that fool you
into thinking it might be goodâ€”this
latest sequel has none of the
originality of the first. Despite a
promising beginning (which even had
me wincing at one point) the film
rapidly descends into a kind of 'Five
go mad in Dreamland'.
A momentary glimpse of Zsa Zsa
Gabor serves no purpose, the title
song by Dokken and inevitable
soundtrack are gimmicks which do
nothing but highlight the incoherent
plot and paper-thin stereotypical
roles. I'd rather have an early night.
A.N.
Eat the Rich
Eat the Rich is the second feature to
come from the Comic Strip stable,
following on from the deservedly
successful Supergrass. However,
although directed and co-written by
C o m i c Strip founder Peter
Richardson, the usual gang (Nigel
Planer, R i k M a y a l l , Robbie
Coltrane...etc) have all been given
minor roles, a clever move
considering the amount of exposure
they've had elsewhere recently.
Eat the Rich is a portrayal of
Thatcher's Britain exaggerated to
farcical extremes, exemplified by the
hilarious character of the Home
Secretary, 'Nosher' Powell, an ex-
heavyweight boxer, who's solution to
almost any problem from terrorist
sieges to Union leaders is a sharp left
hook; and whose opinions are
summed up by his statement on
television that "some people in this
country are very rich, but most of you
are very poor. You're all lazy
bastards."
Apart from Nosher the plot follows
the adventures o f A l e x , the
horrendously camp ex-waiter at
'Bastards', a restaurant where Panda
steak is on the menu and people leave
50 quid tips, who is now down-and-
out, tramping the oppressive and
lonely London streets. Driven to
desperation by a social security clerk,
Alex decides to start a peoples'
uprising, whereupon he becomes a
victim of the machinations of
Commander Fortune, a Russian spy
trying to depose Nosher. Joining up
with a group of three other totally
inappropriate revolutionaries and
armed with bows and arrows, they
take over 'Bastards', change the name
to 'Eat the Rich' and start serving up
the customers, but are eventually
revealed by Fortune in an attempt to
scandalise Nosher.
Eat the Rich is over the top in
almost every way, from its rather
obvious allegorical treatment of
Britain today, to the pounding
soundtrack of Motorhead and yet it
all seemed to fit together quite well.
The comedy is patchy, the plot giving
the impression of having been
constructed around a few clever ideas,
but some of the scenes were so fiinny
I thought it was worth getting through
the slower ones. What makes the film
work are the ridiculous characters (of
which there are plenty) and who are
all excellently portrayed; especially
Alex (Lamar Pellay), her gang (Ron
Tarr, Jimmy Flag, Fiona Richmond)
and of course, Nosher. Not as good
as Supergrass, in the end, but
definitely good fun. Incidentally the
film is brimming with celebrities
playing minor roles, apart from the
Comic Strip team. See if you can spot
any of the following: Angie Bowie,
Jools Holland, Paul McCartney,
Sandie Shaw, K o o Stark and Bill
Wyman!
