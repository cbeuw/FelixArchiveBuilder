Another twist in The Saga
of The Writing-up Student
Graduates from elite universities four times
more likely to be in the highest pay bracket
Afonso Campos
A survey conducted by the Institute of
Education at the University of London
has led to the official and fairly unsur-
prising conclusion that graduates from
the top universities in the country earn
signficantly more than those hailing
from former polytechnics and lesser-
ranked institutions.
According to an Education Guard-
ian story, graduates from places such
as LSE, Oxford, Imperial, Cambridge,
UCL, St Andrews, Durham and Edin-
burgh have been found to be four times
likelier to earn more than all other uni-
versity leavers. About 1 in 5 of these
graduates earn at least £90,000 a year,
compared to 1 in 20 from ex-polys.
This is very likely to be linked to the
fact that graduate recruiters tend to be
amongst the highest paying employers
and they happen to recruit almost ex-
clusively from top ranked institutions.
The universities previously mentioned
have a very high proportion of students
entering graduate employment at plac-
es like investment banks, management
consultancies and companies such
as Proctor and Gamble, GlaxoSmith-
Little Timmy can’t work out what the hell is going on either...
A myriad of police officers arrived outside the Sir Alexander
Fleming building on Wednesday afternoon when security guards
stumbled upon a suspicious bag. Four police cars turned up
according to one onlooker, and the entire building had to be
evacuated for approximately 30 minutes to secure the area.
Thankfully, the offending item was no more than a suspicious bag.
Although the incident proved to be a false alarm, police officers
reassured the security guards that they “did the right thing.”
Kline, etc.
According to the survey, roughly 1 in
3 students who left these universities in
the mid ‘90s own the house they live in,
compared to 1 in 5 for graduates from
other universities and just over 1 in 10
for non-graduates.
These findings are likely to bring
comfort and distress to Imperial stu-
dents. Comfort to those who are al-
ready certain that they will sell their
soul to the city when they graduate
and distress to those who will sacri-
fice a large pay-packet for a career in
science.
Earlier this term Felix reported on the
apparent success of former writing-up
student, Matthew Yong, in his bat-
tle for Council Tax exemption against
Camden Council. Mr Yong was re-
quested to attend court on 20th March,
but literally before entering, Camden
Council withdrew the summons. A
few weeks later he was issued with an
official Summons Withdrawal Notice,
which Felix even printed a copy of in
issue 1,401.
Mr Yong was set to sell his story to
this paper, but he was stopped in his
tracks when Camden Council took a
U-turn on their decision. After writing
to his council for confirmation that a
line could be drawn under the ordeal,
he received a letter on 6th May stating:
“I regret that the Council stands by
its decision not to award you full ex-
emption between 4 July 2007 and 5
January 2008.”
According to Camden Council, Mr
Yong owes them £804.52 despite being
issued with the Summons Withdrawal
Notice.
Felix contacted Camden Council in
an attempt to determine what the hell
is going on, but this author was met
with cries of “Data Protection Act.”
Mr Yong says that he doesn’t have
time to keep dealing with the Council.
He has written to the NUS (National
Union of Students), the NPC (National
Postgraduate Committee) and the Un-
ion seeking funding to help him pay for
any further legal costs.
The trial continues...
