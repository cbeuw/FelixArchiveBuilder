Imperial student finds Sainsbury’s
bakery: annual profits soar by 28%
S
upermarketchainSainsbury’s
has recorded an increase in
profits of 28%.While mar-
ket analysts have linked the
strong growth to the comple-
tion of a recovery plan set out in 2004,
evidence from Imperial College seems
to indicate a stronger force at work.
Imperial student Ross Goldberg
didn’t take long to seek out sugar, hot
buns and delicious french treats. Un-
fortunately, he was at Imperial, and had
to settle for artery-clogging pastries in-
stead of sexy girls called Helene.
His daily trips to Sainsbury’s became
ever more extravagant, he would often
spend upwards of £50 on sumptuous
6-pack-destroying goodies. Soon he
was transformed from the rippling
god on the right, to a man whose at-
tractiveness is only slightly above the
average of Imperial students.
As his waist grew wider, Sainsbury’s
share price similiarly rose. Soon busi-
ness analysts around the world were
talking about the ‘Fatty Factor’, while
McDonalds bosses were livid that they
had missed a trick.
Ross became an instant celebrity, re-
ceiving offers from shitty food outlets

D
id you vote for Mat-
thew Taylor in the recent
CGCU elections? Yes?
You should be ashamed
of yourself.
I’m sure that Mr Taylor is a gentle-
man and a scholar, but... sorry, I’m try-
ing to think of a funny way to say this.
Never mind, his poster is just terrible.
What the HELL are you doing Matt?
The slogan ‘Break the Imperial mould’,
would be more inspiring if he had made
any attempt with his poster. Is it really
that hard to make posters that are crea-
tive, aesthetically pleasing; at the very
least a poster that INCREASES your
chances of being elected?
It appears that CGCU disagrees
with me. Matthew was actually elect-
ed. I know, I was pissed off too. It’s
obvious that, rather than me being
wrong, engineers actually celebrate
dull, colourless and bland creations.
Did I mention they were engineers?
But don’t fear, readers, you’re not
doomed to this fate. There are a few
useful tips, that if you keep in mind
should prevent a slow, painful death
1) USE COLOUR DAMN YOU!
2) Avoid engineers
3) Don’t run for election... ever

his fat face in their establishments.
Unfortunately, this story does not
end well. Like the dot-com bubble, Ross
was destinied to burst. He was stabbed
one night returning from Sainsbury’s.
Congratulations Ross Goldberg, you
beat it man, you beat heart disease.

Marquee creates jobs, devours students
C
unning observers may
be able to notice two
things about the severe
awesomeness that is the
stealth marquee on the
Queen’s Lawn. One, quite macabre, the
other one, not much so.
It has come to the attention of the
contributors to this section, that Impe-
rial College has single-handedly creat-
ed a free-marqueet system for the Mar-
quee setting-up contractors, which this
year has been put up and taken down a
grand total of 631 times. According to
Blink and you’ll miss it!
the Office of the Rector, the College is
now worried that the increased mar-
ket for marquee Putter-Uppers will
translate into an imigration problem
of unprecedented proportions. It is
known that Englishmen have problems
getting it up, and foreign-trained mar-
quee putter-uppers would be in better
shape to erect it on Queen’s recently
trimmed turf.
It also appears that during each of
these quickies where the marquee van-
ishes, some students are gobbled up
by it, and it is not clear where they are
stored. The rumour mill is abounding
with horror stories of zombie physicists
being used as slave labour by the dra-
conianly efficient DPFS, Chris Larvin.
The Deputy President denies all claims
with a sick smirk on his face. His girl-
friend was unavailable for comment.
WE LOVE LIVE!

Editor elect – a little girl?
Apparently, the future editor of this orgasmic publication has
decided to give up his degree in engineering or whatever, in order
to take up his childhood sissy passion of knitting and sewing.
“Sewing is useful, yeh bruv?”... no bruv...
