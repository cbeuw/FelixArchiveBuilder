Virgo
You get more
depressed when
you remember that
you actually didn’t
have any promise
as a child. The only
reason you got into Imperial is because your
name is Richard Sykes Jr and they needed you
to bump up the female:male ratio in Materials.
That’s right you’re an 18 year old girl called
Richard, there’s nothing left for you to do
except give blowjobs and do gape porn.
Scorpio
This week... btw
one of the editors of
Felix is so fit. Who
is it? Lets narrow it
down. It’s a female
editor. Ok so there’s
like 10 editors who are of the fairer sex (and
who don’t find any of these horoscopes funny
coz they often involve the words gash, face and
cunt). If you figure out who you are, and who I
am, lets get it on. Yehya, HELLA, manana.
Libra
This week you
remember how
much you love gape
porn. Run back to
your room, lock the
door and indulge.
Except you’re not in your room, you’re in the
SAF and you’re not indulging in gape porn,
you’re watching the Pain Olympics online. Go
on, I know you’re curious, google it. Beware, if
you didn’t like 2 girls 1 cup... well you’ll see.
Sagittarius
This week you (i.e.
Robert Winston)
are caught reading
Felix. Chill Winston
weez won’t tell no-
body, but you got to
give us something in return. I quite like your
moustache, that would be payment enough: or
maybe one of your titles; you don’t need to be
a Lord, Sir and Professor all at the same time.
We could discuss it over some dinner and a
dip in your jacuzzi. FYI, we luvs you Winston.
Capricorn
This week the level
of bitching around
you reaches feverish
heights. The gossip
is moving at light
speed, literally. I
mean you hear the scandal before you see the
persons mouth move. You could put things in
perspective by reminding them about famine
but you realise that the vapid sons-of-bitches
don’t have souls, so theres no point... fizzbitch.
Cancer
This week you are
in front of a first
year Physics class.
Nearly all of them
are below-average
looking guys. Hey,
a really hot girl... no that’s just the effeminate
long haired geek in row 3... I’ll never get laid,
maybe I should change course, Biologists lock
up your ladies and throw away the key. This
horoscope is far too true for comfort... sigh.
Gemini
This week some
douche tries to
talk to you about
drugs. He says he’s
representing some
kind of cat. You get
worried when he starts asking you about how
much skunk you light up weekly. You shift
uncomfortably, clenching that eighth in your
jacket pocket. You breakdown in tears, shout
‘fine just arrest me!’ and run away into the
road and get run over. YOU SEE, weed KILLS.
Leo
This week you
reveal to a total
stranger how
fucking stupid you
are. According to
you, the recent
changes in the classification of marriage-jew-
wanna mean that you can’t ‘smoke outside
any more.’ I mean OMG wtf omgz zomg.
Theres nothing else to say in the rest of this
horoscope... you had such promise as a kid.
Taurus
This week your
greatest fear ma-
terialises in your
bedroom. Your
laptop sprouts legs,
arms and a perm
and starts raving to MGMT – Time to Pretend
(OMG awesome). When you awake to find
this technological nightmare, you calmly light
a cigar, take out a pistol and unload 6 shots in
its memory board. I told you Macs were evil.
Aries
This week you die.
I’ll be so depressed
if a student dies
now... crap, right
let’s make an
agreement, neither
one of us will die, ok? What do you mean, you
can’t keep that promise? Just stay away from
terrorists, buses and guys named Mark. Yeh
you’ve got to watch out, they’re right cunts...
Sorry, just one guy called Mark is a cunt.
Pisces
This week theres
could be a NUS
referendum, or wait,
maybe not. Eugh,
there are more
interesting things
to do with your life people!!! Remember when
you were a kid and you went out with your
friends not doing anything interesting but it
was ok coz you had your friends? You don’t?
Oh you didn’t have any friends, so that’s why
you’re heavily involved in the Union... cunt.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
This week, the guy
who writes the
horoscopes over-
hears you discussing
his work with those
vapid imbeciles you
call friends. He decides to use your conver-
sation for material. making you extremely
paranoid. When was that? Where did I have
that conversation? OMFG I’m being watched
aren’t I? Yes... yes you are.

Needy McNeedy: tweaking nipples since ‘78
2
4yo F, GSOH, masochist,
enjoys laughing at others’
pathetic problems and then
publishing said problems in
student newspaper, seeks
troubled M for future columns. If in-
terested email agony.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. I’ll tell people we met at your
therapist’s.
Dear Needy McNeedy,
My flatmate and I are doing a PhD in
the same research group. I see him all
the time, at home, in the office, in lab,
in the Holland Club...
All aspects of my life are now linked
to this guy who can’t help talking about
science all the time. I knew being a
PhD student was uncool, but I had
never imagined it would be totally de-
pressing. Is my social life condemned
for the rest of my time in London?
PostgradInDistress
Dear PostgradInDistress,
No. Your relationship has clearly
reached saturation point, and your
flatmate, being the kind of person (they
are oh-so-common at Imperial) who
can only just distinguish between the
facial expressions of the insanely jubi-
lant and the clinically depressed, needs
to realise this.
Given how hard it is to explain the
concept of emotions to the uninitiated,
I suggest you take matters further and
subtly get him to decide to hang out
with you less. A few ways you could
do this are: make a move on him (if
he isn’t gay, find out first or this could
backfire), get a girlfriend with some re-
ally annoying characteristics, or take
up strict religious practices which co-
incide with his daily routine. He’ll soon
decide that he’s better off without you,
and you’ll be free to continue your life
unabated. (Doing a PhD is, in fact, not
cool. You might want him back at some
point.)
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
My best friends have finished all their
work and keep asking me to go out
with them and get drunk, but I’ve got
loads of stuff to do. They make me feel
like such a loser. How can I study and
still keep up my cool image?
UpsetMedic
Dear UpsetMedic,
Wanting to spend time studying au-
tomatically makes you pretty uncool.
Writing a letter about your “problem”
to fictionalised agony aunts in your col-
lege paper has pretty much pushed you
off the scale of cool and into a slag pit
with croc shoes and people who watch
Big Brother. You might as well just put
a bit more effort in and get a degree.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I’ve been on a couple of dates with this
girl from my hall, and things are go-
ing really well, she’s really pretty and
funny and we’ve had a really good
time. I’m quite traditional, and even
though some of my mates have taken
the piss out of me for not sleeping with
her yet, I’m standing by my decision to
wait for a bit and get to know her first.
The trouble is, the longer I leave it un-
til we have sex, I get increasingly nerv-
ous, and I don’t get turned on thinking
about it. How can I make sure I don’t
lose my nerve (and my hard on) on the
big night?
FrightenedFresher
Dear FrightenedFresher,
This is why it is always best to get the
whole sex thing out in the open as early
as possible in a budding relationship
before issues like this build up. Always
put out on the first date, girls!
You’ll need to drink heavily on the
date in question to make sure you’re
less worried/numb the pain when
things inevitably go wrong. Also, try
and find your most arousing sexual
fetish so that if you start getting floppy
you can close your eyes and think of ex-
ams/men/the Rector and wait for the
results… Good luck!
