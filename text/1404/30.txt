Guess who’s back: it’s Di-Emma, who
managed to win last week’s crossword.
Good to hear from you ladies, wel-
come back.

After a hugely successful season for the
Hockey Club, including a whole stash
of silverware and the first full year
for the newly elected President (Mark
Roberton), it was capped off on Satur-
day during the annual President’s Day!
The general idea was to eat, drink, play
hockey and catch up with all those old
faces...
An early start was required for such
an epic day and more than one ULU
Hockey Club Member (who also play
for IC) missed the 9.30am bus to the
Fortress due to their annual dinner
only finishing at 4.30am that morn-
ing! However the show went on and
the hockey started with a bang… and
a siren…and a horn! Some surpris-
ingly decent hockey was played with
many nursing hangovers and the rest
having not picked up a stick for a few
months (or a few years in the case of
the old boys). With the tournament in
full swing and the roasted pig and lamb
arriving courtesy of The President the
rain started… after a week of scorching
sun the typical British sun had been
substituted for grey clouds and a brisk
breeze. But the club members (new
and old) have been hardened week in
week out playing at the barren-wind-
swept landscape that is The Fortress
Harlington. The play went on and an
interesting mix of spritely youngsters
and clapped out old gits had reached
the semis. The youngster team, The
Ringers, were to play the all granny
Gaol Pie!, while the mid-aged All Stars
took on the great-grandfathers of the
tournament Imperial Strangers… but
first it was time for a spot of lunch!
The hog and the lamb were devoured
by the hungry players while Nedic led
the way in hacking up the meat.
The Semi-Finals resumed and the
youthful teams pulled through to the
grand-final. By now most had drunk
one or two pints and the club’s most
recent member Mr. M. Phone was at
hand to amplify any abuse the merry
supporters had to give. Even though
both teams were still trying to digest
the copious amount of meat consumed
at lunch, the pace of the game was high.
The Ringers went up by two goals but
a dramatic substitution by the All Stars
captain meant the score was all back
square at the final whistle. Extra time
and sudden death penalty flicks could
not separate the teams, and in a dra-
matic announcement by The President
that, it was decided that the winner of
the tournament would be decided by a
boat race, which was agreed upon by all
present. Back up at the bar, the FA Cup
Final finished and the selected mem-
bers from each of the finalist teams
got ready for a swift coxless five race…
the competition was certainly not as
close as the hockey with The Ringers
seeming to sink even before they had
started, and the All Stars cruised in for
a 2 length victory!
The evening saw even more fun back
at the Union Bar where generations of
ICHC Legends discussed their times
at the best club in College! The Club
would like to thank Mark Roberton
(ICHC President) for hosting such a
great day and we will all be back next
year for more beer, meat and hockey!
Hockey Club President, Mark Roberton
