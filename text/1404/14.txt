NUS Referendum
Last Monday Union Council accepted
a proposal to hold a new referendum
on NUS membership. This will give
the student body of Imperial College
the chance to debate the merits of
continued affiliation to the National
Union of Students. Imperial joined
this organisation in 2006 for the first
time since the late 1970’s and this
exercise will provide students with
the opportunity to re-evaluate our
membership of the National Union of
Students. The debate itself will not take
place on the Union page but I would like
to communicate some basic information
about the process itself. A provisional
voting timetable is given below and the
returning officer will be Ally Cott who
can be contacted at dpcs@imperial.ac.uk.
Someone has already volunteered to
lead the pro-disaffiliation campaign but
in the interests of promoting a fair and
thorough debate I would like to request
that any student who is interested in
running the anti-disaffiliation campaign
to contact the Returning Officer as this
position is still vacant.
Timetable (provisional)

Colours 2008
Please get your nominations in before
Tuesday. A lot of students have done a
lot of excellent work this year to make
life at Imperial better for thousands of
their peers and now is our opportunity
to formally acknowledge this. If you feel
that anyone you know has in your opinion
gone that extra mile to support Union
activities then the Colours Committee is
keen to hear about them.
What are Colours?
Colours are a type of award that Imperial
College Union can give to anybody to
recognise the service, contribution and
dedication of someone to the Union.
There are five types of Colours that
are broadly separated into two groups.
The first three Colours, which are Half
Colours, Full Colours and Outstanding
Service Awards, are awarded in
recognition of one year’s service to the
Union. The other two Colours, which
are Fellowships and Distinguished
Fellowships, are awarded in recognition
of many year’s service to the Union.
Who can be nominated for Colours?
Anybody can be nominated for these
awards, except the Union Sabbatical
Officers and the Felix Editor.
Who can nominate someone for
Colours?
Any Imperial student can complete a
nomination form, but it’s best not to
nominate yourself!
What happens if you are awarded a
Colours
Being awarded a Colours is a great
honour and privilege. Those who receive
these awards are presented with an
award certificate at a ceremony, a tie
or pin, and in the case of the higher
awards a gift like an engraved tankard or
Honorary Life membership of the Union.
The Union keeps a record of all the
people awarded Colours.
What do you need to do to be
awarded a Colour?
To be awarded Half Colours you need
to have made a “positive contribution
to the general life of the Union in an
extraordinary fashion.”
To be awarded Full Colours you have
to “repeatedly, through outstanding
achievements, over the course of the
year, have made a significant contribution
to the life of the Union.”
For an Outstanding Service Award
“you will have displayed continuous
outstanding achievement across a broad
spectrum of Union activities.” Few of
these are given out, only five a year at
most.
The Fellowship and Distinguished
Fellowship awards are much harder
to get as they are are based on the
contribution the awardee has made over
a length of time.
To receive a Union Fellowship award you
need to “have continuously served the
Union in an exceptional manner.” Very
few of these are
given out.
To receive a
Distinguished
Fellowship you
need to have
“served the Union
in a selfless and
dedicated manner
which is both
exceptional and beyond reproach.”
If you don’t know which award to
nominate someone for then choose
the one you feel is appropriate and
the Colours Committee will change if
necessary.
How can I nominate someone?
Nominations are open from Tuesday
6th May 2008 to midnight Tuesday 27th
May 2008 at 12 noon. Nomination forms
can be downloaded from the website
imperialcollegeunion.org and can be
emailed to colours@imperial.ac.uk.
You’ll have to give the name of the
nominee, the award you are nominating
them for and tell us, in less than 200
words, why you think they should get it.
Also include your name and CID.
What happens then?
Your nominations will be considered
by the Union’s Colours Committee
and then the results will be announced
towards the end of the term in Felix and
successful nominees will be given their
awards at an Colours ceremony in June.
