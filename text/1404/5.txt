Politics
being a Class C drug.
I agree, and think that just emphasises
the fact that this appears to have been
a political decision.
Since cannabis was declassified,
has there been a change in drug
culture?
Use has gone down; there has been a
long term fall in use. You could say it
has gone down because of the declas-
sification, people thinking it is not as
good. I wonder if it is partly education.
Also maybe skunk is less pleasant to
take. Maybe it is because less people
smoke, it’s harder to take cannabis
without smoking so reduction in smok-
ing could mean a reduction in cannabis
use. Cocaine use is increasing. I don’t
think there is necessarily a link but it
is a possibility. Fashion is probably the
biggest influence on drug use. Maybe
people want to be different from their
siblings. If your brother smokes dope
and you want to be different, you take
coke. To some extent cannabis use may
be becoming “uncool”.
Do you think there is a place in
society for alcohol, tobacco and
other, illegal drugs?
Drugs are drugs and they ought to be
treated fairly as far as possible instead
of the peculiar position we are in today.
Tobacco is a very interesting example;
tobacco use has fallen quite a lot, driv-
en by public dislike for smoking and
the smoking ban in buildings. I think
if you want to stop drugs being used
it helps to make them unfashionable.
There are other ways, e.g. taxation, and
one of the problems with illegal drugs,
as you know, is you don’t have access to
such proven methods of control. Most
countries in the world have accepted
that taking drugs is a personal choice
and that we should not penalise peo-
ple for drug use but dealers should be
punished for selling drugs. I am quite
interested in the Dutch model where
cannabis is available in coffee shops
legally in a controlled fashion in a safe
environment. I think it’s a very inter-
esting idea and I don’t know why other
countries haven’t explored it as a way
of protecting kids who want to try can-
nabis from street dealers of other hard-
er drugs. That type of approach might
have some benefits.
Can you see it working for other
drugs?
It potentially could. It is an interesting
approach that should be explored as an
option.
Recommendation 7 advises
schools to develop policies relat-
ing to substance abuse. Do you
see this including universities?
When we talk about that we talk about
education establishments including
universities. I think they should have
explicit policies on all drugs and that
should include alcohol. Alcohol proba-
bly does more damage to students’ pro-
gression than cannabis. They should
be educating kids but also encouraging
them to seek help if they get into prob-
lems. I think kicking people out is, par-
ticularly at schools, a hugely dangerous
thing to do. Once kids are kicked out
of school what else have they got to do
BUT take drugs? I think it’s dispropor-
tionate to exclude people from univer-
sity for taking drugs. If you applied it
fairly, then you’d exclude most people.
Even this government now has a policy
of harm minimisation so that’s what
education establishments should try
to do, to make sure that whatever they
do doesn’t cause more harm than the
drugs. That’s absolutely the first rule.
If you could start from scratch
with alcohol and tobacco, would
they be illegal and if so, which
class would you put them in?
There’s no question. Alcohol is similar
to GHB, currently class C. But in the
Lancet paper, alcohol comes up with a
lot of other class B drugs. Tobacco is
probably C because it doesn’t actually
cause damage through intoxication
like alcohol, the main costs
are health costs to the people
who smoke it and it is addictive.
In the report, cannabis
is said to be less
physically harmful
than tobacco.
What are the
reasons for
this?
It is actually quite complex. The main
reason is lifetime consumption of can-
nabis is much less than tobacco con-
sumption. So people generally smoke
between 3 and 6 joints a day as op-
posed to up to 40 to 60 cigarettes a day
so there is actually less consumption.
But harm per inhalation is harder to
know: I wouldn’t have thought there’s
much in it frankly, they’re all toxic sub-
stances that are burnt. Actually, can-
nabis burns at a lower temperature
so probably slightly less toxic per unit
inhalation.
Are there any psychological or
biological reasons for the preva-
lence of cannabis in certain age
groups?
That’s an interesting question. We
don’t really know why people stop us-
ing cannabis in their 30s. It’s one of the
research questions that needs address-
ing now. Why do some kids use can-
nabis? I think many want an alternative
to alcohol, they don’t want to be out of
their head, they want to be mellow. In
many ways it’s a very sensible choice.
You have slightly more control over
your life than if blind drunk. Why do
people give up? I would like to know.
I don’t know if the law has much of an
impact. I think some people get para-
noid when they smoke more. Maybe
you can ask your readers who have
given up cannabis,
why did they stop?
Is there a medical reason
why taking cannabis should af-
fect job prospects? For exam-
ple, Boris Johnson is known to
have been a drug user.
Well I think this is a really interest-
ing question that has never been
discussed in relation to drugs. It’s
been discussed in relation to al-
cohol; should reformed alcoholics
be allowed to take public office? Boris
does seem to have used a range of drugs
possibly including Class A ones. Jac-
qui Smith and many other cabinet and
shadow cabinet ministers have smoked
cannabis. That’s why I think this whole
business of penalties is ridiculous. If
for instance, the current Home Secre-
tary had been caught in possession of
a joint when a student and then got a
criminal record, she almost certainly
wouldn’t now be Home Secretary. As
she’s potentially quite a good Home
Secretary this would have been a waste
of talent. It’s quite pointless to lose
your opportunity to fulfil your talents
for such a minor transgression. I think
drug use – including alcohol - gener-
allly doesn’t impinge on people’s func-
tionng if they’re not dependent or mis-
using the drug currently.
Are there long term physical ef-
fects on the brain from cannabis
use?
It does change the brain but it doesn’t
appear to damage the brain. That’s true
of any addiction, addictions change the
brain in the sense that you behave dif-
ferently. In general drugs don’t physi-
cally kill brain cells but they do change
the chemistry of the brain. Everything
you do changes your brain, this con-
versation has changed your brain.
There is no evidence of irreversible
changes with cannabis. With meth-
amphetamines, alcohol and cocaine,
there may be long term changes after
dependence which means you can ar-
gue that addiction lasts forever. But
whether you really get addicted to can-
nabis in the same way as to alcohol or
heroin is actually quite an interesting
question. I’m not sure you do. We don’t
know whether aging “dope heads” still
crave cannabis. There is withdrawal
and physical dependence, no question
about that but cannabis doesn’t seem
to control people’s lives in the same
way as heroin and alcohol.
The report states that “to prevent
one case of schizophrenia in men
aged 20 to 24, about 5,000 men
would have to be prevented from
ever smoking cannabis”. How
strong is the link between can-
nabis use and schizophrenia?
Thereisalinkbutit’sweak.Ithinkthere
must be some genetic sensitivity. Any-
one can get psychotic just like anyone
can get drunk but schizophrenia is dif-
ferent. We suggested in the report that
the enzyme COMT might be a com-
mon cause because COMT is weakly
linked to schizophrenia and weakly
linked to cannabis psychosis. The
weakness of the
link of cannabis
and schizophrenia is
why the move to class
B is not proportional to
the harm of cannabis. The
impact on schizophrenia of stopping
everyone smoking cannabis would be
relatively trivial. We shouldn’t be inap-
propriately penalising cannabis users
- even locking them up - to stop other
people getting schizophrenia, which is
of course what some hard liners sug-
ggest. Arguing that stopping cannabis
use will stop people getting schizo-
phrenia is quite wrong.
According to a study by Frisher
and Crome, there has been a
decrease in schizophrenia in
the past 10 years. However, the
Telegraph reported that mental
health hospital admissions due
to cannabis have risen by 65% in
the past 5 years. How true is this
evaluation?
Schizophrenia is slowly disappearing.
Cannabis really doesn’t cause schizo-
phrenia but it can make schizophrenia
worse. If you’ve got schizophrenia and
smoke cannabis, you are going to stay
psychotic. So it doesn’t help if you are
schizophrenic and I think that’s what
the issue of cannabis and schizophre-
nia is about, if you’re schizophrenic
and go and get stoned then you get ad-
mitted to hospital because you become
more psychotic. So it’s not about caus-
ing schizophrenia, it’s about making it
harder to treat. We don’t know if there
is a reverse causal link, there is some
evidence that schizophrenics like can-
nabis. It may be helpful to them, per-
haps moderating the voices and other
psychotic symptoms. We don’t have
enough evidence.
Marjorie Wallace of Sane was
quoted as saying: “Urgent action
is needed to prevent an epidemic
of drug induced psychosis”. Is
this an over exaggeration?
There is no evidence of anything
changing. They are all just facets of the
same fear. It is possible that next year
suddenly the evidence will change. But
right now there is no good evidence to
support what she said.
Throughout the report the
similarity in severity of effects
between cannabis and Class C
drugs was drawn out. Based on
purely medical and scientific evi-
dence, should cannabis be a Class
C drug?
It should, yes. Based on the medical ev-
idence it should definitely be Class C.
“Arguing that
stopping
cannabis use
will prevent
schizophrenia is
quite wrong”
“Based on
the medical
evidence,
[cannabis]
should definitely
be class C”
Despite Recommendation 3, the government chose to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug
