Middle of the road tunes
from Royworld and Pigeons
These guys formed at Goldsmiths Col-
lege back in 2006, the London quartet
are tipped to conquer the music indus-
try in 2008 and beyond, currently ven-
turing into the music scene with their
second single: ‘Dust.’
Pinched from Royworld’s forthcom-
ing debut album ‘Man In The Machine,’
to be released on 2nd June, ‘Dust’ is an
easy number to locate on the musical
barometer. As far as the soundscape is
concerned, Royworld’s memorably lay-
ered keyboard driven melody, soaring
guitar lines, thumping drums, along
with frontman Rod Futrille’s crooning
vocals will easily entice old fans and
newcomers alike.
The song is definitely crafted in a
highly sophisticated manner and one
certainly gets the impression of the
band’s confidence through the way
in which everything is put together,
strangely, an epic, dynamic feel suf-
fuses this track.
Dust is a paradigm of Royworld’s im-
mensely fine songwriting talent. One
to watch out in the future.

We are Scientists’ new single has been
hailed as ‘a wave of pure charm...
f*cking awesome’ by NME. Couldn’t
agree more!
This emotionally charged stormer
taken from their chart topping sec-
ond album ’Brain Thrust Mastery’ that
plunged into the UK Album charts at
number 11, sees the duo sizzling with
deliciously raw, edgy sound, a concoc-
tion of sirenesque melodies, roofrock-
eting vocals, thrashing drums and
guitar franticness. The wholesome pic-
ture of indie rock and roll. Mind you,
the video for ‘Chick Lit’ is worthy of

Is this really an emergency?
The Pigeon Detectives certainly
claims so with their new single from
their novel album ‘Emergency.’
It seems that bands aren’t immune to
the “bus law” either. You wait ages and
two come along at once: noisy guitars,
fast paced hi-hat rhythms, and simple
shouty choruses; and I can’t help but
feel The Wombats do it just that little
bit better. The momentum of the track
carries you through to the riff-rich
chorus and the singer’s continuous re-
iteration of how urgent the situation
is. It’s the kind of infectious song that
will probably get a reasonable amount
of Radio 1 airplay, but I’m not sure
whether it has enough sustenance or
originality to make it last beyond a few
weeks.
If you’re after a loud sing-a-long
track and liked their previous songs,
such as I Found Out, then this might
be for you. However it’s a simple song,
with a simple outcome: all right.

After a three-year gap, Coldplay are
back with their latest offering – Viva
La Vida or Death And All His Friends
– and if their new single is anything to
go by, it might not be too bad either.
Violet Hill is the first single to be re-
leased off the album and is a rousing
introduction, with reverb-laden vocals
and thick electric guitars. You might
be forgiven for thinking “Oasis” when
first hearing the track, and whilst it’s
definitely Coldplay, there is something
oddly reminiscent of the Mancunian
band in the overall sound. It’s a far bet-
ter offering than their last lead single,
2005’s Speed of Sound, which was es-
sentially their 2002 hit Clocks with a
slightly re-phrased piano riff.
Singer Chris Martin leads us through
a tumultuous journey of snow and ri-
fle-wielding priests, interspersed with
the lyrical hook “If you love me, won’t
you let me know?” I’ll be honest – I’m
still trying to understand what he’s go-
ing on about, but in reality it doesn’t
matter. It works, and you soon find
yourself singing along.

T
ake any stereotypical im-
pressions of a rapper and
cast them aside when you
think of Ty, arguably one
of the most underrated
artists of his genre in the UK. Notably
absent from his three albums, released
with the pioneering hip-hop label Big
Dada, are the obnoxious bragging, de-
linquent potty-mouth, and paranoid,
yawn-some obsession with ‘the haters’
that seem to blight the majority of his
peers. In place of all this we find an
upbeat, soul-and-jazz-inspired blend
of thoughtful hip-hop that you find
yourself tapping your foot and smiling
as your head nods along in contented
agreement.
His lyrics are pensive yet witty, ma-
ture while retaining a refreshing el-
ement of playfulness. Neither is he
afraid to dabble in the political, draw-
ing references to topics ranging from
the 1994 Rwandan genocide to the
murder of the young Damilola Taylor.
Indeed, his long and active involve-
ment in London’s poetry and spoken-
word scene provide further testament
to his wordsmithery.
His live performances don’t disap-
point either. Whether performing with
a full live band or DJ, Ty establishes
a rapport early on with the crowd
through his energy and humour. At the
Jazz Café in Camden, he was joined by
not only a DJ, but also welcomed to
the stage an R&B singer, a soul singer,
British and Nigerian rappers and even
a lad playing the harmonica over the
hip-hop beats. Even the DJ couldn’t
resist stopping the records and joining
Ty in some impressive beat-boxing.
‘It’s all about people having a good
time’ said Ty after the gig. ‘I want
people to enjoy themselves, enjoy the
party. I don’t care who I bring on with
me, as long as I achieve that.’ True
enough, considering that he played a
gig with Damon Albarn only a couple
of days before and has recorded with
artists ranging from Albarn himself, to
saxophonist/rapper Soweto Kinch, top
London DJs Scratch Perverts and hip-
hop heavyweights Roots Manuva and
De La Soul.
A week before the Jazz Café gig
saw the annual Brit awards and Ty’s
opinion was rather frank: ‘It’s simple,
they’re killing music. All this pop-mu-
sic-industry back-slapping takes away
the focus from artists who take risks
and are innovative. UK hip-hop artists
are struggling to get the recognition
they deserve because the only way to
get recognised is to conform to the in-
dustry’s expectations.’ It is worth not-
ing that his inspirational sophomore

album Upwards was nominated for the
prestigious Mercury Music Prize in
2004, eventually missing out to Franz
Ferdinand’s influential debut.
Plans for 2008? ‘Recording.’ Trying to
tease out some juicy information about
style, timeline and collaborations was
difficult: ‘I’ll be recording but I don’t
have a particular agenda for it at the
moment: it’s still in the early stages. I
like to just take my time, make music
that I really feel, take the best tracks
and put it on a record.’ Judging from
his three previous outings, the new in-
stalment of the Ty musical saga will be
interesting listening indeed.

The return of Coldplay
There is something very catchy about
Violet Hill, be it the pounding drums
that carry you until the penultimate
chorus or the well-placed guitar riff
halfway through. Either way, it’s a solid
single at the start of what promises to
be a great album. Coldplay fans rejoice,
and music listeners enjoy.

attention too, funny entertainment to
say the least. Seemingly, it pays tribute
to ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street, Part III:
The Dream Warriors,’ and ‘The Good,
the Bad, and the Ugly,’ with both Chris
and Keith embracing the role of cattle
herders in the Old West. These musi-
cians, they really do just have a kind of
fetish for weird and wonderful back-
drops don’t they? I guess a change of
scene does no harm...
Having just finished the ‘Back in
Style’ tour across the country, the duo
are set to headline a night at Ibiza
Rocks in July, which promises to be
a real firecracker. Scientists have yet
again enlightened us with their dyna-
mite inventions.
