An ageing population issue
What happens to the economy when states cannot take care of those that need it
Afonso Campos

The ageing population is a highly com-
plex issue posing monumental challenges
notonlytotheUnitedKingdom,butmost
European territories as well. Alongside
the increase in the number of the elderly,
is a juxtaposed near-stagnation of teenag-
ers and children. Projections scarily show
that in the very near future, this age-band
will actually suffer a decrease. Two things
are absolutely essential; on one hand, it is
vital to unify all possible efforts to invert
this trend, while on the other, facing this
new demographic reality and solving the
consequences that with it follow is no less
of a need.
There are countless factors that drive
an ageing population, that is, an ever-
increasing number of old people facing
an ever-decreasing number of youths.
First and foremost, advances in science
and medicine in the past few decades
have provided the world with an increase
in life expectancy at birth. According to
some of the most recent data, this is cur-
rently at 78.5 years. Radical changes in
the population’s lifestyle are also a major
contributor to this. The most evident,
however, was the change in the status of
the woman, for whom being a housewife
is no longer the only option or mother
hood the only domain; women are fully
integrated in the workforce. This almost
‘forces’ the woman to conciliate her pro-
fessional activity with maternity, leading
her to have children much later.
Regarding principal consequences of
this change, the most obvious of all is a
visible decrease in the active popula-
tion. Another, a result of the latter, is a
possible collapse of social security in its
current form-factor. From this it follows
that there must be a significant change in
this paradigm. This proves much harder
to do than to say, given that in current
moulds, governmental spending on geri-
atric health care is mind-bogglingly high.
A diminishing quality of life of the elderly
also means that, legitimately and rightly
so, the active population must take care
of this age band. After reaching a certain
age, some people desperately require
constant and permanent care and homes
for the elderly are many times the only
option and optimal solution. Ideally and
utopianly, everyone should have access to
trulydignifiedhomeswiththeconditions
necessary for the provision of help on all
levels, including medical and social.
The great majority of these homes are
of a private nature and are not accessible
to all those that may need them. Thus, the
only ‘solution’ remaining is that of public
retirement homes. In fact, the term ‘so-
lution’ is nowhere near to the most ad-
equate word for the scenario, given that
these homes are invariably bursting at
the seams and thus without any vacan-
cies whatsoever. The official government
response that we are used to seeing
and hearing around us through
individuals and institutions,
is that it is very possible to
increaseinstantaneousva-
cancies. Even in this case,
the supposed solution is
not minimally useful or
helpful to those who
need a solution the
most as this method
of vacancy creation
comes in the form
of a ‘voluntary do-
nation required’.
In actuality how-
ever, this dona-
tion is anything
but optional or
‘voluntary’. It is
somewhat un-
derstandable, but
far from accept-
able. It is also
understandable
that if possible,
the elderly or their
families will do what
they can, within their
constraints and possi-
bilities, to put forward
the roughly £10,000 to
£15,000 as they consider
this preferable to the other-
wise long wait they would
have to endure.
The government currently participates
Afonso Campos
with roughly £370 per OAP, when their
spending can at many times be roughly
twice this almost pathetic amount. This
is not an acceptable practice on the gov-
ernment’s part given that it is neither just
nor egalitarian. If a retirement home is of
a public nature, it must offer access con-
ditions that are the same for all that may
require them. The role of the
government must be on one
hand, to assure the exist-
ence of necessary vacan-
cies through a change in
the policies of contribution
to homes on the behalf of
those that need it, and on the
other, to incentivate the crea-
tion of new homes through
state-private partnerships.
In a country the claims to
be one of the most devel-
oped in the world, it is not
acceptable that a low form of
bribery may exist, especially
in public institutions.
The government is
able to play many
roles in this are-
na; firstly, it must
assure the cov-
erage of costs
incurred by the
homes, and af-
ter this, create
an incentive
plan for new
homes. It must
alsochangeits
own partici-
pation plan,
in which the
real costs
of the re-
tirement
home and the
economic and fiscal situ-
ation of its users are taken
into account.

here hasn’t been a column
in a relatively long time.
Sorry about that, devoted
readers. Today, I shall give
you something a little dif-
ferent. Instead of incessant rambles
about how crap you are at making your
money work for you, or how much of a
hippie you are, I shall try to give a small
insight into how I think about the mar-
kets every month. It’s not a magical
formula – it might not work for you;
in fact it most probably won’t, but it
might give you a whisk of inspiration
if you will. It isn’t analysis of the past,
however, that makes money for some-
one; it’s the prediction of the future.
The idea here is that you make a sort
of educated guess where you try to un-
derstand where in the market are there
more gaps in knowledge. The way I see
it, if you are able to gather more infor-
mation than anyone else on a very spe-
cific topic, you are single-handeledly
contributing to the ‘perfect knowledge’
that markets supposedly have. That in
itself is epic. Knowing that you have
almost single-handedly outsmarted a
bunch of other people is a monumen-
tal feeling. Rant over.
For weeks the subject of commodi-
ties has been newsworthy and has fea-
tured in both finance and non-finance
publications alike. The increase in the
price of food has a great impact in the
budget of families whose resources are
stretched the most to begin with. At
the same time, the stock market and
the US dollar have been recovering
from losses from early on in the year,
removing some polish from the metals,
especially gold. In the field of fuels, oil
has remained at very high levels, lead-
ing to some investment professionals
speculating $200 barrels in the medi-
um term. I am still pretty bullish in the
commodities market. However, new
investments will be treated with cau-
tion given the crazy ride they’ve been
having, gaining almost 30% per month
to date with ridiculous amounts of
volatility. It’s good if you can stomach
it and don’t care about your Sharpe ra-
tio, otherwise you might want to hide
in a corner and look at it pass you by.
Do you have enough balls for months
of 12% gains even if it means a month
of 6% loss? While quantitative inertia is
looking pretty dandy, the volatility, like
I said, is killer.
If I were you, I’d be looking (I am) at
gold, silver and sugar. The easiest way
for you to go about buying these sexy
commodities is through any instru-
ments that have these as their underly-
ing vehicle. You’d be foolish to look an-
ywhere else but futures, really. The idea
of buying and keeping massive bars of
gold, like some still do in the East, is
heavily outdated. Why not go all exotic
and make what I believe to be a killer
trade? I would buy gold and hedge your
risk with a long USD position. Don’t
trust everything I say. You want to be a
good trader? Quit your crappy degree,
do something quantitative, subscribe
to The Economist, put your money on
the line and learn to not feel the pain
when it all goes to shit.
