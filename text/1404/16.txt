Research in Sweden reveals the world's oldest tree is a Norway spruce, previously thought to be a recent
arrival to the area where it was found. The secret to its longevity? An ability to clone itself, it seems...
Free will and independent thought
may be considered superior traits in
some circles, but for the welfare of a
community, consensus-based decision
making may be smarter. This, at least,
seems to be the result of new research
recently published by Dr Ward and
colleagues in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
"Quorum responses" keep animals
from blindly following the unsound
decisions of a maverick leader, allow-
ing them instead to reserve judgement
until a threshold number of their peers
do the same thing. While quorum re-
sponses have been observed for social
invertebrates like ants and bees, Dr
Ward and his collaborators believe
their experiment is the first time that
such behaviour has been documented
for animals with more complex nerv-
ous systems.
The study observed the behaviour of
fish in the presence of danger (a model
of a predator) and their reaction to
leaders, in this case, replica fish. In a
group of two, when a leader moved to-
wards danger, an individual fish would

Nine-thousand five hundred and twenty one, nine-thousand five hundred and twenty two... Blast ‚Äì where was I? No, this wasn't how Leif
Kullman found out his spruce tree's age: he used carbon-14 dating. Hmm, Leif... Was he destined to work on trees?
A new contender for the world‚Äôs oldest
living tree is a 9,550 year-old Norway
spruce found in the Darlana province
of Sweden last month. The spruce had
previously been assumed to be a fairly
recent arrival to the Swedish mountain
region.
‚ÄúOur results have shown the com-
plete opposite, that the spruce is one
of the oldest known trees in the moun-
tain range‚Äù, says Leif Kullman, Profes-
sor of Physical Geography at Ume√•
University.
Spruce trees survive the harsh
mountain weather conditions by re-
producing via clones, a feature which
also explains the long life expectancy
of the tree. The main trunk is usually
only 600 years old, but when it dies a
new trunk can grow up from an un-
derground root system to replace it.
The tree can also clone itself in winter,
when heavy snow pushes the low-lying
branches to the ground, allowing them
to take root and become new trees, ge-
netically identical to their parent.
The research team led by Kullman
used carbon-14 dating on bark and
cone remains under a spruce in Fulu
Mountain which revealed four ‚Äúgen-
erations‚Äù of tree: 375, 5,660, 9,000 and
9,500 years old. The remains were
found to be genetically identical to the
tree above them, and so are clones of
that tree.
Kullman believes that these spruce
trees may provide a useful insight into
climate change. As well as having been
around for a long time, the Norway
spruce also seems to respond to tem-
perature changes. It originally grew
in a shrub formation in the Swedish
mountain region, but has since evolved
a more upright trunk in response to
rising average summer temperatures
over the last 100 years.
Whether the spruce is the world‚Äôs
oldest tree is contentious. Previously,
the oldest recorded individual tree
(not a clone) was a 4,768 year old bris-
tlecone pine tree in the White Moun-
tains of California, according to the
Scientists have announced a novel
method of attacking the human im-
munodeficiency virus, HIV, the cause
of AIDS.
The study, a collaboration between
Boston University and the National
Human Genome Research Institute
(NHGRI), investigated the targeting of
a protein located on human immune
cells. Once targeted, the virus was una-
ble to infect these cells. Eric Green, the
director of the NHGRI, said that ‚ÄúThis
new insight represents an important
contribution to HIV research,‚Äù and
spoke of the discovery as ‚Äúan exciting
model for deriving potential new HIV
therapies.‚Äù
The human immune system is made
up of white blood cells, a large propor-
tion of which are known as T cells.
It is these cells that the HIV virus at-
tacks when it infects the human body.
The researchers interfered with inter-
leukin-2-inducible T cell kinase (also
known as ITK), a signalling protein on
the surface of these cells. The protein
is responsible for the activation of T-
cells, required for the body to mount
an efficient immune response.
Schwartzberg, one of the lead re-
searchers, explained that ‚Äúsuppression
of the ITK protein caused many of the
pathways that HIV uses to be less ac-
tive, thereby inhibiting or slowing HIV
replication.‚Äù
Drugs in the past have targeted pro-
teins present on the virus itself. This is
problematic, as a process called genet-
ic mutation means these proteins can
rapidly alter in composition, allowing
drug-resistant strains to appear. The
human cells, however, have a much
lower mutation rate, thereby making
them an optimal target.
The inactivation of ITK was carried
Novel findings in the fight against HIV
overrule its own instinct, and follow, in
order to stick with a 'friend.' However,
if more fish were present in the group,
the quorum response applied, and
more leaders were necessary to budge
the crowd.
Dr Ward: "Social conformity and the
desire to follow a leader, regardless of
cost, exert extremely powerful influ-
ences on the behaviour of social ani-
mals, from fish to sheep to humans." If
your friend jumped off a cliff, you may
very well not, but if a crowd went run-
ning down a street, wouldn't you?

Scientists target proteins on white blood cells to prevent the HIV virus from mutating into resistant strains
out using a chemical and a genetic in-
hibitor. The T cells were then exposed
to the virus, and its effects were stud-
ied during different stages of the virus‚Äô
replication cycle.
It was not only shown that the virus‚Äô
ability to enter cells was reduced, but
also that interference did not affect
the cell‚Äôs ability to survive, a crucial re-
quirement for any potential therapy.
The study was published earlier this
month in the online edition of the
prestigious U.S. journal; Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences.
