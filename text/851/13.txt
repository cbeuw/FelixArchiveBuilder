Devil Dudes play IC Friday
Tonight sees the re-emergence of the Ents gig!!
Tonight we have two excellent bands on offer by the
names of Ruby Blue and The Devil Dudes.
First on are the Dev/7 Dudes. With a tight backline
and raunchy guitar rifts, they are an excellent
guitar/rock band. The enigmatic vocalist, with his
orgasmic vocals, is someone to be seen to be
believed. A brilliant band, turn up early to get a good
look.
Ruby Blue, after a long and varied career, have had
their ups and downs, but at the moment are most
definitely on an up. They are embarking on a country-
wide tour with Imperial College as one of the first few
dates. Their musical style has been likened to Simple
Minds, U2 and Clannad but Ruby Blue are really just
Ruby Blue.
There is a bar extension until 12 o'clock and a disco
until 2.00am and for £2 (adv), £2.50 (door) or £1
(ents card) you can jump and jive and split your sides
with the Ents team
There are some other events this term: every Friday
in fact. Next week is Jazz Night with HIT, regulars
at Ronnie Scotts will have heard of this band as they
are regulars there. We follow that with two very
special events. Firstly, from Manchester, the Milltown
Brothers, who must be good because they are from
Manchester and the final event of term-The Ents
Christmas Party—with Energy Orchard back by
popular demand. Details later, keep your eyes peeled
and ear to the ground.
