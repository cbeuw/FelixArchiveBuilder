A Term of Success?
IC Sports Clubs start the se-
cond term with, on the whole, a
successful term behind them. By
the end of this term an abun-
dance of silver beverage con-
tainers, it is hoped, will be in
possession of I.C..
The hockey, rugby and soccer
clubs are still going strong in their
respective challenge competitions,
all with good prospects of suc-
cess. Clubs such as squash, judo,
cross-country and rowing are as
usual holding more than their own
and have collected honours al-
ready in the case of the latter two.
The threat of another 1962
winter crippling outdoor sports is
behind us, which is more than
heartening, especially to the peo-
ple who put a lot of time and ef-
fort into sports clubs' organisation
and we all hope that this term
rounds off another successful and
distinguished year to IC's winter
sports cjpffs:
Table Tennis
Club
Report
The Table tennis club has been
auietly succeeding so far this year.
With almost half the season's
fixtures completed in the UL
league, only 5 of the 30 matches
played by IC's five teams have
been lost. The best performan-
ces have come from the second
and third teams, both playing in
Division 3. The second team is
as yet unbeaten and the thirds
have lost once and not surpris-
ingly to the second team. The
firsts, whose performance in com-
parison to their juniors has been
uninspiring, are the only team to
have lost two matches.

In the KO competition tor the
Caribbean Cup, iC's three teams
found themselves in the same
quarter of the draw. The second
team scored a surprising victory
over the US first team and now
play ourfirstteam for a place in
the semi-final
Rugby
Hopes
It has been rather an anxious
term so far. Like everyone else
we suffered at the hand of the
weather earlier on, limiting us to
snow-bound training in Hyde
Park. Two other setbacks were
the injuries sustained by John
Ballard and Barry Sullivan, both
needing shouldtr operations, put-
ting them out f the "t of the
season.
We have been working hard to
overcome all ,uis and today sees
our second round match in the
Gutteridae Cup agaih»t Wye Col-
lege at Wye. If anv
">ne want*' *
o
come along and an :
port there arc jt ^taces in t,
coach leaving fro:^ the Unit,
arch at 11 a.m. This is bound to
be a hard match against a farm-
ing college after a long uoach
journey. However the IC spirit
and the team's undoubted ability
should carry us through.
Apart from the immediate
future we now have organised a
visit to Belgium at Easter where
we play amongst other teams the
Belgium national side and Brus-
sels University.
However, before this exciting
prospect we must get down to the
hard business of winning the
Gutteridge Cup.

Hockey
Although it s...:ied very well
the, 1st XI did not have an in-
spiringfirstterm. Except for one
or two lapses the defence has
played steadily, conceding con-
siderably fewer goals than in the
last few years. However this has
been more than offset by a com-
plete inability to score goals. In
fact, leaving out the 10-1 defeat
of Westfieki, only eight goals
were scored in twelve games. Out
of these only one was won and
six were drawn. The problem
seems to be one of lack of ability
to make good constructive move-
ments midfield. On the brighter
side the other XI's have been very
successful, with the standard of
individual play much higher than
usual. The 2nd XI in particular
is ha1
ing a good year, very well
captained by Nieel Varian.
S o c c e r
Southampton University 3, IC 3
IC'sfirstmatch of this term en-
tailed a long trip down to
Southampton where there had
been no snow. After having
beaten Southampton University
3—2 last term in London, I.C.
were fairly confident of a second
win but as it turned out, they did
not quite succeed.
The conditions were not very
good, the ground being very hard
and a little icy, I.C. adjusted their
game to the slippery surface al-
most immediately, realising that
turning quickly with the ball was
impossible and that first-time
passing was the only answer. This
brought two early goals to I.C.,
scored by Hopweod and Cold-
well, before Southampton had
got into their stride.
After these early goals, the I.C.
onslaught quietened down som-
what and Southampton drew a
goal back but only for Whittle to
score a third goal for I.C.
In the second half the picture
was a little different with South-
ampton doing most of the attack-
ing and I.C. only looking danger-
ous in occasional break-aways.
However the I.C. defence seemed
quite capable of handling the
Southampton attack until the last
10 minutes when they scored two
goals to equalise.

first time ever
Quarter Final Report
Last Wednesday ICWA at-
tempted for the third time to get
into the semi-final of the ULU
cup. After having drawn against
Goldsmith's twice we were deter-
mined -to win.
From the first bully ICWA was
on the attack and scored three
goals in thefirsthalf. In fact the
ball entered the net four times but
one was above the goalkeeper's
head and the Goldsmith's referee
would not allow it. ICWA also
scored another three goals in the
second half, possibly due to the
fact that we floored their goal-
keeper! On one of their few raids
they tried to retaliate with a head
high shot at our goalkeeper but
unfortunately for them one of
their own players got in the way.
SofinallyICWA won by 6 goals
to nil. Much thanks to our voci-
ferous supporters (two in all).

Listen with I.C.W.A
Are you lying comfortably ?—then it'll begin.
" Now old King Gus, created a fuss,
And a merry old fuss made he;
He called for his stout,
And he called for the Presidents three.
And he called for his ale,
And he called for the Presidents three.
Now each of these Presidents had a veryfinepot,
And a very fine pot had he;
It dwelt in its niche,
In the Union Creche,
And was used most frequently.
And in Imperial there were some girls,
And very fine girls were they ;
But " Stay where you are
Outside the bar,"
Thus did the Presidents say.
Said Auntie Jane with great disdain,
' Drunkards not are we.
We don't care
What goes on in there,
You can keep your nursery.'
