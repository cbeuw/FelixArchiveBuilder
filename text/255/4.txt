FELIX
CEDITOR'S
o m m e n t
The time has come for a showdown. This time they have gone
too far. First it was the vote, then it was equal pay, then the Unions
of Oxford and Cambridge crumpled (no, were crushed), so that not
even their Presidencies remained intact, and now the L...t straw. Yes,
women in the Union Bar, with the blessing of the du* •
• officer and
the encouragement of the barman. Gentlemen of IC, man the barri-
cades, we must not let them pass the hallowed portals again.
You may say, " What does it matter if you let them in the Union
Bar, there's never any men in there anyway ?" but the bar is only
the thin end of the wedge, in fact, worse, I suspect it is a red herring
to distract us from the impending coup, by these calculating females,
of the whole Union. My spies tell me the next move will be a take-
over the men's lavatories, a cunning ploy to undermine the economy
Of the Union by wasting Martin Lack's Letraset worth £1 17s. 6d.,
which he bought to tell people where the ladies' is.
Is this not enough ? Do you want to see the President of ICWA
ex-officio President of the Union ? Not only must we defend what
we have we must launch a counter-offensive. See you in the ICWA
lounge on Sunday.
Students are poor. How do I know ? People tell me so. The
impending review of grants does not look as though we will get nuKih
more, and with the cost of living getting exponentially higher it looks
as though we shall be poorer. One way to make your money go
further is to shop where they give student discounts. However, at the
moment it is a matter of luck when you go into a shop whether they
will give you anything off. In order to make the getting of discount
more efficient I would like to compile a list of establishments which
will give them. So next time you buy something (or eat or go to the
theatre) ask if they will give you anything off against your IC or ULU
card (for those in RCS who have yet to receive a ULU card . . .) and
if they say yes let me know, c/o the FELIX ra^k in the Union. A
list will be published later in the term and bop fully used in future
editions of the Union Handbook.

CARNIVAL DETAILS
The Leukaemia Research

of Its Income on research towards

training staff to treat tksm A
paid staff of one, advertising and

minor portion. As (he funds
annual Income is only around
£4,000 the IC carnival should
cause a stir by more than doub-
ling It.
The carnival fund stands at just
less than £2000 which compares
favourably with last year. Basi-
cally this is made up of £2000 of
street collections, £300 of "pools"
subs, various minor donations
like the Mines him show and
minus £500 expenses. There will
be a few more collections this
term but " pools " and " raffles "
will take precedence, The raffle
expects to make over £1000 and
the expensive prizes will be well

worth having. You will of course
be expected to participate whole-
heartedly in the scheme by both
buying and selling. The Royal
Albert Hall Concert just has to be
a success but at the moment " the
all star bill" has not been ar-
ranged.
The fete is the only summer
term event but this will be a tre-
mendous improvement on last
year wuh much interesting equip-
ment from Barnum's, our Carni-
val Suppliers, and perhaps a
simulated parachute descent by
the Parachute Regiment. This
fete should reduce the families of
the Kensington-Chelsea area to
poverty by hook or by crook but
we still need more hook type
ideas.
The whole charity will be
wound up at thefinaldance in the
Union the evening of the fete with
Eric Burdon and the Animals
which whilst not an enormous
money maker should provide a
successful conclusion to the
activities.

Anyone who c«. ..plains trw
no big name groups come to IC
will be disappointed to hear that
Zoot Money played to a half-
filled Concert Hall or: the first
Saturday of term. The actual
numbers there will never be
known because of Ents. bungle
over pickets, but the number was
certainly no more than for a nor-
mal hop. Even members of
Eats. admit that it was not a
good dance, but hasten to add
that the show was good. Zoot
Money's act was described as
"entrancing" and "entertain-
ing," The light show was good
but no doubt an IC electrician
could have done an equally pro-
fessional job. Musically the show
produced a good integrated
sound, but was not particularly
outstanding. Obviously the
whole effect was lessened because
of the small numbers. The
blame for this must fall on the
lack of publicity, which seems to
be due to the poster designer's
many other activities.
While it is not certain that the
Plastic Fairytale has had its last
wag, it seems that only pressure
from the Council will get it going
this term. No sympathy can be
extended to those who have paid
their membership, as while there
were almost 130 members, less
than 75 people arrived to the last
Fairytale of last term. Such an
attendance is very unrewarding
for the members of Ents, who put
in such a lot of effort in an at-
tempt to make it a success. The
lemand was just not there and
hat is the end of it.
Ents. generally seems to be a
little unsettled, with clashes be-
tween Chairman, Keith Guy, and
his main officers. Their main
complaint is that he does not
heed their wishes and organises
things without consulting them.
This he strongly denies, and to
prove his point allowed himself to
be outvoted over a motion he
wanted to lay before Council in
which an Entertainments Club
Committee would be set up to co-
ordinate Ents., Dramsoc. and
other entertainment societies. It
was, however, suggested that
there should be an informal com-
mittee set up to avoid clashes of
these clubs.
Plastic effort
redirected
We can look forward to
brighter hops (or dances as they
are now being called), as all the
effort that went into the Plastic.
Fairytale can now be redirected.
On Saturday the dance will fea-
ture the Marmalade, and a light
and film show is being organised
in co-operation with Dramsoc.
The present scene may be chang-
ing, but IC Ents aim to keep up
with it,

FOR ICSASAF
"£80 derisory"
IC.SASAF was originally set up to raise some £2,000. Thirteen
months later it has so tar collected £80. The original intention of
ICSASAF—or to give it its full title, " The Imperial College South
African Appeal Fund "—was to raiaa money to enab!e a coloured
South African student ta take a three-year course at IC. This fund
was overwhelmingly approved by one of the few quorate Union meet-
ings within living memory, and two organisers were appointed, Andy
Jordan, now a prominent member of Council, and Mike Bell
chambers. The high ideals of that Union meeting seem to have
fallen rather flat—so what went wrong ?
As planned, last summer term ICSASAF sent out 3,600 letters
to Union members in which it appealed for donations. The response
was a steady trickle, rather than a flood, of letters, bringing in the
total of £80. No other means of raising money have yet been tried
beyond an unsuccesful attempt to adopt ICSASAF as this year's Car-
nival charity. " The amount collected reflects poorly on the
organisers; it's a derisory sum," said Andy Jordan. He also agreed
that the original idea had been idealistic to awaken much response
in a Union to 8 8

He added, " we expected
more." It was calculated at the
historic union meeting which be-
gat ICSASAF, that if every union
member contributed 10/-, the re-
quired £2,000 would be quickly
raised. Few eyebrows were raised
at this statement, and a somewhat
smug union joyously and over-
whelmingly accepted its implica-
tions and approved ICSASAF.
In retrospect it seems surprising,
even more so when one considers
that I.C.'s fund-raising instincts
were already directed towards the
Carnival charity. The next time
I.C.U. gets a chance to pass a
motion it should perhaps consider
its issues more deeply. It is also
surprising that a lot more has not
been done to raise money for-
ICSASAF.
For the present two steps are
going to be made to all members
of l.C. staff, and second, ap-
proaches to firms connected with
I.C. are planned. It seems hardly
likely at the moment that any-
thing approaching £2,000 will be
raised by these means. Assum-
ing this, some decision should be
taken soon as to the destination
of the money already donated,
and which is slowly gathering in-
terest in the bank. Whatever
happens, the organisers are deter-
mined it should go towards bring-
ing a coloured student to Britain.
Might it go to a parallel scheme
such as LSESASAF or another,
UCSASAF? This is possible,
but could raise legal complica-
tions. Might the fund be taken
over by a keen union member,
prepared to devote a lot of time
and effort towards raising as
much as possible ? If someone
with a good business sense is pre-
pared to do the job, Andy Jordan
would be very willing to let it go.
The final decision rests with the
Union, one hopes it will consider
carefully the issues it so lightly
brought into being last year.
If ICSASAF is given a fresh
lease of life as I feel it should be,
it should be put on a firmer basis,
with a much larger group of
people working for it—if this is
possible. Two organisers, already
somewhat involved in union acti-
vities, are not enough. It should
attempt to raise money in as
many ways as possible, not
simply by duplicated letters of
appeal. For instance, it could
run a hop and (taking, the long-
term view) print Christmas cards,
it could organise more person-to-
person collections. (It should in-
cidentally publicise its aims more
fully. One I.C. student com-
mented on ICSASAF, "Oh, it's
about aeroplanes, isn't it ?") It
should be more forthright in rat-
tling tins. ICSASAF is scared of
competing with Carnival—but if
it is to raise its £2,000 it must, to
an extent. It is, after all, a union-
backed fund. What it needs are
large quantities of enthusiasm,
hard work, and ideas. If these
quantities are not forthcoming the
money collected so far should go
as quickly as possible to a paral-
lel fund.
(For all those who want to re-
suscitate ICSASAF, the person to
see is Andy Jordan, Chemical
Engineering 3, or Mike Bell-
chambers Weeks 64, Mechanical
Engineering 2).
