HUMAN RIGHTS
YEAR
Is it relevant to IC?
On December 10th, 1948, the
General Assembly of the United
Nations adopted and proclaimed
the universal Declaration of
Human Rights. The declaration
sets out in thirty articles the
rights to which all human beings
are entitled and also states that
together with rights go responsi-
bility. Twenty years later, this
document, although of funda-
mental significance, is virtually
unknown to the general public
and at government level, action
directed at realisation of these
rights is slow to take place. Thus
the General Assembly of the
U.N. designated 1968, Interna-
tional Year of Human Rights.
All countries have been asked to
undertake special programmes of
education and action for Huraan
Rights Year. The main aims of
the U.K. Committee for Human
Rights Year are those of educat-
ing people about human rights
and drawing attention to the lack
of them in certain aspects of life
in this country.
Britain
Perhaps you are wondering
why we in Britain should concern
ourselves with human rights?
Unless you fail to get a job be-
cause of your sex or colour, or
you are illegitimate, or you live
in a slum area, you will probably
think that there is no violation of
human rights in Britain. Yet the
Declaration states that everyone
is entitled to the rights therein
without distinction of any kind
such as race, colour, sex etc. An-
other states that everyone is en-
titled to a decent standard of
living. Even in Britain, in 1968,
there is a great deal to be done in
the field of human rights.
Overseas
What is the situation in the rest
of the world with regard to hu-
man rights? It is not generally
realised that some people are still
held in slavery at present time.
Certainly, the majority of the
world's people do not have an
adequate standard of living and
for many, the rights to education
and to political and religious free-
doms are meaningless. Even if we
in Britain never suffered any in-
fringement of our human rights,
as laid down in the Declaration,
there would still be cause for
concern. For with the realisation
of our rights, goes the responsi-
bility to those who are still de-
prived. At a time when Britain is
facing an economic crisis, it may
seem inappropriate to be con-
cerned with the plight of the rest
of the world. It should be re-
membered, however, that during
the squeeze and freeze and even
since devaluation the majority of
people in this country have been
enjoying a better standard of liv-
ing and more freedoms and pleas-
ures than most other people in
the world.
Thus it is that Human F'<?hts
Year exists and is not without
supporters at IC. All the social
clubs have expressed interest in a
campaign at college and the ma-
jority have been active in forming
an HRY committee and banning
its programme. Tho ...mpaign
was inaugurated at the end of last
term. We hope that during this
term it will gather momentum,
culminating in a HRY exhibition
in March. Some of the Social
Clubs have included meetings
with special relevance to HRY in
their programmes and all the
member clubs of the committee
will be participating in a Teach-
in on Human Rights on February
the first. Eminent speakers will
be defending the concept of hu-
man rights in Islam, Judaism,
Marxism and Apartheid.
In addition to publicising the
lack of human rights in many
areas of the world (including
Britain) the committee hopes to
raise money for organisations that
are committed to helping those
whose rights are being violated.
Donations
Already, the Chinese Society has
offered the profits from its New
Year celebrations to the commit-
tee. Another most encouraging
offer has come unsolicited from
a mines undergraduate. He and
his family are giving a sum of
money to HRY charities instead
of spending it on Christmas and
Birthday presents for'one another.
The committee would be delighted
to hear of similar offers from
other IC students. We are also
supporting the renewed efforts of
the ICSASAF organisers.
Prospects
Here, I have merely outlined
what is behind the HRY cam-
paign and the possibilities for
actionâ€”its success as always de-
pends on general student partici-
pation. If, as the editor suggested
in the last issue, students are not
intrinsically apathetic, then per-
haps we can hope for a successful
campaign. But, you may say, he
also mentioned the need to offer
something that is relevant to the
average student. Is Human Rights
Year relevant?
Student
Involvement
We believe it is, because
whether we like it or not, having
a university education makes us a
privileged class. We will prob-
ably not suffer many violations of
our rights, though neither may we
boast of winning the battle for
them. Ours could be the role of
helping others realise their hu-
man rights and 1968 at IC is the
time and place to begin.
Please send suggestions or
offers of assistance to the secre-
tary HRY committee via the
Union Rack.

WELLS S O C
Wells Soc.'s first meeting this
term was packed out to hear Dr.
J. H. Humphrey, F.R.S., speak
on "Biological Warfare" or
" Public Health in Reverse " as it
has been described. Two years
ago a speaker from Porton Down
was banned from speaking at the
last minute as he held " classified
information," but this term's
speaker suffered from no such
handicap.
Problems
Those wlio turned up at the
meeting hoping for lurid accounts
of "the Doomsday Bug" and
germ gums a la Molesworth must
have been disappointed. Dr.
Humphrey did not see biological
warfare in its present state of de-
velopment as a terrifying threat
to mankind. Many problems have
to be overcome before microbes
can be used effectively as wea-
pons, including those of spread-
ing the organisms. Obviously
such things as mosquitos, sand-
flies or fleas cannot be used as
these cannot be trained to bite the
right man.
Research
Perhaps the greatest problem is
to estimate beforehand the effect
of a biological attack. Experi-
ments are done on animals but
there is no way of extrapolating
the result to people, although ap-
parently there are some who
volunteer to be experimented on.
According to the speaker when-
ever there is an accidental infec-
tion in one of the research estab-
lishments it is of great importance
to scientific research.
Legality
If all the problems could be
overcome, biological warfare
would have some great advan-
tages, like its great potency and
ability to kill without destroying
property. On the legal aspect the
UN has prohibited the first use of
" poisonous and obnoxious sub-
stances" and germ warfare. How-
ever, there is no restriction on
possession of biological weapons
and their use in retaliation. In Dr.
Humphrey's opinion, biological
warfare was more likely to be
prevented by the sheer number of
problems involved in using it.

HUM PHS TRUMPET
I find it difficult to write an
article on the current set of lec-
tures by Humphrey Lyttleton.
This is not because the lectures are
in any way poor, indeed they are
extremely entertaining but he
confines himself to description
and stops short of expressing any
sort of opinion on the iazz scene
in general, or in particular for
that matter. It is like writing an
article on yesterday's Maths lec-
ture.
It was something of a revela-
tion, therefore to hear him talking
over lunch before his second lec-
ture. He was remarking that it
was necessary to have reached a
certain level of technical prowess
on an instrument before one
could experiment legitimately. I
asked him if he thought that the
avant-garde players today had
this prowess and he agreed that
most of them had.
He also remarked that modern
jazz was tending to reach back
into jazz traditions and re-emerge
in a new form (reminiscent of the
Hegel's dialectic materialism)
John Coltrane, he said, was just at
the breakthrough point when he
died, and Archie Shepp and
Rollins are almost at that point
now.
I find this an exciting concept,
certainly the avant-garde has
come in for a lot of emotional
rather than rational criticism and
to a certain extent this is under-
standable. One would be most
upset and annoyed if a lecturer
spent an hour or more in front of
his audience setting up a demon-
stration, and this is on fact what
modern jazz musicians are doing.
They are trying to find their feet
and build a solid platform.
How does one conclude an
article of this soft? Unfortunately
I cannot pick up my own trumpet
and blow it like Humph, so I
can only recommend that you go
to his lectures.

BARROW
With the advent of a new term,
the General iStudies Committee
broke away from the set pattern
of formal lectures and question-
and-answer sessions by inviting
the Barrow Poets to perform at
college. The group enlivened the
normally overlong Tuesday lunch
hours of the first two weeks with
their refreshing approach to litera-
ture and music where the parody,
the oriental and the just plain off-
beat seem to merge to produce
entertainment of thefirstorder.
Their second performance, to
POETS
a packed Union Lower Lounge,
was especially characterized by
its easygoing informality. The
blend of the violin with a home-
made double-bass-cum-cymbals-
cum-drum contraption and a
woodwind instrument with a
modified tin funnel lent a refined
idiocy to their songs and their
choice of poetry was calculated
to send a student audience into
raptures, which it did. It must not
be long before the Barrow Poets
are invited to return
PAUL HEATH
The Barrow Poets' most popular item in their Lower Lounge
MBion was this poem by Roger McGough, reprinted by kind per-
mission of Penguin Books and the poet
At Lunchtime-A Story of Love
When the busstopped to avoid
damaging a mother and child in the road, the
younglady in the greenhat sitting opposite
was thrown across me, and not being one to
miss an opportunity i started to makelove
with all my body.
At first she resisted saying that it
was too early in the morning and toosoon
after breakfast and that anyway she found
me repulsive. But when i explained that
this being a nuclearage, the world was going
to end at lunchtime, she took off her
greenhat, put her busticket in her pocket
and joined the exercise.
The buspeople, and therewere many of
them, were shockedandsurprised and amused-
andannoyed, but when the word got around
that the world was coming to an end at lunch-
time, they put their pridein their pockets
with their bmstickets and madeloveone with
the other. And even the busconducter, being
over, climbed into the cab and struck up
some sort of relationship with the driver.
Thatnight, on the bus coming home,
wewere all a little embarrassed, especially me
and the younglady in the greenhat, and we
all started to say in different ways howhasty
and foolish we had been. Butthen, always
having been abitofalad, i stood up and
said it was a pity that the world didn't nearly
end every lunchtime and that we could always
pretend. And then it happened . . .
Quick asa crash we all changed partners
and soon the bus was aquiver with white
mothballbodies doing naughty things.
And the next day
And everyday
In everybus
In everystreet
In everytown
In everycountry
people pretended that the world was coming
to an end at lunchtime. It still hasn't.
Although ina way it has.
