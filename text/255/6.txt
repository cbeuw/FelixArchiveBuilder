CARADON
Answering pointed questions
that at times seemed to be per-
sonal attacks, Lord Caradon,
British Permanent Representative
at the United Nations, main-
tained the air of unharassed dig-
nity that is expected in so experi-
enced a statesman.
Mr. Kenneth Younger (a most
able Chairman for the meeting)
and Dr. Rossalyn Higgins, both
of whom have wide experience of
the U.N., were the other " speak-
ers " of last Wednesday's meet-
ing. In the form of a question
forum, it was organised by the
London colleges in the U.N. stu-
dent assembly and the I.R.C.
who, in conjunction with the IC
nationalistic societies, run the IC
branch of the U.N.S.A., acted as
hosts.
B R
BEST
Mr. G. F. G. Twistleton-Wyke-
ham-Fiennes, formerly chairman
of the Eastern Railways Board
and General Manager of the
Eastern Region of British Rail
had "much to say" at his General
Studies Talk on the first Thursday
of term.
Bad freight
Not surprisingly, his talk was
concerned with the history of
British Rail and a survey of the
developments in the post-war
years of the rail system. He
claimed that Britain led the world
in rail passenger transport be-
cause even though other countries
were individually more punctual,
faster, more frequent or more
economic in their services, when
all these factors and several more
were taken into account, we were
undoubtedly in the forefront.
Unfortunately the same was not
true of freight traffic as a compre-
hensive policy for freight had
never been formulated, unlike for
passenger transport where things
had been very carefully planned.
Government
slammed
Mr. Fiennes also slammed suc-
cessive governments for not al-
lowing the Minister of Transport
into the Cabinet until the mid
1950's when transport accounted
for nearly a quarter of our Gross
National Product. He also criti-
cised the policy of never appoint-
ing a minister with previous ex-
perience of transport.
ATTACKED
Nothing wrong
with UN
" There is nothing wrong with
the U.N., just its members," was
one of the provocative remarks
made by Lord Caradon during his
very short introduction. Given to
stimulate questions, unnecessarily
as it happened, it included a de-
finition of the U.N. as a forum
for discussion where all notions
may be heard equally (at the
General Assembly), a place where
representatives of all nations can
easily contact each other (espec-
ially where no formal diplomatic
relations exist), a machine for
helping the world's problems (its
various agencies, e.g.. World
Health Organisation) and an in-
strument for peace (via the Se-
curity Council).
Great powers
Questions on reform ranged
from the promise to the U.N. of
the necessary " teeth " to enforce
its ruling to the question of
whether it was right for the
" Great Powers " to have special
privileges in the Security Council.
All speakers seemed to agree that
while in theory all nations should
have the same say, in practice,
those who would have to pay for
or otherwise implement would
naturally have a veto by uni-
lateral action anyway and hence
the practical impossibility of
equlity of nations in this sphere.
M a n y Africans
With the large proportion of
African students present it was
inevitable that Rhodesia would be
much discussed. This was indeed
the case though nothing emerged
in addition to the newspaper re-
ports over the past twenty-seven
months. Eventually the chair
caiied a halt to the Rhodesia dis-
cussion to allow other topics to be
brought in.
These included Cyprus, the
Arab-Israeli war and its after-
math and the position of the U.N.
and the Chinese Peoples Repub-
lic. This last was perhaps par-
ticularly enlightening as the three
possible alternatives are : to con-
tinue as at present with Nation-
alist China, to exchange Nation-
alist for Communist, or to have
both.
The U.N. charter, which neces-
sitates the winning of general sup-
port by major powers for their
schemes, also allows its members
to decide which choice they want.
The problem is not then the
U.N., but the members of the
U.N.

Spencer's Washboard Kings
gave their performance last Wed-
nesday at the Jazz Club' Stomp.
Surprisingly few people turned
up to see them however, although
in the latter half we were hon-
oured by the presence of some
sediment from the Union Bar.
IC First
The I.C. (Footstomping) Origi-
nal New Orleans Dixiland Jazz
Band opened the show with a
competent display of musician-
ship but Spencers Washboard
Kings, when their turn came,
captured the audience immedi-
ately; and before a single couple
began to stomp. Their second
stint provided not only musical
entertainment but a certain degree
of good spontaneous humour, the
mark of a professional group.
Audience participation and solo
breaks, including a magnificent
washboard display added more
variety to the performance and I
think I can say, unchallenged,
that a very good time was had by
all.
