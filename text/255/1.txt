The four ICU reps on the
General Studies Committee—Ian
Wells, Babs Hedge, Jane Pearson
and Pete Ruhemann—are asking
for ideas for the 1968-9 General
Studies and Touchstone program-
mes. Lecture series are already
planned on political minorities,
the Second World War and
psychology, but further sugges-
tion would be welcomed.

Members of the College are
reminded that today is the last
day the Mass X-ray unit is visit-
ing the College. Although today
is meant mainly for staff, students
who have not yet attended are
urged to go to the unit which is
situated outside Weeks Hall. The
ground floor Common Room of
Weeks is serving as a reception
area. Since one active case of
Tuberculosis has been reported in
a first year student, it is clearly
important that as many people as
possible should take this oppor-
tunity.
IC may share
nursery
with R C A
A children's nursery is in oper-
ation at RCA, which has about
ten spare places. These could be
used by the children of students
at IC for about £1 a week. At
the moment the hours are from
10 a.m. until 4 p.m., but it is
hoped that these can be extended,
if sufficient demand exists. Any-
one interested should get in touch
with Rex Lowin, Physics PG as
soon as possible.

the great foe of Southside last
Thursday lunchtime. Fa!! story
in Late News.
The three Presidents of the con-
stituent colleges have met and
come to an arrangement which
will hopefully allow Morphy day
to continue.
The idea basically is to try to
keep better control of the forces
until they have arrived at Putney
towpath when, as usual, all hell
will be let loose. FELIX wishes
them luck with their Herculean
task.

Little Fred found a sliell

It was an unexploded one
And Fred's no longer here.
Men Only?
On Saturday, 14th January,
four thirsty Icwarians made a
bee-line for their own bar in the
lower lounge. They found the
lounge bestrewn with stunned
males prostrated in the chairs
softly murmuring to themselves
" There's women in the Union
Bar . . . There's women in the
Union Bar. . . ."
On attracting the barman's at-
tention they were told bluntly that
service was only available in the
Union Bar. Thus, driven by the
need for refreshment, they filed
into the Union Bar in trepida-
tion. Having obtained their
drinks they retired to an incon-
spicuous corner and were totally
ignored by all for the rest of the
evening.
They were driven to it by thirst

A statement from the Secre-
tary of the College, Mr. M. J.
Davies.
Parking meters began to operate from January 15th in Exhibi-
tion Road and Prince Consort Road and in other roads near the
College lying within the boundaries of the Westminster City Council;
and it is expected that meters in the other public roads near the Col-
lege, lying within the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, will be
operating by about June.
The College will have parking space for about 400 cars within its
precincts but this number is barely one half of the number of cars
belonging to College people and at present normally parked during
the day-time in and around the College. A division of the available
places between teaching and other staff, and students,' has been
made, and Heads of Departments have allocated the places given to
their Department, taking account of need and on the basis that
teaching staff and other staff should have equal numbers. The
Imperial College Union has allocated the student share of the places.
The Parking and Traffic Commitee has been reconstituted, under
the chairmanship of Mr. A. Stephenson, with representatives from the
I.C. Union, The Association of University Teachers, the Trade Unions
and the Administration, and Professor Buchanan has kindly agreed to
join the Committee. The Committee has the power to consult any
person within the Collese, for help or advice, as and when required.
The Committee will keep under constant review the problems of
traffic and parking and the method of allocating parking places; and
will advise the Rector.
Representatives of the Trade Unions met the Rector just before
Christmas and discussed with him several of the problems arising
from the shortage of parking accommodation as it affected their
members. In particular, they said that in their opinion it would be
possible to manage the parking arrangements without involving the
College in additional expense. The Rector agreed that there should
be a trial period when no charge should be made to anybody allocated
a parking sticker but said that if experience proved that the College
could not control the parking without spending additional money,
charges would have to be made. The Trade Union representatives
agreed to this.
The College parking problems will not reach their peak until
the College assembles for the new Session in October, by which time
all of the public roads around the College will have parking meters
in operation. The Parking and Traffic Committee will therefore have
time to see how the scheme is working and will have some factual
evidence on which to base their recommendations. In the meantime,
the College is considering if there are any possibilities of increasing
the parking space within the College precincts.
ED.: Reaction to the news on
parking charges has been favour-
able from all quarters. All now
seems quiet between the empty
wastes of Exhibition Road and
Prince Consort Road and the
crowded meterless Queens Gate.

Patrick Haxell of the Chemis-
try Department has been com-
missioned to find out the extent
of bicycle stealing in RCS. He
says that he is willing to do this
for the other Colleges too, so any-
one who has had a bicycle stolen
this session should contact him
via the Chemistry Rack or Tizard
Hall.
