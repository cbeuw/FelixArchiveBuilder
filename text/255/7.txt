The leaders of
Teaching
Week
Jonathon Young is a new kind
of monk. He is contemporary in
his thinking and actions. A
deeply committed Christian, he
wears his beliefs lightly.
Bob Nind is our speaker at the
evening sessions. He has spent
many years in the West Indies—
loves music, and hopes to use
some folksinging in his talks. A
speaker of discernment and fine
turn of phrase, he is young,
friendly and intelligent. He will
bring with him as his team a host
of helpers. They will include a
journalist, a headmaster, some
clergy, teachers, electrical en-
gineers, etc. He will also be
helped by a large team of stu-
dents. They will be among us
during the week and some 200 of
us are acting as hosts to them, in
providing meals, coffee parties,
etc., maybe YOU have already
very kindly consented to be a
host. If you have, then please
bring along your friends—be-
lievers, don't knows, etc. — and
see that they meet your guest
over coffee during this great
week.
WHAT and WHY
Your rather slick fifth form
science master might have given
you the impression that intelligent
SCIENCE students do not waste
their time and trouble over God
and matters of faith. Some of
you might still be suffering from
this delusion. A TEACHING
WEEK is exactly what it says. It
is an opportunity to present in-
telligently, dynamically and with
strong conviction Hie essential
truths—called the Gospel—held
by Christian men and women.
The Gospel is concerned about
this world, this earth, this age of
technology, this college of sci-
ence.. It is not merely the very
devout and the very pious. It is
not the hobby of the inadequate
and stiitified person, who has
nothing better to do with his
spare time. It is rather the dyna-
mic, the pulsating, quickening
and life generating heartbeat of
the young, intelligent man or
woman who wants to live life and
live it fully.
The Gospel has more to do
with Biology than Bach, more
with technology than trumpets.
WHEN and WHERE
The Teaching Week is from
February 4th — February 11th.
This is after the half-sessionals!
There will be three informal
evening talks in the Lower Re-
fectory, Southside, on Monday,
February 5th, Tuesday, February
6th, and Wednesday February
7th. The theme will be " Jesus—
today, yesterday and forever."
These will be given by Jonathon
Young, a contemporary " with
it" monk.
Sinclair Goodlad will be giving
us a " Face to Face "» with Lord
Beaumont of Whitely—the chair-
man of the Executive Council of
Great Britain of the Liberal
Party, a distinguished speaker on
Human Rights and Drugs—their
use and disuse.
On Thursday, February 8th, at
6.15 p.m., a scripture service for
all Christians—Roman Catholics,
Methodists, Baptists, Anglicans,
etc., will take place in Holy
Trinity, Prince Consort Road,
Prof. Geoff Goodwin of LSE will
be the preacher.

Briscoe on Student Attitudes
Student attitudes and behaviour
continue to command space in
the national Press, and student
politicians, educationalists and
" Felix" alike seem to have a
great deal to say about " Student
Apathy," high incidenceof neuro-
sis in Universities, lack of ambi-
tion and job-orientation amongst
students, the restructuring of
higher education and myriad al-
lied subjects.
Most of these worthy people
pride themselves On their objec-
tive approach to these matters;
they trytoremain totally detached
as they watch students, send out
questionnaires, and unearth sta-
tistics on anything from the length
of student hair to the number of
postgraduates who become Yogis.
Could not the subjective views of
students themselves, and their
ideas about why they are as they
are have some value?
It is hoped to form, in IC, a
group of people who are inte-
rested in student group behaviour
and their own attitudes to their
education and environment. So
if you've got ideas about what's
right or wrong with your educa-
tion, if you feel apathetic about
the prospect of getting a degree,
if you think that the " Hippy "
philosophy should be taught in
IC, or if you just want to shoot
down other people's ideas with
ammunition from your own ex-
perience please put a note in the
internal mail with your name and
department on it to me, Electrical
Engineering 2, or pop up to
Tizard 546 between 1 pm and
2pm on Thursday, 25th January.
