The where, when,how, how much of
I.C. STUDENT HOUSES
at to m l of.
When LInstead Hall is finished this snmmer it will be the last
Han of Residence to be opened for possibly the next ten years.
Nevertheless the accommodation situation in the area of IC win be
improving all the time. This will be done by the development of the
student houses.
The first one of these has been leased by the College at 54-56
Evelyn Gardens and while not all plans have been finalised it seems
as though student houses will be a cross between a Hall of Residence
and a flat. At the end of March plans will go out for tender for the
conversion of the three houses into study bedrooms. The result should
be similar to Garden Hall, but while initially rooms will be for one,
two or three people rearrangement of living space will be possible.
For instance, on the first floor of one of the houses are two single
rooms and one double room, it would be possible and quite permis-
sible to rearrange them into two double rooms and a living room.

Dear Sir,
We wish to point out the one
and only factual error in your
obituary of Roines in FELIX last
week. He is ALIVE and at Sil-
wood Park where he is known to
all his dear and close friends as
Eamonn Furd. In view of this
startling revelation we look for-
ward to future adventures of
Roines and if required will supply
real life details of this character
under plain cover.
Yours faithfully,

Israel has always been a popu-
lar place for students to visit, but
is out of many people's pocket.
The Trustees of the Jerusalem
Educational Trust are offering a
limited number of scholarships
for a four week visit to Israel
starting in mid-August. These are
worth £60 out of a total cost of
£110. Application forms can be
obtained from the Secretary, Jesus
College, Oxford.
am,
I would be grateful if you could
obtain some reasons why the Jazz
club is loosing such a prodigious
amount of money at their Friday
night concerts. At the recent RCC
meeting the meeting was informed
that of the £100 allocated to the
club in order to finance concerts
for the year all this money and
£25 more had been spent on the
four concerts last term i.e. £31
per concert! Permission was
given to transfer something of the
order of £30 from their advertis-
ing grant to help pay for the
concerts. A further £40 was re-
quested and given to finance
future dances.
How is it that every other club
manages to run concerts and
dances at a profit and yet the
Jazz club calmly expects to lose
£30 plus each time? Their ad-
Reply by Steve Mollinson,
Chairman of R.C.C.
The Jazz Club was originally
allocated £15 for subsidising con-
certs, they in fact spent £48 due
to poor attendances, and antici-
pated another £7 for outstanding
items. The other £45 was spent
on advertising, including a bulk
order for posters. They re-
quested £40 to cover their losses
and were granted this. They also
requested up to £40 for another
two dances, thisfigureto include
the advertising for these dances
which were aimed to break even
and sc the ensuing £35 of their
advertising grant would not be
used. Neither myself nor the
Fhe house will have only back-
ground central heating, but there
will be gas or electric fires run
through coin-in-the-slot meters.
Cleaners will come in daily to
dean the common living areas,
but the tidiness of the bedrooms
will be the occupant's responsi-
bility. The house will have
kitchens alongside the common
rooms, but lazy residents will
have to come to the campus if
they want their food made for
them.
The rents will be between
£2 10s. and £3 10s. so the student
houses will be more expensive
than the Halls of Residence from
which they will befinanciallyin-
dependent. The house will be
sea supporting down to the last
detail.
The house will be run by stu-
dents; Dave Harris, secretary of
ICU, will be the first warden.
The conditions of the lease are
fairly restricting so while a student
house will be freer than a Hail
of Residence it will not be as free
as a flat. It is envisaged that about
50 per cent of the residents will
be post-graduates as they will use
the house for a greater part of the
year than an under-graduate and
so enable the rents to be kept at
an acceptable level.
Thisfirststudent house will be
opened around the end of June,
but by then it is hoped that seve-
ral other houses will have been
leased so that by Easter 1969
there may be as many as a thou-
sand places in Hall and student
houses. The success of the
scheme depends entirely on the
residents themselves as it has to
be proved that students are cap-
able of running their own houses.
vertising seems to be badly at
fault, the fact that the advertis-
ing money will now be spent on
hiring groups adds weight to this
argument. Another strange
point is that it is prepared to have
a concert during the vacation. In
reply to the question "won't
everybody be on holiday?" it was
said " Well, people know it's on
and they can come if they want
to." I doubt if people will know
if it's on and the majority of stu-
dents will not be able to attend
anyway.
All this seems a scandelous
waste of money, these concerts
seem to be merely a way for a few
Jazz club members to see the top
groups with union subsidised
tickets. Please, why is this al-
lowed by the RCC?
D. N. SWEETING
(3rd Year Civil)
President of the Jazz Club recall
any suggestion of a concert dur-
ing the vacation, and if it was
suggested permission was not
granted for it to be held.
Although one of the functions
of the Union is to subsidise mi-
nority interests, the type of in-
terest and amount of subsidy be-
ing decided by students, it should
be pointed out that the two
dances were to be held on an ex-
perimental basis, if they first cjid
not break even no more such
functions would be held, as this
would indicate lack of general
student interest, the feeling being
that we should not have to subsi-
dise something like a jazz con-
cert.
Ray Flippant leaned back in
his hide-bound chair and watched
the dark clouds gathering outside.
Flippant always watched from the
other side of the window. He
stretched across and picked up
the black telephone receiver. Its
coldflatnesssmoothed across his
ear and the microphone nestled
comfortingly under his chin.
" Give me"security," he required;
the phone ticked and chattered
sweet nothings. It was the first
satisfaction he had had since the
night before. " J don't want stu-
dents in the union again," he
said, "they don't take things seri-
ously enough," and put down the
phone. He sniggered and
slammed the bell on his desk.
The ping reverberated round the
room and Martin, his faithful
manservant, came through the
chocolate door: it had been
decorated with the C.D.M. when
it had borne the full brunt of an
attack on Dave Harassed. Flip-
pant still ruminated on that other
day when Harassed and he had
stood shoulder to shoulder
against justice. "Get me my
black shirt," as Harassed walked
in: in death, Flippant thought,
Harassed would still be wreathed
in smiles. " The director is on
his way to see you," said
Harassed and forgot to post
another letter. Flippant tossed a
shilling in the air: " I can beat
that by twelve," he said and
vatched the silver disc slide down
the gullet of his coffee urn.
Harassed started, " You're too
quick on the draw with the
wrong thing," but Flippant's
draw had back-fired. Already P.
stood in the room. Flippant put
his personality back in his
pocket. His corduroy jacket
shook with emotion : that was as
near as Flippant appeared to get
to it. P. said " Its no good think-
ing you're God Almighty. Gods

sometime fail. Christ had to walk
on the water but most of us mor-
tals can swim." A stone shat-
tered the window and the cold
wind twisted inside Flippant's
shirt. He no longer had a facade
to protect him from the world
outside: the goose-pimples began
to freeze on his chest. Some-
body started to bang on the office
door. " We must face this to-
gether," Flippant said as another
pane split open. P. did not de-
mur. Harassed bent and picked
up a note on the floor. " It's
an invitation to the President's
Ball," he said: "You'll go?"
"Yes." That was one thing
Harassed would not forget. "We
must have a Council of War," P.
urged. " Impractical," said
Harassed. Flippant looked for
his hockey stick and the balls
which he normally talked to load
it. "The office has been robbed."
he screamed. " All of us here
have been robbed." " . . . Too
•right," chanted the mob outside.
"What do they want?" said
Harassed. " From, wrong to
right!" the crowd chanted again.
Flippant forgot his earlier,
cheaper laughs and turned to P.
" The desk against the door," he
muttered : anything to stop their
progress, he thought. The door
bowed to the clamour outside
and thefloorwas like a Mediter-
ranean beach before they put the
sand down. Flippant remem-
bered afterwards the sharp pain
above his eye as he backed from the
door. The warm blood throbbed
from the stone cut. "Why do
they do this to me ?" he whis-
pered from his daze. " I never
did anything." " . . . Too right,"
the crowd came back. " They're
children," Flippant cried into
P.'s arms. The biggest child's
tears tried to wash away his past.
Because all pantomimes must
end some time.
