Having been back for two and
a half weeks I hope you have all
followed the good example set by
our fourteen stone academic offi-
cer who has tried to lose some
of the extra weight that Christ-
mas left with him. In fact he
hasn't eaten solid food since he
arrived here this term. We're all
very worried about him on stair-
case 2 lizard.
Study Studies
However he informs us that the
Management Studies and Indus-
trial Sociology course has just
been launched. The lectures are
at 4.30 p.m. on a Tuesday in
Mech Eng. The first was held
yesterday. The lecturer is Miss
Woodward and colleagues, and
they may hold tutorials and semi-
nars later. This year the scheme
is experimental and non examin-
able; but if it proves successful it
may be introduced into third
year options later.
In the Maths department the
undergraduate circular has almost
been analysed and the results will
be given to the Senior Tutor with-
in the next week or so.
I would like to remind Physics
and Chemistry students that staff
student committee reports are
posted on notice boards in their
departments.
Commandos
At the meeting of year reps
held last week several interesting
points were brought up.
Mike reminded the reps about
his commando squad of collec-
tors, the idea is for people to give
their names to Mike (via Physics)
and then, say if rush hour trains
are delayed, the squad would
assemble, rush to the station,
mingle with the crowd, without
adding to the headaches of the
station master, and collect lots of
money. This idea is a good way
of increasing our large lead in the
amount of money collected.
Smoking Concert
All those who have been to the
smoking concert in past years will
know all about the mixture of
sketches and free beer that goes
it make it a success. Not to men-
tion the barrel of beer for the best
sketch and a bottle of whiskey for
the best limerick.

Coloured Bras
Don't forget the Union Meeting
tomorrow—There's a report on
Frank's motion and election of
the committee to help with this,
as well as the first reading of the
new constitution which has been
posted in the notice boards for a
week or so.
One point coming from this
which was discussed at the year
rep's meeting last week is the sys-
tem of awards given by the union
and the possibility of giving an
award other than a tie. Maria
Wallis suggested a Social Colours
Bra but Mike would rather see a
pair of panties—maybe he will
have a few examples for us.
Finally. I'd like to tell you all
that Betty thanks Stew Barnes,
who wrote the last Mackmania,
for her mention and give a point
to Andy Jordan—he needs it!

I think everyone in Mines
would like to congratulate our
Ents officer, Stan Greetham, on
his superb organisation of the
Mines Ball, held at the end of
last term. This was thefirsttime
that the event has been held in
Southside and Stan and his com-
mittee worked tremendously hard
at their difficult task with the
result that this year's Mines Ball
will be remembered by all who
attended.
While gratefully acknowledg-
ing all the congratulations which
he has received since the occasion
Stan confessed that he too had
such a good time that he cannot
remember very much about the
later hours. However perhaps it
is worth noting that the dice table
made a loss, for probably the first
time ever, largely due-to the fact
that an RCS underling was call-
ing the wrong odds.
Mines 90 skating
The venue for this term's
Mines Night has been fixed as
Queens Club for ice skating. The
Journey there will be via the
Builders Run, Churoh Street., and
Bayswater Road, with the alter-
native route for the more affluent
being via Knightsbridge, Park
Lane and Bayswater Rd.
In a recent exclusive interview
with that master of the English
language and also Editor of RSM
Journal, Barry Hood, the news
leaked out that a bumper edition
of the Journal can be expected
this year, with lots of articles and
possibly even photographs. How-
evr, perhaps the brightest news is
the possibility that the price will
be slashed by over a half, so that
pople will be induced to read
RSMJ, thus boosting circulation
to what could be an all time re-
cord.
In the first week of this term
Mines held a film show, in aid of
Carnival when twofilms,Gambit
and The Outrage, were shown.
Despite the fact that one of the
films was rather poor, an enter-
taining evening was had by all,
and Carnival profited by the sum
of £17. Another film show will
be held later in the term when the
films should be undoubtedly
spicier since they have been
chosen by Vice-President Phil
Hopwood.
Mines Carnival effort is going
very strongly and since we al-
ready have over £500 collected
there is no reason why this year
we should not exceed our target
of £1,000. Our first term's col-
lections put us far in front of
Guilds and RCS in the amount
raised per capita. For this term's
effort a "Collecting Week" is
planned when it is hoped that
Metallurgy, Geology and Mining
and Min Tech will go out on
different nights, and a prize of a
few crates will be awarded to the
department which collects most
cash.
By now the much publicised
tea and coffee machine should
have arrived and been installed in
level 2, Min. Tech. dept. At pre-
sent it seems that there are no in-
gredients for the machine so all
you thirsty Minesmen may have
to wait a little longer before you
can get a drink out of licensing
hours.
On Sunday 28th there will be
an all star football match at Har-
lington when Mines play Guilds
in the Technology Cup. Since
Guilds have a very strong team
this year it is essential that Mines
have a lot of support so what
better way of getting rid of your
Sunday hangover than standing
on the touchline and spurring the
Mines team to victory.

First things first—a belated
New Year Greeting to all
Guildsmen. (Felix unaccount-
ably failed to appear on New
Year's Day.)
Morphy Day Repeat
At the beginning of a new term,
perhaps it would be useful to
sketch in the major events of
interest to Guildsmen. If last
term was the term of non events
(Morphy Day and the Swimming
Gala) this is the term of enter-
tainments. (Though some have
suggested re-staging Morphy Day
on the Oxford-Cambridge Boat
Race.)
it's a Magical
Mystery Night
Our Entertainments Committee
have already organised the En-
gineers' Dinner and Dance to be
held on Feb. 2nd and all is going
smoothly for a really superb even-
ing for those lucky enough to get
a ticket. Next they have really
let their imagination run riot on
the greatest ever Carnival to be
organised at I.C.—in conjunc-
tion with R.S.M. (Really Stupid
Mugs?) arrangements are well
under way for the Magical
Mystery Night—advance adver-
tising is already starting so be
ready to buy tickets at the first
opportunity.
Following this tremendous
night out we have two " sport"
events: the first Guilds Soc-
cer Sixes at Harlington, and
the annihilation of all opposition
in the Bristol 24 hour Pedal Car
Race by Guilds revolutionary GT
pedalcars.
Music and Culture
In addition this term
we will be having at least a couple
of Guilds Nights—these will be
great fun for all concerned and
details will be released at our
Union Meeting on Thursday at
1.15 pm in Mech Eng 220. This
is perhaps the best Union Meeting
of the year—our contribution to
the General Studies Course—our
most sophisticated and erudite
occasion—the Guilds Festival of
Music and Culture. All years will
be submitting scintillating items
of entertainment in their quest
for the W.C trophy: certain
other alcoholic prizes are also
available. We have not accepted
David Frost's entry this year as
its standard was not sufficiently
high! Make sure your year has
an entry and turn up for a really
great entertainment.
Union Office
Meanwhile the most im-
portant event of the term
so far is that we have com-
pleted the major part of the fur-
nishing of the Guilds Union Office
—it is now the smoothest student
office in any Union anywhere!
This project has taken nearly two
years to complete and during this
time the favourite occupation of
the occupants has been " to count
the number of holes in the wall
today." Everyone in Guilds is
welcome, to drop in at opening
hours about anything at all—
ideas, comments, suggestions—
and we open every lunchtime ex-
cept Wednesdays.
Don't forget: Union Meeting
this Thursday.
VIETNAM
AND THE ABUSE OF SCIENCE
On Thursday, 11th January, Dr. Stephen Rose of the Bio-
chemistry Department, I.C., spoke to the International Relations Club
on Vietnam and the Abuse of Science. The talk was preceded by an
instructive and moving film from N. Vietnam about the war. This
contrasted sharply with the US propaganda put within easy reach of
all of us AND turned out to be irrelevant to Dr. Rose's talk.
Dr. Rose began by alleging that the war in Vietnam was being
waged by the US as a largely experimental war in which many new
chemicals and other weapons were being used for thefirsttime. This,
he said, was immoral, internationally illegal and, in the long run,
extremely dangerous to the world.
Chemical and biological weapons fall into 5 groups all of which
were made illegal in 1925 by the Geneva protocols. The US congress
however refused to ratify them. Dr. Rose stated that the US admitted
to the extensive use of defoliating agents in Vietnam. The claim by
the US defoliaters that "only we can stop forests" does not adequately
portray the power of this weapon. The US's stated aims in using
defoliating agents are to deprive the NLF of cover and starve them of
food by destroying crops. In accordance with the US's usual high
moral standard the " innocent" people of S. Vietnam are bombarded
with leaflets before every defoliating raid. However, since most
peasants cannot read and anyway will not abandon their lives to go to
distant US held areas, they stay in their villages and take the conse-
quences. Crops are destroyed ; women, children and old people die
of malnutrition and the mobile Viet Cong escape easily.
Some of the Herbicidal (defoli-
ating) agents used contain arsenic
compounds and, according to re-
ports, fish, poultry, buffalo and
other animals die first.
Forests Destroyed
Dr. Rose went on to say, the im-
morality of the present effect of
these activities is unquestionable
but the hazards for the future are
also ominous. The upsetting of
the ecological balance resulting
from destruction of forests " half
the size of Montana" will have
grave effects on future generations
of any colour.
Biological Weapons
At present the U.S. chemical
corps spends 400 Million Dollars
per annum. Research is being'
conducted on quite a large scale
by various universities and cor-
porations in the U.S., some of
these organisations are labelled
" food machinery "-doublethink!
Some " workers " at Fort Deit-
rich in the US were recently
praised for producing an effective
form of rice rust (this was re-
ported by Dr. Humphrey at Wells
Soc. the following Monday).
Dr. Rose stated that CBW
(Chemical and Biological War-
fare) weapons need not be stock-
piled because many of them could
be produced cheaply and quickly
with simple apparatus and might
become used extensively by small
countries. The U.S. have started
to use a whole arena of new
weapons in Vietnam and the door
to their use must befirmlyclosed
now before it is too late.
Concerted action by scientists
could have some effect. CBW
research must be declassified. In
this country in particular the
micro-biological warfare estab-
lishment at Porton Down should
be " opened " (also suggested by
Dr. Humphrey at Wells Soc.).
Lethal gases
The US admits to using non-
lethal incapacitators but evidence
(apart from the fact that 2 Aus-
tralian soldiers died in "non-
lethal " gas when wearing gas
masks) shows that some of the
gases used are lethal if the dose
exceeds lmg. per person. The
"non-lethal" gases are commonly
used to flush people out of hides
to expose them to napalm and
machine guns. These operations
illustrate very well how the US,
by fragmenting information, ex-
ploits western methods of thought
to the full so as to justify what
they do.
Some of the gases used may in-
deed be non-lethal but when used
in conjunction with machine guns
they form an intrinsic part of a
killing machine. It is as mis-
leading to talk about the effects
of gas separately as it is to state
that the barrel of a gun is non-
lethal. The credibility gap of the
US army is still further stretched
when one realises that US troops
carry atropene (antidote to nerve
Moral Onus
The onus to be moral seems to
have shifted from the physicist to
the chemist and biologist but the
fragmentation of scientific disci-
plines must never be allowed to
prevent any scientists and engin-
eers from speaking out when they
should.
The responsibilities on the indi-
viduals concerned are heavy in
this case because the materials
can be produced quite easily with
the agreement of a much smaller
number of people than was the
case with nuclear weapons*. Dr.
Rose said that it is terrible that
there is so little discussion or
teaching at I.C. about the social
and moral implications of what
WE do.
Footnotes
1. A conference on BCW is* to
be held in London and will be
open to the public on the even-
ing of Friday, February 23rd.
2. Plans have been made for the
formation of a study group to
examine the evidence and
issues raised by Dr. Rose.
