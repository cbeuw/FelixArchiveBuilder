1. Theirs to reason why
Three third year students, applying for a job, seem
equal in all pertinent attributes, so the prospective
employer, also an intelligent man sets a simple problem
for them. The job, he says, will go to the first applicant to
solve it. A mark is placed on each man's forehead. The
three are told that each has either a black mark or a white
mark and each is to raise his hand if he sees a black mark
on the forehead of either of the other two. The first one to
tell what colour he has and how he arrived at his answer
will get the job. Each man raises his hand, and after a few
seconds one man comes up with the answer. What
colour is his mark, and how did he figure it out?
6. Truth
A FELIX newspaper reporter comes into Beit
Quad and does not know which way to go to reach a
fire on the roof of Botany. There are two men in the
Quad, one of whom always lies while the other
always tells the truth. The reporter does not know
which is which. He may ask one of the men only one
question to find his way. What is his question and
which man does he ask?

7. Slowly does it
An aged and, it appears, somewhat eccentric ICU
President wants to pass his most treasured possesion, a
Norton motorbike, on to one of his two friends (both
eccentric motorbike owners). He decrees that a bike
race shall be held and that the friend who owns the
slower bike shall have the Norton. The friends, each
fearing that the other will cheat by having his bike go
less fast than it is capable of, ask a wise professor's
advice. With only two words the wise Prof insures that
the race will be fair. What does he say?
2. Barnight
A student organising an inter-CCU barnight
manages to obtain seven barrels full of beer, seven
barrels half full of beer, and seven empty barrels.
Not wishing to offend any C C U he decides that
Mines, RCS and Guilds shall be given the same
number of full, half-full and empty barrels. Can his
wish be carried out? If so, how?

8. Letter maths
Supply a digit for each letter so that the equation
is correct. A given letter always represents the
same digit:
A B C D E
x 4
E D C B A
3. Ages
A nosey male student asks a landlady how many girls
live in her house and what their ages are. The woman
tells him that her three daughters live in the house, that
the product of their ages is thirty-six, and that the sum of
their ages is the number of the house next door. The
student goes next door and looks at the number of the
house. When he returns he tells the woman that the
information that she gave him is not sufficient,
whereupon the woman tells him, "My eldest daughter is
sleeping upstairs." The student thanks her and promptly
figures out the daughter's ages. What are they and how
does he know?

5. Labels
Three boxes are labelled "Rag sweatshirts", "Horrids
T-shirts" and "Rag sweatshirts and Horrids T-shirts."
Each label is incorrect. You may select only one garment
from only one box. (no feeling around or peeking
permitted.) How can you label each box correctly?
10. Hardware
A man goes into a hardware store to buy
something for his house. He asks the assistant the
price, and she replies, "The price of one is 24p, the
price of thirty is 48p, and the price of a hundred and
forty-four is 72p." What does the man want to buy?
