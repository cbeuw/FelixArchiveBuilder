M U H A M M A D IN T H E BIBLE?
As Christians we feel that we must make a public reply to
the pamphlet entitled "Muhammad In The Bible" that has
been circulated in IC over the past few months. While not
wanting to enter into a technical textual and Historical
debate just for the sake of it, nonetheless, it is very
important to examine the question of whether the New
Testament text is reliable. This article briefly does this and
also examines the inconcsistencies that appear to exist in
the author's method of argument. By way of reminder the
message presented by the author of the pamphlet is that the
"Spirit of truth" (or "Comforter") which Jesus talks about in
John chapters 14 and 16 does not refer to the unseen Holy
Spirit of G o d but the man Muhammad.
In m a k i n g our reply may we begin by
considering two statements made by the author.
The first refers to the author of John's Gospel
(the fourth book in the New Testament) as
" J o h n — an unknown writer in the second
century of the Christian era". The second states
that "some hasty editor was not satisfied with
the expression " S p i r i t of t r u t h " , or did not
understand it, and assumed that this must be
the same as the Holy Spirit . . . Such words are
found nowhere else a n d are obviously an
a d d i t i o n to the t e x t . " T h e s e a n d o t h e r
h y p o t h e t i c a l arguments (we use the term
hypothetical in the strict sense of the word) are
used to question the accuracy of the record of
Jesus' words, from which point the author goes
on to suggest what Jesus really said. So he
appears to rely on the reader of his article
unquestioningly accepting the commonly held,
but incorrect, view that the New Testament
documents have been proved unreliable. Many
believe that they were written a couple of
centuries after the time of Christ and have been
translated and copied out so many times since
then that vast numbers of words and sentences
must have altered, been missed out or even
added. But when facts are faced such views do
not stand up. Let's for example examine the
Gospel of John which is certainly not the earliest
piece of Christian writing in the New Testament
(see reference 1).
The earliest fragment of the Gospel now in
existence is dated at about AD125 and it is
generally accepted that the Gospel itself was
written between AD70—90 ie 40—60 years after
the crucifixion of Jesus. There is also strong
textual and traditional evidence that the author
was John the disciple of Jesus, not an unknown
writer and certainly not a second century writer.
T h e other three Gospels are also eyewitness
accounts of the life of Christ. As one would
e x p e c t the q u a n t i t y o f N e w T e s t a m e n t
manuscripts increases as we move into the
second, third and fourth centuries A D . By this
time we have literally hundreds of copies in a
d o z e n l a n g u a g e s : the 5th c e n t u r y codex
A l e x a n d r i n u s a n d the 4th century codex
Siniaticus (complete New Testament texts) both
reside in London in the British Museum with
m a n y other a n d e a r l i e r N e w T e s t a m e n t
manuscripts.
Also in existence is a complete set of the Four
Gospels each in papyrus book form and dated
before AD200. Admittedly, there are variations
between manuscripts, about 157 in the four New
Testament Gospels. The vast majority are very
minor and of the kind seen in Matthew chapter
3 verse 11 and Luke chapter 3 verse 16 where
John the Baptist is said to have baptised "with
water" while some manuscripts read " i n water".
What should be recognised is that not a single
point of Christian belief hangs on a disputed
reading.
The sort of time scales mentioned above may
still seem rather long, but Christian manuscript
tradition is in fact much stronger for the New
Testament Gospels than for any other ancient
book. The text of Caesar's book "Gallic Wars"
for example is based on a single ninth century
manuscript, ie a 900 year gap separates the
o r i g i n a l work from the earliest copy now
available. O n e final point to mention here,
before leaving the matter of New Testament
reliability, is the way archaeology has shed a
great deal of light on the Gospels and the book
of the Acts of the Apostles. Again and again
archaeology has vindicated their reliability.
Let's go back to John's Gospel for an example.
In chapter 19 verse 13 we are told that Jesus
was tried before Pilate at a place called The
Pavement (Gabbatha in Hebrew). Nobody knew
anything about such a pavement and it looked
like John was adding dramatic atmosphere to
the simple tale of Christ's trial until French
archaeologist Pere Vincent dug it up in the
1930s. It measured fifty yards square and can be
seen in the city today. For a much deeper study
of the reliability of the New Testament see
references 1, 2 and 3.
Having very briefly outlined the fact that the
Gospels are early and reliable (something that
even critical scholars now accept in the light of
so much evidence) we now turn to examine the
author's method of argument a little closer. O n
reading the pamphlet carefully it becomes clear
that his arguments are based on assumed
errors in the text for which he admits himself
there is no positive textual evidence available
(paragraph 4 sentence 6). H o w e v e r , for a
moment let us assume that the New Testament
is unreliable and see what the implications are.
Using a scientific analogy the author is saving
that he has got a bad set of data but he can
correct it (without having external evidence to
give his corrections any degree of authority),
and the corrected data fits in with his theory
and so proves it to be true. But the New
Testament is reliable and the authors textual
theory goes very much against the great weight
of " e x p e r i m e n t a l " evidence derived from
scholarly objective Biblical research. Indeed if
John chapters 14 and 16 are read in context
with both the O l d and New Testaments there
can be no mistaking the message that the Holy
Spirit of God was to and did begin a new type
of work among men.
In conclusion may we say that God's message
to man in the Bible and supremely through the
life, death by crucifixion and resurrection of
Jesus Christ is very clear. That message speaks
first of the enormous D I G N I T Y of man's
creation in the image of G o d (Genesis lv26,
Psalm 8v4, 5). It also speaks of the total
D E P R A V I T Y of human nature (Romans 3v23)
caused by man's rebellion against his Creator
and the reality of this Sin a n d resulting -
separation from God ending in death (Romans
6v23). Finally it speaks of the D E S T I N Y of man
which is the fearful prospect of death and God's
judgement (Hebrews 9v27, 28). It is at this point
that God's message of hope through Jesus Christ
comes in: G o d himself in Christ has dealt with
man's Sin and made a way for man to return to
Him. At this point Christians rightly tend to
employ certain pictures to explain the work that
Christ accomplished by dying on a R o m a n
Gallows (eg paying the ransom required that
man might be set free). Whether or not you find
the pictures helpful the reality is that Christ
bore the consequences of our sins (1 Peter 2v24)
and to prove his victory over Sin and Death he
rose from death never to die again (1 Corinthians
15v3, 8). G o d freely offers forgiveness through
Christ and new life through the indwelling of his
Holy Spirit for those who acknowledge their
need (1 John lv8—10).
T h e personal claims of Jesus C h r i s t are
enormous and his claims on us as individuals are
equally enormous. No doubt many people in the
past and today try to avoid these claims by
running away from the facts, but the truth is
that about 2000 years ago a Jewish carpenter
from a small town in the Middle East made
these claims and substantiated them by his
victory over the grave.
