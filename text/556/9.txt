As the examinations draw to an end, thoughts
inevitably turn to next session and the thorny
problem of finding accommodation.
Ideally, it would be nice to get fixed up with
something this term so that you don't have to
worry about it over the vacation. Unfortunately
this is not a very easy thing to achieve as most
landlords are not interested in giving firm
promises for the future which leaves the rather
unattractive alternative of finding a place now
and paying for U over the summer.
If you do want to book something now for
next term without having to pay for it over the
summer, the best place to inquire is the U L
Accommodation Office at 8 Princes Gardens.
T h e Welfare C e n t r e has a few bedsits
available which can be booked in advance and
we are hoping to get some more in the near
future.
Agencies, newspapers and noticebbards are
not much use for this purpose as they tend to
deal with current vacancies rather than future
ones.
If you don't manage to find anything this
term, then it is probably best to forget all
about it until September when it is financially
viable to take on a current vacancy even if you
don't actually need it until the beginning of
term.
T h e a c c o m m o d a t i o n m a r k e t is h i g h l y
competitve at that time of the year since there
is an enormous influx of students. This means
that the earlier you start looking in September,
the better.
Most people would probably prefer to live in
a flat than in a bedsit and one of the snags that
flat hunters tend to come across in September
is that landlords are. reluctant to let a flat
unless they can interview all the prospective
sharers before granting a tenancy. Since it is
quite frequent for one or more members, of a
group looking for a flat, to be away on holiday
or on a field trip at this time of year, difficulty
can arise and so it is a point worth bearing in
mind when you are planning your strategy for
finding a flat.
If you are going to find it difficult to come
down to London early on in September to start
looking, you can always ring the Welfare
Centre for addresses and then try and fix an
appointment with the landlady for a time when
it is convenient to see the place.
When you do start looking at places, one of
the problems that arises is if you are offered a
p l a c e w h i c h d o e s not c o m e up to y o u r
expectations and you have to decide whether
or not to take it or risk ending up in something
worse.
If you don't have any experience of living in
the private rented sector, it might be an idea to
try and look at some places this term, eg those
occupied by friends or you could even have a
look at places that arc being offered by the
various accommodation sources at present.
This will give you an idea of the standards and
prices to expect — bearing in mind that there
is likely to be some increase in prices by the
beginning of the next term.
If you are thinking of coming to look for
accommodation in September, there should be
some temporary accommodatin available in the
Halls and then in the Union Crash Pad. Details
of these schemes are not yet available, but
soon should be, so keep an eye on FELIX or
check with the Union Office before coming
down to look.
In September, possible sources of accommo-
dation will be:
University of London Accommodation
Centre (8 Princes Gardens)
This office is mainly concerned with finding
accommodation for freshers during this period
and so they won't have much to offer non-
freshers. The best time to use them is now
when they will have details of places that you
can book in advance.
Welfare Centre (3rd floor, Union Building)
Flat Agencies
These usually charge one to two weeks rent
for finding you a place. They also tend to deal
with the more expensive accommodation. A
list of agencies which have been recommended
by various people can be obtained from the
Welfare Centre.
Newspapers
These do provide a source of accommodation
but the evening papers are very widely read
and people queue in Fleet Street to get the
first edition. A s a result places advertised go
very quickly and so, although worth trying, this
a p p r o a c h is often m o r e frustrating than
productive. Local papers — eg, the Kensington
and Chelsea Post are read by fewer people,
but contain correspondingly fewer accommoda-
tion advertisements.
Noticeboards
A lot of sweet shops, etc, have noticeboards
with accommodation vacancies. They tend to
be past history by the time you get to look at
them but some have dates scribbled on them
which you can use to select the most recent
All in all, accommodation hunting can be
pretty hard work but perserverance is usually
rewarded. If you find yourself in a position
where you have to take something which
doesn't suit you, don't despair. As long as the
arrangement with the landlord doesn't tie you
to staying on there for a long time, you can sit
it out until the rush dies down and then start
looking again.
If y o u have any w o r r i e s about finding
accommodation, you can always come up to
the Welfare Centre for a chat about it.
VACATION MONEY
If you can't get a job during the vacation
(incidentally the Welfare Centre has a list of
vacation jobs) it is worth remembering that you
can claim supplementary benefit, which starts
at £16.35 per week if you are living at home
and goes up if you are paying rent. Y o u can
also claim unemployment benefit if you have
sufficient National Insurance contribuions and
the new contribution conditions that have been
imposed on students do not apply during the
summer.
L U G G A G E STORE
F o r those of you who are going to find it
difficult to take all your stuff away with you at
the end of the term, there will be a luggage
store in the Union Building. For further details
contact the Welfare Centre.

Barclays And South Africa
Barclays has traditionally been attacked for its
s u p p o r t for S o u t h A f r i c a on g o v e r n m e n t
projects.
T h e latest major s u c h v e n t u r e is its
investment in Sasol the South African State Oil
Corporation, in which Barclays National has a
£10million holding.
The South African government has frantically
been investing in oil from coal production in
order to cushion itself against any future oil
e m b a r g o . B a r c l a y s not o n l y a s s i s t e d in
providing the financing of this project but also
handled the selling of shares in Sasol on the
Johannesburg stock exchange.
The call for an oil embargo is an essential
step in bringing down the apartheid regime. It
should also be remembered that fuel is vital for.
the South African 'defence' forces continually
used to repress any opposition movement
against apartheid. Barclays should be exposed
for fuelling apartheid.
Barclays Bank Ltd has a 60% share of its
subsidiary Barclays National in South Africa. It
is therefore capable of stopping this support
for the regime ..in South Africa.
The other argument against Barclays is that
it is the biggest bank in South Africa.
Although it claims a progressive image and
doubtless could substantiate its claim to abide
by the E E C ' s C o d e of C o n d u c t its actual
employment statistics expose clearly the lie
that it can in any way be challenging the
apartheid system.
In South Africa there are employed 2,480
non-white clerical staff as against 13,000 whites.
Hardly an example of equality of opportunity in
a country with exactly reversed population
proportions!
Sir Anthony Tuke, Chairman of Barclays, at
their recent A G M justified little being done to
challenge apartheid by saying that the bank
had to work within the law. That also means
that the bank is subject to racist employment
laws and one can only doubt whether the bank
seriously c o n c e r n s itself with this problem
when as it readily admits its chief concern is-to
protect its investments and profit margins, not
to worry about 'political issues'. A p a r t h e i d
yields big profits by racist exploitation and
repression of the majority of the population. In
such a situation passive acceptance of 'the law'
is no d i f f e r e n t f r o m a c t i v e s u p p o r t for
apartheid.
Why Pick On Barclays In Particular? *
1. It is one of three British b a s e d b a n k s
involved in the Sasol financing (the others are
Standard Chartered and Hill Samuel) and of
those is the largest shareholder.
2. B a r c l a y s N a t i o n a l , the S o u t h A f r i c a n
subsidiary, is the largest bank in South Africa
and therefore operates under racist employment
policies and in many ways acts to prop up the
apartheid system.
What Can You Do?
1. Don't bank with Barclays.
2. Write a letter to the Union Exec/Council
calling for no more adverts to be placed by
Barclays in Union publications.
3. Support IC A n t i - A p a r t h e i d G r o u p . ( C o -
