RESIDENTS SAFE
AFTER BEIT FIRE
At 4:10am, last Saturday morning, Beit residents and their guests were
woken by a fire alarm. This time it was for real — flames leapt from Beit
roof.
£5000 worth of damage as ext-
ractor plant is destroyed by an
electrical fault.
Two police officers, who were on
E m b a s s y patrol, spotted smoke
rising from the roof. T h e police
went into the Beit m e s s e n g e r s
office and spoke to the security
officer, M r W i l s o n . T h e g r o u p
climbed up to the Botany roof.
They saw flames coming from a
shed and the police immediately
radioed for the fire brigade.
M r Wilson went back to set off
the alarm and to evacuate both
hostels. He went to each floor and
left the residents to spread the
word. One or two students banged
on the doors of the 'heavy' sleepers
and the hall was completely evacu-
ated in a few minutes.
T h e fire b r i g a d e c a m e five
minutes after the radio call. Fireman
with breathing apparatus checked
the South wing of Botany while
others used CO2 to put out the fire
on the roof.
Beit r e s i d e n t s , s o m e wearing
their night clothes, sheltered from
the rain by standing in the entrance
to C h e m Eng. After about forty
minutes they were able to return to
their rooms.
Loans to replace grants
Concern is being caused by the investigation of the Commons Select
Committee on Education into the possibility of introducing a system of
loans to students to replace the present grant system.
T h e possibility of introducing
such a system has been discussed
at intervals ever since the present
government came to power. It is
known to be favoured by a number
of senior ministers including Sir
Keith Joseph.
The Committee last week took
evidence from the secretary of the
C o m m i t t e e of L o n d o n C l e a r i n g
B a n k s , who offered the opinion
that the major banks would be
interested in any s c h e m e that
offered " a reasonably commercial
rate of interest", provided that
repayment was made over a reason-
able p e r i o d of t i m e , a n d that
certain safeguards were given.
Most of the evidence given to
the committee so far noints to the
introduction of a mixed system of
grants supplemented by loans. This
is the system used by most of the
European and American countries
who use loan schemes.
A c c o r d i n g to e v i d e n c e from
Professor C e d r i c Sandford, who
has for some time campaigned for
a loan system, a third of students
at Bath and Exeter expressed a
preference for loans in preference
to grants.
The National Union of Students
has already raised the question
with the Department of Education
and has made clear its objections.
The N U S is expected to submit
evidence to the Committee in the
next few weeks arguing against the
concept of student loans.
Vice-President Elect for Education,
Andy Pearman, explained: "Loans
don't do anything to extend access
to education, in fact they restrict it.
Those who benefit most from grants
are t h o s e f r o m w o r k i n g c l a s s
backgrounds; they would be deterred
from entering higher education by
the fact that they might not be able
to repay the loans taken out."
Red Cross Week

Thanks to all in College who

is very keen however, and together
we have decided to hold a meeting

the I C W A Lounge to discuss the
P r e s i d e n t - E l e c t ' s p r o p o s a l s for
I C W A and plans that the incoming
committee as a whole have for
next session. Your ideas will be
most welcome. G o o d Luck with
any exams.

London Student
The future of the newspaper London Student is under threat as a result
of financial pressures on its publishers, the University of London Union.
Each copy of the paper costs
about 7.5p to produce. Advertising
revenue is not large enough to
cover staff, printing and running
costs.
Unless College unions enter a
s u b s c r i p t i o n s c h e m e c u r r e n t l y
being launched for next year, it is
unlikely that U L U will be able to
continue to finance the deficit and
the paper will fold.
The scheme asks colleges to pay
2.5 per c o p y and distribute the
p a p e r free to m e m b e r s . 2,000
copies have already been ordered,
and several college unions have
also given verbal commitments to
join- the scheme. However, com-
pleted o r d e r forms are n e e d e d
before the end of this term if the
paper's future is to be secured.
L o n d o n S t u d e n t is the o n l y
London-wide paper written and run
by s t u d e n t s . T w e n t y t h o u s a n d
copies are distributed each week in
term time to colleges, polytechnics
and further and higher education
colleges, many of which are isolated
on the fringes of greater London.
Deborah Perkin, Vice President
( S e r v i c e s ) at U L U , s a i d in a
document sent to college unions
that if London Student ceased to
exist it would be " a sad day for
London students, and a tragedy for
London student unions".
