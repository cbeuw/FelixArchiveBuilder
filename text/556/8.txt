Several junior trainee officers, hoping to
b e c o m e s u c c e s s f u l agents of the C I A ,
listen to their lecturer outlining the basics
of intelligence gathering. " Y o u can learn
more about a country's military potential
by a careful study of the many specialised
journals devoted to defense subjects than
a c l a n d e s t i n e agent c o u l d d i s c o v e r in
years."
R e a d i n g m o r e t h a n 20,000 p i e c e s of
literature every month, is one of the tasks
of the C I A at t h e i r h e a d q u a r t e r s i n
Langley, Virginia. Most intelligence c o m e s
f r o m " a l t e r n a t i v e m e a n s " r a t h e r t h a n
spying. Soviet intelligence officers are avid
r e a d e r s of W e s t e r n p u b l i c a t i o n s of all
k i n d s . A b o u t e i g h t y p e r c e n t of m o s t
countries' intelligence requirements can
be met from such white (open or overt)
sources. A great deal can be learned from
reading and assessing newspapers.
T h e r e m a i n i n g t w e n t y p e r c e n t of
intelligence material can be learned only
by black (undercover or covert) methods,
a n d t h i s a l m o s t i n v a r i a b l y m e a n s b y
espionage. This material falls into four
main categories: plans, processes, politics
and pieces.
P l a n s i n c l u d e not o n l y the d r a w i n g
board type of plans that were once the •
number one item on the shopping list, but
also plans in the sense of "intentions".
Processes include m u c h of the material
currently given a high priority, such as
technological developments and industrial
secrets.
Politics covers all internal and external
political activity, from the jockeying for
power a n d position within a government
to that government's relations with other
countries.
P i e c e s is a t e r m d e r i v e d f r o m a n
analogy with jigsaw puzzles. In a jigsaw
puzzle it may be impossible to see the
whole picture if some pieces are missing,
so pieces are any items of information still
n e e d e d to a s s e s s or u n d e r s t a n d o t h e r
information already in hand.
O n e of the three m a i n r o u t e s i n t o
espionage work is from a university. In
the United States the intelligence agencies
have their friends on the campus, often
k e y p r o f e s s o r s w h o have c o n n e c t i o n s
with the secret world. A s in the U S A , the
British universities, in particular O x f o r d
and Cambridge, provide many recruits to
the British SIS.
The screening process for the C I A is
tough and it is an exceptional year when
m o r e t h a n 100 c o l l e g e g r a d u a t e s are
recruited into the agency. It has been
e s t i m a t e d that o u t of 1,000 p o t e n t i a l
recruits all from the top quarter of their
c l a s s e s , a b o u t 800 a r e s c r e e n e d o u t
i m e d i a t e l y b e c a u s e of a n u n f a v o u r a b l e
b a c k g r o u n d o r s o m e l a c k i n t h e i r
educational standards. The remaining 200,
w h o go t h r o u g h s e c u i r i t y c h e c k s a n d
personality assessment, are eventually
reduced to about 90. O f the 110 who are
e l i m i n a t e d at this stage, a b o u t 70 are
failed because of personal defects, such
as drinking, talking too m u c h , or homo-
s e x u a l i t y , a n d a b o u t 40 d r o p p e d f r o m
consideration for serious security reasons.

youH have heard of
Andrew Boyle and his
book that unmasked

do students become

gives a brief outline.

a spy.
O f the 90 who will be offered employment,
probably about 10 will finally decide not
to take up the offer. The remaining 80 will
be enrolled in the junior officer training
program.
Although intelligence work is supposed
to be exciting, the British recruit will find
that after initial training that although the
work sounds exciting, in fact a great deal
of it is tedious, boring and bureaurcratic.
Harry G o l d , the A m e r i c a n C o m m u n i s t
who as a go-between for Klaus Fuchs,
told his F B I interrogators when he was
c a u g h t : " T h e r e is difficulty in r a i s i n g
m o n e y for t r i p s . T h e w e a r y h o u r s of
w a i t i n g o n s t r e e t c o r n e r s i n s t r a n g e
towns where I had no business to be. The
killing of time in cheap movies and the
lies I h a d to tell at h o m e a n d to m y
friends to explain m y supposed where-
abouts. M o m was certain I was carrying
on a series of clandestine love affairs. It
was drudgery. A n y o n e who has an idea
that this work is glamorous and exciting
is very wrong indeed. Nothing could have
been more dreary."
