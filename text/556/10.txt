Dear Colin
I would like to make public my
grievances regarding the conduct
of some of the staff behind Stan's
Bar, Southside. Apart from being
unhelpful, unfriendly and arrogant,
things of which many people are
aware, they are also offensive and
foul-tongued. This I found to my
cost on Saturday night last when I
asked for s o m e c h a n g e for the
v i d e o - g a m e in S t a n ' s B a r . T h e
immediate reaction from one of the
barmen was: " F - k off, this isn't a
f-king bank".
This was not an isolated incident.
When another customer asked for
a packet of peanuts he received an
equally witty reply. ("Piss off, this
isn't a f-kine sweet-shop.")
Other people were given typically
gruff and unpleasant serive.
Surprisingly, when a customer
who had been waiting for about
five minutes for service, muttered
" S - t " under his breath, he was told
to mind his language by the other
barman.
Is it necessary to employ such
unpleasant people as bar-staff? Just
because we are students I do not
u n d e r s t a n d why we s h o u l d be
treated quite so deplorably.
I am looking forward to a reply
from w h o e v e r is r e s p o n s i b l e for
employing the bar-staff at Stan's.
Yours etc,

Dear Colin
' H o w nice to be in E n g l a n d ,
now that summer's here!' With all
the warm weather hitting London
lately, m a y I c o m m e n t to y o u r
columns how good I feel. Isn't it
lovely to walk across the Union
Q u a d a n d feel the soft springy
stone betwen one's toes. The way
the calm luxuriant flagstones reflect
their heatis pure ecstacy. O h boy!
A m I glad that our predecessors saw
fit to p a v e o v e r all t h a t h a r d
u n y i e l d i n g g r e e n g r a s s ! W h a t
forethought! Rue the day when we
have to revert to nature.

1. Since all three applicants raised their
hands, there are two possibilities: two
black and a white or three black. If
therefore, there were a white mark o n any
forehead, two students would see one
black a n d one white and would instantly
deduce that the third mark must be black.
Since this instant solution did not
occur, each of the three students saw two
black marks. Therefore all were black,
including the mark of the successful
applicant.
2. O . K . so you came up with an easy
solution - there are several. Pour four of
the half-full barrels together to make two
more full ones. N o w there are nine full
barrels, three' half-full barrels, a n d nine
empty barrels. All can be divided by three.
3. T h e landlady has a nine year old
daughter a n d two-year-old twins.
4. O n e of the terms is (x - x) therefore the
answer is zero.
5. Pick a garment out of the " R a g
sweatshirts and Horrids T-shirt box". Y o u
then know which label should be fixed to
that box. A s all the labels were initially
incorrect then the other two labels can be
simply exchanged.
6. The reporter should ask either man, "If I
were to ask you if this is the way I should
go, would you say yes?"
7. "Switch bikes"
8. A is 2, B is 1, C is 9, D is 7, E is 8.
9. H e added his own camel making the
division easy. 18/2 is 9, 18/3 is 6,18/9 is 2.
Since the total is 17, the wise man was then
able to take back his own camel and ride
on.
10. House numbers.
Barclays
At the moment there is no Union policy
covering the placing of Barclays adverts in
Union publications. However, I have
printed an article from the Anti-Apartheid
G r o u p at IC on page 9. Let's have some
letters o n this and other subjects for next
week's F E L I X .
Review
With a bit of luck, if you're still around
next week youll be able to pick up a F E L I X
containing a review of the year....
This week I have included a complete
do-it-yourself exam package complete
with certificate. I let you judge which grade
you should be awarded. At least you'll
leave Imperial with one paper qualification!
Thanks
T o T i m , M a z and Ian also to the
hardworking Marie-Therese Weech who
seems to be able to contentedly fall asleep
in the F E L I X office during the day! Even
when we're panicking to beat deadlines
and trying to induce people to write
articles.

A WARNING
T h e c u r r e n t , d i s g r a c e f u l l y i r r e s p o n s i b l e
behaviour of residents in Southside is likely to
lead to a serious breakdown of relations with
Mews residents.
The hurling of objects out of Hall windows is
both d a n g e r o u s a n d a n n o y i n g , a n d i f these
objects are bottles then the action becomes
potentially homicidal.
Whether or not the c u r r e n t spate of bottles
emerges f r o m Southside, the Halls only draw
suspicion on themselves by the continued shower
of weighted paper darts, carrier bags filled with
water, cans, etc, on the mews side of the Halls.
I view the allegations of bottle throwing even
more seriously and any students or guests of
student residents can expect no help from me i f
they were to be asked to leave College, a n d
indeed, I would support the College line on this
issue.
If this practice, and that of abusing persons in
the Mews, continues, a private detective is going
to be hired with the a i m of amassing evidence
and prosecuting individuals. It is therefore very
important that those responsible persons who
live in Halls clamp down on the lunatic fringe
and prevent this happening.
