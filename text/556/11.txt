! ! ! IMPORTANT ! ! !
As everyone knows, good accommodation is very hard to come by and many IC students are
doomed to spend a period of misery in expensive squalor.
If you are living in reasonable accommodation at present and are expecting to move out of it
for good in the near future, it would be a great pity if the opportunity for an IC student to live
there next year was lost.
Some students, mainly PCs and those working in London over the summer, are looking for
accommodation from the end of this term.
It would be very much appreciated, both by the Union and by students who are and will be
facing the problems of finding somewhere to live, if you could help in one or more of the
following ways.
1) Come to the Welfare Centre {third floor, Union Building) and give us details of
your accommodation.
2) Jot down the details on the back of this sheet and send it to the Union Office via
the Internal Mail.
3) Detach the bit at the bottom of this sheet and give it to your landlord/lady.
Prompt action could save a fellow student from a lot of anguish.
Thank you for your help.
Michael Arthur
Welfare Adviser
PS: If you found your accommodation through the U L Accommodation Office in Princes
Gardens, you needn't do anything as they will already have contacted your landlord/lady.
