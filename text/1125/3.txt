In brief...
LSE Referendum Result Dodgy Accommodation
the result of the LSE referendum on
whether or not to leave ULU was a con-
clusive 'no'. Almost one thousand votes
were cast, with over 60% of those who
voted choosing to remain part of ULU.
Given the vague wording of the refer-
endum, which details no immediate
plans for the split and lays down several
conditions that must be met before LSE
would leave ULU, many observers had
expected a 'yes' vote.
E-mail Change
Microsoft Outlook is now providing the
main email service throughout college,
following changes made over the sum-
mer vacation.
Whilst departments which provide
their own email servers, such as Com-
puting, are unaffected by the change,
the majority of staff and students are
now using Outlook, along with Union
Clubs & Societies' email accounts.
Via Outlook's WWW interface, at
http://outlook.ic.ac.uk/, email can be
reviewed and replied to from any com-
puter on the Internet.
Although CCS encourages every-
body with a Outlook-based email
account lo switch to using Outlook,
P0P3 compatibility is retained for other
industry-standard mail clients, such as
Eudora or Netscape. Problems have
arisen, however, due to uscts having to
change rarely-touched settings. Where
departmental assistance was offered,
problems were short lived, but some
Union clubs are still not able to read their
email.
Anyone still having problems should
contact the CCS help desk
(ccshelp@lc.ac.uk. or x49000).
Socialist Worker Protest
Members of the IC Socialist Worker Stu-
dent Society were demonstrating against
university tuition fees outside the Sci-
ence Museum on 30 October. Six stu-
dents handed out flyers, collected
signatures for a petition and sold copies
of Socialist Worker. Robin Pitt, the
group's leader, said "We at SWSS are
sickened by the Government's attempts
to make University education the pre-
serve of the elite. If we want the kind
of science and development displayed
in the Science Museum to continue, we
have to be prepared to pay for the edu-
cation of our future scientists."
SWSS are supporting the national
demonstration against tuition fees, at the
University of London Union, on the 18
November.
The Royal Academy of Music Union has
been approached by a pushy bloke who
is trying to offer accommodation for
about £30. Needless to say the whole sit-
uation seems a bit dodgy. His name is
'Michael' and he appears to be targeting
students' unions. Anyone who comes
into contact with this man should avoid
having any dealings with him, and report
the incident to Felix or ICU.
Con-man in Eown
A con-man is travelling around students
unions, posing as a Spanish student who
has been robbed of all his possessions.
He visited Cardiff University Union on
Tuesday 20 October where he managed
to obtain money, a meal, a bed for the
night and bank details of some of the
students. He Is approximately ST 0", over-
weight, with dark hair and was wearing
jeans with a blue/green sweatshirt, and
claims to speak virtually no English and
complains of being robbed of all his
money and documents whilst asleep on
a train. He stated that he is an Erasmus
student travelling from Holland. The
police are aware of his activities and he
was last seen in Exeter.
Get a Job!
Words to fill even the hardiest student
with dread. But don't worry, your union
is here to take away some of the strains
of milkrounds and traipsing round Lon-
don, because at Imperial the compa-
nies come to you.
Imperial College Union runs the
biggest independent Careers Fair in the
country, and this year it's even bigger
and better with 47 world leading com-
panies attending. The Careers fair takes
place on Wednesday 18 November from
11-4pm. All you need to do is make
yourself presentable, turn up and turn on
the charm - how easy can life be?
To help you get prepared, there will
be a free booklet with brief details about
each company, and some advice from
the College Careers Service.
If you want to be really clued up
then the Careers Service can be found
in the Sherfield Building, Room 310 and
it's open 10-5.15 Monday to Friday.
Fire in Union Toilets
High spirits at the Union
on the night of Friday
30 October turned into vandalism, when
one of the men's toilets was set on fire.

According to :\

stairs with copies of

was then placed on
top and ignited.
The Ents and

as "extremely irre-

using the toilets at

concluded.
The person or
persons responsible
have not yet been
identified.
