Presidential Talk-Back
Over the first few weeks I have had var-
ious students come into my office,
enquiring about their NUS cards, which
entitle them to student discounts. We
are not in the NUS, so the logical con-
clusion is that we can't get their dis-
counts. This is right in some cases, but
not in the majority; if a company adver-
tises student discounts, then we are enti-
tled to them with an Imperial College
Union Card, if they disagree then they
are falsely advertising.
lo try and simplify
some of the prob-
lems, I am putting
a day of my time aside ('Dave's
Discount Day' Monday 16th
November), in which I will bar-
gain for discounts from any
company that students want
me to and clarify with others
that our cards are acceptable
to them. So if there are any
company's out there that you
think we could pos-
David Hellard, ICU President sibiy get a discount
from, or who
already supply NUS students
with one, but not us, then
please email me
president@ic.ac.uk with the
details or pop into the office.
I have also struck a deal with a
firm called SNAPfax, who are
based in Edinburgh and this
year are venturing into Lon-
don. Next year they will supply us with
discounts across London for free that
NUS cardholders may not be entitled to,
they have been very successful in Edin-
burgh and Manchester and should prove
to be just as successful in London.
A Better Life?
???? Sorry that was me just trying to
figure out all... some... o.k. just any
â€¢ of the advantages of being a student
and to tell you the honest truth I can't at
this precise moment in time think of a
single one that's worth mentioning.
We're stuck in a traffic jam, (what's
new....it's one of the necessary evils of liv-
ing in London). It's something that I've
got used to. Now, instead of wasting my
time getting annoyed and frustrated I use
this valuable time to think and reflect,
because let's face it people don't really
get a lot of time to ponder, due the
busy, hectic pace of life.
I ask my friend (I hate my timing
too..) who is at present in the middle of
a three-point-turn (forward-reverse
manoeuvre, we're informed by my
learner-driver teenage sister). We're just
on our way to an cxpresso bar (a bit
posh, I know) in High street Kensing-
ton. We're trying to prevent our non-exis-
tent-at-the-moment coffee-social life from
taking a fatal nose-dive. It's a Eriday night
and, we've been driving around for forty-
five minutes trying to find a parking
space but we don't seem to have a hope
in hell of finding one. I could digress at
this point and tell you
exactly what I think
about traffic wardens
and the lack of park-
ing spaces in fondon
but it would be quite
fruitless and boring
and beyond the
scope of this article
as they say!
Anyway where was I ah yes I put
the question to my friend, who smugly
replies "the three letters, a degree, a
better life at the end of". OK fair enough
she has a point but what else? Besides I
can't think that far ahead.
What exactly is the advantage of
being broke all the time despite having
a weekend job, a host of supposedly
low-interest loans, that monthly life-sav-
ing cheque from your parents? It's not

as if you get any respect from anyone
either. It's a well known fact that every-
one detests and despises students even
former students hate students. You'll
find yourself hating
students in time, once
you've been pro-
$f moted to the ranks of
the therapy-depen-
dent elite members of
society.
The Virgin cinema
and music discounts
in handy though, thanks
Richard! About time with the under-
ground rail discounts. The other student
discounts in desperate little backstrcet
non-Rentokil approved restaurants, that
fail to make it into the 'time-out' guide,
are something I could quite easily live
without. Who said that being a student
meant a care-free-no-worry nonchalant
existence? Bills to pay, Idealistic rotas to
follow, washing, these are not effortless
tasks. I've been known to be so drained
do come
after an evening spent sorting out the
phone bill with my flat-mates that I have
had to cancel prior engagements.
Someone once said that going to
university means converting an empty
mind into an open one, wise words... it
also means converting a positive bank-
balance into a very negative one. All the
suffering and anguish in the quest for the
acquisiton of those three or four letters
that are supposed to arm you with the
ammunition to tackle the whole weary-
eyed world and set you apart from the
rest.
Despite everything, I think most us
deep-down, enjoy the once in a life-time
masochistic experience. Whenever I feel
disillusioned and dispirited I will remem-
ber the reassuring words "a better life at
the end of it!" Ah a parking space is
revealed to us not a double yellow
line ...great. Is it worth it now....? 'What
the degree or the coffee?'
Medicine Matters
T
he medical school is dead, long live
the medical school! This sentiment
was inspired by a comment that was
made at the ICSMSU meeting last Tuesday
indicating that the first year medics felt a
bit left out. I can understand and sympa-
thise with their predicament. They arc
totally separated from the other IC medics
who are based just about everywhere in
London apart from South Kensington and
at the same time they are separated from
the rest of South Kensington by virtue of
studying medicine. The medics have no
home, no base where they can go and be
medics.
This is primarily a failing
of the Alexander Iteming
building which, for all its
technological sophistication does not
really do much to support the medics
pastoral needs. The great thing about
Charing Cross, St. Mary's and loathe
though I am to say it, UCH and King's and
St. Thomas' is that they all have medics
bars whete you can go and you arc guar-
anteed to meet other medics. It is zero
effort socialising, you don't have to explain
who you are and what you do, if you walk
into the bar the odds are that you will
know someone, and even if you don't
everyone in the bar under-
Nick Newton stands what you have just
been doing and can sym-
pathise if you're on take or if you've just
had a crappy day.
The medic's SU committee has spent
a lot of time and effort trying to keep
something alive lhat, hard though it is for
some of us, myself included, to accept, is
dead. We cannot go back to the old days
(I will resist the urge to claim they were
good) and I don't think that we should try.
The foundation of ICSM is a chance for us
to create something new, a medical
school that is spread across many cam-
puses and yet has a home at IC. This may
be politically incorrect from a medic's
point of view but it is the only way that this
year's first years can hope to get the social
support that they need.
Everyone from the second years to
final years knows how important this social
support is in the life of a medic. Whether
it is finding out which lectures to go and
which to miss, or which books to get and
which exams are worth passing, the rela-
tionship between the first years and the
rest of the medical school is vital and is
more important than the petty rivalries
characterise in the medical school.
