The Custodians

Whenever I pick up a book as thick as the
Custodians, a 500 page epic, my mind
always travels back to the summer that I
spent reading Anna Karenina, the less
famous but equally brilliant 'little sister' of
War and Peace, and I always wonder
whether the autor of this new book will
in any way achieve the same depth of
immersion into the world of the charac-
ters in the book. On this occasion at
least, I was more than satisfied.
In a word, the Custodians is brilliant.
A remarkable fictonal account of a group
of friends who grow up together in the
suburbs of Adelaide in Australia, brought
together from disparate backgrounds,
from the welath of landowners to the
poverty of refugees. The story begins in
the 1960's. with Jane, Wendy, flspeth,
Alex, and Ziggy,
the refugee
from Lithiania.
At school, they
know each
other well, but
as they grow up
and head on
into adulthood,
they all make
very different
life choices, leading
them into situations and ',:.:.*..;."
experiences that they ;.
could have never
dreamed of in the early
days. Then there isjoise, the Catholic girl
who cannot go out in the sun, and Clcve,
the Aborigine, stolen from his parents by
the White men's welfare, adopted by a
white family as a token gesture to thank
God for there own son, and then packed
off to a boarding school, imcrsed intoa
racist world where he was not welcome,
and with no roots of his real origins to
hold onto.
Parallel to the story of these friends
runs the stroy of Daniel, another Abori-
gene, stolen from his parents and sent
from institution to institution, then to

prision, a young
boy, given no
opportunity to live,
and cursed for it by
a society that
belives that Blacks
should be made-
white, 'for their
own sake1
and
Clove's twin
brother.
With a depth
of knowldge of a
myriad of facets of
society, and using
reallife events,
emotions and details of governmental
actions, Nicholas Jose weaves a story
that sees these chracters meet up time
and time again, their lives becoming
more entangled the further, apart they
think thay are going. The main purpose
of the story is a comment of the treat-
ment of the Aborigines by the Colonial-
ists, and an examination of who Australia,
and indeed the whole world really
belongs to. The friends grow up in a
society that claims to be right, but which
is essentially white, seeing the Aborigines
as secondary citizens and believing that
it is in everyones interests to eliminate
any culture other then theirs. But then
the friends reach adulthood and become
the new Custodians of Australia, and
they have to decide what is right for the
future, and how the wrongs of the past
can be atoned. Should land taken by
the Colonists be given back to the Abo-
rigines, or should it become land for
everyone, making no distinction
between cultures, letting the world
inherit Australia, rather than those who
happened to be born there.
The plot involves a sustained politi-
cal debate about the Aboringines and-
Colonialists, and the more general
debate about minority suppression, but-
not in an overpowring way, and also
finds time to examine realtionships, and
love, the characters deciding what Is
most important to them. The plot cli-
maxes (as would be expected!) at the
end, in a meeting of plots tha does the
author credit and which closes the story
in the ideal way.
No review can really give you a feel
of what it's all about though. Go andread
the book - it's £7.99 well spent!
