Antz * * * * 1
/ 2
Starring : Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone
Director: Eric Darnell, Tim Johnson
F
irst we had Toy Story, then we had
Small Soldiers, and now we have
Antz the most recent totally com-
puter-generated movie. Visually this film
is spectacular and the good news is that
it has a plot to match.
Set in the world of an ant colony,
Woody Allen is the voice of our unlikely
hero; a measly worker ant called Zee.
These ants are humans in ant bodies but
they do retain some of their ant charac-
teristics. It's a case of 'boy meets girl boy
loses girl boy gets girl again and saves
the day'. "Oh no not again!" you shout
but this is different. They're ants for a start
and there is no soppy stuff. Even though
this film is for kids Antz is sending out all
the right comedic signals to young and
old alike. These ants forget what they are
when it comes to the jokes, as most of
the gags are deliberately poking fun at
insects.
There is a star-studded line up of
voices including Sylvester Stallone as a
dumb soldier ant, Jennifer Lopez as a
worker ant, Gene I lackman as an evil
general; Dan Akroyd and Christopher
Walkern turn up as well. All the voices are
cast extremely well but Danny Glover's

voice, as Barbados the soldier, is the
one that stands out the most.
It is definitely a Woody Allen film for
people who don't like Woody Allen -
especially if you can't stand the sight of
him. This will change your mind, as Zee
is adorable - even if he does talk too
much. This film is all round entertainment
and everyone should watch it as it has
everything that you should desire from
a film. •

Coffy •••1
/2
Starring: Pam Grier
Dir: Jack Hill
P
am Grier, star of Quentin
Tarantino's Jackie Brown, first
achieved fame in the 70s
Blaxploitation films of Jack Hill. Of
these, Coffy is often considered to be
one of the most subversive and serves
as an excellent introduction to the
genre.
Emergency room nurse Coffy (Grier)
holds a couple of local drug dealers
responsible for her sister's recent death
from an overdose and takes a decidedly
hands-on approach to vengeance. Pos-
ing as a strung out junkie so desperate
for a fix that she will do just about any-
thing, she presents the pushers with an
invitation they are not about to decline.
Once within shotgun range however,
her persona changes dramatically and
her victims' sordid excitement turns to
terror. Their executions begin a violent
killing spree as Coffy works her way up
the criminal chain of command towards
the mafioso at its head. While this under-
world hierarchy keeps the black man
firmly rooted at its base - a point elo-
quently made in the polemic of Coffy's
politician boyfriend - it is the film's
female characters who come off worst.
Exploited and humiliated by pimps or
seemingly present for ornamental pur-
poses alone, their treatment frequently
makes for uncomfortable viewing,
although it is never very long before
their male oppressors come to grief at
the hands of Coffy's one woman hit
squad.
The current fascination with all
things '70s will do the sales of this video
re-release no harm at all, but there is a
lot more to it than stacked heels and a
funky soundtrack. Q
