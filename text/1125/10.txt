Right Angles To Reality
Mind the Gap
G
ap Kids is opening a new store
in fall '98. For those of you for
whom English is your first lan-
guage, I'll translate: American cloth-
ing manufacturer Gap will be opening
a new children's shop in autumn of
this year. Were this major fashion
event occurring in the United States of
course, no further explanation would
be necessary, however the projected
outlet in question is to be sited in
Whitley's of Bayswater hence the need
for clarification. Whilst it is not the job
of this columnist to encourage or dis-
suade you from purchasing any of the
merchandise available from the afore-
mentioned retailer (although I would
advise that the lime green polyester
sweaters with the bold orange and
heliotrope floral design be given a
wide berth), or to comment on the
shameless use of the inimitable slogan
"Khakis Rock" to persuade the 18-25
age group to buy trousers that are
quite obviously nothing more than ex-
Army surplus left over from the Battle
of El-Alamein, I felt that the wording of
the announcement that heralded the
imminent arrival of this, their newest
branch in central London could not
go unremarked upon.
Those of you not possessed of a
wanderlust and who thus seldom ven-
ture forth into the
wilds of darkest W2
may not have heard
of the emporium
within whose good
portals The Gap
have chosen to
locate the base
from which to
launch their
impending foray
into the juvenile
clothing market
west of Hyde Park.
In the words of that
most superlative of sleuths, Hercule
Poirot, leesten to me ahnd you shell
leurn everysing. Situated on the
Queensway with its gleaming facade
towering majestically over the other-
wise nondescript roofs of the locale;
boasting shops, restaurants, cafes, and
a multi screen cinema to boot, White-
ley's is an alabaster temple to the god
of consumerism; a shrine to what has
become the central motivating force of
Western civilisation as we limp blood-
ied and bruised to the end of the twen-
tieth century and peer sweaty-palmed
in anticipation over the precipice of the
'...Naf-Naf... an
appellation so
pointlessly self-
referential, it
needs no
explanation)...'

twenty-first.
You get the picture
Whiteley's is a shopping
centre, although if the announcement
from The Gap is anything to go by, it
won't be long before it is a mall. More
worryingly, according to a close friend
of mine who, being French is naturally
much better informed than I on the
matter of haute couture (you might
not believe it, but this columnist actu-
ally passed French at 'O' level, albeit
only just - I almost failed due to my
mistranslating fin de siecle and coup
de grace as "cycling
enthusiast" and "to
mow the lawn" respec-
tively), "Gap" actually
stands for "Great Amer-
ican People". Of course
a business can call itself
anything it pleases, and
set alongside compa-
nies with names like
Tandy, Muji and Naf-Naf
(an appellation so point-
lessly self-referential, it
needs no explanation)
seems pretty reasonable
(and you'll be relieved to learn that
there is one) is that with that kind of
in-your-face moniker, Gap's marketing
strategy for Bayswater is clearly not
going to stop at one
or two boutiques in
Whiteley's. There
goes the neigh-
bourhood. How
long, I wonder
before all the shops
on the Queensway
cease to trade six
days a week and
begin to open
"Monday thru Satur-
day" or Boot's the
Chemist is sucked
into the Uncle Sam
Linguistic Re-orientation Program to
emerge as Col. Jesse's Drugstore.
Before you know it, the many inde-
pendant grocers that line both sides of
that thoroughfare will be selling soda
pop, candy bars and "sem-eye"-
skimmcd milk - although sales of fags
will no doubt plummet.
It may have already started. Shortly
after leaving Whiteley's I was offered
the option of having my hamburger "to
go" (although where was not speci-
fied) at a well-known fast food restau-
rant that maintains a franchise in the
Bayswatcr area. As it is not within my
Matt Salter
remit to offer free adver-
tising to multi-national
corporations, I will for-
bear to mention the name of said
establishment, save to note that in my
case, they utterly failed to live up to
their principal advertising slogan ("You
want it your way at (name of interna-
tionally reknowned hamburger restau-
rant). You got it"). The way I wanted it
was "free" - an option apparently not
catered for in their marketing strat-
egy. The manager of the branch in
question seemed to be completely
unconcerned about this
blatant breach of the
Trades Description Act
and was most unsym-
pathetic to my requests,
as were Carl and Win-
ston who kindly agreed
to act as my escorts out
of the shop and into
the gutter.
Please don't misun-
derstand me - I don't
dislike Americans.
Many of the people I count amongst
my closest friends are citizens of the
USA, and some of them can speak
English quite well. It's also untrue to
say that I am unreasonably chau-
venistic about my mother tongue - I
love languages, I'm fascinated by
them, and let's face it, if ever there is
a language that has
been shaped by out-
side forces, it is Eng-
lish. A propos of
which, loan words (vide
supra) are fast becom-
ing a sine qua non of
educated conversation,
and their bone fide
usage in describing the
cultural Zeitgeist has
become de riguer
amongst the intelligen-
sia, making them the bete noire of
students of the English languge. The
many bon mots which originated
beyond these shores but which are
now permanent fixtures of English are
to be welcomed with open arms, lov-
ingly caressed, rolled around the
mouth, savoured for their exotic nature
and the richness and depth that they
bring to the language. By and large,
they have been given British citizen-
ship precisely because they concisely
and stylishly fill a void of expression left
by etymological shortcomings of native
words. Try finding suitable home-
Try finding suit-
able home-grown
substitutes for fait

papparazi and see how far you get.
But the thing that is guaranteed to
cause me to breathe heavily and acti-
vate the nervous tick that first devel-
oped when I lost Â£3.72 in a single
session on the penny slot machines at
the pleasure beach at Hunstanton in
1 977, is the gratuitous use of words
like "fall", "trash can" and "restroom" in
a woefully misguided attempt to
appear cool and "Generation X" (what-
ever that is: answers on a postcard). In
my book, these words are fine if you're
American, not fine if you're not but just
wannabe. I've been to the US and it
is as fine a place as you could want to
visit. Whilst there I took great delight
in having my eggs "easy over", drink-
ing a "regular" coffee (or should I say
"cawfee") in Starbucks and checking
house prices in the Princeton area in
a "real estate" agent's shop window. 1
even purchased a couple of pairs of
very reasonably priced "pants"
(although I drew the line at buying
"suspenders"). And do you know
what? I did not feel linguistically com-
promised once, because seen in their
native habitat, these words look happy,
well-fed and comfortable. Transplant-
ing them to London W2 makes them
looks as embarrassed, uneasy and
incongruous as Barbara Cartland in
jeans and a T-shirt.
As I got up out of
the sea of empty
burger boxes, soft
drink cups and half
eaten, but still red-hot
apple pies that had
been left in the road-
side where Carl and
Winston had uncere-
moniously dumped
me, I resolved to con-
tinue posting letters
instead of "mailing"
them, to dispose of my household
refuse in dustbins in preference to
throwing "garbage" in "trash cans", and
to empty my bladder in toilets rather
than in "bathrooms". Have I made Ihe
right choice? You bet your sweet ass
bubba. Maybe it was my imagination
but even my old nemesis London
Underground appears to agree,
because as I boarded the tube home
I could swear that I heard a voice
telling me to "Mind the Gap".
