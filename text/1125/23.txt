don't get me wrong. Freedom is
:heap or nasty, and ii certainly
crusty clubbing. The door policy

an effort, whatever their style
may be. You'll find top-off ravers
dancing right next to dancefloor

Competitions!
Now, 'cos we're such lovely people we
haven't just got one competition for
vou. We've got twice as many as that.
Nymph@Mass - we've got two tick-
ets to give away for Saturday the 14th of
November courtesy of those wonderful
folk at Mass. Roger Sanchez is dropping
In for this one so it should be good
slraight-up house music at its best. Also
if you give the Nymph people a call
(0181 767 9925) and say that vou are
replying to Felix's Special Nymph Offer
(phewl), then they'll let you in lor a spe-
cial price of ten quid (instead of four-
teen). All vou have to do is leave your
details with them and they'll do the rest.
Freedom@Bagley's - and we've also
got two tickets to go and ponce around
in Freedom's stunning 2nd birthday bash
on Saturday the 14th of November. Gra-
ham Gold is in the main room for this
one and I'd try your hardest to get hold
of these tickets (bribing me will work, by
the way), 'cos this is a truly special night.
The night is being filmed by MTV, and the
tickets will allow you to mingle with
some famous faces.
To win these wonderful prizes all
you have to do is e-mail me and then I
will pick the lucky winners out of a hat.
The winners can collect their tickets from
the Iclix office in Beit Quad this week.
