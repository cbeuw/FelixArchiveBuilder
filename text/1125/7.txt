Letters
ask at the medical campus librarys. The
result of my day was this:
I managed to find 20% of the refer-
ences I needed, having been presented
with an Inter-Collegiate pass to get access
to the remaining 80%. And where could
I find these obviously rare journals? UCf.
This severely questions Imperial College's
commitment to having a world-class
medical school. Further questioning and
probing brought to light the fact that
the stocking of the medical section of the
Central Library had been hindered for
eighteen months by a bureaucratic bat-
tle between the College Librarian and
School of Medicine staff. Well, that's
great.
First IC asks Waterstone's to provide
the UK's leading academic bookstore at
this College, only to discover months
later that following a takeover of Dillons,
the company plans to reserve that hon-
our for its new Gower Street branch.
Then, the College's own supplies of
books and journals are held up in a red-
tape nightmare whilst UCf get the best
libraries, books, and to top it off,get the
same degree certificates as the rest of us.
But that, I suppose, is another issue alto-
gether...
Sorry - this has gone on. Congratu-
lations on producing a top-quality news-
paper. Good job.
With regards,
Andy
Comic Complaints
Dear Felix
Hi, I like reading Felix, especially the
informative part about 'Around IC, 'Exhi-
bitions', 'Computer Games' and the next
events. But this comic... I mean this
'Outcast Ben' Comic was really dirty, but
at least, if not anything else, it had an
ironic touch or sort of. This week's comic
isjuct crap, it isn't even funny and it def-
initely spoils felix. So do me and other
eager readers a favour and skip that
f.Jng comic, or if you have nothing bet-
ter for this page, just leave it blank!
Yours sincerely,

Dear Felix,
I would like to add to the letter from the
Disappointed Fan last week in question-
ing the taste of the comic strip featured
two weeks ago.I'm really disappointed
that you have resorted to deliberately
including gross and offensive material In
Felix just to get a response. I am partic-
ulate^ appalled at the derogatory words
and images used to describe women in
that feature. Are you aware that the col-
lege has anti-discrimination regulations
and that these cover written distributed
material. I find the use of the word c*"
as offensive when describing women as
the word n***" would be to a black stu-
dent. Racially offensive material is quite
rightly intolerable in this university so
please explain to me why sexually
derogatory material is not treated in the
same way!
Female students are a minority at IC
and their rights and feelings should be
considered in areas that they are involved
in -this includes IC union and as a result,
this paper. Felix isn't the top shelf men
only paper of IC, kindly leave the smut for
the locker room.
yours also disappointedly,
female student 4th year
p.s I don't include my name as in the
past any women writing to comment on
sexism in college has had anonomous
replies calling them frigid, ugly, repressed
etc printed the following week - rather
proving their point!
Ok, you asked:
The cartoons are unfunny, cringeworthy
and juvenile (these are the ones whose
author seems nob-obsessed). Other than
that, you are your usual self.
Cheers
Phil
I did Indeed ask, and thank you for
replying. As for the point that 1 should-
n't publish material "just to get a
response", provoking debate and dis-
cussion Is one of the alms of these pages
(in this case what is the line between
entertainment and discrimination).
Given the number of people at IC who
read Viz, the comic strips could be said
to fall within the 'entertain the reader-
ship' criteria. Personally, I've never
bought a comic. Anyway, point taken.

Dedicated to Democracy?
Dear Felix
I was amused by the article about the LSE
in Felix 1124. Did the students really go
to the poles to vote?
With best wishes,
Yours sincerely,

Broadsheet Bias
Dear Felix,
I would like to draw attention to the
bizarre stocking policy of the ICU
newsagent. It seems that by 10 o'clock
every day The Sun has sold out whilst
stocks of The Telegraph arc very healthy
and The Times positively bloated.
Is this some underhand plot to sup-
press the tabloid readers of college?
Sun readers of IC unite!
