Dune 2000
Virgin Interactive
Six long years has passed since the
grand-daddy of RTSG (real-time strategy
games), Dune 2, first burst upon our 14-
inch VGA monitors. That translates
roughly to a century in cyber-tlme, con-
sidering the quantum jump in computer
performance. If that is the case, then
what is about Dune 2000™, which is
essentially a remake, not a sequel to the
Westwood, that can move the hearts of
us gamers?
Nostalgia is one. For the uninitiated,
Dune 2 is THE GAME in 1992, pioneering
the concept of real-time war-gaming.
The storyline for both games have
remained essentially the same - the
vicious Harkonnen, the insidious Ordos
and the noble Atreides, fighting to gain
control of Spice, the only valuable
resource of the planet Arrakis. The simi-
lar setting instantly places old gamers on
familiar ground. Units have remained
mostly unchanged, i.e. the stealthy Sonic
Tank, gas-spewing Deviator and good
old Devastator still hang around. The
Engineer and the Thumper are new units,
allowing the capture of enemy buildings
and subsequent production of enemy
high-tech units. On the whole, the
Harkonnens are slow but a tough nut to
ctack; the Ordos move snapplly but pay
the price with weak armour and the
Atreides, a compromise between the
two.
What about gameplay then? The
interface has changed to a Red Alert
style with a Construction and Unit side-
bar on the right. However, this means a
serious drop in gamespeed since you
can only build one unit at one time,
whereas having 2 Heavy Factories in
Dune 2 would have allowed the con-
struction of 2 units concurrently. More-
over, the lack of a building queue
coupled with the frequent out-of-stockat
the Starport means that it takes an annoy-
ing long time to build up your base.
Nonetheless, the addition of FMV,
which boasts John Rhys-Davies of Wing
Commander and TV show Sliders fame
• fk.
and the inclusion of numerous music
soundtracks certainly make Dune 2000
shine compared to its predecessor.
You've got to see the Hollywood-style
explosion when your Harvester hits a
Spice Mound.
Perhaps the most important feature,
besides the ability to form teams, the
Internet multiplayer option. This will gives
those of us the chance to see how good
we really are, given the same units in
1992.
The final word? If you are desperate
for the latest in RTSG gameplay. go for
Starcraft. If you wish lo relive the good
old days of Dune 2, then go ahead and
buy the game. By the way, look out for
those tank-gobbling Sandworms.

Spellcross News
Well, when I got the demo of this game,
which I knew nothing about and had
never heard of before, I said "Ah, must
be one of these no-good excuses of a
strategy game from desperate compa-
nies who try to stay alive". But I was mis-
taken, at least partially. What Spellcross
is all about is a fight between the Alliance
(i.e. Mankind) against the Forces of Dark-
ness (i.e. These ugly ores who try to
dominate the land). As far as its sce-
nario in concerned, it is OK - a bit com-
mon but with several interesting "peaks
of originality". As far as its technical part
is concerned, well, I only need mention
that it is a DOS based game (or at
least the demo is); that's right, no
DirectX, no fancy stuff, just plain old
DOS. I must admit, though, that for
a DOS-based game, it has tathcr
good graphics and sound (unfortu-
nately, the demo only included a
monotonous tune so the only good
idea I have about the sound of the
game is from the video part of the
demo).
Game-play is another matter; if
you like having like thousands of
controls, you'll
like it. If on the
other hand, you
ike straightfor-
ward games
where your only
choices are
select, move and fire,
you will probably hate
it. It tries to follow
Microsoft's as-real-as-
it-gets strategy and so
gives you lots of
options and lots of
controls.
Now, to be more specific, in Spell-
cross, you have the ability to invent new
technologies and produce new (and
bloodier) units (sounds all TOO familiar,
doesn't it). You can also do research of
some sort, but I'm not so sure how that
helps you. The good part, though, is that
once you have made up your army and
are ready to attack, you are taken to
another interface where you actually
place your units on a map and play the
attack all the way - so you can't blame the
computer if you actually lose all your
units. That's probably the best and
coolest feature of Spellcross.
Overall, I found Spellcross an OK
way to pass your spare time, if you like
strategy games, that is. It has lots of
units (about 70 or so) so you really have
lots of options, but it also requires that
you think your way through, so I do not
recommend it to thOse who just want to
seat in front of their PC and start shoot-
ing people around with miniguns and
BFGs.

Sin Bin
Those nice guys from activision have
given us some sin stuff in a nice red
folder. All the good stuff out of it has
gone and all that is left is a picture of
Elexis's real life persona - real name
venessa. This season 'ncss' is wearing a
fetching red rubber outfit and thigh high
leather boots. To compliment this fan-
tastic prize is a limited edition red wine
flavoured condom - in its fetching black
cardboard outfit. So the first and possi-
bly the worst prizes of the year go to the
person who comes up with the best
reason to own two such works of pro-
motional art. Either email felix@ic.ac.uk
or drop your suggestions into the felix
office.

Lara
Desparate for a bit of publicity, Peter 'red
hot hetro' Mandelson presented a mil-
Icnium product award to Core Design for
their Tomb Raider I & II products. With
over 10 million sales in the world since
1996, a new episode and a film on the
cards for next year things look quite
busy for poor lara. Lets hope she is
given next Christmas off.
