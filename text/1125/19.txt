ROBBIE WILLIAMS
I've Been Expecting You
KB
Hello, my name's Robert.
R
obbie Williams? Don't disregard
this album. Ok, his first solo
album didn't do too well at first
but eventually got to number one. This
one has the potential to do better much
more quickly. This is probably due to
the success of his recent single
Millennium. On first listening you think,
'not sure about that' then you listen to
it again and it begins to grow on you.
Before you know it you are singing
along and tapping your feet. Sad but
true!
Listening to the opening track for the
first time had me thinking I was listening
to Oasis. The intro sounds so similar to
any old Oasis song. Sampled from the
Bond film You Only Live Twice, Robbie
puts his 'favourite strings part ever!' into
Millennium. The distinctive vocals of Neil
Tennant (The Pet Shop Boys) come
through in No Regrets, who is one of the
guests on this album along with Nicole
Appleton (All Saints)
Most of the songs are easy to listen
to and will never be hits in their own right
except maybe Jesus In A Camper Van.
The album is definitely improved by the
two hidden tracks if you wait long
enough at the end of the album.
Robbie has now definitely left his
Take That days behind him and moved
on by appealing to a wider audience. His
lyrics are definite a sign of long awaited
maturity and he is establishing himself as
a reputable songwriter. The album is
influenced by a Bond theme but is he
going to be the new James Bond?
Stranger things have happened, you
know. Do you remember that bloke who
left a successful pop band to start a solo
career? H

PJ HARVEY
Is This Desire?
PJ Harvey. Have they expired?
S
o often I'm written about as a
sort of dark, black-magic witch, a
sort of man-hating axe-wielding
cow from hell was what PJ I larvey said
in a recent Big Issue interview-an opin-
ion that many may stick with in light of
her latest offering, Is This Desire?
Although some of the tracks here
suggest something of the new-found
happiness that she professes to have,
some are as angry as anything she has
done before. The lyrics toJoy ate shouted
out whilst the heavily distorted monoto-
nic bass gives a real feel of aggressive
tension. My Beautiful Leah is also char-
acterised by its ditty bass and although
more subdued than Joy it is equally as
grim with lyrics such as 'She only had
nightmares. And her sadness never
lifted'.
Virtually every song on the album
has references to other people, all with
different problems: My Beautiful Leah
who is 'better off dead', Catherine who
T damn to I lell' and another Catherine
who dreams of 'children's voices and
torture on the wheel.' Although it could
easily be the case that all these people
are acquaintances, it seems more likely
that they ate names given to her differ-
ent emotions and moods. This is first sug-
gested by the opening line of the whole
album where she sings 'My first name
Angelene,' hinting that her other char-
acters maybe pseudonyms too.
Despite the mostly downbeat lyrics,
the music isn't generally correspondingly
gloomy. Joy and My Beautiful Leah are
both at the extreme end of the albums
musical spectrum. It is notable that these
two songs are both proceeded by totally
contrasting songs that have a definite
funkiness to them. Indeed, The Wind is
vaguely reminiscent of U2's Lemon, with
strings that could have been lifted off a
Propellerheads album. This does a lot to
raise the mood of the album as a whole,
making it considerably more easy to lis-
ten to.
The single A Perfect Day Else
(playlisted on IC Radio) is the most heav-
ily layered song on the entire album,
and the most chart friendly. The synthe-
sised bass sound is the biggest clue to
the sound of the rest of the album,
although like the mood of the song in
general, it sounds much more tamed
and chirpy.
Is This Desire?should not disappoint
fans of PJ Harvey. Musically, it is richly
contrasting, although it does occasionally
push the boundary too much towards
the dark side for most peoples tastes.
Don't expect to see her on Top of the
Pops, n
