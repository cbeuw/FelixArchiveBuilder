IC 55 -15 Greenwich
The game kicked off with IC piling on the
pressure. The first ten minutes proved
to be fruitless, with a missed penalty
and a disallowed try. In the 20th minute
the floodgates opened with a magnifi-
cent forward try scored by no. 8 Charlie
Curre. Dave God scored the second try
from open play in the 30th minute. After
35 minutes #8 Chucks struck again and
finally the first conversion was planted
sweetly between the posts. Minutes
later Nipply scored with aerial accelera-
tion bringin the half to a close at 22-0.
Merely seconds after kick-off, Chucks
brawled in again under the posts, notch-

IC 10- 14 UCL
It was a time of heros. A time when boys
put away the toys of childhood and
became true men. It began as a war of
afflicition with the forwards dominating
and the IC squad camped on the UCL
line. The backs attributed themselves
well despite the scrappy conditions, with
good tackling and defending by James
Notaies and Tim Jones on their debuts.
The scoreline at the end of the first half
was a creditable 0 - 0 . This, however,
ing up his hat trick, which was converted
by Chris Dickenson once again.
Moments later scrum half Gabriel scored
over an open try-line to land beautifully
under the posts, neatly converted by
club captain Dave Hogg. In the 55th
minute Dan "Pharoah" Higazi rumbled
through the entire pack to put himself on
the scoreboard, converetcd by Chris
Dickenson once again. IC then had a
15 minute drought (during which Green-
wich scored a lucky try, but failed to con-
vert) until the mighty Kaizer (60th minute
sub.) dragged two of the opposition
over the line to get his first try of the sea-
son. Will Stenns converted and then put
the last try past Greenwich in the 71st
minute using his silky skills.
Andrew Little
was not due to continue. Two quick
backline tries in succession put IC an
unfortunate 14 points behind, within the
opening 5 minutes. IC rallied after this
shocking start, scoring themselves from
some sexy support play and silky running
by Dave White, eventually touching
down just by the 5m line and unfortu-
nately the conversion was put just wide
of the posts by the novice kicker, Jamey
Notaie. Another well worked piece of
forward play resulted in Joe Robinson
going in just wide of the posts. Again
the conversion was missed. Bad luck
Jimmy. All in all an equal match which
unfortunately ended in the wrong result.
Women's Rugby
IC Virgins 10-10 UCL
After the trashing IC received at the
hands of UCL last year, we approached
the match with some trepidation.
Despite the fact that IC were three play-
ers short and gave away a try in the first
5 minutes, we fought back well with a
superb run and try from Clare B. to even
the scores.
A brilliant move form UCL, in which
2 of their players tripped over each other
and twisted their ankles, evened the
numbers. IC then spent the whole of
the second half camped on UCLs try
line. Despite the forwards getting the
ball down over the line, the ref did not
see and the sustained pressure led to
another try by Claire. UCL scored just
before the final whistle to even the
scores.
Special mention to Claire S. against
her old team and Jen for carrying on with
an injury. Thanks to Matt for the coach-
ing.
Netball
IC 70 - 1 Wye
After a delayed start due to the late
arrival of Wye College, and having to
clear the water logged court, IC were rar-
ing to go.
After a few minutes It became clear
that Imperial were going to triumph
AGAIN, extending their unbeaten record
this term.
The infailable accuracy of the shoot-
ers Sally (with her shoot-better hair cut)
and Rebekah (scoring even when the GS
was off the court), ensured a compre-
hensive victory of 70 goals to IC, 1 by
Wye College.
Good luck in future matches!
Hockey
ist XI
IC 5 - 0 St. Georges
The game was a comlete mess at the
start with a pair of umpires that did not
have a clue, with everyone deeding to
make up their own rules. Jambo Bwana
finally brought his shooting stick with
him and after going past several defend-
ers slipped a delightful bail past the
stranded keeper.
Despite some top notch goals there
still remained the shocking misses and
a scrappy one from the hat trick man
Jambo, combined with some of the best
umpiring around (get the impression
more than one person is writing this
report? - Gus). The score could have
been much higher but Noddy did his
best to keep it down, firstly by deflect-
ing a goalward bound shot right on the
line, then by missing two complete sit-
ters. By half time, IC were in a com-
manding 3-0 lead and the second half
started in an equally one sided style.
The umpiring began to improve
apart from the ref's language which got
worse and worse, especially with refer-
ence to Big Titties. IC contrived to dom-
inate the game and even started to
enjoy it!
Disco Squad
(formerly 3rd XI)
IC 0 - 0 UCL
Before I start the report I would just like
to establish that Fabio looks good with
his towel on his head and his tackle
swinging in the breeze.
Well, we played UCL that is the Har-
lington astro and they were scum. But
they were scum that equalled our
mighty hockey talents.
In a well matched game play
bobbed back and forth more often than
Jokers' head on a Saturday night in Soho.
The disco attack force came close
on many occasions. Lager Lager, known
for constantly slapping the post, lived up
to his reputation. The Sundance Kid
fought from the wings and Indian Car-
pet Catalogue dealt as well as he could
with a defender who earned his nick-
name of "the Flying Lumberjack".
Pete Tong as ever defended his
entrance with a fanatical zeal. Nice.
And finally: (To the tune of Urn
Bongo in a disco style)
Here comes BAPS, he's got VD
We know coz CASANOVA said
"He got it off me!"
DISCO BOYS!
I thank you.
X-Country
Imperial put out an awesome men's
team but again was lacking a women's
team. Bethan finished third to consoli-
date her respectable position in the ULU
league.
The men fielded four teams with
Ben Flukins leading the field early on
and finishing a comendablc 5th. The
remaining 1st team members were Taz
(14th), Jodie (20th), Headley (27th) and
Mike (29th).
Welcome back Yellowarse and
thanks to all those old favouritics that let
us down. Out of a field of 100 plus, one
fifth were Imperial runners. We look for-
ward to the next race at Wimbledon
Common. As our entire women's team
graduated last year, an incentive to any
new female athletes is a night of free
drinks with many fit lads! Contact

Ski Club
This was the first race of the season for
the renewed IC ski team and its not so
new race teams (Freshers - where are
you??). We left with huge ambitions for
victory and arrived in plenty of time to
check out the course.
Our first race (IC I) was against Kent
III, who we thought were a bunch of
posers, and thus had a great desire to
beat them. "But as desire increases, suc-
cess decreases." (Alcohol and Girls,
pi 34) and it must be said that they
"posed" very efficiently and beat us.
From then on we were in the
league for 7th to 12th position, won all
our races and came 7th.
IC II came not too far behind. We
also entered a combined IC and ICSM
girls team which came 1st in the girls
and a combined IC and Royal Holloway
Snowboard team which came first.
I take this occasion to thank ICSM
who lent us some darn fast skiiers. On
a note of pride, all our teams beat UCL
(who used to race with us last year).

est around)), write to skl@ic.ac.uk.
