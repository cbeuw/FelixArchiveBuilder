MATERIAL EVIDENCE
Courtauld Gallery, Somerset House
I
n 1780, the Strand block of Somerset
House accomodated the exhibitions
of the Royal Academy of Arts and
other learned societies. It was unique in
that it provided a scries of rooms
designed specifically for the exposition of
artwork. Today, the gallery is part of the
Courthauld Institiute of Art and houses a
combination ol
permanent and
short-term exhibits.
The building itself
is an attraction,
with elegantly
crafted ceilings
and spiralling
stone staircases,
but it is the inher-
ent simplicity that
lends itself to the
display of pieces.
The founder
of the Institute,
Samuel Courtauld,
was also a major
benefactor of this • ~"
collection. Consequently, the most
famous Impressionist and Post-impres-
sionist artists jostle for recognition on the
top floor. However, the exhibition also
reaches back as far as the 14th century.
As you ascend, you are transported
through the ages, culminating in what is,
in my opinion, the highlight of the
gallery's offerings: Room 12. Temporary
exhibitions.
The current occupant of this space is
Material Evidence. This innovative pre-
sentation aims to provoke an increased
appreciation of the displayed pieces, by
exploring the different media available to
the artists. It emphasises the difficulties
posed by these
tools and presents
the response from
various "masters"
such as Rem-
brandt, Constable,
Van Gogh and
Cezanne.
The most
remarkable aspect
of this study is its
encouragement of
visitor participation.
Inspired by the
atmosphere of
concentrated tal-
ent, you can sit and
:
experiment with
the materials which were used to create
the famous works. Quills and ink, char-
coal, graphite and chalks are al! pro-
vided, as is information about their
origins. Accompanying extracts from edu-
cational journals, dating from the 17th to
the 19th centuries, then desctibc the
accepted techniques and approaches of
the time. In this way, the Courthauld
achieves its purpose; it didn't take me
iong to realise how much skill was
needed to temper these tools. An exam-
ple is the work by Guercino entitled
Mother and Child (pictured right). By
contrasting a smudged red chalk out-
line with hard, strong sketching, he
expresses the soft
skin of a baby against :
the rough fibres of
its mother's skirt.
Another point 1
which is stressed, is |
the diversity which
can be attained from :
;
the same starting |
point. None of the I
displayed pieces j
appeared to be the I
same due to the oil 1
fering styles of the j
artists. Thctc is a final |
section in the exhibi-
ion enlilled I \ i i e i i
ments". This has
been included to make sure that we
bear in mind the fact that artists should
never be restricted by their materials.
Often great and famous pieces have
been produced when the artist defied
the approved standard. In A Road
Through a Wood, Thomas Gainsborough
combines the dusky colours of iron oxide
chalk with the substance generated by oil
paint; as a result, the painting comes to
life. At the time, red chalk was generally
used for fine detail and oil paint applied
quite thinly, but by turning these con-
cepts around, an amazing vibrancy could
be achieved.
The desire to challenge seems to
; be a common
theme for the Cour-
tauld and future

BALLA AND FUTURIST ITALY
Estorick Collection
T
he setting of this gallery is beau-
tiful - a lovely old Georgian house
in Islington. It has been restored
to accommodate the large collection of
Italian modern art owned by Eric and
Salome Estorick, now deceased. As well
as the permanent exhibits on display, the
Modern Art Gallery in Rome has recently
loaned twenty works by the most promi-
nent Futurists.
This exhibition charters the move-
ment from It origins just before the First
World War to the end of the 1930s. It
begins with the fascinating paintings by
Giacomo Balla dating from 1910-1915; he
applies the ideas that Marinetti
enounced in his futurist manifesto.
Speed, technology, noise and mechan-
ics - terms that define the Futurists' desire
to promote the technological progress of
the 20th century. In his pieces (Mercury
Passing the Sun, Observed Through the
Telescope, pictured centre) Balla is visi-
bly influenced by work created at the
time: the Cubists (and later the Surreal-
ists), Klee, Leger... Colours
often represent particu-
lar ideas or moods. In
Pessimism and Optimism
for instance, he portrays
negative vibes in black
and positive ones in blue.
Other interesting paint-
ings include Fillla's
Mechanical Idol, in which
the technical world is rep-
resented as a replace-
ment for God and
religion. The second
gallery then concentrates on the later
output of futurism, from the end of the
1920s until the Second World War. The
innovative technique of "Aeropainting" is
illustrated here with a beautiful work by
Despero entitled Lunar Prisms (pictured
left), as well as a painting by Marinetti's
wife, Benedetta. futurism certainly
evolved over the years and troughout the
generations, but still remained faithful to
its original concepts.
The rest of the gallery is devoted to
quite an extensive display of Italian mod-
ern art in general. The exhibits include by
Musicby fuigi Russolo, a festival of bright
colours and imagination,
and works by Gino Sev-
erini, another very influ-
ential I uturist. I was also
pleasantly surprised to
find Chitico in the col-
lection, as his distinctive
style inspired Dali and
Magritte amongst oth-
ers.
Further on, the col-
lection focuses more on
sculptures by Marino
Marini and Emilio Greco
(nothing very interesting though), finally,
the last room displays lots of drawings,
some early Boccioni, a few sketches by
Modigliani {Tete et Buste de Profit avec
Boucle d'Oreille, pictured righOand sev-
eral very funny political cartoons. A lot of
these tend to resemble Picasso or
Matisse, too much in fact to be taken seri-
ously. Overall, this collection has a lovely
feel to it and I can imagine going there
several times to have a look at a partic-
ular work I liked. It is also a nicely timed
exhibition, proving that the Futurists had
a point and defended their art strongly
despite all the bad reactions they
received at the time. Futurist fans like me
will relish seeing paintings previously
unknown. The modernity and magic of
it will enchant others not quite so famil-
iar with this movement.
