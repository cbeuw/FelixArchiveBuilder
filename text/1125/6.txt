Letters 9 November 1998
In Counter Attack of
Estates
Dear Felix,
Following the letter by lan Caldwell, may
I congratulate you on the response.
Where do these people from the Estates
division come from and what on earth
are they doing in such important posi-
tions at Imperial?
May I firstly remind lan that although
the sums of money involved in the envi-
ronmental improvements are 'relatively
small in terms of the £60 million of devel-
opment1
it is still £110,000, money not to
be scoffed at. Furthermore, if the Estates
division is so worried about 'unsightli-
ness1
of the campus, as quoted by Ken
Young in issue 1123, why on earth did
they allow the plans to go ahead in erect-
ing the unsightly, if not slightly phallic
monstrosity more commonly known as
the 'temporary' boiler house? No won-
der the college has such an 'appalling
reputation' with the local planning com-
mittee.
If the local planning committees
expect the Estates 'to act more respon-
sibly', as quoted by lan, then may I sug-
gest that the Estate money would be far
better spent in improving the student
and staff facilities, such as the common
rooms in the departments, or the
appalling kitchen and living facilities in
student halls, rather than on some
flowerbed - aesthetically pleasing to the
eye maybe - but not a lot else. After all,
the college is for the students, staff and
research, not for the birds and the bees
- although some might like to think - or
hope so. With Hyde Park just up the
road, why do they want to invest in a
small flowerbed anyway?
Well, I've had my sulk. I'm just glad
that the Estates division isn't deciding
my future.
Yours,
Ruth
What's This? A Petition?
Mr Editor,
Assuming that everything printed, theo-
retically, has to be approved by your
good self, then no doubt you have
noticed the recent succession of pieces
that have been written about medics.
Medics are now an integral part of
Imperial College, and as such one would
expect to see the odd piece on medics
every now again.
However you and your budding
journalists at Felix for some reason have
decided to conduct what appears to be
a systematic campaign, the result of
which is the portayal of medical students
in a bad light.
Starting with your edition on the 2nd
of October you claimed that the CXWMS
union made a loss of more than £40,000
, this coming from - "a source"-1 seem to
recall the tabloids also have similar pro-
clivity as regards the use of these
unnamed "sources". Further more, if my
memory serves me right CXWNIS went
out of existence on 1 August 1997, so
please explain how a non existent insti-
tution could have a union, I think you will
find that the said event was organised by
ICU @ Charing Cross!
Despite your faliure to be a har-
monising and positive influence on the
relationship between medics and non
medics, you seem happy to proceed to
the other extreme of worsening the sit-
uation by allowing elements such as the
"Voice of Reason.... Simon Baker" in the
same edition of Felix to exacerbate the
situation, by being non too comple-
mentary about our fellow medical stu-
dents at Mary's Campus !
Your distinguished journalist, Andy
Brown not having been able to think of
anything interesting to write about (in
true tabloid style) proceeded to put the
proverbial foot in as regards the financial
arrangements at the Charing Cross ball,
specifically about the £85,000 suppos-
edly spent and the £7000 on Champaign
.... again in true News of the World style,
the clear statement by the former Deputy
president of the Union, Nick Carter, that
only £600 was spent on Champaign was
ignored because of course £7000 docs
sound better for the readers, never mind
the truth ! Suspect book keeping was also
alleged despite the offer by Mr Carter to
allow the books to be inspected, libelous
if you ask me.
I and many others think that Nick
Carter, and Andy Hecps did an excellent
job for the union and the students and
as such should be commended for their
commitment and dedication.
Not satisfied by their earlier allega-
tions the issue of October 26 continued
in the same vein this time the Rugby
Medics were on the receiving end of
FELIX journalism.
You also couldn't resist mentioning
the doctor who just happened to have
worked at Charing cross hospital getting
£500,000 for having an accident with a
needle, your head line being rather com-
plementary you forget that this must
have involved great personal tragedy to
spend 5 or 6 yrs at med school only to
have to give it up!
All this was brought to a head by
your sensationalist Tabloid style head-
line on your most recnt issue, which at
first sight seems to tar medics, this time
with derogatory brush of racism
well done Mr Ofori you don't seem
to have noticed that the maority of stu-
dents at Imperial arc form the Ethnic
minorities.
It is clear that FELIX staff hold medics
in contempt, and I suggest you should
modify this attitude as it doesn't help the
current undercurrent of friction that
already exists between medicsand non
medics
It is in every ones interest that we all
get along instead of readers being
amused at the expense of medics in a
fickle excuse for journalism.

Why I Should Have
Been Shot at Birth
Dear Sir
I feel compelled into writing following
comments made about Medical Students
in the letters page of issue 1123.
I agree wholeheartedly with the
comments made. I know several first
year Medics, and they are so far up their
rectal passages... [etc etc. - Ed]
So, what's the point? Well, the nub
of the issue is that while doctors are lit-
tle more than sawbones and quacks, the
real donkey work of modern medicine is
carried out behind the scenes by
chemists and medical physicists whose
work is rarely acknowledged.
Yours piously
The Censors
You really are a small and twatty
man/woman/men/women. Please read

luxury of reading. - Ed
The Return of Heeps
Dear Edward,
I had planned to maintain a degree of
secrecy since my departure from office;
however, your caption competitions, ICU
Council and D Robinson seem to have
scotched that idea. With reference to
the latter two of the aforementioned
articles, I shall restrain myself to this: the
BUSA issue is one of the few subjects
that stirs up debate within the College,
and for ICU to treat it with anything less
than the utmost urgency would be fool-
ish; as for D Robinson, I can categorically
state that I do not know that person at
all, but I would like to thank him for
over-rating my Presidency so publicly.
Last week I was asked by the ICSM
Light Opera Society to represent them at
an ICU Disciplinary Hearing. The alleged
crime was one of putting posters on the
lecture theatre wall of our brand-spank-
ing-new, vastly over-priced greenhouse
on the south of the Queen's Lawn. Upon
remeoval of the offending items
(secured with blu-takand sellotape) great
chunks of lecture theatre came away in
our hard-working cleaners' hands, with
only a week until Her Majesty raced
through the building. The architect, Sir
Norman Foster went ballistic, and con-
sequently, a few Pro Rectorial ears were
bent. Quite apart from the subsequent
issue of senior College staff instructing
the Union how to go about its business,
it did make me wonder: did we really pay
at least £80M for a building where the
walls could not withstand a few blobs of
blu-tak and strips of sellotape? My advice
to medics and biologists is this: don't sit
near a wall in that building without check-
ing its stability first. Or borrow Simon
Baker's hard hat if you do.
One of the more fortunate sides to
the ICU Presidency is this: you don't have
to go near a textbook during your time
in office. Consequently, trips to the library
are not really commonplace. So imagine
my surprise when I visited the Central
Library last week, clutching a list of med-
ical references to read, only to be told
that there were no substantial medical
academic journals held on the South
Kensington Campus. Fine. I thought, I'll
