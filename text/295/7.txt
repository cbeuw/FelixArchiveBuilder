"OH I NEVER SAW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT"
Thursday midday, a most decorative, if slightly bemused young lady came to my office
with orders from the Editor of FELIX to chat me up and get a feature article on General
Studies to plug some Editorial gaps by midnight Saturday.
Now plugging gaps is something we understand in General Studies, Lecturers get 'flu,
hosts fail, films don't turn up. So sympathising I sat down, long after the corridors of
College Block had been dimmed out and wrote a solemn history of General Studies from
its enthusiastic inception in 1952 by Sir Roderic Hill to its present state of institutionalised
respectability with declining audiences. In the morning, my secretary, who had burnt no
midnight oil, said; scrap it; all that guff about opening minds, sounds like an enema. Don't
write history, write about now. Write about what it is like to be you with 132 gaps per year
to fill.
CULTURAL REVOLUTION
Gaps to be filled with
stimulating, entertaining and
enlightening titbits, to entice
weary students to give up
their free time. For that is
what General Studies is. We
cannot offer you higher
course marks or anything
directly relevant to your
studies. But we do try to pro-
vide a worthwhile founda-
tion / background / starter to
as wide a variety of subjects
as possible. Subjects which
range almost as widely as
there are descriptive cate-
gories: philosophy, sex, relig-
ion, theatre, politics, history,
archeology, banking, poverty,
films, poetry, economics,
art, jazz, mortgages, music
—you name it—no, seriously,
that is all you have to do—
tell us what you would like
to have a talk on and we will
try and find the best speaker
available. This is not always
easy nor are the results al-
ways successful; the most
distinguished 'name' may be
a disastrous lecturer; the
the most intriguing title an-
nounce a dead bore.
In the past, series of lec-
tures on themes such as philo-
sophy, Marxism; a specific
area of art, or poetry, or
music have drawn consistent
audiences. This points to the
genuine desire of students to
go beyond the superficial and
(where we hope in future,
the Associated Studies dis-
ciplines will take over. But
if we can, through a chance
dropping in on a lecture, or
recital, stimulate a new in-
terest or keep alive one that,
through the pressure of other
work, might be dropped, we

feel that General Studies is
doing a good job. We work
closely with the Societies and
can provide the finance to
promote speakers for an ex-
cellent series as the Third
World Society organised re-
cendy.
We have been at the bot-
tom of the plan to turn the
Anteroom into an Art Gal-
lery and are only waiting for
the signal to go, to install
lighting and have properly
mounted exhibitions (which
will surely make this area
of the College a very much
more alive place. For music
lovers there is a concert
every Thursday in 53 Prin-
ce's Gate in the Mathematics
Library.
A l l this adds up to a pretty
alive and buzzing programme
to suit very varied interests.
Yet one has only to talk to
people to realise how many
students do not really know
what is going on or even what
General Studies are. But
this term every Freshman had
a green folder with details of
both General and Associated
Studies lectures in their
Freshers envelopes; every
student, as he registered, was
given one; every week we
scatter the departments with
a rash of posters. Yet we are
constantly being told 'Oh I
never saw anything about it.'
We are most grateful to
F E L I X to give us this oppor-
tunity to present General
Studies to your readership.

you think would make
an interesting lecture, or

tell me. General Studies is the
one area of the College where
you, the students, have genu-
ine power to order and direct.
General Studies is for you so
make use of it.
P.S. It has been suggested
to us that reports of General
Studies might be printed in
FELIX for the benefit of
those who could not go and
also as a record.
Now at last! The cultural
revolution is born! I.C. is in
its second year of a 'lefty'
president and as the year
drags along more and more
of us are despairing at vot-
ing a lefty back for a second
year.
Imperial College flourishes
under a cultural union—the
administration is pleased
and consequently helpful,
'ndustry is pleased and
gives us money to build new
laboratories, Halls of Resi-
dence, etc. (Piers' derogatory
comments at the time of the
Queen's visit is reputed to
have resulted in £100,000 be-
ing withdrawn from the Col-
lege and many letters of
complaint from old members
of the College). We live and
thrive in a cultural union.
NUS
I.C. Council in the past
few years has been domina-
ted by a lefty clique. These
people gave away your
money to NUS to back
large expensive and largely
futile campaigns. In days
gone by the President spent
your money on you by pro-
viding entertainment and by
distributing larger sums of
money to the constituent
colleges, I C W A and the
Athletics Clubs. These are
the institutions in which we
ought to invest all our
money together with R C C
and SCC and not with the
NUS.
U S K
When the University of
S o u t h Kensington was
originally invented we all
thought what a superb idea
a chance to do diversified
subjects instead of nasty
mathematics, mining or
whatever. But do we really
need it? NO! I.C. is inter-
nationally known as one of
the foremost colleges of
Science and Technology.
The formation of U S K
would kill this reputation
and create just another uni-
versity that no one has
heard of. The other col-
leges don't really need us
and far more to the point we
don't need them.
Left-wingers find it all too
easy to sit on their back-
sides in smokey rooms
criticising Barclays, apar-
theid arms sales to South
Africa. Fair enough but
these are not things for I.C.
Union to decide. We have
(or rather had) a healthy de-
bating society to debate
issues such as these, and our
political societies exist for
those who wish to demon-
strate and contribute help to
these causes. Do we pay our
President to take her lefty
clique away to Margate to
play games with hundreds of
other lefties at their useless,
expensive conferences or do
we pay her (and our secre-
tary) to work for the Union.
The president feels that the
members of her own union
are incapable of making up
their own minds about O T C
etc. and bars them from our
freshers fair — criticise her
yes and learn from her mis-
takes. Gain in knowledge
and the revolution must win
but remember we will never
bar lefty Soc from our
freshers fair just because it
encourages para-nuisance on
our campus plain.
The first quarter of the
year has seen the President
devote almost all her
energy to political fields and
virtually none to any I.C.U.
business which is what she
is paid for.
Now is the time for you
to support the revolution
and soon will be the day
that the revolution conquers.

Record Review
So we wanted to review records. But first we had to get
records. So we don't recommend Philips for anything —
' N O ! ' they said — ' G O O D B Y E ! ' they said ('shit' said we).
Transatlantic however are helpful and so next issue we will
be reviewing both the new Pentangle and John Renbourne
albums. President tried to give us a lot of records but they
only have crap like reggae and soul and yuk! But they are
pushing a new group called 'Ghost'. This is a very versatile
group with a fairly original sound; they have two vocalists,
one very like Sandy Denny and one I could have sworn was
Roger Chapman of Family — but isn't. The album 'When
you're dead' on Gemini is well worth listening to although 1
would recommend a good listen before buying it.
Many moons ago President took over V J records and
have at last got round to re-releasing old rock 'n' roll and
some good old soul (honest — it is good). Already out are
Sandy Nelson, Betty Everett and John Lee Hooker and a
various artist Album ('Rock V Roll Stars' JS5006) with
Ritchie Valens (La Bamba) Terry Stafford (Suspicion)
Bobby Day (Rockin' Robin) (etc., etc.) which is GOOD.
This CBS brought out a new Johnny Winter album and an
album by Skid Row which is B A D . They seem to take a
good riff and play it backwards just to make it sound wrong,
and on a couple of tracks they are definitely off tune. SO IF
Y O U L I K E S Y N C O P A T I O N — G E T IT! (otherwise forget
it, it really is abysmal).
Also out this month is another A l Kooper album 'Easy
does it' which keeps up the Kooper tradition of spoiling
some really good songs with nasty overpowering brass —
although as the originator of Rock brass with Blood Sweat
and Tears I suppose he has to put some in. Tim tells me
some of the lyrics are superb and although one track is sadly
marred by out of context backing voices (shades of Delaney
and Bonnie) most of it appears to be first class material.
CBS have also released one of the most magnificent
rural blues albums I have heard — Robert Johnson, King of
the Delta blues singers (CBS64102) this is a blues addicts
dream, but if you only like Rock blues forget it! This album
is the sort of foundation on which a whole sector of modern
blues, such as a lot of Cream and Stones material, has been
built; it is the second of two volumes containing all of Robert
Johnson's recorded material.
Finally, about the best of this month's new releases. On
Blue Horizon (S-7-63859) — K E Y L A R G O . A group of
very very together musicians playing music which, even if at
first unexciting, is quite faultless in its presentation. The
style is Blues. But this is blues incorporating the full range
by Chris Schofield
of blues styles from Otis Spann to earlier Canned Heat and
Blood Sweat and Tears; almost as if this is the product of
taking all post-war blues, throwing out the bad and the
pseudo, mixing up the rest with a fair sprinkling of Afro and
originality.
It's very difficult to review a sound you like and say
you like without sounding pseudo or stupid or both (particu-
larly for me, I'm told) so I'll just say Key Largo is varied,
interesting, and G O O D — I like it.
People who know my taste in music have asked 'Just be-
cause you recommend a record, how do we know we will
like it? ' Fair enough criticism I guess. So, if you want to
listen to any of the music we talk about then come to 577
Selkirk and listen to it, or go to any Disco around college
and find either Tim or Chris and if the mood is right, we'll
play it.
More about records next issue.
T I M A N D CHRIS
P.S. Been out a week or so — a single by Jimi Hendrix
with Voodoo Chile; Hey Joe; and Watchtower (Mastertracks
2095 001). 15 minutes of Hendrix for 6/- — A GOOD
THING.
