Yes to Apartheid
Dear Sir,
How wrong can someone
be, as wrong as Judith? It
would be difficult to go much
further.
The Apartheid Policy is
one, and probably the only,
way of saving this country
and the rest of the world
from total chaos. Admittedly
that is not very far away:
the coloured population is
different from the white pop-
ulation and such that the two
races are as incapable as
each other at integration, (in
fact they are like the Israeli
and Arabic nations in many
ways). Those who are differ-
ent should lead different
lives.
In general, though this of
course is not absolute for
everybody, the I.Q. of the
coloured population is lower
than the I.Q. of the white
population, (the nation with
the highest I.Q. is Israel).
Also the white man's brain
is better equipped to deal
with big business than that
of the black man, so why try
and force the wrong man
into a high position. On the
other hand where is the
white man's Clay (or A l i as
he prefers to be called), or
Satchmo, or any world class
sprinter, we have none, the
coloured p o p u l a t i o n
(Negro's) are much better.
Who can beat the Indians at
Hockey? I think they are
supreme, or the Japanese at
cheap electronic devices. No
one.
Each race is supreme at
something, but the biggest
rift comes when the colour
of their skin changes from
black to White or white to
black. With such a big dif-
What's O n ?

ference no sane, (black or
white) logical man or woman
could surely expect them to
live together without agita-
tion, and eventually even
worse. In the same way, the
lion and the zebra wiSll
migrate together, until the
lion is hungry then they are
deadly enemies. The black
and white live together until
the black realise they are not
so clever then—we all know.
Or the white man just hates
the black as there are quite
a number among them that
are spongers on society, (of
course, I realise that there
are white spongers also).
Another point, do I as-
sume correctly that Judith
never eats or drinks any of
South Africa's produces, or
refuses a bank cheque solely
because it's Barclays? — like
hell! Has she ever lived in
Barclays'
Adverts
I should like to make it
clear to anybody concerned
that all F E L I X advertising
(except for local ads. like
Lamley's and Haldane Lib-
rary) is obtained for us by
J.E.P. advertising agents.
Under the terms of our con-
tract we are obliged to ac-
cept any advertising they
give us. If we were to decide
not to include Barclays Bank
advertisements we would
probably lose our account
with J.E.P. thus losing an an-
nual income of about £1000.
As we are also not allowed
to get our own advertising
from outside the S.W.7. pos-
tal district, this would result
in the death of F E L I X . Per-
haps some people may think
this would be desirable but I
for one refuse to let F E L I X
pander to a minority of
xenophobes who cannot see
an indirect reference to South
Africa without quivering with
rage. Barclays adverts will
continue — you don't have
to read them if you don't
want to.

LOOK
Would you like to earn
some spare cash in College?
Mr. Mooney is looking for
people to help on the kitchen
and serving staff of the re-
fectories. Obviously the work
would be part-time only, but
the payment rates would be
the same as for his permanent
staff. This plea is completely
genuine.
the ghetto areas of London,
or any other city of Britain,
if so, I would like to hear of
her experiences.
NO V O T E
Finally I would like to say
that I feel that it would be
a good idea if we adopted a
slightly revised form of the
South African apartheid pol-
icy. Any person who is born
and bred in the British Isles
should have a first class cit-
izenship and any foreign per-
son coming to our country
to work should have a second
class citizenship, e.g. no vote,
no unemployment or child-
ren's benefits. Also any of
them may apply for first
class citizenship after five
years, if he, or she, has a
sufficient understanding of
politics, the race problem and
has a reasonable education,
and, any person who has
been in this country for over
nine months and wishes • to
return home, as he does not
like the country, would be
given a free passage for him-
self and his family if they
wish to go with him.

Editorial
Johnathon Moont originally conceived the idea of increasing
House/Hall rents. Reason for doing so are obvious — the
greater income means cash for the building of more student
accommodation.
Relatively speaking the most economical scheme is to
build a new hall of residence directly North of Linstead—in
fact a detailed estimate has already been made. The UGC has
stopped providing money for building new student residences,
but it will provide finance for the furnishing of such residences.
Note that at the time of completion, it cost £200 per room to
furnish S/S and £150 per room for Linstead. A rent increase
of ten shillings per week would mean that Northside, able
to accommodate about 200 students, could be built five years
from now.
Of course, money will come from other sources, it would
be unfair if the finance came from students alone. The College
also makes gentle probes into industrial concerns with accom-
modation plans in mind. At present hall rents do make a slight
profit and the halls have now accumulated quite a substantial
"float". The "Linstead hotel" scheme, perhaps expanded to
other halls, promises to be a valuable money spinner in the
future, and subletting of Student Houses last Summer brought
in £5000 clear. Another suggestion has been to absorb at
least part of the rent increases by lowering the cleaning stan-
dards in hall. I'm sure many students would prefer to do a
few chores themselves rather than pay an extra five to ten
shillings per week.
The point which needs making is that if students help
to finance halls, then they deserve to play a greater part in
running them. It's a point which still needs discussion—John
Sommers (Halls rep) lives in 617 Tiz. and welcomes all ideas
and suggestions.
Blindsight
Dear Sir,
Under the heading "Blind-
sight" in the last issue, the
writer makes false statements
about Moral Re-Armament,
which are totally unsubstan-
tiated. He states that it is
'rolling in money". We being
intimately involved in the
work of M R A and having
studied its published accounts
for the financial year 1968-
1969 know this is not true.
Perhaps the title of the arti-
cle is meant to refer to your
columnist.
We submit, therefore, that
if his reporting of financial
facts is unreliable, readers
should attach limited value
to his review of a stage pro-
duction.
As the article is unsigned
it presumably reflects edito-
rial opinion, so we request
the editors to withdraw the
statement.
May we also suggest that
readers see the play for them-
selves and form their own
judgement.
Yours faithfully,

Peace in
the Middle
East
Dear Sir,
On Tuesday night, 3rd
November, a joint meeting
took place between the In-
ternational Relations Club
and the Jewish Society on
the subject of "Approaches
to Peace in the Middle East".
As a result of this meeting,
we feel the need to write to
F E L I X to express our pro-
found disappointment at the
one-sidedness of the atten-
dance. Of the thirty people
present, no more than six
were from the I.R.C., the
remainder being Jews. The
only discussion Which took
place was between different
Pro-Zionist points of view.
It seems that in spite of
the useful and commendable
efforts of the committee of
the I.R.C. to bring together
two parties directly involved
in one of the most serious
present day problems of In-
ternational Relations, the
majority of its members
(who are nominally interest-
ed in international affairs
and world peace) did not
feel the problem important
enough to merit their parti-
cipation.
We wonder what real hope
there is of reaching a just
and peaceful settlement, if
those, who allegedly aspire
after this end, do not utilise
the opportunity which pre-
sents itself at a meeting of
this nature.
Yours in disillusionment,

Report
Dear Sir,
With reference to your re-
port of the I.C.U. meeting of
October 27th I would like to
point out two things.
Firstly your reporter made
absolutely no mention of the
first part of my motion con-
cerning refectories, which
was to my mind the most im-
portant. Briefly, this asked
for an enquiry to establish
exactly how the Refectory
Committee was given, in
June, an estimate for the
catering account deficit of
£10,000, when the true deficit
was in fact £28 — £30,000.
On this point the Union
has gained satisfaction from
the Rector, in that we shall
be able to raise the matter
at a meeting on refectories
which the Rector is holding
on November 27th.
Secondly, my name is
Graham Oubridge, not
George Oubridge.
Yours sincerely,
G. E . O U B R I D G E
