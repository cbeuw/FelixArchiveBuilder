MORPHY SPECIAL
FREE LATE S U P P L E M E N T TO FELQUH35S DO DOUBLEK 70.
Last Wednesday the annual college boat r a c e was
held on the Thames for the Morphy and Lowry cups,
and as was predicted Guilds confidently managed to
take both trophies.
The f i r s t race o f t h e afternoon v/as f o r the
Lowry cup run over a one rail© course. Both Guilds
and R.C.S. got off to a good start while Mines
rapidly f e l l behind and never looked like improving
their position. The race was very close between t h e
two leaders, Guilds taking t h e direct course and
risking the possible hazards to be found close to
the bank. Their gamble payed off and they managed
to p u l l ahead to win by two lengths over R.G.S.
The second race, for the Morphy Cup, was v e r y
much a one-sided a f f a i r . Guilds with several top
class oarsmen in their crew, were augmented b y a
masterly course taken by their hitherto unknown
cox to win by a very wide margin and so complete
the "double". The race f o r second place provided
great interest however as Mines and R.G.S. remained
Jjff very close throughout the course. At the halfway
r^f| 3tage of the one and three quarter mile course it
looked as i f Mines were t i r i n g but they produced
a superb effort at the end to snatch second place
Congratulations to a l l crews f o r an excellent
their well deserved victorya
