CAREERS
A l l of us have got to do
some sort of work in our lives
and for many in IC, the time
is rapidly approaching when
they must decide exactly
what. This refreshingly 'un-
speciailised' article on
careers by M r . E . Meacock,
was first published in F E L L X
last year. Remember no-one
can choose your career fop
you, they can only give you
ideas.
In one's early days, from
about five years to seven
years old, the favourite,
question — "and what do
you want to be when you
grow up?" could be, and
was usually, answered em-
phatically "Jet Pilot",
"Spaceman", and even "En-
gine driver" according to
the vogue at that particular
time. As one grew older
these childhood ambitions
dimmed until, in the majority
of cases, the mind became
perplexed by the increasing
knowledge of the world and
the activities of other men
and women.
The state o l vagueness
can, and does last until the
second, and even third year
at a university. This fact is
recognised and Appoint-
ments Boards exist, not
merely to act as employ-
ment bureaux, but to advise,
guide, and to help those
students who wish to take
advantage of the facilities
available.
A t Imperial College there
is a member of the academic
staff in each department who
is a member of the Sub Com-
mittee of the Appointments
Board. Any student first,
second or third year, or post-
graduate, can consult their
Careers
talks
Career opportunities talks
are held at 1.30 every Tues-
day and Thursday in the
Autumn term. They take
place in Lecture Theatre A ,
level 5, College Block (not
Lecture Theatre B as stated
in the relevant IC pamphlet).
Further information on the
subjects discussed and IC
Appointments Board is avail-
able from this pamphlet, in
turn available from Depart-
mental Representatives and
Mr. Meacock. M r . Meacock
is in Room 307, College
Block (int. 2740) and is ai-
rways willing to discuss
careers and suggest inter-
views. As an example the
subject of today's lecture is
"Careers in computing", and
Tuesday's is "Graduate op-
portunities in technical sales
and marketing."
making a choice
departmental representative
who will give as much
advice and assistance as
possible, but before consult-
ing him the students may
wish to explore for them-
selves some of the fields
which his or her studies are
opening up for them.
There are several publica-
tions which can be of great
help to a student who re-
quires career information.
Among these, and perhaps
one of the best, is the
"Directory of Opportunities
for Graduates" which is
published by Cornmarket
Careers Centre Ltd. This
book gives information
about a large number of
firms and organisations who
have an interest in recruit-
ing graduates, and reference
to this book will answer a
lot of those questions about
the firms which the student
will ask. Another publica-
tion on similar lines is the
Classic Publications Ltd.
"Professional Careers for
Graduate Scientists and
Engineers."
These books are excellent
in giving students ideas and
information concerning com-
panies, but they still do not
supply the whole answer to
your question "What do I
want to do?"
Most of the firms who
employ graduates issue
literature describing their
organisations, and the
various opportunities open
to the graduates who join
the company. Naturally this
is recruitment literature and
biased in the firms favour—
one would expect this, but
the literature provides part
of the information necessary
to help decide on the final
line of action.
Occasionally the course
suggested above does not
give the student the answer
and after going through the
books and brochures, and
taking his problems to the
departmental representative
that perplexity still remains
to some extent. There is yet
a further source of advice
open at the College.
The Imperial College
Appointments Board has
strong links with the Univer-
sity of London Appoint-
ments Board and we have
taken advantage of a com-
prehensive Careers Advisory
Service which the Univer-
sity Board provides. The
Service is operated by Field
Officers who are graduates
with a wide range of ex-
perience and a thorough
knowledge of most fields of
employment. A Field Officer
visits the College one day a
week during term and vaca-
tions to help students make
decisions about careers and
subsequently to help put
them in touch with suitable
bmployers. Students who
wish to see the Field Officer
should consult their depart-
mental representative first.
I have glibly talked of
the books and brochures but
have given no hint of how
to gain access to them. That
omission shall now be rec-
tified.
The College Appointments
Board have opened a publi-
cations Library on Level 3,
College Block, where all the
literature supplied by the
companies or connected with
careers is available.
So far I have dealt with
the student who, having
completed his course, selects
a career within his field of
study, but what of the
student who wishes to use
his degree in wider fields?
A good guide here is a pub-
lication issued by the
Careers Research and
Advisory Centre entitled
"Beyond a Degree" which
gives considerable help in
suggesting possibilities which
probably would not occur
to the student in this posi-
tion.
To such students my
advice is to consult the
above mentioned book,
which is available on appli-
cation to the" AppointmC: '•

possible plans with your
departmental representative
and, if he advises, the Field
Officer.

Careers again
Electric Folk
As part of their "Come
Together" series of events,
the Royal Court Theatre,
Sloane Square, presented on
Sunday, 25th, a concert fea-
turing Steeleye Span and
Fotheringay. Both of these
groups are splinter groups
from the Fairport Conven-
tion, and have kept basically
to that group's original con-
cept, i.e. to carry on the tra-
dition of English folk music
using electric instruments.
Steeleye Span, formed by
ex-Fairport man lyger
Hutchings and including
well-known folk-singer Mar-
tin Carthy, played first, with
girl vocalist Maddy Prior and
a backing of amplified violin
and guitars. Their act seemed
to me to be too loose and
uncordinated for a profes-
sional group, but included
one interesting item in the
form of an unaccompanied
version of an obscure Bob
Dylan song 'Lay down your
Weary Tune.'
After the customary road-
managers' interval, Fother-
ingay appeared, and immedi-
ately snowed themselves to
be a far more self-assured
band, held together by the
lively personalities of Trevor
Lucas and the amazing
Sandy Denny. Their material
varied from a solo unaccom-
janied "Lowlands of Hol-
land" from Sandy to a couple
of Australian bush-ranger
ballads sung by Trevor.
Notable also was Jerry Don-
ahue's rubber-fingered elec-
tric guitar work.
Both groups were handi-
capped to some extent by the
problems of setting up a P.A.
system on a small stage with-
out suffering from "feed-
back", particularly when the
audience is on both sides
of the stage. The concert was
certainly good value by
modern standards at 5/- for
a promenade ticket. 'Promen-
ade' at the Royal Court
means sitting on the floor
within yards of the stage.

YOUR OWN APPOINTMENTS SERVICE
by B. J. PRIGMORE,
Chairman, Imperial College Appointments Sub-Committee
You want advice, information and introductions to help
you to launch yourself on a suitable professional career: we,
who form the College Appointments Service, offer it to you.
Imperial College is unusual in that its first line advisory
service is offered by members of the academic staff of the
various departments, chartered engineers and professional
scientists in their own right, who have been entitled Depart-
mental Appointments Representatives. Since they know you,
and are themselves involved, often at the highest levels, in
the Professional Institutions associated with your hoped-for
Degree, they are in an excellent position to advise you about
the employment, and training for membership of your In-
stitution, which might best suit you personally.
INFORMATION
Associated with this advice is information: brochures
from appropriate employers are held in each Department,
and your Appointments Representative may direct your at-
tention to information of which you had hitherto been un-
aware.
Broader information is held in the Careers Library (Room
303, College Block).
You should anyhow skim the Directory of Appoint-
ments for Graduates and other relevant literature to give
yourself some background knowledge.
Maybe you feel yourself called to a career not closely
associated with your degree subject? If so, apply via your
Appointments Representative to see Mr. P. Ashworth or his
colleague, Mr. A . Wheatcroft, of the University of London
Careers Advisory Service. They come to Imperial College
every Wednesday, and have all the resources of ULCAS
behind them. Following their broad advice, aimed at guiding
you to make the best use of your characteristics, they can in-
troduce you to a phenomenal range of potential employers.
Don't hesitate to ask to see our U L C A S friends if you
feel they could help. First and second year, as well as final
year students, are especially invited to accept this offer on a
'friendly chat' basis.
OLD CENTRALIANS
Are you in Guilds? The Old Centralians' Counseling
Scheme is specially for you. Don't forget the Old Centralians'
Reception on Monday, 23rd November: useful introductions
can emerge from it.
After receiving advice and information, you will want
introductions: If an employer is coming to College in the
spring term, it saves time for all concerned that you should
then attend for a preliminary interview. To this end, use the
central organising service provided by Mr. A . G. E. Mea-
cock. Send him (via your Appointments Representative in
some Departments) your interview application forms early
in December. You will then receive appropriate brochures
and application forms well before the interviews. Don't for-
get to have read the brochures carefully before the inter-
views: it saves time on preliminaries and gives a good im-
pression.
If you are a post-graduate student you also have the
full service offered to you: ask for a set of careers papers
from your Representative.
So don't forget: if you want careers advice or informa-
tion, you have only to knock on the door of your Appoint-
ments Representative's office: we are at your service.
