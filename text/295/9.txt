Ist XI Lose Unbeaten Record
Wednesday saw I.C. beaten for the first time this season by Goldsmiths.
I.C. started well, against the wind, and proved to be much the superior side. C. Will-
cock putting them ahead after twenty minutes. However ten minutes before half time
right back P. Worthington, a vital man in I.C.'s defence had to leave the field due to an
ankle injury. Goldsmiths
seized this chance to get
back into the game, they at-
tacked down the vacant wing
and promptly scored. This
goal and Goldsmiths obvious
enthusiasm seemed to de-
stroy I.C.'s ten men, and for
the rest of the first half they
were under very heavy pres-
sure.
In the second half I.C. be-
came frantic in their efforts
to get the winner, this prov-
ed to be their undoing as
Goldsmiths seized the mid-
field vacated by Dinon and
Willcock and pushed for-
ward to add another three
goals with only one lucky
goal in reply from I.C. A
significant point in this game
was the unsettling of Darley
and Barnard by the two
boisterous front runners of
Goldsmiths. These two I.C.
men were pushed and shov-
ed unfairly when going for
the ball and receiving no help
from the referee were forc-
ed to give the opposition
their fair share of punish-
ment legal or illegal.
A disappointing game for
I.C. but with eleven fit men
I think it will take a good
side to beat them.
All out for winter eights
As the Boat Club settles
down to serious winter train-
ing all our efforts are direct-
ed towards winning trophies
at the University of London
Winter Eights Regatta, to be
held on 28th November. A t
this stage of the year much
mileage is covered in order
to weld the crews into effi-
cient units. However there is
no substitute for the experi-
ence gained from hard rac-
ing. Apart from the long-
distance Head of the River
Races in the Spring, there
are few competitive events to
aim for until the Summer.
We therefore take every op-
portunity seriously.
Morphy Day provides
another diversion. Constitu-
ent College rowing out-
wardly seems just as serious
but an air of festivity is ap-
parent to all those involved.
The Races for the Morphy
and Lowry Cups are rowed
between the constituent col-
lege first and second eights
respectively. They attract
many important College
personalities who tackle their
various pursuits with gay
abandon. The Boat Club
Dinner is held in the even-
ing and with many promi-
nent rowing personalities
present it provides even
more gay abandon.
In the midst of all this
activity, we are still accept-
ing new members at Putney,
Oarsmen of any status can
be accommodated and are
welcome. This year's begin-
ners look very promising
and are progressing well, but
we have room for more. In
particular we are looking for
lightweight, intelligent, out-
door types to act as coxes.
Any-one needing further in-
formation concerning the
Club should contact Dave
Sorton (67 Weeks Hall) or
'phone 788-4648 at any hour
of the day or night.
Cricket
Appeal
Every Sunday, during
henmtime, the cricket club
holds indoor winter net
practices at Cover's Cricket
School in Wandsworth. These
nets are basically to intro-
duce new members to the
club, as well as to provide
practice for the players. Any
member of I.C. who has not
joined the cricket club yet,
but would be interested in
playing during the summer,
should either give his name
to Russ Smith (Linstead 127)
or just come along on any
Sunday afternoon to the
lower lounge of the Union
at 3 p.m. (bringing just a pair
of plimsolls). No matter how
good or bad you are, we will
have a team catering for your
standard, so come along.
Lacrosse
I.C. vs. Lee 'B' Score 6-6
In the first round of the
flags knock-out tournament
Imperial College were drawn
home to Lee 'B'.
After an uncertain start,
we recovered to lead 3-2 at
the end of the second quar-
ter. Lee came back strongly
in the third quarter, and it
was mainly due to the good
plays of goalkeeper J. Kur-
kis that we held Lee to a
6-6 draw. Goalscorers were:
T. Smith (2), K . Noble (2),
B. Staples and P. Drury. Re-
play Sunday 15th November
at Orpington
New members always wel-
come, no experience neces-
sary. Contact Lacrosse Club

tead 418.
B a d m i n t o n
Last week saw the begin-
ning of I.C.'s badminton
season.
With the promotion of the
3rd team, we have introduc-
ed a 4th men's team in the
fourth division. The 2nd
men's team secured their
place in div. 2 and will do
as well (we hope better) this
season. The mixed came 2nd
last season due to unsport-
ing-goings-on in Colleges
which will remain nameless.
This year there is N O
D O U B T IC W I L L W I N
T H E M I X E D along with
Muhammed A l i killing Joe
Frazier. The ladies too (let's
not forget them) have start-
ed off brilliantly this season
by thrashing Kings 9-0.
Last year B.U.S.F. ladies
singles and men's doubles
were won by Lynn Beynon
(Chem. Ill) S. K . Donald
(Maths P.G.) and G. A .
Georgiou (Maths II) respec-
tively.
Naturally they have been
selected this year to defend
their titles along with Sue
Thompson (Maths II) who
has been selected as a re-
serve for the Ladies Doubles.
The Championships will
be held at Crystal Palace Re-
creation Ground on 27-28
November.
Other results: — Men's I
beat Q.M.C. 9-0, beat R.H.C.
7-2. Men's II beat L.S.E.
5-4. Men's III beat Q.M.C.
5-4. beat F. Ham. 5-4.
Men's
Hockey
U.L. Cup: Q.E.C. 0
I.C. lst XI 4
This was the first cup
match this season and I.C.
are successfully through to
the next round. Most of the
play took place in the
Q.E.C. goalmouth, but it
was not until just before
half-time that Dave Richman
put I.C. ahead. In the second
half, Richman scored ano-
ther two (by various devious
means) and Ian Tasney
made it four shortly before
time.
I.C. lst XI 2
London Hospital 1
I.C. 1st XI 2
Chalfont St. Peter 0
Both these games were
played with I.C. having only
10 men. Dave Richman
(wonder-boy!) kept up the
good work by scoring both
goals against London Hospi-
tal.
Record: P. 8; W. 7; D. 0;
L. 1; Goals for 20; Against
5.
On Sunday, 8th November
I.C. fielded a strong team in
the annual U . L . six-a-side
tournament. Our first match
was against U.C. and prov-
ed to be our hardest, the win-
ning goal coming in the final
minute. Goldsmiths and
'Royal Free Hospital were
beaten 3-0 and 2-0 respec
lively and with 6 points out
of 6, I.C. headed their
group.
In the quarter finals, a
goal by Richman was suffi-
cient to beat Bedford and
against St. Thomas' Hospi-
tal in the semi-final, we
drew 1-1, losing however by
2 short corners to 1. St.
Thomas' went on to over-
whelm Guys in the final 5-0
and win the tournament for
the fourth year running.
It was thus a great per-
formance for I.C. who last
year failed to win a game.
Team from: A . Forbes, S.
Tyrrell, M . Field, J. Sargent,
M . Tatchell, D. Wilson, D.
Richman.
E D I T O R I A L
As followers of sport at I.C. read this page they will
have realised that most of the major sporting events of the
Autumn Term have either passed or are very close at hand.
The soccer, hockey and rugby have all played their lst
rounds in their respective University cups—the results of
which are dotted about this page (and Felicity). Morphy
Day has passed by for yet another college year as this largely
preparative term draws to a close.
However two important events need special mention. As
explained in more detail elsewhere on this page the B.U.S.F.
badminton championships are near at hand and it is im-
portant to realise just what a good standard some people at
college maintain in their own sport—this is particularly true
of badminton and also swimming. It is also true of middle
and long distance running, some national champions having
emerged from I.C. last year—go along to the Hyde Park
Relay organised by the Cross Country Clubs and realise the
wealth of talent abounding at I.C. (Also, in this case, con-
siderable organisational talent).
In conclusion, I must report the successful evening last
week when members of the sportsmen's club of I.C. gathered
to listen and discuss their various sports in a convivial atmos-
phere. Wherever different types of people integrate and learn
—it must be good, even if it is called Sports Club.

The defence has been very
solid with one or two players
outstanding, particularly Mar-

I.C. 2nd XI 0, Chalfont St.

Fielding an inexperienced
side I.C. had further trouble
when their captain, John An-
drews, went off with a hand
injury. The opposition were
more ait home on the all
weather pitch but fine goal-
keeping by Andy Paine bol-
stered 'the frail defence. By
the second half the I.C. play-
ers became accustomed to the
surface and they were un-
lucky not to score at least
once.
Late Result. I.C. lst X I 1, Southampton Univ. 0.
I.C. put points on L.S.E.
I.C. 19pts. L.S.E. 6 pts.
With the first round of the
Gutteridge Cup Match only
a week away, both the team
as a whole wanted to im-
press—and also certain
members fighting for their
cup place. However, al-
though the game started well,
the rugby standard deterior-
ated steadily. This was due
solely to the behaviour of
the referee whose strange de-
cisions both baffled and irri-
tated both sides.
I.C. were 8-nil up after
some 10 minutes due to 2
tries by wingforward Mike
Adams both coming fiVim
good combined loose play
by the forwards. Dennis
Brownlee converted one.
L.S.E. pulled back to 8-6
pts. after kicking two of the
numerous penalty chances
they were offered; this was
the score at a very wet and
thoroughly uninspiring half
time.
I.C. attempted to forget
about the ref in the 2nd half
and play constructive rugby.
This paid off and continuous
pressure saw Nick Jeely go
over from a five yard
scrum. Brownlee converted.
After good running by the
backs, winger Phil Lofts
went over for a try in his
first game for the lst X V .
L.S.E.—with 2 men off due
to bad ankle injuries—really
cracked badly and a crush-
ing run by prop George
Widelski saw full back Dick
Pudney go over.
A reasonable performance
by I.C.—a particularly good
debut by fresher Alan James
at fly half, in wet and slip-
pery conditions. After two
consecutive defeats at the
hands of U.C. and Bedford
Wanderers (2nd X V ) a win
good for morale of which
plenty will be needed on
Wednesday 18th against
Chelsea.
Team: R. Pudney, P.
Lofts, D. Brownlee, K . Con-
olly (Capt.), R. Anderson,
A . James, D. Hill, G . Wid-
elski, P. Earl, B . Holling-
worth, S. Owens, R. Mat-
thews, J. Cunk, N . Icely, M.
Adams.
P.S.—At Wasps clubhouse
at Sudbury last week, where
both Coventry lst team
(beat Wasps lst X V 25-nil)
and I.C. Exton lst (beat
Wasps 3rd X V 17-12) were
playing, it was said that in
the field of singing (both dit-
ty and otherwise) I.C. emerg-
ed clear and undisputed win-
ners!
