Manager's Bit
It's been a fun week running between
telephones and fax machines all i n the
cause of interesting news and lots of gory
gossip. Unfortunately w e are not able to
bring you half the stuff this week but I
am sure you will find something good to
read a week o n Wednesday.
Chrimbo Edition
What! A week o n Wednesday, how can
that be you say. Well, for the uninitiated
at the end of term w e try and finish with
a bit of a bang. This means that w e will
be running a huge issue packed with lots
of goodies for y o u to read and play! Yes
we have a board game for passing b y
those awful bits of Christmas.
If you want to get anything into the
next issue you will have to come and see
me as soon as possible. W e will also need
lots of collators to help us put the issue
together and drink lots of wine, beer etc
and eat mince pies and things. If you can
help out turn up o n M o n d a y evening
from about 6 p m and Tuesday evening
from 7pm onwards. Remember that's not
next week but the one after.
Two is a special number
On Monday and Tuesday there are two
very important things happening and you
ought to be a part of it. Rolled into one
convenient m o v e you will b e able to vote
for or against the all new Non-Sabbatical
Felix Editor and make your opinion
k n o w n about the possible changes to the
College Day. This is a biggie as the
College working party o n the idea meets
on Thursday to decide what to do. If a
big enough number of people give their
views then this must be taken into
account b y the working party if they are
living o n the same planet as us. Of course
this may not be the case. Because of the
two matters above there is a big
possibility of a FELIX flysheet going out
on Wednesday morning so keep a look
out for this next week.
