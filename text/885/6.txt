Cosi Fan Tutti
It is easy to see w h y the Royal
Opera House is facing a massive
deficit while the E N O (nearly)
manages to balance its books. The E N O
has not abandoned innovation entirely,
but obviously has a policy of staging a
number of 'popular' operas each season
which will guarantee near capacity
audiences. A d d to this the fact that many
of these are revivals, which are cheaper
than new productions, and it becomes
clear w h y they aren't blackmailing the
Arts Council into giving them larger and
Just So
To walk into the Tricycle theatre is
akin to stepping through a
wardrobe into Narnia. It is a
thespian oasis stuck in the heart of post
holocaust Kilburn.
The auditorium itself c a n only be
described as Meccano for adults. R e d
scaffolding climbs to the ceiling and
across the balcony. The stage is a
continuation of this superstructure thus
making it split-level and utilising all the
space that a cosy 'back r o o m ' can offer.
Just So (so it says) is a musical inspired
by the stories of Rudyard Kipling. Its
creators, George Stiles and A n t h o n y
Drewe, were the first winners of the
Vivian Ellis prize for y o u n g writers.
The cast have been in everything from
Zulu through to Countdown v i a Les
Miserables. O K so n o w y o u know the
background let's get d o w n to the biz.
There's a farting, belching, 18 stone,
North Yorkshire Rhino w h o would put
Compo to shame. There's a giraffe with
great legs and an amazing pair of
baps...on her bum!! There's a Kolokolo
bird w h o you'd want to take home to
mother and a Dingo w h o you'd want to
take home to the mother-in-law. There's a
Kangaroo w h o should be world 'gurning'
champion, such are his facial expressions.
There's a dancing marijuana plant, honest
guv, and all this from a children's book!
The set and costumes seem to have
been sponsored by Platex because of the
profusion of corsets, girdles and the like
(hence the giraffe's appendages).
The songs are excellent, with a hint of
larger subsidies.
Such a production is this Cosi. A revival
dating from 1980, it is a 'nice' opera. A
lighthearted comedy, conventionally
staged, it is not going to frighten the
casual opera-going public in the w a y that,
say, Wozzeck or Dr Faust might.
Having said that, it is actually not a bad
production. The set, whilst versatile in
depicting both inside and outside, lacks
any real innovation or depth of thought,
but is an inoffensive background to the
performers. It is well sung, especially by
Elizabeth Gale as Despina (to be replaced
by Lesley Garrett from 12th December).
The plot, concerning the testing of the
fidelity of two sisters by their soldier
fiances, is easy to follow, if a little slow-
moving and failing to seize all the
opportunities to play up the farcical
elements.
In short, a good w o r k m a n l i k e
production. Its worth going to see if y o u
don't k n o w m u c h about an opera, but it's
not going to scare anyone, least of all the
ENO's bank manager.
Liz W
Gilbert and Sullivan (don't let this put y o u
off). The lyrics are both solacious and
corny with references to lost cherries and
short and curlies through to Rudyard
Kipling making exceedingly good cakes.
Forget pantos. Forget Rice and Lloyd
Webber. See this N O W . Brilliant.
P.S. I k n o w m y grammers crap but she
died five years ago.
Unbaggy.

18 years ago Nancy Aglet had a
demon (with a particularly silly
voice) exorcised by Father Mayii
(Leslie Nielson). Then, while watching a
T V evangelist show, her head spins round
to spray her husband with chick-pea
soup. 'Bet its P M T ' , whispers one smart-
arsed kid, but no—she's been
Repossessed\ Nancy (Linda Blair, Oscar
winner for the first Exorcist—what a
coincidence^)) seeks the help of Father
Luke Brophy, and persuades him to seek
authorisation for a poodle...sorry,
exorcism. T h e exorcism is approved, but
on the condition that it appears on
'Earnest and Fanny's E x o r c i s m tonight'—
the self same show that Nancy was
watching w h e n she was Repossessed!
A n d so starts a hilarious comedy from
the mould of Airplane and The Naked
Gun. Hang o n a minute there, the only
c o m m o n link between the films
mentioned above is M r Nielson, where
are the producers Abrahams and Zucker?
The fact has to be faced that this m a y be
in the style of the aforementioned
movies, 'tis not from the same stable.
Does this matter? A little, as somewhere
along the line the edge of pure humour is
lost, and occasionally this effort slips into
mere silliness. F o r the most part, though,
this is a damn fine movie.
There are the visual gags w e have
come to expect, and they hit us with such
frequency that y o u are sure that y o u miss
some of them along the w a y , as some of
them are difficult to spot, like Nancy's car
numberplate 666 GIRL. T h e verbal
humour is rooted deeply i n today's T V
and film culture, from Star Wars (May the
Faith be with you, Luke) to the Rocky
films. The unfortunate locker room
sequence is straight out of a Carry On
movie and best forgotten. The priests
make fools of themselves, the world's
religious leaders get a chase scene, the
poodle (yes, there is one) gets minced and
the Devil gets all the best lines.
Not quite up to Naked Gun standard
(worry not, Naked Gun 2'A is coming) but
probably the funniest movie released in a
while.
