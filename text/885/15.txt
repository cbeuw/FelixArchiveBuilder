Dear Sir,
I feel compelled to write o n the subject
of your apparently fictional series of
letters.
'The Adventures of the Inadequate
Man', a selection of rantings from a
fictional character 'Alan Bailey'.
Firstly it is only fair to tell y o u that a
real 'Alan Bailey' exists, a n d as 1 gaze at
him now, I find it hard to believe that
your bigoted, and some might say pig
ignorant charactor can be based on this
beautiful human being.
Furthermore h o w could the author of
your entertaining but hard hitting series
of 'Mock Misives' be believed to be an
Imperial College student. This is a college
of higher education, and some say the
heart of the late sixties 'peace and love'
generationâ€”the pieces so far have been
suffering and to try to tell ourselves
nothing can be done about it, when w e
really want to help. Here in the so-called
'Free West' people have little choice h o w
to live their lives. T h e system we live
under is so abominable, we should not
congratulate ourselves w h e n outsiders
admire it. Their choice of what to believe
and what to fight for, and our choice,
ought not to be restricted to alternative
forms of opression.
Yours sincerely,
Jason Pike.
illiterate, biased to the point of racist or
homophobic hysteria, and no doubt
written originally in shakey writing.
Imperial College would not, 1 feel sure,
produce such a miserable specimen; from
its atmosphere of understanding and
enlightenment, such a self-important
intollerant shithead seems unlikely. T h e
mythical persona of 'Alan Bailey' is not at
a College of higher education, but clearly
a wanker of the highest order w h o has
never been o n a cheap d a y return to the
planet Earth.
If you intend to publish any more of M r
Bailey's opinions, perhaps they could be
tainted with a bit of beauty; as it is, if
they were to be taken seriously, they
could offend, upset, and do a lot of
damage.

Dear Chris,
First thing: the cover of issue 883
promised that students would soon have
the amazing opportunity to pay tuition
fees, in addition to living costs. No more
of this soppy Thatcherite ideology
whereby the poor taxpayers subsidise us
to lounge about for three years and then
get a fabbo job. I've been looking forward
to this for ages, and eagerly scoured your
mighty publication for details. T o m y
dismay there was no mention of what I'm
sure would be a staggeringly popular
scheme. It n o w seems to me that this was
a cruel hoax, designed to increase
FELIX's circulation with empty promises
of wondrous delights. Be warned, this can
only lose you readers in the long run.
The best w a y to shift more copies is the
Murdoch-Maxwell theorem, i.e. enormous
eye-catching headlines, million pound
bingo, and loads of nude bimbos.
The other thing: Athena is doing an
excellent job, generating interest in
FELIX. His criticism of the Saddam
Hussein F a n Club on campus is entirely
justified. 1 am surprised, however, that he
didn't condemn in more forthright terms
El-Choly's bigoted rantings of a fortnight
ago. Britian has a long and fascinating
history, and a culture envied and
emulated the world over. A s a Briton
(well, almost) I consider Amin's remarks
more offensive than anything Athena has
said. Keep it up A t h , and h o w about
solving the Northern Ireland problem
next?
Yours anti-Heseltinely,
