Dear Sir,
I would like to suggest that Imperial
College Union and all its members do not
in any way get involved in a campaign
that would support taking human life and
particularly abortion.
Firstly, the human embryo and foetus is
an individual from conception. F r o m this
point o n (s)he has a unique D N A structure
and grows according to its o w n biological
set up. A s an individual the embryo or
foetus should be given the rights of any
human especially and foremostly the right
to live. W o m e n do have rights but, like
men, these rights do not include
termination of innocent human life o n
demand. This attitude is o n e of pure
selfishness and thinking only of one's o w n
comfort and convenience. It is
unfortunate that there is so little concern
for the innocent and helpless i n the world
today.
Secondly, God created man after His
own image and to abuse that is an
abomination of his holy sight. W e are to
have the same concern for other
individuals as w e have for our o w n
bodies. The Bible puts it this way, 'Love
the Lord your G o d with all your heart
and with all your soul and with all your
mind'. This is the first and greatest
commandment. A n d the second is like it,
'Love your neighbour as yourself.' B y the
w o r d 'neighbour', Christ means all
mankind, the fact that w e have such a
low view of other people's welfare is
another mark of the way sin has bondage
over this world. It is sin that separates us
from the perfect and holy God and as all
have sinned, all deserve the just
What's O n
penaltyâ€”death alone. However, praise
God that H e has not left us in this
hopeless state but presented His Son,
Jesus Christ, as the only sufficient
sacrifice to pay for sin, so that,
'whosoever believes in H i m will not
perish but will have eternal life'. (John
3:16).
Even though, Christ has paid the
penalty for the sin of the elect, w e all
have the responsibility to seek to follow
the moral law which teaches us to think
of others before ourselves. It is in this
spirit that I urge the IC Women's Officer
not to encourage the availability of

Dear Chris,
It is a bit hard to k n o w where to start,
have never heard so much drivel in all
my life, that is since Konrad Pagenstert's
letter. The 3 critics (Felix 884) obviously
never read m y letter properly.
I will start with Darren Austin's letter:
Well I don't need to look up 'bigoted,
xenophobic o r sycophant,' however you
better look u p 'intolerance' since you
spelt it with 2 l's. I don't revel in war. I
respect and admire those who gave their
lives so the rest of us might enjoy the
freedom that w e all have. The reason
why I kept m y arguement fixed on
Japanese attrocities was simply because
m y letter was attacking Prince Charles'
visit to Japan. There was no point in
mentioning South Africa since the Prince
wasn't even going to the same continent.
abortion in this country, n o r protest at a
perfectly just l a w i n another nation. M a y
we all divert our attention to preserving
God's creation to His glory. W e pray that
this country would turn from the sin that
has been committed 'legally' over the
past 23 years to accordance with the
perfect W o r d of G o d i n H o l y Scripture.
For the advancement of God's glory,

I do agree that part of Rememberance-
day, however, is to remember the horrors
of war.
Moving o n to Dominic Jenkin:
A l l I can say about this person is that
he must be a closet Nazi since he wanted
obviously, to appease Hitler. What is most
disgraceful about him are his comments
and I quote 'I will not respect those that
died...' Well, if those people had not
stopped Hitler b y being prepared to kill
others, you would k n o w b e living under
the Nazi flag, with no Royal Family and
no parliament. W h y don't you shut up
and hold your white feather.
Finally Matthew Salter:
Well, this was just a load of toffee-
nosed condescending drivel. I a m glad he
is grateful to those who died for our
freedoms. They were heroes because they
