Manifesto
UNION
Andy Butcher Non Sabbatical FELIX Editor
Proposed by James Briant
Manifestoes are always tough to write (it's
tough enough to spell for a start). Phrases
like '1 think y o u should vote for me
because...' and 'If elected I promise to...'
come sneaking unbidden to your mind,
furtively gathering at the edges of your
conciousness. Y o u drop your guard for a
second and A R R G G G H H H H ! ! ! You've
written the biggest electoral cliche since
'Vote for me or the goose gets it'! Your
originality, self esteem, a n d credibility go
out on strike, your sanity starts to
crumble and it's all over... Y o u ' v e written
another 300 boring words and no one
reads past the third line!
So, I'm not going to tell y o u to 'vote for
me'. Honest. I'm just going to say w h y I
want to do the job. Radical, eh?
It's not going to be very long, either.
The simple fact is I want to do it because
I'll enjoy it.
Well, maybe it shouldn't be that short.
In m y d i m and murky past (the Vlth year)
I produced a newsletter. In m y 1st year I
ressurected the Tizard hall paper, the
Lizard. This year I've been w o r k i n g for
Felix. A l l these have been great fun, and
I loved doing them. If I get the post, m y
main aims will be to continue (and with
any luck, improve) the excellent work
done by Chris so far and to make Felix
as entertaining as possible.
To sum it all up, I honestly enjoy
staying up 'til all hours of the morning,
living on coffee and cigarettes, being
under constant stress, writing very long
sentences, having members of staff avoid
me, and having huge amounts of work to
do. The w a y I see it being Felix Editor
isn't going to stop me doing any of that.
A n d y Butcher.
H o w to Vote
In a valiant attempt to join in the current vogue of internal
elections Imperial College Union is having an election for a
non-sabbatical F E L I X Editor. The poll is on M o n d a y and
Tuesday from 10am to 5pm. Voting will definitely take place
in the Mech E n g Foyer, JCR, Union Snack Bar, M a t h s / D o C
W a l k w a y Concourse, C h e m E n g Concourse and the Mines
Entrance as well as at Silwood and St Mary's. Voting m a y take
place in other departments depending on h o w many people
want to m a n ballot boxes (you do get payed!).
At College w e use a method of voting somewhat different to
the Tory Party, i.e. the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system.
S T V is reliant on a candidate achieving greater than 50% of
all votes. This is achieved b y the following method:
Y o u award a 1 (solely a 1 not a tick or X or a n y other
smudge) to the candidate who, in your opinion, is best. Y o u
can stop there or award a 2 to the next best candidate, 3 to
the next and so on depending o n h o w many candidates there
are, including N e w Election.
There are a few parts to remember otherwise y o u will void
your paper. There can only be numbers on the paper, they
must start at 1, they must be sequenced and not represent an
equal preference.
O n the paper there is a choice marked N e w Election. If y o u
vote 1 for this option y o u make a statement that the candidate
is unsuitable for the job. If y o u want to vote N e w Election fine,
but do not do it as a joke as an election costs a substantial

amount of money to run (hence w e are running a referendum
at the same time).
The counting of votes will be at 5.30pm on Tuesday. A
candidate must pass quota, which is one vote more than 50%
of valid papers being counted. S T V gets more complicated
when more than one candidate stands as votes are transferred
but y o u will have to wait until then.
