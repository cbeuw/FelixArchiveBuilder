Dear FELIX,
First of all, I would like to thank y o u
very much for publishing articles by Chris
Riley on China. A t the time w h e n the
West are celebrating the liberation of
Eastern Europe and the end of the Cold
War, the Chinese cause is sadly being
largely forgotten. Chris Riley has rightly
presented an in-depth study and a first-
hand experience i n China. It is of great
value to the international community at
IC and in particular to Chinese students
who are anxious to obtain any
information about their home country.
However, through a letter by Jason
Pike, I found pure neivety and utter
ignorance. History seems to be distorted
in Pike's hand and everything has to
show blood i n his red eyes. Most of the
Chinese students at IC have stood up
from the Cultural Revolution and involved
themselves in the ten years of reform to
some extent, It was only from the
understanding that Cultural Revolution
has nearly destroyed China and
Communism is not w o r k i n g have w e been
determined to rebuild China for a fairer,
freer and more democratic society.
During the time of the Nationalist
government of China, the question was
how m u c h liberty m a y be allowed.
However, with the Communist
government w h e n everything is under
party control, the question becomes
whether w e have liberty o r not.
Intellectuals have been purged again and
again. Workers are under strict political
discipline (not w o r k i n g discipline) and if
anything happens, they are the first to be
used or to be punished. The worst
happens in the countryside where there is
What's O n
no social welfare system—the trademark
of socialism—at all and yet more than
80% of the population live there. The
peasants provide the state with cheap
food and every n o w and then millions die
of starvation due to mismanagement.
Jason Pike needs to be reminded that
he is free to publish his letter here or in
the future free China but should the w o r d
'capitalism' in his final paragraph be
replaced by 'communism' as follows:
By giving some people power over
others, the state created the opportunity

Dear FELIX,
The writer of one of your articles
'Tiananmen: Riot or Massacre' chose
interviewees w i t h a sadly patronising
attitude towards the ordinary people of
their country. W h o e v e r said that pressure
for political democracy is right for
Eastern Europe but not China because
'People in Eastern European countries
have better democratic minds than the
Chinese people', was effectively saying
that he or she thought the Chinese people
don't have the right to determine their
own future because they are too stupid or
too ignorant to agree with h i m or her.
The admiration expressed for the
influence of capitalist countries, is
misplaced. A r e not Taiwan a n d South
Korea capitalist countries? There, the
exploitation of the w o r k i n g class is more
severe than i n Western Europe because
the State has more power to enforce it.
Some people call the market-directed
for personal corruption. The state, low
wages and high prices are necessary to
create the profits that communism (the
exploitation of people by a parasitic
ruling elite) demands. But communism is
not necessary.
Then most people m a y find more truth
in it and he would have to spend a few
good years in jail if the letter were made
public in a, however small, circle in
China.
Yours sincerely,
Ming Ri.
form of capitalism 'economic freedom' or
'the free market'. But it does not provide
freedom for people of any class. Just to
survive and maintain our position, w e all
have to fulfil the demands of the market,
and many people are pressurised to
quench the caring side of their nature to
compete. Since our economic and political
environment inevitably determine the
range of choices available to us, humanity
will not be free until w e control politics
and the economy. In the Soviet Union,
where the people are striving to sieze
political power, so the economy is being
taken out of political control and into
private ownership by the ruling class.
This process is a threat to all potential
new democracies; people should insist o n
the right to r u n their o w n workplace
(circumventing the State w h i c h is
cumbersome and corrupt).

democracies' is looking at them through
