Mud-Wrestling Extravaganza
A sunny day it was that
dawned to see me scrabbling
north on this country's famous
rail network to one of the most
bleak and desolate parts of
England; to the very heart of
the North: Bolton.
I was here to observe that
fantastic new sport that is
sweeping nation after nation,
catching all who experience it
in an upswell of enthusiasm,
like a veritable brown tsunami.
I speak of none other, of course,
than the famous 2002 M u d -
Wrestling-Slow-Down-Mow-
Round-Ho-Down Grand Finals.
Last year's winner was there
to defend her title, but the for-
mat of this year's bouts took a
different format from previous
ones. I can tell you that last
year was a distressingly Non-
Politically Correct affair, with
different divisions for each sex.
Of course that kind of old fash-
ioned out-moded thinking was
right out at this year's event,
and the foolish complaints of
many that 'Girls aren't as
strong as boys' was bitterly
ignored, and quite rightly so.
This sport isn't about mere
strength: this is a game that
can be played on a mental level
as well as utilising speed,
courage, and a vicious desire to
expose your enemy's genitals..
The rules are complex, and
can't be explained in detail
here, but it's fair to say that the
first person who finds them-
selves butt-naked up to their
neck in mud lost. Imagine, if
you will, a lovechild of rugby,
wrestling and strip poker.
A Personal Plea
As you may have noticed by
this point, the sports section
this week consists solely two
articles concerning yachting. I
know that this will seem less
than fair to some of you, but I
would like to point out - so I
don't get too much abuse from
those of you who are not fans
of the nautical arts - that there
was nothing else to publish.
This is not a complaint
directed at the ICYS, to whom
I am indeed most grateful, but
at the rest of you bastards
who didn't send us anything
at all. I know that the summer
term is a busy and stressful
time for us all but it's also a
time for some of the finer
pleasures i n life: cricket, and,
er, swimming, and all that
kind of stuff.
So get out there and play
frisbee, you lovely people. Get
out there, enjoy the sun, and
then come back and write me
some 'we're enjoying the sun'
reports, and I can have a
whole new section that entire-
ly relates your lazy afternoons
sat i n the park w i t h your
friends rather than revising.
Which is great. Let me repeat
myself once more: there's
more to life than a degree, you
know. Like sunburn.
So as this, possibly the
weirdest issue of Felix ever
published, draws to an end, it
merely remains for me to fill
up the rather large empty half-
page above my head. To do
this, I'll tell you about my
enjoyable time at a certain
rapidly growing sport's finals.
Suffice to say I won't men-
tion the bizarre incident with
the goat, the lightning and the
small kitchen utensil used for
crushing garlic, but the goat is
happily living in Brighton with
the utensil, and I'm off to have
a nervous breakdown.
This year's first bout (sorry,
but I just can't resist this) was
between Doug 'Pretty Filthy,
Really' Williams (seeded 4) and
Mary 'Slightly Soiled' Dane (6),
which passed relatively
uneventfully, apart from some
slightly suspect play from Mary
that seemed to suggest a swift
kick between Doug's legs.
However, never one to give up,
he came back to eventually pin
her down and claim victory.
The next three first round
matches all went as expected,
with the higher seeds all win-
ning their matches. This led to
Doug 'Really Quite Filthy, Now'
Williams (4) being up against
Ali 'Nasty Mucky Threesome'
Tehran (3), and current champi-
on Penny 'Dirty Filthy Dirty
Dirty Little Vixen' Monsoon (1)
was to play Fryn 'Could Be
M u c h Dirtier, But Is
Nonetheless Pretty Manky'
Farrer (5).
After much to-ing and fro-
ing, Fryn beat Penny using a
surprise headlock, and went on
to face Ali, who had overcome
Doug using his patent 'Four
Footer' Manoeuvre.
This final match lasted sev-
eral hours, and both players
looked like they enjoyed every
moment, but all good things
must eventually climax, and
once the mire had cleared, it
was found that A l i was up to
his neck in it, leaving Fryn 'We
Knew She Had It In Her To Be A
Really Really Dirty Little
Deviant' Farrer as the winner.
Rest assured: I will keep you
informed of future games...
