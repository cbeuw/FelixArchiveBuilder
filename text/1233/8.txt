this week
Editorial
Well, boys and girls. What an
eventful time it's been for your
friendly neighbourhood editor.
Would you like a full rundown
on the happy events that have
led to my mental downfall? Of
course you wouldn't, but as
usual, I have nothing better to
write about, and I've felt less
bitter in the past, and quite
frankly, what's the point of
editing a student newspaper
if you can't exploit it in such a
way as to perform self analy-
sis, and achieve some kind of
cathartic closure, resulting
finally in issue resolution and
a positive personality out-
come? Eh?
So, first you may have
noticed that Felix is tiny. This,
I'm afraid, will probably be an
ongoing problem throughout
the rest of this term, since w e
have no money. I have been
reliably informed that this is
due to the tragic events of
September 11th, which has
led to a record low in graduate
recruitment, a n d thus the
advertising on w h i c h I
depend that funds this august
organ. Basically we're out of
cash, so I'm cutting back.
Not to mention the fact that
nobody ever wants to help
during the summer term, due
either to exam revision,
exams, or the fact that they've
finished their exams and are
therefore sitting i n a hole
somewhere, surrounded b y
their own excrement and evi-
dence of a significant amount
of drug abuse. W h i c h is
always my favourite option.
To be honest, given half a
chance, I wouldn't be here
either, but then I'm paid, so I
suppose I should do some-
thing to justify that.
So that's one thing. The
next thing I have to talk about
is more personal, but then I've
never been one to shirk from
exposing myself i n public
(giggle). You see the problem
is holidays. I made the foolish
error of going away for a
whole eight days, and I have
now learned that that is sig-
nificantly longer than the
attention span of certain peo-
ple who shall remain name-
less because while I'm bitter
I'm not a complete bastard.
Well I am, but not like that.
Anyway the upshot is that
w h e n I went away I w a s
happy and had a girlfriend,
and w h e n I returned I was
unhappy and did not. This
doesn't sound too complex,
but it wasn't actually my girl-
friend w h o h a d the short
attention span, she was mere-
ly the unfortunate injury in an
emotional crossfire I couldn't
keep together. (Sorry.)
So that's a fairly cryptic ref-
erence, and I realise that you
all think I'm probably very
silly, but you wouldn't believe
how relieving it is to publicly
air your sorrows. I hope I
haven't made myself out to be
some unfortunate soul who
has been trampled on,
because that's not true. I sus-
pect I deserve everything I
get, but I'm still allowed to
feel sorry for myself, so rasp-
berries to you.
Anyway, on a more cheerful
note, it's summer, so at last I
can go out and look like a tit
trying to play frisbee, not to
mention wandering around
subtly enjoying the lovely
skirts that people (girls, usu-
ally) start to wear this time of
year. A n d I don't have to do
nasty things like exams, so
that's a bonus too.
Good luck, however, to all of
you who are sitting them this
term. However, as I've said
before, you're going to work
for the rest of your life, but
you're only a student once.

That is a good gag, isn't
it. Well it made me
laugh. Ummm... swash-

because they didn't have
zips in those days.
K-Pax
I can't believe anyone's
in this film. It just
sounds like utter tripe to
me, but then I haven't
seen it, so what do I
know. He's from another
planet, or something.

Ooh, foreign, and there-

Very clever. I'm really
impressed. I am hereby

because they've got an
overly clever name.
