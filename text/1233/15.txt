Yacht Club Misadventures
It all got off to a bad start. It
was the weekend of the yacht
clubs annual mad dash across
to Cherbourg and back again.
The plan w a s to leave
London early Friday afternoon,
leave Portsmouth around nine
that evening, get to Cherbourg
for a late breakfast on Saturday,
go to the hypermarket and pub
and then leave on Saturday
evening to be back i n
Portsmouth on Sunday after-
noon. Sadly this was not to be.
What with leaving London over
an hour late, the mini bus
breaking down and not buying
quick cook pasta for dinner w e
didn't leave until midnight.
Having left the lights of
Portsmouth Harbour behind
we found that the wind w a s
not in a direction suitable for
just pointing at France a n d
hoping w e got there, and a
more zigzagged approach was
recruired.
We started on a westerly
tack a n d stormed along at
about seven knots for a few
hours, three of the ten crew on
watch a n d the others fast
asleep, apart from the skipper
who had chosen to sleep next
to the chocolate and was there-
fore frequently disturbed by
members of the watch. Three
hours later the first watch went
to bed and the next took over.
Unfortunately at some point in
the next three hours the wind
also decided to change and it
became clear that w e wouldn't
get to Cherbourg until dinner
time on Saturday, which would
leave us with only a couple of
hours there before the long trip
home. It was therefore decided
at a very sleepy six i n the
morning that w e wouldn't
bother, and instead w e contin-
ued on our circumnavigation of
the Isle of Wight, heading for
Poole which w e reached nine
hours and a fine cooked break-
fast later.
We stayed in Poole just long
enough to shower and go to
the pub, and then headed for
along the coast to Lymington.
The trip out of Poole harbour
was an exciting hour of spot-
ting flashing lights and match-
ing them to those on the chart,
a task somewhat complicated
by a random cardinal buoy, and
the difficulty of distmg^shing
between a light flashing every
four seconds and one that
flashed every five.
We arrived i n Lymington at
half past midnight, with the
intention of leaving again at 5
am, however, for reasons that
are unclear, this didn't happen.
Instead w e left at half past
eight and went the short w a y
along the coast, reaching
record speeds of over ten knots
and finding ourselves outside
Portsmouth Harbour very much
ahead of schedule for the first
time all weekend. So w e found
ourselves a quiet spot a n d
threw a buoy called John over-
board until he w a s rescued
after spending hours i n the
freezing water and losing both
legs. We then headed to the
Isle of Wight for lunch and a
quick drink before heading
back to Portsmouth to hand
back the boat, having had a
fantastic weekends sailing
even if everything hadn't gone
to plan....
In slightly more serious
Yachting news, over the final
weekend of last term a Yacht
Club crew, out to prove that
they weren't quite as incom-
petent as the first half of this
article suggests, enjoyed an
eventful t w o days of one-
design racing i n the Solent.
The company organising the
regatta has recently pur-
chased a fleet of brand n e w
Sunfast 37s and so w e had the
pleasure of racing a boat that
had only been sailed once
before.
Conditions for the weekend
were forecast to be excellent
for racing w i t h calm seas,
good visibility a n d moderate
winds. Despite the fine
weather and the new boat w e
soon encountered a problem.
During a downwind run short-
ly before the start of the race a
shackle broke, dumping our
spinnaker i n the water and
sending its halyard to the top
of the mast. Quickly w e recov-
ered the sail from the sea and
hoisted a willing volunteer up
the mast to retrieve the hal-
yard, completing the task i n
time for the start. After a rea-
sonable start w e worked our
way up the fleet of 23 other
yachts and, despite a close
encounter w i t h the London
Business School boat, finished
a respectable 11th. Following
a long lunch break, for repairs
to be made to other yachts,
the second race went ahead
with no problems and w e fin-
ished 10th. Encouraged by the
days performance w e
returned to Portsmouth a n d
hurried to the pub for food and
beer.
Sunday's weather w a s bet-
ter still, as w a s our perform-
ance. During the first race of
the day some superb team-
work and crafty tactics meant
we crossed the line i n a very
pleasing 6th position. With
this encouragement the final
race of the weekend started
superbly putting us in the top
five for most of the race.
Unfortunately as the saying
goes it isn't finished until the
fat lady sings and the saying
couldn't be truer for sailing
and w e finished the race i n
7th position.
