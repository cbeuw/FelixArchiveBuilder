College Security Guard Knifed
Last monday, i n the Blackett Laboratory,
home to the Physics department, a secu-
rity guard was attacked, seemingly with-
out any real motive, by a man wielding a
knife.
It should be noted that this is the first
serious attack on a member of college
security in over a decade, with the only
incidents being a few minor scuffles at
various freshers fairs.
The man attempted to enter the build-
ing, and w a s immediately challenged by
Tom Gamble, a member of the Blackett
security team. O n being challenged the
man produced a blade, and M r Gamble
was only able to prevent a potentially
lethal blow to his throat by blocking the
blade with his right hand, which was
badly damaged in the incident.
When further members of college secu-
rity arrived the man w a s wrestled to the
ground and swiftly disarmed, and it is
alleged that he proceeded to spray those
present with some sort of chemical. The
police and fire brigade were then called
in, and after investigation the chemical
Physics Department: Scene of the Attack
was found to be surgical spirit.
After the assailant had been subdued,
he claimed to be i n possession of an
explosive device, and the Bomb Squad
rapidly joined the assembled representa-
tives of the local emergency services.
This also necessitated the repeated clo-
sure of Prince Consort Road and much of
the surrounding area during the day.
The man was apparently asking for a
particular senior member of staff i n the
Physics department, a n d while the
attacker is not thought to be a member of
College itself, he is alleged to have
described himself as 'a Physicist'.
Mr Gamble is recovering well from his
attack, and was discharged from hospital
fairly quickly after being admitted for his
injuries, although he is awaiting surgery
on his hand. Meanwhile the assailant
awaits trial in custody.
In other security news, there have been
a number of thefts committed i n Evelyn
Gardens by a n individual w h o is
described as being very tall, having
dreadlocks, and being of afro-caribbean
origin: anyone seeing him is advised by
security to call the police immediately.

My editorial, which will possibly f
explain why this issue is so small, ^ ^
and why I'm in a strange enough
mood to pretend that the cat is dead.
Oh deary me, Will has finally lost it..
