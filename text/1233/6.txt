Ayes right!
Will,
After a lot of coverage by Felix
over the last f e w months
regarding the ICU/NUS refer-
endum, I feel there was a need
to reply to a couple of the
points made.
To start with, on a positive
note, the "victory" in the refer-
endum does not lie with either
the "Yes" or "No" campaigns.
The fact that over 28% of the
full membership of the Union
voted sends a clear, uncompli-
cated message to College that
we are an active Union. We are
a Union that takes part, that
has debate, that is political
(small "p") if you will. This can
only bode well for the future.
Secondly, I would like to
respond to a few of the letters
your paper received. It w a s
always my intention to invite
non-Imperial people to this
debate, and I make no qualms
about it. The campaign of the
"Yes" team was always one of
education. T h e students I
spoke to knew nothing about
the NUS. They had many many
questions regarding the
National Union, including
"Why is it that every other
University in the country bar
one is a member, even though
they a l l hold referendums
every 3 years?", "What are the
benefits" and a whole stack
along the lines of "Is it true
that..." The only w a y these
questions could be answered
was through experience.
Experience of dealing with the
NUS. Hence I invited people
who were a) London-centric
and b) experienced in dealing
w i t h the National Union.
People who attended included
the U L U President, U L U Vice
Presidents', a large proportion
of the U L U Exec as well as offi-
cers from Kings College, U C L
and Thames Valley. The feed-
back obtained from those stu-
dents who actually stopped to
speak to these people w a s
very positive. If I was to re-run
the campaign, I would do
exactly the same thing again,
as I believe it to be in the best
interests of the students here.
Thirdly, I would like to thank
all those that took part i n the
"Yes" campaign. Much fun was
had, talking to people, rebuff-
ing lies, designing websites
(www.nusatimperial.co.uk).
From what I can gather, there
are still a lot of people asking
questions. Asking what I C U
does for them. Asking h o w
much of the £900,000 a year
they see of the money that
College gives ICU. A s k i n g
why they don't get discounts.
Asking when the next referen-
dum will be. To those people, I
urge you to keep asking. A s k
until you get an answer that
you're happy with; not one
that will rob you of a vote for
another seven years.
Thanks,
David Francis,
Chairman, Campaign for Re-
affiliation to the NUS

What part of 'No' does David
Francis not understand?
(Imperial rejects NUS, 20
March 2002).

Letters aren't usually edited
for spelling and grammar, but
often for length - keeping them
to the style of Mr Heeps' con-
tribution certainly helps. AW

The people speak
Dear Felix,
Why has no one done anything
about the little gimps from the
NUS that have decided to
invade College and are annoy-
ing and misleading our stu-
dents? They have no right to
be here, t h e referendum
should be for students to
decide upon for themselves,
without external influence by
people who have nothing to do
with College. They have also
been telling people that beer
will be cheaper if w e join the
NUS. If the reports in Felix are
true (saying that beer will go
up in price by 10-15p per pint
w i t h the NUS), then they
appear to be spreading lies.
On top of this, they seem to be
quite offensive little self-
important people, w h o don't
actually have any answers to
questions such as what the
NUS h a s ever achieved.
Unfortunately, it is too late to
do anything about them, but
hopefully, no one has listened
to the yellow shirted prats and
their little bits of yellow paper.
Sid, Aero
Just to be clear, Felix did not
say that beer prices would def-
initely go up - we merely com-
pared prices with another
University of London bar,
where beer was more expen-
sive. As to whether anybody
paid attention to the NUS dele-
gates, it appears they didn't.

Hello,
I just went to South Ken to see
the doc and picked up a copy
of Felix while I was there. The
Easter E g g thing looks very
comprehensive, and I suspect
that you'll want to publish
this, as I am a ranting post-
