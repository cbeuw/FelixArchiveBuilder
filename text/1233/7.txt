back talk
grad and you don't get much
publishable mail.
Oh, and why have you
stopped sending Felix to
Hammersmith? It's one of the
few good things to read
around here.
I'd like to say that the election,
and referendum, were a farce.
I was not sent an e-mail telling
me of the referendum, like I
heard other students were,
therefore I didn't get to
appoint a proxy in time, as the
times of proxy allocation were
not communicated to me and
therefore didn't vote in either.
Bit crap really.
So, the issues are:
Why do medics only have one
ballot box? Who decided this?
Why is there a serious commu-
nication problem with getting
info to students located at
campuses other than South
Ken? Who should pay for this?
I know that it is too late for the
election, or referendum to be
re-run (I am personally quite
happy with the result thank
you) - but for next year, some-
thing should be done about
this.

We're glad you liked the Easter
Egg review. As for deliveries of
Felix to Hammersmith, we do
send copies on Friday every
week, so they should arrive by
Monday. If they appear to be
going astray, we shall certainly
follow it up. AW
Hi Will,
Now I'm no political expert,
and I'm writing on Thursday
morning, when the polls have
just opened, so I've no sub-
stantial evidence to go on,
only my judgement. But I'd like
to raise a point: What does it
say about the state of our
Union, and the IC student
body in general w h e n we
struggle to have a 10% turnout
for an election, but we flock to
the polls to vote on the
NUS??? Having spoken to peo-
ple and obseved the queues at
the ballot boxes, I'm expecting
a previously unheard-of ridicu-
lously high turnout for this
vote by IC standards. The rea-
son - people actually care and
want to express an opinion.
Be it student discounts or club
funding (seemingly the only
arguments for and against) we
have a view.
So why don't we care about
who doles out the funding??
I'd hazard its because we don't
notice any changes from one
year to another, we don't
know the candidates (so who
knows what job they will do)
and so none of us care.
Is every Uni as apathetic as
we are? Why do we care so
much about a card? A n d why
couldn't the sabbs sort out
two votes on the same day?
Answers on a postcard..?

Dear Felix,
We thought it was important
that our customers read the
following letter from the
Metropolitan Police.
Yours,
Mick (Union Bars Manager)
The purpose of this letter is to
inform you of the Metropolitan
Police strategy towards deal-
ing with drunkenness in and
around licensed premises in
Westminster.
There are Government statis-
tics to show that there is a sig-
nificant correlation between
persons who are drunk and
gon on to commit crime or
become victims of crime.
The city of Westminster is one
of the most popular areas for
visitors and for Londoners to
enjoy a night out. However it
must be acknowledged that
people do get drunk and cause
problems for residents and
other visitors to the area.
The Licensing Act 1964 makes
it quite clear that permitting
drunkenness, serving a drunk,
or allowing a drunk to remain
on licensed premises is an
offence.
With these points in mind it is
felt that positive action needs
to be taken to deal with drunk-
enness and the issues arising
from drunkenness. A s such
the Metropolitan Police in con-
junction with the Portman
Group and the British Institute
of Innkeepers intend to launch
an anti drunkenness strategy.
The purpose of this partner-
ship is to provide awareness
for drinkers, a proactive police
enforcement regime, and an
education programme for
licensees and their staff. We
feel that this holistic approach
is the most appropriate
method for dealing with a bur-
geoning problem in London.
Within the next few weeks
there will be a police enforce-
ment programme aimed at
dealing with drunkenness in
licensed premises.
We hope that you will join us
in tackling the problem of
drunkenness and making
Westminster a safer and more
enjoyable environment for its
residents and visitors.
Yours faithfully,
Christopher Bradford
Chief Inspector
