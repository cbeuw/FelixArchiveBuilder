Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
...cont
just goes along every
week, and knows what
to expect. A n d that's
cheese. And, as I said,
maybe some house,
trance, etc, playing ear-
lier for those who like it.
Trivia
You know what this is,
and if you don't, then
there is no reason at all
for going, because you
won't win, because
you're stupid. Bleh!

They used to be cheesy,
and now they're not. No-
one has told me whether
this means less cheese,
but I feel it's safe to say
that's unlikely...
Union, Le Soir
Goat Juggling
Baaaaaaah. Maaaaaaah.
Meep. Blu. Hang on,
that's a puffin, what's it
doing here? Hello, little
Puffin. Blu!. That's the
noise that puffins make.

Dolly Mixtures
Hmmm... This is going
to make my diary even
more boring, with the
same thing every week.
It was going to be called
All Sortz, you know.
Union, Blah blah blah...

Blade II
It is actually physically
impossible to make a
better film than this. It
has Wesley Snipes in it,
and he goes round bitch
-slapping evil vampires.
What more do you need?
Taxi II
Not at the movies, but
you could get it on
video. Sequel to Luc
Besson's Taxi. Well I
liked it, but that may
have been the company
I was keeping.
Beautiful M i n d
Arse, more like.
Somehow I'm already
bored of Russel Crowe.
A n d why does he have
to keep pretending not
to be Australian? Is he
ashamed, maybe?
24 Hour Party People
Steve Coogan imitates
some 80's pop heroes
that most of you will
think are tragically
unhip, but to whom I
have a curious, yet
slightly sinister, affinity.
Blade Runner
This is only on at a cine-
ma in Hastings, but
frankly it's so good that
you should all go down
there right now in a
coach and watch it a
thousand times.

Wibbly noise type peo-
ple who will wibble for
your aural delectation,
probably while you trip
out of your tiny little
mind, if you want.

I'm afraid it's quite likely
that their music is
dodgy. I suspect they
spend more time think-
ing up names than prac-
tising, and this is bad.
Monarch
A n d You Will Know Us...
These guys rock, even if
they do have a slightly
long winded name.
Which they do. Okay,
you've got them, I know
they're a band, that's it.
The Forum
Alec Empire
Even less of an idea who
this is, but he's playing
the Mean Fiddler, so
he's go to be reasonable.
After all, it's a hip and
groovy place.

Clinic
I've heard of them, and
by the name, I would
imagine they are cer-
tainly angry about
something. Insurance
premiums, perhaps?
