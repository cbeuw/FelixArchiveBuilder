Could interest rate cuts be our remedy for COVID-19?
Japan and cost a total of
$2.7 trillion in lost pro-
duction (equal to the GDP
of the UK).
According to estimates,
China is witnessing a
record low GDP growth
of 1.2% year on year.
If the trajectory of the
outbreak continues in the
current direction – the
economic situation will
almost certainly worsen
further. Global Central
Banks have been quick to
react to the increasing risk
to the major economic
powers. On the 3rd of
March, the US Federal
Reserve shocked the
markets by cutting its
main policy rates by 50
basis points. This was the
first emergency rate cut
after the financial crisis
in 2008. Other banks
followed suit with the
Bank of Canada reducing
the rate from 1.75% to
1.25%. Both the Reserve
Bank of Australia and the
Bank Negara Malaysia
reduced their benchmark
rates by 25 basis points
to 0.5% and 2.5% re-
spectively. The Bank of
England (BoE) has just
announced a 0.5% rate cut
on the Wednesday (11th
of March). It is important
to note that for some
central banks interest rate
cuts are not feasible – the
Eurozone and Japan
already have negative
rates. Further reductions
could be destructive to
banks – in a negative
interest rates environ-
ment, banks have to pay
out of their pocket for the
loans they hold. In other
words, this gives banks
an incentive to not give
credit. Negative rate cuts
also discourage savers
from keeping money in
banks, which again is bad
for the banking system.
Provided that interest
rate remains positive,
interest rate cuts normally
stimulate the economy
– people are more likely
to borrow at lower rates
and invest the money.
However, the recent
interest rate cuts failed
to combat the economic
impact of COVID-19.

The key here is the fact
that the root of economic
problems from the
outbreak is not inherently
financial, but rather psy-
chological. An increasing
number of people world-
wide are getting anxious
about travelling or visiting
shops and restaurants in
fear of contracting the
virus. Interest rate cuts are
highly unlikely to solve
the problem of plum-
meting global consumer
confidence and demand
deficit.
It cannot be a solution
to the supply problem
either – the supply chains
all over the world have
been disrupted as a result
of travel bans, restrictions
and quarantines. Many
economists argue that
the decision to cut the
rate in fear of recession
was rushed and could
potentially harm the US
economy.
According to key
metrics, the US economy
was not in a vulnerable
position before the
outbreak and even the
economic shock follow-
ing the outbreak was
unlikely to trigger reces-
sion. Interestingly, the US
- China trade war could
have buffered the global
supply disruption – the
tariffs on China-produced
goods caused several
manufacturers to move
production out of China.
While in theory interest
rate cuts are good for
markets, on this occasion,
investor reaction was the
opposite. Following the
Fed cut, yields on long-
term 10-year US Treasury
bonds have plummeted to
the record low of under
1%. This in turn led to
narrowing of the gap
between the 10-year and
2-year bonds, which is
considered to be a sign
of an upcoming recession.
As experts argue, the US
economy was not particu-
larly susceptible to reces-
sion before, but the recent
rate cut could have pushed
the economy to ‘Japanifi-
cation’ – a concept used
to describe stagnated
economic growth and
repeating cycles of reces-
sion in Japan even with
negative interest rates.
All of this begs the
question – could rate
cuts be the solution to
the economic shock?
South Korea, one of the
most seriously affected
by COVID-19 countries,
seems to have taken
another route. Instead of
stimulating the markets
by rate cuts, they decided
to provide administrative
and fiscal support to
smaller business to keep
them going, as well as
to provide childcare
subsidies. Experts world-

wide are anticipating
further global easing as
the outbreak progresses.
Andrew Bailey, who is due
to become BoE governor
on the 16th of March said
that the central bank will
swiftly respond to prevent
economic shock from the
virus. Therefore, the 0.5%
cut to British interest rates
did not catch the investors
by surprise. The central
bank also highlighted
that further actions might
be taken if required. As
the situation with the
COVID-19 outbreak
develops rapidly, experts
argue that BoE will
have to take additional
measures sooner than later
to combat the economic
fallout as UK economic
growth in January failed
to meet predictions.
and led to major travel
disruption all over the
globe. Unsurprisingly, the
financial markets have
been quick to reflect the
growing concerns of in-
vestors worldwide of this
volatile situation.
The rapid spread of
the epidemic around
the globe has severely
affected the global
economic powers such
as China, South Korea,
Italy and Iran. As the
trajectory of the outbreak
is highly unpredictable,
the worldwide damage
can only be estimated.
