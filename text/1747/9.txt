Jason Robert Brown,
The Last Five Years is a
window into the lives of
Jamie (Oli Higginson)
and Cathy (Molly Lynch);
following their relation-
ship of five years, from
the moment it starts, to the
moment it ends.
Almost entirely sung-
through, the couple take
turns to tell their story.
Jamie tells the story in
chronological order, while
Cathy starts from the
moment it ends, moving
backwards with each
song. The interspersed
narratives converge in
the middle, giving the
show it’s only duet in the
process.
In the beginning of
their relationship, Cathy
is a struggling actress
while Jamie is a hopeful
writer. By the end, Jamie
has found success with his
writing, whereas Cathy is
still struggling. Although
this contributes to the
strain in their relationship,
the problems are far
deeper. The 90 minute run
is well utilized to explore
the nuances of this
fragmented relationship
without assigning blame,
resulting in a well-bal-
anced exploration into
how things can change
slowly yet irreparably in
life.
Both Higginson
and Lynch are brilliant
vocalists who carry the
songs that are the living
“In some ways,
it is incredibly
Sondheim-
esque, with
smartly placed
call-backs and
references
to earlier
moments
within the
show...”
“The limited
stage size
makes the
show feel
a little too
karaoke at
times”
proof of Brown’s musical
genius. In fact, this pro-
duction does wonders to
remind musical theatre
enthusiasts that The Last
Five Years, despite its
simple premise and a
mere cast size of two, is
probably one of the most
exceptionally written,
most cohesive musicals in
recent times. Brown’s way
of using the same lyrics
and melodies in different
songs in a way that has the
exact opposite meaning is
truly astonishing and his
use of chords and patterns
in the accompaniment is
superb. In some ways, it is
incredibly Sondheim-es-
que, with smartly placed
call-backs and references
to earlier moments within
the show, with just enough
variation to demonstrate
the changing stakes and
the strain on the relation-
ship.
Even within a single
song, for example, ‘See
I’m Smiling’, Brown’s
writing was able to tactful-
ly capture the characters’
wide range of emotions.
Other highlights include
the songs ‘If I Didn’t
Believe in You’ and ‘Still
Hurting’, perhaps the
two most widely known
songs from the musical.
The lyrics in these songs
were hard hitting, delving
deep into the characters’
psyche, allowing for a
complex analyses of who
these people are in their
core. The show is not all
too serious though, and
has its fair share of hilar-
ious moments. Thanks to
the smart use of everyday
objects as props, and songs
such as ‘The Schmuel
Song’ which cut through
serious moments, the
show manages to capture
the comedic element of
musicals while addressing
intense themes, without
going overboard with
either.
Directed by Jonathan
O’Boyle, the staging is
simple, with a grand piano
on the small Southwark
Playhouse stage. As one
of the characters sings,
the other plays along at
the piano. In an interview,
Lynch describes the piano
as almost having a charac-
ter of its own. This comes
across quite vividly in
this production thanks to
Brown’s gorgeous score.
Unfortunately, having one
of the two actors play the
piano through the pro-
duction limits the amount
of interaction the two
characters could possibly
have.
The limited stage size
makes the show feel a
little too karaoke at times.
However, this works at
times in the show’s favour,
as it allows the actors to
directly tell their story to
the audience while also
singing to each other..
However, the presence of
a grand piano on the tiny
stage definitely restricts
the performers’ range of
movement, perhaps exac-
erbating the lack of chem-
istry between Higginson
and Lynch, which made
it all the more difficult to
sell to the audience why
they’d be in love enough
to get married in the first
place. However, this
mild lack of chemistry
works excellently in
the moments where the
couple are going through
a rough patch or are on
the verge of breaking
up. Additionally, despite
the revolving stage and
the in-the-round set up,
Higginson and Lynch
spend a tad too long with
their backs turned to the
entire audience, a feat
hard to achieve given the
stage set up. However, the
one aspect of the staging
which works marvellous-
ly well is the lighting,
which shifts from warm
pinks and yellows to cold
whites and blues as the re-
lationship turns sour. This
not only helps explore the
emotional turbulence that
the characters are experi-
encing, but also makes it
easier for the audience to
keep track of the changing
timelines.
This new production of
TheLastFiveYearsproves
once again why Brown is
one of the most esteemed
musical theatre writers of
this century. Higginson
and Lynch more than
hold their own against
the music, ensuring that
the production is fun and
gut-wrenching all at once.
