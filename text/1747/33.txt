We also found an interesting snippet that shows that even in this
time, only around 10% of the College’s students were women.
1980s The 80s ﬁnds contained a bit more
controversy - women at the College
were frustrated with sexist articles
that again painted them in
a sexual light.
However, it also
again represented
the growing wave
of women’s issues
groups at the College,
and the promotion
of those via Felix
- although often
there was a negative
pall cast over them,
by others or even
by themselves. In
particular, we saw
the women of WIST
discarding the term
‘feminist’ as akin or
identical to being
‘militant’ - showing
that there was still a
long way to go.
Enjoy this section? We hope to continue diving into
the archives to explore Felix and the College’s history
with social issues. Get in touch and let us know your
thoughts and if you’d like to be involved!
