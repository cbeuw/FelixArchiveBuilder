the 7th March
2020, Imperial
Students Henry
Hart and Matt Ryan rep-
resented Great Britain’s
age-group teams in Punta
Umbria, Spain for the
ETU European Duathlon
Championships 2020.
Having qualified for
this event at Bedford Au-
todrome in March 2019
battling 40 mph winds,
rain and temperatures just
above zero, to be travel-
ling out to the beach resort
town of Punta Umbria in
South-West Spain was a
pleasant contrast
The race was a familiar
sprint distance format, a
4.8km run, followed by a
20.4km draft-legal cycle
and finally an additional
2.8km run to the finish
line. Competing against
the rest of Europe’s
age-groupers, aged 16 to
85 and almost 500 athletes
entered for the Sprint
distance race.
Henry and Matt were
both racing in the first
wave, consisting of all the
16-19, 20-24 and 25-29
year old males– this was
the firm favourite for an
overall champion. At
0900, the competitors
were lined up and ready to
strike. With hundreds of
supporters lining the route
from all over Europe,
waving national flags, the
tension was palpable.
With a blast of the
start horn, the athletes
rushed down the starting
funnel, only for disaster
to strike less than 4 strides
into the race. Another
GB athlete tripped in the
fight for positions and
went down to the ground
causing a pileup of around
6 athletes, which Hart
managed to jump straight
over. Unfortunately for
Ryan, he did not react
in time, and went down
along with a few Spanish
athletes and an Irish repre-
sentative, hitting his right
knee hard on the tarmac
before picking himself
back up at the rear of the
pack.
Henry assumed his
position at the front of the
race. As Cross-Country
club captain, and out-
standing runner, this was
exactly what he wanted.
Completing the first
4.8km in 14 minutes and
48 seconds, finishing at
the head of the race with
the second fastest run time
of the whole competition;
all without using those
pesky Vaporflys that keep
popping up in races.
Matt initially struggling
with the freshly sustained
injury pushed on until
adrenaline and hate began
to mask the pain, fighting
through the pack to finish
in 15 minutes and 56
seconds.
On to the bike, where
Henry quickly found his
place amongst the two
other strongest runners
and settled into a routine
of taking turns on the front
with the pair of Spaniards
to maintain their lead.
Meanwhile, Matt (feeling
more comfortable in Mul-
tisport events than running
races) blitzed through
transition to catch up
with previous age-group
champion and fellow Brit
– David Pearson. Matt
and Pearson working with
Felix Wernham formed a
three-man, British cycling
machine to push through
the sea of Spanish, Irish
and Portuguese athletes
between them and the
front pack. These three
Brits working in unison
taking turns on point
produced the fastest bike
time of the whole compe-
tition, completing 20.4km
in 29:48, gaining almost
45 seconds on the leaders,
landing Matt in 4th at
the end of the bike, with
Henry still in 1st place
upon leaving T2.
This left only the
final 2.8km run to go,
where Henry could again
unleash his full potential
as a runner, and finish the
whole race in 55 minutes
and 12 seconds, scoring
3rd overall in Europe,
winner of the 20-24
category, and fastest Brit
at the event. Crossing the
finish line Henry hardly
seemed elated, perhaps
distracted by the thought
of a finish line beer.
Matt meanwhile began
the second run with some
difficulty, as his knee had
begun to swell from the
earlier injury. During this
final leg, Ryan dropped
back from 4th overall in
Europe to 6th in the 20-24
age group.
Henry Hart’s debut at
a Multisport Champion-
ship could not have gone
better, landing him the
potential to race alongside
giants such as Brownlee
and Potter in next year’s
elite race. A monumental
effort in anyone’s books,
let alone somebody who
professes to despise
cycling. Meanwhile Matt,
with a knee now double
its initial size and an array
of strange colours, also
felt the need to celebrate
with vast quantities of
alcohol, and boy did we,
or so we’ve been told
by the rest of Team GB
who witnessed it… Spain
was too hot for clothes
anyway.
