One Jewish Boy!
I
t is always challeng-
ing to construct a two
person play address-
ing social issues. In
such cases there is a very
fine line between organic
exploration of intense
themes and a unilateral
exposition of arguments
by the characters; and
it is quite easy to foray
into the latter territory
unintentionally. Thus, it is
particularly charming to
find a play that manages
to achieve this quite won-
derfully, with a carefully
balanced critique of com-
plex social themes, which
in this case is inherited
trauma and anti-semitism.
Stephen Laughton’s
One Jewish Boy, is a play
exploring the domestic
and personal consequenc-
es of anti-semitism in
society (both overt and
subtle); It does this by
transporting us into the
world of Jesse (Robert
Neumark-Jones) and Alex
(Asha Reid). Jesse is a
north London Jewish boy
who is forever traumatised
by the relentless anti-sem-
itism he has faced over the
years and is unable to look
at the world optimistical-
ly. Alex on the other hand
is mixed race, and though
having faced her fair share
of racism over the years,
struggles to understand
Jesse’s unique anguish.
Through these two
characters Laughton
within a span of 90
minutes, manages to craft
narratives that address
well beyond the conven-
tional tropes of anti-sem-
itism, addressing racism,
white privilege, religious
politics and identity crisis.
The play follows a
non-linear structure of
storytelling, starting off
with modern day Alex and
Jesse who are considering
divorce. From there on the
play moves in between
the years reflecting on
the different moments of
conflict in their lives, and
how anti-semitism and
the subtle baggage that it
brings are chief contrib-
utors to this. One of the
key highlights of the play
is how it craftily manages
to capture character
flaws, particularly on how
victims of racism may
subconsciously be racist
themselves.
No where else is this
dichotomy better pre-
sented than in Jesse who
constantly seeks to define
the world around him
based on his experiences.
Jesse’s call to be seen
as more than a Jewish
person is immediately
contrasted by this behav-
iour to judge all around,
wilfully painting people
in broad and sometimes
racist strokes. Alex com-
plements this by taking
a more objective view
of the events and offers
a middling perspective
reflecting at times perhaps
the audiences view. In
this way the exchanges
between the characters
seem real, and translate to
honest discussion, rather
than reflecting the writers/
directors opinions.
The non-linear nar-
rative structure helped
greatly in unfolding key
moments without reveal-
ing the suspense in the
story. However the segues
between these acts seemed
indulgent and at times.
incoherent. Reid and Neu-
mark-Jones give honest
and convincing perfor-
mances. The minimalist
set design works well
within this production but
one is left wondering how
well the script might have
worked had it received the
full treatment.
Racism is a vicious
beast, one that is uniquely
difficult to articulate
and communicate. It’s
commendable that the
play with its limited cast
manages to achieve this in
a non-trivial manner. It’s
definitely worth a watch;
or two - particularly if
you are one of those
that believe that modern
racism is harmless.
Can I Help You?
C
an I Help You?
tells the story
of a night in the
lives of Francis
and Fifi. The play starts
with Francis, a police of-
ficer, standing at Beachy
Head after work about to
commit suicide when he
meets a Ghanian woman
named Fifi with a cat in a
box and a laundry bag.
Jim Pope brilliantly
brings to life Philip
Osment’s last play,
standing out mostly for
the contrast between its
humorous and emotional
scenes. The humour
mainly comes from the
clash of Fifi’s positive,
nonsensical attitude with
Francis’s cynical outlook.
There are also many
ridiculous elements such
as the cat named Kat or
Fifi’s continuous inter-
ruptions to feed the cop.
The emotional scenes are
more abundant during
the flashbacks, showing
the toughest moments of
a suffering mother and a
wounded son.
The set design is
minimal. It consists of a
slope and the two actors
only have a few essential
props. This comes in
useful with the flashbacks
as the audience doesn’t
associate the stage with
a particular setting. The
slope represents multiple
places including Beachy
Head both now and in the
past, the house Francis
used to live in, the airport
and more. With less to
process visually, the play
draws the audience’s
attention to the dialogues,
acting and sound effects.
The acting is outstand-
ing. Ganriel Vick and
SusanAderin both manage
to play multiple roles
distinctly. Vick mainly
plays Francis and Michel,
Fifi’s Son, and Aderin
plays Fifi and Fiona,
Michel’s Mother. The
instantaneous changes in
their attitudes and voice
is exceptional, taking us
to different scenarios and
times in their lives in a
very effortless way.
Ultimately, ‘Can I Help
You?’ is the story of two
hurt individuals who meet
each other by pure chance
and find hope together. A
wonderful play to recall
the importance of support
and remind us that
however different we may
be, we can always relate
and be understanding
with others.
