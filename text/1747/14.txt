Freedom Hi
F
reedom Hi is an
immersive and
highly playful
devised compila-
tion, showcasing a range
of visceral, sometimes
autobiographical pieces
that reﬂect on Hong
Kong’s ongoing move-
ment. As kaleidoscopes of
commentary celebrating
instances of performance,
organisation and activism,
it blurs the potentialities
of each. The set is kitted
out in protest symbols:
LIHKG Pig and Dog
masks, banners, water
bottles, and cardboard.
Audience members are
asked to join a custom
Telegram group during the
show. The artists (many
of whom are real-life
activists) and most of the
creative team are Hong
Kongers and/or British
East Asian. The “fear”
and “uncertainty” of
transforming work in local
and diasporic theatres of
resistance, into theatre
in resistance, is openly
referenced throughout.
Pieces segue into each
other, some discrete -
such as Gabby Wong’s
audience-interactive,
Telegram-based ‘Eternal
Peace’ - and others more
liminal, particularly the
absorbing and haunting
dances reenacting the dis-
jointedness and violence
exerted on the population
(Ghost Chan, Francis
John Chan and Shum Pui
Yung). Isabella Leung’s
recurring ‘Puss in Booth’
character is a hysterical
and self-absorbed radio
host whose Freedom Hi
programme announces
the show. It’s an interna-
tional broadcast - ﬁelding
callers from the trapped
PolyU student for whom
romance and resistance
go hand in hand, to the
frontliner/comrade raging
against the ‘popo’ and
the dehumanisation of
protesters. Carrie Lam is
warned not to “go after
our c*nts because she’s
got one too!” The Chinese
part of the title of the
show means ‘Freedom’
or ‘Liberty’. However
the last character (trans-
literation: ‘hai’) is a
homophone for ‘vagina’,
colloquially used to mean
‘c*nt’ or ‘total failure’,
a connection similarly
sardonically exploited in
protest songs (no relation
to the play).
Darker edges are
always apparent. In
‘Motif’, fruit peels are
discarded while Bonnie
Chan reads out the names
of Chan Yin-lam and
others, and the dates on
which they died in suspect
circumstances - from Sep-
tember 2019 to February
2020. These are dismissed
as “not suspicious” by the
ofﬁcious authority charac-
ter (Yik-Sau Chung).
Altogether, the show
paystributetotheessential
creativity of actor-groups
in the movement - by
emulating it, mirroring
it, performing it, and
meta-commenting on it.
Early on, Jennifer Lim’s
character sharply draws
up the notion that we
are ever really “ready”
to tell such stories. “If
we don’t move quickly
we lose the history that’s
already deleting itself”;
but this fear becomes
undercut with another:
that “some better set-up
well-meaning white artist
might do it for us”. This
elicits knowing laughter,
yet uncomfortably mirrors
overriding concerns
within (and outside) the
movement on challenging
the whitewashing of the
British state and its actors
“bask[ing in] performa-
tive solidarity.” Freedom
Hi demands its audience
to explore and reimagine
their involvement, by
leaving behind real ques-
tions we all must grapple
with.

Kong // Alexander Newton
“Taking this work off the streets... we’re wondering if we’re ready. It still feels raw. But if we don’t move quickly we’ll
lose the history that’s already deleting itself”
