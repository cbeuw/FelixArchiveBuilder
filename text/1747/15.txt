Lipstick: A Coping Mechanism and A Taboo
T

S o u t h w a r k ’s
P l a y h o u s e ’ s
newest produc-
tion Lipstick is weird
and wonderful in many
ways. Sure, there isn’t the
glitz and glam of a bigger
theatre and you can count
the cast on one hand, but
these types of small shows
are rewarding in their own
way, presenting an inti-
mate story in an intimate
venue.
The story is set in an
unnamed, average British
town and sees young
Tommy (April Hughes)
develop an unlikely
friendship with football
lad Jordan (Helen Aluko).
Jordan is obsessed with
rebellious drinking at
chatting about girls,
whereas Tommy’s mind
seems occupied by other
things. Tommy is the
antithesis of the laddish
culture his new friend rep-
resents and spends lots of
time alone in his bedroom
applying makeup. No, he
is not a drag queen, trans
or a “fag” as Jordan puts
it. He uses the makeup as
a coping mechanism for
the anxiety he experiences
on a daily basis.
Playwright Lily
Shahmoon does a good job
at crafting nippy dialogue
which the audience fully
believes that two teenage
boys would be spouting.
Shahmoon accurately
represents these menial
conversations, she seems
to have lots of relevant
experiences as a teenage
boy! It has to be noted
that Hughes and Aluko
are not teenage boys
either, they are women.
The question which many
in the audience must have
been asking is: why cast
two women to play two
teenage boys? Is there
really such a drought
of young male actors?
Apparently Shahmoon
actually specified this in
the script that the casting
be done in this way. The
whole play is trying to
challenge our precon-
ceived ideas of gender
and this constant visual
reminder does a good job
at achieving that.
Hughes and Aluko
are very convincing
teenage boys and keep
adding new dimensions
to their characters with
every scene. The themes
explored in this coming
of age piece aren’t really
about sexuality but rather
about anxiety. The ending
scenes seem to almost
compare the situation of
the two young boys, this
did not seem absolutely
necessary as in some
ways it belittled Jordan’s
struggles. However the
play must be applauded in
the way it visually depicts
anxiety. The scenes in
the nightclub - not sure
how two 16 year olds got
in - shows Tommy expe-
riencing panic/anxiety
attacks. Using a combi-
nation of lighting, sound
and of course acting,
the audience can really
understand what anxiety
really feels like.
Imperial College Symphony Orchestra: Spring Term
Concert
I
t is always a great
pleasure to attend
an Imperial College
Orchestra concert.
How these musicians
manage to maintain their
remarkable standard and
attend courses at Imperial
is quite beyond me.
Perhaps that’s why I gave
up music when I got here.
However, although very
good and certainly mem-
orable, there are always
areas of a performance
that one can iron out.
The concert was launched
by Portsmouth Point, a
piece inspired by a print of
the British fleet departing
from port. The print features
many scenes of merrymak-
ing and intoxication, and the
piece mirrored this, bustling
with energy, as the original
print bustled with activity,
with the theme being enthu-
siastically passed between
different sections of the or-
chestra. Occasionally, it felt
as though the orchestra em-
phasised the theme of intox-
ication, scrambling to keep
up with the hectic score.
Enjoyable and rapid, it cer-
tainly primed my ears for the
rest of the concert.
The next piece was Con-
certo for Violin and Or-
chestra, by Stuart Hancock,
featuring violin soloist Jack
Liebeck. Here, the orchestra
proved their mettle as an en-
semble that understands the
subtleties of playing “second
fiddle.” A soaring perfor-
mance by Liebeck was ably
supported by the orchestra. I
particularly enjoyed the vul-
must be honest and confess
that I preferred the gentle
beginning of the piece com-
pared to the more rambunc-
tious conclusion.
The orchestra finally
came into their own in the
second half with Mussorg-
sky’s Pictures at an Exhibi-
tion. Mussorgsky’s composi-
tion features many different
vignettes, as a tribute to his
deceased artist friend named
Victor Hartmann. The or-
chestra surged into this
rendition, featuring many
excellent solos from across
the group. The trumpets, of
course, performed an excel-
lent job, but the true moment
of the piece was the saxo-
phonist’s solo. Wonderfully
executed and performed with
panache this piece made for
a fitting end to a concert
from one of the UK’s most
excellent university sympho-
ny orchestras. I, for one, am
very much looking forward
to their summer recital!
