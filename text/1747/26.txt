“There aren’t
any crackling
caramel layers,
but it tastes
amazing
anyway”
N
ow, it’s no
secret that
crème brûlée
and meringues
are hard-to-pronounce
fancy desserts, but luckily
for you, we here at Felix
break it down for you
to digest as Pi weekend
comes around. Both of
these are made together
for convenience’s sake -
one uses egg yolks, and
the other takes care of the
egg whites.
All you need for crème
brûlée is double cream,
egg yolks, sugar, vanilla
essence, and salt.
In a saucepan that you
can stir your cream with
a spoon and not be burnt,
pour in the double cream,
2 tablespoons of sugar, an
eighth of a teaspoon of
salt, and half a teaspoon
of the vanilla, and keep it
on low heat. Stir that mix
and put on some music
(I recommend a musical,
perhaps the soundtrack to
Hamilton). If your double
cream refuses to vacate
its pot, leave it near the
flame and scoop out with
a spoon. From my expe-
rience with baking, don’t
bother with the exact
proportions of differences
between American and
British tablespoons. Use
whatever you think is an
eating spoon as a table-
spoon, and a teaspoon is
roughly a third of that.
Fractions are running
rampant today! (Not like
on the 14th, because pi
is irrational) While your
cream and sugar mixture
is reaching a bare simmer,
preheat your oven to about
150 degrees Celcius, and
separate your eggs.
By separating your
eggs, I don’t mean from
each other. I mean sepa-
rating the egg yolks from
the egg whites, with the
yolks in a bowl, and the
whites in a big metal
mixing bowl. Leave the
egg whites for now - we’ll
come to them when
making the meringues.
Beat the eggs together,
and turn off the heat
when your cream reaches
that bare simmer. Now,
mix in the remaining 3
tablespoons of sugar into
the yolks, one spoon at a
time. Mix in the sugar just
before you start adding
in the cream - you might
end up with eggy lumps
otherwise! Slowly, spoon
in the warm cream mix,
making sure to mix the
egg yolks while doing
so. This process, known
as tempering, prevents
the yolks from curdling,
where heat from the
mixture cooks the yolk.
I don’t know about you,
but I prefer my sweet
dishes to not taste like
an omelet. Once you’ve
mixed about an equal
volume of cream and
yolks without curdling,
pour the entire thing back
into the saucepan and
mix. If some curdling
does occur, keep in mind
that the only people eating
this experiment are broke
university students - they
are probably the kind of
plebs who can’t taste the
difference between caster
sugar and regular white
sugar. By this point, the
mix may have stuck to
the edges of the pan and
become denser. Just mix it
together.
Pour into the ramekins
of your choice - I reused
some oven-proof glass
pots that used to contain
some sort of cheesecake
from Tesco, make do with
what you have. Keep in
mind that ramekins are
not the only things ov-
en-proof, and spring-form

Crème brûlée
Ingredients:
• 240 ml of double
cream (or heavy
cream, depending
on which one is on
sale)
• 2 egg yolks (keep
them albumin!)
• 2 + 3 tbsp sugar
(your flatmates
don’t need sugar
anyway)
• 1/8 tsp salt (at
which point,
should we even
bother?)
• 1/2 tsp vanilla
essence
cake pans are NOT leak-
proof. There is no need to
ask me how I know this,
trust me on this one.
Place these ramekins
in the oven, on the middle
shelf. Set a timer for 30
minutes, and keep some
sugar on hand to sprinkle
if it looks like the top is
turning brown, and keep
in the oven for another 10
minutes after that. Take
it out when the middle
doesn’t jiggle if the glass is
tapped. Sure, there aren’t
any flaming torches and
crackly caramel layers on
top, but it tastes amazing
anyway. This makes the
perfect gift for your guy
this Saturday (White Day,
or have you forgotten
already?).
