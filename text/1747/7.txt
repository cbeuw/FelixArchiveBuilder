O
nce upon a
time, I prob-
ably would
have cared
that the fleshbag puppet
of America Corp Inc.
was going to win the US
Democratic nomination
to run against Harvey
Weinsteins actalike. I
probably would have
raged against the injustice
of the caucus voting
system, or screamed in
rage at the mention of the
name Clinton. At the very
least I would have written
a political rant on Reddit
about how stupid the US
was for not feeling the
#Bern. It’d probably get,
like, 3 upvotes like all my
other posts. Totally worth!
However, now that
I’ve recognised the hope-
lessness of any political
position that isn’t to the
right of Hayek, I’ve found
a new solution: complete
and utter political apathy.
Since starting my
course of apathy 3 weeks
ago, I can honestly say
that I have never been
happier.
Back in the day, when
I was woke as fuck, I
used to get up, look at
the news and think, wow
isn’t the world just so
unfair and unjust. Now
I just think, what great
weather, maybe I’ll eat a
sandwich or stare at a wall
that the lack of legal
aid available to poorer
members of society in
the UK was undermining
the fairness of our whole
justice system. Now with
apathy, I just kick back,
read the sports section of
the BBC and be happy
that someone’s having a
great time kicking a ball
around.
It hasn’t always been
so easy though. Over my
time as a socialist-anar-
chist that believed that the
black flag would one day
fly over the White House
if only everyone would
realise the necessity
of communally owned
property, I made a lot of
friends that thought the
same way I did. We all
used to wear a badge with
Chomsky’s face on it. It
was just our thing. Any
time I try and talk to them
now, they keep trying to
take my apathy away from
me. One of them keeps
shouting at me about how
corporations create most
of the world’s carbon
emissions. Now I’m just
glad they’ve found a way
to express themselves.
I’ve finally realised
that, with apathy, not only
am I a happier person,
but I can finally use all
that white priviledge I’ve
been banking up for years.
Forget guilt and being
sensitive to minorities,
now’s the time for me to
finally acknowledge that
“Now I don’t
even care
what’s going
in this pull
quote!”
the system is not my fault
and make out like a bandit
with the full power of
institutionalised racism on
my side. No one will stand
in my way! Especially not
me!

“With apathy,
I just don’t
give a fuck.
Maybe I’ll eat

or stare at a

hour”
for half an hour. I used to
be permanently worried
