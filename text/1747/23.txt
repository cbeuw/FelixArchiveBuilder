Ear candy: Self Help and GRLwood
O
xford based
Self Help have
been touring
hard this
season but that doesn’t
stop them from releasing
‘Milkshake’, a swirling
psychedelic punk song
with a punchy hook
guaranteed to bring all the
boys to the yard. After a
first listen, what stands out
is the song’s multiple con-
trasts throughout: Danny
Jeffries’ synthy guitar
spiraling behind drummer
Silke Blansjaar’s catchy
cowbell riff (are cowbells
capable of riffing?) which
clashes with the hard-hit-
ting punk background
of Sean Cousins’ guitar.
Cousins’ vocals harshly
contradict bassist Lizzie
Couves’ softly spoken
vocals which leads to, at
first glance, a slight mess
of a song. Upon further
listen though it’s possible
to pick out the vocal
hook and recognise that
‘Milkshake’ is Self Help’s
take on current society,
seen in lyrics like “you
want free speech, but you
don’t move”. Overall, the
song is brilliant, a true
amalgamation of genres
which hints at a new
sound from Self Help is to
come.
GRLwood, the self-de-
fined screamo pop duo
from Kentucky, recently
released an eponymously
entitled live EP, with the
first song called ‘Mas-
turbation Fun Station’.
GRLwood often use satire
to engage their audience
with important messages,
and this song is no dif-
ferent. Singer/guitarist
Rej Forester yells and
squeaks about masturba-
tion in a tongue in cheek
manner: “they said go
fuck yourself//so I did”.
Drummer Karen Ledford
backs this up with fast
punchy drums to com-
pliment Forester’s brisk
guitar; the result isn’t
particularly ambitious
musically but clicks into
place with the lyrics in a
way that makes perfect
sense. GRLwood could
be described as riot grrrl,
queer-core or punk but
they’re something more: a
shimmering new glimpse
of pop rock music which
can appeal to anyone with
a sense of humour and an
open mind.
