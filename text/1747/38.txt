Migraine Sufferers
See the Light
In February, research
into our understanding of
migraines took another
step forward, with the
finding that the brains of
migraine sufferers show
a heightened response in
the visual cortex area to
striped images – a ‘hyper-
excitable’ visual cortex.
The study, a collaboration
between scientists at the
Centre for Human Brain
Health and School of
Psychology at Birming-
ham University and the
Psychology department
of Lancaster University,
involved 60 volunteers
and even stratified for the
sub-group of migraine
sufferers that experience
visual disturbances – the
aura – as a regular part of
their migraines. The team
hope to map the brain’s
response over time, so
changes preceding a
migraine can be mapped.
It is thought that this mon-
itoring can help predict
migraines and support
preventative measures.
From Plastic Jellyfish
to Plastic Smellyfish
A paper published this
week in Current Biology
revealed that Loggerhead
sea turtles have a similar
response to the smell of
plastic waste as they do
to food scents. This gives
insight into the mystery
as to why sea turtles are
attracted to plastic and
end up ingesting it or
becoming trapped in it. It
supersedes visual-based
theories, such as the
‘plastic-jellyfish’ hy-
pothesis which proposed
that floating plastic bags
were mistakenly ingested
due to their similarity
to jellyfish. The study
presented odours of
turtle food, water, clean
plastic, or bio-fouled
plastic to Loggerhead
turtles and monitored
their movement towards
the odours. Bio-fouled
plastic – plastic exposed
to micro- and macrobiota
for five weeks – elicited
a response ‘indistinguish-
able’ from that of turtle
food.
Dr Octopus Brought
to Life – or at least,
one tentacle is
Late February saw
a development in soft
robotics, as a team from
Harvard and Beihang
University created an
octopus-inspired arm –
complete with suction
pads. The robotic arm
mimics the tapered design
of an octopus tentacle,
and is the first to combine
this with a bending
motion and suction pads,
meaning added flexibility
and finer control. Directed
by a change in pressure
to control the arm’s bend,
and vacuum to activate the
suction pads, it can safely
handle a wider variety of
objects than its predeces-
sors, including delicate,
odd-shaped items like
eggs and test tubes.
Longevity Found to
be a Universal Truth
Women live longer than
men – this fact generally
holdstrueacrosstheglobe,
although women’s health
in some countries is sig-
nificantly down-trodden
compared to this average.
Now, reported in Biology
Letters earlier this month,
scientists found that this
rule also applies across
the animal kingdom.
The team reviewed 229
species and found that
on average, the sex with
matching chromosomes
had a 17.6% longer
lifespan. Possession of
matching chromosomes
is thought to confer
protection from genetic
mutations, by access to
a second, ‘clean’, copy.
However, not all animals
have an X and Y based
sex chromosome system
– for instance, birds and
reptiles have a ZW based
system, where males
possess the matching pair
(ZZ). In instances where
the male gender possessed
the matching pair, the
lifespan gain dropped to
just over 7%, suggesting
there is something else at
play…
“Scientists

lifespan”
“Bio-fouled
plastic elicited
a response
‘indinstingui-
shable from
that of turtle
food”
