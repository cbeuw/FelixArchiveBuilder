Students Occupy College Main Entrance to Protest
Imperial’s Fossil Fuel Investments
A
group of
students are
involved in
a week-long
occupation of the Col-
lege’s Main Entrance
in order to protest what
they view as unethical
College investments in
the fossil fuel and arms
industries.
The occupation began
with a protest at lunchtime
on Monday organised by
Extinction Rebellion Im-
perial College, alongside
numerous other societies
and groups such as Divest
Imperial. Speeches were
given by activists on
Queen’s Lawn, denounc-
ing the College’s invest-
ments and listing three
demands: “Decarbonise,
Decolonise and Democ-
ratise”.
Piers Corbyn, brother
of Labour Leader Jeremy
Corbyn and former Pres-
ident of Imperial College
Union, was also in
attendance, handing out
flyers titled “Man-Made
Climate-Change Doesn’t
Exist”.
After the speeches,
the student protestors
marched on the roads
around the College,
chanting slogans such as
“no more coal, no more
oil, keep that carbon in the
soil” and “say it loud, say
it clear, BP Shell aren’t
welcome here”. At one
point, a car tried to edge
into the crowd outside the
Royal School of Mines,
only to be stopped by the
students.
The march ended at
the Main Entrance, where
further speeches were
given by students and a
UCU staff member on
strike. The role of Alice
Gast, President of Imperi-
al College London, on the
Board of Directors of the
controversial oil company
Chevron, was highlighted
by protestors as “corrup-
tion” in the university.
The occupation started
after the speeches ended,
with around fifteen stu-
dents staying at the Main
Entrance with intentions
to stay for the week until
the national climate strike
on Friday afternoon.
College security were
seen observing the action
from a distance, but did
not intervene.
The students used
was a bold stance to take:
“Whether they’re able to
do it all the way through,
that’s one thing, but the
fact that they’ve even
started it sends a message
that will be felt through-
out the university.” Both
Surya and Sohaib had
never been to a climate
protest before, but said the
occupation had brought
the issue to their attention
and they were considering
joining one in the future.
Asofthetimeofwriting,
the occupation was still
ongoing with almost half
of the Main Entrance
foyer occupied, and the
Queen Victoria statue in
the Main Entrance having
been converted to an ar-
tistic statement in protest
(see front cover.) There
are unspecified plans to
further escalate the action
on Thursday and Friday.
The College offered the
following statement:
“We respect the right
to peaceful protest and
have no plans to remove
protestors from the Main
Entrance. We understand
the depth of feeling among
our community about this
important issue and will
continue to engage in
discussion with our staff
and students.”
enable the university to
keep on business as usual,
but under the pretence
of ethical investment. It
renders the policy useless
and nothing more than
greenwashing.” Solvejg
continued to point out that
the policy specifies that
College would divest from
illegal arms: “I would sure
hope that that was never
the case to start with, as
the university investing
in something illegal is a
deeply troubling concept.”
In her eyes, the SRI
Policy is an “inadequate
response” and that’s why
the students have chosen
to escalate their actions to
an occupation.
When asked about the
response that occupying
students received, Solvejg
noted that security hadn’t
intervened, “which is
fantastic, but it’s almost
like we aren’t being taken
seriously yet.”
Another student, Steph-
anie, echoed those words:
“Some security staff have
specifically said they are
supportive of the action…
and we aren’t here to
disrupt them, we are here
to disrupt senior manage-
ment”. Stephanie said she
had been involved with
organising the occupation
as part of Extinction
Rebellion Universities
for “months” and empha-
sised the importance of
logistics when planning
an action like this. “The
first thing is the safety of
the people involved… we
need to think about, do we
have the training and the
tactics in place to be able
to handle the worst case
scenario and de-escalate
situations? You have to
also be really clear about
what your aim is”
At the information
stall, curious students had
come up to speak to pro-
testors and find out what
was going on. “It’s good
to see people standing up
for something this impor-
tant,” said Surya Sridha-
ran, a medicine student
passing by. On Alice Gast,
Surya said “It’s important
to have people who don’t
have bias when it comes
to decisions that affect
everybody.”
Another student,
Sohaib Zia, said “I find
that very questionable…
I’m not a big fan of
having someone in a place
of power with strong links
to an industry like that.”
When asked about the
students’ five day occu-
pation, he said he felt it

chairs and tables lying
around the Main Entrance
foyer to carve out a space
for themselves, using
banners and placards to
demarcate the space they
were occupying. The
most visible banner was
right next to the revolving
doors, which meant that
all people would see the
words “Imperial, Stop
Greenwashing!” upon
entering the College.
A timetable of events
had been devised and
displayed around the
occupied space, featuring
events such as ‘indige-
nous film screenings’, and
discussions on climate
refugees and neocolonial-
ism. The occupation also
featured a manned stall
with information on the
protest and Imperial’s in-
vestments, where students
could come and learn
about what was going on.

tion.
