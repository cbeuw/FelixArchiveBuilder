Add in that one drop
of lemon juice to the egg
whites when you get the
chance, this secret ingre-
dient will give your me-
ringues that extra gloss.
Your mixing bowl
comes in handy, as you
use your whisker to whisk
these at medium speed.
When the egg whites seem
to be completely made up
of white bubbles, add in
about a third of your sugar
and continue to whisk
until it seems to be fully
incorporated. Continue
adding sugar and whisking
until all the sugar is used
up, and whisk until your
meringues become glossy
and shiny, and stay in stiff
white peaks. If you feel
particularly confident, see
if overturning the bowl
over your head gives you
an unexpected shower.
This test complete, use
one big spoon to scoop out
the meringue mix onto a
lightly buttered oven tray,
using another spoon to
help your scoop. (none of
that piping bag nonsense).
This ensures evenly sized
scoops, and you can
accurately decide to make
smaller ones to give to the
flatmates that don’t clean
up after themselves. Or
not. I’m not telling you
how to live your life, nor
how to exact passive-ag-
gressive revenge. A secret
to round meringues: use
a toothpick to make the
dollops of meringue less
dollop-looking and more
flat-looking.

While you wait for the
crème brûlée, get started
on your meringues. This
requires the following
ingredients:
Meringue
Ingredients:
• 2 egg whites (aren’t
you glad you saved
them now?)
• 1/8 tsp of cream of
tartar (or twice that
amount of lemon
juice, which at this
point really means a
drop of lemon juice)
• 110g sugar - the
standard is to use
50 grams of sugar
per egg white and
then add on 10
grams to the total (I
mean, if you’re go-
ing to get diabetes
anyway, go full in?)
still-hot oven, and set a
timer for two hours. Settle
down with a past paper
or two, because once the
two hours are up, DO
NOT OPEN THE OVEN
DOOR. Let the oven
cool down completely,
and then take them out.
This prevents premature
deflation. I would recom-
mend starting the baking
process after dinner, at
around 9 pm. This leaves
us with crème brûlée at
10 pm, and if you turn off
the oven at midnight, you
get perfectly beautiful me-
ringues to eat at breakfast.
Note: the writer of this
article takes no legal re-
sponsibility whatsoever if
anyone attempts to do this
and ends up with diabetes,
heart disease, or burns.
