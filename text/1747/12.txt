The Time Machine: A Prescient Journey through the
Fourth Dimension
Be transported through time as you lose yourself in this production at the iconic London Library.
W
e met our
time trav-
eller soon
after walk-
ing through a glitzy door,
standing at the bottom of
one of the plush staircases
of the London Library.
The location is exquisite
and could have leaked
out of the inky pages of a
historical novel - perhaps
that is why it was chosen
to be the setting for this
strange, yet unique, tour
through time.
Our Time Traveller
(Paul Taylor) looks very
steampunk, wearing
medieval looking clothes
with a strangely modern
feel to them. He looks at
us in shock, examining us,
sometimes uncomfortably
closely, scrutinising our
faces with the expression
of a man who has chanced
upon his unexpected
saviours. We are truly
immersed, as we follow
him on a journey into
the heart of this historic
building, through the
various hidden gems
of rooms, where socks
(or the Time Traveller’s
iconic round glasses)
change colour when
you’re not looking, and
the ever-present threat of
beings known as morlocks
drives us forward.
The Time Machine
is an adaptation of H.G
Wells’ full length work of
fiction by the same name,
that describes the journey
of a man 800,000 years
into the future, where he
witnesses an unrecog-
nisably weird post-apoc-
alyptic society. Wells
who was an alumnus of
Imperial (well, actually,
technically of a College
that eventually became
part of it), is perceived by
many to be the father of
science fiction, and intro-
duced the concept of the
time machine to the world
through this novella.
This production,
written by Jonathan
Holloway and directed
by Natasha Rickman,
takes the story and makes
it relevant to today.
Interestingly, Holloway
interviewed experts from
the renowned Wellcome
Centre for Ethics and Hu-
manities in order to learn
about possible problems
with future societies.
They predicted, among
other phenomena includ-
ing human augmentation,
that another SARS-like
pandemic would spread
around the world. The
catch is that this was in
the late months of 2019,
well before the C word
replaced the B word as
a permanent fixture on
the bottom bars of news
channels worldwide. It
seems that the material
that has fleshed out the
original story for this pro-
duction is indeed relevant
and prescient, having
stood the test of… time
until now.
Our Time Traveller
dynamism guides us
smoothly through the
various stages of our
journey, keeping us en-
tertained while managing
to instil a genuine fear for
the morlocks. Through-
out the production, we
witness his interactions
with various figures
in time. Notably, The
Computer (Graeme Rose)
- an embodied machine
with a dry wit, who puts
on an acutely mechanical
display: he must have
very dry eyes given I
didn’t see him blink once,
but maybe machines don’t
require eyelids to refresh
their visual sensors. Or
indeed, the clinical DRI
(Sarah Edwardson),
who certainly puts on an
impressive show in the
convincing persona of
a scientific government
bureaucrat who is as at
conflict with herself and
her own actions as with
our Time Traveller.
The audience are not
simply an audience, since
that would imply a group
of passive listeners, but
we are instead encouraged
right from the beginning
to become part of the cast
and imbue our energy
into the production in
various ways, such as
through gathering round,
touching various objects,
and speaking to various
people, all the while
traipsing through the often
unique and book-laden
aisles of a beautiful
and historic building
that forms a perfect
setting for a story about
transportation through
time. Indeed, the place
seems to be a part of time
itself, with various cast
members appearing and
suddenly disappearing
into the maze once again,
as if they had jumped a
few years backwards or
forwards suddenly. Very
few props are employed
and the flow of the story is
moulded to the geography
of the library, with little in
the way of scenery. It is
impressive how the sound
and lighting team manage
to exploit this to enhance
the experience and turn the
library into a trip through
the 4th dimension.
The production itself
is a damning criticism of
greed, selfishness, and
disregard for the planet
that our future selves and
children will inherit. The
environment, disease, and
a society motivated by a
love for money are all at
the forefront of the story
through and through. It
makes you think and does
so in a very engaging and
interesting way, bringing
the classic novella to life.
I would encourage you
to go and witness this
journey for yourself, but
whether you see it in the
future or the past is up to
you.
