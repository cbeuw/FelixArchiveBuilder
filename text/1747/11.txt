Shoe Lady: a play for when it all goes wrong

The IT Crowd
fame stars
as Viv, a middle-class
working mother whose
Tuesday morning is vio-
lently thrown off course
by a poorly hung curtain,
in Shoe Lady. Viv’s day
goes from bad to worse
as a buckle on her sole
pair of shoes breaks while
travelling to work, leaving
her with only one shoe
and the conundrum of
reflects on the impact of
high-stress city living,
with Viv exclaiming “I
never knew how much
this city hurt me until
today” as she cradles her
bleeding foot.
The production is
well-staged with a set
including trees and
curtains lowered from the
ceiling, a retractable bed,
and – central to the pro-
duction – a treadmill that
relentlessly rotates and
maintains the momentum
of the performance, while
bringing the actors ever
closer to the edge (of
the stage). Two sets of
stairs emerging from the
stage allow stagehands to
seamlessly transition from
scene to scene during the
65-minute performance
with no intervals.
Elements of Shoe Lady
bring to mind parallels
of Tennesse Williams’
handling of tragedy for
the middle-class But these
are interspersed with
unnecessary repetition
and clumsy comedy,
which gives the play a
confused and frenzied
tone. Hopping from a
house-viewing with
talking curtains to a police
station, and from Russell
& Bromley to Viv’s office
bathroom as she takes the
shoes from a coworker
using the toilet, the
audience is left laughing
with uncertainty in places.
Parkinson delivers an
admirable performance,
which is fully believable
and reminiscent of an
adult Alice in Wonderland
wandering through the
streets of London.
A very special, Special Relationship
W
hen you
think de-
p o r t a t i o n
from the US
and ICE, the notorious
immigration enforcement
agency, you are probably
most likely to jump to
thoughts of caged South
American migrant chil-
dren, or the increasing
efforts of the current
administration to deport
anyone and everyone it
can find. However, in an
international environment
that is increasingly hostile
to foreigners of all creeds
and nationalities, The
Special Relationship is
the story of 6 US residents
with British citizenship
that, with varying degrees
of culpability, have fallen
afoul of the American
legal system and been
deported.
The characters rep-
resent a diverse cross
section of society, a
mother who fakes cheques
to get by, a meth addict, a
drunk driver, a concerned
father, a cocaine trucker
for the Mexican mafia
and a convicted murderer,
each based on interviews
with people that really had
these experiences. Each
tells their tale, sometimes
tragic, often comic with
the shadow of Curtis, an
ICE agent that haunts
each of their stories. For
those of you unaware, ICE
is the Immigration and
Customs Enforcement
(ICE) of the USA. Curtis,
played by the exquisitely
cast Nicholas Beveney,
looms over each of the
character’s stories as they
develop from infraction to
sentencing to deportation,
in a set of tales that would
be harrowing and tragic
if they weren’t broken
up by perfectly comedic
interludes.
Trump and May, then
Trump and Johnson,
slowdance their way
around the stage, exactly
mimicked by the highly
talented Duncan Wisbey,
adding a peculiar level of
lightness and hilarity to a
play that would otherwise
be difficult to watch
without breaking down
into tears. The musical
and comic interludes are
perfectly timed, with
enough biting satire and
cunning wit to fuel a room
full of Mock the Week
Panelists, pre-departure of
Frankie Boyle obviously.
All joking aside of
course, this is an excel-
lent production that I
left feeling entertained,
informed and above all
reflective. Immigration
and deportation is one of
those tricky, emotionally
charged issues that we
face in the modern day
that it can be hard to have
an enlightened conversa-
tion about. However, this
production handled such a
sensitive topic incredibly
well, using the testimony
of real people to develop
one of the best plays I
have seen with nuance
and honesty. This is
something we absolutely
have to talk about. In the
words of Curtis, “there
will always be a home for
immigration.”

one shoe or none at all?
The play largely takes
the form of an internal
monologue delivered by
Viv, interrupted in parts
by short conversations
with her husband, son,
and another similarly
single-shod woman she
meets on the street. It
provides a critique of
modern middle-class life,
capitalism, and consum-
erism, with the single
shoe providing a useful
lens through which to
view it. “One shoe and
you look like something
you’re not; two shoes and
you’re normal” - having
those two shoes is some-
thing that we all take for
granted. The simple act
of losing one shoe causes
unforeseen consequences
for the family as they “fall
off the carousel”, which
is mirrored by the woman
living on the street without
footwear. The play also
