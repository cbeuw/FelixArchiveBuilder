Man Alive! and so is King Krule’s Enduring Despair
F
ew artists meld
genres into a
distinct, nuanced
style like Archy
Marshall. A man of many
monikers, Archy’s releas-
es under King Krule have
been his most critically
acclaimed. Man Alive!
is King Krule’s third
album, following 2013’s
6 Feet Beneath the Moon
and 2017’s The Ooz.
Both of those previous
projects were outstanding
displays of his artistic
ability, bodies of work
that listeners have formed
an intimate relationship
with. 6 Feet Beneath the
Moon, one of my personal
favourite albums, was an
entirely raw, vulnerable
and angst-ridden expres-
sion for despondent youth.
The Ooz on the other
hand, though similarly
bleak, traded rawness
for richness. The malaise
was presented through
a sonically dynamic,
thematically expansive
and lyrically dense and
poetic lens – a literal
oozing of inner sludge
into new corners and
depths. This album, on the
whole, lies somewhere
in between, more opaque
and unyielding than
anything King Krule has
done as of yet, despite still
wearing its isolation and
emotional potency on its
sleeve. King Krule paints
with abstruse, anecdotal
strokes this time, his typ-
ically abstract motifs and
imagery serving as snap-
shots rather than heady
sketches.
The opening track,
three tracks is immediate-
ly urgent, riotous. When
asked about ‘Super-
mache’, Archie stated that
supermarkets serve as a
rich source of inspiration
due to the heightened
societalcontiguityofover-
hearing propaganda-in-
fluenced conversations
whilst deciding which
mass-produced products
are most conducive to
one’s physical sustenance.
Indeed, futile attempts
at environmentally con-
scious consumption is
added, on this album, to
the arsenal of references
that form King Krule’s
vivid, esoteric world –
track, adding to the
lucid, confrontational
atmosphere created by
the teasing, hop-scotching
bass, drilling electric
guitar and contorting sax.
The track is a fitting com-
panion to the one before,
‘Stoned Again’, where
drunk drums coated in
dusty reverb evoke a deep
internal storm that brews
persistently, exploding on
the chorus. In his loose,
freestyled verses, Archie
conveys the frustrating
inevitability of his weed
dependence.
The album takes a
mellow turn after this.
Following the naked,
grieved on ‘Has This
Hit?’. On ‘Slinky’, which
transitions seamlessly
from ‘Alone, Omen 3’,
Archie elaborates on his
fear of isolation with
some of the most heart-
felt lyrics of the album,
presenting a caveat to his
more optimistic outlook
on depression: “Bruising
on my right side feels so
/ With thoughts of her
displacement”. ‘(Don’t
Let The Dragon) Draag
On’ a couple tracks later
feels like a direct response
to ‘Alone, Omen 3’ and
‘Slinky’: an immersive,
languid dive into the
motions of depression
rather than a reassuring
rumination on it. Its stale,
sardonic grip haunts in the
lyrics, as Archie describes
a room “bathed in grey”
where the “walls get
taller”.
A delicate, meditative
moment, ‘Airport Antena-
tal Airplane’ presents the
most direct reflection on
Archie’s initiation to fa-
therhood, the anticipation
for which influenced his
headspace when record-
ing much of the album. A
warm, weighted texture is
created by the thick guitar
plucks and soft, shuffling,
staccato drums paired with
the remixed, chopped and
glued sample of singer
Nilüfer Yanya’s ethereal,
laden voice. ‘Underclass’
takes a similarly personal
approach with Archie’s
attention this time focused
on his partner. Following
the same formula as a few
other tracks on the album,
a soft, desolate instrumen-
tal hovers diffuse, before
being brought to the fore-
ground by a singing sax.
He reflects on anxiety’s
role in his relationship, its
persistent attempt to push
against intimacy and lend
doubt to his experience
of affection. He describes
this mind state, the place
he was in when he met his
partner, as being “Under
the underclass / Deep in
society’s hole”. Implying
a fear of returning to that
place, he repeats “But
little did I know”, perhaps
suggesting that the unex-
pected pregnancy caused
a welcome rerouting of
his mind’s trajectory.
He elaborates on this
sentiment on ‘Please
Complete Thee’, the
last track of the album,
offering himself wholly
to his partner, “Please
complete me / It must be
the answer”. Far from
a romantic gesture, the
song is a plea over a bare
instrumental. In a time of
increasing humanitarian
tragedy and political an-
tagonising, Archie’s true
sentiment when he is done
taking inspiration from
the chaos of it all in su-
permarkets and in parks is
relatable disillusionment:
“Everything just seems to
be numbness around”. His
burning desire to be with
loved ones at a time like
now is existential: “Have
you seen the disasters?
/ We don’t have long ‘til
this earth is drowned”.
In places, Man Alive!’s
lyrics only create the
façade of abstract poetry,
when they really serve
to lend an aesthetic, or
just sound cool. In ‘The
Dream’, a redundant
soundscape interlude
between the upbeat and
more atmospheric tracks,
the lullabied, “Stop
making sense of things”
comes across as an excuse
for the album’s consistent
lyrical elusiveness. The
track also exemplifies the
album’s tendency to sonic
fogginess, which hinges
on tiresome during the last
few tracks upon repeat
listens. Though its prede-
cessors are therefore more
listenable and will likely
prove more enduring than
Man Alive!, the album is a
welcome addition to King
Krule’s unique discogra-
phy.

MAN ALIVE!
(“But all I got was swept
aside / Like the pesticide
in your vegetables,” he
growls on ‘Comet Face’ a
couple tracks later; “You
flew economy / Reserved
your ecology,” he croons
on ‘Airport Antenatal
Airplane’). The former
recounts, through some
of the most coded lyrics
of the album, a cycle of
waking up with delinquent
company in Peckham
Rye, messy and injured
from the previous night’s
events that now feel like a
“past life”. Sped-up vocals
from the Otis Redding
drum break sample are
looped throughout the
sobering expression of
isolation on ‘Perfecto Mis-
erablé’, ‘Alone, Omen 3’
offers a beautiful moment
dedicated to navigating a
depressive period. “The
ache and thunder in the
storms of your mind /
Soak it in, for the rain
will pass in time,” Archie
advises, acknowledging
that as much meaning
can be found in the pain,
tribulations and hatred of
life as in the happiness,
blessings and love. This
represents a shift from his
6 Feet Beneath the Moon
days: “I know when I
look into the sky / There
is no meaning,” he once
“King Krule

snapshots
rather than
heady
sketches”
‘Cellular’, is one of the
album’s best. Disillu-
sioned acoustic guitar
licks underpin efferves-
cent, teetering digital
sound effects that skirt
around punching drums.
The lyrics touch on the
digitalisation of emotion
and the desensitizing
effect that has on our
reception to tragic news,
a theme mirrored in one
of the album’s later tracks
– ‘Theme for the Cross’.
The narration on ‘Cellular’
loosely describes a
telephone conversation
during a train journey,
which perhaps represents
Archy’s mental state, and
his loss of connection to
the world when it goes
under: “Below the ground
floor / We’re losing signal,
we’ve lost connection”.
We’re pointed to the
alienating and often ter-
rifying situation of being
“Abandoned to the voice
in my head”, where we
become our worst selves,
where we feel a primal
desire to be loved, as
Archie’s unhinged, cre-
scendoing chant conveys
on the outro: “I phone my
ex.”
