HANGMAN
Com Dummings,
a highly successful
Union Presidential
Candidate, has been
disqualified
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
T
he highly
s u c c e s s f u l
campaign to
get Com Dum-
mings elected as Union
president has come to an
end after his disqualifi-
cation.
Dummings had caused
amusement and horror
amongst candidates by
printing rolls of his own
flyers on soft paper and
offering them to students
who had run out of bog
roll as a result of coro-
navirus panic-induced
stockpiling. His competi-
tors, however, did not see
the funny side and report-
ed him to the Returning
officer for breaching the
rules on all posters having
to be more than 5 meteres
apart.
This disqualification
has come at the end of
a campaign marred by
numerous allegations of
malpractice and gaffes,
from the Interfaith Of-
ficer’s campaign slogan
of “I am really into faith”,
to the Student Trustee
caught lying multiple
times on camera in spite
of rules stating that candi-
dates for this role must be
upstanding.
Students have reacted
in horror to the suspen-
sion, with a petition de-
manding that Dummings
be named Union President
for Life in recognition of
his genius gaining 3000
signatures in less than two
days.
The Union disqualified
Dummings on the basis
that the leaflets did not
have the required #icue-
lections and thus breached
campaigning laws.
Dummings has claimed
however that the hashtag
was there and must have
been “covered in shit”.
Att Alarkey, 4th
year
DesEng student and
tandori restaurant regular
expressed support for
the Dummings campaign
stating, “The quality of
the paper is undeniably
high.”
The candidate himself
has responded furiously to
the news and has said that
he will appeal. “What can
I say? I was on a roll.”
