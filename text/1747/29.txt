T
he layman
definition of
inflation refers
to the increase in
the cost of goods and ser-
vices. Another definition
would be the reduction
of purchasing power due
to the loss of the intrinsic
value of money relative
to the cost of goods and
services. This provides
two perspectives, the
first being the goods and
services have a greater
perceived value and the
second that money has
lost its intrinsic value.
Both are somewhat
logical and relevant.
Why do I say that?
Let us begin by stating
that money has lost its
value. And we shall first
establish that money is a
representation of work.
The more valuable the
work done is perceived
to be, the more money it
receives as compensation.
If we have a situation
that more and more
individuals have greater
compensation for work
done, more individuals
will be able to purchase
more goods and services.
However, if the goods and
services are limited, the
demand will be greater
than the supply of goods
and services increasing
prices and hence money
would be deemed to have
lost its value. Such situa-
tions bring up comments
like “back in my day this
used to cost… but now it’s
so expensive”. That is an
example of inflation. The
same is true when we say
the goods and services
have greater perceived
value, we are referring to
the demand for goods and
services concerning the
money supply.
Some of you may have
noticed the use of the
word “perceived” in my
sentence above and the
reason is that in general
the cost associated with a
particular good or service,
logically should have gone
down with the advance-
ment in technology and
the global supply chain.
However, that is not the
case, so this must mean
that there are other factors
at play. One such factor
is the perceived value of
goods and services.
Perceived Value
It is the customers’ val-
uation of the product and
its value. For example,
a product might cost 50
pounds to manufacture,
but be sold for much more
because consumers have a
higher perceived value of
the product. If the product
was sold for less then its
perceived value; consum-
ers might not purchase it,
for fear that it is inferior.
The common scenario is
when we discuss brands
and how that adds a
premium to the product
cost. Other scenarios
worth exploring is the
cost of similar products or
products that came before
it. The logical thought
process is that with an ad-
vancement in manufactur-
ing, cost of manufacturing
has gone down, yet we see
that newer products are
more expensive. While
they might have more
complex features, but if
the cost of producing the
newer product is lower
then its predecessor, then
the factor at play is more
psychological. And it is
due to the consumers’
perceived value of the
product. Another factor
is the increase in money
supply in the market.
Money Supply
The money supply in
the market in most cases
is controlled by a central
bank. The central banks
have several instruments
to do this. First being able
to set interest rates, which
determines the cost of
borrowing. This cost of
borrowingisnotforclients
of private and commercial
banks. It is the cost of
borrowing money from
the central bank by private
and commercial banks.
And banks use this infor-
mation to set their interest
rates (usually higher)
for their clients. So why
would the banks borrow
money from the central
bank? Short answer, they
usually don’t, because
and within themselves.
The banks have what we
call an interbank rate.
Which is more favourable
then open market rates
(the rates that you and I
see when getting a loan)
but usually higher than
central bank rates. Why
do they need to borrow?
One reason is to satisfy
the reserve requirement
or reserve ratio, which we
will explore next.
Another tool central
banks use is reserve
requirement or reserve
ratio. It is the amount of
money banks must keep
as a ratio/percentage of
their total holdings. The
next question you might
have is “I thought the
bank keeps my money, so
I don’t have to stuff it in
my mattress”. Well, that’s
not the case, this is where
the magic happens. The
bank takes your money
and lends a portion of it
as loans. However, the
money that you place in
the bank, on paper, is still
in your account. This does
two things it provides an
income to banks in the
formofloansand“creates”
new money. This is where
the on-paper definition is
important. Imagine you
have 100 pounds in your
bank account. Now what
happens, is your bank
will take a portion of that
according to the reserve
requirement and loan
it out. And it loans out
90 pounds. The person
it loans the 90 pounds
to, places that money
in their bank account.
Now assuming that both
accounts are held by the
bank. The bank has a total
of 190 pounds on paper
in its holdings. And with
that, the bank takes that
190 pounds and loans
out a portion of that. This
process becomes a cycle
and “creates” money. And
the bank has a growth in
the amount of money on
paper in its holdings and
the money supply in the
economy increases. At
the same time, it creates
multiple streams of
income through multiple
loans.Thebanks,however,
must ensure that it must
physically have money
in its vaults to satisfy the
reserve requirements.
When the loans are paid,
the money is “destroyed”;
not actually because it
was credit (debt) to being
with, i.e. it did not exist.
The money supply would
then decrease. You will
notice that banks pay you
a small interest rate to
keep the money in your
account and that most
likely comes from the
revenue generated from
the loans they issued and
it is an incentive to keep
your money with the bank.
Take note
Different systems
manage the money supply,
like in the European Union
for example, which has a
system of multiple central
banks and the American
Federal Reserve (FED)
and the treasury. The FED
has recently decreased its
rate, making it cheaper to
borrow and introducing
more money (in the form
of credit) into the market
to stimulate the economy,
amidst the coronavirus
outbreak around the
world.
The reserve require-
“If the product
was sold for
less then its
perceived
value;
consumers
might not
purchase it, for
fear that it is
inferior”
ment is not something
central banks typically
change, but it is done in
China by the People’s
Bank of China (China’s
central bank), to control
its money supply. And
if you read my earlier ar
ticle on trade, I briefly
touched on why some
currencies are worth more
than others. (hint: it’s
demand and supply but
with the desired currency
as the good that you are
buying with your coun-
try’s currency).
Further readings
Consumer price index
(CPI), is the weighted
average of prices of
consumer goods and
services and it is used in
the calculation of infla-
“I thought the
bank keeps
my money, so
I don’t have to
stuff it in my
mattress [...]
The bank takes
your money
and lends a
portion of it as
loans”
“The reserve
requirement is
not something
central banks
typically
change, but
it is done in
China by the
People’s Bank
of China”
it implies that they are
facing financal difficulty
and might lead to an in-
vestigation into the bank.
In the event they require
money, the banks would
borrow from each other
“The banks,
however,
must ensure
that it must
physically
have money
in its vaults
to satisfy
the reserve
requirements”
tion. Arguably not the best
measure of inflation on an
induvial level, due to dif-
ferent consumer spending
habits. For example, if
the products you have
been purchasing has not
gone up in price for years
compared to someone else
who has seen an increase
in cost for their purchases.
Then one could almost
say that inflation is differ-
ent for you as compared to
someone else.
