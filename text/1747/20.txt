W
ho was
C r i s t ó b a l
Balenciaga?
He was
born to José Balenciaga,
a simple fisherman, and
to Martina Eizaguirre, a
humble seamstress, in the
medieval Basque village
of Getaria as the 19th
century came to a close.
Yet upon his death in
1972, when headlines
lamented the death
of a ‘king’, there was
no doubt about whom
they were referring to.
His childhood was
spent far from the glam-
orous sartorial worlds of
Paris and Madrid, beneath
the red rooftop tiles of the
stone houses that paved
the narrow alleys which
lookedouttowardsthesea.
His father died in his
early childhood and it was
his mother’s world that he
inherited whilst growing
up listening to the repet-
itive drill of her sewing
machine. Throughout
his early years they
worked tirelessly and
rigorously alongside to
repair, alter and trans-
form the garments of
his mother’s aristocratic
clients, whose wardrobes
were in constant need
of up-keep to reflect the
latest fashions. Amongst
them was the Marquesa
de Casa Torres, a noble-
woman renowned for
her beauty and exquisite
taste who owned a villa
in Getaria (now the
Balenciaga Museum).
She allowed Balencia-
ga to visit her every day
after school to examine
her extensive wardrobe
stocked with elegant
dresses brought back from
her regular trips to Paris.
Fascinated by what he
saw, the precocious child
boasted that he could
make her a dress as beauti-
ful if the Marquesa would
supply him with the proper
tools and materials: the
result did not disappoint
and was worn to mass the
following week. When
he was barely 12 years
old the wealthy patroness
sent him to San Sebastián
to obtain formal training
from a reputed tailor,
and thanks to her insight
Balenciaga’s vision was
realised in the world.
Far removed from the
reality of his everyday
life, the villa was more
like a palace; and it
was an opening into an
aristocratic world of an
artistic refinement and so-
phistication which he oth-
erwise could never have
accessed. The Marquesa
and the Marqués were
art collectors, exposing
the young Cristóbal to
paintings by Spanish
masters such as Goya,
Velázquez, and El Greco.
These became impressed
onto his mind and later,
into his works, which not
only borrowed from the
ruched dresses and beaded
boleros of flamenco
dancers but directly inher-
ited their grace and purity
of line. The engravings,
catalogues, photographs
and history books brought
back from the Marquesa’s
European travels formed
much of his education.
Ten years later in 1917,
he established his own
couture house, capitalis-
ing as did many fashion
designers of the time on
the escapist and self-in-
dulgent consumerist
mood of the post-war era.
Yet Balenciaga disliked
the frivolous side of
fashion and society life.
The atmosphere at his
fashion shows was one of
religious reverence as aus-
tere-faced models walked
up and down in silence,
indifferent to the whisper-
ing audience and its pro-
longed applause, whilst he
discreetly observed from
a hole in the curtains.
By the 1950s, a ver-
itable cult had amassed
around the enigmatic
Balenciaga, whose clients
ranged from Grace Kelly
to Greta Garbo. Women
were addicted to his
designs, curtseyed to
him as to royalty and
wished to be buried in
Balenciaga. The clothes
themselves were volup-
tuous and enabled ease
of movement, flattered
every figure and were
always grand. Above all
his designs transfigured
Spanish style whilst main-
taining its essence. Tra-
ditional colour codes like
cardinal red, saintly white,
and the sober black of the
Spanish court were turned
on their heads to produce
fashionable gowns; from
the sequins and lace of
the matadors to the crin-
olined and silk-layered
gowns of society ladies,
his imagination freely
adapted and merged
historical elements with
more Western styles to
produce, in a way, a mod-
ernist sartorial re-imag-
ining of Spanish identity.
Although the Spanish
civil war forced him to es-
tablish his career in Paris,
he never forgot Geratia
and his mother’s sewing
machine, which he kept
exhibited in his living
room in a spot overlooked

Style - A personal narrative
S
u b c o n s c i o u s l y
when I was
younger, and con-
sciously now, the
first thing I observe when
I meet someone is their
outfit. I remember telling
my mum when I’d get
back home from school
which of my teachers in
kindergarten were the best
dressed, and that would be
the deciding factor of who
my favourite teacher was.
In the years that fol-
lowed, I spent ages choos-
ing my outfit before go-
ing out, regardless of the
magnitude of the occa-
sion. Every summer be-
fore the start of term, it
was of utmost importance
to me that my uniform
was well ironed, my clean
white socks were of the
right length and my black
shoes were stylish and up
to the latest trend. I went
through black adidas run-
ning shoes, converse, con-
verse high tops, and ballet
flats. My outfit narrated
my story; the parts of my
appearance I cared about
and respecting myself
enough to put effort into
making myself presenta-
ble. Having grown up in
an international school
with people of all back-
grounds, I’d see brands
from Balenciaga to Gucci.
I almost felt obligated to
style myself well enough
such that I didn’t need a
brand to speak for me.
However, my appre-
ciation for diverse style
and everyone’s rep-
resentation of themselves
through their outfits only
came after I saw a post
Instagram about how
we shouldn’t judge an-
other person’s outfit. We
might not know how the
clothes someone choses
to wear might represent
parts of them that we do
not know about, therefore
we are in no position to
make a judgment about it.
This interested me be-
cause as a person who
cares so much about how
I present myself, it was
hard to fathom the com-
plexities behind every
individual’s stylistic
choices, especially ones
that did not appeal to me.
Upon further ponder-
ing, it dawned on me
that style is more than
the trendy boots and the
crisp trench coats we
see all around London.
If an individual were to
wear designer clothing,
it shouldn’t be interpret-
ed that they come from a
rich background with ex-
pensive style. Likewise, a
particularly jarring com-
bination of colours does
not speak to their inability
to match colour palettes
and lack of stylishness.
Style lies in the jeans
that people have owned
for years or the worn out
sneakers that have a charm
of their own. Style isn’t
the oversized tee one is
wearing, simply because
that is the current fad, but
the old sweater that has
been stretched out because
it holds sentimental value
and comes from a loved
one. Style isn’t material-
istic. Style is channeling
outfits that represent one’s
comfort, confidence, and
charisma. I believe that is
what makes style eternal,
as comfort, confidence,
and charisma hold dif-
ferent value and mean-
ing in everyone’s lives.
So now as I contin-
ue to observe everyone’s
outfits, I do it to learn a
little more about the hid-
den details in their story.
