MTSoc: Footloose
Dancing is banned but cringe high school clichés are most definitely allowed!
T
erm is coming
to a close,
exams are
impending, so
this is naturally the
perfect time for a bunch
of students to put on a
production of the hit
musical Footloose!
With amazing singing
and some impressive
choreography, I can only
imagine the number of
hours of Panopto they
now have to catch up on!
The plot was a little
lacklustre, I would
go as far as saying
it was non-existent.
Basically, city boy Ren
McCormack (Harrison
Goldspink) moves
to the small town of
Bomont where dancing
is banned! He fights
back against the powers
that be, most notably
Reverend Shaw Moore
(Mark Lord). With the
town’s young people on
his side, the tides even-
tually turn. The classic
themes of small town
American high school
drama run throughout
the play. This is not
exactly something we
can all relate to as Lon-
doners, where the only
thing that is banned is
talking on the tube.
The opening number
seemed a bit shaky
and could have used a
little more work but the
quality increased expo-
nentially with “Learning
To Be Silent”, per-
formed by Oishi Sikdar,
Camelia Richards and
Nadya Moore, being
the highlight of the
whole show for me. This
girl power ballad saw
Richards cement herself
as the hidden talent in
this production. Despite
not always taking centre
stage, she captured
every pair of eyes in the
audience with each note
she sang.
On top of all these
momentous musical
moments, there were
some scenes that had the
audience laughing out
loud! Betty Blast (Tash
Cowan), the owner of
the diner, probably got
the biggest laugh during
her brief roller-skating
cameo. However, it was
the country bumpkin
Willard Hewit (Sam Lee)
who was consistently
the funniest character.
The way Lee brought
the odd character to life
was a joy to watch and
really had the audience
emotionally invested
while also crying with
laughter.
Finally, the leads,
played by Goldspink
and Moore, were very
impressive. During her
rendition of “Holding
Out For A Hero”, Moore
was given the chance to
really shine and display
her undeniably amazing
voice. This is a song that
the audience had most
definitely heard before
but I’m sure many
would now pick Moore’s
version as their favour-
ite! Ren was probably
the hardest character
to undertake. From the
comedic moments to
emotional monologues,
this role required a huge
acting range. Thank-
fully,Goldspink rose to
this challenge and gave
an all-around strong
performance.
The show had a simple
set which was vaguely
effective at transporting
the characters around
the small town, from
the high school to the
church to the diner and
back home. There was a
big black block right in
the center of the stage
which could have acted
as the perfect blank
canvas to bring the set
to a new level by adding
a bit of colour!
Footloose is a show
all about how dancing
can bring joy, yet a
few of the performers
didn’t seem all that
joyous when busting a
move. While most were
confidently selling the
musical theatre fantasy,
some didn’t seem to be
committing to the moves
and brought down the
rest of the group. This
is such a small thing
to fix but would really
elevate the whole show
and bring the ensemble
dancing onto the same
level as the amazing
singing. Overall this
is another great per-
formance from MTSoc
with some real talent on
show!
