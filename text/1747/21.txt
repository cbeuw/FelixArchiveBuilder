Tycho Takes Us Back a Decade
Tycho’s latest effort is a return to an earlier style; but one that lacks the originality and impetus of prior work
C
reating a sense
of space in
music is hard.
Music itself
doesn’t really correlate
to any physical space as
such. Mozart might make
you dream of Salzburg or
some Viennese ballroom;
Pink Floyd might be able
to make you feel like
you’re sitting behind a
spartan bench of an old
English school. Many
of these notions come
from powerful cultural
crosslinks, a mesh of
references to which there
is no end. But what if
you are presented with a
piece of music only – no
cultural lexicon, no lyrics,
no image to guide you?
Creating a beautiful
soundscape – one which
you can fully immerse
yourself in – is what
ambient electronic music
aims to do. It goes beyond
the total recall of refer-
ential work and aims to
create something new.
It is sound design at its
purest. The sonic building
blocks must be perfect.
The totality of the whole
must be convincing, else
the aim of the exercise has
been defeated. With his
newest effort, Simulcast,
forty-three-year-old Cal-
ifornian producer Tycho
has gone back to ambient
basics, letting go of the
vocals he unprecedentedly
introduced on his previous
album. The question on
everyone’s lips is whether
this represents a return
to form or whether this
short, thirty-five-minute
album is a somewhat lazy,
uber-chill version of its
predecessor. Is there more
to explore in the universe
of his music?
The American’s work
is difficult to pin down
to a genre. It is quintes-
sentially electronic, using
both digital and analogue
synthesisers heavily.
On the other hand, his
no-nonsense percussion
borrows heavily from
rock, as do the variedly
distorted guitars which
carry a hefty portion of
the melodic load. Overall,
the influence of the early
work of Scottish ambient
maestros Boards of
Canada cannot be over-
looked. With a sprightlier
sound than the brothers
from north Britannia,
Tycho sounds as though
their music travelled to
San Francisco and got a

tan. This might make his
sound more appealing, but
it also makes it blander.
Many accuse Tycho
of making spruced up
background music for the
YouTube generation.
The compositional
aspects of great ambient
are all there – the elements
whooshing from ear to ear,
the strange, and at points
almost inaudible, samples
from obscure VHS tapes,
and the ephemeral synths
which sound like they’re
coming from millions of
miles away, inviting you
to step into his world.
The entry point of
Simulcast is the closing
song from the old album,
Weather. Like many of
the songs on the new
album, it is a reworked,
instrumental version of
its counterpart from the
previous. Despite the
Grammy nomination for
Weather, many fans felt
that the album was a de-
parture from the original
Tycho sound. Simulcast
is supposed to reverse
that trend and offer up
something closer to his
Dive trilogy.
That is certainly some-
thing he’s been able to
do. The production is un-
mistakably Tycho: cool,
comforting and clean.
It is exactly the kind of
record you would want to
listen to on a sunlit walk
through the park, early on
a Sunday morning when
no one is there. It offers
serenity, can serve as a
backdrop to introspection,
and can be mindfully
shooed away by more
important thoughts. It is
what you want it to be. It
does not impose.
To say that Simulcast
is soulless would be diffi-
cult. That would mean all
of his music is soulless. It
is also not possible to say
that it is not technically
good. The arrangement
is impeccable, the
melodies are thoroughly
thought-out, and the mix
is perfect. What must be
said, though, is that it
seems drained. Drained of
colour, drained of original
elements, and lacking an
element of surprise.
Tycho’s sonic universe
is like a memory palace
full of wonder. Every
object is placed with preci-
sion, shade and light play
together to make you feel
at ease. It is like a home
beach on the moon: alien
but comfortable. There are
highlights on the album
which almost go so far as
to add a new dimension to
the place. Outer Sunset,
Into the Woods and Easy
form the core of the album
and make for an excellent
listening experience. So
much of the rest of the
songs can’t help but bleed
into the background.
According to the
litmus test of ambient
music outlined at the
start, I would have to
reject Simulcast as a great
ambient album. If the
cover art of the album,
the California cliffs,
epitomise the scenes he is
trying to conjure up, then
the act of listening to him
repeatedly is like driving
a red cabrio on the roads
atop them every day. With
each passing drive, the
beautiful scenery imprints
itself ever more on your
memory. Even after a
decade of driving down it
every day, when prompted
you can convince
someone of its beauty.
Nevertheless, it becomes
something too familiar. It
begins to fade away. Into
the background.
