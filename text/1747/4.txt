Editor’s note: in the in-
terest of protecting private
medical information for
individuals, this article
has been ‘anonymised’.
This is, speaking person-
ally, a time for the com-
munity to remain calm
and to follow the science
rather than succumb to
any reactionary behav-
iour. If you've come into
contact with someone
with the virus, please do
follow the NHS guide-
lines - the risk to most of
us is small, but the risk
to others with underlying
health problems is much
higher. Detailed advice is
available from the College
at https://www.imperial.

students and for staff.
U
pwards of
a hundred
I m p e r i a l
students have
had to isolate them-
selves due to potential
exposure to coronavirus.
The largest potential
exposure follows a society
party last week, at which
an attending alumnus was
later tested positive for
the virus. The alumnus
had reportedly already
been tested, but had not
yet heard back results.
As a result, every student
in attendance at the event
has been self-isolated,
after the alumnus mass-
emailed attendees the
following day.
The College has, as
of yesterday, confirmed
that there are no cases yet
of coronavirus amongst
the Imperial community
itself. They have also
issued a stern warning that
disciplinary action may
follow for any student
found sharing the personal
medical details of another.
Students in self-isola-
tion have been encour-
aged to stay at home,
and to get in contact with
their Senior Tutors via a
dedicated Imperial email

The Times Launches Second Red Box Competition
F
or the second

an Imperial-only

competition, the prize for

to submit mitigating
circumstances forms
for any resulting missed
coursework. Other than
that, there has – accord-
ing to one self-isolated
student – been no direct
contact from the College
to affected students.
Students at the
College are increasingly
concerned about the effect
the virus may have on
examinations and large
coursework deadlines.
However, the College has
insisted that no exams will
be cancelled “unless the
government takes meas-
ures that would make
this impossible”, such as
banning large gatherings
or mandating schools and
universities to close. This
is in contrast to various
other institutions across
the globe, with several
UK and Irish schools
closing completely – and
a slew of announcements
of university closures in
the US and international-
ly. The College has also
said that, unless already
planned, no exams will be
run online instead.
Similarly, the College
will not be cancelling
any large-scale events
unless banned by gov-
ernment. However, some

Red Box column
podcast alongside Matt
Chorley, the editor of Red
Box.
The essay topic en-
courages students to write
about how government
can get citizens to change
their behaviour, for either
the health of themselves
and their nation or of
the environment. Sub-
missions are limited to
500 words, and must be
submitted by the 30th of
April.
The competition is
an ongoing part of the
College’s partnership
with The Times, which
additionally provides
students and staff with
a free subscription each
year.
Last year’s winner,
Joanna Wormald,
then-Deputy Editor for
Felix, wrote on multiple
topics for the column – in-
cluding why cabinet min-
isters should have training
before taking office, and
how protest is used to
preserve hope rather than
to force change. Speaking
to Felix, she said:
“Finding out that I'd
be given the opportunity
to write for Red Box - to
have a national platform
at the age of 20, less than
two years after qualifying
as a journalist - was
surreal. It's been part of
my morning routine for
years and opening the
email to see my byline
next to my words was
such a proud moment.
I may or may not have
stayed up until midnight,
refreshing the Times'
website (spoiler alert: I
did). When I write about
politics, I naturally make
a lot of wry comments and
that comedic bent is the
reason I first subscribed
to Red Box. It definitely
opened doors for me - I
was getting paid freelance
work within weeks. I
really cannot recommend
it enough.”

events have already been
cancelled due to a lack
of willingness or ability
to travel and participate
from speakers.
No specific plans have
been outlined for dealing
with the potentially large
number of students who
cannot safely attend
exams or complete major
coursework – however,
the College has said it will
continuously update the
situation via its website,
where a specialised
webpage has been set up
to address concerns about
COVID-19. The webpage
also contains advice for
current and prospective
students who may be
affected by the virus, such
as international students
who cannot complete
English-language tests
that are required for entry
to the College.
