Upcoming Games of March and April: Felix Games

approaching, I have one
thing on my mind: games!
March and April are
packed with a hot pot of
amazing games to dive
into, so I have put together
a list of what I think are
the biggest and best to
look forward to!
Pokémon Mystery Dun-
geon Rescue Team DX
March 6th
Switch
A remake of the
beloved GBA and DS
games, already released
and I can say that it is a
banger. The original game
was so good, exploring
dungeons from floor to
floor, recruiting Pokémon
on your way and delving
deep into the surprisingly
rich story. The remake
only elevates the original
game with a hand-drawn
artstyle and the choice
between a handheld or big
screen experience.
Ori and the Will of the
Wisps
March 11th
Xbox One, PC
The sequel to one of the
most creative Xbox games
in a while, Will of the
Wisps looks to be as beau-
tiful and full of wonder as
the original. There looks
to be an equally engross-
ing plot this time around,
with amazing platforming
gameplay. The objective
is the same as last time
around, find the key and
open the doors, but with
the addition of boss fights
this time around, it looks
as though a breath of fresh
air has been blown over
Ori… not like it needed it
though!
Nioh 2
March 13th
PS4
Sequel to the surprise
hit Nioh in early 2017,
Nioh 2 looks to be just
as challenging and just
as rewarding as the first.
With new powerful Yo-kai
abilities and the ability to
summon NPCs to help you
in a fight. From previews
available, it looks like the
bosses this time round are
monstrous. Nioh 2 adds
new abilities and options
to the player, but with a
corresponding difficulty
spike, any player that
beats the game should
feel an amazing sense of
accomplishment.
MLB the Show 20
March 17th
PS4
Baseball! While not the
most popular sport in the
U.K., MLB the Show is
a long running franchise
(soontoloseitsPlaystation
exclusivity) that makes
the game of baseball
interesting to both play
and watch. If you ever
player Wii Sports baseball
and thought ‘Damn I wish
this was more realistic’,
then here is the game for
you! With new gameplay
mechanics increasing the
balance between different
playable sportsmen, the
game has become much
more dynamic than in
previous years. Also, for
the first time, there is the
ability to play both Major
league and Minor league
sportsmen, meaning the
pool of players you can
choose from is bigger than
ever!
Animal Crossing: New
Horizons
March 20th
Switch
Finally, the wait is
almost over. Animal
Crossing is a beloved
franchise by many. You
play a little bit every day,
slowly building up your
town and increasing your
collections of bugs, fish
and fossils. It is simple yet
charming and addictive,
and the Switch addition
of the franchise looks to
really bring things up a
notch. In New Horizons,
you play as a character
on the Tom Nook Island
Getaway Package. With
free roam around a
dessert island that you
can customise at your will
(seriously you can liter-
ally terraform the entire
island) there is more room
to show your creativity
than ever. Nintendo has
said that they are planning
events all year round,
meaning this is going to
be a game that you will
find yourself coming
back to time and time
again. Definitely worth
the full price to me, I will
be picking it up and for
anyone who has a Switch
but never has enough time
to dedicate hours a day to
it, I recommend that you
do the same!
DOOM Eternal
March 20th
Everything (Switch date
TBC)
Coming out on the
same day as Animal
Crossing, the absolute an-
tithesis of the furry friend
surrounded life simulator
is DOOM eternal, a
game where you blow up
demons. If DOOM 2016
was anyone to go off,
DOOM eternal should
absolutely knock it out
of the part. High octane
gameplay, with dynamic
combat implementing a
wide array of weapons
against an equally diverse
group of enemies, DOOM
constantly keeps the heart
rate up whilst at the same
time making you feel
like a complete badass.
With double the amount
of gameplay as the first,
and hopefully double
the amount of gore, let’s
hope Bethesda doesn’t
pull a Fallout 76, and
really gives us something
good here. A nice relaxing
break from the stress of
paying back a loan in
Animal Crossing later this
month.
Half-Life Alyx
March 23rd
PC
WHAT??? HALF-
LIFE 3 CONFIRMED???
Unfortunately, no. But
here is the next best thing,
a completely new half-
life game in VR made by
valve! This is looking to
truly evolve the state of
VR games in the modern
day, being a complete
first-person shooter
game that both looks and
sounds just like half-life.
Instead of a gravity gun,
you instead have a gravity
glove that allows for
manipulation of various
objects throughout the
world. One way in which
valve has looked to deal
with movement in a VR
world to prevent motion
sickness is to give the
option to active teleport
to points in front of you
rather than having to walk
there. This is a nice choice
for anyone that may get
sick after playing VR for
too long. It does seem to
be a slower paced half-life
game than fans are used
to, but every location
looks so full to the brim
of reasons to explore that
it is absolutely worth the
sacrifice of pace.
Persona 5 Royal
March 31st
PS4
Effectively a re-release
of Persona 5, but with
much, much more content
added, Persona 5 Royal is
a must buy for anyone that
is interested in the game
but has yet to take the
leap of faith and buy it. In
one of the quintessential
RPG experiences of last
decade, you take control
of a high-school student,
codenamed Joker who
(among others) forms the
Phantom Theives, a group
with the aim of stealing
corruption from adults
to help reform a broken
city. Royal looks to add
significantly to the story,
such that it acts almost as
a sequel. I don’t want to
spoil too much so all I will
say is if you have been
looking for a good RPG to
play, get this, please.
Resident Evil 3
April 3rd
PS4, PC, Xbox One
A remake of Resident
Evil 3 from 1999, this third
Ori and the Will of the Wisps looks as breathtakingly gorgeous as its predecessor // Moon Studios
