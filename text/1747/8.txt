Kyoto to Catwalk
K
imono: the
Japanese word
t r a n s l a t e s
simply as ‘thing
to wear’, so ingrained is
the kimono in Japanese
culture. Yet, from its ori-
gins in Edo-period Japan,
this simple garment has
travelled all around the
world. The V&A’s new
exhibition – the first major
exhibition on kimono
in Europe – provides a
unique perspective on its
global evolution, covering
a journey of almost four
hundred years.
Walking in, we are
greeted by a display
cabinet holding three
kimono. A closer look
reveals the startling fact
that they are from three
very different eras and
approaches: a traditional
Japanese kimono from the
17th century, a Dior haute
couture outfit from the
2000s, and a modern-tra-
ditional Japanese design
from today. Remarkably,
all are unmistakably
kimono; one can see how
the kimono has fluidly
adapted to the changing
world while remaining
unchanged at its core.
The rest of the exhi-
bition is structured along
the three major themes
from the first display. We
begin at the origins of the
kimono in 17th-century
Edo Japan, the romantic
‘floating world’ where
samurai ruled, kabuki
theatre flourished, and
streets were filled with
beautiful geishas in ex-
travagant kimono. Such
is the world depicted in
the ukiyo-e woodblock
prints and painted screens,
which hang alongside
a dazzling array of
Edo-period kimono. The
extensive display explores
the changing tastes in
Edo-period fashion over
two hundred years. Much
as today, celebrities and
actors were trendsetters;
people scrambled to buy
the ‘Ichimatsu check’
pattern after the kabuki
actor Sanogawa Ichi-
matsu wore it on stage.
With willing consumers
foreign trade in the 1850s.
The trend was part of a
wider public fascination
with ‘the exotic Orient’ –
one that saw the creation
of several Japanese-in-
spired operas and plays
such as ‘The Mikado’ and
‘The Geisha’. Courtesy
of the Dutch East India
Company (DEIC),
Japanese kimono-makers
produced quilted kimonos
and belted ‘dressing
gowns’ specifically
for export to Europe.
A traditional kimono
could be adapted into a
European dress by adding
a triangle of fabric to
create a full skirt, with the
traditional obi becoming
a figure-hugging sash.
Portraits and fashion
plates from the period
certainly speak to the pop-
ularity of Japanese-style
dress among wealthy
Victorians. Is this cultural
appropriation at its finest?
The exhibition is quick to
point out that the cultural
influence was not uni-
directional. When cloth
from India was brought by
the DEIC to Japan to be
made into kimonos, these
Indian patterns became
fashionable in Japan itself,
with Japanese weavers
adopting Indian textile
designs (wa-sarasa).
European dress styles and
European ideals became
popular in Japan with
increasing foreign travel
and imports.An intriguing
painting from 1935 shows
a young woman dressed
in an elegant kimono…
with a fox pelt draped
incongruously around her
neck. This period seems
to reflect more a dialogue
between two cultures than
simple ‘appropriation’.
Bringing us up to speed
with the modern day, the
wide-ranging final section
covers the diverse range
of forms and roles taken
on by the kimono today.
In modern haute couture,
its elegance and clean
lines have inspired both
Japanese and non-Japa-
nese designers alike, from
Alexander McQueen to
Rei Kawakubo, who have
each re-interpreted the
classic form. In music and
film, the kimono has also
found its way to inspire
artists: on display is the
original costume worn by
Obi-Wan Kenobi as well
as Björk’s ‘multicultural
goddess’ outfit in her
album cover for Homoge-
nic. In Japan, it remains a
potent symbol of tradition
and identity. However, far
from being the everyday
attire they were in the
Edo period, kimono are
now generally worn in
Japan only on a handful
of formal or traditional
occasions. It is a little sad
that these occasions are
so infrequent that profes-
sional ‘kimono-fitters’ are
needed to teach people
how to wear kimonos
properly. But we end on a
hopeful note, with an array
of contemporary kimono
and even a photo of a
teenage girl in Harajuku
turning a vintage kimono
into street fashion.
My only complaint is
that the exhibition is fairly
static – by this time the
sheer number of kimono
passing before my eyes
have somewhat melded
into one. I can’t help but
wish for some more inno-
vative ways of telling the
tale, whether it be through
more interactivity in the
exhibits or perhaps more
videos in addition to the
text descriptions.
Nonetheless, this
exhibition provides a
comprehensive and fasci-
nating perspective on the
evolution of the kimono
through time. A decep-
tively simple garment
(pleasingly mathematical
in construction), it is ev-
er-changing in the forms
it takes while retaining its
quintessential elegance
and beauty.

fed by the media craze
of woodblock printing
(the tabloids of the day),
kimono fashion flourished
and became ever more
elaborate. I envy whichev-

the gorgeous sky-blue
kimono embroidered
with golden sparrows and
snowy bamboo, but most
striking of all is a stark
black kimono decorated
in a pattern of skulls

modern for the 1800s.
