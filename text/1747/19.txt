T
he only place
more diverse than
Clapham’s high
street on Tuesday
night was The Grand,
where ICSM RAG held
their annual fashion show.
After a ten-year run of the
annual show, the pressure
was on to keep the show
feeling fresh and to raise
as much money as possi-
ble for the selected RAG
charities: Hammersmith
and Fulham Foodbank
and the Sci Foundation.
The show entitled “Come
As You Are” drew inspira-
tion from positive changes
in the fashion industry’s
towards more inclusivity
and more diversity. This
was reflected in the shows
impressive casting of
over 50 models who each
brought their own unique
personality and style to
the catwalk. Perfectly
reflecting the imperative
set out in the show’s title.
The show’s opening
walks set the tone for
the evening. It featured
Edge of Beyond, a
London-based body
inclusive lingerie brand
who incorporate 24 karat
jewellery into their pieces.
The styling utilised
semi-transparent sheer
t-shirts which were ripped
off as part of the explosive
choreography to revel
the intricately made sus-
penders, bras and thongs
adorned with jewels and
sequins. This moment saw
an eruption of cheers from
the crowd. Cheers which
would keep on coming for
the remainder of the show.
The second walk saw
male and female models
come together on the
stage in reworked denim
and streetwear pieces The boys in Master Debonair // Zoha Imam
from Pieces*. The most
striking items included
asymmetrical paint drip
jeans in black and gold, an
updated and exciting take
on the Junya Wantanbe
classic. The closing walk
for the opening section
of the show saw a sig-
nificant mood change.
Models were carried on
to the stage in low light to
epic atmospheric music.
When the lights went up
garments from Charlotte
Piers. The range of lycra
two piece sets with lava,
sunset and asymmetrical
block colour patterns
filled the crowd with
excitement and energy for
summer, the end of exams
and festival season.
A brief interval saw
only a slight relent in
the excitement from the
crowd as they headed
to the bar to refresh and
recover from the realness.
Following this, it was
straight back in with the
boys looking sharp in
Master Debonair. The
award-winning menswear
brand showed a range of
fitted three-piece suits
with coordinated pocket
squares and ties. Although
this collection did little
reinvention, aside from
the double-breasted
waistcoats; the walk was
kept interesting with tight
boy-band choreography
with an unexpected song
switch to Billie Eilish’s
‘Bad Guy’. The next walk
was exactly the opposite.
Demoo Jeans showed
a range of sustainable
up-cycled jeans in all cuts:
flared, straight and low
waisted. These were cus-
tomised with sequin and
embroidery detailing at
the cuffs styled and styled
with matching headbands.
The result was looks
which straddled 70s disco
fever and 2000s denim
obsession. After this, a
walk with clothes from
Jaspreet Layal showed
a range of satin trouser
suits, dresses, tops and
skirts adorned with metal
floral detailing. Before the
mid-way interval, it was
time for the swimwear
walk. Oceanus swimsuits
with their geometric
patterns, floral embroi-
dery and asymmetrical
shapes glowed underneath
UV lights. The impressive
sequin illustration of a
cobra on the one of the
swimsuits made this
a stand-out piece. For
the boys, Pink House
Mustique showed classic
Californian boardshorts.
Ending the swimwear
walk pool inflatables were
launched into the crowd
which would circulate
around the audience
and the catwalk for the
remainder of the evening.
Finally, the fourth-year
walk continued the beach-
wear vibe with clothes
from Tom’s Trunks. The
baggy cotton loungewear
looked ideal for long
library shifts, long-haul
flights, and long lazy
Sundays.
The break was accom-
panied by a performance
from Jazz Band, but the
choreographers didn’t let
the crowd take a breath.
For the final song, we saw
four male models wearing
bow ties and not much else
join the vocalist on stage
from some impressive
lifts and classy choreog-
raphy. When we returned,
the impressive choreog-
raphy kept coming with a
voguing inspired routine
for male models in heels
and garments An Original
Leroy. The tight neon
spandex pants laden with
animal prints accompa-
nied the brilliant routine
perfectly. Following that,
we had a sensational
collection from Kath-
erine J.W. who showed
windbreakers, bodysuits
and other sportswear
reworked to include
nautical elements and
colours. These included
prints of sailing maps,
safety orange lifejacket
straps and laser cut acrylic
necklaces, all inspired
by her Grandfathers
old sailing gear. Before
Bhangra took to the
stage for a high-energy
dance interval, we saw
El Velvet’s collection of
bold street and sportswear
staples.
Following the interval,
models were shown in
Clara Buchen’s womens-
wear which combined
bright colours and
neutral tones effortlessly
into a sustainable collec-
tion. The combination
of a cropped hot pink
jacket and pale pink skirt
defied logic to produce
a truly refreshing look.
This was followed by
an equally impressive
sustainable streetwear
collection from OKT,
which combined
Korean oversizing with
London style codes. The
outstanding finishing,
shape and detailing of
the garments kept this
collection individual in
an otherwise saturated
streetwear scene. After-
wards, the hosts for the
evening’s kept their cool
and the crowd laughing
through an awkward
raffle mishap, in an oth-
erwise flawless running
of the night, before it was
time for closing lingerie
and final walk. The
inclusivity and diversity
of Bluebella’s luxury
lingerie was used to the
fullest. All the lingerie
items you would expect
to see were updated with
harnesses, straps and lace
detailing. Accompany-
ing this was underwear
designer Bocka Bocka,
which boxers and briefs
featured brightly coloured
neon prints.
Closing out the show
was, of course, the final
walkwhichfeaturedallthe
models coming as they are
to the end of the catwalk
for one final time to give
us hilarious and personal
poses to end the show.
After the audience’s long
applause and the confetti
finished falling, I spoke to
one of the show’s Creative
Directors, Teresa Lau. She
summed up what the show
meant to her and the team
behind it saying “All of
the hard work [had] paid
off to see an audience so
excited about welcoming
in a new decade where
individuality, inclusivity
and diversity are set to be
centre stage.”
