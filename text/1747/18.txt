London Fashion
Week has finally
sizzled over, but
don’t you worry. London
Bridal Fashion Week is
just around the corner and
it’s only fair we dedicate
an article to the glorious
creations that were once
featured in almost every
girl’s dream. While the
female to male ratio at
Imperial is unfortunate,
international women’s
day was just a week ago
and this article is for the
ladies that have yet to say
yes to the dress.
Let’s delve into a
little history of wedding
dresses. Today we see
wedding dresses as a
symbol of love and
commitment and to all
the to-be brides out there,
the most beautiful piece
of overpriced garment
for the supposedly most
special day of your life.

Let’s take a walk down the memory lane of bridal fashion.

With the increasing
variety in materials,
colours and silhouettes,
brides worldwide gather
an entourage of brides-
maids and spends weeks
if not months searching
for the one perfect dress.
But in early bridal
history, wedding dresses
were merely a symbol of
a business transaction,
signifying the wealth and
status of two newly allied
families. In fact, wedding
dresses were rarely the
extravagant bouquet of
personalised white fabric
we know today, but
rather the finest existing
dress in the closet. While
contemporary non-white
dresses are likely worn
to make a statement,
dark-coloured wedding
dresses were the norm in
the earliest ceremonies.
It was not until 1849
that Godey’s Lady Book,
a women’s magazine at
the time, declared white
as “the most fitting hue”
for all things bridal. In
addition to signifying
innocence and purity,
white fabric was the most
difficult to procure and
preserve. A bride dressed
in an intricate white gown
was the perfect declaration
of social status and wealth.
Fashion and history
go hand in hand. Just
like the how changing
social dynamics underlie
the evolution from con-
servative hemlines to
audacious flapper fashion,
bridal fashion evolved
along with historical cir-
cumstances that affected
the economy and availa-
bility of precious fabrics.
When the great depres-
sion hit, decreasing dis-
posable income meant any
remaining pennies would
not be spent on dresses
that are only to be worn
once and ordinary dresses
sufficed once more. Soon,
the beginning of World
War II compelled young
loved ones and newly
enlisted men to rush to
the alter. Along with the
effects of rationing and
scare resources, wartime
bridal fashion was not
only non-traditional but
involved a decent amount
of creativity. While most
made do with available
fabrics and modest
designs, women with
their minds set on a white
dress engaged in creative
efforts to repurpose
remnants of silk para-
chutes that safely returned
with their grooms-to-be.
As the economy
recovered, luxurious
white dressed resurfaced
once more. We owe it
to designers of the time
that fairy-tale-worthy
gowns of Grace Kelly,
Audrey Hepburn and
Princess Diana graced
this earth. These iconic
dresses remain as some
of the most remembered
designs of all time.
Back to modern day, ce-
lebrity and royal wedding
dresses still make the
headlines without fail
every year. Whether
marriage is your ‘thing’ or
not, bridal fashion is here
to stay and flourish. We
are very much blessed to
be born in an age of peace
when bridal designers can
play fairy god mother and
little girls can dream of
being married in “nothing
but custom Vera Wang”.
Finally, as a public
service announcement
to the few bridal fashion
enthusiasts out there.
London bridal fashion
week is happening from
March 22nd to 24th just
as Easter break begins.
Words cannot capture the
elegance and intricacy
of wedding dresses, so
I will leave it to you to
admire them yourself.
