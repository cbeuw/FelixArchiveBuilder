My Week Off: Self-Isolation
This week, I ended
up self-isolated for
three days while
my flatmates lay in
bed with fever and
feeling rather sorry for
themselves. Luckily, it
just turned out to be a
regular flu. Yay.
Unfortunately, that
also means this week's
Felix was put together
in record speed, and
this week's editorial is
a bit sparse. I decided
to take a leaf out of
the previous Editor's
book. See opposite.
The idea for this joke
editorial actually
came about as we
were internally
discussing the
possibility of running
a fully satirical April
Fools' issue towards
the end of this term.
Yes,itwouldhavebeen
rather premature, but
it would have been
bloody hilarious. We
ended up not going
ahead with it due
to time constraints,
but you can instead
look forward to an
extended Hangman
on the first issue back
next term - May 1st.
The last note here
is to wish you all
a lovely holiday -
and thank you for
your continuing
support. Enjoy the
backbreaking hours
of revision and try not
to have a breakdown.
See you in a few, and
good luck revising.
