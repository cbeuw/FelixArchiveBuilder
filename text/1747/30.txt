THROWBACK felix@imperial.ac.uk
The Throwback section this week is dedicated to International Women’s Day - we’ll be exploring the history of
woman at Imperial College, based on what we found during the ‘Diving into Herstory’ event we hosted in the
Felix office last Monday!
1950s
The 50s kicked off with debate about whether
women should be allowed in the ICU bar...
We discovered a variety of articles talking about female students. Frank
discussions in Felix of the physical merits of different women were commonplace.
