person over the shoulder
game looks to bring much
of what Resident Evil 2
brought last year. It looks
to be using the RE engine
to its fullest, with smooth
gameplay and beautiful
graphics. Seeing Nemesis
come to life in full HD
is both terrifying and
awesome. I still remember
playing RE 3 when I
was younger, albeit a
few years later than its
release… and this game is
exactly how I remember
it. The developers over at
Capcom have done a great
job of making a game that
is in pretty much all way
superior to the original,
whilst still feeling exactly
like you remember. Where
Resident Evil 7’s Mr X
occasionally popped up
and was easily dealt with,
Nemesis looks to be a
whole different beast. You
will be absolutely terrified
at some point while you
attempt to flee the grasp
of this monstrosity, but
hey… that’s what makes
Resident Evil great!
Fallout 76 Wastelanders
April 7th
PS4, PC, Xbox One
So, I have to be realwith
you guys. I am currently
trying to play through
Fallout 76 with a friend.
While it is nice to play
with him… that’s about it.
The game honestly still is
as buggy and frustrating as
everyone says. Hopefully,
with the Wastelanders ex-
pansion (which is free by
the way) coming out next
month, we should start
to see an improvement
to the game. Bethesda
are adding NPCs finally,
with dialogue options that
are ‘More like Fallout 3
than Fallout 4’. On top of
this there is a new story
mission, and plenty more
things to do in the waste-
land. I am trying very hard
not to get my hopes up,
but I would be lying if I
said that I wasn’t going to
jump back into the game
when this update comes
out. I will let y’all know if
it is any good and whether
Fallout 76 becomes worth
it with this new update.
Although chances are, it
won’t!
Final Fantasy VII Re-
make
April 10th
PS4 (Other platform
dates TBC)
So. One of the best
games ever is being
remade in full HD with
multiple fight options
(real-time or turn-based),
fully rendered cinematics,
voice acting, and an ex-
pansion to the story that
means it has to be released
in at least 3 separate parts.
AllIcansayis,yes.Having
played the demo earlier
this month, my hype is
unending. This month is a
monster for remakes with
both RE 3 and FFVII.
Given the immense love
for this game back when
it released on the PS1, a
remake was all but needed
in with today’s graphical
and technical capabilities.
While this game will only
include the first section of
the original (taking place
entirely in Midgar), it
will still be a full-length
game (meaning at least 30
hours long). I am insanely
excited for what they will
add to the story, as well as
revisioning the world that
I loved when I first played
it. I could not recommend
this game more highly. If
there is anything that you
pick up in April, It should
be Final Fantasy VII
remake.
Trials of Mana
April 24th
Switch, PC, PS4
Another remake! Trials
of Mana, known previ-
ously as Seiken Densetsu
3, is a game that was orig-
inally released in 1995
as a sequel to the much
beloved Secret of Mana.
For the 25th anniversary,
Square Enix are complete-
ly remaking the game in
full HD with voice acting.
Never before released in
the West, finally fans of
the series will have the
opportunity to experience
this part of the story of
Mana. From trailers, the
gameplay seems to be a
combination of turn-based
and real-time. If youa re a
fan of the Secret of Mana,
then this is a must get.
The real question is, how
do you choose what to
get this month when Final
Fantasy VII remake is
also coming out?
Minecraft Dungeons
April (exact date TBC)
Everything
I could only fit one
more game. So sadly, I
had to miss out Gears
Tactics and Predator:
Hunting grounds, 2
games I would highly
recommend checking
out also. The last game
I wanted to highlight is
Minecraft Dungeons. The
reason for this is that after
a decade of Minecraft,
taking the world by storm
and enticing millions of
players to jump into its
literally endless hours
of gameplay, creating,
exploring and building,
there is finally a new game
in the…series? Minecraft
Dungeons looks to be a
dungeon crawling Diab-
lo-like game. If you told
me a year ago that this
would be the evolution of
Minecraft, I would have
called you out on bullshit
but here we are. And I
won’t lie, the game play
actually looks interesting.
Anyone who grew up
playing Minecraft, or still
plays it, and wants a new
experience in the same
world, I highly recom-
mend checking this out.
I probably will so keep
on reading Felix for my
impressions on Minecraft
Dungeons (and many of
the other games listed
here as well!).
