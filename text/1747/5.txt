n celebration
of International
Women’s Day, Felix
spoke with Anne
about her book which
dives into the women here
at Imperial from the nine-
teenth century up until the
present.
Felix: What inspired
you to write Women
at Imperial: Past,
Present and Future?
I was asked to do it by
some of the senior women
in the college, Professor
Dame Julia Higgins of the
department of chemical
engineering and Emeritus
Professor Dorothy
Griffiths of the Business
School. It would’ve been
a very small book, but
then gradually as I was
working on it, everything
suddenly changed - there
were lots of women pres-
idents and women profes-
sors. The book evolved
from a monograph to now
with over 400 pages, and
there are still loads more
that could be said.
Felix: What is the
premise of the book?
What is the message
you want to deliver?
I went right back to
the nineteenth century
because my premise is
women have always been
at Imperial. The theory
has always been that they
have not, but they have.
It’s not part of the story
that was told. That could
be for a lot of reasons,
which I didn’t really go

“To me, biographies are
the most important thing,
telling the stories -- to tell
the history of the college in
such a way that it encourages
more people to come here. It
is for Imperial to have such a
record about women because
it is still perceived as a male-
pre-dominant place.
into because I just wanted
to state the facts with
verification.
Felix: The book
includes many details
in regards to the
women’s lives here at
Imperial. What kind
of archives did you
refer to obtain the
information?
We have evidence that
women were here from
various letters, corre-
spondence, and official
papers. Say for Julia
Higgins, she had done a
recording with the British
Library about her life, and
she allowed me to use it.
So I particularly looked at
the transcript and got a lot
of information from that.
There are also lots of
published documentation
in regards to when the
people were here, like
fellowships of Royal
Society. There’s a wealth
of information if you
know where to look for it
- journals, Felix, Reporter,
the alumni magazine,
minutes. We used to
have something called a
College Calendar, which
listed people in the organ-
isation. You could trace
someone’s career because
people were named in the
department, what their
roles were, and how it
changed from a particular
date.
Felix: In the book,
there’s a section
on families here
at Imperial which I
found particularly
interesting. How did
that come about?
I like to draw things
together, and there were
a lot of people, perhaps
by chance, who ended
up working together.
The Conrady family, for
example, the father was
the professor of optics.
He had four daughters,
three of whom went into
science. One of them
studied with him and
went into optical physics.
She married a fellow
student; they then went
to Rochester in New York
and developed the optics
there. Two of the other
daughters did chemistry;
one taught for a bit and
did research.
Felix: As you went
through the history
of women in Imperial,
did you notice a
pattern - a certain
year or time period
where women
became more preva-
lent?
I did not discern a
pattern, though there are
statistics from human re-
sources. Obviously, in the
last few years, there has
been a huge change with
Alice Gast as president
and more women as vice
provosts. We’ve always
had women professors
and lecturers, but it’s more
recently that women have
gained senior roles.
Felix: Do you see the
inclusivity of women
as part of Imperial’s
vision? Is it for the
university to push for
greater involvement
of women in STEM?
One of my arguments
is that it goes way back. It
starts way back in school
- universities can do so
much. They can’t change
the previous cultures; they
can encourage but they
can’t change everything.
If the familiar attitude
isn’t good for women to
do science, then that’s
the greatest struggle for a
person to have an interest
in science. It’s pre-univer-
sity - it starts way back in
society.
Felix: What is the
most important part
of the book to you
personally?
To me, the biographies
are the most important
thing, telling the stories
- to encourage people
to say “that’s a similar
background to me,” or “I
really want to do that.”
That’s my job - to tell the
history of the college in
such a way that it encour-
ages more people to come
here. It’s a great thing to
do; I’m very privileged
to have been able to do
it. It is for Imperial to
have such a record about
women because it is still
perceived as a male-pre-
dominant place.
