Daughter: Toxic Masculinity at its Darkest
A
s the lights fade
to black on
Adam Lazarus,
the star and
co-creator of Daughter,
a one-man performance
exploring toxic masculin-
ity, there was an audible
exhale from the back au-
dience. I was surprised to
find that it wasn’t my own
sigh owing to the sheer
relief that I felt that the
play had finally come to
a close. Am I suggesting
I didn’t enjoy the play?
Indisputably, I did not
enjoy the play. Would I
recommend it to a friend?
Absolutely.
Through 70 minutes
of captivating acting,
Lazarus takes us on the
long, sometimes despica-
ble, sometimes disgusting,
journey of a 30-something
year-old father who strug-
gles to come to grips with
the reality of fathering a
daughter. We are guided
from the very beginning
by Lazarus’s self-centred
approach to life, with
Lazarus preparing to take
his wife to the hospital for
the birth of their daughter;
even at this stage seeds
of self-intoxication are
sewn as he speaks of the
mattress he’s made sure to
pack (in case he becomes
tired of waiting around
for his wife to birth their
first born child). We move
through the play explor-
ing the more grotesque
details of his life. The
lightest moment being
when a sleep deprived
Adam couldn’t bear
his daughter’s constant
getting out of bed any
longer and so took matters
into his own hands to
forcibly put her back into
bed. The audience at this
stage, who were invited
to give an opinion on this,
were sympathetic to his
behaviour. However, as
we journey on, actions
become more unforgiv-
able, with an affair with a
16-year-old and hitting a
guest over the head with a
baseball bat.
After the play, during
a question and answer
session hosted by fellow
co-creator Aislinn Rose,
it is explained that the
play is based on the style
of Bouffon; a style of
performance which aims
to highlight and mock
the flaws of its audience.
With that explanation
under my belt, my initial
feelings of disgust and
discomfort turned into
a more productive and
justified anger. I left, for
the first time in my life,
wanting to possess the
supernatural power of
mind reading, just so that
I could peer into a man’s
head to see if it really was
as horrendous as Lazarus
described. I suspect, like
with most things I would
find a spectrum of results.
Daughter brutally high-
lights the darkest corners
of what can be found in
society and beautifully
provides a platform to
discuss the monster that is
toxic masculinity. For that
I thank it.
The Revenger’s Tragedy
S
ilence. Darkness.
The word
VENDETTA ap-
pears, illuminated
suddenly by searing stage
lights. A troupe of smartly
dressed actors who look
like they might be on the
way to a formal soiree
move and shake to a jazzy
tune, rather carelessly and
unabashedly as if guided
by an invisible puppet
master tugging at strings
bound to their limbs, as
they circle the stage.
This is a modern
Italian production, a
translation courtesy of
Stefano Massini, of the
classic play The Reveng-
er’s Tragedy (now La
Tragedia del Vendica-
tore), widely attributed to
the Jacobean playwright
son and heir Lussurioso
(Ivan Alovisio), aided
by his brother Hippolito
(Raffaele Esposito).
Director Declan
Donnellan paints a vivid,
modernised picture of
the classic Italian court,
where a twisting plot full
to the brim with corrup-
tion and revenge begins
to unfold with Shake-
spearean confusion. The
production takes place on
a minimalistic set consist-
ing mostly of a panelled
wood frame backdrop that
partially gives way to a
projector screen, showing
mostly a single image
telling us where we are.
Sometimes this image is a
black and white, real-time
feed from a professional
video camera held by one
of the actors that flashes
monochrome closeups
at us in a grainy fashion,
sometimes the images are
in gristly detail.
Despite the production
being entirely in Italian,
it is not difficult to follow
the plot, aided by some
to the dynamism of the
actors, who exhibit pas-
sionate fervour in their
on-stage antics, making
their intentions clear. A
brilliant example is the
way in which the tempt-
ress stepmother of the
Duke’s sons, the Duchess,
Gratiana (Pia Lanciotti),
exhibits her theatrical
pleas for mercy, or her hu-
morously sultry displays
for the alleged bastard
son of the Duke, Spurio
(Errico Liguori). Such
touches add to the at times
light, at others very dark
humour and pure absurd-
ity that pervade the play
and the production. This
absurdity is spotlighted
by the modernity. Indeed,
there was one particularly
amusing moment when
two of the Duke’s sons lay
on the ground, while the
younger uses the elder’s
vape as an asthma pump
to try to calm him down.
All in all, the actors,
director, and production
team put on a fast paced,
fluid performance which
has brought a classic play
into modern day Italy.
This performance has
highlighted the fact that
despite hundreds of years
of human experience,
stories of corruption and
feelings of anguish for
wrongs done by those
in power are still just as
relevant.
