A
s coursework
deadlines and
job applica-
tions loom,
why not find some es-
capism at the Above the
Stag Theatre in Vauxhall.
Hot shirtless assassins, a
queer author, and a naive
British spook make these
plays the perfect retreat
from the unrelenting
torrent of interview
preparation and late-
night submissions. In
this double bill with his
acclaimed one-act thrill-
er, Kompromat, Spy
Plays introduces David
Thame’s latest creation:
London/Budapest. Set
in a Pimlico flat in
1955 London, London/
Budapest features Adam
de Hegedus (Guy Warren
Thomas) the elusive
author of Britain’s first
gay bestseller. Adam is
joined in his flat by a
Royal Airforce Officer
(Max Rinehart), whom
he had invited over after
a Sunday afternoon
encounter at the Jermyn
Street baths.
Adam de Hegedus
steals the show, par-
ticularly in the first
half, delivering a
convincing depiction
of the Hungarian gay
novelist — conveying
his wit, campness,
and obvious desire
to return to his more
lavish and high-status
past, in a very natural
way. Despite the rather
forceful, and entirely
uncomfortable, rendi-
tion of oral sex between
the pair, one cannot help
but become enthralled in
the story as it unravels.
The venue itself is very
intimate; the smell of
struck matchsticks on
stage and the rumbling
of trains overhead only
adds to the atmospheric
nature of the play. The
set depicts exactly what
you would expect of
Adam’s 1950s flat, a
comfortable but by no
means well-off author’s
attempt to convey some
semblance of luxury.
Max Rinehart comes
into his own during
the second play of the
evening, enacting the
mysterious and, at times,
sinister rent boy Zac. He
easily conveys charm
and slickness in his
dialogue, adding depth
in his monologues when
he considers his future
and where the path of
hedonism has left him.
Guy Warren Thomas
plays the intelligent
but socially awkward
quantum cryptographer
Tom, on secondment to
MI6 from GCHQ — the
character and story
having been loosely
play down. The 2010
incarnation of the same
Pimlico flat is grey and
minimalist, garnished
with an Ikea table
you’ve seen a thousand
times before.
Lighting is more
directly used in Kom-
promat, with the floor
to ceiling windows
(well, lights) visualising
the passage of photons
through the glass
whilst Tom explains the
concept of wave-particle
duality to a perplexed
audience. The uncer-
tain nature of quantum
particles is mirrored by
Zac’s state of mind: as
quantum particles must
decide on their state
when observed, so Zac
must act under the watch
of two Hungarian thugs
beyond the glass.
Whilst the plays hold
the audience’s attention
and ultimately deliver
a satisfying conclusion,
there are points of
lacklustre dialogue and
awkward interactions. It
is a production to go and
see if you are carried
away with stories of
gay spies and intriguing
mysteries, but it will fail
to deliver as an edge-
of-your-seat thriller.
David Thame must be
applauded for his un-
compromising portrayal
of the enigmatic deaths
of two spies, but one
can’t help but feel as
though the show were
carried by the actors
for prolonged moments.
Playing in their roles
until the 29th March,
Guy Warren Thomas
and Max Rinehart are
worth visiting, though
I would leave any lofty
expectations at the door.
