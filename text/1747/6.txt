I
t’s no secret that this
ambiguous period
of our youthful lives
will soon come to
an end. Many of us here
lack any sort of survival
responsibility out in the
real world yet. These
couple of years that serve
as a sheltered bootcamp
for the outside world of
real consequences will
soon come to an end and
we’ll all have to depend
on ourselves sooner rather
than later. An obvious step
towards full independence
is having aspirations of a
career, but realistically,
many of us are clueless
in breaching this eternally
uncertain limbo. People
fill their lives with all sorts
of stuff, like collecting
brownies badges, some
turn to the Union to fill the
gaping hole, while others
find verification through
social means. Throughout
University you will have
been bombarded with
rhetoric that emphasises
the worth of a person
comes from their high
academic attainment and
professional experience.
This culture is, in part,
fostered on LinkedIn.
I’ve been on
LinkedIn. It’s populated
with people who do their
best to appear like the
most naïve and insuffer-
able people. They run a
thin line between living
reality and hosting their
own TED talk; people are
frighteningly positive,
and that is perfectly
accepted. Normal people
do not act like this. Not
in real life. LinkedIn is
the only social media
platform that explicitly
encourages the need to
impress others.
LinkedIn is a pro-
fessional circle jerk of
bragging how many
qualifications you have,
about self-congratula-
tory dicksucking just
to prove your worth for
recruiters. People are
reduced to a consommé
of things they’ve done,
and not things they are.
Once again, with all
social media, it becomes
a popularity contest. The
people on LinkedIn not
only want to kiss your
arse, they are out there
to give your bowels a
dry clean (within 5-7
business days).
It’s completely un-
genuine and it unsettles
me greatly. Everyone
acts mechanical, and
wants nothing but to
please their connections.
People’s personalities
are stripped away;
the self-censorship
is cringeworthy. Is it
inspirational? There’s
only so much saccharine
and overwrought mel-
odramatic life stories I
can read in one scroll.
It does nothing but per-
petuate insecurity and
comparison with others.
While users of Facebook
are permitted to have a
heart and soul, LinkedIn
is an obsessive-compul-
sive bureaucratic mask
that filters people’s true
personalities through a
marketing committee.
A surrealist non-reality
exists in the realms of
being grumpy. LinkedIn
seems to be the future,
and I probably won’t
have changed anyone’s
perspective. LinkedIn
is here to stay, and the
future is bleak.

LinkedIn. The ache
for attention is ever so
heightened by material
self-worth, like qual-
ifications and work
experiences, which have
become much easier
to compare to others.
LinkedIn is a manifesta-
tion of every concern we
had with social media.
An inherent fake façade,
imposing unrealistic
societal standards on
people. It is arguably
more harmful than inse-
curities with self-image
for young people—
please don’t capitalise
on our insecurities to
turn what is the best
years of our lives into a
corporate factory farm.
If you’re into tossing
salad, feel free to get
LinkedIn. Maybe I’m
“If you’re into
tossing salad,
feel free to get
