Towards the end of the 1950s, the College’s
ﬁrst female professor was appointed. 1970s Throughout the
70s, the inclusion
of women in the
bars and events like
freshers’ dinners
continued to be hot
topics, with women
taking action to
ensure they had equal
access and rights -
predominantly by
debating the contents
of the Union and
constituent union
constitutions, which
in themselves had no
exclusionary aspects!
This eventually developed into broader discussions about inclusion, such as surveys on
whether to have mixed-gender ﬂoors and facilities in halls - which, as it meant more women
joining halls, caused quite the debate about ‘sex discrimination’ (lul.) Women’s Studies
courses also kicked off at Imperial in the 70s.
