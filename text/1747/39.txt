NONOGRAM
SUDOKU
Hello Puzzlers!
We‚Äôve had spots of rain re-
cently; the nonogram might
help you out (until the cutout
becomes drenched and is of
no use what-so-ever). We are
still looking for the mysterious
coder who came to see us (we
will be in the Felix office every
Tuesday 3-5 during term time
if not in exams). Also, we for-
got to save the answer to the
cryptogram last week, so thank
you for your solutions! Happy
end-of-term (Easter egg hunt
delayed until next term), and
see you in the summer term
(01/05)! Rain, rain, go away.
Take the virus far away? (()) <-
a few more brackets because
why not?
