For The Many, Not The Flu
HANGMAN
It’s that time of year.

T
he new hand
sanitiser “For
the Many not
the Flu” goes on
sale today. The packaging
describes it as the only
cleaning product that
can target the top 0.01%
of germs while leaving
the remaining 99.99% of
hard-working microbes
alone.
Ceremy Jorbyn, head
of Left Forum and noted
papier-mâché enthusiast
said that during this
challenging period it was
prime time for Left Forum
to expand their business
portfolio, previously
limited to urinal cakes and
National Geographic back
editions, while keeping to
their brand values. “This
product will be the first
to begin setting right the
historical wrong done to
the bacterial peoples by
Western medicine,” he
said.
While the industry
standard has been to target
as many microbes as pos-
sible, Ceremy Jorbyn said
that the gel was intended
to act as a form of redis-
tributive justice, allowing
the proletarian bacteria
to access the respiratory
tracts and mucosal mem-
branes that they deserved.
The gel is said to be
produced to the highest
ethical standards tested
only on animal volunteers
at the Creatures In Less-
than Loving Middle-class
Environments (CILLME)
outreach program for
pets given as Christmas
presents and neglected by
March.
Chemicals for the
sanitiser are ethically
sourced from the back
and brow sweat of Cuban
farm workers, collected
by running them through
a laundry wrangle after
a hard day’s work on the
collective farm. In ex-
change, members of Left
Forum have promised to
deliver a lecture series on
removing the oppressive
weight of capitalism.
Farm workers were said
to be crushed by the news.
A representative of
the microbe elite has
responded in horror to the
news. “We had a deal with
the pharma companies!
They nuke the plebs for us
and we agree not to infect
them. But this is war. I
hope those fuckers like
sales of antibacterial
soaps through the roof.
Feb Senton, 4th
year medic
and homeopathy enthusi-
ast said, “I generally don’t
believe in germs but this
whole COVID thing is
really ruining my vibe. I
want a hand sanitiser that
both keeps me safe and
also doesn’t challenge my
worldview. For the Many
not the Flu really fits the
bill”.
Other members of
the microbial elite have
quickly had a change of
heart. Aliceria Ghatillus, a
member of the family that
has monopolised the bit
of loos where the water
comes out of for genera-
tions told NegaFelix, “I
was always on the side of
the struggling masses. I’m
an ally! You need to tell
Oh, fuck, now there’s four of them! // Wikimedia
people!”
Other members of the
public have looked on in
amusement at the argu-
ments. Wake Jalker, 1st
year geophysics said, “All
these idiots are missing
the obvious. If you just
use the two together
you can eradicate all the
bacteria and protect your-
self from coronavirus.”
Jalker’s confidence was
only slightly knocked
when told that antibac-
terial hand-washes did
not protect people from
viruses. He has since been
put in isolation, as no one
wants to hear his smug
voice anymore.
“We had a
deal with
the pharma
companies!
I hope those
fuckers like
sneezing”
sneezing”
The news is very timely
as coronavirus drives
