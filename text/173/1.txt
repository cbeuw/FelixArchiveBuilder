IC VICTORY IN RELAY
day, thanks to a brilliant last lap by John
Cleator. Taking over 37 seconds behind
the Leeds University man he proceeded to
narrow the gap to 15 seconds at the half way
mark and then finally to take the lead only
half a mile from the finish. Incidentally at the
same place at which we lost the lead last
year.
Eighty runners, another record entry, lined
up for the first lap of the 3 mile course en-
circling the Serpentine. Birmingham led the
way but were soon overhauled by Edinburgh
who retained the lead to the first takeover.
Pete Roy running the first lap for I. C , had a
steady race and handed over to fresher Jo
Fitzshnmons. Jo ran well against stiff op-
position to hand over in the tenth position.
Edinburgh increased their lead over Birming-
ham, but T. Briault, running for St. John's
Camb., brought his team through the field
from 43rd place to hand over the 3rd position.
In doing so he broke the course record with
a time of 13 m. 57 s. John Young, running
3rd for the College, brought us up steadily
to finish in 6th position. A t this stage Edin-
burgh were still leading, but Leeds Univer-
sity with a good effort by T. Totton, were
in second place. The fourth lap saw a dram-
atic change in the lead; Geoff Wood, the
Leeds runner, took first position just after
Hyde Park Corner and had opened up a
200 yd. gap by the finish: Nottingham Uni-
versity had moved to second place. John
Collins, his 7th time competing and surely
the veteran of the I. C. team, brought us up
to 4th place, less than a minute behind the
leaders. He handed over to Ted Wilkins who
overhauled the Nottingham runner at the half
way stage to take second place.
Then came John jCleator's fantastic last
lap and a thrilling victory for the College,
with a new course record of 88m.31s. This
is the first time since 1949 that I . C . has
won. However, on that occasion only nine
teams were entered.
Herb Elliot, running for Jesus College,
Camb. in the last lap, took his team up ten
places to 18th, claiming the fourth fastest time
in doing so. Queen's College Camb. who were
always just out of Ihe limelight, were the
first minor college (with less than 500 men
students) in 10th place.
After the race Lady Hill presented the Sir
Rodric Cup to Chris James, the I. C. captain
and the Imperial College Union Cup to
Queen's College.

FROM T H E HORSE'S M O U T H : Being a personal
interview with the Great Man himself:
After the race Herb Elliott told me that he
hoped to run against New Z&alander Peter
Snell, the world mile record holder, in the
Empire Games at Perth, Australia, in Novem-
ber this year. However, this depends on his
studies which he deems more important than
running (which he still does for "fun").
