In October, with the nucleus of last years
very successful team remaining, prospects for
the coming season were bright. However, sev-
eral factions have combined which have re-
sulted in the club having a rather lean seas-
on. The records at present are:
1st X V P —13; W — 2; L — 2;
2nd X V P — 8; W —2; L — 6;
After the I . C . 1st X V had been selected,
we were faced with the problem of building
a team almost from scratch. The trial, as
usual, revealed some talent but left a lot more
unseen so that for the first few games the
teams were never the same twice running.
This term, after a good start, sees the loss, of
another key player to I. C ; and exams, have
once again meant that the first X V have been
very unsettled. The second X V , as is inevit-
able for a reserve team, has been very unset-
tled too; and unfortunately at times has not
been fielded owing to lack of snanrpower.
However, it has produced some good perfor-
mances at those times when reasonably con-
stant.
Prospects for the SDarke's Cup Match, when
I.C. and U . L . players are valuable are good.
Hence, another will take place on March 7th
and 23rd and all support will be very wel-
come.

The rugby season of 1961-62 started off in
the usual manner with a rather chaotic fresh-
er's trial. From a total of 40 the talent was
sorted out and with a heavy fixture list to
fulfil, the prospect looked premising. How-
ever, as usual, the I.C. Wednesday team tooK
a heavy tool on our playing resources; all the
first team positions have at one time or an-
other this season been filled by Guildsmen
with ten playing regularly. This does credit
to the Club but reflects rather obviously on
our record. T o date the Guild's first team
has won two matches and drawn one, but
mention must also he made of five cancel-
lations, four of them consecutivelv. The sec-
ond team, under Chris Head, consists mainly
of the unbeaten I.C. B.7 team and can show
a much more impressive record, with seven
won and one drawn. A third team has been
regularly chosen but difficulty has arisen in
arranging fixtures. However, they have done
well in winning four out of seven.
The Club membership to date is over sixty
and an impressive turnout is guaranteed for
the Sparkes' Cup. The support of all Guilds-
men is vital for these matches which will be
played on the first two Wednesdays in March.
