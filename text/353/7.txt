STUDENT RADIO FOR LC.
Why should w e have a student
radio station? We already have Felix
and STOIC IC-Wide; for a start Felix
only comes out fortnightly and any
news in it <is no longer news.
Until recently it has not lived up to
its definition as a college newspaper,
catering for the views of most stu-
dents at IC. On the other hand STOIC
is limited in what it can do; mainly
due to its dependence on College
owned equipment, and the co-opera-
tion of College employed personnel,
who understandably, are unwilling to
give up too much of their spare time.
Added to which STOIC cannot expand
much more than it has done already,
in terms of quality, versatility and
air time. Even pouring more money
into STOIC and/or Felix will not im-
prove the overall quality of either's
output.
PROGRAMMES
Imperial College Radio can provide
a much better media service to stu-
dents at IC. IC Radio can broadcast
a more up to date and comprehensive
news service plus a better sports re-
sults service, than either Felix or
STOIC are capable of doing. To
watch STOIC you must go to the
TVs around, whereas ICR oan be
listened to in your own room, on your
own 'trannie'—listen to it without 'in-
terrupting your academic work. W e
propose a radio station broadcasting
to students in hall and house, at
weekends and week day evenings,
when you are not searching around for
your mid-day meal. It would transmit
on medium wave around 300 metres
(Which most radios oan receive). ICR
could on a regular basis cover a much
wider spectrum than either Felix or
STOIC; for example it could include
regular programmes from Jazz Club,
Folk Club, IC Ents, IOWA, Electronic
music group, IC Musical society,
Dramsoc, and many other such clubs.
We would also like to start up a
weekly inter-hall or house competi-
tion, on the lines of a comic quiz pro-
gramme—'This week it's Lin stead
versus Weeks on how to run a suc-
cessful bar'. 'What's O n ' , request
grammes and student music pro-
grammes would complete our 'provi-
sional prospectus.
SERVICE
What about Capitol and 247, oan
we compete With them? 247 only pro-
vides a reasonable service for stu-
dents between the hours of 10 p.m.
and midnight. Six days a week; Capi-
tol does not provide a student service
on Sunday (all day) and after 8.30
p.m. on weekdays. We would start up
the station, broadcasting at 12 noon
till 12 midnight Sundays, and 6 p.m.
to 10 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and
Saturdays With specialist music pro-
grammes to start with. We would be
able to get all the new releases (as do
the other radio Stations) from the
record companies — consequently
we could provide a record review ser-
vice.
COST
The initial cost i s estimated to be
£1,500 With running oosts of around
£400 per annum (Nfi Felix costs
£2,000 per annum just to run). It has
been noted that College might be
prepared to pay some part of (this,
thus offsetting the initial costs. There
is a questionnaire due this week to
find out the views of the average stu-
dent in hall and house, upon this sub-
ject. Initial response from various
people has been favourable, but we
would like to obtain a more represen-
tative view before putting our case to
Council or a U G M .
A s ever, if you want to play a part
in the radio station come and see us
personally. W e hope this has given
you an insight to what student radio
in IC could be like, and if there are
any questions please come and see
us.

GAYSOC
DISCO
UCL Union small lounge.
Thursday 7th February
at 8.0 p.m. and at fort-
nightly intervals after-
wards .
Clive Dewy (Linstead
625, or Maths I) would
like to hear from anyone
interested in setting up
or taking part in, a stu-
dent radio station, here
at IC.
FEBRUARY 5 1954
MEALS
Complaints about the
reduction in 1 / 7 d
dishes in ithe lower din-
ing hall are completely
unjustified. Figures show
that during a certain per-
iod, 147 different dishes
were offered at 1 / 7 d as
opposed to 87 at 1/9d
and 40 at 2 / 0 and
above. The misconcep-
tion has arisen from at-
tempts to introduce a
wider choice of dishes,
an effort which should be
welcomed by all using
this refectory.
SUICIDES
lit has been very
noticeable in the last few
years that the number of
suicidal attempts by stu-
dents of Oxford, Cam-
bridge, London and other
of the larger Universi-
ties, is increasing at an
alarming rate.
ICWA BOAT CLUB
The formation of a
women's boat club has
recently been discussed
The need for more
women at IC is clear,
since at least two dozen
active members and a
coach would be neces-
sary to produce two rac-
ing crews.
ICWA must realise,
however, that it is un-
reasonable to expect the
cons i d erab'le a Ite rati on s
to the boatho'use neces-
sary to cater for a hand-
ful of their members
Who might mot row regu-
larly after all. The solu-
tion is surely for our
Amazons to join U L
women's boat club,
which has good facili-
ties.
FEBRUARY 13, 1959
Motion for U G M on
Thursday, February 24th,
1959: "This Union
should commit the mas-
cots of the three consti-
tuent colleges to a place
of reverence and safety,
and that they should be
left there as a symbol of
the hooliganism of the
past." This promises to
be a Union Meeting
worth attending.
QUEUES
At the last meeting
of the refectory commit-
tee, the question of
queues in the various
eating establishments
around this college was
raised. The idea of stag-
gering lecture times near
the lunch hour was pro-
posed and, while this
might well ease the situ-
ation on three days a
week, during the long
General Studies lunch-
hour, this Will have no
effect. Mr. Mooney pro-
poses to cut down the
choice of dishes, with a
view to speeding up the
service—a rather unfor-
tunate method, but if it
works, perhaps some
people may think it
worth it.
FEBRUARY 12, 1964
200th EDITION
RAID
Last week 70 Regent
Street Poly students bat-
tled with attendants and
were thrown out, when
they tried to raid the
Festival Hall. Their effort
was an attempted copy
of IC's successful raid
which raised £ 6 6 last
May.
COUNCIL
Although the Council
Meeting on Monday, 3rd
February, lasted for 6
hours it was a great im-
provement on the one
held the week before.
Everyone had already
agreed to the setting up
of the position of Deputy
President but there were
many views on the
method of election of
the post and also that of
President and Secretary.
After discussion it was
decided that the Deputy
President alone should
be elected by the Union
members at the Annual
General Meeting.
The Council defeated
by 15 votes to none a
motion that the Union
should organise a collec-
tion for the Kennedy
Fund. IC would have
had to provide £600.
Collecting tins will be
provided but there will
be no high pressure
salesmanship.
COLCUTT
A recent report of
council proceedings has
suggested that the whole
Reporter: And how do yo»
find yourself managing on
your grant?
thing is a waste of time
and that council mem-
bers would be much;
better occupied else-
where. The President
was heard to say "it's a
shambles" When he left
the meeting, but it's
really his job to prevent
a shambles. Perhaps if
he controlled council
meetings as he did last
term more would be
achieved.
FEBRUARY 6, 1969
LSE
At an emergency
meeting of the City and
Guilds last Friday, a
motion was passed ex-
pressing disapproval of
the recent action of cer-
tain LSE students at
ULU. 650 students at-
tended the meeting and
there were several mem-
bers of the national press
also present. He asked
Guilds to make it known
that IC is no hot-bed of
revolutionary fervour
and that militant stu-
dents will have no sup-
port here. " W e must
make it crystal clear that
we are warning off Tariq
Ali and rent-a-mob", he
said. The motion was
carried by 579 Votes for,
50 against, with 21 ab-
stentions.
U G M
Once again, inquoracy
caused the last IC Union
meeting to close early,
after only two motions
had been proposed. A
motion proposing that
women should be allow-
ed in the Union bar was
defeated. The second
referred to the donation
of £ 2 5 to a certain
Charity. This was also
defeated. A motion re-
ferring to the plight of
Soviet Jewry was greet-
ed by a mass exodus
from the hall, and the
calling of the quorum
was left as a formality.
