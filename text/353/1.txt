UNIV. BUDGETS
AT A STROKE
The Under Secretary for Education,
Mr. Timothy Raison, last week an-
nounced, in a written answer, that
Universities as their part of the cut-
back on education, will lose around
£31.75m next academic year—and
further reductions are likely.
This confirmed the fears of many
academics and students, who predict-
ed that a great deal of pressure was
to be put on University financing this
year. The cuts have been made as
follows:
the £16.75 million 'inflation
grant' to Universities, which is
designed to compensate for in-
creased non-academic staff sal-
aries and increases in the cost
of furniture is removed
a reduction from £35.25m to
£15m in the furniture and equip-
men grant.
This means that we can only buy
half as many benches, chairs, etc.—
and that is assuming that the prices
stay the samel
There is much confusion amongst
VCs as to how the budget cuts are
to be met, but two things are certain:
universities will not be able to admit
es many students this year, as they
hoped (and signs are that applications
are up) and that many retiring staff
will not be replaced.
Mr. Raison indicated that further
cuts are likely: 'Further savings will
be found from the further and higher
education sectors . . . ' H e said that
he was in touch with the U G C about
further reductions that would now be
necessary.
The Times Higher Education Sup-
plement (January 25th) predicts that,
even optimistically speaking, univer-
sity budgets for the next three years
have been cut by about £100m and
that £150m worth of buildings have
been postponed. Furthermore, the
targets for numbers of students in
university by 1977, will be drastically
reduced, specially affecting universit-
ies like Lancaster where applications
are up by 22.5 per cent on last year.
Reaction by the universities has
been muted but losses have been
estimated at up to £800,000 (Oxford,
Cambridge and Manchester). Univer-
sities of a size and nature comparable
to IC such as Lancaster, Sheffield,
Sussex and Salford may lose up to
£250,000.
No official reaction has been forth-
coming from the College.
DEMONSTRATE
A L L O U T
This Friday, February
8th, sees what is hoped
will be a massive demon-
stration in London by
students from all over
the country to express
their dissatisfaction with
the present grants' sys-
tem and the apparent
lack of action by this
Government to remedy
the situation.
The demonstration in
the form of a march, will
begin at Waterloo and
progress via the D.E.S.
to Hyde Park where there
will be a rally addressed
by NUS and trade union
speakers.
The disgraceful state
of affairs which has
brought about the need
for this demonstration.
B I D T O O U S T
R A N D A L L
An attempt to oust the president, Mr. John Ran-
dall, will be made at the NUS conference at Liver-
pool, in April. Mr. Stuart Paul, an executive mem-
ber, has broken convention of a formal re-election
of the president for his second year.
Mr. Paul (26, Glaswegian and Labour Party)
rs a member of the Broad Left group of the execu-
tive, which constitutes a majority of the Execu-
tive. There are ten members of the Broad Left
group on the Executive of 16. In a letter to stud-
ent leaders (including several IC members) at
the weekend, Mr. Paul accuses Mr. Randall of a
lack of leadership and policy in the grants cam-
paign.
Stuart Paul, with an impeccable working class
background, went over well at the last NUS con-
ference in Margate. M r . Paul's popularity may
account for the Broad Left decision to break the
two-year convention.
Mr. Randall last week dated his disagreement
with the executive Broad Left group from the
time when he was elected president. He accused
Mr. Paul of risking the unity of the NUS by em-
barking on a campaign based on personality and
of whipping up policy differences where none
existed.
APPOINTMENT
OF NEW
PRO-RECTOR
PROFESSOR M . G. FLEMING has been appoint-
ed Pro Rector of Imperial College from 1 Septem-
ber, 1974 in succession to Professor B. G. Neal.
On his appointment as Pro Rector, Professor
Fleming will cease to be Head of the Department
of Mining and Mineral Technology but will retain
his chair.
MAGGIE VISITS I.C.
Mrs. Margaret Thatch-
er graced Imperial Col-
lege with her presence
on the day of issue of
the last Felix. She was
present for an inaugural
lecture given by Profes-
sor Afastair Cameron
(Professor of Lubrication
Engineering in the De-
partment of Mechanical
Engineering), the title of
which was 'Fundamental
research in an industrial
world'.
The president, Nor-
man Sayles, and the
Hon. Secretary, Paul
Wadsworth, learnt of the
visit at the last moment.
They discovered that
she was to be present at
the Hall Dinner that
same evening and they
arranged to be present
also. At the end of the
meal, as Mrs. Thatcher
was leaving with the rec-
tor, Sir Brian Flowers,
Messrs. Sayles and
Wadsworth presented
her with a letter. This re-
iterated the case for the
various aspects of the
grants campaign, with
special reference to the
cut-backs in spending
announced the previous
day.
Mrs. Thatcher accept-
ed the letter, thanking
them for the way in
which the presentation
was done (i.e. no mass
demonstrations) and
promised to reply.
Copies of the letter
are available from the
Hon. Secretary, M r .
Wadsworth, In the Union
office.
SOAS SICKS STUDENT
The London University
School of Oriental and
African Studies has
sacked one of its stud-
ents after she had plead-
ed guilty to a drugs
charge.
The student, Gloria
George, 19, admitted
possessing 114 milli-
grams of cannabis, three
LSD tablets, and at-
tempting to pass drugs
to another person. She
spent two weeks in re-
mand and was sentenced
to two years probation.
Whilst she was in
prison she received a let-
ler from the college say-
ing that her course had
been terminated because
she had fallen too far
behind with her work.
This was despite the
fact that she is suppos-
edly one of the most
brilliant on her course,
and had arranged to have
her books with her in
prison.
Mr. David Mudd, M P
for Falmouth and Cam-
borne (Gloria's local
MP) has taken tip her
case. He stated that he
was in agreement with
sackings inflicted on
every student already
knows about. Discretion-
ary awards which do not
affect people taking Uni-
versity degree courses
are preventing people
from gaining qualifica-
tions in Higher educa-
tion. How many friends
do you know, though at
training and further edu-
cation college who are
being hampered by this
situation? Shouldn't you
be voicing your support
for them? Why should
the desire for qualifica-
tions in order to better
oneself or gain a better
job be made difficult and
further education be a
privilege of the rich? The
inadequacy in the
Grants' system which
svery one of us at I.C.
knows about, is of course
• the Means Test. It is ob-
vious to everyone—ex-
cept apparently those
people who are in a posi-
tion to do something
about it that this idea
should be abolished in
favour of a full grant in
every student's own poc-
ket, and such a tax lev-
ied on parents which
would be less harsh than
the present unfair paren-
tal contribution scheme.
Postgraduates prob-
ably have the rawest deal
of all since they are, in
fact, being penalised for
having gained a first de-
gree in as much as their
grant per week (a dis-
gustingly inadequate
£13.40) is less than that
of an undergraduate.
They have also just been
surprised by government
proposals which could
mean that those wishing
to pursue postgraduate
courses would be requir-
ed to borrow from the
government the money
to finance themselves.
It has also been recog-
people guilty of drug of-
fences. 'However,' he
said, 'I am most con-
cerned that on this occa-
sion it looks as if an ob-
scure and unrelated reas-
on has been used to
send Gloria packing'. He
is asking the university
authorities to grant
Gloria and her father a
personal interview on
her appeal against dis-
missal.
At a ULU SRC meet-
ing last week Gloria's
case was discussed.
nised that the actual lev-
el of Undergraduate
grants is at its lowest
ebb ever. Even the Com-
mittee of Vice Chancel-
lors and Principals
(C.V.C.R.) have indicat-
ed that a figure of " A t
least £ 6 3 0 " is needed
for students living away
from home at Universit-
ies other than London,
Cambridge and Oxford,
to bring the grants back
to a level comparable to
that of 1962. This is i n
line with the NUS de-
mand for £655. Due to
our apathy and inactivity
however,, wilil the Gov-
ernment be led into
thinking that we will be
happy with another £ 2 0
increase? How have W E
shown how serious our
needs are? How have
WE publicised our
plight? Rent strikes have
failed, petitions nowa-
days carry little weight,
iso what have we left?
This demonstration on
Friday gives every stud-
ent a final opportunity
before the Government
announcement to level
their weight to the action
for a fair Grants system
for everyone who wishes
to gain further education.
Obviously there will
be factions on the De-
monstration who will not
be prepared merely to
support Grants action
but who will be demand-
ing the removal of the
present Government and
solidarity With every oth-
er trade union which is
currenly involved in in-
dustrial disputes with
the Government. I put it
to you that the more sen-
sible students Who
peacefully participate on
Friday the more repre-
sentative of those people
wanting to study the De-
monstration will be, and
thus the more public sup-
port we Will get for our
plight.
For I.C. Students the
meeting place for the
Demonstration will be
the one and only (thank
goodness), that remnant
of Victorian splendour
(?)—you've guessed it;
The Queen's tower at
11.30 a.m. on FRIDAY,
the 8th February. See
you there!!!!!!
