OPERATIC
SOCIETY
The uninformed mem-
bers of IC society may,
or may not, be interested
to know that for as little
an expenditure as 30p
they can be privileged to
see one of the foremost
(some say the foremost
— seriously) amateur
operatic societies in the
country. Yes, it's your
own, your very own,
ICOS, whose latest ex-
travaganza, 'Princess
Ida', by Gilbert and
Sullivan, will be per-
formed in the Union
Concert Hall from Tues-
day, 12th to Saturday,
16th February.
'Having irretrievably
attracted your attention
(if not, don't read on),
I'll teh you something
about our, and your,
society, while at the
same time subtly entic-
ing you to see the show
(oh, what a give-away!).
As the Blue Book, it
say, consists of about
50 members emanating
from several USK col-
leges. The range of
musical abilities is ex-
ceptionally wide, liter-
ally from A R C M stand-
ard to A R S M level (take
that how you wish). A l l
have certain qualities in
common, however; en-
thusiasm and an incom-
prehensible desire to do
their singing while des-
perately trying to con-
centrate on whether to
use expression A or ex-
pression B, and Whom to
follow in the next dance.
Apart from the cast we
have a very proficient,
spirited and, some might
say, ageless miscellany
of instrumentalists,
known loosely as the
orchestra, and a crew of
highly dedicated, semi-
nocturnal individuals
who. with great help
from Dramsoc, achieve
miracles each year to
create a realistic set,
while at the same time
leaving the performers
enough room to swing a
semibreve on the hope-
lessly inadequate con-
cert hah stage.
Traditionally ICOS
gives two shows each
year: one at IC in Feb-
ruary and a tour show in
July, this year featuring
"HMS Pinafore". In re-
cent years, however,
single performances of
short one-act comic
operas have been pro-
duced, this year's being
"Trial by Jury" on
Thursday, March 21st as
a lunchtime concert.
The highlight of the
year is undoubtedly the
summer tour to Budleigh
Salterton, which for 50
weeks of the year is a
peaceful little South
Devon holiday resort.
Here, lured by the pros-
pects of singing, swim-
ming, sunning, socialis-
ing, and cider swilling
and other things begin-
ning with V (not neces-
sarily in that order), 70
enthusiasts arrive to a
rapturous welcome. A s
our reputation in that
c u l t u r a l wilderness
grows in leaps and
bounds, we attract 2,000
people each year, and
last year raised over
£60 in a charity concert
of classical music in the
local church (not bad
after only one day's re-
hearsal).
If ICOS are so brilli-
ant, you say, why can't
you try real opera such
as Verdi, Wagner or
Engelbert Humperdinck,
instead of mere Gilbert
and Sullivan. Each year
we ask ourselves the
same question, and inev-
itably reach the same
conclusions; that G & S
is virtually the only
jchoice for a society
wishing to maintain
maximum involvement
for all members while
being limited in terms of
facilities, expenditure
and rehearsal time. G &
S also has the advantage
of being easy to appreci-
ate for the average scien-
tist and engineer who is
prepared to look at it
objectively for one night
(not everyone can have
the cultural awareness
of the aesthetic mines-
man). Even the most
sceptical beings have
been taken along to a
show under duress only
to confess later that it
was the funniest thing
they'd seen for a long
time. I must, however,
sympathise with the per-
son who still has night-
mares about being
conscripted as one of
the 'three little maids
from school' by an un-
compromising music
master in need of boy
sopranos.
Sullivan's music can
be said to be full of
catchy tunes, sometimes
unashamedly adapted
from the works of pom-
posers such as Mozart
and Handel, who, no
doubt, have been turn-
ing in their graves ever
since. Gilbert, the lib-
bretist of the duo, was
a master of parody,
choosing as his victims,
people or events in the
public eye at the turn of
the century, although
some of his innuendos,
intentional or not (I
wonder) wouldn't dis-
grace the likes of
Frankie Howerd.
I hope the few who've
had the will power to
read this far will come
along in February to see
what I mean. Tickets
(here comes the crunch)
are 30p, 40p or 50p, on
sale in the Union en-
trance from January
28th. Any other enquiries
about the society are
welcome via the Union
letter rack.

Chairman.
INDIA
SOCIETY
One of the largest
social societies in Col-
lege is the India Society.
With a membership of
nearly 100, this society
aims to provide varied
entertainment and give
students an insight into
the Indian way of life.
Without a shade of
doubt, we have been
perhaps the most active
social society during the
last term. One of the
major highlights of 'last
term was the perform-
ance of Shakuntala Devi,
India's human calculat-
ing machine. This func-
tion proved to be very
popular and was well
attended. Other func-
tions included an Indian
song and dance feature
plus didio to mark the
celebration of Diwali,
the Indian festival of
lights. In December,
even with our limited
funds, we managed to
stage a film show—an
"end of term" function.
All these functions
were well attended and
were significant succes-
ses — one, because our
publicity tends to be as
far-reaching as possible,
and two, we have co-
operation with the India
Societies of other Col-
leges of London Univers-
ity.
FUNCTIONS
We intend to hold
more functions this
term, but these may be
held up due to the ener-
gy situation. The energy
situation permitting, the
highlights of this term
should be a celebration
on the occasion of
India's Republic Day
Which fell on 26th Jan-
uary, and an inter-univ-
ersity India societies'
tournament, normally
held in MarkbeSter.
Teams from India Socie-
ties of London, Leeds,
held in Manchester.
Saiford, etc., compete
for the Air India Cup,
Which is donated by Air
India in co-operation
with the Indian High
Commission. The games
played are soccer, table-
tennis, b a d m i n t o n ,
hockey, etc., and the
competition is - very
keen. However, this
event has not been final-
ised yet.
India Society has dir-
ect liaison with the In-
dian High Commission,
and their periodical,
India Weekly, is avail-
able in the Haldane
Library.
One other feature of
our functions is that we
have Indian food for sale
at reasonably (pheap
prices.
Membership (12£p)
of the society is Stj'll
open. We do try to cater
for as many tastes as we
can afford to — in some
of our functions a defin-
ite blend with the West-
ern way of life is
noticeable! Constructive
criticism and sugges-
tions are always wel-
come.
For membership and
other enquiries, please
leave a note addressed
to 'India Society' in the
S.C.C. pigeon-hole in
the Union Common
Room.
CLUB
Yes, folks — in case
you didn't know, there
is sudh a thing. We exist
in the Sports Centre
(that's where the pond
is).
At the moment IC have
fought their way through
to the semi-finals of the
Inter London College
Knock Out Cup, brushing
aside all who dare chal-
lenge. We have a selec-
tion of members shoot-
ing for London Univers-
ity and Simon Hel'lyer
is now shooting for
London County team.
Later in the term there
will be the annual walk-
over by Guilds in the
Courtman Shield match.
This is between Guilds,
RCS and occasionally
RSM (if they can scrape
up a team). So all you
Mines Who fancy your-
selves, and at shooting,
come down the range
any lunchtime soon.
W e need a vacant
person to' fill the post of
captain of R S M to org-
anise a Mines team for
this competition. So,
Miners, please make
yourselves known!
There also exists a
sparkling ladies team
full of promise. Put this
together With a Novices
team and four or five
other teams, and the re-
sult is a wide range
(pun, pun) of activity.
For your information,
the Pistol section oper-
ates on Tuesday lunch-
times and Wednesday
evenings. Rifle shooting
occurs every other lunch-
time and Wednesday
afternoons.
In the summer, trips
are organised down to
Bisley (near Guildford)
to shoot full-bore both
for frolics and for com-
petitions.
So liven up your daily
routine with a bang or
two, come down the
range.

WHAT IS THE
a mm n > mm xsw am mm mer smr ma Mxa mar mm mar Mtw xa
CHRISTIAN
mm mm mm mm-mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mt
UNION?
The Christian Union
is a group of perhaps
eighty people from all
denominations, a n d
many nationalities, who
are united by a belief in
Jesus Christ as the Son
of God as revealed in
the Bible. So we are one
of the largest societies in
college, and one that is
growing at the moment.
What de we do?
This varies enormous-
ly but ireludes: times of
prayer; studying the
Bible together; listening
to expositions of parts of
the Bible relevant to
modern problems; an
annual houseparty with
people from other col-
leges in S W London;
General Studies lectures
(e.g. this year on Christ-
ianity and Communism);
'open meetings'; inter-
national receptions; par-
ties and outings .for
overseas students. Main
meetings each week are
held on Fridays from
6.30 p.m. in the Maths
Library, 53 Princess Gar-
dens, and all are wel-
come.
Concern leads to
action!
Our beliefs are posi-
tive and concern leads
to action and social in-
volvement. Some mem-
bers of the C U help to
run a service each week
for the patients in a local
hospital. We also seek
to help overseas rela-
tions, by helping rather
than protesting, and run
special activities and
functions for students
from other countries
who often arrive here
lonely, depressed, and
with few friends; to
make them feel webome
in a practical way. We
aren't in competition
with other societies in
this respect, and mem-
bers help in these as
they feel fit.
And the rest of Lon-
don?
Besides close ties with
colleges in S W London,
the C U is affiliated to
Unions in all the other
colleges of the Univers-
ity (with Whom there are
close connections also),
and nationally too. Des-
pite this we are a student
orientated, entirely stud-
ent-run body.
How can I join?
Full membership can
be obtained by signing a
declaration of faith, and
by actively supporting
the aims Of the Union.
There are many, but
basically to present the
claims of Jesus Christ
to people in the college,
and to form a united
body of those Who
desire to serve him
here.
All activities are open
to all members of the
College — why not get
hold of a termly pro-
gramme card from one
of the members — the
best way of finding out
about the C U is by com-
ing along and getting to
know us.
But . . .
'I go to church any-
way.*
hine, the CU isn't a
church, rather we seek
to show a working unity
between Christians Of
all backgrounds and de-
nominations in the col-
lege.
'I can't accept the
Bible.'
Meetings in Central
London on Saturday
evenings have attracted
upwards of 300 students,
who do believe it holds
the key to contemporary
(and eternal) problems
faced by man. Have you
ever considered What the
Bible says, or do you re-
ject a book you've never
read?
'As a scientist (or en-
gineer), 1 just can't
accept it."
Again we believe the
evidence to be over-
whelming, but take the
view of Prof. R. F. L.
Boyd, professor of Phy-
sics at UCL, and of
Astronomy in the Royal
Institution:
"Christianity is, in
essence a relationship,
the outcome of both an
objective historical reve-
lation (the life of Jesus)
and a contemporary, per-
sonal encounter (with
the same Jesus) . . . As
I consider the facts of
the phenomenon of
Christ, for me at any
rate, there seems to be
only one possible con-
clusion. It is the one to
which Saul the persecu-
tor came in a flash upon
the Damascus road —
God was in Christ recon-
ciling the world to him-
self", bf. 'Can God be
Known?', R. F. L. Boyd,
IVP.
'I'm not the religious
type.'
Well nor are we!
Mere escapism couldn't
turn the world upside
down in a few centuries.
For us Christianity is a
living relationship, not a
dead religion. Have you
ever considered that, as
opposed to your idea of
Christianity?
