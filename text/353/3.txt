REPRESENTATION
This year, as every year, people are trying to get
#nore people to Union Meetings (in two and a half
years at IC, I can only remember about three quorate
IJnion meetings). Many put the fault with the Left
Wing but I do not feel this is the main problem.
The Left certainly do waste a great deal of time and
effort at UGM's by their fragmenting structure, i.e.
different left wing groups putting forward what is
Basically the same view differing only in degree.
READERSHIP
'The crux of the matter, I believe, is, as was stated
by Trev Phillips at Council last Monday, that we
Have a problem of Leadership. As chairman of SCAB
I am responsible not only to Council but also to the
U G M — it actually says so in the constitution.
We have on Council, six floor reps who are there to
represent the floor of the Union. They, and other
people in positions of responsibility (here I include
myself), are content to sit back and discuss what-
ever comes up at UGMs and not actually put for-
ward the views of the membership. People at the
top are taking ego-trips and not really representing
the floor. A l l Union officers and in particular the
floor reps, should be going into the bars and coffee
areas and talking to people, all the people, and ask-
ing them what they want to see done. Then motions
would be brought to Union Meetings which concern
people and people will come and discuss them.
FLOOR REPS
We have six floor reps: John, Berry, Physics 3;
Caroline Bingham, Physics 3; Charlie Lewis, Mech
Eng 3; Paul Watkins, Mech Eng PG; Mike Williams,
Chem 3; and Nigel Sedgwick, Physics 3. They
should be asking people what they want done but if
fhey don't then the people must tell them. You are
the people, you go and make the Union leadership
sit up and listen and get their fingers out. It's your
Union and that's what it's there for.
The floor reps are in the bars most of the time so
Hell them (or any other member of Council for that
matter) what you want done. MIKE SIMMONS
LIFTS
Breakdown Procedure
1. General
There are some eighty-seven lifts in the College;
all are by law subject to regular (independent) in-
spection and maintenance. From time to time, how-
ever, lifts do inevitably suffer from defects and
breakdowns and the following paragraphs set out
the correct aption to be taken.
2. Breakdowns
«i) Until the engineer's "out of action" notice
appears by the lift, it must always be assumed
that
(a) no-one else has reported the breakdown;
(b) people are trapped in the lift.
The breakdown must be reported at once to the
Messenger or outside normal hours the Sec-
urity Guard on the building. In ordinary hours
the Messenger will ring the Buildings Office
(Maintenance) Int. Tel. No. 3954, which is
the normal 'hot-line' for service breakdowns
requiring immediate action. A n engineer will
be sent immediately to release anyone
trapped. Outside normal hours, at weekends,
during College holidays, the Messenger or
Security Guard will ring the College Opera-
tions Engineers (Int. Tel. No. 3838, GPO
589 3630) who are based on the Boiler
House. Again an engineer will be sent at once
to the lift.
If trapped in a lift, operate the alarm button.
Where possible the Messenger will acknow-
ledge this by illuminating the panel marked
"Alarm received" or some similar phrase. The
breakdown drill will bring a College engineer
to your rescue within very few minutes.
LOW TO P
3 Defects
When minor defects are notibed which do not
require immediate action (e.g. loose push-buttons,
indicator lights not working, etc.), these also should
be reported to the Messenger who will report on
the standard defects form to the Buildings Office
(Maintenance) .
4. DO NOTS
(i) Do not assume a broken down lift to be empty.
(;ii) Do not attempt to ring the lift manufacturers
direct — the maintenance of the lift is not
necessarily in his hands.
ii'H) Do not attempt to use the set of door release
and motor room keys held in every messen-
ger's box — these are for engineers only.
The report by the
Commons Select Com-
mittee on Expenditure,
entitled Postgraduate
Education', amongst oth-
er things, proposes the
introduction of post-
graduate loans, a severe
reduction in the numbers
of students allowed to
go straight on to become
PGs after a first degree,
and a requirement that
overseas students pay
full fees, amounting to
some £1,500 per annum.
The entire report is
concerned with the cost
of graduate education
rather than its nature,
and most of the propos-
als are ways of saving
money. However, behind
this, the Report Indicates
that greater Government
control over postgradu-
ate education is neces-
sary, and that PGs
should have closer links
with industry. To these
ends a central body to
control the postgraduate
sector is suggested, the
Postgraduate Advisory
Council.
The Committee be-
lieves that the majority
of PGs should not be
future academics, but
should be graduates who
have worked in industry
and who have settled in
careers, where postgrad-
uate work would be
relevant and advantage-
ous. It suggests that
industrial experience
should be a criterion for
becoming a PG. Junior
lecturers would be grad-
uates who, while lectur-
ing, are working for their
PhDs.
The report would also
remove from the Re-
search Council, the pow-
er to award Research
Fellowships. Rather more
disturbing, is the sug-
gestion that 50 per cent
of PGs in British Univer-
sities — overseas PGs
— should be fonced to
pay around £1,500 pa in
fees. This is no doubt
one way, as the commit-
tee sees it, of justifiably
reducing expenditure,
but is certain to create a
massive furore in the
Universities, b o t h
amongst the staff and
students.
It is suggested that
this report has a long
way to go before imple-
mentation. But accord-
ing to the Times Higher
Ed:
" A report from the
same committee in 1972
was soundly rebuffed by
the government last sum-
mer. This year it has
produced an account-
ant's report which may
have more appeal to an
accountant's government
which thinks little of
pursuing a course of in-
tellectual asset stripping
when the going gets
rough".
Clearly the Report is
not the last word, by
any means.
1CT Jnk
MEETING
A meeting of the
Imperial College Tenants
Association was held re-
cently. This meeting,
though not very well
attended, managed to
produce some important
decisions.
The constitution had
one or two minor amend-
ments made to it and
was then officially accep-
ted as the ICTA constit-
ution. The main changes
were the lowering of the
quorum to 75 and that
the people on rent strike
should make the deci-
sion as to where the
interest from the rent
fund should go, and also
when the strike should
finish.
Mr. Salisbury, Physics
I, presented his chair-
man's report. At the
time of the meeting there
were 67 people on rent
strike, (71 now—Ed.),
giving approximately
£3,000 in the fund.
There were as yet about
98 people to pay to
either college or the
strike fund.
It was agreed that the
next meeting of ICTA
should be held on a Sun-
day evening at 6.00 as
this seemed to be a suc-
cessful time when it was
last used.
There was a discus-
sion on the aims of
ICTA. It was pointed out
by a number of people
that ICTA did not exist
solely for the rent strike
and that it should con-
tinue when the strike is
over. T h e following
ideas were put forward
as items that I C T A
should concern itself
with: House wardens
entertainments allow-
ance, ICTA s p o r t s
league, financing of halls
and houses, affiliation
to other tenants' associ-
ations. There is, of
course, no reason why
no other items should be
considered. For more in-
formation contact Paul
Wadsworth, U n i o n
Office, or your local
ha 11/house representa-
tive (see last Felix).
It is hoped that more
people will take an inter-
est in the next meeting,
especially as it is the
intention of ICTA to re-
present and help organ-
ise anything concerned
with halls and houses.
OVERSEAS PEOPLE
People from the developing countries of Asia,
Africa and Latin America are being sought by Ox-
fam's Central London branch for a new voluntary
group designed to back up the agency's worldwide
development programme.
The group Will have two principal functions: to
advise on policies that would encourage a more
positive public attitude towards world development
and to help generate new support for Oxfam's work.
It will be one of several special groups recently set
up by Oxfam in London.
"There are many people from the Third World in
London, either studying or working, and we hope
that quite a few of them will be keen to help in a
practical way", said Oxfam organiser Jeannie
Murray. " W e don't expect them to endorse auto-
matically everything we do — in fact, we hope the
Group will produce new ideas by challenging some
of the current assumptions about development aid".
To stimulate better public understanding of de-
velopment issues, Oxfam is currently working
through four other special groups, in the travel in-
dustry, the medical and legal professions and the
Civil Service. The first Overseas Group will be limit-
ed to people living in or around London. Anyone
interested in further information should contact
Miss Jeannie Murray, Oxfam Regional Office, 12
Crane Court, Fleet Street, London EC4. Tel: 353

TOUCHSTONE
I'm always amazed when I return from a Touch-
stone weekend, how many people don't know what
I've been doing for the last day. If you fall into this
category (shame on you, you didn't read the last
report) it is basically a discussion weekend where
people can air their views on the proposed (and
more usually, the not proposed) subject, which is
so chosen so that there is no right or wrong point
of view, so people with fiery tempers beware.
This week's subject was on 'The Responsibility of
Scientists' and the speaker was Mr. Frost, a lecturer
in science studies, in the extra-mural department of
London Universities. He gave an interesting talk on
modes of thinking, mathematicological processes, the
making of distinctions, and a comparison of tech-
nology, practical science and school science in their
problems, solutions, and actions. The talk led nicely
u,p to the proposed questions for discussion which
were:
1 The comparison of scientists with other groups
regarding their concern about social difficulties aris-
ing from, and not from, their own work, their
effectiveness in initiating change and averting dan-
gers, and also of their responsibility to be respons-
ible.
2 How far disposition towards particular modes of
thinking are either present at birth, matters of free
choice, or conditioned either by social environment,
formal education arid training, or by accidents of
personal experience, and how these dispositions cor-
relate between career choice.
3 i Considering the role of the mass media in alert-
ing scientists to matters over which they may wish" to
take up responsible attitudes.
ii Should providers of formal science education ac-
cept responsibility for fostering in their pupils
(a.) responsible modes of thinking
(b) attitudes to specific situations
Hi What may or -can be done for adult scientists no
longer subject to formal education and training?

CONTACT WEEK
This week is a very
important time in the
year for many people in
and around IC — a week
of prayer, worship, and
coming together. A week
called CONTACT.
Throughout the year,
groups have been meet-
ing regularly all over the
coPlege, to share a small
part of their fives with
others. In the halls and
houses students and
)chaplains share break-
fast or coffee, and in the
departments they come
together for lunch. Each
group is very different
from the others, but in
all of them the emphasis
is on contact — with
each other, with the out-
side world, and with
God.
This week people are
coming from all over the
country to help us real-
ise what contact really
means. In many ways
they represent the out-
side world. They come
from very different back-
grounds — from an en-
gineer (ex IC) through a
housewife and a teacher
to a German Jesuit. In
other ways they repre-
sent Christ, bringing
their experience of Him
to us.
A large selection of
events has been organ-
ised for the groups to
share with each other,
but they are also meet-
ing individually with the
members of the CON-
TACT team. The events,
including a teach-in on
basic Christianity, an
award-winning film, and
a folk service and party,
are widely advertised on
yellow posters. So if you
find something that in-
terests you, or you just
want to make contact,
come along. You'll be
very welcome.
