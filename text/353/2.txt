E D [ T O R I A ,
As you may remember
from the last Felix, Mr.
Harper had sent a letter
to his M.P. Here is the
reply.
M . P . ' s
R E P L Y
Dear Rupert Harper,
Very many thanks for
your letter of the 16th
January about the pre-
sent grants available to
students. I am asking
the Secretary of State to
let me have her com-
ments on the points you
have made.
I must stress very
strongly that I believe
we must get away from
such things as rent
strikes, in order to
achieve our objectives.
It is to my mind a symp-
ton of a very unhappy
society that we should
even have to contem
plate these and not try
and settle our problems
on a more sophisticated
and reasonable basis.
Sincerely,
Richard Luce, M.P.
I have received a reply
from Mr, Fail-brother, ASTMS
secretary (see first FELIX
this term). It was late, how-
ever, due to it having been
posted in the wrong box. It
wit be printed in full in the
nest issue.
The reason that there are adverts scattered about
in this issue is that they are not being presented in
time. I M U S T have adverts, and articles by the
Monday, one week and a day before Felix is due,
i.e. Monday, 12th February for next issue. It is, of course, possible to print
articles referring to matters that happen between then and the weekend, e.g.
sports. (NB—Bob Barley is Sports Editor).
O N E person has complained that F e l x is now unreadable due to its lack of
polities. S E V E R A L have said that Felix is better than it has been for some
time, mainly due to the range of articles and lack of ultra-left wing politics.
I agree with the latter. How about you?

If You Get A
'Notice To Quit'
If you are living in pri-
vately rented accommo-
dation and do not have a
long term agreement,
then there is always the
possibility that you may
be served a "notice to
quit". What does one
do?
TRIBUNAL
Many people will tell
you there is a simple
answer — go to your
local Rent Tribunal.
They wiill usually accept
your case, cancel the
"notice to quit", and in
a few weeks' time inform
you of a hearing date at
which you and your land-
lord will get together
with the Panel of the Tri-
bunal, who Willi fix the
rent of your accommoda-
tion, and give you a se-
curity of tenure for, nor-
mally six months in the
first instance. The rent
then becomes registered
at your local Town Hall
and the landlord cannot
normally raise it for
three years; and if after
your first period of secu-
rity expires, your land-
lord servers you with
further "notice to quit"
you may apply to the Tri-
bunal for a further period
of security, although this
is less often given.
However, things don't
often work out so easily.
The Rent Tribunal may
not accept your case.
The landlord may apply
to the County Court for
an eviction order. And
then what do you do?
HARASSMENT
The first rule is that if
you want to stay, STAY.
The landlord cannot
make you ileave your ac-
commodation until he
has an eviction order.
And you Will have the
opportunity to defend
yourself in the County
Court before they decide
whether to give him an
eviction order. Neither
can the landlord With-
draw any of the facilities
during this time. This
constitutes harassment
and is illegal. But all
this is a formidable task
to handle on one's own;
so Who is there around
to help out?
HELP
At ft the local NUPE
Branch is always Wiling
to help in these matters.
In particular Bill West of
the Drains Dept. (Int.
4026), and a Senior;
Shop Steward is a useful
man to contact since fie;
is a member of the local;
Kensington Labour Party,:
and knows some of the:
Labour counciltors, Who"
are always wiling to
help out.
Alternatively, the Ken-
sington Labour Party, 92
Ladbroke Grove, North
Kensington (tel. 727
5446) has an Advice
Evening, every Monday
night from 8 p.m. at
Which the local M P and
councillors are present.
It is quite amazing
What these men can
achieve, even When for
weeks everyone else has
said that nothing can be
done. I am saying this
from first-hand experi-
ence, having been helped
at the present time by
Bill West and two Labour
councillors, one of whom
is a solicitor and is rep-
resenting us legally.
Alternatively, one can
go to Legal Aid centres,
one of Which is one Ful-
ham Road, near Fulham
Broadway and another
on Goldlborne Road in
North Kensington.
If you live in Ham-
mersmith, Les Wicks,
Metallurgy Dept. Stores'
is also a Labour Council-
lor. Alternatively, the
Conninghann Road A d -
vice Centre, 172a Con-
ning ham Road, tel. 743
6953, W12, is open
Monday to Friday, 9.30
a.m. - 4.30 p.m.; Satur-
day 9.30 a.m. to 12
noon; Monday, Wednes-
day and Thursday even-
ings 6.30 to 8 p.m.
Jo Wicks (Less wife)
can help you at the
North Hammersmith Lab-
our Party (tel. 743
2602). You can, of
course, contact these
people for any other rele-
vant problems. Use your
Iocs I government ma-
chine, you elected it.
Please keep this infor-
mation for future refer-
ence.
