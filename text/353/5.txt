EDITORIAL
A new format for P.G. News No. 9. If you haven't
seen it before, you will realise that you've been
missing out. Well, now that P.G. News has taken
over Felix (for one week, and then only if you re-
fold it to make this the front page) everyone has a
chance to see that postgrads all over College are
sitting up only to see their grants flying out of the
window. How would you like to be the first post-
grad ever to go on a demo? Find out on February
8th. You've got more to lose than anyone else.
When you've read this page, fold P.G. News so
that this is the front, and put on someone else's
desk. If you see a copy incorrectly folded, re-fold
it: Spread the word. Right. Power to the postgrad.
DEMONSTRATING
PROPOSALS
;
There shall initially cierttly large that the
be two'hourly rates: "ideal" rate be reached.
Now incorporating Felix
. (1) The "ideal" rate
Which would be paid if
the pay laws permitted.
For Session '73/'74,
this figure is £2 per hour.
(2) The " P a y Law"
rate. Which for Session
'73/'74, after November
7th is £1.15 plus 5 7 i p
for preparation time.
The "ideal" rate shall
be tied to the lower end
of the lecturers pay
scale, so that it increas-
es each year by the
same percentage as that
pay scale.
The "Pay Law" rate is
the maximum pay a l -
lowed by the pay board
for demonstrating.
Initially, demonstrat-
ors will be paid at the
"pay law' rate. We pro-
pose that the College
automatically apply to
the pay board (or its
successor) every year on
October 1st for an in-
crease which will bring
the effective rate up to
the "ideal rate". We
Will accept a lower rate
only if it is the maxi-
mum rate allowed by the
pay 'board.
In the following cir-
cumstances the pay-
ment for demonstrating
will revert to the "ideal"
rate:
(1) If the pay laws are
abolished.
(2) if the pay laws
allow an increase suffi-
Preparation time.
The College is con-
cerned that if the rate of
£2 plus annual incre-
ments is paid, in future
years there will be an-
other claim for prepara-
tion time. We therefore
agree that the "ideal"
rate is an amount suffi-
ciently high that a re-
sponsible demonstrator
will come to a practical
well prepared and will
be willing to help a stud-
ent outside his/her hours
of employment.
But
that:
we recognise
(1) It must always re-
main negotiable that
preparation time be paid
in respect of a situation
where a greater than
normal amount of pre-
paration is necessary.
(2) Tutoring, because
it requires much more
preparation than demon-
strating should normally
be paid at twice the
normal rate for demon-
strating.
It should be noted in
this context that prepar-
ation time is only
normally 50 per cent,
and can be higher in
certain circumstances.
(3) W e consider that
the setting up of experi-
ments does not constit-
ute normal preparation
and should be paid
separately.

A Government re-
port was published
on Wednesday 23rd
of Jan. which, if im-
plemented, will have
a fundamental effect
on Postgraduate
education.
The education and
arts sub-committee of
the Expenditure Com-
mittee, made up of
members from all three
main parties in the
House of Commons, pro-
poses that there should
be radical changes in
the system of Postgrad-
uate education and that
Postgraduates should be
financed by loans. The
report makes some valid
criticisms Of the present
system, but its main
thesis is that Postgrad,
education should be
more cost-effective and
should be tailored to the
needs of Government
and Industry. To this
end the present grants
system would be abol-
ished and replaced by
either Government or
commercially financed
loans — in addition the
number of students
would be cut back. The
role of independent Un-
iversity research is
largely ignored, and
Postgraduate education
is envisaged in terms of
providing refresher cour-
ses and specialist train-
ing for students on
release from Industry. In
conclusion the report
states that suCh a sys-
tem would help contain
public expenditure and
promote equality of op-
portunity (sic).
LOANS
IMPLEMENTATION
SOON
If the proposals are
implemented Postgrad-
uates will be virtually in
the position of paying
for Tine privilege of
parrying out research. In
most countries training
in research is treated as
employment and paid
for as such. The recom-
mendations of the report
should be seen as yet
another attack on a
higher education system
which is already biased
against students from
working class families.
The Government prob-
ably thinks that it can
establish the principle of
loan financing by attack-
ing the sector which is
traditionally least organ-
ised. Next perhaps will
be loans for Under-
graduates. PGs should
demonstrate their total
opposition to any pro-
posals for changes in the
Postgraduate education
system which involve
loan finance.
EXPLOITATION OF
THIRD WORLD
The proposals include
the recommendation that
fees for overseas stud-
ents should be increased
to cover the full cost of
their courses. This
would mean an increase
from £ 2 5 0 to around
£1,500.
(The ICPGG is obtain-
ing several copies of the
report which is entitled
'Third Report from the
Expenditure Committee,

Committee, Session

Education, Volume 1.

STOP
PRESS
The seriousness with
which postgraduates
throughout the country
are viewing the report of
the Commons Expendi-
ture Committee is illus-
trated by the fact that
HMSO sold out two
days after publication.
(How many did they
print?).
L O N D O N
P . G . G R O U P
The group was formed
in November 1973 as a
result of the growing
activity among Post-
graduates throughout
the University on issues
si_fch as demonstrating
payments and the grants
campaign. Since that
time meetings have been
regular, and have been
used to co-ordinate
action in the colleges
and to provide informa-
tion and ideas for the
College based groups.
At the most recent meet-
ing on 17th January,
several Colleges report-
ed that their demonstraft-
ing rates had been
raised (along with Im-
perial's) to £1.15, a rise
of 15 pence. There is a
small hope of getting
this payment increased
slightly by exploiting
one of the Pay Board
clauses on anomalies,
but given the present
strength and organisa-
tion of the Postgraduate
movement, most dele-
gates agreed that the
best approach was to
negotiate agreements
With College authorities
to take effect as soon as
wage restraint is ended.
YOUR GRANT
By N.U.S.
—if it still exists in '75
The claim is based on the 1968 undergraduate
grant, raised according to the NUS student cost
index. The Board and Lodging costs are based o n
London. The NUS claim for undergraduates is £770
for London, Oxford and Cambridge students and
£ 6 5 5 for others. This latter figure is similar to the
amount put forward by the C V C P . The present figure
is £695, next year it could be nothing.
The PG Claim (in fact the claim for all students
Who require 44 weeks or more attendance) is based
on the UG claim and is broken down as follows:
UG£ PG£ PG/UG Element
Ratio
61.28 13.95 5/22 Vacation
66.11 103.57 47/30 Course
