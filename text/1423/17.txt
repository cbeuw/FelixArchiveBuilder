Well done to team Shotgun for
winning last week. I am actually far
too happy. Really I am. If the rest of
you want to get answers in I will be
even happier. Really, I love felix.
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Shotgun were again last week’s
winners, underlining the fact that
theyhavenofriends.Howeverfor
the rest of you, the hidden word
was ‘DIRTYSLAG’. The offer of
a flaky white Bounty bar for all
correct answers still stands.
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.

Going Underground
Last week, MÖchten sie mein Man-
schaft snow ploughed their way to vic-
tory by finding WIMBLEDON PARK.
This week it’s much shorter... partly
due to the snow causing delays. To my
brain. And topically to the whole of the
Underground system.
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk

Snow, snow, fuck-
ing snow. Next time
someone tells me how
fucking icy it is walking
into College I’m not go-
ing to ram yellow snow
down their throat, oh no. It’ll be bloodcurdling
burgundy snow sprinkled with a dash of semen
for salty seasoning. And if you don’t suck it dry
I’m going to come round your house and bite your
fucking goldfishes’ eyes out. You cock stubble.
Libra
Have you seen this
man? Have you
heard him singing?
This man likes to
lure children to his
lair, and not to play
Snakes & Ladders.
Not in that way at least.
If you know his whereabouts, head to www.
kiddyfiddler.com to verify his identity and
then call us. This monster must be stopped.
Capricorn
You spend most of the
early part of this week
stumbling about in
the snow. Well done
to you. Unfortunately
you slipped and had a
metal road sign tear through your jeans. Right up
your arsehole – destroying your internal organs
in the process. You crawl to hospital with severe
internal bleeding and a ‘caution men working
overhead’ sign hanging out of your arse. Pint?
Sagittarius
This week you decide
you hate Peter Sinclair.
Good, I always
thought he was a cunt
too. Here’s what you’re
going to do about it:
fill a bath full of caustic soda, chop his toes off,
one-by-one before dipping each stub into the
bubbling, fuming liquid. Then smash his face in
with an anvil before eating an omelette off his
mum’s axe-gash whilst he watches.
Cancer
I overran. Fucking
sue me you cunt. Eat
a chlamydia infected
clunge please. Now,
jog on. Moron.
Gemini
Every This week
you write a shitty
column extolling
yet more drivel
about how sexually
liberated you are.
During the throes of passion with your latest
female conquest – after all you are a closet-
lesbian – a bad-AIDs infected barb protrudes
from her navel gouging both your eyes out at
once. She then drives your face through the
bed post before ‘going scissors.’ You fucking
love it you dirty, dirty queen. The vixen isn’t
finished there though. Legs thoroughly
apart, she rams 89 hot cow prods into each
of your size-16 thighs before urinating all
over your festering corpse. Die. Die. DIE.
Leo
ROAR! ROOOOAR!
That’s the sound of
me on the prowl.
Hello ladies. Why
yes, I would like
to investigate your
crevices – thanks for throwing yourself at my
feet. If you’d like some hot one-on-one action
with this manifestation of manly machismo,
send a self-addressed pair of knickers to the
felix office so I can smell your innocence.
Taurus
You’re clambering
up the stairs in
Blackett because
the lift has broken.
‘Three Perish
in Blackett Lift
Plummet’ scream the headlines in felix.
“Inconsiderate cunts dying,” you think “making
me take the stairs.” Your bowels implode. You
fall over the bannister plunging six floors.
Blood. Faeces. Massive shit infused damage.
Aries
And look here!
A wild Jiffy-bag
grazing on the
luscious green
pastures of a fertile
Pritt-Stick. O
glorious amazement! But wait! What’s this?
A Golden Stapler soaring through the skies
swoops down engulfing the Jiffy in its sharp,
pointed claws – its prey fighting a futile battle.
All is lost. Life has expired. Silence.
Pisces
I know a certain
person who writes
an angry geeky
column for the
paper. I have got to
say if I shat on the
page and then swirled it with a stick it would
be an improvement. What gives you the right
to inflict your unimaginative, mind-numbing
boring SHIT onto us. If only you had half a
brain you might be as intelligent as a goldfish.
Aquarius
This week you will
be curled up on
your kitchen floor
shivering, You’re
going cold turkey
and desperately need
some coke. You look out of the window and
see that the whole of London is covered in a
white fluffy substance. With a shriek you grab a
shovel, run outside and create a 3m line in your
garden. You die of pneumonia. Fuck tard.
Well done to last week’s winner Enoch.
Yes, he is the brain box who actually
formulates the crosswords. But is he
allowed to enter considering he wrote
it? Well yes, he bloody well is. You’re
all fucking idiots. Why don’t you write
in to me? You know how hard it is if
I have to answer the fucking thing be-
fore I can put the solution in? Well I
shall tell you. Very. This man does not
have a normal sized brain – he makes
cryptic clues for fucks sake! It’s not just
a time thing, there are iPods at stake
here... and Bounty bars! That’s choco-
late and music. Fuck it. I’ll even throw
in a dirty hooker. What more of an
incentive do you need? I understand
if the editor-in-chief scares you, but
don’t worry. We have brought him a
muzzle this week as he keeps on biting
the Arts Editors. If I don’t get answers
this week, someone will get smashed in
the genitals. I don’t care if you are a girl.
Right that’s it. Anyone who sends me a
correct fucking answer who is not in a
team gets 100 points. Now piss off.
