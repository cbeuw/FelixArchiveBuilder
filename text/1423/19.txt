ICHC men’s 1st XI have consistently
been one of the strongest teams in Lon-
don, even though they have recently
produced poor performances against a
host of medical students. As the say-
ing goes, a good team wins when they
play badly. This has certainly been true
over the last few weeks but the ability
of the team to put games to bed has
been invaluable.
Last week, the grudge match be-
tween IC and IC Medicals was timed
perfectly before the big varsity day on
February 25th. A strong start by Impe-
rial saw many goal chances pass by. A
super run by BJ on his debut for the
1st XI made a mockery of the medical
defences and a superb finish saw the
crowd go wild.IC ‘Allez Voued’ after
the Frenchman’s goal, which was add-
ed to by a rebounded short corner by
the German, Koch. The medicals put
a brave fight and scored a wonderfully
worked move in addition to a decent
short corner routine.
The Englishmen decided that we
could not depend on these foreigners
anymore and Diana took advantage of
a penalty flick decision with Yogi Bear
providing the killer 4th goal blow. Final

Hockey men’s 1sts continue their
dominance in ULU and BUCS
score 4-2.
At the weekend the winning mo-
mentum continued on a cold and
rather bleak day. Against a team who
have only won a couple of matches all
season, the game was over before it
began.
A couple of goals in quick succession
confirmed this! Although a couple of
goals were conceded during the bliz-
zard that covered the pitch in a light
layer of snow, the game finished on a
high with short corner routines and
set pieces flowing well. Strong per-
formances in the midfield by Krusty,
Diana and Dennis proved invaluable
during the match with a the defence
and attack dealing with their jobs well
considering the conditions. Avtar the
great debriefed and DR gave his usual
passionate team talk in preparation
for the big game against Canterbury
Christ Church, although it was later
postponed due to the accumulation of
snow! Final score 6-2.
The team is now working towards
the triple – as defending ULU Cup
champions and strong performances
in both the ULU and BUCS leagues
in the last couple of years the stage is
set for the men’s elite to become even
more so. Watch this space!

Revenge is sweet as the Miners
dominate Imperial College FC 7’s
Steve Meunier
Many people would have forgiven the
RSM players for feeling they had a
point to prove after the way that they
were laid into by the Imperial captain
following the previous encounter, and
the ensuing view that the RSM teams
among others were not needed.
It turned out that this was helped
along by the Imperial team, with a
lack of organisation resulting in them
finding themselves with only 10 play-
ers half an hour after the game was
meant to have started while the RSM
players kept themselves warm. The
game started at 11 vs 10 and RSM
were quick to take control, with good
runs from Christian and Danny the
two wingers. It didn’t take long for
the possession to take an effect when
captain, Steve Meunier won a free
kick out on the right hand side which
was delivered with deadly accuracy by
Matt W for Steve to glance into the far
post with only 5 minutes gone. It was
at one nil that Imperials illusive 11th
player turned up but he showed little
urgency to get onto the pitch, spending
another 10 minutes on the sideline get-
ting changed. This proved to be very
costly as the over confident IC con-
tinued to play with three at the back
and they were punished again on the
counter attack when a great run from
Johnny ended with a selfless lay off to
Matt who calmly slotted home to make
the score 2.0. IC were now up to 11
players, and they tried to break down
a solid defence with most of the pos-
session coming down the left flank but
usually ending with a dominant Ez at
right back cleaning up constantly.
Owen and Alex judged the wind per-
fectly and controlled any balls over the
top and RSM faithful Andy was solid
as ever at the left back position. Hard
as they tried IC could not get into the
box and had few shots of any kind, with
keeper Rowan having little to do but
clear up over hit long balls. Half time
came with RSM deservedly 2:0 up.
Half time saw the replacement of an
injured Johnny with Jon and IC started
in a fashion that summed up their per-
formance, in kicking the ball into touch
almost straight from kick off. It was IC
however who had a share of the pos-
session and were able to claw one back
when a player who appeared not to be
from the 7’s, but from a higher ranked
team, found himself unmarked from a
corner to nod home.
Where RSM teams of old may have
folded under the growing pressure,
today it seemed to wake them up once
again and the reaction was almost in-
stant with Jon firing into the side net-
ting and then 5 minutes later, finding
the post. RSM had found another gear
and with the exception of a couple of
corners, IC were unable to cause any
more problems. Subs Fabrizio and
James worked well down the right and
Matt and Stu were controlling the mid-
dle of the park.
The game was put beyond doubt
when Jon, who had come so close ear-
lier on, chipped and rounded his man
and then lobbed the advancing keeper
with 8 minutes to go. The game was
seen out by a dominant RSM team who
deserved the three points and move up
a place as a result.
This was the perfect response to ear-
lier criticism and also a great start to
the run into the bottle match, which
takes place at the end of February.
