The new creative
generation
T
he 1960s saw a renaissance
of cultural creativity in al-
most every media, from
music to art to philoso-
phy. Rock bands put down
the surf-boards and stopped grooming
their side-partings in favour of adopt-
ing a more progressive attitude to what
their music could be about, and what
it could mean to the people listening.
The entire creative output of a genera-
tion united around the idea that soci-
ety didn’t actually have to be a slippery
slope of individualism and social isola-
tion – it could never be perfect, but it
didn’t have to be so shit.
The philosophical nature of pop-cul-
ture development died on its ass short-
ly after the hippies all got jobs but their
generation had been defined by its ide-
alism. Future generations wouldn’t be
so lucky. Recessions in the 1970s rav-
aged the country and the children of
this time became the punks, partly as
a reaction to the dire greyness of that
era. Cue the ‘80s when the rigorous so-
cial mechanisation of Thatcherism was
mirrored by the disjointed, inorganic
sounds of its pop musicians, much be-
loved by the nouveau-cool of today.
This is where most accounts end. The
1990s are notable only in their lack of
any one defining musical movement.
Self-conscious, flavour-of-the-month
mini-revolutions took place in the
form of grunge, rave, rap-metal – they
produced good music at times, but
lacked any real mental longevity. And
here we are today, children of the MTV
generation, lacking a common musical
purpose, a rallying point, a ‘We Were
There’ moment.
However human creativity is a tough
one to stifle and, if you can entertain
the thought, I would argue that we
(that is, people of our generation with
special emphasis on the people of Im-
perial College London) are at the cusp,
or even in the throws of a musical rev-
olution unlike any which has come be-
fore. A revolution not based on shared
social values as in the ‘60s, or a shared
sense of despair as in the ‘70s, but
based rather on the technology which
is now available to us. Music-making
technology has come a long way since
the hyper-awareness of the synthesiser
movement of the ‘80s, when people
were actually trying to make music
which sounded like it was made by a
robot. Now, making music with the aid
of a computer has become the norm in
most genres of pop and on the creative
edge of this transition, people are using
it to free the mind from any of the im-
posed constraints of instrumentation
or practicalities of arrangement.
When writing music for two guitars,
bass and drums, an infinity of musical
avenues are instantly blocked. When
making music on a computer, people
have virtually instant access to every
frequency, every texture, and even the
most abstract samples of sci-fi cartoons
from their childhood. As human-com-
puter interfacing becomes a hot area of
development, the mind becomes free
to accurately express its variety and
breadth. Watching someone playing
around on Q-Bass who really knows
their way around it is mind-blowing.
The new musical paradigm shift will
not be started by poncy art-school
know-it-alls, but by scientists, engi-
neers, technologists, people who learn
computer languages in their spare
time, people who own calculators that
can do graphs. Embrace the knowl-
edge, Imperial College. You’ve got to
stay in school to keep it cool.
Pavement remastered
What’s on: IC Radio this week
Pavement
Brighten The Corners: Nicene
Creedence Edition
Domino
HHHHH
James Houghton
In their native America, Pavement release all of their music under the name ‘Sidewalk’
Forget Nelson Mandela’s release from
jail and Leslie Nielsen’s birthday, Febru-
ary the 11th is only important for one
thing; next Wednesday is the twelfth
anniversaryofthereleaseofPavement’s
Brighten the Corners. Every two years,
since the band’s demise eight years
ago, Domino have been pumping out
deluxe reissues of Pavement’s albums
in chronological order and December
saw the release of the latest: Brighten
the Corners: Nicene Creedence Edition.
The 2-CD, forty-four track long mon-
ster contains a remastered version of
the original album along with every
B-side / compilation track / previously
unheard live and studio track from the
period of the original release.
The original album takes its place as
the first 12 songs on the box set and re-
ally needs no introduction. Whilst ar-
guably their most accessible and con-
sistent album, it still has the trademark
“Forget Nelson
Mandela’s
release from
jail and Leslie
Nielsen’s
birthday”
Pavement feel: slightly shambolic, light
and excited but totally perfect in its
mess and never unplanned. Album
opener ‘Stereo’ starts with Steve Mal-
kmus telling us that “Pigs, they tend to
wiggle when they walk” in an almost
child-like manner, setting the light-
hearted tone that prevails through the
majority of the songs, maintaining an
incredibly fun and catchy feel with-
out becoming corny or clichéd. This
is a great starting place for those yet
to be enlightened, although die-hard
fans won’t be overly impressed by the
remastering which has had minimal
effect upon the overall sound of the
album – it is slightly louder than the
original perhaps, but it’s barely notice-
able and not enough to cause any sub-
stantial clipping or distortion.
The inclusion of a huge amount of
additional B-sides and rare songs will
get Pavement fan-boys hot under the
collar. Eighteen of the extra thirty-two
songs are all previously unreleased and
the CDs come with a 62-page book
(which was missing from my promo
copy unfortunately, so I can only guess
what’sinit).Thereissueisworthbuying
exclusively for the Spit On A Stranger
B-side ‘Harness Your Hopes’ which
is as good, if not better, than most of
the original album tracks. It’s hard to
understand why they would leave such
an excellent song off the album, but
then Pavement were never predictable.
As Steve Malkmus sings “Show me /
A word that rhymes with pavement
/ And I won’t kill your parents / And
roast them on a spit”, it’s hard to stop
that smile spreading across your face
and his lyrical and rhyming style make
sure that it stays there throughout the
whole album. A few of the songs on the
second disc (see ‘Neil Hagarty Meets
Jon Spencer in a Non-Alcoholic Bar’
and ‘It’s a Rainy Day, Sunshine Girl’)

Twenty years after its release, James Houghton listens to the
rejigged edition of Pavement’s Brighten the Creedence
aren’t particularly special or interest-
ing but then with such a huge amount
of songs there’s always going to be a
couple which don’t standout.
For Pavement fans this is definitely
a worthy inclusion in your collection.
If you’re new to the band, the Nicene
Creedence Edition is still worth buy-
ing. It’s not particularly pricey and
although it’s dauntingly track-heavy,
the original 12 tracks and the ‘Spit On
A Stranger’ B-sides make it the per-
fect start to this incredibly influential
band’s back catalogue.
