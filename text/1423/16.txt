A
terrible thing happened
this week! My iPhone
went broke. Now I real-
ise that that isn’t a sen-
tence, but it went broke
real bad. Now let me explain why this
is such a big deal. My phone is basically
my life (apart fr, now people say this all
the time, but in my case I can definitely
tell you it’s true. For the 24 hours I was
without a phone, I was completely cut
off from the outside world. I couldn’t
speak to my friends, colleges, contrac-
tors... anyone! The silence was not wel-
come, especially since this has been a
pretty busy week. Being busy means
lots of phone calls, e-mails and texts.
Something quite important. That was a

dark time people. All my iPhone would
say is “No Service”. I’m like “what the
fuck do you mean no service?” Thank-
fully I was saved by the apple man.
More specifically, the man at the apple
store who kindly changed my iPhone
over for free. Awesomez!!! Admittedly I
expected it to be swapped for free, but
only after a struggle with upper man-
agement. However this was a pain free
and easy process. Would you know it,
my phone is all fine again, and I can fi-
nally call Kadhim Shubber after about
eight weeks of avoiding contact. Well
maybe I’ll give it a week, but I can fi-
nally go out with the piece of mind that
I have my phone if I need it. You know,
to call the police, or a hitman.
I can haz
iPhone?

Well, that snow was certainly very ex-
citing, but something that is equally if
not more exciting is the Annual RCC
Nighthike; one crazy night of clue find-
ing, adventurous walking and hope-
fully a bit of map reading- but if you
can’t don’t let that put you off. All this
is happening on the night of 28th Feb-
ruary, and it’s now possible to get more
information or sign up your team by
logging on to our website www.union.
ic.ac.uk/rcc/nighthike.
To get you psyched in the mean time
we’ve got a tantalising taster for you
here in the daylight safety of college-
all you have to do is answer the clues,
which are all located in places acces-
sible to everyone in the college, so no
excuses.
Last week, to tie in with the launch of
the Science Challenge, we brought you
questions from various science build-
ings so it is only fair that this week is
for the Engineers. Here it goes…
Aero Eng: What position was Sir
RCC Nighthike Quizzy Wizzy
Roderic Hill in the RAF & what years
was he rector?
RSM: By the ornate entrance, there
are two stone carvings of heads- but
who are they?
Mech Eng: Which rector placed the
plaque in the case of the clock in the
Mech Eng Foyer?
EEE: What floor is the balcony on?
Skempton (Civ Eng): What ‘friendly’
sign is directly above the main
entrance?
And now it’s like Jeopardy (the games
show) where we’ll tell you the answers
from last week’s Quizzy Wizzy:
Blackett Laboratory: Diamond
Biochemistry entrance: Sir Derek
Barton & Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson
Chemistry: 6 July 1993
Huxley: Biology
RCS1: Descartes, Galileo, Copernicus
Another epic fail. This guy is shit
Strawberry? Military Secret Weapon No. 179 Lego Newton Seriously whadafuh? Nice!
