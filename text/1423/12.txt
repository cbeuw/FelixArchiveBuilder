Miss the snow? Don’t worry,
there’s plenty in these films
For those of you who are now house-
bound because of the uncharacteris-
tic snowstorms that are obliterating
the country, this Film Editor decided
to write an article featuring films in
which the glorious phenomenon we
call ‘Snow’ is heavily featured, or is an
important plot point. The main reason
for this being that felix enjoys being
topical but also because we are aware
that while you are curled up snug and
warm in your beds/sofas you have to
do something – essays and university
work do not count because when you
are given an unexpected day off you
better make the most of it – so what
better activity than brushing up on
your film knowledge! Any excuse for
watching films is a good excuse! An-
other reason for this article is because
I was meant to go to the cinema to re-
view the latest films – but got snowed
in! So instead of seeing something
new, I blew the dust off of some of
my old favourites: films that made me
feel seasonal but not Christmassy, sat
down in front of a roaring Tesco value
heater (poor students can’t afford real
fireplaces – but hopefully one day we
will!). So here are a few suggestions;
I
received the following last week:
“Film Cynic Clinic, I am ill.
Lurching. I struggle to com-
prehend the worth of your ar-
ticle. You begin by bemoaning
the arrogance of the English speaking
community, its ignorance of foreign
culture. Then personify this stereo-
type by demonstrating your confusion
between art house and world cinema.
This warped understanding of interna-
tional media appauls me. I cough and
gag, aren’t you supposed to be a film
critic? Your article bears the stench of
the typical felix nobody, the writer who
has nothing to say but wants everyone
to hear it anyway. I spit a gooey flem-
ball of judgement upon your name.
Towards the other articles in this
section, I am apathetic. They are bor-
ing, neatly written vacuums of incite.
Reviews of the same mainstream films
as the Metro and London Lite. Shudder
and baulk. Isn’t this supposed to be
a student paper? Where is the youth,
where is the invention? Godammit,
shake it up a bit! I am by no means a
film expert, but here are a few viewing
suggestions:
Let the Right One in (2008) – A
hazy Swedish thriller, it creeps and
tiptoes around you, drawing you in.
Ghoulish.
Angels of the Universe (2000) – As
bleak and spiritual as the land it’s set
in, one man’s decent into the realms of
the insane. As depressing as the Anton
Corbijns 2007 movie, Control. Iceland
plays hard-ball with the black dog.

Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001) – This
playfully sour drama has a fantastic
ending. Passionate Mexican emotion
at it’s best.
The Return (2003) – Breathtaking
scenery. Probe the levels to uncover
a pure Russian psyche driving this fa-
ther-son drama. Authentic.
Four Shades of Brown (2004) – This
epic saga depicts some of Sweden’s
quirkier individuals, wracks you from
hilarity to speechlessness in seconds.
Watch in two halves if you have to, but
a must-see.
So please stop printing crap. If I want
someone to piss in my eyes, I’ll hide in
Jabba the Hutt’s toilet.” Bad Taste
I had two reasons to print the com-
ment. Firstly, I liked the movies which
Bad Taste recommends and wanted
to share that recommendation with
our readers. Secondly, I really liked
Bad Taste’s style of writing; he uses a
plethora of adjectives (let’s just hope
he knows the nice ones too), attempts
to be funny and is absolutely clueless
about the hypocrisy that oozes out of
his piece. So now I’m appealing public-
ly to Bad Taste – send a review in, write
something that you believe is worth
reading and (here comes the corny bit)
be the change that you want to see. The
fact that you’re a prick doesn’t mean I
will not print your reviews.
On an end note, I have to laugh at
how educating it is to be on the receiv-
ing end of a scathing comment. I just
might give some slack to crappy film
directors and producers from now on.
Constructive
criticism?
The Shining
Snowedinatahauntedhotelinwhich
the ghosts have made house-sitter Jack
Nicholson insane. You better grab an
axe before he does and get chopping,
or you will end up in the spooky photo
of the dead that concludes this freaky
chiller.
Snowy moments include running
through a huge hedge maze in the
freezing cold, trekking across hills to
save the family and someone being fro-
zen to death. Any film that can make
snow seem ominous is guaranteed to
make you scared.
Snowy Day rating: 5/5
Cool Runnings
Will four Olympic athletic failures
be able to overcome adversity and tri-
umph as the first-ever Jamaican bob-
sled team? I think most of us know the
answer to that question, but this film is
still worth a watch because it is a heart-
warming classic.
Snowy moments include sitting in an
ice-cream van to prepare for the cold,
finally arriving in Canada and feeling
the cold and the unavoidable fact that
this is about the winter Olympics.
Snowy Day rating: 3/5
Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless
Mind
A couple break up but instead of
moving on, they both have their mem-
ories erased. This amazing romance/
drama makes the most of both Jim
Carey and Kate Winslet and by the
end if you aren’t sobbing into your pil-
low, then you have a heart made of ice.
This is a great film to watch, even if
you don’t like chick flicks, as it is very
unconventional.
Snowy Moments include the main
characters falling in love on a fro-
zen lake and having a snow fight on a
beach.
Snowy Day rating: 2/5
30 Days Of Night
Just as a small Alaskan town is pre-
paring for a month without sunlight,
a pack of murderous vampires set up
camp and feast on everyone living
there. Only a small band of survivors
can try to fend off the vampires – but
will they survive the 30 days of night?
A film for horror fans and those of you
who prefer dark (both literally and
figuratively) plots, this film delivers in
both shocks and suspense.
Snowy Moments include people be-
ing slaughtered on the snow, blood
splattering the snow, a snowmobile
churning vampires onto the snow…
you get the drift…
Snowy Day rating: 4/5
Groundhog Day
When weatherman Phil (Bill Murray)
gets stuck in the same day, unable to es-
cape the small town of Punxsutawney
because of a blizzard that he predicted
wouldn’t be there, hilarity, as well as a
few life lessons, ensue. February 2nd
was Groundhog Day; so if you weren’t
sad enough like me to actually remem-
ber and watch it on the day, then make
sure you see this as soon as you can,
because it is an excellent film.
Snowy moments include Phil stuck
in a snowy traffic jam on a motor-
way, having plenty of snowball fights,
ice-sculpting, and of course the beau-
tiful snow-angel sculpture of Andie
MacDowell.
Snowy Day rating: 5/5
Die Hard 2
Can John McClane (Bruce Willis)
battle insane terrorists once again, this
time at an airport covered in snow,
who wish to crash aeroplanes filled
with innocent people unless their de-
mands are met? Although this is not
the best Die Hard, it is still very good
and includes lots of action scenes and
witty remarks from our hero. SPOILER
WARNING: Do not watch this film if
you have a fear of aeroplane crashes! I
hate to say it but us English don’t make
it (why couldn’t they kill Americans –
why us??). Snowy Moments include
John running across a snow-filled
runway, murdering someone with an
incredibly large and sharp icicle, and
numerous snowstorms.
Snowy Day rating: 4/5
Iron Will
I had to have a Disney movie some-
where, didn’t I? But this feel-good tale
about overcoming the odds contains
lots of snow, as it is about a young
teenager who heroically joins a dog-
sled race to win money for his family.
Based on a true story, those of you who
love feel-good films will enjoy this,
especially because it is hard to know
if he will win the race or not. Kevin
Spacey also makes an appearance as
a scene- stealing, morally-challenged
journalist.
Snowy Moments include… well, this
is a film about a sled race in Canada.
Snowy Day rating: 4/5
Selected James Bond Films
James Bond is well known for his
escapades around the globe and some-
times he comes across a rather peril-
ous snowy situation that he has to ski
out of. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service
is probably the wintriest Bond film, as
it is mostly set in a ski resort, but The
World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day,
A View To A Kill, For Your Eyes Only
and The Spy Who Loved Me all have
snow-bound action scenes. I am sure
others do, but these films also happen
to be great Bond films anyway.
Snowy moments include: Bond ski-
ing down a bobsleigh track, Bond be-
ing chased across a glacier by a beam of
sunlight (yes, you read that correctly),
Bond being chased whilst skiing (this
happens a lot, and I mean a lot), and a
sexy scene in an Arctic submarine.
Snowy Day rating: 3/5
Kate Winslet as the ‘Cookie Monster’ enjoying subzero temperatures.
Mackenzie Astin races through
Canada to save his family... sob...
Anybody? Nope? Ok I’ll do it,
“heeeres Johnny!”
