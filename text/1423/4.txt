here is a conundrum that
plagues the minds of all
scientificallyactive12-year
olds. How can somebody
pull the tablecloth from a
fully laid table, without breaking any
of the plates or glasses? Do not scoff, I
understand that you think the answer’s
easy but for 12-year olds and Business
school students it poses something of
a headache.
Thank goodness for the Science Mu-
seum therefore, last Saturday they had
an actor dressed as the esteemed Sir
Isaac Newton explaining to a group of
12-year olds (I don’t know if any Busi-
ness school students were there but I
didn’t see any Blackberrys) explaining
Newton’s laws of motion and, along the
way, the tablecloth trick.
The first law of motion didn’t pose
very much trouble. An object moving
with constant velocity or at rest, will
continue to move with a constant ve-
locity or remain at rest until a net force
is applied. This is pretty easy to dumb
down for a gaggle of innocent kids
and offered me the rare opportunity
to sound knowledgable about Physics;
damn you genius 2nd year Physicists.
To demonstrate, he dropped an ap-
ple, initially at rest, to the floor. What
makes the apple fall to the Earth? he
asked. “Gravity” I proudly declared be-
fore my 12-year old opponents. What
is gravity? he continued. “A force” I
responded to the annoyance of many a
parent and their increasingly dejected
children.
Satisfied that the group had under-
stood, but bemused by the presence of
a 6ft 3 sleep-deprived student, Fake Sir
Isaac Newton continued to the 2nd law
of motion which he unconvincingly
described as ‘his’. The force applied
to an object is linked to its mass and
acceleration by the formula. I decided
not to risk “death by angry parent” and
remained silent as Fake Sir Issac New-
ton did his very best to make a group
of twelve year old boys interested in an
equation. Noticing his lack of success
he swiftly moved on.
The final of Newton’s laws and the
perfect excuse for a grown man in a
wig to stand on a skateboard. Every ac-
tion creates an equal and opposite re-
action. He stood on the skateboard and
demonstrated that when he pushed
the ground with his foot, the ground
pushed himself and the skateboard in
the opposite direction. Hurrah! The
beauty of Physics shown with a sim-
plicity that a 12 year old could connect
with.
Next demonstration, he jumped
on the spot. What provided the force
that pushed him into the air? he ques-
tioned the audience. A flurry of tiny
hands rose which consecutively pro-
vided the same, wrong answer “Your
legs”. A rather larger hand, mine, rose
and correctly responded with as much
superiority as one can obtain from
being smarter than a twelve year old,
“the ground beneath you”. Another
success for Imperial College London,
I thought.
Next, a rocket (or rather a balloon).
The air coming out of the balloon
pushes on the air in the room, which
pushed back on the balloon causing it
to fly crazily around the Science Mu-
seum, the actor explained. Even I felt
like I was learning something… Well
maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration I
think (or at least I hope) but still, I felt
like a new generation of Physicists was
being nurtured around me.
If only Fake Sir Isaac Newton had
stopped there, I might have come away
with a positive view of the dumbing
down of science for children. But alas
he did not. To finish, he addressed the
conundrum of the tablecloth trick,
albeit less dramatically with an apple.
Why did the apple remain station-
ary on the table when not interefered
with? ‘Newton’s 1st law’ a blond-haired
boy piped up. Ah they were learning!
But then why didn’t the apple move
when Fake Sir Isaac Newton suddenly
snatchedtheclothfrombeneaththeap-
ple? Mmm, this was more complicated.
Wouldn’t the removal of the cloth gen-
erate a force which would create an ac-
celeration which would cause the apple
to move? the actor taunted us. I sensed
that if an answer wasn’t forthcoming
the children’s brains would overheat
and shut down. I was ready to exclaim
“INERTIA!” when crisis was averted
and Fake Sir Isaac Newton obliged us.
“The bumps on the apple, interact
with the bumps on the cloth. When
the cloth is removed, the interactions
between the bumps cause the apple to
rise so that the cloth can slip out from
under it. Then the apple falls back to
the table.”
Levitation? Instead of explaining
inertia, this man decided that levita-
tion was a more appropriate tool for
teaching children the basics of classical
physics. This wasn’t simplification or
dumbing down but simply a lie. With-
out sounding too indignant, if even the
Science Museum can’t keep children
interested enough in science without
using Harry Potteresque explana-
tions, then what hope is there for over-
worked teachers and science-illeterate
parents?
Before you know it, the Science
Museum will tell us that electricity is
caused by gnomes, hundreds of tiny
gnomes ‘high-fiving’ each other and
running around swapping messages.
Frankly, Ladies and Gentlemen, we
are doomed…

here is something wretch-
ed about this city’s soul
and it spreads its woe with
all the vigour of a pesti-
lence. Everywhere I feel
the lash of clockwork’s tyranny upon
my back. My senses grow numb from
the inhaled vapours of nihilistic odours
that throttle me like chlorine. London
depletes my spirit, gnaws upon my
virtues. London whispers of the death
of dreams, makes exhibits of medioc-
rity. London makes machines of men,
builds hearts from cogs and gears. It is
the graveyard of poets.
All too frequently in this winter sea-
son I am woken at a time before the
sun has seen fit to rise. With a shrill
screech my clock commands me to rise
and I am pitifully obedient to its order.
The timing is remarkably accurate, the
resonance of quartz crystals allowing
such small error bars when it comes to
time keeping.
If one divides the majesty of the cos-
mos into cycles of twenty four units, I
can honestly say in submitting my will
to the chronometer I am able to wake
at almost exactly the same point in that
cycle after each period of rest. My flesh
begs me to ignore the call, to return to
dreams, but I am a soldier in the army
Viscount Kensington’s tale of urban pain
of time and I am well disciplined. Hu-
manity must be ignored, the machine
knows best.
I walk through grey streets under
a grey sky to board a train crowded
with grey people in grey moods. The
universal detestation of the hour is
palpable. Ambition long ago became a
rotting carcass; the hope that one-day
the alarm might not go off is the last
fragment of a testament to its mere
existence. But this communal outlook
does not bring those that co-habit this
train closer together. No, each one de-
spises the other. When tightly packed,
as if in worship of efficiency of space,
every annoyance is amplified, every
individual reduced to a mere obstacle
and nuisance. There is no curiosity
about others or interest in what won-
derful things they could have filled the
years of their life with. There is only
the firm belief that your world would
be so much the better if they were not
there, forcing you against a wall. And
so a crowd is made alone. Company is
warped into solitude.
Emerging from the dark of the tun-
nels, I find myself once again amongst
maddening crowds, amongst infuriat-
ing racket, amongst bleak concrete.
I go to my prison, where a myriad of
punishments await me. Sometimes I
am to sit in a dark room where I record
in my lab book dark notes about the
darkness. Many times I am sent to sit
among the crowds as an academic,
who I know not, instructs me on how a
universe I have never met ought to be-
have. Once such things stirred my pas-
sion, when the numbers were the tools
of my trade and I was an apprentice
to a master. Now I am a number. Now
there is the taint of industry about
it. Knowledge is mass-produced, we
merely the faceless, interchangeable
products churned out in a great line.
At the end of the process our quality
will be assessed and those not up to
standard will be discarded.
My incarceration comes to a close
long after the day has done the same.
Having never seen the light of the sun,
I sometimes look up for the light of
the stars. But the stars dare not shine.
The light of night is obedient to the
city’s will and the city’s timetables. It
is precisely measured so it might be
precisely charged for. Synthetic yellow
hue conceals the blazing glory of pri-
mordial cosmic furnaces. Magnificent,
but crushing: if they cannot triumph,
there is no hope for me. One wonders
if the city could not obscure heaven or
and the city bids a productive morning
to its recalibrated automata.
“He who makes a beast of himself
gets rid of the pain of being a man,”
said the lexicographer Samuel John-
son. He also said, “A man who can
change a prince’s mind is like a dog
who speaks Norwegian: even rarer!,”
but that is rather irrelevant for the
purposes of this commentary. London
has taken the first statement to heart
and brought it into the modern age.
The city knows that the despotism of
routine, the clockwork destiny, can
bestow us with a hollow purpose and
meaningless directive. As a beast we
abandon thought.
As a machine we focus it into a
monolith, entirely devoted to the task
of the hour. We are capable of do-
ing both; we probably should do both
from time to time. Yet I do not think
we were meant to do one or the other
all of the time. But who am I to ques-
tion the city, to dream of fighting it’s
twisted influence? In this place where
altars most assuredly are nothing but
mere tables draped in tablecloth, there
is no salvation.
Well, until the weekend. Then I get
to turn that bloody clock off. I really
want to go to bed.

W
hat say we go over
to Primrose Hill
this afternoon?”
“All right,” I said,
“but I still want to
walk through Hyde Park.”
“Look, your department is not go-
ing to be open,” my girlfriend insisted.
“Nobody will be able to get in - all of
London is on pause.”
“Be that as it may. I am now in Lon-
don, and in London it is snowing. Hyde
Park is right around the corner and if
it’s the last thing I do I am going for a
walk through a snowbound Hyde Park.”
By this stage I was getting petulant.
“Primrose Hill is just as close,” my
flatmate lied, “and the walk through
Regent’s Park will be just as nice as a
walk through Hyde Park.”
“Nicer,” my girlfriend chimed in.
“Definitely” my flatmate repeated
emphatically, “nicer”. They both gave
me the same Look one gives a small
child who has just kicked his football
through the neighbour’s plate-glass
window – shattering a small porce-
lain figure of an elephant and killing
a canary – and who is well aware that
this time he is not going to get the ball
back.
“Oh, all right.” I grumbled as I skipped
out of the room.
“Why Primrose Hill?” my girlfriend
asked.
“I just got a phone call from my sis-
ter,” he explained, “and apparently peo-
ple are sliding down the hill on plastic
rubbish bags.”
“Cool!” I said, sticking my head
around the door. I disappeared mo-
mentarily. “Do we have any rubbish
bags?”
“Of course!” exploded my flatmate;
on which note he marched into the
kitchen, opened a drawer with great
conviction, closed it with even greater
convictionandlookedaroundinconfu-
sion for an instant before triumphantly
pulling open a door and brandishing a
roll of white bin liners.

“D’you talking to me?”
“Ach, leave it.” Pause.
“Doo talking to me?”
Having trudged up the slope, we
found ourselves in one of the most
unusual cross-sections of London life
I can remember being in. Some 300
people with an average age of 23 stood
stamping on the snow, bedecked in a
dazzling array of colours. A large hat
attached to a small orange coat that
turned out to be my flatmate’s sister
handed us a large cardboard sheet
and pointed us in the direction of the
slope.
Welookedaroundus.Thewatchword
of the day, I feel, was improvisatiion.
Improvised clothing in in unexpected
weather, improvised transportation in
a paralyzed city and improvised sled-
ding equipment once the three sledges
available from Argos had sold out.
“If only Woolworths were still alive!”
was the almost audible cry of pain.
With no official equipment to help
them out, the youths around us had
cobbled together a range of methods
of descent which were a true testament
to British ingenuity.
To our left, three construction work-
ers in fluorescent yellow lifevests were
taking turns on a 3m by 20cm plank
of wood, whose aerodynamism was
receiving envious looks from the cou-
ple struggling to make progress on the
ironing board.
The four teenagers on the air mat-
tress were too delirious to race it down
the hill, and just lay there sleeping on
the summit. Next to them, in the centre
of the throng, an athletic young man in
a camouflage-grey jacket was body-
popping relentlessly to the sound of
an aged boom-box resting on the snow
beside him. People were giving him a
wide berth, but his obliviousness to it
all was exceeded only by the fervour of
his knee-twists.
Of particular interest to us were the
two youngsters on stolen road signs.
A tall, greasy-haired object was hav-
ing great succession with a Deviations
Ahead sign, while his more rotund ac-
complice kept veering hopelessly off
course on his Men At Work placard.
We applauded their initiative, if not
their flagrant disregard for civic regu-
lations and at least two distinct subsec-
tions of the highway code.
After half an hour’s preparation on a
slope of our own construction on the
side, we felt we were up to the chal-
lenge and sidestepped our friend with
the boombox to the main slope. Hav-
ing found a second piece of cardboard
and wrapped it appropriately, we took
turns racing down the hill at respect-
able velocities.
“Look over there,” said my girlfriend
suddenly, pointing at an iced-over
concrete path leading down the slope.
“That looks like fun!” As a grown-up
who gets queasy on the Little Alpine
Train at EuroDisney, it looked any-
thing but fun.
As she raced off down the path, my
flatmate and I edged warily over to the
top of the slope.
“No way am I going down that,” I
declared, digging an enormous Cater-
pillar Boot into the snow to serve as a
crampon.
“Well, see you back up here then”
said my flatmate as he readied himself
for descent.
I turned away haughtily, forgetting
about the hold I had achieved with my
foot. I spun inelegantly in the air for a
moment before landing heavily on a
convenient bin liner by my flatmate’s
side. With a dignfied inevitability, fric-
tion started to abandon me.
“Come on,” said my flatmate, holding
out his hand.
“Come on!” I echoed, grabbing his
outstretched hand in a distinctly non-
homo-erotic manner but rather with
the very manly determination one finds
among parachutists and bungee jump-
ers. And marines. Mainly marines.
Shooting down the slope we found
ourselves engaging in the most amaz-
ing acrobatic feats in an attempt to
send as few toddlers to the casualty
wards of London as possible. After
grabbing the ice with my hands to pull
us round a couple of young girls going
down head-first on a teatray, and let-
ting go of my flatmate so that we could
pass on either side of a man on a snow-
board, I found myself looking straight
into the eyes of a young woman who
was descending with her back to the
slope. The choice had clearly not been
hers.
As she started braking I was just able
to roll to my side and pass her, but
could hear the yell of panic she emitted
as my flatmate proved unable to avoid
the collision.
There was a dull crash, followed by a
joint scream from the two interlocked
bodies skidding down beside me. With
his right foot trapped between her legs
and her neck inextricably stuck under
his left knee, my flatmate and his vic-
tim gathered momentum and quickly
overtook me.
“Lovely day,” I could hear him say.
Silence. Indefatigably optimistic in
his conversational approach, he tried
again.
“Come here often?”
Having finally though gawkily arrived
at the bottom, I staggered to my feet
and waved the carboard in victory.
“Behold the sleigh that has con-
quered the icy slopes of Primrose Hill!”
I would have cried, if the emotion had
not been too much for me.
“Excuse me –” said a young mother
next to me “– do you mind if Michael
uses your sled?”
“Of course not,” I replied gallantly,
smiling at the young boy who took the
opportunity to throw a snowball in my
face.
I handed them the piece of cardboard
as I stepped over a small child careen-
ing maniacally down the hill in a bak-
ing tray. The press gang had been right.
This was better than Hyde Park.
“Aha!” He cried as he ripped one
open and jumped inside. “See?”
I saw. So, too, after a moment, did he.
The mouth of the bin liner flapped pa-
thetically around his calves.
“I’m not sliding down a hill on that,”
said a feminine voice from behind me.
“I’ll go out and get some more,” I
said, retreating into my room to get
dressed. Some time later, puffed up
like a tanned Michelin Man in a vest, a
turtleneck top, a sweater, a cardigan, a
7-foot Imperial scarf and a long brown
trenchcoat, I opened the door to the
flat and stood in the doorway.
“I am just going outside;” I said, fal-
teringly. “I may be some time.” The
door crashed in my face.
...
“Is that Primrose Hill?”
“Yup. From the top of there you
get the best view of the city. 70% of
all films shot in London have a scene
from up there. Three Weddings and a
Funeral...”
“And its more famous sequel,” I whis-
pered under my breath,
“... Doctor Who, Notting Hill - the
list is endless.”
“So the one day we’re going up there
is the one day we don’t get to see the
view?” I shook my head in disgust.
“Typical.”
I looked ahead at the mound which
was beginning to take shape through
the falling snow. On top of all that
white I could see a giant black huddle –
hundreds of small outlines fighting for
space and crowding for warmth.
“Are you sure we haven’t gone too
far North?” I asked: “We seem to be
interfering with the Emperor penguin
migration.”
“Very funny,” they lied again, as we
slowly made our way to the top.
“You talking to me?” I asked my flat-
mate in what I thought was my best
Happy Feet manner.
“No no - ‘Jew talkin’ to me?!’ - get it
right! Robin Williams was putting on a
blind the eyes of God. Perhaps all sins
go unseen here.
And what of the night? The morn-
ing’s journey is repeated, with faces
weary from the deeds of today and
with the thought of tomorrow. Broth-
els light their windows and their less
explicit cousins, the clubs, open their
doors. Clubs, where people go to be
amongst maddening crowds, infuriat-
ing racket and bleak concrete: the dif-
ference between a place of leisure and
public transport lies in the alcohol. In
that poison we find our joy, as every
generation before us has done. We
dull our minds for when thought is less
robust it is less piercing. We stifle our
sensations so our torture might be felt
all the less acutely. We find the peace
of intoxication as the toxin kills our
reason.
And if, perchance, we should catch
a passing glance of some Aphrodite or
Hercules, then let instinct have its lib-
erty. We free ourselves from the shack-
les of mechanical logic and for a night
we are not machines. We are beasts.
We pass between the extremes, never
stopping at humanity. With the caged
emotion having been permitted to
stretch its wings, we wake up the next
day to the shrill screech of the clock
“‘I am in London.
It is snowing. I
am going to walk
through Hyde
Park.’ I was getting
petulant.”
