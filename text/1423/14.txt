Top music, but is it a rotten Egg?
Jessica Bland checks out MUAK (People together) @ Egg, with
New York house legend Osunlade topping the bill
S
tanding in the 5th arena of
the Egg nightclub at half
three on Saturday night, I got
chatting to a guy. Unlike the
predatory males who popu-
lated the two main dance floors, this
one just wanted to share my place in
front of the air conditioning. He put
his hands up to the cold air and sighed,
“Ah, oh dear, the poor rotten Egg.” Re-
ally? I thought, I can’t smell anything.
Then the penny dropped: “What,
so you don’t think much of this place
then?”
“No,” he says, “its falling apart, and
the crowd are just not cool.”
Looking around at the slightly droopy
tent-style ceiling and the sad looking dj
playing to the twelve people sitting on
dirty white leather stools, and thinking
back to the testosterone fuelled dance
floor, he definitely has a point.
Clubbing is much more fun when
there are nice toilets and clean floorss
and when I can dance by myself and
not be bothered by anyone around
me. But, unlike my new friend, I care
more about the music than the people
and that night the music can only be
described as bangin’.
Muak did a great thing in getting
New York house legend Osunlade to
play in London. This man knows how
to get people really dancing: no drops,
no jump up beats, just damn good
music.
By keeping the funk in house music,
whilst avoiding the dismal genre of
funky house, Osunlade is unlike any
European Dj I can think of.
I
t was another murky Janu-
ary afternoon; my coffee was
warm and my attention span
short. I took to the internet.
Left brain/right brain function-
ing, transcendental meditation, bohe-
mian counterculture - my absent mind
was dragged along through a chain of
vaguely related themes as I clicked on-
wards. Eventually I arrived at http://
www.one-tribe.info/, a multicoloured
pastiche of swirling colours, hippie
ideals and amusing animated butter-
flies. On inspection it turned out that
the site was a hub for a multitude of
London based parties and gatherings,
where like-minded people could share
friendship and a collective concern
for the ‘delicate planet and everything
within it’. This all appeared sincere and
well-intentioned, so with a spirit of in-
quisitiveness and mild adventure I de-
cided to go to the next party.
It was 11pm on Saturday night and

Snow Bar!
I
guess I should start with some
bad innuendo about white pow-
der, as this is the nightlife sec-
tion. Hahaha. Oh yes, of course
I am talking in a sarcastic man-
ner about snow blizzards, not cocaine.
Hahaha. We’re not all rampant drug
takers here at the felix offices (I myself
have checked into rehab). I love snow,
but it certainly is not conjunctive with
having an awesome night on the town.
When the temperature drops below
zero and the transport infrastructure is
down, clubbing is off the menu.
As ever, you should make the most of
the situation, Imperial students! Why
not drink cocktails in the snow?! If you
can’t physically make it to a bar, make
your own bar? It is the credit crunch
after all...
So why not build your bar from
scratch, placing blocks of snowman on
top of each other like lego bricks. You
could get carried away and create an
igloo drinking lodge!
Or, more realistically, you could sim-
ply find a preprepared, snow-covered
wall to perch against. And this has it’s
benefits. It’s a safe and easy place to
put your drink. Plus, you might require
something sturdy to hold onto later.
I find the ice underfoot strangely be-
comes a bit slippier than expected after
a few drinks.
Finally, don’t forget the fabulous
snow-themed drinks! I garnished my
mohito with a sprinkling of snow. I call
this new cocktail a sno-hito! Wow! And
don’t forget; that snow drift is nothing
more than nature’s beer cooler!
Okay I’m just messing here. Drinking
out in the cold is not big or clever, or
at all classy. It’s one step above drink-
ing cider on a park bench. Be careful
with alcohol and snow. Think about
the long term consequences of drink-
ing alcohol (and eating snow) for your
health and well being.

I was stood alone inside Tufnell park
tube station, just north of Camden.
The rain was heavy and unrelenting. I
paused briefly weighing up my doubts,
before running out headlong into the
weather. As I carried along the road,
pounding trance beats gradually start-
ed to dominate the urban soundscape
and I felt a warm rush of excitement.
Then I was inside, walking along
the hallway and waving goodbye to
£10, but as I entered the main room
my heart sank. The place was practi-
cally empty and wandering around I
became increasingly self-conscious of
my solo status. Defaulting to the bar, I
grabbed a very reasonably priced pint
of lager and found a discrete wooden
post to lean against and take stock.
There were two rooms of medium to
large size, both like dishevelled school
assembly halls. Thankfully the décor,
which consisted mainly of luminously
coloured fabric triangles, served well to
cheer the place up. However, the light-
ing rigs and sound systems were fairly
unspectacular, paling in comparison to
those of more commercial venues. The
DJs were playing psy-trance, progres-
sively merged with flavours of house,
breaks and other strains of electronica.
The music was constantly evolving in
terms of its rhythmic/harmonic struc-
ture and so succeeded in holding my
attention.
As my first pint shallowed, the place
was beginning to fill up and there was
a lively vibe developing. Walking out-
side into the covered smoking area,
I was soon at ease, sensing that the
crowd were generally part of an eclec-
tic community of intelligent, interest-
ing and mostly warm-hearted people.
The average age was probably in the
late twenties and I soon found that
dreadlocks, face-paint and flowery
skirts were all common adornments.
The first person I talked to turned to
be one of the DJs (Pieman) and before
I knew it, I was being invited to bring
my saxophone along and play at the
next event!
Then I took to the dancefloor. The
smooth flowing bass-lines and hyp-
notically iterative melodies seemed to
weave connectively through each oth-
er. Squelchy saw-waves and ethereal
twinkles created a rich texture, expan-
sive and unmistakeable. Dance styles
consisted of flowing circular move-
ments and allowed for much interac-
tion between individuals. There was a
shared space and a shared purpose. I
no longer felt alone.
The night was high-spirited and
celebratory in nature. My sense of
time began to break down as I gradu-
ally became absorbed into the environ-
ment. Several hours passed. Periods
burning energy were punctuated by
breaks outside where people shared
freely their stories, thoughts and opin-
ions. As conversations began to follow
certain themes; trips to Goa, the his-
tory of trance, communal living and
modern revolution, I began to realise
that I’d tapped into the vein of a whole
subculture.
Then the trance was broken. The
music stopped and the lights came on.
The night was over and the artifice of
purpose gradually dissolved. I left the
club exhausted and refreshed as the
daylight revealed pale faces and tired
eyes. In the relative silence people
slowly dissipated, heading their own
separate ways. As I stood on the pave-
ment, alone again, I recalled the name
of the web site that had brought me
there, ‘One Tribe’. For a short time I
had been a part of it and maybe I would
be again.

To add to this treat, we had Matthew
Bandy on before him. Even without his
partnerfromDeepHouseSoldiers(Joel
Jackson), his mixing skills kept my at-
tention long enough that I didn’t even
think about getting a drink until I had
been in the club two hours already.
The only thing that was upsetting
was that they were on in the smaller
Basement rather than the Terrace
room. So most people didn’t even real-
ise they were playing. Indeed, this was
what baffled me most about the night
– the difference between the music and
the crowd. The crowd were unreactive
(except in their leering) and the music
soulful and imaginative, which all in all
made for a bit of a bizarre evening.
The rotten egg man summed it up
for me when he asked, “so who is play-
ing tonight anyway?”
“This guy who is kind of a big deal in
NY. Why are you here then if you don’t
like the place and don’t know who is
playing?”
“Well The End is shut now, as is Bar
Rhumba et al and I am not 18 or for
into minimalist, so I won’t go to Fab-
ric and I am not yet 30, so I won’t go
to Koko’s. But I couldn’t sleep; so I
thought a bit of rotten Egg was better
than drinking by myself.”
O
n one of the coldest days
of the year, there is only
one place to go. Absolut
Ice Bar; the coolest bar,
in temperature at least,
in the whole of London town.
Absolut Ice Bar is a stylish, minimal-
ist paradise. Everything is made of pure
transparant ice, from the ice sculptures
to ice cube glass containing my Abso-
lut vodka cocktail. The beautiful crys-
tal clear ice is sourced from the pure
springs of the Torne River in Lapland.
Upon arrival, a doorman draped us
in fabulous cloaks to keep us warm.
These shiny blue ponchos with a furry
hood had a “seventies disco elf” vibe
going on, and certainly added fun to
proceedings.
To keep the ice in tip-top condition,
the bar is kept at a chilly minus five
degrees celsius. “Is this eco-friendly?”
my companion asked. I don’t know, but
there is certainly no other bar like it.
Our Absolut vodka cocktail in hand,
we sat back in the fur lined ice seats,
enjoying the futuristic blue lighting
and smooth ice sculptures. My per-
sonal favourite was the ice cube chair,
a ‘60s sci-fi “egg” chair. The combina-
tion of intriguing ice sculptures and
sleek industrial silver floor made my
slightly drunk companion chuckle,
“Doesn’t it remind you a bit of the
Crystal Maze?”. “No, it’s like a perfume
ad in my opinion”.
After 40 minutes chilling out, it was
our time to leave. We swept through
the fur drapes out into the reality of
the cold London streets. “It’s like leav-
ing Narnia” my accomplice said, and he
was quite right. It was a captivating ice
world, something out of the ordinary.
Overall, it was an enjoyable experi-
ence, something to save for a special
occasion. I think Absolut Ice Bar would
be ideal for a quick pre-theatre drink,
as the small icy capacity means time is
limited to a disappointing 40 minutes
per group.
I am excited to note Absolut Ice Bar
will undergo an interior ice redesign
in April; “Acclaimed jewellers David
& Martin, former designers for Karl
Lagerfeld, will be transforming the
ABSOLUT ICEBAR into a glittering
treasure trove of gemstones”.
