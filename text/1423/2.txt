College bring in
strategy to weather
financial storm
The current economic recession has
forced the College to take actions in or-
der to overcome the “violate economic
times in the UK and globally”. The rec-
tor, Sir Roy Anderson, said in an email
earlier this week to all members of staff
that “Whilst Imperial College’s imme-
diate outlook for this year and the next
is one of good health, it is incumbent
on us to adopt a responsible and pre-
cautionary approach”.
As an initial step, all faculties, de-
partments, divisions and nonacademic
functions have been told to assume
a 5% decrease in next years budget
compared to this year. As a more im-
mediate effect, the College has decided
to stop hiring external nonacademic
staff, however, the rector did say that
the College will continue to “support
academic recruitment where opportu-
nities arise for us to bring outstanding
individuals to the College and to sus-
tain our excellence”.
The overall aim of the cuts are to
create a surplus in the budget so that
the College could handle the expected
“squeeze in UK public funding”. In the
email, the rector went on to say that
this will hopefully “strengthen the Col-
lege so we can take advantage of the
economic recovery when it comes”.
As a closing statement, Sir Roy An-
derson stated that “Imperial College
is certainly in a position to help the
UK economy - we translate research
discoveries into innovations and form
spin out companies; we contribute to
solving global problems, and we con-
tinue to attract to the UK the highest
quality students from wherever they
may be found in the world.”
He went on to say “Our mission
and objectives remain the same and I
hope all will understand that by taking
these prudent measures at this time we
are collectively helping to protect the
College from further, and potentially
greater, perturbations.”

Imperial College Union [ICU] Clubs
& Societies and Imperial College Ca-
reers Advisory Service have come to a
disagreement over room bookings and
external companies.
According to their web site, the
Imperial Careers Advisory Service
‘provides a varied and comprehen-
sive careers guidance, information
and vacancy service for all students
and alumni of Imperial College, from
first to final year undergraduates and
postgraduates.’ One of the methods by
which they accomplish this is by or-
ganising career talks by a wide range of
companies.
In a similar fashion, several of the
ICU Clubs & Societies offer the op-
portunity for students to interact with
like minded people, as well as potential
employers. These societies, such as the
Finance Society and the Consultancy
Society who have both been described
as “Career Clubs”, have the luxury of
free room booking around the College
which they use to organise events with
various firms. In contrast, the Careers
Advisory Service would charge the
various companies for room bookings.
The fact that Clubs & Societies were
booking rooms for talks by external
companies only became apparent after
the Finance Society told the company
to organise catering themselves, after
which they called the Conference de-
partment at Imperial who informed the
Careers Advisory Service. As a result,
the booking of College space for talks
by graduate recruiters is now under
review, with Deputy President (Clubs
& Societies) Lily Topham planning to
attend a meeting with the relevant Col-
lege departments next week. A possi-
ble outcome of the meeting could be a
banning of graduate recruitment talks.
The outcome of that meeting could
have severe implications to the funding
provided to many Clubs and Societies
at Imperial. Although societies such
as Finance and Consultancy use the
money given by the various companies
to solely arrange ‘career’ events, others
rely on the money for the day to day
running of the club. This is particularly
evident in the clubs that are part of the
Athletic Clubs Committee [ACC] who
need the money to simply function.
Every club or society at Imperial is
entitled to funding from the Union, to
cover the expenses, however for many
of these clubs or societies, the funding
provided is not enough and as such
look for funding from external sources.
From the graduate recruiters point of
view, being able to target students on
many small scales seems advantageous
as they can target specific groups, as
well as saving money on hiring costs.
From the individual club or societies
point of view, they receive sponsorship
which they can then use to stay afloat.
The implications of banning the
talks could prove costly to many clubs
and societies who desperately rely
on the money provided by graduate
recruiters.
Imperial to set up overseas
campus in near future
Kadhim Shubber
Deputy Editor
In an interview with the Financial
Times, Rector Sir Roy Anderson gave
the strongest signal yet that Impe-
rial is planning to set up an overseas
campus.
Sites being considered for a possible
overseas campus include China, India,
Singapore or an Arab Emirate, specifi-
cally Qatar or Abu Dhabi.
Sir Roy told the Financial Times
“The question in mind is whether we
should have a formal campus overseas”
and that such a move would “not [be]
worth doing unless we do it in hun-
dreds [of students].”
He rejected concerns that an over-
seas endeavour might reduce the qual-
ity of its flagship South Kensington
campus, saying that Imperial would
not be considering an expansion if
such a risk existed. Sir Roy said that he
was confident the high-quality of Im-
perial’s applicants would prevent this
from happening.
Financial concerns have also mo-
tivated the plans for a new overseas
campus; it is hoped that a surplus
would me made from such a campus
that could be re-invested in Imperial’s
London base.
Sir Roy also indicated that Imperial
may increase the proportion of fee-
paying non-EU students to increase
revenue if government funding was
reduced due to the recession.
The Rector had previously alluded
to plans for an overseas campus in his
speech at Commemoration Day last
October.
He was much more cautious in his
speech than in his FT interview, speak-
ing of “the possibility of establishing
Imperial ‘footprints’ overseas.”
He left the door open for smaller
overseas ventures such as “collabo-
rative research facilities or Faculties
for undergraduate and postgradu-
ate training in partnership with local
Union ‘security’ has taken hits from
all flanks this last fortnight. Last week
saw the Union Server’s database secu-
rity infiltrated, but now it is the actual
physical presence of Beit Quad’s secu-
rity that is in question.
Computers in the Union Office have
been stolen during the afternoon of
Sunday the 1st of February. At 5pm the
Union Office, based on the 1st floor
of the Union Building, were found to
be subject to forced entry. It is uncon-
firmed if the main entrance was left
unlocked or forced open at this stage.
Deputy President (Clubs & Socie-
ties) Lily Topham was said to have left
at 2.55pm, and was confident that she
had locked up both her internal of-
fice door and the main entrance door.
Upon returning at around 5pm, both
her own and Deputy General Manager,
Robin Pitt’s internal office doors were
found to have been forcibly opened,
and an iMac from each office taken.
Computers stolen
from Union offices
The internal doors to Union Presi-
dent and Deputy President (Finances
& Services) offices show evidence of
attempted forced entry, but after in-
spection, the main entrance doors
showed no signs of damage. This leaves
the issue of whether the door was left
unlocked within the time period Ms.
Topham was absent. An unnamed
Union Entertainment staff member
was said to have opened up the offices
within this time period.
The two iMacs taken contained little
valuable data themselves, as all impor-
tant documentation is stored on the
Union Servers, rather than directly on
the iMac hard drives. Though CCTV
footage is still to be studied, the thieves
are reckoned to have escaped via the
back entrance of the Union onto Ken-
sington Gore.
Imperial College Union President
Jenny Morgan stated that the Union
was now under “an immediate security
review” and that Office members were
“disappointed, but feel lucky it was not
a bigger loss.”

The students at any overseas campus
would initially be those on Masters
degree programmes in a range of sub-
jects, including medicine. Undergrad-
uates might also be admitted in the
long-term as the campus developed.
The Rector made it clear that an over-
seas campus “isn’t a five-year project,
it’s a 50-year project”.

It’s time for RAG ‘09 at Imperial College
Union, get your wallets out
Imperial College Union RAG week is
less than two weeks away, this year’s
RAG chair, Jon Downing, can be iden-
tified as the person twitching nervously
at the mention of fundraising permits,
bar-nights and collecting tins.
Contrary to popular belief, RAG does
not stand for Randy Angry Geek, but
for Raising And Giving. RAG is one
week of the year where anything goes
from throwing pies at the rector and
building human pyramids in Trafalgar
Square to making the Union President
audition for X-Factor in spandex.
This year, RAG week is raising mon-
ey for Banardos, Shelter and the Rain-
bow Trust (see next week’s felix for in-
formation on the charities).
Imperial College Unions’s RAG has a
depressing history of being overshad-
owed by the medic’s RAG. Determined
to prove that the rest of Imperial are
just as charitable the medical school,
Union President, Jenny Morgan and
the rest of Imperial College Union have
pledged to support this years RAG,
even bringing in a laser quest to the
Union Quad on the Wednesday night!
Having already raised almost £2500
RAG, over 100 people signed up for
RAG week at freshers fair (though it’s
possible this was just on the promise
of a free t-shirt), if each of you who
signed up raised £10 that would be an-
other £1000! Better still, (according to
Jov) 8000 of you are reading this paper
(well not THIS paper, but a copy of this
paper), if each of you gave up an hour
or two of your lives to shake a tin at a
tube station, do silly challenges during
RAG RAID or just have a few goes on
the laser quest and raise £10 each, that
would be £80,000! Ok, so perhaps I’m
getting ahead of myself...
Besides being fun, taking part in
events during RAG week takes the guilt
out of avoiding the gaze of a homeless
person or of leaving half a plate of nice
food with your mothers voice saying
‘there are children starving in the third
world you know!’ ringing in your ear.
There is something for everyone to
take part in, including challenges to
complete around London in the RAG
RAID, a pub crawl with the IC Rugby
Club to collect in pubs around South
Ken. Or you could buy yourself a slave
in the CGCU slave auction, attend the
RCSU club night in the award winning
Maya in Soho, or simply take a lunch-
time tour of the Queens Tower.
