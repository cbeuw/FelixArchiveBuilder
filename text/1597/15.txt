Next Gen Console: Your Table + Friends
Sanchit Sharma on why you should jump on-board for XCOM
"This is a
board game
all about
making
difficult
decisions
very
quickly."
"I’m going
to struggle
to find a
reason to
play any
other in
the near
future.”
XCOM: The Board Game is
a fast-paced, fairly light,
co-operative board game
about defending Earth from an alien
threat. For those of you that don’t
know board games, co-operative
board games are those where the
players work together, against the
game – fitting, considering the
theme! The thing that really sets it
apart from every other board game
on the market today is that it is
played with an app (which only one
player needs to have), which controls
the enemy AI and several other
mundane tasks such as tracking
income and teaching people how to
play the game.
Each of the four players takes on
a role: Commander, Central Officer,
Squad Leader or Chief Scientist – if
there are fewer than four one or
more people will have to double
up on roles. A game turn is split up
into two phases, the timed and the
resolution phase. During the timed
phase, the accompanying app will
tell the Central Officer what is going
on in the world and the other players
must react, often forcing them to
make difficult decisions in very
short periods of time. During the
resolution phase, the players will see
the effects of their decisions – a lot
of the game happens here, but you
can’t recover from a bad timed phase
with a good resolution phase.
The game is very easy to pick up
and understand, and it captures
the feel of the XCOM video games
perfectly. The simple rules make the
decisions easy to understand, but the
choices themselves are often very
difficult. The designers hit the nail
on the head with this, it not only
represents the video games very well
but it also translates into a really
interesting gaming experience on
the tabletop. For example, one of
the events is a crisis – this means
that the Commander must draw the
top two crisis cards and choose one
to happen. There is nearly never a
good decision here, and inevitably
the chosen crisis will make a big
impact on at least one player, which
is exactly how a decision in a game of
XCOM should be.
The timed phase is great – you
can pause for short periods of time
if you need to, not completing alien
tasks quickly enough will cost you
time on your own tasks, and the AI is
actually quite strong. However, the
resolution phase uses a push your
luck mechanic that, whilst it does
mimic the feel of the game, feels
out of place in a co-operative game.
It’s quite possible to do everything
right in the timed phase and then
lose the game due to bad luck in
the resolution phase, although the
reverse is, thankfully, much less
likely. Overall though, the tech
and combat mechanics are well
designed and the game proceeds very
smoothly.
The component quality is high
(though, sadly, the miniatures
are unpainted and as such it can
be difficult to tell which soldiers
are which), with thick tokens and
well-made cards. There are three
different sizes of cards, which is
understandable as they each need to
fit different roles, but would be very
annoying if you wanted to sleeve
them. However, the game also has a
pretty bad insert and doesn’t really
come with enough bags for all the
parts.
Now, for those of you that have
played co-operative board games
before, you may have heard a few
complaints about them. The most
common are the alpha player
syndrome (where one person tells
everyone else what to do), and the
idea that the game often plays you,
instead of the other way around
(i.e. there is always an obvious
decision to make). XCOM deals with
both of these problems very well.
An alpha player cannot emerge in
the timed phase as there simply
isn’t the time to show other people
what information each player has,
though in the resolution phase the
opportunity is still there. As for the
second problem, XCOM has always
been a game of hard decisions.
Sometimes a decision is obvious,
but this is quite rare. This is a board
game all about making difficult
decisions very quickly, so this issue
doesn’t really manifest like it does in
other co-operative board games.
It should be noted, however, that
this is a much easier game than most
other co-operative board games.
Having played it three times, once
solo and twice with four players, I
managed to beat both the easy and
medium difficulty levels. Compare
this to Ghost Stories, where in the
first five or six times playing the
game on easy we all died horribly.
Finally, the big question is the app.
It’s never been done in a board game
before, so does it work? My response
is a very confident yes – not only
does it reduce the complexity of
the game significantly, but it has
images and music in the background
that add to the feel and tension of
the game. They put a bit too much
faith into the app in my opinion, as
it really would have been helpful to
include an actual rulebook in the
game and a few notes on how certain
things are calculated. However, the
decision to require this app was a
sensible one. It’s made the game
significantly better.
Overall XCOM: TBG is a very well
designed and produced game. It fits
the look and feel of the video games
very well, and constantly leaves the
players on the edge of their seats.
It has issues, but it’s such a big leap
forward in co-operative board games
that I’m going to struggle to find a
reason to play any other in the near
future.
If you’re interested in trying
this game out, come meet up with
Tabletop Gaming Society! We do
everything tabletop, from Magic
the Gathering, to board games, to
roleplaying games. We meet for
board games every Monday at 18:00
in Huxley 711c. You can also email
any of the committee for details.
Come say hello!
