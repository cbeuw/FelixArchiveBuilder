THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 45
FELIX 13.02.2015
Sport Editor: Kunal Wagle
Imperial host Hyde Park Relays
On Saturday 7th
February,
more than 600 runners from
universities across the UK, the
Netherlands and Poland took part
in the Hyde Park Relays, hosted by
Imperial College Cross Country and
Athletics Club. Teams comprised of 6
men or 4 women, each running a lap
of the 5 km course, beginning by the
Serpentine and looping clockwise up
to Marble Arch before returning to
the bandstand.
The likes of Cambridge, Oxford,
Portsmouth, Manchester and many
of the London Colleges sent teams to
compete, and were joined by over 150
students of Imperial College taking
on the challenge themselves.
At 12 noon, Club Captain Matt
Douthwaite started the race with a
welcome and a blast of the whistle,
and the leg one runners took off down
the opening straight led by some
pretty big names in the running world
and some more excitable internal
runners.
Chris Bannon, one of the main
organisers of the event, was first
up for the Imperial Men’s A Team,
hoping to defend his 2 year title of
fastest leg at the event, but faced stiff
competition from Cambridge runners
who’d lined up some of their best.
Also on the start line was Imo
Simmonds running for the Imperial
Women’s A Team, backed up by the
full scoring team who placed 8th in
BUCS XC seven days earlier, so hopes
were high for a medal.
Once underway, the race moved
fast. Bannon and Short jostled for
1st place at the front. The hundreds
of other runners sailed past – not
only IC Cross Country and Athletics,
but also Imperial students with
all manner of points to prove and
a hilarious range of fancy dress
costumes. Spotted outfits included
superheroes, gentleman dressed in
a bra and hot pants and Braveheart-
style tartan robes.
Unfortunately Cambridge were
first at the end of leg one, 12 seconds
ahead of Bannon, who ran 14:33! He
handed the bat over to Chris Olley
to charge down the Cambridge team.
He ran a time of 14:47, extremely
impressive. Over in the Women’s
race, Imo had handed over to Sarah
Johnson, who went on to run one of
the legs of the day with 17:16. The
mass of teams around the bandstand
created a fantastic atmosphere and
some spectators ventured out onto
the course to provide support for
their runners.
The Imperial Men’s A’s were still
holding on tight with pressure from
Sheffield and Oxford too. A third
Chris (Thomas) put in a strong run
to keep them in the game following
David Freeman, handing on to Simon
Prigent and finally James Ellis. The
Women’s A’s were also battling away
and with great runs from freshers
Alex Mundell and Kara Meunier with
18:03 and 20:00 respectively.
The Men’s B Team boys had
impressive performances from Tom
Bartissol and Dom Marshall, both
pushing 17 minutes. Notable runs in
the Men’s Chuckles and Dangerzone
Teams were Marcus Ingram and Alex
Diaz, both with fastest legs for their
Imperial Devils face crunch
clashes this weekend
Imperial Devils B head into a
two-game road trip this weekend
on a dry stretch of late,having
lost their last three games since
a strong season opener,which
saw the team shutout Cardiff
Breadhawks for a 6-0 win on home
ice at the Streatham Ice Arena
(SIA).
First up on Saturday 14th
is a
Valentine’s date at Coventry &
Warwick Panthers B,a team the
Devils B last met on 29th
November
for a tight 2-3 loss,with all goals
against the Devils scored in the
first period.A weak first period
is a pattern that’s plagued the
Devils throughout the season,with
average goals against standing at
3-0.5-1 by period.
Kelly is expected to get the start
in net–his first of the season–with
usual goaltender #17 Zimmerman
unavailable,but due to return for
Sunday’s game.
Devils A also play on Saturday
against Southampton Spitfires B
at home for their first meet this
season after a postponed game
before the holiday break.The A
team are 2-3-0 on their season,
and the Spitfires 1-0-2,giving
them an even point match-up,
but the Spitfires have the edge
in the tables with fewer games
played and +1 (Devils at par) goal
difference.The Devils’power play
conversion comes in at 38.5%,
second only to UCL,with 40%.This
makes for an interesting matchup
with Spitfires’Division-topping
penalty kill at 88.9%,though they
lack on the power play,with no
goals so far this season.
Sunday sees the Devils B head
back out to Oxford,for game 2/2
against the Women’s Blues (the
league is mixed as a whole,though
Oxford and Cambridge each field
separate teams).The teams last
met just two weekends prior,when
the Blues stole a 3-8 win at the
SIA; the Devils again performed
strongest in the second,with
boxscore against 4-1-3.
Six of the Blues’eight goals were
scored by #27 Jennifer Lawrence,
who’s had an incredible season
registering 4.7 Pts/Game.Shots
on goal (SOG) during their last
meet were 53-29 in favour of the
Devils,but the Blues’netminder
did a stellar job of keeping them
out,and went on for a.943 save
percentage; the Blues’(and
Lawrence’s in particular) precision
meant 29 was enough.The Devils
will look for a stronger start in the
first period,and to turn more of
those SOGs into goals.
As always,this weekend’s games
will be blacked out on all local
networks; so be sure to get yourself
down to the Streatham Ice Arena
on Saturday for a 9PM faceoff of
Devils vs Spitfires!

teams. In the Women’s, the ICXC
Gazelles were led home by Marta
Sawicka in 20:18.
After all the excitement of the
relays were over, the teams headed for
the Jacket Potatoes and prize giving.
The competition in the end turned
out too strong for the Men’s A Team,
who placed 4th by just 12 seconds,
beaten out by Cambridge, Oxford
and Sheffield, despite Bannon’s
effort awarding him second fastest
leg of the day. The girls had fared
better, placing 3rd overall, behind
Cambridge and Oxford once again,
thanks to the storming run from
Johnson, awarding her 3rd fastest
woman. In other categories, the
Polish University of Poznan beat the
Dutch to fastest foreign team and
Fisher Hall won the Halls prize.
Afterwards came the after party
in the union. The Hyde Park Relays
Horn made an appearance, sounding
off the celebratory drinks for the
organisers, Chris Bannon and Will
Jones. A massive thank you to them
for working incredibly hard to bring
one of the smoothest HPRs in recent
memory, as well as all the volunteers
who helped out on the day.
Notable moments of the night
included the arrival of Portsmouth,
with their freshers attached to
melons to drink out of, some friendly
drinking rivalry with Cambridge,
some possible over celebration from a
certain organiser and of course Taylor
Swift.
