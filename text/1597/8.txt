Christopher Kaye, Deputy
President (Welfare), achieved
victory in Union Council this
week when his paper on reducing the
cost of female sanitary products was
passed by those present.
The paper outlined his plans
to reduce the cost of the sanitary
products available in the Union Shop
Extra on the Sherfield Walkway,
which currently are sold at a price
that includes a profit margin between
30% and 40%.
Kaye started looking into the issue
a few months prior to the Council
meeting, after receiving an email
from a student concerning the
availably of sanitary produce on
campus. Said Kaye, “it was an issue I
became very motivated about fixing.”
“A big part of my manifesto was
about engaging women in science so
it just seemed right to me that basic
essentials for women should be sold
at the lowest cost possible.”
Kaye spoke to the Union
Management Team who dictate the
prices in the shop, and determined
the financial implications reducing
the profit margin may have. The
management team was amenable to
the idea, so long as the student body
also supported it, so Kaye took the
paper to Union Council, which met
last Tuesday.
Council passed the paper, although
not without debate. One member
complained that if these ‘essentials’
are to be sold without a profit margin,
others, “such as water”, should be sold
without a margin too. Kaye told the
member that he should then just get
it out the tap.
From March, the products will be
approximately a third cheaper.
Felix spoke to Kaye, who told us
“the battle continues - I want there to
be more vending machines available
24 hours a day for students and staff
alike.”
On Wednesday, the leaders of
Russia, Ukraine, France and
Germany met in Belarus’s
capital to discuss bringing peace to
Ukraine after months of violence
between Ukrainians and pro-Russian
separatists. The agreed ceasefire
will come into full effect on Sunday
at midnight and will also involve
withdrawing heavy weaponry from
the frontlines of the conflict.
After the lengthy talks, Russian
president Vladimir was the first
leader to announce the ceasefire,
adding “There is also a political
statement. The first thing is
constitutional reform that should
take into consideration the legitimate
rights of people who live in Donbass.
There are also border issues. Finally
there are a whole range of economic
and humanitarian issues.”
Although German chancellor
Angela Merkel said that the deal
gave “a glimmer of hope”, she
acknowledged that all the leaders
realise that “there is very, very
much work still to do.” Angela
Merkel and the French president
Francois Hollande have also asked
the European Union to support the
ceasefire.
The specifics of the agreement
will involve the withdrawal of heavy
weapons in a two week period,
beginning on the 17th
of February.
Provisions will also be made to
provide amnesty for prisoners
involved with the conflict, and all
foreign militia will also be removed
from Ukrainian territory. Key to the
ceasefire deal is the agreement that
all separatist forces will be withdrawn
from the September ceasefire line.
Residents of Donestsk, a town
that has suffered a great number
of casualties as a result of shelling,
have been cautious to greet the
news with complete optimism. On
Thursday, some rallied outside the
rebel government’s headquarters,
declaring ‘today is a holiday.’
However, some rebels expressed
their disappointment with the new
agreement. ‘Sputnik I Progrom’, a
nationalistic Russian publication,
even labelled the agreement as a
“betrayal of all that th rebels fought
for”.
The discussions in Minsk appeared
to be a difficult, tense and drawn out
affair. During the discussions, Putin’s
apparent frustration at the lack of
progress even led him to snap a pencil.
The discussions come after
many casualties in the region, with
estimates placing the number of
deaths at a figure of over 5,300 people
since April 2014. The battle between
the Ukrainian forces and the pro-
Russian separatists has escalated in
recent weeks, with bloodshed rising
rapidly.
Perhaps one of the biggest points
of contention in the ceasefire is how
Kiev will be able to achieve control of
their borders once again, given that
Russian volunteers and troops have
allegedly crossed it to provide the
rebel’s with aid.
The border has been difficult to
secure, and at present, many of the
border crossings are controlled by
rebels. The ceasefire agreement,

however, states that Kiev will only
restore full control of the border by
the end of this year.
US President Barack Obama has
been put under pressure to provide
military aid to Ukraine’s forces, but
a number of European believers
feel that this would complicate the
conflict and make matters worse.
Meanwhile, Russia’s economy is in
freefall, following economic sanctions
enacted by the West, despite the fact
that Russian government officials
continue to deny aiding separatists.
The long talks in Minsk highlighted
the urgency in resolving the conflict.
The talks followed a visit from
Merkel and Hollande to Kiev and
Moscow last week, in an attempt to
resolve the conflict.
