Kamil McClelland sat down with the
new head of Exploration Board after
their endorsement of his upcoming trip
through Central Asia
The College board that is
letting students cross borders
How many people knew there
was such a thing as the
Imperial Exploration Board?
Apparently not that many, as I found
out when telling people that I had
received their endorsement for a
cycling expedition myself and a few
friends are planning this summer
across Central Asia. And so, I decided
to talk to the Chairman of the Board,
Dr. Lorraine Craig, to find out more
about what the Board does and how
others can get involved.
Kamil McClelland: So Lorraine,
could you tell me a bit about the
history of the Board and why it
formed.
Lorraine Craig: The Board was
established in 1955 under the
sponsorship of the College, the
Students’ Union and Old Students’
Associations to consider proposals for
expeditions submitted by members of
the College and to administer funds
given to assist with the cost of those
expeditions.
It was founded to encourage student
development outside of the lecture
theatre. During the ‘30s and war
years, there were a lot of expeditions
out of Oxford and Cambridge and
starting from around 1953, the
University of London decided to
get in on the game, leading to the
Imperial Board being founded.
The 1957 Karakorum Expedition
was in fact led by legendary British
mountaineer Eric Shipton, where
they surveyed some glaciers in the
Karakorum alongside climbing,
although the final report was never
submitted.
There are also some great photos
in the archive of an expedition to
Iceland in 1956 where at the start of
the trip, they look like best friends but
by the end are all looking in different
directions and seem considerably less
chummy.
KM: Do all expeditions have to
have a science or research aspect to
them?
LC: This certainly was the case in the
early years, where groups went off
to make a map or survey the geology
or botany of the area. But I feel this
has evolved over the years and I
would rather not send out groups
to do ‘simple science’ where it is not
particularly of any research value.
Nowadays, we are more explicit about
encouraging personal development,
giving people the opportunity to do
something new and exploratory for
them.
I feel it is enough of a challenge and
a learning experience to get the teams
to thoroughly plan an expedition, go
off and do it, and then return safely
afterwards and write up a superb
report.
KM: Why do you encourage the
students to write up a report of the
journey afterwards?
LC: I think it is very important for the
students who go on an expedition to
reflect on their experiences and you
really notice as you approach the end
of a trip that you start thinking about
what you have gained from it.
Leadership, teamwork,
organisation, time-management,
tolerance and compatibility, self-
confidence, humility, responsibility
for yourself and your team, safety,
communication, project management
and planning are just some of the
many skills that every expedition
member has to apply.
It is also a matter of legacy and,
just as you have spoken to and learnt
from people who have gone on
similar expeditions to your own, it is
important to pass on your knowledge
and wisdom to future explorers.
It is all well and good for people
from older years to go on expeditions
but you need to help younger
students, those in first and second
year, to develop their skills.
That is how we all got where we are
today and it is important to give back
for that reason.
KM: And why do you think it is
that the Board is not more widely
known about?
LC: Although the College Reporter
normally has an article each year,
past expeditions did not publicise
themselves enough. Although it is
less of a problem now with everyone
creating blogs online, people used
to return from an expedition and,
as opposed to writing up their
experiences, immediately started
to think about planning another.
Whilst this is quite a natural thing to
do, it has meant that they have not
always been available to pass on their
knowledge as easily and have not
made the Board more widely known.
KM: What is your background and
how did you come to be the Chair
of the Board?
LC: I am a geologist and have always
enjoyed the outdoors so soon after
gaining my PhD from Queen’s
Belfast, I joined a research group at
the University of Cambridge to go
and work in the Arctic. At the time,
women couldn’t go to the Antarctic
so I decided to go north instead and
was part of a small polar community,
working in Greenland, Svalbard and
Ellesmere Island.
After this, I realised how much I had
benefitted from the help of others
and wanted in some way to support
others to have a go at expeditions. I
became Head of Research and Higher
Education at the Royal Geographical
Society and, although this didn’t
actually involve any research for me,
I was still travelling a lot of the time.
Just before I came to Imperial, I
learnt that the previous Head of
the Exploration Board, Prof. Bob
Schroter, in fact a close friend of
mine, was retiring from the role
and he felt that I would be his
natural successor. I then sat in on
a few meetings, the secretary Nigel
Wheatley taught me the job and the
rest is history!
KM: Have you found your geology
knowledge has helped you on
expeditions?
Oh absolutely! It gives you a unique
understanding of the landscape, why
things are as they are, which helps in
all aspects of a journey.
Geology I find also gives you very
astute observation skills, which is
invaluable in every aspect of planning
an expedition.
KM: Do you have a favourite
expedition in the history of the
board?
LC: I don’t think I could pull out one
as my favourite as each expedition is
special for the individual members
who go on them.
For me, I get most enjoyment out of
watching the students develop from
the first time they approach me with
"Established
