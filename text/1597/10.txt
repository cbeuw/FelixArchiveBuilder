Xuan Chen interviews one of the country’s most
influential man about science, energy and how
he maintains his hair
Getting close to
Cowley
Professor Steven Cowley is the
CEO of the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority
and a part-time professor in plasma
physics here at Imperial College. But
that’s not what catches the attention
of an entire cohort of physics
undergraduates every year – it’s his
lectures, where his charisma and
confidence along with sheer passion
for the subject captivates the young
audience.
The fact that someone so important
still has to make trips into Lecture
Theatre One to teach undergraduate
material to a bunch of unruly
students is baffling to some.
Steve is preparing a presentation
on a small laptop when I arrive at his
office to interview him. The space,
which he shares with three other
academics, is modest, featuring a few
desks and chairs along with a worn-
out sofa in the corner and a slightly
grubby plasma ball on the windowsill.
Xuan Chen: So, tell us what you do,
in a (toroidal) nutshell?
Steven Cowley: I’m the CEO of the
United Kingdom Energy Authority,
and the Head of Association with
EURATOM – the European Atomic
Energy Community. This means that
I lead research into fusion, and even
though I’m a theoretical physicist, I
run experiments, too. I still have some
time to sit down and solve problems
as a theoretical physicist. That’s what
I really enjoy, but that time gets
shorter and shorter every day.
XC: You have three fellowships
(Royal Society, Royal Academy
of Engineering, and Institute of
Physics), and a Glazebrook medal
for leadership in physics. Have I
missed anything out?
SC: No. Awards are very important,
and it’s lovely to receive them. I’m
chuffed to receive awards, but more
than anything else I want to see
fusion happen in my lifetime. It is
that important that we solve this
problem.
At the end of the day there is
nothing I like better than to sit with
a problem in front of me which isn’t
solved. And I have less and less time
to do that. You don’t choose a career
in physics to become a celebrity. I do
what I do because I want to see fusion
solved in my lifetime, and fusion has
immense challenges ahead of it.
One of the scientists I’ve been
reading up on lately is Enrico Fermi,
someone very influential in the
first nuclear experiments. My thesis
advisor had lectures from Fermi.
Fermi was a godlike figure, but a
very humble man, who liked nothing
better than to solve equations, and to
work with students.
That’s the fun thing about physics
– not being looked up to, because he’s
working with people. I’m working
with some young people, who get
there faster than I do now, and that’s
just great fun to be with. I enjoy
physics for the social aspect: working
together with other scientists to solve
things together.
XC: Exactly how important is
fusion to our future?
SC: Think of it this way: we have a
world which is very unequal, at the
moment. Some people live very well,
and consume lots of energy. And,
some people don’t live very well, and
consume very little energy.
If we want to solve this inequality,
and bring billions of people up to
the standard of living we enjoy, they
are going to have to consume more
energy – about a factor of two or
three in the next forty years.
How we’re going to supply that
energy without completely messing
up the atmosphere, I don’t know,
except if we can crack these hard
scientific puzzles. In the long
term, we have to think about solar,
advanced fission reactions in breeder
reactor, and fusion, the only ones
which have enough capacity to
sustain us.
Fusion is a very attractive energy
source; it’s clean, and sustainable (at
least for the next 30 million years),
but is very hard to actually do. As a
scientist, that’s what’s also makes it so
attractive; if it were easy, it wouldn’t
be as much fun!
There are, throughout history,
human quests where we try to
conquer something, like flying.
For hundreds of years people tried
to fly and when the breakthrough
happened, the whole world suddenly
changed forever.
I think fusion is like that and
for me, that was one of the great
attractions; to be really involved with
something that is really difficult that
would really change the world. I saw
that it would be helpful; I saw that it
would be something that really has to
be pursued, but also something I just
thought that it would be fun. And it
has been fun!
XC: How did you get into fusion?
Did you choose fusion or did
fusion choose you?
SC: I decided to go into fusion when I
was in my final year of undergraduate
studies. It was 1980 which was around
the time of the first ‘oil shocks’. Oil
prices rose nearly 400% in a few
months, and it was becoming clear
that we don’t have unlimited sources
of fossil fuels, and we can’t burn all of
them anyway.
At that time, a lot of research was
going into the tokomak and it was
becoming clearer that fusion was
something that is possible; it could
be done! So I went to Princeton to
do my PhD, as it was really carrying
out the forefront of physics research
at that time. After that, I carried
out postdoctoral research back
here at JET (Joint European Torus,
Oxfordshire), then went back to the
States for fifteen years. I came back to
Imperial at around 2000.
XC: What is your background?
Were there any figures in your life
who inspired you?
SC: I grew up in Cambridgeshire
and did my undergraduate degree
at Oxford. At that time, I was a lazy,
good-for-nothing student who didn’t
work very much. When I went to
Princeton to do my PhD, however,
I was suddenly surrounded by
incredibly intelligent, hard-working
people- at that time, everyone there
was working on string theory.
We used to get up at eight, work
on physics and solve problems until
eleven at night, and then go to the
bar. At 12:30 we would set our alarms
and get back up at eight the next day
to keep going. That’s where I learnt
to be a physicist. About 10% talent,
and 90% hard work and dedication. If
you’re an undergraduate at Imperial,
you have the talent already.
My father was a scientist; he taught
engineering at Cambridge, so I grew
up in a family in which engineering
was very, very important. So even
though I’m a theoretical physicist, I
"There is
nothing I
like better
than to
sit with a
problem
in front
of me
which isn’t
solved."
"I was
a lazy,
good-for-
nothing
student
who didn’t
work very
much."
