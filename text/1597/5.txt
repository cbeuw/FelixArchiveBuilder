Every day I’m tunnellin’
For the first time in recent
memory,a tour of Imperial’s
famous underground tunnels were
put on offer to the whole Imperial
community.While previous tours
have ran,one example being an
Alumni trip,this tour organised by
RAG was open to anyone with £25
to spare.
Naturally,I bought my place as
soon as I was told about the sale,
and on Tuesday lunchtime,down
the tunnels I went.The party I was
in entered through a oddly high
up door deep in a Blackett plant
room–the difference in heat was
striking! The rather small tunnel
was just about able to take a single
bit like a bowling ball, or be at the
receiving end of some Breaking Bad
jokes.
“Plus I think I am going to miss my
hair keeping me warm!”
Other charities RAG are donating
to this year include Tiny Tickers,
who endeavour to train professionals
to detect heart conditions in young
children, St Mungo’s Broadway
who are committed to helping the
homeless, and the Mines Advisory
Group, who are dedicated to clearing
land mines in war torn countries.
Felix spoke to Ben Fernando, a
third year Physicist and current
RAG Chair, about the planning and
preparation for the week. He said
things had gone very smoothly,
although the RAG launch event on
the Monday was the most difficult to
organise.
“Co-ordinating things for then was
pretty tough, especially as we had the
bungee jump, the band playing and
also the senior College staff making
pancakes. We also needed plans to
cover for bad weather, but luckily

average-sized person–the walls
were clad with large water,steam,
and drainage pipes as well as
conduits for ICT cabling.
The temperature varied wildly
as we walked,crouched,and (in
some places) crawled through
the labyrinth of tunnels under
Imperial.Occasionally we would
stop to admire various pieces of
interest around the network–such
as ancient graffiti sprawled all
across the walls from explorers
past,the huge EDF heat and power
facility under EEE (this generates
the infamous steam),and the over
100 year old paddle fan under
RCS1.
Our guide explained the purpose of
the various services provided in the
tunnels,which included extra-high
voltage electricity for servicing the
labs in ACE.One point of notice was
the very long corridor underneath
Exhibition Road over to South and
Eastside.
Our guide told us the route was
sealed years ago as part of a wider
modernisation scheme to keep
out squatters–the works included
addition of swipecard protection to
all the doors,and modern lighting.
Through some of the oldest tunnels
accessed through a boiling hot
sub-basement in Biochemistry,we
accessed the foundations of the
Queen’s Tower.Armed with sharpies,
we added to the masses of graffiti
on the concrete base.A few of us
even climbed through the holes and
stood directly in the centre of the
tower–our guide explained that
in the past a homeless man would
regularly spend the night in the
concrete cavern.We ended our tour
shortly after,climbing up a ladder
and popping out of a trapdoor onto
the Queen’s Lawn,much to the
bemusement of passers by.
In reflection,it’s quite clear
why students aren’t usually
welcome down there–without
the knowledge of someone who
knows the area,it was easy to get
disorientated and lost.
In some cases,faulty pipes leaked
scalding hot high-pressure steam
into the tunnel,and other parts
were flooded.But by far the most
dangerous part was the ladder to
access the base of Queen’s Tower
–visitors had to also avoid the
boiling hot uninsulated pipe placed
conveniently above the ladder.
All in all it was a fantastic tour,
travelling somewhere usually
forbidden definitely gave the burst
of adrenaline and excitement I
expected.
My thanks to both the Estates
Division and RAG.I hope it continues
again next year.
for both days the weather stayed
relatively dry.”
Fernando also wanted to run a
zip line from the top of the Central
Library down onto Queen’s Lawn, but
apparently the scaffolding needed to
set it up was too expensive.
Felix asked Fernando if Imperial
RAG would ever consider joining
forces with the Imperial College
School of Medicine Student Union
RAG team, who had their RAG Week
last week, and he said it would be
unlikely.
“We don’t really interact; we talk to
ensure when we plan our events they
don’t clash but that is about it.”
It doesn’t look like RAG will be
introducing a pub crawl similar to the
infamous Circle Line pub crawl any
time soon either.
Said Fernando, “I don’t think the
pub crawl fits in with the image we
want to promote, to be honest.”
Although the Week isn’t quite
over yet, and there are still more
events planned for later this term,
the fundraising target from this
week is £10,000, a figure Fernando is
comfortable they will reach.
On Monday alone RAG raised
around £1700 in cash donations, and
have collected almost £4000 donated
through their website.
The committee have already turned
their attention to next year’s RAG
Week plans.
Fernando told us RAG is currently
in talks with College over getting
timetabled afternoons off so all
students could take part, so watch
this space!
