"Are these
pesticides

humans?"
In the last few years, the solar
photovoltaic (PV) industry has
experienced a boom like never
before. In 2013, installed global PV
capacity increased by just under 40%,
from 102GW in peak conditions, or
GWp, in 2012 to 139GWp in 2013.
Accessing the economies of scale
associated with this huge ramp up in
production, prices are falling below
the milestone $1/Wp, according to an
Imperial College London/Grantham
Institute report last November. Some
countries are starting to reach “grid
parity” – a term which essentially
describes the potential for solar power
to compete with conventional (fossil
fuel) generation in electricity markets
without the need for subsidies.
When people talk excitedly about
this success, they are almost entirely
referring to crystalline silicon-based
Photovoltaic solar power (c-Si PV).
Last year the International Energy
Agency estimated that c-Si’s market
share of all PV technologies had
grown to around 90%, with the
remaining 9% constituting almost
entirely of what’s known as Thin-
Film PV, a more flexible, less energy
intensive alternative seen as the
second generation of PV technologies.
In fact, apart from a brief concern
over stability of silicon supply chains
in 2009 which allowed Thin-Film PV
to take around a 15% wedge of the
market, c-Si has almost always been
the vastly dominant solar technology.
Perhaps on the back of this
success, there have been a wave
of new technologies, the so-called
third generation solar technologies,
which are hoping to capitalise on
the enthusiasm felt in current solar
markets by exploiting some of the
problems seen with traditional PV.
Indeed, despite its current
hegemony, c-Si PV is by no means
a perfect technology. Its recent and
historical success is arguably rooted
in policy commitments.
For example, Germany’s the
revolutionary Feed-in Tariff for
silicon-based PV in 2000 encouraged
industry standardisation, an
increasingly secure supply chain and
global market acceptance. Of course,
this should not be used to undermine
c-Si PV’s success but, crucially, and
fascinatingly, this does mean there is
room for improvement, as is always
the case with new tech.
What’s all the fuss about?
One of the biggest problems faced by
c-Si cells is that they are limited to a
maximum theoretical efficiency (i.e.
the maximum amount of the sunlight
that hits a solar panel that can be
converted into electricity) of around
33% with solar efficiency tables in
recent years consistently recording
them at around the 25% mark.
This limit, known as the Shockley-
Queisser limit after its discoverers,
essentially exists due to the fact that
sunlight reaches the Earth at many
different wavelengths, only some of
which can be absorbed by silicon cells
to generate electricity.
By contrast, using combinations
of different semiconductors such as
gallium arsenide and germanium,
so-called ‘multi-junction’ (MJ) cells
can expand the range of wavelengths
absorbed by the cell overall,
generating more electricity. To do
this requires sunlight to be highly
concentrated via parabolic mirrors or
lenses onto the cell area and, as recent
laboratory tests by the Fraunhofer
ISE in Freiburg have recorded, can
produce staggering efficiencies of
46%.
In actual fact, some of these
Concentrator Photovoltaic (CPV)
systems using MJ cells are already
operational with one in Arizona
producing electricity with cell
efficiencies of around 36%. Further
modelling by Illinois State University
of potential future CPV locations in
the Southwest USA has shown that
any project which is situated in an
area with direct sunlight greater than
5.4 kWh/m2
– the amount of sunlight
you might expect from a holiday in
Southern Italy as a very rough idea
– can have a higher Internal Rate
of Return than equivalent c-Si PV
projects.
Not all Sunshine and Roses
Necessarily with every new
technology, CPV has its drawbacks.
Unlike conventional c-Si PV
which can produce electricity
in normal daylight even with
cloud cover (although obviously
not as efficiently), CPV systems
can only function properly with
direct sunlight, or Direct Normal
Irradiance (DNI), that hits modules
at the right angle so that light can be
concentrated in the right direction,
namely, onto the small and highly
efficient MJ cell area. As a result,
CPV systems often need highly
accurate solar trackers to make sure
they are always receiving as much
direct light from the sun as possible.
This in turn pushes up both economic
and energy costs, although studies
from the University of California,
Berkeley find that energy costs are
still generally regarded as competitive
with conventional PV.
So it is not for everyone. CPV can
only really be deployed at utility-scale
