of any background, yet not lose
its ability to explore nuanced and
difficult topics with sophistication.
Art should be innovative and strive
to find new means of expression if it
is to stay relevant, but must honour
its cultural predecessors if it is to
be intelligible. The Mastersingers
both espoused this philosophy and
embodied it with great success;
within a year it was performed all
over Germany and became a symbol
for the unification of the country. In
modern Britain, it is hard to imagine
how an opera – a form seen as elitist –
could have such relevance. Although
I doubt it will change this fact, the
ENO’s new production should enjoy
broad appeal, and handles the finer
points with tact. History has tainted
The Mastersingers’ reputation, and
presented problems for directors.
Having been appropriated by the
Nazi party, Sachs’ final monologue
has been dressed in rather sinister
clothes. After celebrating the value of
the guild’s traditions and the German
cultural heritage, Sachs warns of
foreign influence: “What is German
and true none would know, if it did
not live in the honour of German
masters.”
Throughout the 20th
Century,
many directors, particularly in
America, have decided to cut this
scene or intervene in other ways,

fearing its nationalistic tone. It is
however, important to understand
that these words would have
sounded very different in 19th
Century Germany than they do to
us in a post-Nazi Europe. A more
sympathetic interpretation of the
monologue might be suggested. As
we have discussed, Wagner often
writes on the importance of art as a
communication between people of
shared cultural & linguistic heritage.
He believed that German art could
only provide all its riches to German
people, who would share in a rich
set of cultural contexts necessary
to fully understand it. This applies
to any group of people, and while
not entirely innocent, this view is
certainly far less sinister than those
circulated in the early 20th
Century.
In this ENO production, the director,
Richard Jones, has dealt with the issue
intelligently and appropriately. As
the opera closes, the Nurembergers
hold up the faces of German cultural
heroes: composers, artists, writers,
filmmakers, actors and architects;
and celebrate their contributions to
human thought.
Jones shows his intelligence and
skill throughout. The production is
slick, dynamic and frequently very
funny. The sets seem to depict some
sort of simplified reality, but retain
detail where it matters. The crowds
are used brilliantly to depict in one
moment a chaotic riot, and at the
other the solemn uniformity of the
church – the chorus is excellent.
Musically, Edward Gardner conducts
a modern Mastersinger, shedding
the bombast and weight of previous
interpretations in favour of flexibility
and sensitivity. The orchestra has
moments of utter brilliance, and
only loses its composure when the
on-stage brass is added to the mix
– a crucial mistake which I trust
will be addressed in subsequent
performances.
All the cast is excellent but, as
is understandable in such a long
performance, shows inconsistencies
here and there. Gwyn Hugh Jones
plays a passionate and pre-occupied
Walther. His love, Eva, is portrayed
by Rachel Nicholls with grace, but
perhaps she lacks the spontaneity
that would really allow us to relate
to her character. The antagonist,
Beckmesser (Andrew Shore), was
handled less well, although the blame
for this should lie with the director.
His humiliation in the second act
is so complete and absolute that his
further scheming in the third seems
forced and incongruent. Wagner’s
great coup of world-play at the finale,
which should serve to finally rule out
Beckmesser’s pretensions, is served
weak and cruel. In fact, due to the
translation to English the genius of
this scene is missed entirely.
I do have to say that Shore plays
the part with near-perfect comedic
instincts and has the voice to
match. Hans Sachs is of course
the keystone in the opera, and, in
one of the longest roles in operatic
existence, he sees what others do not
see and manoeuvres the story to its
conclusion. Iain Paterson debuts
in this marathon and does so with
stunning confidence and humanity –
he is sure to become one of the great
Wagner singers of his generation.
I am sure that the name of Richard
Wagner has passed over your ears
at some point or another. In any
case, you will have felt his influence,
whether in film music or more
academic genres. If you are at all
curious, this is the production to see.
It is not only enjoyable and funny,
but deals with Wagner’s difficult
themes head-on, with sophistication,
and a no-nonsense approach.
The Mastersingers of Neurenberg is on
until the 10th
March. Tickets available
online.
