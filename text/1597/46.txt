Sport Editor: Kunal Wagle
That is what Sachin Tendulkar has being telling Indian fans in the latest advertising campaign for the World Cup.
On the eve of the tournament, Kunal Wagle tells Felix what to expect.
“Come, let’s live the dream again”
England
Best World Cup Performance:
Final (1987, 1992)
ODI Ranking: 5
Key Player:
After England installed him as captain Eoin
Morgan will be desperate to prove that the
decision to remove Alistair Cook as captain is
justified.
But also look out for:
Alex Hales and Jos Buttler are explosive
batsmen when they are on song and could make
or break England’s World Cup with their batting
in the tournament.
Australia
Best World Cup Performance:
Champions (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007)
ODI Ranking: 1
Key Player:
Australia’s new ball pairing were destructive
in the Carlton-Mid Tri Series against England
and India, with Mitchell Starc twice removing
two batsmen in the opening overs. And Mitchell
Johnson isn’t bad either.
But also look out for:
He’s started to call himself the man Australia
can rely on, and if Glenn Maxwell can pair that
with his aggressive batting, Australia can expect
some very high totals.
Sri Lanka
Best World Cup Performance:
Champions (1996)
ODI Ranking: 4
Key Player:
Kumar Sangakkara has announced that he will
retire from ODI cricket after this World Cup.
He is Sri Lanka’s leading run scorer and seems
to be getting better every day. He carries with
him Sri Lanka’s hopes.
But also look out for:
Lasith Malinga has been hailed as the greatest
death bowler ever, and he knows that opposition
batsmen will fear that toe-crushing in-swinging
yorker.
Bangladesh
Best World Cup Performance:
Super Eights (2007)
ODI Ranking: 9
Key Player:
Bangladeshi captain Mashrafe Mortaza is
a medium-fast bowler who has shown the
potential to be a big threat.
But also look out for:
Shakib Al-Hasan will be keen to demonstrate
why overturning his ban was a good call.
New Zealand
Best World Cup Performance:
Semi-Finals (1975, 1979, 1992, 1999, 2007, 2011)
ODI Ranking: 6
Key Player:
Kiwi batsman Kane Williamson has
transformed himself over the last few years into
New Zealand’s best batsman.
But also look out for:
Like Australia, New Zealand’s new ball pair,
which is made up of Trent Boult and Tim
Southee, are very strong.
Afghanistan
Best World Cup Performance:
Debut
ODI Ranking: 11
Key Player:
At age 30, Nawroz Mangal is the elder
statesman of the Afghanistan squad and will
thus want to lead by example.
But also look out for:
Captain Mohammad Nabi is usually
Afghanistan’s most reliable player.
Scotland
Best World Cup Performance:
Group Stage (1999, 2007)
ODI Ranking: 9
Pool A
South Africa
Best World Cup Performance:
Semi-Final (1992, 1999, 2007)
ODI Ranking: 3
Key Player:
AB de Villiers put his name in the record books
(again) by blasting the fastest century in ODI
cricket last month.
But also look out for:
Hashim Amla is South Africa’s opener and the
newly installed Test captain will be keen to show
that he is just as valuable in the short form of
the game as the long form.
India
Best World Cup Performance:
Champions (1983, 2011)
ODI Ranking: 2
Key Player:
Having had a stellar test series down under,
Virat Kohli had a quiet tri-series against
England and Australia. He knows he is one of
the best batsmen in the world, and has a great
opportunity to prove it.
But also look out for:
The key to India’s chances will be how their
fragile bowling line up fares on the flat decks in
Australia. The injury to Ishant Sharma will have
done them no favours as well.
Pakistan
Best World Cup Performance:
Champions (1992)
ODI Ranking: 7
Key Player:
Shahid Afridi has announced that he will retire
from ODIs after the World Cup. Despite this,
he knows that, with both bat and ball, he has the
ability to win games for his country. And lose
them.
But also look out for:
Also retiring is captain Misbah-ul-Haq. He is
the mainstay of the Pakistan middle order and
will be desperate to end his limited overs career
on a high in Melbourne.
West Indies
Best World Cup Performance:
Champions (1975, 1979)
ODI Ranking: 8
Key Player:
Explosive batsman Chris Gayle can win a game
for the West Indies in the first ten overs. In a
time of turmoil for the team, he will be expected
to come up with some hefty blows.
But also look out for:
Darren Sammy could be key to the West
Indies’ hopes.
Zimbabwe
Best World Cup Performance:
Super Sixes (1999, 2003)
ODI Ranking: 10
Key Player:
In the victory against Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe’s top
order batsman Hamilton Masakadza scored a
brilliant century to guide his country home.
But also look out for:
In the same game, Sean Williams was very
impressive. He took three wickets at a cost of
only 35 runs in ten overs.
Ireland
Best World Cup Performance:
Super Eights
ODI Ranking: 12
Key Player:
The hero of Ireland’s 2011 campaign,
Kevin O’Brien will be eager to showcase his
destructive ability again this time around.
But also look out for:
Surrey’s wicketkeeper-batsman Gary Wilson
took Ireland close to the Quarter-Finals in 2011,
but succumbed to a shocking LBW decision.
United Arab Emirates
Best World Cup Performance:
Group Stage (1999, 2007)
ODI Ranking: 9
Pool B
