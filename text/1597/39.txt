This week you decide to
use the new instant Google
translate mode in order to
better connect with Imperial’s
Malaysian community. You
ask a guy how his day was and
what he’s having for dinner,
causing him to rush out of
the room. You find him in a
red catsuit with 15 cucumbers
lubed up on the bed.

This week you decide to do the
bungee jump for RAG week;
due to a mishap in appliance
of the bungee cords, as you
jump of your trousers and
underwear come flying off
as you plummet down. Not
only did Ben Fernando see
your genitals, your underwear
is now stuck on the Queen’s
Tower for all to see.
This week you’re a rugby
player. After getting with a
loose netballer in the union,
you take her to Hyde park to
finish the deed. You get caught
on the railings on the way out
and you die.
This week you join the
Imperial University Challenge
team. You arrange the tryouts
for a time when many of the
best candidates can’t make it,
and then you bully the person
who got the 4th place in the
team to drop out for you, but
fuck it, at least you’ll be on TV.

This week you develop a
strange obsession Chris Kaye,
poring over all his Facebook
photos, writing poems about
him. Unfortunately you
discover that due to a mishap
in the physics department,
Chris Kaye now has the ability
to immaculately conceive. You
are impregnated with triplets.
This week you try to capitalise
on the Imperial related
Facebook pages, by creating
one related solely to things
that sometimes happen in
imperial (how hilarious).
Unfortunately this incites
the anger of the orgy master
and he comes to your house,
forcing you to become the
filling in a human centipede
sandwich.
This week, following the
suspension of your Gaelic
football group for allegedly
stealing potatoes, you still are
determined to enter the Hyde
Park relay so you decide to go
under a false name. You fail to
take into account the backlash
from the name “Rolf Harris and
the allegations”.
This week you decide to
sneak into the Baftas in
order to touch Benderdickle
Cumberpickle’s sweet
sumptuous privately educated
face. You decide that disguising
yourself as Helen Mirren is the
best plan of action; however
you are quickly discovered,
and as according to BAFTA
rules, you are made Stephen
Fry’s sex slave.
You thought I was joking about
the fishcakes. Next cook the
potatoes in boiling salted water
for 10 mins. Then leave to
cool in a colander for 2 mins
and return to the pan on a low
setting. Mash the potatoes for
2-3 mins – it should be dry
and fluffy. Stir in lemon zest,
mayonnaise, mustard, capers
and some seasoning.
Friday 6th of February
Today I went out to TigerTiger with my hall friends, as it was someone’s
birthday on another corridor and all the cool kids were going.
It was pretty bad though, I had to pay like £20 to get in, and then I was
kicked out after half an hour as I predrank quite hard and puked up a
mirrored wall.
I drunk dialled American Girl too, which was awkward, as she picked up and
all I kept doing was singing American Pie down the phone. She texted
me after calling me a jerk, and told me not to bother with Valentine’s Day
plans. I didn’t even make any?
Saturday 7th of February
So hungover today, and basically spent all morning slowly throwing up what
felt like half my organs. Went to the library later and just sat on the
fourth floor staring blankly at my laptop for eight hours.
Sunday 8th of February
Still hungover. HOW AM I STILL HUNGOVER
Monday 9th of February
Today I walked onto campus late to morning to lectures, and all I could hear
was high pitched screaming. I was worried maybe finally someone had
snapped and was running around with a sword or something, so decided to
hide in the bushes for a while.

It turned out it was just the people bungee jumping from a crane near Queen’s
Lawn. I’ve told no-one why I was half an hour late to lectures.
Tuesday 10th of February
I went to the library café today for lunch, and saw Dorothy out with Kris, but it
didn’t make me sad anymore. I got a coffee and sat in the corner planning to
Skype Richard at Leeds Uni, as he’s good with girls and might know what I should
do about American Girl.
He said he was busy again getting an outfit together for something called the Otley
run, so I sat there for a bit whatsapping my Mom. Richard is always too busy to
skype since he went back to Leeds after Christmas. Also since he started taking
speed he doesn’t really sleep regular hours either so never replies to my text
messages.
Keeping in touch with friends from home is hard.
Wednesday 11th of February
I went to sports night tonight, and saw American girl. I apologised and she said it
was fine, although I still bought her a couple of snakebites to cheer her up.
We made out in Metric again, I’m such a LAD lol
Thursday 12th of February
HUNGOVER AGAIN WHY GOD WHY
This week in order to get
an advantage in the union
sabbatical position elections,
you decide to beef up your
application with some slightly
exaggerated facts about
yourself. The problem is that
they immediately see through
this and your claims of your
helicopter being shot down
in Afghanistan cause you to
withdraw.
