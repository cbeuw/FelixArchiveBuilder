The Grammys - Kanye not
If you were you too busy watching
Kasabian make a confusing
appearance at the last Sunday’s
BAFTAs, here are our top 5 WTF
moments of the 57th
Grammy Awards.
There were some great moments
musically, like Rihanna, Kanye West
and Paul McCartney’s first live
performance of ‘FourFiveSeconds’,
and some not so great (Ed Sheeran
ruining ELO’s legendary ‘Mr Blue
Sky’ anyone?). It’s hard to comment
solely on the music and arguably this
isn’t what the show’s about. Fashion
bloggers bitched well into the night
about Rihanna’s fucking weird dress
and Madonna’s arse, so here’s a round
up of the slightly more musically
themed water-cooler moments.
What’s a Beck?
Who took away the same number
of Grammys as leader of the free
world, Beyoncé? This guy. Looking
like a withered Ed Sheeran, Beck
walked off with Best Rock Album and
(controversially) Album of the Year.
You probably know his track ‘Loser’;
the opening sounds a bit like the
Breaking Bad theme and he moans the
chorus: “Soy un perdedor/I’m a loser
baby/So why don’t you kill me?” He’s
released a ridiculous twelve studio
albums since the 90s, collaborated
with everyone from Pearl Jam to
Pink and once released a record as
sheet music only. Seriously.
Despite sounding like a bit of mug,
he looked pretty astonished to be
up there, and said at an after party
that he had expected Beyoncé to win.
Many expressed confusion on Twitter
– who was he, where had he come
from and how he managed to triumph
over Queen Bey, who dropped a
critically acclaimed visual album with
zero notice? The girl who didn’t know
who Paul McCartney was must have
been totally flummoxed. Kanye also
had opinions on the matter, but we’ll
get to that.
Oh, Kanye
It could have been 2009 all over
again. People had pointed out in the
rehearsals that Kimye were seated
right by the podium, but Kanye West
became the most tweeted about star
on Sunday night (despite not winning
anything) by hopping onstage as Beck
(who? – see above) waved his Album
of the Year trophy in poor Bey’s face.
But then, oh how we collectively
sighed in relief as we realised, it
was just him playing a little trick!
He wasn’t going to go full “I’m-a let
you finish but…” at all! Oh Kanye,
how you’ve grown. Then just when
we thought he’d found his sense of
humour after all the incidents of late
(Barack Obama calling him a jackass
and that Zane Lowe interview) Yeezy
ruins it all by mouthing off about
Beck at an after party. “If they want
real artists to keep coming back, they
need to stop playing with us,” he said,
adding, “[Beck] should have given his
award to Beyoncé.” Yikes.
Prince knows what’s up
Introducing Album of the Year was
the Purple One himself. He’s been
pretty quiet since those surprise
London shows and being on New
Girl, so this really was exciting.
It clearly wasn’t for him though,
and he mooched onstage looking
as unimpressed as we all probably
should be at an awards ceremony with
all the pomp and irrelevance to music
as the Grammys. Any awarding body
that gives Best Metal Performance
to a band it had given Best Comedy
Album to a few years previously,
probably doesn’t respect all the
genres. Anyway, dressed in a peach
suit that some likened to an orange
prison jumpsuit, he introduced the
category by referencing the recent
shootings of unarmed black youths
by police, saying, “Like books and
black lives, albums still mater”. Go
Prince.
Chill out Sia
God I love you, Sia, but everyone
knows what you look like. Having
only started to perform facing away
from the audience relatively recently,
pictures of her face do exist on the
internet. We get it, it’s more of a
performance art thing, and she’s
amazing, having written Beyoncé’s
‘Pretty Hurts’, Rihanna’s ‘Diamonds’
and providing the vocals on Flo
Rida’s ‘Wild Ones’ that make it
slightly better than truly awful. She
did her usual thing at the Grammys,
bringing along tiny dancing muse
Maddie Ziegler and bizarrely, star of
Bridesmaids and SNL regular Kristen
Wiig. Perhaps even weirder than
Wiig’s inclusion was the fact that her
dancing was totally on point.
World forgives Sam Smith
Less than a month after Sam Smith
was ordered give writing credit to
Tom Petty for ‘Stay With Me’, due
to its striking similarities to ‘Won’t
back down’ (seriously, have a listen)
he bags the Grammy for Record of
the Year. Record of the year in terms
of, record that must’ve been played
enough times this year to annoy even
Smith, but presumably not Petty, who
got an undisclosed but presumably
sweet settled-out-of-court sum.
Reminiscent of 2011, aka the year
of Adele, a Brit took home the most
awards, including best song, best
pop vocal album and best new artist,
beating the loveable Bastille. And
like Adele, he thanked the ex who
inspired it all.
Who needs a man when you’ve got
an arm full of Grammys?
