Human Rights: the Sight and the Fury
Fred Fyles looks at two contrasting exhibitions of photography
“Everything can be explained to the
people, on the single condition that you
really want them to understand”
– Frantz Fanon, The Wretched of the
Earth
Bombings. Famine. Conflict. As
images of these atrocities jump
out of me from black and white
photos adorning the walls of The
Photographers’ Gallery, the words
of polemical anti-colonialist Frantz
Fanon ring in my mind. In his most
famous work, The Wretched of the
Earth, he advocates for those who are
colonised to use violence as a tool for
political freedom. While Fanon sees
conflict as a necessity, the exhibition
Human Rights Human Wrongs shows
that it seems to be an inevitability: a
side effect of living on our fractured
planet.
Taking the 1948 Universal
Declaration of Human Rights as a
starting point, The Photographers’
Gallery explores the archive of the
Black Star Photography Agency,
who are legendary for their
photojournalism. Picking a collection
of photographs from numerous
conflicts of the last 60 years, the
exhibition spans the globe, in what
is quite possibly the most depressing
world tour; starved Biafran orphans
staring forlornly out at the lens;
women marching in the Plaza de
Mayo in Argentina, highlighting their
plight as the mothers of ‘disappeared’
children; and Algerian bards, singing
ballads against French colonialism in
Tunisia during protests.
With Selma being released in
cinemas to critical acclaim, it
seems a ripe time to revisit the civil
rights campaign, and photographs
of Martin Luther King by Charles
Moore and Bob Fitch help humanise
the legend, revealing the edges that
were smoothed away in his journey
to become an icon. Other photos
allow us to starkly draw a link
between the present and the past,
with Willie Nkosi’s photograph of
black protesters in Soweto during
the late 1970s reminding us of recent
scenes in Ferguson. The signs around
their necks read “Don’t shoot. We
are marching. We are not fighting”,
showing us that then, as now, black
bodies are not safe from the force of
an imperialist government.
However, with many of these
photos there is a sense of ‘been
there, done that’. As Susan Sontag
says: “Images transfix. Images
anaesthetize”. In our media-saturated
world it has become difficult for an
image to retain the power to shock,
to stun. While it is imaginable that
these images caused a furore when
they were first published, revealing
a hidden reality, globalisation has
meant that rather than being placed
out of view, such acts are instead
thrust upon us.
This attitude is not helped by the
way the photographs are presented;
instead of presenting them
chronologically, or geographically,
we flit around, from one place to
another. Starting off in Vietnam, we
might then head to Alabama in the
‘60s, then Algeria, then Morocco in
the ‘70s, and then back to Vietnam.
While I understand that this may
have been a deliberate ploy to
overwhelm us with the sheer volume
of horror humanity can produce,
the effect is actually that we become
disorientated, and the narrative that
we have been building is fractured.
The exhibition succeeds where
it presents a view of the world that
we are unfamiliar with; the power
of great photography is that it can
alter the way that we perceive what
is happening around us, and this is
clear in the photographs that explore
how women are treated within war.
In one photo from Vietnam we see
a group of white soldiers engaging
with local women, who we presume
to be prostitutes. The slack-jawed
grins plastered on the faces of the
Americans is sickening, and as we
gaze at them gazing at the women, it
is difficult to feel anything other than
sheer disgust.
In one photo, things are taken
further; as well as the photographs
we are told the captions written on
the back; in this one an Angolan
woman stares out at the camera,
and the caption tells us that “she
makes propaganda for a black-white
community”. While this view seems
somewhat optimistic, it is certainly a
novelty in an exhibition that seems to
be lacking in new ideas.
The lack of context for many of
the photos is also an issue; unless
you have a generally good idea of
the innumerable conflicts since
1948, it can be difficult to tell what
is happening in the photograph.
However, some ideas are universal;
in my favourite photograph of the
exhibition, entitled Red China, a
woman stares forlornly at a pair
of shoes, her tired eyes and worn
clothing contrasting against the
glamour of the Western-style
accessories. It is a reminder that not
all conflicts involve bloodshed, and
not all injustice concerns violence.
Once you have been emotionally
drained by these harrowing
photographs, you can head down to
the Photographers’ Gallery’s other
exhibition, which offers a welcome
change of tone. Anima and the Wildest
Prairies, the first UK solo exhibition
by Dutch photographer Charlotte
Dumas, displays a collection of
photographs of wild horses living in
Nevada. Framed against a wide-open
Southern sky that stretches across
the photograph, powerful horses
wander free, exemplifying the power
and might of the natural world. With
nary a human in sight, Dumas’ work
is an exploration of man vs. machine.
The natural might of the mountains
and the glamourous majesty of the
animals suggests that they have the
edge.
But what is more impressive is
Dumas’ work Anima, a video of the
horses used for military funerals in
the USA falling asleep in their stables.
Framed like classical paintings,
Dumas’ skill with light is apparent,
evoking the memory of the old
masters; observing these horses as
they slowly drift into dreamland feels
like a sort of transgression, as if we
are trespassing on private property.
It’s the kind of work that I could
watch for an age: slow, deliberate,
and beautiful. It also gives us a time
to reflect on the things I have seen
upstairs in the Human Right Human
Wrongs exhibition. After the horrors
of the human world, it’s a welcome
relief to be able to slip into a tranquil,
animal one.
Human Rights Human Wrongs and
Charlotte Dumas: Anima and the
Wildest Prairies are both on at The
Photographers’ Gallery until 6th
April.
