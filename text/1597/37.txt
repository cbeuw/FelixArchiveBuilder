the idea to when they return safely to
my office just after they come back,
having seen through their proposal
safely from start to finish.
Having said that, with my
mountaineering and polar
experience, when I get an exciting
trip related to those, I do sometimes
wish I could go on them, although
this doesn’t affect the kind of trips
that are endorsed in the end. For
example, your trip across Central Asia
is one I would love to do when I one
day retire, although maybe not at the
kind of pace you will be doing it!
KM: There is always an element
of danger in expeditions despite
precautions taken but has anything
ever gone seriously wrong on one
of the Board’s expeditions?
LC: It is sobering to read the report
of the 1961 Beerenberg expedition
to North Jan Mayen Island on which
there were five fatalities and the
report serves in part as a fitting
tribute to those who perished. Most
of the party had been to Svalbard,
operating boats and mountaineering,
the previous year.
The expedition of 8 men had been
operating as two parties, one in
the northwest and the other in the
southwest of the island. Two of the
northern party travelled by a small,
rigid hulled, metal boat to pick up
the southern party. The outward
journey had taken several hours. On
the return journey the wind got up,
they hit a sudden squall, the boat was
overturned some 35 metres from
the shore. 5 out of 6 died; and even
after considerable searching only one
body was found. Other expeditions
have suffered the occasional accident
and sadly fatality but not to such an

extent.
KM: Due to the expense of
expeditions, it seems they have
historically been more of a rich
person’s retreat. Do you feel this is
still the case?
LC: Imperial College has always had
a tradition to support their students
to undertake expeditions; this is the
raison d’etre for the Board’s existence.
Having funding and approval from
the Board can open doors to Trust
funds and other charities.
Many of the expeditions over the
years were undertaken by fund-
raising, borrowing equipment, gifts of
food and equipment from suppliers,
and finding a place to travel to within
their means. These are all useful
skills for future employment.
Most expeditions can be completed
within the budget of each individual

student.
In some of the earlier expeditions
students do not seem to have been
constrained by the need to find a
job and some expeditions seemed to
proceed at quite a leisurely pace.
Take the expedition to Africa
and the Americas in 1960 which
ran from March to November
involving overland travel across
both continents undertaking a
survey of private light aircraft and
their activities. Nobody these days
would be likely to have the time and
resources to undertake this type of
expedition.
KM: Is there one place you have
never been that you would still
love to go to?
LC: There are lots of wonderful places
still to go to, and the world is full of
fantastic journeys that I would love to
make. It’s impossible for me to pick
out one! There are a whole host of
places that I would love to visit, and
hope to one day.
KM: And what is your next
adventure?
LC: Travelling in the Arctic is a
wonderful way to meet people who
often later become your close friends.
This summer, with the help of some
Greenlandic friends, I am travelling
to a remote settlement in the north
west of Greenland, leaving loads
of time for potential delays so that
I am back in time for my College
commitments…
KM: Finally, what do you say to
those who may not have much
experience of expeditions but
would really love to go on one?
LC: 18 expeditions applied to the
Imperial College Exploration Board
this year, of which 13 or 14 will go
ahead. If you have no experience
at all, join one of the clubs or
societies, which can be a great way
to get to know others as well as build
your experience. Most Imperial
expeditions have a good legacy
component and you might find
someone who will be looking for
another member of their expedition
or will take you through the planning
of one. Contact us early on in the
Board and we will do our best to
support you through, or send you
in the direction of someone who
can help you. It’s a fantastic way to
develop your skills and have a superb
experience at the same time.
