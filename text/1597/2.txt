exactly.
Union Council is a group of
about 30 students that have been
elected into various other Union
volunteering positions, like Faculty
Union Presidents, Academic Affairs
Officers, Management Group
Chairs and the like. There are also
representatives that are elected
purely to sit on Council and represent
their Faculty, and they are members
of Council too. They all get one vote
each, and decide to either accept
or reject various papers and their
proposals.
Anyone can take a paper proposing
things to Council, we just vote on
whether or not something in the
paper has the backing of the Union
Council. Proposals have to be
specific too: they have to mandate
Officer Trustees to do something,
like lobby College on our behalf, or
tell the Trustee Board what we agree
or disagree on. For a body that is
Officially The Student Voice, we are
very co-dependant.

This week Union Council made
a lot of decisions that could
potentially affect students in
years to come. We passed a paper
condemning the Counter Terrorism
Bill, another outlining our intentions
to lobby College to divest from fossil
fuels, another stating our plans
to save Pembridge Hall and yet
another about the rent prices for
accommodation.
However, all these decisions don’t
really mean anything unless those
outside of Union Council listen to our
views, which isn’t always guaranteed
to happen. Although we have agreed
that Weeks Hall is inefficient in space
use, and therefore if College were to
close it we would be happy with this,
we have disagreed with the closure of
Pembridge Hall.
College could simply close down
that hall too if need be, since Union
Council doesn’t have the remit to
prevent that from happening. The
Union Council’s remit is actually
pretty narrow: we can mandate and
lobby other powerful people as much
as we like, but at the end of the day,
Union Council power simply lies with
the fact that they are considered to
represent the entirety of the student
body and other people have to do
what we want for us.
I get the impression from talking
to people this week that many don’t
actually know what the Union
Council is, so instead of being all
whiney and opinionated this week, I
thought I would give you a rundown
of who makes up the Official Voice
of the Students and what they do
Fun Felix Fact: I sit on Council and
get a vote as the PG Non Faculty
Representative, not as Felix editor,
meaning I represent part of the
Business School. Its odd how these
things work out.
Debra Humphris, who was present
at the Union Council meeting on
Tuesday, told the students there that
College would listen to the decisions
made about rent prices, although
again we can’t be certain they will
until it is set in stone.
Only last term, when the Union
Council did vote to condemn the
bursary changes, the College changed
them anyway.
Although Union Council isn’t the
only way students are represented,
it seems to be the most effective in
getting the views about students
across. However, it can seem quite
remote as a body; unless those lucky
few students that represent their
faculty talk to their students and gage
their opinions and ideas, having a rep
can be pretty pointless.
You can now see how your various
representatives votes for you, as
voting records are now public on
the Union website. So, if you are
interested in papers in the future, let
your rep know how you feel about it.
And, if they don’t vote in a manner
you agree with, feel free to get in
touch with them and ask why. They
Officially Represent the Student
Voice after all, even if sometimes they
seem to be shouting into the wind.
