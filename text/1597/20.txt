Where is the love?
Alove story that tells things
from the point of view of an
elderly couple is quite a rare
occurrence, and something told in
relation to an elderly homosexual
couple is rarer still. We start our
journey with Ben (John Lithgow)
and George (Alfred Molina) getting
married in New York City. They have
been together for decades now, but
only now are they legally allowed to
have their union recognised by the
state. It is a joyous occasion that calls
for friends and family to gather for
the celebration. But even this happy
state does not last long, as life has a
funny way of balancing everything
out.
George is fired from his teaching
job at a conservative school, after the
institution decides that it would not
be acceptable to have a married gay
teacher teaching their students, and
this leads to financial difficulties for
the couple. Vacating their home is
the least of their worries, as Ben and
George find themselves having to live
apart in separate housing. Ben goes
to live with his nephew Elliot (Darren
E. Burrows), whereas their kind gay
police officer friends (Cheyenne
Jackson and Manny Perez) offer up a
room for George.
It is not the most ideal situation
but they both have to make do.
Ben is unwittingly thrown into the
middle of Elliot’s family drama, one
that involves his nephew’s wife Kate
(Marisa Tomei) and their teenage
son Joey (Charlie Tahan). George too,
struggles with living under the same
roof with the two young men, who
are very socially active, having loud
parties and gatherings almost every
night. But even in the midst of all
this, Love is Strange refuses to venture
into the more dramatic territory.
Things just happen, quietly and
calmly, just like how every day passes
for the rest of us, there is nothing
seemingly extraordinary for Ben
and George. Director Ira Sachs keeps
everything grounded in that you
will not be seeing any grand, showy
performances here.
But it is in the quiet, small, tender
moments that the outstanding
cast elevates the film to excellence.
A particularly touching moment
involves the brief reunion of the
main pair, having not been together
for too long. The film also stays away
`from getting overly political and
preachy in tone – although there
is plenty of space in the script for
it to do so. For instance, the firing
of George for his personal life is a
plot strand that could have been
overextended, but a simple voiceover
of George reading a letter of thanks
and apology to the school’s parents
sums everything up nicely without
any unnecessary tears and drama.
The ending however comes as a bit
of a shock. For a film that maintained
a slow, steady pace throughout its
running time, there is an unexpected
time jump in which a lot seems to
have happened. There are important
questions that are never answered,
and the final few minutes are guilty
of taking some easy, ‘cheat’ routes to
get a fast, neat ending. Regardless, a
relatively weak final act should not
interfere with enjoying the rest of the
beautifully structured narrative.

The Wachowski siblings have
sure had their ups and downs
in terms of the films that
have and have not connected with
audiences worldwide. The Matrix
franchise was something that made
them an internationally recognised
surname, although the films that
have followed since have not been
able to replicate the success their
iconic sci-fi trilogy brought them.
Their credibility’s downward spiral
continues with Jupiter Ascending,
a preposterous, tiresome space
opera that plays very little to the
filmmakers’ strengths and instead
turns into a chaotic, jumbled mess of
a movie that is currently not making
a whole load of money across the
globe.
With a $176 million production
budget (including the nine months
of post-production the film went
through, pushing its release date
back by almost a year), it is easy to
see where all that money went. The
endless supply of flashy computer
graphics portraying space warfare
are of course supposed to be the main
selling point of the film, promising
plenty of action appealing to a wide
demographic of viewers. Sadly with
Jupiter Ascending, there is such a
senseless bombardment of laser
beams, missiles, explosions and
rapid editing that even the scenes
that should have been remotely
enjoyable turn into a string of
incomprehensible, mind-numbing
shots.
Not helping in the slightest is the
convoluted plot that fails to develop
a single character right. Jupiter Jones
(Mila Kunis) is an ordinary cleaner
living in America who is nonetheless
destined for great things. People
who clearly know a thing or two
start calling her “your majesty” and
bees start to randomly swarming
around her, because bees recognise an
individual of royalty. Yes, really.
She gets tossed into a petty
family squabble between three
siblings taking place in space. She
is to play an important role in a
plot of schemes and betrayals that
do not make any sense, and none
of the potential villains (Eddie
Redmayne and Douglas Booth, both
overplaying their campy tone, and
Tuppence Middleton) really rises
to the potential to become anyone
particularly memorable, phasing in
and out then suddenly never to be
heard from and seen again later.
Even worse is how Jupiter Jones
and Caine (Channing Tatum), a
genetically engineered ex-hunter,
connect on a romantic level. Jupiter
has no shame in quite literally
throwing herself onto Caine, whilst
the audience can only cringe at the
hearing of the Wachowskis’ poor
scripting.
The characterisations of the leads
remain baffling and unclear, and half
the time Jupiter is too busy falling
off buildings and other high places
to be contributing in any way to the
plot. Caine is of course there to save
her, pretty much all the time, often
miraculously finding out exactly
where she is.
When moving forward with the
film slowly, the visuals are easier
to take in and marvel at. The
various spaceships and planets we
are introduced to, are impeccably
designed, the residents stemming
from all sorts of weird and wonderful
species living in them too, are also
colourfully decorated from head
to toe. The film however cannot
resist the temptation to just blow
everything up the first chance it gets,
forgetting to focus on everything else
that is important to make a coherent
film.
