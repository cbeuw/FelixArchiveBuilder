A fusion
of physics
and
politics
enjoy the practical side of physics.
Another very influential figure
was Shaun Wiley, one of the
mathematicians who cracked the
Enigma code, who was also my maths
teacher in high school. I think he
had a big influence on me when I was
seventeen or eighteen.
He taught me to appreciate the
satisfaction of solving puzzles, and
the privilege of being paid to do
something you love.
XC: You also sit on the Prime
Minister’s Council for Science and
Technology. How influential are
scientists in policy making?
SC: It is very interesting to see how
politicians interact with scientists.
The Prime Minister is a very serious
man. He takes notes at every meeting,
and is interested in getting the best
out of British science. Everybody
recognises and is proud of our science
and technology base. They definitely
hold scientists in very high regard.
XC: Despite all this, you still have
to teach the undergraduate course
in Electromagnetism, as required
by a professor. How important is
teaching to you?
SC: I like teaching, because even
though what I teach is not at the very
frontier of what we know, it puts me
"It is very
interesting
to see how
politicians
interact
with
scientists."
in contact with students. Famously,
Richard Feynman turned down a
position at the Institute of Advanced
Study at Princeton because it had
no teaching. He proclaimed that
teaching is what keeps you in contact
with young people and young people
are the ones who are going to solve
the next problems. As you get older
as a scientist, you realise that you’re
not going to crack certain problems,
but it would be really nice to see a
young person crack this problem.
When you’re teaching, you’re
meeting people like yourself from
the next generation. Some people, in
my class, I’d like to think are the ones
"Don’t kid
yourself
you
understand
something
if you
don’t.”
producing the next breakthroughs. I
probably don’t get as much time as I’d
like for interacting with students.
XC: Gentleman’s Quarterly
(GQ) ranks you in the top 100
influential men in the country,
ahead of Alexander Lebedev,
Richard Branson, Danny
Alexander, and Brian Cox. I also
understand that you have two
sons – as an influential man, how
do you hope to influence them in
their futures?
SC: I think your children have to find
their own way – it’s a dangerous thing
to expect them to live up to their
parents. They should decide what
they should do with their own lives.
You want your children to enjoy the
things that you enjoy, but actually
they will enjoy the things they enjoy.
And that may not be physics, nor
science – it could be anything. I think
my sons are going to do different
things than me. Being a good parent
is about valuing what your children
value.
XC: Okay – I have some general
questions now, from other students
who are also interested in you and
your work. First of all – how do
you keep your hair so luscious?
SC: (laughs) I don’t think it’s luscious.
It’s going grey, like everyone else’s.
But if I had to say, it’s probably due to
my consumption of sweets.
XC: Are there noticeable
differences in attitude towards
scientists in the UK and the US?
SC: A bit. The American attitude
believing that science can change the
future in a big way is a lot stronger
in the States than in Europe. Here
people worry that things may lead to
more pollution or troubles. I like the
American can-do attitude, and the
pioneer spirit. But to be honest, I’m
an Englishman – I feel more at home
in London.
XC: How much coffee do you
drink?
SC: Too much. I drink until my head
hurts.
XC: What advice would you give to
young scientists?
SC: The most important thing –
don’t kid yourself you understand
something if you don’t.
XC: Some of your second year fans
made this picture of you (inset). Do
you have anything to say?
SC: No comment. There are
embarrassing pictures of me out there
and that particular photo took ages.
The photographer was very fussy
and forced me to pose next to the
electrical plant!
