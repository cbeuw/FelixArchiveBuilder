Jingjie Cheng examines how Drawn by Light reimagines photography
Seeing photography in a new light
Photography exhibitions
are often about particular
movements, themes, or
individual photographers. Rarely
do you find an exhibition as all-
encompassing as this show of the
best of the Royal Photographic
Society’s (RPS) collection. Besides
including instantly recognizable
photos, such as Steve McCurry’s
National Geographic magazine cover
photo Afghan Girl, the exhibition
is notable for its effort to present a
macroscopic view of photographic
history, drawing links across time,
individuals and whole movements.
The Society is in a unique position
as both bystander and participant in
the major photographic milestones of
history, and this exhibition exploits
both these roles ingeniously to create
a fascinating and informative tribute
to the art of photography.
The show is divided into three
sections, each of which reveals a
different facet of photographic
history. ‘Continuity and Change’
juxtaposes similar subject matter in
photos from different time periods
and photographers, creating a
lively dialogue between works that
transcends time and context. The
streaker held by three policemen in
ED Lacey’s photo, for example, and
the naked children in James Jarche’s
Limbs who are also running away
from an officer, unite in a playful
defiance of social decorum.
Across history, there have been
certain recurrent themes that
photographers consistently return to,
and this particular room highlights
these similarities very strikingly.
From the curvaceous bodies of
nudes across time to journalistic
photographs of uncannily similar
compositions of spectators at a
badminton match and bystanders at
a policeman’s funeral, photographs
have captured the timelessness of
the human condition. Particularly
delightful is the 1956 piece by
Philippe Halsman. Inspired by the
jump shots of comedians of the time,
he got the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor to do one too – which they
gamely did, while maintaining their
air of composure and dignity!
The RPS, founded in 1853, is the
world’s oldest surviving photographic
society and its early members consists
of the most famous practitioners
of the time such as Hugh Welch
Diamond and Roger Fenton. It held
its first open exhibition at The South
Kensington Museum in 1858, which
later became the Science Museum
and Victoria and Albert Museum.
The second room of the exhibition
is dedicated to the photographs
and photographers themselves
that represent the ‘Optimism and
Progress’ of the 1850s, a period when
photographic techniques and the
role of photography in society was
developing rapidly.
True to its role as a participant in
the history of photography, the RPS
also has a remarkable collection of
photos of photographers themselves.
In the 1856 piece Photographic Society
outing to Hampton Court, a cluster of
men in top hats are pictured in front
of a carriage, chatting and setting up
equipment on a patch of grass – a
candid but vivid capture of the spirit
of the early RPS. Madame Yevonde’s
self-portrait with a Vivex colour
camera encompasses the concept of
this section of the exhibition – a focus
on the drivers and technology that
shaped the time. In the centre of the
room, there is a recreation of a section
of a photography exhibition as it
would have looked in the 1850s, with
photos densely arranged and with
subject matter ranging from busts at
the British Museum to landscapes.
Aside from photographs, the
exhibition also displays a collection
of equipment significant to the
development of photography. Three
rare original Nièpce heliographs –
the first time someone attempted to
‘draw by light’ – are on display, along
with Henry Talbot’s camera lucida
sketchbook and a portable camera of
the 1850s, among others.
In ‘Personal Vision’, the third and
final room of the exhibition, works
by the same photographer are shown
side by side. Some of these have a
distinct character and highlight
the similarities across works by the
same photographer – for example,
the gentle, otherworldly landscapes
of Ansel Adams or the quirky and
whimsical pictures of Richard Polak.
Others are vastly different and show
the diverse interests of individual
photographers. Roger Fenton, best
known for his photos of the Crimean
War, also took remarkable still life
and landscape pictures. This room
is thus an interesting companion to
the first room – one connects the
dots between subject matter while the
other invites the viewer to pick out
the “personal visions” of individual
photographers’ bodies of work.
Drawn by Light is impressively
comprehensive, with a diverse range
of style and subject across time and
place. Pioneers of photography
are displayed alongside recent
masterpieces, capturing an exquisite
view of photography in its entirety.
Drawing from the collection of such a
historic organization, the exhibition
strikes a fine balance between being
informative and aesthetic. At the
same time, it presents its art in a
cohesive way that challenges any
preconceived notions of individual
photographic movements and
photographers that viewers may come
in with.
Well-organised and easy to
navigate, the RPS collection is
definitely a fascinating and enjoyable
visit.
Drawn by Light: The Royal
Photographic Society Collection is
running until 11th
March in the Science
Museum Media Space. Tickets are £8,
£4.50 for students.
