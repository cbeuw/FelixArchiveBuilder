38 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
HANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk
EXCLUSIVE: Hangman discovers sinister plot to open new
catering empire in the former Weeks Hall
After students at the Union
Council voted to condemn
Weeks Hall, Hangman has
investigated the future plans for the
now derelict building.
Union Council voted to allow the
building to be used for “non academic
and academic use,” and although
it was initially suggested it could
provide childcare facilities, it has
been revealed that it will now house
the new TasteImperial Headquarters,
named Commercial Services Corp.
The building will be transformed
into one giant food hall, spanning
six floors. There will also be a bar,
although this will only serve alcohol
after 5pm so as not to encourage
academics turning to liquor so early
on in the day.
Although the plans remain top
secret, Hangman was able to sneak
into the preliminary meetings,
dressed as a busboy and pushing
a trolley featuring SCR breakfast
delicacies, including three-day-old
scrambled eggs and soggy bacon.
Whilst serving up coffee Hangman
overheard the plans to turn one whole
floor into a bubbletea outlet. Said
one consultant to the board, “That
vaguely named F-East outlet in the
JCR is doing really well. Surveys show
that students from the East like food
also from the East, and bubbletea is
apparently a delicacy from out there.”
Another plan is to have a 50m long
jacket potato station, complete with
a salad bar similar to that in the JCR.
A different consultant suggested that
the students could then fill a potato
with their choice of salad, although
this was met with trepidation as some
were keen to point out that students
are not used to such varied filling
choice when it comes to staples such
as the mighty potato.
One warned: “If we start letting
them think you can put more into a
potato than just soggy tuna or plastic
cheese, we may see a culinary uprising
on our hands.”
However, when one board member
suggested the quality of the potato
should also be addressed, they were
met with unfaltering laughter, with
one colleague actually wiping tears
out of his eyes and another rolling on
the floor.
Further blueprints depicted a
series of fountains that would pour
out drinkable aloe vera water that
students could then refill their bottles
from, and another bar dedicated
purely to creating the award winning
chicken and bacon baguette by hand.
There was conflict over the idea to
present facilities for evening meals
however, with one member stating
that “we shouldn’t spoil the students
too much.”
Nane Jeary, who chaired the
meeting, agreed and then added: “I
feel uncomfortable providing more
than one outlet that serves healthly,
hot meals past 5pm.
“However, if we are to add another,
we should really shut it by 7pm so
people working late in the library
are forced to go to Imperial College
Union or h bar.”
Union Overlord (Diago McCalidad)
was also present. New to the role of
Top Guy In Charge of Food, Drinks
Shock election stats:
how big is yours?
Anew study by Imperial College
School of Medicine has found
that the average size of a big
election can very by as much as 2.4
positions from country to country.
Africans tend to have Big Elections
of around 7.8 positions, whereas in
Canada the average is 5.4.
Silippa Phett, an alpha female, told
Hangman that the size of the Big
Election is not important, it’s about
how you use it.
She continued “There’s nothing
more satisfying than a Big Election
hitting all the right places”.
Hangman did ask if performance
is reduced with a smaller Election.
Phett replied, “With a Big Election,
the pressure can be just too high and
the likelihood of a unsatisfying finish
is far greater.
“I much prefer a happy ending when
an Election is involved.”
In other news, a student has fallen
seriously ill campus today. A spy at
the health centre discovered he had
a whopping 50 positions in his Big
Election – all of the ones on offer.
Physicians have repeated their
warnings about the excessive effects
of democracy on the body, as it can
lead to starving the brain of blood.
One doctor said, “We recommend
all students to read the label provided
with Democracy before using it.
“We know that Democracy can
help people to overcome feelings of
inadequacy around their Big Election,
but overdose can have a number
of side effects including mocking,
disappointment, and - as seen in this
tragic case – death.”
Manufacturer ePfizer were
unavailable for comment.
and Bars and a driving force behind
the halls takeover, McCalidad
proposed another Union-ran dining
space be included too.
Plans were drawn up to advertise
it as “The longest bar to also house
several hundred mice.” However,
upon hearing a suggestion from
one consultant that maybe this
outlet could provide more variation
than the undistinguishable meals
currently available at h bar and
FiveSixEight, McCalidad turned red
in the face and cried “¿POR QUÉ?”
He stated that providing meals that
can be prepared without being fried
or defrosted may be “Pushing the
boat out a bit.”
“We have perfected the tried and
tested formula for producing fries
that have an aftertaste of fish, so why
change anything?”
However, one consultant was quick
to point out that with no rent coming
in from this hall, and the ever-rising
price of illegal MSG, refurbishing and
stocking all these facilities may cost
thousands.
Nane Jeary came up with a quick
solution however, and pointed out
that the unspent amenities fund from
this year was still lying around in
her account. “With the money saved,
we could probably even chuck in a
few vending machines, although it
doesn’t really matter if they work.”
