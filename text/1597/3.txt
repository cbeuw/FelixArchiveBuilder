Last week the team from
Imperial College London won
the Bhangra Showdown at
Wembley Arena. The event, which
was in its eighth year, was organised
by seven committee members from
the Imperial Punjabi Society. In
previous years the competition has
been held at the Hammersmith
Apollo, and was being held in North
London for the first time.
Nearly four thousand students
had been expected to attend, who
were treated to some exceptional
performances from eight dance
troupes. Imperial won the event, with
Birmingham following in second and
Brunel finishing in tied third place
with King’s College London.
Profits from the event went towards
three different charities: these
included UK Friends of the Unique
Home (Punjabi), which raises money
to provide homes for abandoned
girls in Punjab, India, Variety: The
Children’s Charity, a UK based
charity that provides funding for
children’s hospitals and youth clubs,
and Medecins Sans Frontieres too.
Aman Dhanwal, co-captain of the
winning Bhangra team, said “We are
incredibly thrilled about our win. The
performance was a culmination of
months of hard work, training and
dedication from the team and we are
so happy our passion came across on
stage. The team became a real family
and deserves every bit of credit for
how much they put in to achieve this,
as captains we cannot thank them
enough. A special mention goes to IC
Punjabi Society who put on a truly
amazing show and made this process
one we will never forget. Lifting the
TBS trophy has been a dream come
true.”

Julian Fellowes, creator of
Downton Abbey, visited Imperial
College on Friday 6th
February for
a tour of research labs and met with
College President, Professor Alice
Gast. Their tour finished with a trip
out on Jezebel, the RCSU’s fire engine
mascot, who appeared in Downton
Abbey last September.
Lord Fellowes and his wife visited
South Kensington last Friday, where
they visited the Royal British Legion
Centre for Blast Injury Studies.
The Centre is run as collaboration
between military and civilian
scientists into the reduction and
treatment of injuries caused by blast
waves, such as those produced by
IEDs or landmines.
As part of the tour, Lord and
Lady Fellowes met with various
Masters and PhD students who are
investigating how the loading and
strains produced by blast waves affect
cells and biological tissue.

the Fellowes for a drive through
Kensington and Hyde Park. Despite
the cold weather, Julian Fellowes
described the ride as “[a] big finish
to the morning – so thrilling. The

that brings out the child in all of us I
think!”

The Animal Protection and
Education Society (APES) ran
a successful talk addressing
animal testing last week, including a
speaker from People for the Ethical
Treatment on Animals (PETA).
The debate, titled “Animal Testing:
Vital or Unnecessary?” was held in
SAF last Tuesday, and featured four
speakers who all had varying stances
on animal testing. The audience was
jam packed with students and staff
alike, all interested to hear the views
of the speakers on animal testing in
science.
The speakers included Maggie
Dallman, the head of the Animal
Welfare and Ethical Review Body
at Imperial College, Dr Julia Baines,
the the UK science advisor for PETA,
Dr Brett Cochrane, the the Head of
Science from the Dr Hadwen Trust;
and Tom Holder, a representative
from Speaking of Research.

Each speaker was given time
to present their arguments, and
then people were able to pose
predetermined questions to the
speakers. People were able to submit
questions before online or to the club
in person beforehand.
The speakers spoke about the
current animal testing methods, the
development of alternative methods.
Maggie Dallman was also asked if
there had been any changes to College
protocol or practice since the British
Union Against Vivisection (BUAV)
“exposed” methods for animal testing
in Imperial labs back in 2012.
Their accusations against Imperial
for malpractice were unfounded.
Dallman answered that basically
nothing had changed, as nothing was
being done incorrectly in the first
place.
Felix spoke to Kayla Chiew, Chair
of APES and Marielle Deconinck,
who is the club’s Secretary. They
started planning the event last term,
and initially wanted a speaker from
BUAV, but found it quite difficult to
organise. However, apart from that,
they were pleased with their event
and how it went.
“We were really nervous at first
about turnout because it was our first
event, but we had 40 people sign up to
come along and were very happy with
the turnout!”

APES is still in its first year,
and this was their first event with
outside speakers. APES currently
has 29 members, and do not have a
definitive view on animal testing, but
are keen to stimulate debate over a
variety of topics concerning animal
welfare.
