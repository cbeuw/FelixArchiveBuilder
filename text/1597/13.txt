and would not be appropriate in the
UK where (alas) we tend not to receive
much direct sunlight, nor would it
be suitable for many countries in
Northern Europe or Canada. On the
other hand, places like the Atacama
desert in Chile, the Southwest USA
as already mentioned, vast swathes
of Africa, parts of China and most
of Australia could be ideal locations
for CPV with their near-constant
supplies of sunlight.
Currently, CPV is only taking baby
steps into the market with analyst
house IHS predicting that only
around 800MWp will be installed in
the US by 2020 compared to around
7,000MWp in China alone if it is to
meet targets set by its 13th Five-Year
Plan. Nevertheless, CPV systems
have huge potential with MJ cells
that have a scarily high theoretical
maximum efficiency of 86%. Already
for CPV, China has comfortably the
largest projects in the world with two
55+MWp plants in Qinghai province
alone.
Solar does Yoga
CPV and c-Si PV are both very flat
and modular. Exploring alternatives,
some of the more creative emerging
technologies, such as Perovskite cells
and organic solar dyes employ more
flexible designs and applications for
solar PV.
Starting with Perovskite, as a
technology which received lots of
initial attention in the ‘90s, interest
in the technology has increased
particularly in the last few years,
with Nature calling Perovskite solar
cell growth ‘one-to-watch’ in 2014.
In part, this interest has come from
a rapid increase in efficiency from
3.8% in 2009 to around 20% now,
coupled with potentially much less
intensive and cheaper manufacturing
processes than c-Si. Although
this efficiency is obviously low
when compared to CPV, studies by
Oxford Energy have suggested that
Perovskite cells could compete with
current Thin-Film technologies
that have comparable efficiencies
of 19-20%. Whilst this is certainly
beneficial to overall competitiveness,
Perovskite’s real trump card comes
in its flexibility of application. With
an emphasis on diversity, Perovskite
cells can be coloured in translucent
glass, integrated into buildings
(so-called Building Integrated PV)
and windows and even used as
cheap lasers according to research
by the University of Cambridge.
In this sense, the PV market has
the potential to be opened up to
whole new sectors including those
that involve aesthetic and stylistic
decisions about materials such as the
construction industry.
Going even further, organic solar
dyes have the potential to be printed
out onto thin polymers producing
reams of solar film at low cost and
low environmental impact. As may
be expected, the efficiencies of these
kinds of films are typically too low
to be competitive with conventional
solar markets. But – and this is
perhaps the whole point of these
technologies – if such innovative
designs can capture the public
imagination, maybe they will not
have to. Already there has been the
controversial project to build ‘solar
roads’ in USA, which some even
(wrongly) thought was a hoax when it
sought crowdfunding. With this new
wave of PV technologies then, there
is genuine intrigue as applications of
the technology are starting to move
well beyond the realms of traditional
power generation.
Future Potential and a Bright
New Dawn
Perhaps the most interesting
aspect of these third generation PV
technologies is that they do not have
many aspects in common. Where
CPV seeks to become the ultra-
efficient successor of c-Si PV in power
generation, Perovskite and organic
solar dyes explore different markets
and designs altogether.
Hopefully this means, if and
when these technologies become
commercialised, they will not have to
compete as each will fill a different
market nichem from industry to
design.
In the meantime, whilst c-Si reigns
supreme, it is difficult to predict
when said commercialisation may
happen. Policy will inevitably play its
part, and indeed these technologies
can take encouragement from the
fact that this was really how the solar
market started in the first place.
Whether these technologies can
take a meaningful slice out of c-Si
market share remains to be seen;
naturally, there is still a long way to
go. But the horizon is starting to look
a whole lot brighter.
