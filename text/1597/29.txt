Some metatheatre most remarkable
Despite reading the synopsis
beforehand, I was entirely
unprepared for Six Characters
in Search of a Story, an intense piece of
metatheatre that turns all convention
on its head. Written in 1921 by Luigi
Pirandello and first performed in
the same year to mixed reviews, I can
only imagine how startling it must
have been for audiences then, given
how radical it still is.
Right from the beginning, it is
clear that we are watching a play
about plays. A costume lady works
away at her sewing machine while a
scenic painter paints the set. Actors
walk around the stage rehearsing
lines and the director storms in,
his instructions brisk. They are
rehearsing for a Pirandello play and
there is an absurdist touch to the way
the actors are made to repeatedly
rehearse a particularly inane scene.
Beneath the playful, self-deprecating
humour, however (“We are reduced
to staging Pirandello!”), there is a
serious question about the point of
theatre and how far removed it is
from reality.
This idea is dramatically expanded
upon the entrance of a group of
six characters who claim they have
been abandoned by their author
and are now seeking an alternative
author to finish their story. Initially
unwelcoming, the director is
increasingly drawn into their tragedy
as they recount a tale of incest and
guilt. He agrees to help them finish
their story, but insists on his own
actors learning their roles in order
to stage it themselves. Disputes soon
arise as the actors re-enact their
story with comical exaggeration,
inadvertently trivialising the raw
guilt and shame of the characters as
the father unwittingly makes love to
his stepdaughter.
But how do the characters
themselves feel genuine emotion, if
they were birthed from an author’s
imagination? Fiction and reality
here is fluid, just as how time can
stall and replay, the passions buried
and resurfaced again and again. The
characters insist that their suffering
is real, and any attempt to replicate it
would be mockery. But is that not all
of theatre – dramatic representations
of real life? Or is it the other way
round, as Shakespeare writes – all the
world’s a stage, and all the men and
women merely players?
The director, who was able to so
precisely control the piece he was
originally staging, realises that
he is rapidly losing control over
the six characters and their story.
His attempts to regain control are
thwarted by their passions which take
increasingly free rein as the story
progresses.
There is also a question of
determinism here; if the characters’
stories are unfinished, how do they
know what exactly should happen
next? Have their fates been sealed
from the start? The director and
actors can only look on in horror as
the characters march unstoppable

Jingjie Cheng finds this 1920s play as relevant as ever
Singing Stones – the Women’s Spring
JOSHUA JACOB
ARTS WRITER
"The script
is infused
with
powerful
imagery and
enthralling
poetry."
"The play
lucidly
shows us the
plight of
women and
children in
the Arab
Spring."
The Singing Stones is a new
play that explores the role of
women in the Arab Spring. On
the stage, as the audience are finding
their seats, a young woman is sitting
before a backdrop of rubble and
broken furniture, on an otherwise
bare stage. She is smiling contentedly
whilst playing with some scraps of
cloth, and needle and thread. How
can I begin to understand this image
in front of me, and the world it’s
associated with: the world of Alia
Alzougbi, of countless children, with
countless mothers and fathers, a
world of revolution and conflict. A
distant land to which I am a voyeur,
following it’s ebb and flow through
international news. Kay Adshead –
the writer and director of this first
staging of the play – has found a way.
The audience’s apathy is
undermined throughout the show.
At the start of the play Alia Alzougbi,
who reminds me of a lonely child,
isolated but for the phantoms of
her imagination, verbalises her
disillusionment with her country’s
ruling class through puppetry. She
engages the audience with humour,
but underlying her jokes there is a
desperate young lady vying for our
attention and trying to find a voice.
The play offers anecdotes of the
Arab Spring in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya
and Syria, as well as Camberwell
in South London. In every scene
the women are railing against the
denial of their freedom of speech
and their incapacity to make change
in the Arab world. The words of
the characters on stage describe the
brutality that the protesters were
subjected to, the repugnant designs
of dictators, the victimisation of
children in war, and how the women
in the Arab Spring dealt with these
issues.
The acting was sometimes
unconvincing, but otherwise
fulfilled its function, and at points
Alia Alzougbi was exceptional. The
simplicity of the set worked well, as
it didn’t distract the audience, while
the size of the theatre allowed for an
intimate viewing experience.
The script is infused with powerful
imagery and mesmerising poetry,
which leaves no question of the
playwright’s artistic understanding
of the play’s deeply political subject.
Feminist issues are intrinsic to the
play, but do not distract from the
stories themselves. It seems that the
author is challenging not only the
inequality of power between men
and women, but also the inequality
between women in the Western
and Arab worlds. The play doesn’t
aggressively argue a political point,
but instead lucidly shows us the
plight of women and children in the
Arab Spring, and in its penultimate
scene conscientiously dissects
the difficulties of respectfully
communicating this bloody conflict
on the stage.
The Singing Stones is being performed
at the Arcola Theatre until the 28th
of
February.
Also, the Theatre is working towards
being the first carbon neutral theatre
in the world. So when you see the
production and find your conscience
being challenged, at least you won’t need
to worry so much about how far the polar
ice caps have receded in the process.
towards their inevitable tragic
ends. The scenes are appropriately
accompanied by eerie, bone-chilling
music that sets the surreal feel of the
whole play.
Originally written in Italian, this
production was in French with
English subtitles. The cast delivers an
electrifying performance, and there
is clever use of the stage and sets. A
makeshift stage is wheeled on and we
observe the very process of adapting
‘reality’ for stage – the physical
representation of the metatheatre it
is.
Shadows are used to great effect,
representing the almost mythical
character of Madam Pace, who forced
the stepdaughter into prostitution,
as well as the burden of the tragedy
on each forlorn character at the end
of the play. A section of the stage juts
out into the audience, and it is here
that the director sits as he watches the
characters take their story into their
own hands further upstage, joining
the audience as a spectator himself.
Director Emmanuel Demarcy-
Mota’s production is remarkably
faithful to the text, but at the same
time it takes advantage of modern
staging techniques that make the
experience an immersive one. No
doubt the story is bizarre, yet the
questions it raises are as relevant to
theatre today as they ever were.
