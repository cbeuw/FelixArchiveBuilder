Union Council votes in favour of new rent proposals
Students present at Union Council
this week voted in favour of new
rent proposals, which included
lowering the suggested rates for the
new student accommodation based
in Acton.
The new hall, now named
Woodward, will open next academic
year; students will face a commute
time upwards of thirty minutes to get
to campus.
Students sitting on Council were
asked to choose between three
different proposals for future rent
prices of all student halls, with
one being the rent prices that are
currently in place as suggested by
College.
All proposals had to ensure that
the average rent for a room across
all halls is £166 a week for a 39-week
contract, but two out of the three
reflected a higher price in halls closer
to campus to average out a lower price
for rooms in Woodward.
College had previously suggested
that hall prices in Acton would
average £158 a week, but after
discussions between Imperial College
Union President Tom Wheeler and
Muir Sanderson, the Chief Financial
Officer of College, it was suggested
by Imperial College Union that the
cost be brought down to an average of
around £120 instead.
This does not include the travel
costs students will have to cover to
get to and from the South Kensington
campus.
However, for this average to come
down to £120, other halls nearer to
campus would have to see a rent hike
as a result. This included increasing
the average rent of a hall in Eastside
to £215 from £191, and for Southside,
increasing it from £174 to £200.
Wilson will see a slight decrease from
£153 to £150 a week on average.
A union spokesperson
was keen to
highlight that
this does mean
there will be
more affordable
accommodation
across the entire
portfolio –
although, since the
average price of rent
on the whole doesn’t
change from £166,
it won’t mean that
accommodation has
got any cheaper in
general.
Wheeler also pointed
that these are just
averages, and there are
still major discrepancies
between room prices even within
the same hall. Some halls contain up
to four price brackets, making hall
pricing a complex topic.
He also pointed out that there
is a preference for cheaper
accommodation in general, but due
to the nature of South Kensington,
reducing the prices of halls near
campus is difficult.
Debra Humphris, the Vice Provost
(Education) was present at the
meeting, and was keen to stress the
College’s commitment to “increasing
transparency” when it comes to hall
prices. Humphris commissioned
the Residential Experience Review
back in 2013, to investigate the
quality of accommodation, and how
accommodation can be improved.
She also warned however that there
are no straightforward and easy
Union Council condemns Counter-Terrorism Bill
Also at Council this week was a
motion against the Counter
Terrorism and Security Bill
(CTSB), which is currently concluding
its passage through the Houses of
Parliament.
The paper, submitted by Jawaad
Farooq and seconded by Nida
Mahmud and Shamim Ahmed,
argues that the bill “discourages
the free expression and analysis of
ideas.” They note that, were the bill
to pass, the Union would lose the
ability to control what events it does
and does not allow to happen on
campus – currently both the Union
and College can veto speakers at an
event before the room is booked.
College Chairman, Baroness Eliza
Manningham-Buller has previously
condemned the bill in the House of
Lords.
Concern was raised over whether
the Union is actually able to do
anything over the bill, as it will
shortly receive Royal Ascent. When
the bill’s provisions become statutory,
both College and the Union would
be in breach of the law if they chose
to ignore it. The paper’s supporters,
however, argued that it doesn’t stop
the Union from campaigning against
the bill.
They continued, saying that they
didn’t want to remove all measures
to prevent controversial speakers
from speaking at universities –
highlighting the Union’s existing
“rigorous” checking procedures – the
feeling was that banning everyone
was not ideal as universities are a
forum for debate. Tom Wheeler,
Union President, said sources in
College felt it was a “hostile takeover
of the university sector by the
government”.
The bill itself is designed to impose
a number of restrictions on people
or organisations suspected to be
affiliated with terrorism. The first
part of the bill allows the Home
Secretary to remove passports from

people who have travelled overseas
to fight for terrorist organisations,
whereas the third part forces internet
service providers to store data to
allow the authorities to identify a
person by their IP address.
The PREVENT strategy, introduced
in 2003, which will become statutory
as part of the bill, aims to prevent
radicalisation of potential terrorists.
It is comprised of three sections
aiming to challenge “the ideology
that supports terrorism and those
who promote it”, protect “vulnerable
people”, and support “sectors and
institutions where there are risks
of radicalisation”. It is in this third
category that universities fall.
However, there have been
complaints about the perceived
targeting of Muslims and Muslim
organisations in projects associated
with PREVENT, while others have
criticised installation of “covert”
CCTV in Muslim communities in
Birmingham.
Overall, the paper passed by a
margin of 26-3 after a number
of minor modifications. Despite
the recent passing of a policy to
publically list the voting record of
Council members, Abigail de Bruin
supported a move to keep the voting
record as private to reduce the chance
of members experiencing what she
called a “personal attack” as a result of
their vote.
answers when it comes to balancing
rent and hall provisions: “We can’t
give you cheap [rooms] and also give
you Eastside.”
According to Wheeler, College
currently has no data that shows
whether students would prefer to live
close to campus or pay less and live
further away.
The Residential Experience Review,
run by College at the end of 2013, did
investigate whether students would
like to pay less for rent or live closer,
but as separate issues. Unsurprisingly,
students answered that they would
like to have both options, but there
was no way to cast a preference
between the two.
The paper covered a number of
topics concerning rent prices and hall
usage. It also included a breakdown of
rent, showing the costs for cleaning,
maintenance, facilities management,
and wardening.
It was also hinted by Humphris
that there may one day be halls at
Imperial West too, although it is “still
early days”. Imperial West is the new
campus based near White City, which
is still under development. It will
house new chemistry facilities.
Humphris stressed that they are
committed to ensuring all first year
students have the opportunity to live
in halls. “If we are to achieve our first
year guarantee, we need clear plans.
“It is still early days but we need to
re-evaluate our portfolio. There is a
large residential tower [at Imperial
West] there, and that could also be
used for accommodation for our
staff.”
Wheeler said to Felix after
the meeting: “It is fantastic that
as a result of our lobbying and
campaigning we have secured lower
rent for over 1,000 future students
with the new approach to College
accommodation.
“It is indicative of the improved
relationship that we now have with
College that we are being given these
figures, let alone that we are engaging
on these difficult decisions.”
