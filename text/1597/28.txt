London’s best small theatres - Part II
Max Falkenburg returns for the second part of his theatre guide
Battersea Arts Centre
There’s something wrong with the
Battersea Arts Centre.Although
the management would have you
believe its decrepit shell is from
a beautiful Grade II listed former
town hall,its insides leave a lot to
be desired.
However,what it lacks in a
permanent purpose built modern
stage,is made up for by the
incredible versatility of the spaces
so many other venues could only
dream of.
The BAC’s direction and creative
edge is at the forefront of British
theatre.Under the leadership of
David Jubb,the theatre emphasises
the spirit of radicalism and has
supported a number of key
contemporary artists in recent years,
making it where to go to for the best
in experimental theatre.
Next: Missing,by the Gecko Company

-21st
March
Although it’s not really my sort of
thing,the Gecko company are the
people to see for physical dance
theatre.A journey into the depths
of the human psyche,Missing will
likely be just as nuts as what you’d
usually expect from the BAC.

Seriously,if you really have

the Tricycle will almost always
impress,regardless of the show.
