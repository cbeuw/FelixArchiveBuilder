The elections are open to all students, Undergraduates and Postgraduates alike. You can nominate
yourself for one or more of the positions available during our Nominations period 2 February -
1 March.
You might have a few queries or worries about taking part in our elections. Are you an International
student and not sure if you can run because of your visa? Not sure if you can do it because you’re a
Postgradutate student? Worried you don’t have enough experience? Don’t worry - it’s no problem for
you to stand in our election. We’re running a number of information sessions before and during the
Nomination period so that you can learn more about making the most of your campaign.
You can also watch students like you who ran for election last year tell thier story of what it’s really
like to run for a position and what to expect from the role.

Student Volunteering Week is
almost here! During the last week
of February, we will be giving you
the chance to see what you can
gain and the difference you can
make through volunteering. From
inspiring school pupils on a trip
to Imperial, to helping feed the
homeless with Souprun, or trying
out micro-volunteering - there’s
something for everyone, and
something to suit even the
busiest schedules.
