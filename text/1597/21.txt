Mental illnesses, visualised
One of the most enduring issues
about mental illnesses is
getting people to understand
them. Sure, everyone has heard about
it from the media, but what they’re
associated with is far from accurate.
Violence and mental illness are rarely
correlated, and it only appears that
way because of the news whenever
exceptional cases occur.
In actual fact, mental illnesses only
affect the way you look at the world,
how it appears and what you feel
you should do. It might be dark and
meaningless, chaotic and fragile or
so nonsensical that you can’t seem
to fit in. It may come in episodes,
crippling the sufferer like migraines,
or it can tint everything they do and
see, becoming integrated as a part of
their lives.
As this is a matter of perspective,
mental illnesses are hard to
understand, which makes it seem
scary and volatile. We, the welfare
section editors, have taken a stab
at explaining what mental illnesses
are like last term, but for something
so personal, perhaps art will speak
louder than words.
So this week, here are some
webcomics and illustrations of what
mental illnesses are like. They aren’t
horror stories, more like heartfelt
attempts to capture the strange
indescribable feelings that come with
mental illnesses. Sufferers would feel
that they’re understood, and friends
of sufferers would better understand
the people they’re supporting.
Hyperbole and a Half
Starting off light with perhaps the
most popular comic on depression,
Allie Brosh managed to turn
her unique humour on her own
experience with depression in
‘Adventures in Depression’ or
‘Depression Part Two’.
If any of you have read hyperbole
and a half before, you’d be familiar
with the weird and manic way her
brain works. She used this very same
brain to give a very personal analysis
of her own depression.
Funny at times, Brosh vividly
portrays the escalation of depression,
complete with the sense of
hopelessness, crippling exhaustion
and self-hatred. But most uniquely,
she showed how an episode of
depression can be lifted by the most
unlikely situations and in the least
Hollywood-like kind of way. This
reminder can come as a relief to
people who thought that depression
should be beaten in the most
conclusive way possible.
Depression comix
In this series of webcomics, the
author known only as Clay gives
a more somber representation
of depression. Updated weekly,
depression comix deals with the daily
struggles of depression sufferers and
those they care about. The style is
completely in black and white, drawn
with heavy lines and a lot of shading.
What strikes me the most about
this webcomic is how many scenarios
it presents. It doesn’t just go into
the head of sufferers, it also looks
at the perspectives of their friends
and partners across a wide range of
relationships, often being awfully
frank about how they feel.
The honesty makes some of the
scenarios hit hard, especially when
it comes to how depression hurts
those you love more than it hurts
you. These can be cautionary tales
so sufferers and their friends can be
more aware in the future.
Better, drawn
The name of this series of comics
comes from the phrase “sometimes
things can be said better when they’re
drawn”. This is a collection of comics
by various artists who suffer from
long-term mental and physical
illnesses, including anxiety, obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), eating
disorder and even post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD).
The best thing about this collection
is just the sheer variety from so
many perspectives. Some have
positive outlooks and effective
coping mechanisms, others are more
negative.
It brings home the fact that there
are a whole lot of people out there
suffering from mental illnesses
and that people cope with them
in different ways. This sense of
Clay’s depression comix goes for uncomfortably relatable feelings. Image:

sufferers can feel some company
through the isolating experience.
Real Monsters
This isn’t a comic but it’s so
interesting I have to include it to
the list. The artist, Toby Allen,
imagined mental illnesses to be
caused by different types of mythical
spirits.They would lurk around,
find a victim and then prey on their
insecurities, feeding off those terrible
feelings.
Their designs reflect what these
mental illnesses mean to the artist,
like how social anxiety monster hides
behind an immense shell.
According to Allen, “The artwork
is not at all intended to make light
of these conditions but instead is
intended to give these intangible
mental illnesses some substance and
make them appear more managable
as physical entities.”
