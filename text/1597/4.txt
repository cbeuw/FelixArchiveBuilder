Philippa Skett reports on this year’s charity extravaganza, which included
walking on fire, jumping from cranes and tunnelling.
Imperial bungee jumps into RAG week
This week saw two days of
bungee jumping, one evening
of fire walking, a lunchtime of
pancake-tossing and just under 900
doughnuts; all in the name of Raising
And Giving (RAG).
RAG Week 2015 has seemingly
taken over campus, with students
unable to go anywhere without the
shocking pink and custard yellow
RAG logo leaping out from screens,
signs, buckets, banners and hoodies.
The week was organised by the RAG
committee and other volunteers;
over 30 students in total have come
together to run the events throughout
the week to raise money for three
chosen charities.
On Monday and Tuesday, a
large crane loomed precariously
close to Queen’s Tower, for the
bungee-jumping pleasure of falling
enthusiasts and onlookers. Students
were able to purchase a ticket for
£35, and were then required to raise
a further £40 in sponsorship before
throwing themselves from the crane
parked between Queen’s Lawn and
the Sherfield Building.
Over 140 students and staff took
part in the bungee jump, including
some visiting from other London
universities. George Butcher, a fourth
year Mechanical Engineering student,
told Felix afterwards how despite
being a bit wary of heights, he was
keen to give it a go.
“I’ve never plummeted towards
the Earth before, but after trying it,
would be keen to do it again. Sorry
to everyone who heard me shout
profanities across Queen’s Lawn as I
fell!”
The RAG Week Launch also took
place during Monday lunchtime,
which saw the RAG Chair and also
Alice Gast give speeches about RAG
and plans for the week.
Alice Gast said afterwards to Felix:
“It’s been wonderful to see students
and staff from across the College
community come together to support
RAG.
“I’ve been very impressed by all
those who’ve given their time and
energy to raise money for good causes,
particularly the RAG committee
volunteers who’ve pulled together the
week’s events.”
Senior College staff came together
to make pancakes for students, whilst
the Royal College of Science Union
(RCSU) lent out their own candyfloss
machine to RAG to produce yellow
and pink candyfloss for students
watching the bungee jump.
College staff have also been seen
sporting custom made RAG hoodies
around campus this week, with Vice
Provost (Education) Debra Humphris
sporting her bright pink number
when she attended Union Council on
Tuesday.
In fact, staff involvement with
RAG seems to have reached an all
time high this year; Professor Tom
Welton, Dean of Faculty of Natural
Sciences, was seen walking over hot
coals for charity on Thursday evening
too, raising £160 in the process.
The Firewalk, where participants
walked across burning hot coals
barefoot, is a new edition to RAG
week, but proved popular. The
coals, as the supervisor explained,
was heated to around 600 degrees
Fahrenheit (around 315 Celsius) –
this being “twice” the temperature
that skin melts at.
All participants were awarded a
certificate for their efforts, and got
to cross the coals twice following a
brief information session. The Dean
of the Faculty of Natural Sciences,
Tom Welton, said, “I was amazed,
it was more painful standing on the
cold stone than walking across the hot
coals.”
He continued, “I’d do it again –
I’m glad I did it first and not last –
standing in the queue and watching
people do it would have.” When asked
if he had any comments on RAG this
year, he concluded, “RAG is fab, it’s
great that it raises a lot of money, but
the really important thing about it is
people take the opportunity to think
about other people”.
Tunnel tours under the campus and
trips up the Queen’s Tower also were
organised and ran by RAG.
Students could explore the disused
tunnels that snake underneath
campus and stretch to South
Kensington and beyond, or, if they
prefer heights but didn’t fancy the
bungee jump, could head to the top of
Queen’s Tower instead.
On Thursday evening, RAG also
ran their traditional Masquerade
Valentines Ball, with a £4,000 bar
tab. The Ball was held in Under the
Bridge, a club in Fulham, which, as
the name suggests, is indeed under a
bridge.
Other clubs and societies have
also got involved in raising money;
the Science Fiction and Fantasy
Society held a book sale with all
proceeds being donated to RAG,
the IC Dodgeball team ran a charity
tournament, and many clubs also
posed naked for the RAG charity
calendar. Various departments have
also run bake sales, with the proceeds
going to RAG too.
Imperial RAG joined forces with
the Royal College of Music (RCM),
whose RAG Week coincided with
Imperial’s. The RCM hosted a poker
night, which raised several hundred
pounds, and saw students from both
colleges playing late into the night.
The Oxford RAG society has also
teamed with Imperial RAG for
the Megaraid this weekend, with
students travelling up to Oxford to
raise money there.
Felix spoke to Arran Sayers, the
RAG Vice Chair (Operations) and the
RAG Champion for CGCU, about
how the team had come together and
made the week possible.
“Everyone has put their heart and
soul into helping out this week.
“The Week has been a great success.
I’m extremely happy with all that has
happened and all the money that has
been raised.”
Sayers is also shaving his head at
the end of the week for Alzheimer’s
Society, after his grandmother sadly
died due to the disease.
Sayers is planning to shave his hair
on Queen’s Lawn during lunchtime,
although he is quite nervous about
it. “I’m worried I’m going to look a
