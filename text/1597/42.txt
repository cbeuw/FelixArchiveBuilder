ArtsFest to hit Imperial next week

“ArtsFest? What’s that?” I
hear you chorus, “There
are scientists, engineers
and medics at Imperial who like arts?”
I may be totally biased, but I really
believe the answer is yes, and ArtsFest
is one of the many times during the
year to show it.
The successes of Arts clubs at
Imperial are far reaching. A few years
ago, in a competition that only ran
once, Imperial College Symphony
Orchestra (ICSO) was awarded the
title of “Best University Orchestra in
the UK”. That’s quite an achievement
against universities in which most
orchestras have at least some music
students!
Just a couple of weeks ago, the
International Championships of
Collegiate A Cappella came to the UK
for the first time and held their semi-
final at Imperial. With more teams
competing than any other University,
and an award for best soloist, the
event was a sure sign of Imperial’s
talents.
We have five orchestras, one
of the best university cinemas in
the country, fantastic choirs and
ambitious art and dance groups. Each
one has a number of fantastic events
coming up for you this term – such
as more ambitious shows than ever
before in the recently redeveloped
Union Concert Hall, ICSO
performing at Cadogan Hall, home
of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,
and the IC Choir performing Carmina
Burana in the Great Hall. And on
top of all this, they all take part in
ArtsFest!
ArtsFest is a weeklong celebration
of Art, Drama, Music, Dance and
everything in between that Imperial
has to offer. This year it takes place
from 16th
–20th
February and has
more events and more collaborations
than ever before. And crucially, every
single event is free.
There are events every evening.
Some highlights include Imperial
College Sinfonietta on Monday 16th
performing the music to Fantasia
live in the Union Concert Hall, in
collaboration with Imperial Cinema,
FilmSoc and ICTV. On Wednesday
18th
there’s another chance to hear
our A Cappella groups, this time
performing a variety of pieces with
the fantastic Musical Theatre Society
in the Union Concert Hall – surely
not to be missed!
If Jazz and Rock are more your
thing, then don’t miss the Tribute
Night on Thursday 19th
in Metric,
or Big Band playing up the Queen’s
Tower on Monday lunchtime (I’m
praying for good weather...). Or
maybe it’s Dance? On Friday 20th
, our
ArtsFest spectacular finale will take
place in the Union Concert Hall with
a variety of performances from Dance
societies such as Funkology, Latin
and Belly Dancing, musical societies,
international societies such as
ChineseSoc, all hosted by ComedySoc.
“I have too much work, I can’t
come”, you say. Well firstly these
events are all free. Almost all of these
societies would (rightly!) normally
charge for tickets, so it’s an amazing
opportunity open to everyone. Two
societies will also be holding “Concert
Teasers” for you: the IC Choir on
Thursday lunchtime in Sherfield,
and ICSO’s Open Rehearsal in the
Great Hall on Wednesday evening – a
concert which will eventually feature
the BBC Young Musician 2014 on the
28th
February!
There are also events at lunch-time

Like Le Mans, but on eight wheels
Lizzie Campbell at the Skate Society’s first speed skating session
It was an inauspicious start to last
year’s Le Mans 24 hour roller
relay. One seventh of the team
had missed the train and there had
been one injury before the race had
even started; our team shirts were
homemade with sharpies on the
Eurostar and the rain was practically
biblical.
Nonetheless, we soldiered on and
managed to steal away first prize in
the student category. One golden cup,
a bottle of champagne and enough
time for the muscle spasms to subside
later, we decided to go again, except
this time bigger and better!
This year, ten members of IC Skate
Soc are undertaking one of the world’s
most challenging skate races.
This is where Adrian Wordsworth
comes in. Adrian has been skating
since he was a toddler and has gone
on to win 21 British speed skating
titles. He has been a fixture on the UK
skating scene for decades.
Our captain and Chair last year,
Jenny Lenz, met Adrian last year at
Le Mans and Adrian has generously
offered to train our team this year.
His company Troup Bywaters +
Anders will also sponsor us for some
real shirts this year! Thanks to this
generosity we plan to steal back the
Cup of Glory from our rivals at other
Universities worldwide.
This Wednesday was our first
training session. Though bitterly cold,
the sun was shining and we headed
down to Serpentine road in Hyde
Park. Setting out a small circuit, we
began with the basics and learned the
stance preferred by speed skaters…
getting really, really low! After two
minutes skating in this position, our
thighs were on fire and our lower
backs were starting to complain.
The paceline (a technique where a
long line of skaters all skate in perfect
unison, so that wind resistance is
reduced for everyone except the poor
leader) was equally difficult, with
everyone bumping into each other
and falling behind in turns. How on
Earth were we going to take on this
mammoth race?!
And yet, within half an hour we
were getting it, and skating with
perfect form around our circuit. We
learned about planning lines around
corners, about passing batons without
decelerating (scary!) and much more.
Within 2 hours we were all hooked,
and excited for the next training
session!
By the time Le Mans rolls around in
June, we’re hoping to be a well-oiled
skating machine – in no small part
thanks to Adrian’s expert training. If
you’re interested in learning to skate,
or in joining the speed skating team,
IC SkateSoc meet every Wednesday at
13:00 in Beit Quad, and can provide
skates and pads.
Speed Skate training is the first
week of every month at the same
time as usual skate sessions. We can
