Imperial leave it late to snatch victory against Hult
Last Saturday IC 7s faced off
against Hult International
Business School 2s in Victoria
Park. The day got off to a bad start
when Giles Wane decided he would
miss the meeting time altogether
after his alarm just decided it would
not go off that morning. The tube
journey to Victoria Park took us past
all of the great sights of London,
including Whitechapel, a place
where one of the team feels more
comfortable and cosy than anywhere
else in London.
Upon arrival in Victoria Park it
was clear that this was not going to be
90 minutes of footballing delight. In
fact it wasn’t going to be 90 minutes
of anything, but more on that later.
While the changing rooms were of
a more spacious variety than those
at Fortress H, many rogue items
were found on the floor and this
encouraged a quick change allowing
for more warm up time once on
the pitch. However, a quick pitch
inspection showed the conditions
to be even worse than expected –
the Shaguar has since considered
buying the plot of land we played on
to grow his potatoes, describing the
conditions as “perfect”.
It was even discussed if goals had
to be converted using the Klinsmann
method, which was turned down
by the opposition, something that
became more and more surprising
during the game as it was evident
that they all enjoyed a good dive. The
referee then decided at 2pm that kick
off had actually been scheduled at
1:30pm instead and tried to tell us
both teams had shown up late. After
much discussion it was decided that
35 minute halves would be played.
Hults were given kick-off as the ref
had forgotten the coin for the toss
in his bag which was unfortunately
placed 20m away on the touchline.
As the game kicked off it was
apparent that the midfield duo
of Sam Monk and Euan Graham
was ideally suited for this style of
football with their destructive ability,
conquering the middle of the park
early. Rob Harris played his usual
style with minimal running but great
efficiency in laying off the ball to his
supporting cast of Ignacio Deprit,
Tom Fenning and Chris Caulcrick.
This created opportunities early but
Harris missed a one on one and Chris
fired a free kick just over the bar.
Hults were convinced that playing
Immortals lose at home
to Hurricanes 24-6
Sunday 8th
February saw the
Imperial Immortals clash with
the Hertfordshire Hurricanes at
Fortress Harlington.
Earlier in the season the
Immortals put in a great second
half and lost 22-12 after some
inspired work from Bob WorksF
romHomeAlone2:LostInNewYo
rk with the quarterback sneak of
legend.
Sunday’s game started with the
Immortals offence on the pitch
after a minute’s silence of respect
for Tony Bainbridge,former head
coach of Brighton Tsunami,who
died earlier in the week.
The offence started strong;
driving the ball early on,which
wouldbecomeathemethroughout
the game.Strong running from
Emanuel Olagbaju and Duncan
‘Wendy’MacKinnon saw yards for
days but as with previous games
the offence struggled to finish and
put the ball in the endzone.
Immortals defense were strong
as ever and limited the normally
high scoring Herts offence to only
one touchdown in the first half,
which ended with Amit Chawla
getting a tasty interception.
The second half saw the
Herts offence put up two more
touchdowns and a field goal to
put them up by 24-0.However,
the Immortals stuck to what they
knew by running the ball hard and
throwing well.
Toby Sinclair,quarterback,threw
for over 100 yards on the day
including some great link-up play
between Toby and Noach Ben-
Haim with special mention for the
always illusive yards-after-catch
Noach managed to pick up,saw the
Immortals fly down the pitch.
This megadrive saw the
Immortals within 10 yards of
the Herts endzone where the
offence punched the ball in with
a quarterback sneak with Toby
waltzing in for the touchdown.
The defense managed to win
the ball back for the offence
several times through the efforts
of Marin‘wet burp’Tuleu getting
two interceptions on the day as
well as Little Harry Collini causing
a fumble.
However,the Herts defense
stayed strong to deny the
Immortals any more points and
the game finished 24-6 to Herts.
The Game’s Most Valuable
Players were: Little Harry‘Springer’
Collini (Line MVP for great work on
the offensive and defensive lines),
Marin‘wet burp’Tuleu (Defensive
MVP for consistent play of defense
and getting two picks),Noach Ben-
Haim (Offensive MVP for great
play on the outside to keep the
drive alive several times with his
magic feet) and Jörn‘Gorab’Jörg
(Overall MVP for dominating on
both offensive and defensive lines
and making the QB sneak a real
weapon).
Special mention has to go to
Mad Dog Pecs who it was nice to
see back playing the game with
some of his mind intact.A great
performance with an unflattering
score line helping the Immortals to
look forward to next week’s game
against the Birmingham Lions.

on the ground through the pool of
mud that was the pitch was their
best option, and this made it easy for
the IC defence to stop their attacks.
Throughout the game their only
opportunities arose from set pieces –
but man of the match Jaime was able
to pull off some exceptional saves in
goal.
During the second half IC were
really able to show their dominance
and the breakthrough came in the
67th minute (three minutes from the
end) when their keeper decided to
take a leisurely country stroll back
into his net after punting the ball
15 metres downfield. The ball was
poked through to Chris who did well
to score into the open goal on a pitch
as unstable as Frank’s hands after a
union night.
The day concluded with Louis
offering the best treats of the season
as he ensured that everyone received
not only a starter but also a main
and a dessert. Upon returning to the
union the 7s also decided to dominate
Bola Bola with two semi-finalists,
kicking out many favourites on the
way #justice. Overall, all the players
who had invested into the 7s were
rewarded with an exceptional return.
