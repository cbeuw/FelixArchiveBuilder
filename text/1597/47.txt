If there is one thing that can be
said about the ICC Cricket World
Cup, it’s that over the years, the
International Cricket Council (ICC)
themselves have been very unsure
over what the best format is.
A large amount of this has been
down to the debate over how many
teams there should be in the World
Cup. The governing body is keen
to downsize, whereas the Associate
nations are, predictably, not.
The format has varied widely over
the various editions of the World
Cup, with varying degrees of success.
The original format of the World
Cup, which pitted eight teams in
two groups of four with the top two
progressing to the semi-finals, was
viewed as successful. It lasted just over
a fortnight. However, this format is
not viable now, as there are more than
eight Test nations.
The format of the 1992 World
Cup has been widely accepted as
very successful (even if the rules
weren’t – the rain rule proved to be
very controversial). It had nine teams
who all played each other in a league.
Semi-finals and a final would follow.
This is the sort of format that the
ICC wants to implement, but it has its
drawbacks – the obvious one being
that it would result in the removal of
the Associate nations from cricket’s
premier tournament.
The Associate nations view their
participation in these tournaments
to be crucial for their boards to thrive
financially. A knock-on effect of
boards earning less money is that
grass roots cricket in the countries
will suffer. And we all want younger
players to be playing cricket.
So, based on the assumption that
keeping the Associate Nations is a
good thing, what other formats would
be better? Personally, I quite liked the
2003 format (which had two groups of
seven and a second group stage called
the Super Sixes), but I understand
where people are coming from when
they say that it felt quite long and
bloated.
The ICC responded with the 2007
World Cup, but that proved to be a
financial disaster. In the 2007 World
Cup, the teams were split into four
groups of four, with the top two
from each progressing to a Super
Eights stage. But what the ICC hadn’t
considered were the ramifications
of the big commercial teams being
knocked out.
Whilst I appreciate that this is a
risk no matter what the format, it
is far more likely in a group of four
than a group of seven. India lost to
Bangladesh, and Pakistan lost to
Ireland. Both were knocked out, and
the public had to deal with two weeks
of watching (with all due respect) two
minnows in the Super Eight stage.
Unsurprisingly, ticket sales slumped.
The format for 2011 (and 2015)
sees two groups of seven again, but
with the ill-fated super stages axed
once and for all. Instead there are
quarter-finals before the traditional
semi-finals and final. Again, I have to
say that I quite like the format. Again,
I also have to say that others find it
very long.
So, what is the best format? Well,
in my point of view, the ICC should
take a leaf out of their book for the
Twenty:20 World Cup. In that, there
are sixteen teams – the ten Test
nations and six Associate nations.
The bottom ranked eight teams
have a preliminary stage with the
top two sides qualifying for the
Super Tens, which is effectively the
remaining ten teams playing in two
groups of five.
If the preliminary stage was to be
a knockout tournament then the
length of the overall tournament will
be significantly shorter, while the
Associate nations will also get their
day in the sun.
And most importantly, instead of
arguing, we can all just get on with the
cricket.
What is the best format?
The ICC has been searching for the perfect
World Cup format for years.

Australia v England
Melbourne Cricket Ground,
14th
February
The first game in Australia in
the tournament is one of the
biggest there can be.Both sides
will be looking to make an early
statement to their group about
what to expect.
India v Pakistan
Adelaide Oval,
15th
February
The opening weekend ends with
the biggest clash of them all.India
haven’t lost to Pakistan in a World
Cup before,but Pakistan will know
that India have never looked so
vulnerable going into a World Cup.
India v South Africa
Melbourne Cricket Ground,
22th
February
The two most explosive batting
line-ups from the past year face off
in the crunch match in Pool B.Expect
fireworks from both sides in what
tournament seeds predict will be the
battle for pole position.
New Zealand v Australia
Eden Park,
28th
February
The two hosts play each other on
New Zealand’s home turf.The
Kiwis have been in a rich vein of
form and have looked invincible at
home recently.But Australia is also
looking incredibly strong.It takes a
brave person to suggest this isn’t a
potential prequel to the final.
