"Little
Light is an
emotionally
tense
and well
thought out
journey."
There’s something very familiar
about watching siblings argue.
Whether you’re brother or
sister, older or younger, at some point
in your relationship a certain degree
of sibling rivalry seems inevitable. So,
for a change, it was rather refreshing
to see Little Light open on what felt
like a reasonably normal concept: two
sisters, seeing each other once a year
to tell little bits about their little lives,
and occasionally losing it.
That doesn’t mean Little Light
started as a particularly exciting play.
Set on the seaside away from the
peering eyes of neighbours, Alison
and her husband Teddy live in a
somewhat muted, dysfunctional state.
An argument about Teddy having
ripped out the stairs to replace them
with a ladder dominates the first few
minutes of the play. There is a clear,
loving relationship on show, but
something’s missing in their lives.
Teddy recalls the conversations he’s
had with Alison, their trip to Venice,
and the travesty of Teddy not having
cooked the lamb for lunch. Alison
insists that he’s making most of it up;
she’s controlling and particular, but
otherwise unremarkable.
The auditorium is intimate and
quiet. Set in the round, it feels very
much like the dining room the play
is set in, but there is a distinctly
unsettling feeling going around. It’s
all a bit slow to get going, and while
that can sometimes be used to a
show’s advantage, it does feel a little
too dragged out on this occasion.
With the entry of Clarissa, Alison’s
sister, the play seems to find some
energy. Played by Yolanda Kettle,
there’s a certain charisma in her
performance which draws the
audience in. Pregnant, and covered
in mud from running through the
rain, Clarissa’s arrival sparks Alison
into life. Although the casting
leaves their relationship a little
unclear, their initial discussion has
all the hallmarks of a frayed sibling
relationship. Anger at having arrived
early and furious that Clarissa has
brought her uninvited boyfriend,
Alison’s behaviour becomes
increasingly irrational. With an
insistence on tradition and complete
control over her husband and sister,
the play finally gives us a clue as to
what’s going on:
“I wanted to ask you if this year
could be different.”
Although it was the first play Alison
Birch wrote, this is her fourth major
production. With its clear emphasis
on family and tradition, Birch places
a distinct importance on secrets.
Simon, Clarissa’s boyfriend arrives,
many years her senior but with a
degree of denial about the difficulties
of handling family conflict. Alison’s
furious, and Simon is clearly unaware
of the unspoken traditions of this
yearly meeting. As the play develops,
his relationship with his pregnant
wife and Alison’s need for control
build into a state of extreme tension.
Although little happens for the first
three quarters of the play, the power
behind the language and the emotion
grows spectacularly. What felt a little
dull to start now leaves you teetering
on a cliff’s edge.
With sharp, biting dialogue and
epic, poetic monologues, the lack
of understanding on the part of the
audience seems trivial. We want to
know more, we want to hear more but
most of all, we want a release of the
tension. Birch’s mastery of emotion is
spectacular and I can only praise the
depths of the characters she offers us.
Yolanda Kettle and Paul Hickey as
Clarissa and Simon stand out against
the performances of Lorna Brown as
Alison and Paul Rattray as Teddy.
What feels muted and unpleasant in
Alison never seems to lift and by the
end, her actions don’t particularly
interest us. Simon in contrast is

refreshingly normal. The audience
both empathise and understand his
situation within the play, and in
many cases Simon’s observations of
Alison and Teddy are shared by the
audience.
The overall result is impressive,
but as a whole the show certainly
falls down in places. Its slow start
and Alison’s overly monotonous
behaviour can be tedious. But in the
context of the madness that unfolds,
our focus is well held by the tension
built throughout.
As a complete performance,
Birch can be proud of her script
transmission onto stage; perfectly
suited to the round and an interesting
insight into the vision of artistic
director Paul Miller, Little Light is an
emotionally tense and well thought
out journey. Examining the nature
of family and the pain of losing
someone dear to you, this show
provokes thought and even in its
sadness, leaves an audience satisfied
at the end.
Little Light is on until the 7th
March.
