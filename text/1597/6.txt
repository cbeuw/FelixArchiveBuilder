Union Council voted this
week to support the closure
of Weeks hall in order to
transform it into space that could
be used for childcare provisions for
academics.
The resolve was one of many
from a paper that also included the
suggestion to either close or keep
Pembridge Hall open too. Union
Council voted to support keeping it
open, although Union Council cannot
officially determine what College
decides eventually to do with the
properties.
It was explained by Tom Wheeler,
Imperial College Union President
that, as Weeks halls is a listed
building, it is difficult to renovate,
and internal structures cannot be
modified easily.
He also said that Weeks, although
containing 67 beds, has rooms with
a much larger floor space, and as a
whole, the hall is an “inefficient use
of space.”
He suggested that the hall could be
used instead for childcare facilities
for academics, in a move to address
the faltering number of women
academics that remain at Imperial
throughout their career.
Wheeler said during the meeting:
“I am keen to fight tooth and nail
to keep Pembridge hall, as I think it
is essential for our accommodation
portfolio, and we can also increase its
capacity by using some of its excess
annexe space.
“I’m less passionate about Weeks. It
could be put to better use.”
The students present at Council
initially were split in their decision to
keep Weeks, so as Council Chair, Paul
Beaumont was allowed the casting
vote. After choosing to vote in favour
of keeping Weeks as accommodation
and to mandate college for its
renovation, a student present at
the meeting challenged Beaumont,
and asked for an explanation for his
decision.
Ben Fernando, RAG Chair, then
asked to rerun the vote after the
student challenged the chair, and
those present were forced to vote
again. After this new vote, enough
people changed their vote, and
decided against mandating College to
keep Weeks as a student hall.
Paul spoke to Felix after the
meeting, and explained that he
used his casting vote to support
the ongoing use of Weeks Hall as
accommodation because he thought
Union Council vote to support closure
of Weeks Hall in Princes Gardens
Philippa Skett reports from meeting that brands hall “an inefficient use of space”
a significant enough proportion of
Council had issues with the closure
before the vote was rerun. However,
he allowed the revote to go ahead
when challenged, and explained that:
“I don’t particularly like using casting
votes to make democratic decisions.”
Wheeler also said to Felix after the
decision was made: “We admit that
a reduction of 60 bed spaces close
to campus is a loss, however it was
a mature decision taken by Union
Council to focus the lobbying and
campaigning resources of the Union
on saving Pembridge, a hall that can
be saved.”
However, those outside of the
meeting were less than impressed
with the news that Weeks may no
longer be used as halls.
One person on twitter was not
happy that the wardening and hall
senior team had allegedly not been
informed of the plans to close Weeks.
“Why did nobody mention this to the
wardening or senior team of Weeks?
Surely our voices, if any, should be
heard.”
Said an academic from Imperial:
“Devil is in the details, but it sounds
bad for students who want to live
cheaply and close to College.”
Said another Felix reader on our
facebook group: “I’m really sad to
hear this. It’s decisions like these
that is a large part of the reason
why Imperial doesn’t have the
strong alumni network of other
universities.”
Others said it was a sad decision,
although one did describe it as
“typical.” Another continued,
“It does go along with Imperial’s
accommodation strategy - the one
where they don’t care about us.”
Another student was unimpressed
with the decision, stating on twitter:
“How lovely for the 67 students who
now have to live further away from
campus.
“Maybe it’ll turn out as useful as
Garden [hall] has.”
Garden Hall, also situated in
Princes Garden but relatively cheaper
in price than other halls in Eastside
and Southside, was closed in 2013.
The hall was shut by the College
despite students protesting against
the closure.
There has recently been
construction work on the building,
and College Chaplaincy, the multi-
faith centre for Imperial, was moved
into Garden Hall after renovations
were done on the East Basement of
Beit where it was previously based.
