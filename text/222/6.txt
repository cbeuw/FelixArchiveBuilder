Rag Week
Chris Hocking speaks to John Cawson and Ian Williams
Trust Chairman
Explains Its Aims
J J A L F W A Y T H R O U G H Rag Week Carnival Chairman Chris
Hocking reported that the Carnival had so far raised £140.
Street collections had contributed £60 towards this. The Guy
Fawkes bonfire procession around the West End alone raised £17.
However, banners are costing £15 for the materials.
We asked Chris Hocking how well
he thought the Week had gone. He
regretted that it had not received as
much support as he would have liked.
A n advertising manager could not be
appointed betore Monday 9 Novem-
ber.
He himself had been too busy
working on the legalities, getting l i -
cences for house-to-house collections,
to have time to see about posters
himself.
Last year the Rev. Bruce Kenrick,
Chairman of the Notting H i l l Housing
Trust, expressed fears- of irresponsible
actions by IC Carnival reflecting on
the Trust. Chris has no fears in this
respect this year. A l l stunts will need
the approval of Commando Leader
Rog. Cook (17 Old Beit) and the Car-
nival Committee.
We suggested that a Christmas gift
might be welcomed by the Trust. This
he endorsed, adding that of course it
very much depended upon how much
the Rag raised. The sum of £650—
sufficient to make possible the housing
of one large family—seemed to be a
suitable figure to aim for.
After Rag Week the Carnival Chair-
man hopes that each of the larger
clubs and societies will go out on
stunts to collect for the Carnival each
weekend. He felt that it was essential
that Carnival should run continuously
through the year, not just for one
week last year.
N H H T appear to be more in need
of money than help. In spite of this
Chr'~ felt that working parties were
as essential a part of the Carnival
effort as the collections themselves.
He knew of only two such working
parties last year.
To the suggestion that collectors do
not know enough about the Trust, the
Carnival Chairman told us. that the
Committee at least were well-informed
and that he was hoping to arrange a
General Studies lecture which could be
given more publicity than the one last
year.
Another point he made was that he
hopes to train next year's Carnival
Committee this year.

" THE CONDITIONS in Nott-
ing Hill are really very little
different from those in Harlem.
Harlem has the outward appear-
ance of a slum—with its dirty
streets—which Notting Hill has
not got, but once you get inside
the houses they are very similar."
Bruce Kenrick, chairman of the
Notting Hill Housing Trust was
talking to Felix on the work of
the Trust.
Bruce Kenrick has spent his life
working for the Church in different
parts of the world. Before coming
to Notting H i l l he worked in India
and Harlem—both places with serious
tensions and housing problems.
A:ked whether he thought that the
problems of India made those of
Notting H i l l appear insignificant, he
pointed out that it is easier to live
without a house in Calcutta. It does
not get cold at night—and it is an
accepted thing to sleep on the station
platforms, whereas it is not here ;
not that it is desirab'e there.
No. 107 Blenheim Crescent acts as
the headquarters of the Trust. In ap-
pearance it is exactly the same as the
other rather shabby houses in the area,
only the small piece of card on the
door showing it to be the Trust's
Practical Christianity
It was in 1963 M r . Kenrick came
to live in Notting Hill, and with a
g:oup of local people formed the
i rust. Bruce Kenrick is a minister of
the Church of Scotland, and he con-
siders the trust to be his new parish.
He believes that the Church should
not be merely a building on the cor-
ner with services at eleven and six.
The Church should be involved with
people and their lives. Every Wednes-
day the workers in the Trust's office

meet at his home for Communion.
This does not mean, however, that
the trust tries automatically to con-
vert their tenants—the subject of re-
ligion must be raised by the tenant
first and no discrimination on religious
grounds is practised when selecting
tenants. Indeed a couple of weeks ago
Mr. Kenrick had a party of Scottish
Presbyterians and a number of mem-
bers of the Notting H i l l Atheist
Society working together for the trust.
Political Activity.
The Royal Borough of Kensington
and Chelsea has the lowest proportion
of council houses in the whole of
Greater London—5 per cent. The
council is not very interested in this
district and in M r . Kenrick's words
the local M.P. " would occupy his
time better looking at these problems
than in drawing Westminster Bridge."
The 1965 Rent Act should give se-
curity of tenure and a fair rent to
those bold enough to claim them but
it cannot give families the kitchen or
unshared toilets that they need. Both
political parties agree that it will take
nine to ten years to provide homes for
all those who have no home at all.
The people of Notting H i l l cannot
wait that long. Political lobbying is
essential to their cause but the trust
cannot wait passively for the ponder-
ous machinery of government to act.
Successful Integration
At the end of its first eighteen
months the trust had bought eleven
houses and rehoused 150 people. By
the end of 1965 the Trust hopes to
have homes for more than 600 people.
" Whatever you do, don't bring any
of those blacks here"—words from
the tenants already in one of the
houses which the Trust bought. This
underlines the racial tensions simmer-
ing below the surface in the area.
However, the most urgent need that
the Trust came up against next was
to rehouse a family consisting of an
Irish wife, a West Indian husband and
four children. They were put in
the house, and now on Saturday
nights the old pensioners and the
West Indians drink their beer together,
singing calypsos and Welsh songs. In
the next house an African repaired
the pram of an English woman who
had gone to hospital 4o have a baby,
and the Indian woman in the house
was the only visitor that the woman
had whilst she was in hospital.
Tenants are selected from recom-
mendations made by the Notting Hill
Social Council and visits made by
members of the Trust to the families.
The Trust attempts to allocate houses
to the different races in the area in
the same proportions as are in the
whole Noting Hill community.
I.C. and the Trust
Mr. Kenrick is very grateful for
the work that Imperial College did for
the Trust last year and is hoping that
we will bs more successful this vear.
Last year he said that was a little
afraid t.v.-t irresponsible acts by the
college might bring the name of the
Notting Hill Housing Trust into dis-
repute. He was remembering his own
days of running up the main road in
Edinburgh d.'essed in a grass skirt.
This year, he said, " After the suc-
cess of last year, I have no such
worries."
