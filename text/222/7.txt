Hall Parties Lead
Mating Stakes —
Kanta Pools Revealed
T / H E UNIVERSITY of Lon-
don Union and General
Studies appear to be not very
papular with the majority of stu-
dents. The average IC Union
member seems to spend less than
half-an-hour a week at U L U .
And he goes to one General
Studies lecture per three weeks.
These are two of the results of a
Kanta Pell survey conducted in the
Co.kge over the past three weeks by
Nigel Leppard, Far d Hassan, Barbara-
Hedge, Susan Gibbs and Seng Choa.
A table cf soma of the results and
comments on these and others are
given below.
U L U also seems to miss out in re-
lation to " picking u p " a girl (or
boy, according to sex.) Of the four
categories posed U L U was found to
be three or four times less popular
than hall parties, I C U functions and
other colleges. Hall parties in fact
lead the mating stakes by a short
head.
However, those who are already
" going steady " seem to want to get
away from the college or university to
entertain their regular girl (or boy)
friends. But generally going out to
London theatres, cinemas, euncerts,
jazz Ciubs, etc does not seem to be a
regular weekly affair for three-quar-
ters of those questioned ; eight people
claimed never to seek the bright
lights.
Only six categories of residence are
quoted in the table below. In the
questionnaire eight were considered—
i.e. halls/hostels, flats/bedsitters, par-
tial-board lodgings and home, each
within or outside a three mile radius
of College. Only six completed
questionnaires were obtained for
two of these, so they have been omit-
ted from the table. Columns 3 and
6 are also liable to more error than
the rest owing to lack of information.
I suspect that there has been a gene-
ral underestimation of travel times.
Certainly for students living in IC
Halls as these have been considered as
nil. A n extra five minutes to each of
these figures perhaps gives a truer
picture.
Certain advantages of living in
Hall are immediately obvious. The
high representation of club officials in
Hall is attributable to two factors—
1. That they obtained their places in
Hall because they were club officials;
2. that by being in Hall they can be
more intimately invo.ved in Union
affairs and thus arc able to gain office.
In sporting activities Hall dwellers
seem to be twice as active as others.
Living at home and looking after
oneself also seem to militate against
the student's activity in social and
recreational pursuits in IC Union.

t Tin
Shin and Eye
N O W HERE'S A N O T H E R tin
which you might find useful.
It's Casserole brand stewed steak.
Actually it is tha only Casserole
branc" I've ever found, and I think
has been on the market for
several years. Packed in Ireland,
and passed by their Department
of Agriculture," the tin contains
high quality beet, no fat, and salt
only. It may look a little dry at
first, but you'll find that there is
no need to add anything, it's deli-
cious with bread or potatoes, but
you can, of course, if you feel
ambitious, use it in stew form, to-
gether with onions, carrots, toma-
toes in a saucepan or in the oven.
It is ready cooked, so it would be
best to add only cooked or half-
cooked vegetables, but obviously
it takes a lot of the effort out of
stew making. A small tin, to
give you a generous one person
meal, is 2s. 3d.
Beauty on the Cheap
This week I thought I would see if
I could find you some make-up and
beauty hints on a budget. There are
two Woolworth's and Boots the
Chemists in the area. One Wool-
worth's, on the new block in Ken-
sington High Street past the Royal
Garden Hotel, and another in the
Brompton Road, opposite Brompton
Oratory. * Both these shops could be
very useful, say I, hoping you have
not already covered this ground your-
self.
Boots have a large range of their
beauty products all round, 4s. first
size. These general necessities could
form your basic make-up wardrobe.
Foundation, (if you want it) 4s. and
"All-in-one," a complete make up, 6s.
I would especially recommend their
moisture cream, 4s. 6d., small size,
for oily skins too, occasionally, and
lipsticks, if you like really creamy
ones, 3s. 6d. Nail polish is 3s.
There are three identical looking bot-
tles all at 4s. 6d., containing Skin
Freshner, Complexion Milk and Tone-
up Lotion for oily skin types.
Then they have another range, 365,
including a light hair spray, good for
setting too, 5s. 6d., talc. Is. 9d., Eau
de Cologne and Lavender Water, to
U,se of 1C bars rathe; than others is
to some extent dependent on proxi-
mity, though of those interviewed it
is interesting to note that in general
those who have to fend for themselves
tend to spend more time drinking.

gating how overseas stuients fare.

refresh, 2s., first size. Large size
Bubble Bath, for economy and Family
Size Shampoo. 3s. 6d., in identical
plastic bottles. From the shampoo
bottle you can get about 25 shampoos
(they say 30, but I have long hair).
I have also noted their new roll-
on deoderant, Elfin, in pale green un-
breakable bottle, 4s. with refills, in-
cluding spoon-like roller remover,
2s. 9d. M y personal impression—most
successful.
Eyes Right.
Woo'.worth's are, of course, one of
the few stockists of that well known
brand " Outdoor G i r l , " though good-
ness knows where they got the name;
I have heard from consumer magazine
sources that the formula is the same
as many of the more expensive makes.
With the emphasis just now on "as
much mascara as you have spit for,"
why use spit? This manufacturer has
brought out Marvelash, in a pretty
gold and white case, spiral brush
form, 5s. 6d., containing tiny fibres
to build up lashes; refills too, 3s. 6d.
Another mascara, which I have for a
long time found more successful than
" G i r l ' s " ordinary one, is Miners, in
a bottle, 3s. This firm originated in
the States, and has caught on well
here. They have two lipstick prices,
Is. 6d., and 2s 9d., and varnish, hard
wearing, Is. 6d. and 2s. 6d. Try their
eye make-up remover too, Is. 3d. Both
these makes have a liquid liner,
2s. 9d., and Is. 9d.. >ut as this is some-
times a problem, ; ook for Outdoor
Girl's new brush-on Brow Colour.
Matt in a round clear case, 2s. 9d.,
including b('ush, black, brown and
jrey, you could, make il a dj.il pur-
pose economy buy with an eyeliner
brush, at Is. 8d. Powder eyeshadow
you may find more satisfactory t h n
cream—as it is less likely to ro
streaky; G i r l again, Is. 8d. or C JO
blue and green at 2s. 9d. in soft pretty
shades, but beware, don't be too
" heavy handed," when it's on it won't
come off!! Good tones are to be
found in their powder rouge too—
Is. 8d.—if you are a pale skin tone.
Cheap Shampoo
Well if you are still " broke " and
can't evon afford a tviiampoo,
stealing some of the Editor's Lux
Liquid or Squeezy, especially if you
have dry hair, it's great at 2s. 6d!
Did you know, that the models
use:—
vaseline for lip-gloss, Boots" Baby
Lotion for cleanser, and mix Witch-
hazel and Rosewater (you can get
them both from Boots) to form their
astringent.
