Irrational Optimism
& Unthinking Faith
• y W O arrogant groups with little common ground. This was the
impression I gained after the joint meeting of the Huxley and
Catholic Societies. Both groups sheltered behind their shields—the
Humanists safe in their "entertainment of the possibility of anything,"
and the Catholics with their " but you cannot argue about that—it is
a matter of belief."
The meeting opened with a lucid
statement of the position of the Ro-
man Catholics, by John Rogan, fol-
lowed by an outline of the type of
approach to life that would be made
by a Humanist, given by Dave Dunn
of the Huxley Society.
These decided that the " reason for
belief " was " not suitable for discus-
sion, as it involves what is called faith
—
a gift from God," and that it was
to the effects of belief or unbelief on
our ways of life, that' the meeting
should turn, if it was to find any com-
mon ground.
During the discussion which fol-
lowed not very much emerged, except
that each side did not appreciate how
the other could base their life on so
thin a tissue—" an unthinking faith
in the goodness of God " and " a kind
of woolly benevolence, propped up
by irrational optimisrn."
However, after the,,statements that
" Most of the best brains in the last
two thousand years have been Catho-
lic," and " from a purely rational
standpoin' Catholic belief shows a
lack of mne. strength, (the believer)
needing someone behind h i m , " the
Chairman, Graham Thompson of
Huxley Society, drew the conclusion
that the meeting "was not getting any-
where," and suggested that those pre-
sent draw their armchairsi nto small
groups, while coffee was served,
These last three quarters of an hour
provided the justification for the whole
evening, all concerned agreeing that
it was worth while and enjoyable. It
is from this contact in small groups',
that most benefit is obtained, and it
is to be hoped that other Societies
learn from this in the future, and split
the main meeting up sooner, as is
Huxley Society's usual practice, i n -
stead of letting the assembly drift into
a backwater of unsupportable state-
ments.

Mooney Meals
Teaspoon Losses
\ H U N D R E D D O Z E N tea-
spoons have been stolen from
Southside since it has been
opened. In fact, M r . Victor
Mooney, the Refectory Manager,
reckoned that he was losing £201)
worth of cutlery per year.
On being asked what he was doing
to prevent this vast reduction in cut-
lery, Mr. Mooney said that the staff
were being carefully watched and
accidental losses to the swillbins were
being prevented.
But he said that it was clear that
the majority of this equipment was
being stolen by students to stock
their flats. In order to cover his
costs he was going to have to put the
food prices up.
Last summer Dave Bishop, then
President of Guilds, conducted a sur-
vey on food in Southside. The survey
and various recommendations were
handed to M r . Mooney but nothing
has been heard of it since.
The only action that is being taken
by the Refectory Committee at the
moment is in trying to keep the food
hot on the counter. Extra heaters
and guards to prevent draughts are
in the processs of being installed
When this has been completed, the
Caterers will look into the matter of
providing one very cheap dish (about
2s.) per meal. This is all the activity
that the comprehensive and vital
Bishop Report has produced.

he has received more complaints
about Southside food than Beit.

Bo at Brighton
Guilds President Oversleeps
Q N A C O L D wet Sunday morning, 30 pyjama-ed Guildsmeu
without their president, saw Bo off with a Boomalaka from Hyde
Park Corner. Bo nearly met with immediate disaster when the brakes
failed behind some stationary traffic. Disaster was avoided, thanks
to the quick action of Rog Lawrence, the driver, who took Bo to the
right of an oncoming car, to the horror of onlooking police.
A few moments later the trembler
box came loose, but it was soon
mended with a little wire and ingenu-
ity. The rest of the journey passed
smoothly, and half way to Brighton
Bo was joined by the president of
City and Guilds, D a i Howell, cold and
wet after a long scooter chase.
The party reached Brighton 3 hrs.
20 mins. after it had started, having
travelled at an average speed of
nearly 19 m.p.h. The members of the
party, driver, co-drjver John Diamond,
the Motor Club president Hank Sweet,
and D a i Howell with other Guilds-
men, lunched with Bo's designer C o l .
Brown.
This was Bo's 23rd successful run
to Brighton and the C. and G . Motor
Club are to be congratulated on the
condition i n which they have kept Bo.

Mikado Pleases
Girls Enthusiastic - Men Pompous
L A S T W E E K T H E C O L L E G E saw a polished performance
of one of Gilbert and Sullivan's wittiest operas. The huge
cast of I.C. men was supplemented by women from various music,
nursing and secretarial colleges. It was these girls that gave the pro-
duction the enthusiasm and spon- superb rendering of " A wandering
taneity so essential to bring off
any Gilbert and Sullivan work.
They showed up the male chorus
as rather serious and pompous.
The lead male singers did appreci-
ate the humorous nature of the opera
however, and delightted us with both
Gilbert's witticism and their own
visual humour. Chris Hocking, (Lord
High Everything Else) was seen lying
on his back unable to turn over or
sit up because of his rotundity. Rich-
ard Ault had somehow managed to
fix flashing lights to his eyelids—every-
time the Mikado blinked, his eyes
shone with cruelty.
Tony Smyth as Nanki,-Poo gave a
Minstrel." His make-up, however
made h i m an unconvincing lover to
be made for Frances Gregory who
played Yum-Yum ; her voiced ranged
with perfect control through every
emotion, her face sparkled with excite-
ment and when she laughed she did so
estatically. The audience seemed cap-
tivated by her charm and sweetness.
With such quality of performers,
competence in production and enthu-
iasm for the music itself, the perform-
ance could not fail to entertain. The
one thing badly lacking was an audi-
ence—where were the pretty girls
selling tickets in Southside?—where
was the high power advertising we
are now so used to?

WAITRESS OR WAIT LESS?
The refectory Committee is to look
into the possibility of changing the
waitress service refectory into another
self-service one, and bringing the
prices into line, in order to relieve
the pressure on the present cheaper
refectories.
A POLICEMAN'S WORD . . .
A n Icwarian in Aero II was trying
to cross the road in the vicinity of a
Morphy crowd. A policeman who
saw her problem escorted her across
the road and consoled her with the
words, " Don't worry, love, they're
only students."
