S A T U R D A Y M O R N I N G S A W the
successful abduction of the North-
ampton College mascot. The 3-cwt.
" K i n g Carrot III," a previously un-
attainable mascot, was carried away
by twenty dedicated men, under the
guidance of I.C.. Wooden Horse Club.
The team arrived at Northampton
early and at 9.15 a.m., precisely the
" plan " went into operation. Half
were posted on staircases, two immo-
bilised the siren connected to the
mascot, and the rest went to the scene
of action. This wasi' conveniently
si tuated in a common ,room safe from
security guards.
Having ceremoniously silenced an
inquisitive Northampton individual,
and explained to a cleaner that they
would not " like to come back on
Monday," the carrot snatchers set
about removing the mascot from its
supports.
The gateway was not completed
without mishap. During a-hasty flight
down the stairs the carrot went out of
control, trapping the unfortunate M a x
Liddie, of Maths 111, and injuring his
ankle. Max and mascot were carried
to a van, and the raiding party es-
caped, leaving a trail of fibreglass and
concrete in their wake.
MORALS
AT SILWOOD
" I L O O K E D round to see if any-
One was looking and then took a flying
leap across the road and planted my
foot right in its face." Professor
Cherry was describing his attitude to
one of Her Majesty's stamp machines
that had robbed him of his penny.
It was the first Touchstone week-
end of this session, forty-one mem-
bers of the college were meeting at
Silwood Park to discuss, " .Morals in
a technological world." In his open-
ing talk Professor Cherry stressed the
dangers of master-slave attitude to
our society. The machine, he sug-
gested, was at its best when it was not
noticed.
In his opinion, changing technology
leads to changing morals, with the
coming of new techniques, we are
faced with new problems at a time
when we are given little moral guid-
ance. This is especially true of our
children. We have removed all ele-
ments of excitement from the life of
our urban communities—"Only adults
are allowed to smash things." It is
impossible for a child to come by
danger legally.
OUTCAST
T H E R E S P O N S E from R S M to
appeals for help in the construc-
tion of Mike, I.C.'s mascot-to-be has
been almost non-existant. Minesmen
willing to help are asked to contact
Ralph Cornforth (Physics or Union
Racks, or H A T 5651 evenings) at the
earliest opportunity. Casting experi-
ence though not essential, would be
useful.
EGEND DESTROYED
THE IMPOSSIBLE
DEVALUATION THREATENS
STUDENTS
l r
T H E M A N Y Rhodesian and Central Afr'can students at the College will
not, it seems, be affected (immediately) by the Rhodesian crisis. The
greatest threats are that sanctions brought to bear on Rhodesia by other
countries will lead to devaluaion of Rhodes'an currency, and, therefore a
reduction in the value of grants.
Measures taken by Zambia to
protect herself might include limita-
tions on export of money, which
would affect Zambians at IC.
Feeling is running high among
African students, but' the only physi-
cal effect noted so far is the great
amount of discussion. However, it is
thought that if the need arises, Africa
Society will organise a lobbying of the
College Authorities and local M.P.s
for assistance to students who find
themselves in difficulties due to the
U D I . Similar action was taken when
the Nigerian Government reduced
grants to students studying abroad.
However it is significant that
several Rhodesian students refused to
comment, even anonymously, to
Felix, due to possible repercussions
from one side or another—Rhodes-
ians undergoing military training in
the U K have been asked to leave,
and, " of course I am rather worried
about the folk at home."
Fortunately many students have
British passports, and the British
Government has announced that it
will make it easier for Rhodesians
who who desire it to take out British
Citizenship—and this is something no
rebel government can take away.
CO ESCAPE CLEARS
LABORATORY
Since no breathing apparatus suit-
able for use in CO was available,
Dave Lawson and T i m Wickins re-
NUMBER
PLEASE
" T H I S
PLACE is a mad-
house !" The telephone operator
threw up her arms in dismay.
The "madhouse" is a little-
known room on the first floor of
the Beit building, where four
womerc work tha College switch-
board, putting through up to 800
calls an hour each. Between
them they handle 1,100 exten-
sions and 50 external lines for
eight busy hours every day.
At 6 p.m. one of the two male night
operators takes over the switchboard.
One girl stays on till eight, but he is
on duty for 15 hours.
" We each handle more calls than
any of the girls at B E A , which is con-
sidered to be one of the busiest switch-
boards in the country." commented
one operator. The equipment is old
— a new exchange is due to be instal-
led in January—and in the past month
there have been three mechanical
faults.
Consequently a number of outside
callers have been greeted by a ringing
tone when they should have had the
engaged signal. In addition the week-
end before last one man was sick.
M.R.I.W.
entered the evacuated laboratory to
turn off the second valve on the
cylinder. Then a technician wearing
an unsuitable mask went' in to remove
it.
It is understood from the Chemistry
Department that Professor Wilkinson
has now ordered self-contained
breathing apparatus.
N . Ed.: It emerges from this incident
that there are no gas masks avail-
able in the Chemistry Department
suitable for use by wearers of spec-
tacles. We hope that this will soon
be remedied.
FIRE IN
ELEC ENG
O N E O F four fire tenders leaving
Guilds' quadrangle on Friday after a
small fire (under control before the
tenders arrived) in Electrical Engin-
eering is saown below. This was the
seventh fire engine to come to the
College in two days.
Fire tenders get access to most Col-
lege buildings through Imperial Insti-
tute Road, and yet the car parking
attendants in this road have no emer-
gency telephone to warn them that
emergency service vehicles are on the
way, and that admittance of more
lorries, delivery vans, etc., is no
longer desirable. The time saved in
not having to move an articulated
lorry may only be a few seconds, but
for the expenditure of a small sum,
and instructing the College telephone
operator that the car-parking atten-
dants in Imperial Institute Road are
the second people to ring after sum-
moning the fire brigade, it may mean
a few lives. N . Ed.
