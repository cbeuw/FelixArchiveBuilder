The Third World
T H E Y ' V E A L W A Y S been there—the starving, illiterate mute
poor of the world ; but they don't feature in history as we know
it, which is mostly a record of the doings of a well-fed European
minority. They existed in Europe, too, till the Industrial Revolu-
tion gave them power and a voice, and now they have the vote a: J
affluence. Now the non-whites, the world's lower classes, are demand-
ing their share of power and |
wealth. Now they're 70 per cent,
o? the world's population, and
th /'re getting 44 per cent, of its
fool. In 2000 they'll be 80 per
ce.ii. of the world, and how much
food will they get then ?
Of the people who live in the
Third World, 10-15 per cent are under-
nourished—they just don't get enough
to eat. Up to half are malnourished'—
they don't get the right sort of food.
The world's rate of population in-
crease is two per cent per annum—an
exponential growth that will swamp
any attempt at economic development
if left unchecked. For population
growth is not itself a cause of poverty
— i t was inflicted on already poor
nations by Western medicine—but
birth control is a necessary condition
for economic improvement from the
present intolerable squalor of the
world.
The Huxley Society's World Popu-
lation Week, which begins next
Monday, features the work of the
Family Planning International Cam-
paign, which enlists support in this
country for family planning agencies
all over the world. Its associated
agencies work with government assist-
ance, in India, Malaya, Indonesia,
Chile and many other countries, and
without government help in many
others; it can report substantial suc-
cess in experiments run in Hong
Kong, Singapore, Bengal and Puerto
Rico. Its associated agencies give
advice in all forms of contraception,
from the Pill to the rhythm method.
A safe, once-a-month oral contra-
ceptive is Mankind's best hope for a
decent future: it doesn't exist yet, but
a representative from G . D. Searle
and Co., British manufacturers of
the Pill, will talk on the subject and
show films.
The equally essential factor in the
race against famine is development.
There are colossal difficulties in the
way of persuading the subsistence
farmer to raise his productivity. The
effect of modern technology is to draw
the ablest, youngest people from the
land where they are most needed, into
the city slums. A representative of
the Centre for Urban Studies will
speak during the Week.
There will be a fixed exhibition in
the main entrance of Southside
during the Week; this, and the other
activities of the period will, we hope,
provide the material for a general
discussion of the population problem
on the Friday evening, at which we in
Huxley Society particularly want to
hear something of the opinions of
people in this college who actually
come from developing countries, for
it's only too easy for outsiders to see
a problem in terms which are in-
applicable on the spot.
To my mind, a decent standard of
living is what modern science and
technology are for—to liberate human
beings, all of them, from purely ma-
terial wants, and to create life from
living death.
