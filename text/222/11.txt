FELI X 11
IT'S GUILDS
-AGAIN
year s race pro-
\J[ FOR MUD, M for Morphy and M for Much fine rowing, which
is what it's all about anyway. If the outcome of the towpath
battles was predictable, that of the waterborne one was not. With
the Guilds Morphy crew little faster in practice than their Lowry
eight; with the Mines number 7 out with a strained back; with R.C.S.
a very much improved and unknown factor ; this
mised one of the best contests yet.
Eager to prove their new found
strength R.C.S. sped ahead at the
start with Mines leading a slow-start-
ing Guilds. R.C.S.'s start turned out
to be more optimism than judgement
and Guilds, rowing well, moved up
on Mines, then R.C.S. and pulled
steadily away to win once again. Left
to fight for second place R.C.S. and
Mines passed the boat house with the
Miners leading by a canvas and un-
derrating their rivals whom they went
on to beat by about a length.
Caught a Crab
The Lowry race, which actually
took place first, was never in quite
such doubt. Guilds, the sure favour-
ites, led right from the start with
mines close upon them. From Beverly
Brook, however, the Engineers began
to move away easily and it was again
left to the other two to scrap for se-
cond place. After losing a length
on the start R.C.S. had fought back
to withi.n a length when, in the last
20 strokes, they caught a crab. They
finished 1| lengths down on Mines
who were 4 lengths behind the win-
ners.
JUDO
T R Y I N G THEIR STRENGTH
in a multi-team contest at Ox-
ford the Judo team fought above
themselves to draw with Cam-
bridge and beat Oxford.
Out ranked in the higher grades by
3 brown and 1 green belts to 2 blues
and 2 greens (the order is black,
brown, blue, green, etc) the final score
of 20-20 showed our teams determina-
tion at its best. The best performance
of the match was that of Phil Prescott
who although only a green belt him-
self had a clear win over one of Cam-
bridge's two brown belts.
By the time they came to fight Ox-
ford some of the Oxford team had had
to leave and so they put their instruc-
tor, a brown belt, into the contest.
Including him we drew 10-10 but the
match result, discounting him, was
10-0 for I.C.
A team, that was virtually our
second, convincingly beat Chelsea col-
lege 40-20 in a belt-for-belt contest
at Chelsea last week. Highlights of
this match were the wins of two be-
ginners who have only been learning
Judo since the start of term and if
they keep this up they should do well
in the future.

DO WE CAREP
T ^ H E M O R P H Y and Lowry races must be the best supported oi
the college sporting events as far as numbers watching is con-
cerned yet how many actually go to watch the rowing, or could even
tell you who won afterwards ?
T i e swimming Gala is well suppor-
ted but again few go out of interest in
the races, and the other, non-president-
ducking, events such as Sports Day
and the Soccer and Rugby Cup Finals
are hardly supported at all. It is diffi-
cult to find convincing reasons why
people should go to watch such events
but when you go to play matches at
places like St. Mary's or Borough
Road, where there is always a signi-
ficant and voluble touchline audience.
the atmosphere is quite different and
far more exciting. Perhaps we have
just grown too large and diverse an
institution to be that interested in
each others doings.
If this is because we are all busy
with our own activities then maybe
it is really a healthy sign but if it's
because people are just too apathe-
tically lazy to make an effort we are
missing a vital part of university life.

THE FACTS ?

WINNING
WAYS
' " P H I S W E E K has been a very sac-
cessful one for all women's teams.
The womens hockey X I have won
the'r way into the second round of the
U.L. Cup by defeating Guy's 5-0. In
a very hard fought match our girls,
playing together well, showed their
superiority over a slightly weakened
Guy's team.
The badminton team have made
history by achieving their second win
of the season, defeating Kings by 7
sets to 2 in an admittedly on&-sided
match.
At the other end of the scale the
table tennis team preserved their un-
beaten record by beating Q.E.C. 7
sets to 3. This success was due to the
brilliant play of Phornphan Stholunta
and Christine Youle who won all their
games.
ON THE UP
I.C. C H E S S M E N are at present
waging a giant-killing campaign.
Although they have only just gained
promotion to the 1st division of the
London League they are making a
strong bid to get to the top of it in
their first season. Starting with a
solid 8-4 win over Southgate, who
were also promoted this year, they
then took on last year's champions
Hampstead and gave them a 6 i - 3 i vote
of no confidence.
I.C. 9 Richmond 12
T H E C O L L E G E won the toss and
played the first half with the wind
diagonally with them. Although
somewhat overawed by the strength of
the opposition a very good start was
made and the first fifteen minutes
were spent around the Richmond 25.
Ray missed a difficult penalty chance
but a few minutes later made amends
by kicking a difficult goal from the
touchline across the wind. Terri-
torial advantage was still maintained
and Ray kicked another penalty
from a similar position on the oppo-
site touchline.
Half time came with the score 6—0
in I.C.'s favour which was not enough
considering the wind advantage which
would belong to Richmond in the
second half.
Playing Well
However l.C. showed their best
form of the season and continued to
drive the opposition back against the
wind but Richmond managed to
equalise by a drop goal and a penalty
and then take tthe lead through
another penalty. With the college
still playing well the backs began to
run and handle with confidence and
eventually scored a good try through
Riley, the left wing. At this time
the Vikings considered themselves
very lucky to draw, but I C . con-
ceded a penalty fully 55 yds. from
their posts and a goal was kicked by
full back Moffat, an Oxfordshire cap
giving Richmond a win ; much
against the run of the play.

With the cold unfrhrtdly wind
cutting across the Thames on
Morphy Day, the three crews
wrench at the oars.
Athletes
WINTER
TRACK
T H E nights draw in and the
weather gets colder, the
natural tendency of most athletes
is to retire to the warmth of a
fireside and leave their strenuous
oiftdawr activities 'til the warmer
weather.
This year, however, things are dif-
ferent and last Saturday morning
took our Athletics team down to
Motspur Park for the first meeting of
the new winter league. Despite the
early hour and a cold gale sweeping
across the track I.C. started well and
although final results have not yet
been received we may even be leading
the league.
Stars of the meeting were Pete
Shuddeboom who won the 880 yds. in
2m. 0.1s. then followed up with 2nd
place in the 440 yds., and High Jumper
Mike Evans who beat our other two
high jumpers with a clearance of 6ft.
It was not exactly a clearance,
he hit the bar that hard that it had not
the strength to fall off. A d d to this
a win in the long jump by Paul Jones
and thirds and fourths in the throwing
events and we should be well to the
fore.
Hockey
CUPSLIP
I.C. 1. St. Mary's Hosp. 2
A F I N E M A T C H played at a
cracking pace throughout saw I.C's
excellent mid-field play go unre-
warded through poor finishing in the
circle. For evey three of the club's
missed chances, St. Mary's had only
one but each spelt danger.
I.C. pressed from the start, but at
quarter-time, with the defence heavily
committed, St. Mary's scored from a
b";akaway. At threequarter time,
Hough scored from a long corner to
force the game into overtime. Once
again l.C. looked like scoring when
upset by an opportunist's goal from
the right in a moment of confusion.
Of the new faces in the side Sachs
worked tirelessly and was impressive,
putting Clarke away with some fine
passes. Ramsay as unsteady but
snowed good promise. Aprat from
the problem c4 finding an inside for-
ward who will work, this promises to
be a good season.
