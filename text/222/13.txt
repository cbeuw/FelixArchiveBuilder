A promising f u t u r e f o r the gas-turbine engine w&s p r e d i c t e d at the
Engineering Society on Tuesday, November 9th,, when Mr.P.A.Philips, of the
Rover Car Co,,, l e c t u r e d on ''The small gas-turbine and i t s automotive
a p p l i c a t i o n s " . 1
-
B r i e f l y o u t l i n i n g the h i s t o r y of the\gas-turbine engine as used i n
road v e h i c l e s , M r . P h i l i p s explained that the m a j o r i t y of n e c e s s a r y v ' *
development work had already been c a r r i e d out, so that the delay i n the
i n t r o d u c t i o n of a turbine-cngined car was a matter of reducing production
costs to a l e v e l comparable with those of conventional piston-engines.
The speaker described the development of the power u n i t f o r the Rover-
B.R.M, r a c i n g car which competed so s u c c e s s f u l l y i n the Le Mans 24-hour
race i n 1963 and 1965, winning, on i t s f i r s t entry, a s p e c i a l p r i z e as
the f i r s t turbine-engined car to complete the 24-hour race at an average
speed of 93m,p.h.
The primary c o n s i d e r a t i o n of design f o r t h i s engine was r e l i a b i l t y ,
and that t h i s was achieved was shown by i t s performance i n the l a t t e r race
when the car s a t i s f a c t o r i l y completed the course despite consi.dera.ble
i n t e r n a l damage due t o metal f a i l u r e ,
M r , P h i l i p s concluded by saying that the i n c r e a s i n g range of' a p p l i c a t -
ions of the gas-turbine engine was p r o v i d i n g valuable experience i n
production methods, and he c o n f i d e n t l y predicted that the gas-turbine
would e v e n t u a l l y become a superior a l t e r n a t i v e t o the p i s t o n engine f o r
automotive use. R.A.D.
Twice "in the past f o r t n i g h t shattered beer mugs have appeared on the
path near the bar, outside the Union B u i l d i n g , On the f i r s t occassion a
p i n t mug was apparently thrown from one of the upper windows of the b u i l d -
ing, narrowly missing a student walking below. Then on Saturday night
"somebody"'1
threw a mug through one of the lounge windows. Maybe there i s
a r a t i o n a l excuse f o r both i n c i d e n t s but 'enquiries have f a i l e d t o show
t h i s .
Student high s p i r i t s are one thin^r but endangering others i s not funny.
We know that the age of students coming t o I.C. gets loiver but t h i s i s no
excuse f o r behaviour worthy of a second-former.
I n c i d e n t a l l y I thought the idea behind the " l a d i e s r
bar" i n the lower
lounge was that i t was to be a place where the women of I.C. and other
female guests could be refreshed f r e e from the usual bawdiness that r e i g n s
in the main bar. Anyone who has passed through the lower lounge during
these past few weeks w i l l have found l i t t l e evidence of t h i s purpose. I t
seems to have become an extension of the a l l - m a l e preserve next-door. So
you chaps of '"that club" and others, unless you have female company, use"
the o l d bar please; where you may swear and sing t o your heart's d e l i g h t ,
