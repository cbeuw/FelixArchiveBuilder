Jour
Career
Perhaps you haven't decided exactly which career you
want to follow. But the odds are that your general ideas
on the subject are fairly well worked out. Perhaps you
have a list of requirements in the back of your mind.
These, at a guess, would be some of the items in that list:
1 A large organisation (you
• may have been thinking of the
giants of commerce or industry,
whose names are household words).
One of the reasons why this is a
reasonable requirement is that, es-
pecially in modern conditions, large
organisations tend to offer much
more scope than small ones.
*
% Good pay and prospects. You
* expect to work hard, and it is only
fair that this should have some
tangible and obvious recognition.
3 Security. You do not want to
be forever wondering whether
your job is about to give you up!
A Variety of work. The idea of
• strap-hanging in the same train
every morning, sitting at the same
desk every day, doing the same job
year after year is probably repug-
nant to you.
E A chance to see something of
** the world. The idea of travel is
attractive, and if it can be part of
your job, so much the better.
C Congenial company. You ex-
" pect to apply yourself to your
career, and want to be able to relax
among people who share your inter-
ests and can discuss your problems
against a background of common
knowledge.
H A sense of purpose. You are,
* above all, anxious not to waste
your talents and your time. You
want your work to have some mean-
ing and significance; to amount to
something.
These are all eminently reasonable
requirements. And the R. A.F. meets
every one of theroJ
More than this, the R.A.F. is especi-
ally attractive to the graduate. As a
graduate in the R.A.F. you have
specially favourable terms of entry,
back-dated seniority, and every pos-
sible encouragement to make the
most of your potential. In the R.A.F.,
unlike civilian organisations, all the
top jobs have to be filled from within.
And as a graduate, you are in line for
promotion to the very highest ranks.
WHICH OF THESE
CAREERS IS RIGHT
FOR YOU?
Flying and executive? If this
attracts you, you should find out
more about the Flying Branch.
Engineering? In the Technical
Branch, the R.A.F. has vacancies
for electrical, electronic and mech-
anical engineers, to work on some of
the most highly developed equip-
ment in the world.
Teaching? In the R.A.F. you could
teach, according to your qualifica-
tions, at any level from G.C.E. to
post-Graduate. The R.A.F. Educa-
tion Officer is the focus of many
extra-mural activities.
Management? Much of the day-
to-day management of the R.A.F.
on the ground falls to the Equip-
ment and Secretarial Branches which
offer excellent careers to graduates.
Equipment officers are the logistics
experts, and deal with the planning,
supply and movement of all materiel
used by the R.A.F. throughout the
world. The Secretarial Branch is
concerned with general administra-
tion, personnel management, ac-
counting and intelligence.

contact the Secretory of your
Appointments Board or write,

your age, saying (if you can)

you, to—Group Captain J. W.

Soccer Report by Bob Grundy
WOOLWICH
W O E
LC. 1 Woolwich Poly 3
A FTER encouraging performances in their last three matches, I.C. were
looking forward to a win in their away game at Woolwich, who were
undefeated in the U.L. League this season.
I.C. kicked off and started at a fast
pace producing some good football.
They opened tne scoring when Hunt
made a good run and squared the ball
to Wideiski, whose shot was deflected
by a defender past the stranded goal-
keeper.
It was" unfortunate that I.C. did
not keep up the pressure, for Wool-
wich hit back almost immediately
when the centre-forward was left un-
marked and was allowed to score. This
goal seemed to infuse the I.C. team
with enthusiasm; shots from Smart and
Eastell went close but they could not,
in general, pierce the Woolwich rear-
guard.
Woolwich went ahead when, after a
mix up in the I.C, defence, th©
centre-forward was again left free
and proceeded to send Wojtowicz the
wrong way by shooting into the
corner of the net.
Mistimed Clearance
After the re-start, the game was more
even and Wellfair hit cross after cross
into the Woolwich goalmouth with no
net result. Both defences found the
surface treacherous, and it was to the
credit of both teams that mistakes
were comparatively few. However,
after I.C. conceded a free kick on
the half-way line Johnson completely
mistimed his clearance and the
Woolwich inside forward scored
easily from twelve yards. Although
I.C. tried hard to reduce the arrears
there was no further score.
This was a disappointing match for
I.C.; although the play was even, i'.
was their opponents who were more
direct in front of goal, and thus de-
served their win.
Cross Country
FRUSTRATION
^ [ O W T H A T we have our strongest 1st team for a couple of
years, the Cross Country was hoping to move up from its inevit-
able 6th place when the second league match of the season was held
at St. Mary's on November 3rd.
The team is, however, still
missing two of its runners through
injury and with the unusally high
standard in U . L . this year they
would have a har.l fight. Fast and
flat the 6 mile, St. Mary's course re-
quires accurate pace judgement and
over-eagerness at the beginning will
be paid for later though with 90
starters and a course very narrow at
points where extra speed may pay off
the problems are tricky indeed.
Final tally
Most runners managed to so've
these problems and recorded times
near their personal bests. First hone
was I.C. captain Howard Dickson
who, in spite of a time over 2 minutes
better than he did last year could
only come 27th. When the points
were all totalled up we were again in
6th place just behind Kings which
seems to be our fate in every race
these days.
We have two teams i n League 1,
and coming 13th out of 14 the 2nd
team will have to fight hard to avoid
the.long-impending drop to the lower
division.
Sub Aqua
W E E K E N D B E F O R E L A S T , Nov.
* * 6th and 7th, the Sub Aqua Club
organised two successful dives. One,
mainly for those new to the club, was
at Black Park near Slough. Although
the water was dark and very muddy,
a good dive was had by all.
The other dive was at Westwater in
the Lake District—here a depth of
160 ft. was reached in cold, clear
water. At this depth the divers were
effected by nitrogen which has a
similar effect to that of drink on the
surface. Some good photography was
done with the cameas taking the
pressure of 5 atmospheres without
trouble.
FFINE
FFETTLE
FFAGINS
FTER EIGHT matches this season
The Ffagins XV—I.C's. most at-
tractive rugby side, and one of Lon-
don's most prolific scorers—have
amassed 164 points and had only 33
points scored against them, amounting
to seven outright victories.
In spite of the fact that six of the
regular team have lost, or are about
to lose, their bachelorhood, the well
known Ffagin spirit of adventure '

ever dominant on and off the field of
play and at Beckenham (23-3), Read-
ing (6V3) and Port of London (26-0)
their displays will long be remem-
bered. Both Roslyn Park (6-3) and
Wasps (9-3) proved tougher fixtures
than last year but victories were
deserved.
Under the captaincy of Rex Parker
the team has remained consistent and
the pre-season signings of Barry Mair
and Ian Craig have proved a great
asset. Alan Davies, seen from side
elevation, has made many pleasing
runs; John Hall has yet to complete
a match at wing three quarter; Pete
Cunningham is determined and rugged
in the centre, and Derek Slack has
more than made up for the loss of
John Richardson at scrum-half.
The babes of the team—Parker, Mo-
Bain and Stewart—inject the essential
undergraduate keenness and stability
into the team, which might otherwise
be harmonic, hormonic and undisci-
plined.

P.S. We would like to announce the
engagement of Rex Parker, the
cantain of Ffaeins. to Miss Pat Rae.
