Educate or Bust
Professor Gabor at Wetlsoe
"YyiTHIN A few years engineering will have become an occu-
pational therapy, and the social effects of inventions and research
findings will have to be considered very carefully. Eventually the
world will have to adapt itself to economic stagnation, or there will
be total destruction.
Professor Gabor of the Electr.'cal
Engineering Dept, author of " Inven-
ing the Future," was talking to Wells
Soc. on " The problems of Science
and Engineering in the Fors sable
Future."
He started with a brief outline of
H . G . Wells' theories, and went on to
show how the approach to engineering
had changed since Wells' time, rela-
ting this to the changes he considers
to be necessary in the future.
Psychologically this world is used
to exponential increases, but it*must
soon slow down or go bust, and the
populus must be educated to a higher
level in order to occupy their in-
creasing leisure time in activities bene-
ficial to society. Complete co-opera-
tion at all levels is required for ad-
vancement towards a world more free
from crime and vice, and a world in
which people can work for their health
—both mental and physical—rather
than for their livelihoods.
Professor Gabor finished by giving
some examples of the kind of work
future engineers can do with an easy
conscience. Space and medical re-
search are the two major fields in
which advances can be made to the
benefit of the world as a whole, with-
out personal or commercial gains
biasing the projects.
Professor Gabor will be speaking to
Huxley Society in December on the
subject of " The threat and promise
of leisure in an automated society " —
it will be interesting to see how he
expands his ideas on this point.

For the first time since the Com-
munists seized power in 1949, two
students from mainland China have
entered the London School of Econo-
mics this year. They are taking a one
year general course.

Some students in a Manchester Hall of
Residence are suffering from an out-
break of nausea, vomiting and diar-
rhoea. The Public Health authorities
are investigating and the Hall has be-
gun a campaign to improve standards
in the kitchens.

This year's Annual General Meeting
of Nottingham University Union, in-
volving the election of 25 officers,
took a record short time of 20 minu-
tes, including the counting of the
votes—in previous years, this has
taken up io 2 days.

Brighton union are having a camr
paign to create a new-look healthy
student. They do not sell cigarettes
in their bar, thus imposing a half-
mile walk to a pub:

section of the University.

Both Chelsea College and North-
ampton College Union fees have been
raised this term, Chelsea's to 7 guineas
and Northampton's to 10 guineas.
Neither Union, however, seems very
sure about what they want the money
for.

People overloading lifts and causing
them to jam at the Northampton
College Hall of Residence are to be
charged for resetting the lift. As
this costs up to £25, it could become
rather an expensive pastime. This
action has been taken because the
lifts have been stuck seventeen times
so far this session.
Just One University Needed
" B R I T A I N O N L Y NEEDS one University."—This astonishing
statement was made by Peter Laslett, M.A., when he spoke in
the General Studies on 2nd November. He maintained that elec-
tronic communication systems can unite the universities of the
country into one nation-wide community.
We need to expand our university
system in a hurry if we are to keep
pace with America and Germany. A l -
ready we are an under-educated na-
tion. The only way to extend our
university facilities fast enough is to
put at the disposal of lecturers and
students all the advantages of elec-
ronic aids to teaching and learning.
Despite this, the idea of a " Univer-
sity of the air " is a fantasy. Quite
apart from the prohibitive cost (about
£40 million a year for an institution
the size of London University), it is
just not possible to " pipe " knowledge
continuously into students through the
medium of television. M r . Laslett
proposed that a nation-wide " open
system" university should use T.V.
for 5 per cent of the time, radio for
35 per cent, .and the rest of the teach-
ing done by correspondence course.
This sort of education, continued
throughout people's lives, was the only
way for the country to stay afloat in
a rapidly changing world.

STOMP SUCCESS
J T SEEMS a shame it the Jazz Club can put on a Southside Stomp
as successful as the one held a fortnight ago, that there are going
to be no more Stomps this term. I ask2(1 the President of the Jazz
Club whether this was due to a shortage of bands. He told me that
this was far from being the case
and that he had never seen so
many new groups able to play
to such a high standard so
quickly before. The reason was,
he said, that up until now it had
been impossible to hear any live,
" serious" jazz played to pro-
fessional standards within the
college, and that this was being
rectified at the next two Wednes-
day night meetings.
Tonight's (Nov. 17th) Concert
features "The Ken Gibson Big Band"
which was formed a few months ago,
and the Jazz Congress, which, you
may remember, played for the Jazz
and Poetry Session last year. Both
bands will be playing " arty " rather
than dance arrangements, and a really
interesting evening is promised. It
is being held in the Concert Hall and
begins at 8.00 p.m. Admission is
Is. 6d. for Jazz Club members and
2s. 6d. for non-members.
As to the Southside Stomps, they
will be back again next term. It is
hoped that by then all the other new
bands will be able to play as well as
the newly formed " Splinter Group "
and " I.C. Jump Band " which helped
to make the Morphy Day Stomp so
enjoyable.
