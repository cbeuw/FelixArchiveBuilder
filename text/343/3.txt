The following is taken from
the National Grants Briefing
Conference held at the Collegiate
Theatre in U C L on 13th October.
Delegates from IC were present
to state their case in the discus-
sion.
John Randall opened w!i!tih a speech
;
bringing delegates up to date with the
ongoing negotiations between the N U S ,
D E S and the S E D .
They have set up seven costing com-
mittees to thrash out the costs of the
N U S claims. These are as follows:
! 1. O n Discretionary Awards and itheir
Abolition.
This is a hopeful sign, as it is a
crack i n the D E S ' s wall of resistance
re abolition of discretionary awards.
The N U S has suggested that costing
-1
be considered im (three "tiers" o'r
groups:
i. mandatory awards for H N D or
degree-equivalents.
ii. mandatory awards to all 18 +
students.
Hi. mandatory awards to all 16 +
students.
A s regards i i i . this would include the
vast majority of Technical College
students. The majority of students
between 16 and 18 are not i n schools
but in Techs and F E colleges (many
people forget this).
The D E S does not appear to be in-
terested i n ithe abolition of the Dis-
cretionary A w a r d Scheme. However,
• it will be an advantage in presenting
the N U S case for abolition if we have
a real figure for the cost.
Legislation Will be needed to amend
the 1944 Education Act. There will
definitely be an amendment next
year, Ito provide a mandatory grant
for the D i p . H E (as proposed i n the
Govt. White iPaper). It is hoped that
if any legislative action is taken over
discretionary awards, it will be taken
at this time.
Another encouraging action on this
front is that L E A ' s will be able to
recover 90% of itheir expenditure on
mandatory awards from 1st A p r i l ,
1973. In theory, they can now be
more generous with discretionary
awards. (Hitherto, ithey could only
recoyer 60% of their expenditure).
2. The Cost of abolition of discrimina-
tion against married women students
has been established as
(a) £l-^m. if ithey a l l received the
"at-home" grant (about £390).
(b) ,£3m. if they all received the
"away-from-home" grant (£520).
Linked to this is the question of de-
pendants' allowances. The D E S
policy (Which was laid (before the
House of Commons two days be-
fore the recess) lis that £250 per week
should be paid for ithe academic year,
and during the vacations, the claim-
ant has to go to the D H S S Hike any-
one else.
This amounts to £4.81 per week i n
term-time.
A campaign around this issue is Ito
be run, within the Grants Campaign,
•to involve women i n local Colleges,
it is hoped that there will be a meet-
ling between N U S Exec, and Union
Welfare Officers shortly.
3. A new award system for students
studying abroad.
Students studying in foreign coun-
tries often run out of money before
the end of their courses because of
currency exchange fluctuations and
high cost of living in some foreign
countries.
The D E S wants an administratively
Simple system; perhaps banding to-
gether several countries under a par-
ticular rate of grant. The D E S has
provided some cost-of-living figures
for some foreign countries, particu-
larly E E C countries. The N U S posi-
tion is that no student abroad should
receive less than the London grant,
and -that it should be paid i n one
of two ways:
(a) the grant should be paid termly,
with adjustment for exchange
fluctuations and high cost of
living in same foreign countries,
(b) the grant should be paid i n the
appropriate foreign currency at
the start of the academic year.
A s for overseas students, there is
little chance, it seems, of abolishing
the 3-year residence qualification.
The only movement here is the pos-
sibility of students living i n the E E C
may receive mandatory awards.
iv. Abolition of the Means Test.
Various approximate figures of the
cost have appeared over 'the past
five years; they range from £6m.
(NUS) to £20m. (DES). NU)S has/
pointed out that withdrawal of tax
allowance for parents with children
receiving grants would partly offset
the cost of abolition. The D E S has
been "co-operative" i n these negotia-
tions, but the Inland Revenue Ser-
vice has been distinctly stroppy, and
refuses to give up the relevant fig-
ures to N U S .
v. Giving cash grants to College of
E d . students
The D E S instituted a Pilolt Scheme
i n ten Colleges a few years back, but
appears to have gone off the idea
now. They are now saying that they
have commitment to introduce cash
grants and want to introduce subsi-
dies to cover the losses incurred i n
College of Education Halls and cat-
ering. The N U S Executive therefore
considers it unwise to continue link-
ing this claim to the Pilot Scheme
and plan to raise ithe question in
general negotiations.
vi. Raising the main rate.
This is ithe most difficult costing, in-
cluding, as it does, the assessment of
the notional element for board and
lodging. Hitherto this has been taken
as the average of hall rents. This is,
of course, misleading, because hall
rents are largely dependent on sub-
sidies, " h i d d e n " or otherwise. The
withdrawal of which may lead to
sudden rises. Furthermore, as re-
gards "digs", ithe retail price index
only measures the cost of unfurn-
ished accommodation, the cost of
which rises much more slowly than
the cost of furnished accommodation.
Hence, the cost of all student accom-
modation is to be taken into account
in these present negotiations.
Equipment grants are also being dis-
cussed i n this context.
vii. Students on long courses.
This includes health students, and
postgraduates.
Health students may be studying for
44 to 48 weeks every year, but only
receive the notional element for
board and lodging for the extra
weeks (14-18 weeks). These students
have no opportunity to work during
the holidays, (only 4 weeks). The
N U S case is that they should receive
the full grant for all 44-48 weeks.
Paramedical students (manual hos-
pital workers, etc.) are included i n
the section (i), as they receive dis-
cretionary awards.
Ft appears that no-one i n the D E S
knows how the P G grant is assessed;
this may be one reason why there
has been no action from them on it!
The N U S has suggested that it be
assessed in one of two ways:
i. as for other long-course students,
(ii) part or whole of a recent gradu-
ate's salary; 7 5 % has been raised
as a figure.
The most significant point, however,
lis that N U S has little or no policy
on the postgraduate grant. A n y
ideas?
There are a few other areas which
have been discussed:
(a) Field Trips
The N U S has taken the line that in
term-time, Students should receive
a certain amount of money to de-
fray, extra costs incurred by a field
trip. During vacations a l l the ele-
ments i n the grant should be inclu-
ded i n the sum given, instead of just
board, lodgings and travel.
Note: The U G C gives each institu-
tion a certain amount to sub-
sidise field trips, from a cen-
tral pool. It is likely that I C
is one College that benefits
from this scheme,
(ib) The Triennial Review
One of N U S ' s demands to go to the
1973-74 Triennial Review is the
abolition of the Triennial Review,
This, N U S feels, should be replaced
by an annual review of student fin-
ance. A questionnaire to be sent out
to 10 institutions on a proposed pilot
for the N U S scheme is to be pre-
pared by the D E S .
(c) Delay in Ithe payment of grants.
This year it was caused by L E A ' s
'being forced to recalculate the grant
levels because of the changes i n the
means test. N U S hopes to speed up
the Triennial Review this year so
that it doesn't drag on into the sum-
mer, and delay the payment of the
(higher?) grant.
The Campaign
None of the D E S - N U S negotiations
carry any commitments from either side.
A t the end of the negotiations, the politi-
cal decisions Will be taken in D E S -
Treasury infighting. N U S Executive be-
lieves that it is at this point that the
Campaign must be strongest—we must
apply our political weight to produce
the right decision; hence the campaign
should build up to the Review, and if
necessary, carry on beyond it.
Steve Parry spoke on the campaign.
H e pointed out Itihat the campaign must
be carried out to 'back the negotiations
and i n conjunction With Trade Unions
and other groups on low and fixed in-
comes, e.g. pensioners and claimants.
After Margate, activity should be
built up on an area basis during the
second term. A c t i o n should be taken
around L E A meetings, etc., and culmi-
nate in a massive demonstration at a
significant juncture i n the Triennial Re-
view.
k is hoped that areas will commence
action on students rights i n conjunction
Wiith the Grants campaign.
In IC
We would hope to do several things
this term:
i. Inform students, particularly fresh-
ers, about the grants campaign.
ii. Raise the level of consciousness
enough to provide ithe semblance of
a mass mobilisation in the College.
iii. Pave the way for a n effective rent
strike next term, a crucial period.
iv. Partake in the area campaign, a n d
provide some effective assistance to
smaller Colleges i n the area.
The major argument o n Saturday was
the posing of national vs. local actions.
M y feeling is that any -action, local
or national depends on the effectiveness
of local student union officers. It is up
to the Union Executive to organise a n
effective campaign, and Ito mobilise sfu*
dents to enter the campaign. It is often
very useful to capitalise on feeling over
local issues, e.g. refectory prices, and use
these to show the nature of the grants
situation ito Government Economic pol-
icy and the affect it has o n students and
others on low and fixed incomes.
I hope that there Will be some cam-
paigning with outside groups:
i. Trades Union via Hammersmith
Council.
ii. Pensioners; how about some cam-'
paigning for them?
iii. Claimants.
iv. Tenants' Associations.
Dates to Remember:—
October 24th or 25th: A r e a action.
Proposed: brief rally, then march to a n d
picket of L E A Action on discretionary
awards.
November 7ih: National Rally.
November 14th: W o r k - i n (and PrirH
cess Anne's wedding day).

Committee of Vice-Chancellors
and Principals show support for
higher grants
... but words don t pay hills
At its meeting this morning the Vice-Chanceilors' Committee dis-
cussed the issue of student grants against the background of the re-
view currently being conducted by the Department of Education and
Science to determine the grant levels for the three years commencing
next autumn.
It has been the declared policy of successive Governrrents over
many years since the Anderson Committee reported, that subject to
a parental means test, grants should be available to cover the reason-
able basic maintenance costs of undergraduate students. This is the
Anderson principle. But in recent years, Governments have begun
to threaten this principle by fixing grants which fall short of basic
living costs.
Universities are hit by
the decreasing value in
student grants i n two ways.
In the first place, students
ought to have the basic
means to support them-
selves so that their studies
are not adversely affected.
In the second place, if uni-
versities are to continue to
try to house students and
prevent a crisis in accom-
modation, they must be
able to fix rents which
meet the cost of providing
accommodation w h i c h
now has to be financed
principally through loans
raised on the open money
market. Equally students
living in lodgings must be
able to pay rent at ithe
going rate.
The Committee's con-
cern about student grants
has become more acute
over the last two years.
When the D E S announced
press release
the levels that were to
apply for the three aca-
demic years 1971-74, the
Committee said that in-
adequate grants were in-
consistent with the Gov-
ernment's policy which
required universities to
make economic charges
for board and lodging.
Over the past year the
s t u d e n t s ' grievances
against the Government
about the declining pur-
chasing power of their
grant took the form of
rent strikes and protest
action directed against
universities. Although the
universities sympathised
wilth the students' difficul-
ties, they were bound to
tell their students that they
could not provide wide-
ranging subsidies from
funds voted by Parliament
for the primary purposes
of teaching and research.
Student protest action dir-
ected against universities is
misconceived. It wastes
time and money on con-
flicts which are not created
by universities and which
are not in their power to
resolve.
The D E S review of stu-
dent grants for the three
years from nc::t Septem-
ber is now under way. T h e
Committee believes that
the Anderson principle is
at stake. It is essential that
student grants should be
properly assessed, fixed in-
itially at realistic levels
and between reviews sup-
plemented annually to
take account of changing
prices. The Committee has
already made its general
Views known to Ministers
and proposes to make fur-
ther representations as the
review proceeds.
