A l m o s t each week this

The question is w h o

W e s a y with complete

built in this a n d a l l

then f a s c i s m will be i m -

In closing I w o u l d like
to remind everyone of
tha slogans of the IUa-
t'onal Front, shouted in
their m a r c h during the
summer: " H a n g a l l stu-

It's that sort of a
future in store for u s or

FUNNY
ONE ONE
Dear Editor,
Thank G o d there is one
sane compassionate hum-
an being here who can un-
derstand other's sexual
problems. N o w that our
G a y Brothers are being
liberated it is time to turn
our 'attention to 'that other
sadly repressed minority
beaten down by the Fascist
vanguard of capitalistic
narrow minded society
(thank God)! I a m talking
about Sado-Masochis'ts.
There is no reason why a
man's relationship with his
whip cannot be just as
loving as that with an-
other human being. A lot
of sado-masoehists are far
more normal than so call-
ed human beings. Anyone
interested i n sado-maso-
chism drop around to m y
torture chamber sometime
and talk it over, over a red
hot poker.

Rent Strikes
Bristol, Liverpool and
Central London Poly are
on rent strike, P C L since
January; they now have
£22,000 in their rent strike
fund.
Kent and others have
passed motions i n U G M s .
About three have decided
not to, mainly because
they have a'ready been on
strike and fc't that they
were not backed by other
colleges and N U S Exec,
strongly enough. This
shows the effect of solid-
arity action. Reading,
Exeter and Y o r k are not
going on strike.
it shou'd be noted that
the effect of the campaign
w i s to squeeze an extra
£20 from M r s . Thatcher.
There are, at present,
two lines on rent strike,
one of which will be
chosen at Margate:

We played our first
league gam." on Saturday,
13th October against
Kodak. Play was scrappy
at first but I.C: soon began
pressurising the K o d a k
goa! and eventually forced
a short corner. Mick
Downes netted from the
short and we went l-O up.
Kodak's negative play
continued but they scored
just on half time, i n the
second half several defen-
sive mistakes gave Kodak
their second goal. Imperial
again put on the pressure
and Mick Downes netted
his second goal.
After another frustrat-
ing period Dave Harrison
and Nigel Woodhouse
combined together to pro-
duce c r third and best
goal, Nise! being t h e
scorer. I.C. then clamped
dewn in defence and we
ran out winners 3-2. O u r
thanks to G . Popple who
umpired.
The Imperials teams
were selected from: R.

PURPLE PATCH
A t the Union General
meeting on Tuesday the
16th October, two deci-
sions were made, both of
which bear a reasonable
amount of relevance to
the students in this college.
The first of these two
motions was that this
Union demands that the
governing body remove
the 5 per cent increase
which they have put on
the refectory prices, and
make good the loss on'the
refectories by subsidising
them from non refectory
profits. T h e second deci-
sion which was made was
that the Entertainments
committee should be re-
stricted to having three
concerts per term, unless
the S.C.A B. committee
sanction another concert
for one reason or another.
This second decision
enables the Entertain-
ments committee to pro-
vide reasonable entertain-
ment for the students of
this college, and at the
same time limits the num-
ber of concerts they are
allowed to put on.
A s far as the refectories
motion is concerned, the
meeting asked that the
Board of Governors re-
move the increase that
they suggested last term
and that t l v subsidise the
refectories from non-refec-
tory sources, thus break-
ing the U . G . C . ruling that
they should in no circum-
stances subsidise the refec-
tories, but that the refec-,
tones, should be totally
self-financing. In order to
implement this policy and
to force the board of
governors to accept our
demands, we should set up
change tables i n each of
the refectories, and from
these should p r o v i d e
people with the accurate
change which they require
so that they c a n pay last
year's prices for the food
which they are about to
eat. Thus the people
would look down last
year's price list, and then
offer the old amount of
money to the lady .behind
the cash desk, and refuse
to pay her any more.
When this motion was
put forward, I spoke
against it on similar lines
to those which I put for-
ward i n F E L I X ' two
weeks ago. During the
discussions last term with
the refectories committee
and also the Board of
Governors, we were told
that it was estimated that
the overall loss at the end
of the session 1973/74
would be in the region of
£35,000 unless the prices
in the refectories were i n -
creased. Part of this in-
crease could be offset by
including the net surplus
of around £11,500 from
the Bars and the cellars
thus leaving an overall
deficit of some £23,500.
This could be offset by an
increase of 7\ per cent,
and would need a sub-
stantial amount of the re-
fectories surplus to help
the finances out thus
limiting the amount of
much needed decorating
The board of governors
decision was that the
refectory prices should be
increased by 5 per cent
(i.e. to everyone including
the staff, and also those
persons ordering dinners
etc.). This would then
leave us to find some
extra money from some-
where, and it was decided
to find this money from
some of the Rector's
funds, this money to go
towards certain types of
rcdecoration of the refec-
tory areas.
A t a Grant's action
committee (G.A.C.) last
Thursday evening, about
30/40 R . S . M . students
turned up to express their
disapproval of the decision
taken by the U . G . M .
A . G . A . C . decision was
taken that the meeting
should adjourn and that it
would not reconvene until
the 14th December. It was
also decided that at the
next Union meeting, a
Constitution of the G . A . C .
should be drawn up, and
approved, so that the
G . A . C . would have some
framework on which it
could work. ( N . B . T h e
R . S . M . had a U n i o n meet-
ing on the same day as the
I.C. Union meeting at
which they decided that
the R . S . M . would not sup-
port the Rent strike. Dur-
ing the next couple of
weeks both R.C.S. and
also C . & G , are having
Union meetings at which
they will both discuss the
Rent strike motion and
also t h e Refectories
motion. I would hope that
as many people turn up to
the next I.C. Union meet-
ing as will turn up to the
-three C . C . U . Union meet-
ings ! ! !
There are many other
issues which I would like
to discuss in this Patch,
but unfortunately neither
time nor space will permit
this. Some of these would
be:—
1 Departmental meet-
ings with the Sabbatical
officers plus C . C . U . Presi-
dent.
2 Profiles of certain of
the Union and College
officials in Felix..
3 Better use of the P.A.
System in College Block
before U . G . M ' s .
4 Restructuring of the
U . G . M ' s b y : —
Limiting the speeches to
three minutes; Guillotine
of 75 minutes on the meet-
ing; More motions at
U . G . M ' s referring to our
own problems; Decisions
on N.U.S. Policies to be
taken b y the External
affairs committee.
It was suggested that all
of these ideas would be
discussed at the next meet-
ing of Council. They were
proposed by a working
party on Publications and
publicity last week.
Just before I finish, I
would like to inform
everyone that at a Board
of Governor's Finance and
Executive c o m m i t t e e
meeting on Friday of last
week, it was decided that
the Union should receive
an extra £5,000 on top of
the subvention which they
receive at the moment. If
anyone feels that the
Governing body are really
against us then they could
possibly try to explain this
one to me. (Maybe even
someone will dream up
the idea of using this
money to subsidise the
refectories rather than
using the money out of
the student's pockets!).
N o r m
(a) Continue the present
situation where support
and encouragement for
locally initiated rent
strikes is given, and (b)
Call for a National Rent
Strike.

Those present (from
Q M C , Central Poly, North
London Poly, Redbridge,
City, London and IC) told
the meeting what they had
on this term.
The meeting discussed
problems which had arisen
out of agents, etc. N o
concrete decision w a s
taken.
A n all night event was
proposed for 23rd Novem-
ber at City who had a l -
ready booked two groups.
Q M C agreed to bring in
their group for that night.
IC agreed to sell tickets.
We also got the impres-
sion that other colleges
were rather jealous of our
reputation in the field of
entertainments.
City University have an
idea for a large event at
the Agricultural Hall,
which has not been used
for years and needs ex-
tensive renovation, for
about 17,000 p e o p l e .
Names suggested were
Jelferson Airplane and
Pink Floyd.
The meeting closed with
a resolution to meet again
at Hatfield and put a
motion on agencies and
the legality of contracts to
