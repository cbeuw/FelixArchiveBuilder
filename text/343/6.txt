BOOKS
Who's who in the Ancient World
by Betty Radice Penguin 60p
This book is what is says it is, or to
be more exact a 'who was who" in the
Greek and R o m a n classics.
Our heritage of art is full of the in-
fluences both historical and mythologi-
cal from this era, the mythology of the
time especially presenting an amazing
flux of fascinating characters w h o led
very complex lives by any standards
and w h o are further confused by the
various interpretations made over a
thousand years of the Greek and Roman
cultures.
Betty Radice presents a very clear
picture of what could be chaos and
what is perhaps more important follows
the strong classical influences over a
vast range of art, from the Renaissance
to the present day, spanning poetry,
painting, sculpture, music, playwriting,
films, philosophy and even astronomy
and psychoanalysis — enabling one to
interpret the significance of the sym-
bols and characters involved in them.
The comprehensive and fully up to
date index makes a l l the information
in the dictionary readily accessible, and
this book is ideal for reference or for a
confirmed browser, being full of inter-
esting snatches of information which
you run across upon looking up a par-
ticular topic such as Freud's Elektra
complex, Picasso's use of the Minotaur
or the population of the circles of H e l l
in Dante's Inferno, to name but a few.
There are 56 rather beautiful black
and white plates illustrating introduc-
tion, a bibliography, two maps and a
chronological table finish of the book.
Recommended.

" T h e Best of Private E y e " — that's
a bit of a libel. (What happened to the
Cloggies, for one thing — and Pseud's
Corner and Barry McKenzie?'. it's not
the best — it's more like a random
sample picked out from the last couple
of years. Y o u could say it is exceedingly
boring. The usual hate figures get their
share of paper darts. Some of it is child-
ish and self-indulgent (anything's funny
if you hear it often enough, often enough
. . . often enough . . . get it?) and some
already seems dated; about as useful
and interesting as a collection of vintage
potato crisps. Some, of course, is very
funny indeed:

alan Tightly (Lady-in-Waiting); H . R . H .
Duke of Edinburgh.
Well, you either like it or you don't.
But unless you're an incurable addict
(remember, it can damage your
health) this is not a book to buy. It's
worth the odd look in the shops, though;
you might get a laugh or two.
Y AUTOBIOGRAPHY
by Charles Chaplin
The title is " M y Autobiography", a n d
it is. Chaplin's writing is as personal
and as dead-pan as his camera-work;
What he saw, felt and thought is here,
stated so baldly that you sometimes
wonder if the book is a translation.
The memories near the beginning, and
the- anecdotes in the rest of the book,
are strung along apparently at random
and it was not until 1 had been carried
through several scenes that 1 became
conscious of the easy directness of his
approach. This is the essence of Chap-
lin, in p, int. and with it comes the
realisation that in his private life he
was an artist and by no means the
clown and tramp.
A s a child he Knew extreme poverty,
but does not fall into the trap of glorify-
ing it: "1 found poverty neither attrac-
tive nor edifying. It taught me nothing
n.ore than a distortion of values, an
overrating of the virtues and graces of
the rich and the so-called better classes".
He toured America with the Karno
Company, and later reiurned there full
of hopes and dreams to distill the inimi-
table tramp. The story cf that process
is one which most of us, as s.udents,
will hope to parallel. '
,
Chaplin was 21 when he first saw
Broadway and New Y o r k and his des-
criptions of those places and of his feel-
ings for them would fit many freshers
coming to London for the first time:
the distractions, impersonality, impetu-
osity a n d occasional beauty of a big
city and a legend. More than anything
else, this feeling of identity and compre-
hension draws one into sympathy with
him. Also thought provoking are his
comments on the attitudes and postur-
ing of the press and the American bu-
reaucratic system.
In its early chapters, the book is full
of memories of London before the First
World War — habits and a. way of life
now totally lost. There is material here
for the sociologist and historian, as well
as interest for the casual browser. Later,
the book becomes more anecdotal, is full
of well-worn names, some new old gos-
sip and characteristic snatches of homely
philisophy, yet remains readable and
absorbing. The pictures, and there are
113 of them, tend to be blurry period
prints a n d newspaper snaps, but they
fit, and give valuable glimpses of the
surroundings and social strata through
which Charlie gravitated.
A n y Chaplin-fans, film-fanatics and
devoted nostaigists will have snapped
up the first printing: if you want to
knew rao.e about the man behind the
clown and be given an absorbing view
of the world "as it was" into the bargain,
try this snip at 65p. "After a l l —
(P.320) — "there are more valid facts
and details in works of art than there
are in history books".

Almost free theatre
Nowadays lunchtime drama is becom-
ing very popular i n London, attract-
ing an audience from office workers and
the urban populace that cannot stay i n
town late just to see a play. The Almost
Free Theatre is one theatre running a
series of lunchtime plays, and I went to
see Instrument for Love by Jennifer
Phillips, which is running at 1.15 p.m.
(except Sundays) until October 27th.
The theatre auditorium i s very small
so that an intimate relationship is main-
tained between the actors and the audi-
ence which is exploited by the cast
very well so that the audience actually
feels that they are a n integral part of
the action and not just passive obser-
vers.
The play itself is about four people
who snatch a picnic on the lawn outside
an open house during the interval. T h e
party consists of M r . and M r s . Drew,
their fed up daughter, and a guest who
later transpires just to be a friend of
the original guest who could not make it
at the last minute. A s the play progresses
we find out that M r s , Drew was the
organiser and the only person that really
wanted to see the opera. F o r the other
three it is only a social drudgery that
must be borne out and it i s remarkable
how little i s ever said about the opera,
as the parity are too involved with them-
selves. It also transpires that M r . Harper
(the guest) is really a "dirty old m a n " ,
who cannot come to terms with himself
unless he regularly indulges i n his hobby
of making obscene phone calls and is
much put off when the voice at the other
end is not indignant but inviting. Miss
Drew turns out to be a sexually "liber-
ated g i r l " Who prefers action t o con-
versation and the silent M r . Drew makes
his own revolutionary stand against his
wife by refusing the cordon bleu picnic
w i t h . champagne for the preferable
corned beef sandwich and pale ale. T h e
overall effect is the humorous creation
of a very realistic situation that we have
all found ourselves i n at one social func-
tion or another. The play was directed
by Liane A u k i n , who has managed to
handle the production with great sensi-
tivity and nothing is overdone so the
whole effect is realistic rather than
absurd. Notable performances were
given by Gillian Martell as the trendy
mum and David Glover as the sex-
crayed guest.
The play was produced by Interaction,
who are a group experimenting i n a l l
forms of art and communications for
use at community level, and with this
play they have produced a very good
drama production that will appeal to
lunchtime audiences, especially as there
are no fixed prices, but you just pay
what you want to. T i m Jeffes
