CROSS I DUN FRY CLUB l l "u'.Jub.'*.,
»ne of those interesting stories
After last week's report you prob-
ably gained the impression that a large
field was expected at the 2nd U L Cross
Country Trial. In fact there were only
36 runners: maybe the others were put
off by the previous muddle (or perhaps
they don't exist). The fact that U L were
Without any organisation was again the
cause of some dashing about by some
people and some standing around i n
the cold by others. First of all, it was
generally decided that we'd do the 5
rather than the 6 mile course, and we
were about to start when it wasn't a good
idea because the course wasn't marked
and half the people wouldn't know the
way. Now, by coincidence, there were
two other iraces at Parliament H i l l that
afternoon and we somehow co-opted
one of their courses which was well
marked. Someone then went round the
course so he could describe it. Past gems
of course-description here have included
'Go round the tree that isn't there",
and "It's the same as the 1938 National
course"; this year it was " D o n ' t go
round the Extension," whatever that
was.
So, somewhat colder, we set off and
found our way round two laps totalling
about 5J miles. R i c h a r d Garnett and
Rob Allinson were tenth equal i n about
32 minutes, followed by Ian Ellis (12th),
Kaliray (14th) and Dave West (15th).
The rest of us were well spread over the
remaining finishers with Pad bringing
up the rear despite a 6 minute improve-
ment over a similar distance last week.
Unfortunately N e i l Boag arrived too late
to r u n having been trapped by B R i n
a locked u p station.
After the race we set off for the sta-
tion via Greasy Joe's Tea and Chess
Emporium, and, after waiting for a lift
for some time Ian Ellis decided (dis-
playing typical Cross Country C l u b lead-
ership) to open the gates of one of the
lifts already waiting at the top landing,
and we and other people got i n . U p o n
all this activity a nailman appeared and
offered his estimate of how long we'd
have to wait for the lift to move, so
everybody got out again.
O n Wednesday we went to Richmond
Park. There's not m u c h to say about
this because nothing went wrong. We
went round our course (each at his own
pace: and many and varied these were),
and arrived back i n time to play on the
swings while waiting for the coach.
Next week Inquests on the U C Relay
and the League Race, and Ian Isher-
wood's explanation of why he's still not
running.

HOCKEY CLUB!
A rather depleted 2nd X I played the
first match of the season away against
l.'.C. 2nds on Saturday. After recruit-
ing players from 1st and 3rd X I s
(thanks to Andrew, Jerry and Richard)
ten individuals invaded 5th Kensington
underground complete with sticks and
other assorted weapons, so beginning
the marathon journey to Shenley.
The game got underway with some
intelligent and positive play by a l l
members of the team. U . C . were con-
tained i n itheir own half, and although
shots at goal were not i n abundance, a
well taken goal, from deep i n the ' D ' ,
struck by M i k e Hatcher gave us a de-
served 1-0 lead at half time. After the
break, however, the team seemed to fall
apart with U . C . forwards finding ample
room to score three goals Ito seal our
fate.
After the match U . C . showed a
marked lack of hospitality, and—more
important—a marked lack of jugs. So it
was a generally p d off team that
returned to I.C.
A word of encouragement to fresh-
ers !to show up on Saturdays (at 1.00
p.m. in the union) if you want your tal-
ents to be recognised. It lis good to have
your subs but better 2nd team results
necessitate • regular turn out.

JUDO CLUB
I.C.'s Judo C l u b only came back into
existence last year—so naturally, it is
still a very new club, and continuously
undergoing the process of change and
development, eventually we hope into a
very prominent and successful club.
We have had many of last year's
club members return to form a nucleus
for this year. We have also had over
28 newcomers with a range of experience
from white belt to black. A s at ithe be-
ginning of any year, there is also a lot
of interest from prospective beginners
who may well join on having had a n
introduction to judo.
During this first term we hope to
organise several demonstration/friendly
competition events with other college
clubs in U L U , to which anybody inter-
ested—if only to watch—is very wel
come. Then after Christmas things will
become more serious as we enter 'full-
blooded' competitions (not too much
blood we hope!), and with a little luck
take off some trophies.
W e will be very pleased at any time
to welcome new members (from begin
ners to black belts). The club practises
every Tuesday and Thursday evening,
starting at 6.30 p.m., i n the U n i o n G y m
with two black belt instructors.

Wednesday, 10th October saw 'the
start of a new season. Imperial, under
the delusion of playing Brunei 1st X I ,
played within themselves i n the first
half and at half time the score was 2-0.
M i c k Dovvnes then informed us we were
playing Brunei 2nd X I and we composed
ourselves accordingly and ran out win-
ners 7-0. The scorers were G . Popple
(3 + 1 jus), M . Downes (2) and K.
Ross (2).
Wednesday evening was also Pie and
M a s h night. It was a night enjoyed by
everyone especially Nigel Woodhouse,
who still has to learn to count, and T i m
Hanson who had swimming lessons in a
Selkirk Bath. W e wish to thank every-
one for supporting the occasion.

TIDDLEY WINK RACE
The traditional Tiddlely W i n k Race
down Oxford Street was once again a
great success.
The winner was Mines Fresher Jamie
'Blur' Bell. H e led i n great style, leading
the Mines contingent to victory, and was
accorded an exclusive interview on
S T O I C .
O n a 'per capita' basis Mines once
collected more than either of the other
constituent Colleges, and a total of £420
was collected.
The hard work and fun realised i n
this event can ibe judged by the number
of students hobbling around over the
weekend.
N o arrests were made, a good start.

MORPHY DAY OCTOBER 24th
In 1920 A r t h u r M o r p h y presented
Imperial College with a cup to be rowed
for by the Constituent Colleges. The
race was started from s'takeboats and
raced in Eights from Hammersmith
Bridge to the University Stone at Putney
Bridge.
Competition for the M o r p h y first
eights was so strong that in 1945 Colonel
Lowry, then the secretary of the Col-
lege, introduced the L o w r y C u p for
second eights. It is a regrettable fact
that puny C and G have managed to
crawl home first 39 times, Mines 8
times and R C S , being gentlemen, have
considerately exerted their authority a
mere 6 times.
This year C & G have fielded an eight
which is probably the fastest in Britain.
They have six international oarsmen and
the rest are made'up of national cham-
pions. The R C S crew have most of
the I C first eight, and Mines are also
competing.
After the second war the Stakeboat
starts were replaced by free starts and
then i n 1960 the course was shortened
to 2,500 metres from Harrods Deposi-
tory to the University Stone.
PaSt tow path battles include a mock
funeral with coffins carried by C & G
and R C S , complete with police escort
across Putney Bridge and down the E m -
bankment to I C Boathouse. City and
Guilds have now ordered their usual
five hundredweight of flour, but it is
rumoured that Mines, with an unusual
display of intelligence, have phoned up
the company and diverted the cargo into
their own coffers, at C G's expense.
Did you know that R C S has won the
towpath battle twenty-six times (once
with the help of Mines) and the score
stands the same with C & G ? Come on
R C S (I try not to be biased), we need
that Morphy Day Mascot, and for the
Miners, i n case you'd forgotten, it's a
sawn-off oar. /
