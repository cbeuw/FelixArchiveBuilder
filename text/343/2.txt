ITERS
Dear Friends,
A s one w h o is not a student, but a worker in a
university b o o k s h o p in L o n d o n , I w o u l d be m o s t
grateful if y o u w o u l d a l l o w m e the use of your
c o l u m n s to make an appeal to your readers.
A group of people in Phoenix, Arizona are at-
tempting to raise funds to buy m e d i c a l material
for those workers in Chile w h o are in armed c o n -
flict with the military regime. T h e following is
part o f a letter from this group w h i c h w a s pub-
lished by the A n a r c h i s t paper " F r e e d o m " in the
issue dated 2 9 . 9 . 7 3 :
" M o n e y is urgently needed by C h i l e a n workers,
students a n d radicals. A s w e k n o w A l l e n d e is
dead, along w i t h 5,000 of his fellow workers.
Students, workers are still w a g i n g fierce battles
against junta troops. W o r k e r s have taken over
factories a n d are still p r o d u c i n g — w h i l e being
b o m b e d by junta planes! W o r k e r s in V a l p a r a i s o
surprised junta groups a n d re-captured half the
town. Soldiers a n d low-level officers in the south
of Chile are grouping w i t h a r m e d radical groups
of w o r k i n g people a n d m o v i n g towards Santiago.
The junta military invaded the University o f San-
tiago a n d murdered hundreds of students. Leftists
and supporters are being r o u n d e d up a n d s u m m a r -
ily shot. Political e x i l e s — a r o u n d 3 0 0 — i n C h i l e
have been rounded Up a n d s h o t . "
(I think there c o u l d be some doubt as to the
accuracy of classifying A l l e n d e as a worker, b u t
I think in the context of this appeal that is neither
here nor there.)
Upon reading this I sent the group a letter re-
questing further information, as events in Chile
were moving at a rapid pace, a n d their reply, in
part, is a s follows:
" A t present (letter dated 6.10.73) information
o n the junta takeover is vague. O n e important
aspect is the growing boldness of 'respectable'
journalistic purveyors within Chile w h o are step-
p n g a little more heavily o n the toes of print
censorship by writing more of t h e reality inside
than the junta feels is necessary. A m e r i c a n news
sources are speaking less t i m i d l y . W e ' v e learnt
more o f the slaughter, round-ups, tortures, intimi-
dations, book burnings, etc., from big established
newspapers n o w . A t first they w e r e silent, n o w
they're speaking louder. Of course, w e don't ex-
pect them to encourage armed revolution or to
ag.tate the U . S . Government to c o n d e m n a n d not
recognize the usurpers. I think the point at w h i c h
the U . S . Press kissed a little less a s s w a s w h e n
news of growing, sanctioned a n t i - S e m i t i s m came
out. ' E l M u r c u r i o ' — t h e right-wing p a p e r — p r i n t e d
a letter, very prominently, w h i c h cast A l l e n d e
a j a c o g in the ' J e w C o m m u n i s t C o n s p i r a c y ' a n d
c o n c l u d e d by urging a pogrom of Chilean J e w s .
The author wanted, as succour, ' a J e w hanging
from every lamp-post in Santiago'. T h i s , the inci-
dents of book burning by the army a n d eye-
witnes to torture a n d s u m m a r y execution, so
reminiscent of Hitler (among others) seemed to
make the big shot news publishers uneasy. Conse-
quently, more news is c o m i n g from these agen-
cies. M y o w n news sources are from A s i a N e w s
Service, Presna Latina, Inter N e w s Service a n d
N A C L A . W e plan to issue a pamphlet or news
s u m m a r y o f the events within t w o weeks. A t the
moment, information on contacts, financial dis-
persion, etc. is vague—rather, w e are still nutur-
ing our leads. W e ' r e trying to co-ordinate (if our
immediate contacts fail) relief work w i t h a group
in Berkeley, California. W e anticipate a long
period of waiting for strong, reliable contacts to
d e v e l o p — b u t w e ' r e optimistic. If h o w e v e r , all
avenues e r e unsuccessfully exhausted, we'll i n -
form eacn contributor a n d either refund the con-
tribution or use it e l s e w h e r e . "
There is very little students or workers in this
country can do at the present time to directly
assist the Chilean workers but supporting this
fund does make some contribution to their strug-
gle. Please send a l l m o n e y a n d information o n
further contacts in Chile or Argentine to: D A R I O

D e a r E d ,
This year we are hoping

Office area, and we would
appreciate any offers of
help, especially with stap-
ling i n the evening, and
with distribution.
A n y notices should be
in the U.S.K. pigeon hole
by Tuesday lunohtimes—if
you have any information
on Events, 'please send it
in. W e also need contacts
in the other colleges
roundabout, if anyone
knows of anyone "outside"
who would be interested
in helping, would they
please drop us a line.
Thanks, and d o drop by,
Chris and Paul.

DAY
Dear Editor,
I feel (often), as Presi-
dent of the Royal School
of Mines, that I should
warn all those bumpkins
and general scrape-the-
barrel slag who intend to
oppose us on Morphy
Day (See and Pee and
arse-ease-rest are the
technical descriptions of
the enemy): that we shall
win. That we shall take
no prisoners. Rape, plun-
der and loot are our bat-
tle orders, and the safest
thing for them is to keep
their life insurance poli-
cies intact and slink
quietly from the battle-
field.
The oar will be ours,
and our ladies rowing
eight will win, while our
ever-victorious Rugby
team crushes in turn
their opponents on some
far-flung field.
Remember you have
been warned. We have
already won, our fire-
power is invincible, our
crack troops will not
waver. Heed not the call
to battle of your presi-
dents, you alone will be
the one to suffer.
Paul Gee.
NOT
FOOLED
Sir,
S o w e cannot get any-
thing out of the Tory
government (not even
£20 increase on the
grant). Thank y o u for
m a k i n g it clear t h i s
week. Therefore your
solution is to replace the
Tory government b y a
" L a b o u r government
pledged to socialist poli-
c i e s " . T w o main ques-
tions then arise.
1. A c c o r d i n g to your
own argument, the Tor-
ies are being forced to
attack the living stand-
ards of the w o r k i n g
class because of the
rapidly deepening econo-
m i c crisis w h i c h , as y o u
point o u t i n your editor-
ial of October 1 6 t h , is
taking place on a w o r l d
scale not just in Britain.
W h e n (if) a Labour gov-
ernment lis elected, I
doubt very m u c h that
the w o r l d e c o n o m i c cris-
is will respond to this
by disappearing, so w i l l
not the Labour govern-
ment be forced to carry
out the same policies to
try a n d provide some
solution to this c r i s i s ?
2. Y o u want a Labour
government pledged to
socialist policies. T h e
Labour party is always
pledged to socialist poli-
cies. But, y o u may not
remember the last Lab-
our government. I d o . I
can remember " I n place
of s t r i f e " , the Labour
prices a n d incomes pol-
icy, high unemployment
under Labour; I can re-
member w h e n troops
were sent in to break the
1 9 6 6 dock strike, a n d
the Labour governments'
support for the Southern
African regime, for U . S .
aggression in Vietnam
and for Israels' expan-
sionist policies. A n d it
was a Labour govern-
ment that sent troops to
suppress the people of
Northern Ireland. W i t h
such a record, I doubt if
most people are fooled
any longer b y these
these 'socialist policies'.
Yours sincerely,
Kathleen C o r c o r a n .
Autonomy
Warning
Dear Sir,
Last week's U G M ex-
pressed a serious contra-
diction. T h e argument i n
favour of the U n i o n with-
holding money from the
College equal to the re-
fectory price increases was
defeated by someone
pointing out that the C o l -
lege has complete control
over U n i o n finances. T h e
College would merely de-
duct the same amount
from the Union's funds, as
it could equally do i n the
case of a rent strike.
Attempting to launch
serious campaigns to de-
fend I.C. students' inter-
ests let alone the interests
of exploited groups out-
side College, while the
U n i o n has no real auton-
omy, is naive a n d shows
ours to be a U n i o n with*;
out priorities.
