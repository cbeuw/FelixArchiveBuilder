pledged itself to a campaign round the
current 5 per cent increase i n refectory
prices that were imposed at the
beginning of this term.
A motion proposed by Paul Watkins
suggesting a petition to be prepared
condemning the price increases and
handed in to the Rector at a large
demonstration. It also proposed that
ECU hold back a sum of money equal
to the difference between the old and
new prices from payments made to the
college. If this failed to stop the price
rises an E . G . M . would be called to dis-
cuss different tactics.
Jock Veall argued against Watkins'
motion calling it a "recipe for defeat"
and proposed an amendment asking for
students to be issued with old price
lists so that they would only pay the old
prices. H e called for a campaign of
explanation to publicise the increases
and decisions taken to the staff and
students.
Pete Lambert argued against the
amendment saying that it tied people to
Mooneys, whereas inflation was every-
where, therefore one should call for
supplementary grants.
The amendment was passed 88-76 and
the amendment motion was passed over-
whelmingly.
N o r m Sayles, President I C U , argued
against the amended motion saying that
his main points were those printed i n
his column in Felix 9th October edition.
Recapped, these were that according to
the law, the College had no alternative
and that at least the recommended
increase wasn't higher.
The full motion passed by the
quorate (!) Union Meeting is:-
IC Union notes:
I. The continued erosion of the
student living standards caused by the
low grant and the high cost of food and
accommodation.
2 That the college has increased re-
fectory prices by 5 per cent despite
Union representation on the Refectories
Committee-and the Governing Body.
IC Union believes:
That the Governing Body should
defy the Government ( U G C ) self bal-
ancing jegulations, and subsidise prices
with a view to forcing the Government
to introduce refectory subsidies until the
N U S demands on grants are fully
satisfied.
1C U n i o n recommends:
That i n order to implement the
decision taken last term by a U G M to
freeze prices (i.e. to rescind the 5 per
cent increase) and to stop further
increases, the Grants Action Committee
and volunteers from this U n i o n meeting
who should be co-opted on to the G A C
shall organise:—
1. Tables to be set up in A L L
refectories to give change, so that stud-
ents are able to pay the correct money
for the old prices in the refectories.
2. O l d price lists to be distributed i n
the refectories.
3. A campaign of explanation to the
refectory staff and students, to publicise
the issues at stake and the decisions
taken.
A n entertainments motion was passed
abolishing the motion passed at the last
Council meeting of last year which
restricted the number of "large groups"
per term to three.
A n amendment was proposed b y John
Lane increasing, the number of "large
groups" to four per term but was
rejected as various Ents. personnel
promised no return to the situation of
last year, despite the motion not giving
an upper limit to the number of
"large groups" per term.
The original Council motion was
passed to ensure Ents. cater for a wider
range of tastes than just the groups
scene, which is why this year we have
films and folk groups as well as some
"large groups."
Volunteers numbering about a dozen
from the meeting were co-opted onto the
G . A . C . and included Piers Corbyn (IC
veteran) who was described by Tariq
Lolley as being "the only one with any
brains on the G A C . "
The quorum Was then challenged
successfully and the meeting was closed
before it could move o n to the next
item: Chile.
F I R E
F I R E B R O K E O U T i n the lockers of
the Forbes Laboratory in Zoology last
•
Thursday afternoon.
Discovered by a technician who
opened the door to the locker room and
found it full of thick smoke, the fire
destroyed a large number of plastic con-
tainers and incinerated the wood of the
lockers.
F o u r fire engines were rapidly outside
Beit H a l l summoned by the fire alarm
including two with extending ladders.
Water to extinguish the fire was pumped
from a hydrant outside Botany in Prince
Consort Road.
The Felix editor writes: T was in the
Buttery at the time the alarms went off,
assuming them to be a routine practice
I strolled outside to find smoke billow-
ing out of the third floor windows of
Zoology. Upstairs the Forbes lab was
full of dense acrid smoke which imme-
diately made your eyes water. People
were attempting to put the fire out with
hand extinguishers but the fire appeared
to have too great a hold.
'The firemen were quickly on the
scene with a hose hauled up from Beit
quad. A few lucky ones had breathing
apparatus—the others would only be
able to stand it in the lab for a few
minutes before dashing out eyes stream-
ing, gasping and coughing.
A f t e r about five minutes the smoke
started to subside, the windows were
opened to disperse what remained of the
choking fumes and we could see the
extent of the damage.
Water and foam covered the floor and
walls of the locker room, two windows
had been broken to let the smoke out,
burn marks and melted plastic were
everywhere. Inside the locker room the
heat was still intense—so much so that
the translucent plastic coyer on a fluor-
escent roof light had melted and dis-
torted out of all recognition. T h e fire
itself was by a l l appearances centred at
a low level in the lockers'.
The cause of the fire has not been
discovered and according to Norm
Sayles arson is not being discounted as
a possibility.
