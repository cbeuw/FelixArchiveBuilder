. Friends, if you perused the first edi-
tion of our esteemed college journal,
Felix, this term y o u may have seen
mention of a magazine, by name
P H O E N I X . Even i f this is not so, do
not despair, for I shall briefly recap
and expound here and now.
P H O E N I X is a magazine steeped i n
history. It was founded n years ago
by no lesser a person than H . G .
W E L L S , and has since been through
innumerable hands. A s of course, is to
be expected the magazine has greatly
evolved i n both form and content;
though some might say that the changes
have been by revolution not evolution.
Well, friends, n o w is your chance to
acquaint yourselves with and even buy
this famed magazine as last year's rather
delayed (to be regarded as a proof the
adage that 'time and printers wait for
no editors, be they Felix or P H O E N I X ' )
edition is now on sale. This excellent
magazine contains poems and prose and
artwork (ate.) hot from the fervoured
minds of I.C.'s literary giants (who hap-
pen to be posing at this moment as un-
cultured science a n d engineering stu-
dents).
The only catch in this superb and
unique offer is that ithe magazine costs
20p. N o w don't stop reading! Come on,
put your minces closer to this article
and have a good butchers! This u n -
fortunate accident is no fault of the
editors but is our lot deemed unto us
by those above, and is specially designed
to protect your scant dues paid into the
Union.
Well a further evolution has occurred
and I am editor—an editor, I might add,
with new ideas for the next edition of
P H O E N I X . However I a m also an edi-
tor Who is slightly lacking i n staff, owing
to the almost total third-year monopoly
of last year's magazine. So I am looking
for some fresh energetic minds who are
interested enough to drop me their
names—you don't have to be Shelleys
or Cervantes', just ordinary students
who can offer ideas and moral support
to your wilting editor as he fights
against the apathy of I.C.
A n d now we are at the heart of the
matter, apathy—or as I prefer, ignor-
ance a n d diffidence. In m y conversa-
tions with many people across the col-
lege I found that it was not that they
'could not be bothered' to contribute
articles, but that they had never heard
of P H O E N I X or h a d never seen one
and so d i d not know what sort of
material was wanted. So I shall tell you
now that we want: P O E M S , P R O S E
(fiction a n d non-fiction), A R T W O R K ,
C A R T O O N S — i n fact almost A N Y -
T H I N G . NOw there are 4000 odd stu-
dents at I.C., and I want every one of
you to put pen/brush/ehareoal/etc. to
paper and create something for the next
P H O E N I X . There is excellent potential
at I.C. to produce an outstanding maga-
zine; but the editing board cannot do
this on their o w n — P H O E N I X is Y O U R
magazine and stands o r falls b y Y O U R
contributions. So don't be shy, send in
your piece n o w ! I a m going to start
early to build up a good magazine, and
I need Y O U R help.
So if y o u are interested i n helping
behind the scenes o r wish to be the
star and have your name printed under
every fruit of your fertile spawn of
genius, send word (or composition) to
m e — S T E V E H E R M A N either (care-
fully labelled) v i a the Felix Office (3rd
floor, Union) or Via the Physics letter
rack.
M a n y Thanks,
K E E P O N W R I T I N G ! ! a n d B U Y
P H O E N I X ! !

GET MOVING
by Father William
Younger's Tartan—Free
A light fun record distributed free by
Youngers to promote 'Tartan' beer —
one of those paper thin single sided
P.V.C. efforts presumably given free
with n barrels of Tartan.
A typical example of this advertising
medium, the repetitive theme is original
enough " G e t M o v i n g (for Youngers
'Tartan')" but the backup lyrics ( e g
"It's time for living, it's time for . . .
any time at all") I feel I've heard be-
fore. However, for it's kind the musical
content is above average, and the ar-
rangement showed some forethought,
the tune's very catchy (of course!) and
could only be described as the commer-
cialist of pop.
Definitely a new departure for
Youngers — transferring the image of
'Tartan' from the drink of the burly
Highlander ito that of the ' T o p of the
Pops' set.
In short, worth a play if y o u get it
free.

It appears (in the eyes of the Social Clubs Committee) that this
Club is now dead. If there are any committee members lurking,
then could they please contact the Secretary (Peter Hughes, Chem.
Eng. P.G., Linstead Hall). Otherwise, its continued existence will
be questioned at the next S.C.C. meeting (due to be held on Dec-
ember 6th, 1973).

Sailing!
After the first couple of weeks of
total and absolute chaos with sailing
club trials and freshers days, a bit of
sanity reigned as the I.C. Sailing C l u b
team made towards Portsmouth, at least
during the chase down there.
However, things were brought back
to normality, as our navigators man-
aged to get us lost somewhere on South-
sea front.
Half-an-hour late, we arrived, and
it is here that I have to report the first
appalling efforts of our new captain,
Brian (Tweedale) Rogers, V . C . — no
first round was bought (many thanks
for the coke Nigel!).
Eventually the Portsmouth Poly team
led us to some submarine base i n the
depths of Pompey Dockyard where we
proceeded to start the first of three
races.
The three newcomers to the team,
Richard Woods (crewed b y hefty I a n
Hoppalong plus B . Tweedy a n d Chris
M i l l s plus P. Brain, then proceeded to
show the way round a n d gaining 2nd,
3rd, 4th after some fair team racing.
W i t h a good 2|- pts lead the old lags
took the helm with every confidence of
boosting this lead still further.
Everything was O . K . until the start
gun went a n d there were Hefty and
Tweedy stuck hard up against a jetty
and a couple of cruisers—neither were
moving.
However, at the first mark a Poly
boat retired after a port side incident
with yours truly.
With one short beat to go and i n a
comfortable 1, 2, 4, a certain un-named
member of the team managed to neatly
convert this at the finish to 1, 3, 5 after
trying to get our hon. captain through
to third. Sorry folks ! !
This gave us the match quite con-
vincingly by 7 pts. A further scratch
was put on and o u r Freshers neatly
notched up a 1, 2, 3 to end a pleasant
day's sailing.
