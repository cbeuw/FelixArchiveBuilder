SABOTAGE?
At Grants Action
Committee Meeting
Allegation
No-one expects that the
College Authorities will re-
spond favourably to our
just demands without us
putting up a fight. Indeed,
it was only the threat of
student action last term
which made the college
find some (small) subsidy,
not directly from tine U G C ,
to hold off 1 per cent o r
so of the refe'c price i n -
crease. Already, two days
after the U n i o n decision,
vague threats against the
Union are being put
about i n an attempt to
blackmail us . . . these
threats—if they become
'official'—will only serve
to show the college in the
light they deserve to be
seen.
However we do not nor-
mally expects threats of
sabotage a n d the like to
come from any group of
students—however small
and unrepresentative.
The Grants Action
Committee meeting called
on Thursday evening to
discuss the implementation
of U n i o n policy was re-
markably well attended.
A b o u t 50 people turned
up, 35 or so of whom
(who were new and i n this
case unwelcome because of
their unruly behaviour)
were from a group i n the
R S M commonly known as
T H E Minesmen. This
group which bears a close
resemblance to those who
sometimes come along to
U n i o n meetings to heckle.
fool-about, and challenge
the quorum if they c a n ,
did not come to help the
implementation of U n i o n
policy.
They came instead to try
and sabotage Union policy,
by proposing that its i m -
plementation be postpon-
ed to the last day of term!
If they h a d anything to
express—by speeches o r
voting—on refectories and
grants i n I C U n i o n the
place to do it is i n a
Union meeting. They
claim they had their o w n
meeting o n at the same
time as I C U G M so could-
n't come; well Mines meet-
ing was called after
I C U — p r o b a b l y as a ploy
to t r y a n d keep I C U i n -
quorate—a ploy which
doubly failed. T h e fact is

Students must always
welcome discussion but
cannot tolerate these silly
disrupters. I C U n i o n pol-
icy is made by I C U n i o n
meetings—no-one else.
After the 35 gentlemen

the remaining people—
largely those who h a d
been elected to G A C plus
a few co-opted volunteers

licity. Change (the Presi-
dent is being asked to

ies cannot be permitted to
sabotage the struggle
which is in the interests of
all I C students.
Refutation
It has been suggested
that I write to explain why
so many people turned up
to the Grants A c t i o n C o m -
mittee ( G A C ) last night,
and w h y they adopted
such an "obstructive" atti-
tude.
Firstly the Grants A c -
tion Committee is a purely
ad hoc committee with no
constitution o r rules drawn
up. This lays a n y such
committee open to control
by definitive groups who
can manipulate to suit
their own ideals.
The G A C h a d been
mandated by the I C U n -
ion meeting to organise
the motion o n refectories
dealing with paying only
the old prices for food. T o
leave such vital matters in
the hands of a committee
run on the lines explained
above is lunacy.
The other question rais-
ed was whether Refector-
ies have anything to do
with a Grants Campaign.
If the students at Imper-
ial College feel that the re-
fectories offer poor value
for money, or poor qual-
ity, or poor service then
let us stir u p the refector-
ies to establish the needs
of Ithe customers.
Let us not establish a
Grants Campaign that is
so a l l encompassing of
every grievance we have;
that it becomes so mas-
sive and unworkable as to
blatantly fail before it
should leave the discussion
table.
It is m y opinion that any
Grants Campaign should
be a single forged policy
ARE WE
UP-SIDE DOWN ?

What is the motivation that keeps
us studying? money? status? lack of
job? prestige? college's atmosphere?
security? If so, it is obvious that we
should feel bored and foolish. W e should
rather learn how to get money, a job,
etc., without having to learn and work
with a l l these difficult scientific and en-
gineering subjects Motivation precedes
all meaningful learning.
But if our "motivation" is either i n -
ertia or that we like Maths. Physics, etc..
then our motivations are academic and
to some extent independent of the "out-
side world", we are likely to feel there-
fore irresponsible, ordered about, arbi-
trarily graded, useless, etc., Motivation
should come from the " r e a l " or "out-
side w o r l d " and not from within the
college or from (prepackaged curricu-
la. "Phis applies unless we expect to
solve iproblems of Ithe college only, re-
gardless of anything else—or unless we
intend to declare ourselves irresponsible
(i.e. someone else's tools) and. want to
coroperate blindly to increase the a l -
ready overgrown world's power for
whatever the "future" (i.e. the people
holding power o r the system's inertia)
may reserve for us.
One should be allowed to learn what
one is really motivated to learn, a n d
not simply to acquire scarce "know-
ledge" to monopolise it and sell it as
an expensive item o r exchange it for
status security, etc.; or not simply to be
able to accept whatever kind of "know-
ledge" is being pumped -in our heads
after a forced selection from among a
number of pre packaged choices being
put to us.
Let me consider a subject like many
others, say Nuclear Reactor Physics; the
typical order of teaching is more or
less:
1—The atom, -its nature, etc.
2 — E = m c 2
3 — Nuclear reactions, energy liberation,
etc.
4 — The reactor, description, classifica-
tion, etc.
5 — Nuclear reactors engineering
6— (Sometimes) Nuclear reaction econo-
mics.
Separately, if one is lucky enough to
find out, one ca n join such courses as
"Environment and M a n " o r Science 8c
Society", where (again with luck) some-
one may talk of the role of Nuclear re-
actors in some real situation such as
solving the energy crisis. I n any case, by
the time we find out something about
the real problems, it is too late F O R U S
to decide whether or not the course is
not a prefabricated jerry
built failure. It should be
marketed as b y anyone
else i n industry does with
their o w n products. T h e
campaign should be care-
fully thought, hammered
into shape, extensively ex-
plained a n d advertised
and then released with
considerably more chance
of success.

A t a union general meet-
ing o n Tuesday at the
Polytechnic of N o r t h L o n -
don it was decided by a p-
proximately 350 for to 100
against to occupy the A d -
ministration block i n the
Holloway precinct.
The students have been
sleeping i n overnight a n d
manning the telephone ex-
change as well as prevent-
ing the Aministration staff
from having access to a l l
files and documents neces-
sary to the running of the
college.
The students are calling
for the resignation of the
Director of N L P , Terence
Miller. H e has fought since
his appointment against
student representation o n
committees and the auto-
nomy of the student union.
A motion which amount-
ed to a motion of no con-
fidence in Miller was nar-
rowly defeated at a Court
of Governors meeting o n
the Monday before the
U n i o n General Meeting by
15 votes to 11.
The President, Terry
Povey told me that the
occupation would continue
until M i l l e r leaves. There
was no mention of the
other problems that stud-

ents face i n the original
motion.
The foyer of the A d m i n
block i n Holioway R o a d
was plastered with posters
exclaiming " M i l l e r m a n
must g o ! " referring to the
depiction of M i l l e r as a
student-bashing robot i n -
vented by the Tories in the
current edition of the Poly
handbook.
The students manning
the telephone exchange
and upstairs sitting o n
cushions >n the offices were
all wearing badges saying
" M i l l e r o u t " which date
from the first occupation
to try a n d remove Miller
from his post.

the occupying students
and several had copies of
a letter from the Univer-
sity of Stirling implying
that M i l l e r had applied for
the post of Principal a n d
Vice-Chancellor there.
Lfcst Thursday meetings
were held in a l l the pre-
cincts ( N L P is spread over
quite a large area) to dis-
cuss the occupation. T h e
general feeling of the.se
meetings was one of con-
fusion at why the execu-
tive, having tabled the or-
iginal motion, appeared at
that stage to be trying to
run the occupation down.
Terry Povey told m e
"we are keeping the occu-
pation small so that stud-
ents don't become demor-
alised" whereas the stud-
ents i n the precinct meet-
ings appeared to feel that
the reverse should be the
case.
Perhaps the main reason
for demoralisation is sum-
med up by a poster prom-
inent in the entrance read-
ing "Let's inject some
politics into this occupa-
tion".
He has frozen their
funds for the third time,
and the students are de-
manding that they be i m -
mediately unfrozen.
useful.
Result: once one has already studied
all that, the only possibility of feeling
that one is useful or needed, or of finding
a job, is by trying to solve any prob-
lem by applying the learned techniques
of Nuclear Reactors. Obviously the
motivation to study in such a way may
be status, money, inertia, etc., but not
the wish to solve real problems such as
energy supplies, crisis, etc., simply be-
cause we didn't even know that such
problems existed sometimes.
How about trying the other way
around? i.e. based on motivation, e.g.
1— Enersv requirements of present way
of life"
2 — Alternatives
If the student still believes that more
energy is required and that it is the
only solution (or the best) . . . and
feels inclined to try or help to solve
the problem:
3
——Energy production methods, conse-
quences, costs, etc.
If the student still believes that Nuc-
lear energy is a solution . . .
4 — Nuclear Reactors, types, economy,
social implications, ecological and
political effects, possibilities, etc.
Again, if the student still . . .
5 — Nuclear Reactor physics and engin-
eering: research design, construction
maintenance, management, etc., job
conditions, possibilities and scope,
present organisations, etc.
If the s t u d e n t . . .

etc.
Result: 1—only those who believe, i n
what they are doing will continue, 2 —
the motivation will be a continuous
drive improving the learning, 3—those
who don't feel motivated to the subject
simply split and have opportunity to
cither deal with the same problem in a
different field or to look for more satis-
fying studies, problems, work, etc. In
short: Healthy responsible learning not
indoctrination.
This means saving, of educational re-
sources (time, money, lectures, etc.) o »
the side of the educating organisation,
and of precious time, effort, frustration,
etc.. Oil the part of the student: plus
this also leads to enjoyable and desir-
able work rather than a compulsory and
dull one.
If what we want is people's education
rather than boosting our statistics and
records, we should stop considering edu-
cation as commercial goods that can
be given to anybody w h o pays for it
independently of whether or not that
person is interested or motivated to
learn.
