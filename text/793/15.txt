GLIDING
Imperial College Gliding Club
(ICGC) is the oldest university gliding
club in the country and at present,
owns three gliders (single seaters).
On the Saturday before last a
typical winter weekend's contingent
of ICGC members travelled to
Lasham Gliding Centre near Alton in
Hampshire seeking instruction.
On arrival we managed to procure
a two-seat glider and the services of
an old Polish instructor whom we
found in a corner of the.. .clubhouse.
During the day I was able to get four
flights, the highlight of which was
doing a full spin and recovering (a
good job I missed lunch!). The total
flying cost of the day for me was
£11.98 (thanks to hefty ICGC
discounts!).
Gliding does, however, involve a
lot of waiting around for flights.
During this time you are expected to
help with the running of the flightline
by pushing gliders around, controlling
launches, logging flights etc—but
believe me, it all becomes worthwhile
once you get into the air. 'Going Solo'
is where the ultimate challenge and
excitement occurs—in soaring flight.
During the summer months it is
possible to remain aloft for several
hours and to cover hundreds of miles
by making use of the thermals (rising
currents of air).
If you are interested in gliding,
please come to one of our weekly
meetings (every Thursday at 5.30pm
in Aero 254). For the paltry sum of
£10 we will transport you to the
airfield and give you a 15 minute trial
flight. You can then decide whether
or not you want to join the club (this
costs £26per year). But we bet you'll
be hooked!

CONSOC
MP visit
On Thursday 21st January, Teresa
Gorman, MP for Billericay, came at
the invitation of IC Conservative
Society to speak on the subject of
'Serfdom or Sovereignty—the picture
of the welfare state'.
She feels that people in Britain have
become used to the state doing
everything for them, robbing them of
their ability to think and do things for
themselves, and reducing them to the
level of vegetables.
She continued by comparing those
individual needs supplied by the state
(health, council housing, education)
with those provided by private means
(food, clothing, etc), noting that those
in shortage, or of generally low
quality, were the former group. Mrs
Gorman indentified the problem with
the welfare system as being that it is
producer dominated rather than
consumer controlled.

repaired and will be positioned on top

weeks (giving Imperial College one
of the highest VHF antenna sites in
London!).
Following the short article in FELIX
two weeks ago Hamsoc was deluged
with new prospective members
interested in amateur radio—most
wanting to apply for the Radio
Amateur Exam to gain a transmitting
licence. Even a prospective college
applicant turned up to have a chat with
chairman Phil Pavelin! The large
number of new licencees gained by
members in the last examinations in
December also means that Hamsoc
will be able to provide help for other
societies (such as marshalling in
rallies). If you see any of us, and are
interested in amateur radio, why not
ask us about it?
The latest society news is that the
WEIGHTS
New training courses (four sessions
per course, one session per week) for
Tuesday and Wednesday lunchtimes
(1pm to 2pm) will begin in the eighth
and sixth week of term respectively.
Contact Andrew Tay (Physics 2) for
the Wednesday slot and C Donegan
(Biochem PG) for the Tuesday slot.
Each session will begin with
instruction in basic exercises and the
remainder will be given over to the
discussion and explanation of very
comprehensive handouts.
The most recent news is that there
will be a Friday course beginning
today (1.30pm to 2.30pm) and
possibly a women's course provided
there is enough interest. Those
interested in the Friday course should
meet outside the provision shop in
Southside today. Those interested in
the Women's course should send a
note with name, department and type
of training wanted to Linda Donegan
(c/o C Donegan). To correct a
mistake in the last note, all present
courses will cost 75p per session.
