S.A. policy
For the first time in Imperial College
Union's history, it has a policy on
South Africa. At Tuesday's Union
General Meeting held in the Junior
Common Room, a motion was passed
supporting the London School of
Economics Union in their fight to get
their College to disinvest in South
Africa.
The motion was passed by a
majority, despite an attempt by its
opposition to call quorum before it
was debated. The students present
heard how LSE has shares in Shell,
one of the companies that invests in
South Africa.
Another motion concerning the new
Union job descriptions was also
passed following amendments. Any
sabbatical job descriptions will now
have to be discussed at an Executive
meeting (Union Officers) or
Publications Board (FELIX
Editor/Print Unit Manger) before
being passed at consecutive Council
and Union General Meeting. This
follows the rapid shake-up in the
Union last month when Council,
alone, was required to change these
job descriptions.
Tell Syd:

to Aussie
Union President Ian Howgate has
changed his name by deed pole to
Sydney Harbour-Bridge as a charity
stunt. The idea was dreamt up by IC
Radio's Simon Bichara during a
'boring lecture' last week. He
mentioned it to his fellow IC Radio
members who thought that it would
be an excellent way to raise money
for Comic Relief last Friday. They
then approached Ian with a short list
of silly names which he could choose
from. They were Phil Harmonic-
Orchestra, Sydney Opera-House,
Albert Memorial and Sydney
Harbour-Bridge. Syd says that his
choice of name was influenced by the
fact that his birthday falls on Australia
Day and that this year is Australia's
bi-centenial.
It was decided that a sum of £500
would have to be raise for Comic
Relief before he agreed to change his
name. The latest reports indicate a
total in excess of £800 was raised on
Friday.
The change took place at a London
solicitors after consultation with his
bank manager and College Registry.
It has been agreed that his degree will
be in the name of Mr S H Bridge
should he keep the name for that long.
He has already agreed to keep the

complaints
stop parties
Following complaints about noise
from late night parties in the Union
Building, parties have been banned
from the Union Dining Hall, Senior
Common Room and Concert Hall.
This was brought about by official
letters sent by Borough
Environmental Health Officers to the
Union warning that the noise must
stop.
Recently the Concert Hall has been
fitted with double glazing, but there
is little ventilation and so during
parties the windows are opened and
the noise escapes.
The Lounge, which is below street
level on the North Side of the building
is unaffected by these arrangements.

David Smedley, current RCSU
'Broadsheet' Editor, has been
returned unopposed as this year's
Freshers' Handbook Editor.
