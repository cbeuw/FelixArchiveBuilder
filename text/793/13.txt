This film is based on the true story
of Kenya's greatest scandal. In 1941
Lord Errol, a young Scottish lord,
was found murdered outside Nairobi.
He was a well known figure in
Kenyan society, one of the happy
valley set, and had a reputation as a
gambler and adulterer.
At the time of his death he was in
the middle of an affair with Lady
Diana Broughton (Greta Scacchi).
Her husband Lord Broughton was
subsequently charged with murder.
During the trial many of the more
sordid details of Kenyan high society
life were revealed. These included
details of adultery, wife swapping and
orgies, the leading perpetrators being
the happy valley set.
It is this side of the story that
Michael Radford the director
concentrates on. The mystery of the
identity of the murderer, unknown to
this day, is ignored and the audience
are left in no doubt as to who Radford
thinks killed Joss Errol. The film
concentrates on the affair between
Joss and Diana, and not Jack
Broughton's murder. It is billed as a
true story but is very economical with
the facts and they are wildly
interpreted. The main actors are all
very good, especially Joss Alkland as
Broughton and Trevor Howard in his
last role. However, the characters
they play have been exaggerated
almost into caricatures.
The film itself does not do the story
justice and moves along at a slow pace
with a weak script. The cast is superb
and the acting excellent but they don't
make up for the rest of the film.

Angel Dust
As all avid viewers of late-night
Channel 4 continental films will tell
you, it's difficult to tell what the hell
French films are about. In a French
film, a character gazing into space for
ten minutes accomplishes two things;
one, it's a statement about the
growing unease of the working
classes at the corruption of the
communist government (or something
like that, anyway). Two, it bores half
the audience to death in one fell
swoop. Unfortunately, you have to be
French to appreciate the former, and,
if you paid to see the film, you're
pretty pissed off at the latter.
Angel Dust suffers from the same
problems that afflict the films of Jean-
Jacques Beineix (who recently
directed Betty Blue, easily the most
coherent and best French film to be
released in years); the story is
basically one of detection, be it
somewhat surreal/off the wall.
However, the film attempts to
introduce irrational events into a plot
that is moving in exactly the opposite
direction, and the result is something
akin to condensing six lanes of the M5
into a narrow country lane. The
detection plot, which unveils
mysteries, clashes painfully with the
introduction of new, odd mysteries;
consequently the film fails either as
a neo-supernatural work or as a
straight detective story.
Despite all this, however, the film
is still interesting: it's the story of the
avenging of a girl"^ prostitute
mother's murder. The girl, Violetta,
and Gabriel, her life long friend,
engineer the murder of the pimp
responsible for Violetta's mother's
death. Policeman Simon Blount starts
investigating, slowly uncovering the
truth.
Violetta and Gabriel are endowed
with an almost angel quality, but the
basis for this religiose aura is then
made absurd by their all too human
desire to avenge the mother's murder.
Despite these laboured Christian
overtones, the film contains some
attractive ideas; Simon, the
policeman, is rather prone to bouts of
violence, and is paralleled with
Gabriel, the murderous 'holy fool',
and both are portrayed as exceedingly
vulnerable to Violetta, the controlling
angel.
While the plot on its own is well
put together, it's just a bit too
fluctuating in tone and mood to be
really successful. This isn't helped by
the gratuitous over-direction; blurring
pans and huge tracking shots distort
the narrative, distracting one from the
plot.
Angel Dust believes in a simple
code of morals; violence is a
cleansing force. But strangely
enough, Angel Dust (probably more
than a little related to Angel Heart in
ideas at least) has a charm similar to
Betty Blue—although it is confusing
and laboured, it's nevertheless quite
good. However, unless you're really
sure you want to go and see it, don't,
because you might well be very
disappointed and peeved at having
parted with good cold cash.
Assault on Precinct 13
A re-release of one of John
Carpenter's first films; a police
station is besieged by a youth mob
armed with stolen silenced automatic
weapons. Despite the obvious
limitations in budget, the film is still
gripping—the long, drawn out
establishing scenes neatly
counterpoint the latter vicious bouts
of gunplay. The characters are
actually characters, which is a
pleasant surprise in this day and age.
Definitely worth hiring, even if you
already have seen it on telly.
Eric Clapton
Never having seen Clapton live on
stage before, I didn't know what to
expect, but a few reports told of a
brilliant performance. I arrived just
as the support act, Jonathan Butler,
came on stage. He did.as well as
anybody playing guitar in support to
Clapton could do, but no one was
really listening, but rather peering
through a crack in the stage door
trying to catch a glimpse of 'God', as
we call him. J B left the stage and
everyone sat around looking
disgruntled when suddenly the lights
died down and blinding spotlights
swept the arena. We didn't need to
be told who was coming, the
Stratocaster said it all. No one else
could play the guitar like that.
Crossroads began, and from then on
it was all I could do to take it in. Most
had seen him once, many twice, and
they could sit and listen, but I was in
awe of the great power in front of me.
He transformed the hard-ripping solo
of White Room into the relaxing
Wonderful Tonight that you felt that
you were on some kind of wonderful
drug, but nothing so potent existed.
It was only after two hours of his
playing that I began to look at his
band, but band is not the name, since
each is an artist in his own right. Steve
xxx(?—TS) and Phil Collins provided
all the drum support needed, while a
madman, Ray Cooper, smashed his
way through percussion. Alan Clark
and Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits
were on keyboard and guitar, and the
marvellous Nathan East was playing
the bass guitar. Between them they
produced a dream concert. Obviously
the rest of the crowd agreed with me,
because he came back three times—I
can't read this can someone translate
it? Preferably the person who wrote
it—Rose.
Martyn ?
Slamdance
Last year's revival of film noir—see
the review in FELIX, last year.
Platoon
Oliver Stone's film, ostensibly the
film about Vietnam. However the
showing by the BBC of The Killing
Fields this Christmas put Platoon
where it belongs—on the Rambo pile.
Good viewing, nevertheless.
