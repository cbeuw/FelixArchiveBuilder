Papa: a
man for all
seasons?
Well a few interesting things have
happened since I last wrote a piece for
FELIX, so I thought I ought to tell
you.
1. There is a 'Stop Clause 28'
march and rally in Manchester on
Saturday February 20th, which is
followed by a festival in the evening,
with the Communards, Erasure and
other celebs turning up to perform!
(free entrance to any of Manchester's
gay nightclubs as a bonus!! Anyone
who wants to go, it's only £5 on BR
if you've got a railcard, or I can (for
about £3) get you a seat on a coach
if you contact me asap (Union Office
or Mech Eng pigeonholes).
2. The Society for Lesbian and Gay
Students (SLAGS) is now official, we
meet in the Green Committee Room
on Wednesday at 12.30pm (top floor
of the Union Building) come and chat,
elections soon, noticeboard on
Sherfield walkway and some exciting
(?) speakers too! I'm very pleased that
so many new people have been
coming along. If you people make the
effort I'm sure you will benefit (I
mean, you'll get to meet me for a
start).
3. I am very, very worried by the
amount of obscene graffiti I see in the
Mech Eng and Union Building toilets.
Either some of you have perverse
imaginations, or there are some pretty
desperate people out there. I'm
worried that it may be the latter, and
my advice to these people is that they
should try and get out and meet other
gay people in more normal
surroundings, eg pubs, nightclubs or
groups like SLAGS or ULU Lesbian
and Gay Group. Not only is meeting
people through graffiti in toilets
probably dangerous but it gives a very
bad impression of gay people. I, for
one, have made many new and fun
friends from these meetings and I'm
sorry to disappoint everyone (oh God,
I'm going to ruin my image) but I
haven't slept with any of them! Bang
goes my New Year resolutions.
4. I have been flirting all week as
I want to get a record number of
Valentines this year. I need to get nine
because I got eight in 1986, so please
send me a Valentine, even those (few)
who don't fancy me!

No tax on reading
There are strong rumours that in next
month's Budget, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer may extend the coverage
of V A T in line with European
Community guidelines. One area that
may be thus taxed is publishing-
books,newspapers and magazines.
To tax the published word is to tax
information and knowledge, the
bricks and mortar of a university
degree. A tax on reading has been
opposed for over 100 years by
successive governments. As well as
hitting the student directly, it would
make a big dent in education budgets
and research being done for
publication.
In the College Bookshop, all prices
would rise overnight by up to 15%,
and it is unlikely the Chancellor will
increase student grants to cope with
this increase in expenditure.
If you oppose VAT on reading,
write to your MP and MEP now,
telling him that you strongly object to
the concept of tax on information and
knowledge and asking them to take up
the fight against VAT on the written
word.

Letter from St Mary's
One of the best things to happen in
a term, from my point of view, is a
visit to the mountain hut in North
Wales. Being a northerner life in
London can get claustrophobic,
repetitious and draining. Escaping
from the mad house, allowing the
body to naturally recharge is as good
a tonic as beer north of Watford
(plenty of that too).
The hut at Drws-y-coed (four miles
west of Snowdon) is the perfect
escape. Given to the medical school
some years ago, the hut has been
converted from a holiday cottage into
a bunk house. The situation is
excellent, with walks and good
climbing nearby.
All meets produce a little legend in
themselves, which is all recorded in
the log book. Obviously certain times
of the year see 'events', notably the
Freshers' Meet, where horrible things
are done to and by newcomers. In my
first year, I shall always remember
seeing a certain gentleman fill half a
bucket because he was too drunk to
climb downstairs and spend a penny.
By the Dinner Meet at Christmas,
those first years have found their own
niche and a few join the older
members in a weekend of what can
only be described as true debauchery.
Barrels were taken up in the bus, the
only problem being that the glasses
were in one of the cars. A transfer of
pint pots was executed at 70 mph on
the M5.
Arriving at 3am, those who had
travelled up earlier were suffering
from alcohol withdrawal symptoms,
as all the ale travelled in the bus.
Thirsts were soon quenched and many
moved off to bed, the only problem
being that a vocal minority insisted on
singing well into the morning. Only
their seniority saved them from
serious abuse.
During the day exercise is always
light, in preparation for the dinner at
a local hotel. In my case a saunter up
Tryfan off the A5 sufficed, though it
was not without difficulty as the
clamber was on ice all the way to the
summit. Not a cloud in the sky added
to the achievement producing such a
feeling impossible in NW6! The view
was breathtaking, enhanced by the
shadows created from a low sun.
After changing into destructables,
the participants were bussed to the
hotel on the shores of Llyn Cwellyn.
Serious eating, drinking and removal
of garments ensued. Excellent
speeches from the distinguished
medical people present gained
rapturous applause.
The meeting was ajourned allowing
for those willing to take a dip in the
lake, before retiring to the bar for a
few dozen or so after dinner spirits.
Even more alcohol awaited our return
to the hut. The following afternoon
various early options, eg inhabiting
Pete's Eats in Llanbevis proved
popular and the assembled throng
moved off home at dusk, after waiting
for a couple of people leaving the
decent Flying Buttress a little late.
Home was finally reached at 2am on
Monday morning. I
Wicked!

I love it when
you roar at
me.

Squidlydiddly. Take us
with you wherever you
go. Love

Melanie at St Mary's.
I want to stroke you.
Love Nick Bow
Darling Steve Pearson,
leave your new toy girl
and come back to being
my toy boy,
lots of love

My first is in old but not in the court,
My second's in desire that's not to be
fought,
My third is in cold that's not in my heart,
My last is in bike but not to depart,
If that's me in short,
there's one thing to do,
Deliver this
riddle to
VRMI BASU.
