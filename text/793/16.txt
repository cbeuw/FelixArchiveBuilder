ROCK SOC
Comic Relief
Rock Soc managed to raise £100.33
for Comic Relief last Friday by
selling burgers in Beit Quad and
mugging people for the collection
can! We even got a mention on Radio
One, but this was mostly because our
colleagues from UCL Rock Soc had
hijacked the Friday Rock Show.
We'd like to thank everyone who
helped out, everyone who donated,
and especially those brave enough to
buy the burgers. Special thanks also
to Dr Finlay for the amazing sauce,
Dramsoc for shedding some light on
the matter, and Jelly and the bar staff
who munched their way through the
last box of burgers, and were
generally helpful. Finally 'ta' to the
anonymous stripper!
Future events include free video
night on Tuesday (16th) in Norman's
which will feature Whitesnake and
Hendrix. Be there at 8pm! Don't
forget to come along to our Monday
lunchtime meetings (Southside Upper
Lounge) to find out what else is going
on.

AMNESTY
No charge
Munif Mulhim has been held in
detention without charge or trial since
his arrest in August 1981 for his
membership of the prohibited Party
for Communist Action (PCA).
Murif Mulhim's health is reported
to be poor. He continues to suffer
from a malignant tumor for which he
has not been given the necessary
medical attention. In August 1984,
Amnesty International (Al) learned
that his condition had deteriorated,
apparently as a result of torture. A l
initiated urgent appeals on behalf of
Murif Mulhim and two other detained
members of the PCA also reported to
be seriously ill at the time. In June
1985 Al again appealed to the Syrian
authorities on his behalf following
further reports that his health had
seriously deteriorated, that he
continued to be deprived of medical
treatment, and that family visits had
been curtailed.
Please write to Rif at al-Assad,
Vice President, Office of the
President, Muhajirin, Presidential
Palace, Abu Rummaneh, Al-Rashid
Street, Damascus, Syrian Arab
Republic, urging that he be given all
necessary medical care and treatment,
and that he be given a fair trial and
be released unconditionally if not
charged.
FILM S O C
Go wild
IC Film Soc present Something Wild
on Thursday 18th February at 7pm in
Mech Eng 220.
Charles Driggs is the newly-
appointed vice president of a large tax
consultancy—a man as conservative
as his starched white shirt and about
as adventurous as his calorie-
controlled lunch.
But when he finishes that meal in
a Mid-Manhattan diner, he pockets
the check and strolls out without
paying.
Only Lulu Hankel notices the petty
theft.
Lingering over coffee a few seats
away, she has recognised Driggs as
a kindred spirit and whether he's
willing or not, she knows how he will
spend Friday afternoon.
It is an experience he will
remember the rest of his life—or the
rest of the weekend—whichever
comes first.
50p members, £1 non-members
(membership available).
City runabout
Ever been chased around the square
mile of the City of London looking
for letters stamped on boltheads on
roadsigns? No—then you've
obviously never been on a Guilds
Motor Club Mini Miglia. It starts in
a car park near Smithfield Market at
10pm this Saturday and finishes at
1.45am on the North side of Finsbury
Circus.
In between you have to find
answers to sixty clues (twenty easy,
MOTOR CLUB
twenty medium and twenty difficult).
To do this you are given a large scale
map and a list of eight figure grid
references.
Everyone is welcome to enter and
competition membership is available
on the night for 50p to non-members.
The entry fee is £2 per car and the
maps and grid references will be
given out in Southside Upper Lounge
between 7pm and 8pm on Saturday
(13th).
Letter record
At the end of November, the Jewish
Society held a stall in the JCR to write
letters to a Soviet refusenik. This was
in conjunction with similar efforts up
and down the country, to try and set
a new World Record for the most
letters sent to one person in one day.
Imperial students wrote 40 letters
to Michael Stollar, and in total 4000
letters were sent to him, and were
delivered to the Moscow Central Post
| Office on one day just before
Christmas. I would like to thank all
those who wrote, and the achievement
J is such that Norris McWhirter has
i given his personal assurance that it
will be included in the next Guinness
Book of Records. The stall also
collected 250 signatures for a petition
JEWISH
that was presented at the recent
summit between Reagan and
Gorbachev, and nationwide over 5000
signatures were gathered.
A proposal for a Soviet Jewry
Action Group is currently under
considertion by the Social Clubs
Committee. The SJAG, which will be
affiliated to various national and
• international groups, will campaign
for the rights of Soviet Jews,
including their right to leave the
Soviet Union, and anyone even
vaguely interested should make
themselves known at the stall, or
contact Paula Lyons (DoC 1), or
Philip Schryber (Elec Eng 2).

SCIENCE FICTION
ICSF present Silent Running on
Tuesday February 16th in ME220,
7pm.
Those of you that have seen this
film will know just how good it is.
The rest of you, come and see it! One
of the best films of the genre ever
made, concerning a time when the
only plants left are held in orbit
around Earth, in museums; and the
museums are about to be closed
down. One of the curators takes three
gardening robots and his supplies and
jettisons in one of the museum
bubbles. There follows the most
brilliant piece of continuous one-
person acting ever seen, as the curator
attempts to keep the plants alive on
their way out of the solar system.
ANTI APARTHEID
