Light winds
IC vs Surrey University
This weekend saw IC in action against
Surrey University. Conditions were
excellent, light winds and plenty of
sunshine to roast those with dry suits
on.
Not to be put off by the late arrival
of the opposition (still celebrating
Friday) we had time for some
sightseeing, somewhere near
Guildford. Over early morning coffee
the captian Richard Jarman talked
tactics and instilled his enthusiasm in
the team.
The three morning races went well
for IC, as Surrey were taken out in
the first race by a surprise attack from
the rear, good covering by Ape
enabled the last boat to gain 1st place.
This gave an easy win with 1st, 2nd
and 5th places to IC.
Surrey were clearly stunned and
looked like losing the 2nd race, but
although 1st place was assured for IC,
3rd and 5th slipped to 4th and 6th
under pressure from Surrey. Giving
them a close win.
Both teams pushed hard in the 3rd
race with many forced mistakes or
rule offences resulting in points
(known as greens) agains the
offending boats. By the end of the
race IC were not in the top places but
scraped through on points after a
contested protest, giving us a 2-3 win
overall.
Following an ample lunch,
designed to give Surrey a weight
advantage in the light afternoon airs,
sailing was continued with a change
in boats and teams. This compounded
the problem of weight advantage,
with both the captain and commodore
in the same boat. However, Sam Page
(commodore) was determined to do
well, resulting in a very close race and
superior roll tacks from IC. Light airs
were getting lighter and eventually
Surrey decided to withdraw. The
afternoon result being a draw, IC
managed to scrape an overall win.
IC V 1 - LSE V 0
Last Saturday, somewhat shaken by
the Ball (at the Savoy the night
before), IC V assembled for their Cup
semi-final against LSE V.
The match was annoyingly close.
LSE were hardly in the Liverpool
mould, despite dominating, IC had
very few clear cut chances. The one
opening fell to Tan, who, with a quick
shuffle of that famous waistline
cleared a path to goal, but his superb
shot was only stopped by a save so
absolutely sensational that it would
have made even the great Steve Von
Bargen proud (can I have that fiver
now please Tan?). In defence, IC
were so dominant that our goalie,
Steve, went off for thirty minutes for
a jodrell and no one noticed. Jon,
Mike, Lee and Basher made it easy
for the team. On the sidelines, Kev,
Brad and Al were contributing their
support with great passion. The game
IC II 2-Goldsmiths II 1
Having been unable to play for two
weeks due to flooded pitches, IC
found themselves up against
Goldsmiths again, in another top of
the table clash. With much pre-match
banter and a fine speech from captain
Jezz Holland, IC II set out to show
why they are the most successful IC
team this season. The mixture of
experience of Paul Thompson, Russ
Dark and the "balding Andy Allen,
with the youthful running and
enthusiasm of Guy Phiri and Chris
Burton proved too much for
Goldsmiths. Mickey Plummer and Ed
Coates combining brilliantly on the
left forced many chances. Ed himself
opened the scoring mid-way through
the first half, with a cool, clinical
finish, from just inside the box.
Goldsmiths rallied, and should have
drifted to extra time. Tan's ageing
legs were replaced by the 'not much
more energetic' Paul. John Bolger
came into his own, and inevitably, the
goal came.. .Peter played a superb ball
that sliced the defence like a knife
through a carrot (ok, no more jokes
about the redecorated bathrooms).
Bassim took it in his stride, cut inside,
fended off the defender and struck the
most unbelievable lob over the
advancing goalkeeper. The ball took
an eternity to cross the line (in fact,
almost as long as it took for the Dean
to finish his dinner speech), but it
crept in, and we were there. They
were never going to score. Ean and
Glenn were simply strolling it in
midfield, and despite Basher's
booking late in the game (first of the
season for anyone in the team), IC
had done it.
equalised straight away, but their
hopeful shot blazed over the bar. Just
before half-time, Jezz Holland went,
down after a collison with a
Goldsmiths forward. An expected
torn calf muscle could rule Jezz out
of the rest of what has been an
unlucky season for him. After the
switch, as Jeff Fitzgerald came on as
sub, Chris Burton dropped into
defence but Goldsmiths fought back.
Rakesh Muthoo's growing influence
on the game inspired IC and after a
mix up in Goldsmiths' defence,
Rakesh stabbed the ball home. IC then
controlled the game until the final
whistle. Having beaten most teams at
least once now in the league, IC look
to be odds-on favourites for the
league.

Struggle
UAU Challenge Round
It has been a good year so far for IC
badminton in UAU with all teams
reaching the last 16 but then the only
rewards for this achievement were 3
very tough away draws. The Mens
and Ladies teams both drew last
year's championships, Loughborough
and Birmingham respectively and
Mens II had to travel to Bath.
Birmingham defeated IC in the
Ladies final last year so a victory in
this mid-stage competition would
have been sweet revenge. Sadly this
was not to be, even though
Birmingham had split up their first
pair to even out the strength of their
team. The match was close but might
have been closer. Julie Goodeve and
Uta Boltze, having beaten the first
pair, had also beaten the Birmingham
seconds. The IC seconds, Sarah
Threadgold and Ann Redley, also had
a good match by beating the
opponents third pair and then
narrowly losing out to the
Birmingham firsts—another crucial
and matchwinning result. The end
result was 6-3 in Birmingham's
favour, a repeat of last year's final.
In Bath the Mens second team were
made to struggle. Although Alastair
.McMaster and Svein Tollefsen nearly
caused a riot by winning 2 of their 3
rubbers it was not enough to see them
to the quarter finals. The final score
was a victory to Bath by 7-2.
Having seen Loughborough's team
at the U A U championships last
November there was a great deal of
hope and a genuine feeling that IC
might create an upset by defeating the
champions. This hope turned to
wishful thinking as Loughborough
cruised to a 9-0 whitewash despite
some defiant badminton from the IC
team. In reality some of the matches
were not as one-sided as the scoreline
suggests but it was a shame that after
so much effort we did not even come
away with a point.
Balding, but favourites
HOCKEY
Nice strategy—shame about the result
IC 0—Bristol 2
Imperial College lsts travelled West
last Wednesday to play against Bristol
University in the U A U challenge
round. Up against a highly coached,
skilled, fancied and supported team,
captain Brooking recognised IC to be
the underdogs. Counting on this
year's exceptional defence, he
sanctioned a disciplined marking
game coupled with surprise counter-
attacks. This strategy kept IC in
contention during the first half with
no player making more vital
interceptions and tackles than
Brooking himself. Brendan Farmer
followed his captain's example. The
early second half continued in the
same fasion—outstanding defence
with sporadic attack. With only
twenty minutes to play, the Bristol
team were losing discipline and IC
were beginning to create goal
chances. Skipworth, Vamadevan and
Collman all failed to turn openings
into a famous victory. Ironically it
was now Bristol who were able to
counter-attack. They did so
effectively forcing short corners and,
eventually, a goal. With IC forced
into the attack, a second goal
inevitably came. The loss of Brooking
(sent off) sealed the game for Bristol,
giving them a place in the quarter
finals.
