P G only hall
Weeks Hall may be changed to a
postgraduate hall of residence
and wardens will be able to chose
re-apps without consulting
residents, following a meeting of
College's Student Residence
Committee (SRC) on Wednesday.
The idea of a postgraduate only hall
has been discussed throughout the
academic year. A survey of
postgraduates presently in residence
showed a favourable response to the
proposal. It was also felt by SRC that
having entire halls free over the
holidays would improve the efficiency
of the Summer Accommodation
Centre and Letting Scheme.
However, a motion passed by an IC
Union General Meeting last term
strongly opposed the conversion of
any part of Southside into a
postgraduate hall, as was originally
proposed.
The use of Weeks Hall as a
postgraduate residence would have to
be subject to the agreement of
Vickers, the engineering company,
which provided money for its
construction. A condition of the
payment was that Vickers' sponsored
students would be guaranteed places
in the Hall. If the company agrees to
the SRC's suggestions, the proposal
will be put to the College Governing
Body.
Dr Brian Levitt, who chairs SRC,
commented that i f things go
smoothly, Weeks could become a
postgraduate hall for the 1988-89
session.
SRC have also set down new rules
on re-applicants. Dr Levitt said that
re-apps' responsibilities would be
stated clearly before they take up their
places in future. There had previously
been an 'understanding' that re-apps
were expected to help their hall, but
some wardens had felt people were
not doing enough to justify their
second year in College
accommodation.
The Hall and House Committees
will no longer be able to decide who
is awarded re-app places in their
residence. The choice will be carried
out by the wardens alone. In previous
years the committees have voted on
all the applicants and composed a list
of preferred candidates. Wardens
have been able to veto any people they
consider totally unsuitable but not to
add names to the list. Dr Levitt said
that the change was 'not major'and
the decision would now be passed
formally to the wardens but he did not
think that they would appoint re-apps
without first consulting the
committees. 'It would be very
foolish', he said.
However, fears have been voiced
that the wardens will chose people
who will do as the wardens ask but
who will be 'unable to stimulate the
social life of the new residents'. Re-
apps have traditionally been the most
lively and sociable people, who could
be branded as troublemakers by
certain wardens. Dr Levitt defended
the decision, saying that it was
essential that re-apps were there to
help their wardens, not hinder them.
Comics
relieved
The FELIX collection last Friday for
Comic Relief in all departments raised
£192.11. The highest amount raised
in any one department was £52.80
from Mechanical Engineering
followed by £39.01 from Mines, and
£21.23 from Chemistry. At the other
end of the scale Sherfield raised £1.83
(most of that from security men) and
a stunning £1.60 from the whole of
Computing and Mathematics in the
Huxley Building.

thefts
Student property including a compact
disc player and a ghettoblaster were
stolen from Willis Jackson House on
Tuesday. The thieves are thought to
have used scaffolding, which
contractors have left after replacing
roofing lead lost in last October's
storm.
As a result the scaffolding is to be
removed, but in the meantime
students are reminded that common
sense measures such as locking
windows and doors help in preventing
such thefts.
