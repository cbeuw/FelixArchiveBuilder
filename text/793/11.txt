MUSIC
by Phil Young
This week the rise of Red Lorry
Yellow Lorry takes them tonight to the
Astoria for what has to be the gig of
the week; more later. Also tonight the
blues influenced Screaming Blue
Messiahs, currently in the charts
singing about the Flintstones, are
playing at the Town and Country
Club, while the thumping thrash outfit
Stump, play at ULU.
On Saturday, Balaam and the
Angel—heavymetal-come-goth-come-
hippy, play the Astoria. They are
supported by Ghost Dance—ultra-
goths from the old Sisters of Mercy
who aren't in the new Sisters ofMercy
or the Mission, who sing, somewhat
tediously, about death, gloom and
evil.
On Sunday, the Red Wedge gig at
the Mean Fiddler is for me
overshadowed by the Godfathers at
the Town and Country Club. No
nonsense, rock hard and with no trace
of metal, on stage these guys are
characterised by menacing stares and
wild guitar frenzies. Their music has
been alikened to a whirlpool of old
Cult, Clash and old Idol. They'll be
promoting their new album, Birth
School, Work, Death, and expect to
hear the single of that name several
times in the course of the evening!
Album Review: Red Lorry Yellow
Lorry, Smashed Hits
The compilation album by the band
who are the answer to my (musical)
dreams. To give you an idea: take the
old Sisters of Mercy without the mask
of plange and chorus to hid behind;
the deep, rolling covals of Andrew
Eldritch without the tongue-in-cheek
lyrics. Add the anger of the Jesus and
Mary Chain as they used to be. And
the hard, no-compromise lyrics
remeniscent of The Godfathers. Need
I say more? What more can someone
who is not—contrary to rumour—a
goth, but is more goth than anything
else, want? (OK, apart from that!)
This album contains all their better-
known releases—such as Beating my
Head; Hollow Eyes and Chance. Not
as earthy as The Godfathers, more
witty than The Sisters, and more
talented that J&MC, The Lorries
should go far. This should appeal to
all lovers of goth, indie and hard rock.
Get it!
There are four first division games on
in London this weekend, so it gives
a better choice than usual. All games
are on Saturday 13th February with
3pm kick offs (unless otherwise
stated).
Arsenal vs Luton Town
Highbury (Arsenal tube)
The Gunners entertain a side that hit
Oxford for 7 last week, even though
they conceded 4! Arsenal played the
right sort of game at Everton last
week in the Littlewoods Cup Semi-
Final and came away with a slender
win due to the fact that Everton can't
put a penalty away. Man of that match
Tony Adams looked solid and a good
prospect to take on the captaincy of
England in the future. Luton, the T
don't want any away fans because our
Chairman is a Tory MP and likes to
crawl to Thatcher' team have some
good players and lie in the right side
of the Division. The Stein brothers,
Mark and Brian, Mick Harford and
Steve Foster have helped to mould
Luton into a force to be reckoned
with. I think a draw is likely but
Arsenal could nick it with a bit of
luck.
Charlton vs Wimbledon
Selhurst Park (Norwood Junction BR)
A London derby between two of the
most poorly supported Division One
clubs. There won't be much of a
crowd but this doesn't prevent the
match from throwing up a little
action. Charlton are still rooted to the
foot of the table and can't really see
them moving up. Wimbledon are
having another good season and
Bobby Gould has taken over where
Dave Bassett left off. Fashanu is on
the verge of the England squad and
could provide the punch to give the
Dons the three points.
1 i r. ^ , m _
Chelsea vs Manchester United
Stamford Bridge (Fulham
Broadway tube)
This is the repeat of the recent FA
Cup 4th Round tie with the Blues
being home this time and eager to
seek revenge for the Reds 2-0 victory.
Chelsea have not won in the league
since October 31st and have fallen to
14th in the league. They came back
from 2-0 down at Forest last week but
were unfortunate to lose 3-2. United
scraped a 1-0 victory last week, due
to a 4th minute goal, but Brian
McClair, as I have said once before,
is having a good time at Old Trafford
and Olsen still has magical skills. It
has been 30 years since Munich and
the days of the Busby's Babes, will
the Reds ever see days like that again?
The loss of Duncan Edwards, the best
English footballer of all time, and 7
others was movingly shown last
weekend on TV and showed how the
fans had so much passion for the
game. Manchester to win late on.
West Ham United vs Portsmouth
Boleyn Ground (Upton Park tube)
Two of the middle of the table boys
draw swords to battle it out to the end.
Pompey won the previous encounter
between these sides, their first win for
27 years.. .in the top flight of course.
The Irons showed a steel defence at
Liverpool last week to become the
first side to hold them twice this
season and Tom McAllister was
superb. Pompey have chemistry
graduate Barry Home in their side and
I am told that he is a man to watch
in the future. They won at home for
the first time for over three months
in the league last week beating the
worst current form team Derby. Top
signing Ian Baird will probably sit it
out on the bench as he is unable to
oust Mick Quinn or Connor. The
Eastenders should obtain revenge and
wipe up the points.
SUNDAY 14th FEBRUARY
Brentford vs Fulham
(Griffin Park—Brentford Central BR)
This London Third Division derby
has been put back a day in the hope
of attracting a bigger crowd. Player-
manager Steve Perryman has helped
his side into a position that could
possible lead to promotion with a
nicely timed run. Fulham are left with
the enviable plight that they must
spend yet another season in the lower
reaches. They were on the brink of
top league football a few years ago,
but times have changed and things are
not too rosy at the Cottage. Brentford
to take the points.
Game of the day: Chelsea vs1
Manchester United
