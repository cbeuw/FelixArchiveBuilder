This issue is one of 'specials'. If I had
to recommend a page to read it would
be the feature on Superconductivity
(page 7). Thii recent development
could have far-reaching effect on us
all in the near future.
Money
Due to the FELIX financial position,
I will be keeping the number of pages
each week to a maximum of 20. This
means features and reports may have
to be 'stock-piled' or edited down. If
you object to this happening to your
article, please write the objection at
the top. We will try to please as many
people as possible but, of course, it
is impossible to please everybody.
Sneaky syd
Mr Harbour-Bridge, formerly Ian
Howgate, keeps on threatening to take
an anti-FELIX motion to a Union
General Meeting, but never does in
the end 'due to lack of time to write
a report'. This is getting ever-so-
slightly tedious. I would suggest that
if he has a valid motion to put forward
that he does so at the next UGM, in
the usually manner—submitting it five
days before the meeting. Otherwise,
will he please shut up and concentrate
on doing his own job properly.
Valentine's Day
Love and kisses to all my boyfriends,
especially Derek, John, Nick, Paul,
Simon, Egbert, Helmut and David.
