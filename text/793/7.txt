What is a superconductor?
Superconductors are the materials
which, when they are cooled below
a certain temperature, display zero
resistivity. The electrical current pass
through the body of a superconductor
without any loss of energy at all. An
important feature of these materials
is that they exclude any magnetic field
that would normally penetrate them.
This is called.the Meissner effect or
perfect diamagnetism.
Why is superconductivity
important?
Using superconductors we can use
electric current without any losses due
to resistance. Powerful magnets can
be made which are used in medical
equipment (NMR), particle
accelerators, magnetic separation,
magnetic levitation trains and other
applications with a lower cost than if
conventional electromagnets were
used. Moreover, there are
applications such as very sensitive
magnetometers which could not even
exist without superconductivity.
Today, the conventional
superconductors represent a market of
£110 million'($200 million) a year
and, it is estimated, this will increase
to £930 million ($1,700 million) a
year by the end of the century.
Ceramic Superconductors:
The new generation
Until 1986, the materials which were
used were only superconductive
below 13 to 23K (-260 to -250°C),
so liquid Helium with boiling point
at 4.2K was the only coolant that
could be used.
In September 1986, Bednorz and
Muller published a paper announcing
the discovery of an oxide which
became superconducting at 30K under
the modest title:'Possible High To
Superconductivity in the La-Ba-Cu-
O system'. It made a great impression
on the scientific community and
researchers started experimenting
with these ceramics. The paper was
a breakthrough and in February 1987,
Professor Chu's group at Houston
discovered superconductivity at 94K
in the Y-Ba-Cu-0 system. Bednorz
and Muller were awarded the Nobel
Prize in Physics later in 1987 for their
discovery.
Raising the critical temperature to
94K is very important, because liquid
nitrogen can now be used for cooling
since its boiling point is 77K. Liquid
nitrogen is ten times cheaper than
liquid helium and much more easy to
handle. It costs about the same as
milk.
Following this discovery many
universities and companies around the
world set up research teams. Up to
the end of 1987 there had been no
success in the search for new
materials with critical temperatures
higher than 94K. However, much
progress has been reported on the
knowledge of the structure, the
properties and the fabrication of these
materials.
According to recent newspaper
reports, a new compound consisting
of Al-Bi-Ca-Cu-Sr-0 has been found
to be superconducting at 114K, but
this has yet to be confirmed by any
scientific publication.
circuits of microchips have recently
been made experimentally in Japan,
using integrated circuit technology.
Many of the above methods are
being tried by research staff of the
Imperial College. A demonstration of
superconductivity took place during
the RSM Open Day last term, where
pieces of magnet floated over
superconducting pellets as a result of
the Meissner effect.

S U P E R C O N D U C T O R S

Scientists use every possible
technique to study the characteristics
of YBajCUjO^g (the so-called 1-2-3
compound) from methods like
Thermogravimetric Analysis (TVA),
M-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)
and Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) to the most sophisticated like
Neutron Powder Diffraction and High
Resolution Electron Microscopy
(HREM).
interest are the following facts:
President Reagan proposed a
superconductivity initiative consisting
of eleven points for 'the promotion of
greater cooperation among
government, academia and industry;
encouragement of the private sector
more rapidly to commercialise
scientific advances and improved
protection of the intellectual property
rights of those working in the field'.
The research for new compounds
is extensive and many groups have
substituted the elements of the 1-2-3
compound hoping to produce a
compound with a high critical
temperature. In fact substitution for
Y gave encouraging results, but the
new compounds made with Ho, Eu,
Gd, Nd, Er and other rare earth
elements do not display
superconductivity at temperatures
exceeding 93-94K.
For experimental samples, the
fabrication of the 1-2-3 compound
simply invoves the mixing and firing
of Y 2 0 3 , BaC03 and CuO. In order
to improve the quality of the material,
however, more complex processes are
now being used like freeze-drying,
sol-gel, coprecipitation, spray-drying
and others.
Another interesting view of the
subject is the fabrication of thin films
by methods such as sputtering and
metallorganic deposition.
Experimental superconducting
The Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) of Japan founded
an 'International Center on
Superconductivity', providing money
for and having the support of many
Japanese companies. It has been
reported that the funds are around
$50million.
Britain has just named Cambridge
as a 'Superconductivity University
Research Centre' and has also
approved many research programmes
including that of Imperial College.
The SERC has committed £2million
in the form of grants.
At Imperial, the Departments of
Materials, Physics, Chemistry are all
involved in the research of
superconductivity. Their research
groups meet regularly in order to
coordinate the research, to inform one
another on the progress that has been
made and to discuss the problems that
arise. Their results have been reported
at a conference in Bristol and at
another one in London in December.
The Meissner Effect: A magnet is
levitated over a superconducting
surface. The superconductor, cooled
with liquid nitrogen to 77K (-196°C)
expels the magnetic field and makes
the magnet levitate.
