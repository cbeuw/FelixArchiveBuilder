No more Vice
Lachie Stuart, sabbatical Vice
President (Services) at the University
of London Union (ULU) was forced
to resign last Tuesday after a No
Confidence Motion was passed at
ULU's governing body, General
Union Council (GUC).
The motion was proposed by the
Sports and Societies Councils at
ULU, and alleged that Mr Stuart was
continually out of the building on
'business which is not directly
concerned with ULU affairs, had not
produced any campaigning publicity
of consequence since taking office and
that he had not been carying out other
duties he is responsible for'. They
also claim that since he is standing in
the forthcoming National Union of
Students (NUS) elections, he will
have even less time for ULU in the
future.
In his defence, Lachie admitted that
he had done nothing for Sports and
Societies, but felt that he could only
interfere anyway, and they were
better running themselves. He also
claimed that although he had not spent
much time at ULU, he was spending
his time travelling around the
constituent colleges, and this was a
more important part of the job.
The motion might not have been
heard at all, as it was proposed that
the motion was unconstitutional. It
was put forward as an 'emergency
motion' that, under ULU rules, has
to be submitted at least 24 hours in
advance. However, Mr Stuart did not
hear of the motion until the meeting
itself, despite there being an
Executive meeting the night before at
which both the proposers of the
motion and Mr Stuart were present.
The meeting did vote to accept the
motion, and then went on to pass the
No Confidence Motion by the 2
/3rds
majority that requires Mr Stuart to
resign.
At the same meeting, GUC voted
for motions supporting the nurses
strike, the campaign against clause 28
in the Local Government Bill banning
'the promotion of homosexuality', the
campaign against the Alton Bill
limiting abortions to 18 weeks, and
the right of students to September
resits.

UCCA figures
Despite the 2.1% decrease in the
population in the 18-19 year old age
group in 1986-87, the number of
home applicants remained almost
constant, thanks to an increase of
1,500 women candidates. In total last
year 69,035 women and 83,495 men
applied.
The UCCA figures also show that
women applicants rose by 12% to a
total of 22,726, with an increase in
applicants from women in Eire from
1,740 (1986) and 4,033 (1987).
Diary of an
Imperial prof
University academics around the
country are being asked to keep a
detailed diary of how they spend their
working time. Planned by the
University Grants Committee (UGC)
and Committee for Vice Chancellors
and Principals, the survey should
show how much time academics
spend on research and teaching. This
initiative comes after increased
pressure on the UGC to justify the
funds it spends on research. The
Department of Education and Science
may take heed of a suggestion by the
Research Councils that up to 5 % of
the UGC budget should be moved to
their budgets.
Reform Bill
Tory rebels in the House of Commons
have argued that the timetable for the
Education Reform Bill may allow
insufficient time to debate on Higher
Education.
There are grave fears for the
proposed Universities Funding
Council which the Royal Society and
British Academy claim threaten
excellence and innovation. Paddy
Ashdown MP described the Bill as
one of the most dangerous pieces of
legislation for the past fifty years.
Chris Hawkins M P said that
autonomy in British universities was
under threat, and pointed out that one
in six university staff had lost their
jobs between 1979 and 1987 whilst
the Department of Education and
Science had lost two. Education
Secretary Mr Baker claimed that
opposition MPs were attempting to
talk out the Bill.
Catastrophe
The College Finance Section has been
thrown into disarray since a
'catastrophic failure' of the disc sub-
system on January 4th and 5th,
followed by a second one on January
10th this year.
The last print-outs to be sent out to
departments was for the period up to
November 19th 1987. It has also
proved impossible to process staff
expenses or payments to suppliers
since the beginning of the year, with
suppliers refusing to deliver until bills
are paid.
John Davidson, College
Administrative Secretary claims that
they have had to contend with
'significant hardware failures, caused
by an earlier power supply problem,
combined with operator errors and
systems deficiencies have corrupted
the database on which the finance
system is based'.
Meanwhile, the Union is planning
to raise the matter of last year's audits
which have still to be processed at
today's Finance & Executive meeting.
The Union's audit should have been
completed by November last year but
most major sub-committees of the
Union still have their books to be
looked at by the auditors.
Boycott
Scientists may boycott research
funded by the Department of Health
& Social Security if ministers try to
use new powers to block fundings
which would be politically
embarrassing.
All DHSS contracts now state that
scientists must get the Department's
permission before publishing any
results. Up until then, scientists have
had the final say on publication of
their findings, provided the Secretary
of State is given the opportunity to see
and comment on their work.
