THE RAPE OF
CERRO TORRE
Every now and then there emerges a mountain or
climb that captures the imagination of all—climbers
and public alike. The Eigeruand, the Matterhorn,
Everest and the Old Man of Hoy are just a few that
come to mind. In a somewhat different sense, Cerro
Torre has earned a reputation and in many ways a
notoriety that attracts publicity and brings mountain-
eering into the realm of the popular press.
Cerrb Torre is a steep
and savage mountain peak
which stands just over
10,000 feet in the remote-
ness of the Patagonian
Andes. Despite its rather
meagre height, this vici-
ous fang of rock and ice
has for some time been
the epitomy of the unat-
tainable summit and has
recently been at the centre
of one of the greatest con-
troversies known to the
mountaineering fraternity.
In December 1970, the
South East ridge of Cerro
Torre was first climbed by
an Italian party led by
Casare Maestri, thought
by many to be Italy's top
climber. What put the
wheels of discontent into
motion was that Maestri
achieved his aim by arm-
ing himself with a com-
pressed air drill which he
hauled up the ridge by
means of a winch in order
to place no fewer than
three hundred expansion
bolts. In doing this,
Maestri was heavily criti-
cised by climbers in many
countries of the world
though few were aware of
the extent of his tactics.
Last winter, an Anglo-
Swiss party led by Leo
Dickinson went out to
make the second attempt
on the South East ridge.
What they found was not
encouraging—the moun-
tain had been reduced to
a debris of ironmongery
which Maestri had initiat-
ed in order to facilitate
his climbing. Long ladders
of expansion bolts were in
place in holes that had
been artificially drilled in
a manner akin to the bom-
barding of the rock with
heavy machine gun fire.
Not only was the exist-
ence of this continuous
line of artificial aids
damning enough in itself
but much of it had been
placed where the rock
abounded in natural fea-
tures which could have
been climbed "free". By
means of these tactics,
Maestri had reduced to
nothing the element of
chance which is inherent
in all good climbing and
had taken the limit of
artificiality beyond its nat-
ural limit.
Dickinson's party failed
just short of the summit
at a point where Maestri's
bolt ladder magically pet-
ered out leaving a most
impossible looking head-
wall of ice apparently un-
touched. Dickinson return-
ed to England with amaz-
ing evidence of this dese-
cration of the mountain,
and some doubt was even
voiced as to whether
Maestri, despite every-
thing had actually reached
the summit at all.
Tonight (Tuesday) Leo
Dickinson, who is by pro-
fession a photographer,
will be coming to l.C. to
give a talk on Cerro Torre
illustrated with some 400
of his most excellent col-
our slides. The lectures
will be in
LECTURE THEATRE "A"
—COLLEGE BLOCK
at 8.00 p.m.—TONIGHT.
So whether you're in-
terested in climbing or
just like seeing exciting
pictures, come along to-
night and you will find the
lecture indeed worth-
while.

Welcome to Rag Week!
Yes folks, you read aright, your eyes did not deceive you, Rag Week is here again.
Starting on 18th November ten days of fun, entertainment and excitement. Minimum
charges, maximum pleasure.
The aim of Rag this year is to raise money for the following four charities:
ACTION FOR THE CRIPPLED CHILD
IMPERIAL CANCER RESEARCH FUND
COUNTDOWN CAMPAIGN
KASTUR
Various stunts have already taken place on alternate Saturdays of this term, as all
you avid followers (if not supporters) of Rag will know.
On 7th October 150 members of the tliree constituent colleges of IC assembled at
Marble Arch ready with tiddlywinks and collect'ng tins. Objective—tiddlywink down Oxford
Street and Regent Street as far as Eros, and! at the same time to collect as much money
as possible. On this occasion £350 was collected for Action for the Crippled Child and Im-
perial Cancer Research.
On 21st October another crowd of eager stuntsmen, or rather 'chars' equipped with
pans, brooms and loo brushes effected a mass clean and brush up of Oxford Street,
Knightsbridge and Kensington High Street. In doing so they realised £260.
Two weeks later a competition was organised in which the various departments took
part, each dept. organising a stunt — the winner being the one raising the most money.
Amongst the crazy schemes dreamed up and performed were rolling barrels down Oxford
Street, a pedestrian speed trap (unwary passers-by were fined if they were not walking at
exactly 1
1 miles per hour) and an escaped 'madman'from a lunatic asylum. From all these
a total of approximately £500 was raised for charity. The winner was Mining and MinTech 1
with their free rides round Trafalgar Square in Clem, who collected £140.
Later in the afternoon, a few aspiring 'Guy Fawkes' went along to Westminster and
attempted to "blow up" the Houses of Parliament. Their efforts did not (unsurprisingly) go
down well with our beloved upholders of peace and law.
So far, IC has raised about £1300 . . . can we make it up to £3000 by Christmas?

Rag week starts off with a 3-legged pub
crawl and a disco on Saturday 18th. On
the 19th, in the Great Hall at 7.30 the Stu-
dent Society present an orchestral concert.
Last year this was one of the most popu-
lar events, and the evening was a terrific
success—everyone enjoyed themselves im-
mensely. This year the soloist at the piano
is JOHN RUSSELL, conducting will be
Ron Goodwin, also appearing are John
Scott, Muir Mathieson and Michael Reed.
For those of you who are considering at-
tending this performance (it is well worth
your while) tickets are on sale at the Union
Office and also at the Union offices of the
constituent colleges. Prices £2, £1.50, £1,
75p, 50p,40p and 25p.
For 25p on Monday 20th you can come

at 8 in the Great Hall. There will be two
groups appearing, Siddartha and Munch.
The winner of the Rag Queen contest wins
a double ticket to the C&G Rag Ball on
Friday 24th. The drag Queen contest will
certainly be good for a laugh—come and
see mistresses Patrick, Newman, Tenner,
Nuttall and Lolly. The contest will be com-
pered by a famous TV personality.
There will be two showings of the really
great film "Soldier Blue" on Tuesday 21st
in the Great Hall. Entrance 15p, perform-
ances at 7 and 9.30.
Come and laugh, collect money, donate
money or take part in the grand "Chariot
Race" starting at Speakers' Corner at 2
p.m. on Wednesday 22nd. Later on there'll
be a darts match in the QEC bar where
ragsmen will also try and drink the bar
dry. And there's the RCS Smoking Concert
for the debaucherous amongst you.
The grand event of Rag Week, the City
and Guilds' Rag Ball, takes place on the
24th (Friday). Argent and supporting acts
will be appearing, there'll be a film, and
the ball will go on all night. The bar will
be open until 4 a.m. Tickets £1.25 at door,

plan of the route opposite. Obtain spon-
sorship forms from your social rep. Starts
at 2 p.m. from Maria Assumpta. The route
is 12 miles long.
On Tuesday, 28th, we're having a party
on the Circle Line. Everyone should meet
in the bar at South Ken station. We board;
a train on the Circle Line — music, booze,
dancing, balloons and streamers — until
we're thrown off. Also, on the Monday,
there will be a party outside Buckingham
Palace to celebrate the Queen's 25th Wed-
ding Anniversary.
