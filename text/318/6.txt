Theatre
Somewhere, in the depths of 'I and Albert'
(Piccadilly) there lurks a very good basis for a
play, or even a musical. Basically 'I and Albert'
(can you think of a worse title?) covers Vic-
toria's reign, from the time that she takes the
Throne (song), though her meeting Albert (song),
the Great Exhibition (pageant and song), Crimea
(disillusion), Albert's death (melancholy song),
to her Diamond Jubilee (big company number),
but the feeling left after all this pageantry, is
one of emptiness.
The basic problem is one
of cohesiveness, for this
show tries to be all things
to all men—a heavy drama,
a costume drama and a sat-
irical song-and-dance all in
one. There is a finely con-
structed sense of fluency
in the production, with
scenes linked in an ingen-
ious variety of ways. The
Coronation procession leads
off, Victoria steps from be-
neath her crown into the
next scene as her train is
carried off by her entour-
age. The setting too, is ex-
traordinarily adaptable, with
the best back projections 1
can remember in any show,
but unfortunately all this
ingenuity only highlights
the weak points.
Regrettably, weak points
really do abound. Most of
the acting is pretty adomin-
able, with the very notable
exception of Lewis Fiander
as a cynically amusing Lord
Melbourne, and later as a
charming and conjuring
Lord Melbourne. Polly
James (she was Beryl in
'The Liver Birds') tries hard
as Victoria, and Sven-Bertil
Taube may be right in his
portrayal of Albert—-I dun-
no, I never met the fella.
But otherwise, the cast giv-
es the impression of having
been in this play too long,
and being thoroughly bored
by it (and this was only
the third night). The script
is never impressive, and
frequently brash, the lyrics
are largely eminently forget
table, and so are most of
the tunes. There are a
couple of presentable
songs, notably "I've heard
the bloody 'Indoos as it
worse" sung by a London
crowd, and the song that
Disraeli sings as he con
jures up his policies in front
of the Queen—but these
sparks of inspiration are
lost in the mass of medioc
rity that surrounds them.
But, as I have said, there
are the makings of a play
here, if radically differently
handled, for the director
John Schlesinger of "Mid-
night Cowboy" fame,- has
tired to present too many
faces. The best sketches
are those in which Victoria
and Albert play smaller
parts (or none at all) and
the show rams its tongue
firmly into its cheek—Mel-
bourne and Palmerston plot
ting, and the Army fight-
ing in the Colonies for "The
Widow at Win'sor". The
format (or lack of it) of
'Oh! What a Lovely War'
would have been very suit
able, but, as it is, the show
presented is so obviously
designed for the influx of
American tourists, that it
would find a far happier
home on Broadway than in
the West End. Or Broad
moor. Or anywhere.

Classics
Following the expulsion of Soviet diplomats
from the U.K. last year, there was a freeze on
cultural exchanges between the two countries.
Performances to have been given by such
famous artists as Sviatoslav Richter and David
Oistrakh were cancelled.
Earlier fin 1971, however,
during the London Sym-
phony Orchestra's tour of
the Soviet Union plans had
been made for a series of
concerts in this country
under the title "Days of
Music of the USSR".
The freeze has apparently
thawed, for the opening
concert of the series was
held on Tuesday, 7th
November, at the Festival
Hall, with the LSO under
the baton of Evgenyi Svet-
lanov.
The choice of the Over-
ture, Russian and Ludmilla
by Glinka to open the
evening proved to be ideal.
The perfect harmony be-
tween conductor and or-
chestra and the resulting
fine playing of this lively
piece set the mood for the
evening.
The programme con-
tinued with the all tirnfe
favourite, the Tchaikovsky
Piano Concerto No. 1 (yet
again!). As with so many
other concertos the soloist
has open to him two pos-
sible interpretations of the
piece — either as a vir-
tuoso exercise or as music,
the mood and spirit of
which are set by the pian-
ist.
Emit Gilels seemed to
have opted for the former.
Though his performance
was technically brilliant, he
seemed obsessed by a
breakneck tempo, as if
determined to set a record
for the fastest performance
of all time.
Luckily by the third and
final movement, the wild
tempo of the playing had
somewhat calmed and this
combined with the perfect
keyboard technique for
which Gilels is so famous
provided a less intense
ending to the performance
If applause can be used as
a measure of enjoyment
then the audience were well
pleased, in spite of the ex-
cesses.
The best was yet to
come. The Shostakovich,
Symphony No. 5 is a fine
work of imaginative and
distinctive quality and the
performance on Tuesday
evening was superb. Mr.
Svetlanov demonstrated
how he could build up the
intensity of the music and
generate a tension across
the whole concert hall.
Perhaps the most im-
pressive of the 4 move-
ments is the third, the Largo
with its unusual instrumen-
tal features where the LSO
gave their very best. With-
out doubt the success of
this performance of the
symphony stemmed from
the delicate balance of the
rather stately music and its
fine interpretation by an
orchestra under the com-
plete control of its con-
ductor.
Records
This is, for me, a particularly difficult Album
to review, as many of the tracks aren't the sort
of music that I would choose to listen to. More
knowledgeable people than me have of course
been singing Home's praises for many months
now and the standard of playing on this, their
second album, is surprisingly high considering
that none of them have had previous experience
with "name" bands—which would suggest that
they've reached the "threshold of stardom"
purely on the excellence of their music. But I
find that some of the tracks just become back-
ground music because of the vocals, which are
so much like those of America it almost seems
deliverate (who were America? Oh, they were
this incredibly banal group who vanished from
the pope scene this summer . . . ) My immediate
reaction is just not to listen.
However, that's my prob- harmonies .
lem. This album is going to
set Home for greater things
and is even as I write, sell-
music on it to cater for
nearly every taste. I really
like parts of it myself. The
first track on the album is
also my favourite; called
Dreamer it snorts along at
a cracking pace. The guitar
is reminiscent of Albert
Lee of Heads Hands and
Feet. Its best description
would probably toe funky:
this probably means little
to most of you. So I'll ex-
pand — the guitars and
drums keep the same, very
precise time for most of
the number and it sounds
as though it was rhearsed
at great length. It would
make a good single, if it
isn't already. The rest of
side one doesn't have a
track to match the
"Dreamer". "Fancy Lady,
Hollywood Child" has nice
romantic lyrics (a cruel re-
view would describe them
as "true") but the tracks
sound rather similar to my
heavy ears. It's those vocal
Side Two is musically
more interesting, with more
emphasis being placed on
instrumentation than on the
schmaltzy vocals — there
are even some freaky
sound effects and technic
ally "clever" stereo switch
ing at the en dof "West
ern Front" while "Baby
Friend of Mine" contains
a nice unison passage be-
tween electric and acoustic
guitars. The album reaches
a climax of sorts on the
final track "Lady of the
Birds" in that the group
reaches a peak in playing
proficientcy and produc
tion, but it seems that
they're always holding back
and deliberately restraining
any emotion in the music
If the track could have
been lengthened (although
it already lasts about eight
minutes) the result could
have been really satisfying
both for group and listener
Still, I expect they sound
better live and I'm looking
forward to seeing them.

except me.
"Matching Mole's Little Red Record" (CBS)
"What's brown, goes underground, is myopic?
It's the mole!"
Matching Mole was born
when Robert Wyatt left the
Soft Machine because of a
difference in musical pol-
icy. The name itself is from
the French, "Machine
Molle" meaning "Soft
Machiine".
On first listening their
Mole's Little Red Record"
doesn't make any real im-
pression. Indeed, the lyrics
seem completely incompre-
hensible. However, on fur-
ther listening one begins
to appreciate the intricate
touches of Dave McRae,
keyboards (in fact he, more
clumsiness of Nucleus on
than Wyatt, seems to lead
the band) although he is
not given enough time on
record to expand his solos.
His playing is much freer
than his predecssor Dave
Sinclair, who played on the
first album. One begins to
appreciate the excellent
bass playing of Bill Mac-
Cormick especially on
"Flora Fidgit" which he
wrote. This track com-
prises electric piano, syn-
thesiser and bass. One
even begins to enjoy the
warmness and innocence of
Roberts lyrics, and voice,
especially on Righteous
Rhumba and God Song.
Both were written by gui-
tarist Phil Miller whose
playing is precise and
tasteful throughout the
album. It is rumoured that
the band is on the po'nt of
splitting up, which would
be a shame, since the band
come more widely known
and appreciated.
A pleasant record, amus-
ing in places, highlighted
by McRae's keyboard work.
Your Stars
In General. This week is definitely not good for
Arsonists, from the weather report. But from
the stars, it is obvious that you do not sell
your soul this week, as an increase in demand
is foreseen in the far-sighted future. If you
can lay eggs, you are a chicken, or duck-
billed platypus, or having us on.
Aries. Refute any claims to indigestion, as they
belong to someone else (see Capricorn, or
turn over the page). Should you come into
contact with elephantitis, buy a wheelbarrow.
Taurus. Beware of false pieces of wood and
strange men with stones. Later in the week,
thinking about herbaceous borders, and decid-
ing on what to do about them could result
in problems. Your lucky colour on December
the 17th is puce.
Gemini. Walking backwards is inadvisable on
Friday. On any other day, however, it could
lead to a new friendship, and a visit to a
well-meaning stranger with teeth.
Cancer. Attempt to shake up your golf, and pro-
duce a forward drive. If you do not play golf,
buttering scones with a one-legged spoon is a
good substitute, and could reap financial
reward.
Leo. Under no circumstances attempt to dig
holes between any chair-legs in the next seven
years. Resulting hole could become an ob-
session, and destroy a romance. Remember
to cut your toenails at midnight.
Virgo. This week is a good week for the man
production of puddings. Do not, however
undergo any form of scalp treatment, or an
old friend will not recognise you, and neither
will the dog. Remember, Christmas is coming.
Libra. This week will see you striving to keep
a balance between two extremes (i.e. punch-
ing holes in buckets and gnashing teeth while
sipping soup.) Or something like that.
Scorpio. Gobbling peanuts could be disastrous
for your ego, or maybe chicken bones have
more to explain. Drink dynamite for dynamic
effects.
ntarius. This next week will depend very
much on you, or anyone who interrupts the
News with startling revelations. It is in your
favour to eat.
Capricorn. If you have a friend who is an Ariean,
do not venture too deep into the desert this
week. He/she/it may have indigestion to pass
on to you.
Aquarius. Do not walk around in treetops, or
barrels of turgid carrots and banana splits.
Try, instead, to involve yourself with washers
on bath taps.
Pisces. Do not become submerged in baskets of
exotic fruits.

NERVE by Dick Francis (Penguin, 30p)
It looked like the finish for Rob Finn. A brief
spell of brilliance, then last for race after race.
Had his nerve really gone?
Was it dope?
Or was—the reason so twisted it didn't even
bear thinking about.
Well, if you finished that
boring twaddle then this is
your sort of novel. If you
read the Daily Express and
adore the Queen Mother
(that's me—Ed) then I'm
beginning to see how Dick
Francis makes his money
—easily.
Perhaps this is the sort
of thriller that you can take
home and not worry about
it if your mother gets hold
of it—nice, safe sex, minor
violence, what more could
one ask for.
Dick Francis weaves a
web of suicide and corrup-
tion in the racing stables
with very little new ideas
of interesting twists to his
plot. The scene is ancient,
the story backyard and the
characters tired. At times I
expected to turn the page
and read " O K , it's a fair
cop guv—I'll come quietly"
but alas I was disappointed.
Instead all I got was lots
of horsey characters play-
ing the heavy criminal type,
over-written as though in a
play they would be over-
acted.
The novel starts quite
reasonably with Art Matt-
hews a fallen (near) cham-
pion jockey messily shoot-
ing himself in the middle of
the parade ring at Duns-
table races. Lo and behold
our hero is standing right
next to him when he does
it—pretty predictable so
far, then read further. Not
only is Art's trainer giving
him the raw end of the deal
but he's not exactly loved
by all the other jockeys—
so who dun it? The story
rolls on like this through
every one of its 224 pages
and it amazes me that Pen-
guin turn out verbiage like
Nerve. Surely there must
be a few more authors who
have never been published
who can do better than this.
Well, I shan't tell you
what it was that was so
"twisted it didn't even bear
thinking about?" but I doubt
if you're in for much of a
surprise. Dave Hobman
