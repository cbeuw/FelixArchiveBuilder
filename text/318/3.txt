DEBAUCHERY
AT GOLDSMITHS'
SRC invades Lewisham
The University of London Union Students' Represen-
tative Council Statutory Meeting at GokSsmiths' College
on Saturday was a deal less impressive than its name
might suggest. In the five and a half hours between
10.30 and 4 p.m. that the Council was in session it
achieved remarkably little.
The President's Report
concentrated mainly on
accommodation in the
Leinster/Camborne and
Hillcrest groups of stu-
dent hotels, on which she
and the ULU Accommo-
dation Officer had made a
survey, as mandated by
the last 'SRC meeting. Joy
Clancy, the President, said
that they had found con-
ditions in the hotels satis-
factory, and there were
few complaints—the ones
that they had received
were justified.
£10 per week
Delegates nearly fainted,
however, when calmly in-
formed that the rent for
rooms in these hotels was
£10 per week per person
partial board. In order to
improve communications
between the Union and the
hotel groups concerned,
the meeting made Pat
Daniels (Bedford) Execu-
tive Member with respons-
ibility for Welfare. She
will liaise with the hotels
and pass on complaints .. .
and see that some action is
taken. People living in the
hotels who are unsatisfied
are urged to get in touch
with her.
Cost of Sleeping
Pete Johns (President of
University College) pro-
posed a motion that in-
creases in hall fees be tied
to the notional element in
the grant. Although this
really only concerns UC,
where they have managed
to avert an increase in fees
by rationalisation, it was
passed without dissent.
Most, if not all of the col-
leges in London have hall
fees lower than the notion-
al element — this is cer-
tainly the case at Imperial.
Getting a Word in
Edgeways
A "delete all and insert"
amendment to SRC policy
on Representation was
passed unanimously. Al-
though seemingly irrele-
vant, several I.C. amend-
ments making no differ-
ence to ithe motion, other
than adding half-an-hour
ito the discussion, were
accepted into the motion.
SRC was then treated
to a lecture onihe Murray
Report by Tony Lake,
who was the SRC's nom-
inee to sit on the Commit-
tee. In view of the em-
bargo until yesterday, he
was unable to specifically
FELIX
xclusive
state what was in the
Report, but in his usual
brilliant style managed to
drop enough hints to give
most of his audience a
pretty good idea of what
to expect, without, of
course, giving anything
away. A model first form,
Council sat and listened to
teacher without interrup-
tion, and in typical first-
form style, failed to think
of any questions to ask at
the end, apart from a skill-
ed questioner from Gold-
smiths'. Tony managed
admirably in long-winded-
ly failing to answer what
questions there were, and
expressed his willingness
to come to college Union
Meetings and explain the
Report when he CAN talk
about what's in it—regret-
tably, perhaps, Imperial
will have Joy Clancy,
President of ULU, instead
at the UGM on Thursday
week.
An extraordinary meet-
ing (aren't they all?) of
the SRC has been called
for next Monday to dis-
cuss Murray and its im-
plications. A Felix reporter
will be there.

ENTS COMMITTEE
TO FACE CENSURE
Li
We can't go on like this"
says Chairman as Ents reveal
£800 profit on term's concerts
Disband Ents, said ashen-faced Dave Amos at Joint Council. Great
idea, echoed several members of council who are still here and shall
remain nameless. Give them another chance, said someone else so
Ents breathed again and set about making good, last year's slightly-
more-than-marginal loss.
The Monday before
Fairport Convention were
due to play they pulled
out, and a loss was sus-
tained on their less attrac-
tive replacements. The fol-
lowing week Dick Heck-
stall-Smith was also a flop,

E THIS
WEEKEND!
The NUS have made a real achievement in persuad-
ing the London Midland and Eastern Region of British
Rail to offer cut-price weekend trips home by train.
Heralded by the slogan "Travel without a hitch"
(urrghh) London Midland Region offers unlimited (well,
no written limit) tickets to Leicester, Nottingham,
Chesterfield, Sheffield, Coventry, Birmingham, Manches-
ter, Wolverhampton and Liverpool. The tickets are
valid for the journey out on Friday afternoon or even-
ing by certain specified trains, with return by just about
any train on Sunday all day or Monday morning.
Tickets are obtainable from St. Pancras or Euston
Station (depending on destination) from 6 days before
you travel.
Prices are as follows:—
St. Pancras to
Leicester £1.65
Nottingham £2.00
Chesterfield £2.15
Sheffield £2.40
Euston to
Coventry £2.05
Birmingham £2.15
Manchester £5.00
Wolverhampton £2.15
Liverpool £4.80
Negotiations have now also been concluded with
Eastern Region, who from this weekend onwards will
be offering 60 seats on trains to Leeds and places en
route to the NUS Travel Service: the price is about
£3.20 return, same terms. However, tickets for these
trains should be obtained from the NUS Travel Service
in Euston Road and not from Kings Cross Station.
From January, there will be 120 seats.
It is naturally essential to the success of the scheme
that ifhe trains be used, so if you live in the Midlands,
and are going home for a weekend, bear it well in mind.
Oh, and don't forget your NUS or International Student
Identity Card when applying for tickets—you'll need it.
Let the train
fake fom brain I
attracting less people than
there had been at the pre-
vious night's disco. The
ashen face of Dave Amos
loomed over the commit-
tee. However, on October
21st Lou Reed gave us a
profit of £400, on Novem-
ber 4 the Status Quo con-
cert realised £80, and on
November 11 another £400
of the general public's
money found its way into
the Ents coffers after the
Osibisa concert. With the
Friday night disco regu-
larly setting new attend-
ance records the profit so
far this year is over half-
way towards equalling last
year's loss, or to put it an-
other way, if they lose
eight hundred quid over
the rest of this year they'll
still break even.
"We can't go on like
this" complained tight-
lipped Ents chairman Paul
Wadsworth. "The Union
still think Ents only makes
money on teensy weensy
concerts which in fact
always lose. Give me Led
Beatles anyday."

New Student Agency
When the new Room at the Toop (RATT) appears
from its wrappers, besides all the commercial ventures
such as Insurance and USK Travel, with high-pressure
sales methods (they won't like that—Ed.) there will be
an outsider. A group of second-year students are start-
ing a record agency, where records may be ordered on
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday lunchtimes. to be deli-
vered normally on the following Tuesday. Since the
Records are purchased straight from the dealers, they
are cheap (15-20% off) and in better condition than
most record shops. No stocks will be held, reducing
costs to a minimum, so all records will have to be
ordered.
Periodically there will be sales of cheap clothes,
loons, etc., and these will be advertised in "Felix".
Orders for any records (perhaps cassettes also) may
be sent to C. F. McCall, Elec Eng 2, prior to RATT
being opened.
