A Forthright
Opinion
Sir—Perusing through Felix
in recent weeks, I have come
to the conclusion that our
college paper is in need of
articles of greater literary
merit. Ignoring this I shall
take up my index finger and
start hitting the keys.
Perhaps the biggest non-
event of the year/century
must be the ICU Presidential
Unelection. It was brilliantly
disrupted by the CCU execu-
tives, or rather that's their
story. I prefer to take this
view. With the academic year
being so far advanced, not to
elect a president becomes a
greater embarrassment than
electing someone of the
calibre of Rob Hermitage. His
personal inadequacies could
be easily covered by Messrs.
Paul T.T.C.C.H. Jowitt and
Martin Oedipus, Schmoedi-
pus, what's it matter so long
as you love your mother.
Black with the help of the
CCU execs. With regard to
IC UGM's, has mcb ever
heard of the Law of Dimin-
ishing Returns?
Turning now to the matter
of Rag. Could someone tell
me how we manage to get
such in ineffectual rag chair-
man (he doesn't deserve cap-
itals) as Pout Horsekiss.
Does he realise the harm he
has done in distributing can
labels which bear no rela-
tion to the laicences he dis-
tributes? I for one do not
look forward to having col-
lectors arrested.
Perhaps he reasons that so
long as he doesn't get nicked
it all matters not (when you
think about it, if you don't
do any collecting you will
never get arrested; this
should worry all the keen
collectors). On a lighter note,
he is a good MA TCH for Rob,
Is it my turn to be Mummy,
Armitage?
Hoping this reaches you as
it leaves me (i.e. unedited),
I remain who I was when
I started,

plied)
P.S. Senator McGovern has
turned down Piers, who
needs to be a millionaire,
Corbyn's request that he
should stand for IC President
as socsoc candidate.
Car Daubing
- Again!
Sir.—I should like to add my
support to those people com-
plaining about the scurrilous
activities of this so-called
l.C.A.P.S. Organisation.
It is this sort of car wreck-
ing activity which gives stud-
ents a bad name, these lay-
abouts need a bit of sense
kicking into them, a touch
of their own medicine, the
noose.
The I.C.A.P.S. stickers are
now on sale in the IC Union
office.
Yours disgusted,
SIR GEP-V.D AARDWARK
(Mrs.),
otherwio* kt».3wn as Andy
Lewcock, rx
hys. 2.
P.S. I am in no way connect-
ed with this car daubing
activity. I deny it all.
Editor's note: Correspon-
dence on this topic is now
closed.
Is the
Editor
doing his
job?
Sir.—On glancing through
the pages of the latest issue
of Felix, I could not help not-
icing the abnormally large
empty spaces between the
various articles. I then re-
membered one of your staff
mentioning that you were
having difficulty in filling
Felix every week, but I sud-
denly realised what was
really missing — advertise-
ments.
Remembering back to last
year and to endless hours
spent at Council Meeting dis-
cussing the pros and cons of
a weekly Felix with sabbati-
cal editor, I recall that the
most important argument put
forward by the Felix staff
then. This was that a sabbat-
ical editor would be required
to spend a large proportion
of his time in persuading vast
numbers of companies to
advertise in Felix, thereby re-
gaining most of the money
spent on extra printer's costs
and, of course, the sabbatical
year.
Reflecting upon this fact,
one wonders whether our
esteemed editor is doing the
job he is being paid for. On
looking through the six issues
of weekly Felix so far pro-
duced, I discovered that there
were no outside advertise-
ments AT ALL (i.e. other
than Bookshop ads, etc.) in
three of the issues, only one
sixth-pag ad. in another, and
two incredibly small ads in
the fifth. It seems that the
only time any reasonable ef-
fort was put into obtaining
adverts was for the first issue
of term when there was the
amazing number of three.
What has our editor been do-
ing for six weeks?
I humbly suggest, there-
fore, that you pull out your
proverbial finger, sir, and
show Union members that
you are capable of earning
your keep before they decide
that they do not wish to sup-
port you—financially or
otherwise.
Yours faithfully,
CHRIS FEARN LEY
P.S. You've got no excuse
for not printing this as I'm
handing it in early enough.
Please do not mutilate it in
any way.
It is clear that you do not
understand the problems of
producing even such a small
publication as FELIX every
week, Mr. Fearnley.
I considered that it was
of primary importance to est-
ablish FELIX in its weekly
slot, and it has taken me
some time to ensure a regu-
lar supply of printable mater-
ial. It takes me in excess of
20 hours a week alone to
type and lay out the copy. At
least another 30 in research,
writing and keeping in touch
with printers advertising
agents and columnists.
Yet I DO find time to go
out in search of advertising.
Unfortunately, being a spec-
ialised publication, it is to
say the least very difficult to
get advertising—and it is im-
possible locally because of
the price. I am therefore now
selling space by features,
which works rather better—
you should see some results
in the HiFi feature in a week
or two. You cannot appreci-
ate the difficulties of space
selling until you try it—why
don't you?
Finally, may I add that ad-
vertising to date in FELIX is
up to the level of £60 net
per issue budgeted for after
all commission, etc., deduc-
tions and I remain optimistic
about the future.
OLIVER F. DOWSON
Mascotry
Remembered
Sir.—Today mascotry has be-
come virtually a thing of the
past. Those colleges who still
possess mascots guard them
so carefully that they appear
very rarely, always under
very close guard.
This has been brought
about by a few colleges
active in "nicking" mascots,
who have not offered their
trophies for return within
two weeks but has stashed
them in vaults or taken them
to far off places — and
usually forgetting them.
Anyone who has read
scrap books of the Union or
talked to old boys will know
that in the past mascots ex-
changed hands regularly and
after amusing chases and
treasure hunts there would
often be a mock battle during
which their mascot was re-
gained.
Those hunts clues would
be found on such places as
Snowdon, Brighton pier, or
even local pubs and bars,
then ending at the capturing
college's union for a water,
flour and soot bomb battle.
I would like to emphasise
that all this happened in less
than three Weeks.
Considering ICU's present
situation in which MIKE
(that's ICU's mascot) has
been taken, possibly damag-
ed, dismantled and since
kept in separate pieces—God
knows where—for two years!
Now QMC, who have Mike,
are demanding £25 for it—
covered in green mould and
engraved.
My personal opinion is that
in the face of present Union
finance we should not pay
such amounts, regardless of
the good causes it may be
destined for. We should be
given the chance to recapture
Mike, without the need for
any acetylene cutters or
thermal lances, etc.
Also after Friday's very
sick events in which Guilds'
Lord Mayor's Show float was
smashed by some irrespons-
ible idiots—in the name of
mascotry? People should be
reminded that certain mas-
cots, especially vehicles, col-
lege and personal property,
are inviolate.
Finally I would like to see
W.H.O. working effectively,
but please, keep things inter-
esting.
Yours, etc.,
MALCOLM S. NEWMAN

ye lower

Sir.—May it please you
to receive notification of the
election of Mister Richard
Llewellyn Lolley as Vice Pres-
ident of the City and Guilds

great moment in the history

streets. As a mark of respect
the Bells located in the Mech-
anical Engineering Depart-
ment AS well as the bell
known as Big Ben will all
sound a peal at eleven
o'clock on the morning of
Thursday, the sixteenth of
November, 1972. The best
listening point is State Apart-

I remain your most dis-
obedient servant,
