FELIX FINANCIALLY
Continuing his series of financial articles, Derek Cummings says
It's their money you're after!
In my last article, you may remember, I dealt
with the reasons why property prices had increased
and why, in my opinion, the apparent levelling off
in prices which w e are now seeing, is only a
temporary lull.
I also promised to examine the problem from
the point of view of a prospective house buyer,
suggesting where money can be borrowed, how
much can be obtained, and how the gap between the
sum raised on mortgage and the actual market price
of a house might be bridged. In the first place, there
are basically four sources from which money can
be borrowed on mortgage. Nine out of ten mort-
gages on private dwelling houses come from build-
ing societies. The other ten per cent are split be-
tween local authorities, insurance companies and
private mortgagors.
Let me start by deal-
ing, briefly, with the last
three.
LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
Currently, they can lend
up to eight thousand
pounds, but, since they
can only do so when
funds are available, they
are a pretty uncertain
source. Furthermore, you
have to live within coun-
cil boundaries, and the
property in question
must be within that area.
INSURANCE COM-
PANIES. If you can find
an insurance company
which does provide a
mortgage service, you'll
find strings attached,
namely an insistence
that you also buy a large
endowment policy to
cover the transaction, re-
gardless of whether you
really need insurance.
PRIVATE MORTGAG-
ORS. Usually tied to the
developers of new hous-
M o r e Rag $tunts
P i c t u r e s
ing estates and apart-
ment blocks. It's doubt-
ful if they'll offer you
anything better than a
building society will
offer.
BUILDING SOCIET-
IES. As a general rule, a
building society will lend
you up to 95 per cent of
their valuation of a
house, provided that 95
per cent does not exceed
three times your annual
salary, and provided the
house is not more than
fifty years old and is
structurally s o u n d .
Lending money for mort-
gages is their raison
d'etre, which is why nine
out of ten mortgages
come from them. Furth-
ermore, there are two
big advantages in con-
sidering a building soc-
iety.
First, you increase
your chances of getting
a mortgage by investing
with a building society,
even before you require
a mortgage. These insti-
tutions always give pre-
ference to their investors
when dealing with mort-
gage applications, and
this is particularly true at
those times when money
is generally in short sup-
ply. Creating this kind of
goodwill, demonstrating
yourself to be a reliable
and financially sound in-
vestor—even though the
amounts involved may
be small—is of enor-
mous value when you are
looking for a mortgage.
And, of course, quite
apart from that, the divi-
dends earned on building
society deposits are
quite a good investment.
Finally, there is no
need, on a mortgage
taken out with a building
society, to buy unneces-
sary life insurance.
But having found
where to get the money,
the question naturally ar-
ises—how much. Well,
it's going to depend to
some extent on the gen-
eral economic climate.
In good times, you can
borrow up to three times
your annual salary; in
bad times, about two-
and-a-half times your
salary. And this leads in-
evitably to the next ques-
tion. Where are you go-
ing to find the money to
cover the difference be-
tween what you raise on
a mortgage and the act-
ual asking price of the
house you want?
BE PREPARED
The first answer might
be a bank, and not
necessarily your own. In-
deed, in my experience,
you'll be better off going
to your bank's competi-
tors. But whichever you
choose, the fundamental
rule is, in the words of
the Boy Scouts, be pre-
pared. Don't simply bowl
along and ask for a lot
of money and expect the
manager to open the
safe for you. You must
present your case as a
business proposition.
Any manager will want
to know the answers to
the following questions.
How much do you want?
What is the money to be
used for? How much,
and over what period,
can you afford to repay
him? You'll also need
to find out how much it
is going to cost you.

Above all, remember
that banks make their
profits by lending you
other people's money.
Present a good case,
and the chances are
they'll agree to your re-
quest.
My second suggestion
is a deal more tricky,
perhaps. But it need not
be, as long as the propo-
sition is, again, present-
ed on businesslike lines.
I refer to your parents.
All right, you may
have an objection to go-
ing to the folks to bor-
row money as a deposit
on your own home, but
the chances are that it
can be done without
harm or embarrassment
to anyone.
If your parents own
their own home, the
bricks and mortar in
which they live are be-
coming more valuable
every day. It's likely they
have paid off the mort-
gage, or have only a tiny
amount to pay.
In either case, they're
sitting on a gold mine.
And, as long as that pro-
perty remains just bricks
and mortar, all the mon-
ey that it represents is
simply dead money. It's
not working for them—
or for you.
Might it not be worth
investigating the possi-
bility of making it work
for you both?
Consider the facts.
Your parents own their
own house. I
t would be
very easy for them to
raise money on it—suffi-
cient to enable you to
buy a house of your own.
Now, your own house is
also appreciating in
value all the time. In two
or three years, you can
sell it at a substantial
profit, using that to re-
pay your parents and
still have enough to put
down as a deposit on an-
other house. Any way
you look at it, that makes
s e n s e . Furthermore,
when presented as facts
and figures, it's not at
all like going cap in hand
for a sub from Mum and
Dad. It can work, and
I've seen it work, per-
fectly amicably and sat-
isfactorily.
These, then, are some
suggestions — and re-
member they are only
suggestions, not abso-
lute answers. There are
a number of other ways
of raising money, but to
discuss them all would
fill one entire issue of
FELIX.
Next term, I shall be
dealing with this subject
in greater detail in my
series of lectures on in-
surance and house pur-
chase, and that may be
the best time and place
for me to answer the
questions which I hope I
have raised.

If anyone ever doubted the truth of what I am
always saying about the real value of money, they
could profitably take a look at the latest govern-
ment statistics about the purchasing power of the
pound.
Figures published in October show that inflation
in the past 15 years has averaged four per cent.
But in the last five years, the rate of inflation has
speeded up to over seven per cent each year.
This is illustrated by a simple table showing what
the pound has purchased, taking 1963 as a starting
point.

What this means is that, if the rate continues
over the next 15 years as it did over the last five,
the pound sterling will be worth a miserable 33p
in 1987. Governments do their best to slow the
pace but even their wildest successes only decrease
the rate of inflation—they do not cure it.
