On Learning how to Love the Bomb
The story of the Manhattan
Project, which saw the
United States lead a team of
international scientists developing
the first nuclear weapon, has gone
down in popular legend: Einstein
(that most cuddly of nuclear
physicists) recommending that the US
begin work on ‘extremely powerful
bombs’, mushroom clouds above the
New Mexican desert, and J. Robert
Oppenheimer quoting the Bhagavad
Gita - it’s all been burned onto our
collective consciousness. Such a
thing was surely a mixed blessing
to playwright Tom Morton-Smith,
whose production detailing the
creation of ‘The Bomb’, Oppenheimer,
has transferred to London’s West
End, following a critically acclaimed
run in Stratford-upon-Avon. When
the public believe that they have a
good grasp on a piece of history - as I
am sure a lot of people do about the
Manhattan Project - it can be difficult
to make them see any other way;
however, with Oppenheimer Morton-
Smith has created a finely scripted
historical drama, which sticks
closely to the truth whilst still being
entertaining, no doubt thanks to the
fine cast of the Royal Shakespeare
Company.
We begin with the Einstein-
Szliárd letter, in which Roosevelt
was warned about the possibility
of Hitler developing an atomic
weapon; as a result, the brilliant J.
Robert Oppenheimer, or ‘Oppie’ -
communist, radical, genius - is called
up to direct a team of internationally
renowned scientists (those working
on the project would eventually
come to include twenty Nobel
laureates). Moving from the west
coast to Los Alamos, New Mexico,
whose empty deserts allow scientific
inspiration to ‘find’ Oppie; as his
passion for the project builds,
Oppenheimer sacrifices his friends,
his family, and his very morality in
pursuit of scientific achievement.
John Hefferman is brilliant as
Oppenheimer, creating a cocktail of
a character who is one part smooth,
sophisticated revolutionary, one
part mad scientist. Ben Allen and
Tom McCall are wonderful in their
respective roles of Edward Teller and
Hans Bethe, one all cold Hungarian
intelligence, the other a model
of Teutonic good-naturedness.
Similarly, Catherine Steadman
brings a bold physicality to her role
of Jean Tatlock, the doomed lover of
Oppenheimer, who first introduced
him to radical politics - it’s a pity,
then, that her part isn’t nearly as
fleshed out as I would have liked.
It is easy, with the privilege of
hindsight, to condemn the naivety
of the scientists involved. When
Oppenheimer claims that the nuclear
bomb would mark ‘an end to all
war’, we can sit smug in our tower
of dramatic irony, surveying the
wreckage of Sarajevo, of Georgia, of
Gaza; but to take such an attitude is to
belittle the intentions of the scientists
involved. What Oppenheimer does
particularly well is help to return the
nuance to the arguments surrounding
the Manhattan Project: it was not a
simple case of American dominance,
but rather a campaign borne out of
the fear that the Nazis would get there
first. The fact that a number of the
scientists working at Los Alamos had
fled the seemingly-unstoppable tide
of European fascism helps to make
the issue a lot more complex than it
may appear at first.
However, there are points within
the production when this desire to
promote debate overstretches itself;
the result is a number of lengthy
near-monologues in which the
characters grapple with the moral
confusion working on such a project
can bring, leading to a runtime which
- at three hours long - certainly feels
like a bit of a drag. Perhaps as time
goes on the cast will be able to deliver
such paragraphs with more pace, but
it seems like Tom Morton-Smith’s
script could certainly do with editing
down. Similarly, there are elements of
the play where subtle symbolism can
spill over into psychological heavy-
handedness: Oppenheimer can’t feel
love for his baby because the bomb is
his child; the shroud of secrecy under
which the project is carried out is
closer to fascism than the socialism
that he so loved; the scientists
always have purely knowledge-based
motivations, while the military (boo!)
are only interested in personal gain.
While these elements don’t happen
too often, they do feel like missteps,
jerking us out of the action with a
sharp tug.
They are, however, partially offset
by the skill with which Morton-Smith
deals with the scientific aspects of

the story - he manages to strike a fine
balance between over- and under-
information. As an audience we don’t
feel spoken down to when the cast
begin describing the structure of the
atom (or at least, I didn’t; perhaps if
you’re studying nuclear physics such
things may seem a bit more slow), but
the theory never takes precedence
over the plot; instead the two aspects
work in perfect tandem, with one
building and developing the other.
This is helped by the clever staging
design, which gives every surface the
ability to become a blackboard - a
clever nudge towards the stereotype
of the genius scientist, madly
scribbling away on any available
space. The set it dominated by the
interlinking girders upon which the
atomic bomb descends during the
Trinity Test; like a pig-iron sword of
damocles, they remind the viewer
that there is only one way things can
end: Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and over
100,000 dead.
Despite what Brian Cox’s popularity
would seem to tell us, it’s still difficult
to make science ‘sexy’ (although
perhaps not physics: the number of
people applying for physics degrees
has increased by 40% over four years).
Therefore, we should applaud director
Angus Jackson, who manages to steer
his RSC cast through a script that,
despite a few areas of weakness, is
generally extremely solid. Subatomic
physics has rarely looked so good.

Theatre until 23rd
