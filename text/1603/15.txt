here support the EU and open door
immigration.”
The Ukip leader advocated for an
Australian style points immigation
system, to give “ordinary working
people an even break” and affirmed
his intentions to withdraw from the
European Union. Mr Farage also
pledged to cut the foreign aid budget,
stop the HS2 “vanity project” and
revisit the Barnett formula because
“Scotland should receive less than it
currently does.”
Farage said that the NHS “should
run as a public service, free at the
point of access” and promised
to reverse the growth of middle
management and scrap hospital
parking charges.
Mr Farage raised the topic of health
tourism, saying that foreign workers
should have health insurance before
they arrive here.
Shortly after this Mr Farage
brought up the 7000 HIV cases in the
UK, and claimed that “almost half”
of the patients were from overseas.
When he Leanne wood gets the first
round of applause for condemning
his words.
Farage repeatedly claimed that
“we can’t do anything” to control
immigration and said that he doesn’t
blame a single migrant for coming
here.
He highlighted issues such as wage
compression and the housing crisis,
but steered clear of the economy
and focused on immigration and
our EU membership as priorities
for the UK. Mr Farage attacked the
six pro-European leaders, calling
them “detached”, “all the same” and
declaring they have “never had a job
in their lives.”
Leanne Wood – Plaid Cymru
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood
stressed that “jobs and services have
been cut to the bone” and declared
that “the austerity experiment has
failed.”
Speaking directly to the Welsh
voters, she promised to offer an
alternative to “balancing the books on
the backs of the poor.”
Leanne Wood relentlessly criticised
austerity, saying that “debt has gone
up despite promises” to produce “so
much pain for so little gain.” At one
point the Plaid Cymru leader told
the audience that “the banks had a
bailout, now it is time for the people
to have a bail out.”
In the next parliament Plaid Cymru
will demand that Wales receive (per
capita) fiscal parity with Scotland.
Leanna Wood criticised Labour
for the “creeping privatisation” and
the introduction of PFIs (private
finance initiatives). She contended
that the “private sector has no role in
healthcare.”
In response to Farage’s comments
on immigration, the Plaid Cymru
leader asserted that the United
Kingdom would not go along with
the “scaremongering” and “divisive
rhetoric.”
In closing, Leanne Wood
underlined that “austerity is not
inevitable. We do have a choice” and
told the audience that “for Wales to
be strong, like Scotland, Plaid Cymru
must be strong. Only they can win for
Wales”
Natalie Bennett – the Green
Party
Natalie Bennett argued that in the
NHS “no public money should go into
private profits” and pledged that the
Green party would “stop slashing at
essential public services” by raising
taxes and ensuring that multinational
companies and rich individuals “pay
their fair share.” She criticised the
government’s efforts for the poor and
told the audience “one in five workers
is on less than a living wage.”
The Green Party leader promised
to “increase the amount we spend
on foreign aid” because “we need a
more secure, stable world.” Bennett
announced that other parties are
“offering two choices: austerity heavy
and austerity light.”
According to the Green party
leader, the NHS is “moving to the
American system,” which is why
the Greens would “take the market
mechanism out of the national health
service.”
Bennett spoke about the
“damaging” debate on immigration
caused by Nigel Farage, and agreed
with other party leaders about the
numerous benefits of immigration.
She went on to mention “the
NHS couldn’t operate without
immigrants.”
Natalie Bennett was the only
leader to mention the environment,
claiming that “we are using the
resources of three planets when we’ve
only got one.”
Ms Bennett spent her remaining
time praising the “huge impact” that
the Green Party’s only MP, Caroline
Lucas, had made in parliament
and urged the public to vote for
the Greens to “deliver a new kind
of politics. A peaceful political
revolution.”
But just how well was this all
received?
Snap polls suggested that Nicola
Sturgeon and David Cameron
had come out on top, but for very
different reasons. Many liked the
aggressive and impassioned rhetoric
coming from Sturgeon, who attacked
Miliband for not being left enough.
David Cameron remains the most
‘prime ministerial’ in the public’s
eyes, after he gave a calm and
convincing argument for voting
Conservative.
Ed Miliband also came out strong
form the debate. He has the most to
gain from participating in a head to
head debate with David Cameron,
due to the expectation game. The
Conservatives and the press have
hugely exaggerated Miliband’s poor
image and the debates give him an
opportunity to confront Cameron
and look the part.
However, in the seven-way
debate he had little time to clash
with Cameron, and had to spent
just as much time being criticized
by Sturgeon, Bennett and Wood
for Labour’s support for further
austerity.
Nick Clegg, arguably one of the best
speakers on the panel, came out with
some appealing lines on why to vote
Lib Dem, and successfully positioned
himself away from his coalition
partner. Painting a picture as the
party that would “add a heart to a
Conservative government and a brain
to a Labour one” might chime with
the electorate, but Clegg’s image is
tainted with large chinks of the public
after the tuition fee debacle.
Nigel Farage gave a pretty poor
performance and caused controversy
his comments on immigrants
suffering from HIV. Natalie Bennett
and Leanne Wood both had their
moments that won over the audience,
mainly on the subjects of inequality
and the “failed austerity experiment,”
and the three women leaders were
very much in agreement on the issues.
However, as the best debater of the
three, Nicola Sturgeon stole Bennett’s
and Wood’s thunder.
There were no major gaffes or
game changing moments during the
debate, and the two-hour discussion
probably didn’t change many people’s
perceptions of the party leaders,
except now there might be a large
number left-wing English voters
who wish they could vote for Nicola
Sturgeon.
