Max Falkenberg finds this Doris Lessing is lacking
"The piece
is let down
by its
needlessly
long
runtime
and lack of
coherence"
If only third time lucky always
worked out. With another long-
winded, lack lustre display from
the Orange Tree, I am starting to lose
patience with Paul Miller’s tenure at
this fantastic theatre.
A rare early work by the Nobel
Prize winning Doris Lessing, Each his
own Wilderness is branded a play about
politics with all the passion usually
reserved for sex. Although there are
a number of interesting and lively
passages, the piece is let down by an
unnecessarily long runtime and a lack
of coherence in deciding its theme.
Set in 1958 London, 22 year old
Tony returns from National Service
to find his mother, Myra, the same
bohemian activist she’s always been.
Cold and disillusioned, Tony’s anger
and deep political scepticism provides
a lively contrast to his mother’s
idealism.
With a supporting cast made up of
Myra’s current and former lovers,
the whole political spectrum is
entertainingly represented. Despite
the political topic of choice - the
H-bomb - having somewhat lost
its significance in the last 50 years,
discussion on the indifference of the
young to politics and the futility of
protest movements stays remarkably
relevant today.
Unfortunately, while the play’s
political message is rather enjoyable
(for those who can stand politics), the
relationship between Tony and his
mother falls a little flat. Unpleasant
and bitter, Tony’s anger comes across
as distinctly adolescent, despite a
superb performance by young RADA
graduate Joel MacCormack. Similarly,
Clare Holden works well in the role of
Myra, but both characters are plagued
by a lack of development from start
to finish.
It also doesn’t help that a number
of the supporting roles are a little
subpar. Roger Ringrose as Mike plays
a naïve, elderly Labour politician who
has been openly in love with Myra for
years. His performance is what one
would expect from such a character
but remains rather unexciting. In
contrast, Phillip, played by John
Lightbody, is a successful architect
with the confidence to match. Having
had a five year relationship with
Myra previously, Myra’s longing for
him is entertaining but adds little to
the play.
For the first half, the cast is closed
out by Sandy, Myra’s 22 year old
lover, and Rosemary, a young girl
engaged to Phillip. In truth, Sandy’s
character is remarkably refreshing;
the same age as Tony, but without all
the unpleasant cynicism, he provides
some urgently needed relief in the
early parts of the play. But the real
nail in the coffin for this production
is Rosemary. Incredibly uninteresting
and childish, it seems Rosemary’s
character has been written into
the play for the sole purpose of
demonstrating what it’s like to be
politically clueless. I really can’t
blame Rosie Holden’s performance
since the character she is given to
work with is dire, but she does little to
find any redeeming features.
The play seems to ramble on stuck
somewhere between the political
and personal for the full two and
a half hour runtime. Without
seeming to reach much of a political
conclusion and with Tony and Myra’s
relationship as frayed at the start
as at the finish, it all feels a little in
vain. The only real highlight, apart
from the brief political commentary
already mentioned, is Susannah
Harker as Milly, Sandy’s mother and
another Bohemian friend of Myra.
Sharp, witty and with a far more
reasonable tone than many of the
others, Milly livens up the second
half. Although there is a fair bit of
tongue in cheek in the first half,
Milly’s arrival really sets the ball
rolling for the more comedic side of
the play.
Despite what I’ve said, I don’t
want to give the impression that this
production is an outright failure.
Particular praise must be handed to
Joel MacCormack whose performance
really is exceptional given what
he had to work with. Equally, the
performances of Josh Taylor as
Sandy and Susannah Harker are
fun and refreshing. The staging and
scenery makes good use of the space
at the Orange Tree, and although the
play’s more intimate moments are
a little lost in the round, the general
atmosphere is enlivening.
Unfortunately, little can be done
to redeem the shaky plot and lack of
development in this frankly under
whelming play. It certainly wasn’t
terrible, it wasn’t even particularly
bad, I just expected so much more
from the Orange Tree.
Each his Own Wilderness is on at the
Orange Tree Theatre until May 16th.
Tickets from £10. Available online...

SECTION EDITORS
Welcome
Back to Felix
Arts!
Yes,it’s term again and whilst you
have all been busy revising hard
in the library or more likely crying
over a tub of ice cream at 3am,the
Arts section has been hard at work
going to press viewings and getting
our hands on all the complimentary
wine we can.And so,whilst this
week’s edition represents a selection
of all that we have reviewed,be sure
to check out the Felix Arts section
online for even more reviews of
what has been going on all around
London.
We start this first issue of exam
term with a slight whimper,as Max
Falkenberg is rather unimpressed
by the play EachHisOwnWilderness
at the Orange Tree Theatre.Long
winded without any clear direction,
this political play falls rather flat,
despite some good quality acting
performances in the main roles.
Despite promising to be an exciting
piece,an underdeveloped plot left
the piece integrally flawed.
Next,Clara Clark Nevola spends
the evening at a fabulous new opera
at the Royal Opera House,Rossini’s
IlTurcoInItalia.A comic opera
containing a farcical love triangle,
this 19th
century piece manages to
stay relevant and hilarious,not just
jokes left back in the past.
RulesforLiving at the National
Theatre may not seem much when
you first glance at the setting,a
middle-class Christmas dinner,but
you are soon pleasantly surprised.
Overflowing with energy,the work
even has its own fight director,
ensuring that it is piece full of irony,
comedy and drama.
Finally,this one might be perfect
for us Imperial students: a play
about science.Telling the story of
the development of the atomic
bomb,Oppenheimer at the Swan
Theatre makes the complex topic of
nuclear physics incredibly accessible,
a refreshing change.Add to that
excellent staging and a gripping
cast,Fred Fyles feels this is certainly
a play to see,one of the best
productions currently out.
So,that’s it for now,make sure
to tune in for next week’s section
where we have an excellent
collection of various opera,art and
theatre reviews on offer.Plus,it
makes for great procrastination so
that,even for five minutes,you can
escape the misery of the library’s
fourth floor and imagine you had
the time to actually go out in the
evening.
