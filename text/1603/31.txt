Facing up to the force of nature
Force Majeure (or Turist if you’re
Swedish), is written and
directed by Ruben Östlund.
It is a disaster movie but not as we
know it. You see, the disaster doesn’t
actually happen. Tomas and his wife
Ebba are on a skiing holiday in the
French Alps with their two children,
Vera and Harry. Young, attractive
and wealthy, they seem to be the ideal
middle-class family.
When an avalanche approaches
with gathering speed, it seems certain
that it will completely engulf the
family.
In a split-second decision, Tomas
grabs his smartphone and runs,
leaving Ebba to protect their
screaming children and brace herself
for the onslaught. It never comes.
What follows is an unflinching,
tragicomic depiction of Tomas’s
return to the family he effectively
left for dead. Clearly he has a lot of
explaining to do. Yet in a disastrous
bid to save face he refuses to
acknowledge running away.
The performances are faultless,
especially from Lisa Loven Kongsli
as the seething Ebba and Johannes
Kuhnke as Tomas, floundering in his
wife’s hostility.

Trailer Watch: Star Wars awakens
With the summer
blockbuster season fast
approaching, it’s time
for Hollywood’s immeasurably
vast marketing machine to get the
ball rolling on showing off the big
upcoming films of 2015.
Causing the biggest splash by a
considerable margin was the second
teaser for Star Wars Episode VII:
The Force Awakens. The first teaser
didn’t offer a huge amount in the
way of details, and while the new
teaser still isn’t what could be called
forthcoming there’s certainly a lot to
take in.
The opening shot is instantly iconic
- a slow pan across a desert planet
that’s since been named as Jakku (not
Tatooine, the series’ previous sandy
landscape) that reveals a downed
X-wing, and behind it, a crashed Star
Destroyer.
There’s a voiceover that sounds
like it might be Mark Hamill’s Luke
Skywalker, taking about the presence
of the Force in his family over shots
of Darth Vader’s melted helmet, Luke
(we think - there’s a lot of speculation
in this trailer) placing a mechanical
hand on R2-D2 and someone
(presumably Leia, going by the
dialogue) being handed a lightsaber.
As the voiceover concludes, the
establishing shots start to come thick
and fast. There’s another look at the
X-Wings skimming across the lake
from the first teaser, replete with a
far more excited Poe Dameron (Oscar
Isaac).
Other highlights include the
first close-up of Daisy Ridley, the
previously unknown soon-to-be-star,
as Rey, as well as confirmation that
John Boyega’s Finn is a stormtrooper
of some kind. Throw in a glimpse of
Kylo Ren, the film’s big bad, more of
the Millenium Falcon and a chrome-
plated stormtrooper, and Star Wars
looks very exciting indeed...

This Week
at Imperial
Cinema
Imperial Cinema are back for the
new term,and with InherentVice
already under our belts we’re
already looking to the Academy
Awards for our next film...
Up next,the Oscar-winning
Julianne Moore stars in Still
Alice,the story of an American
professor diagnosed with early-
onset Alzheimer’s Disease.
Moore is undeniably the
highlight of the film,in a role
that saw her sweep virtually
every Best Actress award going,
but there’s still much more
besides to recommend.
Based on the best-selling
novel of the same name,Still
Alice features an all-star cast
alongside Moore,including Alec
Baldwin,Kristen Stewart and
Kate Bosworth.
Written and directed by
Richard Glazer and Wash
Westmoreland,this intimate,
understated film is a powerful
look at Alzheimer’s and how it
can affect those we love.
Still Alice is playing at Imperial
Cinema on Tuesday 5th
May and
Thursday 7th
May at 19:00.
Tickets are £3 for members and
£4 for non-members.
Doors open around 15 minutes
before the start of the film.

"It’s one
of the
year’s best
releases so
far, and
well worth
a watch."
and insecurity. Östlund suggests
that men are oppressed by society’s
expectation for them to be heroic in
dangerous situations.
Even after overwhelming evidence
to the contrary, Tomas does not
admit that he, as an individual, was
scared. A breezy, “we were terrified”
is the closest he can get, speaking
for his wife and children as a sneaky
employment of safety in numbers.
This film is smart, sharply written
and well-observed, a deserving winner
of the 2014 Cannes Un Certain
Regard Prize.
The only complaint is that it feels
a touch long but this only adds to
the impression of time dragging on
the holiday from hell. It’s one of the
year’s best releases so far and well
worth a watch.
We may all condemn Tomas from
a position of relative safety but until
that situation is upon us, can we truly
know how we would respond?
Östlund’s script cleverly explores
the concept of masculinity and
reverses traditional gender
stereotypes: Ebba is the hero while
Tomas is the coward.
It’s always heartening to see a
strong female protagonist and
Ebba is no exception. She is a well-
rounded character with strength and
incisiveness as well as vulnerability.
She does not wait to be rescued like
a typical damsel in distress, instead
showing courage and demanding the
same of her husband.
She’s not perfect though. She
sidesteps every opportunity to discuss
the avalanche with the children,
presumably because the actual events
are too painful to explain so she
plumps for saying nothing.
Interestingly, the women are the
most sympathetic characters, being
fairly level-headed and reasonable,
while the men are the least likeable
with their fragile balance of bravado
"In a split-
second
decision,
Tomas
grabs his
phone and
runs."
