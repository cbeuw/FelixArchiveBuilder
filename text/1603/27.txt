in Paris, and this is where much of
the capabilities of electronic music
were developed. IRCAM – l’Institut
de Recherche et Coordination
Acoustique/Musique – was a hotbed
of innovation, with computer
scientists and acousticians working
directly alongside composers.
Pioneering work on FM synthesis was
carried out and programmes for the
real-time modulation of sound were
developed (such as MAX). MAX has
been instrumental in the creation of
some of the most important musical
compositions in recent decades, such
as Birtwhistle’s opera, The Mask of
Orpheus. Boulez himself wrote a
number of works in the early days of
IRCAM, exploring the potential for
computers to manipulate sound in
real-time, for example, in ‘Repons’
where a programme is used to
provide an altered echo of certain
instruments.
Boulez’s music is difficult. It is
unlike Mozart or Beethoven or
anything heard before, and has not
enjoyed broad public appeal (yet).
But his contributions are valuable;
his language is objective and free
of any history, it is one of the most
successful responses to the events
and conditions of the 20th
century. If
people complain of its atonality and
difficulty, they should think of music
from other cultures, which can sound
equally alien and provide unequivocal
evidence for tonal systems being the
result of cultural conditioning. In this
way, Boulez’s music can be seen as a
universal music, rooted in the equally
universal language of mathematics.
“The strongest civilisations are those
without memory - those capable of
complete forgetfulness. They are strong
enough to destroy because they know
they can replace what is destroyed. Today
our musical civilisation is not strong”
Universally popular it certainly
isn’t. Boulez’s own diagnosis is
that people use music as a sort of
backdrop to their own thoughts
while his music demands complete
attention. Although unwilling
to compromise on his duties as
composer, as a conductor he has
enjoyed international fame, winning
26 Grammy awards and raising the
profile of 20th
Century music to the
highest acclaim it has enjoyed. In
the 70s he was musical director of
both the BBC Symphony Orchestra
(in London) and the New York
Philharmonic, reinvigorating the
musical life of these two cities. In
New York, he organised ‘rug concerts’
where audiences were exposed to
contemporary music in new ways.
Now at 90 years old, he no longer
conducts, and indeed achievements
in the concert hall were only
transient, but I have no doubt that
his compositions will be remembered
and become more widely understood
in the future.
Personally, I have found exploring
the music of Pierre Boulez to be
one of my most rewarding musical
explorations. In my efforts to
understand this language I have
been taken back in time to medieval
Europe and around the world. While I
am still a huge fan of what historians
call ‘common practice period’ music,
such as Beethoven and Mozart, and
also of more popular styles from
the last decades, I see now how the
immediate appeal of these styles is the
result of lifetime exposure. Attending
the Boulez at 90 events at the
Barbican recently was an important
catalyst in my appreciation. With
a full day of concerts, talks, and
documentaries I was thrown in at the
deep end, but quickly learnt to swim.
I hope you will join me in exploring
the art of one of the most radical and
forceful minds in modern music.
