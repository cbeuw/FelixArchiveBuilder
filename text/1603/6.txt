It doesn’t take much effort to vote
Conversations with friends
around campus have reminded
me that those of us keenly
following the General Election are
in the minority. Hardly surprising
given that it’s exam season, but it
doesn’t take much effort to go and
vote next Thursday. What surprised
me more was how people hadn’t
registered, believing their vote was
either worthless or would not make a
difference.
In case it isn’t obvious enough,
pledges and manifestos from parties
are not about creating a balanced set
of policies for the country, but instead
reaching out to groups of voters who
are likely to vote. Forty one percent of
young people said they will definitely
vote, but compare that with seventy
five percent of over sixties who will
definitely vote; you can see who the
parties really want to engage with.
Pensioners have had a
comparatively easy ride over the last
few years thanks to various policies
set by the Government. Can you
blame politicians for behaving like
this? Probably, but if we are not
voting, we are not holding them to
account and making our views clear.
Students in Nick Clegg’s
constituency have made their views
perfectly clear, with a number of
them planning to vote tactically so he
loses his seat (the sore feeling over a
broken promise of tuition fees does
not wear off, it seems).
Whilst I do not agree with them, I
admire the fact that they are using
their votes to make their views clear.
Without this, we have no way of
holding MPs to account, and no way
to make it clear that we as young
people are as equally important as
other demographic groups.
The act of not voting merely
enforces the idea that we are not
engaged and do not matter. An
undecided voter, however, gives the

Thomas Lim asks why students don’t care about the election
Will our government be reborn this Spring?
In some accounts of the
‘Constantinian shift’ towards
Christianity as the state religion
of the Roman Empire in the 4th
century CE, part of the political
efficacy of the move came through
the assimilation to Christianity
of a variegated iconography and
diverse social practices associated
with older paganisms. While as
historical interpretation such
accounts are a little too ‘Dan Brown’,
the general idea does point nicely
to a bizarre semantic association in
the English language: that of rebirth
and resurrection, largely a product
of the coexistence of the Christian
Eastertide and residues of spring
fertility rituals in rural areas. Both
the main parties seem to have had a
similar confusion about the meaning
of these terms in the run up to the
election.
First comes the return of Tony
Blair to the political scene. It is rare
I find myself in agreement with the
Daily Mail, but surely the man can
only be described as toxic? The one
thing Miliband had going for him
was his opposition to the Iraq War.
Perhaps I overestimate the negative
effect Blair will have; I have friends
who have said that the Labour Party
‘chose the wrong Miliband.’ Since
the estimable socialist intellectual
Ralph Miliband is dead and will
(alas!) probably remain so, one can
only presume that these remarks
refer to the elder brother David:
defender of extraordinary rendition
and other human rights abuses, no
doubt taking the US on faith that
‘advanced interrogation techniques’
such as ‘rectal rehydration’ can’t be
all that bad, really. On the whole,
though, Blair’s resurrection seems to
have been recognised as a bad move.
There is just one nice irony about
the episode: his zombie-like return
to the political scene, just two days
after he no doubt commemorated
the resurrection of Christ, throws
into sharp relief his megalomaniac
identification with the figure who has
become the object of his messianic
faith.
The Tories, on the other hand,
have rediscovered growth economics
but with a catch: we will have more
spending and more austerity! The fact
that the logic of growth economics
requires state intervention during
times of recession to promote growth
and that state spending during times
of growth is at best economically
superfluous and at worst damaging
seems to have largely escaped a
party obsessed with the two contrary
desires of staying in power and a
punitive neoliberalism – which has
historically failed in its promise
to be the most efficient policy for
growth, never mind the most just.
Actually, this criticism assumes that
the Tories are right in thinking that
growth will continue. Yet the ‘great
economic recovery’ we are witnessing
is a less rebirth than stillbirth,
epiphenomenon that it is of the
crisis in Europe. The crisis has made
the City a magnet for continental
surpluses, sanctuary as it is for the
twin pillars of deregulation and
rampant inequality, but the situation
will not last. These pillars have their

politician an opportunity to pander
to them, and the issues which most
concern them. If we do not vote,
we give them the opportunity to
overlook us.
A common complaint is that
politics is stage managed and clean
these days - it all just seems a bit
boring.
We can thank Tony Blair for
starting this unfortunate trend, but a
lot of work has gone in to taking the
spin out of elections, for example the
excellent website voteforpolicies.org.uk
allows you to compare your views on
various topics with the main political
parties.
The constituencies most Imperial
students live in are not particularly
marginal, meaning the chances of the
party elected in that seat changing
are low. This should not make a
difference to whether you vote or
not. When election strategists are
planning their next campaigns, they
will be interested in the demographics
of the electorate, and who votes. By
simply turning up to the ballot box,
we remind them that we exist and are
a group which must be considered.
