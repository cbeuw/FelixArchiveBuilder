THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 11
FELIX 01.05.2015
Everything you need to know to cast your vote
The General Election 2015
Students are taking to the campaign trail too
As a member of the Liberal Youth,
I was invited to go canvassing in
various target seats in the country.
It’s a great scheme where they give
you some money towards travel,
free accommodation and food and
there’s a social to cap things off at
the weekend.
I went to the marginal seat of
Oxford West and Abingdon where
Imperial alumna Layla Moran was
standing.It was a great experience
to find out the inner workings of
political campaigning behind the
scenes.
I was briefed on the local issues
and the work Layla has been doing
over the past few years.Then we
were paired up and started knocking
on doors.What I found is that in an
ultra marginal seat people are more
likely to want to engage in doorstep
conversations although some were
quite shy about expressing the party
they are going to vote for.
This constituency had a right
wing Tory MP in the last parliament
who voted against bills such as gay
marriage so the Liberal voice wasn’t
such a hard sell.Lib Dems have
traditionally banked on strong local
connections and it showed here as
some people commented that they
have heard more about Layla and
her work in the constituency than
their MP.It was quite refreshing to
see people actively willing to engage
in politics and give their views on
NHS,education and housing.
The weekend also gave me a
chance to chat to Layla about her
journey from Imperial to politics.
She highlighted the need for
objective decision making in politics
compared to the ideological policies
that are often pursued by the
political parties.
She spoke in a friendly manner
and was very willing to discuss party
politics with me during lunch.As
a current school teacher she had a
very good insight into the education
policies needed in this country and
was committed to making a positive
impact.Education inequality is an
issue close to my heart and it was
great to learn about the steps the
party is taking to address the issue.
I have always felt a certain
degree of political apathy at
Imperial,perhaps it’s the nature
of our courses and the ideological
showmanship from the political
parties that puts us off from
actively engaging in politics.
Nevertheless,it’s important that
we exercise our right to vote and
make our voices heard in elections.
Engaging actively with political
parties is the best way to influence
policymaking and truly make a
difference in people’s lives.
The Lib Dems policies are
voted on at conference and any
member can put forward a policy
motion to be debates.This gives
an excellent opportunity for
grassroots campaigners to have
a say at the national level.And
the truth is it works.The Lib Dem
policy delivered in this parliament
of income tax cut was originally
proposed at conference by an
ordinary member.
So it’s important that we actively
engage and campaign to get
a better understanding of the
issues facing our society and do
something about solving it.

Imperial’s local constituencies explained

NEWS WRITER
The majority of students at
Imperial (especially those
in halls) are concentrated
in the four constituencies of
Chelsea and Fulham, Kensington,
Hammersmith, and Cities of London
and Westminster. Felix takes a look at
each of them below.
Hammersmith
Hammersmith is currently
represented by the Labour Party’s
Andy Slaughter, the Shadow Justice
Minister. Slaughter was previously
MP for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd’s
Bush from 2005-2010 and is running
for a second term (his third overall) in
the 2015 election.
The latest polling data suggests
Labour will take 49% of the vote,
with the Conservatives in second
with 33%. With a Labour-led council
in the Hammersmith and Fulham
borough, Hammersmith is a fairly
safe seat for Labour.
Slaughter’s main campaigns
revolve around the A&E closures
in West London, the potential for
a third runway at Heathrow, the
housing crisis and the demolition of
Shepherds Bush market.
The first campaign is particularly
relevant for Imperial students, in
more ways than one. The proposed
demolition of Charing Cross will
mean many students nearest hospital
becomes (St Mary’s in Paddington) or
Chelsea and Westminster, with only
the former having a full-blown A&E
department.
Any changes to Charing Cross
will likely also impact on medical
students, many of whom study in the
hospital throughout their clinical
years.
Chelsea and Fulham
Chelsea and Fulham is currently
represented by the Conservative
Party’s Greg Hands, the Deputy Chief
Whip of the Coalition government.
Hands was previously MP for
Hammersmith and Fulham from
2005-2010 and is running for a
second term (also his third overall) in
the 2015 election.
Current polling data suggests Hands
will be returned to the government
with a 60% share of the vote, with
the Labour candidate coming in
second with 25% of the vote. Despite
including wards from the Labour
Hammersmith and Fulham borough,
Chelsea and Fulham is a very safe seat
for the Conservatives.
Hands’ policies echo those of
the Conservative Party in general,
as he has endorsed the party’s
manifesto. Most of the key pledges
aren’t particularly relevant for
most students, as they focus on
earlier stages of education, pensions,
apprenticeships and changes to
Inheritance Tax and the higher rate
of Income Tax.
Other promises highlighted by
Hands include increased spending
on the NHS and lifting the cap on
university places.
Cities of London and
Westminster
Cities of London and Westminster
has been represented since 2001 by
the Conservative Party’s Mark Field.
Current polling shows Field will
likely be returned with 53% of the
vote, continuing the constituency’s
trend of returning the Conservative
candidate in every election since
its inception in 1950. Labour are
predicted to come second with 24% of
the vote.
Field has run campaigns on
multiple topics affecting constituents,
including funding of hospitals,
policing issues, housing problems,
as well as those affecting the city at
large, not least transport.
Kensington
Kensington was represented
until 2015 by Malcolm Rifkind of
the Conservative Party, who is not
seeking to retain his seat in the 2015
election.
The candidates standing in
Kensington from the major parties
are Dr Rodwan Abouharb (Labour),
Victoria Borwick (Conservative),
Robin McGhee (Liberal Democrats),
Jack Bovill (UKIP) and Robina Rose
(Green).
Current polls show Victoria
Borwick being elected for the
Conservatives with 51% of the vote,
with Labour on 19% and the Liberal
Democrats on 15%.
Felix spoke to each of the candidates
for Kensington, asking them why we
should vote for them and their party,
and their responses are printed below.
Dr Rodwan Abouharb (Labour)
told us “residents need an advocate
not only locally, but also nationally
in parliament making a strong case
for government to understand and
address the needs of all communities
living in Kensington.
When you head off to the polling
station on 7 May, your choice is
simple. Will you vote for the self-
interest of the few, or for the good of
the many of One Kensington?”
Victoria Borwick (Conservative)
said “I was born in this constituency
and spent my life here. Over the past
seven years on the Greater London
Authority and two years working as
Boris’s deputy, I have worked hard to
promote innovation and enterprise
in this great city. I’m passionate about
London and its residents.
If you vote for me, I and a
Conservative government would
fight to keep the economy on track,
continue to create jobs and secure a
bright future for young people living
in Kensington today.”
Robin McGhee,(Liberal Democrats)
said “the Liberal Democrats want
to do something about the housing
crisis. Housing is the most important
issue facing young people in London
today. We need urgent action now to
ensure our generation doesn’t get left
behind.”
Jack Bovill (UKIP) told us that “the
only reason to vote for me, the UKIP
Candidate in Kensington, is that I
care for open access to learning of
everyone in this land, particularly
where the learning is structured and
led by teachers of renown.” before
quoting George Orwell.
Robina Rose, Green did not submit
a response before Felix went to print.
