420: Thousands gather in
Hyde Park, more than 50
arrested
As pro-cannabis protesters openly
smoked the drug in Hyde Park on
April 20 (an annual global celebration
of cannabis, where calls for drug
law reform take place), police ended
up arresting 53 people. 16 were
taken into custody, whereas 21 were
released on bail and required to
return to the station at a later date.
Many participants distributed
cannabis leaf-shaped flyers and held
picket signs, with one notable one
reading “Ed Milliband wouldn’t
want his own children criminalised
for cannabis possession.” Dozens of
police officers and prominent police
signs saying “Possession of cannabis
is illegal” were also noted at the event,
with a Met Police Spokesman having
said that “anyone seen by an officer
openly smoking cannabis in Hyde
Park or in the Westminster area
could be issued with a warning or face
arrest.”
The 420 Day event was organised
by a reform-seeking group called
NORML UK, along with the UK
Cannabis Social Clubs (UKCSC).
Speaking to the Guardian last year,
Greg de Hoedt, president of UKCSC,
gave the following statement:
“The cannabis community is crying
out for legalization and regulation.
We encourage growers to register
with UKCSC because we want data
we can present to authorities and
say: this many people grow cannabis,
this many people are growing for
medicinal purposes; and we can also
establish which strains work with
which illnesses.”
Dyson School of Design
Engineering
Launched in late March by
Chancellor George Osborne and
industrial engineer Sir James Dyson,
the new Dyson School of Engineering
is the first new engineering
department set up at Imperial in
the last two decades. The School will
be housed at the former Post Office
Building on Exhibition Road
The School will offer three courses
next academic year: a 4-year MEng
in Design Engineering; and two
Masters programs, one in Global
Design Engineering and another in
Innovation Design Engineering (IDE).
The latter, with a 30-year history
formerly under the Department of
Mechanical Engineering, is being
jointly offered in collaboration with
the Royal College of Art.
October 2015 will see the School’s
first ever intake of students, where
the initial cohort will first use
Imperial’s existing facilities. By
October 2017, teaching is expected to
move to the new building: the former
Post Office Building on Exhibition
Road which was purchased by
Imperial from the Science Museum.
The new School was made possible
by a £12m donation from the James
Dyson Foundation, which is the
charity’s largest ever single gift. This
is not the first time the Dyson name
has been involved with Imperial
College London: Sir James Dyson is
a longstanding supporter of the IDE
Masters program, and in 2014, Dyson
Ltd announced a £5m investment in
a new robotics lab within Imperial.
Bye-bye ouchies: invisible
mending for the human body
Researchers at Imperial College
London have developed a novel way
to treat severe burns and assist in
organ transplants. The team, led by
Molly Stevens from the Institute
of Biomedical Engineering, have
designed sheets of silicon bandages
coated with nanoneedles for this
purpose.
The idea is that the healing
capacity of tissues can be boosted
by microscopically puncturing
thousands of cells at once, delivering
a shot of DNA with each puncture.
There are many proposed uses for the
resulting product; one major idea is to
prevent unsightly burn scars during
the healing process. At present,
patients have to wait until the healing
process is complete before treating
any discoloration and uneven
surfacing with plastic surgery, laser
resurfacing and/or medical tattooing.
One of the key reasons of treatment
by introducing DNA into cells is
to reprogram how they respond to
damage. However, inserting DNA
into cells can be tricky: injections
only allow for one cell to receive
new DNA at a time, whereas using
genetically engineered viruses
(perfect as they are nature’s experts at
hijacking cell DNA) cannot guarantee
that none of the virus’ genes will
contaminate the process - something
potentially lethal. The nanoneedle
silicon bandage, on the other hand,
will be safer and more efficient at
reprogramming whole tissues.
Big Brother really IS
watching you: better video
emotion/likeability tracking
software to be developed
Tech outfit Realeyes, in conjunction
with Imperial College London, have
received a €3.64m grant from the
European Commision for a project
to improve the former’s emotion-
tracking technology. Dubbed SEWA:

Carol Ann Cheah recaps some of the last month’s news stories
"...build
on a
worldwide
database
on how
‘likeability’
is linked to
emotional
reactions”
"..police
ended up
arresting
53 people,
16 were
taken into
custody... "
Automatic Sentiment Analysis in
the Wild, the research will be led by
Professor Maja Pantic from Imperial,
along with guidance from various
organizations’ experts including
AOL, Ipsos, Skype, and Kaplan.
Realeyes is known for its technology
that uses standard computer webcams
to measure subconscious responses
from audiences as they view video
content. Present-day facial coding
technology and emotion analytics,
including what Realeyes currently
offers to its clients, can measure
the six universal basic emotions
(anger, fear, disgust, happiness,
sadness and surprise), as well as
engagement. Realeyes however says
that ‘likeability’ is actually a complex
emotional state, which automated
emotion measurement technologies
cannot currently detect. It also
stresses how likeability is directly
linked to sales,
With names like Adobe, Google,
IKEA and Ford on its list of clients,
Realeyes boasts collaborations with
various Fortune 500 brands and a
variety of publishers. SEWA, which
will improve the current Realeyes
platform, will build on a worldwide
database of how ‘likeability’ is linked
to emotional reactions. Realeyes
says it has recorded the emotional
responses of over 60,000 people
in conjunction with answers to
a series of ‘likeability’ questions
relating to sharing content and
recommendations.
