But what
about the 3D?
As with almost every major
blockbuster being released these
days,Age of Ultron has been
released in both 3D and 2D.But
is the extra spend on the 3D
worth it?
Unless you’re heading to see
the film in IMAX,not really.The
3D does get some use,but it’s
nothing special and its presence
doesn’t really add to the film in
any noticeable way.
The visual are plenty
sumptuous enough without it.
"The film
embraces
Vision’s
weirdness
with
outright
glee."
"In place of
euphoria
comes
something
more
mature."
with the Infinity Stones doesn’t do a
huge amount beyond introduce them
(once more) as a concept, and vaguely
set up Ragnarok in the process (in its
defence, it does at least get closure of
sorts, so it’s not exactly an unresolved
plot-thread that doesn’t work in-film).
The various mentions of Wakanda
(the home of Black Panther) appear
in a scene that feels like it might
well have been cut if it didn’t need
to exist to set up those plot threads –
although since that scene then leads
to Ultron’s daddy issues outburst, it’s
a fairly good one to have kept in.
One of the main disappointments
from the film actually comes from
the absence of a future film set-up:
FX plates were shot for an appearance
by Captain Marvel in the film’s final
scene, but she was ultimately switched
out for another (unnamed here)
character.
All this talk of character beats and
emotions doesn’t mean that Age of
Ultron doesn’t still deliver on the
action. It does, it really does.
The special effects are second
to none, the action is (mostly)
wonderfully shot (it occasionally
gets a little choppy and confusing, a
complaint that never held for the first
film), and it makes great use of all the
characters.
There’s no standout moment –
nothing like “Hulk… smash” or Iron
Man’s adventure into the portal – but
there are plenty of cheer-worthy
segments (one hit in particular
triggered the audience I was with to
burst out into cheering and applause),
and it’s still a visual treat.
Whedon knows that what was
magical once won’t necessarily be
magical again, and he’s delivered a
different film that satisfies those
needs while also providing something
more.
It’s not as euphoric as Avengers,
but that may well have been asking
the impossible, and the unnecessary.
In place of the euphoria comes
something more mature and more
meaningful. Where there was once
only the fight, now there is a reason to
keep fighting.
You can’t ask for more than that.
