controversial composers
Boulez at 90: The Enfant
Terrible of Modern Music
P
ierre Boulez is the
controversial figure at
the forefront of musical
development in the 20th
Century. Though equally respected
by his enemies as by his supporters, a
certain stubbornness and radicalism
has alienated many. For instance,
in 1952 he declared in one fell
swoop half of the musical world as
useless, in 1967 that opera houses
should be blown up, and in 1971 he
advocated for the destruction of
the Mona Lisa. But read past these
shocking soundbites and you may
find yourself in fact following his
arguments. Indeed the vast literature
he has produced throughout his
career has swayed many, undoubtedly
influencing the course of music
history, and it certainly does display
a penetrating and unabashed
intelligence. Of course, his music is
the true testament to this: original,
endlessly thought provoking, and
constantly being reinvented; the
Guardian says “it is impossible to
imagine […] the entire musical world
without Pierre Boulez”. But then why
haven’t you heard of him? And, at the
recent 90th
birthday celebrations at
the Barbican, why was the hall half
empty?
The masterpieces of Mozart were
written at a time when men wore
powdered wigs and aristocrats
declared that “To write poetry after
Auschwitz is barbaric”. Whether
you agree or not, it is clear that art
could not continue as before and
ignore the new reality. In the 20th
Century an unprecedented diversity
of musical thought emerged, ranging
from the reactionary and easy-
going minimalists to the strictures
of serialism. Boulez, at least at the
start of his career, was a certified
serialist. Serialism was a method,
developed by Arnold Schoenberg in
the 1920s, which attempted to free
music from the “tyranny” of the tonal
centre, allowing the other musical
parameters, such as rhythm and
timbre to take centre-stage.
After the war, Boulez and others
would extend this beyond tone to
all the parameters of sound, a style
known as total serialism. This rigid,
highly formulised way of writing
music was attacked for its asceticism,
for its artifice and sterility, and
for its lack of expression. Boulez
himself realised these limits, but his
later music retains certain aspects,
including a focus on architecture and
structure rather than expression or
sensuality. This certainly sets him
apart from past French composers,
such as Debussy or Ravel, but then
again Boulez was working in a new
world. His musical mission seems
altogether higher, and in his own
words was nothing less than the
construction of a new ‘musical
language’.
“If you want a kind of supermarket
aesthetic, OK, do that, nobody will be
against it, but everybody will eventually
forget it”
His first great success was ‘Le
marteau sans maitre’, or, ‘The
hammer without a master’, first
performed in 1955. The orchestration
was new and cosmopolitan –
combining instruments from all
over the world into groups and
allowing an abstraction of timbre
from instrumental identities.
Although it is set to surrealist
poetry, the music is structured at
even the smallest scale according to
techniques derived from serialism
such as pitch multiplication. In the
decades since, Boulez has published
fewer than 20 works, but each are,
in the words of George Benjamin,
“singular statements, singular and
unique works”, something unique
and I think entirely appropriate for
our cultural milieu. Also unique is the
manner in which Boulez continually
revises his work and perfects them
further, as if reaching closer to some
ideal expression of the piece’s logic.
In these later works he experiments
with the use of chance to determine
structure (‘Pli selon pli’), spatial
organisation of sound (‘Rituel in
memoriam Bruno Maderna’) and the
use of electronics (such as in ‘Repons’).

entertained themselves at balls in
ornate palaces; the Enlightenment
ideals of rationality and form were
manifest. When Beethoven wrote his
dramatic symphonies, full of angst
and triumph, society was turning
inward and Napoleon’s conquests
inspired the ideas of great men. The
20th
Century began with two wars
of unprecedented scale. Industrial
technology enabled the destruction
of a generation, and entire peoples,
while in peacetime dehumanised the
lower classes and manufactured a
commodified culture for the masses.
At least, this is the pessimistic view
of social theorists such as Theodor
Adorno, who, in 1949, famously
