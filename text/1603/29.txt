away in Chile’s Colchagua Valley
South America, Chile, wine. That
simple little search linked me up
with Familia Espino in the heart
of Colchagua Valley, the nation’s
famed wine region that’s rapidly
gaining traction on both the gringo
trail and luxury travel market, while
still retaining the charm of a place
well within its prime. In the run-up to
my stay, I’d partied my way through
Rio Carnival, CouchSurfed with
some crazies across Argentina, and
burnt what remained of my energy
and sanity at Lollapalooza Festival –
decompression was long overdue.
The job appealed to me because I
wanted a combination of vineyard
work and care work, which is exactly
what the job delivered. The family
home is on the fringe of Marchigue, a
beautiful town set against a backdrop
of picturesque mountaintops and
endless vineyards, and the home itself
comes equipped with a well-groomed
Carmanere vineyard at its rear. Any
work on the vineyard will of course
vary depending on the time of year,
culminating in the late April harvest,
at which point grapes are shipped
off for processing and bottling.
Following an unfortunate accident
the family’s son Mario now relies on a
wheelchair for much of his mobility:
he receives around-the-clock care and
sessions with medical professionals,
so the role is predominately social,
with as many elements of physiothe
rapy as you’re willing to engage with.
I spent a month with Familia
Espino and had a fantastic time. In
addition to my work on the vineyard
and with Mario, my stay coincided
with the area’s largest wine harvest
festival, an excellent weekend of
outstanding food and wonderful
wines. The house is also a short bus
ride from capital Santiago, so it’s
perfectly doable to spend a couple
of weekends away partying with
whoever you happen to have met
on your travels. And for the wave
worshippers among you, Chilean surf
haven Pichilemu is just a short drive
away: the family have a car you can
borrow (a UK license will suffice) and
friends that can hook you up with
equipment. Oh, and the local produce
markets make Borough Market look
like Morrisons markdowns.
I’d say I picked up a lot more than
what I’d initially expected from the
job description: on top of learning
a thing or two about wine and
finding new friends in my hosts, I
was continuously kept on my toes at
mealtimes, due to the rapid pace of
Chilean Spanish and varied topics of
conversation.
On that note, I’d say this
WorkAway is a particularly good
call for anyone wanting longer-term
experience with a single patient,
those applying for graduate-entry
medicine, or someone simply looking
for a slight change of pace and
decompression from big city life. For
me the experience was a wonderful
WorkAway debut that I’d love to
replicate and would recommend to
anyone.
