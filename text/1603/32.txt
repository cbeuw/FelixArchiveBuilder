It’s time for the final entry in Marvel’s ‘Phase
Two’, as the Avengers come together once more
to face their greatest foe
The Age of Ultron is upon us
There’s a lot to be said about
sequels and their relationships
to their predecessors, and it’s
almost all been said before. So with
the usual preamble resoundingly
skipped, the heart of the matter is
this: Age of Ultron very much shares
the traditional trait of being a ‘darker’
sequel. It sheds the bombast and
excitement of the first Avengers
film for something more intense,
more personal, and ultimately more
fulfilling.
The first film was very slow-burn,
taking its time to piece the team
together – often by pitting the
various Avengers against each other
first – before everything comes
together in a triumphant climactic
battle in the middle of New York.
Age of Ultron gets all of that
business out of the way immediately,
opening in medias res with the
Avengers’ assault on Baron von
Strucker’s mountainous fortress (last
seen in the post-credits stinger for The
Winter Soldier).
Within the first few minutes,
there’s a new twist on that shot from
the last film, as well as a chance to
see all of the Avengers in action
– including the new additions to
the equation, Quicksilver (Aaron
Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch
(Elisabeth Olsen), although they’re
not called that here. Not yet. This
early on, they’re still Pietr and
Wanda Maximoff – and they’re on
the opposite side to the Avengers.
Any fears that this version of
Quicksilver wouldn’t match up to the
one seen in last year’s X-Men: Days of
Future Past can be laid to rest; while he
doesn’t quite have any one moment
that matches up to his X-Men

counterpart’s starring moment, this
Quicksilver has a more prolonged role
in the storyline to compensate.
Naturally this first battle is won
by the Avengers – although the
Maximoffs are still at large – and it
appears that Hydra may have finally
been put to rest, and the team can
relax in style.
At the party, Whedon’s typical
quick-witted interplay comes to the
fore, providing a stream of laughs
while also showing that these are
all characters he understands. A
contest to try and lift Thor’s hammer
quickly lays out the traits of the group
alongside a healthy dose of comedy.
And then Ultron (played
magnificently by James Spader)
arrives to ruin it all.
Ultron is a fascinating villain.
Despite the film’s hefty running time,
and his presence in most of it, he still
feels weirdly under-used.
Created by Tony Stark (Robert
Downey, Jr.) in an attempt to craft
a global peace-keeping program, he
definitely has some daddy issues
alongside his need to see the human
race driven to extinction for its own
good.
His reasoning behind this – and
therefore his entire motivation for
doing anything in the film – doesn’t
feel as fully explored or fleshed out
as it could be. It just sort of ‘is.’ It’s
acknowledged a lot, but not really
discussed.
The daddy issues only really get one
moment of being dealt with – and it’s
a glorious one that reveals volumes
about Ultron as a character, which is
why it’s a shame there aren’t more of
them.
But there’s always an underlying
tension to the whole thing, with
Ultron very much being his father’s
creation: even his speech rhythms
subconsciously echo Stark’s, making
for some entertaining subversion of
standard villain tropes.
But while the father-son dynamic
of Stark and Ultron doesn’t fully get
its due, the relationships between
other characters are almost all given
a chance to shine. Vision in particular
gets his own father-son storyline with
Ultron – one which has a great deal
more resolution than Ultron and
Stark’s – and it’s one that lands with
genuine meaning.
More generally, where Avengers had
to do a lot of leg work in just getting
everyone together, Age of Ultron
starts off with pretty much everyone
involved (at least early on) being a
known quantity.
With that, it has plenty of room to
go off and explore the bonds between
characters, and toy with just how they
bounce off one another.
The connection between Black
Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce
Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)
seems to have only grown since the
first film – not something anyone
really seems to have seen coming
– while the ideological conflicts
between Captain America (Chris
Evans) and Iron Man start to simmer
nicely before Civil War.
Age of Ultron is a hugely character-
driven piece, much more so than
its predecessor (and arguably the
other Marvel films). It’s to Whedon’s
enormous credit that it never loses
any entertainment value for that, and
it feels like a much richer film for it.
Avengers occasionally stumbled
in its handling of characters, often
feeling like the Tony Stark Show, to
the detriment of smaller characters
like Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), which
is probably why it’s such a joy here
that Hawkeye is the absolute heart of
Age of Ultron.
It’s hard to put into words just how
much Hawkeye matters to this film.
Almost all of the humanity either
comes from or is directly related to
him, and it gives the film the vast
majority of its emotional beats.
Discussions on how mere mortals
like Hawkeye are working alongside
these gods (literally, in one case)
to become something genuinely
heroic, simply because it’s their day
job. Inspiring speeches on duty and
sacrifice. Musings on family, and
what being an Avenger means for
that. It all stems from Hawkeye. And
it is wonderful.
The only thing that stops him from
stealing the entire show is The Vision
(Paul Bettany). The Vision is an
absolute picture – he looks deliriously
weird, and it feels like he marks the
point where the Marvel Cinematic
Universe finally tips over into the
kooky, magical space drama side of
things.
Guardians of the Galaxy was the first
film to really embrace that non-
Earth-bound side of the universe,
and it was a resounding success, so
it’s not exactly an original claim,
but the arrival of Vision heralds the
dawn of Phase 3. You can feel the
shift happening around him, as the
dark, broody Phase 2 gives way to the
gloriously insane, enormous in scale
Phase 3.
The film embraces Vision’s
weirdness with outright glee, and
he’s easily the best addition to the
franchise from this film.
That shift between MCU
Phases doesn’t come without its
simultaneous upsides and downsides,
however.
There are multiple references to
future storylines that feel more than a
little shoe-horned in: Thor’s side-plot
