Elections in the
UK: A guide for
dummies
What is a general election?
Every 5 years, residents of the UK are able to vote
on candidates to represent them in the House of
Commons. The UK is split into areas of roughly
equal population size, called constituencies. Each
constituency will have several MP candidates standing
for election, with candidates often being affiliated with
a main political party. Those that are not are called
“Independent” candidates.
What are the main political parties in the
UK?
Three parties usually dominate the House of Commons,
which are the Conservative party, the Labour party and
the Liberal Democrats. However, many other parties
may secure a small number of seats, including the
Green Party, or the United Kingdom Independence
Party (UKIP). Each party has various political views and
stances, which their MP candidates will generally also
be in favour of.
How many MPs are there?
There is one per constituency, and there are 650
constituencies across the whole of the UK.
In London due to the high population density,
there are 73 different constituencies, but generally
cities have far fewer. The whole of Wales only has 40
constituencies for example, whilst Scotland has 59.
There are around 50,000 to 70,000 people in each
constituency.
Who can be an MP?
Anyone can stand as a Member of Parliament; they
simply need to be a British or Irish Commonwealth
citizen, and over 18. They cannot be a public official or
officeholder.
Who decides who is Prime Minister?
You cannot vote on who is Prime Minister, as they
are, by convention, appointed by the Monarch. The
individual who is considered “to command the
confidence of the House of Commons” and therefore
the usually the leader of the majority political party or,
if there is a coalition, the leader of the party that holds
the most seats will be Prime Minister.
What voting system does the general
election use?
The current system is called “First Past the Post” (FPTP).
This means you can only cast one vote for an MP
candidate, and the candidate that receives the most
vote wins that seat and represents that constituency in
the House of Commons.
How does a party form the government?
Each MP has a seat in the House of Commons, and the
party that wins the most seats forms the government.
This means that they can put their ideas and views into
practise when running the country.
A party needs to command more than half the
seats to win, and the party that wins the second
largest seats becomes the “opposition” party. If a party
doesn’t command a majority of the seats, coalition
governments may form. Parties come together until
they represent the majority of seats.
For the last General Election
in 2010, Felix ran a similar
poll and found that 56% of
those who responded intended to
vote Liberal Democrats, 24% were
going to vote for a Conservative
Party candidate and only 16% were
planning on casting their vote for a
Labour Party candidate.
Despite this, the overwhelming
majority of students still predicted
that there would be Conservative win
or hung parliament, which was, as we
now know, the outcome of the 2010
General Election.
With Nick Clegg promising back in
2010 to scrap tuition fees, this may
be how his party garnered so much
student support, although they also
seemed to be pessimistic about if
he would ever actually take power.
Back then, the Liberal Democrat
manifesto also had a visibly larger
portion dedicated around
science policies,
and had also
pledged not to
cut the science
budget if they
made it into
power.
Interestingly,
a YouGov poll at
the time found
that 49% of all
voters would have
actually voted for a
Liberal Democrat, if
they thought the party
actually had a shot at
winning and taking some
of those safe seats from
Labour or Conservative
candidates.
35%of students
will be
voting for
the Conservative party this year,
although a further 30% will be giving
the Labour party their vote, our Felix
opinion poll shows.
Only 18% of students are voting for
the liberal democrats, a significant
drop in numbers since the last general
election poll that took place in 2010,
when 56% said they would cast their
vote for Nick Clegg and his crew. 9%
of students said they would vote for
the Green Party, whilst 5% said they
would be giving Farage the seal of
approval and voting for UKIP.
We asked a total of 189 students
how likely they will be voting next
Thursday in the General Elections;
incredibly, 80% of students who
responded said they were very likely
to vote, with only 6% of respondents
saying that they probably wouldn’t
bother.
When we asked students to list what
topics mattered most to them, 34%
of respondents said the Economy was
their primary concern, and a further
17% said they were most interested in
healthcare. 9% of respondents listed
Education as the top topic that they
were most interested in.
Not surprisingly, none of the
respondents listed pensions, local
government or rural affairs as topics
they were most concerned about,
although encouragingly 8% did list
the environment as something they
were most interested in.
Compared with other universities,
it seems Imperial has mirrored
national student statistics. In a
survey questioning more than
13,000 students nationwide, Labour
and Conservative parties came up
as equally popular, with 31% of the
vote each. St Andrews students are
most likely to vote for Conservative
candidates, whilst the Green Party
has amassed a strong support with
Edinburgh University students.
Compared to national predictions

from electionforcast.co.uk, at the time
of print, there are similar trends
between the two datasets, although it
should be noted that the number of
individuals voting for a party does
not reflect the percentage of seats
MPs will obtain in Parliament.
Conservative are expected to win
279 out of the 650 seats available,
with Labour coming up close with
270. Liberal Democrats are looking at
securing 27 seats, with UKIP and the
Green Party winning 2 and just one
seat respectively.
