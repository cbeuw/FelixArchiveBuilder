Philippa Skett reports on the latest finding from the MRC
Weeks to remain closed despite student protests
The most recent findings
from the Medical Research
Council (MRC) Centre for
Outbreak Analysis & Modelling has
predicted an extra 3.5 million cases
of malaria as a result of the epidemic.
Researchers based at the Centre have
also found that the disease hits those
under one year of age hardest, with
90% of those infected dying shortly
after.
Results from models developed by
one research team have found that
the Ebola epidemic has also resulted
into an additional 3.5 million cases
and an additional 10,900 extra deaths
from malaria.
Countries hit by Ebola, including
New Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia
saw major disruption or closure of
their healthcare facilities as a result of
the outbreak.
Due to the nature of Ebola and its
transmission, isolating those infected
and ensuring the safety of the
healthcare workers has overwhelmed
and disrupted healthcare provisions
across the three countries, having
a knock-on effect on treating those
with other ailments.
The researchers then modelled the
effect removal of healthcare would
have on these numbers. They used
demographic and health survey data
from 2000 up until the first Ebola
outbreak in March 2014.
They found that without any
medical care whatsoever, the number
of cases of malaria rise by 45% in
Guinea, 88% in Sierra Leone, and an
incredible 140% in Liberia. This is
equivalent to 3.5 million cases of the
disease, and a further 10,000 malaria-
attributable deaths. Half of these
cases would affect children under five
years of age.
However, the researchers also found
that mass drug administration and
distributing more insecticide-treated
mosquito nets could mitigate the
effect somewhat.
“The on-going Ebola epidemic in
parts of west Africa… [is] threatening
to jeopardise progress made in
malaria control and elimination over
the past decade,” said lead author Dr
Patrick Walker.
“In heavily affected Ebola areas
the indirect impact of Ebola upon
malaria deaths is likely to be of a
similar magnitude to the public
health burden caused by cases of
Ebola directly.”
Another research group based
at the MRC Centre for Outbreak
Analysis & Modelling, collaborated
with the World Health Organisation,
alongside researchers from the
University of Toronto and the
University of British Columbia to
address the demographics the disease
is hitting hardest.
The group of researchers found that
the disease progresses more quickly
and is more likely to be fatal for
children under five. 90% of children
under the age of one fall fatal to the
disease too, compared to 80% of those
infected that are aged one to four.
Nearly 4,000 children under sixteen
have suffered from the disease since
the epidemic began over a year ago,
and the proportion of those effected
by Ebola who are children is also
increasing over time.
Their research found that children
infected with Ebola have a shorter
incubation period then adults,
with those under one year of age
on average harbouring the virus
for 6.9 days before presenting with
symptoms.
Not only that, but the researchers
found that symptoms are generally
different for those of different ages.
Younger children are less likely to
present with abdominal, joint or
muscle pain, but are more likely to
have a fever.
Professor Christl Donnelly, a
co-author of the study, said: “These
Weeks hall is to remain
closed for the next
academic year despite
students petitioning to save the space,
and the student Union Council voting
to campaign against the closure.
The Imperial College Union
President, Tom Wheeler, announced
in his report to council detailing his
recent activity that he was unable
to overturn the decision to close the
hall, after contacting Muir Sanderson,
The Chief Financial Officer of the
college. Wheeler was told that the
Provost board has already made the
decision, and they were not prepared
to overturn their decision.
This follows the furore last term
when, back in February, council
initially voted to allow the closure of
the Weeks hall, after being told the
space could be used for childcare to
make the university more attractive
to female academics.
However the first vote resulted
in equal number of students being
either for or against campaigning to
save the hall. A second vote ran saw
the council narrowly deciding not to
campaign against the closure.
Weeks hall committee members
were left outraged at the decision,
especially since they were not
consulted before the announcement
to close the hall reached Council.
Recruitment for hall seniors was
already underway at the time, as
the residents were all under the
assumption the hall would still be in
use for the next academic year.
Neither Imperial College Union
or College have yet to accept
responsibility for not informing the
residents of the hall of the closure.
The hall committee then arranged
a petition to call for an emergency
council meeting in March, and
residents of the halls turned up in
large numbers to argue the benefits of
keeping the hall open. Union Council
then voted again, this time in favour
of campaigning against the closure.
Chris Kaye, Deputy President
(Welfare) is also liaising with the
director of Human Resources,
Louise Lindsey, to ensure there will
be maximised space available for
childcare provision with the Weeks
building.
Property in the North of Princes
Gardens will also be used for various
purposes, which will be primarily
‘academic’ related, although no
specifics have been released as to what

findings show that Ebola affects
young children quite differently to
adults, and it’s especially important
that we get them into treatment
quickly.
“We also need to look at whether
young children are getting treatment
that’s appropriate for their age.”
The MRC Centre for Outbreak
Analysis and Modelling is based at
Imperial’s St Mary’s Campus, in West
London.
Founded in 2007, the Centre aims
to research disease spread to better
prepare for and shape responses to
epidemics.
Those working at the Centre are
currently analysing and modelling
the spread of diseases such as SARS,
avian flu, swine flu, alongside Ebola
and malaria.
this would entail yet.
Wheeler also noted in his report
that Pembridge hall will remain open
for a further three years, although
its derelict annex at the top of the
building and the surrounding garden
will be converted into houses, that
will then be sold to fund other college
ventures.
An Imperial spokesperson told
Felix: The internal structure and
listed status of the building means
it would be difficult to refurbish
it as a hall of residence to bring it
in line with the standards of other
accommodation. These structural
issues mean there is little scope for
expansion in bed spaces, rendering
the refurbishment cost per bed space
prohibitive.
“Imperial is currently exploring
other options for the future use of the
site.”
