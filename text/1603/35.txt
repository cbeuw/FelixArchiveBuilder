This week you share an
article about politics from
the Guardian on Facebook,
instantly making you an
expert on politics. Tom
Wheeler hands over his
presidency to you, you’re
offered a job at the Guardian,
and you win a Pulitzer and a
Nobel peace prize. You then
wake up from your wet dream.

This week in the midst of a
revision slump, you check your
Facebook and realize that all
your friends from home have
all finished university already,
while you still have several
weeks until the end of exams.
At least we’re getting fresh
pizza bases next year.
This week you decide to go to
the protest against the beach
body ready advert in Hyde
Park, to show everyone that
you should love your body
and not be concerned about
whether or not you fit in.
Unfortunately everyone is
repulsed by you in beach wear
and you’re asked to leave.
After spending 4/20 blazing
it up in Hyde Park, you made
friends with a friendly drug
dealer who you, whilst quite
high, gave your number.
Unfortunately they keep
sending you nudes and upon
closer inspection, it was
actually just the Felix Editor.
This week you realize that you
have left your accommodation
for next year too late, and all
your friends have already
found people to live with.
You then live in the library
next term; however you
unfortunately realize that
at night Alice Gast patrols
the library, consuming any
sleeping Chinese students.
This week you realize that due
to the shorter final term, you
have money left over in your
student loan, which you decide
to spend on a sex doll of Nigel
Farage.
Unfortunately your Erasmus
friend spots you in the act,
and has subsequently fled the
country.
At least you have Nigel.
This week you go to see
Imperial’s University
Challenge team compete,
hoping to meet sex symbol
Jeremy Paxman. At the after
party you get talking and one
thing leads to another and you
find out you’re carrying his
baby.
Perhaps this child can fill that
empty space in your life?
This week you have an
anatomy lecture. However, you
forget to actually register what
it’s specifically about, so on
your second day after Easter
break you are subjected to a
tirade of images of dissected
genitalia.
You also realize this is the first
time you’ve seen any genitals
since freshers week.
This week you decide to join in
on the Milifandom on twitter
and get to making friends with
a politically conscious 17 year
old who subsequently invites
you on a date to their house.
When you arrive you find out
it was actually a truck driver
from Leeds called Barry who
forces you to eat Doritos off
his dog.
This week in an attempt to
cram as much as possible for
your exam, you drink a litre
of Red Bull; however this has
serious psychoactive effects,
causing you to revise for 48
hours in a row.
When you review your notes
the day after, you realize you
had just written Chris Kaye’s
name 10122 times.
This week you discover
that Masters degree you
received still isn’t worth a
lot so you have to find some
extra money. After much
desperation you find a grant
for married Greek women, and
marry a waiter called Savas so
you can afford it- he does have
a penchant for anal, but you
can’t have everything.
This week after Tom Wheeler
gets Dib Dabs in the shop, you
decide to get one. Flooded with
nostalgia you buy 50 of them;
however after having two you
realize sherbet isn’t that great
and you have wasted your
money.
This isn’t a joke, I just feel
I need to share my poor
decisions with the readers.
NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS

Staff Briefings
Hangman “too meta for its
own good”
News in Brief: UK set to elect man in 2015 General
Election
Using some of the most
complex algorithms known
to man, our staff at Hangman
have managed to decode the puzzle
for who would be headlining the
Imperial summer ball, eventually
discovering that the answer was
“Green”.
Hangman then proceeded to dig up
Alan Turing’s body and reanimate it.
Once he had regained consciousness,
Hangman forced him to help us work
out that this clue was referring to the
fact that the main act would in fact be
Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green
Party.
After Alan had done that we then
coerced him into hacking into the
Green party’s email system, which
took no time at all due to their
password being “I <3 trees”.
From this, Hangman can now
exclusively reveal the content of
Bennett’s act.
From what we’ve been able
to decode from their illiterate
ramblings, there will be a live
compost act to start off with, followed
by her showing the audience how
to reuse your old tea bags to make a
deckchair.
There is then the promise of some
of Bennett’s hot tracks from her
as-yet unreleased mixtape which is
set to debut if they ever win any seats
outside of Brighton, so it’s very likely
this will be a one off performance.
This mixtape contains such hits as
“No plans for where the money for
our policies will come from”, and
“We’ll ban animal testing, regardless
of the help they provide for modern
medicine”.
Hangman also found blueprints
for a mobile solar panel that would
“create energy from how on fire
Bennet’s mixtape would be”, filling
us with a lot of optimism for June the
something-th, and we’re sure that all
seven people that have bought tickets
will enjoy the display.
For many this will be a
controversial choice as in the recent
Hangman election survey, nobody
said they would fuck or marry Natalie
Bennett.
The “fuck, marry, avoid” survey was
answered by 749 Imperial students
(more than the Felix General Election
exit poll, Hangman is obliged to point
out).
In fact, we can now reveal that
56% of imperial students would fuck
David Cameron, with many citing
their wish to hate fuck them as their
motivation.
One student said that they would
marry Ed Miliband due to the fact
his deep brown eyes filled them with
not only a heavy sense of security, but
also an uncontrollable urge to fuck
him right in the arse with a kiwi fruit.
Nick Clegg received an incredibly
large number of avoid votes, which
when Hangman contacted him for
his opinion, replied that he was
“extremely disappointed”, and said
that “he would be more committed
this time”.
Hangman now does not reply to his
calls anymore and has blocked him on
Facebook.
Unfortunately the amount of nudes
we’re currently getting sent is slowing
down our servers and we might have
to take out a restraining order in
order to get this issue out on time.
