Everything you need to know to cast your vote
The General Election 2015
The main parties and their promises
Philip Kent scrutinises the pledges each party has made ahead of the election
CONSERVATIVE
Economy
The Conservatives pledge to
simultaneously eliminate the
UK’s budget deficit while granting
millions a tax cut, in raising the
minimum salary upon which you
pay income tax to £12,500.
They also pledge to not rise VAT,
national insurance, or income
tax; and will introduce a law to
bind themselves to doing it. They
intend to pay for this through
cutting down on tax evasion
and avoidance, further austerity,
and putting measures in place
to promote growth in the North,
Midlands, South West and East
England, partially through
devolution to elected mayors.
Healthcare
The Tories’ headline pledge in
healthcare is to provide 7 day
access to GPs by 2020, but they
have also pledged to fund in full
the request of £8 billion by NHS
England. Further therapists
for those with mental health
conditions will be introduced, and
health and social care systems will
be joined up using a £5.3 billion
fund.
Education
Announced as part of a previous
Budget, a postgraduate loan
system will be introduced for
taught masters and PhD courses.
The Conservatives will also lift
the cap on university places,
create enterprise zones around
universities to promote spinouts,
and invest more money in online
education.
Welfare
Much debate has been had in the
press over where the Conservatives
will cut £12 billion from the
welfare budget. They intend to
do this in part through freezing
working age benefits, excluding
disability benefits, for the first two
years of the Parliament.
In addition, the benefit cap will be
reduced by £3,000 to £23,000 but
disability living allowance and the
personal independence payment
will continue to be exempt.
LABOUR
Economy
The front page of Labour’s
manifesto pledges to obtain a
surplus on the current budget
as soon as possible. This differs
from the Conservatives’ policy,
as they pledge to eliminate the
entire deficit, while Labour’s
pledge still allows them to borrow
for infrastructure investment
– capital projects. Labour also
pledges not to increase personal
taxes, but will reintroduce the
50p tax rate, and abolish the “non
dom” status which allows some
people to not pay UK tax on their
earnings outside the UK. The
minimum wage will be increased
to more than £8 an hour by late
2019, and zero-hours contracts
will be banned. A mansion tax will
also be introduced.
Healthcare
Labour have not pledged the full
£8 billion requested by Simon
Stevens, head of NHS England,
however they have pledged £2.5
billion to pay for more GPs,
nurses, and midwives, as well
as look to provide the money if
they can make it available. They
also pledge to put mental health
on the same priority as physical
health, repeal the Health and
Social Care Act, cap profits made
by private operators in the NHS,
and guarantee GP appointments
within 48 hours.
Education
Tuition fees will be cut to £6,000
for home and EU students, and
provide more in-depth careers
advice for school students to help
them decide between university
and apprenticeships.
Welfare
Labour will abolish the Bedroom
Tax, also known as the Spare
Room Subsidy, and impose rules
where migrants cannot claim
UK benefits until they have been
resident for at least two years.
Everyone over 25 out of work
for at least two years will be
guaranteed a job, which must be
taken (those under 25 will wait
only one year).
rolled out.
LIB DEMS
Economy
The Lib Dems will continue to
balance the country’s current
budget, like Labour allowing
borrowing for investment. They
will do this by April 2018. In
addition, an extra tax charge will
be levied on banks to raise money
to clear the deficit (after which it
will be removed). A mansion tax
will be introduced on properties
worth over £2 million, the
amount of money you can earn
before income tax raised to at least
£12,500, and additional work to
cut down on tax avoidance.
Healthcare
The Lib Dems will provide the
£8 billion requested by NHS
England, and will also provide
money for the rest of the United
Kingdom. £500 million will be
provided for mental health care,
with an aim to get waiting times
down to 6 weeks for depression
or anxiety, and 2 weeks for a first
episode of psychosis. GP surgeries
will be open in evenings and
weekends, with phone and Skype
appointments also made available.
A “Patient Premium” will be
introduced in disadvantaged areas.
Education
Higher education finance reforms
will be reviewed and changed
where needed, with a focus on
living costs. The review will also
cover postgraduate courses. The
Lib Dems will also look into
creation of a student contract, and
will aim to widen participation
through summer schools,
mentoring, and transparency in
selection criteria.
Welfare
Universal Credit will be
introduced, and the minimum
wage increased at a rate which
does not slow down job creation.
The Work Programme will be
reformed – the Lib Dems claim it
currently ignores people who have
not found work but stop claiming
jobseeker’s allowance.
GREEN
Economy
The Green Party reject austerity,
will renationalise the railways, and
will borrow to invest. Zero hours
contracts will be banned, and the
minimum wage increased to £10
an hour by 2020. The working
week will be set to a maximum
of 35 hours. A 60p tax rate will
be introduced at £150,000, and
people worth £3m or more will
be subject to a wealth tax of 2%.
Finally, a financial transaction tax
will be introduced.
Healthcare
The Greens have trumped the
other parties and have pledged to
increase the NHS budget by £12
billion. Social care will be, in some
cases, free of charge, and resources
will be provided to make mental
health a much high priority. The
Health and Social Care Act will be
repealed, and the Private Finance
Initiative method of building new
NHS buildings (where the private
sector builds the building and
leases it back to the NHS).
Education
Tuition fees will be scrapped
and debt cancelled for all
undergraduate courses, with grants
reintroduced. The Greens will
also consider scrapping tuition
fees for postgraduate courses.
State funding will be reintroduced
for all courses, and fossil fuel
divestment will be encouraged
across all universities.
Welfare
The Basic Income – a fixed income
paid to every individual – will
be consulted upon. In the mean
time, the Green Party will end
workfare (where people work for
benefits) and the bedroom tax. In
addition, half a million new social
rented homes will be introduced
by 2020. The carers allowance will
be increased by 50%, and child
benefit doubled.
UKIP
Economy
The amount of money you can
claim before paying income tax
will be increased to £13,000, and
inheritance tax will be abolished.
In addition, UKIP will introduce
a 30p tax rate starting somewhere
in between £43,500 and £55,000.
UKIP have also pledged to change
how VAT works upon withdrawal
from the EU, including removal
of VAT from sanitary products,
and will introduce rules to
ensure companies cannot avoid
corporation tax in the UK. The
Barnett Formula which allocates
funding in Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland will be replaced,
and the deficit eliminated.
Healthcare
UKIP will fund 8,000 more GPs,
20,000 more nurses and 3,000
more midwives. They will also
increase mental health funding
by £170 million, to improve
provision of mental health
services, and will trial a scheme
of putting GPs in A&E so those
with actual emergencies see an
emergency doctor.
Education
Tuition fees will be waived for
students studying STEM subjects
and medicine who remain in
their discipline in the UK for at
least 5 years. The target aiming
to get 50% of school leavers into
university will be abolished,
and EU students will not receive
tuition fee loans.
Welfare
UKIP will remove the bedroom
tax and will end the current
Work Capability Assessments for
disability benefits and move the
tests to GPs and consultants. The
carers allowance will be increased,
and will train and fund advisors
in food banks to help those who
use them, and exempt food banks
from many taxes. Migrants will be
banned from accessing benefits for
5 years, and the benefits cap will
be lowered.
