Lauren Ratcliffe on the impact of logging in Borneo’s rainforests
‘Kings’ of the Jungle De-Throned!
New research in Borneo by
researchers from Imperial
College London suggests
that clear cutting rainforests
changes which types of species
perform vital ecosystem functions.
In logged forests, vertebrates
instead of invertebrates appear to be
contributing a greater amount to key
processes such as seed dispersal and
predation. This switch in functional
dominance renders these systems
more vulnerable to future change.
Whether you be trekking through a
tropical forest or taking your dog out
for a walk, snorkelling with tortoises
or dipping your toes in Cornish
waters, in any terrestrial, marine or
aquatic environment, vertebrates
may catch your eye but most of the
time you are the visitor of a primarily
invertebrate world. Edward O. Wilson
has called them “the little things that
run the world,” and invertebrates
truly are the movers and shakers
of tropical ecosystems, vastly
outweighing their more charismatic
vertebrate companions in abundance
and diversity. One could even call
them the true kings of the jungle.
These little critters are the
foundations of life across many
ecosystems but their importance
is most prominent in tropical
rainforests. If left untouched by
mankind’s chainsaw and caterpillar
tractor, beetles and termites, ants
and earthworms can go about their
business with relative ease and help
decompose decaying matter like
fallen leaves. Through digestion
and egestion, the release of essential
nutrients such as nitrates and
phosphorous helps fuel the growth of
the surrounding fauna. Seeds off trees
are carried, munched and dispersed
across the forest floor by these little
creatures, which helps maintain
the vast diversity of tree species.
And carnivorous ants and spiders
can scuttle about, preying on these
insatiable herbivorous invertebrates,
thus keeping them in check so they
don’t much through all the foliage,
dead or alive.
Unfortunately, as a consequence
of globalisation and the growing
demand from an expanding human
population, intense legal and illegal
logging currently threatens half
of the world’s rainforests. The
caterpillar tractors are fired up
and chainsaws roar. In particular,
the clearing of land for palm
oil and timber plantations has
rendered Borneo’s rainforest
almost unrecognisable, with an area
almost the size of Belgium having
been cut down between 1985 and
2001 to supply the global timber
gluttony. As a consequence of this,
these little “movers and shakers” of
forest ecosystems have been severely
hit, with many species being lost
altogether.
So with these integral cogs
gone, what happens to the overall
functioning of tropical rainforests?
Well, surprisingly very little. In fact,
new research from Imperial College
London’s Department of Life Sciences
has indicated that tropical rainforests
are actually very resilient to change.
What does change, however, are
the type of creatures that perform
these vital functions. By excluding
either invertebrates or vertebrates
from patches of both logged and
unlogged rainforest in Borneo, the
researchers were table to determine
their contribution to three ecosystem
functions: leaf litter decomposition,
leaf-eating invertebrate predation
and seed disturbance. The team found
that in logged forests, vertebrates
played a more dominant functional
role and increased in abundance
compared to primary (untouched)
forest patches.
“Invertebrates are often thought of
as the controllers of tropical forests,
so it’s surprising that mankind
can upset their dominance to this
level,” said Dr Robert Ewers, lead
author of the study. For example, in
pristine primary forests predation
on herbivorous invertebrates is
almost entirely performed by other
invertebrates. However, in logged
forests their contribution to this
function is cut by 40% and animals
such as mice and tree shrews pick up
the slack.
Similar trends were seen for seed
disturbance rates. However, leaf
litter decomposition rates were
unaffected by lack of invertebrates
and it was not a function taken
up by the vertebrates. Instead the
team hypothesise that in the altered
microclimate in logged forests
leading to reduced humidity and
increased air temperature as well
as altered activities of soil bacteria
could have helped decomposition to
continue.
Although the ecosystem
can continue to function with
vertebrates usurping the throne from
invertebrates, the rainforests are
left more vulnerable to disturbance
than before. “The forest will keep
maintaining itself, but it will be much
more susceptible to further change.
Relying on vertebrates is a bad tactic,”
Dr Ewers elucidates. “Knocking out
one or two invertebrates might not
be too bad, as there are many others
to take their place, but knocking out
one or two vertebrates could now be
disastrous.”
Intrinsic susceptibility of
vertebrates to a range of human
pressures has seen their threat
status steadily rise over the last two
decades. Increased reliance on them
is therefore likely to render these
systems more vulnerable to future
disturbances. Invertebrates still
remain an important actor in logged
forests, but as the area of pristine
forest shrinks to less than a third
of the world’s forest area, their role
seems to have switched from true
kings of the jungle to jesters of the
crown court.
