Joshua Renken recaps the televised
election debate, and gives the lowdown
on how each candidate held their own
The big Debate between
the biggest names in
politics
The first and only televised
election debate for this year’s
general election took place
earlier this month, featuring seven
party leaders from across the United
Kingdom. The two-hour debate was
structured around four key questions
on the following topics: tackling
the deficit, the future of the NHS,
immigration policy and future
prospects for young people.
The marathon debate, moderated
by Julie Etchingham and hosted by
itv, represented months of foreplay
between political operators and
broadcasters culminating in a single
pre-election debate featuring seven
party leaders from across the political
spectrum.
The meeting was enlivened by the
new female dynamic and stirred by
the presence of three parties that
only stand in certain areas of the UK:
the SNP in Scotland, Plaid Cymru
in Wales and The Green Party in
England and Wales. So how well did
each candidate perform?
David Cameron-
Conservatives
Cameron took the opportunity to
reemphasise that five years ago the
country was “on the brink” and that
the “long term economic plan was
working.” He spoke of two million
more jobs and the coalition tax cuts.
Cameron defended attacks on his
immigration record by stressing
that the UK currently has the fastest
growing economy in any major
western country, naturally resulting
in people wanting to come here. He
predictably focused his attacks on
Labour, and expressed concern that
voting for Miliband would “put us
back to square one.” The PM declared
that the problem with Miliband is
that he “still doesn’t think Labour
borrowed and spent too much,” and
told the audience about a letter left
by Labour at the Treasury in 2010
which read “I’m sorry, we’ve ran out
of money.”
The Conservative leader came
out strong for the NHS, calling
it the UK’s “most important
national institution” that provided
“unbelievable care” for his severely
disabled son. Cameron claimed that
there are now 9000 more doctors
and 20000 fewer bureaucrats, and
promised to implement seven-day
operation for A&E and GP surgeries.
In response to attacks from Ed
Miliband on the number of zero hour
contracts, Cameron told the audience
about claims that 70 labour MPs
currently employ people on zero hour
contracts.
On immigration, Cameron laid
out plans for new policies that would
stop immigrants from claiming
benefits until they have lived and
paid into the country for four years
and prevent migrant workers from
sending money to dependents who
live overseas. The PM promised an
in-out referendum on Europe in 2017
after renegotiations to “get a better
deal for Britain.”
Ed Miliband - Labour
Ed Miliband focused his attacks on
Cameron’s record, claiming that “over
the last five years wages haven’t kept
up with bills.”
He promised to raise the minimum
wage to £8 an hour and “rescue the
NHS by hiring more doctors and
nurses.” Labour’s cut in tuition fees
from six to nine thousand was not
criticised by the other leaders, while
Miliband promised to cut the deficit
every year while reversing the tax
cut for millionaires and making
“common sense spending reductions,
where outside the NHS and education
system spending will fall.”
The Labour leader set out a NHS
“time to care fund” coming from a
new mansion tax on properties worth
over £2 million, a banker’s bonus
tax and unexplained money coming
from tobacco companies. The Labour
leader attacked Cameron on the
NHS, claiming that “over one million
people waited in A&E for more than
four hours.”
Miliband plans to prevent
immigrations from receiving benefits
for the first two years that they come
here, and will attempt to “stop the
undercutting of wages and working
conditions.” On the EU, Miliband
argued that “David Cameron has
marginalised us in Europe” and
asserted that he will not be holding a
referendum like the Tories.
In his closing speech, Miliband
reminded the audience that he will
“stand up to energy companies” and
implement a price freeze.
Nick Clegg – Liberal
Democrats
The abiding message from Nick
Clegg was that the Liberal Democrats
act as a moderating force in British
politics, who will stop the country
from “lurching to the left or
right.” The deputy prime minister
acknowledged that “no one is going to
win outright in this election,” but that
“the country is in a much better shape
than it was five years ago.”
Mr Clegg declared that the
Liberal Democrats have “the grit
and resilience to finish the job and
balance the books fairly” and did a
good job of positioning himself as
the reasonable compromise between
the two biggest parties. The Lib Dem
leader went on to say that the next
five years require more austerity but
emphasised that “It’s a balance. We
will cut less than tory, and borrow less
than labour.”
In an effort to distance himself
from his Coalition partner, Nick
Clegg attacked Mr Cameron on the
harsh cuts made in the coalition,
claiming that the prime minister
had executed “ideologically driven
cuts on schools” and that the “Tories
cut more because they want to,”
as opposed to the Lib Dem who
reluctantly feel that it is in the best
interests of the country’s current
finances.
“The NHS doesn’t need warm
words it needs hard cash.” Mr Clegg
also stated that “mental health has for
far too long been the poor cousin of
physical health.”
The deputy prime minister said
he “will never spread fear about
immigration” and “welcome people
who play by the rules,” before going
on to say that “without immigrants
the NHS would collapse overnight.”
The three female leaders shared
these positive sentiments towards
immigrants.
In one exchange between the
three biggest Westminster parties,
Mr Clegg asked Ed Miliband for
an apology about the state of the
economy that the coalition inherited.
This prompted a rare applause from
the audience. Miliband deflected the
criticism by attacking Cameron for
his statements while in opposition
that the banks were overregulated
before the 2008 crisis, “so I won’t take
any lectures from you.”
Mr Clegg defended his party’s
success in the coalition with the
pupil premium, income tax cuts
for millions of low earners and new
apprenticeships, before talking about
the Liberal Democrat ‘rent-to-own’
scheme for people trying to get onto
the property ladder.
The deputy prime minister intends
to raise more money by closing reliefs
in capital gains tax. He closed his
speech by highlighting the Liberal
Democrat mission statement: “A
stronger economy and a fairer
society, with opportunity for all.”
Nicola Sturgeon – SNP
Nicola Sturgeon said she was
committed to changing the
Westminster system while “standing
up for Scotland’s best interests.”
She made it clear that she wants
Scottish independence and offered
an alternative to austerity, where the
UK “puts investment in children, not
nuclear weapons.” The SNP leader
claimed that “economic policies
shouldn’t be and end in itself,” and
would like to see “modest spending
increases” that stop “pushing people
into poverty.” While admitting that
this approach would “take longer to
pay off the debt,” Nicola Sturgeon
justified that it would “give money for
infrastructure and public services.”
She criticised the coalition’s “blind
commitment to austerity,” insisted
that “you can’t cut your way out of the
deficit” and won over the audience
after observing “it seems that there
is nothing Nigel Farage won’t blame
on foreigners.” After calling the NHS
“too precious for private profit,”
Nicola Sturgeon reemphasised lifting
people out of poverty and scrapping
trident, while creating an “education
system based on the ability to learn
not the ability to pay.”
Nigel Farage – UKIP
Nigel Farage quickly tried to distance
himself from the other leaders,
explaining that “all the other six
