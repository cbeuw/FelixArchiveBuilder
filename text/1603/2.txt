What’s on this
week:
Medics’ Light Opera
24-Hour Musical
May 2nd, 19:00, Union
Concert Hall
ISCM Light Opera Society
return to perform a musical
learnt and rehearsed in just
24 hours.
The cast and crew find out
the show on Friday night,
before spending the entire
night and day getting ready
for curtain up on Saturday.
Skett’s been listening to the
Mamma Mia soundtrack
all week, so take it from
her: musicals are great. You
should go to one.
General Election Live
in the Felix Office
May 7th, 23:30, Felix Office
Planning on staying up all
night to follow the #GE2015
results? Us too! Come to the
Felix Office after we’ve got
next week’s paper out to
watch the results unfold.
Come if you like politics,
come if you don’t, we don’t
mind. I don’t even know
what politics is.
Planning another Library
all-nighter to catch up on
revision? Us neither. Come
procrastinate with us, we
have Diet Coke.
