ICVC sees their mens team becoming BUCS Trophy Champions
Imperial’s Volleyball club is served sweet
sucess this year
The start of the year already
hinted at a great volleyball
season to come; with over 120
people attending the taster session
and a record-high membership of 87.
After an absence of two years, the
women’s BUCS team returned to the
first division for the 2014-15 season.
Throughout the season the women’s
team had a solid performance even
when it was at times a struggle. An
example being the away match vs
Kent University, for which, due to
illnesses and work deadlines, the
team travelled with only the bare
minimum of six players (our libero
having to play opposite).
Not having the luxury of
substitutes, the 5-set match left the
players exhausted. Even though it
was a 3-2 loss our players should be
proud of the fight they put up in
this extremely close match. By the
end of the season, the IC women’s
BUCS team took the third place
in the league, only below the well-
deserved first place for University
of East London and second place for
University College London. The final
league standings only confirm that
the team deserved the promotion to
first division.
The men’s BUCS team looked
promising with a number of
returning players as well as new
high-level recruits. The men were on
course for a promotion to the Premier
League, having only lost their away
match to Portsmouth.
All hopes were therefore placed
on the Portsmouth home match as
a win would have resulted in a first

place in the league and a promotion
play-off match. Unfortunately, the
great success the men were achieving
in their Trophy competition, meant
clashes with league matches and
much rescheduling, ultimately
resulting in the men’s team having to
play three crucial matches in the final
week of the BUCS season.
The home match against
Portsmouth ended up having to be
played in a training slot and with
some challenging circumstances
the men’s team were unfortunately
unable to reach their full potential,
losing 3-1 to a strong Portsmouth.
Regardless of the disappointment
of not getting first position in the
league the men were determined to
come away with a win for the BUCS
Trophy competition. Throughout the
Trophy knockout matches the men
remained undefeated, not even losing
a single set.
Overcoming many worries and
uncertainties about the Final in
Loughborough (the match being on a
Tuesday in the final week of term(!)),
the whole team eventually made it to
the final match.
Specially thanks to the support
of Sport Imperial who were
instrumental in ensuring player
availability and transport. The result
speaks for itself, the BUCS men
became BUCS Trophy Champions
in an impressive performance in
a match of just under an hour,
defeating Northumbria 2nd
3-0 (25-16,
25-8, 25-13).
Besides the competitive success,
the Club had many other greats and
firsts this season expanding our
reach as a club beyond the volleyball
community at Imperial. ICVC
introduced charity matches, raising
money on two occasions for the
charities Prostate Cancer and MAG
(Mines Advisory Group) respectively.
The Club also had numerous mixed
training sessions including friendly
mixed tournaments, always with
chocolate prizes!
Food is also generally the focal
point at our socials, having many
skilled cooks and bakers among
our members, bringing dishes such
as tiramisu, spanakopita, lemon
cheesecake, brownies and much more
home-made goodness.
Following on from this year, we
cannot wait to see what next season
brings!
