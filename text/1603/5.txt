Results criticised by external academics: “Imperial doesn’t get it.”
Alice Gast: Professors are
under pressure and they have a
lot on their plates
Alice Gast,the President of
Imperial,was asked about Grimm
and the pressures on academics
on Radio 4 just last month.
Tanya Beckett,presenter of the
Today Programme said to Gast:
“Professor Stefan Grimm took his
own life at the end of last year…
that is a demonstration that
pressures in the academic world
can become unbearable.”
Gast did not address the
death of the Professor directly,
talking about the importance
of collaboration in research,
although she did state that:
“Professors are under pressure
and they have a lot on their plates,
professors are like small business
owners…it is a highly competitive
world out there.”
An Imperial spokesperson
released a statement to Felix
yesterday,saying that:“Imperial
has a duty of care to all who
work for it.We strive to create
an environment in which
everyone understands what
is expected of him or her,how
they are supported in meeting
expectations and able to perform
to their best.
“Stefan’s colleagues supported
him and made great efforts to
help him achieve the success he
sought.
“In the months since Stefan’s
death Imperial has examined
more broadly how it supports
staff during performance reviews.
In March all members of Imperial
staff received the report and
recommendations of a review into
this subject,with all staff invited
to respond.
“The College is currently working
through these responses
as part of its preparations
for implementing the
recommendations in the report.”

The inquest into the death of
Professor of toxicology Stefan
Grimm, 51, took place last
month, six months after he was found
dead in his own home in Northwood,
Middlesex.
The inquest heard how Grimm was
at the informal stage of the College’s
performance management process
after struggling to acquire enough
grant money for research, months
before his death. The inquest ruled
that Grimm had taken his own life by
asphyxiating himself.
On April 7th
The West London
Coroner’s Court also heard the report
from Imperial’s internal review of
staff policies in response to Grimm’s
death, which featured recommended
changes, including increasing support
for struggling staff members.
The senior coroner, Chinyere
Inyama, noted how the funding issues
were clearly mounting stress on the
professor, and cited Grimm’s death as
“needless.”
However, Imperial’s own director
of Human Resources, Louise Lindsay,
who led the internal review, admitted
at the inquest that the changes still
might not have prevented Grimm’s
suicide.
An Imperial spokesperson has
since told Felix that “Given the
complex nature of suicide, it would be
impossible to answer with certainty
whether any action taken by the
College could have resulted in a
different outcome.”
The internal review has also been
heavily criticised online by other
academics based at Oxford University
and University College London.
Grimm’s death hit national
headlines last October after a
posthumous email sent in his name
accused Imperial of mistreatment of
staff and stated that: “This is not a
university anymore but a business.”
He continued: “What these guys
don’t know is that they destroy lives.
Well, they certainly destroyed mine.”
In his email, time stamped as sent
after his death, Grimm explained how
he had received an “ultimatum email”
from Professor Martin Wilkins, his
line manager, in March of last year,
detailing how Grimm was being
placed under informal review.
Wilkins explained that although
he was aware of Grimm’s dedication
to try and find funding, he was still
“struggling to fulfil the metrics of a
Professorial post at Imperial College.”
Wilkins then stated that should
Grimm fail to secure a £200,000
programme grant in the next
twelve months, he would have to
consider taking further, formal
action in accordance to the College’s
current policies for managing poor
performance.
The internal review conducted
by Imperial outlined how Grimm
was actually under what is known
informal review for nearly two years
but no further formal action was
taken in relation to his progress.
The review stated that: “the formal
stages would have provided more
clarity to Professor Grimm on process
and support through the written
documentation, representation at
meetings and HR involvement.”
However, other staff that had been
through performance management
(similar to that undergone by Grimm)
also contacted the reviewers, with
it being noted in that: “there were
a number of cases where staff did
not feel that they had received the
support that they needed.”
The review also addressed the
training of management staff, the
timescale and progression of informal
and formal review processes, and
the resources available from HR for
disciplinary procedures.
The recommendations included
introducing performance and
disciplinary training to managers and
requesting that managers notify the
Human Resources department before
putting employers under informal
review.
The review also suggested that
template emails and letters should
be created for correspondence
concerning performance
management, and that HR also
reviews all correspondence before
being sent.
The report concluded with
recommendations for improvements
that were presented to the provost
board on the 27th
February. The
recommendations were accepted.
The review was completed by
Lindsey and the Senior Consul,
Professor Richard Thompson,
and was sent by James Stirling, the
Provost of the College, to all heads
of department. He has since received
further feedback, that he said in an
all staff email sent on Tuesday that
they will be taking on board when
implementing the recommendations.
However, some academics
have criticised the suggested
improvements, stating that they
simply add more bureaucracy, or are
unlikely to make a difference.
In a letter posted on the Times
Higher Education website, Dorothy
Bishop, a professor of developmental
neuropsychology at the University
of Oxford, stated that targets in
academia related to performance and
achieving grant need to be abolished.
Bishop said in the letter: “I am
distressed to find that Imperial just
doesn’t get it, and seems to think that
it can avoid future tragedies by just
“managing” people and “supporting”
them in dealing with the crazy targets
that they are confronted with.”
David Colquhoun, a professor
of pharmacology from University
College London, criticised the new
recommendations as being steeped
in bureaucracy, and stated the
suggestions would simply act as a
“Smokescreen for carrying on as at
present.”
He also said when Grimm’s email
first surfaced, that “It just seems
Imperial are doing their best to
whitewash it. They rarely get to the
heart of the matter.”
Grimm was working on developing
treatments for cancer, and he had
already published four papers in that
year based on his research.
The Reporter, Imperial’s own
in-house staff newsletter, published
an obituary for Grimm, five months
after his death.
Written by colleagues from his
Apoptosis research group, they
described Grimm as a “terrific
mentor, deeply committed to all the
projects running in his lab… he was a
very gentle and caring person, a man
of his word, working tirelessly for his
students and postdoctoral scientists.
“Stefan will be greatly missed by
his current and former lab partners,
colleagues and collaborators around
the world.”
