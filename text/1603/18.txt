Jonathan Masters investigates the latest
entrepreneurial endeavour by the Imperial
graduate who prefers to pour his own pint
Do you want a
firetruck with your
beer?
Craft beer has seen an
exponential increase in
popularity in the last four years,
and with that increased demand have
come entrepreneurs seeking to profit.
However, some of those capitalising
on the trend were more likely to
be found in the lab than down the
bar only a few years ago. Imperial
chemistry graduate, Douglas
Hunt, is one such scientist turned
entrepreneur, although his idea
comes with a novel twist: Doug has
retrofitted a fire engine into a beer-
dispensing-festival-serving device
under his company Pour Your Pint.
Doug studied chemistry at Imperial,
before spending a year as a sabbatical
officer for Imperial College Union.
When he left Imperial, he went on
to work in the field of accountancy,
where he met his other two business
partners, Laurence Culloty and
Laurence Tarr.
I caught up with Laurence Culloty
last Saturday in in Tottenham Hale to
discuss craft beer, their plans for the
future, and the political influence of
Al Murray.
After the longest tube journey
I’ve ever taken, I emerged from the
tube station, immediately seeing a
crowd of bearded twenty-somethings.
Already I had an inkling that they
were probably going to a craft
beer brewery, and sure enough,
after following the bearded crowd
I eventually found the industrial
estate, they were there, right next to a
beer dispensing fire engine.
The fire engine in question has six
self-service points supplied by one of
Pour Your Pints’ partners, Robot Pub
Group, with each one of them being
able to be filled with any beverage of
the event organiser’s choice. Their
website boasts: “We realise that
people enjoy drinks bars most when
they are part of the action. That’s why
we created the worlds first fire truck
mobile outdoor bar which features
self serve technology.”
Laurence remarked that the
idea originally came about when
he and his other future business
partners were in a long queue at
a festival waiting for a beer, and
getting increasingly frustrated over
missing the acts. They thought that
there had to be a quicker way to get
a beer, and, after copious research,
they discovered that the self-service
technology existed, and so decided to
find a way to bring it to the portable
market.
The fire engine as a method
of transportation was originally
Laurence’s father’s idea, stemming
from a friend that converted a
fire engine into a radio station
over thirty years ago. The three
accountants researched began to look
for something that could transport
itself easily. They initially had a
look at slipstream caravans and the
Routemaster buses, but in the end
they felt that the fire engine wasn’t
really something that had been done
before. After a tense but successful
venture onto eBay, the fire engine was
purchased.
Luckily there weren’t too many
obstacles in financing their business,
since it was from their collective
personal savings. Laurence did admit
to me that their cash flow was not
ideal at this moment in time, but
their collective optimism for their
business has made the investment
worth it in their minds.
In the next five years Laurence
hoped to expand the business to a
wider market, making themselves the
prime company when it comes to self-
service technology to the festivals and
events market.
Somewhat bizarrely, the fire engine
has attracted considerable attention
from Al Murray, the comedian whose
act centres around the musings of
a typical pub landlord. Al Murray
recently travelled in the fire engine
as a way to announce his satirical
campaign in the upcoming election
in the Thanet constituency, running
against Nigel Farage, leader of the
UKIP.
Laurence told how it originated
from the Robot Pub group who
had a contact in the Avalon group
(Al Murray’s agent), and they were
talking about the Pour Your Pint
venture late one night, and he was
talking about his political venture. He
contacted Pour Your Pint and next
thing you know, he was riding in the
engine through the streets of Thanet.
When I asked Laurence if he
had any thoughts on the nature of
his satire and the state of British
politics, Laurence was initially quite
cautious, declaring that he wasn’t
going to broadcast his political views,
obviously quite wary of his new
company’s reputation.
He did admit that there were
certain elements of Murray’s
performance that had an element of
truth to them: one quip Murray said
was that although many politicians
break their promises, he was going
to promise to not keep any of his
promises. “I think there’s definitely
an element of truth to that”, Laurence
replied, before we went and got
another pint.
Craft beer has increased in
popularity over the past few years,
even being added to the basket of
goods for calculating inflation;
however I was curious as to whether
or not this is just a transient fad.
During the course of the day,
Beavertown brewery opened its doors
to those that had come to the event,
revealing a giant warehouse with
several large distilleries.
Opened in 2011, Beavertown has
gone from strength to strength,
before moving to Tottenham Hale in
May 2014. I managed to talk to one of
the brewers about the merits of craft
beer: “Once you get distilleries of this
size, it gets really difficult to make a
shit beer and I think to make a good
craft beer there has to be something
unique about it.”
Laurence also sounded in on this
stating that “There’s a lot more
variety of flavours, and ability to
experiment with craft beers.”
This was definitely true with many
of Beavertown’s brands: there was a
particularly interesting Grapefruit
IPA (Indian Pale Ale), as well as a
