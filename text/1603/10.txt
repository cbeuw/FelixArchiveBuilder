I’m Alex Savell,the current Deputy
President (Finance and Service)
sabbatical officer,and I have been
overseeing the development of
our policy on higher education
funding,and ensuring local MP
candidates consider the priorities
of our students that reside in their
constituencies.
Imperial College Union has been
pushing forwards with its Fund
Education Fairly campaign,in an
attempt to lobby MP candidates to
consider the needs of students in
their constituencies.
As part of this,we’ve been
contacting all the candidates in
five constituencies where the most
Imperial students live: Kensington,
Cities of London and Westminster,
Hammersmith,Chelsea and
Fulham,and Battersea.
We’re lobbying MPs candidates
to consider our three key demands:
increase funding for living costs,
reverse fee hikes and protect
International and Postgraduate
students from extortionate fees.
Their responses are live on the
Union website and we’ll be rating
them as Red,Amber or Green for
each issue as more responses come
in.There have been some great
levels engagements with us,but also
a lot of candidates who are as yet to
respond.
It can be difficult,when some of
our constituencies are seen as safe
seats to particularly get the larger
parties to engage–they all have
more to lose from a faux pas than to
gain from engagement.
We’ll be pushing for more
responses in the run up to election
day…we’ll be naming and shaming
those that haven’t replied us on
Twitter and if we get a few of you
guys to join in with the #FairFunding
I’m still hopeful that we can get the
majority of candidates to respond.
It’s also proved tough to categorise
responses even as basically as Green
(fully in agreement with us),Amber
(partially in agreement with us)
and Red (not in agreement with
us).How do you rank some of the
vague statements politicians make
or promises that seem to not be
backed up by concrete plans? I think
the fact is,all we can do as a Union
is present what they’ve responded
with at face value and trust that all
of you,as the best and brightest
students in the country,can draw
your own conclusions on how much
to trust the promises made.
How did we decide on the stances
in the first place?
When I was still a wide eyed council
member last year it was pointed out
that our Union stance on Higher
Education Funding was due to lapse.
With the election coming up in 2015
and feelings on the issue pretty raw
from the tripling of fees in direct
contravention of some campaign
promises we wanted to make sure
that we got a new policy in place.
For those that don’t know Council
is the top policy making board in
the Union (with the exception of
the Trustees themselves) it’s made
up of about 60 positions including
representation from all the faculties
and departments,the liberation
officers,the sabbatical officers and a
number of ordinary members.
Council last year decided to
ask the wider student body what
they thought,and ran our Higher
Education Funding survey to find
out what you think is a fair price to
pay for a university education.
The survey went through three or
four drafts; which went to council
for further input and was then
revised several times to make it
balanced and improve the amount
of time that could be taken.We
received about 300 responses to the
survey,which were then presented
to the Union General Meeting before
Christmas.Although under quorate,
those in attendance engaged in
a healthy discussion and a new
proposed stance taken to Council for
students to finally agree on.
Eventually,we had our stance; we
agreed that Imperial College Union
officially supports significantly
reduced tuition fees,alongside
some other measures.
The stance has a really strong
mandate and a balanced position
with lobbying targets within college,
within the government and,perhaps
most notably,for the Election
Campaign.
I’m really proud of the result; you
can still see it
at imperialcollegeunion.org/
policies.

How is the Union lobbying MPs this year?
If you paid attention to your
news feed in the last week, the
likelihood is that the story of the
National Union of Students (NUS)
spending £40,000 on a campaign
against the Liberal Democrats has
come across your radar.
The most iconic of the posters
displays two clenched fists, with
the words ‘liar liar’ tattooed across
the knuckles with the first ‘I’ being
pointed with the Liberal democrat
logo. The NUS describes the campaign
as seeking to end the “cycle of broken
promises.”
Their website describes how
“In 2010 hundreds of thousands
of students were abandoned by
politicians who broke their promise
on tuition fees… They traded lies for
power.”
The main purpose of the campaign
is to encourage students to vote
against MPs who broke their pledges
not to raise tuition fees, although the
posters are specially targeting the
Liberal Democrat party, something
some students aren’t too happy about.
Critics are keen to point out that
other MPs too broke similar pledges,
but were not necessarily members of
the same party. Other members of the
NUS are questioning the necessity
of such expenditure on what is being
called “a political smear campaign.”
The campaign has received even
more press due to the fact that
national rail has refused to display
the billboards for any longer,
emphasizing that it has no expressed
desire to have a political opinion as a
company.
One commentator online suggested:
“The NUS need to stay politically
neutral. Why should our union fees
go towards pushing a political agenda
we never said we support?
“Furthermore why does the NUS
act as if they speak on behalf of all
students?”
Joseph Miles, a PPE final year
student at Wadham college
recently saw his counter campaign,
#trolltheNUS, go viral, after sharing a
page on facebook named: ““Troll the
NUS executive; donate to the Liberal
Democrats!”
He told the Oxford Student: I never
expected the #trollNUS campaign
to take off like this. When I heard of
the #liarliar campaign, and having
seen the NUS’s increasingly desperate
attempts to plug it on social media,
I started the Facebook event…as a
joke and invited several people who I
know are Lib Dems at Oxford.
“I do think the NUS has a problem
with accountability, and its internal
structures are almost impossible to
understand.
“Clearly I am not the only person
who thinks that the NUS has become
dominated by small internal cliques
who are nowhere near representative
of the entire student body.”
An article on the Liberal Democrat
Voice website, targeted for Lib Dem
supporters, pointed out that the
campaign is not endorsing those
MPs that did keep to their pledge.
They also asked: “Where was their
campaign against Labour MPs who
introduced tuition fees and top-up
fees when they said they wouldn’t?”
Some are more sympathetic to
the cause; many commentators who
sympathised with the campaign,
citing the fact that the student
population needs to be reminded
of the broken promises, and even
offering the point that this campaign
will put more pressure on the Labour
party to follow through with their
plan of reducing tuition fees.
When I contacted Brian Alcorn,
President of the Lincoln Student
Union and a heavily involved
member of the NUS, he did offer
the fact that the campaign was
originally voted on at last years
NUS Conference in the form of a
mandate to hold those who raised
the tuition fees accountable: “In the
grand scheme of things, it’s not a lot
of money, and we did vote on it last
year,” he told Felix.
Despite the protests, however, three
more billboards are planned to be
put up at London Victoria, Sheffield
Central, and Manchester Piccadilly
from midnight Wednesday until
May 8.
The NUS leader Toni Pearce cited
large amount of bitterness within the
student population: "Students queued
to vote for the Lib Dems in 2010 on
the sole basis of this pledge. It wasn't
a minor misdemeanour. It was an
outright lie. We have an obligation
to hold them to account for this, and
we will."
Will the billboards even make
a difference to student voting?
Although it is too soon to tell, they
are certainly generating debate
around the topic, which can only be
seen as good thing.
