The Miraculous Mooney
(continued from p.l)
date u n t i l 9 a.m. on Sunday, giving Mr. Mooney
and his s t a f f barely a day in which to prepare
for, serving about 400 lunches using new and
strange equipment. A senior member of the
I.C. Administration informed the President
that he could not see how the Refectory could
possibly be used u n t i l Friday, 12th. However,
"cometh the hour, cometh the man.''
But even worse was to come. On Sunday morn-
ing the kitchens and the serving hatch were
s t i l l swarming with workmen. Mr. Mooney could
not start u n t i l 4.50 p.m. The "working squad"
who were to carry the heavy packages of equip-
ment from their storing place i n the Snack Bar
across to the Refectory packed up their bags
and went home. Not u n t i l about 6 p.m. could
Mr. Mooney and his kitchen staff begin their
move, and they were assisted by eight volunt-
eers from the Hostel.

IG AND THEM it
On Monday morning the kitchen was a scene
of chaos. Remnants of painters and t i l e r s were
f i n i s h i n g o f f their work. The only sign of food
was a huge bowl of steaming soup being vigorous-
l y s t i r r e d by " K i t " , who has been a cook at I.C.
for t h i r t y years and who knew of worse times
than this during the war. She shouted cheerfully
"Don't worry dear, the lads'11 have their lunch
at 12." Meanwhile dusty plates had been stacked
into the new washing machine. The switch was
pressed, the brushes revolved - but unfortun-
ately i n the wrong direction, and their effect
was not to clean the plates but to f l i n g a
spray of water a l l over the kitchen. Elsewhere
Mr. Mooney was peering into a large pan of f a t .
Dense black smoke rose into his face and more
fat was flung i n to avert a conflagration. With
the kitchen awash i n one comer and threatening
to become aflame i n another, Mooney and Co.bat-
tled on, and so over four hundred people obtain-
ed t h e i r lunch l i t t l e r e a l i s i n g the drama that
had gone before. I t i s as well to retain a sense
of humour In such troublesome times as this !
The Union w i l l make some o f f i c i a l recognit-
ion of this tremendous e f f o r t by the kitchen
and counter s t a f f , and by Mr. Mooney himself,
in due course. In addition, every member of the
Union w i l l have a chance to show his own apprec-
i a t i o n when the annual collection i s made at
Christmas. Meanwhile, take i t easy i n the Sug-

The Story So Far: The King of Epsom, magnetic
i r r e s i s t i b l e YUL BRYNNER (see Carlton Cinema
posters), i s i n hiding under an assumed name
at I.C., where he grows a crystal on a piece
of s t r i n g and controls the Students' Union. He
has revealed his true identity only to his sec-
retary RANDY ANDY, erstwhile C & G . spanner-
c a r r i e r and dare-devil A i r Squadron p i l o t , now
ostensibly a Chem. Eng. research student. Be-
fore he can defeat his enemies, return to his
kingdom, and devote his declining years to
c r i c k e t , YUL must regain the Union's building.
His lieutenants on the top-level Executive
Committee are fair-haired, bonhomous chief
s c i e n t i s t TONY GOODINGS, director-general of
the F i r e Brigade; the Rhodesian squash-playing,
butterfly-fancying head of the powerful Engin-
sers' Union, JOHN L. HART, ("Jack Speck" to the
Brompton Road coffee bars); and t a l l , suave
MIKE T. (for Tycoon) RUTTER, the gentleman
mineworker. These three plan evening r a l l i e s
to stimulate t h e i r supporters, while RANDY ANDY
w i l l harangue a monster meeting i n the Albert
Hall on October 25th. YUL retrieves the
Unions* furniture from robbers, but an attempt
i s made to assassinate him on Freshers' Day by
causing him to t r i p on his gown. The plot
thickens. What i s the role of a l l u r i n g , enig-
matic Miss WENDY PIPE, leader of the feminists?
W i l l the building be regained? Can YUL trust
his lieutenants? Will he survive the Commemor-
ation Ball? Now Read On.
DEBATING SOCIETY TRIALS.
On Thursday 11th. October, 18 freshers and
about 8 old legs met i n the small physics
Theatre to have a free tea and join i n the
debating t r i a l s . Each speaker was given three
minutes i n which to prepare a speech either
for or against a motion given to him by the
chairman, Mr T.Smith; this speech was to l a s t
for three minutes. A l l 18 freshers spoke thus
proving i t wasn't just the tea that attracted
them.
The standard shown augurs well for debating
at I.C. this year, for although the motions
were d i f f i c u l t and the time short, most of the
speakers combined substance and gloss f a i r l y
neatly and definite style could be seen i n many
of them. Debating had a good season at I.C.
l a s t year, there seems to be no reason why this
year shouldn't be even better.
