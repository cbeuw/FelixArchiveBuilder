P. G ' S A-HIRE
The origin of the idea f o r this particular
holiday i s rather obscure, but was probably a
>
flash of inspiration occasioned by the brilliant
weather in early May and the desire of two over-
worked goon-type mechanical P.G."a to cool o f f
i n quantities of water.
Frantic; searching i n boating magazines i n the
l i b r a r y , followed by the expenditure of much cash i n
the Guild'3 'phone box - suitably punctuated with pauses
for fresh a i r and impatient demands of ".he" intending
users - e l i c i t e d the information that the . s t, week i n
August was within thenpst expensive season and +
hr.t
there appeared to be only one boat on the Thames
araiilable f o r h i r e . In the backwaters of Thames Iotton,
and just about a f l o a t , we found a "cruiser' oapable of
accsomodating only two at a time at night - and; then in
separate berths - that want by the doubtful name of
" 'Maid' Marjory".
The original idea had included our respective
fiancees, the most recent of whom had been the subject
of a lost bet and a round of sherry i n the early hours
of the ncrning at the Engineer's Ball. But nothing vent-
ured etc. and completely undaunted your scribes l e f t a
deposit on Marjory and departed, only to return on
the l a s t Saturday evening i n August - arriving between
the showers - complete with baggage, and one tent to
f i l l the gap i n the berthing arrangements.
"Strewth that ours ! ?" was the general eminent.
Old i t looked and o l d i t was, as her subsequent whims
and fancies proved. At least, the paint was watertight,
but there was nothing we oould do - especially when the
roof l e t in the rain - except satisfy the furious de-
mands of an i n e f f i c i e n t bilge-pump. Old though Marjory
was she was capable of inaintaining a steady 6 amps -
5 knots by rough calibration - or even eight when
pushed, s u f f i c i e n t , with the a i d of wind and patient
lock-keepers, to swamp the stunts i n the punts and
keep up with far more modern, larger and powerful
craft.
So i t was that with L-plates all but
flapping i n the breeze, we set out from Thames
Ditton, feeling our way i n the fast approach-
ing darkness, described a figure-of-eight and
3pent the night in complete respectability
beneath the walls of Hampton Court.
The next morning, of course, produoed our first
big teat. With heart in mouth, hands on throttle and
clutch, instruction manuals spread before, the crew
at the ready with ropes, fenders, boat-hook and mop,
Maid Marjory successfully negotiated Hampton Lock -
more by instinct on her part than skill on ours 1
And 30 a l l went well for the whole of one week
in quite fair weather. Of course, there were the odd
scrapes, as the concrete embankment at Sconing - now
sporting some curious streaks of green paint - and
the fender wrenched bodily from the gunwale — screws
and a l l - at Henley, will testify. Then there was
the boat-hook left at Shepperton on the way back
whilst hurried attention was paid to the rules relat-
ing to toilet disposal.
The scenery along the Thames i s really worth
seeing and i t gets prettier the further you go. It is;
typical pastoral England at its best, and i s f u l l
of endless interest and variety. For those who are
interested, tnere are pubs galore and many have a
quaint, olde-worlde, unspoilt charm of their own.
Especially do we recommend 'The Swan' at Streatley
- 10 varieties of Harveys' Sherries J
Plenty to do ? Yes, especially with the boat
to attend to in many ways and the needs of the crew,
and locks every few miles. From first-hand exper-
ience we can provide you with a guide entitled
'Gents we have known along the Thames.' But beware
the agony when you arrive at the fortunately very
rare look where there are no facilities. We did hear
that there i s one good one for the ladies at Caver-
sham Bridge, but apart from that - it's very much
a case of 'wait and see'.
For those contemplating a cheap holiday in new,
exciting, amusing and interesting novel circumstances

each - a l l in. And for the fun you get out of i t ,
it's cheap at twice the price.
