THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE

UNION
PROGRESS
The f a i l u r e of the contractors to complete
the new Union building by the original schedule
of October 1st. has plunged the Union Into the
most d i f f i c u l t few weeks of i t s l i f e . Not only
i s the new building not ready, but many of tem-
porary f a c i l i t i e s available last year have gone.
Several clubs have had to accept emergency meas-
ures and have done so with admirable tolerance.
Added to the temporary arrangements l i s t e d i n
the l a s t F e l i x i s a Committee Room on the Fourth
Floor (Sast side) of the New Hostel. This can be
reached by entering the Staff B i l l i a r d s Room
and going through the door on the l e f t . The
S t a f f B i l l i a r d s Room i s available to students
a f t e r 5 p.m. - bookings can be made i n the
book by the Hostel letter-rack.
Progress i n the rest of the new building i s
not e l e c t r i f y i n g . In fact, i t i s pathetic. The
next noteworthy advance w i l l be on Tuesday,
November 6th. when the Dining H a l l , Senior
Common Room, Reading Room and I.C.W.A. Lounge
w i l l be opened. Unfortunately the l i s t of
rooms to which top p r i o r i t y should be given,
drawn up by Union o f f i c e r s l a s t July, seems to
have been ignored. A request was. then made
that, i n the event of an emergency, efforts
should be concentrated on the ground floor and
the dining-hall. With refectories, lounge,
bar, notice-boards and cloakrooms at least the
Union Centre would have been back i n Its r i g h t -
f u l abode, without the need for a great upheav-
al i n the middle of the year. The three rooms
on the Bast side of the 1st. floor which are
to be opened on Nov. 6th. are non-essentials,
and workmen w i l l be above and below them for
two or three reeks.
The remainder of the building ( i t i s a l l e g -
ed) w i l l be finished by the end of November,
Including the Gymnasium and Upper Refectory.
Although rea&onp.ble progress i s apparent i n
the Concert Hall (which may even be i n a s u f f -
i c i e n t l y advanced stage to be used for the
Union meeting on Oct. 23rd.) and the lounge,
the top floor (Bast side) and Bar have jolted
to a complete s t a n d s t i l l . Apparently i t i s
impossible to engage enough workmen to f i n i s h
off a l l the rooms simultaneously. The top
f l o o r was so nearly finished l a s t July that i t
seems incredible that i t i s s t i l l ' i n the same
state now. The table tennis and b i l l i a r d s rooms
would have been p a r t i c u l a r l y welcome.
During these months of agonisingly slow
progress the unenviable task of being the d i r -
ect negotiator with the contractors has f a l l e n
on Dr. Sparkes and Mr. Briggs of the Planning
earn* chosen

Thanks to a magnificent and determined
e f f o r t by the Refectory Manager, Mr. Mooney,
and his loyal s t a f f , i t was possible to open
the Lower Refectory i n time for lunch on Mon-
day, October 8th. This was despite a series
of setbacks which would have surely demoral-
ised a lesser man.
Mr. Mooney i s one of those comparative
r a r i t i e s among administrators who r e a l i s e that
students are the one essential ingredient of
a college and that their needs and welfare
must come before a l l else. He accordingly set
about his colossal task with his characteristic
refusal to be flustered.
Mr. Mooney had been informed that the
kitchens said Refectory would be available for
him to move i n on Thursday, October 4th., thus
.giving him reasonable time to prepare for the
following Monday. Despite vigorous exhortat-
ions from the Planning Department, the con-
tractors had to postpone this a v a i l a b i l i t y

Department. They have worked with great vigour
in t h e i r attempts to obtain more rapid progress.
Those who are familiar with Dr. Sparkes' person-
a l i t y , and who know his keen and genuine i n t e r -
est i n student a f f a i r s (he has been an active
President of the Rugger Club for 10 years ),
w i l l be confident that there could not possibly
have been a more suitable person i n this respon-
s i b l e position.
More news at the Union meeting next Tuesday.
