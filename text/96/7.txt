Twelve members of I.C. met i n Saas Fee i n Switzer-
land this summer f o r the Karakoram Expedition Training
Meet. The main object was to get experience i n high 1
level camping on glaciers and snow f i e l d s and to get
to know the other members of the team. For the f i r s t
week one party of six did a high level traverse from
Saas Fee to Zermatt v i a the Alphubeljock, Allalinpass
and Adlerpass, several camps being only just short of
the 4000 meter mark. Peaks climbed included the
A l l a l i n h o m , Alphubel, Strahlhorn, Adlerhorn and Himp-
fischorn. The other party climbed from the Mischibel
Hut on the Dom Leinspitze ridge but were severely
hampered by deep snow.
At Zermatt we exchanged equipment and the camping
party set o f f i n the Monte Rosa area. They traversed
under lionte Rosa, along the frountier ridge and down to
the Fluhalp and Zermatt, climbing on the way Castor,
the traverse of Monte Rosa, Gimma de Jazzi, Strahlhorn
and the Rimpfischhorn. The other party climbing from
huts d i d a p a r t i a l traverse of the Briethorn (not
completed because of bad snow), Castor, Dom, and the
f i r s t ascent of the Taschhorn that 3eason.
For the t h i r d week we interchanged parties and a l l
climbed from huts. Peaks climbed included the Zinal
Rothorn, Obergablehorn, Matterhom and an unsuccessful
attempt was made on the Weisshorn. At the end of the
week we met i n Brig railway station, a l l very happy,
d i r t y and well sunburnt after a most successful alpine
season.
RUGGER CLUB'S TRIALS
The club having lost many members of last years
successful 1st. XV, finds i t s e l f i n a position where
rapid team building i s necessary. A record intake
of freshers many of whom show great promise together
with those remaining from last year should however
ensure another good season f o r a l l the teams. Club
o f f i c i a l s watched 60 freshers playing i n the 3ix
t r i a l teams which turned up at Harlington on Saturday,
but due to the enormity of the task i t w i l l be some
weeks belore the merits of the respective players
get sorted out.
Our f i r s t match was on Sunday 14th October against
the London Springboks. This team i 3 well known to
previous members of I.C. teams, as much f o r the feverish
a c t i v i t y i n the bar after the match as f o r the high
standard of the opponents.
CROSS COUNTRY CLUB
The Cross Country Club trials are to be held next
Wednesday and Saterday at Petersham and thus i t is
difficult at present ot assess our potentialities for
the coming season. If however U.G's relay race on
Saturday i s any guide we should have a very strong
team.
The U.C. relay,6x1*7 miles, had a large entry
including most of the London teams as well as those
from Provincial Universities. Loughborough soon
took the lead and held i t throughout the race. Behind
them a fierce battle developed between I.C., U.C.
and Kings. Bonnet a fresher ran for the I.C. second
team and put up a particularly fast time whioh looks
well for the future. I.C. 1st. team finally came in
4th behind Loughborough, U.C. and Kings.
At the time of going to press there i s an a i r
of uncertainty surrounding the Boat Club.
