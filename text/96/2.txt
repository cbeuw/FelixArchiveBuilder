EXPEDITION
I C E L A N D
The small geological expedition to the east
j f Iceland this summer was a complete success,
and the four members returned from the eight
to ten weeks' v i s i t with the conviction that
i t had been an experience not to be missed.
The expedition car, an Austin A40 Countryman,
covered 4500 miles over roads that were at
times extremely poor, and gave very l i t t l e
trouble. Now we have returned to Bngland and
have commenced examination of the 600 rock-
specimens collected.
The f i r s t fortnight was devoted to a tour
of the c l a s s i c geological l o c a l i t i e s i n S.W.
and N. Iceland. We v i s i t e d Hveradalir where
the natural steam i s used to heat glasshouses
and grow tomatoes and bananas, and saw steam
emerging from the ground where a telegraph
poie had been driven i n . We t r i e d to ascend
the famous volcano Hekla, but after trudging
for some hours over the incredibly rough sur-
face of the 1947 lava were forced to abandon
the attempt. To our disappointment the volcano
did not erupt this year. We v i s i t e d an ice-cap
and a most impressive valley-glacier, and saw
some of the waterfalls for which Iceland i s
famous. We also saw a fascinating profusion of
volcanic feature* . and visited one area of hot
springs where dirty socks disintegrate an bsing
washed i n the hot water.
The rest of the time was spent making a
geological map of part of the f i o r d country i n
the east of Iceland, and on the whole the rocks
did what was expected of them. The expedition
members camped for p r a c t i c a l l y the whole of the
stay i n Iceland, and various members took d i f -
f e r i n g periods to become acclimatised to a l i f e
in a small tent and a diet i n which milk, mac-
aroni and 'pom' occupied prominent places. One
person was unlucky enough to have his tent
collapse on him one cold, wet and stormy night,
but he has now recovered from the shock.

The expedition to Norway this Summer was
highly successful and enjoyed by a l l who took
part. The two main objects of the expedition
were the investigation by the geologists and
meteorologists of the area round the Alfot
g l a c i e r and the surveying o/ the Grondalen
valley but as no information has so far been
obtained from expedition members about their
s c i e n t i f i c work, this report b r i e f l y describes
some of their other a c t i v i t i e s .
Chief among these, probably, was eating.
Readers may have imagined that explorers have
to be content with dry biscuits washed down
with mugs of cold cocoa and an occasional hunk
of reindeer meat, but this i s not how I.C.
organises i t s expeditions. We had a c a r e f u l l y
planned d i e t about which a learned panel of
doctors had sat i n consultation, and our every
want was catered for. Unfortunately the doc-
tors do not allow for the large appetites of
the l o c a l cows, who once made away with a large
part of our stores. Also, we were not provided
with any vitamin C - i t being assumed that large
quantities of b i l b e r r i e s would be available at
Grondalen, but i n actual fact the season did not

The party made up of ten botanists and zoo-
logists started out for the Rhdne delta on
August 14th. and were away for a month. Their
transport consisted of two taxis, one of which
had been adapted as a small lorry, and both
were grossly overloaded. Although these two
vehicles did not seem safe, most of the adven-
turers travelled quite comfortably. Exceptions
were the driver and co-driver of the small
l o r r y who were subjected to continuous vibrat-
ion, nauseating fumes and noise caused by a
faulty exhaust pipe.
The Great Camargue - the Rhone Delta - dest-
ination of the expedition, was found to be
hot, s t i c k y and populated by enormous mosquitos.
The combination of these factors, together with
the l o c a l wine (drunk because of the trouble
that had to be taken to s t e r i l i s e the drinking
water before use), unsettled a l l the t r a v e l l e r s .
They learnt quite a l o t about l i v i n g i n adverse
surroundings and i n carrying out ecological
work under d i f f i c u l t conditions.
The Great Camargue was l a t e r quitted for the
P e t i t Camargue with i t s islands of umbrella
pines among dry salt lakes. Vegetation in the
delta area being controlled by salty conditions
and thus being somewhat atypical, the expedit-
ion moved to Meome, north of Toulon, and spent
three days among pleasant Mediterranean oak
and pine forest at about 800'. The birds stud-
ied i n both areas were impressive, ranging from
flamingos and egrets to hoopoes, and some t r u l y
d e l i g h t f u l specimens discovered i n Stes. Maries.
The Journey cost each member less than 224
francs a day i n food (4/2d). Petrol cost each
person about Â£2 for the round t r i p . The two
taxis which gave such s t e r l i n g service are now,
to the chagrin of the party, to be sold to the
highest bidder.
It i s now the opinion of the team that i n fut-
ure expeditions of this nature fewer people, say
about six, would work better as a team. They r e -
gret that they paid l i t t l e attention to the con-
d i t i o n of their tyres before taking the two
taxis on to the Continent. They would have pre-
ferred faster and more robust transport even
though t r a v e l l i n g around i n old taxis dressed
in Bohemian a t t i r e seems to be the "done thing"

example of the best l a i d plans going astray.
There was no outbreak of scurvy however, a l -
though one of the symptoms, chronic somnolence,
was often i n evidence.
An o f f i c i a l film was shot of the expedition
and i t i s rumoured that as a result of some of
the a c t i v i t i e s recorded i n i t , one member i s
already i n serious trouble with his g i r l - f r i e n d .
