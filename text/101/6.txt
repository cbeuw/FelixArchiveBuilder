Conditions were i d e a l and a f a s t
open game ensued, I.C. opened the
•coring with a goal, the t r y being
soared by F.Fawkee following a good
run by C.Smith. Just before h a l f -
time O.X.T.S soared a t r y and don-

the I.C. team.
The seoond half opened with a
succession of forward rushes up and
down the f i e l d and honours remained
even. B.Hearn put I.C. ahead with.a
dropped goal and just before time,
K.Kins, shewing remarkable accel-

the race being won by U.C. with King'i

second, less than a minute behind
G i l l i g a n of U.C. The rest of the team
were evenly d i s t r i b u t e d throughout the
f i e l d of 37 runners.
The f i r s t team returned i n the
early hours of Sunday morning from the

sleepless nights and another l o s t match
to i t s c r e d i t l l t was a team of bleary-

SPORTS EDITORIAL
The idea that no re sport i s to be had
In the bar than on the playing fields
of Harlisgtoa i s opea to doubt. This
matter could be put te the teat By
the addition of a pego stick to the
bar's already sumptuous equipment.
Surely this i s indubitably an ins-
trument of sport worthy of the most
truculent and redeutable of drinkers.

The club made a good start to the t e n s
programme when both f i r s t and second U s
won their league matches.
The f i r s t eleven, against Westminster
College, lacked cohesion at the start,but
gained confidence inthe later stages,win-
ning by 2-1. The goals were scored by
Sroea and Sprunt.
The seconds overwhelmed Westminster 2nd.,
the f i n a l score being 9-1. On Saturday 19th.
this score was almost repeated when Birk-
beck 2nd. were beaten 9-2.
The second team are new leading this div-
ision of the league with a goal average of
44 f o r , and 10 against, having lost only one
game.
On Saturday 19th. the 1st. eleven had a
very enjoyable game against Old Cholmelians.
After being 3-0 down In the second half I.C.
fought jack strongly, but inspite of goals by
Weak and Sprunt we s t i l l lost 3-2.

I.C. avenged their 5-0 defeat by
the Selson before Christmas by
winning 4-1 at home last Thursday.
A 5-0 defeat with one pint per
head per game as a side stake i s
a very expensive sport, so the
return game began i n an atmos-
phere of some apprehension. " Kitch
(Capt.) won the f i r s t game for I.C.
with a magnificent , i f some-
what fortuitous, double 4.
Fortified by h&rdwon pints, I.C.
went from strength to strength,
and a double 10 by Tom Banks made
i t 2-0 After this memory becomes
a l i t t l e hazy, but a good time was
had by a l l , and the bitter f r u i t s
of victory tasted good .
