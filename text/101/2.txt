When the return of the Union to
i t s o l d home was postponed u n t i l
January 14th i t was thought that even
at the slow rate of progress being
achieved, there should be ample time
f o r the ground f l o o r and the rest of
the eastern half of the building to
be finished. However, there seems to
be no end to t h i s tragic story, and
some time during the Christmas vaca-
t i o n the heating arrangements f o r the
cloakroom and ground f l o o r entrance
h a l l were completely re-organised
(surely t h i s could have been done any
time i n the L'^st two years?) Thi3 i n -
volved knocking holes through eighteen
inch walls and i n the f l o o r , and set
back the cloakroom by several weeks.
So much f o r set-back number one.
Set-back number two came when, although
the Union had made a precise and de-
t a i l e d l i s t of notice-board require-
ments no less than eighteen months ago,
i t was discovered i n the Planning Office
that none had been ordered. Hence the
present temporary arrangements, h a s t i l y
completed just before the start of the
term.
Experience with tne Refectories,
Concert H a l l and Bar has shown that
the only way to produce any marked:
progress i n the work i s to i n s i s t on
a c e r t a i n deadline and move i n whether
the workmen have finished or not. Even
then a great deal seems to be l e f t un-
t i l the very l a s t minute. For instance
during the vacations two cork f l o o r s
had to be l a i d and the floors to the
Concert H a l l and table-tennis room had
to be sanded and treated f o r two or
three days. I t was arranged that t h i s
should be done between January the 2nd
and the 10th. Despite frequent appeals
by tiie college t h i s work d i d not begin
u n t i l the 10th and was not f i n i s h e d un-
t i l the 17th. The hand-rails to the
central staircase make another sad
story. Tne holes into which these are
f i t t e d were o r i g i n a l l y made i n the
wrong positions so thjy had to be f i l l e d
up and chi'yoed out i n the right ones.

W i t h the f o r m a l i t i e s over,
the b a r soon assumed the

p l a c e f o r t h o u g h t f u l d i s c u s -

Other inexplicable and mysterious
events have occurred i n the top-floor
refectory. The rough concrete f l o o r was
f i t t e d with metal c l i p s to receive
wooden battens along whioh a s t r i p
f l o o r can be l a i d . Then a vast number
of wood blocks were delivered. There
followed a period of i n a c t i v i t y (during
which a l l enquiries received evasive
answers), and then the c l i p s f o r hold-
ing wood battens were covered with a
thick layer of cement on which wood
blocks can be l a i d . This layer of
cement i s at present drying out (a
process which takes about two weeks)
s» the opening of t h i s refectory i s
s t i l l longer delayed.
Almost every day something new
crops up. The v e n t i l a t i o n of the
kitchens, servery and wash-up was
completed during the vacation. At
f i r s t i t s effect was to produce a
howling draught (head-high) past
the unfortunate people working be-
hind the counter and i n the wash-
up. These two draughts met some-
where near the hot-plate i n the
kitchen. Hence cold food was com-
bined with indignant refectory s t a f f
suffering from headaches and pain3
in,the back. However, assurances have
been made that these are mere teething
troubles with the new system and that
a l l w i l l soon be w e l l . A serious
suggestion that wind eddies round the
Albert H a l l are responsible f o r d i r e c t -
ing a draught into the servery sky-
l i g h t has been laughed to scorn.
Bar conversation has l a t e l y been
more concerned with the i n t e r n a l de-
corations of rooms that are finished
rather than the general slowness.
Everyone has his own ideas on t h i s
sort of thing: a few hasty personal
impressions are that the concert h a l l
and dining h a l l are good, the lower
refectory i s awful, the armless chairs
in' the lounge are cheap and uncomfort-
able and the Bar i s excellent. The
opinions and ideas of the buildings'
users are invaluable and interesting.
So what do you think? A.K.

There i s some t a l k of the numerous
s e c r e t a r i a l colleges i n the v i c i n i t y
being oombined and given a status equi-
valent to ourselves - s h a l l we l i v e
to see the day when there w i l l be a
Royal College of Sees.?
Talking of i n h i b i t i o n s - car-
nivals are what you make 'em! And
there were f a r too many people who
arrived at the l a s t one as i f i t were
a supper-dance - the decor's p r e t t y
l u r i d , l e t ' s match i t with the costume.
And costume need not be involved or
time-absorbing - never has an " a l i c e
band" looked so redundant as on the
head of w e l l , guess?
The wind whispers that our de-
bating chairman of the S o c i a l Clubs
Committee i s becoming musical - heard
to say " l e t S.C.C. stand the l o s s ,
the Musical Society must have an
audience ..."
Why, oh why, can't people get
things right? The Conservative H.P.
i n l a s t term's debate on the Middle
Eastern policy c a l l e d us the Im-
p e r i a l I n s t i t u t e ; our r i v a l , "The
Times", repeated t h i s i n s u l t i n a
c r i t i q u e of "Loftur"; Brian Oggi -
the Imperial scribe - wrote to the
Radio Times to correct them on a
quiz game i n which they had mention-
ed Jezebel - and the printed l e t t e r
referred to the Guilds' mascot as Bob.
The blue F i a t belonging to Andy Levine
was featured i n the January issue of
Motor-Sport - and attributed to a
damned art student; Why, i n this year
of learning, 1956, can't they get
things write?
We are t o l d that sin"e the New

only black coffee i s sold i n the

At the time of going to press, we
have heard that the writer of the l e t -
