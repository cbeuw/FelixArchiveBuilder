Sonic found and sounded
Glyph McCord talks to the perpetrators of the 'Sonic for Pres'
campaign.
Revolutionaries or just sad
motherfuckas? The underground
phenomenon that is the 'Sonic for
New Election' campaign is
unearthed by Felix in an exclusive
encounter on the eve of the first day
of polling.
The Sonic posters have been
mysteriously appearing around the
college this week, to the annoyance
of the candidates, and generally
speaking, to the ignorance of Joe
Public.
So why bother ?
Why ? To ridicule the whole fiasco.
The sabbatical elections are simply
a self effacing group of people
seeking selfgratification, and afree
ride on the backs of the Union
members to a cheap year in the Bar
and thepick of thefirst year talent.
In that case, your motivation is
inflammatory, and ultimately
with the goal of toppling the
Union and causing widespread
panic around college ?
Naah! it was just a bit of a
laugh really, see, we went up to
Warwick University, and they've
got their elections on too, right.
One of their candidates - for
president or sommat - is such a
fuckin' spod, right, that he used a
picture of Sonic instead of himself
on all his posters. So we got to
thinkin' that ,OK , that'd be a
laugh, so when we got back, Sonic
came with us.
Ah ! so you're not so much
embryonic Che Guevaras, more
plagiarising, humourless Twats
with nothing better to do than
steal crap jokes from dour
midlands institutions like
Warwick, and paste them up over
the top of legitimate posters on
the walkway ?
Erm
OK, in that case, how can your
campaign be described as
anything other than 'Self
Effacing' and 'Self
Gratifying.'(sic) as you accuse the
legitimate candidates of being ?
Well it's sort of difficult to answer
that
Let's face facts boys, you really
didn't think about this very much
before hand did you ?
No not really.
Right, cheers then boys.
Fine, not exactly well planned or
executed, but a bit of a giggle, and
only £10 between three of them.
As to whether they are the ones
doing a spot of poster tearing down,
I doubt it. After all, one of them's
got a brother in the
Orb melowww.
