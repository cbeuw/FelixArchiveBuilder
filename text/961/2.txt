Editorial
To all the voters of Imperial
College, each one, and the
other one, thank you for
expressing your opinion. To all
the rest of you, you get exactly
what you deserve, you have
not even bothered to vote,
believing that it would make no
difference to the way you live
your lives, I have one message
for you. Put nothing in, get
nothing out.
The candidates have shown
all the small-mindedness of
children at play in a sweet shop,
even those who I personally felt
where good have behaved as if
winning an election was the
only thing that mattered . How
this pettiness qualifies them to
run a business that turns over
3.5 million I have no idea, but
then again I will not be around
to see what havoc they will
wreak!
My only thanks is to those of
the student media, who have
put almost as much time and
effort into covering this
campaign as the candidates
themselves. And finally to the
Print Unit Printer Andrew
Thompson for staying up so
late to get this issue out, thanks
again and Happy Birthday
(whenever it may be!)

A Slice of Life
Owam BennaJJacJc
Friday evening, and I arrive late
at the Main Dining Hall for the
International Night buffet. Already
the situation is pretty dire, empty
trays in the popular parts of the
world poigniantly summing up the
situation found in reality in others.
But it's 'the biggest social event of
the year', I'm not allowed to think
about how half this lots parents are
out to kill each other. Besides, in
the lucky position of Englishman,
I can smile serenely over the whole
messy business and be generally
superior.
Manor rushes over to me with
two food coupons in hand and
explains that he got them working
at the Italian stall. He shouts
'Lasagne' at me and drags me
across to part with my first token.
'Eh, you want some Lasagne?' says
an enthusiastic Greek guy, waving
his knife ferociously about my
head. 'Or some Spinach Lasagne?'
says Vivek, who's of Asian descent.
Manor, from Israel, rushes back to
his post. Not an Italian in sight. This
was just the kind of Cosmopolitan
shambles I'd hoped,for!
Whilst eating the spinach stuff I
notice Poddy drifting aimlessly
about. He looks tired, zombie like,
the election is clearly getting to him.
Or maybe its just those genes
coming into bloom. He tells me he's
canvassing for votes. But these
foreign types never vote?
'Precisely,' he says. 'So if I can get
their votes I'll have an unstoppable
groundswell of opinion behind me
and next year it'll be feet on desk
and cigar in hand.' (Or something
less libellous.)
Dave Goddard is up to the same
antics, a huge pile of 'vote Dave'
pamphlets hidden under a tourists
guide to Nicaragua. Now there's a
beguiling country. Their table is
harassed but it still has food. I
choose a cod dish, fitting in with my
current, 'don't eat it if it's got legs'
policy. Hey, Manor tells me that as
a non Jew all I have to do is make
sure whatever I dine on is dead. Just
no lunging at passing sheep, tongue
drooling, knife and fork in hand.
(Of course corning from Wales who
knows...) Then I notice the
vegetable accompaniment is
gorgeous, of course it has meat in
it, first I've eaten for eight months.
Micheal loans me a spare coupon
so it's gastronomic experience
three. By now I'm becoming wary
of 'food poisoning from around the
world', all the remaining food
looking decidedly dubious. But a
lovely Nigerian lady finds a whole
tray of some delicious stew , no
dead fluffy critters she promises.
Then it's time for the show.
The queue is ridiculous and it's
true that only the British know how
to do it properly. The rest of the
world is more interested in getting
on with the interesting part. So I
stand at the back, near the lifts,
while nearly everyone else
intersects from the stairs and gets
in before me. Luckily Paul and
Micheal have saved me a seat. The
atmosphere is excited, exhuberant.
The lights dim, thirty minutes late,
and someone switches on some
taped drums. The 'Flag Ceremony'
begins.
It's a good way to gauge the
racial mix in the audience, because
of course people can't resist
cheering loudest for their own
country. I go wild for everyone.
Each flag makes its way down to the
stage, lit by a giant spotiight. It's
quite impressive. The show begins.
Now I have to say the lighting
people failed to get it sorted on the
night. After the excellent start they
didn't seem to know what was
supposed to be on, off, in or out.
The hosts coped with this, and the
appalling jokes they'd been given to
read, pretty well. (Eg. After the
Spanish performance Zena had to
say 'One of them was a fireman.
His name was Hose'. She deserves
a medal for that.)
Act after act was flung onto the
stage and gave a nice postcard effect
of their country. Some were better
than others, nobody cared, we just
went mad for everyone. An Iranian
gentleman seemed almost moved to
tears by the fanatical adulation of
the crowd. Hell, you could have put
Idi Amin up there to discuss torture
techniques and they'd have gone
nuts.
And so there I was, banging my
feet up and down and cheering and
suddenly I realised something. I
might titter at the Greek display of
machismo and melodramatic plate
breaking but really I was just
jealous of their private party on the
stage. I might have found the near
delirium of the performers end of
show finale over the top, but these
people really knew how to have a
good time.
Where were the home students?
Certainly not in any of the rows
around me. I wondered what
performance the British would give
at the 'Hong Kong Institute of
Science and Technology'. Ironic
somehow, that we have 'Imperial'
in our title. Now the world has
come to us and many of us don't
seem to care. At once I felt very
lonely, the world seemed very big.
Everyone should be in a minority
sometime.
