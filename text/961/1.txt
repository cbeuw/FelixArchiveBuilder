Mary's block vote broken
In a history-creating move, Rebecca
Land has conquered the notorious
St Mary's Union 'block vote' to
become next year's Felix Editor.
In a vigorously fought contest,
the 174-strong Mary's 'block vote'
went to New Election. By
comparison, Miss Land received
the approval of only 17 Mary's
students. The third candidate, Ian
'Poddy' Davies, obtained the
remaining 15 Mary's votes. Despite
the 157 vote shortfall, Miss Land
was elected Felix Editor and Print
Unit Manager on the second ballot,
with 716 votes overall. Speaking to
Felix after the results were
announced, Miss Land could only
say, 'it is a dream come true'.
Before the results were
announced, M r Davies said he was
fairly confident, though very
nervous. Following the
announcement of the results, M r
Davies was obviously shaken,
although he did have the
composition to immediately
-congratulate Miss Land on her
victory. Commenting on the result
Mr Davies said, 'Fuck. Democracy
in action? If students voted for her
they deserve all they (don't) get'.
In the flagship election, Andrew
Wensley romped home with a
landslide victory over both Rachel
Mountford and New Election. M r
Wensley managed to secure the
Mary's vote. This was reflected in
his winning majority of 647 votes
over his nearest rival, Miss
Mountford. Though not present at
the announcement, Miss Mountford
was praised and thanked by M r
Wensley for a good campaign. She
seemed to have given up the
election after being subject to a
smear campaign by unidentified
sources early in the race.
A smaller landslide victory saw
David Goddard elected to the post
of Deputy President. After a 413
vote win over New Election and a
429 vote win over opposing
candidate Hugh Eland, M r Goddard
said, 'I am really pleased with the
landslide vote in my favour... the
vote demonstrates that I am
77ie winners: Andrew Wensley, President elect, Rebecca Land, Felix Editor and Print Unit Manager elect
and David Goddard, Deputy President elect
obviously the best person for the
job'. He commented that the result
may also have been due to him
knowing 'more people around
college'. Before the result was
announced M r Goddard said that he
expected the vote to be 'tight'.
Deputy President-elect Goddard
said that he had stuck to a
'straightforward' poster campaign,
and thought that M r Eland had gone
for 'clever' posters. M r Goddard
added that 'an intelligent campaign
is not a 'vote for me' campaign'.
In a repeat of last year's Honorary
Secretary election, the night',s
greatest upset was the defeat of Max
Jalil, who lost to New Election by
about 75 votes. Speaking to Felix
directly after receiving the result,
Mr Jalil said that he felt the St
Mary's block vote lost him the
election. He added that he will stand
again in the re-election if he feels
that the students of the South
Kensington campus want him to.
Mr Jalil, who said he was not too
depressed about losing, suggested
that the margin of defeat was not
such a large one.
The victory for New Election in
last year's elections led to a second
ballot in the third term, with a
completely new set of candidates
standing. The eventual winner and
this year's Hon Sec, Dominic
Wilkinson, said of this year's
campaign, 'the turnout was really
good and the campaigns were
good'. M r Wilkinson added that he
was 'disgusted' at the defacing of
posters. 'If ever I get hold of
him ', he added menacingly.
This year's turnout of almost
23% was marginally higher than
last year's 17% poll. The highest
turnout this year was for the
Presidential election, with 1353
members of Imperial College Union
marking their ballot papers
according to the STV electoral
system. This increase in turnout has
been ascribed to an increase in the
number of ballot boxes, and to the
strong editorial lines taken by Union
and Constituent College Union
media.
The results will come before a
Union General Meeting, to be held
at 1pm this Thursday in the Union
Concert Hall. It is widely expected
that this meeting will ratify the
elections of M r Wensley, M r
Goddard and Miss Land. Dominic
Wilkinson, Union Honorary
Secretary, will be instructed by the
meeting to rehold the Hon Sec
elections next term. The new
sabbaticals will take over at the start
of August 1993, following a one
month training period. Chris
Davidson, Imperial College Union
President, said, 'I am pleased for
the winners and look forward to the
candidates hand-over.'
