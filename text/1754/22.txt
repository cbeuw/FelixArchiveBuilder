SUSTAINABILITY
Shell loves to gaslight us
On the 2nd of October 2020, Shell
(that big energy company) tweeted
to its 550,000 followers, ‘What are you
willing to change to help reduce emis-
sions?’ with an attached poll for people
to choose between 1) Offset emissions
2) Stop flying 3) Buy electric vehicle 4)
Renewable electricity. This poll sparked
outrage on Twitter from environmental-
ists, scientists and activists alike, includ-
ing big-names Greta Thunberg, Alexan-
dria Ocasio-Cortez and the Rainforest
Action Network.
In an attempt to maintain their social
standing, Shell hid some of the replies
from the Twitter thread. One popular
response that was hidden by Shell was
from climate scientist Professor Kathar-
ine Hayhoe, ‘What am I willing to do?
Hold you accountable for 2% of cumu-
lative global GHG [greenhouse gas]
emissions.’
Shell has produced 1.7% of all green-
house gases emitted since 1988. This
percentage may seem small, but this is
just from one corporation. There are
many other corporations, just like Shell.
When we put these corporations togeth-
er, we get the horrifying statistic of 1/3
of all carbon dioxide emissions being
produced by only
20 companies.
In a fol-
low-up tweet,
Shell stated
that ‘Chang-
ing the energy
system requires
everyone to
play their part’,
trying to shift
the account-
ability onto
the consumers
and spread the
blame across
us all a whole
body. This is
pure manipula-
tion of the re-
ality that Shell
and other fossil fuel companies have cre-
ated over the past couple of decades.
Shellknewinthe1980sthattheburn-
ing of fossil fuels would lead to
globalwarming.In2018,a1988
confidentialShellreportwasun-
veiled. This report highlighted
the mechanism in which using
fossilfuelasenergywouldcreate
sea level rise, habitat losses, de-
struction of ecosystems and the
melting of the Antarctic. It also
highlighted how pursuing this
industry would cause changes
greater than ever recorded, and
I assume they would have been
able to predict the dispropor-
tionate effects on people living
in the Global South from such
changes. Yet, Shell still went
ahead and risked the health and
the environment all in the name
of profit and ‘development’.
The media have not ignored
their role in ecocide, but Shell
continues to greenwash (make
themselves appear more en-
vironmentally responsible by
sharing disinformation) their
mission. For example, Shell
claims that ‘they are part of the
solution to transitioning’ to
net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by
2050, while at the same time they refuse
to take responsibility for the harm that
they have caused across the globe.
According to a report
from Influence Map,
since 2015, the
corporations
Shell, Chevron,
ExxonMobil
and Total have
spent more than
$1 billion on
misleading cli-
mate messaging
and lobbying.
Furthermore,
this kind of ma-
nipulation is
not a new mar-
keting strategy;
it is something
integral for the
survival and
profitability of
their extractive business. In 2007 Shell
ran an ad declared misleading by the
Advertising Standards Authority, with
the slogan ‘We invest today’s profits in
tomorrow’s solutions’ for the advocat-
ing of their oil sands project in northern
Canada as a sustainable energy project.
Even worse, in 1991, Shell produced
a documentary called ‘Climate of con-
cern’ showing the effects of fossil fuels.
But at the same time Shell has been lob-
bying against global warming since the
early 90s.
Additionally, Shell claims that hu-
man rights are central to its business.
However, this is the same company that
turned the Niger Delta into a disaster
area, was complicit in the murder of
Ken Saro Wiwa, and polluted Curaçao’s
waters. Amnesty International is calling
for Shell to be held accountable for their
crimes.
AllofthisgoestoshowhowShellcan-
not greenwash on Twitter and get away
with it. We do have power in holding
big oil companies accountable, and we
should continue to use it. Shell cannot
be trusted as a responsible corporation
when it consistently opposes account-
ability and believing than ‘Profits and
Principles’ can go hand in hand.
This is an important topic of concern
forallImperialstudentsconsideringthat
Imperial invests in Shell and has a valued
relationship with them.

I have recently started reading the
third issue of Shado [See. Hear. Act.
Do.] magazine, and I love the varia-
tion of essays on climate justice, racial
justice and social justice. It isn’t just a
magazine though. It is a self-described
multimedia platform driving change
at the intersection of arts, activism and
academia.
The publication is accessible read-
ing for everyone and spotlights people
who are not usually shined upon is the
traditional media. It is a fusion of stun-
ning contemporary art and writings
by a wide variation of people from all
over the world. The themes covered in
the latest issue range from Indigenous
Philosophy in contemporary climate
activism to dismantling capitalist sys-
tems in the climate crisis. The previous
issue centres the topic of Global Wom-
xnhood, and it also on my reading list.
If you are interested in climate jus-
tice, if you care about climate action,
or if you want to learn more about the
effects of climate change, I thoroughly
recommend reading this. Shado share
content on their Instagram @shado.
mag and articles on their website, www.

the magazine (in print or PDF form).
