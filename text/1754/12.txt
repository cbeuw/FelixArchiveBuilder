As Felix has changed its release cycle to
‘random’, Hangman has this week de-
cided to take matters into its own paws and
predict the events taking place
during the week we think this
issue will eventually be re-
leased. Without further ado,
this is what we think might
have happened this week:
Nevada decides to secede
from the Union, rather than
finish counting the untallied
ballots. Don Jackals, a spokes-
person for the electoral com-
mittee, stated “There’s just so
many. Like a lot more than we
expected. It’s just easier this way.”
The Queen celebrates her 98th Diamond
Jubilee. Prince Phillip observed to be “malting
more than usual” in run up to his annual sacri-
ficial consumption of Phillip Schofield.
COVID is revealed to be ‘DIVOC’ back-
wards. Experts ask, “is there any way we can
maybe do something with this?”
FansaredismayedtolearnthatthenewFast
and Furious film ‘Too Fast, Not
Enough Furious’ production
has been delayed due to is-
sues with Paul Walker hol-
ogram technology. In other
news, Paul Walker presented
with posthumous award for
‘Best Dead Actor’.
Keir Starmer somehow
turns governments an-
nouncement of ‘Tier 10
Lockdown’ into an anti-sem-
itism row.
Finally, the UK raises its terror threat level
to ‘In progress’.
So there’s our predictions. For extra points,
make these headlines happen yourself!
