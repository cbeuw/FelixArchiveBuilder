SUSTAINABILITY
Take part in a climate change initiative
“Cities are our homes. Cities need
their citizens as much as citizens
need their cities. The only way forward
is together. With over 100 Climathons
happening on six continents,
thousands of people are taking
actions across cultures and
countries. As our community of
citizens, governments, and busi-
nesses grows, we see that local
climate action is truly trans-
formative. People like you are
giving rise to a wave of change,
a wave of creativity, and a wave
of hope. Hope that is fiercely
rooted in actions.”
This quotation is from the
Climathon 2019 Promo Video.
Buzz words pump the adrena-
line, make me feel excited about
this mission. We are taking a
global and urgent problem and
trying to solve it from the ground up
with everyone’s contribution. Yes, every-
one plays a part in this, including an un-
dergraduate student living in a foreign
country like myself, or a Felix reader like
yourself.
Ibelieveinthepowerofcollaboration
and providing people with the platform
to do so.
In 2019, a couple of undergrad stu-
dents and I came together and organ-
ised two impact-focused Hackathons
to encourage students to tackle social
issues, fuelled by the belief that Imperi-
al students have the skills to do good in
this world. We invited mentors, organ-
ised workshops, and supported social
ventures for international competitions.
Transitioning the knowledge about set-
ting up hackathons into a Climathon
was a very welcomed challenge that fit
like a glove.
We knew that organising such an
event has its challenges: How do we cre-
ate a way for ideas and projects to con-
tinueaftertheevent?Howcanweensure
diversity so that the climate discussions
are not an echo
chamber between the same group of
people? How can we engage different
stakeholders when their priorities were
not this during the Covid pandemic?
These were the questions we had to ad-
dress since the preparation started in
April.
Seven months later and countless
overrun meetings, three main things
were in place. Firstly, a strong organising
team with passionate students and pro-
fessionals from Imperial College, Im-
pact Hub, and Terra Institute. Secondly,
local problem statements set by local
councils and social enterprises
who understand the pain the
best. These partnerships will en-
able participants to brainstorm
solutions for real problems, with
the possibility of continuing the
project post-Climathon. Lastly,
thanks to Covid, we could cut
on catering costs and eliminate
the frustration of sorting pizza
delivery logistics.
And here we are now, count-
ing down to the event. So… why
don’t you join us on the week-
end of 13th to the 15th of No-
vember? Meet some cool people,
solve some problems, and play
your part in the climate initiative!
Problem themes: Sustainable Living,
Food System, Urban Development, and
Supply chain.

Why is climate change a social justice issue?
This topic isn’t news to anyone in-
terested in worldwide justice issues,
but this question seems to get on the
nerves of climate change deniers, so I
feel like we should address it.
When we conceptualise the climate
crisis in the Global North, we primar-
ily see the effects of climate change as
environmental. Still, since we, the peo-
ple, and the environment are inextrica-
bly connected, the impacts of climate
change are also social and economic.
More frequent extreme weather events
and climate changes affect the local ag-
ricultural production, safe water access,
productivity, and end up forcing people
to migrate to other regions and some-
times other countries.
The consequences of climate change,
suchasflooding,risingsealevel,drought
and increased temperature, are dispro-
portionately affecting low-income coun-
tries and poor people in high-income
countries. People who can move away
from at-risk areas are already moving,
but those who cannot afford too are left
but eventually
are forced to
move and can
be put into an
unstable liv-
ing situation.
By the end of
the century,
we expect that
more than
180 million
people will
be displaced
due to climate
change.
F u r t h e r -
more, the climate crisis will dispropor-
tionately affect people of colour, as more
people of colour live in areas vulnerable
toenvironmentaldegradation(asaresult
of climate change). This is in addition to
the effects of environmental racism from
polluting systems and corporations.
So, what can we do? We can reject
this destruction of the planet as the
norm. The status quo serves to displace
people and creates significant uncertain-
ties already in countries in the Global
South. We in the Global North haven’t
felt the same level of effects as the south,
but we continue to uphold the systems
of oppression that create the problems.
Support climate justice now by joining
your local community action group. No
movement or community network is
too small.
Some examples of climate actions
that you can take are: Switching to re-
newable energy, improving the energy
efficiency of your house, swap to a cli-
mate-friendly bank, eating a plant-rich
diet and reducing food waste.
