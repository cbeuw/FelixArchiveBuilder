In this week’s issue, we take a closer
look at how major stock indexes have
been affected worldwide due to a variety
of drivers, in particular with what is go-
ing on in the European and US markets
but we also have an opinion on Chinese
indexes following suspension of the
Ant Group IPO, due to have been the
record-breaking IPO with $37 billion
USD raised from institutional investors.
Here is a look at technology in global
markets through the lens of stock indi-
ces.
Europe
As for some recent especially recent
news, STOXX Europe 600 (a European
stock index) fell almost 6% this week.
This pushed the index to its lowest point
since May this year. We can likely attrib-
ute this to the fact that investors reacted
to the further lockdown measures being
announced due to the second wave of
COVID-19 in countries like Spain and
Italy, and now also the England national
lockdown, as well as the upcoming pres-
idential election.
The negative impact to European
markets was especially prominent in the
software giant’s, SAP SE’s, 20% drop in
share price last week. This cloud based
business operations company saw a far
worse-than-expected
third-quarter earn-
ings update. Its shift
from license software
(with a one-time up-
front payment) to
the more typical sub-
scription based cloud
infrastructure means
that profits will flow
in less quickly. Furthermore, the Ger-
man company said “Lockdowns have
been reintroduced in some regions,
recovery is uneven and companies are
facing more business uncertainty.” Its
mid-sized (businesses) clients were, as a
result of COVID-19, moving towards
cloud causing a need to improve on
their services. Christian Klein, one of
the two new CEOs of the firm, said “We
will speed up the modernisation of our
cloud delivery infrastructure,
this will require additional in-
vestments in 2021 and 2022,
but it sets us up for a cloud cost
margin of approximately 80
percent by 2025.” This added
investment into the software
combined with the reduced
revenues shot down SAP’s
share price. However, Jefferies
analysts say that the subscrip-
tion services could make up to
85% of turnover by 2025; so it’s
not all doom and gloom!
The reason we dive into SAP SE is that
it is Europe’s largest software company,
and the STOXX Europe 600 Technol-
ogy Index (an analog of NASDAQ for
Europe) fell 10.5% over the past week.
Looking at the companies and contrib-
utors of a stock index can help us more
easily understand the movements of the
index itself as these trends can often ap-
ply to similar companies.
US
Again looking at technology, the US-
based tech heavy NASDAQ index was
down 5.5% this week despite the big
tech companies doing well after reveal-
ing their Q3 earnings reports. As I men-
tioned above, it is important to look at
the actual companies which contribute
to a stock index; 49% of the NASDAQ
100 is governed
by Apple, Mi-
crosoft, Ama-
zon, Facebook,
Alphabet (AKA
Google), and
Tesla. These
companies have
been through a
lot over the past
2 weeks, from growing pains related to
the pandemic, to antitrust issues, the
Section 230 hearing and electoral poli-
tics. Despite this, they are booming due
to the rising market for online advertis-
ing and the obvious increase in screen
time. “All of these companies have just
returned an absolute killer of a quarter,”
said Youssef Squali, an internet analyst
at Truist. “The recovery curve is just a lot
sharper than any of us expected. Online
is taking a tonne of market share from
offline.”
The contentious hearing on Wednesday
was truly a roller coaster. Roger Wicker,
a Republican senator, opened the hear-
ing by accusing Twitter and the other
platforms of “selective censorship...in
the midst of the 2020 election cycle”.

This is because a New York Post tweet
wastakendownasitlookedlikeahacked
tweet. On the other hand, Tammy Bald-
win, Wisconsin Democrat senator, said
“I believe the Republicans have called
this hearing in order to support a false
narrative fabricated by the president to
help his re-election prospects, the tech
companies here today need to take more
action, not less.” Outside of political de-
bate, the hearing served as an evaluation
of Section 230 of the 1996 Communica-
tions Decency Act, a law that gives tech
platforms immunity from being sued
over user-generated content. Speaking
to Section 230, Mark Zuckerberg called
on Congress to “update the law to make
sure it’s working as intended”. On the
other hand Jack Dorsey said that erod-
ing the foundation of Section 230 could
collapse how we communicate on the
internet, leaving only a small number
of giant and well-funded technology
companies.” This would be a terrible sit-
uation for tech companies worldwide if
not dealt with carefully. Furthermore,
the hearing could result in additional
pressure on companies to more careful-
ly censor political ads which could have
an impact on the election. However, the
latest polling average puts Biden ahead
of Trrrrrrrrump nationally but again this
does not guarantee a Democrat victory.
