ery few people seem to remember this title,
which I find profoundly bizarre given it
earned PlayStation Platinum status. A child’s
edition of Grand Theft Auto, being able to run amok
in Springfield with Homer Simpson, Bart Simpson
and other legendary characters of the show at the
wheel made the game a lifelong child memory. Many
hours were spent completing challenges as part of the
extraterrestrial storyline, but the arcade nature and
relatively sophisticated graphics for a PS2 title in 2003
of all years takes me back to my first foray into the
utopia of video gaming.
... In FIFA, it’s much the same.
Gamers want the best football
players on their team, whether
that be Ronaldo, Neymar, Messi
or Ben Yedder. The chance of
such outcomes are so slim, you’d
probably stand more chance of
winning the lottery (but please
don’t quote me as fact, it’s just
hyperbole). The fact is, gamers
spend hundreds, if not thousands
on attaining such bespoke and
highly lucrative items (which to
make things worse expire at the end
of September of the next calendar
year after release). An accountant
would say you would be mad to
make such a foolish expense on
such a short term asset. This isn’t
a game, this is pseudo-gambling
addiction the way I see it.
A video game that requires a
larger expenditure than simply
purchasing the disc itself is not
a game but more of a gambling
machine. Spend £55 on release day
for FIFA and you’d still need to
spend more than £50 per month on
average just to attempt (not even
guarantee) to get the best players in
the game for your squad. It’s purely
gambling and although other
people might stand differently to
the view I’ve delivered so far, it is
not sustainable for a 13-year-old to
empty more of his account just to
earn players that would last him the
best part of 12 months.
Again, a video game should be
about having fun at no more of
an expense than purchasing the
title itself. If you pay £50 for the
new edition then that’s all you
should pay to enjoy the experience
like everyone else. Take Infinity
Ward’s Modern Warfare and
Warzone as an example: all the
guns are accessible, some from the
start and others are unlockable by
completing in-game challenges.
The only purchases that you are
free to make are purely cosmetic
e.g. new soldier skins, bullet tracers
that shoot bullets with rainbow
colours or camos for cars. Even
if you purchase the battle pass,
which for those unfamiliar is like a
Tesco Clubcard that offers rewards
based on how much you play (or
in Tesco’s case, pay) you still earn
enough points to purchase the next
battle pass, so in essence it’s a one
off purchase for a lifetime of free
cosmetic assets.
When parliament demanded EA
to explain why loot-box mechanics
were prevalent in FIFA, vice-
president Kerry Hopkins described
them as “surprise mechanics” akin
to “Kinder Eggs”. That simply is a
flawed argument at best — you’re
guaranteed chocolate and a toy
in Kinder Eggs, but in FIFA it’s
not even a certainty whether the
chocolate will be rewarded to you.
Overall, EA has adopted a
pay-to-win structure, and it’s killing
the fun out of a gaming series well
embedded in modern culture. Pro
clubs, which is a game mode where
friends play together against other
teams, has simply been disbanded
and only refined once in the past
5 iterations. A gamemode where
there isn’t a pay-to-win structure
is simply left to rot with countless
bugs and glitches while EA are
catering to Ultimate team in
conjunction with the eSports
scene, where obscene fees are paid
to obtain the best items in their
Ultimate Team squad. Professional
eSports athletes fight it out with
the very best items in the game,
even after expenditures upwards
of £10,000 simply to start off
with. When I started FIFA 21 the
other week, I was running with a
3 star team, whereas my opponent
already spent enough money
in 24 hours to obtain Ronaldo,
Messi and icon Del Piero. Game
publishers and eSports deserves
its own discussion since there’s
too much to discuss regarding the
matter in simply one article.
FIFA needs to change. Their
monopoly on the game allows them
to get away with such pseudo-
casino-esque practices. Whilst
online names such as Kurt0411
are trying to raise their voices on
the matter, EA take the short road
and simply ban their accounts
on mention of the matters that
they’re being required to answer.
The game is encouraging gambling,
and without intervention, the
problem will get much bigger until
livelihoods are ruined.
After the time of writing, it was
reported that EA was fined up to
€10 million by the Netherlands
Gaming Authority (KSA) for failing
to “heed the KSA’s call” to adapt
their games by removing gambling
elements in their titles.

Lockdown meant that FIFA 20 was one of the top
sellers, and EA had an opportunity here to fix the
bugs and requests of die-hard players in the FIFA
community. Manual defending yields the opportunity
to defeat the 10-year-old wallet warrior by playing
attractive football without the AI-defending to rescue,
but the lack of any real fixes to the bugs mean the
game just isn’t worth the time or money it’s asking for.
The Haunting comes
to haunt Verdansk
Warzone S6 Special

Warzone grew to being an entertaining game, even
more so with friends during late evenings. The season
6 special introduces a halloween-themed Haunting
edition of Verdansk, where soldiers are killed and
revive as zombies to scare and kill remaining players.
With friends, the jumpscares can be immensely
enjoyable, but playing the solo mode is akin to a
horror show - one wrong turn and you’re either
getting mauled by a disfigured zombie or sniped from
distance, rendering you dead. Infinity Ward allegedly
also confirmed that the current gaming engine will
exist for Season 7 when Black Ops Cold War is out.
