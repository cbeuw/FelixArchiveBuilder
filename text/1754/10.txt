I feel something of a fool. My
editorial, published last
week on the 30th
Octo-
ber was titled ‘Half way
through term, things
are looking up’. That
shows what I know
and the foolishness
of making off the cuff
predictions. Instead we
as a student body see our-
selves once again thrown back into
a tighter lockdown as if the interven-
ing months between March and now
meant nothing at all.
Students have a right to be frustrated.
They were lured back into halls with
promises of ‘mixed-mode’ teaching
that would keep them safe and able to
attend face to face teaching but have
instead been blamed in the nation-
al press for causing Covid spikes
through careless disregard for the
rules and been locked up in rooms
to stew. (Though student areas have
been shown to have higher Covid
rates by The Times, a causation has
not been established).
Luckily students around the coun-
try are putting up resistance to their
treatment. Reported in News this
week Felix covers protests in both
Manchester and Bristol against
lockdown restrictions and the Bris-
tol university ‘Cut the Rent’
campaign that aims to
make the university
allow students to end
contracts early and the
reduction of rents in
acknowledgement of
the reduced facilities
available to halls res-
idents. We here at Felix
strongly support efforts by
University of Bristol and University
of Manchester students to demand
a reduction in fees to a level that is
commensurate with the service pro-
vided.
We also call on the Union to advocate
on the behalf of students. While the
College has postponned planned rent
increases until next year in response
to the Covid-19 pandemic they have
shown no inclination to reduce fees
this year. This is unacceptable and we
will keep calling for reductions for
students in halls.
With Interim Vice-Provost (Educa-
tion) Emma McCoy calling mixed
mode teaching equivalent in value to
face to face teaching when Felix spoke
to her and Provost Ian Walmsley at
the beginning of term, it will be dif-
ficult for the College to keep up this
argument when students are locked
up.

Premature celebration and
an end to unfair rent
The Felix Editor on
No journalism please, we’re scientists
Watching the US election over the
last couple of days I have been struck
time and time again how poorly poll-
ing and probabilaty predictions have
been interpreted. With the arrival of
Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight and the
widespread adoption of quantitative
poll aggregation techniques, it had
appeared to me that the commentar-
iat had learned how to read polling
data. Yet, time and time again I was
struck by how badly pundits on both
British and US media interpreted the
90 and 97% probability of a Biden vic-
tory given by FiveThirtyEight and the
New York Times. A 90% probability
means only that 9 times out of 10 the
election will fall one way. It makes no
prediction on the type or strength of
thatvictory.Whileitisclearthatthere
has been institutional error in polling
data, the misapplicaiton of probablity
was what struck me the most.
Wanted!
People that understand probablity
to enter into journalism and political
coverageto presentclearlywhata90%
probability means and how to inter-
pret that. We here at Felix can’t stand
another night of coverage like that.

Statement
of Intent
We here at Felix believe that it is al-
ways in the interests of the students to
know. That cover-up and paternalistic
obfuscation is never right and that
as intelligent people students should
be treated with respect and given the
ability to make up their own minds.
Therefore, I, the Felix Editor, on be-
half of the team promise that:
We will to the best of our abil-
ity tell you the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
We will keep your confidence
and will only publish something
you say to us if you have explicitly
said that we can.
We will work to expose unfair-
ness and discrimination in all
forms that it takes both at the
College and elsewhere.
We will treat fairly any article
sent to us, regardless of point
of view and do our best to work
with you to prepare it for publi-
cation it in our pages.
