The UK’s latest £55m nuclear
fusion experiment switched on
last Thursday (October 29th) after a
seven-year build.
Located at the Culham Centre for
Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire, the
Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak
(MAST) Upgrade is a successor exper-
iment to the original MAST, which
operated from 1999 to 2013.
What makes MAST Upgrade
unusual is its shape; while more well-
known fusion experiments such as
France’s ITER are tokamaks based on a
torus (essentially, a doughnut), MAST
Upgrade is a spherical tokamak, which
has a shape more akin to a cored apple.
Both designs operate on the same
principle: confine a super-hot hydro-
gen plasma in the shape of a torus
using strong magnetic fields, sustain-
ing a steady rate of fusion reactions.
However, the ‘cored apple’ shape of
the spherical tokamak is expected
to give multiple advantages over the
torus shape of the traditional tokamak,
namely mak-
ing it more
compact and
able to use
magnetic
fields more
efficiently.
The MAST
Upgrade
experiment
aims to shed
new light on
the practical-
ity of the spherical tokamak design for
compact power plants.
MAST Upgrade is also the first
fusion reactor to make use of the ‘Su-
per-X divertor’, which is a system that
aims to expel spent plasma by cooling
it more than commonly used exhaust
systems. With cooler material going
through the divertor, materials used
on divertor surfaces should be able to
last longer before needing replacement.
The Culham Centre for Fusion Energy
believe that this system, if shown to
work successfully, will be a key design
for commercial fusion reactors.
In a Government press release,
Science Minister Amanda Solloway
looked forward to the future: “We
want the UK to be a world leader in
fusion energy and to capitalise on its
amazing potential as a clean energy
source that could last for hundreds of
years. Backed by £55 million of gov-
ernment funding... [MAST Upgrade]
takes us another step closer towards
our goal of building the
UK’s first fusion power
plant by 2040.”
However, the Govern-
ment’s commitment to
the UK being a world
leader in fusion remains
in doubt. Despite calls
from scientists for the
UK to remain part of the
European Atomic Energy
Community (Euratom),
the UK has not yet re-
solved this in the ongoing
Brexit negotiations and is
thus not currently party
to the ITER programme,
which aims to construct
the world’s largest tokam-
ak and demonstrate that
fusion is indeed a viable
energy source.

What is nuclear
fusion?
Nuclear fusion is a promising
energy source for the future. Where
nuclear fission splits heavy atoms in
a chain reaction, fusion joins light
atoms together. Both these pro-
cesses release energy despite being
opposites to one another: this is
due to a quantity called the bind-
ing energy per nucleon. A graph of
this quantity against atomic mass
can be seen in Figure 1. This curve
shows that it is energetically favour-
able for lighter elements to fuse
to become heavier elements, and
for very heavy elements to split to
become lighter elements.
This is a powerful graph; not
only does it show us that fusion re-
leases a lot more energy than fission
for the same mass of fuel, it also
shows that iron is in a sense the
most stable nucleus; it is not ener-
getically favourable for it to split
or fuse. This is why stars can only
make elements up to and including
iron.
Fusion requires two nuclei to
overcome their electrostatic repul-
sion by getting close enough so
that the strong force kicks in. This
initial repulsion is strong; stars
manage to get hydrogen nuclei
close due to immense pressure and
temperatures at their centres thanks
to gravity, however these condi-
tions are difficult to replicate on
Earth without huge inefficiencies.
Due to these inefficiencies, fusion
experiments currently take in more
energy than they give back. In
order for fusion energy to become
a practical source of clean and safe
power, these inefficiencies must be
reduced.
