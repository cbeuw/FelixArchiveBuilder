Europe is not particularly well known
for its tech companies, with the entire
industry being valued at less than half
of Apple alone. Local companies have
stagnated or been acquired, leading to
this side of the Atlantic having an almost
complete dependence on the US for
some of the most important things in
modern society. There is one exception
to this trend, however – ARM. ARM as
a company is not very well known to the
public but is hugely influential in daily
life. With over 180 billion processors
based on its designs shipped – including
in almost every smartphone ever made
– it may be the technology we interact
with most. The company operates on a
different model to most others; instead
of selling its own products, ARM devel-
ops intellectual property which it licens-
es to others, receiving a small royalty on
every product shipped that uses its tech-
nology.
This business model has become the
driver behind
its massive
s u c c e s s .
Known as
the “Swit-
zerland of
the semi-
conductor
industry”,
A R M ’ s
willingness
to license
its IP to
anyone and
ever yone
has meant
companies
have been
confident
enough to spend billions on R&D un-
derpinning their businesses with ARM
technology – with Apple, for example,
moving all of its products to ARM based
designs in the coming years. This neu-
trality is something that is threatened by
the proposed $40 billion acquisition of
ARM by Nvidia, a company best known
for its GPUs. This proposal, in my opin-
ion, is not only detrimental to ARM,
but also to the European tech industry
and possibly even national security.
To be clear, ARM has not technically
been independent in recent times - af-
ter a $32 billion acquisition by Japanese
conglomerate Softbank in 2016, the
company was removed from the LSE
and NASDAQ. Despite Nvidia offering
the same promises as Softbank made in
its deal – such as keeping the company
headquarters in the UK, with the UK’s
most powerful supercomputer thrown
in as a sweetener – there are some key
differences between the two companies.
Softbank, despite its massive $100
billion “Vision Fund” for investing in
technology, is not a player in the semi-
conductor industry, meaning it is in its
best interests to make ARM as open to
licensing as possible. Nvidia, on the oth-
er hand, operates in the same markets
as many of the companies that license
ARM technologies, such as Samsung
and AMD. Nvidia could very easily re-
strict what licensees could do
with their future ARM based
products, raising prices and
stifling innovation – and
with a reputation for an-
ti-competitive behaviour,
this is not inconceivable.
Without any legally bind-
ingguarantees,Nvidia’s
promises that it will
do the right thing are
meaningless.
The second issue
with Nvidia taking
ownership of ARM
is the fact that it is head-
quartered in the USA. The
Trump Administration has
increasingly embraced pro-
tectionism,placingsomeforeigncompa-
nies, such as Huawei, on what is known
as the Entity List. Whether these sanc-
tions are justified or not is beyond the
scope of this article – what this means,
however, is that all US-based companies
are barred from trading with the mem-
bers of the Entity List. The restrictions
do not stop there; any foreign compa-
nies are also barred from trading with
the companies
on the Entity
List if they
utilise any
technology
of US origin
– however
little – in
their prod-
ucts. Being
a UK-based
c o m p a n y,
ARM is im-
mune to this
legislation,
allowing it
to continue
to trade with whoever it wishes to. This
is a very powerful ability to have – im-
munity from US sanctions is something
countries spend billions developing, for
example through Russia, China, and the
EU’s independent satellite navigation
systems. Throwing away this influence is
a clear detriment to national security.
Softbank is not selling because it wants
to – it is selling because it needs to.
Through some bad investments such as
WeWork and
the impact
of the
coronavirus
pandemic, the
conglomerate
is in desperate
need of cash,
and as such is
selling off one of
its jewels in a last-ditch attempt
for some liquidity. One avenue to be
pursued – favoured by ARM cofounder
Dr Hermann Hauser – is for ARM to go
public again, with the possibility of the
UK Government taking a stake in the
company.AlthoughtheGovernmenthas
shown an appetite for such
deals recently – investing
$500 million for a stake
in satellite communica-
tions company OneWeb
– the technological illit-
eracy of our politicians
means the importance
of ARM is probably go-
ing to fly right over their
heads, instead viewing
the deal as another pawn
in the post Brexit trade
deal negotiations. Other
options are likely to be
equally as problematic
as the one proposed by
Nvidia – the kind of organisations with
this kind of money tend to be American
tech companies or state backed invest-
mentfunds.Thefinal,mostlikelyoption
is for the acquisition to be approved,
with regulators negotiating legally bind-
ing agreements to get around some of
the issues with the deal. Unfortunate-
ly, it looks as if we will see yet another
promising European technology com-
pany swallowed up for a
fraction of its potential
value.
