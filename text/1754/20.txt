This is because a New York Post
tweet was taken down as it looked
like a hacked tweet. On the other hand,
Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrat
senator, said “I believe the Republi-
cans have called this hearing in order
to support a false narrative fabricated
by the president to help his re-elec-
tion prospects, the tech companies
here today need to take more action,
not less.” Outside of political debate,
the hearing served as an evaluation of
Section 230 of the 1996 Communica-
tions Decency Act, a law that gives tech
platforms immunity from being sued
over user-generated content. Speaking
to Section 230, Mark Zuckerberg called
on Congress to “update the law to make
sure it’s working as intended”. On the
other hand Jack Dorsey said that erod-
ing the foundation of Section 230 could
collapse how we communicate on the
internet, leaving only a small number
of giant and well-funded technology
companies.”
This would be a terrible situation for
tech companies worldwide if not dealt
with carefully. Furthermore, the hearing
could result in additional pressure on
companies to more carefully censor po-
litical ads which could have an impact
on the election. However, the latest
polling average puts Biden ahead of
Trump nationally but again this does
not guarantee a Democrat victory.
At the same time, the Department
of Justice received bipartisan political
support in filing an antitrust suit against
Google (and similar things are happen-
ing in the EU). Google was accused of
anti-competitive practices. Ironically
after the news hit, shares of Google’s
parent company Alphabet Inc. climbed
1.4%.
Why did this happen? Firstly, the law-
suit was already expected by investors
and it was ‘priced in’ to the share price.
There is also speculation that the law-
suit won’t hurt Google’s revenues from
its leadership in search advertising.
Mark Shmulik, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein, told investors on Tues-
day that the firm sees “limited risk” to
Google from the suit. However, it could
also end much worse for Google if it
gets split up into separate, smaller com-
panies such as Maps, Search, Youtube,
Android OS and
Chrome.
In conclusion,
these are truly
volatile times
and especially
for tech stocks
which are re-
nowned for their
high beta values
(standard devi-
ation from the
mean share price), and this can be seen
also in VIX (Chicago Board Options
Exchange’s CBOE Volatility Index
(this reflects stock market’s expectation
of volatility based on S&P 500 index
options)) reaching high
values of almost 40. The
aforementioned fall in
NASDAQ could be due
to the worse-than-ex-
pected earnings released
by many companies. Be
sure to keep following the
markets closely through
the remainder of the
election period, as very
interesting things will
undoubtedly happen.
Major stock indexes play a huge
role in investment as we saw with Ant
Group’s suspended IPO earlier this
week, with so much demand among
institutional investors as Chinese
investors saw them as a must-have. Had
the IPO not been suspended follow-
ing a call from Chinese regulators, the
stock price would have shot up further
following public trading on the indexes.
Even on Wednesday, a few days after
this was originally written the extreme
volatility with the election pushed tech
stocks in NASDAQ up by 4%. Howev-
er, option prices for VIX indicate that
investors are pricing in less volatility for
after the US presidential election.
More on US market indexes
A market index effectively
follows the performance
of a basket of stocks, using
a collection of numbers
which are representative
of different components’
weighted values.
Here, the kinds of compo-
nents can consist of shares,
commodities and bonds.
However, investors often
follow different market
indexes to track market
movements due to the fact
that market index numbers
are able to indicate the
rates of both GDP growth
and inflation.
Major market indexes that
investors are familiar with
include the Dow Jones,
Industrial Average, NYSE
Composite Index, Finan-
cial Times Stock Exchange
Index and Nikkei Stock
Average.
Market indexes are used
by investors as a basis for
portfolio or passive index
investing, in that they are
treated as benchmarks
so then alpha returns can
be tracked relatively to
show profits or deficits.
Constructing individual
indexes would depend
on the relevant party yet
most fund managers utilise
weighted average mathe-
matics via several constitu-
ents. In recent times, many
sustainable investments
funds employing ESG
(environmental, social and
governance) factors have
made the shift to track
more environmentally
friendly indexes such as
the MSCI (Morgan Stan-
ley Capital International)
ESG indexes.
I’m too embarassed to ask - what is a market index?

Fear and volatility in US market indexes have rose steeply with the anticipation for US election results.
