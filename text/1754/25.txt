Following on from the interviews
we have had with
imperial athlete, we
present the follow-
ing interview we had
withtheBNOCthat
is Zhengli Lim, aka
‘Ribbon Guy’. I am
quite lucky to have
known him from
the beginning of my
time here at univer-
sity. I, along with
many mechanical
engineering students
in the years directly
above and below me, owe a significant
part of our degree success to this man.
He spends uncountably numerous hours
dedicated to running tutorials, creating
tutorial sheet solutions and answering
questions from students. On top of this
hehasalsoDJ’edatmajorLondonclubs,
extensively fundraised for charities and
put a smile onto the face of many of us
who see him roller blade into university.
I share this information so that you can
fully grasp the nature of Zhengli and the
love that is felt towards him in the Me-
chanical Engineering Department and
throughout the university.
Who are you?
Originally from Malaysia, I accepted
an offer to move to a Singapore at the
age of 12 for my studies. I went alone,
and while it was difficult being away
from family at first, I soon grew to en-
joy the freedom to
live independent-
ly. I didn’t do
any competitive
sports, but I did
have a lot of en-
ergy which I ex-
pended by run-
ning up and down
the stairs between
classes.
What’s your
university aca-
demic background?
I did my undergrad here in Mechan-
ical with Nuclear Engineering which I
quite enjoyed. It was tough, and I kept a
record of study notes that I shared with
my friends who were also struggling at
the time. Together we created an inde-
pendent group called Mechnet which
encourages a culture of collaboration
between students so we can get through
the degree, to great success! I have cho-
sen to stay on as a PhD student in the
same department and I’m now in my
second year, studying Thermoacoustics.
What’s your sport background?
I don’t have a background in compet-
itive sports. However, I am naturally at-
tuned for endurance activities due to my
low weight and do random sports for
the fun of it. I used to run cross-country
when I was very young, and then tried
out gymnastics, swimming, ice skating,
roller blading, skiing, cycling, football,
badminton, table tennis and climbing. I
wanted to try out multiple activities to
see if there was one that I could stick to.
I guess I found mine!
How did you come across the idea
of starting ribbon?
A part of my personality is chaotic en-
ergy, so I’m not joking when I say that
I stumbled upon it randomly because I
thought it would be funny to try. Last
November, my latest hobby was dancing
to electronic music. Then the idea came
to me that in-
stead of just
p u n c h i n g
the air with
my bare fists
I could also
hold a rib-
bon at the
same time.
My activity
is an odd fu-
sion which
draws from
the elements
of Rhythmic
Gymnastics, Dance, DJ and Martial
Arts (see ‘chaotic energy’ above). I don’t
follow any instructions on this; I do ex-
actly what I feel like doing at any given
time. When you make an activity your
own, the only standards to adhere to are
yours!!
How do you get the confidence to
do what you do in front of strangers
and some people you do know?
Confidence doesn’t really drive me;
gratitude does. Truth is, I almost didn’t
get my PhD offer and I wouldn’t be
here in London right now. I thorough-
ly enjoyed my undergrad here and all
the friends I made in this city. So much
that I was visibly shaken when people I
knew were getting their offers and I was
resigned to the idea that I wouldn’t be
staying here any longer. But a mere two
days before I had to leave the country,
the offer came!! I was so happy I ran out
and started dancing on the street and
clearly haven’t stopped. I guess it’s only
when one faces the real threat of losing
what they have that they understand
what truly matters and what ultimately
doesn’t.
How has COVID affected your
life?
I intentionally refused to return home
for the summer even though my family
requested me to (since London’s cases
were rising exponentially at the time).
This was for their own good, and I still
make a firm rule that I refuse to meet
anyone over the age of 40 without PPE.
My ribbon activities though are entirely
unaffected. When you think about it,
it’s the perfect social dis-
tancing sport! I spent the
six months of isolation
practicing in Hyde Park,
and appeared random-
ly on the front page of
The Times for it. I made
friends with many kids,
several doggos and a swan
that took my ribbon for
a swim in the lake. I had
to chase that swan for
four hours while calling
wildlife services. Let’s just
say that I’ve had many
strange encounters in these odd times;
half of them involving birds.
What is the music you listen to
while you do it?
I listen to a mix of Pop and Electronic
Dance Music. My favourites though are
mashups that I create myself with music
production software. If you have seen
me performing as a DJ, you would know
what I’m talking about!
