rooms they no longer need”, and that
Bristol University overpromised be-
cause they “wanted students to come
back so they could have our accom-
modation fees”. The Bristol Students’
Union has fully supported the strike
efforts. The main message of the cam-
paign is that the University “has a duty
of care to its students” that isn’t cur-
rently being met.
Prior to the strike, the campaign
with support from Bristol Students’
Union brought the issue to the Univer-
sity and did not receive satisfactory re-
sponse, prompting the strike. The rent
strike campaign officially launched
on October 14th, with things moving
swiftly and over 1000 students pledg-
ing to strike in the following ten days.
Other demands of the campaign
address the shoddy self-isolation con-
ditions that students are placed under.
The University has been asked to com-
mit to delivering food packages on
time, that food packages cater for all
dietary requirements, to provide basic
cleaning and menstrual products, al-
low outdoor access for students living
in flats with no positive cases, and reg-
ular mental health check-ins from the
University’s Residential Life Services.
Transparency on the role and actions
of security staff have also been asked
for.
The campaign organisers and stu-
dent union have also been in contact
with staff unions that represent the
cleaning and maintenance staff in
halls, and has included in their de-
mands that the University do not dis-
miss any staff members as a result of
the lost rent revenue.
Rent striking is not an action pro-
tected by law, however the campaign
believes that the University will not
take disciplinary action or evict its
own students during a pandemic be-
cause of their concern for reputation
and fear of public backlash. Bristol
University owns most of the housing
that students on strike reside in, al-
though there are also some students
under private housing providers, and
the campaign has sought eviction re-
sistance support from the community
organisation ACORN for these stu-
dents.
Bristol University says that students
are being provided with laundry ser-
vices, welfare support, and hygiene
products. The University also claims
that food is being delivered that caters
to dietary requirements, in contrast
to student reports. The University as-
sured that students taking part in the
strike will not be sanctioned academ-
ically, bursaries and scholarships will
not be affected, and international stu-
dents should not worry about any visa
issues.
Rent strikes in other universities
around the country have also been
planned. Students at the Universi-
ty of Manchester have also been or-
ganizing rent strikes
since early October,
with £300,000 be-
ing withheld as of
October 13th. Their
demands include
no-penalty contract
releases and a 40%
rent reduction for
students remaining
in halls.
Strikes in UoM
have been prompted
by a range of sim-
ilarly poor condi-
tions for students self-isolating. In late
September, over 100 students in West-
on Hall of UoM were forced to sleep
on the floor in communal spaces after
their flats were flooded, challenging
social distancing efforts. On October
8th, a 19 year old student was found
dead in the UoM Fallowfield residence
halls, having committed suicide due to
deteriorating mental health and severe
anxiety from lockdown.
More recently, on the morning of
Thursday November 5th, students
living in UoM Fallowfield campus
woke up to find themselves fenced in
by a chain of metal gates surrounding
them completely. The University had
put up metal fences in an effort to re-
strict entry and exit to the building to
a single, security-guarded point, and
no prior notification had been giv-
en to students. The fences were torn
down by students the same day dur-
ing a protest held in the evening. The
University already apologised “for the
concern and distress caused” and had
planned to remove the fences the fol-
lowing morning, but students had al-
ready taken them down.
Currently, 137 students have tested
positive for Covid-19 in the last two
weeks, however, these are not neces-
sarily all students in halls and there
has yet been no hall-wide lockdown.
However, students in halls that have
been found breaking social distancing
rules have been fined £50 each, which
is paid to the hall and as has been
seen in previous weeks, what occurs
in northern, badly affected areas of
Britain is often repeated in the south a
week or two later.

Firetrap hall
students share
moving issues
Calum Drysdale Editor-in-Chief
Students that were evacutaed from
halls in West London due to fire
risks have revealed problems that
arose during their move but have also
praised the College for the speed of
their response.
An anonymous student that spoke
to Felix, said that they felt that while
Chapter was an upgrade in terms of
room quality, the evacuation should
never have become necessary.
Responding to claims that there
were signs of deficient fire safety
measures that the College did not take
into consideration when renting the
rooms, the student said that “I would
like to think they were looking out for
us more than that”.
Another student that also agreed
to speak to Felix, on the condition of
annonymity said that the move itself
had been chaotic with a number of
students being forced to sleep without
sheets, duvets or pillows for two days
as the removals company hired by
College failed to deliver boxes to the
correct block of the building.
Despite a number of measures in
placetopreventboxesbeingmisplaced
this student told Felix that when they
found their box was not in the flat they
had been assigned they were told by
the company that the boxes had been
placed in a flat the floor below. When
the student went to investigate there
were not boxes. In fact the flat was not
even being occupied by Imperial Col-
lege students. It was only after appeal-
ing to the halls-wide groupchat that
the boxes were identified in a studio.
Students have expressed happiness,
however, at the increased quality of
room that they had recieved. Rooms
in the halls they previously occupied
costed £135 a week but the Chapter
flats given to students cost between
£209 and £279 a week at no additional
cost to the student themselves. In ad-
dition to this students have been told
that they will recieve compensation in
the form of a TFL travelcard for the
inconveniance of having to evacuate.
