KEEP THE CAT FREE
Arent strike in Bristol University,
which began on October 24th,
has amassed around 1200 participants
to become the largest student rent
strike in British history. Organised by
‘Bristol, Cut the Rent’, the campaign
protests the university’s handling of
students under lockdown in accom-
modation halls. Currently, over £1
million in rent money is being with-
held from the university.
As of November 5th, around 1500
students and staff at Bristol have test-
ed positive for COVID-19 so far. As
a result, many students living in halls
have been forced to self-isolate and
their reported living conditions have
been poor.
Food packages for students were of-
ten delivered late and insufficient for
the number of people living in the flat
– with stories of only two boxes of food
allocated to last an eight-person flat for
two weeks. Dietary requirements such
as vegetarian, gluten-free, and nut-al-
lergies were also overlooked. Students
report being confined to their flats for
days on end without any opportunity
for exercise, and in some cases with
no access to natural light. There are
also accounts about intimidation of
students by the security services that
have been present in halls to enforce
self-isolation. In addition, there are re-
ported instances of power cuts in flats,

Senior College staff have promised that
despite the change in governmental
Covid-19 restrictions, teaching will not
change and muti-mode teaching will
continue.
The College has said that work com-
pleted over the summer included
precautions against further tightening
of coronavirus public health measures
and so say that timetabled teaching will
not be affected as students will contin-
ue with planned, multi-mode teaching
that incorporates both face to face and
online teaching.
However, the new restrictions have
affected students in other ways. From
the 5th
November, students will not be
allowed to return home until the esti-
mated date of 2nd December, though
the government has admitted that this
date is liable to change in response to
infection rates in the country.
