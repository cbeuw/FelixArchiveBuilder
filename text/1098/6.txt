LETTERS 14 November 1997
the only reason the
College shits on us (ie the
bookstore (again!) and
looming tuition fees) is because we
let them? Obviously, this is a wider
issue than can't easily be discussed
in such a short letter but 1 hope
some people (especially Freshers -
don't be shy!) realise that there is a
lot more at stake here than their
wallets. We all have a right to free
education.

Dear Felix,
1 would like to thank everyone
for their interest in the article I
wrote for Felix about 'Closer' at the
National Theatre - I'm glad that
people take the time to read the
reviews. I have to admit that 1 am
amazed by the fact that people
managed to read the article, as I
myself found it a particularly
tedious and infuriating task (just
ask the people who sat around me
in the lecture while I screamed at
the mistakes). How anyone man-
aged to grasp the meaning, or
point of the review is beyond me -
I found it difficult and I wrote the
damn thing.
Despite the fact that I am
Welsh I hope that people can
appreciate that the article I wrote
resembled that which was pub-
lished in the loosest of forms - my
language and computing skills
being competent enough to at least
run a spell check! The reason for
the number of errors has vaguely
been justified to me, but it seems
that the readership of the paper
has been left in its ignorance mak-
ing me look like some dumb, inco-
herent caveman who shouldn't be
let near anything artistic let alone
write theatre reviews. (OK I might
LOOK like some dumb, incoherent
caveman but that really isn't the
point.)
I would therefore like to state
now that I had very little to do with
the review published other than
. giving someone else the bases to
express their artistic nature with my
ever-so-nicely constructed letters
of the English language.
I hope, however, that people
will continue to read the reviews,
and pay as much attention to any
future contributions. If anyone
would like a copy of the original
review then please just get in touch
and I would be delighted to pass
one on (E-mail w.Williams
@ic.ac.uk).
Thank you,
Matt Williams.
P.S. I hope that this letter has
escaped the treatment that the
review received!
Dear Jeremy
We believe that one of Felix's
primary functions is to promote the
activities of ICU to our students.
This year we have noticed that
there has been a distinct lack of
reporting on the activities of non-
sporting societies. In particular,
both Consoc and Labour Club have
gone to a great deal of trouble to
organise speaker events. To date
there have been two such events
and neither have been reported on
in your illustrious journal. We
understand that Felix wishes to
remain apolitical, but we feel that it
would be desirable for you to pro-
mote political discussion within our
apathetic student population.
We realise that you have
columnists commenting on
Westminster politics, however this
appears distant for many students
and our societies are aiming to
bring politics closer to Imperial
College. Surely this is a resource
that could be made better use of by
yourselves and unbiased reports of
political societies' events would
generate interest among College
members. An additional point is
that the more coverage Union soci-
ety activities receive, the more
interest students will take in their
Union.
We hope to see Felix reporters
at our next speaker events:
Labour Club:
- Tony Wright MP, 'The face of the
Radical Centre' (December 2nd)
- Tony Benn MP, 'The one and
only' (January)
Conservative Society:
- Senior Ex-Cabinet Minister
(November 19th)
- Sir George Young Bt, MP,
Shadow Defence Secretary
(December 3rd)
Yours
James Radway (Internal Vice
Chairman, Conservative society)
Ashton McGregor (Chair, ICU
Labour Club)

In the interview with Charlie
Joint, CJ said "BUSA will not allow
any medic to play for I.C...". When
the medics have become fully inte-
grated with l.C and are as much a
part of l.C as any other current
identifiable body, how can BUSA
discriminate?lf l.C really wants to
compete against the likes of
Loughborough in a national compe-
tition we need to pull on every
sporting resource possible.
The hockey club is preparing for
this as we are seeing an ever rise in
the standard and number of people
at trial, and so we are starting up a
mens 4th team. I would hope that
other sports clubs are looking
ahead too. On that note, if anyone
out there would like to know any-
thing about joining the hockey club,
or if you come to trial, and have not
seen your name on the hockey
notice board contact me:
p.bland@ic.ac.uk.

I feel there a few points to clear
up here. BUSA only allows stu-
dents to play for one university
(fair enough), so if ICSM register,
medical students must play for
the medical team and not the IC
team. The problem arises when
ICSM does not field a team in a
particular sport (eg fencing).
Strictly speaking, this means that
ICSM fencers can't play in BUSA
at all. Ed
Dear Sir,
I must respond to the 1CURFC
captain's rather bitter letter in last
week's pages [Felix 1096, 31
October]. Not having seen it before
Friday and having placed two rugby
reports and a photo in the most
promenant position on the back
page 1 was a little taken aback. Mr
Harrison seems to have an odd
grasp of diplomacy. Branding me
slapdash and lacking in profession-
alism is not the best way to gain
better press and is actually quite
remarkable considering the trouble
I have deciphering some of the
rugby reports poorly scrawled on
beer-stained bit of paper. The claim
that sports that do not interest me
being sidelined is also quite fatuous
as the issue referred to in the letter
included football, basketball, cross-
country, golf, hockey, canoeing and
fencing. Oh, and a rugby report
tacked on later (by another Felixer)
when an advert was pulled at the
last minute.
1 have appreciated the consis-
tent reports from the rugby club,
Mr Harrison, but please could you
spare us your petty grievences. And
regarding the number of pages in
the CivEng then perhaps you would
like to come into the office and
collate Felix on Thursday evening?
Yours faithfully,
Si [Sports Editor]
FELIX GREAT
Dear Felix
As a long time reader, I would
like to congratulate the exciting
new change that the dynamic edi-
torial team have undertaken with
regards to music. 1 would like to
comment on the innovative column
for soul and hip-hop. For so long
the music pages have been
hijacked by mostly obscure indie
bands whilst soul and hip-hop have
remained the much poorer relation.
I know that independent music is
predominant on campus but it is
important in the days of political
correctness to address other
minorities seriously.
I admire the style of the colum-
nist, Milen, who does not seem to
have the artistic pretentiousness
that the other writers do. His/her
bold phonetic style from the ghetto
blends in perfect unison with the
content of the material presented
and I would not be in the least bit
surprised if the writer were to be of
a "rude boy", hood wearing, flash
car driving disposition as opposed
to a respectable IC stereotype.
1 hope Felix keeps up the good
work for this year.
Yours faithfully
Sanjay Sikdar (Chem Eng 2)
Thanks very much, Sanjay. You
are by no means the first person
to complain of 'indie fascism' in
the music section. Thus I hope
you will not be the only one to
appreciate our new 'underground'
dance music and clubbing pages
starting this week, page 14 & 15.
