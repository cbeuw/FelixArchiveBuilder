Dear Felix
After having read this weeks
letters, they all seemed to be say-
ing how bad Felix was. I thought I
would just write to say that I, at
least, really enjoy reading it, mis-
prints and all.
I particularly like Hamish
Common's column, which is
always worth picking up Felix for.
Hope that this isn't too posi-
tive.

Dear Felix
Tuition fees? Slashed grants?
World famine? No - apparently the
real issues are "Disco 2000" and
the campaign for "Real Dance"
music.
But I suppose I should explain
the ents "regime" (I've been called
a lot of things, but this is the first
time I've been compared to Pol
Pot - cheers!). Basically, we aim for
ents to reach as many people as
possible, with a rolling programme
of club nights catering for different
musical tastes.
I accept that we can't please
all the people all of the time, but 1
think we are pretty successful at
keeping the majority happy.
Personally, I think the success
of an event can be measured by
the numbers on the dancefloor,
and love it or hate it "Disco 2000"
is a floor filler, and I'm afraid my
regime doesn't extend to forcing
people to dance.
Most seriously, I think suggest-
ing ents is wracked by complacen-
cy does a major disservice to the
ents staff who have worked so
hard to bring ICU ents up to their
current standard, and if we're
being honest, it's a standard that
matches any other college.
I hope you think the right per-
son has answered this.
Cheers

Surprise, surprise, another
block vote. What a complete waste
of time having an election; we may
as well just ask the Mary's exec
who they want representing the
entire college and give them the
job. Sod it, they may as well run the
place themselves.
But it's not the exec that really
gets my goat, nor do I have any-
thing against Andy Heeps - it's you
lot, the voters who are to blame.
To vofe you look at the candidates
available, read their manifestos, go
to the hustings and decide who
you want to do the job. You then
find a ballot box and register your
decision. You do not stay at home
because you can't be bothered to
spend thirty seconds at the polling
station. You do not vote for New
Election because you couldn't be
fagged to find out about the candi-
dates. And you do not go to your
favourite exec member and ask
"mummy, mummy, who do we
vote for this year?"
Not bothering to vote damages
the credibility of the system; block
voting makes a total mockery of it.
It's particularly galling when
you discover that the exec could
not come to a decision and it was
down to one person to decide, fair-
ly arbitrarily, who would be sup-
ported. Even more galling when
you discover that many of the exec
felt they had to go against their
own block vote to alleviate their
guilt at abandoning personal pref-
erence for dogmatic medical sup-
port. I am well aware that every
word I write here is another pie in
my face at the next hustings, but
elections are important and I have
no time for anyone who consis-
tently acts to subvert them.
The medical schools, like it or
not, are now part of Imperial
College, and should be cooperating
with the Union. They face changes
that are going to be hard to swal-
low and everyone involved is going
to have to work hard to achieve the
equanimity that should have been
reached five years ago. It's time
1CSMU stopped behaving like a
child bitter over some imagined
injustice, sat up straight and voted
properly.
