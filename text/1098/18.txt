ogfather is the 20th
Discworld novel by Terry
Pratchett, of whom, I
should state at the outset, I've
never been a fan. As far as I can
remember, the Discworld floats
upon the back of a massive turtle.
It's a world at the core of which rel-
atively sane, normal people co-
exist with the wacky wizards of
Unseen University; and this core is
cocooned within a world of magic
that only the 'dead and magic' and
credulous young children can see.
This fantastical world bears an
uncanny parallel to our own child-
hood dimensions. Well-known and
comforting characters tumble
through its pages: bogeymen, the
skeletal figure of Death, Jack Frost,
the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny
and tubby old Father Christmas -
except that the latter two have
been incarnated as the Soul Cake
Duck and the Hogfather.
Now there exists a bunch of
disagreeable people called the
Auditors who hate life. They feel
that it's disorderly and, quite
frankly, just too untidy to put up
with. So they hatch a cunning plot:
to kill the Hogfather. To this end
they engage the villainous Teatime
('"Teh-a-tim-eh',sir... Everyone gets
it wrong"), who happens to be a
completely certifiable member of
the Guild of Assassins. With the
Hogfather temporarily out of the
way, it seems only natural - by a
delightful quirk of logic - that Death
himself, with a series of rather lame
HO.HO.HO.s, should step hero-
ically into the breach... You see, the
Hogfather's elimination is not just a
commercial pity: it signals the end
of the world as we know it, for
obscure reasons that are eventually
explained. Mixed up in this battle
for the soul of humanity are the air-
headed wizards, the wonderfully
practical Susan, who is Death's
granddaughter by adoption, an oh-
god of Hangovers, a wizard-invent-
ed Al machine named Hex which
throws a tantrum when it's refused
its FTB (Fluffy Toy Bunny), a group
of dopey beggars who live on the
haute cuisine of mud-and-old-
boots and a million more sporadic
and delightful characters.
The book is brilliantly inventive
and has a wonderful feel-good fac-
tor for all those inner children out
there. It's also whimsical, idiosyn-
cratic, quixotic, excitable and con-
fused: there are repeated jumps
between scenes and much sporad-
ically obscure reasoning. In particu-
lar, the long-awaited elucidation of
the plot ultimately proves to be
embarrassingly incoherent. Even
Death eventually metamorphoses
into a talkative New-Age-Bloke
with a conscience and a dreadful
sense of humour. Well, I ask you...!
I have to insist that my opinions
on Pratchett remain valid. His nov-
els are insubstantial, frothy pieces
of wildly invented fantasy with
sprawling plots so fantastically rid-
dled with holes that they wouldn't
sieve rocks. Nevertheless, this
book is a bubbly, beguiling concoc-
tion that sparkles and wriggles
incessantly with a sort of frenetic
enthusiasm. Prejudices aside, the
author's obviously having so much
fun making fun of the world and of
his world that it would be churlish
to refuse to even smile back... and
once you start smiling it's impossi-
ble to stop. O

Thought for the day
No.5: That curry bill
1 wish to avoid becoming a second
Simon Baker (and after his face-
meltingly dull article on EMU, none
of us would want that). Hence, I
am going to avoid snidey but very
poignant comments about the far-
cically rigged election of the new
ICU President, at least for the
moment. This week we concern
ourselves with matters arising just
after the dramatic results' release
(it's just a shame that only about
ten per cent of the South
Kensington posse could be both-
ered contributing to them).
Anyway, those of you who are
still reading after that rather tire-
some tirade might like to know that
the Felix editor, the Features Editor,
myself and a certain Mr. Jon
Walmsley (an esteemed denizen of
the nether regions of Southside
Bar) went for a curry after the elec-
tion result. (Felix recommend
Kwality Tandoori, down by the tube
station for the creamiest Tikka
Masala in town. Oh, do say hello to
Mr. Khan for me.) The usual con-
versation flow resulted; moving
from angry screeched speeches
about the treachery of the Mary's
block vote; onto food (did 1 men-
tion how hungry we were?),
favourite beers of the assembled
dining foursome; the upcoming IC
Rag beer festival (which, by the
time you read this, will be a dim
and distant hungover memory),
back to food (yes, we were starv-
ing) and so on. Poppadoms, nan
bread? Korma or madras? Chutney
or that weird orange minty stuff?
(Forgive my ignorance). Anyway,
you know the score.
Eventually the meal came to an
end. Much lager had been con-
sumed; we could almost forget the
election; everyone was stuffed. Jon
Walmsley was falling asleep; Jon
Trout was breaking wind; Jeremy
was trying to convince me not to
stand for Felix editor. Then the
problems began.
Yes, the bill arrived. It is practi-
cally inconceivable that just one
piece of paper could cause such
widespread controversy. No for-
mulation since those of Adam
Smith, Albert Einstein and Charles
Darwin has enjoyed a greater
vogue. At this juncture I must point
something out. According to UCAS
rules, the four of us had a com-
bined A-level points score of 118.
(Eleven As and a B). Yet we were
still completely unable to decide
who owed how much of the bill.
The problems were caused by
two people having insufficient read-
ies; a trip to the cash machine
solved the immediate problem, but
not the prevailing one. Why did four
young men with a reasonable dose
of common sense find themselves
having the following conversation?
"Right, I've put in twenty-five quid,
and the bill was sixty quid, so
somebody owes me ten quid."
(Nothing is ever that simple.)
"Hang on though, because Jeremy
didn't have rice, so he should have
two quid off."
"Fair enough then, you put in
eleven quid, I put in eight quid, us
two both put in twenty-five quid.
Somebody owes us money."
"I'll take some off next month's
rent."
"Yeah, but how much?"
"Wait. You and Jon owe me money
for the bet on the election result."
"Look at it this way... erm... no...
wait... that's not right..."
"Look, lads, let's start again."
Calling all mathematics profes-
sors and postgraduates. Is there
any way this problem can be
solved? Eight-dimensional matri-
ces? Line integrals? Vector calcu-
lus? Perhaps an analytical solution
is impossible. Could we try a
numerical method? We certainly
couldn't find one, and 1 don't think
I'll ever get my ten quid back.
Did I mention the election
yet...?
