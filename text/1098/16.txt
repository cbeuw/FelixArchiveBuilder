•WILL IT SNOW FOR CHRISTMAS?
Starring: Dominique Reymond, Daniel Duval
Director: Sandrine Veysset
W
illiam Hill will not let me
place a bet on a white
Christmas, nor will they
offer me any odds on the holiday
box office chart. Nevertheless, 1
shall put my mouth where my
money isn't and predict that we
shan't see snow and Will It Snow
For Christmas? won't threaten the
success of big Hollywood movies.
This is for several reasons; partly
because it is a
subtitled French
film, partly
because it has
such a feeble
s t o r y l i n e
(attempting a
forecast to
answer the
question in the
title did not keep
me on the edge
of my seat for an
hour and a half),
but also because
the characters
are only mildly
engaging. This is
a critical failure
for a film that
relies on our
understanding of
screen relation-
ships to explore a family's mutual
love.
Specifically, the film deals with
maternal love in a situation where a
single mother lives with her seven
illegitimate children. Writer-
Director Sandrine Veysset evidently
has a great deal of respect for
women who go through the trial of
motherhood, and even dedicated
the work to her own mother. This
admiration has, however, blinkered
her own perception of the subject.
The main problem with the film
is that all the characters are carica-
tures, so it is difficult to take them
seriously. The children are too
clever, too unrealistically obedient;
the mother so loving that she
incessantly mollycoddles and holds
them. The entire film lacks subtlety
and Veysset
often resorts to
straightforward
repetition to
ensure her
message gets
across.
P e r h a p s
these mistakes
are under-
s t a n d a b l e
when we
realise that this
is the director's
d e b u t .
Dismissing the
film outright
would be
unreasonable,
since Veysset
has accom-
plished a lot. It
is never easy to
get children to act convincingly, yet
seemingly natural performances
have been extracted from them. In
certain scenes, one even wonders
whether a script was ever written.
But, ultimately, the fact remains
that organising seven children for
school in the morning is my idea of
a nightmare, not entertainment.D

LONDON FILM FESTIVAL
LONDON
FILM
FESTIVAL
The 41st London Film Festival is
now well and truly under way. If
you haven't yet bought your
tickets for the various premieres
and gala screenings then you'd
better act quickly as seats are
going quickly.
For a chance to see a big
Hollywood film months before its
release you could do far worse
than try The End of Violence. It
stars Bill Pullman, Andie
MacDowell and Gabriel Byrne and
is an intelligent look at the issues of
power and violence in the not too
distant future. It is not released
until January 9 but is showing twice
on Thursday at the Odeon West
End. Ticket prices start at £6.75
and can be bought by phoning the
Festival Hotline on 0171 4201122.
Another film examining the
motives behind violence is
Resurrection Man. In this case,
however, the film revolves around
the real subject of the Shankhill
Butchers, a Northern Ireland gang
OUT NOW
14 November 1997
who murdered 19 people in the
late seventies. They claimed to be
Loyalist, yet their victims included
five Protestants demonstrating the
purely psychotic nature of their
enterprise. Directed by Marc
Evans, who was recently inter-
viewed by Felix, the film plays at
the Odeon West End twice on
Friday 21 November and tickets
are available from the phone num-
ber above.
Twentyfour Seven is another
British film receiving its premiere at
the festival. Directed and written
by Shane Meadows, this sees Bob
Hoskins setting up a boxing club in
an attempt to restore dignity to his
town's dissolute youth. We follow
his unwilling recruits battle through
various trials, egged on by Hoskins
in excellent form. It shows at the
Odeon West End on Wednesday.
For a more international flavour
you could try a sample from the
"French Revolution" or "Facing
East" strands. These are pro-
grammes featuring a variety of
films from debut and established
directors from various countries.
More information can be found in
the festival brochure available from
the Evening Standard Film on the
Square ticket booth in Leicester
Square. CI
If you haven't been reading Felix over the last couple of weeks, here
is the best of what's showing now:
Face/Off
John Travolta and Nicolas Cage send each other up in this face-swapping
thriller. Unmissable if you're after a superior action film.
LA Confidential
This take on '50s cinema goes behind the city's glossy image and
uncovers a corrupt police force, powerful gangsters and rife prostitution.
A Life Less Ordinary
If you can find Ewan McGregor's new film still showing then go and see
it. Cameron Diaz co-stars in this brilliant offbeat romance.

Gl Jane is released today. It stars Demi Moore as a
US Navy officer determined to become the first
female to break into the elite Navy Seals. Reviewed
last week, this is a film aimed at all those women who
have always wanted to give the male establishment a
good kicking.
As ever, the Odeon Kensington have kindly
donated some great prizes related to the film. We
have a pair of tickets for the film and a CI Jane army
cap and dog-tag to give to the first three people
picked out of the proverbial hat who know the
answer to the following question. Answers to the
