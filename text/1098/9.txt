I admit I know little about
Formula One racing - and care
less. But recently it has come into
the public eye in a rather disturbing
manner. The Government has had
its first real whiff of sleaze.
The background to all of this
involves tobacco sponsorship. Not,
one would think, Labour's favourite
form of business, indeed it made
political capital out of criticising
Tory links with it during their stay in
power. The Government had com-
mitted itself to a blanket ban on
tobacco advertising, including an
unequivocal promise in their mani-
festo. In mid-October, a closed
meeting was held in 10 Downing
Street between the Prime Minister
and Max Mosley, Bernie Ecclestone
and the lobbyist David Ward. The
former two are the head of the FIA
(the governing body of Formula
One) and the head of the
Constructors' Association respec-
tively. Mosley has the unfortunate
family link of being the son of the
late British fascist Sir Oswald
Mosley. This is the meeting in
which Opposition MPs say a deal
was struck to extricate Formula
One the blanket ban on tobacco
advertising.
So what are they playing at? At
first sight this seems like a fairly
standard Labour sell-out. They did
the same thing with hunting - sup-
porting the idea of banning it, then
deciding to kill off a bill which
would do exactly that - Mike
Foster's Private Members' Bill. Their
next fudge was to ban it on Ministry
of Defence property (a quick fix to
placate the anti-hunting lobby),
resulting in the all the landowners
who hunt and lease their land to
the M O D promising to cancel their
deals, removing vast tracts of land
from Army use.
Of course suspicions were
aroused that it wasn't just a simple
sell-out. Most people forgive
Governments for these, if made on
occasion - the Conservatives were
as capable of it as the present
Government. As I had outlined
before, it seems that there were
more sinister developments under
the surface. First of all the minister
responsible for signing the
Government up for the ban in
Europe, Tessa Jowell - a junior
health minister, had a conflict of
interest. Her husband, lawyer David
Mills, was a former director of
Benetton Formula (an Fl compa-
ny). He still works for them as a
legal advisor. Opposition M P s
seized on this, but it soon became
clear that she was carrying the can
for a decision taken far higher up -
the fateful October meeting in
Downing Street that I discussed
before. One guest, Max Mosley, is
a member of Labour's 1000 Club,
(admission at least £1000) a club
enabling member to 'network' with
party bigwigs. Bernie Ecclestone
was reputed to have given millions
of pounds to the Tories during their
time in Government, and switched
sides to Labour before the election.
If his contribution to Labour is on
the same scale as to the Tories, this
would extremely grave implications
for a Government priding itself on
its lack of sleaze.
This situation was compounded
when Labour hid behind the rule-
book, stating that no announce-
ment could be made until Labour
published its accounts - in a year's
time. They initially refused to say
how much had been given to the
party, then after some pressure
said it was "over £5000". When the
Conservatives played this trick,
Tony Blair demanded openness,
with complete justification.
However he has found an easier to
way to extricate himself from this
entanglement in a move made on
the advice of Sir Patrick Neill, the
I M
new Chairman of the
Standards and Privileges g M L l
Committee. He decided to fcWK
hand back the entire dona-
tion to Mr Ecclestone, something
which must have hurt if his contri-
bution was the size that it was
reputed to be.
Naturally Bernie Ecclestone
denies ever trying to influence
Government policy - which puts
him in a remarkably long list of peo-
ple who contribute sums of money
"no strings attached" but who seem
to receive a kinder ministerial ear
when they have problems with pol-
icy. The sinister thing about corrup-
tion is that it is never there when a
new Government takes the reins,
but it comes in slowly, as ministers
adjust to their positions of power,
and Government policy begins to
become more restricted as time
goes on (witness the dying days of
the Conservative administration -
any new policy statement would
simply be a U-turn on something
they did previously). Corruption
thrives in secrecy, and the earlier
cash donations and meetings are
more publicised the better. This
present case seems to represent
politics and spin-doctoring, if not at
its most corrupt, certainly at its
most cynical. Now is the time for
the Prime Minister to address these
problems, before they begin to
walk down the well-worn and slip-
pery path.

I made my first ever stew this
weekend and it was remarkably
tasty so I thought I'd share the
experience with you.
First of all 1 walked, not rocked,
down Electric Avenue (aka Brixton
market) and bought I lb of stewing
beef for £1.20 as well as a vast
quantity of vegetables. Back in the
kitchen I cut the beef into bite
sized cubes and put them in a
bowl to marinade in a pint of
cheap bitter (stout is probably
even better). This tenderizes the
meat and gives you time to get on
with chopping the vegetables. If I
remember rightly 1 used a carrot,
half a swede, a turnip, a stick of
celery, an onion half an aubergine
(salted, left to bleed and then
rinsed. This removes the astringent
taste) and about l/21b of mush-
rooms. Once everything was
roughly chopped 1 put everything
apart from the onion in an oven
proof dish together with a large
pinch of salt, half a tablespoon of
flour, a few bay leaves, some rose-
mary and the beer from the beef
marinade. I then fried the onion
and the beef in some olive oil in a
very hot pan just to seal the meat
and produce lots of lovely caramel.
It's always a good idea to heat you
spices so near the end of the frying
extravaganza I added about a tsp
of pepper, a pinch of nutmeg, a
small pinch of ground cloves and a
heaped tablespoon of paprika to
the pan. Gorgeous aromas! Then
plonk, into the dish with the veg-
etables, rinse the pan out with a
little water and add that too and
hey presto, it was ready for the
oven.
I cooked my stew in a medium
oven, call it 375°F, 190°C, gas
mark 5 for about 2 hours with the
lid on and then 1 hour with the lid
off to get a nice thick sauce.
Mmmm, it was beautifully warm in
my caravan.
1 served my stew with some
boiled new potatoes but it would
have been an ideal opportunity to
make some dumplings. For these
you need one part suet and two
parts self raising flour and the
usual pinch of salt. Mash these all
up and add just enough water to
bind. Divide the dough into kingy-
marble sized balls, roll these
around in some flour, place them
on top of the stew as far apart as
possible and put the stew back in
the oven with the lid on for anoth-
er Vi hour and there you go.
Although mine was a beef stew
made with beer I reckon you could
make something equally whole-
some with pork and some cider or
lamb (even better, mutton) and
loads of rosemary. As usual, it's
personal preference and availabili-
ty that matter, not following
recipes to the letter which
inevitably turns you into a Delia
Smith. Antoine
