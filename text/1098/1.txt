students have
finally elected a
president and
deputy president
(clubs and soci-
eties). At the fourth
time of asking,
Andrew Heeps was
returned as presi-
dent and Charlie
Joynt DP(CS^)
Tuesday evening.
The results were
dominated by a
cross-campus med-
ical block vote.
Andrew Heeps, a
third year medic
from the Charing
Cross site of ICSM,
polled 57% of the
overall vote, in com-
parison to the South
Kensington based
candidate Mark
Baker (Computing
UG4), who man-
aged only 37.6% of the overall vote,
despite managing almost 70% of
the more populated but seemingly
more apathetic South Kensington
campus.
In the election for DP (C&S), an
unchallenged Charlie Joynt was
swept in by a massive 85% over
new election, with solid support
from all sites.
Andy Heeps
was "shocked"
at his 300
majority, and
was "very
pleased at the
medical sup-
port at South
Kensington". He
also praised Eric
Allsop for hav-
ing done such a
"fantastic job"
over the last
year, especially
with the elec-
tions. Mark
Baker dryly commented that the
students had "voted to maintain
the status quo - a fat Tory presi-
dent", before more seriously con-
gratulating Andy on getting the
Charlie |oynt, the new Deputy President {CSS} back to
back with Andy Heeps, now the President of ICU.

was unlikely that the
fraud was part of any
kind of organised cam-
paign, but rather "more
likely by accident than
by design". The defeat-
ed candidate, Mark
Baker, also said that he
was satisfied that the
result was reached
fairly.
Several people
have privately voiced
concerns over the
medical block vote.
Whilst it was elsewhere
noted that the South
Kensington/medical
divide was disappoint-
ing, the conclusion on
who to vote for
appears to have been
reached by a split deci-
sion in an unofficial
St.Mary's executive
committee meeting.

block vote. He expressed sadness
over the South Kensington turnout,
only 744 out of nearly well over
7,000 students. Charlie Joynt's only
recorded comment of the evening
was: "DP (C85)? What's that?"
There were isolated cases of
electoral impropriety in the
Presidential election, with at least
six of the votes
proxied from
the clinical
CXWMS stu-
dents seemingly
duplicated at
the ballot box.
The returning
officer, the out-
going President
Eric Allsop was
however "satis-
fied that, having
c h e c k e d
through all the
proxied votes, it
Photo: Froggy could have had
no effect on the
final outcome." He added that the
people concerned would have to
explain themselves to the Union
disciplinary committee. Rob Clarke,
ICU DP (F&S) commented that it
Ballot boxes at South Kensington
were not doing a roaring trade.
