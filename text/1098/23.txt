Canoe Polo?
Continuing our recent series of
spectacular defeats, IC Canoe Polo
Team were invited to play ULU,
presumably their chance for
revenge for only beating us 2-0 in
our last meeting. The ULU team
have always considered them-
selves superior to the IC shambles,
mainly since we never train, don't
take ourselves seriously and
devote our time to fooling about
on rivers, drinking, and having a
good time.
We have always considered
ourselves the better club, for pre-
cisely the same reasons.
From the first whistle, the ULU
offence were obviously put off by
Simon's magnificent girth, as he
overcame a significant weight dis-
advantage to beat them to the ball,
despite their spangly new carbon-
fibre boats. However, despite
demonstrations of stamina and
length by our attacking paddlers,
ULU persisted in dribbling all over
our backs. Our goalkeeper, Solid
Grade 5" Adam, did an admirable
job of defending the delicate
wooden frame of our goal from
the nasty hard ball, unfortunately
this skill didn't extend to also pro-
tecting the net as ULU kept on
poking it in.
The game was refereed with
ULU's characteristic lack of bon-
homie. However, in fairness to
them we should perhaps have
realised that there were some
rules to the game, and perhaps
even had a go at learning some of
them. Even so, a yellow card for
Old Man Colin was perhaps a little
harsh, since he was still feeling
delicate after the previous day's
pub crawl around the monopoly
board. This state of health was lit-
tle improved by the ULU paddlers'
repeated attempts to roll him over
and force him to submit.
ULU came up front, over and
over again; we were buggered if
we could stop them. We were truly
stuffed.

QMW v ICWAFC
Walthamstow was our destination,
but the tube station was shut and
just to further inconvenience us,
no buses were running either. So
six birds minus kit arrived two
hours late, with the kit and super-
woman Freud later. Feeling sorry
for us, the opposition lent us two
(shit) players.
Everyone worked hard in the
first half, Captain "Pisshead-ani-
mal" commanded with her usual
style, despite reeling from a head
injury and inability to see due to
the previous night's shenanigans.
Helen proved to be a bit "shit-hot"
in goal, Hacker Lyle was racing all
over the place, Super-woman
Freud fought in her usual dynamic
style, and Vasso stuck like Vasso-
line to any attackers - taking a few
bitches out in the process.
The second half and we were
knackered. Young Scrubber kept
missing chances but then she did
have a dodgy ankle. Wee Marisa
shouted and shouted (but nobody
heard - a bit of a throat problem I
feel) and ran and ran. The full-time
whistle and tea were nice.

Prague's manhood. [Are you sure
you know what you're saying? - Si]
QMW 5 - 0 ICWAFC
RSMHC v St BART'S III
After nearly upsetting the premier-
ship champions in a close game on
Sunday, RSM came out to beat St
Barts III in a convincing 4 - 0 victo-
ry. Faisal scored first from a short
corner; Dav converted a second
from an accurate pass by captain
Maruf, who later went on to score
the fourth; Henry scored the third
with a deft touch.
Alas, Tim failed to score on the
pitch although he later made up
for this with his "friend" behind a
tree in Battersea park. Nick (goal-
keeper) won man of the match
after a vital save late in the second
half. However, Ashraf was a supe-
rior man of the match on Sunday!
RSMHC 4 - 0 St Bart's III
IC SNOOKER v
BRISTOL
Last Saturday saw the first friendly
match of the new year for Imperials
Snooker Club, the reigning National
Champions. A depleted A-team
gave debuts to Alan and Greg who
performed admirably but could not
help the team to victory. The B-
team, giving debuts to Richard,
Ketal and John, fared far better and
with a captain's lead from Aki
IC GOLF v ROYAL
HOLLOWAY
The grudge match got off to a poor
start when the home team (that's
us) couldn't find their own course.
Unfortunately Holloway possessed
advanced navigational equipment
(ie a map) and actually turned up.
The top order managed to pro-
duce two points with Marx coming
back strongly in the first match and
The Stalker resisting his deer fetish
to concentrate on his game.
Sadly the rest of the team only
managed to produce a pair of
antlers courtesy of a stag and a
five iron at the fifteen hole (and
point blank range). Chief of the
culprits was The Mower who
together with Hurricane "played
like a wanker". Other excuses from
the rest of the team included the
shit weather, stampeding deer, the
night before and a complete lack
of hand-eye co-ordination.
Success beckons in the nationals.

ICAFC IV v RSM I
RSM were defeated in this
"friendly match," by a team of
randoms representing IC
fourths. We had a hockey player,
a fifth teamer, two third team-
ers, two members of last year's
4th team, one random, but only
four current fourth teamers. We
dominated the first half and
deservedly took a two goal lead
- we could have had more.
In the second half we
relaxed, but we were always sure
of our win. The previous
Saturday IC fourths were sound-
ly beaten by a team in division
one - the same division as RSM
and it is without question that
RSM will struggle, and they will
probably get relegated, what a
shame! RSM should disband and
stick to what they do best as is
epitomised by the song about
their picks and shovels. All good
fun though!
For the record David and
Adam scored quality goals.
Good luck RSM and see you in
division two next year.
ICFC IV Select XI 2 - 1 RSM I
eventually triumphed 12-8. With
the number of new players avail-
able this year the future looks
bright for the two teams.

ICHC I v RFH I wk
The game started in high fcWE
spirits after our resounding
victory against Kings, however
the medics proved a little
more of a handful. Hindered
by injuries, the B-team turned
out for a ruff-in-the-jungle
puntang pounding. Lucky for
us Rentboy was back from his
horrendous dance injury and
in top form as he led as mid-
field general, until he was
mortally wounded and came
off. Scoring was again opened
by inspirational captain
Chicken bol, to be followed
up by a solo run by 2.4 inch-
es, deftly placed into the bot-
tom left hand of the net after
a one-on-one with the keep-
er. A small defensive error led
to two goals being conceded.
ICHC 2 - 2 Royal Free

Q M W I v ICFC I
Superstar Amo, subject of a $300
bid from Bury, and Steve Fleming
were missing but it was a game we
should have won. Alex Marcos and
Warren Tube wasted several
chances before Q M W scored. Nak
Tipp - who had a decent 2nd half
for Imperial - was booked, while
Q M W should have had both their
strikers sent off. In, the 2nd half IC
pushed forward for an equaliser
after Mikael Askerdal replaced
Adam Butcher, and Psycho, the
hero from the UCL Cup game,
somehow managed not to score
from 3 yards out in the final
minute.
