The Man With The Ten Bob Note - Part III
A story by Buz Barstow
The course was prepared and the spacecraft
would be in position in a few minutes. All
engines were prepped to escape the moon's
gravity. The man was looking forward to;
what? He didnt even know what he was look-
ing forward to anymore. He'd stopped think-
ing about that about two iterations ago.
This would take some time, in the strug-
gle to get home, that had cost so many
lives, his own, the woman's and had made
him into a murderer, he had lost sight of
what kept him going. All it took was fifteen
days, or perhaps only about two. It was-
n't really clear anymore. What had
brought him here was of decreasing rel-
evance. The mission that he had been
sent to the moon to accomplish had
slipped into the past. He might as well
have not bothered getting out of bed
on the day he was sent on this mis-
sion.
The asymptotic drive engaged.
He'd given up thinking about home
a long time ago, only getting off the
rock that was now spiralling away.
Even the odd feeling that always
accompanied using the inertialess
drive escaped him.
The man reclined in the
cockpit seat. Out of a sense of
duty, and of morbid fascination,
he surveyed the death throes
of the moon through the opti-
cal telescopes at the rear of
the pod. With considerable
enhancement by the com-
puter, he could see the
moon beginning to crumble,
like a piece of over dry
dough being needed by
baker, and the flakes spin-
ning off to form the plat-
ter that surrounded the
black hole. It would be
quite a sight to see if
you hadn't experienced
it first hand.
The pod was navi-
gating an area of
space swarming with
violenty energetic
ionized particles.
Any electrical sys-
tem, especially the
pod's inertialess
drive unit would
be vulnerable to
this hazard. Put
simply, the iner-
tialess drive
relied on a
consequence
of the unified
field theory,
that allowed
the unifica-
tion of elec-
tromagnetism and gravity, whereby the drive,
using electrical components could generate a
gravitational field to ensure that all of the con-
tents of the pod were accelerated uniformly, pro-
tecting the occupants from inertial forces, allow-
ing accelerations only dreamt of before.
The pod reeled against a shower of stray
plasma. All the controls were fried. The inertialess
drive was failing. The man would be crushed by
inertial forces if he didn't do something soon.
The pod was still accelerating. No time to think,
no more time. Was this the fate that befell all of
the iterations that left the moon? He didn't have
time to answer that last point.
The pod squashed, the man was crushed.
Any normal man, who'd experienced normal
events would be off to leave the universe for
good, trapped forever in the black holes gravity
well. Not this one though. He was uniquely
detached from the normal stream of things, and
this area of space was similarly touched.
The pod lay crushed in a body of water. The
man drowsed in the pilot's seat, as if he hadn't
quite realised he was alive. He stirred, and the
what remained of the playback display came on.
His commander appeared on screen. "Now
you've landed I can tell you the purpose behind
your mission. It is to retrieve an artifact left
behind on the moon by the survey team. This
artifact is believed to be of alien origin. Its pur-
pose is unknown to us, but you are to make all
efforts to retrieve it. Good luck."
After that a series of displays detailing the
artifact appeared on screen, and the playback
ended. The man hadn't had the time or the incli-
nation to wonder where he was.
He did make the effort to look to the pasen-
ger seat though, where the woman, whose dead
form he'd left in waste recycling on the moon,
sat. She had the same calm about her that she
had when she lay on the floor, but was unusually
conscious. She stared at him and slipped away
from his view. He might as well have been back
in the primordial soup on the moon. He wasn't
though. The pod window was surrounded by
muddied water. The man climbed out through
the dorsal hatch. He'd given up caring about the
presence of sufficient oxygen, dangerous organ-
isms or toxic chemicals.
The world outside was like his home. There
were trees, grass, a blue sky, rain clouds, every-
thing. He'd been given a second chance at life,
he assumed by the woman, whose identity he
was now having serious doubts about.
He was free to do as he pleased. Make all he
could of his new lease of life. Make what of what
life? He'd left that on the moon with the man he
killed.
He'd have to time to mull. On where he did
land. It wasn't as clear as before that he had
landed on a moon. At least not the moon he'd
been sent to investigate. It most certainly resem-
bled it, but the computer didn't seem to agree
with that observation. He'd been detached from
the normal
stream of
events, and
placed else-
where, either for
observation, or
manipulation.
He'd have a
long time to think
about the answers
to those questions.
So, the tramp's
ring says something.
The skin though,
beneath the dirt there's
a once healthy tan.
Almost like the colour
the hills that surround
Bogota seem to go on
one of its worse days.
Not a flattering metaphor,
but there wasn't much
flattering about the man.
The man took a look at
the hills. Shit, that city
stunk. Worse place he'd ever
worked. Not that the envi-
ronment mattered much to
the man, he could afford air
con. He could afford a lot of
things. He couldn't buy god
damn loyalty though.
Make one small mistake,
and they take it out of your hide.
Your reputation stands for noth-
ing. You might as well be a rookie,
a punk with no style and a passion
for crudity. Just one kidnapping
goes wrong.
Fuck 'em. This one would go
right. At least reputation had bought
him a chance to do his bosses a free-
bie. He looked over the dossier. John
Forbes, Englishman, geologist in
Columbia prospecting for oil for BP.
Packed 4 bodyguards. Tough freebie.
No wonder they'd given him a chance
to redeem himself. No fool would take
this kind of job.
