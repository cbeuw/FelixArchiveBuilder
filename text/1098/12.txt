likes of Jamiroquai and Incognito,
they got the crowd up and dancing,
and 1 was surprised when their thir-
ty minutes were up that they had
actually been on for that long. The
only thing that let them down
slightly, in my view, was their lack
of any original material.
Last, but not least, came Dust -
possibly the only true 'guitar group'
of the night. Their pleasant vocal
tunes (occasionally sung out of
tune) and strummed rhythm guitar
parts being enhanced by some
excellent choices of effects from
their lead guitarist, Alok. Although
fairly tight and pleasing to the ear,
their songs did lack some of the
originality of Fold's and they also
suffered in comparison to he musi-
cal skills of Funk 'n' Disorderly.
However, in terms of original mate-
rial, they displayed a lot of song-
writing potential.
So, by the end all that was left
was for the crowd to vote, the
judges to tally up their score (which
must have been done half way
through Dust's set as this is when
they left) and the winner to be
announced. The judging was based
on three categories: musical con-
tent, stage presence, and per-
ceived potential. When quizzed
about originality, one of the judges
replied (sic), "I prefer a band to do
other people's stuff well than to
play their own stuff crap." Now
you know that and if you didn't
know already, the winners were
Funk n' Disorderly.
It just remains for me to say well
done to them and well done to all
the other acts. Oh, and to thanks
Southern Comfort and ICU Ents and
its manager and my family... H

L
ast Friday night saw the long-
awaited (at least for the par-
ticipants) Southern Comfort
Battle of the Bands. This was just
one of the southern regional heats
that could lead ultimately to a place
in the final and so to a £ 1000 prize.
Participating were four examples of
- Imperial's fine talent: Fold, Rekless
Karnage, Funk 'n' Disorderly and
Dust (performing in that order due
to a draw held earlier).
As is customary, the gig started
late with Fold's four members kick-
ing off proceedings with their styl-
ish punk/indie sounds. With music
that seems to be influenced by any-
thing from 70's funk to Sonic Youth
(due largely to the vocalist
jocelyn's voice), Fold are definitely
a band to watch. Always willing to
experiment, their use of backing
tracks to provide some great sound
effects and twisted samples com-
bined, at times, to create an ener-
getic and original set. However,
the band were clearly nervous at
the beginning which was not
helped by the annoying amount of
mic feedback initially present. This
soon dissipated, though, and
towards the end, the real Fold
emerged, pogoing and calling on
the crowd to 'funk'. The one thing
that 1 missed was their sublime
interpretation of Walk Like An
Egyptian that they performed at
some of their previous gigs. All in
all a competent and tight set.
Next on was Rekless Karnage,
not so much a band as one man
and a computer. Some might say
that trance has no place in what
could be seen as a guitar-based
competition, but 1 would have to
disagree. Music is music, however
you play it. Although the tracks
were interesting and easy to dance
to (after slight problems with the
sequencer were overcome) they
lacked the subtlety that is required
for really good trance. They never
really created a mood in a way that,
for example, FSOL managed in
their early days (as Amorphous
Androgynous on the Tales of
Ephidrina album) or reached the
heights created by the harder
trance/techno of the likes of
Thomas Heckman (DRAX). This
was also rather compounded by
the fact that there was a pause
between each track and not a con-
tinual flow of ideas one into anoth-
er, as is usual in clubs.
After the small body count of
the previous act, Funk n'
Disorderly's seven members (con-
sisting of a saxophonist, trumpeter,
keyboardist, bassist, guitarist,
drummer and vocalist) seemed like
an overkill. Fortunately this did not
detract from the excellence of their
set. From start to finish, it was
almost professionally polished,
with all the musicians displaying
obvious talent for their chosen
instruments. Playing music by the
