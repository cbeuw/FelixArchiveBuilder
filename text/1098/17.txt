GAMES 17
This is another older game
(I think about 2 years now)
which has been re-released
•iin budget format, it is a
Lucas Arts White Label' release and
so should cost you around ten
quid. The main selling point, from
reading the box and credits, is that
the idea for the story was from
Steven Spielberg. He originally
wanted to make it into a film but
could not get tlie money. Instead it
got made into this very competent
adventure game.
I am the first to admit that I'm
not terribiy good at these puzzle-
solving, walk around and work it
help from some friends and man-
aged to finish the game within the
excellent, obviously the story line
was good enough for the film that

where you kicked yourself when
you saw how they were done. The
•bwever exceptions weie .-/here
you did actually do rhe required
action but not quite ri the correct
way and this was frustrating.
Aside from that minor quibble
the graphics are not up to today's
standard but then the game is old.
They are perfectly adequate
though, with smooth animation
and glorious animated cut scenes.
The sound is also excellent, which
includes a changing atmospheric
score, while the fully digitised
speech of all the characters,
includes the 'other' actor from
Terminator 2. So technically as
adventure games go it is on the
very good side so far.
The story briefly, is that an
army/NASA space bloke (you) goes
up in a shuttle to save the entire
world (wonderful America!). Help
comes in the form of other charac-
ters in the game, one being a
German scientist and a women
journalist. Since when have
Americans ever used German sci-
entists (Dr Strangelove ?). Well in
the end you arrive on a strange
alien planet and the object of the
game is to get back home. You
don't meet many people, in fact the
number of characters is quite low
for a game like this, comparing it to
Day of the Tentacle for example.
The good thing about this is that
you get to know the characters
much more. There is even an
implied moral about drug addic-
tion! Most enjoyable, o

BEST OF THE OLDIES
WIPEOUT 2097
Psygnosis E j J J M l
Half the games out on the
1
& market these days are just
a
sequels, it is by no means a
bad thing. The publishing
company doesn't have to think up
original names and game plot,
while the programmers have an
established game engine that does
not really require too much rework-
ing, and finally the players get more
from an enjoyable game.
Is Wipeout 2097 just another
driving game rehashed from the
original? Yes, but with new levels
and easier to control anti-gravity
vehicles, Wipeout 2097 is an
improvement and an upgrade on
the older model. Wipeout is essen-
tially a racing game, and the rules
are simple, slam on the accelera-
tor, battle against other drivers and
head for the finish.
The game is not limited to dri-
ving around the circuit and avoiding
your opponents, as an assortment
of power ups and weapons are
available to experiment on your
opponents. Some of these include
a temporary autopilot which helps
for those tricky twists and turns
and quake, which tears up race way
and sends it down the tack as a
tidal wave down towards the other
contestants. With 14 other drivers
to contend with it becomes a bit of
struggle but the added weaponry
evens the odds of winning. Each
level needs a lot of practice but
players of the original game will
find that they are familiar territory.
The first six tracks need to be
completed before proceeding to
the other hidden levels, and there
is an addictive quality about
Wipeout 2097 that makes play and
play until you have gained these 2
extra levels. 2097 reaches out to
those who like serious game play
and to those who like a thumping
soundtrack. It becomes a true
enlightening experience when the
fast moving objects and vibrant
colours blur into one another, while
the stereo sound finally locks you
into a second reality.
There are four different vehicles
to choose from varying from the
easy but slow vehicle to the fast but
impossible to control. Choose and
take control!
As with the original, the sound
tracks include some major club
names Prodigy, Chemical Brothers
and Future Sounds of London.
Unfortunately the PC version of this
game (Wipeout XL) lacks these
music tracks but with hardware
acceleration the graphics is one up
on the Sony Playstation.
Like its predecessor this is an
excellent game for all you speed
freaks out there. The current cost
of Wipeout 2097 may discourage
most buyers but search around and
you may be lucky enough to find it
second hand.
