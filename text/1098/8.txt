8 COLUMNS 14 November 1997
Doing this journalistic
lark, one gets used to
brickbats and bouquets,
particularly the former. So it was
nice to read Robert Emerson's let-
ter in last week's Felix. The man
clearly possesses exceptional
judgement and insight, but I must
reassure him and others that 1 am
not getting tame. True, it has been
a while since my image has been
decorated with pins in Sherfield
(that has happened before), but
not everyone is so enamoured
with yours truly, however. News
reaches me of comments by one
of the dBs DJs on Friday. Strangely,
I am one of the few people never
to have had a dig at the music in
the Union. Moreover, I was gyrat-
ing alongside the young people in
that very room two days before
this event. Was ever a man more
misunderstood? Still, it's nice to be
noticed. That doesn't mean it is
open season on Baker...
Investment advice is rarely
given in Felix, partly because none
of you have more than the cost of
20 Marlboro in the bank, so 'win-
ning at roulette on the Titanic1
deserves a comment. Call me a
hard-bitten old capitalist, but I
have never had much time for eth-
ical investment. If a company is
doing something particularly dicey,
even if legal, the truth will usually
out, public opinion will turn against
them, if they have a retail element,
and the share
price will fall
accordingly. In
general, compa-
nies that do
things that will
lead them to end
up with egg on
their face often
have broader
m a n a g e m e n t
inadequacies that
go beyond ethical
issues. Of course,
if you as an indi-
vidual do not like what an organi-
sation is doing, you can vote with
your feet and sell your shares or
avoid their products. Pension
funds are a different matter. Fund
managers should be out to secure
the highest rate of return within
their given risk criteria. Anything
else is unacceptable, and they

should invest accordingly. In pur-
suing this aim, many companies
will be filtered out on the basis of
financial fundamentals that may be
coincident with ethics; for exam-
ple, Tesco recently dropped kan-
garoo meat, sensing a potential
backlash from its customers that
would impact on
it share price,
before fund
managers began
selling their
stock. If I was a
member of the
USS pension
scheme, I would
be less than
happy if my fel-
low members
voted for under-
j—j. performance, as
will happen if
the managers' hands are tied. The
Government will only guarantee a
minimum pension, if things go
horribly wrong, so the notion that
it will have 'no impact' on pensions
is plainly wrong. Deciding ethical
investment guidelines is a bit like
playing God - our friends in the
Socialist Worker Party would argue
that all capitalism was immoral
and exploitative, so where does
that leave you? Still, on one point,
I am full square behind Tom Hay.
Avoid anything bearing Linda
McCarthey's signature.
Reading IC Distorter recently,
as I often do, I read something
interesting. While that's news in
itself, the matter in question con-
cerned the planned refectory for
the BMS. Someone implied that
this would be a branch of Pret a
Manger. Imagine my delight.
Naturally suspicious, 1 phoned my
friend Ian Caldwell, fresh from his
holiday in South Africa, to check it
out. Sadly, someone's been
embroidering the facts, behaviour
we deplore at Felix. It seems the
design will look like a Pret a
Manger branch, but no operator
has yet been found. This is a gold-
en opportunity to raise the stan-
dards of catering here. Be fearless,
lan.
