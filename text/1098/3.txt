PHASERS SET TO RAG M A G
STUN BEYOND A JOKE
American inventor Jan Eric Herr
has developed a weapon with
effects that parallel those of sci-fi
laser guns. Mr. Herr's weapon
works on a similar principle to
tasers, hand-held 'defence'
weapons that deliver a high volt-
age shock to the victim. It
employs 2 lasers to create a 'plas-
ma channel,' a column of ionised
air which electricity can flow
through. Then an electrical cur-
rent, is sent through the target.
This has the effect of painlessly
stunning the victim - or worse -
depending on the setting of the
gun. Using lasers also increases
the range of these weapons from
five to around one hundred
metres.
The one major drawback at the
moment is the weapon's large
size. As technology progresses
however, the components are cer-
tainly going to get smaller. Prof.
Anthony Bell, from Imperial's plas-
ma physics research group,
agreed that a portable weapon
could not be ruled out in the near
future. He added that he was dis-
tressed that plasma physics could
be turned to such applications.
Rag's annual humourous fund-
raising magazine, the rag mag, has
this year recieved heavy critisism
from Union officers due to several
of the jokes contained being unac-
ceptably racist or homophobic.
Andy Heeps, ICU President, told
Felix that it was "exceptionally
inappropriate" and the magazine
could not be sold unless three of
the jokes were deleted. The matter
will be discussed at the union
executive committee on Tuesday,
and no copies are allowed to be
sold off campus until then, as it is
possible that legal action could be
taken against Rag. This has also
prevented Rag from selling them in
their London collection planned for
Tuesday morning.
Concerns have also been
voiced that the mag will fail to raise
any money, as the cover price is
only ten pence above the produc-
tion costs, and no advertising was
sought.
Due to Rag's innactivity over
the summer, The Royal College of
Science Union have also released a
rag mag which has so far escaped
the censor's pen. Both mags will
be availiable at all rag events.

The London Church of Christ:
righteous religion or creepy congregation?
The London Church of Christ (LCC)
is one of a number of groups in this
country that form part of an organ-
isation currently known as the
International Churches of Christ,
also referred to as the Boston
Movement. This year the LCC have
been trying with a new fervour to
persuade IC students to join them.
The LCC considers itself a
Christian church, taking the New
Testament as its basis; however,
some evangelical bodies have
repudiated some of their doctrines.
Every new member of the LCC is
placed under the wing of a disciple
who exercises a close degree of
supervision both spiritually and
socially. Although the disciples are
enthusiastic and sincere, their
youth and inexperience renders
some of them unqualified to help
those seeking guidance.
Membership of the LCC
involves a level of time commit-
ment far in excess of that expected
by most mainstream Churches, and
a considerable amount of effort in
recruiting new members. The lead-
ers make it clear that no friend ,
parent, or job can be more impor-
tant than work for the LCC. The
LCC's membership (now just over
500) is predominantly young; well
over half are in their 20s or late
teens, and a significant proportion
of the members are students.
The LCC's refusal to accept
criticism from other Christian
groups and society in general has
created a hostile relationship. The
LCC considers its interpretation of
scripture as exclusively correct,
making discussions between them
and evangelical bodies impossible.
The authoritarian structure of the
LCC and the pressure they exert on
their members has led to many
complaints, especially as the latter
of these tends to cause students to
do badly in examinations. Leaders
deny that anything other than
"strong advice" is given and do not
believe that the pressure on mem-
bers is excessive. They also main-
tain that it is their right to be
concerned for the whole life of
their members.
LCC meetings have been
banned from college premises,
though it has been reported that
they are still going ahead in
unknown locations around cam-
pus. The college chaplaincy has
expressed some concern about the
LCC doctrines, the tight stronghold
they have on student members,
and the way they monopolise
members' time.
