ICFCII St GEORGE'S ICFC V v St BART'S II
We had it all planned before the
game: let them take the lead to
tempt them into a false sense of
security, and then wipe the floor
with them. Things went even bet-
ter than we had planned - we
appeared flaccid in all depart-
ments, and gave them a com-
manding lead of two-nil. Dan
helped one of their midfielders to
the ground after being tackled nas-
tily from behind, but James the ref
let them both off with yellow
cards. We appeared incompetent
and frustrated, with an inability to
finish anything off up front: they
had fallen perfectly into our trap.
Within five minutes of the start
of the second half, the worm
turned. Felix slammed home a tan-
talising cross from Pete, and the
floodgates opened. Our midfield
came alive and ran rings around
George's, sweeping forward and
giving the George's keeper the
heebie-jeebies. Penetrating runs
from the centre of the pitch gave
Steve his chance to put one away
from the edge of the box, which he
did with aplomb. Tony followed
suit, leaving their keeper flounder-
ing as the ball rippled the side-net-
ting. Our destruction of the enemy
was complete when Steve struck
again from just inside the area. An
attack of nerves struck our for-
wards, neither of whom managed
to score. If Martin's goal drought
doesn't end soon, we may have to
hire a psychotherapist....
A commanding second half
performance, despite five regulars
being absent, shows that Dan's
army continues to march forward,
taking no prisoners.
Tragically, captain Dan was
taken to hospital during training
with suspected ankle ligament
damage. Get well soon, Dan.
ICFC II 4 - 2 St George's I
12:30 on Saturday and IC fifths
had a rather pathetic turnout of six
players and Jimmy (captain) was
looking concerned. But by one
o'clock we had 10 fifth team play-
ers and a random borrowed from
the sixths squad. IC started badly
and rapidly conceded two goals,
blaming them on the wind, bright
sun and general bad luck. But the
fifths' fighting spirit showed
through and the tide started to
turn our way. With half time loom-
ing Kublai was put through on the
left. Fighting off a challenge from a
defender and with the keeper
running out to dive at his feet
Kublai struck the ball over the
keeper and just inside the left post
to put IC back in the match.
In the second half Barts were
beginning to get frustrated and
playing dirty, but the fifths' gave as
good as they got and play raged
from one end to the other.
Staunch defending from Nick,
Mark, Dan and especially Malcolm,
aided by a hard working defence
kept Barts from scoring and before
long Kublai got the equaliser in a
goal mouth scramble. Both teams
were now getting closer and closer
to scoring a winner with only light-
ening fast reflexes of the keepers
and defenders clearing the ball off
the line keeping the score level.
Neil could have scored but for an
unbelievable save from their keep-
er and jimmy managed to stop
two Barts shots that looked certain
to score. The fast pace was
upheld right up to the end of the
match but at the whistle the result
was a draw, testimony to a very
closely balanced, exciting match.
The fifths showed their excellent
character and spirit in coming back
for a draw, and are now doing well
in their league.
ICFC V 2 - 2 SBLH II
St BART'S III v ICFC VI
Following an (unpublicised) 1 2 - 0
victory over St George's 111, the
team went into this match brim-
ming with confidence. Starting the
match off with our usual long ball
tactics (well, we are the 6th team),
resulted in a superbly executed
run-away goal from Banksy. Voices
were heard in the IC team suggest-
ing a possible 13-0 win. These
comments proved a bit optimistic.
In spite of our technical superi-
ority, St Bart's tactics of fouls,
intimidation and violence 'earned'
them a 2-1 victory. Training this
week will be three hours of
unarmed combat techniques
(taken by Chirag).

Shooting
stars
On Saturday, 8 November, ICRPCs
first clay pigeon shooting expedi-
tion of the year took place.
Nineteen members, many of whom
had never before shot clays
the coveted ICRPC wooden spoon
for the second year running, thanks
to his special TATACEAP ( Throw A
Tantrum And Call Everyone A p**f)
training programme. Anonymous
IC shooters display their limp weapons just after shooting their load
travelled to Hawley to enjoy a full
day's shooting. Scores varied from
embarrassingly low to infuriatingly
good, with particularly good shoot-
ing from Ed and Rupert (bit of a
surprise there). Rupert had the
opportunity to use his new Merkel
shotgun, It performed remarkably
well. Especially considering that he
got it for Â£ 15 from some bloke he
met down the pub and it only has a
three inch, sawn off barrel. Markos
Dakalakalakapopoudop oulos won
quote of the trip: "The trouble with
M is that he's simply not
British". All participants had a
splendid time, despite the odd
bruised shoulder. Ask them if you
don't believe me. Anyone wanting
to join the next trip on Saturday 18
November should come and see us
at the Shooting Range in the IC
Sports Centre on Wednesday after-
noon or Saturday from 1 1 in the
morning. Everyone is welcome,
regardless of previous experience.
It's grim up North
for hardy cyclists
On Saturday 25th October, 3
members of the cycling club left
the smoggy air of London and
headed for Derbyshire to take part
in the BUSA hill climb tree trial
champs. Arriving early, Kimbal,
Tarik and Rob drove up the course.
As the car struggled up the gradi-
ent, the trio were struck by a sud-
den feeling of terror and a realiza-
tion that their bikes were
overgeared. The climb was well
over a mile long and rose over
200m. Kimbal was the first off and
despite pulling his foot out of the
pedal half way up, set a competi-
tive time. Rob was next to go and
was thankful for a light bike as
being one of the heaviest of the
field put him at a disadvantage. A
valiant effort saw Rob complete the
climb in a respectable time. Last off
was Tarik. His tactic of taking the
first half steadily and sprinting the
second soon went out of the win-
dow as he discovered that the
climb was a real challenge from the
word go. Tarik crossed the finish in
7:00 minutes, 15 seconds slower
that Kimbal whose time placed him
in the top third of the field. After a
complimentary pint in the pub, the
three headed for home. Anyone
interested in training and compet-
ing for the club, contact t.djed-
dour@ic.ac.uk.
