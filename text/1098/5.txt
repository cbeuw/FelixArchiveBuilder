RADIO FEEDBACK
Dear Felix
1 was sad to read the attitudes
of Jeremy Thompson and presiden-
tial candidates to the
Hammersmith campus of ICSM
this week. Mark Baker was asked
on IC radio if he knew our address
- which he didn't, and was congrat-
ulated on this.
True, Hammersmith hospital is
located in the wastes of East Acton
(the kind of area you only visit to
make you feel smug that you live
somewhere else), but this attitude
is unhelpful to say the least. No
candidate has sent any election
material to our campus, which has
as a result been only dimly aware
of the IC elections. One of the
potential problems of the merger
which formed ICSM was the isola-
tion of campuses like our own from
the South Ken campus, which
appears to be occurring and should
be resisted.
I would threaten a massive
block vote against Mark, but we
don't have enough students to
make a difference, and none of
them have the faintest idea who he
is anyway! 1 hope to see the
Hammersmith treated a little better
in future issues.
Yours Bill Hanage
President ICSM Hammersmith
Postgrad Association
I had no intention of congratulat-
ing Mark on his lack of knowledge
of the medical campuses (Radio
Interviews, Felix 1097). True, I
said "Good", but this was
because I'd manage to catch him
out on a question. Sorry to any-
one who got the wrong end of the
stick. Ed.
Dear Felix,
Just a little word on a comment
made by Charlie Joynt in last issue's
radio interview. It concerns his
either misunderstanding, or skillful
dodging of the question concern-
ing the situation of the Christian
Union official status refusal by the
Union. Not to be a pedant on a
past issue, as a representative from
the committee that applied for
membership (which was about two
years ago now) 1 would like to clar-
ify the situation. The Christian
Union, does and always will accept
ANY person, whatever belief, as a
member. In fact we encourage it
and have discussion groups called
"Discovering Christianity" specifi-
cally for those who just have an
interest and just want to find out
for themselves what Christians
really claim.
Formerly, members had to sign
a very short statement of faith, but
since no membership was paid,
whether they were members or
was irrelevant (and still is), and no
special attention was paid to mem-
bers. To enter the Union the C.U.
was prepared to compromise on
this issue, no longer requiring this
statement of faith. We were not,
however, prepared to remove the
requirement of our committee to
sign a longer statement of faith
(produced by UCCF - The
Universities and Colleges Christian
Fellowship - an umbrella organisa-
tion which supports all the univer-
sity C.U.s around the country).
Don't misunderstand that I am
against the union's ruling. Formerly
of this college, I was very glad to
be in a union with such a strong
stance on Equal Opportunities (and
without being too PC also). We
understood completely why the
Union would not compromise, and
accepted that. A warning however:
need I remind you how, in this col-
lege of Equal Rights and
Opportunities, the gay society
prior to IQ was shut down? Or is
that just a myth to frighten little
societies that open their mouth too
much? The reason perhaps, why IQ
kept such a low profile in it's first
year (joined the Union beginning of
1995). For those readers who
haven't heard the story : the rugby
club decided to join the gay soci-
ety, call an AGM, vote themselves
on committee and shut the society
down. With overwhelming num-
bers, by the Union's constitution of
any person having the right to be
accepted into any society AND
their committee (by a majority
vote), any small but outspoken
group is in danger of this.
This would never happen
today? So why has the Mary's block
vote had such power over any elec-
tion or college-wide vote? Not the
same at all, you might say; but isn't
that a group of determined out-
siders (who have different goals,
and don't understand the ethos of
the Union) trying to get their own
way and often being a thorn in the
side of the Union? Incidents of
Mary's students overwhelming
AGM's springs to mind. (Apologise
for any offence taken by Mary's,
the Rugby Club, or IQ).
Yours Sincerely
Smiley
P.S. May I just say what a vile
colour the front of Felix has
become.
FELIX CRAP
Dear Felix,
In light of last week's issue, I
feel that this whole "Felix is shite"
thing needs to be cleared up. I'm
glad that Jeremy Thomson had
both the maturity and sense to
admit that things arn't going quite a
smoothly as planned. I'm glad I'm
not the only person who feels that
the standards have slipped.
Equally, though, there has been a
marked difference in last week's
issue (#1097). The orange tiger on
the front cover looks remarkable
impressive, it'd be great if that
were the regular look of Felix. Dare
I say it, but it almost looks profes-
sional. Things just get better
though, the improvements are not
restricted to aesthetics. Felix even
has (gasp) a real news story on the
front cover.
I feel that it is an outrage
(shock; horror; someone actually
voicing a i opinion about some-
thing serious at Imperial!) that the
tuition fees issue had been allowed
to go this far. 1 think it's about time
someone realised that apathy isn't
the virtue the Union (and even the
College) prescribes it to be.
Obviously, this isn't the same situ-
ation, but one of the reasons for
the rise of fascism in 30s Germany
was basically because of apathy
with no-one being prepared to do
anything. Obviously, genocide is a
bit more serious than a few thou-
sand quid but the principle holds.
The Union, and College in general,
seem to pride themselves on being
apathetic (and to a lesser degree
conformist), when will they realise
that these are qualities to be
ashamed of? When will all the stu-
dents here wake up and realise that
