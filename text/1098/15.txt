CLUBSCENE - COMPILATIONS
BEATS BY DOPE DEMAND
Vol. 4
B
eats by Dope Demand have
been going for a while now,
and this their latest offering
is no disappointment. If you liked
the first three in this series you'll
love this one. This compilation is
packed full of quality tunes, ranging
from laid back downbeat tracks like
Tim Love Lee's Starplay 69, with
it's strong use of atmosphericals
and a more musical feel to it, to
big-beat bass-line stompers like
Fatboy Slim Vs Bassbin Twins,
Aaaw Shut up, this gradually builds
up to a rocking big-beat style then
suddenly it's all striped away and a
massive BASS-line takes-over, oh
yes. This track definitely means
business, it Just gets fatter and fat-
ter as it goes on. One of my
favourite tunes on this compilation
is Environmental Science's,
Nonsense Pt.3. This starts off with
some spacey sounds, then comes
in a slow downbeat break. When
you least expect it, it picks up to a
drum &xbass speed, with firing high
hats, snares and bass-drums.
Cleverly done and very useful in the
bridging the gap between break-
beat and drum &. bass, for those of

Freebass - Oxygen * * *
(Freeflow records)
This first release from the new Free
Flow label has strong musical
atmosphericals behind a more
breakbeat-driven track. This is a
nice break from the big bassline
jump-up style that is mainly around
at the moment. Both this and the
flipside have a definite old school
feel to them. For those of you who
like something a bit different this is
a must-have track. Out 1 Oth Nov.
Eskovah - Night &. Day/ Tramp
* * * * *
(Colour Stone Records )
This is one of those tracks that
seems to work its way back onto
your decks every time you go on
them. Night &. Day starts off with
metallic-sounding beats and an
excellent large female vocal 7 com-
ing home now baby, that doesn't
sound out of place at all, in this
dark grinding steeper. This is drum
&. bass at its innovative best. The
flip-side has a slightly darker feel
and no major lyric and overall this
single breaks the mould and re-sets
it in it's own form. Out now.
The Prisoners of Technology -
The Trick of Technology * * * *
(Fresh Kutts Records)
This is a truly massive tune, every-
time i have heard this played out,
the place blows up and goes crazy.
This is by no means just another
jump up bassline monster. It is full
of fresh beats and nice twists here
and there, more than enough to
keep you interested. Then comes
the breakdown with an excellent
big sample. Then it comes back at
you with that funky fresh bassline.
If this doesn't get you brocking out
nothing will. Out now.
Mulder - Don't Believe The Hype
* * * *
(Urban Takeover )
This one seems to have been
around for ages blowing up clubs
up and down the country for what
seems like years, and final it's been
released. With it's unforgettable
'Don't believe the hype' sample
and time stretched like nobody's
business and fat beats and bassline
this is a must have for all junglists.
Out now.
you who like to play a more diverse
set. Another track that crosses
boarders nicely is Mr Dan's Snorkel
Starting off with some nice Electro
sounds and a slow downbeat
break, then drops the fat chopping
beats and breaks. This one will
have your head nodding along
before you know it. There's also
crazy break-beat action with the
likes of Terminal Head's Coma
Nova, and for those of you who like
it a bit darker and deeper there
Dust Devil's Hooligan. Elite Force's
Cool Like the Man has a definite
Hip-Hop crossed with Electro feel
to it, with good depth of sounds,
this tune certainly is cool like the
man. Jep Beat Collective's Attack of
the Wildstyle Beatfreak, lives up to
it's name, again a nice mix of
Electro beats with those freaky
beats. I particular liked the scratch-
ing on this one, nicely done, with
the memorable Back By Dope
Demand sample, this is another
top-quality track.
So all in all this is very strong
compilation, I didn't find a weak
track on it. The first time I listened
to this compilation I thought it was
good, but after a couple more lis-
tens I realised I had been wrong:
it's fucking excellent. Each track
can easily stand alone on it's own
merits, there are no cheesy fillers
on this compilation. Beats By Dope
Demand vol.4 is a very useful set of
tracks that all big-beat, downbeat
and break-beat lovers/DJ's should
have in their record box.
This compilation is available in
a DJ-friendly triple vinyl or for those
of you who prefer CDs, it's excel-
lently mixed by Slinky Merlinky,
who incidentally compiled the track
for this compilation. No wonder
there so many storming tracks on
this one really, with the wealth of
knowledge and taste that Slinky
clearly has. Slinky is the label man-
ager at SRD covering funnily
enough big-beat, downbeat and
break-beat, I can see why. To check
the man live and direct get your-
selves down 'MARS' W l nearest
tube Tottenham Court Rd, where
he co-promotes 'Underclass' every
Thursday. E

RuffDriverz * * * *
(Undisputed Records)
This debut release from the Essex
based label is a real stormer. It
starts off with the time stretched
Don't Stop vocal, then comes the
driving bass drum, I can see why
this tune is being described in some
circles as speed house, due to the
similar use of the bassline. I think
this could be the start of a new sub-
section of dance music, with Ruff
Driverz leading the way. Out now.
Tailspin - All Massive * * * *
(Speedfreak Records )
The first offering from this label
starts off with that typical 'Speed
Garage' style (to coin a phrase).
With fat beats and All A1ass;Ve
vocal, then it drops into a lush
breakdown, and a quite superb
male vocal ' when your feeling lone-
ly and you need a friend, reach out
for my love, on it you can depend
gradually building to a absolutely
wicked echoing bassline. The more
I hear this track the more I like it.
Out 1 7th Nov.
N19 Recordings - Ganjaman
++++
(Stone City)
This wicked tune from the newly
established N 1 9 label is again
pushing the boundaries of
house/garage music one step fur-
ther. With the excellent use of time
stretches and reverse beats, with a
fat, fat stomping bassline. With a
strong breakdown and 'Ganjaman'
sample this is a must have floor
filler. Out now.
Way Out West - Ajare * * * *
(DeconstructionRecords)
This track has been re-released
after three years, and has some
new mixes to bring it up to date,
my favourite being the Way Out
West mix. This one gets straight
down to business with a driven
beats and eerie lyrics, with a nice
use of scratching. This will be big
on the trancey house scene, no
doubt about it. With stabbings of
break-beat to keep you interested.
A nice and diverse track well worth
a listen. Out 17th Nov. Also look
out for their album out now. LTLCl
