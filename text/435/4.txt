Ins and outs of the WELFARE
Rent Act
The Rent A c t i s often cited as the
reason for the shortage of accommodation
in London. It was introduced to give more
rights to the tenant, but does it help you?
There are different c l a s s e s under the
A c t , such a s resident and non-resident
landlords. F i r s t l y , I w i l l consider the
c a s e where you have a resident landlord.
A s they are resident they take advantage
of a s p e c i a l dispensation in the A c t
which removes your right to security of
tenure unless the accommodation is a
purpose built block of flats when t h e
exemption does not necessarily apply. A
lodger or tenant with a resident landlord
has the right to have a rent fixed by a
Rent Tribunal unless you have food
provided and this forms a substantial
part of the rent.
If you have a non-resident landlord it
is probable that you have a
_ regulated
tenancy. However there are, of course,
exemptions such as H a l l s of R e s i d e n c e .
Regulated tenants have security of
tenure and the rents are subject to Rent
regulation, whether the property be
furnished or unfurnished. A s a tenant you
have security of tenure even when your
tenancy expires; y o u do not have t o
leave unless the courts grant a n order
of p o s s e s s i o n against y o u .
Unfortunately the Act is slightly vague
s o each c a s e has to be taken' on its own
merits; if you have any problems with
your accommodation please contact the
Welfare Centre, 3rd F l o o r , of the U n i o n
B u i l d i n g .

three w h i c h I should like to correct:
(i) The C o l l e g e ' R e f e c t o r y Committee

Suicide discussion evening
Nigntline and the U n i o n Welfare are
combining to organise a d i s c u s s i o n on
Suicide. Suicide i s a subject normally
talked about i n embarrassed, hushed
whispers. It i s a problem of our present
society and understanding it .goes a long
way to its cure.
There i s going to be an open meeting
titled ' S u i c i d e , t o do or not to do.' o n
Wednesday December 1st at 19.00 hours
in Mech E n g 220. The d i s c u s s i o n w i l l
be led by Jean Burt, the joint General
Secretary of the Samaritans.
It i s hoped that the evening w i l l
remove many of the myths surrounding
s u i c i d e . It i s a l s o hoped that you w i l l
become aware of the problem and how
you can a s s i s t .

(ii) In the overseas- students article it

welcomed by me, they were suggested by
me after a paper given t o me by P e t e

(iii) In the misinformed tome from Steve
Williams concerning the Discount C a r d
scheme he says " w e w i l l be unable to
s e l l our cards to the students from our
college because they w i l l just go to
I m p e r i a l " . What a load of b u l l , because
we agreed quite e x p l i c i t y that we would
only s e l l the cards to members of I C U
and no other c o l l e g e s .

ORANGE
MOLE
by IC Union
Deputy President
Derrick Everett
There have recently been
a number of incidents where
students have conducted
themselves 1n a less than
commendablefashion. Increased
rowdiness in Stan's bar is a
matter on which many people
have commented, and seems
mostly to involve individuals
banned from the Union bar.
Further to this, let me
remind you that being on the
Union roof, without permission
from myself, i s a d i s c i p l i n a r y
offence, and drinking parties
on the roof are most definitely
not on.
