L a n c a s t e r ' s lead inopposing
the Government's proposed
rise i n tuition fees for 1977
(see last w e e k ' s Student
World) has been followed this

amption artd L e i c e s t e r , and

T.U. Bid Fails
Aberystwyth's Court last
week voted overwhelmingly
against the b i d to put four
T U C representatives on i t s
'security c o u n c i l ' (see last
w e e k ' s Student World), but
Sir T u c may s t i l l be admitted
to the 200 strong court of
K i n g Aber.
The Foreign Quarter
F o u r o f the five London
polytechnics have defended
the giving of quarter (of their
p l a c e s ) to the 'foreign quarter'
by defying a n I L E A directive
to keep their overseas student
numbers at the same level as
last year.
They are the P o l y t e c h n i c of
North London, the C i t y of
London P o l y t e c h n i c , Central
London P o l y t e c h n i c , and the
P o l y t e c h n i c of the South B a n k .
T h e only dissident i s T h a m e s .
The aim of the directive -is to
reduce overseas numbers from
25% to 10% by 1982 - that i s ,
from 8,400 to 3,400.
Contrary to the directive,
P N L has increased i t s over-
seas intake by 50, P C L by 4 6 ,
and there have been comparable
increases at C i t y and South
Bank.
Defending the defiance,
Professor Yarwood of P C L
said he regarded the education
of overseas students a s a
s u b s t a n t i a l contribution to the
overseas a i d programme.

Bad tempers
and excitement
London School of Economics 12 : 22 IC
Imperial C o l l e g e went to
N e w Maiden on Wednesday to
take on the L S E l s t X V a n d
continue fheir fine f o r m , of
recent w e e k s . It was a game
full of incident and excitement
and one which, s a w some
spirited rugby from both s i d e s .
L S E were delighted to score
two tries within fifteen minutes.
The first came from their right
winger, who beat the defence
with some elusive running
and the second followed good
support work that created an
overlap on the left. Both were
converted.
IC strike back
Ic rallied and were rewarded
by a beautifully struck
penalty from Cotter. T w o
minutes later the forwards
worked the b a l l back from a
maul and Gibbs unselfishly
put Gregory in for a try.
The game at this stage was
open and fluid, with some
commendable tackling a n d
covering.
Later on a spate of good
line-out play enabled R o b i n s
and Turely to take the ball to
within a yard of the line. T h e
ensuing ruck w a s fast and
ferocious. The L S E back row
tried to k i l l the b a l l , but the
half-backs were able to
handle quickly and enabled
Gilbert dive over for h i s first
score of the season.
Instead of consolidating
their position, I C lost con-
centration, something which
has caused problems in the
past, a n d the 1 lead w a s
snatched away from them as
L S E scored a try on the
stroke of half time.
After the interval Robins —
troubled by an ankle injury —
was forced to leave the f i e l d .
T h i s , and some extraordinary
decisions — or rather lack of
them — concerning infringe-
ments at both ruck and maul,
introduced a degree- of frust-
ration into the game. Several
punches were thrown and much
of the play w a s bad-tempered
during this period.
Marching Orders
Matters came to a head,
however, when the I C 2nd row
Steve A s p d e n , was seen raking
an L S E player at a rcuk. H i s
instant d i s m i s s a l to the
dressing room made him the
first Imperial C o l l e g e l s t X V
player to be sent off i n five
years.
The final thirty minutes
were an enormous test of
character for the team. T h e
forwards drove themselves a n d
fought for every b a l l , contest-
ing both scrummage and line-
out, with c o n v i c t i o n . Having
withstood intense pressure, I C
broke out of defence and from
a badly mis-cued 25 yard
drop out Heath chipped ahead,
Gibbs gathered the ball and
Gregory fought through a
tackle and squeezed over i n
the corner for a tremendous
try.
T h i s w a s truly the turning
point of the game, it encouraged
the pack to battle o n , and
Cotter k i c k e d another penalty
before further pressure on the
L S E line produced a try for
West on the left wing. T h e
final whistle w a s blown
immediately after the conver-
sion attempt faded past the
left hand upright,
Earned reputation
In winning by 22—12 I C
have provided themselves with
the platform needed for the
fixtures to come against some
of the best club sides i n
London. They showed a
measure of the fire a n d
motivation, too, which has
earned the rugby club a
reputation a s one of the top
teams in the U n i v e r s i t y .

IC F e n c i n g C l u b ' s first
match this season was against
K i n g s who reputedly have a
very strong team.
After a slight disagreement
about the definition of a
beginner — our beginners
being more experienced than
theirs — our teams got off to
a good start, holding their
ground w e l l against a very
strong s i d e . S p e c i a l mention
must be made of Andy Meusch
whose refreshingly unusual
tactics proved effective against
fencers who had been drilled
in orthodox methods. Similar
tactics proved to be effective
at E p e e .
"Hie final score, apart from
the excellent performance of
the Sabre -team, does not look
too promising until one
