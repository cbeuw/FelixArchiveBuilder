Rag Week-
F E L I X , N O V E M B E R 19th 1 9 7 6 - 5
Friday - Guilds Carnival
Always one of the highlights of IC Rag Week is the Guilds
All Night Carnival, this year scheduled for Friday, 26th
November.
Last year's extravaganza featured the whimsical talents of
the drunken Viv Stanshall, Rodger Ruskin Spear and Andy
'Thunderclap' Newman.
This year the Guilds Ents Committee have chosen a line-up
of artists that give the event a more rock oriented feel. Head-
lining the bill will be top Welsh band Sassafras. After gigging
up and down the country at clubs, colleges and supporting
major rock acts at top venues, the band have now earned a
strong, healthy following. The present line-up is Terry Bennett,
Ricky John Holt, Dai Shell, Ralph Evans and Bob 'Congo'
Jones.
They have maintained their base in Cardiff where they
began with Dai and Ralph — a long-standing guitar playing
partnership — who teamed up with bass player Ricky John and
former Love Sculpture drummer Congo Jones. They worked
for a year, split up, and then reformed in ' 7 3 , adding Bennett
to their line-up.
Although basically a hard-hitting rock band, Sassafras have
been influenced by the West Coast sound, and distinct refer-
ences to the country bands like the Burritos and Eagles can be
heard in their music. Certainly a band that you shouldn't miss.
Supporting Sassafras will be folk singer Alan White and
rock band the Foster Brothers. I must admit I know little of the
talents of Mr. White. However, I can tell you that the Foster
Brothers are a raunchy goodtime band, that have been playing
the London pub circuit for a long time under the name of
Blitz. They are now concentrating more on Colleges and small
halls.
There will also be a disco on throughout the evening.
As a contrast to the live music, two films will be shown
during the evening. They are the brilliant 'Loot', and the much
acclaimed Take the Money and Run', both of which should
prove excellent entertainment.
To round things off, food will be provided throughout the
evening and most important of all the Union Bar and Lounge
will be serving drink until 3 a.m.!
All this and more can be enjoyed at the very reasonable
price of £ 1 . 9 0 in advance (from C & G Union Office) or £ 2 . 2 0
on the door. Everyone is welcome to join in the festivities, so
why not go along and enjoy yourselves.

Thursday - Smoking
Concert
Lock up your daughters, 'cause this Thursday sees the
annual RCS Smoking Concert. In blunt terms it is 'a smutty
version of what a college revue should be' (John White) i.e. 3
hours of filth, obscenity and bawdy wit(?). In fact it is so good
that even Miners and Guildspersons pay 50p to get in.
So much for the promo; I can't tell you much more 'cause
the bulk of the sketches are written the night before, a fact
that greatly enhances the literary content of the show.
As you will have gathered from the graphic pictures in the
RCS Handbook(?), Smoking Concert is the students' chance to
get their own back on the lecturers, throw mud at the
Executive (all 4 of them?—Ed) and relieve thier sexual
frustrations.
If you are in RCS then act in your year sketch, it's great
fun and a free barrel goes to the winners. If you are in Mines
or Guilds then come and watch you own execs., in their guest
sketches. (Quite honestly — I think you'll — Mines and Guilds
that is — be more turned on by the stripper or drag artist . . .
depending on your fancy of course!)
