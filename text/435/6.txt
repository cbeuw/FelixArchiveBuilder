or the fun and frolics of Rag Week
The 1975 RCS Rag procession float
Rag week is nearly upon us again. This is
the one week in the year when you can forget
about the lectures and problem sheets (if you
haven't already) and indulge in some never
to be forgotten experiences. So make the most
of it!
It would be unfair to say Rag week is
characterised by the frequency with which
people take their clothes off but if the trends
set last year continue — unlikely since
Paul Korowski's cancelled his streak — we
could be in tor some interesting sights.
Have a good time, spend lots of money
(please) and remember its all iq aid of
Cancer Research and Kensington Emperors
Swimming Pool for the Disabled.
