Thesis going cheap...only £170 ICWA
I just knew that I should not have
mentioned sentence shuffling in my
previous literary masterpiece. No sooner
had the words been lovingly coerced
from this relic of a typewriter, than the
editor and h i s subordinates ruthlessly
mutilated this onslaught. Just to be o n
the safe side this is paragraph one.
And s o to para two. Doubtless every-
one h a s been harassing Mr Dewey t o
ask him where the world famous P G
piece was last week; (strangely no — Ed)
well you can let him up now. My type-
writer is back from its five thousand
mistake s e r v i c e , s o I can tell you what's
"been happening. A very reduced P G
committee met a couple of weeks a g o ,
despite its s i z e , useful d i s c u s s i o n
ensued helped along by a drop of sherry.
One amazing fact which I was able
to bring to the notice of the committee
was a rough figure for the cost of
producing a thesis for P h D work. T h i s
comes to around £170, although c o n -
siderable fluctuations c a n be expected
depending on s i z e and content. I rang
the N E R C , at their request, to give them
this figure and took the opportunity to
ask their views on this matter.
Faceless excuse
The f a c e l e s s voice at the other end
told me that the official view was that
a proportion of the cost w a s secreted
in the maintainance grant each year
and the student was supposed to save
this up. When asked if he believed this
the voice sounded less than c o n v i n c e d .
I went on to suggest that the amount
ought to be reclaimable in the same way
as travel expenditure. The voice noted
this with the telephonic equivalent of
interest, and went off to refer the matter
to h i s committee. I intend to make
similar suggestions to the S R C and
D E S . Meanwhile I shall be looking into
other ways of aleviating this burden
within C o l l e g e .
Social evening going cheap
The other important matter arising
from the meeting w a s that a s o c i a l
event should be held on the evening of
the 25th of November, that's a Thursday.
It w i l l take the form of a cheese and
wine evening costing only 75p a ticket
and starting at 6.45pm. The venue is a s
not yet fixed, but watch for posters f o r
further d e t a i l s . T i c k e t s should be
available soon from our departmental
contacts. It is hoped to provide a d i s c o
and a bar.
My Public Service bit
One disturbing thing about IC i s just
how easy it is for someone to walk i n
and steal things. Obviously we don't
want security c h e c k s on a l l entrances
so i t ' s up to us to watch out and be
s e n s i b l e . The thefts involve masses of
personal belongings and money belonging
to students a s well a s office and lab
equipment. Several simple things c a n
be done to reduce these thefts; 1) Never
leave cheque books, cash, or credit
cards in your office, except in locked
drawers or cupboards; 2) Whenever
possible lock a l l labs and offices when
they are unattended even if only for a
few minutes; 3) Lock away a l l small
pieces of valuable equipment when not
in use (cameras, calculators, etc). When
in u s e ensure that calculators are i n
locked bench frames. 4) Question anyone
that y o u are not familiar with w h o is
wandering in or near your lab or office
area.
I hops that we can thus reduce t h e
cost and inconvenience of thefts both
to the c o l l e g e and individuals.
And thus in fact ends the a r t i c l e .
U L U P G Committee will be d i s c u s s i n g
the effects of the proposed fee increases
on London P G s and I shall be reporting
on this soon. In tfie meantime don't
forget to watch out for more details of
the great P G Party.

P G Affairs Officer
Since there has been a lack of
support and a number of complaints
about the difficulty of the treasure hunt
I'll give a further (and final) hint that
the capital in question i s not e s c u d o e s
...I w i l l allow a further weeks grace
for answers. Anybody who has sent i n
an answer and now feels it may be
incorrect, can send in a second attempt.
However, the second answer will be
counted (even if the first answer had
been rightjL
The second c l u e i s : -
Men and Women showing reverence to
superiors or the English Archers at
Agin Court perhaps.
The answers to both c l u e s (and 20p)
to reach room 98 Beit H a l l by Thurs
(25th) by lunchtime.
I feel I should point out that the first
three c l u e s are to help find the treasure
for which the "treasure hunt" clue w i l l
be the fourth and final one. Good luck to
a l l who enter.
Congratualtions to a l l our newly
elected committee:-
Madeleine Scott — H o n . S e c .
PadU ne Day — Treasurer
E i l e e n M c A u l i f f e - L i f e Sciences Rep.
Arlene Frances — Mines Rep
At present the only contested post is
of Mr ICWA and elections for him w i l l
take place later today.
Despite rumours to the contrary there
is definately going to be a Easter B a l l '
and it should be quite a bit cheaper than
any other B a l l s ! ! ! ICWA w i l l a l s o b e
having a Christmas luncheon on T u e s
14th Dec which should be quite a festive
event; but more details later.

How much is YOUR company losing?
Hugh Barrett looks at the NUS service companies
A n important point to bear in mind
when d i s c u s s i n g NUS Services is that
they are our s e r v i c e s who, through NUS
conference, are accountable to us.
Travel
NUS Travel (NUST) have had cont
siderable difficulties over the last few
years, e s s e n t i a l l y due to a lack of
c a p i t a l . Last year _they lost almost
£300,000 (on a £6.5M turnover) and are
set to lose over £100,000 this year.
Drastic economies and other measures
have had to be introduced to combat
these l o s s e s , v i z 35 redundancies and
the introduction of a new top managment
team. T h e s e measures w i l l hopefuly
produce a breakeven situation in two
years time, and an opportunity to pay
off the accumulated deficit over the
following years.
NUS w i l l not pay any of its income
from subscriptions to any s e r v i c e
company, s o c a s h , to tide N U S T over
this period, has been injected from a n
outside concern , the A u s t r a l i a n N U S T .
Endsleigh Insurance is in a much
healthier financial position; estimated
profits this year w i l l be around £150,000.
The bulk of this stems from the great
s u c c e s s of the 6-month c a r insurance
scheme. T h i s accounts for 45% of E n d -
s l e i g h ' s income. E n d s l e i g h are helping
N U S in their financial difficulties by
purchasing their tax losses. So, instead
of paying corporation tax to the Govern-
ment, Endsleigh are putting money into
N U S T . A rather cute accounting fiddle
I think!
Printing
Endsleigh Printing (Photomech and
Uniprint) are also in financial trouble
for basicaly the same reasons as travel.
They have a projected combined loss of
£72,000. Steps are being taken to
remedy this and I think that they are
suceeding.
A cloud on the horizon, however, is
a decision by the National G r a p h i c a l
A s s o c i a t i o n (who form a closed shop'at
Photo mech) to only accept business if
the artwork has been done by N G A
members. Since a lot of Photomech's
trade is with students and their unions,
who normally do their own artwork, the
company could be badly affected.
There i s , though, good news from
NUS Marketing, a new company, which
is expanding rapidly. T h i s year it h a s
already notched up s a l e s of £200,000.
A financial breakdown (!) is not yet
a v a i l i b l e , but I suspect that initial cost
of setting up the company, w i l l balance
this year's 'profits'.
The discount card has been a massive
s u c s e s s . By the way if you cannot
obtain a discount at a store which is
listed in the discount handbook, and
you have a discount card, you should
write direct to NUS who w i l l refund the
amount of discount y o u have lost and
take the matter up with the store
involved.
On a happier line, John Menzies
have joined the scheme and are now
offering a 70% discount to students.
F o l l o w i n g last w e e k ' s open External
Affairs meeting, we have submitted
amendments to N U S motions on Welfare,
Housing, NUS Constitution, NUS S e r v i c e s ,
Grants and C u t s and South A f r i c a . T h e s e
motions, if prioritized, w i l l be composited
and, hopefully, returned to the Union in
time for them to be d i s c u s s e d at the
UGM on December 2nd. Here we w i l l be
able to mandate our delegates to N U S
Conference.
