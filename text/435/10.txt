Dastardly tactics take IC to top
Medhurst 0 IC 1
A 3-phase plan was the Cap-
tain's latest idea for overwhelming
the opposition when IC travelled
to Medhurst to play the league
leaders.
The first stage was to send the
forwards off in one car with scant
directions to the venue, and take
the rest of the team in the mini-
van. This resulted with the game
starting 10 minutes before the
forwards arrived.
This lead on to stage two of
his dastardly plot: tire out the
opposition by getting his players
to hit the ball in random fashion
all over the field and leave the
opposition to fetch it.
On to stage 3: The opposition
were already disheartened by
their inability to penetrate seven
men and were rocked further back
cn their heels as a further four
players arrived. .However, after
some initial tottering, Medhurst
regained their balance and began
to play like the league leaders they
were.
They attacked with gusto,
using the breadth of the field, but
the IC defence played well and all
their scoring chances were thwar-
ted by demon play from Charlie
Brown in goal.
Between these bouts of pres-
sure the forwards were not only
admiring the abilities of the de-

fence, but were actively engaged
in trying to score goals. They, in
turn, were aided in this endeavour
by tenacious and visionary play
from midfield, which provided a
constant stream of balls to the
front.
The forwards tried hard but
were often foiled by a lack of cool-
headedness in front of goal. How-
ever one attack did produce a
score. Mike Isles' snapshot sent
the ball sauntering towards their
goal. The goalkeeper, flummoxed
by the insouciant attitude of the
ball, could only let it rebound of
his pads to where Trevor Tutu,
acting with alacrity far beyond any
he had shown previously, depo-
sited it in the back of the net.
This one goal advantage was
preserved to give IC its sixth con-
secutive win taking us to the top
of the league - a suitable reflec-
tion on the new attitude and spirit
of the side.

In our usual well-organised
way we arrived at the opposition
ground at about 1.15pm only
to find that the place w a s
deserted a n d that the match
was not due to start until
3.00pm.
Guinness were 'unfortunately'
unable to find enough women
for their team and s o played
7 men a n d 4 women. They
were a l s o unable to supply
an umpire, s o our bronchitic
captain, C h a s Hardy, w a s
volunteered the j o b . H e
continually cursed the fact
that he w a s doing more
running about than the players
themselves.
Missed chances
The game w a s fairly even
with quite a lot of end-to-end
play. Both teams had quite a
few scoring c h a n c e s . Defensive
errors from I C enabled Guinness
to put home two of these. I n
contrast I C were unable to
score e v e n from a range o f
10 yards.
The match was enjoyed by
a l l a n d the serious part of
the afternoon came when free

draw to gain the first d i v i s i o n
title, but gave their home
'crowd' something t o ' shout
when their goals tally r a n
into double figures. T h e I C
team was only promoted to the
first d i v i s i o n last year.
Otter score first
A s the first quarter got
underway there w a s no
indication from I C of the
goal-scoring spree to follow.
Indeed, it was the Otter team
who scored their two goals
first, although Rory d i d p u l l
one back before the second
quajter.
i n the second quarter I C
pulled level with a penalty
taken by Peter McCartney.
Then goals from P a u l H i n d l e ,
Michael McCartney and C l i f f
Spooner s e t I C on the road
to victory. Otter continued to
play their fair share of
attacking water-polo, but Ian

equal J o any shof they could
produce.
Hat-trick
It was in the third quarter,
however, that I C really showed
their superiority. T h e referee,
perhaps feeling a little sorry
for Otter, twice sent out I C
players. In both cases I C
replied, w h i l e being a man
down, with goals from C l i f f
and R o r
y . Sh^.tlv afrerWards
C l i f f completed his hat-trick.
F o r the final quarter Dave
Lowther w a s brought into
action, because C l i f f w a s
judged to have inflicted
enough punishment o n the
opposition. N e v e r t h e l e s s , IC
extended their lead with
another from M i c h a e l .
T o their credit Otter fought
to the very end and forced Ian
to produce some dynamic
goalkeeping. F i n a l l y Andy
Smith marked h i s return to the
team by rounding off the score
for I C .
