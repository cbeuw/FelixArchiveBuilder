JUST FYNGYR LYKYN'
GOOD
After four excellent studio L P s , with
only a couple of d u d tracks between
them, it w a s on the cards that a I ive
album, in the vein of a ' B e s t o f , would
be recorded, trying to capture them i n
their ture state, (sorry) a Southern Rock
Boogie Band. What an absolute* gem i t
is too.
It speeds along at a terrific rate,
opening with a rocking plug for their
recording company, 'Workin for MCA',
then straight • into, 'I Ain't the One',
slowing in pace only for such tasteful
numbers a s 'Tuesday's Gone', 'Sweet
Home Alabama' and 'Needle and the
Spoon'.
The climax to the album i s the very
last track, the brilliant, 'Free Bird',
which starts off with the tinkling guitar
from A l l e n C o l l i n s , and the gravel voiced
vocals of Ronnie V a n Z a n t , w h o i s
eventually swamped under by the
blistering guitar work of the three lead
guitarists, namely C o l l i n s , Garry
Rossington and Steve G a i n s . The last of
these makes h i s recording debut on this
album.
Out of the fourteen tracks on t h i s
double album, there are only three w h i c h
weren't previously available on record,
ie 'T tor Texas', a 'Skydnerdysed'
version of the country c l a s s i c by Jimmie
Rodgers,'Travellin'Man' and 'Crossroads',
a l l are destined to be Skynyrd F a v o u r i t e s .
The thing that makes Lynyrd Skynyrd
s o good, for me, is their unpretentious
approach t o rock; they give a rock
hungry audience exactly what it wants,
raunchy, hard hitting numbers, that
make y o u wan'na move your feet, a n d
sing a l o n g . T h i s album gives you
exactly that. I've seen them live three
times, and this i s the c l o s e s t recording
to how Skynyrd really a r e — mean and
b a s i c .
I thought of writing 'It you've not
been turned on tb Lynyrd Skynyrd yet,
this is the album to do it. It doesn't
make the previous LPs obsolete because
there are so many excellent tracks not
given a look in on this one. 'One more
from the Road', should be in every
Skynyrd fans' record collection, as I am
sure it will be'. B u t I thought better ot
it. Still the L P ' s terrific.

I was thinking of walking out half-way
through H o r s l i p s ' s e t ; but then I g o t
bored and fell a s l e e p . I awoke to find
theband engrossed in some delightful
Irish (folk) j i g s .
Both the band and the capacity
audience came to enjoy themselves, and
neither left disappointed. Well that just
goes to show how subjective a review
can be.
One can't fault H o r s l i p s t e c h n i c a l l y ,
but I found them at times rather s e l f ,
indulgent, particularly during 'The First
Movement ot the Gaelic Symphony?
Nevertheless, when they did start playing
their f o l k / r o c k jigs they became terrific
crowd inspirers.
The band are fairly talented, e s p e c i a l ly
their v i o l i n i s t and keyboard player.
These two give the and a very traditional
Irish identity, which raises them above
other bands in the foot-shuffling rock
idiom.
Despite a n energetic performance
all-round I c a n remember seeing better
H o r s l i p s "concerts a t I C . S t i l l , they
were right for a good hop at the end.
