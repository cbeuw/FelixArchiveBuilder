Wednesday's Carnival Committee
meeting was not a happy occasion. T o
see respectably ranked members of
the Union indulging in petty squabbles
just to uphold the image of their C C U
does them, Rag and ICU no good
whatsoever. Let's hope we can now
get down to the spirit of IC Rag and
its associated socialising, without
inter and intra — C C U bickering.
Enjoy yourselves. Rag Week is here.
Refectory prices
Just in case you were taken in by
our story ('Food prices stay constant',
front page) last week or by Nick
Brayshaw's Pres Cutting's (page 4)
this week, refectory prices H A V E
gone up since October lst. In fact
they went up (about 2 — 5p a meal)
last Friday to allow for items that have
increased in price since the last
refectory increase. Mr Mooney IS
allowed to do this without referral to
Refectory Committee.
The latter have decided not to in-
crease prices at the present time.
Hmm (pause for thought I
Overseas Students
Regarding Nick B ' s claim (page
4) that the idea of a new sub-committee
for overseas students was his. I
have it on good authority that was
not. The persons concerned have
threatened to write a letter to F E L I X
explaining all next week. Besides
which if it was his idea where was
he when the meeting took place?
Felix needs you
The Business Manager and I are
finding it difficult to get out to see
local' advertisers. We would like a
few volunteers to train as Business
Assistants. A desire to help F E L I X
and an urge to sell are the only
prerequisities. Duncan Suss and I
feel able to teach applicants all
the necessary skills. (Aren't we
damn egotists).

Sexism re-
instated
Birmingham U n i v e r s i t y
Students . G u i l d h a s come out
in favour of s e x i s t events
after a week of fierce debate.
T h e trouble started when
the G u i l d ' s M e d i c a l Society
advertised their forthcoming
'Dragperson B a l l ' .
L a s t Tuesday a heated two
hour G u i l d ' s C o u n c i l debate l e d
to a motion banning such
e v e n t s . T h e b a l l was described
as 'disgusting and degrading'
by some (Guild) C o u n c i l l o r s ,
who argued that ' e x t e n s i v e
damage to G u i l d buildings
and s t a f f had resulted from
previous Dragperson B a l l s .
Their d e c i s i o n was reversed
at a n extremely w e l l attended
G u i l d General Meeting (equi-
valent to an IC U G M ) . Despite
heated d i s c u s s i o n the
majority for s e x i s t . events
was large.

Social needs
first
A c a l l for a revolution in
Government economic thinking
was made a t T u e s d a y ' s S o c i a l -
ist Society meeting. T o m
L i t t e r i c M P proposed a
revival of the a l l o c a t i o n of
investment resources according
to s o c i a l needs; he rejected
the current trend, where
'the prices of consumer goods
are determined by the capital-
istic egoes of a few selfish
elements.
He thought that the use of
old methods to contain un-
employment a n d prices w a s
pointless a s they h a d not *
worked i n the past. H e c a l l e d
for the s o c i a l i s a t i o n of the
" b i g f e w " w h o have the
power to control B r i t a i n ' s
external trade to suit their
whim, s o that they should be
accountable for their a c t i o n s

Abel to handle
I C W A
Rupert A b e l (Mining 2) was
elected Mr ICWA o n Monday.
The post, makes Mr A b e l the
only member of ICWA.
The competition w a s this
year judged on who could
best help ICWA and not a s in
past y e a r s , where the winner
was the man with the knobbliest
k n e e s .
F i v e competitors enteied
the competition, but only 2
turned up to Monday's meeting,
Mr A b e l and R S M U H o n Sec
Steve P a t e r s o n .
Mr A b e l pledged himself to
promote I C W A ' s interests,
although he's not sure how he
w i l l go about this.
Rents freeze
-thaw expected
C o l l e g e H a l l a n d House
rents w i l l not be increased
next term. T h i s d e c i s i o n .was
taken last week at a meeting
of- the F i n a n c e Sub-Committee
of the C o l l e g e Student
R e s i d e n c e Committee.
Recent national press
reports have suggest, however,
that this w i l l not remain the
situation for very much longer.
A n increase, in real terms, of
25% has been put forward i n
a confidential Department of
E d u c a t i o n and Science docu-
ment leaked to T h e Guardian
newspaper.
Bo' blow out

vetran c a r , suffered a tyre

show procession.
The blow-out h a s left a
three-quarter inch hole i n the

letter
M O R E D I S C O U N T Guilds reply
J O H N M E N Z I E S , the w e l l -
known high street stationers,
have joined the National
Student Discount Scheme.
Henceforth a l l NSDS card
holders w i l l get a 10% discount
on goods bought at their
stores.
If you haven't bought your
Discount C a r d y e t then I C
Union h a s just obtained a
fresh stock. These are a v a i l -
able from the U n i o n Office.
Sporting success
I C ' s D a v i d Rosen has won
the premier Individual O r i e n -
teering Championship for South
E a s t E n g l a n d . He clinched the
title at Sunday's final South
Eastern Galloppen where he
came second, winning four out
of the seven events. Seven
Galloppen, or league events
are held e a c h year.
T h i s brought h i s points
total for the Championship to
498 out of a p o s s i b l e 5 0 0 .
R o s e n ' s consistent perform-
ance could well put him in
line, for a place in the B r i t i s h
team at the next World
Championships.
Dear Sir, — It was with great
interest that we read the letter
in last w e e k ' s F E L I X from
Messres Braund and Dodge
entitled ' L - P l a t e s for L u n a c y ' .
In it they claimed that R C S
' f e e l that by definition,
mascotry should be good
humoured activity with no real
violence a n d definitely no
actions which could endanger
life or limb', and added that
they would continue to follow
these guidelines.
It was with some surprise,
therefore, that after the
E l e c E n g freshers dinner we
found that barriers and
obstacles had been placed
in the road outside C i v E n g
with the result that the c a r
of our guest speaker w a s
damaged. Furthermore, there
was a trip wire across the
R e c t o r ' s Gate (a fact which
was witnessed by the D e a n of
R C S ) which would certainly
endanger limbs.
Whilst w e appreciate that
one cannot control completely
the actions o f individual
members of the Union, Mr
Braund might set a better
example than to invite a
member o f G u i l d s to a stand
up fist fight, i n front of many
impressionable freshers.
We certainly agree with
R C S that mascotry should be
non-violent but \ye just w i s h
that they were capable o f
abiding by their own guide-
l i n e s .
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,
