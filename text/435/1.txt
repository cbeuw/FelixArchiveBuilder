Not SO bright fflHIi Procession on despite squabbles
E x - R C S U P r e s i d e n t Steve
Brightman e s c a p e d unhurt
when h i s car crashed into the
Mechanical Engineering build-
ing last F r i d a y night.
The accident happened at
around 11.30pm, when Mr
Brightman's yellow Dolomite
Sprint w a s travelling from the
Sherfield B u i l d i n g towards
Mechanical Engineering. T h e
car failed to negotiate the
right hand bend at Mech E n g .
It struck the kerb, turned o n
its side and then ploughed
into three windows on level
one of the engineering
building.
There was no fire, and the
occupants of the c a r , Mr
Brightman and Dave N i c k s o n ,
emerged uninjured but shaken
from the battered v e h i c l e .
E s t i m a t e s vary greatly as
to the cost of the damage to
the car and b u i l d i n g .
Mines President Paul Kurowski this week refused to streak
around the Albert Hall to raise Rag funds. He said it lowers the.
lowers the image of RSM. Perhaps some others, who could raise
the standard should accompany him.
RCS Rag totals up
R C S Union this week
surpassed their last year's
total for money collected for
R a g . They did s o whilst s e l l i n g
Rag Mags to those on Wed-
nesday's N U S / T U C 'Fight the
C u t s ' march.
R C S U have now c o l l e c t e d
£1,583 for R a g this year, £80
greater than last year's total.
£100 of the total came from
R a g Mag s a l e s on Wednesday.
The march was the biggest
industrial demonstration i n
London in recent times. Over
40,000 people attended,
including some 35 or so from
IC U n i o n . Demonstrators
reacted quite w e l l to the R a g
Mag s e l l e r s , although ex-IC
President Trevor P h i l l i p s
jested 'Why don't you come
into line with the rest of us'.
Mascots
The University C o l l e g e
mascot P h i n e a s w a s returned
by G u i l d s to U C at the C & G U
bar night on Sunday.
T h e mascot was transferred
at about 10pm, although U C
students arrived at the Union
bar by 8pm. T h e y joined, but
were u n s u c c e s s f u l , i n the
Guilds bar night f e s t i v i t i e s .
Rag off?
-No way!
This year's Rag Procession is to go ahead as announced
in last week's FELIX. This was agreed, after much intra-
CCU squabling and petty recriminations, at a Carnival
Committee meeting on Wednesday evening.
The Procession will be waved off by the Rector and
Lady Flowers tomorrow morning.
Although an affirmative
d e c i s i o n w a s reached, at one
stage a s e c t i o n of the meeting
almost swung opinion to the
contrary.
Lack of arrangements
L e d by C h r i s Morrel, R C S U
President, this conclave com-
plained bitterly about the
arrangements made for the
P r o c e s s i o n a n d the fact that
only two twenty-foot lorries
were available to carry four
floats on the P r o c e s s i o n .
'With only two lorries we're
going to be the laughing stock
of Kensington,' M i s s Morrel
c l a i m e d . John K e a r n s , last
year's Rag Chairman, answered
her by pointing out that Queen
E l i z a b e t h C o l l e g e , only had
three lorries on their (very
s u c c e s s f u l ) R a g P r o c e s s i o n
last year.
The R C S U disappointment
was heightened since they
have gone to great lengths to
obtain float that led the
L o r d Mayor's P r o c e s s i o n last
Saturday. T h i s features a
large robin, a momento to S i r
Robin G i l l e t the new L o r d
Mayor.
R C S U later urged everyone
to get a s many v e h i c l e s a n d
people a s p o s s i b l e d r e s s e d
up and out on the P r o c e s s i o n .
The meeting began' degen-
erating, due to lack of
positive chairing by Martin
J u d k i n s , the R a g Chairman.
It took a rallying c a l l of
'Let's do the best with what
we've got' by John White,
I C U Hon S e c , to restore order
to the meeting a n d sympathy
to this year's P r o c e s s i o n
arrangements.
Rag Felix
More wrangling ensued over
the question of a s p e c i a l R a g
edition of F E L I X . T h e idea
was given the go-ahead and
the C C U Presidents w i l l b e
responsible for s e l l i n g this
s p e c i a l issue of F E L I X which
is published on December 3rd.
It w i l l cost 5p and a l l t h e
money c o l l e c t e d s h a l l go
to R a g .
