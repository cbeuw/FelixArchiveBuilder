Lord Mayor's Show report
and a good time was had by all
4.30am Saturday morning loomed early (for a change) and so I
set about joining two or three other hardy individuals in the dark
and freezing c o l d of Mines quad to polish up our (loaned) file-
engine for the Lord Mayer's Show. A t 6.30, the engine gleaming
like a new p i n , so the crew returned to Southside for breakfast.
My thanks to T i n a Pearson and Sandra for s o ably doing the
eggs and bacon, and a l s o to Mssrs H a l l , Reditt, Dodge, Q i l l e t t ,
C o x , Mattback for helping polish the engine and for working so
hard helping generally with getting the show on the road. •
About 7.00 we left for. London Wall; it dawned a s we raced
past Buckingham P a l a c e klaxon screaming, bell ringing, and a l l
shouting " F i r e " . But we didn't get a stately two-fingers from
any of the windows.
10 minutes after we arrived at London Wall, soaking wet and
freezing c o l d , up rode G u i l d s in ' B o , looking similarly the worse
for wear. In fact ' B o nearly got flattened by a tank transporter
but fortunately the army driver m i s s e d .
About 9.00 the rest of the floats arrived and were c l o s e l y
followed by the R C S contingent, led by C h r i s Morrell arid A d e
Sudworth. B y 10.30 we were ready for the off, and away we went
(restraining Chris from attacking the V i k i n g s on an adjacent
f l o a t : ' H e ' s got a lovely,chopper!!'
I have never seen s o many people in my life, everybody cheer-
ing and waving. It was an amazing sight, e s p e c i a l l y with a l l the
kids there.
J e z (Mark II) and B o both got excellent receptions due to the
students trying to get the crowd involved in the show rather than
just standing watching.^ _
As we come up to St Paul's, Bo' suffered a blow-out (leaving
a three-quarter inch hole in a tyre, which will cost about £50 to
repair) and was unable to continue in the procession.
Just after that N i c k G i l let (son of the
new Lord Mayor and our own R C S T V star) managed to get
interviewed by the B B C . The interviewer nearly broke his neck
climbing on the engine, but thats another story.
After lunch at K i n g ' s C o l l e g e we finished the second half of
the procession (we a l l had 'stately-wavers elbow' by this time)
and then piled back to c o l l e g e .
A s you may have seen, were you in Southside at the time, R C S
decided t o g i v e a fire-fighting display and connected the engine
up to a fire-hydrant, putting 100,000 gallons^a minute on to the
Hawthorn tree (This answers a l l the people who are wondering
where the leaves went).
Again I feel s p e c i a l thanks must be due to R C S Motor Qlub
for arranging the loan and J e z (Mk II) from Dennis Motors "and to
Nick G i l let for keeping my head above water with respect to a
lot of what goes on in the Lord Mayor's Show.
