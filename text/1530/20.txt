Wallowing in the Wadden
Stephanie Walton takes an unusual walk by the sea
doubt many visitors to The
Netherlands stray far beyond
the amazing museums, ca-
nals and liberal attractions
of Amsterdam. So it was per-
haps unsurprising that I was met with
quizzical looks when I announced
that I was oﬀ to The Netherlands to
go Wadlopen. Wadlopen, the art of
walking on mudﬂats exposed at low
tide by the Wadden Sea, was some-
thing that until recently I had never
even heard of, let alone considered
doing. When I read about it in my
guide book, however, I was very keen
to try this unusual activity.
Websites and locals warn against
attempting this niche sport without
a guide. Not only is it important to
minimise ecological disturbance, but
the tide can turn quickly, leaving you
stranded out at sea. However, since
the local guided tour costs a hefty
forty Euros and included the dubious
pleasure of spending three hours in a
ﬁshing boat, the ﬁve of us decided to
go it alone. How hard could it be?
Staying in the vibrant university
city of Groningen (which, incidental-
ly, boasts a truly excellent children’s
play ground), we found that our near-
est entrance to the Wadden Sea was
due north, near Usquert. On arrival,
however, although we could see the
sea (indeed tantalisingly close), there
were many muddy ﬁelds between it
and us, hampering our advance. Not
to be deterred, we took oﬀ our shoes
and started our Wadlopen there and
then. But within two hours we had
moved a total displacement of 20
metres; the tar-like mud was deep
and treacherous, and getting stuck
in it was an all-too-likely possibility.
When we happened upon a single
shoe abandoned in the mud, we re-
alised that our eﬀorts were futile and
that we would never even reach the
sea. Exhausted and humbled by na-
ture, we turned back to ﬁrm land.
For those defeated by, or uninter-
ested in, mud, the North thankfully
has lots more to oﬀer, primarily beau-
tiful windmills, castles, and a rare
star-shaped fort at Bourtange: our
trip was by no means a disappoint-
ment.
Would I advise you to try Wadlopen
yourself? Deﬁnitely. It is an oppor-
tunity to try an extraordinary sport
in some beautiful scenery far away
from the tourist trail. Pack warm old
clothes which you don’t mind get-
ting muddy. And above all, be sure to
bring a good book for the three hours’
ride in the ﬁshing boat.

Hey there horses, how you doin’?
Yeah, mud party!
Everybody dance real slow...
I know it looks like mud but I
promise it tastes just like chocolate.
