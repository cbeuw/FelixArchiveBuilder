FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER
HEAR rejected by Oxbridge
vantage of what higher education has
to oÔ¨Äer as well as, according to Sir
Robert Burgess, vice-chancellor of the
University of Leicester, who was the
author of the report, will stop ‚Äúdam-
aging obsession‚Äù with Ô¨Årst and upper
second class degrees. Furthermore,
HEAR will allow employers to get a
better picture of who their applicants
are as well as to be more certain about
the claims made on applicants‚Äô CVs.
Since then, The Burgess Implementa-
tion Steering Group (BISG) created
by Universities UK and GuildHE have
tested the new scheme in 30 diÔ¨Äerent
institutions across the country and the
Ô¨Ånal report was published in October
this year where universities were rec-
ommended to include the new report
for the students who enrolled this
year.
There is some conÔ¨Çict evidence of
what the general position of the uni-
versities regarding the scheme is. So
far 109 have signed up for it and this
is more than a half of all the higher
education institutions, however, this
only includes 14 out of 24 members of
the Russell Group. Furthermore, Ox-
bridge has already completely rejected
the idea with Oxford being concerned
with ‚Äúa lack of interest from employ-
ers‚Äù and Cambridge giving no rea-
son at all. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs too early
to give up ‚Äì Peter Williams, one of
the members of BISG, is certain that
Oxbridge will eventually adopt the
scheme ‚Äúbut only if the HEAR catches
up generally‚Äù, stating that ‚ÄúOxbrige
[is] not generally ‚Äòleading‚Äô universities
when it comes to innovations of this
sort.‚Äù
Having previously recognized that a
degree on its own is no longer good
enough to get a job, at the beginning
of this year Imperial introduced Im-
perial Horizons which is a program
oÔ¨Äering the undergraduates to en-
hance their university experience
with a short course in a wide variety
of humanities‚Äô subjects. According
to The Head of Co-Curricular Stud-
ies, Eryl Price-Davies, their team are
‚Äúcommitted to representing, on a stu-
dent‚Äôs transcript, that they have taken
and achieved in Imperial Horizons
courses‚Äù which essentially follows the
idea of HEAR. But the Ô¨Ånal decision
is still to come and is partially up to
students: ‚ÄúWe are consulting with stu-
dents on the best form of wording. We
wouldn‚Äôt want to do it without con-
sulting students‚Äù
Doug Hunt, Deputy President (Edu-
cation) was asked for comment on the
matter and said: ‚ÄúMy personal opinion
is that the HEAR or a similar record-
ing system would be good for Imperial
undergraduates, since a large propor-
The election results for the outstanding
Council positions have been announced.
In the incredibly catchily named Faculty
of Engineering Undergraduate Coun-
cil Ordinary Member Election, Joseph
Gibbs, Oladipupo and Thomas Lim were
all elected with 64, 30, and 21 votes in
the Ô¨Årst round respectively. Joseph Gibbs
was elected in Round 1, with the other
two being elected in Round 2. The faced
competition from four other students, as
well as the ever present, infamous RON
(Re-Open Nominations).
The even catchier titled Faculty of
Medicine Postgraduate Council Ordi-
nary Member Electioon was won by
Maia Kavanagh Williamson with 7 votes.
The other candidate gaining 1 vote.
Therefore Williamson was elected. This
singles the end of Council election fever.

them stand out when they are going
through the application process for an
internship, job or possibly a PhD.
However Union Council will be dis-
cussing Imperial College Union‚Äôs oÔ¨É-

Along with the Ô¨Ånal decision on Im-
perial Horizons, the decision regard-
ing the HEAR is also to be made as the
position of Imperial on the matter is
still not clear. However, Imperial Col-
lege London produces a degree sup-
plement, which is similar to this and
includes much of the extra-curricular
material that the report focuses on.

¬£5000 challenge launched
The Institute of Global Health Inno-
vation (IGHI) has announced that it
is holding its student challenges com-
petition, with an increased prize of
¬£5000 to develop the winning project
further.
This is the second year that the
competition will be running, and the
award is aimed at supporting research
at Imperial that has a focus on tack-
ling health problems and challenges
throughout the world. The IGHI want
the competition to be ‚Äúan opportunity
to showcase work‚Äù. The project is open
to those studying BSc, MSc, MEng,
MPH, MRes or MBA. The students‚Äô
Ô¨Ånal-year projects will be the basis for
their entry.
The evaluation criteria of submit-
ted work will include the technical or
business innovation, but also analysis
of global health impact and economic
application and feasibility. The Insti-
tute wants encouragement of novel
concepts that can cover any feature of
global health in devolved and develop-
ing countries.
Last year‚Äôs ¬£2000 prize was awarded
to John Chetwood, then a Ô¨Åfth year
medic, whose project used urinary
biomarkers to create a new diagnostic
tool in order to detect an aggressive
form of liver-Ô¨Çuke associated cancer,
Cholangiocarcinoma (CGA). vCGA
has increasing incidents worldwide
and has very high rates in areas of
South East Asia. John aims to use the
prize money to validate Ô¨Åndings in a
larger study and has goals in develop-
ing a urine dipstick to detect the can-
cer earlier and more accurately.
The 2012 competition was chaired
by Sir Liam Donaldson, former Chief
Medical OÔ¨Écer and Chair of Public
Health Policy at Imperial. Jane Dreap-
er, BBC health correspondent, and
Sarah Brown, maternal health activist
and wife of Gordon Brown, were also
included in last year‚Äôs judging panel.
Entrants are going to have to adhere
Niall Jeffrey Reporter
to their respective department‚Äôs Ô¨Ånal
year project guideline of the home de-
partment and submit their completed
thesis with 250 words abstract with
their supervisor‚Äôs covering letter of
support to the competition. A thesis
should be emailed to ighi@imperial.
ac.uk by 14 January 2013 in order to
enter the competition.
