Slitherlink
Fit for a King?
You really like Slitherlink, don’t you? You
probably don’t need me to remind you how to
solve it, but just in case: you need to construct
a single closed loop by joining the dots so that
the numbered squares are surrounded by the
corresponding number of lines. For instance,
a square numbered “0” must have no line seg-
ments surrounding it (or else).
It’s time to elect a new governor on the island. Each inhabitant has exacly one vote.
Inhabitants who vote for the same person have come to be called “cohorts” by the
island’s newspapers. Two of the candidates are interviewed about the results of the
election (we remind that knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie).
Richard Wiltshire: An interesting fact about the election was that every voter voted
for a cohort of theirs.
Dave Gorrister:Andanypair ofvoters werecohorts.
Interviewer: So, are you each implying that there was a clear winner?
RW: Of course not!
DG:Absolutelynot!
Who’s a knight and who’s a knave? Who won the election?
The Duchess’s statement implies there was an even number of guests (because if there were n
knaves, there were n knights). The Duke contradicts that by implying there was an odd num-
ber of guests. The Reverend correctly observes that the couple can’t both be knights, so he is a
knight,andtheDuchessisaknightaswell,assheagrees.TheDukeisaknave,andashesaysthat

It’s another nonogam; the

a reminder, it’s 1 point for sending in a

Miss the crossword this week?
You certainly didn’t seem to
the past few weeks. E-mail us
if you want it back.
Consider yourself a master code-breaker?
Give the Codeword a go. It’s as simple as it
looks: each number corresponds to a letter;
that is, there is a bijection between the let-
ters of the English alphabe tand the set {1, 2,
..., 26} (that should get you math nerds ex-
cited enough about it).

Here’s another new puz-
zle, because we didn’t
have enough of those
already. Your goal is to
connect all the islands
with bridges so that it
is possible to get from
any island to any other
island. The restrictions
are that the bridges
must be either vertical
or horizonal, there may
not be more than two
bridges between any
two islands, and each
island must have exactly
as many bridges as the
number on it states.
