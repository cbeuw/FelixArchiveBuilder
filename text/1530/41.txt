EXCLUSIVE!
Romney announces he “only ran
for a bet” and wasn’t interested in
“being some shitty President or like
whatever anyway”.
In a bitter and profanity-laden
concession speech, Republican
Presidential candidate Mitt Rom-
ney claimed he’d only run for
president as a bet with his friends.
“Yeah it was all some stupid bet”
stated the former Governor of Mas-
sachusetts, “me and a few of the
guys from the church were having
a wild night on the OJ and lemon-
ades. Naturally, it got out of control
and one of the guys said “hey Mitt,
bet you couldn’t run for president
in 2012” and that was that”. The
GOP candidate went on to add “of
course, once my blood-sugar lev-
els had dropped I regretted it im-
mediately” before continuing “I
mean President? Who goes in for
that these days”. When asked why
he’d spent nearly a billion dollars
on a bet he stated “I don’t fucking
know, what on earth else were we
supposed to do with the money
anyway?”. Shortly before storming
off stage, Romney added “And good
luck to President Osama, or what-
ever his name is”, “not that anyone
cares”. At press time, sources con-
firmed that Romney’s meeting with
his VIP backers after the results
was “awkward”.
