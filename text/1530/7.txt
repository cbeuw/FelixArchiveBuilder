FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER
Down to business?
mperial College London has
consistently ranked within the
World Top 10 in the QS rank-
ings as well as in other respect-
able league tables. However,
Imperial’s Business school rankings for
the MBA programme are slipping, with
Imperial’s MBA currently being ranked
46th place in the Financial Times. These
rankings are a signiﬁcant decrease
from previous years, when the business
school took 37th place last year and was
ranked 32nd in 2010, which was the
highest ranking achieved by Imperial’s
MBA programme. Imperial’s business
school entered the top 90 in 2002, it ﬁrst
broke into the Financial Times world’s
top 50 MBA rankings in 2006. This
equated to an impressive rise of 30 plac-
es within 3 years. Yet the 14 place slip
over the last 3 years may suggest that the
rapid boom was short lived.
FT rankings overview
This year, Imperial’s MBA ranking po-
sitions it lower than LSB (4th), Oxford
(20th), Cambridge (26th), Warwrick
(27th ), Manchester (31st), Cranﬁeld
(36th) and Cass (38th). Within the sub
categories, Imperial’s highest was for
career progress, where it came in at 19.
Imperial’s value for money was ranked
in 38th position.
The tuition fees for the full time MBA
are £36,000; this is a fairly competitive
value in terms of cost if compare to
London Business School (LBS), where
the MBA tuition fees were almost 60%
more than Imperial’s at a tremendous
£57,500. The FT ranks LBS 4th and this
was the highest ranking achieved by any
UK business school. Stanford ranked 1st
place, it has a tuition fees of $106,236,
which equates to £66,496. It may seem
like the tuition fees of an MBA pro-
gramme increases with its ranking,
however, the cost not always correlated
to its position in the league table. The
MBA oﬀered by India’s Institue of Man-
agement Ahmedabad was ranked 11th
by the FT; the tuition fees were Rs. 15
Lakhs, which equates to £17,280.
How are the FT rankings compiled?
To be considered for the FT ranking, the
business school must be internationally
accredited as well as have run the course
for at least four consecutive years. In
2012, 150 business schools participated
in the rankings. The data is compiled
from online surveys completed by the
school as well as former students. 20 dif-
ferent criteria are used to determine the
ﬁnal ranking. Data from alumni con-
tributes to 8 of the 20 categories, which
carries 59% of the rankings weight. Data
collected in 2012 carries 50% of the ﬁnal
weight, the remaining data is from the
2010 and 2011 rankings that contribute
25% each. The ﬁrst two categories inves-
tigate the diﬀerence in the alumni salary
from the start of their MBA to 2012, this
gives the current and weighted salary
for the business school. 11 other crite-
ria contribute to 31% of the ﬁnal rank,
they are determined by a questionnaire
completed by the business school. This
Nida Mahmud probes the latest ranking of the Business School
questionnaire investigates factors such
as diversity of teaching staﬀ and MBA
students as well as the international
reach of the MBA. The ﬁnal criteria
is the research rank, it calculates the
number of articles published by staﬀ
members in 45 diﬀerent journals. Con-
sequently, a ﬁnal score is calculated for
each school that can be used to rank the
MBA.
The QS rankings
The QS Global 200 Business Schools
Report ranks business schools with re-
spect to geographic location or MBA
specialisation. Imperial was ranked 12th
within the Europe business school cat-
egory. For the specialised MBA catego-
ry, Imperial makes the global top 50 for
two categories: Entrepreneurship and
Finance, at positions 24 and 22 respec-
tively for 2012. QS also oﬀer a person-
alised score card service, which is an in-
teractive tool that personalises the MBA
rankings depending on the criteria most
important to the student.
And Finally….
Nevertheless, uni-
versity rankings
should also be
taken with cau-
tion as diﬀerent
methodologies
are used to com-
pile the rankings.
It is sometimes
diﬃcult to know
how the rankings
are compiled and
what sources have
been considered.
Furthermore, tak-
ing a global view of
the MBA rankings
may be mislead-
ing. For example, a
lot of emphasis on MBA league tables
is placed on the average salary received
after graduation, yet this ﬁgure varies
drastically depending on the geographic
location. Additionally, the MBA league
table produced by the Economist has
not considered Imperial within its top
100 rank, the reason behind this is un-
clear.
