ang, all that election
stuﬀ was a bit dull,
wasn’t it? Obama this,
America that. R-Mon-

Bill, never forget. But I digress. While
many enjoyed the Year 7 Geography-
inspired thrills and spills of people
sequentially announcing whether a
state would be coloured in blue or red,
some of us had deadlines and stuﬀ and
couldn’t possibly be that concerned
with who was going to head up the
world’s biggest capitalist superpower.
But again, I digress.
In this groundbreaking section, we
recently covered ways Imperial could
get people back crowding at the win-
dows of Beit. This week we turn to
the depths of social media in order to
investigate how you (yes, you!) could
post an exact timely duplicate of about
50 other Facebook statuses without
even trying! It’s a little like crowding
around windows again, but this time
replace ‘windows’ with ‘Facebook sta-
tuses’. Bear with me.

I don’t know whether I dodged a bul-
let by avoiding the majority of Julian
Fellowes anachronistic smash hit thus
far. But what I’m sure of is the sheer
dramatic potential on oﬀer, at least
judging by the inﬂux of Facebook sta-
tuses every Sunday evening. Anyway,
to business. Have they hanged the in-
famous Bates yet? If he’s free or some-
thing I’m heading straight to ITV to
give them a piece of my mind.
WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT A TEN-
NIS MATCH CONCURRENTLY OC-
CURRING
I don’t know what it is about tennis
that lends itself so well to news feeds.
Not football, not rugby, not even cro-
quet can cajole a similar response out
of you virtual denizens. Whether it’s
Murray in a hurry or Federer winning
a cow as a prize or something, the rac-
quet-based antics seem to never end.
It’s always 6-2 to someone, one set up.
I really don’t know what it is about
that score in particular.
With this advice in tow, you now have
the considerable potential to contrib-
ute a status to Facebook similar in
content to another individual’s. I’m
sure your life has been improved con-
siderably with this knowledge. That’s
what I’m here for, after all. If you have
irrelevant content designed for these
pages email it in. Peace out.

That Romney’s a bit of suspicious fel-

have considered voting for him? I dun-
no, don’t ask me. I’m not American.
