Help I’m trapped in the Fe-
lix printing press, I’m nearly
out of air and the water
level is rising fast. If you get
this message please call
02075948072 and tell who-
ever answers the phone that
Barnaby loves them dearly,
but that sadly this is good-
bye. They’ll understand.
This week you get accused
of plagiarism on a piece of
coursework. You email your
personal tutor protesting
that “imitation is the sincer-
est form of flattery,” how-
ever you fail to reference
the quote to Charles Caleb
Colton and get yourself into
even more trouble. Boned.
This week you’re on Uni-
versity Challenge. It’s neck
and neck, and the decid-
ing question is “who’s the
cat that wont cop out when
there’s danger about,” and
your opponent doesn’t know.
“SHAFT” you proclaim; “Ya
damn right,” replies Pax-
man, smoothly and suavely.
This week Imgur brings in
the new gallery setting and
frankly it’s ruined your fa-
vourite procrastination web-
site. In a fit of despair you
decided to attempt that
degree you came here to
do. Unfortunately you dis-
cover that you’re not very
good at it. How irritating.
This week you’re sat in the
computer lab coding away.
LOL JK that’s only on your
screen when your lab supervi-
sor walks past. You flick back
to MailOnline and look at how
revealing Tulisa’s dress was
on X-Factor. Stowing it safely
away in your wank-bank,
you get back to work reddit.
This week you’re suspicious
of a slight stinging sensation
when you pee. You nip to the
STI clinic at Chelsea & West-
minster hospital where to your
surprise it turns out you had
a small colony of bats nest-
ing up there for like 3 months
now. You regret sleeping with
Christian Bale, but not for long.
This week, you resolve to over-
come your obsession with the
Olson Twins, okay they’re hot
but the fact you can quote
their 1995 film “It Takes Two”
in its entirety is a bit weird,
and it’s beginning to creep
out your boyfriend when you
do it in your sleep. Also Mary-
Kate killed Heath Ledger :(
This week you lose a bet
and have to write your
lab report in the “Papy-
rus” font. Instead of just
giving you a low mark,
the PhD marker finds out
where you live and clubs
you to death with a ty-
pography style guide.
This week you decide to “Fa-
cebook rape” some guy in
the computer room. Unfortu-
nately it’s not 2009 anymore
and everyone thinks you’re
a massive douché and not
particularly funny. Also misap-
propriating the word “rape” is
abhorrent and you should be
ashamed of yourself, frankly.
This week you get Twit-
ter. Finally! Now you know
what all those cool kids
are on about. Within min-
utes you’ve gotten into a
public argument with Piers
Morgan and Gary Linekar,
and had legal proceed-
ings taken out against you
by Tom Daley. #Banter
This week your Movember
is coming along nicely, un-
til all of a sudden you realise
you’ve completely forgotten
to raise any money. Come on
chaps, this isn’t a month long
excuse to piss off our girl-
friends; this is a serious charity
fundraiser. LOL DW I’M JOK-
ING: I don’t have a girlfriend
This week you win the US
General Election, good work
dude. Now just sort out the
economy, step back from stu-
pid brinkmanship with your
political opponents and stop
ordering the extra-judicial
killings of citizens of neu-
tral states by UAVs and then
maybe you’ll deserve your job.

It has to be
commented that
the cat is a good
effort. But just
think about how
many people will
see long hair,
shirt raised...
and get pretty
excited, only to
be disappointed.
In the words of
the latest Bond
villain: think
on your sins.
Seriously, think.
