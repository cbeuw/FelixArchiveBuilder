Politicians have legal immunity for a reason. We should call them
out when they abuse it.
Adam Clancy
Parliamentary privilege my arse
hen the ex-
penses scan-
dal originally
broke in 2009,
my opinion was
succinctly summarised by a Guard-
ian feature wherein an MP of the time
described the story as a “wonderful
moment of British ﬁddling, but more
on a Dad’s Army scale than the real
corruption of politics.” Yes, the MPs
had decided against buying their own
hobnobs/tampons/moats but MP pay
is poor for a thankless, gruelling job
and I envisioned the majority of ex-
penses as a deserved bonus. Not to
mention the whole thing was worth
it to oﬃcially see that toilet seats
were not designed to support John
Prescott.
The exception was of course second
homes, with four MPs and two Lords
jailed for false accounting (although
notably David Laws escaped crimi-
nal action despite renting his second
home out to his partner). Here, peo-
ple had stepped beyond taking lib-
erties with reclaiming work-related
moats and had willingly and crimi-
nally abused their position for ﬁnan-
cial gain to the cost of the taxpayer. In
R v Chaytor it was argued that these
MPs could hide behind Parliamentary
privilege which says that MPs cannot
be charged for what they say in Parlia-
ment and parliamentary paperwork
cannot be used as evidence in court.
They were told to MTFU [sic] by the
Supreme Court, sent to jail and the
whole debacle was put to bed.
And now it has been reawakened
by a Mr MacShane: the very man who
once eloquently described expenses as
a Dad’s Army scale issue. It is alleged
that he willingly deceived with 19 of
his invoices, a markedly more serious
allegation than telling the truth about
taking advantage of expenses. He too
looks like he will be employing Par-
liamentary privilege as his ﬁrst line of
defence against any potential criminal
charge, which seems ridiculous given
the precedent set down earlier in the
same scandal. The unfortunate thing
however, isn’t just that he could be
successful in his defence, but that he
is employing it at all.
Immunity from prosecution is im-
portant for political heavyweights,
as lawmakers must be able to throw
anything up for debate with unlim-
ited free speech and ambassadors
must know that they can continue
their mission without the possibil-
ity of false accusations tarring their
role. The problem is that some of the
elite few fail to recognise this is a two
way street. These rules are there to
protect the integrity of the oﬃce, not
the freedom of its occupier. Anyone
oﬀered such a shield can and should
use it when they have held themselves
to a higher moral standard but should
not cower behind it when they have
sullied the position itself.
In an ideal world, people granted
such a position would agree to forgo
their get-out-of-jail-free card when
they know themselves to be guilty,
but expecting such self-sacriﬁce
would be naïve. Realistically how-
W
ever, we can at least expect the state
to hold its representatives account-
able. In 1997 a Georgian ambassa-
dor killed a girl through drink driv-
ing and Georgia waived immunity as
they knew he was in the wrong – it is
this behaviour that lends diplomatic
immunity a great deal of credibility.
Similarly, should MacShane be tried,
I believe the state has every right to
waive a law as he is abusing his privi-
lege as much as he allegedly abused
his ﬁnancial power. If he did nothing
criminal, let him prove it himself. If
he is guilty, I don’t want him to walk
free by sacriﬁcing the integrity of our
laws.
Laughing all the
way to court
Sirs,
I know not whether any of your avid
readers venture past Big Sainsbury’s
on Cromwell Road, but I simply must
take the opportunity to thoroughly
whinge about the Big Tesco near
Earls Court. Imagine my dismay
upon venturing inside those walls of
capitalism when it emerged that the
layout has been changed – yet again!
Allegedly it is for our own benefit. A
new pharmacy has been promised,
alongside the intriguingly named
‘Euphorium Bakery’, or something to
that effect at least. I simply cannot
carry out my shopping in peace when
faced with so much constant change
at every opportunity. Perhaps I will
have to take my business to the self-
service tills of Big Sainsbury’s, or even
(gasp!) Tesco Express on Gloucester
Road.
Yours in triumphant worry,
A consumer
Sir,
I would like to express my annoy-
ance with those members of college
who seem unable to grasp the way
in which transport around campus
operates. I am speaking, of course,
about those who insist on travelling
to pivotal high-traffic areas, before
pausing there to engage in a jovial
chat, while on either side of them
something akin to a freeway pile-up
develops.
A particularly egregious exam-
ple of this is the Sherfield atrium,
in which dozens of people can have
their journey abruptly halted, so
that Michael can tell Paul how many
yards of ale he downed the night be-
fore.
Such flagrant obstruction of
a major transportation conduit
would certainly not be tolerated on
the road, and neither should it be
around campus. Therefore I propose
the launching of a public-informa-
tion campaign, in order to inform
students and staff of the many harms
of inconsiderate walking.
For instance, at the top and bottom
of the Sherfield stairway, we could
position some signs reading: “Please
do not enter this staircase unless you
are committed to traversing its entire
length without stopping.” This would
certainly give those who might other-
wise have not considered the conse-
quences of their actions some pause
for thought.
Yours,
A concerned citizen
