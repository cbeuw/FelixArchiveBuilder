Madagascar 3: Europe’s
Most Wanted
Directors: Eric Darnell, Tom
McGrath, Conrad Vernon
Screenwriters: Eric Darnell, Noah
Baumbach
Starring: (voices) Ben Stiller, Chris
Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith, David
Schwimmer
So the ﬁrst one was good, and the sec-
ond one was ok. But let’s face it, by the
time the third ﬁlm in a franchise turns
up, nobody is expecting very much.
But Madagascar 3 is surprisingly
good – so good in fact that it currently
holds the number two spot in the UK
Box Oﬃce.
The dynamic quartet of Alex the lion
(Stiller), Gloria the hippo (Pinkett-
Smith), Melman the giraﬀe (Schwim-
mer) and Marty the zebra (Rock) are
back for this third installment, and
are still trying to get home to Amer-
ica from Africa, via…Monte Carlo.
Which doesn’t seem hugely logical
but, hey – the animals can talk, so
we’re not nit-picking here. The new
adventure begins when the gang lie
low in a travelling circus, ruled over by
an eastern European tiger called Vi-
taly (Bryan Cranston), who once had
a rather strange act involving jump-
ing through an impossibly small hoop
while slicked with olive oil. Make of
that what you will. The ever amusing
Sacha Baron Cohen makes a return-
ing appearance as the eccentric King
Julien the ring-tailed lemur, and the
whole cast working together make it
a happy, cheery ﬁlm for all the family
(with a couple of little innuendos that
are likely to ﬂy over children’s heads,
but make mum and dad snigger).
Madagascar 3 is modest and down-
to-earth, and clearly wasn’t expect-
ing much from the box oﬃce, but has
fortunately become a big success. The
great script from Eric Darnell and
Noah Baumbach proves itself, with
lots of laughs and a few tender mo-
ments, and the energy of the whole
ﬁlm is endearing. A bright, colourful,
enthusiastic ﬁlm – and certainly one
to catch.

Taken 2
Director: Olivier Megaton
Screenwriters: Luc Besson, Robert
Mark Karmen
Starring: Liam Neeson, Famke
Janssen, Maggie Grace
Producer Luc Besson and director
Olivier Megaton had a smash hit on
their hands with 2008’s Taken, star-
ring Liam Neeson as the ex-CIA guy
whose daughter was kidnapped by
traﬃckers in Europe. Needless to say,
Liam went after the bad guys, found
them and killed them. Sorted. It was
such a success that a sequel was inevi-
table – and it’s got a strange twist, this
one. This time around, it’s Liam who’s
got himself kidnapped, and his daugh-
ter who is trying to save him.
Chained up in a dark, damp base-
ment in Istanbul (while his Turkish
abductors casually watch football
in the next room), Liam whips out a
tiny hidden mobile phone, calls his
daughter and tells her to get hold of
his guns and grenades – and come
and ﬁnd him. Which is odd when you
consider that, in the ﬁrst ﬁlm, Liam
barely wanted his daughter to leave
the house incase of danger – but now
he’s inviting her into a practical sui-
cide mission.
Neeson, being the ever professional
actor, puts just as much eﬀort into this
performance as his much more serious
roles (such as Oskar Schindler), but
even he can’t save this one. The ﬁrst
movie, box oﬃce hit though it may
have been, was a bit pants. This one
is ridiculous, and the premise is a lit-
tle tired. Not only that, but the saving
grace of the ﬁrst ﬁlm was Liam’s casual
attitude to a bit of torture – electrocu-
tion, a few beatings etc – which made
the ﬁlm a 15, but Taken 2 is a 12A, and
nowhere near as fun and gory. It’s safe
to say that this tamer, sillier version of
Taken is a bit of a disappointment.

Disney buys Lucasﬁlm
Lucy Wiles Film Editor
Veteran ﬁlm maker George Lucas has
agreed to sell his company Lucasﬁlms
– the company behind the entire Star
Wars franchise – to Walt Disney,
who will be making a seventh ﬁlm in
the series, to be released in 2015.
Lucasﬁlm, which is entirely owned
by Lucas, will be added to Disney’s
ever-increasing portfolio of brands,
which now includes ESPN, Pixar and
Marvel, among others. “Lucasﬁlm
reﬂects the extraordinary passion, vi-
sion, and storytelling of its founder,
George Lucas,” Robert Iger, Disney’s
Chairman and Chief Executive said.
“This transaction combines a world-
class portfolio of content including
Star Wars, one of the greatest family
entertainment franchises of all time,
with Disney’s unique and unparal-
leled creativity.”
Mr Lucas commented that he felt
as though he was passing on the Star
Wars torch (lightsaber?) to a new
generation of ﬁlmmakers at Disney.
“For the past 35 years, one of my
greatest pleasures has been to see
Star Wars passed from one genera-
tion to the next,” he is quoted as say-
ing. “I’ve always believed that Star
Wars could live beyond me, and I
thought it was important to set up
the transition during my lifetime.”
Mr Lucas, who now intends to retire,
believes that the deal means the fran-
chise (which has produced nothing
new since the slightly disappointing
Star Wars: The Clone Wars in 2008)
could continue and develop well:
“Disney’s reach and experience give
Lucasﬁlm the opportunity to blaze
new trails in ﬁlm, television, interac-
tive media, theme parks, live enter-
tainment, and consumer products,”
he adds. Kathleen Kennedy, the cur-
rent Co-Chairman of Lucasﬁlm, will
become President of the company
when it becomes part of Disney af-
ter the takeover, and as such will be
reporting to the Walt Disney Studios
Chairman, Alan Horn. The deal also
includes the much smaller Industrial
Light & Magic, the pioneering spe-
cial eﬀects group that has been at
the forefront of ﬁlm-making since its
work on Star Wars in the 1970s.
The Star Wars ﬁlms in the long-
running franchise and their subse-
quent re-releases have created nearly
$5bn in global ticket sales, according
to data analysed by Bloomberg. Mr
Iger said Disney intended to keep
the operation, as well as LucasArts,
which produces computer games
such as Lego Star Wars, Star Wars:
The Force Unleashed and Star Wars
Battlefront. Shares in The Walt Dis-
ney Company closed on Friday at
$50.08, valuing the entertainment
group at $89.9bn.
