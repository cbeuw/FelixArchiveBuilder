mperial College has been
found to charge the most for
their International student
tuition fees out of the Russell
group universities. The data
shows that Imperial’s international
students who do clinical medicine are
charged a massive £39,150.
International fees are broken down
into bands. Band 1 is class-room based
subjects and include humanities and
social sciences. Band 2 is laboratory
based subjects and applies to most of
the courses at Imperial, for example
Chemistry or Engineering.
Medicine is broken up into pre-clini-
cal and clinical medicine and for some
universities there is a diﬀerence be-
tween the fees. Clinical medicine usu-
ally costs a great deal more than pre-
clinical medicine and is consistently
the highest of the international fees.
For Band 2 subjects, Imperial charg-
es their international students £25,000
which is followed by the University of
Cambridge which costs £19,800. The
lowest is £10,600 from Queen Mary’s
University.
International fees are known to be
substantially higher than Home stu-
dents but this is due to the fact that
the government subsidises the fees for
Home students.
European Union (EU) students also
count as Home students and pay the
same fees. Non-EU students count as
International students, even if their
country is in Europe but not a part of
the EU.
An anonymous biomedical student
said, “I’d much rather pay less but then
taking into account the prestige, the
environment and such things, I felt a
lot more at home here than compared
to Oxbridge. It’s silly, I don’t get why
they charge so much to be honest.”
Compared to Oxbridge, the raw
fees for Imperial are still higher than
both Oxford andCambridge. How-
ever, Oxbridge have additional col-
lege fees(£6157 for Cambridge and
£4500-5500 for Oxford) which means
that the overall costs of Oxbridge are
higher than Imperial. When the living
expenses of London are taken into ac-
count, Imperial still comes out on top.
A third year medical student, Minaal
Khan said “International fees are ridic-
ulously high as everyone knows, but
when applying I don’t think I realised
how high they really were and I know
it will take me over 10 years to make
the amount of money I have spent on
coming to university! But I don’t regret
choosing this ﬁeld because you can’t
put a price on the beneﬁts that are
given to me by having this education”.
Another student, who wished to re-
main anonymous, replied: “There is
no doubt that international students
should pay more as their places are not
subsidized by the government in any-
way. However, I do not really see how
this comes to £23,500 a year even in
comparison to new £9, 000 home fees.
In addition, tuition fees keep going up
every year by a considerable amount as
for me this year ended up being over
a £1000 more expensive than the last
one. We’ll see what is there to come
next year.”
Imperial College London were asked
about the fees and the reason for the
disparity, and replied with: “When the
International Recruitment team visits
overseas schools, we are often asked
why there is such a diﬀerence between
Home and Overseas fees. Firstly, it is
important to note that UK government
still partially funds Home and EU stu-
dents at universities in England. Al-
though with the new £9000 fees Home
and EU students are shouldering more
of the ﬁnancial burden of paying for
their teaching than they were previ-
ously, they are still not paying the full
costs of running the courses.
The reasons behind the disparities

between Imperial’s overseas fees and
those of our direct competitors are a
bit more complex. Although London
is a very expensive city, we are aware
that London is also home to some of
our Russell Group colleagues whose
fees diﬀer from ours. The bottom line
is that the vast majority of Imperial’s
courses are quite expensive to teach
given our focus on STEM subjects,
whereas other multi-Faculty institu-
tions oﬀer a variety of arts courses
which can in eﬀect subsidise the other
Faculties. Being at a specialist univer-
sity has many beneﬁts however includ-
ing excellent job prospects after grad-
uation. We would hope that students
see the value in being part of such an
elite technical institution and make
the most of their time with us by tak-
ing advantage of all the academic and
non-academic opportunities Imperial
has to oﬀer.”
As has been previously reported in
Felix, the job prospects for Imperial
graduates are very high compared to
competing universities.
