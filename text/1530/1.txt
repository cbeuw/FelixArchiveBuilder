Higher Education Achievement Re-
cord (HEAR) have recently been sug-
gested as an alternative to just receiv-
ing a single grade.
Following GCSEs and A-levels, uni-
versities experience grade inﬂation
with the last graduation being the
most successful ever with ﬁrst class
degrees being awarded to a sixth of
students which is more than twice
the number seen a decade ago. As a
result, degrees seem to be losing their
value making it very hard for the em-
ployers to distinguish between good
and bad job applicants.
In 2007, Universities UK and Guild-
HE in their report came up with a
solution which was to introduce a
new Higher Education Achievement
Record (HEAR) which extrapolates
further the idea of the European Di-
ploma Supplement and represents a
school-type report which will come in
addition to the degree transcript. The
document will include all the extra-
curriculum achievements including
relevant work experience, volunteer-
ing, prizes and positions held at the
clubs and societies throughout a stu-
dent’s time at university. As for the
academic matters, the report will aim
to give a better insight into the taken
degree and the progress accomplished
throughout by providing the informa-
tion about every module and exam
taken. It is thought that the introduc-
tion of the scheme would encourage
students to participate more fully in
the university life taking full ad-
