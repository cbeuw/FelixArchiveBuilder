Colour change test for HIV
should accurately notify the public
on the harms done by certain drugs:
a more harmful drug should be in a
higher class. In reality, Prof Nutt ar-
gues, much of the time harms are
little considered and moral reasons
are provided for the classiﬁcation of
drugs instead. His book does not at-
tempt to convince people that taking
drugs is a fun thing to do (something
that was misunderstood by a lot of
the critics of Channel 4’s live ecstasy
trial). Instead, Prof Nutt argues for a
drugs policy that is based on evidence
and that indicates the harm posed by
each drug. He also argues that the cur-
rent “War on Drugs”, while being set
up in good intentions, has had many
negative eﬀects: the criminalisation of
young people; the lack of proper care
for drug addicts; and the lack of fund-

FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER

It turned out that 52% of the audience
at a recent event at the Dana Centre
would prefer to be executed by lethal
injection than hanging, electrocution
or being shot. This was before they
were given information about what
exactly occurs when a lethal injection
is carried out.
A member of the audience was se-
lected to lie on a death bed with a plas-
tic arm to demonstrate venous can-
nulation. Tim Crocker-Buque, Junior
Doctor and Public health researcher
chaired the evening and then showed
how the lethal cocktail is adminis-
tered.
Felicity Plaat, consultant anaesthe-
tist with the Imperial College Health-
care NHS Trust described the drugs
used in the procedure. She then ex-
plained the huge problems when in-
jections are being administered by
prison wardens, who are not medi-
cally trained, causing undue suﬀering
to dying prisoners.
It is diﬃcult to judge the speciﬁc
amount of anaesthetic which is need-
ed, and sometimes prisoners wake up
during their execution. As they are
injected with enough drug to para-
lyse their striated muscles for a week,
they have no way of indicating their
consciousness. Finally, a high dose of
potassium decelerates heart palpita-
tions until it completely stops and the
prisoner dies. However if the cannu-
lation is not completely in a vein, po-
tassium leak-out can induce death of
surrounding tissue which is terribly
painful.
Despite the fact that these drugs
come from medical application, it was
surprising to ﬁnd out from Vivienne
Nathanson, Director of Professional
Activities at the British Medical As-
sociation, that doctors must not take
part in administering lethal injections
because it is an abuse of their medical
knowledge. However, they are able to
conﬁrm death and can even prescribe
the deadly drugs to prisons.
Many US prisons are having dif-
ﬁculty in carrying out executions as
they have depleted their drug supply
and cannot source new supplies, as

An intelligent discussion on the
harms of legal and illegal drugs
Until the recent “Ecstasy Live” TV
show, Professor David Nutt was
best known as “the scientist who got
sacked”. After giving a lecture that
discussed the harms of cannabis, Prof
Nutt was asked (by the then Home
Secretary, Alan Johnson) to resign as
Chair of the Advisory Council on the
Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The irony,
as discussed in Drugs Without The Hot
Air was that Prof Nutt was sacked for
advising the government on policy,
which as he understood was the pur-
pose of the ACMD.
Prof Nutt’s book explores new
methods for reducing the harm of le-
gal and illegal drugs. This starts with
a critique of the current classiﬁca-
tion system for drugs. This system
ing into therapies for people living
with mental-health disorders, such a
depression and schizophrenia.
His book contains a broad, varied
and detailed discussion of the eﬀects,
histories and harms of legal and illegal
drugs. I found the chapters on the his-
tories of cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine
particularly interesting as they show
that, all too often, the legal status of
a drug is decided not by using scien-
tiﬁc evidence, but also through moral,
political and corporate ideologies. I
have recommended this book to a lot
of my friends as it’s an intelligent dis-
cussion of drugs policy is rarely found
within other media. Equally, the hope-
ful way Prof Nutt writes leads me to
believe that our politicians will, quite
soon, invoke a truly evidence-based
approach to drug policy.
kalwnews.org
was presented by Maya Fao, head of
the Stop the Lethal Injection Project
at Reprieve UK. Each time the prisons
try to buy drugs, the non-proﬁt organ-
isation tries to block this by writing to
the suppliers and governments aﬀect-
ed. So far they have been successful.
European countries ban these exports
and many pharmaceutical companies
are unwilling to tarnish their reputa-
tion for money from executioners. Re-
cently, the US government tried con-
cocting the lethal cocktail themselves,
but this did not produce a successful
execution.
As a result, only 24% of the Dana
Centre audience decided that they
would prefer to be executed by lethal
injection.

Accidental

A new, cheap method of detecting
ultralow concentrations of HIV and
some cancers through a colour chang-
ing solution, visible to the human eye,
has been developed by biomedical en-
gineers at Imperial College.
The test relies on a solution that
changes colour depending on whether
or not the biomarker, an indicator of
the disease, is present — red for nega-
tive, blue for positive. The solution
was able to detect concentrations of
both HIV biomarker p24 and pros-
tate-speciﬁc antigen, a biomarker for
prostate cancer, at ultralow concen-
tration of 1 × 10-18
g ml-1
, far lower
than the concentrations detectable via
current gold-standard tests.
The solution uses gold nanoparticles
as a method of detection. If the bio-
marker is present the gold nanoparti-
cles aggregate into irregular clumps,
producing a blue-tone, i.e. a positive
result. If the biomarker isn’t present
the nanoparticles form spherical, non-
aggregated structures that produce a
red tone, i.e. a negative result. As can
be seen on the image to the right, the

colour change is visible to the naked
eye and not just a machine. The actual
test would use a disposable vial capa-
ble of analysing serum derived from
the patient’s blood.
The potential impact on HIV-rav-
aged nations cannot be understated.
Current methods of HIV detection,
especially at ultralow concentrations,
are expensive and require sophisticat-
ed equipment. As a result many coun-
tries cannot aﬀord to have a reliable
system of testing; the colour change
solution test is predicted to be around
ten times cheaper than current meth-
ods. As quoted by Dr Roberto de la
Rica, one of the principal research-
ers: “This test could be signiﬁcantly
cheaper to administer, which could
pave the way for more widespread use
of HIV testing in poorer parts of the
world.”
The research team are now looking
towards not-for-proﬁt global health
organizations for additional funding,
and help to bring the test from the lab
and into the nations that need it the
most.
