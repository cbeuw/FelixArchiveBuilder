FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER
12
ou’d think that ‘anti-
war’ would be a pretty
easy position to present,
wouldn’t you? When
you think of things that
we name Horsemen of the Apocalypse
after, it’s not exactly a list of things that
split opinion. There is no pro-Pestilence
lobby. There is no Society for the Ad-
vancement of Famine. Famine especial-
ly, Famine’s a right dick. Keeps enough
food around to keep an undead horse
running for all eternity, and then goes
around taking away everyone else’s din-
ner? That’s the sort of thing that makes
it hard to run Horseman PR eﬀectively.
I digress. Of all the Horsemen that
the Bible mentions, War doesn’t stand
out as one that is particularly defensi-
ble. When you look at his discography,
it’s a greatest hits list littered with more
genuine war crimes than the average
Eighties mix that used to pass for music
in the Felix oﬃce. Scientists being paid
to research gases that shut down human
respiratory systems; mass acceptance
of genocide and the killing of civilians;
shady deals that prolong bloodshed and
suﬀering in order to beneﬁt the few.
War is shit. I don’t even know why I’m
arguing this like it’s a contentious posi-
tion. Everyone knows that war is shit.
One of the things I respected over
the years was wearing poppies in No-
vember. For those of you who might
be spending their ﬁrst November in
the UK, every year around this time we
make donations to a charity in exchange
for a bright red paper poppy, which we
pin onto our clothes in the days leading
up to the 11th November – a special day
marking the end of World War One.
Poppies became iconic largely thanks to
a poem describing the ﬂowers that grew
in the battleﬁelds of the ﬁrst World
War, fertilised with the blood and gore
of man’s inhumanity to man. We wear
paper versions of the blood-red ﬂowers
to remember the huge sacriﬁces that
were made to ﬁght relatively morally-
straightforward ﬁghts in defence of
people.
That was how it used to be. I’d hap-
pily wear a ﬂower each and every year,
because the two World Wars fought at
the start of the last century were really
Y
Remembrance and regret
Remembrance day is increasingly going against its original
meaning, argues Angry Geek
shit ideas. Only a mounted dickbag like
War could come up with a concept so
utterly stupid as the ﬁrst one, and then
follow up with the worst second album
anyone has ever seen. Why am I even
arguing this with you. There is no way
anyone on this planet thinks those wars
were good ideas. That’s why we wore
poppies. That’s why we fell silent every
year on the 11th November. That’s why
we donate money to charity, to help out
the few soldiers that remain that fought
in those wars, that oﬀered themselves
up to defend the world at large.
But things have changed. Under-
standably so in some ways – the char-
ity behind the Poppy Appeal, the Brit-
ish Legion, have had to change tack as
the last few soldiers from World War
One pass away, and the veterans of
World War Two begin to follow suit.
Now they have a diﬀerent duty - to
look after the soldiers who fought in
the wars that came after, right up to
the ones we ﬁnd ourselves in today.
That poses a problem, however. Where
we once fought wars against unspeak-
able evil, in genuine defence not just
of our country but of all countries,
we now ﬁnd ourselves being asked to
remember and help out people who
fought in far murkier wars. Wars fur-
ther aﬁeld. Wars fought in pursuit of
less noble goals. Wars we are told are
being fought for our beneﬁt.
The shift in the advertising tone of
the Poppy Appeal, from one of remem-
brance and regret that war happens, to
one of optimism and support for the
‘heroes’ ﬁghting in modern arenas, is
one that will leave me behind. I won’t
be wearing or buying a poppy this year,
and nor should you. While the char-
ity still does good work, the attitude it
adopts and wishes us to adopt is not one
that is healthy. It is a sloppy mix of dark
patriotism and an implied support of
anything done by a soldier allied to the
British army.
The reason we wore poppies, so I
thought, was to remember that war is
ugly, unnecessary, and a last resort. Pop-
pies were supposed to be a begrudging
nod to the fact that War is a arsehole,
not a suggestion that his horse needs
a good stroke and a fresh saddlebag
of mangled corpses to munch on. The
closer we get to associating Remem-
brance Day with condoning or support-
ing the actions of those who serve today,
the further we get from what I feel the
ceremony should really be about, and
the closer we come to being a country
like America, a nation of people who
erupt in tear-ﬁlled elation at the news
of people being murdered by their na-
tions’s armed forces.
War is hell. Don’t let anyone trick you
into thinking otherwise.
The reason
we wore
