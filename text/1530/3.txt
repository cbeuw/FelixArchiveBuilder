FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER
An Imperial College physicist was
killed in a car crash in Austalia in the
early hours of 19 October 2012. Dr
Sean Barrett, a Royal Society Univer-
sity Research Fellow and a member
of the Controlled Quantum Dynam-
ics Group, had been in the country
for less than an hour when the taxi
he was in was hit by a speeding 4x4
that had previously ran a red light. Dr
Barrett, 36, and his driver, Kuldeep
Singh, are believed to have died in-
stantly.
The larger car had been reported
stolen on 16 October 2012 and police
believe it had been used in a number
of crimes prior to the crash. The car
had been involved in a high-speed
chase with the authorities, but the
police withdrew when continuing
was deemed to dangerous. The driver,
who was taken to a local hospital with
broken legs, has been charged with
manslaughter.
In a statement, Assistant Police
Commissioner Gary Budge said that
the police chase ended “a long, long
way from where the crash occurred”.
He added: “It is diﬃcult to imagine
the trauma that two families must be
feeling out there today. I want to pass
on my condolences to both of those
families and tell them we will provide
all the support that is possible to both
of them.”
Dr Barrett had studied at Cam-
bridge University for his undergradu-
ate and postgraduate degree. His
doctoral work was on quantum in-
formation processing in a condensed
matter system. He moved on to a
junior position at HP Labs in Bristol,
and after an initial spell at Imperial,
eventually returned to Imperial Col-
lege London where he held the Royal
Society University Research Fellow-
ship. At the time of the accident, he
had only been lecturing for one year.
Dr Barret had been due to speak
at a quantum physics conference the
following week. In light of his death
the conference was rededicated in
his memory. The Universities of
Western Australia and Queensland,
who organised the event, released a
statement praising “Sean’s strength
of character and insight”. It went on
to say: “He was at the height of his
career and leaves an outstanding re-
search record. His tragic and sudden
death is a profound loss to the re-
search community.”
A statement from Imperial College
also praised Dr Barrett’s research,
adding: “His loss will be greatly felt
by the scientiﬁc community. Our
thoughts and condolences are with
Dr Barrett’s family, friends and col-
leagues at this tragic time.”
Professor Myungshik Kin and Dr
Terry Rudolph wrote a tribute to
their friend and colleague on the Im-
perial College website. In this, they
described working with him as “a joy”
and remembered that he “organised
Wednesday breakfast meetings for
the Controlled Quantum Dynamics
groups for two years”. They said that
“his hugely charismatic personality
was a crucial part of their success”.
They ended the tribute by saying:
“We will miss Sean’s humour, his re-
liability, his basic ‘mateship’ and his
fundamental decency as a human be-
ing”.
Speaking to the Manchester Even-
ing News, his mother, Jan Barrett,
described her great loss saying: “Eve-
rybody absolutely loved him and had
great respect for the work he was
doing. He would have gone on to do
more great things.” A statement from
the family added: “[Sean] was a char-
ismatic man who had the rare gift to
light up any room. He is a loss to sci-
ence, and to life. He was cut short in
his prime. Rightly, his family, friends
and his colleagues whom he leaves
behind are devastated.”

Most kisses in one minute record broken at Imperial
On Tuesday 6 November 2012, Sa-
rah Greasley, a newly arrived PhD
student in the Materials department
at Imperial, broke a World Record in
Ethos. The record was for most kisses
received in one minute. Shockingly,
at Imperial there must have been
plenty of men out there willing to
help her achieve this aim.
Sarah told Felix via email that she
is “really happy” about the feat, and
that she “would like to thank every-
one who helped, especially those who
agreed to come along at the last mo-
ment!”
Sarah had previously broken three
Guinness World Records. The three
records were all broken last year.
These were for most sticky notes on
the body simultaneously, most CDs
ﬂipped and caught in one minute,
and most champagne bottles opened
in one minute. She had previously at-
tempted the most kisses received in
one minute record, however the re-
cord was discounted due to techni-
calities. Therefore she re-attempted
to break the record, and was success-
ful.
