Imperial students create online learning database

Students who met at Imperial College
have created a website oﬀering free
online education courses.
The Open Academy (theopenacade-
my.com) is a free-to-use website with
over 7000 classes and covering a range
of topics including Science, Mathe-
matics, Engineering, Law, Arts, Medi-
cine, Social Sciences and the Humani-
ties. Representing 20 of the world’s
top universities, The Open Academy
has lecture material including videos,
slides, exercises and practice exams,
from introductory to advanced level.
They are not the ﬁrst to do this. In
2002 MIT announced that it would
be “opening” its classrooms, oﬀering
its courses online for free. Since then,
others have followed suit including
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford
and Columbia. The movement has
now reached over 200 universities
across continents. MIT and Harvard
have recently joined forces to cre-
ate the online resource EdX – set-
ting aside $60million and aiming to
“educate 1 billion people around the
world”.
Individuals have also started to
teach online for all subjects, from
music to maths. Salman Khan, an
MIT alumnus, quit his job at a hedge
fund to teach on YouTube, eventually
founding the Khan Academy.
The Open Academy was found-
ed on similar ideals. They say that
educational background deﬁnes “so
much of us”. The team say they were
keen to oﬀer people the opportunity
to educate themselves at their own
pace. They said: “Having all the avail-
able educational resources under our
hands made sense as this was the way
we learned. Making a website out of it
just came as a natural outcome. This
was something that we wanted to ex-
ist.”
The students came up with the idea
in 2011, and gathered people that
they thought could help them. They
then worked on building the website
during the summer. “By December we
had the ﬁrst version of the site ready
with enough material to take it live,
but not enough to bring it to the level
that we wanted it to be”.
At present 7 people are working on
the project, handling programming,
legal issues and PR, as well as contin-
uing research and development. With
one of the creators of the site saying “I
spend about 20 hours a week on the
project”.
All of the material is arranged on
the website by subject. The team hope
to expand the website as much as pos-
sible, building up an extensive library
of PDF notes and exercises. Open
Academy hope to pursue partner-
ships with the universities themselves
(it already oﬀers some courses run by
Oxford) and help them expand their
online presence.
The hope is to for the amount of
content on the website to increase,
and say that they have “a bunch of
ideas that we think will enhance user
interactiveness and at the same time
create new content”.
They say they are “really excited”
about all of the future plans that they
have, but don’t want to “spoil the sur-
prise”.
The Open Academy team ended by
saying: “The Open Academy a truly
diverse and unique academic centre in
the Web. We realized the sheer num-
ber of things that can be done to en-
rich it and have never been as excited
about it as we are now. “
