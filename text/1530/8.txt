FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER
Let me start by introducing
myself, I am Becky Lane
and I am this year’s Deputy
President (Welfare) and
I have just ﬁnished my
Physics degree at Imperial College.
Although my experiences here as an
undergraduate here at Imperial have
generally been ﬁne (aside from the
OH-MY-GOD-EXAMS-ARE-SO-
BAD) there are times that I have felt
marginalised because of my gender. I
seemed to blunder through the years
of my undergraduate course in bliss-
ful ignorance of this undercurrent of
sexism, which I feel is often part of the
Imperial culture. In my little bubble of
friends I remained on the whole obliv-
ious, until I stepped into the spotlight
cast by Union politics and elections. I
was generally an outsider to the Un-
ion fold before I ran for my Sabbatical
position. I won’t dredge up the past,
but during campaigning I was sub-
jected to derogatory comments based
upon my gender. I was incredibly an-
gry, taking the point of view that I am
happy for people to criticise me based
upon my views, but not my looks.
This year, the Physics society has
already been mentioned in the Inde-
pendent regarding an email sent out
which caused oﬀence to some female
ﬁrst year students and rightly so. The
Sexism call for evidence
launched at Imperial
attitudes towards this email that I have
come across have been at times quite
frankly horrifying. Such as ‘the person
who sent this email was a female so
therefore it can’t be sexist’. Comments
of this nature are not down to the gen-
der of the person that made them or
indeed the intent of how they were
made; the only concern should be that
individuals found them oﬀensive. I
am proud to say that this year things
are being highlighted to me passed on
from the Gender Equality oﬃcer; it
worries me that in the past incidents
may have gone unreported.
So, what are we going to do? I can’t
help but feel that there might be a cul-
tural issue here at Imperial. Is it be-
cause we are an institution with the
percentage of females ﬂuctuating be-
tween 34-36%? Honestly I don’t know
but I want to ﬁnd out. The answer I
feel is not to hold a Sexism survey,
but to adopt the approach that the
government takes when gathering
information about Higher Education.
So this article is here to introduce my
call for evidence. The email account
sexism@imperial.ac.uk is now active.
I am happy to receive anonymous or
named responses from any student or
staﬀ member who would like to get
down their attitudes towards sexism
and experiences of gender discrimina-
Becky Lane, Deputy President (Welfare) launches a call for every-
one, lecturers and students, to share their experiences of sexism
tion and Imperial College.
I might be completely oﬀ the mark
here but I hope to gain answers to
some of these questions. Is Impe-
rial College a sexist environment? At
times do both male and female stu-
dents fell discriminated against be-
cause of their gender? Have you ever
felt during your studies you have been
treated diﬀerently because of your
gender? These are just some of the
questions that I hope to get the an-
swers to.
Making a call for evidence is all very
well and good, but what am I going
to do with this information? Well I
plan to display the submissions in a
public place in College in an artistic
Millions of pounds of extra
funding for Imperial
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Imperial are to be one of twelve
universities that are going to ben-
eﬁt from £6m of funding from the
Higher Education Funding Council
for England (HEFCE).
In a speech at the UUK conference,
David Willetts, Mnister for Univer-
sities and Science, announced that
HEFCE will give the highest per-
forming universities in knowledge
exchange an additional £6m. Impe-
rial was amongst the twelve universi-
ties that will be allocated the fund-
ing. The aim of the extra funding, as
stated on the HEFCE website, is to
“stimulate economic growth through
research commercialisation activi-
ties”.
Imperial was one of the highest per-
forming universities in the area of
knowledge exchange.

(Welfare) way; I also plan to produce the Sexism
@ Imperial report to present to Col-
lege. An institutional problem needs
an institutional shift in attitude to
make a change. This is also creating
an anonymous way for students to re-
port issues of sexism even after the re-
port is made. To make an anonymous
submission you can just create a hot-
mail account merely for the purpose
of making the submission, or if you
send it from your personal account
your name will never be mentioned.
The only people with access will be
the Deputy President (Welfare) and
the Gender Equality oﬃcer. Help us
answer some of these questions and
make a diﬀerence.
Report suggests 15% cap on year abroad fees
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
A government report by Professor
Colin Riordan, Chair of the UK HE
International Unit, suggested that the
cap on fees for year abroads should be
15% of the fee charged for a normal
year, which is £9000 for most Imperial
undergraduate courses. This means
that the fee would be £1350, which
could be seen as an incentive for stu-
dents to save money by going on a year
abroad.
The new limit would be a decrease in
the current ﬁgure charged by Imperial,
which is 50%.
The aim of the reduced cap is to
boost the number of students gaining
international experience from over-
seas study.
The cap would apply to all students
doing a year abroad inside or outside
of the EU.
Professor Riordan commented:
“Studying, working or volunteering
abroad increases the employability and
ﬁnancial rewards for students in the in-
ternational labour market. Despite this
the UK ranks just 25th in the world for
the number of students studying over-
seas.” David Willetts, Universities and
Science Minister, praised year abroad
schemes as oﬀering a “huge range of
beneﬁts for students taking part” and
that they also help “our universities
and the wider UK economy”.
At the minute, it is only a suggestion
and not a law. Therefore universities
are not obliged to charge the suggested
15% cap.
