Being the First to Teach
Tim Arbabzadah gets schooled in the aims of TeachFirst
mmm, ummm,
ummm. Okay, I’ll
get off at West-
minster and
change, that will
be quick right?”. That was what was
going through my head as I franti-
cally scrambled to make it to my in-
terview with Brett Wigdortz. Turns
out I was wrong by the way (about
the trains being delayed, not having
the interview: this would be a very
short Feature if that were to have
been the case).
Having chosen probably the
weirdest way possible to get to Lon-
don Bridge, thinking that it would
be “faster”, I sat on the tube. I was
doing that thing where you nerv-
ously play music (to no avail, as
when you’re in a rush you can never
actually hear or enjoy any songs)
and fidget in the chair, willing the
tube driver to choose today to at-
tempt to break some kind of World
Record for “speediest delivery of
late man to interview”. The driver
wasn’t in any way trying to become
a World Record Holder. I guess
some just don’t have the hero genes
in them. Arsehole.
Having run out of London Bridge,
with a James Bond theme on my iP-
hone (name dropping both, terri-
ble, I know, but this is 100% true), I
promptly grabbed what all students
refer to as their one and only sav-
iour, i.e. Google Maps (thank God I
haven’t upgraded phones and don’t
have Apple Maps, I would have nev-
er arrived). I then managed to get
turned around and walked in the
complete and utter wrong direction.
A fact that didn’t register with me
until I’d walked a little bit too far.
Luckily, sort of, my phone was
ringing, so I had to look at my
screen and realise what I had done.
Unluckily, it was TeachFirst calling
to see where I was and note that I
was late for the interview. A quick
bit of apologising, and some less
than dignified walk/jogging later
– you know what I mean; it’s that
thing you do where you jog a few
metres, walk a few, jog a few, walk
a few, and so on – I was on track.
Finally, I arrived at TeachFirst’s
shiny, swish office in London. Well,
there was an incident involving me
and not being able to find the en-
trance, but that was uneventful/em-
barrassing so I won’t go into it.
Very graciously, Brett has decided
to give me his time. I feel terrible
for being late and hoped it wasn’t
too much of a bother. I walking into
the office and sat down in a modern
conference room (I even got free
water).
Brett casually walks in and greets
me, with a coffee in a Thermos flask
in his hand. He seems laid back and
that puts me at ease.
This first thing that strikes me is
that he is American. I don’t know
why this was a surprise, given his
name, but for some reason I ex-
pected him to be English because of
TeachFirst being UK. Well, that was
going to be mistake two. “One of
our alumni is opening up a Teach-
First in Australia” Brett tells me. It
turns out it’s going global in only
ten years since it’s founding.
Brett’s mother was a teacher, so
perhaps teaching has always been
in his blood. He tells me of how he
still “visits the schools that we are
working with”.
Brett tells me about how inspir-
ing it is to see the children doing
so well, and how statistics show
that great teachers do make a dif-
ference. That seems to be his vision,
that students want to go into teach-
ing. He doesn’t want it to stop just
there though. Brett explains how
he wants “the graduates to become
ambassadors”. TeachFirst, in his
mind, leads students to being inter-
ested in education for life, and not
just for however long they are at the
company and on the scheme. Brett
wants the TeachFirst graduates to
be governors of schools, or even tu-
tors in their spare time. He says he
doesn’t mind if someone does the
TeachFirst plan and then goes off to
work for a consultancy, as long as
they keep being involved in educat-
ing young people.
He believes firmly that “you can
not give up on people and forget
about those who are older”. He
doesn’t want to just target those at a
younger age and leave a generation
of children behind, he wants to be
able to get everyone from disadvan-
taged backgrounds into having bet-
ter prospects for the future. He also
talks about how there is a shortage
of highly qualified teachers in the
STEM (Science, Technology, Engi-
neering, and Medicine) subjects in
schools, particularly lower achiev-
ing schools with pupils from disad-
vantaged backgrounds.
I move the interview on to more of
the entrepreneurship side of Teach-
First to get what “buzzwords” he
would say are the most important.
A charity that has grown so quickly
is definitely, without a shadow of a
doubt, an impressive feat. Now be-
ing the third highest recruiter in the
UK, I wondered what he thought
you needed. Perseverance and hard
work are big points that he flags up
as being important for any budding
entrepreneurs.
The interview wraps up and I
realise that I’ve also slightly over-
run the allotted time. Brett doesn’t
seem to mind too much. I’m then
taken around the plush offices. It’s
all new, but still manages to retain
some character: sometimes brand
new offices can really be soulless,
but they’ve managed to bring a hu-
man touch to it. There’s even an as-
sessment centre going on, and the
man on the door was on the Teach-
First scheme and now works there.
All of the staff there genuinely
seemed very engaged and enthusi-
astic about the general ethos of the
company.

Against The Odds’ packed with
start-up tips and business advice is
