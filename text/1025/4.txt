Spring 1995
March
In time honoured style, the elections reached a
much needed conclusion; F E L I X kept looking,
however, and found more news elsewhere in an
anarchic cross-campus battleground of computer
rifling, International Night fights, vociferous fire
alarms and a misquoted Gliding Club who have
yet to be understood...

...but whose erratum is it anyway? T w o conflicting letters from
Gliding Club hit the letters pages leaving no-one any the wiser.
Meanwhile the previously sane people who had mutated into election
candidates were now fielding both flans and questions from the Mary's
Medics. The C & G elections came and went with barely a whimper,
and a 7% turnout: "less and late publicity" was one reason given. In
another suburb of Election City, Ghassan Karian was elected U L U
President, admitting that he'd occasionally tell "fibs" though
promising he'd try to be honest most of the time. Elsewhere, JapanSoc
boycotted International Night and criticised the OSC chair's handling
of the event, saying that they didn't get early enough notice. "Nobody
else had problems, nobody else has complained," the OSC chair
Andreas Mershin said as he stumbled over pride on the way to a fall.
FELIX 1024-E
Results! Election fever finally came to a head as the visitors were
announced to a crowded DaVinci's bar. Tears as well as alcohol flowed
freely as winners and losers either celebrated or drowned sorrows: in
between giving booze-soaked interviews to the assembled journos...

The morning-after-the-night-before, and the elections still refused to
leave F E L I X alone. The St Mary's Union defended the block vote,
where students seem to have been openly advised on how to choose
candidates (in stark contrast to IC where students seemed to have been
openly advised on how to avoid voting completely). A mere 17%
turned out. Against fierce background controversy, International
Night was a sell-out success - although Andreas Mershin "didn't
expect it to go so well". DoC was targeted once again by thieves, whilst
the Linstead Fire Alarms screamed at the faintest whiff of smoke. The
Warden said the "ridiculous" system was effectively "life threatening
because nobody takes it seriously anymore." In another development,
furious research staff were asked to waive rights after changes made to
their terms and conditions by college.

been given this year). T h e
elections for the new executive
will be held on the second week
of next term.

remaining tight-lipped about a

Sabbatical Elect Ejected
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies) elect, T i m Townend,
was asked to leave IC U n i o n
premises last Friday night after
being involved i n a drunken
brawl.
The second year Mechanical
Engineering student was
reportedly throwing a rugby ball
around the Union foyer when he
hit a fellow punter i n the face,
reacting aggressively to efforts to
calm him. As F E L I X went to
press, it was not clear whether
Union disciplinary action would
be taken.
Elec Eng in Storm
Five students were hospitalised
on Friday afternoon when a 9 x 3
plate glass window blew onto the
front row of a first year electrical
engineering lecture theatre.

The outlook for Graduate career
opportunities is looking brighter
following the opening of a new
post w i t h i n our own college.
Imperial College is seeking an
Assistant P l a n n i n g Officer to
"strengthen its existing academic
planning team" according to an
advertisement placed i n this
weeks Times Higher Education
Supplement.
Graduates holding a good
honours degree i n a numerate
discipline should apply by
10/4/95 to M s M i c h e l l e
Hammond, Room 426 Sherfield
Building.
CVCP Urge Rethink
A report from the Committee of
Vice Chancellors and Principals
( C V C P ) published last week
questions government higher
education policy. D r Kenneth
Edwards, Chairman of C V C P ,
said that without a 'fundamental
rethink of university finance', the
present system would ultimately
damage the quality of higher
education.
The C V C P report analyses
the recent higher education
expansion against its funding
background, urging the
government to lift the current
intake-cap. A l t h o u g h the
government aim to have 33% of
school leavers going into higher
education by the end of the
century, they will not lift the cap
on intake numbers until 1998/99.
T h e amount of money
available per student has fallen by
25% since 1989. Whilst the CVCP
acknowledge that improved
efficiency has helped to deal with
the funding squeeze, they are
concerned that it has caused
academic staff wages to fall, and
has lowered investment for the
future.
