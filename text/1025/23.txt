Fencing
11-12th March 1995
This weekend saw several of the
Fencing club in action. In
Saturday's Portsmouth Open, the
men's foil squad all reached the
last 32. Alex Davies fenced par-
ticularly well, going on to his first
final place, eventually ending up
nth.
Final Imperial placings were:
29th Nick Manton
30th Jeff Won
4&th Lawrence Gould
On Sunday, Imperial sent a
team to ihe national student
novice foil competition in
Reading. They were unlucky to
draw the eventual winners m the
unusual format of the competition
were relegated to the plate compe-
tition. In the last 16 they defeated

and 5

winning both decisive matches.
This put them into the final
against R H B N C '13'. Y K , who
hadn't yet fenced his best, got it
together and won his three
matches with the loss of just one
point. This left the score at 4-4
with one left to play. In the last
fight, Ambrose jarred everyone's
nerves by letting his opponent
claw it back to 4-4, before win-
ning the competition on the very
final hit of the day.
Congratulations go to the
whole team; Y K Chan, Jamie
Harle and Ambrose Poon.

The first day was sunny and a
steady wind was blowing above

with our fluorescent sails, trying
to impress the roaring sea. But the
following day mother nature was
due to keep us at bay, allowing
only the most experienced of us to
brave its rage. Meanwhile a good
bunch of reckless swimmers had
an early February bath.
After such intense efforts, we
went back with an empty stom-

would have missed "Blind Sate".
