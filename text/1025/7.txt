apology to the people who elected
them for using their mandate in
such an undemocratic, under-

Dear Felix,
We want to apologise to both
you and Mr. Mershin for handing in
last week's 'Night of the Long
Knives' letter. As your guest editor
pointed out correctly, that letter
was a mistake. We should have
tried to settle our differences within
the OSC in the first place, instead
of dragging them out into the
public and into Felix.
Following a discussion last
Friday, everybody is reconciled and
OSC exec will hopefully be able to
work well until the end of this year.

Dear Sir or Madam,
First of all I would like to point
out that International Night '95
was a sold out success and a
tribute to the multicultural and truly
international nature of IC's
academic community. For this
event to happen, students from all
parts of the world had to work
together, in order to introduce and
educate a wide and diverse
audience to the cultures of their
home countries. It so happened
that students coming from
countries that have been in open or
concealed conflict for more time
than anyone can remember,
worked side by side proving once
more that it is the governments
that do the wars and not the
people.
The Overseas Students'
Committee was in charge of
organising the event and as it is
only natural during the
organisation of an event of such
magnitude, there were arguments,
anxiety, stress and some good
laughs as well.
Referring to the letter in last
week's FELIX: 'Night of the Long
Knives', I must point out that the
OSC exec, officers that signed the
letter have apologised for acting at
the heat of the moment and during
an OSC exec, meeting last Friday
we managed to resolve all matters
that have led to their letter. I must
admit that the stress of setting-up
the largest-student organised event
of IC got us and there was a
temporary breakdown in commun-
ication between some of us.
However, we are now back on
line with a St. Patrick's Day Disco in
the MDH (Sherfield Building) today,
organised jointly with the
Kensington Committee for
Friendship of Overseas Students
(KCFOS). entrance is £2 for OSC or
KCFOS members if bought in
advance from 14 Princes Gardens
or £3 at the door. There are prizes
to be won.
sincerely yours,
Andreas Mershin
Chairman, Overseas' Students
Committee
Imperial College Union
Dear Editor,
Last Saturday night the Hellenic
Society organised a rather unusual
event. Four bands namely Wild
Angel, Arpa Cola, Gyalia Karfia
(the Society's own band) and
Christinas Band performed live in
the ICU lounge. They gave us a
wide range of music from
"rempetika" (Greek popular music
often described as the greek blues)
to Hard Rock. We would like to
thank the musicians for
participating, the Jazz & Rock
society and Dram Soc for their kind
support and the audience for
attending. We would also like to
take this opportunity to thank the
members of the OSC and its
president Andreas Mershin for
organising the International Night.
We as the Hellenic Society
participated in all the events (food
fair and cultural show) and we
believe that it was a very nice and
well coordinated team effort. We
thus believe that the criticisms
heard after the event (see letters to
last weeks felix) are unfair for the
OSC and for the effort they put in
organising everything despite the
various problems.
Yours sincerely,
Nikos Doukas
Publicity Officer, Hellenic
Society
Harry Hatzkis
Chairman, Hellenic Society
As readers are encouraged to write
to FELIX it was good to see opinions
expressed in the last issue. This
week though as everyone seems to
be rushing to retract and rebuff any
and every critisim, I just feel that it is
a pity that nobody is prepared to
stand by their original views.
All this insistence that everything is
hunky dory in the OSC just does not
wash considering previous
comments. How can either the
chairman or executive committee
members both write and say such
damaging things about each other
and then suddenly be best of
friends? It's all too much

In Felix 1023 Marcus Alexander
suggested the abolition of the
CCUs. As active members of the
R C S U , we would like to present
the other side of the argument.
Marcus suggests that the CCUs
are an "outdated anachronism".
Perhaps we are just suckers for
history, but if they were abol-
ished, what w o u l d they be
replaced w i t h ? Faculties of
Science, Engineering and Mineral
Studies? The same idea under a
shining "new university" name?
Remove the power from the
hands of the students and present
it to the faceless administration?
There are, we suggest, three
reasons why students aren't more
involved with their C C U : (1) our
union is so good we don't have to
fight for anything; (2) the average
IC student's workload is too high
to bother once he/she is in a
special interest society; or (3)
students don't realise they can be
involved - they see their C C U as
cliquey club.
Perhaps students aren't aware
of the services provided by their
C C U . It's not just sports and
mascotry - which incidentally, is
not "sad", it's a lot of fun and a
good rag fund-raiser. The CCUs
cut IC into a less daunting size.
Even though we are an all-science
college, it would still be difficult
for I C U to provide the academic
support given by the C C U s
because of the d i v e r s i t y of
courses. CCUs enable first years
to meet friendly 2nd and 3rd
years on their course. Okay, you
do this anyway through any old
club or society, but how m u c h
time do you spend at a meeting
discussing work? How else would
you find out what lies ahead?
The eternal events problem
mentioned by Marcus is a dif-
ferent matter altogether -
attributable to lack of money
rather than lack of interest in
CCUs. If a student only spends
£15 a week on food, how can
he/she afford £45 for one night?
Generally the C C U s need an
injection of enthusiasm, and we
believe the imminent arrival of St
Mary's on the IC campus will do
this. Mary's has been a separate
college u n t i l recently, and i n
many ways still is. W i l l Mary's
fall down to the current C C U
apathy level? Somehow, if the
hustings are anything to go by, we
t h i n k not. T h e minuscule
turnout at IC hustings compared
to Mary's show that perhaps we
have an Imperial College apathy
problem rather than a C C U one.
Constituent College Unions
are fundamental to the indivi-
duality of Imperial College. We,
the authors of this articles, do not
see ourselves as "sad" and believe
we have enough personality to
stand up w i t h o u t any " s i l l y
scarves". However we are proud
to be members of I m p e r i a l
College Union and we are proud
to belong to the Royal College of
Science. " A p a t h y " is an over-
used word, but don't let it deny us
this unique privilege.
