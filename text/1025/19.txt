Two statements concerning art
and the holocaust confront you on
entering after auschwitz. The
first, "to write a poem after
Auschwitz is barbaric", may give
the exhibition a title but it also
opens the way to its main criticism.
The holocaust, as an artistic
concept, is something so powerful
that too often it is used to promote
bad art, rather than good art
being used to confront the ghosts
of the past and spirits of the
future. The other phrase is, "how
is one to speak of it? how is one
not to speak of it?". Between these
two lies an dilemma which few
artists appears to realise.
Some of the exhibits fall into
this trap. A single suitcase, with
the title 'this suitcase is aryan', has
no meaning outside of the
exhibition. Indeed the only power
it possesses is drawn from the fact
that it's in an exhibition about the
holocaust. As an artifact it says
nothing universal about the why
or how. In part this kind of failure
is inherent in the exhibition's
philosophy too. As a contemporary
exhibition, After Auschwitz only
uses art made within the last
decade. Yet the most powerful
images tend to come from those
artists like Zoran Music, who
actually endured the camps
themselves. Music's figures are
grotesque and twisted, in a way
that the younger artists' perfection
and skill seems to belittle.
Perhaps it's fitting that the
most powerful image in the
exhibition is a photograph,
considering that this was the
medium which revealed the
camps' existence to a disbelieving
world in the first place. H.
Langenheim's black and white
photographs revisit the husks of
the concentration camps as they
are now. The best print, 'entrance
to undressing room of gas
chamber and crematorium II',
shows the flooded steps leading
down underground. It's more
arresting than any pictures of
skulls or deserted shoes because
the buildings remain fixed in
geographic and historical terms.
Whereas suitcases need frightened
masses to give them meaning, the
significance of buildings of mass
destruction is held in solitude.
After Auschwitz is a strange
mix of good, worthy and trashy
but, in a strange way, reading the
visitors' book tells you more about
contemporary attitudes. Where the
old write about 'not forgetting',
one youngster put; "how much is
Spielberg getting?" 0

Yes it's mellow but thankfully
there's no doubt that this is three

Some people say that these

to agree.

Surprisingly melodic outing from
this New York punk crew. If
you've been suckered by the
likes of Green Day then this
could (and deserves) to appeal to
you.
china drum - barrier ep
Apparently, Green Day's
favourite band. Not much of a
recommendation I grant you, but
this heavily Husker Du-
influenced number succeeds
where most Bob Mould-copyists
fail miserably.
morphine - super sex
Two-string bass, saxophone,
drums and vocals; sounds like a
recipe for a bonafide disaster but
they somehow manage it.
