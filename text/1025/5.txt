Tokyo Nerve-Gassing
It's Monday afternoon and
somebody has just entered the
office with an Evening Standard
and the above Dews story. I'm
struck by it - it seems so unreal,
the plot of a James Bond film or a
cyberpunk thriller. The archaic
weapon makes the brutality even
clearer. Somebody invented thai I
gas to kill people, and seventy
years on it still does.
Despite bans on chemical
weapons we all know how to
make them. It is banal to say that
inventions cannot be' uninvented,
okay, it's also banal to talk about
starving children. But could a
poison gas never have been
invented? Could successive scien-
tists have refused to work poison
gas?
T h i s reminded me of a
theme of Prof. Joseph Weizen-
baum, of the M I T A I lab and
now an active raiser of ethical-
awareness. He asked attendants
at the 'Philosophy and Ethics of
Science' conference held here last
Saturday to consider whether the
work they were doing was
'Noontime' or 'Midnight'. He
agreed that there were grey areas
but the argument that one might
not know the results of ones work
only means that one should
abandon it. "I'm not the judge of
ethical issues," he said. "I'm only
asking you to at least consider
what you are doing."
Because at the moment it
seems that nobody does.
Death to the Easter Bunny
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I'm going to
have to squash the 'Cadbury's
cream egg' debacle before one
more person wanders into this
office saying 'How do they get
the cream' etc. The centre of the
egg is first made as a solid and
then coated i n chocolate.
Cunningly, an enzyme known as
Invertase has already been added
to the would-be-cream. T h i s
enzyme breaks down the solid
over a period time to produce the
creamy egg we eat today. The
process can take up to two
months... Santa Klaus anyone? (I
also step on ants).
So this is Easter
It's finally dawning on me that
I'll soon be out of F E L I X . It's
strange, it - of course - only
seems like yesterday that I
started. Eight issues of the thirty-
three left! Good luck to everyone
who has to face the end of their
time at IC with examinations.
Thanks to all the excellent
people who helped out with
F E L I X this term. Your con-
tinual enthusiasm never fails to
cheer and astound me. T h e
summer will be a fun one: I hope
you all stick around for the final
sundown.
