Referendum on
NUS: Next Term
A N D R E W D O R M A N - S M I T H
& L Y N N B R A V E Y
Imperial College U n i o n (ICU)
students will finally have the first
chance since 1977 to vote on
their Union's affiliation to the
National U n i o n of Students
(NUS). With 1,000 votes needed
to make the referendum valid,
voting is likely to take place
across college during the whole
of the third week of next term.
I C U C o u n c i l agreed to a
referendum at their last meeting,
despite earlier showing reti-
cence, after members described
how they gathered the necessary
200 petition signatures with
considerable ease. Whilst it was
clear that not all students
supported joining, virtually
everyone who was asked agreed
that students themselves should
decide.
Students w i l l make their
choice throughout college on the
8th and 9th M a y . Imperial
College U n i o n is expected to
widely publicise the referendum,
in an attempt to ensure the
required turnout. Ballot boxes
may even be taken to student
Halls in the evenings.
To regulate the campaig-
ning, activists have been
encouraged to form distinct
groups. Sarah Thomas, the new
C & G President, has agreed to
chair the Anti lobby, and George
Konstantinidis chair the Pro
group. Initially a spending limit
of £160 has been set for each
campaign, but there has been
speculation that the NUS and the
Conservative Party will fund the
respective activities: a move
which could cause the figure to
rise substantially.
Meanwhile, with U n i o n
Exec members and Clubs and
Societies funds being barred
from the forthcoming battle, IC's
Conservative Society have been
forced to remove part of their
World Wide Web page. Two of
their members printed highly
opinionated articles on the
"extremist and corrupt N U S " :
the vitriolic attack has now been
silenced.
Feelings were exacerbated
when the N U S failed to arrive on
time to a widely publicised
meeting on the 9th March. The
meeting was supposed to provide
a forum for discussion on ICU's
decision on whether to join the
NUS. The N U S representatives
arrived at Imperial over an hour
late, by which time most of those
who had turned up had left in
disgust.
Helen-Loiuse W i n d s o r , a
first year Chemist and ConSoc
member, said: "We sat there for
40 minutes, then they didn't
show up. Some bloke came in
and said 'something else has
come up so they're not coming'."
Imperial College Chaplain Paul Brice has proved to be a man with both
medium and a message following his first prize in an IBM creative com
competition, writes Jon Jordan. Paul entered the ambiguously titled
'Freestyle' section of IBM's 'Leonardo da Vinci Award', submitting hi
multi-media 'Virgin on the Unbelievable' show (originally written for
College carol service last year. He is pictured above receiving his trop

Paul won an IBM Thinkpad notebook computer.
Merv Adams Mourned
Merv Adams, a P h D student in
the Electrical and Electronic
Engineering Department, died
from a heart attack whilst
playing football for the Royal
School of Mines on Sunday 12th
March.
He was a seasoned Imperial
student, having started his
studies on the department's
MEng course in 1989. Following
his 2:1 degree he was sponsored
by the Science and Engineering
Research Council and Northern
Telecom to study for a PhD. His
innovative work i n commun-
ications has led his death to be
described as a great loss to the
electronics industry.
A private and conscientious
person, Merv came from Belfast
and lived this year in Clayponds.
He was planning to move into
industry, having already pre-
sented a number of papers with
his supervisor.
Eight members of his
department together with one of
his team mates attended his
funeral last Friday. There are
plans to have a Memorial Service
to him in London later this year.
