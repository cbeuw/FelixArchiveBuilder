Standby
(D invasion of an old wave
Coldly left on the substitutes' bench
whilst the British press went in
search of the scene that celebrates
bugger all, r a d i o h e a d found
solace in an enraptured American
public. Hopefully then, the bends,
(this, their second album) will see
them finally accepted here at
home.
Radiohead's Strength lies in
their ability to lead you unsus-
pectingly down a sleepy path and
then lob in a grenade - 'my iron
lung' being a stunning case in
point. In fact it was the absence of
these twists, turns and bloody sharp
edges that made their first album,
'pablo honey', such a non event.
There's no worries of that sort
here though. Thorn's dangerously
quiet falsetto is swathed in six
string barbs. There are few rhyming
couplets; these songs are twisted
stories from a suffering soul, a
continuation of the angst of their
millstone 'creep' - finally being laid
to rest. Listen to 'fake plastic trees'
and then tell me that they are a
one song band. Listen to any on,
and all of, this album.
So, this is big. To say that this
is stadium sized is an indignity (U2,
Simple Minds, James - go home,
you poor country cousins). Why
then do I fervently hope that they
remain sweat filled divers as
opposed to open air anonymous?
Maybe because to be cut like this
when claustrophobic is all the more
poignant. (9)
emf are one of those bands
known more for their antics off the
disc than on it. Appearing on the
front cover of the Daily Star, taking
ecstasy, stuffing limes under their
foreskins and so on... The elements
of the list are diverse and
interesting, if occasionally less than
impressive. And that's not a bad
way to sum up the musical
offerings on their eclectic but very
good third album, cha cha cha.
'perfect day' is the perfect
opener. With a chorus that will reel
you in and using everything from
party whistles to a big guitar solo,
this rocks in the best cliched
meaning of the phrase. But, it's the
mid-album duo of 'shining' (with
the inspired backing of a forty piece
part of the London Symphony
Orchestra) and 'bring me down'
where they really shine. Both are
epic, rock anti-ballads that build
from humble beginnings into rich,
anthemic finales.
Alas, the second half of the
album is not nearly as good as the
first half, 'bleeding you dry' is
trance-dance dirge, while a few
others are a bit too experimental
for their own good. Thankfully,
things don't end on a downer;
'glass smash jack' comes brimming
with a quickfire rap, machinery-
sounding guitars and some spoken
word verse courtesy of Stephen Fry.
If they can stem their lapses
into over-diversification then maybe
EMF will surprise us all with a
classic album. In the meantime, this
will do nicely. (8)
Facing a clear choice between
their big brassy pop sound and
further giant steps down the road
to experimentation, the b o o
radley's seem to have opted firmly
for the former, wake up boo.', their
new album, is a collection of songs-
to-be-sampled for early morning
breakfast shows. Obviously, the
title track is an anthem to anti-
insomnia: the perfect way to wake
up your room mate. But other
songs ponder slumber to the extent
that sleep seem to lie just beyond
the end of each track; a canyon
waits to swallow the light of these
songs.
That's about the only dark
edge to the album though. Martin
Carr appears to have left off the
sideline Mercury Rev listening to
concentrate soley on his Beatles
and Beach Boys collection. At times
it's almost embarrassing, with Sice
veering dangerously close to poor
Lennon impersonations as opposed
to being inspired.
In summary, it's a disap-
pointment, in that way that judging
pop music usually returns such a
verdict. Perhaps after the genius of
'giant steps' they needed a
breather - 'wake up boo!" is an
album of breathers; like fresh air
but with transparent content. (7)
Apart from being totally anti-
racist and an all round nice guy, I
knew nothing about a p a c h e
indian. Until I got bis new album,
make way for the indian, I'd only
ever heard the single ' b o o m -
shackalak'. I warn you now - if you
like that single, you'll probably hate
this album.

There are three bright
moments on the cd. 'boba' sounds
like one of my mum's south
american new age tapes - kinda
mellow and uplifting, 'born for a
purpose' starts off sounding like
'strawberry fields' and ends up as
reggae, while 'boomshackalak' is a
funky-deep-groove-sex thang.
However, the vast majority of the
other eleven tracks are typically
tuneless rap songs, which to my
untrained ears sound just like
shouting over a drum beat. (6)
Many bands are like
chameleons - they change their
musical colours to suit the
corporate surroundings. One could
accuse American metallers
mindfunk of being such a case.
After all, there are a number of
tracks on their third album, people
who fell from the sky, that are not
unlike 'dirt'-era Alice in Chains
compositions, 'seasick' is the
perfect example; its mellow, drug-
hazed vibe underpinned by a dark,
haunting streak that emanates
from sludging guitars. But to
dismiss Mindfunk in this manner
would be to do them a disservice.
Although this album is not an easy
listen, ultimately you get the feeling
that it could end up being a
rewarding one. (7)
I had no idea what mc 900 ft
jesus' new album, one step ahead
of the spider, would be like, but I'd
heard the name somewhere
before. Indie? No. Rock? No. Rap?
Jazz? Getting closer. Don't be put
off by the MC, the adjective for this
album is cool. Saxes and flutes
whirl and soar over gentle hypnotic
beats on the first, 12 minute track
new moon', creating a chilled out,
trance-like ambience.
The down side to this album is
that it tends to be similar stuff all
through, a common blight on most
contemporary music styles. This is
late night atmosphere music, an
accompaniment to other activities.
Would I buy it? Well, I might record
it. (7)
Tricky's version of massive
attack's 'karma coma', entitled
'overcome' is beautiful: a
mysterious floating melody with
barely intelligible but definitely
gorgeous lyrics laid over languid
backbeats. Unfortunately Massive
Attack choose to throw away the
melody in favour of sort rapping
and rely on the instrumental
backdrop. Of the nine remixes on
their new ep, karma coma, the
Portishead one is the nicest, with its
sparse, inspiring guitar lines, but
ultimately losing the tune was a
bad idea. (6)
