Einstein plays matchmaker in iq, a
comedy about the romance
between his niece and a mechanic.
Having the cleverest man in the
world don a pair of wings, a quiver
and a bow seems a very unlikely
story, and it is. IQ is one of the
more unusual romantic comedies
this year. Walter Matthau (Albert
Einstein) completely destroyed my
preconception of the real man.
The storyline has garage
mechanic Ed (Tim Robbins) falling
madly in love with Einstein's niece
Catherine (Meg Ryan). As with all
love stories there is always
something blocking the path of
love, and in this case it is James
(Stephen Fry) and the fact Ed does
not meet Catherine's requirement
in the intelligence stakes. However
when Ed meets Einstein and
happens to tell him of his love for
Catherine, Einstein plans to pass
him off as a genius. With one
obstacle out of the way James
becomes the next target, though
he, in turn, is out to prove that Ed is
a fraud. As you can see, IQ has to
be taken with a pinch of salt,
Matthau's make up is very
convincing and seeing the greatest
mind of all time letting his hair
down is a bit of a laugh. Tim
Robbins is more humourous
compared to his previous roles but
as usual he shows his acting
versatility. The most disappointing
performance comes from Meg
Ryan, typecast once again as the
lady looking for love. Stephen Fry
plays a very British character; ie
Stephen Fry once again plays
Stephen Fry.
IQ does not tax the mind at
all; turn up, sit down, pass out.
Some scenes are hilarious and well
set up. In particular the Princeton
backdrop adds to the atmosphere
of the film and seeing Einstein on
the back of a motor bike is a
novelty no one can miss. Not!!
just cause tells the story of a
young black man (Blair Underwood)
who claims he has been falsely
imprisoned for the rape and brutal
murder of a young white girl eight
years ago. With the help of his
grandmother he contacts Paul
Armstrong (Sean Connery), a
Harvard law professor who is
strongly opposed to the death
penalty. Armstrong eventually
agrees to see the man and so a
story unfolds in which the convicted
man claims he was kept awake and
beaten until he confessed. What's
more a religious psycho in the
same jail admitted to him that he
was the killer.
Armstrong begins to inves-
tigate and interviews the other
prison inmate who claims to be the
murderer - during which the man
quotes a verse from the bible which
leads Armstrong to the murder
weapon. This, along with a letter
which was supposedly written to
the parents of the murdered child
while the man was in prison, are
enough to secure the release of the
wrongly convicted Underwood.
Everything seems fine until
Armstrong receives phone calls
which begin to point to the fact that
he has just released a guilty man.
Underwood, now free, begins to
seek revenge on Armstrong's wife
for her part in an earlier conviction.
The plot's unoriginal up to the
point where Underwood is
released, (innocent guy imprisoned,
another prisoner claims to have
done the murder; it's a little too
Shawshank Redemptionish) but the
twist at the end make up for it, if
not leaving you slightly confused as
to who is guilty.
drop zone begins as two US
marshals, Pete Nessip (Wesley
Snipes) and his brother Terry
(Malcom-Jamal Warner), escort a
convicted computer hacker, Earl
Leedy, to a federal prison by plane.
During a mid-flight hijack there's
an on-board explosion; Pete has
his prisoner snatched and fails to
save the life of his brother.
The film moves rapidly from
one action sequence to the next,
but the acting is mostly of the
physical kind. This and the pace of
the film leave little opportunity for
character development. For
example hardly any time is devoted
to Pete's grief over the death of his
brother before he goes undercover
in the world of sky-diving to find
the people responsible. You see,
Pete believes that the people
involved in the hijack are expert
skydivers who managed to make
their escape by parachute.
Because of the sky-diving
scenes, Drop Zone will undoubtedly
be much compared with Point
Break. Nevertheless, the sky-diving
scenes are still exhilarating to
watch and are perhaps the closest
you'll ever get to experiencing the
thrill of the sport without having to
carry out the jumps yourself. One
can't help but smile at Pete's initial
skydiving attempts and at the
petrified Earl Leedy repeatedly
being forced to skydive as a means
of getting him to cooperate with his
kidnappers.
Following his previous roles in
such films as Passenger 57 and
Demolition Man, Wesley Snipes is
surely emerging as an action hero
who is comparable to Stallone and
Schwazenegger. Indeed, he plays
the part of Pete Nessip with great
aptitude.
There's no denying it, Drop
Zone is a no-nonsense, no-brains-
required action flick; if action is
what you desire, I can guarantee
that it will not disappoint. 0
