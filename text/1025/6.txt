Incoming
Head of Security Responds... Marcus/Frater...Understandable ?
OSC try a change of heart! A Failed Candidate Comes Clean...
Fire !
Response to Article "Fire Alarms
Linstead" Felix 10 March 1995.
The College is morally and
legally committed to ensuring the
safest possible fire precautions for
students and staff alike.
The standard of fire precautions
is dictated by legislation and
College premises are regularly
inspected by the relevant
Authorities.
The standard, sensitivity and
sophistication of equipment used is
dictated by the relevant British
Standards.
The College is very much aware
that the living style of students is
different from those members of
the public who normally reside in
House of Multiple Occupation and
Hotels. Every effort is being made
to ensure as little disruption as
possible and frequent meetings are
held with the relevant Authorities
regarding specific problems.
Life saving equipment is not
installed unnecessarily, and the
type and standard of equipment is
directly related to the risk factor
and legislative requirements.
There has to be a reason for an
alarm activation, it is either a
malicious false alarm, or a
genuine incident has activated the
system. The great majority of
alarms to date have been caused
as a direct result of cooking
facilities, burning candles, joss
sticks, and persons removing
detectors. Although these incidents
are a nuisance to occupants, they
are caused by occupants, they are
genuine activations and the fire
alarm system is performing the
function for which it is designed.
It is of interest to note, that
during the periods when Resi-
dences are let to the public, fire
alarm activations are virtually zero.
The College is making every
effort to ensure the safety of
students and staff in all
environments, and the Fire Section
of the Security Department seeks
your assistance in this continuing
commitment.
All suggestions and comments
will be discussed and given
consideration, however, College
has no option but to work within
the frame work of the relevant
legislation.
Please remember fire, smoke
and fumes can and do kill. Smoke
and fume inhalation accounts for
the greatest proportion of fire
related deaths each year.
Upgraded systems are being
installed to protect you. This type
of full protection is new but

essential in Halls of Residence, we
all have to accept a period of

Keith Reynolds
Fire/Security Manager.
Wh//e no one doubts your
commitment to safety, what is the
point of highlighting the lack of
alarms during public lettings if you
say that you recognise that student
occupancy is different? How can a
system that has been activated due
to ordinary cooking or because of
showers be suitable for student
halls? Using legislation to defend
the changes is one thing, but is the
prime objective of the new system
the protection of students or the
legal provision for the Accomm-
odation Office to operate halls as
hotels during student vacations ?

Dear Felix,
Simon Baker, it seems, is doing
himself a great disservice. In last
week's issue he claimed to be
unable to understand what, or my
associate, were talking about; and
yet his letter betrays the fact that
he has a great understanding of
our writings. He seems to know at
least as much as I do about Yves
Klein, and he is able to discuss the
workings of Frater Fiam's articles
with a high level of erudition. So
why does he want to claim that I
and the Frater are incompre-
hensible and meaningless? One
can only assume that he is
suffering from peer pressure, that
his less than intelligent friends
have spent the last year
haranguing him about his love of
intelligentsia. Thus, in a feeble
attempt to gain some street-cred,
Mr Baker has written this bizarre
letter in which he firstly claims that
Frater Fiam writes "purple prose
which says absolutely nothing"
then continues by explaining how
he disagreed with the topic of the
Frater's previous column. Surely if
Mr Baker really found the Frater's
articles meaningless, then he could
not argue about the topics
contained within them?
More importantly however,
there are a few inaccuracies that I
must rectify. Mr Baker's claim that I
am the Frater is unfounded and
blatantly untrue. I am no more the
Frater than Kurtz is Conrad, and
his writings are not my
responsibility. On his behalf
however, I must point out he never
talked of the common cold as
"some kind of pleasure inducing
drug". He merely stated that they
provide "mental influence" which
"can sometimes be useful.". And
on another point, neither I nor my
good and esteemed Frater are
inclined to use Roget's Mega, or
any other thesaurus, for we have
no need of them.
I am well aware that the
Frater's work is seen by the lazy
and naive as "utter drivel";
however, anyone who actually
bothered to read them carefully
would discover that each one
contains a wealth of information.
Admittedly, much of it is hidden or
described obtusely, but it is not
beyond the means of the average
degree student to see through such
disguises. So if Mr Baker spent his
time actually reading the Frater's
columns rather than providing us
with his poorly constructed
witticisms, then he might just find
that it is his life, and not just Felix,
which is much improved this year.
Yours, Marcus Alexander
/ cannot discuss Frater's incompre-
hensibility, as my claim to fame is
never having read past the first
paragraph of any of his epics, but
then maybe I am 'lazy and naive'.
Marcus though can be quite
interesting, when understandable.

Dear Owain,
As I haven't been elected, I had
better come clean about my real
policies :-
taxing of lectures in order to
subsidize beer. Pay as you learn I
use library resources as an
extra form of heating in the union
bar.
banning of the word "sex" in
college unless a demonstration
accompanies.
1/3 of male population should
have a sex change, in order to
keep numbers even.
pillows, blankets, and carpet
slippers to be supplied to all
lecture theatres.
mortgage off the Sherfield
Building in order to buy a brewery.
lobby parliament to introduce
sheep onto Hyde Park.
This is in response into Marcus
Alexander's article saying that no
presidential candidates have any
policies. I abject to the St. Mary's
idea that they can rule ICU. But I
support Sarah White in her victory.

OSC Fight ?
Dear Felix,
As overseas students at Imperial
we wish hereby to thank Messrs.
Sinner, Dua and Samarasingle for
their highly informative and
illuminating letter in Felix 1024
('Night of the long knives').
Were it not for this letter, we
would never have found out that
three members of the exec, of our
Committee consider that the exec.
Chairman has a 'distinctly
disorganised way of handling
affairs' and a 'lack of
communication', and makes public
statements they claim are 'not
true'. We would never have found
out that they have been forming
this opinion 'throughout the year'.
And we would never have found
out that, while they thought that
'this disorganisation became even
more obvious during the last week
of preparations for International
Night', they failed for reasons
undisclosed to tender their
resignations at that time with effect
after the end of International
Night. This would have given
them the opportunity to separate
their responsibilities while still
making their services available to
the exec, for the organisation of
International Night, and was the
only decent course of action their
stated opinion would have allowed
them if discharging their duty to
the people who elected them was
their priority.
Were is not for this letter, we
would have been unaware that we
had elected to the exec, of our
Committee persons so totally
unconcerned with the status of that
exec, as the representative body of
Imperial overseas students that
they would sign a letter alleging
that its competence was comprom-
ised by a Chairman they consider
lacking in the necessary skills, IN
THEIR CAPACITIES AS ELECTED
MEMBERS OF THAT EXEC!
Thus we would never have
found out that at least three of the
people elected to represent
Imperial overseas students seem to
assume that the OSC exec, is an
oligarchy entitled to use the
capacities of the posts they have
been democratically elected to in
backstage machinations, and that
the people they represent and are
accountable to are either morons
or so apathetic it makes no
difference.
But who knows? They may be
right, after all. If this Wednesday's
Chairman's meeting of the OSC
doesn't face these gentlemen with
the logical consequences of their
