THE ARTS CATALYST AND SUPERNOVA
A LECTURE TO REMEMBER
LOCAL HIGHLIGHTS OF SET95
"I saw some of those science week programmes advertised on the BBC,"
the security guard for my building told me. "I thought you'd be
interested. O f course that means it's time for the rest of us to put on a
video".
Science Week, called set9S (following on with impeccable logic from
last year's set! ), is here again. Hundreds of events, thousands of people...
and something a bit different from The Arts Catalyst. Set up by two ex-Imperial students
Nicola Triscott (Physics) and Vivienne Glance (Life Sciences), The lifts Catalyst is
bringing scientists and artists together in a season of events under the title Supernova.
Projects include a dance production Talking the Sex of Angels and a spoof lecture,
Professor A. A. Singleton Guinness (win tickets below). In this month's Physics World,
Vivienne asks: "If the benefits of science are so obvious, why are fewer students
choosing to study it, and why are the E U and U K govenments promoting weeks to its
understanding?" She highlights as one explanation the often cliched portrayals of
scientists by the media. "Image is one problem, and artists and writers have tended to
hinder rather than help, often representing the fears of science in reworkings of the
Frankenstein story."
In an effort to overcome this image, The Rrts Catalyst have commissioned a dance
presentation called Talking the Sex of Angels as part of set9B. The show is inspired by
the language and concepts of quantum
physics, and scientific input came from
members of Imperial's theoretical
physics group.
So don't put on a video tonight, try
Talking the Sex of Angels instead. Or
you can win free tickets to a "lecture"
by fictional comedy character Professor
A. A. Singleton Guinness. It takes
place i n the Pippard lecture theatre a
week on Sunday.
They probably won't help you pass
your degree i n a practical sense. But
they might rekindle your interest -
which in the long run could be much
more valuable.
