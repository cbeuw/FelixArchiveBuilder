Thought for the day
No. 7: The fall and rise of Felix
I
f there is such a thing as a reg-
ular reader of my self-indulgent
musings (Ali Campbell? Isn't he
the bloke who was in UB40?) then
he or she will undoubtedly be
rather miffed about the lack of any
contribution in last week's Felix. 1
secretly suspect that our beloved
Editor loathed my curry article too
(it was supposed to be about the
elections, all right?) but apparently
he just ran out of space. (Perhaps
Simon Baker had been having
words...) Naturally he then had to
bribe me not to reveal the incident
involving the evil malfunctioning
printing press, the spade and the
three thousand pound repair
invoice, which, it must be said, he
has kept under a real shroud of
secrecy. (At least, nobody has
mentioned it to Andy Heeps yet).
My point, which is rapidly van-
ishing into the lofty green mists of
time, is that, at least as far as I am
concerned, Felix has turned the
corner. The reason that Jeremy had
no room for my shite last week is
that the contributions are now
coming thick and fast. Jon does not
wander round the office, pale-
faced, wondering where his next
feature is coming from. (I'm sure
he illegally wrote a lot of them him-
self, you know.) News meetings no
longer consist of two people
standing around a depressingly
white whiteboard arguing about
whose turn it is to make the tea,
and deciding whether the article
about the broken toilet in
Chemistry should go on the front
page or not. Last week there were
more music reviewers than records
to review. We once again have a
full complement of sub-editors.
Plus I have not been forced to
proof read anything for weeks now,
so some unfortunate sucker must
have been found to do that as well.
Jeremy is doing more editing and
less of everything else, the collating
is now done by Inky and his team,
rather than myself and the Editor
on Thursday nights until three in
the morning (Rock and roll!), the
music pages have picked up; it's all
going rather nicely. Oh, and
Liverpool beat Arsenal at the week-
end, so the God of the Print Shop,
Andy "Inky" Thompson, is the only
miserable bugger in the office.
I ought to say at this point that
Felix appreciates all contributions,
and that if you are interested, just
pop in. I'm not going to, though,
because some scoundrel, who can
write infinitely better than I, might
steal my precious hallowed column
inches. Ali Campbell
