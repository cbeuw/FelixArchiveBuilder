There's more at stake than the
BUSA entry at this Tuesday's coun-
cil. It is the first real test of whether
medical students can get what they
want from ICU on its own terms.
There's no question this time of
any kind of block voting or subver-
sive tactics; the vote will ultimately
be decided by council members,
many of whom are medical stu-
dents who got their positions fair
and square at the beginning of the
year.
The result will be even more
decisive because the conflicting
motions both have a iot of weight
behind them - one written by the
president of ICSM and the other by
the ex-president of ICU. Ultimately,
though, it is the motion that is
tabled first that stands the most
chance of success, as a decision on
the first motion renders the second
obsolete. As it stands, Katie
Armstrong has got her proposal
submitted well ahead of Eric Allsop,
so unless Eric can employ some
arcane procedure to rearrange the
order, a moral victory has already
been won by the medics.

The downside of these more
esoteric victories is the loss of
focus on the real issue; what hap-
pens to the sports clubs. Should a
double entry be approved, some
clubs would be forced to split their
teams, which could dramatically
affect their performance. So what?
Well, I certainly have a lot of sym-
pathy for the unfortunate who has
to explain to the Rector why his
beloved boat club is suddenly left
nowhere in the league.
In the end, it is the medical
clubs that have the most to gain if
they win - and I rather hope they
do.
Felix, with its keen sense of
smell, has detected a faint whiff of
dissent drifting over from Suite
five. Certain new puppies seem to
be suggesting a de-clawing for the
honourable cat. I might take the
chance to remind them that the old
moggy may react very badly to
cages and visits to the vet. You
don't survive as a street cat for 48
years without learning a trick or
two.
