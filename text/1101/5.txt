A G A I N
Dear Jeremy,
I do not wish to be one of
those people who writes in every
week just fot the sake of it.
However I feel that the comments
that Simon Baker made in this
weeks Felix are offensive and as
there is no way that people he
insults can reply without going
through you an uncomfortable sit-
uation arises. For the record
Charing Cross had the best finals
results in London and was ranked
one of the top medical schools in
the country before the merger. This
is exactly why College wanted us to
be part of Imperial in the first
place.
To say that Charing Cross
medics are unsophisticated and
need raising to the South
Kensington academic standard
prooves that he has not made any
effort to get to know anyone at
either of the medical schools and is
just writing rubbish as he grinds his
own peculiar and very personal
axe.
What his motivation for these
articles is 1 do not know. I have no
objection to having anything said
about me provided that some of
what is said is true.
If Simon wants to come over to
Charing Cross some time he would
be very welcome and then, after
that, if he still feels the same way
then he is at least writing from a
position of knowledge instaed of
the position of ignorance that he
currently occupies.
Yours sincerely,
Nick Newton, ICSM
SORRY NOT.
Dear Lads
1 am writing to apologise for
the appalling play and total lack of
professionalism that I demonstrat-
ed last Wednesday. In particular
the series of events leading up to
the third and decisive goal at the
end of the second half. 1 realise
that such poor judgement and skil-
lessness has no place in the third
team and 1 can make no excuses. I
can only hope that you can all find
it in your hearts to forgive me.
Sadly, the Dean heard about
the event and explained that, as
the college has no room for ama-
teurs, 1 have been expelled. The
Home Office has infomed me that
they are considering deportation
pending a "substantial and imme-
diate increase in skill", my parents
refuse to talk to me and unfortu-
nately, the UN has since revoked
my human rights.
Maybe there is some justice in
the world after all.
Yours Faithfully,
Steve Cram
USS ENTERPRISE
Dear Felix,
I was sorry to read in issue
1098 that your regular columnist
Simon Baker does not have much
time for ethical investments. That
is his business but 1 would like to
correct him on a factual error. The
USS pension scheme is guarenteed
in the sense that the pension
recieves is a fixed proportion of
salary on retirement, not simply a
guarenteed minimum.
Yours, Tom Hay
PROJECTILE
M O T I O N ?
Dear Felix,
I have recently heard (through
an unofficial channel) that a certain
lecturer in a certain department is
having trouble disciplining his first-
year lecturees, to the extent that
they have started throwing missiles
ar him.
You would think that those at
university might have grown up
sufficiently to avoid this sort of
childish behaviour. Having seen the
same sort of thing at school, 1
know how disheartening it would
be for the individual in question.
In addition to this, those who
wish to gain something positive
from the lectures are unable to do
so. 1 think that some penal system
should exist whereby these jokers
might be punished.
Yours faithfully

FAGS
around me suffer by allowing them
to inhale my smoke. The Junior
Common Room is a non-smoking
area in the college and there are
plenty of signs that say this.
However, as stupid as smokers
are, they seem not be able to read
nor understand these simple sym-
bolic messages. I would like to
remind smokers that the only way
they can light up in the JCR is if
someone douses them with petrol
and sets them on fire.
S Basith, l.S.E Year 4
Dear Felix,
As a non-smoker I enjoy the
benefits of living longer, not having
yellow teeth and nails, not suffering
from bad breath and reduced
chance of lung cancer and heart
disease. I also do not make others

WRITES...
Hellooo!
It's about bloody time there's
club reviews in Felix I thought 1 was
going to pass out from waiting
soooo long but all this under-
ground stuff!
What about commercial, com-
mercial, COMMERCIAL? What
about normal clubs like you get
back home (you know £5 to get in,
get pissed out of your face and pull
some gorgeous bloke - well with a
face like mine, who wouldn't - ha
ha ha).
Whatabout cheesy chart? Like
everybody... yeah yeah... rock your
body... (I can just hear the music as
I write ha ha and who you are...
what you did... I don't care... as
long as you love me... and let's go
around again... [many more exam-
ples followed - Ed]
Don't get me wrong - me and
my mate love clubbing too (Cream
- Amnesia, Privilege, Es Paradis...
yes we've been there) but
ALRIGHT! We already know about
the superclubs and the different
