JCB Causes Power "Chaos
ANDREW OFORI
After the devastating power surge
of 16 November, the hapless
Chemistry department has once
again been afflicted with electri-
cal problems. Before 9am on
Monday the RCS1 building was
suddenly cloaked in darkness.
The cause was soon traced to
sub-contractors on the BMS
building site who had still failed
to notice the fact they had grazed
the electric mains feed to RCS1.
The company responsible for
the BMS building venture, Schal,
had informed the sub-contractors
of the presence of power lines in
the area they were excavating and
advised them to dig to a safe level
using the JCB digger and then finish
the task by hand, as is common
building practice. Unfortunately the
sub-contractors attempted to com-
plete the excavation using just the
JCB and consequently struck a
power line. As news of the 'black-
out' spread to the building site and
the cause was established, the JCB
driver and his guide were dismissed
off site and replaced.
Chris Sousman, the building
supervisor from the Chemistry
department, described the situa-
tion that ensued in RCS1 as
"chaos". Due to the lack of electri-
cal equipment to control experi-
ments as well as the loss of light-
ing, the building was evacuated and
sealed. Morning lectures for the
chemists were moved to the Civil
Engineering building. The major
damage caused as a result of the
incident extended to: disruptions
to timetables, ruined experiments,
degraded or destroyed samples
and lost computer data.
London Electricity Board had
repaired the damage by 4pm on
Monday. Ian Cillett, IC'S Safety
Officer, carried out a full safety
inspection before the power was
eventually switched back on at
8.30am on Tuesday. He stated that
disruption to the department had
been kept to a minimum, but
added he was unable to assess
how severely safety levels were
compromised until the incident's
full effects had been evaluated. Illustration: Stavros Polyviou
Labour MP Talks Conservative MP Talks
PATRICK HAYES
On Tuesday 2nd December,
Imperial College Labour Club
played host to Tony Wright, MP
for Cannock Chase, and chair of
the Constitutional Affairs Select
Committee.
He spoke of "the dramatic
change which the Labour Party has
undergone in recent years, with the
party bouncing back from the elec-
tion defeat of 1992". He also
referred to a new, third way in pol-
itics, often called the "Radical
Centre", speaking of the decline of
the 1980s market doctrine and
Thatcherism, and the waning of a
public belief in the old left's idea
that "a bigger state is a better
state" describing this as "not sus-
tainable." He concluded saying
Labour must use its huge majority
to drive the country through this
period of "radical uncertainty"
ahead of the millennium.
He then faced stiff questioning
from the audience on a range of
topics including the issue of bene-
fits for single mothers. On this
point he reinforced the govern-
ment's determination to end the
"dependency culture," adding that
additional money had been made
available by Gordon Brown to help
lone parents into work. Mr Wright's
last point was that New Labour was
built on Old Labour values but with
coherent positions which people
could understand.

Imperial Students Fall Victim to Conmen
FELIX NEWS TEAM
Felix has learned that profession-
al confidence tricksters operating
around London are targeting for-
eign students at train and bus
stations. At least three IC stu-
dents have been ripped off this
term, and have lost up to £100
each.
The men are adopting a cun-
ning guise, posing as professionals
claiming to have been mugged and
needing a loan.
One of the victims was
approached whilst walking in Earl's
Court on the evening of Monday
17th November. The victim
described the incident as follows:
"I was stopped by an upper
middle class looking, tall, slim
white man wearing a grey suit and
aged between thirty-five and forty.
He asked me the way to Edgware
Road to get to the M l . Looking
very tired, he informed me that he
had been mugged in Heathrow by
two black youths and he had
reported it to the police and that he
had been walking since 8pm. He
said that they took his money, his
ticket and bag so now he was going
to hitchhike from the M I . He said
he was a professional golfer and
played for Scotland and teaches
golf in London and usually flies
from London to Edinburgh. He told
me that he was a devout Christian
and would return the money in two
days' time on Wednesday"
Convinced by the man's story
and appearance the victim gave the
man £100. In return he was given
an address and telephone number
which later proved to be false.
"I reported it to the police and
they informed me that this kind of
thing was common in London. I
could not believe my stupidity at
being conned like this but on talk-
ing to other peope I realised that
this also happened to many other
people when they initially came to
London."
The man was described as
"smartly dressed wearing a grey
trousers, black shoes, a grey blazer
and a pink shirt. He had brownish
hair with a parting from the side.
The hair was 1.5 inches long, he
was not bald. He did not carry a
bag or anything else and had a
Scottish accent."
