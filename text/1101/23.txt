IN THE PLAYHOUSES
ARTS
THE JEWISH WIFE and THE JEWISH DAUGHTER
Bertolt Brecht and Sonja Linden

T
he New End Theatre, New
End, Hampstead is a very
small, intimate venue, with
seventy-five seats, and a space at
the front, as opposed to a stage,
where all the action takes place.
This increased the impact that the
plays had on me, and 1 have a feel-
ing that both would possibly be less
effective in a larger venue. The first
play, The Jewish Wife, opens with a
woman, Judith, telephoning her
friends, cancelling bridge engage-
ments, telling them that she's
going away for a few weeks, and
asking them to look after her hus-
band, Fritz. She then rehearses the
things she wants to tell him, the
reason for her leaving, that she's
only leaving for his sake. He is, of
course, German, and the play is set
in 1937, when already the Jews
were beginning to feel the hatred of
the Nazis. The husband tries to
persuade her not to leave, but they
both know that she will, that it's the
best thing. She, however, cannot
tell him what she is really thinking
and feeling. The play ends with him
taking her to the station to catch
her train. As the one play ends the
second begins. In this companion
piece, the actress and actor playing
the wife and husband turn out to
be married, and the actress,
Amanda, is the granddaughter of
Judith. Her mother, Ruth, is in the
audience, and she enters into the
drama, as Amanda reveals that she
is preparing to leave her husband
Peter. Ruth tries to persuade her
not to, and many powerful emo-
tions are displayed.
To begin with, there is the sup-
posed anti-Semitism of Peter,
which Amanda is using as an
excuse to leave him. The play
moves on, examining both Ruth's
relationship with Judith, and
Amanda's relationship with Ruth.
Both women have a lack of a
father-figure in their lives, which
leads to them being unable to form
good, lasting relationships with
men. The argument rages on, with
all three hitting and hurting each
other, in an almost childish way.
The play ends with Peter and
Amanda resolving to talk to each
other, a complete contrast to
Judith and Fritz, who, although they
love each other, cannot talk to
each other anymore:
These plays are primarily about
lack of communication, and about
the way that people tend to think
and rehearse things they want to
say to each other, yet never man-
age to speak to each other, or
when they do actually speak, say
nothing. The first play is a political
statement.
Brecht, forced into exile, wrote
a series of plays called "Fear and
Misery in the Third Reich" which
obviously couldn't be performed in
Germany. Brecht himself was num-
ber five on Hitler's death list. These
series of plays were a definite
attempt on Brecht's part to try and
force people to understand what
was really happening in Germany,
and where the madness would lead
them to. The Jewish Wife is a very
clear picture of the devastating
impact that the Nazis had on peo-
ple's lives. The second play is also
emotionally charged; set in the pre-
sent day, it shows how little things
have changed, and how events
from our past can influence the
way we live today. This play
explored many themes, including
the after-effects of the war, the
relationship between men and
women, the relationship between
mothers and daughters and the
jealousy felt by mothers as their
daughters become sexually active. I
really enjoyed these plays, they're
thoughtful, they're thought-provok-
ing, they're tense and they're inter-
esting. They are only showing on
Sunday and Monday nights until
the 15th of December, and are well
worth a visit. The tickets will cost
you seven pounds, and the nearest
tube is Hampstead. There's also a
very good pub just next door.

27 - A PERSONAL RETROSPECTIVE
John Keats
T
his play deals with the frag-
mented memories of a 27
year old man; a personal ret-
rospective. It's from his point of
view so you could be forgiven for
expecting a boy's own adventure,
but in reality it is written by a man
rather than for a man. Whichever, it
is an insight and it touched me;
resulting in a delayed response, it
triggered a backwash of memory
ripples that I haven't had since God
knows when.
The Fecund Theatre use (rather
than abuse) their chosen tools
which comprise of radio-micro-
phones, video, cool music, narra-
tion, action, movement, sugges-
tion, and seamless integration. The
multi-media dimension doesn't
detract, it abstracts compliments
and provides depth and colour to
the passion, conscience and
humour of the performers.
The piece itself is well-balanced
and accomplished, it is not so
much a rites of passage production
as a montage of feelings and deal-
ings that make the man or perhaps
un-make the boy. An ordinary, set-
tled childhood dappled with
humour and loss begins to unravel
when Paul - the focus of our atten-
tion learns - betrayal at first hand.
At the time it is the ultimate
teenage nightmare. The girl he
loves, his first love and the receiver
of his virginity is found in bed with
his best mate. Oh dear. Paul is not
happy and the seed is sown. A piv-
otal point has been reached; until
now young teen Paul was as high
as he could go on his playground
swing without it going loop-the-
loop, experiencing the exhilaration
of weightlessness that is childhood
at the full extent of its swing. He
may well have regained control if it
hadn't been for his Uncle Dick
'beering' in with the "treat 'em
mean keep em keen" adage.
Up to this point the profession-
al cast had charmed us, with magi-
cal memories; Saturday grand-
stand, rainy Sunday boredom, the
nightmare childcatcher from 'Chitty
chitty bang bang' and 'Jaws'. All
well observed and tightly per-
formed. Now we see a change of
focus, the camera begins to swing
around and we begin to see a
decline, the degradation of a
wholesome boy to half a man.
Teenage parties, student arro-
gance and debauchery blag and
bluster their way to the very sub-
urbs of Babylon - fully fledged
'aving it, cash splash nose-powder
land. These club-drug drug-clubbed
punter stunt scenes looked and
sounded fantastic, but lacked the
sharp focus of the first half. Excess
upon excess left protagonist Paul a
hollow character, not even mildly
attractive to the audience. His
eventual awakening in the entrails
of his own hung-drawn and quar-
tered existence, was well due.
He ended the performance
with a grin, which might have pro-
voked the untempered amongst us
to loosen a couple of his teeth.
However, the audience showed no
signs of violence; they just clapped
and whooped (in an English sort of
way) because it was an excellent
show. I thought that that would be
that, ninety minutes of intelligent
and kicking entertainment but not
too much to think about. However,
within twenty-four hours I was
thinking of memories, friends,
experiences; a personal retrospec-
tive. Fecund seem to be searching
for the ultimate definition of exis-
tence; strangely epitomised in the
Schrodinger's girlfriend scene
where teenage Paul puts his love
on the line, presenting the ques-
tion(aire) 'Will you go out with me.
YES [] or NO []. An ultimate if ever
I saw one.
