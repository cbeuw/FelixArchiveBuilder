TURNER PRIZE EXHIBITION
Tate Gallery
T
he Turner Prize is (according
to my sources) awarded each
year to a British artist under
the age of fifty (blatant ageism?) for
an outstanding exhibition or other
presentation of their work in the
twelve months preceding the 31
May of that year. Last years winner
was Damien Hirst with his famous
cow in formaldehyde and I was
curious to see what this years
entrants could offer. So with the
aim of delaying my biochemistry
work for as long as possible, I set
off for the Tate with my friend Lizzy
in tow. This year the shortlisted
candidates are all women which
has brought a few accusations of
overt political correctness on the
judges' behalf after last years all
male shortlist brought accusations
of sexism. It seems as if they can't
win either way. The first exhibition
was that of Christine Borland
whose "exploration of language of
forensic science and themes of
mortality, explore the ways in
which institutions exploit and
devalue life"...mmm. Her exhibits
included two skeletal images
reflected onto the wall after being
drawn in glittery dust on panes of
glass. (I could even identify the
femur!) One of the skeletons was
very small and the other very tall,
the exhibit inspired by a book of
fairy tales. The book is on display
too so even the non-arty types like
myself can pretend we know what
it is all about.
Sasha and Mum was a black
and white
video piece by
G i l l i a n
Wearing, the
second of the
four shortlist-
ed candi-
dates. It
seemed to
consist of a
grown woman
t h r a s h i n g
about in her
u n d e r w e a r
whilst making
lots of weird
grunting nois-
es and pulling
a blanket over
her head with
another older
woman next
to her (presumeably the mum) hug-
ging her then pulling her hair about
and pushing her to the floor. I
won't pretend to know what all this
was about but as the most disturb-
ing exhibit, it will probably win.
Cornelia Parker had numerous
smaller exhibits on show including
"Wedding ring drawing" which was
in fact a series of diamond
scratched lines on the outside of a
glass display case. I was on the
verge of complaining about the
dust in the
display case
when I
realised that
the two furry
balls of fluff
were part of
the exhibition
entitled "The
Negative of
Sound". They
were earplugs
made from
dust collected
at the
W h i s p e r i n g
Gallery of St
P a u I s
C a t h e d r a l .
Inhaled Cliffs
looked sus-
piciously like a
folded sheet but 1 was assured that
the sheet had been starched with
chalk from the white cliffs of Dover
which defined it as artwork.
Leading into the next room we
were greeted by the sight of a
Clockwise from top left: Angela
Bulloch, Christine Borland, Cornelia
Parker, Gillian Wearing,
rather comfy looking, brightly
coloured beanbag/sofa object
which you could actually sit down
on. The piece called "Untitled"
(seems like she wasn't too sure
what it was either) was by Angela
Bulloch and was described as a
superstructure with satellites.
Electrical impulses triggered by
people sitting on the flat cushions
produced sounds around the
room. Her "Blip Drawing Machine"
drew a series of lines as you
watched, producing an image that
looked uncannily like an ECG,
although we decided that the
patient would almost certainly be
dead after two blipless lines were
drawn.
The Turner Exhibition is open
every day at the Tate Gallery until
18 January. The winner will be
decided on 2 December when you
can catch live coverage of the exhi-
bition on C4. You can also check
out the exhibition details on the
web at www.channel4.com. Entry
to the Tate is free but this special
exhibition costs £3.50. Love it or
hate it, it is definitely worth making
the effort to see. Decide for your-
self where modern British art
stands at the moment.

LONG LONG AGO

do we come
\ i \ l from?", "Why are we
V V here?" - questions
which have intrigued and baffled
the human race since the beginning
of time. For several years director
llan Reichel has been fascinated by
the idea of exploring the human
perception of the creation of the
world and its connection with
human creativity. Reichel began by
researching countless creation
myths and stories from throughout
the world, struck by the challenge
of lifting these legends off the page
and bringing them to life as a piece
of theatre. A little over two months
ago, Reichel, along with a cast
drawn from the Court Theatre
Training Company, began the
process of discussions, workshops
and improvisations which culminat-
ed in the production of "Long,
Long, Long Ago "
On entering the small, cosy
theatre, with its simple, bare acting
space, devoid of set but for the
wide steps rising to the backdrop,
there is an immediate sense of
expectation, of wonders about to
come to pass. At the sound of a
gong we are plunged into darkness,
and the stage is suddenly peopled
by barely visible watchers and lis-
teners. Only one man speaks,
holding aloft a single torch, of the
creation of the Sun, the Earth and
the Solar System.
Then follows a presentation of
the Polynesian creation chant,
Kumolipo, which describes the
transformation of the earth from a
dark world of water and silence
into one teeming with life of all
kinds. This involves the entire cast
chanting in unison, and bringing to
the chant the most wonderful
physical portrayals of creation and
birth. During descriptions of the
forming of the creatures in the
"pregnant night" a mass of inert
bodies becomes a crawling,
writhing tumult of emergent life,
when the cast move almost as one
single entity.
The dreaming people, a
Malaysian story, begins with a uni-
verse inhabited only by two wise
beings, at the time when the sun is
created by the giant dung beetle,
(this very cleverly played by three
actors assuming some of the
strangest postions.) The woman,
perhaps more a goddess, dreams
of the birth of a son, and begs her
husband for the child. He spreads
a cloth beneath a fruit bearing tree,
and the fruit which he catches is
transformed into the wished-for
child. The fruit is played by actors,
whose metamorphosis into human
form is perfectly in keeping with
the beautifully fluid physical work
throughout the tale, which was
flawlessly interwoven with the nar-
rative.
As the play progresses, a sense
of magic gradually develops, per-
meating both movement and
speech, completely enthralling, and
giving the feeling that one could
step in and become part of the sto-
ries being told. The final piece, "The
Land of the Gods Floats on the
Sea," tells of the time before the
islands of Indonesia were formed,
when only the home of the gods
floated upon the water. The peo-
ple of Indonesia attempt to paddle
toward this promised land, but it is
forever sinking below the horizon,
"at the point of sunrise." Here
comes a wonderful portrayal of the
travel by boat; paddles in slow,
fluid motion, somehow creating a
feeling of immense space, of infi-
nite blue. As the play ends I am
left with the sense that, having
been taken on a long journey
through the ages and through the
human consciousness, I have
arrived in a safe and peaceful
place.
