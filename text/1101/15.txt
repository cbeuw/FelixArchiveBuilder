TANYA DONELLY
University of London Union (ULU)
T
anya was formerly front-
woman of Belly, one of the
more outstanding bands to
emerge from the other side of the
Atlantic in the aftermath of the
grunge explosion of the early '90s.
She was also the main songwriter
and brought us gems such as
Cepetto and Feed the Tree.
(Disappointingly for this reviewer
she didn't play them).
Got to the venue and initially
trouble was brewing when we got
to the door. There was a problem
with the tickets, they weren't there
(as if 1 wasn't expecting this any-
way), but another flick through the
envelopes revealed the pair. We
were in, it was packed, and just in
time for the last part of the support
band The Warm Jets' set. Their
song Hurricane deserves a men-
tion just because of its utter sub-
limeness and forced restraint as
though trying to hold back, to pre-
vent from going totally ballistic.
Tanya and co. arrived a little
late to an impressively enthusiastic
crowd. A slowie from the recent
album Lovesongs For Underdogs
lulled everyone into a dreamy
sense of contentment, her voice is
exquisitely penetrating. She exud-
ed a much greater commanding
presence (compared to her Belly
days) and proves that total heavy
grunge, coated with a generous
helping of pop is not out of the
question, with blinding tracks like
Bright Light and Pretty Deep. On
the first single from the album,
Bum, her voice is impossibly per-
fect. Accusations of playing nice,
sweet, bland pop can be dismissed
immediately.
For the encore Tanya returned
alone and treated everyone to
another potent dose of her
refreshing voice.
For those fans who were raring
to hear a few old Belly numbers,
they were not let down or forgot-
ten by Tanya who decided to play
us a couple, namely, Low Red
Moon with its discordantly fluid
guitar and the rush along, manic
Dusted. She is too good to us. E

CURVE
King's College Union
I
n 1991 I heard a song called 10
Little Girls, from the debut EP
by a band called Curve. It was
the single most inventive, novel
sound I had ever heard up until
then (I had, admittedly, been a lit-
tle sheltered). Sure, baggy was
cool, but Curve were different.
Within a year, they had conquered
the 'indie' market with a string of
classic EP's. After two albums, and
a year of relentless touring, they
imploded amid rumours of break-
downs, addiction and ego over-
load. Bands like Garbage and
Sneaker Pimps took their blueprint
of sex, goth, elastic basslines and
more sex, and made a mint. And
suddenly, nobody remembered
Curve anymore. But they were
always too bloody-minded to just
lie down and die like a dog, and at
last they're back with their spank-
ing new single (Chinese Burn) get-
ting Sony Minidisc sponsored
advertising. In Kings College,
there's only really one question the
crowd want answered - are they
still relevant? And Curve answer
with a resounding errrmmmm.
Musically, they've taken the
next logical step on from their last
proper release, the Superblaster
EP, by becoming even more indus-
trial, trowelling on layers of fuzz
and noise over Toni Halliday's she-
devil vocals. Sweef Back and
Alligator sound like NIN remixed by
Third Eye Foundation, and it's wor-
ryingly apparent that the gorgeous
melodies of old may well have
been sacrificed for a even more
powerful sound. But all the time
Toni's voice brings the songs back
from the edge of meltdown as she
vents years of frustration on us,
looking more severe than ever in
lashings of black make-up and
a dead-crow hairstyle. A heavier
than ever Fait Accompli is revived
to a rapturous reception, and
things seem to be going to plan
until a faulty fire alarm forces us all
out of the building for half an hour.
When the gig finally resumes, Curve
rattle through Chinese Burn and
Come Clean before some desultory
guitar trashing and an almost
embarrassed exit. Still relevant
then? Errrmmmm.
