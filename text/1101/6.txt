MORE LETTERS 5 December 1997
types of music - we're just
getting so pissed off with
house, garage, techo blah
blah every weekend, it's like
Strawberry Sundae? Frisky? Peach?
Er I don't think! Yeah cheers thanks
alot! We can't be doing with 6
hours of fucking thud thud thud
every weekend - it gets sooooo
fucking boring.
You may laugh but just think of
those georgeous blokes in all those
cheesy clubs out there. I mean
people go to serious clubs to dance
- we love dancing but there just
ain't no chance to pull and get
pissed. It's like yeah cheers thanks
a lot, Move it! Ha Ha Ha.
Everyone knows about the
Hippodrome and Equinox but this
is cheesy as in commercial dance
(spin spin sugar... thud thud) then
I hour of here come the men in
black... never gonna let you go...
blah blah then 2 hours of crappy
dance tunes that just ain't heard
of... you know what 1 mean. [No.
Ed]
HOWEVER, we have been pre-
pared to put up with this so far
since there have been a regular lot
of sexy army lads mmmmmmmm
that we have been aquainted with
(good word).
So before this turns into an
essay, give us cheesy now! ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Hang on a
minute , some sexy bloke has just
walked in mmm yeah cheers
thanks a lot!
Er, I think I'll be ANON ha ha ha.
PS. This is a serious letter so
you'd better print it!
Dear Felix,
In lieu of the recent 1CU
Presidential election we at MS
thought that a few facts should be
put Into perspective. Combined as
we now are St Mary's and Charing
Cross and Westminster Medical
schools have approximately 1100
students and taking into account
the number of people on elective
or residency it is closer to 1000.
Out of these 1000 people, there
were more than 700 votes cast and
even us inumerate medical stu-
dents can work out that this
equates to a 70% turn out. 1C non-
medics however, of which there
about 7000, still only managed to
equal the medics with about 700
votes also, again with these easy
numbers it is clear to see that there
was only a 10% turn out. Now there
is only one way to say this to you
guys (and girls) over there... you
are pants!
So, does this mean the begin-
ning of the end for IC? If this result
means that we as medics are 7
times more motivated than non-
medics on issues such as Student
Union affairs can this be extrapolat-
ed into other areas of IC? An
Interesting fact that you might not
be aware of is that the average
annual intake into any single acad-
emic course at IC is around 30 stu-
dents on the other hand next year
the intake into ICSM will be just
over 300 which means that by the
year 2002 there will be nearly 2000
medics at IC. With this number of
students each with 7 times the
motivation than their non-medic
counter parts is there any hope left
for 1C? Well I'll leave this tricky one
up to your imagination but what 1
will say to you is don't worry about
being swallowed up by IC.
P.S. Enjoy the rest of your edu-
cation at Imperial College of
Medicine, Science and Technology.
