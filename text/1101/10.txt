10 COLUMNS 5 December 1997
On Monday a new
Electoral Reform
Commission was
appointed by Tony Blair. In the
chair was Lord Jenkins of Hillhead,
veteran Liberal and Chancellor of
Oxford. The idea of reforming our
electoral system seems good - it is
surely ripe for improvement, the
previous Government have sat on it
during their lengthy reign. The 'first
past the post' system whereby
Members of Parliament are chosen
from constituencies, each one
electing the person who received
most votes, causes many electoral
reformers to wince. Our beloved
Union even elects its officers by the
Single Transferable Vote (if you
want an explanation of that then
ask at the Union). Public opinion is
warming to the idea of change.
The only problem, in fact, with
PR is a simple one. It doesn't work.
It's not a new idea, despite what its
proponents may say. It was moot-
ed during the 1832 Reform Bill, and
enacted in the 1867 Reform Act.
Three member constituencies
existed, with each elector having
two votes, so the third seat could
go to a minor party. In reality the
dominant party instructed its sup-
porters to spread their votes so it
could grab all three seats. It caused
such a political upset in the
Commons that it was discarded.
Purer forms of PR exist today,
notably in New Zealand, Ireland,
Israel, France and Germany. All
have had their successes, but the
failures are grave. Italy has just
reformed its system to something
remarkably like the 'first past the
post system', having had more gov-
ernments in the last decade than
we have had this century.The rea-
son for this is the coalition prob-
lem, something that we don't have,
due to the two party tradition and
our particular constitution. In our
government, the Prime Minister is
in effect a temporary dictator,
whose word becomes law. He is
under continuous scrutiny, and the
public can kick him and his govern-
ment out after five years. This cre-
ates a 'strong executive' which
deserved, since the government
obviously didn't get the mandate it
required. However, small parties
can exact a greater price. If they are
big enough, or can band together
to become big enough, their con-
tinued support may become essen-
tial for the government to rule.
Take the 1977-79 Lib-Lab pact,
where Scots and Welsh called the
shots, and the Ulster Unionists
managed even to increase the
number of MPs they had represent-
ing the area. Governments that
depend on coalition support have

means the P M and Cabinet can
determine policy with only advice,
their own conscience and public
opinion determining it. In a coali-
tion, minor parties lend their sup-
port in all government bills whether
they like them or not, in order for a
number of concessions. The con-
cessions they exact would presume
to be in proportion to the votes
they receive. They may also
demand ministerial positions. This
would tie the hands of the govern-
ment to particular policies, and
cause any ministerial reshuffle to
consider party affiliations over
other considerations. This may be
historically shown to be unstable
and unable to rule in the public
interest, simply ruling to serve its
own coalition partners - thereby
betraying the very people who
elected it.
The other, and perhaps more
insidious problem with PR is the
growth of the power of the Party.
Pr has become known as "Party
Rules". Once you have some PR
system, lists are required of candi-
dates to fill seats, so when the
seats are allocated, the party can
take the top however-many people
and 'issue' them with a seat. This
creates a tremendous power. MPs
who dissent against the party line
may find themselves lower down
the list next time - in some coun-
tries, being moved a place down
the list is the standard punishment
for MPs' 'misdemeanours'. This
power will be retained from the
smallest party to the largest. Under
this system, M P s in the party's
good books may not worry so
much come election time. If high
up on the list, they are almost guar-
anteed a seat. In the 'first past the
post' system, because the swing in
the chamber is far more pro-
nounced than the swing in public
opinion, you may find yourself out
on your ear, as many Tories in for-
mer safe seats are adjusting to.
Parties that take a mauling in this
system, with no hope of power for
a number of years, are more likely
to critically examine themselves
and try to change for the better
than they would under a system
that simply slapped them on the
wrist (or the party could simply
self-destruct, which not unknown).
The other reason suggested for
Labour's and the Lib Dem's PR idea
is that there is a permanent left-of-
centre consensus, which many
believe would rule for ever if in
power. PR would help this. The
Tories said the same thing in the
early eighties - look what happened
to them. In reality, if the voter
wants you out, there is no genuine
electoral system on earth that will
stop them.
CARROT CAKE
This week's insight into culinary
fantasia is really easy, really
cheap, really healthy and really
really tasty.
You will need:
«" 6 oz (150 g) carrots
2 medium eggs
4 oz (100 g) demerara sugar
*" 3 fl oz (80 ml) sunflower oil
•»" 4 oz (100 g) wholemeal self-
raising flour
1 tsp ground cinnamon
*" Vz tsp ground nutmeg
or any multiple thereof.
Grate the carrots using the
prickly side of a cheese grater. Try
not to grate the end of your fin-
ter
gers as well but if you do, don't
worry the blood won't spoil the
flavour. In a large bowl mix the
eggs and the sugar and whisk
together with a fork until all the
sugar has dissolved and the mix-
ture has become slightly fluffy. Try
to get as much air into it as possi-
ble by lifting the fork out of the
liquid at each revolution. Now
add the oil by pouring it into the
bowl as a very thin trickle and
whisking away vigorously at the
same time. An extra pair of hands
can be very useful at this stage.
Once the oil is in, add the grated
carrots and any juice they've pro-
duced and give it a quick stir.
Finally, gently fold in the flour and
spices. By folding, I mean deli-
cately scooping some mixture up
from the bottom of the bowl and
plonking it back on top until all the
flour is just absorbed. The aim
here is to keep as many air bub-
bles in the paste as possible
which makes for a lovely light
cake.
Now heavily grease and flour
your favourite cake tin, pour in the
slop and put in the oven, preheat-
ed to 375°F, 190°C, gas mark 5.
The cake should take 20-25 min-
utes to cook. To check whether
it's ready or not, poke a knife in
the cake and pull it out. If the
knife comes out clean, the cake is
ready, if it comes out with bits
attached, the cake is not. Sorted?
