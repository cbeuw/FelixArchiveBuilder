Top Guns
Once again the weather was kind
to us for our second trip to Hawley
for some clay pigeon shooting.
Nick's navigation and Jacob's dri-
ving lead to some worried faces
and one case of travel sickness but
we arrived on time and started the
day with a 40 bird practice round.
All of those who had shot before
improved upon last time and the
novices of the group suprised
themselves by actually shooting
quite well on most stands. We then
went round again for the individal
shoot which gave the honours to
Ed Catton for being the high gun,
still he is a farm boy and nothing
less was expected. Rupert Ingham
shot consistently for second place
using his recently aquired Merkel
12 bore wire guided missile system
which he bought less than a month
ago from a bloke who saw him
coming a mile off.
After being refreshed with copi-
ous teas and some food we set
about the main business of the day,
the inter CCU skeet match. This is
25 clays shot from 2 traps at 7
stands and is one of the Olympic
shooting disciplines. Due to light-
ing conditions scores were general-
ly lower than anticipated but again
Ed proved equal to the task. The
end result was a victory to the C&G
partially due to the fact they had 6
shooters to the RCS 4 and the RSM
3. The statistics can be argued for
ever and the original suggestion of
nominating teams alphabetically
gave the closest result.
Those going full bore rifle
shooting this Saturday should meet
at the Sports Centre at 8am. The
archery coaching of Colin Ledsome
will be in a regular slot starting at
3pm on Wednesdays. We will enter
a BUSA team even next term even
if it does cause laughter amongst
the opposition but it will be wise to
field the best team we can so get
on down and show us what you
can do.
B-ball
Three action-packed weeks for
IC's ladies! If UCL had not shame-
lessly injured 3 of our players, 2 of
when are out for a long while, we
would no doubt only have victories
to write about. Indeed, this charm-
ing team has succeded in breaking
an ankle, our captain's nose, and
(well, nearly) our goddess shooter
Pat D.'s finger. Treacherous villany
are the words.
Nevertheless, spirits remain
high. As it stands, the team is cur-
rently top of the League, and has
an excellent chance of reaching the
top 32 in BUSA.
Claire D.'s shots deserve a
special mention, together with
Sandrine B.'s offensive efforts dur-
ing Friday's match against
Goldsmiths. We look forward to
more stunning performances from
our female basketballers.
Downhill All the Way
for IC Skiers
HUSKI'S SERIES
The first race of the Huski's
series was held on Sunday
evening in Welwyn Garden-City.
Despite being short of racers
(due to multiple injuries in the first
race) we managed to enter a team
comprising of Alex Clerdel, Alex
Wright, David Wahl, Caitlin Wroe
and Izabelle Kaminska.
The race consisted of two
timed individual runs dow a slalom
course followed by a head to head
dual slalom race. There were some
good performances all round,
especially considering that two
members had never raced before.
Caitlin won the Ladies slalom.
In the team dual slalom, we
had rather an unlucky draw against
the "plastic playthings" (who's
team consists mainly of ex-
England team members) in our first
race so we were knocked out
instantly. Despite this we gave a
brave performance and didn't lose
by too much of a margin!
SOMETHING ELSE?
For the first, and probably the
last time this season, Imperial
managed to remain unbeaten all
evening. Despite winning all of
our races we somehow only man-
aged to finish in 15th place over-
all. How is this possible? We may
be great skiers, but sadly our ori-
enteering skills are somewhat
lacking. Both cars managed to
get lost, and as a result we
missed the first round of races.
After sweet-talking the judges
we were allowed to enter a single
team in the remaining rounds.
With only a few practise runs
before the second round of racing,
we easily managed to crush our
inferior opponents in the four
remaining races.
Despite missing half of the
races, we finished a respectable
15th, with some awesome dis-
plays of skiing, most notable from
Caitlin racing against her older
brother.
Rugby
The Imperial Medicals 1st &. 2nd
XVs have finished with unbeaten
records at the top of their respec-
tive BUSA league groups, securing
promotion into the Southern
Premier league, where they will
hope to compete on a level footing
with the likes of Brunei, Exeter &.
Bristol. The I st XV took their group
by storm as opposition teams
struggled to contain a pack that
was both powerful and mobile and
the backs were allowed to display
some breathtaking running and
handling skills in attack, scoring a
massive total of 401 points in the
seven games. Fierce tackling in
defence meant that the team only
conceded 53 points in total in the
league.
The road to the top of the
league was marginally harder for
the 2nd XV and the final game of
the league saw them facing
Portsmouth in a game they had to
win. With 10 minutes remaining,
the scoreline read 29-20 in the
oppositions favour. However, the
unyielding spirit of the medics cre-
ated a breathtaking finish to the
match and a try in the corner on
the stroke of full time sealed the
narrowest of wins and snatched
the league away from the grasp of
a dispirited Portsmouth side.
Hockey
Holloway I y ICHC I
The firsts set out with an air of
expectancy after their Godlike tri-
umph in the group stages (P6 W5
Dl L0). On a grey day at a pitch
best described as crap, we battled
out a hard fought contest on a
frozen afternoon.
After an underserved goal from
an underserved short corner, we
piled on the pressure to equalize
through top scorer and God-like
captain Chicken-Bol. The first half
ended in a flurry of IC efforts only
to end with scores level.
The second-half started just as
the first with heavy Holloway pres-
sure. With the Storm Weather a
new look team out on the road for
a goal. Sadly it was not to be.
Through some shocking refing,
they were awarded a penalty
which was missed. Another bout of
IC pressure ended with a RH play-
er catching the ball and not being
sent off(as should have been his
punishment), someone knee-cap-
ping Sid the Sexist (no card again)
and another penalty for them for
no reason (which they scored). At
the end of the day, Brian, Hockey
was the loser.
