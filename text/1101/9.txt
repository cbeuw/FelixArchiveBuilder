5 December 1997 COLUMNS
You have escaped politics for a
couple of weeks, so I'm afraid
you'll have to indulge an old man
for a few minutes. Is it me, or has
young Mr Mandelson disap-
peared? A short time ago, the king
of spin was omnipresent, but of
late He seems to have vanished up
his own rebuttal. By pure coinci-
dence, wheels are failing off the
New Labour bandwagon with all
the drama of Nigel Mansell's
Williams, an unfortunate analogy
in the current circumstances.
Mandelson is in the unfortunate
position of being both invaluable
and politically unacceptable. Such
is the mastery of His brief (sub-
verting the democratic
process/running Britain), He has
been a victim of His own success.
Surely Mandy would have spotted
Tobaccogate before it got messy.
No doubt He would have known
that cutting benefits to single
mothers would enrage His back-
benchers. At this rate, the growing
signs of political arrogance should
be reigned in by public disgruntle-
ment. One can but hope.
I shall now do something that I
rarely, if ever, do in this august
journal. 1 shall say something nice
about College Catering. I had the
occasion to be at the 75th
A n n i v e r s a r y
Dinner of The
'22 Club on
Saturday. I must
say that, save for
a couple of
minor glitches,
Catering did a
very good job.
The food was
good, as was the
wine and the
service. It just
goes to show
that this department can perform
when it gets its act together. Many
of the Catering staff moan that 1
always accentuate the bad points
and ignore the achievements, but
until you pay me a small retainer, 1
shall not act as your PR agent.
However, when I eat a good meal
cooked by you, I shall say so. As 1
just have.
Being in the M D H , 1 could not

avoid the Ante Room, currently
housing an 'exhibition' by two
'artists.' Though so much has
already been said about this, I feel
I should have my two 'penneth.
While I have no
desire to meet
the two talentless
cretins responsi-
ble for this
-inevitably at
some point in its
conception- utter
waste of taxpay-
ers' money, I
would dearly love
to meet the per-
son that wrote
the biographical
sketches of these creative non-
entities. To describe a video of a
few peas and model sheep vibrat-
ing on a washing machine as
'immensely funny' indicates that he
or she is peerlessly ironic or deeply
disturbed (or the recipient of a
back-hander). The Ante Room,
after its recent refurbishment, has
been raised from the status of a
hovel to a fine venue. For it to be
used to accommodate such
rubbish, bereft of any talent,
is verging on the criminal. I am, as
you all know, very broad-minded,
ever-willing to embrace new ideas
or thinking, but this is too much. A
much better idea would be to
obtain works of art from other col-
lections. The Rector, for instance,
could surely negotiate the loan of
pieces from the vast M O D collec-
tion, given his long-standing asso-
ciation. While 1 am certainly keen-
er on eighteenth century water-
colours, Britain does have some
very good contemporary artists.
These muppets sadly are not in
that category. As they say in
Barnsley, I don't much about art,
but I know what 1 like.
