TRASH, BASICALLY
THE BLACK BOOK
BOOKS 21
Sara Keays
I
was bitterly disappointed by
this book. Instead of the siz-
zling bonkbuster about a beau-
tiful female Parliamentary secretary
who gets seduced by the evil politi-
cian-on-the-rise, culminating in his
sacking from the Cabinet, and
reneging on a promise to marry her
even though she is pregnant with
his child, it's a rather tame thriller
about a book containing scan-
dalous stories about the dealings of
MPs and the impact that these sto-
ries might have on the country. In
view of Ms Keays being the former
mistress of the now Lord
Parkinson, I was expecting far, far
more than this. According to the
Electronic Telegraph, many
Conservative MPs were to read the
book avidly in fear of recognising
themselves. Ms Keays's novel,
which she has said is based on her
"life and times", avoids parallels
with her affair, which is a shame,
since all the scandals under this
government have been very dull,
and probably hushed up by the
spindoctors.
The book paints a picture of
corrupt and hypocritical MPs
whose misdemeanours are noted
in a "Black Book" guarded by the
Chief Whip, Harry Hunter. Jo, a
beautiful, tall, slender widow, with
pensive blue eyes, and a thoughtful
mouth, the usual type of high pow-
ered secretary, is temporarily work-
ing for this unpleasant, adulterous
man, whilst his permanent secre-
tary is on sick leave. She is asked
by his wife to visit his London Flat,
and whilst there, finds the "Black
Book", and is scandalised by what
she reads. In doing this, she's
spotted by a member of the CIA,
who is watching the flat, apparent-
ly as a matter of routine. I'd like to
say that about five car chases and
six reverberating scandals later, she
is gunned down by the combined
forces of the British and American
secret services, but sadly, she isn't.
Instead, she hides the book, and
investigates. The ruling party, which
is assumed to be the Tories, tries to
discredit her allegations as the
"fantastical ravings of a deranged
female"; none the less she suc-
ceeds in jailing several MPs and
bringing down the Government.
Jo, a woman of principles, is
disillusioned to discover the
Houses of Parliament, and in par-
ticular the Commons, to be an
institution full of "oddballs and mis-
fits", many of them "arrogant little
shits". This will not come as much
of a surprise to anyone who has
ever read a newspaper or watched
the news. Most are "much more
interested in fame than sex" and
would prefer to be "on television
than in bed with a gorgeous girl".
However, I'm sure Messieurs
Merchant, Yeo, Parkinson, Mellor,
Spring, who allegedly prefers three-
in-a-bed, Booth and Hughes, all of
whom became famous due to their
habit of going to bed with gorgeous
girls, would disagree with that
statement. She is also horrified to
learn that many MPs are "too busy
earning fat fees from outside inter-
ests" to do their own work or to lis-
ten to their constituents. I could
reel off another list of corrupt and
hypocritical MPs, but I feel that
their names are already far, far too
familiar to most of us. The book is
full of praise for Commons secre-
taries, hmm, I wonder why, who
are treated "like battery hens"
whilst practically giving blood "for
some ambitious creep who takes
you for granted and gets all the
credit". Hell hath no fury like a
woman scorned
In a way, I liked this book even
though it is not at all as exciting as
it could have been. It's interesting
enough to read on a tube or bus, or
if you really have nothing better to
do. It strikes me as a bit of a
revenge fantasy, and maybe Ms
Keays would like to have seen the
entire Conservative party discredit-
ed by her actions, as opposed to by
their own. It's not as irritatingly
unput-downable as the last book I
reviewed, in fact I really can't
remember any point of distinction
in it at all. May I take this opportu-
nity to recommend the Telegraph
web page (www.telegraph.co.uk),
and to encourage people to search
for "sex scandals and Tories".
