About three weeks ago, I accepted an invita-
tion to travel out to Munich in Southern
Germany and take part in an experimental
radio show called Brainput. 1 decided to stay

some of the electronic music that you can
find coming out of this region. Munich is a
small, compact city and its scene is often
referred to as "the family". This has nothing
to do with the mafia, but is an affectionate
way of describing the closeness between the
different branches of music. Everyone seems
to support everyone else and homegrown tal-
ent is valued and nurtured.
From relative obscurity, Munich has grown
to a major force in European electronic
music; gaining respect from the international
techno community. For all its presence, only a
handful of underground labels arc prodwtajp
music out of the city. Each label has such a
varied and diverse sound that you feel the
whole electronic spectrum is represented.
Disko B has been putting out '
nearly as long as there was techno. Early
releases on the label were all cutting-edge
hard club techno. Artists such as Dj Hell
made sure that Disko B would always be
remembered as one of the top International
labels. As one of the world's leading techno
D|s he was also crucial in spreading the Diskou
B sound on a global scale. Musical highlights
from his career include the album Geteert
und Gefedert and the anthemic Jeff Mills
remix of Allersehen.
Disko B cannot be accused of staying with
its winning club-techno formula in order to
play it safe and sell more records. The philos-
ophy behind the label is not merely to move

CLUBSCENE - ALBUMS
GEMINI

IN NEUTRAL
Gemini walks
into a wall while
relaxing to his
album. Man.
L
ast week on the Electric Cafe
Spencer Kinsey (aka Gemini)
revealed his desire to have
the freedom to reach as many peo-
ple as possible with his music. He
claimed that five years with Relief
Records became claustrophobic
and perhaps hindered his ability to
do this. So what did he do to put
himself back on track? He recorded
three albums and released them all
within three months of each other!
All three are in the typically quirky
but catchy house/techno style of
Gemini, but each captures a differ-
ent period and mood in his career.
Following the heavy, frustrated
sounds of Imagine a Nation (Relief)
and the freer melodies of In and
Out of Fog and Lights (Peacefrog),
In Neutral is the third in the series.
It deals with the theme of relax-
ation and introspection as a means
of finding the energy and motives
to move forward once more.
We begin with Campanula and
Lifted Life both of which are a sub-
tle blend of house rhythms and
jazzy melodies. Although not the
best tracks by far, they provide a
solid start and an indication of
great things to come.
Great things come very soon.
Memory is the work of a vivid
imagination. Waves of sound wash
over a punchy beat and as this
track unfolds, stories are told and
sceneries painted. The effect is
awesome; when the volume is low
this is ideal listening music, but it
also makes for good dancefloor
material.
Gemini expounds his philoso-
phies and creates a very quirky
track with On This Planet. It is
unique to the Gemini sound; more
experimental than house, less
abrasive and slower than techno.
Ahi has a very trippy, happy-
go-lucky rhythm section, and is a
fresh change to some of the more
contemplative tracks on offer. This
is definitely for relaxation.
The disappointment of this
album is the down tempo, disco-
influenced title track In Neutral.
This would probably sound good if
it was not on this album, but
instead on another EP. Personally I
don't think it fits into the In Neutral
project, sounding too separate
from the other tracks on offer.
However this is quickly forgot-
ten with the next track, ?. This
piece plays with rhythm, shuffling
and clicking its way through. It is an
example of how to be experimental
and not cut off the mass of your
audience.
Gemini has created what he set
out to achieve in his own subtle
way. The emphasis is on how it
should be listened to rather than
where it should be played in a D]
set. The end result is an album that
begs the attention of your
ears...and your mind! rTlcl
