BEST OF THE OLDIES
I Three hundred years
•••HHPI into the future and the
ttf^^LJ world has become a
• H H desolate place. An
asteroid at the millennium has
brought about the collapse of civil-
isation and only now are the sur-
vivors of the cataclysm able to
rebuild their society.
You play Arkhan, a Guardian of
Fire in the city of Sparta, a sort of
army lieutenant in a bustling out-
post offering salvation and shelter.
After being disfigured by a deadly
poison your task, as Arkhan, is to
go in search of a cure. However the
city is full of treachery and where
those at the echelons of power are
forging ahead with their own agen-
das, Arkhan will undoubtedly cross
their paths.
Dark Earth is a 3rd person
adventure game, with you in com-
plete control of the 3d character of
Arkhan. Controlling the character
around the beautifully pre-rendered
screens is a treat, the animated
characters are fluid (166MHz PC is
recommended) and the in game
speech is varied and unobtrusive,
since you can read the text and
then skip the speech which runs
concurrently. The game play is not
limited to picking up objects and to
talking to other characters, a com-
bat mode allows Arkhan to fight in
full 3d, and with a huge assortment
weapons, from axes to rifles.
The story line is incredibly tight
and you find yourself going from
one place to another because you
simply have no other options. At
times Dark Earth is frustrating when
you get stuck but this is the same
with all role playing games but the
simplistic keyboard control, the
medieval look of the game and the
real time 3d graphics, makes you
persevere.
There are quite a few adventure
games out at the moment, so com-
pared with other adventure games
such as Blade Runner reviewed last
week, which one should you go
for? Personally 1 found Blade
Runner's plot far to complicated
with too many threads happening
all at the same time. Its four CDs
are quit a bit daunting, but the
game wraps you totally in its Blade
Runner atmosphere and this is
what makes it an excellent game.
Dark Earth on the other hand has a
greater pace and you will find your-
self moving swiftly between
screens but there are enough stum-
bling blocks to keep the game chal-
lenging. So you could play a game
with a 20 year old history and that
has been rehashed in every single
science fiction film or you could go
for something that has an original
theme with equally excellent graph-
ics and game play. Q

TEKKEN I & II
N a m c o * * * * *
E
arly this century, Maxwell
stated that man knew all
there was to know about
physics, we just had to fill in a few
details.
In Early 1996, 1 stated that
Tekken was the best combat game
there was. Maxwell was soon
proved wrong with the develop-
ment of atomic physics, and I was
soon proved wrong when Namco
released Tekken2.
When Tekken 1 was released,
along with the playstation, it was a
truly ground-breaking game, but
did not achieve wide recognition
due to the large number of combat
games on the market. Tekken was,
and is, a superb game combing
speed, fine graphics and a wide
array of characters with plenty of
humour and a hundreds of slick
moves to give a game that never
gets boring. Better still, smashing
the shit out of your flatmates/ene-
mies using a heavily armoured
tiger, with all the sound and gory
graphics to boot, certainly helped
to preserve my sanity during my
degree. The number of websites
that can be found, created by
fanatic devotees of the game and
intent on documenting every one
of the moves, features and tricks
bears testimony to the excellence
of Tekken.
So when my flatmate, in one of
his more god-like manoeuvers,
returned to the nest with a copy of
the newly released Tekken 2, I did-
n't see how much it could have
improved over its predecessor. The
answer is; a great deal. The game
had improved so much, in fact, that
leaving the flat for lectures was out
of the question. Tekken had given
me an aim in life - something tangi-
ble I could actually achieve - to
beat up the world and its mother
using my very own digital super-
hero.
Namco had added another
bunch of characters, improved the
speed, graphics and playability,
overhauled the menu system and
included two new modes - a prac-
tice mode and a team battle mode.
Oh, and did I mention shed loads
more moves? All these changes
made it easier to get sucked deep-
er into the game, and 1 was.
So this time, unlike Maxwell,
I'm going to get this right; Tekken2
is the second best combat game.
Make way, mortals, for TEKKEN3

Tekken2 costs around £35 from
the usual outlets. Tekken can be
picked up second hand for £10 -
£15. Computer Exchange on
Rathbone St, off Oxford St is par-
ticularly recommended.
