BUSA controversy
JEREMY THOMSON
Imperial College Union Council is
likely to have its most lively
meeting this year when it con-
venes on Tuesday.
The controversy has arisen over
entries to BUSA (the British
Universities Sports Association),
the backbone of inter-university
sports competition. In recent
years, St Mary's Medical School
has registered seperately from
Imperial College, but this is now in
debate. Eric Allsop (ex-president of
1CU) and Katie Armstrong
(President of ICSMU) have submit-
ted conflicting motions to council,
with Mr Allsop recommending a
move to single entry and the med-
ical officer hoping to field a seper-
ate ICSM team.
Captains of all sports teams
have been requested to attend and
a large delegation is expected from
the medical campuses. Due to the
expected size of the meeting and
the strength of opinions involved,
ICU is considering drafting in extra
stewards to maintain order.
Felix has also heard that the
new president of the Royal College
of Science Union, Helen-Louise
Windsor, will be tabling a motion to
forbid smoking during the meeting.
The meeting will be held at
6pm in the Union Dining Hall and is
open to all students.
Chemistry Meltdown

inadequate maintenance, but the
status of talks is being kept confi-
dential.
A number of subsequent sur-
veys have been carried out on the
whole electrical system of Chem 2,
in order to reaffirm safety levels
that were previously taken for
granted. Thermal imaging has
been employed to identify any
hotspots within the system, as they
signify dangerously high levels of
current. The unofficial conclusion
of this analysis gives the building a
clean bill of health.
Maintenance manager, Chas
Guirey explained how arrange-
ments are being made to have a
full visual inspection of the system
in the near future. This will involve
isolating each floor and manually
surveying all electrical routes. This
practice usually takes place every
six years, but has been moved for-
ward by two years in order to
ensure high standards of safety; it
is presumed there will be no faults
found as a result of this inspection.
News in Brief
SOUTHSIDE
BRAWL
A fight which broke out in
Southside bar on Friday 21st has
led to the bar management
enforcing their rules on not allow-
ing any outside members into the
bar.
The events of the night started
when the bar opened at 5pm with
five or six men were waiting at the
bar. The men were approached by
Gareth Parry, Senior Barman, who
suspected that they were outside
contractors. They replied saying
that they were Imperial College
Gardeners, and were taken on
their word when they failed to
produce identification. Mr Parry
was warned later that night by a
drinker in the bar that the men
were starting to get loud, who
decided it best not to approach
them at the time. The next time
that Mr Parry's attention was
drawn was when one of the stu-
dents in the bar came out from
around the pool table bleeding
heavily as a result of a split nose,
according to Mr Parry, after being
head butted by one of the men.
The bar staff then proceeded to
eject the party from the bar. The
student then went to the toilet
with one of the bar staff and
returned apparently OK, although
he was taken to hospital by his
worried friends.
Although the incident was iso-
lated Mr Parry has advised all his
staff that no contractors are
allowed on the premises. The inci-
dent is still under investigation by
college security, but is being hin-
dered by a veil of silence that has
fallen over the incident, and also
the fact that the identity of the
party has not been established.
ELECTRONIC
LOCKS LEAVE
R O O M S INSECURE
It has emerged that a few of the
new locks which were recently fit-
ted in Beit Hall could be opened
using an Imperial College Union
card.
The new system uses cards
that contain electronic informa-
tion which then opens the lock,
but due to bad fitting and the
design of the locks and frames it
was possible to open the locks by
sliding a flexible card between the
door and frame and forcing the
lock to open. The fault was first
discovered by one of the resi-
dents and was reported to the
wardens who acted quickly to
resolve the problem. All the locks
have now been checked and the
faults have been repaired.
The locks were put in to
increase the security of the rooms
as any lost keys would not result
in the re-fitting of a new lock but
simply reprogramming it.
World AIDS day was marked on Monday 1st by a now traditional red
ribbon mounted on the front of the union building. The day featured
infomation stalls and the sale of red ribbons. Photo: Ivan Chan
