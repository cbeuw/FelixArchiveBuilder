So great it's unbelievable
ICFC I v Golds I
First team captain Chris Soberg
escaped with a warning following a
meeting with a ULU disciplinary
committee, even though the com-
mittee stressed that his offence
against UMDS was "pathetically
tiny" rather than "small" as report-
ed by Felix last week. Injuries gave
Tony Boyce and Felix Schroeder
their First team debuts, while Jules
Porreca and Phillip Siverns were
recalled, the latter after a 28-year
spell with the Seconds.
Goldies dominated early on,
but failed to create scoring oppor-
tunities, and it wasn't surprising
when Warren Brayn crossed for
Boyce to score on his debut.
In the second half Goldsmiths
equalised when poor marking gave
Goldies' a free header from 5 yds
from a corner kick. Goldsmiths
then took the lead when confusion
between Psycho and Steve Fleming
led to Goldies' top scorer scoring
his 7th goal against Imperial in 3
seasons. Brayn made it 2-2 with a
clinical finish after he was put
through by Porreca. Brayn then got
Imperial's third with a great strike
from 30 yards. Perhaps not unde-
servedly Goldies equalised after
Siverns had left a huge gap down
Imperial's left hand side.
ICAFC 1 3 - 3 Goldsmiths I
ICFC IV v George's II ICWFC v City
The herd of buffalo that are the IC
Fourths continued their winning
rampage up the League, with a
dominating performance over the
Muppets at Cobham.
We are now probably the high-
est placed Fourth-team in the
whole of the London University
Football, but better still we are
placed ahead of IC Thirds in our
league. As with the Georgian mili-
tary coup of 1963 the victors start-
ed badly and if Georges could have
shot as straight as the Soviet army
they would have been three goals
up. As it was, the Fourths fluked a
goal against the run of play and let
Georges equalise before going on
to dominate the rest of the game.
Speaking words of wisdom,
Andy Swift superbly marshalled the
defence that was also Perez, David
and Paul, a player who is surely
playing the best footie of his
career. But as usual the attacking
players will always take the most
credit; Darren 'Dazzler' Boland,
(perhaps back to his best) scored a
hat-trick, old bastard Morgan a
brace, Serge a Zola-esque free-
kick, and both Dave and Perez
quality goals.
Even that half-wit with the hat
played OK...

Ed's greatest hits
(and kicks)
The ULU karate squad have been
involved in a few scrapes over the
year. The first was in the Southern
Regionals. Around seven rounds
were fought before Ed Dos Santos
qualified - this was gonna be tough.
The fight started with both fighters
testing one-another reflexively. Ed
was acting the aggressor. His
opponent was having none of it.
Ed launched with a Tobi Uraken-
Uchi flying back fist strike.
However, it was anticipated; the
attack was blocked and a Gyak
(reverse punch) was piled to Ed's
mid-section. Ed a was a Half-Point
down, fight re-started, this time
with more movement. Ed faked
and threw a Reverse punch which
Landed making it evens. With time
clocking, the next point would
surely win. Fortunately Ed landed a
solid backhand blow to the face
Ed took the Southern Regional
Individual Male Kumite (Sparring)
Title and won the Enoeda award for
best fighting spirit that year. In the
individuals, Ed had progressed well
until he faced the best karateka
from Cambridge. It was a close call
but Donny took it on the day.
When the ULU team went back
to Chesterfield in an attempt to
retain the student national title, Ed
was looking good. He had to face
Pat, an England KUGB fighter who
had beaten him in the open
nationals in Summer. They knew
each other and the fight saw a few
exchanges. After a long and drawn
out affair, Ed got caught with a
blow to the body to send him out.
It was cold, wet and miserable, but
this did nothing to dampen the
enthusiasm of 7 IC players who left
the shelter of west London to
brave the 5 a side team of City uni-
versity. The game started well,
with IC continually taking shots.
Unfortunately they had a keeper
who could actually keep. But with
persistance Wee Marissa actually
put one in. We swapped players at
1/3 time and feeling confident
started to play again.
Unfortunately, Vasso of the 5-a-
side rules conceded a penalty
when she stepped in the circle.
With the score at one all the stakes
were high, and it was at this
moment that the opposition's
coach noticed Wee Marissa's
superb ball handling skills and set
two men on her. But this did leave
Hacker Lyle free to play off some
superb crosses from Oily and the
now bleeding Medic, eventually
scoring two more goals.
During the 2nd interval Amy
complained about not touching
the ball (she was in goal). Despite
her state of mind, she occasionally
put down her book long enough to
save a penalty. In the final third
with encouragement from
Katherine, both Wee Marisa and
Hacker Lyle scored making it 3 and
a hat-trick for Hacker Lyle.
At the end of the evening we
were jubilant at having won our
first 5 a side match of the season.

ICFC II v King's II
With the future of King's College
football club in doubt after a Â£700
fine for poaching a ref, IC met the
King's seconds in despondent
mood. With third team ringers Jag,
John and Johnno the seconds were
by no means assured of victory. As
the game began IC looked so good
it was untrue, but as the half pro-
gressed King's became increasing-
ly dominant and it was only superb
defending from Loz, Phil The Pill,
Jules and Johnno kept us in the
game - allowing Martin's superb
goal to separate the teams at half
time. Shielding the ball, he turned
and shot in one motion from the
penalty spot and curled it into the
top corner.
In the second half King's fell
apart and we heaped on the humil-
iation with Jag scoring two on his
debut, Jules scoring a fine goal and
Martin sealing a fine performance
with his third goal of the season.
Special praise must be given to
Chris "Scouse" Barlow who was
superb in goal as he has been al!
season - player of the year so far.

lii a shock result tonight, the elite
of Men's rugby were crushed by
the superior drinking prowess of a
ladies' hockey ream in a boat race.
I his result highlights both die vvoe-
ful abilities of men's rugby anil the
alcoholic might of ladies' hockey.
Grandmaster Mestel
and the Furious Fifty
How would you like to take on a
world-famous Grandmaster at
chess? Not really up to that stan-
dard? OK, let's even it up a little -
we'll give the Grandmaster 50
opponents at the same time.
Interested now? On Monday 15
December Dr Jonathan Mestel of
the Maths Department will be giv-
ing a simultaneous display of his
chess skills. Dr Mestel is a
Grandmaster twice over, having
received the title for "over the
board" play and for "problem solv-
ing" - the only person in the world
to hold two Grandmaster titles.
Given the circumstances this is
probably the best chance you'll
ever get to beat a Grandmaster. If
you lose you'll be in good compa-
ny, and if you win (or even draw)
you'll be a hero!
The Challenge will take place in
Lecture Theatre 341 in Huxley
(Maths), starting at 6.30pm. ALL
CHESS-PLAYING MEMBERS OF
THE COLLEGE ARE INVITED, but
places are limited and priority will
be given to students. Light refresh-
ments will be provided for those
taking part. Spectators are wel-
come. To book your place in the
Mestel Challenge, or for further
information about the Chess Club,
please contact Bany Gale,
b.j.gale@ic.ac.uk.
