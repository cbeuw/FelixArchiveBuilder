Meltdown
ANDREW OFORI
Sparks flew this week in the
Chemistry Two building as an elec-
trical fault resulted in a power
surge throughout the first floor
mains system. On Sunday 16th
November at around 7pm all lights
on the first floor of the building
began to flicker and blow; the air
conditioning system failed; dor-
mant electrical appliances eerily
switched themselves on and the
culmination came with the explo-
sion of electrical equipment.
The College's electricians car-
ried out extensive work to restore
power to the devastated first floor.
The power surge caused substan-
tial damage and in the aftermath, it
became apparent there was a fun-
damental flaw in the mains sys-
tem. It is believed there was a
short in the riser that supplies the
first floor and as a result 415V
(compared with the 240V domes-
tic maximum) energised the neu-
tral wires in the mains system,
rendering many areas of the floor
extremely hazardous. Fortunately
there were no casualties.
Dr Rzepa, the incident's sole
witness, is now responsible for the
complex task of replacing
destroyed computer equipment.
He described the current cost of
the damage as "a five figure
value"; but the amount seems to
be rising daily as comprehensive
damage reports are submitted to
the department.
The college, which is insured, is
now embroiled in legal discussions
to establish responsibility, aided by
a number of safety inspection
reports from various parties. It is
believed that the fault is likely to be
due to sub-standard installation or

Library Annexed by SOAS Students
JEREMY THOMSON
Students at the School of
Oriental and African Studies
(SOAS), part of London
University, have seized control of
their library and are running it
themselves to provide twenty-
four hour access. The students,
who first occupied the building
on 20th November are now facing
a court order to evict them.
They are protesting against the
dwindling availablity of the main UL
library, Senate House, to SOAS stu-
dents. They see access to the
Senate House collection as essen-
tial to their studies, but the college,
which has to pay over Â£70 for each
library pass, claims that they can no
longer afford anough passes. The
protest was lauched by the SOAS
student union, who have given
overwhelming support to the
action in two seperate votes.
Around fifty protestors are liv-
ing in the building and are running
all the usual services, with the
exeption of the loan system -
books cannot be removed for fear
of theft. One activist described the
conditions inside: "I'm feeling as
though I've slept in a hedge... It's
very bright and surprisingly busy...
You close your eyes for a split sec-
ond and someone wakes you to
tell you that it's your turn to do...
horror of horrors... reshelving."
The students have been receiv-
ing support from many student
unions. They are viewing the sit-in
as a general protest against falling
university funding, and there are
rumours that they are considering
occupying Senate House itself.
