5 December 1997 FILM 25
Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh, Teri Hatcher
Director: Roger Spottiswoode
B
eautiful women, car chases
through crowded back
streets, a crazy villain
intent on world domination and
spectacular explosions. Yep, Bond
is back.
Tomorrow Never Dies is not
released until December 12th but
there is no Felix next week so we
are reviewing it early. The hype
and advertising has been
intensive and the eighteenth
installment is the most expensive
yet so the film has much to live
up to. Unfortunately, it never
quite meets the audience's
expectations.
All the essential elements of
a Bond film are present. This
time the villain is a Rupert
Murdoch-esque media baron
who intends to start World War
III purely to increase the circula-
tion of his global newspaper, the
"Tomorrow". Bond's ubiquitous
female ally appears in the form
of a Chinese agent played by
Michelle Yeoh, a star in Asian
action cinema, and Teri Hatcher
adds sex appeal to the proceed-
ings as the media mogul's wife.
The problem is that the entire
film lacks much of the excite-
ment of its predecessors and
each action sequence seems too
formulaic.
Tomorrow Never Dies begins
promising to be one of the Bond
greats. The pre-title set-piece is
laden with expensive effects and
sets the scene for an intriguing
story about the power of those
who control the news. There are
also some hilarious one-liners
from Moneypenny about Bond's
latest fling with a Danish
linguistics professor. However,
after this the film descends into
predictable action-packed scenes
which are too long and lack pace,
johnathan Pryce's villain does not
have the flamboyance of 007's
previous adversaries and there is
not enough interaction between
agent and nemesis.
At one point it seems as if the
film may redeem itself by giving
us an insight into a side of Bond's
character rarely seen. The media
baron's wife is a former girlfriend
of his and seems to be one of the
few women he misses and truly
feels for, We see Brosnan's Bond
drinking and appearing distressed
at being reminded of his former
lover. However, this is soon
forgotten and replaced by
explosions and fist-fights, giving
the impression of an opportunity
missed by the director.
It is not all bad news,
however. The film boasts a great
adversary for 007 in the shape of
a German assassin with a pen-
chant for torture. This sadistic
nutter, who claims to specialise
in making the murder of
pop stars appear to be
an overdose, is far more™
entertaining than Pryce's charac-
ter and deserves more screen-
time. Pierce Brosnan is more than
competent as Britain's premier
secret agent and portrays a more
vulnerable Bond than we have
seen lately. He bleeds when
punched and for once does not
instantly get his own way with the
females who cross his path.
All in all, this meets the stan-
dards of the last 17 Bond films
but does nothing to update the
series for the nineties. It is worth
seeing, and not only for the
blatant product placement
throughout its two hours running
time. It is just a pity that james
Bond still hasn't really found a
worthy adversary since the fall of
Communism. • Chris
