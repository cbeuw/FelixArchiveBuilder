Wet Ending Spoils Fine Fish
SHOOTING FISH
Starring: Stuart Townsend, Dan
Futterman, Kate Beckinsale
Director: Stefan Schwartz
M
ade with National Lottery
money and shot on loca-
tion around London on a
budget of $5m this is the second
film made by "The Gruber
Brothers" who met at York
University over ten years ago. Their
first film; Soft Top, Hard Shoulder
was released in 1993 and won two
Scottish Baftas.
Jez (Stuart Townsend) and
Dylan (Dan Futterman, last seen in
The Birdcage) are two affable,
twenty-something overqualified
and underemployed orphans.
Dylan is a fast talking Yank who
always says the right thing at the
right time but who cannot get a job
since he is chronically dyslexic. Jez
is a tongue-tied techno-nerd with
a lousy haircut. They have one
shared dream; to own a stately
home.
After launching a business sell-
ing fake voice-recognition systems
to multi-national companies they
meet Georgie (Kate Beckinsale).
Unknown to them, she is trying to
save her family estate which has
been converted into a centre for
Downs Syndrome children, one of
whom is her younger brother. In
order to do this she is marrying a
Kate Beckinsale plays the
apparently sweet Georgie
rich twit whom she doesn't love
but who has agreed to put up the
money to stop the sale.
Everything is going swimmingly
as jez and Georgie appear to be
falling for each other when it all
suddenly goes wrong. During a
scam the boys are recognised by
one of their previous victims and
imprisoned for three months.
If you walked out of the film
now then you would leave believing
that you were watching one of the
best British films ever, but it is not
to be. From that point on things
start to get silly. Whilst inside it is
announced that the day before
they get out fifty pound notes will
no longer be legal tender and, in a
cruel twist of fate, all their money
just happens to be in fifties. Aided
by Georgie they hatch an elaborate
plot to get out...
This had so much potential.
With a brilliant endearing cast and
a great 'BritPop' soundtrack
(Space, The Wannadies, Divine
Comedy, The Bluetones, Dubstar
for starters) it was on track to be
one of my favourite films ever
before the ending which just ruins
everything. 1 won't give it away
but it reduces the film to the level
of the usual Hollywood output. Go
and see it for the first 3/4 of the
film and just hope that the pro-
ducers suddenly have a change of
heart and refilm the finale before
its general release. D

STAR PROFILE
No. 1
Sandra Bullock
C
onsistently voted the
public's number one film
star, Sandra Bullock has
managed to stay at the top of
Hollywood despite some appaiing
films in the last few years. Speed Z
may have sunk without trace but
she's still the actress every studio
wants to sign, as shown by the
daily rumours linking her with the
upcoming Superman Lives.
Never one to bask in glory
she's moving into writing and
directing films. Her first is a 30
minute short, entitled Making
Sandwiches, in which Bullock also
stars. Next year will also see her
debut as a producer with Kate and
Leopold. Let's just hope she's
better at making films than picking
ones to act in...
