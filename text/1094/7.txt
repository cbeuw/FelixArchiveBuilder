17 October 1997 COLUMNS
Last time a Prime Minister met
the leader of the Irish
Republicanism, Lloyd George's
career was soon to end, and
Michael Collins' life was to go the
same way. The recent handshake
between Blair and Adams, may be a
historical moment, but we worry
what it might be remembered for.
Sinn Fein is not in talks to reach a
happy agreement, but in the word
of Martin McGuinness, to 'smash
the Union'. In the meantime, the
IRA maintains the means to return
to 'military operations' should the
talks not reach a 'satisfactory out-
come'.
Naturally Mr Adams welcomed
the decision, saying "we a re deal-
ing with a man who certainly recog-
nises that this is an historic oppor-
tunity... if there's going to be
change, it needs to be change by
the British government and I hope
Mr Blair will bring that about."
Senior Unionists expressed their
displeasure, with David Trimble giv-
ing the mild comment that "we
think it is rather sad that the Prime
Minster thinks it is necessary." The
crowds in the street were less sub-
tle, calling Blair, 'scum', 'filth' and
'traitor'. He required over fifty
bodyguards to escort him through
the streets.
The Prime Minister understands
that little if any progress will be
made if he becomes fixed in his
ways - indeed people in Northern
Ireland welcomed the change of
government as it gave a fresh
Northern Ireland, and finally the
Prime Ministerial Handshake. Bill
Clinton's handshake in December
1995 occurred remarkably soon
before the return to violence in
February 1996.
Politicians' handshakes never
had a great record in solving entan-
gled issues - witness Rabin and

impetus to the negotiations.
However it seems that the
Republican side are pocketing an
array of concessions with little sign
of any gestures in return. Prisoners
have been moved nearer their fam-
ilies, or released entirely, in both
the UK and the Republic, intern-
ment removed from the statute
book, weakening of the 'martial
law' that has been ever present in
Arafat's handshake in 1993. Rabin
was assassinated, his successor
lost the election, and the situation
now looks little short of a war. The
Republican movement have plenty
of 'progress' that they need to
make. Their situation is simple:
they want Northern Ireland as a
part of the Republic. The Unionists
want the status quo. As such, the
Republicans will shake hands with
anybody, as it improves |
their image (there's plenty
of progress that needs to be made
there too),and their case. The
Unionists are rather less keen on
shakes separatists' hands. This sit-
uation - the separatists' friendly
image - can be seen in any other
equivalent case (Scotland, Wales
etc.). Thus the republican joy at this
Handshake.
'Pressing the flesh' with Gerry
Adams, even if it is a calculated and
tactical move, is a highly dangerous
move in a game with big stakes (at
present over 3000 people lost their
lives in the Troubles). Blair will
know that his move will have weak-
ened the Unionist position in talks,
reducing their wish to compromise,
whilst leaving Sinn Fein with the
enviable position of having secured
a propaganda coup with no
response required. Those whose
position may need bolstering may
not be the terrorists' political
wings, but the democratic parties
whose patience has been so sorely
tested in the past weeks.
