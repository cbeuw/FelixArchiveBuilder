NEWS 17 October 1997
Yes, Mr President.
The race is on for the presidency
of Imperial College Union. As Felix
was going to print, only one candi-
date had signed up. Voting takes
place on the 1 1 th of November and
Mark Baker (Computing 4) is cur-
rently the only candidate for the
job. The other vacant post, Deputy
President for Clubs and Societies,
appears to have no candidates
standing as yet.
Like most student unions, ICU
is run by sabbaticals or 'sabbs',
elected annually, who have either
finished their degrees or have taken
a year out from their studies. ICU
has four sabbs: President, Deputy
President for Clubs and Societies,
Deputy President for Finance and
Services, and Felix Editor. Members
of ICU (any student with a union
card) are eligible to vote. Normally
voting takes place in March and the
sabbs-elect enter office, learning
their jobs from the previous incum-
bents in a hand-over period over
the summer.
However 1CU began this year
with only two sabbs instead of
usual four. The first round of elec-
tions, held in Spring 1996, saw two
candidates stand, one of whom
withdrew before voting took place -
the remaining candidate was
defeated by New Election. A fresh
round of elections was organised in
May, which drew three candidates.
Once again, two of them withdrew
and the remaining one was defeat-
ed by New Election. The final
round, held in July, saw four candi-
dates stand - one was to withdraw
- but many were surprised at yet
another victory for New Election,
given the quality of the candidates
that were standing (See Felix Ed.
1092).
The candidate for the presiden-
cy seemed optimistic. "I think my
prospects are good," Mr Baker
said. "1 like to think I'm a serious
and competent candidate who can
do the job." On the one-horse-race
in prospect, Mr Baker said that "it
would be quite worrying if no-one
else wanted to do the job as it
would mean that there was some-
thing tragically wrong with the
union," though he commented, "I'm
quite happy for it to be just me."
Talking to Felix, the ICU
President Eric Allsop said, "1 hope
there's more than one candidate
for the presidency to make it into a
race." He seemed unconcerned
that there would be a repeat of
what happened in previous round
of voting. 'You have to look at how
and why it happened," he said, say-
ing that this time round the circum-
stances were rather different. He
added that in spring 1996, poor
candidates had stood, and that
better candidates who had stood
later had been undone by a "band-
wagon" effect of people voting for
New Election. The voting system,
together with the medics' block
vote, had also "conspired against
us, by Mary's students failing to
express a second preference,"
specifically citing the case of final
round of votes held in July.
As regards the new round of
elections, he said, "We have at least
one good candidate...four people
expressed an interest - only one of
them serious... there's likely to be a
random fresher who'll want to get
their name known on campus."
If all goes to plan, a new presi-
dent will be elected on the 11 th of
November, after which Mr Allsop
will conduct a shortened hand-over
before returning to his research.
"I'm looking forward to getting back
to my PhD," he said.
He said that an incoming presi-
dent faced many challenges.
"Certain problems need solutions
expeditiously," he said, citing the
medical merger, improving student
facilities and the redevelopment of
Beit Quad after the moving of the
Biology department.

Do you have a license for that Union?
The Union's success in securing a
Public Entertainment License has
been clouded by aspects of
unforeseen Health and Safety
legislation. Union Stewards must
now enforce capacity limits on indi-
vidual rooms, as well as the total
limit on the whole Union building,
to keep in line with new license reg-
ulations.
Last year, the Union had to
apply for an extension on each
Wednesday and Friday night on a
fortnightly basis. This
led to uncertainty and,
as may be recalled,
resulted in midnight
bar-closing on several
occasions due to
license refusal last
term.
Having obtained
the P E License to
ensure regulated and
guaranteed late night
opening on Ents
nights, the Union is
now having to face a
new problem of
capacity restrictions
imposed by the Police and
Licensing Authority. Flow in and out
of dB's and Union bars must now be
regulated on Ents nights to abide
with the new conditions. This has
caused an absurd situation, experi-
enced first-hand by many at last
week's Fresher's Carnival. As the
hallways, foyer and staircases are
exempt from the room limits, they
are used as overflow areas for peo-
ple who are not allowed to enter full
rooms. At the Carnival, this led to
overcrowding in those areas and
main routes to fire escapes were
blocked off due to sheer numbers,
a situation that seems to have been
overlooked by the council.

Somewhat ironically on ordinary
nights the room restrictions do not
apply and any number of people
may crowd into the Union Bar.
In a sense, the Union has been
a victim of its own success. Three Home (Events and Marketing
years ago Union events were Manager) commented that " we've
sparsely attended but in the last always aimed for a safe environ-
eighteen months only three Ents ment and the license has now done
that". Although it has
always been the
Union's policy to act
responsibly, provid-
ing free tap water, the
chill-out room, first
aiders and a safe ratio
of Union stewards to
revellers, they are
now legally obliged to
do so.
In the short term,
as a partial solution,
Felix has just discov-
...and the result; many party-goers forced to ered that a represen-
stay in the less than salubrious lobby. Photo: Lili tative of the Licensing
Authorities paid a visit
nights have not sold out. The Union
sought the license to enable it to
provide a reliable service for its
ever growing "clientele" but in
doing so further restricted the
numbers able to benefit - one hun-
dred less tickets were available for
the recent Carnival. This highlights
the need for space in the Union
which is currently being addressed
by Eric Allsop (President of ICU).
The positive implications of the
license are that the Union must be
a safe place on Ents nights. Mark
to the Union on Wednesday and
advised that Da Vincis and the
Union Bar could be considered as
one room with a combined capaci-
ty of 300 thus allowing more than
50 people into the Union Bar.
