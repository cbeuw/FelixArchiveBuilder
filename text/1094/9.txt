17 October 1997 COLUMNS
After the semi-organised chaos of
freshers' week, life at IC has
returned to normal, with the
resumption of furrow ploughing.
The new students are finding their
feet (some are even finding their
lectures) and the BMS comes clos-
er to infestation by medics. This is
beginning to look like a very nice
building and is a credit to Schal.
WeVe had our differences in the
past, but I must say they're doing a
rather good job. Thanks must
again to Phil Hilton for letting me
have a peek at the site. To show
that the year really has started,
Sherfield has begun haemorrhag-
ing cash at a rate that the board of
British Leyland could only dream
of in the 1970s. This week, the vil-
lain of the peace is the Conference
Office.
Many of you will be aware that
we hosted part of The London
Fashion Week recently, which a
huge marquee and some seriously
well appointed females. As the
event has grown, the Natural
History Museum has become too
small, leaving Queen's Lawn the
only suitable area around here.
Marvellous, you say. Great chance
to make a few quid. Big event like
that has enor-
mous scope for
charging through
the nose,
enabling the
College to do
very well.
£20,000, maybe
£30,000? Oh
dear. Imperial
College didn't
even break even.
Now I'm no
expert, but I
would have thought that it is
impossible to mess up such a
golden opportunity as badly as
Annette De Lima and her staff did
in this case. Suggestions that no
additional security was costed in
the estimate are incredible, even
by the standards of this depart-
ment. Over the summer, confer-
encing also landed themselves in a
situation where rooms in
Southside were being let to a lan-
guage school at a discount (£10
rather than
£26.50), which
were subse-
quently sub-let
at a profit under
the name of
'Imperial Tours.'
Knowing how
concerned Prof
Wakeham, the
deputy rector,
was said to be
over the PG Tips
C t " adverts of late,
I'm sure his opinion was sought on
this issue... Other stories abound
about highly dubious practices as
yet unproven, but repeated by a
wide range of people, and some-
thing tells me that this is not the
last time this office will come
under scrutiny. Anyone
who read IC Reporter will
not recognise this tale of woe.
Distorter said, Growing business
and increasing facilities have led to
rapid expansion and refurbishment
of the Conference Office.' Quite
frankly, if this is the result of 'grow-
ing business1
, the best plan would
seem to be to close the
Conference Office down. The staff
are clearly out of their depth, with
the result that they divert money
from teaching and research rather
than boost these 'core activities.' It
is particularly galling that someone
sees fit to refurbish their office at a
time when some departments, not
least my own, are forced to make
very tough decisions about funding
essential services. This is a strik-
ingly powerful example of the ivory
tower mentality and complete lack
of accountability that pervades
Sherfield.

Courgette and Rice Remoulade
This is a very simple dish which requires
the following ingredients:
*" A large courgette.
«• A small glass of rice - basmati rice
gives a lovely fragrance and can be
bought very cheaply in 20kg bags from
the EastyWest Indian shops that line
most of the street markets described in
the first glorious Burning Water article.
Haggle and you should be able to get
one for £16. Added bonus: you won't
need to go hungry for the rest of the
year.
*• 2 cloves of garlic, crushed and
chopped as usual.
*" Salt, pepper, oil and some chilli
sauce.
First of all, wash and dry the cour-
gette. Then grate it with a cheese grater
(unless you happen to be the only per-
son to possess a courgette grater).
Sprinkle the result with a generous pinch
of salt and leave.
Now cook the rice. There are lots of
ways to do this but mine is the best
(sorry but it happens to be true).
Get a hold of a heavy pan with a
tight fitting lid. If someone's gone and
lost the lid use a plate. Slowly melt some
(say a heaped teaspoonful) butter in the
pan. Pour the glassful of rice in and give
it a stir. Leave the pan over the heat and
gently heat the rice up, stir now and
then. When the rice has become translu-
cent and smelly, pour two glassfuls of
cold water into the pan followed by a
small pinch of salt, bung the lid on and
turn the heat up to max. When the water
starts boiling, turn the heat right down to
minimum or even lower if your cooker's
a bit ancient and can do this sort of thing
(people living in a Tony Christian proper-
ty for instance). After about 10 minutes
the rice will have absorbed all the water.
At this point turn the heat off and leave
the rice to stand for another 10 minutes
while you get on with the courgette.
Plonk your courgette shreds into a
sieve or colander, rinse them under the
tap and then squeeze as much liquid out
of them as possible. Heat up some oil
(olive, 4-5 tablespoons of) over maxi-
mum heat until it's smoking. Throw in
the garlic, give it a whirl and then add
the courgette. Stir energetically. It will
stick a bit but that doesn't really matter,
You don't want it to fry, just to heat
through. At some point add the pepper.
The mixture is cooked after 2-3 minutes.
Now add a few drops of chilli sauce
(yes, of course it's optional) and maybe
some grated parmesan if you have some
lying around, give a final stir and serve
with the rice which by this time will be
perfect.
This dish won't be spoiled if you
decide to add a few other vegetables
like red/green pepper, onion, sweetcorn
etc. They go in with the courgette and
add a pleasant crunchiness to the affair.
Finally, I'd recommend a good bottle
of bitter to go with this.
