Fry is Wilde About the Boy
WILDE
Starring: Stephen Fry, Jude Law,
Vanessa Redgrave, Jennifer Ehle
Director: Brian Gilbert

eleased to coincide with the
100th anniversary of Oscar
Wilde's imprisonment for
homosexuality, Wilde tells the true
tale of his traumatic life. We follow
the literary genius achieving
notoriety with the publication of
"The Picture of Dorian Gray"
through to his falling out with the
establishment over his affair with
Lord Alfred Douglas. It shows how
his wife, Constance Lloyd, coped
with the scandals surrounding her
husband and the Victorian public's
reaction to his famous speech
defending "The Unspoken Love"
felt by an old man to a younger
one.
Much hype has been made of
the fact that this is the role Stephen
Fry was "born to play". Apart from
looking like the great Oscar Wilde
he shares much of his wit, flamboy-
ance and creativity and he clearly
relished the chance to take on the
role. Personally, however, 1 found
this a distraction as I was
constantly aware of how much Fry
was enjoying dressing up in
Victorian clothes and being the
centre of attention. I do not have
anything against actors enjoying
their job, but it is disconcerting
when they are portraying the most
tragic moments of somebody's life.
But this is a minor gripe in what is
overall an interesting and
educational film.
Based on Richard Ellmann's
definitive biography, Wilde focuses
on the author's personal life rather
than his career. Rising star Jude
Law plays Lord Douglas, or
"Bosie", who dominated Wilde and
introduced him to the rent boys
who were to play such a large part
in the writer's last years. There are
some very effective scenes involv-
ing the two although the explicit
nature will undoubtably offend
some of the audience. Fry is at his
best when Wilde is trying to recon-
cile his love for his children with his
passion for Bosie. Unfortunately,
these scenes are accompanied by a
slightly clumsy narrative and
dozens of shots of his two kids
peering longingly out of a window
on a rainy day, but this is the
Stephen Fry. He's loving it.
exception in a very well directed
film.
Overall then this is a rare film,
which is simultaneously funny,
endearing and intelligent. In other
words, it is a perfect tribute to the
man himself. It is just a shame that
it has taken 100 years for
somebody to be brave enough to
make it. D

just Craps
H
ard Eight is not, unfortunately, a double
entendre. It is gambling parlance for the
betting in craps that the dice will come
up again as two fours after it has just happened.
It is a tough bet, unlikely to come up, and is a
metaphor for the lives of the characters in the
film. Apparently.
The story begins with Sydney, a seasoned
old gambler, befriending the out-of-luck John,
for reasons of his own. Sydney teaches him the
way around the seedy casinos of Reno, Nevada,
until John befriends the rough Jimmy (Samuel L.
Jackson, in fine twisted form). Clementine
(Gwyneth Paltrow) works in the bars of the
casinos, as well as the bedrooms, and falls
under the wing of Sydney, only for her and John
to fall in love. A meeting with a client for
Clementine goes wrong, causing the film to turn
towards its violent climax.
The trouble with this film is that this is all
that happens. The film is well directed, with
first-time writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson
more than competent in the technical
department with good use of steadicam and
close-ups. However, since so little happens in
the film the emphasis is on the character
interaction and dialogue to move the story for-
ward. While the acting is very good, the
conversations are stilted and the ponderous
nature of the "quiet moments" means that the
only 'hard eight' the film title could be referring
to is the number of numb buttocks in the
cinema. O
