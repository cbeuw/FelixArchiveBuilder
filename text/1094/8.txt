Find out what's behind our success
Unilever is one of the world's largest and most successful consumer goods businesses. With worldwide
sales exceeding £30 billion - generating profits over £2.8 billion - our famous brands touch the lives of
over half the families in the world. But these brands weren't built by chance. For many years we have
invested heavily in training, developing probably the world's finest graduate training scheme - UCMDS.
In this lies the unique strength of Unilever. Our people. To maintain this success we need to recruit indi-
viduals of the highest calibre. So why don't you check us out by coming to our presentation and meet-
ing some of the people behind our success. You might even know some of them.
