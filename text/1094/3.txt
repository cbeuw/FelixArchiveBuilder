SPORTS HALL
SCUPPERED?
Felix has just learned that planning
permission has not been granted
to 1C for the sports hall develop-
ment. The Estates Department
had intended to construct a huge
six-court gym and other facilities
under the Linstead Hall car park,
but apparently Westminster
Council are unhappy with the loca-
tion. More next week...
SERIOUS INJURIES
IN BAR BRAWL
A member of the Imperial
College Rugby Team was rushed
to hospital after an attack by the
team captain. Apparently, the
captain had been forced to drink
a pint from someone's boot dur-
ing a drinking game, and lost his
temper when team member
'tapped him on the shoulder'. He
was taken to casualty by Anne
Ovens, who happened to be dri-
ving the Women's minibus ser-
vice, and required five stiches.
Rumours are abound of further
altercations on Wednesday
night. Watch this space.
PHYSICS LEAKS
DEADLY FLUORINE
Two cylinders in Room 022 of the
Blackett Laboratory, both contain-
ing fluorine gas, were discovered
to be leaking at 11:45am yester-
day. Security was alerted and
Blackett was evacuated immedi-
ately. Emergency services arrived
on the scene a few moments later
and the fire brigade investigated
the basement of the Blackett
building wearing protective chemi-
cal suits and oxygen equipment.
The police cordoned off the
Queen's Gate side of Prince
Consort Road, up to the
Aeronautics and Chemical
Engineering building, and parts of
the walkway were also closed.
The potentially lethal situation was
cleared up in about an hour. Full
story next week.
NUS vs Dearing
"The biggest show of student anger
for years" is how the NUS describes
the forthcoming London demon-
stration against the proposed stu-
dent fees and abolition of mainte-
nance grants. The protest, which
takes place on the 1st of
November, is hoped to attract
school children, parents and the
public as well as students but is this
all too little, too late?
The proposals were recom-
mended by the Dearing report in
August and, while there have been
fiery words from the NUS, there
has been little action to back them
up. This is in stark contrast to the
Thatcher years where even the
mention of student loans and grant
freezes sparked an explosion of
NUS demonstrations all over the
country, as well as numerous tele-
vision and newspaper appearances
condemning the Conservative gov-
ernment's proposals.
Whether right or wrong, the
new proposals are in a different
league to the loans and grant
freezes of the Eighties. They
remove all pretence of a free high-
er education. Why then such sub-
dued campaigning, and why so late
in the day? Surely a better time for
the NUS to make a storm would
have been at the Labour confer-
ence where the much talked about
rebellion against the proposals
failed to materialise.
Has New Labour molded a
New NUS in its own image? The
higher ranks of the NUS have long
been a stepping stone to a Labour
party career. The Home Secretary,
Jack Straw, was once an NUS pres-
ident, as was Phil Woolas MP and
the General Election held on the
1 st of May brought many more
NUS leaders into the ranks of
Labour MPs.
Under the Conservatives, a
career via the NUS was one against
the establishment, whereas now it
is a career step into the establish-
ment. Have the leaders of the NUS
encountered conflicting interests?
Or are they merely treading care-
fully? Only a demonstration will
tell...

Cassini Payload of Plutonium Safe?
continued from front page
Cassini is the latest of a string of
world-class space missions in
which Imperial College has played
a leading role. The text-book
launch was a welcome confidence
boost to those for whom the spec-
tacular loss of the Cluster mission
in 1996 is still a bitter memory,
when years of work were lost as
the launcher rocket exploded on
lift-off.
The mission provoked contro-
versy over the payload of plutoni-
um used to power its radioisotope
thermal generators which provide
power for the seven year journey.
Environmentalists had expressed
fears for the possible conse-
quences of an explosion on
launch, potentially spreading
deadly radioactive material over a
wide area. However, such con-
cerns were dismissed when the
U.S. government gave the mission
the go-ahead earlier this year.
