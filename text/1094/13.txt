t seems as though the Chart
Information Network (C1N) has
done it again. Following the
decision that Paul Weller's Heavy
Soul could not be counted as a
normal album because it contained
five postcards instead of the
allowed four, the CIN has given a
massive slap on the wrists of two
other bands of late. Hole and The
Pixies have both come out with
new albums of late and both have
been penalised by the CIN. Hole's
My Body The Hand Grenade
comes with a poster that is one
inch bigger than those allowed by
the CIN regulations; whereas,
since the Pixies have released
some albums with an extra 21-
track CD, the CIN has deemed
them to be different albums.
Basically, this has resulted in both
albums charting much lower than
they should have done. Do the
words petty and pointless spring
to mind? I think so.
Professor Crispin Sartwell of a
University in America has come up
with the formula for success, liter-
ally. His first law states that "..the
quality of a rock band is inversely
proportional to its pretentious-
ness. A band's pretentiousness is
expressed as a ratio of artistic
ambition to artistic accomplish-
ment." Using this extremely
steady scientific basis, he con-
cludes that the best band ever has
been The Rolling Stones because
they stuck to their blues roots at all
times. Bruce Springstein and U2
were said to be able to " purvey
simple tunes with an elaborateness
reserved for Wagnerian opera."
The Ramones also featured on his
scale at 'excellent'. Seems strange
that Oasis did not feature on his
scale at all... their pretentiousness
ratio would be well in to the thou-
sands at least. H
And now, the marking scheme...

with the ticket-collectors outside to
try and determine which guest list
we were actually on, we could hear
the strains of Medication whenever
the inner doors were opened.
Tracks from Pure Phase and Laser
Guided Melodies criss-crossed
each other effortlessly but we were
still outside. Finally we were given
someone else's tickets and when
we made it into the main hall, we
were over half an hour late.
The light came from the back of
the stage like some sort of huge,
unceasing wave that engulfed the
whole arena. Spotlights occasion-
ally appeared but they never rested
upon any of the performers;
instead they shot into the crowds
and would slice through them peri-
odically. Throughout the whole
spectacle, Jason Pierce and com-
pany never even seemed to flinch.
All that could be seen of them were
a few silhouettes that seemed to
be playing instruments and from
whom was coming a gentle and
sometimes heavenly sound.
Indeed the only people really visi-
ble on stage were the gospel choir
that were at the back and the

strings and brass sections that were
used to give a massive kick to each
of the tracks.
A track that sticks in my mind
from the night is the raucous Come
Together which is from their last
album Ladies and Gentlemen We
Are Floating In Space. On this track
the tempo picked up and the
organs got raunchy as the singing
got more and more desperate.
This lead to a climax only usually
seen in huge stadium rock gigs.
The finale consisted of about seven
or eight minutes of random music
from everyone on stage which was
accompanied by a lighting operator
on speed. Throughout the whole
thing, the momentum grew and
grew and just when you would
think it was coming to an end, it
would carry on and on and on....
There was no encore on the
night and, in my opinion, it was a
good job. They could not have
topped the show that they had just
given. CI
