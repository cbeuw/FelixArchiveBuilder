ELBOWS? ARSES?
D O THEY KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE?
Once again, we're leading with bad
news and stories of yet more
incompetence, inefficiency and
mismanagement. Good news isn't
news, they say, but surely the regu-
larity with which some part of lC's
administration goes bottom-up
must be worthy of some type of
record.
Failing to bring in money from
the Fashion Week deal is totally rep-
rehensible. As bad, in my mind, as
wasting or even stealing funds
already procured - money really
owned by the researchers and stu-
dents of the College, and only
entrusted to the officers of Sherfield
so they can manage it wisely.
The problem is only com-
pounded by the dense layers of
secrecy surrounding practices and
finance. Accounts are almost
impossible to obtain, despite the
fact that the majority of the money
is public sector income. Even the
minutes of the Management and
Planning committee (MPG) - a

group that makes far-reaching
decisions on the development of
the University - are not in the pub-
lic domain.
IC should aim to be an open
and representative organisation
(sound familiar?) and submit to a
proper scheme of quality control.
The reason why they do not do this
is at least clear; go public and that
precious reputation would go
straight down the pan.
ANY OLD IRON?
Last year, during the refurbishment
of dBs, the heating pipes for the
Print Shop and part of the Felix
office were cut, adding 'freezing' to
the list of problems experienced
while working there (the others are
dampness, darkness, lack of ven-
tiallation and lack of space). No,
they couldn't fix the pipes, but they
were generous enough to provide
us with a tiny fan heater. Imagine
my surprise when, on Monday,
four enormous electric radiators
appeared in the office - far too big
to be useful.

We reported that an intruder had
his arm broken in a struggle with

slipped.
