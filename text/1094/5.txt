FOOTIE THANKS
Dear Felix,
We are writing to thank every-
one who helped with this sum-
mer's successful football club tour
to Prague. We are especially grate-
ful to the Union and the ACC for
their support and financial contri-
bution, the Harlington Trust, and
Phil Siverns for being Tour Captain.
With England and Scotland now
having qualified for France '98
hopefully next year's proposed tour
to the World Cup will be as enjoy-
able and worthwhile.
Thanks again
Stuart Cook, Paul Smith; Tour
Organisers
DRUNK THANKS
Sir,
I'm writing to express my sin-
cere thanks to a couple who took
me home last Friday. 1 was
extremely drunk and not very well
at all. What possessed them to
peel me off the pavement and look
after me, when I've never met them
before I do not know. The Good
Samaritan is alive and well and liv-
ing in the body of these two third
years, who are possibly called Ben
and something beginning with an
'M'. 1 owe them the price of a bus
fare, a great deal of patience and
one of Esther Rantzen's gold heart
from front page
it reminded her of a "party atmos-
phere."
The shows were scheduled to
take place in the daytime between
9:00am and 6:00pm but were reg-
ularly delayed by half an hour. At
times, the noise disturbance would
have been taking place until
6:45pm in the evening causing
more disturbances to those living in
and around the vicinity of the
College.
Mr Gillett said that "it was hard
to establish an acceptable sound
level because it depended on a
number of factors including the
length of the music and its loath-
someness to the ear".
Problems were aslo encoun-
tered in the organisation of the
things. 1 believe I didn't thank them
at the time, but my heart brims
with gratitude now, as I'm sure had
they not been so persuasive I'd
still be collapsed in a heap on
Queensgate. I should also like to
thank Smita who put me on the
minibus, which I then promptly got
out of, in the belief that the Union
would not appreciate it if I sick in
their vehicle (Neither 1 imagine
would my fellow travellers). I hope
these shining stars of humanity
have a long and happy life.
I should also like to add at this
point that I NEVER normally behave
like this.
Yours,
Elaine Kellow
Extremely embarassed to sign her
name, but able to take the conse-
quences of her actions.
PostScript: Would it be possible to
get Ms. Kelly Green as a columnist?
Her views spark a lot of interesting
debate. I should love to hear her
opinions on other prickly subjects.
Her style of ignoring the adage that
'once you start personally insulting
the opposition you've lost the argu-
ment1
is an interesting read.
I should love to retort to her
opinions, but (a) Everybody did it in
show. Although the deal was struck
over a year ago, the actual planning
of the event did not take place until
the last minute. The security dept
were only notified about the event
three weeks before it was staged,
not giving them enough time to re-
roster their staff adding extra prob-
lems and cost to the overall show.
The total bill charged by College
is estimated to be around £26,700,
though many additional costs were
not accounted for. If the show
takes place again next year,
London Fashion Week may have to
pay several times more than this
year's bill.

the last Felix and (b) I should think
after the first portion of this letter
no one would take my opinions
seriously.
COLOURBLIND?
Dear Felix
I am looking for colour defec-
tive volunteers to take part in a
colour naming experiment.
If you are colour defective or
think you may have a problem with
your colour vision and would be
interested in taking part in these
experiments please contact me on
47674 / 47672 or e-mail
sr.jones@ic.ac.uk. for further infor-
mation.
The experiment takes about
two hours to perform in full, but
can be split into sessions if pre-
ferred.
Yours Hopefully
Jo Bristow
