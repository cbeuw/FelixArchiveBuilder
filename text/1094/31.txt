An interview with
Roy Home*..
Roy is a Mechanical Engineering graduate from 1995, who now
works for Van Den Bergh's foods as a project manager. He
joined Unilever as a technical trainee - he felt that the people
from Unilever were 'very switched on and motivated' and had
been drawn to a technical management career through his
earlier work experience. The interview went a bit like this...
What are the best bits of your job?
Leading change (mostly and hopefully for the better) and
learning all the time.
And the worst bits?
The traditional end of industrial relations.
What have been the highlights?
Re-engineering a factory in both technology and structure and
sticking around to make it work.
Where do you see yourself in five years time?
Building a big new manufacturing plant.
What is the most exciting place you have been to (connected
to work)?
The highlands of Kenya.
What car do you drive?
Golf GTI.
Do you get a good salary?
I scrape by
What do you remember about Imperial College?
Three Kings Pub, brainy people, way too much work, really
nasty exams.
Why did you choose Unilever?
Possibility of working overseas, good starting salary, offered
endless career options, liked their ice creams.
What advice can you give to today's undergraduate?
Don't plan too hard - go for what you think you will enjoy -
be honest and be prepared to change direction if necessary.
UNILEVER TRIATHLON
It's 11am on a very cold morning
and I'm standing in the middle of a
field, in my swimming trunks.... in
Holland!
No, I'm not doing some silly rag
stunt, I left college a couple of years
ago. The first time I heard about the
annual Unilever triathlon was at
least six months ago, the comfort of
"plenty of time for training" was
enough to persuade me. Well, I'm
here and, needless to say, the
"comfort of having done lots of
training" is not. Maybe I shouldn't
have had those beers last night as
well. I'm amongst a crowd of
people from the ten or so other U K
Unilever companies, a lot of friends
that I've picked up since my time in
Unilever, even a couple that I went
to Imperial with. Luckily I'm
cheating in the triathlon and doing
the team event - one discipline
each - seeing as I'm wearing
swimming trunks there's no way I
can change to the bike ride.
B A N G ! ! !
I jump into the water with the
other ten people in my lane, fifty
metres each length, ten lengths to
go (and this is the shortest race
available, the full triathlon is eight
times bigger). Ten lengths happen
fairly quickly - though not quickly
enough for the rest of my team!
I'm not exactly first, but not
exactly last, but the bikes are away
and I can relax, free beer in the bar
all evening then a night on the
town in Utrecht...
Not exactly a typical working
day at Unilever, but by no means
unfamiliar. Most of my friends and
colleagues participate regularly in
sporting, social and community
events, from fun runs to the Flora
(another Unilever product)
London Marathon which our
Chairman, along with many
employees, enjoyed participating
in earlier this year. I don't think I
need to explain the seamless
transition of my social life from
Imperial to a career with Unilever.
How sport can get you a job
Do you arrange fixture after
fixture? Organise the team to be
there on time and playing the right
position? Coach new players to be
part of a successful team? Then
you could be making the path
towards that job you really want.
In fact, an active role in any extra
curricular activity could put you in
front of the other candidates.
If you can identify which skills
your role has helped you develop
and which qualities you have that
allow you to do the job well, then
your C V is halfway to being
written.
Think about these ones...
Leadership
Strategic and as a spokesperson.
Organisational skills
(1) ££ M O N E Y ££ - controlling
the finances - so you can have new
kit and still afford the end of year
bash. (Perhaps you initiated some
form of sponsorship?)
(2) Getting all of the fixtures
arranged, teams organised and
transport that gets you all there
and back.
(3) Foreign tour planning is a
task of arranging fixtures,
overcoming language barriers,
accommodation, travel and
reciprocal events.
Teamworking
New recruits every year stretch
your abilities to pull together a
successful team.
Communication Skills
How do you make sure the
whole team knows the location,
gameplan and pub to meet in.
Beach sports backed by
Unilever brands
Several up-and-coming beach
sports have been sponsored by
Unilever brands in Europe over the
summer.
In the UK, Elida Faberge's Salon
Selectives shampoo sponsored the
British Beach Volleyball Open
Championships. After contests on
four beaches dotted around the
UK, the finals were held on a
specially constructed beach in
London's Battersea Park.
In Germany, a crowd of 16,000
fans flooded onto a beach near
Lubeck to see the finals of the
National Beach Volleyball
MasterSeries Championships, co-
sponsored by Liptonice, the tea-
based beverage. Beach volleyball
is popular in Germany and its
introduction at the Olympic
Games in Atlanta last year has
marked its arrival on the world
stage. The series attracted 50,000
spectators and the finals received
two hours of national television
coverage.
Also in Germany, Langnese,
Unilever's German ice cream
brand, together with Kodak,
brought the action-packed amateur
sand football to Europe for the first
time, with tournaments in five
cities, watched by more than
100,000 people. Some 300
amateur and four professional
teams took part in the tour which
attracted good coverage on
German television.
Flora's great day out
Blue skies and perfect conditions
cheered on the 29,000 runners in
the 1997 Flora London Marathon
last April.
Making the Marathon an extra
special event for Unilever this year
was the participation of our
Chairman, Niall Fitzgerald. He
raised over £250,000 for Save the
Children after completing the
course in 4 hours 46 minutes -
After the race, Niall said: 'I
thought I was doing quite well
until I was overtaken by an
octopus!' Congratulations to him
and all the other Unilever
competitors this year. Unilever's
sponsorship of this event allowed
over £10 million to be raised for
various charities.
