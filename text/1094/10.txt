Drapes, lights and
strange geometric
lights hang from the
ceiling at the
Freshers' Ball.
Millions scrabble for the
freebies on offer at the
Freshers' Fair. ICU's many
clubs and societies put on a
warm welcome to both new
and old students.
\
Nice to see that IC students are remaining
true to our history of sobreity and good
conduct...
Is it a spaceship? A Pink Floyd gig?
No! Its the front of the Union,
wonderfully decorated. Joy!
