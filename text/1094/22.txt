ICS WALKERS MAY HAVE
PUT A FOOT IN IT BUT
THE FELLWANDERS KEEP
O N TRIPPING...
In June, nine Fellwanderers set off
on what proved to be our most
exciting trip to date, for reasons
which were not wholly anticipated.
At the end of term we all jetted off
to Southern France for a fortnight
of trekking and camping in the
rugged Pyrenees, attempting to
follow some of the GRIO long-dis-
tance path.
The first week was warm and
sunny, and started with an arduous
climb up to 7,500ft, leaving civili-
sation behind completely. We
walked for hours under clear blue
skies through alpine meadows,
past clear blue lakes, and over
boulder-strewn wastes, where
snow still lay in patches. Our
Wilderness Campsite under the Pic
de Bastan afforded particularly
memorable views.
After a few days, we trans-
ferred to Gavarnie, the starting
point for the next major section of
our trek. We spent a couple of
days here, admiring the magnifi-
cent Cirque de Gavarnie, a vast
natural amphitheatre bounded by
sheer rockfaces 4,500ft high.
Meltwater from glaciers forms the
Grande Cascade, one of Europe's
highest
waterfalls, which we discov-
ered was rather wet at close quar-
ters.
By Saturday the weather was
beginning to deteriorate, with the
wind getting up and the tempera-
ture dropping. We decided to get
on the move again, heading up
into the mountains towards
Vignemale. On the way we
encountered desolate valleys with
eagles circling around, no
doubt eyeing up the marmots.
During the afternoon however,
of improving, and it began to look
as if we may be holed up there for
some time. But the lack of heating
and the trips through the snow to
the refuge's single outside toilet
did little to lower our morale, and
dwindling food supplies did not
things started to deviate some-
what from our plans. As we
climbed higher, the drizzle turned
to rain, which turned to snow,
which turned to lots of snow,
about two feet of it by the end of
the day. But we pressed on hero-
ically, still wearing our shorts, as
we are no strangers to these con-
ditions. (They were just a little
unexpected in the South of France
at the end of June, that's all.) The
warden at the mountain refuge we
came to was more than slightly
surprised to see us arrive thus
attired, and did not turn out to be
the hospitable host we had been
hoping for. But after a little negoti-
ation, he did actually let us stay in
the refuge rather than in some
nearby caves. The Z0 or so other
guests didn't seem to mind too
much, and one of them even
translated the warden's jokes
about us.
The weather showed no signs
stop us making a fine lentil stew on
the second night.
By Monday morning, the war-
den had been in radio contact with
the local authorities, who had
decided that the seriousness of
our situation was enough to war-
rant a full-
scale airlift. He was apparently
not slow to spot the opportunity
for publicity: the rescue helicopter
brought up several journalists and
TV crews during the evacuation.
'Des Anglais en shorts' was obvi-
ously a major news event, and was
featured on the main national TV
news that evening. Various mem-
bers' legs achieved their 15 sec-
onds of fame while Oily proudly
explained that such clothing was
'normal en Angleterre'. Our free
helicopter ride was most definitely
a highlight of the trip, and took us
over some very impressive snow-
capped scenery.
In the second week, we could
not hope to match this for excite-
ment, especially as it turned out to
be the wettest week since the
French Revolution. As the rain beat
down
on our tents, the thermal baths
at Cauterets began to sound more
and more appealing. However, we
decided to give them a wide berth
when we discovered that you
needed a prescription to get in.
Having thus exhausted the town's
potential for entertainment, we
headed up the river to Pont
d'Espagne, where the waterfalls
were made all the more impressive
by the downpours. From here,
some of us attempted a quick
excursion over the mountains into
Spain. But at the first sight of a
snowflake we turned tail and fled;
we may be mad but we're not
stupid.
The next day we returned to
Cauterets where we made a sump-
tuous 19-course meal to celebrate
our survival. Then it was back to
London, home, dry and thoroughly
exhausted. If you would like a
piece of the action, come along to
one of our regular lunchtime meet-
ings (see diary).
