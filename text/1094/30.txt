An interview with Iain Ferguson
Chairman of Birds Eye Wall's and ex-technical trainee
How important is technology in
Unilever?
The importance of technology in
Unilever is very much dependent
on the products of the future - will
they be complex or simple? I
believe they will become more
complex with time and
consequently the technology will
also become more complex. We
are also likely to continue the
relentless drive towards higher and
higher productivity. These two
effects combined will increase the
scale of our factories. The focus on
the removal of excess stock is also
important - manufacturing is
becoming much closer to sales and
the consumer. Information systems
are less factory focussed and stand
alone moving towards an
integrated supply chain approach.
Ideally as a consumer removes a
packet off a shelf in the
supermarket, an action is triggered
in the factory.
The other issue is that of third
party manufacture. In the current
mixed economy Unilever
produces 75-80% of its own
brands. This is unlikely to change.
But there will be more and more
strategic partnerships with third
party manufacturers. This will
create a new role of intelligent
customer - looking at the technical
capability and managing the
technical transfer between
companies. Unilever is not likely
to become a Benetton
outsourcing all its production.
Unilever makes money from its
operations - making more this way
than through third party supply.
The major changes in recent
years in terms of operating have
been the team working and total
productive maintenance
approaches. Though Unilever is
still in the early stages of the
implementation of these practices
compared to the Far East and to
some extent, the USA, it is an
emphasis Unilever will continue;
removing the operating /
maintenance barriers in our
operations.
What could a graduate expect in
a technical career at Unilever?
It is likely to be factory based.
Unilever needs to continue to
develop its factory management
expertise. Increasingly, the role
will reflect the closer integration
with the business through the
supply chain. As mentioned
before, the intelligent customer
role in terms of production and
services will also be an important
area.
Why should a graduate join
Unilever?
As well as the excellent training
there are many reasons to join
Unilever. We can provide a broad
based career - once a platform has
been established in the company, it
is possible to move to different
areas of the business. There is
no obligation to stay in
enginering.
Unilever is full of interesting
technology - its uses of IT,
packaging machinery, logistics,
technology application. It can
be difficult to portray the
challenge and excitement that
a technical career with an
F M C G company provides
compared to something like
marketing - but three or four
years into your career - your
experiences will have been
much more diverse and
exciting than those from a more
traditional 'engineering'
industry. Manufacturing is •
much more interesting than a
power station - how can bits of
electricity down a cable be exciting?
In the longer term there is the
potential to move away from your
home country; that tends to happen
at the right time for the person
rather than straight away. Unilever
believe that it is important to build
up your expertise and network
group in your company first before
undertaking an overseas
assignment. Then when you do go
abroad you have a reason to be
there and a network to back you
up.
What is Unilever's future in the
next five years?
Concentrating on the consumers'
needs, becoming even better at
From technical beginnings it is
possible to follow a general business
career path - Iain himself and
several group presidents are living
proof of this.

Some words of advice:-
• Be clear about what you want
to do.
• Be clear of your choice
between traditional engineering
and a manufacturing environment.
Clarity is the key.
• Take every opportunity to
visit plants and factories to see the
industries and have some hands-
on understanding.
• Be honest - man-
management - is it important to
you? If so then the factory is
probably the right direction, if not,
choose something like logistics
where it is less important.

Professor Dominic Tildesley is a physical chemist at
Imperial College and he also works for Unilever. As
an advisor on simulation and modelling, he gets
involved with many aspects of the Unilever
business.
Unipath—
innovation in
women's health
Unipath, part of Unilever's Home
and Personal Care Europe business
group, are world leaders in the
field of women's health. It is the
company that created one-step
pregnancy testing in the mid-
1980's with Clearblue Onestep,
revolutionising the market and
setting a new standard for the
industry. This one-step technology
has made home pregnancy testing
user-friendly, reliable and
accurate.
Using monoclonal antibodies,
Unipath developed and patented
rapid assay technology, which now
forms the basis of all the current
products. Chief among these is
PERSONA, the first method of
contraception to monitor a
women's hormones, identifying
the days of her cycle when she is
free to make love without using
contraceptives.
In developing PERSONA,
Unipath has forged two key
technological advances. First, it
has used its patented technology to
produce the first home-use dual
immunoassay, capable of detecting
two hormones simultaneously.
Second, using advances in
microelectronics, it has developed
a state-of-the-art computerised
Monitor that is capable of reading
the PERSONA Test Sticks and
uses a sophisticated algorithm to
determine a woman's fertility
status.
In the future, Unipath will
respond first to women's needs,
creating the products that will lead
women's health into the new
millennium.
Ice cream structures and
crystalline bridges between
detergent particles are just two of
the areas in which has collaborated
with the Unilever modelling team.
He says that there are some
differences between pure research
and working with industry: "In
academic work we tend to change
goals. If you come up against a
brick wall, you don't stand there
and admire it, you move across
and tackle a slightly different
problem. That's not true in
Unilever. If you come up against a
brick wall there, you often have no
choice but to tackle it head-on. You
have to find some approximate
method of doing it, which is very
difficult."
He also confesses to being
astonished at the speed with which
problems can be addressed in the
industrial environment.
