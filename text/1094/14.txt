T H E PIXIES
Death To The Pixies (The Best of the Pixies: 1987 - 1991) • • • •
The Pixies: you
only find these
people at the bot-
tom of your gar-
den, supposedly.
|Hj It is said of the Velvet
Underground that not
many people bought
! their record but every-
one who did started a band. The
same has been said of the Pixies.
The lead singer was a handsome,
fresh faced, blonde haired kid who
alternately sang in Spanish and
then, without warning, started to
yell as if a UFO had just flown off
with his sister and the lead guitarist
made pretty much every conceiv-
able noise except the one you were
expecting. The rhythm section
seemed perfectly normal. The
drummer, with more than his fair
share of stick twirling, laid down a
foundation like a pile driver and
connected like a Siamese twin with
the bass player who, in a decidedly
unrock like manner, had a smile
that could knock a man down.
Charles Thompson (later to be
known as Black Francis), Kim Deal,
joey Santiago and David Lovering
slammed onto the scene in
September 1987 with their debut
album Come On Pilgrim (taken
from the lyrics of Levitate Me),
surfing in on the back of the surf-
ing/punk/street culture sound that
was beginning to die out. When
they left to go their own separate
ways in the early nineties they
paved the way for bands like
Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins,
Green Day and Weezer and indeed
as Smells Like Teen Spirit was ram-
paging up the charts the Seattle
Trio remarked that it sounded for
all the world like a Pixie's song.
Some say that, that was the day
that counterculture started to die.
Death to the Pixies storms off
with the instrumental Cecilia Ann,
continues with the Elastica-esque
Planet of Sound and continues with
Here comes your Man, which you
could swear that you'd heard
before, through Debaser , Holiday
Song and finishing seventeen songs
later with the lilting Monkey Gone
to Heaven.
If you like the Pixies, get this
album. If you like proper indie then
you'll recognise all the albums
you've ever heard in here so get it
to complete your musical timeline.
If you are into the rock/ indie/
generic guitar bands scene then get
this album to give your collection
some credibility and if you're into
dance then fuck off, you'll probably
hate it although you should give it a
listen just in case you do like it.
I would like to point out that I
do not favour people who listen to
indie over those who prefer dance/
hip hop/ techno/ thrash/ industrial/
jungle/ etc etc. I was merely indi-
cating that if you listen almost
exclusively to Sash, LT] Bukem et al
then you are unlikely to like this
particular. CI

This is Stereolab.
(Sorry, we couldn't
think of a better
caption.)
i Stereolab always seem to have done their
] own thing, and revelled in being anti-estab-
j lishment in terms of the music scene. Well,
l they have survived through the last few
years, and have re-surfaced again with another semi-
pop record.
On initial listen of the album, the songs have a very
similar sound to them that makes them as easy to dis-
tinguish as a shivering penguin on a crowded penguin
populated rocky isle in the middle of the Antarctic. If you
allow the album a chance to drift into your subconscious
the songs will start to slowly edge their way into your
thoughts. Tracks like Miss Modular with its excellent
basslines and upbeat mellowness, as opposed to the
mainly downbeat type that prevails throughout, have a
certain catchiness about them that insinuates itself under
your skin. The French influenced rhythms are blatantly
apparent as well as some extremely off the beat affairs,
with a bit of post trip hop experimentation thrown in for
reassurance that they're keeping up with the times.
Stereolab make good use of strings and brass parts to
create elegant songs while still remaining mildly funk
rhythmically. On the third track, The Flower Called
Nowhere, they even make use of a harpsichord synthe-
sised sound that blends in with their music style just as
well as if it was being used for an old Mozart number.
Overall it is probably an acquired taste, but it also
has the potential to appeal to a wider audience. CI

Risotto * *
T
here aren't enough hours in
the week. Things not of
immediate importance seem
to get pushed back and back like
jetsam on a dirty tidal bore of half-
finished jobs and chaotic stress.
Thus, it seemed the perfect solution
to review this album in my sleep.
The first morning I forgot about
it entirely, not recalling the experi-
ment until 1 returned to my room
that evening and stood on the CD
cover. The second time, 1 took
more care, setting the timer to
trigger just as 1 would be entering
beta-wave sleep. Nothing.
So its back to the conventional
conscious method, and now what
went wrong. It's a professional
album, but lacking - it doesn't take
you anywhere as a good ambient-
techo track should. There's no sur-
prises, no 'noises' cool enough to
turn your head, and even when
cranked up it fails to get apparently
normal people wiggling their back-
sides and saying "this is a storming
track". Better luck next time. CI
