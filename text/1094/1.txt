Fashion Week
Outrage
Many people were left angry and
upset after IC played host to part
of London Fashion Week. The
level of noise caused by the fashion
shows was generally considered to
be unacceptably loud for a working
environment.
After initial sound tests by engi-
neers in the marquee on the
Queen's Lawn created a distur-
bance, Ian Gillett (IC's Safety
Officer) was called in to monitor
the noise level of the music used.
Mr Gillett worked with the sound
engineers to maintain a level of
95dB inside the tent, equivalent to
that heard at a pop concert, and
also recorded levels of 70-75dB
outside the tent would be the noise
made if Cromwell Road was re-
directed through the Queen's
Lawn. Mr Gillett also recorded the
sound level in a library conference
room when a show was taking
place and found it to be 58dB
which is comparable to the noise
made be in normal conversation.
During the week the College
Secretary, Tony Mitchenson,
received 5 official complaints from
people getting increasingly irritat-
ed by the constant noise. Felix was
told that the sound was "horren-
dous and awful" from several peo-
ple working on the third level of the
Sherfield building. The Student
Records Office, which was already
inundated with work due to the
forthcoming freshers, also said that
they were unable to concentrate.
One assistant who came in early
said that the noise was so bad that
"...the walls and the floor were
actually vibrating from the noise",
five of the assistants became so
frustrated that they shouted "Shut
up!" in unison out of their window
and secretaries in other offices
complained of having headaches at
the end of the day. However, some
of those in the Sherfield building
did not mind the noise. One secre-
tary actually enjoyed the music,

Cassini Survives
IC's Space Physics Croup heaved
a sigh of relief today as the Titan
rocket carrying the Cassini-
Huygens mission to Saturn
blasted off from Cape
Canaveral. Cassini was due to
launch on Monday but was delayed
at the last minute due to adverse
weather conditions.
The mission, which is a collabo-
ration between the major space
agencies and several European uni-
versities, consists of an orbiter,
Cassini, carrying eighteen instru-
ments to investigate the mysteries
of the Saturn system, and a probe,
Huygens, which will land on the
surface of Saturn's most interesting
moon, Titan. The project was start-
ed seven years ago and has cost
over Â£500 million pounds to devel-
op. Scientists expect Cassini's
imaging systems to relay pictures
of Saturn of unprecedented quality,
surpassing those taken by the
Galileo or Voyager probes.
Imperial College is the Principal
Investigator Institution for the
"MAG" magnetometry experiment
aboard Cassini. The Space Physics
Group of Imperial College, led by
Professor David Southwood, was
responsible for the development
and construction of the magne-
tometer instruments designed to
investigate the magnetic field of
Saturn and interactions between
the planet, its rings and its
satellites.
The launch, relayed live to a TV
monitor in the Physics building, was
described by Andre Balogh of the
Space Physics group as mankind's
"last chance" of visiting the ringed
planet during our lifetimes. The
huge expense of visits to the outer
planets means that this mission is
likely to be the last of its kind.

The new Biomedical Sciences
Building is revealing itself this
week as exterior work ends and
the scaffolding comes down. It
will house the Biology depart-
ment and half of Imperial's
medical students from next
year. Designed by Sir Norman
Foster, it features a massive
central atrium and makes full
use of the limited natural light.
The best rooms are reserved for
meeting and social spaces and
professors' offices.
