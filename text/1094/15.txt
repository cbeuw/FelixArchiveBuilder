Here. Artists from both sides of the
Atlantic are brought together as
well as artists from different gener-
ations. Bobby Darin's Beyond The
Sea. full of brass band pomposity
sits snugly in with Underworld's
songs on here, including golden
oldies like Elvis Presley's Always On
romace). The pinacle of the album
has to be Faithless' gospel sound-
ing Where Has A// The Love Cone.

L
istening to the soundtrack
of a film that you have not
seen is always an interest-
ing experience. The songs that a
director chooses to complement
a film are vitally important to the
dynamics and feel.
Several different approaches
will often work for one scene, but
choosing the best one is difficult
at the best of times and so it is
quite difficult to criticise any indi-
vidual songs because they may
have been the best songs for the
part of the film in which they were
used. With Face, Antonia Bird has
come up with a film about a heist
gone wrong that is set in the heart
of London's gangland community.
The songs on this soundtrack,
then, should reflect that atmos-
phere and social condition.
Fortunately, they do.
We start with Paul Weller
and his acoustic guitar which is
followed, rather surprisingly, by
a sub-jungle track from Alex
Reece with Deborah Anderson
on vocals. This is fairly repre-
sentative of most of the album
where house and dance go
head-to-head with acoustic bal-
lads and guitar-driven cuts. A
fairly wide range of music is,
therefore, covered and this
makes for a good general com-
pilation album. There's also a
good selection of names on the
album; Fluke, The Longpigs,
Gene, Billy Bragg and Death In
Vegas all contribute. The
strangest thing, perhaps, is that
this film about London and a
soundtrack that reeks of London
through and through ends on a
song by Puressence, a very
northern band. H

SINGLES
Smog - Ex - Con
1 know it is probably sacrilege to utter any bad
words against Smog, the regular faves of a cer-
tain music newspaper, but I'm sorry, this is
bland, boring and tiresome.
Primal Scream - Burning Wheel
Kowalski has the hard edged immediate impact
effect that expresses the Scream's pioneering
attitude. Burning Wheel instead drifts you along
into an ethereal atmospheric bass heavy zone
and is undoubtedly the number one track off
Vanishing Point.
Hurricane #1 - Step Into My World The
Perfecto Mixes
The amazing debut single from Andy Bell's new
post Ride outfit has been masterfully remixed.
Don't think they're ripping you off by releasing
it again after just a few months. It totally
deserves to be.
2K - ***k the Millenium
What Time Is Love was originally recorded in
1988 and has now been remixed to produce a
real kick arse track, appropriately released just
days after the start of the construction for the
millenium dome.
T H E E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Violet - Sleepwwalking
Depressing lyrics, meaningful lyrics. Combining
the sounds and style of Suede and Puressence,
while at the same time coming across as
unique. Managing to pull it off and still include a
brilliant Radiohead - esque ending to crown it all
off. You may leap to conclusions about jumping
onto the bandwagon of the 'new grave' scene
just as I did. However I would forgive them this
time because it is a cracking track.
Imogen Heap - Getting Scared
It seems as though Beth Orton has a fan, it was
only a matter of time I suppose. This track is
awash with emotional vocals and oppressive
beats, a sure sign that Imogen is from the Beth
Orton stable of singer-songwriters. Listenable
but nothing special.
The Cure - Wrong Number
It sounds uncannily similar to any of Jesus Jones'
tracks, with its dance beats underlaying the gui-
tar melody approach. However they have the
lyrics close to home, with lines like, 'I'm green
and tangerine'. Who else would write that I ask
you?
Mover - Move Over
Haven't we been inundated enough with Beatles
wannabes. Well if you're not already sick of
them all by now, here is another band who have
wriiten a drab, unoriginal pile of Cast type
garbage, d
