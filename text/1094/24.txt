A mixed bag for footie
Results
IC I v GOLDSMITHS I
The British University Sports
Association is, well, BUSA. And in
October nobody really cares
about BUSA. That isn't strictly true,
of course. We do care. And we
hate losing. But on the basis of the
second half 3-1 to Goldies was
probably a fair result in theend,
even though we outplayed them in
IC IV v HOLLOWAY IV
The last time the fourths played
the champagne flowed freely
after the game to celebrate our
championship win.
Six months later the harsh real-
ity of IC football returned. For the
first twenty minutes "ole football"
produced a deserved one goal lead
to the fourths, Simon "Tin-Tin"
the first half in which new boy
Richard Pratt looked like he had
seen The Duke of Prague awakened
down our right hand side. Pratt was
not the only newcomer as German
Shana, Ricky Gibson, Nak T., Phil
Parker and Laurent also made their
1 st Team debuts, the latter capping
a fine I st half performance by set-
ting up Amo's egualiser. One of the
more experienced players, Donal
Hutton scoring a wonder-goal by
beating four Holloway players then
firing past the keeper.
A demoralising equaliser just
before half-time set up Holloway
for their four-goal blitz in the sec-
ond-half, helped to a great extent
by poor 'keeping, as is typical, by
the IC 'keeper. Enough said.
A wonder shot by Chris from 30
yards and then a 20 yard free kick
Rugby boys lose lots
ICRFC III v
St BARTS
Unfortunately after much pre-
match practise, we were told
that St Bart's had managed to
hospitalise four of their players
by crashing a car. They declared
ICRFC I v St BARTS
As they always say, the best side
LOST! The scoreline flattered
Barts bu IC couldn't convert pos-
session and territory into points.
A very committed first game by all.
An excellent try scored in the cor-
ner by Trefer "Telfer" Beynon after
excellent play by the forwards to
suck in their backs. Man of the
ICRFC II v BARTS II
1CRFC 2nds demonstrated well that
what they lack in team play they
more than make up for in individual
skills. Aside from a miserable first
15 minutes when we were conced-
ed an unlucky try and drop goal we
put Barts 2nd under constant pres-
sure. It wasn't helped by the ref.
having a whistle phobia.
Once the team got their arses in
the match to us, allowing us to
play our own friendly.
We hope to be able to wel-
come more players at Monday
training (meet Beit Quad 6:15 pm)
so that we can establish an extra
XV. Players of all abilities are
encouraged to come along.
ICRFC III v St Bart's Hospital
match Martin "Buffy" Buttenshaw
was everywhere and yes (!) Rich
"Mongol" Lloyd started fighting.
Forwards dominated and
backs gelled very well, we just
need to cross that white line. The
freshers' committment was out-
standing. Alistair "I'm not a
Welshman" Jeffery's kicking kept
us in touch throughout the game.
ICRFC I 16-14 Barts Hospital
gear we put Barts under perma-
nent pressure and were exception-
ally unlucky not to score. With
backs and forwards crashing to
within millimetres of the line one
mistake would see us being driven
back down the pitch.
With some superb individual skills
all it takes is some training and we
will soon be playing some superb
rugby.
ICRFC II 0 - 10 BARTS II
Keane, was beaten by a 40 yard
shot (OK, it was deflected) in the
1 st half, while captain Psycho man-
aged not to kill anyone. As long as
we start our usual winning run ear-
lier than last year the post-match
conclusion must be that the firsts
will win the ULU premier league
this year.
IC Ists 1 - 3 Goldsmiths Ists
from Ryan beating the flapping
'keeper put a deserved respectable
gloss on the score-line.
Notable performances by
Captain Swift, Edd, Ryan and the
rest of the team, until tiredness set
in, bodes well for the future.

Shooters look
to new era
Imperial College Rifle and Pistol
Club can trace its history back to
1859 when it was formed as part
of the patriotic movement which
took up marksmanship to
counter the threat from
Napoleon III of France. It was
then called the Finsbury Rifles,
named after the City and Guilds
Fnsbury Technical College, now
one of the Constituent College
Unions.
After the recent changes in law
which prohibit the possession of
"small firearms" (pistols to you and
me) we are having to change the
emphasis on what we do. We have
a purpose built range in the Sports
Centre which is certified for .22
rifle from the standing, kneeling or
prone positions and for low power
centrefire rifle from the standing
and kneeling positions. We also do
air rifle and pistol shooting and
some archery. We have visits to
Bisley to shoot at greater distances
with rifle and muzzle loading pistol
and occasional shotgun shoots
near to London.
The loss of pistol shooting for
the club means the loss of enjoy-
ment for many of our existing
shooters and it also means that the
chance of regaining the honour of
being the best University pistol club
in the country, which we lost to
Oxford last year, may not occur for
some years, if at all.
It was decided last term to
increase the amount of archery
practised, both indoors and out, so
approaches have been made for
funding of this to replace the
Â£8,000 worth of equipment stolen
by the Government and to enable
us to use the gardens behind the
Sports Centre on sunny days and at
longer distances than we can shoot
indoors. If any of this appeals then
come along to the range on
Wednesday afternoons or
Saturdays.
Shooting is a sport for all ages
and physical abilities so do not
miss the opportunity to try it out.
