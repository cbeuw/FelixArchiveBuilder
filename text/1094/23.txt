Amusing
UCL II v ICHC II
9am, first Saturday of term, the
men's 2nds were not impressed
with their captain's meet time.
Nevertheless, after a harrowing trip
via the tube and bus to Slough (?)
Quays. The keeper on duty was the
reserve choice.
The game started, with a sud-
den UCL attack, which was repulsed
with a little less than adequate effi-
ciency. A sustained period of pres-
sure by UCL followed, which result-
ed in a goal as IC struggled to get to
grips with the new players and play-
ing together for the first time.
A spell of good IC play now fol-
lowed with players going close sev-
eral times. Special mention must
go to Shaggy, who after rounding
the keeper managed to find the side
netting. Despite this pressure, IC
couldn't slot the ball into the net.
Towards the end of the first half
UCL mounted a sudden attack and
aided by some lucky moves and
bounces of the ball managed to fire
another goal.
After a solid team talk by our
captain Rick 'Lightweight'
Setchfield, IC took the field with a
renewed sense of verve and vigour.
For most of this half we were on
top, but only managed to find the
net once.
Despite a tremendous effort,
we lost the opening game. One
can only speculate what the result
would have been if the first choice
keeper had turned up and proper
referees had been present.

Keegan Caught
ICFC III v CHAR-
RING CROSS
No coach turned up, so we had to
make our way to leafy Surrey to
face the might of Charing Cross.
Vigorous precipitation didn't help
things as we found ourselves about
to play UMDS - ten minutes later
we found the proper pitches, thor-
oughly soaked (us and them).
Our new, untested team's
apprehension was realised in the
first half when we played shit.
Defensive misunderstandings let
them go one up as their strikers
one-twoed their way down the
wings and through the middle and
made us look merely mortal.
Somehow we put a pass or two
together in spite of this humiliation,
and soon John was on hand to slot
in our equaliser. A third for them
was on the cards until Lee's astute-
ness on the sideline spotted bla-
tant offside in our favour. Their ref,
who had been consistently bad)
during the game, capitulated under
our protests, so we went in at half
time 2-1 down.
COMPETITIONS
Then the fun began. Miles took
over as ref for the second half, and
miraculously decisions began to go
our way. That was the turning
point. Within two minutes, two
goals put us in command as the
gloves came off and IC turned on
the style. Pistol Pete found his feet
as he cut inside from the left and
slotted the ball between the post
and the pretty incompetent keep-
er. Within a minute we struck
again. Miles (the ref) claimed an
assist just before James hit the ball,
and the message, home. Charing
Cross stared in admiration as the
Thirds played more triangles than
Mike Oldfield. Andy's sterling mid-
field work paid off as he slammed
the ball into the roof of the net to
claim our fourth. Our defence on
the left was non-existent thanks to
Lee adopting a left-back-cum-strik-
er role, but who cares? Andy Bellis'
shot from six yards out was
blocked by a defender's face, but a
simple volley from Pistol on the
rebound sealed the victory.
AND we met Kevin Keegan on
the Tube on the way back.
