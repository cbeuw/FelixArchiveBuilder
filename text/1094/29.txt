Sustainability and
the future of the world
Unilever's future depends on the
prosperity and wellbeing of the
people and communities it serves
around the world. Our purpose is
to meet everyday needs of people
everywhere with products and
services which raise the quality of
life. We recognise that we can do
this only if we find more
sustainable ways to run our
company.
What does that really mean?
It means that Unilever needs to
take real action. Eco-efficiency is
producing safe product, efficiently,
from clean processes. So, Timotei
bottles have been reduced in
weight by 60% and washing
detergent packaging has been
minimised through smaller packs
and refills. The washing powder
process now uses 80% less energy
and 90% less water. Freezer
cabinets have been replaced with
CFC free versions and waste
products from tomato processing
are used as a soil conditioner.
Sustainable consumption is
about responsibility and
stewardship of natural resources;
more sustainable patterns of con-
sumption. Unilever has developed
tools to analyse its contribution to
environmental themes such as
global warming, smog,
nutrification and solid waste.
Identifying your problem areas
and setting targets is halfway to
providing your solution.
The Marine Stewardship
Council is a partnership with the
World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF). This partnership is a
practical way to create a
mechanism that uses market forces
to create business incentives for
sustainable fishing. The council
will be an independent, non-profit
body that establishes general
principles for sustainable fishing
and set standards for individual
fisheries. Fish products sourced
from certified fisheries meeting
these standards will be able to be
marked with an on-pack logo (look
out for this in the next few years).
Long term global solutions -
looking at the wider aspects of
major environmental issues
through active engagement of
others - issues such as global
warming, water conservation and
protection of biodiversity need to
be dealt with responsibly and with
a broad base of participation -
Unilever contributes a wealth of
experience and a willingness to
learn and improve to many
partnerships, committees and
development groups across the
world.
The Best Factory Award 1996
In November 1996, Van den Bergh
Foods' margarine factory at
Purfleet, Essex beat 230 other
contenders to win Process Industry
Best Factory and Overall Factory
of the Year in the Management
Today Best Factory Awards. But,
just why is it so special? The
factory has been in operation since
1918, producing almost
continually. It was rebuilt in the
1970's and now works 24 hours a
day, seven days a week to produce
250,000 tonnes of emulsified fats
per year; this supplies over 40% of
the U K market for margarine and
low fat spreads.
This factory used a New Look
Employment Method to re-
approach industrial relations
issues. O l d fashioned
demarcations were broken down,
overtime went and annualised
hours arrived. This ensures staff
are rewarded for doing well rather
than doing badly which the classic
overtime system encouraged.
Resource was also focussed on
small units, which the factory was
broken down - in terms of
management, maintenance and
measurement. Responsibility was
given to operators through the
Total Productive Maintenance
(TPM) programme - this is the
most advanced Unilever site in the
U K in terms of TPM.
The whole thing has been a
cultural change - having visited the
site myself - the staff seem full of
pride and enthusiasm for the
factory as it is now and for the
challenges that still lie ahead.
Training, involvement and a vision
of the future have been a winning
formula at Purfleet.
Unilever Worldwide
Etah integrated rural
development programme
Unilever has worked for about 20
years in the state of Uttar Pradesh,
India, on a rural development
programme to upgrade the animal
husbandry skills of local farms.
This programme known as the
Etah initiative, was originally
designed to improve the quality of
milk available for Unilever's dairy
and has involved the co-operation
on the provision of tube wells,
remediation of saline soils and the
introduction of improved cattle
breeds. The result was a sustained
improvement in the living
standards of over 100 villages in
one of the poorest regions of India.
MANAGEMENT
EDUCATION
B y a current technical trainee
Not only do we carry on with our
education at Unilever, but we do it
in style. Unilever graduate
UCMDS training must be one of
the best programmes in the world.
In the first year you cover
strategic, information and
operations or markets manage-
ment. The amount of knowledge
you gain through the courses and
learning programmes as well as
your job provides a very steep
learning curve - I suspect it won't
stop in my second year! In second
year finance, people and markets
or operations are the courses we
follow.
One of the best aspects is the
week long course that
accompanies three of the modules.
A great chance to meet other
Unilever trainees from different
functions and companies. The
diversities and similarities provide
useful debate within the formal
part of the course - forming a
business as well as social network
during the week. The quality of
speakers and trainers is very good
- often they are experienced
consultants or senior Unilever
managers.
Socially - as well as the week
long courses - trainees tend to
meet up at various times during the
year. Sometimes just for drinks -
others for a big night out or a party.
Overall the training and
associated opportunities at
Unilever, once called a business
school funded by soap powders
and detergents, are excellent -
probably one of the main reasons I
joined.
Tetrahedral tea bags - Just how do you make
those 3D tea bags at nearly 2000 per minute?
