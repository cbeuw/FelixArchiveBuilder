Recruitment at
Unilever 1997/8
By a current technical trainee
Do you want to work for a truly
global company? A company
that gives you a real job -
making decisions, solving
problems, playing an active role?
Then read on...
The next four pages are intended
to let you have an insight into
Unilever plus some extra
information about the technical
side of the business. Unilever is
looking for tomorrow's business
leaders - so some extra information
to help you on your way could be
useful...
Firstly - in order to be one of
tomorrow's business leaders, you
need to be recruited. Unilever
employs a wide range of graduates
onto the " U C M D S " training
programme. To join Unilever in
this way there are a number of
processes that you need to go
through - they are carefully
designed to assess your abilities
and potential and to ensure that
Unilever can fufil
your needs and
ambitions.
It all starts with
the application
J form - I know it is
long - but Unilever
does need to know
as much about you as possible and
the impression you make is
important. It needs to stand out
among the 3000 applications
received every year. (Plus it is a
great starting point to develop any
other applications forms).
After the application form
comes a first interview and a
selection board, you can also apply
for the Christmas course - but
there are many more opportunities
to hear about that later. Perhaps I
should really tell you about some
of the benefits of working with
Unilever: £18k-£21k salary to start
is the primary benefit and it
doesn't stand still when you
actually start work, pension and
life assurance benefits are also
included - as is the 25 days
holiday (that's right, holiday and
the money with which to enjoy it!).
Unilever also has a one year
deferment opportunity and up to
five years career break at a later
stage.
Anything else you want to know
about recruitment - you can find
out at the presentation on 21st
October or in the recruit-
ment brochure or at
"recruit.unileveruk@unilever.com."
Any questions - please do ask.

WEB SITE
http://www.uniq.unilever.com
That's where you will find "The
Uniq - Universal Challenge'. This
Unilever internet site offers free
advice on job applications, tips for
interviews and a chance to do a
personal (and private - Unilever
can't peek) interview to analyse
your skills. There is also a section
about how to apply. There is a
problem solving bit - playing
interactive games and a News
Room page. Remember, up to date
company articles are a useful way
to prepare for an interview. The
fancy, space-age graphics are
worth a look too.
From tea bags to toothpaste
Unilever makes them all
P G Tips Pyramid teabags,
Persil, Solero, C K One, Organics
Shampoo, Colmans Mustard
and Vaseline - What do they all
have in common? - Unilever
makes them.
Unilever owns branded fast
moving consumer goods
companies all over the world -
producing a diverse range of
products. If Unilever aimed to
ensure that everybody, in every
country across the world, used at
least one Unilever product every
day, they would not be too far from
achieving it. Do you use Flora or
Olivio or I Can't Believe It's Not
Butter? - then welcome to the
world of Unilever. When you eat a
Cornetto in the U K , there is a good
chance that somebody in China is
too.
Broadly, products fall into two
categories: foods and home and
personal care. In the UK, the main
foods companies are Birds Eye
Wall's and Van den Bergh Foods.
Birds Eye Wall's makes yummy
ice-creams, the Captain's fish
fingers and frozen peas. Van den
Bergh makes Colmans Mustards,
Chicken Tonight, Flora, Batchelors
Soups and Oxo. In home and
personal care - Lever Brothers
produces Persil, Domestos and
Comfort; Elida Gibbs make
Impulse, Lynx, Dove, Organics
and Mentadent toothpaste and
Diversy Lever makes industrial
detergents.
Internationally, Helene Curtis,
Rexona, Chesebrough-Ponds,
Thomas J Lipton, Iglo, Sagit, Frigo
and Algida are, among others,
Unilever companies. Plus on the
more glamourous side, Calvin
Klein Cosmetics Co. and Elizabeth
Arden.
