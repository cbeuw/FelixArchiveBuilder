Simon Hunter reports on the band keeping Bob Marleyʼs legacy alive
On Monday night I spent the evening
in the Millennium Dome and came to
the conclusion that it should be lev-
elled. It may no longer be called the
Millennium Dome and it may now
have an array of soulless bars/restau-
rants, but the fact remains: it’s a large
tent with the character to match.
his was rather unfortunate as the
Wailers played here (in the IndigO2)
on Monday, and a band with such his-
tory really deserved a venue with a
bit of soul. Last time I was at the In-
digO2 I saw Westwood play about 30
seconds of lots of songs at a student
radio awards show. Continuing with
the bizarre range of musicians that
the venue attracts, both Hanson and
Chas & Dave are to grace the stage
before Christmas.
he Wailers originated as the band
behind Bob Marley but over the dec-
ades the band has morphed, with only
the bassist, Aston Barrett, remaining
from the original line-up. his isn’t
necessarily a bad thing; there’s little
more awkward than watching a gang
of septuagenarians holding them-
selves up with mic stands while croon-
ing breathlessly.
We arrived in time to catch the last
few chords of the support act and take
our place at the bar. Unfortunately,
our spot prevented any sight of Bar-
rett, or ‘king of the reggae bassline’ as
we were frequently reminded by Bob
Marley’s 2013 replacement. On the
plus side, we had a great view of the
audience. I don’t think I’ve ever been
to a gig with such a range of ages in
the audience; a testament, I suppose,
to Marley’s music. Having said this,
the median age
upstairs where
the seats are lo-
cated was deﬁ-
nitely some-
where north of
50.
he show
started slowly
with renditions
of Is his Love
and No Wom-
an, No Cry. It
wasn’t until
the bassline of
Could You Be Loved
sprung from Barrett’s
guitar that the crowd
began to rise from
their seats. Up stood
a girl, dancing away
but watching the show
through an iPad that
was held 5 inches from
her face. However, at
least when she occa-
sionally put the thing
down she knew how to
dance.
By half way through
the show, most people
were on their feet. At
least, the people round
the edges were. hose
that had obviously
been online, hammer-
ing F5, when tickets
went available and had
bagged themselves
nice, central seats didn’t budge for the
entire show. Bizarrely, it seemed that
a cross-section of the most rhythmi-
cally challenged people in London had
decided to turn out. From a lady who
looked to be undergoing some kind of
vertical electric shock treatment, to a
guy who was ﬂailing about like it was
3am in TigerTiger. iPad girl, they were
not. But who am I to judge? hey were
loving it.
Regardless of what you think of reg-
gae music, it’s impossible not to ﬁnd
it infectious. Buﬀalo Soldier had me
bouncing along, but the highlight of
the night really was the encore. here
was an energy in those last few songs
that for some reason didn’t seem to
pervade the rest of the performance.
Exodus and Punky Reggae Party were
particularly good. A mention should
also go to Cegee Victory, the female
vocalist who added some beautiful
harmonies to the songs, but who I
thought should have been used more,
such were her obvious vocal talents.
I still believe that the IndigO2 isn’t a
great venue for the Wailers. he level
of corporate bullshit that comes hand-
in-hand with the O2 seems to detract
somewhat from what Bob Marley and
his music stands for. However, at the
end of the day, it may be what is need-
ed when a large proportion of their
fans now prefer a comfortable seat
over a beer and a blunt.

On tour with the National Youth Choir
I spent the ﬁrst two-and-a-half weeks
ofAugustsinging.Well,notconstantly,
but almost. Now, this was not just a
very long rave, although I certainly
did have a lot of fun. No, this was
perfectionist music making with the
National Youth Choir (‘NYC’ amongst
friends) where singing a note with the
wrong vowel placement was just as
bad as singing the wrong note. I have
been involved in this organisation for
a long time now, but what was special
about this course is that it was truly
national. During our 19 days together
as a choir of about a hundred, we
explored York, Londonderry, Belfast,
London, Cardiﬀ, Edinburgh and
Suﬀolk, performing in seven concerts.
For our ﬁrst few concerts, we
combined forces with a couple of
Irish choirs and the National Youth
Orchestratoperformthemonumental
Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and
the slightly-easier-to-sing Toward
the Unknown Region by Vaughan
Williams. We performed these
both in Northern Ireland and in the
BBC Proms at a packed Albert Hall.
If these concerts were characterised
by their energy and excitement, the
next few concerts were all about
intimacy and blend. Without the
Irish choirs and with no orchestra, we
were a much smaller group and we
set about achieving our characteristic
‘NYC sound’. his abstract concept
is one we are always trying to chase
and we literally spend hours trying
to reach this goal. It is not unknown
for us to spend an hour or so just
working on a couple of lines of music,
but at the end it really is transformed.
here was a lot of work, but plenty
of play too. I recall with fondness a
great evening at a funfair in Cardiﬀ
bay. Banter was abundant, both in
our free time and in rehearsals, and
there were far too many in-jokes
to keep up with. I have no doubt
that I shall remember the great
time I had for many years to come.
