30 FRIDAY 04 OCT
Farmers’ food at the doorstep
Daas Kaluvan proves that quality food exists outside supermarkets
You might have seen the signs around
campus already – there is a new
farmers market on Queens Lawn
every Tuesday. You will be surprised
by how much fresh vegetables and
fruits this is. Apart from the expected
English strawberries, raspberries,
blueberries, plums, apples and pears,
there are also Downland Pigs famous
free range hog roast, Brambletye
Farm’s organic eggs and sweet and
savoury goodies from Queen of
Cakes. None of which you will be able
to get from your local Sainsbury’s.

I made something special for dinner:
Pan-seared Pigeon Breast with
Stuffed Courgette Flowers and
Oven Roasted Potatoes
It’s simple, yet it looks restaurant-
level gourmet due to the not-quite-
common ingredients - you get
amazing ﬂavours and a mix of colour.
You also get to experiment a bit with
pretty cheﬀy techniques, so this recipe
is perfect for those who’ve never tried
stuﬀ like deglazing pans to make gravy,
etc. We’re in-between seasons at the
moment, so sadly courgette ﬂowers
are sort of on their way out (they’re
a summer thing) - but gamey pigeon
breastisperfectfortheautumn/winter.
he beauty of this dish is its
ﬂexibility - there are no food police!
If you can’t ﬁnd courgette ﬂowers,
sub with your own veggies (preferably
the stuﬀ that’s more in season) -
no need to pan-fry with egg wash
necessarily. Or for something just as
impressive, blackberry and game are
known to go quite well together so
you can toss blackberries and salad
leaves, dress, and serve with this
dish. Adjust amounts for a starter or
main, tweak it to make as ﬁlling or
as light as you want depending on
how in-between-seasons you feel.
Ingredients
2 potatoes
4 small pigeon breasts
4 courgette ﬂowers
1 egg, beaten
Plain ﬂour for egg wash
A tart berry jam (we used IKEA’s
Lingonberry, but raspberry works)
½ ball mozzarella
Red wine for gravy
Salt and pepper to season
Preheat your oven to 200 degrees
Celsius, popping a tray of olive oil
in to heat through. Peel and dice
the potatoes into medium chunks,
then parboil in salted water to give a
headstart on cooking, but not until
fully tender. Drain and toss with
the heated oil + desired seasoning
on your tray to give a nice light
coating, then return to the oven.
While waiting, lightly season the
pigeon breasts with salt and pepper,
then place skin side down on a hot pan
andcookforafewminutes.Don’tmove
it about after it ﬁrst makes contact
with the pan; you want it to develop a
nice sear and colour. Like duck breast,
pigeon should not be cooked to death/
greyness - you still want it pinkish, and
it’s not going to take long. Turn over
after a few minutes and cook the other
side in the same way, then remove
from pan and let rest on a plate.
Deglaze the pan with a splash of
red wine, then add a bit of the
lingonberry/raspberry jam and stir
until well combined. Continue to
heat on medium until it reduces,
adding some of the resting juices from
the pigeon breast midway through
(you’ll see them seep out - just throw
them back into the pan.) You want
the gravy to be a bit tart and thick,
so adjust jam amounts with care.
While your gravy slowly reduces,
rinse and dry the courgette ﬂowers.
Cut up your mozzarella ball and stuﬀ,
then dip in beaten egg wash, drip oﬀ
any excess and dust with seasoned
ﬂour (it’s easy - just mix plain ﬂour
with salt and pepper.) Heat a second
pan with a bit of oil and pan-fry the
courgette ﬂowers until the coating
is golden brown. Cheese should be
heated through and somewhat melty-
ish, but don’t cook these veggies to
death! Remove and arrange on plate.
By this time the potatoes should be
ready as well - you should time the
courgette ﬂowers to be cooked a few
minutes before the potatoes are done.
he sauce should have suﬃciently
reduced as well, so turn oﬀ the oven
and the stove, take everything out
and just plate up - then tuck in!
With special thanks to Wild Country
Organics for providing the courgette
flowers. Pigeon meat from the South
Downs Venison and Game stall.
Bloomsbury Marina O Connell talking to customers at the stall. Probably about all the yummy food on offer!
Mmmmm....
If this doesnʼt make you want to visit the market I donʼt know what will!
