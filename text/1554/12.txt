12 FRIDAY 04 OCT
he non-essential services provided
by the US government have grinded
to a halt as there is disagreement in
Congress about the current budget.
his not only weakens the country
ﬁnancially but also shows the ineffi-
ciency US congress has to deliberate
and compromise in situations where
ideologies clash.
he main cause of the budget not
being passed is Obama’s new health
care reform which has been abbrevi-
ated to ‘Obamacare’. he official name
of this reform is Patient Protection
and the Affordable Care Act. he act
is designed to give those Americans
who are not covered by private health
insurance coverage. By doing so, the
government plans to prevent malprac-
tices of various insurance companies.
he plan is also meant to provide cov-
erage that could not be provided with
privately bought health insurance.
hese include plans to provide yearly
check-ups and maternity care. People
who are part of Medicaid (poor and
disabled) have added beneﬁts from
this law. Anyone earning less than
31,000$ per year receives free Medic-
aid.
However, people who do not qualify
for Medicare (senior citizens) and
Medicaid, and don’t have private in-
surance have to pay for Obamacare.
his is the part of the reform which
had to be passed through the 2013-
2014 ﬁnancial year budget. Even then,
20 million people will not be covered
as the law exempts those who are in-
carcerated, who belong to certain re-
ligious groups, illegal immigrants and
those who are willing to pay the pen-
alty for not subscribing.
Why are the Republicans against Oba-
macare?
he opposition has given a number of
reasons as to why they are against this
new Law. Firstly, they believe that the
passing of the bill will increase health
care spending for the government.
his will mainly be caused by the cov-
erage provided for the poorest 18 %.
Furthermore, they believe that it is
not right for the government to force
people to subscribe to something that
they may not particularly want.
However, supporters of Obamacare
state that the Republicans are opposed
to it because they fear that it may ac-
tually work. he people who beneﬁt
the most from Obamacare belong to
red states such as Texas.
As a result, the opposition has shown
serious outrage towards the budget
and has prevented it from passing
through the Senate. Since the deadline
for passing the budget was missed, the
government has been put through a
partial shutdown as per the Ameri-
can constitution. his has resulted in
various non essential services being
closed. hese include museums and
national parks.
An estimated 700,000 people will face
unpaid leave if a compromise is not
met on the budget. Senior officers of
American spy agencies have shown
some fear due to this shutdown.
About 70% of intelligence workers will
lose their jobs. his will cause, they
believe, a grave danger to American
national security.
President Obama can decide on a
‘stopgap’ budget to prevent such a
shutdown from taking place. his will
be a one-week spending bill which
will allow the non-essential services to
function. However, he refused to go
with this proposal when he stated that
the ‘stopgap’ budget will only delay the
inevitable ﬁghting.
his shutdown not only aﬀects the US
but also the international community
as a whole. As a result of globalisation,
economic problems faced by the US
has had the tendency to cause trou-
ble elsewhere as well. A lot of coun-
tries have shown fear as a result of the
shutdown.
My take:
I am disgusted to see how the US con-
gress has dealt with the budget. Just
because of an ideological standpoint,
congressmen seem to be ready to al-
low a large part of their population
to be rendered jobless. I don’t believe
that the Republican Party has pro-
vided any concrete reasons to be fum-
ing about the health care reforms. If
they feel that the scheme will cost too
much, they should provide with eﬀec-
tive measures to reduce such costs.
Asking for a further delay on this is-
sue, however, is simply a means to
prevent a solution. hey already had
a year to provide eﬀective alternatives
to the so called- ‘high cost measures’
but decided not to provide them.
A devastating attack in a shopping
mall in Nairobi took place on the 23rd
of September. Gunmen killed 67 peo-
ple, according to government sources
, in the Westgate Mall. hese militants
were said to belong to the extremist
group originating from Somalia called
Al Shabbab.
But who are these peddlers of terror?
he Al Shabbab is the political wing of
the Somali Council of Islamic Courts,
which took over much of Somalia in
2006. he government and other in-
terim forces eventually defeated these
forces but the group still remained as a
terrorist force. hey have planned and
successfully executed various insur-
gent and other suicide attacks.
According to various sources, they
recruit people, sometimes forcibly,
to take part in these terrorist attacks.
Some claim that young men are forced
by circumstances to join this group to
conduct their operations rather than
because of an ideological support.
he Al Shabbab is more nationalis-
tic in nature than other terrorist or-
ganisations. hey tend to have most
of their operations against the TFG
(Transitional Federal Government of
Somalia). he Al Shabbab has bitter
sentiments against the KDF (Kenyan
Defence Forces) for being present in
Somalia. his animosity has led them
to attack innocent civilians in Nairobi.
In fact, they have promised to inten-
sify their attacks in Kenya if the KDF
does not budge from Somalia. “here
will be pools of blood”, one spokesper-
son for the Al Shabbab stated. Presi-
dent Uhuru Kenyatta stated that the
KDF would stay in Somalia until there
is order restored in Somalia.
