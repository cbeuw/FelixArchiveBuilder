Following months of debate about
the federal budget, the entire US gov-
ernment has today decided to take a
much-needed autumnal holiday. In-
stead of agreeing to a bill to fund the
state, every one of the 100 Senators
and the 435 Representatives decided
to simply let the October 1st deadline
run out. “We realised we were becom-
ing obsessed with the new budget. It
was unhealthy” said speaker of the
House, John Boehner. President of
the Senate, Joe Biden was similarly ef-
fusive “It’s easy to get all het-up about
these things. Taking a step back and
letting the current deal expire will re-
ally allow us to chill out”. “I think we
really deserve that” he added. Whilst,
there has been a split amongst elected
oﬃcials as to whether to go on a holi-
day or simply lounge around at home,
all were agreed that the downtime
was well-earned. “You know, we can’t
agree on all the details” said Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell before add-
ing “the important thing is that we all
get a decent rest”. At press time, Presi-
dent Obama has been seen taking
some time to mow the White House
lawn. Vice-President Biden, however,
has been sighted getting oﬀ a plane in
Ibiza.
As the traditional IC Union Mingle
was going on, so was a so-called
‘Alternative Mingle’, for people who
don’t like the sort of music played
at the Mingle, hosting a series of
live music acts instead of a DJ who
still insists that he is 27 despite
his grey hair and faded tattoos.
he Union was not best pleased with
the presence of the Alternative Mingle.
A Union spokesperson said, “his is
completely missing the point of the
Mingle. he Mingle has been carefully
designed by a team of sociologists to
create an environment in which people
can make as many friends as possible.”
“his is achieved by making the
night as awful as we can so that
people have no choice but to buy
drinks and talk to one another.”
Our Hangman journalist Timothy
McSweeney asked one of the
organisers of the Alternative
Mingle exactly how a separate event
encouraged people to mingle, and
we received the following statement:
“he Alternative Mingle is for
people who don’t want to go to
the Mingle because they might
not like it. We understand that
it’s all about meeting new people,
but really, who wants to meet
someone that likes diﬀerent things?”
“Next year, we’re hoping to have
several alternative alternative mingles
so that people can only go to things
they like with people that like the same
thing. It’s the best way to meet people”
“he long term goal is to have an
individual mingle for each person,
one that is tailored to their favourite
activities. You know, a bit like the
Mirror of ERISED from Harry Potter.”

This week, you’re a super awe-
some RAG committee member
welcoming fresher students.
As you hug some drunkard,
he slowly gurgles snakebite-
tainted puke down your back
that blends in perfectly to your
violently pink polo shirt. You
don’t realise until two days
later when you feel a pigeon
pecking chunks of it from your
shoulder.
This week you go to Reyn-
olds for the first time. You
find yourself actually enjoy-
ing sitting on vomit stained
floors, chanting in unison
with other air-headed “medi-
cal students,” as some guy
downs a litre of Tesco value
vodka. Expect to be hated by
hall mates for the rest of the
year when you fail to shut up
about it.
This week, being the crazy
fresher that you are, you de-
cide to steal a traffic cone.
Whilst heavily intoxicated you
carefully select your roadside
trophy, drag the dead weight
back to halls and triumphant-
ly pass out. You wake up
searching for your prize, only
to find you dragged home
a dead tramp in a sleeping
bag by mistake.
This week you’re too shy to talk
to people so start chatting to
your illegal rice cooker instead.
You name it Wilson, and tell it
the hopes and dreams you har-
bour of getting that first. A Sub-
warden finds you dry hump-
ing it four days later, whilst it
boasts a face made out of your
blood...
This week you return from your
year in Industry, flashing your
easy-earned cash from being
the Goldman Sachs coffee
bitch. You attempt to pay for
your coffee (espresso) with a
fifty in the library cafe, only to
have some PhD student steal
it from you, manically cackling
after not eating properly all
summer.
This week, you find the fabled
fresher on your course that
“totally rejected Oxford,” and
listen to how he just can’t wait
for the awesome London party
scene that Oxford could only
dream of. You find him later
after a night in Metric, slowly
sobbing into his framed ac-
ceptance letter as he tries to
transfer back last minute.
You read out the previous horo-
scope to your kitchen as you
predrink for another wild night
at Fabric, and you all laugh at
how untrue it is and how you
are all going to be friends for-
ever. An awkward pause fol-
lows, whilst you all contemplate
the utopia of true friendship you
desperately hope to discover
one day.
This week you form vapid,
empty, temporary friendships
with the people in your kitchen
by bonding over A-level exams
and failed Oxbridge interviews.
You change your profile picture
to one of 200 group photos from
a night out, with the caption
#Freshers2013, whilst secretly
hoping to meet better people
and dump this group of airheads
This week, you proudly hang a
red lanyard around your neck.
You’ve made it! You can fully
buy discounted coffee! Impe-
rial is the best place ever! A
cynical second year student
jumps you and cuts it off,
severing your carotid artery
in the process. Red spreads
from the lanyard through that
freshly ironed shirt.
This week finally met the Doc-
tor at the Freshers’ Fair! Go
you! You ask him to take you
away to a distant place and
time only to find out that you
have to do him a favour first.
After you climb out of the Heart
of the TARDIS, remove your
pink tutu and stop shivering
he takes you to the future. Wel-
come to Exam Week!
It’s been a long week and
you’ve almost done an all-
nighter. As you walk back to-
wards your room at 7 AM you
see the eager Sabbs arriving
for work. Oh wait, they’re go-
ing home as well, having been
kept awake all night by their
pink t-shirts. They jump you
and fight over the scraps of
your fashionable shirt.
This week you search in ear-
nest for the Masturbation Soc
at Fresher’s Fair, after some
second year told you it was a
key part of the Imperial way of
life. After asking everyone you
meet where the stall may be,
you finally realised you misun-
derstood just what that student
said, and shuffle sadly to your
bedside drawer instead.

Alternative Mingle
Misses the Point A
fter months of heady banter,
second and third year
students have set their targets
for just how many freshers they plan
to sleep with during fresher’s week.
Unfortunately, the Hangman can
oﬃcially report that every single
one of these students has failed
to hook up with a fresher despite
their Shakespearean chat-up lines:
“So, what do you study?”
“You look foreign, where are you
from?”
“What hall do you live in? Does your
window face the street?”
Britain’s leading expert, Dr. Tom
Perignon from the Institute
for Pretend Sociology says that
this is to be entirely expected.
“Our latest research shows that
even a few months at Imperial is
enough to cause a person’s social
skills to completely atrophy. Like
a muscle, social skills waste away
if they are not used often enough.
Interestingly, many students develop
a coping mechanism known as ‘Nerd
Elitism’ where they refuse to talk about
anything that does not interest them. In
severe cases, these students arbitrarily
hate those that do not know how to
play all of the songs from Ocarina
of Time on a touch-tone phone.
