Pushing for cheaper food and drink in pubs and restaurants!
annum, there would be less under-
reporting of cash receipts (‘Tax Gap’)
and as such higher income tax yields
as a result of less under-reporting.
he question we must ask is:
How much will a reduction in VAT
cost the economy?
A reduction in VAT from 20% - 5%
would result is a direct loss of £5.5
billion (excluding alcohol). However,
the research suggests that once the
indirect gains from the reduction of
VAT has been taken into account, the
net ﬁscal cost would be between £0.7
and £3.1 billion. he research also
suggests that the reduction in VAT
would create between 290,000 and
670,000 jobs. An example of this was
in early 2012, when President Nicolas
Sarkozy declared the VAT decrease
had saved 30,000 cafés and restaurants
that were struggling ﬁnancially.
One other sector which could
beneﬁt enormously from the decrease
in tax is hotel accommodation. As
of January 1st 2012, 22 European
countries had a reduced rate of
Axe VAT for the hospitality industry

How can reducing VAT help the
economy?
With high unemployment levels and
increasing difficulty in ﬁnding jobs,
the job market in the UK along with
the economy needs boosting. One
method suggested by the VAT club
founded by Jacques Borel is that a
reduction in VAT would increase
sales and employment, bringing
long term beneﬁts to the economy.
VAT (Value Added Tax) is the tax
on the purchase price of goods.
his is an indirect tax, which is
enforced on all people regardless of
their wealth; a poor person would
be taxed the same amount on a
product as a rich person would be.
According to Jacques Borel, one
sector which would beneﬁt widely
from reduced VAT is the hospitality
sector. his particular sector mounts
an incredibly strong argument for the
reduction of VAT. he total number
of jobs in the hospitality sector in the
UK is approximately 2 million and the
industry is particularly important in
providing ﬁnancial stability to young,
unskilled, and disadvantaged workers.
he Association of Licensed Multiple
Retailers job tracker research showed
that licensed hospitality created 1 in 6
jobs for 18-24 year olds. he expansion
of this sector is relatively easy, with
pubs, bars, and cafes with low barriers
of entry. Lower VAT rates would be
able to stimulate the creation of new
businesses and jobs in the sector.
On top of that, the VAT reduction
would lead to lower prices in food,
possibly higher salaries for employees
and better training, therefore
increasing the quality of service.
Another argument for the reduction
of VAT for the hospitality sector
is to keep it fair and in line with
supermarkets. Currently pubs and
restaurants pay 20% VAT on food
and drinks, whilst supermarkets pay
0% VAT. his has led to many people,
especially students deciding to eat
in rather than out, meaning fewer
people supporting the on-trade and
the jobs created there. hey claim that
it is not fair that supermarkets pay a
fraction of the tax pubs pay per pint.
However, a reduction in tax would
lead to a direct decline in income for
the treasury via VAT receipts. Jacques
Borel suggests however that this
diﬀerence would be made up for by
higher income tax, National Insurance
payments, higher corporation tax
receipts, saving in unemployment
beneﬁts and through the fact that
more businesses will end up paying
tax. his is because there will be less
incentive for small businesses to stay
below the tax threshold of £77,000 per

VAT for hotel accommodation,
while 13 countries had a reduced
rate to cafés, pubs, restaurants and
catering services. he cost of living in
hotels is a danger to the UK tourism
industry and we must keep prices
competitive with those abroad.
In order to bring this campaign
to light, the VAT club organised a
Tax Parity Day. his was held on the
25th September 2013, where over 44
businesses (15,000 outlets) across the
country took part in campaigning
and participating in Tax Parity Day.
hese included JD Weatherspoons
and Punch Taverns. All businesses
(40% restaurants, 60% pubs) which
took part in the event lowered their
prices by 7.5% in support of a VAT cut.
Borel claims “If we compare with what
has happened in Germany, Finland,
Belgium and France, if you make a
7.5% price cut, you will have 25% more
clients, which is very signiﬁcant.”
Borel also says that 10,000 pubs have
closed and many others are suﬀering
through insufficient investment.”
his project however has not had
much reception by the treasury.
In short, we should all consider
supporting lower VAT for food and
drink in the hospitality industry, as
this promises to boost the size of
the industry whilst lowering the cost
to us customers. So join supporters
of this campaign such as Pret a
Manger, Weatherspoons, Subway,
and TGI Fridays, Pizza Hut etc,
and campaign for fair VAT rates.
