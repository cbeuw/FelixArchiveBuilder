September, Imperial
and University College
London oﬃcially
announced that the
Translation Studies Unit (TSU) at
Imperial will be moving to UCL.
he TSU will be moving to UCL’s
School of European Languages,
Culture and Society, within the
Faculty of Arts and Humanities. he
school is well known internationally
and it encourages interaction and
exchange amongst specialists across
the Arts and Humanities.
A spokesperson from Imperial said
the move of the unit will “capitalise on
its existing long-term collaboration
with translation experts from [UCL],
allowing it greater scope to develop
its research and education activities in
the future”.
Earlier in February of this year, the
College declared that the activities
undertaken by the unit would be
reviewed, as they were thought not to
be“integraltothedeliveryofImperial’s
academic strategy”. herefore the TSU
has dodged the worst case scenario of
closure.
he TSU was founded in 2001
and primarily deals with science
translation and has over 50 MSc
students and 25 PhD students.
he Head of the TSU, Dr Jorge
Díaz-Cintas commented: “We are
very excited about the opportunities
that this move to another world-
class institution like UCL will bring
for us. UCL has a great track record
in translation and we have been
collaborating with them for many
years. We are really looking forward
to working with our new colleagues to
make sure that translation continues
to be as highly successful in our new
home as it has been at Imperial during
the last 12 years.”
he Dean of UCL’s Faculty of Arts
and Humanities, Professor Jonathan
Wolﬀ, stated: “I’m delighted to
welcome the Translation Studies Unit
to UCL. We have been long-standing
admirers of their work, and believe
that together we will provide world
leading expertise in audiovisual,
technical and literary translation.”
Professor Debra Humphris, Pro
Rector (Education) here at Imperial
responded with: “This move draws
the TSU into a greater critical mass of
translation expertise and enables it to go
from strength to strength in the future.
We wish all of the Unit’s members the
very best in their future work.”
At the time of writing the Union
had yet to release an official response.
However in a meeting on the twelfth
of February students from the TSU
presented a paper to the Union Council
detailing their concerns about the way
the decisions were bring carried out
and the impact College’s actions would
have on current TSU students. This
lead to the Union Council officially
supporting the student run campaign
against the proceedings.
