Some guys just can’t handle La Paz
B
olivia isn’t exactly a
fresh addition to the
Latin American gringo
trail – it features heavily
in countless itineraries
(indeed, I even ran into an old Felix
editor whilst there) – yet it’s managed
to retain an essence of individuality
whilst neighbouring countries have
started to subside. he population of
the entire country is barely larger than
London’s, with 60% of the population
calling themselves indigenous: it is a
vibrant place bursting with culture
and epic, Martian landscapes.
Close to the northern border with
Peru sits La Paz, the world’s highest
administrative capital. he city is
situated in a crater, the surrounding
hills of which are sprinkled with
suburban dwellings, and framed
by massive, snow-capped peaks,
which one can climb if one is so
inclined. As with most cities, La Paz
gets an incredible range of reviews,
depending on who you’re asking, and
how bad the weather was when they
were visiting. Personally, I found that
it sucked me in, until I eventually had
to throw myself on a bus just to get
out and see more of the continent.
A discussion of the city would be
impossible without at least a passing
reference to cocaine. San Pedro
Prison, situated in a beautiful plaza in
the centre of the city, rose to notoriety
thanks to Rusty Young’s book
Marching Powder, which outlines the
life of convicted trafficker homas
McFadden, highlighting the extreme
levels of corruption, as illustrated
by the fact that he was able to oﬀer
tourists excursions inside the jail.
More recently, Route 36 has been
dubbed “the world’s ﬁrst cocaine
bar”, allegedly oﬀering backpackers
the sort of service you could expect
from any of the pretentious west
end London clubs, but with even
more cocaine. But one would hope
that for the seasoned traveller, the
endless legitimate attractions on oﬀer
would be incentive enough to visit.
U
rban Rush
I feel obligated to go
beyond a glowing TripAdvisor review
and give the guys at Urban Rush a
special mention here. If you’re in
the neighbourhood, put this on your
to-do list. And if you’re not in the
neighbourhood, get rerouting. he
concept of Urban Rush is simple: dress
upinaridiculouscostume,clipyourself
to a rope, and throw yourself face ﬁrst
from a seventeen storey building. he
owners assure me that nobody has
sustained any injuries to date, but I’d
highly recommend getting your eight
hours before giving this one a go.
he costumes on oﬀer cater to most
tastes, whether you fancy yourself as
Spider-Man or a deranged patient
from Amityville, but if you’re not
ﬁxated on travelling light you could
even pack your own and add a bit of
variety to your photos. After a quick
but informative training session,
you suddenly ﬁnd yourself dangling
from the building, about to embark
on your forward-facing abseil. And
when you get to the tenth storey,
it’s time to leap out from the wall
and let go of the rope, putting your
life in the hands of a stranger as
your plummet to your death. he
sensation is pretty bizarre, but it’s
perfectly safe and makes for some
pretty sweet photos (as well as boring
stories to share with strangers in the
smoking area of your next night out).
T
he death
road
Of course, no trip would be
complete without mountain biking
down the world’s most dangerous
road. Dubbed so because of the
hundreds of travellers who would
fall and die annually whilst using
the road, it now mostly serves as a
tourist attraction that still has its
fair share of fatalities, which is why
again it’s important to get your eight
hours, and even more important to
identify a reputable company with
solid equipment that won’t fail you
as you zip along the cliﬀ’s edges.
he whole trip takes a day, starting
with an early morning bus ride that
dumps you at the top of a huge,
continuous downhill stretch that
begins in the cooler altiplano before
descending into rainforest. he
majority of the route is single-lane,
and runs alongside drops of hundreds
of metres, all without the protection
of guardrails. hat said, most people
who avoid excessive recklessness
manage to complete the route without
as much as a graze. Most tours
conclude at Senda Verde, an animal
refuge where volunteers can work
with a variety of animals including
several species of monkey, and/or
a booze-fuelled pool party where
revellers bask in the fact that they’ve
actually managed to survive the day.
H
uayna
Potosi
If jumping out of buildings or
downhill biking isn’t your sort of
thing, then you probably won’t be
keen to tackle Huayna Potosi, the
6110 metre mountain situated just
north of the city. he peak has been
dubbed “the easiest 6000er in the
world”: not a reﬂection of a lack of
technical difficulty, but due to the ease
of acclimatisation thanks to La Paz’s
staggering altitude. In any case, it’s
certainly not for the faint-hearted. he
only reason I bothered was because I
was waiting on a custom-made leather
jacket from the blue market and had
three days to kill. Not that I regret it,
but I deﬁnitely should have looked
into what it entailed a little more.
he entire excursion takes three
days. Day one is strictly for training:
getting accustomed to using your
crampons and pickaxe on a glacier
close to the lower base camp. Day
two involves lugging all of your
equipment (travel light) to the upper
base camp in time for sleeping at
the upper base camp at 6 p.m. Day
three begins at midnight, when
you wake up and climb in order to
summit for sunrise. he views were
spectacular, and there’s a certain
credibility about completing a 6000
metre peak at a time when too many
people are raving about Kilimanjaro.

One of the fantastic perks of visiting
an up-and-coming destination like
La Paz is that there are still priceless
gems to be found at ridiculous prices.
Forget the hustle and bustle of the
city’s dingier hostels and opt for
Stannum. Despite being in its infancy
it’s already the top rated hideaway
on TripAdvisor, and boasts elegant
contemporary design combined
with classical details, not to mention
outrageous views over the beautiful
city from its endless glass panels.
he rooms are comfortable, the staﬀ
are friendly, and the bartenders serve
up some truly lethal concoctions
(especially at that price). Check out
stannumhotels.com for more details.
La Paz rocks. Too many people
marginalise it as a stopover between
Uyuni’s salt ﬂats and darkest Peru, but
it’s great in its own right. Admittedly
the handful of activities described
here are a limited selection: I haven’t
even discussed the colourful markets
oﬀering everything from high
quality crafts to llama foetuses, or
the availability of Michellin-starred
restaurants that’ll set you back as
much as an Orange Wednesday at
Pizza Express. Get it on your list,
and give it the time it truly deserves.
