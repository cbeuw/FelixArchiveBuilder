A painting of a lumpen knot of thumbed clay maps out the awkward spread of entwined ﬁgures, alluding to
the charged emotions that such an embrace could induce... Or something like that.
BLYTH GALLERY
The Artistic Influences of Mountain Sitting
Clara Clark Nevola reviews the latest from Imperialʼs art gallery
What: Sitting With The Qualities of
a Mountain Exhibition
Where: Blyth Gallery, Sherfield
Building, Imperial College
When: 2nd Oct - 1st Nov 2013
Price: FREE
N
ext time you’ve got a 20
minute break around
college, head up to
the 5th ﬂoor of the
Sherﬁeld Building, to
the Blyth gallery.
In case you are unfamiliar with it,
the Blyth is Imperial’s very own art
gallery, and holds exhibitions and
workshops throughout the year.
he small collection currently
exhibiting there is titled Sitting With
he Qualities of a Mountain, and at
ﬁrst sight, there is really very little
to see. he ten artworks showcased
are all slightly underwhelming, the
most eye-catching piece being a
microphone caked in clay wired up to
a speaker (What Can Clay Hear? by
Rita Evans).
However, I urge you to take a closer
look. Viewed as a collection, rather
than individual artworks, the pieces
give a coherent view of the human
qualities that we attribute to natural
materials. It is human nature to
anthropomorphise the world around
us, and the soft organic shapes of
clay, mud and stone lend themselves
perfectly to being rendered human.
Damien Meade’s Structure III, a
painting of entwined rolls of clay,
suggests the intimacy of an embrace
without any human reference – a
double vision of a pile of mud and a
human gesture.
Annabel Elgar’s Companion (4)
comes out and boldly says what the
exhibition is actually about: we, as
humans, would actually like the
inanimate world around us to have
feelings, and willingly imagine the
earth from a ﬂower pot springing
to life to gaze longingly out of the
window. Also exhibited, on the other
side of the room, are Rita Evans’s three
small installations. Rocks (geologists
rejoice!) are placed against pretty
colours and mirrors, thus taking on a
pleasing, almost feminine quality.
Framing the two sides of the
gallery are also Stuart Cumberland’s
large black and white oil paintings,
seemingly random black lines which
swim into focus as human body parts.
And bang in the middle of the room
is Patrick Guns’s YHVH. H.O.O.Q.-
can’t really help you with this one but
apparently the bones are meant to be
bonobo bones. Do let me know if you
have an insight on it.
