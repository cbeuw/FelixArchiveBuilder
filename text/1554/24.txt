Come see the hunks in action
his week we have two more massive
ﬁlms for you all to see over at
Imperial Cinema: the newly rebooted
Superman ﬂick Man of Steel produced
by ‘Batman Saviour’ Christopher
Nolan featuring hunk of the month
Henry Cavill and Brad Pitt VS. zombie
apocalypse in World War Z
Man of Steel explores the making
of Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent from
his auspicious arrival in Kansas from
Krypton, his adoption by Jonathan and
Martha Kent and his gradual journey
towards acceptance of his identity
and his destiny. We also see familiar
faces from Superman folklore such
as Lois Lane (Amy Adams), General
Zod (Michael Shannon) and Jor-El
(Russell Crowe). Along with stunning
cinematography and special eﬀects,
what elevates Man of Steel from
being a formulaic origins story is the
excellent casting. Boardwalk Empire’s
Michael Shannon is perfect as the
malicious Zod and Amy Adams’ Lois
Lane is brilliantly feisty (a welcome
break from previous incarnations).
World War Z stars Brad Pitt as a UN
do-gooder trying to defeat a global
zombie pandemic. Director Marc
Forster puts the ﬁlm’s astronomical
budget (reported to be $200 million)
to spectacular use; depicting scenes
of anarchy and carnage on a colossal
scale, they feel chillingly authentic.
Whilst the ﬁlm may require a little
‘cognitive estrangement’ there is
an overpowering sense of suspense
lacking from many summer
blockbusters.

BFI London Film Festival: it’s a New World after all...
John Park
Film Editor
New World
Director: Hoon-jung Park
Writer: Hoon-jung Park
Starring: Jung-jae Lee, Min-sik
Choi, Jung-min Hwang, Sung-
woong Park
Runtime: 134 minutes
Certification: 18
Even from its opening scene, New
World means business. An already
bloodied man gets further beating
whilst being interrogated. Those hold-
ing the hammers and crowbars are
convinced that he’s a snitch, report-
ing their gang’s activities to the po-
lice. And herein lies the film’s main
premise - shifting loyalties between
good and bad, and a lead character
reluctantly stuck in the middle of an
impending war.
A cross between Infernal Affairs/
The Departed and The Godfather,
this highly sophisticated and styl-
ish gangster film is the latest offering
from South Korea, a part of the Asian
market that excites the international
movie industry with some excellent
new offerings - of which this is cer-
tainly one.
Ja-sung (Jung-jae Lee) is an under-
cover police offcer who for the past
eight years or so, dedicated his life in-
filtrating one of the biggest, most dan-
gerous crime syndicates in Korea. His
handler Chief Kang (Min-sik Choi)
promises an end to this delicate nature
of his job - but everything turns upside
down when the syndicate’s boss dies
in a sudden traffic accident.
With no clear sign of leadership or
guidance, an internal power struggle
soon ensues, something the police are
also interested in - as they also have
a stake in who they can control more
conveniently with whatever leverage
they have up their sleeve.
Suddenly Ja-sung is thrown into
even more backstabbing and betrayal
than he is prepared to handle, as even
the good guys appear rather shady
with their own intentions and mind-
games with the syndicate members.
The two big names eyeing a po-
tential takeover for power are Jung
Chung (Jung-min Hwang) and Joong-
gu (Sung-woong Park), and this com-
petition is headed for disaster from
day one as old rivalry resurfaces, one
that can only be settled when blood is
spilled.
And yes, plenty of blood is spilled
throughout, but the film is more in-
terested in dialogue between these
fascinating, layered characters played
by some of the top acting names in
Korea.
Min-sik Choi is excellent at keeping
his cool even in the most unfavour-
able scenarios for his character, and
with his suave demeanour he rattles
the criminals - he is an actor of pure
charisma, something he puts to good
use here. Jung-jae Lee also shines in
the lead, as a man ready to crack under
the enormous pressure.
But the actor taking the acting cake
is without doubt Jung-min Hwang -
his unmatchable knack for handling
the outrageously hysterical as well as
the deadly serious in one clean swoop,
is a talent showcase for Hwang who
consistently steals every scene he’s in.
When it comes to the action that
no doubt got its 18 certificate from,
director Park dreams small, but is al-
ways intricate in his design and set-up.
Even the briefest moment of stand-off
is a hugely tense one, a gun-fight of
a few minutes is extraordinary, and a
knife-fight in a parking lot is a sight to
behold.
The closing scene is one that is
hugely reminiscient of The Godfather,
and much like its inspiration, here’s
a gangster/crime film that delivers
much of its power through words.
