Runner Runner, this film is a mess
I was reasonably hopeful going
into the cinema. Ben Aﬄeck has
been very cautious choosing which
ﬁlms he acts in lately; since 2010 he
has only been in ﬁlms he directed
himself and a Terrence Malick drama.
Justin Timberlake hasn’t quite had a
breakout performance, but he’s been
consistently solid in every ﬁlm he’s
been in. And director Brad Furman
had previously directed the very well
received thriller he Lincoln Lawyer.
here was nothing to suggest this ﬁlm
was going to be as awful as it turned
out.
Runner Runner is the story of Richie
Furst (Timberlake), a savvy university
student who tries to win enough
money playing online poker to pay for
his tuition fees. But then it isn’t. hen
it’s the story of how he is cheated out
of his money and has to go to Costa
Rica to ﬁnd the poker website’s shady
owner Ivan Block (Aﬄeck). But then it
isn’t. hen it’s the story of him having
to work in the corrupt, Costa Rican
gambling-based economy. But then...
you get the point.
With seemingly no focus on
anything resembling a plot the ﬁlm
trudges along, scene after scene in
which stuﬀ happens but none of it
matters. Characters jump in and out

of the plot, relatively important events
are either forgotten or postponed to
accommodate another scene of Richie
and Ivan having a party. he one
plotline that stays consistent is one
of the dullest romantic subplots ever
put on ﬁlm, between Richie and Ivan
Block’s colleague Rebecca Shafran
(Arterton).
here is at one point a small sliver
of hope that Ivan Block will turn out
to be a sociopath, which would make
it somewhat interesting to see how
a sociopath would operate within
the extreme corruption and brutal
policing of Costa Rica. But then he
doesn’t. Meanwhile, Justin Timberlake
plays the same character he played in
he Social Network without the sharp,
Aaron Sorkin dialogue that made
his scummy persona entertaining.
Without it he puts on a performance
so wooden he should’ve been credited
as Justin Timberocean.
In the end, while some bits of it
are abysmal, nothing in the ﬁlm
is oﬀensively bad. At least in that
case there would be some reason
to recommend it. Instead it is just
very, very dull. I have a soft spot for
gambling ﬁlms, even ones that are
admittedly not good. But at least
those ﬁlms have a clear idea of where
they start and where they want to go.
Runner Runner starts everywhere and
goes nowhere.

Jasmine French (Blanchett) is a hard
character for Imperial students to
relate to: she’s rich, she wants to go
into interior decorating, she knows
nothing about ﬁnance, and she’s a
woman. he ﬁlm intercuts scenes
from two periods of her life; one shows
the ostentatious life she leads paid for
by her banker husband Hal Francis
(Alec Baldwin). he other happens
after her husband is sent to prison
for fraud and Jasmine ﬁnds that she
is useless without him, or rather his
money. She’s then forced to move in
with her sister Chili (Cannavale) and
live modestly while she tries to get her
old life back. Meanwhile, Chili has
trouble with her many relationships
(something Imperial students will also
have trouble relating to).
It’soneofWoodyAllen’sbestabilities
to make the audience identify with
a character who would normally be
overly irritating. Impressively, he does
this here with every character. his
establishes an interesting problem
for the audience as we sympathise
with everyone despite the fact that
they all hate each other. Woody Allen
directs a good cast, but in this case
it’s his fantastic script that has to be
credited for establishing convincing
relationships between the ﬁlm’s many
characters quickly enough that the
story keeps moving forward.
But the ﬁlm’s success lies squarely
on the strength of Cate Blanchett’s
performance. She’s vapid, elitist, and
self-absorbed and it’s these traits
which make her entertaining to watch,
but they aren’t so overpowering that
it completely dehumanises her. In
the end we -maybe not like her- but
tolerate her and want her to turn her
life around. It’s this subtle balance
which makes the ﬁlm. here are times
though when the ﬁlm feels like it is
stuck and the characters’ development
isn’t progressing, something that’s
crucial in a ﬁlm that’s exclusively
about character development. Not
that the ﬁlm is too long but a couple of
scenes, particularly in the last third of
the ﬁlm, could’ve been cut.
Quirky characters (like a loveable
sound engineer played by the brilliant
Louis C.K.), funny dialogue, upper
class white people drinking martinis...
it’s a very Woody Allen ﬁlm, but it’s
also accessible. After a very bumpy
ride with him over the past decade,
his fans will appreciate it as one of his
recent best though I fear that the level
of his earlier work is sadly behind him
now. For someone who isn’t familiar
with his work, this is a very good place
to start.
