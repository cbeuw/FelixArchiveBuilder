For a long time Awesomenauts had a
lonely existence in my Steam library.
I picked it up in a sale and then there
it sat unplayed. One day prompted
by fellow editor Max I ﬁnally played
it and realised the mistake I had
made! Straight from the opening
titles I knew I would love this game
so sit tight for my “AWESOME!
AWESOME! AWESOME!” review.
Awesomenauts is a side-scrolling
multiplayer battle game developed
and published by Ronimo games.
his is a game unlike any I have
played before, but immediately I
am a fan. he premise is that you
are a mercenary hired by a drilling
company to mine solar. However
another drilling company has also
hired mercenaries so it quickly
escalates into a battle for control. It
combines strategy with some real
time ﬁghts, and does so successively.
This side-scolling sci-fi adventure shooter is amazeballs!
In each battle the goal is to destroy the
turrets of the other team, with your
3 teammates, while defending your
turrets. Drones are also spawned to
help you out. As you destroy and kill
the other team you will earn solar
which you can use to upgrade your
character. Once the turrets have
been destroyed you work to destroy
the drill core of the other team
which wins the game for your team.
here is a short tutorial which
teaches you the basics, after that you
can choose to play against AI, but the
real fun is online. Finding a game is
short! I hardly had to wait anytime at
all. he game gives you a lot of options
for personalisation. From choosing
your character (and skins that you
can purchase for them) to special
abilities you will be able to spend solar
on in the game you can really ﬁnd
that perfect combination that works
for you. Completing games earns
you XP which enables you to level
up which unlocks more characters,
options for your characters and
maps. his helps you to not feel
overwhelmed at the beginning by all
the options. As you learn by playing
games you also get better characters
and more options. Besides all this
levelling up is always a satisfying
experience. Visually Awesomenauts
is a very pretty cartoony game. he
music, also great, helps to give it
a kids TV battle programme kind
of theme which really works well!
Where this game really stood
out for me was playing with your
friends. hree people on each team
means you can easily get two other
people to game with you and this will
provide hours of fun. I enjoyed a very
eventful session of being shouted at
on Skype, sadly a game experience
I am used to when playing with this
particular friend, while being killed
in increasingly embarrassing ways.
It doesn’t matter whether you are
winning or losing, Awesomenauts
is always hilarious. Even when my
keyboard broke I was able to keep
playing thanks to the controller
support. Playing with a controller
is intuitive and easy despite the fact
that aiming is done with the same
controls as walking. I’m not usually
a fan of multiplayer battle games but
Awesomenauts is both casual enough
for me and competitive enough for my
critical friend that we both enjoyed it.
I would recommend this game to
anyone who wants a fun multiplayer
experience. It’s a great game to have
for just killing 30 minutes here and
there or for an evening of fun. For
the price of £6.99 this game is a steal!

Every so often a steam discount/sale
comes along and I see a game for a
price I cannot refuse. Surprisingly
enough this happens more than I
wish it would, and so I end up with
a boatload of games that I have
absolutely no time or energy to spend
on them. Game Dev Tycoon was one
of these games. An absolute bargain at
the time (£7), I had seen lots about this
game on the internet and so I decided
to buy it. However it was lying around
in my library for about a week before
I even had the chance to start it up.
Game Dev Tycoon is a indie game
created by Greenheart Games last
year, and revolves around you creating
a successful games studio. Starting
out in your parents garage in the 80s
it is your mission to make a successful
company that can withstand pretty
much anything. Pretty much
everything is up to your imagination,
you can name your company, the
games you want to develop, etc.
he gameplay itself is very simple
and intuitive. I did not need any sort
of tutorial to ﬁgure out what was going
on from the start. he game creating
Max Eggl discovers that, woah, he can totally develop games
process is very clear and enjoyable.
You basically just click on your sitting
guy, get some options and then choose
from those options. You can choose
anything from the name to the layout
of the quests for your game. his lead
me to create some really hilarious
games (e.g. A time travelling adventure
called “Save Jesus”, for some reason it
bombed...I still haven’t ﬁgured out
why!). Furthermore this complete
modiﬁability allows for a lot of replay
value, for if you want to go through
each diﬀerent combination (let
alone come up with names) it
will take you a very long time!
he “story”, if I may call it
such, is quite immersive
and the releases of actual
real consoles over the
years really does make
it feel like you are a
game developer who
is struggling to make a
mark. he progression
of research is also brilliant,
as it makes you work for
something as well as allowing
for a goal. I mean the moment you
are able to release your own console
after your h u m b l e
beginnings is one of the most
satisfying things I did!
I do have to say though that the
reviewers criticism seems a bit
random, in the sense that I had two
games with all the same options
however one bombed, and one
succeeded. here was only minimal
variation between the two and yet they
apparently totally diﬀer in success.
However once I checked out the wiki
(there is an entire wiki!), it made a
bit more sense to me. here are
some neat algorithms behind
the reviewing process.
However since this game
is quite repetitive, in the
sense that you are pretty
much doing the same
thing over and over
again, I can see a
limited amount
of hours that you
can pour into it.
Furthermore with
no updates or DLC
planned, the original is
what you are stuck with.
herefore I don’t see myself pushing
20 hours, if even that. However
considering the price I paid for the
game, it was completely worth it.
he graphics of this game are quirky
and cartoony, meaning that while you
willnotseeanythingthatwillblowyour
mind, it will run pretty much on any
computer without any problems or lag.
On a positive note, this game runs on
PCandMacandisavailableonsteam,so
it easily accessible and downloadable.
It seems that Felix Games editors
fall to the curse of the indie game
addiction, and I can already see the
ﬁrst symptoms. his is already my
second indie game review, and to my
dismay I am hoping it is not my last.
Indie games like this blow originality
and new ideas into this stagnating
ﬁeld, where only certain formulas
seem to be released annually. Anyway,
if you are a fan of the indie game
community check it out. Otherwise,
have a look anyway and you may be
pleasantly surprised! I mean, when
are you ever going to get the chance to
create a game, name it whatever you
want (and I mean WHATEVER you
want) see it become ultra successful?
