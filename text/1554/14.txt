I’ve had a pretty typical freshers
week.
I’ve attended about a million wel-
come talks that go along the lines
of “You’re the best. You’re going
to have to work fucking hard. But
YOLO!” I’ve spent days without a
swipe card, struggling to tailgate
into every building, because I’m
avoiding the queue at the ID card
oﬃce. I’ve signed up for dozens of
mailing lists that I’m only going to
unsubscribe from (if I ever ﬁgure
out how), and woken up in a nest of
leaﬂets with details of the available
pastoral care, and even the times
for the men’s rugby tryouts. Where
did that even come from?!
I worried way too much about
what to wear on my ﬁrst day that
would convey that I had more im-
portant things to do than worry
about what to wear (but show that
I’m eﬀortlessly cool anyway, of
course). And then I berated myself
the next day for not being both-
ered to wash my hair. I overslept
on my second day, meaning that
I probably missed something im-
portant, like ﬁnding out where I’m
supposed to be.
I met the people who I’m going
to spend the next three years with,
and tried to resist the urge to wrap
my arms around them and whis-
per needily in their ear, “You’re
stuck with me now, you have to be
my friend!” Okay, that’s not (quite)
true, but I have made a lot of
slightly awkward, stilted conversa-
tion, and in nervous hysteria told
a few too many stories that might
have made me come across as a bit
strange.
I failed at cooking spaghetti, al-
though that’s probably due to all
the free beer I picked up some-
where along the way, and I dis-
played an embarrassing lack of
public transport smarts by nar-
rowly avoiding getting my bag
dipped in a major station while I
managed to make the automated
ticket machine not sell me a travel-
card.
Hi, my name is Tessa, and I’m a
ﬁrst year PhD student. his is the
beginning of my sixth year at Im-
perial. It turns out that no matter
how together you had everything
last week, things never change
when it comes to starting some-
thing new.

Ed Miliband: Ethics Over Dogma?

FRIDAY 04 OCT
T
his article was catalysed by
the recent conference of
he Conservative Party held
in Manchester, where volu-
minous Government policy
was proposed and discussed. he
‘Work for Beneﬁts’ plan proved to be
a topic of discussion as Chancellor,
George Osborne, revised the criteria
for Jobseeker’s Allowance Qualiﬁca-
tion.
His proposals (in relation to long-
term unemployed British citizens)
were threefold. First oﬀ, he intends
to galvanise candidates towards work
placements, including roles such as
“cleaning up litter”. Secondly, provid-
ed that this measure failed to be em-
bellished and augmented, daily Job
Centre visits would become compul-
sory. he ﬁnal proposal encompassed
participation in compulsory skills
training. To cite George Osborne,
“here is no option of doing noth-
ing for your beneﬁts, no something-
for-nothing anymore.”
“hey will do useful work to put
something back into their commu-
nity; making meals for the elderly,
cleaning up litter…and for those with
underlying problems, like drug ad-
diction and illiteracy, there will be an
intensive regime of support.”
To my mind the Chancellor’s com-
ments appeared condescending to
the many millions of people beneath
the breadline across the UK. While
honouring the mantra of he Con-
servative Party (‘For Hardworking
People’) they unilaterally demon-
ise those people receiving beneﬁts.
here is no mention of the thousands
of overly-qualiﬁed denizens (with in-
ﬁnitely many preﬁxes to their names)
who, locked into the beneﬁt system
by circumstance, ﬁnd that there is no
place for their skills within a fragile
British economy. George Osborne
has instead chosen to uniformly
denigrate the ﬁnancially unfortunate,
caricaturing them as unskilled and
debauched; all because they are de-
pendent upon the State.
Where unemployment beneﬁt was
once conveyed as a compassionate,
humanitarian safety net, it is now
misconstrued as a burden to the Brit-
ish taxpayer.
Meanwhile the Health Secretary,
Jeremy Hunt, addressed the Forty
Group (MPs with slender majorities
in their constituencies), putting for-
ward a ﬁve point plan for ‘routing’ the
opposition. To quote Mr. Randeep
Ramesh of he Guardian,
“he most striking thing was the
Tory recasting of Ed Miliband…the
message of the labour leader had to
shift from him being ‘hopeless to dan-
gerous’ as the public has sympathy
for ‘hopeless’ people because they are
seen as underdogs.”
It could be argued that the meet-
ing’s focus typiﬁed the crux of mod-
ern Tory politics, where voters are
regarded as pawns on a political
chessboard. his is evident in context
of many initiatives spearheaded by the
coalition. David Cameron’s veto of the
recent European Treaty, attempts to
redact the Human Rights Act, zero-
hour contracts, the bedroom tax and
the trimming of disability allowance
convey to voters that there is always
someone beneath them, burdening
both themselves and the UK ﬁscally,
even morally.
he eﬃcacy of these initiatives can
also be called into question. Depart-
ment for Work & Pensions ﬁgures
demonstrate a 10% success rate for the
2011 ‘Compulsory Work’ scheme. It
is possible that intricate layers of bu-
reaucracy serve as a buﬀer, preserv-
ing the true wealth among the few. By
adhering to the party and not to the
people, politicians may be perceived
to be laying the seeds for a British plu-
tocracy.
In my opinion this provides a cru-
cial opening for Labour politics and
its leader Ed Miliband. With twenty
months to go until the 2015 general
election his opinion polls are begin-
ning to gain momentum. Despite
many accusations that he is unﬁt to be
the next Prime Minister, he continues
to weather the political storm.
In spite of this one cannot ignore the
severe implications of the Falkirk seat
row regarding Labour’s crucial link
to trade unions. Allegations that the
Unite union recruited upwards of one
hundred members in an eﬀort to in-
stall Katie Murphy as party candidate
resulted in a major rift between La-
bour and Unite. he comments of un-
ion General Secretary, Len McClus-
key, cemented the rift. He announced
that he was, “obliged to uphold the in-
tegrity of Unite and I can no longer do
so on the basis of…Labour…in which I
can place no trust.”
Ed Miliband’s speech at the recent
Labour party conference in Brighton
also sparked controversy. His pledge
to impose two year energy price freez-
es from 2015 to 2017 kick-started a
welcome surge in opinion polls (La-
bour’s UKPR polling average of 39
with respect to the Tory’s 32). Indeed
when commenting to he Guard-
ian the chief executive of Lightsource
Renewable Energy, Mick Boyle, com-
mended Ed Miliband’s eﬀorts to rum-
ble the oligopoly of ‘the big six’.
“We don’t agree with his price-
freezing proposals…but a breakup
will see more investment in the UK,
not less.” Similar sentiments partially
assisted the Labour leader in evading
the anti-business label stamped on
him by the Government. It proved in-
suﬃcient to stave oﬀ the scepticism he
received from many quarters. Many
pragmatists, including students of Im-
perial College London, will be acutely
aware of the projected energy surplus
of the UK (marginal, less than 2%) by
2015/16. Some may even harbour a
grave concern for impending ‘black-
outs’.
In sum, it is Ed Miliband’s evasion of
concrete statistics that may prove to
be the fatal wound to his election cam-
paign. On the ﬂip side his ethics, com-
bined with his academic background,
may prove to be his saving grace. his
was highlighted by the recent slander
of Ralph Miliband (prominent Marx-
ist thinker and father to Ed) by he
Daily Mail. hey released an article
entitled “he man who hated Britain”.
Ken Livingstone and Alistair Camp-
bell (former Director of Downing
Street Communications under Tony
Blair) were among the politicians to
jump to his defence. Ed Miliband’s an-
ger was plain to see in a televised in-
terview with the BBC. It harmonised
with his letter to Labour newsletter
subscribers. He stated,
“his isn’t about me and my fam-
ily – this is about doing what’s right.”
Ross Hawkins, a BBC political corre-
spondent reported that there was no
“sure-ﬁre way of knowing…how many
voters share his outrage.”
For me, it was good to see some
genuine emotion from a politician; if
anything, I found it endearing. Recent
political developments on the global
platform, capped by the shutdown of
the US Government, prove that poli-
tics is a delineated and complex col-
lection of catacombs where an indi-
vidual is hard pushed to adhere to his
or her fundamental principles. his
is an accepted reality and one that
fuelled Ralph Miliband’s pioneering
1972 work ‘Parliamentary Socialism’.
He believed that Labour was rendered
ineﬀective by the conﬁnes of Govern-
ment, forced to adopt increasingly
empirical politics.
Ed Miliband, diﬀering from his fa-
ther by moving towards the centre
left, accepts this empiricism as a good
thing. Time has told us that an indi-
vidual entering politics will always
succumb to compromise and, ulti-
mately, disrepute. If Ed Miliband can
continue to reveal his ethics at a dis-
tance from politics and display genu-
ine concern for the needs of the UK
electorate, Labour opinion polls may
further surge.
