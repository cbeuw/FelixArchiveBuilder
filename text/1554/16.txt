Six Ideas for Trafalgar Squareʼs Fourth Plinth
Arianna Sorba
Arts Editor
he fourth plinth in Trafalgar
Square has been a source of
controversy practically since
the day it was built. After sitting
empty for over 150 years due
to “insufficient funds”, since the
late 1990s it has been home to
some of the most talked-about
contemporary artworks that
Londoners have ever had the joy
(or despair) of witnessing, from
a life-sized ﬁgure of Christ to a
giant ship in a bottle. he Fourth
Plinth Commissioning Group
announced last week the 6 piece
shortlist for the 2015/16 display,
from which two will be selected.
So which is your favourite? Do
you prefer Leckey’s surrealist
structure or Lijn’s dancing duo?
Or perhaps you’d give Shrigley’s
idea the thumbs-up? Visit the

Models of the six proposals are on
show in the crypt of St Martin in the
Fields church in Trafalgar Square

Really Good – David Shrigley
A 10m tall elongated thumbs-up sign,
cast in bronze. What’s not to like?
Really Good is a brilliantly sarcastic
idea from David Shrigley, a
Glaswegian artist known for his
deliberately naive deadpan humour.
Apparently Shrigley hopes that the
sculpture, if made, will become a
self-fulﬁlling prophecy, and “make
Trafalgar Square, London, the
UK and the world a better place”.
But there’s always something a bit
unnerving about aspects of the
human body taken out of proportion
that means it might not be popular.
It’s also possibly, for the younger
generation at least, a bit too ‘Facebook’.
The Dance – Liliane Lijn
TheDanceistheonlyworkinthecurrent
shortlist created by a female artist.
he brainchild of American-born
artist Liliane Lijn, The Dance would
involve two identical aluminium
cones powered by motors, their
sections slowly moving and
rotating towards and away from
each other, as though dancing.
he faux-futuristic materials and slick

to watch these two beings engage with
each other in such a peaceful way.
But there’s some tricky logistics to
consider. For example, what happens
when one cone inevitably breaks
down and – heaven forefend – the
other ends up dancing on his own?
Gift Horse – Hans Haacke
Some critics are calling German-
American artist Hans Haacke’s horse
the most suitable idea, as it references
the statue of William IV astride a
horse that was originally intended for
the fourth plinth all those years ago.
Meanwhile the electronic ribbon
tied in a bow around the horse’s
front leg displays a live ticker of the
London Stock Exchange, bringing the
sculpture ﬁrmly into the 21st century
and turning it into a gift for the nation.
Haacke’s works are often political,
as he examines the relationships
between art, power and money in
his art. It seems this Gift Horse,
with the somewhat grave and
lonely imagery, is no exception.
Unmade Monument – Marcus Coates
he seemingly random rock
formation proposed by Londoner
Marcus Coates is in fact an exact
replica of a stone outcrop that the
artist spotted in Yorkshire. he
outcrop, formed over hundreds of
millions of years by natural processes,
would contrast with the rigid, man-
made stone structures in the square.
Although abstract, it is practically
impossiblenottoseefeaturesorﬁgures
in the rock, as it is human nature to
search for such patterns in an attempt
to make sense of the natural disorder.
he sculpture would be a monument
to creativity and power of nature,
outside of a human context. Or
perhaps it would just be a lump of rock.
Moon Mask – Ugo Rondinone
‘Our connection to other people is
our face. Our alternate self is a mask’,
says Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone.
hat’s why he proposes a giant mask,
modelled by hand, as a universally
recognisable icon for Trafalgar Square.
he mask is intentionally abstract
and basic, with no speciﬁc cultural
references or origins. Viewers are free
to identify any artistic associations or
personal emotions in the mask’s blank
steel face, from African tribal masks,
to Cubist inﬂuences, to their own
individual projections, as they peer
through the window-like apertures.
However this simplicity is also
possibly its greatest failing, as it may
render the structure bland, and rather
uninteresting to view from behind.
Larger Squat Afar – Mark Leckey
For Larger Squat Afar, Turner Prize
winner Mark Leckey has combined
aspects from across Trafalgar Square
to make one single structural entity.
Details from the James II and Admiral
Jellico statues, the central fountain
and the plinth itself have all been
incorporated into the absurdist
design. Even the title is actually
an anagram of Trafalgar Square!
Leckey has often used elements of
collageinhisartwork,butmoreusually
in video and music installations.
However here he has attempted to
create an actual physical structure,
that is visually and emotionally
greater than the sum of its parts.
