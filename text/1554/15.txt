FRIDAY 04 OCT

ost students at
Imperial are men. I
don’t imagine this
comes as much of
a surprise to most
Felix readers. While this gender
imbalance is obvious from the
ﬁrst day of Freshers Week, what it
means and how to talk about it can
be more challenging. Whispered
remarks about “he Ratio” can be
heard on most courses and jokes
abound about the sexual frustration
of Imperial’s males; the straight ones
at least. But beyond this, any serious
discussion of gender among students
can often be dismissed. We can be
pretty poor at talking gender and
it’s we men who seem to do it worst.
he low proportion of women
students at Imperial is not the
College’s fault and in fact when
compared to the science, engineering
and medicine departments in the
rest of the UK, we have slightly more
equal gender ratio than average. his
does not mean, however, that there
is nothing to be discussed. When
posters went up last year in the
chemistry department showing the
proportion of female researchers in
the diﬀerent groups, it was graffitied
with “So? Problem?” Posters inviting
female physics students to a female-
only event were graffitied with
comments calling the event “sexist”.
hese comments are massively
unhelpful and entirely miss the point.
It can be tempting to think that simply
removing legal barriers to female
academics is sufficient to right historic
wrongs. A glance at the progress of
African Americans since the end of
legal segregation in 1954 suggests
otherwise. It is quite right that we
make a particular eﬀort to encourage
schoolgirls to be interested in science
and for women undergraduates
to pursue their subjects further.
When we men are dismissive of
the idea, we serve the status quo.
Last week a mini Twitter storm
broke out over an upcoming science
event in the Excel Arena of Olympic
fame. he event features 6 panelists
including Richard Dawkins and
Bill Bailey, which is a very cool and
original combination. Less original
is the gender makeup of the panel,
all 6 speakers are men. As with
Imperial, it is not the fault of the
organisers if these were genuinely
the best candidates. Where they
messed up was with the FAQ on their
website, which addressed lack of
women. hey said; “I am a fanatical,
misandristic ‘feminist’. May I drone
on about the lack of women in the
line-up and despatch bigoted, mis-
spelt, ungrammatical missives to
the organisers and presenters?” “No.
Please save your talents for Twitter
and Facebook, that’s what they’re
for. We’re actually very disappointed
that none of our female invitees
accepted, but that is just how it was.
As scientists we have no choice but
to accept reality. Wanting something
to be otherwise does not make it so.”
Yes, this is supposed to be
comically exaggerated language
but even ignoring the labelling of
those who complain of the lack of
women speakers as “bigoted” and
“misandristic”, the FAQ’s message is
quite clear; put up and shut up. We
should do neither. It is quite right
and reasonable to wonder why the
organisersfailedtoﬁndasinglewoman
panelist. It may indeed be the case that
they really did try, but this is hardly
the ﬁrst panel event on science to be
all male, and maintaining the status
quo allows a self fulﬁlling prophesy
whereby men gain higher proﬁles
from speaking at events which leads
them to be invited to more events.
It may not be up to this particular
event to “ﬁx” this, but to brush it away
as a non-issue is wilful ignorance.
Men of Imperial, we can do better
than this. To question why the gender
imbalance is as it is not to question
whether any one of us deserves to
be here or to suggest that College
discriminate in favour of women
students and employees. Students
are right to challenge the status quo
and make active eﬀorts to encourage
women scientists in College and
further aﬁeld. Dismissing these
eﬀorts as “sexist” is lazy. he Excel
event told us that “as scientists we
have no choice but to accept reality.”
his is a strange deﬁnition of science.
Rather, as scientists we examine
reality, come to understand how it
works and ﬁnd out how to change it.
Scientists do not simply accept reality.
