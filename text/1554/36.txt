T
here are some common
misconceptions about
networking, such as that it’s
diﬃcult and only works for
charismatic personalities
who are good at schmoozing, or is
basically a back door process for
asking inﬂuential contacts to give you
a job. Wrong. Networking is all about
creating a mutually beneﬁcial web of
relationships, which is transparent,
honest and allows you to reﬁne your
career ideas and help you ﬁnd suitable
opportunities. Simply, it involves
developing your own personal
brand and raising your proﬁle, and
connecting with professionals in your
ﬁeld of interest to learn more about
your sector, career paths, qualiﬁcation
routes and potential vacancies.
Make the most of campus events
Making contact and networking
with employers couldn’t be easier
on campus, where a wide range
of careers talks, skills sessions,
presentations, fairs and forums are
organised by the Careers Service on
a daily basis. Employers are actively
targeting and speciﬁcally interested
in networking with Imperial students:
‘Imperial is one of the top universities
in the country, it makes sense to build
a relationship with students, go to the
careers fairs and presentations, where
those targeted group of students are’
(Luisa Dunn Graduate Recruitment
at Cisco).
It is vital though that students
approach employers in a way that is
both constructive and professional
when attending a careers fair or forum:
‘We recommend that students
do their research and find out
what the companies do so you can
spend your time wisely at the event’
(Emma Britton, Graduate
Recruitment at Citi)
‘It is imperative that you have
questions ready when networking so
that it is obvious to the employer that
you’re interested’
(Steph Ahrens, Graduate Recruitment
at Morgan Stanley)
So, think about the type of
information and insights you’re
hoping to gain, as well as the
impression you want create. Plan
your questions in advance and make
sure present yourself as professional,
conﬁdent, engaged and positive.
It pays to prepare
Always read the programme for an
event as soon as it is available, usually
a week before the event in hard copy
or on the careers website. It will
usually give you some background
information on the companies
attending,whattheydo,whatgraduates
they recruit and into which roles.
It is also a good idea to check out
their website, especially their graduate
careers pages. When approaching a
company representative at a fair it
doesn’t give a great impression if your
opening gambit is “what does your firm
do?” or “so what kind of jobs do you
have?” Getting this basic information
in advance means that when you
do speak to the representatives
you can have a more meaningful
conversation and come away with
the added detail to help you with
any applications. his background
research can also help you to decide
which companies you really want to
target. At very large events it may not
be possible to speak individually to
every company so a “hit list” is a good
idea so that you maximise the time.
On the day
• Remember that ﬁrst impressions
count.
• hink of some questions that you
can ask the company representatives.
• Avoid questions that you should
already know the answers to.
• Remember the company
representatives are often recent
graduates themselves so now is the
ideal time to ﬁnd out what their
experience has been so far, what the
training programme was like, what
support were they give, what is it
really like to do that role, work for
that company etc.
• First impressions also include
appearance so if you are serious about
a company or are in the middle of
an application process with them
it might pay to turn up at the fair
looking smart and presentable.
• Remember fairs are not a
university version of a supermarket
sweep. hey are not organised for
you to see how many freebies you can
grab in the shortest space of time.
• Even if you haven’t started to
actively job hunt you will be surprised
how well recruiters remember names
and faces. Making a good impression
now could make your job hunting
easier in the future.

Imperial College
Alumnus Profile
What did your PhD involve?
Simulations and R&D of a future project (cooling
channel of a Neutrino Factory). I had to learn many
diﬀerent programming languages and softwares. Also
had the chance to participate in other experiments (like
MICE) that were ongoing and thus had the chance to
participate in shifts and work on hardware, in addition to
data analysis
Describe the career path you took to your current
role.
I had my BSci in Physics in Cyprus (that lasts four
years). For my ﬁnal year project I was chosen to go to
Fermilab for a few months and worked on a particle
physics experiment (ﬁnished the project back in Cyprus).
I have no Masters. hen I applied for PhD’s in the US/
UK/Italy and chose to come to Imperial. here we (my
classmates and I) started with MPhil (6 ﬁrst months,
this is why a Masters is not required) and then got into
research. My research partially involved accelerator
physics and partially particle physics. Before the end of
my PhD I started applying for post-doc positions in the
US/UK/EU and was hired as a CERN fellow at CERN (i.e.
I am not aﬃliated with any university). Here I work as an
accelerator physicist on a future project called LAGUNA-
LBNO (i.e. working on R&D and simulations) while at the
same time getting involved with other small projects that
require me to do some shifts and data analysis.
How has what you learnt at Imperial helped you
in your career so far?
During my PhD at Imperial I learnt not to give up no
matter how hard a project seems/is; that I should keep
working until a problem is solved. My self-motivation
skills were improved signiﬁcantly and this had a direct
impact at my work now; many times you feel you are at
a dead-end and you need to ﬁnd ways to get out. Having
a PhD is completely diﬀerent than having a BSci. You
are required to work alone, to come up with ideas, to
be motivated and organised without necessarily having
someone telling you what to do. You don’t have one text
book that you have to study from in order to do well at
the exams. You have to think on your own what steps are
needed to ﬁnd the solution to a problem that has not been
encountered before. he PhD experience in total was very
beneﬁcial as it helps you become stronger, work well as
a team-member and deliver what you are required to by
a speciﬁc deadline. What I learnt that has been the most
useful to me is that no matter how diﬃcult things seem to
be, you have to keep swimming with the head outside the
water and you will (sooner or later) ﬁnd the shore (or a
rock to relax for a bit before starting to swim again).

the sense of working towards a
greater understanding of the world,
empowering other students and
allowing people to create bonds
across international boundaries
is what makes it worthwhile.
