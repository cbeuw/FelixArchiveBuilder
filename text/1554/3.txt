Fisher Halls are Fishy
M

campaign focused
on the impending
closure of Evelyn
Gardens’ Fisher Hall. he huge
campaign lasted months but the plans
to create the halls were continued.
In 2011, the college announced that
the Fisher Hall was no longer required.
his was due to the completion of
Prince’s Gardens halls, which means
that there was a surplus of bed spaces.
As a result, they and the Wellcome
Trust (the owners of the building)
submitted a proposal to convert Fisher
Hall into a care home.
A couple of years later, in 2013,
the college surprised the Union by
announcing that more bed spaces were
now needed as they would be closing
Garden Hall too. To make up this
deﬁcit, they put forward a proposal
to build a 700-bed accommodation-
only campus in North Acton, which is
a 40 minute commute each way from
South Kensington.
he College claimed that it would
cost around £10 million to refurbish
the hall for students, and thus the
conversion into a care home was more
ﬁnancially viable. It is well known
that Fisher Halls’ current state is less
than adequate and could be seen as
unsuitable for the elderly and disabled.
he director of Campus Services,
Jane Neary, told Felix in 2011 that
the reason for the closure was ‘not
that [the hall isn’t] good enough, it’s
completely legal [in terms of upkeep]’,
adding that ‘we’ve done all the urgent
work’.
Upon inspection by an Imperial
student, it was noted that there was
a large area of exposed wiring on
one of the stairwells. A large number
of electrical components did not
appear to have been tested in line
with these regulations. he testing
certiﬁcates indicated that they were
due for testing in August 2012, but as
of June 2013, the certiﬁcates had not
been replaced. Some appliances were
three years past their due date. he
college states that “all college owned
appliances are tested annually and all
wiring is tested every ﬁve years”.
Asbestos is another concern in
Fisher hall. A second year Physicist
explains that he is uncomfortable with
the asbestos-ﬁlled ﬁre doors. “You
push them and they bang against the
wall and then hit you in the face” he
says, explaining that he’s not sure that

the asbestos is safe in doors which
receive such strong knocks and are
damaged in places.
In addition, the lack of central
heating means that many of the
rooms are heated with wall-mounted
fan heaters, which are past their PAT

not currently unsafe despite the date
having passed. All circuits and fuse
boards are scheduled to be tested this
term, and any remedial work will be
carried out as required.
Fixed appliance testing was carried
out in Fisher hall in September 2012,
including on the wall mounted heat-
ers shown in picture 2. he next test
is due later this month. It appears that
the heaters have not been stickered
correctly. Imperial’s electrical con-
tractors now tend to keep electronic
records/registers rather than apply
stickers, which tend to fall oﬀ. he
accommodation team should have ar-
ranged for old stickers to be removed,
however.
here were a number of telephone
junction boxes in the Hall that are re-
dundant (photo 6). hese have already
been removed or are in the process of
being removed, as per picture 4.
Damage to the window frame pic-
tured is due to condensation. Accom-
modation staﬀ continue to monitor
the situation and students with any
concerns can contact their Hall Su-
pervisor if they have any concerns.
Similarly damage to the ceiling, as
shown in one of the photographs, was
due to a defect on the roof, allowing
water through. hat defect has been
ﬁxed, the peeling paint removed and
the accommodation team are closely
monitoring it.

hot to the touch and when left on,
smell distinctly smoky and are even
reported to have set oﬀ the ﬁre
alarms. Sometimes, they tend to fail
in the winter, which leaves the room
at a temperature below the 20°C that
the college states halls will be kept at
whilst occupied.
When a Hall Supervisor inspected

sub-par room was the origami birds
hanging from the ﬁre tube. She stated
that they were ‘very dangerous’ and
‘must be removed immediately’. All
other serious issues with the room
went by unnoticed.
In addition to not adhering to the
college’s promises on electrical safety,
Fisher Hall currently presents a poorly
kept environment for students to live
in and is a completely diﬀerent image
from the immaculate rooms in Prince’s
Gardens that are shown to prospective
students on Open Days.
