The Roseberry Clip is onoe again in the possession of I.C.
a A.C. who won ( the University Athletic Championship at
Motspur Park on May 9th. This brings the Cup to I.C. for
the: sixth tima in eight years.
Entries for the championship had to be sent in two days
after the beginning of term, which gave the selection com-
mittee l i t t l e tim«, to judge the potentialities of individ-
uals. However, they did a good job.
Our first success was on 5th May when W.Robartson won the
two miles Steeplechase, after overtaking D.JJPain (I.C.)
on the last bend, in the record time of lCmins. 34.8 sees.
A great performance.
IH.Riekardi retained his title in the high jump, and G.C.
Kay was unfortunate in having to run a very fast half mile
•which was won by Roger Bannister in Im 55.3seos. A new I.C
record was set up by H.Pinsent in the 440 vards hurdles.

As"sboh~as T saw'the fooliprints' ^ r e a l i s e d t h a t "
those abominable showmen the 29 Club had struck again.
My suspicions were confirmed on f i n d i n g a cardboard
s t e n c i l , cut in'the shape o f a f o o t , i n the n o t i c e -
board frame outside the door of the Union, f o r the num-
ber 29 was w r i t t e n on i t . Following *Che f o o t p r i n t s , I
discovered that they l e d through the Beit Arch, across
a corner o f the tennis court (without impediment by the
wire n e t t i n g ) down i n t o the Botany basement, and up the
v e r t i c a l w a l l o f the Union, over the roof, down again,
up and on to the road by Queen Alexandra's House.
"Readers may remember that the 29 Club s p e c i a l i z e i n
p a i n t i n g and decorating. They made headlines i n FELIX
l a s t term when we reported how, a t the end o f the Autumn
Term, they handle-barred the s t u f f i n g i n the lower dining
h a l l , and painted the l i g h t s on the A l b e r t Steps. One
suspects that they are a rare form of l u n a t i c s operating
only at term ends."
The FELIX reporter who deals with 29 Club a c t i v i t i e s
would l i k e to scotch any rumours that on account o f t h i s
strenuous, p u b l i c i t y campaign f o r the Club, he has been
elected to honorary membership. He consequently has no
i n s i d e information, and would welcome any that may be
a v a i l a b l e .
A r c h e o l o g i s t s and others may note that traces o f
the i m p r i n t s are s t i l l v i s i b l e on the w a l l of the Union
f a c i n g the A l b e r t H a l l , where they have been e x c i t i n g
considerable speculation among' music l o v e r s and boxing
fans.

I.C.W.S.C. returned triumphant from the University
Athletic Championships on May 9th. with two cups, the
Imperial College Challenge Cup and the Sherwood Cup.Tiis
latter cup i s awarded on a proportional basis, the num-
ber of points awarded to a team being divided by the
number in the college.
Under the captaincy of Janet Findlater the I.C. team
performed extremely well. The field events'competitors,
on form after their efforts under the supervision of
coach Margaret Evenett, produced some creditable results,
in spite of having to practice on the Rector's Lawn. In
the track eventa J.Findlater was the star for I.C., but
I.C.W.S.C. are to be congratulated on putting up such a
S t i r l i n g performance.

ill. L. MOUNTAINEERING OTTO MEET GLEN TORRIDON
While the South was suffering a wet Easter, the h i l l s
of Torridon with summits clother i n show were bathed i n
sunlight with only a few lazy clouds above thenu_
The base for a c t i v i t i e s was I n v e r a l l i g i n Youth Hostel,
run by the v i l l a g e shopkeeper who only v i s i t e d the hostel
Itwice i n our stay of one week, and unlike English wardens
didn't mind what form of transport was used to get there...
The hostel i s right above an arm of the sea, but mountains
surnund^it on a l l sides. Four mountains are within roanh
if_the once-dailv bus i s used. .
'Behind the hostel i s Ben A l i i g i n "jhich rises from the sea.
to 3000' and i s very steep except where broken by a corrio.
The summit ridge i s quite sharp i n places, but better was
to come. From the top the Cuillens of Skye hod an almost
alpine appearance aid the Outer Hebrides seemed very close.
if'fo.e'most famous peak i n the d i s t r i c t i s Liathach which
rises at the head of the Loch and has a' ridge about five
miles long, broken by a se•"^s of pinnacles which provided
a l i t t l e t r i c k y scrambling with most holds hidden by loose
snow. The base of the mountain i o sandstone but i t i s
capped with quartzite. After climbing on the soft rock
i t was rather a surprise to find that oar boot nails wouldn't,
hold just anywhere. The ridge ends very abruptly i n bands
of c l i f f , and careful route finding was necessary to get
down. _
~~ Ben Eigh provided an even longer ridge covered i n deep
new snow. From the top we seemed to be surrounded by nothing
but sea, mountains and snow.
Four mountains was the sum of a week's mountaineering -
not much? But enough.
