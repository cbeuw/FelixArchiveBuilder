Dear Sir,
The Union Library "would like to record i t s
appreciation of the unusually fine collection of books on .
music, ballet and opera that i t received this Easter from
the Centenary Appeal Fund and Touchstone Committee. It is
hoped that a l l at the college who are interested in music
will visit this section of the Union Library and make good
use of i t . May I remind those«who are not already members
of the Library that i t is situated at the far end of the
City and Guilds Library, that membership is free and that
books may be borrowed at any time.
Yours faithfully,
G.J.Hills
Union Librarian.

Dear Sir,
These last few weeks have brought unmistakable signs'
of the possibility of a continued peace. But we must j1
realise that this may be a last chance, and i t certainly
will remain an unfulfilled chance unless we ourselves
take fresh heart. Most will wonder what students can do
that i s not already being done for us by the British
Government; and there is one simple answer. This
Summer we have a unique opportunity: on August the 4th
World Youth Festival is being celebrated in Bucharest,
the capital.of Rumania. Students and young people from
every country in the world will be holidaying together,
will be watching and participating in the folk-dancing,
singing and dramatics and also competing in the World
University Games. There will be performances by inter
nationally famed artists and the Czech wonder Zatopek ie
to run in several invitation races.
Is i t not possible for us to send a delegation from
I.C.. composed of representatives of the various social
and sports clubs? Let us not be put off by our ever
I present cynics; there is no bar to anybody of any
religious belief or political party: everybody who does
not want war is welcome! For those interested further
information can be obtained from the present writer or
from, members of the Festival Committee which is soon to
be established in the College.
Yours sincerely, Bryan Bowes.

In the last month i t has been almost impossible
to open a newspaper without being confronted with an
article or leader on the new hope of a peaceful world.
But can a l l the world's peoples become united, ever,
by one creed? Marxism? Scientific Humanism?
Christianity?
These are

I . C . D E B A T E S
'Tnat Science t Technology do n-t constitute University
. e d u c t i o n i n i t s fullest sense" was debated i n the Oya on
Thursday, 4th. Two m-theno.ticians were the proposer and
opposer, and stated t h e i r c-ses f a i r l y orecisol- .
Frofescor Semple of Kina'c proposed tha npticn- lie
started by pointing out that science i s only one f i e l d of
hu.ian knowledge; and anyone concentrating on science and
technology loses touch with the other'fielda of knowledge.
Ke thinks only of concrete thi.ncrs, and looes liis; seioe of '
values which i s so essential to f u l l education. He gave
as an example h i s own stay at Cambridge, where students of
a l l faculties lived, ate and talked -together; e.nd how he
was f a r more interested i n and instructed by h i s friends
from the arts side than from the science side. Replying
to people who quoted the Industrial Revolution as their
argument, he said that i t was started by scientific advances,
and brought on many evils such as child labour. It was
not until people - non-scientists - insisted that such
conditions cannot go on that an improvement was brought
' abouj? The soientist today has the means of producing
enormous power.. But he has no control over i t . Today
more than ever, he should have the judgment to see that
his labours are not put to dangerous use. The scientist
must develop his sense of values, and ha cannot do this by
learning only science and technology. He therefore i s
not fully educated.
Professor Levy opposed. There i s no reason, he said,
why a scientist should not have knowledge of as wide a
variety of subjects as any other person. A really
deep scientific study of any object - Professor Levy's
pipe for example - will need knowledge of a considerable
number of other things. Science, taught properly, will
also teach the student to think of thines like the men who
made the oipe, the country from which i t s wood came, and so
on. A science student carries out an experiment, ana gets
some results. He then proceeds to generalise the result,
even as we identify ourselves with a character in a novel.
His generalization i s true only over a certain rai ge. To
determine that range, he needs judgement and a sense otr values.
A scientist, furthemore. seeks only truth, in fact he dare
not t e l l a lie: and truth i s a value. The fully educated
; man is one whose pattern of knowledge and pattern el values
fit together. A person cannot be a scientist unless he
iB human in the first place; scientists and humans 8rS*not
two different races. The senses of value and judgment
developed in the laboratory are applied in the world because
their holder i s the same person, whether he i s invide a lab-
oratory or outside i t . A orooer trslninK in science and
tecnnology^does therefore moan a f u l l education.
Mr. A. Peacock, supporting, pointed out how an average'
science student comes to his lectures and goes back from
them too tired for anything else, thus losing a l l touoh with
other things. Scientists in b i g firms were always in the
back" rooms, not in the Board rooms, for they cannot express
themselves. The leaders were politicians who.after a l l ,
are only people who1
can-speak well.
Mr. Just said thst i t depends entirely on the student
whether he is fullv educated or not. In(London in particular,
one can satisfy any interest or curiosity one nay have. ^
The three years of intensive training in one field wmm-
essential in anyone who wanted to find a DrotfeT place in the
world.
Speeches from the floor wertj, mainly in opposition to
the motion. It was pointed out that scientists were in
:
the Board rooms in other countries, & that UKJ has far sore
officers from the scienoe side than from the arts. The votiSk
was seven for, sixteen against, four abstentions. Many
people had left before the debate finished, for i t was getting
late. The time, 5.15 p.m., was obviously not suited to
ia number of people who were probably too tired for anything
iBlse after their lectures and lab. work. Nevertheless,
Professor Levy is understood to have remarked that th«
ifloor speeches were of.'4a*-highest standard he had ever heard.

"Get your hammers, get your maps
Bring your crayons and water proof caps".
So went the cry, Easter was here
ffe must a l l go for the Geology tour.
"How for a week of sunshine hale (we said)
Now f o r walks o'er h i l l and vale",
r The leader was happy, our s p i r i t s high
We reached the place with a happy sigh.
We started our walks, then came the r a i n s
with a wind so nasty, i t c h i l l e d our veins.
The leader just s a i d ' " I t ' s not very nice
"But never mind that, observe t h i s gneiss.
"Look f o r f o s s i l s i n a shaly p l a c e ,
"And when you f i n d one put i t i n a case".
And so i t went for a couple of days
T i l l we saw through the geological haze.
Don't take i t hard, that's the rub
Hang on a b i t t i l l you come to a pub.
At night there's beer, cards or s k i t t l e s ,
As the wind outside screams and whistles.
So the week passes, we know the rocks
It remains for Ma to darn our socks.
If my report's rotten and I f a i l i n June,
1*11 go back there', none too soon.
For (shah'.) there's gold i n them thar h i l l 3 '
Which i s more than enough to pay ray b i l l 3 .
