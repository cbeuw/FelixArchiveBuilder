FELIX
I . C A . F . C I N GERMANY.
It was with sons trepidation that the party of sixteen
soocer player® descended frori the t r a i n at Kalsoheuren
station on the 27th. March. For most of the party i t was
t h e i r f i r s t journey abroad, and there was considerable
apprehension over the problem of language d i f f i c u l t i e s .
However ,these thoughts quiokly passed from our heads when
w* were confronted by a battery of Press photographers on
the platform, A second party was awaiting our a r r i v a l out-
Bids the station. These were the schoolchildren, who had
been given a special holiday for'the occasion. The formal
welcome by the Burgomeieter cants l a t e r , and we were a l l
assigned t o our separate lodgings. At t h i s point soma faces
began to wear worried loots when i t was realised that no
oae spoke English. This state of a f f a i r s was reversed later
•Bfeon everyone was conversing i n tongues ranging from Latin
to 'Osordie'. Above the conversational buss could be heard
Brian Hitohen conversing animatedly i n German "Ja-ja",
"Neia-nsin".
The team, not being used to f a t i n g and feting lost t h e i r
f i r s t game, against S.C.Kalsoheuren, by 3-0 ,the only
exouss being that we oould not adept ourselves to the
• n p l a t i " . Most teams i n Germany play on ash pitches, the
surfecss of which are very similar to running tracks,
makes i t impossible to slide-tackle. In spite of t h i s the
large, crowd was given a good display of football. Afterwards
there wa« the usual drinking session, and Schnapps, bier and
Cltronen-Ms produce wonderful effects.

the VFL 99 Club i n Cologne and mention 'Boomalaka' they w i l l
be made extremely welcome. (An I.C. warcry i s needed.)
Our l a s t and most important game was played against a top'
class amateur League side. Unfortunately the I.e. defence
seemed to have an attack of 'Wembley nerves*: i n miniature
and consequently- we were three goals damn, l a So tie5s»
Gradually our confidence returned and the score rose t»
3-3- mainly due te • some good work by Dave Clenshaw. The
crowd was now brought to i t s feet and every I.C. attack
was cheered madly. Alas, disaster came i n the f«.r» of a
lucky goal and we were humbled to a 6-3 defeat $n the
near darkness.
In spite o i our two reverses the tour was an imafSSise
oose, and we f e e l sure that any future I.C. soccer te
w i l l be warmly welcomed i n the Rhineland.

I.C. Ist. XI, although very strong on paper, were heavily
defeated in t h e i r f i r s t two matches mainly owing to some
spineless batting. There followed a d i s t i n c t improvement
against Westminster College and Hillingdon,botb of whom
would have been defeated but f o r one or two f i e l d i n g lapses
.The bowling has been steady and aggressive, especially
that of Reynolds, whose eight wickets were a l l cleanebowled.

The second XI (three draws, ono win) are a well balanCED
team and scored a good victory over Reading University.
They should have a good season.
The Sunday XI began, i n glorious sunshine, with a victory
over Old Camdenians. Some furious Reynolds bowling, with
K.Weale allowing few chances through at f i r s t s l i p , f o l l -
owed by aggressive batting from Oldland and Reynolds, won
the day f o r I.C.

Th> Head-of-the-Kiver was roved on the last Saturday of
term i n very troublesome conditions of wind with water, and,
as can be seen from the chart, the achievement of the f i r s t
Eight i n coming Fourth was w e l l supported by great improvements
i n the positions of a l l but two of the eight I.C. entries.
The three lower boats swapped places with each other and
kept well away from the t a i l ai d the f i f t h eight were an
unashamedly unfit crew capable of better things. The position
of the F i r s t and Second crews are sufficient good comment
on t h e i r rowing. The Second eight have since won Juniors
at Putney regatta on May 2nd and i n t h e i r f i r s t race as
Junior Seniors, at Hammersmith a week l a t e r , lost by h a l f
a length to the winners. The F i r s t eight competed i n fsnall
(boats i n these two regattas, and are now going into training
for a probable f i r s t appearmce i n the senior eights at
Chiswick reaatta.
At Hammersmith the p a i r won i n fine s t y l e , though on
both occasions the s c u l l e r s were outclassed; but the Four,
despite t h e i r short time tdgwther i n the boat, came near

when i t i s considered that the fines* teams from t h i s co-
untry and the Continent compete i n t h i s f e s t i v a l . London
remained undefeated after four gamesj drawing f i r s t of a l l

Old England.

and throughout the London side a high l e v e l of confidence
and competence. They were, i n fact, a team a l l much on
a par, and f o r t h i s reason i t would be unfair to single
out any particular player". However, a grave injustice
would he done i f ao mention was made of G. Gillfftt who has
