In t h i s issue there appears information about two con-
ferences to be held this summer.Ono of them i s clearly en-
t i t l e d 'Peace' and the other, the author of the l e t t e r i n -
forms us, concerns peace without the inverted commas. ( I t ,
i s i n fact a f e s t i v a l , not a conference i n the strictest
sense.) Both are good examples of seriously planned, w e l l -
organised events which invite a l l interested students t o
participate i n them. Bodies of students i n I.C. are ready
to support them, and are asking a l l others to do the same.
/ Now i t i s usual for I.C. clubs and Societies to send
delegates to the relevant meetings, for those bodies are
recognised representatives of that particular a c t i v i t y i n
I.C. But for conferences of a wider nature, those that con-
cern the student body as a whole and not any particular
a c t i v i t y , no delegation should be labelled as that of I.C.
without the o f f i c i a l support of the Union. Beyond a d e f i -
nite detachment from the I.U.S., t h e i r Congresses(the one
thia year i s being held i n Warsaw) and other a c t i v i t i e s ,
there seems to be no fixed policy i n these matters. Not
that i t i s a simple matter, for no one oan f o r e t e l l who
i f going to organise something and-invite students' sup-
port. When there i s no definite Union backing, l t i s best'
that we think twice before joining something as students
of Imperial Collage.
There was some disappointment and a l i t t l e surprise on
the non-appearance of HELIX last Friday. Wa apologise f o r
eur ever-snooting,,but i t was done i n order that we may
report Coronation and Sports Days i n f u l l , and not too late,
iirtthout diarupting our usual onee-a-fortnight time-table.
Our next w i l l be the both issue, which we hope to make a
buoper. number. Send your fun-boqbs to ue as soon as possi-
ble,, and definitely before next Friday.

..Robin Bray r e t i r e d from h i s job aa E d i t o r of FELIX
at the end of the l a s t term. He has p e r s i s t e n t l y
refuted to be p r o f i l e d , but we cannot l e t him escape
unnoticed. To the FELIX people he was known mainly f o r
hie spontaneous poems, h i s s p e l l i n g , h i s punctuality on
Sundays, unpunctuality on Mondays, and f o r h i s long
h a i r - though the l a s t i s f a i r l y common among F e l i c i a n a .
He could and did write about everything, from terse verse:
to the U.L. debate on abortion. Although h i s excuse for
r e t i r i n g was that t h i s i s h i s l a s t year i n I.C.,we'd Hke
to see him around next year aa a Post Graduate, giving
the l i e t o h i s own statement that our P.G.'s are
notorious f o r t h e i r lack of i n t e r e s t i n Union a f f a i r s .

I f you have ever thought of helping FELIX i n any
way, do i t now. Many members of the s t a f f w i l l be
leaving I.C. a t the'end of the term, and new members w i l l
need a l i t t l e t r a i n i n g - e s p e c i a l l y the Productior
Manager and the Sports E d i t o r - t o get them ready f o r
next year. Jobs on the production side need no previous
experience of any kind. Drop a note t o the E d i t o r , or
come along t o Committee Room A on any Monday a t about
1.30, i f only to make enquiries. Remember, work f o r
FELIX can be arranged t o s u i t everybody's convenience,
and does not take nearly as much time as i t i s reputed
to. J o i n NOW.

There have been several U.L. newspapers before, and
the l a s t one, " U n i v e r s i t y " packed up two years ago, a f t e r
running f o r a year on meagre support. I t never sold
w e l l i n I.C.; i t was poor^competition f o r FELIX. This
r a i s e s a fundamental problem, as f a r as the proposed
p u b l i c a t i o n i s concerned. FELIX provides I.C. with most
of the U n i v e r s i t y news that i t s readers want t o know,
but i t cannot be denied that there are large gaps i n
matters which most of our people never hear about. The
goings-on a t Senate House seldom reach us except v i a the
o f f i c i a l notice-boards, which are not often scanned.
In these matters, and i n others, a U n i v e r s i t y newspaper
might help us. In p a r t i c u l a r , Sport.
The present plan f o r the new paper i s that i t s h a l l
appear weekly, and w i l l probably be sold a t 2d. I t w i l l
be newsprint, s t a r t i n g w i t h eight pages about "Evening
Standard" s i z e . I t w i l l have s t a f f i n a l l the c o l l e g e s
of the U n i v e r s i t y , and a paid a s s i s t a n t a t a c e n t r a l
o f f i c e i n Woburn Square, or thereabouts.
This i s a large conception; but i t i s no l a r g e r
than many which have become outstandingly s u c c e s s f u l ,
notably the Cambridge newspaper " V a r s i t y " . But "Varsity1
'
has a tremendous advantage; i t does not have t o compete
with i n d i v i d u a l college newspapers. This i s where the
Plan comes i n .
FELIX must f i n i s h . I n l i n e with the other c o l l e g e
newspapers of U.L. he must Tiake way g r a c e f u l l y f o r a
greater cause. We have seen i n the past that a Uni-
v e r s i t y newspaper has no chance against a home product
containing the cream o f our own news. I f the informa-
t i o n now p r i n t e d f o r t n i g h t l y by FELIX appeared weekly i n
a f a r more s o p h i s t i c a t e d p u b l i c a t i o n , s u r e l y we would be
s a t i s f i e d .
Why not keep FELIX and buy the other as w e l l ? We
know from the past that the contents of the other would
s u f f e r , because of the claims of FELIX on our w r i t e r s ,
and we would not buy the U n i v e r s i t y newspaper i s l a r g e
numbers. And a newspaper of the contemplated s i z e and
scope i s only p r a c t i c a b l e with a c i r c u l a t i o n not smaller
than f i v e thousand - the t o t a l c i r c u l a t i o n of the current
college newspapers.
We must obviously act i n step w i t h the othe c o l l e g e s ,
i f we act a t a l l : i t would be p o i n t l e s s f o r FELIX t o -
pack up i f " P i " , "Kings News" and "Beaver" s t i l l f l o u r i s h -
ed, e s p e c i a l l y since we are alone i n not running at a
l o s s .
There are b i g objections t o my plan. I t may be
t h a t , deprived of the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of producing a com-
p l e t e newspaper, the I.C. correspondents of the new
pap«£ would lose i n t e r e s t and become u n w i l l i n g c o l l e c t o r s
of u n e n t h u s i a s t i c a l l y w r i t t e n news. A l s o , i f FELIX
ceased p u b l i c a t i o n and the U.L. paper f a i l e d we would be
i n a Bess.
These and other problems need debating and c l a r i f y -
ing. But they should be considered s e r i o u s l y i n the
l i g h t of a concrete proposal f o r the r e s u r r e c t i o n of the
U n i v e r s i t y newspaper. I suggest, with the kind permis-
sion of the E d i t o r , that you should make known t o FELIX
your views on the matter. I f there appears t o be sup-
port f o r the plan, I propose t o run a survey to i n v e s t i -
gate the true f e e l i n g i n I.C.
