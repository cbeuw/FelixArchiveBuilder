PROFILE
M . J . N E A L E .
This year's Chairman of the Social Glubs Committee i s
one of the few postgraduates who have taken their degree,
elsewhere and yet take a full and aotive part i n the l i f e
at I.C, He freely admits that the Ph.D. he i s attempting
with a chromium plated device i n the basement of Solids
is only a sideline to his main object which i s to get the
fullest benefit from a true University education i n London.
Kike was born in Hampstead i n December 1926 and h i s
education was achieved between 1939 and 1943 at St. Edwards
School, Oxford. When 16 he wont to Rolls-Royce as an app-
rentice taking a first class degree at Derby Tech. in his
•para time, and being elected a Whitworth scholar.
After he same of age he was put onto flight testsofc-
, serving with carburettor developement as his main interest.
Ha developed one to such an extent that tha engine ground
to n h»Tt at the crucial moment. Fortunately there were
three ethera and the pilot brought him safely home.
Thi« period of Indoctrination with the Rolls-Royce nas
bora* fruit in hie insistence that i f a thing looks right
it i s right. Hia apparatus ia well wetth a visit, being
the very opposite of the strong and Bortik research which
most of us know. It gleams and the screw heads are cunni-
ngly arranged to aet off the pressure guages to their best
advantage. We do not know whether i t works or not but i t
should be the stock exhibit for distinguished visitors for
year* to come.
Ittke has bean in charge of the Gliding Club Transport
for the last two years during which he has transformed the
very peer material inte a highly effioient unit. One exam-
ple Is tha stripped-down armoured ear which was parked out-
aide the Union about a week ago. He was Captain of the
GlidiaRiflBb last year and when he can be dragged from the
workshop ha flies one of the aallplaaea. We hopo he may
be flying in the National Championships this year.
Mike heo handled the S.C.C. buainess well this year
and will go on record as the Chairman of the shortest
meeting in recent yearn— s
» minutes. I f we can get laore of
hie ilk to take an Interest In Union affairs especially
when the expansion of the postgraduate aide takes place
• we shall have nothing to worry .about.
R . C . S . S M O K I N G C O N C E R T
When we are o l d and d i s t i n g u i s h e d we may ex-
perience f e e l i n g s akin to pride on returning to
College to have a look round, and d i s c o v e r i n g that
some o f the t r a d i t i o n s we founded are s t i l l
f l o u r i s h i n g . Writing as one who vas at the f i r s t
Booking Concert, I f e e l that h i s t o r y has already
east a halo of reverence over my head. I look
forward to the time when, as I s h u f f l e along the
embankment, people w i l l make way and whisper, "He
Was a t the f i r s t R.C.S. Smoking Concert."
I wear my mantle of greatness l i g h t l y , f o r I
am s t i l l young, and besides, I am used to i t f o r I
was a t the f i r s t Harllngton Bonfire as w e l l (and
at the l a s t one on the Rector's lawn, when strong
men wept that an age-old t r a d i t i o n should c e r l s h
so f r i v o l o u s l y ) .
Doubt not M a t the R.C.S. Smoking Concert has
>ecome, l i k e Bonfire Night, Morphy Day and M e l d
Cup Day a notable occasion i n the l i f e of the
College, and i f you were here on the l a s t Monday
of l a s t term you w i l l understand why.
Most o f the turns involved some sort of sing-
l i n g , ranging from the pare notes of the greater
Wardlegales ("Yoho you drunkards; yoho you drunk-
ards; yoho, heaveho") to a charming b a l l a d by
Col. Lowrey, v i a a l l sorts of unmentionable things.
There were s e v e r a l sketches i n c l u d i n g a parody on
"what's My Line", e n t i t l e d "Elucidate My Occupa-
t i o n " , i n which Q-.B. Cotton-Thomas caused some
consternation by p l a y i n g g o l f b a l l s and lumps of
t u r f a t the audience. A radio play f o r children,
•Seduction", was the most elaborate and the most
s u c c e s s f u l turn of the evening, and i t s l i f e - a c d -
• o u l . Vers Atkinson ( a l i a s Captain Slashlnjug)
deserves our congratulations.
Throughout a l l these mafflckinge the audience
was by no means quiet. Beer was being swallowed
at a Niagara-rate, and there were signs of rowdy-
ism that would have been out of place almost any-
where except i n a Smoking Concert. Thus, l t came
as a s u r p r i s e , at the height of the h l l a r i ^ u s n e e a ,
to see Bon Macfie march on to the platform, a
recorder clutched f i r m l y i n h i s hand, and d e l i v e r
himself of a d e l i g h t f u l period work, which went on
for s e v e r a l minutes i n a gym that was otherwise
completely s i l e n t . Whether l t was surprise or
sheer rapture which d i d the t r i c k I know not, but
L i o n Tamer Daniel has nothing on our Bon. Pete
LIley attempted a s i m i l a r "tour" a l i t t l e l a t e r ,
but the boys were awake again by then. S*H»>

A welcome feature: the QuiIds were present.
Three o f them stood up there, Just In front of
thousands of raving savages and sang a song which
ended
:»We>ve won the Technology, Cup from you
And we're going to win the Sparkes Cup, too."
Tha r e s t r a i n t shown by the gentlemen (and l a d i e s ! )
of R.C.S. was admirable.
Another Oulldsman, Joe Lockyer, abetted John
Harding i n a group of the c l a s s i c "Western" songs.
Using material from the Qui Ids and R.C.S. Carni-
v a l s , they scored t h e i r usual h i t .
This entente, new to Smoking Concerts, i s a
good thing. Perhaps the day w i l l come when the
I.C. Smoking Concert appears, or when the long
awaited, much debated I.C. Review i s given.
W® have the talent, and we have the enthusi-
asm. A l l we need i s time. This column would

Conoert) i n a huddle with the Dramatic Society
Chiefs and the entertainments bosses of Mines and
Guilds. The best time f o r an I.C. Review i s the
Autumn Term, but the time to plan i t Is now, so
that script writers, the most elusive of the
a r t i s t e required, may have the long vacation to
io t h e i r work.
