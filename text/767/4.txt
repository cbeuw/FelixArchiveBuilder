Who cares wins
and was critical of the election rules
in general. He stressed that both he
and Mr Howgate had not broken the
spirit of the rules, and that, by
upholding Mr Manuel's objection, the
committee was giving more credence
to the letter of the law, rather than to
the interpretation of them by the
sabbatical officers. No set of rules
could take account of every
eventuality, he explained. Mr
Goodwin said that he would consider
running again if the electioin had to
be repeated.
In the election for Hon Sec, Chas
Jackson polled 447 votes to win,
ahead of Symon Corns who polled
299, with 229 abstentions. In the
contest for FELIX Editor the voting
was: Judith Hackney 509, Chris
Edwards 376, abstentions 60.
The elections will be formally
announced at the Results UGM on
Thursday. There will also be elections
for the major non-sabbatical Union
officers.

No headline required
Dave Tyler (Chem Eng III) was
elected President of Guilds Union at
the UGM today, with over twice as
many votes as his closest rival
Tracey-Ann Hall (Civ Eng I). The
other candidates, Alastair Seymour
(Elec Eng II) and Simon Childs (Aero
II) trailed close behind with third and
fourth positions.
The election took place in Mech
Eng 220 before an audience of about
300 exhilarated students who jeered,
cheered and heckled in response to the
candidates' lively speeches.
An election for HJT also took place
which saw Gehan de Silva (Civ Eng
II) beat Colin Trotman (Mech Eng II)
by 138 votes to !04 with 40
abstentions.
The other posts in Guilds Exec next
year are held by: VP Chris Simpson
(Chem Eng II), Hon Sec Alan Hepper
(Mech Eng II), Ents Murray
Williamson and Stuart Brooks (both
Mech Eng I), Publicity Officer Dave
Osborne (Mech Eng I) OC's Rep
Clare Lupton (Mech Eng II).
The post of Academic Affairs
Officer is still open to candidates.
The Guildsheet Editors for next
year are Alison Dewey (Elec Eng I)
and Dave Hudson (Elec Eng III)
returned unopposed.
A source within Guilds commented
that the elections weren't quite as
highly contested or eagerly attended
as in previous years, but nevertheless
seemed to be fairly run and contested.
The source also stated that it was felt
the highlight of the meeting was VP-
elect Chris Simpson's acceptance
speech which featured him baring his
bottom to the electorate.
Land's end to London run
In order to support the National Deaf
Children's Society Imperial College
Relay Team is organising an
outstanding event:
"A non-stop run from Land's
End to the heart of London"
On Friday March 20th 1987, a team
of men and women will set off from
Land's End to run day and night until
London is reached, covering over 600
kilometers.
Swapping runners every 10
kilometers, each team member will
cover a total of 60 kilometers in 6
laps. Running at an average speed of
10 km/h, each lap will take one hour
allowing nine hours rest between
them.
Leaving early Friday morning, the
team will run through major cities
such as Plymouth, Exeter,
Bournemouth and Winchester to end
in Trafalgar Square, London, by
Sunday evening.

Congratulations but no prizes to all of you who noticed the error in
last week's competition—yes, Rag Fete is on Saturday May 9th, not
May 8th, as printed. Because of the unusual FELIX schedule at the
end of term we will not be giving the answers to last week's questions
until the last issue before Easter (Wednesday 18th). The answers to
today's question, and to the third set, which will be printed next
Wednesday, will be given in the first issue of next term. Please get
answers to both sets of questions to the FELIX office by 1.30pm on
Monday April 27th. Remember that the overall winner will have a
choice of weekends in Paris or Amsterdam, and that there are £10
prizes each week to the first correct entry drawn from a hat.
This week's questions are;
1) What part of College is this?
2) Who was the first President of IC Union?
