Howgate: Why I withdrew
Over last weekend 1 went around the
halls asking students whether the\
were aiming to \ote. abstain or not
vote at all.
The results 1 came up with,
combined w ith the calls I have heard
when canvassing votes suggests to me
that there was a reasonable chance
that abstains could win in the
Presidential election. The abstain
campaign was organised in such a
way that neither Bill nor I were given
the time to fight it. or allowed to
speak out against it. I would at this
point like to protest to the election
committee for allowing this to take
place at such short notice although I
understand that their hands were tied.
It is m\ opinion that the students are
unaware of what a detrimental effect
such a result or even just such a
campaign can have. At present this
College is overrun by apathy; a vote
of apath\ (which this would be)
merely reduces the support, strength
anj ability of the Union to motivate
students into events and standing up
for themselves. A win for abstain
would mean that the election would
have to be rerun approximately 5—6
weeks (note, this is very close to
exams) into next term: any candidate
likely to stand would either know very
little about the Union and hence be
incapable of doing such a pressure job
as President, or did not have the guts
or commitment to stand the first time
(obviously not presidential material).
Bill and I would be in no position to
stand again having already been
rejected once. The impression I get
is that many students have decided to
abstain either because they do not
know either candidate (unfortunately
we are not omnipresent) or because
it is a trendy thing to do.
Seeing that abstains could win
(partialis my own fault for not
anticipating this possibility and hence
taking the campaign too lightly) and
know ing what harm it would do to the
Union and the students I have decided
to stand-down, effectively stopping
the possibility of this and handing the
job oxer to Bill Goodwin. Having
spent a lot of this year fighting for.
working for. and representing the
students in this College I felt it was
hypocritical for me to allow even the
chance of this happening. 1 stood for
this post (whether Dave Jones
believes it or not) because 1 felt I was
the best person for the job and could
do the most for the students. I would
have stood down had a better
candidate appeared or I had been able
to persuade someone I felt was better
to stand. Although I do not feel Bill
Goodwin is a better candidate than I,
he does know a lot about the way the
Union runs and how it might be
improved (even if he stood as a joke
candidate) because he has been news
editor and an active student and hence
would do a competent job and at least
be better than any person who stood
after an abstention vote. I also feel Bill
has his heart in the right place. I
would now like to apologise to. and
thank all my friends and supporters
for all they have done in vain: they
know who they are: and say sorry for
disappointing anyone who was going
to vote for me. Finally I wish Bill and
the Union the best of luck and success
next year.
Yours regretfully,
Ian Howgate.
Bitter experience of IC
Dear Editor.
Recently, some civil engineering
undergraduates wrote to the
'Guildsheef to express their
dissatisfaction about the way they are
treated in the department. We
understand their frustrations very
well because we know the story from
an insider's point of view, except our
experience is a lot more bitter.
We applied to study at Imperial
because we were attracted by its
ruthless advertising which was so
convincing at the time. For those of
us who came from overseas, we
trusted the image built up by this
advertising, because we had nothing
else to go by. some of us did not know
any friends who had studied in this
department before. All of us now feel
badly cheated in many ways.
First of all. we have to fight
amongst ourselves for office
accommodation. I seems that they
take people on without considering
the problems of accommodation and
facilities. Once you are in the
department, you are commited to
paying your fees and hence your value
of being exploited has decreased, they
can start taking on more new comers.
The congestion got so bad that nobody
could work productively.
Surprisingly, despite many
complaints, nothing was done to ease
the tension. We put to a member of
staff that some students had already
warned their friends about the lack of
responsibilities shown by the
authority, and before long, people
would think twice about coming to
this department. Quite shockingly, he
said lhat by the time this happened,
he would have become a professor in
another university.
Some of the lecturers show no
Interest in their students' work. Many
of us do not get to see our
supervisors. For those fortunate ones
who do. they seldom get any advice.
Often, the supervisor does not know
the subject. They claim they are
working on a fashionable field in
order to attract funding. The lack of
accountability comes about because
they know industry does not pay
much attention to their fantasies
anyway. All they want is to attract
some public funding to write a few
academic papers for their promotion.
Of course there are those who are
very busy doing their private work.
It is a well known fact that the
sections within the department do not
help each other. Often, students are
caught in the political struggles of the
staff. Some of us are fortunate to get
advice from our good technicians and
hence can complete the study on time.
Others may not be so lucky, they are
completely helpless, it is unlikely they
will ever get their degrees, nobody is
interested in their work, nobody
knows enough about their work. This
is allowed to happen because there is
no system to check on the
supervisors. They always say they
have got bad students, we don't know
where or how to complain, we fear
we may suffer revenge.
For those of us on the MSc courses,
life is no better. We are faced with
very bad teaching skills. Some
teachers like to use the projector so
quickly that we cannot copy and listen
at the same time. Projects are set and
we are left on our own without
guidance. We never get a feedback on
how we have done in the project.
Mind you some of the courses don't
do projects because the supervisors
don't bother to think of a title. On the
other hand some projects turn out to
be consultancy work for the
supervisors and students are the best
kind of free labour.
All these are only some of our
problems, but if they are kept secret,
people will suffer a lot more damage.
We hope the authority is doing
something about it as a matter of
conscience.
