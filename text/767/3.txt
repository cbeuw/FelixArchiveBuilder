better informed?
Watch out for news of the
forthcoming Biological Society. A
new forum at Imperial College open
to all, to promote an awareness of the
Biological Sciences, their applications
and implications for industry,
technology, society and you.
We aim to appeal to people
thoughout IC with a range of speakers
and discussions on all manner of
biology-orientated themes. Our
inaugural meeting takes place on
Friday March 13th in Huxley 213 at
6.00pm. Our own Professor
Anderson (FRS. Head of Pure and
Applied Biology) will be giving us
'the low down' on the latest media
overkill of AIDS and its
epidemiology.
So. if you're worried about AIDS
or epidemiology (whatever that may
be) don't die of ignorance. Bring your
friends and questions and 50p for a
glass of something from 5.30pm.
