Philippines Support Group
While much publicity has been
given to the situations in E l
Salvador, Nicaragua, Poland etc
there does not seem to be a great
deal of general knowledge about
what is going on in the
Philippines.
A meeting of the Philippines
Support Group, chaired by
Labour M P Tom Clarke, on 5
May outlined the situation of a
country which has been under the
dictatorship of President Marcos
since 1972, when martial law was
declared. Trade unions, student
organisations and political
parties were all banned and
opposition was forced under-
ground.
Since then, over 70,000 people
have been detained as political
prisoners, two thirds have been
t o r t u r e d and some have
' d i s a p p e a r e d ' in c u s t o d y .
Government troops have killed
over 100,000 people, often by a
means ironically known as
'salvaging', whereby the bodies
are mutilated. After a recent
demonstration the bodies of four
students were found salvaged.
US military aid to Marcos in
1982 was $ 140.1m, plus $100m
rental for US bases. This year the
US have agreed to pay $900m as
rent for 22 American military
bases in the Philippines, some of
which store nuclear weapons.
While the Philippines is a 'rich'
c o u n t r y , the e c o n o m y is
d o m i n a t e d by A m e r i c a n ,
Japanese and European multi-
national companies, so 80% of
the population live on or below
the poverty line.
Wages are among the lowest in
Asia, unemployment is 40% and
hundreds of thousands are forced
to leave the Philippines to look
for work.
Opposition to the Marcos
regime is led by the National
D e m o c r a t i c F r o n t in a
revolutionary alliance; the major
armed force within the N D F is
the New Peoples Army which
operates in 53 out of 73
provinces. The Moro National
Liberation Front leads resistance
in the M u s l i m Provinces.
Opposition also comes in the
form of trade unions, religious
groups and a variety of political
organisations openly campaign-
