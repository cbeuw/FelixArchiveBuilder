Dear Pallab
It irked me no end when I
realised that you were as guilty
of some of the things you
accused Gaynor of (Editorial,
May 25). Did you, for instance,
consult, or seek an opinion
from Miss Gaynor about her
alleged authoritarian ways? If
not, why not? If you did then
why didn't you include them.
I am aware of the right to
reply facility you grant your
readers—but surely if such
serious allegations (most of
which lacked substantiation) are
made about a person (whom
you admit to be conscientious
and hard working) then the
editor owes her a space within
the editorial—especially since it
is the editor who's made those
allegations. She, unlike you
Pallab dear, does not enjoy the
privilege of writing a weekly
column that is widely read. She
unlike you is thus denied a
platform from which to express
her personal view publicly!
(Incidentally, was the article
merely one based on a personal
view or was some sort of
consensus tapped?)
In the light of what I've just1
said, don't you think some fair
play is in order. Or will you
choose to ignore my suggestion
for Gaynor to be given editorial
space next week and comments;
after all, you have the power to
determine what is printed and
what isn't. Will you, I wonder,
do a 'Gaynor' and thereby
confirm my belief that all
people in power are susceptible
to accusations of authoritari-
anism—Miss Gaynor and you
being no exceptions? I await the
next issue with eagerness.

Political
Inaction
Dear Pallab
I would like to draw people's
attention to one objection to the
President's Report that was not
covered in F E L I X last week.
This relates to the lack of
activity in External Affairs.
I agree with the sentiments
Page ^ • • n H M M H
Lettes.to.tfiesailor
expressed in last week's F E L I X
Editorial, that Gaynor Lewis
has w o r k e d h a r d a n d
conscientiously this year, whilst
at the same time has run a
closed Union and not taken an
active part in the wider
interests of student matters.
The lack of commitment to
External Affairs typifies this
position.
In answer to this criticism at
the A G M , she quoted her
report saying that she did not
stand on a "politically inclined
platform" (sic) and that she
regarded her duties within the
warm confines of the Union
Office as being of more
importance, and more within
her influence.
This non-political attitude is
an excuse for inaction. The
President should be elected on
the grounds of his or her
politics, as it is the politics of the
President that determines the
policy of the Union. Without
policies, the Union's function is
purely administrative, and
could be done by a permanent
member of staff. What is the
point of electing secretaries?
I see external affairs as being
one of the major political issues
which will affect the whole of
the educational system—IC
included.
Neglecting duties in the wider
issues of external affairs to
concentrate solely on internal
matters is surely a short-sighted
policy. It leaves I C U isolated
and inward looking, with no
outside expression or influence
other than through one or two
hard working individuals. Pete
Burt's tremendous contribu-
tions were surely overlooked
when awarding higher Union
honours.
Let's hope that next year's
executive can be more dynamic,
achieving more than good
administrative work, and not
remain deaf and closed to
student opinions and ideas as
typified by the U G M Chairman
at the A G M .

Jingoistic
Shit-Stirrer
Dear Pallab
On the shoulders of Steve
Marshall I march forth with my
faithful pen at my side.
I write in response to
Graham Brown's third glorious
offering. A n a p p a r e n t l y
standard defensive reply to last
week's comments it proceeded
to spout typically Conservative
bullshit. There are, no doubt,
Cuban backed forces in Africa
and there have been massacres
of innocent civilians (more
notably in Afghanistan and El
Salvador) in the cause of Soviet
and American hegemony but
this deliberate diversion of
attention from the evils of
apartheid leads me to ask M r
Brown...Are you a friend of
Apartheid or simply a jingoistic
shit-stirrer for President
Reagan?

Harassment
and
Intimidation
Dear Pallab
In his letter to you (FELIX
674), M r Burt (ICU External
Affairs Officer) certainly
dispelled any illusion he has
tried to create of impartiality on
the subject of NUS. He seems to
assume that the two 'Union
officers who were actually I
present at' N U S conference |
must have seen every single
incident that occurred there.
How else can he justify his
rather unpleasant implication
that the u n d e m o c r a t i c
behaviour described by M r
Brown is a fabrication? As one
of the Union officers M r Burt
places so much trust in was
reported in last week's F E L I X
to have enjoyed 'eating,
d r i n k i n g , ' s m o k i n g ' and
screwing' at the conference, his
premise is unlikely to say the
least.
Furthermore he claims that a
smear campaign against the
N U S has recently been
launched by the Federation of
Conservative Students. This is
not true, FCS and its members
have always felt it their duty to
keep o r d i n a r y s t u d e n t s
informed of inefficiencies and
injustices that the N U S tries to
hide beneath a facade of
representativeness and demo-
cracy. As 40% of students voted
conservative at the last general
election, and as every member
of F C S has joined of his own
free will, FCS tuly represents
the interests of a larger
proportion of students than
does any other student
organisation, including N U S
(which is controlled by 'Clause
Four' Marxists). Having talked
to numerous F C S delegates
who have been 'actually
present' at N U S conferences,
the stories of harassment and
intimidation that M r Brown
tells are depressingly familiar.
ICU seems to take a very
complacent attitude to the
NUS: 'We're O K . We're out of
that obnoxius, blatantly party
political organisation. We can
spend our money on student
activities, and hold elections
based on individual merit.' If
M r Burt had any sense of
responsibility, he would spend
some time h e l p i n g less
fortunate students from other
colleges with their disaffiliation
campaigns. Instead of this he
buries his head in the sand and
tries to cover up for his left wing
chums in N U S .
Finally, I am glad to see that
Mr Brown (Consoc Chairman-
elect) is continuing the all
i m p o r t a n t fight against
Bolshevism at IC and wish him
every success in doing so,
especially as I am bored of it,
and intend to do something
else.
Yours sincerely
