THE LESSON OF '81
When well on my way to
managing the incredible feat of
reading through all the annual
reports in one go (almost
certainly a world record!) I came
across the R C C report and there I
was made to ponder by a
seemingly innocent paragraph.
Under the heading 'Club
Activities' mention was made of
the 'Hazardous-rated' recrea-
t i o n a l clubs and of the
praiseworthy scheme whereby
these clubs were offered the
chance to send a number of
members on a British Red Cross
First Aid Course with R C C
paying the fees.
Now, I think this is a very good
idea and I join Hugh Stiles, the
R C C Chairman, in hoping that
the same scheme can be worked
next year.
Great!
What left me wondering,
however, was the mention of the
"spectre of Mountaineering
Club's Christmas 81 tour
climbing accident", and the claim
that a few safety policy
documents "will finally lay (it) to
rest". As it happens, I reckon that
very few of those who came to
Imperial since, know that there
has been an accident, and fewer
still know what happened or the
tragic consequences. I myself
learnt about it from press reports
at the time, but never heard of it
when I came to Imperial the
following autumn as a fresher; in
particular, no one would talk
about it when I went on the
Mountaineers freshers meet to
Bosigram.
The 'spectre' had been quickly
laid to rest in less than nine
months.
w r o n g
a t t i t u d e
While it is most understand-
able that peopole who had to
endure the sorrow of seeing a
fellow climber, and most of all, a
friend, slowly die and not be able
to help, would be reluctant to
recall and talk to outsiders about
those awful moments, the grief of
w h i c h one c a n n o t f u l l y
comprehend until one goes
through the same ordeal, it
certainly is a duty of all who are
involved in such activities and
who naturally are looked at by
the novices as masters, to make
people aware of the dangers
involved.
The Union Officer's annual reports were
published last week. Here, Giovanni Vacago
voices some of his misgivings about the RCC
chairman's report and suggests how mountain
safety can be improved
Let me say here that I am not
criticising anyone in particular,
nor just the Mountaineering Club
or its membership. I am
criticising an attitude which is
widespread throughout many
College clubs. That attitude
whereby to win to one's cause
more initiates, and therefore
more club members, only one
side of the coin, invariably the
good one, is shown in due detail.
That attitude whereby the clubs,
and in fact the whole Union set-
up renounced their educational
role.
s a f e t y
t h r e a t
Accidents can happen to even
the most experienced and safety
conscious mountaineer, walker,
caver, canoeist or what have you,
and with this in mind it is
important that people should
know how to deal with them,
hence the need for first aid
courses and the like.
Yet, more important still, is
that prospective mountaineers,
walkers etc be helped, I would
almost say forced, to gain
experience in a safe way and be
stimulated to consider carefully
the safety aspects of their chosen
activity.
Whenever accidents happen,
on a national level, there is an
outcry of protest from people
outside these sports, to whom the
loss of life for the sake of a
mountain, or for that of a deeper
cave or a faster rapid seem a sign
of absolute stupidity. A t such
times there is, invariably, a call
for the imposition of rules on
these sports: must this, must that.
I imagine that even a climbing
licence has been thought of.
b e y o n d
r u l e s
Yet, by their very nature, these
sports are, and can only be,
beyond rules.
It is questionable that the
drawing of such a set of rules
under the disguise of a 'safety
policy document' will be either
acceptable to or accepted by the
freedom seeking individual.
Ultimately, responsibility lies
with the individual since s/he will
make the final judgement on the
conditions and is the only one
who will have the last word on
whether s/he is up to the
standard required for that
particular route/cave/rapid.
Instead of trying to design such
a set of rules, which people for
over a century have denied could
exist, the main effort by the
Union and the clubs should be to
put individuals in a position
where they are able to take such
decisions knowledgeably and
i n d e p e n c e n t l y of outside
pressures.
I am not suggesting that R C C
safety policy documents, as they
stand, try and enforce such a set
of rules. I undestand they only go
as far as discouarging people
from undertaking solo ventures,
requiring them to state clearly
what their plan for the day is and
at what time they expect to come
back and other things like these.
What I am saying is that these
measures do not in fact go far
enough towards preventing
accidents, but one must admit
that they make things easier
should any trouble arise. I am
also saying that the end of the line
has been reached on that front
and that if tomorrow another
accident came to shake our
c o n s c i e n c e s , no f u r t h e r
restrictions should or could be
imposed on 'hazardous' clubs.
Rather the emphasis must
switch to education of the
individual and we must act now,
in order to prevent accidents, not
tomorrow, in their wake; the life
of a friend is too high a price for
our learning.
The m o r e e x p e r i e n c e d
members should not only
introduce the novices to the
technical aspects of the sport, but
also the problems involved and
how to surmount them; the
n o v i c e s s h o u l d be a l s o
introduced to how to look after
the club's and their own
equipment (how much Union
money is thrown away each year
in replacing equipment that, if
properly looked after, would last
much longer!) and to the respect
due to the environment one's
activity brings in contact with;
generally, they should be helped
to learn to approach the sport
with a well balanced attitude and
to be able to say 'no, not today!'.
In High magazine (no 9, April-
May 1983, p i 1) just after a party
of two teachers and seven .
schoolboys fell some 800ft down
a gully and two of them died, Vin
M a c h i n , a Mountaineering
Instructor, was quoted to have
said: "Climbers spend a lot of
money on equipment and they
make elaborate arrangements to
get to the mountains for a
weekend's climbing. They feel
they must attempt their chosen
climb even in poor conditions or
even if there are too many people
already on the climb."
c o w a r d l y
d e c i s i o n ?
During a weekend trip to
North Wales with the Scout and
Guide Club last winter, a party of
f o u r a m o n g s t the m o s t
experienced climbers in the club
turned back in the face of
avalanche danger even from a
climb rated at the easiest end of
the scale. There was no sense of
shame o r f a i l u r e , r a t h e r
consciousness that the right
decision had been taken,
although a difficult one when one
gets all the way from London to
the foot of the climb for nothing.
How many others would have
done the same?
How many more would have
felt pressurised by the presence of
others not to take a decision
which might seem cowardly?
It is not being cowardly, it is
being sane!
Let the Union and the clubs
help people to take sane
decisions, when these are called
for.
Only then will we have learnt a
lesson from the tragedy on that
cold winter day in 1981.
