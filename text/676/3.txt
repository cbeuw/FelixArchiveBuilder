Confidence Trickster
A confidence trickster, posing
as a student, obtained money
from an IC postgraduate on
Tuesday under falses pretences.
The man, an African about 6ft
tall, approached a number of
students and said that he was
destitute. He then offered a
forwarding address in return for
a 'loan' of cash. Union officers
were suspicious when it became
apparent that he had given
different names and addresses to
different students.
He also attempted to obtain
cash from the Union Office,
saying that he needed it for train
fare.
Union President Gaynor Lewis
warned students to be on their
guard and on*no account to part
with any money if approached by
this man.
Departments
are unsafe
An officer from the Health and
Safety Inspectorate has been
touring Imperial College over the
last few days. Already she has
served 'improvement notices' on
two departments, informing
them o f unsafe w o r k i n g
conditions or apparatus. The
departments involved, C i v i l
Engineering and Aeronautical
Engineering, face substantial
fines if they fail to carry out the
necessary improvement work.

Missing!
M e m b e r s of the C o l l e g e
administration were shocked to
notice the disappearance last
month of M r Alf Toft, Surveyor
in the Estates section. One day he
turned up for work as usual, the
next day he was gone. Dismayed
colleagues realised that he wasn't
coming back when his office was
cleared out by cleaning staff.
Speculation is also rife at the
moment regarding M r D o n
Clarke, Head of the Estates
section. He is at a course in
Reading at the moment; will he
have a job to come back to when
they've taught him to read?
Union sanctions
against College
The IC Branch of the Association
of Scientific, Technical and
Managerial Staffs ( A S T M S )
resolved on Friday, at an
emergency meeting, to take
sanctions against the College.
The list of sanctions is not
e x h a u s t i v e , b u t i n c l u d e
withdrawal of technicians from
College committees, refusal to
operate untested electrical
equipment and refusal to cover
for absence due to sickness or
holidays.
The dispute arises from a
disagreement over the Easter
Holiday arrangements. Tech-
nical staff took what they
thought was their proper
entitlement, but in three
departments such staff had their
pay stopped for one day.
A delegation from A S T M S
went to see M r John Davidson,
Personnel Secretary. He refused
to consider refunding the staff
pay untnil proper holiday
arrangements were finalised. The
A S T M S refused to negotiate
until members have their pay
restored.
The staff who had pay docked
were from just three depart-
ments: Elec Eng, Chem Eng and
G e o l o g y . D e p a r t m e n t a l
S u p e r i n t e n d a n t s i n these
departments were instructed by
personnel to supply a list of those
who took the holiday in question.
The College dealt with the
situation by paying staff a
negative amount of pay for the
d a y c o n c e r n e d . A S T M S
President, Harry Fairbrother,
has responded by telling members
to write cheques for negative
amounts and send them to
College.
The sanctions are likely to
cause severe problems in certain
departments, particularly where
t e c h n i c i a n s operate v i t a l
electrical equipment. The
A S T M S have pledged, however,
that under no circumstances will
their dispute affect examinations.
