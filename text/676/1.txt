The fire alarms in Southside Halls continue to go off regularly,
despite assurances from the Estates section that the problem has
been reduced "almost to zero". The alarm sounded on both
Sunday night and Monday night at the beginning of a week when
many students have exams. Wardens are concerned that residents
are effectively left without a fire alarm since, because ofthe large
number of false alarms, residents are taking no notice of the
alarm.
One Warden in Southside has
already said that he doubts he
could evacuate his Hall in the
event of a real emergency. In
addition many residents are
furious that their sleep is being
disturbed during the revision
period.
The Estates Section claim that
they are controlling the situation
by monitoring false alarms, and
replacing faulty smoke detectors
each time they go off. But M r W
D Evans, Chief Engineer, was
unaware on Wednesday that the
alarm had gone off over the
holiday weekend. It wasn't until
F E L I X contacted Estates that
the contractor fitting the system
was informed of the latest false
alarms.
The problem arises from
smoke detectors that are
activated by fumes from toasters,
said M r Evans. "Students will
make toast, and when they make
toast they burn it," he added.
Some residents were sceptical of
this explanation since the alarms
have regularly gone off between
the hours of 2:00 and 3:00am.
The Estates section claim that
they are informed by Sherfield
security every time the alarm in
Southside goes off. Fire Officer
Bob Foggon then authorises
replacement of the faulty
detector by the contractors, Fire

The new fire alarm system was
installed by F A C E more than two
months ago to bring Southside
into line with G L C fire
regulations. The plans included
the fitting of smoke detectors in
communal areas and landings
and it is largely, though not
e x c l u s i v e l y , these smoke
detectors that have caused
problems.
The original spate of false
alarms more than a month ago,
was attributed to "teething
problems". On Wednesday, the
Chief Engineer, M r W D Evans,
felt able to say that the problem is
reduced to zero and that F A C E
are a good firm that have been
used before and will be used
again.
Portrait
The Rector of Imperial College,
Lord Flowers, is to have his
portrait painted in June. This is
to celebrate his 60th birthday in
September.
Departments are being invited
to contribute up to £250 each
towards the cost of the painting, a
birthday present to the Rector.
The distinguished artist Kyffin
Williams R A O B E is to be
commissioned to paint the
Rector. It is thought that only
two sittings will be necessary.
Water Calamity!
The Chemistry New Building was
left without power and lighting
over the weekend and Bank
Holiday. The main power cable
was burnt through after water
leaked from the seventh floor to
the sub-basement.
O r i g i n a l fears that the
interruption in supply would
cause serious damage proved
unfounded, and long term
damage should be minimal.
It is thought that the flood was
caused when a water tap vacuum
pump burst. A large volume of
water then percolated its way
through the building, fusing the
power supply when ground level
was reached.
The Central Stores depart-
ment, which is situated in the
basement of Chemistry, felt the
full effect of the power failure. A n
electric sewage pump failed, and
volumes of sewage started to
build up in the stores. Workers
from the Estates section cleared
the sewage using brooms. They
were unable to obtain gum-boots
for the operation.

Secretaries and library staff
staged a lightning half-day strike
yesterday in protest of a 3% pay
offer. The staff, who are members
of the National Association of
Local Government Officers
( N A L G O ) , received strike
instructions from national
headquarters on Thursday
morning.
Ms Marilyn Evers, N A L G O
Executive Committee member,
said that a deputation was being
sent to see the Rector. They are
demanding a pay increase of
more than 3%, she said.
The strikers hoped to bring
many offices around College to a
standstill. It was up to individuals
to strike or not, but wide-spread
support was expected.
N A L G O members picketed
the gates of the College after
meeting outside the L y o n
Playfair Library at 12:00 noon
yesterday.
