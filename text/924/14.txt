The Amazing Flying Gerbil
Machine bids a fond farewell to
bad singers, potatoes and the
world in general in...
The End of an Era
A still from one of Matt and Sumit's favourite films; Die Kroppe starring
Perter Weinstag and directed by Jon Pertwee.
Obituary : O r . The Tale O f A n
Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine
Save for the posthumous review
we will release that will go to
Number 1 for eight weeks, we're
pushing up daisies. Just like
Freddy. But Freddy's dead, isn't
he? Dear, dear Freddy. Dear, dear
Johnnie. Dead. Johnnie. In 3D I
hear. Johnny Depp. Bastard!
So there we were, walking down
Oxford Street one day. but who
should appear round the corner but
our old mucker David Soul!
'Hutch!', we said. A n d he was
walking Filthy the Dog! 'Art'!', he
said. A n d it came to us - we shall
Review! A n d David said, That is
Good. G o ye my spiritual children
and be Fruitful. A n d Filthy said
"Art". A n d David gave us the
Word, and the Word was Shite
because it has an arrogant Scouse
Wanker on it.
And so it came to pass that
timorously we entered the Office of
Felix. No-one knew who we were,
or what we did. and they sayed:
'Who are you, that doth open all the
mail and use sundry paste-up
implements?' A n d were it not for
our resignation, we would be there
still.
(*whip out top hats and canes*)
We used to review lots of films
And paste up all the jottings.
Now we're dead.
So enough said.
W e ' l l just lie here rotting.
We used to go watch all the hits
And try to give an unbalanced
view
O f all the good and bad bits
Trving to rhyme is very hard to
do'
Doo be do be do be do (-NB.
from Sinatra)
(*Soft shoe shuffle*)
We used to do be do be do be
do
Do be do be do be do
But now we do be do be do be
do do do be do
Putrefaction (do be do) supreme.
So. on entry to the Felix office
we met Adam of Tinworth. and
verily he said : "In On A Monday,
Out On A Wednesday"
Do be do be do. A n d to this
maxim we have stayed. Save for
when it were inconvenient. Good
old fashioned quality (hrumph)
newswork at a price Y O U can
afford.
No thanks. N o regrets. N o sleep
'til bedtime. N o guts, no glory. N o
man's land. N o retreat, no
surrender. N o w that was a great
movie. Where the kid had to beat
the guy who crippled his father in
a breakdance/karate fight frenzy
after the ghost of Bruce Lee trains
him in 'the way of the open
palm(tree)'. Great film. And so was
the sequel. A n d so was the third
one. Thanks are due to Winona.
And to Bill ' n ' Ted. A n d Eddy The
Amazing Comedy Underpants.
Thanks to Jonty's spandex leopard
strides, for much mirth. Thanks to
Wile E . Coyote for not working out
the one with the anvil and the rocket
skates, and to Tiny Clanger. Doo
be do. Thanks also to Jane Badler.
D o n n y O s m o n d deserves an
honourable enema, as does the man
they're all calling ' R i c h a r d ' ,
Richard Clayderman. Thanks to
TeleDisc and Chatback, with whom
the world is a sadder place. Thanks
to The Wheel O f Fortune, for the
elephant of luck. A l l round good
vibes and happy thorts to Laurie
P.(ike) and Ronco for the Nasal Hair
Remover. Doo be do be do. (*High
kicks from top of staircase*). With
thanks to little Doris Schwartz from
Fame, thanks for the annual guys,
and all merry lovelies to the B B C
weathermen without whom we
wouldn't have any weather at all,
ever. Thanks to Martin Cripps for
his wise words on interfacing and
a big Motorola 68000 to Prof.
Doogie. Big unthanks to Gail
Bellew, with sympathy to Janet
Ellis. Don't worry Janet love, we
won't go back to those big pax. We
know they all say this, but it really
werked. Not a chewing-gum white.
No thanks to Garfield (he's a lazy
cat) and definitely sewerage to
Bristow (he's a lazy man). A s for
Marmaduke (he's a big dog) he can
stay smeared. Thanks to the K L F
for releasing the same record five
times. Great whoo whoos lads. N o
thanks to C & C whose cover of an
U2 record is even worse than
Brabra Dickson (not a misprint).
Whoo whoo. Whoo Whoo. Doo be
do. Brownie points to the Puppy
and Lawnmower Deth.
W e hate everything and drink
bleach. Here's a few : Tina Turner,
legs like a billiard cue and the gall
of a septic kidney stone combined
with the allure of a nanny-goat's
rectal fluid and the dramatic effect
of eight gallons of elderly pus. I
love her really. Rozalla. for the
power of love. Michael Bolton, for
being more crap than I have words.
Simon Bates, for everything but
Our Tune". (For 'Our Tune' he
rots in a rectal gibbet for all
eternity). Gary 'Oooh Fucking'
Davies. Elizabeth Taylor and
Roseanne Barr. Where is Gary
C o l e m a n ? W h e r e is Danny
Partridge? Y o u really want to
know: Gary's a recluse who plays
all day with his trains. Danny (of
the Family) is sweating it out on a
charge of soliciting and assaulting
a transvestite prostitute. A x l Rose
for his whole life. Hey A x l ! Y o u
know those 'faggots who beat you
up'?. Good. Not bad, 860 words of
pure drivel so far. Robert Robinson
for finally plucking up the courage
to say 'fornication' on telly this
afternoon. A n d we think it was a
bluff. Nick Ross, you're shit. Well,
that's our opinion, and we can
prove it, M r . Libel Lawyer.
Although the crimes shown
tonight are horrifying, remember
that there's little chance of it
happening to you. So sleep well,
don't snore and be good to your
mother.
