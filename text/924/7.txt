Permi, all is forgiven!
Having beaten all in their path, the
Dribblers now faced R H B N C in the
quarter-finals o f the U L C u p on
Saturday (25th January). However
they started shakily with goalie
Emma bulldozing the opposition's
forwards to concede a penalty, and
soon found themselves in the
unusual position of being 1-0 down.
Undeterred, the team regrouped and
equalised seconds later to show
R H B N C that they meant business.
From then on the Dribblers were on
their way.
After being 6-1 up. star
midfielder Rachel was stretchered
off the pitch, her face dripping with
blood. With only 10 players
remaining R H B N C were allowed a
consolation goal, to finish losers
6-2. But true to their form, the
Dribblers thrashed them in the boat
race! This result comfortably put
them through to the semi-finals to
face Kings College.
The next day at 11am only 6
players had turned up with the semi-
final beckoning. B y noon the
Dribblers had managed to scrape
together 9 (2 of whom were
absolute beginners) and had
arranged to meet 2 more at
Wimbledon station. True to form,
goalie Emma kept us all in suspense
and arrived just as the train was
about to depart. At last they had a
full team, and the captain could
breathe a premature sigh of relief.
However on arrival, the team
found to their horror a ground more
suitable to mud wrestling than for
football. Ignoring the inadequacies
of the pitch, the Dribblers began
well, especially in defence against
a vicious attack but seemed to be
lacking something up front (Permi
maybe ?). With an excellent goal
line clearance from Rachel and
Emma tipping one shot over the bar
in spectacular fashion, the Dribblers
prevented the opposition from
scoring. Therefore at half time, they
were unlucky to be 1-0 down.
After a team talk, w h i c h
everybody chose to ignore, disaster
struck in the second half. With
enthusiasm lacking plus a series of
injuries and fatigue problems from
the previous days quarter-final
game, the Dribblers faded grimly
and ended up losing 6-0.
Sorry Permi. we tried our best!
Previously, the Dribblers has
played East Anglia in the U A U
Cup. The game was played on a
cold, wet and dreary day and when

Snooker Doubles
Yes. snooker is back this term (did
it ever go away'.'). And the lights are
working as the electricians have
fixed the fuses. So to celebrate this
magnificent achievement, the IC
Billiards and Snooker Club are
proud to present the February
Doubles Knock-Out Tournament.
All you have to do is find a
partner who is ten times better than
yourself and then fork out the
enormous amount of £1 each. (For
mathematics, that is £2 per pair).
All the entrance money will go
towards cash prizes for the winners
and runner-ups.
So if you are licking your lips
with glee, come along to the
Snooker room (it's still on the top
floor o f the Union Building) at any
lunchtime to enlist. The closing date
for all entries is Friday 7th
February, with the competition
commencing on Monday 10th
those who have difficulty with their February.

AudioSoc
This Thursday 6th February, the
Cornflake Shop is opening its doors
after hours exclusively for the IC
Audio Society. Members have been
invited to the shops premises to
audition equipment of their choice.
This is just the latest chapter in
the long running relationship
between the Cornflake Shop and
AudioSoc. Cornflake's founders,
Steve Moore and Chris Storch are
both former members of IC and
during their time became Audio
Society chairman and treasurer
respectively.
Those members who want to go
should either meet the committee in
Southside Upper Lounge at 7pm or
make their own way to 37 Windmill
Street off Tottenham Court Road,
lo arrive by 7.30pm.
they only had 10 players. After
conceding 2 unlucky goals in the
lirst half, the Dribblers fought back
valiantly.
The defence were amazing,
especially Linda who even saved a
near home goal from Arlene. It was
a moral victory, even though they
lost 2-0!
The weather was freezing - with
showers to match. T o drown their
sorrows all had bevvies on the way
back which nearly resulted in the
driver being overcome by the
fumes. Thanks to Sharon who drove
with speed and efficiency - what a
star. And the Dribblers would like
to say hello to Sharon's mum!
Despite all these losses, the
Dribblers are still top of the league,
so all is not lost (yet?).
Jumping
Now that Christmas is over and
grant cheques and student loans
have put a new lease o f life into
your massive overdraft, this is the
time to do your most challenging
feat yet - a parachute jump! A v i d
readers o f this illustrious
publication will already know that
Rag are organising sponsored jumps
in aid o f Mencap. but for all those
people who didnUt know or who
were too lazy to do anything about
it. now is your chance to make up.
The club is running a training
weekend in Peterborough over
Saturday 22 February and anyone
interested in doing a sponsored
jump for Mencap, or any other
charity, however large or small are
more than welcome. For the less
public spirited people there is also
the simple option o f handing over
£85 to get all the training needed
and first flight up.
For the rich people, or those with
very generous friends there is the
even more exciting option of doing
free fall from 10000 feet!! This is
dead (no pun intended) simple and
just involves strapping yourself to
a big butch (fully qualified)
parachutist.As you are paying for
his expertise this unfortunately costs
£125. but can be done by raising
money for Barnardos.
Anyone who is interested in any
of these propositions, or has other
suggestions, or is already a fully
Hedged parachutist should come to
a short video presentation in the
Brown Committee Room at 6.30 on
Thusday 6th February, or come
along to any Parachute meeting at
12.30 on Mondays in the Brown
Committee Room
