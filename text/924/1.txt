Holiday Rip-Off
Students living in College Halls of
Residence could be charged £ I % per
day it they require a room during
the Easter vacation.
The state o f vacation
accommodation has been made
worse by a letter distributed this
week by Loretta O'Callaghan.
College Accommodation Officer,
stating that storage facilities for the
holiday could not be guaranteed to
all students, even though they
would have to pay increased rates
to keep their room during Easter.
In an interview with the Student
Television o f Imperial College
(STOIC). M s O'Callaghan said that
it is highly unlikely that any storage
facilities will be available for
students in areas used for business
purposes'. These include Weeks.
Linstead and Southside Halls o f
Residence which are used as
conference accommodation during
the holidays.
In previous years, one room has
been set aside per approximately 25
students to store personal
belongings over Easter and this year
Jean Harries. Southside Halls
Housekeeper, said 'the utmost will
be done to provide facilities but
there can be no guarantee of
storage'.
Graham Daniels. Residences
Area Manager, said provision for
storage will be the same as in the
last few years, but said he could not
comment about any increase in
accommodation prices as it was not
what he dealt with.
Radio Petition
Imperial College Radio launched a
petition on 22nd January to try to
gel support for an F M licence. The
licence would allow the station to
broadcast up to three miles from its
studios which would include Evelyn
Gardens as well as all Southside
residences.
M r David Lane. IC Radio Station
Manager, said an F M licence would
give better sound quality and that
response from listeners to a test
licence three years ago was
amazing'. The Department of
Trade and Industry, who award
Radio licences, did not award a full
licence for unknown reasons. M r
Lane continued that IC Radio had
more equipment than 'many
professional stations' and could
broadcast on F M as soon as a
licence was granted. He claimed
this would give the Union better
value for the £25,000 that has been
invested in the Radio Station over
the past ten years.
M r Lane was not optimistic about
receiving a licence, as many
politicians are caught up with the
forthcoming general elections, but
the prospects were good for the
station to get a licence within the
next three years.
WC Closed
Westfield College, the Hampstead.
site o f Queen Mary and Westfield
College ( Q M W C ) in London, is to
finally close at the end of this
academic year. Jo Fisher. Q M W C
Mile End Road site Vice President,
told Felix that the College was
building more accomodation to
house the expected 450 to 500 new
students. She added that all of them
should be able to continue their
degrees without hinderance. but that
students from Westfield College
were 'very bothered' about the
move. This comes at the end over
over two years o f negotiations.

EGM Plug
The Extraordinary General Meeting
( E G M ) on Thursday 6 February
could see women banned from the
Union Bar. The motion has been
proposed by Emma Holmes (Chem
I) who suggested that as only 23%
of Imperial students are female, the
masculine majority should be
allowed their own watering hole in
which rugby players and the like
will be able to wallow. Miss
Holmes believes this will be a great
attraction to prospective students.
Union President Zoe Hellinger
will propose that Departmental
Representatives should regain the
right to vote on the Union Council.
This right was removed in 1991
when the new Union Bye-Laws
were passed by the Governing Body
of the College, whereupon they
became permanent observers. Other
motions will include the affiliation
to the Anti-Nazi League and a
proposal c o n c e r n i n g student
hardship.
This meeting will also see the
