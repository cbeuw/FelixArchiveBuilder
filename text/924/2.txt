Letters Felix 924 31 January 1992
Credit that
Dear Adam.
'A Very Select Committee'
1 suppose that our sophisticated
students need little guidance on the
credence to be placed upon
statements by M e m b e r s o f
Parliament, but your report last
week on the student loan issue "his
daughter had got it within 24 hours
of application in Nottingham...It
was suggested that the delay was
due to College processes', must
surely raise a credulous eyebrow.
The Registry's involvement in
student loans is to confirm a
student's eligibility for a loan—i.e.
that the student is under 50. a U K
student on a designated course, and
that the required date about bank
account numbers etc has been
entered on the eligibility form
correctly by the student. In order
that we can provide this
confirmation we have to inspect
particular bits o f documentation,
e.g. birth certificate. L E A Award
letter, passport etc.
When the eligibility certificate is
completed we keep two copies, and
two copies are taken by the student
who goes away and decides whether
or not to pursue an application for
a loan. W e keep one copy of the
eligibility certificate for our records
-and despatch the other copy to the
Cosmopolitan
Student L o a n s C o m p a n y in
Glasgow.
Eligibility certificates are posted
by Registry to Glasgow after every
day's i n t e r v i e w i n g has been
completed i.e. within 24 hours of
the interview. Nothing else happens
until the student actually applies
direct to the S L C .
If everything is in order the S L C
reckon on 21 days to get the money
into a student's account. But as the
official blurb says "Once the
C o m p a n y has received your
application form and a matching
confirmation from your college thai
you are eligible, it will draw up a
formal loan agreement and send it
to you. The agreement will include
an authorisation for a direct debit
to be made from your account after
you leave your course in order to
repay the loan. You should sign this
agreement and return it to the
Company. Payments will then be
credited directly into your account.'
So the 24 hours claim is
nonsense. The S L C promise 21
days if everything goes well. A n d
no money will appear until the
application form has gone in and the
agreement form signed and returned
to the S L C .
Yours sincerely.
P.E. Mee.
Dear Adam.
Thought you might like to know
that International Night is again-
around the corner. This year.
International Night is being held on
Friday 28th February and we
promise lots of food, fun and
entertainment.
The highlight of the evening is the
cultural show with traditional
dances and music. W e need all
those out there with hidden talents
to come forward. There will be a
meeting on Tuesday 4th February
1992 ( E E . Room 403, 12.30pm).
Otherwise, please contact me via
my pigeonhole before the 7th Feb.
Thanks a lot!
Yours sincerely.

The mouse that roared
Dear Sir.
Please may I congratulate the
person or persons responsible for
the new security system operating
in the U n i o n B u i l d i n g on
Wednesday and Friday evenings. I
was so pleased to hear that the
violent incidents perpetrated last
term by IC students had sparked a
re-evaluation o f the security
measures.
The new policy of allowing
students into the building only after
p r o d u c i n g a v a l i d U n i o n
membership card will obviously
deter the vandals and hooligans who
are from outside College—i.e. none
of them. And the policy of having
to sign guests in will enable those
causing trouble to be identified and
banned from a Union Building that
they would never have visited again
anyway. What a stroke of genius,
don't you agree?
On a more serious note, after the
incident on Friday the 17th January,
in w h i c h several students
dismantled a piano and a sabbatical
was banned from the building due
to irresponsible behaviour, we
ought to keep the new system if
only as a source of great amusement
to those of us who haven't been
sucked into the complex power
politics of a students' union. May
I also suggest that M r Steve
N e w h o u s e , duty officer on
Wednesday evenings, have the
wording on his identification card
changed from 'authorised to enter
any area' to 'authorised to enter any
anal passage belonging to a senior
member o f the Union and lick
entirely clean". I hope to God he
doesn't stand for a sabbatical
position!
Pours faithfully.

Lobo to me
Dear Adam.
On reading the review of Don't

The two main Union activities
cropping up this term (as being
honorary secretary goes) are
Elections and Colours.
Elections shouldn't need too
much o f an explanation. A l l
sabbatical and officer posts are
elected across campus or at the
U G M on 12th March. If you wish
to stand for any post then go and see
the present holder for details.
For the sabbatical elections,
voting is across all departments on
9th and 10th of March. So if you
want to earn £3 an hour by sitting
on a ballot box. come and see me.

is so funny about the name Lobo?
Yours.

The other item was 'Colours'.
These are awards made by the
Union to anybody who the Union
considers has been of great help or
useful to its running. Anyone can
nominate anyone else for colours
awards. If you wish to nominate
someone then pass on the relevant
details (their name, yours and why
they deserve them) to me by
Monday 16th March at 5.30pm.
The E G M is in the J C R on
Thursday at 1pm the prime reason
is to elect a new Rag Chairman but
there is some other business.
