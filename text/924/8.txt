- You Love Us
This is a piece of pop-astical vinyl
history. A landmark in the evolution
of the senses, it sends you places
that y o u dream about when
something else has sent you
somewhere. Y o u w i l l lifted,
moved, stirred, agitated, aerated.
When the needle reached the end.
the finality, of the record, and the
arm was swinging slowly back on
its majestic path I felt like a blind
person that could suddenly see and
realised that an orange is called an
orange because it is orange. Lying
on my bed 1 did not want to move.
You can't help feeling that people
will be talking about the seriality of
this record, its all encompassing
roundness, the r deep, deep
blackness, and the little hole in the
middle that is a portal to another
dimension, letting shaft of light pass
from the higher plane to our mortal
domain. 1 will remember this
experience for the rest of my Earth
bound days. The magnificent
beauty of the enigma will live
forever.
O . K . . it was quite good.

- The Revenge
I would first like to take this
opportunity to deny all allegations
made in the Dear Marge column
this week. I would like to say
they're not true.
Onto this week's outstanding
selection of bands. They're not
particularly outstanding actually,
but I'd feel guilty if you didn't have
anywhere to go. Starting at the top
this week, we have 2 Lost Sons,
fresh and frantic after a Lise Yates
interview, and she says " I ' d advise
you to go and see them." What
further recommendation could you
desire? Yeah, you're prob'ly right,
but I think you'd better just listen
to her.
Redd Kross? See the review
elsewhere. But on vinyl they're not
at all bad.
They Might Be Giants. They
might not, they might just have one
or two hit singles, not to put too fine
a point on it, not Constantinople.
They might be p l a y i n g the

My Life Story
- Marquee
The first band of the night were so
tedious I slept through them. This
is becoming a habit. I suspect I may
have contracted sleeping sickness
the last time I went abroad
(Coventry).
The second band were much
better, an effective cure for
drowsiness, in the EMF Jesus Jones
mode. After they finished their set.
I asked the bloke next to me who
they were, and he said " T r a s h . "
After spotting my bamboozled look,
he explained that Trash is their
name, and they released a single on
Captain Sensible's record label
about 18 months ago. and they're
about to release another. Not a
particularly prolific rale of work,
but their live set certainly shows
that practice makes quite good.
Ladies and Gentlemen, My Lite
Story....an excellent opening light
show, a great line in inter song
banter.. .My Life Story are an eight
piece set up: Jake, the singer, who
probably has delusions of Wonder
Stuff- ness. a bassist, keyboard-
sampler person, a drummer, and a
four piece multi- faceted orchestral
section capable of turning their •
hands to violins, violas and flutes
amongst other things. And together
they produce a sort of orchestral
Smiths. Morrissey meets the
Munich Philharmonic if you like,
similar in a way to Terry Hall's
Terry. Blair. Anouchka project, if
you've heard of them.
My Life Story have a veritable
range of truly excellent ( Ted )
songs, which, us far as my
detoxified mind can remember,
included Theme from Checkmate (
supposedly about an as yet unmade
film! ), The Angel ( tube station ),
The Laughing Clock. A Short Song
About Everything, and Y o u Don't
Sparkle.
But they do sparkle. They shine.
This is the best gig I've seen so far
this year, and it's going to take
some beating.

Ce Ce Peniston
- Finally
Over the Christmas holidays my
sister asked why it was that all the
dance music in the charts these days
was stuff that anyone could do. I did
my best to nobely defend the dance
scene and stated that although most
of the stuff in the charts was crap,
to actually get anywhere decent it
had to be that little bit better than
the rest.
It is true to say that both Finally
and We got a love thang released
by Miss Ce Ce Peniston are good
songs. They are. in my opinion, no
way great, but they are good. It was
on this basis that I was keen to see
what the album would yield.
For someone with such a fine
voice she has obviously got in with
the wrong crowd. The album.
Finally, as it says on the promo
information sheet, features ten
songs from a host o f songwriters
and producers'. This is its downfall,
il seems like a lot of mediocre
songwriters and producers trying
their hand at the type of chart dance
music that my sister thinks anyone
could do.
The album has ended up a
complete hotchpotch with two songs
that have made it. a couple that
could almost make it and the rest
that I wouldn't listen to again. It's
a shame really.
One good point is that if buying
(I'm not recommending you do. it's
just in case) in vinyl you will get a
free bonus 12" single featuring six
David Morates (who?) mixes of
Finally.
David Morates must be yet
another random trying his hand. A l l
five mixes (the original's on as well
are basically 'which instrument
shall I remove for two verses,
next?'. They all go on for far too
long and you're never entirely sure
il you've got past the intra, until the
song actually stops. Yep they're that
type.
I really can't wait for her next
album. Hopefully someone high up
somewhere should have realised her
potential and put it to good use.
Finally, 'cause puns like that
don't come along often, if you liked
the singles, buy them again, just
don't buy the album.
Votef (or Howie!).
