Nikita. the top French film of 1990.
starring the gorgeous A n n e
Parillaud.
Following a shoot out during a
raid on a Parisian drugstore, Nikita
(the title heroine) is given a life
sentence for the murder of a
gendarme, instead she finds herself
given the choice of either death or
becoming a government assassin,
the world outside has been told that
she is dead. She has little choice and
so starts training for her new career.
Transferred to a gigantic hi-tech
warehouse she is trained in the skills
of the trade - including the finer
points of femininity. At first she is
rebellious, but gradually she

Grease
The long awaited opening of Grease
was. I am sorry to say. a
disappointment. T w o hours of
nonexistent story later I find myself
wondering where £8000 of Union
money has gone.
When the production finally
started, fifteen minutes late, we
were subjected to random bursts of
feedback during the opening
numbers as microphones were
handed around the stage willy-nilly.
As the evening progressed we were
shocked by the complete lack of
direction on stage. Too many
participants hindered the smooth
flow in large dance routines, long
scene changes broke up what little
plot there was.
The set was probably the best part
of the production. The neon signs,
effective 'burger bar' and multi-
levelled stage, supporting a live
band, did add considerable aesthetic
appeal, but the lighting never
reached its full potential bearing in
mind the size of the lighting rig.
Sandy (Rowan Fenner) battled
excellent student, and an apparent
favourite of her tutor Bob. After the
lengthy training she is launched into
her new career of disposing of
targets according to instructions.
Her release to the outside world
brings a new identity, boyfriend,
fiat and comfortable lifestyle. The
happiness brings complications
including hiding from her boyfriend
the true nature of her work. Each
murder that she executes causes
increasing anguish and remorse,
and we witness her slow
deterioration as the double life that
she has to lead takes its toll. Filmed
in the familiar azure glow that is the
hallmark of Besson movies, Nikita
is a stylish film that maintains the
suspense throughout with a dead
sexy star, miss it at your peril.
The film will be screened in
Mech Eng 220. at 7-30 pm,
Thursday 6th February. Entry is
80p for members, and 1-80 for non
members, so come along for a great
evenings entertainment.
with poor sound management
throughout the first act but picked
up noticeably after the interval
when control of the sound board
changed hands. The contribution
made by the rest of the 'pink ladies'
was also good. The male chorus
was less polished and was vastly
overpowered by the women's
voices most of the time. Sadly,
Danny (Ben Guest), did not meet up
to the requirements of such a
demanding lead and was outshone
by other members o f the 'Burger
Palace Boys', notably Roger (Ed
Mulligan).
The production needed another
full dress rehearsal to remove the
final glitches in the performance.
However, the band conducted itself
most professionally. By the time
you read this review. Grease will
have had three performances. The
cast and crew will hopefully have
relaxed into their roles and provide
stunning final performances on the
Friday and Saturday nights.
The opening night suffered from
technical problems which should be
resolved as the show continues
although it would have been more
professional if this had been
achieved beforehand.

Somebody's been busy with paste
and bSush. the posters are
everywhere around West London.
All My Sons is set in late 40s
America and it's based around the
Keller family. Jo Keller (Ian
Bannen) is the father of the sons.
One of which, Chris, works with
him at his factory. The other son,
Larry, never came back from the
war. The father and son admit that
Larry must be dead but the mother
is going to keep on waiting. When
Ann. Larry's childhood sweetheart,
comes to stay, for she is now
Chris's girl, the initial portrait of a
happy, secure and loving family is
gradually dismantled. Jo Keller is
a charismatic, jovial and popular
man. He is successful in business
and his family is his drive. But we
discover what this is based upon and
this raises many questions on
l o y a l t y . patriotism and
responsibility.
There are many issues that run
through this play and many clever,
witty and poignant lines. A s we got
closer to the truth of each character
in the play the implications of the
issues widen. Y o u really do see. if
you didn't already know, how easy
it is for a family to be held together
by lies and fear of the truth.
Matthew Marsh as Chris and
Susan Sylvester as A n n were both
excellent and carried it for some of
the weaker performances. Namely,
Ian Bannen who was sloppy and
unconvincing. Unfortunately half
the cast had plausible, unobtrusive
American accents and the rest were
either over the top. half-hearted or
they slipped in and out of different
accents. On the whole though, it's
a sensitive and powerful
production.
The Young V i c is a friendly and
informal theatre and was founded
in 1970 to make theatre more
accessible to young people and
students. It is also theatre in the
round which can make you feel
more involved in the play. All My
Sons runs until February 29th.
Tickets are £7.50 with student card
and £13 without. For performance
times call the Box Office on
071-633 0133.
