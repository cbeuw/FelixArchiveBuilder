Eat, Candyland Catherine Wheel
- Windsor Old Trout - Balloon EP
The O l d Trout. Where? Windsor.
Where? Try the promenade, a few
minutes walk from the station, or
a few minutes walk from the
riverside parking. Lovely.
The pub is good. Right down to
the proper beer and the groovy train
circling the bar. The venue is
almost as good... without the proper
beer. A n d it's just outside the door.
Yeah, and who heard of friendly
bouncers?
The place initially resembles a
school common room - the student
population of Windsor uses it as the
hang out. just w e a r i n g the
appropriate T-shirt each week...
The atmosphere thickens until
eventually the Candyland boys
arrive on the scene. C r o w d
participation? Y o u must be joking.
A 7 track session, including a
rampant Kingdom, renders the best
part of the evening over in my
opinion. But not the schoolies. who
see them off for their heroes.
And it has to be said, their heroes
were good. But who can go wrong
with a crowd of adoring fans giving
anything for a swig of their mineral
water (despite recent
hospitalisation...). At least it
guarantees the band will be caught
when they dive - so where's the
fun?
But giving credit. Eat gave what
was wanted (projectors et al). A n d
it was totally lapped up. But
Candyland gave the music, and to
no appreciation, which sums it up.
So where's the fault in being
resoundingly bitter?

Phonefreak Honey? What is this all
about? First listen: What is she on
about? Second listen: What is she
singing'.' Two thousand listens later.
I still don't know. I have a fear
though, that this band are a group
of potential shoegazers. just waiting
to leap out and look at their shoes
in front of you. They're reminiscent
of Lush and Strawberry
Switchblade (Remember them?
Lush. 1 mean. E v e r y b o d y
remembers Strawberry
Switchblade.) Having said that
though, this is certainly one catchy
nine... Phonefreak Honey, na. na.
nana. na. na. nana...

Catherine Wheel: Next time, can you keep your eyes open?
singing the chorus on its own for
another two minutes over a
background of noises produced by
passing the output from your guitar
through at least five effects pedals.
4. Finally stop after another
minute of feedback and hissing
from your amp.
At all times the vocal must be just
audible but not so loud that you can
hear the words.
Alternatively, change your name
to something crap and hum along
to a dated house beat for three
minutes and sell millions of copies.
Strangely this is quite good.
Really.
Pebbles.
A guide to making a record, mark
one.
1. Write two verses and a chorus,
making sure the chorus has lots of
long and dreamy words.
2. Sing said verses and chorus for
three minutes and then appear to be
winding down so that the audience
(hink you're going to stop.
3. Fool them completely by

slagged unless absolutely
necessary." I find it hard to justify
not slagging them. In fact I slept
through half the concert. That must
tell you how truly engaging this
band are. They're not too bad on
record mind.
O h . and by the way. Coventry is
the pits of the earth, it's cold, the
ring road is harder to drive round
than Hyde Park Corner in the rush
hour, the whole place is an
architectural nightmare, there is
only one good shop (reprieved for
selling Ermintrude socks) and the
polytechnic couldn't organise a gig
to save their lives, they're worse
than IC Ents. Incredible but sadly
true. I'm not going North of The
Gap again if I can help it.

Coventry Poly? Coventry Poly!
What on earth is a review of a gig
at Coventry Poly doing in this
week's Felix? W e l l . I was just
passing through, and seeing as Redd
Kross hit London next week. I
thought a review might interest you.
Redd Kross are a bubblegum
psychedelia band. I know. I read the
press release. Redd Kross are
supporting Teenage Fanclub. Redd
Kross are American. Consequently
