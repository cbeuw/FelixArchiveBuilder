Are those painted polystyrene cups I see before me? STOIC s attempt at the cheap and tacky fell short of BBC I '$ effortless inanity.

team for one specific programme,
that way you would not have to
spend too much time at all working
for STOIC—maybe as little as an
hour every two weeks. If you were
interested in getting more involved
you could apply for one of the three
committee posts that are vacant.
The P r o m o t i o n s Officer is
responsible for the station's image
and getting contestants and
audiences for the various shows, the
Publicity Officer is responsible for
ensuring that Imperial College
knows about all o f S T O l C ' s
transmissions and the Archivist's
brief is to keep all the material
STOIC collects catalogued and
stored so as to be easily accessible.
These posts will be elected at a
general meeting in about ten days.
Finally, to all those people in
college who so easily dismiss
S T O I C as being a low quality and
waste of time let me say this: it is
a broadcasting fact that it takes 20
times more time per second to make
a television programme than it does
a radio programme. Bearing this in
mind I think that the few dedicated
people who run S T O I C are doing
an excellent job and it is about time
that a few more people appreciated
just what was being done for them.
If you still don't believe me then go
to the studio and help to make a
programme, then you will realise
what goes on behind the scenes and
how difficult it is to make the
shortest, simplest broadcast.
STOIC currently
broadcasts to all
campus halls of
residence.
