The characters are:
Miss Peacock Blue
Miss Scarlett Red
Mrs White Guess

him when you see him
Prof. Plum Purple
G r i m Reaper Black

The weapons are:
Revolver
Dagger
Rope
Lead Pipe Theta
Spanner Spanner & Bolt
Candlestick Davy
Anyway at each of the locations
there will be either one of the
characters or one of the weapons.
When you think that you have
spotted one of them ask them. ' D o
you need roll-on deodorant?'. If you
Winged
Fellowship
H o l i d a y s f o r d i s a b l e d p e o p l e .
have the right person then you will
get a signature on your clue sheet
and a clue as to W H Y the murder
happened. The bearer of any of the
weapons will give you a signature
but no clue. If you don't have the
right person...
There will be a 'Secret Passage'
mini-bus driving around between
the various locations. The path that
it takes will be totally at the
discretion of the driver.
Oh. by the way. if you are having
trouble working out the clues, the
marshalls are eminently bribeable
(currency units being 1 pint).
If you find D r Black (the dead
guy) cavorting with the G r i m
Reaper then you have found the
scene o f the crime. T o find who
dunnit and using what weapon you
have to visit every location on the
board and work out which character
and which weapon are missing. I
should mention at this point that
none o f the C C U mascots were
involved. They will be making an
appearance at some random
location at some random time and
if you happen to be there at the same
time as one o f them, you get bonus
points.
Did I mention treasure? When
you think you know why Penguin
was assassinated (jealousy is not
sufficient) then your team can act
out a short sketch illustrating your
brainwave. If you have collected
any relevant 'treasure' (no not
traffic cones or shopping trolleys)
along the way you will get extra
points for using them as props.
On the subject of points; here is
how they work:
lpt—for each pound collected
(divided by team size)
lOpts—for each location signature
(50 if mascot was there)
25pts—for right place
50pts—for right assassin
Points are double for a full set o f
signatures
Max 50 pts for sketch
There will be separate prizes for
most points and highest collector.
Finally; don't forget to collect
lots o f money along the way. Get
out there and have a party!
