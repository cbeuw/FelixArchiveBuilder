31 January 1992 Felix 924 Editorial
editorial
Free speech is an unpredictable
animal. It is dangerous, often brutal
and often messy. It also has a
tendency to bite the user. There is
the belief in this country that free
speech is acceptable, but always
with the unwritten caveat unless it
attacks me. This is why certain
College people get so irate when
something appears in Felix of which
they do not approve - if you, the
reader, want Felix to comment on
the running of the College, the
Union or the Government, you. the
reader, have to put up with
comments you do not approve of.
For instance. and totally
hypothetically, if one o f the Union
clubs or societies acquires a piece
of extremely expensive equipment,
thus reducing the budget for other
clubs or societies, is the first loyalty
of this newspaper to the club with
the expensive equipment?
Publicising the fact may attract the
attention of thieves, it may damage
the Union, and some would say by
so doing student's interests are
damaged. Equally, is loyalty due to
other clubs who now cannot buy
what they wanted? O r is it to the
general student populace?
In truth, there is no loyalty factor.
If it is news, it should be publicised,
irrespective of the effect, as it
cannot be ascertained beforehand
what the effect is. This is, o f
course, an ideal, as Felix in no way
publicises everything, though
aiming for some ideal is better than
drifting. What appears in Felix is
an expression of free speech - take
it or leave it, agree or disagree,
respond or remain in a miffed
silence, but I will not entertain the
notion that anything in Felix should
not have gone in. If mistakes are
made, then you should help correct
them - or even better, help us avoid
them by telling us what you know.
News Integration.
To aid the integration o f news
stories coverage within College, IC
Radio, S T O I C (television) and
Felix have agreed to interchange
news on a regular basis. The
structure of this integration has been
arranged mainly by Jonty Beavan,
the Felix news editor, Declan
Curry. I C Radio's answer to Jorn
Corl at Wastminsterrr and Dave
Henderson-B, S T O I C business
manager. They have also given it
a provisional name - the College
News Network, or C N N . They will
not go down in history as the
world's greatest punners, but this
co-operation is long overdue, I
sincerely hope it continues.
In a similar manner, the first
edition of the Directory of British
Student Newspapers is now on sale
at £6.50 a copy. This is the result
of a survey conducted over about
180 student unions in the country,
to which about sixty responded,
asking for information into their
student newspapers. It is to be
hoped that this will aid integration
of current affairs relevant to
students across a wider area.
Apologies are due in respect of
the delay in the travel special. This
is because a few articles came in
late, and I could not arrange 24
pages to be printed in time. I
particularly apologise to the
societies from the far east to whom
I promised a double page spread
this week - it will go in next week,
and I think it will look good.
Grease.
I thoroughly recommend the
readership to go and see 'Grease'
in the Great Hall tonight and over
the weekend. Y o u will not be able
to tell how good or .bad it is unles
you have seen it and though there
were problems on the opening
night, there is the possibility that
these will be ironed out by now.
The tickets are only £ 4 with an I C
student card. I hope the crew and
cast are enjoying the experience.

What is this 1 hear around College
that I am none other than the red
headed lady of the night. M s Sam
Cox. I would just like to say that
these rumours are totally unfounded
and that although she is one of my
main informants she and I are not
one. A s to the revealing o f my true
identity. I am Marge, there is no
one else involved.
On to the subject of gossip around
College, well let me think. A h yes.
the party at Trig and C o s flat.
Well, well Poddy. I didn't think you
had it in you me old mucker, and
with a damn yank to boot. Slightly
hypocritical don't you think, mind
you beggars can't be choosers can
they. O h and as an after thought.
Trigger the reason they don't go for
you but chose people like Poddy is
clear. It's the mystery, you make it
clear that you want a shag, he
makes it clear that he wants to talk
about it for an hour or two first.
(Slightly in-joke there, apologies.)
As to everything else. I think
there are a few people around
College who are rather upset that
Steve 'Hon Sec' Farrant got off scot
free from his mindless attempt at
asserting his authority the other
Friday, and I don't mean certain
Felix staff or casual employees of
the Union. Lets face it. if a student
had performed such a mindless act
d u r i n g a bar extension and
inebriated to the same level that I
understand M r . Farrant was. they

would have been banned from the
Union building for at least a term
if not having to face a disciplinary
at the same time. It brings into light
the old saying 'look after your own'
(Joesn't it? A n d talking of looking
after your own. W h y should the
only person who has kept the bar
running over the last few months
been the one who has had to resign?
Surely it is time for the Union to
take a good look at itself and decide
once and for all what they are there
for. T o care for the students or to
care for themselves.
I have just heard from a reliable
source that a certain Guilds person
has taken to watching hard core
porn videos. Miss Kate.B. the
roving eye has caught you out!
And a cryptic message to Miss
