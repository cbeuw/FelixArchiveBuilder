Feature Felix 924 31 January 1992
'The Phoenix' was the College's
onl\ magazine from its inception
during the latter part of the last
century until 1949, when 'Felix'
was founded. Rumour has it that
'The Phoenix,' then known as the
'Science Schools Journal.' was
founded b) H G Wells, the early
science fiction author, whilst he was
at the Royal College of Science
studying zoology. 'The Phoenix'
performed the same function then
as "Felix" does now. to inform the
College and by so doing giving it
a sense of identity, and though 'the
Phoenix' still exists, coming out
annually, it now contains the
literary efforts of the College staff
A play in Three Acts, and an
Epilogue.
Place: The Organic Laboratory.

The noble Lord Al-Khali enters
through a reflux condenser at the
head of his army of anions. They
fight the demon desperately. For a
while things look very black, then
they look brown, then red. then

opalescent. 'Forsooth, my well-
beloved.' sighs Esther, 'though hast
comforted me. Thy very presence
inspireth me with confidence;
gladly will I take thee as my wedded
husband.'
(Exit the demon, fuming.)

entries should be handed in to the
Felix Office, Beit Quad, as soon as
possible.

Phoenix' of 1922-23, under the
editorship of M r B . Drinkwater
( B . S c . F . I . C . . A . R . S . M . .

world - Europe was four years out
of one of the most hideous wars
mankind had ever inflicted on itself
and Imperial College had certainly
lost many people in it. There was
a general air of pulling-things-
together and smiling-in-the-face-of-
adversity, which is often reflected
in the writing of the time.
It is interesting to note the writing
style. We live in a pictorially literate
age; we are used to images, be it
television or full colour newspaper
pictures. In 1922 they had no such
diversions and all images had to be
broadcast through the pen. This led
to sentences which, by today's
standards, are immensely long,
contorted and picturesque.

Since the last issue the Imperial
College has been affiliated to the
National Union of Students. As this
organisation is of recent foundation,
a brief statement as to its origin and
objects will not be out of place.
At the re-opening in 1919 of the
University of Strasbourg, a French
Institution, representatives from the
Universities of Allied and ex-
neutral countries were invited in
order to discuss International
Student relations.
This led to the foundation shortly
afterwards, of the Confederation
Internationale des Etudiants. most
European countries, with the
exception of the Central Powers.
joining immediately.
Unfortunately. England had no
organisation which could claim to
represent the Students o f this
country, and so the English
Students were merely allowed to
attend the meetings in an unofficial
capacity and could not vote.
T h i s difficulty was again
experienced at the First C L E .
Congress held at Prague in 1921.
when Scotland, whose Students
were officially represented joined
the Confederation independently.
The result of this Conference was
the formation of the National Union
of Students in February. 1922.
Most of the Universtities in the
country affiliated immediately, and
now after less than one year, every
University and University College
in the country, with one exception,
is represented on the N . U . S .
Council.
The objects of the N . U . S . are 'the
national and international
representation of the Students of this
country.' In view of the present
chaotic state of affairs in Europe,
it is important that students should
have some knowledge o f the
conditions and life o f other
nationalities with a view to a better
mutual understanding in the future.
The fact that the Imperial College
has joined independently has been
instrumental in bringing to the
notice of other Universities the
position and aims of the College,
and it is of the greatest importance
that the Imperial College should not
be missing from a movement that
every other University in the
country is taking part.

There is much rejoicing; the
kations and the anions give a
wonderful display of tautomeric
dances. The bride and bridegroom
arrive with much bubbling; the flask
fluoresces and the anions throw
themselves in a flocculent mass at
the bridegroom's feet. The couple
leave for a refractometer on their
honeymoon.

We are pleased to announce that the
United Grand Lodge of England has
granted the petition of about thirty
old students and members of the
Staff and Governing Body for the
formation of the Imperial College'
Lodge o f Free and Accepted
Masons. The date of consecration
is not yet fixed.
Extract from tlie May 1923 issue.
W e have received a letter
expressing not a little
disappointment at the omission
from the Memorial Tablets, shortly
to be unveiled in the Colleges, of
the names o f those o f the
"subordinate staff" (cleaners,
labourers and the like), who fell in
the common cause. We cannot see
that such distinction need to be
drawn, and consider the grievance
a legitimate one. Perhaps it is even
now not too late to do something in
the matter.
Editorial extract. February 1922
\ letter reached us a few days back
addressed to "The Editor of the
Felix Magazine." We regret to have
lo say that, judged by comparison
w ith previous Sessions, our position
lo-day hardly justifies such a title
in fact, we may say that hardly
since the post-War resumption o f
publication we have felt less 'felix.'
Whether or not we have submerged
in the general depression it is
impossible to say; the fact remains
that our 'grip' on our readers, at no
time a very fixed quantity, has
relaxed to an alarming extent.
Towards the end of 1921. we were
beginning to say 'Every day. and in
even way. we are ... e t c ' The
reception o f our C h r i s t m a s
Number, however, considerably
dented our optimism, and our
enthusiasm has waned steadily
since. Briefly, then, the facts are
these:- the number of individuals
writing for our Magazine more or
less regularly scarcely reaches 20,
while in the matter of sales it is a
great struggle to make ends meet.
And this is a College boasting at
least a thousand students. Our only
consolation, if such it be, lies in the
fact that a glance here and there at
other 'activities' shows them to be
in much the same unsatisfactory
position. There is an air of general
apathy afoot (if we may so put it).
T o improve matters somewhat,
therefore, we have reduced the
number of pages in the issue, and
regret that several articles and
notices of books have been held
over.
Editorial extract, May 1922.
Someone has remarked, in what the
newspaper reporter invaribly terms
a few well chosen words," the
tendency of young man's fancy at
this period of the year. A short time
time since our post-prandial
sauntering led us through ther
Brompton Churchyard, where we
observed a man and maid in earnest
consultation. The words referred to
above flashed across o u r
recollection. Here, surely, was
material confirmation o f the
statement. Our path took us past the
couple. What she said will perhaps
never be known - in any case it is
not evidence. His reply reached her
and us almost simultaneously. It
was ' Y e s , dear, if you are on the
same wave-length.' W e tell this
story, which is "Nothing but the
Truth.' as indicating the firm hold
which today's Ruling Passion has
upon the community. W e note the
erection of a workmanlike aerial on
the Union premises. Is this a
foretaste when lectures will be
delivered by the Staff, cosily
esconsed in armchairs in the Botany
Bay. to the Students, similarly
disposed in the main building? The
system w i l possess undisputed
advantages - to the student, who
will leave the lecture at will without
disturbing the speaker, and to the
lecturer, who will no longer need
to conceal the source o f his
information. Thus will Humanity
unostentatiously enter into
Education, on both sides.
