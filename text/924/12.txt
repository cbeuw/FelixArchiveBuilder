31 January 1992 Felix 924 Music
Because some bastard pressed an
emergency stop button and the lifts
at Russell Square weren't working
properly we were nearly half an
hour late arriving at U L U . Puffing
and panting, we wandered in and
were met and soon ushered into the
changing rooms.
The Sensitize Interview, part one
Paul (the guitarist) and James (the
d r u m m e r ) both come from
Cumbria, as do the other two
members of the band that we had
left in the bar. After the rather
traditional hard start where both
sides are a little edgy we soon got
into the flow.
'What do you think of London
then'.'" was. I thought, an original
question.
'We've lived in London for a
year and a half, there's no going
back", they want to get away from
the wilds of the North West where
they feel there are no people,
especially not musically. The desire
to break with the nine to five
mentality seems almost a pre-
requisite for being in a band these
days.
Being friends at school, even pre-
school, they seem to be looking for
'a way out of what we had before,
like 'real jobs' and the small town
existence". It's their p r i m e
motivation, although that's not to
say they have no ambition. They
want to go everywhere, they want
to 'happen' and they believe they
will.
They have been supporting
Kingmaker on the 'Idiots at the
Wheel' tour, so I asked with a
knowing smile, 'what plans have
you for the future'.
'Well the second single comes out
in M a r c h ' , and they are at the
moment doing a mini headline tour
in some of the smaller clubs. It's
just the start of the hard slog that
they need to do to get the fan base,
it's the only way to get bring long
term success, they feel.
At this stage there was a small
discussion about what sort of drum
sticks the drummer uses on tour and
the fact that I've always wanted to
learn to drum. Stories about
covering garages with egg boxes in
vain attempts not to annoy the
neighbours, all very interesting at
the time, but not why we were
there.
The Sensitize Interview, part two
T know its a really crap question,
but where did the name come
from?"
'Well it wasn't from us.' It seems
that when you sign to Food they
almost insist that you change your
name. They've had millions of
names: 'Pop City Maniacs' for one.
i Y o u send a list of names, the record
company send you a list of names
and then you negotiate. 'There's a
lot o f shit names', 'but if we'd
signed as Sensitize we would
probably of ended up being called
Pop City Maniacs'. The first few
London gigs they did they used a
different name for every night.
They didn't seem that fused about
the name: it 'just grows on you'.
Then we got onto the real reason
for them doing the interview, the
current single. Its a nice bouncy
melody that does nobody no harm,
but what's it all about?
'It's nothing to do with the
sleeve', the Andy Warhol serial
killers. The real story is that at one
gig when they were really crap the
lead singer (Mark) was so pissed of
with the sound and the audience that
he just said 'fuck this' and dropped
(or threw) his guitar which broke
in two. The other three had to carry
on.
At the precise moment that I
thought I was on a roll, there was
a knock on the door and in came the
man from the T-shirt company.
After twenty seconds of chat he
started talking to me and when he
left we had the impression he
thought I was in the group. T
wouldn't mind...is it a good life?'.
Which brought us onto the more
personal side of the group.
The Sensitize Interview, part
three
'The sex. drugs and rock and roll',
'when we're on tour we spot trees'
offered James. 'Bullshit." We have
debauched lifestyle, we snort coke'
countered P a u l . There then
followed a discussion amongst the
two group members about wether
they take drugs. Paul maintaining
that they had the typical myth
lifestyle of a group and James
saying that they didn't have enough
money to take drugs and all they
could do was read books on trees.
'We shag everything', was the
comment that seemed to shut up
James, 'sorry, I take that back'.
There then passed a few seconds
before the reconciliatory comment
'we shag trees' passed from Paul's
lips. They said they were tree lovers
and that the favourite tree, the 'tree
of the month' was the Scotch Pine.
It then degenerated into a general
chit-chat and then into us being
ushered out into the masses that had
started spewing into the halls. What
did 1 think of them? They should do
well if. and it is a big if, they can
make their material distiguishable
from the other 'indie guitar bands'
around at the moment. Good luck
and watch out for those trees.

Sensitize.
Not Pop City Maniacs
Sensitize: At least one of them is photogenic.
