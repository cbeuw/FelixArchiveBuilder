Icicle Balloon Meet
D i d you see a copy of The Sunday
Times on January 5th? Well if you
did y o u may have seen the
photograph of the 'Icicle Balloon
Meet' in the sports section, which
pictured the Imperial College Hot
A i r balloon alongside the Cadbury's
Creme Egg balloon.
Members of the I C Balloon club
attended the 20th 'Icicle Balloon
Meet' held at Marsh Benham near
N e w b u r y and enjoyed the
unexpected flying. It was only on
the Friday evening that the weather
reports were mentioning gales.
Therefore it was with surprise that
we arrived at the field at sunrise,
along with about 80 other balloons
and their crews, and realised that
the wind had completely dropped.
At the briefing the organisers
suggested that it was likely to get
windy again later in the morning
and so everyone inflated their
balloons and took off without much
delay.
Those who weren't in the balloon
followed it along the country lanes
towards the village of Hermilage
where our balloon landed. The
balloon had been flying generally in
a north-easterly direction, that o f
the predominant w i n d . After
visiting the farmer who owned the
grass field where the balloon
landed, packing away the balloon
and refuelling the gas tanks, we
then headed off for breakfast. After
lunch the weather was still calm, so
we flew again, along with many of
the other balloons.

Rugby
IC Rugby's 1st X V progressed to
the last sixteen o f the U A U
Championship on Wednesday after
a convincing win over the London
School o f Economics. Such a
commanding win was long overdue
after some disappointing
performances before Christmas.
B i c k n e l l maintained his
impressive try scoring record with
4 tries in this 78-9 thrashing. Others
scorers included Botton (3 tries).
Pearson (2) and D Flemming. The
1 st X V now face Reading at home
and hope to reverse the result of
their encounter earlier in the season.
The 2nd X V lost 12-4 to Q M C W
after injuries to both their team as
well as being weakened by players
being promoted to the 1st X V
squad.
PS: David Flemming would like to
know who made the mess in his
pants while he was wearing them on
Wednesday 22nd January in or
around Southside Bar.
Solar
many large meets held all over the
country, as well as flying regularly
near Newbury. So if you are
interested in finding out more about
Hot A i r Ballooning, come along to
the Thursday lunchtime meetings in
the Southside Upper Lounge (above
the bar) at 1pm where you can sign
up for the next trip.

The ultimate student project: A
small solar sail which could easily
be stowed on board the space shuttle
to be unfurled into space. The sail
could be tracked across the Solar
System, leading to the possibility of
a Whitbread round Mars race at
some point in time.
Colin Jack, whose company is
championing the idea, will discuss
the project on Saturday February
1st, beginning 7.30pm, in Elec Eng
403B. A l l are welcome.

Malaysian Sports Carniva
On Saturday 18th January members
of the Imperial College Malaysia
Society travelled d o w n to
Nottingham University as part of
the University of London contingent
for the Nottingham Sports Carnival.
This annual event was attended by
twelve participating Malaysian
Societies from all over the U K .
The day began as early as 8am in
the morning as a coach load o f
Malaysians crept out of sleepy
London. The two and a half hour
journey was spent either catching up
on lost sleep or watching the action
thriller ' N i c o ' on the video. It was
about 1 l a m when the coach pulled
up next to the N o t t i n g h a m
University Sports Centre.
Coach loads of Malaysians had
already arrived from all everywhere
and the place was crawling with
Malaysians. The air was filled with
strange greetings in Barasa
Malaysia (national language of
M a l a y s i a ) c o u p l e d w i t h the
accommodating British accent
which virtually everyone had
pitched onto by now. The scene in
the sports centre itself was like one
out as 'Kotaraya' (a famous mall in
Malaysia where young people hang
out).
Soon everyone was split up as the
various games were being played
simultaneously. Scrabble and
badminton were among the first
events to be played. In both events
the London team made its way to
the semi-finals and quarter-finals
respectively before being narrowly
beaten. In the badminton the IC pair
of E L Tan and Hakim put up a good
fight before going down in the
quarter-finals.
Meanwhile squash and indoor
football were already w e l l
underway. In squash a l l the
Londoners made it through to the
second r o u n d . Later in the
tournament, Kannarudin ( L S E )
clinched the title for London.
Football however proved to be a bit
of a disappointment as the London
team crashed out in the early
rounds.
As the games were going on there
was lots of time for catching up with
old friends and acquaintances. A
wide variety of Malaysian cuisine
was also on sale at reasonable prices
for those craving for a taste of home
food, indeed a pleasant change from
ones own cooking.
Among the last of the events was
the volleyball matches which can be
said to be the highlight event of the
day. The Londoners put up a
tremendous effort and stayed in the
event right up to the semi-finals,
before losing narrowly to the
Nottingham team in a close match.
T h o u g h disappointed. the
Londoners took the results (11-10)
in good spirits.
After exchanging addresses,
telephone numbers and such, we
bade farewell to our hosts and
fellow Malaysians before our long
ride back to London. It was almost
2am Sunday morning as we queued
for the night buses in Trafalgar
Square before heading our
respective ways.
Overall it can be said a successful
outing and a good laugh was had by
all. A n enjoyable weekend with a
couple of blisters and a few
pulled-muscles.
