The Fat Lady Sings Pele - Megalomania
- Clapham Grand
Well then. Y o u weren't there were
you? Poddy told you to go. and we
were there. Where were you?
Anyway, we had a great time. I
can remember that much. A n d the
lead singer had a truly disgusting
shirt on. I can remember that too.
I just can't seem to remember that
much about the concert. I
remember being filmed during one
song, possibly the anthemic single,
Arclight. I remember being frozen
stiff for the first hour or so. I
remember thinking they were better
at Reading. I remember Reading
quite well. I remember enjoying
myself. I just don't remember that
much about the actual performance.
It was good though. I know that.

Having finally recovered from
playing IC. Pele release their
second single. In comparison to
Raid The Palace, and their live
performances, this is more
restrained, with none of the
former's vitriol, none of its anti-
aristocracy rant. I think it's just
about a relationship. I had expected
more.
And if the debut single can get
play listed on Radio One for five
weeks and not chart, I can't see this
changing that. O f course, this
means that now I've said this, it will
go to number one lor three years.
Go on. wind me up. buy it. see if
1 care.

They're nor fat, they're not ladies. They can sing.
Kingmaker - ULU
When our illustrious music editor
told me he could get me into a
Kingmaker gig free I jumped at the
chance. The chance for a night
away from " M u n i c h Philharmonic
plays A b b a " would lead me to go
and see a small, squeaky Australian
by the name of Minogue if it was
free! Well, maybe I wouldn't go
that far. but I like Kingmaker so I
jumped at the chance.
First up. Blab Happy. The free C D
single that I got with my Kingmaker
top had a lovely picture of the band
on the front. The C D itself is blue
and red. Quite natty really. Haven't
listened to it yet. Anyway, back to
the gig. For a second support, they
were really very good, plenty of
people took an interest. They had
a good range of songs, and once
they've ironed out the rough edges,
they'll make a very good live band.
Sensitize. Well all I can say is that
Ermintrude the cow would probably
say 'It all sounds a bit samey to me.'
And it did to me too. A l l the songs
seemed to run into each other. I was
kept interested by the stagediver
who managed to push the guitarist
into the drumkit, causing a minor
amount of mayhem. Apart frofrj
that, nothing special.
On to Kingmaker. I'm trying not
to be biased because I like them, so
here goes. They were brilliant.
Only a year since their first e.p. and
they are selling out U L U . Not bad,
eh? Every time I listen to 'Really
Scrape the Sky' I am amazed by the
bass line. A n d the drumming. Well
that just has to be seen to be
believed. They played a hour long
set made up of songs from their
current (only!) album and a few
'oldies' from previous E P ' s . topped
off with an encore that finished with
The Pockets of St. Malachi'. which
always leaves the crowd gasping for
breath.
When I listen to them, I often try
to describe the sound. A n d I don't
usually get very far. One of their
songs sounds a bit U2\sh, but that
shouldn't put you off. The rest of
them don't.
Tonto
World Of Twist
- She's A Rainbow
stereo blaring. Consequently, I am
rather worried by their decision to
release it in February. Fortunately
it was sunny last Sunday, so we did
it a n y w a y . U n f o r t u n a t e l y .
Knightsbridge was solid, and in no
fit state for cruising along. Never
mind.
A fine uplifting Rolling Stones
cover, baggy and bouncy, the single
is the one for World Of Twist. And
the B-side is one of the better tracks
from Quality Street. Lose My Way.
All we can hope for is a mild
winter. Superb.
Lise Yates.
"One glaring omission is She's A
Rainbow which is criminal." Felix
915.
Told you so. told you so. In an
effort to get time off for good
behaviour. Circa have now decided
to release She's A Rainbow as a
single. T h i s is an excellent
summery track for cruising down
Knightsbridge with the roof down.
