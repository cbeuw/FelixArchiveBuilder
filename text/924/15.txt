Feature Felix 924 31 January 1992
Student Television of Imperial
C o l l e g e ( S T O I C ) has been
broadcasting now for twenty two
years. It's a service run by students
for students and it's getting bigger
and better all the time, which is why
it now needs your help. From
Monday 3rd February. STOIC will
be broadcasting every weekday
evening. Using live relays of
programmes available on the
S T O I C satellite receiver the idea is
to p r o v i d e an evening o f
entertainment, every evening, using
programmes that most people
would not be able to watch.
STOIC currently broadcasts to all
campus halls of residence, barring
unavoidable technical difficulties,
and programme output is greater
than ever before. Last term the
news was regularly broadcast on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, and
Thursday evening's 'Into the night'
brought y o u a diversity^ o f .
programmes from the quiz show
'Going for Coppers' to coverage of
the Lord Mayor's Show, in which
the City & Guild College Union
participated. Also last term, we saw
the introduction o f 'Nostalgia
N i g h t ' . a c o m p i l a t i o n o f
programmes from the large S T O I C
archive.
This term S T O I C is working on
many new t e l e v i s i o n shows
including ' N E X T ! ' , an
improvisation show in the same

vein as 'Whose line is it anyway
and "McRusky and Starch', a
tonuge in cheek seventies police
drama. Also in the pipeline are a
science-fiction drama, a serious
quiz to find the 'Mastermind' of
Imperial College, a bi-weekly
satirical look at current news and a
debating programme.
Now at this point I can here all
those cynics out there making
comments about how S T O I C never
broadcasts anything decent and no
one can watch it anyway. Well that
is precisely why there are so many
changes taking place. O n the
technical side of things, possibilities
to enable more and more people to
watch STOIC are continuously
being explored. For example, the
idea o f putting television in
departmental common rooms or
induction loops in halls so S T O I C
can be received in the individual
rooms is being discussed. Also,
ideas are always being put forward
to solve the technical nightmare that
would let S T O I C reach Evelyn
Gardens (the technical manager was
at one time seriously considering
taping coaxial cabling to the
pavement with gaffer tape to do it).
N o w . the real problem is
manpower. There simply are not
enough members of STOIC to allow
all these ideas to be put into effect.
There are even three places on the
committee waiting to be filled.
People are needed in all fields. Take
the two weekly news programmes.
As a new era of cooperation
between the internal media begins
there are vacancies for reporters,
editors, script-writers and
presenters. The dramas require
production teams to help with set
building, directing, filming and post
production. The quiz shows require
contestants and maintenance needed
to keep the network and the studio
running as well as the initiation of
special projects like those
mentioned above. A n d . of course,
we need people to staff the evening
transmissions. In fact there is room
for everyone at S T O I C (not
physically of course, the premises
are actually quite small).
Therefore, what S T O I C is now
asking, is that anyone who is even
remotely interested in any of the
things mentioned above (yes, even
being an audience) comes up to
their studio on the third floor of the
Union Building in Beit Quad to
have a look around and have a chat.
If you want to help, you will be
given a comprehensive instruction
in how to use all of the professional
equipment that resides in the STOIC
studio including vision mixers,
effects generators, editing
machines, sound desks, everything.
After that you could specialise.
