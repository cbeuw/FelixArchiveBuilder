Chope Con Parents
J u n i o r transport minister
Christopher Chope visited IC
yesterday at the invitation of the
I C U Conservative Society. He
described the National Union of
Students ( N U S ) as a closed shop
which the Conservative party had
come close to resolving. He added
that the government had
encountered legal problems in their
efforts to reform the N U S . M r
Chope said that membership of the
N U S should be an individual matter
and added that students should be
able to opt in or out of their college
unions.
The minister's comments appear
to be at variance with a recent ruling
of the European court. Following
a dispute in which two students at
the Birmingham College of Food
and Tourism withdrew from the
Plug
Free Tickets can still be obtained
for the Faraday Lectures to be held
in the Barbican Centre on 6th
February. The tickets can be
obtained from the press and public
relations office in room 553 o f the
Sherfield building.
The Rector. Sir Eric A s h . has
rejected the recommendation by
Gordon Marshall, Director of
Estates, to contract out College
security and messenger services to
private tender.
After a long period of discussion
among senior College management,
a letter was released last Friday
stating that changes had to be made
to the security and messenger
services. The letter said that
security should remain in-house if
A recent survey has found that
fewer students are dropping out
from higher education courses
despite increased financial hardship.
The study, conducted by higher
education chiefs, also implies that
self-financing students work harder.
The result is seen as a victory for
the supporters of the student loan
scheme. Under the old grants
system, 4% of students in higher
education left their courses early.
The recent freezing of grants and
college student union, the European
court ruled that students' unions
formed an integral part of college
life. The minister commented that
it was not for the European court
to dictate to students' on whether
they should be members o f college
student unions.
A spokesman for the Department
of Education and Science told the
College News Network ( C N N ) that
he could not comment on any of the
matters raised by M r . Chope. He
pointed out that the Birmingham
case was not a government matter
and that M r . Chope was speaking
at Imperial C o l l e g e as a
C o n s e r v a t i v e , and not as a
government minister going outside
his area of responsiblility. N U S
officers were unavailable for
comment last night. (CNN).
Jump
Anyone who has not yet handed in
their deposits for the M E N C A P
Parachute Jump should do so by the
end of today (Friday). This should
be done at Rag meeting in the Ents
lounge in the Union at lunchtime or
after college hours in the Rag Office
(two floors above the Union bar).
a series of new conditions could be
met which included providing 24
hour security cover and a cost
saving. The College's Governing
Body has allowed a period o f two
weeks for differences to be worked
out.
The letter also stated that a
'discipline o f silence' should
surround the c o n t i n u i n g
negotaitions and because of this no
one wished comment about them.
introduction of various loan and
access funds is seen to have
motivated students to work harder
for courses that they are paying for
from their own pockets.
The National Union of Students
have stated that the system has led
to an average student debt of £600
outside London and £1,400 within.
One institution estimated that 60%
of it's students were still in debt the
following October.
A report in yesterday morning's
Guardian states that the Committee
of Vice Chancellors and Principals
( C V C P ) have claimed that 'half of
the parents earning over the national
average would be prepared to
contribute to their children's college
tuition fees'. A M O R I opinion poll
for the C V C P found that half of the
parents questioned who earned in
excess of £15.500,(figures quoted
from the Guardian) which is just
above the national average, would
be prepared to pay towards tuition
fees. The average they were willing
to pay was £1.000 a year. M O R I
polled 3.985 people.
The poll also revealed that 60
percent o f a l l the parents
i n t e r v i e w e d d i d not support
contributing to fees, and those that
were willing to contribute £1.000
actually represented less than 10
percent of the total.
The claim has been criticised for
its biased presentation of the results.

Fascist
There is growing evidence of fascist
activity amongst the British student
population. The West Midlands are
claimed to be an area where the
National Front continue to operate,
and a student from the Royal
H o l l o w a y and B e d f o r d N e w
C o l l e g e ( R H B N C ) caused
controversy last term when he
complained of 'mongrelisation by
ethnic minorities' during a Union
General Meeting. It is beleived that
the British National Party (BNP) is
targetting students in a new
recruitment campaign. (Warwick
Boar. University of Warwick,
Egham Sun, RHBNC and South
East Student. SE Area NUS).
Students at the Royal Veterinary
College in London are to be
charged for lecture handouts. This
follows a cut in the budget of one
of the departments leading to the
decision by the department that they
cannot afford free photocopies.
Each hand out will cost £2.50. and
students at the college are reported
to be worried about what else will
be charged for. (London Student.
University of London Union).
Pay
of the Association of University
Teachers ( A U T ) . is reported as
saying that 'the decision to survey
the preparedness of the well-heeled
middle class to contribute to tuition
costs does nothing to encourage
wider participation in higher
education.' Also, the National
Union of Students, according to the
article, pointed out that a third of
parents do not pay full contributions
to student's living costs.
• The C V C P has been criticised for
using students as 'pawns' by Justine
McGuiness. University of London
Union ( U L U ) Vice-President, as an
attempt to gain more government
funding. The C V C P have said that
they will charge students 'top-up'
fees if they do not get the required
funding. A Government spokesman
told the London Student, the U L U
newspaper, that 'the government
does not accept that universities are
underfunded.' (London Student.
ULU).
There will be examination stress
workshops in operation at the
Health Centre in Princes Gardens
from the 12th of February. The
workshops have been organised by
Claudio Calvi and will run for three
Wednesdays until the 26th
February. Anyone wishing to attend
is requested to call Jacqueline
Faridian (Practice Manager) in
advance. The extension number is
3099.
