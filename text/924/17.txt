Chapter II: Adjudication
(Part 2) by Troy Tempest.
The trumpets burst out with a
trumpet and Stress's ex-guide
entered the room, garbed as a jock.
He waved to the crowd as the dark
destroyer spoke.
'Eminent doctors have examined
this man and declared him brain
dead!"
The gallery groaned under the
despaired weight of the audience.
'Due to an extreme act of
violence!"
Cries of anguish cut the air.
'That's right folks. I'm officially
deceased."
The guide smiled modestly.
' A n d the culprit.'
The destroyer's monolithic face
avalanched down at Stress.
'Is him!!!'
The audience howled and roared
at Stress, thrashing and gnashing at
the small figure in the pit.
" W A I T ! '
A panther's roar swept away the
voices of the crowd. The torrential
voice of Regenerator boomed out.
i W A N T A G O . '
The people cowered down and
waited expectantly.
'So what that he has killed him?!
That witness isn't important!'
The crowds hung in indecision.
The guide's ball bearing voice
rolled out.
'But I might have been if he
hadn't killed me!'
The scales tipped to spill out
redoubled fury against the
defendant.
Peering from the edge of the pit
Stress watched as. one after
another, people he had met came in
with accusations and left with
applause. The procedure was
always the same, the dark destroyer
w o u l d incite the c r o w d ,
Regenerator would knock them into
indecision and then the witness
would incite them again. Finally
with trumpets. Stake entered and
announced that it was time for the
summing up.
The Inner
' W e l l . '
Thunder clouds rolled across the
voltmeter's forehead.
'What can I say?'
The foaming crowd slobbered in
expectancy.
'He simply has to die.'
The hero's breastplate silently
m i r r o r e d the rabid g a l l e r y .
Regenerator unconciously turned
his podium into a turtle as he sat in
thought.
' H e . '
Rainclouds obscured him.
'Has a pregnant wife?'
The crowd jeered at him before
quieting down as Stake strode to the
centre of the room.
'Bring on the clapometer!'
A n enormous thermometer was
dragged into the room and placed
beside the podium.
'Right then everybody, let's hear
it for the defence!'
The odd clap was smothered by
the mass abuse hurled at Stress.
' A n d for the prosecution!'
A n unrestrained-
cacaphony of
praise fireworked front the gallery.
The gallery exploded into shocked
Mobs and splinters.
'Which means.'
Stake twisted them with suspense.
'That.'
The super heroes loomed over
him.
' H E ' S G U I L T Y ! ! '
The c r o w d c o l l a p s e d with
cheering. Regenerator turned
System
himself into a giant lizard and loped
off. the Dark Destoyer smote
spectators in his zap of honour and
Stress tried to remember his
thoughts about death.
Stake absorbed the scene before
cutting in with.
' A n d now."
Stake grinned.
'It's sentence time!!'
' Y A A A A A A Y Y Y Y Y Y ! ! '
A bright garish wheel with
possible punishments engraved on
it was dragged in. The lights
dimmed and with a yank of his hand
Stake set the wheel spinning.
'Where will it land?'
The audience was silent.
'What terrible future awaits this
wretch.'
The wheel slowed, the clicking of
the catch on the segments becoming
sharp and clear.
'It's.'
The crowd suspended.
The wheel slid to a stop.
Stress gaped.
'Disco dancing for life!'
