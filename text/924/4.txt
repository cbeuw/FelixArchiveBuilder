Feature Felix 924 3'1 January 1992
So you survived Monopoly, so you
s u r v i v e d The Great L o n d o n
Sightseeing Tour, well; this time
play with death:
Penguin is dead. Who dunnit,
where, with what and...Why?
Beccy. his mourning wife is
offering thousands of prizes to
teams that will help her in the quest
to find the murderer, so get your
arse into gear and play Cluedo
tomorrow (or be square and watch
a spot of T V ) .
If you haven't been hungover for
the whole week, you should have
noticed the odd dead body outline
around Imperial College. If your IQ
is positive (in IC?), you mught have
associated them with this term's
Greatest. Meanest. C o o l e s t .
G r o o v i e s t . E x c e s s i v e . W i l d .
Freaky. Most Drunken rag event
yet.
So what's all this hype? and,
come to think of it, what's Cluedo
anyway? Remember Monopoly?
Well Cluedo uses the same concept,
take a small fry board game and
make it big. very big. London B i g !
Cluedo is based on the well known
board game...Cluedo. Those of you
who have never played Cluedo can
go home, or rather come and
redeem yourself this Saturday. The
main aim of our Cluedo is for you
to have fun, however, as a side-line.
Us A Cluedo
a bit of dosh for Rag would be
welcome. The money you collect
goes to Winged Fellowship, a
charity that gives disabled people a
chance to participate in activities
. that we take for granted such as an
afternoon of horse-riding or beach
trips. Furthermore, those nice
people at the charity with the nice
logo (see above) are offering a
computer to the Rag that raise the
most dough (no pun intended). Thus
there will be millions of other Rags
around that will come to the simply
kickin' party for all collectors later
that evening in the union. This also
means that altough we will be by far
the largest Rag around, we need
you to do some mean collecting! On
the subject of prizes, here is just a
taste of what's on offer for Y O U !
A dinner for two goes to the best
collector.
A free first pint—probably—to
every member of the winning team
(pointwise) on the Oxfam Firkins
Pub Leap (on 29th Feb).
A Rag mag to everybody
collecting over a pound!
And (if Scrooge pulls his finger
out!!) many more pressies.
Tiddlywinks was big but it hurt
your fingers. Monopoly was bigger
but not gory enough. The Great
Sightseeing Challenge was large but
where were the mascots? Answer:
they were warming up for the
biggest event o f them a l l ,
C L U E D O !
Be there, meet death, meet Theta,
Davey and S & B . meet the Cluedo
characters in the flesh (and get their
autograph), see Tamsin's sexy legs
(Again!!) and avenge the death of
the flat-footed-flightless-fiend
(Penguin).
Convinced yet?
O K , here is what you do:
Turn up in Beit Quad as soon as
possible after 10am on Saturday
with a team of about four or six
people.
At this point you will be given a
collecting tin and a clue sheet.
The object of the game is to visit
the nine locations around London
that are relevant to the rooms on the
Cluedo board. The catch here is the
fact that you have to work out. from
the clues, where these locations
actually are. For example the
library might be the British Library
(it's not!).
The rooms are:
Billiards Room
Dining Room
Conservatory
Ballroom
Kitchen
Library
Lounge
. Study
Hall
