P R O F I L E : T H E
1, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GUILDS'.
Recently married Keith M i l l e r i s perhaps the most
energetic and earnest of t h i s years Union Officers.
Last year his drive and enthusiasm r e v i t a l i s e d the
Overseas Students Sub-Committee; sent the Mount-
aineering Club rushing up the Alps, and i n i t i a t e d
the conception of an I.C. Exploration Board to
control and encourage expeditions of I.C. students
to remote corners of the Globe f o r s c i e n t i f i c and
survey purposes,

of Yugoslavia t h i s summer. He i s now able to shoot
a b i g l i n e as the only U.L.A.S. p i l o t to have flown
a Russian-built P.0.2. through the Communist skies
of Serbia. Aa President of Guilds' l a s t year his
f i r e and dash were summarily quenched i n the N.E.C,
horsetrough a f t e r an abortive attempt to recapture
Herbert. He had great d i f f i c u l t y i n preventing the
enraged Guildsmen from racing N.E.C. to the ground.
3. THE PRESIDENT OF R.C.S.
The face smiling cheerfully over the f u l l colours
t i e i s that of "Bugs" Guthrie, whose main interest
hitherto has been rowing f o r the f i r s t VIII. As a
prominent botanist, he has been suspected of conn-
ections with that now defunct subversive organis-
ation, the 29 Club.(No more red feet, please).
4. THE PRESIDENT OF MINES.——
Gazing dreamily into the distance i s another much
married man, Hugh Huckin. His interests have been
cars, women and rugger - probably not i n that order.
5. THE PRESIDENT OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE'S WOMENS Ass-
o c i a t i o n — — — — — —
The g i r l on the l e f t i s none other than Maureen
Hawes, the president of I.C.W.A. She i s actually
a chemist but i t i s rumoured that her interest i n
chemistry has migrated t o Cambridge.
6. THE PRESIDENT OF I.C.U.
The happy nan i n the middle i s Jim Anderson, some-
time President of R.C.S. and Captain of I.C. Soccer
Club. For further scurrilous details see the Red
Issue of FELIX.
7. THE SECRETARY OF I.C.U. AND CHAIRMAN OF THE
ATHLETIC CLUBS COMMITTEE. •
Staring uneasily from the right of the picture i s
S.A. Kitchener, a man of immense v e r s a t i l i t y as
indicated by his dual r o l e . last year, then Captain
of the I.C. Cricket Club, he scored a great personal
triumph with two magnificent centuries i n the Club's
unbeaten tour of Devon. While his a c t i v i t i e s are
largely sporting, we w i l l never forget his appear-
ance i n a recent stage production of "Orgia Romana".
£!je Sector's inaugural 8bbrestf, 1955
The Inaugural Address of Dr. Linstead, Rector
of Imperial College, was delivered i n the crowded
lecture theatre of the Royal Geographical Society
on Tuesday last under the Chairmanship of Viscount
Falmouth. It was not less remarkable f o r i t s wit
and elegance than f o r i t s p l a i n commonsense, and i t s
l u c i d exposition of the problems which confront us.
One l e f t the meeting astounded by the breadth of the
undertaking with which Dr. Linstead has to deal ;
and one marvelled at the understanding he showed
of i t .
At the moment the College produces one i n t h i r -
teen science graduates, and one i n nine technolog-
i s t s i n the country; and i s responsible f o r a greater
proportion of higher degrees than any other estab-
lishment. The problem of finding students so that
we might expand without milking other Colleges would
seem to be a b i g one. But Dr. Linstead has few dorfbts
about this f o r two reasons: f i r s t l y the great public
interest shown recently i n the teaching of science
(which has led to an offer of m i l i t a r y service def-
erment f o r science teachers); aneksecondly, the bulge
in the school-age population whiclr was brought about
by the war (when the American Servicemen were stat-
ioned i n B r i t a i n ) . In 1946 there were 1600,000 c h i -
ldren i n B r i t i s h schools-, by 1961 there should be
2700,000 . Our present annual intake of undergradu-
ates i s 500; but i n 1962, when we have 3000 Stu-
dents (1600 undergraduates), only 600 per annum w i l l
have to be recruited: an increase of 17%. Dr Linstead
also hopes to reduce the wastage by f a i l u r e . At the
moment 100 out of 500 annually f a i l t h e i r f i r s t year.
A course w i l l be established f o r "sixth Arts"
type people, so that i n a single year, beginning
with a knowledge of mathematics, they may reach or-
dinary entrance l e v e l i n Physics and Chemistry.
Last year, our 631 P.G.s were 34% of the stud-
ent body. In 1962 they w i l l constitute 45% of the
College. Of these, one t h i r d w i l l be overseas stud-
ents. Most of the rest w i l l be I.C. men, but there
w i l l be an increasing number of men from industry
doing short courses. There i s s t i l l a great deal of
money f o r the maintenance of P.Gs. The Rector hint-
ed to the appropriate people i n the audience that,
while he would not ask f o r money today, "there w i l l
be another day".
On the broadening of our Education, the Rector
regretted that the present three-year undergraduates
course would not allow any non-scientific studies t o
be included i n the formal curriculum. But extra-cur-
r i c u l a r a c t i v i t i e s , of the type instituted by the
late Rector, S i r Roderic H i l l , would be encouraged.
Amid cheers, Dr. Linstead, reminding the student that
he i s i n London, asked him to"expose himself to the
benign Influence of this most kindly of capital c i t i e s "
Dr. Linstead hopes that 300 students w i l l be i n
residence by 1962 - and t h i s w i l l constitute 16% of
the College. At the moment the comparable figures are:
out of London 28%, London 18%, I.C. 8%. For the other
84% Improved amenities, including a better Union
Library, were promised. The Union building w i l l be
finished i n a year's time. While these developments
are under way, the key i s "OPERATION SARDINE". Those
i n s t i t u t i o n s which suffer inconvenience by our ex-
pansion may remember, as a solace, that we are hav-
ing a very inconvenient time too.
When the Rector finished his speech, S i r Grahame
Cunningham moved a vote of thanks, which was seconded
by Jim Anderson.
We are given to understand that PHOENIX hopes
to publish the complete text of the Hector's Address
in the Autumn number. It w i l l certainly provide food
for a great deal of thought, apart from being most
welcome.
