THE ROYAL COLLEGE O
F SCIENCE
Welcomes its Freshmen
ON FRIDAY THE 6th. OCTOBER, THE ROYAL COLLEGE
OF SCIENCE COMMITTED THEIR ANNUAL FRESHERS RECEPT-
ION. OWING TO THE NIGGARDLY NATURE OF STUDENT GRANTS
A?"' TIE RISING COST OF LIVING, EVERYONE ARRIVED IN
A HIGHLY VORACIOUS MOOD,A N D T H E BUFFET WAS CONSUMED
WITH A RAPIDITY WHICH BODED ILL FOR THE DIGESTIVE
PROCESSES.
A pair of scavenging Guildsmen were observed
in the crush and Mr. Guthrie, the President of R.C.S.
rose up and publickly deplored their presence. These
Gentlemen were promptly given a bum's rush to the
door, i n which the Rector's wife netrrowly missed
being knocked f l a t . The intruders having been dealt
with s a t i s f a c t o r i l y , the speeches were begun i n r e l -
ative quiet. Miss Mary Clarke, f i r s t and only female
Vice-President, proposed the toast of "THE College"
in a speech that unfortunately did not carry to the
back of the H a l l . However, i t had a most enthusiastic
reception when declaimed l a t e r that night to a more
select group who drank whisky from china cups i n the
Harrington.
"The Freshers" was proposed by "Bugs* Quthrie, who observed
that his audienoe oould be divided into the invited Ereahjsra,
the invited Club offioers and the uninvited. The latter legen-
probably In the majority.
Vere Atkinson, contemplating "The Guests" after an
excess of sherry, was struck by the resemblance to the legom
dary characters involved in the Hunting of,the Shark. The
President of ICWA naturally reminded him of the Jubjuh for
As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,
Since i t lives i a perpetual passion:
It's taste in costume is entirely absurd-
It is ages ahead of the fashica.
I.CUnion Exeoutivas fared little better, Jim Andersen

as beavers, bakers, bankers,bander-snatches. The Rector, as
head of Imperial College did not ijuite f i t as the leader of the
Snarkhunter, the Bellman, who had
........ only one notion for crossing the ooean
And that was to tingle his bell
As Mr, Atkinson pointed out, the Hector had plenty of notions
and these did not include tingling. Indeed, those who had tingled
the bells of neighbouring institutions after midnight last term
received a vivid impression of the Rector's antipathy toward
tingling.
Prof. P.H. Gregory, replying for the guests, emphasised
how pleased they were with their reoeption, particularly Mr.
Miler and Mr. Huokin. The beer having run out prematurely, be-
cause R.C.S. are very thirsty this year, all adjourned to the
bar. As the President had warned, voices were raised in song.
Although two Guildsmen had already been evicted earlier in the
evening, R.C.S. oould not raise the manpower to kick out the
half dozen who ware found in the bar. At least two of the
Scientists were observed to be fraternising with their Guilds
colleages. A member of the FSUX staff, who had tried to
break up a Boomalaoa, was projeoted down the steps of the
bar, his shirt ripped off his shoulders and considerably
the worse far wear. Half a dozen R. C. S. men then tried to
retaliate on the Editor. The evening's entertainment was
not terminated by the ever regrettable 10.30 closing time.

On November 9th. theLord Mayor-elect travels through
the City streets i n procession from the Mansion House
to the House of Lords, where he takes the oath of
o f f i c e before the Lord Chancellor and the Judges of
the King's Bench division. This i s the occasion of
the Lord Mayor's: Show - world renowned f o r i t s colour
and gaiety.
In past years i t has been the custom for students
of City and Guilds College to cheer him on his way,
thus ensuring that the chief Magistrate i s on our side
should any differences of opinion arise between us and
the boys i n blue. This year sees bigger stuff. About
t h i r t y members of Guilds' w i l l actually be escorting
him on h i s journey, and the float depicting "UNIFORMS
THROUGH THE AGES" w i l l carry the College crest. The
connection with the City and the City Livery Companies
goes back seventy years, when the City and Guilds of
London Institute founded the Central Technical College
which became the City and Guilds' College. This new
innovation w i l l , we a l l hope, become an annual fixture
to act as a l i v i n g reminder of the t i e s between us
and the City.
