Consteration i n the changing rooms! Inman
and Ansell are going out of training. This i s but
one example of the magnificent keenness exhibited
in the Club to date, We can only attribute i t
to an a l t r u i s t i c desire to encourage the Freshers.
Or i s there a rumour that the old -nen can't take
i t any more?
Whatever the cause, the Club i s certainly
potentially better this year than f o r some year3
past. Our standard irithout the freshers i s
about the same as last year, and ive have some very
good freshers.
The Club t r i a l s at Petersham has certainly
shown t h i s , and there i s more to come. More than
t h i r t y new names were added to the Club's potential
on Freshers' Day. At this rate we should be unbeat-
able i n the University. Why not come along and
join us? You can have a race any Saturday or
I'ednesday, and we t r a i n i n Hyde Park on Tuesday
and Thursday lunch-hours.
GOLFING ASSOCIATION
The average person's conception of a golfer
as being a middle-aged business-man with more
^ioney than sense, i s rapidly becoming out of
d->.te. Golfiug Associations, l i k e the one at
Imperial College, are responsible f o r this
change. They cater f o r beginners, as well as
experienced players. F a c i l i t i e s are p l e n t i f u l due
to the cooperation of Highgate Club. Interested
people should contact D, F. Butters through the
Union l e t t e r rack.
i.C.W.S.C.
Has IOTA any good japospects for this session?
Certainly anybody who vva.lt lo Harlington last Saturday
wouldn't have said so- Seven ICWArians arrived for
Hockey "trials", among them only two freshers. W
e may
lose one of these to the University team. Where are the
other five players.?
There is keen interest in Squash and at least two
freshers have shorn* promise.
Several freshers vent to take part in Netball,

With the influx of about sixty freshers, the Soccer Club
would appear to have a very bright season ahead.
A great deal of enthusiasm was exhibited at the
trials held on Wednesday and Saturday, the results of which
proved most encouraging. Many of the Freshers showed con-
siderable talent, and i t is now obvious that competition
for a place in one of the four elevens will be very keen
this year.
W
e would like to paint out to the Freshers that i t is
extremely difficult for the Club Officials to select the
best talent from two afternoons of trials. Every year there
are many players who start with the lower teams and finish
up playing regularly for the first eleven.
We therefore ask you not to be disappointed i f you feel
that you are playing for a team below your customary stan-
dard in your initial games shortly^ everyone will have his
chance and the important thing is to get a lot of enjoyment
from your football and contribute to the team spirit which
has always been associated with I.C, Soccer.
We wish all our members a happy and successful year.
CANOE CLUB?
There ha* been a certain amount of unofficial discus-
sion in the College concerning the formation of an I.e..
Canoe Club. It appears that many people are willing - nay
eager - to canoe, and are prevented only by lack of capital.
Were a Canoe Club formed at I.C., we hope that there would
be no financial worries.
Besides functioning throughout the session, canoeing
holidays could, be arranged during the vacations. This, of
course, depends largely on the initial success of the Club.
Sea-canoeing, river-canoeing, weekend Youth Hostel
trips- the soope is unlimited.
If anyone i s interested, would they please contact the
Sports Editor,l?elIx. If there is sufficient response,
application will be made to the A.C.C. for permission to
form the Club.

The Rugby Football Club, invited by Vickers
Armstrong, took part i n a seven-a-side tournament
at Weybridge on Sunday October 2nd. A somewhat un-
f i t seven were spurred on bv itch and Tom, and
played good Rugger to reach the f i n a l . By this time
they were on t h e i r knees, and they succombed to the
vigour of a sustained Staines attack.
Imperial's star was Tony Palmer, scoring f i v e
out of the s i x t r i e s by I.C.
After two successful, t r i a l s , this year's Off-
i c i a l s are faced with the usual d i f f i c u l t task of
selecting teams f o r the opening matches on October
15th. Judging by the number of keen freshers on view
the Club can face i t s strong fixture l i s t with con-
fidence, and another good season's Rugger should be
enjoyed by a l l .
