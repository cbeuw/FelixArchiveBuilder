FELIX has,put on his old clothes again. We
just.ain't, got the time or tne energy to dress
him i n his Sunday best; and judging by the t o t a l
absence of c r i t i c i s m i n any l e t t e r to the editor,
we don't think the change w i l l be noticed.
THE INVESTORS RETURN.
Away in the North of Scotland, there occurs a wide flat
river estuary, -an expanse of mud and' water unfrequented by
mart except for the occasional fisherman digging for worms,
and the slime and-rust encrusted pipe that discharges sewage
from the small fishing village on the river- The area is
given over to birds, and, pecking in the mud and sand, you
may see flocks of common gulls, odd curlews, a few black-
backed gulls and oyster-catchers, hordes of noisy terns,-
little gulls "by the score, an occasional heron, and hooded
crows or "corbies" Birds are far from well-mannered, and
life on the estuary is one long fight and scramble for the
beat pickings of the mud- especially the mud around the
business end of the sewage pipe. Here the powerful common
gulls with their vicious-yellow beaks reign supreme. The -
little terns don't stand.a chance, and have to earn, theiar

instant and fierce assault by the. ruling class of common
/ru'lls. This simply confirmed the intelligent tern's opinions
about the greediness of birds, and caused him to recognise
the need for guile in any*progressive movement. Accordingly,
. he flew over the water, dived on a particularly fat frsh,
an&, resisting the impulse to swallow i t , deposited i t at
the feet of one of the gulls* leaders. This'so surprised the •
gull that he quite forgot to peck at the little tern and no
other gull dared to infringe on their leader's right to peck
at an enemy first. And so the1

himself to a dainty morsel from the sewage^ipe until, in a
little whije, he was feeding regularly with the large common
gulls, which just goes to show that even a tern will won",
