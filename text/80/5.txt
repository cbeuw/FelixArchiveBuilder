The Editor, I.C. Union,
FELIX. 22.9.55.
Dear S i r ,
Are we a l l brown baggers, boozers, or
bellowers; don't any of us think ? As f a r as I
know, there has been no group of philosophers i n
the College f o r years. I can not believe that
there i s no interest.
Philosophy i s the art of thinking about
the indemonstrable. What i s consciousness, free
w i l l , right and wrong, and God, i f these exist ?
What i s the world we think we observe; does that
exist ? These are not e n t i r e l y irrelevent ques-
tions; the answers to some of them have formed
ihe basis of Communism, Capitalism, and Chris-
t i a n i t y . If we are interested i n these, we should
be interested i n their roots too.
As a s t a r t , I am trying to run an inform-
a l open group meeting on Tuesday evenings; finan-
c i a l l y i t w i l l be under the S.C.H.. Gordon P h i l -
l i o s , win has studied philosophy, has agreed to
come and talk about the thinking of some of the
great philosophers, past and present. We should
then be able to talk u n t i l midnight.
T should have l i k e d to have c a l l e d i t
"The I.C. Coffee House", but how do we get coffee
i n Committee Room "A" at 6.00 ? Any suggestions ?
Yours etc.,
ROBERT B. PALMER.

'The Union Library Committee wishes to
draw the attention of students to changes i n the
organisation of the Library. Many books have been
stolen i n recent years; last year over eighty,
and i t has been decided that the Library can now
remain open only when a l i b r a r i a n i s present.
A member of the Committee i s on duty
daily from 1 - 2 p.m., and Miss Bamford of the
City and Guilds Library from 2 - 5 p.m.. At
other times i t w i l l be locked, although books may
be returned to Mr. James, the C t 0 Librarian.
Freshers may care to note that the Un-
ion Library, which costs them nothing to j o i n ,
i s i n an annexe of the Guilds Library, which i s
d i r e c t l y above Ayrton Hall Refectory. The l i b r a r y
is well stocked with readable books, which we
w i l l be very pleased to lend them.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

To the Editor,
Dear S i r ,
Owing to the paucity of your present l i t e r -
ary talent we f e e l bound to make a f i r s t contribut-
ion immediately:
F i r s t , we would tender our heartfelt,
thanks f o r the profuse words of welcome by Maoavity
(FELIX p.4). Already we feel much less l i k e "out-
casts" and would be more than pleased to direct any
person to the nearest — — — . We f e e l that the
i n i t i a l expenditure on FELIX was well j u s t i f i e d and
are each now the proud owners, of two copies.
Four Resident FRESH WOMEN.
Dear Sir,
On reading the excellent "Scrapbook for 1954" in
last week's FELIX, I was struck by the absence of any refer-
ence to music in Imperial College. Mr. Macavity 3hould have
known better (however did you think up that name John?).
Music in I.C. really i s a going concern, and this year we
have got off to a fine start with both Choir and Orchestra,
each under their new conductors.
At the first Choir practice this term close on 90
people were pr«««nt, and we were able to give Broken Hoist
great encouragement at the outset of her ne». , m as Choir
conductor. She will have to work us hard so that suitable
music oan be given in the Albert Hall on Conmeau Day.
At present we have more female singers than male
so we require more male members from I.C., espeoially
tenors. Gentlemen, in case you still--hang back, think of the
excellent opportunity thus provided for social oontaot
amongst the fifty young ladies who Make up our sopranos
and altos.
Choir practices are held at 5-30 p.m. on Tuesdays
in the Council Room, C.&G.
Yours faithfully,
John Seeley

V I E W P O I N T
Many readers will agree that the undergraduate should
attend at least one Commeroration Ball during his Colleae
pareer. The Ball i s put on by our own Onion Entertain-
ments Committee, and apart from the faot that numbers must
Obviously be limited to suit the spaoe available, i t should
be within the financial reach of the average I.C. under-
graduate (if such a person can be envisaged). But i s i t 1
A eonservative estimate of tee total cost cannot be less
than five pounds.
This estimate does not inolude the cost of hiring
evening dress i f one has not got i t . Ten shillings
estimated for transport is not generous. Most evening
gowns cannot be dragged around through the filth of the
London Boaas and lubes and a taxi is required.
On the slender grants and heavily-taxed father's poo-
ket, how many of us can really afford this extravagance ?
At the moment the numbers are limited by the price, and the
same type of parson goes every year. Would, i t not be
better i f our Entertainments Committee stepped down from
their pedestal of the Dorohester and held the dance in a
less expensive, but never-the-less suitable place, say
Kensington Town Hall ? Also, sinoe the event is of value
to the Union, the Committee.=might purposely run i t at a
loss. Alternatively, i f the Dorohester is prefered as
a plaoe more suitable for the occasion, the prioe of the
tioketa might be subsidised- by the Union so that they
would oost a guinea, and the numbers might then be lim-
ited by toe tioket distribution.
Obviously, the arrangements for this year's Ball will
have to be accepted as they stand and the extra inconven-
ienoe of holding the funotion on a Wednesday will have to
be endured. It is to be hoped that those who go will enjoy
themselves very much. Next year perhaps some of tthose
who would have liked to have gone this year will be able
to afford a oheaper, but not an unoheapened. Commemoration.
