Welcome to the new, all-improved
students' newspaper! This particular
brand washes whiter and digs deeper,
so if you thought last year's anonymous
letters were shocking, then 'you ain't
seen nothing yet'. We've kept the old
reliable formula but added some sparkle.
This 'Postgraduate Issue' is only a hint
of things to come. The next issue will
appear on Monday 5th October.
How can you help?
From speaking to various people
around College, it is clear that our idea
of a good FELIX doesn't always tie in
with most students' idea of what the
newspaper should contain. It's very easy
to stick to the usual formula if nobody
complains about it. If you want to see
something in FELIX that isn't here, then
please write and tell us about it. It's very
easy to get isolated in our little basement
and we're not mind readers.
Science
One addition has been a new science
page. We are looking for a postgraduate
or member of staff to act as Science
Editor. The job involves writing and
collating various scientific news items
each week. If you are at all interested
then either telephone me today on int
3515 or visit our offices anytime during
September.
Censorship
In the light of the Handbook episode
(page 5) it is time for Publications Board
to reexamine the editor's role on our
external pubhcations. Was Pippa Salmon
elected to collate information and
produce the guide, with the Union
Executive deciding on the tone of
articles, or was she elected to edit a fair
and representative handbook? Perhaps
the Executive wish to change her title
to Handbook Manager? The publication
would lose its credibility if it allowed
itself to become a pure advertisement for
the Union. There is no point in extolling
the virtues of the Union Bar and oimtting
all the faults. Freshers will soon realise
that the articles are biased toward the
Union facilities and consequently will
arrive at College with the opinion that
the Union is only interested in putting
forward its corporate view point. This
makes the Union just as bad as College
with the rosy picture it paints in its
prospectus.
I hope that Publications Board makes
some policy for once and defends the
editorial freedom which we value so
highly in FELIX.
Finance Fiasco
The rumours are rife within Sherfield
as to who will lose their job after the
latestfinancialcock-up. Perhaps College
will finally see sense and completely
shake up the Finance Section before we
follow the same path as University
College, Cardiff.
And finally
The Office will be closed from
tomorrow for three weeks.
