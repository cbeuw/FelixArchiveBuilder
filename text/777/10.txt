Seniors squash tournament
The idea of this multi-department squash
tournament arose after a number of
interdepartmental squash friendlies had
received an enthusiastic response from
all the parties involved.
The tournament took place in three
rounds, each round consisting of four
matches between the two teams.
The Captains had assigned a ranking
of one (good) to four (poor) to each
member of their team. Players of equal
rank were matched in play against each
other, each match being the best of three
games. The winning team would have
to show depth in its ability to produce
consistently good squash play because
each player was restricted to playing in
a maximum of two matches with a trial
of twelve matches having to be played.
At the start of the first round the
Department of Materials looked
formidable with three class players
leading their line up. Their strength at
the top was confirmed when Sheppard
and Sweeney easily held their matches
against Bashir and Ross respectively.
However, Chem Eng looked like
drawing the round when Dr D Stuckey
won his match and Vadley was leading
one game to love in hers, but Stokes
fought back to take the match two games
to one to pick up a vital two victory
points for Materials.
There was less excitement in the other
half of the first round where Maths
decisively beat Mech Eng to pick up two
victory points as well.
By the second round, the atmosphere
on the courts had become tense. The
match between Ross and Downie had to
be declared void when Ross had his
eyebrow slashed by his opponents racket
in the heat of play. Chem Eng eventually
had a comfortable win over Maths by
two matches to one.
There was tremendous excitement in
the match between Prof Sheppard and
Mike Carling. Sheppard tried to unnerve
his opponent through his aggressive
appealing for let calls from the referee,
but excellent umpiring from I Mcintosh
averted disaster and kept play in
progress. The Dept of Materials were
not able to maintain the pressure in the
matches lower down in the order and
could only pick up a draw round against
Mech Eng.
This left the tournament finely poised
in thefinalround with Materials leading
with three victory points, closely
followed by Chem Eng and Maths on
two. With the adrenalin in full flow,
Chem Eng easily saw off Mech Eng by
beating them in all four matches to notch
up another two victory points. This was
not good enough to stop Materials from
winning the tournament by a clear
victory point, when Maths could only
win one of their four matches against
them.
The player of the tournament award
must go to Prof Terry Sheppard and his
capacity to charge around the court, his
pure agression during play and that look
of agony on his face"when his appeals
for let calls were turned down, made the
tournament a memorable occasion.
Since, this trial tournament was a
resounding success, the introduction of
an inaugral Imperial College Seniors
Departmental Squash Tournament next
year is a certainty. It is hoped that a
trophy worthy of such a major college
sporting event can be purchased and be
on display in the Union Office before
the heats start in the Autumn term to
decide the qualifiers for the finals. I hope
that those who become involved will be
proud tofightfor their departments to
get a place in the July 1988 finals.
The postgraduates and senior
members of this College need an event
like this squash tournament to make life
more interesting at Imperial. I hope that
a large number of departments will be
submitting teams as soon as details of
the tournament and heats have been
publicised. If you are interested in
organising the squash team within your
department and can get a team of at least
six postgraduates/postdoctorates/
technicians/staff together, then contact
Yishu Nanda (Chem Eng PG) on int

tournament 87-88.

COMPETITION
Sense
Sense, the National Deaf-Blind and
Rebella Association, is running a
competition for entrants to design a
household object for a deaf-blind person.
Winning entries from the competition
will form the focus of a special
exhibition entitled Designing for the
Deaf Blind which will take place in
November this year.
The competition is open to all students
in full-time further education during the
whole or part of 1987. Entrants are
asked to envisage the difficulties
encountered by a person without normal
sight and hearing whilst performing the
everyday activities most of us take for
granted. They are then invited to submit
a design for an item which will enhance
some aspect of home living for a deaf-
blind person. Closing date is 19th
October 1987.
All prizes for the competition have
been donated. First prize is £100 worth
of artists equipment to be selected by the
winner. Second prize is £50 worth of
Penguin Books to be selected by the
winner and the third prize is a Filofax.
Winning entries and a selection of
commended entries will be exhibited at
the Hulton Sculpture Gallery, Royal
Society of British Sculptors, 108 Old
Brompton Road, London, from 23rd to
27fh November 1987. The Hulton
Sculpture Gallery was founded in 1986
as a centre for blind and partially sighted
sculptors.
