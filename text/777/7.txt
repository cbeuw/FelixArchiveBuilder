LIVE Billy Joel
B I L L Y Joel possesses the rare quality
of being a songwriter who can sing in
an age of singers who can write songs.
It is this that has led him to enjoy
longevity in the music business and
attain such a wide range of appeal
Joel first toured Britain in 1973 after
the success of his third album Piano
Man. Fourteen years later this July, he
returned to Wembley to give new
generations a taste of his many
memorable songs.
The Bridge Tour set featured
surprisingly little of his most recent
material. Not more than fifteen minutes
from two hours were lent to promoting
his latest album. Instead he treated us
to songs like Uptown Girl, Pressure and
Scenes from an Italian Restaurant.
My only disappointment was that he
had to have another singer reach his high
notes in the earlier songs he performed.
Despite this and the high ticket prices
(£15) I would still encourage you to see
his excellent live performance when he
next tours Great Britain. CM.
RECORDS
Skin Games—Cowboy Joe
Lone Justice Wannabees with this
week's best of a bad lot. Backing very
reminiscent of Bad County and lead
vocalist (Wendy) who can sing. Just one
reservation; Skin Games is rather an odd
name for a band, but give them a listen
anyway.
The Cult-Wild Flower
I've yet to find anyone who thinks this
isn't Billy Idol. Nuff said.
Michael Jackson—
/ Just Can't Stop Loving You
Starts with ultra-naff spoken intro (you
look so beautiful tonight etc) moving on
to a very ordinary duet with Siedah
Corrett (who?). Following Thriller was
always going to be difficult; if the new
album's success means as much to CBS
records as some recent press reports
indicate, I would sell my shares now...
Paul King—Follow My Heart
At last, something good and somebody
who can sing. Buy it, and CBS might
not be in so much trouble after all.

THE PROMS
UPON mention of the Proms, everyone
immediately thinks of the Last Night,
one of the Great British pageants of flag
waving, celebration and general
pageantry watched by millions all across
the world. But in many ways this overly
nationalistic and perhaps xenophobic
festival is totally atypical of the sixty-
six concerts that make up the season.
The index of works in the Proms
Guide resembles a classical A - Z with
music from Alain to Zemlinsky passing
such well known composers as
Beethoven, Handel and Prokofiev as
well as a number who are less well
known.
Any one concert is a mix of the
obscure with the classic, introducing
new music with your old favourites.
This year the theme of the Proms is
Dance with fifty-three of the concerts
having at least one piece of music to do
with dance, including a number of BBC
commissions receiving their world
premiere.
Tickets can be purchased on the door
for £1.50 or £2.00. The more expensive
tickets are for the arena, more
commonly associated with the
Promenade Concerts but this area suffers
from overcrowding and you need to be
over six feet tall to be able to see
anything properly unless you are early
enough to get near the front. The
cheaper price gains you access to the
highest level of the Albeit Hall where
there are dubious acoustics, but usually
plenty of floor space to sit on and a full
view of the orchestra.
Tonight's prom is by the BBC Welsh
Symphony Orchestra who are
performing excerpts from Glazunov's
Roymonda suite, the Violin Concerto in
D major by Brahms and Dvorak's
Symphony No. 9 in E minor 'From the
New World'. For details of other
concerts, the Haldane Library has a copy
of the prospectus, or you can buy your
own for £1.50 from good newsagents.
If you intend going to more than just a
few it's a good investment since
programmes at each concert cost 30p to
promenaders and contain little extra
information.
Everyone should experience the Last
Night at least once. This year's is on
September 12th and the same £1.50 and
£2.00 tickets will be available on the
door. However, to qualify you must
have similarly-priced ticket stubs from
at least five other proms and be fairly
near the front of the queue, which means
queueing much of the day (and previous
night). A.B.

M A U S is no ordinary cartoon book. It
tells the tale of Nazi Germany where
Nazis are cats and Jews are mice. It is
the true story of a Jewish survivor but,
perhaps more than that, it shows how
the author is trying to come to terms with
his father's history and his life with a
Jewish survivor.
There are two stories within the
beautifully drawn cartoons. The first is
the father's story of countless brushes
with death and the terror of betrayal.
The second reveals Art Spiegelman's
tortured relationship with his father as
they try to lead a normal life after the
war.
It's a remarkable work of love
combining novel, documentary, memoir
md comic book. To be published by
Penguin on 10th September at £5.95.
