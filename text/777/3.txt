Success and misery

Beers all
round
IMPERIAL College's beer supplies are
to be controlled centrally by the Union,
following discussions between the
Refectories Manager, Holland Club
Manager and ICU Deputy President.
The idea of a combined beer order was
suggested last year by Rob Northey, the
Refectories Manager. Both the College
and the Union stand to make substantial
savings from the increased barrellage
discount and if St Mary's Medical
School choose to join the new system,
the order will be the largest in London.
The National Student Services
Organisation (NSSO) provides similar
discounts to its members, but Imperial's
non-affiliation to the N U S has
disqualified it from joining the scheme.
This could also prevent IC from taking
part in the proposed U L U central
supplying venture.
ICU Deputy President Alan Rose
commented that he was "not looking to
set up a consortium of London
colleges."
Expedition Off
T H E M O U N T A I N E E R I N G Club's
Karakoram expedition has been called
off due to illness. Some members of the
team had already arrived at Karachi and
were making final preparations for the
ascent, when one of them became ill and
had to be flown back to Britain.
Expedition leader lerry Hasnip decided
to cancel the rest of the trip.
The Scout and Guide East Karakoram
Expedition is going ahead as planned.

THE N E W Science Park at Silwood is
nearing completion. The Park, which
has been under construction for the past
year, is a joint venture between Investors
In Industry (3i) and Imperial College.
The park incorporates a Technology
Transfer Centre, owned by College, and
70% of the lettable space in this has
already been snapped up. One of the
main aims of the Centre is to attract
members of College engaged in the
commercialisation of their research.
Disco fiasco
SOUTHSIDE Bar's disco was closed by
Sherfield messengers on the last day of
term. The IC Radio disco had continued
past its usual ending time of 11.15pm,
as people were celebrating the end of the
Life Sciences exams. At a quarter to
twelve the Sherfield messengers arrived
and, explaining that College Secretary
lohn Smith had asked for the disco to
end, began to remove people from the
building. Students complained that
violence was used in the process but no
proceedings are to be taken.
T E N students who had been allocated
College accommodation this Summer
were given only three days notice that
their bookings had been cancelled. The
problem was caused by overbooking of
rooms in the Summer Accommodation
Centre. The students were not on
academic courses and six of them were
subsequently offered alternative
accommodation. De-allocation was
necessary to accommodate postgraduates
BOAT Club's 1st IV has won the
prestigious Henley Regatta Challenge
Cup, beating top university and college
teams and cutting six seconds from the
course record in the process.
Since the Club's Henley success,
several members have been selected to
represent the Britain in international
competitions, including the World
Student Games and the World
Championships. Nicholas Burfitt, who
was selected for the World
Championships, also has hopes of
rowing in next year's Olympic Games.
The controversy over the funding for
Boat Club's new eight continues, with
who were guaranteed one year in hall.
Most rooms had to be vacated by
10am on Saturday 27th lune so that
conference guests could move in on the
following Monday. This was to allow
time for the rooms to be thoroughly
cleaned. In the past the quitting rule has
not been strictly enforced and students
have been allowed to move out at any
time during the weekend. Residents
were upset at the short notice they were
£4,500 still to be paid. The Queensgate
Trust (an organisation which provides
money for non academic activities) has
agreed to meet half of the £9,000 bill
which was temporarily paid by the
College's Activities Loan Scheme.
The remaining money was to be
obtained from the Union by rearranging
Boat Club's Five Year Plan, but the
Club did not apply for the release of the
money until after the boat had been
bought, breaking Union Finance rules.
The matter will be discussed further at
the next meeting of the Union Finance
Committee.
given and the Union organised a 'Crash
Pad'. Although no one used the crash
pad, several students had to stay with
friends.
Some students had very little notice
that their application for Summer
residence had been turned down. The
notices were sent out over a week before
the end of term but many only arrived
three days before the students were due
to leave. At the end of term, some
students were still to receive their letters.
The problem was made worse by the
letters being sent to departments after
exams had finished, when students were
not checking their mail.
One student called the weekend as a
"ginormous farce". He described
students who got up at six o'clock to
pack and parents who drove from two
o'clock in the morning in order to beat
the deadline. Southside looked like a
refugee camp, he added.
After rumours that College Assistant
Secretary Michael Arthur had made the
decision that students had to leave on
Saturday, anonymous notices appeared
around Southside. The notices claimed
that accommodation was available and
gave what was in fact Mr Arthur's home
number. He later stated that the rumours
were "not in the slightest bit true" and
said that he had received "one or two"
calls. It was reported that his phone was
off the hook all weekend.
