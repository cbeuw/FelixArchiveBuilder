Finance blunder
drags IC further
into debt
A N INVESTIGATION by the Inland Revenue could cost IC more than
£100,000 in unpaid tax. The problem has arisen because of the
Refectories Section's failiure to pay tax and National Insurance for
casual workers. It is likely that the cost will have to be covered by
price increases in refectories and bars.
The College is claiming that the Revenue does not accept this claim,
workers are self-employed and are • College may have to pay Up to seven

and National Insurance. If the Inland Although Refectories will be the
hardest hit, other parts of the College,
including the Union Bar, are also under
scrutiny. This is not expected to reveal
any major problems, since they keep
better records of casual labour. The
Holland Club may be also investigated.
A spokesman from the Finance
Section said that there had been efforts
to reform the system and that people
who undertook a lot of casual work were
put onto the payroll. He admitted that
the investigation had taken the College
by surprise and that it was causing the
administration some concern.
If the College is faced with a large bill,
it may consider suing the auditors, who
have passed the College accounts every
year.
The Special Office of the Inland
Revenue carried out a check of the
College's books about two years ago, as
part of a general investigation into
university finance. The check did not
result in any further action against the
College. The current investigation is
being undertaken by the Inland
Revenue's local office and was
prompted by a DHSS check on part time
College workers who were also claiming
the dole.
