Lord Grade, cigar smoking supremo
and the TV moguls TV mogul, once
had a dream. It was at the time that
Jesus of Nazareth had been made,
and Lew was trying to sell it to the
American networks. One night he
had a vision seeing a large '25'. This,
he thought, must be the price of the
film. Can't be 25 or 25,000, so it
must be 25,000,000. He duly got $25
million, twice what they were initial-
ly prepared to pay for it. I also had a
dream in which a large '18'
appeared. This means nothing, I
thought, besides an indication that I
must be working too hard. Days
later, while wandering through the
SCR, as you do, all be came clear. As
you know, dear reader, my hearing is
phenomenally good, so I couldn't
help but overhear a conversation
about '18'. As with Lord Grade, it
meant 18 million. It's the Sherfield
budget for 1996/97.
As you can imagine my ears pricked
up considerably at this stage. I caught
the word 'Estates', this time from
another part of the SCR. My head
turned. Apparently, they expect to
spend about £8 million in the coming
year. Fair enough. Big department,
lot of expenses, but also with a lot of
income from the Halls of Residence.
A lot indeed, about £695,000 from
April to September or minus
£215,000 after expenses, according
to my indiscreet fellow diners. Still,
never mind, the planned expansion of
conferencing will bring in the drach-
mas. Oh dear. It's the students that
bankroll Estates, not conferencing
which is a loss-maker, due to the
already slapdash control of costs
going for a Burton as IC kindly offer
to employ every stu- C i yy-i f\ y\

They also men
tioned that Clayponds \

more on gardening
than security con- V o l C C O f
tracts, which I'm
sure will delight the residents.
Walking by the B M S , someone
shouted over the noise of concrete
mixers that the communal areas,
which were cut from 800 to 600 sq m
have been further 'redesigned' to
consist of a coffee machine, possibly
on the fourth floor. You seem upset,
doctor?
I think I then heard Finance's name
mentioned. I can't be certain, but I'm
sure someone said £2.3 million. That
R n l / a r seems rather a lot of
money spent for a
department that is
supposed to be careful
th the cash, I
hought. Still, it's a
ig university, lot

etc. Hmm.

but this looks a tad

s s i v e . Perhaps
Nottingham con-
tract work out and if so, why don't
we, since I doubt it could cost more
than the current setup. Some careless
soul on another table remarked that
to ensure that proper checks are kept
on spending, we spend nearly
f
f just
£150,000 on internal audits. So rigor-
ous are these checks, my own depart-
ment has taken to cleaning the inside
of windows that haven't had their
outside cleaned for 30 years and fer-
rying students up to St Mary's in
taxis so the poor dears can attend lec-
tures scheduled with no consultation
between the two. God help us if we
didn't have an audit.
Registry's getting £2 million said
someone on the walkway who
should have known better. This
seems rather excessive for a depart-
ment that issues certificates and
exam timetables. It's not short of
staff, as I have said before, but for
that to explain a budget of more than
a couple of hundred thousand, they
would need more people than could
physically squeeze onto level 3.1 just
can't think where all that money
goes- answers on a postcard.
In short, you learn a lot from pinning
back the ears round here. It's all very
well College constantly pleading
poverty, but when details like this
come to the fore, it is very difficult to
have any sympathy. Academic
departments are having to make gen-
uine cuts, but Sherfield ploughs its
merry furrow, stuck in the 1970s,
oblivious to the real world. IC has an
excellent Management School and a
central management unaware of its
teachings - Discuss.
Westminster Eye - Hamish Common
A programme depicting sexual abuse
was broadcast on ITV this week. "No
Child of Mine" - commissioned by
Meridian Broadcasting - depicting
the gradual fall of a kind but weak
man into a pimp and abuser, with the
ghouls of our nightmares reconciled
with the family next door. Comments
were mainly along the usual lines,
that such things ought not to be
shown on our screens.
One may ask: who makes these
comments? Who is kindly deciding
what the public ought and ought not
to watch? Mainly it is journalists and
backbench MPs, plus occasionally
councillors and various pressure
groups. These groups of people cer-
tainly don't spring out at me a being
representative of the public as a
whole: in fact each job requires
someone with a big mouth and a will-
ingness to use it.
A perfect example of this is
Westminster City Council's decision
a few months ago to ban JG Ballard's
'Crash', a film depicting fantasies
about car crash victims, from screens
within its area. The British Board for
Film Classification had already given
it an 18 Certificate, but Westminster
used its legal right to ban it anyway,
preventing a large number of West
End cinemas from showing it. I can
be more precise about who made this
decision - it was a bunch of council-
lors, most of whom admitted not hav-
ing seen the film ("but that is not the
point" said one councillor) and were
taking a wonderful opportunity to get
themselves onto news programmes
and newspaper pages with long
tirades against the tide of filth and
their brave defence of decency.
When listening to their speeches, I
couldn't help be reminded of how
similar it sounded to dictatorial gov-
ernments defending their right to
censor news reports and opposing
views. Both arguments stated that the
State had to act for the common good
in defiance of certain members of the
public. Of course the good council-
lors aren't despots, but their censor-
ing of a film that they hadn't seen,
based on their own opinions, which
were not in the least representative of
the public's is dangerous and bad.
It is perfectly possible for a film to
be shown only on cinema, or for
more cuts to be made in a video ver-
sion of a particular film. Natural
Born Killers, a film of similar ill-
repute, was shown on cinema, with
cuts, and its release on video has
been suspended indefinitely. The
BBFC is publicly accountable for its
actions, and this is the best compro-
mise we can have between decency
and undue censorship.
The media are another part of the
problem: they are always willing to
exaggerate and fan the flames when
something comes out on television.
In nearly every report on such pro-
grammes, you will find a quote by
Mary Whitehouse. All they have
really done is phoned her up, saying
there's a new revolting programme
out and what does she think about it?
Their tendency to give column inch-
es to the people mentioned above just
biases the argument and creates a
bigger news story out it, since plenty
of people are always ready to jump
on the bandwagon and publicise
themselves before an election.
In any democracy freedom of
choice of the individual is of para-
mount importance, with the authori-
ties giving adults suitable guidance
and allowing them to see what they
wish. Britain has some of the strictest
codes on television and video ratings,
and they are unlikely to change given
the influence of the censorship lobby
on these issues.
Councils should be wary of using
powers of censorship - the opinions
of a whinging few should not be
assumed to be those of the public at
large.
