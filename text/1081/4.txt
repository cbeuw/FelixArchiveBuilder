Tower cranes and scaffold mask the BMS site, but
underneath, the building begins to take shape
NEWSTEAM
Despite difficulties with the winter
frosts, the Bio-medical Sciences
building will be on schedule for it's
internal fit out to start in June confi-
dently predicts Schal Construction
Manager, Phil Hilton. Fears that the
work wouldn't meet the strict timing
targets have been assuaged by rejig-
ging of the work.
From the Queen's Lawn, the Bio-
medical Science building is a cluster
of concrete pillars and steel poles.
Behind the scaffold facade, the site's
170 workers are currently laying the
steel supports for the final two stories
and completing the internal walls on
the lower levels. Concrete laying was
hindered by the weather and has sub-
sequently overrun its schedule.
The next stage, the steel super-
structure for the top two floors, has
had to start without the concrete
being finished. This, as explained by
Schal's Site Manager Oliver Clarke,
has necessitated the use of a third
tower crane, making the BMS build-
ing "the biggest construction project
in the capital." The extra crane,

which is sited within a service duct,
will be removed after the steel work
is complete.
Even without the internal walls,
the impressive size of the future lab-
oratories, seminar rooms and lecture
theatres can already be gauged. Mr
Hilton described the project as "chal-
lenging" with some unique features,
particularly the central duct shaft
which was "the biggest he had ever
seen," and the central atrium that is
designed to bring light into the centre
of the block. The atrium, which will
have a clear roof, will have a glass
divider between the first and second
floors to prevent noise rising from the
public lower floors to the research
levels above. Reading and writing-up
areas will be set aside adjoining the
atrium, with communal 'social areas'
on the northside of the building over-
looking the Queen's Lawn. The
ICSM Student's Union has been allo-
cated space on the ground floor.
The library extension and the
music and arts centre, the source of
much acrimony in recent weeks
(Letters, Felix 1079), is proceeding at
a steady rate, with weather sealing on
the fourth floor almost complete.
John Downey, Schal's Library Site
Manager, said that "noisy work had
been restricted to between 10am and
2pm" to minimise the disturbance to
staff and students.
Contrary to reports in IC Reporter
that the music and arts centre's fund-
ing bid for Lottery funding had
failed, Ian Caldwell, Director of
Estates, said that the application was
being currently being put together for
submission at the end of March.
