Are Imperial College students
This sound-
The differences between the various
Halls of Residence of Imperial
College were recently brought to my
attention. A resident of Fisher Hall
commented to me that on a recent
visit to Holbein Hall he had been
amazed at the difference between the
standards of repair. He gushed on
about the mirrors, the pastel shaded
walls and the up-lighting, then said:
"God, they must be paying a fortune.'
ed like a challenge to me, so after a bit of wran-
gling I managed to get hold of all the rents for the
halls (see table below).
Like me you'll probably have noticed that
Holbein and Fisher Halls have the same prices, as
do the halls in Prince's Gardens. But why should
this be so? Why is Garden Hall cheaper than the
rest of Prince's Gardens? Time for a quick call to
the Accommodation Office. Sadly this was not too
useful. Sharine Brown, the Residences Manager
gave the new prices for halls next year. Those cost-
ing £47.53 are going up to £49.00 and the halls
costing £58.31 will go up to £60.06, except Fisher
which has been reduced to £53.13, but apart from
that, nothing, nada, zip, zilch.
I was referred to Piers Williams on the grounds
that she didn't "know enough about (the subject)"
and "only wanted to deal with facts". Piers
explained that this year the accommodation levels
were being set by himself and the Union
Accommodation Officer. They had
duly traipsed round all the halls and
set the levels accordingly.
Fisher Hall was apparently refur-
bished 7 years ago and Holbein, 3.
These cosmetic renovations have jus-
tified an increase in rent. Speaking as
someone who didn't get a choice into
which hall I went into, I find it a lit-
tle unfair that. Why should I be
forced to pay £10 pw more than other
residents in Evelyn Gardens for no
noticeable difference? The rooms are
generally accepted to be smaller and,
to quote a visiting friend, "crap".
Frankly speaking, the whole building
is in a state of disrepair. I cannot
actually recall having seen a wall
with paint not discoloured and peel-
ing off.
If Fisher is better than Southwell
and Willis Jackson then I don't mind
paying more but I R E A L L Y object to
paying as much as Prince's Gardens.
What does Evelyn Gardens have
compared to Southside? A shop? A
Pizza place? A student bar?
Proximity to college? Connections to
the college Computer network? No.
The only link to College is the single
telephone line up to the main cam-
pus, but since the internal phones
don't work with the A C C discount
phone cards it is of no use.
Suitably riled, my partner and I
Simon Wistow and his cohorts of
mackintosh-clad investigators
turn their skills to Imperial's
housing problem...

'acquired' a copy of the Confidential
Strategy for the Future Development
and Management of Student
Residences. We began to skim read
through it looking for juicy titbits to
highlight
Interestingly enough, the Powers
that be seem to be aware of the prob-
lems, concerning Imperial's bedstock,
as well they should. To quote the
report, Imperial College is aware that the rents are
high "relative to competitors, both London based
and provincial". They also accept that IC halls
offer "questionable value for money in certain res-
idences where there is a severe maintenance back-
log."
Back in 1993, however, an exhaustive plan to
"overcome perceived competitive weaknesses in
the physical condition of the residences and exces-
sive variations in standards of maintenance
between residences and increase value for money"
was drawn up.
This resolved to "establish minimum acceptable
and targeted standards for all student accommoda-
tion in terms of furnishings, equipment, decorative
order, cleanliness and all round value for money,
and ensure that all existing residence meet the min-
imum standard by the end of 1993/4 and targeted
standards by 1995/6". Included in this is a "rolling
programme of redecoration - three year internal
cycle, five years external". Hmm, has this hap-
pened? First impressions say not.
On a more serious note, Fisher Hall
(together with other halls in Evelyn
Gardens) is under Leasehold for the
next 50 years. Although the report
resolved to begin negotiation with the
relevant landlord for outright pur-
chase, the report also highlights the
College's relative lack of funds and
inability to raise finance at acceptable
rates. This may explain the discrepan-
cy between the 'three year plan' and
reality. Worryingly, they seem to be
overly concerned that the poor condi-
tion of halls reduces their chances of
"profitable disposal". In other words,
they seem to give priority to getting
halls in a condition fit to sell, rather
than fit to live in. Furthermore, sec-
tions discussing the possibility of halls
being forced to close if they could not
meet Health and Safety standards (and
forming suitable contingency plans)
does nothing to inspire confidence in
housing standards.
Through further acquisitive activi-
ties, we found ourselves in possession
of the NUS Accommodation Costs
Survey 1996/97, which covers private
sector and university rents at all uni-
versities in the UK. The main findings
were as follows:
•The average weekly costs across all
types of institutional accommodation
in 1996/97 was £48.37.

paying too much for their rent?

The inviting interior of Fisher Hall's showers. Students share their daily ablutions with flakes of
paint, mould and mushrooms.
•The average weekly rent for private accommoda-
tion in 1996/97 was £40.12.
•The average cost of institutional accommodation
increased by 4.7% between 1995/96 and 1996/97
(actually Imperial only increased by 2.6%, hurrah).
•Average, non-institutional rents increased by
3.8% between 1995/96 and 1996/97.
•A student living in institutional accommodation in
receipt of a full grant and student loan did, on aver-
age, spend 63% of their weekly income on rent.
•A student living in the private rented sector did,
on average spend 52% of his her weekly income on
rent.
My conclusion is mixed. Imperial College is
aware of the problems they face with their bed-
stock. Union input into accommodation charges
may help matters. Given the exclusivity (read cost)
of our Kensington location and the crippling lack
of funds, things could be worse. On a more subjec-
tive note, however, there is a need to address the
imbalance of rents charged within Imperial's halls.
Perhaps some money should be spent on the resi-
dences that need sprucing up. After all, happy halls
= happy students = happy uni!
