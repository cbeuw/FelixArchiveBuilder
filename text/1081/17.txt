From Felix's sports pundit Dave Robinson.
Most of the teams involved in the
Formula 1 World Championship
must having been wetting them-
selves with expectation. The
Williams team which had complete-
ly dominated the 1996 season was in
turmoil. With Frank Williams,
Patrick Head (Technical Director)
and Adrian Newey (Designer) on a
charge of the manslaughter of
Ayrton Senna, the team were due to
be distracted from the track. Added
to this Adrian Newey began legal
processes to extract himself from his
contract to join
Mclarcn. at I the
marriage th- -mil'
threatened ; .ir supply
World Ch;> I ill.
Then a few weeks ago in
William's new car, Jacques
Villeneuvedrove within one tenth of
times set h. • n tcst-
ing for a week. Williams with a new
agreement with Renault began to
look invincible ,:s die new p;irtn i
ship of Villencuve and Frcntzcn
began to set blistering times for the
rest of the week. More surprises
Schumacher! he most sub-
stantial challenge to Villeneuve,
however both t f l B p e n " : i n
and his
team mate Edcfie Irvine have strug-
gled desperately to keep up with
Coulthard's silver Mclaren and
Berger's new Benetton.
Usually the remaining teams have
a set order with Jordan and Ligicr
making up the remaining places on
the grid followed by a number of
teams that never score any points.
For the first time in years a thrilling
season promises when the competi-
tion stretches beyond the top two
teams. Damon Hill is determined to
remain competitive, and Olivier
Panis could yet win more races in an
improved Ligier owned by Alain
Prost. There are also a couple of new
boys, Jackie Stewart's new tartan
team with Rubens Barrichello still
remain an unknown quantity but are
likely to provide a few surprises.
Somethings however will not
change, just as the marshals thought
the gravel traps were looking tops,
Pedro Diniz and Ukyo Katayama in
nice new cars will still be there
destroy all that raking and write off a
a couple of hundred thousand
pounds worth of car each race.
In the floodlit one day series down
under, England and New Zealand are
doing something strange. The crick-
et played is exciting crowds to
Bs proportions. The stadiums
a£ fans who are being enter-
I and the players seem to enjoy
: more, I'm not suggesting
in favour of one -
Jays, bin given Ihe empty stadiums
and lack of interest in last summer's
efforts, something has to improve
Surely an evening game at a floodlit
Lord's with flashy kits and signature
tunes would bring in the crowds
against the Aussies. They could
even Play the national anthems and
televise It to whip up a hit of nation-
alism.

quickly, there were ran outs, dropped

ets tumbled Cork and Gough were
left with two to score from the final
ball, Gough missed with his attempt
to put the ball into orbit but Cork was
sprinting down the wicket only
slightly slower than the ball and got
the single to earn a draw. If England
continue to perform then the second
half of the winter will have been a
commercial success, what remains to
be seen is if this can be carried onto
the pitch as Atherton attempts to take
the Ashes for the first time I remem-
ber.
RSM hockey babes score
We've scored a goal (courtesy of
Sarah). Finally. About bloody time.
And they were second division and
we're only third.
With the determined defending
from Piv, the endless effort from
Alex and Ros, the strong reliability
of Squid and Estella, the astounding
vocal support from Emma (she's
pretty good in goal too), and the co-
operative work of Natalie, Akari,
Selina and Sarah in attack - we
deserved to score [And on the pitch?
-Sports Eds],
I know everyone says that we're
crap. But we're not. We're pretty
damn good, actually. And we're get-
ting better...
Gunners (nearly) shoot to the
top in BUPC
Anyone awake on the morning of
Saturday February the twenty-sec-
ond would be forgiven for thinking
that they had walked onto the set of
"Night of the living dead." A group
of pale, dishevelled creatures stag-
gered, as if in a trance, descended on
the sports centre. In fact this was
merely members of the IC pistol
squad trying to make the seven
O'Clock start time for the British
University Pistol Championships.
The IC rifle and pistol club was
there this year and had high hopes to
place well. Captain Rickee delivered
us to Bisley just in time to begin the
morning's shooting of small bore tar-
get pistol. We fell immediately
behind, but were no demoralised as
.22 is for girls anyway.
The afternoon saw some superb
shooting of full bore revolvers by all
teams involved. After a day dogged
by jamming guns and other technical
problems, it was a credit to IC that all
three teams still managed to finish in
second place, yet again hammering
our arch-rivals Cambridge (we're not
afraid of them. Grrrrrrrrrr).
After this sterling performance
and the night's revelries that fol-
lowed, one would have thought that a
Sunday lie in was in order. Instead,
however, we all congregated in Hyde
park (along with about twenty-five
thousand others) for a sportsman's
association march and rally to protest
against the new gun legislation.
This was thoroughly groovy hap-
pening, only slightly marred by the
extreme ugliness of the Oxford pistol
team, the winners of the BUPC.
The nest event in our calender is
the Courtman Shield on Saturday
March the eighth. This is an intercol-
legiate rifle competition.
Shooters go on the pull
A dozen shooters went to Hawley in
Kent to try their hands at clay pigeon
shooting. After a brief introduction,
the motley crew settled down to a
twenty-five bird sporting layout (for
the uninitiated: bird = clay pigeon;
sporting layout = one way of posi-
tioning the clay pigeon launchers and
timing of the "birds" being flung up
in the air) followed by some skeet
shooting ( = another way of position-
ing the launchers - this time they
come from the left and right simulta-
neously). The guns were as assorted
as the shooters, ranging from a
Russian hammer gun bought in a pub
for £50 to Lawrence's £20 000
Purdey purchased for him at birth by
his father. The scores were variable
but the best of the day was by David
the Hairdresser (special rates for stu-
dents) closely followed by David
Childs, to a rather low score from
Stavros.
Marcos Dakalakalakalakalakas
suffered injuries to his trigger finger
when he fell out of his pram while
crying about French culture. Tea was
taken in Dartford followed by beer in
Southside where everyone was
impressed by Lee's impression of a
second-hand beer dispensing
machine in an impromptu game of
"Whose Line is it Anyway." involv-
ing tomfoolery with belisha beacons.
The Courtman Shield match has
been moved to the eighth of March to
allow the City and Guilds dream
team to shoot for Great Britain, so
make a note in your diary. More clay
pigeon shooting will take place
around Easter and everyone (even
non-members) are welcome. See the
notices in the range when they go up.
