Skiers have a (snow) ball
On Saturday evening, two football
fans (Nick and Gilles) joined three
other eager skiers (Cait, Ruffina and
Dan) after the Man Utd-Chelsea
game for a race at Hillingdon ski cen-
tre. This was the final stage of the
Huskis race series, and the evening
started with individual racing.
Gilles (Ginardelli's fellow coun-
tryman) had a quiet start as it was his
first race since his accident. An
excellent second run placed him
tenth in his age group.
After a storming first run provi-
sionally placed her first in her group,
Ruffina had a bit of bad luck in the
second and fell due to going into her
inside edge. This also scuppered her
chances of a high placing in the indi-
vidual tables.
This wasn't to be the last of our
bad luck. Cait, our star racer and
favourite in the overall girls event,
clipped a gate in her first run, spin-
ning her through 180 degrees and
destroying her chances. She however
proved she was the best in her second
run as she finished it in 13.49 sees,
some 0.55 ahead of the next competi-
tor. Nick finished two good runs with
a total time of 29.04, putting him sec-
ond in his age group and ninth over-
all. Finally Dan had a good run with
two of his best runs this season - his
aggregate time of 29.26 placing him
third in his group and fifth overall.
These results put IC in second
place, behind Holloway. In the final
event of the day, our true potential
finally showed by winning the dual
team slalom. Even though we had a
tough draw we beat Holloway in the
quarter-finals, leaving us Hillingdon
in the semis. With a bit of luck and
good planning we pressured one of
their racers to miss a gate and quali-
fied for the final.
In the final we triumphed glorious-
ly due to the collective effort of the
team, with some outstanding starting
and racing by Gilles and from Cait
who withstood the pressure of having
the second best racer of the day on
her tail.
The only thing left to say is that we
truly kicked some butt!
Dream win for Arabian knights
By Saiful Alam
The long awaited OSC 5-a-side foot-
ball tournament finally took place on
Sunday 16th February. The event
was sponsored by Sport and Leisure
(aka - IC Sports Centre).
Only eight societies turned up with
squads on the day, but the favourites
were all there. Some of the others
blamed the weekends' 'open-hous-
es', parties and fiestas for their play-
ers' absences.
Two groups of four teams were
drawn, and the top two from each
were allowed to go on to play for the
honours. The four others were fight-
ing it out for pride.
Although there was some tension
during the games - there were no
major outbursts, as anticipated by the
organisers. In general, the games
were played in good spirit.
It was a 'funny old tournament'.
The Bangladeshi All Stars beat the
Turkish Delights in the third place
play-off even though the Turks
thrashed the Bangladeshis in the
qualifiers. Similarly, the High-flying
Hellenics were unbeaten all day, but
they were outplayed by the Arabian
Knights when it mattered most - in
the finals.
On behalf of the OSC I would like
to thank Sport and Leisure for their
support, Alex Neilsen for organising
the event, and all the participants
who made this event a success. There
are plans for this making this tourna-
ment an annual event from here on.
Finally, congratulations to the Arabic
Society team - "maashaallah".
BUSA de-booster for fourths
A defeat in BUSA spells the end of a
glorious run, but the fourths need to
pick themselves up from this defeat
and concentrate on the league.
It all went pear-shaped in the first
few minutes when our keeper mis-
judged a routine shot, and then
another defensive mistake put IC two
down after only ten minutes.
In truth there was no way back
from here against a strong Anglian
side, but brave, or in hindsight fool-
ish, substitutions gave IC a sniff. In
the second half we got it back to 2-1
and then 3-2, with the supremely
gifted Morgan expertly finishing
from a Nak pass, and a brilliant solo
goal from Pete.
Pushing men forward in the final
minutes and defensive errors meant
that U E A secured the win. We were
by no means disgraced, but if the
mistakes by the captain and keeper
had been cut-out it could have been
oh so different.

Rugby ref ruck-up
Well, we have some good news and
some bad news. Good news - we
won. Bad news - we lost! The refer-
ee! Where was he? This lack of an
official referee resulted in us forfeit-
ing the game and so we have now
been knocked out of BUSA. True to
the spirit of IC rugby we played any-
way and the 32-12 scoreline in our
favour was not enough to secure an
official victory. All our efforts, and
those of star full-back Chris went to
waste. The bastard referee.
Uncontested scrums obviously
worked in our favour as the more
powerful forwards dominated in
rucks and mauls and the backs ran
rings round their opposite numbers.
Peachy's passing simply defied logic
(Julian "captain concrete" Harrison)
again. Manny mullered, Peachy prat-
tled on and Rob rampaged. Mart's
play was much improved after his
redemption at Church (or was it in
the toilet?), but his second row com-
patriate James Weekes, well, need
we say more [actually it would have
helped! Sp. Ed.s]. Grandad Bryce
was as reliable as ever in his turbo-
charged zimmer frame and Nipply
finally "scored". Charlie "Snake
Hips he prefers, Arse-bandit we pre-
fer" had a close shave, but "Chat the
cat" showed the Austin Healey in
him (i.e. an old knackered car) whilst
Keith, the 22 year old standoff-half
that he is, worried about his grey
hairs. Dave turned up - cheers.
Kolbne showed his "eau de" with
serious runs and big pants. Yomi
demonstrated his spacialist scrum-
half abilities. Bollocks! He tells me
that he scored a try but it was slight-
ly dubious. Nim "No Stud(s)" failed
utterly in his attempts to get on the
pitch because Manny and I [Rob
"Fluffy, shaving foam on his head"]
were just too good (well, fat).
"Thanks" go to Trefor for very quiet
support. Mo says Jasper is "well-fit."
All in all we had a great season,
but finally I feel that I must sum up.
Give us a C; give us a U; give us an
N; give us a T. And what have you
got... the referee.
Wind-sock win shock for firsts
For once, IC first footballers arrived
on time, and with a full team. After
UCL's last pasting by us we expect-
ed them not to show, only to be dis-
appointed when they turned up an
hour late. Conditions left a lot to be
desired with winds of at least one
hundred km/h but IC played solidly
in defence with some crunching
fouls from Psycho. It was nil-nil at
half time, when we were delighted to
see our short strider/defender/keeper
/boxer in the lovely red jacket, Tony.
This put the fear of God into UCL,
forcing them to score a superb own
goal. This was followed by a shotgun
right foot from Dave, making up for
his earlier one-on-one cock-up with
the notorious U C L keeper. In
remarkable conditions (Dicks play-
ing, Jules and Tony on the pitch at
full time, Chris Parsons in one piece
and flashbacks of the '87 storms).
So, another win for the firsts - no
thanks to Donal who was shit.

Fourths seconds away from
blowing seconds away
With a free date in their busy sched-
ule, IC II kindly agreed to play us,
the fourths, in a friendly. The match
was delayed while the less proud
members of the fourths clammered
to get their autographs. When it got
underway, it was clear that it was
going to be the proverbial game of
two halves, since the wind was so
strong. Goal kicks barely reached the
half-way line against the wind and
with it reached the other penalty box.
But it was not so; after winning the
toss the underdog fourths raced into a
deserved three-nil half-time lead.
Morgan scored with a "f*cking glori-
ous" opening goal, again with a
classy finish and completed his hat-
trick on the stroke of half-time.
The story read quite differently
after the restart, with the seconds
showing a bit of the class that we had
done well to stifle this long. We held
out until fifteen minutes before the
end when a clever short corner total-
ly outwitted our defence and their
captain planted a glorious header in
the back of our net. Minutes later our
'keeper was to blame - a punt upfield
landed in the box and bounced right
over the advancing Stu and into the
net. As the end of the match drew
nearer the seconds became more and
more desperate as they looked to be
completely humbled. It was not to
be, though, as in the dying seconds
their little striker nipped in to head in
the equaliser. In the end the wind was
the winner, Brian.
