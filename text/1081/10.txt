The Single Transferable Vote (STV) used in
Imperial College Union elections is a more
sophisticated, and some would say more
complicated system, to the nationally used
first past the post policy. STV allows stu-
dents to specify not just their first choice of
candidate, but also their second, third and
fourth. In the interests of 'transparency' and
in order to allow you to best use your vote,
below is a short description of how it all
works.
Filling out the ballot paper is clearly where
it all starts, and the number of votes you get
depends on the number of candidates. With
a maximum of four choices in this year's
elections you get to list your preference
from 1 to 4, with your most favoured person
getting a 1, the next a 2 etc. If you only
have eyes for one candidate then you do not
need to pick a 2,3 or 4, your vote is still
valid. In this instance you should still howev-
er use a 1, rather than a tick or a cross.
When all the tens of thousands of ballot
papers are collected initially only the 1s are
considered and each candidate's first prefer-
ence vote is counted. To win an ICU sabbati-
cal election in the first round, a candidate
needs to receive more than 50% of the valid
votes. If one of the candidates has achieved
this wonderful ideal, he is declared the win-
ner and the count is finished.
If however, as is more likely, none of the
possibles has managed to inspire such a
level of support the second round of count-
ing kicks in. The candidate with the least
number of votes is now eliminated and his
papers re-examined to consider his voters
second preferences. All the 2s are now dis-
tributed to the remaining candidates and the
totals recalculated.
This process continues until one candidate
reaches the magical 50% figure. While this
may seem a protracted system, counting is
unlikely to take as long as one recent elec-
tion in one of the UK's near neighbours
where over seven days of counting was
needed to elect one particular member of
Parliament.
Just in case the above still sounds compli-
cated here's an example of what might hap-
pen:
Imagine in an ideal world where the Spice
Girls suddenly grew brains and were all
studying at Imperial College. Being ambi-
tious types they all decide to run for Imperial
College Union President, opposed of course
by the ubiquitous New Election.
Suppose having examined their
policies in detail you reckon that the
two Mels are on the ball but the rest
are rather lacking in the ideas
department you might decide to
vote like this:
Mel C 1
Mel B 2
New Election 3
Emma 4
Victoria 5
Geri 6
All the votes are counted, with the highest
turnout ever for an ICU election, and each
candidate polls as follows:
Emma 3,000
Mel B 1,500
New Election 800
Mel C 700
Geri 600
Victoria 400
Spoilt Papers 100
A total of 7,100 people vote, but unfortu-
nately 100 didn't read this advice and failed
to fill in their ballot paper properly. This
therefore leaves quota, or number votes Â»
needed for success, at 3,501 or [(7,100 -
100) / 2 ]+ 1. Clearly Emma falls just short of
the target so now Victoria's first preference
vote is examined and her 2s are counted. Of
the 400 papers, 300 have given Emma a 2,
50 have given Geri a 2 and another fifty only
had eyes for Victoria. This leaves the
recounted votes like this:
Emma 3,300
Mel B 1,500
New Election 800
Mel C 700
Geri 650
Spoilt Papers 100
Non Transferable 50
The new quota is now 3,301 or [(7,100 - 100
- 50) / 2 ]+ 1, which Emma just misses. Next
for the chop is Geri and her 600 1st prefer-
ence and the 50 votes she got from Victoria
are now examined for their respective 2s
and 3s. These are then added to the previ-
ous figures and the totals are now as fol-
lows:
Emma 3,600
Mel B 1,500
MeIC 1,000
New Election 800
Spoilt Papers 100
Non Transferable 100
Emma has jumped her final hurdle and is
duly elected as the President of Imperial
College Union, to tumultuous applause.
"If you don't vote your
testicles will fall off. It's
a proven medical fact."
Well, maybe not, but this is you big
chance to have a say in how the Union
is run. It's easy. You don't have to sit on
any boring committees, and it only takes
a minute to do.
Whatever you do, the Union does
affect you. So please take the time to
vote.
