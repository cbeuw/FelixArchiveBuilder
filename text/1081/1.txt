New Election favourite after Kheir withdraws
N E W S T E A M
The result of next week's Imperial
College Union Sabbatical Elections
hangs in the balance today, follow-
ing the shock withdrawal of one of
the two Presidential candidates.
Omar Kheir, considered by many as
the favourite for the job, confirmed
his withdrawal from the elections
yesterday leaving Samantha Baker
standing agianst 'New Election'.
Mr Kheir's withdrawal follows a
series of rumours concerning his
health and the pressures of his work
as a postgraduate in the Electrical
Engineering Department. Mr Kheir
met Eric Allsop, the current ICU
President, early yesterday morning
to comfirm his withdrawal from the
sabbatical race.
At the time of going to press, Mr
Kheir was unavailable for comment,
but Mr Allsop later outlined some of
the factors contributing to his deci-
sion. The former candidate has been
ill for the last two weeks, and was
only able to attend the College
briefly to write his name on the nom-
ination papers. This may explain the
lack of a campus-wide poster cam-
paign promoting Mr Kheir, as is tra-
ditional for ICU sabbatical candi-
dates.
In addition, Mr Kheir's Electrical
Engineering research team is report-
ed to be facing a critical publication
deadline for their work, in direct
competition with other groups. Mr
Kheir is believed to have been under
severe pressure from his supervisor,
with a suggestion that his PhD might
be in jeopardy were he to devote too
much time to his Presidential cam-
paign.
As returning officer for the elec-
tions, Mr Allsop expressed regret
concerning Omar's decision. He
claimed to be "saddened by the lack
of competition" in the race for the
post of Union President, which now
sees Royal College of Science Acad-
emic Affairs Officer Samantha
Baker as the single, uncontested can-
didate. Speaking to Felix, Miss
Baker admitted "I still have to con-
vince students that I'm the best can-
didate... I will continue campaigning
as before."
Following this week's farcical
hustings, and the lacklustre cam-
paigning by some candidates, many
students voting in Monday and
Tuesday's election may choose to
return 'New Election' for the posi-
tion of President. Were this the case,
nominations for President would be
reopened, allowing new and poten-
tially better candidates to stand.
Although unusual, such a result
seems increasingly likely as medical
students at St Mary's Hospital Med-
ical may choose to 'block vote' for a
new election; It is believed that the
medics had originally planned to
vote for Mr Kheir, who now openly
supports the re-opening of nomina-
tions. Many students at the South
Kensington campus have similarly
expressed their disaffection towards
the candidates standing for all four
posts.
Were the ICU Presidential elec-
tions to be re-held, a number of
prospective candidates have hinted
that they might stand. Robin Riley,
ICU's Publications Board Chairman,
is alleged to have signed a statement
confirming his intention to run for
the post. Another likely candidate
may be Royal College of Science
Union President, Mo Dulloo. "At the
moment I can't say anything" said
Mr Dulloo, but went on to say "Once
a new election's certain, it will be an
interesting contest with Robin."
A precedent for a new presidential
election to be run was set in 1974
when the race was run four times.
Anger at hustings debacle
N E W S T E A M
The low turnout for both of this
week's sabbatical election hustings,
on Tuesday in South Kensington and
on Wednesday in St Mary's, with
few impartial observers attending
has once again demonstrated the
lack of student interest in Union
affairs.
Jeremy Thomson, standing unop-
posed for the position of Felix Edi-
tor, refused to be drawn regarding
his plans for Felix next year, but
highlighted his background as Arts
Editor. He faced particular hostility
from St Mary's over his ignorance
regarding topical medical issues.
Next up were the two candidates
standing for Deputy President
(Clubs&Societies), Sarah Thomas
and Smita Chaturvedi, who con-
firmed that they came from similar
hockey backgrounds, and who man-
aged to give similar answers to many
of the questions. Ms Thomas' pro-
poser got the biggest cheer of the
night from the medics when she
responded to a frontal flanning with
"Let's face it, it's not the first time
that I've had cream on my tits and it
won't be the last."
The post of Deputy President
(Finance&Services) had three candi-
dates, Rob Clark, John Savery and
Duncan Tindall, whose manifestos
and answers had strikingly few dif-
ferences between them. One notable
incident was Mr Clark's downing of
eight pints in quick succession.
The two candidates for ICU Presi-
dent, Sam Baker and Omar Kheir,
proved the most controversial with
general incredulity at their flippant
approach to the South Kensington
hustings and their ignorance of seri-
ous issues.
At first event Sam proposed turn-
ing ICU into a brothel with Omar
retorting with his wish to see a
playpen in Beit Quad. After the sec-
ond hustings Piers Williams, current
DP(F&S) and co-ordinator of the
New Election campaign, commented
to Felix that he would have said
more on behalf of New Election but
felt that it wasn't needed as "all the
other candidates seemed to be doing
my job for me."
