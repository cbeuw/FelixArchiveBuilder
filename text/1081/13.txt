The weekly poem
by PoetIC
THE FAINT SPICY SMELL OF YOUR FATHER'S CIGARS
By chance we met
Yesterday, after half a lifetime apart
And to my surprise
Deep love, long forgotten
Welled up, consuming me
And then, so clear in my memory
Was that faint spicy smell of your father's cigars
Do you remember how we met?
In the train compartment
Sitting in opposite comers
Faces not entirely unfamiliar
From our daily journeys home from school
I looking shyly into my window
Trying to decipher your intermittent reflection
Pretending not to notice that you were sketching me
And when we reached our destination
You followed me off the train, clutching your picture
Caught up with me, and awkwardky showed me your work
I was impressed by your courage
And when I inspected my portrait
I was strangely not embarrassed
By the dreadful regulation hat
And your several attempts at the snubby schoolgirl nose
And later when you took me out
Do you remember the slow walks home on dark Winter nights?
Along the muddy cinder track?
The wide black silence
The overgrown hedges with thistles and wet bramble leaves
The many halts when you would kiss me
And occasionally, the brief clattering of a lighted train
Passing through the cutting below?
Do you remember
The night we saw the glow worm?
The brilliant sphere of glowing yellow light
Illuminating the blackness
It made you kiss me all the more
So secure, so certain
But as my cheek pressed against your shoulder
In a distant corner of my mind
I was waiting for something more
Uncertain, unsettling
Unknown, disturbing
And held there, tightly, against your coat
I was vaguely aware
Of that faint spicy smell of your father's cigars
