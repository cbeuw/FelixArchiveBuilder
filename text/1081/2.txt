Professor Bryan Coles dies aged 71
JEREMY C L A R K E
Bryan Randell Coles FRS, Emeritus
Professor and Senior Research
Fellow of Solid State Physics from
1991 died suddenly on Monday at 2
am. Born in Cardiff in 1926, Bryan
Coles attended Cardiff High School
and achieved a first in Metallurgy
from the University of Wales in
1947. He came to the Department of
Physics at Imperial in 1950 as a lec-
turer in Metal Physics and a year
later gained his D.Phil, from Jesus
College, Oxford.
On leave from London in
Pittsburgh, Professor Coles was the
International Co-operation
Administration Fellow at the
Carnegie Institute for two years from
1954. Three years later, he was
appointed Senior Lecturer in Physics
at Imperial and then a Reader in
Physics in 1962. Professor Coles
spent the summers of 1962 and 1969
as a Visiting Professor at the
University of California in San
Diego. In October of 1966 he was
appointed to the Chair of Solid State
Physics at Imperial. Closely associat-
ed with both the planning and fur-
nishing of the new Physics building,
the Blackett Laboratory, Professor
Coles took a keen interest in the
development of the College. Before
being appointed Dean of the Royal
College of Science from 1984-1986,
he spent the end of 1983 as Hill
Visiting Professor at the University
of Minnesota. From 1986-1991,
Professor Coles was Pro-Rector of
Imperial College and was then elect-
ed to be a Fellow of the Royal
Society, where he Chaired the
Scientific Information Committee
from 1993.
As Nevill Mott has said, Professor
Coles had devoted his career to the
experimental investigation of metal-
lic alloys and their interpretation in
the language of quantum mechanics.
Not only this, but also his work in the
field of spin glasses has resulted in
world-wide renown. Professor Coles
provided inspired leadership in all
his work and warm hospitality to the
many eminent people who visited
him, and to the students taught by
him over his years at Imperial. His
inaugural lecture was received with
praise and showed his facility with

language, an ability founded on his
sense of humour and considerable
knowledge of English Literature.
Professor Coles was a member,
and frequently chairman, of many
international committees, including
the International Institute Laue-
Langevin, the International Council
of Scientific Unions Abstracting
Board and was IUPAP representative
for several years. He served on the
Advisory Panel on Study
Institutions, NATO Science
Division, and was a member of the
British National Committee on
Physics. During 1955, Professor
Coles married Merivan Robinson of
St. Paul, Minnesota and leaves two
sons. In his private life, Professor
Coles pursued interests in natural
history, mediaeval architecture and
opera. Having retired at the begin-
ning of the academic term 1991, he
continued to take an active interest in
both his work and the College itself,
being Staff Orator from 1991-1993.
His death is a considerable loss to
both the College and the scientific
world, and he will be sorely missed
by all who knew him.
Dramsoc
ripped- off?
N E W S T E A M
Recent attempts to publicise
Dramsoc's upcoming production of
Christopher Marlowe's Edward II
have run into difficulties after over
forty posters were ripped off the
Sherfield walkway notice boards.
Speaking to Felix Mike Wyer,
Dramsoc's publicity officer,
described how an evening's work
was mysteriously censored
overnight.
With less than half a dozen posters
remaining from the original fifty,
speculation is rife as to why bizarre
and possibly malicious attack
occurred. Since the play deals with
sex, violence, and gay relationships
it has been suggested that homopho-
bic tendencies may have taken
offence. Dramsoc sources have
denied allegation that they may have
incited animosity from other
Imperial College Union clubs or
societies, and insist that they will be
protesting to the Union.
Suggestions that this week's high
winds may be responsible for the
posters disappearance have been dis-
counted by Dramsoc members.
News in Brief
UNION BAR WRECKED
The Royal School of Mines won the
"bottle match" against the
Cambourne School of Mines last
Saturday. That evening, the Union
bar was packed, and some of the fix-
tures sustained a significant amount
of damage. Two tables were trashed,
one with its top smashed, the other
had its legs broken.
There was another incident when
a large shield was pulled down from
the wall, damaging the wall in the
process.

BAND BANNED
One of the bands that played in last
week's 'Abandon" were told to
watch their behaviour if they wanted
to play again at the Union. POG, the
first band out of four to play on
Friday night, were reprimanded after
their lead singer pretended to light
up a spliff on stage at the end of their
performance.
Mark Home, the Union Ents man-
ager, explained,. "We are currently
applying for a public entertainments
license, and we need to keep a snow-
white clean reputation. The Union
has put a lot of money into this ven-
ture. The application itself cost about
£4,000, as well as spending almost
£100,000 on dBs to bring it up to
standard. Our application is now
being processed, and we are at the
stage where we can be inspected at
any time. A licensing officer may
not have seen the joke. It would have
been a pity for the behaviour of one
person to have jeopardised all this
with one childish gesture. It was a
very silly thing to do."
The band insist that it was simply
meant as a joke, and were surprised
at the reaction they provoked.
However, Mark did concede, "It
was a very good pretend spliff,
though."
