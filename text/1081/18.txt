National triumph for pot-heads
After a good run of recent wins
Imperial College Union's Snooker
team set off for the BUSA Nationals
in Warwick with high hopes. In the
first day's singles tournament Alex,
Jon and Vay all reached the last six-
teen, but back problems forced Alex
to pull out and posed a worry for the
team event.. Vay narrowly lost his
match, but Jon kept Imperial's flag
cruised through their first group
stage; winning against Trinity
College Carmarthen (8 - 0), Hull (7 -
1) and Southampton (7-1). In the
next phase they again found the
going easy with wins over Hull (7-1,
again) and highly fancied U E A (6 -
2). By the next day Alex had recov-
ered sufficiently to win a vital match
to beat hosts Warwick 6 - 3 in the
flying with two more wins before
losing in the semi-final to the eventu-
al champion from UEA. In the B-
team singles competition, Phil and
Asif both progressed to the last six-
teen, at which point Phil beat Asif,
and with two further wins reached
the final. Some fine all-round play
from Phil Davies overwhelmed his
Warwick opponent to be crowned
National Champion.
In the B-team event, wins over
Bristol (7 - 3) and Southampton (6 -
4) were not quite enough after a loss
against Queen's Belfast (2 - 8) to
allow IC to progress to the last four,
cutting short a promising campaign
for the team of Phil Davies, Russel
Towers, Tim Dann, Kevin Camadoo
and Asif Kassam. For the A-team the
loss of Alex for the first day's com-
petition was overcome as they
quarter-final. Next, Queen's provid-
ed a sterner test, but 2 - 0 wins by
Simon and Vay and a final frame win
by Alex put Imperial into their first
ever final. Here, against Bristol they
began well with a win by Vay over
their No. 1 and a 2 - 0 win by Simon.
This left Imperial almost home and
needing one more match for victory.
This turned into a race between
Spike and Jon to be first to win their
match, with Jon eventually pipping
Spike to clinch the title for Imperial.
Thus, Imperial's A-team of Simon
Baugh, Alex Robinson, Jon Fulcher,
Vay Ly and Spike Milligan were
crowned National Team Champions
for the first time. The A-team win,
combined with Phil's B-team sin-
gles triumph made Imperial the most
successful University team at the
Championships.
Fluffy fledglings fly far
Last weekend the IC Novice Squad
raced at the Hammersmith Double
Header. The course was from
Chiswich to Hammersmith, and
despite some rough and windy con-
ditions all our crews performed very
well, the men's novice A crew won
their category by a minute and a half
and obtained an impressive second
place overall. This was backed up by
the men's B crew who came second
in their category, and seventh in the
whole race. The women's novice
eight also raced and won their cate-
gory, beating a Thames Tradesman
crew and finishing fifteenth overall.
A very impressive set of results for
the novices.
Runners and riders rule relay
In an unprecedented amalgamation
of the cross-country and cycling
clubs, Gaffer (Demetrius) and
Tazman (Tarik) took part in the infa-
mous Evans Ghoulie Grind duathlon
on Sunday. Waking up at five in the
morning and forsaking their usual
fine, hale and hearty breakfasts, the
two athletes headed for Guildford in
their souped-up yellow Fiesta, find-
ing their way to the race by means of
tailing a car with bikes on the back of
it.
When the race began, Gaffer shot
off to an early start, going on to tack-
le the three mile cross-country run
and only lost a few places. With an
almost instantaneous change-over,
Tazman hurtled down the first decent
of the twelve and a half mile bike
ride. However, soon the going got
tough with the 1:7 climbs which give
the race its name. After a storming
and lung-busting ride, it was Gaffer's
turn again to run the remaining two
and a half miles of this gut-wrench-
ing event. After a well deserved
breakfast, the results came through
and positioned the "IC Crew" as the
2nd relay team. With this encourag-
ing performance the team aim to take
the event by the balls next year.
Hull of a bad time for rugby lads
After a marathon five hour journey
we reached Hull, which put the team
off, except maybe Alasdair who
found the Humber Bridge "exciting."
After 45 minutes of traipsing through
the most dismal town in the North,
we eventually found the pitch thanks
to Tom's unerring direction sense.
The pitch was as muddy and undu-
lating as the rest of Humberside.
From the kick-off our forwards
showed their power and we camped
in their territory until half-time, by
which point we were leading 8 - 5
thanks to a try from Alasdair and a
penalty from Paul. We were unlucky
not be further ahead, with a try disal-
lowed.
After finding that Northerners
could not afford oranges or water at
half-time [Oi watch it, Sports Ed.],
we turned around to face what had
suddenly become a very strong head-
wind. Disheartened that even the ele-
ments were against us, we started to
lose our poise. Humberside took
advantage and not even our strong
running could save the match, deny-
ing us a place in the quarter-finals.
Retiring to the changing rooms (
which incidentally were unlit), we
were intrigued by the fact that in
Hull, the women's rugby team use
the men's showers. Unimpressed
with the Hull RFC facilities we
rejoined our storming coach drivers
for the journey back to the Union.
We apologise to Capital Coaches for
what Gudmund did to the toilet.
