The counselling
service does
not work as
advertised
An anonymous student thinks that there
needs to be significant change to the
services that the college provides for
severe mental health problems

stressed at uni at
some point. If you
don’t, I applaud
your Jedi level
of inner peace.
But for the rest of us mere
mortals, it hits at some point.
Because it affects everyone, I
just assumed that what I was
feeling was normal, that my
course was always going to
be a tough one and it would
have its harder moments. For
the first year, that was true. I
managed the steep learning
curve and new social setting
with a normal number of
bumps in the road. But last
summer, and at the start of
the winter term, an onlooker
would have seen things take a
turn for the worse. I, however,
didn’t think anything of it for a
long time.
I finally got a sense that
things were not normal when
I was feeling so despairing
that I couldn’t move or speak,
and getting out of bed was
harder than the current run
up to exams. I wasn’t learning

anything in my lecture courses
because I felt like I had no
future and that nothing I did
would amount to anything. I
was avoiding mirrors because
my self-image was so bad that
being reminded of it would
make me want to harm myself.
You get the idea.
When the alarm bells finally
rang in my head, I contacted
the counselling service. It
took two weeks to arrange
an initial visit. Once I got
there and alarm bells rang for
them as well, I was prioritised
counselling sessions. That took
three weeks to happen. So,
a month after reaching out
in one of the most miserable
points in my life, I was greeted
with the question, “What
would you like to do?” I don’t
normally articulate the details
of what is running through
my head when I feel like
shit, but I believe I need the
description of the pit I was in
to make it clear how much of
an unhelpful question that is.
“What I would like to do is get
better” was what I thought,
but ‘get better’ doesn’t really
work in the timescale of the
seven appointments they offer.
Someone like me who saw no
way out and no happiness in
the future doesn’t know how
to get better on their own. I
don’t like making sweeping
or perversely grandiose
statements, but the reality is
that there is a good chance
that in my position with maybe
a few less friends, and a
slightly less supportive family,
I may have killed myself if all
that was there to stop me was
the counselling service.
In retrospect, the support
they offered me would
probably have been good if
I had more acute exam stress
or just a relatively small bout
of low mood. But someone
who can’t get out of bed isn’t
going to drag themselves to
a stress workshop where they
can’t share how they feel with
a professional, or go back and
forth over emails for a month
to try and see someone.
Do I think my bad experience
is the fault of the people who
workthere?No.Notatall.They
are no doubt trying to offer
the best possible care they can
to as many students as they
can. The time delay between
my first email and my first
session was due to the under-
staffing of the service, which
is no doubt oversubscribed
because of the high-pressure
environment at Imperial. My
frustration is, in a sense, not
directed at the counsellor that
I saw, but at the college for
claiming to offer a service to
help with severe mental health
problems, without employing
the correct staff to deal with it.
The service is not to help with
clinical depression, but with
short term issues such as stress.
The purpose of the service
has been misrepresented,
meaning that people like
me do not receive the help
they need. Those who need
immediate help are put on
long waiting lists so that by the
time their allotted appointment
arrives, the issue has already
resolved. Moreover, there is
not nearly enough information
about other places to get help
besides counselling, such as
your GP.
If you find yourself agreeing
with anything I wrote at the
start of this piece, see a GP
as soon as possible. If you’re
feeling worse than normal but
not as bad as what I described,
the counselling service may
well be fine for you. But, in
my opinion, if you feel worse
than you ever thought you
could, I simply cannot bring
myself to recommend making
the counselling service in its
current form to be your first
point of call.
I do want this to change.
That’s why I’m writing this.
This year has seen many steps
forward, including the creation
of the Mental Health Officer,
but it is not enough. Every
student should be involved
with improving mental health,
as it will affect every one of us
at some point in our time here.
Until my experience can never
happen to another student
again, we must continue to
campaign for change.
