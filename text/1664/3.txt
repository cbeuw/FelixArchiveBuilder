Fossil fuel divestment finally on the table
Fossil fuel funding may soon be withdrawn
Joanna Wormald
F
ollowing the
resurrection of the
Imperial divestment
campaign, a paper
brought to this
week’s Union Council
meeting set out proposals
for the future of fossil fuels at
Imperial.
The Divest Imperial Council
Paper recognises that the
majority of currently available
fossil fuels must not be used if
we are to limit global warming
increases to the generally
accepted upper limit of 2°C.
Not only are fossil fuels a
significant threat to the future
of the planet, they have been
linked to cases of human rights
abuses in the developing
world. These facts have
prompted student protests,
leading to one quarter of UK
universities to pursue some
form of divestment.
At present, Imperial has
£5.4 million directly invested
in fossil fuel companies. This
does not include further
unspecified amounts that
are indirectly invested via
externally managed funds.
This is claimed to be one of
the largest investments in fossil
fuels by universities in the UK.
The Imperial mission
statement mentions a
commitment “to address the
difficult challenges of today
and the future.” As part of
this, the Union believes that
Imperial should be at the
forefront of tackling climate
change. Divestment is a
chance for Imperial to support
and promote sustainable
technology. More importantly,
the fossil fuel industry has
“irreconcilable” differences
with Imperial values. These
differences include a “dubious
ethical record”, “intellectual
dishonesty”, and a “persistent
disregardfortheenvironment.”
Divestment could be a way of
forcing fossil fuel companies
to change their behaviour. On
a more pragmatic note, failure
to divest could leave Imperial
with stranded financial assets
due to rising carbon levels and
an increased cost of burning
fossil fuels.
Concerns were raised at the
meeting about how divestment
might affect the relationship
between Imperial and the
companies in which it currently
invests, many of which provide
our students with jobs and
funding for their research.
Following what was described
by Abigail de Bruin as “a fair
amount of questioning”, the
general consensus seemed to
be that the many universities
that have already successfully
divested have faced no
obvious negative effects and
there’s no reason why this
shouldn’t also be the case at
Imperial.
The Union proposes an
immediate freeze on further
fossil fuel investment. To begin
the actual divestment process,
the Union sets out a five-year
target to withdraw investments
in the fossil fuel industry.
For those investments made
indirectly via commingled
funds, it is believed that it
should be relatively easy to
discover where money is being
poured into fossil fuel firms and
redirect it to other companies.
Any future investments would
be subject to student and
staff consultation to ensure
compliance with Imperial
values and mission statements.
The campaign would be
publicised in the Union
newsletter, social media, and
a dedicated website.
The paper has so far been
passed only in principle due to
the meeting not being quorate
(following minor amendments,
the council will vote via email)
but there are reasons to be
optimistic about the future
of divestment at Imperial.
Union backing lends weight
to any campaign. We have
already seen how pressure
from students has achieved
divestment commitments
at King’s College London,
Oxford University, and the
London School of Economics.
It remains to be seen whether
the same success will be
repeated at Imperial.

Migrant students gain financial aid

A
n interesting
paper at
this week’s
Union Council
m e e t i n g
a d d r e s s e d
the issues faced by asylum-
seekers and migrants trying
to access higher education in
London.
To study at a UK university,
asylum-seekers and migrants
with Discretionary Leave
to Remain (DLR) or Limited
Leave to Remain (LLR) must
pay international tuition
fees without the help of
student finance, for which
they are ineligible. At one
London-based organisation,
500 young people have
sought legal advice to help
them achieve their dreams
of studying in a London
university.
Many universities offer
scholarships to help with
the rising cost of studying in
London. UCL, KCL, and City
University offer a combined
total of 11 scholarships
specifically directed at asylum-
seekers and migrants with DLR
or LLR status. Imperial offers
no such aid. There isn’t even a
mention of asylum-seekers or
migrants in either the College’s
Diversity Policy or Access
Agreement.
It doesn’t have to be this
way. Imperial can control
what tuition fees it charges
and what financial assistance
it offers to specific groups of
applicants. The paper cites
“exceptional” students and
staff with DLR or LLR status as
proof of the talent and value
that migrants contribute to the
College. The paper claims that
is therefore the “duty” of the
College to embrace its identity
as an “institution taking pride
in its diversity” and remove
the financial barriers that
prevent education being
fairly accessible to all. Doing
so would allow Imperial to
become “a true representative
of equality and diversity in
higher education.”
Discussion at the meeting
focussed on the risks of a
student’s refugee status being
suddenly rescinded, which
could lead to the student
having to leave the country
before the completion of their
course. The worry was whether
Imperial should be effectively
“incentivising” people to join
the College in the knowledge
that they may not have the
chance to finish their degree.
It was agreed that this should
be considered on a case-by-
case basis and should not get
in the way of Imperial offering
similar scholarships to those
already available or being
discussed at other universities.
It was also noted that Imperial
was not being asked to provide
hundreds of scholarships at
short notice but for an effort
to be made to provide at least
one scholarship for those that
need it.
The Union has resolved to run
a campaign which would help
asylum-seekers and migrants
face the costs of studying at
Imperial. This would come
in the form of financial aid
packages offered to those
settledintheUK.Therearealso
plans to lobby the College to
review the tuition fee status of
asylum-seekers and migrants,
awarding home status to
anyone that would normally
be eligible (i.e. those that have
been resident in the UK for at
least three years). The final
pledge aims to ensure that
Imperial formally contributes
to existing initiatives that seek
to improve access to higher
education for asylum-seekers
and migrants.
Aswithotherpapersheardat
this meeting, an email vote will
be held, though it has already
been passed in principle.
With a growing refugee crisis
and net immigration levels of
273,000 in the year ending
September 2016, these
proposals could not come at a
better time.
