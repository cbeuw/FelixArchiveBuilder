Fuelling the
resistance
Naomi Pratt addresses the global
struggle against extractivism
T
he greatest obstacle
to action on climate
change is the one
most often missing
from discourse:
the fossil fuel
industry. Since comprehension
of anthropogenic global
warming began, the fossil fuel
industry has been ignored in
negotiations and subsidised by
governments. Much time and
energy has been spent over
the past decades to reduce
consumption of fossil fuels and
greenhouse gas emissions,
both on an individual as
well as on a collective level.
However, whether the fix
is energy-saving light bulbs
or the Paris Agreement, our
efforts are undermined by the
refusal to address fossil fuel
supply. A striking example of
this cognitive dissonance is the
UK’s commitment to an 80%
reduction in emissions by 2050
under the Climate Change Act
(2008);nowrenderedvirtually
worthless by the Infrastructure
Act (2015) which forces future
governments to maximise UK
petroleum recovery.
The fossil fuel industry
spends millions on PR and
CSR (corporate social
responsibility) to craft a
wholesome and generous
public image. They also
invest large amounts in
lobbying efforts, in order
to exert political influence
and ensure that extractivism
continues unabated. Their
primary obligation is to
their shareholders, requiring
‘sustainable’ growth and
profitability: a goal which
requires continual exploration.

Once fossil fuels are
extracted, they are inevitably
going to be burnt; if not in the
country of production, then
they will be exported and
burnt elsewhere. If we are to
achieve climate justice, fossil
fuels must be, quite simply,
kept in the ground.
These companies, therefore,
must dramatically change
their operations; if they won’t,
then society must allow them
to fail. Big Oil has gone to
huge lengths already to
defend business as usual, from
sponsoring climate denying
politicians to supporting wars
against civilians, suggesting
that they are unlikely to
change, and their failure is our
only hope.
Outside of our corner
of the world blinkered by
consumerism, direct resistance
against Big Oil has been
raging for decades. In some
of these ‘sacrifice zones’, oil
companies and the regimes
they support can literally get
away with murder, as was the
case in the brutal treatment of
the Ogoni in the Niger Delta.
In this case Shell settled to
the tune of $15.5m, after a
long struggle by local people
whose home and livelihoods
were devastated by the
industry’s actions.
Localism is a potent tool
when resisting resource
extraction – voices with strong
ties to place and landscape
bring forward social justice
as a cornerstone of the
environmental movement.
No struggle reflects this more
than the powerful defiance
of the Standing Rock Sioux
at Oceti Sakowin protest
camp, recently broken
up in a highly militarised
expulsion. Indigenous activists
engaged in peaceful civil
disobedience for months in
protest to the Dakota Access
Pipeline, a project which
disregards their land treaty
rights in an extension of the
oppression Native Americans
have long suffered. Support
reverberated throughout the
US, including a thousand-
strong march on Washington,
and continues through legal
action and divestment. The
pipeline, which could become
fully operational this year, has
already had its first spill.
Though cries of ‘nimby
(Not In My Back Yard) -ism’
can often be heard from
defenders of the industry, and
echoed tacitly by governments
overriding local consent, those
on the front line are fighting for
everyone’s back yard, not just
their own. In 2014, prominent
writer Naomi Klein defined
the term ‘Blockadia’: a new
transnational zone of conflict
where people whose lives are
at the border with extractive
industries fight for control over
their water, soil and air.
Despite already holding
more fuel in reserves than we
can safely burn, continuing
with exploration – using ever
riskier methods – means the
industry now faces battles on
multiple fronts. Communities
which have historically been
more privileged are joining
the struggles alongside
marginalised people who
have been long-standing
opponents.AstheUKprepares
to extract its full hydrocarbon
resources, swathes of the
British countryside have
become the new sacrifice
zones. It is not only activist
groups such as ‘Frack Off’
and ‘Reclaim the Power’ who
are resisting the dash for
gas. Local people from the
South East, Lancashire, and
Yorkshire are also joining the
resistance, as they realise the
destruction that fracking could
cause to their towns.
Direct action against
extractivism becomes even
morepowerfulwhensupported
by pressure from behind the
front lines. Campaigns which
target the carefully and
expensively crafted image
of fossil fuel companies are
already clocking major blows.
Creative protests from activist
groups ‘Platform’, ‘Liberate
Tate’ and ‘BP or not BP’ have
succeeded in driving out oil
company branding from such
cherished public institutions
as the Science Museum,
the Tate, and the Edinburgh
International Festival. As
the tally of divested funds
approaches $5.5 trillion,
cracks are starting to show:
the Saudi oil minister recently
advised the industry to thwart
the campaign to ‘Keep it in the
ground’ in order to shed its
‘Dark Side’ image.
The less political power the
fossil fuel industry wields,
the smoother the path to a
low-carbon world, where
environmental regeneration
can begin. Speaking at a
Carbon Trust dinner in 2015,
former Shell chairman Mark
Moody-Stuart admitted that
“18 years after major oil
companies acknowledged the
threat of climate change...the
industry has made remarkably
little progress”. Big Oil has
shown its hand. It’s time to
show ours.
