They’re great
but also terrible.
Someone give them
more work. They’re
dripping with hormones.
It’s admirable but also
terrifying. Mostly terrifying.

“The choice between sex
and academic accomplish-
ment, whilst pitiful, is no
doubt good preparation for
my inevitable career as an
investment banker. Having
written that, I think it might
be one of the saddest truths
in my life.”
“Being in a foreign country
with different customs is not
great for my dating/sex life
(am EU)”
“Everyone at imperial is
desperate => more sex for
me. Yay”
“[...] about penis size, I
would like to say that size
does matter, but not as in
“bigger is better” – on the
contrary, I would pick a
below average penis over
an enormous schlong any
day because I quite like my
internal organs the way
they are, thank you very
much.”
“I meet soooo many people
through tinder, I’ve not had
to pay for food in weeks!”
“Not happy that the age
categories stop at 28+ ...
us old people have sex too
you know”
“If you can’t win, confuse
them.”
“Filling this in as someone
who is planning on losing
their virginity soon in a
relationship is interesting
knowing that my choices
in the survey may change
greatly.”
“Hobbies got me laid. Do
hobbies to not be boring
and get with people. Touch-
ing tit is fun, people who
dont do oral are odd”
“The question about boobs
should have had a “small
boobs are great” option”
“It’s not gay if it’s in a three
way ;)”

Who’s playing safe
Condom use and
contraception
It’s great seeing everyone have
all this sex everywhere but are
people keeping safe, and how?
Though three-quarters of Imperial
students regularly use condoms,
8% of all respondents don’t use
any protection at all.
Condom use seems to be more
widespread amongst men, with
women being 8% less likely to
include condoms in their arsenal
of contraception. However, wom-
en may use alternative methods
of contraception such as the pill
(31%), the coil (8%) or an im-
plant (7%).
How do relationships affect safe
sex practices? Single people are
10% more likely to use condoms
than people in a monogamous
relationship, but best safe sex
practitioners are polyamorous
people. While 11% of polys will
not use any protection, 56% will
use condoms and another 33%
will use the pill or a coil. No pol-
ys seem to be relying on pulling
out, or the rhythm method.
If you’re unfamiliar, the rhythm
method relies on carefully track-
ing fertile days to calculate when
the probability of pregnancy. Al-
though the method can be up to
99% effective, there are several
drawbacks which include long
periods of abstinence (up to 16
days), the chance of miscalcula-
tion, and of course the lack of
any protection against STIs.
The rhythm method is imple-
mented by 3% of sexually active
female students while 10% of
women and 12% of men rely on
pulling out. This is an even less
effective tactic, as there’s often
enough sperm in the precum to
successfully fertilise an egg. Not
to mention the possibility of de-
ception and the risk of getting
an STI. Gurl – don’t you trust
nobody with your reproductive
health.
Speaking of STIs, almost
three-quarters of all sexually ac-
tive IC students have, at some
point, engaged in bareback sex
(sex without a condom). Out of
these, 42% have never been to
the sexual health clinic. These vis-
its to the clinic are more common
amongst women than men, with
55% of sexually active men hav-
ing never visited a sexual health
clinic vs. 40% of women at Impe-
rial. Women are also more likely
than men to visit the clinic regu-
larly (at least once a year) as
opposed to when they’ve hooked
up with a new partner or are wor-
ried about STI symptoms.
Your relationship to sexual health
might be related to your cultur-
al behaviours associated with
your sexuality. Straight students
are less likely to visit the sexual
health clinic than bisexual stu-
dents. Further down the Kinsey
scale, straight students are twice
as likely to avoid visiting a sexual
health clinic in comparison to gay
students, and if we crumple up
the scale and throw it in the trash,
pansexuals are four times as like-
ly to visit the sexual health clinic
as their straight counterparts.
Along similar lines homosexual
and pansexual students are much
more likely to regularly visit the
clinic as part of their annual (or
more frequent) routine.
Sexual health
checks
Sexually
transmitted
infections
Though most students seem to be
aware of the existence of most
common STIs, 5% of respondents
claim to be unfamiliar with HIV,
herpes and gonorrhoea, while
10% are not aware of HPV, syph-
ilis and chlamydia. Only one-in-
three respondents were familiar
with shigella (which admittedly is
niche – it causes dysentery).
HIV and PReP
Pre Exposure Prophylaxis, or
PrEP, has been in the news a lot
over the years. Most recently it
made headlines when Scotland
made it available on the NHS.
PrEP refers to an antiretroviral
medication – usually Truvada
– which is taken preventatively
to reduce the risk of HIV trans-
mission, which studies suggest it
does successfully by 80%.
In the UK (with the exception of
Scotland as of last month), Tru-
vada is only free if it’s part of
emergency PEP. PEP (Post Expo-
sure Prophylaxis) is given in case
of potential transmission. This
might include accidental pricking
with an infected syringe (particu-
larly common amongst health
professionals) or a sexual en-
counter of high risk (particularly
common amongst men seeking
men). Getting it pre-emptively as
part of PrEP at the moment re-
quires shelling out £400 a month.
So what’s the relationship of Im-
perial students with PrEP? Of all
respondents, less than a quarter
were familiar with the drugs, with
2% having heard of PEP and 3%
having heard of PrEP. Women
were perhaps surprisingly more
likely to have heard of the two
treatments. Queer students how-
ever were the likeliest to know of
PEP and PrEP and amongst them,
students that were familiar with
one of the treatments were famil-
iar with the other one too. 1.5%
of respondents have taken PEP
and 0.8% are currently on PrEP.
Things you
thought we
missed
“Everyone likes a spoon”
“Knifeplay, orgasm denial,
domsub stuff (not bondage
related, but I guess sort of
roleplay? Still feels seper-
ate)”
“Dry Humping”
“Playing with my balls”
“You aren’t distinguishing
between giving and receiv-
ing e.g. oral and anal sex. I
feel like this is relevant.”
“Dildos / sex toys during
sex”
“Rimming/assplay!” x3
“Fucking James Cox. James
COCK am I right”
“A good old 69 - the best
kind of oral”
“Cuddling” x2
“Pegging, or does that
count as anal ? (I put anal)
and dirty talk”
“Food play! Whipped
cream... Nutella. Mmmm.”
“Dressing up as Mario, get-
ting her to suck on my spicy
meat-a-balls, and shouting
mamma mia when I cum”
“I enjoy rubbing my balls
on all of the rice cookers
left out in the kitchen, typi-
cally at about 5am or so.”
“if sex in gay saunas
counts, then yes. that.”
“Gunge play & armpit
fetishes”
“Regular?” x2
“69, plain old vaginal sex”
“Revising. Masturbating to
Panopto.”
“Why is the Felix centerfold
not featured as a kink???”
As for actual STIs the most com-
monly contracted disease seems
to be chlamydia, followed by her-
pes and gonorrhoea, tied with
crabs. Though at this point the
sample was relatively small so we
wouldn’t say this is indicative of
an Imperial-wide state. However,
so many people fail to check up
on their sexual health, that any-
thing might go.
