SO, HOW SEXUAL are
Imperial students? They
actually don't seem to be
scoring too badly. The vast
majority have been deflow-
ered (86%) while only 16%
remain virgins. So most Im-
perial students have – at
some point – had sex. BUT
WHEN? It turns out prime
cherry-popping time is the
ripe-old age of 18, right as
you arrive at uni! Over 25%
of all ‘virgouts’ (yes we’ll be
using this term regularly) lost
their virginity around that
mark. Still, an intact virgin-
ity seems to be most prev-
alent amongst 19-year-old
students (soz guys). In more
mature age groups, losing
one’s virginity becomes a
rarer event (partially be-
cause everyone’s already
lost it already) with 21
being some-
what of a
c u t - o f f
point.
W e
d o n ’ t
want to
freak anyone
out but if you’re
a 21-year-old virgin and
you’re dying to get some,
you may be running out of
time.
To make things even worse,
Imperial students who’ve
been here for a while are
more likely to have been
late bloomers. That might
be a result of youngsters los-
ing their virginity earlier and
earlier or maybe it just takes
a special someone to en-
dure Imperial for prolonged
periods of time.
Departments were found
to be on average between
5% virgin (go Bioeng! Sor-
ry Humanities, your sample
size was too small, and size
definitely matters) and 26%
virgin (go Computing!),
but generally sexual activ-
ity seems to be consistent
across departments.
Gay students were also
found less likely to be vir-
gins than their straight coun-
terparts (take that society!).
While 6% of gay students
are still virgins, that figure
jumps up to 15%
in straight stu-
dents, and
then to
1 6 %
in bi-
sex-
u a l s
a n d
22% in
pansexuals.
Interestingly not all
asexual students were nec-
essarily virgins demonstrat-
ing that sexual attraction
isn’t linked to the desire to
have sex – this means that
you might want to have sex
with a particular person
without necessarily having a
sex drive.

You’re more likely to

unattractive people if
you’re a virgin

INTRO | Thanks to all 817 students who took time
to fill out our annual sex survey. We tried to make
the process fun and hopefully we succeeded. May-
be. Whatever. The sex survey yielded a ridiculous
amount of data and insight into the sex lives, fanta-
sies and minds of Imperial students. Trust me when
I tell you we’ll be having statistics nightmares for
weeks.
Trying to interpret all of the data has been inter-
esting to say the least. We asked so many ques-
tions, many of which we’re willing to admit were
pretty dumb. Even the dumb questions have been
quite something to look at, though. Sadly there’s
only so much time, space and energy that we can
expend on the analysis. We’ve picked some of
the highlights and answered some of the burn-
ing questions the student body has traditionally
had. You might notice the omission of some data
points. For example there are instances when we
don’t touch upon specifics of asexuals, aroman-
tics, or business school students. This is due to the
relatively low representation of these groups we
had at times that made us uncomfortable with
reporting on and making generalisations about
the behaviour of minority groups (looking at you
business school students).
But, without further ado, here they are: the
2017 felix sex survey results. Read on, enjoy and
take everything with a pinch of salt. This is not a
scientific paper. It’s barely a Cosmo article.
