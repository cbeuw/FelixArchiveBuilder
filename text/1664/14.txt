S
ex and Puppets
is reimagining
the way we talk
about sex. A
production by the
puppet company
Wondering Hands uses a
series of witty sketches –
composed from verbatim
transcripts of real life
experiences – to explore
different aspects of sex.
It is directed by Edie
Edmundson, who I inter-
viewed last year for felix
when she was the lead
puppeteer in the Little Match
Girl at The Globe. Edie hopes
the show will help address
the lack of proper sexual
education given by the UK
school system. She believes
puppets help to make a sub-
ject that is often obscured by
at the front were only a few
metres away the puppets
and the puppeteers, which
allowed a good deal of audi-
ence interaction.
In the opening sketch, Fuzz,
who looks a bit like a cross
between a golden retriever
and a pink Muppet, pesters
the front row to allow him
to access 18+ material on
his tablet. When he is finally
granted access, he grunts and
reclines, proceeding to enjoy
the material with help of an
aubergine.
Some of the most effective
parts are when the puppets
acknowledge their puppet-
eers; in one sketch, after
declaring some bold sexual
fantasy, they turn to question
their operators, who become
comically shy and awkward.
Through methods like these
the puppets are allowed to
grow as characters away
from their puppeteers,
becoming detached from the
humans on stage and taking
on rich personas of their own.
The show was funny, inform-
ative, and, visually, a delight.
My favourite sketches were
given by the puppets acting
as STIs, including chlamydia,
crabs, and genital warts.
Someone at Wondering
Hands has serious creative
talent – these puppets were
very skilfully designed; I've
never seen crabs look so cute
or genital warts so grumpy!
I was also surprised at how
effective the puppets were
at giving medical advice,
as a microbiologist, it was
heartening to see accurate
information being dissemi-
nated in such a fun way.
Reflecting on the whole
performance, it is clear that
Wondering Hands are doing
something highly commenda-
ble. Puppetry is an excellent
medium to discuss sexual
issues. The way we associate
puppets with childhood
means that it catches us
unawares to hear puppets
discussing topics on adult
themes. We don't bring our
guard up in the same way
that we might be inclined to
when a serious looking pro-
fessional gives us information
on the same topics. With the
awkwardness out of the way,
it's easier to engage with

analogy or misrepresented in
pornography, to be honestly
talked about in way that is
accessible.
I have first hand experience
with the lack of useful sex
education in schools, having
attended a faith school that
believed repeating "don't
have sex before marriage"
would adequately cover all
the nuances of sexual educa-
tion. It was, therefore, with
considerable anticipation that
I sat crammed in People's The-
atre in Camden last Sunday,
where the show would be on
for one night only as part of
the hotbed festival of sex.
I am happy to report that
it did not disappoint. The
performance was confident,
well-choreographed, and
delicately handled a range
of issues, from first kisses, to
some rather unusual sexual
kinks. Most importantly, it was
also really funny.
The venue perfectly suited
the tone of the show. It was
intimate and relaxed. Those
what is actually being said.
Edie hopes that in the near
future she might be able to
tailor a more child-friendly
version of the show to be
performed in schools. She
tells me that they have lots of
sketches stored up, so it's just
a matter of choosing the best
ones to perform.
The run may be over in
Camden but there's another
opportunity coming up soon;
the next performance will be
at Brainchild and Shambala
Festival this summer, and
there are plans to tour the
UK later this year. I urge all
of you to seek out this show.
There'd a lot to learn from
Sex and Puppets.
