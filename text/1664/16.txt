This week you’re
that one person who
claims to have had sex
on Queen’s Lawn. No
one believes you even
though it’s true. You
decide to repeat the
deed and Facebook
live it.

This week you
realise your partner
thinks thinking of
cheating counts as
cheating. You’re
dating the thought
police.
This week after
reading felix you
decide to never, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever let anyone go
near your genitals.
This week you’re Rob
Garside and you’re
drunkenly harassing
the felix team on print
day. You are no friend
of the cat.
This week you’re
dodgy, you’re making
bold claims and you’re
causing people to raise
an eyebrow. You’re the
Sex Survey statistics.
This week you realise
those daily monsters
are catching up with
you. Those heart
palpitations aren’t
going away.
This week you’re wet AF.
You’re the fucking weather.
This week you’re
that cheddar, brie and
marmalade panini that
occasionally appears
around campus. You’re
possibly the best thing
to have even been
offered in an IC cafe.
This week you get
announced but no one
had the tiniest clue
who you are. You’re
the Summer Ball’s
headliners.
This week you’re
UCL and you decide
to take competing with
Imperial to a whole
other level. You leak
an exam AND force
students to resit it.
Fuck you Imperial.
#realnews
This week you’re gagging
to read the Sex Survey.
After reading it you decide
to give gagging a try.
This week you decide
to be the first Imperial
student to try getting
laid in a Union minibus.
You scratch your dick
in the process and get
tetanus and die. But
you will go down in
history.

Dear Chris,
I just read the sex survey analysis and apparently if I don’t
get laid by the age of 21 I’m fucked (metaphorically sadly).
Also apparently I’ve already missed on the 18s Fuckfest
where/when everyone pops their cherry.
I’m freaking out dude. I don’t want to die a virgin. Help?
Best,
Pew R
Dear Pew,
Deep breaths. Breathe in, breathe out,
breathe in, breathe out. It’s fine. You’ll lose
your virginity probably. If you really want to.
First off, let’s tackle this incredulous rumour
according to which if you don’t lose your
virginity by the age of 21 you’ll keep it forever.
It’s my understanding that the origin of this
rumour is a stupid felix survey (this is all news
to me)? If there’s one thing I’ve learned while
writing for this rag it’s not to believe anything
in it.
Personally as a semi-scientist I like seeing
things like p-values, standard errors and
deviations, exact sample sizes and all that. If
there was none of that in the survey analysis
I wouldn’t take any ‘results’ at face value.
Having said that I am a sucker for fancy
HOROSCOPES
graphics so don’t take anything I say at face
value either.
Secondly, there’s always a way. I’m sure that
all you need to do is relax, be yourself (maybe
lower your standards a bit/a lot) and just you
know, wait for the right moment.
Losing your virginity is nothing special. It’s
mostly a bit awkward and lame. If you ask me
the virgins are the lucky ones; they’ve never
had to know the awkward fumbling and com-
pulsive crying that almost always go hand in
hand with the loss of one’s virginity.
So maybe just be happy with what you’ve
got instead and don’t be an ungrateful dick.
Appreciate your purity, may it last forever.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
