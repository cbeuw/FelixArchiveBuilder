ow, I hate to rattle
off this antiquated
diatribe, but when
it comes to sex I’m
a man of scripture:
it’s Adam and
Eve, not Adam and Steve. Your
butthole is an exit path rather
than an alternative shortcut. To be
quite honest, I hate to discuss this
concept as mere mention of Adam
and Steve makes me feel as though
I’m about to puke up my guts. I
mean two wieners should be kept
five metres away from one another
at all times. In fact I am currently
developing a penis repellent
system involving magnets so that
if any of the gays get too frisky
they will be unable to get through
the magnetic field. I don’t really
understand magnets or physics
to be entirely honest with you
but hopefully this system will be
fool-proof. If there are any known
homosexuals currently reading this
column I want to make an appeal
to them to please just try to be
normal – how can you know that
you don’t like diddling your fiddles
in lady parts if you constantly
spend your days putting them
places where the sun don’t shine?
All this chat about bumholes has
taken me back. I remember losing
my virginity – such a great coming
of age moment it was. Of course
I don’t count that incident that
occurred at camp with my cousin
really, as it was experimental more
than anything, and after several
sessions at conversion therapy
Brian is finally cured.
When I lost my purity to the
carnal pleasures of this world
it was a bleak and sullen day;
it had been raining for weeks,
but the rain had let up. It was
around Christmas and my then
girlfriend had come over for the
family’s annual party. After several
eggnogs we went upstairs and
well, one thing led to another,
she passed out, and then I ended
up having sex with my aunt (no
relation). In many ways I think that
day shaped me and informed my
entire outlook upon the world. I
also developed a taste for oddly
masculine looking women with
maternal instincts but I think it’s
probably for the best not to delve
too deep into that.
I’m sure you all know that
sexuality is something that should
be worn on your chest like large
D-cup breasts, and it is something
that you should never be ashamed
of. Except if you are queer,
lesbian, interracial, an ethnic,
into watersports, or own leather
trousers. Also keep it in your fuck-
ing house. And keep your curtains
drawn. Thanks.
N
ow, I know I have
spent many of
these columns over
the past year or
so talking about
my proclivity for
‘inappropriate’ relations with
creatures of the animal persuasion,
and although I hate to beat a
dead horse (although that does
sound pretty sexy), I may mention
it again at some point. Perhaps.
Probably. As you may be aware,
since no-one else in the felix team
had the opportunity to write
anything this week, the issue is just
about as thin as my tolerance for
misgendering dogs and cats (those
sexy gender-neutral cuties). So
you might have noticed that a lot
of effort has gone into creating a
pull out section analysing the sex
survey results, which is ironic since
I know for a fact that the editor of
the paper never pulls out.
I imagine like every year there
will be numerous reports of
porking in different places around
campus, which is funny because
I am always around handing out
leaflets about identifying those
who do experiments on animals
but no-one seems to ask me if
I want to join in. Luckily I carry
around a hedgehog in my back-
pack just in case I get cold and
lonely.
On a side-note, I recently started
trying this new thing to attract
the ladies where I spray myself
with horse piss (the jury’s out on
whether’s that’s vegan). I’m hoping
the natural musky pheromones will
attract the females towards me on
a purely biological level. As of the
time of writing there are no inter-
ested parties but I’m sure that will
start to change soon enough.
Since I am currently experiencing
a period of transient abstinence
and a remarkable deficiency of
animals, I have had to turn to syn-
thetic ways of getting my almond
nuts off.
In the days before I was turned
by the great peachy light of
veganism, I did have a... how do
you describe it.... masturbatory
aid, (also known as a flesh light)
although it was made of planet
destroying plastics. In recent years,
thanks to advances in modern
science, we have been able to
upcycle materials to create these
aids and I have since started using
one again! It is amazing what you
can produce using just soya bean
proteins and almond butter to get
tingles all over your chi.
Also don’t forget to register to
vote in the next few days, and per-
haps maybe, just maybe, we will
finally have a Prime Minister who
doesn’t understand economics.
Also Theresa May looks like she
needs to masturbate. Jeez Louise.
Veganism is changing
the way we eat but it’s
about to change the
way we have sex
Jonathan Masters’ got pee’d on
by a horse to attract mates and
set the tone of their column
Sex is natural,
unless it’s not in
which case keep it
in your pants please
Monathan Jasters fondly talks
about the day he lost his virginity
(and also rants against gays)
