Whatisnews?
I
n fact let’s go deeper. What is a newspaper? If
it’s a publication propelled by the propagation of
news to its readers, then let me tell you you’re in
for a treat because this is the newsiest, newspaper
we’ve ever made. I’m obviously referring to the
twelve page (centrefold included) sex survey
pullout. I’m going to go out on a limb and say this is the
biggest ever sex survey analysis this paper has ever
seen (I could check but I’m not that good a journalist).
What did you get last year? Four pages (probably,
again I could check but I won’t)? Well this time you get
more than double that. And this is technically all news
because it’s the first time we’re sharing any of this data
with anyone. You’re all welcome.
I’m keeping it short and sweet. Partially because all
my editors are dead or dying under piles of books,
notes, stationery and candy-wrappers which means
I’m running around the office like a headless chicken
trying to make sure everything is ready. Mostly
because there’s only four more issues of felix left and
I’m already sooooo over it.
I’m kidding! I love it! I love you! : | So yeah I’m
out. Hopefully there won’t be quite as many typos in
this edition. But obviously at this point nothing really
matters. Enjoy the sex. Or reading about it. Also
happy birthday Clive.
