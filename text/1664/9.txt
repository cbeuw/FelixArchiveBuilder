What is
cheating even?
Like, for real.
THE ULTIMATE QUESTION: did
they cheat on me (followed by
the lesser-known question: did
I cheat on them?). Well here’s
what you guys think: most peo-
ple agree that if anything physi-
cal happens, it’s cheating. Short
of that, you’re largely OK. And
if you’re drunk? You’re less likely
to be judged as a cheat. Not by
much though – you can’t blame
everything on your lack of inhi-
bitions.
So how widespread is cheating
at geek central? Surprisingly
perhaps, only 19% of people
have cheated on a partner –
way below the national average
of 41%.
These figures were pretty much
consistent regardless of gender
or sexuality so if you could stop
assuming bi people are more
likely to cheat that’d be great,
thanks. Interestingly enough,
those aged 26 and over were
much more likely to have cheat-
ed on a partner, including a
staggering 80% of 27-year-olds.
To the 6% of you that queried
whether it’s really cheating if no
one knows: yes. Yes it is.
Most cheaters were found out
at some point – largely because
they confessed. Women and bi-
sexuals were the most likely to
confess (46% and 53%) where-
as two-thirds of both non-binary
people and pansexuals would
never tell.
When you look at each depart-
ment, Civil Engineering and Ma-
terials students were the most
susceptible to guilt: 100% con-
fessed to their partner. Chemical
Engineering students were much
more likely to manage to keep
their dirty little secret – 100%
were prepared to take it to their
grave.
In most cases, cheating didn’t
end our respondents’ relation-
ships – at least not permanently.
This was largely because their
partner didn’t find out. Those
most likely to break up perma-
nently were the unlucky few that
got caught in the act. Confessing
didn’t seem to do anybody many
favours – 49.23% lost their rela-
tionship as a result of admitting
their transgression. So much for
open and direct communication.
If you want to be honest but still
want to keep your relationship,
your best bet is to let your part-
ner find out either from some-
body else (62.5%) or social me-
dia (57.14%).
Pleasingly, I guess, most people
have never been cheated on (at
least not knowingly).
Amongst those unfortunate
enough to have found out that
they had been the victim of
cheating, 58% ended the rela-
tionship afterwards. A further
11% initially ended the relation-
ship but then decided to get back
together later. Is this a result of
low esteem? You deserve better
babez.
Imperial students are evidently a
very forgiving bunch. Half of you
didn’t break up with a cheating
partner (though this may have
been because you didn’t realise
you were being cheated on). Of
those of you that did end your
relationship, 9% later got back
together. Hopefully following a
period of reform on the part of
the cheater.
Apparently, older generations
struggle with fidelity: 26+ year-
olds were much more likely to
have been cheated on, with
60% of 27-year-olds reporting
they’d had a cheating partner at
some point.
Then again, being cheated on
might just be a right of passage,
a statistical necessity. How long
can you go through life without
being cheated on, really?

IT MIGHT BE THE PLEASURE, it
might be that deal the Union has
on Thursdays (you know, that
Buy-One-Get-One-Half-Price-on-
all-12”-pizzas deal) but it turns
out Imperial student prefer to be
in pairs.
Of those surveyed, 66% are cur-
rently in some form of relationship
(parasitic or symbiotic, we cannot
tell). Of these, the majority are in
committed monogamous relation-
ships with mostly younger people
opting for casual relationships.
So what does a monoga-
mous couple do apart
from being all lovey-
dovey, ruining
ever ybody’s
lunch? Well
a p p a r e n t -
ly those
who get
themselves
paired up
watch porn
a lot, more
than any oth-
er group (al-
though single
people were a
close second).
If you’re not in a monogamous
relationship prepare to hate all
your friends who are. People in
them report being much more
likely to be able to enact their
sexual fantasies, think they’re hot
(or at least somewhere between
average and irresistible in terms
of looks), and are happy or very
happy with their sex lives.
On the other side of the spectrum,
of the 30% of single students,
the vast majority weren’t happy
about it. If you want to change
that, your best bet for a hook-up
is probably a Computing student
– 51% of them told us they were
single and ready to mingle.
But wait, there’s more. 57% of
monogamous relationships and
60% of polyamorous relation-
ships were with other Imperial
students. More than half of un-
dergrads and Masters students
were in relationships with fellow
students. We can only assume
postgrads have had the luxury of
seeing a world outside of South
Ken. Those with casual friends
with benefits overwhelmingly
found partners outside of Imperi-
al. 37% of you would rather die
than date anyone from Imperial.
It’s okay, we’re not taking it per-
sonally. Much.
K. You’re in a relationship. We
get it. Your relationship is much
likelier to be super fresh
(between one and six
months) or long-term
(something between
one and two years).
It looks like not
that many people
make it through
the uncanny val-
ley of relation-
ships and out to
the one-year anni-
versary.
Worse still, those who
do survive the one-year
probation period and who
are officially in long-term rela-
tionships are much more likely
to watch porn; 75% of people
in one--to-two-year-long relation-
ships claimed they needed porn
to masturbate/function. Unsur-
prisingly, older respondents were
the most likely to have been in
relationships for more than two
years, though most of the young-
est students had still been in a
relationship for at least a month.

But what about luuuuuuuuuuuv?
The vast majority of respondents
reported being in love (particu-
larly older respondents), with
most, falling in love some time af-
ter the three month mark of their
relationship. For those who asked
“What is love?”, Haddaway pro-
vided a comprehensive answer in
1993. Go do some reading.
