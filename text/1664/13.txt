Who’s boning where

IT’S TIME for the most antic-
ipated section of our annual
sex survey. How much of
campus is covered in bodily
fluids? Let’s start with mas-
turbation: over a quarter
of you admitted to having
polishing the pearl on cam-
pus. Queer students are
overall more likely to have
touched themselves on cam-
pus than their straight coun-
terparts with gay students
taking home the uni-spank-
bank award – 33% admit
to going manual on college
grounds. When it comes to
gender, Men are more likely
than women to sneak out of
a lecture for a cheeky wank
but it’s the non-binaries that
win this one with over a third
of them confiding in us that
they’ve masturbated on
campus. Those with a friend
with benefits are also most
likely to have flicked
the bean during
lunch-break in
com par ison
to students in
other types
of arrange-
m e n t s .
Those with
s e v e r a l
friends with
b e n e f i t s ,
though, are
the least likely
of all relationship
groups to masturbate on
campus (suggesting they al-
ready have their hands full).

WHAT ABOUT doing the ac-
tual sex? Just under a quar-
ter of you have boned on
campus. There’s no real dif-
ference between male and
female students but non-bi-
naries clearly know what’s
up, with half of
them reporting
getting down
and dirty in
that emp-
ty lecture
t h e a -
tre that
no one
k n o w s
about.
More into
their public
sexcapades
are pansexuals
(43%), followed by
bisexuals (30%), homosex-
uals 27%) and last but not
least heterosexuals (21%).
You’re also more likely to
have boned on campus if
you’re poly and less likely
if you’re single and ready
to mingle (though the sin-
gles who’d like to stay sin-
gle have reported higher
numbers of on-campus bon-
ing – maybe it’s traumatic
library sex that’s put them
off the sex in general). What
about physical appearance?
Doesn’t really matter –
everyone seems to be doing
it regardless of perceived
physical hotness.
So a quarter of you do it
in South Ken and beyond.
The most popular boning
space amongst exhibitionists
is the Union Building with a
quarter of everyone who’s
boned in public, having
boned in the Union Building
at some point ! Wooh! Are
those Kendo classes really
just a front for group sex?
Maybe, though it’s more
likely a side-effect of ACC.
Other popular destinations
include SAF, Blackett and
Princes Gardens (risqué).
Shockingly perhaps, some-
one claimed to have had
sex on Queen’s Lawn. To
you sir/madam/other, I take
my hat off. Somehow the
Bessemer building and the
Union minibuses have re-
mained untouched. Let’s not
do something about that for
next year’s survey please.
The most adventurous stu-
dents seem to come from
the department of Chemis-
try, with Chemists having
successfully planted their
flag in eight College areas
including Bone building, the
Faculty building, the Cen-
tral Library and most Un-
ion spaces. Congratulations
Chemists, you’re clearly
fearless. The least adventur-
ous of the exhibitionists have
proved to be Computing
and Earth Science students
who’ve only scored in their
home building and the Un-
ion.

FUN FACT
Only a chemist and
an engineer have
boned in the Faculty
Building. Was it with
each other?
