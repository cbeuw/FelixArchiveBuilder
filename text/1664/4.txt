UCL leaks paper, finds out after exam
Students get 18 days to prepare for a resit

urns out Imperial
isn’t the only London
uni to routinely fuck
up exams, neither
is it the worst at it.
Last week at UCL a
mechanical engineering exam
had to be rescheduled after
the department realised it had
accidentally leaked the paper.
Students were contacted by
their department a day after
sitting their thermofluids exam
and were notified that they’d
have to do a resit later in the
month.
In an apologetic statement
sent out by the department
on behalf of Prof. Alistair
Greig, department deputy
head, students were told that
there had been “a breach of
security”. The department
informed students that the
contents of the paper had
been inadvertently shared
on Moodle and as a result
“following consultation with
the Faculty of Engineering
Sciences, UCL Examinations
Section and UCL Registrar,
it has been decided that the
examination for this paper will
be rescheduled. All students
who were expected to sit the
MECH203P exam yesterday
will be expected to sit the
rescheduled exam”
Moodle is a learning
platform designed to facilitate
sharing and is broadly used by
several education institutions,
very much like blackboard.
Companies and institutions
that use Moodle include hell,
London School of Economics,
State University of New York,
Microsoft and the Open
University.
Naturally students are less
than pleased. One mechanical
engineering student in their
second year who would
prefer to stay anonymous told
felix that many students “are
furious about the decision”.
The student explains that the
professor responsible for the
leak released a mock exam
paper onto moodle as a word
file which meant that students
could view the file’s editing
history. “It turns out, he simply
edited the actual exam paper
to make the mock paper. This
meant that it was theoretically
possible for us to have viewed
the exam paper before the
exam.”
“Most people were not even
aware that we could access
the file’s edit history. It was
only after the exam that on
our Mechanical Engineering
Whatsapp groupchat , it was
revealed that someone had
discovered this.”
The students have been
given 18 days notice to once
again revise for the subject.
For many this resit will be on
top of up to eight exams that
May is already packed with.
The department claims to be
trying to prevent clashes with
other projects on the affected
students’ timetables however
communications so far don’t’
seem to have addressed
concerns about wellbeing and
academic performance
This has prompted students
to accuse UCL of having “no
empathy for their students…
scrambling to contain this
disaster” instead, feeling
that their university is being
“run as a corporation, rather
than an inclusive educational
institution”. We have contacted
UCL for comment but have not
yet received a reply.

T
he Union is moving
towards taking a
stronger stance
on Freedom of
Speech. Over the
past few months
a conversation has begun
around the role of Imperial
College Union in supporting
students’ freedom of speech.
The question of “Are we doing
enough to promote dialogue
and debate?” lies at the centre
of this move.
Union officials are
recognising that Imperial can
be a place of contradictions.
College and the Union don’t
exactly have a history of
engaging in many practices
associated with the ‘politically
correct’ left. These include
trigger warnings, no-
platforming and boycotting.
These policies are often
attacked by alt-right personas
as restrictive of free speech.
Yet at the same time the safe
space policy and the external
speakers policy (which
requires the Union to vet
external speakers) could be
seen as restrictive of students’
freedom of expression.
Similarly Imperial prides
itself in the involvement of
its students and staff and the
Union has the highest numbers
of clubs and societies of all UK
Universities. Yet campaigns
rarely take off and when they
do, they don’t necessarily get
as much support as they could
or should.
Whether this is a result
of the type of people that
populate Imperial or an effect
of Imperial’s institutional
culture of silence is up for
debate. However just as
there’s a strong push for
student involvement in clubs
and societies, whether that’s
through sport participation or
involvement with the arts, the
feeling in ICU seems to be that
there should be a similar push
in forming educated, socially
aware citizens, capable of
debate and if necessary
action.
Within the next year we
should be seeing a full
restructuring of campaign
management at the Union,
though changes in the way
campaigns are supported and
the resources available for
them are already underway.
