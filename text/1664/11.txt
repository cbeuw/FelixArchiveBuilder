Who’s thinking what
Clitoris, female
G-spot, vagina
and boobs
Who values the clitoris most?
70% of international (non-EU)
students thought that clitoral stim-
ulation was important compared
to 62% of home students and
52% of EU students. But it seems
that Europeans may be the most
generous lovers because an addi-
tional 36% of them thought that it
wasn’t sex if it didn’t involve the
clitoris, while only 12% of in-
ternational students had
this opinion. Whether
Brexit will affect the
clitoral stimulation
of millions of
women in the
UK remains to
be seen, but
we are willing
to send our
data to the
Home Office if
there’s a chance
it will make a dif-
ference.
What about the female
G-spot? Turns out, more
women than men think the female
G-spot is a myth (13% compared
to 8%). Worse still perhaps, 10%
of men and 12% of women think
it’s the clitoris (nope) and 8% of
men and 2% of women think it’s
the prostate (again, nope). Ba-
sically, you all need a diagram,
apart from those who identified
as non-binary, of whom 54%
said they knew exactly where it
was and how to find it. Only 28%
of women and men on the other
hand had the courage to make
such a bold claim.
“I like ‘em tight.” Seriously, who
says that? Apparently 19% of
men but thankfully only 3% of
women. No non-binary people
share the sentiment suggesting
once again they might be ahead
of the curve. Still on the topic of
vaginas, 80% of women think va-
ginas are all different, but 13%
think they’re all the same.
The prostate
and the penis
Moving on to the main attractions
of the male anatomy, 45% of
gay men and women think that
the prostate is great, and 9% be-
lieve it needs to be stimulated for
sex to be enjoyable Only 12%
of heterosexuals have a similarly
positive view of the prostate, with
only 1% admitting to a need for
prostate stimulation.
In part that may be down to the
fact that 9% of men and 18% of
women didn’t even know what
the prostate was. Mech Eng in
particular need some biology les-
sons – 26% of them don’t seem
to know what the prostate is. Life
sciences might need a curriculum
overhaul too, though, because
15% of them also don’t have a
clue.
What about dicks? Do they vary?
Do we really appreciate their
subtle differences? They way they
all bend differently? Apparent-
ly not. 74% of men and 76% of
women think that a dick is a dick
– circumcised or uncircumcised.
Although both men and women
expressed a preference for uncir-
cumcised dick on average, wom-
en are slightly more likely to opt
for an uncut penis, with 10% of
women liking them cut, and 13%
of women liking them uncut. For
men, on the other hand, the pref-
erence for foreskin is 19% with
vs. 7% without. It seems some
men are attached to their fore-
skin. Literally.
Looking at penis preference
based on fee status yields further
insight still. Although the vast ma-
jority of people really do just think
a dick is a dick, no matter which
way you look at it, both home
and EU students – if they have
a preference – prefer an uncir-
cumcised penis, and international
students overwhelmingly prefer
a circumcised penis, being more
than four times as likely to opt
for something that doesn’t look
like a naked mole rat. For those
Let’s look at a departmental
breakdown: 29% of EEE students
who answered our survey say that
they like their vaginas tight, with
24% of Materials students not far
behind, also finding a tight vagi-
na high on their priority list. No
one in Chem Eng or the Centre
for Co-Curricular Studies (CCS)
expressed this preference for
vaginas. You’re also more likely
to prefer a tight vagina if you’re
older, with the peak percentage
with that preference found in 25
and 26-year-olds. Thankfully no
one under 18 said they liked a
tight vagina which means they’re
either still pure and inno-
cent or we’re moving
towards a society
that doesn’t rate
vaginas based
on tightness.
A m o n g s t
those in re-
lationships,
the ones
who are
most likely
to prefer a
tight vagina
are the ones
with either one,
or several friends
with benefits. Take
that as you will.
Enough about vaginas. Let’s talk
about breasts. Men are more like-
ly than women to prefer big boobs
(21% compared to 16%) but are
also less likely to think that small
boobs make them sad (3% com-
pared to 5%). Bioeng is the de-
partment with the highest number
of Big Boob Enthusiasts (BBEs),
with 32% proudly declaring that
big boobs are great. You’re most
likely to think big boobs are great
if you masturbate multiple times a
day. 45% of people who watch
Big Tits porn think that big boobs
are better. At the same time, 6%
of people who enjoy Big Tits porn
also claim that they really don’t
care much for boobs. WHO ARE
THESE PEOPLE?
who have a preference (at most
43%, which is in EEE), the only
department where an unircum-
cised penis isn’t the top choice is
in civil engineering, where 20%
of people call a circumcised dick
their preference.
Civ Eng are our size queens, with
a third of them saying that penis
size matters, and that everyone
prefers a well endowed partner.
Chemistry are quite the oppo-
site, with the highest number of
students (44%) believing that
it’s more about how you use it.
Straight people think size matters
more than gay people: 18% of
heterosexuals said that size mat-
ters, compared to 14% of bisex-
uals and 17% of homosexuals.
Sadly for all you men, women
actually care more about dick
size than men. 20% of women
say the bigger the better, where
only 16% of men and 14% of
non-binary people feel the same.
Whether you think a big dick
is important seems to vary with
age. It gets more important when
you’re in your early twenties, but
it just isn’t a priority when you’re
24-26. However as soon as you
hit 27 you realise you’re too old
for tiny dicks, and it gets back on
the top of your list.
Comparing those who think size
matters most with frequency of
masturbation shows us that if
you’re masturbating less than
once a month or multiple times
a day, you’re much more likely
to think size matters. If you’re
having sex, you’re most likely
to think that size is important if
you’re having sex 2-3 times a
week.

Who’s doing what
Spanking the
monkey
We all do it and now we have the
data to prove it. We’re obviously
talking about wanking.
It seems that with some minor ex-
ceptions, masturbation is like a
balanced diet, or a good night’s
sleep; the more you age, the
more you appreciate it. People
spank the monkey more and
more as they age. By the age of
23 only 4% don’t masturbate.
Then BAM, the mid-twenties crisis
hits, and the 24 and 25-year-olds
of Imperial are less likely to
masturbate than their
20+ equivalents.
But everything
slips back to
normal soon.
Every sin-
gle student
asked over
the age
of 25 ad-
mitted to
flipping the
dolphin.
Gold star to
Mech Eng and
Computing stu-
dents. They mastur-
bate so religiously, not even
being on campus can stop them.
44% and 37% of Mech Eng and
Computing students, respectively,
have admitted to masturbating
on campus. Bravo.
The porn of
things
What do we leave behind when
we die? Our browsing history of
course. And the most damning
element of that is our porn pref-
erences. Thanks to us, you don’t
have to wait till your bestie dies to
find out what they’re into. You can
use the magical power of stats to
make an educated guess instead.
So, what do people watch?
The most popular categories of
porn overall and the correspond-
ing percentage of respondents
who enjoy them are three-
some (45%), amateur
(40%), blowjob
(35%), bondage
(34%) and
college/frat
(33%). How-
ever, the
porn that
people are
w a t c h i n g
varies a lot
according to
their gender
identity – with
the exception
of threesome
porn which domi-
nates people’s choice
regardless of gender. For
men, the next four most-popular
genres include amateur (47%),
blowjob (42%), POV (40%), and
college/frat porn (39%). Wom-
en on the other prefer bondage
(44%), group sex (43%), double
penetration (32%), and gang-
bang/orgy/group porn (31%).
Interestingly, while 47% of wom-
en believe that the porn they
watch does not represent their
fantasies or what they expect
from sex, only 29% of men feel
the same way about the porn
they are consuming.
Women have less varied tastes in
porn than men. There were loads
of popular categories for men,
but for women it seems that most
of them are all watching the same
porn.
Everybody likes
threesomes
but...
We’ve established that when it
comes to porn, it’s all about the
threesome. Most people are jack-
ing it to threesome porn, but how
much is this reflective of their sex
lives? Well, 11% of men have had
a threesome, compared to 10%
of women, and 24% of non-bi-
nary people. That said, only 5%
of heterosexuals and 15% of bi-
sexuals have, with 39% of homo-
sexuals having had a threesome
leading the way.
For group sex, the hetero/homo
divide is even more pronounced.
2% of heterosexuals have been
involved in an orgy, but 21% of
homosexuals have (and 7% of bi-
sexuals). That means that if you’re
gay, you are ten times likelier to
end up in orgy in comparison to
a straight Imperial student. #sor-
rynotsorry
Despite this, 53% of participants
really want to try having a three-
some, and 26% of them want
to give group sex a shot. Gen-
der-wise, men are much keener
than women to try a threesome
(59% of men vs. 48% of women),
but they also have a greater ap-
petite for group sex (27% of men
vs. 23% of women).
It would appear that the 43% of
women who enjoy watching orgy
porn, would rather have it stay a
fantasy.
Threesome-craving doesn’t seem
to depend much on sexuality.
53% of heterosexuals would be
down for a threesome, compared
to 56% of bisexuals, and 54%
of homosexuals. That doesn’t ex-
tend to group sex though. Only
21% of heterosexuals would be
interested in giving it a go, but
38% of bisexuals and 49% of
homosexuals have this fantasy in
the darkest reaches of their mind.
