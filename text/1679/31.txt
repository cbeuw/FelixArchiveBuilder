A
fter taking
on several
Cross-Country
races as well
as the Brighton 10K,
ICXCAC went on to
compete at the London
Universities and Colleges
Athletics (LUCA) Indoors
Championships on the
25th
of November.
As usual, the runners
decided to meet up at Beit
before making their way
to the event. However, the
journey was rather long
so after an adventurous
trip via the London under-
ground, overground and
bus services, ICXCAC
finally reached North
London’s Lee Valley Ath-
letics Centre around noon.
As they got there, the
Imperial crew settled
down in a crowd of 276
athletes from 24 clubs,
55 of which were from
Imperial! They then had
time to get changed,
get their bibs and start
warming up as the first
events were scheduled to
begin at 13:00, and there
was no way Imperial were
missing any events: they
had the highest participa-
tion with a massive 187
individual events entered!
As the day began,
athletes made their way to
the pole vault, high jump
and 60m hurdles starting
line, ready to make the
most out of their day.
The first events proved
to everyone that Imperial
wasn’t there to spectate:
Noël Rimensberger took
3rd
in the Men’s 60m
Hurdle in 9.44s and then
3rd
again for the Men’s
High Jump with an im-
pressive 1m80, followed
closely in 4th
by Baptiste
Thebert.
The Women’s team
did an equally inspiring
performance as sisters
Viktoria and Katherina
“Imperial
took 1st
, 2nd
,
and 3rd
for
the Pole Vault
competition,
undoubtedly
leaving the
whole stadium
stunned”
their great performance
earlier, Noël and Baptiste
went on to dominate the
long and triple jump,
grabbing respectively 2nd
and 3rd
then 1st
and 3rd
for these events. Marta
Von Ginkel also managed
to reach an impressive
9.67m for her triple jump,
reaching a well-deserved
3rd
place.
After a short break
in events, what were
surely the most inspiring
and intense events were
coming up: the track
events finals. The evening
events started slightly
before 6pm with the
1500m final, where Kate
Olding smashed it and
took gold in just over 5
minutes for the Women’s
race, and on the Men’s
team fresher James Millet
did a great performance
coming in 3rd
overall
with 4:19.36, followed
closely by trail Captain
Henry Hart and Men’s
Captain Lewis Jackson,
all placing in the top 10.
Further down the line,
Alex Mundell reached
for another medal as she
took 3rd
in the Women’s
400m final. Kate Olding
then went on to win the
Women’s 800m in 2:23
while Jonathan Wong
took 2nd
– another huge
performance and keeping
Imperial very high in the
rankings.
At last, it was time
for the much anticipated
3000m finals, which
was probably the most
intense of the day: Henry
Hart took 9th
overall for
the men’s finishing in
9:53, followed closely by
Fergus Johnson in 12th
,
Kirill Mikhaylov in 13th
and Men’s Captain Lewis
Jackson, who arrived first
in the second heat. As for
the women’s race, club
captain Alex Mundell
treated us with an inspir-
ing performance, with a
huge crowd of ICXCAC
runners cheering her along
the race as she obtained a
much deserved 2nd
place
in 11:21 minutes.
The last scoring races
of the day were the
4x200m relays, where
Imperial also did brilliant-
ly by placing 3rd
in both
the Women’s and Men’s
race. Finally, the tradi-
tional mascot race took
place and this year, Mihai
Vanea wore our beloved
mascot’s costume, coming
last but definitely being
the best-looking mascot
of the day.
As the day ended, the
last medals were awarded
and results were declared;
Imperial College came 3rd
overall, only one point
behind King’s College
with UCL in 1st
place, and
had two athletes tied 2nd
as LUCA MVPs with an
impressive 8 points each:
Kate Olding and Noël
Rimensberger, so a huge
shout-out to them!
After such a successful
day, Imperial’s athletes
made their way to the
Kosk Turkish restaurant
where the mood was very
festive: the tasty meal was
accompanied by a musical
performance worthy of
Metric as the staff played
Turkish music then sang
Happy Birthday to cus-
tomers.
After the meal, the
team decided to call it a
day and made their way to
the bus station to go home,
exhausted by a long but
very successful day, full
of athletic successes and
much banter, what else
could they have asked for?
Until next time, cheerio!
