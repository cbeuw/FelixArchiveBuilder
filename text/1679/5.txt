through donations.

L
ast weekend
saw a number
of Imperial
students take
part in the Raising and
Giving (RAG) Jailbreak,
in which they aimed to
get as far away from
Imperial as possible
without spending their
own money. The most
successful team man-
aged to make it to Cape
Town, South Africa, a
total distance of more
than 9,500 km.
16 teams took part in
the event, which kicked
off on Saturday, 2nd
of De-
cember. The teams trav-
elled an average of 2,430
km, with destinations
ranging from Morocco to
Glasgow. One team only
managed to make it to
Heathrow, a total journey
of 19.4 km.
Felix spoke to two
of the teams: Brownian
Motion, who went to
Cape Town (and set the
previous record of Bali);
and John and Saaras, who
reached Istanbul:
I
mperial College
Union has started
on plans to review
how they currently
work with their Liber-
ation Officers, with the
aim of improving the
Union commits to supporting liberation officers
support available.
The Liberation Officers
– nine elected students
who each coordinate a
particular ‘Liberation
Zone’, e.g. LGBT+
Officer – have been dis-
cussing future plans with
the Union. The Union
has said that “we want
to empower students and
groups to make positive
changes to student life, to
Imperial, and the wider
world.”
The move comes fol-
lowing the deliverance of
aLiberationReport,which
was commissioned by the
Union, and completed
over the summer. The
Report – which was done
to “enable an understand-
ing of the current chal-
lenges facing [Liberation]
work, and what might
be preventing ICU from
supporting sector-leading
quality” – outlined ten key
recommendations for the
Union in the future. These
included development of
training for Liberation
Officers, and an emphasis
on staff support.
A Union representative
described the Report as
“an ambitious and sec-
tor-leading programme
for change at the Union,
touching everything from
officer training, to com-
munication strategies, to
staff recruitment.”
Staff from the Union
have since met with Lib-
eration Officers to priori-
tise the recommendations
generated. Plans have
been made for the remain-
der of this academic year,
and several have already
begun or been completed.
In a statement for Felix,
a Union representative
said that “We are pleased
to say that the Liberation
Review has shaped how
we have supported our
Officers already this year,
and we are making good
progress on our Liberation
Action Plan which guides
our work through to the
end of 2018/19.”
F: How did you make
it to your destina-
tion?
BM: We played a long
game. Instead of trying
to leave London at the
first opportunity, we
decided to commit 100%
to raising as much money
as possible during the day,
and then select a destina-
tion with the funds we’d
raised. We treated it like a
problem-solving exercise:
we optimised the amount
of money we were raising
per hour – every minute
lost felt like money lost.
We realised a lot of people
don’t really carry much
cash, so we had mobile
card readers to make con-
tactless donations super
easy.
JS: We started at 10am,
and went fundraising
around South Kensington
and Knightsbridge until
4pm. We then went back
to College and found
flights on SkyScanner to
Istanbul – we had aimed
to make it to the Greece/
Cyprus area, so this was
perfect. However, we
needed to raise some
more money, so we went
back to fundraising. We
finished at 8pm and went
straight to the airport.
F: What was the hard-
est bit of the journey?
BM: Definitely the
final two hours before
the flight departed. After
an extremely intense day
of fundraising, we quite
literally sprinted back
to Blackett, and found a
range of possible desti-
nations. Once we settled
on the flight to South
Africa, we realized it was
1 hour and 45 minutes
till the flight departed.
After spending a total of
4 minutes packing for our
journey to the other side
of the world, we dashed
to the airport in an Uber.
We weren't sure if we'd
make it to the terminal in
time, but we took the risk
and went ahead with the
tickets. Fast forward 20
minutes: we arrived at the
wrong terminal, and were
constantly trying to call
Emirates for the possibil-
ity of changing the flight.
We took our chances
again and sprinted with
our luggage for 7 minutes
straight till we arrived,
drenched in sweat, at the
customer service desk
who, after explaining that
this was a charity com-
petition, kindly opened
up the gates for us to let
to continue our mad dash
to the airplane. We didn't
know we had this much
cardio in us.
JS: The hardest part
was the time constraint
of raising enough money
before we went to the
airport and making it to
the flight.
F: What tips would
you give to others?
BM: We weren’t afraid
to try new things and be
creative – we would walk
straight into comfy 5-star
hotels and take the lift to
fundraise in the executive
lounges. People were
surprisingly OK with this.
We also took a genuine
interest in the people we
were talking to. Jailbreak
is pretty much the only
excuse you get to know the
people of London at this
scale, so trying to build a
genuine connection with
the people you’re talking
to goes a long way in per-
suading them to donate.
Our main advice would
be to really try to make
Jailbreak your own and
don't be afraid of trying
new things. If a certain
delivery isn't working,
switch it; if you're getting
tired, grab a coffee. And
be very wary of holding
false preconceptions
about what is and isn't
possible!
JS: People are really
nice and if you're confi-
dent and nice back, they
end up being really gener-
ous. The first woman we
spoke to offered us a free
bus ride to Southampton
that evening if we hadn't
managed to do any better.
Fundraising will be
completed on by Saturday,
9th
of December.
