One nation, under a meme: how 2017 was the year that
While last year Pepe the Frog was propelling orange demagogues into the White House, this year we’ve seen
memes act as a form of resistance against Trump, explore their own meanings, and bring us together in real life
to celebrate Big Shaq.
MEMES
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
I
f one wants to explore
what memes have
become in modern so-
ciety, one only needs
to explore the sad case of
Pepe the Frog. A meme
that started out in 2005 as
a form of internet humour,
mainly used across the
netherworld of 4chan,
by last year, the image
had been appropriated
by a number of alt-right
groups. Today, the Anti-
Defamation League, an
international organisation
that have historically
opposed the KKK and the
German-American Bund
of the 1930s, lists Pepe as
a general symbol of hate.
Pepe, and its associated
alt-right movement, also
did the unthinkable, and
helped propel a Wotsit-or-
ange political dilettante,
who had openly bragged
about being a sexual
predator, into the White
House. It is impossible
to say whether memes
were what determined
last year’s presidential
election, but it is certain
that memes and meme
culture will forever be
inextricably linked to the
strange turn of events of
the months leading up to
November 2016.
Memes as Resistance
If 2016 was the year
memes determined po-
litical outcomes, 2017
shows us what happens
when nihilistic internet
humour comes up against
the harsh reality of po-
litical power. Trump’s
presidency has thus far
been a veritable goldmine
for meme creators – a
sentence nobody could
have predicted being
written.
Everything about
his presidency has
memetic potential: from
#FreeMelania, which
spread after a video of
Melania Trump looking
less-than-thrilled at the
inauguration emerged,
and competed for space
with other inauguration
memes, such as Michelle
Obama doing a Jim Car-
rey-style side-look to the
camera after being handed
a gift from the new First
Lady; through to his
elaborate water break last
month during a speech
about his visit to Asia.
In some ways, the
creation of memes can
be seen as a form of
resistance against Trump,
an attempt to take him
down a peg, and remind
everyone that he really is
just an enormous joke. If
memes allowed the dem-
agogic man-child into the
Presidency, they seem to
say, memes are what will
allow us to live under his
rule. In a TIME magazine
article from May, for
example, it was revealed
that when Trump served
dessert to his guests,
“he gets two scoops of
vanilla ice cream with
his chocolate cream pie,
instead of the single scoop
for everyone else”. Such
meme fodder was quickly
picked up by the online
community, who used it
to imply that Trump has
a similar mentality to a
five-year-old child.
This function, of
memes-as-resistance, can
perhaps best be seen in
the short boom and bust
meme cycle of ‘Covfefe’:
just after midnight at
the end of May, Trump
tweeted “despite the
constant negative press
covfefe” without any ex-
Trump followed it up with
“Who can figure out the
true meaning of “covfefe”
??? Enjoy!” And just like
that, after having gained
acknowledgement from
the very person it was
supposed to be making
fun of, the meme was
dead. For Trump memes
to function, it seems
to suggest, the subject
cannot engage with them.
These are only a few
examples of what a gift
Trump’s presidency has
been for meme makers.
But what does this desire
to create humour from
his actions mean? Some
of the memes that have
been created were done so
following behaviour that
would be – in any normal
democracy – completely
abhorrent. We’ve had
Trump tossing paper
towels to victims of hur-
ricane victims in Puerto
Rico – a territory still
reeling from the disaster
while Congress discuss
tax cuts for the rich –
and Kellyanne Conway
discuss “alternative facts”
with grave seriousness,
whilst propagating lies
about fictional terrorist
attacks. You’ve got to
meme, otherwise you’ll
cry.
The Rise of Meta
Memes
Over the past few years,
memes have become
increasingly complex
and self-referential, with
some memes packing in
several layers of meaning
into a single image – like
a modern update of Eliz-
abethan portraiture. In
2017, this was perhaps
best exemplified by the
Distracted Boyfriend
meme. Based off a stock
image showing a man
turning to appreciate a
woman in a red dress,
while his appalled girl-
friend looks on, the meme
quickly took off, with

about Trump’s
presidency
has memetic
potential
for online
communities”
planation, leading some to
presume that he’d either
had a stroke or had his
phone knocked out of his
hand by an aide who has
had enough of his online
diatribes. The tweet stayed
up for around six hours,
by which time it had set
the internet alight, with
numerous parodies insert-
ing the word into scenes
from film and TV shows.
At 6:07am, however,
memes managed to bring us all together at last
“When your
friends in New
York laugh
at‘The Ting
Goes’, are they
laughing at the
same thing?”
content creators attrib-
uting various characters
and themes to the three
‘characters’ (my personal
favourite came from
Penguin Random House,
with the guy eschewing
“knowing when to use a
semicolon” for “em dash”
– far too relatable).
What set this meme
apart, however, was
the way users enabled
the meme to keep on
delivering: today, in our
constantly-online world,
the lifespan of a meme has
considerably diminished,
to the point where 24
hours can be enough for
one to run its course. What
made the Distracted Boy-
friend meme different,
however, was users dis-
covering different stock
images from the same
shoot, combining memes
together, and using the
meme itself to poke fun at
the intrinsically transient
nature of the form.
As time went on,
the layers of the meme
kept on building up, as
users created loops of
regression, flipped image
formats, and created their
own narratives. Really,
the Distracted Boyfriend
meme showed what
memes can do best: bring
people together, to create
their own stories, if only
for a short time.
Bringing us Together
This use of memes to
bring people together can
also be seen in the rise
in event-based memes
that we’ve had over the
last year. Numerous
meme-makers have been
using Facebook events
to propagate particular
memes, such as the song
‘Africa’ by Toto, or
simply to get people to say
they’re going to events
that have no purpose
in the real world. This
October, for example,
Stephanie Reid created
an event called “Windex
the Bean”, inviting
Chicago natives to clean
Anish Kapoor’s famous
sculpture Cloud Gate.
The event description
read “The Bean is dirty”.
Such events can often
spread like wildfire along
social media networks,
achieving hundreds if not
thousands of attendees.
It’s a phenomenon
some Imperial students
have experience of: just
a couple of weeks ago,
the Imperial meme page
Memeperial created an
event for “Prince Harry’s
Stag Do”, in collaboration
with a number of other
meme pages on Facebook.
At the time of writing, the
event has nearly 40,000
attendees, with more
than 100,000 interested
in attending. It reached
such prominence, that
BBC News reported on it,
which they took time to
point out was “not in any
way official”.
Paul Balaji, Imperial’s
most meme-able student,
was the one running the
event page – why did he
do it? Speaking to Felix,
he tells us “in the modern
day of social media, a
royal wedding isn’t just a
national celebration, but
rather a global phenom-
enon. Creating the event
felt like the right thing to
do – it was literally just a
bit of banter at first. The
more it grew, the more
I realised it would have
a life of its own, so I
updated the description to
reflect that it would be an
international celebration
of love.”
The Ting Goes...
Do memes really have
the power to bring us all
together? One of the most
successful memes this
year might prove that this
is the case: at the end of
August, Michael Dapaah’s
fictional rapper Big Shaq
entered Fire in the Booth,
a regular show by BBC
Radio 1Xtra DJ Charlie
Sloth. The result was a
22-minute long video
that generated countless
memes, from “man’s not
hot”, through to “2+2 is
4, minus 1 that’s 3, quick
maths” and the iconic “the
ting goes skrrrahh”.
What makes this meme
particularly interesting,
however, was the way it
broke the geographical
boundaries implicit in
its creation: Big Shaq is
an example of a piece of
comedy that is extremely
local, making cultural
references rather specific
to South London. From
roadmen refusing to take
off their jackets, to ex-
tremely poor freestyling,
everything about his Fire
in the Booth is steeped
in London culture, which
makes it popularity all the
more beguiling.
While the memes are
certainly more popular
in the UK, they have
also spread across the
world, popping up in the
United States as well. And
as much as you would
hope internet dwellers
in California are able to
understand the humour
being used by Dapaah, it’s
only too common to come
across people who don’t
understand that the whole
thing is a joke: “haha,
he’s so bad at rapping”,
you read in the YouTube
comments, as you bury
your face in your hands.
Big Shaq can, in some
ways, highlight both the
potential reach of a meme,
and its potential limita-
tions. While Stormzy’s
Gang Signs and Prayer
hit the top spot in the UK
earlier this year – and
well-deservedly – it failed
to make much of an impact
in America, showing that
even in a culture slowly
becoming more homoge-
neous, there will be local
variants forming a cultural
context in which memes
are incredibly embedded.
Your friends in New York
might be laughing along
with you as you show
them a ‘The Ting Goes’
video that cuts to footage
of Big Ben, but are they
coming from the same
point of view? Are they
laughing the same laugh?
It seems that while
memes are gradually
being thrust more and
more into the spotlight,
they throw up more
questions than answers. I
look forward to the time
in the near future when a
new generation of cultural
theorists will embrace
this new method of com-
munication, exploring
the meaning behind the
meme – who will be the
Margaret Mead of the
meme generation? Maybe
you and me.
