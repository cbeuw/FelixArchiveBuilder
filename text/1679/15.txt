Literature should not just be about ‘dead white men’
Following a Cambridge University English student’s call to ‘decolonise’ the English Literature syllabus to include
more BAME writers, Books Editor Jingjie Cheng gives her take on the issue.

M
uch has been
written so far
about ‘decol-
onising’ the
English Literature cur-
riculum, after Cambridge
University’s English un-
dergraduate Lola Olufemi
wrote an open letter
imploring her faculty to
broaden their curriculum
to include non-white
writers. The letter, signed
by around 150 students,
called on the university
to “meaningfully incor-
porate” non-white authors
and postcolonial thought
into the curriculum, rather
than having it as an “af-
terthought” in the form of
an optional paper in their
final year.
The Daily Telegraph
picked up on this story
and claimed that Olufemi
was trying to “replace”
white writers with black
ones, leading to a barrage
of social media abuse
directed at her. That a
simple call to diversify
one’s reading list was
painted as an attempt to
eliminate white men is
emblematic of precisely
the very problem that
Olufemi is trying to
address.
Literature is meant to
capture a shared humanity.
It describes the human ex-
perience in all its myriad
forms – a collective
cultural baggage that we
all shoulder together. A
curriculum comprising
only of privileged, white
male writers narrows
one’s study of literature
and the human experience
severely, shaping a paro-
chial view of the world. If
anything, the study of Lit-
erature is the best vehicle
to challenge one’s precon-
ceived ideas and make one
more open-minded – this
should be part of its aim.
After all, reading allows
one to inhabit someone
else’s life, in another
time, culture, and place,
generating empathy and
allowing a richer appreci-
ation of life.
However, I would
like to distinguish here
between simply ‘diversi-
fying’ the curriculum and
putting more focus on
postcolonial writing. Post-
colonial writing is not all
of this diversification: it
specifically involves ideas
of reclaiming voice, of
speaking out and speaking
back to those traditionally
in power, and of telling
one’s own narrative in
one’s own voice, rather
than that of the coloniser.
There is value, however,
in diversifying curriculum
by including writing from
cultures and experiences
that are not our own, even
if they are not postcolonial
in nature.
Of course, when one
studies English Literature,
one expects to learn texts
from the English canon,
and I can understand why
translated works are not
included – they would be
included in the literary
studies of their respec-
tive languages. There
is limited time within a
curriculum to teach all
the good literature that is
out there. Thus, curating
the curriculum becomes
all the more important.
While classic white male
English writers should
never be removed from
the curriculum, there
should perhaps still be
space for writers from
different backgrounds.
Olufemi is right in in-
sisting that “postcolonial
writing is not an after-
thought, it is English Lit-
erature” – unlike simply
reading from different
cultures, postcolonial lit-
erature itself is entwined
with English history, and
thus should be part of
the English canon. The
process of colonisation,
and the bloodshed,
evangelism, and cultural
mixing and clashing that
followed, bring together
two peoples, the coloniser
and the colonised, and
there is no extracting one
from this shared history.
The exclusion of postco-
lonial literature from the
main English curriculum
is a blatant denial that this
shared history exists.
Interestingly, The
Guardian’s suggested
list of BAME writers to
pick up did not include a
single East Asian writer.
It is a trend I have noticed
in BAME advocacy and
especially in the study of
Literature. It appears to
me that East Asian writers
that write in English tend
to be seen as more ‘white’
– think of Man Booker
Prize-winning and now
Nobel Literature laureate
Kazuo Ishiguro. His
books are widely read,
but mostly speak from the
English tradition – not sur-
prisingly, since he grew up
in the UK. However, even
when we consider Haruki
Murakami, who writes in
his native Japanese and
whose translated works
are popular in the West,
little is said about reading
him as a form of BAME
resistance. This is despite
the fact that his stories do
stem from an East Asian
tradition, and carry with it
its own cultural concepts.
Perhaps this is because
many East Asian ter-
ritories have not been
colonised by the West,
and there is not so much
a ‘decolonisation’ to write
about than a simple diver-
sification and broadening
of horizons to be done.
Southeast Asia, however,
has a history of being
colonised by the West,
and has its own body of
postcolonial literature as
well. Why are these works
not included in BAME
Literature lists?
It is my opinion that
postcolonial thought
should also be extended to
include other alternative
voices, such as feminist
and LGBT+ writing.
Postcolonial theory can be
applied to any community
whose voices are or once
were suppressed, but who
then develop a body of
work that tell their stories
in their own voices. This
is why works like Jackie
Kay’s Trumpet, which
tells the story of a black
man originally born a
woman, written in the
most beautiful prose, are
so important in represent-
ing the human experience
in the diversity that it is.
Literature, as a vehicle
for diverse experiences
that represent a shared
human experience, should
not be confined to the
voice of any one com-
munity. Humanity pro-
gresses, and the study of
literature, that represents
humanity, should move
with the times as well.
