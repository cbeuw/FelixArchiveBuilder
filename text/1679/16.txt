Fuck doing a top ten, I can wholeheartedly assure you that these seven albums are all you need for this year - and
no, Taylor Swift did not make the list.

Sleep Well Beast
The National
An album that’s nothing
less than a return to form
for the band. The National
are a well-known New
York-based post-rock
band (up Interpol’s alley),
known best for their
two magnificent albums
Crocodile and Boxer. So
the story goes, a group of
friends from Ohio moved
to New York for careers
in advertising, said “fuck
this” after a decade or
so, and so the band was
born. The ballads are mid-
dle-class and melancholy,
elegant and suave yet con-
fessional, and presented
with sincerity. This album
pairs nicely with good
wine.

Drunk
Thundercat
Known for his collabo-
rations with Flying Lotus
and Kamasi Washington,
and his stint as bassist
of Suicidal Tendencies,
Thundercat attained rec-
ognition after featuring on
Kendrick Lamar’s seminal
To Pimp a Butterfly.
With a delightful sense
of humor and a mind-melt-
ing sense of funk, Drunk is
the breakthrough album to
end breakthrough albums.
For those who might
need extra convincing,
evidence of his virtuosity
is readily apparent in
a fantastic Tiny Desk
Concert for NPR. All
aboard the Thundercat
hype train, my dudes.

Mr. Finish Line
Vulfpeck
It seems Vulfpeck,
the apparent musician’s
musicians, can do no
wrong. This latest effort
is a festival of funk,
featuring one of the
best bassists working
today and a collection
of multi-instrumentalist
virtuosos. The group
met at the University of
Michigan’s music school,
and has been steadily
building steam since their
2011 debut. Always tight,
always going somewhere
wonky, and always clearly
delighting in the music
they’re making, Vulfpeck
put up a strong showing
with Mr. Finish Line.
Wonderful sounds and
rhythms abound - give it
a spin.

Elektrak
Shobaleader One
Readers may know
Squarepusher for a drum
and bass career that spans
back to the mid-90s. The
London-based electronic
artist is not limited to
electronica, however.
This album features what
feels very much like a jazz
fusion quartet playing his
compositions. And man
do they nail it. Cop E8
Boogie - one of the most
satisfying bass licks (per-
formed by Squarepusher
himself) I’ve ever had the
pleasure of listening to.
This album (recorded live
in concert), to pardon the
pun, hits every note for
me.

A Crow Looked At Me
Mount Eerie
This album is a wonder-
ful, but incredibly painful
listen. Singer-songwriter
Phil Elverum is fresh off
the tragic death of his wife
Geneviève, who passed
earlier this year. This
album is essentially Elver-
um’s nauseatingly present
outburst of emotion about
the topic. The compo-
sitions are skeletal and
mostly acoustic; the lyrics
are packed with pathos,
from blunt references to
the time past since her
death to “I brought a chair
from home / I’m leaving
it on the hill / Facing west
and north / And I poured
out your ashes on it / I
guess so you can watch
the sunset / But the truth is
I don’t think of the dust as
you / You are the sunset.”
Every song on this album
is brutally sad, deeply
moving, and otherwise
intense and engaging.
And yet, a better audible
memorial to Geneviève is
inconceivable.

Relatives in Descent
Protomartyr
Protomartyr deliver
solid, progressive Rust
Belt post-punk, with an
artistic streak all of their
own. Ambling, janky
guitar lines are tracked
over plodding drums and
a dragging bassline, while
singer Joe Casey lays
down pure poetry with
a deep, exhausted, won-
derfully enticing voice.
Their latest effort is an
excitingly experimental
step into a unique sound.
Seething and desolate
when downtempo, and
fully punk rock when up,
the hot streak that started
with Agent Intellect con-
tinues onto Relatives in
Descent. Fuck Paramore,
this is what punk in 2017
sounds like.

Crack-Up
Fleet Foxes
Fleet Foxes are a folk
band from the state of
Washington with a knack
for rootsy, reverberating
compositions. Their
sophomore effort, 2011’s
Helplessness Blues, was
an instant classic; then
they immediately went on
hiatus. Their comeback,
Crack-Up, delivers in
spades. The lush vocal
harmonies are now ac-
companied by experimen-
tal song structure, dense
lyricism, and a vibrant in-
strumental palette - from
flitting pianos, to off-kil-
ter woodwind sections,
to soaring violins, which
come together phenome-
nally in perfectly-crafted
orchestrations.This is a
glimmering masterpiece
that shouldn’t be missed.
