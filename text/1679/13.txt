“I wouldn’t
have felt
comfortable
doing this [at
Cambridge].
People would
have said‘who
the fuck do
you think you
are?’”
“I’ve always
been creative
but as soon as
I did a science
degree it went
straight out
the window”
degree it went straight
out of the window; I was
not creative at all. The
course encourages us to
be creative, and it’s just
so new, so I thought I’d
have a go at something,
and find other people who
are being creative, and put
them all in one nice place.
F: Was there a light-
bulb moment for you
in terms of your inter-
action with the arts?
Where you switched
on to it, and you
thought ‘I do really
enjoy arty things, as
well as science’?
J: In my final year of my
undergrad I went out to
Panama, and I was doing
my undergrad research
project in the jungle,
which was great. I took a
sketchbook with me, just
because I thought there
was nobody here to judge
how rubbish I’ve become
after three years of not
drawing. It was really
simple, just pen and ink,
almost like biro pen, but
it was just nice. And then
I submitted it as part of
my report, and they loved
it. It that was really nice
feedback. It was whole-
some and good.
F: When you were in
your undergrad did
you take part in ar-
tistic societies or do
artistic things, or was
there never really
enough time?
J: No, I did volunteering
for a listening charity,
called Oxford Nightline.
I volunteered for them
for two years which took
up a lot of time. I also did
so many extracurricular
things; I organised a ball,
I was housing officer, I
just did too many things.
But none of them were
creative in any way. I
distanced myself from
that and it didn’t feel
right. But drawing takes
so much practice. Even
today, the only drawings
I show people are maybe
one out of 50 that have
maybe gone right.
F: I know when In-
dira spoke to Liliane,
she’s quite passion-
ate about how she
approaches her sci-
entific practice as
an art form. Is that
something you do as
well, or do you keep
them quite separate
in a way?
J: I feel science educa-
tion, even at school, they
remove it completely
[from the arts]. Science
is treated as this discrete,
individual thing, and
there’s a ‘set’ way to do
science. Obviously that
ties into the way the pub-
lication structure works:
you’re not going to be
able to publish a paper
that doesn’t have a meth-
odology section, or has a
nice painting. So, I feel a
lot of people see science
as this immovable, rigid
structure; that’s what my
experience was.
F: And moving back
to Phoenix, we’ve got
a very exciting mini
taster in Felix this
week, and then next
term we’re going on
to the full magazine.
But for this taster,
what can we expect
from it? What are you
excited about?
J: We’ve got a nice
interview with Agnes,
who took the winning
photograph of the Queens
Tower. She talks about
her photograph, and what
she’s done in the past,
because she’s had a bit of
a research career, so that’s
really exciting.
Whether you have a com-
pleted piece, something
in mind, or just want to
get involved, the Phoenix
Editors want to hear from
you: phoenix@ic.ac.uk.
Our wonderful new Phoenix Editors
a music scene. But that’s
talking about the late 90s,
so there’s a whole differ-
ent scene of how students
are as well. Then I went
to Cambridge, which was
another kettle of fish. I
did my PGCE there, and
that’s so upper class –
everyone from private
schools, I wouldn’t have
felt comfortable doing
this [editing Phoenix]
there. I would have felt
that loads of people would
have said ‘who the fuck
do you think you are?’
A: How then did you
get involved with
Phoenix?
C: An email came around
from Fred, and I saw H.G.
Wells mentioned, and I
was like ‘yeah, might as
well apply for this’. I say
I’ve got more confidence
about trying stuff out
now I’m older, I probably
wouldn’t have tried it if I
weren’t a mature student.
A: That’s interesting.
I think a lot of people
who come to Imperial
and study science or
engineering have an
interest in art, but are
too intimidated to
get involved with it.
C: Yeah, they should get
involved with it! Go for
it, like why not? If it goes
wrong, nothing is going to
happen, nobody’s expect-
ing anything, just chuck it
out there, see if it comes
back. What I really want
to see [in Phoenix] is a
wider participation – see
people who don’t think
of themselves as being
arty sending stuff in and
getting it published.
JOY AND FRED
Fred: I thought we
could kick off with
you telling me a bit
about you ‘journey’ –
how did we get to this
point?
Joy: So I studied biology
for my undergrad, and
then after than I took a
year out. I worked, I did
some volunteering with
an environmental charity,
and I worked in a cafe,
and I went cycling for
three months. Then I
came to Imperial; I’m a
part time student, so I’ve
been here a year now, this
is my second year doing
Science Communication.
F: What made you
decide to apply for
Phoenix Editor?
J: I’ve always been
creative – my great aunt
taught me to paint when
I was really little – but
as soon as I did a science

Clash of Cultures: Phoenix Editors special
Phoenix, Felix’s sister arts publication, returns this
week with a teaser 8-page pullout. Arts Editors Indira
Malik and Adam Gellatly and Felix Editor-in-Chief Fred
Fyles talk to Phoenix Editors Liliane Laborde-Edozien,
Catherine Webb, and Joy Aston about their plans for
the magazine and their love of science and art.
ARTS
LILIANE AND INDIRA
Indira: Can you tell
us a bit about what
Phoenix is?
Lilliane: Phoenix was
originally started by H.G.
Wells and was at some
point discontinued, and
then brought back, not
too long ago, to be the
arts magazine, and pay
homage to its history and
founder.
I: And what inspired
you to get involved
with the editorial
team and work with
Phoenix?
L: Despite coming from
scientific training, I’ve
always identified myself
as an artist. That’s a
massive part of my
identity – this weird sci-
entist-artist hybrid. I knew
I wanted to be involved
with the arts, and maintain
that part of my identity. I
saw this opportunity, and
I just felt like I had to give
it a shot. And here I am.
I: This week, we have
an eight-page pull-
out, a kind of ‘Mi-
ni-Phoenix’ for this
term. Could you tell
us a bit more about
what’s going to be in
it, and what we can
look forward to?
L: This week, it’s a
smaller, more condensed
version, because it’s a
kind of a taster.
We’ve kind of es-
tablished what you’ll
normally find in it. You’ll
always have a spotlight
on an artist, where we
will highlight a specific
artist who’s a student
at Imperial, and it will
include an interview, a
chat, and a huge display
of their work. There will
also be a feature article,
where we will touch upon
something relevant to the
arts field and to what’s
going on in today’s world.
Then there’s a gallery
portion, where we have a
curation of several artists
and several pieces – that
can include anything that
we can tap a 2D version
of. It can be flash fiction,
poetry, photography, pho-
tographs of sculptures, or
paintings.
I: What’s going to be
the feature article
this week?
L: This week we are
exploring what we as
a society are willing to
forgive for the sake of
art and for the sake of
genius. We’re exploring
artists who are successful,
and renowned for their
work, but have a darker
history that we don’t pay
any attention to. We look
at whether there will be
a future where we don’t
tolerate monstrosity for
the sake of someone’s
beautiful painting or
beautiful film; and I find,
that we’re generally more
willing to forgive a man
for the sake of art.
I: Do you think the
rules are different for
women artists?
L: A good example is
Jean-Paul Sartre and
Simone de Beauvoir,
a couple engaged in a
polyamorous relationship,
who were both philosoph-
ical writers. De Beauvoir
was under much more
scrutiny for her polyam-
orous lifestyle than Sartre.
Sartre was quite notori-
ous for not necessarily
treating de Beauvoir very
well, but we forget that
because he has Huis clos,
and several other pieces of
literature that we love. De
Beauvoir was under a lot
of scrutiny at the time for
her lifestyle, even though
they were engaging in the
same lifestyle. So I think
there is a bit of a double
standard there.
student on the Science
Communication course.
I did a Biology degree
at Manchester, and then
I had a couple of jobs: a
research job, I worked
in a blood bank. Then I
did a PGCE, and I was a
teacher for quite a while,
in primary schools, eight
years in total. Then I was
a sort-of unwilling house-
wife and stay-at-home
mum in California for a
few years. I couldn’t have
a job in California because
I didn’t have a visa. So I
did that for a few years,
and then I came back,
went back into teaching.
I really like teaching,
I like kids, I like the
creative aspects. But
when I got back from
California, the system had
changed to a point where
I felt that to do a good job
as seen by the government
I would almost be tortur-
ing children into making
them learn things that are
useless and irrelevant –
and research backs me up
on that.
I was on my way to
work one day, in the
dark at 6am, waiting for
the tube, and I was like
‘ugh, why did I become a
teacher?’, and I thought ‘I
think I became a teacher
because I couldn’t afford
to do any postgraduate
study’ but I could afford
to do that now.
The other reason why
I became a teacher
was because I’m really
passionate about people
having a better under-
standing of science and
scientific process, and
more critical thinking
skills to evaluate what
they see in the media. So,
I thought I would hand in
my notice and I did hand
my notice in that day, then
I thought ‘shit, I haven’t
got a job now’. I noticed
there was this course at
Imperial that was really
interesting, so I thought
I’d give it a go.
A: What are your in-
terests in the arts? Is
it something you’ve
been interested in,
is it a more recent
thing?
C: I’ve always been
interested in writing,
I’ve always written.
I’ve written lots of short
stories and a couple of
books for children. I like
going to see art, but I like
it because I don’t really
understand it. In terms of
visual arts, I don’t have
a lot of background in
that kind of thing, but I
think the driving force of
science and the driving
force of arts are the same
thing: curiosity. Trying to
find out about the world,
and then trying to repre-
sent that, whether you’re
doing that through scien-
tific method, or through
drawing, or writing, or
photography. It’s a lot of
the same skills, so to be a
good artist you need to be
a good observer, and to be
a good scientist you need
to be a good observer. I
feel like they’re all in the
same... I think it’s an arti-
ficial distinction between
science and arts.
A: Do you notice any
similarities or dif-
ferences in terms of
how art is perceived
in Manchester, com-
pared to here at Im-
perial?
C: I’d say there was a
livelier scene of what I’d
be more involved in, like
did you face any chal-
lenges in putting to-
gether what you have
so far, or do you en-
visage any challenges
going forward in get-
ting enough material
for an arts magazine?
L: I think initially,
especially if you’re not
thinking creatively, there
are a lot of challenges
on the surface. As you
said we’re in a science
university, who has time
for art? But I find for a
lot of people, that’s not a
unique experience, a lot of
people feel tugged in two
directions.
I always saw the
scientist as an artist and
the artist as a scientist.
I would hang out with
dancers and actors, and
nobody had any idea that I
was a science major, they
thought ‘oh, you’re not
studying philosophy?”
But when I was with them,
and I saw how passionate
and diligent they were
with their craft. I thought
there were so many par-
allels with science, and
how you would approach
science. And it was the
same with scientists;
watching them, I saw
them creating art. I fell
in love with science for
romantic reasons – for me
science is just discovered
magic. So, for me, the
parallels are not much of
a stretch.
Imperial students aren’t
incapable of creating art,
the art is juts a little dif-
ferent. Like growing fungi
on a petri dish and taking
pictures of it – that’s art.
The art of nature, of life,
and of the research.
CATHERINE AND
ADAM
Adam: Can you tell us
a bit about yourself,
what you do at Impe-
rial and your role in
Phoenix?
Catherine: I’m a Masters
“I was on my
way to work
one day...
and I was like
‘ugh, why did
I become a
teacher?’”
I: Coming to some-
where like Imperial,
where we’re primarily
a science university,
“I fell in love
with science
for romantic
reasons – for
me science is
just discovered
magic”
