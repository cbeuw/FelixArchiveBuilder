O
nce more, Felix
has dragged
itself to the end
of the year, like
the bloated, self-satisfied
piece of shit it is. If you
weren’t already familiar
with the events of this
year, then you’ll be de-
lighted to know that the
writers have come up
with a whole bunch of
wonderfully smug retro-
spectives to remind you
of what happened, or to
trigger the next batch of
PTSD and electrotherapy.
People like to wrap up a
year, almost as if to put it
safely away, as an end to
a narrative. In case you
were wondering the deci-
sions and events that you
and I have lived through
this year will continue to
haunt us forever.
2017 has been a year of
highs and lows, but where
the highs are deep below
sea level and the lows
lurk somewhere around
Satan’s anus. Beginning
with the inauguration of
an orange billboard for
white supremacy as the
leader of the free world is
not a particularly auspi-
cious start to the year, and
a considerable amount
of misery and depravity
have sprung from this
single well. Whether it’s
proclaiming that there
are good people on both
sides at a neo-Nazi vs not
neo-Nazi rally, or finally
shooting the Israeli-Pal-
estinian peace process
in the head, the Donald
somehow always finds a
way to make the world a
slightly worse place. All
I can say is, thank you El
Presidente, for giving me
so much more to loathe.
It would be remiss of
me to keep my focus on
only one key player in
distance of a functioning
nuclear deterrent. Natu-
rally, I look forward to
being erased in a haze of
atomic fire, but I’d prefer
to be incinerated in the
midst of a catastrophic
showdown between the
world’s superpowers and
not by a chubby bloke that
assassinated his brother
with nerve gas and shot
his uncle with an anti-air-
craft gun.
Third and fourth on
this list must of course go
to Putin and Xi Jingping,
mostly because I’d be at
risk of being assassinated
if they weren’t on here.
You don’t have to be a
gay-hating expansionist
dictator, or just a ruthless
Tibetan-hating dictator
to make this list but it
definitely helps. Special
thanks goes to Putin for
stabilising the Assad
regime and obstructing
the UN investigation into
use of chemical weapons.
Final place of this filler
article must of course go
to the UK government.
have handled everything
thrown at them like a
blind, quadruple-amputee
trying to play catch. I
hate fucking incompe-
tents. I am greatly looking
forward to next year when
all of my favourite charac-
ters reappear, and I get to
hate them for all kinds of
new reasons.
Finally, as some sort
of catharsis to finishing
the last piece of the year,
I extend my antipathy to
you, my peers. I can’t put
my finger on exactly why
I hate you so, possibly
your pathetic attachment
to Stella or your frankly
disturbing lack of opinions
on anything important. I
hope you all have exams
after Christmas so you
can’t enjoy it and that all
your New Year’s goals are
unfulfilled. Have a shit
2018.
“You don’t
have to be a
dictator to
make this list,
but it helps”
this year’s crock of shit.
Second place of course
must go to everyone’s
favourite fat Korean, Kim
Jong-Un. While he is a
must on all lists of this
nature thanks to his large
girth and his people’s
constant emaciation due
to famine, Kim’s major
achievement this year
has been to place North
Korea within touching
“Finally, I
extend my
antipathy to
you, my peers.
I can’t put
my finger on
exactly why I
hate you”
I enjoy nothing more
than to witness their
serial incompetency
with regards Brexit, the
election or handling
anything remotely sen-
sitive. Between them
Boris Johnson, Theresa
May, and David Davis
Felix is hiring!
We’re looking for writers, editors, photographers, illustrators,
grammar nerds, computer geeks, and all-round great people to
join our team in 2018!
