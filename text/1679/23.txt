W
hile jogging
in the park,
have you
ever spotted
people holding binoculars
and looking up in the sky?
Or those flipping through
a pocket-sized booklet
that says ‘Collins Bird
Guide’on the cover? They
are birdwatchers, with the
love for birds and curiosity
to explore nature. As one
of them, I go out to differ-
ent places to observe birds
in their most natural and
undisturbed environment.
Birdwatching is getting
increasingly popular and
is an absolutely fun and
exciting outdoor activity.
However, when being
a birdwatcher clashes
with being a full-time
undergraduate student,
you often struggle to find
time to simply dash into
the wild and see new bird
species. But this May,
I was lucky enough to
go on a weekend trip to
Pembrokeshire, organised
by the Fellwanderers, the
IC hiking society. As a
birdwatcher who hasn’t
been in the fields for quite
a while, I decided to travel
with a bunch of mountain
fanatics and search for one
of my favourite birds – the
gannet.
Unfortunately, it was
raining the whole morning
on the first day of hiking,
and there were no signs
of any birds. I felt a bit
dampened as I slowly put
the binoculars back into
my bag and continued
climbing.
Around noon, we ap-
proached an open pebble
beach. By that time, the
rain had stopped and the
clouds had started to clear.
I joined others in observ-
ing clams on rocks that
were constantly breathing
out foam. A few birds
flew off, wailing above
the sea, so I took out my
binoculars for a closer
look. “Not exciting”, I
murmured to myself, “just
some seagulls”.
As I moved my binocu-
lars across the sea, a dark
and swift figure suddenly
caught my attention – the
wings were longer and
narrower, with dark
markings at the tips. It
was gliding low over the
sea and suddenly plunged
into the water. A few
seconds later, it emerged
at a different spot. My
heart started to pound as
I could see its distinctive
beak – lo and behold, it
was a gannet! And in real
life it looked a lot larger
than I expected! The
excitement was doubled
as I discovered there
were three more gannets
hovering further in the
distance. In spite of the
strong wind, they were
cruising in the air with
such amazing balance and
stability. They lingered
for a while, then flew
further and eventually
disappeared over the far
horizon.
We left the pebble
beach and ascended to
the top of a hill. The
view was wider, and I
noticed a crow-like bird
gliding along the cliff. I
pulled out my camera and
quickly took a few shots.
The bright red beak gave
away its species – it was
a chough. I found that
particularly surprising
since I didn’t expect to
see a chough on the coast.
In the next few fours, I
also added a few new
species to my list – siskin,
buzzard, and red kite.
This trip made me
realize that sometimes
we forget how incredible
wildlife is, especially after
living in huge cities for a
long time. But if we start

paying more attention to
living creatures around us,
we can begin to appreciate
the beauty and diversity
of nature. With this new
perspective in mind,
travelling can turn into
a different and amazing
wildlife adventure. So
keep your mind open and
never stop exploring!
Birdwatching offers a new and exciting way of travelling – all you need is a pair of binoculars and a passion for
wildlife. Birdwatching enthusiast and soon-to-be biology graduate Mingke Pan has been there, done that, and
loved it!
