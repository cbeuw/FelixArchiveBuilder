Felix archives reveal Imperial’s
misogynistic Past

years of efforts for change

L
ast year, Imperial
released a review
of Imperial’s
i n s t i t u t i o n a l
culture, and the impact
that this culture has on
gender equality at our
university. The review,
was prompted by “a
series of events involving
the men’s student rugby
team”, which reached a
nadir with accusations of
sexism at Varsity 2015.
The report found many
instances of bullying
and discrimination at
Imperial, which were
largely linked to sexism
and homophobia – one
participant said that the
“ingrained misogyny” at
Imperial was “so deep that
it had become normal”.
How did we get to this
point? Some sociologists
may point to the rise
of the ‘lad mag’ in the
1990s, which promoted
objectification of women,
as an explanation for the
nascent ‘lad culture’ that
can be found across many
university campuses
– indeed, a report by
the National Union of
Students found that
contemporary lad culture
was contextualised by the
increasing proportion of
women in higher educa-
tion, which some theorists
had led to a kick-back by
those who felt their mas-
culinity was threatened.
At Imperial, at least,
this is nothing new. The
archives of Felix will
show you that women
have faced extreme hostil-
ity on campus for attempt-
ing to put forward ideas
of equality. The debates
that raged over the Union
Bar in the 20th
century
are one example: until at
least 1974, women were
not allowed in the Union
Bar – or rather, there were
never any rules against it,
but men would stop them
entering. A Felix article
of that year talks about
Kay Nickelson, the first
female captain of an ACC
club (fencing, in case you
were interested), but who
was unable to use her
tankard, since she was
“not allowed in the Union
Bar”. In the same issue, a
letter from a male student
says that while he can’t
see any reason for women
to be banned, he also can’t
see what right “a few
women in IC [have to]
demand that the average
IC student stop enjoying
himself”.
Five years before this,
a paper was presented to
Union Council to allow
women into the Bar, but
it was defeated – the
proposer was met with
“pandemonium, paper
darts, and cries of ‘off’”,
while one opposition
member said that “the
activities in the Union
Bar were not for women
to see or hear”. Another
motion was raised two
years later, which would
prevent any form of dis-
crimination against those
using the Union Bar, but
it failed – Council had
“overwhelmingly” voted
to include an amendment
that “all persons entering
the Bar be naked from the
waist up”.
When the usual proce-
dures failed, a number of
students turned to more
radical means, ‘invading’
the Union Bar against the
will of its male patrons: in
1969, Women’s Lib and
Gay Lib attempted to enter
the Bar, but were “kicked
out”, and a couple of
years later Women’s Lib
attempted to gain entry to
the Bar again. When they
tried to enter the Bar the
same night as the Chap’s
Club Dinner – one of
Imperial’s historical ‘tie
clubs’, which at the time
was affiliated with RSMU
– one woman had two
pints of beer poured over
her. The men then tried to
force her to down a yard
of beer, at which point she
poured it over the head of
the RCSU President, and
was forcibly removed. .
While it would be easy
to place the entirety of the
blame on the men in the
Union Bar, when you go
through these articles you
realise how sexist and dis-
criminatory some of the
language used by Felix
writers was. Women’s
underwear used to be
hung over the bar, and
any attempts to remove
them stopped. The issue
was described as “trivial”,
while women trying to
get into the Bar are char-
acterised as “aggressive”.
In one article, one of the
Women’s Lib members
complains about the
advances made by “horny
old perverts present in the
bar”, at which point the
writer inserts their own
opinion: “maybe this is
why we keep women out
of the Bar.”
A culture of inequality
does not come out of
nowhere. While women
might be more welcome
in the Union Bar today,
last year’s report shows
we have a long way to go.

Here’s what I’m up
to at the moment!
M
y role as Gender Equality
Officer is to combat and raise
awareness of issues regarding
gender equality, from sexism
and unconscious bias to sexual harassment.
I want to create an inclusive environment at
Imperial, where all genders are represented
and can carry out their studies without the
threat of harassment in any form.
I am in the process of proposing a
confidential and straightforward platform
that could be found on the Imperial app
or online, for reporting incidents of sexism,
sexual harassment, or assault at Imperial.
Currently, there is no clear guidance for
members of the college who want to report
incidents of this nature and in trying to do
so they are likely to undergo a lengthy and
complicated process, before they can even
begin to get the action and support they
deserve. Through this platform, I hope to
remove the barriers that stand in the way of
people reporting incidents, whilst ensuring
that the reporting process brings effective
action, with no trauma to the victim.
Next term,Iamplanningtorunacampaign
on everyday sexism and unconscious bias,
but if you have any campaigns that you
want to run regarding gender equality (or
just any questions/ideas you want to let
me know about!) send me an email on icu-
gender-equality@ic.ac.uk.
Through working with the careers service,
there will now be a set of workshops at the
end of this academic year, designed to help
women excel in the world of interviews,
negotiating and work – so keep an eye out
for these if you are interested!
