K
nowing that
s o m e o n e
likes to cook
makes picking
a Christmas gift a lot
easier for you. Felix
came here with a list of
our 10 picks – hopefully,
Santa will see this and
will know which one you
would like to see under
that Christmas tree.
1. Chef’s knife
– This says it all.
You can never have
enough knives and
you always can get
a better one.
2. American sea-
food by Barton
Seaver – because
good start. A lot
of the recipes are
healthy – or, at
least, healthier
than Buzzfeed.
6. A good mix
of herbs – just, be-
cause, eventually,
you will end up en-
joying them too.
7. Garden in a can
– maybe this is just
me, because I am
a biologist, but the
idea of growing my
own herbs sounds
amazing! And will
probably save a lot
of money, in the
long run, too.
8. Better Baking
by Genevieve Ko –
Baking. But better.
Enough said.
seafood is always
nice, but oh so diffi-
cult to cook and this
seems like a good
starting reference
3. Wok – To im-
prove their Asian
cooking skills.
4. Coffeemaker –
Ok, this is a good
gift for anyone, not
just for people who
love cooking. You
don’t have to get
something expen-
sive, just something
that feels right and
that you would use.
5. Jamie Oliver’s
cookery books – for
anyone who wishes
to start cooking but
just doesn’t know
where to start from,
they are a really
9. Cheese knives
– for all the fancy
eaters out there
who think that
cheese fondue is a
must (which it ob-
viously is, duh)
10.Brewing kit
– Especially if
they are studying
chemistry or are
just very hipster.

HOT CHOCOLATE ADVENTURES

its arrival in
London sev-
eral weeks ago when
the department stores
assembled their window
display extravaganzas
and numerous shopping
streets had grand switch-
on ceremonies for their
array of twinkly lights
(the annual chance for
forgotten celebrities to
shine).
But the recent chill
in the air and brief
snow flurry, which I
sadly missed (typical),
confirmed that winter
has indeed begun. This
weather gets us all
reaching for a few ne-
cessities, fluffy blankets,
bobble hats and sugary
hot drinks.
Move over pumpkin
spiced latte, it’s time
for the festive winter
warmers to reign
supreme. This has given
me the perfect excuse
to run all over London
trying different hot
chocolates. Such a chore,
but hey, someone had to
do it. I’ve picked three to
tell you all about – one
traditional, one hipster,
and one that’s somehow
both, a hybrid if you will.
Le Pain Quotidien –
The Traditional One
I nipped down Ex-
hibition Road between
lectures to try the tradi-
tional Belgian hot choc-
olate served at Le Pain
Quotidien. A bowl of
steamed milk with a thin
layer of foam on top was
brought to my table with
like molten chocolate,
basically a chocolate
sauce – yum. The hipster
element comes from the
fact that the mugs are
dipped in the holy trinity
itself was too bitter for my
taste, and so I had to drink
it slowly with small sips.
But it was balanced really
well by the sweetness of
the massive (imagine ice
cream scoop size) toasted
marshmallow placed on
top, which would arguably
be too sickly sweet if the
liquid was less bitter. So
perhaps it works? This
one’s definitely down to
personal taste. It’s perfect
for people who feel that
a hot chocolate isn’t a
hot chocolate unless
garnished with marshmal-
lows. They also embellish
it with a small chocolate
square bearing the name
‘Chin Chin’on it, which is
a nice touch, but let’s face
it, more for the aesthetic
on Instagram than for
anything else.
Said Dal 1923 – The
Hybrid
The hot chocolates
served at this rustic Soho
cafe are traditional in the
sense that they originate
from Roman recipes.
The delicious drink is
a separate small jug of
thick liquid hot chocolate.
Pouring the chocolate
into the bowl and mixing
it into the milk certainly
adds a fun element to
hot chocolate drinking.
The downside is that it’s
impossible to get all the
contents of the jug out
“I’ve
picked one
traditional,
one hipster,
and one that’s
somehow
both, a hybrid
if you will”
by pouring it. I ended up
scraping every last bit out
using a spoon and eating
it neat in a desperate
attempt to not waste any.
Food wastage in any form
is never good. The drink
is milkier than the average
hot chocolate. Think of it
as the latte equivalent of
the hot chocolate family.
As someone who is not
a huge fan of the taste
of milk, I prefer a more
indulgent hot chocolate,
but each to their own.
Chin Chin – The
Hipster One
This small chain started
in Camden, where it’s
called Chin Chin Labs,
and is famous for its nitro
ice-cream; hipster or
what. It has now spread to
a couple of other locations
in London, including the
Chin Chin Dessert Club
in Soho, where I dragged
a friend earlier in the
week. The hot chocolate
“The mugs are
dipped in the
holy trinity of
chocolates:
dark, milk
and white.
You heard me
right.”
of chocolates: dark, milk
and white. You heard me
right. This is as close as
you are ever going to get
to drinking hot choco-
late in a chocolate cup,
which of course would
be incredibly impractical.
They offer three types of
hot chocolate drink: dark,
milk, and gianduia (with
hazelnut). I opted for the
milk chocolate but they
all looked and smelled
amazing. I’ll probably
return over the Christmas
period to try the other two.
If you’re keen to go,
I’d recommend visiting
during the week. Last time
I tried to go on a Saturday
they were queuing out the
door. So I eventually gave
up and went elsewhere. On
this occasion, the person
at the back of the queue
called up Said Dal 1923
to book and managed to
skip the queue. Who knew
desperation for a good hot
chocolate would lead to
such sneaky tactics. I will
totally use this strategy
next time.
Pouring the liquid chocolate into the milk at Le Pain
Quotidien could be a new form of art. I’m expecting a
call from the Saatchi Gallery any day now
This one’s for the budding Instagramers looking for
inspiration. Head to Greek Street, Soho
This is what it looked before I scraped all the chocolate
off. No regrets
“Chin Chin
is definitely
down to per-
sonal taste.
It’s perfect for
those who feel
a hot choc-
olate isn’t a
hot chocolate
unless it’s got
marshmal-
lows”
