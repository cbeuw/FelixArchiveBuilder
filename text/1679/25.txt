KFC IN JAPAN

H
ow does a
country with
a very low
p r o p o r t i o n
of Christians celebrate
Christmas? 3 letters; K,
F, C. The celebration of
Christmas day has, in
Japan, become inextri-
cably linked with eating
fried chicken with long
queues throughout the
day for some finger lick-
ing goodness. The story
begins in the 70’s with
an intrepid businessman,
who later became the
CEO of KFC Japan,
creating the special KFC
Christmas bucket and
corresponding ad cam-
paign. From there on
it’s anyone’s guess as to
Eight maids-a-
			 milking
how it spread, but with
an estimated 3.6 million
Japanese families re-
portedly eating KFC on
Christmas, it’s certainly
cemented itself as a
festive tradition. While
we wait for the next
anthropological journal
to cover this bizarre
tradition I would suggest
it probably came down
to clever marketing by
KFC over the years
helped by the Japanese
ability to monetize just
about any holiday. Mix
this with a lack of avail-
ability of turkey and of
course Japan’s bizarre
love ofAmerican culture
and you’ve got yourself
a recipe for a chicken,
and the legendary 11
spices, takeover. And
me? I went for a sushi
dinner. Christmas is
about treating yourself,
I’ll save the KFC for a
post exam binge.
CHRISTMAS ROAST PORK WITH RIB
GRAVY AND APPLE BREAD SAUCE
ROAST PORK
1. Place the pork belly in a tray.
2. Dry the meat as well as you can with a
paper towel and then rub in salt.
3. Ideally, you would let it stay in the fridge
overnight, but if you don’t have enough time,
set it aside for at least one hour.
4. Roast the pork belly for 30 minutes at
250°C, before turning the oven down to
150°C and roasting for another 90 minutes
5. Serve!
RIB GRAVY
1. Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the pork
ribs and fry for 5 minutes or until caramel-
ised.
2. Remove the ribs from the pan and add in
the onions and carrots.
3. Pour over the stock and bring to a boil.
Try to scrape in all the burnt bits from the
bottom of the pan.
4. When the mixture starts boiling, add the
ribs back in. Add the peppercorn, bay leaves
and thyme. Continue simmering for 1½ hours.
5. Remove the meat form the ribs and return
in into the gravy mixture
APPLE BREAD SAUCE
Four calling birds Six geese-a-laying
You will need...
• 400g plain flour
• 1 tsp bicarbonate of
soda
• 2 tsp ground ginger
• 1 tsp ground cinna-
mon
• 125g butter (unsalt-
ed)
• 200g honey
• 2 eggs
1. Mix all the dry ingredients and then add
in the butter. This step would be really easy
if you have a food processor, but I imagine
that, as a student, you don’t have such fan-
cy kitchen appliances. You can solve this
problem by using a hand mixer in the be-
ginning, but then you have to start with the
butter and then gradually add a bit of flour
at a time. When your hand mixer cannot do
the job anymore, you’ll have to use your
hands. Or, of course, you can start from the
beginning by using your hands. I have faith
in you, you can do this!
2. Beat the egg and the honey together un-
til they are homogeneous. Pour them over
the dry ingredients, a little at a time. You
should try to avoid lumps in your dough.
3. Knead the dough until smooth and then
wrap in cling-film.
4. Leave to chill in the fridge for 30 min-
utes to an hour.
5. Roll the dough (after you took it out of
the fridge and unwrapped it, but if you re-
ally need this advice, you should stay out
of the kitchen – just saying!) on a floured
surface. Cut out the ginger men – or wom-
en! Maybe you want to let your inner artist
surface, and be creative with the cutting.
6. Bake for 12-20 minutes until gold-
en-brown – to any extent, it shouldn’t take
longer than a Two and a Half Men episode.
If, meanwhile, your fire alarm starts, you
should have taken them out 10 minutes
ago, at least!
7. When cool enough (of course they can-
not be as cool as you are, but they will try
their best), decorate!
8. Optional step: hide them from your
hungry flatmates who will finish all your
food.

MINCE PIES

W
hile you
m i g h t
have heard
about the
most typical Spanish
Christmas foods, I want
to focus on a relatively
unknown Christmas
sweet: the alfajor,
consumed generally in
the south of Spain, and
definitely a high point
in humanity’s culinary
achievements.
An alfajor is a very
special sweet, made
mostly out of honey,
nuts, and spices. How
can I explain the expe-
rience of having one?
When you try it, the
first thing you notice is
the sugar coating. But
before you know it,
tradition, dating back to
the times of Muslim Spain
in the Middle Ages. And
yet it has somehow found
its way into becoming a
staple of a predominantly
Christian celebration.
you’ll find yourself deep
into the slightly hard,
consistent texture, which
will then merge into an
explosive combination
of hazelnut, almond, and
honey, with cilantro and
cinnamon giving a final
special touch to an abso-
lutely glorious flavour.
The concepts of majesty,
beauty, and grandeur
are all condensed
into one small
sweet.
There is
something I
have always
found really
peculiar about
this sweet. The
name, Alfajor,
comes from the
Spanish-Arab
al-hasú, which
essentially means
“the filling”. This
is because the recipe
comes from an Arab
E
very country in
the world seems
to have its
Christmas food.
Here, they are Christmas
cake and mince pies –
which disappointed me
at first. A lot. But, hey,
British food can grow on
you. Eventually.
Squashed peach and
almond mince pies
This was the first
mince pie I’ve tried and
I was a bit like “Where
is the mince?” Since
then I’ve learnt what
mince pies are and I must
definitely confirm that
they are very nice with a
glass of red wine.
Traditional mince
pies – actually con-
tain meat!
These are probably
the last ones I’ve tried
and I think they are fairly
difficult to find, with all
these sweet mince pies
that are around. They
are interesting, to say
at least, but they are
definitely not a dessert.
Still, I can see them as
a nice starter on most
Christmas tables.
admit that these peach and
almond ones are my fa-
vourite. They are soft with
some crunchy bits, and
sweet enough to satisfy
my need for sugar.
Apple and satsuma
mince pies
These are the softest
mince pies I’ve tried
because the apples are
normally grated. I think
that apples and orange
are normally a very good
mix and they just scream
‘Christmas is here’.
Besides, there are some
versions that contain rum,
too.
Cherry, mincemeat
and liqueur mince
pies
The cherry and the
liqueur add a luxurious
side to the mince and,
for the brave one, they
can also be mixed with
a cocoa batter. This is
definitely something
special and dark – not an
everyday mince pie but
something to really enjoy.
Lottie Shaw’s serious-
ly good mince pies
These are sort of a
mystery, if you ask me!
They claim to be the “au-
thentic taste of Christmas”
and, weirdly, I feel like
they are – even if I have no
idea what authentic mince
pies taste like. They are
mouth-watering and the
pastry is delicious. Even if
I cannot say for sure what
they are filled with, I can
If you’re one of those
jolly lefties that can’t
stand this new notion of
“cultural appropriation”,
just keep in mind that
we in Spain have been
casually doing it for the
best part of a thousand
years.
