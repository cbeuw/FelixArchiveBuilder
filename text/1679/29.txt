Imperial enforces police state as bike thefts rise

F
ollowing on
from the recent
increase in
crime on cam-
pus, Imperial College
management are en-
forcing a police state on
campus.
Last week saw chemis-
try students breaking into
the Business School Cafe,
which left numerous MBA
students hurt and upset
when they realised they
were actually doing a soft
science. Further reports
have also been coming
through of an increase in
bike thefts across campus-
es, as well as numerous
instances of students
being pickpocketed in the
Fusion queue as they try
to decide between chicken
pilau and beef noodles.
As a result of these
incidents the College have
taken what they described
as “unprecedented meas-
ures” to ensure safety on
campus. Ethan Shadwell,
Vice-Provost (Broken
Windows Theory) told
Felix that “it was time
we returned to the values
of law and order. For too
long staff and students
have been feeling unsafe
on campus – why, many
of us in the Faculty
Building are too scared to
leave our offices lest we
run into feral students. Do
you know how many law-
suits we’ve had because
a Faculty employee has
bumped into a student
who got lost in the Blue
Cube? Obviously you
don’t, because we don’t
publish that information.
But it’s been a lot, let me
changes beginning from
this week: the College
has hired Blackwater, a
private security company,
to patrol the campus 24
hours a day, and from 1st
January 2018 a curfew
will be in effect, with
students only allowed to
move around the campus
atsetpointsthroughoutthe
day. Those who are found
breaking this curfew will
be placed in detention in
that giant silver cylinder
in the foyer, which has
been converted into a
temporary holding pen
until new space opens up
at Imperial White City
campus.
One student we spoke
to welcomed the changes:
“I spend so much time in
the library and in win-
dowless labs,” he said,
“that just going outside
has become an ordeal
for me. I’m terrified that
somebody might initiate
the human interaction I’ve
gone without for the past
six months. Thanks to
the College’s new ‘loose
Dalby Court has seen a rise in drive-by snakery in recent months // FJ Gaylor
welcome the change,
however. Sarah, a final
year biochemistry under-
graduate told Felix about
her experience of the
new security measures:
“I just missed the cut off
for the curfew because
I’d waited 30 minutes in
the Tanpopo queue. As I
was rushing across Dalby
Court, one of the security
guys fully tackled me into
the ground. Not only did
I have to spend the rest
of the day in that weird
cylinder, but I dropped
my katsu curry. I was so
annoyed.”
One academic wel-
comed the changes,
however – “I’m sick and
tired of these thefts,” they
told Felix, “not only has
my bicycle been nicked,
but now my pension is
being stolen too. Wait, is
this not about that?”
“Those
breaking the
curfew will be
placed in that
giant silver
cylinder in the
foyer”
“‘Not only has
my bike been
nicked’, the
academic told
Felix,‘but now
my pension’s
being stolen’”
tell you.”
Students and staff
on campus will notice
lips sink ships’ policy, I
no longer have to worry
about subversives plotting
to take over Queen’s
Tower, or anyone making
awkward small talk with
me.”

give up the autonomy
she’s fostered over a
term of university, and
can’t see anything
going wrong.

A
biology fresh-
er has told
friends and
peers how
excited she is to be
going back home for the
holidays.
Alice Smee, a first year
biologist, has spent the
last two weeks enthusing
to her coursemates and
“I just can’t wait to be
back there,” Smee told
Felix, “it’s going to be
so great to be away from
the hustle and bustle of
London. I don’t think that
my home town is going to
seem small, provincial, or
parochial at all. I’m also
really excited to seeing
somebody my mum
knows every time I leave
the house to pick up some
milk.”
The student’s hallmates
reported that Smee had
been mentioning how
much she missed her home
friends since the middle
of first term: “she wasn’t
saying it in a pass-ag
way,” one of her hallmates
told Felix, “more in a kind
of ‘university life wasn’t
what I was expecting, and
I’m finding it difficult to
connect with people, but I
can always sustain myself
with memories of friend-
ships with the people I
went to school with, but
who are now completely
different after nearly three
months away from home,
meaning this illusion will
shatter as soon as I meet up
with them for an awkward
drink in the local pub and
they all keep mentioning
people I’ve never met’
kind of way.”
When asked whether
she had any concerns,
Smee told Felix “I guess
I’m a little worried that
spending three months
with complete autonomy
about when I go to bed,
what I eat, and how I
spend my day will mean
that transitioning back
into a routine where
everything I do is moni-
tored and commented on
by my parents might be a
bit difficult, but I’m sure it
will all be fine.”

Fresher looking forward to losing freedom over
Christmas holidays
This week it’s the end of
deadlines. You decide to
celebrate having no more
all nighters to pull by
pulling an all nighter in
the Slug.
This week you’re the
Central Library and
you’re open again!
Maybe. Who knows.
This week you use your
club’s annual dinner to
really reevaluate the true
meaning of Christmas:
throwing up in the local
Spoons and having a
minimum-wage employee
clean up your vomit.
This week you take time
to look back at 2017.
It’s all pretty clear, but
you can never remember
Wednesday evenings for
some reason.
This week you decide
to get your house in the
festive spirit, and put
on Christmas carols to
drown out the sounds
of your housemates
having sex while you
contemplate dying alone.
This week you stalk your
secret santa on the gram
for inspiration. It’s all
going fine until you like
a post from 2014 about
their cat dying.
This week Imperial has
put up their Christmas
trees everywhere. The
smell of pine needles
really helps distract you
from the mind-numbing
experience of doing a
degree here.
This week you did RAG
Jailbreak, and you made
it all the way to Tonga.
You’re never coming
back.
This week you realise
Christmas is a cruel and
twisted celebration of
capitalist greed, which
encourages reckless
spending and short term
material happiness. But
have you seen the John
Lewis ad yet? So great.
This week you’re IC
Big Band doing a gig in
Metric. You’re not sure
how, but you have beer
on your music, and one of
the audience has thrown
up over the saxophones.
Better take your jazzy
riffs elsewhere.
This week you’re the
Felix horoscope writer,
and you’ve finally got a
break from this week-in
week-out shit. See you
next year!
“‘I don’t think
my home town
is going to
seem parochial
at all’”
those in her hall that she’s
really looking forward to
going back to her parents’
house in Berkshire for
three weeks over the
holidays.
