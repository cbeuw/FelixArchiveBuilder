FUTURE
Future
In February, Future qui-
etly went about making
history by dropping two
albums, FUTURE and
HNDRXX, in the space
of seven days. In doing
so, he became the first
artist in music history
to have two different
albums debut at num-
ber one in consecutive
weeks. On HNDRXX,
we were met with the
more vulnerable, sensi-
tive side of Future but,
with FUTURE being
home to two of my fa-
vourite tracks of the
year in I’m So Groovy
and the infectious Mask
Off, I couldn’t deny his
eponymous album its
spot on my list.

Pretty Girls Like
Trap Music
2 Chainz
Martin Luther King Jr.
famously once said,
“we hold these truths to
be self-evident, that all
men are created equal;
that water is wet; and
that 2 Chainz simply
does not deliver bad
verses”. I challenge an-
yone reading to find me
a bad 2 Chainz verse in
the last six years (his
verse on the remix of
Robin Thicke’s 2013
track, Give It 2 U, is
the closest I can recall).
Pretty Girls Like Trap
Music is a hood classic
from one of the most
consistent veterans in
the game right now.

Laila’s Wisdom
Rapsody
I first encountered Rap-
sody when she stole
the show with the fi-
nal verse on Kendrick
Lamar’s Complexion
(A Zulu Love) from his
2015 album To Pimp a
Butterfly. It is not often
that a rapper completely
outshines Kendrick on a
track but Rapsody is not
your average artist. Her
immaculately woven
lyrical content shines
through on Laila’s Wis-
dom, an album which
has been dangerously
slept on in my opinion,
and even to earn itself
a well-deserved 2018
Grammy nomination
for “Best Rap Album” .

Wins & Losses
Meek Mill
After the monumental
L he sustained in his
infamous 2015 beef
with Drake, Meek Mill
found his career at a
crossroads. Although
his core fan base re-
mained loyal, many
casual Meek Mill fans
simply lost interest and
didn’t want to hear from
him anymore, reducing
him to little more than
the easily meme-able
butt of the joke. Things
had gone quiet for
Meek and he faced the
challenge of reviving
his faltering career and
recapturing the hearts
and minds of his wider
audience. The October
2016 release of his DC4
mixtape, the fourth in-
stalment of his Dream-
chasers series, served as
a welcome reminder of
Meek’s talent as an MC
and arguably reignited
the fire that his career
had been severely lack-
ing. With Wins & Loss-
es, Meek successfully
managed to put his ca-
reer back on track, de-
livering a stellar project
on which we hear him
at his most versatile,
rapping frankly, open-
ly and honestly about
the various wins he’s
enjoyed and losses he’s
endured. I would argue
that the Drake beef ul-
timately helped Meek
more than it did Drake,
renewing his focus and
forcing fans to realise
exactly what they were
missing whilst he was
silent. The reaction of
the hip-hop community
to Meek’s recent rein-
carceration for violating
parole, which sparked
the wider conversation
surrounding parole in
the American criminal
justice system, is proof
that hip-hop culture has
widely accepted Meek
Mill again.
antics more entertaining
and appealing than his
music but, as a casual
fan of his music, I was
pleasantly surprised
to hear a more ma-
ture-sounding Tyler dis-
cuss themes including
depression, loneliness
and his sexuality on
this smooth, introspec-
tive album. As his name
suggests, Tyler, The
Creator, is a creative
force to be reckoned
with and the fact that he
also solely produced the
entire album affirms his
standing as one of the
culture’s most creative
influences. Flower Boy
is fully deserving of its
2018 Grammy nomi-
nation for “Best Rap
Album” and, although
he is the underdog, it
would be brilliant to
see Tyler take home the
Grammy for this excel-
lent project.

Culture
Migos
From their signature
‘Migos flow’ infiltrat-
ing the mainstream to
the Atlanta trio popular-
ising the ‘dab’, Migos
dictates a lot of what
happens in hip-hop
culture today. Migos is
aware of its wide-reach-
ing influence and, thus,
it’s fitting that they
chose the album title
Culture: Migos is the
culture! The first half of
Culture is arguably the
strongest of any album
this year, with four of
my favourite tracks this
year (T-Shirt, Call Cast-
ing, Get Right Witcha
and Slippery) as well as
the ubiquitous Bad and
Boujee all coming with-
in the first 25 minutes.
Migos is the world’s
biggest rap group and
their chemistry is so
evident that sometimes
I question if Quavo,
Offset and Takeoff all
share the same brain.
Although they face stiff
competition, part of me
wants to see the three
Migos take home the
“Best RapAlbum” 2018
Grammy for Culture.

Jay Z
Listening to projects
from legendary veteran
rappers can often be jar-
ring. I sometimes feel
like their work must
be venerated because
of everything they’ve
achieved. However, on
the other hand, it’s usu-
ally abundantly clear
that this artist is past

Flower Boy
Tyler, The Creator
I’ve always found Ty-
ler’s wacky, hilarious
their prime and it can
even be cringeworthy to
hear them attempt to re-
produce their previous
magic or attempt to re-
main relevant by jump-
ing on the latest popular
wave. With it being four
years since the release
of his distinctly less
than spectacular Magna
Carta Holy Grail, I can
forgive anyone for ex-
pecting Jay Z to fall into
the aforementioned cat-
egory. However, Jay Z
expertly avoids this on
4:44, delivering a truly
stunning, more personal
album of mature, soulful
and emotional content.
Although Jay has spent
over two decades at the
pinnacle of hip-hop and
his career has been one
of remarkable, unprec-
edented consistency, I
feel that he has always
kept fans at arm’s length
to some extent, portray-
ing himself as a hustler
and the living embodi-
ment of swag, but rarely
letting us know what he
is dealing with beneath
the surface.
For this reason, I some-
times find it difficult to
connect with his music
on a deeper, emotional
level. On 4:44, Jay Z fi-
nally dedicates a whole
album to showing vul-
nerability, rapping
honestly and addressing
his infidelity and mari-
tal struggles. The album
is also full of gems, with
Jay giving the younger
generation business ad-
vice focused on diver-
sifying assets, invest-
ing in and supporting
black business in order
to build generational
wealth within the black
community. Music jour-
nalist Touré claimed,
“for hip-hop to contin-
ue to thrive, there must
be a true adult wing for
the grown folks who
loved hip-hop in its ear-
ly years but now have
families and no time to
go to the clubs…” and,
at 48 years old (practi-
cally a pensioner as far
as rap is concerned), it’s
refreshing to see Jay Z
continue to push the
culture forward. The
album’s brevity is the
only reason 4:44 hasn’t
landed higher on this
list but Jay’s induction
into the Songwriters
Hall of Fame and the
eight Grammy nomina-
tions received by 4:44
are simply more acco-
lades to embellish his
already storied career.

More Life
Drake
Although it isn’t imme-
diately obvious, Drake
is currently undergoing
the most difficult peri-
od of his career so far.
Ever since Drake rose
to mainstream promi-
nence in 2009, he has
lived a charmed life. He
rapidly rose to the sum-
mit of hip-hop and he’s
sat there ever since, as
evidenced by his om-
nipresence on the Bill-
board Hot 100 (Drake
had a song in the charts
every week for the past
eight years). Howev-
er, with his astounding
Billboard streak coming
to an end this year and
considering the some-
what lukewarm recep-
tion to his latest offer-
ing, More Life, could
this be confirmation that
Drake has peaked, and
his career is about to be-
gin a slow decline? Will
we see Drizzy’s impact
on the culture diminish?
Regardless, I still think
More Life is a great
project and was an im-
provement on 2016’s
Views. Drake tows the
line between appropria-
tion and showing appre-
ciation perfectly on this
project, paying homage
to his numerous musical
influences. These musi-
cal influences include
the Afro-Caribbean
and UK music scenes.
Tracks like ‘KMT’,
‘Sacrifices’ and ‘Pas-
sionfruit’ are amongst
my favourites from this
year and I’m convinced
Drake still has a few
more years at the top of
hip-hop.

ALL-AMERIKKKAN
BADA$$
Joey Bada$$
With ALL-AMERIK-
KKAN BADA$$, Joey
Bada$$ arguably deliv-
ered a more important
message through his
music than that which
we have heard from any
other album in 2017.
The album is an abra-
sive, politically charged
body of work that takes
aim at white Ameri-
ca, white supremacy
and, of course, Donald
Trump. It is refreshing
to hear such social con-
sciousness and activism
from one of the young-
er rappers in the game,
with Joey recognising
the responsibility he
has as an artist to shed
light on issues such as
corruption in the media
and the American judi-
cial and criminal justice
systems. Joey does this
all without abandoning
his musical excellence
and his dedication to
bars and lyrical ability,
the lifeblood of real hip-
hop.

DAMN.
Kendrick Lamar
If you didn’t already
know that I would
pick Kendrick Lamar’s
DAMN. as my hip-hop
album of the year, then
you don’t really know
me at all.
For those who don’t
know, I am a Kendrick
stan. However, this
is not why DAMN. Is
2017’s best hip-hop al-
bum in my opinion. In
DAMN., Kendrick craft-
ed a masterpiece which
cemented his position
as the greatest rapper
alive. It is a completely
unique listening expe-
rience, almost serving
as an amalgamation of
the highs of his previ-
ous classic offerings,
Section 80, good kid,
m.A.A.d city” and To
Pimp a Butterfly.
DAMN. also sees Ken-
drick reinvent his
sound, moving away
from the jazz/funk in-
fluences of his previous
storytelling, conceptual
maintaining his artistic
integrity. The now dou-
ble-platinum DAMN. is
2017’s highest selling
album, shifting 603,000
units and debuting atop
the Billboard 200 chart
in its first week.
DAMN. feels like an in-
stant classic and, despite
the album dropping al-
most eight months ago,
I still stumble across the
subtle nuances hidden

“On 4:44,

albums and achieving
commercial success
with tracks like ‘LOY-
ALTY.’, ‘LOVE.’ and
‘HUMBLE.’, all while
beneath Kendrick’s del-
icately woven, dexter-
ous lyrics. For instance,
I’m still not sure what
he’s talking about when
he repeats “What hap-
pens on Earth stays on
Earth” throughout the
album or who the blind
woman on the album’s
intro track, ‘BLOOD.’
is meant to represent.
Maybe I’m not ‘woke’
enough to fully un-
derstand it yet. Maybe
Kendrick is trolling and
there actually isn’t a
deeper meaning or sym-
bolism behind some of
his lyrics. Who knows?
All I know is that this
album is exceptional.
It will be interesting to
see whether Kendrick
or Jay Z comes home
with the “Best Rap Al-
bum” and/or “Album of
the Year” 2018 Gram-
my for their respective
albums, but it’s obvious
which album would get
my vote.
