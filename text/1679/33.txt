O
n Friday 17th
November, the
sailing teams
Imperial Blue
(1st
) and White (2nd
) made
their way to compete
at the Welsh Dragon in
Cardiff. Having originally
intended to be at the
Birmingham event this
weekend, the last-minute
switch left the transport
somewhat confusing with
four arriving by car, seven
by coach and one by train!
The Welsh Dragon saw 24
teams racing in four flights
of boats sandwiched by
evening socials.
The coach journey took
significantly longer and
Aidan (social sec) led the
pre-drinks en route, whilst
everyone else had joined
all the other university
teams in the Vulcan at
the first of the two socials
planned for the weekend.
Despite arriving at
different times and loca-
tions, eventually everyone
found each other and
ended up at Retros where
the cheap drinks (£3.20
for a double vodka mixer)
caused us to boogie the
night away. Shout out
to a certain social sailor
(William Ray) who ended
the evening with his new
best friend (the toilet) who
witnessed the reappear-
before rushing to the
club for a 9.15 briefing.
Saturday saw breezy
conditions usually absent
from London’s Welsh
Harp Reservoir and the
teams battled their way
around the huge course.
Racing ran smoothly,
especially with on-
the-water changeovers
speeding everything up.
Damages saw one flight
drop to two boat team
racing and IC White won
a particularly tense race
against Wessex White
which could have gone
either way, with Oliver
Kidd having spins just
before the finish! IC Blue
won 5/6 races (losing only
to Wessex Red) and their
success meant that they
were in Gold Fleet for
Sunday racing, while IC
White placed in Platinum.
With racing finished
for the day, the teams had
time off to rest before the
highly anticipated 80s and
babies themed BYOB at
Vulcan after which they
were ushered off to Juice,
the Cardiff Union, to
complete the night!
Sunday racing was
postponed until 12pm
due to the lack of wind
but despite the ideal wind
conditions, team per-
formance was impaired
by hungover crews on
the first team. However,
IC Blue (Helms: Joe
Burgin, Gabriel Ing, Felix
Crowther; Crews: Calvin
also to IC White (Helms:
Oliver Kidd, Cobi Allen,
Aidan Bell; Crews:
Matilda Matthews,
Edward Brown, Michal
Wojnowski) who sailed
well against some very
tough teams. Special
mention goes to Cobi,
who managed to sail
to the wrong mark but
misled the other team in
the process.
Huge thanks to the
organisers Eve Gadd &
Jamie Catchpole and
everyone at Cardiff Uni-
versity Sailing Club for
running such a great event
and also to the Cardiff Bay
Yacht Club for having us.
Shout out to our lovely
host Sophie Hempsell for
having us (and sorry for
the vomit)!!!
