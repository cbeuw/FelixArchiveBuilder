Lubaina Himid crowned winner of the Turner Prize

T
he Turner Prize,
which celebrates
developments
in contemporary
British art, was awarded
to Lubaina Himid on
Tuesday night. Himid, 63,
is the oldest recipient of
the prestigious award, as
well as the first woman
of colour to be given the
honour. Widely expected
to win for her work that
focuses on promoting the
stories and voices of the
African diaspora through
drawings, printmaking
and installations, Himid’s
win was made possible by
the lifting of the age re-
striction that has prevent-
ed artists over 50 years old
from winning in previous
years. It is speculated that
another rule change may
have benefited Himid:
for the first time, the ex-
hibition the artist curates
specifically for the Turner
Prize was taken into
consideration. This meant
that Himid was judged not
only on her contribution
to contemporary art in
the past twelve months
– as has been the case
previously – but also the
mini-retrospective of her
work that she displayed at
the Ferens Gallery in Hull,
where the prize-giving
took place.
The judges remarked
particularly on A Fashion-
able Marriage – a piece
Himid created in 1986
inspired by the tableau of
characters in Hogarth’s
Marriage a la Mode. The
inclusion of Margaret
Thatcher and Ronald
Reagan as flirting lovers
dates the piece, but its
exploration of politics, the
judges felt, was “resonant
and relevant” today. Other
pieces of note included in
the exhibition was a series
of pages torn from The
Guardian that Himid has
worked on for many years.
In painting over sections
of the newspaper’s pages
Himid highlights the
interplay between the
headlines and the accom-
panying (often unrelated)
pictures of black people.
The juxtaposition of
these elements, Himid
argues, cements uncon-
scious racial stereotypes
– drawing caricatures of
black people as victims
and perpetrators of
violence, imagery par-
ticularly potent as black
people are rarely visible
in other contexts in the
mainstream media.
Himid, who was
brought up in Lancashire
and works in Preston, but
was born in Zanzibar,
Tanzania to a black father
and a white mother, has
made a career of making
black lives more visible.
In Naming the Money,
which she conceived of
in 2004 and was exhibited
this year in the Museum
of Modern Art in Oxford
and Spike Island in Bristol
– the shows that earned
her the Turner prize nom-
ination – Himid seeks to
draw out forgotten figures
from history and set them
apart from the monolith
that the word ‘slaves’
constructs. For this work
Himid has constructed
over 100 life-size cut-outs,
each a representation of a
slave. The figures, dressed
in brightly coloured
finery, and engaged in all
sorts of different pursuits,
from playing musical in-
struments to playing with
puppies, each have ac-
companying text – written
by and read aloud by
Himid – gallery goers can
listen to on a soundtrack,
this text gives two names
to each figure, the one
they were born with, and
a second they were given
by their owners. As the
viewer moves through
the exhibition, each
figure explains what they
did before being sold,
and what they do now
as an enslaved person.
Allowing these figures
to give a sense of their
history before they got on
the boat that would take
them to the West returns
their dignity to them.
The exuberance, the joy
of these figures dressed
up in flamboyant patterns
and jewel colours is im-
portant too. Himid is not
interested in “replaying
their trauma”, but wants
instead to celebrate their
resilience, their capacity
to beautify the world
around them despite the
atrocities committed
against them – “they are
stronger than history, that
is the point. My figures
say: ‘You tell me your
story, I’ll tell you mine’”
she said, speaking to The
Guardian prior to her win
on Tuesday.
Ironically, Himid, in
her pursuit of making
other more visible has
gone rather unrecognised
herself. Himid was
“thrilled” to win, and
thanked her long-time
supporters saying “to the
art and cultural historians
who cared enough to write
essays about my work for
decades - thank you, you
gave me sustenance in
the wilderness years.”
She speculated that she
may not have received
more mainstream acclaim
because the public were
not ready to receive her
work until recently and
the subjects she tackled
were too “complex,
many-layered” to sell
newspapers.
Alex Farquharson,
the director of Tate
Britain, and the chair of
the judging panel, said
that Himid’s win was a
reminder of the fact “that
artists can experience
a breakthrough in their
work at any age”.
Himid hopes the Prize,
worth £25,000 previously
won by Steve McQueen,
Damien Hirst, and
Grayson Perry, amongst
others, will give her the
prominence to work with
more artists. As for the
money, she’ll be using
it to commission fellow
artists perhaps, or buy a
new pair of shoes.
The Tanzanian-born artist who amplifies the stories of people of the African diaspora is the oldest-ever winner of
the prestigious award celebrating contemporary British art.

Seeing the world differently: art drained of colour
M
o n o -
c h r o m e
at the
National
Gallery explores mono-
chrome paintings through
time, spanning seven
centuries and displaying
50 works of art. The exhi-
bition follows a thematic
sequence, with some clear
gems but a lack of direc-
tion, rescued by a twist at
the end.
The first section
displays works from the
Middle Ages to the 17th
century with a Biblical
theme. At this period in
time coloured artworks
were seen to be decadent
and distracting, greyscale
paintings were seen
as a more appropriate
backdrop to meditation
and devotion. Other uses
of greyscale in biblical art
and sacred art included
depicting Christ’s Passion
or the martyrdom of the
saints. The absence of
colour was also used to
contrast the Old Testament
with the New Testament,
presenting Christianity as
incomplete without the
colour of Christ.
Others painted in
monochrome to explore
light and shadow before
they created their final
coloured versions. In the
third section, independent
artworks in their own right
are revisited, again most
have sacred themes. In the
following sections, mono-
chrome paintings used to
prepare designs for, and
later mimic sculpture and
media are displayed. The
most striking example dis-
played is Jacob De Wit’s
Jupiter and Ganymede
(1739), which without
the shadows created
by artificial light in the
gallery could easily be
mistaken for marble. The
result requires you to look
twice - delivering a sort
of punchline at second
glance.
The effect of more
modern technologies on
monochrome paintings
are then explored. Con-
trasting the photorealistic
sculpture are obscured
works, often alongside or
inspired by photographs,
such as Chuck Close’s
Joel. Where monochrome
versions provided a new
dimension to coloured
paintings in the 18th
and
19th
centuries, paint is now
used to abstract images
represented with photo-
graphs and film. While
there are some beautiful
works in this section and
those preceding it, the
vibe of the exhibition is at
times dry and exhausting-
ly technical. Finally there
is relief in abstract artwork
including Malevich’s
iconic Black Square.
Only at this point does the
exhibition start to come
together as a coherent ex-
perience, albeit somewhat
disjointed.
The final room is an
art installation, which
upon entering looks like
nothing special – an empty
room with orange lights.
Soon it becomes apparent
that what makes it special
is that it is solely that – an
empty room with orange
lights. Given that there
is only one frequency of
light in the room, colours
can’t be seen or deci-
phered, and everything
is blanketed in greyscale.
The experience is discon-
certing, and other details
seem sharper. It seems
without the interference
of colour details are more
intense and vision more
vivid. Looking at your
own hands with the colour
drained from them feels
Odalisque in Grisaille // Jean-Auguste-Domonique Ingres and workshop
“Without the
interference of
colour details
are more
intense, and
vision more
vivid” like being transported into
a film. While you are en-
couraged to take and share
photographs and share
them #SeeDifferently,
the effects aren’t as clear
when captured. Any RGB
detection from a basic
camera upsets the white
balance and the image
is different from the one
relayed by our eyes. The
effect of colour, and our
reliance on it to under-
stand and punctuate our
surroundings suddenly
becomes a huge question.
