For your consideration: the first annual Felix Film
The Film Editors have cast their ballots. We are proud to present the 2017 winners of this year’s inaugural Felix

A
s the year
winds to a
close, in lieu
of compiling a
list of the best films, di-
rectorial work and acting
performances, we have
decided to hand out prizes
to those who merit them
for their outstanding cre-
ative efforts. We imagine
that the finest talents in
world cinema are sat at
the edge of their seats in
anticipation, hoping that
they are fortunate enough
to earn a career-defining
commemoration from us.
There are no red carpets
or golden statuettes, but
welcome to the inaugural
Felix Film Awards.
(Note: Only films with
UK theatrical release dates
in 2017 were eligible)
Best Picture
Call Me By Your Name
Get Out
Moonlight
The Florida Project
The Handmaiden
2017 was a very strong
year for film. To narrow
down the nominees to just
five was challenging. To
choose a winner excru-
ciating. In the end, Park
Chan-Wook’s erotic, psy-
chological thriller, period
drama (yes, you read that
right) came out on top. Ex-
quisitely crafted, bravely
acted and grippingly
paced, The Handmaiden is
perhaps Park’s crowning
achievement ahead of the
brilliant Oldboy. This is a
completely original work
of art, and the fact that
South Korea chose The
Age of Shadows as its sub-
mission for the Academy
Award for Best Foreign
Language Film ahead
of The Handmaiden is a
travesty worthy of a jaw
drop almost as big as the
ones you will experience
throughout this film.
Best Director
Sean Baker (The
Florida Project)
Luca Guadagnino (Call
Me by Your Name)
Barry Jenkins (Moon-
light)
Christopher Nolan
(Dunkirk)
Park Chan-Wook
(The Handmaiden)
When choosing which
director you might have
to adapt Fingersmith, a
Sarah Waters crime drama
that is absolutely steeped
in its setting of Victorian
England, Korean director
Park Chan-Wook might
not immediately spring
to mind. But scratch
under the surface, and the
decision makes perfect
sense: Fingersmith is
no novel of genteel
Victoriana, but a gritty
and dark narrative that
revels in violence and
black humour – two of
Park’s trademarks. With
The Handmaiden, Park
not only manages to
somehow keep the spirit
of Waters’ novel alive –
despite shifting the action
to Japanese-occupied
Korea – but also adds
his own directorial nous.
Delicately balancing a
tricky script, which leaves
the audience reeling, with
a tightly-controlled visual
language, Park has made
one of the finest works in
his career.
Best Actor
Casey Affleck (Man-
chester by the Sea)
Timothée Chalamet
(Call Me by Your Name)
James Franco (The
Disaster Artist)
Jean-Pierre Léaud (La
Mort de Louis XIV)
Adrian Titieni (Gradu-
ation)
When an actor is young,
it can be tempting to filter
anything they do through
their youth. Good, solid
performances can be
propelled to stratospheric
heights if the person deliv-
ering those lines is under
the age of thirty, perhaps
because we expect great
performances to only
come with experience.
For Timothée Chalamet,
however, the star of sim-
mering romance Call Me
by Your Name, the hype
is justified. At the tender
age of 21, Chalamet has
delivered a performance
that is nuanced and re-
strained, one that manages
to convey the agonies and
tribulations of young love
and desire.
Best Actress
Sonia Braga (Aquarius)
Rebecca Hall (Chris-
tine)
Isabelle Huppert
(Elle)
Kim Min-Hee (The
Handmaiden)
Natalie Portman
(Jackie)
Isabelle Huppert has
won multiple César
Awards, a Golden Globe
and the Best Actress
award at all of the tradi-
tional big three festivals
(Berlin, Cannes, Venice).
Though she was robbed
of the Academy Award
earlier this year, she has
now reached the pinnacle
of her career in winning
the Felix Award for best
actress. She can finally
retire happy, a wonderful
career complete. Her
performance in Elle is a
devastating tour-de-force
that needs to be seen to be
believed. 2017 was a phe-
nomenal year for leading
actress performances, and
while the other nominees
are all tremendous,
Huppert showed once
again that she is just on
another level to everyone
else.
Best Supporting Ac-
tor
Mahershala Ali (Moon-
light)
Willem Dafoe (The
Florida Project)
Jason Mitchell
(Mudbound)
Michael Stulhbarg
(Call Me by Your Name)
Jean-Louis Trintignant
(Happy End)
This is a category for
the unsung heroes of
cinema, often made up

Awards for 2017
of young actors not quite
ready to carry a film, and
older actors deemed past
their peak of marketabil-
ity. Jason Mitchell is a
young up-and-comer who
has used the buzz off of
his strong turn in Straight
Outta Compton to appear
in three very acclaimed
films this year (Detroit,
The Disaster Artist and
Mudbound). Mahershala
Ali’s career is on the
rise too, having won the
Academy Award for the
very same performance
he is nominated for here.
Jean-Louis Trintignant
is the old hand, a legend
of French cinema still
going strong into his late
80s. Michael Stulhbarg
is a wonderful actor who
shines across a number
of this year’s awards
contenders in The Post,
The Shape of Water,
and Call Me By Your
Name. The latter is his
big break (after his last
big break in his Golden
Globe-nominated turn for
A Serious Man). Yet it is
another underappreciated
veteran, Willem Dafoe,
who takes this one for his
nuanced and grounded
role as a warm yet stern
motel manager. He is
amongst the favourites for
the upcoming Academy
Awards.
Best Supporting Ac-
tress
Greta Gerwig (20th
Century Women)
Naomie Harris (Moon-
light)
Kim Tae-Ri (The
Handmaiden)
Carey Mulligan
(Mudbound)
Michelle Williams
(Manchester by the Sea)
Playing one character
can be difficult enough,
but in The Handmaiden
Kim Tae-Ri – who makes
her feature film debut –
plays a Russian doll of
a role. As Sook-hee, the
eponymous handmaiden
of the film, Kim goes
through various levels of
subterfuge, and we are
never quite sure what is
an act and what is reality.
Kim manages to keep the
audience going along with
her journey throughout all
the twists and turns con-
tained within The Hand-
maiden, which is no small
feat. An actor playing
an actor, Kim takes on a
meta-role that is not quite
matched by any of the
other nominees, making
her a worthy winner of the
prize.
Best Adapted Screen-
play
Armando Iannucci &
David Schneider & Ian
Martin & Peter Fellows
(The Death of Stalin)
James Ivory (Call Me
by Your Name)
Barry Jenkins (Moon-
light)
Park Chan-Wook &
Chung Seo-Kyung (The
Handmaiden)
Virgil Williams and
Dee Rees (Mudbound)
The great Stanley
Kubrick once said that
in order to make a great
film, one needed a great
book on which to base it.
While history has shown
that many great films have
literature, and retaining its
message while cutting bits
out or changing things is
a treacherous tightrope to
walk. James Ivory does
this remarkably well with
Andre Aciman’s Call Me
by Your Name, writing
a beautiful adaptation
that is in keeping with
the original novel, while
offering a unique cine-
matic quality. The result is
so good Aciman himself
claims it is better than his
novel. Ivory was initially
supposed to direct this
work, but can be satisfied
with his writing.
Best Original Screen-
play
Maren Ade (Toni
Erdmann)
Yorgos Lanthimos &
Efthymis Filippou (The
Killing of a Sacred Deer)
Kenneth Lonergan
(Manchester by the Sea)
Mike Mills (20th
Century Women)
Jordan Peele (Get Out)
Original screenplays
saw what was perhaps
their heyday in the ‘90s,
with seven figure spec
sales almost a regular
occurrence. They have
begun to make a resur-
gence in recent years, and
this was a particularly
tight category, with a
diverse set of nominees
so different to each other.
In the end Maren Ade’s
Toni Erdmann triumphed
over the incumbent
Academy Award-winning
script amongst others
to claim the prestigious
Felix Award. Ade’s
unconventional comedy
is ostensibly about the
relationship between an
up-tight career-obsessed
young woman and her
carefree, juvenile father,
a subject underexplored
by cinema historically. In
the background are deeper
issues about gender
discrimination in the
workplace and the hollow
nature of capitalist greed,
all interwoven beautifully
with a bizarre humour
derived from a wholly
original premise.
Best Cinematography
Chung Chung-Hoon
(The Handmaiden)
Roger Deakins (Blade
Runner 2049)
James Laxton (Moon-
light)
Linus Sandgren (La La
Land)
Hoyte van Hoytema
(Dunkirk)
There were a number of
beautifully shot films this
year, many of which did
not even make the list of
nominees. We have seen
different projects using
film, be it 16mm, 35mm
or even 70mm, all to great
Sean Baker (The
Florida Project)
Tom Cross (La La
Land)
Kim Jae-Bum & Kim
Sang-Bum (The Hand-
maiden)
Nat Sanders and Joi
McMillon (Moonlight)
Lee Smith (Dunkirk)
Cast your mind back
to great films by the likes
of someone like Robert
Bresson, and it is clear
that the editing is so good
because you don’t notice
it’s there. Tom Cross’ col-
laborations with Damien
Chazelle have been the
complete opposite, and
that demonstrates the good
editing is about aiding
the story. Where Bresson
demanded the attention
to be on intimate details,
Chazelle has shown
himself to be extremely
flashy since his break-
through with Whiplash.
That was a masterclass is
fast cutting sequences to
maintain a relentless pace.
La La Land is a sweeping
musical with a number of
single take song and dance
numbers, and Tom Cross
is able to keep the sense
of nostalgia while adding
a modern, dynamic edge.
Best Score
Nicholas Britell
(Moonlight)
Jo Yeong-Wook (The
Handmaiden)
Mica Levi (Jackie)
Oneohtrix Point Never
(Good Time)
Hans Zimmer
(Dunkirk)
First comment on this
category: La La Land,
which took home the
Academy Award, has
good songs, but not much
of a score. There is a dif-
ference. The score is there
to aid the vision of the
director, and add layers
to the narrative. Zimmer’s
machine-like sounds add
to the sense of suspense
in Dunkirk, the wonder-
fully named Oneohtrix
Point Never’s electronic
vibes drive gritty heist
thriller Good Time, and
Britell and Jo’s work
on Moonlight and The
Handmaiden respectively
are just regal. That being
said, the way in which
Mica Levi’s score for
Jackie accompanies Pablo
Larrain’s tight close-ups
to create a claustrophobia
leaves the viewer barely
able to breathe, just as
Jackie Kennedy was in
the days after her husband
JFK was assassinated in
front of the nation.
Best Documentary
Cameraperson
City of Ghosts
I Am Not Your Negro
I Called Him Morgan
Tower
Documentaries are not
normally associated with
the theatre in the same
way that big costume
dramas or high octane
action films are. This has
led to Netflix becoming
perhaps the strongest
distributor of non-fiction
film, for those seeking
something enlightening
when they stay in on a cold
night, or unwind after a
hard day’s work. I Am Not
Your Negro smashes this
pattern to smithereens,
managing to take almost
$10 million in the States
alone against a $1 million
budget. This is a crucial
incendiary meditation on
race relations in America.
“Doing justice
to a piece of
literature is a
treacherous
tightrope
to walk, but
James Ivory
does it with
skill”
been made from original
concepts, a great book
can be a solid foundation
from which to work from.
That being said, properly
doing justice to a piece of
“Roger
Deakins is
one of the all-
time greats
of modern
cinema”
effect, while many have
shown that digital really
is a viable option for con-
juring beautiful images.
It would be wrong to
give this award to anyone
other than Roger Deakins
though. The man is one
of the all-time greats, and
has mystifyingly never
once won the Academy
Award from his thirteen
nominations, for titles
that include Fargo, No
Country for Old Men
and The Assassination
of Jesse James by the
Coward Robert Ford.
He is the favourite for
this year’s award for
his astonishing work on
Blade Runner 2049, but
if he is indeed snaked
once again, he will at
least have a Felix Award
to console him.
Best Editing

Levi’s score

ups leaves
