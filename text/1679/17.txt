Top albums of 2017, Adrian’s picks
Honourable mentions go to St. Vincent, Public Service Broadcasting and King Krule. And let’s not forget both Liam
and Noel Gallagher who, in the face of adversity, managed to regain some semblance of relevance.

The Flaming Lips
Tucked away at the
beginning of the year
was the 14th album by
psychedelic veterans The
Flaming Lips. Blending
rock and electronica, this
colourful LP is a neatly
produced experimental
piece that, despite the
many references to
unicorns and a bizarre
feature by Miley Cyrus,
retains a bewildering
coherence. After pushing
musical boundaries for 34
years now, Wayne Coyne
& co. are still leading
the pack with no signs of
slowing down.

Interplanetary Class
Classics
The Moonlandingz
Pugnacious, scuzzy
and lewd is the debut
album by this side
project, consisting of
members from Fat White
Family and Eccentronic
Research Council. With
help from Sean Lennon
& Yoko Ono, we’re
treated to 41 minutes of
cascading synths, exhila-
rating cynicism and Iggy
Pop-esque snarls.
8
Lotta Sea Lice
Courtney Barnett &
Kurt Vile
As Felix reported at
the time, this collabora-
tive album doesn’t quite
capture the full frenetic
wit of Barnett’s solo
work, nor is it the intri-
cate, immersive daydream
that we’ve come to expect
from Vile. It is, however,
soaked in the playful
intimacy of two friends
and artists, working
together to produce some-
thing fun, sentimental and
wholesome.
7
Migration
Bonobo
By far his most so-
phisticated work to date,
Bonobo’s world-influ-
enced electronica is crisp
and finessed. Construct-
ing serene, atmospheric
soundscapes comes
naturally to Simon Green
at this point, and he does
it better than anyone else.
6
Antisocialites
Alvvays
Dropping some of
the teenage insecurities
of their first album, the
sophomore effort by the
Canadian cuties is still
fun and delicate indie
pop, but with a newfound
confidence and wisdom.
Compelling from start to
finish, this brisk record
cements the five-piece as
ones to watch.
5
Slowdive
Slowdive
Over the course of the
22 years since shoegaze
darlings Slowdive were
panned by critics and
dropped from their record
label, they’ve amassed
a greater following than
they’d ever experienced
previously. The first
of two big comeback
albums on this list was a
gargantuan sonic assault,
reminiscent of their early
work but in the format of
a more conventional rock
LP. Turbulent and tender,
this is an album made
for live shows; as such,
they underwent an exten-
sive and well-attended
tour, culminating in a
wildly impressive gig at
Camden’s roundhouse.

The Weather
Pond
These Australian
psych-rockers first came
into being as something
of a Tame Impala side
project, with multiple
members shared between
the two bands. Though
fully autonomous, Pond
has been generally
overshadowed by their
parent outfit, and so has
existed largely under the
radar. This latest effort,
however, is an absolute
standout. With Tame
Impala frontman Kevin
Parker lending a hand on
production, the LP is a
shimmering whirlwind
with incredible energy.
Dystopian visions of the
band’s hometown, Perth,
are seen through a kalei-
doscopic lens, sporting
anguish and amazement
in equal measure.

V
The Horrors
More muscular than
we’ve previously seen
them, the dream-pop
quintet from Southend-
on-Sea have adopted a
new sound on this, their
fifth full length outing.
Rousing new wave with a
familiar Human League/
OMD vibe punctuates
their distinctive indus-
trial drone, resulting in
something that is both
danceable and disturbing.
Opaque and unrelenting, it
may have lost some of the
artsy innocence of their
previous work, but my
god, does it sound good.
2
American Dream
LCD Soundsystem
There’s always the
worry that a return after
hiatus as highly anticipat-
ed as this one is going to
underwhelm, and so very
often it does. However,
this was not true of LCD.
As Felix reported, this is
some of the most stellar
work we’ve seen from
JamesMurphyandfriends.
Brooding, reflective and
littered with homages
to their musical heroes,
this nearly faultless LP
showed that though they
may be getting on a bit,
they’re still nowhere near
losing their edge.

A Deeper Understand-
ing
The War on Drugs
The massive critical
acclaim of 2014’s Lost
in the Dream set the bar
desperately high. Produc-
ing a follow up that could
match it must’ve seemed
a nigh on impossible
task for the Philadelphia
misfits. Adam Granduc-
iel’s response was to
retreat into the studio for
three years of meticulous
crafting. The result didn’t
match their earlier effort,
it surpassed it, with
ease. To dismiss them as
Springsteen-esque Dad
rock is demeaning; while
their inspirations may be
rooted in the mid-80s,
they’re in no way rehash-
ing that scene. Sublime,
extended guitar play hints
at big riffs but seldom
realises them, creating in-
tricate, effervescent layers
of sound that submerge
and consume you,
superbly engineered with
great depth and clarity. If
the previous LP was an
ethereal dream, this one is
an otherworldly reality.
