beginning to use more
elaborate methods.
Over the past two
months, 14 thefts have
been reported to security
services across all Im-
perial campuses, a sharp
increase from the four
thefts reported the two
months prior. In total,
since January 47 cycle
crimes have been reported
to security.

as course material,
following a complaint
made by a student that
it “referred to women in

an offensive way”.
The video, which was
used in a Managerial Eco-
nomic module, was taken
down earlier this week,
with students being in-
formed of the decision on
December 4th
. The video
in question was from the
2001 film A Beautiful
Mind, and featured a
group of men using game
theory to ensure that they
“all get laid”; mathemati-
cian John Nash (Russell
Crowe) advises his
friends that if they “all go
for the blonde” then “not
a single one of us is going
to get her.” It was used
as an attempt to explain
the Nash Equilibrium, a
concept in game theory.

complaint], and had it
replaced immediately.”
Speaking to Felix,
Fintan O'Connor, Deputy
President (Welfare), said
that he was “pleased that
the College has taken
a strong stance on the
content it deems appro-
priate for a teaching envi-
ronment”, but highlighted
that he was “even more
pleased by the example
it shows – that a single
student can challenge
unacceptable behaviour,
and make a difference to
Imperial’s culture for the
better.”
Veloso similarly stated
that the student coming
forward was “an attitude
and form of behaviour that
I would like to encourage
among all our students
and staff.”
In a statement, a
College spokesperson
said that they were “very
sorry indeed for any
offence caused. It is very
much neither the culture
nor the behaviour we
aspire to at Imperial, and
an apology has been sent
to all students who saw
the video.”
They went on to say that
“as part of the new Learn-
ing and Teaching Strategy
the Business School and
the College are already
developing a variety of
initiatives to make our
undergraduate and post-
graduate curricula more
inclusive in terms of both
the research content and
teaching, and we are also
looking at our current
procedures around how
we handle complaints
from students.”
Imperial has stated
that, as part of their
commitments to equal-
ity, they will “create a
culture where all staff and
students feel valued and
respected”.
thieves due to them being
secured with inferior
cable type locks”, and
recommend purchasing
a stronger lock, such as
a D-lock or heavy duty
chain.
However, thieves have
been using more elaborate
methods to get to bikes: on
Friday 24th
November, a
staff member had her bike
stolen on South Kensing-
ton campus by two thieves
who used a grinder to cut
through the lock. CCTV
footage showed the theft
occurred at 10.30am,
and both suspects were
wearing balaclavas.
The bike, which was a
Brompton model, was
worth around £1,000. The
incident has been reported
to the police, and images
of the suspects passed on.
One student Felix
spoke to, who had their
bike stolen in May of this
year from opposite the
Skempton Building, was
using the D-lock sold by
campus security, which
they said was “as good as
useless when it came to se-
curing my bike”. Security
informed the student the
total time for the theft was
under a minute.
South Kensington
campus currently has
a number of areas for
bicycle parking, with
space for approximately
1500 bikes. However,
around 500 of these spaces
are not access-controlled,
A number of staff and
students have recom-
mended parking space
underneath the Faculty
Building be converted
into secure storage. Cur-
rently, the Faulty bicycle
store has space for nearly
600 bicycles, and some
have suggested convert-
ing areas within the same
complex used as parking
spaces to bicycle stores
would negate some of the
issues around space.
Dr Bradley Ladewig,
a senior lecturer in the
Department of Chemical
Engineering, has said
that "having a safe and
secure bicycle storage
space that would benefit
several hundred staff and
students each day is more
important than parking for
a maximum of 17 staff (no
students)"
Official advice from
College security is to “use
heavy duty chains or ‘A’
graded D locks”, since
”criminals will remove
inferior locks such as disc
locks in seconds.” Securi-
ty sell to staff and students
at a discount – £35 instead
of £90. In their advice,
they highlight: “crimi-
nals are highly likely to
increase their activities
this time of year.” Secu-
rity recommend reporting
anyone loitering around
cycle parks by phoning

such as the stands in Beit

for space also seems to
outstrip demand, with
sources reporting bicycles
chained to inappropriate
places, such as gas bottle
cages.
