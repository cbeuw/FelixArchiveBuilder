Likewise, Oslo and Be-
ginning were successful
shows at the National
Theatre – Oslo is already
at the West End, and
the sold-out Beginning
will begin its stint at the
Ambassadors Theatre in
January next year.
I learnt the most from
the Dalí/Duchamp
retrospective that is still
running at the Royal
Academy of Art. Having
studied both before and
being a fan of Dalí, I was
interested to know what
they had in common.
Perhaps this is a late
realisation, but I learnt
that the two were close
friends, often staying at
each other’s residence
when visiting and in
regular correspondence.
The exhibition was
brilliantly curated, with
works on similar themes
placed next to each other,
allowing viewers to
clearly see their influence
on each other’s art.
In general, this has been
a good year for theatre –
shows of high standard
that continue to run at the
West End, blockbuster
productions that are
relevant to the political
climate. But happily, this
has also been a good year
for art exhibitions – shows
that are well-curated and
tell a good story. Let’s see
if this trend continues in
2018.

T
his year was
meant to save us
from what was
generally agreed
to be the worst year ever,
2016, and in some ways
it has (fewer beloved
celebrities went to the
Hollywood in the sky), in
other ways of course, it’s
been equally as terrible
– we’ve needed some
quality distraction. Pure
escapism however has not
been on the card, In these
increasingly political
times, the art world too
seems to have gotten more
political.
The Tate’s blockbuster
show Soul of a Nation:
Art in the Age of Black
Power, a highlight of the
summer, put a spotlight on
the entrenched racism of
the Civil Rights Era, and
particularly with regards
to the art created in
response to acts of police
brutality, drew parallels
to the present day – high-
lighting how far America
has come, and how much
farther it still has to go.
Betye Saar’s assemblages
were some of the most
powerful of the show – in
one particularly haunting
piece entitled I’ve Got
Rhythm the skeleton of a
lynched black man swung
in a coffin-like metro-
nome case lined with a
(real) newspaper clipping
that explained the man’s
fate – hanged for refusing
to dance. It’s wasn’t all
tragedy and rage – Barkley
L. Hendrick’s self-portrait
on aluminium Icon for My
Man Superman was effer-
vescently cool, grounded
both in the religious
iconography of medieval
art and present day pop
culture. Its’ irreverence
and wry observations
were echoed in the works
displayed at the Tate
Britain for Queer British
Art 1861-1967. In equal
parts poignant and joyous,
the exhibition was an ode
to the constantly evolving
queer communities and
the wider society that has
evolved around them.
The curation did well to
put the works in context,
with detailed notes about
the artists and the events
surrounding the work
accompanying each piece,
for many of the pieces
on display, the stories
behind the works alone
were worth the price of
admission.
Just as 2017 has proved
a good year for the visual
arts, it has been a vintage
yearforLondon’stheatres.
Special mentions must go
to Oslo, the play about
the eponymous Accords
that brought peace to the
Middle East (for a time),
and the Norwegian couple
that masterminded it, was
masterful, managing to
weave a tense yarn from
a complex bit of political
history. We might’ve
expected it to be a bit of
a thriller, but it was also
surprisingly funny, the
laugh-out-loud moments
elevating an already
engaging performance.
Beginnings, also at the
National Theatre dealt
with more personal
politics. Now at the Am-
bassadors Theatre after a
swift West End transfer,
it signalled a triumphant
return for playwright
David Eldridge, who, in
this achingly funny but
wonderfully tender play,
explores love in the age of
Tinder with a Tennessee
Williams-esque incisive-
ness.
The arts event of
the year for me goes to
another NT production.
Tony Kushner’s ‘gay
fantasia’ about the AIDS
crisis, Angels in America
boasted a star-studded cast
in Nathan Lane, Andrew
Garfield, and Russell
Tovey, but it was their
lesser known co-stars,
Nathan Stewart-Jarrett
and Denise Gough, who
stole the show as Belize
and Harper respectively
– pathos dripped from
both their performances –
when Garfield’s delivery
got a bit too overblown,
Stewart-Jarrett grounded
it with sublime natural-
ism. Kushner’s script:
meditative, and lyrical
– sweeping across time
and space, from Heaven
to New York to Antarcti-
ca, and back again – was
a call to arms when it was
first performed. The NT’s
superb restaging was
a reminder that twenty
years later, Kushner’s
voice is just as potent.

I
t’s a strange feeling,
when you feel like
you know an artist,
that you have a rea-
sonable understanding of
his work, to then discover
him afresh. But exactly
what I experienced at Tate
Britain in February, when
the gallery put on the
largest ever arrangement
of Hockney’s work.
David Hockney, The
Exhibition, followed the
artist’s work from his
earliest days as a student
to his 2016 iPad drawings.
Here, backlit screens
display not only the final
product but also the evolu-
tion of the drawings in the
form of screen-captured
videos. It’s rare to have
the opportunity to see any
artist’s mind in action,
let alone one of Britain’s
great modern painters.
Of course, many of
Hockney’s most famous
works were on display:
A Bigger Splash (1967),
American Collectors
(1968), Mr and Mrs Clark
and Percy (1970-1), Pear-
blossom Hwy. (1986). But
the real enjoyment came
from discovering for the
first time – along with, I
imagine, everyone else
in the room – his smaller
pieces and sketches that
later found life in his mas-
terpieces. Stumbling upon
a small piece of triangular
graph paper, on which
Hockney had sketched a
crude palm tree and car
– aptly titled The Great
Pyramid with Palm Tree
and Car (1963) – only
to later realise it served
as the draft for his great
Great Pyramid at Giza
with Broken Head from
Thebes later that year
instilled in me a boyish
sense of adventure. I was
essentially an art detective
for a few hours, which
means I was essentially
Inspector Clouseau. Pretty
cool, huh?
Where do I begin with
my theatre highlight of the
year: Roman Tragedies
was an experience like
no other Let me set the
scene: Enobarbus, Mark
Antony’s closest confi-
dant has just betrayed
the great Roman general.
So overcome with grief
is he with his actions, he
dcides to take his own life.
His cries and pleas for
forgiveness are translated
from Dutch to English
courtesy of surtitles. A
cameraman follows him
as he stumbles across
the stage; his lamenting
projected above the set for
the audience gawk over.
Suddenly, he exits
stage left and proceeds to
bound up the stairs, past
the stalls, cameraman in
pursuit. The live video
feed continues as Enobar-
bus meanders out of the
Barbican onto the road.
As he continues to confess
his sins, a member of the
public appears on the
footpath. He is carrying
his shopping and stops
dead at the sight of man
rolling in the tarmac,
yelling in Dutch. The
camera zooms in on the
perplexed face of the pas-
ser-by, to the joy of every
member of the audience.
Eventually, Enobarbus
returns to the stage, still
in hysterics, where he
proceeds to end his suffer-
ing. “Enobarbus 81 – 31
BC” reads the caption, as
a bird’s-eye view of the
general’s body is met with
raucous applause.
Going into this one, I
wasn’tsurewhattoexpect.
A 6-hour-long, modern
day adaptation of Corio-
lanus, Julius Caesar, and
Antony and Cleopatra, all
in Dutch (with English
surtitles, thank God), and
the ability to walk onto
the stage during the per-
formance. So, just a little
strange then.
It was surreal, no doubt,
but Roman Tragedies was
also the most incredible
theatrical performance I
have ever had the joy of
witnessing. The adapta-
tions were set in a sprawl-
ing political conference
room, with declarations
of war framed as heated
debates. TV screens were
adorned with footage
from real world news, and
rolling headlines filled
the audience in on action
that has had to be skipped
in the interest of time.
Cameras – both manned
and stationary - followed
the actors wherever they
went, providing an essen-
tial perspective into the
action when the characters
find themselves buried in a
sea of audience members.
It was like watching a par-
ticularly intense episode
of The Thick of It, live.
So much occurred
during the six hours, it is
impossible to praise every
superbly planned and
executed element. Nor
was it possible to witness
them all; each audience
member chose to view
the show differently, and
each audience member’s
experience was unique.
Toneelgroep Amster-
dam stage performances
of Roman Tragedies at
various venues every
year. If you ever get the
opportunity to see it for
yourself, do not (do not!)
pass it by.

T
his year saw the
arrival of several
b l o c k b u s t e r
shows and ex-
hibitions, most notably
Angels in America,
which undoubtedly was
the best show I’ve seen
this year by far. Lavishly
extending across a two-
part show, with regular
tickets sold out days after
they were released, Angels
in America was certainly
the National Theatre’s
flagship show of 2017.
Not to mention Andrew
Garfield’s incredible per-
formance. A production
of Tony Kushner’s AIDS
drama, one that champi-
ons a progressive society
and rejects marginalisa-
tion, resonates even more
in a difficult year like this,
following 2016. As far as
art exhibitions are con-
cerned, Basquiat: Boom
for Real was an adven-
turous undertaking by
the Barbican, significant
because it is the first time
that the young artist’s (he
died age 27 of a heroin
overdose) body of work
has been shown all in one
place. Revolving around
different aspects of his
life and the post-punk,
hip-hop, street art culture
of which his work is a
part of, the exhibition is
a snapshot of Manhattan
in the last 1970s from a
unique perspective, in a
riot of colours and ideas.
Speaking of colours,
Casanova was a brilliant
ballet by the Northern
Ballet, which travelled
across the UK from Leeds
(where they are based)
to London to Edinburgh.
Ostentatious and grand,
this ballet pulled out all
the stops on a magnificent
set, colourful costumes
and intricate props. The
Northern Ballet special-
ises in ballet that tells
a story – and indeed,
this production told the
epic story of seductive
Casanova very well,
weaving complex visual
narration with perfect
choreography.
This year also saw
several transfers to the
West End of successful
shows by the National
Theatre and Royal
Court – The Ferryman
was transferred after an
immensely successful
sold out run at the Royal
Court. I was surprised to
see it doing so well and
thriving on the West End,
given its gravity and so-
cio-political themes – not
a light-hearted or heart-
warming story by any
measure. Nevertheless, I
enjoyed it for being just
that: serious, and tackling
a problematic history with
sensitivity. Its massive
cast was delightful, as
were the real animals and
babies on stage. Nothing
could prepare one for the
Roman tragedies at the Barbican//Jan Versweyveld
