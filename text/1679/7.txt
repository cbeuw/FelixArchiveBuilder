Theresa, what’s good? Our round up of the
For most of humankind, 2017 has been an awful year for politics. For satirists and political
commentators, it has been an absolute gift. Here are some of the best bits.

“One year
into Trump,
and we’re still
alive”
“Easiest [negotia-
tions] in history”
– Liam Fox, interna-
tional trade secretary
(Brexit)
Nine months have
passed since Article 50
was triggered. In that
time, David Davis has
done 30 days of work,
Theresa May has begged
EU leaders to take pity on
her, and everyone at home
has been slowly losing
the will to live. Where are
we now? Pretty much the
same place we were when
we started. The divorce
bill seems fairly settled at
around £40 billion (as the
EU always demanded).
A deal was nearly made
over the Irish border
but the DUP blocked it.
Who even knows what’s
going on with the rights
of EU citizens in the UK?
The EU has repeatedly
said Britain’s offers are
inadequate and is still
arguing about the role of
the European Court of
Justice. The ongoing un-
certainty has caused many
people (and businesses for
that matter) to leave the
UK (as reported in last
week’s Felix).
The David Davis Guide
to Negotiation:
1. Take the enemy
by surprise by triggering
Article 50 before you’ve
made any preparations
2. Adopt an aggres-
sively jingoistic approach
in all media appearances
3. Pop over to
Brussels for a quick lunch
and press conference
before heading home
4. Be appalled by
leaks from said lunch and
up the anti-EU rhetoric
5. Brief the press
about how wonderful
things will be once we
are free to make our own
rules on the appropriate
curvature of bananas etc.
6. Repeat for several
months
7. Quietly mention
that you have agreed to all
the EU’s demands so far
8. Loudly declare
that a major breakthrough
has been made and great
progress has been made in
the talks
9. Repeat until 2019
when the UK will finally
take back control by doing
almost everything the EU
says while not having the
chance to affect EU deci-
sions
Only three more
years to go… (Trump)
One year into theTrump
administration and we’re
still alive. There isn’t
enough space in the world
to go over everything
that’s happened over the
past twelve months but
here are some memorable
moments:
January: A failed busi-
nessman with a history of
sexual assault allegations
against him moves into the
White House. He signs a
flurry of executive orders
pulling the US out of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership
trade deal and greenlight-
ing construction of the
border wall with Mexico.
February: All Cabinet
positions are finally
filled. A vacancy arises as
national security adviser
Michael Flynn resigns
after being caught lying
to vice-president Mike
Pence over connections
with Russia. Funding for
the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency is slashed,
leading to an uprising of
‘rogue’ Twitter accounts
to lead the resistance.
March: Trump accuses
Barack Obama of wiretap-
ping Trump Tower – as if
Obama didn’t have better
things to do.
April: Trump donates
his quarterly salary to the
National Park Service.
This covers a fraction of
the massive budget cuts
they subsequently suffer.
Trump then gets trigger
happy (at least more so
than usual) and bombs
Syria and Afghanistan.
May: FBI director
James Comey is fired.
Trump is possessed
by Richard Nixon and
alleges he has recordings
of conversations with
Comey. Unsurprisingly,
this transpires to be fake
– unlike Comey’s detailed
memos of those same
conversations.
June: Trump announc-
es America’s withdrawal
from the Paris climate
agreements.
July: Trump’s war on
truth and the media steps
up as he retweets a video
of him body slamming
the CNN logo. At the
G20 summit Trump gets
to meet his best friend
Vladimir Putin. He is less
enamoured by Emmanuel
Macron, who takes a
resounding victory in
the handshake wars and
crushes Trump’s tiny
hands.
August: Trump tries
to ban trans people from
the military. He also
offers tacit support for
white nationalists and
other far-right extremists
by claiming anti-fascist
groups were partially
responsible for violent
clashes in Charlottesville.
September: Trump ends
the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals pro-
gramme that allows young
immigrants to remain in
the US. He also attacks
American football players
that take the knee during
the national anthem and
calls for them to be fired.
A new travel ban is signed
and states immediately
take him to court over it.
October: A terrifying
creature with an over
inflated head and tiny
hands is threatened by a
child in a T-rex costume.
Trump can’t resist taking
a shot at journalists, even
when he’s giving candy to
their children.
November: Trump
pardons a turkey. Jokes
ensue.
December: The travel
ban is finally authorised.
Trump admits – in a tweet
subsequently blamed
on his lawyers – that he
knew Mike Flynn lied not
only to Pence, but to the
FBI. He also recognises
Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel, inflaming tensions
in the Israel-Palestine
conflict.
Having a domestic
(UK)
A female leader with
diminishing popularity
takes her long-ruling party
to the polls and comes out
on top despite losing seats
in parliament. She turns to
the other parties, looking
for someone to prop up
her government but things
don’t look too good.
In a spectacular act of
self-sabotage, Theresa
May called a totally
unnecessary snap general
election and threw away
her slender majority. This
gave us a bizarre scenario
in which the Conserv-
atives, still the single
largest party in Parlia-
ment, were seen to have
lost the election, whereas
Labour, which won fewer
seats in 2017 than it did
in 1992 under Neil Kin-
nock’s leadership, were
cheered on as the winners.
Other highlights
include:
• Brenda from
Bristol echoing the views
of most people, excluding
political commentators
• Lord Buckethead,
Mr Fish finger and Elmo.
Not the politicians we
need but the ones we
deserve
• The unexpected
bromance between
George Osborne and Ed
Balls. It’s astonishing
how much more tolerable
politicians become when
they’re used as light en-
tertainment
• Jeremy Corbyn
trying to high five Emily
Thornberry and getting it
very, very wrong

best (and worst) of what happened this year in politics
“In a
spectacular
act of self-
sabotage,
Theresa
May called a
unnecessary
snap general
election”
“After Scotland
showed the
world how
not to achieve
independence,
Catalonia had
a go”
• Anna Soubry and
other former ministers
being bitter and delighted
at the exit poll
• Corbyn sceptics
suddenly changing their
minds and hailing Jeremy
as the next messiah.
(“Jeremy Corbyn and
JesusChristsharethesame
initials. Coincidence? I
think not!” – quote from a
Labour backbencher with
ambitions of climbing the
greasy pole (probably).)
Then came the West-
minster sex pest dossier
and Jared O’Mara’s old
social media posts. Poli-
ticians fell as the scandal
unfurled – most notably
Michael Fallon, who was
replaced as defence secre-
tary by former chief whip
Gavin Williamson (the
one with the pet tarantula).
While it is an encour-
aging sign that parliament
may be beginning to take
sexual harassment more
seriously, the rush to
condemn people before
job as international de-
velopment secretary after
she was caught having
meetings with Israeli
officials while on holiday.
Theresa May summoned
Patel back to Downing
Street while she was on a
visit (official this time) to
Africa. Countless people
tracked Patel’s flight back
to the UK, making her the
second most-watched flier
after Father Christmas.
Patel’s resignation was a
delight to headline writers,
who went to town with
“Priti [insert derogatory
adjective here]” splashed
across the front pages of
the national press.
When is a military
coup not a military
coup? (Zimbabwe)
Major General Sibusiso
Moyo (a suspiciously
militaristic title) became
the face of the coup/not
coup d’etat in Zimbabwe
when he told the world
that Robert Mugabe
had become a de facto
ex-dictator. After 37 years
in power (and a speech in
which he didn’t resign),
Mugabe and his wife
Gucci Grace were finally
forced out. Celebrators
filled the streets of Harare
but Zimbabwe’s new
president – Emmerson
Mnangagwa, from the
ruling party Zanu-PF –
isn’t much (if any) better.
Known as “the crocodile”,
Mnangagwa is accused
of organising massacres
during Zimbabwe’s civil
war and attacks on oppo-
sition supporters after the
2008 election.
Donald the Dotard
vs Little Rocket Man
(North Korea)
Again, we’re still alive.
North Korea has contin-
ued to test missile tests
and claims to be able to
reach mainland America,
though experts are skep-
tical about the nation’s
ability to mount minia-
turised nuclear warheads
capable of withstanding
atmospheric re-entry. Kim
Jong-unisapparentlyopen
to diplomatic solutions to
the growing tension but
that seems unlikely with
Trump in power.
Australia
Let’s start with the good
news: Australia has legal-
ised same-sex marriage.
Or, as Independent MP
Bob Katter would prefer
to think about, every three
months a person is torn
to death by a crocodile
in north Queensland. (If
you haven’t seen that clip,
watch it immediately. You
will not be disappointed.)
On a less positive note,
refugees and asylum
seekers are still being held
in appalling conditions on
Manus Island and Nauru.
Brutality is rife and food
is scarce. Despite growing
pressure, the government
has still not taken real
action to close down the
detention camps (Austral-
ia officially handed back
full control of Manus to
Papua New Guinea but
many of those on the
island are there because
Australia refused to
shelter them).
Germany
A female leader with
diminishing popularity
takes her long-ruling party
to the polls and comes
out on top despite losing
seats in parliament. She
turns to the other parties,
looking for someone to
prop up her government
but things don’t look too
good. Sound familiar?
Of course Angela
Merkel has a distinct
advantage over Theresa
May: Merkel doesn’t have
Boris Johnson, David
Davis, and Liam Fox
representing Germany’s
interests abroad.
Martin Schulz, leader
(at time of writing) of
Germany’s Social Dem-
ocrats (SPD) is due to
urge his party to enter into
coalition with Merkel’s
Christian Democratic
Union (CDU). Schulz
initially vetoed the idea
but his MPs have forced a
u-turn. While this may be
good for political stability,
it doesn’t look great for
Schulz’s career.
Spain
After Scotland showed
the world how not to
achieve independence,
Catalonia decided to have
a go. What could – and
should – have been a
national debate turned
into a disaster. After a
questionable referendum
and displays of police bru-
tality, central government
imposed direct rule and
called for new elections to
be held later this month.
Former Catalan presi-
dent Carles Puigdemont
remains in Belgium,
although a European
Arrest Warrant against
him has been dropped.
Welcome to plan-
et Venezuela! Entry
costs just $89 billion!
(Venezuela)
Creating ‘planet Vene-
zuela’ is as good an idea
as any and the Labour
front bench probably
wouldn’t mind a holiday
(or as they’re known
in Westminster, ‘group
bonding sessions’).
President Nicolás
Maduro is attempting to
restructure the country’s
massive debts to Russia
and China in an effort to
avoid defaulting. Maduro
has blamed Venezuela’s
economic crisis on US
sanctions (which Trump
tightened up earlier this
year). Meanwhile the
people are starving and
selling toothpaste for
more than the fixed gov-
ernment price has become
punishable by a five year
prison sentence.
Obviously far more
went on this year than can
be covered here. Apolo-
gies for all the things that
haven’t been mentioned.
Let’s hope 2018 is a better
year.

any evidence of impropri-

tragic consequences and

Give due process its
chance. In a week that
saw the death of Christine

stepped back to examine
the evidence before ap-
portioning blame?
