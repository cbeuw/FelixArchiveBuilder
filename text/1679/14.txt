his is a brilliant gift for any occasion, be it
Christmas or a birthday - and especially for
loved ones who might be sailing a rough
patch. The very title itself is encouraging,
and very accurate - this is an anthology of poems
of all kinds that keep one’s feet on the ground,
even when the going gets tough. From typical
choices like Frost’s ‘The Road Not Taken’ to fresh
A
fter years of watching BBC at Christmas
time I have been taught to associate two
things with fiction during the holiday:
fantasy and the Victorian era. The Night
Circus has the perfect setting for a Christmas read
as it captures both these elements, but it also carries
a winter warmth right down to its core. Two young
magicians chose to create a circus as their arena for
a life-long battle of skill which they demonstrate

ave a healthcare professional among your
family and friends? Even if you don’t, they
are sure to enjoy this hilarious journal by ex-
doctor, current comedian Adam Kay. In the
midst of clearing his old doctor possessions, Kay found
a box of journals that he had meticulously written as
a junior doctor, from the first day of work to the day
he quit. These snippets of hospital life show the gritty,
sobering reality of working in the frontlines of the NHS
– a great way to give friends and family working in
healthcare a warm hug to say‘we know what you go
through’.
Even for non-healthcare workers, this is a colourful,
irreverent account of a public service that we all
encounter at some point in our lives - one that
gives an alternative perspective on the profession.
However, be warned – the story does not end as
lightheartedly as it began, a reminder that ultimately
this is a profession that deals with life and death and
the very essence of humanity. -JC
with wonderful illusions. A considerable portion
of the novel is dedicated to simply describing
Morgernstern’s beautiful inventions that it
becomes a visually stimulating, cinematic
experience. Every other sense is exploited as
everything is given sumptuous detail. Les Cirque
des Rêves is the perfect place to spend Christmas
– a visit to the ice garden, warming your fingers
by the bonfire, drinking hot chocolate and eating
indulgent treats. I suppose reading this book is as
close as you can get to the real thing. -AP
T
he one book that I’m asking for this year is
UncommonType.Atfirst,Iwasslightlyanxious
that Tom Hanks wouldn’t be able to deliver
some good writing, but then I read the first
short story of the collection.‘Three ExhaustingWeeks’
is by no means the best piece of work I’ve ever read,
but it managed to charm me anyway. It’s a mash of
mundane things during a relationship without frills.
The characters are entirely plausible and it’s here that
I think Hanks will excel in the rest of the collection.
Obviously, we know Hanks best as an actor, a job he
does astoundingly well. Surely, in essence, writing is
the same thing – bringing characters to an audience
and making them believable – just by a different
medium. Even if he falls short on one story, you can
just skip to the next. Maybe that would mean the
collection’s not perfect, but it’s a choice that is useful
when giving a gift. The themes are broad, from the
American Dream to Christmas during World War II:
there’s something to interest everyone. -AP
This is Going To Hurt, by Adam Kay
surprising finds like Amanda Dalton’s ‘How to
Disappear’, the poems are organised into chapters
that each address a different theme. For example,
‘Body and Soul’addresses existential thoughts and
meditations on the soul, ‘In and out of love’ sings
of romance and heartbreak, while ‘Growing up’
addresses childhood, family and finding oneself,
among other themes. There is definitely a poem
for every emotion one might go through in life,
and thus a versatile present indeed. -JC

am ashamed to say that I got into the work of
Elizabeth Strout far, far too late. This summer,
travelling to the same coast, I bought a copy
of her latest work, Anything is Possible. Dealing
with similar themes to her other work – the
intense claustrophobia and interconnectedness
of small town life – I was completely blown away
by the novel, which takes completely unexpected

his year, The Underground Railroad won
the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book
Award for Fiction and the Arthur C. Clarke
Award. I had high hopes when I started
reading this book, and it didn’t disappoint. The
story follows Cora, a young slave attempting
to escape from a plantation in Georgia, and her
journey across America on the underground

on Fosse to tell the story of the Norwegian
fisherman Johannes in only a hundred pages.
To be exact, we only learn about the two most
significant events in his life: his birth and his
death. It is an obscure account of a highly unexciting
life. Fosse throws all punctuation conventions over
board and creates a world, in which dream and reality
embrace each other and in which no clear border can
be drawn between them. The fisherman dies and the
reader is taken on a journey into a world between life
anddeath,whereJohannesspendsthelastdaybefore
departing into the world of the dead. It took me only
two days to finish this book and I am still impressed
by Fosse’s precise style of storytelling. Morning and
Evening asks for a lot of attention from the reader,
but rewards everybody who is willing to read it with
an open mind with a unique and mesmerising story.

railroad. Historically, the underground railroad
was a network of safe houses protecting runaway
slaves, but in this novel its spirit manifests as a real-
world railway, which Cora uses at various points in
the novel to escape cruelty and journey towards a
more hopeful future. The cruelty Cora experiences
highlights the thread of hope running through
the novel, making it even more poignant. I felt a
great connection with Cora, with whom you will
experience the depths of despair and realise how
resilient a person’s spirit can be. -Katie Cook
F
rom its very first line – “History has failed
us, but no matter” – Pachinko is a poignant
and thoughtful story of resilience. In 1911,
Sunja, a young Korean girl with a humble
background, must migrate to Japan to save her
family from ruin. We learn of her struggles, and
those of the three generations that follow her.
Lee spent time in Japan speaking with people she
met in markets, learning about the lives of people
with Korean heritage, which clearly contributes to
the sense of reality in the novel. Sunja isn’t very
remarkable, but it’s the honest characteristics
of ordinary people that make her attractive and
interesting, as well as her subtle strength in the
face of adversity. Even more modesty and truth
is felt in novel the through the use of simple yet
beautiful writing. No frills, just the struggles and
emotions of people. Pachinko is a success with
much critical acclaim and deserves to be subject
of more conversation. -Alice Peberdy
Morning and Evening, by Jon Fosse
twists in the subtlest of ways. To call Anything in
Possible a ‘novel’ is a misnomer: really it is a series
of interconnected short stories, which build up to
a collective whole. Taking place in Strout’s usual
setting of Maine, Anything is Possible shows how
the individual members of a society interact with
one another, and how communities are created.
Richly detailed, but in prose that is measured and
precise, Strout may be the only writer who is able
to come close to Alice Munro’s mastery of writing
on domesticity. -Fred Fyles
