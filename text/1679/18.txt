SACAs mug for Christmas
Help the Hungry and Homeless
this Holiday Season
In all the festive spirit we sometimes forget about those that are less
fortunate than ourselves, Notting Hill Community Church are putting on
a special Festive themed Dinner Club to help feed the homeless this
Winter. They would be very grateful if you could volunteer a couple
hours of your time on 14 December to help set up and serve dinner to
the homeless service users, there will even be a choir singing some of
everyone’s favourite carols.
For more information on how to volunteer your time please email
volunteering@imperial.ac.uk or visit the Students’ Union Website.
Who’s made your first term terrific or your studies spectacular?
Christmas is a time for giving, the Student Academic Choice Awards
(SACAs) are your opportunity to say thank you to academic and support
staff.These annual awards recognise and reward the impact and passion
of staff throughout College.

SACAs mug and is in for the chance of winning an award.

and give them the gift of a SACAs mug. For more information and to
