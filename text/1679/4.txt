Central Library gets
air con
Just before last Christ-
mas, Library Services
announced that plans
were in place to improve
temperature control in
Central Library, following
a number of complaints
from students. Now,
nearly a year later, the
first phase of works are
coming to an end, with
study spaces beginning to
open up on Levels 4 and
5.
While the move has
been welcomed by
students annoyed about
the temperature levels in
Central Library – Library
Services has said tem-
perature control was “the
single biggest source
of complaint from the
student body for several
years” – the works have
faced a number of delays.
The two floors were
supposed to be opened
by the beginning of
November, but will now
face a “soft” opening as
books are returned to their
rightful shelves and new
furniture put in place.
Library Services have
also been sharing images
of the new plug sockets on
social media – a welcome
relief for anyone who’s
experienced the hunt for
a working socket in the
Library.
The next phase of the
development is scheduled
to start in summer of
next year, as cooling and
ventilation systems are
installed on Levels 2 and
3. Similar to this year’s
works, those levels will
be closed off as the ren-
ovations occur. The total
development is scheduled
to cost £11 million.
Controversial ‘Tie
Clubs’paper passed
This March, arguments
around the use of Union
storage space for tankards
belonging to ‘Tie Clubs’
arose in Union Council.
The clubs, which include
the 22 Club, the Chaps
Club, and the Links Club,
among others, mainly
function as social socie-
ties.
A paper was raised
in Council, arguing that
tie clubs should not be
allowed to make use
of Union facilities and
storage until they had
proven that they adhered
to the Union’s Equal Op-
portunities Policy. Some
students had expressed
concern that tie clubs
were discriminatory
in their membership
policies; a number of tie
club members denied this
charge, saying they let in
students of all genders.
An amended version
of the paper was passed,
which stated that any
groups storing tankards
would not be allowed to
breach the Union’s Safe
Space Policy, and did
not single out tie clubs in
particular. The paper was
passed by a large major-
ity, and Felix believe a
challenge has been made
against the 22 Club to
show they adhere to the
Safe Space Policy within
the next two months.
TEF applications
This year marked
the introduction of the
"Teaching Excellence
Framework" (TEF), a
government assessment
of the quality of higher
education providers. Im-
perial achieved Gold, the
highest level possible.
TEF has not been
without its controversies:
developed by the Depart-
ment of Education, it is
described as a “scheme
for recognising excellent
teaching”, but initially
was scheduled to be
linked to tuition fees. A
university that achieved
the highest level of TEF
would be able to increase
their tuition fees in line
with inflation.
For Imperial College
Union, the proposals
presented a dilemma:
while they had adopted
a proposal to oppose any
increase in tuition fees or
marketisation of higher
education, by involving
themselves with TEF the
Union would be able to
shape College policy. Fol-
lowing an extraordinary
Council meeting at the
beginning of January, a
motion to engage with
College on TEF was
passed with minor amend-
ments. Imperial gained
their TEF Gold status in
June.
However, in October of
line with inflation. Recent
studies have also found
that the majority of stu-
dents – while welcoming
evaluation of a univer-
sity’s quality – do not
believe that TEF should
be linked to tuition fees.
Smoke Free
Imperial implemented
a smoking ban across all
College campuses and
properties from the 1st
of
August.
The move, which had
been discussed for over a
year, took place following
a referendum. Around
750 students took part in
the referendum, of which
the majority thought that
smoking should be banned
on campus. A working
group then made the
decision to ban smoking
within 20m of all College
land. It is unclear how the
ban is being enforced – a
College spokesperson told
Felix that it would “not be

until 2019, negating any

As the year draws to a close, we take a look back at what's happened at Imperial for the past 12 months. Expect
tie clubs, cooked breakfasts, and library closures
around campus this year
principally the responsi-
bility of security staff”,
but would be implement-
ed with the cooperation
of staff and students. The
College said that the ban
was an attempt to fulfil
their “duty of care to staff
and students”.
Those returning to
Imperial this autumn
were greeted by a number
of large signs that had
popped up around
campus, informing them
of the changes. Felix has
heard reports that several
of these signs have since
been taken home by
students, with one turning
up in the Fulham Slug and
Lettuce.
Woodward Buildings
fails fire safety tests
The cladding system
used in Woodward Build-
ings, one of Imperial’s
newest student halls,
failed fire safety tests
carried out this summer.
The tests were ordered by
the government following
the tragic fire in Greenfell
Tower, which killed 70
people.
The results of the tests
were revealed to the halls’
690 occupants via an
sentence in which they
said the actual reason for
writing the letter”. Wood-
ward Buildings were the
only Imperial halls with
cladding that failed tests,
although nearly 200 other
buildings across the UK
had failed tests.
Cooked breakfast
removed from SCR
menu
Postgraduate students
looking forward to
tucking into the Senior
Common Room’s (SCR)
cooked breakfast this year
were left disappointed,
with Imperial’s Campus
Services removing the
option amid wide-ranging
changes to services.
As well as removing
cooked breakfasts, the
College increased prices
across all outlets operated
by Campus Services,
reviewed their portion
sizes, reduced the range
of options on offer, and
cut the opening times of
a number of their outlets.
The move provoked
criticism from staff and
students, with one staff
member saying “the
fact is that catering is
now less varied and less
affordable”, and another
telling Felix “it sounds
like [when the College
talk about] reducing their
cost, it’s really coming out
of our pocket.”
Changes to opening
hours also came under
fire: overall, during term
time, campus outlets will
be open for ten fewer
hours a day. Ethos gym
also changed its out-
of-term opening hours,
cutting them by 18 hours
a week, a move that
disproportionately affects
postgraduate students and
staff. One staff member
told Felix that in the last
ten years their experience
at Imperial had been
“unfortunately worse and
worse”.
Campus Services
defended the changes,
saying that their catering
facilities operated at a
loss, and that Ethos was
used by fewer people
outside of term time,
hence the change to hours.
In October, Imperial
College Union launched a
survey in response to these
changes, asking students
to give their thoughts on
outlet opening hours; the
results of this survey are
yet to be announced.
Imperial fall in People
and Planet League
Tables
Imperial plummeted
in the People and Planet
league tables – published
this November – which
rank universities based on
environmental and ethical
criteria. They dropped
from 96th to 141st in the
rankings, making them
bottom of the Russell
Group, with a score of
18.5% – this earned them
a ‘failed’ rating.
Imperial’s results,
which were based on a
number of metrics, were
described as “entirely fair”
and “unsurprising” by a
number of students, who
highlighted the amount
Imperial has invested in
fossil fuel companies.
People and Planet report-
ed that Imperial currently
has nearly £9 million of
their endowment fund
invested in the fossil fuel
industry, as well as several
millions invested in arms
companies.
While Imperial has a
number of departments
dedicated to climate
change and sustainability,
such as the Grantham
Institute for Climate
Change, they scored
extremely poorly in a
range of areas, including
education for sustainable
development. One aca-
demic told Felix that the
results showed that it was
“about time the College
takes sustainability as
seriously as the other 140
universities ahead of us.”
Union and College
under fire for han-
dling of sexual as-
sault case
An alumna of Imperial
told Felix that the Union
and College’s handling
of her sexual assault was
“more distressing” than
the incident itself.
The alumna told Felix
that she was attending
an event at the Union
earlier this year when she
Union or College at the
time, only doing so two
months later, when the
accused perpetrator was
running to be president
of a student society. She
was passed between the
College and the Union in
an investigation that took
seven months, and left her
suicidal at points.
As well as frequent
periods with no commu-
nication, there was no
central point of contact
provided by the College,
leaving the alumna feeling
isolated. There were
problems with collecting
witness statements: none
of the witnesses were able
to provide a statement
without some form of
miscommunication, the
accused did not have his
statement collected until
October, and at some
points the alumna was
encouraged to contact
witnesses herself.
When the investiga-
tion came to a close, the
Union concluded that the
accused was guilty of
sexual misconduct, but
that the accused’s position
of authority was not “an
enabling factor”, since he
was not in the position at
the time of the incident.
The victim described this
outcome as “a mere slap
on the wrist”, as well as
“irrelevant and offensive”.
The victim told Felix that
“unless the Union can
demonstrate they are able
to handle sexual abuse
cases efficiently, fairly,
and supportively, it is clear
to me they should not take
on this responsibility.”
The College and Union
have both said that they
will learn lessons from
the case, and review their
policy for future com-
plaints. It is highly likely
that this will not be the last
complaint Imperial needs
to investigate: research
in 2010 found that one in
seven female students in
the UK had been a victim
of sexual violence.
“Woodward
was declared
'safe' despite
its cladding
failing the fire
safety tests”
email, which assured them
that – despite failing the
tests – the building was
“safe for occupancy”. The
College have been con-
sulting with professionals
regarding removal of the
cladding, and are awaiting
results of tests carried out
by the Building Research
Establishment (BRE). A
College spokesperson told
Felix they expect results
early in the new year.
Residents of the hall
also revealed to Felix that
“The victim
said that the
investigation
by the Union
and College
and Union
was more
distressing
than the
assault ”
was sexually assaulted
by a current student. She
did not report it to the
staff had been breaching
fire safety protocol by
wedging open doors
across a single floor.
One student said that the
approach the College had
taken was “insulting to
our intelligence, with nine
paragraphs of shallow
reassurance, and only one
