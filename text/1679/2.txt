The true meaning of Christmas
DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THIS WEEK'S PHOENIX PULLOUT!
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN CONTRIBUTING, EMAIL PHOENIX@IC.AC.UK
I
t looks like Christmas
(or any non-denom-
inational holiday
of your choice) has
come early this year: what
you’re holding in your
hand is the largest issue
of Felix we’ve printed this
year. 56 full-colour pages
of quality content, for
you to tuck into as term
winds down. Or to use as
wrapping paper – it’s what
I’m going to do, let’s be
honest.
To say it’s all Felix
would be a misnomer,
however: this week we’re
super pleased to have the
first edition of this year’s
Phoenix magazine, which
highlights art produced
right here at Imperial. For
many students, Imperial
can seem like a dull, sterile
place, where you drag
yourself out of bed for a
morning lecture during
which neither yourself
nor the lecturer are paying
attention, and then cram a
Library Cafe jacket potato
into your mouth before
heading to an afternoon of
labs. And it is this. But it
can also be so much more.
As evidenced, not
only by this issue of
Phoenix, but by all that
has been produced in the
paper over the last term,
students at Imperial have
a range of interests and
passions outside their
course. From our Books
Editors being invested in
decolonising the canon, to
our Film Editors predict-
ing the Oscar awards, to
our sports teams getting in
reports every week (shout
out to ICXCAC, you guys
are the real MVP), for so
many of us life does not
just begin and end with
our studies.
Christmas is nearly
upon us, and I’d like to
take this time to think
about some things I’m
thankful for. Firstly, I’m
thankful for the fact that
thisisthelastissueofFelix
for a while – although
this job is great, there’s
only so much late-night,
half-price Wasabi I can
take. We’ll be returning in
January, so don’t worry,.
I’m also thankful to
Hamish Beck, our Puzzles
Editor, who has helped
make the office a more
hospitable place through
his donation of food
and kitchen equipment.
Hamish has told me that
he doesn’t read any of the
paper that’s not Puzzles
(as many students do), so
I doubt he’ll see this.
Most of all, I’d like
to thank the incredible
editorial team we have at
Felix. I started this year
with only a handful of
people on the team – the
rest had graduated, moved
on, or (in one case)
moved to Japan to start
a new life as a post-doc-
toral KWEEN. So I was
worried that it would just
be me and a couple of the
old Arts Editors in the
Felix Office: it would be
great, but no paper would
be produced. But what
happened was we spent
the summer putting out
adverts, getting in touch
with various societies,
and hearing of people who
were interested through
word of mouth.
We started the year
with about 20 new people
– a number that is steadily
growing. They’ve dealt
with my shit chat, learning
how to use InDesign, and
the total outage of the
West Basement computer
network, during which
time they just had to
twiddle their thumbs at
home. And they’ve not
asked for anything in
exchange (except perhaps
a few Colin the caterpillar
cakes...). They’re doing
it because they enjoy
it – seeing their name in
print, and creating some-
thing they can physically
hold in their hands. I am
so proud of all of them,
and I love them all more
than I could possibly say.
They’ve been willing to
slave away over a temper-
amental Mac computers
for hours to get their end
of year lists to fit into the
correct space, just so you
can skip past them and
head straight to the Horo-
scopes – and that’s what’s
Christmas is all about.
