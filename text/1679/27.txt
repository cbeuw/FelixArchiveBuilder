YOUR
WEEK
AHEAD
This is the last week
of Felix for this
year, so you better
take our advice for
once and go along
to some of these
great events!
MONDAY 11TH
DECEMBER
Twice a year since
2011, a grey, victory-hun-
gry horde has descended
on Beit. The reason: The
Central London Chess
Congress. For amateurs
and masters alike, the
tournament has become
an important and much-
loved fixture in London’s
Chess calendar.
In this year’s second
event, round one opened
on Friday 03/11/17 to a
healthy entry list of 107 in
the Union Concert Hall.
The event was organized
by Imperial College
alumnus John Sargent
with the assistance of the
College’s chess club, and
officiated by the legend-
ary FIDE International
Arbiter Adam Raoof.
Entrants were divided into
three sections based on
ability, with five rounds

CGCU MINCE PIE
PARTY
It’s national Christmas
Jumper Day, and it’s also
the last day of term.

mince pies to every engi-
neer at lunch time!
Keep an eye on our Face-
book page for location.

to separate them over the
course of the weekend.
In the Minor section,
recent Physics graduate
and former club President
Apurva Deshpande (better
known as Appy) finished
with a respectable 2.5
points out of a possible
5, while a good showing
from Bioengineering
student and London Chess
League veteran Bob Yung
earned him 3/5. Consid-
ering that the section’s
winner – Martin Van Tol
– accrued 4/5, Appy and
Bob’s performances are
very promising.
Doctoral Student
from the Department of
Chemistry and Imperial
College Chess Club VP,
one Francesco Salerno
represented the college in
the Major section. Repeat-
ing his performance from
April, he cruised to equal
first in a field of more than
thirty—drawing twice
and winning three games!
Sharing his spot on the
podium was first seed E.
Xaxiris of Greece.
Mathematics post-
graduate Aluna Rizzoli
alone repped the College
in a typically brutal open
section, clawing two
points from five against
consistently higher-rated
opposition. The tourna-
ment ended with first
place shared between
Adam Bukojemski and
Philip Tozer, with re-
markable performances
eclipsing the favourite,
FIDE Master Jovica
Radovanovic! As in any
sport, hunger, physical
and mental condition,
and luck can be every bit
as important as skill or
experience.
For a remarkably
successful weekend,
we’d like to thank:
campus, its unsurprising
that LabourSoc has been
doing well this term.
However, our surge has
surpassed even my expec-
tations. Our membership
now stands at an all-time
record high. We’ve been
able to organise a slew of
events, including multiple
visits to Parliament, film
screenings, Imperial’s
Bloc at the Free Educa-
tion demo, and “Pints
and Policy” – our regular
new social in Eastside
Bar. We’re also hosting
our first Xmas dinner next
Monday (tickets come off
the Union website Friday
2pm).
Next term, we’ll be
holding Pints and Policy
fortnightly on a Friday
evening. On the off weeks,
we’ll have open meetings
on Tuesday evenings, so
members can participate
in decision making in the
society. We’re planning
more trips to Parliament,
a visit to Brussels,
discussion panels with
MPs, a debate between
a Labour and Tory MP,
and campaigning for next
years’ local elections
(EU and Commonwealth
citizens can vote!!).
Many of these events will
be co-hosted with Labour
clubs at other London
universities. Whether you
want to meet like-minded
people, visit interesting
places, hear from MPs,
or protest and campaign,
this is the society for
you – join us at tiny.
cc/iclabour. Have a red
Christmas!
