W
ere this ar-
ticle a film,
I’d like to
think that
it would be in contention
for recognition from the
Academy. It had a clear
and bold start, compelling
second act, and now,
hopefully, a memorable
ending. But seriously,
let’s talk about who will
end up winning the big
prizes next spring. There
are always strong indi-
cators from the second a
film finishes its first press
screening of its chances.
It is a long road from
there on, with numerous
twists and bumps. Since
this article was written, a
number of critics’ groups
and smaller awards cere-
monies have taken place
that have cemented the
position of some films,
while seeing others have
their chances diminished.
Just this Wednesday, Get
with unexpected awards
success, and it may well
not be one of the front
runners. More bizarrely,
master surrealist David
Lynch’s magnificent Twin
Peaks: The Return, aired
on Showtime over eight-
een episodes, was named
the second best film of the
year. While Lynch himself
considers his work a very
long film, it is the con-
tinuation of a television
show, aired on television,
in an episodic format.
This once again highlights
the blurring between film
and television that was
demonstrated by O.J.:
Made in America winning
best documentary at the
Academy Awards last
year. It must be noted that
two of the films that I will
discuss here, The Post and
Phantom Thread, were
not featured in the Sight
and Sound poll as they
have yet to screen outside
of the States.
Front Runners
It is increasingly
becomingatrendforOscar
contenders to emerge
from Sundance. Last year
it was Manchester by the
Sea (after The Birth of
a Nation was tanked by
details of Nate Parker’s
1999 rape trial emerging).
This year Call Me by
Your Name arrived like
a juggernaut. Luca Gua-
dagnino has shown talent
throughout his career,
but he finally brings it all
together for this elegant
coming-of-age drama, set
in 1983 Italy, chronicling
the romantic relationship
between a 17 year old boy
and his father’s American
student. Adapted from
André Aciman’s novel
by Oscar stalwart James
Ivory, Call Me by Your
Name has continued its
momentum from the start
of the year, playing well
through the fall festivals,
and will go wide in the
States at the end of the
month. It is sure to get
nods from the Academy
should get a best cine-
matography nomination.
Timothée Chalamet is
a rising star (he also
appears in Lady Bird and
Hostiles this winter), and
should become one of the
youngest ever nominees
for best actor. Michael
Stuhlbarg could finally
earn an Oscar nomination
for Best Supporting Actor
for his best performance
since A Serious Man
(one scene in particular
in the third act should
have voters sold). Armie
Hammer has never
really given much of an
indication that he could
act particularly well,
but he acquits himself
solidly here. It may not be
enough for a nomination,
especially if Academy
voters are unsure whether
to place him as a lead
or supporting actor, but
he can be proud of his
career-best work.
When considering the
best British filmmakers
of the modern day, many
will answer ‘Christopher
and cinematic quality to
big budget science fiction
films. His Dark Knight
trilogy was for the most
part a vast improvement
on previous efforts from
Tim Burton and Joel
Schumacher (though
undeniably Darren Ar-
onofsky’s planned Taxi
Driver-style neo-noir
with Joaquin Phoenix as
the caped crusader would
have been the greatest
possible on-screen
depiction of Batman).
Nolan’s long-awaited war
piece, Dunkirk, opened
to rapturous acclaim in
the summer, and proved
popular with audiences
too, raking in over $500
million at the box office.
In the past Nolan has been
criticised for his over long
run times, paper thin char-
acters and cringe-worthy
dialogue. For the most part
he does away with these
faults, instead playing

continued its
momentum by
being named
the best film
of the year in
the prestigious
Sight and
Sound poll”
Out continued its mo-
mentum by being named
the best film of the year
in the prestigious Sight

Peele’s genre-bender is
following its unexpected
commercial success
“Call Me by

Timothée Chalamet is fast becoming a top pick for Best Actor // Sony Picture Classics
to his strengths of visual
style and roaring sound.
Expect Dunkirk to score
highly in the technical
categories, alongside the
obvious Best Picture and
Best Director nods. With
this being a true ensemble
piece, it is unlikely to
score any acting nomina-
tions in spite of the strong
performances all round,
with Mark Rylance the
most likely for Best Sup-
porting Actor, a category
he won two years ago for
Bridge of Spies. Warner
decided to release this
suspense thriller in July,
aiming to avoid any notion
of it being Oscar bait, and
also peculiarly wanting to
emulate Saving Private
Ryan, a similarly visceral
war film that of course
undeservingly lost to
Shakespeare in Love for
Best Picture in 1998. They
will have fingers crossed
that Dunkirk fares better
and goes all the way to the
Dolby Theatre podium.
Spielberg. Hanks.
Streep. The last film to
release a trailer this year
was The Post. Since then
many seem to have placed
this historical drama at the
head of the pack of con-
tenders for best picture.
Ten or twenty years ago
this would have been the
shrewd move. However,
this is 2017, and the
Academy will no longer
bow down to big names
and dry biopics. Granted,
Spielberg’s recent period
dramas Lincoln and
Bridge of Spies have been
against the fiery perfor-
mances that McDormand
and Ronan have given?
This is a timely film given
that it concerns the role of
The Washington Post and
The New York Times in
the leak of the Pentagon
Papers that detailed the
role of the United States
Government during
the Vietnam War. The
parallels with the Trump
regime are obvious. If
it is as good as Spotlight
or All the President’s
Men then it has a chance
(co-writer Josh Singer
also co-wrote Spotlight
incidentally). It features
a strong supporting cast,
including TV stars Sarah
Paulson, Carrie Coon,
Matthew Rhys, and Bob
Odenkirk. There were
allegedly issues in the
editing room, but any fear
that The Post’s chances
of Oscar glory could
be derailed have been
allayed by strong early
reviews and the National
Board of Review naming
it the best film of the
year on Tuesday, as well
as awarding Streep and
Hanks Best Actress and
Best Actor respectively.
While the Oscars are
overwhelmingly biased
towards English-language
cinema, the Academy has
at times failed to properly
reward the greats of
American cinema. Sure
the likes of Ford, Wilder
and Capra won multiples
times, but Kubrick,
Lynch and Altman never
won Best Director. Even
Scorsese has only one win
from eight nominations,
long overdue when he
took home his award for
The Departed, a film far
from his best work. Paul
Thomas Anderson is just
the latest in a long line
of mercurial talents to
be undervalued by the
Academy. From six nom-
inations he is yet to win
a single time. His latest
film, Phantom Thread,
sees him reunite with
Sir Daniel Day-Lewis
for the latter’s final ever
performance. The last
time the two collaborated
Anderson came so close
to sweeping the Academy
Awards with There Will
Be Blood, only to lose
in his categories to No
Country for Old Men. Men
is a great film, and one of
the best of the century,
but Blood is one of the
greatest films ever made.

Post boasts
Streep and
Hanks, this is
2017, and the
Academy will
no longer bow
down to big
names”
very good, but neither took
home Best Picture. We
are a quarter of a century
from the days when
Hanks dominated the
Best Actor category, and
while Streep will get her
customary nomination,
can she really compete
Day-Lewis of course won
for Best Actor in that
film, and has since gone
on to become the most
successful actor in Oscar
history. The Academy
revelled in handing him
his record third victory
for Lincoln (especially
after front runner Joaquin
Phoenix badmouthed
the whole notion of
them do so again. Jonny
Greenwood reinvented
film scoring in Blood, and
while he is up against stiff
competition from the likes
of Hans Zimmer, even the
likable German admits
that it is Greenwood
who is the finest film
composer on the planet
at the minute. Phantom
Thread will be a strong
contender in a number of
technical categories, in-
cluding Costume Design,
Makeup and Hairstyling,
and Production Design.
Anderson himself will not
just be gunning for the
triple crown previously
bestowed on the likes of
Wilder, Brooks, the Coens
and Coppola; he will be
going for a quadruple,
as he also serves as the
cinematographer on his
newest film (a fact he is
keen to play down). He
has recently proved a little
too esoteric for Academy
voters, in the way that
Kubrick was ahead of his
time, and only gained full
appreciation years later.
Anderson will be hoping
that his time is now.
“Paul Thomas
Anderson will
be gunning
for the triple
crown of Best
Film, Best
Director, and
Best Original
Screenplay
for Phantom
Thread”
awards season, calling it
“complete bullshit” and
“the worst carrot I have
ever tasted”), and it would
not be surprising to see
Meryl Streep is likely to get an obligatory nod for The Post // Fox
Dunkirk will probably get a number of technical awards // Warner Bros
