fly-half Allingham, who
drew the man and popped
to winger Parker. After
skinning his opposition
winger, Parker went for
the chip-and-chase over
the next defender, the
opposition nine. The kick
was low, and ricocheted
off his back straight back
into Parker’s hands, who
then went on to race
down the touchline and
score the most memorable
debut try for the 1st
team
in living history. 19-7.
Shuz, disappointed that
he was yet to be involved
in this try-scoring flurry
as this season’s top try
scorer (how did we let
this happen?) smashed
over the line several
phases later, giving us a
commanding 24-7 lead
with 20 minutes to go
and securing the four-try
bonus point.
However, the game
was not yet won. Big
Nate, weighed down by
the pressure of not adding
to his sc coefficient with
the Captain of Morale
watching him closely from
the side-line, buckled
and went off with a knee
injury. Blackett tried to
keep the momentum going
with a quick tap penalty,
ceeded to our half, where
our try line defence came
under pressure. The
referee, having penalised
us on several occasions
already, sin binned prop
Martin Head for having
forgotten to pay his
transport fees. Due to
having no uninjured front
row replacements left,
we were down to 13 men
with a scrum on our own
five metre line. Scrums
went uncontested and
backs were drafted into
the scrum. Brady tried
to navigate his way into
the second row, took the
wrong exit and ended up in
Sainsbury’s an hour later.
Once the game resumed,
IC battled to keep BARTS
from scoring whilst
two men down. With
two-man tackles used to
full effect and a shed load
of effort, the try line was
miraculously kept clear
for 9 minutes. However,
not to feel left out from
all the sin-binning, Toby
Simpson bubble-wrapped
his hand around a ball in
the middle of a ruck, only
to be socked by the ref
and sent for a 10 minute
opportunity to reflect on
whether we’d ever win a
game. Down to 12 men,
“After skinning

chase over the

but Toby Simpson had
other ideas, tackling his
own teammate to prevent
this. BARTS, sensing the
opportunity for blood,
attacked with renewed
vigour. The game pro-
nothing. We were back on
the front foot as fresher
Nick burst through the
line for a 40 yard break.
His pass found a mean-
dering trolley, who tried
his best to run it in, but
simply lacked the legs to
finish the job. Shouldn’t
have missed that Monday
gym session for your lab
report, mate. However,
the attack continued and,
several phases later, the
ball was passed wide to
Aleksei Zaboronsky (who
played the whole match
at no. 8 by the way, mum
and dad). He subsequently
ignored an easy two on
one and instead went for
the line himself, barely
making his way over for
the try and hence complet-
ing the KES boy hattrick
(shout out to Richard
Mahony). We now led
29-14. With a minute
remaining, on came Toby
Simpson and we were
back to 15 men. However,
for pride BARTS contin-
ued to press and scored
“We were back

foot as fresher

a consolation try in the
final play of the match.
Full time score 29-21 to
Imperial.
It didn’t matter, the
match was won. RIP
the DNS era: 10/03/12 -
even the grittiest defence
became insufficient and
BARTS ran in a try out
wide several phases later.
Conversion successful, it
was 24-14.
The initial sin bin was
now over, and so we were
back to 14 men; the one
man disadvantage felt like

L
ast Wednesday
saw a vital match
for Imperial
1st
XV against
fellow bottom-of-the-
league dwellers BARTS.
Still searching for our
first win of the season at
the end of November, this
was a must-win occasion,
and a loss would almost
certainly subject us to
relegation at the end of the
season. An experienced
XV, devoid of freshers
after injuries and U20
world cups in Hong Kong
(classic), jogged out to
Run after run, tackle after
tackle, they bore down
on our line, edging ever
closer.After repelling sev-
eral waves, the ball went
wide and our try line was
breached. 7-0 to BARTS.
However, the team stayed
clam. We knew that today
was our day. Once again
the BARTS barrage
resumed, but their game
plan had no variation;
the defence adapted and
soon the gain line was
being breached less and
less, the tackles becoming
more and more dominant.
Farmer Aynsley, tired of
being the lesser known
housemate to agricultural
manure expert Simpson,
ran up and dump tackled
BARTS’ main runner.
The attack was shaken,
and the tide began to turn.
With ball in hand, we
were looking more dan-
gerous, and suddenly we
were camped in their 22,
trying to level the scores.
Several attempts came
tantalisingly close, only
to be thrown away due to
an overly optimistic out-
the-back offload attempt
finally whipped the ball
wide from a scrum, fly
half James Field (clearly
jealous of Zaboronsky’s
reputation as the offload
king) popped a no-look
backhand offload to the
grateful hands of Josh
Pope, who galloped his
way over the line to
finally touchdown for
Imperial. With Field
adding the extras, we
were tied at 7 apiece.
The momentum was with
us. However, just before
half-time was reached, the
team’s morale was tested.
Recently self-elected
Captain of Morale Tuleu,
whose shoulder stability
and self-confidence were
already low after a recent
bench press competition
with his longstanding
girlfriend Louisa, suffered
a shoulder dislocation
and was subjected to the
side-line for the rest of
the match. Shortly after-
wards, it was half-time. At
7-7, there was everything
to play for.
The second half kicked
off, and the team hit their
rhythm; the heaviest
dethroned megs-master
Chopper, were carrying
hard, the lineout was
firing on all cylinders, the
backline was tearing holes
in the opposition every
other play and the passes
were going to hand. The
wind was now against
us, but nonetheless a kick
went out in the corner and
we had a lineout 15 metres
from their line. The move
worked seamlessly and
the resulting driving
maul chugged its way
forwards. The maul rolled
around, the ball being
passed from forward to
forward until McGrail
finally dribbled his way
over. The conversion was
good. 14-7 to us. From the
kick-off, Polish cultural
expert Hallett smashed
up a carry to get the team
moving forward. Scrum
half Blackett then passed
the ball blind to wannabe

shadow of DNS’s curse
hanging heavily over us,
we knew the test that stood
before us. Kick off. The
match started and BARTS
