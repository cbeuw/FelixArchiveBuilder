F1 car have more in common than you think
“Heathrow’s
scheduling is
decided solely
by a McLaren
program that
helps reduce
wait times”
“Also, not
everything we
develop for F1
can be applied
outside of
the field to a
completely
different
product”
that methods developed
from racing experience
are now being used
throughout a variety of
fields.Another example of
racing engineers making
a world of a difference
is flight timetables. In
today’s world, departure
and arrival times are not
decided by humans in
Applied technologies
program that helps reduce
wait times as well as CO2
emissions.
Applying racing tech-
nologies to real-world
projects is a task that
requires a great deal of
cooperation between
work groups as well as a
delicate approach to intel-
lectual property laws and
Formula 1 regulations.
During McLaren F1’s
latest visit to Imperial,
I had the opportunity
to speak to the team’s
CFD Methodology Team
Leader Julian Hoessler,
who shed some light on
the challenges involved.
Tom: Current Formula
1 cars use a great deal
of carbon composites
to produce a strong-
er yet lighter chassis.
Can you see these ad-
vancements affecting
road cars in the near
future?
Julien: There are a few
different types of carbon
composite plies we are
looking into for different
purposes. For instance,
the wing needs to flex a
certain amount but not
more than that, so we go
to quite extreme lengths to
get just the right stiffness
and that rotational stiff-
ness. I don’t know if those
exact composites will be
as beneficial in the auto-
motive industry but they
will have properties that
could be useful in road
cars. It would be the same
technology, just used
differently for different
problems.
T: Are there any tech-
nological similarities
between the hybrid
powertrainsinMcLar-
en Road Cars and the
F1 cars?
J: Yes, the idea of the
McLaren P1 was to use a
similar type of recovery
system, but this is not
something you’ll neces-
sarily see translated into
regular road cars. For
instance, if you look at
the P1, we use the hybrid
engine during gearshifts to
avoid losing time shifting
gears. This is something
you’ll never see in a
standard road car, it’s all
about performance rather
then saving fuel, so it’s
exclusive to performance
cars.
In an F1 car, you have
the ERS and the KERS.
Things might change a
little bit in 2020, because
they will simplify it a
little bit and get rid of
the MGU-H. That would
make the cars a little bit
more similar to what you
see in standard road cars.
T: What is the trans-
fer of information
between McLaren
Racing and McLaren
AppliedTechnologies
like?
J: Yes, there are a lot
of things that are being
shared. The composite
chains are quite shared
between the two teams.
In terms of technologies
it’s a bit different and it’s
mostly because of Intel-
lectual Property. Basical-
ly, Intellectual Property
contracts are much tighter
in F1 compared to the
automotive industry.
Also, not everything we
develop for F1 can be
applied outside of the field
to a completely different
product. But there are
transfers of technology,
there are meetings of
course. In terms of manu-
facturing, however, there
is much more sharing, es-
pecially in terms of actual
development techniques.
Grand Prix Racing is prohibitively expensive, top teams have budgets of around £400 million // McLaren
conference rooms, but
rather by clever software.
Heathrow’s scheduling,
for example, is decided
solely by a McLaren
“The idea of
the McLaren
P1 was to use
a similar type
of recovery
system [to that
in F1]”
Why your toothpatse, a Toyota Prius, and a McLaren
A car is, ultimately, just a pile of steel and aluminum
steaming ahead faster than a cheetah. Yet this clumsy
contraption can come to a stop in little longer than
the 50-kilogram animal. Who do we have to thank
– perhaps a safety officer in a lab coat? How about a
group of seemingly suicidal individuals from the 1950s?

“Toothpaste
production
and Grand
Prix racing
seem about as
unrelated as
two fields can
possibly be”
S
teel disc brakes,
like many other
technologies that
make today’s cars
so safe and efficient were
developed nowhere other
than on the racetrack.
Until a revised version
of the Jaguar C-Type first
took to the track in 1953,
drum brakes were con-
sidered the only practical
way of stopping a car.
Initially, disc brakes were
(literally) a hot mess that
melted on their drivers
at the worst possible
times. However, when
all kinks were ironed out
disc brakes offered far
shorter braking distances
and allowed Jaguar to
win the 1953 24 Hours
of Le Mans. In 1955 the
mass-produced Citroen
DS adopted disc brakes as
well and today you’d be
hard-pressed to find a car
without them on the road.
While steel disc brakes
have made their way
to just about every car
sold today, other tech-
nologies are only just
now beginning to impact
your average driver. For
instance, the carbon fiber
chassis that made Formula
1 slightly less dangerous
in 1981 has recently been
introduced to the BMW
7-series line. A carbon
fiber chassis allows for
lighter and therefore more
fuel-efficient vehicles
while offering uncom-
promising passenger
safety. Unfortunately,
the 7-series is priced at
upwards of £60,000, so
it may be a few more
years before light-yet-safe
constructions become the
norm.
More promising
advancements are being
made in electric and
hybrid powertrains,
which are used not only
in Formula 1, but also the
World Endurance Cham-
pionship and Formula E.
The current F1 engine
formula encourages
manufacturers to research
hybrid technology, result-
ing in small displacement
power units with state-of-
the-art energy recovery
systems that capture
energy under braking
rather than dissipating it
as heat – not too different
from the way a Toyota
Prius works (well, nearly
eight of them if power
output is considered).
Formula E powertrains
are even more interest-
ing. With the addition
of BMW and Nissan
joining Audi and Jaguar
among others for the 2018
season, the electric racing
series is bound to boost
the world’s transition to
electric cars. Formula E
teams all run the same
chassis and aerodynamics
package, instead focusing
on developing more effi-
cient electric motors.
Due to the swift devel-
opment pace, motorsport
is an extremely high-
budget venture as well
as a fantastic innovation
incubator and test bed.
While most teams rely on
sponsors to survive, some
teams have chosen to use
the innovative environ-
ment to their advantage.
The most notable example
of this is McLaren, whose
Applied Technologies
branch is what makes your
toothpaste more high-tech
than you might expect.
Toothpaste production
and Grand Prix racing
seem about as unrelated as
two fields can possibly be,
yet McLaren’s partnership
with GlaxoSmithKline
proves that a successful
Formula 1 team needs
to understand so much
more than just how to run
a car around a track. The
producers of Aquafresh
or Sensodyne, among
other healthcare products,
approached McLaren
in 2011 with a task of
making their production
line more efficient.An odd
query considering Glax-
oSmithKline produces
more toothpaste in a
few hours than McLaren
has produced cars in its
55-year history. Yet when
McLaren used the same
data analysis techniques
already in place in
Formula 1, they were able
to immediately identify
bottlenecks within GSK’s
production. The result of
the cooperation allows for
an additional 6.7 million
tubes of toothpaste
produced every year. The
ability to quickly and
efficiently sort through
data is so critical in F1
