On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me
Three French hens
You will need...
• 150g butter
• 100g sugar
• 2 eggs
• 250g flour
• 1 tsp baking pow-
der/baking soda
• Pinch of salt
• 1 tsp vanilla extract
• 1 tbsp cinnamon
• Boiled coloured
sweets
1. Mix the butter and sugar together un-
til creamy, then add the eggs in and mix.
Again, your best option here is a hand mix-
er.
2. Mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and
cinnamon in another bowl, and then slow-
ly add them to the butter mix. Mix with a
wooden spoon until the mixture has a bis-
cuit dough consistency.
3. Roll the dough and cut out biscuit
shapes (the more they remind you of
Christmas, the better).
4. Cut a hole out of the centre of each bis-
cuit, using a small knife or something sim-
ilar – you can add the offcuts and all the
misshapen results together and mix another
batch.
5. Place a sweet inside the hole and then
cook for ~15 minutes depending on your
oven – you want the sweet to be melted and
the cookie to be golden.
6. Enjoy!
W
e know that
nowadays,
when you
can Google
a lot of things, that you
don’t actually need all the
advice here. But hey, isn’t
it nice when you have
everything put together
by us? All you have to
do is save these pages,
and come back to them
whenever you feel like
cooking. Or, if you are
like me, pin them to your
kitchen board as a re-
minder that you should be
eating something a little
bit better than pasta. We
hope this guide gives you
enough Christmas ideas
to keep everyone happy,
enough places to go to
enjoy the wintery feelings,
and enough Christmas
gift suggestions to have
everyone covered.
EGGNOG
A partridge in a pear tree
Two turtle doves
You will need...
• 700ml whole milk
• 250ml double cream
• 5 eggs
• 3 cinnamon sticks
• 1 tbsp vanilla es-
sence/pods
• 1 tsp nutmeg
• 150g granulated
sugar
• 200ml dark rum
(I know you want
more, but you need
to keep it low for the
consistency)
1. In a saucepan, combine the milk, dou-
ble cream, cinnamon, vanilla (you can
choose to use either vanilla pods or vanilla
extract – personally, I prefer the latter be-
cause it’s easier to use), and nutmeg. Mix
well, until the mixture is homogeneous.
2. Bring to a boil. Before that you should
have a taste, to see if you want more vanilla
or nutmeg in it. It’s going to be more diffi-
cult to add them afterwards.
3. In a bowl, using a hand mixer, beat the
egg yolks and the sugar until they thicken.
4. Slowly add the milk mixture and con-
tinue mixing. Your final product should be
smooth.
5. Add the rum. Try not to add too much
rum. I mean, after doing this much work
you don’t want to ruin it.
6. Refrigerate. Before serving, beat the
egg whites till fluffy and fold into the egg-
nog until combined.

ust because they are a totally different thing to
gingerbread, you need two to have both – trust
me. Even if your family says “We don’t need
two kinds of biscuits!”, what else would you
give Santa when he delivers your gifts? Everybody
knows that you make biscuits for Santa! So you have
no choice.
THE BEST ADVENT CALENDAR
INNER CHEF
BISCUITS
T
o be clear,
this is not an
advertisement
for any com-
pany out there. But this
year I felt very nostal-
gic and I decided that I
should revive the child-
hood years when I used
to get advent calendars.
Should I mention that
I also used to eat them
in one day? Maximum
two, if I really felt like
I should wait until
Christmas.
Anyway, I wanted
to get one this year too
so on December 1st
I
started looking for them
– although I’d seen them
popping in shops quite a
bit earlier.
I must admit that I am
really impressed by the
diversity of advent cal-
endars in the UK – from
the ones that are dedicated
to makeup to those that
have fancy drinks. And
yet the best ones are the
classic ones that have bits
of chocolate. To rule them
all, Lindt does a calendar
that gives you a full
chocolate reindeer to
eat on Christmas day.
But there’s also a
Haribo one for those
who might not like
chocolate as much.
And there’s a Milka
one which is soooo
deliciously sweet.
I was not that im-
pressed by the Cadbury
one, and I haven’t tried
the Kinder one yet, but
the time will come. Yes,
I already finished four
of them and still have
some waiting for me.
And every time I felt
like a little kid again – I
must admit, I might
repeat this tradition
again.
Now go and treat
yourself to a chocolate
reindeer. Don’t wait
until Christmas.
