Some of the biggest tech announcements of 2017
2017 has been a bumper year for tech announcements;
from games consoles and smartphones to smart
homes – far too many to name individually, but here is
a selection of some of the biggest.

“Xbox One X
sales figures
surprised
many, selling
80,000 units in
its first week in
the UK”
M
arch 2017
saw the
phoenix that
is Nintendo
rise from its ashes with
the release of its new
console the Nintendo
Switch. Marketed as
a truly versatile game
console, the Switch
can be played in three
modes – TV mode for the
traditionalists who like
a big TV, tabletop mode
for when a big TV screen
isn’t socially acceptable
(the Switch comes with
its own portable screen)
and handheld mode – so
you can play anywhere,
anytime. A local multi-
player mode is included,
where eight people can
play together in a local
set up (MarioKart DS
memories). The Switch
boasts two handheld
controllers which can be
used when playing single
player, multiplayer or
when you just want good
ol’ motion control (just
like your trusty vintage
Wii remote).
Games include popular
titles like Mario Kart 8
Deluxe, Legend of Zelda:
Breath of the Wild, Mario
and Rabbids Kingdom
Battle and Super Mario
Odyssey. According to
September 2017 sales
figures, the Nintendo
Switch has been im-
mensely popular; selling
7.63 million units globally
at £279.99 each.
April 2017 saw the US
release of the Amazon
Echo Look. The Look
is essentially an Alexa
assistant with a voice
controlled camera. Its
purpose? Take photos/
videos of you in your fa-
vourite outfits and provide
suggestions based on spe-
cialist fashion advice. It
also helps you keep track
of your styles, colours and
the brands you wear – so
you don’t wear the same
thing twice! The Look
retails for $199.99 in the
US and is currently invite
only.
November was a
bumper month for tech an-
nouncements and releases;
ranging from the smart-
phones, and supercars to
high-end games consoles.
Microsoft released a
high-end version of Xbox
One – the Xbox One X.
A games console tailored
specifically for 4K im-
mersive gameplay with
spatial sound whilst being
backwards compatible
with the Xbox One. The
release comes alongside
exclusive 4K titles: Forza
Motorsport 7, State of
Decay 2 and Crackdown
3. Highly doubted by
critics for its focus on spe-
cialist gamers, the initial
Xbox One X sales figures
surprised many; selling
80,000 units in its first
week in the UK, outpacing
the PS4 Pro which took
four weeks post release to
reach similar numbers.
The world’s biggest
tech company Apple,
dropped a bombshell
(although there were
numerous leaks before-
hand) in November,
releasing the iPhone X
(“10”) – the 10th
anniver-
sary edition iPhone. As
well as being the most
iconic iPhone design in a
while, Apple decided to
ditch TouchID in favour
of FaceID, allowing you
to unlock your phone
and pay using just your
face. 2017 was the year
of shrinking smartphone
bezels and Apple pushed
the boat out by scrapping
the iconic Home Button,
replacing it with gestures
to access the home screen
and multitask. The iPhone
X also saw a design
revamp, featuring a glass
back – marking a return
for iPhones with cracked
backs and enabling
wireless charging for the
first time. Under the hood,
the iPhone X features an
A11 bionic chip which
can execute 600 billion
operations per second,
easily supporting new
features like Animojis
and portrait mode selfies
and lighting. Retailing
at £999, although quite
pricey, initial pre-order
iPhone Xs sold out within
ten minutes on release
day.
Announced in 2017,
but set to release in 2020,
Tesla blew many away
by announcing the Tesla
Roadster, an all-electric
supercar. The release
photos and videos show
a truly BEAUTIFUL
car. The specifications
themselves are objective-
ly incredible: reaching
0-60mph in 1.9 seconds,
0-100mph in 4.2 seconds
and a top speed of over
250mph. Many electric
cars are plagued by poor
range, but the Roadster
promises 620 miles on a
single charge. Supercars
aren’t great for families?
Think again… the
Roadster is equipped with
four seats and a retracta-
ble glass roof, wowing
adults and children alike.
Initial orders for the base
model start at $200,000,
better start checking for
that spare change behind
the sofa…
These were some of
2017’s biggest announce-
ments, but we saw many
other tech introductions
including the Google
Pixel 2, Google Home
series and Samsung
Galaxy S8 and Note 8 –
let’s hope 2018 is just as
great!
