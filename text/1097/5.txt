Sabbatical Hustings Not So Hot
Attendance was poor for the sab-
batical hustings on the South
Kensington site on Monday, with
only around forty students pre-
sent to quiz the candidates. The
candidates stuck closely to their
manifestos when making their
speeches, and none managed to
squeeze them into the strict time
limit. Questioning was dominated
by the medical stu-
dents present, the
on-going mergers
being the main sub-
ject. Doubts were
raised over the fund-
ing available for the
medical school clubs
as they move under
the ICU umbrella.
Other concerns
included accommo-
dation pressures and
social space in the
college.
Greater entertain-
ment was provided by
the session at Gladys'
at the St Mary's cam-
pus. Although there
was none of the usual
flan and baked-bean
throwing antics, lager
flowed freely and all involved were
forced to sink pints as fast as pos-
sible. Whether the ability to drink
quickly has any bearing on a candi-
dates suitability to perform the job
has yet to be assertained.
The medical clubs and societies
were once again the hot subject,
with Charlie Joynt (candidate for
Deputy President (C&S)) pledging
continued funding for all clubs, but
the two presidential candidates
less optimistic. M r Joynt also
showed some ignorance of current
funding sources, and had not heard
of the Astroturf Fund1
.
A great deal excitement was
generated by the issue of the
mountain hut formerly owned by
the St. Mary's Mountaineering Club.

Mark Baker believed in continued
priority for medical students, but
Andrew Heeps thought it should be
fully shared with all clubs.
Both presidential candidates
objected to tuition fees, though Mr
Heeps was less concerned about a
graduate tax, saying "As a gradu-
ate... you should have to pay for
what you have had", adding "I'm not
convinced that rallies do any good."
Mr Baker disagreed, and was
scathing in his opinion of the
Dearing Report, adding 'You could
have come up with it over a couple
of bottles of red wine at a middle
class dinner party."
As the effects of the alcohol set
in, candidates had to shout over
the noise and personal questions
were not thin on the ground.
^ w Andrew Heeps
was asked
whether he could
be trusted seeing
that "he bears
more that a pass-
ing resemblance to
[Dean] John
Caldwell", and
Mark Baker was
asked if he
thought that "body
odour was an
essential part of
the job." The can-
didates them-
selves were not
immune from
bloopers; M r
Bakers answered a
accusation of
being a 'yes-man'
by saying "I'm not
sure who the yes-
man here is. Yes.", and Mr Heeps
generated hilarity by mixing his
metaphors; "It's like the donkey and
the carrot", he said.
Voting takes place on Monday
and Tuesday in all departments and
campuses. You need a union card
to vote (get one from the Union
Office) and if you don't bother, we'll
come around and piss in your
shoes. Jeremy Thomson
