ACE/0
Starring: John Travolta
Nicolas Cage
Director: John Woo
F
ace/Off may have a strange
title, but it is one of the best
action films you will see this
year. FBI agent Sean Archer ( J o h n
Travolta) is out to get psychopathic
terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage)
who murdered his son. Troy is
captured but in a coma, meaning
Archer must become Troy via cos-
metic surgery, in order to locate
Troy's deadly bomb. In a gory
sequence, Archer and Troy have
their faces removed and Archer has
Troy's face put on his head. Archer
Nicolas Cage is the sadistic
terrorist... isn't he?
enters prison, not realising that
Troy has woken from his coma.
Discovering what has occurred,
Troy has the surgery performed on
himself and takes Archer's face,
before killing all the people who
knew that Archer was now Troy.
Archer must escape from prison,
recover his face and save his family
from a lunatic that everyone thinks
is a national hero
While this may seem like a con-
fusing premise for a film, it works
splendidly. The performances from
Travolta and Cage are superb, each
impersonating the other's walks
and mannerisms perfectly. The
supporting cast are also excellent,
but the main kudos goes to the
director, John Woo.
Finally allowed a free hand after
previous studio interference in his
American films, his abilities shine
as he shows what he can do with
his dazzling camera work, slo-mo
and choreographed gun sequences
in some of the loudest and most
exciting set pieces ever seen.
However, the film, while an action
thriller on the surface, has depth as
John Travolta
gives an
outstanding
performance
the two leads become more entan-
gled with each other's families,
coming to terms with the loss of
close relatives and with their
diametrically opposed characters.
This is the sort of high-quality
blockbuster you wish Hollywood
made more often. O

MY MOTHER'S
COURAGE
Starring: George Tabori
Pauline Collins
Director: Michael Verhoeven
M
ost films about the
Holocaust are based on a
true story and this one is
no exception. It centres upon a day
in the life of Mrs Tabori, a
Hungarian Jew played by Pauline
Collins. It shows her arrest during
Nazi Germany, her deportation to
Auschwitz and her subsequent
escape helped by a German officer.
This all happens in time for her to
return home and play Bridge.
The surreal nature of the plot is
echoed in the staging of the film.
Glibly described as a tragi-comedy
by the director, it features slapstick
and observational comedy
throughout. Whilst novel, the
homage to novel cinema seems out
of place in a film with such a
serious theme and detracts from
the impact of the story. This is
symptomatic of a seeming unwill-
ingness within the film to tackle the
unpleasant questions raised by the
Holocaust. Narrated by Mrs
Tabori's real-life son, we are given
the impression of a naive house-
wife unwilling to come to terms
with the reality of her situation yet
this is completely ignored in the
narrative. The film has a surprising-
ly lightweight feel and ultimately
suffers from trying to cover too
much in too little time. O

In which John Woo
film did |ohn Travolta get straight
to the point?
Last week we asked "In which sleepily titled film did Lwan McGregor
reveal all?"
The answer was not Sleepless in Seattle, which may have the right title
but didn't actually feature McGregor. Neither was it Trainspotting which
may well have featured the Scot but certainly Isn't sleepily titled It was
in fact. The Pillow Book, a little-noticed film released two years ago.
The following four people win a poster, t-shirt and book from the "must
see" A Life Less Ordinary:
