UMDS III v ICFC III
We made our usual casual start but
eventually we got the important
breakthrough when Simon took on
their left back, cut inside and slot-
ted it into the corner. We were
then denied a blatant penalty when
John Silva was hacked down in the
area - the ref just looked away.
Things looked as though they were
about to turn nasty, but Andy
Murphy calmed things down with a
thirty-yard screamer which was
too hot for their deeper to handle.
After some soul-searching at
half-time, we turned in a great sec-
ond half. Darren scored quickly
after coming on and Tony surged
through to score another. Andy
Bellis stole in at the far post to
head in another great corner deliv-
ered by James. Then the fireworks
really started. Simon added anoth-
er to his season tally and Andy
Bellis finished off a lovely move to
make it seven. John Copp scram-
bled another and Andy Murphy got
the ninth.
Despite a late consolation goal
to deny Ricky another clean sheet,
we went home with the points to
keep up their great record in
BUSA.
UMDH 1 - 9 ICFC III
ICWBC v UCL
On Tuesday the ICWBC put an
end to UCL's series of wins by
beating them 39-36 in a crucial
ULU match. For our ladies, this
victory is a big step towards
becoming ULU league champions
for the second consecutive year.
Special credit goes to Anne-
Gaelle P. whose particular devo-
tion to defence led to her being
was forced off the court by a
nasty nose injury, and to Pat D.
for her great shooting. Thanks
also to Zoe for great timekeep-
ing. The girls are playing for the
ULU cup, the ULU league, and
should qualify shortly for the next
round of BUSA. If you are an
experienced basketballer and are
interested in playing for the team,
it might not be too late! Please

Running
ICXC v BRUNEL
Imperial runners gave another
strong performance as the cross-
country league moved into the
deer populated Richmond Park.
Despite missing key personnel, IC
made a strong challenge on the
awesome Brunei.
I'd like to say Ben Hukins
looked like a Greek god with his
long hair flowing behind, though 1
can't because he looked like a girl
(he still came sixth). Chris Fishlock
may look like a choir boy but he
runs like a gazelle and finished
eighth. Demetrius, always the
crowd's favourite, improved on his
last race to finish fifteenth.
In the women's, Jenny Cox fin-
ished and then read War and
Peace as the places came in.
Bethan Hipewell made an impres-
sive return from injury to finish
third.
Once again IC took a large
group of runners and all their per-
formances were appreciated,
especially the twelve-and-a-half
stone beer monster (aka Grant)
who was just pipped in a sensa-
tional sprint finish.
(p.s. Don't forget training and
races on Wednesday).
King's I v ICBCI
Fortunately for IC, the mistakes of
the match against KCL were not
repeated. This time the IC tall guys
were able to clear many rebounds
in tough conditions and there were
many more alternatives from the
guards, too. Even though IC were
heading for most of the match
(first half ended 39-33 for IC), the
fouling out of Elias Iliadis and some
hasty decisions at the last minutes
of the game gave the right to
Q M W to almost win the match.
The three shots of Guillermo San
Miguel 40" before the end brought
the match to extra-time (73-73).
There, IC being more determined
and avoiding any mistakes won the
match by a difference of nine
points which may save they from
any complications in their race to
the qualification for the knock-
outs.

Rugger
ICRFCII v
GREENWICH)!
They were big, ugly and they smelt!
And we told them so!
The Seconds, having altered
slightly this week, were again vic-
torious. Play was good, although
not to our usual magnificent stan-
dard. The backs played well, how-
ever they're going to have to stop
rubbing 'vas' on their hands. The
forwards had difficulty getting their
arses over the rucks but both backs
and forwards got their acts togeth-
er and the team integrated, leading
to some dominating moves which
produced results.
Numerous players were com-
mended but good kicking from El
Capitan and noted work from
James Robinson (player of the
match) and too many others to
mention created space, time and
led the way to victory.
Dave Best played well on the
wing making ground. Our game
needs work but we played consid-
erably well. Bloody hell Eddie, we
won again! Well done boys!
ICRFC II 15 - 7 Greenwich II
Skiing
Saturday saw the first ski race of
the season. Fielding nearly two
teams we set out in the hope of a
top ten finish. After the first round
of races we changed our ambitions
to just finishing a race.
In the second session of racing
Imperial I began to show their tal-
ent, by not just finishing, but win-
ning races. By now all but two of
us had been involved in accidents.
Imperial II easily beat
Greenwich I. A joint Charing Cross
I Imperial 1 UCL ladies team pro-
duced the best I.C. result of the
night by finishing second in the
ladies league.
Particular praise must go to
Alex Z. for 'most spectacular crash
of the night' (first and second
place) and Gilles for "take it nice
and steady" just before crashing
out against Charing Cross I.

Imperial should contact Caitlin

Editorial
What a busy week it has been,
cats and kittens. So much sport
and only two pages to put it all in.
Apologies to everyone who's
reports aren't in this week - best
attempts will be made to include
everything relevant next week.
I have had comments from
several quarters about the fact
that reports are being included a
week after they have happened.
From this week, the back page will
be finalized on Tuesday evening
and the second (and third?) page
on Wednesday, due to a new
printing schedule. What is needed
if the topicality of these pages is
to improve is more help. Thus, if
you feel your sport is not being
done justice then e-mail
felix@ic.ac.uk and offer your help.
Finally - the hockey club is
starting a fourth team, If interest-
ed, contact Paul at p.bland@ic
