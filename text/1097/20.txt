hree weeks ago possibly one
of the most important events
in the computer gamers'
diary passed without a whimper
from the press. The Quake2 beta
was posted on ID Software's (the
darlings of the games industry) web
site and was quickly mirrored
around the world. After a suitable
period of time to deliberate, cogi-
tate and digest on this latest offer-
ing, the Quake community now
speaks.
Wolfenstein, iD's first success-
ful game, almost single-handed
opened up a new genre of comput-
er gaming. The 3d-1 st-person view
gave a much greater feeling of free-
dom and the not so politically cor-
rect humour made for a fresh and
exciting game. ID then ^
followed up by the leg-
endary Doom which «

shifted the setting from
a Nazi Castle to a
futuristic base,
dropped in a load of
genuinely scary nasties
and gave you a meaty
arsenal of weapons to
destroy them with.
What really kept Doom
(And all it's sequels on
various platforms)
going was the ability to
'Deathmatch', to play against other
people and, as anyone who has
more than a passing nod with mul-
GAMES
tiplayer games knows, it is so much
more satisfying to blow up some-
one living hundreds of miles away
who you've never met, or even bet-
ter, your friends. What also added
to it's longevity was the fact that
anyone with the inclination could
create their own levels thus ensur-
ing that iD could focus their atten-
tion to their next project rather than
diverting precious resources to
providing support for the existing
user base.
When it was released, Quake
inspired a new generation of fanat-
ics, not least because of the
enhanced multiplayer facility but
also because, in addition to being
able to create your own levels you
could also completely change the
source code allowing programmers
to add extra weapons and change
the rules of the Game.
Despite it's commercial suc-
cess, Quake did draw criticism for

Quake 2 improves on Quake in
many ways, at least on paper. The
monsters are more detailed and
not having a plot. There was a short
story posted explaining your
motives but basically the premise
was, run, shoot, kill, solve puzzles.
better animated. They are also
smarter and provide a more gen-
uine challenge as opposed to the
'pump as much lead into it before it
kills you' mentality of the original.
The cosmetics have been
improved; there are more colours
on screen and the water is trans-
parent on all computers not just
those running OpenGL graphics
cards and there is dynamic,
coloured lighting. There is also a
story line of sorts, mostly seen by
viewing animated cut-scenes
through a window, and to aid this
the levels have been designed to
represent buildings rather than
labyrinths where the only objective
was to get from A to B alive.
On the down side the game is

slower, at least on low end
machines, not only because the
graphics engine has been beefed
up but also because iD have taken
the controversial step of optimising
the routines for high-end PCs rather
than those with more modest sys-
tems. Modifications
will also be more diffi-
cult since the old,
easy QuakeC has
been replaced by the
more powerful and
flexible but ultimately
more difficult to pro-
gram DLLs (Dynamic

tion has been mixed.

Others have countered that this
was only a compatability test, not
meant to represent the final prod-
uct, others have said that it has no-
where near the amount of "WOW"
factor that the original did. The
debate will continue to rage until
the final version is released and
probably way on past that.

Z
is one of those games that
you're going to love or
you're going to hate it. At
first sight I personally hated it, but
after experiencing 3 hours of solid
'battle', I loved it. The story line
behind this game is a straightfor-
ward one: you are the commander
of an robot army, and the objective
is to kick the crap out of the enemy
and eventually destroy your
enemy's main fortification. During
the process of 'ass kicking', you
have to capture pieces of territory,
in which are factories. These facto-
ries can make more robots and
other goodies such as guns, tanks,
etc.
At the beginning of each level
the game play is pretty tense

though eases off a little after you
have a sufficient number of robots
and military vehicles to defend
yourself. The key to success in 'Z'
seems to be having the correct
weapons and troops at the correct
position and at the right time. Since
both robots and vehicles can only
move at an incredible slow rate,
you could find yourself having a
dozen or two robots being blown to
bits before your light infantry can
rescue you from losing your entire
robot army.
In general the game is quite
easy to play: it doesn't take long to
get the hang of the controls even
without using the manual (the man-
ual is quite thin and not that
wordy). The snap shots between
levels are quite cool and fun to look
at, however there are few variants.
'Z' also has a large sense of
humour: within the game when you
are about to lose the battle, the
commentator of the game would
say 'you are crap', 'you are hope-
less' just to give your morale a
boast.
If I have to make a comparison
between this game other strategy
games, 1 would say other strategy
games such as 'Red Alert', 'Counter
Strike' are the legends (just like Star
Trek Next Generation) and Z would
be a spin-off of such a strategy
game (similar to Star Trek Deep
Space Nine!!!). It is definitely worth
thinking of buying but 1 wouldn't
place your hopes too high. O
