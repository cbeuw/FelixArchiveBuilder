MUSIC NEWS
irst up this week
there is a message
from Trevor morgan
about the up and coming dance
pages. Take it away Trevor...
Starting next week is the ulti-
mate dance music guide. Yes, we
will be digging deep down under-
ground to bring you the cutting
edge of London's underground
dance music scene. We will be fea-
turing reviews of London's most
innovative clubs. Vinyl reviews for all
you budding D.J's. Plus the odd
compilation and mix CD's we think
are worth a listen. In the near future
we hope to bring you some inter-
views with some of London's top
D.J's, producers and promoters.
Also we need some people who
are willing to review clubs for us, if
you interested in a free night out.
Mainly week nights. Contact me
Trevor on Ext. 55685, 45632 or
drop me an e-mail at t.j.mor-
gan@ic.ac.uk.
Incidentally, just in case any
of you were missing Milen and
his vibe just skip to the nest page
where he gets a slightly larger
platform to shout from. El

The Candyskins are the bunch
of lame indie chancers whose first
album you'll probably find for 99p
in the bargain bin at HMV. They
have changed their style somewhat
from the early days progressing
from tuneless dirge to more chart-
orientated pop. The crowd was
small and mostly uninterested

pie who seemed to know all the

The 'skins twatted out a bunch
of bouncy tunes that seemed to
have been recycled from 60's pop
songs that no-one really liked any-
way. Their hit - Monday Morning
was the high point of the evening
and to be fair it's not a bad tune
and some of their songs with a
softer feel worked fairly well. Their

\mAL struck me was the lengths
that they had gone in order to cre-

Sratic. Every inch of the wall was
covered with 10 root luminous
posters of alien faces and mystic
symbols. Two huge projectors
beamed psychedelic images onto
circular screens, whilst hundreds
of lasers chased each other
around simulations of extraterres-
trial warfare which looked suspi-
ciously like something from a
Playstation. But my favourite of all
stage props was an eight foot
brain which flashed and buzzed
throughout the entire gig as if it

Halfway through the night, a rub-

her way across the stage on robot-

her arms and her legs. She walks
back and forth inciting the crowd,
raising her robotic extensions to
