FEATURE 7
As I write, President Clinton
has just ripped up what is left of
the Rio summit commitments,
abandoning his

pledge to cut
carbon dioxide
emissions in the
year 2000 to 1990
levels. The reason
given, in typically
|3Â» Orwellian fashion, is that
the US is somehow a
'special' case - that is they
are a bigger polluter,
accounting for 22% of the
world's carbon dioxide
emissions, and therefore
have greater difficulty in
complying. This signals a
little substance. But the reality is
that a major power shift has
occurred. The combination of the
information revolution and an
obsession with free trade, has cre-
ated a situation in which the bal-
ance between national govern-
ments and big business has
changed. For example, the World
Bank has calculated that of the
100 largest definable economic
units, only half of them are coun-
tries, the rest businesses. The
implications of this trend are con-
siderable and there is much to be
said about the threat that such
powerful business interests poses
to our democratic institutions. But
rather that focusing on that, I

complete U-turn, as
up until a few weeks
ago Clinton had kept up
high profile support for
the Rio targets. However,
under stiff opposition from
If the business community,
which has spent millions on

playing on the fear of job inse-
curity, he crum-
pled. So yet
again, Clinton star-
tles us with his
power for reinven-
tion. The aggressive
free-marketeers call
the shots and Clinton's
interventionist poli-
cies end up in the
bucket.
It is easy to
ridicule the
Democrats, and
New Labour for that
matter, for the ease
with which we have
moved from the
Reagan-Thatcher era
to the Clinton-Blair
era, with so much
rhetoric and so

nesses are at present
churning out ethical state-
ments. Business 'ethics'
has become as much of a
buzz-word in the nineties as
'down-sizing' was in the eighties.
Undoubtedly, the substance of
these 'ethical' guidelines varies
considerably. There are broadly
three different categories, which
could be defined as ' fundamen-
tal', 'tinkering' and 'green-wash'.
On the positive side, there
have been notable successes of
businesses which have man-
aged to consolidate their mar-
ket position by putting
into place far reach-
ing and highly
accountable standards of
business practice - the 'fun-
damentals'. The most
obvious example in
m m Britain of this funda-
mental approach is the
success of the Co-
operative Bank.
In the middle there
are a number of com-
panies who are at pre-
R o u l e t t e . . .
would like to consider how this
change has altered the way busi-
ness perceives itself, and plot the
rise of business ethics.
Traditional wisdom is that busi-
ness operates within the rules of
society. In other words, society
contains business so the ethics of
the society are the ethics of busi-
ness. But what if a business is so
powerful that it is bigger than the
society in which it is based? Who
decides what the acceptable limits
are? This a very crude model of
what is happening right now. An
internal crisis has been generated
within the business community
itself as decision makers increas-
ingly find that traditional bound-
aries of good practice are ineffec-
tual. Relying on external discipline
is no longer tenable. The conse-
quence is that with the zeal with
which the nineteenth century
sent 'tinkering' with the mecha-
nism of their business structure.
Examples include B&.Q's work with
the World Wildlife Fund, to analyse
the sustainability of their timber
sources, and the positive noises
coming from certain supermarkets
following Christian Aid's campaign
to establish guidelines for the
working conditions of those pro-
ducing food in the developing
world.
On the other extreme there are
those who are blatantly 'green
washing' their organisations with
the help of their publicity depart-
ments. There are too many of them
to list, but as a general principle
keep away from anything that has
no third party monitoring or alter-
natively has Linda McCartney's sig-
nature on the front.
Perhaps the greatest steps for-
ward have been in the financial
sector. 'Ethical Investments' in
Britain now account for billions,
and most building societies now
offer such policies. E1RIS, the only
firm of Independent Financial
Advisers who offer advice on
Ethical Investments in this country,
are turning away work. However,
the importance of the ethical
financial sector is not simply it's
size but it's far
reaching influ-
ence. One of
the most
effective ways
of altering
business practice is to refuse to
lend money on 'ethical' grounds.
It is for this reason that the
campaign to form an ethical policy
for the USS pension fund (that of
your lecturers) is so important. The
fund is worth 13.5 billion pounds
or more than double the total of
ethical investments in this country,
so could have an enormous influ-
ence on financial practice. Also, as
the pension is guaranteed by the
government, such a change would
have no impact on the pension
that individuals receive. (1 don't
pretend to be an expert on this
matter but if you are the kind of
person who is, someone would be
delighted to speak to you at the
contact address below). So what
would such an ethical policy
include? As a model, the Co-oper-
ative Bank's is an excellent starting
point.

the bank will 'actively seek out'
organisations which promote posi-
tive environmental steps, fair trade
and generally will try to work with
those who conduct business activ-
ity from an ethically consistent
standpoint. These are the most
woolly parts of the policy but also
the most important as they define
the business culture.
There is nothing very radical
about this policy, in fact, I'm
sure that I could have ham-
mered it out with my
granny over a cup of tea.
But it is a good start, and
where there is 13.5 billion
pounds at stake it is cer-
tainly worth doing.

Contained within
the ethical policy are a
number of different
kinds of statements.
Firstly, there are the
general clauses
concerned with
basic standards.
On a general level
the bank is com-
mitted to not
invest in organisa-
tions which under-
mine human
rights, damage the
e n v i r o n m e n t
excessively and
sell arms to
o p p r e s s i v e
regimes (whoever they are). Other
'forbidding' clauses include ones
on much more specific issues like
the tobacco trade and animal
experimentation for cosmetics,
and specifically in the area of
finance there is clause which for-
bids speculation on the pound.
The rationale for this is that the
bank would be profiting at the
expense of its customers, the
British taxpayer.
All the policies 1 have noted so
far are the passive statements,
those that set up a framework
within which the bank acts as a
moral arbiter; a list of criteria
which all borrowers must comply
too. But the Co-operative Bank is
also committed to nurturing good
practice. Contained within the pol-
icy are statements of intent that
