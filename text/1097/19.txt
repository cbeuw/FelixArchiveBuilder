his film has Demi Moore try-
ing to act without the benefit
of half decent script or gratu-
itous nudity. Doomed from the
start really wasn't it?
Put bluntly: The acting is wood-
en, the characters stereotypes, the
budget must have run... ooh, into
tens of dollars (virtually the entire
film is shot in an army camp, all of
which looks decidedly like the
same piece of land with a different
wall/fence/obstacle on it), the plot
cliched and the moral dubious.
Plotwise, a sharp female
MAXIMUM
RISK
Starring: Jean Claude Van Damme
Natasha Henstridge
Director: Ringo Lam
politician wants women in
line army service, the top
don't. Much politicking results in a
'test case' solution - if the female
candidate survives the tough
training, all women can take part in
killing on an equal opportunity
basis. Like I said, hardly inspiring.
Needless to say, the evil military
bosses try to make Gl Jane fail,
none more so than her insidious
commander, played by an excellent
Viggo Mortensen. On cue, just to
prove that sexist Uncle Sam isn't so
bad, along come the Arabs (the
sort of gun toting mullahs that live
in Hollywood minds) to get their
ass kicked. Demi Moore's shaved
head isn't the only ugly thing in this
film. •

W
arning! The first five min-
utes of this film will strike
terror into the hearts of at
least half the campus. After the
finals exams are over, however, we
meet up with the five people sin-
gled out from the exam hall, and
find out that they are friends, some
more intimate than others, who
apart from wearing weird clothes
and sporting strange hairdos, also
share a passion for a cappella
singing. Student life, it would
appear, just has not changed. Every
cliche is thrown in, but you still end
up saying, "Yeah! I know someone
just like that!"
We move from the late
seventies to the mid-eighties, and
find our friends at a wedding of
one of their own. The conversation
concerns the usual things; "How's
the job", "You've lost weight", "You
haven't", "How can you possibly
marry that twerp?". It is this last
question that we are left pondering
as we move to the mid-nineties
and discover how the group has
turned out.
The film is an adaptation of a
successful stage production and
provides a regular supply of chuck-
les along the way. There are sever-
al moments of intense personal
relationships, but the mood is soon
lifted by the beautiful a cappella
melodies. The cast are big-screen
newcomers, but do justice to the
characters, and the fact that they
are primarily actors who can also
sing is a bonus, since a genuine
sense of enthusiasm is conveyed to
the songs. Colourful and beautifully
shot, this is an ideal film to
cheerfully while away a couple of
hours. Q

rash! Bang! Wallop! Jean-Claude Van
Damme single-handedly levels a whole
market with a vegetable-delivery scooter
before causing it to become airborne and land-
ing on a passing car. CRASH! He rescues his
best friend from a flaming van just before it
goes BANG! He beats the crap out of evil
Russian assassin Red Face no less than three
times before finishing him off with a knife in the
guts WALLOP!
And there it is. You see, although Maximum
Risk does have all the ingredients that real films
have, like actors, a script and a storyline, you
end up wishing it didn't .
The story revolves around Alain Moreau
(Van Damme), a French ex-marine who is now a
detective in the south of France. One day there
is a bit of a ruckus, apparently caused by a
corpse with its legs sticking out through the bro-
ken windscreen of a car. Lo and behold the
cadaver has exactly the same chiselled features
as our hero. By a brilliant piece of intuition Alain
realises that this is his identical twin Mikhail
from whom he was separated at birth and who
was a big-time gangster on the run from the
brutal Russian mob (no really!). Sensing some-
thing fishy going on, Inspector Moreau decides
to travel to New York in order to get to know his
late sibling by discovering who killed him. En
route he gets in cahoots with his brother's girl-
friend (Natasha Henstridge), breaks loads of fat
bald guys' wrists, and discovers that his broth-
er was a kind, generous and compassionate
gangster who only killed people when it was
absolutely necessary.
The action sequences in the film are very
competently handled, and the suspense and
interest are maintained for the whole 100 min-
utes, although I suspect that this is partly to do
with the audience hoping that the rather fragile
plot will stay intact until the end, which it does.
It must be said that the acting falls a little short
of Oscar material: Van Damme has spent years
honing his interpretation of a bit of cardboard
and Henstridge is there purely to add some
nudity to the proceedings.
If you go to see a film like this with your
critical functions intact you are bound to be dis-
appointed. If you go drunk, stupid or merely
willing to have a laugh, then you won't be.
Much. •
