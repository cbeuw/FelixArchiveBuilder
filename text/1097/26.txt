SPORT 7 November 1997
R o c k s a n d e s k i m o r o l l s
A fairly normal late Friday depar-
ture, after the usual late attendance
of the driver and thus the trailer,
led to a late arrival in Dartmoor,
mostly caused by large numbers of
traffic cones. Finding the bunk barn
empty of other people was a defi-
nite bonus. After a good sleep,
breakfast was accepted with mixed
enthusiasm, those on their first trip
ignored the suggestions that they
should eat all they could, clearly
failing to appreciate how long it
would be until tea time.
With a little panic over how
many paddles we had brought
along, and some minor distractions
in the form of a large trailer pro-
claiming 'Dagger Boats - free trials',
we managed to get on the river
Dart (after Garth floated his boat
down on its own) to spend some
time teaching Whitewater basics
before setting off.
At this water level (a bit low)
there was little to worry anyone,
and so we had a good first run,
with only one swim (previous trips
have netted about 10 swims in one
worry than us, as he spent a good
while upside down before rolling.
Most problems were found in the
shallow rocky sections, and Nicky's
A canoeist eagerly rushing back for his dinner
descent). The few good bouncy
rapids were well negotiated, a cap-
size from Dean causing him less
tangle with a tree won't be some-
thing she wishes to repeat soon.
Quite by accident we were
down in the car park and getting
ready to paddle before 10 o'clock
(no one noticed the clocks went
back an hour) on Sunday.
A little unauthorised Demo boat
borrowing led to Garth getting into
trouble with the bloke in charge.
The day's first run was done at
super speed, with no swims, and
minimal playing around (until the
bottom, where jumping off the
bridge was taken up by anyone
loony enough), leaving us plenty of
time for a second. Not the most |
serious paddle ever, the Topo Duo I
was wheeled out and our resident I
river psychos Colin and Sam went "
charging down the river, until they
swam at Triple Falls.

Footie sex-deities in orgy of gorgeousness
ICWAFC v RFH
At last a full team, with a last
minute random (ex-footie Bud
"The Spod") flown in from Paris
to make up the numbers.
Tensions were running high, with
Royal Free being evil hussies
from last year. 5 minutes into
the first half and Scribbler shot
and through sheer goalkeeping
brilliance, the ball trickled though
the keeper's legs. Pressure was
intense for the rest of the half,
but amazingly no more goals.
Lily and the Spod suffered facial
injuries but we birds are so hard
they carried on playing.
The second half saw a
change of keeper, Baldrick for
Hacker Lyle and it has to be said
the Royal Free attacks were as
scarce as their good looks. Wee
Marisa, Nadia, Amy, Jo and Lili
pushed hard for the elusive sec-
ond goal but it never came.
Staunch defending at the back
by Freud and Hedge ensured we
stayed ahead.
The birds first real win to
date. Now to get slaughtered on
the Hammy Ten. Seriously,
though, a lot more commitment
needs to be shown if we are
going to get any results this sea-
son. But still, well done everyone!
ICWAFC 1 - 0 Royal Free
ICAFC IV v Q M W IV
Although hoping for the season,s
first victory, the fourth's winless
record was sadly intact at the final
whistle. This was a game we
should have won, indeed it was
described as our worst ever result.
Somewhat over the top, but it
aptly describes the passion con-
tained within the fourth's foot-
balling folklore, and after the game
the spirit was as good as ever.
Captain Quick unfortunately
received his marching orders from
the over-zealous official who
penalised the passionate player.
He was surely unfairly singled-out
in a mass brawl at the final whistle.
The official thought that he had to
take action and the captain seems
to have been the scape-goat.
Stuey spent the game on the side-
line, and after stepping onto the
pitch one time too many bawling
instructions was sent by the ref to
the serenity of the changing rooms
for the previouly unheard-of crime
of refusing to leave a football
pitch. All good fun, though.
The goals were scored by Ryan,
playing the best football of his
career and Mike, coming out of
retirement. Also, Darren "Darren"
Boland in his first game since
march wasn't very good.
ICAFC IV 2 -2 QMW IV
QMW II v ICAFC II
Despite a disgraceful pitch and a
Q M W student ref, with a virtually
unchanged squad there was a
quiet confidence about our team.
Unfortunately, just like last week,
led to some complacency and a
stupid early goal for them. The
first half continued with Phil, Dan,
Jesse and Loz in defence winning
every header that came their way
but the midfield and attack failing
to penetrate. The ref didn't seem
too bad and didn't mind both
teams kicking lumps out of each
other.
Captain Dan's half-time team-
talk of "Get in the six-yard box,
lads" worked wonders and within
ten minutes we had scored two
well-worked goals calmly finished
by Pistol Pete - not a bad debut.
With the defence still untroubled
we began to push home with the
midfield pushing forward - excel-
lent work from Felix, as usual, and
also Steve who seems to be com-
ing to terms with the physical
aspect of the English game.
Patrick was fouled in the area on
one of his mazy runs but as he
didn't fall over the ref declined to
give us a penalty. Worse was to
come.
Q M W equalized against the
run of play with a goal that 'keep-
er Chris "Scouse" could do nothing
about. Their team sensed that they
could hold on, and so did the ref
with his decisions becoming more
and more blatantly biased as the
minutes went on. Martin was
through on goal to break his four-
game barren spell and was brought
back by a ridiculous offside deci-
sion. Pressure from the Q M W play-
ers and the heckling of the sup-
porters on the sideline was obvi-
ously influencing the ref who insist-
ed on having a linesman to give off-
sides against our forwards, but not
assigning a second in our half.
In this game the cheats didn't
prosper, as Phil - who had been
superb in defence all game - punt-
ed the ball high into their area and
it landed just in the top corner of
the goal. Their defence was being
ripped apart and finally killed off
ten minutes before the end. Felix's
long throw bisected their defend-
ers and with an assured air Si put
a beautiful looping shot from over
their advancing keeper. Surely the
goal of the season thus far.
So, with three wins on the
trot, a place in the next round of
the cup, injured players returning
this Wednesday, good team spirit
and a spectacularly good-looking
side, IC seconds go marching on
to glory.
