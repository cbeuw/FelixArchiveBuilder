Like Johnny Ball,
this man can
easily be confused
with Cod.
SOUL, HIP-HOP AND NO STOP
First up - Will Smith, tha man or
just another fucking sell out. For
me he's a bit of both, 1 give the
man 'nuff respect for being the
biggest black star of this genera-
tion but does he have to released
this weak arse, pop-tastick, just
for the masses bullshit. Well yes
actually because he earns him
mo' money and guess what he's
doing it again with the release of
his latest single fust Crusin' on
November 17th this'!! be another
huge commercial success, but
probably won't be getting any
serious club play. Havin' said all
of that Will's new album is soon
to drop with production by some
of the largest hip hop names
Puffy, Trackmasters, Jermaine
Dupri and Warren C, so what's
up? Maybe he just is tha man!
Y'all can all make your own minds
up. -Stop Press— Just in that Will
is signed up to play Muhammad
Ali in a film of the boxers' life. So
it seems Mr Smith does fly like a
butterfly (weak shit) but stings
like a bee (tha good shit).
For all of y'all who are straight
up West Coast till I die, there's
some light at the end of the tun-
nel. For a time Death Row lay
stagnant; the loss of Dr Dre and
Tupac's death along with the

A
complete anthology of
British pop history, this C D .
is the Ben-Hur of all albums.
Embracing musical styles as diverse
as traditional aboriginal and psy-
chedelic rock, these twelve tracks
feature ten covers ranging from
modern day to way back into the
early sixties. It is indeed an album
of great sophistication and virtuos-
ity, the triumph of modern music.
Okay, that's rubbish! But then
again it's by Rolf Harris and he
plays the wobble board on it, so
what other reason can you pos-
sibly need to buy it? It is the ulti-
mate kitsch album ever, and is a
definite must to anyone who thinks
they're hip or has a sense of
humour. Rolf Harris has to be the
most loved tit ever to have existed.
Perhaps it is the fact that he never
stops smiling, or the way he man-
ages to talk to everyone as if
they're six years old that does it.
Why do people still like him? How
long has he been around? And
exactly how much acid does the
man use?
imprisonment of Suge 'Baseball
Bat' Knight was just too much to
bear. But they're back and
crushin' all before them. Just out
stateside is Death Rows Gang
Related - The Soundtrack and its
gone straight in at number one
over there. The film is the final
big screen appearance of 2Pac, a
shame really 'cause he was show-
ing some real talent in this direc-
tion (just check Poetic Justice
and even Gridlock'd). The LP is
full of killer tunes, a couple of
really dope tracks from the man
himself (RIP) along with support
from Snoop, Kurupt, Nate Dogg
and Mack 10.
Staying on the West Coast the
heir to the Tupac throne has still
not been decided, Snoop is the
frontrunner with most people
believing that his next joint will
wrap it up. He had better be
quick though because my
sources, on the other side of the
Atlantic, say that the long await-
ed joint from Ice Cube is going to
fasttrack tha man to the number
one spot on the West Coast. The
double LP is titled War & Peace
and should drop in the near
future; more details when I get
dem.
Back to the present day and
None the less, this album does
indeed dabble into a bit of every-
thing, and Rolfs rendition of Alanis
Morrisettes's One hand in my
pocket is truly brilliant. Fit with gig-
gling vocals, neat ambient sound
effects and even a sneaky little lyri-
cal twist, the track is a true classic,
bound to crack you up. Another
favourite of mine is A girl like you
(yes, the one by Edwyn Collins)
which features Rolf on those bril-
liant vocal effects that sound as if
he's playing with himself and a solo
on the jaws harp that could have
come straight off Jimi Hendrix's
Strat. In fact, 1 was very impressed
with Rolf's musical capabilities, (if
you can believe what the sleeve
says about the number of instru-
ments he plays on the album).
As if all that isn't enough for
your money, there's even a version
of Lou Reed's Perfect Day, So go
on, go out and buy the album, and
if you don't like it, you can always
give it to your kid brother. CI

as per usual it's my job to go
through the mountains of crap
that the record companies
release and bring forh the real
gems. Tha first ladies of hip-hop
bring us a monster track entitled
R U Ready, if this doesn't get you
singin along go home. Changing
Faces have at last got round to
releasing / Got Somebody Else
this mid tempo track doesn't give
anything new but it sticks in your
head and for dat is worth check-
ing. Another monster doing the
rounds at the mintue on US is
You Should Be Mine by Brain
Mcknight with rap by Bad Boy
Mase, this is better than good it's
a fucking eight ball single.
Speaking of Mase, this Bad Boy is
dropping his ablum soon, it
seems that Puffy has decided to
flow the market with Faith and
the Lox also dropping theirs in
the near future. Tha Bomb simple
as tat, Mr WooHa brings
Dangerous the second release
from the LP When Disaster
Strikes both show be on your
checklist, will blow up on the
dance floor.
'Nuff from me, remember to
check the column next week. Love

Yesterday, Tomorrow,

here's not really much to be
said about this album. In
fact, there's about eleven
twelfths less to say about this
album, than most twelve trackers.
Why? Because this is essentially
one track - one forty minute track.
Yep, you did read correctly, this is
only a forty minute CD and, for a
tenner, this isn't quite enough.
Yesterday Tomorrow Today, is
not ground breaking, revolutionary
or specialised in any way, but it is
something that will no doubt sell
by the bucket-load.
Style-wise, think of Ash and...
no, on second thoughts, just think
of Ash. Tempo, lyrics and guitars
could all have been lifted straight
from Ash's recording studio, and
placed onto this CD. While this is
no bad thing, as with Ash, if you've
heard one song, you've heard
them all. This is perfect backgroud
music, something to fall asleep to.
And that's it. Ther seems to be a
distince lack of energy about the
whole thing.
Everything you'd expect from
the current phase of band music is
here but, as I've already said, noth-
ing really distinguishes any track
from any other. In fact, they could
all quite easily fit into the back-
ground of many an Aussie tea-time
soap, a fate that is becoming more
prevalent among British bands.
Yesterday Tomorrow Today is
very much middle of the road Brit-
Pop, but good middle of the road
none the less. Unfortunately,
'good' is the only word that can be
used to describe just about every
element of the album. Nothing
stands out for notable compliment
or criticism.
If you like Ash, buy it. If you like
Northern Uproar, even better. If
you're looking for a bit of variety,
forget it. El
Derek
