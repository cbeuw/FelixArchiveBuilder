London Students
Out on the Street
Students from Imperial College
were involved in a demonstration
last weekend, following the
Government's proposal that
future students will have to
contribute towards the cost of
their university education.
The rally, on Saturday
1 November, was organised by
the University of London Union
(ULU) and the National Union
of Students (NUS). Despite the
apparent lack of publicity,
around thirty students from IC
met in Beit Quad and subse-
quently attended the event,
including IC Union President
Eric Allsop, who caught up with | | |
the body of the march at a rally
in Hyde Park.
The assembly was enter-
tained by a budding comedian
from Royal Holloway and
Bedford College, before the
release of nine hundred and
ninety-nine black balloons. It
was intended that these should
signify the extra Â£1000 per year
that would be imposed upon stu-
dents by the introduction of tuition
fees. However, the authorities had
placed un upper limit on baloon
release of one thousand. The
march then proceeded slowly
through central London to Trafalgar
Square, drawing attention from
both tourists and locals alike.
The demonstration was also
attended by a delegation from
the Socialist Worker, who adver-
tised a similar protest next
month, and various flyers were
handed out advertising marches
all over the country. Many fac-
tions of the NUS were evident,
H with some flyers calling for "fresh
II leadership in the NUS". President
of the NUS, Douglas Trainer has
been accused of "jumping ito
bed" with Labour politicians
rather than taking action against
fees. He was not in attendance.
Despite hopes of ten thou-
sand people attending, it is esti-
