Editorial
It may seem like poor show, but
this week I'm subcontracting out
to a guest editor. The resons will
become clear. Take it away...
It's a sad fact that people are more
likely to complain than actually do
something. This week that's been
demonstrated by the number of
complaints about Felix. "It's not as
good as last year..." people whine.
Actually, the first issues last year
were shite. 1 know, I was there. The
job of a Felix editor is not an easy
(or desirable) one. Until a few more
people get off their bottoms and
come into Felix to help proof,
write, and otherwise create our
jolly newspaper, we'll all have to
suffer the occasional mistake.
Not wishing to add to the gen-
eral College-bashing that seems to
be going on at the moment, but I'd
just like to make a slight complaint,
about the Health Centre. It does
indeed have a lovely new home,
and its far more pleasant to wait in.
The reception staff are very friend-
ly and helpful (and one of them
really looks like the reception guy
from Casualty - weird). I'm sure
also that the Doctors and Nurses
are of the highest quality.
However, when will something be
done about the waiting time? It's
hard enough to drag oneself out of
bed and get there at 8:30am, and
diabolical to wait an hour and a half
to see a Doctor. To cap it off, this

herculean waiting time was fol-
lowed by a two minute consulta-
tion which led to the conclusion
that the Doctor had no idea what
was wrong with me at all. The solu-
tion? Not to worry about it, and
come back another day - although
this time I have an appointment.
Indicentally, did you know that
Mark Baker was recently arrested
and held in a Police cell, presum-
ably for being so drunk, although
he can't remember why he was
arrested. Which probably confirms
our presumtion.
In the interests of fair play and
unbaised election reporting, it's
only right to point out that Andy
Heeps led the Scout delegation to
the British Youth Parliament, which
is a fact that somehow seems to
have been missed from his mani-
festo...
Oh, and New Election is a right
old pile of poo. I mean, do we real-
ly want a Union at all? Why the hell
do people keep voting for another
election? Jesus Christ, why not just
bend over and let college * * * * us
up the butt. The overall effect is the
same.
Finally, in a comment that will
definately be edited out, may I just
point out that Eric Allsop is a X
