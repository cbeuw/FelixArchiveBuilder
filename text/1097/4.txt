Orange is the youngest player in the mobile
communications industry, yet already established
as the one with the brightest future.
From a standing start in 1994, we're now really flying.
Within two years we had connected our 500,000th
customer. Now we have well over a million...
and climbing.
Innovative technology allied to imaginative marketing
has been our secret. The quality of our wirefree digital
service, and the excellence of our customer support,
owe everything to our RF and Telecomms Engineers,
Network Designers and IT Developers.
In 1998, more graduates will be joining our Engineering
and IT training schemes than ever before. If you're
interested in joining a company which thrives on new
ideas and encourages everyone to stretch their
imagination, don't miss our presentation coming to this
campus. For details, look out for our posters or ask your
Careers Service who will also provide a full brochure.
You can also take a closer look at Orange on our web site
www.orange.co.uk which has an on-line application

The future's bright. The future's Orange.
