Letters to Felix...
OKAY SO WE
FORGOT TO
PROOF A REVIEW
Dear Felix,
I am, like many others, I think,
a regular reader of Felix, especially
since last year when Alex Feakes
made a splendid job of the whole
thing. An equally large number of
people, however, enjoy denigrating
our illustrious newspaper; strange-
ly - perhaps someone could
explain this to me some time -
these never seem to be people
who feel any inclination to con-
tribute to it. Still, there is nothing
wrong with honest criticism: I think
as with all newspapers there is
bound to be some interesting stuff,
some less enthralling, some well-
written, some less well.
Forgive me if 1 have taken too
long getting to the point of my let-
ter, which concerns the theatre
review of issue 1096 (p.21). May I
offer you my heartfelt thanks for
the amusement this article afford-
ed me. (It is second only to the
staggering "Letter from Across the
Atlantic" of 3 Oct.) This case surely
deserves a prize for its sixteen, yes
sixteen, misprints (three of which
in the same sentence) - higher bid-
ders?. I was at a loss that someone
could find a play "extremely flinny
[sic]" (on three occasions), refer to
"seeraingly [sic] endless situations",
and talk quite casually of "grateflil
[sic] respite". I would never have
thought such slips of the pen (I use
the expression tentatively) even
remotely possible.
Mr. Matt Williams, or whoever
the typist was, thank you, whoever
you are.
Yours quite sincerely
Iannis Deschamps (Chem3)
PS. Steady with the caffeine, lads.
Dear editor
I have just finished reading the
theatre review for Closer at the
National Theatre written by Matt
Williams. 1 lost count of the spelling
and punctuation errors in his
review once they reached double
figures. May I suggest that "Closer"
proof reading is encouraged by
yourself in future!

Dear Felix,
1 feel that it is about time
someone addressed the issue of
the standard of Felix (or lack there-
of). This year, Felix has began an
intellectually terminal descent into
what seems to be a bottomless pit
of drivel. The "news" articles and
features are increasingly sub-stan-
dard and littered with spelling mis-
takes (computer programs known
as spell checkers do actually
exist!). Try reading Matt Williams'
recent article from the perspective
of a foreign student. It seems as
though Felix is being created by
people who have neither the time
or talent to do it properly. As one
of my friends described the lastest
issue (Felix #1096); "The Sport but
without the tits." 1 think that just
about sums it up. Is there such a
real lack of news stories around
College that it necessitates the
inclusion of such (albeit lightheart-
ed) shite as the "Naan-Bread-O-
Meter?" Or are you simply waiting
for people who "have some news"
to phone you, as requested on the
front cover (of issue #1096)? 1
shudder to think that Felix is man-
aging to break last years standards
of mediocrity. Even Simon Baker
was unusually tame; his reactionary
rhetoric is one of the few things
that does spice up Felix (even if I
do agree with it personally). Need 1
also mention the infamous book-
store incident? Obviously, that was
such a minor story it was neglected
from Felix until the College had
made a decision on the matter,
leaving all students to simply
accept what had happened.
However, despite this (somewhat
major) oversight, the previous Felix
team seemed to have at least
established standards which you
are not upholding, or are even
aware of.
Now, you may well level the
disclaimer, "if you don't like it, then
piss off and do it yourself," at me.
This is all well and good, but I have
never claimed that 1 could run Felix
unlike yourselves, who abviously
think you can (otherwise why are
you on the Felix team?). Please
improve the standards for the sake
of the sanity of all students within
College.... otherwise we'll have
nothing to do during morning lec-
tures on a Friday.

LOAD OF BALLS
This is about Jon Trout's article
"The Two jonnies"
I wanted to thank Felix on part
of Third World First for publishing
Jon Trout's article "The Two
Jonnies". This article raised issues
which are very seldom heard of at
1C, such as world poverty and the
damage done by TNCs (Trans
National Companies).
Nevertheless I found (like a few
others) that Jon Trout used this
article more as a platform for his
immense ego (e.g: "The two
Jonnies") and failed to really give
credit where credit was due (which
is bad journalism). Johnny Ball was
invited by Third World First to give
a lecture (not just a "meeting") on
Oxfam. From Jon Trout's article you
could just about think that he invit-
ed Johnny Ball himself to have a
pint! It might seem that we are try-
ing to get into the limelight of
Johnny Ball, but all I would have
asked was for a little recognition,
such as mentioning that TWF
organises such talks on a regular
basis (every two weeks minimum),
and perhaps a contact address?
The whole idea of inviting
Johnny Ball was to get people inter-
ested in Third World issues, who
normally wouldn't have been, but
were allured by the prospect of
seeing their childhood hero first
hand! Anyway, we are still very
grateful that Jon Trout wrote this
article. Maybe if we get Zoe to
come down next time Jon Trout will
give us more cred!
