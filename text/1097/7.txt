EVEN MORE LETTERS
7 November 1997
DEMONSTRATE
Dear Felix,
I'd like to say a big thankyou to
everyone from IC who attended
the NUS demonstration against the
introduction of tuition fees. This
demonstration, supported by iCU's
Labour Club, marks the start of a
large campaign which 1 urge all 1C
students to get involved in. For
those who missed the demonstra-
tion, don't worry - the Campaign
for Free Education has called a
national demonstration for the 26
November. I hope there will be an
equally good turnout from
Imperial!
Yours, George Constantinides
Dear Felix
As ICU students may or may
not know, there was a demonstra-
tion in London on Saturday the 1 st
November against the
Government's imposition of tuition
fees. All of the ICU officers were
invited to go at the ICU Council,
and some of them did.
However, only about thirty
people overall went from IC. The
1CU delegation was therefore out-
numbered by SOAS, SSEES, Kent,
not to mention LSE, UCL, King's
etc. This is good empirical evi-
dence for the "Imperial College of
Science, Apathy and Con-
formation" theory.
Although not all of the Imperial
delegation stayed to see the whole
event, those who did thought was
a good start to what will hopefully
be a successful campaign.
Yours Sincerely

ACCOUNTS ARE
AN OPEN BOOK
Dear Felix,
I was most distressed to read
in this weeks Issue (No. 1096) that
Simon Baker's perception that the
Union finances were secretive and
unavailable to the light of public
inspection. ICU has copies of the
audited accounts available for any
member to come and read and
myself or the finance manager will
answer any questions about the
accounts. It is a legal requirement
for ICU to provide this information
to any student who asks and I am
more that willing to do so. I have
enclosed a copy of the Union
financial statements for the year
ended 31st July 1997.
Yours sincerely

MOANING OL' GIT
Dear Mr. E.Felix,
I have had enough. I can't toler-
ate it anymore. Something had to
be said. Here goes:
In my first year, I was a conifer.
Being like all the other conifers in
the forest of IC, I went to dB's on a
Wednesday and friday night quite
often. Now I am an fully grown
larch in the second year, and have
returned a couple of times.
Unfortunately things have not
moved on. The crux of the problem
is that the Dj's in dB's ALWAYS play
the same music. PLEASE, PLEASE
can they change - become up to
date, more real dance music. LESS
Pulp - Disco 2000 et al. Can they
please grow up, enter the real
world, and play something differ-
ent.
I'm not the only one with the
problem, most people are fed up
with it too. I think that it is indica-
tive of the 'regime' in the Union
Ents. dept. They always seem too
eager to accept complacancy.
Where's their imagination? Where's
the flair?
Please can they do something
different to what has been done
before. Nothing too groundbreak-
ing, don't worry, just a change to
the tedium. I hope the right people
are reading this.
Good Luck,
Dave Edwards.
Dear Mr. Jeremy,
I wish to register a complaint.
Y O Y R the onion selling their cur-
ries at £1.10?
"The infamous £1.10 curries"
Doesn't quite have the same ring to
it, does it? [See how it glows, rest-
ing in the bowl]
Are they going change them
back to £1 curries like in the ol'
days, or do I have to shut up?

ENERGY
CONSERVATION??
I would just like to ask those in
sherfield who think they are on an
energy efficiency drive why chem-
istry lecture theatre C has been
consistently heated to gas mark 6
since the beginning of term. It can't
be the most energy efficient for
people to be sat in a lecture, with
the windows open, wearing only
shorts and a T-shirt and still feel
like you've been bannished to the
center of a desert during a heat
wave. My advise to them would be
to fit thermostats designed for
rooms rather than ones they nicked
out of catering's ovens.

WHOSE FELIX IS IT
ANYWAY?
Dear Jeremy,
On the front cover of Felix this
year you're describing it as "The
Students' Newspaper at Imperial
College". I'm writing to say that I'm
not really happy with this descrip-
tion, for two reasons:
1. By saying "The Students'
Newspaper" it sounds like you're
implying there is only one student
newspaper at IC. This isn't the
case. There are of course all the
CCU productions. Whatever your
opinion of them (and some of
them are vastly superior to others),
they are newspapers produced
for and by the students of Imperial
College. [This is the hacky and/or
pretentious argument. My real con-
cern follows below]
2. By saying "The Students'
Newspaper AT Imperial College"
you're not making it clear where
the funding for the paper comes
from. I'm sure many people will
take that as meaning IC directly
fund the paper, which is not the
case as far as I know - it says inside
Felix that it is "produced for and on
behalf of Imperial College Union
Publications Board". Now that all
the clubs and societies are being
forced to (quite rightly) state that
they are clubs of Imperial College
UNION, I don't feel it's right that
the main publicity item produced
by the Union doesn't. I know Felix
is free of Union control in that
you're allowed to say "The Union is
shit" if it is, but it is still funded and
housed by the Union and this
should be made clear.
I apologise to anyone reading
this who thinks I'm a sad old hack
who needs to be shot. I just feel
that we (the Union) needs to make
clear what we own. Stating our
ownership and our committment
to the provision of a sen/ice may
stop us from losing that service.
We don't have another bookstore,
and we can't afford to lose anything
else. College is very unlikely to ever
try to shut down Felix, but the prin-
ciple still applies.
Yours sincerely,
Helen-Louise Windsor

Dear Helen,
I spent a lot of time over the
summer considering this byline
and I'm glad you brought up the
7
subject.
Your first point is
easy to answer - Felix is
the only cross-college
newspaper.
The second point is more
complex. In many universities,
the newspaper is directly
accountable to the union and
often the college. The editor may
print only what they see fit, and
is often a Union Officer them-
selves. I want to stress that Felix
is not controlled by the Union or
the College, but by the students -
hence "The Students' News-
paper" (notice the position of the
apostrophy). It is true that
around half our funding comes
from the Union, but we could
hardly call Felix "The Students'
Newspaper of Imperial College
Union, JP Morgan, British
Aerospace, SBC Warburg..." I
don't really care where the
money comes from - it's the con-
tents that are important. Your
last point, though, is spot on.

OOPS...
Dear Felix,
1 am afraid that you have been
significantly mislead by the
College's published Financial
Statements. The graph you showed
last week which showed a loss of
£79,000 by Conferences for
1995/96 does not reflect the real
value that is created by the
Conference Office as most of the
operating surplus falls into the
accounts of the Residences and
Catering operations.Your estimate
for 1996/97 is wrong, on the same
basis it would be £38,000 positive.
For the year to 31 July '97, the net
income after all costs, for confer-
ence activities exceeded
£750,000. This contribution has
more than doubled in the last two
years and is being ploughed back
into the fabric of the College,
including the refurb of Evelyn
Gardens and new furniture for the
JCR . I am aware that the presen-
tation of the accounts in this man-
ner is most unhelpful but we are
constrained in our accounting
treatment by the Funding Council
so to avoid such misunderstand-
ings in the future, we are omitting
the relevant page from the forth-
coming Financial Statements.
Nothing sinister in this honest.
Best wishes
Mike Hansen
Director of Finance
