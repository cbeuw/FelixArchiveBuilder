7 November 1997 COLUMNS
Revenge at last. That is how many
left-wing Conservatives must view
the latest sorry developments in
the party, which has exposed its
first major split since the move into
Opposition. The subject is nothing
new - Europe. The dissidents cer-
tainly are, ex-cabinet heavyweights
such as Michael Heseltine and
Kenneth Clarke have attacked the
leadership's anti-European stance.
The particular subject in question is
the little-known Amsterdam Treaty,
which the Government supports
and is guaranteed to get into law.
The Tory leader, William Hague,
intends to oppose it utterly, and
threatens to impose a three-line-
whip (where MPs are forced to
vote at all costs) to do so.
Treaties are the building blocks
of European integration, the greater
ones being the Treaty of Rome, the
Maastricht Treaty and so on.
Amsterdam is not quite as signifi-
cant as these, but is still an impor-
tant piece in the European puzzle.
It is precisely the sort of bone of
contention that neatly divides the
Tories - to Labour's delight. In the
leadership election held in the
wake of the General Election defeat
in May, the two eventual candi-
dates, Kenneth Clarke (represent-
ing the left wing) and William
Hague (representing the right)
stood.. An immediate 'Anyone but
Clarke' campaign including such
grandees as Margaret Thatcher her-
self, and triumphalism on their part
when Hague won, even though he
was considerably junior in age and
experience. This created bitterness
should just resign now, rather than
continue generating tension. This
could be a sensible way to show
he's tough without too much real
response needed, since shadow
ministers will always want to keep
an eye on their jobs. However this
policy could also be a mistake. If a
number of ministers call his bluff
and resign, it will create a rump of
Hamish Common
Westminster
Eye
on the left, as they saw their own
views being marginalised in the
party's policy-making. The final
ingredients of the contentious
European Treaty and the sharp
divides on this that had been
papered over previously, caused
this row to surface.
Hague has responded to the
present altercation with a hard-line
view. He says that those ministers
who disagree with him on the issue
capable pro-europeans who will be
able to oppose the leadership at
will in the way the 'Euro-rebels' did
so effectively, helping in the last
Government's downfall. The pro-
europeans will have little problem
in helping in Hague's. Clarke
announced that if the "Shadow
Cabinet wanted to changed the
party policy of the last thirty years,
it can't conceivably imagine that
people who've been in office for
years and years, taking a
different view, were going
to agree." On the other
hand, Thatcher is marshalling her
forces and speaking in the Lords,
supporting the leadership, and has
already criticised Clarke and
Heseltine for their disloyalty
(although what she was doing with
John Major during his term of P M
was hardly continuous praise).
So what long-term relevance
does this have? The question of
Europe bores the pants off most
people, its distance and irrelevance
to us as contributing factors. Silly
laws and 'anti-British' decisions add
to general despair, all in all few
people are positively interested in
it. This may be fine, but to ignore
the issue completely is dangerous.
The shenanigans of our politicians
in these affairs, especially on the
single currency, will affect us con-
siderably in the time to come. It is
an issue few of us have the time,
the expertise, or the patience to
understand. Let us hope our elect-
ed representatives get this one
right for a change.

Chicken and Mushroom Pie
Say one day you fancy
roast chicken. So you buy your
chicken, roast it (375째F, 190째C,
gas mark 5, 1 hour plus 10
minutes per lb over 21b), eat a
drumstick and a piece of breast
but can't finish it because you
forgot to ask some friends
round. Then it sits in the fridge
for a couple of days and sud-
denly you panic because you
won't finish it before it goes
off. Well, here's what to do
with the rest.
Tear all the pieces apart,
strip the meat from the bones
and put it aside. Make a stock
with the carcass, the bones
and skin. This involves putting
all these bits and pieces in a
pan, covering with water,
adding pepper, salt, a couple
of bay leaves and whole
cloves, bringing to the boil and
simmering for 1 Vz hours. Then
sieve the stock so that you are
ieft with just the clearish liquid.
Whilst the stock is boiling
away, prepare the other ingre-
dients. Make a dough by mix-
ing 8oz flour with 4oz fat (suet
or butter, the former is
extremely unhealthy and hence
very tasty) and a pinch of salt
and then adding enough water
to bind everything together
into a smooth paste. Putting a
large pinch of mixed herbs in
with the flour gives extra
flavour.
Now cut the meat into
small (1/2") pieces, thinly slice
1 /21b of mushrooms, dice one
small turnip and one small
parsnip into very small cubes
and mix all these bits in a bak-
ing tray or casserole dish.
Season with salt, pepper,
mixed herbs, a bit of chilli
source, whatever you fancy.
When the stock is ready,
pour some onto the meat and
veg so that the liquid comes
about half way up the mixture.
Roll out the dough and place
on top, pressing the edges
against the sides of the dish to
seal it. Cut a small hole in the
middle of the dough to stop
the pie exploding and making a
mess of your oven. For a flashy
finish you can glaze the dough
by brushing some egg white
onto it.
Finally cook the pie in the
oven at 400째F, 200째C, gas mark
6 for 30-40 minutes or until
the crust is nicely golden.
