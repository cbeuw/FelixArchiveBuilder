10 COLUMNS 7 November 1997
Trouble at mill, lad. The
EMU saga rumbles on,
though the mood and pre-
text for debate appears to have
changed slightly. As time goes by,
the feeling seems to be 'when'
rather than 'if. This is all very well,
since it removes an element of
confusion, but it also serves to sti-
fle debate on the fundamentals of
the project. If the British public are
constantly told that the key ques-
tion is timing, they will soften their
opposition to the single currency,
deprived of the relevant informa-
tion. Labour's affirmation of uncer-
tainty is driven by the belief that
they would not win a referendum
before the next election, and has
little to do with economic consid-
erations. The Conservatives have
ruled out membership for 10 years
in the hope that it will given them
a quiet life for the time being. Of
course, this is a forlorn hope, with
rampant Europhiles like Peter
Temple-Morris in the party. The
real question is whether it is a
good idea in principle- will it ever
work? By delaying decisions, we
are left not knowing whether that
decision has really been made.
This is naturally not an easy thing
to resolve. Support and opposi-
tion, despite what young Mr Blair
tries to tell us, cut across party
lines. It is certainly true that the
ayes are in the ascendance, princi-
pally because of the difficulty of
opposing the
New Labour spin
blitz. Eurosceptics
are seen as jingo-
istic lunatics,
somewhere in the
social order
between child
molesters and
Imperial College's
student journal-
ists. To argue
c o n v i n c i n g l y
against EMU does
not require
recourse to the issue of sovereign-
ty and Her Majesty's image on our
coins and banknotes, very impor-
tant though they are. The vital
point about EMU is the loss of
control of interest rates and the
inevitability of a common fiscal
balance sheet for Europe. The
removal of currency exchange is
not the clinching argument. If you
believe in monetarism as both
Labour and the Conservatives
seem to, the loss of interest rate
control by a country or its central
bank is economic and political sui-
cide. Nobody has convinced me
otherwise and I
doubt they ever
will.
Very dis-
tressing news
has just reached
me. Many of you
youngsters may
not be familiar
with the Holland
Club in Sherfield.
Nothing to do
with clogs,
f—^ mind. This is the
n o n - a c a d e m i c
staff social club, providing good
food at very reasonable prices. As
a postgrad, I can choose between
there and the SCR. I have not
eaten in the SCR for 18 months. All
in all, this is a very successful ven-
ture. Hence my fearful disbelief
when 1 heard that College Catering
wish to get their filthy paws on it. 1
know of no surer, quicker way to
screw it up than by absorbing it
into this cost-unconscious, over-
staffed, overcharging department.
Moreover, it beggars belief that
plans are afoot to expand Catering
at precisely the time they should
be looking to rationalise and priva-
tise the existing set-up. This is a
recipe for disaster, if you'll excuse
the pun.
Finally, I'll slip into Anne
Robinson mode for a minute (no
sniggering at the back). Now is the
time when Christmas parties are
being planned and restaurants
being booked. M y own recent
experience suggest that Da
Mario's on Gloucester Road
should be avoided, on account of
their tendency to cancel bookings
if bigger and better parties arrive
on the scene, claiming a double
booking. You have been warned.
