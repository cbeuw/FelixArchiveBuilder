SPRINGS A LEAK
Last Friday water could be seen
pouring down on to the main
walkway as a pipe in the mechan-
ical engineering building burst.
Between noon and one pm a
considerable amount of water
cascaded from the building caus-
ing some concern. Security was
alerted and after investigation the
culprit was found to be a burst
steam pipe on the fifth floor. It
was found that the pipe cracked
due to the strain put on it when
the central heating system was
switched on. An electrician was
called in to examine the area to
prevent a potentially hazard situ-
ation evolving.
Very little damage was
caused by the leakage as the
water only seemed to mainly run
through the outer shell of the
building.
The advent of winter has
caused similar incidents such as
these around the college.

Applications fall
Imperial seems to have been
sheltered so far from a drop in
applications that has left UCAS
recipts down by 1
6
%
. The fall is
being blamed on the government's
introduction of Â£ I OOO-per-year
tuition fees for students starting
their courses next autumn.
There were 5570 applications
to undergraduate courses at IC
after three weeks of the UCAS sys-
tem being open. This is down 5.6%
from the same period last year,
when there were 5899. The 'home'
student applications, which come
from the group affected by the fee
introduction, were down 7.9% from
last year.
David Atkins, Senior Assistant
Registrar (Admissions) said that he
thought this sort of fluctuation was
Dohii
"quite normal", adding that the
applications last year were up by
3.9%. He also commented that
there seemed to be a systems fail-
ure at UCAS over the last week,
that had left applications numbers
seem "very low".
The majority of early applica-
tions have been for Oxford and
Cambridge candidates, and it is
reported that the applications for
Oxbridge (which have now closed)
are down by 9%.
There are various theories over
why the applications numbers are
down. One is that potential stu-
dents are being put off by fees, and
so are choosing not to go to uni-
versity for fear of running up huge
debts. Another is that many stu-
dents who would have applied this
year after a year out came to uni-
versity without taking a gap year in
order to miss the fees. However,
confusion still surrounds their intro-
duction, with some suggesting that
the fees will apply to all in universi-
ty, regardless of the degree start
date.
Imperial College is officially not
in favour of fees, but any fee intro-
duction would be across the board.
Mr Atkins added that Imperial
is more interested in the standard
of applications than the number,
and that "the academic quality of
the students applying to the col-
lege is as high as ever."
