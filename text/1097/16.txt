Galore it it it v2
The all new
Cure! (cheerful-
ness somehow
included).
N
o, no this is not a brand
new Cure album as in total-
ly new material, but it is a
collection of their singles from
1987 to 1997, the most recent
being the Jesus Jones-ey sounding
Wrong Number that has just
recently been released. You could
consider this as their follow up to
the previous singles collection
Staring At The Sea, ('79- '85).
If you've got most of their
albums then you'd probably have
heard all of these tracks anyway
but if not, then this is a perfect way
to get some of their most cracking
tracks. Some of the more out-
standing ones are Fascination
Street, and the absolutely fantastic
Just Like Heaven which alone
makes this album worth getting.
Pictures of You is another gem
worthy of a mention, along with
the three singles off Wish, which
Friday I'm In Love is undoubtedly
the best. There are a couple of
rather dubious sounding pop
efforts in the form of Why Can't I
Be You, though the quality of the
rest of the songs helps you to for-
get about these minor blemishes.
Basically this album contains all the
Cure songs you've heard, you may
not know them all by name, but
you will after a listen, d Jason

orrect me if I am wrong, but
why is it that none of these
tracks has been more publi-
cised. This is probably because
these are pretty mediocre offerings
from the king of the club scene. I
love Moby's old stuff and 1 was
really looking forward to hearing
this album but unfortunately it
turned out to be a bit of a disap-
pointment, not to say that all of the
tracks are bad, as there are some
that recapture his old brilliance.
The first thing I have to mention
about the album is the phenomenal
amount of bullshit printed in the
sleeve. I don't think that anyone
apart from a trained politician, or
possibly a maths lecturer, could
write something so unintelligible
and still expect people to read it.
The James Bond remix of the
original theme tune is quite catchy,
but may offend true fans of Bond
as it has used Pierce Brosnan's
voice for those immortal words
'My name is Bond, James Bond'
(cue strong but knowledgeable
glance).
Then there is Moby's offering
for the soundtrack of the Saint.
'What?' I may hear you ask, 'Moby
did a track for the Saint?'. Now 1
am sure everyone has heard the
Orb's contribution, which was
actually quite good, and is now
wondering why they didn't know
Moby was on there as well. It's
simple, the track doesn't hold a
light up to that of the Orb and
deserves to remain unknown.
Guitars have become more
prominent in Moby's work and he
has used them in a few of these
tracks. Now in one song they are
put to good use, but in the other,
well I can hardly bring myself to talk
about it, they are painful to listen
to. Imagine your Dad's favourite
Status Quo chorus double it and
you will be getting close to the level
of cheezyness involved here. All I
can say is why? CI

Ladysmith Black Mambazo - Inkanyezi Nezazi
(The star and the wiseman)
Who? The cover, similar to a Heinz soup can
label, should have told me. This pleasant
African tribal chant music is the theme from a
Heinz TV ad. Unlikely to have the success of
jeans ad music but never the less this is a love-
ly mellow tune. Ideal music for those lazy
Sunday afternoons or maybe even a bowl of
soup!
Foil - Reviver Gene
A fantastic strong guitar sound propels you at
high speed through this tune which is combined
with an excellent vocalist to complete the expe-
rience. A definite must have will be their debut
album Spread it all around. Look out for these
guys they deserve to do well.
Cath Coffey - Tell Me
Gentle soulful lyrics with a synth beat box back-
ground. Fairly inoffensive and plain tune which
is likely to appeal to people who don't care what
they listen to. The b side contains a couple of
re-mixes by A Guy Called Gerald and Steve
Osborne. They manage to add a bit of flair to
the proceedings but unfortunately some lyrics
still remain.
Tin Star - Disconnected Child
A gentle drum beat with a hint of trance in there
somewhere slowly combines and builds into an
excellent tune with perfectly timed highs and
lows. Lyrics are skillfully and unobtrusively used
to top it all off. Definitely worth buying espe-
cially for the b-side which is a longer and,
undoubtedly, better mix. Unlikely to be a chart
success but should get a bit of attention in club-
land.

Beck - Deadweight
Beck has produced some excellent original
music in the past. So it is no surprise that this
is yet another. Funky lyrics backed by a myriad
of instruments skillfully packaged into a master-
piece Taken from the soundtrack of the recent-
ly released film A Life Less Ordinary,
Deadweight is bound to take the chart by storm.
If I hadn't been given a freebie I'd be at the front
of the queue to buy this one.

Dawn of the Replicants - Rhino Rays EP
The first track , Radars, on this four track EP
starts off with a melodic distorted guitar intro
and then progresses into a more discordant
sound in the same vein as Subcircus. However
the rest are pretty average on the whole.
Flyscreen - / Wanna Be In A New York Punk <
Band
Another four track EP with three tracks under
three minutes long, very punk indeed. These
songs aren't exactly hard hitting punk but only
about halfway there, and soon lose their appeal
after a couple of listens.
Pulp - Help The Aged
There was a rumour floating around that Pulp
were only going to release this single in Help
The Aged charity shops so that it wouldn't qual-
ify for a chart position. Top idea. It is a typical
Pulp track with Jarvis being his usual witty self.
SFA - Demons
This is a really soothing mellow track that kicks
in at the chorus, a real pogo-er. Although the
last single from SFA wasn't much cop, this one
shows that they've still got a bit left in them.
