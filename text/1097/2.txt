VPs in the Spotlight
Students of ICSM had their first
chance to put forward their views
to the new ruling elite of the med-
ical school hierarchy during the
Vice-Principals Question Time last
Monday. The session took place at
St Mary's Hospital and was chaired
by Professor Michael Whitehouse,
Vice-Principal for Under-
graduate Studies. Also in
attendance were Dr Malcom
Green, Vice-Principal for
Postgraduate Studies,
Professor Rory Shaw, Director
of Medical Education Unit,
and the Deputy Secretary of
ICSM. Notable for his absence
was Dean Professor John
Caldwell, who was away in
Japan.
One of the principal con-
cerns of the medical students
present was the availability of
house jobs for inalists under
the matching scheme.
Compared to St Mary's, the
former Charing Cross and
Westminster Medical School
provides fewer pre-registration
house jobs. This has led clinical
students from St Mary's to worry
that competition for such posts
would intensify in the foreseeable
future. In response to this, Dr
Green assured them only Mary's
graduates would be eligible to
apply for positions at Mary's for the
next few years.
It was established during the
question time that most people
thought it fair to have separate
graduation ceremonies for the
MBBS and BSc graduates. One sug-
gestion was to graduate qualified
school was also discussed.
Students were informed that the
college did not object to the med-
ical school having their own logo so
long as it was not in the form of a
shield, as this would turn it into a
coat of arms - heraldic regulations
only permit Imperial College to
ond year clinicals from St Mary's
that they would not be given a
room in hall when they become
finalists next year, especially when
they return from their electives.
Many of the penultimate-year stu-
dents present believed that they
had been guaranteed final year
accommodation when
they enrolled. However,
Professor Shaw claimed
that they had only been
promised 'priority'. No
one present was able to
clarify whether postgrad-
uates from other disci-
plines would be given pri-
ority over final year
medics in Wilson House.
Overall, no firm com-
mitments were made by
the Vice-Principals. This
was in considerable con-
trast to last year's session
where many promises

Shortage of accommodation in
South Kensington this year resulted
in some of the non-medical fresh-
ers being housed in Paddington.
This has led to worries among sec-
doctors of medicine with post-
graduates from the South
Kensington campus (MSc and
PhD), who currently have their own
ceremony in the spring.
The badge of the new medical
and the next session is expected to
take place over at the Charing
Cross campus before Christmas.

An Apology
Last week we published a graph
showing the annual surplus/loss of
the trading account of the
Conference Centre. The figure for
the year 1996-97 was incorrect.
This was due to us confusing the
budget (-£59,000) with the actual
figure (£38,000 surplus). Apologies
for this error.
Although these figures were
taken directly from the Imperial
College Annual Financial
Statements, it has been pointed
out that they do not give a fair rep-
resentation of the performance of
the Conference Office as they are
interlinked with the catering and
residence accounts. For more
information, please see the letter
from Mike Hansen, Director of
Finance on page seven
