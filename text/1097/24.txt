The Man With The Ten Bob Note - Part Two
A story by Buz Barstow
That of course was before now.
He'd been falling, that was for sure.
He'd now landed, and woken up on
a rock near a pool of hydrocarbons.
It seemed awfully familiar, and when
he cocked his head, he realised
why. The outpost was only a few
hundred meters away, and there
was a pod outside. He'd been res-
cued, they'd come just in time. It
was unusually calm for the day of
reckoning though. Not wanting to
argue he staggered back to the out-
post. It had been four hours since
he climbed up to that elevation.
Strange then, that the clocks in
the outpost should show it was the
day of his arrival, 3 days earlier. That
didn't matter, the prospect of res-
cue was more appealing than the
timing mystery. He wavered
towards the landing pad. No rescue
party was there for him. The pod
was his. He turned around, towards
the lounge area. The door was
open, the lights were on. The
woman was on the red sofa he'd
placed her on, and nearby was a
man in a flight suit. It was him.
It was him. He'd just walked in
through the door. He, I, looked ter-
rible, covered in oily sludge. Can't
be me. He looked startled. I looked
startled. We raised our right hands.
Can't be me.
The man in the new flight suit,
me? It is me? "Go, now, take the
woman!" I screamed. I don't know
why I said that. It excluded me.
Perhaps I felt excluded already.
"Name? Rank? Serial number?"
Shouted me. I gave them all to me.
Me agreed. 1 agreed too. "Who are
you?" Me shouted. I gave it a
moments thought.
"you" was all I could muster. "1
said take the woman and go!" I
repeated. "There's no time to
explain." I picked up the woman's
legs, and gestured him to take her
shoulders. Me looked distrustfully at
me, but he did as I suggested.
"There's only supplies for one on
the pod" me suggested.
"Don't worry about it. Make it
last, just go. There is no more time.
Go!" I said. I ushered myself into the
pod and closed the hatch behind
him, watched as the pod climbed
out of the atmosphere, and started
to wait all over again.
You'd think that experience
would change the man's decisions
over the next few days. It didn't. He
played them out just as he had
before. Wasting time, followed by a
desperate urge to preserve it.
The third day arrived again.
Fissures formed in the ground, the
sky turned red as the planet's
atmosphere intersected with vio-
lently moving plasma. Two days had
given the man time to think about
his place of hiding. A rock formation
lay about 500 meters away from the
outpost, the survey team had
explored it, and their reports sug-
gested that it might provide some
protection from the high velocity
winds and lightning that now
scourged the moon, at least until
help came. He'd set off earlier this
time, and had a chance to watch
each stage of the death of the out-
post. He gave life the best shot he
could, but like the moon, he was
doomed. He imagined Bach's
Toccata E Fugue in D minor as he
approached his confrontation with
oblivion. There was no better way to
improve his solitary death. He had-
n't given much thought to the
encounter with himself earlier, but
as death became increasingly
inevitable, that seemed like the only
apt thing to fear. Not death itself,
but what happened to him before,
and the possibility of repetition.
He stuck his head above the
rocks one last time, to see if help
had arrived. The rocks were quite as
stable as he'd hoped. Caught up in a
rolling land slide, operatic screaming
was the only thing that came to
mind.
Almost ashamed by his lack of con-
trol, the man pulled himself out of
the sludge lake that was nearby the
rock formation. He surveyed the
area, and again, the outpost had
been reborn. The pod was parked
outside again.
It had all come full circle, like
before. He ventured inside. Making
no attempt to check that the pod
was his, as he was sure it was, he
made his way to the lounge. Like
before, he stood there, as real as
himself. Both considered for a
moment. He'd chosen self sacrifice
and generosity on two previous
occasions. This time he was thinking
differently. "Go, I don't have time to
explain."
The other man, him, again
demanded explanation, identifica-
tion. Something, to confirm what his
senses told him to be true. Meeting
yourself is more than just looking in
the mirror, it's something no one
has ever experienced before, and
without a suitable reference frame,
you find it hard to discuss, even with
yourself.
Every time he tried it, it was fruit-
less, he ended up ushering himself
off the moon, with or without the
woman, more times than cared to
remember.
That was about 4 iterations
worth. More than enough for any
one man. He'd given up being a pas-
sive observer, hoping for rescue.
This time he would find out what
was happening to him, and why.
His fourth 'death' was approach-
ing. He'd run out of time, he consid-
ered ending it, by simply letting him-
self die, but that wouldn't be good
enough. He'd have to fight it out like
before. So again, he ran to the rock
to look for a hiding place. There was
no shelter, as before, just the strong
rebuttal of falling.
The fifth iteration began. Waking up
in a primordial soup was becoming
tiresome. He looked for the out-
post, and walked towards it. Once
again, he greeted himself, already
having learnt how to introduce him-
self to his antecedent self without
too much confusion.
This time though, he explained
the situation to himself, and to that
matter to his antecedent self. He
was surprisingly glad to help him-
self.
The investigation comprised of a
resume of the events which led the
man to his current predicament.
Followed by downloading of the
pod's sensor logs to the outpost's
computer.
As a scientific research station,
the outpost had been built with a
handsome array of instruments.
Some had been left behind to get a
first person perspective on the
break up of a solar system. This was
plenty, at least he hoped.
The instruments detected what
they interpreted as a series of frac-
tures across the time - space con-
tinuum. All of which, in a flight of
fancy could leave this first man
stuck in this loop. But in reality,
probably wouldn't. Man alive! They
weren't gods, he weren't gods, to be
more precise. Not even their lan-
guage had developed to be useful in
this situation.
So, what was he to do? The
antecedent man had a suggestion.
That he remain on the planet for a
few iterations, and then get another
to do the same, and so on, forever
and ever. The idea had appeal, but it
would sentence a part of the man to
eternal imprisonment on this world.
But, it was the best he, or is that
anyone, could come up with, so he
took the suggestion for all it was
worth.
That wasn't the entire plan
though. Well, only the first man
knew really what the whole idea
was. In those 5 iterations of the
loop, the man had changed, he was-
n't the same man he was only 15
days ago (if, in fact it was 15 days
ago, rather than just 15 days worth
of atomic vibrations ago?).
The first man climbed into the
pod. The woman had died of her
injuries several days ago, so there
was no need to worry about life sup-
port. He strapped himself in and
began to initialise his inertialess
drive unit. The man he once was
began to close the hatch on him. He
reached for a weapon in the cockpit
and fired at the other man's chest.
Left a neat whole through it. No
blood, it cauterized the wound
instantly. He collapsed on the land-
ing pad. The man closed the hatch
himself. That was a mercy killing, to
stop him going through the torment
he'd faced.
He fired the thrusters on the
bottom of the pod and accelerated
upwards. Of course, the man didn't
notice any of this, except the
strange feeling that he should be
feeling something as the clouds
passed by ever faster.
The pod entered a flight path
that would take it into orbit, and
from there, home. The pod planted
itself into a geostationary orbit
above the outpost, ready to make
its final orbital calculations. Getting
from planet to planet was easy, it
had been done for centuries, getting
from this moon to the mothership,
avoiding a black hole, a violently
enraged solar wind, rapidly crum-
bling asteroids and planets and a
plasma streamer was, well, a slight-
ly harder computational puzzle. The
man had little doubt however of the
flight computer's ability to perform
these small miracles.
