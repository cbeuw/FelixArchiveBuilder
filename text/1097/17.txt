ECSTASY RECONSIDERED
Nicholas Saunders * * * *
I
t's two years to the day since I
reviewed Nicholas Saunders'
Ecstasy and the Dance Culture.
Since then it has found favour in
many camps - clubbers, writers,
parents and the police. Its clear,
unpretentious and well-informed
style has led to it becoming the
ecstasy bible and there's hardly a
drug-hoover I know that doesn't
have a copy wedged between On
the Road and Dougal and the Blue
Cat on their shelf.
So what new material does
Saunders have to offer? The struc-
ture of the book is largely
unchanged, but with new sections
on risks, death and safety.
However, the most significant
addition is a greatly expanded look
at the limited scientific evidence
available. The toxicity of M D M A is
closely examined, both on a sys-
temic and neurotoxic level. The
beneficial effects of combination
with fenfluramine and fluoxetine
(Prozac) are considered.
Summaries are provided for the
non-scientific reader, and the
whole book is intensively refer-
enced - the bibliography contains
just about everything that has been
written on the subject. Saunders
has also updated the book exten-
sively, taking into account new
laws, new music and many new
personal accounts.
tary information are used exten-
sively, allowing the reader to
choose how deeply to investigate.
There are contributions from many
If I've made Ecstasy authors and an extremely wide
One of the best things about this book is that is pays for pill tests.
The results, like these, are distributed as widely as possible without
getting knee-capped.
Reconsidered sound like a text
book, don't be put off. It is beauti-
fully written with a pleasant, open
style. Boxes containing supplemen-
range of issues are dealt with, from
media attitude to illicit manufac-
ture. It is easy to read cover to
cover, and also functions well as a
reference book.
1 felt that the positive experi-
ence of taking ecstasy were under-
stated, probably to avoid being rub-
ber-stamped a pro-drugs book. The
book itself is less impressive than
the previous incarnations, with the
colour section having disappeared.
This is forgivable, though, as all
proceeds from sales of Ecstasy
Reconsidered are invested in a pill-
testing program (see picture).
Ecstasy Reconsidered is an
excellent publication and the best
source of infomation on ecstasy
availiable. Don't take drugs without
it.
