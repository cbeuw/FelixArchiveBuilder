Thought for the day
No. 4: Embarrassment
W
hat is the most embar-
rassing thing that has
ever happened to you?
Most of you will now be thinking
about that episode with the sheep
and the Physics textbook in Junior
School. Funnily enough, the most
embarrassing thing that can hap-
pen to anyone is not being tied
upside down naked to a lamp-post
in Trafalgar Square (despite what
those at Saint Mary's might think),
it is tripping over a slightly lifted
flagstone on a busy Christmas-
shopping rush Oxford Street.
Actually, no. Maybe I was right first
time.
Any readers who spend their
time theorising about the existence
or non-existence of some all-see-
ing divine entity (and, in a radical
break with tradition, we're going to
call him God), may be interested to
learn that the concept of embar-
rassment is evidence in the argu-
ment. It goes something like this: if
God did not create everything, and
indeed we did appear courtesy of
the Darwinian theory of natural
selection, then why do we feel
embarrassment? I can not really
see it serving any useful purpose in
nature. The only difference it
makes to predator and prey is that
the freshly-captured rodent blushes
slightly when he is noisily gobbled
up by the ocelot, as his drinking
mates laugh at him for not being
able to run fast enough.
No, embarrassment is another
one of God's little jokes. Did He
really rest on the seventh day?
Picture the scene; everyone is
sleeping off their Sunday lunch and
watching Jimmy White lose yet
another frame to Stephen Hendry.
Our Creator is bored. What can He
do? Well, for His own amusement,
He strolls downstairs to the lab
and, using only aliphatic hydrocar-
bons and an old bottle of Jack
Daniels that He found behind the
Persil, God formulates embarrass-
ment. (You must remember that He
had not yet thought of the Sony
Playstation.) Chalk another one up
for the believers.
So this is why the socially inept
amongst us (myself included) look
for a space between two molecules
into which to crawl when we slip
over in the street, or queue at the
wrong side of the till in a shop. This
is the reason for wanting to throw
yourself off Battersea Bridge when
your bike chain falls off just before
the lights change (just ask the
Features Editor), and this is what
makes alcohol such an amusing
substance for freshers everywhere.
Oh, dear, I'm almost out of
space. How embarrassing.
