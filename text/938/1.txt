Furse Row as Southside faces demolition
Reports on a split in College
Management over the decision to
buy Furse House have not been
denied by Mr Angus Fraser, the
College Managing Director. Furse
House is the former Ministry of
Defence hostel situated on Queen's
Gate Terrace which may be bought
as IC student accomodation. The
Rector, Sir Eric Ash, is reported to
have clashed with M r Fraser and
Director of Estates, Gordon
Marshall, over the purchase.
Sir Eric recently told (CNN that
'it would be a thousand pities' if the
hall went to another institution, and
that he would 'give an arm and a
leg' to buy the hall. The college
needs to raise Â£3 million to pay for
the hostel. This sum is regarded as
extravagantly high by both the
Finance and Estates divisions of
College, and the Directors of these
divisions are reported to believe that
the already overstretched
Residences accounts could not cope
with this additional burden. M r
Fraser told /CNN last night that 'the
effect of the purchase on the
accounts cannot be ignored.'
The dispute came to a head before
the Residences Strategy Working
Party meeting yesterday. The
meeting was due to approve a
residence report drawn up by the
Working Party which included the
budgets for the residences accounts
for 1990/1 and 1991/2. (CNN has
learned that the loss shown on the
1992 budget was to be used by the
opponents of Furse House to argue
against the purchase.
The residence report was heavily
criticised by wardens and
subwardens of several college
residences who drew up an eight
page document detailing factual
inaccuracies in the residence report.
Professor Geoff New, the chairman
of the Advisory Group of
Residences, who also sits on the
Working Party, threatened
resignation from the Working Party
if his name was not removed from
the report. Prof New refused to
comment on this allegation, but
stated that he had not been directly
involved with writing the
document. Sir Eric Ash who was
described as 'cold with fury' over
the wardens' response, used these
inaccuracies to cancel the
publication of the residence report,
and it was not discussed by the
meeting.
The news of the Rector's decision
was broken to the Working Party by
Angus Fraser. It is believed that the
Rector briefed Mr Fraser in a
meeting on Tuesday afternoon, but
the decision to effectively stop the
report came as a surprise to most
of those present at the meeting
yesterday (Thursday). M r Marshall
was reported to have been
'flabbergasted' and afterwards was
overheard to remark that Mr Fraser
had not briefed him on the Rector's
decision.
Speaking to (CNN, M r Fraser
said that some comments had been
made at the meeting about the
report. 'There were some
questions, mainly about the
presentation of the report and the
strategic aims of the report,' he
said, adding that following the
Rector's intervention, the figures in
the appendices to the report were
being 'revised'. 'The report will
then be issued to the original
distribution,' he said.
Mr Fraser said that the report
'will be worked on between now
and the autumn.' Opponents of the
purchase of Furse House are
outraged at this timescale. They
point to sealed bids having to be
entered for the property by 8th July,
and say it is no accident that the
report has been deferred until so
long after the Furse House decision
has been made. M r Fraser refused
to deny that he had difference of
opinion with the Rector over the
purchase. 'We are clear on the
programme on which we are
working,' he added.
The purchase of Furse House is
of strategic importance in what is
understood to be a plan to demolish
the Southside Halls of Residence.
(CNN has learned of a discussion
document which suggests the
replacement of Southside with a
conference centre. We understand
that the Southside Halls were given
a twenty five year lifetime when
they were built over twenty seven
years ago. There are currently
reports that the foundations of the
halls are beginning to crumble,
though no-one from Estates was
available for comment on the story
yesterday.
The suggestion was fuelled
earlier this week when it was
announced that Simon Westerman,
College Catering Manager, had
proposed the closure of the Gardens
Restaurant, and the moving of
Southside Bar and Belushis to the
Sherfield building. (CNN has since
been informed by reliable sources
that the proposal has been discussed
at the highest levels of the Estates
division, and that a written record
of this discussion exists. College
Managing Director, Angus Fraser,
denounced the reports as 'totally
unfounded'. He added that there
were 'no plans for the demolition
or replacement of Southside.
Southside is a student residence and
will always remain one.'
