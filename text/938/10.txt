Union Felix 938 12 June 1992
If you have an accident or fall ill
in your home country you should
know where to go for help and what
to expect. Would you be as well
prepared elsewhere in Europe or the
world though? Do you know if you
can get free hospital treatment while
on holiday in Greece? What would
your rights be if you had an accident
in Guyana?
Travelling within the European
Community
The U K has reciprocal healthcare
arrangements with the 11 other E C
countries. This means that you will
be entitled to treatment under a
particular country's state healthcare
scheme if you fall ill or have an
accident there.
in the U K should obtain their E l 11
from the Overseas Branch of the
Department of Social Security. The
address can be found on page 19 of
booklet T2.
If you need treatment in another
EC country, follow the instructions
given in the booklet as procedures
vary from country to country.
Failure to do this could result in you
being charged private fees and you
may not be able to get a refund. In
most E C countries emergency
treatment in hospital or from a
doctor is normally free with an
E l 11. There are exceptions though.
In France, for example, you have
to pay a percentage of the cost of
treatment yourself; in Greece you
Protecting your Holiday Health
Travelling outside the European
Community
Travellers intending to go further
afield will probably need to plan
further in advance than would be
necessary for trips within the E C .
Information on emergency
treatment, vaccinations, diseases
and insurance recommendations can
all be found in booklet Tl—Health
Advice for Travellers Outside the
European Community (also
available from the Welfare Office
or Union Foyer). The booklet
contains advice on precautions you
should take before travelling and
information on how to deal with
emergencies once you are abroad.
You should make sure that you have
adequate insurance to cover all
eventualities and should seek to
consult your doctor at least two
months before travelling if any
vaccinations are likely to be
required. Details are contained
within booklet T l , so read it now
and don't wait for an emergency!
Stefano Ruis,
ICU Welfare
Adviser, on the
dangers of
going abroad.
In order to receive emergency
medical treatment in an EC country
with the minimum of fuss you will
need form E l 11. Anyone who is
ordinarily resident in this country
and is either a U K / E C citizen or a
stateless person/refugee is eligible
for form E l 11, confirming their
entitlement to free (or reduced cost)
emergency medical treatment in the
Community. To obtain your E l 11
complete the form at the back of
booklet T2—Health Advice for
Travellers inside the European
Community (available from the
Welfare Office or Union foyer) and
take it to any Post Office for
validation. The form lasts
idefinitely provided that you remain
ordinarily resident in the U K .
Students who are nationals of
another EC country but are resident
may have to pay for things like X -
rays and lab tests. In some countries
you are required to pay for
treatment at the time and then claim
back the money later. Full details
can be found in the T2 booklet.
Although form E l 11 can save
money and hassle in emergencies it
is no substitute for proper travel
insurance. An E l 11 won't cover
private treatment nor will it meet
the cost of repatriation in the event
of a serious accident or illness.
Good travel insurance will normally
extend to such eventualities—but
read the small print! Generally
speaking, it will normally be
worthwhile paying for a suitable
policy so shop around and make
sure yor requirements are met
adequately.
Before you travel anywhere in the
world, follow the health care advice
given in the booklets, especially the
sections on vaccinations and
HIV/AIDS. Your GP should be
able to answer any specific queries
on particular healthcare matters.
