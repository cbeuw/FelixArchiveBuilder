'Stop theft' call Medical poll
Students have again been asked to
guard their belongings while in
College buildings. The advice
follows three mysterious cardigan
thefts earlier this week. The
garments were contained in separate
bags stolen from outside the Maths
department library on Tuesday
afternoon. The bags also contained
cheque books, cheque cards and
College security cards. The Maths
department, unlike Chemical
Engineering and Chemistry, does
not provide lockers for students
using the departmental library.
College Deputy Security chief,
Terry Briley, told / C N N that
students who lose their swipe cards
should contact Sherfield Security
immediately on extension 3372.
The thefts come after two
incidents on Friday night. The Fire
Brigade arrived at Beit Quad just
after midnight in answer to a hoax
call. The call is believed to have
been made from the telephone box
beside the Royal College of Music
(RCM), and the hoaxer is reported
to be a student of the R C M who was
evicted from the Quad by duty
officers earlier in the evening.
The second incident occurred in
the Prince's Gardens area, when a
beer glass was thrown from the roof
of Southside Bar to the pavement
below. The assailant is believed to
have thrown the glass from between
staircase 3 and 4, on the third level
of Tizard Hall. This follows an
attack two weeks ago, when a
police van was damaged by a glass
thrown from the same area. The
police had been called to investigate
a fictitious fight outside Southside
Bar. Police are reported to be
interested in enforcing the Southside
Bar licensing laws following the
incident. (/CNN).
CVCP cash plea
The Committee of Vice Chancellors
and Principals (CVCP) has asked
the government for an extra £450
million. The C V C P , which
represents the heads of all U K
universities, stated that £165 million
was needed to improve pay of
existing academic staff and another
£39 million would be needed for
new staff to teach increased student
numbers.
The report also stated that over
£95 million would be needed in
each of the next three years to bring
university buildings up to a safe
standard. The committee also
recommended that hardship funds
Council elections
should be increased by 10% above
inflation per annum.
The move is in the light of
polytechnics being granted
university status. Polytechnics can
now apply direct to the University
Funding Council (UFC) and will be
in direct competition for funding
with universities. The polytechnics
would be very capable of competing
on equal terms with the established
universities as their annual intake is
twice that of universities.
Polytechnics currently teach more
than half of higher education
students. (Independent)
A meeting of the Joint Imperial
College Union Council will be held
in the Union Dining Hall on
Thursday 25 June at 2.00pm.
Candidates eligible for election to
the College Committees have been
notified that applications must be
returned by Thursday 18 June. The
elections are for posts in the College
Committees on Departmental
Computing, Radiation Safety,
Undergraduate Studies, Wine,
Humanities, Safety Council and Bar
and Catering. The post of Council
chairman will also be filled at this
meeting. (/CNN).
Supercollege
The Government has granted
permission for the foundation of a
'Super-College' in Sheffield. The
new college, which will cater for
44,000 students, will be created by
a merger of six of the city's further
education colleges. The
amalgamation of the existing
colleges should be finished by April
1993.
The new college will teach
academic and vocational courses to
almost all of the city's sixth-form
students, as well as providing a
large number of adult education
courses. It will be the second largest
educational establishment in
Britain, with the University of
London, including Imperial,
remaining the largest.
It is reported that the decision was
taken to stop potential competition
between colleges once they became
responsible for their own finances.
It is thought that the larger
institution will be able to obtain
funding more easily from a new
further education funding council.

The operation of the Patient's
Charter is to be smoothed by a new
survey launched at St Mary's
Hospital Medical School. The
nationwide inquiry is to examine the
quality of care in hospitals from a
patients perspective by asking what
they think of their treatment. A
questionnaire will be sent to five
thousand patients in 36 randomly
selected hospitals, and the results
are expected to help hospital staff
meet charter standards.
The survey is being funded by a
15 month grant worth £284,548
from the Board of Directors of The
Commonwealth Fund. North East
Thames, North West Thames,
Oxford and Yorkshire Regional
Health Authorities are funding the
cost of surveying additional
hospitals within their areas.

Lecturer pay hit
Imperial College lecturers are
facing the prospect that their future
pay rises will be linked to their
teaching abilities in lectures and
seminars. The possibility of
performance related pay has
increased following a letter from the
Department for Education to
lecturers' employers. The letter
suggests that education ministers
are urging the introduction of civil
service style pay checks, where
individual performance is ranked
annually on a one to five scale, and
awarded consequentially in the pay
packet.
The letter emulates the ideals
expressed in the Citizens' Charter,
launched by the Prime Minister in
July 1991. At the Charter launch,
pay review bodies were exhorted to
take more account of performance
when assessing pay claims in the
public sector. At the time, this
measure was implicitly targeted at
British Rail and London
Underground employees.
Performance related pay was one of
the constituent elements in the
proposed Students' Charter. The
idea was originally floated in
Downing Street last January, and
will be discussed again on June 19.
The plan had the support of the then
Education Secretary, Kenneth
Clarke, and this enthusiasm is
shared by the current Education
Secretary, John Patten.
The letter follows work by senior
academics which questions the
entire thinking behind performance
related pay. Derek Torrington, of
the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and
Technology, has alleged that there
is no evidence to suggest that
relating pay for academics to
performance in teaching or
lecturing would lead to higher
standards in either. He suggests that
performance related pay tends to
demotivate the majority of the
workforce. 'An examination of
schemes running in eight large
organisations suggests that
performance-related pay seldom
achieves what its advocates claim
and can present considerable
problems,' writes Mr Torrington.
Staff appraisal currently exists in
the university sector, having been
introduced in 1987. At the time of
introduction, an undertaking was
given that appraisal was not to be
linked with promotion or
disciplinary matters. Appraisal is
only used in deciding the pay
awards to polytechnic heads of
departments and senior staff. The
letter from education ministers is
the first formal connection between
appraisal and university pay levels.
This new connection is set against
the background of continual
disruption in the university pay
negotiating system. The 1991/2
university pay round has not yet
been approved by the Government,
with the Association of University
Teachers ( A U T ) delaying
performance related salaries by
having the matter referred to a
working party.
The A U T has not reacted
'authoritively' to the performance
pay letter, as it 'was not addressed
to the A U T . ' Speaking to / C N N ,
the A U T stressed that the 1991/2
pay agreement negotiated with
employers 'already takes full
account of the Government's
declared interest as detailed in the
Citizen's Charter.' They added that
the A U T 'policy making council has
for some time spoken its clear
opposition to discretionary pay,'
though Government ministers are
reported as believing that the deal
does not go far enough. In
particular, they have singled out the
figures of an across the board rise
of 6%, compared with a
discretionary element of only 1 %.
The Education Department letter,
which has been described as having
the Treasury's finger marks 'all
over it', firmly states that it is trying
to introduce performance related
pay 'within the context of a pay
offer no greater than it otherwise
may have been.' This suggests that
lecturers may be facing a pay cut
if they do not pass appraisal tests.
