Love & A Bottle Grave
London, 1700, a little known Irish
playwright is trying to survive in a
world seemingly populated by
scatterbrained fops and their
matching empty headed women.
The critics hate him, he owes his
landlady umpteen weeks back rent
(to be payed in sexual favours if he
can't scrape the money together).
George Lyric is on the way down.
Being a man of some dignity he
decides to bring as much of the
world crashing down with him. He
starts to write a play featuring the
fops of the day (as every other play
written by his contemporaries). The
fat pigeons strut their stuff on the
stage, while the playwright
introduces one final character; a fox
known as George Roebuck, a man
with as few morals as the fops, but
lacking their 'all for one' principles
of comradeship and camaraderie. In
other words a dangerous man.
Roebuck, having left two lovers
and a bastard son in Ireland, comes
to London to escape his
'attachments'. Unfortunately, all
three follow him to the Capital. The
result is a comic and often black
farce involving not only the lovers
but their relations, all of which get
embroiled in the complex plot of
lies and seduction. George Lyric,
Falstaff
the playwright appears on stage
from time to time, to moderate his
characters, but fails to keeps
Roebuck under his control.
Written by George Farquhar and
adapted by Declan Hughes, this is
one of best farces I have ever seen.
It manages to retain a serious thread
throughout its length, and Rough
Magic (the theatre company)
manages to change smoothly from
shallow comedy to serious drama.
An excellent performance by
Phelim Drew as George Roebuck.

• Love and a Bottle is showing at
the Tricycle Theatre, Kilburn High
Road. It is running until the 27th
June and tickets can be bought from
the box office on 071 328 1000.
The play is about a family dealing
with the loss of one of its members.
The deceased father figure is a
vicar, and so the subject of the play '
is supposed to be the collapse and
regeneration of faith...
Unfortunately a play needs much
more than a dead vicar in order to
attempt an intricate subject such as
human faith. The scenes are too
numerous and short to develop any
meaningful point. All the usual
psycholgical profiles were present:
the son, suffering from acute
Oedipus complex, the mother,
rediscovering sex, the rebellious
daughter...All too typical!
Fortunately Mary Peates, the
director of the play, manages to
make full use of the potential
present in actors such as Ben
Robertson, thus enhancing the few
positive points in the text. These
usually consist of humorous
dialogues about the marital status of
the different characters or
monologues about the church.
If you're going to see a play this
week, see one of the others on this

• Playing until 20th June at the
Finborough Theatre Club (above
the pub), 8pm, Monday to
Saturday. Tickets are £6 to £4 from
the Box Office (071-373 3842)
At the heart of Verdi's Falstaff, the
fat, philandering knight of the title,
having failed in a seduction attempt,
is flung into the Thames in a basket
of dirty laundry. In ENO's revival
of Verdi's final opera, Benjamin
Luxon's portrayal of Falstaff's
transformation from overweening
pomposity to abject, wheezing
panic, and a coup de theatre from
producer David Pountney unlock
the full comic potential of this
famous scene. At other points
during the evening, however, the
production is slightly less successful
at tapping the vein of hilarity that
runs through the work.
Musically, all is well and much
is first rate. Luxon's Falstaff is
well- rounded in every sense, his
ample tone matching his girth, his
acting capturing the larger than life
exuberance and appetite his role
requires. Outstanding amongst the
four ladies are Susan Bullock as
Mistress Ford, for her beautiful
tone and clear diction, and Alison
Hagley's sparkling Nanetta.
Bonaventura Bottone, as the latter's
lover Fenton, though vocally secure
and pleasing, is rather less
characterful.
In the pit, Mark Elder gives a
detailed, well-balanced reading of
Verdi's orchestral score; the singers
are never overwhelmed and subtle
masterstrokes such as the doubling
of piccolo and cellos in the first
scene are tellingly realised.
