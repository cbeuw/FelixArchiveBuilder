Straight Talk Johnny Suede
There is nothing special about this
film apart from the fact that it stars
Dolly Parton and James Woods. If
you are ardent fans of either of them
you may just about appreciate what
it has to offer.
It's supposed to be a musical
comedy, but it's nowhere near;
poor screenplay, poor direction,
poor me for having to sit through
the film. Holy Moley.
I think the film is trying to wing
it on Miss Parton's popularities^)
as well as using it as a vehicle to
restore her acting credibility. James
Wood's talent on the other hand is
completely wasted.
I suppose I should give a brief
outline of the story, though it has
been done before and seen before
this rags to riches saga.
Well, there is a small-town dance
instructor Shirlee Kenyon (Dolly
Parton) who becomes rich and
famous when she lands a job as a
radio talk-in therapist. She dishes
out her honest, home-spun
philosophies to those who need it:-
a true 'doctor of the heart'. Enter
Jack Russell (James Woods) a hard-
headed news reporter. He befriends
Shirlee as an attempt to expose the
fact that she is not the college
educated doctor her image portrays
her to be. With a little imagination
you can figure out the rest.
A happy ever after story,
gushing, but thankfully not overly
sentimental. To end with I must
pass on some advice many poor
I.C. souls will cherish, 'It's your
life, so you've gotta honk your own
horn.' Honk away...

The Lawnmower Man
This is mainly a display of Virtual
Reality - a computer generated
universe where man is limited only
by his imagination. There is a plot,
very loosely based on a Steven King
short story, to tie the special effects
together. Pierce Brosman plays Dr
Angelo, a peaceloving virtual
reality specialist who works for the
sinister 'shop'. He is encouraged to
take a hiatus after his most
advanced chimpanzee goes
rampaging though the corridors of
the shop, it's aggression level raised
to such a point by virtual reality that
it has to be killed by a security
guard.
Upset by the violence in the
world around him and left by his
girlfriend, Dr Angelo takes the
simple Joab, his Lawnmower Man,
into his tutorage. The use of drugs
and a peaceful version of V R
produces a highly intelligent, if very
innocent, man. So far everything
has gone to plan for Dr Angelo until
The Shop get interested again and
supplant the aggression back into
Joab.
This is where Dr Angelo's dream
of a superior peaceful human race
falls to pieces and Joab's decision
of his own destiny toTule the world
as a benevolent dictator take over.
Johnny Suede is another film which
opens this Friday. I saw this movie
last term so my recollection of it is
not terribly good. Anyhow, I'll try
my best.
Compared to Straight Talk it is
not your usual American
commercial movie. It is more on the
lines of an off-beat Jim Jarmusch
film. Written and directed by Tom
DiCillio, starring Brad Pitt of the
Levi's advert where he walks out
of jail in his boxer shorts.
A darkly comic fable, packed
with the symbolism of objects and
dreams. Set in the shadows of a
modern American metropolis- it
looked more like a deserted area of
ruined tenement buildings.
Johnny Suede (Brad Pitt) is a
poor, naive and not quite a musician
with a 12 inch hair-style. Johnny
meets and falls in love with Darlette
(Alison Moir). Their relationship
doesn't last as she is involved with
an older,quirky man. As he tries to
keep his band together, Johnny
meets Yvonne (Catherine Keener).
Yvonne is warm, caring and
generous-the complete opposite to
Darlette. An uneasy relationship
develops between them which
begins to threaten Johnny's illusions
of himself.
The characters are well written,
though the pace of the movie is
slow. At times it was strange when
dream sequences are used to
express Johnny's intuitive response
to the changes in his life. But they
proved to be rather interesting. On
the whole it is well directed and
suitably acted.

• Opens today at the Chelsea
Cinema and around London.
Jeff Fahey's performance as the
simpleton turned genius is engaging
and Pierce Brosman's scientist
looks very harassed but very
unconvincing in the intimate scenes.
The film itself does not raise many
questions for us to mull over as we
leave the cinema since the effects
are all that hold it together.
