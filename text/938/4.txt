Eat
-Old Trout
Jessica Rabbit is surveying the Old
Trout from on top of a speaker
stack. Her feminine eye is
supervising Eat's every move, and
her head is touching the ceiling. Not
that Eat actually make that many
moves that need supervising. It
takes Ange (the lead singer, a he,
find out why he's called Ange next
week) three songs to introduce the
band. 'Hello, we're Eat.' Oh, now
there's a surprise. He follows this
extravagnza of crowd interaction
with 'Bellytown', the first really
good song of the night.
After this, he becomes more
involved, baiting the audience with
Rick Astley jibes, prowling a round
the stage in a game of one man
peek-a-boo, and leading the band
through the set, highlights being
'First Time Love Song', 'Fatman'
and the obligatory 'Golden Egg'.
Eat are a feverish experience and
well worth catching.

• £af play at the Town & Country
Club tomorrow night. The single
'Golden Egg' is out now on
Fiction/Polydor.
Cud, Sensitize
-Underworld
The first half of Sensitize's set is
rather samey and monotonous, with
one song being virtually
indistinguishable from another, and
only 'Try' standing out. But then,
about half way through, they get
their act in order, and with their last
four songs, 'Untitled', 'Falling
Through', 'Beautiful Home' and
'Watertight', they introduce
variety, life, and humour (with their
closing comment, 'If you want to
abuse us, abuse us. That's what
we're here for.'). If only they could
keep this up throughout the set.
First on the stage is Steve, the
drummer from Cud, music press
figure of ridicule, closely followed
by the rest of the band. Lead singer
Carl gets cries of 'fat bastard' which
he quells most succinctly. Last time
I saw Cud, in December 1990,
Cud missile.
positioned as they were in a Ned's-
Stuffies sandwich, they sucked it
big time. Now on major label, they
are almost transformed. But any of
their songs could break into 'Rich
And Strange', their well-deserved
chart hit. Is it just a characteristic
sound, or do all their songs sound
exactly alike?
And after that song, when the
ephemeral fans have drifted off,
towards the end of the set, I feel an
unwilling smile creep across my
face. Carl Puttnam has control of
my face muscles and I want it. He
also has the world's worst line in
anecdotes, which generally consist
of forfilling his submarine fetish.
After this, a hint of variety creeps
into their set too, closing with the
serene 'Love In A Hollow Tree',
which itself concludes with a drum
solo. First up, last to go.

OCud's 'Rich And Strange' is out
now on A & M .
Silverfish
-Organ Fan
Don't be misled by photos in the
inkies. Leslie F. Rankine is not a
happy smiling girl, harmless and
flowery. No. No. No. The nearest
this fearsome celt gets to flowers is
the fourth song on this album,
'Petal', and that is, if I'm not
mistaken, and I probably am, about
oral sex. Sod that, most of the first
side is about that particular radio-
friendly subject.
So, assuming you keep this album
away from grandmothers, Radio 1
DJs and other sensitive types, and
Del Amitri
you never meet Lesley Silverfish in
a 'Silverfish are crap' t-shirt, what
can you expect to hear on this
album? A solid wall of noise,
chunks of guitar from Mr Fuzz,
(not, I am assured, the M r Fuzz of
PWEI), 'Piqsqueal' from 'Fuckin'
Drink or What?' ep, a cover of
David Essex's 'Rock On'. (David
Essex!), the rather excellent 'Joos'
(as in orange) and, if you're quick,
a free 7" single with live version of
'TFA'.
So what are you waiting for? Oh
right. Monday.

• 'Organ Fan' is out on Monday.
Silverfish play at the Astoria next
Friday.
-Change Everything
Justin Currie is clearly a soul in
torment. But torment brings forth
the artist, as this masterful
collection of ballads and catchy
guitar bits shows. There's none of
that 'beloved misty glen' syndrome
a la Runrig nor even a mention of
'wee dram' or a 'bleak city' (i.e.
Glasgow), all of which seem to be
becoming consistent themes of
Scottish bands these days.
Del Amitri are rising to the
Jerry Burns
-Jerry Burns
stature of Deacon Blue, in that
every track has the potential of
charting successfully. Currie's
voice shines through 'Always the
Last to Know' and 'Just Like a
Man'. It's bound to go straight to
the top of the Scottish album charts
from sales to their substantial Celtic
following, but might just scrape the
top ten here for a couple of weeks.
Indeed a worthy successor to
'Waking Hours'.
Stormingly fantabulous.
MacWomble.
Nice to see you've dumped Mick,
you silly Texan; now that's what I
call a chocolate bar. 'A last request,
Gringo' 'Huh, jus' lemme che-ew
on this Texan Bar here'. Then the
emaciated skeletons of the Mexican
Militia would succumb to the ale,
the sun or the pox, leaving our
erstwhile condemned beefcake free
to slowly wander, slowly chewing.
Burns? I should say so, the rate
you're moving at. Whither speed?
beauty?
It's attractive, sweetly-voiced,
stuff. So sweet, in fact, it's
suppurating. Buy it. Buy an ounce
of tobacco. Buy the tarry discharge
and set it in your lungs. Buy
Emphysema. Despair all you like so
long as something positive comes
out of it; aren't I just the surliest?
Give me more ssss... Groove, you
bitch, do something, hit. It
promises, hints at, alludes to, leaves
before it delivers; One wonders,
'If?', Like everything else. Love it
for that.
Angalas.
• Out now on Columbia.
