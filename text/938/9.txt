12 June 1992 Felix 938 Clubs & Societies
A group of nine students and former
students of Imperial College will,
this summer, be embarking on a
unique adventure to the Pamir
mountains of Tadzhikistan. All
members are part of IC Scout and
Guide Club and have spent the past
seven months carefully planning the
expedition. The area they will be
visiting lies at the northern end of
the Himalayas in one of the
republics of the former Soviet
Union. This area has recently hit
headline news in this country as
mass demonstrations over
communist rule led to violence in
the country's capital, Dushanbe.
This has since calmed down after
the government allowed Muslims to
take up ministerial posts, and the
general feeling in the country is one
of general relief. There is also a
feeling of general relief amongst the
expedition!
The Imperial College Pamir
Expedition 1992 will be one of the
first to explore the southern end of
the mountains due to the pervious
barriers of Soviet Bureaucracy and
the Afghan war, and this has also
meant that few Soviet climbers have
also reached the region. One of the
few other expeditions that have
reached the Pamirs was that led by
the expedition patron, Lord Hunt
(who led the 1953 Everest
Expedition) in 1962. These
expeditions, however, travelled
with the authorities to huge
international camps where most of
the peaks are regularly ascended.
The Imperial College expedition, on
the other hand, will be travelling
independently to a much more
remote area, having built relations
with Russian mountaineers and
Tadzhik scientsts with whom they
will be working with in the
moutnains. These contacts have
already proved very useful since
they have been sent maps of the
area—none of which existed before
in Britain since they were illegal to
posess before the break-up of the
Soviet Union, and are still very hard
to obtain.
To reach the area entails two air
flights, followed by a truck drive on
dirt-tracks for 150 miles, and then
travel on foot and with local animals
to reach base camp. Since this will
The non-climbers will be heading
the scientific projects, which will be
carried out by all the members (all
are scientists and engineers) and
helped by scientists in Tadzhikistan.

take much time, the expedition is
arranging for a Soviet helicopter to
pick them up from base camp for
the return journey. From base camp
the climbers will set up several
advance base camps from where
they hope to make the first British
ascents of peaks up to 21,000ft
(Mont Blanc is a mere 15,770ft),
and to explore the area for future
expeditions. The information and
photographs that they will bring
back will be of great value to the
Royal Geographical Society, British
Mountaineering Council and Mount
Everest Foundation, all of whom
support the expedition and are keen
for it to go ahead.

area at all, and so the findings will
be of great importance. Collections
will be made from mobile scientific
camps that will be placed over a
range of altitudes and habitats. The
scientific projects have attracted the
attention of David Bellamy, who
has agreed to become the
expedition's other patron. The
material will be identified and
analysed upon return by the
museum and in Germany, and used
in studies on ozone depletion and
global warming at high altitude.
Over the past few months the
expedition has been raising funds
and obtaining help with food
supplies and equipment. All their
food must travel with them and they
must purchase the necessary
clothing and equipment for survival
in the harsh environment. Great
financial help and advice has been
given by the Exploration Board and
the University of London, with
smaller, but equally important,
dontations from a number of other
organisations. The expedition has
been helped by Unique Tours of
Piccadilly and there has been a
tremendous response to our
equipment appeal—Kofiach Boots,
Phoenix, Casio watches, Duracell
batteries, Ambre Solaire, Horlicks
and Ovaltine and are all but a few.
All that remains now is to pick up
and pack the supples, then hit the
road to Heathrow.
