Letters Felix 938 12 June 1992
Fiscal Probity Mickey Mouse
Dear Adam,
I cannot accept any claims of
financial irresponsibility. We have
a large team of financial advisers
retained, Barlow-Clowes, Keith
Best, the Maxwell Brothers, Alex
Lodge to name but a few. Rectitude
and Fiscal Probity is the name of the
game for us.
Imagine my surprise on 3 June
1992 when Felix or rather ICU
Print Unit sent me two bills for
work done. One of them had
nothing to do with us, the other
included work already paid for.
Between us paying and the new bill
arriving the prices for the work
carried out had changed. Bizarre!
Surely financial incompetence if
ever I say it.
Guilds President, Tim Proctor,
was so shocked by this
incompetence, that he has
experienced some hair loss. Sources
close to him say he is considering
sueing for damages.

Dear Adam,
May I draw your attention to your
editorial in Felix 923 (24 January
1992), where regarding the letters
column you laid down your
editorial policy:
'.. .although I do allow names to
be withheld on occasion, this only
occurs if the letter's author
persuades me in person that they
would be in danger from retailiation
if their authorship was known.
Mere embarrassment is not
enough—don't be a coward—stand
up for your views.'
I can only assume that this policy
has been changed viewing the
anonymous letter in this week's
Felix (937, 5 June 1992)
commenting on the City & Guilds
article in the issue (Felix 936, 29
May 1992). It is unclear what
retribution the author could fear as
the executive committee of City &
Guilds is more than open to
constructive comment—perhaps
you now feel that in some cases
cowardice is a justifiable reason for
protecting someone's identity.
Yours sincerely,
Tim Proctor, President,
City & Guilds College Union.
I Congratulate Mr Proctor at
being able to read. Am I correct
in assuming that he had no
complaint about the witholding of
authorship until the one letter
which referred to his parish? He
On a more serious note we all
appreciate the credit service run by
Felix for their photocopier, but if
it's too difficult to do—then don't
do it.
C Tomkins (with tongue firmly
in cheek), Guilds HIT.
You'll be glad to hear that we are
getting a card system for the
photocopier very soon. The
details have not yet been sorted -
but it will be advertised in Felix.

knows who wrote that letter
because the individual told him.
I really don't see the problem.
Perhaps he found it difficult to
fault any comment in that letter
so he decided to attack its author
or myself. I'm afraid that's not
very convincing.
The comment in the editorial
was a statement of intent - what
should happen rather than what
does. I have to bend to the wishes
of my correspondents. But I am
unclear as to why he bothered to
write the above letter. It wouldn't
be because of a deep dislike of me,
would it? Surely the President of
the City and Guilds Union would
not risk dragging the entire
organisation through the mud
because of an infantile tendency
to protect his non-existent
integrity? That really would be
stupid. Such a President would be
rightly considered as a blethering
airhead who has done more
damage to his Union in the few
hours a week he spends with it
than a College Newspaper editor
ever could. Fortunately, this is all
conjecture, as I am far too
responsible to do that - I have to
put up with the comeback in.,
ooh.. one more Felix this year, I
think. I can match Mr Proctor in
snideness anytime. I have had
much more experience.

Dear Adam,
Regarding your report on the
Sports Centre Felix 937: When the
plans for the Sports Centre changes
were first mooted, 'the
management' claimed that by not
going ahead with the plans they
were losing x thousands of pounds,
where x was a large number that
was considerably more than the
shortfall between income and
expenditure of the Sports Centre.
When I queried this with Valerie
Straw (facilities manager) I was told
one had to consider the losses in
terms of opportunity costs. That is,
although the Sports Centre had a
shortfall of about £40,000, because
(so College management claimed)
it could make say, £100,000 profit,
it was actually losing £140,000!
I would like to apply this
principle to the loan ICU is making
to IC for the Sports Centre. If the
money were invested, according to
my accountant a return of
14%—20% per annum would be
expected, depending on whether the
investment is at home or abroad and
amount of risk. Assume that the U K
achieves its target of 4% inflation,
then £650,000 compounded over 12
years would be worth roughly
between £2 million to £3.6 million
at today's rates. The Felix article
does not make it clear how College
intend to repay the loan. Assuming
it is repaid in equal instalments of
£ 5 4 , 0 0 0 and each year I C U
invested the returned money on the
aforementioned terms, after 12
years ICU would have between
£1.1 million to £1.6 million. Some
may consider my assumptions a
little optimistic, however they are
far more credible than the Mickey
Mouse business plans put forward
for the Sports Centre.
So what does ICU get for its

I'm writing a booklet on
accommodation and would
like to talk to you about your

money? You attribute our president
as claiming that the money will
provide better sports facilities.
Where are these then? The additions
are a Jaccuzzi, steam room and
sauna. Hardly sports facilities.
Attract better students? This will be
secondary, since the prime
motivation for the aforementioned
facilities is to attract 'middle aged
executives' (quote attributed to
Gordon Marshall in an earlier
Felix).
Your article also claims the
changes have been agreed with the
widest possible consultation. Who
was consulted? When the plans for
the changes were orginally put to
the College Athletics Committee
those present got the impression
from Valerie Straw that student
views had been sought and that they
were keen on the changes. In fact
they did not even know about them
(a remarkably similar scenario to
that on the front page of Felix 937
regarding car-park privatisation-
unions, which also has the
commonality of flexible financial
information that can ebb and flow
to suit the argument of the day, but
is never available for scrutiny).
Further, one should bear in mind
that 'consult' does not exclude
'ignore.' For anyone who thinks
that 'the management' would not be
so dastardly, consider this year's
pricing scheme for the Sports
Centre and the debate, but not
change, it caused. And of course
even higher fees are ont he way.
The current management practice is
that proposals are first approved by
management and then the
consultation takes place. The fear
that this 'consultation' is more akin
to imposition was voiced at the
Academic Staff Assembly last year.
It was also claimed that the
changes are in the best interests of
students now and in the future.
Difficult to justify since current
students will not have a Sports
Centre for five and a half months,
as for future students, £1 million or
an old bubble bath? It is a tough
choice, but, I think I will go for...
Two more little questions: Why
was it that the redevelopment was
supposed to be done over summer
vacation—which is only three
months, and now is going to take
over five? And why has the
budget—provisionally of £350,000
(Note to M P G 1991) shot up to over
£650,000, even though the works
are less extensive than originally
planned?
