Pop Will Eat Itself,
Scorpio Rising
-Marquee
About a year ago I would rather
have gone on a Croatian weekender
than go and see Scorpio Rising play
live again. Come to think of it, for
a while this evening sitting on the
Marquee staircase while they
played also seemed like a better
proposition. However, it came to be
that I was led (some would say
deceived) into standing slap bang at
the front middle of the stage when
Scorpio Rising appeared. The point
is, and you don't know how much
it pains me to say this, but Scorpio
Rising were...erm...good. Very
good actually. However, in my
defence they were erm...too loud
and too erm...funny or something.
Don't you hate it when that
happens? You're just dying to slag
something off and then they go and
be good...gits.
Pop Will Eat Himself (as my
mother insists on telling her friends
they are called) are incredible this
evening. Right from their
merchandise prices to their encores
they really are something out of the
ordinary. They whip up such a
frenzy in here tonight that they
actually induced the much fabled
gas chamber effect. You know the
one, it's where everything goes
blurry and you pass out and get
trampled on then wake up in the
Arising, the one eyed messioh of Scorpio.
middle of a well wicked stage
dive...that sort of thing. I was
however later informed by a friend
that these feelings of chronic
exhileration and exhaustion
followed by acute asphixiation may
have been a result of too much fizzy
lager, constant manic dancing and
bugger all ventilation. While all
arguments are, I admit, perfectly
reasonable, I still blame my own
near death experience on the band
themselves. When I saw them at
Reading last year they easily stole
the show from the other so-called
headliners. Somehow though, the
threat of new material made a repeat
performance seem a little unlikely.
Oops! Big mistake! Major
misconception. Pop Will Eat Itself
are still the dogs bollocks when it
comes to playing live. Sixteen
different flavours of heaven and
every one better than a Haagen Das,
yessir! Catch them if you can.

Sensitize
-Falling
Through
Three tracks: In reverse order.
'Rely' is, and there is no discussion
involved, The Wonder Stuff's
'Give, Give, Give me More, More,
More', 'Teenage Kicks' is, and
should remain, by the Undertones
and 'Falling Through' is justifiably
the lead track, comparatively
bearable, and quite catchy.
