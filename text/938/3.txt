12 June 1992 Felix 938 Editorial
Union Business editorial
The A G M may seem a long way
away, if you consider a week and
a half to be a long time. Some
meetings are actually worth
attending and this is one of them.
What exactly have the sabbaticals
been doing over the last year?
You may find that a difficult
questions to answer but then again,
so may the sabbaticals. The A G M
exists to provide this information to
the students along with the answers
to many more varied questions.
There are also elections for the
Union posts of: Haldane Record
and Book Buyer, House Committee
ordinary members, Felix Business
Manager, Post-Graduate Affairs
A gentle game of croquet on the
lawn, sipping pimms and feasting
on strawberries, unwinding to the
strains of Richard Strauss
Serenades—what could possibly be
a better way to celebrate the end of
a hectic term. Midsummer '92 is
on Friday 26 June 1992.
So here's the events for
everyone—stylish and elegant, but
with a sense of carnival!!
6.00—Sip Pimms, spritzer, punch
or beer from one of our special
bars. Croquet—play with style!

Serenades—the IC orchestra

of their facilities (namely the bar).
We now have a reciprocal
agreement with the above

their bar they will require a 'bar
card' available from the Polytechnic

(before 5.30pm, any weekday) and
a passport photograph as required.
Enjoy the rest of term,

The ways of the media are strange
Who would have beleived that a
quarter page box in Felix asking for
people to collect their artwork - you
may remember 'Ye Olde Felix
Jumble Sale' - could be newsworthy
enough to reach the pages of the
29th of May issue of the Times
Higher Education Supplement.
There it was again, rewritten as a
slightly humorous account,

Scones
presumably giving insight into the
machinations of a student
newspaper. Of all the possible bits
of news to be picked up on, that
would not even have crossed my
mind. I am truly glad that we now
have evidence that even reputable
papers know what a space-filler is.
The Last Issue
My last ever issue of Felix will
come out on Wednesday 24th and
will probably be in more than one
part. The positively last deadline for
submissions is this Monday at
12.30pm. After this time I may well
have devised a page plan, and extra
articles will not be fitted in. As I am
not bound to this place for much
longer, there are no restraints on my
being appallingly rude to people
handing things in late. If anybody
comes in with an article after
Monday, I will tear it up in front
of them and ram the pieces where
the sun don't shine.

When up in Scotland, this quaint word I come upon
I have to snip it short, and call it scone.
And yet we have a Coronation Stone
Brought down from Scotland from a place called Scone,
Where toasted cakes with butter spread thereon
Are called by the same name, but ryhmed with shone.
But down in England's Southern Shires, when I'm alone,
I love soft, mellower sounds and call it scone.

HUB'S Midsummer
The Enemy Within's Response Answered
Dear Adam,
For the benefit of IC ConSoc, a
brief summary of 'The Enemy
Within.'
1. The implementation of the
students' charter now looks
imminent. It will be discussed at a
meeting in Ten Downing Street on
19 June.
2. Conservative Students are setting
the pace in student reforms, and are
exercising an influence far in excess
of their status.
3. The students' charter will be used
by Conservative Students to launch
yet another attack on the NUS.
4. This attack is euphemistically
known as voluntary membership.
5. Voluntary membership will
seriously, if not fatally, damage all
students unions, threatening all the
activities and societies that they
fund.
6. IC ConSoc received £520 of
union money last year and has bid
for £535 this year.
7. It is not unreasonable to assume
that this money will be partially
used to campaign for voluntary
membership.
8. In this way, ConSoc is using
union money toseriously damage IC
Union. ConSoc is the 'enemy
within'.
Now compare this with the points
of relevance in their letter of last
week:
1. IC ConSoc does not use union
money to affiliate to the
Conservative Party in any form.
2. IC ConSoc does, however,
affiliate to the Greater London Area
Conservatives, at the cost of £10
from ConSoc membership
subscriptions.
3. Money received from the union
is not used to stimulate greater
student interest in centre-right (sic)
politics.
Such pathetic evasion. If ever
there was a letter that failed to
answer an article, this is it. The
letter says nothing, absolutely
nothing, about the students' charter,
the influence of Conservative
Students in setting Government
policy, or the effects of voluntary
membership.
The information which I gave
about affiliation to Conservative
Students came from both the
chairman and national secretary of
Conservative Students, in live
interviews broadcast on IC Radio.
To be absolutely sure, I had this
information verified by a former
chairman of IC ConSoc.This year's
ConSoc chairman doesn't seem to
be aware of his own position. Is
Mark fully aware of the facts?
As for centre right politics, what
exactly is he talking about? Centre
right normally means right of
centre, and that certainly isn't
ConSoc. If Mark is redefining
centre right as right of centre,
surely even that is just a tad socialist
for the offshoot of the Federation
of Conservative Students?
The personal attacks are best
ignored. Being a firm follower of
the Guardian's Will Hutton, I
regarded the 1992 election as one
to lose. Incidentally, anything about
the collapse of IC Labour should be
referred to Mark Schaeffer.
Perhaps ConSoc will make a
more constructive response in
future. Hopefully, they won't take
so long about it next time.
Wishing you fruitful travelling in
the land of the East. Enjoy your
deserved retirement (OBN),
Declan Curry.
(Still) News Editor.
