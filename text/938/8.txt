The False Servant Expatria
Two hundred and sixty years after
it was written by Marivaux, The
False Servant has its British
premiere at the Gate Theatre.
Written at a time when the French
aristocracy was beginning to show
signs of decadence, it is a play full
of deceit and disguise. A young lady
of considerable fortune is supposed
to marry someone chosen by her
brother. Wanting to meet him and
find out his 'real self, she disguises
herself as Chevalier, becomes his
friend, and seduces his mistress. It
is a complex play in which no one
is simply in love, but everyone has
a lust for financial gain; the
aristocrat Lelio whose criterion for
marriage is the yearly earnings of
the bride and Trivelin the servant
of Chevalier who is ready to sell
every secret he knows or he thinks
he knows. Each character puts on
a mask in order to impress and
manipulate. Crispin Redman as
Lelio and William Hope as Trivelin
play their parts excellently. The
settings of the play are interesting
and together with the music and the
costumes they help to create the
atmosphere of the period. However
the acting of two of the main
'Darling can I eat your earring ?'
characters is a bit disappointing.

The descendents of Expatria's first
colonists from Earth have rejected
technology. When Mathias, heir to
the primacy of Newest Delhi, wants
to reintroduce the old technologies
he is framed for his father's murder
and has to flee. He gets recruited
by a research team trying to relearn
technology and ends up discovering
messages are coming from Orbit.
Surprise, surprise, after a millenia
of silence, Earth has come back.
This book is described as being
rich in atmosphere, characters and
ideas. To be quite honest, I found
it boring. Halfway through,
Mathias has only just joined the
research team with no sign of earth
whatsoever. The plot isn't rich, just
cumbersome and in the end I put the
book down and didn't pick it up
again. This is the first book in a two
book series. I'm not going to be
buying number two. The ideas are
old, the characters lack character
and the atmosphere is non-existent.
I can only asume the author knew
the publisher. A book well worth
ignoring.
Fob.

Pond Life
This superb play uses the story of
a day in the life of a group of friends
in a South Yorkshire mining village
to explore the insecurities and
uncertainties of growing up.
Around the tale of the day and of
the fishing expedition that night
there is a great deal of humour, with
some of the funniest moments being
where the watcher is reminded of
her or his own childhood attitudes
and behaviour. It is not all laughs,
though, and the ending leaves you
in a thoughtful mood.
The characters are very easy to
identify with, each one having
recognisable echoes of us all. A
whole gamut of ages is presented,
from early teens to early twenties,
Fishing for compliments
reflecting the difficult stages of
growing up.
The acting was excellent at all
times, and the set was extremely
well designed and put together.
Watch out for the pond!
This is brilliant! Sod Wayne's
World, spend six quid on this, it is
far, far better!
