5 Things Tablets are/have killing/ed
I cannot count the amount of times
I saw a toddler on a tablet. While in-
herently this is not something nega-
tive, it does make me a bit sad. Yes,
there are some great apps out there
that help your child learn and grow,
but more often than not these kids
are playing angry birds which is not
as positive as you may think (e.g.
subconscious hatred towards green
pigs)! Playing outside and exploring
the world, making a castle out of a
few pillows with your imagination
and just using up that boundless
energy that children seem to pos-
sess is something that is lost when
you hand your child a tablet. It is
easier, and allows for the parents
In our day and age everything has a
camera attached to it. Your phone,
your mp3 player, my god, even your
fridge could have a camera for all we
know. Therefore it is not a surprise
that your tablet has a camera. How
many times have you seen someone
with their tablet in the air, awkwardly
trying to take a picture? Yes, I agree
with you, too many times (if you are
one of those people who tries to do
this, I curse you to hell). Why would
you use this relatively heavy device,
with an inferior camera to take pic-
tures? It is unwieldy, and compared
to the camera that you could pull out
from your camera the quality of the
taken picture will be much worse!
These guys used to be the bee’s
knees. Predicted to be the future of
portable computing these guys have
been almost completely forgotten. I
mean, if you compare the elegance
of a touch screen device which has
its own dedicated OS, which does
not feeling like a cut down version,
and less able to actually do things.
The downfall of the netbook can
largely also be attributed to the lack
of actual usability. They had small
screens, almost non-existent mem-
ory and no RAM whatsoever. No
point in carrying one around if you
cannot do everything you wanted to.
While I believe paper and books
will never be entirely killed off in
our life times, tablets have certainly
lead to a revolution that has reduced
the amount there are used and pro-
duced. Ebooks have taken off, lead-
ing to their own pros and cons, you
see more and more students tak-
ing notes with iPads and my print-
ing credit has sky rocketed since
I got a tablet. Now I am not say-
ing this is positive or negative, that
is for you to decide, but anything
that reduces even a tiny amount
of the paper we waste should be
considered in a positive light.

Papers and Books
to have some downtime, but maybe
once in a while spend time with your
child and interact with them without
the help of an electronic medium.
This may be similar to the one ear-
lier, however the eﬀect has been felt
much more keenly. The internet my
have started oﬀ the newspapers de-
cline, however tablets are starting to
accelerate it! Instead of having to buy
your newspaper from the local agent,
or having it delivered to your door,
you can just download it on your tab-
let with no hassle whatsoever. This
change in the behaviour of the con-
sumers has alarmed some newspapers
and publications so far that some have
left their physical presence behind
entirely and now inhabit the internet.
There is no doubt that technologi-
cal advancements over the past few
decades have had immense impact
on our society. Those of us liv-
ing comfortable lives in developed
countries celebrate the latest gadg-
ets and how they have made our
lives even simpler. But meanwhile,
there are still many people out there
who are struggling to gain access to
clean water, affordable healthcare
and basic education. Why has mod-
ern technology overlooked them?
According to recent studies by
NGOs and social enterprises, over
2 billion people in the developing
world lack access to basic infor-
mation and communication tech-
nologies (NoPC). More than 72
million children around the world
remain unschooled (Humanium)
and over 1 billion people rely on
unsafe sources of water (UN). If
we can use technology to bet-
ter our already comfortable lives,
we certainly can do more using
technology to make a difference
to the lives of the less fortunate.
The rise of modern technology
has made production costs lower,
administering healthcare treat-
ments easier and dissemination of
information quicker. This makes
technology one of the key compo-
nents in accelerating social changes,
by enabling people to do more and
give more. Many individuals and
organisations have seen the poten-
tial in transforming the social sec-
tor through technology, and have
been actively coming up with tech-
nological solutions that promise to
alleviate pressing social problems.
Take for example, PEEK, a Lon-
don-based group, who are making
high quality eye care portable, cost
effective and intuitive in develop-
ing countries possible through the
use of smart-phone cameras. Not
only are smartphones portable and
cost-effective, its simplicity in us-
age empowers more health work-
ers to diagnose eye diseases and
manage such treatments anywhere
in the world. With 285 million
visually impaired people world-
wide, PEEK presents a much-
needed alternative to high cost
diagnostic tests that are available
mostly in high-income countries.
The pervasiveness of social net-
works in today’s world also presents
great opportunities to raise aware-
ness about social issues. In this
aspect, Thunderclap helps causes
amplify their messages by pushing a

Andrew Ng on fostering social change through technology
sations can now reach out to larger
audiences with greater ease and ef-
ficiency, by leveraging the power
of social connections on the web.
Ultimately, bringing about so-
cial change through technology is
not about using the most advanced
gadgets, but applying existing
ones to support and direct them.
If you have yet to notice, the com-
mon ground between the examples
above and many others is that only
existing technology are used, with
slight modifications to address the
problems directly. We should keep
in mind that inventing new tech-
nology doesn’t help to solve so-
cial issues - applying them does.
If you would like to be further
inspired by how technology can be
used to create social change and
empower people to do more so-
cial good, come along to CtrlAlt/

rial College London on 30th No-
vember. From a series of exciting
talks, interactive workshops, panel
discussion and an “Ideathon”, Ctr-

technology projects with social
impacts and champion new ones.
