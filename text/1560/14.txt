The Magic Flute needs a fairy godmother
Emiel De Lange is unimpressed by the ENOʼs theatrical wizardry
I
n this fairy tale, Prince Tamino
is sent to rescue his love Pamina,
daughter of the Queen of the
Night. When he ﬁnds and frees
her, he discovers that her captor,
Sarastro, is actually the good guy and
decides to be initiated into his order.
Meanwhile Tamino’s companion,
the bird-catcher Papageno, has given
up on initiation and simply wants
someone to love. The power of music;
the magic ﬂute and the enchanting
bells, helps them both to succeed.
‘Magic’ is the key word in Mozart’s
Magic Flute, and without it the plot
makes little sense. But magic is what
is missing in this otherwise exciting
production. Instead, we are treated
to a diﬀerent sort of magic – that of
stage-craft. Simon McBurney has
chosen to present his Magic Flute
in black and white; a dark space, the
action lit with bright white lights.
Everyone is dressed in similarly bland
colours with the occasional dull green
or brown thrown in. Indeed, the only
two characters of any colour at all,
and only two with which we establish
a real connection, are Papageno and
Papagena. The rest come across as
lifeless, and so despite their trials, by
the end one hardly feels as if anything
has happened at all.
The ﬁrst act seems to set up a
dichotomy between the irrational,
magical world of the night, and

Sarastro’s rational world of knowledge
inhabited by men and women in suits.
It’s ambiguous which of the two worlds
we should prefer, and disappointingly
the idea seems to disappear without
any synthesis or resolution. Many
such interesting ideas are thrown
about without developing or cohering.
Again, by the end one wonders
whether anything has happened at all.
The orchestra plays very well under
young conductor Gergely Madaras, if
a little monochromatic – but I suppose
this is a theme here. The singers too
seem restrained and underwhelming,
particularly Götz’s Queen of the Night
whose entrance is a whimper and
whose famous coloratura leaps are a
little shaky. Again only the Papageno
pair really characterise their parts
and leave us with an impression of
humanity, while Creswell’s Sarastro
is full and imposing and Galliford’s
Monostatos is amusingly creepy.
McBurney’s theatrical displays are
enough to provide a full evening’s
entertainment. I won’t give away
his tricks, but there are a few grand
moments of illusion in a generally
impressive and unique staging. Clever
use is made of video projections which
blend onto the set and interact with
the characters. Another nice touch
is the use of a live Foley to create the
sound eﬀects, even if the presence on
stage is distracting and unnecessary –
a gimmick perhaps. There is humour
too in this production, particularly
when the fourth wall is broken, and
the interactions with the orchestra are
worth a chuckle.
As fantastic and entertaining as
the performance may be, in the end
we leave the theatre left with little.
The amusement and wizardry on
display are not enough, perhaps even
detrimental, to a real experience of
Schikaneder and Mozart’s rich cast
of characters, magic and music.
The admittedly frequent theatrical
spectacles are bright sparks but the
tinder doesn’t succeed in catching ﬁre.

Papageno and Papagena, played by Ben Johnson and Devon Guthrie, swirling around on stage
Angolan Civil War makes powerful subject matter
Play at the new Park Theatre is breathtaking, says Blaise Verhasselt
S
outh Africa, 1989, and Josh
Gilmore is poised to become
the first white man to break
the 10-second barrier for the
100m, and be made a hero
by the racist regime. He is
conscripted while the South African
Defence Force is taking an unofficial
part in the Angolan Civil War, under
the command of Captain Papa Louw.
This is Angola. One wrong turn and
you vanish forever, my brother.
They capture a wounded and
somewhat distinguished black
freedom fighter, and Papa orders
Josh to carry him back to the border
to be interrogated. But as they
painfully make their way through the
bush, a bond is forged between the
conscripted soldier and the prisoner,
that will forever change Josh’s views
on his society.
The Dead Wait is written by and
stars Paul Herzberg (Papa Louw),
who served in the South African
army in Angola himself. Through
this breath-taking play, Herzberg
reveals the struggles faced by a
divided continent, finding himself a
few years before the end of both the
Apartheid and the Cold War. The
play is focused on three characters
incarnating opposed concepts, on
the eve of a major historical leap:
Papa Louw, the aging, cultivated
but impulsive officer, incarnates the
white racist, brutal and traumatised
authority, hardly ruling South
Africa with a minority under the
Apartheid. He will have to face the
truth commission in the 1990s.
George Jozana (Maynard Eziashi),
aging African National Congress
leader in exile in Europe for many
years, comes back to Africa with
the hope that his homeland will
soon recover peace, freedom
and democracy. Josh Gilmore
(Austin Hardiman), the white
athlete, caries the hopes of his
country’s government. As the
new generation, he is also able to
incarnate reconciliation between his
countrymen.
The interactions of this trio are
extremely rich and well exploited
by Herzberg, whilst the intimate
stage of the Park Theatre brings
all the audience in an astonishing
experience under Joe Harmston’s
direction. Clearly, The Dead Wait
is an excellent play to go to with
friends in London’s newest, hippest
arts venue. The only drawback is
the theatre’s location, slightly north
of the West End. But surely Zone 2
is not enough to discourage drama
amateurs! To them, I say it’s a very
good play, with excellent actors and
an interesting historical basis: you
should go!
