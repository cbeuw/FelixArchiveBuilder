A
s Candy Bar, London’s
award winning Lesbian
bar announces that
it will be closing its
doors for the last time
in January, this is a question that
many gay and bisexual women have
been asking. Candy is the latest in
a long list of lesbian bars and clubs
who have lost their homes in recent
years including G Spot, Glass bar
and Chocolate Lounge. This leaves a
signiﬁcant gap in the market, as it is
currently the only remaining female
only space in Soho (men may enter,
but not unaccompanied). This is a fact
that I ﬁnd shocking and saddening
in such a diverse and cosmopolitan
city as London. Candy’s motto is
‘Run by Girls, For Girls’, which really
emphasises the importance of a
space in which women can feel safe,
and are protected from the negative
attention which sadly follows same sex
encounters in many environments.
Increased costs for leasing property
in London have forced the owners of
many venues to sell up and instead
organise events for gay and bisexual
women without a ﬁxed location. Even
the most popular of these events,
such as Twat Boutique, no longer
have a regular visible presence in the
London club scene. This prevents the
formation of a community around a
certain place, and makes it far more
diﬃcult to go out, as it is less possible
to be spontaneous.
As a gay or bisexual woman, you
are in the minority, which makes it
far harder to meet people (or say,
to pull people) than it would be for
heterosexual women, purely for ease of
identiﬁcation and the numbers game.
This is why I think it’s so important
that somewhere like Candy exists; I
think that it is crucial that members
of the LBGT community have access
to the same opportunities as someone
who is heterosexual.
What is even more disappointing is
that Candy was one of the few gay bars
that had wheelchair access, at least
on the ground ﬂoor. As a wheelchair
user, I am very used to having to make
enquiries as to whether or not a venue
I haven’t visited before has step free

access.
In response to the closure of Candy,
the KuBar plans to radically overhaul
its premises to make the entire lower
ground ﬂoor into “KuBar Girls”, which
while decreasing the size of the women
only space, aims to remain in keeping
with the original ethos of Candy:
being run by girls, for girls. The new
bar will have only female bouncers,
and a separate entrance to the ground
level KuBar. However, the space is
being created through the renovation
of the existing premises, which do not
currently provide wheelchair access to
the lower level.
I, as well as several others, have
written to KuBar asking them for
reassurance that they will be putting
a lift in as part of the refurbishment.
I have not yet received a response! If
this adaption is not made, this will
place severe limitations on women
who wish to go to gay bars but require
step free access.
I am writing this article to ask others
who care about LGBT rights and
wheelchair users having access, to sign
the petition (http://chn.ge/18srOyE),
and to write to the KuBar as well. For
more information, and to keep up with
the campaign please join the Facebook
group (Make Ku Bar Girls Wheelchair
Accessible).

Confessions of a GTA: Part 5
W
eek 6 in a GTA
calendar is
ﬁlled with the
undergraduates’
horror of ﬁfth
week mid-term tests. I honestly never
thought that marking papers could
be worse than sitting them. I was
certain that this would be the subject
of my confession today. However,
on Monday I was highly irritated,
which I know is fairly easy for me, but
nevertheless this kind of behaviour
should be stamped out immediately
as it was certainly not like this in my
day...
I teach a class to a pretty cool crew
of freshers on Mondays. During the
last ﬁve minutes of a tough tutorial, I
went over to a guy with his hand up.
He was stuck on part of the problem,
nothing out of the ordinary. I started
to explain his mistake. Immediately
GTAs are helpful only when asked nicely
he said, “I don’t understand”. As I had
barely said anything yet, this seemed
unquestionable. So I asked him what
he did not understand, only to get,
“everything” as the response. To start
with, this is irritating. As a GTA, I am
not contracted to re-explain the entire
course up to now to him, particularly
in the last ﬁve minutes of a tutorial,
but perhaps he is feeling hopeless. We
have all felt that way at some point at
Imperial, after all. Trying to be patient,
I ask him if he understood last week’s
problems, and he said he had done
them all as they were “ridiculously
easy”. His words not mine.` I pointed
out that his mistake was in part of the
problem that was covered the previous
week. This was his reply:
‘You are obviously talking rubbish
because I have got this question right.
The lecturer knows as little as you on
this topic. I did this all at school and
it was much easier with this method
I have done here. I don’t know why I
bothered coming.’
My immediate response was that I
didn’t know why he bothered asking
me! If you are so sure of your answer
what is the point in a second opinion?
I mean seriously, what is a GTA’s
motive to lie? We are deﬁnitely not
paid enough. I also wanted to point
out I was top ten in my year, thank
you very much, and passed this course
pretty damn well (I’m doing a PhD in
it), but then I felt stupid for wanting to
justify myself to an 18 year old. What
I couldn’t say was “Good luck with
that method then, fresher. If you enjoy
failing carry on.”
On relating this to a fellow GTA,
she told me another quite startling
story. One of her students decided
to email her to say that he didn’t do
the homework and didn’t turn up to
the (compulsory attendance) tutorial,
because he deﬁnitely didn’t receive the
email she sent him telling him when it
was. Noting kindly in the e-mail that
in future could she please ensure that
he gets them? Looking down the email
my friend saw he had sent this lovely
note by replying to the email she had
sent him in the ﬁrst place. Nice.
So the subject of this week’s
confession?
GTA’s do not care if you fail or not.
No point arguing with us or lying
to us. All we are there to do is help.
Maybe you can help yourself and just
ask us nicely.
