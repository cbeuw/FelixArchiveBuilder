FRIDAY 15 NOV
MUSIC
ew York duo Ms Mr
took to the stage
of Shepherd’s Bush
Empire before a
crowd of excited fans
before fulﬁlling all expectations and
pleasing their audience.
Their debut album Secondhand
Rapture was released in May this year
and despite making an unremarkable
dent in the charts they nonetheless
managed to recruit a group of loyal
followers to pack out the century-old
venue.
Mixing their self-proclaimed
ballads with more upbeat-danceable
songs, their inoﬀensive pop was
brought to life by two other musicians
for the live band. The drummer was
a great addition, bringing to life the
thumping beats striking their way
through tracks such as “Fantasy” a
pounding and dramatic pop song, and
“Bones” the epitome of their darker,
gothic side.
Just as large was vocalist Lizzy
Paplinger’s beautiful voice. She hit all
the notes as perfect as those on the
album and perhaps went even further.
She sung the way that you could tell
her hand had crafted all the lyrics.
It was disappointing, however, that
some of the synth couldn’t replaced
with more live instruments which
would have given the set more variety
compared to the studio versions.
Despite the limited number of
songs form one album, an injection
of Arctic Monkeys’ “Do I Wanna
Know “was a stunning cover. Turning
it into a Ms Mr ballad, it sounded like
it could have been a beautiful original
were it not for obviously British lyrics
such as “summat” and “settee”.
One of my favourite parts about
the show had to be Paplinger’s
multicoloured hair which glowed
green under darkness as though
it were covered all over in green
ﬂuorescent protein.
It was also sweet to see Paplinger
herself glowing with glee at the
thought of playing Shepherd’s Bush
Empire. She could not stop smiling
all the way through, even as she
bellowed her biggest notes. When the
audience joined in for favourites, and
especially their ﬁnal song Hurricane,

Emielʼs Guide to
Ask someone to
name a ‘Classical’
composer and
they’ll reply with
Bach, Mozart or
Beethoven. The
music we’ve dis-
cussed so far is,
I’ll admit, a little
bit ‘niche’; rarely
performed in the
concert hall, and
probably the re-
serve of a special
group of early
music enthusi-
asts. Still, I’m
going to continue my slow march
through history – not only because
the foundations of music are being
laid, but also because you may ac-
tually like some of what you hear!
I certainly do; the music of these
early periods has a certain purity,
(to modern ears) and mysticism to
it not seen again until the 20th cen-
tury. So, I hope you keep reading,
and once again there should be mu-
sical examples on the Felix website
to give you a taste.
As I mentioned two weeks ago,
the Abbess Hildegard von Bingen
is often considered the first real
musical artist. From a young age she
experienced visions, and eventually
became Abbess of a convent in the
Rhine valley. Her music was unique
for its time and reflected her mysti-
cal and visionary outlook on life.
While her contemporaries were still
obsessed with the platonic achieve-
ment of a perfect Musica, she wrote
music that is poetic and emotive.
This effect was created through ir-
regularity, both in the music and
text; her verses only pair loosely,
suggesting variation rather than
repetition, while the words rarely
rhyme and are irregularly accented.
The musical line too roams over an
unprecedented range of notes and
is hard to pin down into a precise
mode. She called her music a “sym-
phony of the harmony of heavenly
revelations”.
Through the 12th Century, music
made massive leaps as a result of
ever clearer notation. Academic
cathedral schools began to flourish
and musicians began to write mu-
sic of increasing complexity. Prime
among these was the cathedral of
Notre Dame in Paris, which would
dominate the musical world for the
next 100 years.
One of the great innovations here
was polyphony, music written with
multiple independent lines. Polyph-
ony has likely always been in use,
and in the 12th Century it was of-
ten used as an improvisation on the
written monophonic line. Yet at No-
tre Dame it became an art in itself
and was notated. Polyphony almost
became synonymous with composi-
tion. The first polyphonic composi-
tions were simple drone notes, with
another line playing on top of it, or
two lines moving parallel at the in-
terval of a fifth. However, the need
for ’occursus’, or for the two notes
to meet together at the end neces-
sitates that they move in a non-
parallel fashion! When two lines
move in such a way, different inter-
vals will exist between them, some
dissonant and some consonant.
Hence, the art of polyphony lies in
how to manage these intervals so
that they can move independently
and still create a harmonic ‘whole’.
Our friend Guido of Arezzo wrote
the first treatise on polyphony and
demonstrated multiple ‘solutions’,
leaving the choice up to the com-
poser; this marked an important
shift in attitude towards music as a
creative art.
Most of what we know from the
Notre Dame school comes from an
anonymous source. It seems the two
greatest composers were Léonin
(1150s – 1201) and Perotin (fl. C.
1200), both known as ‘Magistra’,
or masters. From Perotin, we have
the first surviving piece with 4-part
polyphony, but both made massive
advances in our understanding of
rhythm and harmony. Perotin often
moved to his occursus via the most
dissonant (or ugly) intervals pos-
sible (think back to Pythagoras’s
frequency ratios), creating a great
sense of relief or resolution. This
harmonic ‘movement’ would even-
tually blossom into our current sys-
tem of tonal harmony. In two weeks
I will elaborate on my claims about
rhythm and we will explore the next
great flowering of music, the Ars
Nova, and why Perotin and Léonin
became known as the Ars Antiqua.

In other news...
McFly and Busted are to form a ʻsuperʼgroup
for a series of arena tours in 2014. Innovatively
called McBusted, the group will appear on the
BBCʼs Children in Need on Friday. However,
the news that Charlie Simpson is doing a
Robbie and not joining his fellow band mates
may prove too devastating for some.
Lily Allen has revealed a new song in which
she derides the sexism and mysogeny in the
music industry. The singer takes aim and Robin
Thickeʼs ʻBlurred Linesʼ and Miley Cyrus. The Daily Mail reported this by totally
missing the point and commenting on how “slim” Allen looked.
Justin Timberlake has announced yet more dates for his forthcoming tour which
will take in pretty much every city in America, and even a few over this side of the
pond. Venues include the MGM Grand, Las Vegas and the Phones 4u Arena in
Manchester.

she looked as though she was about to
wet herself with excitement. Unlike
the lyrics in Fantasy, it really was all
Ms Mr wanted it to be.
No encore was performed as the
two-piece explained that they were no
Beyoncé... yet. With a voice so huge
and a pop-style that is easy to enjoy
and doesn’t perplex or alienate the
listener, it is not out of the question. It
also helps to have that “independent
woman attitude” which bounces
oﬀ Paplinger, especially when she
dedicated a big “Fuck you!” before
playing “Think of You” to all the exes
audience member.
