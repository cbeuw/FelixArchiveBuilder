Researchers conclude that coffee first thing in the morning might not be as effective as you thought
Are you drinking it right?
Caffeine Statistics
The coursework season has descended
at Imperial - many of us are spending
endless hours at the library. No matter
if you are writing up your research
project on rotor stator disk rim sealing,
a model of the thermal structure of the
North American lithosphere, or an
essay answering the question “What
is a gene?”, you are probably looking
for ways to top up your body’s caﬀeine
level every now and then. If you want
to make the most of your tea / coﬀee
/ Redbull / Monster, you might want
to read on.
Scientists at Uniformed Services
University of the Health Sciences
in Bethesda, Maryland, USA, have
worked out that the best time to get a
daily hit of caﬀeine is between 9:30am
and 11:30am.
The Science
Steven Miller, a neuroscientist who
took part in the research, explained
that this is due to how caﬀeine
interacts with a key hormone – called
cortisol. This hormone helps to
regulate the body’s own internal clock
and promotes alertness.
After a night’s sleep, cortisol levels
are naturally high and can remain high
for up to an hour afterwards, peaking
between 8am and 9am on average.
Mr Miller argues it is better to then
drink caﬀeine after this peak as it
promotes cortisol production.
He said a tolerance of caﬀeine may be
developed inside the body if we drink
coﬀee when the level of this hormone
is high. This is simply because your
body does not need this extra dose
of caﬀeine. The natural cortisol peak
forms part of your 24 hour rhythm -
same reason why you are tired in the
evening.
Miller stated that one of the key
principles of pharmacology is use a
drug when it is needed. Otherwise,
we can develop tolerance to a drug
administered at the same dose. This
implies that the same cup of morning
coﬀee will become less eﬀective
and you might need an extra shot of
espresso for your morning coﬀee to be
as eﬀective.
Mr Miller also found that cortisol
also peaks between noon and 1pm,
also from 5:30 to 6:30pm. He suggested
that having a caﬀeine dose between
these pikes will be most eﬀective.
Of course, the cortisol cycle will
vary from person to person, so will
the perfect time to have your cup of
coﬀee or can of Redbull. The time you
normally wake up will also aﬀect this
time - early risers may ﬁnd their ideal
time is earlier than those who get to
enjoy a lie in.
So what is cortisol?
Cortisol helps to increase glucose
in the bloodstream by converting
from stores of energy. This hormone
produced in high levels especially in
times of stress. This energy release
makes us more alert in the morning,
but making us hungry at the same
time.
Scientists have also found that
cortisol is also responsible for
synchronising the internal daily
rhythms that operate in the body.

Machine to tell Horses from Cows
Remember the horse meat scandal
earlier in the year? To ensure you
are getting what you think you are
buying, retailers can soon distinguish
between beef and horsemeat with a
new bench-top device built by British
engineers.
This machine, developed by Oxford
Instruments and the Institute of Food
Research, is capable of identifying
meat before it is processed by
analysing the diﬀerent fatty acids
in the meat. Currently the machine
can recognise horses, cows, geese,
pigs and sheep. The team is currently
working on identifying rat meat.
“Each fat gives oﬀ a diﬀerent signal,”
said Paul Bunting, sales director
at Oxford Instruments. “The great
advantage of this is that rather than
spending £500 to send oﬀ meat for
DNA-testing and waiting up to a week
for the result, they can use this and get
results in minutes.”

the suggested daily intake of caffeine for a
average person. 200mg if you’re pregnant.
400mg
How much?
• 1 mug of instant coﬀee: 100mg
• 1 mug of ﬁlter coﬀee: 140mg
• 1 mug of tea: 75mg
• 1 can of cola: 40mg
• 1 can of ‘energy’ drink: up to 80mg
• 1 x 50g bar of plain chocolate: up to 50mg
• 1 x 50g bar of milk chocolate: up to 25mg
So if you have...
• two bars of plain chocolate and two mugs of ﬁlter coﬀee, or
• four mugs of tea and two can of cola, or
• two mugs of instant coﬀee and two cans of energy drink
That’s your 400mg for the day!
Too much caffeine
There are several side eﬀects with a caﬀeine overdose. This includes
shakes, make you anxious, headachey, sleepless and might upset your
stomach too.
