SCIENCE
Inside the Collider: a review of the new exhibition

ou’re very lucky to see
this,” a professor with a
bright orange waistcoat
and bow tie tells us.
“Usually, only scientists
are allowed at internal meetings.”
We were sat in a mock up of CERN’s
lecture theatre; projected on the
wall were the professor and other
attendees. I don’t know if anyone
at CERN actually dresses like that,
but the eccentric academic image is
charming and not too innacurate.
This is the introduction to Collider: a
reconstruction of the meeting where
the observation of the Higgs boson
was ﬁrst announced, at the Sceience
Musuem.
The professor, the particle beam
controller and two PhD students talk
us through the days leading up to the
announcement, interspersed with
descriptions of the Large Hadron
Collider and a history going back
to J.J. Thompson’s discovery of the
electron: his own cathode ray tube is
one of the exhibition pieces. There’s
even a cameo appearance from Brian
Cox as a coﬀe-running intern.
The story is a personal rather than
technical one, focussing on the
friendly rivalry between the ATLAS
and CMS experiments and the sheer
anticipation and excitement that come
with each unblinding – the name
given to the revelation of collision
data to a researcher, done only after
the analytical methods had been
determined to eliminate bias.
One of the students reveals that she’s
giving the presentation – she was the
one who ﬁrst saw the Higgs after the
unblinding.
Even watching a reconstruction, I
could feel the tension – the collective
eﬀort of 10,000 engineers and
scientists over ten years, working to
prove a theory ﬁrst published half a
century ago.
We’re shown a clip from the real
announcement before the professor
invites us to see the LHC tunnel,
ushering us in to the rest of the
exhibition.
A twisted entrance simulates the
lift ride down, and we’re brought to
a curved corridor where pieces of the
accelerator are on display along with
quirky whiteboards that explain the
theory behind the hunt for the Higgs.
A circular room hosts a huge
projected wireframe simulation
of beam acceleration and particle
collison, awesome in scale and a little
dizzying. Protons are represented as
balls covered in cute yellow fur – a
decision made under guidance from
researchers from CERN, who have
collaborated to develop the exhibition.
Finally, we enter a model of the
CERN oﬃces, where a video shows us
the PhD student from the introductory
lecture in the minutes just before and
after the unblinding.
Once again, the feeling of the
discovery is captured – but the actual
excitement was far greater, as we were
told by the actual student who ﬁrst
saw the particle, also a guest at the
premiere.
The exhibition corridor I found a
little underwhelming compared to the
videos, but as a science student who
already knows most of the facts, that’s

This is an exhibition to bring visiting
parents along to, for both technical
information and the human story
behind the Higgs boson search.
Professor Higgs and the press collide
Felix Science goes along to the launch of the Science Museumʼs new exhibition
T
his Tuesday saw the launch
of the Science Museum’s
latest exhibition, Collider.
The £1 million exhibition
was developed in close
collaboration with CERN. It provides
an insight into both the workings
of the collider itself, but also takes
visitors through the story of the
discovery of the Higgs Boson, its latest
successful endeavour in its research
into particle physics.
The exhibition itself provides a vir-
tual experience of the conference at
CERN that took place earlier this year,
when they ﬁnally conﬁrmed the boson
to exist. Visitors sit in a mock up lec-
ture theatre, whilst videos projected
on the walls around them show mem-
bers of the CERN team talking about
the discovery. It was here that we were
sat to watch the launch, with speeches
given by those involved to explain just
why Collider is a vital contribution to
the plethora of other exhibitions the
science museum has to oﬀer.
Professor Higgs himself was present
for the unveiling, much to the excite-
ment of the press and the scientiﬁc
community, who turned up bright and
early Tuesday morning to pose their
questions. Universally acknowledged
as a modest man, he rarely makes pub-
lic appearances since the Nobel Prize
that he was awarded in October, and
obviously this was on the agenda for
the press that were asking him ques-
tions.
It was the press correspondent from
the Independent that was the ﬁrst to
breech the subject of Tom Kibble, Im-
perial’s own physicist who contributed
to the boson theory but missed out on
the Nobel Prize.
After enquiring as to whether or
not Higgs has spoken to Kibble since
the award, Higgs was kind enough to
explain as to why Kibble had only just
missed out:
“I think not many people are aware
that in 1964, there were a total of six
people who published papers on the
Standard theory. There was three
groups, two people in Brussels, myself
in Edinburgh, Tom kibble at Imperial
College…the two people in Brussels
were by a long way the ﬁrst but they
actually delayed publication because
they thought there had been mistakes,
but they were still ahead of me.
“The other three at Imperial College
lagged behind at time of publication
and the consequence was that they
were not given credit. When it came
to the awarding of a Nobel prize, the
guidelines seemed to be that there was
no more than three per prize.
“If Robert [Brout, American-Belgian
theoretical physicist] was still alive he
would have been one of the three.
“Because he died, there was a
possible gap as it were…it was to
award the prise to the two survivors of
the ﬁrst three.
“My opinion before the award was
announced…was that if they were
going to award it to three people they
should include Tom Kibble, because
what he wrote, in 1967, was abridged
from my very simple model of 1964…
his role was important and it was a
shame that he was missed out.”
The Director General of CERN,
Professor Rolf Heuer, also attended the
launch, opening with the statement, “I
recognise CERN here.” He went on to
explain what the exhibition was about:
“It will fascinate people, it will give
them a glimpse of what we are doing,
how we are doing it, what is the spirit
of CERN, and what is the spirit of the
people working there.”
His only criticism was about
the oﬃce space displayed in the
exhibition- “The oﬃce space you are
seeing there is much too large for a
single person!”
However it was Ian Blatchford,
Director of the Science Museum
group, which gave the most impressive
opinion on the Collider exhibition.
“You can go and see pearls at the
V&A, you can go and see Columbian
gold at the British museum, you can
see pulled clay at the Tate and you can
see collider here and forgive the ar-
rogance, but of those four, I think, the
most pioneering and the most ambi-
tious is here.”
After the talks, the press were in-
vited to take a look around the exhibi-
tion, which Keir has reviewed below.
We also managed to talk to the re-
searcher who was the ﬁrst to realise
that the boson had transcended from
a theory to reality, Mingming Yang.
The event is now open to the public,
is running for six months, and entry
is free.
