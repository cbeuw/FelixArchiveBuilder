Imperial win at Hillingdon Duathlon
Memories of a completely crappy
rain-ﬁlled start to November were
dried up in a ﬂash as Sunday came
around and the skies cleared for the
2013 Hillingdon Autumn Duathlon.
The local race is a favourite among
the club with a few podiums last year
and a win courtesy of Swiss interna-
tional Jean-Claude who sadly has now
moved back home. Only 15min away
by overground from Paddington, and
on a purpose built mile long racetrack
with no cars or pedestrians to contend
with. The atmosphere was light-heart-
ed as fourteen of Imperial Triathlon
Club’s ﬁnest gathered outside the
front of Hillingdon triathlete’s club
house. The atmosphere inside was just
as relaxed as the hosts seamlessly ran
a faultless race day for us.
The day’s events were split in two,
with the women’s category heading
out ﬁrst, and the men’s category an
hour later. This suited me just ﬁne, as
it would let the girls dry up the track
a little for us from last night’s rain!
The gun was shot and brandishing the
new TriIC trisuit, Sophie Kirk quickly
pulled out an early lead, with Ellie
Howard only a few places behind. By
the end of the ﬁrst mile, sports scholar
and running guru Sophie had pulled
an unprecedented ﬁfteen second lead
on second place. The pack was how-
ever full of strong runners, meaning
Fran, Sian and Ellie had to work hard
to cling to the front contingency be-
fore transition.
A hasty change of shoes, donning
of helmets and awkward running in
cycling cleats saw the girls exit transi-
tion and on to the ten mile bike time
trial. The TriIC women’s team had set
the pace for the race leaders during
the run with Fran exiting transition in
10th, Sian in 11th and Ellie Howard in
8th. The cycle obviously suited Fran
Capel as she put in the second fastest
bike time of the day, only losing out to
our own Sophie Kirk who was begin-
ning to worry the boys in support.
“37 second lead Sophie, slow down!”
as she raced by only three miles into
the course. Team newbies Victo-
ria Kemp and Olivia Bentley looked
strong throughout the course, con-
tinuing to overtake the opposition to
loud and audacious encouragement
from the boys. Before we knew it So-
phie was out on the ﬁnal run and near-
ing the ﬁnish line. Despite a desperate
sprint to get there to cheer her on, she
beat the boys to the ﬁnish to announce
a 1st place smashing of the opposi-
tion, ﬁnishing nearly three minutes
ahead of second place in the women
seniors’ category. Notable ﬁnishers in-
clude another podium position from
Fran in 3rd place, and Sian Morgan
and Ellie Howard clocking 6th and 7th
respectively. The sterling eﬀort from
Sophie did not go unnoticed, as Sky
Ed Hallett gives his account as Imperial take both first and third place.
Sports HD came over for a 5-minute
interview.
The men’s race saw the sun rise
higher and the temperatures become
more bearable. With extremely high
running standards, the leaders left
the main pack for dust with Michael
Kaye and Charlie Houston represent-
ing TriIC at the front, before a strong
bike leg saw Ed Hallett claw back to a
contending position. The track was
smooth and warmed by the sun, giving
the cyclists room to breathe as they
negotiated the sharp hairpin bends
of the course. With only a few very
short hills to wake the legs up, a rela-
tively ﬂat course lends itself to a fast
average pace. With a few laps to go of
the cycle Ed Hallett overtook Michael
Kaye in a ﬁerce internal battle. The
victor between the two gets to present
the other with a second place medal
which they have to wear for the next
race. If the previous loser then wins,
they get to pass on the second place
medal of shame with as much gloating
and abuse as deserved! A committed
eﬀort from Mike to try and keep up
with Ed on the bike was in vain, and
Mike had to watch as he disappeared
out of sight.
Newbie Daniel Tyrie rocked a su-
perb ﬁrst duathlon eﬀort ﬁnishing
18th over all. Ed Hallett managed to
maintain his lead from the bike to ﬁn-
ish 13th despite Mike completing the
second running leg a minute faster.
Mike eventually crossed the line in
15th. Our top male ﬁnisher however,
with a superb second run was Charlie
Houston, ﬁnishing 5th, just missing
out on a podium position!
With sweat evaporating and legs
wobbling we herded into the warmth
of the club house and tucked into re-
covery drinks and banana cake, which
was more like soft banana brownie:
it was epic! So with Fran and Sophie
carrying their alcoholic prizes back to
their car, a contingency climbed on to
their bikes and enjoyed a cycle home
in the bright morning sun.
Thank you to our sponsors Jaguar
Land Rover for their continued sup-
port and the new racing kit!

IC 3s take care of
business against LSA
Julian Iacoponi
3rd XI Football Player
O
n the 6th of
November – a
sinisterly drab
Wednesday (the
kind that taunts
at the beginning of a cold, dark
winter) – ICUAFC 3rd Team
played against LCA Business
School 1st Team. The 5-0 score-
line showed the match to be
(ironically) not just business as
usual for the opposition, and
indeed the same was true of both
teams’ journeys to the match.
Whilst initial good
news of the ﬁxture’s relocation
to IC home ground Harlington
due to plague-like ﬂoods at the
opposition’s pitches, the true tone
was soon set as it became apparent
that ‘Little’ Harlington – the bitter,
besmirched and forgotten little
brother to the main Harlington
complex – was to be our allocated
changing room.
The public transport over
to Harlington was dominated by
characteristically uncharismatic 3s
silence, when it became chillingly
apparent that there was something
oﬀ about the normal bus route
to the grounds… a diversion. A
gruesome traﬃc incident right
outside the desired Harlington
bus stop had left the 3s stranded,
up the creek without a paddle…
Luckily, a paddle wasn’t quite
needed, though with the blustering
wind a sail could have helped. Not
so luckily however, it left the 3s
with one last resort: to yomp it
all the way to the grounds. There
really was nothing fun about this
diversion.
Half an hour later –
over 2 miles traversed, endless
leafy puddles avoided, and even
an idea for a new pub-crawl
hatched (#Harling10) – we made
it! However, this was only to ﬁnd
the opposition to be struggling
yet more with the delays… This
heathen trot to Harlington will
never be forgotten – it’s minibuses
all the way for 3s now (not actually
true, but it should be)!.
When the football ﬁnally arrived,
the referee unfortunately had not.
Despite beginning the match
with an LCA player as the oﬃcial
however, the 3s had a quick start,
taking advantage of the extra pre-
match warm-up time. Francis
Nwobu and Tyrone Scille hassled
the LCA back four relentlessly,
until an early reward came as great
interplay between the front 2 lead
to a sweet ﬁnish from Tyrone. A
similar move soon after led to an
even sweeter Henry-esque ﬁnish
into the top corner from the in-
form striker. With the referee being
kind enough to join for the last
15 minutes of the half, it was 2-0
IC 3s, and despite some sloppily
squandered chances to get that
killer third goal, the team began to
take full control of the match, with
centre-backs Jack ‘The Fresher’
Peacock (a.k.a Club Historian) and
Vincent Avena imposing their will
in defence.
The second half began worse for
the 3s, with some careless passes
leading to uncomfortable spells of
pressure in the IC half. LCA’s best
player,anall-controllingYayaToure
type, was starting to inﬂuence
the game more and more. Sanjiv
Dutt stood ﬁrm in goal, sweeping
away any half snippets at goal and
organizing the defence in front of
him. But at 2-0, IC were still in an
uncomfortably vulnerable position.
As more chances begged and
pleaded and pled and entreated
for the 3s attack, nerves began to
jangle, with the memory of a recent
2-4 loss – from 2-0 up – etched
all too vividly into the collective
memory.
Then, suddenly, a spark came:
a booming Taha Butt challenge
on the LCA playmaker lead to
Faidon Mitzalis (a.k.a International
Man of Mystery, IMoM) nicking
the ball round the opposing full-
back, which, after a series of slick
slide-rule passes teasing the LCA
defence, led to a clinical drive
into the side netting by captain
Myles Jarvis. That goal was critical
in cementing conﬁdence and
expelling those cretins of concern
that were creeping into the contest,
and the 3s began to light up too hot
and bright for the LCA men. It was
ﬁreworks time.
Extended periods of goal-
threatening pressure followed,
with the quality in the IC team a
class above their LCA counterparts:
winning corners, deep throw-ins
(courtesy of Miles Covers), and
testing the keeper at every chance.
A fourth goal came when one such
corner dropped into the 6 yard box
where numerous 3s were waiting.
A series of half clearances and half
shots led to the ball ricocheting oﬀ
Francis Nbowu and rippling the side
netting, capping oﬀ a stellar triple
goal-and-assist match.
The ﬁfth and ﬁnal goal came
courtesy of LCA’s goalkeeper: a weak
pass out from a goal-kick to one of
his – now demoralised – centre-
backs was sharply intercepted by
Julian Iacoponi, who, despite taking
a heavy touch (sending him on a
direct crash course with both keeper
and centre-back) executed step 3
of those famously infamous Pete
Stillwell instructions – to WANT
IT – and managed to crunch a ﬁnish
through what was a heavy impact
collision.
Special mention goes out to Faidon
Mitzalis who, on one of his frequent
mazy runs foraying in and around
the penalty box, was disgustingly
skewered by an LCA player, leaving
our beloved IMoM stuck on the
sidelines with ankle damage for the
coming weeks. #PrayForFaidon!
Peace out.
