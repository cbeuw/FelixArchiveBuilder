FRIDAY 15 NOV
2002 - Iraq agrees to the terms of the UN
Security Council Resolution 1441, which
is the last we hear of the plucky Middle
Eastern country.
1986 - The Federated States of Micronesia
gains independence from the USA. This
historian remains extremely suspicious of
their motives, I mean, what are they doing
with all that Paciﬁc? Who needs that much
sea? Dodgy.
1982 - Yuri Andropov succeeds Brezhnev
as General Secretary of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union by successfully
completing a Russian Centurion - 100
bottles of vodka in 100 minutes.
1933 - Hugh Gray takes the ﬁrst photo of
the Loch Ness monster. However, feeling
peckish that afternoon he hunts it down
and makes it into a tasty burger.
1918 - The horror and waste of the First
World War ﬁnally ends. Thankfully
everyone works super hard and successfully
avoided in future world conﬂicts.
1675 - Leibniz demonstrates integral
calculus independently of Newton leading
to a ten-year argument between the two on
who was the more massive nerd.
1215 - Fourth Lateran Council deﬁnes
the doctrine of Transubstantiation. This
places a certain amount of theological
importance on the recent wine shortage.
Perhaps a message about the current state
of humanity.
Correction
Dear Handman,
Just a small point but the ﬁrst computer to computer
communications took place in 1966 in an RAF
air defence system called GL161.There were six
computers that could communicate with one another
and as the system was transported by helicopter it
was impossible to know which had arrived on site.
Consequently they all had to be identical with no
one unit in charge of the data transfer. It kept you
safe from airborne attack for some time - but I can’t
say more!!
Regards,
John

CYCLITORIAL
Number Of Self-Referential Articles In Hangman Too High
A
recent study published
this week in Hangman
has found there to be
too high a proportion
of self-referential
articles in the Felix section, Hangman.
Whilst the section still contained 80%
non-Hangman based articles, the
Felix Editor Joe Letts stated that a 20%
self-referential rate was “far too high”
for a “respected” publication such as
Hangman.
T
his week, 75 year old David
Dimbleby got a scorpion
tattoo on his shoulder
which depicted the
predatory arthropod with a
mere six legs.
Whilst biologists have long believed
that scorpions, like other Arachnida,
had a full eight legs, the famous
British broadcaster and presenter has
dispelled that myth.
When reached for comment,
Dimbleby stated, “Listen, we don’t
have scorpions in this country and
there are a lot of myths and legends
surrounding these venomous animals”
“Indeed, one of the most prevalent is
this crazy idea that scorpions have a
excessive eight legs, which is clearly
not the case”
“With a stinger like that, what animal
needs an extra pair of legs?”
At press time, Jonathan Dimbleby was
busy proving the existence of unicorns
by getting one tattooed on his lower
back.
More worrying, perhaps, was that a
staggering 1 in 3 articles containing
images made essentially no reference
to any aspect of the world beyond the
Hangman section.
Some - such as the Hangman Editor,
Hangman - believe that these
numbers of self-reference were, in
fact, enhancing the publication.
However, the vast majority of the Felix
community were in disagreement.
When reached for comment,
Hangman stated that “This section has
long been a trailblazer amongst Felix
sections and we strongly believe that a

he Bike Lane - Given the
recent suggestions that
cycling may be more
dangerous than previously
suspected, this editor feels
that cycling is not nearly dangerous
enough.
This writer calls all drivers and
pedestrians to do everything they can
to increase the danger of the roads to
cyclists.
Indeed, it would appear from the
meagre 3,340 people killed or seriously
injured whilst cycling on Britain’s
roads last year that many people are
not even trying to make cycling more
dangerous.
We must take a moment to
commend the bus drivers of our Great
Capital, London, who’s 1,889 killed or
seriously injured in the last 5 years is
an impressive count. Especially when
one considers this is only constitutes
6% of all accidents involving buses.
Hail to the bus driver.
What is oft forgotten is that the
cyclist, a degenerate sub-species of H.
sapiens, fails to actively avoid one of
the most dangerous of daily activities.
It is therefore our moral duty to
increase the danger of the road to
levels that these lesser humans can
comprehend.
If that fails, it is our evolutionary
imperative to rid our species of such
a danger-accepting sub-set. So, drive
in the cycling lane; put sticks in the
spokes; and throw tacks on your local
roadside. Together we can get rid of
these poor creatures.
