The Season so
far: A Review
James White
Football Columnist
Arsenal
Arsene Wenger must ﬁnally be en-
joying life at the Emirates and, despite
losing at Old Traﬀord, the Gunners
clearly mean business in the title race.
They need to prove they can take the
pressure as in recent seasons they
have suﬀered post-Christmas capitu-
lation.
Aston Villa
The Villans need to sort out their
home form urgently, but in Paul Lam-
bert they have an experienced man-
ager who knows how to win ugly.
They should be aiming for a top half
ﬁnish although mid-table mediocrity
is probably more likely.
Cardiﬀ
The Bluebirds have followed Swan-
sea’s footsteps in throwing up a few
surprises playing an attractive brand
of football. As long as the owner does
not dispense with Malky Mackay’s
services, they can expect to ﬁnish
mid-table.
Chelsea
It hasn’t all been plain sailing for the
Special One on his return to Stam-
ford Bridge. He needs to strike a bal-
ance between ﬂair players and reliable
powerhouses like Mikel and Mata. But
he has the players to potentially win
the title.
Crystal Palace
I’m afraid I can oﬀer Palace no hope
whatsoever of avoiding relegation.
They need a new manager fast to in-
ject some grit into midﬁeld so they
don’t become the next Derby County.
Everton
The Toﬀees are very easy on the eye
and Roberto Martinez is proving just
how good a manager he is. As ever a
top-six ﬁnish should be their target;
that will be even more achievable if
they can turn some of their draws into
wins.
Fulham
The Cottagers have looked like a
Sunday league side at times this sea-
son. Martin Jol needs to ﬁnd a way to
inject some verve into an ageing side
increasingly prone to errors. They are
my dark horses for relegation.
Hull
Steve Bruce’s Tigers have worked ex-
tremely hard to establish a mid-table
position. They must continue to play
to their strengths: a well-organised
defence and taking attacking opportu-
nities when they arrive, and they will
stay well clear of relegation.
Liverpool
The Reds have made a barnstorming
start, thanks largely to Daniel Stur-
ridge and Luis Suarez. They can dream
of a top-four ﬁnish again but do they
have the backup if their attacking stars
succumb to injury or suspension?
Man City
Manuel Pellegrini’s side have one
of the best attacks in Europe and the
Aguero-Negredo partnership has se-
rious potential. It is in defence where
their troubles lie but with Vincent
Kompany soon back from injury a sec-
ond title looks a real possibility.
Man United
Frankly, David Moyes has endured a
torrid start. That killer instinct charac-
teristic of Sir Alex’s Red Devils is still
missing despite some promising signs
of late. Things will get better though
and their win against Arsenal means
they are still in the title race.
Newcastle
The Magpies have lived up to their
longstanding reputation for inconsist-
ency and Alan Pardew has been under
pressure despite Newcastle sitting
pretty in the top half. They will do well
to stay there.
Norwich
Chris Hughton looked a dead man
walking at half time against West Ham
but the Canaries ﬁnally turned on
the style in the second half. The con-
ﬁdence boost of winning before the
international break could kick-start
their season.

Imperial Duathletes win in Hillingdon
Imperial romp
home again
David Neilsen-Scott gives his account.
A
scrappy game of
rugby looked to be
the order of the day
as Imperial 1st XV
welcomed bottom of
the table Kent to a wet Harlington
sports ground. Coming oﬀ the back of
successive 24-0 victories conﬁdence
was high in the home dressing room.
With fresher Masters student Tom
‘the mole’ Catchpole having done
the dirty on his old team, IC felt they
knew the strengths and weaknesses of
their opponents.
Kent kicked oﬀ playing with the
wind behind them. Immediate
handling errors from Imperial and
a good line break from the outside-
centre allowed Kent an early visit
into the home 22. The sloppy start to
the game continued as Imperial were
penalised at the ruck, giving the Kent
captain (Catchpole: “he’s an incredible
player”) an easy chance in front of the
posts. Imperial held their collective
breath, as the end of their 160 minutes
of unbroken defence seemed nigh.
The kick ﬂew wide.
Encouraged by this sign, IC grew
into the game and worked up the
pitch through the forwards, with
powerful carries from O’Connell,
Hardisty and Nielsen-Vinegar-Scott.
Under pressure, it was the turn of
Kent to infringe and James Cox made
no mistake with his kick at goal to put
IC 3-0 up.
As the half progressed there were
an increasing number of dropped
balls. The scrum count rose and props
Jon Lineham and Tom ‘momentum
fresher’ Shuz stepped into the
spotlight. Aided by the lithe, otter-
like frame of Tom Hobson at hooker,
the Imperial front row “manshamed”
their rural counterparts. The resultant
penalties allowed IC to gain good
ﬁeld position via the boot of Cox. The
forwards battered towards the line
drawing in more and more of the Kent
defenders to repel the barrage, and
when the ball went wide Catchmole
was in acres of space to touch the
ball down into the corner. Cox was
predictably baﬄed by the faint breeze
leaving the score 8-0.
Imperial stayed on top for the rest
of the ﬁrst half. A good kicking game
from scrum- and ﬂy-half, assisted by
breaks from centres Jack Flanagan
and Jon Mann and some gangly yet
eﬀective counter-attacks from full
back Josh O’Donnell ensured IC were
dominant. The proof came as skipper
Mike O’Connell converted pressure
Southampton
The season’s surprise package so
far, Mauricio Pochettino is looking an
inspired appointment and although
Saints’ fabulous run will doubtless end
eventually, they can set their sights on
playing in Europe next term.
Stoke
The Potters have not won since
August and ﬁnd themselves looking
nervously down the table. They scored
3 against Swansea but have otherwise
looked toothless in attack and over
the winter months it is absolutely vital
they get some wins under their belt.
Sunderland
Gus Poyet has his work cut out at
the Stadium of Light. They are in a
relegation scrap and their season now
is all about the ﬁght for survival. That
said, a Tyne-Wear derby win and vic-
tory against Man City will do their
conﬁdence no harm.
Swansea
Many tipsters saw Swansea qualify-
ing for the Europa League via a top
six ﬁnish this season, but that looks
a distant hope. The strains of playing
Thursday-Sunday are taking their toll
but the Swans are still a good side and
should ﬁnish mid-table.
Tottenham
Andre Villas-Boas has faced a lot
of criticism from fans despite a solid
start. The promise of entertaining
football that came with Spurs’ sizeable
summer outlay has not materialised.
The Champions League might be a
bridge too far.
West Brom
Steve Clarke’s side continue to look
organised defensively but his summer
signings have added a new attacking
dimension to the Baggies as well. They
can realistically expect to ﬁnish in the
top half.
West Ham
Until Andy Carroll returns the
Hammers will continue to struggle for
goals. It feels like damage limitation
every time they play and for now the
aim has to be to stay clear of the rel-
egation zone.
into points, squeezing over in the
corner from a maul. The shock of
scoring confused the Captain, forcing
him oﬀ the pitch to recover. It was
Imperial’s International, recently
returned from representing Nigeria
in the African Cup of Nations in Ivory
Coast, Olisa Ufodiama who stepped
in for his long awaited return- after
a slight reshuﬄe of the pack. Proving
that they were better with the Captain
oﬀ the pitch, IC built momentum, with
Olisa crunching the Kent 15 to leave
him gasping on the ground trying to
ﬁnd his windpipe.
The half ended at 13-0 and the two
props gave way to Jake Bagby and Dave
Jones, deservedly making the team oﬀ
the back of huge performances for
the 2nd XV last week. Both carried
on where their predecessors left oﬀ,
Bagby taking a leaf from the WWE
handbook to extract both yards and
penalties from his man whilst Jones
showed great enthusiasm in the
loose. A classic IC driving maul in the
corner gifted Tom Hedley his third
try of the season with Cox slotting
the conversion to surely guarantee the
result at 20-0.
With Kent running for their white
cliﬀs, more ﬁne work in the forwards
culminated in Ufodiama breaking
through the line from 30 meters out
before oﬄoading to Hardisty. The
Club Captain put his head down and
three trampled tacklers later added
ﬁve points to Imperial’s tally.
The Imperial forces marched on;
replacement winger Jack Dunning
made his mark at the breakdown,
winning a penalty in front of the
sticks that any ﬂanker would have
been proud of. Cox put the ball over
to make it 28-0 with around ﬁve
minutes to go.
In a great display of determination
Kent rallied in the ﬁnal moments of
the game, choosing to attack from
deep. Unfortunately for the visitors
a tap penalty on their own tryline
only served to send South African
poacher Charles Price-Smith in for
an interception try, who displayed
stunning arrogance to swan dive
under the posts on debut. Cox was
successful with the conversion to give
a ﬁnal score of 35-0.
The result places Imperial at the top
of the league and now makes it over
240 minutes since a point was last
conceded.
With performances like this,
Imperial 1st XV will have an excellent
season.
