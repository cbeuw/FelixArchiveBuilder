Tibet: a brighter future than the rest of China
L
ately an article in Felix,
“What does the future hold
for Tibet” has received great
attention, calling for peace
and independence for Tibet.
While attempting to maintain a sound
argument,thisarticlesuppliedseverely
falsiﬁed evidence and subjectively
interpreted facts. A disgrace to truth,
and as such I endeavor to ﬁght against
injustice.
My dear MSc Geophysics friend,
Tibet does not encompass a quarter
of the Chinese landmass. This ‘fact’
stated by the original author derived
from the assumption that Tibet
originally comprises Qinghai province
and parts of Sichuan province, and
Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR)
has shrunk to its current size due to
the suppression of the (majority Han)
Chinese. What a hypocrite! Claiming
the land of other ethnic minorities
to be Tibetan! Hopefully the author
knew that ethnic Han were the group
of people of whom she simply referred
to as ‘Chinese’. The ethnic Mongolians
and Uyghurs are the natives of
Qinghai, whereas the mountainous
Sichuan has been sparsely populated
by any people until Qing dynasty.
Since Qing dynasty (17th century),
Tibet has always been part of China
hence it is simply out-of-nowhere
to blame the PRC government of
occupying Tibet in 1952.
While attempting to claim the
vast of Western China ought to be
Tibet, the author has stated that the
population of TAR is 13 million: 6
million of Tibetans and 7 million
of Chinese. Presumably the author
meant 7 million other Chinese; it is
simply jaw-dropping to see that at a
science and engineering university
like Imperial College London, one
supplies data with diﬀerence of
several folds from that of the oﬃcial
census of Tibet: in the last census in
2010, 3 million people resided in Tibet
Autonomous Region of China, while
90% of the population were ethnic
Tibetans. It is highly questionable why
one may use data that largely deviates
from what is scientiﬁcally evaluated
and publically published, presumably
to create ethnic tension in China.
However this is not yet the most
ridiculous part. The author stated
that “human rights have failed,
Tibet’s culture and religious practices
have been heavily oppressed
and environmental destruction
as a consequence of burgeoning
infrastructure”. Long before Tibet
became part of PRC, strict serfdom
was practiced in the autonomous
Tibet of Qing dynasty. Under the
disguise of Tibetan Buddhism, the
Tibetan society was a typical example
of a feudalistic society. The majority
of the Tibetan population were
slaves, who had little human rights
and merits of life. How dare one say
that the termination of slavery by the
PRC is a failure of human rights? This
liberation beneﬁted the majority of the
Tibetans, while the minority, indeed
one person has lost his status as whom
to be praised – the Dalai Lama. Under
the old systems of Tibet, Dalai Lama
has acted as a quasi-spiritual leader
under the disguise of religion, but the
truth is that he was a feudal emperor.
Thanks to the exile of the Dalai Lama,
the real Tibetan Buddhism can be
practiced. Furthermore, the exile
of Dalai Lama was voluntary: he
demands full control over Tibet, or he
leaves.
It is no wrong that the rest of China
provides economic support for Tibet.
If the burgeoning infrastructure in
Tibet is to be blamed; if the plans of
an airport are to be criticized; if the
new 5000-room hotel to be built in
Lhasa is to be condemned; this is
simply implying that Tibet will be
better oﬀ without them. This makes us
wonder if the author has a completely
diﬀerent conception of ‘development’
compared to that of the rest of us.
Under the governmental exchange
programmes, the school that I
attended (the best public school in
the district with the highest GDP
in Beijing) was obliged to accept
10% Tibetan students into the class.
Many of these students have travelled
outside Tibet for the ﬁrst time of their
lives and are enjoying much better
education. The Han Chinese students
never discriminate against them, as
they simply always knew that “the
ethnic minorities are also Chinese”.
The ethnic minorities, including the
Tibetans are not subject to the famous
‘One Child Policy’, in order to preserve
their own culture and customs. In the
national university entrance exam,
bonus points were awarded simply
for being an ethnic minority, due
to their disadvantaged educational
backgrounds.
Last but not least, the economic
support which the more developed
areas gave to Tibet is simply more
than one can imagine. The revenue
generated from tourism, the
opportunities of trade with the east,
the funds which Tibet receive in the
name of developmental support, are
all the beneﬁts Tibet receive simply
for being part of China. It is highly
questionable of one’s intention, if
one proposes that saving Tibet is
equivalent to being independent
from the rest of China, risking to be
returned to the society of slavery
under the previous governance of
Dalai Lama.
The answer to the original author’s
question would be that Tibet holds an
even brighter future than the rest of
China. Or maybe “Tibet holds an even
brighter future than that of what Dalai
Lama may oﬀer” might be a more
coherent answer to that questioned by
the author in the article.

here is a general feeling
in our society that guys
shouldn’t hit girls. This is
great. Girls shouldn’t hit guys
either, but on the occasions
that these rules should be bent, they
aren’t. If you haven’t guessed, I’m
talking about martial arts, where men
and women come together to train
themselves in self-defence – or attack.
As a woman who has been training
in martial arts for the best part of
eight years, with numerous classes
and sets of people, I’ve always found
it a struggle to get a guy to hit me.
Hard. This isn’t masochism; this isn’t
a cry for help. I simply want to train,
and yet I have met and seen women
suﬀer with similar frustrations. So I’m
writing to reach out to practitioners
of martial arts and hopefully set the
record straight.
Women join martial arts out of their
own free will. This means they have
most likely weighed up the chances
they might get hurt and don’t care.
It’s part of learning how to defend
yourself. Just as guys will ﬁght hard
with each other to prepare themselves
for real combat, women want to do
the same. We want to know that if the
worst happens on a night out, we are
ready to defend ourselves. We want to
know that we are used to the challenge
of dealing with force and punches that
are thrown for real. If we were to ever
be hit, we don’t want it to be a surprise
that catches us oﬀ our guard. We want
to know that we’ve been hit before;
we’ve learnt to take it, to condition, to
bounce back.
Although it may seem like the
gentlemanly thing to do, to hold back
on a strike, it is actually only doing
your partner a disservice. A class is a
controlled environment where women
and men alike want to learn to ﬁght,
and what it’s like to face an assailant.
Holding back will only weaken their
technique and leave them unprepared
for the real world.
I know instructors who have
wrongly spread this idea as well. There
is an idea that training with a women
is good, until you want to really try
the moves out. This is rubbish. Sure,
don’t beat your partner up, but don’t
base that on their gender. I hear
people complain that they’re afraid
that they’ll hurt their partner because
they’re skinny or small or delicate.
Again, rubbish. If you swapped
that woman with a man of the same
structure and physique, would those
apprehensions still apply? For most of
you, I’ll guess that the answer is no. So
act on it. If gender is the only reason
that you’re not putting your full eﬀort
into helping your partner learn how to
defend themselves, change it now.
I shouldn’t just leave this message to
the men, because I’ve seen it happen
among women too. I’ve seen women
who’ll take pleasure in giving their
male partner hell, but who seem just
as frightened to land a strike on their
female partners. Ladies, it’s a bad,
bad circle we’re creating. If we won’t
practice properly with each other, it’ll
just encourage other guys to think that
they can’t too.
So fellow martial artists of all
genders; don’t hold back on the
women in your class. Give them
the same respect and eﬀort as you
would to their male counterparts.
It’s your job, as their partner, to give
them the best practice they can - take
that role seriously. And if it still feels
uncomfortable, you can always just
ask. You might just be surprised.
