FRIDAY 15 NOV
COMMENT
T
his time last year I bought
a bike. It had taken four
years of living in the city
but I was ﬁnally living my
stereotyped London dream
of ﬂying around on two wheels,
ﬂuorescent jacket ﬂuorescing and
carbon emissions zeroing; king of the
road. The bike was freedom. Unlike
the tube, I could get exactly where I
wanted to go rather than a ten walk
away. Unlike the car I could tie the
thing to the nearest pole and get on
with it. It was blue in some parts and
another shade of blue in other parts. It
was perfect.
I was initially cautious, sticking to
journeys through parks and laughing
with unbridled joy as I left hapless
pedestrians and the occasional horse
in my wake. What chance did they
stand? The bicycle was the vehicle
of the future and I its shiny jacketed
prophet. The speed, the elegance, the
dinging bell. They were glorious days
but this was mere child’s play and I
knew it. It couldn’t be long before
I left my bipedal and quadropedal
playmates for the Big Boy world of the
London road.
If you haven’t had the experience
of being a tiny sack of squishy meat
ﬂeeing a stampeding herd of steel
wildebeest who dislike you for not
having to pay road tax then you
haven’t cycled in London. There are
few things to make you so acutely
aware of your own mortality as
passing through Trafalgar Square
at half past 5 on a weekday. The
roundabout seems to be governed by
chaos and bravery, often forcing me
to circle it a few times before escaping
to the correct exit. It’s always while
trying to change lane that you realise
your helmet is essentially an upturned
polystyrene cup with holes in it, which
doesn’t help much either.
It’s when the sun starts to set that
the real horrors kick in. No matter
how many ﬂashing LEDs I attach
to myself (I’m starting to look like a
human-shaped Tetris game), drivers
will never behave as if they are aware
of my existence, barely missing me as
they overtake. Potholes, conveniently
located at the side of the road where
the cyclists cycle, are rendered near-
invisible, leaving my backside near-
unsittable. Then if you’re out really
late, you have the joys of drunk
cyclists to look forward to, wibbling
and wobbling side to side as if the road
were one big tightrope.
It’s fair to say I had an authentic
experience of cycling in London but
my baptism wasn’t fully complete until
6 weeks into bike ownership when I
gobbled my last piece of authenticity
pie; my bike was stolen. Well, sort-of
stolen. I kept forgetting to lock the
thing up and eventually someone took
up my oﬀer of a free bike.
I was bereft. Yes, the bike was a
source of mortal peril but it had
given me a certain freedom I now had
lost. For the ﬁrst time I had started
to understand London as a city, a
coherent whole. Travelling by road I
had seen how one part related to the
other. Now, stuck on the underground,
I was conﬁned to a sub-par existence
of perfectly straight tube lines and
other people’s body odour. Here there
was less danger of death but it was all
false and artiﬁcial, like only playing
chess with your four year old brother;
yes, you’ll never lose but you’ll never
experience the challenge of a good
game, not to mention the fact that
his still developing spatial awareness
means you have to move his knights
for him.
Marx would say I was “alienated”
from my true nature. All I know is I
missed my bike and really wanted to
get a new one. I got one second hand
in the RAG bike auction for £30 which
lasted precisely ten seconds when I
realised it was meant for someone a
foot shorter than me. In the end it took
months of saving but I ﬁnally bought a
shiny cream coloured bike with white
handlebars and a white seat. It’s a bike
ﬁt for the Angel Gabriel himself and
is serving me valiantly. We’ve been
together now for 6 months and haven’t
looked back, the steaming sweat patch
on my back during morning lectures a
testimony to our bond.
My year of London cycling has been
both oﬀ-putting and on-turning, a
mixture of horror and freedom. For
all its perils, cycling really is the best
way to get to know the city and feel
part of it. If you really must walk, my
last word is for you; ask not for whom
them bell tolls, it tolls for thee. So get
oﬀ my damned cycle path.
Why you should make way for cyclists
Don’t be Agnostic About Interfaith
N
ext week is National
Interfaith Week,
established four years
ago to bring people
of diﬀerent faiths and
beliefs together and build bridges and
mutual appreciation between social
groups that may not mix on a regular
basis. While it hasn’t been ‘celebrated’
or ‘observed’ at Imperial College
(depending on one’s Interfaith views) I
think that we are foolish to pass up the
opportunity- especially when our faith
societies are as big as they are.
Let us clarify ‘Interfaith’. It is
anything that gets people of diﬀerent
beliefs to gather and encourage
dialogue and understanding. The
spirit underlying interfaith events is
not one of hostility. If your conception
of interfaith is ‘putting the other party
down’ you’re doing it wrong. That
doesn’t mean that you cannot discuss
controversial or engaging topics. You
need something to get people into that
room in the ﬁrst place. (As a few of us
have learned the hard way last year,
no-one shows up for slightly vague
interfaith ‘chats’). It doesn’t mean that
you are barred from disagreement
(people of diﬀerent beliefs will
disagree on minutiae). It entails a
commitment to genuine respect for
another’s opinion and a willingness to
connect with someone whose beliefs
are diﬀerent to yours. These eﬀorts
lead to more similarities, rather
than diﬀerences, being highlighted;
misconceptions are removed.
A non-religious colleague (met
through interfaith) told me about
how meeting a super-feminist woman
(clad in headscarf) challenged his
preconceptions about said headscarf.
We all harbour preconceptions in one
form or another. It doesn’t make us
bad people but inaction certainly does
not make us any better.
Interfaith isn’t a luxury. When
you’re living in a nation that is as
‘multicultural’ as Britain and when
immersed in the international
community of Imperial College,
having an understanding of others is
a necessity. Prejudice is borne out of
ignorance and can be remedied by
education and exposure to ‘the other.’
As an Ahmadi Muslim, a member
of a minority revivalist movement
in Islam, I know that there is no
better case study for ‘how-not-to-do-
interfaith’ than Pakistan, my ethnic
country of origin.
Ahmadi Muslims are declared non-
Muslim in the very constitution of the
nation by amendments made in the
70’s and 80’s. If I were to ‘pose’ as a
Muslim in Pakistan, through word or
deed, I could be subject to ﬁne, three
years in prison even death. Ahmadi
Muslims are by no means the only
sect to be victimised in recent years.
Shias, Christians, Hindus, Atheists
and others have suﬀered from intense
persecution and discrimination. Year
on year the holy month of ‘Muharram’
is vigil to intensiﬁed attacks on the
Shia population. Hundreds are killed
annually by militant organisations.
To make things worse, Draconian
blasphemy laws stiﬂe any semblance
of free speech and perhaps, even
more surprisingly, 75% of Pakistanis
support them (Pew). One wonders
how they would have perceived the
Prophet Muhammad when he allowed
a visiting Christian delegation to pray
in his Mosque.
The increasing persecution in
Pakistan encompasses a state-
sponsored atmosphere of mistrust, a
lack of education and an abundance
of misinformation. It underlines
the fact that, where we can do
interfaith, we must. It creates an
enabling environment to explore our
similarities and diﬀerences openly
and remove our misconceptions. It
teaches us that diﬀerences aren’t the
problem but that our reactions to
them are. The crux of ‘interfaith’ is
not the ‘faith’ bit but an open mindset
and a willingness to engage. It is
something that will go far beyond faith
and serve us well in our future lives.
The important kernel of ‘interfaith’ is
the expression of togetherness that it
broadcasts It highlights the humanity
common to us all.
