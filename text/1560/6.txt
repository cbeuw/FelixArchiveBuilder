6 FRIDAY 15 NOV
WELLBEING
CLINICS
Getting an STI test can feel a bit
intimidating or embarrassing
the first time you go but it’s
completely worth braving it.
There’s a bit of a misconception
that you should only go to an
STI clinic if you have symptoms
or if you think you’ve made a
mistake – this isn’t true. Getting
tested regularly is part of a
normal, healthy sex life. If you
have multiple partners, it’s also
the most responsible thing
you can do to protect yourself
and your partners, alongside
practicing safe sex. If you need
further convincing, a lot of STIs
can be completely symptomless
(especially for women) and, if
left untreated for long periods of
time, can lead to serious health
problems such as infertility – it
is always better to be safe than
sorry.
The Union hosts clinics run by
the Terrence Higgins Trust here
in the Union Building, so there is
no excuse why you shouldn’t get
yourself checked - appointments

between lectures.
How do I make an appointment?
Youcanwalkintothecliniconthe
day and book an appointment;
we also have appointments you
can book in advance over email.
What’s it like visiting the clinic?
When you go, you’ll be greeted
by a member of Union staff
manning the reception part
of the clinic. They’ll take your
first name and book you into a
slot. You will then be given CLa
form to fill in which will ask
you for your personal details as
well as some questions about
your sex life, such as your
sexual preference and sexual
experiences. You don’t have to
fill out any questions you aren’t
comfortable with.
When the nurse is ready, you’ll
be invited into the clinic and can
hand the form over. You’ll then
have a brief chat about some of
the answers you’ve given in the
form and any other concerns you
have and the nurse will decide
the most appropriate tests.
Most tests (e.g. chlamydia and
gonorrhoea) are done using a
urine sample, so you’ll be given
a sample pot and sent to the
nearest bathroom. After you’ve
filled it, you return it to the nurse
to label for testing and send
away.
Our clinic also offers rapid HIV
testing, this is performed by
taking a drop of blood from your
finger using a pinprick. You are
free to opt out of this test if you
would prefer. The results are
then given to you just a minute
or so later.
The rest of your results should be
with you in the next few weeks.
Who can get tested?
Anyone who drops in – students
are welcome regardless of age,
gender, sexual orientation, study
type or country of origin.

A lot of people are
too timid to look
each other in the
eyes. Be confident
to do this, it’s hot.
Nat
In my eyes there is
no such thing as a
‘friend zone’. Just a
warning to all my
male friends out
there...
Yas
Be open to
experimentation and
don’t rush sex, take
the time enjoy it and
make it last.
Marissa
Don’t do anything
that you or your
partner(s) are
uncomfortable
with – if people
can’t respect your
boundaries then they
are clearly not worth
your time.
Kieron
Don’t be an idiot – if
you’re concerned
have a test or a
check up
Joe
Don’t do this!

Communication
is key. It doesn’t
matter whether it’s
first or 100th time,
don’t be shy to give
directions.
