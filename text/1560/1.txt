Freshers suffer after Campus Services changes halls’ cleaning contract
Cleaning in halls debacle
CAPTION JOSEPH LETTS
S
ince the start of the year,
residents in College halls
have been coping with a
reduced cleaning service,
with bedrooms being
cleaned only once every four weeks
rather than once a fortnight. This is
the result of a cleaning review carried
our by College’s Campus Services
department, the department that in is
charge of Accommodation, Catering,
Conferences and Events, Sport and
the Student Hub. Over the Summer
College re-tendered their cleaning
contract, resulting in changes to the
provision of cleaning services around
College.
One of the issues faced by students
aﬀected by the changes was the
poor dissemination of information,
many students failed to understand
the change in circumstances or the
options they had available to them as a
result. This included the availability of
cleaning equipment for student use in
halls, and why the changes were made
in the ﬁrst place.
When Felix approached Campus
Services several weeks ago about the
changes to the provision of cleaning
in halls, they provided the following
response:
“College has recently reviewed its
cleaning services, as the last review
was over seven years ago. It made
some changes to ensure the cleaning
rotas address needs across the
campuses.
These include the following within
the areas of Campus Services
-Student feedback over the past few
years has suggested a need for Halls
to be cleaned on weekends, to tackle
any mess created on Friday evenings.
Saturday cleaning has now been
introduced as part of the rota changes.
-A signiﬁcant proportion of students
preferred not to be disturbed by the
fortnightly cleaning scheduled on the
previous rota. This has now changed
from fortnightly to a monthly, deeper
clean. General cleaning equipment
including vacuum cleaners will be
provided.
-Cleaning service levels are not
one of the factors considered when
calculating student rents. Campus
Services are contacting all students
resident in Halls to ensure they are
aware of the changes, and to provide
details of who to speak to if they have
any concerns
Updating the approach to cleaning
means that other facilities can also
be serviced more regularly or at more
useful points in the day. These include
Ethos, which can be used heavily in
the evenings, and the Library Café
which is often used throughout the
night by students, together with other
student facilities in Sherﬁeld.
All of the changes will be monitored
closely and kept under review, and
any students who encounter any
diﬃculties due to the new rota can
share these with their hall supervisor.
Campus Services have kept the
Union’s Deputy President (Finance
and Services) up-to-date on the
planned changes.”

the frequency of the cleaning
service, several students and sub-
