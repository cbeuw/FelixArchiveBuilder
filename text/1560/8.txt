Collisions unbound: what is the future for CERN?

T
he Collider exhibition
is moulded around the
unveiling of the dataset
conﬁrming the boson
detection earlier this year.
It begins by telling the story through
a ﬁlm starring those at CERN in
mid 2013, oﬀering the diﬀerent
perspectives of students, fellows and
researchers. One of these students
is Mingming Yang, only a graduate
in the ﬁfth year of her PhD, but who
plays one of the biggest parts in this
story.
Experiments within the Large Had-
ron Collider had been repeatedly run
C
urrently, experiments at
CERN have halted, giving
time for maintenance
work and a renovation
of its equipment to
take place. It is set to continue its
experiments in 2015, where the
energy intensity of its collisions will be
increase from 4 trillion electron-volts
to 6.5.
The excitement caused by the Higgs-
like particle discovery has seemed to
overshadow the rest of the achieve-
ments that CERN have been able to
produce. A host of theoretical parti-
cles were ﬁrst seen in collisions tested
by the LHC, which was installed in
2008. These have enabled theories to
be put to the test and have conﬁrmed
our ideas about the universe, the
Standard Model, which predicts the
interactions of fundamental particles.
The Higgs was ﬁrst announced to be
discovered earlier this year as sepa-
rate, repeatable experiments gave rise
to complementary results. So, what
direction does CERN to take its’ ex-
periments in 2015? While the experi-
ments showed that a particle was ob-
served with a mass similar to what was
predicted, there are other characteris-
tics of twhe particle – spin, parity, de-
cays – could change our understand-
ing of the Standard Model, if what we
thought was the Higgs was actually
slightly diﬀerent.
So far, the results from the diﬀerent
detectors, LHC, ATLAS, CMS, have
been consistent with what we have
predicted. If, in the pursuit of these
unanswered questions, we ﬁnd new
particles, we would have to revise our
position. More experiments could
provide evidence for the Standard
Model, or super-symmetry, or even
lead to the formulation of a new para-
digm.
Then there are those areas of physics
that we are still unable to account for.
Where does gravity ﬁt into the Stand-
ard Model? Why is there so much
more matter than anti-matter? What
about dark energy? Currently, we have
only been able to account for 5% of the
observed mass in the universe. The
rest of this is made up of dark energy
and matter – dark because we have
not been able to see it yet.
Conversely, the ALICE experiment
has been trying to replicate conditions
of the early universe. In the instant
after the big bang, there was a lot of
energy and heat about. Many diﬀerent
types of particle popped into and out
of existence before they could even in-
teract with much else. Try to recreate
these conditions understandably takes
a lot of energy, but if we were able
to ﬁnd what made up the primordial
soup of particles, we would be able
to see how the particles changed and
evolved over time, leading to where
we are today.
The Collider exhibit at the Science
Museum displays the journey under-
taken on quest for the Higgs boson.
However, rather than being the end of
a long search, we are in reality still tak-
ing the ﬁrst few steps towards greater
understanding.
for several months running up to
the discovery, but the data had sim-
ply been squirrelled away before one
complete, ﬁnal analysis. This analysis
that would either conﬁrm completely
there was a boson, or return them
back to square one. Up until June 15th,
no one had seen this ﬁnal set of data.
The revelation and analysis of this
life changing dataset was called the
unblinding. On June 15th, this un-
blinding was done by Yang, alone in
the early hours of the morning. It was
down to her, alongside a few others,
to conﬁrm if their research was about
to propel them into dizzying heights
of fame within the sci-
entiﬁc community or
simply come crashing
down around them.
In the exhibition’s
ﬁlm, an actress, who
portrays Yang as a
northerner, features
her talking about
sleeping in her oﬃce,
relentless work and
ﬁnally the triumphant
feeling when she ﬁrst
realised the data did
indeed prove the bo-
son to exist.
Later on in the ex-
hibition, in a mock
up of the CERN hall-
ways, a projection of
this actress is pacing
up and down in an
actual oﬃce, amidst
white boards covered
in scribbles, overﬂow-
ing ﬁling cabinets and
a star wars box set (on
VHS).
It is in this mock up set, her north-
ern stunt double pacing on repeat be-
ing her, that we met Yang, who ﬁrst
commented on the size of the lab. “In
reality, my oﬃce was half the size, and
I shared it with four other students.” A
charming, friendly woman, she didn’t
even reveal her role in the boson dis-
covery until much later. It seems that
graceful humility is a common thread
throughout the realm of particle phys-
ics, with Higgs himself also being de-
mure and modest in his role of the
discovery.
She took time out of her busy sched-
ule to come to the launch, but unfor-
tunately her colleagues were unable to
do the same. “They just have too much
work,” hinting that the discovery was
just the beginning of a longer, more
extensive road into the depths of par-
ticle physics.
We asked her what she thought of
Collider, and if it was true to what
happened at CERN at the time. On
her northern representative, she says
that the excitement displayed by the
actress was deﬁnitely subpar on how
she felt after unblinding the data. “I
was jumping around, but I could not
tell anyone. I was more excited then it
is shown here.”
Yang was also quick to dispel the
idea that she was sleeping under her
desk- “I did not do this, I stayed at a lo-
cal B & B for 68 Swiss franks a night!”
-although she did admit to only get-
ting about four hours sleep at a time
in the past two years.
She was also keen to stress it is not
just her role that makes the story so
exciting. “I think the play at the begin-
ning is good; part of the story are the
words I said, but I think [the unblind-
ing] is a combination of all the stories.”
Despite her own impressive role in
the unblinding, she spoke highly of
her peers, mentioning Josh Benda-
vid and Fabian Stoedi, who were also
on the hunt for the Higgs boson. She
stressed repeatedly that her colleagues
“are going to be big [in the ﬁeld] and
are amazing at their job. They are
some of the best.” During the run up
she was in constant contact with Josh
in particular, “I would call him up con-
stantly, at 2pm, 3pm, and 4pm…”
She explained that for her, the un-
blinding was the accumulation of a
whole team’s eﬀort, not just one mo-
ment of triumph, and through it they
gained a sense of community unlike
any other- “They are my colleagues,
they are teaching me, but they are
also my friends. This goal connects
us together…It is our work that we
have dedicated our entire life to, and
we have [sense of] belonging through
that. “
On her time at CERN, she said it was
“the most intensive three years, so af-
ter this I need to take a break!” I ask
her if all of this, the sleepless nights,
the small oﬃce, the lack of air condi-
tioning, the competition with ATLAS,
was a problem. It doesn’t matter, Yang
replied. She simply said, “I was happy.”
She only had time to stay in the
UK for a few days, as she is still ana-
lysing the data from 2011 and 2012.
She plans to publish her PhD thesis
using the data with the working title
of “On the observation of the decay
of the Higgs boson into 2 photons.
” An
impressive title that few other physics
PhD students can oﬀer, but one she
deserves more than anyone else.
Her team, the one she was so keen
to talk about, the one whose successes
she heralded over discussing her own,
and the team that has become her
family, made her shine with pride.
They should be proud too, not just
for their work in the boson discovery,
but to have worked alongside what I
feel soon will become another great
name in the world of particle physics
in years to come.
