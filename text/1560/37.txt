I
t’s safe to say that the ICUAFC
6th XI hasn’t had the best of
starts to the season. However,
when it comes to the cup,
league form is thrown out of the
window and we made the epic journey
to North London with conﬁdence to
play RUMS (UCL Medics) 3s.
Despite the biblical deluge in West
London, Shenley seemed to have
escaped the worst of the rain, leaving
that age-old saying: “It’s grim up
north” with little credibility. After an
impeccably kept minute’s silence for
Remembrance Day, the game kicked
oﬀ and IC were straight on the front
foot. The untested midﬁeld of Pia and
Sang worked well to retain the ball
and started to launch attacks on the
RUMS goal. It didn’t take long for the
ﬁrst chance to materialise with Fogo
being found unmarked by Frosty 5
yards out. Unfortunately thanks to
his hideous new sky blue and orange
boots, purchased in soft ground and
hard ground to single handedly “break
the Nike and Adidas duopoly”, he
managed to put the ball over the bar. It
didn’t take him long to make amends
however as again Frosty whipped
another delicious ball into the box,
which Fogo managed to squeeze into
the corner. Within ten minutes it
was 2-0. Tremendous wing play was
a running theme in the half and this
continued with Stewart cutting inside
and putting in another great cross.
Under no pressure at all the RUMS
centre back thought this was the time
to demonstrate some “experienced”
defending and nod the ball back to his
keeper, who somehow conspired to
simultaneously save it above his head
and let it through his legs into the
net. The ﬁrst half yielded one solitary
chance for RUMS, a speculative eﬀort
from 30 yards which hit the bar,
but the 6s went into half time fairly
comfortable. Inevitably the opposition
came out ﬁring after such a lacklustre
half but the back four of Raguenez,
Wood, Coney 2013 and Widdows
easily absorbed the pressure, reducing
them to pot shots from distance, the
best of which was a free kick easily
held by keeper Stillwell. Widdows then
showed strong technique by slipping
over but in the process launching into
a John Terry-esque salmon dive to
head the ball away. At this point Fogo
decided that scoring was far easier
without a goalkeeper in the way. A
Zarucki header put him through and
he rounded the keeper before slotting
home. 5 minutes later he completed
his hattrick by nutmegging the RUMS
centre back before again rounding
the keeper and rolling the ball into
the empty net. To ﬁnally rub salt into
the wounds Fogo netted his fourth,
running onto a delightful chip from
Pia to again round the keeper and
clip into the net. 5 minutes later and
the ﬁnal whistle went with so much
to savour: 4 goals for Fogo, ﬁrst win
of the season, ﬁrst clean sheet of
the season, next round of the cup,
Widdows and Coney ﬁnally moving
into positive fantasy football points
and the prospect of teaching the
ancient art of matchbox to the netball
girls later that evening.
5-0 - TOO EASY.

Immortals
win 6-0
Having beaten the Westminster
Dragons in week one of their
season, the Imperial Immortals
were looking to continue their
winning streak away from home at
the Greenwich Mariners.
Last season the Immortals put
41 points past the Mariners, but
having beaten LSBU Spartans in
their ﬁrst match of the season, the
Mariners had clearly put in a lot of
hard work in their preseason and
were not to be underestimated.
The match began with Alex
Brockhurst kicking oﬀ deep into
the Mariners’ half. The special
teams unit got to the ball quickly
and stopped the return, giving the
opposition a poor starting ﬁeld
position.
The Immortals’ defense fended
oﬀ the Mariners’ run and pass
game, which forced them to
punt on their fourth down. Rob
Wolstenholme caught the punt but
was tackled by the Mariners before
he could get up to speed.
Our oﬀense then took the
ﬁeld and began to drive on the
Mariners’ defense. Big carries from
Marcus Stead-Hall and Duncan
MacKinnon put the Immortals in
the red zone. The defense grew
wise to the run game and this was
when rookie quarterback Toby
Sinclair sprinted into the end zone
for a touchdown, his third of the
season. Having failed the point
after attempt the score stood at
6-0.
Alex Brockhurst again kicked
oﬀ; this time he kept it low, driving
it deep into the Mariners’ half. The
bouncing ball made it awkward for
the returners and once again they
failed to gain any good yardage.
The game then became scrappy,
with both sides giving away
unnecessary penalties.
The match continued with both
sides making short drives due
to the defensive eﬀorts made by
both sides. The immortals’ oﬀense
was stopped due to the talented
Mariners’ defensive line. Dexter
Valencia made key plays for the
Immortals, recovering a fumble
and catching an interception.
Having pinned the Mariners’
defense back to their goal line,
they were forced to try an all or
nothing play to take the game into
overtime. Their quarterback threw
the ball deep to a wide receiver;
luckily he was well covered by
Arjav Trivedi who intercepted the
ball.
Next week the Immortals are
back at Harlington hosting KCL
Regents in their third regular
season match.
