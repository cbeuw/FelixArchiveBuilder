£20.1 million
donation creates
Imperial’s Brevan
Howard Centre
B
revan Howard - the third
largest hedgefund in the
world, has made a historic
£20.1 million donation
towards the set up of ‘The
Brevan Howard Centre’ at Imperial
College London. The centre is set to
be “one of the most important centres
for ﬁnancial research in the world”
according to Mervyn King (former
governor of the Bank of England) and
will be based in Imperial’s renowned
business school.
Professor Franklin Allen and
Professor Douglas Gale, two of the
world’s leading experts on ﬁnancial
crisis and market contagion (The
spread of economic crisis/boom via
small ﬁnancial institutions) are set to
lead the centre, leaving their previous
posts in the US where they were based
at top universities. The professors
have been hailed as “two of the giants
of modern banking and corporate
ﬁnance.” by Kenneth Rogoﬀ, Professor
of Economics at Harvard University,
and Alan Howard, (founder of Brevan
Howard) an Imperial alumnus, as
well as the man behind the donation,
is hoping that “under Franklin and
Douglas’ leadership, the Brevan
Howard Centre will be perhaps the
world’s most important locus for
studying these [ﬁnancial] issues.”
Professor Allen himself, has said
that Brevan Howard’s donation has
“created the opportunity to set up
a ﬁnance centre that will be second
to none in the world.” And together
with Professor Gale, he plans “for
the research produced at the Brevan
Howard Centre to have a direct
and positive inﬂuence on ﬁnancial
policymakers and practitioners.”
Professor Gale also added that
“Although the Business School is
relatively young, it has made rapid
progress and I am conﬁdent that it can
attain the global stature that Imperial
College has in the natural sciences,
engineering and medicine. Thanks
to the generosity of Alan Howard in
funding the Centre, we have already
taken a big step toward that goal.”
As you may have deduced by now,
this centre will eﬀectively play a part
in determining the future of both the
US and UK economies, and therefore
it is no surprise that this initiative has
been met with praise from oﬃcials
from both sides of the Atlantic.
Former US Treasury Secretary Larry
Summers has made assurances that
it will “make our ﬁnancial system
work better and make ﬁnancial policy
much wiser”. London Mayor Boris
Johnson hardly seemed to be able to
contain his excitement, commenting
that: “Great scholars and thinkers are
intrinsically linked to the success of
our city, and having convinced these
two world leading minds to move
here will help Imperial College further
cement London’s position as the
world’s intellectual capital.” - Sounds
good to us Boris!
Therefore, not only has Imperial
once again asserted its dominance on
the world stage of leading institutions,
the college has also adopted a hands
on approach to addressing the key
issues that are confronting society
today. The success of this approach has
been exempliﬁed by the high graduate
employment rates that Imperial
produces time and time again, and the
launch of the Brevan Howard Centre
is just another step in cementing
Imperial’s global reputation.
Seedcamp is known as ‘the Harvard
of Startup Accelerators’, and widely
regarded as the top Accelerator
in Europe. On top of their regular
activities, they also run Seedhack a
hackathon (where coders, designers
and other startup-y types get together
and ‘hack’ cool products together
over a weekend). Last weekend was
Seedhack 4.0, with the theme of
‘remixing content’. They worked to
get a lot of data providers at the event,
and we were spoilt for choice! From
the BBC’s realtime news data hose,
through to Nokia’s music service and
lots of image providers (including
Getty, the photo source for all
newspapers), we had it covered!
The mostly Imperial team,
comprised of Ben Miles, Florian
Rathgeber, Aeneas Wiener and
Thomas Lim joined forces with
three other entrants. Our work with
Imperial Create Lab and ICSaaS
meant we have the creative and
technical skills to execute on a cool
idea. The concept of balanced news is
one which we liked; there are always
two sides to a story, but when reading
articles on the internet, it is all too
easy to get an unbalanced view.
Our hack pulled in realtime
news stories from the BBC News
Labs experimental ‘Juicer’ API. We
analysed the content with sentiment
analysis to ﬁgure out which ‘side’ of
the story it was about. Articles are
augmented with various associations
to people, places, oganisations, events
etc., which we used to query for
related articles. With more sentiment
analysis, we could work out the article
with views most diﬀerent to the
ﬁrst one analysed. At this point, we
analysed any Tweets which had been
shared with the URL to the article
in it. We measured the sentiment
(both for positivity or negativity, and
strength of view) of all tweets, and
the aggregate scores were factored
in to how we displayed articles on
the page. We named it Oppozeit, as
we combined the zeitgeist nature of
many news aggregation tools, whilst
showing the opposing sides of an
argument.
Articles were rendered side by
side (the two ‘opposing’ articles in
question), with the proportion of the
page given to each one being based
on which articles were getting the
most vocal support on Twitter. The
background colour was based on how
strong opinion and language was in
the article itself, with a darker shade
indicating strong language. The image
backdrop was pulled from Getty, with
the articles ‘key words’ (also provided
by the BBC ‘Juicer’ service) being
provided as search terms.
All in all, we felt it was an impressive
hack considering the time frame!
We were delighted that Seedcamp
decided to announce us as winners of
Seedhack 4.0! Some hackathons have
impressive prizes– over £1000 in cash,
a trip to the US are some we’ve come
across (but sadly not won) recently.
Seedhack tops it all though– a Star
Trek Enterprise Pizza cutter. The
Enterprise does of course represent
the cutting edge of Innovation, so what
better way to cut pizza at hackathons
and when working at a startup? We
look forward to our next Hackathon,
but in the mean time check out our
live demo: oppozeit.me and stay
tuned as we develop our hack!

wardens have raised a possible legal
issue surrounding the changes. The
frequency of the cleaning service is
one of the terms and conditions of
the Accommodation License that
all halls’ residents have to agree to
before they can accept an oﬀer of
accommodation. As mentioned in at
the start of this year’s contract, College
Accommodation Licence (2013
-2014), the licence contains legally
binding obligations that apply to
students. However, this year’s licence
still states in Section 4 (Cleaning)
that “At all accommodation with
the exception of Xenia all kitchen,
reception and other communal areas
will be cleaned daily, Monday to
Friday, and study bedrooms will be
cleaned fortnightly...”
The disparity between the contract
signed by every student in College
accommodation and the cleaning
services provided by College has
caused some concern in the halls’
population. Several halls’ residents
have sent in complaints to Campus
Services regarding what they consider
to be a breach in contract, to which the
department replied, “…We do reserve
the right to vary the frequencies in
order to avoid having to increase our
running (and therefore rental) costs.”
However, this does conﬂict with the
initial response we received from
Campus Services (see above) where
they state that cleaning service levels
are not considered when calculating
student rents. Felix looks forward to
their clariﬁcation on this issue.
Last year’s Union President and
current sub-warden Paul Beaumont
sent a letter of complaint (in a personal
capacity) to the Rector, Provost,
College Secretary, and Associate
Provost (Institutional Aﬀairs) this
week, in which he stated, “Although
the licence reserves eight other
rights to vary the contract, altering
the frequency of cleaning is not one.
An organisation cannot (or should
not – even if it reserves the right to)
vary a contract except under extreme
circumstances. ‘Re-tendering’ and
altering the provision to save money
(but not passing on this saving to the
customer) is not, in my or in any of
the residents I’ve spoken to views, an
extreme circumstance.”
Felix has asked Campus Services
to respond to a few questions, asking
to have more information about
the feedback process they used to
solicit student feedback, as well as
the number of the respondents who
preferred monthly cleaning. We’re
also hoping to be told more about the
decision process and how they plan to
operate for the rest of the year.
However, we are aware that Campus
Services will be reviewing the cleaning
provision in the near future, especially
for areas where the level of cleaning in
inadequate, with a view to increasing
the level of cleaning in these areas
(i.e. kitchens used by large numbers
of students). We have also heard that
they have provided some cleaning
materials for students to use and we
look forward to further developments.
