CAREERS
Apply yourself
T
he autumn term is a very
busy time. There is the
new academic year to
contend with and for many
of you, it is also time to
considering your options. Options for
how to spend your summer gaining
valuable work related experience,
carrying out an internship, options
on course related placements and for
the ﬁnalists among you, options on
where your career will take you after
you have ﬁnished those ﬁnals and the
celebrations have subsided.
In a previous article we have
discussed what to consider if you are
intending to apply for further study
so this week we will focus on the
application process for the world of
work and give you some pointers to
help you succeed.
Firstly it is important to be aware
of the tight deadlines that are in place
for the vast majority of the larger
opportunity providers. There is a set
cycle of recruitment that exists and
you need to be aware of key dates and
milestones. If you miss crucial closing
dates now you may be putting yourself
out of the race for the current round of
recruitment for this year. These dates
are important for both graduate roles
as well as summer internships.
Broadly speaking recruitment
for opportunities, whether they are
placements, internships or graduate
roles are open now and a few
have already closed. On the whole
applications open early in the autumn
term and close as we move toward the
end of November and into December.
There are of course exceptions and
what organisation A does in terms
of recruitment may not be exactly
the same as organisation B. Seeking
out opportunities is obviously very
important but you should also ensure
that you take ownership of the process
and are aware of the deadlines. If you
are considering options with a small to
medium enterprise (SME) these may
have an ‘as required’ policy and may
not follow the same cycle as larger
organisations. We wrote about these
types of organisations in last week’s
Felix and you should not discount
SMEs as part of your job hunting
strategy.
No matter what size of organisation
and in whatever sector you will still
need to apply. The application stage
is the most critical of the process
and this is where the vast majority
of applicants fall down. Time spent
at this stage of the process is time
well spent as once you are shortlisted
and move through to interviews and
assessment centres your chances
of success increase. At the initial
application stage there will be many
more applicants for the numbers of
vacancies that exist and employers will
use the application stage to quickly
sift out the candidates that they do
not wish to pursue. Whether your
application consists of a CV and cover
letter or online application questions
you should adhere to the following
principles to maximise your chances
of success.
1 Think like an employer.
Recruitment is an expensive process
and employers want to ensure they
select the best candidates for the
advertised role. Before you start
applying you should carefully read
the job advert and description and
accompanying person speciﬁcation
if there is one. The Person Spec.
outlines the skills and attributes that
the employer has in mind for the
ideal person for the role, itemised and
presented in paper. Make sure that
you meet all the essential criteria and
education required for the role. If you
don’t, you will be sifted out at the ﬁrst
hurdle. You should also read all the
other information in the advert fully.
There can be subtle hints about the
type of person that they are looking
for. Do they mention working away
from home? This could indicate they
need ﬂexibility. Do they mention that
they require pro-active people? This
could indicate they need a person
with a ‘can do’ approach who seeks
solutions when required. These are
just a couple of examples however. If
you go back and re read the vacancies
you are interested in have you actually
started to gain a clear picture in your
mind of the person required? You may
want to jot down these key points
after deconstructing an advert and
use them as a point of reference as you
craft a strong application.
2 If the application is on line – do
not start ﬁlling in your responses
in one sitting and hit send. Good
applications take time and will require
more than one draft as you review
your responses constantly checking
back to the actual advert and any
other information you have gained
from research that you have carried
out into the organisation. It is good
practice to download the application
or complete your responses in a
Word document so you can write a
solid answer. You should also keep
copies of your application form and
the responses that you sent as these
will likely be referred to again in the
interview process. It’s a good idea to
re-read everything that you wrote
in application before attending an
interview.
3 If you are completing a large
number of applications do not be
tempted to cut and paste answers
from other forms. Questions may be
similar but won’t be exactly the same.
For each application you should be
tailoring your application for that
organisation. The reader should think
that you only have eyes for them.
Remember they know the type of
person they want – it’s in their person
speciﬁcation.
4 When you are using examples of
your suitability try to use examples
form diﬀerent areas of your life.
College, leisure, previous work
experience and so on. It makes the
form far more interesting to the reader
who may have read lots of applications
during the course of the day.
5 Get the basics right. Employers
will not be impressed with poor
spelling and grammar. Ensure you
have proof read your application or
CV before sending.
6 Evidence is the key. Employers are
looking for certain skills which you will
have noted from your detailed analysis
of the actual role you are applying for.
A good way to present your evidence
is by using the STAR technique:
S – Situation = set the scene –
describe the situation?
T – Task = what was your role?
A – Action = what did you do and
how did you do it?
R – Result = what was the outcome?
Ensure that you write so that it
all hangs together to paint a picture
of the kind of person you are, what
your strengths are and what you like
doing. You should also ensure you are
answering the question asked and link
your answer back to the key skills the
employer is looking for. Remember
to phrase your answers to show what
you have contributed or done so avoid
over use of ‘we’ in your descriptions
of activities. Employers often look
for evidence of your personal impact
so make sure when describing a
situation you remember to ﬁnish with
the outcomes or beneﬁts from your
actions.
7 Become the recruiter. Once
you have completed your questions
or tailored your CV ask yourself
honestly, “Would I shortlist me?”
based on the evidence provided. If you
feel that you have not demonstrated,
with evidence, that you are the person
they are looking for then you will need
to rethink your responses or further
review your CV
This has been a short overview
and has hopefully got you thinking
positively about your applications. The
Careers Service has a whole range of
information and resources to help you
with this crucial phase of the process.
