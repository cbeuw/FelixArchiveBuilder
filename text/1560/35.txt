PISCES
This week you try and sneak
into h-bar as an undergraduate
for lunch. Everything’s going
great until you try and order an
alcoholic drink with your meal.
Hurling insults at the bar staff
for the lack of such drinks re-
sults in you being banned from
all bars on campus.
This week you decide to run
your own personal SHAG
week at home. It would be a
lot better if you had a partner
and didn’t consist solely of
copious amounts of online
porn but it’s still the most
romantic encounter you’ve
had since your next door
neighbour looked at you last
year.
This week you order a
fleshlightonline,unfortunately
the discreet packaging when
it’s accidently sent to your
home home and your mother
opens the package for you.
She sends it to you but can
never look you in the eye
again. Your dad just asks for
the website.
This week you resolve to try
and use a dental dam with
your girlfriend, and to try out
your latest roleplay idea. She
doesn’t find dentists sexy, and
runs away when you get out
the fake drill you made. While
running she falls and chips a
tooth and you end the night in
a real dentist’s surgery feeling
guiltily turned on.
This week you complain to
your lecturer that he’s been
teaching the course too fast
and that you can’t follow any
of his lectures. It turns out that
there was an extra lecture ev-
ery week that you didn’t know
about. Accepting the inevita-
bility of a 2:2 you head straight
to the nearest pub.
This week the pile of mold
that’s built up in your room
achieves sentience. You de-
cide to call it Steven and talk to
it every night. It’s the most nor-
mal conversation you’ve had
since you came here. After 4
weeks the hall cleaners finally
come and murder Steven.
This week your parents get
Snapchat. At first all they do
is send you pictures to remind
you of home, however your
dad forgets to unselect you
when sending private ones
later. You’re not sure who Mrs.
Jenkins is but you’ve now seen
more of your father than you
ever wanted.
This week you realize you’ve
forgotten to apply for any jobs
or internships. You hastily send
off as many applications as you
can before you notice you’ve
attached your best friend’s CV
they sent you to look at for them.
Every company phones you
back offering them a job.
This week you try and orga-
nize a support protest at Im-
perial against the dissolution
of ULU. You hand a petition
around your lecture hall but
all the responses are insults
against the other London uni-
versities. At least your protest
is legal and you don’t end up
at Holborn police station.
This week you develop a the-
ory that disproves the entire
textbook your lecture course is
based on. You excitedly inform
your professor, but far from be-
ing impressed he sabotages
all your evidence. Lecturing to
undergraduates is apparently
far easier than rewriting his
book.
This week you decide to
complain about the quality of
the horoscopes, but put it off
because you have too much
coursework. Unfortunately you
don’t notice the parallels in the
situations so send an angry
email next month. Douche.
This week while particularly
lonely you decide to download
Tinder, but you can’t quite re-
member the name of it and ac-
cidently install Grindr instead.
While it’s not quite the same
your popularity on it is a wel-
come ego boost, and you ar-
range coffee with Gavin next
Monday.

Gareth Willaims,
who died in
suspicious
circumstances
and was also
member of MI6
(a suspicious
organisation), died
accidentally say
Met.
Suspicious
Death Of MI6
Agent
“Probably An
Accident”
BREAK SPENT
TORTURING
BISCUITS
Soldier Convicted Of
Killing
T
he suspicious death of an
MI6 agent three years ago
has been declared by the
Metropolitan Police to
be “totally normal” and
“probably an accident”.
An inquest in 2010 found that the
death of Gareth Williams, who was
found naked in a padlocked sports
bag, found that this was “all a bit ﬁshy”,
However, the Met conﬁrmed that
these suspicious set of circumstances
were, in fact, completely within the
ordinary.
“People are found everyday to have
killed themselves through bag-based
means” “the fact that we have been
unable to determine a cause of death
is also pretty standard”.
Hired Killer Killed Wrongly
A
British soldier was
this week convicted of
killing an Afghani in
a way in which he was
not employed to do so.
Whilst, as a soldier, he was employed
by the British government to kill, the
prosecution argued that he had most
deﬁnitely killed in a “grossly wrong
way”.
The military court conﬁrmed that
whilst “this was the type of Afghani
Marine A was engaged to kill, the fact
that he killed him after having almost
killed him is unacceptable”.
“For sure, if he had killed this insurgent
with his original shot, we wouldn’t be
having this trial”.
“Essentially, we’re imprisoning him
because he wasn’t a good enough
soldier. Which we think we are well
within our rights to do” continued the
prosecution, - the military.
“This deﬁnitely isn’t another damming
indictment of the state of our military
training in which we fail to teach our
troops the value of the moral high
ground, especially in a contentious
war like Afghanistan”
At press time, the Royal Marines were
said to have sent out a memo telling
its troops to remember to only kill
insurgents in the right way.
This soldier reminds a subordinate
not to kill at the wrong time or in the
wrong way.
