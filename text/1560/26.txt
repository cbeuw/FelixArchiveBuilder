After a super successful Xbox 360,
which most people claim won
the last console generation wars,
Microsoft is now releasing the next
iteration into a less clear cut market.
The hardcore gaming sector as such
is being threatened by smartphone
and tablet dominated casual games.
This situation is now reflected by
Microsofts approach with the One.
Instead of just focusing on just
gaming the redmond based company
has packed the One with tons of
features to bring in new customers
that wouldn’t usually buy a console.
However this decision has lead
to an extreme backlash from the
core consumers that Microsoft
needs for this console to really
succeed. Their fail at the E3 really
dampened a lot of excitement that
had been surrounding the console
pre-announcement. They decided to
focus on the TV and media aspects
of the “gaming console” at a Gaming
convention which a lot of gamers
found worrying. Furthermore this,
coupled with the decision that a
permanent online connection was
needed to play, as well as inhibiting
the resale and loaning out of games
that seemed to have knocked the nails
into this once promising console.
Xbox, One for you?
Sony has been releasing top notch
consoles for almost 2 decades now,
and therefore the PS4 has a lot
riding on its shoulders. While the
PS3 was a great console, somehow
it just wasn’t the best that we
expected of Sony. Enter the PS4.
Almost 5 years in the making, this
console just like the Xbox One has
been surrounded by quite a lot of
hype. However in stark contrast to
Microsofts E3 announcement, Sony
thrived during their announcement
and were said to have “won” at that
convention. Furthermore Sony
has used all the negative publicity
that their rival incurred to further
their own cause. Quite an amusing
“advert” as well as gleeful jibes by
Sony executives has seen Sony’s
stock rise, and their reputation as
the defenders of hard core gaming
has been cemented. This has lead
to optimism about the potential
of the upcoming PlayStation.
However this “defence” is not
just based on what Xbox has done
(or decided not to do), but is also
backed up by the stats of the PS4.
With quite impressive graphics
as well as very respectable RAM,
this console should play games
very nicely. Furthermore the price
is very attractive. Significantly
cheaper than the Xbox One (and
in fact even the PS3), this product
has gotten itself in a great position
to win this round of console battles.
Furthermore, while the Xbox One
could only run COD: Ghosts at 720p,
the PS4 has the got the full 1080p.
This is really good news for Sony, as
gamers value graphics as one of the
top things of their gaming experience
And yet for all the promised
technologies and low price, the lack
of a knockout console exclusive is
a bit worrying. With the delay of
Watchdogs by Activision, there is
no real great game there that many
people say they need to have on a
console. While you are willing to
save £80 on the console, and can get
most of the games that the Xbox etc.,
is that enough to compensate for
watching in envy when your friend
canboastabouthiskillstreakonhalo?
So now the question for the Sony
console: Should you go for the
PlayStation 4? If you are impressed
by good graphics, smooth gameplay
and free sharing (up to publishers)
then I would go for the PS4. The
smaller price tag is also another
reason to go for the PS4! However
in the end the choice is up to you,
are you more gamer, less flexible but
with more power and technology
or do you wan to habe a bit of
everything? It’s your choice afterall.
Yet Microsoft was not ready
to concede defeat to Sony so
easily. They reversed (at least
somewhat) on most of their negative
decisions (which also caused some
uproar on the internets forum
strangely enough). However this
is probably what has still kept the
One in the running to still take
this generation’s console crown.
Now we are right just before the
release of the Xbox One, and things
are looking up from just a few
months ago. The negative details of
the E3 announcement and following
dithering of Microsoft have been
forgotten and the positives have
stayed in mind. There is just one
stumbling block that new Xbox
needs to overcome: the price. Over
£420 is quite a bit more than the
earlier generation and given that
competitors have given their devices
quite a bit cheaper price tag, this
may make gamers think twice about
forking out that kind of money.
Yet compared to the PS4 and
Wii U, the One has a strong line
up of exclusives which may yet
sway the hardcore gamers. Titles
such as Titanfall and Dead Rising
3 will grace the shelves at launch.
One last worrying caveat, Call of
Duty: Ghosts, one of the big name
games, does not run at full HD on
the Xbox One. Apparently this is
due to the fact that even though the
One does support 1080p, Infinity
Ward (the publishers) have decided
for stabilities sake that 720p is
all they could offer on the One.
What does this mean for smaller
titles? Will the full HD experience
ever come to the new Xbox?
Now the question: Should you go
for the Xbox One? If you (or your
parents) have some money to burn,
and are unsure, you should consider
the Xbox. It has very decent specs and
the opening line up of games is very
respectable. Just keep in mind that this
console is not solely aimed at gamers
and therefore will not be as perfectly
tailored to gaming as other consoles
may be. Furthermore the need to be
online once every 24 hours, as well as
lack of open resale is very annoying,
and so should be kept in mind.
However you also get several positives
which allow this device to be used for
several other purposes (movies, tv,
media etc.) which a traditional console
may not be. In the end it is your choice
though, and you have to do decide
whether you value a multifunctional
console or a gaming console more.
PlayStation 4 you?
