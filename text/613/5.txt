I must apologise to those of you
who were interested in the Ireland
trip as we unfortunately couldn't
drum up enough support to make
it v i a b l e . H o w e v e r , o n after-
thought this trip may have been
slightly a m b i t i o u s for o u r first
year. Next year will be a different
story when we have: union funds
and a larger membership, which is
why it is essential for anybody who
is at all interested in fishing to
come to our A G M today (Friday)
to elect next year's executive who
will control the use of union funds.
T h e m e e t i n g is at 12:30pm in
R o o m G08 in the Bone Building,
Chemical Engineering and coffee
and b i s c u i t s will be p r o v i d e d .

Audio
Speakers come and go but none
have come and gone as well as the
old Q U A D E S L (so well in fact
that it hasn't gone yet!).
In the wake of such an out-
standing piece of theory put into
practice came another speaker
from Q U A D which should make a
bigger spalsh than even the first.
Assigned point source proper-
ties, the ESL-63 does what the old
Q U A D E S L used to do but much
better.
All this introduction for some-
thing which I am sure needs no
introducing. Q U A D , the company,
are coming to Imperial College on
Tuesday, M a y 11. They will be
d e m o n s t r a t i n g a n d e x p l a i n i n g
their hi-fi s y s t e m : the Q U A D
44/405/FM4/ESL-63s.
This will be done at 6:30pm in
the Quiet R o o m , QR002, Sherfield
Building on Tuesday, M a y 11.
For an entertaining, educational
and mainly enjoyable lecture, I
strongly advise you to be there.

s o u n d s i m i l a r to D r I s h a m ' s
fascinating lecture on 'Quantum
Gravity' last term, the viewpoint
expressed promises to be very

Transcendental Meditation
Premenstrual tension?
Premature ejaculation?
Having trouble settling down to study, do you make excuses to
yourself to put off the work that you know you inevitably have to
get down to?
No? Well, would you simply like to enjoy your life more?
Transcendental Meditation is an easy and totally effortless mental
technique practised twice a day for about 20 minutes just sitting down
comfortably with the eyes closed. This technique allows the mind to
automatically settle down to quieter and more refined levels. The mind
remains very alert and yet the degree of rest obtained is far greater than
that at any point in deep sleep (see Scientific American, Feb 1972 or The
Lancet, April 1970).
It is this profound restful state which brings about great benefits in daily
activity. The actual experience of meditating is extremely pleasant but
the whole purpose of practising T M is to enjoy the results. People who
practise T M find that they have much" more energy, that their thinking
becomes clearer, that any worries or anxieties gradually fade away. A
sense of inner wellbeing and calmness is brought about leading to more
effective a n d d y n a m i c activity in daily life. T h e results are very
spontaneous and accumulate with regular practice.
T M is not a cult or a kind of belief-system, it is simply a mental
technique that anyone can practise and it works! So if you would like to
find out more there will be introductory talks on Tuesday a n d Thursday,
May 11 and 13 at 1:00pm in Huxley R m 341.

Dancing
Each year, Imperial College Dancing Club sends a number of its more
talented and committed members (after all, you've got to be able to
practise for an hour every day) for professional tuition with Eric
Donaldson in East Putney. There, they learn the ropes of competition
dancing, and it is to Eric's credit that he invariably produces a well-turned
out team from often raw recruits.
Dancing Club at Bristol
Friday, February 5, saw what has now turned out to be an annual
event—the Southern Universities Ball, hosted by Bristol University.
This event is usually held a few weeks before the Inter-Varsity Dancing
Competition, and provides an invaluable opportunity for the team to get
used to dancing in front of hundreds of people, as well as giving them a
chance to eye up some of the opposition for the National. Competition.
The object of the evening was to provide plenty of dancing and
entertainment for dancers of all standards to enjoy, so as well as the team
events, there was plenty of general dancing (to a live band) a n d
competitions for people who had only just started dancing, as well as for
those who were more experienced.
The 'Off Beat' section, although depleted comapred with the Inter-
Varsity Competition (because many teams, IC included, wish their 'Off
Beat' entry to be a surprise at the national competition) had two very
igood entries from O x f o r d and Bristol, and was narrowly won by O x f o r d
I with a gangsterland play.
Later we were entertained by a
L a t i n - A m e r i c a n d e m o n s t r a t i o n
couple, the Dobinsons.
'In the r e l a x e d a t m o s p h e r e at
i B r i s t o l o u r q u i c k s t e p c o u p l e ,
jVicky Welsh and Alan Logan,

Cooper and Simon Carter in the
W a l t z , a n d a f u r t h e r f o u r t h
position from Sally Barton and
Richard Williams in the cha-cha.
Rebecca M a y and Alan Edwards
I were unfortunate not to be placed
in the jive. Overall, Imperial came
fourth.
