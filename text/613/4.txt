Anti anti-apartheid
by N. Willson
" O h G o d , not another one of those self-
righteous anti-apartheid pratts" is probably the
t y p i c a l r e a c t i o n of a n I C s t u d e n t w h e n
s o m e o n e a s k s h i m to t h i n k about S o u t h
Africa.
Most students here would agree that it's
wrong for a minority to assume control over a
majority. Practically no one would support the
use of machine guns and secret police to keep
the minority in control. Y e t the c o m m o n
reaction to any protest over apartheid is one of
sneering and ridicule. O n the face of it there
doesn't seem to be any reason why people's
reaction should be like that. There are some
students here who are sympathetic towards
apartheid, but there aren't many of them and
• they usually don't have the guts to say so in
p u b l i c . M o s t s t u d e n t s are just n o t that
bothered, they're not really pro-apartheid but
anti anti-apartheid. This is a great pity because
South Africa is one of those issues where
public opinion really counts, and you could
hardly imagine a more straightforward case of
an injustice that ought to be put right. But the
fact is that the anti-apartheid cause has got
itself a bad image, and it's largely its own fault.
The Anti-Apartheid G r o u p here is unpopular
partly for the same reason that the Salvation
A r m y was (and still is) u n p o p u l a r . T h e i r
a p p r o a c h s u g g e s t s t h a t u n l e s s y o u are
c o n s t a n t l y d e e p l y c o n c e r n e d a b o u t the
injustices they draw attention to then you are
somehow inferior and ought to be ashamed of
yourself. It's an unfair picture but it is the
impression that the apathetic masses of IC
tend to have, and it doesn't make them well
disposed towards the Anti-Apartheid Group.
A n d the Anti-Apartheid G r o u p is bound to
be disliked because it's a political organisation
and therefore tainted with dishonesty. A t a
r e c e n t m e e t i n g of t h e g r o u p s o m e o n e
s u g g e s t e d , p e r f e c t l y s e r i o u s l y , that the
members should distribute themselves around
the audience in the next U G M so that they
could ask sympathetic questions about the
anti-apartheid resolution, to make it look as
though ordinary students are interested in the
motion. A n y organisation with people like that
in it is going to be looked down on.
A n o t h e r r e a s o n w h y a n t i - a p a r t h e i d is
unpopular is that it's so fashionable (except at
places like IC or Sandhurst). Nobody is going
to get into trouble for attacking apartheid and
people sense that a lot of the protests' against
apartheid are made only or largely because it's
the 'thing to do'. A n d it's likely that many
people involve themselves in anti-apartheid
because it makes them feel virtuous (the same
probably applies to I C C A G , blood doning and
so on). Because of this, most of the leaflets and
booklets produced by anti-apartheid organisa-
t i o n s h a v e a n a t m o s p h e r e of a r t i f i c i a l
indignation about them. The style they're
written in wouldn't be used by anyone who
wanted to get uncommitted people on his side.
Phrases like 'a crime against humanity' or 'the
i n t e r n a t i o n a l c o m m u n i t y must d e n o u n c e '
aren't written to sway public opinion but
because they sound solemn and imposing. The
aim of a lot of anti-South Africa protestors
seems to be a desire to present themselves as
fearless, altruistic fighters for People's Rights
because if expected of them by their party or
f a c t i o n . O r , e s p e c i a l l y w h e r e f o r e i g n
governments are concerned, they might want
to distract attention from their own practices.
S o a n e n o r m o u s a m o u n t of h y p r o c r i s y
surrounds the anti-apartheid movement, and a
lot of anti-apartheid statements (and books,
f i l m s , a r t i c l e s , t e l e v i s i o n p r o g r a m m e s ,
interviews, press releases, U N resolutions)
have a synthetic air about them, they give the
impression of being manufactured by putting
together a list of the approved slogans in some
new permutation.
But the attacks on apartheid aren't always
just propaganda. U N Soc recently gave away
some anti-apartheid literature when they were
showing a film about South Africa and among
the rubbish there was a book called 'Apartheid
in P r a c t i c e ' , p u b l i s h e d by the U N . It's a
compilation of apartheid regulations and laws
t r a n s l a t e d into simple language by Leslie
Rubin, who is (or was in 1976) an American
professor of law. It gives a m u c h clearer
picture of South Africa's race laws than you'll
get from most anti-apartheid literature, and it
shows how far the authorities have gone to
m a k e a b o u t 8 0 % of t h e p o p u l a t i o n a
submerged class. " A n African living in a town
who conducts a class in reading and writing
without remuneration in his own home for a
few of his African friends is guilty of a criminal
offence..." (Bantu Education Act, 1953).
" A n African factory worker who is absent
from work for 24 hours without permission...is
guilty of a criminal offence..." (Bantu Labour
Act, 1964).
" A n African may not, even as a personal
favour and without receiving payment, repair a
defective electrical fitting in the living quarters
of a friend who resides on his employee's
premises as the job is classified as 'skilled'. If he
does so, he is guilty of a criminal offence "
(Bantu Building Workers Act, 1951). There are
lots of other examples in the booklet.
Apart from the anti-apartheid movement's
own shortcomings, there are several reasons
why IC students will tend not to go along with
their aims. For a start, nobody likes the word
'anti'. It seems vaguely wrong to be exclusively
against something, even if the something is
d e f i n i t e l y b a d . ( A c o m m o n r e s p o n s e to
questions about South Africa is 'What about
Iran/the USSR/Ethiopia/India/Poland etc?'
But the people who say that never seem to
protest about those countries either.) More
i m p o r t a n t is the general t e n d e n c y a m o n g
s t u d e n t s t o w a r d s c y n i c i s m , not b e c a u s e
students have thought carefully and decided
that e v e r y t h i n g deserves to be r e g a r d e d
cynically, but because it's fashionable. So
students tend to be mildly embarrassed by
words like 'justice' or 'freedom' and causes like
anti-apartheid consequently suffer.
T h e main r e a s o n why people won't do
anytHing about apartheid (such as voting for
U G M motions) is b e c a u s e they can't be
bothered—and after all it's too much to expect
p e o p l e to be c o n s t a n t l y in a s t e w o v e r
apartheid or anything else. But this is an issue
where things like U G M motions will do some
good and if anti-apartheid groups didn't turn
out so much trashy propaganda (and the IC
group is better than most) then they could get
something done.
