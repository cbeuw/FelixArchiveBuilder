Rot sets in on
Montpelier St
A bad case of dry rot in the
M o n t p e l i e r St. H a l l to a £16,000
bill for the I C Student Residence
account.
T h e b u i l d i n g in M o n t p e l i e r
Street was p u r c h a s e d by t h e
C o l l e g e last S e p t e m b e r after
repairs thought necessary by the
College Estates Section had been
completed. However, since the
building has been occupied, a
fairly serious outbreak of d r y rot
has lead to c r u m b l i n g walls a n d
ceilngs and some residents have
been moved to vacated rooms
while repairs are attempted.
It is not certain that the rot
was present when the b u i l d i n g
was purchased and that it was
not recognised by the Estates
section.
T h e £16,000 estimated cost of
repairs could adversely affect the
l e v e l s o f r e n t f o r t h e n e x t
a c a d e m i c y e a r i n a l l C o l l e g e
residences.

Campbell discloses secrets
B r i t a i n ' s l e a d i n g investigative j o u r n a l i s t D u n c a n C a m p b e l l (New
Statesman) spoke to the L o n d o n Student Journalist G r o u p ( L S J G ) at the
University of L o n d o n U n i o n in M a l e t Street last Tuesday.
D u n c a n is best k n o w n for exposing telephone t a p p i n g operations in
Chelsea a n d Yorkshire and the giant M I 5 computer in M a y f a i r w h i c h
has the facility to tap into personal files i n other g o v e r n m e n t
d e p a r t m e n t s ( i n c l u d i n g the I n l a n d R e v e n u e , D e p a r t m e n t of
E m p l o y m e n t and D H S S ) .
M r C a m p b e l l disliked the term 'investigative' and said he was only a
journalist w o r k i n g harder and doing his job better than most others.
H e pointed out that most of his 'leads' came from analysis of
information that is readily available a n d that clandestine meetings in
the middle of car parks with conscience-torn civil servants were
uncommon. M r C a m p b e l l felt that if a story was factually correct and
in the public interest, no libel proceedings or charges under the Official
Secrets A c t w o u l d be brought against the author or publisher.
M r C a m p b e l l then answered a number of questions, mainly on the
most successful techniques for acquiring information.
T h e L S J G is composed of people already involved in student
newspapers or who hope to start one. It was formed two years ago and
has members from colleges, universities a n d polytechnics i n the
L o n d o n area. J
