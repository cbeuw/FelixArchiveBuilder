Sweet Freedom: the struggle for women's
liberation, by Anna Coote and Beatrix
Campbell, Picador £1.95.
All militant organisations and philosophies
have more or less the same approach, and
there are several characteristics that militant
f e m i n i s m has in c o m m o n w i t h , say, the
Socialist Workers Party or the Moral Majority.
This book, which is an account of the women's
movement from the early sixties onwards, is
an example of the output from the more
uncompromising kind of feminisim, and it has
all the features y o u ' d e x p e c t of militant
literature.
The strangest thing about a lot of pressure
groups is their apparent indifference to being
unpopular, the way they seem to be willing to
become ghettoes for the people who share
their beliefs, with the rest of the human race
more or less written off as fascists, com-
munists, racists, traitors, sexists, etc., as the
case may be. Feminists are one of the groups
who appear to have adopted this attitude of 'if
y o u are not with us y o u are against us'
(although this doesn't apply so much to the
feminist group at I C , WIST). The atmosphere
of the book is one of genuine disgust and anger
at the injustices caused by the selfishness of
men. The authors describe women's griev-
ances in great detail and they're certainly
sincere, they don't hesitate to attack the
Labour Party and the trade unions when they
think it's necessary. But although all
women are considered to be the victims of
male domination, the women's groups are
described as small, conspiratorial organisa-
tions ('small groups, linked by a sense of
involvement and a common cause') forming a
kind of underground resistance movement.
They communicate by circulating 'ill typed
roneoed sheets', a sort of feminist samizdat,
and they use the usual jargon-dialect. The
b o o k is a c e s s p o o l of j a r g o n w o r d s a n d
slogans, starting with the book's subtitle and
following with a r g u m e n t s for d e s t r o y i n g
'masculinity as a social construct' through
' h i g h l y c o m p l e x p o l i t i c a l a n a l y s e s ' w i t h
'analytical approaches' and 'strategic priorities'
placed 'in the context of cultural traditions
which objectify and silence women', etc., etc.
The style and format (with sub-headings and
a list of references after each chapter) are
partly meant to make the book seem more
learned and expert but mostly they're there
because it's the conventional style and it
probably wouldn't occur to the authors to
write in any other way. Only a relatively small
number of people will like such a style; no bus
conductor or dinner lady would read this book
and it's unlikely that the authors would expect
them to. Like other militant activists, feminists
s e e m to l i k e p r e t e n d i n g that t h e y ' r e a
dedicated band of subversives, bravely
speaking out against the might of the system.
T h e b o o k d o e s n ' t try to appeal to large
numbers of people, instead it's aimed at the
feminist intelligentsia, people like A n n a Coote
and Beatrix Campbell. To appeal to them it
has to maintain the pretence that they're
struggling in the face of appalling injustice and
repression, so overstatements are common,
for example " A n intensive war is waged against
women, to degrade them as human beings, to
deny their ideas and achievements, and to
suppress their own perception of the world."
A n d since everyone likes to think that their
c l i q u e is the one t h a t c o u n t s t h e y a l s o
e x a g g e r a t e t h e i r o w n i m p o r t a n c e : " t h e
women's liberation movement is one of the
most important political developements of this
century...."
L i k e other m o v e m e n t s , s u c h as B l a c k
Consciousness or the Democratic Unionists,
the feminists have t u r n e d into a sort of
d i s t o r t e d m i r r o r i m a g e of w h a t t h e y ' r e
attacking. They refer to women's conferences
and positive action (discrimination in favour of
women and against men) without any sense of
irony. The authors, juding by the way they
write, regard men in general with contempt
a n d s o m e d i s g u s t . W o m a n a r e b e i n g
oppressed, in their view, by a huge complex
process controlled by the cynical and power
hungry half of the population, the men.
All in all there's little difference between
feminist propaganda, like this book, and that of
the K l u Klux Klan or the Animal Liberation
Front, it's only preaching to the converted.
The feminists are saying things that need to be
said but it's a pity that they s h o u l d be
represented by books like Sweet Freedom;
they won't lose their bunch-of-cranks image
until they start talking to the outside world.

Midnight's Children by Salman Rushdie,
Picador, 462 pages, £2.95.
The g i m m i c k is g i v e n a w a y i n the first
paragraph. W e learn of Saleem, welded to
history by his birth and ancestry. The
remaining two last words expand and develop.
In the tradition of the story-teller we are
guided down through three generations and
millions of litres of bloodshed as the A z i z and
Sinai families are ground between the events
that have shaped the last sixty years in India.
D o w n t h r o u g h H a r t a l a n d p a r t i t i o n riot,
language battles and war, all the way to the
emergency. Saleem's betrayal by the man he
should have been, and the betrayal of the
children of independance to the Widow and
her son from the pivot of this extraordinary
book.
While " M y presentation of the Emergency in
the guise of a six hundred and thirty five day

romantic and certainly contradicted by the
available meteorological data" it contains more
truth than the grab-for-personal-power usually
described. The castration of hope and the
subsequent feast for the Benarsi pie dogs,
describes well the uselessness of M r s Ghandi's
opponents.
Like all good stories this one has magic,
money and love to sweeten the moral. A n d
Rushdie can tell his powerful but depressing
s t o r y so as to m a k e it c o m p u l s i v e . W i t h
flowery prose and resigned humour he can
generate a sort of nostalgia for the India of
mutilated beggars, Breach Candy and casual
death that sticks with me.
If you have ten hours spare before the
exams, this is the way to fill them. Midnight's
Children is very good.

Zig-Zag by Richard Thornley, Picador
£1.95.
Picador have discovered a good writer at last.
There are three long short stories in the book,
called 'Gastarbeiter', 'Jewels' a n d 'Tourist
Attraction'. They're all written in the first
person. The first story is very good, and it's
worth getting the book for that one alone. It's
about a hitch-hiker in Germany who gets a lift
on a heavy lorry to Belgium and drives it part
of the way himself. It doesn't sound very
p r o m i s i n g but b e c a u s e of the i n t e r e s t i n g
documentary details and because it's very well
w r i t t e n , i t ' s t h e b e s t that P i c a d o r h a v e
published for years.
The story starts with the hero leaving a
G e r m a n hostel and catching an underground
t r a i n t o w a r d s the a u t o b a h n , w h e r e he
eventually gets a lift from a lorry just as it's
starting up for the day. The hero, who'seems
to be the author, is a kind of modified late
sixties figure, he drifts around Efirope carrying
a f e w b e l o n g i n g s i n a p l a s t i c b a g . A n
unexpected touch is that both the hero and
the lorry driver are ex-public schoolboys and
the lorry driver says he's proud of it. It's one of
the things that make the atmosphere slightly
different from what you'd expect, like the late
sixties a t m o s p h e r e but with m o s t of the
psychedelicness replaced by gritty realism.
The account of the lorry journey and the
conversations about long distance driving are
very convincing and interesting, but he's not
so strong on characterisation. The next two
stories depend a lot on characterisation and
they're mediocre, nowhere near as good as the
first. The second one, 'Jewels', is about life on
a F r e n c h anarchist c o m m u n e . (The story
takes place before the events of the first one,
the publishers seem to have put ''Gastarbeiter'
first as a sort of bait.) It starts well for the first
ten p a g e s o r s o b u t t h e n it b e c o m e s
preoccupied with inter-personal relationships
and since there are eight or nine characters all
much the same it's hard to remember which is
which. The third story 'Tourist Attraction' is
about an Italian merchant who sells trash to
tourists and wants to go to California and get
rich by selling cars. It's written from the point
of view of his friend who works at another
market stall. It's about as interesting to read as
the second story. But 'Gastarbeiter' is very
good, if Richard Thornley can write something
else as good as that it'll be well worth reading.
