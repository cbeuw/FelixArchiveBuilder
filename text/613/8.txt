What's On
Mike
The mysterious disappearance of the IC
Union mascot M i k e must be a total surprise to
m a n y , not least N i c k M o r t o n a n d M a r c o
Ledwold. Mike has been kept under lock and
key for so long that it seems inconceivable that
someone should just happen to swipe it on this
rare occasion of vulnerability.
The appearance of M i k e at Wednesday's
University Challenge match in Manchester
was its first outing for a long time. Former
Deputy President Barney M c C a b e was too
lazy to take it to U G M s half the time and failed
to take Mike to previous University Challenge
matches, despite a U G M motion mandating
him to do so.
Nick M o r t o n and M a r c o Ledwold knew this
very well and were obviously trying to make
amends, but once more they seem to have
bungled it. M i k e shouldn't really have been left
unattended in the U n i o n Office at all! W h y
didn't Nick or M a r c o take it back to their
rooms, for instance, where it would have been
much safer?
It s e e m s t o me t h a t s o m e o n e o n the
University Challenge coach seized on the
opportunity of stealing it for some strange
reason (after all, they were probably the only
people around at 2am) and capitalised on
the dynamic duos' unfortunate mistake.
Hard Luck!
The defeat of the University Challenge team
puts an end to a run of victories which must
have done a tremendous amount of good for
the College's reputation. Alun Griffiths, T i m
Pigden, Martin Taylor and G o r d o n Masterton
should all be congratulated for their efforts.
They played very well and have undoubtably
paved the way for more frequent participation
in University Challenge by this College.
It was very annoying to find that five people
who said they wanted to go to Manchester
didn't turn up as promised, as we only had 25
people at the studio. M a r c o turned people
away in fact, and so these five lowly creatures
should be ashamed that they didn't tell him
earlier.

Following the theft of M i k e , IC's beloved
mascot, this column is proud to be the first to
a n n o u n c e the new s e c u r i t y a r r a n g e m e n t
agreed by Council at a special meeting late last
night.
W h e n we get it back, M i k e will be held in
place by s e v e r a l p a d l o c k s . K e y s will be
distributed to the Exec and no one will hold
keys to all the locks. In fact no two or even
three E x e c members will be able to remove
Mike. Q u o r u m has been agreed as four, and so
keys will be allocated in such a way that any
four of the six Exec members will be able to
use their keys collectively to unlock Mike.
The plan works well enough on paper, but
I'm beginning to wonder if Chris Teller has
considered the finances; I for one wouldn't like
to b r e a k it to h e r t h a t s h e ' l l n e e d at
least padlocks?
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me at
the FELIX Office, please. There is a prize of E5
(donated by Mend-a-Bike) plus two tickets to
the IC Orchestra concert a week on
Wednesday and two tickets to the IC Choir
concert a week on Friday for the correct entry
randomly selected at 1:00pm on Wednesday.
Last Week's Solution
If two of them agree, they cannot both be
mathematicians, so H and F are mathema-
ticians and G is the physicist. N o w if F is pure,
his reply about it will be " H e is applied" which
could equally well be the reply of an applied
mathematician. So F is applied and must have
said ' H is a physicist' or ' H is pure' or even ' H is
a modern linguist'!
Four people got it right, Ashley Kanter,
Maths 2, is the winner.
