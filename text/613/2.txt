Dear Mark
S i n c e y o u a p p e a l e d for
l e t t e r s I t h o u g h t I w o u l d
spend a little of my valuable
time replying to your editorial
on " L i f e After M r M c C a b e " .
Barney remains my friend.
I do not u n d e r s t a n d the
workings of his m i n d but I like
him. However, he was a lazy
D P (to use your own descrip-
tion). I have no hesitation in
saying that here or in the
office since I have spent many
months telling Barney exactly
that. L a z y , inefficient, but
occasionally brilliantly inven-
tive.
T h e reason Barney has not
been appreciated i n the office
over the last few weeks is that
we h a v e a l l b e e n o v e r -
whelmed by detailed figures
a n d u n p l a c e d orders. T h e
detective work necessary to
get to the bottom of accounts,
etc., has proved rather tire-
s o m e . H o w e v e r , l a r g e l y
t h a n k s to the a c t i n g D P ,
everything is now straightened
and we probably won't feel'
quite so bad about McCabe's
mess from now on.
Y o u remind your reader-
s h i p t h a t I d e f e n d e d the
E x e c u t i v e , i n c l u d i n g M r '
M c C a b e , against a ridiculous
motion of no confidence at a
U G M last term. A l l I can say
is "Solidarity Brothers".
Finally may I say that I do
not recognise Christine Teller
as a deity, she is a bloody
nuisance at times.

Dear Sir
F r a n k M u s t G o !
T h e Falkland Islands Crisis
brings out the best in our
(resident nuncio—about 750
words of pure S D P bull. (God
bless D a v i d Owen!). O u r man
at I C , and just how long has
F r a n k been here, r a m b l e s
from the Falklands, through
S o u t h A f r i c a , into E l S a l -
vador, whips across to J a p a n
via Suez and comes back to
L o n d o n via Plymouth (Devon-
p o r t ) . W e m u s t a d m i r e
Frank's perambulatory skills.
Has he thought of writing a
book on his journey (John
Hillaby would, I am sure,
offer some guidance)?
I will of course note Frank's
remarks on defence, crime
(and we do have a lot in
Notting Hill) P S B R and the
civil service when I cast my
vote on Thursday.
(Shsh....who was that man
who mentioned housing, fares
fare and police-community
relations?).

Dear Mark
It was with disappointment
that I f o u n d F r a n k J a m e s
( F E L I X 612) attempting to
make cheap political capital
out of the Falklands crisis at a
time when national unity over
this u n f o r t u n a t e episode is
vital. Frank claims that in
endeavouring to recover the
i s l a n d s , M r s T h a t c h e r is
a i m i n g to d i v e r t a t t e n t i o n
from the government's record
at home, and somehow save
her own skin.
T h e truth is the complete
opposite of this. T h e business
could not have come at a
worse possible time for the
government, when its econo-
m i c p o l i c i e s a r e a t l a s t
beginning to bear fruit and its
electoral support climbing.
Although the vast majority of
the people a p p r o v e of the
government's handling of the
dispute now, the first British
ship that sinks in the South
Atlantic will carry much of
that support with it—probably
the chances of a Tory victory
in the next election as well.
T h e government's resolve j
to r i g h t t h e w r o n g t h e
Falklanders have suffered, by
d i p l o m a t i c means i f at a l l
p o s s i b l e , b u t b y f o r c e i f
necessary is not just about the
islands, but about the cause of
freedom everywhere in the
world. It ill-becomes Frank to
snipe at it.

Dear Sir
In F E L I X 612 there was a
'Soapbox' article by Frank
James, attacking the conser-
vative government particular-
ly over its handling of the •
F a l k l a n d d i s p u t e . F i n e , I
agree with him so far. But at
the end there was a call for us
to vote for Liberal or S D P
candidates in the local elec-
tions because of this. Here I
must disagree. The M a y 6
e l e c t i o n s a r e for d i s t r i c t
c o u n c i l l o r s responsible for
s u c h t h i n g s as p l a n n i n g ,
housing and the environment
and in metropolitan districts
f o r e d u c a t i o n a n d s o c i a l
services. They do not have
any responsibility of course,
for foreign affairs.
As a liberal I believe in
d e c e n t r a l i s a t i o n a n d t h e
i m p o r t a n c e of t h e l o c a l
community. I believe these
e l e c t i o n s s h o u l d be t a k e n
seriously in their own right
and not be seen just as an
opinion poll on the govern-
ment's performance. It is only
in this way that we will get
good and responsible local
government and resist calls
for greater government con-
trol of local authorities.

Dear Mark
W h a t the hell is going on in
the I C Bookshop? I was in
there yesterday and noticed
shelves filled with hundreds of
E n i d Blyton titles! Have they
not read the recent evidence
that she was a jack-booted
fascist thug, born not 7 V 2
thousand miles from the main
Argentinian port of Capitano
L i n l e y a n i o ? W h a t is more
they didn't have the one I
wanted {Shadow the Sheepdog).
W e s h o u l d a p p l a u d
Mooney's move downstairs in
Southside and make plans for
the next stage, the burying of
M o o n e y , his staff a n d his
disgusting corned beef in a
mass grave i n the Q u e e n s
L a w n .
I was glad to see that in
U n i v e r s i t y C h a l l e n g e the
questions were changed so as
to be more appropriate to I C
students. In the episode I saw
the team stormed home with
answers such as " N o d d y " and
" T o a d of T o a d H a l l " ! Well
done boys!
W i t h letters like this can
anyone tell me why I wasn't
i n c l u d e d i n S F S o c r a g
N M E 3 ? I p u t it d o w n to
insanity on their part.
