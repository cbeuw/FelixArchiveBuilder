One large , slightly worn
micrometer + one quarter
final, University Challenge
Imperial College's run of success in University Challenge
ended on Wednesday when they were beaten by St. Andrew's.
The team of Tim Pigden, Gordon Masterton, Alun Griffiths
and Martin S. Taylor had won three consecutive rounds of the
competition to reach the quarter-final
The Union mascot Mike was stolen from the Union Office
between 2 and 7 am yesterday morning.
T h e massive micrometer needs three people to carry it and was left
behind the U n i o n receptionist's desk by a group, including President
Nick M o r t o n and H o n o r a r y Secretary M a r c o L e d w o l d , who had just
returned from the University Challenge quarter-final in Manchester.
T h e incident was reported by cleaners who found the Senior
C o m m o n R o o m door and the door connecting the S C R and U n i o n
office both open. T h e raiders are believed to have entered through the
S C R and passed the mascot out through a S C R window to a vehicle
waiting outside.
Immediate suspects were K i n g s College who have twice broken into
the gymnasium looking for their mascot Reggie since it was violated by
the R o y a l College of Science U n i o n last February. However when
M a r c o L e d w o l d went to a K i n g s U n i o n General M e e t i n g yesterday
M i k e was not on display.
Those responsible for the loss now believe C i t y and Guilds College
U n i o n have M i k e while the popular theory in the F E L I X Office that it
was taken by A r g e n t i n i a n scrap metal dealers.
...and found again.

T h e final score was 365 to 160 although the result could have been
different had I C been slightly quicker to answer. Indeed question-
master Bamber Gascoigne re-assured the I C team several times that
their buzzers were working properly, as they were just beaten to it on
many occasions.

A n d r e w ' s heavily defeated I C , although it was later revealed that St.
A n d r e w ' s had sat in on the round from w h i c h the questions were taken.

T h e contests were recorded in the G r a n a d a Television Studios in
