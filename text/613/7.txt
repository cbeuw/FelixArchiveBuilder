H. G. Wells
First of all let me tell anyone who still thinks that
there will be two sabbatical Wellsoc posts next
year, there won't be. The last Wellsoc article was
an April Fool and it did take in quite a few people
I know. Most worried was my External Secretary
who was most annoyed at not having been told
that she was to have a year off.
The Wellsoc Dinner was a splendid affair at
the Penta Hotel. I won't say any more about it
since those of us who were there know what
happened. Those of you who weren't couldn't
really give a toss.
A l l the posts but one were filled at the Annual
General Meeting of the society. We do still need,
however, a Publiqity Officer. The job will entail
creating Wellsoc posters for the weekly lectures.
It isn't that difficult and can be done after a few
minutes intsruction. The perks of the job include
meeting and dining with interesting speakers,
having a say in who the speakers are, learning
how to make posters, but best of all getting to
know me.
If you are interested get in touch via Physics
U G pigeonholes.
Finally be sure and come to our first lecture of
this term 'Cybernetics' by Dr. Pask. Y o u ' l l be
suprised how close science fact is to science
fiction. It'll be in Elec E n g 408, 7:30pm on
Monday.

those of Subwarden.
The posts require individuals who can display
enthusiastic and conscientious application, initia-

The successful applicants for the above posts
would normally be postgraduates, but applications
from others will be considered.
Applications, including a concise but informa-'

Warden, Dr P.W. Jowitt, Department of Civil
Engineering. The closing date is Friday, May 21,
1982. A single application will suffice for both
categories of appointment. Applicants should note
that appointment will be made by interviews from a
short list selected on the basis of the letters of
application.
Cricket
A p r i l 28 saw the start of a new season of the
best and most English of our national games,
played with idealistic C o r i n t h i a n attitudes
and O l y m p i a n ethos of p r i m a r y importance-
amateurism at its best, exemplified by an
astute spectator, awakened from his sleep,
yelling " G i v e it some welly, son!" A l l too
soon are those student days gone forever, the
days of festering support garments draped
over radiators throughout residence halls, the
big wide world beckons as the new graduate
emerges f r o m his c o c o o n , to l e a r n t h a t
fairness and reality are often opposed; never
again will that great umpire in the sky smile
favourably upon h i m and beer will always
cost more than 40p a pint.
P l a y e d t w o , w o n t w o c a n ' t be b a d ,
especially with 412 runs scored for the loss of
10 wickets. Chelsea College were well beaten
by I C 1st X I 6182 for 3 dec) at H a r l i n g t o n ,
W e d A p r 28. This 40 overs match produced a
magnificent 100 N O by our own Neil C l a r k
aided and abetted by that rotund Geordie
M r Bell, dispersing that skill is needed to play
cricket, with 33 stripey runs without the aid
of an iron-lung. C l a r k ' s ton finished off the
opposition who mustered 143 for 8 off their
overs, with T e a r taking 4 for 28 (as he keeps
telling us) and Eastland, 3 for 12. Sundays
excellent hosts, M a g d a l e n College, O x f o r d ,
again provided marvellous hospitality w h i c h
we duly thanked them for by giving them a
good old stuffing which must have made their
cucumber sandwiches hard to stomach. Bell
(57) and Magness (82), after a good start by
our openers, provided the fireworks, leading
to 2 3 0 for 7 d e c l a r e d . T h e o p p o s i t i o n
capitulated for 132, with S i m p k i n and T e a r
apologetically taking 3 wickets each.
Football

Q Sailing
A l a r g e c o n t i n g e n t of I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
d e s c e n d e d on the defenceless " c l o g g i e s "
during the first week in A p r i l to sail i n the
" Z e International Studenten Sport T o E r
N o u i " at T i l b u r g in H o l l a n d .
T h e event opened on Wednesday with a
small amount of sailing, which we won,
followed by a " t o r c h race". F o r this they
offered a prize for the most ridiculous team,
I C took it as an oportunity to throw molten
wax round the place whilst racing three
legged with flashing bow ties or carrying
i F i o n a . D e s p i t e the s o m e w h a t c o m i c a l
appearance of Strathclyde University i n their
kilts they d i d not merit as highly on the
D u t c h " o r i g i n a l i t y " scale and so I C took the
prize.
Thursday saw some more sailing w h i c h we
won. T h e T i l b u r g II volleyball team were
short of members, so I C S C took up volleyball
a n d J u l i a n b r o k e a f i n g e r . T h e first I C
hospital case. Sue finding that car boot lids
are harder than heads, made the second I C
hospital case as she went to have her eye
patched together.
A t this stage it seemed a good time to teach
the opposition how to boat race. This time
with " b i e r " (lager) served in ' / 3 p t glasses.
D o w n i n g two each I C still managed to w i n .
Friday, sadness. Slight error or judgement
Leiden get 1st, 2nd, 3rd on the start line
sailing. T h e rules -do not allow the taking of
"greens" but insist instead on 720° turns (two
complete revolutions) and at once it seems I C
should take up ballroom dancing so good are
they at p i r o u e t t i n g . H o w e v e r , this gives
Lieden victory, i n their o w n boats, w h i c h
incidentally were/were not as exciting to sail
as "optimists". However, since they were the
only team to beat us, I C came second. A b o u t
this point in an artistic disembarkation Pat
left a boat after a blow on the nose from a
boom. T h i r d I C hospital case. T h e n back to
the bar ("canteen") for liquid consolation,
for losing, H e x a p a w n played with glasses on
a tiled floor and bottle racing, which we won.
T h a n k s to " P e n d r a g o n K a t h o l i e k e
Hogeschool" for excellent organisation a n d
to N i c k for use of his van and to Pat for
organisation and use of his car.
T h e cast: Debbie, Fiona, Graham, Ian, Jim,
Julian, Mike, Nick, Pat, Richard, Simon, Sue.

T h e W o r t h i n g M i x e d H o c k e y Festival
Stevie led his merry band.
D o w n to the coast to sea a n d sand,
But although we wished for blazing sun,
As it turned out there wasn't none!
P h i l W e b b came down from L o n d o n town
A n d looked us up bearing a frown
So as we knew the veterans weren't p l a y i n g
W e put h i m on and started praying!
Despite Phil's m a p we camped on site
A n d set about contracting frostbite!
T h e late arrival of K a r e n and Sarah
Was explained by the call for a car repairer
Barry's clapped out T r i u m p h if seemed
H a d finally gone a n d r u n out of steam!
T h e first game was lost 1-0 I ' m afraid
So was the second—but on we played.
W e found a pub to sit and think
A n d were helped out by some half-price
drinks!
For A n d r e w this was the weekend's high
— N o t the hockey but the chefs turkey pie!
Sunday dawned to peaceful snores
As we played out a nil-nil draw
However everyone was heard to rave
A b o u t Jonesey's fabulous penalty save
T h e last match on we had to w i n
So Steve and Alison tucked goals i n
T h e n Barry and P h i l added two more
T o make the score—you've guessed it—four
T h e reason for the w i n was clear
— B a r r y a n d P h i l had taken to beer
However well they played I insist
T h a t both of them were totally pissed!
T h e squad: C. Jones, R. Mason, B. Franklin,
