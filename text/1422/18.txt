MÖchten sie mein Manschaft burst
onto the Slitherlink scene for first time
in 2009 to just pip Shotgun to the
winners’ post. This makes me happy,
and when I get happy, you get points!
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Shotgun are really getting to me
down here. Every week they win
this. I offered you double points
and still you ignore me. What
else do you want? This week felix
is offering a Yorkie bar too. So
please send us a correct puzzle!
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku;
we’ve just replaced numbers
with letters. Complete the puzzle
and then send the whole grid to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the
word alone. It’s not an anagram.

Going Underground
I was informed by Shotgun that the
first ‘Going Underground’ had two
answers, South Kensington and Liver-
pool Street. Well done- 5 points! Last
week’s winners were Shotgun... again.
If you found COVENT GARDEN, your
mother should be proud.
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned
a value, 1-26 (see table) and when add-
ed together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to su-

This Coffee Break challenge is brought
to you by the Recreational Clubs
Committee, because in four weeks,
on the 28th February it’s the Annual
RCC Nighthike. One crazy night of
clue finding, adventurous walking and
hopefully a bit of map reading (but if
you can’t don’t let that put you off).
To launch the Science Challenge, this
week’s titillation is on the theme of
the Royal College of Science, more
precisely the questions are based on
the outsides of the various science
buildings. But don’t worry engineers,
it’ll be your turn next week!
All you have to do is track down the
answers, email them to coffee@felix.
imperial.ac.uk and you’ll get ‘RCC
points’. They tell us points definitely
mean prizes, so go check this for loads
of pictures and infomation, www.un-
ion.ic.ac.uk/rcc/nighthike. Here are
this week’s questions for all of you hap-
py hikers to digest:
Blackett Laboratory: What giant
covalent structure is depicted above
the main entrance?
Biochemistry entrance: What are
the names of the two Nobel laureates
who make the chemistry building a
‘National Chemical landmark’?
Chemistry: What date was the
extensiontotheChemistrydepartment
opened by the Royal Highness the
Princess Royal?
RCC Nighthike Quizzy Wizzy
Huxley Building: The Huxley building
is the Maths and Computing building,
but what subject was Thomas Henry
Huxley a professor of?
RCS1: What are the 2nd, 4th & 6th
names (Right to Left) on RCS1?
And now for the answers from the
last edition’s library foray. Well done
to the winner, Wayne Kerr – come to
felix to collect a iPod shuffle.
1st floor: Six is the number of the glass
study bubble in the red zone, shown by
the number of spots on it.
2nd Floor: Probably about three.
3rd Floor: The Science Museum
library have a complete set of British
Patents up to 1992.
4th Floor: Running with the Devil.
5th floor: In the Economist book of
‘Pocket World in figures’, pages 102 &
103 are titled ‘Stars … and Wars’

Freshly Squeezed!
Union banterings through the eyes of
the Unreal Machine
Births
Following a traumatic week of false
accusations toward both parties of
homosexuality and park bench dwell-
ing, two little rays of sunshine have
brought hope and joy in dark times.
Ralph and Charlotte are proud to an-
nounce the arrival on Wednesday
of two beautiful boys, Leopold and
Wellington. They are in good health
and both are already showing strong
swimming skills.
Deaths
In an effort to dispel any myth follow-
ing last week’s naked Mexican inter-
rogation that took place in the filthy
underworld of the felix office, we re-
gret to announce the loss of a much
loved couple. They took the age-gap
controversy in their stride, standing
for much more than just the mate-
rial things in life, but now remain just
chums.
Marriages
Following the precedent set by their
over-zealous facebook declarations
of love, two barely-adult freshers are
taking the plunge and playing house
together.
You know who your real friends are
The old changing-the-birthday-to-
tomorrow trick employed so cruelly
by facebook sex offenders has often
caught out members of the victim’s
lower social strata. However, this week
has seen the emergence of a nefari-
ous new technique, by which the rap-
ist sets out a rolling birthday date. We
count ten initial non-friends, and three
bottom-feeders idiotic enough to post
birthday wishes the following day.

Virgo
The week starts out
well and is about
to get better. You
have won a free kiss
from felix editor
and Rugby player
extraordinaire Jovan Nedic. Kisses are available
every day, 10am – 5pm to all genders in the
felix office in the west wing of Beit. Attractive
ladies are asked to bring tissues and all others
should have masks. No facial Herpes.
Scorpio
It’s obvious that you
are pretty. Pretty
ugly that is. I suggest
you go to Liverpool
where you will look
passable. If you really
want to look like a hot piece of flesh, make the
trek to deep-fried Scotland. They all look like
proper munters up there- especially in Glasgow.
If there’s one city that the world can do without-
Glasgow would be it.
Libra
So you think you
got rid of that extra
weight you put on
over Christmas. Well
you didn’t and to
make things worse it
was your New Year’s resolution to lose it. If it
wasn’t... look at the size of you! You’re a fucking
elephant, it damn should have been. You are fat
verging upon clinically obese, you disgust me
and all that surround you.
Capricorn
It’s heaven when
you manage to
release your penis
from your flies. This
is an experience
that you will incur
this week as you rush from the toilet to your
9am lecture. You don’t make that 9am. Or in
fact your 11am are you are in Chelsea and
Westminster hospital. If you are a woman, or
not equipped with a willy ignore this. Pint?
Sagittarius
This week you’ll
meet a girl, or
even a boy in the
Union. But this is no
normal encounter.
You are besotted
from first glance and proceed to yell ‘I fucking
love you’ over and over again. This is definitely
not due to the aforementioned cocaine that
you snorted whilst writing your article down in
the felix office. Needless to say, you failed.
Cancer
This week you
discover the
skin covering
the cartilage in
your septum has
disappeared. You
have never noticed this before, and become
quite worried. Enough so to post questions on
online forums. Maybe you shouldn’t have gone
on a drugs binge for 4 months, maybe you
shouldn’t have taken drugs full stop.
Gemini
This week a drugs
raid on your room in
your hall has turned
up unexpected
results. Along with
the expected drugs,
a child’s body was found in your cupboard.
Cause of death, suffocation. Also found was a
snuff kit, gimp mask (complete with breathing
tubes) and various spem filled tubes and
glasses. Bukkake anyone?
Leo
This week begins
with love and happi-
ness in the air. The
new sense of inner
peace is delightful,
but you know it
won’t last. With two days of drudgery of Impe-
rial behind you, you’re once again hollow and
empty inside. You long for that plane ticket
back to Washington, ‘oh Obama... I’m coming
to you, I long to kiss your presidential lips.’
Taurus
This week you
decide to kick your
expensive habit, and
substitute it with red
bull. You seem just
as edgy, but begin to
worry when you start urinating blood. Why is
this happening? How much red bull have you
had? Why am I now addicted to caffeine? You
quickly take up some other addictive habit like
smoking to kick this one.
Aries
Your friends taunt
you for being a coke
head. Teasing you
as you spew out
the most random
of sentences, while
speaking as quickly as possible. You think
everything is normal until you get arrested for
pulling out a gun. Where the hell did you get
a gun? It came with the drugs of course. It’s a
dangerous world out there.
Pisces
This week, you
think about whether
you should buy
a ticket to the
summer ball while
it’s cheap, or blow
the money on a G of charlie. You opt for the
latter because you think it’ll make that night
out in Fulham slightly better. Unfortunately
you snort half in one line and throw up on the
bouncers as soon as you get to the club.
Horocokes, that’ll be the Horoscopes on cocaine
Aquarius
Look at the stars,
look how they shine
for you, look how
all you do is poo...
Well, that’s all about
to change. This is
not a rambling of a man that society has given
up on like a 40 year old prostitute on laxatives,
things are on the way up. Just when you think
things couldn’t get any worse, it all works out.
You get run over by a Robin Reliant.
This week felix got a large shipment of cocaine to help us through the long Wednesday night... I love you

I must start with an apology.
Even though I did promise that
this year we (note we- defiantly
not passing the blame!) would
make no mistakes... last week,
we did. Bugger. What can I do?
On behalf of my team I offer
the most sincere of apologies,
but also congratulations of epic
proportions are in order for both
