A recent poll suggests that communi-
cation between doctors and patients
is improving. Published this month
by the Healthcare Commission, the
survey of patient satisfaction revealed
that 83 percent of patients feel their
doctors listen to them and 70 percent
felt actively involved in any decisions
to undergo treatment. These figures
are a significant rise from the last sur-
vey in 2005.
Chief Executive of the Commis-
sion, Anna Walker, praised the “very
positive” findings of the survey, but
said further improvements are still
required.
At the University of Cambridge, staff
within the School of Clinical Medicine
are working to educate future doctors
in successful and active communica-
tion. Research suggests that more ef-
fective care could potentially reduce
the current burden on the NHS caused
by high readmission rates.
However, Jonathan Silverman, As-
sociate Clinical Dean of the school ex-
pressed caution over the survey find-
ings and felt doctors should be more
concerned with why the remaining 17
percent were not fully happy with the
service.
The survey also showed that al-
though elderly patients were most
satisfied overall with the care they re-
ceived, this did not result from better
communication with their doctor. Af-
ter the 16-29 age group, over-75s were
the least impressed with the informa-
tion they were given, often finding it
lacking in detail or hard to understand.
This may be one of the factors respon-
sible for a rise in readmission of eld-
erly patients from 10 percent to nearly
14 percent within the last decade.
It is hoped that these surveys can
highlight areas for improvement with-
in the NHS, and give a much-needed
morale boost to doctors in the UK.

Could your diet success be affected
by the magazine that you read? Re-
searchers from Newcastle University
have uncovered that UK magazines
are filled with adverts for mostly sug-
ary, salt-filled, low-fibre foods thereby
confusing any health messages their
articles were trying to put across.
In the top 30 most widely read maga-
zines in the UK, over 25% of the food
adverts were for ready meals. Almost
the same amount were for foods “con-
taining fat or sugar,” e.g. ice-cream,
chocolate bars, sweets and full sugar
soft drinks.
“Obviously, it’s up to each of us to de-
cide what we eat” said Dr Jean Adams,
of Newcastle University. “But if we’re
constantly bombarded with images
of unhealthy food every time we pick
up a magazine then we’re going to be
swayed in what we choose.”
The study, published in this month’s
European Journal of Public Health,
found key differences between maga-
zines with different readerships. More
adverts for high fat/sugary foods were
found in magazines aimed at women,
or with readers of a lower social class;
both groups that suffer high levels of
obesity. In contrast, very few of the ads,
only 1.8%, were for fruit and vegeta-
bles and these were mainly in high-end
magazines.
Magazines give mixed
messages with healthy ads
Whilst this research doesn’t link ad-
verts directly with people’s decision
making/eating habits, junk food ads are
already banned from children’s maga-
zines in the UK because of fears over
increasing levels of obesity.
“Health bodies and the government
are trying to encourage all of us to eat a
healthier diet, yet we found that many
of the magazines, especially those tar-
geting lower-income families are full of
adverts promoting food that is largely
unhealthy,” says Dr Adams,
“It’s a battle to stay on the right track
when choosing and preparing meals
and these adverts do little to help.”
A new study suggests that apple juice
could delay the onset of age-related
cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer’s
disease. Researchers from the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts found that mice
receiving the human equivalent of
two glasses of apple juice per day for a
month performed better than normal
mice in maze trials. Not only did they
perform better but the decline in per-
formance observed when the mice got
older was not seen in the mice given
apple juice.
The team found that mice given ap-
ple juice produced less of a protein
fragment, called beta-amyloid. This
protein fragment is known to form
plaques in the brain, commonly found
in Alzheimer’s patients. They believe
the reduction in beta-amyloid could
be the reason for the affect of the ap-
ple juice on the mice.
The lead researcher, Dr. Shea, com-
mented that the results “suggest that
regular consumption of apple juice
can not only help to keep one’s mind
functioning at its best, but may also be
able to delay key aspects of Alzheim-
er’s disease and augment therapeutic
approaches.”
In the past, scientists have shown
that apple juice may protect against
other diseases related to aging includ-
ing cancer, brittle bones, and heart
disease. A study last year also found a
link between apple juice and reduced
wheezing in asthmatic children. These
findings add to the possibility that ap-
ple juice may be better for us than just
for the vitamin C content, and could
be used as a dietary supplement to
enhance existing treatments for many
conditions.

A new study from the University of
Oxford has concluded that ‘hospital
at home’ care programmes are just as
good as treatment in hospital. Such
schemes could potentially reduce NHS
medical care costs, while increasing
hospital bed availability and allowing
patients to benefit from recovering at
home.
The programmes provide elderly
patients who are critically stable with
full medical support at home, avoiding
the need for hospital admission. Such
schemes have proved popular with pa-
tients, their families and hospital staff
and mortality rates now suggest that
there is no extra risk to patients treated
at home. Dr Sasha Shepperd of the Uni-
versity of Oxford says the study “found
no evidence that ‘hospital at home’
care leads to an increase in mortality”.
However, home care is advantageous
because it can be provided for the same
or lower cost.
The study gathered data from ten tri-
als, involving over 1300 patients. Those
involved had chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, were recovering from
stroke or were older patients with acute
conditions.
Dr Shepperd cautions that these re-
sults do not mean hospital care is haz-
ardous but that there are benefits to
treating patients at home. She believes
that more research must be done in or-
dertoseewhowouldbenefitfromhome
care: “More work needs to be done to
determine if there are particular types
of patient who benefit from ‘hospital at
home’ care. This is especially impor-
tant as the level of treatment available
to a person at home, and the ways of
delivering care in both the home and
the hospital, change over time”.

Mankind is not the only source respon-
sible for greenhouse emissions and
some forms of air pollution: the planet
itself is releasing methane, ethane and
propane. A new study, published today
in the journal Science, suggests that
this natural phenomenon plays a con-
siderable role in the dynamics of the
atmosphere.
In the past, geologists at the Italian
National Institute for Geophysics and
Volcanology (INGV) contributed to
the United Nation’s Intergovernmen-
tal Panel on Climate Change with es-
timates on the amount of methane that
naturally leaks in to the atmosphere
from underground compounds: 50
million tons per year which, in terms of
greenhouse effects, is as much as 200
million cars produce in one year.
While methane is a greenhouse gas,
more harmful but less abundant than
carbon dioxide, ethane and propane
pose other concerns. Chemically com-
bined with light and air, ethane and
propane generate tropospheric ozone,
which is poisonous if inhaled. This
should not be confused with strat-
ospheric ozone, the gas that shields
the atmosphere from extraterrestrial
ultra-violet radiation.
According to the new estimates, nat-
ural emissions represent around 17%
and 10% respectively of the amount of
ethane and propane traceable in the
atmosphere.
“We used to have better data on
man-originated releases”, explains
INGV geologist Giuseppe Etiope, who
authored the study together with Paolo
Ciccioli from Italy’s National Research
Council (CNR). “However, we cannot
understand enough about greenhouse
gases and global change if we ignore
where one part of the released gases
comes from”.
An updated global map shows that
seepage spots are mainly distributed on
the Northern hemisphere, by oil com-
pounds and geothermic areas. “Experts
always considered such sources as
marginal and negligible. This assump-
tion is just wrong, as nobody had ever
measured them”, concludes Etiope.
