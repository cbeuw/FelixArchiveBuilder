Good morning. First things first,
how has your season been?
Really good thanks. We have lots of
freshers in this year so had a bit of shaky
start but we are now doing well in both
the leagues and cups. We are the only
hockey team left in BUCS cup.
Any star players within the team?
Well, I could be diplomatic and say
my whole team. However my current
goalkeeper is great - she is the fifth one
we have had this season!
Why so many goalies?
Mainly due to injury, but also due to
the fact that some of the freshers have
found it difficult to fit in the hockey
with the social and work life of IC.
Do you find fitting in hockey a
problem?
No - I simply work harder than most
other people I think. I use the week-
ends to get my work done. The good
thing about hockey is that it is weekly
and scheduled so you know what time
you need to take out.
Clearly in some sports there is a
big difference between the Medi-
cal and IC teams, why do you
think hockey is dominated by IC?
I think the difference is that IC is a
mixed club and we train hard and play
hard. Although this year the medics
are a much better team than in previ-
ous years which will make Varsity far
more exciting (although I hope our
keeper does not get sent off this year!)
Who are you guys playing today?
Medics! What was the score last
time you played them?
3-1 victory in extra time. It was a very
frustrating game and we hope to beat
them by the usual margin at Varsity.
I understand that you have a lot
of fixtures to play this half of the
season - how are you coping with
that?
Well, the Wednesday’s are not really
a problem but if we keep succeeding
in cup games then Sundays will start
filling up. Sundays are always an issue
with getting a team together and mak-
ing sure the energy levels are up!
What stages are you at in the cups?
In the BUCS cup we are in the 4th
round and in ULU cup we are through
to the quarter-finals.
Moving on from the state of play,
how is the social side of ICHC?
Great fun - especially this year with
lots of freshers who have lots of time
and boundless energy!
Any funny stories you want
to share?
Soho Slag has a tenden-
cy to end up in Soho
with a certain Men’s
3rd XI player!
Moving on
from the
hockey club,
what do you
think of the state of sport at
Imperial?
In general it is OK. Obviously it is
not a priority for Imperial students
unlike some other universities, but I
think ICHC do very well, considering
the small numbers available.
What about the rugby - who will
win the J.P
.R. Williams Cup?
I would love to say IC, but on cur-
rent form and past history the medics
will probably do it again. I hope I am
wrong!
So what are your ambitions in
hockey and life?
I want to play hockey for the rest of
my life. It is a sport that you can play
until old age! In life I am one of the few
people on an Engineering course that
actually wants to stay in engineering!
Why do you think there is such a
gap in standard between the
ladies 1st and 2nds?
I think it is simply a fact
that there are not enough
women at Imperial who
want to play. Izzy (la-
dies 2nd XI captain) has
worked really hard to push
the team forward and try
and bring the teams closer,
but at the same time I think it
is good that there is a social
aspect to the hockey. Not a
lot of people really want to
put in the time, but would
just rather play hockey be-
cause they enjoy it, and I
think that is a good thing.
Do you think that there
is a problem in terms of
depth of strength in the
women’s teams.
It is very frustrating for
the players that could come
up, such as Izzy and Bella,
who are both good strong
players, but there is sim-
ply not enough space on
the women’s first team to
bring them along. At
the same time, there
is not enough player
developmentgoing
on to improve the
standard in the
lower teams.
Is there
noth-
ing that
can be done
to improve this
problem?
More pitch space would
be great! It would mean we
would have more space for
training since at the moment we
have six teams all training on one
pitch. Also having coaches would be
great, at the moment we only have the
one coach and he spends his time with
the men’s firsts.
It was mentioned in last weeks
issue that Sport Imperial have
bought new land in Ealing due to
This week Jack Cornish meets up with his female counterpart
Sarah Clayton, the ladies 1st XI captain who has successfully
led a young team to some phenomenal results!
the expansion of Heathrow. Do
you think that they should per-
haps build more hockey pitches?
We have so many players in the club,
similar to that of the football club
and rugby club, yet we only have one
pitch to play and train on. If we only
had a handful of hockey players then
it would make sense to only have one
pitch, but we don’t. So if we could have
more pitches at the new grounds that
would be great!
In my comment last week I was
saying that the rest of the season
is now predictable for a lot of the
teams. Do you think the same can
be said for yours?
I think our season is a bit different to
a lot of the clubs since we did have a
massive influx of freshers this season.
It meant that at the start of the season,
the team was new and not used to play-
ing with each other, but now
we have grown
as a team. I
think some
of those
games that
we narrowly
lost at
the
start
will be dif-
ferent this time
around.
Was a shock losing
so many players
from last season
then?
At the start of the season we
started off with only six players from
Ask the captain -
Sarah Rose Clayton
last year, but I think we have definitely
improved.
Would you agree with the com-
ment I made last week where I
criticised paying £10 to watch the
main event at Varsity?
I don’t think a lot of people go along
to watch it really. Personally I enjoy
Varsity as en event because I play in it,
but I don’t see why quite a lot of people
go to watch all the sports. I go to the
rugby match because it is the start to
rest of my evening before we all go back
to the bar to either commiserate or
celebrate depending on the outcome.
But I do find it quite odd that people
go along to watch the rugby match
because it is a clear cut result and
it is only university level rugby,
I mean I can pay £5 to watch
Saracens play and the level is
much better. Considering
you do get transport as well,
I guess it’s not that bad.
Do you think more
of an effort should
be made to create
a spectacle of the
other sports.
I think it would be
difficult to do since
everyone plays in dif-
ferent locations. For
hockey I know
we do get
quiteacrowd
watching
the games,
mainly
because
players
from
both
clubs

Sarah has been faced with a difficult challenge this year
- having lost a number of key players at the end of last
season she has brought in freshers and senior players
alike to out together a successful squad. Her passion for
drinking, hockey and the occasional epic boogie means
she is made for ICHC! A true defender her play is solid
yet sometimes a little rural which is apparently perfect
for the match against the medics in a few weeks time...

not playing. For the later matches of
hockey we get people screaming from
the sidelines which makes a good at-
mosphere. I don’t know what it would
be like for netball since they don’t have
any viewing areas in Ethos, but it would
be difficult in general since everyone is
all over the place.
Any sporting idols or people you
generally aspire to?
Mark Foster is fit! You can definitely
put that in. But in general no because I
don’t want to be a sports player, that’s
not my aim.
Focusing on women’s hockey
and women’s sport in general,
there is a clear lack of publicity
for it. Even in the sports that are
publicised and televised, such as
football and rugby, the female
equivalent is almost nonexist-
ent. Seeing as hockey itself only
seems to be in the spotlight come
the Olympics, would you say it is
even worse for women’s hockey?
You’re right, there is clearly a lack of
knowledge, especially for female hock-
ey, but I think there are people who are
more interested in it than me. For ex-
ample Vicki, who is my vice-captain, is
Argentinian and it is a huge sport over
there, so she could probably name all
the players and all the teams out there,
and she regularly watches the matches
over the internet.
I think it really is more of a cultural
thing. Not many schools play hockey,
not many people play it in general
from a young age therefore they don’t
know anything about it. The fact that
the sport isn’t really shown in the UK
would also make matters worse.
Finally, anything you want to say?
Ladies please come and play hockey,
we are lots of fun. Oh and see you in
the union next week for the ACC bar
night. The theme is quite good as we’ve
got quite a few teams involved in a Ru-
bik’s Cube type theme. Should be fun!
Winter, a bit chilly wasn’t it? Well, im-
agine if you will, the idea of going to
another country over the festive sea-
son that was not only colder than the
United Kingdom but where you also
had to play eight badminton matches
a day. Whilst you were wallowing in
the après-Christmas spirit, tugging
at straining waistlines, stuffed with a
mixture of turkey and chocolate, a few
noble ICSM Badminton individuals
dusted off their badminton racquets,
picked up their passports and headed
to the University of Twente, Holland
with two hundred and fifty other stu-
dents from across Europe for the In-
ternational Student Badminton Tour-
nament of 2008!
After the flight to Holland, it was
only a short three-hour train ride to
our final destination, Enschede. Upon
arrival we were shown to our sleeping
quarters; to describe them as luxuri-
ous havens of somnolence would be a
lie. It was a sports hall, which boasted
amongst other luxuries, a gigantic and
very cold floor. Luckily for some, alco-
hol was available from the start and so
by the time it was a reasonable hour to
climb blissfully into a warm sleeping
bag, a floor and towel seemed like an
interchangeable alternative.
In the hectic modern world in which
we live, a lot can be said for a nice lie-
in. This attitude was however beaten
into a bruised and bloody submission
by a business-like wake-up call at 8am
the next day.
Breakfast then made its inaugural ap-
pearance. The classic Jam-Ham break-
fast is an oft-overlooked treat that not
many individuals have the pleasure of
experiencing in this country. For us,
however, a jam and ham combined
combination was the pot of gold at
the end of the breakfast rainbow…and
with this solid culinary foundation for
the day, we were ready to hit shuttle-
cocks at some Europeans.
Competing in Regional High, Low
and recreational singles, men’s, wom-
en’s and mixed doubles we shuffled off
to our games with destiny (nice girl,
glossy hair). The tactics employed by
the Imperial Medics players were as
cunning as they were sexy. For many,
a combination of power and accuracy
proved the winning formula, for others
gentle and dignified submission proved
to be the more popular option.
WithareassuringJamandHamlunch
to power us through the matches, we
finished the day (and each of the three
days) exhausted but happy watching
an amazing nationally ranked German
woman destroy the best national male
competitors on the show court. We
clapped; she grunted.
New Year’s was the highlight of
the trip. A superb superhero themed
night where The Crazy 88 and Super
Mario made a special appearance, we
danced away our stiff backs and aching
shoulders and entered 2009 in style,
drinking on the rooftop of the Twente
Union Bar and watching magnificent
fireworks with other students from
England, Ireland, Italy, Germany and
our host country.
I won’t go into details of the remain-
der of the festivities but all in all, on new
year’s day, hungover and battleworn
after many a shuttlecock had been hit,
but refreshed by a ground temperature
of -14 degrees, we reflected on a great
tour, where hunger did not get in the
way of us having a rip-roaring time.

ICSMBC sprint to victory
ICSMBC dominated the UH Winter
Regatta on Sunday 25th January as
they sprinted their way to winning a
phenomenal amount of medals. An
impressive five finals and three vic-
tories were achieved due to the sheer
determination and solid team-work of
the crews.
The preparation and excitement be-
gan on Saturday night for the novice
crews who ‘carbo-loaded’ in Southside
halls.
All members devoured copious
amounts of pasta, sweets, cake, and
popcorn. After the inspirational talks
and encouragement were delivered,
the novices crawled into bed to be
ready for the next day.
The Women’s 2nd VIII (a crew con-
taining two new members, one a nov-
ice) had never rowed together before
and therefore set out early Sunday
morning with their spirits high, hap-
pily battling the heavy rain, freezing
cold and forceful wind with a purpose;
to train to win.
As the weather cheered the Gunners-
bury UL Boathouse filled with anxious
but enthusiastic ICSM supporters,
shouting encouragement far louder
than any of the other supporters.
An interesting start was made by the
Women’s 2nd VIII who raced GKT.
Due to no fault of our crew, the boats
came so close together the launch
commanded the race to stop and it
was decided that the rest of the race
should be finished from that position.
The girls refused to be distracted and
so ploughed on and won all their races
thereafter.
Some absolutely beautiful rowing
was observed from the Girls Novice 1st
VIII who won all their races convinc-
ingly.Thefantasticrowingtechniqueof
Emma Stimson the girls is a result of the dedication of
the entire crew, described well by Cap-
tain Ola Markiewicz: “Races are not
won on the day, but by all the training,
hard work and effort before-hand.” Of
course the commitment, perseverance
and devotion of the captains, coaches
and coxes contributed enormously to
each crew’s success.
The Boys Novice 1st VIII gave a
strong, confident performance and
were placed as the best UH crew.
Having raced the previous day in the
Quintin Head, (without a cox box!)
the Senior Women’s 1st VIII managed
to beat St George’s men but unfortu-
nately weren’t able to beat RUMS in
the final. However, the Senior Men’s
1st VIII were successful in flattening
all competition, thoroughly deserving
the medals that they won.
Team effort was vital on Sunday and
all of the ICSM coxes were vigilant,
passionate and enthusiastic, to the ex-
tent that an attempt to converse with
them between races was met with:
‘Must. Conserve. Voice.’.
Celebration followed the success in
true medic-style with a pub crawl from
Gunnersbury to Hammersmith after
the presentation of medals. A thrilling
day for all involved, ICSMBC has truly
raised its game and shows great prom-
ise of further medals in the future!
Rugby 1sts win first match
to tap and punt the ball cross field
and off the pitch; a move that earned
him Twat of the Match.
The half time score was 12-7 in Im-
perials favour, “Don’t change a thing”
was captain James Pettit’s half time
order. At the beginning of the second
half Oxford came out strong and their
fly half sent IC back into their own
22 with a good chase which made IC
concede a penalty. The three points
conceded were a wake up call for IC. A
loose ball kicked was on and chased by
Flannan O’mahony but he was just un-
able to collect it but Tom Carroll was
on hand to pick it up and beat 2 men to
cross the line. The kick converted, Im-
perial were 19-10 up. Oxford hit back
with some good phases of play from
their backs, but were halted when out-
side centre James Fletcher destroyed
his opposite number with the biggest
hit of the season. IC returned with a
great 50m dash down the wing from
Adam Foley but was stopped just short
of their line. Oxford conceded another
penalty in their 22 which the on form
kicker converted. 22-10 was the final
score IC 1st XV had won for the first
time this season a more jubilant rendi-
tion of Silvia has rarely been seen! Man
of the Match went to Nick Johnstone.
