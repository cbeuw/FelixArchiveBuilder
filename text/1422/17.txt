N
ews just in! Jovan Nedić,
felix editor has fortu-
nately passed away. I
know, right? Awesome!
There will be a party to
commemorate this momentous occa-
sion on the 2nd of March. However,
me telling you this is completely point-
less, as only his closest enemies are in-
vited. Just to rub it in we’re also going
to Byron on Gloucester Road. I don’t
think there is a better way to celebrate
the good news. Well other than mix-
ing his ashes into a pint of snakebite
and downing it to absorb his Serbian
strength. However if you are one of the
few people who abuse him on a daily
basis in the office, then you will hear
more details later.
This news has got me thinking
though. About what kind of music to
play at our party. A soundtrack of his
life as it were. Not just his life, but
yours and mine as well. Let’s not talk
about Jov any more. What I’m trying to
get at here, and admittedly not so well,
is that everyone has a soundtrack to
their life. This covers their daily activi-
ties, moments in the life as well as their
*ahem* death. You know what I’m talk-
ing about now right? Well if not, then
think about it next time you’re walking
Coffee Break

Coffee Break Editor
down the street, listening to music on
your iPod (substitute with other MP3
device). Or just watch people as they
traverse London, with their massive
headphones/earphones on. They all
have a different swagger dependent
on what they’re listening to. Remem-
ber that tune from the Matrix when
the woman in red appears? Music al-
lows people to submerse themselves
into their own little world, whether it
be the Matrix, or starting to listen to
Foxy Lady in your head when you see
someone attractive.
What follows is a list of songs that rep-
resent some of the editors’ lives:
Jovan Nedić:
Djurdjevdan - Bijelo Dugme
Afonso Campos:
That’s The Way - Led Zeppelin
Gilead Amit:
4:33 - John Cage
Mustapher Botchway:
Night Time Manoeuvers - Little Brother
Kadhim Shubber:
Electric Feel - MGMT
Alice Rowlands:
Fat Bottom Girls - Queen
Ravi Pall:
When I Get Down - Logan
