“You know it’s a
good night when...”
Catherine Jones reviews a confusing neo-rave “Bang Face 63”
I
was looking for some excitement
in that early January lull, before
the start of term. With nothing
to lose, I checked out the hyped
up night of the moment, Bang
Face. Yes, that’s right, Bang Face.
Billed as “The birth of neo-rave”, Bang
Face is a throwback to the early nine-
ties rave scene. Remember those glow
sticks, smiley faces and stobe lights?
The promotional material was full of
all those cliches and more. It’s hard to
tell if, and how much, it was “taking the
piss”.
I couldn’t help but feel apprehensive
about the night of madness ahead. Jan-
uary’s Bang Face was circus-themed,
“celebrating the birth of the first mod-
ern circus on this day in 1768”. We were
invited to dress accordingly, as clowns,
acrobats, jugglers and trained animals.
Not to be overly disparaging, it’s not
the easiest theme to pull off.
Still uncertain of what to wear, I
browsed the Internet for help. Oh lucky
me, to stumble across some eyebrow
raising reviews of the 2008 Bang Face
weekender. To paraphrase, they read –
“I can’t recollect much from the night,
but it was definitely fun”! Suspiciously
vague. I couldn’t help but the assume
the author was off their face. There
were no explicit drug references but I
thought I could read between the lines.
Is this what Bang Face means? Get off
your face and mash up your head, like
they did in the early nineties?
Enough. My verdict? Bang Face was
one of the most enjoyable club nights I
have been to in sooo long.
I am ashamed to say I have no use-
ful analysis to make of this night ei-
ther. Before you also go jumping to
conclusions – no, I hadn’t taken any
illegal substances (I don’t agree with
it ). So instead of a review with a neat
chronological narrative, all I have to
present you with are a small selection
of incoherent but amusing memories.
This is my reality, but probably not the
best review ever written. You had to
be there really to fully understand the
Bang Face conversion experience.
The circus theme was truly surreal!
Some people really went the extra mile
with their circus costumes. I met a man
in a clown costume on the dancefloor.
In a surreal haze of giggles, I was given
a fake blond stick-on moustache. Not
in a sleazy way, you understand, just
childlike silliness. I say ‘tache but this
facial accessory was passed around as
an eyebrow, sideburn and beard before
it was settled that it was a “chest wig”.
It’s hard to say what was going on here.
I think this illustrates the friendliness
of the people and the creative ‘anything
goes’ vibe.
This is not to say everyone bothered
dressing up as circus freaks. Quite to
the contrary. Most just came in jeans
and quirky T-shirts. A few hooded
tops were evident, as the temperature
outside verged on minus figures. I
think this shows Bang Face is a place
you could just be yourself, not having
to “dress up” hence “act up” as anything
more than you are. Pretence was left at
the door.
Electrowertz was decorated DIY
style, with amateurish A4 posters and
banners. Anywhere else this would
have looked rubbish but at Bang Face
the humour worked. From the “Safety
nets can just fuck off” banner, to the
clown lilo thrown overhead. The “club
space” was symbolically appropriated
by the crowd, a case of “power to the
people”.
As for the music; acid, jungle, rave
hardcore, drum ‘n’ bass, techno, elec-
tro, breakcore AND electronica. The
specifics are hazy but I think it was
pretty effective as the dancefloor was
rammed. We danced most of the night,
with lasers overhead and glow-sticks in
hand. Some people could call it danc-
ing, others might just call it embarras-
ing random arm flailing, but we had
fun.
After a hard slog on the dancefloor,
we took a few moments to chill in
“Chin Stroking Corner”. Posters of
George Bush, Simon Cowell and “a
thoughtful looking baby”, were hung
on the walls above us. We engaged in
topical conversation with a new ac-
quaintance from Scotland. He declared
Daft Punk at The Arches in Glasgow
his favourite ever club night. Chin car-
ressing increased pace as conversation
moved on to Bang Face. “Is this night
more than just nostalgia?” I pondered.
So what is Bang Face all about? I have
no rational or coherent explanation.
Not that you need reason to have fun.
The closest analogy would be a very
strange house party. Bang Face is a bit
silly, but with a club full of fun, unpre-
tentious people, how can you not have
a great time?
You know it’s a good night when...
your memories are a vivid, incoherent
mish-mash of euphoria and anecdote.
I’m not quite sure if this night felt real,
but it did happen. What’s real anyway?
All we have are memories and you can
trust them, right?
Bang Face returns on Friday the 13th
February, with ‘Vexed Factor’ – a pop
tarts, celeb whore theme.,
If one night just isn’t enough, there’s
the Bang Face weekender in April, ex-
cept that has sold out.

...it’s like
Tequila!
I
know a few people around col-
lege, who clearly have the win-
ter blues. I have been one of
that pathetic group lately. It has
been a cold bleak January but it’s
not just the winter chill that has been
getting me down. Everyday pressures
can be a struggle to cope with, but the
world seems very negative lately.
Some days I could barely muster the
will to get out of bed. On Monday 19th
January I probably should have made
the call and stayed beneath the duvet.
Unfortunately, I have an almost scary
enthusiasm for my subject, so I decid-
ed to go to class.
By late afternoon I had more than re-
gretted that decision. After two choco-
late bars and a gooey chocolate muffin,
in what you could call an attempted
calorie overdose, I had reached rock
bottom.
I was informed by many news out-
lets it was “Blue Monday”, officially the
most depressing day of the year. Why?
– Psychologist Dr Cliff Arnall’s equa-
tion for depression says so. I am unsure
of the scientific basis of this claim but
I felt better knowing I was not the only
one feeling like shit.
I kept on thinking about this Blue
Monday thing. Is this more than some
media myth? It’s hard to say. It is the
time of year people think about buy-
ing holidays and yes, I felt ready to skip
the country on the next available flight.
Brazil would be nice and yes, that’s a
hint.
It’s a bit of a cliche but I think the
Media is like a shot of tequila. It’s in-
toxicating, but you should take it with
a pinch of salt, a bite of lemon and be
prepared for a bitter aftertaste. Just try
not to vomit later on. And if you insist
on vomiting, please not on any item of
my clothing. Or anywhere near me.
Stillunsatisfiedwithlifeandashamed
of my excessive comfort eating, I knew
something had to be done. The solu-
tion seemed obvious; Blue Monday.
I should be dancing to New Order’s
“Blue Monday” rather than feeling
blue on a Monday. So this week’s page
is dedicated to escapism, in its many
varied forms. Have fun, have diver-
sions for the mind, don’t let the world
get you down. And don’t drink too
much. (Consider the long term impli-
cations of your actions for your health
and wellbeing.)
