It’s been nearly four years since Antony
& The Johnsons released their Mercu-
ry Award-winning I Am A Bird Now.
Rather than rest on his laurels, Antony
Hegarty has spent much of that time
contributing his uniquely androgy-
nous alto to the likes of CocoRosie and
Björk, while almost breaking out into
the wider mainstream when Hercules
and Love Affair (ingeniously) turned
him into a disco diva on ‘Blind’ – argu-
ably the best single of last year.
Despite the genre hopping, The Cry-
ing Light sees Antony returning to the
day job and the Johnsons’ third album
pretty much picks up from where Bird
left off. ‘Her Eyes Are Underneath The
Ground’ greets us with the delicately
played piano and cello that have be-

The reason I like Vivian Girls is that
they appeal to some kind of nostalgic
feeling in me, the way it felt to be a
teenage girl invigorated by the spirit of
the riot grrrl movement but a few years
too late to be a part of it. Vivian Girls
are three girls with the nicknames Cas-
sie Ramone, Kickball Katy, and Ali,
who got together in 2007 to form an
all-girl indie rock band, unaware that it
would cause the surge in underground
success and excitement of music critics
that it has done. I do love it when girls
are playing guitars or drums because
we are a minority in the vast sea of
male indie rock musicians, girl power!

Return of the Johnsons (and Tony)
Anthony Hegarty returns with his first record since the pop-electro masterpiece of Hercules and Love Affair.

is even more prominent in the second
track ‘Epilepsy Is Dancing’, which sees
someone finding solitude in rhythm,
as Antony marries lyrics like “All the
metal burned in me….cut me in quad-
rants” to a gentle waltz.
This juxtaposition of the lovely with
the not-quite-so, forms the bulk of
Antony’s metier, serving as a faithful
ode to butoh’s legendary Kazuo Ohno.
Despite the presence of Ohno on the
cover of the album, the strong themes
of sexuality and identity are less evi-
dent on this outing, being replaced
instead by those of maternal love (the
aforementioned ‘…Ground’) and na-
ture where, perhaps rather mawkishly,
he sings for the sun’s warmth on ‘Day-
light and the Sun’. That this particular
track doesn’t end up unlistenable is a
testament to the band’s way with melo-
dies and the lovely production during a
dramatic key change halfway through.
This, together with the understated ar-
rangements, is what makes the band
shine brightest in the gloomiest, most
intimate moments. Starting with some
murmuring acoustic guitars, ‘One
Dove’ slowly unfurls with shuffling
percussion and brass that sounds as
broken and wounded as Antony, while
wailing flutes meet his anxiety and fear
of a changing landscape in ‘Another
World’.
Unifying the record, of course, is
Antony’s take-it-or-leave-it vocals.
For the most part, he still sounds like
he’s singing under a bright spotlight
while sitting on a smokey stage next to
a grand piano (you know…), adding a
huge amount of operatic theatricality
to practically every song. On ‘Dust and
Water’, he attempts Björk-ish mum-
blings quite successfully, but his overly
aggressive delivery on ‘Aeon’ sees him
confuse raw passion for mascara-
strewn melodrama.
Those already unconvinced by An-
tony & The Johnson’s balladry will
find little in ‘The Crying Light’ that
will convert them, particularly if it’s
the voice that drives them away in the
first place. However, those willing to
explore a little deeper are likely to find
that the four year wait was more than
worth their while.
“That this
particular track
doesn’t end up
unlistenable is a
testament to the
band’s way with
melodies”
come the band’s signature since their
debut, while Antony’s keening vocals
drape over a dark and sombre melody.
A richly quiet track, it beautifully dem-
onstrates Antony’s careful poetry and
when he sings “I saw six eyes glisten-
ing in my womb/I felt you calling me
in the gloom”, his panache for mixing
the romantic with the disturbing. This
Anthony wears his heart on his face. Because he’s got no sleeves. It’s a laugh a minute down here in the felix office.
claimed album Call To Mind, released
in 2007.
Stylistically, Commix are different to
other drum and bass producers, with
plenty of tech housey influences as well
as a bit of minimal electro. Their last al-
bum, The Future Sound Of Cambridge
Vol. 3 (Hospital Records), a joint-re-
lease with Logistics and Nu:Tone, was
a great example of how, in contrast to
a lot of other productions, a great d’n’b
track doesn’t have to be a ceaseless au-
ral onslaught across your entire hear-
ing range. Thankfully, this attitude has
been directly applied to this album and
the end result is an unusually delicate
and thoughtful mix – not just for d’n’b,
but also for electronic dance music in
general.
The whole mix flows effortlessly
from one track into another, gently
opening with the duo’s own track ‘Life
We Live’. The moody synths of DatA’s
The Causeway and Logistics’ Murdera-
tion pave the way for the deep bassline
and mysterious vocal samples of Com-
mix’s Justified.
Touring through tracks from some of
the most innovative producers in d’n’b,
such as Spectrasoul and Calibre, Com-
mix build tension and then drop, in
the highlight of the record, their track
‘Bear Music’, with its heavy hitting and
cavernous sub-bass. The album winds
up perfectly with the smooth, down-
tempo ‘Photograph’ by Instra:mental.
With this mix, Commix are trying
to rekindle the interest of people who
gave up on drum ‘n’ bass a few years
ago. I think they will: Commix have
created an outstanding mix that will
not only appeal to drum ‘n’ bass heads,
but to anyone who has interest in elec-
tronic music.

To see Vivian Girls walk out onto the
stage is to see a band who look exactly
as you imagine they would before you
see them: lazily dishevelled, implacable
charity shop-esque clothes, smatter-
ings of ironic tattoos (teacups, cassette
tapes, milkshakes), unintentionally
cool (well they did grow up in Brook-
lyn, New York). After several requests
for more feedback on the guitar, they
launched into songs from their debut
album (s/t), with simple guitar riffs and
monotonous vocals that reflect their
impassive lyrics.
They play music that is a cross be-
tween the American garage rock of
the early ‘90s and the indie britpop of
bands like Sleeper and Talulah Gosh,
drawn out and fuzzed up like shoe-
gaze. It’s not a wholy original sound, so
many bands have the same influences,
but what Vivian Girls do is do it well.
Live, they are faster, harsher. Their
set is peppered with little bits of con-
versation as they try to engage with the
crowd. The venue was sold out (a rare
thing at White Heat) though the crowd
was not a very enthusiastic one - at one
point Katy asked “Isn’t this supposed
to be a party?” and was answered by a
few muttered chuckles and some shuf-
fling of feet.
Overall however, I’d say it was pretty
good, and if they release new material
and tour in the future, there is a good
chance I will see them again.
All American Rejects looking like a bunch of cunts
in the US billboard top 100, telling us
one thing and one thing only - America
is still a country of wankers, regard-

In all honesty, I expected very little
from this single, and unsurprisingly it
delivered exactly that. Three minutes
and thirty three seconds of three chord
mediocrity is interspersed by the
whiny wannabe teenage vocals of Rit-
ter, painfully aching for a return to an
age when someone might have cared.
“Tomorrow you’ll be thinking to your-
self, where did it all go wrong” shouts
Ritter rather poignantly. Well Sir, you
tell us. Oh wait - it never was ‘right’ in
the first place, was it? Towards the end
of the song, the band attempts to haul
it out of the depths awfulness with a
load of embarrassing background vo-
cal chanting. Enough said.
Apparently this song has reached #6 This one time in year 9, B*Witched came and played at my school, after they had become number 1. Cool.
time around. But maybe I’m being a bit
too harsh with this. After all, a lot of
teenagers love this bands’ music. But
that’s exactly the problem. It’s the sort
of track that may have sufficed back
when you were 14, getting pissed from
the fumes of a can of Fosters at your
mates’ house party whilst ‘rebelliously’
going for a shit in their mums bed, but
now it just ain’t funny. Move along
skipper.
