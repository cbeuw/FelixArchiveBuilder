Dear Sir
On reading this week's FELIX I
thought that all the varieties of S
Imperialis had been described on
page three, only to find a sixth
manifesting itself on page four! I
refer of course to S Imp pseudo-
intellectualis, yes — Justin'wounded'
Newland was at it again.
As the readers of FELIX are by
now all too painfully aware, J N
considers that a scribe of his
calibre may by Divine Right inflict
upon a fortunate readership any
such drivel he might feel 'inspired'
to write. Are we not 'privileged' to
be allowed such glimpses of the
insights of so stimulating a historian-
philosopher as Mr Newland right
here in our own little paper?
There'are just two flaws in what
Mr N calls his 'literary style'. The
Dear Justin Newland
Anyone whose prose is published
can expect to receive criticism. It is
the writer's responsibility to sift
through comments on his work
and find the valid complaints and
learn from them, also to reply to
those points that require a rejoinder.
It is not his duty to compound any
original felony by insulting those
who make perfectly reasonable
comments on his style.
As to the confinement of "aesthetic
comments" (your phrase, not mine)
to the issue of the matching of
style to content, I believe that in
some dim and distant era the essay
was considered as a highly respected
art form. Incidentally an art form
that Miss Anne Marie Tomsett
(one of the recipients of your
tongue's sharper edge, last week) is
adept at to the extent of jointly
being awarded the Arthur Acland
Essay Prize, only a year or so ago.
Justin, dearest heart, of course
you may use metaphor, simile and
any literary embellishment save
cliche; but try not to be verbose,
and, please try to use embellish-
first of these is that he has nothing
to say, the second that he doesn't
know when to stop saying it.
Language is supposed to be an
instrument of communication, not
a 'smokescreen' for ignorance. If
one has nothing to say then say
nothing!
Worse than the quantity of
verbal diarrhoea which Mr N has
been able to produce is the actual
nature of it. The 'points' made by
him in both of the writings printed
by FELIX over the past three
weeks do not bear the hallmarks of
an informed historian trying to
capture the truth from the facts in
the most concise possible combin-
ation of well chosen words, as I
suspect Mr N would like to think
they do. Instead they betray him as
a bigot who has taken it upon
himself to judge a culture worlds
ments to accentuate the points you
wish to make, not merely to show
off. Clarity and economy are more
important components of an
articulate style of writing than any
mere embroidery.
Your vocabulary is admittedly
extensive, but there is the world of
differencebetweenusinganunfamiliar
word because it exactly, conveys
the meaning intended (or because
it allows a little alliteration or
otherwise sounds nice), and using a
word because you looked it up in a
dictionary this morning and thought
it looked obscure. FELIX is a
magazine, not a 'crib sheet' for Call
•My Bluff.
As to the content of your articles,
my world weary eyes find them
invariably naive and insufferably
pompous (as would eyes more
cynical, find my, so far unwritten,
opinions of world politics, the
human situation, life, the universe,
and everything).
At the risk of provoking the
derision and hostility of some of my
apart from his own purely by his
own standards and, furthermore,
as an ill-informed 'pseud' who
attempts to force square historical
facts into round present-day
situations.
If Mr N is ever to make future
contributions to FELIX or any
publication (not I trust without
careful consideration on his part)
then if he wishes to be treated with
respect at all he will have to
acquire that most elusive of virtues,
namely humility. I would strongly
recommend to him that such a
deflation of his over-sensitive ego
would quickly rid his writing of the
overtly patron<sing and pointlessly
sarcastic tone which make him so
offensive to those who have to
read the crap.
Perhaps Mr N believes that some
ofwhat he has written is worthwhile —
his 'solution' to the U S / I r a n
readers, I will couch my concluding
marks in a figure of speech (not to
mention rip them off directly from
the end of last week's epistle).
It is only when every author's
belief in the English language, or
some other medium embodying the
principles of communication, has
been nourished by the rains of time
that the flower of universal style
and articulacy will prosper.
Until then we must endure the
stench of cliche, the sickness of the
cumbersome sentence, the confusion
of millions, and the most nauseous
sight on this earth . . . the bickering
of writers.
Cheers, etc

The Huxley Club was formed in
1979 by a group of IC graduates
who have entered the teaching
profession. The objects of the Club
are to establish a n d m a i n t a i n
contact between IC graduates now
teaching and to create a closer and
more abiding link between their
s c h o o l s a n d the C o l l e g e t h a n
otherwise exists.
T h e C l u b meets twice a year:
during the winter for an Annual
Dinner, usually in L o n d o n , and
again in the summer for a more
informal gathering outside Lorfdon,
at which guests are welcome.
Membership is open to any ex-IC
g r a d u a t e or p o s t g r a d u a t e now
teaching. There is no subscription,
but an appropriate charge to those
attending is made to meet the cost
of each function. Anyone eligible
who would like to join the Huxley
C l u b is asked to write to the
Chairman:
Mr David Rossell
21 Mallard Road
Selsdvn Vale
South Croydon
(Telephone: 01-651-2819)
The Club would also like to be of
assistance to any present IC students
c o n t e m p l a t i n g or i n t e n d i n g a
teaching career, by enabling them
to meet ex-IC people now teaching
and perhaps visit a school or two.
Any such are cordially invited to get
in touch with the Club's IC Corres-
pondent, M r J o h n Thole, at 53
Prince's Gate (internal 2659).
problem is what can only be called
'pseudo-idealism' — ie naive to the
point of stupidity. The 'springs of
humanism' have yet to prevent one
war — to start with JN seems to
have forgotten about the funda-
mental opposition of different
nations to each other, never mind
in this specific instance the resent-
ment harboured by Iran, not
without cause, for the US.
If I may 'couch my concluding
remarks in a figure of speech' — if
Mr Newland must toss off his ego
with such ill-considered trash as
we've seen recently will he do us all
a favour and keep it out of FELIX,
then at least we won't have to
watch.
Yours exhaustively

Dear Colin
With regard to the current
plague of French kids around
Southside; on Sunday I considered
having a Mooney at 12:30 (a quite
respectable hour for lunch), but
upon finding Southside Refectory
full of our foreign visitors, changed
my mind. Exactly the same situation
occurred at 5:20pm, whereupon I
patronised one of the local 'fast food'
stores. Mooney is cutting his own
throat in accommodating these
obnoxious kids, who are disrupting
the eating habits and revision of
students at this crucial time of year.
Yours hungrily
