R E V I E W S
THE GREENPEACE CHRONICLE
By Robert Hunter
At 11:00am on 6th November 1971, Bering Sea time, James R
Schlesinger gave the 'go', triggering a nuclear phenomenon
whose force was measured at five megatons, flaming to the
temperature of the sun, instanteously carving a cavern the size of
four football fields in diameter out of what had before been solid
Aleutian rock.
Rare peregrine falcons and bald eagles sitting on rock ledges
had their legs driven up through their bodies. Some one thousand
sea otters died in the Bering Sea, their ears split by the
shockwave, their wet brown bodies left to wash up on the shore
for weeks afterwards.
"Everything has gone as expected," was the offical statement.
A n emotive passage; the book the nuclear tests on the Aleutian
is full of them. A t times the
sentimentality goes a little over"
t h e t o p . T h e b o o k is full of
r o m a n t i c i m a g e s ; f a c i n g the
harpoons of the Russian whalers;
standing over baby H a r p seals;
sailing into nuclear test zones.
A n o r g a n i s a t i o n b o r n of the
West C o a s t hippie movement
in Pacific C a n a d a ; founded on
u n i v e r s a l love a n d c o n c e r n ,
driven by emotion and showman
flair; the Greenpeace movement
has been at the forefront of
"emotion conservation", cuddly
seal pups, majestic leviathans.
Right or wrong is not for me to
judge. It was effective. It still is
and makes a great story.
The "chronicle" traces the
b e g i n n i n g s of the m o v e m e n t
through the personal view of
one m a n , a reporter by trade,
who was in at the beginning
and became the president for a
w h i l e . T h e d o c u m e n t a r y a p -
p r o a c h d r a g s in p l a c e s , b u t
contrasts with highs of emotional
frenzy.
It began with opposition to
Islands, off Alaska. It follows
the isolated beginnings, a lone
fishing smack sailing through i
t h e N o r t h P a c i f i c w i n t e r t o
" b e a r w i t n e s s " at the b o m b
tests.
T h e cause of the whale, a n d
t h e e x p o n e n t i a l g r o w t h of
affiliated groups.
The C a n a d i a n hunts and the
famous clubbing seals campaign.

The book stops curiously. B y
1977 the group had realised a

f a c t i o n s p u l l i n g i n d i f f e r e n t
directions. It signalled the end
of Robert Hunter's involvement
with Greenpeace.
Greenpeace still exists.
In other hands.
T h e i r o n y of t h e B r i t i s h
edition of the book is that the
cover depicts a composite with
the " R a i n b o w Warriqr"; a ship
funded by the European G r e e n -

Dear Sid
Saw the Young Marble Giants I
can recommend them whole-
heartedly, and I'm going to try to
catch them next time they play
within striking distance. As you
probably know from listening to the
album they're a sort of sparse,
minimalist reggaeish band with the
gaps in the music being as important
as the notes in between. There's
only three of them: Phil Moxham,
organ and guitar (puts in the
brilliant little touches); Stuart
Moxham, bass and organ (keeps
the whole show running â€” well,
sort of trolling along anyway);
Alison Statton, vocals (sounds as if
she's singing to herself, looks
totally unlike yer average lady
frontperson, none of this fancy
clothes, tight trousers rubbish, she
looks the sort of girl you want to
drag off stage and wrap in cotton
wool to protect her from the
nasties). They use a rhy,.im box
instead of a drummer, but blend
around it so well that it's not
obtrusive, and succeed in producing
far more interesting and varied
rhythms than the likes of After the
Fire, Gary Numan and New Musik.
The organ had a lovely 'warm'
sound and considering only one
effects pedal was used during the
set, they produced a hell of a range
of guitar sounds. The songs are
very impressive, and despite the
stark way they're presented, they
are actually quite 'catchy'.
All in all, like nobody I'd ever
heard before, and they seemed to
enjoy it as much as we did. Jeremy
and I sang along, Pinball bopped
away merrily, Dave Jago tapped his
feet and swayed about a bit, and
even Steve Marshall and Simon
Turner enjoyed it.
Logic were disappointing. They
used (way back in the mists of
time, ie, last year) to have all these
unexpected rhythm changes and so
on, and I used to get drenched in
sweat bopping away at the front at
Logic gigs. Not so this time, I
merely worked up a mild flush (or
thereabouts), they just weren't as
infectious somehow. The new bass
player, John, an ex-busker (doesn't
sing with them, but he's got a
phenomenal voice, if I remember
correctly), anyway where was I?
He's a brilliant bassist, the original
five fingers and a thumb job, but he
takes over the sound too much.
Lora's sax playing was somewhat
staid, and looking back on it the
news songs are too polished,
though I'd say they still knock
spots off most bands around.
Pinball said they'd become too
accomplished and lost whatever it
was they used to have. He'd seen
them on Thursday as well, and said
they were worse then. They still
seem to care about the audience
though. I don't know if it was
coincidence, but during a gap while
they were fixing a snare drum, I
asked the bass player to get them
to play Wake Up 'cause I had to
go before the set finished and it
was down on the song list (impru-
dently placed on the stage just in
front of me) as the last song (this
sentence is appalling!) and they
played it as their next song. Nice,
eh! I had to miss the end of the set
to go off and do this 'ere radio
programme, but apparently some
pea-brained imbecile of a skinhead
sprayed the stage with a fire
extinguisher (and the band played
on!). He was probably a relative of
the mindless excrement that beat
someone up in this toilets during
the interval. It seems to me that
there's at least as much trouble at
the Nashville as there ever was,
despite their ridiculous 21+ only
rule.
Anyway, a fun time was had by
nearly all. See the Young Marble
Giants if you can, and Essential
Logic have still got what it takes
even if they're not showing it too
much at the minute. Got to pack
up writing now 'cause the records
coming to an end and if I don't set
the next one off there'll be an
embarassing pause.
Cheers
