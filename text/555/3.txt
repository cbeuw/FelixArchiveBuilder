The Joint Rag Committee met on Wednesday
14th May and among its tasks was that of
choosing, from the long list of helpful charities
which write to us, our beneficiaries for next
year. I am happy to report that the overwhelming
feeling was that we should continue to support
the National Deaf Children's Society, and I
think this reflects the importance of personal
contact (such as the Caber Tossing) and also
that we know every penny we raise will buy
much-needed equipment which would simply
not be available from any other source. This
trend was underlined in the minor charities we
chose: £3,000 is to be given to A c t i o n in
Distress, a children's charity working in the
Third World, to be used for a specific project
about which we will get full details, and £5,000
will be used to run a project called A C T I V E
which designs and produces various aids for
the specific individual needs of handicapped
children and adults. A s well as the close liason
due to the fact we are its sole source of
income, we hope to involve the engineering
students in the design aspect.
Also at the meeting the officers for next year
were elected, as follows:
Secretary: Alan Edwards
Junior Treasurer: Jon Davis
Publicity Officer: Steve Tyson
Rag Mag Editor: Dave Jago
I am sure they will all do a great job, and
w i s h t h e m , a n d Ian H o d g s o n , the n e w
Chairman, every success for next year.
H O W E V E R , if you think that there's no life
left in this year's officers, you couldn't be more
wrong, because we also found out at the
meeting that we've raised just over £18,000 and
with that magic number 20,000 within our
grasp, we just couldn't resist it.
SO, on Saturday 14th June there will be a
Final Fling Collection, giving y o u your last
c h a n c e this y e a r to d o y o u r bit for an
extremely worthwhile cause. The collection will
be run from all C C U offices, with a 'Life oi
Brian' theme (although you can do any other
stunt if you like) and there will be a free party
in the evening for everyone who has helped.
But if you can't be there on the day, don't
just put it out of your mind — there are plenty
of other ways of making money, whether its a
sponsored event by your club, society or Hall,
selling Rag Mags or a small collections: around
the departmental staff perhaps, or just round a
few local pubs when out with your mates (you
could even have a sponsored revision!). Really
there are lots of ways in which you can have
fun and raise money at the same time, so if
you want to help, please contact me via IC
Union Office, or your C C U , and we'll supply
cans, licences, sponsor forms or anything else
you need. P L E A S E , P L E A S E , P L E A S E think
about it, and make an effort — even if you
only collect for half an hour you'll be helping us
to help up to about twenty more deaf children
this year.
