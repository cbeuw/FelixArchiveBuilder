College is for study
or Profits?
S o m e of the visiting F r e n c h schoolkids,
on campus to eat in Southside, tried to
set fire to car roofs and the ladies toilet
over the long weekend. Furthermore, the
commotion caused was again unacceptable
at a time of revision just prior to exams.
O v e r the past weeks the number of
t h e s e p a r t i e s , w i t h a n age r a n g e of
t h i r t e e n t o s e v e n t e e n , h a s i n c r e a s e d
rapidly. Whilst they may be staying in a
nearby hotel during their sight-seeing trip
to L o n d o n , t h e y eat t h e i r l u n c h a n d
evening meals here. T h e arrangement is
t h r o u g h S c o m p a n y w h i c h p r i n t s a n d
distributes Diners C a r d s to the continent.
A card gives the holder food to the value
of £1.25 in the Southside Refectory.
T h e scheme was introduced some time
a g o i n o r d e r t o i n c r e a s e r e f e c t o r y
revenue. H o w e v e r , for those in Southside
the situation became intolerable.
Since the beginning of term there have
been 150 or so eating their meals here.
T w o problems arise. Firstly at lunchtime
large queues of kids stretched to the door
of the refectory, immediately putting off
I C students who would have eaten there.
(Some of the refectory staff tried to see
that students went first.) In the evening,
w i t h t h e p a r t i e s o f t e n u n s u p e r v i s e d ,
Southside became a playground. O n c e
inside they ran up a n d d o w n the stairs to
the annoyance of, amongst others, the
security guard. Outside in the car park
area and beside the mews tens of kids let
off steam after a day c o o p e d up in the
coach. This lead to an unpredicted level
of c o m p l a i n t s f r o m s t u d e n t s to t h e
wardens, sub wardens and U n i o n . It has
a l s o l e d t o f r i c t i o n w i t h t h e M e w s
residents, one even went to the extent of
taking photos.
T h e Refectory Suggestions Committee
r a i s e d t h e m a t t e r at t h e R e f e c t o r y -
C o m m i t t e e . T h e problem was not under-
stood by those who did not k n o w the
facts a n d of course the 'profit' from these
kids was the over-riding factor. A n y w a y
t h e y d e c i d e d it w o u l d be a g o o d i d e a
asking the kids to be quiet! T h e same day
the evening commotion lasted until nine
o'clock. The F r e n c h teachers complained
to the r e f e c t o r y staff w h i l s t t h e i r k i d s
played havoc with those revision time-
t a b l e s . M a t t e r s w e r e left w i t h t w o
m e m b e r s of the R e f e c t o r y C o m m i t t e e
who tried to keep order.
Since then the U n i o n C o u n c i l decided
that "no profit making venture must be at
the expense of normal life" a n d that
includes revision in one's room. This is
in line w i t h the P r a t t R e p o r t of s o m e
years back, written after complaints from
t e c h n i c i a n s that c o n f e r e n c e b o o k i n g s
w e r e u p s e t t i n g t h e i r o w n r e f e c t o r y
outlets. T h e Union's letter to D r R C
Schroter demanded that the scheme be
dropped or that alternative arrangements
be made. • It also pointed out that there
were other ways that the prices could be
brought d o w n , which were not against the
ruling of the Pratt Report.
M r M o o n e y and D r Schroter have been
endeavouring to develope a solution to
the problem which will be acceptable to
us. T o this end a number of actions have
been taken:
1. No bookings between 1st and 13th
June have been accepted. We are
committed, however, to a couple on the
5th and 6th June. We are also commited
to a considerable number during the last
week of May.
2. Mr Mooney has agreed that, with the
exception of the weekend times and
provided there is no clash with the dinner
bookings in the Sherfield Building, both
lunches and dinners will be served to the
visitors in the Sherfield Building rather
than Southside. It is unfortunately not
possible to use this approach on the
weekends for obvious reasons.
3. The Central Organisers and the
Party Organisers have been, and are
being, repeatedly contacted to warn them
of the importance of decorous behaviour
and a letter has been produced in French
which is given to each tour party leader
instructing them exactly what to do.
4. Finally, at the Refectory's expense
student marshalls are being sort for to
help control the students.
A t the t i m e of w r i t i n g it is u n c l e a r
e x a c t l y h o w s u c c e s s f u l the s c h e m e is
from a student viewpoint. It is after all
necessary for a member of the refectory
staff to go over to Southside and marshall
them to Sherfield and one can never be
sure when they will turn up. S o there is
an extra burden on the staff a n d the necessity
to open Sherfield in the evenings. This
means a decrease in the 'profit' margin,
but on this point it should be said that no
figures have been present to show that
this 'profit' is absolutely necessary.
S o a f t e r t h r e e w e e k s of h a s s l e s it
seems that College have accepted that
College life comes first and the responsi-
bility for the guest falls o n those w h o
invite a guest into College.
T h r e e w e e k s w h i c h l e d t o m u c h
complaints, extra work for the wardens in
Selkirk a n d K e o g h , a n d trouble for the
S u b - w a r d e n s w h o t r i e d to c o n t r o l the
childish actions of a small minority of our
students, and a serious threat of arson.
Hopefully sanity has now returned and
that this is a lesson to many. F o r we all
u n d e r s t a n d that n o n - a c a d e m i c services
must not lose College money, but this
should not be at the expense of academic
a n d acceptable college life. Failure of the
refectories to realise the difficulties did
put a question mark o n many things.
H o w e v e r , what happens now is some-
what unclear, D r R C Schroter hopes
that "the actions taken will both relieve
the tension between residents and others,
and will retain some means of raising
funds to help underwrite catering costs."
A f t e r a l l , h i s t a s k is a d i f f i c u l t a n d
vertually impossible one.
M r M o o n e y is quoted as saying: the
trouble it brings, it just isn't worth it."
