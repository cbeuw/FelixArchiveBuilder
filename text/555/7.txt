IC 1st XI vs Borough Road
IC got off to a good start with some
aggressive umpiring by Salter who called
every other ball a wide! As the extras score
raced along, Guy Simpkins and Andy
Harris played some attacking strokes. After
Simpkin was dismissed for 22, Harris took
control of the innings and soon reached 50.
He continued playing with devil and
panache and punished the bowling to
reach his century in less than 100 minutes
before finally being dismissed for 110,
which included 14 fours and a six. Harris
was ably supported by Eckersley (21) and
Maquire (12no). At tea, IC declared at 200
for 6.
Borough Road, showing ail the aggress-
iveness of a stuffed parrot, made no
attempt to chase IC's total. Their negative
approach to the game ensured a long and
boring innings which, at the close of play,
stood at 77 for 5. However, the IC bowlers
were unlucky not to bowl-out the agri-
culturally-minded Borough Road hackers.
Ratnam took 1 for 23 for 15 off 9 and
Simpkin was unfortunately unable to
purchase a wicket with his daisy cutters.
Result: a moral victory to IC by a wide
margin!

Dear Colin
T h o u g h I m a y have b e c o m e
short-tempered while revising, I feel
that it is still a quite reasonable
reaction to be enraged by a number
of posters I have seen about the
college. The thin end of the wedge
was a poster depicting a mushroom
cloud rising from a cooling tower.
H o w subtle! What breath-taking
imagery! Close study revealed that
the power station using the towers
was not included in the picture.
Circumstantical evidence would
suggest that the h i d d e n p o w e r
station was not nuclear. D u m b
posters do not contribute to the
nuclear debate. I heartily congra-
tulate whoever took any of them
down.
T o d a y I s a w a n even worse
example. Published by Ecoropa, it
is called "Nuclear Power — T h e
Facts". A lively little poster, it has a
short introduction and then twenty-
three questions and answers. T h e
intro hints that the nuclear industry
is a conspiracy of psychopathic
faceless businessmen out to poison
as many people as they can while
being paid lots of money to build
engines of distruction (or power
stations as the non-ecologically
minded sometimes call them). A r e
the m e n of B N F L a n d U K A E A
freemasons? O r perhaps illuminati?
O f the t w e n t y - t h r e e q u e s t i o n s
which follow, numbers 22 and 23
are answered quite reasonably.
T h e rest a r e a n s w e r e d with a
patchwork of irrelevancy, answers
which mislead by telling some of
the truth but not all of it, and the
occasional statement which is just
not true. Some answers are cunning,
others insult the intelligence of the
reader. I will not go into details, so
as to shorten the letter (already
overlong), but will in a subsequent
letter if whoever put the post up
writes an answer to this letter in
FELIX.
Perhaps he or she is the same
person who put up poster number
3. It is titled "Studies of the Human
A u r a " and is a hideous example of
the reconciliation of Biblical funda-
mentalism with m o d e r n science
s c h o o l of thought. I n e e d n o t
describe it in detail, as they have
proliferated around College like an
intellectual cancer. It appears to
refer to the relation between the
S C A B A G M
At the S C A B A G M on Tuesday,
the election for Chairman was very
closely contended between Nick
Moran and Fiona Sinclair, the post
being w o n by F i o n a . Nick then
stood down to the post of Treasurer.
David Britton was unopposed as
Secretary.

Imperial Opera
LA BELLE HELENE
by J Offenbach
Last week I C was the venue for the first performance of a n
authentic version of Offenbach's La Belle H6l&ne, ie, a version
different from that usually performed. T h e latter contains material
f r o m o t h e r o p e r e t t a s b y t h e c o m p o s e r . Imperial O p e r a
presented the original score with a n e w translation by Geoffrey
D u n n , which (I a m assured) is faithful to the original, a n d in
places quite hilarious. T h e plot c o n c e r n s , o n its surface, t h e
events leading up t o the T r o j a n W a r , but is in fact a satire o n
decadent Parisian society in the 1860s, with a High Priest cheating
at cards and a n Orestes surrounded by ladies of doubtful virtue
(not including his sister). the humour in the lines. M i k e
Imperial Opera is a c o m p a n y Withers d i d the honours with
newly-formed by current a n d

Society, mostly graduates of I C
or various music colleges. In
fact, a group of very talented
and experienced singers a n d
musicians. There was sufficient
vocal talent to 'double-up' the
