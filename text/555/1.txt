Appeal from C C U
Presidents
Dear Sir,
We write to you concerning the
abhorrent act that was committed last
week in Southside. It is very distressing to
find that such an act can be perpetrated
within the earshot of many students.
We, ourselves, having a close ear to
the Union grapevine and also the feelings
of the non-Union hack student, find that
the feelings within IC and ICU are no
more than "concerned". ANY political
action, political fervour or political
leanings, motivates some student(s) into
writing to FELIX, speaking at UGMs,
printing endless reams of international
statistics but when a vile act is committed
against one of our fellow students, how
many people have beenactivelyconcerned?
What have College been doing about it?
Action is required now; not in a few days
time, not in a few weeks or months but
now.
The question raised last week relating
to the security arrangements and the
numerous entrances into Southside will
take months to solve. Even now entrances
are left open to anybody. Surely this
comes under the umbrella of security
patrol which seems to be non-existent.
The attacker must be stopped immediately.
The description was in last week's FELIX
and this is where you (staff and students
alike) can help.
i) Were you ever in Southside on
Saturday night?
ii) Did you ever travel in the Falmouth-
Tizard lifts on Saturday night?
iii) Did you notice the attacker in the bar
at any time during the evening?
iv) Did you see the assailant in the
locality at all?
Even if your answers are negative, they
help build up a positive picture of the
events. Please, please write in with ANY
information to the IC Union Office.
These obscene acts must be stopped at
all costs, so make a concerted effort to
free the ladies of this college of a most
terrifying and evil experience.
Please help.
Yours sincerely
Bernie Pryor
