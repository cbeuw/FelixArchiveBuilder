the work done at IC is for industry
and so is not published as widely, and
is often credited to the sponsor.
The Rector has said that he intends
to fight the cuts by inviting
industrialists and journalists to
College to gain their financial and
moral support. It is thought that such
an audience will be more sympathetic
to the department and its 'applied'
style.
Attempts are also being made to
lobby MPs.
Student
recovering
Neil McKenzie, the Microbiology
second year student suffering from
meningitis, is recovering slowly in St
Mary's Hospital. The illness has left
Mr McKenzie paralysed in one leg
and deaf, but a hospital doctor said
he is hopeful that the deafness will be
temporary.
Anyone who knows Mr McKenzie
is very welcome to visit him at any
time during the next fortnight, in the
Samuel Lane Ward in St Mary's
Hospital. He will then be moved to
another hospital for at least three
months.
Mr McKenzie will now take a year
out from his course, sitting his exams
next summer.
Syd attacked
Union President Sydney Harbour-
Bridge was said to be in a stable
condition last night after an ex-student
attacked him with a pint of iced water
in the Union Bar. The student was
asked to leave immediately after the
incident by Union Bar supremo
Adrian 'Jelly' Johnson.
The ex-student. Ms Sunny Bains,
told FELIX that she felt the urge to
pour her drink over the President after
he had refused to talk to her earlier
that day.
