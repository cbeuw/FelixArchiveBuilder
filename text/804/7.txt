Death
(Cert PG)
To say that this comedy thriller is
typically formatted is something of an
understatement. If you've seen Death
on the Nile, Evil Under the Sun or
Muder on the Orient Express then you
could well claim to have seen this film
also.
In the usual style of Agatha Christie
there is a murder and too many
suspects to count on one hand.
Amongst all this is Hercule Poirot
spotting the clues and sifting through
to identify the culprit. As you expect
he does this with all the pleasance and
humour evident in his previous cases
and the Belgian's portrayal by Peter
Ustinov is predictably good.
The supporting cast boasts no less
than seven other major stars, and with
such strong competition, none of them
have a chance to steal the show, from
each other or from Ustinov.
Particularly good is Piper Laurie
(Carrie, Children of a Lesser God) as
the wicked Mrs Emily Boynton, the
obligatory murder victim. So
convincing is Laurie that I couldn't
wait for her to die. Equally proficient
is Sir John Gielgud, providing
Poirot's necessary sidekick for the
investigation, in the form of Colonel
Carbury. Ustinov and Gielgud are
funny together, and undoubtedly the
highlight of the film.
The picture falls short of the mark
in two respects. Firstly, the initial
scene-setting is too vague and drawn
out. producing a sense of boredom
about the whole thing. Then having
reached the murder, collected the
clues and rounded up the suspects for
his typically dramatic revelation at the
end, Poirot lets us all down by giving
a poor motive for each of the
innocents and leaving the audience in
no doubt as to the identity of the
murderess a good ten minutes too
soon. In short there is no tension in
the film, and that surely is the most
important element in a thriller.
What the film has going for it, aside
from Gielgud, Laurie and Ustinov, is
the pleasant backdrop of 1937
Palestine. The director Michael
Winner (Death Wish, The Wicked
Lady) makes full use of the locations,
from desert to casbah to ocean liner,
and had the characters been more
convincing I might have believed they
were really on holiday there.
Appointment with Death is a
pleasant film, quite entertaining if not
exciting. It has the trademarks of the
production-line company that Cannon
have become through churning out
pictures to fill its cinema screens, and
as a result you'll probably prefer to
read the book.

All About Eve
This must have been the worst All
About Eve gig I have ever been to.
After losing my tickets, I finally got
in due to the kind management,
missing the first five minutes. I don't
think I missed much though. The slow
ones were okay, but it was the others
that missed. They didn't nudge
bottoms as they usually do,
particularly In The Clouds and In the
Meadow. Perhaps it was the venue,
(filled with record company guests
etc, just sitting there, destroying the
atmosphere). Give me the Astoria or
Marquee any day of the week.
Fields of the Nephilim
Town & Country Club, May 18.
The Nephilim are a strange bunch:
with cowboy hats and dark glasses,
they appear to be very similar to The
Sisters of Mercy. Also, their vocalist,
Carl, has the same growl and I could
hear very few of the words sung
tonight. However, the Nephilim also
play hard and fast, with their set
containing many new songs,
including their new single Moonchild.
It was when their older songs
emerged that the air was filled with
'snakey' arm movements and people
sitting and standing on other people's
shoulders.
It was absolutely brilliant.
