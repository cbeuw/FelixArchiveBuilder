Unwanted
rot
Cynical people used to suggest that
car manufacturers deliberately
designed their cars to rust so that
people would have to buy more cars.
The same attitude in the textile
industry was satirised in the old
British film Tlie Man in the White
Coat where Alec Guinness plays a
scientist who invents an indestructable
fabric: the work force of the company
refused to adopt the idea because they
thought it would leave them without
future jobs. Their attitude appears to
be mirrored by the book trade who
seem to design their products to
disintegrate after a set period of time.
The average paperback; even if
looked after well, will fall to bits in
ten years. This may be OK if the book
is a Jackie Collins novel, but it is
hardly acceptable if it is a textbook
and contains useful information. Our
stocks of scientific journals become
consulted less frequently as they get
older, but many still must be kept on
open access in case some vital result
is unavailable anywhere else. If they
crumble to dust, vital information
may be lost forever.
The problem is actually a relatively
modern one. Sometime in the 1850s
paper makers discovered cheap ways
to turn wood-pulp into acceptable
paper. This turned out to be
considerably cheaper than cotton-rag.
However, the machinery used for
pulping the wood left the wood fibres
too short (this lowers the structural
integrity of the resultant paper) and
the chemical processing of the pulp
left the resulting paper acidic.
Another part of the paper-making
process placed another time bomb in
the paper: one of the chemical
additives decomposes with time to
give even more acid. The acid eats
into the structure of the cellulose in
the wood fibres, making them brittle.
These problems are exacerbated by
the moisture from people's fingers,
air pollution, unfiltered sunlight,
central heating.
These factors turn most modern
books into brittle fragile objects after
a few decades. Really old books
(published before about 1800) are still
going strong and don't deteriorate
unless they are handled too much.
Libraries that want to maintain their
modern books have a big problem.
They could put them all on microfilm,
but this is inconvenient and
6
expensive. So they have been
searching for chemical methods of
preserving the original bits of paper.
One solution involves neutralising
the acids present in the original paper.
This is easy for paper-makers to do
since they can actually incorporate
other chemicals into the original paper
that neutralise acid as it is formed. But
publishers tend not to do this since it
costs more. So libraries need to get
a method to retrospectively protect
cheap book paper.
One chemical method developed
for the American Library of Congress
involves a spontaneously flammable
chemical called triethyl aluminium.
This may sound paradoxical, but the
chemical's reactivity is the key to its
success. The books are placed in a
closed chamber, the air is removed
and replaced by the volatile chemical.
The chemical slowly penetrates the
paper, reacting with anything
remotely acidic and leaving enough
alkali to neutralise any future acid
penetration. The excess chemical is
removed under vacuum before letting
the air back in.
Unfortunately, this method works
best on new books and does nothing
for those already halfway to dust. So,
the British Library commissioned
chemists at Surrey University to
develop a better method. They came
up with something that both preserves
and strengthens paper.
Again the books have to be
impregnated with the preservative
molecules, in this case ethyl acrylate
and methyl methacrylate (perspex is
a polymer of methyl methacrylate).
An antacid can also be added. The
books are then irradiated with gamma
rays which cause the chemicals to
polymerise and to react with the
cellulose. This strengthens the paper
by up to ten times, vastly increasing
its durability. If the cocktail of
chemicals is mixed well the the
process causes no noticable change to
the texture of the paper.
Unfortunately it can cost £ 5 0 per
book. If mass processing can get this
down to about £ 6 per book then the
method would be competitive with the
American solutions (and it can be
used on partly degraded books).
However, there is one good thing
about paper rot: the junk mail that fills
up my letter rack will eventually
crumble to dust.
New hope
for fatties
Beecham Pharmaceuticals have
discovered the ultimate slimming pill.
It encourages certain cells to burn
excess food to produce heat. This
should be sheer joy for addicts of
Cadbury and Mac Donalds.
Chemicals such as adrenaline
(produced by the body in times of
stress to make you ready to fight or
run away) have been known to
encourage useless fat burning for a
long time, but they tend to give you
heart attacks as well. Beechams
chemists performed the trick of
building a similar molecule which
only caused heat generation without
cardiac acceleration. And the
molecule can be taken as a pill (unlike
adrenaline and its natural relatives).
Unfortunately for the fatties,
Beechams don't want to sell the drug
or put it through full clinical trials.
They say the market is too small. This
might be true in worldwide terms, but
the British obesity market is huge (no
pun intended) and someone is sure to
take the sales job up.
Left-hands
die young
About one in ten people are left-
handed. This small percentage makes
it easy for the rest of us to ignore
them. So left-handed implements are
few and far between and the poor
southpaws are made to feel they are
in a persecuted minority. They used
to comfort themselves with the
knowledge that at least God liked
them, but this had now been shown
to be untrue: apparently he had made
them so that they die young.
It has been known for some time
that there appears to be a decrease in
the percentage of left-handers in older
populations. This might be explained
by a previous generation of teachers
who forced young children to write
with their right hands, but left-
handedness is impossible to
completely eradicate. On the other
hand there is some evidence that some
diseases are more likely to attack left-
handers (allergies and immune system
problems are common).
To get some hard evidence on
longevity differences, Diane Halpern
and Stanley Coren (California State
University and University of British
Columbia) decided to look at The
Baseball Encyclopaedia where dates
of birth and death and throwing hand
are all recorded. Their evidence
confirms that right-handers live
longest. Average life-expectancies are
about one year less for the poor
sinistrals (useless historical fact: our
word sinister comes from the Latin
for left and reflects the medieval
suspicion of the unusual). The
differences appear to be statistically
significant by conventional tests.
Mortality rates appear to be the
same until about the age of 35. From
then on about two percent more left-
handers bite the dust than right-
handers each year.
Why should the poor sinistrals
suffer this (slightly) speedier fate? It
might be because they are genetically
inferior to the rest of us. On the other
hand (no pun intended) it is possible
that most of the difference is
accounted for by the greater
likelihood of accidents in a world
designed for right-handers. So the fact
that left-handed scissors are difficult
to find in the shops may actually be
killing people. It's not that they are
inferior, it's just that right-handers are
in the majority.
