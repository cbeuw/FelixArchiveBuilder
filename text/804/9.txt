TENNIS
London Cup:
Imperial College 2nd team—1
L S E - 2
This was the London intercollegiate
tournament quarter final, and due to
the format of only three rubbers,
immediately required winning from
from the three pairs. Unfortunately,
since this was the first second team
match of the season, the form was
slow to come.
Our first pair, K Cheung and J Van
Vlyman went down 6-2 6-1 to the
LSE first pair, which contained a
German who was 'as hot as s**f
(quote from J Van Vlyman). The
second pair of M Lavelle and V
Buttereit lost 6-3 6-1 to their opposite
number while the third pair of
Termanini and Harrison had a shaky
start but won 1-6 6-2 6-2 to restore
a little pride to the team.
The second team is still in the UAU
so we may taste success yet...watch
this space!
On Sunday May 22 IC were playing
the University of East Anglia at
Norwich. After surviving Vk hours
of Andy Hill's driving IC knew it was
their lucky day. IC, having arrived 2
hours late (funny that happened last
year), found U E A In a very
determined mood. Andy Hill and
Mark Lavelle, obviously still shakey
from the journey lost a close first
match to the UEA first couple. Julian
Jones and John Roberts won their first
match comfortably against the U E A
3 rd pair whilst Paul Skipworth and
Mike Morces had an excellent victory
6-2. 7-6 against the UEA 1st pair. So
3-3 going into the final round IC
needed to win 2 out of the remaining
3 matches. Although battling well Hill
and Lavelle lost very quickly 6-0, 6-1,
putting a lot of pressure on Jones and
Roberts to beat the UEA 1st pair.
Playing like men inspired they
succeeded winning 7-5, 6-3. This left
Skipworth and Morcos with the
relatively easy task of beating the
UEA third pair. Through numerous
double faults and general poor play
they lost the first set 6-4. They
struggled to win the second 6-4 and,
finding themselves 4-2 down in the
final set, needed inspiration. This
came from their team-mates and
playing some excellent tennis they
took the next 4 games to win 6-4. This
excellent victory leaves IC unbeaten
in the U A U so far. IC look forward
to reaching the national quarter finals
on Wednesday against Sussex.
Thanks to Hill for some excellent
driving.
ICCAG
Van drivers needed
We will be continuing with the soup
run every Thursday night over the
summer holidays and are suffering
from a severe shortage of Union Van
Drivers. We leave from Week's Hall
Basement (17 Prince's Gardens) at
9.30pm and get back at about 11pm
having handed out our quota of tea,
sandwiches, etc. and enjoyed a good
gossip with residents of Lincoln's Inn
and the Embankment.
The playgroup will also be carrying
on every fortnight and our activities
so far include Kate's rendition of a
mad cat and Nicola's guitar selling
ability. Who knows what is to come?!
Jobsquad and a variety of voluntary
work is available in or out of London
at all times and if anyone is interested
then I have all the details.
So if you want a more varied
summer holiday or if you are a hard
working postgrad. Without a summer
holiday then please get in touch with
me via the ICCAG pigeonhole in the
Union Office or my own in
Computing.

FELIX
ACING
Next week sees the big flat race of the
season, the Ever Ready Derby. Being
run at Epsom this year, it promises
to be a great race over the classic 1 Vi
miles. The present going is fast,
which should favour the likes of
Unfuwain and Minster Son, but the
running of the new favourite Red
Glow will be something of a mystery.
He pulled out all the stops when
beating Keefah, Glacial Storm and
IC RADIO
As seen in last week's FELIX, we do
have a show every Monday at 8am
and Wednesday at 1pm. And our
jingle machine is a human called
Dangle Pringle, the amazing
bilingual human jingle machine'.
There will also be a sports review,
weather report, Miles' Handy Tips,
Letters Page, Chrissie FELIX,
Dangle. Random Call and Phil, Anna-
Marie and Fez.
Sanquiro in the Mecca —Dante at
York. That was on good ground, but
He struggled when failing to Minster
Son in April. However, Red Glow is
by the great Nijinsky, and I believe
that he can win on Wednesday, with
The Charmer, who was running on
well when second to Doyoun in the
2000 Guineas, following him past the
post.
Recently, Minizen Lass has clocked
up a hat-trick of good wins under
penalty, and may well be running in
one of the class races later this season.
Diminuendo was travelling well when
winning at York against reasonable
opposition, and looks good for the
Oaks on June 4th. Siesta Key also won
easily when beating one-time Derby
hopeful Alkharif by 6 lengths at Bath.
The other Derby looming is the
Daily Mirror Greyhound Derby on
June 25th. This promises to be a great
contest between Curryhills Gara,
Summerhill Gem and Fearless Ace.
Heats began on Tuesday night, and
continue on THursday and Saturday.
Odds at present are 16-1, 14-1 and
20-1 respectfully, but I feel that
Killouragh Chris at 33 -1 represents
good each-way value.
Having stuck my neck out, I hope
that you will be stacking a little of
your grant on the Derby, and we'll
see next week if I was right.
Cookery Club
A gastronomic
survey of the world
Nigerian
Connection
This week we go off the beaten track
to take a brief look at the dishes of
Nigeria. I am grateful to John
Durodola of Mech Eng for providing
me with an interesting discourse on
Nigerian cuisine. He made every dish
sound tantalising.
The gastronomic jewel—'Moin-
Moin' (pronouced with the n's silent).
This is a special steamed dish in
which soaked, ground beans are
cooked in a tomato and chilli sauce.
Shrimps, fish or liver can be added.
I would savour the taste of this dish
accompanied by plain boiled rice.
John told me of a Swiss lady visiting
Nigeria who became enthralled by its
taste and took a recipe back to her
home town where it took root as a
'piece de resistance' in the local
cuisine.
Pepper Soup (very common in East
Nigeria)—This soup is eaten with
nothing to follow. One simply has the
soup, drinks some water and wanders
off. The local Nigerian herbs impart
the kidney, liver and meat broth with
properties that are reputed to keep the
piles at bay. This soup is an institution
in the country and must be tried.
'Fura & Nono' (North Nigeria)—
John insists that there is nothing more
soothing to drink in the fierce heat of
the Nigerian sun than this preparation
of fresh milk (nono) and ground corn
(fura)
Dodo—This is a dish made by frying
plantains over a low flame. It is
usually eaten with rice or beans in an
onion, tomato and chilli sauce.
'Alewa'—A sweet made from sugar
cane that is worth trying.
The Great Tuber Dishes
Anyone who has lived in West Africa
knows the importance of tubers as a
staple, food. The yam or the cassava
base is always accompanied by a soup
with vegetables and meat added. The
choice of base is usually either
pounded yams, 'Amala' (made from
yam powder), 'Eba' or 'Gari' (made
from cassava flour) or 'Futu' (made
from cassava flour). Amongst the
choice of soups to accompany the
starch base one can expect to find
Egusi soup (a major ingredient is a
special Nigerian Melon) and Okra
soup.
Places to eat in Lagos
Tam-Tam on Broad Street, behind
Leventis Stores.
Restaurant Museum Kitchen, Tafa-
Balewa Square. The Tinubu Square
area is a good place to find good
cuisine at affordable prices.
Traditional Lagos food can be tried
in the Isale-Eko area and in the Race
Course area.
Inexpensive evening meals may be
enjoyed in a number of 'Bukaterias'
on Awoiowo Road in Ikoyi even
though this is a posh area of the city.
What Next?
The gastronomic survey will be taking
a look at eating in Athens, Italy and
America as soon as I have received
enough to write about.
Bye, Yishu.
