This weekend sees the start of the
Formula One North American mini
series, probably the toughest month
of the year, with three hard races and
no return to base.
Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix is
followed in two weeks time by the
Canadian event with Detroit on June
19th. The Circuito Hermanos
Rodreiguez, just outside Mexico City,
is a 2.7 mile medium speed circuit
with a twisty back section and a long
start/finish straight entered from a
banked 180° corner. The surface is
notoriously abrasive and mid-race
tyre changes should be the order of
the day. Perhaps the most interesting
topic will be not who wins but what
the TV coverage is like. At Rio, the
direction was its usual appalling
standard, the technical quality bad and
the BBC only showed highlights.
Things improved markedly for Imola
where RAI provided excellent
pictures but the BBC goofed badly by
showing the race half an hour after
it had finished (much to the
amusement of Radio 2). For Monaco,
the BBC decided to show the whole
race truly live but were let down by
the poor direction from the
Monagasques. The situation this
weekend is likely to be even worse.
As the football World Cup showed,
the Mexican TV service is not
technically brilliant and the directors
simply do not have enough motor
racing experience. An added
disadvantage this year is the loss of
the in-car cameras, mounted last year
on the Lotus of Satoru Nakajima and
the Brabham of Andrea de Cesaris.
The French manufacturers of the
cameras, the Thomson electronics
company, want their name displayed
on the screen when the camera is
used, in much the same way that the
Formula One timekeepers Longines-
Olivetti get a credit for any timing
information. However, the other
sponsors won't allow this so Thomson
have withdrawn die* cameras.
Onto the race itself. McLaren lost
valuable test mileage when they had
to return straight home from Monaco
to repair Ayrton Senna's badly
damaged car rather than heading for
Monza like many other teams. Having
already destroyed one car this year,
Senna is probably not the McLaren
team's favourite driver at the
moment. Ferrari enjoyed a bit of a
revival at the Monte Carlo, finishing
second and third, but this is not
entirely unexpected given that their
private test track, Fiorano, is similar
in character to the principality's
streets. Williams finally scored a 1988
World Championship point when
Riccardo Patrese finished sixth. The
continued overheating problems of
the Judd engine are hardly likely to
be helped by the Mexican heat.
Predictions: Senna to win, Thierry
Boutsen (Benetton) top atmo.
Meanwhile, in the States, the
world's biggest sporting event will be
taking place—the Indianapolis 500
miles. Qualifying was dominated by
the three Penske PC 17 Chevrolets
who occupy the front row. Pole
position goes to Rick Mears with a
four lap qualifying average of
219mph! Lining up alongside him are
team mates and fellow former
winners Danny Sullivan and Al Unser
Sr. Fourth is my tip for victory,
Mario Andretti, the 1978 Formula
One World Champion, going for his
second win at Indy. Other possible
winners include Al Unser Jr, Michael
Andretti (son of Mario), Dutchman
Arie Luyendijk and Emerson
Fittipaldi, another former World
Champion.
Elsewhere, at Dijon, France, Briton
Steve Soper looks set to continue his
dominance of the European Touring
Car Championship in his Ford Sierra
Cosworth RS500, having won three
of the four rounds already held.
Highlights of the Mexican GP will
be on 'Grand Prix' on Sunday night
with Indy hopefully to be shown later.
Next week: Silverstone F3000,
British F3 and Touring Cars.
Live on
Arrival
Four of the most talented alternative
comedians come together late on
Saturday evenings for the next two
weeks. Steve Punt, Flip Webster,
Guy Jackson and Hugh Dennis
entertain with a mix of sketches,
satire, songs and sometimes painful
observations on society. Billed as
'Your laugh in their hands', Live on
Arrival appear at the Paris Theatre,
opposite the Plaza Cinima off
Piccadilly Circus. Doors are open
11.00— 11.10pm, and the show is free
but collect tickets earlier in the
evening to be sure of a seat. If you
can't make it, you can listen live on
Radio 4 from 11.30pm, although this
loses much of the sparkle of a live
performance. Highly recommended.
