WUS not W U S -
Where did your quid go?
Imperial College Union is a member of the World University
Service (WUS), an educational charity which works for
economic and social justice in the Third World. Last term,
ICU decided to sponsor a Third World student on a course
which would be appropriate to the developing needs of his/her
native country, following the initiative of last year's President
Christine Taig. The money for that student's transport, living
costs, fees and residence was to be found by the Union and
the College.
The student arrived in this country
nine years ago as part of the
Westernisation Programme of the
Shah of Iran. Since the revolution in
his home country, he managed to
continue his education by working
illegally and gaining support from his
parents in Teheran.
He was eventually thrown out of
College accommodation because he
could not pay his hall bills and spent
three months living with Mr Harbour-
Bridge in Linstead Hall.
In February, the Warden of
Montpelier Hall and a close personal
friend, Kevin O'Connor, managed to
persuade a company to sponsor the
student for a sum of £7,000 to pursue
Originally College administration
were keen to establish a South African
Scholarship under the WUS scheme
but it was realised that it could not be
up and running until the academic
year 1989/90. Union President
Sydney Harbour-Bridge (name
changed in aid of Comic Relief) was
keen to see some other student gain
benefit from the Scheme before he left
College.
Three stages had to be completed
before the WUS Scholarship could
come into operation: a rent-free place
in a hall of residence had to be
negotiated: some means of
maintenance had to be arranged; and
tuition fees had to be paid for by some
means or waived by College.
The first stage was relatively easy
to accomplish. The Union agreed to
guarantee one of the sixteen Union
places in residence to the WUS
student and Mr Harbour-Bridge got
agreement at a Union General
Meeting that the College Residence
Account should pay for the room. He
explained that just a pound on
everybody's rent each year would
enable a Third World student to come
to Imperial.
The second stage has been more
difficult to achieve. Mr Harbour-
Bridge proposed that ICU Charity
Rag should adopt the student as one
of their supported charities each year.
He believed that this would be the best
way to pay for such a student's living
costs. But nobody showed up to argue
the WUS case at this year's Rag
Annual General Meeting and the
charity wasn't adopted.
The third stage is entirely up to the
College departments who have been
asked to waive their fees.
Despite the stage two hiccups,
everything seemed to be going quite
smoothly. In February, the Student
Residence Committee (SRC) agreed
that the Residence Account would pay
for a room in hall. It was decided that
a postgraduate student would live in
Montpelier Hall and an undergraduate
would take the first year in a shared

room in Evelyn Gardens followed by
the remaining years in Beit Hall. It
was also agreed that it would be
effective from the point when the
Union managed to support a student
nominated by WUS. Each student
would have their case reassessed
every six months and be expected to
be of good academic standing at the
end of each year.
One significant decision that was
made by the SRC was that they did
not specify that the sponsorship had
to be for a South African. The reason
stated to the WUS was that they did
not want to be tied down to South
Africans, who may not necessarily be
a needy group in the future. WUS
agreed that the scholarship could
'potentially be availablefor any WUS
nominates'.
It was shortly after the SRC
meeting that Mr Harbour-Bridge
decided that the 'free' room he had
secured by U G M could be used this
year for 'a needy case'. He nominated
an Iranian MPhil student in the Civil
Engineering Department.
further research on journey times in
London. This money was deemed
enough to pay his fees and left around
£1,500 for his living expenses.
Mr Harbour-Bridge persuaded both
College and WUS that as students
were prepared to pay for a Third
World student this year, they would
cover the cost of this student's hall
bills for the next year. He told
members of the SRC that 'the WUS
scheme would enable Mr X to
continue his PhD until this time next
year by which time he will have lived
in this country for ten years and be
able to applyfor residential status and
gain a full work permit'.
However, the Chairman of the SRC
Brian Levitt was unhappy about the
plan. In a letter to the President on
2^nd February, he expressed his
concern about the turn of events: 'A
more fundamental objection is that
SRC agreed, with reluctance, to the
WUS student sponsorship on the basis
that it would be used to bring a
student from a Third World country
to this College to be educated—ie that
the scheme would benefit not merely
the student but the country concerned.
I cannot feel that either SRC or the
Union Council would have agreed
simply to use the money and the place
to help somebody already in College,
or already having received
considerable help from the College
and about whom there must be some
doubt as to whether he will return to
his own country.'
Despite Dr Levitt's objections, Mr
Harbour-Bridge informed members
of the SRC on 25th March that, as
College Secretary and WUS had
agreed to his plan, he had asked the
Accommodation Office to give the
student a place in Montpelier Hall.
At the beginning of this term,
College residents were surprised to
find an extra pound added to their
insurance bill. A letter enclosed with
the bills explained that it was to pay
for a year in residence for a student.
It also gave everyone the opportunity
to reclaim the pound from the Union
Office if they did not agree with the
levy.
FELIX spoke to Dr Levitt
yesterday. He said that he still had
objections to Mr Harbour-Bridge's
methods but realisecTthat the student
was indeed a needy case. He also
emphasised that no student was
obliged to pay the pound if they did
not want to.
