1. Transport'
There has been a Transport
Committee meeting to discuss
amongst other things the two major
problems that I identified in my
Annual Report. These are the
operation of the transport system once
the new job descriptions come into
effect, and the future of the system
if the proposals on PSV licences go
ahead. The first is the most immediate
problem and the second the most
serious. My intention is to hold a
number of meetings and joint
meetings until the problem is solved.
1 should be able to report back to joint
Council .
2. Residence Insurance
For those of you who are interested,
my analysis of the claims on this
policy for the last two years has
thrown up some interesting figures.
1 calculated the claims history for last
year (Aug '86 to July '87) to be £15
218 on a premium of £20 169. This
gave a claims ratio of 75%, which
was too far over the generally
acceptable 60% to avoid a rise in the
premium for this year to £24 097, a
rise of 19%. In order to compare this
year with last, I calculated the claims
history for each year up to the end of
the spring term. For 86/87 this was
£11964 and for 87/88 it was £ 7 8 9 2 ,
a difference of £4072. The portion of
the claims history in 86/87 arising
from keythefts in Linstead was
£3697. The close tally of these figures
is quite remarkable. It seems to be
demonstrated that real improvements
in security can have a real effect on
the premium. The increase in
premium from last year to last would
be about £2 per H 35 408 408 0 0 408

3. Other Insurance
About two years ago, College took
advice to switch all its insurance
policies to be administered by a single
brokers, Alexander Stenhouse LTD.
This advice was also given to
Gutman, but unfortunately wasn't
passed on to myself. With the arrival
of Dave Peacock and the plan to hand
over the administration of Insurance
to him, there is some sense in
following the example of College and
handing over all insurance to one
broker. I am currently talking to
Alexander Stenhouse LTD.
4. Linstead Hall Basement Sale
1 have spoken to yet another loss '
adjuster concerning claims arising
from this incident. I have yet to hear
back from her as to whether there is
a claim against that policy. This
whole matter depresses me as much
as anything this year, with any
progress being painfully slow.
