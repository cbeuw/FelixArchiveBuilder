SNACK BAR MANAGER SACKED
Norman on the dole
Mr Norman Jardine, former Union Catering Manager, was sacked
yesterday afternoon following weeks of uncertainty. Mr Jardine was
told in a letter from Union President Sydney Harbour-Bridge (name
changed in aid of Comic Relief) that he had been dismissed on the
grounds of his mismanagement of the Union Snack Bar. Mr Jardine
told FELIX yesterday night that, because there is no appeal procedure
within College, he will be taking his case directly to an industrial
tribunal.
Norman Jardine—before he was sacked yesterday
Deputy Catering Manager, Mr
Mark Anderson, has been offered a
new contract by the Union. He told
FELIX that if he accepts the offer, he
will be working directly under the
new Union Manager, Mr David
Peacock.
Although Mr Anderson has been
offered a new contract, the Union
Snack Bar will not open until the next
academic year and a professional
catering consultant has been brought
in to help reorganise the trading
outlet.
Mr Anderson told FELIX that he
had only learnt of Mr Jardine's
sacking at 5.00pm last night and was
still making up his mind as to whether
he would sign any new contract. He
said 'I think it's disgusting. I believe
that the whole situation has been
grossly mishandled. There are people
who haven't been brought to answer
for their actions when they should
have been.'
The Union President declined to
comment on the subject when
approached by a FELIX reporter
yesterday afternoon.
Geology
on the
rocks
It has now been confirmed that
the Geology department at IC is
considered to be a second class
department. According to the
University Grants Commission
(UGC) review of earth sciences IC
will lose approximately 80 full
time student places and 10 staff
places. They will also be looked
upon unfavorably in future
allocation of student numbers.
College has unsuccessfully protested
these cuts since April when they were
first announced. Prof Knill, Head of
the Geology Department, is unhappy
about the treatment they received
from the UGC due to remarks made
at one of the review interviews. The
UGC based their decision on what
they felt was insufficient collaboration
between geology and the science
departments. Prof Knill felt that
insufficient weight was given to the
substantial links with the engineering,
and especially mining engineering,
departments on which much of the IC
work is based.
The IC Geology department is one
of the top departments in the country
when it comes to attracting research
contracts. It has suffered from the fact
that academically, IC has not been
seen to be doing enough. Not enough
papers have been published or cited
in the right academic journals, with
the proper credits to IC, to keep them
high in this league table. This could
be attributed to the fact that much of
