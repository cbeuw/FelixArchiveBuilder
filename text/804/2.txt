It's been a jolly little week. It's been
the kind of week when people skip
into the office, give you a cheery grin,
and then hand you a letter slagging
you off. If you want to keep up-to-
date with the latest Union Office
versus FELIX saga then turn straight
to page ten.
The next three weeks' FELICES
will be a little on the thin side due to
a distinct lack of any copy and
collators and that most of you have
better things to do than read FELIX.
Have no fear, I will not be sitting on
my behind during this time as we are
planning a mega-big last issue to
come out on Wedndesday 22nd June.
Don't miss it!
Editorial Freedom
Why is my editorial freedom so
precious to me and to you as members
of this students' union?
Let me tell you a little story. Last
summer Pippa Salmon produced an
excellent Union Handbook to be sent
to all Freshers in September. When
she had finished all the artwork, she
sent photocopies to the Union
Executive for their approval. It's
standard practice. The Executive
were unhappy with several things: the
article on women at IC was too
negative they felt (it was written by
last year's President Christine Taig);
the gay and lesbian article wasn't
sympathetic enough (it was written by
last year's ICU Gay & Lesbian
Welfare Officer): and they believed
that the article on the Union Bar ought
to have been more of an
advertisement for the outlet (it was
written by last year's Internal Services
Officer).
Pippa agreed to make the changes
to the gay and lesbian article,
switched two paragraphs and changed
two sentences in the women at IC
article and allowed the Executive to
re-write the Union Bar article under
protest.
So Freshers read: 'A warm and
friendly if rather dimly lit room, the
Union Bar is a meeting place for
friends or somewhere for a well-
earned drink after a hard day's
lab/problem sheet or sporting day.'
Sounds nice, doesn't it? But it doesn't
sound like the Union Bar I know.
Another thought experiment for
you. Certain Union Officers believe
that all Union activities should be
well-publicised in FELIX by means
of full-page adverts. They say that as
the Union is giving us £11,000 each
year, this service should be free of
charge. This subvention is enough for
an eight page FELIX every Friday.
The reason we can provide bigger
FELICES is because we work hard
for external advertising and the
FELIX staff spend a lot of their spare
time doing money-making external
jobs. So the Union, that's you in
theory, 'owns' eight pages each week.
Let's take a page off for Union
Officer's reports and another for the
weekly diary of events. That's six left
each week. There are over one
hundred clubs and societies. Let's
devote one page to all the clubs and
one page to all the sports. You now
have four pages left. The Union
Office want a full page ad each week
to publicise U G M ' s , regalia,
bookshop and the trading outlets.
Each club publicity officer is
hankering after their .rightful boxed
ad to publicise their special event.
Let's guarantee each club one full
page ad each year. That's a total of
four pages of 'in-house' ads each
week. And that's your own eight page
FELIX.
It sounds all incredibly exciting but
would anybody bother to pick it up
on Fridays—and would anybody want
to take a year out to produce it?
Follow the experiment through to its
logical conclusion—kill the Cat,
create a Union Public
Relations/Communication sabbatical
who produces an information sheet,
runs the Union's Print Unit, does all
the Union's publicity, sits on the
Executive and duplicates Union
minutes in his/her spare time. Life
would be so much easier for all the
Union Officers and College
administrators without the Cat on
their backs: No one to point out their
mistakes, inadequacies, dodgy
dealings and dirty tricks. We would
all be blissfully ignorant about what
was actually happening in College
while we read how super-duper the
Union Snack Bar was and what a nice
guy the President is.
The Union represents students but,
judging by regular attendance at
Union General Meetings, consists of
about 150 people. The Union is too
insular, it doesn't appeal to the
majority. The Union Officers make
decisions for themselves and not the
people they are meant to represent.
However, the FELIX Editor has to
meet the needs of the readership. In
my manifesto I stated that FELIX
ought to inform, entertain and
criticise in order to do its job
properly. I truly believe that FELIX
had done all three things this year.
From the little feedback I do get each
week, most students enjoy reading
FELIX (and all 4000 copies do get
picked up). The only complaints I
ever hear are from a minority in the
Union Office who believe the Libel
page should be replaced by a 'how
wonderful we are' page.
FELIX is for the students, not for
the Union Office, and a good Union
President will use FELIX as a means
of communication without insisting
that the newspaper toes the Union line
on every issue. Every week I have
allocated a page to the Union for
Officer's reports, notices and U G M
ads. It has been severely underused,
except by the Honorary Secretary,
who is the only one who can be
bothered to write anything to inform
you of what he had been doing with
his time (see Annual Reports, 13th
May). I believe this year's FELIX has
allowed adequate exposure to the
Union and its clubs while providing
entertaining articles on a wide range
of student interests. Am I deceiving
myself?
Certain Union Officers seemed
intent at the Annual General Meeting
to waste important time discussing the
need for a FELIX Editor's Annual
Report when we all came to find out
the truth about the Union's trading
outlets. They were concerned that
figures quoted in FELIX were
incorrect, but FELIX can only repeat
what others tell its reporters. What
point is there in FELIX distorting
figures?
The whole argument occured
because I asked the President if he
intended to write an annual report,
and if it would be distributed in
FELIX. Writing a report is part of his
job description. I read it in the Blue
Book (the Union's standing orders
and policy document), so it must be
true!
Why shouldn't the FELIX Editor
write an annual report?
Well, I do! The annual report I
write, however, is presented to
Publications Board and not directly to
a UGM (as are the rest of the reports).
The distinction is that I am not an
Officer of the Union. I make no
Union policy and I have no power in
the running of the Union.
FELIX is financially accountable
through Publications Board which in
turn is accountable to the Union.
Publications Board is a useful buffer.
This is why I let Publication Board
Chair Chris Martin answer questions
asked about FELIX at both Union
Council and UGMs. It is his job. I
have no objections to answering
questions asked directly to me at
UGMs regarding my administration
work as FELIX Editor and Print Unit
Manager. I do object to answering
questions on the content of FELIX.
It is not for Union Officers to decide.
The only power a U G M has over the
FELIX Editor is the ability to censure
or sack. If you think I haven't carried
out my job description then throw me
out, don't alter the nature of FELIX
because of me.
So how do you as a student body
stop me from printing what I like but
nobody else does?
You tell me! That's what we have
a letters page for. (I think it's
appropriate to mention at this point
that I have printed every letter I have
received this year.) It is the letters
page that should be used to point out
inaccuracies, not at a U G M . We
dropped 'The Baron' and its
predecessor for precisely that reason.
Perhaps, Blackmail will go that way
too...
Believe it or not, I am quite a
reasonable sort of person. I don't
print anything which I believe to be
untrue or libellous. It is very easy for
certain Union Officers to accuse me
of lying or deliberately misleading the
student population, but the burden of
proof should lie with them, not me.
Every contentious news story is sub-
edited by two different members of
staff. I discuss major decisions with
them—we bounce ideas off one
another. I'm very lucky that I have
such a good team behind me.
I think that 4000 of you know
exactly what I have been doing with
my time this year. Ask me for an
annual report and I'll hand you the 29
FELICES we have produced so far.
But do you know what your Union
Officers have been doing on your
behalf over the last ten months?
