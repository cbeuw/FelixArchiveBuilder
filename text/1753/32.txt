Kenny is the president of the Basket-
ball club this year alongside being in
his second year at university studying
Bio-Engineering.He’sdonealotofwork
this year to try and make basketball run
as smoothly as possible with the current
pandemic. He agreed to be interviewed
about his favourite basketball moments
in the basketball club. However, it is
very difficult to find just one favourite
moment, so instead, we’ve asked him to
talk about the three best moments he’s
had with the club. In
mostsports,yourfirst
and last game can be
the most memora-
ble, such as watching
Kobe Bryant in his
last game score 60
points (which also
happenstobeKenny’s
favourite moment in
sports history). It is
theonethatcanbring
a lot of emotion: anxiety, excitement,
happiness,pride,andacceptance.There’s
also the big games: finals in a champion-
ship, promotion games, or games where
your family or friends come and watch.
But sometimes, the most memorable
moments you have can come from ran-
dom games that you expected to maybe
blend into memory after a few years. At
the end of the day, sometimes you don’t
even remember how the game ended;
the important part of the game was how
you felt in a specific moment. Kenny’s
moments encompass all these. His best
memory was against Bucks university, in
High Wycombe. Bucks university may
have a small reputation of having refer-
ees that think there is no way Bucks has
done anything wrong and should never
get called on, and that the other team
is absolutely atrocious and is out to get
them. During the game, a lot of Impe-
rial’s players had a few fouls, including
Kenny, who had four (in basketball, if
you have five fouls, you get kicked out
of the game, sim-
ilar to a red card).
After a long game,
the last minute
comes along and
somehow Imperial
are only 4 points
down (“somehow”
being that the oth-
er team was given
enough free shots
for it to be embar-
rassing if they didn’t win). Imperial had
possession and was able to score, so we
were being down only 2 points. As the
ball is inbounded, Imperial foul so that
Bucks have to start from the half court
and the timer stops. BUCKS inbounds
the ball again from the half court to
their main player, “who I was in charge
of defending”. As their main player starts
to move, “I manage to steal the ball, run
down to the basket, and go up for a lay-
up. The buzzer sounds just
as I make [the basket]”. This
ties the game and puts it
into overtime, which sadly
Imperial lost. Even though
Imperial lost in overtime,
that steal and buzzer beat-
er made the game. Kenny’s
first game at Imperial ranks
second in his favourite mo-
ments. “In my first game, I
remember I was really nerv-
ous because I hadn’t played
in 6 months, and I had
made it into the Men’s Sec-
ond Team. I was also told
I would be in the starting
5. I was really excited and
I wanted to prove myself.”
The team had travelled to
Portsmouth for this game,
which was a 2.5 hour jour-
ney to play Portsmouth’s
first team. As the game
started, “I quickly realized
that this team was absolute-
ly incredible” and they had home court
advantage and had a lot of supporters on
their side. Imperial at this time had only
managed to have trials and one training
session together due to the late start of
the season, so they lacked team chem-
istry and hadn’t played together before.
Therefore “we got demolished! We lost
overall by 40 points… It was embarrass-
ing, they were insane!” Even with that
defeat, there can still be moments that
redeem you (in parts). “In the dire mo-
ments of the game, they had a fast break.
They had this guy that kind of looked
like Ben Simmons, quite tall, and mus-
cular… They passed it out to him and he
was by himself running down the court,
and I come running down behind him.
He goes up for a dunk and I block him!
Everyone on our team got so gassed!”
The player tries to have the referee call
a foul (which is what a lot of players do
when they get blocked and are a little
embarrassed, even though they know it
was fair play), but the referee said that
block was all ball so he didn’t get the
foul either! At the end, when we were
talking about the game, our captain said
“guys we may have lost by 40, but we
are gonna remember that block!”And
Kenny’s third ranked greatest memo-
ry comes from his last game in his first
year. His team had won the previous
game, “so we all started the game pretty
confident, the team had played together
more and we had team chemistry, and
I felt more comfortable”. As the game
goes on, Imperial realizes they are doing
great! Since we were doing well, “I pop
up for a three and it goes in. So I’m like,
okay, feeling good, I’m comfortable. So
I decide to go for a second three, which
was a bit further out, and it goes in. I’m
getting even more confident”. So then
the game goes into second half, where
the teams switch sides of the court. Ken-
ny is coming down the side of the court
with the ball where the Surrey bench is
and their players are saying “leave him,
he can’t shoot”. To this, Kenny “wanted
to show them up, so I pull up for a three
and it goes in. I turn around, look at
them, put my finger over my mouth, and
shush them as a joke. I was smiling and
laughing and they were laughing as well”.
Imperial won that game, but “that was a
good moment!”
