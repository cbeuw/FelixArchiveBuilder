XCLUSIVE: In an interview
with Felix, the most prominent
anti-lockdown scientist Professor
Sunetra Gupta denied being funded by
“libertarian think tanks” after accusations
from scientists opposed to her ‘herd im-
munity’ policy proposal, claiming that
they have “caused damage” to her and her
family.
Gupta, who co-authored the ‘Great
Barrington Declaration’ proposal that
was launched at the right-wing think
tank American Institute for Economic
Research, also denounced New Zealand’s
successful coronavirus response as “na-
tionalistic”, suggesting their border
restrictions were impractical.
She also stressed her use of
a private PR firm was due to
services being delivered “pro
bono” in conjunction with the
University of Oxford Press
Office, which seemingly con-
flicts with their comments
on this matter from March
where they claimed that the
University “cannot comment
on individual arrangements that
it is not party to.”
It is difficult to discuss the student cul-
ture at Imperial without mentioning
Imperial Secrets (IS). Anarchic, it is the
place where students can anonymously
spread their thoughts, musings and views
to the student body.
While always controversial, the page
has come under sustained criticism over
the last couple of months being accused
amongst other things of censorship, unac-
ceptable liberalism, racism and socialism.
With previous Imperial confessions
page Imperial College Exposed (ICE)
shutting down with the admin blaming
burnout from reading through the large
amount of distressing and abusive posts,
Felix spoke to the admin team of IS to
find out how they are coping with the
stress and what they thought the
page was for.
Confessions pages have al-
ways occupied a strange place in
a university ecosystem. Outside
of direct university control they
are yet still affiliated with the uni-
versity. As seen at ExHonestly the now
defunct Exeter confessions page this
can cause problems. The admins there
let through coded neo-nazi slogans lead-
ing to a backlash against the page and a
referral to the police by the university.
The Imperial Secrets admin team, made
up of Ethan, Seb, Olivia, Rayan, LH and
Admin H who would prefer not to be
named, are aware of the fine line that they
walk. Ethan explained how careful the
team have to be to avoid getting “zucced”.
