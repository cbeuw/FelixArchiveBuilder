COMMENT
On 24 September, the government
introduced the Covert Human
Intelligence Sources (Criminal Con-
duct) Bill to the House of Commons.
Simply put, this Bill will allow certain
authorities’ intelligence gatherers
(“covert human intelligence sources”, i.e.
undercover police and informants) to
conduct criminal activities.
Unsurprisingly this stirred up a huge
controversy, with the press dubbing it
“licence to kill”. MP Zarah Sultana op-
posed the Bill as it “doesn’t prohibit tor-
ture, murder or sexual violence”. These
claims are inaccurate. All public author-
ities are bound by Human Rights Act
1998 to act in under the European Con-
vention on Human Rights (“ECHR”).
Article 3 of ECHR
prohibits torture and
inhuman or degrad-
ingtreatment.Unlike
most other Rights
protected by ECHR
which are qualified,
prohibition of tor-
ture is absolute. There
is no circumstance
that could justify an
interference against
Article 3. As such,
this Bill can never be
used as a defence in
court against torture
or sexual violence. Regarding murder,
Article 2 allows deprivation of life only
under 3 circumstances. All of which are
powers authorities al-
ready have and this Bill
grants nothing addi-
tional.
But none of these
safeguards derives
from the merits of
the Bill itself; they
were enshrined into
human right leg-
islations and UK’s
international treaty
obligations. Instead,
this Bill opens up
the bucket of worms
that allows for rou-
tine transgressions of the law by the au-
thorities and frustrates options of reme-
diation against abuse of power, things
which will quickly erode people’s confi-
dence in the state.
The most significant issue of this Bill
is the grant of criminal immunity to an
exceptionally wide range of authorities.
The Bill applies not just to MI5, MI6
andGCHQ–onesweexpecttoconduct
crimes, but also any police force. The 45
territorial police forces are not centrally
managed and have a widely varying lev-
el of competence and professionalism.
The Bill allows all to independently issue
“criminal conduct authorisations” with-
out external oversights.
The government claims, in their Ex-
planatory Notes to the Bill, that author-
