COMMENT
Mark Twain once joked that “if we
would learn what the human race
is at the bottom, we need only observe
it in election time.” “If voting made any
difference,” he sullenly wrote elsewhere,
“they wouldn’t let us do it.” Putting such
scornful reflections aside, elections are,
and have always been, the lifeblood of
American democracy, embodying the
bedrock premise of American political
culture that legitimate rule derives from
the acquiescence of the governed. The
race for the White House has begun in
earnest, and while the world waits for
the results, it’s essential to understand
the mechanism behind the voting pro-
cess.
America at the ballot:
Americans don’t directly vote for the
Presidential candidates, instead, they
vote for people called “electors” in their
state who are supporting the candidate
they wish to become President - this ‘as-
semblage’ is known as the electoral col-
lege. The electoral college was created
by the Founding Fathers
in the year 1787; it was
a compromise between
electing the president
by a vote in Congress
or electing through a
popular vote by qual-
ified citizens. The col-
lege came into existence
because the delegates
wanted to balance the
interests of high-pop-
ulation & low-popu-
lation states, they also
believed that not all
voters would be educat-
ed enough to cast a vote
so the electoral college
would act as a buffer between the people
and electing the president.
The more people that live in a state,
the more electors there are. Presently,
there are 538 electors in total, made up
of 435 Representatives (Congressmen
& Congresswomen) and 100 Senators,
plus the three additional electors from
the District of Columbia. Each state is
allowed a minimum of three elector-
al votes, and Washington DC also gets
three-body votes, forming a total of 538
electors. The candidate with the most
number of electors wins all the state’s
body votes and also the first candidate to
win enough states and to get to 270 elec-
toral votes is elected into the office. Cali-
fornia, considered to be the most crucial
state, has 55 electoral votes, while Texas,
the next largest, gets 38 electoral votes.
New York and Florida get 29 votes each.
Allbuttwostates–MaineandNebraska
– use a winner-takes-all system (“Win-
ner takes all” means all Electoral College
votes will go to one candidate based on
the State’s popular vote), so if someone
wins the foremost votes during a state,
they take its entire haul of body votes.
To be elected President, either candi-
date must win a majority of the 538 elec-
tors - i.e. 270 electors. The body system
does usually reflect the popular vote (the
popular vote is simply which candidate
has received the
most total votes)
– Presidents have
won the electoral
vote while losing
the popular vote.
A recent instance
was in 2016 when
Donald Trump
won the body and
was elected Presi-
dent, even though
Hillary Clinton,
his Democratic
opponent, won
the popular vote.
The casting of a
vote for the Presi-
dential Election may be a simple choice
between candidates from the Demo-
cratic Party and the Republican Party,
although, occasionally a 3rd party can-
didate throws their name in the hat, like
Kanye West this year, it’s quite rare for
them to get any traction or make some
major impact.
So when Ameri-
cans will cast their
vote on November
3rd, they would
technically be vot-
ing for “electors”,
not directly for the
Presidential Can-
didates themselves.
Each elector then
casts one vote fol-
lowing the final
election for one of
the two candidates
(here, Trump and
Biden). The newly
elected president
and vice-president
are said to be inau-
gurated on January
20, 2021, although
the date isn’t set in
stone, given the fact
that a significant
number of people
have mailed-in their
votes, so counting
& results would be
done a little differ-
ently, owing to the
pandemic.
The key for either party to win the
Presidential Election is by focusing on
the specific swing states, also known as
the battleground or purple states. Swing
states can shift between each election
cycle, and they are often determined
by analysing past results, opinion polls,
political trends and any strengths or
weaknesses of the candidates involved,
and their policies. These states have un-
clear party loyalties and have historically
swung between voting for Republican
and Democrat candidates in past elec-
tions. This year North Carolina, Flori-
da, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona
could all be decisive within the election’s
outcome. They’re all states in which Mr
Trump narrowly won against Hillary
Clinton in 2016, helping him secure his
Presidency. Retaining them is crucial to
his re-election hopes. If the polls are to
betrusted,MrBidenholdsacompetitive
edgeoverMrTrumpaltogether.Pollsters
attributed Mr Biden’s result in support
amongwhiteuniversity-educatedvoters,
while Mr Trump’s support among white
working-class voters is waning. Current-
ly, the 10-poll average indicates that just
over 1/2 Americans will back Mr Biden
while Mr Trump’s support trails this by
around five or six points.
