her daughter’s school application form.
The second major issue was the creep-
ing scope of circumstances under which
criminal immunities are granted.
RIPA permits the most intrusive
forms of surveillance to be performed
when it is necessary to prevent and de-
tect serious crimes. The phrase “serious
crime” is not a vague catch-all but a
well-defined term: it means a crime for
which a 21-year-old with no previous
convictionscouldexpecttobesentenced
for at least 3 years, or violence that either
results in substantial financial gain or is
conducted by a large group of people.
In contrast, the Bill permits a criminal
conduct authorisation to be issued for
“preventing or detecting crime or of pre-
venting disorder”. This means any crime
whatsoever. One has to ask, is it ever
necessary or proportionate to commit
a (potentially serious) crime in order to
prevent or detect a non-serious crime?
Indeed, the Bill requires any authorised
criminal conduct to be proportionate
to its ends, but it stopped short of lim-
iting power to its original
scope.
The third issue
is the lack of judi-
cial oversight and
what I regard as a
gross interference
against the judici-
ary.
The Investiga-
tory Powers Act
2016 aka. “Snoop-
ers Charter” up-
dated the frame-
work under which
intelligence agen-
cies can intercept
communications.
Interception War-
rants need to be
approved in ad-
vance by both the Home Secretary and
a senior judge. There is no similar safe-
guard in the Bill for committing crimes.
All judicial scrutiny will have to be done
post-mortem, after the crime has been
committed.
In the Explanatory Note, the gov-
ernment claims that activities conduct-
ed outside an authorisation are not
immune from prosecutions. But what
about activities conducted under an un-
lawful authorisation? The government
dodged this question in Parliament, so
it’s likely that such activities carry impu-
nity. The authorisation itself can only be
challenged through the secretive Investi-
gatory Power’s Tribunal – a process nei-
ther short, nor easy, nor cheap.
The House of Commons Library
thinks “the Bill would limit redress for
victims by preventing civil claims for in-
jury or other harm”. If this is correct, it
means no one can bring a civil lawsuit
against an agent for committing crimes
under the authorisation, even when the
victim is an innocent “collateral dam-
age”. The ability to bring civil claim is
important because under criminal pro-
ceedings, the high standard of proof
(“beyond reasonable doubt”, i.e. “sure”)
means that a conviction could be diffi-
cult; whereas the victim is much more
likely to win in a civil court presenting
the same set of evidence, due to lower
standard of proof (“on the balance of
probabilities”, i.e. “likely”). For instance,
some victims of sexual assault in Scot-
land have been advised to bring a civil
lawsuit against the abuser when the ev-
idence is convincing but leaves room for
reasonable doubts.
As the Chair of the Parliamentary
Security and Intelligence Committee
Julian Lewis pointed out during the
debate, the intelligence agencies knew
that they possess no legal immunity and
are bound by all civil and criminal laws
equally; rather, they rely on convincing
the prosecutor that it is not in the public
interest to prosecute. This is, in my opin-
ion,therightapproach,asitappliespres-
sureandboundarytoallactionsmadeby
a covert agent to be within the public in-
terest, which would have to then be test-
ed by the prosecutors in the usual
manner as they conduct
the public inter-
est test to any
other charging
decisions. The

COMMENT
ising criminal activities “is not a new
activity” and the Bill “puts existing prac-
tice on a clear and consistent statutory
footing”. This is blatantly misleading.
Ordinary police forces have always oper-
atedundertheassumptionthattheycan-
not authorise anyone to break the law.
If there is a frequent need for ordinary
police forces’ undercover officers and in-
formants to commit certain crimes, then
the Parliament should grant them power
specific and limited to those particular
crimes they need to commit, rather than
a blank cheque on all crimes. One exam-
ple of this was the Sexual Offences Act
2003, which explicitly granted members
of MI5 and GCHQ immunity for mak-
ing indecent (pseudo-)photographs of
children – not all police forces, and not
even the MI6, as such immunity would
not be necessary or proportionate for
their functions. This implies the Parlia-
ment was operating under the under-
standing that it is not lawful for public
authorities to commit crimes as they saw
necessary, but only when so permitted
by legislation; otherwise the explicit ex-
emption would
not have been
necessary.
This type of
over-delega-
tion of power
has its prece-
dence and has
led to a pleth-
ora of abuse.
The Regula-
tion of Inves-
tigatory Pow-
ers Act 2000
( “ R I PA” ) ,
which this
Bill amends,
provides legal
grounds and
s a f e g u a r d s
on activities
such as wiretapping and intrusive sur-
veillance. Much of the power set out by
RIPA was granted to almost all public
authorities, including local councils.
Councils then happily made good use
of these surveillance powers to, among
other things, spy on council employees’
car parking, working hours and sick pay
claims;findoutthepigeonfeeder;andin
one case in Poole, the council followed a
mother’s movement, watched her in her
house and drew up a profile of her activi-
ria like those currently being used by
public prosecutors.
In summary, this is a Bill which grants
the power to authorise crimes to all sorts
of authorities, under vaguely defined cir-
cumstances with no judicial oversight
and little legal recourse to victims of
abuse of power.
But worry not, our beloved Home
Secretary Priti Patel has promised us at
the beginning of the bill:
“In my view the provisions of the Cov-
ertHumanIntelligenceSources(Criminal
Conduct) Bill are compatible with the Eu-
ropean Convention on Human Rights.”
