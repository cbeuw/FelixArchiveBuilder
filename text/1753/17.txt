The release of the newest addition to the
James Bond franchise, No Time to Die,
has been postponed until next year. Met-
ro-Goldwyn-Mayer claims that
the delay is due to the ongo-
ing coronavirus pandemic, but
some say that hasty reshoots
after poor test screenings are
to blame.
Hangman spoke to an in-
dustry insider who said that
the film currently suffered
from “confused themes”, spe-
cifically referring to the dedi-
cation of 80% of its runtime to
“nuanced discussions of yield
curve risk and hedging strategies”. A leaked
copy of the film’s first draft saw the iconic MI6
agent, played by Daniel Craig, spending most
of his scenes sat on the phone to Rami Mal-
ek’s maniacal auditor Safin, with less sex and
violence than any film in the franchise to date.
While some praised the “brave” new direc-
tiontakenbythefilmmakers,notingthe“raw”
and “boring; God, so, so boring” portray-
al of financial reality, dissent
from this opinion has been
near-universal.
One test screening viewer
was disappointed in what he
called the film’s “no-booby
philosophy”, adding that in
previous years “you could al-
ways rely on Bond girls to de-
liver a low yield to maturity”.
Our sources confirm that re-
shoots are wrapping up now,
withanewplotlinebasedpri-
marily on “the differences between electron
sharing and electrovalence”. It remains to be
seen whether the improvements land on wel-
coming eyes.
