The Social Dilemma shines a light on
a world which is addicted to dopa-
mine, one with its democracies under
threat, a mental health epidemic, and
where fake news travels six times faster
than real news. According to former Sili-
conValleyplayers,themaincauseofthese
problems are the very social platforms
they helped to create. They tell us that in
their pursuit of profit, online platforms
like Google and Facebook employed a
business model that neglected our need
for privacy, truth and care. This business
model, which Professor Shoshna Zuboff
named ‘surveillance capitalism’, works
through the mass surveillance of our on-
line personal experiences and the transla-
tion of these experiences into behaviour-
al data. These data are then used through
a process of machine intelligence to cre-
ate prediction products that anticipate
what you will do now, soon, and further
into the future.
We are told that
the buying and
selling of these
prediction prod-
ucts creates a mar-
ketplace of human
futures, where
according to the
creator of virtual
reality, Jaron Lani-
er, the product is
the gradual, im-
perceptible change
in our own behaviour and perception. It
was Google who created the first mar-
kets to trade in human futures, what we
now know as online targeted advertising.
However, as we saw with the Cambridge
Analytica scandal, our data isn’t just sold
and used in the name of consumerism,
but also for political ends which can
undermine our democracies. The main
problem with surveillance capitalism de-
rives from its imperative - a promise in
the certainty of influence. For this prom-
ise to hold true, platforms need to both
optimise the accuracy of their prediction
products and the engagement of users on
their platforms.
To demonstrate the ways the pursuit
of these aims is manifesting in societal
ills, the documentary presents a fictional
narrative of two siblings struggling with
the consequences of their use of social
networks. The main storyline follows a
teenage boy who is addicted to his de-
vice at the expense of his social life, and
then finds himself becoming increasing-
ly involved in a political group called the
‘extreme centre’ and ultimately arrested
at one of their volatile protests. In the
storyline, a metaphor of three men at a
control desk represent the way machine
intelligence algorithms work. Although
it’s a silly metaphor, it does a good job
of showing us how the algorithms struc-
tured into the design of these platforms
exploit our primordial psychology in or-
der to channel our attention and keep us
engaged.
Notifications, news feeds, and recom-
mendations are all tailored to our indi-
vidual personalities and are designed to
keep us online.
In fact, we are
told about a team at
Facebook who were
working to maxim-
ise our dopamine
release. Although,
Facebook claims
that the aim of such
research is to create
a better user experi-
ence, we should be
sceptical of the fact
this aim coincides
with its goals to collect as much of our
data as possible. The longer we stay on
their platform, the more data they can
collect, not to mention the additional
money our time on their platform gets
them from the advertisements we might
click. Regardless of what companies like
Facebook claim, The Social Dilemma
makes it clear that the reality is not a bet-
ter user experience. The dopamine-ori-
ented design preys on our basic social de-
sires and leads many of us to conflate our
self-worth with our online identities; the
result being a generation of youth with a
warped sense of identity and poor men-
tal health.
Perhaps even more frightening is the
way these algorithms can guide people
towards extreme ideologies like the ‘ex-
tremecentre’presentedinthefilm.News
feeds tailored to our own interests serve
only to reinforce our own beliefs. With
this, it’s not surprising that when an al-
gorithm comes across someone suscep-
tible to the odd conspiracy theory and
feeds them more conspiracies on
their news feed, they’re
led towards an extreme
view that everything
being presented in the
mainstream is a lie. Un-
fortunately, conspiracy
theories tend to have
quite a lot of news value;
according to research from
MIT, fake news travels six times
faster than real news on social networks.
This same logic works for any political
ideology. The separate realities our indi-
vidually tailored news feeds create mean
people are entrenched in their own be-
liefs, unable to understand how anyone
could possibly think differently from
them. The result is an increasingly po-
larised world where truth has become an
ethereal notion. A world where each side
is shouting only to themselves and where
many of the cries have little factual sub-
stance.
Despite what The Social Dilemma
claims, the solution to these problems
does not lie in big tech. The narrative
that big tech can save us is as concern-
ing as the problem that needs solving.
The Social Dilemma is trying to set the
boundaries of who gets to be a critic and
what criticism looks like; we should not
expect tech companies to rehabilitate
themselves.
According to Zuboff, demanding pri-
vacy from surveillance capitalists is “like
a s k i n g
a giraffe
to have a
shorter neck or a cow to give up chew-
ing.Thesedemandsareexistentialthreats
that violate the basic mechanisms of the
entity’s survival.”
Many thinkers, a lot of whom are
women and people of colour, and who
are recognised as leaders when it comes
to the insights on these problems were
omitted from the documentary- Safiya
Noble, Cathy O’Neil and Ruha Ben-
jamin to name a few. Their work is tes-
tament to an existing body of literature
that combines tech, social and ethical
considerations and questions tradition-
al tech wisdom surrounding algorithms,
problem-solving and money-making.
They highlight the implicit assumptions
embedded in algorithms and challenge
the notion that market pressures lock
us into surveillance capitalism. They
also raise the importance of timely gov-
ernment regulation, and the benefits of
counter innovation. The development of
tools like adblocker, one of the biggest
user revolts ever seen, can give individu-
als more meaningful control in navigat-
ing online platforms. This is important
becauseempoweringourpersonalauton-
omy takes the power out of big tech, and
permits the population power in steering
social networks towards the vision of so-
ciety we want to live in.
