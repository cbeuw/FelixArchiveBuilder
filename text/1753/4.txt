The impact of the coronavirus pan-
demic will be felt for generations to
come. From the numerous lives lost to
the worst economic crisis since the Great
Depression of the 1930s, our society is
being shaped on a level unseen in recent
history. Yet policymakers remain divided
onhowtodealwiththiscrisis,withsome
epidemiologists voicing opposition to
the scientific consensus in an open letter
policy proposal titled the ‘Great Barring-
ton Declaration’.
ByApril,3.9billionpeoplewereunder
stay-at-home orders, alternatively known
as a lockdown. These restrictions were
enacted by govern-
ments based on ad-
vice from their own
scientists, represent-
ing the consensus
view on how to deal
with the pandem-
ic. This strategy re-
quires locking down
until a functional
test and trace system
can be implemented
to identify and iso-
late new infections.
After this period,
lockdown lifts, while
public health measures such as mandato-
ry masks and restrictions on large gather-
ingsarekeptinplace.Unlikeincountries
such as New Zealand, the test and trace
system in the UK has not been effective
enough to avoid a second lockdown, and
thus the system was identified by the
Government’sScientificAdvisoryGroup
for Emergencies (SAGE) as unable to
curb the uncontrolled growth in cases in
the last two months. The test-and-trace
system is hoped to be temporary, as gov-
ernments are relying on the approval of a
safe and effective COVID vaccine in the
next few months, allowing normal life to
resume once it is distributed.
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
RESTRICTIONS
Ontheothersideofthescientificcom-
munity, researchers have been calling for
a completely different approach to con-
trolling - or even putting an end to - the
pandemic: naturally acquired herd im-
munity. To find out more about this pro-
posal, Felix interviewed Sunetra Gupta,
Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology
at the University of Oxford, who has
beenthemostprominentacademiccritic
of the policy consensus and who co-au-
thored the
G r e a t
Barring-
ton Dec-
laration.
T h e
Declara-
tion rests
on the
concept
of herd
i m m u -
nity. In
this ap-
proach,
all vul-
nerable individuals would be shielded,
while the rest of the population resumes
normal life with no restrictions, allowing
them to become infected, recover, and
thereby acquire immunity to COVID.
A threshold of 60-70% of the popula-
tion who have recovered from COVID
would need to be surpassed to achieve a
reliable level of herd immunity. The term
‘herd immunity’, as noted by Fine et al in
the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal,
“is widely used but carries a variety of
meanings”. To Gupta, “it does not refer
to, in this case, a level of exposure or im-
munity that causes the virus to disappear.
It refers to a level of immunity which is
an equilibrium. These are dynamic sys-
tems which settle and hover around an
endemic equilibrium, and the popula-
tion level at that endemic equilibrium is
what we call the herd immunity thresh-
old”, suggesting that her view of herd
immunity is one where the infected pro-
portion of the population remains con-
stant, rather than exponentially decaying
as other definitions of herd immunity
would require.
The Declaration was also co-authored
by Gupta’s colleagues: Jay Bhattachar-
ya and Martin Kulldorff, professors of
medicine at Stanford and Harvard re-
spectively. In it, the professors lay out
their proposal, called “Focused Protec-
tion” and call on governments all over
the world to lift lockdown, as “keeping
these measures in place until a vaccine is
available will cause irreparable damage,
with the underprivileged disproportion-
ately harmed”.
This emphasis on the harmful effects
of lockdown is seen throughout the Dec-
laration, and throughout the interview
with Felix, Gupta emphasised those ef-
fects as the primary motivation behind
their proposal. “It seems to me that these
other strategies are just not addressing
thecostsoflockdown.”shesaid,referring
tothepoliciesenactedbymostcountries.
It is right that these concerns are
brought up and discussed; it is evident
that lockdowns contribute to a decline
in mental health,
particularly for
young people. A
survey by men-
tal health chari-
ty Young Minds
revealed that 80% of young people in
the UK felt the pandemic made their
mental health worse, with 87% report-
ing increased loneliness and isolation in
lockdown. Meanwhile, a BBC Panora-
ma investigation found domestic abuse
reports soared during lockdown with 3
in 4 victims identifying the restrictions
as a barrier to escaping their abusers.
Further, police data showed that BAME
people were being disproportionately
fined under coronavirus restriction laws,
exacerbating the systemic biases in law
enforcement. This is not to mention the
effect lockdowns can have on economies
particularly reliant on the service sector,
leading to job losses if adequate govern-
ment support is not provided alongside
the restrictions.
However, scientists representing the
consensus view have been keen to agree
with these critiques and have stressed
that a cycle of lockdowns is not the an-
swer – rather, a lockdown is a tool to buy
time to invest in healthcare services and
in test-and-trace systems.
ARGUMENTS FOR
RESTRICTIONS
Scientists promoting the so-called
‘herdimmunity’strategy,particularlythe
authorsoftheGreatBarringtonDeclara-
tion, have come under scathing criticism.
From the problem of our lack of knowl-
edge around COVID immunity, to dis-
putes about how vulnerable individuals
can be identified and fully isolated from
the rest of the population, the scientific
community has not eased off its criticism
since the Declaration was published on
October 4th.
The main concern
that many scientists
have raised is the du-
ration of immunity.
Rupert Beale, Head of
the Cell Biology of In-
fection Laboratory at the Francis Crick
institute, claimed that the Declaration
was not a helpful contribution to the de-
bate on COVID policy, explaining that
“we know that immunity to coronavi-
ruses wanes over time, and re-infection
is possible – so lasting protection of vul-
nerable individuals by establishing ‘herd

herd immunity, lockdowns, and the various concerns about her work voiced by mainstream scientists.
