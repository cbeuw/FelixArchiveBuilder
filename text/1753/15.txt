The interview I had with
members of the Imperial
Secrets team filled me
with a strange happi-
ness. Though they are
potentially not the
best adverts for the
student experience at
Imperial, joking about
disuading relatives from
applying to Imperial and the
atrotious state of mental health pro-
vision, what they have achieved leaves
me in awe of them.
As a biochemistry student I am
always impressed by those that seem
to have built or made somethings by
applying what they have learnt as part
of their degrees. Making something
using the knowledge we gain at Im-
perial is a very clear case of “applying
your degree”, something that not all
of us will ever get to do. I certainly
feel saddened about my percieved
lack of opportunities to apply what I
have learnt. That is, I feel, one of the
major reasons that I enjoy writing
and working at Felix. The opportu-
nity to learn skills in various Adobe
softwares, writing and design are
matched by opportunities to apply
those skills in the weekly production
of a newspaper.
I am hugely saddened by the lack of
a print newspaper this week
and the forseeable future.
When I was elected
to this role, a major
source of excitement
for me was the phys-
ical end-product.
Printed word holds an
incredible allure and
power that I have not seen
matched by technological
competitors. For that reason I will
fight tooth and nail to keep Felix as a
print paper. Facing another national
lockdown, we will endeavour to keep
the newspaper running, providing
you with more College and Union
news as well as the rest of our usual
fantastic content.
Everything that we usually put out
should be available on our website
felixonline.co.uk which has all of our
latest news as well as digital only con-
tent. Look at our social media feeds
on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram
for even more Felix content.
Finally, in the next coming weeks I
will be trying to fill the news section
with more pieces written by influ-
ential figures in the College and the
Union to provide you with an up to
date understanding of the decisions
relevant to your student experience
that are being made. Watch this space.

Half way through term,
things are looking up
The Felix Editor on
No printed paper this week
This week we are unable to bring you a
printedpaper.Weareyettorecieveap-
proval from the College to distribute
the newspaper and so have been asked
bytheUniontonotprint.Relunctant-
ly we have agreed. This is frustrating
for all students working at Felix and
can be easily remidied by the College
giving us approval to distribute again.
The World Health Organisation has
stated that printed paper is highly
sterile due to the nature of the print-
ing process and all of our newspapers
have Covid-19 warnings clearly print-
ed on them, encouraging people who
touch any of the newspapers to take
them away with them to avoid causing
cross contamination and infection of
any sort.
In addition, all distribution is done by
masked and gloved Felix volunteers,
further eliminating contamination
risk. We call on the College to allow
Felix to return to its rightful place
on campus by granting permission
for distribution of physical copies on
campus.

Statement
of Intent
We here at Felix believe that it is al-
ways in the interests of the students to
know. That cover-up and paternalistic
obfuscation is never right and that
as intelligent people students should
be treated with respect and given the
ability to make up their own minds.
Therefore, I, the Felix Editor, on be-
half of the team promise that:
We will to the best of our abil-
ity tell you the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
We will keep your confidence
and will only publish something
you say to us if you have explicitly
said that we can.
We will work to expose unfair-
ness and discrimination in all
forms that it takes both at the
College and elsewhere.
We will treat fairly any article
sent to us, regardless of point
of view and do our best to work
with you to prepare it for publi-
cation it in our pages.
