Why is waste normal?
If you didn’t know already, on the 1st
October 2020, a ban on throwaway
plastics came into place in England, in-
cluding plastic straws, plastic cotton
buds and plastic stirrers. However, es-
tablishments can still provide straws to
people with specific medical needs or a
disability (for whom straws were created
for in the first place).
This ban will remove billions of dis-
posable plastic items from circulation
every year and reduce the amount the
UK contributes to the 150 million
tonnes of plastic waste in the ocean. I
feel like the general public will see this as
an environmental ‘win’, considering the
rise in popularity of sea turtles in recent
years. However, I do beg to question
whether this is showing commitment
to the protection of the environment
for the planet and people, or is this just
another greenwashing ploy? It is posi-
tive to see that the government have not
brought in a blanket ban and have con-
sidered the importance of straws in the
daily lives of people with disabilities or
for their use in hospitals and clinics.
Nevertheless, this ban does seem like
the picking of low-hanging fruit. What
I mean is that this is just one small ele-
ment of the significant plastic pollution
problem and disposability culture we
currently live in. If the government truly
cared about the plastic pollution prob-
lem, they would have already banned
all single-use plastics and invested in re-
ducing plastic packaging production. A
spokesperson for DEFRA (Department
for Food, Environment and Ru-
ral Affairs) said the government
are ‘absolutely committed to
turning the tide on the wide-
spread use of single-use plastics’,
butweareyettoseethisareality.
Furthermore, the UK’s 25 Year
Environment Plan is not am-
bitious enough as the target to
eliminate avoidable plastic waste
is 2042! This current lack-lustre
approach is worrying for future
generations and shows how lit-
tle the government care for cli-
mate and environmental justice.
When I worked in a not-to-be-
named supermarket a few years
ago, I was exposed to the role of institu-
tions in the production of waste. At the
end of the day when the doors closed to
customers, we moved in for the night
shift to stock shelves and unsold fresh
bakery goods were all thrown away every
single night. The normalisation of this
act was startling. Even more shocking to
me was the fact that we meant to report
any sightings of people trying to ‘steal’
the thrown-away goods from the rub-
bish bins overnight. It is scary to think
that we live in a world in which using
‘unsellable’ food (potentially unsafe), is
stealing. Furthermore, not only do we
produce a lot of waste, but so often this
waste cannot be used. In the UK this
doesn’t just happen with food, but every
single good, from dishwashers to cuf-
flinks to potatoes.
Waste, as we know it, is a human con-
cept. Humans
are not inher-
ently waste-
ful beings, yet
our behaviour
shift started to
happen after
World War 2,
as the industry
saw an oppor-
tunity to make
profit gains
quickly. How
we saw our day
to day items
transformed by
strong market-
ing initiatives
of plastic and
packaging industry. With the design
of disposable plastics, the potential of
high economic gain was too good for
the production companies to resist, and
so they began the trend that still perme-
ates today. These companies contributed
to designing the world today and the
multitude of environmental and social
problems within it. Supposed dispos-
able plastic and other disposable objects,
such as clothing, people began to buy
more than they needed in what we now
call overconsumption. The design of dis-
posability for profit has shaped how we
live and contributes to the crises we find
ourselves in today.
We don’t think twice about buying
a plastic bag. We use it for as long as it
takes to get home, and then we throw it
away, so often that this act is engrained
in our muscle memory. We don’t consid-
er how long it took to produce the bag,
who made it or what pollution it may
have caused in the process. Neither do
we think about what happens to the bag
once it is collected by our local council,
for landfill or recycling.
How long will the bag
be around? Does it
decompose, and what
contamination might
it cause in the process?
As recycling is such
an institutionalised
process, it takes the
responsibility away
from the producer.
The normalcy of the
act of recycling, as a
natural occurrence to
our modern existence,
makes it seem simply
part of our routine to
buy disposable plastic
because we can recy-
cle it. Recycling also takes the guilt away
from the supposed eco-conscious con-
sumer.
However, putting the focus on the
consumer and municipal recycling in-
frastructures is precisely what the plas-
tic-producing industry want us to do.
The mega-producers of disposables de-
sign for mass-over-consumption, and
we are now wired to buy into this, or we
often have no other choice of product.
Companies can make a higher profit
if they offload their waste externalities
onto the recycling system, which is an
energy-using and
pollution pro-
ducing process
and often leads
to down-cycling,
where materials
are transformed
into a product
of lesser value
than before. Fur-
thermore, not
everything that
we put into recy-
cling bins is recycled. A lot of what we
separate into different bins at home and
work, ends up in the landfill, often due
to the complexity of the plastic prod-
uct or the lack of infrastructure. Even
more concerning is that many coun-
tries in the Global North, i.e. the USA
and the UK, have been known to send
their waste abroad to South East Asia,
and to be building waste incinerators
in the Global South too. The legacy of
colonialism and imperialism has led to
those who produce and profit from plas-
tic pollution, not to bear the brunt of its
after-life.
It is useful to frame the process of re-
cyclingasanotherwayofdisposal,which
Dr Max Liboiron discusses at depth in
her work on Discard Studies. A com-
plete re-thinking of the way we design
products and packaging is needed, high-
lighted by the work of The Slow Factory
on ‘Waste Led Design Systems’ in which
the end life of a product is considered
fromthebeginningofthedesignprocess.
