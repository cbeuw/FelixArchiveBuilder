WHAT SUCKS
IS SEEING HOW
THERE ARE
GENUINELY
SEXIST/RACIST
PEOPLE AMONG
STUDENTS

more features.
When I asked why they run the page,
they struggled to answer. Seb explained
that as a group the admins are “mostly
for freedom of speech about any topic
on the page, with the obvious and well
established caveats of inciting violence
and slander.” But the main motivation
seems to be the thrill of doing something
better than it has been done before. He
went on to say that this problem of
what a confessions page is for, whether
it should “be purely entertaining, and a
liberal safe space, or whether it should
allow people to voice unpopular opin-
ions and have them refuted via the page”
was one that the admins struggled to an-
swer on a daily basis.
Yet despite this members are committed
and dedicated. In 2020 the page has av-
eraged 19 submissions a day, hitting 148
on 6th June and the admins have the
air of journalists or dissidents, imbuing
their role with sacred purpose behind a
veil of inside jokes.
The admins are clearly proud of what
theyhavebuilt.“Havingsuchahighlevel
ofautomationhasallowedustohaveway
more features than (as far as I know) any
other uni confessions page that currently
exists. From adding moods, to uploading
images and video, to automatic poll crea-
tion, to emailing you when the secret has
been posted. Most other uni confessions
pages use crush ninja to manage submis-
sions, so because they don’t have an in
house solution like us, they don’t get all
these cool features. And on top of that,
if we think of something cool to add, we
can add it in a few hours”
However, spotting the bad posts is not
always easy. Admin H explained that
“there are sometimes disagreement on
what posts count as political, and a lot
of the time chains evolve from a non-po-
litical post into a political one, for ex-
ample the time when a bunch of sexist
secrets were submitted after one women
complained about being catcalled. So
it is sometime hard to judge when that
starts.”
Having a group of admins means that no
one person takes the brunt of complaints
and reading depressing posts. As a group
they can “laugh off the posts attacking us
and threatening to go to another page…
“But what sucks is seeing how there are
genuinely sexist/racist people among
the students.”
Having a group also helps relieve the
stress of the role. When asked about the
effect of the role on their mental health
the group did not re-
port any trouble,
though many men-
tioned how much
they sympathised
with the ICE admin
who had to moder-
ate all the submis-
sions themself. Hav-
ingagroupofpeople
means that “when
we get attacked for
being a shit page for
letting x through
and not y, we just
allow those submissions to be posted -
it doesn’t faze us in the slightest. These
idiots have no idea how the page is run,
they just sit there
submitting secrets
and complaining.
But at the end of
the day, if i were
forced to feel an
emotion towards
them, it’d probably
just be sympathy”
Accusations of
censorship also got
a short shrift. “We
actually chose to
not post anything
more about BLM
because we felt we couldn’t make the call
between racist incited violence and rac-
ist flawed logic that should be refuted by
public discourse.”
When asked why they had chosen to
reveal their identities now the team was
split. Some of them made no effort to
hide what they did, saying that the clout
was the major reason that they did what
they did. Others such as Admin H de-
cided to remain anonymous and admit-
ted that given the nature of some of the
submissions they would “not like them
associated with me”.
As of yet the group has not had any con-
tact with College, and hopes to keep
that up.
