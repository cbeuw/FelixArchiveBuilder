With the U.S. presidential elec-
tion just weeks away, the focus is
broadening from the singular emphasis
on the politics of the election to the po-
tential policy implications.
We here in the Felix investment sec-
tion think the the most likely election
scenario is worth exploring
• A Democratic sweep, with for-
mer Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
winning the White House, and Demo-
cratskeepingtheirmajorityintheHouse
of Representatives and taking back the
Senate (albeit by a very narrow margin).
We address this scenario in detail below,
since it would likely lead to substantial
policy shifts.
How would risk markets respond
under each scenario?
It is hard to definitively predict
what the market response would
be. The conventional wisdom in
2016 predicted a Trump victory
would trigger a market sell-off,
yet it outperformed for years.
Indeed, if history is any guide,
risk markets are somewhat im-
pervious to the outcome of the
election, having done well under
both Democratic- and Repub-
lican-led White Houses since
1932. As measured by the S&P
500 Index, the market has his-
torically performed marginally
better under Democratic than
under Republican administra-
tions, but best under divided
government.
While the direction of the overall
stock market may be hard to predict, it is
easier to forecast which sectors are likely
to be winners and losers under the two
election scenarios.
What policy changes should we expect
from a Democratic sweep?
Felix investment expects a Biden
White House and a Democrat-con-
trolled Congress to prioritize legislation
that would:
1. Modernise
infrastructure, going
beyond bridges and
roads to a national
broadband build-out
and climate-friend-
ly buildings and
schools.
2. S t r e n g t h -
en the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) by
putting it on firmer
legal standing and
ensuring it is actually
more affordable for
middle-income earn-
ers. We could also see
Democrats pass pre-
scriptiondrugpricingreformthatwould
lower drug costs by allowing Medicare
to negotiate prices, similar to current
programs in other government agencies,
including the Veterans Administration.
3. Raise taxes modestly to pay for
some of these changes. We believe only
more evolutionary, rather than revolu-
tionary, tax changes could pass a nar-
rowly Democratic Senate (such as a 25%
corporate tax rate versus the 28% rate
proposed).
4. Focus on climate-friendly regu-
latorychanges,suchascurbingemissions
from fossil fuels and limiting fracking on
public lands.
5. Provide significant COV-
ID-19-related funding for states and cit-
ies, in addition
to businesses,
if Congress still
has not passed
any addition-
al stimulus by
January 2021.
Outlook for
credit sectors
underaDemo-
cratic sweep
The winners
• Renew-
able energy
• Hospi-
tals
• Construction, particularly
homebuilding and infrastructure-relat-
ed
The losers
• Oil and gas exploration and pro-
duction, particularly firms exposed to
drilling on U.S. federal lands, both on-
shore and offshore
• Chemicals
• Healthcare, pharmaceuticals
Mixed
• Financials
• Technology
A few more takeaways:
• Financial sector faces challeng-
es: Despite what we think would be a
broader economic recovery and a re-
prieve from large-scale financial regula-
tion under a Trump win, the persistently
low interest rates that banks have faced
overthepastfouryearswilllikelyremain
a negative overhang to underlying equity
performance. Select credits will likely
fare much better.
• Energy suffers from secu-
lar changes: President Trump’s ener-
gy-friendly policies have done little to
aid oil and gas companies, which have
been hampered by heightened environ-
mental, social, and governance (ESG)
concerns, limited availability of incre-
mental investor capital given poor re-
turns, and secular headwinds, (i.e., elec-
tric vehicles and renewable energy).
• Technology is caught in polit-
ical fallout: Finally, we would expect
U.S-China trade tensions to continue
simmering with spillover effects primar-
ily hitting the technology sector equities
and high-yield credits, as witnessed with
the ongoing Huawei and TikTok issues.
US election and the bond market
A bond is a fixed income instrument
that represents a loan made by an inves-
tor to a borrower.
A type of fixed-income security, a bond
is an investment that provides a return
in the form of fixed periodic interest
payments and the eventual return of all
money that was originally lent at the ex-
pirey of the loan.
Bonds are used by companies, munic-
ipalities, states, and sovereign govern-
ments to raise money from the lenders
and investor around the world (the mar-
ket) to finance projects and operations.
A company might decide that, rather
than selling shares (equity) which re-
spresent part owenership of the compa-
ny they would prefer to borrow money
by issuing bonds.
Owners of bonds are debtholders, or
creditors, of the issuer.
Bonds can be bought and sold and their
price depends on the level of interest
paid on them and the amount of time
left until the bond must be paid back or
‘matures’. This is because when the price
of a bond falls by 50% the 1% annual re-
turn has in effect been doubled to 2%.
Bonds can be both long and short term
loans.
I am too embarassed to
ask... What is a bond?
