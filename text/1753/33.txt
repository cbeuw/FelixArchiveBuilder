ICBC win first ever Embankment Challenge
The Imperial College Boat Club 1st
VIII won the first installment of the
brand new “Embankment Challenge”,
an invitational time trial set up by
Thames Rowing Club. The new race was
set up because certain London Tideway
rowing clubs missing out on racing due
to the prohibition of river traffic under
Hammersmith Bridge. This, combined
with fears of overcrowding at hosts clubs
upstream and thus not being COV-
ID friendly, have caused rowing clubs
downstream of Hammersmith bridge
(most of which are based at Putney Em-
bankment, hence the name) locked out
of the recent Pairs Head, which they
would have normally taken part in and
competed for the top spots. The time
trial, starting just below Hammersmith
bridge and finishing near Wandsworth
Bridge, was approximately 4km long and
took eleven to twelve painful minutes
to complete. The weather was not ideal
with strong winds making conditions
on the stretch from Harrod’s to Craven
Cottage difficult, however there was no
heavy rain to dampen the mood. Due to
COVID, spectators were told to stay at
home, wrap up, and watch the progress
online as times were live-streamed for
the race. The Men’s 1st VIII, coxed by
Annelise Perkins and stroked by Max
Ridgwell, set the fastest time to the first
checkpoint and to the finish line with a
final time of eleven minutes and seven
seconds, beating a very fast Thames 1st
and 2nd VIII by seven seconds and nine
seconds respectively. The Men’s 2nd
VIII came in 7th place in a very tight
field, beating both of their compatriot
2nd VIIIs at London Rowing Club and
Vesta Rowing Club. In total, Imperial
fielded four VIIIs that took part in what
was a thrilling restart to racing; the first
in over half a year, as all major compe-
titions were cancelled last summer. This
was a promising first performance for all
crews, especially the 1st VIII, hungry for
redemption after missing out on what
was shaping up to be a highly successful
end to the 2019/20 season. All crews are
moving into a tough four weeks of hard
full-time preparation for the upcoming
Fours Head on the 22nd of November.
