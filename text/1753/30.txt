SUSTAINABILITY
Reducing Plastic as a Student in London
Everyone has the best intentions
when it comes to reducing sin-
gle-use plastic waste. But sometimes the
best intentions just aren’t enough. That’s
whythisarticlehascompiledsomeofthe
best shops and online delivery services
that’ll make sustainable choices easy for
you. From weekly groceries to personal
care products, these companies have got
you covered.
BULK MARKET
(in-store & online)
Bulk market is a
plastic-free shop in
Hackney, selling everything: organic
fruit and veg, staple foods, personal hy-
giene products, DIY cosmetics, snacks,
zero-waste kits, and most importantly,
freshly ground peanut butter! (who
wouldn’t want that?). Sold at affordable
prices, the Bulk Market is your one-
stop-shop for zero-waste products.
The best part is, they also offer online
delivery. You can simply go to the shop’s
website, select what you want, and
they’ll deliver to most areas in central
London. Grocery shopping plastic-free
has never been easier.
THE SOURCE BULK FOODS
(in-store and online)
The
Source
has its
roots in Australia when it was opened in
2012 with the aim of reducing pack-
aging and carbon footprint of grocery
shopping. The concept arrived in the
UK in 2018 and is now one of the lead-
ers in London Zero-waste shopping;
they have stores in Chiswick and Batter-
sea, but like the Bulk Market, also have
online delivery systems. Their product
range is similar to that of The Bulk
Market but tends to be slightly cheaper.
The zero-waste blog on their website
is also a great place to get tips and tricks
on how you can live a more environ-
mentally friendly lifestyle!
WEARTH LONDON (online)
Although
WEARTH
isn’t entirely
packag-
ing-free, we’ve decided to include them
in this list because their focus is still
on ethical, environmentally friendly
products, and they’ve also got a dedicat-
ed ‘zero waste’ section on their website.
Slightly different to other bulk stores,
WEARTH doesn’t sell food products,
but offers pretty much everything else
you might need: they have an extensive
range of ethically produced products
from furniture, jewellery, zero-waste
starter kits and more.
If you’re interested in making pur-
chases that are not just good for you but
for the environment and our society, be
sure to check out WEARTH.
ABEL & COLE (online)
Abel & Cole offers one of the most
wholesome online shopping experiences
you could have. They provide delicious,
ethical sustainably sourced fresh pro-
duce, as well as pantry staples, weekly
essentials, fresh bakery and household
products all in sustainable returnable,
reusable, recyclable packaging.
FARM DROP (online)
Farm drop is an online market for
purchasing fresh produce as well as oth-
er foodstuffs, all of which you can filter
using the
‘plastic-free’
option on
their website.
They also wrap whatever produce re-
quires bagging with compostable bags,
making it a much better alternative
than going to supermarkets. You won’t
be missing out on convenience either,
because their fast delivery allows you to
order by midday for a next day delivery!
Oh, and they also have a recipe sec-
tion on their website with ideas on how
you can produce seasonal recipes using
their high-quality ingredients.
Making sustainable choices doesn’t
have to be difficult. It’s all about know-
ing where to source your products and
produce. Hopefully this guide offers
you a glimpse into all the creative ways
you can make a positive impact. Finally,
it’s also important to remember that
when it comes to sustainability, the best
thing to do is to reduce consumption in
general - purchasing sustainably is the
next best option.
This week’s inspiration: A Plastic Ocean
APlastic Ocean is a documentary
that captures the tragic realities of
our love-hate relationship with plastic. I
still vividly remember watching this two
summers ago during a family holiday
in Japan. Coincidentally, Japan ranks
number 2 in global per-capita plastic us-
age. I wasn’t surprised to see why, given
that every single cookie is individually
wrapped in plastic inside a larger plastic
package.
A Plastic Ocean opened my eyes to
the reality of our love-hate relationship
with plastic. Lightweight, cheap and
sturdy, the very reasons we began using
plastic for, has now become the reasons
why they’re so destructive for our plan-
et. The producer, Producer Jo Ruxton
felt a deep sense of urgency to alert so-
cieties about this issue, upon witnessing
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
The Great Pacific Garbage patch is
a region of ocean between Hawaii and
California and happens to be one of the
largest offshore marine debris and plas-
tic accumulation hotspots in the world
spanning across 1.6 million square kilo-
metres. To put it into perspective, that’s
two times the size of Texas or three
times the size of France.
What’s worse is that once plastic
waste accumulates in these regions,
they don’t go away – they break down
mechanically or by solar energy, into
microplastics. Microplastics are so small
we can hardly see them, but that’s what
makes them lethal. They not only harm
marine wildlife but accumulate in food
chains and eventually end up in our
bodies every time we eat seafood.
Although plastic production began
in the 1950s, nearly half of the current
plastic waste that exists come from just
the last 14 years. Much of it boils down
to the fact that we’re
oblivious to just how
much single-use plas-
tic waste we produce
and how damaging
it is. A Plastic Ocean
offers a detailed un-
derstanding of both
topics, including cut-
ting-edge research
and scientists who
attests to the dangers
that await our future
if we don’t act.
It’s a 1.5-hour watch and is bound to
change the way you think about plastic
waste. Alternatively, if you’re keen on
learning more about it, some other great
resources are: Turning the Tide on Plas-
tic by Lucy Siegle and the 3-part BBC
Radio series, Fantastic Plastic by Mark
Miodownik.
