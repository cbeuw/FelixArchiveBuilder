Following days of mysterious whis-
pers of an “exciting new discovery
about the Moon”, NASA finally let us in
on their secret on Thursday. It was an-
nounced via the NASA TV live stream
that two separate studies, both pub-
lished by Nature Astronomy, had dis-
covered water on the moon, including
on the sunlit lunar surface.
The two studies were conducted using
data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnais-
sance Orbiter, which has been in orbit
around the moon since 2009, and the
Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA), a converted Boe-
ing-747 which carries a 2.7 metre tele-
scope and is able to fly above 99% of
the water vapour in the Earth’s at-
mosphere.
The Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter took photos and
temperature measure-
ments of the dark, cold
side of the moon. Pre-
vious studies have
found evidence for
“cold traps” of ice on this part of the
moon, but these were thought to be re-
stricted to deep, wide craters. The new
research suggests that there are also “mi-
cro-cold traps”, which are smaller are-
as that are permanently shadowed and
could therefore contain more easily ac-
cessible ice.
Using infrared astronomy, SOFIA
detected water molecules in the Clavius
Crater, one of the moon’s largest craters
which is visible from Earth. Previous
research had shown that hydrogen was
present in these craters, but
scientists had
not been
able to rule out the possibility that this
was due to the presence of hydroxyl
(-OH) rather than water (H20). The
infrared spectra produced by SOFIA
now give definitive evidence that water
is present - but it is unclear how exact-
ly this water is protected from the harsh
lunar environment. The researchers have
suggested that it could be stored be-
tween grains on the surface, or in bub-
bles of “lunar glass” to protect it.
The discovery of water on the sunlit
surface is significant for several reasons.
While scientists were previously
aware of the presence of
some water on
the moon,
these
new studies suggest that it is much more
abundant than previously thought. They
also show that the distribution of water
across the lunar surface is not limited to
cold, shadowy places, which may make
it more accessible for extraction. This
could make it possible to establish a sus-
tainable human presence on the moon,
with water available both for sustaining
life and for refuelling aircraft. It would
be far cheaper to make rocket fuel on the
Moon than to transport it from Earth,
so the Moon could potentially become a
gas station for travellers to deeper outer
space.
This week’s announcement could
therefore be very significant for NASA’s
Artemis Programme, which aims to send
the first woman and next man to the
moon by 2024, and to create a “gateway”
in orbit on the moon to allow for easier
travel to Mars. However, more work
remains to establish whether the
water that has been discovered
will be sufficient for sustaining
or supporting a human lunar
presence.

lix interview. “It’s actually a friend who
is offering pro bono services... Cairbre
Sugrue offered to help. He’s not taken
a single penny for this, and we’ve been
working closely with the University of
Oxford Press Office. But it’s very hard
for the whole University Press Office to
manage the volume of requests, since it’s
a lot of work.”
However, this seems to contradict
what the University of Oxford Press
Office said on this matter to the Byline
Times back in March: “All Oxford ac-
ademics have freedom of expression re-
garding their areas of specialism, includ-
ing communication through the media.
It is therefore not uncommon for aca-
demics to make their own arrangements
for contacting the press. The university
cannot comment on individual arrange-
ments that it is not party to”, implying
that they had nothing to do with this ar-
rangement.
The University of Oxford did not re-
spond to Felix’s request for comment.
A PLEA FOR
CIVILITY
At the end of the interview, Gupta
insisted that
the debate in
the scientific
community must
be more civil: “I
have suffered a lot
for this. It’s been
terrible. I’ve had
horrible personal
attacks made.
It’s been a real
embarrassment
to me and my
family, and it’s
been very tough...
They’re saying I’m a puppet, that I’ve
been manipulated by some group to say
these things which really, really is a very
serious allegation. A very serious slur on
my character.” She went on about how
her interactions with Imperial College
epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, one of
the most prominent proponents of the
consensus strategy, have always been
respectful, in contrast to “a bunch of
people, including at
[my] university,
have decided to
target what we’re
doing along those
lines. I would be
completely open to
scientific criticism,
policy criticism...
But the line of
attack has been
really dramatically
personal.”
The scientific
consensusonCOVIDpolicyseemstobe
clear - while maintaining restrictions like
mandatory masks and a limit on social
gatherings, nations must use tools like
test and trace as well as their enhanced
healthcare systems to keep infections
at bay, and hold out until a safe vaccine
can be accessed by all. While being a
seemingly logical proposal in an ongo-
ing debate, our lack of knowledge about
immunity and the risk of hospitals being
overwhelmed by patients means that im-
plementing the ‘Focused Protection’ ap-
proach is simply too high of a risk in a
situation as dangerous and unprecedent-
ed as the COVID-19 pandemic.
