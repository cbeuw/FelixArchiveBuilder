There are those that believe that
stricter lockdowns will save lives
and there are others that believe that
a different approach is better. Though
I fall into the latter category, I would
like to preface this article by saying that
neither side is evil.
Both sides argue from different points
of principle, but with a common goal: to
save lives. Abuse that is mudslung from
one side of the debate to the other does
nothing but polarise debate and make a
viable solution less likely.
In late March when the UK and over
half of the European countries had
closed the door on the world in order
that they avert the virus and keep oth-
ers safe, the messaging from national
governments was clear: we are locking
you down to increase hospital capacity
and stem the flow of the virus. At this
time, the government had my full sup-
port in its approach; we did not know
of the dangers of this virus and bucking
the global trend was not a political price
worth paying.
And so, from late March, we all did
our duty to our Queen and country
and stayed within our four walls in the
hope that in the meantime, NHS capac-
ity would be ramped up to withstand a
potential inundation of hospitalisations
further down the line.
The government succeeded in this
and save for a couple of hospitals in the
north-west of the capital, not one hospi-
tal was overwhelmed with coronavirus
patients at the peak of the pandemic in
mid April. With the ramping up of ca-
pacity, it wasn’t just the nurses and doc-
torswhowereonthefrontline:thearmy
had been drafted in to assist in the con-
struction of the Nightingale Hospital in
the Excel centre. The capacity was and is
now available and the speed with which
it was done should be commended.
So what is the plan now? If the orig-
inal plan was to ensure our hospitals
were readily equipped for a surge in hos-
pital admissions,
then that has been
achieved. If the
plan is now to
eradicate this vi-
rus altogether and
therefore hold out
for a vaccine, then
I am convinced
we will kill more
people with this
approach than
which we intend
to save.

alled vaccine on

for such a period of time will lay waste
thousands upon thousands of small/me-
dium sized businesses, soar unemploy-
ment figures, and send people’s mental
health into the doldrums. Just this last
week, the suicide preven-
tioncharity,Papyrus,said
that it was “run off
its feet” with 90
percent of all calls
being linked to
the lockdown.
With this in
mind, I now be-
lieve that the
narrative must
shift from fear-
ing this virus to
learning to live
with it. Compro-
mises such as fur-
loughing those that fall into vulnerable
categories during a spike in cases can
be made, but quarantining the entire,
healthy population should no longer be
a viable solution.
Any further lockdowns will delay any
spread rather than prevent it and given
the uncertainty of the emergence of a
vaccine in the next year or so, we can ill
afford to carry on like this.
An alternative approach that I am
pledging my support to is the Great
Barrington Declaration which states its
intention of ‘focused protection’ and
whose signatories include highly ac-
claimed epidemiologists such as Dr Sun-
etra Gupta and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. I
would urge all readers and students alike
to peruse the declaration in their spare
time and share it widely.
Endemic to our society is the corona-
virus, and endemic to life is risk. I now
believe that we must learn to accept this
risk as much as we do every other for a
life without risk, is a life not worth liv-
ing.
