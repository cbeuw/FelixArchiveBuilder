COMMENT
Mr Trump is a climate change
sceptic and has systematically dis-
mantled environmental regula-
tions put in place by former Presi-
dentBarackObama—andactively
defends his decision to exit the
Paris climate accord, which would
have, in his estimation, sacrificed
“tens of millions of jobs, thousands
and thousands of companies.” He
also expresses unreserved support
for fracking, a process for extract-
ing natural gas, and he wishes to
expand on non-renewable energy
and questions the practicality of
alternative energy sources — es-
pecially wind power — over fossil
fuels.
President Trump wants to re-
peal the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
passed under President Obama, which
increased the federal government’s reg-
ulation of the private health insurance
system, including making it illegal to
deny coverage for people with pre-ex-
isting medical conditions. He says he
wants to improve and replace it, al-
though no details of the plan have been
published. The President also aims to
lower drug prices by
allowing imports
of cheaper ones
President Trump has pledged to
create 10 million jobs in 10 months,
and create one million new small
businesses. Mr Trump also promises
to build on the tax cuts he introduced
in his first term, including tax cuts
and credits to entice companies to
keep jobs in the US rather than over-
seas. Mr Trump said he will “enact
fair trade deals that protect American
jobs”,buthardlymentionshowhesees
his trade war with China progressing.
Mr Biden, on the other hand,
supports the universal ban on
fracking, says he is committed
to a ban on “fracking on federal
land.” He plans on taking steps to
confront environmental racism,
and to protect people, especially
in minority communities, who
“live near chemical plants and re-
fineries that pollute.” Mr Biden
has laid out an ambitious climate
plan which includes overhaul-
ing the country’s energy industry
to achieve 100 per cent emis-
sions-free power by 2035. The
plan includes a pledge to invest $2
trillion in clean-energy infrastruc-
ture if Mr Biden wins the White
House in November, along with a
promise to build 1.5 million new
energy-efficient homes and social
housing units. In a nod to liberal
voters, who have been somewhat
unenthusiastic about Mr Biden’s
candidacy, the Democrat said
the expansive climate plan will be
funded by a mix of government
funding and increasing the cor-
porate income tax rate from 21 to
28 per cent to ask “the wealthiest
Americans to pay their fair share”.
Although, he has shied away from
mentioning a ban on fossil fuels
such as oil, coal and gas -
a politically sensitive
topic in battleground
states like Pennsyl-
vania and Michigan
- instead, focusing
on incentives for car
manufacturers to pro-
duce zero-emission
electric ve-
hicles.
Mr Biden wants to protect and ex-
pand the ACA. He wants to lower the
eligibility age for Medicare, the policy
which provides medical benefits to the
elderly,from65to60.Healsowishesto
provide all Americans with the option
to enrol in a public health insurance
plan similar to Medicare.
Mr Biden says he will raise taxes on
the wealthiest Americans, which he de-
fines as those with an income of more
than $400,000 per year (the top 1-2 per
cent). He wants to impose a marginal
tax rate increase – so the more a worker
earns over that threshold, the more tax
they must pay. He supports raising the
federal minimum wage to $15 (£11.50)
an hour from the current rate of $7.25
(£5.50).
