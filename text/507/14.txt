TEN PIN BOWLING
The Club, against all the odds, were first at the Brunei Invita-
tional Handicap Doubles Tournament last Saturday. However, early
arrival meant only having to wait in the cold and did not herald
success in the bowling.
F i v e London University teams entered including three from IC and
it seemed reasonable to expect some s u c c e s s . Halfway through L o n -
don 2 team were close to the lead, Danny L a u rolling a 545 series,
including a 202 game, well supported by 504 from Edmond Ng of
Q E C . The bowling from the rest of the London teams was inconsis -
tent and, on the whole, disappointing due to a mixture of unfamili -
arity with the lanes at the Airport and bad bowling.
The second half continued in a s i m i l a r fashion for London . O n l y
Roland Hsie of U C and Fred Rad found any consistency, although
neither could repeat their first series hi-games of 199 and 196 res-,
pectively .Danny and Eamond rolled 518 and 544, good scores but
nevertheless disappointing considering their recent excellent form .
The other IC bowiers s t i l l struggled to find form .;Varicus
distractions can be blamed for this .Noori won a fistful of
lollipops,|booby prizes for bad bowling, and the C tib C a pain, Pete
Churchyard, was close to winning a wooden spoon with a d i s g r a c e -
ful 9 7 , (we're not going to let him forget that). Tim H i llyer showed,
through his apparent disinterest in b o w l i n g , a preference for w a s t -
ing money on electronic amusement machines.
In the end, 'London 2 came fourth in the scratch competition, be-;-
hind L e e f s . Birmingham and Brunei, and narrowly missing out on a
trophy. Overall .Birmingham and Brunei won most of the trophies,
Fbrtsmouth taking most of the wooden s p o o n s . T h i s tournament was
London's first this year and provided ex perience which should he! p
the team to better resu Its in the tournaments at Leeds and Southamp-
ton later this term .

and hopefully e x c i t i n g , event .More details soon .

Freshers' Snooker Tournament. Imperial College Darts Singles
The two contestants who had Championship. It is open to
reached the final were Steve Jeans a l l Staff and Students of Impâ€”
( P h y s i c s 1) & P h i l Peters (Maths erial College and a l l members
1). In the first frame, both play- ,of I.C. Darts C l u b ,
ers were a bit nervous and made The entry fee is lOp for Darts
a few s l i p s . Steve Jeans finally c l u b members and 20p for n o n -
won it 61 - 29 after making a break members. Entries w i l l be taken
of 15 (brown, blue, pink). The b y t h e b a r s t a f f j n t h e U n i o n .
next two frames were refereed by B a r T h e d r a w i s t 0 b e m a d e o n
our vice-president, Mick (with
the white gloves and mafia c o s -
tume) Maghar. The second frame,
like the first was very even, but
this time, P h i l Peters won 52 6 2 .
In the third frame, Steve started i
to assert himself, and by the time
a l l the reds had been potted, P h i l
needed snookers, which he got,
once on the green, and once on
the blue. Unfortunately for him
though, Steve succeeded to get
out of them, and actually potted
them while doing so. Jeans now
felt the title within h i s grasp,
and stormed into a 27-0 lead. He
finally won 69-9.
So Steve Jeans is this year's
Freshers' Champion. If you have
read this article and have not
understood a word of it, why not
come up to the Snooker Lounge
on the third floor of the Union
building and find out more about
the club? Snooker is a very relax-
ing game, and is one of the most
popular recreations at IC.

ORIENTEERING
A small party of orienteers from
IC took part in the annual " C h i l -
tem C h a l l e n g e " on Sunday near
Wendover. The dense, snow-laden
forest near Wendover was not to
most people's liking and several
of I C ' s more illustrious runners
did not show the form that they
had been showing lately. The
best IC performance came from
Andy Quickfall who finished third
on the B course, and claims to
have thoroughly enjoyed himself
in the process, which left the
test of the club wondering what
he had been doing out in the
depths of darkest, snowy, Oxford-
shire.
CROSS
COUNTRY
L a s t Saturday the C r o s s - c o u n -
try club travelled up to the snowy
wastes of Hampstead Ifeath for the
annual U C 5 race. A race to which
most of the southern U n i v e r s i t i e s
and colleges ate i n v i t e d . Yet
again, Steve K i r k was the first
I . C . runner to f i n i s h in 18th po-
sition (you're getting boring Steve)
R i c h Green had a p l e a s i n g run to
finish in 30th, w h i l s t Ian Morton,
a remnant from the D & D , even -
tually found his co-ordination h a -
lftfay around the course and bom-
bed through the field to f i n i s h
3 4th. Dave Rosen wasn't far be-
hind and he finished 47th. The
other I . C . runners were G a r y Long
- i u r s i (75), R i c h Harrington (79),
Tim ffaywafd (121) , and F r a n c i s
Smith (126).
The I C team finished an ex-
c e l l e n t 4th, just m i s s i n g out on
the.medals, but this was mainly
due to John L e o n a r d of G o l d s m i -
ths who offered to run for u s , and
finished an excellent 12th.
T h i s weekend London U n i v e r -
sity are sending two teams up to
Stirling for the B r i t i s h U n i v e r s i t -
ies Championships. Not surprising
4y Steve K i r k has been selected
