The Idols
I have seen many bands at the N a s h v i l l e
and not once been disappointed. L a s t Sun •
day, the Idols began as though they wantec1
to play to an empty room. The pub was fu.l
at about 9, of people expecting to see War-
ren Harry.However it transpired that one of
the band had been unable to travel back from
Austria for the gig, so The Idols had to take
over, explaining the free entry. On hearing
this, a few left; on hearing the band's first
couple of numbers, even more left. To put
it bluntly, they were disastrous.
1 was just about to join those leaving,
having just finished a pint, when the music
dramatically improved. A fast version of
" T h a t ' s Alright M a m a " with a much tighter
sound, was backed by an effective bass
line and s o l i d drumming.Having kept a few
in the h a l l , mostly sheltering from the rain
or getting pissed, The Idols produced their
best numbers (in my oh-so-humble opinion).
A heavy metal reggae song " K i n g of the Dub*
got a few dancing at the front, then " S p i e s
in the S k y " and " R a d a r ' ' produced good
keyboard work, reminding me initially of Iso-
tope and then of X T C ' s crisp, economic
s t y l e .
The last few numbers of the set were
tight, interesting but unmemorable ranging
from punk to heavy metal. The only things
worth noting were that the bar ran out of
draught beer, and some 21st birthday cele -
brations which turned into an entertaining
faked wrestling match.
If The Idols play near you, i t ' s worth the
trouble to see them (besides i t ' s a good e x -
cuse to go to a pub): - but they're s t i l l n o -
where near as good as Warren Harry.
A dedicated Warren Harry fan (if you hadn't,
guessed).
FILMS
The First Great Train Robbery (AA
Michael Crichton)
Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland and Les-
ley Anne-Down conspire to divert a gold
shipment their way in this lavish costume
drama set in 19th century London. A s a l w -
ays Connery plays that suave (my God I
wish I was him) character who is suited
both to the moments of suspense and the
frequent humour. The plot is typical and
drags in places, but the film is outstanding
due to the fine performances of its stars.
Note; Ronald Biggs does not appear, altho-
ugh I'm sure h e ' l l make money out of it
somehow.
A Wedding ( A A . Robert Attman)
Dino and Muffin get married and return to
their families' home for a lavish and well
prepared reception. T h i s mixture of families
in conflict and wedding officials (notably
some hilarious security guards) is then e x -
ploited to produce a s t y l i s h , well acted com-
edy. Mia Farrow excels as the mentally
retarded sister of the bride. Exactly who
was related to who and how I couldn't work
out, but the film w a s so funny that it didn't
matter. T h i s is well worth a visit to the
cinema.
Jaws 2 (A Zanuck, Brown)
Follow ups are usually Foul ups and
this is so t y p i c a l . If you've seen the o r i g -
inal then the novelty is over and you will
not want to see a bunch of screaming teena-
gers beirvg eaten by a large great white once
more. The cast lacks any outstanding actors
and the only real star is the excellent mech-
anical shark. I didn't like it but perhaps you
w i l l . Don't say you weren't warned.
Capricorn One (A, Peter Hyams)
A highly original and moderately exciting
adventure story, but not " T h e greatest a d -
venture-on earth" as billed. Astronauts who
think they are going to Mars are taken from
the capsule to a deserted military base corre
T V studio. Here they stage a Fake landing
but soon things go wrong and they escape
into the desert. The following chase is the
strongest part of the film and brings it above
the norm. Although the dialogue leaves a lot
to be desired and the story becomes thin in
places, I would s t i l l recommend this as a
very worthwhile night out.
Mark Smith
Mary O'Malley's "Once a Catholic" Wynd
-ham's Theatre, Charing Cross Road, WC2.
When asked to review this play, I must ad-
mit that I didn't really know what to expect.
The title implies farce, and as a rule, I find
little amusement i n it. The play seeks to
conduct a comic investigation into the dog-
mas o f Irish C a t h o l i c i s m , and that i n itself
serves to give good indication of the style
of humour adopted in the portrayal of the
subject. It is set i n Harlesden in the late
fifties, the principle conflicting powers
being portrayed by the nuns running a con-
vent school and the new (?) forming permi-
ssiveness of the fifties, personified by a
" t e d " Character by the name of Derek. In
the midst o f the conflict are the schoolgirls
in attendance at the convent, who (being at
' O ' level age) are seen as equivocators.
A s regards the performance of the play,
the main weaknesses were of a technical
nature. T h e sets were unimaginative, and
the lighting was poor. If one ignores that,
however, and turns one's attention to the
standard of acting, there was an exceptional
standard.
James (Z—cars) E l l i s ' portrayal of the
Guinness consuming, Irish Catholic priest
was convincing and numerous, and Angela
V a l e ' s performance as the straight laced
Mother Peter succeeded i n extracting more
from the written part than one would have
thought possible. The girls were superbly
played, so w e l l , in fact, that I was com-
pletely fooled until I saw the close-ups
outside on the way out. A l l a n Corduner, play
-ing the part of the immoral school boy, how-
ever, was, in spite of being amusing, a poor
choice for the part. H i s acting was not so
much at variance as h i s age, to the extent
that until I noticed the school blazer, I
thought he was Mary Ballagher's father,
instead of her boyfriend.
There is no doubt in my mind that a cat-
holic would find this play far more amusing
than I d i d . Much of the humour is based on
religion, and the intricacies of Catholicism.
Regrettably, the rest of the humour w a s of
a somewhat baser nature. T h i s of course
tends to get more laughs, but i n this case
the lagghs were dearly purchased by stoop-
ing low into the oblivious depths of crudity.
It was mainly this which left me feeling that
a great deal of superb theatrical talent was
being prostituted i n a poor play, but I'm not
a C a t h o l i c !
