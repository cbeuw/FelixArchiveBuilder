As Mike explained what the job of Honorary Secretary entails in
last week's issue, I thoughtj'd better not be outdone .Anybody, (who
can get a proposer and twenty seconders), can stand for President
of Imperial College Union by putting their nomination on to the pa -
pers posted in the Union Lower Lounge from 19th February, (papers
stay up for two weeks). You don't have to be what is generally rer
ferred toas a "Union hack" in order tostand for ICU President,
or indeed, to succeed.
I myself had only ever once been on Union Council and then only
in the often considered lowly position of Department Representative.
Nor do you necessarily have to be the person seen at the most so -
cial events during the year. I had only ever been to one ball before
getting elected, and am only now beginning to understand the whole
social scene.
So what qualities do you need? If you want to get elected the
most important thing is to have some policies and to have some d e -
termination. If you want to succeed and remain sane when you're
elected to the job you mostly need a very thick skin.
The job is basically knowing everything that's going on in the
Union and trying to make sure that all policies of the Union are tra-
nsmitted to the right body and that appropriate action is taken upon
them. Issues you might need to leam something about would of
course include tuition fees, overseas students problems, refectories,
grants policy, accommodation, but of course you need to know gen-
erally how the structure of the Union works and how also the C o l -
lege structure works and how the two relate to each other. Above
all, I suppose, you need to be flexible. The first job that ever hit
me, for instance, was the problem of the Yacht Club, (something that
before now I have always too depressed about to mention). Knowing
nothing whatsoever about yachts (even previosuly getting confused
between dinghies and yachts), it had something of a novelty value.
The problem was that our Yacht Club was in possession of a yacht
bought with some faults in the way that the engine had been fitted.
We were also unsure as to whether there might be other problems
with the yacht, and so right at the beginning of my year of office we
decided to have a survey of the yacht. Then came the problem of
getting the work done so that Yacht Club could start sailing. This
might seem easy enough but a whole number of problems came about
such that in the end we were getting estimates of up to Â£800 for
what should have been some minor work. This went on for seemingly
months and thousands of meetings with different people about what
possibly could be done with this yacht, but eventually the whole
problem was sorted out in December of last year when we got the
'original sellers of the boat to agree to do the remedial repairs to the
yacht.
Aiiuiner problem that just hit me out of the blue was right at the
start of this session when I discovered that there were a number of
people with a problem over grants (which I keep plugging in my ar-
ticles). They were refused a grant because it was claimed they were
not "ordinarily resident" as described in the grant regulations. A
happy ending of that problem has not as yet been achieved. After
hours of letter writing to MP's and talking to the students about the
problem and talking to college authorities about their problems, we
have had a small success in that I am now told that College may be
prepared to waive fees in certain instances for these students.
As well as needing to be able to react to new circumstances and
trying to work out what you can possibly do about them, you also
need as President to be able to initiate ideas and push people along
with ideas that they might have thought of but may be about to forget
about. An example is Welfare Day, when they needed a bit of extra
encouragement to make sure that the date was even fixed although
the idea definitely came from Welfare Committee.
As well as thinking and pushing you have to go along and attend
as many Union Committees as you possible can do in order to remain
in touch with the Union. You are also on the College committees
that are seen as of vital importance to the Union, e-g. Refectory,
Residence committees.
Well that's about it really. It's not exactly a fun job but it is q u -
ite absorbing. Anybody who wants to find out anymore about the job,
drop in and see me anytime.
Refectory Boycott
As I hope you all know by now, the Refectory Boycott is next
Thursday, February 8th, and is of Southside Refectory only. There
| i s an article elsewhere in F E L I X explaining the need for the Refec-
tory Boycott so I won't say any more except to say "Please do take
part, and please also help by picketing if you've got any time at
a l l , "
