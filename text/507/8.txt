The British Army & Ireland
—Join the Army; travel to exotic distant lands; meet exciting, un-
usual people and kill them.
The professional B r i t i s h Army of today can be traced back to the
17th century during the period of the " G l o r i o u s R e v o l u t i o n " .The
reasons for the raising and up-keepof this'first regular force were
the suppression of the Irish people and the defence of the Protest -
ant religion. After the pacification of Ireland, the last dissenters,
the Scottish C l a n s , were first defeated and then decimated by a
period of bloody repression. N e x t came the time of unlimited c o l o n -
i a l conquest, extending the boundaries of the Empire and leaving
the B r i t i s h Army par-excellance a counter-insurgency force.
England first invaded Ireland in 1169 and in 1171 K i n g Henry n
himself v i s i t e d the country to try and assert feudal ties. The pract-
i c a l difficulties of medieval communications across a large expanse
of sea made the Crown's task of supervision difficult but in 1541
Henry\vni went to Dublin and proclaimed himself " K i n g of this
land of Ireland as united, annexed and knit forever to the Imperial
crown of the Realm of E n g l a n d " . The p o l i c y of " p l a n t a t i o n " was
foiumulated to stamp out the characteristics of the native I r i s h .
L a n d s were confiscated and planted with settlers from England and
Scotland. When resistance was encountered the T U D O R S dealt
with it with a ferocity w h i c h , in the words of the great historian
L e c k y " h a s seldom been exceeded in the pages of h i s t o r y " . The
most successful of a l l " p l a n t a t i o n s " was completed in the reign of
James I principally in the s i x of the nine counties of Ulster (1609).
Since the Reformation in England had made no impression on Cath -
o l i c Ireland, the Protestant plantation established a cleavage b e -
tween the two sections of the Irish population and so now religion
determined p o l i t i c a l thinking and set a pattern for the s o c i a l and
p o l i t i c a l development of Ireland right up to the present day. Hence
the s o c a l l e d " R e l i g i o u s D i v i d e " .
In 1641 the Puritan Parliament of England decreed the absolute
suppression of the C a t h o l i c religion in Ireland and in this year a
great rebellion broke out. The effect of the rebellion's final supp -
ression by the Parliamentary forces under Cromwell in 1652 was
devastatingty clear. The terrible suffering which Cromwell inflicted
i n the name of God on a l l C a t h o l i c rebels in Ireland forged for them
something like a single identity and strengthened still further the
cleavage between them and the other (planted Protestant) part of
Ireland's population. During this war one third of the Catholic-Irish
(over 600,000) died and 100,000 were sold as slaves to the West
Indies and other c o l o n i e s . The end result was that more than % of
the cultivable land was to be found in the hands of a small minority
of Protestants (descended from the E n g l i s h and Scottish plantation^
A s a direct result of the potato famine (1845) the population of
Ireland decreased by one half in twenty years with VA million dead,
yet from every part i n Ireland cargoes of o a t s , barley, bacon, eggs,
butter and other foodstuffs continued to s a i l for E n g l a n d . A s agitat-
ion for independence continued through armed struggle there was an
immediate outcry from the Protestant industrial North -East, who
initiated a series of pogroms against the Catholic workers.
In the General E l e c t i o n of 1918 it was obvious that the Majority
of Irish people sought freedom and the British government, having
successfully used " d i v i d e and r u l e " for eight hundred years and,
seeing that they would be unable to defeat the Irish forces, parti -
tioned Ireland leaving s i x of the counties of U l s t e r s as Northern
Ireland and s t i l l part of B r i t a i n . The material basis for this
artificial formation of the North Ireland statelet, against the wishes
of the majority, was the increased pace of c a p i t a l i s t development in
the North East. The policy of divide and rule was carried on by suc-
c e s s i v e U n i o n i s t governments in Northern Ireland and hence the
anomalous situation of U n i o n i s t dominated trade-unions as a l l i e s of
me bourgeoisie. The fundamental c l a s s conflict is exacerbated by
the priveleged a c c e s s of Protestant workers to scarce jobs and so
although both sections of the working c l a s s are exploited, one is
slightly better off than the others, and so the Protestant worker off-
ers allegiance to right-wing bigotted politicans of the same govern-
ment in power for ova fifty years so that he may continue to have
this slightly better situation. F o r over half a century Britain gave
blanket approval to blatant discrimatory practices and repression of
Catholic/nationalist workers and middle c l a s s so that the U n i o n i s t
government would get the support it needed. ;
Fifteen thousand troops continue to h o l d this a r t i f i c i a l l y formed
country for Britain but in the media they are just " k e e p i n g the peace
between the squabbling I r i s h " . B r i t i s h j u s t i c e under the 1973 Emer*.
gency P r o v i s i o n s A c t (E.P«A«) works like this. An 18 years o l d boy
is arrested by the police in B e l f a s t . He is now held for 72 hours
without being charged (section 88 of Part 2 of E . P . A . ) . He i s for-
c i b l y finger printed and photographed (section II of E.P.A«)» H e is
denied access to a s o l i c i t o r and h i s parents are not told he is there
(under E.P.A*)? He is beaten up and forced to sign a confession
(not legal under E . P . A . , ; b u t it happens - Amnesty International). He
is charged with membership of F i a n n a N a H'eireann (illegal under
E J ' . A . i n N . Ireland but not B r i t a i n ) . He spends the next 2 years on
remand before coming to trial (known as internment by remand). The
court has no jury (but an amendment to the E . P . A . ) . He i s assumed
guilty until proven innocent (section 9 of Part 1 of E . P . A . ) . The
evidence is slim, but h e was found to be in possession of a docu-
ment of F i a n n a N a H ' E i r e a n n . That i s enough to convict him
(section 21 of P a r t 3 , " p o s s e s s i o n by a person of a document s h a l l
be evidence of that person belonging to the organisation at the time
when he had the document i n h i s p o s s e s s i o n " . Journalists watch
out!) He is sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.
The British Army is the main instrument that has been u s e d by
successive governments to deny the right of self determination to
A L L the Irish people. Its role i n Ireland is as in Aden, K e n y a e t c . -
not peace-keeping but counter-insurgency.
Not long ago we ruled the world
With cane and bowler hat
Now all we've left is Ulster
And we've trouble holding that.
The public school taught us to rule —
We'll keep those natives down
So don 't call US tyrannical —
We're loyal to the Crown.
CHORUS
Upper class pukka class officers' mess
We've walked on the Irish
Since Good Queen Bess,
A kick in the knackers will make 'em confess,
Upper class, pukka class, born to oppress....
They say Strasbourg may condemn US —
How dare THEY interfere?
You take Sir Edward Compton's word —
// never happened here.
It's all right to kick an Irishman,
We say it without shame.
It's just part of our tradition —
Play the Man, and Play the Game.
