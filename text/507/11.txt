Ents D i s c o
A request has been made by E n t s to use
the Lower Lounge for their Friday night d i s -
cos (instead of the Refectory), s o that there
w i l l be a bar at one end of the room. T h i s
has been agreed by the E x e c . f o r a 3 week
trial period starting next week, and the e n -
try charge w i l l be reduced to 10p.
One of the doors to the lounge h a s had to
be closed due to floor repairs which are
being done at the moment . T h e wooden floor
beneath the lino around the bar has rotted,
and it is uncertain how long repair work is
going t o take.
Prowler
A s most of you have probably heard by
now, a man has been causing trouble in the
Union and Beit by going into L a d i e s ' toilets.
He is thought to be the same person who
appeared during the summer, and a good des-
cription has been obtained and given to the
P o l i c e and C o l l e g e Security as follows:
Half-caste negroid, short dark, frizzy hair,
about 6' 1 " , 2 5 years old, w e l l built, clean
shaven with a rough complexion.
Liberal C l u b Newspaper
Liberal C l u b ' s newspaper, " F o r w a r d f
(better known as " S i d e w a y s " in the Union
Office) which appeared two weeks ago h a s
caused quite a lot of controversy mainly due
to an article which c r i t i c i s e d certain media
organisations (and two individuals in part-
icular). Whilst I feel that some of the c o m m -
ents made were valid(and should have been
said a long time ago), and that freedom of
editorial policy for political society n e w s -
papers must be preserved, I have doubts
about the value of attacks on particular
people who have done a lot of work for the
Union , especial ly when this is done w i t h -
out prior notice to the individuals involved.
I have no complaints about the comments
made about myself, except that two of the
items were out of date, (as recognised by
ICU C o u n c i l ) .
Elections - D . P .
Are you a dynamic, extrovert type of p e r -
sron who enjoys a real challenge? Bored wifh
mundane efforts such as climbing Everest,
doing the 4-minute mile, and being industri-
al Relations manager for British Leyland?
Could you try to run a Union and get a degr-
ee at the same time?
Could y o u be a Deputy President?
There i s , of course, a chance that by next
year D . P . could be made s a b b a t i c a l . I've
heard some people saying that if it becomes
sabbatical i t ' l l be a " d o s s " job; nothing
could be further from the truth. A lot of extra
responsibilities would be involved, arid it
always has been and always w i l l be the
hardest job in the Union due to the nature
of the work involved.
Either w a y , anyone who is thinking of
standing for the job should come and see me
in the Union Office soon. I'm not going to
give a detailed job description in F E L I X 'cos
it's too boring for words, and I'd rather talk
to anyone interested personally. Besides
w h i c h , anyone capable of doing it should
already have enough knowledge of the
Union to have a good idea of what is i n v o l -
ved.

Cadmium Findings in Shipham - imperial's Role
For the villagers of Shipham in Somerset
the presence of large amounts of cadmium in
their soil suddenly became a major talking
point when the Department of the Environ-
ment announced two weeks ago that it was
going to carry out thorough medical examin-
ations and test the soil and house dust in
the village.
But for s c i e n t i s t s in Imperial C o l l e g e ' s
Geology Department the flurry of activity
and media attention w a s just a temporary
diversion in a research programme which
has been going on for many years.
The s c i e n t i s t s concerned belong to the
Applied Geochemistry Research Groups, a
multi-disciplinary group including geolo -
gists, geochemists, s o i l s c i e n t i s t s and
analytical c h e m i s t s . Founded in 1954 by
Professor J . S . W e b b i t s aim i s to research
methods and techniques of using geochem-
istry for mineral exploration, agricultrue,
pollution and other aspects affecting the
community . A b o u t 50 people are involved
including 20 postgraduates research s t u d -
ents .
A n important part of the Group's wotk
over the last ten years has been the pro-
duction of the " W o l f s o n Geochemical A t l a s
of England and W a l e s " , under the direction
of Professor Webb and funded by the Wolfson
Foundation . P u b l i s h e d by the Clarendon
Subsequent research funded by the Natural
Environment Research C o u n c i l focused
attention on the Mendip H i l l s where some
sites were found containing large amounts cf
cadmium. T h i s work was followed by a pro -
gramme funded by R i o Tinto Z i n c to look at
the detailed distribution and dispersion of
cadmium in selected ares. Part of this work
was directed to Shipham.
Cadmium Sources
There are three sources of cadmium c o n -
tamindation in s o i I s : natural geological
sources, present day industrial activity and
past mining and smelting. Cadmium is always
found in conjunction with z i n c . In the S h i p -
ham area zinc ore, mainly calamine (zinc
carbonate), had been mined from Roman times
to the end of the last century, and the IC
researchers found that part of the village
had been built on reclaimed mine w o r k i n g s .
A l a n Marples, then a postgraduate s t u d -
ent with the Group, mapped out the extent
of the cadmium distribution in Shipham and
established that its source w a s the o l d zinc
m i n e s . T h e amount of cadmium in the s o i l
varied from about 30 to several hundred parts
per m i l l i o n , compared with a national aver-
age of about one part per m i l l i o n . So far
Shipham is the only area where such high
levels of cadmium have been found.
These findings caused concern because
Press in September 1978 it comprises region- cadmium is a toxic metal capable of caus
al geochemical maps showing the distribu -
tion of 21 metals over England and Wales.
It is the first publication of its k i n d .
Work on the maps started in 1969 with the
c o l l e c t i o n of 50,000 stream sediment
samples at an average density of one per
square m i l e . Subsequent research by the
Group has been concerned with the presen-
tation of the maps a n d their interpretation
for a variety of a p p l i c a t i o n s . Among these
are the study of trace elements for a g r i c u l -
ture, and applications in water resources
management, pollution studies and public
h e a l t h .
One of the metals mapped w a s cadmium.
ing disease and even death if ingested in
smal I quantities. Cadmium contamination
caused an outbreak of a serious disease
known as itai-ttai in Japan between 1962
and 1968. T h i s condition is characterised
by painful joints and brittleness of the bones
It can lead to the c o l l a p s e of the skeleton
and death.
The level of cadmium present in Shipham
s o i l s is higher than that found in Japan but
no c a s e s of itai-itai are known to have o c -
curred. There are several environmental dif-
ferences between Japan and Shipham which
could account for t h i s . In the case of S h i p -
ham it i s thought that little of the cadmium
is taken up from the s o i l into grass and veg-
etables. The presence of z i n c may hinder
the uptake of cadmium into plant roots. In
Japan, on the other hand, cadmium was tak-
en up by rice growing on the contaminated
flood planes, which constituted one of the
staple items of the local diet.
Further Research
The Applied Geochemistry Research G r -
oup is continuing to work in Shipham. Hilary
Matthews, a postgraduate, is carrying out an
in-depth study of the forms of cadmium c o n -
tamination, and a postdoctoral research as -
sistant is working on the effects of cadmium
on nitrogen-fixing bacteria in agricultural
s o i l s . It is expected that Imperial College
will a l s o be involved in the survey of s o i l
and house dust announced by the Department
of the Environment.
Dr. Ian Thornton, Reader in Environmenta
Chemistry, is responsible for the Group's
environmental programme and has borne the
brunt of the sudden public interest in the
researchers' findings. He has been on the
receiving end of a stream of 'phone c a l l s
from the media ever s i n c e the 1,200 S h i p -
ham villagers were urged to stop eating v e -
getables grown in their gardens and give up
heavy smoking. Smoking is considered d a n -
gerous as a l l smokers absorb a small amount
of cadmium from tobacco anyway. D r . T h o r n -
ton emphasises that the high level of c a d -
mium in the s o i l is a cause for concern but
not alarm. H e considers that a thorough s c i -
entific study of the v i l l a g e r s ' environment
and health is needed.
The villagers themselves appear not to
be unduly alarmed. F i r s t indications are
that nobody has suffered from serious c a d -
mium poisoning and villagers point out that
many of them have lived to a ripe o l d age.
They appear to be more concerned about the
effect of the scare on property values and
are rather annoyed at the way the affair has
been publicised by the media.
