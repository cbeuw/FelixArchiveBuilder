Why Abortion ?
Positive Alternatives to Abortion (P.A.T.A.)
Is an affiliated society of the University of London Student Union.
This article is to tell you what it stands for and what it hopes to
achieve.
We believe that s o c i e t y ' s obligations towards its members should
begin when their lives begin, at conception. We believe that any
attempt to establish some time after conception when society should
suddenly take up the responsibility for protecting life is both irrat-
ional and, in the long run, impossible. Irrational because there are
no serious grounds for saying that life begins after conception, and
impossible because the problems which make the unborn unwanted
are no less serious after birth and the arguments used to justify
abortion must one day, in a l l conscience, be used to justify infan-
ticide and compulsory euthanasia.
We believe that when pregnancies are unwanted our response
should be to remove the evils in society which make them unwanted,
rather than to remove the unborn who are not responsible themselves
for anything that is e v i l .
We intend to use a l l democratic means available to persuade s o -
ciety round to the6e v i e w s . In particular we intend to campaign
against the 1967 Abortion A c t and the present Union policy of free
abortion on demand. Our aim is to campaign for the provision of
positive alternatives to abortion.
The Abortion A c t specifies " t h e risk of serious handicap at
b i r t h " as one of the circumstances in which abortion may be legal.
Recently this clause has been more widely used with the gradual
development of techniques for seeking out the blind or deaf or c r i -
ppled before their birth in order that they may be k i l l e d .
We propose that rather society change itself so that the handi-
capped are accepted as equal c i t i z e n s with a contribution as v a l u -
able as anyone e l s e ' s , in some ways even more valuable. One part-
icular part of society which needs changing in this way is the U n i -
versity of London. With a l l the sports, s o c i a l and cultural f a c i l i t -
ies offered to students here, how has it been that so-little is done
to make the University truly a c c e s s i b l e to handicapped students?
We intend to campaign that this should be amuch higher priority
both for University money and student's union activity.
The problems which face a s i n g l e parent family are often used to
justify abortion. We propose, rather, that abortion is one of the
reasons why society so often evades its r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s to these
families, why, for example, the 40,000 students of London Univer-
sity have only a maximum of 143 nursery places available for the
children they have or may want to have. The issues are inseparably
linked. Nurseries are expensive, abortions cheap, and a society
which permits and encourages the destruction of its most awkward
members before their birth w i l l always have the perfect excuse for
disregarding them afterwards. P . A . T . A . has no such excuse. T h i s
is why we intend to take up and join in the campaigns for h a n d i c a -
pped students and College Nurseries.
P . A . T . A . has no party political or religious affiliations. Member-
ship is open to all who would like to register their beliefs on this

Well It is Monday again (it is
for me) as I sit down at my type-
writer, knowing that a l l you out
there are waiting impatiently for
this prosaic gem, and decide I've
got better things to do then to
keep you amused during lectures,
so hard l u c k .

turn up at Falmouth kitchen tonidit
between the hours of ten and e l e -
ven carrying a piece of whatever
turns them on on w h i c h they have
inscribed the answer to the ques-
tion to be found near the foot of
this article w i l l receive any p e r -
mutation of the following cooked
to their own instructions.
a) C u p of soup (flavour to be
decided)
b) P i e c e of bread (white or brown)
c) B i s c u i t (choice of flavours)

If you would l i k e some help
then ring int 4162 anytime that
I'm in and I ' l l tell you the answer,

Chem. P C .
A number of postgraduates m u a
have had their research affected
by the recent t e c h n i c i a n s ' dispute.
One P G who was unable to do
any experimental work for two
months has informed me that he
is applying for a two month ex-
tension to h i s grant to make up
for the time lost.
If you think you can argue that
your work was unavoidably held
up for this period there may be a
chance that your grant awarding
body ( S R C , N E R C , e t c ) w i l l c o n -
sider an extension. It may come
to nothing but it i s worth a try.
The Postgraduate Group would
like to coordinate applications
and to know whether any are s u -
c c e s s f u l so that we can pass on
this information to other P G s . If
anyone has applied or decides to
do so, c o u l d they please contact
me or any member of the IC P G
Group Committee.
