CROSS
COUNTRY
The IC Cross-Country Club
took full advantage of the snowy
weather last week to take a clear
lead in the London Colleges L e a -
gue. Whilst other teams struggled
to Guildford by iced-up Southern
Region, we motored down by mini-
bus to find ourselves racing aga-
inst a very depleted field.
The non-appearance of C a p -
tain Ian A l v e y provoked some com
menu It was rumoured that he was
in bed with ' F l u (a lady from I F
I believe), and there were mutinous
rumblings amongst the troops.
The University of Surrey course,
notorious for i ts ploughed f i e l d s ,
was four inches deep in snow,
making the going even tougher
than u s u a l . Those who wore flat
soled shoes were almost reduced
to a l l fours for the uphill stretch -
e s . The Duke of Kent dextrously
started the race by dropping a flag
and firing a gun simultaneously,
and the runners floundered off,
j u s t as the Barts and half the U C
team arrived by t a x i .
Maurice Wilson was overcome
by injury and was forced to retire
after a lap, but despite t h i s , the
I C teams returned their best per-
formances of the s e a s o n . Steve
K i r k headed the team in 9th place,
followed by newcomer Mark P i c k -
ard (12th) whose main hobby of
L o n g Distance Walking obviously
gets him f i u Ian Morton (13th)
held off Mike K e l l y (16th), w h i l s t
Bryan A c o r d c l o s e d the team in
18th p o s i t i o n . D a v i d R o s e n found
himself relegated to the unusual
position of 'spacer' i n 20th place,
and the B team was headed by
P e t e Barry (30th) having an e x -
cellent run. B e h i n d h i m , Gary
Longhurst (33rd), T i m Hayward
(64th) and Frances Smith (82nd)
completed the team.
With one league race left, IC
A team are in a commanding 40
ipoint lead over L S E and U C , w h i t
I st I C B team look set to a v o i d re -
legation yet a g a i n , as they occupy
8th p l a c e .
Regular readers of this column
i w i l l know that the starter for l e a -
I gue races i s not u s u a l l y a royal
personage. Nobody seemed to k n -
ow why we were so honoured on
this o c c a s i o n , and i t was a pity
he didn't have time to stay and
see the spectacle of the IC team
finishing. However, it i s rumour-
e d that Ian Morton i s currently
engaged in negotiations with Buck
-ingham P a l a c e to book a starter'
for the final league race in 2!4
weeks time,

RUGBY
I.C. Ist 3
Kings Ist 4
First of all apologies for forgetting to wr-
ite up this match in last week's F E L I X .
However it was a blessing in disguise be-
cause It gives me a match to report this
week! Due to the weather conditions each
of our last three games has been cancelled,
with the next match also looking doubtful.
Anyway we jumped in the coach for the
above match (a couple of weeks ago now)
and duly arrived at C o l l i e r ' s Wood. To most
people's surprise the pitch was in relatively
good condition though there was a cold wind
blowing (yes - even " t o u g h " rugby players
cringe at the thought of cold fingers etc.)
With the match underway K i n g s were on
the attack but failed to find their way to the
L i n e due to some good covering play from
I.C. Every ten minutes or so saw I.C. putting
together a good three-quarter movement thus
putting us back into their half. It was a l l to
no avail though and Kings finally scored
after a mistake near our L i n e led to a scrum-
mage five yards out.
In the second-half I.C. began to put things
together but found, as Kings had earlier,
that actually scoring was not so easy.
Anyway, to end a boring account-of an
equally boring match we finally scored a
penalty goal from Eddy Budgen. (The truth
of It is that I can't remember much of what
happened!)
Tomorrow s e e s I.C. playing against S a r a -
cens in the morning then off to Twickenham
in the afternoon for the International - s o
even if the match is called off again, I.C.
rugby w i l l be sending a team to an Inter-
national -not bad eh!
Sponsored Wall-wash
Valentine's day is the day for I . C . R . F . C ' s
sponsored 24-hour wall-wash in the Union
Building and as a result 25 or so big fellas
are wandering around looking for sponsors.
If they nab you please_(for your own safety)
sponsor them.
Half the money raised w i l l be going to
Rag and the other half to help pay for trans-
port costs on our Easter Tour. (Southport by
the way -what do you mean where's that!)

TEN TORS
As some of the more observant members
of RCS will know, for the past three years
the RCSU has entered at least one team in
the annual ' T e n Tors' event.
'Ten Tors' is essentially a matter of Pit-
ting oneself against the clock,in an attempt
to cover a specified course across the was*
es of Dartmoor..
The name of the event, which is organised
and marshalled by the Army, derives from the
fact that a l l the participating teams must
v i s i t ten checkpoints, situated upon Tors
(rocky outcrops), regardless of which route
is followed. These checkpoints are manned
by the army, who keep a keen eye on the two
thousand or so participating young men and
women, u s i n g radio sets to pass on informa-
tion to the team managers at H Q., and to
order helicopters to recover the inevitable
occasional c a s u a l t y .
This year R C S U has applied to enter 3
teams: 2 men's teams, and 1 woman's. Only
by virtue of our s u c c e s s in former years are
we able to enter the event at a l l , s i n c e com-
petition for entry gets fiercer every year.
The two men's teams w i l l by doing fifty
five mile routes, w h i l s t the girls w i l l do a
thirty five mile route. Every team starts at
7 D 0 am on Saturday, and must have finished
or stopped by about 5.00 pm on the Sunday.
Saturday night i s spent camping out on the
moor, so that it is vital for everyone to have
taken absolutely everything with them, that
they need for survival on the moor.
No one who has taken part in Ten Tors
would pretend that it was a holiday - it can
be incredibly tiring, especially for the soles
of the feet. (It has even been known for cer-
tain persons to have been carried to the
nearest bar at nights for days afterwards).
However, for anyone who enjoys fell w a l k -
ing, camping, and the challenge of the moor,
this is an event not to be m i s s e d .
There are no p r i z e s , since there are no
winners, but the feeling of satisfaction
afterwards makes it all worthwhile. Comm-
emorative medals are awarded to a l l those
who complete the course, and should a com-
plete team make it all the way round, they
receive a certificate.
Todate, we have only managed to win one
such certificate, thanks to last year's g i r l s !
So - if any of you budding RCS persons
fancy the idea of taking part this year, there
w i l l be a meeting on Monday 5th February
above Stan's bar, starting between 7.00 -
7.30 p-m.
Y o u may be interested to know that three
of the last three R C S Presidents have reach
â€¢ed that d i z z y height v i a a place in a Ten
Tor team!

Water
Polo
On Sunday 21st IC played their first match
of the term against Walton Water Polo Club.
The team had not been able to practise -
due to the pool not being heated and were
therefore rather unfit. After confusion with
transport we did arrive at the Walton Pool
with twelve willing players.
In the first quarter we showed our s u p -
erior experience and with accurate p a s s i n g
were able to set up some good shots at goaL
P a u l H i n d l e scored our first and Dave D u n -
stone followed that up with a powerful shot
after swimming up the centre of the pool.
The score was put up to 4:0 with two goals
one from Steve Taylor and another from Da\e.
In the second quarter P a u l got another goal
with a good shot from " m i d f i e l d " . Dave got
another two to make his total up to four.
Walton tried very hard to push tip and score,
but due to tight marking they were unable to
break free, and when they d i d Dave Roberts
our goalie saved some good shots. In the
third quarter no goals were scored, i n the
fourth Tony Rockingham got our last goal
to make the f i n a l score 8:0 to u s .

D. Chadwick, M. Cherry.
On Tuesday 23rd I.C. first team played
its first game i n the U . L . U . League against
Marys.
We didn't get off to a very good start.
During our warm up before the game B r i a n
D a v i e s , our goalie, got h i s finger d i s l o c a t -
ed by a shot at goal. He was therefore unab-
le to play and we were left without a goalie.
In the first quarter,play went back and
forward up the pool until Marys scored the
!first goal. I . C . broke back and Dave D u n s -
itone was awarded a penalty, which he got.
! Marys came back and scored another before
I the end of the quarter.
In the second quarter Dave Dunstone got
h i s second goal after a lucky p a s s . Marys
scored again and in the third quarter they
scored another. Tony Rockingham scored
; our l a s t goal after breaking from h i s man.
i l n the f i n a l quarter Marys scored three,
each getting past our substitute goalies
without much difficulty! The final score was
17:3 jo M a r y s .
I Team: S. Tayler, D .Dunstone, P. Mills, T.
I Rockingham, M.Casey,N. Buckland, B .Br-
adley. ,iD. Papaconstantinou, (B. Davies).
