Dear Sir, - A s expected, the art -
i c l e o n the media at I C i n the
last i s s u e of F O R W A R D ! gener -
ated considerable controversy, in
particular from those intimately 1
involved i n the running of the
media.
In the case of I C Radio, I am
bound to say that I feel that the
response of John A l l e n , the s t a -
tion manager, in threatening me
with a l i b e l suit, was something
of an over-reaction. I w i l l agree
with him that, in places, the art-
i c l e was not strictly correct and,
for t h i s , I apologise to John and
h i s staff for any distress caused.
However, I do feel that the spirit
of what was written was e s s e n -
tially v a l i d . ;
Both John A l l e n and P a u l John-
son (Chairman of STOIC) have put
their point of view in replies to
our article w h i c h were printed i n
last week's issue of F E L I X . T h -
ere are j u s t two points that I .
would like to make i n response to
these.
F i r s t , neither I nor I C L i b e r a l
C l u b treat F O R W A R D ! as ' a joke*.
If other members of I C U choose
to do so, then that i s their pre-
rogative, but I attempt to ensure
that the articles are generally
both stimulating and pertinent to
students at Imperial C o l l e g e .
Second, no member of I C U can
place themselves above criticism,
e s p e c i a l l y when they are involved
in a c l u b or society using a c o n -
siderable amount of U n i o n money.
That goes for myself as w e l l as
for John A l l e n and P a u l J o h n s o n .
The important point i s that the
right to c r i t i c i s e these people, be
i t favourable or unfavourable crit-
i c i s m , is upheld at a l l c o s t s .
Yours s i n c e r e l y ,
P a u l F a i r b a i m (Editor F O R W A R D !

Dear Sir, - I am writing; with r e -
ference to the article which a p p -
eared i n last week's F E L D C on
the subject of "Welfare Day &
S e x " . In this article we find
l i s t e d several ways of avoiding
pregnancy, one of w h i c h , implied
to be " e x t r e m e " , i s that of a b s -
tinance. It seems a pity that this
particular method should be r e l e -
gated to this " e x t r e m e " position
considering the following : -
It i s 100% effective (100% in
practice.)
There' i s no danger of side ef-
fects.
No cost i s involved,
No medical advice i s required
and l a s t l y ,
Those who use this method w i l l
suffer no guilt.
It i s hardly surprising that abs-
tention i s so s u c c e s s f u l c o n s i d -
ering that this is G o d ' s standard
outside marriage. It i s a l s o to be
expected that when we deviate
from G o d ' s standards we shall
encounter many of the problems
outlined i n this a r t i c l e .
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir, - " A B l o w F o r I C U : G r -
owing U p ! " A s you might realise
this is a composite of two head-
ings which appeared i n F E L I X
N o . 506 in the Welfare Supplement.
May I just make a few comments
on these two?
Concerning *A B l o w F o r I C U ' , •
the article advertising welfare
day went on to say: " T h i s week
Imperial College U n i o n w i l l plumb
the depths in its s t r i v i n g for pub-
licity as it brings you ... 'The
great condom blowing competition'.
The prize for humiliating yourself
in p u b l i c i s a bottle of W h i s k y . "
I must say that the ingenious
word structure of this advertise-
ment was very good however one
or two things need to be mention-
e d . The fact that I C U is plumbing
the depths in its striving for pub-
l i c i t y is very true, however I t h i -
nk i t has plummeted too far! T e l l
me honestly, how many people at
I.C. want to get into the public
eye because of 'Condom B l o w i n g
Competitions?! H o w would you
reader and E d i t o r l i k e to go for
an interview and be recognised
as a student from the college
where they have such competitons
for publicity stunts?
The continuation of the adver-
tisement is also true, but i t does
not only humiliate the winner but
affects every person at I.C. H o w
can the U n i o n put on such an
event which i s going to affect
every single person at college
without a s k i n g the students if
they want it? If this i s the best
I C U can do I think we should a b a -
ndon the idea of letting I C U get
involved in the first place . T e l l
me if I'm wrong but I thought w e l -
fare was for the good of people,
not to their detriment.
•Concerning the other article
'Growing U p * , I have not seen the
film so cannot comment on that
but I have had nearly 22 years of
growing up 'experience', maybe
you've had more, then you might
be w i s e r arid be able to correct
me if I'm wrong. In those years I
learnt that growing up i s being
able to cope with and control new
situations as we encounter them.
However many people seem to
think that we should not be guid-
ed by our mind but by our body
and its desires. ;
After reading the article on Wel-
fare and S e x , which could have
been a bit more discreet, I must
say that I hope not many people
w i l l have the need of making use
of it. Is sex the be a l l and end
all of a relationship? G i r l s , and
may be some boys, i s it nice to
go out with someone because
they want your body? Isn't i t much
more wonderful to be loved for
what y o u are, or has the word
love become so tainted to be u n -
able to be used?
Doesn't sex lead to guilt and
not happiness? G o d instituted sex
to be w i t h i n marriage, why have
we made such a mess of it? The
B i b l e puts i t l i k e this: " S i n c e
man d i d not think it worthwhile
to retain the knowledge of God,
'He gave them over to a depraved
mind, to do what ought not to be •
d o n e . " God i s the only One who
can satisfy the need that i s deep
within u s , now to my thinking
this is good news and should be
talked about on welfare day. Judge
for yourself
Yours sincerely,
Stephen R . Lane
Dear Sir, - I would like to explain
briefly my reasons for challenging
the chair at the end of the l a s t
U , G , M , as many of the people I
have spoken to since were a l i t -
tle confused as to the purpose of
this. A procedural motion had
been proposed that the meeting
move to,a vote and accepted by
the Chairman. Although this i s
occasionally used at a U . G . M . it
i s not i n fact one of the allowed
procedural motions. It is u s u a l l y
taken as meaning that the meeting
votes directly on whether they
wish to vote on the matter being
d i s c u s s e d at that time, which on
this occasion was an amendment
to the housing motion. A s
the time
was then 14.25 it was l i k e l y that
the few remaining people at the
meeting would be i n favour of mo-
ving directly to a vote. I felt that
there had been insufficient time
to d i s c u s s the amendment and
challenged the Chairman's ruling
on acceptance of the procedural
motion intending to propose i n -
stead that the question be adjour-
ned to the next meeting, so the
d i s c u s s i o n could be continued.
The motion on housing i s pro-
bably the most important to be
placed before a U . G . M . this year
as it could directly affect a l l
students who do not live at home.
I strongly urge that members of
the Union do not a l l o w a handful
of people at an inquorate Union
meeting make a d e c i s i o n on it.

Dear Sir, - M i s s K e a r s e y ' s letter
in F E L I X Dec .15th has prompted
me to clarify bellringing arrange -
ments at I C . H i e Queen's T o w e r
belongs to the Crown and not I . C .
Permission must therefore be ob -
tained from it before ringing takes
place . T h e bells are rung about 6
times per year by the " A n c i e n t
Society of College Y o u t h s " . The
ringing occasions are p u b l i c i s e d
in " I . C . D i a r y " and any ringer
meeting at the Tower-doors at the
advertised time, w i l l u s u a l l y be
allowed to ring by the college
youths.
The University of London So -
ciety of Change Ringers meets •
every Thursday evening at 6.45
at St. Olaves Church, Tower H i l l
(Tower H i l l Tube). R i n g i n g ranges
from plain bob to spliced surprise
major and a l l new ringers w i l l be
made most welcome. F o r further

Sir,- Is it too much to ask, that
the organisers of Dinners and e x -
tracurricular lectures at the coun-
try's foremost scientific C o l l e g e ,
should be capable of co-ordinating
events so that Clashes are minim-
ised?
C l e a r l y , this i s not too much if
one of the events i s of sufficient
prestige - for example Prof. Brad-
l e y ' s inaugural lecture or G u i l d s
D & D . Why then should we have
to choose between a lecture on
E i n s t e i n ( A s s o c . Studies) or Pro£
John Taylor lecturing on h i s ver-
sion of P h y s i c s (Mopsoc) ? Worse,
though, i s yet to come - turning to
the 9th of February in my d i a i y ,
I find myself having to choose
between dinners organised by Dra-
msoc, F E L I X , and a*gain, Mopsoc.
:Where w i l l it end? Is i t too much
to a s k that the bookings office i n
Sherfield should as a matter of
course inform a society booking a
lecture theatre of other lectures
or talks on the same day? Would
it also be too difficult for a l l so-
cieties to inform a specific U n i o n
officer of dates planned for dinn -
ers - p r o v i s i o n a l or definite and
for h i m , i n return to keep that s o -
ciety informed of possible clashes,
as they are notified to him? Sucha
a procedure is not difficult and
the l a c k of i t merely puts us on a
par with p r o v i n c i a l U n i v e r s i t i e s
such as MIT and Melbourne, so
please, somebody, do it.
Yours faithfully,
K.J . Fenning
Dear Sir, - A s a relatively new
member of staff of this C o l l e g e ,
who has just had my bicycle s t o -
len while it was chained to the
railings outside Mech. E n g . , I
would l i k e to appeal to any other
v i c t i m s of bicycle-theft at Imper-
i a l College to join me in protest-
ing against the appalling l a c k of
safe b i c y c l e parking f a c i l i t i e s i n
the College, and the nonchalant
attitude of security staff to this
problem.
Imperial College is notorious
with the l o c a l p o l i c e for being an
easy target for b i c y c l e theft. Wi-
th the high cost of fares and wor-
sening transport services i n L o n -
don, the bike i s a cheap, clean
and healthy alternative way to
travel.
I suggest that b i c y c l e parking
f a c i l i t i e s outside or inside the
C o l l e g e , supervised by an atten-
dant, be provided.
How many staff and students
bring bikes to the College each
day? T h i s substantial number of
people have a right to a safe
place to leave their b i c y c l e s at
the C o l l e g e .
T h e following have already ex-
pressed support.
