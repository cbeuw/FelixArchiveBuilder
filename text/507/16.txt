C O U N C I L R E P O R T
The Deputy President of Imperial College Union may become a
sabbatical post next session (1978^9) despite the College's deci-
sion that no extra money will be available to the Union.
A decision by IC U n i o n C o u n c i l on Monday to set up a fourth s a b -
batical post and find the means to pay for it from existing income
came after the Union F i n a n c e Committee had d i s c u s s e d several po-
ssible sources of finance.
No decision on how to raise the necessary money has been taken,
but four ideas are being investigated:
- Income from room bookings
- The setting up of a l o c a l discount scheme
- Bookshop income.
- G i v i n g a l l sabbatical officers only three free terms in h a l l - they
would have to pay for the fourth.
The e x i s t i n g sabbatical union posts are President, Honorary S e c -
retary and F E L I X Editor. The sabbatical Deputy President w i l l take
on the work of the Honorary Junior Treasurer in addition to his
existing t a s k s .
Departmental Representatives
C o u n c i l agreed a job d e s c r i p -
tion for Departmental Representa-
tives, drawn up by the A c a d e m i c
Affairs Committee. A Departmen-
tal Representative exists to re-
present the views of the student
members of the department, a c c -
ording to the job description, wh -
i c h goes on to l i s t eleven araas
of concern to the Dep. Rep. i n v o -
l v i n g his job within his depart-
ment and his role in Imperial C o l -
lege Union and the Constituent
meeting of 15 per cent of the U n -
ion membership in a department
should be empowered to d i s m i s s
their Representative by a simple
majority vote. No d i s m i s s a l pro-
cedure exists at present.
Freshers' Reception
The nature of the freshers' re-
ception at the beginning of the
autumn term was the subject of a
motion to C o u n c i l proposed by
Academic Affairs Officer Roger
Stotesbury. He was concerned that
the interruptions to speeches at
the reception and the "excessive
College U n i o n s .
A n IC Union General Meeting is ly silly behaviour" was harmful
to be asked to approve a bye-law to the reputation of I C U and sug-
change laying down the procedure gested that interruptions to spee
by w h i c h a Dep. Rep. may be d i s - ches should not be permitted,
m i s s e d . It is suggested that a C o u n c i l disagreed with Roger
Stotesbury's firm line but passed
an amended motion which s a i d t h -
at "the introduction of freshers
to IC Union should be as inform -
al as possible," Many C o u n c i l
members felt, however, that the
informality should remain within
reasonable limits and it was ag-
reed that only C o u n c i l members
and mascot bearers should sit
on the platform at the reception.
Pots
Several proposals from IC p u b -
l i c a t i o n s , clubs and societies and
the Union Welfare Officer for pots
in the Union Bar led to C o u n c i l
deciding that the whole question
of pots be d i s c u s s e d fully at the
next C o u n c i l meeting. A problem
has arisen because there is a
shortage of space behind the bar
and U n i o n Secretary Mike E l k i n
is to investigate the matter.
C o u n c i l agreed that the a c c u -
sations about Deputy President
Malcolm Brain made i n F O R W A R D ,
the IC L i b e r a l C l u b Newsletter,
were objectionable. F O R W A R D
had claimed that Malcolm B r a i n
had caused noise in the Bert Quad
in the early hours of the morning
and was "one of the biggest p * *
artists at IC" .
A suggestion that C o u n c i l shou
•Id resume an earlier practice of
holding one meeting per s e s s i o n
in Silwood was agreed in principle
subject to ratification. The date
put forward for this trip was 14th
May.
NEWS IN BRIEF AROUND COLLEGE
contd. from front page
Mr. Dilipkumar, who is coloured,
tol d a F E L T X reporter that he had
applied for the job in order to
test whether the company lived
up to its c l a i m that it endeavours
"to fulfil the aspirations of each
racial group".
However, because the company
was aware of the letter and, a c -
cording to Mr. Dilipkumar, had
been told by Dr. Harris at the o u ^
set that h i s job application was
not genuine, Mr. Dilipkumar was
not given a proper interview, he
told F E L I X . Instead the intervi-
ewer attacked him over the c o n t -
ents of the letter saying that the
claims made were untrue and that
the company would be recruiting
coloured people from Britain as
w e l l as whites.
A s a result U n i o n President
Mary Attenbotrmgh decided to
send a letter of complaint to D r .
Harris objecting to .the treatment
of Mr. Dilipkumar and the sending
of a copy of the U n i o n ' s letter
to Roberts Construction.
F o l l o w i n g Roberts' v i s i t a mee-
ting of the College Careers A d v i -
sory Committee on Wednesday de-
cided that the Careers A d v i s o r y
Service would not in future coop-
erate with the U n i o n in sending
interviewees a statement of the
Union's views on any company.
The implementation of Union
p o l i c y on recruitment for jobs in
South A f r i c a is l i k e l y to be d i s -
c u s s e d by the Union Academic
Affairs Committee on February
12th.
Help for Iranian Students
Iranian students, who may be
suffering financial hardship due
torthe current situation in Iran,
have been told that they can c l -
aim emergency payments for s i x
weeks from l o c a l s o c i a l security
offices.
Students should go to the off-
ice of the Department of Health
and S o c i a l Security nearest to
where they are l i v i n g . L o c a l
offices are l i s t e d in the teleph-
one directory.
The Kensington and C h e l s e a
offices, referred to in Mary Atten-
borough's letter to Iranian stud-
ents last week, should only be
contacted by students l i v i n g in
those areas. These are postal
areas W6, W8 and W14 for K e n -
sington and SW5, SW6, SW7 and
SW10 for C h e l s e a .
Tuition Fees
Increases in tuition fees of
about fO per cent are expected
to be announced shortly. A joint
meeting of the External Affairs
and Overseas Students Committ-
ees decided to campaign for Im-
p e r i a l College not to implement
any fee increases and to charge
overseas students at the home
rate .
P r e s e n t fee levels are £545
for home undergraduates and £705
for overseas undergraduates. The
postgraduate fees are £805 and
£925 respectively.
The External Affairs Officer
has estimated that it would cost
the College £432,173 to accept
the Union demand in full.
The Postgraduate Group Com-
mittee also agreed to support the
campaign.
Mountaineering Club Plague
The Union is to pay for a new
plaque to replace the one removed
from the w a l l outside the Union
D i n i n g H a l l .
The plaque commemorates IC
students who died in a mountain-
eering expedition in 1961.
Departmental Representative
N o candidate has been nominat"
ed for the post of Mineral Resour-
ces Engineering Departmental Re-
presentative. The position is v a -
cant following the resignation of
Gary Warren. Papers w i l l remain
up until someone comes forward.
Liberal Club
IC Union Executive has stated
that the comments made by L i b -
eral C l u b about the C o l lege med-
ia by no means reflect the views
of the U n i o n E x e c u t i v e .
The E x e c u t i v e has c a l l e d upon
the L i b e r a l C l u b to apologise for
their actions and expressed a hope
that " n o c l u b w i l l act in a similar
irresponsible manner in the fut-
u r e " .
The comments were made in an
article in the c l u b ' s newsletter
F O R W A R D ! dubbed " S i d e w a y s "
by the E x e c u t i v e , and caused a
stir among members of S T O I C and
IC R A D I O .
Accidents
Bernard Smith, a student repre-
sentative on four College safety
Committees is urging a l l students
to report any accidents occurring
in College.
The T e c h n i c a l and Advisory
Safety Committee investigate
accidents for the purpose of de-
creasing the College accident
rate. It is therefore beneficial to
a l l students that the c i r c u m s t a n -
ces of accidents should be known.
Guilds U G M
A t the last G u i l d s Union Meet-
ing, held on Thursday 25 January,
Bob Hart began to speak on a mo-
tion d i s c u s s i n g the recruitment of
graduates for South A f r i c a by com-
panies at I C . The Chairman ruled
it out of order in view of the dou-
bt expressed by a large number
of U n i o n members that perhaps
G u i l d s should not be debating
such a subject.
It was added that the feeling
of most of the G u i l d s E x e c was
that if any motion involves Guilds
Union Members, it should be d i s -
cussed at a C & G Union meeting,
however, a decision must be taken
before a debate may begin.
K e i t h Rogers was voted G u i l d s
P u b l i c i t y officer. H i s posters
have been praised by many stud-
ents, including his rival in the
election.
G u i l d s revealed a new initia-
tion routine which involved Toma-
to Ketchup. Both K e i t h and Mark
Corrigan had to guess who owned
various pairs of knees, while b l -
indfolded. If they guessed incor-
rectly they were liberally daubed
with Ketchup.
Falmouth Theft
L a s t Saturday, while watching
the 'Two R o n n i e s ' , in Falmouth's
T V lounge, a resident heard what
he believed to be two gunshots.
He rushed out into the gallery
and found that the P o o l table had
been rifled. Not only had £60 in
lOp pieces been stolen but also
most of the table mechanism and
several b a l l s .
The main part of the ball d i s -
tribution equipment was myster-
iously found and returned. P l a y
soon restarted although residents
are s t i l l searching for the black
b a l l .
