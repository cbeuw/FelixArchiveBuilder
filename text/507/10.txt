Barclays
The British U n i v e r s i t i e s Sports Federation
Conference, held at Edinburgh a few weeks
ago, passed a motion rejecting any form of
sponsorship from Barclays Bank for sporting
teams because of its involvement in Southen
em A f r i c a .
The two climbers who scaled N e l s o n ' s
Column in October in protest against B a r -
c l a y s involvement in Southern A f r i c a have
been found not guilty. However, they have
incurred considerable costs in defending
themselves in court. Donations towards
their legal costs should be sent to the A n t i -
Apartheid Movement, 89 Charlotte Street,

"Immigrants are people who come to South
Africa in its hour of need to stand by the
whites here" - former South African Prime
Minister John Vorster.
The following information is provided by
the Anti-Apartheid Movement:
The question of the recruitment of grad-
uates a t British universities by South A f r i -
can and British Companies operating in
South A f r i c a continues to pose a major chal-
lenge to the student movement. One company
alone - Roberts Construction a South African
construction company, - w i l l be holding over
20 interviewing s e s s i o n s at U n i v e r s i t i e s and
c o l l e g e s to recruit graduates to work in
.South A f r i c a , in February this year. ,
In their information sheet for potential
applicants Roberts Construction say "Be-
cause of the nature and scope of its oper-
ation it (Roberts Construction) is a highly
intensive and a large industrial employer of
manpower, with over 42,000 employees. This
demands a moral and social responsibility
towards the community. South Africa is a
multi-racial society and Roberts Construc-
tion has an obligation to endeavour to ful-
fill the aspirations of each racial group."
Worthy sentiments ; but what are the real
facts behind this verbiage in Roberts C o n -
struction's glossy handout ; what is it real -
ly like for Black South African workers and
what role do recruited 'immigrants' play in
supporting the A partheid system?
South A f r i c a ' s black workers are denied
fundamental political rights and are subject
to the most v i c i o u s exploitation which the
apartheid policy seeks to preserve and if
possible extend .The denial of human and
political rights combine with low wages and
repression of trade union organisation into a
system that attempts to make near slaves of
a gigantic workforce and at the same time
maximise profits .
African workers are:
* Excluded from many jobs by law -they are
excluded from s k i l l e d and in many cases,
particularly in the construction industry,
even semi-skilled jobs by legislation, agree-
ments between employers and white trade
unions, by apprenticeships and by racist
custom.
* Forced to carry passes at a l l times. The
system of pass laws controls and regulates
the movement of every African in the white
areas of South A f r i c a , i e . 8 6 . 3 % of the coun -
try. The pass laws have been described a s
the tightest permit control system in the
world - in 1975 alone 387 thousand people
were prosecuted under these l a w s .
* Forced to work a s migratory labourers in
the land of their birth -the implementation
of apartheid entails the ruthless removal from
the c i t i e s and other parts of white South
A f r i c a of all Africans superfluous to the nee-
ds of the white economy . Those remaining
in the c i t i e s and white areas have a b s o l u t e -
ly no political rights and the enormity of
these removals i s on a scale approaching
those perpetrated by N a z i Germany in E u r o -
pe -in 1974 2.5 million Africans had been
removed to the homelands. Migratory labour-
ers work in the white areas on a contract
system, their fami lies must remain in the
homelands for this period, w h i l s t they live
in single sex hostels and they are forced to
return to the homelands for long periods. In
effect the homelands act as reservoirs of
cheap labour and the African people have no
right to choose where they live or work.
* Denied the right to organise themselves -
strikes are effectively i l l e g a l . Workers who
attempt to organise trade unions are black-
listed, sacked, banned, imprisoned and in
the c a s e of 3 leading trade unionists in the
last 2 years detained and tortured to death
by the South African police .
* P a i d poverty wages -despite the claims of
international and South African companies
which claim to act as agents of change,
the majority of the African work force are
paid poverty wages. In the construction
industry in 1976 the average annual wage
tor a white was R7.036 and for an African
R1.380. Unemployment is exceptionally high.
Despite these facts Roberts Construction
and, of course, the many other companies
which recruit s k i l l e d personnel at British
Universities claim that they endeavour to
fulfill the aspirations of each racial group.
The facts contradict these statements and
in fact it has been shown over many years
that these companies are w i l l i n g a l l i e s with
the regime in sustaining a system which g u -
arantees the highest per capita profit ratio
in the world.
Throughout the years the opponents of the
boycott policy -those apologists for aparth-
eid - h a v e argued that it is better to build
bridges with South A f r i c a in order to have
influence over apartheid. Once again the
truth is far removed.
"If this policy is effective why is there
no indication of change. In fact the areas
where some cosmetic changes have taken
place are in the areas where boycott strate -
gy has been effective, ie sport. In addition
to w h i c h , far from moving towards change,
if anything the system of apartheid has be -
come more intensive and is applied with an
ever increasing ruthlessness.,
* External links are links which in a very
direct way support the apartheid system. The
recruitment of s k i l l e d personnel to work in
South A f r i c a means that in the first place
these people join the many others who mi -
grate to South A f r i c a and reinforce the white
power structure. They take with them exper-
tise in many fields including the s k i l l s w h i - '
ch even the South Africa regime itself admits
are necessary for it to build an independence
and self sufficiency in case of international
economic sanctions, such as the arms and
nuclear industry. In addition to which these
" i m m i g r a n t s " no matter how well intention-
ed they may be are quickly absorbed into
the white power structure - it is of course
only "pure whites" who are allowed to go.
B l a c k s or people of mixed race w i l l not be
allowed to go.
Hence the proviso on the Roberts Cons -
truction hand out: "All appointments are
subject to the immigration requirements
being complied with and the necessary pre-
mits obtained.
White immigrants become enmeshed in a l l
the structures of racist rule and are even
forced by law to serve in the South African
army to defend Apartheid.
Whilst over 20% of the active black popu-
lation i s unemployed and thousands more
are being made redundant every day-white
workers are being recruited at British Uni -
versities to work in South A f r i c a and to
work in South A f r i c a and to fill jobs which
black South Africans may not fill by law.
* T h e South African people, the organisa-
tions fighting apartheid and the liberation
movement has called for an economic, c u l -
tural, academic and sports boycott. They
state that they are committed to any policy
which though it may in the short term bring
some minor increased hardships, contribute
to the weakening of the system and a s s i s t
their struggle.
The system of racial exploitation in South
A f r i c a , because in the final a n a l y s i s it means
the good life for whites and big profits for
business, attracts immigrants to South A f r i -
c a like flies to a dunghill!
