ssion that women face, and con-
tinue to relate to women in a way
which women may feel repressive.
Most WiST meetings are open to
everyone to attend (in fact in the
four years it has been going it
has only held two women only
meetings) and the last o c c a s i o n
was for women only at the express
desire of the speaker, who works
for a women only newspaper. How-
ever, at that meeting it was noti-
ceable that the atmosphere was
more relaxed due to the absence
of some of our male friends who
tend to dominate d i s c u s s i o n . (I
know I do too, but at least I'm
aware of it!) The male stereotype
is toward dominance, being in con-
trol (of oneself and of others) and
towards 'getting o n ' i n a career.
The female stereotype i s toward
caring for others (necessary in the
role of wife and mother), submiss-J
iveness and that the chief defini- I
tion of s u c c e s s is through sexual
attractiveness. (A 'career woman'
is always rather p i t i e d in her i n -
ability to succeed as a woman
through marriage.) Women there-
fore tend towards self approba-
tion and a l a c k of aggression. It
is difficult for women to overcome
this and enter into d i s c u s s i o n
(basically they tend to be shyer),
whereas a man may also be shy
but feels more of a need to over-
come it in order to 'prove himself.
Not only may it be difficult for
a man to understand such aspects
of a woman's character but a l s o
he cannot appreciate the effect
of continual reminders to women
of the role they are supposed to
p l a y . If Mr. L u c o c k walks through
the streets at night he does not
expect to be harangued by people
who feel that the only reason he
can be there is due to h i s sexual
a v a i l a b i l i t y , nor i f he goes into a
bar night c a n he expect references
to him as merely a body to be
leered or jeered at (as happens to
women either as a sex, e.g. " s h e
stood on a bridge at midnight",
or as i n d i v i d u a l s , e.g. as in the
latest rather pleasant version of
'Allouetta'). Some women do not
object to the fact that their role
is seen as to be a sex object
(though some like Anne Onimus
of l a s t week's issue feel that they
should be treated with a little mere
'respect') but for women who are
trying to e s t a b l i s h their right to
be an individual and not just an
object such events are both a
denial of one's right to do so
but also an attack on women as
a sex.
Male only events are very often
sexist as they are aimed at re-
emphasising a man's sex role
(having a bit of fun with the lads)
A women only meeting is merely
trying to give back some confid-
ence to women and allow them to
discuss freely in order to over-
come the repressive pressures
placed by society which at pre-
sent is largely in male control.
If Mr. L u c o c k really does so
well understand female repress-
ion then he should also under-
stand our need to get together
in order to overcome our repress-
ion. T h i s does not mean that we
do not appreciate those male
friends prepared to help attack
sexism and to most of our meet-
ings we have welcomed their
attendance.
Yours in sisterhood, '
