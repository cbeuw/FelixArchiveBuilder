WELFARE DAY
an 'obvious success'
The largest audience seen for a long time gathered to watch
STOIC in the Junior Common Room on Wednesday afternoon.
The attraction was the controversial sex education film "Grow-
ing U p " which was being shown as part of the Union's Welfare Day.
The film, originally intended for school children, explained all the
facts about sex illustrated by sequences showing sexual acts.
Welfare A d v i s e r Michael Arthur thought the film was helpful as
it treated the subject in an open manner. But Union Officer Sheyne
Lucock c r i t i c i s e d its bias towards heterosexuality and several peo-
ple said that the film's opening sequence tende'd to reinforce s e x
roles.
Another popular event w a s the
highly publicised condom blowing

team from E l e c t r i c a l Engineering
and Mines, q u i c k l y emerged as
the winner and w a s awarded the
prize of a bottle of w h i s k y . After-
wards Union President Mary A t t -
enborough commented " i t w a s
really s i l l y " , while distributing
free condoms to the audience.
Several organisations gave
short talks to an audience of over
100. " R e l e a s e " explained how
important it was for a l l people to
know their rights as anybody
could e a s i l y be arrested by the
police even if innocent.
The Campaign for Homosexual
Equality suggested that about 40
people in the J C R at that moment
may be gay and explained how the and saying that " T h e r e is no
law discriminated against homo - correct use of sex outside marr- i
s e x u a l s . i a g e " (their emphasis).
