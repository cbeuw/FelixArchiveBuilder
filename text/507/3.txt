C & G
I hope everyone has recovered
from D&D by now, it was a truly
excellent night. Pans People
were a sight for sore eyes, (FW-
worrrr t). Talking of sore eyes,
Mr. Corrigan and his guest caused
a few when they led the first wal-
tz, all on their own. To everyones
disappointment, except Brendan
C l e m e n t s ' , Brendan won the mag-
nificent Teddy Bear, which w a s
the star prize in the raffle. (Hunk
won the booby prize, with h i s s o b
ticket. — A n y one want a cow
moo?) T h e champagne and c o c k -
t a i l s flowed ireely until 4 am, a l l
in ai I everyone had a thoroughly
good time. I hope this w i l l be a
lesson to you suckers that didn't
go, may you forever remain a l e -
mon .
