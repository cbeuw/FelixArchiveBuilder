&m£i£e : Dr. Weale
Kenneth Edward Weale spent hts undergraduate
days a t Aberyswyth, where he obtained a f i r s t i n
Chemistry, and, a f t e r a b r i e f excursion into
industry, came t o I.C. as research student i n 1946.
His cunning and methodical brain caused him to plan
his research programme with great care. He spent
just over two years doing experimental work, then
he performed superfluous confirmatory experimental
work u n t i l the summer, so that he could combine
w r i t i n g h i s thesis with spending every day a t
Lord's or F.'arlington.
He i s one of the few members of s t a f f who take
an active interest i n Union a f f a i r s . He i s the Hon.
Treasurer of I.C. Union as w e l l as President of the
Cricket Club and a Vice-President of the Rugby foot-
b a l l Club, Students w i l l be relieved t o hear that
t h e i r Treasurer i s very t h r i f t y : - even Mrs. Robin-
son claims that i t took her f i v e years to cadge a
sherry from him.
In h i s student days Ken gained a purple i n both
boxing and rugger. He has twice been with I.C.
Rugger ciub to Delft, some of whose students believe
hi a to be the hero of the fanous o l d English rugger
song "Round and round went the b l y great Wheel."
He s i t s on the Middlesex Rugby Committee.
Perhaps Weale has achieved most notoriety i n
his a c t i v i t i e s as a cricketer, i n which capacity he
modestly styles himself "The Great Doctor." He bats
with a rare and graceful a r t i s t r y , h i s most impressive]
stroke, which he frequently brings into play, i s a
firm forward push wide of mid-on, which sends the
b a l l over the slips'heads f o r two. His innings
have varied from b r i l l i a n t to dismal: on one
singular accasion he struck 67 not out (including
six sixes) i n 29 minutes. In another innings he
spent over twenty minutes i n scoring nought. His
bowling prowess i s rather an unknown quantity:
last year the only occasion on which he was put on
to bowl was i n a Sunday match, when he himself,was
captain.
His alertness of mind, so essential t o a c r i c k -
eter was demonstrated when he narrowly averted a
road accident by changing the car he was driving
straight from fourth gear into reverse.
His l i k e s are Devonshire cream, which he
has-
been known t o consume at1
4lb. at a time, and
cats. He i s evasive about h i s d i s l i k e s , hut claims
that h i s most i n f u r i a t i n g experience was when
given out lbw by W.P. Goss at Cambridge.
His q u a l i f i c a t i o n s as sub-warden of the Hostel
are legion. His d i g n i f i e d and burly appearance once
caused him t o be mistaken f o r the house detective
i n a large Torquay hotel. I t i s rumoured that i n
the days of h i s early youth he attempted, w h i l s t *
l i v i n g i n a hostel, to s a i l across a pond i n the
grounds i n a wardrobe drawer. He has been known
to r e f e r t o the Hostel as a "Palace of Sport."
One way and another Weale gets through a
vast amount of work. One could only wish that more
members of s t a f f were prepared to devote so much
time and energy t o the e x t r a - c a r r i c u l a r a c t i v i t i e s
of college l i f e as he i s .

Dear S i r ,
Whilst browsing through the back numbers
of the M i n i s t r y of Education reports, student
funds; the l e g a l aspect of; I was struck by ths
lack of f o r s i g h t and imagination shown i n the
M i n i s t r y . The reports deal with l o t t e r i e s , pools
plans (and t h i s i n c i d e n t l y , makes most i n t e r e s t i n g
reading. There was one case where the P r i n c i p a l of
a famous university won £75000, and promptly
absconded with the funds - but that i s digressing),
c h a r i t y 'Rags', sporting and c u l t u r a l entertainment
(a sort of open day so that the man i n the street
can see how h i s money i s being spent). Now and
then a large "help the poor desitute student" camp-
ain i s organised - but t h i s generally f a i l s i n i t s
aim, f o r i t seems that the only person who wants
to help a poor desitute student i s another poor
destitute student.
As I have already said, there exists a
considerable lack of forsight among the people
whose duty l i e s i n r a i s i n g money f o r students.
I am a n a t u r a l l y lazy man, and as such, I n a t u r a l l y
look f o r less energetic - and more c e r t a i n - ways
of r a i s i n g the necessary finances. "Why," I ask
myself "why cannot the e x i s t i n g s i t e s of buildings
be used to advantage? The ins ides are used - why
not use the outsides?" And following t h i s t r a i n
of thought, I stumbled upon the answer which has
been found everywhere but here. Advertisments are
legion - look at P i c a d i l l y Circus, where, every
available v e r t i c a l (and sometimes horizontal) area
has been used to advertise. Why cannot some of our
college buildings be treated i n the same way?
We've never thought of i t - that i s the answer.
AESTHETIC YET UTILITARIAN - NEW-LOOK FOR THE HUXLEX.
And the aesthetic need not be s a c r i f i c e d
for the u t i l i t a r i a n . No, indeed, the c u l t u r a l
value of the buildings can be enhanced by discrim-
inate advertising. Take the Beit Building, f o r
instance. A large, f u l l lengh poster f o r "Luxury-
foam" mattresses at 1st f l o o r l e v e l , ladies
garments to the west, gentlemen's underwear to
the east, and crowning a l l , a " P e r s i l washes whiter"
in neon l i g h t s . Put a "Drink more milk, and keep
f i t " on the new Aeronautical and Chemical Engineer-
ing Building - and the students keep f i t while
Mr. Mooney s e l l s more m i l k , makes more p r o f i t ,
and lowers the price of meals even more. I t
works from every angle, as the Americans say.
Yours, etc.
Albert L e n t i l .
