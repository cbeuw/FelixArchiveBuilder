IMPERIAL INSTITUTE TO GO
N V S N E W S
At a General Meeting l a s t Tuesday, the Royal
School of Mines' Union passed a motion refusing
to be associated with the National Union of
Students.
This followed one of the most serious d i s -
cussions that has taken place at an R.S.M. Union
M e t i n g . Even the Hon. Pornographer had nothing
to show while t h i s motion was under discussion.
It was f i n a l l y passed by 83 votes to 7, with
8 abstentions.
Having expressed t h e i r f e e l i n g about the
Matter, the R.S.M. w i l l presumeable remain quite
independent of any decision that I.C. Union makes
mt i t s next meeting.
N.U.S. HOSTEL APPEAL
The N.U.S. are having a house to house
c o l l e c t i o n to raise £30,000 f o r a student hostel
In London. This w i l l be i n the week preceding t h e i r
f l a g day on 25th February.
THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE HAS BEEN RECEIVED.
Early on Monday evening, a body of Guildsmen
together with s i x men from the R.C.S., decided to
v i s i t Kings, i n order to paint Reggie i n the
•ppropiate colours. Scouts had already been sent
to reconnoitre and at 7.30p.m., 16 s u i t a b l y equipped
Students, with Brian Oggi i n the lead, i n f i l t r a t e d
by means of peaceful penetration into the precincts
of Kings'. In the main h a l l , one or two, with the
g i f t of the 'gab', engaged the porters and anyone
•Ise who happened to pass by, with l i v e l y conver-
sation.
Meanwhile, i n the front of t h e i r very noses,
Reggie was given his coat of many colours by Our
two p a i n t e r s , the a r t i s t i c character of t h e i r
attentions not being r e a l i s e d u n t i l i t was too
l a t e . The participants then made good t h e i r escape
while the might of Kings was s t i l l too stunned to
•Ike a move. Brian Oggi again played a distinguished
part i n the r e t r e a t .

FUTURE SITE UNDECIDED
The b u i l d i n g designed by Thomas Collcut
to commemorate Queen V i c t o r i a ' s Jubilee i n 1887
w i l l have to be removed to raakeway for the
expanding Imperial College.
This i s the i m p l i c a t i o n of the answer to
the recent questions i n the House of Lords by
the Chairman of the Governing Body, Lord Falmouth.
The Government do not intend to l e t anything
stand i n the way of increasing the number of
technical students.
The l o c a t i o n of the new Imperial Institute
has not yet been decided, and i t s date of removal
has yet to be l e g i s l a t e d . The press have already
commented about the delay i n the expansion
programme, and t h i s has given people a chance
to ask f o r i t s preservation.
The Kensington Society, which treasures
buildings l i k e the Imperial Institute oppose
t h i s removal, although i t s secretary confesses
to not having been inside the b u i l d i n g . The
Campden H i l l group have not paid s u f f i c i e n t
attention to Mr. Pevsner, who i n the recent
Reith Lectures pointed out that the ornament
of buildings was purely sudsidary to i t s
function. I f they went behind t h i s facade
that faces the Royal College of Science they
would r e a l i s e that the f i r e hazard i n the
draughty wooden c o r r i d o r s , and the galvanised
t i n roof makes a mockery of the wedding cake
frontage.
