EgnHSTOM AMD THE 8.CfC.
D. M. Wells
In ths Autumn Number of Phoenix and the last two
issues of Felix there hare appeared comments on some of the
problems confronting the Social Clubs Committee, both at
the present time and when the expansion scheme i s ocmplete.
The most notable thing about these comments i s that while
much space is devoted to the pros and cons of schemes for
decentralisation, very l i t t l e i s said about the problems
themselves. The writers of the previous artloles are no
doubt well aware of the problems involved, but in my view
we must know exaotly what has to be solved before any off
the discussion about possible solutions can become! profit-
able.
As I see i t , the S.C.C.'s difficulties may be classi-
fied under three main headings: 1) Finance, 2) Represen-
tation, 3) Administration, and i t i s by their effect on
these that any sohemes for reorganisation or limitation of
membership must ba judged. Muoh lias already been argued
about the intrinsic merits of small specialised or sec-
tarian clubs as opposed to larger ones catering for many
points of view, and I do not intend to add any more to
this discussion. I must, however, say that in my opinion
i t should be a basio prinoiple that any group of people
with a oommon interest is entitled to form itself into an
official I.C. club, provided that the problems outlined
below can be overcome. In other words, there should be
no question of preventing the formation of clubs as a
matter of prinoiple.
The financial problem is certainly the most acute ana.
Money for the various clubs i3 granted in bulk to the
S.C.C. by Union Counoil and i t is the unenviable task of
the S.C.C. executive to divide this amount fairly between
the clubs, according to their estimated needs. It is a l -
ready necessary for some of the clubs' own estimates to be
reduced to prevent dejui>nd «

g available supply, and
one of the arguments against the formation of new clubs is
that they can be financed only at the expense of existing
ones. Ho doubt more money will be available as the Onion,
increases in size, but the needs of existing clubs may
also be expected to increase, and i f the increase in num-
bers leads to the need for several new clubs the position
will grow steadily worse.
If the reasonable assumption is made that the money
for social activities is never likely to be unlimited, any
' solution to the problem of finance would seem to require
the introduction of a system by whioh the money allocated
to each olub could be impartially assessed in relation to
its contribution to College life. A possible alternative
would be the creation of certain olubs prepared to have
all the advantages of official recognition save that of
support from Union funds. Unfortunately, the first of
these alternatives demands a person or committee with Sol-
omen-like qualities, and the second presupposes a rather
radical change in human nature. However, I think i t i s
along these lines that a solution will have to be sought.
The size of the*.CO., and its composition, present
the second main problem. The efficiency of any committee
tends to fall off in proportion to its size, and i t i s
difficult to reoonoile this with the need for representation
of all interests. This will of oourse become worse as
each new club is formed. There i s also the potential
danger that i f a large number of small clubs were repre-
sented the voting of the committee might on occasion not
represent the opinion of the majority of club members.
These problems seem to call for some form of reorganisation,
but whatever form this takes i t i s unlikely to please every-
body.
Finally, there i s the problem of administration. This
is really an aspect of the size problem, for the1
large num-
bers greatly increase the normal executive work of a com-
mittee. Arising from this is the danger that, with the
best of intentions and through sheer necessity, work whioh
should be done by the whole committee has to be left to the
executive. This may create the feeling that the oommittee
is controlled by its executive and that i t is itself there
only to advise and not to make decisions.
I have tried to outline the main problems of the S.C.C.
(whioh are probably shared to some extent by other Union
organisations) as I see them, and I do not pretend to know
any of the answers to them, i f indeed satisfactory ones
exist. I hope no one will accuse me of casting reflections
on the work of the S.C.C. or of any of its officers or m
e
m
-
bers, because that i s net my intention, nor have I any axs
to grind. These comments will have achieved their purpose
i f they stimulate members of the Union to thought and dis-
cussion about a problem whioh closely concerns them and
their successors.
LETTERS TO T H E E D I T O R
NIL DESPERANDOM
Dear S i r ,
28th. Jan. 19S6
Tour leader i n the l a s t Fekix suggests that
you believe an i n t e r e s t i n c u l t u r e to be waning
at I.C. This i s not borne out by Onion L i b r a r y
s t a t i s t c s .
Based on the rather scanty figures a v a i l a b l e ,
during the period 1930-39 about 6.5 % of the student
population ware members of the Union L i b r a r y , During
1945-54, the corresponding average f i g u r e i s almost
18* and i s slowly r i s i n g .
I know that there are other f a c t o r s than an
interest i n culture to account f o r t h i s almost three
f o l d increase i n reading. However, although the
Library Committee deplores the f a c t , that only one
student i n f i v e takes the trouble to borrow books
from us, there i s every i n d i c a t i o n that present
day students are more i n t e r e s t e d i n general reading
than were t h e i r predecessors of almost a generation
ago.
Take hope. S i r . Remember, there was not even
a " F e l i x " s i x ( ? ) years ago.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Peter Rowe
Chairman, Union Library Committee
PRAISE FOR NELSON
Dear S i r ,
R.S.M. Bessemer Lab.
I would l i k e to congratulate you f o r having
published i n " F e l i x " Nelson's "Guide to the Womenrts
Colleges". However, though t h i s guide has been
sadly needed f o r a long time.I fear that i t i s i n -
complete and i n one instance even wrong.
There are c e r t a i n l y more than fourteen women's
colleges i n London w i t h i n f a i r l y easy reach of I.C.
and I hope that i n the near future a complete
guide can be drawn up g i v i n g more information. For
instance, how many people know where the Froebel
Education I n s t i t u t i o n i s ? Also t h i s guide could
be widened to take i n Nurse's Homes and give warning-
to which to avoid.
Yours Etc.

REDUNDANT U.L.U. CARDS?
Dear S i r ,
R.C.S. Union Lounge
February 5th. 1956
Much has r e c e n t l y been said of the uselessness
of the U.L. union cards issued l a s t term. I contend
that these cards w i l l i n time prove t h e i r worth
and should therefore be kept. I used my card
recentlyy not f o r i t s primary purpose but to gain
admission to the union premises of another u n i -
v e r s i t y . No doupt I s h a l l be able to f i n d f u r t h e r
uses f o r my card; such as obtaining cheap student
rates f o r entrance to shows of e x h i b i t i o n s . On
the other hand my College Union Card has been
c a r e f u l l y preserved along with my National Service
Registration Card and has only seen the l i g h t of
day when the Year Rep. l a feWeed to sign i t .
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Card F i d d l e r
