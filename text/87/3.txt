On the f i r s t page, i t i s mentioned that
the National Union of Students ars annealing
for funds f o r a Hostel to rvpiaes the one
they must vacate t h i s summer. This w i l l o f f e r
improved f a c i l i t i e s f o r foriegn and p r o v i n c i a l
-tudents i n t r a n s i t through London or v i s i t i n g
for a few days.
A proposal was made at the l a s t I.C.
General Meeting that the Union should r e j o i n
the N.U.S.. and since the President s a i d such
a motion needed notice, i t has been formally
submitted f o r consideration at the next Union
Meeting,
Imperial College has been a member of the
N.U.S., but l e f t f o r various p o l i t i c a l reasons,
The Union o f f i c e r s have always f e l t i t t h e i r ,
duty to provide f o r the s o c i a l and a t h l e t i c
a c t i v i t i e s i n the College, and to avoid assoc-
i a t i o n with anything bearing a p o l i t i c a l tag.
Thus we l e f t N.U.S. a f t e r a very short member-
ship i n T939 when i t suggested that a l l students
should have exemption from m i l i t a r y s e r v i c e , and
thejr should register as p a c i f i s t s to achieve
t h i s end.
Imperial College joined again a f t e r the war,
though the Royal School of Mines refused to be
associated with t h i s act of the ipa'rent; union.
Following the red scare years a f t e r the B e r l i n
a i r l i f t , the College l e f t again because of the
p o l i t i c s of the N.U.S., who had sent i t s o f f i c e r s
to Moscow. The Royal College of Science remained
a member f o r a further two years.
The cost to the College at present to be a
member of N.U.S. would be one s h i l l i n g per head,
though t h i s w i l l increase to l/3d. next year.
Individual students may be members f o r 10/- per
year.
The advantage of being i n N.U.S. must be
considered to see what value we get f o r t h i s
sua.
It gives the College societies a chance to
take part i n various contests and f e s t i v a l s :
debating, drama and folk-dancing are the chief
current a c t i v i t i e s .
Individuals can get cheap t r a v e l f a c i l i t i e s
through chartered a i r c r a f t , though these are
available outside the N.U.S., and holiday tours
are also organised by other t r a v e l bureaus, A
labour exchange i s provided f o r vacation work,
though since many Imperial College students
must have t e c h n i c a l t r a i n i n g , t h i s i s not so
useful. One must pay extra f o r t h i s service
of the N.U.S. and i t s organisation appears to
be too bureaucratic;, but no doubt i t provides a
service f o r those l a c k i n g i n i t i a t i v e .
What i s probably the most important advant- .
age i s that i t gives students recognised represent-
atives. At present the N.U.S. claim to represent
75* of the students of t h i s country. With a 100%
support they could command more respect. They
have been recognised by the government to the
extent of serving on various M i n i s t r y of Educ-
ation committees. Although t h i s might be decreed
as a p o l i t i c a l a c t i v i t y , i t gives students, or
at least t h e i r representatives a chance to
express t h e i r views.
The present President of N.U.S. i s a Conser-
vative. Hence the close liason with the Government
and the support f o r a f f i l i a t i o n by the Conserv-
atives i n the College. Other members of N.U.S.
and possibly future Presidents have opposing
p o l i t i c s , and hence the S o c i a l i s t s i n the College
support a f f i l i a t i o n . Both sides seem confident
that theirs w i l l dictate policy.
Whether I.C. Union joins and i s associated
with one side or the other, or whether i t
preserves i t s p o l i t i c a l independence w i l l be
decided at the next General Meeting.

SAYING OF THE WEEK. " I w i l l look at any a d d i t i o n a l
evidence to confirm the opinion to which I have
already come"- Mr. Hugh Molson, Parliamentary
Secretary, M i n i s t r y of Transport.
THE WOMENS' COLLEGES: I am quite aware that there
are a number of errors i n my guide i n the l a s t
e d i t i o n and while apologising, would nevertheless
l i k e to remind my c r i t i c s of the d i f f i c u l t i e s
inherent i n such a survey. For example, I f e a r
that there i s one error due to the fact that the
f i l l y who gave me the information on one college
was t r y i n g to dispose of my attentions at the
time. As G do not think there are any errors due
to a converse trend i n my a f f a i r s (no place
stated as staying open a l l n i g h t ) , I am thankful
to "Hop Happy" f o r reminding me about the Nurses'
Homes (the Editor t e l l s me you don't need to go
further than one Nurses' Home and he seems to
know). But returning to the errors, a number of
people have wrongly contradicted me.begause the
regulations had changed since they l a s t knew
the place; regulations change quite frequently
(when they are tightened up, there i s usually
a good story somewhere).
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT. Reviewing the f i l m "0
Dreamland", John Gale writes i n the Observer:
"On entering Dreamland, the amusement park,
you are f i r s t i n v i t e d to see a model of the
e l e c t r i c c h a i r which dealt with the Rosenbergs,
the atom spies; then "Torture through the Ages"-
"You must see torture by burning o i l " implores
an unctuous voice, "your children w i l l love i t " .
The grotesque dummy of a policeman laughs madly

Typewriters?
Christopher Sholes was the
first man to produce a really
workable typewriter. In 1873 he
contracted the firm of E- Rem*
ington and Sons for its manu-
facture , and now the name is a
household word. We buy, eVeJI

ingtons, but also many other
makes. We have speciali terms
