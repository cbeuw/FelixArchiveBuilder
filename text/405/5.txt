FELIX
CROSS C O U N T R Y
A PINNACLE to which we had
long aspired was convincingly
conquered last Saturday when the
l( lst team won the University of
London Championships for the
first time since 1968. This success
was centred on the performances
of the tireless trio: Rob Allinson,
who won the race in 28.04 —'a
fair run' — and with it the Charles
Moor Memorial Trophy; Steve
Webb, in 3rd place, reaching fit-
ness with the aid of his advanced
technology racing spikes; and
Ian Ellis, that well-known slacker,
in 5th place. Sterling support
came from the remaining first
learners, Paul Clarke (13th),
Alf Garnett (15th), and Dave Jones
(21st). For their very creditable
efforts, the aforementioned
deserve much praise in rounding
off the term's running most
satisfactorily.
Let us not forget the IC 2nd
team. The focal point of pre-race
attention and nerves, Tony Weir,
having finally decided upon the
optimal mode of footwear, led us
in, in 24th, followed by the Spray
Kid in 29th. A long gap was then
filled in by a big rush oflPete
Mike, Colin and Martin. Last, and
least, one should forget Andy
Davey, at present undergoing a
bad attack of that recurring annual
disease, 'handicaposis', where
the victim suffers from a period
of exceptionally slow running
prior to the handicap, in order to
gain an advantageous time.
Surprisingly, he managed to find
his way home, in 47th place, still
managing to beat the entire L S E
2nd team, who filled 5 of the
final 6 positions. After the race,
a timekeeper's inquiry decided
that all times were subject to a
rather mysterious experimental
error of — 1 minute.
Last Wednesday, 3/12, we ran
in the Osterley Park Relay.

in freezing fog, he still had
sufficient stamina to run 4 days
later whereas other mere mortals,
would require crutches to advance
themselves in any given direction.
On the 3rd lap, audacious Steve
Webb passed no less an athlete
than potential Olympic champion,
Alan Pascoe who was running for
a team of Borough Road lecturers.
At the time, the latter was finding
trouble arranging a stride pattern
which would avoid mud — Steve
disregarded finesse, and used
about as much delicacy as a
Sherman tank in passing the said
Mr Pascoe. Rob Allinson, kindly
lent to us for all the afternoon by
the Maths Dept., gained 5 places
in pushing the 1st team up to 17th
place.
Thanks to another of those
selectorial c.u.'s by Ian Ellis,
the third team beat the second by
a whole minute. Nigel Miller,
taking a break from the hustle
and bustle of rucks and scrums,
found the going unsuitable, and
a fine run by the Catering Manager
(alias Paul Clarke) enabled the
third team to register one of its
few victories over the 2nd team.
For the first team, particular
mention ganes to Dave Rosen:
having recorded a meritous time
of 2hrs 52mins in the Barnsley
marathon the previous Sunday, run
