It has been a long arduous term for many people and many
events of significance and insignificance have taken place.
The most recent of these was the N U S annual conference held
in Scarborough.
The conference which tended to be dominated by petty
p o l i t i c a l squabbling and bitching produced a mixture of p o l i c i e s
which on the whole are good common sense p o l i c i e s .
On the other hand it also produced no policy whatsoever as
regards the issue of democracy within N U S . Yet this was the
issue that should have been the highlight of the conference
and that many people at conference wished to see something
being done about. That i s , people wanted to see N U S have a
policy, the nature of the policy differing from each p o l i t i c a l
grouping to the next.
T h i s was not to be. A combination of p o l i t i c a l manoeuvring,
l i e s and bad chairing contrived to ensure a fruitless result to a
debate sadly l a c k i n g in common sense and finese.
It does National U n i o n ' s image no good when one of i t s
leadership stands up at a national conference and t e l l s lies
and i s then backed-up by the President. It is not only gross
irresponsibility, it i s a betrayal of the membership they claim
to represent and shows utter contempt for conference, a body
which these same self people proclaim i s the sovereign body
of the N a t i o n a l U n i o n .
I should like to apologise to S C A B for the cock-up that
occurred in last weeks issue and thus ruined the presentation
of what was a good feature. My apologies a l s o to the countless
others whose articles have not always been put in in the
correct order — w e ' l l try harder next term.
I should also like to thank the staff for their hard work this
term, and a l s o R o b i n Gray who d i d a lot of our typing for this
week.
L a s t l y , Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you a l l !

WARNING
The National Westminster Bank, local Police and
Security Officers at Imperial College are becoming
increasingly concerned at the number of thefts of
cheque books, cheque cards and credit cards taking
place on the College Premises. In the main thefts
occur from jackets left unattended in offices and
lecture rooms.
We ask all customers to ensure that all such items
are kept quite separately on their persons and that
every precaution is taken to safeguard them at all
times.
RCC Transport
The following important changes
have or are about to take place:-
1. From 1st D e c . 1975 the fee for
the R C C driving test w i l l be 75p.
The increase of 25p w i l l go to the
tester.
The driver's security remains
at £5.
2. T h e non-priority minibus w i l l
become the priority vehicle for
A C C for an experimental period —
throughout the Spring Term —
starting J a n 5th 1976.
T h i s means that a l l five R C C
vehicles are priority vehicles for
certain clubs during this period.
3. It appears that from l s t January
1976, new qualifying drivers w i l l
have to be over 21 years of age
before they can drive large pass-
enger vehicles (9 or more seats).
Drivers already holding a full
driving licence before 1st January
1976 may continue to drive such
v e h i c l e s . Your attention is drewn
to leaflet D.100 issued by the
Department of the Environment.
Anyone s t i l l wishing to book R C C
vehicles during the Xmas vacation
should contact Mike Wright (int.
4125) immediately.

My Xmas offering must have the
highest nause rating ever. I do
not apologise for it — I just c l a i m
diminished responsibility.
And now
An Executive Christmas Carol
Once upon a time, there was a
merry o l d soul called Burt Teague
He was a cheery little chap and
every year he went on holiday to
his favourite holiday camp,
situated on the South Downs. He
always enjoyed himself — he
played golf, football, snooker
and ping pong.
One summer whilst he was on
just such a holiday, he decided
to go fishing, s o off he s e t . He
went to the little village of
Timbray, which is an old and un-
spoilt little place, in Kent. Burt
had fun. He had a go at winkle
picking, but he was not very good
at it. A s a local put it, ' E e dont
pick'ard enough!
Burt also entered the local
fishing competition, in which he
came second, netting a 121b
white Roe. In fact, he was s o
good, the winner had to cheet'ham
(ugh!). Having worked-up a good
thirst Burt toddled off to the bar
and ordered a martini, 'Shake' it
but don't stir', he ordered as he
cogitated over the competition.
Burt was not a bright man, but
he knew he'd been fiddled, He was
adamant that he should get h i s own
back; 'Once botten, twice shy may
alright for some', mused Burt
'but can I let him get away with it?
God, freyed not — his head needs
s'limming down to fit h i s hat!'
But Burt had to leave the camp
the next day, s o he took the guy
on one side and whispered, 'Hoy
lets have a rematch, huh, next
year, heare at Tray?' 'Sure' came
the reply.
The it would be different

Having got that rubbish out of
my system, may I only say —
Happy New Year and a Merry

The end of the first term approaches
all too q u i c k l y for some while the
the term has crawled for others,
so much so, that the remaining few
hours seems a lifetime.
The mummies and daddies have
come to collect their hard drinking
(I mean) working Johnny from
College. Mummy holds him tight,
proud of the high academic level
that her ' c h i l d ' has reached. After
all what academic level could be
higher than to get drunk every
night for eleven consecutive weeks
(helping to boost the bar profits!);
or sitting nude in the Lower Lounge,
and think of the hours spent gazing
at those knickers in the B a r , not to
mention the highest honour achieved
by the few of streaking round the
Albert H a l l (I wonder if, 'We wotrld
have been amused by that?')
However, I have it from a prominent
member of the College that, it a l l
helps to develop the a b i l i t i e s of
the 'future' leaders of the country.
Oh! Sorry I almost forgot the
ladies of IC some of whom have
probably tried in vain to create an
impression on the traditions of IC.
Having learnt of the self preserv-
ing instinct of the IC male, most
of them in a l l probability have had
to make-a speedy withdraw I to
their rooms and restrict themselves
to talking to a few friends who do
not always regard them as possess-
ed by voyeurism.
Y e s my friends, the end is nigh!
You have to leave this superlative
world of fantacy which the T o l k i e n ,
Peak or Sartre for that matter,
begin to imagine, let alone contem-
plate surpassing.
Do not give up hope my fellow
collegians; a l l is not lost! Just
imagine yourselves on the 5th
January with the grant check in
your pocket and with renewed desire
to perpetuate this unique kingdom of
a thousand and one weird and
wonderful events. A kingdom in
which A l i c e w i l l not only be truly
lost, but that her wonder w i l l be s o
great that she would not be ' a l l o w -
ed' to say ' B u t I don't understand
Queen of Hearts'.
Happy Christmas to you a l l and
have a ' c o s m i c ' New Year.
See you a l l next term.
