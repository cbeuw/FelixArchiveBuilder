At the end of last s e s s i o n
Dave Rumsey, S C A B Chairman
74—75 recommended the
implementation of an " E v e n t s
Book ( S C A B D i a r y ) " . The
reasons for this were two-
fold:
1. On more than one
occasion last year events of
a like or similar nature
clashed and those concerned
were often poorly attended,
or at best they d i d not live
up to expectations. We hope
that this book w i l l keep
these c l a s h e s to a minimum.
2. T h e book w i l l also
be a source of information and
advertising. P a u l Ekpenyong,
Editor of F E L I X , has agreed
to consult the book when
compiling h i s " W h a t ' s O n "
service.
So, if you are organising
an event that w i l l attract a
large crowd or audience,
please help yourselves, help
S C A B and help entertainment
at IC in general by using the
" E v e n t s B o o k " and tell
everyone the " W h o , what,
where, when, how m u c h " of
your event. Just ask J e n in
the Union Office for the book.
Further, if you just want to
know what's o n , consult the
book... There's no charge
for looking.
Thanks,
A L A N R J O N E S
