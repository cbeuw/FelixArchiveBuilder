At htbHt
Alastair Stewart lies over
Electoral Reform
Society's letter
' D E M O C R A T I S E N U S T O D A Y ' ,
that was the message scrawled
on Scarborough beach outside the
Spa, where the N U S was holding
its annual conference last Sunday
The message referred to the
democratisation motion which was
the subject of much heated debate.
(There were in a l l eight amend-
ments to the main motion, of which
the first four were 'delete a l l and
insert' amendments).
It w a s during the debate on the
first amendment to the main motion,
supported by the IC delegation,
that Alastair Stewart, N U S Deputy
President revealed that they (NUS
Exec) had written to the Electoral
Reform Society and received a
reply on the question of direct
elections.
In a passionate and bitter
attack on the F C S / S R P a l l i a n c e
supporting the amendment, he
said,'We (the Exec) believe that
the issue of democracy is some-
thing that has to be raised on
the floor of this conference;
and that is why we wrote to the
Electoral Reform Society and
asked them the very questions
you yourselves are asking — and
their response was the proposit-
ions being put forward in this
amendment and embodied in the
substantive were unworkable,
undemocratic, and quite u n -
principled'.'What that gentleman
up there has just said is a pack
of l i e s ' , was the immediate reply
of Derrick Everett, ICU E A U ,
when he stood-up to speak in
favour of the amendment. Despite
this however, Charles C l a r k e ,
NUS President, supported the
position taken by Mr Stewart
when he showed conference the
offending letter.
Mr Everett has since been
shown to be right in his allegat-
ion. The letter, circulated by the
Federation of Conservative
Students (FCS), Students for
Representative P o l i c i e s (SRP)
and Union of Liberal Students
(ULS) to their members and the
press makes no specific
recommendations one way or the
other on the matter.
On the question of direct
elections it s a y s , ' national
voting by individuals based on
accurate local or national
registration must of necessity —
even if desired — be sometime
away from us — its introduction
would involve re-thinking the
role of Conference and t h e '
relationships between NUS and
constituent organizations'.
The letter goes on to say 'That
there is a strong case for not
leaving things exactly a s they are
where a l l power is exercised by
delegates who have 'emerged, by
processes which have not taken
sufficient methodical account of
the individual opinions of
members'.
The F C S , S R P and U L S in a
joint statement expressed 'whole-
hearted disgust at the p o l i t i c a l
bankruptcy of a union leadership
that finds it necessary to grossly
misrepresent to conference the
evidence of the Electoral Reform
Society on the electoral
structure of N U S '
At the Union C o u n c i l meeting
held last Monday, a motion
requesting the President to write
to Charles C l a r k e regarding the
entire debate on the democratis-
ation motion,was unanimously
carried. The letter, has already
been sent to Mr C l a r k e but a
reply is not expected until some-
time next week.
Red Sue booted
out !
SUE S L I P M A N , N U S National
Secretary, suffered a severe
political defeat over the Internat-
ional section of the Executive
Report
Delegates, annoyed at her
passive acceptance of the
prescence of C S V U , the C z e c h
Students Union, at November's
C h i l e Seminar at U L U , censured
her acceptance and removed her
as convenor of the U n i o n ' s
important International P o l i c y
Group.
The move comes in the wake of
Ms. Slipman's recent appointment
to the (UK) National Executive
of the Communist Party. Her
removal, brought about an unholy
alliance of right wing, moderate
and extreme left wing groups, is
seen as a serious setback to her
chances of succeeding Charles
Clarke as NUS President in 1977.
Chairing, A l i s t a i r Stewart, tried
in vain to transfer the removal and
cunsure solely to the India section
of the report. Bitter c r i t i c i s m
accompanied the s u c c e s s f u l
challenge to h i s ruling.
Ms. Slipman was not the only
member of the communist based
Broad Left to be censured by
conference. On Monday C h a r l e s
Clarke suffered the same fate over
police investigations into the
finances of North London Poly-
technic Students U n i o n . Its
presidentGeoff Rosenberg, moving
the censure, attacked Mr C l a r k e ' s
failure to condemn the police
action.
