Sidcup V 13
T H E D A Y S T A R T E D with a
few last minute panics. A s
usual, the major one being
the late arrival of the coach
- and finally, with fifteen
men and a referee, we
departed. Sidcup arrived
more or less on time, but
with fourteen men only. A
hasty conference in the
A ' s changing room ensued
and then it w a s decided to
grant the plea of the F i r s t s
for a player to make up their
team s o that they could
face fifteen men while we
matched the Sidcup fourteen.
The game was schedule to
start at 2.30pm and to
everyone's amazement it d i d .
Both sides settled down
quickly and soon the c o l l e c t i v e
heart of the A ' s missed a
beat when a sidcup man
tried to drop a goal from the
half-way line, and almost
succeeded. T h e A ' s soon put
a stop to this unsporting
activity but not before that
same Sidcup player had
scored from a penalty,
Cutting the A ' s undeservedly
ehind. We were quickly
back in the attack and
unlucky not to score. John
Fishburn broke through on
the left and gave a w e l l -
timed pass to Mike Siomiak
who was brought down about
ten yards out. T h e A ' s d i d
not have to wiat long for
some reward. Rod Porter,
playing h i s heart out, got
the ball on their twenty-five
and beat three players to
score an excellent try. D i c k
Pullen made the conversion
look easy. That left the
A ' s 6—3 up at half time.
The second half was much
more hectic. Unfortunately,
lax marking at a line-out
let Sidcup in for a soft try.
The A ' s went straight back
at them but no moves reached
fruition, and in fact there
was another mistake which
resulted in another try
by Sidcup. T h e A ' s did not
give up. T h e forwards came
into their own, led by John
Fishburn and R o d Porter. In
the last ten minutes the
A ' s , playing some good
rugby, came very close to
scoring but not close enough.
Chris Becque and Rich
Jenner were both stopped
right on the line. John D a y ,
a last-minute addition to the
team, played w e l l , although
out of position. B u t Sidcup
held on, and won 1 3 - 6 .
That completes the pre-
Chrlstmas matches and
leaves us with a reasonable
record, having won five
and lost three. Our first
game 'next term i s on 10th
January, assuming • that
everyone has recovered
from the festivities.
A Happy Christmas to
all our F E L I X supporters.

ON W E D N E S D A Y , the 3rd
of December IC 1st XI
travelled to the picturesque
L S E ground. Although
hampered by injuries to four
key players, IC started w e l l ,
and the brisk open football
made a mockery of the poor
pitch. However, L S E managed
to score first, following a
fine move down the left. The
game degenerated into a
scrappy affair, with both
teams finding it difficult
to keep their feet on a pitch
that w a s now cutting up
considerably, and the score
remained the same till
half time.
In the second half IC
attacked w e l l , and achieved
a penalty after an L S E
defender had handled the
b a l l . The job w a s given to
Terry Lindon, who calmly
slotted the ball home, the
'keeper making every effort
to dive out of the way. T h i s
lifted IC, and soon after
this, Phil Singleton sent a
fine ball to the far post for
Dave Rudd to send a blistering
header past a stranded 'Keeper
- 2—1, and more to come.
A flowing move down the
left ended with P h i l Singleton,
surely the man of the match,
sending a scorching shot
towards the L S E goal. T h e
shot was good, the save w a s
better. However, IC were
sure to score again, and
little Steve G e e , opportunist
extraordinaire, snapped up a
half-chance to make the
score 3 - 1 . Y o u just c a n ' t ,

having lost our half-back
line, who had been relegated
to the 1st X I . We were thus
forced to change our famous
" s y s t e m " that has brought
us such unqualified s u c c e s s
recently.
Straight from the bully-off
it was obvious that the
defence w a s finding it
hard to adjust and the
I opposition quickly took a
one goal lead. A second
goal followed some good
play from the opposition's
fast and skilful wings. T h e
IC defence now began to
find its f e e t (and the
opposition forwards!) and
this gave confidence to the
other players and we came
back strongly to force a goal.
The second half w a s
remarkable for the umpires
sudden loss of interest
in upholding the off-side
rule. T h i s led to the opposition
scoring 3 goals with no
reply from IC.

second-half display from IC,
surely their best of the
season.
Reviews continued
Composed during the Christmas period of
1734, Bachs Christmas Oratorio shone
brilliantly in a blaze of gusto and enthusiasm
witnessed by a packed audience in the
Great H a l l last Friday night. T h e Choir,
despite a twinge of understrength in the
soprano section, produced an uncharacter-
istic warmth in their singing which was a
fitting match to the beauty and complexity
of one of B a c h ' s legendary works. T h e
Oratorio was necessarily abridged, one part
was omitted completely and the libertto was
in E n g l i s h — a wise move.
The s o l o i s t s in my view were slightly
disappointing. The soprano, G I L L I A N J A S O N
was the best Of the bunch. Her singing was
clear, controlled and unexaggerated; there
was littie s h r i l l n e s s . R I C H A R D F R E W E R ,
singing the tenor part, seemed a little too
animated in h i s posture at times. H i s s i n g -
ing was on the whole excellent except that
he was flat on some of the more tricky
passing notes. C H R I S T I N E A S H E R , the
contralto, suffered from a l i s p y ' s ' , and
as a result w a s distracting. Her performance
was not without polish however. If y o u ' l l

forgive the pun, D A V I D W l L S O N - J O H N S O N ,
the bass, was b a s i c a l l y not a bass at a l l
but a baritone. He lacked the necessary
vocal power required in the F clef to invoke
drama into the work.
The s p e c i a l orchestra was lead by J O H N
B A C O N who played confidently throughout.
The strings wer generally adequate but
were sketchy towards the end I felt. The
oboes created a startling warmth and clarity
during the symphony at the beginning of part
two. There the usual ' a c i d i t y ' associated
with oboes was gone a s they appeared almost
to resonate in phase. (Pity about the first
oboe's bum note at the end of part two). T h e
continuo of P R U A S H B E E ('cello) and
C H R I S T O P H E R SHAW (harpsichord) was
faultless, e s p e c i a l l y during the recitatives.
A word of praise must be directed to the
anonymous first trumpet player. In B a c h ' s
time there were no valves on bass instrum-
ents (they only began to be fitted in the 19th
century). T h i s means that a complete scale
was only possible above- F on the bottom
space of the treble stave': below that the
horns were limited (reading downwards) to
middle C , A , F , C , and the F below the bass
stave. With the invention of valves the
complete s c a l e became available throughout
the horn's range; as a result composers have
tended to write horn parts much lower than
Bach did s o it is usually with some
trepidation that modern trumpet players, who
are not used to going so high, approach a
work by B a c h . Not so our anonymous trumpet
player last F r i d a y . ' H e cruised through the
difficult trills in the second aria in part
one and generally managed extremely w e l l .
Congratualations to him.
The conductor, E R I C B R O W N , has
produced e x c e l l e n c e . He and indeed every-
one involved got the ovation which they
richly deserved.
