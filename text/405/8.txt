IC Ladies Boat Club Rules OK! NETBALL
Well most of the time any-
way. Saturday 6th December saw
I C L B C out in force at the Univer
sity of London Boat C l u b . The
reason%
behind this show of maso-
chism, was the U L ladies Winter
Regatta, and with a total of 3
crews and a sculler entering, we
hoped to walk away with a least
one trophy.
It was soon evident that U L
organization was non-existent as
races ran later and later. T h i s
bad organization was partly to
, blame for the novice crew's defeat
in their first heat due to only a
short (2 mins) warm up period.
After a well fought race, they lost
to U L , the final winners.
Our ' C o l l e g e ' crews both woh
their 1st heats e a s i l y , to go
through to the semi-finals. In the
first of these the 'College B ' crew
still shattered after their first race
met Royal Vets (i.e. U L ) . Despite
a good start, it was soon evident
that stamina was not on our s i d e ,
with Royal Vets winning convin-
cingly. (Well, they did have the
stream). '
After lunch, Helen 'wheres the
nearest Youngs Pub?' Natrass,
easily won her first heat (against
Royal Vets) despite the crooked
course she was steering. Our
'College A ' crew, after much
hassling, in order to use our own
boat, were landed with an incom-
plete U L boat. Against a l l odds
they easilt beat St. Mary's II.
Aftera very short interval, during
which Helen narowly lost the
s c u l l s final (she drowned her
sorrows later). The ' A ' crew
were out on the water again, in
their own boat. After groping.
their way through the darkness to
the start (they were now running
very late). The finals started,
IC A ' v ' s Royal V e t s .
The College crew had a bad
start and Royal Vets gained a
length and a half, (they had the
best stream again), but the college
crew fought back a lost narrowly,
by about half a length. T h i s
event completed our first term's
serious rowing when we also
entered the Head of the River
Race for F o u r s . We are sure that
this is an indication of
increasing standards, to be bett-
ered next term.
Our thanks go to Nigel and
Rob for C o x i n g . Dr Levy our
coach and C h a r l i e , for h i s contin-
uing help and encouragement.

with U C taking a substantial

the lead, which once.gained
