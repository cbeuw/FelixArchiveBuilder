The Royal Shakespeare Company in " T h e Return of AJ Raffles"
by Graham Greene. at the Aldwych Theatre.
Having sat through two and a half
hours of this play, I c a n only w i s h that
I had seen the R S C s production of
"Sherlock Holmes" last year. F o r it is
s a i d that Graham Greene's inspiration to
bring A J Raffles back to life came from
that production. Raffles is the antithesis
of Holmes, being an amateur cracksman
and gentleman cricketer, however their
creators were brothers-in-law. I suspect
that EW Hornung, the author of the
Raffles stories, would be turning in his
Edwardian grave at this resurrection of
his gentleman thief.
Hornung left Raffles dead on the
field of battle at Spion K o p , i n the
Boer War, but just as Holmes returned
from the incident at the Reichenbach
F a l l s , so Raffles comes back thinly
d i s g u i s e d as Inspector Mackenzie of
Scotland Y a r d , his greatest adversary; a
disguise . w h i c h a l l s a v e Bunny, the
faithful counterpart of Doctor Watson, c a n
see through, for Raffles forgets that
Mackenzie has a permanently running
nose.
The rather weak plot involves the
theft, at the instigation of L o r d Alfred
Douglas, of gold sovereigns from the
Marquess of Queensberry's safe. T h e
Marguess i s of course the celebrated
patron of boxing and his s o n . L o r d
Alfred, the intimate friend of O s c a r
Wilde, with whom Bunny has recently
spent several years in R e a d i n g gaol.
There are only two characters who
save this play from d i s a s t e r . The first
i s the P r i n c e of Wales, later E d w a r d
VII, who has arranged to spend the
night in the Marquess' bedroom, under
the pseudonym of 'Mr P o r t l a n d ' , w i t h a
L a d y . H i s Royal Highness i s admirably
played by P a u l Rogers w i t h a deep
guttural German accent. He i n s i s t s on
his name as 'Mr P o r t l a n d ' and accepts
Raffles' explanation that he i s Jones
the butler, backed up by the fact that
Jones has brought the best Champagne.
They exchange remiscences as two
gentlemen would. Unfortunately Jones
has failed to reverse h i s waistcoat
from White of a guest to the black worn
by a butler. H R H praises Raffles as a
survivor of Spoin Kop and accepts the
gift of a small s i l v e r box engraved
with the name of general Bofors, which
has been quietly severed from its s i l v e r
c h a i n during Raffles' imprisonment
by the Boers.
Michael Bryant is C a p t a i n von B l i x e n ,
a German spy engaged by the P r i n c e ' 3
nephew, K a i s e r Wilhelm, to steal H R H ' s
most secret love letters. He has been
trained as a waiter i n one of the best
hotels in B e r l i n and remains stiff and
correct, even when persuaded to remove
his waiter's jacket and trousers (Moss
Bros, wouldn't l i k e to find blood stains
on one of their hired s u i t s , would they?),
preparatory to being shot.
Parents looking for a good C h r i s t m a s
outing for the children would be i l l -
advised to take them to this play. What
on the surface seems to be a harmless
thriller i n the Sherlock Homes mould,
is interspersed with scarcely v e i l e d
references to homosexuality and lesbian-
ism. C r i c k e t also comes i n for a beating;
this is Raffles' alternative hobby — he
saved the ashes for E n g l a n d in ' 9 6 . It
becomes quite obvious, by the end of the
play that, i n h i s return, he w i l l be better
cut out for cricke t than for cracksmanship.
It i s only by the intervention of the
P r i n c e of Wales that Inspector Mackenzie
is prevented from s l i p p i n g h i s bracelets
onto the hero.

Good but foolhardy
T h e s e Dramsoc productions just
seem to get worse. " T h e C a p t a i n of
K o p e n i c k " which ran from Tuesday
to Saturday last week in B e i t Theatre
appeared too often to be an example of
amateurism run amok. There i s more
than one contributory factor involved.
F i r s t the play itself is a bum choice.
Set in P r u s s i a around the turn of the
century, Wilhelm Voigt, a derelect
(though not really his own fault) with
not much brain power, finds that without
a work-permit he can't get a job; addition
a l l y , without a job there i s no way
that he can have a work-permit. Neither
can he get a passport, nor a birth
certificate such is the stratified, self-
contradictory bureaucracy of the time.
T h e authorities w i l l not even send him
back tp prison because, in their own
words, "there is not a form for it."
We soon learn that there are b a s i c a l l y
two c l a s s e s of people in existence during
this period: the military, and those
trying to get into the military. Everyone
appears to have an exaggerated f e l i s h
for pretty uniforms (and, o c c a s i o n a l l y ,
anti-semitism).
Eventually returning to p r i s o n , a
submissive Voigt becomes familiar
with military procedures and jargon
through the mock battles staged by the
inmates under the generalship of the
foppish prison governor. On his release
he i s persecuted again by the authorities,
but in an embarrasingly contrived scene
he is mistaken as being ex-military and
so hits on a plan to impersonate an
officer, imprison the mayor of K o p e n i c k ,
disappear, then offer to solve the c a s e for
B e r l i n police in return for a passport —
to be collected after his ten years
i n s i d e . The play is supposed to be based
on fact; the author must have allowed
himself considerable licence i n the
licence i n the transliteration.
A s Voight, J O H N WOODFIN became
more and more credible as the play prog-
ressed. In a difficult part he put in an out-

Kopenick by Carl Zuckmayer (adapted

St o veil.
standing effort and deserves high praise.
T O M S T E V E N S O N too, as Obermuller the
mayor of Kopenick, shone. He certainly
brought some badly needed vivacity onto
the stage. He was totally compelling to
watch, despite his occasional hamming.
J O H N DOWNES produced fleeting glimses
of brilliance on o c c a s i o n , but one felt a l l
too often that we were watching J . D . play-
ing the parts of K a l l e and the police ins -
pector rather than those parts being played
by J . D . A l l credit to him nevertheless for
attempting to brighten things up with
mannerisms,facial expressions and a varied
delivery of dialogue.
The first few scenes are m e r c i l e s s l y
slow; indeed the whole of the first act
(ten scenes in all) seems to be there in
a groanish attempt to give substance to
the meat of the action which takes place
in the last four scenes of the second
(and final) act.
The period of Voigt's recognition of
his fate when the Rixdorf authorities
order him to leave town has its genuine
poignancy smeared in the following
scene by the ill-conceived (from the
playwright's point of view) transition
that he undergoes i n the park from
being a trite nobody to e x i s t i n g as
someone capable of latching on to an
ambitious idea and taking steps to
execute a plan. That scene is an all-time
low in the play per se.
So much for the choice of the play.
The production must also take a lot of
stick. The play looked under-rehearsed
and stale through lack of direction.
With over seventy parts being acted by
thirty players, it is hardly surprising
that many of the cast had but a superficial
understanding of their characters which
often came across as pale p a s t i c h e s . But
let us deal with the good guys first.
Of the minor parts, mention should be
made of S T E V E R A N D A L L (an excel lent
porter, but he c o u l d have strutted more as
the grenadier and sergeant), R O G E R
P H I L L I P S (good sense of occasion and
timing), M A T T H E W C L E M E N T S (facial
reactions excellent), SIMON L E A (confid-
ent with good mannerisms), A N D R E W
M A X W E L L (understood his characters) and
J U L I A ROSS (compelling as the mayor's
slattern wife). Zero out of ten must go to
M I K E * E L K I N whose permanently smiling
features were a distraction and appeared to
reflect a lack of interest in what he was
doing. Many of the other minor parts were
characterised by bad picking-up of cues,
and little thought being given to the timing
of pauses.
That brings me to the director, E R I C
S T O V E L L . T o attempt an ambitious prod-
uction with a cast of thirty is in my view
foolhardiness in the extreme. The direction
in the first act needed a much tighter grip
on the cast. It rather appeared that the
director had taken minimal, interest in the
way the players were acting their parts.
A c t two was a large improvement overall
the scenes were finally beginning to have
cohesion, but with a few exceptions they
s t i l l tended to fall short of the mark. One
line was something like, 'Its OK.The
excitement's over' I grimaced for, there
had been no 'excitement' in that scene at
a l l .
The costumes were, on the whole,
excellent; the convict's attire was stunning
The sets were extremely well constructed
and the music throughout was very skilfully
chosen. Make-up too was above par.
Whilst one can recognise the huge
amount of time and effort which goes into
such a production, one is nevertheless
forced to wonder if Dramsoc were simply
using this play as a vehicle to initiate
their new (and as yet inexperienced)
memifcers. The ethic is questionable"
