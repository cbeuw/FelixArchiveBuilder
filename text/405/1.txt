Travel lose
£250,000
A U D I T E D A C C O U N T S presented at the NUS Annual
conference in Scarborough last weekend revealed that
the travel section of the NUS services made a loss of
about £250,000 in the financial year to end in May 1976.
The accounts cover the seventeen months of trading to
May 1976.
Several ' reasons are given for
the loss incurred; including the
fact that the accounts covers two
Winter periods, — September to
May, — which are s l a c k seasons.
Other factors contributing to the
loss are the general depression in
the travel business, increase in

fuel costs and the closure of
Greek airspace during their peak
week last August.
In a move to eradicate this
loss, NUS Travel is making dras-
tic cuts in its services next term.
Although they w i l l be promoting
their fours, rail cards and ISIC
cards heavily with the help of
constituent organizations, the
publicity department's budget is
being slashed by £50.000. The
next ' N U S Traveller' to be printed
w i l l have fewer pages and is to be
distributed by local NUS areas
thus saving NUS Travel a c o n s i d -
erable expense.
M i k e N a y l o r , M a n a g i n g Director
of NUS Travel says that a profit
of between £50,000 and £100,000
tp keep the company as an on-
goingviabi lity. T h e i r m a i n problem
was one of cash flow, C O ' s could
help by p u b l i c i s i n g NUS Travel
and many have already agreed to
do so through their local student
papers.
It would a l s o be possible
next year for many more students
to take their friends on hoi iday
with them because 80—85% of the
tours to be provided contain no
e l i g i b i l i t y c l a u s e s .
Although there is great concern
being expressed about the situa-
tion, the position should improve
given that NUS Travel receives
the cooperation it needs.
If NUS Travel were to collapse
then E n d s l e i g h Insurance would
a l s o fold. The consequences for
the National Union would be d i s -
astrous and in a l l probability
N U S ' s campaign department would
have to cease a c t i v i t i e s .
In this case of such an event-
uality, students on holiday would
not find themeselves stranded
abroad due to the bonding system
that NUS Travel h a s .
