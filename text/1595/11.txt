Choreography award too.
Exeter’s all-girls group, Sweet
Nothings, also qualified into this
stage of the competition. “There’s
definitely a bit of rivalry going on
here, especially because we’re an
all-girls team and they’re an all-
boys team as well,” they tell me.
“But it’s also healthy competition,
of course; having another team to
simultaneously compete against and
support you is really great.” Their set
was a seriously emotional one, full of
deep meaning and heart-wrenching
melodies.
Diversity and novelty are one of the
cornerstones of a successful a cappella
group, giving rise to the more sassy
and interesting performances we see
today. The Techtonics take this belief
to another level: they deliberately
don’t have a set style, motto, credo,
or any rules at all to stick by when
coming up with routines. “It’s the
members which define the group, not
the other way round,” they tell me.
Previous members often come to
their concerts or watch them busking
on Portobello Road on Saturday
mornings to see which direction the
group has taken since their departure.
All the King’s Men hold the same
view, with Sara telling me that
the group plays to each member’s
strengths and highlights the talents
within the group.
“I’m a soul singer, so I get those
kinds of solos, but we also have
everything from pop to choral
arrangements, simply because we
have those kinds of singers who
specialise in that stuff.”
Indeed, their performance did
feature a choral arrangement, as
well as hits from Wham and Tina
Turner – winning their arranger the
Outstanding Arrangement award.
Their amazing display of excellence
all around secured them their first
place and the coveted entry in the
ICCA Finals – but by only two points,
371 to Semi-Toned’s 369.
The hosts and guest stars, former
competition winners turned
professional, The Sons of Pitches,
were engaging and creative with the
audience throughout the evening.
Formed in Birmingham in 2010,
which is actually more recent than
some of the competition entrants,
they received many awards over the
years for their singing.
After winning the ICCA’s
International Wildcard Round in
2013 and competing in New York
for the finals, The Sons of Pitches
went on to become a professional a
cappella ensemble, hosting these sorts
of events around the country.
Putting on a simultaneously funny
and astounding performance during
the judging, there was never a dull
moment as they kept singing right
up until the judging was finished,
meaning that the audience was always
witnessing some amazing talent, be
it song improvisation on the spot,
renditions of a cappella club remixes,
or inviting audience members on
stage to perform with them. It was an
auditory treat to hear them perform
their first single ‘Laura’ live, with
the assistance of a gospel choir which
managed to sneak itself on backstage.
With the winners now looking to
travel to New York to compete in
the final against teams from around
the world, it is incredible how far a
cappella can take a group of students
used to practising in empty lecture
theatres or deserted seminar rooms.
Felix wishes the best of luck to All
the Kings Men, and will be waiting
eagerly to hear how they get on over
in the States.
