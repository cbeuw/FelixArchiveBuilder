Ben Howitt attends this
term’s Refresher’s Fair.
On Wednesday 28th
January, the
Union’s annual Refresher’s
Fair was held in the Great
Hall. The event featured 24 clubs,
societies and projects, ranging from
RCC Synchro to ACC Tennis and A&E
Dramatic Society.
The event was also attended by a
number of Imperial’s services and
external companies, including Image
Scotland and Nandos.
From conversations with those
attending, the main takeaway from
the event appears to be that while the
event was in general well organised,
the lack of publicity meant that
attendance from current students was
extremely poor, rendering the point
of the day – to recruit new members –
less than effective.
When asked about how the day
had gone Abi De Bruin, the Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies), said “it’s
good to see so much engagement from
student volunteers”.
The event was indeed well attended
by societies, with spaces in fact
running out fairly quickly. A number
of new clubs and societies attended,
including Vehicle Design, Lib Youth
and Imperial Obstacle Course Racing
(IOCR).
Lib Youth seemed dissatisfied,
placing the blame on the marketing
of the Fair, and claiming that they
had “wasted the day”. By contrast,
IOCR had a pleasant experience,
having benefited extensively from
their location at the Fair: directly
next to Nandos.
The Nandos stand was, arguably,
the runaway star of the day, featuring
– in addition to their normal offers –
a ‘Wheel’o’Chilli’ and a large chicken
costume.
Despite this, Abi made a fair
point with regards to student
engagement. Many of the volunteers
I spoke to over the day seemed
positive, outgoing, and enthusiastic.
Recruitment for incoming committee
members was proceeding well too,
with numerous first years attending
to represent their new societies.
It is possible that attendance was
limited owing to the fact that exam
season had only just finished, or to a
lack of society publicity – certainly,
there was less social media presence
than the Fresher’s Fair at the
beginning of the year.
However, there seems to have been
a breakdown in communication.
Many people, when asked, were
unaware that the event even existed,
The New Acivities Committee has
made no less than 25 new clubs
and societies so far this year,with
more midway through the process.
Here’s the irst of the new
student groups to be agitating for
your attention at any opportunity.
If you don't see what you want
here or on the Union website,
why not create it? There will be an
article next week on how societies
get created.
Medecin Sans Frontieres
MSF society is a group to raise
awareness,debates and fundraising
regarding the work that the charity
(Medicines Sans Frontieres) does.
There are a number of members
from medicine and other courses.
This term,we are hosting the
National MSF Conference–the
Humanitarian Forum at Imperial
on March 21st
this year.We had
a fundraiser last week with
music,comedy,a raffle and other
entertainment which raised £1000.
For the third year running,we are
organising the annual MSF London
Funrun–last year raising £7000.
Vehicle Design
Vehicle Design is a society that aims
to give students the opportunity to
be creative with their ideas for new
and innovative vehicular technology.
It acts as a platform,supporting
student led projects and providing
an environment in which any
design,however big or small,may be
implemented.
Starting last term,we already have
three major projects underway: the
CubeSat Project,the EcoMarathon,
and the Solar Challenge.This term,
we will be really making headway
as the projects begin to gain
momentum.
Empower
Empower is the female support
network that aims to foster
professional skill development
whilst promoting self-conidence
and wellbeing.
Coming up this term are Percept–a
safe space for men to discuss gender
equality in a non-confrontational
group,and the WomeninScience
campaign,to raise awareness of
female scientists.
Finally,we have BeautifulBeings,
a campaign which tackles the
portrayal of women in the media
and aims to shift the focus towards
achievements over“blemishes”.
Tandem
We are a society for both men and
women,which aims to work with
businesses and Imperial College
London to promote awareness of
gender equality in the workplace.
We want to help students
understand that it is no longer a
“female issue”but an issue which
concerns us all.
This term we will be launching
our web presence.We will also be
conducting a number of interviews
on gender equality,and hosting
a panel discussion in March with
representatives from various
different industries.
and fewer knew that it was taking
place on the Wednesday.
It is a shame that this opportunity
to promote student activity was so
poorly attended, and I hope that more
efforts are made in the future.
CSPB, though, and this clause is up for
discussion.
Funding is also given out by
ICTrust to assist students in attending
conferences to present their research.
This is more useful to the Graduate
Students’ Union, and to individual
students, but Departmental Societies
get a look in too.
Perhaps more tantalising is the
Exploration Board, which takes as
its mission statement “to support
projects that reach a balance between
straightforward scientific research
and an adventurous holiday.” More
specifically, it funds expeditions
with scientific merit, with recent
destinations including Mongolia, Peru
and Svalbard.
The board has recognised 98
expeditions since its creation in 1955.
Over a third of these took place in
2001-2010, after a quiet few decades
starting in the 1970s.
Sport/Arts Imperial
Many clubs, particularly those in the
ACC, compete in BUCS tournaments,
for which extensive funding is
awarded by Sport Imperial. Funding
is also allocated in a second round to
non-BUCS sports with benefit to the
College.
A similar scheme, Arts Imperial,
runs to assist the various performing
arts societies on campus, as well as
to administrate the Blyth centre,
which provides practice facilities
for instrumentalists at the College.
The funding available from Arts
Imperial is significantly less, owing to
the increased difficulty in obtaining
sponsorship for clubs not competing
on a weekly basis.
Departments
As well as money from the College,
a number of societies (particularly
Departmental societies) get funding
directly from their departments. This
usually takes the form of subsidy for a
specific event, like an alumni dinner.
Departments can also help out clubs
by offering room space for meetings.
Self Generated Income
Perhaps the principle method of
obtaining cash to run activities comes
under the admittedly broad title of
‘Self Generated Income’ (SGI).
This can take the form of ticket
sales, membership fees, sponsorship
arrangements, or simple donations
from alumni or generous members of
the public.
