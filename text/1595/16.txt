Joshua Renken gives a spoiler-
free overview of the U.S. Netlix
hit show, House of Cards
The Best Show Not
On Television
Based on the novels by Michael
Dobbs and the British political
drama by Andrew Davies,
House of Cards is a Netflix original
series that follows U.S. Congressman
and Majority Whip Francis
Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey,
who after being denied the position
he was promised of Foreign Secretary
in a new democratic cabinet sets out
to take revenge on the administration
he helped to elect and take the
Presidency for himself. The series
also stars Robin Wright as Frank’s
chilling wife Claire, and Kate Mara
as the young journalist Zoe Barnes,
who forges a secret relationship with
Frank in a desperate attempt to get
her professional break.
House of Cards is an American
remake of the four-part 1990
miniseries of the same name and
signifies a real landmark in the
continuing evolution of television
production and consumption. Netflix
chose to upload each of 13-episode
web television series all in one
go, dispensing with the television
convention of releasing an episode
every week. The first two seasons of
House of Cards have been released on
the February of each year beginning
in 2013 and the third series will be
put up on the site on Feb 27th.
At the centre of this show lies the
enigmatic relationship between Frank
and Claire Underwood. This pair of
two-faced, power crazed sociopaths
have created a successful partnership
built on a fierce mutual respect and
candid communication that allows
them to overcome the conflicts that
emerge as they rise up the political
food chain. Constantly scheming
about future events, Frank and Claire
often share a single cigarette late at
night to discuss their strategies for
the next day. Their marriage is filled
with sexual promiscuity and secrets
on both sides, but somehow their
reciprocal admiration and shared
sense of ambition overrides these
problems to create a sleek and highly
utilitarian relationship that works for
both of them.
A self-made man with a thick
southern drawl, Frank shows
little personal regard for political
ideology, instead favouring “ruthless
pragmatism”. He is a master of
persuasion and political manoeuvring
who is remorseless in his acquisition
of power for power’s sake. As Claire
says: “He’s a man who knows how
to take what he wants”. Frank has
sexual liaisons with both men and
women during the series, but he is
never explicitly identified as gay
or bisexual. At one point after a
conversation with his wife, Frank
declares: “I love that woman. I love
her more than sharks love blood.”
This comparison suggests a kind of
animalistic passion but could just
have been included by the writers
to draw attention to the Frank’s
bloodthirsty and visceral obsession
with power that Claire encourages
and facilitates. She is a constant
source of empowerment for him. “My
husband doesn’t apologize,” she tells
him after a setback. “Even to me.”
Some have suggested that Frank is
secretly gay, but becomes attracted to
women due to the sense of dominance
that it gives him. “A great man once
said, everything is about sex. Except
sex. Sex is about power.” This famous
Oscar Wilde quote seems especially
pertinent when it comes to Frank’s
sexuality.
Frank Underwood first attended
military academy before going onto
Harvard Law, where he met Claire.
It was her parents that bankrolled
Frank’s political campaigns early
on. His political success stems from
his ability to subtly sway people
to act in the way that best suits his
interests. This is easier to do in some
that others, but Frank always finds a
way to beat his opponents. In House
of Cards you are led to believe that
Frank and Claire are both ready to
do anything that is required, that
there is no end to the depths of their
depravity.
One of the most refreshing aspects
of this series is the regularity with
which Frank Underwood ‘breaks
the fourth wall’ and talks directly to
the viewer. There are many critical
moments in conversations when
Underwood will lean in and face the
camera, giving a pithy explanation
to help elucidate the gravity of the
situation. Frank also likes to reflect
on other character’s misgivings
and weaknesses. After one heated
exchange between himself and a
former staffer, Frank professes his
strong preference for power over
money. “Money is the McMansion
in Sarasota that starts falling apart
after 10 years. Power is the old stone
building that stands for centuries. I
cannot respect someone who doesn’t
see the difference.”
Frank’s straight-to-camera
monologues make the experience
of watching House of Cards feel that
much more personal and indulgent
to watch than other series. And this
component works especially well
when you consider the way many
people are watching it – individually
on their laptops. Frank’s intimate
disclosures help the audience to see
things from his perspective; where
other characters are regarded as
little more than pawns that he can
manipulate. This show is awash
with great lines from Frank and his
soliloquies work very well to add
some nuance to the series.
Frank is one of that strange
breed of characters; a likeable
villain. One other likeable villain
is Shakespeare’s Richard III, who is
coincidentally the last character that
Kevin Spacey played before stepping
into Underwood’s shoes. Richard III
breaks the fourth wall in the original
play and there are actually a great
many parallels that can be drawn
between House of Cards and two of
Shakespeare’s greatest plays: Richard
III and Macbeth.
Beau Willimon writes Underwood’s
monologues exceedingly well. For
example in a scene where he is
alone in a church after a significant
service, he speaks the lines: “There
is no solace above or below, only us,
small, solitary, striving, battling one
another, I pray to myself for myself”.
Almost every line is quotable.
Borderline poetry.
The very first words that Frank
utters in the first episode are: “There
are two kinds of pain. The sort of
pain that makes you strong, or useless
pain. The sort of pain that’s only
suffering. I have no patience for
useless things.” (He strangles a dog to
end it’s suffering after a car collision)
“There. No more pain.”
Robin Wright gives a career topping
performance as Claire Underwood,
the Lady Macbeth of modern day
Washington. Claire is a lobbyist and
runs an environmental nonprofit
organization, while acting as Frank’s
primary accomplice. She is every bit
as hungry for power as her husband
and in many ways, comes across as
even more insidious than Frank.
Claire is clinical and considered in
her actions, with a cold exterior and
the capacity for barbaric threats if the
moment demands. “I am willing to let
your child wither and die inside you,
if that’s what’s required” stands out as
a particularly memorable instance of
hostility towards a former employee.
Claire is very much the ice-queen of
American politics.
House of Cards does a great job at
showing the wheels of democracy
in action and shines a light, albeit
a dim one, at the ugly culture of
private scheming and negotiation
that goes on in Washington behind
closed doors. It’s not pretty, but it’s
certainly exhilarating and you cannot
help but be stimulated by the candid
conversation. Favours are constantly
being exchanged that range from
money, information and public
backing to sex or getting people’s kids
into the right Colleges. Washington is
portrayed as a relentless dog-eat-dog
arena full of secrets, where people
blur the boundaries between private
and public incentives to get ahead. In
House of Cards we see that politics is a
dirty game played by smart people. If
the idealism and romanticism of The
West Wing gave you faith in politics,
"I love that
woman I
love her
more than
sharks love
blood."
“Power
is the
old stone
building
that
stands for
centuries.”
