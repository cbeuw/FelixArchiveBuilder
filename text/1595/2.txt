This week we are covering the
lack of funding available for
medical students in their final
years, as a recent survey has found
that some are seriously struggling to
make ends meet. Jennie Watson, the
Imperial College School of Medicine
Students’ Union (ICSMSU) Welfare
officer and the driving force behind
the survey, came to Felix when she
found that the situation may have
been more worrying than once
thought.
Going through the data was grim,
especially when looking at students’
income and outgoings, along with
the free text responses students had
submitted. However, what does seem
odd is how this issue has seemingly
never been raised before. Do many
students just suffer in silence, and
chalk it up to the experience of being
a poor student in London?
However, what is more shocking
is how the lack of funding for these
students compares to the large
bursaries showered down on other
undergraduates. With the bursary
change for the next academic year
looking to reward students with the
lowest household income £4000
more than the College estimates
should be enough to cover total living
costs, one could argue that the system
could be a lot better balanced.
Just as the bursary change this
year ensured those with less bursary
because of higher household income
now get a bit more, maybe addressing
those who are arguably under the
most pressure, and at such a critical
point in their medical degree, is the
next step.
It is great that Imperial offers
all these student support funds,
but maybe College should also be
investing in making sure these
students don’t reach such a dire point
as to have to apply for such funds in
the first place.
Obviously we need to consider
the fact that students who filled in
the survey may be biased, in that
those already struggling are more
inclined to fill it in, but at the same
time, average figures don’t lie. You
don’t have to ask clinical medical
students to find out how high rent
is nowadays, how much travel is
and how easy it is for money to
simply run out before the next loan
instalment.
With Imperial attracting more and
more international students who
are already paying extortionate fees,
and the number of home students
choosing not to study in London
because of the cost, the system
needs to shift in order to keep us
comfortably in the capital and make
it worth travelling to study here in
the first place. We know Imperial
isn’t quite made of money, but I
reckon it has a bit more rattling
around in its big old endowment
purse that students would be
extremely grateful for.
