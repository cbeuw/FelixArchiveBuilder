then House of Cards will swipe it
away with unsettling rapidity. This
is not a show that gives you faith in
humanity.
One of the problems with House
of Cards is that the Underwoods
are implausibly effective at getting
what they want, to the point where
other characters seem slow and
uncalculating by comparison.
President Walker, for instance,
is unrealistically susceptible to
manipulation. Given that it appears
to take a man as Machiavellian as
Frank to make it to the top spot,
Garrett Walker is remarkably easy
prey.
Another issue with House of Cards
is that, so far, Frank has not been
seriously challenged yet. Sure, he’s
experienced small setbacks but
nothing that has really tested him
or pushed him anywhere near his
breaking point. Great television
series of the past such as Breaking Bad,
The Wire and The Sopranos allowed
the audience to see the weaknesses
in their protagonists, whether they
were a hero or anti-hero. But the
writers for House of Cards have
so far produced a plot that only
serves obstacles that the audience is
confident Underwood can conquer.
However, series three is likely to put
an end to this.
There is no denying that House of
Cards is Kevin Spacey’s show. It’s all
about Frank. This makes all the other
subplots pale in comparison and you
quickly begin to lose interest. The
guinea-pig wielding cyberterrorist in
series two for instance, and even Zoe’s
ex-boyfriend’s investigations, is far
less interesting than whatever Frank
is doing. House of Cards has some of
the best individual scenes I’ve ever
seen on the small screen but the show
bounces around a little more than
want it to and the plot feels disjointed
as a result.
Throughout House of Cards there are
some startling moments that come
out of nowhere and are never referred
to again. A lot of these events are
significant to the character’s involved
but do not contribute one jot towards
the overall storyline. Since all of
these moments have so far remained
unexplored it looks as though the
writer’s just shoehorned some
surprising twists into the script for
shock value, much to the detriment
of the overall series. It smacks of a last
minute attempt to add intrigue but
on reflection these moments feel like
hollow shocks, with nothing behind
them to add to the story.
Credit must go to the
cinematographer Eigil Bryld for
creating such an enthralling and
secretive atmosphere, even when
a scene is being filmed in broad
daylight. The production quality
generally is first class. Several
directors have shot two or three
chapters, but David Fincher’s early
influence left a strong impression
on the whole show. House of Cards
is beautifully shot and Jeff Beal’s
fantastic soundtrack features a
trickling piano solo that perfectly
captures the sly, calculative mindset
of the characters.
Despite being a political thriller,
"I am
willing to
let your
child
wither
and die
inside you
if that’s
what’s
required."
House of Cards is as much a character
study of Frank than it is a series
about Washington politics. With a
stellar cast and great dialogue, House
of Cards is a delicious meditation on
power and amorality that is confident
in its execution and elegant in its
presentation. It features a universally
excellent set of performances by
the cast and Spacey in particular
must be praised for owning his
demanding character to become one
of television’s best antiheroes.
Ever since its release there has been
a lot of talk about how House of Cards
is a revolutionary piece of television,
but while it is a true pleasure to watch,
it doesn’t bring very much to the table
in terms of commentary that wasn’t
already there before. This is a show
that captured the zeitgeist and turned
it up to eleven, instead of challenging
presumptions. The series takes the
same cynical stance as almost every
other political show in the last few
decades that wasn’t written by Aaron
Sorkin. House of Cards is a series that
tells us mostly what we already know,
and it does not go about telling it in
as subtle or intelligent a way as, say,
Mad Men or Breaking Bad. In the
whole series, the most striking and
fresh aspect of House of Cards is the
dynamic between Frank and Claire.
Despite Frank’s morally
irreprehensible behavior and
twisted morality, there is a curious
temptation to will him on, to see how
far the Underwood’s can get before
it all falls apart. Frank is the kind
of unscrupulous political operator
that we all hope doesn’t really exist.
"There is
no denying
that House
of Cards
is Kevin
Spacey’s
show."
The idea that democracy is a veil
for the rich and powerful to exert
huge influence is a terrifying one;
but crucially, it is a compelling one.
We all want to see how Frank’s story
plays out. Will he become President
and succeed as leader of the free
world, or will his meteoric ascent end
up collapsing like… well like a House
of Cards?
Best served in the form of late night
binges, House of Cards is very good at
persuading you to click ‘Next Episode’
when you should probably go to bed.
It’s a heavyweight piece of television,
just as Netflix is now a heavyweight
content provider. All there is to say is
give it a go. Soon you’ll be hypnotized.
Series 3 will be on Netflix Feb. 27th.
