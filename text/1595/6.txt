The results of an online vote
taken last week by members of
Union Council were released on
Monday.
However, it appears that several
votes were counted despite being after
the stated deadline for votes to be
submitted.
The fifth Union Council meeting
took place on 13th
January, the first
Tuesday of term. 21 members of
Council were present, out of a total
of 55, which meant that the meeting
was not quorate and therefore there
would not be enough people to vote
and to make any decisions.
Instead of a physical vote, the
decisions were instead passed by
an email vote that was set up the
following week. Council members
were told that they had until 12:00
Friday 16th
January to reply with
their decisions on three of the papers.
The email vote was answered by 27
members, including three cast after
the deadline.
The most debated paper by far is
that regarding publishing a voting
record of any decisions passed by
Council. The standard procedure has
previously been a vote by show of
hands, or by secret ballot in the case
of a confidential vote.
However, publishing votes would
hold the elected Union officers
accountable to accurately represent
the opinions of the wider Imperial
population.
Social Clubs Committee (SCC) Chair
Tom Rivlin, told Felix: “I just agreed
with the principle of the proposal [to
publish people’s votes]… I represent
‘constituents’ who chose me to
represent them. They have the right
to know if I’m doing what’s in their
best interests.”
In contrast, an ordinary member
who wished to remain anonymous
stated “members might feel cornered
into voting according to popular
opinion, instead of voting according
to what they feel is the correct path of
action”.
Royal College of Science Union
(RCSU) Secretary Philip Kent also
offered an opinion “arguments have
been made for this making the Union
more democratic – personally I would
rather Council put more effort into
increasing student awareness and
engagement with Council rather than
spending hours on something which I
suspect few people will ever look at”.
Dariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli,
Imperial College School of Medicine
Student Union President (ICSMSU),
proposed additional responsibilities
to the Deputy President’s role and
the creation of a Sponsorship Officer,
which would outline clearer end-year
goals for the Deputy President and
bring more money to the ICSMSU
Executive committee. He also
proposed the removal of one of two
Social Secretaries, as one person could
easily achieve the responsibilities.

Prince Charles
opens new centre
at St. Mary’s
Anew centre for innovative
surgery has been opened by
Prince Charles, the Prince of
Wales, at St. Mary’s Hospital. The new
centre, created and run by Imperial
College London, has been set up to
develop new surgical techniques –
specifically ones which can make
surgery quicker and easier.
The Surgical Innovation Centre, as
it is called, is directed by Professor
the Lord Darzi, who said “The NHS
is under considerable pressure in
meeting the challenge of shifting
patient demographics, the burden
of lifestyle disease and financial
constraints. Innovation through
better technologies, processes and
design can help address the challenges
facing health care delivery globally.”
The centre features two state-of-the-
art surgical theatres and is also the
country’s leading centre for bariatric
surgery (carrying out operations such
as gastric bypass procedures).
Developments seen by the heir to
the throne include surgery through a
person’s belly button, which prevents
scarring, and ‘cyclops’, which is an
expanding ring which can be inflated
inside the body to remove growths.
A number of techniques for medical
teaching have also been created at the
centre, including a full-scale touch-
screen skeleton model.
As part of the same event, the
Prince of Wales also visited the
Health Innovation Exchange (HELIX)
pop-up studio, a collaboration with
the Royal College of Art, which
utilises design techniques to treat
diseases and prevent common
healthcare issues.
At the HELIX studio, an app for
analysing children’s breathing
patterns to detect signs of asthma was
also demonstrated to the Prince.
Prince Charles told reporters, “I
was fascinated going around, trying
to understand how you managed to
create all these innovative inventions.
My great great great grandfather
Prince Albert would have been very
proud.”
In the past year, nearly 2,000
patients have been treated at
the centre as part of usual NHS
procedures. The centre can also
provide same-day consultation,
diagnosis, and treatment.
PHILIP KENT
DEPUTY EDITOR
The last paper presented was on
increasing the frequency of Union
General Meetings (GM), the purposes
of which are to enable all members of
the Union to vote on policy decisions
and to hold officers to account.
Ironically, neither the last GM and
the Council meeting met their quora
of 200 and 27 respectively.
An email detailing the vote’s results
was released to all Council members
on Friday last week, and included
time stamps to confirm when the
online votes were received through a
online Google form. When concerns
were raised about the security of the
voting method, Council Chair Paul
Beaumont agreed to verify the votes
with all Council members.
Three votes made by students, one
as late as three days later, were still
counted. Had they been disqualified,
the email vote would have also failed
to make quorum, and the papers
would have to be discussed at the next
meeting.
The email vote passed the changes
to the ICSMSU constitution (26 for,
2 abstentions) and agreed to publish
individuals’ voting records (13 for,
9 against, 6 abstentions), while the
paper on increasing GM frequency
was rejected (9 for, 12 against, 7
abstentions).
Although many of the absences
were due to start-of-term exams,
Council Chair Paul Beaumont
expressed disappointment at the
turnout, telling Felix last week that
“it is a pity that some members of
Council do not attend at all”.
Said the Union on the votes
accepted after the deadline: “The
deadline was an indicative date
for when Council members were
instructed to have recorded their
votes, it was never detailed that votes
counted after that date would not be
counted.
“The vote was ratified at the point
the Council Chair did the count and
decided to accept all votes cast.
“The votes cast after the initially
publicised time did not affect the
outcome of any of the votes, but did
enable the vote to reach quorum.”
