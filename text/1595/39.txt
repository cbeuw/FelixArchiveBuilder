How Chang Hong on planning the irst Enactus week at Imperial
The greater good vs. your degree
It feels like winter break has just
ended. I thought I was ready to
take on the new term after the
recharge.
I have never felt so wrong.
Coursework, examinations,
socials, societies and sports. How
am I supposed to juggle them all?
Drowning… drowning... drowning...
If you are feeling exactly this, you
are not alone. I am part of Enactus,
a society promoting entrepeneurial
action at Imperial, and I am planning
the upcoming Enactus Week (2th
Feb
- 6th
Feb) amidst all the school work to
be done. I know it is not easy but let
me share with you how I manage.
Get organised.
It is important that you pen down
all your responsibilities and
commitments. Next prioritise these
tasks and put them into your daily
schedule.
This is crucial so that you do not
procrastinate and leave the tasks
undone. I do this once a week every
Sunday night to plan for the week
ahead so that I am able to align and
prepare myself for what is coming
next.
Let your creativity flow.
Following Osborne, there are
two main guiding principles for
brainstorming: ‘Reach for Quantity’
and ‘Defer Judgement’. No ideas are
ever too crazy and indeed, it is often
the crazy ideas that will attract the
greatest crowd.
Try also to choose events that are
interactive so that you can engage
your audience more! For example,
we are planning to have Vietnamese
speciality taster sessions and soap
making sessions!
Preparation.
Prepare everything that you need for
the event. Often the small things that
are easily missed out will make or
spoil the event.
Hence, visualise the event in your
mind, jotting down everything that
you envisioned, from venue to tables
and publicity materials.
So plan early, plan meticulously;
and if you’re planning an event at
Imperial, bear in mind that room
bookings must be done at least 2
weeks in advance!
Get excited!
The success of an event is determined
by the enthusiasm of the organisers.
Show the crowd you love what you do
and you believe in what you do! The
smile on your face is infectious and
you have the power to put a smile on
the participants’ faces as well!
So what are you waiting for? Get
started, get planning and, if you have
any time left over, head down to visit
our stalls at the JCR during the first
week of February!

Investment Society
Investment society's main aim is to
provide an environment for students
to learn from each other,through
stock presentations and discussions.
A company is pitched to the
members at our weekly meetings,
and the members vote on whether
we will take up a position in our
virtual £100,000 portfolio.
This term we'll be continuing with
our weekly Tuesday meetings,and
we'll be handing over responsibility
to individual students who will
gather reports and provide the
material for the meetings.We'll also
be publishing a monthly newsletter!
Krishna Consciousness
The Krishna Consciousness Society
at Imperial offers a platform to
evolve the mind,give direction in life
and reveal a deeper level of insight
by connecting with like-minded
people.
The main activities that the KC
society will hold are workshops,
where a guest speaker will chair
enriching and thought provoking
discussions about topics that
students can really relate to such
as relationships,habits,stress,
lifestyles,faith and doubt.Another
event that we are keen to run again
is‘Engineering a Better World’.
Socratic Society
Promoting philosophical discussions
amongst the Imperial College
population,the Socratic Society
aims to provide a platform to
encourage interactions between
leading philosophers in academia
and anybody interested in learning
more about philosophy.
We aim to nurture a culture
for philosophical dicscussions at
Imperial by running trips to other
philosophy societies around London,
host various guest speakers and to
run socials to get to know each other,
to provide a forum for exchanging
ideas.
ICSM Careers Network
The Medics Careers society has been
split into a number of new societies,
forming the ICSM Careers Network.
From an external point of view,
whilst all the societies have similar
aims (i.e.to provide specialty-
focussed activities to interested
students) one could easily be led
to believe that all these careers
societies do the same type of
events.This is far from the truth;
the activities range from GP Soc's
weekly debates to Radiology Soc's
inal year teaching to conferences
hosted by O&G Soc and Heart Soc
to the very successful volunteering
schemes such as: Paediatric
Society's Play Team (student
volunteers provide out-of-
hours play time for in-patient
children at St Mary's Hospital)
and Psychiatry Soc's Open Minds
(teaching school children about
mental health awareness).
The future of healthcare
depends on collaborative cross-
discipline participation–how
else are we going to cure cancer?
