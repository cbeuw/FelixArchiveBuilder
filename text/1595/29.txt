The Fury
of the
Mockingjay
This week, Imperial Cinema
brings you not one, but two
offerings from the land of film:
the third entry in the Hunger
Games franchise, as well as a
WWII tank epic.
First up, Jennifer Lawrence
returns as Katniss Everdeen,
the unwilling figurehead of a
rebellion against the evil Capitol
in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay
– Part One. After her dramatic
escape from the arena at the end
of the previous film, Katniss
is now forced to choose where
her loyalties lie – to protect her
family, or to become something
more: to become the Mockingjay.
After that, it’s time for David
Ayer’s scorching war film Fury.
Set in the last days of the war,
it follows Logan Lerman as
Norman Ellison, a new recruit
into Brad Pitt’s tank crew. As
the Allies push onwards into
Germany, Norman is forced to
question his moral code – are
the Germans really as evil as he’s
been taught to believe?
Mockingjay: 18:30 Tuesday 3rd
February and 21:15 Thursday 5th
February.
Fury: 21:00 Tuesday 3rd
February and 18:30 Thursday 5th
February.

Malone) is searching for her missing
husband Coy (Owen Wilson), a
saxophone player who mysteriously
disappeared. Somehow these cases are
all interlinked.
Having seen the film, it is still
not 100% clear as to how this is
the case. But as more supporting
characters drift in and out of the
film’s narrative, the audience gets to
see that there is an overlying big story
that somehow connects everything
and everyone.
Doc’s investigation leads to all
sorts of weird and wonderful places
and also to confusing clues that go
with them – the DA’s office where
his lover Penny Kimball (Reese
Witherspoon) gives some sound
advice, a brothel, a mysterious boat, a
drug trafficking plot, and a dentist’s
office (huh?) all feature in his search
for the truth. It soon becomes clear
that it is not just about discovering
who is behind the crime that matters,
but the why as well.
There are some quality
performances to feast your eyes on.
Phoenix gives the role his all, as the
mildly eccentric, but entirely capable
PI hopped up on a never-ending
supply of cannabis among other
recreational drugs, and the tough,
macho Josh Brolin rocks up in the
role of LAPD Detective Christian
‘Bigfoot’ Bjornsen to constantly lock
horns with Doc, in a performance to
be remembered. Martin Short also
deserves praise for his incredibly
brief but hysterical turn as a highly
disturbing dentist who preys on the
young, helpless patients he is referred.
Anderson is in no rush to get
anywhere with solving the mystery.
He takes his time to chill out every
now and again and have a laugh
with his cast of quirky actors, and
some brutally honest third-person
narration. It is a film that will often
test your patience, but it does not
promise high rewards either. So you
be the judge. Love it or hate it, this is
Anderson doing what he does best.
doing once he gets out after serving
his time? The escape goes smoothly,
but things are far from over for those
now on the run from the law. It all
seems like a pretty great, glamorous
life to begin with. The criminal life
does indeed have its perks. Shady
lawyers make it possible to move
money and weapons around, as well
as providing a more than comfortable
place for them all to stay. There are
trust issues however, and loyalties are
tested as time goes by.
Making matters more complicated
is the introduction of a love interest,
probably the least well-written
2015 Screen Actors Guild
character in the entire film. Tasha
(Alicia Vikander) and JR form an
incomprehensibly close bond in a
very short period of time, one that
is forced upon the characters for the
sake of the story having something
else to concentrate on. Despite the
talented young actors that they are,
both Thwaites and Vikander cannot
sell the blind romance that motivates
these young characters, mostly
because they have very little to go on.
Everything remains very small in
scale. The prison breakout scene, and
further action scenes that are shown
are done so with minimal flashy
effects and with as much focus paid to
spending less. It is a welcome change
from regularly seeing everything
go up in flames, with sequences
appearing tighter, more intimate and
character-driven.
McGregor keeps his act ambiguous
throughout, being the supportive
mentor figure when the situation
calls for it, but at times letting his
fiery temper and inclination towards
violence take over, showing the
side that most possibly landed him
in trouble in the first place. He is a
frightening, dominating force not to
be taken lightly, and has no problem
whipping the young Thwaites into
shape.
It is about always staying one step
ahead of the game; trying to break
free from the toxic clutches of a
criminal whilst also surviving to live
to tell the tale.
Whether the power couple succeeds
or not in doing this is hardly a
mystery, but the way they go about
putting one up on Brendan is a touch
on the flimsy side. It tries to end on
a slick, smart note but there is too
little of either qualities for it to be
considered a satisfactory finish, but
overall there is tense fun to be had.
