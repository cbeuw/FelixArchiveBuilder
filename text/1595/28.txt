Six degrees of superheroes
With an exponential rise in
the number of superhero
films hitting the screens
over the next few years, why not have
another one, this time in animated
form? Based on a Marvel comic of
the same name, Walt Disney has
launched a sort-of independent
outing of superheroes who are not
linked to the Marvel Cinematic
Universe in any way.
Set in San Fransokyo, a mixture
of, you guessed it, Tokyo and San
Francisco, we meet the young Hiro
(Ryan Potter), who is obsessed with
his robot and participating in fight
clubs to win a considerable amount of
cash. His small but ingenious creation
is one hell of a skilled fighter, and
even from this young age Hiro shows
promise for the robotics. His older
brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) and
his team of fellow robot scientists,
GoGo (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon
Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis
Rodriguez) and Fred (T. J. Miller),
all serve as an inspiration for Hiro’s
further development in the field of
robotics.
But a mysterious fire and
subsequent explosion leaves Tadashi
dead, plus an important part of Hiro’s
work stolen by a masked villain
who intends on mass destruction.
The identity of the bad guy is not
difficult to suss out, but for a film
aimed mainly at children to attempt
an intricate plot twist demonstrates
an admirable addition of originality
into what otherwise would have
been a straightforward plot. It also
puts a very human face onto who is
finally revealed to be behind all the
destruction, which adds a surprising
layer of a smart background story to
the overall plot.
In order to defeat this powerful
antagonist, Hiro is going to need all
the help he can get. And aside from
his older brother’s team of science
geeks who undergo impressive
transformations to superheroes
in their own right, all based on the
various experiments and gadgets
they were each working on initially,
a crucial member of the team
comes from Baymax, an inflatable
healthcare companion, and a project
Tadashi was working on before his
passing.
Being a robot there is a limitation
placed on how closely Baymax
can interact and empathise with
everyone, and a bulk of the film’s
humour comes from the awkward
misunderstandings that take place
in the early process of Baymax
integrating with the rest of the
humans.
When the gang gets together the
film knows just the right kind of
fun to have with these fun, vibrant
characters. The diversity in the use of
colours further injects some much-
needed light-hearted entertainment
and the pace with which the narrative
moves is a healthy one. The film very
rarely slows its pace down, and it
hardly finds the need to do so. There
is an immediate sense of a well-
functioning team, all equipped with
clever skillsets, coming together to do
their part in saving San Fransokyo.
The only weak link comes in
the end. Rather than ending on a
poignant, thought-provoking note,
it chooses to take the easy way out
– admittedly a happier version of
the available options, since there has
been a significant death in the plot
already. But it makes certain aspects
of the film seem less consequential.
But even that cannot stop Big Hero 6
from being an absolute triumph of an
animated feature, a bold, action and
humour-packed ride.

Paul Thomas Anderson
continues his quest to make one
polarising film after another.
His films are designed to challenge,
frustrate and question, and even
the simplest sounding plot can have
the potential to be an overbearing,
incomprehensible chore in the hands
of Anderson. But there is a certain
level of intrigue and fun to be had
in trying to follow and keep up with
everything that is going on in this
over-crowded crime drama that
echoes the great Hollywood neo-
noirs.
Even from the get-go Inherent
Vice has a different feel to it. The
sound and cinematography both feel
outdated, surely a deliberate move
to add that extra touch of an old-
school feel to the film. We start with
a warning and a cry for help. Shasta
(Katherine Waterston) visits her ex-
boyfriend, private investigator Larry
‘Doc’ Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix),
and informs him of a plot to have
wealthy real estate developer Mickey
Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), her current
boyfriend, institutionalised by his
wife Sloane Wolfmann (Serena Scott
Thomas) and her lover whose identity
is not known. Shasta then disappears,
and so the weed-smoking hippie
Doc decides to take a closer look.
He also receives an enquiry from
Tariq (Michael K. Williams), who
requests one of Mickey Wolfmann’s
bodyguards to be tracked down for
an unsettled financial issue. But
that is not all. Hope Harlingen (Jena

is his turn to get down and dirty in
a prison thriller. Set in Australia,
JR (Thwaites) lands himself in jail
for a minor crime. Being the fresh,
new inmate, he must fend off some
unwelcome advances from a group of
men with voracious sexual appetites.
But before things get worse, young
JR catches the attention of Brendan
Lynch (Ewan McGregor), Australia’s
most notorious criminal, who is
supposed to be incarcerated for a lot
longer than JR. But this supposed
friendship and protection come at a
price.
There is a plan in place to break
Lynch out of prison, and a man on
the outside helping him orchestrate
this is crucial. So guess what JR will be
