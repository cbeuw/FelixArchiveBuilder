Osama Awara discusses the challenges behind the high speed transport system
Engineering the Hyperloop prototype
It was in 2012 that the restless
entrepreneur Elon Musk first
announced his idea for a high
speed transport system – the
Hyperloop. Described by the magnate
as ‘a cross between a Concorde, a
railgun and an air hockey-table,’ this
next-generation train system aims
to transport people at speeds of over
700 mph. This would mean a journey
from London to Edinburgh would
take half an hour, faster than a jumbo
jet while at the same time avoiding all
those airport waiting times.
Initially, Musk released his ideas
and plans of the Hyperloop for
other entrepreneurs and engineers
to take up the task of designing and
building this feat. Eighteen months
have passed, and now Musk has
announced on Twitter that he will
build a Hyperloop prototype in Texas.
Clearly he has grown impatient,
which begs the question: how exactly
will this prototype be made?
The Hyperloop being built is for
test purposes only and not an actual
useable transport system. It is to
encourage other companies and
students to come up with the pod
designs themselves. For a second
time, Musk is trying to give people a
piece of the pie.
One of the greatest challenges is
designing the Hyperloop so that it can
reach such high speeds. This means
that the biggest threat to the speed of
any mobile pod or carriage is friction.
Classical train systems experience
high levels of resistance due to the
contact of the train wheels with rail
tracks.
The Hyperloop aims to avoid this
by having the pods floating in the
air by magnetic levitation, similar to
the Shanghai maglev trains in China.
Part of engineering is observing; if
an engineer can create something
new out of existing creations, then
he is a good observer. However,
the difference comes with the
introduction of air bearings.
The air bearings allow the pod to
levitate while at the same time the
pod will force air from the front of
the pod to the rear through holes,
using similar techniques to the well-
known air-hockey game – an existing
creation.
One issue that arises is that when
the capsule is travelling at high
speeds, if its cross-section fills too
much of the tube, the air won’t have
the time or space to travel around the
capsule. This would lead to a build-up
of air at the front of the capsule – an
undesired effect called choked flow.
Choked flow leads to huge amounts
of friction that would prevent the
capsules reaching such high speeds.
A proposed solution to this is to use
an air compressor, which will pump
air from the front through a nozzle
to the rear. This essentially creates
a vacuum space at the front of the
capsule, reducing the pressure in the
tube and hence the resistance.
When objects travel at high speeds,
it is necessary to avoid bends and
inclines in order to ensure that there
are minimal excessive G-forces acting
on the passengers.
Experiencing an excessive G-force
could make the journey a danger to
health, let alone a very uncomfortable
ride. With this, the Hyperloop tube
that connects one city to another
must be kept straight, which for
obvious geographical reasons would
be difficult to achieve. Texas was
chosen to locate the test track for this
reason, as the amount of free space
there is more than anyone can ask for
a Hyperloop test playground.
Careful urban planning would
be required to practically build a
Hyperloop tube linking one city to
another, which may potentially pose
the biggest challenge to a successful
infrastructure.
The test track is certainly one big
step forward to the development
of the Hyperloop. It is up to big
companies, researchers and even
students to bring forward ideas and
build designs of pods to be used in the
rail system of this grand design.
It would be very interesting to see
what proposals are brought forward
and how they would fare against one
another, it is usually the simplest of
designs that fare the best.
