Imperial’s Hidden Artistic Treasures
Every morning, students stream
into Imperial College from
Queen’s Gate, turning in at
Imperial College Road and passing by
a red brick house on their left without
as much as a second glance. Few
students realise that the Victorian
townhouse is both Grade II Listed,
and the residence of the President of
the College.
Completed in 1889, 170 Queen’s
Gate, as it is now known, was acquired
by the college after the Second World
War and subsequently scheduled as
a ‘building of special architectural or
historic interest’ in 1958.
It was designed by the Victorian
architect Richard Norman Shaw,
arguably one of the most influential
and prolific British architects whose
other works include the Romanesque
buildings of the old New Scotland
Yard premises along Embankment
and the old English houses of Bedford
Park; upon closer inspection, one will
notice beautiful carvings above the
entrance, and a family crest on the
front door.
While the upper floors are
designated as Rector’s Lodging,
the ground floor is mainly a venue
for corporate events, receptions,
seminars or weddings. I had the
privilege of exploring its premises
recently and what fascinated me was
the substantial collection of college-
owned art it housed.
In what is known as the Solar Room
(shafts of sunlight streamed gently
into the room while I was visiting),
there is an impressive collection
of Russian paintings on display.
From portraits, to snowy Russian
landscapes, and even to costume
designs, the paintings were originally
loaned to the college by Professor
Alexander Kennaway in 1989 and
variously donated to and purchased
by Imperial College in 2007. Now a
permanent part of the College’s art
collection, they add sophistication
and style to the room, making it look
almost like a small art gallery.
In the adjacent drawing room, a
painting by John Everett Millais
caught my eye – a cofounder of the
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848,
Millais was involved in a movement
that rejected the mechanistic style
of artists such as Raphael and
Michelangelo, instead advocating for
a return to attentive detail, intense
colours, and the influence of nature.
This particular painting, For the
Squire, is a painting on loan to the
college by one of its professors and
shows a girl holding a piece of paper
in her hands, looking up expectantly.
The natural colours and mundane
subject matter is characteristic of
Millais’ late style.
In the largest room, the Council
Room, the walls are adorned with
Sir John Everett Millais, For the Squire, 1882
Jingjie Cheng gets a behind the scenes look at 170 Queen’s Gate
portraits of rectors past and present.
Portraits of past rectors are arranged
chronologically along the walls, from
the second rector Sir Alfred Keogh
who is depicted in full military dress
uniform (he was the Director General
of army medical services prior to
becoming Rector) up to Sir Keith
O’Nions, shown before a montage
of buildings for Imperial West
development.
There is also a painting of Prince
Albert which was presented to
Imperial College by the Queen
in 1957 – besides being closely
associated with the Royal College
of Chemistry and the Royal School
of Mines, Prince Albert was
instrumental in the development of
the South Kensington area as a site for
education in science and the arts.
The house as an historic building
is a concern of our College Archivist
Anne Barrett; she takes care of
the paintings, and has meticulous
knowledge of the treasures
accumulated by the college over the
years. Despite having been here for
more than a year, I had never really
thought about the rich history and
culture that must hide beneath the
glitzy façade of the business school
or the grey, monolithic buildings on
campus. It strikes me as somewhat
ironic that these treasures are
hidden away, seen more by outsiders
renting the venue rather than the
College’s own students, but Ms
Barrett explained that there is a
lack of suitable spaces on campus
to hang valuable works of art or
exhibits in general. Pieces that are
displayed, however, such as those in
the glass cases on the first floor of
the SAF building, seem to go largely
unnoticed by students.
Perhaps a greater appreciation
of the history of the College will
cultivate a stronger collective sense
of belonging and pride to this
institution in which we spend so
much of our time.
Students who are interested are welcome
to arrange a tour of 170 Queen’s Gate
with Ms Barrett.
"It seems
ironic
that these
treasures
are seen
more by
outsiders
than the
college's
own
students."
"I have
never
thought
about
the rich
history
behind
the glitzy
façade."
Editorial: The
Diversity Issue
Following on from our exploration
of hidden art last week,we are
looking at diversity in art and
whether we,as art consumers,are
getting a representative view of art
produced throughout our society.
In our irst article,Jingjie Cheng
visits Imperial College's 170
Queen's Gate,the home of the
university's president and a
popular venue for events.However,
unknown to students,the building
is a veritable treasure trove of
artistic masterpieces.
Next,following a number of
highly publicised comments,
Indira Mallik examines diversity
in art and whether minorities
get fair exposure in the arts,or
whether there exists an elite
club of the privileged few who
seem to run the show.Through
diversity comes richer culture,but
is society becoming stunted by the
stagnation of much of the world's
popular art?
Jingjie visits Somerset House's new
exhibition,MappingtheCity,seeing
how maps can be reinvented to
reveal a different story.Whether
consciously or subconsciously,
we are exposed to maps every
day,however we rarely pause to
consider their artistic value.This
exhibition aims to paint them in
a new light,exploring how they
can be interpreted to tell us more
about the place they represent.
Max Falkenberg lauds Tricycle
Theatre's one woman production
HappyBirthdayWithoutYou,a play
by relatively unknown actress
Sonia Jalaly.It is extraordinarily
dificult for one person,no
matter how experienced,to be
able to command a stage all by
themselves and maintain the
attention of a captive audience,
but Jalay’s character Violet Fox
manages to do just this.
Finally,Dara at the National
Theatre tells the story of a
Mughal prince and his struggle
of succession with his brothers,
on the background of the failing
health of his father.Fred Fyles
sees if this production,originally
performed at the Ajoka Theatre in
Pakistan,heralds a renaissance of
arts from other countries,covering
topics not usually raised in British
art,or if falls short of its intended
goal.
So that’s this week! Next time,
we will be discussing the theme
of new frontiers,exploring how
artists push boundaries or visit far
off places.
