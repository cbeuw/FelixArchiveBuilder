Is buying travel deals on Groupon safe?
Is the price for real? Is this some kind of trap? Is it worth the hassle? This are just some of
the questions we ask ourselves looking at groupon deals Photo: Flickr/ Aikawa Ke
Yung Nam Cheah break down the process of booking so you know what to expect
Write for Travel Felix!
Greetings travellers!
Now that January is almost over,hopefully the blueness
that came with the start of term would pass over a little
as well! However we are still two months away from
Easter,meaning we still got a while to go.
Sometimes you ind yourself sitting there,reminiscing
the good times you had during your break...Why not
turn those into writings and share you experience with
everyone else?
Travel writing is one of the most enjoyable thing you
will ever do.You get to put your feelings and adventures
into words that will induce wanderlust in other people,
giving them tips that you wish you had and inducing
envy with your oh-so-gorgeous photos.
It is also a less gloating way of rubbing your holiday in
your friends and family's face.
To get your started,here are a few pointers on how to be
a good travel writer:
1) Be factual.You will be surprise at how many people
get their facts wrong and run around misleading
everyone.Wikipedia and Google is just a click away,go
ind out if that building is Baroque or Romanesque.
2) Give information.Just saying a museum is wonderful
and runs an exhibit on ancient Egypt is not enough.Put
the opening times,admission fees and website link on.
3) Keep it short and sweet.Don't get carried away and
write a 1000 words essay on Belgium Fries (though I wish
I could)!

"Be
prepared
to pay
extra for
flights... to
make the
most of
your trip."
"With
the right
expectations,
this will
bcome the
new way
to travel.
in comfort
With groupons becoming
more and more universal,
one can virtually buy
anything from clothes to household
appliance to restaurant deals at a
discounted price. However, a lot of
people hesitate in the face of travel
deals.
For those of you less familiar with
the concept, groupon is a platform
for merchants to offer deals to
consumers at a lower than normal
price. A few of the more well-known
brands are Wowcher, Amazonlocal,
Living social and of course, Groupon.
Most of the travel offers massively
discounted flights, as well as
accommodation and breakfast at a
hotel (say goodbye to dodgy hostel
and communal showers!) to a popular
destination such as Berlin and
Budapest.
Some even throw in tours for an
extra ten to twenty quid such as river
cruise, horse riding and even all
inclusive deals.
The price usually hover around
100 to 200 for Europe destinations
depending on the length of stay,
normally from 2 to 5 nights. Deals to
America, South East Asia and other
exotic places are sometimes available
too, starting around 500.
Despite the obvious draw, some
people are afraid of fine print and
hidden charges; and that’s reasonable.
I had many reservations when I first
saw them, and it wasn’t until a friend
taking the plunge that I realized
with the right expectation, this really
will become the new way to travel in
comfort affordably:
1) Read the fine print
This might sound obvious, but
sometimes people get too excited by
the prospect of it and forgot to check.
It should state the period available to
redeem the voucher as well as what
is included and what isn’t. Make sure
you know the refund/ cancelation
policy so you can get your money
back if things go south.
2) Call ahead
Call to inquire the availability or
make sure you are relatively free
during the stated time period.
Sometimes the date you want might
not be available – especially if it’s a
holiday period.
3) Make time for the call
These tour operators often have a
dozen calls coming in at one time.
You need to expect them to take a
while to answer you, as well as having
to call you back to confirm certain
details.
4) Be prepared to pay extra
Most of the time the flights included
in original price is at an ungodly
hour in the morning or late at night
at Luton. So if you want to make the
most of your trip and the groupon,
be prepared to pay around 40 pounds
per person to upgrade to Ryan air or
Easyjet at Gatwick or Standsted. Trust
me, you will save half, if not all of the
money from not having to taxi to the
airport.
5) Check hotel locations
This is especially important for
with multiply hotel offers. Usually
the hotel will be centrally located,
and it might be worthwhile to visit
its website and check its rating on
Tripadvisor. Some deal will offer
a choice of hotel, if you have your
heart set on one of the hotels calling
the travel agent ahead to check its
availability to avoid disappointment.
Beware that some travel agency will
try to give you another hotel - do not
give out your groupon code until you
have the dates and hotel you desire.
6) Hand luggage only
Though this one might be obvious,
but unless you throw in another
extra 30, you will have to adhere to
the hand luggage restriction of the
airline. However don’t worry; most
people are on the same boat
After that, it’s really just printing
out the hotel voucher and checking
in online at the right time. Although
my friend and I experienced a slight
hiccup with check in because the
travel agency booked for us, although
fixing it was as easy as calling them
and they checked in for us and
emailed us the document.
If you don’t like the hassle of calling
the travel agent, and believe me, I
hate calling people at a restricted time
period too, then you should check
out Voyageprive. It’s a luxury travel
website offering 4 to 5 star hotels
and you can forgo the whole calling
process by simply choosing options
online.
