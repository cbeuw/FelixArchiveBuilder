Mapping the City – Cartography Reimagined
Jingjie Cheng explores what Somerset House’s newest exhibition can offer
One Woman’s Triumph of Theatre
MAX FALKENBERG
ARTS WRITER
If self is a location, so is love:
Bearings taken, markings, cardinal
points,
Options, obstinacies, dug heels and
distance,
Here and there and now and then, a
stance.
These words of well-loved poet
Seamus Heaney resonated
in my head as I explored this
new exhibition of street art and
graffiti at Somerset House. Despite
being done in vastly different media
and in all forms of presentation,
one idea united the eclectic
collection – all of them explored
the artists’ relationships with their
surroundings. It was about giving
physical form to experiences and
interactions between man and space
and making sense of the myriad ways
that places shape us.
Take, for example, Martin
Tibabuzo’s Mi Mundo/Meine Welt,
a delicate paper globe on which a
world map had been drawn. If one
looked closely, the map was strangely
inaccurate, and while meticulous, was
unorthodox in style. Tibabuzo had
begun to lose his memory in the early
2000s and was advised to perform
memory exercises. This was one
of the results – he had created this
world map entirely from memory.
This was his personal take on the
world, the world as he remembered
and understood; at the same time,
his own experience of memory loss is
inextricably associated with the art he
created.
It is always interesting when
functional objects are used as a basis
for art – it forces us to look at what
we encounter every day in a new
light, and the results can sometimes
be quite fascinating. Susumu Mukai’s
whimsical fantasy land Regent’s
Canal is based on the walks he used
to take there, but coloured with his
imagination. I saw it as the map of his
mind’s world superimposed onto the
map of his surroundings, rendered
in intricate detail. Along with the
creations he brought to the real
world, he also brought in his cultural
influence – the creatures reminded
me of Japanese folklore.
The small exhibition, which runs
till mid-February, is a collaboration
between Somerset House and
collaborative arts organisation
A(by)P. While there no doubt are
gems to be found in the exhibition,
much of it were artworks one might
walk past without a second glance.
Some reminded me of unfinished
experiments, such as Jurne’s four
pieces which trace some random
shapes on maps of the Bay Area and
Paris, supposedly to show that being
“open to having experiences and
open to unpredictability can lead to
fruition and growth” – I failed to see
the link or anything innovative about
it.
Although the small interconnected
rooms provide a very intimate
exhibition space which seems
appropriate for street art and
graffiti, the sheer number of
artworks crammed in the small
space is somewhat disorienting,
especially since many of them
are large and loud. The riotous
atmosphere, however, did remind me
of the natural home of street art and
graffiti, which might be the point.
Maps and the streets, to me, have
great potential for innovative use
Smart, sexy and absurd. One
woman shows do not get any
better than this. For an hour
of complete hilarity, Violet Fox
recounts her struggles to be an ever
more extraordinary artist for her
exceptionally ordinary audience.
Written and performed by the
unbelievably talented Sonia Jalaly,
The Story of Violet Fox explores the
frayed relationship with her mother
through songs, impersonation and
satire.
A series of crazy, imaginative skits,
Violet Fox’s charming physicality
makes you want to laugh and cry
from start to finish.
If everyone had the commitment,
passion and stage presence of Jalaly,
I’m convinced I would never see
another bad performance in my
life. Jalaly’s ability to impersonate
almost anyone to perfection and sing
with such variation and breadth is
unreal. Okay, maybe not anyone, just
some of the most famous theatrical
female stars in Marilyn Monroe, Judy
Garland, Julie Andrews etc. With
every impression, her performance
just gets better and better. I never
thought I would say this, but this
show made me warm and fuzzy
inside. What more could I possibly
want? With an eye for even the
most subtle cultural observations, a
mixture of audience interaction and
direct participation give the show an
energy so difficult to achieve in one-
man shows.
Like every comedy performance,
even the smallest details have a major
effect on how the audience responds.
Generally, Jalaly has this down to a
T, her actions are so careful and so
well thought out that the majority
of the time her performance blends
perfectly with the story she is telling.
Very occasionally, either the pacing
or the continuation of the story is
somewhat lacking. However, for
a young, unknown actor, she has
exceeded expectations so much that
any criticism really comes as an
afterthought.
Yes, the ending maybe drags on
for thirty seconds too long; yes,
in art, and I was disappointed that
this exhibition did not have more
meaningful ideas. Much of modern
art focuses more on the concept
behind the art rather than the skill of
execution itself, and a lack of artistic
skill can be excused if the idea is
clever. However, much of the artwork
in this show seemed half-hearted, as
if the artists were happy to stop at the
mere representation of space without
exploring further concepts such
as time, identity or displacement.
Is there more to one’s experience
in a city than making colourful
woodblocks of one’s running route?
Or dripping paint around New York
to trace out your own name?
maybe the occasional scene is just too
absurd; but any realistic assessment
of the show can only find these issues
trivial.
With fantastically hilarious scenes
in broken French and mad games of
musical chairs, this show is definitely
the funniest and most carefully
thought out that I have seen this year.
That said, I only got to see this show
after Jalaly had been performing
it for almost a year. In that sort of
time, as is the case with every comedy
performance, sketches can be cut and
new material added to tweak a show
into its perfect state.
Does this diminish her
achievement? Of course not, but other
performers should definitely learn
from her.
"The
funniest
and most
carefully
thought
out show I
have seen
this year."
"Her
charming
physicality
makes you
want to
laugh and
cry from
start to
finish."
If you love energetic, experimental
and raw artworks, you might find the
exhibition a visual feast. But if you
are like me and prefer more polished,
aesthetic works, this is most likely not
for you.
