Talking points from the Australian Open
Is Venus Williams back?
Venus Williams reached the Quarter-
Finals of a Grand Slam for the first
time since the US Open in 2010. She
has struggled since then, and was
diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome,
an auto-immune disease, during the
US Open of 2011.
Nick Kyrgios does it again
The Australian boy wonder, who is
only 19, wowed the home crowd with
his progress at the Australian Open
this year. Kyrgios completed a truly
stunning comeback against Andreas
Seppi to win having been two sets
down in the fourth round. His run
was ended in the Quarter-Finals by
Andy Murray in straight sets, much
to the dismay of the crowd in the Rod
Laver Arena.
Rafael Nadal’s form
It’s been a mixed Australian Open
for Rafael Nadal. He looked very
convincing in his first match against
Mikhail Youzhny, only to need five
sets to get past qualifier Tim Smyczek
in the second round. He seemed to
have got rid of the cobwebs from that
with a couple of emphatic victories,
only to be dumped in equally
emphatic fashion against Tomas
Berdych in the Quarter-Finals. His
Australian Open tally remains at one.
Upsets galore
If there’s anything this edition of the
Australian Open will be remembered
by, it’s the number of upsets that
have occurred. Four of the top eight
seeds in the Women’s Singles failed
to reach the Quarter-Finals, while
only seven of the top 16 reached the
Fourth Round. There were fewer
shocks in the Men’s tournament,
but the most notable one was Roger
Federer. The legend lost in the third
round against Andreas Seppi in four
sets.
Bouchard misses out in a big
match… again
Eugenie Bouchard is fast gaining a
reputation for missing out in the
big games. The young Canadian star
reached the Quarter-Finals before
being comprehensively beaten in
straight sets by Maria Sharapova. In
grand slams, Bouchard has only ever
beaten Angelique Kerber out of the
top ten, and has not come close in
other matches against them. She may
have two semi-finals and a final to
her name, but it could be argued that
she has had fairly open routes to the
latter stages.
Murray back to his best?
Andy Murray has looked very good
at this year’s Australian Open. He
was dominant in his first three
rounds, before dropping a set against
Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth
round. Followers of Murray (and
those who have nothing better to
do than turn British Eurosport
on) will have noticed that his first

determined runners from Imperial
College's very own cross country
and athletics club braved the cold
and travelled to Alexandra Palace
for the irst London College League
race of the term.They were greeted
with ankle deep mud.Before the
race even began,Anna Lawson
returned from her warm up with
knees and hands already covered in
mud.Soon the runners reluctantly
took off their warm layers and
made their way to the start line.The
gun sounded and the race was on! A
mass of students from unis around
London charged off onto the
course,with/without losing their
shoes to the muck.A flat circuit
around the lower park grounds (as
flat as you can get in a mud bath)
was followed by the hill.The Hill,
which Alexandra Palace is infamous
for,will make even your strongest
runners weak at the knees.Once
this had been conquered,it was a
fast and perilously steep downhill
back into the sludge once more.Two
laps for the girls,and three laps for
the guys.A inal sprint (if you could
actually move without your feet
slipping beneath you) and then over
the inish line.
Imperial's very own Sarah Johnson
brought our women's team home
and came an outstanding second
place in the women's race overall.
She was shortly followed by Alex
Mundell (4th),then by Ellie Johnston
(16th) and the rest of the women's
team.The men's race saw Chris
Bannon take a clear win with tactical
surge up the inal hill.He was
followed by great runs from Chris
Thomas (16th),Rupert Hepton (38th)
and the rest of the men's team.IC's
runners achieved great results on
a challenging course,even if they
couldn't see the colour of their shoes
anymore.After the postrace cake
session descended into a mud ight,
with many casualties,the team
trooped on to the nearest spoons
(which wasn't that near) for a well-
deserved calorie binge.With a tough
condition race like that under their
belts,it's safe to say the ICXC are
well and truly prepared for BUCS
XC on the 31st

IC CROSS COUNTRY

Getting down and dirty with Imperial College Cross Country
serve percentages are significantly
improved from last year. This has
been attributed to him going back to
a previous style of serve. His coach
Amelie Mauresmo also seems to be
flourishing now that she is working as
part of a significantly smaller team.
Is Djokovic Unstoppable?
Novak Djokovic is on a very good
run. He hasn’t lost a set throughout
the tournament so far (although that
could change in the semi-final against
Stanislas Wawrinka), and barring
an out of character performance on
Friday will almost certainly be facing
Andy Murray in the final on Sunday
morning.
Madison Keys: Future Star?
Madison Keys is another player for
the future, and she gave a glimpse of
what we can expect in future years
at the tournament. Having defeated
the 29th
seed in the second round, the
unseeded American then dispatched
Petra Kvitova in the third round,
as well as Venus Williams in the
Quarter-Finals. She pushed Serena
Williams all the way in the first set
Kunal Wagle discusses the goings on at Melbourne Park in the World Sport Column
before fading in the second. At only
19, we can certainly expect Keys to be
around for a long time to come.
Another explicit outburst?
After Stanislas Wawrinka’s on court
altercation with Roger Federer’s wife
at the ATP World Tour Finals last
year, there has been more attention
on what people in the player’s boxes
say. On Thursday morning Andy
Murray’s fiancée drew criticism as a
video emerged of her mouthing a lot
of words, a lot of which were allegedly
explicit.
