Students were informed on
Monday that the marks from
an online coursework may be
nullified after reports of “widespread
plagiarism.”
Over 400 students completed the
online coursework for the Business
Economics module, which consisted
of twelve multiple-choice questions,
to be completed within two hours.
Effectively an exam, students were
not formally invigilated; it has
been described as an ‘open book’
coursework that was to be completed
individually and could be done
at home or on campus. Students
completed the online coursework
earlier this month.
The coursework for the Business
Economics module is worth 30%
of the overall module mark. The
course is taken as optional, for credit
course, which is run by the Business
School but is taken by undergraduates
from various degree steams. If taken
for credit, the module is worth a
significant portion of the year’s
overall mark.
An anonymous source informed
the mathematics department that
students had been using a Google
document online to share the
questions from the online coursework
on a Facebook group for students
taking the course.
Questions in the test would appear
in a random order with randomised
multiple choice answers, and people
posted the questions to the Google
document until a complete set of
the questions was available for
participants to view as the session
progressed.
This prompted Professor
Jonathan Mestel, The Mathematics
Department’s Director of
Undergraduate Studies, to send
an email out on Tuesday to maths
undergraduates in third and fourth
year, detailing the alleged plagiarism
and how “it is likely that this part
of the assessment will be nullified.”
The email also asked for those who
may know more about the situation
to come forward, and that they
will be kept informed of any other
developments.
Professor Mestel has also confirmed
to Felix that although they know
what Facebook group it was, it was
not the one used by the mathematics
undergraduates.
The Business School was only made
aware of the allegations of plagiarism
after the email was sent by Professor
Mestel, and are still in discussions
over what to do as a result of these
allegations.
When Felix contacted Jeremy
Fernando, a senior teaching
fellow from the Business School
and the point of contact for these
undergraduate modules, Fernando
said that: “We still need to gather
more information, as we’ve only
heard this third hand. The only
information we have is from Mestel.”
Professor Mestel said to Felix that
they are now waiting on the Business
School, although they take allegations
of plagiarism very seriously. “We are
now waiting to hear what the business
school thinks is appropriate, and it is
likely all departments will be taking
the same action once something is
decided.”
This is not the first time this exam
has faced complications: the online
test was run before Christmas,
but was postponed as Blackboard,
the College’s Virtual Learning
Environment, crashed. The test
was scheduled to start at 18:00, but
within ten minutes students were
complaining of images not loading
and missing formulae and eventually
Blackboard went down completely.
Felix approached the Mathematics
Department Representative, Arjit
Gupta, who told us: “Unfortunately,
I do not know a lot about this issue
yet and am currently investigating.
I am confident that the department
will ensure fairness to all students,
regardless of whether or not they are
taking this course.”
A statement released from the
Business School to Felix said that it is
“formally investigating an allegation
of collusion in an open book online
test for undergraduate students.
“The investigation is still ongoing,
but we are aiming to conclude it as
quickly as possible and any outcomes
will be considered together with the
other relevant academic departments.
“All students assigned the test have

Appointing an Advancement leader
at this level is a common practice
among North American universities;
Imperial is one of the first UK
universities to do so.
Alice Gast, President of Imperial

the Imperial community. We are very
fortunate to have found someone
with Sarah’s experience, talent and
