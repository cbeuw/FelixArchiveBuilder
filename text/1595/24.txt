British author Zadie Smith, whose work has b

the divide between the
have and have-nots, and
Britain’s arts class war
‘Male, Pale,
& Stale?’
Last week, the unlikeliest of
arguments took place. The
participants: the somewhat
passé singer James Blunt and Labour’s
new culture secretary Chris Bryant.
The topic: diversity (or lack thereof)
in the British arts sector. Bryant
sparked the row when, in his first
interview since becoming shadow
culture secretary, he addressed the
“cultural drought” facing Britain
outside of London and the south-east
due to a lack of funding. If elected, he
said, Labour would work to encourage
the arts world to hire from people
from a variety of backgrounds.
Crossed-words might have been
avoided had he not added “I am
delighted that Eddie Redmayne won
[a Golden Globe for best actor for The
Theory of Everything], but we can’t just
have a culture dominated by Eddie
Redmayne and James Blunt and
their ilk,” referencing the actor and
the singer’s privileged backgrounds
– Eddie Redmayne was educated at
Eton and Blunt at Harrow. Blunt
hit back with an open letter to Chris
Bryant, accusing the MP of “telling
working class people that posh people
like me don’t deserve [success], and
that we must redress the balance.”
Blunt went on to say that Bryant was
peddling an “envy-based” agenda
which promoted mediocrity in the
name of diversity above merit. Chris
Bryant replied in a letter of his own
saying “I’m delighted you’ve done
well for yourself… It is far tougher [to
forge a career in the arts] if you come
from a poor family where you have to
hand over your holiday earnings to
help pay the family bills.”
This exchange, at times rather
entertaining (Blunt intermittently
refers to Bryant with choice
phrases such as “classist gimp” and
“wazzock”), has highlighted the
need for open and frank discussion
about the state of the arts in Britain.
Bryant is by no means the only one to
voice his opinions on the subject, in
October, Jenny Sealey, who codirected
the 2012 Paralympic Opening
Ceremony and is now the Graeae
Theatre Company’s artistic director,
stated that unless funding to projects
such as the Access to Work scheme
– which aims to provide funding
to disabled and deaf people to hire
support staff such as sign language
interpreters in order to carry on
working – is maintained, “theatre will
go back to being male, pale and stale”.
Arts funding is where the
boundaries between economics and
culture have really clashed in these
times of ever increasing austerity.
Councils all across England have
seen their arts budgets slashed; in a
particularly dramatic case the council
in Newcastle-upon-Tyne published
a draft three-year budget in 2012,
which projected a cut to funding for
arts organisations of 100% effective
from 2015. This would have meant
the closing of some of the country’s
most respected institutions; The
Northern Stage, one of the top ten
producing theatres in the country;
and Live Theatre, where Lee Hall,
writer of Billy Elliot, learnt his
craft). Though the council has gone
ahead, cutting its cultural budget
completely, effective from April,
the arts in the city were saved by a
last minute intervention from then
Shadow Culture Secretary Harriet
Harman who secured £600,000 a year
(half the original budget) for a new
charitable Culture Investment Fund,
to which arts organisations in the city
can apply for grants.
While institutions can be saved last
minute by politicians, individuals are
rarely so lucky. Cuts in arts funding
has meant a loss of jobs, as well as a
re-evaluation of ambitions for many
young actors, directors, playwrights
and technicians, who find themselves
unable to pursue their craft because
of falling wages. Last year, Academy
award winner and veritable national
treasure Dame Judi Dench lamented
the fact that young actors are being
squeezed out of the profession,
saying “anyone who’s in the theatre
gets letters countless times a week
asking for help to get through drama
school. You can do so much, but
you can’t do an endless thing. It is
very expensive.” Fellow actor David
Morrissey has also spoken out, saying
that the arts is increasingly engaging
in “an intern culture” in which young
graduates are expected to work for
free in order to gain experience
and valuable contacts within the
industry. This was backed up by a
recent report commissioned for Art
Council England into diversity in
the arts, which found that “there are
important diversity issues around
who is able to volunteer including the
use of unpaid internships as a way
to gain experience.” Furthermore,
the National Centre for Social
Research found that higher levels
of volunteering were generally
associated with lower levels of
deprivation, indicating that unpaid
internships are the preserve of the
moneyed classes
David Morrissey went on to say “if
I was starting out now, it would be a
lot harder, because my parents could
never have supported me through
that ‘Is it going to happen?’ period”.
The lack of opportunity to pursue
training in a sustainable way is
partly due to the demise of repertory
theatres due to arts funding cuts.
According to Dame Judi, ‘rep’ theatre
was “where you went to learn and
make your mistakes and watch people
who knew how to do it” .
This is where the arguments
of James Blunt and others, who
think that those with talent will
find a way to succeed no matter
the circumstances, fail. The fact is
that privilege acts on the likelihood
of success in both subtle and sure
ways. No one will deny that the ever
growing ranks of the public school old
boys such as Benedict Cumberbatch,
Eddie Redmayne, Damien Lewis,
Dominic West and yes, even James
Blunt, have had to work hard for their
success; no one is saying that they
got record deals or parts in movies
because their chums from Eton or
Harrow lobbied the big production
companies. But young actors and
musicians and artists from their
background are given the opportunity
to fail, to work for little or no money,
the time to hone their craft safe in the
knowledge that they will not starve.
This opportunity is rarely afforded to
their working class counterparts, who
may have to work 40 hours to make
ends meet and then practice their art
in the evenings.
The tragedy is that the British arts
establishment is going backwards
in terms of representing the society
as a whole as a direct consequence
of the economic downturn. Julie
Walters, who is from a working class
background, recently said that she
worried that “the way things are now,
there aren’t going to be any working
class actors. I look at almost all the
up-and-coming names and they’re
from the posh schools.”
“Don’t get me wrong ... they’re
wonderful”, the actress added, “it’s
just a shame those working-class
kids aren’t coming through. When
I started, 30 years ago, it was the
complete opposite.”
"The fact
is, privilege
acts on the
likelihood
of success in
both subtle
and sure
ways"
"Young
artists from
privileged
backgrouds
are given the
opportunity
to fail"
