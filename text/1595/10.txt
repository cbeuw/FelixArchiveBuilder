Behold, the UK’s inest
collegiate a cappella groups
Last weekend Imperial
College played host to the
vivacious, nerve-wracking,
and outrageously outstanding
International Championship of
Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) UK
Semifinal competition: a massive
undertaking attracting the best
unaccompanied singing groups in the
world.Nine of the UK’s best teams
competed for just one place at the
ICCA Finals in New York, to face off
again against six American groups
and a Wild Card category winner
from anywhere in the world.
Hands free of all instruments
(bar the occasional microphone
at big competitions such as these),
the performers are free to express
themselves through carefully planned
choreography as well as natural body
language where none is in place.A
cappella feels like a contradiction;
we naturally assume that with more
complicated setups and equipment
come better music, so it is a sense of
amazement as well as appreciation
we feel when witnessing these
performances by performers utilising
nothing but their voices to evoke
powerful emotions in the audience.
The origin of a cappella can be
traced back to its use in religious
music, all the way back to the late
15th
century. It is unclear why exactly
the unaccompanied vocal music
became popular, but we can guess
that it was either popularised by
Christian opponents to the use of
instruments in church music or the
lack of instruments themselves. A
cappella seems to have been revived
at the opening of the 20th
century,
starting with the traditional music,
then evolving with styles such as
Barbershop in the 1930s slowly
becoming the kind of performances
we recognise.
I manage to find some performers
before the event started, to find out
their thoughts on the upcoming
competition. “The competition this
year is very, very good,” Sana Mohajer
of the renowned all-male King’s
College London group All the King’s
Men tells me. “The standard is very
high – all the groups know each other
quite well from various national
competitions,” implying of course
that these are the standard high-fliers
who tour the country on a regular
basis.
His group, now in their fifth year,
has won all the London regional
finals of The Voice Festival UK in
addition to the overall competition in
2012 and has previously qualified for
the ICCA Finals twice already, as well
as touring the whole world.
The three Imperial College home
teams could not be more different in
style from one another. The Scopes,
Imperial’s mixed team entrants,
concisely summed up their styles
by comparing the groups to animal
personalities.
“I guess we would be fireflies -
when we were formed (the founding
members are still in the group today)
a few years back ‘Fireflies’ by Owl
City was the first song we covered.
Fireflies suit us as we’re very easy
going and focus on having fun first of
all and don’t worry too much about
winning competitions like these. That
doesn’t mean that we don’t give it our
all, though!
“The Techtonics are Imperial’s
oldest and most well-known group.
An all-male ensemble of scientists
and engineers into electronic music
is definitely unique and interesting,
but considering their personalities...
definitely something canine. No,
wolves would be better to describe
them. But they’re cheeky on their off
days too – cheeky wolves.
“On the other hand, we get the
Imperielles – the sassy all-female
group resident here. This one’s easy –
swans. They’re elegant yet aggressive
when you get too close to them: the
perfect description.”
I ask Beth of the Imperielles what
it’s like to be living out the film Pitch
Perfect. Is the first time in such a big
competition overwhelming, and you
need to suspend your disbelief of the
reality? “On the other hand, I’ve come
to terms with it quite nicely,” is the
reply. “Whenever my friends ask me
what this is, I always start explaining
with “Well, you know the film Pitch
Perfect...”
Speaking to each group is very
easy; all the members have similar
but distinct personalities and keep
a constant stream of playful chatter
going on their way to finding an
answer – it feels like speaking with
one person with multiple voices
rather than a group; that’s how close
they are. I speak to Tammy, again
from the Imperielles, about her
upcoming solo.
“You have to remember that I
haven’t been part of the group for
very long at all,” she tells me. “Less
than a year in fact - and now I’m
about to sing in front of this massive
audience and it would be a bare-faced
lie to say that I’m not nervous at
all.” Tammy went on to receive the
special award for Best Soloist in the
competition.
I didn’t get a chance to speak to
Durham’s entry, The Northern
Lights, but did witness their
impressive performance on stage.
Founded at the end of the 2012/13
academic year, they are Durham’s
first a cappella group – showing just
how much a cappella is exploding
around the country over the last
decade or so.
The biggest group and mixed group
overall, they played it safe with
upbeat pop arrangements. Even so,
the harmony was fantastic to listen
to and the group was relaxed on stage
for their biggest competition yet, and
they took home the award for Best
Vocal Percussion for their beatboxer.
The Trinitones, Ireland’s only
a cappella entry, put on a bolder
performance. Arranging ‘Stacy’s
Mom’ into a choral performance
made the audience chuckle with
delight and making fun of Akon
along with mashing up his songs
was on their agenda too. Just as the
Durham group must have felt, being
the only Irish entry put them under
slightly more pressure than the
others. “It’s not a question of what
people assume – it is a fact that we
are representing the whole of Ireland
here because we are the only Irish
here so it’s extra important that we
give it our all.”
As a cappella expands, however,
places like the North and Ireland will
inevitably see more groups springing
up and thus even more regional
competitions to hone their skills in.
But when management of the group
comes into play, there are bound to
be tensions arising from differences
of opinion, even among the closest
of friends, right? “Absolutely not,”
argues Rob, the president of the
all-male Exeter group Semi-Toned.
“I scream and shout at them all day
but they’re so hardworking and
understanding it’s unbelievable.”
Even for modern a cappella,
Semi-Toned’s arrangements are still
outlandishly brilliant, performing
variations from Kanye West to
Disney and Game of Thrones in the
same routine. Their hard work and
creativity paid off, coming second
overall, and winning the Best
"The
competition
this year is
very, very
good,"
"But they’re
cheeky on
their off
days too
– cheeky
wolves."
