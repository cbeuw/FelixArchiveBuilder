The International
Championship of Collegiate
A Cappella (ICCA) Semi-
Finals took over the Great Hall last
Saturday, seeing three of our own
groups competing and the Techtonics
placing fourth.
Throughout the evening, nine
different student a cappella groups
preformed in the Great Hall, which
was completely packed to the rafters.
Teams had traveled from all over
the country to perform, including
one from St Andrews University in
the north of Scotland and two teams
from Exeter in the south.
Each team had 12 minutes to
perform their set, with many groups
performing three or more songs
whilst on stage, many also doing a
mash-up of songs by various different
artists.
The Techtonics opened the
show, with Ezra Kitson, first year
Biologist, kicking the evening off
as lead vocalist for their first song,
Best of You, made famous by the
Foo Fighters. The Techtonics were
followed by the all-male group from
Trinity College, Dublin, known as the
Trinitones, and the Accidentals, an
all-female group from the University
of St Andrews. The Accidentals came
in third place.
All the King’s Men were next up,
who won last year’s Semi-Finals, and
made it to Boston for the Final in
2014. This all-male group from King’s
College London won Outstanding
Arrangment for their set, alongside
placing first.
After the interval, The Scopes and
the Imperielles, Imperial’s own mixed
and all-female groups respectively,
also performed, with Tammy
Huggins, a second year Biochemist,
later winning Outstanding Soloist.
The Scopes delivered an impressive
mash-up of top 90’s hits, whilst the
Imperielles’ set included exceptional
renditions of Sia’s Chandelier and
a mash up of Massive Attack’s
Teardrop and Lorde’s Royals.
Exeter’s all-male group, Semi-
Toned, delivered a brilliant rendition
of Disney’s I’ll Make a Man Out of You
and won the prize for Outstanding
Choreography for their entire
set, along with placing second.
Meanwhile, Durham University’s
mixed group, the Northern Lights,
won the award for Outstanding Vocal
Percussion for their entire set.
The MC’s for the evening were the
Son of Pitches, a former student a
Great Hall packed as hundreds lock
to see the A Cappella Semi-Finals
Philippa Skett watches as the nine singing troupes take the to stage
cappella group from Birmingham
University. They have since gone
professional after getting to the ICCA
Finals a few years ago.
Whilst the judges deliberated,
they entertained the audience with
a half-hour set of their top hits,
including an improvised song about
a “bobsleighing manatee” in the
style of reggae-opera. Sadly, a second
promised improvisation about
“erotic protractors” was scrapped as
the judges returned to announce the
results.
They did manage to squeeze in a
performance of their latest single
with backings from a gospel choir
known as Sound, which featured
a Techtonics alumni (and Felix
centrefold star), Conrad Godfrey.
The Techtonics spoke to Felix
after the event. Peter Noden, the
President said: “The evening was an
amazing experience for the group,
performing to a home crowd (who
were incredible!) and a chance to
meet up with old friends from other
groups. Afterwards we discovered we
actually placed fourth overall - just
missing out on the top three.
“But the group is not dwelling on
the outcome as we have a very busy
year ahead, with a second studio
album in production and a summer
tour to look forward to!”
The Imperielles also spoke to Felix,
and told us how much fun they had
on the night. “Although the ICCAs
was a competition, the atmosphere
was extremely supportive, and it
felt more like a celebration of the
immense talent within UK a cappella.
“Performing to such a large
audience was really exciting, as
Imperial’s Great Hall was packed
to full capacity. The Imperielles are
particularly proud to have won the
award for Outstanding Soloist which
went to Tammy. Imperielles are soon
to be making a music video, so keep
an eye out for that too!”
The competition, hosted by the
international organisation known as
Varsity Vocals, is now in its 20th
year.
All the King’s Men will be travelling
to New York to compete in the Finals
in April. It is not yet known who they
will be competing against as other
groups have yet to advance from their
Regionals.
Felix spoke to Matt Shirer, the
International Producer of Varsity
Vocals, about the event, and how he
thought it went. Shirer told us how he
was impressed with the high standard
the groups performing, and also just
how smoothly the event went on the
night.
Said Shirer: “Over the years, I have
seen groups elevate their level of
musical excellence and performance
to truly incredible levels, and I
certainly expect we will see that in the
groups competing next year!
“While it took quite a bit of effort,
seeing and hearing the reactions from
everyone at the show easily justified
everything that went into it.”
George Rolls, from All The King’s
Men, said “I would say we are
particularly happy as Saturday night
9 out of 10 men on this stage are currently dating the Felix editor. Ok this is a lie Photo: Xuan
Chen
was the culmination of a few weeks
of particularly hard work. We had
lots of nice comments from alumni
who had performed with us at our 5th
anniversary concert in October. We
would also like to pass our thanks to
the Tectonics, and Henry Harrod,
who did a great job of organising the
event and hosting us all!
“We are starting a fundraising
campaign, as we would love to go
to the finals in New York, but it is a
considerable task to get the money
to go, so we are all expecting to work
very hard over the next 2 months!“
The Scopes said “The Scopes
consider their performance a success
and intend to celebrate by eating a
lot of cake and, in some cases, a lot of
cheese.
“This has been their biggest
performance to date and they are
thrilled to have participated in such a
momentous and spectacular event.”
Planning for the Semi-Final began
in May last year, and has already
begun for Semi-Final in 2016.
