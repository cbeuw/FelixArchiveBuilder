Chanel haute couture spring/summer
2015: the luxe rebirth of the beanie
On Tuesday, Karl Lagerfeld
pushed the boundaries of
haute couture fashion yet
again at the Chanel haute couture
fashion show. The exclusive catwalk
event was held at the Grand Palais in
Paris, with attendees ranging from
the likes of Hollywood starlets like
Kristen Stewart, to French femme
fatales Vanessa Paradis and Charlotte
Gainsbourg.
The event saw the Grand Palais
transformed into a giant tropical
forest of white paper trees, with bursts
of colours from origami flowers and
banana leaves. The show opened with
4 male models dressed in summery
beige shorts and waistcoats, carrying
water cans and proceeding to “water”
the flowers. As the show began, more
flowers opened up from the paper
trees above, conveying a sense of birth
and a new beginning.
The show saw colourful tulle and
chiffon flower details incorporated
in many of the outfits, reflecting a
cohesive underlying floral theme
throughout the collection. The
collection saw a re-vamped version
of the classic Chanel tweed suit, with
long midi length pencil or A-line
tulle skirts, complete with matching
cropped jackets.
Lagerfeld also opted for explosions
of pastel coloured sequins, with one
of the finale looks incorporating
black and pink rosettes on a sequin
embellished midi skirt, with a
matching pink sequin cropped
bustier.
The accessory of choice featured
throughout the show was the hat -
either large brimmed straw styles
enveloped in rich dark coloured
tulles, or beanies embroidered with
sequins and chiffon flowers, some
of them with retro black net veils.
Indeed, Lagerfeld has managed to
re-define the beanie and showcase it
as a luxe couture item. No doubt the
likes of Zara and H&M will be rushing
to re-create the look soon, which is set
to be a staple new look in the fashion
world. Lagerfeld’s creative direction
under the hefty Chanel name make
his designs desirable and oft imitated,
with fashion lovers and retailers alike
displaying a strong urge to channel
his looks. For example, last year’s
haute couture fashion show saw the
emergence of the couture trainers
trend. All of the models wore pastel
coloured trainers with jewelled
accents, sequin embellishments or
lace details. The trend soon became a
huge success, with labels such as Nike
and Uggs attempting to re-create the
luxury sporty look.
In addition to introducing the luxe
beanie, cropped tops and cropped
bolero jackets featured heavily
throughout the show. Lagerfeld even
claimed, “The new cleavage is the
stomach.” It looks like the mid-riff
trend is here to stay for a while.
The overarching floral theme even
saw huge 3-D floral embroideries
at the bottom of coats or across
shoulders on jackets. Lagerfeld called
the show “the flower women of the
21st
century.” Although the theme
of the show was jovial and colourful,
it was conceived with the intention
of appeasing the sombre mood in
Paris as of late. Lagerfeld felt that the
theme was important in light of the
recent terror attacks targeting writers
of the Charlie Hebdo magazine in
Paris. Lagerfeld told interviewers
“especially after this dark, awful
beginning to the year there was
something like this needed...there’s
something about flowers.” Lagerfeld
also remarked that he is lucky to
be sheltered by the fashion world,
adding, “I’m lucky... I live in a very
protected world [in fashion]. I can
keep something like a dream reality
but it’s not a reality of daily life.”
The show truly pushed boundaries
in terms of new trends in the couture
world, including too-long black
patent belts draped all the way the
lengths of the long skirts.
As usual, the finale look of the
show saw a model paraded down the
catwalk in a wedding gown, and this
time she was not heavily pregnant,
as the bridal model was for last year’s
show. The dress’ long trailing skirt
was swathed in white and subtly
pale pink tulle rosettes, giving it a
stiff quality. In contrast, the top of
the dress was a simple white peplum
shape with cap sleeves. The bridal
model was followed by the male
models featured at the beginning of
the show, carrying large bouquets of
colourful roses behind her, a quirky
alternative to traditional flower girls.
The shows of Paris haute couture
week had a decidedly fearless
undercurrent to them. Raf Simons,
the creative director of Dior, made a
link between the spirit of the couture
workers in the ateliers and the proud
protestors on the streets after the
Paris attacks. The underlying message
of the week was simple: vive the Paris
fashion houses and vive la France!
