Overcoming Painful Distance
The world is getting more
globalised and people seem
to end up all over the place,
smattered here and there like dots of
paint. Unfortunately, this also applies
to couples, out of necessity or to chase
after an opportunity elsewhere. Both
sides mean well and they each want
the best for each other, but it’s painful
for a relationship to be reduced to a
window on Skype or a voice over the
phone.
Sometimes, the distance is two
hours away in another town.
Sometimes, it’s on the other side
of the world with a different time
zone. Sometimes it’s temporary, only
as long as a university degree and
you’ll see them every holiday. But
sometimes the end is so far in the
future that you have to accept that
this is the way the relationship is
going to be.
All forms of long distance
relationship (or LDR) are difficult.
But with the connected world of
the internet, distance between two
people will seem closer, evolving into
another kind of relationship that
doesn’t appear as far as before.
I would know. Ever since we’ve
started going out a year and a half
ago, my girlfriend and I have mostly
spent our relationship separated by
a six (sometimes seven) hours time
difference. She’ll either be in England
while I’m in Thailand or vice versa.
The longest we’ve been physically
together was three months, and it
was those moments that made it
definitely worth the wait.
I’m not going to lie; there were a
lot of things we had to adjust to cope
with the separation. So, at the risk of
seeming like an Agony Uncle, here
are some tips that would help you
maintain a healthy long distance
relationship.
Tell each other how you cope
I avoided saying ‘communication’
since this broad term has been used to
death in all relationship advice posts.
What I mean is just talking about
what you prefer or are comfortable
with. You’d be surprised with what
feels ‘natural’ to each person in a long
distance relationship.
Do you like to leave Skype on
whenever you get home so you feel
that you’re always together? Or do
you sometimes try to avoid Skype-ing
because it emphasises how far away
you are from each other, especially
when it’s daytime in one screen and
night in another?
You might think that this
would bring on some awkward
conversations but I feel that
this is valuable in avoiding
misunderstanding or wrong
assumptions. You don’t want to
label each other with something that
they’re not. Skype-ing or texting daily
to keep the warmth alive is not clingy.
At the same time, Skype-ing only
once in a while with the intention of
making every Skype session valuable
does not mean they’re becoming cold.
People have different ways to adjust
to the new situation and it never
hurts to make that clear.
Update each other
The scariest thing about long distance
relationships is how easy it is to drift
apart without even realising it. You
may forget to talk about what you’ve
been up to for days, then weeks, and
before you know it, you have no
idea what you’re each up to. Then
you begin to lose out of each other’s
references and jokes. Suddenly you
notice that someone else began to
understand them better than you.
That’s our secret fear. However,
frequent updates on something so
simple as one another’s days can do
wonders to keep you connected. It
makes the distance seem smaller, as
you’ll be able to relate to what he or
she is doing and vice versa. Next time
you talk will also be much easier since
there’ll always be things to pick up on
other than how much you miss each
other.
Accommodate each other
The two of you will likely have
different lives, meeting new people
in different settings. You’ll be with
different groups of friends doing lots
of stuff at different times. And that’s
not to factor in time difference in
Long distance relationship is a challenge, sure, but you can still go to bed smiling with the phone in your hand.

some cases. It will be much harder to
organize a time to meet since you’ll
both have to be at home in front of a
computer.
But compromises must be made
on both sides to make time for each
other for the reasons in the previous
point.
Share new experiences
No doubt you’ve had lots of amazing
experience with your significant
other while you were together but
you can start new experiences by
beginning a TV series, book, hobby or
even start a new class together.
You will most likely already share
a lot of that already, but when
you’re apart it’s easy to feel like you
can never hang out the same way
anymore. True, you can’t be there
physically, but you can still do things
you’d normally do together, just in
different locations. The best thing?
It would bring back old times and get
you talking the way you would if you
were together.
And this doesn’t all have to be
indoors stuff. What my girlfriend
and I always do when we travel
somewhere new is to create a photo
diary and send it to each other. That
way, it’s almost like you’re seeing
those new things together.
Gestures
Now what these gestures mean
completely on you. Are you the sweet,
dependable or fun type of couple? Do
you prefer old-fashioned letters and
parcels, mysterious flower deliveries
or surprise snapchats? These are
helpful as reminders of those times
you were together.
Looking for ideas? It’s the easiest
thing in the world. I just searched
“long distance relationship” in
Google and almost everything is
relevant. I mean, the first link is a list
of 100 activities couples can do while
apart. There’s even a whole subreddit
where redditors in long distance
relationships share their stories or
give each other advice.
I can’t lie, I know how difficult long
distance relationship is. It’s horrible
to have someone you love confined
to Skype, the screen just within reach
but physically so far away.
But trust me, there are upsides to
it. You will appreciate each other so
much more, as each moment you
spend together becomes so precious
you won’t take it for granted. When
you’ve come to the light at the end
of the tunnel, you’ll both be much
stronger for it and you’ll be glad
you’ve made the trip.
