Science fiction film Ex-Machina
has recently hit cinemas
worldwide, a psychological
thriller to tantalise our over-
active imaginations of a future
where artificial intelligence has a
consciousness. But how far are we
from any of these ideas becoming
reality? In Ex Machina audiences
are supposed to believe that the
artificially intelligent character, Ava,
has a sense of self. Young programmer
Caleb is asked to test Ava’s
consciousness and reveals that Ava
is a bonafide intelligent huminoid
capable of feeling emotions. The
suffering she later experiences in
the film evokes within us a sense of
injustice; if she has a consciousness
surely she should be entitled to
freedom?
Alex Garland, the director of Ex-
Machina, was inspired by Imperial
Professor Murray Shanahan’s
book: “Embodiment and the Inner
Life: Cognition and Consciousness
in the Space of Plausible Minds”.
Shanahan’s research at Imperial looks
into how the human brain function
could be used in the field of artificial
intelligence (AI). “I am interested in
trying to understand how cognition is
realised in the brain. To do this I build
computer models, which are typically
simulations of large numbers of
neurones organised in a complex
network,” he says in an interview at
Imperial. After reading the progress
in theory of consciousness detailed in
Shanahan’s book, Garland contacted
the professor for advice on the
technical aspects of his film.
Origins of Artificial
Intelligence
AI and machine learning
algorithms are surprisingly
ubiquitous in our everyday lives:
Google’s search predictions, mobile
phone voice recognition systems
such as Apple’s Siri, driverless cars
like Tesla Motors’ latest dual-motor
Model S and even closer to home –
number plate recognition technology
used for the London congestion
charge. However, we are still a long
way off being able to use robots
instead of all-nighters to desperately
complete our university coursework.
The progression of AI from the
pages of Isaac Asimov’s science
fiction stories to driverless cars
all started in the 1950s with Alan
Turing, a British mathematician and
infamous WWII codebreaker. It was
Turing who first posed the question
of whether machines could think,
developing the Turing test, which
determines how close a machine’s
behaviour is to that of a human. It is
this that forms the basis for the plot
of the film Ex-Machina.
Through the 1960s and 1970s
Marvin Minsky, an American
cognitive scientist, became a leading
thinker in the field and co-founded
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) shortly after
Turing died in 1954. Similar to
Professor Shanahan, Minsky was
scientific advisor to director Stanley
Kubrick on the 1968 science fiction
film “2001: A Space Odyssey”
which brought audiences the AI
called HAL9000 aboard spacecraft
Discovery One.
After what was termed an “AI
winter” between the 1970s and
1990s, when funding was cut short
as governments favoured more
productive industries, the 21st
century saw the advancement of AI
technology, albeit in less obvious
ways than human lookalike robots.
Nowadays, AI research is focused
more on behind the scene uses such
as logistics, data mining and medical
diagnosis. One crazy example is
in Japan where an AI has been
nominated as a board member in a
venture capital firm as it can predict
market trends faster than its human
associates. AI is also being used in
the defence industry, with South
Korean forces now using Samsung
SGR-1 armed sentry robots to patrol
the boarder with North Korea, and in
Iraq and Afghanistan.
There have also been advances in
robots that can develop and show
emotions. Nao, a robot developed
by the French robotics company
Aldebaran, is being used as a robotic
teacher in universities and schools
across the UK. The uncannily human-
looking robot stands two feet tall and
can be programmed to listen, see,
speak, touch and react. If you search
‘Nao robot’ on YouTube you can
even see troops of them programmed
to dance in sync with the pop-hit
Gangnam Style. Their abilities extend
far beyond the dancefloor however,
and they can even form bonds with
the people they meet – depending on
how they are treated. The longer they
interact with someone, the more Nao
learns the person’s moods and the
stronger the bond becomes.
Growing concerns
The usefulness of these
technologies, with their capacity
to continually learn from the data
they collect, is making it ever harder
to imagine a future without AI.
Increasing dependence on these
machines has sparked some concerns,
with even Stephen Hawking warning
of the perils of AI, saying in an
interview with the Independent:
“The development of full artificial
intelligence could spell the end of
the human race ... humans, who are
limited by slow biological evolution,
couldn’t compete, and would be
superseded.” The technological
singularity hypothesis represents this
view that continued progress in the
development of AI will ultimately
cause the end of humanity as its
power exceeds mankind’s intellectual
capacity to control.
If you follow popular culture ss a
guide to AI, then we really should be
terrified. Most fictitious depictions
of a future where humans and robots
co-exist picture bleak apocalyptic
scenarios, ranging from robotic
conspiracies to take over the world
in I-Robot to the dystopian Earth
depicted in the film Blade Runner
where robotic ‘replicants’ have
spiralled out of human control.
Whatever your stance on the future
of AI, its progress since the 1950s has
showcased the incredible capacity of
humanity’s own intelligence. It has
certainly helped advance sectors such
as medicine, defence and business.
But how long it will take to create
robots that have consciousness is still
debated. Shanahan comments on
the topic saying “the Robotics side of
things – Ava’s body – we can get to
in 10 or 15 years I think ... but Ava’s
consciousness requires a couple of
conceptual breakthroughs before
we get there”. Therefore despite
substantial progress we are still far
from making the ideas portrayed in
Garland’s film a reality, though it’s
certainly not impossible.
