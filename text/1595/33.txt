Outrage as students
fail to cheat on open
book, online exam
Sources from inside a local
London polytechnic have
revealed to Hangman they are
“shocked and saddened” that an open
book, online test, taken by students
in the comfort of their own home
and without any invigilation, was not
plagiarised.
Instead it is thought that students
diligently sat down, turned off their
internet and phone and took the
exam within the allotted time, with
most, if not all, studying beforehand.
The module, An introduction to
Economical Management Studies,
is offered to all students at the
polytechnic, and the online test
makes up 95% of the overall module
mark. The other 5% is awarded if
students fill in their name correctly at
the beginning of the test.
Hangman has been told that this
behaviour has been condemned as
“stupid,” “idiotic,” and “completely
unexpected considering the nature of
the test.”
Said one course convenor from the
social studies department: “We ran
this hoping the students would band
together, share the results and all
come out with full marks.
“Instead it seems they all managed
to scrape a 2.2 honestly and fairly. I
can only imagine what impact this
may have on our league ratings. Can
universities be relegated?”
The exam, taken by approximately
400 students from various
humanities courses including media
management, golf management,
managing management and also
biology, was set online, and featured
five multiple choice questions that
they had five hours to complete.
The questions covered topics
including pocket money
management, how to apply for job
seekers allowance and the perceived
monetary worth of Kim Kardashian.
Hangman spoke to a second year
travel and tourism student, who took
the exam on Monday. We met him

Terror at
A Cappella
concert due to
spontaneous
ovary explosion
Tragedy unfolded on Saturday
as what started as a joyous
celebration of A Cappella
ended in a bloodbath, where no one
could have possibly anticipated the
effects of bringing attractive boys to
Imperial.
The preliminary signs that
suggested there was trouble within
the audience became apparent as
the Trinitones began their set. The
Irish lads, hailing from Trinity
College, put on a 12 minute set that
included a disturbing amount of hip
thrusting, which, according to the
judges, was just below the threshold
of the maximum amount of thrusts
allowed in a competitive A Cappella
competition.
There were signs that the thrusting
had increased the agitation within
the audience; however, it was not
until All the King’s Men from Kings
College arrived on stage did the
organisers realize the gravity of the
mistake they had made.
Unbeknownst to many of the
show’s producers, there is a scientific
phenomenon where a hormone
named ‘techtonictestosterone’ is
produced exclusively in desperate
single women when the harmonic
resonance of an all-male A Cappella
choir hits a D Maj-7 chord.
This hormone then causes a
biological ovary implosion leading to
70% aca-fatality rate and as you can
imagine, the results were horrendous:
eight ambulances had to be called to
the Great Hall only one minute into
the Techtonics opening song, sang
by fresh faced Kizra Etson, a first
year emo (ecology, microbiology and
ornithology) student.
Another twelve paramedics were
dispatched during the hair-flipping
heavy set of Semi-Toned, an all male
group from Exeter. An impromptu
medical tent was sent up on the
Sherfield walkway distributing dry
knickers, hand fans and photos of
Noel Edmunds for women to look at
to calm down.
The producer of the show, told
Hangman: “Usually we expect one or
two members of the audience to die
from the high levels of campness, but
nothing on this scale.”
One student who did not enjoy
the show was the Deputy President
(Heterosexual) Kris Caye, who spent
most of the night on Tinder. He did
perk up when the all-female team
from University of St. Andrews took
to the stage, although was unable to
focus on the set as was responsible
for mopping up under the seat of the
Felix Editor. Caye said to Hangman
afterwards: “It was exhausting,
although if I didn’t stem the flow
people in the back rows may have
been literally washed away.”
in a local coffee shop, where he was
skimming through his photos from
his recent trip to the Phi Phi Islands.
“Yeah, it’s just that, we have a lot
of time to study and not really any
pressure to like, you know, do well. I
don’t have any grand, high pressure
grad schemes lined up, so why would I
be tempted to cheat, you know?”
Hangman spoke to another student,
this time a third year reading General
Studies. She told us: “As I only have
four contact hours a week, and you
know, no crippling international
student fees to deal with, I thought,
why bother taking advantage of a
completely flawed, opened ended
system, one that was just waiting to be
milked for all it was worth?
“I don’t mind getting a 2.2, I
actually enjoy university, have a great
social life and don’t even bother going
to the library.
“Even if I leave with no job, the
amazing experience I would have had
will be worth it.”
