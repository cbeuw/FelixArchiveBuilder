hardship
Recent survey results have
shown that students in their
final years of medicine face
extreme financial difficulty, with
one in two students saying that their
financial situation might affect their
ability to complete their degree.
A shocking 87% of students in their
fifth and sixth year of medicine said
they have financial concerns, and
50% of the respondents also said that
the pressure may affect their physical
or mental health. Only 3% of students
are able to cover all their outgoings
with the financial aid available, with
those surveyed facing an average
deficit of £141 a week that is covered
by parental support or part time jobs.
Students in their clinical years (the
final two years of their degree) see
their maintenance loan from Student
Finance slashed, and, despite being
eligible for a NHS bursary, students
are still struggling to make ends meet.
From the students surveyed,
students are receiving on average
around £2,000 from the NHS Bursary
and another £2,000 from Student
Finance each year, amounting
to roughly £98 a week. However
students are also seeing annual
outgoings amounting to roughly
£12,000 – putting many students
seriously in the red.
The survey, run by Imperial College
School of Medicine Student Union
(ICSMSU), asked current students
about their incomes and outgoings,
and how they were coping with their
finances. Over 100 students from
the current fifth and sixth year of
medicine responded. The survey was
promoted in all-student emails, on
various ICSMSU Facebook pages and
on twitter.
Using the data from those who
responded, students in these years
are paying on average £141 a week
on rent, £25 on travel, £40 on food
and are spending around £33 on
everything else.
However, fifth and sixth year
students do not get as much financial
aid as the lower years, leading to a
greater deficit and more stress as a
result. Matched with the academic
demand of these clinical years, the
lack of summer holiday available to
work full time to save money, and the
intense timetable that leaves little
room for part time work, students are
struggling more than ever.
Final years also have to arrange and
undertake an Elective: a compulsory
element of their degree, which often
requires travelling abroad.
One respondent said: “Working
at two part time jobs leaves me with
little time to study. I manage to pass
my exams each year but I don’t have
the opportunity to put enough time
into my studies to do any better.
“Two years ago I was diagnosed with
depression and I believe a lot of it was
to do with financial difficulties.”
Another said: “Constantly being
worried about making ends meet
is exhausting: I’m sick and tired of
always thinking about it. Currently I
tutor six times a week, but as a fifth
year this is unacceptable and leaves
me with little or no time to study
myself... Even despite this, I am still
constantly in the red.”
47% of students who responded to
the survey have a part time job, work
roughly nine hours a week and earn
on average £12 an hour. However
only 18% of students manage to
remain in the black when balancing
income, including bursaries, loans
and wages and outgoings.
Said another respondent: “I am
currently only able to continue
with my studies thanks to savings I
accrued from previous employment
before and during the earlier years of
medical school.
“Continuing with fifth year was
only possible financially in thanks to
a large extension of my overdraft, to
around £2,000.”
Students currently in their clinical
years, which are the final two years of
medicine for Imperial students, aren’t
eligible for a maintenance grant
from Student Finance, and their
maintenance loan is also significantly
reduced too. Instead, they receive an
NHS means tested bursary, which
they do not have to pay back.
The maximum students can
therefore claim in loans and bursary
funding is £9,131 for those in fifth
year, and £8,366 for sixth year
students.
The NHS also pays their tuition fees
for these final two years.
However, when comparing the
survey results to Imperial’s own
estimations for the cost of living,
92% of these medical students do
not receive enough money through
financial aid and part time work to
cover Imperial’s predicted living cost.
Imperial estimates that students
should expect to pay around £291
a week to cover rent, travel, leisure,
academic-related and food costs.
The weekly outgoing of the students
surveyed was significantly lower than
this: students are managing to live on
an average of £237 a week (including
rent), with many struggling to stay
afloat.
An overview of the NHS bursary
provision took place in 2012 when
the tuition fees increased, although
current fifth and sixth year students
are still subject to the terms and
conditions of the previous 2007
Scheme.
Those that started in 2012 or later
may fare considerably better due to
the introduction of a £1,000 grant
that for which everyone, regardless
of household income, is eligible.
However, the maximum bursary
students can receive will reduce by
about £300.
The government loan also decreases
further between the fifth and sixth
year; current fifth year students will
see the maximum loan available
decrease by approximately £250
when they move into their final year
this summer.
Most students have to turn to
their parents for financial support
to make up their financial shortfall.
However, many students who replied
to the survey also said they were
uncomfortable doing this, or their
parents were struggling to make ends
meet too. Around 1 in 3 of those who
responded said their parents were
unwilling or unable to offer any sort
of financial support.
Said one respondent: “I am
completely reliable on my parents,
who have other children to pay for
and other expenses to worry about.
I feel guilty about the increasing
amount they need to provide for me.
“The loans available are incredibly
low in a time where we pay for
accommodation throughout the year,
travel more/further and have an
elective to organise.”
Said another: “My finances are a
constant worry, to the extent that
I very nearly took steps to take
sabbatical years to save money by
working full time on two occasions.
I resent that I have become more of
a burden on my parents as I have got
older.”
It is not just the parents of medical
students too who are struggling to
cover the cost of their children’s
education; a recent national survey
ran by Experian, a global service
information group, found that 1 in
10 students’ parents are borrowing
or using credit cards to cover their
children’s living expenses.
9% of the students who responded
have already applied to the Faculty
of Medicine’s own hardship fund for
this academic year. Medical students
can also apply to the College’s central
student support fund too if needed.
