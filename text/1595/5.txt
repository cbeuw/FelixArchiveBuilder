had already allocated over £25,000
from its own hardship fund to
students in the past six months,
typically allocating between £500 and
£1000 depending on the needs of the
student.
Said Schachter: “Since the summer,
when year 5 and 6 of the medical
course start, I have seen a massive
increase in the number of students
asking to see me because of severe
financial difficulties, 300-400% more
than the year before.
“This was totally unexpected but is
clearly linked to the fact that the NHS
bursaries are significantly less than
students had received in the first 4
years of the course, but also less than
most students had been anticipating:
this is most apparent in fact from the
transition from year 5 to 6.
“The sort of immediate problems
I have been told about include not
having money for the next month’s
rent, having about £100 after rent
for 3 months food and everything
else, and working 30 hours a week in
addition to a very intensive course
effectively to survive.
“The really alarming thing is that
even this worrying situation is likely
to be an underestimate of the actual
problem. Clearly unless something
is done the same situation is likely to
recur next year too.
“The School is working urgently
Just what
funding is
available
for clinical
students?
NHS student bursaries are
available to students on pre-
registration health professional
training courses,which include
students in their ifth or sixth
year of studying medicine.A fees-
only bursary from the NHS covers
tuition fees,and these are paid
directly to the university,much
like Student Finance pay for any
other home or EU undergradu-
ate's tuition fees.Students do
not have to pay this back.The
NHS also has an“extra weeks”
allowance,that provides £107 per
week when academic years are
longer than 30 weeks (excluding
holidays).
For living costs,the government
maintenance loan available for
current ifth year students is
£3,263,and for inal year students
is £2,498.This isn't means tested.
There is also an additional bur-
sary available that is allocated to
students based on the income of
their family home.Students in
both years can claim up to £5,868.
Medical students in their clinical
years are not eligible for Impe-
rial's own bursary scheme,which
is described on the Imperial web-
site as“One of the most generous
of all UK Universities.”
Imperial has recently altered its
bursary scheme for the 2015 aca-
demic intake,although not with-
out controversy.After announc-
ing the initial plans to award
more money to students from
higher income households,at the
expense of those who come from
households that have less money,
Imperial College Union Council
denounced the alterations as
“Anti-Robin Hood.”
Despite this outcry,students
starting Imperial in 2015 from
low-income families are still eli-
gible to receive £6,000 in bursary
alone for the irst four years of
their degree.When factoring in
maintenance loans and grants,
the maximum amount of money
students could receive exceeds
£15,000,despite Imperial also
stating that undergraduates
should expect to live off £11,223
(for a 39-week long academic
year).
The maximum students can
therefore claim in loans and bur-
sary funding is £9,131 for those
in ifth year,and £8,366 for sixth
year students.
with the College and ICMSU and ICU
to avoid this or at least minimise its
impact.”
The results of the survey were
collected and analysed by Jennifer
Watson, a fifth year medical student
herself, and the current ICSMSU
Welfare Officer.
Jennifer told Felix why she set the
survey up in the first place: “I started
looking into the situation after
several of the welfare cases that came
forward during the summer were
related to financial worries.
“I was basically shocked by what I
found. I admit, when I read through
all the results, I cried a little going
through the free text responses.”
ICSMSU President, Dariush
Hassanzadeh-Baboli, spoke to Felix
about how the survey’s findings may
resonate with all medical students,
not just those at Imperial. Said
Dariush: “Jennie has put in a huge
amount of effort into gathering this
information. Clearly it is a big issue
not only for ICSM students, but
medical students nationwide.
“The lack of funding in the final
two years of med school is very
concerning, particularly as the work
load increases dramatically and time
to earn some extra cash dwindles
significantly.
“We hope to see some rapid changes
in the very near future.”
