Unfortunately, this should come as
no surprise. In 2012, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) reported that
the UK has some of the lowest social
mobility in the developed world. It
found that social mobility in Britain
hadn’t changed since the 1970s and
in some respects had gotten worse.
Walter’s words were echoed by Call
the Midwife actor Stephen McGann.
“Sometimes today it feels like we’re
going the other way. Opportunities
are closing down. If you’re a messy
kid from a council estate today, I
think the chances of you making it as
a successful actor are a lot worse than
they were.”
Those in leadership positions
within the arts sector share such
concerns, with Dominic Dromgoole,
artistic director of Shakespeare’s
Globe Theatre, saying that the
“thinning of the social spectrum is a
real concern”.
The question is: should we care?
The answer, emphatically, is yes.
This economic exclusion of the
poorer sections of society leads to
an exclusion of ethnic minorities,
who are more likely to come from
a lower socioeconomic group. With
recent census data showing that
British society is becoming more
diverse than ever before, it seems
odd that the arts, which are meant
to reflect society, should go in the
opposite direction. Crucially, cutting
out of such a significant portion of
our society from the arts not only
does a disservice to the young artists
and performers seeking to join the
sector, but us, the consumers of
culture as well. How can we get a
variety of voices when there is only
one group in the room? Do we really
want to engage with a culture that is
increasingly ‘male, pale, and stale’?
"Do we really
want to have
a culture
that is
increasingly
male, pale,
and stale?"
For many of us, the answer is no,
and this is echoed by the statistics.
In 2013, Arts Council England
(ACE) commissioned a report into
“equality and diversity within the
arts and cultural sector in England”.
It found that the percentage of people
engaging with the arts (including
museums, theatres, galleries and
public libraries) at least once a year
was just 67.3% for those from a lower
socioeconomic group, in contrast
over 85% of those from a higher
socioeconomic group engaged with
the arts. The report also showed
that with respect to audiences
and participation in the arts the
gap between Black and minority
ethnic people and white people has
widened. Research suggests that one
most common reasons that Black
and minority ethnic people fail to
engage is because of concerns about
feeling uncomfortable or out of place.
Alienation of minority communities
only contributes towards deepening
of divisions within society, and
disengagement with the arts can have
significant impact on the rounded
development of children, as well as
their subsequent success in all areas
of endeavour, including gaining
admission into top universities.
In December 2014, Sir Peter
Balzalgette gave what he termed
“one of the most important speeches
in his capacity as chairman of Arts
Council England”, announcing
a “fundamental shift” in the
organisation’s approach to increasing
diversity in the arts world. In his
galvanizing speech, he spoke of
how much of British culture has
been shaped by “those who once
stood outside – who have come to
Britain from other countries, or
those whose perspective and voices
have not always been included in
the mainstream.” He went on to cite
artists who have categorically defied
the ‘male, pale, and stale’ stereotype,
including Zadie Smith, whose novel
"Alienation
of minorities
only
contributes
towards
deepening
divides in
society"
White Teeth he said ‘[best] described
our society on the cusp of the new
millennium’, Steve McQueen, the
Turner prize-winning artist whose
film Twelve Years a Slave was the
first film produced and directed by
a black filmmaker to win an Oscar
for best picture, and Paul Cummins,
the disabled artist who created the
“extraordinary, elegiac display of
ceramic poppies around the Tower
of London”. He went to say that the
arts world was not “reacting fast
enough to changes in society” and
needed to reflect immigration as
well as the invisible parts of society
– the disabled and the elderly,
saying “all need to be brought to the
conversation”.
His solution to the problem is the
‘Creative Case for Diversity’, a new
tougher enforcement of the Equality
Actions Plan that legislates for
diversity. He said that ACE would
be publishing “workforce diversity
data for individual national portfolio
organisations and major partner
museums” from 2015 and threatened
that unless the ACE-funded
organisations make progress with
“the diversity of their programmes,
their audiences, their artist and their
workforce” that there would be “a
reckoning”. In short, their funding
would be axed, and the organisations
removed from ACE memberships
from 2018.
It remains to be seen whether
funding cuts (or at least threats of
such) can tackle a problem partially
created by funding cuts, but from
this year big changes are expected
to take place. Balzalgette ended by
saying “young talent, whatever its
background or class will see the kind
of work that convinces them that
the arts belong to them -and that
they have a way in. We can’t give
people creative talent. But we can and
must give those with talent creative
opportunities.” This sentiment at
least, we should all be able to agree on.
