This is tomorrow night in the Union
Building with two discos, a band,
films and a bar extension until
m i d n i g h t . People will not be
admitted purely to use the bar
extension and will be charged entry
right up to the finish. This goes for
the Ents gigs on Friday nights as
well. Don't bother turning up half
an hour before the end, you'll still
pav as much as if you'd seen the
band. When the fire capacity has
been reached, no new entries will be
allowed.
R C A Surcharges
Some students complained that the
R C A was charging a 25p surcharge
on food for non-RCA students. 1
have spoken to someone from their
Exec who said that he would consult
and get back to me. He appreciated
the comment that such a surcharge
was not in the ' spirit' of our
reciprocal agreement with them.
Card Check
I apologise for any inconvenience
caused during the Union card check
over last weekend. A number of
people got annoyed about being
troubled, particularly those who
have seen little need for a Union
card and opted not to get one. Beit
residents have certain grounds for
complaint as they were checked
before going into their residences
although 1 hope they understand
that it was for their security as much
as the Union's.

I have recently received a letter from
the Hilda Martindale Educational
Trust announcing their exhibitions
for vocational training. 'The Hilda
Martindale Educational Trust was
established through the generosity
of the last Miss Hilda Martindale
CBE (1875-1952), with the object of
helping girls and women of the
British Isles whose intention it is to
fit themselves for some profession
or career likely to be of use or value
to the community, and for which
vocational training is required.'
Exhibitions are n o t n o r m a l l y
awarded to those who are eligible
for grant-aid from other public
sources.
If anyone is interested i n
applving, please contact me (via the
U n i o n Office or M e c h E n g
pigeonholes) as soon as possible as
application forms must be obtained
and returned by March 1. By the
way, applications must be
accompanied by a recommendation
from the Head of Department.
