Rising Thermals
This Christmas, the Imperial College Gliding Club shook off the winter
blues with their flying holiday in the Shropshire hills. Home of the
Midlands Gliding Club, the Long Mynd Hill site often provides the best
of this country's winter soaring conditions and pilots from all over the
country go there during their New Year breaks.
W e towed two single-seat aircraft
and one two seater off to Shropshire
and u p the perilous hill itself.
Students and ex-students made
their way by road or by train,
converging on the small town of
Church Stretton. Despite getting
one glider trailer completely stuck
and needing two cars to rescue it,
we ended up at the top of a bleak,
windswept ridge hilf, our home for
the next week.
A m o n g the novices of our group,
I had come for a taste of flying away
from our home site at Lasham in
Hampshire. A s I was to find out,
flying on a small, windy hill is very
different from the huge airfield to
which I was accustomed. Since mid-
October I have been learning to fly
with the Imperial College Gliding
on each glider. Gliders are usually
launched by one of two methods;
w i n c h i n g a n d , less often,
aerotouring. Aerotouring involves
being towed behind a powered light
aircraft. The cheaper alternative is
to attach the glider to a very
powerful winch o n the ground,
some distance away from the launch
point. The strong cable is drawn
very quickly by the winch. This high
speed, up to sixty knots, allows the
glider to climb very rapidly to a
height of about fourteen hundred
feet. W h e n the glider gets near to
the position of the winch, the cable
is released and it is free to fly away.
The Midlands Gliding Club have a
second winch back at the launch
point which draws the main cable
back for the next glider. This lighter
a glider
Club. A t the moment I must fly with
an instructor. For those of us in this
position, the Club had hired a
w o o d e n two-seater glider i n
addition to the usual two glass fibre
gliders.
There is a sense of urgency as
gliders are wheeled out of the tightly
packed hangar o n little trolleys.
Pilots are eager for the chance to fly
a n d gliders must be carefully
inspected and then pushed out to
the launch point to join the queue.
Since very few people can afford
a glider and gliders are quite heavy
to move around and launch, there
are several people waiting for a turn
cable is attached to the end of the
main cable so that there need be no
delay after the glider has released.
The reason for the Long M y n d ' s
popularity among glider pilots is
simple. When the wind blows in the
right direction it is forced to flow
over the long ridge hill and this
produces a long band of rising air
on the windward side. Apart from
the launch a glider or sailplane has
only one source of energy: rising air.
Although a glider must always sink
through its surrounding air in order
to fly, if that surrounding air rises
fast enough the glider will actually
climb. Soaring flight involves;
By Nicholas Merriam
staying aloft for a prolonged period
of time by using this lift, either to
avoid descent or to recover height
lost flyng in still or sinking air.
Unfortunately, this means that the
Long M y n d is at its best only when
the wind is strong and coming from
the right direction. One one day I
did get an extended flight, having
found rising air caused by nothing
apparent.
The flight was preceded, as
always, by a series of control checks
and strapping myself in well. Then
came the rocket-like acceleration as
the winch powered us forwards,
and the steep climb to get as much
height as possible. In moments the
launch was over, the cable released
and we were free. M y instructor had
pointed out that a number of gliders
had been accumulating in one area
and seemed to be staying up there,
so we set off to join them.
The rising air was limited in area
and since it is not possible to simply
stop in it we circled. One of the arts
of soaring is to be able to find a circle
within an invisible column of air.
Our indicator is the position of
gliders already circling. Careful and
precise flying is required when near
other gliders in this situation. You
must be careful to keep a close eye
on the other gliders around you and
you must fly an even, accurate circle
to make the most of the lift. Poor
flying in this respect causes your
circle to drift out of the area of lift
and to slip d o w n faster than is
necessary.
This is when all the hard work on
the g r o u n d s u d d e n l y seems
worthwhile, gently drifting, bird-
like, across the countryside. This
area of Shropshire is particularly
scenic and, gazing d o w n at the
tranquil valleys, there is suddenly
nowhere you would rather be.
At several thousand feet above the
valley floor, fields become
patchwork decorations with toy
houses and miniature roads. Y o u
even feel at one with yourself, in
harmony with nature, as you float
by effortlessly.
From the air, the landing area had
looked like a picnic blanket but
suddenly it seemed large as w e
pushed the glider back to the launch
queue.
A l l in all, I thoroughly enjoyed
myself and I have got my name
down for next year.
If you would like to join us, come
along to a Gliding Club meeting one
Thursday afternoon. We meet at
5.30pm in Aero 254.
WALTER
WALTER
The day of St Valentine has come
and gone, and on top of that we are
now busy recovering from that
other major event in the Christian
calendar. A l l those w h o
immediately thought Walter was
referring to the budget, go and
stand in the nearest corner. He was,
and is, referring to Shrove Tuesday.
The original derivation of Shrove
Tuesday was the desire of Christians
to use up all their remaining scraps
of food, i n order to prevent it
becoming a festering pile during the
fasting time of Lent. This has been
submerged in the modern desire to
lay in mighty stocks of lemon and
honey, prior to the manufacture of
pancakes; a noble task.
You might gather from that last
comment that Walter is a
considerable devotee of pancakes,
and he is put in mind at this point
of a physicist friend who desired to
prove that it was impossible for a
standard composition pancake to
stick to the ceiling. The experiment
was conducted in impeccable style:
Make pancake, propel upwards
from pan, observe result. This
technique proved to have one fatal
flaw, which was that in order to
observe, o n e h a s to stand
underneath, so to speak; a risky
procedure, and all the more so in
the light of the eventual findings of
the said physicist, which may be
summarised in the ancient phrase,
'What goes up, must come d o w n . '
Physicists are a remarkable lot,
indeed. Walter is no physical
scientist, preferring to stand pat
w i t h those w h o study social
systems; he therefore tends to have
a difficult time understanding the
finer points of, for example, the
branch of physics which he feels
would be best named 'Jolly Small
Particles and Things'. This is not
made any easier by the way i n
which our Physical brethren insist
on naming their particles. Quark,
Charm and Superstring are names
which spring to mind. It would be
churlish to speculate that the
reasoning behind these names is
that they are easy to spell.
Anotner set ot things which are
for once easy to spell, is the list of
this year's sabbatical candidates.
N o w that the papers have gone up,
Walter is obliged to refrain from
mentioning any of those names, but
candidates need not think that they
have escaped scrutiny altogether;
once the whole shouting match is
over, the full story may be published
in full.
