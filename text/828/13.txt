A win at last
R S M - 0
IC II—2
After three defeats, IC desperately
needed a w i n to keep sight of the
league title. In a traditionally
physical game R S M opened well, at
least for the first ten minutes, IC
then began to play, with debutant
John West controlling the mid-field,
Julian Fordham's penetrating runs
and the ever tricky A d a m Thomas
helped IC gain control and before
long Mickey Plummer scored his
fourth goal from 25 yards, in three
games to give IC the breakthrough.
1-0 it was at half-time, and captain
Jezz Holland, playing in borrowed
boots, was as happy as pie. But as
the saying goes, it's not all over until
the fat lady sings, and Simon
Holden h a d barely cleared his
throat! Mines started the second half
well, but just lacked the ideas as
Ivan Parkin and Bill Leonard cleared
up at the back. IC o n the attack
again, and Gary Mahoney came
close before John West played a
beautiful through ball to Rakesh
Muthoo, who calmly slotted home
from 10 yards. After that it was plain
sailing for IC, with Mines causing no
problems for Russ Dark of Jezz at
the back. A special mention should
go to Simon Day, who refereed a
tough game very well, despite what
may have been said on the pitch!
FOOTBALL
Stormer
London Hospital—1
IC lsts—4
IC stormed back to the top of the
Premier Division with an impressive
demolition of bottom side London
Hospital.
Eager to impress after t w o
successive defeats, IC attacked with
vigour from the offset, creating
numerous chances but failing to
convert any of them. L o n d o n
Hospital then had the audacity to
take the led on their first real attack;
a free kick o n the left found an
unmarked man and his speculative
header somehow looped over the
embarrassed keeper.
IC were still behind going into the
second half but they kept pressing
forward, looking for ways to break
down the packed defence. The
inevitable equaliser came after ten
minutes of the second half from Pip
Peel who made himself some space
in the area to fire home superbly.
From then on there was only going
to be one winner as Mick Plummer's
searing runs down the right flank
tore their defence apart. Pip Peel
soon added another and a fine win
was rounded off with an own goal
and a strike from Nigel Collier.
CROSS COUNTRY
Running in
Richmond
The fifth race of the London
Colleges League, held at Richmond
Park, was organised by the IC
C r o s s - C o u n t r y C l u b . T h e
unseasonal weather had given rise
to an extremely dry course, which
almost made it into a road race,
except for the first mile which was
run on horse track. In fact, the start
was the most demanding part of the
race, as everyone scrambled for
position o n the strength-sapping
surface. The course came onto grass
after about a mile, and alternated
between grass and 'road' for the
remainder.
The team has been struck by an
injury crisis; knee, calf, back, groin
and achilles strains have weakened
our squad. Frank Dudbridge had
hoped for another top ten placing,
but on the day suffered a loss of
form, and dropped back to finish
33rd. O u r next man was Dave
Knight (37th), who caught Frank
after three miles but was too
knackered to take advantage,
followed to placed behind by Stefan
Ledin, breaking 40 for the first time.
Matt Lynas, running with a back
injury sustained while orienteering,
came in 46th. Our other two scorers
were Pete Smith (74th) and Ramin
' D i l ' (94th). Despite a below-par
race, the team still made fifth place
to confirm its league position. Frank
has moved u p to fourth i n the
individuals (in the first division).
There is one race left in the series,
a 10km road race in Battersea Park.
Coach Bill Mason marked the
club's success by declaring that all
the crews would have extra hard
outings on Sunday morning, to
make sure that everybody wins next
time.

Thick and
Fast
Imperial College VI—5
C X W M III—4
In a high scoring contest, IC VI
never looked i n danger of losing
their grip and ran out comfortable
winners to extend their unbeaten
run.
O n a small pitch it was not
surprising that the goals started
flying in well before half time. IC got
the better of these early exchanges
thanks to some fine goals by Nigel
Sale, Simon Barrye and Byron
Wood to lead 3-2 at half-time. In a
hectic and wild second half IC
clinched the contest when Ian
Charlton and Simon Barrye scored.
A n d y Draine, John McKnight and
some others were rather fortunate
to finish the game without entering
the referee's book as some of their
protests to what were admittedly
some incredulous decisions, were
not exactly fit for prime time
viewing.
BOAT CLUB
Five out of
Seven
Last Saturday's Henley Fours Head
was dominated b y the Imperial
College Boat Club. Imperial Crews
won five of the seven categories that
they entered.
In the first major race of the year,
the Lady novices picked up their
first pots, after only four months of
rowing. The mens novices also put
in an impressive performance,
coming in over 40 seconds ahe;d of
their nearest rivals. The senior 2
coxless, senior 1 coxless and open
coxed crews all won their categories
easily, despite cold and very windy
conditions. The open coxed for also
won the overall competition with
the fastest time of the day.
The senior 3 crews were all
unlucky not to do better i n their
events. The second men's four and
the ladies four both suffered
unfortunate clashes with other boats
and river banks. The first senior 3
four vame in well ahead of most of
the other crews in their category but
were beaten into second place by an
experienced crew f r o m t h e
University of London boat club.
ORIENTEERING
Going for it
in Guildford
Last Sunday the Orienteering Club
went to its first major event of the
year; held in Surrey, just south of
Guildford. The competition area
was an intricate and beautiful pine
forest and heathland, definitely the
best area the club has been to for
several months. The weather was
mild and sunny which made for
ideal orienteering conditions.
Despite the long and tough courses
all the IC competitors achieved fast
times, and the prospects for this
season are looking good. The
journey home was memorable and
we didn't get lost!
DANCE
Swing that
Thing
O n Saturday February 4, Sheffield
University hosted an inter-varsity
competition at which the Imperial
College contingent of A , B and C
teams were but three among the
many attending from all over the

tremendous occasion and was made
all the more special by a spectacular
demonstration b y the W o r l d

Marcus and Karen Hilton.
Competitively, the three teams
had a very successful evening; the
B team stormed home to sweep
away the B team trophy and the A
