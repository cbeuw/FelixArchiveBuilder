Input!
Ladies, Gentlemen and yet more
gentlemen of Imperial College,
FELIX is proud to announce the
reappearance of the Science Page.
This week w e present a peculiar
article on strange matter. To come:
Holography and Optical Computing
and a n explosive article o n
Chernobyl. This, however, may be
where we have to stop. A page like
this, in a college like this should be
bursting with articles on a myriad of
subjects f r o m aeronautics to
zoology.
If y o u are a researcher convinced
that your latest project will be the
greatest leap forward this century,
or if y o u are a h u m b l e
undergraduate with a pet subject, I
want to hear from you. I do not
want this page to sink without trace
beneath the boundless reserves of
apathy for which IC is renowned.
Surely not every person in college
wants to become an accountant or
IndSoc chair. Somewhere, buried
deep i n some forgotten corner of
some forgotten lab there is someone
with a genuine enthusiasm for his
subject. Professors, PhDs, BEngs,
BScs, M D s , undergrads, labtechs
get your pencils out and write. This
is a broad church: articles on
subjects such a science and politics,
science and philosophy, science,
drugs and rock and roll will all be
welcome.
A few ideas to get y o u started. Last
week's FELIX carried a feature
.proclaiming creation superior to
evolution as a theory. For God's
sake, to coin a phrase, will some
devout evolutionist reply? A few
w e e k s a g o , a former u n i o n
president advocated closing much of
the royal college of science. Let the
voices of the scientists be heard.
If you have a written article, or just
a few spare ideas, I will be delighted
to hear from you. Pop into the office
any lunchtime or evening or leave
a note in the Science Editor's pigeon
hole. Remember, the Lab Book is
mightier than the sword.
It is as dense as an atomic nucleus but several thousand times the
size. It can devour matter and we may soon be able to make it. It is,
as Simon Bradshaw explains 'Strange Matter.'
Something strange
Imagine a form of matter so dense
that a speck big enough to see
would weigh millions of tonnes. A
form of matter that eats normal
matter releasing incredible amounts
of energy. A form of matter that
could have a dramatic impact o n
science a n d technology. Soon
perhaps you won't have to imagine
it, because several theoretical
physicists seriously think that they
can make it.
What we are talking about is
strange matter. Its name comes not
from its unusual properties but
rather because it contains so-called
'strange quarks'. But what exactly
is a quark and w h y are some types
stranger than others?
Matter is made of atoms, and
atoms are made of electrons
surrounding a nucleus. The nucleus
is made of heavy particles called"
protons and neutrons, and if you
left physics at O or A level that is
likely to be as far i n as you got.
Physicists are now fairly confident
that they know something of the
structure of these particles; they
believe them to be made of even
more fundamental particles called
quarks (after a reference in James
Joyce's Finnegan's Wake). Current
theory calls for six quarks, dubbed
Up, Down, Charm, Strange, Top
and Bottom. They all have either 2/3
or -1/3 of the charge of a proton,
incontrast to normal subatomic
particles which have whole number
charges (e.g a proton has +1 charge,
an electron has -1 charge).
A proton is thought to be made up
of two Ups and a D o w n , whilst
aneutron would be two Downs and
an U p . Since matter is mainly
protons or neutrons (electrons do
not contain quarks) then it is mainly
made up of U p and D o w n quarks.
But there are other quarks available,
and they could well have a hand
too.
Up and D o w n quarks like to
congregate in threes as described. A
large drop of U p and D o w n quarks
would normally be unstable. If
though some Strange quarks are
added then the drop becomes more
stable. A couple of years ago it was
suggested that drops with masses of
more than a few protons, made up
of equal numbers of Up, D o w n and
Strange quarks, could be totally
stable. The droplet would appear to
be a large atomic nucleus, except
that whereas atomic nuclei become
more unstable the larger they grow
(so heavy elements like uranium are
radioactive because their oversize
nuclei fall to bits), strange matter
drops are stable no matter h o w big
they become. Because a lump of
strange matter behaves like a giant
atomic nucleus, it is very, very
dense. A lump the mass of the sun
would be only a few miles across.
Strange matter has another
intriguing property though. It eats
normal matter. Protons are easily
absorbed, but absorbing a neutron
releases immense quantities of
energy) effectively what you would
get by converting the neutron totally
to energy(E = mc2
strikes again).
Since over 50% of ordinary matter
is madeup of neutrons, if you feed
some to strange matter then over
half of it will be converted to energy.
At this rate about tenkilos of
ordinary matter (of any sort!) would
provide as much energy as the
typical nuclear plant does in a year.
If strange matter is so dense, how
do you hold on to it? Fortunately
this problem is easily solved.
Strange matter eats both protons
and neutrons, but whilst neutrons
are neutral, protons are positively
charged. Hence after eating
ordinary matter, a drop of strange
matter becomes positively charged
and can be held i n place by an
electric field. This also explains why
a l u m p of strange matter, if
dropped, would not devour the
whole Earth. The more it absorbed,
the more positively charged it would
become, until soon it would repel
ordinary atomic nuclei pushing it
aside. If a strange matter drop
wasbeing used as a power source,
it would have to have its positive
charge p e r i o d i c a l l y r e d u c e d
otherwise it would develop the sub-
atomic equivalent of constipation.
Fair enough, but where do y o u
get your strange matter? Attempts
to look for naturally occurring
droplets have been unsuccessful,
but an Oxford physicist, Richard
D a l i t z , together w i t h other
physicists from California university
at Irvine, thinks that it should be
possible to u s e t h e particle
accelerates at C E R N in Geneva to
produce tiny droplets of strange
matter. These would be passed
through tanks of liquid hydrogen
(which contain large numbers of
protons) to grow them to a stable
mass (several thousand times that
of a proton). The strange matter
drop resulting from this would be
held i n a containment field and
slowly fed matter to absorb. A s it
did so it would release intense
gamma radiation which would be
absorbed by shielding, heating it up
in the process. Free heat, and free
energy.
If strange matter really can exist,
and if it can be made i n the
laboratory, we may yet see the long
awaited free lunch of truly cheap
energy. Strange, but true.
