Malaysia
Here's the place of sun-washed
landscape, of d a p p l e d trees,
sparkling shores, lakes and bays,
graceful people, different races
living harmoniously.
Malaysia is situated in Southeast
Asia just north of the equator. It
consits of two regions, Peninsula
Malaysia, o n the southernmost tip
of mainland Asia and East Malaysia
on Borneo Island. It is a rich and
fertile land populated by some 17
million people made up of Malays,
C h i n e s e , Indians, a n d the
indigenous people of East Malaysia.
One word describes Malaysia.
Fascinating. Simply because of its
immense variety of attractions.
Historic buildings river safaris,
snake temples, scuba diving, orang
utans, golf, bird watching, sailing,
handicraft, or just sun and surf, it's
all in Malaysia. Perhaps the most
fascinating of all however is the
p e o p l e . M a l a y s i a ' s many
communities each has its o w n
dances, dramas and festivals, all
throughout the year.

Pakistan
Pakistan is situated in the Indian
subcontinent between India and
Iran. Its history can be traced back
to 2500 BC when a highly developed
civilisation flourished in the Indus
V a l l e y . P a k i s t a n i cities were
flourishing before Babylon was built
and its people practised the art of
good living before the Ancient
Greeks.
It is a fascinating country as there
you can go skiing or trekking among
the highest mountains in the world,
wander around on sites of ancient
civilisations, see historic places such
as the Khyber Pass or simply enjoy
the breathtaking beauty of our
Northern areas.
The Pakistan Society at IC aims to
promote every aspect of Pakistan
and act as a social platform for
Pakistanis at I C w e celebrate all
Pakistani national holidays a n d
squash, cricket and football are
among our sports activities.

Italy
Italy has long been k n o w n for its
sense of style, its openness to the
world's cultures and its tradition of
excellence in the arts, science and
architecture.
In the last few years a number of
Italian students and students with
Italian ties have increased and the
society was set up the in order to
give people the opportunity to
know more about one of the leading
European countries.
Anyone interested in joining the
Italian Society, please contact M r
Rony durek, Chem Eng 2 or internal

Hellenic Society
The Hellenic Society's aim is to
promote the national and cultural
features of Greece in IC.
Greece, a country with a history
of three t h o u s a n d years is
considered by many people as the
origin of civilisation. It's the joining
bond between Europe, Asia and
Africa. The land of the sun and the
sea.
During many years of its rough
history, Greece was under foreign
occupation. Greek people have
made an enormous struggle to gain
their national independence and
just i n the early years of this
century, Greece—as it stands
today—was formed. Nowadays
Greek people are working for
progress and peace in their country
and in the whole world.

Cyprus
The cliches of the Mediterranean
holiday really do come true i n
Cyprus, the longest island in the
East Mediterranean. The sun really
does shine bright for most of the
year and the beaches really are
unspoiled. Behind this tranquility,
however, lurks a long history of
foreign rule going back some 8000
years. C y p r u s became a n
independent state in 1960. In 1974
Turkish forces invaded Cyprus. A s
a result 40% of the island was
occupied and one third of the
population uprooted. Today, fifteen
years later, Turkey continues its
u n l a w f u l occupation. Even as
Europe becomes united, Cyprus, a
small European state remains
divided.
E Evzeniou, Mech Eng 2
President Cypriot Society.
Sri Lanka
The island of Sri Lanka (Ceylon) has
held a special fascination for the
visitor over many centuries. It has
been said that 'there is no island i n
the world that has attracted the
attention of authors i n so many
distant ages and so many different
countries as Ceylon' and also that
'there is probably n o place that
occurs so frequently or is so
correctly situated i n ancient maps.
Today the Republic of Sri Lanka
has a population of over 16 million
people. It's economy is largely
agricultural and consists of rice
cultivation, rice being the staple
food, and three major commercial
crops: tea (for which the island is
world famous), rubber and coconut.
Some of its ancient exports such as
gems, cinamon and spices retain an
important place in the economy.
The p r i n c i p a l nationality,
comprising about 8 0 % of the
population, is the Sinhalese. The
other major nationality is the
Tamils, speakers of the Tamil
language and mostly followers of
Hinduism.
Samantha Kappagode, Maths 3
President Sri Lanka Society.
Singapore
The Malay Annals record that
Singapore derives its name from
'Singa' which means lion. This is
probably from the anecdote of a
Malay prince naming the city after
sighting the beast in the island.
The country has no national
resources but its dynamic people
have made Singapore into the most
important finance, production and
trading centre between H o n g Kong
and the Persian Gulf.
The IC Singapore Society aims to
promote interaction and friendship
between Singaporean a n d non-
Singaporean students of the College
and also introduce the cultures ad
philosophies of South East Asia.
You can experience South East
Asian cooking at the Singapore food
stall at International Night when we
will be offering Fried Bee H o o n (or
vermicilli), T a o H u G o r e n g
(beancurd salad).
Happy Eating.
