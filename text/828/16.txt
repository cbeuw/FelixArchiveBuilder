President
pooped
Nathanael Johansen-Allison, one of
two candidates standing for the post
of Royal College of Science Union
President, w a s disqualified at
Thursday's Hustings U G M for
breaking publicity rules. T h e
r e m a i n i n g candidate, C a r o l
Luscombe was unopposed and was
subsequently ratified as
President-elect.
Mr Johansen-AUison used defaced
copies of M s Luscombe's posters as
part of his campaign. He also failed
to provide a photo and manifesto for
the election edition of the R C S U
magazine Broadsheet. He claims that
he was not told that the posters
broke election rules u n t i l
Wednesday evening when he was
able to find a copy of the publicity
rules. He also claims that he was not
i n f o r m e d of the magazine's
publication.
The R C S U Returning Officer
deemed the election bid invalid on
Wednesday and an appeal was
lodged to be heard at the Hustings
Meeting. M r Johansen-Allison did
not speak i n his o w n defence. H e
later told F E L I X that he w a s
unaware that he had such speaking
rights and felt that the way his
campaign had been treated was
typical of the 'mason-like' attitude
of R C S Union.
The Returning Officer claims to
have held the election strictly
according to the rules and that it is
not his duty to pass these rules on
to the candidates.
President-elect Carol Luscombe
later told FELIX that this was not the
way she wanted to w i n the election
but that M r . Johansen-Allison had
'seriously bent' the rules and had
had to be disqualified. A t the same
meeting, Sarah Dixon was ratified
as the n e w H o n o r a r y Junior
Treasurer. Elections for the posts of
Vice-President, Honorary Secretary
and Academic Affairs Officer will be
held on Tuesday 21st February.
Ravioli stuffers unite
Tuesday lunchtime saw beleaguered
Guilds Vice President Max Kallios
setting u p a ' R a v i o l i E a t i n g
Competition' i n Beit Quad. The
competition, which raised money
for R a g , consisted of seven
contestants trying to consume as
much Ravioli as possible. The
winner was Phil Houder (DoC 3)
who managed to get through 21bs of
the stuff in six minutes. The general
feeling of the afternoon towards this
culinary event was reported to be
'good sauce, lousy pasta'.
Anti-semitic grafitti
Jewish Society posters were found
burnt and a number of nearby
posters were grafitied with anti
Jewish slogans on Friday. The
slogans included the phrase 'save
the l a n d of the Jesus a n d
Mohammed and f*ck the Jews'. The
incident has ' d e e p l y upset'
members of Imperial College Jewish
Society.
A n A 2 size poster, marked with
the caption ' G o d bless Palestine'
was also found on the scene. The
poster, headed 'Israeli Butcher',
compared Jews with members of the
Nazi party.
Chairman of Imperial College
Friends of Palestine Society told
FELIX that the Society was not
responsible for the incident. 'It is
racist and unacceptable' he said. He
went on to suggest that the attack
had been caried out i n order to
'discredit' Friends of Palestine.
The Union Executive Committee
have mandated' H o n Sec (Events)
Ian Morris to write to the Friends of
Palestine expressing the Unions
concern at the incident. He also
intends to write a similar letter to the
Islamic Society.
Mr Morris suggested that the
attack may have originated from
outside of College. He pointed out
that any students within College
involved in the incident would be
sent to College d i s c i p l i n a r y
Committee and would probably face
expulsion.
i t s very difficult to catch this sort
of thing. We cannot pin it down to
anyone,' he said.
Chem Eng coup
A new centre for research into
Process Simulation, Integration and
Control will be formed under the
auspices of the C h e m i c a l
Engineering Department at IC i n
1990. The research contract, worth
£42million over 6 years, w a s
a n n o u n c e d i n the C h e m i c a l
Engineering Department this week
by Professsor Roger Sargeant, who
will head the centre. Professor
Sargeant is the former head of
Chemical Engineering at IC. The
centre will be sufficiently large to be
autonomous but the question of
whether it will be a separate
department is still under
negotiation.
The plans anticipate the building
of an additional floor o n the
Rodderick Hill Building, i n the
Chemical Enguneering department,
which would house the 50 P h D
students and 35 members of staff
the centre would require.
This new style of interdisciplinary
research centre will comprise three
previously separate research
groups; Systems from Chemical
Engineering, Control from Electrical
Engineering and Industrial Systems
at University College.

Rag o n Valentine's Day. Victims

The M e c h a n i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g
Department's record breaking

Wednesday. A t the same time a
typhoon in India tore the roofs of
countless innocent people's homes
and blew the candle out from a long
distance. There was a national
holiday to celebrate the candle's
l i g h t i n g a n d street parties
throughout the country proclaimed
their joy at the culmination of M r
Sean Crofton's project. M r Crofton
said afterwards, 'I felt a bit of a prat
when I had to admit the problem
with the calculations as I received
my Knighthood, but that's the way
it goes I guess.'
