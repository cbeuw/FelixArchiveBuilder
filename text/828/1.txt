Over 800 students gathered outside
the Department of Education and
Science yesterday for a rally i n
protest against Student Loans. The
rally was organised by the National
Union of Students' London branch
( N U S L o n d o n ) , as part of
T h u r s d a y ' s N U S N a t i o n a l
Education Shutdown.
Speakers at the rally reported on
action taken b y L o n d o n ' s
Universities, Polytechnics a n d
Colleges of Further Education,
ranging from a blockage of mail at
Kings College to a strike by catering
staff i n support of students at
Thames Polytechnic.
The meeting w a s strongly
supported by a wide variety of
educational establishments,
including the London College of
Printing, the London School of
Economics, Middlesex Polytechnic,
and Thames Polytechnic. Pupils
from Pimlico School, with which IC
has a student teaching connection,
were also present.
The meeting dispersed peacefully
after a number of speeches calling
for greater action by the National
N U S Executive and further marches
through London.
N U S London General Secretary
Phil Woodford told FELIX that he
felt the meeting had been 'very
positive' with 'students showing
their anger at the Government's
proposals.'
A r o u n d L o n d o n , U n i v e r s i t y
College Students Union organised
a picket of the College's entrances,
and an 'Overdraft Disco' i n the
evening, which was free to students
with bank overdrafts. The London
School of Economics reported a
large number of lectures cancelled
for the education shutdown and
held a 'Bop against Baker' i n the
evening. Elsewhere, the University
of London Union (ULU) acted as an
information centre throughout the
day i n support of the N U S
education shutdown and held a
leaflet distribution at Oxford Circus.
At Imperial College, the Union
Bar was open throughout the day,
whilst Pool a n d Table Football
tournaments were held in the Union
Snack Bar and information sheets
were distributed to students. M P for
Tottenham, Bernie Grant also spoke
to 50 students in the Union Lounge.
IC Union President, Nigel Baker
told FELIX that although IC Union
was supporting the N U S ' National
Education Shutdown, the College
had refused to support students by
rearranging lectures. He claimed the
College's lack of support was due to
the poor turnout for I C U ' s lobby of
Parliament last month. Lectures
were rescheduled around the
College for 250 or so students to
attend the lobby. M r Baker told
FELIX that the Rector had pointed
out the lack of support as a reason
for not supporting any further
action. He added that the Union
was 'trying to take the positive side'
by offering students an alternative
to lectures on the shutdown day
rather than encouraging students to
boycott lectures. M r Baker went on
to complain at the lack of support
by students for the organisation of
the shutdown at IC and the Union's
vigil outside the DES on February 6.

N U S ' action against student loans
culminates on Saturday February 25
when a national gathering of
students will march from Victoria
Embankment to Kennington Park,
where a Festival is planned. IC
Union is supporting the march and
will meet i n Beit Quadrangle at
H a m . M r Baker told FELIX that he
hopes to have an Imperial College
Union banner for the event and
plans to distribute publicity next
week.
The College are taking legal advice
following threats by the Students'
Union to sue the College if students
are deprived of degrees by the
action of the A s s o c i a t i o n of
University Teachers (AUT).
The Union have been informed by
legal experts that they would have
a very good case to sue for the cost
of fees and maintainance for a repeat
year for those students deprived of
their degree due to the A U T ' s
examination boycott. It is estimated
that such action could cost the
College upto £44 million.
The A U T began their boycott,
which affects 70,000 undergraduates
throughout the country, at the start
of the term, in protest against the
Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals (CVCP) refusal to present
a pay offer for the 1988/89 session.
The C V C P have since offered a 3%
pay rise w h i c h they admit is
'embarassingly low.' Wages for
academics currently range from
£9200 for lecturers to £29,000 for
professors.
IC Union President, Nigel Baker
told FELIX that the threat of legal
action would force the College to
put pressure on either the C V C P or
the A U T for an end to the action. He
pointed out that the College might
take legal action against A U T
members for breach of contract,
should the Union go ahead with its
legal claim.
President of the Imperial College
Branch of the A U T , Susan Parry
said that she was unhappy with the
Students Union decision.
'It would be more constructive for
the students if they put pressure on
the C V C P and the Department of
Education and Science' she said.
