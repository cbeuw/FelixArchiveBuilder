Leslie Nielsen
An interview with the star of
Naked Gun by Sumit Guha
Leslie Nielsen is one of those actors
with an instantly recognisable face,
if not name. H e has appeared i n
around sixty films and over one
thousand American TV shows. But,
only now, at the age of 62,is he
receiving widespread international
fame and star status.
Before now, many of us knew him
as the silver haired doctor i n
Airplane, produced by the Z A Z team
(Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker). H e
followed that with a short lived
comedy series, Police Squad; a
parody of all those U S cop shows.
He played the bumbling L A cop Lt.
Frank Drebin.
In The Naked gun, he reprises the
role i n an hilarious film version of
Police Squad made, with their usual
lack of subtlety, by the Z A Z team.
In the opening sequence Drebin
goes on holiday to Beirut 'to get
some peace', and ends u p battling
the Ayatollah, Idi A m i n Gadaffi,
Arafat and Gorbachev in a fist-fight!
The film also stars Prescilla
Presley, in her first big screen role,
and Ricardo Montalban as the
mastermind of a plot to assassinate
the Queen.
Director David Zucker says 'I
think that, behind the jokes and the
gags, The Naked gun has a n
important message. It's one man's
struggle within himself to defeat the
demons that terrorise the soul, set
against the backdrop of the Crimean
War.'
We weren't quite convinced, so
we caught up with Leslie Nielsen on
his recent visit to London to get a
few answers.
He walks into the room dressed
casually as if he's just been for a
walk i n the park. H i s mood is
relaxed and jovial. He sits down and
immediately offers us a mint.
'Anybody want a pill', he chuckles.
T h i s g u y is n o t y o u r u s u a l
Hollywood leading man.
Can you tell me something about
your television series?
It was called Police Squad, and it
was i n m y opinion one of the
funniest series. W e h a d some
wonderful things i n it. W e had a
guest star each week who died i n
the main title, stars like L o m e
Greene, Bill Conrad a n d John
Belushi. In the movie and the T V
show we had Big AI—he was too tall
and we didn't have enough money
to get his head in the frame.
We had a shoe-shine guy i n the
series w h o was an expert o n
everything from h o w to coach
baseball, to doing a brain operation.
We always had a phrase, ' G o find
out what the word is on the street',
meaning ' G o get your shoeshine',
and I'd say 'What's happening with
the gymnasium kidnapping', and
he'd say ' O h , I wouldn't know
about that', looking up and d o w n
the street. You give him a dollar and
then he talks, spilling the beans,
telling you how to do anything and
everything.
At the end of the show we have
a freeze frame. W e didn't have
enough money, so w e ' d freeze
manually. So I'd be talking with my
boss. He says at the end 'It's really
wonderful, justice being done'. I'd
say "That's right'—he freezes. N o w
he'd smile and I'd be smiling but
he'd be pouring coffee through my
fingers.
It has become a kind of a cult
show i n the States and even when
we were taken off the air after four
shows, i n L A alone they received
over 20,000 letters from people who
were terribly offended, as well as
critics conducting letter writing
campaigns w h o were totally
offended that A B C had the audacity
and insensitivity to take this breath
of fresh air off the air.'
His tone gets slightly harsher giving
the impression that he would like very
much to string up and dismember each
of the ABC executives responsible.
But i n any event it didn't belong
on television because it's the kind
of humour that y o u must pay
attention to, and when y o u have
somethig u p o n the big screen,
where you've gone there to view it
specifically and since it's bigger than
life you'd see things you don'* see
on T V . Television is like an adjunct
to the family—you get u p i n the
morning and you turn it on, and
you c a n hear it, i t ' s i n the
background. If you hear a laugh or
a noise you take a quick look and
somebody c a n tell y o u what
happened but you listen to it, y o u
don't watch it. With us, o u r
humour, you really have to watch
and pay attention because of its
craziness.
At this time someone opens a door by
mistake. 'Wait a minute', he says
putting on a serious face, 'We do police
work here'. The guy is scared off. 'See
how easy it is'—he smirks.
How and why did you get involved
with this type of humour?
'When I got the script (to Airplane)
for the first time, I called my agent
and said 'I don't want y o u to
negotiate this. Don't tell them, but
I'll pay them to do the part! I'm on
that wavelength, that's my kind of
humour—that style of insanity.
After watching the crisis drama
shows that I've been doing through
the years, I began laughing at
myself, at the grave situations we
were involved i n . So I knew
immediately why they wanted me
for Airplane, because if I behave as
seriously as I d i d i n my regular
work, this stuff would be very
funny.
You get to grips with the Queen of
the film. What do you think of your
chances of a n h o n o r a r y
knighthood, now?
Breakfast wouldn't be bad! In
Canada the monarchists were very
offended and I suspect that there
will be a few people w h o will be
offended. That's the way it goes.
But in general 1 think that the vein
of humour will carry the day and
there'll be no big deal.
What type of people make y o u
laugh?
Anyone w h o catches me off
guard. I like dumb things. I like wit.
1 will try anything and everything
to get a laugh.
What about British humour?
I like British humour. A lot of
American humour takes you by the
hand and leads you through to the
joke. In British comedy you're left
to find the joke yourself. But if it
makes me laugh I like it.
What about Priscilla Presley? D i d
she take well to playing comedy?
She took to it so easily. She's a
very elegant and beautiful woman.
I think that's part of the exterior she
wishes to present to people. So
there she was, across the stage on
our first day. The moment I caught
he eyes I went.
He erases his eyes.
A n d she went,
He crosses his eyes again and makes
a silly face.
A n d that was it. So you've got this
elegant woman who's got that
eleven year-old girl working inside,
ready to make faces. So I knew then
that w e ' d have a lot of fun, and we
did.
You're in the hands of people like
Z A Z . I have such abiding respect
and admiration for them. They're
very funny and supportive. If you
think about the humour i n the
picture there's n o t h i n g mean
spirited about it. It's just affectionate
somehow, so there's no way that
Prescilla would not do well.
At what point w o u l d you draw the
line with their humour?
With the Zuckers I have such
respect for them, not only as
professionals but humans that I
would do almost anything they'd
say. In the e n d I trust their
judgement completely. F o r
example, i n the slaughterhouse
scene, we had a terrific vomit
sequence that we cut. It was just
gross. I was a little worried about
the ' H i t the F a n ' sequence i n
Airplane, but David (Zucker) took
me to a theatre and, of course, the
kids went mad. So I trust their
judgement.
