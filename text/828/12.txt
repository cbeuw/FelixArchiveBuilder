International Week
International
understanding
organisations, market your ideas,
and then make them happen.
Some examples, in varied stages of
completion, of things we're working
on:
• a study tour of Malta. (Malta also
happens to have the highest
concentration of discos in Europe,
beaches aren't b a d either).
Organised jointly with an AIESEC
committee i n malta, which is
helping to keep the costs to about
a third normal tourists pay.
• A twinning event in Amsterdam,
sponsored by Shell and with the
help of a number of committees
down there. Tour of Shell facilities
included.
participating on a series of seminars
and events organised in conjunction
with LSE, U C L , City and Kings
universities, a n d h o l d i n g a n
AIESEC week here at Imperial
College. A n d that's a selection of
what's available.
AIESEC has a lot to offer. It can
provide you with practical insights
into the business world, provide
training opportunities to test your
skills. Whether you want brownie
points by exposing yourself to
companies, work overseas, need
contacts outside England or are
bored and want to get off the
g r o u n d , or just w a n t to d o
something new. Find out how to
make AIESEC work for you.
A tribute to the late Salvador Dali
Ever wanted to work somewhere in
South East Asia, America or maybe
even behind the Iron Curtain? Ever
been bumming around Europe,
night time, no place to stay? Does
y o u r College give y o u
claustrophobia? You need a change.
Does all the theory give you mental
constipation? Y o u need to get
something tangible going, you want
to find out more about the business
world, maybe even meet the people
that might give you a job when you
graduate? Do you have some good
ideas, but no cash and connections?
A I E S E C is a direct outcome of
students trying to resolve these
kinds of questions. In the official
lingo, it's 'the world's largest non-
political, non-profit making, entirely
student run organisation'. AIESEC
was started back in 1949 by a group
of students from seven countries,
and is now represented worldwide
in 67 countries, by about 50,000
student members. AIESEC is a
French synonym which stands for
'International Society of Economics
S t u d e n t s ' — b u t h a s been so
successful that it now embraces
students from virtually all areas.
A I E S E C has two aims
• T o increase international
understanding and cooperation.
• To bridge the g a p between
universities and the 'real world'.
Branches are free to move inside
these guidelines, and at Imperial
we're h o p i n g to develop the
undergraduate body by:
• giving students the chance to
expose themselves to companies
and the 'real world'.
• give students the possibility to
have an experience overseas.
• the creation of a fund to sponsor
students projects (irrespective
whether they have anything to do
with AIESEC or not).
We can do this because AIESEC:
• enjoys immense support through
sponsorship and advice from the
business and academic community,
at both national and international
levels.
• can rely o n a n extensive
international network of offices and
committees.
• has motivated a n d creative
members.
Last term, a new branch of AIESEC
was founded. Originating from the
Mech Eng Department, we are now
trying to involve students from all
other departments. Most 1st years
will have by now been subjected to
our r o u s i n g recruitment
presentations. Response has been
varied. With good feedback from
most departments, people have
managed to see the potential uses
of AIESEC. But some departments
certainly surpassed Imperials'
reputation of a staid campus. Faced
by stiff competition from the Civ
E n g Department, the miners
however managed to win our 'Too
fat for sex' award for absolute
apathy. Whose dey?
One of the problems which
confront a lot of people when they
come into contact with AIESEC is
that AIESEC requires them to think
independently, to have ideas—
AIESEC 'only' provides the contacts
and support f o r concepts.
Entrepreneurial spirit is a
prerequisite if you want to get the
most out of AIESEC, and not just
occasionally participate on events.
For example, you have to be able to
go o u t to companies a n d
• a series of business games i n
London, with university teams
competing against each other.
• raise jobs for the internataional
exchange scheme (find out what
that is...)
• the above m e n t i o n e d f u n d
• a shadowing scheme, whereby
you stick to a managers back for a
period of time. Find out whether it
really is that cool being a n
accountant...
In the next couple of weeks we'll be
sending a couple of people overseas
to an international conference i n
B e l g i u m (all expenses paid),
We work in small groups, with
one person u s u a l l y there to
coordinate things. Presently the
teams are.
