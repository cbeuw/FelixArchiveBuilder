Reviews
H o w successful has the f i l m been?
It's done to date about $70 million.
I don't know what the figures mean
myself, but those who do are
grinning and laughing and walking
around whistling.
Are you now a big star?
H o w do you measure that? If it's
exposure—yes. If I'm associated
with this type of fun then I'm
delighted and I hope it continues.
What w o u l d you like to do next?
I don't know. I'm an actor. I've
been at it all my life. I'm still willing
to try everything and 1 enjoy it a
great deal. I hope serious parts are
not ruled out.
Is there going to be a follow-up to
this film?
Yes, they have already begun it.
They were told to go ahead before
we had even opened in the States.
I, as Frank Drebin, would like to go
undercover as a brain surgeon, I
think. They'll have me going to the
Oval Office where I'll be met by
President Bush, who will instruct
me that the undercover assignment
is to find M r Big, i n charge of
international narcotics.
M r Big is going to have to be
Ricardo Montalban, who died in the
first film, but he's going to have an
evil twin, maybe quintruplets—if we
had five stories maybe Ricardo can
die five different times.
The shoeshine guy will be back
and, I think, the freeze frame. I hope
they get back to what the series was
originally.
Do you think there'll be another
series of Police Squad on T V ?
I don't think so. I would prefer
not, myself. It doesn't belong on
television. I would be quite happy
to do one of these insane movies
each year, for a short while anyway.
A n d so our meeting ends and Leslie
Nielsen departs to tackle the likes of
Wogan, on the usual publicity train,
and then back to America to make
more insane movies.
Arthur 2
on the rocks
'It doesn't metter if you're rich or
poor, as long as you can afford
anything on the planet you could
ever want.' A n objective view of life
imparted by Arthur Bach to his new
buttle Fairchild. Many a true word,
as they say.
Dudley Moore has returned to the
screen as the lovable tipsy multi-
millionaire, still quipping his way
through opulent frolics with wife
Linda (Liza Minelli), despite the loss
of his butler and best friend Hobson
(John Gielgud).
The replacement comes in the
form of Fairchild (Paul Benedict)
who offers a sterile subservience
beyond the call of duty. 'Hobson
used to hit me with his hat' says
Arthur 'and call me a spoilt little
shit.' W e must have gone to
different buttlering schools, sir',
replies the astonished Fairchild.
This is the only new face in the
sequel to the 1981 smash hit.
Arthur's would be wife, Susan
Hohnson, and her father Burt return
to hatch a plot aimed at forcing
Arthur into marriage, the principal
move is seizing control of the family
I business, a n d i n the process
r e m o v i n g A r t h u r ' s personal
I fortune. He visits grandma Martha
I who tells him 'Burt Johnson has got
this family by the nuts. Marry the
bitch.' Arthur is determined to get
a job and survive with Linda, who
hopes to adopt a baby.
At this point there is a sharp
change i n the script, hitherto
a m u s i n g a n d at times even
hilarious. A s events compound
against h i m Arthur loses Linda, his
last grip o n sobriety, and most
importantly his witty diaglogue. The
film develops into a rather odd
blend of tear-jerker and comedy.
The parallel deprivation of a rich
man without money and a mother
w i t h o u t a c h i l d are s h o w n ,
d i s p l a y e d as the u n d e r l y i n g
substance of the movie. In his
alcoholically deluded state Arthur
has hallucinations of Hobson, who
shows h i m how to create the
unfeasibly happy ending which we
can all forsee.
W h e n Gielgud appears, skillfully
avoiding a caricature of his definitive
Spitting Image self, it becomes clear
what both Arthur's life and the film
have been lacking all along. His
reappearance provides the best
sequence of the story, a welcome
resurgence.
Despite this, and regardless of
Moore's ability as a comedy actor,
Arthur 2 doesn't quite make the
grade. It is generally funny where
it tries to be, and certainly tore at my
heart-strings where it hoped to, but
overall it remains a confusion of
conflicting feelings.. There are
several more entertaining films
around and I recommend you go
and see one of those instead.

PREVIEW
Twins
It's the combination of the y e a r -
Arnold Schwarzeneggar (Red Heat,
Predator) and Danny De Vito (Throw
Mamma from the Train) as twins
separated at birth. They are the
product of an experiment in science.
Schwarzeneggar plays Julius, the
perfect specimen, who has been
raised on a South Seas island. De
Vito as Vincent, a less than perfect
specimen, a small time hustler.
Julius seeks out Vincent a n d
together they try to track down their
mother, encountering adventure on
the way. Julius discovers sex and
Vincent discovers responsibility.
Well, it sounds to me like
someone had the great idea one day
of teaming up Arnie and De Vito in
a film, but then forgot to provide
them with a plot. It will be very
interesting to see Schwarzeneggar
actually trying to play intentional
comedy. He even makes his singing
debut in this film. The mere thought
curdles my senses.
De Vito may be a lot more adept
at comedy b u t seems to be
rehashing his character of Louie
from Taxi.
It's a publicists dream, and a
chance for critics to sharpen their
tongues. I think curiousity alone will
ensure that this film is a hit. It's a
clever ploy on the part of the film
company—whether the film is good
or bad it'll have people laughing.
In the States the press tore it to
shreds, the public went to see it in
droves and Arnie's wallet got fatter
and fatter. He'll be running for
public office next.
Release Date 17th March.
