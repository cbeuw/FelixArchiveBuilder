A Common
Woman
By Davio Fo, Franca Rame,
performed by Gillian Hanna at the
Half Moon Theatre, Mile End
Road.
The title is misleading in that this is
a compilation of three monologues
performed soley by Gillian Hanna
(of the all-female ' M o n s t r o u s
Regiment' Theatre Group).
'Bless m e Father for I have
sinned', was originally set in Italy
w h e n t h e R e d Brigade were
rampaging. O n e translation to
English the comparable setting was
considered to be the Republic of
Ireland just after the heyday of
flower power. For this playlet the
theatre was filled with incense, as
it took place in a church in the form
of a confessional with a priest. The
confessor was a fifty year old hippy.
Her story was a moving one of
imperfect motherly love, and how
she came to be a hippy. The
portrayal of this mature woman
sitting cross-legged on the church
floor recounting how she got high
on hooch, is extremely funny. It is
also t o u c h i n g , t h o u g h the
introduction of politics (the author
w r o t e Accidental Death of an
Anarchist) is somewhat clumsy and
completely unnecessary.
The Rape is so tense and so
involving that for the duration of the
monologue it seems that the only
object to have even existed was the
h u m i l i a t e d a n d d o w n - t r o d d e n
woman sitting on the chair. She is
an English woman of indeterminate
age w h o recounts her experience
without any running about, unlike
the other monologues. Franca
Rame, w h o wrote this, was herself
r a p e d , a n d t h e intensity of
autobiography shows through i n
the detail of the account. 'I wanted
to drown the chaos in my head' to
the 'sperm trickling d o w n my legs'
show powerfully the humiliation
and degradation at the hands of
those men, and the terror of further
humiliation at the hands of the
police.
In Coming Home Gillian Hanna
plays a truly 'common w o m a n ' in
the old English snobby sense. She
is in her late twenties and lives in
a council house. In a fit of severe
frustration with her busband, she
goes ot to find herself some love to
assuage her passion. There is a
wonderful bed scene in which she
leaps about w i t h a p i l l o w -
pretending it's the man she's been
Short
Circuit 2
Short Circuit was a cinema hit about
three years ago. It was all about a
cute little robot in the big bad world,
with the intelligence and self-
awareness of a Q M C student
courtesy of a handy lightning bolt.
In the sequel, one of the designers
of the robot, Number Five, gets
totally hacked off with making
weapons and goes off to N e w York
to make and sell toy Number Fives.
He lands a big contract to build 1000
in time for Christmas so he calls in
the real Number Five to help out.
All this is complicated by a jewel
robbery sub-plot foiled by our alloy
friend. (Perhaps the toy robots are
the sub-plot, I don't know.)
Basically the film is a mixture of
plots and characters from other
films, so badly put together you can
almost see the joins. The star,
Number Five seems to be a cute
metalic ET with a funny voice and
reminiscent of Crocodile Dundee in
the big city for the first time.
The character of the robot
designer is Indian, and is played by
a made-up white American actor in
such a patronising and cliched way
that some people might find the film
offensive, just like Peter Sellers in
The Party but without the comic
genius of Sellers. There is a n
inevitable romantic interlude i n
which Ben, the Indian designer is
helped out by Number Five (just like
Roxanne).
In H o l l y w o o d today, true
originality is rare and precious, but
in this film the plagiarism is almost
painfully obvious. There are good
moments but these are not all that
frequent and many of the jokes have
been seen before.
When all said and done this is a
tolerable 90 minutes of m i s -
entertainment, more suited to video
than the cinema.

with that day. The man in question
she describes as being 'not quite
sure if he's A C or D C .
This is a comedy—a bit of a jolt
after the deadly serious play
preceding it—with a French farce
twist at the end.
The unifying idea behind these
monologues is to give a bit more
juice to the feminist cause, although
not militantly, b y showing the
woman's point of view.
The theatre is close to Stepney
Green tube and is a horrible breeze-
block barn. Phone 790 4000 for

Salaam
Bombay
Salaam Bombay, released in Britian a
couple of weeks ago must be
a c k n o w l e d g e d as a masterful
accomplishment of cinematography.
Mira Nair in her directorial debut of
a feature has enchantingly captured
the emotions, the comradeship and
suffering of B o m b a y ' s street
urchins. N o aspect of the street life
is left untouched as the story follows
the central character, Chaipau,
through his existence i n a maze of
prostitution, pimps and peddling.
This film is a tribute to human
resilience in an environment where
you are your only friend. Mira has
used the camera with finesse,
leaving one with lingering images
such as when a young girl is shown
scratching o n the w i n d o w of her
mother's bedroom like an alley cat
while watching her mother 'work'
with a client. The film is a triumph
because, ultimately, it is a tribute to
human nature, for it shows that
even i n bleak circumstances the
street urchins show occasions of the
noble sentiments of love and care for
others even though their o w n
survival is uncertain. The film ends
w i t h C h a i p a u s o b b i n g
uncontrollably—he is fated to lead
a life of misery.
This is not a film that will make
you cry. It is a masterpiece that will
make you admire the beauty of film
for capturing human behaviour of
its worst and best amid the colour
of the streets of Bombay. Salaam
Bombay is an international success
winning the Camera d'Or award at
Cannes. Even though the dialogue
is not i n English (the subtitles
showed good translation) this will
not detract from the enjoyment of
a film where the images are of the
foremost importance.
Do not miss this powerful treat,
which is also helping to raise money
for the rehabilitation of Bombay's
street urchins.

Due to the lack of space this week,
a number of reviews could not be
accommodated. We apologise to the
reviewers concerned and hope to
include their material next week. We
will also have reviews of the final
three plays in the War of the Roses
series.
