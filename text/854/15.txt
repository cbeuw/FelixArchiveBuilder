MSF back
ambulances
A demonstration in support of ambulance workers has
been called by the TUC. The Manufacturing, Science
and Finance trade union at I.C. will be taking part,
and they are asking all supporters to assemble in
Trafalgar Square at 1:00 pm on Saturday January 13.
The ambulance unions have requested that only the
staff and families of the emergency services should
go on the march after the assembly.
Money go
round
This term sees the beginning of the 'Research Grant
Stakes'. It is hoped that this will be continued
whensoever I can remember to do it.
This month the trophy goes to Professor C.R.
Hopkins and Dr D.F. Cutler who get £457,212 over
four years from the Medical Research Council (MRC)
for research into 'Identification of transcellular routes
for hydrophilic macromolecules in polarised
monolayers of enterocytes'.
The 'Free-market Economy Booby Prize' awarded
to companies or grant-giving bodies for their tight-
fistedness goes this month to British Gas pic, who
have awarded Dr M.G. Hocking and Dr P.S. Sidky
£1,135 over three years for research into the
'Degradation of Silica Carbide'.
Aids disk at
college
Mr Geoff Reeves, Security officer at I.C. reported
that five 'AIDS computer virus' discs had been sent
to the college. All are now in the custody of Scotland
Yard.
The virus, which is incorporated into an aids
information disk, is said to hide and scramble files
on the hard drive it is resident upon and demand a
fee for returning the files. Written in quick basic, the
virus has plagued London's financial institutions.
Anyone who believes they may have used the disk
in their computer should contact Professor Hynds at
the Computer Centre.
Jolly
hampers
Union Finance Officer Reggie Blennerhassett has won
a £60 Hamper from Fortnum and Masons from the
HUB office Christmas raffle.
Mr Blennerhassett also received a £35 Hamper last
term as compensation by an anonymous benefactor
for the FELIX hamper hoax (issue 853). Ms Jen
Hardy-Smith, Union administrator, refused to reveal
who had paid for it, though she admitted she knew
who it was. Other victims of the hoax received gifts
from the anonymous source—Mr Rob Northey had
a bottle of wine, Mr Geoff Reeves received a box
of crystallised fruit and Mr Harrison got a duck.

Weeks hall
theft
A video recorder was stolen from Weeks Hall over
the Christmas vacation. The theft probably occured
last week when an emergency lock had been put on
the front door to replace the broken main lock.
Knight of
Cheapskate
The rector of Imperial College, Professor Eric Ash,
was knighted in the new years honours. Sir Eric Ash
commented that 'One does feel honoured—it's an
honour for the college as much as for me'. He said
that the Palace did not give specific reasons for the
honours.
Sir Eric Ash was involved in a traffic accident
recently, whilst cycling around Marble Arch and he
said that he would be in crutches for three months.
Engineers
bored
Two thirds of Engineering students will not take up
a career in industry, according to a recent report. The
report, which is backed by the Department of Trade
and Industry and twelve major engineering
companies, is based on a survey of over 1,800
engineering graduates and claims to be the first
attempt to present engineering companies from the
students' point of view.
The actual report is confidential but the main
findings have been released. The researchers say that
only 8% of those questioned 'felt well informed' about
engineering careers and, while almost all students had
some direct experience of industry, 44% claimed that
this work experience had put them off. The milk-
round was frequently criticised for being too close
to the finals. Almost two-thirds of the women
questioned felt that the industry practiced some form
of 'unofficial sex discrimination'.
U N D E R G R O U N D T R A V E L S U R V E Y
Research Services Limited is carrying out a major survey on behalf of London Underground Limited
which will involve counting passengers and handing out questionnaires at all the stations on the
Underground network.
We need to recruit a number of additional fieldworkers in order to complete the project. There will
be opportunities to join our regular fieldforce for longer term employment.
One day will be worked at each station and the job will run from January 29th until Easter. The
work will be regular but need not be full-time and the days and times you could work are very flexible.
Each day will be split into three five hour shifts (7am-12 noon, 12 noon-5pm, 5pm-10pm), and
fieldworkers will be paid £25 for each morning or evening shift and £20 for each afternoon shift.
There will also be a number of three hour shifts. All the work will be carried out from Monday-
Friday. Free travel on all London Regional Transport Services will be provided and an additional
bonus will be paid at the end of the job.
Preliminary interviews will be followed by a one day training course (for which you will be paid).
If you would like further details and an application form please telephone 01-903 1399, ext 25
and ask for Theresa Singleton.
