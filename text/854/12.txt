F e l i X
I should like to welcome everyone back with a
poignant reminder that if you are unhappy with your
course or the general atmosphere at IC you have just
less than a month to withdraw. It is a sad fact that
many people realise too late that they are committed
to three years at IC, which they won't really enjoy.
If you withdraw now, your time at IC will not count
against your chances of obtaining a grant for a course
elsewhere.
Hamper fun
Union Administrator, Jen Hardy-Smith has finally
shown her 'sensitive' side. Last term she was so upset
by the Hamper Hoax in FELIX that she personally paid
for a hamper and goodies for all the parties concerned
on her Harrods account. How generous, I thought,
with a cynical idea of her real motives in the back of
my mind. Now she refuses to say who paid for the
goodies, which probably add up to around £80. The
rumour is that the FELIX staff account will be asked
to foot the bill. The staff account is money earned by
staff members doing outside work for use on social
events.
Let's face it, the amount is tiny and the whole affair
is a storm in a teacup. Reggie seems hardly upset by
any of it; it's good to know that he has a sense of
humour. Not so much can be said for Jen's gloating
letter this issue. If the Union attempts to force FELIX
to pay for something we did not purchase, it will leave
the path open for other clubs to lose funds they have
generated just because they did not toe the Union line.
College's plastering contractor at work
Bodgeit and Legit
Over Christmas the Union had the fire exit from the
Lounge widened to increase the room's fire capacity.
I now live in fear of the building collapsing upon my
head. The door had a concrete lintel to support the
wall above it. This has been replaced with a wooden
beam and four little wedges of scrap wood. Dave
Williams has informed me that a slate lintel will replace
this. The contractors have now plastered the area over
and left without making this alteration. I don't know
much about architecture, but I think that concrete is
somewhat stronger than wood.
I am now considering sending a copy of 'The three
little pigs' to Peter Hallworth; the bit about the
wooden house being blown down may prove
informative.
Congratulations
Congratulations to Sir Eric Ash on his knighthood.
Apparently he wishes us to drop the 'Professor'.
FELIX is happy to announce this honour since 'Sir Ash'
is far easier to type.
Meeting
There will be a staff meeting on Friday. Free drink to
everyone who turns up.
