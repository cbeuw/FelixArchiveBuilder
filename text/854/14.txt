Today's
Graduates
Tomorrow's
Europeans?
â€¢
A single European Market is no longer
merely a possibility - it's an attitude of mind.
With 1992 approaching, banking and finance
organisations are fast waking up to the
advantages of establishing a continental
financial network.
With over 100 years' experience in the
U K financial markets to draw on, we couldn't be
better placed to capitalise. And the vision of
Europe we can offer today's graduates is one
which we believe will reflect their own
ambitions.
Take our Consumer Services Group, and
four crucial areas of its business - General,
Financial, Actuarial and IT. For those
graduating in 1990 the training scheme which
awaits you is in no sense parochial.
For one year, we'll immerse you in real
issues and live projects; providing the
experience from which you'll develop the skills
to shape your career. We'll guide you, encourage
you, push you to your limit - and generously
reward your success. We may even surprise you
with what we enable you to achieve.
Our aim is to produce tomorrow's key
managers for our European Group, which
demands raw material of the highest quality. In
addition to a relevant degree, you'll need the
confidence, energy and sheer personality to
confront the toughest challenges, plus the
creative intellect to question the easiest options.
Convince us of your potential, and you'll
start in September with a very competitive
salary and an excellent range of benefits.
Succeed, and you'll soon discover that
opportunities for fast-paced professional
development are diverse, substantial, and
sometimes international.
