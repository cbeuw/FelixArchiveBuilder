It has been a long haul from the
beginning of life on Earth to the
present—some three billion years.
Human history represents merely
the last 10,000 years at most, and
human existence perhaps 2 or 3
million, and mammals about 175
million. The dinosaurs lasted about
200 million years ending about 70
million years ago; therefore they
had a reign which lasted about 100
times the reign of man as top
species.
T h e conceits of mankind, the
most outrageous of which describes
us as made in the image of the
creator of the whole universe, are
a kind of working model designed
to justify our behaviour. O u r
leaders have described the world as
created for us alone; other species
are to be treated as so inferior that
we do not have to consider their
feelings, which are said to bear no
comparison with ours which are
infinitely more delicate for, only we
have souls (whatever that may
mean!).
Since the industrial revolution
and our discoveries of physics and
c h e m i s t r y , o u r m a t h e m a t i c a l
techniques that give accurate
descriptions of the mechanics of
matter and our m o r e recent
penetration into the structure of life
which places all biological forms
under one c o m m o n ancestry, those
earlier models of the universal
heirarchy look absurd, and in many
respects disgraceful and certainly
unworthy of our intellect. M a n y
pure concepts such as truth have
become comparative and idealisms
such as faith have become things
from which we want freedom.
W e have d i s c o v e r e d that
evolution has been marvellously
creative: we, and all life, have been
beautifully integrated into what the
discards the less fit varieties and
they become extinct. Today there
are many estimates of the number
of species that have become extinct
as a result of our activities. A n d if
they do not become extinct there
will be no r o o m for further
evolution of those which survive.
What we have to answer for is the
ruthlessness of the destruction we
have unnecessarily caused, and we
need to examine the methods we

Victorians called the Balance of
Nature. But an evolved system is
still evolving. Evolution depends on
the environment and its present
occupants, and is continuing as
rapidly as ever. But it was never
planned: the best we can say is that
it happened and has arrived where
it is now.
However it has never really
arrived, but continues to travel. It
has no objective, but without
continual changes going on in the
environment and all the other
species trying out their various
mutations each species is forced to
select the fittest from all its current
varieties. This brings us to the first
dreadful feature of its behaviour—it

have been employing to ensure the
survival of the less fit members of
our own species.
W e continue to employ methods
which do not look at the more
distant c o n s e q u e n c e s b e y o n d
t o m o r r o w , b e y o n d the next
election, to the lifetime of our
children, our grandchildren, and
their grandchildren, in fact of all or
any of posterity. Evolution itself
certainly takes no thought for the
morrow, in spite of its creative
success up until the present. W h y
is this?
It is because we are the first
species to attempt to occupy the
whole world at the same time. W e
are grabbing the whole habitat for
ourselves. That is why we destroy
species, whereas true evolution
would only carry the competition
within very limited habitats. Instead
of allowing extravagantly evolved
species to live on in remote places,
we have declared nowhere to be
remote, and no other species'
habitat is out of bounds to us, and
we can eat any of the occupants we
choose.
Clearly this could be developed
into a really damning indictment of
Industrial Revolution M a n . Shall
we have to prepare a defence, an
apology, or a promise of better
behaviour, or shall we excuse
ourselves on the grounds that we are
merely carrying out the techniques
which creative evolution has taught
us, and if we are a bit too efficient
that is evolution's fault and we have
been unexpectedly good students.
It's a thought!
