Rag week so far has been deemed
'excellent' this year by M a r c
'Penguin' Ellis, R a g Chairman,
though he said that 'publicity, apart
from Felix, has been low.' It will
be some time before the final figure
raised during the week is calculated,
but M r Ellis estimates that it will be
from £5,000 to £10,000.
In Tuesday's Slave Auction City
and Guilds President T i m Proctor
auctioned, amongst many others,
the U n i o n Receptionists Michelle
and Cathy, who were dressed as
Tweedles D u m and Dee.

pints o f 55 different beers from 6
different suppliers. H e said that
bitter ran out at about 9.45pm,
though at its conclusion at 11.00pm
some cider was still left. There was
virtually no mess and little trouble,
except for an altercation between
the F O P P E S o c (Fuck O f f Poofy
Plant Eaters Society) and some
students from T h e Royal School of
Mines over a four foot vibrator,

Drugs
A member of staff from Bernard
Sunley House faces disciplinary
action after being suspected of
drugs peddling. T w o students who
were also involved have been
suspended from the hall pending the
results o f their tribunal.
Linda Donegan, Warden o f the
H o u s e , m a d e the f o l l o w i n g
statement. ' T w o undergraduates
have been suspended from Bernard
Sunley House pending the outcome
of both the residence and college
disciplinary tribunals, following an
incident involving drugs. T h e
janitor at E v e l y n Gardens has also
been suspended and the normal
college procedures are taking
place.'
She added that as a warden it was
her duty 'to safeguard the welfare
of the students in m y trust and also
the reputation o f the college.' She
said that drugs o f any nature can be
extremely dangerous - particulary
when taken with alcohol, and that
it was very fortunate that someone
was on hand to control the situation
before it went any further.
'I don't think most students are
aware o f the seriousness of taking
or selling drugs o f any kind. Is it
really worth sacrificing y o u r
University career or possibly even
your life for?' added M s Donegan.
' W e do not condone the use of
any drugs', said I C U President, Zoe
Hellinger.

T h e theft was stopped by G i n a
Mortley and Steve Farrant, I C U
H o n Sec (Events), who was naked
at the time. Sarah Payne, Secretary
of St. M a r y ' s Students U n i o n , said
that 'they are trying to find the
people who did it' and added 'they
would try and deal with the matter
internally.'
Zoe' Hellinger, I C U President,
told Felix that she had the names of
two of the St. M a r y ' s students
involved in the attempted theft. She
e x p l a i n e d that the students
concerned had two options; either
to pay for the damage incurred or
to face a U n i o n disciplinary
committee. This committee has the
power to ban students from union
premises. If the latter fails then they
may face a College disciplinary
committee, which could result in
the students being banned from
studying at Imperial.
college, Professor Bruce Sayers,
has sent a letter to M r Angus
Fraser, Managing Director of I C ,
on the matter. This letter was
generally leaked and has been
posted all around college. The letter
c o m p l a i n s o f ' b r u t a l i t y ' a n d
'impertinence' in the way changes
were being handled. Professor
Sayers also warned of 'career
executives' w h o had 'neither
o u t s t a n d i n g c o m p e t e n c e o r
dedication to Imperial College'.
Unfortunately Professor Sayers was
unavailable for further comment as
he was attending a W o r l d Health
Organisation conference at the time
of going to press. N o personnel
from College administration were
prepared to comment o n the
abrasive criticisms contained in the
letter, except the Rector, Sir E r i c
A s h , who said 'I do not agree with
the comments' during the Rector's
question time last Thursday. H e
added that the letter contained
'intemperate language.' T h e letter
gained a positive response from the
unions.
Seventy-five per cent o f M S F
members voted in the ballot. Sue
Sharpe, M S F Secretary, said the
low numbers were due to absences
and people attending courses, not
lack of interest. In the vote, 63 per
cent voted for strike action while 89
per cent voted for 'action short of
strike action'. E a c h ballot paper
carried a warning saying that people
taking industrial action may be in
breach o f contract and that they
could therefore be sacked for taking
part in a strike.
A meeting takes place today
between management and unions.
G o r d o n M a r s h a l l , Director o f
Estates, said the management
position has not altered and that the
changes were part of the College's
'restructuring and change policy'.
He added that he was just following
orders.
M r Steve N e w b o l d , the
management negotiator, said they
were still looking for a 'mutually
a c c e p t a b l e s o l u t i o n ' . H e
commented that it was 'generally
agreed' the security structure
needed improving to reduce cost
and bring it in line with the needs
of Imperial College. H e stated that
Management had put forward a
proposal and any suggestions by
Unions to improve the security
s y s t e m w o u l d be ' s e r i o u s l y
considered'.

Theta Stolen
T h e Royal College o f Science
U n i o n ( R C S U ) mascot, Theta, was
stolen on Sunday night by ex-
students o f the R C S U w h o
disagreed with the new mascotry
rules.
Chris Davidson. Theta bearer,
said that two e x - R C S U students,
Dave Burns and Paul Wilmot
attempted to remove Theta from the
bar but were confronted by a group
of students. W h e n it looked as
though it was going to turn into a
brawl, M r . Davidson decided that
it was probably best to let the ex-
students take Theta until they could
sit down and discuss the current
situation.
O n e ex-student c o m m e n t e d
'Theta means so much to so many
people.. .Theta is very valuable and
very delicate. Playing with the new
rules would mean that Theta would
not be handled with care and it may
get broken. W e don't want to see
that happen.'
Simon Banton, the representative
of the R C S Association on the
Union Council, said 'in my opinion
mascotry should have been banned
there and then when the guy got
hurt (see Felix 914)... all that will
happen is that it will escalate again,
cars will be re-introduced, and
someone else will get hurt or
killed.'
Following this incident six life
members of the Union iare due to
have their memberships rescinded,
and at the moment a temporary
Theta is being used.
