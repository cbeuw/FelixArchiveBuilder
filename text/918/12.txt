- E N O , Until December 11
A gilt picture frame circumscribes
the tale of regal assassination. Verdi
was compelled to transform the
drama to America so as not to incite
unrest in Naples, but Edmund
Tracey's translation delivers us to
the court of K i n g Gustavus III of
Stockholm. T h e sands o f time
continue to fail before the king, are
renewed with his escape from his
assassins but finally the huge hour
glass is smashed and the K i n g is
shot. A s so frequent in such
overstated operatic tragedy, he is by
woman fallen, betrayed by his
closest friend, enraged by jealousy.
The most stunning effect was the
dramatic sets, emphasising the
players with huge, terrifying
shadows on dirt-smeared walls,
c o m p l e m e n t e d by dark, b o l d
costumes on the sinister characters.
T h e curtains open to a swaying

death on horseback suspended over
James
— Sound
It definitely sounds like James, the
intro sounding slightly like a, 'our
lord above', Carter track. T h e
guitars sound nice, the vocal sounds
like a nice sounding voice, a rather
sound melody and definitely sound
riff flows through this. Sounds good
to me.
O n t'other side is a re-mix of the
ye olde fathfullye ' C o m e H o m e '
that is played only slightly less than
'Sit D o w n ' , the all time bandwagon
song. Re-mixed by Youth (ex o f
Killing Joke, now Blue Pearl) it has
that annoyingly repetitive boom,
boom, drum beat that will make it
a must for all you Hippodrome
cronies.
O h , and there's another sound
track as well.
' W e l l , I think its well sound',
thanks Poddy.
Pebbles
the dying monarch at whom it
points vindictively.
This was an unfamiliar cast who
nonetheless existed effortlessly on
the stage. Gustavus, played by
Richard T a y l o r following a twelve
year absence from the stage, was
subdued vocally by the stronger
characters o f his friend and
betrayer, Anckarstroem (the more
forceful M a l c o l m Donnelly) and
T h e L o r d C h i e f Justice (Terry
Jenkins). However, Taylor's talent
was exposed in the rending aria as
he pleads his fortune from the
deranged and tormented medium,
M a d a m e Arvidson (Linda Finnie).
B o t h L i n d a F i n n i e (as the
medium) and Janice Cairns (as
Amelia) provide the strange and
terrifying women who have control
over the officious and bureaucratic
men. This is Janice Cairns' return
to the stage after seriously injuring
her back having flung herself from
the balcony in Tosca last year. She
proved to be equally emotional
here, giving a most impassioned
performance despite her harsher
voice. Finally, Rosa Mannion,
playing the boy page, Oscar,
excelled in the role V e r d i deemed
most important. H e r pure tones

flitted with agility through the tricky
arias, and still taunted the assassins.
T h e conductor, Graeme Jenkins,
gave a complete performance in
himself, whilst maintaining tight
c o m m a n d o f his stage. T h e
orchestra excelled themselves in
hitherto u n k n o w n d y n a m i c s .
Overall, this is easily the best
complete stage performance I have
attended.
I'll be back!
