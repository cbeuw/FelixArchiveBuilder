want? Descend into the depths on
the largest escalators I've ever seen
(when they work) and you feel you
are not going with the flow either
of people (going in the other
direction) or of the foul smelling
hurricane blowing in your face as
the train you've just missed pulls
out of the station.
The real fun starts in the rush
hour when half of L o n d o n is going
in the other direction and the other
half wants to get onto the same train
that you do (which already contains
the population of several major
European cities). If it's breathing
room only standing on the platform
there are several methods that may
be adopted to get onto the train.
drawbacks; firstly, if someone uses
the same method to get off the train,
things get interesting, and secondly,
you have the cross to bear that
everyone around thinks you have an
IQ of around room temperature.
T h e most popular method is to
wait in the shuffling queue until you
get to the doors of the train and then
shove and force your way in.
The sights that can be seen from
a tube carriage are varied and
interesting (as long as you don't
look out of the windows). Y o u can
see adverts for beer, newspapers,
charities, adult education courses,
as well as poems and other people's
necks, armpits, left eyeballs...Let's
face it, I lied about the interesting
The first is to wait until the doors bit. A n d you haven't got any choice
Doing the Tube
have opened, everyone who wishes
to has disembarked and all those in
front of you have entered the train.
Then politely ask if they might
make room for you. This is very
polite and gives a good impression
to any foreign tourists that may be
around, but if you actually want to
get from A to B you are better off
on a uni-cycle.
T h e second is to force your way
to near the front of the crowd on the
platform before the train arrives and
then heave your way on almost
before the doors have opened.
Anyone who has ever seen a rugger
forward in the U n i o n Bar may
recognise this method. It works
some of the time but has two
because you have to coordinate
your breathing with those around
you and so moving is totally out of
the question.
Finally, I would like to pose a
question. Most stations are in
obvious places; O x f o r d Street,
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square;
places that people want to go to.
W h y is there a station at Hyde Park
Corner? D o people want to go and
sit in the middle o f a large
roundabout? A n d what about Royal
Oak—the middle of a large railway
and canal bridge. Yes, I can see
how that would appeal. A n d why is
there one at South Kensington?

Somehow they maintained a
conversation while scrambling and
running through the darkness.
The Inner System
The London Underground is an
extremely convenient way to get
from A to B in L o n d o n , but to the
unwary it is a minefield of hazards
to be negotiated with skill and
diligence.
One of the first problems often
encountered on a typical tube
journey is find the station. Sounds
obvious? W h e n I first came to
L o n d o n it took me several attempts
to find the actual station at Leicester
Square. There are about fifty-nine
entrances (and they are always on
the other side of the road) with those
welcoming blue signs over them.
W h e n entered, however, they lead
into a bewildering array of tunnels.
People have been known never to
emerge...
Buying a ticket can provide hours
of entertainment. I always seem to
find myself with more 50p coins
than the Bank of England and no
other change. So I join the queue
stretching into the distance towards
the ticket office. If I do have the
'exact money o n l y ' y o u may
guarantee that the person in front of
me in the queue is illiterate and will
spend twenty minutes trying to get
a Zone 6 return, probably without
putting any money in. A n d I never
trust those machines with my £5
notes.
Having purchased a ticket it is
then necessary to run the gauntlet
of the rottweilers—the things with
the flags that chew your ticket up
without letting you through. It's so
embarrassing getting halfway
through and then getting stuck.
N o w which platform do you
Stress struggled in the arms of his
captor shouting incoherently.
'Get away! Get away from it!'
' A w a y from what?'
' A w a y from the robot!'
'What robot?'
Stress stopped fighting, partly
because he realised that there was
no sounds coming from the corridor
like rapping or gunfire and partly
because he realised his captor
holding him tightly was female. A s
he calmed down she let go of him
and he crawled over in the darkness
to the door. There was no sound
from outside. Through a crack
below the gaping hole he could see
that the corridor was empty.
'Where did it go?'
'Where did what go? A l l I heard
was a crash and then I saw you
diving into the r o o m . '
Stress crawled back from the
shattered door to where her dim
shape sat near a small door. He was
coming down from his military
metabolic muscle manager and
could only take orders.
'What do we do now?'
This seemed to spark something
off in her.
' F o l l o w me and you can join in
the plan!'
She motioned him to follow her
through the door. They ran hunched
in near blackness down the tunnel
before it opened out in some sort of
airlock. In the dim red light she
opened the thick door on the far side
of the room and walked through.
Before Stress entered, he tried to
read the large notice by the door but
gave up and carried on, unnerved
by his pale skin and flourescent
striped aluminium jumpsuit glowing
strangely in the light. He was
swallowed up in the darkness of the
tunnel. Behind him the notice
continued reading.

' Y e s , yes I a m . '
' Y o u ' r e a godsend! Y o u can help

E v e n in pitch darkness he
couldn't take his eyes off her.
'I'll do whatever I c a n . '
T h e tunnel sloped up and she
motioned him to slow down. They
crawled to the end where two small
windows floated in the darkness.
She looked through one window
and he looked through the other.
'It's the n e w s r o o m . ' She
whispered.
