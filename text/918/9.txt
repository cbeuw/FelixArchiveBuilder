or educational conferences, so they
don't improve their standards; the
salary is also very low compared to
Israeli teachers and their
economical worries then affect the
quality of teaching.
Contrary to the schools that have
been (at least partially) reopened,
u n i v e r s i t i e s in the o c c u p i e d
territories are still closed (for
'security reasons') and lectures are
held in private homes, sometimes
in hotel rooms, or wherever
possible. There are 5 universities in
the occupied territories, all of them
built and maintained with foreign
money from A r a b countries. W e
visited the university of B i r Zeit,
near Ramallah, built in 1981 and
closed in 1988 after the Intifda. The
students now study in overcrowded
conditions in some of the old
university buildings. Before the
Intifada the students numbered
about 3,500, but then many were
arrested, deported to Jordan, or
even killed, while others dropped
out. N o w there are less than 1,500.
Solidarity and resistance groups
in Israel
W e spent two days in Haifa, in
Israel, a city which used to be
totally Arabic and is still largely
populated by Arabs. Probably
because of the presence of both
Arabs and Israelis, the pacifist
movement there seems politically
more advanced, the analysis of the
situation is more political and less
humanitarian. Here for instance the
' W o m e n in Black', a group of
Israeli women who, since the start
of the Intifada, demonstrate against
the occupation with weekly vigils,
dressed in black as a sign of
mourning, are more politicised than
in other places.
T h e W o m e n in Black regularly
(every Friday) picket the streets of
18 Israeli towns, with their black
banners calling for a withdrawal of
the Israeli army from the occupied
t e r r i t o r i e s , in the name o f
pacification, asking for a stop to the
killing on either side. W e talked to
these women one evening, trying to
understand the reasons for their
stand and the reactions of their
families and friends. That was when
I first realised how difficult it is to
accept different points of view. It
was fine when an Israeli woman
said that next year her son will
reach the age for compulsory
military service and when he was

born she swore that on that date she
would leave the country with him,
and is going to do so. It was more
difficult, though, to understand an
American woman who moved to
Israel only 2-3 years ago, who said
that as an A m e r i c a n Jew she has to
respond to two states: the U S and
Israel, that's why she is in Israel,
supporting the Palestinian cause.
One Israeli woman tried to explain
to us how difficult it must be for a
17-year-old boy to choose between
3 years in the army and 5 years in
jail for conscientious objection. But
then a Palestinian woman from a
refugee camp in the West Bank
answered that often the option of a
17-year-old Palestinian boy is to be
killed or to be tortured by the Israeli
army. It is not an easy dialogue, but
it is important that it exists, and it
is not by chance that the dialogue
is promoted mainly by women.
Both Israeli and Palestinian women
have a c o m m o n ground for their
struggle; violence in the family.
W i t h different m o t i v a t i o n s
(frutstration for the Palestinians,
violence in the army of the Jewish
soldiers), both worlds express their
anger and violence against their
Women's organisations
T h e a i m s o f the W o m e n ' s
Committees (there are 4 groups
which belong to the P L O ) are
manifold: social work consists in
contacting ordinary women for
them to rediscover their traditions;
they gather together, often with the
wives of political prisoners (who
are in need of moral, as well as
e c o n o m i c s u p p o r t ) , to do
embroidery, sew, weave carpets,
e t c . , often o r g a n i s e d in
cooperatives, so that they also get
some economic help; they also run
k i n d e r g a r t e n s and n u r s e r i e s .
Politically they are very active
along with the men, in campaigning
for political prisoners, for more
rights, etc. Culturally, activities
(such as documentation centres for
women) help the creation of a new,
emancipated, political woman, an
a c a d e m i c , intellectual leader.
Something that seems to be a
common characteristic (we noticed
it talking to women in Jerusalem,
Beit Sahur, Nablus, Hebron, etc) is
the awareness of the mistakes made
by other A r a b anticolonialist
movements (the Algerian, above
all), where women's issues were
ignored during the national struggle
and their lives were left unaltered
after independence. The Palestinian
women are aware of these errors
and don't want to repeat them:
whereas the ordinary women might
have gone back home, this hard-
core group of A r a b feminists have
already left too strong a mark to be
simply wiped away.
