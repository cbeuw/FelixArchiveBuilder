Rector Questioned
O n Thursday the Rector, Sir Eric
A s h was questioned by a mixed
. student and staff a u d i e n c e
numbering around 60. A l s o in
attendance were Angus Fraser,
C o l l e g e M a n a g i n g D i r e c t o r ,
G o r d o n M a r s h a l l , Director of
Estates, John Archer, College Pro-
Rector and Steven N e w b o l d ,
Director of Marketing.
Q u e s t i o n i n g started on the
financial stability of the College.
This was described as 'stable' by
the Rector, but he added that the
reserves w e r e ' z i l c h ' . T h e
replacement of present Security
staff with outside contractors was
described as part of the continuing
effort to run College in a more cost
effective manner.
The Rector believed that the
number of university students
nationwide needed to be increased,
but that this could not happen with
'the generous U K maintenance
terms'. He felt that a 'better way
was a graduate tax', but he
disapproved of any system that led
to students being forced to live at
home. H e said that 'within some
limits a certain amount of working
through College is acceptable',
citing the U S A as an example. H e
described students' summer benefits
as 'diabolical.'
T h e Rector was asked why the
College ignored student's views on
the extension of the College Day.
H e responded T don't think it d i d '
and criticised last year's referendum
as a 'would-you-like-to-get-up-
earlier' question. H e claimed that
the longer day would use resources
more efficiently and although all
University of L o n d o n colleges
would soon start at 9.00am, h e '
could foresee '8.00am lectures by
the year 2000.'
He said that there would be more
academic staff on outside contracts
in College, but he refused to be
drawn on the matter of security
staff. H e would not pass the
question on to the members of the
m a n a g e m e n t staff who were
present, saying that this session was
the Rector's Question time.
The question-time ended with the
I C U President, Zoe Hellinger,
flanning the Rector for Rag. While
preparing for the event, she was
heard to say T am going to take
great pleasure in this.'
Motion
A n E G M (Extraordinary General
Meeting of the Student Union) has
been called on Thursday November
28 in Mechanical Engineering 220
at f.OOpm to discuss the changes to
the College day. In addition, there
w i l l be three m o t i o n s ; that
sabbaticals s h o u l d w e a r
T h u n d e r b i r d costumes, that a
women's group should be set up,
and that Imperial College should
reaffiliate to the National U n i o n of
Students. This would involve a
college-wide referendum.
Unions Move
S t a f f m e m b e r s o f the
Manufacturing Science and Finance
Trade Union ( M S F ) at Imperial
College will be taking industrial
action on Wednesday 4 December,
in protest at the recent decision to
contract out the work of the
messengers and security guards to
a private company.
T h e decision to strike was taken
by an M S F meeting yesterday after
a strike ballot which gave 63 per
cent support for industrial action.
Other unions have also reacted to
the move by high level College
personnel. N U P E (the National
U n i o n for Public E m p l o y e e s )
released a provisional result of 80
per cent support for strike action,
from a poll of their members earlier
this week. In a newsletter produced
this week, the A U T (Association of
University Teachers) has instructed
members not to cross picket lines
or to do work meant for other staff.
D r . T a y l o r Russell of the A U T
expressed 'horror and incredulity'
at the management action. T h e
A U T action was described as
'extraordinary' by Derek Dollard,
President o f M S F , at a meeting o f
his union yesterday. M r Dollard
said that the A U T had never
supported a strike in College
before.
The M S F strike will take place on
the same day as a meeting o f the
G o v e r n i n g B o d y o f I m p e r i a l
College, in order to lobby opinion
in the meeting against the cuts. A
member of the M S F commented
that students attending lectures on
the 4th D e c e m b e r w o u l d be
crossing picket lines.
