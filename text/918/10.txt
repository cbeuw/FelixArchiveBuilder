The Sailing Jet Sea Cup
One of the most prestigious French
universities, Sup de Co-Rouen, had
a brilliant idea of filling Easter
vacations with an international
regatta in the Caribbean seas: the
Jet Sea C u p . T h e first regatta (13th
to 20th A p r i l '91) was a race
between Point a Pitre and Antigua.
This years regatta (28th M a r c h to
5th A p r i l '92) will run around the
island of Dominica.
Dominica is the largest of the
Lesser Antilles Islands and lies
between the two French islands of
M a r t i n i q u e and G u a d a l u p e .
Ruggedly beautiful and volcanic in
o r i g i n , D o m i n i c a offers an
i n c o m p a r a b l e o p p o r t u n i t y to
experience one of the last spots on
Earth, where nature's unchanged
and unspoiled, both on land and in
the sea.
Sailing teams, made up of seven
'entrepreneurial' persons (students,
company representatives or both),
command the same type of boat:
Centurions 47. This makes the
'playing field' level and gives
greater competitiveness to the
racing. D a y and night events
comprise in a series of off-shore
races and O l y m p i c triangles lasting
seven days, during which team
spirit, enthusiasm, quick decision
making and technical skills will
select a winning team.
T h e aim of this event is to enable
students from European institutions
to promote their Universities and
their sponsors. It's also a chance to
meet executives from international
c o m p a n i e s and d i s c u s s the
opportunities of summer internships
and possible future careers.
T h e Jet Sea C u p is widely
covered by the media: a group of
journalists will follow the race day
by day on a Centurion 59. M e d i a
represented so far include ' L e
F i g a r o ' , ' V S D ' , ' F R 3 ' , ' L e s
E c h o s ' , 'Cosmopolitan', 'France
A n t i l l e s ' , ' Y a c h t C l u b
I n t e r n a t i o n a l ' and ' N e p t u n e
Yachting'. It's therefore a great
opportunity for companies seeking
international r e c o g n i t i o n and
wishing to promote themselves to
their potential employees, clients
and investors. Moet et Chandon
public relations attache used to say
on International Student Regattas:
" T h e s e are the future directors of
companies. These are the people
who will buy our champagne."

Dribblers Win Again
T h e Dribblers, already headed for
the double in the League and C u p ,
made a storming start in the U A U
last Saturday with an excellent 9-3
victory over Brunei. Brunei, with
a very strong side, just didn't know
what hit them (although IC did and
it was generally boots in the shins,
elbows in the face, digs in the ribs,
kicks to the ankles etc etc).
Although the game was closely
fought from start to finish it was IC
who had the finishing power. Jo,
who has been in stunning form all
season, scored a great goal in the
first half, with the remaining goals
coming from Permi (7) and Lisa,
who got her much deserved first
goal for the team.
T h i s was the best o v e r a l l
performance by the Dribblers to
date and arguably the toughest game
they have played in all season.
H o w e v e r , true to f o r m , the
Dribblers didn't let the game
interfere with the main contest of
the day, the customary boat race,
which the Dribblers won in style.
(But it could all have been so
different had Ethel not been too
tired to take part in the race...)
Eight hundred years ago, in a
particularly dark forest in deepest
medieval England, there lived a
super hero, a man so remarkable
that his name and his story became
the stuff of legend for centuries to
come. His name was Robin of
Locksley and his story went on to
be retold in numerous motion
pictures. T h e latest, Robin H o o d ,
Prince of Thieves, will be shown by
F i l m S o c this coming Thursday.
T h e f i l m is a ' l o o s e '
interpretation of the outlaw legend,
with a star studded cast led by
K e v i n Costnor. Robin returns from
the crusades to find the evil Sheriff
of Nottingham ruling all that he
once owned. Not to be outdone he
flees to the forest to gather a band
of rogues to steal from the rich and
give to the poor and generally upset
the Sheriff. So good at his job is our
Robin, that the Sheriff kidnaps his
only true love, M a i d M a r i a n , and
whisks her away to his castle. A l l
is the set for the ultimate
confrontation between good and
evil.
T h e film has done so well in
Britain that it has managed to gross
more than £17 million, surpassing

T h e film will be shown in M e c h

November at 7.30pm. Admission
will be 80p for members and £1.80
for non-members. Membership is

syndicate wants to represent
Imperial College and promote it as
a top European Institution of
Science, Engineering and Business
to potential future students. T h e
'internationality' o f this syndicate
(three French, two Britons, one
Australian and one Italian) perfectly
matches with this purpose.
In addition to its traditional

'enlarge' its present budget. So if
