M a t (vocals) a n d H a m i s h (bass),
together with N i c k (drums), who
were out to buy some new jeans, are
Revolver. M a t and N i c k had been
in various groups in Winchester,
but felt they were going nowhere.
It was decided that a move to
L o n d o n was called for. Once there
a demo tape was sent to a friend o f
Hamish's, Hamish liked it, they met
up and Revolver were born.
Crimson is only their second
single release and continues the
development of the 45 ep. But why
Hut records?
'There was a guy at one of our
gigs with a stupid smile on his face',
replied Hamish, the quiet one of the
pair. He was really getting into the
music, and kept smiling at Hamish
as he played the bass. They had no
idea he was f r o m a r e c o r d
company, and in fact were intending
to sign to another label at the time.
After the gig he approached them
and spouted out how great it had
been, what a fantastic group they
were and, who were they going to
sign to? T didn't want to say
anything, in case he was from a
record company', continued M a t .
One thing lead to another and they
signed to Hut.
They both said how great it was
to be looked after by somebody that
liked everything they did, not
automatically but because they
actually liked it. The one time it was
thought that a track needed re-
mixing so did the band. T still think
the drums should be louder' added
Mat.
Asked what they thought about
the current music scene they
responded with two points.
Firstly, the way people are so
protective about the whole 'indie'
thing, the way people say you can't
have creative freedom inside a
major label. It's like when people
complained when Carter moved to
Chrysalis from Bad Cat people said
they'd sold out. N o band has moved
to a major label and suddenly turn
crap, changed their clothes. T h e
whole music scene is becoming too
compartmentalised, people feel like
they have to be protective about
their music.
Secondly, the way that 'indie'
women dress. 'They always wear
clumpy boots', I offered. ' Y e s , and
flowery dresses'. Not the most
attractive people in the world it
must be said.
A n d then I died up, floundering
like a whale on the beach I resorted
to something I had promised my self
I wouldn't, ' T h e Scene'. Sorry.
'We don't talk about it apart from
in interviews'. Let's get one thing
straight, they don't sound anything
like Moose, their label-mates,
Chapterhouse don't sound like
Moose or Revolver, they're all
different. When out and about it
would be stupid of them to ignore
a friend now that they are in a group
themselves, wouldn't it? â€¢
'The guitar styles are completely
different'. This is obvious to even
the most casual listener to Crimson
or the 45 ep. T h e four tracks that
make up the ep are varied in style,
yet they still remain neatly bounded
into a complete whole. Its a great
record, almost a mini album.
I asked them if they had changed
during their short life together?
'Every time we play we try and
make things a little different', they
answered. Sometimes they even
change the words. Does anybody
notice I wondered, or only the
members of the group. F o r the rest
of the song M a t is half singing, half
laughing the lyrics.
'With the first ep we had four
tracks and know exactly what we
wanted to do with them', M a t
continued, 'but with this one we
only had one and a h a l f . T h e other
two were made up in the studio and
are perhaps the best tracks on the
record.
' Y o u ' v e got this reputation for
being arrogant, do you think you
deserve it?'
Their response was to ask why,
who had told me? I couldn't really
answer, it was more a feeling, a
general vibe, nothing specific. They
are young and enthusiastic, its very
easy to mistake that for arrogance,
especially if you want to. Take the
Manic Street Preacher (please) now
they are arrogant for no reason at
all. Revolver don't say they've
produced the best records ever, or
even o f this year, but see them as
a start, a beginning to start from.
It may be a long road but when they
reach the end the results will be
more than worth it.
C o m p l e t e l y running out o f
questions I asked them 'have y o u
anything else to say?'
'Both of us have blue eyes'
