Introduction
I participated in a two-week tour of
the occupied territories and Israel
organised by an Italian pacifist
organisation. I was one of seventeen
women. T h e aim of the tour was to
visit these 'difficult' places, and
worked by an Israeli, they have no
insurance, no health assistance, no
p e n s i o n and i f they injure
themselves in the working place
they even risk losing their jobs. A
Palestinian female worker has one
month maternity leave, while an

meet the people, especially women,
who are fighting against the Israeli
oppression both in the occupied
territories and Israel.
There are approximately two
million Palestinians living in the
occupied territories of West Bank
and Gaza strip, almost half of them
are refugees from 1948 registered
with the U N R W A (United Nations
Relief and Works Agency).
Workers
Besides some small Palestinian
firms and cooperatives of women
(producing things like biscuits,
yogurt, carpets, embroidery) the
majority of Palestinians either work
in agriculture, are unemployed or
work in Israel. U p to 1990 most of
the Palestinian workers were
allowed to travel to Israel, although
they were not officially permitted
to stay there overnight. Some of
them used to be locked up at night
by their employers, instead of daily
commuting from the West Bank,
whilst only a minority were given
a green card that forbade them to
enter Israel.
T h e P a l e s t i n i a n s f r o m the
occupied territories who work in
Israel do not have the same rights
as their Israeli fellows: even though
they pay the same taxes, and work
46 hours against the 40 hours
Israeli female worker gets three
months.
M e a n w h i l e , the bureaucracy
makes *it very difficult to obtain
permission to open a firm in the
occupied territories, and it is not
possible for a Palestinian, not even
for farmers, to trade directly with
other states (for instance Arab states
or Europe) without passing through
Israel. They cannot even sell their
goods to Israel, unless they are
officially required by Israel itself,
and in that case it is Israel that fixes
the price. The farmers have not
much choice: either the poor
internal market or Israel.
Land confiscation
A n o t h e r p r o b l e m that the
Palestinian farmers face is the land
confiscation, in order to make room
for new settlements. This happens
both in the occupied territories and
in Israel.
W e learned that there are 122
illegal Arab villages in Israel, a total
of 75,000 people who live in places
that are not recognised by the state.
There is no one Arab village where
there has not been l a n d
expropriation.
Schools and universities
Education is another sector where
Palestinians have experienced
strong repression from the Israeli
state. Schools in the occupied
territories are divided into three
types: U N R W A , private and
government schools.
U N R W A schools are specifically
for the refugee camps. T h e y
provide primary education for
everybody, although it is very
difficult for a student from a refugee
camp to continue into secondary
school.
Private schools are run by
religious organisations (Muslim or
Christian) or by other organisations
(for example Women's Committees
run most of the nursery schools).
Some of the private schools are run
by the P L O , under the cover of
religious schools (the P L O is
banned and belonging to or coming
in contact with the organisation
means six months to 15 years in
jail). They get the money to run
their schools from Jordan. After the
1967 occupation Israel wanted to
enforce an Israeli syllabus, but
teachers refused. U p to now they
teach a Jordain syllabus in the West
Bank and an Egyptian syllabus in
the Gaza strip. One role of the
General U n i o n o f Palestinian
Teachers ( G U P T ) , among others, is
to train teachers to defy censorship.
In fact, in the occupied territories
2,200 books are banned (from
Shakespeare's Hamlet, to those of
the Brazilian Jorge A m a d o and all
Palestinian writers and poets),
although these same books are sold
in Israel. Possession of illegal
literature means up to six months in
jail, 'but the biggest loss', said one
teacher, a leader of the G U P T in
Jerusalem, 'are the books they took
away from us'.
Government schools make up
more than 7 0 % of the schools on
the West B a n k . T h e biggest
problem is caused by the current
closure of schools (last year they
taught from between 40 to 110
days, out of the ordinary 240 days),
and the imprisonment or dismissal
of teachers. T h e government tend
to employ temporary teachers, who
are more vulnerable and more
easily c o n t r o l l e d . A l t h o u g h
Palestinian education standards
have always been considered higher
than any other A r a b state
(Palestinians have the highest of
graduate students among all the
Arab countries), several factors are
contributing to the lowering of those
standards: at the beginning of the
Intifada all schools were closed for
18 months, and after the first 3
months of underground teaching a
new law made even this illegal and
teachers risked between 6 months
to 10 years of prison; teachers in
government schools are not allowed
to belong to the Union or attend
various events, like training courses
