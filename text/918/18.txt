There's a 2am bar extension if you
can't bear to watch the acts.
T o m o r r o w there's the sponsored
Nude Kamikaze Parachute Jump.
So if you want to see myself and
Paul Thomas (Maths II) streaking
naked from Harrods three legged,
:ome and watch (and give us some
money).
Next week it's back to normal.
There's a live band doing their thing
in the Lounge Bar on Monday
night. There is a Muller draft lager
promotion too (£1 a bottle) on
Monday night. Wednesday is teaser
time again with a bar quiz followed
by disco. Cocktails are available on
Thursday at the Red Zone in the
Lounge Bar. So if you're pissed off
(or pissed) with beer try one of
these instead.
Friday night is Ents Night as
usual with a midnight bar extension.

front, there's a sport sale on

Extraordinary General Meeting is
in M e c h E n g 220 at l p m on
Thursday. So come and quiz the
sabbaticals and other officers and
have a say in union business. If you
don't then we can only assume that
we are doing a storming job or you
are deserving of one of Rag's
babble cards but are too shy to even
babble.
Finally, if anyone wants to earn
£30 on December 11 by helping
C a m e r a - 7 at the g r a d u a t i o n
