Whoever it was from the Overseas
Students Committee who booked a
full page, and then came in o n
Tuesday saying that they didn't
want it and did it matter, will come
to the Felix office and beg for their
life. O t h e r w i s e u n s p e a k a b l y
horrible things will come to pass.
Yes it does matter. Quite a lot, and
if it hadn't been for a last minute
reshuffle o f the pages the O S C
would have got a full page saying
The Overseas Students Committee
are paying £60 for this.
Cowardly Letters
A n d also, to whoever handed in a
letter last week purportedly from
M r Schaeffer, i f I find out who you
are I shall ensure everbody else
knows, particularly the real M r
Schaeffer. This is an appallingly
cowardly thing to do, and it isn't
remotely clever as up until now I
have not thought it necessary to
check the identities o f the authors,
mainly because names will be
withheld if required. A s of now, all
people should bring some form o f
identity when delivering a letter or
an article for publication in Felix.
I a m not willing to put up with
criticism for the malice o f others.
Mindless Vandalism
W h o are these people? T h e new
sign on the central staircase o f the
U n i o n building has been seriously
damaged - it cost about £600 to put
up - by students trying to remove
it. This sign is there to help people
find their way around the U n i o n
building. It is not a decoration.
L i k e w i s e the m i r r o r o n the
photobooth. I a m sure that the

people responsible object to being
treated like particularly destructive
children, so why do they behave so?
During the recent R a g week
events in the U n i o n Building, the
relevant C C U s were to provide
additional security personnel to aid
the duty officers supplied by I C U .
In the case of the Guilds Carnival,
most o f these additional and very
necessary helpers were totally
drunk early in the evening. In the
case of the Mines Dirty Disco few,
if any, turned up. Security at such
events cannot be ensured i f such
promised help is lacking.
More Mascotry
Last Weekend, a group o f sad
individuals known as ex R C S U
hacks stole the R C S U mascot,
Theta, from the present R C S U
students. A s far as I can gather, the
present R C S U people behaved in a
surprisingly responsible manner by
giving Theta up to prevent violence.
W h y did the ex R C S U hacks do
this? Because they didn't want it to
conform to the new mascotry rules.
This is an arrogant, ignorant,
p a t r o n i s i n g a n d c r i m i n a l l y
irresponsible act, particularly in
light of the recent serious accident
that o c c u r e d with respect to
mascotry. T h e present students
ought to decide what rules the
C C U s conform to, as they are the
ones w h o have first hand
information o f what the present
situation is. O l d R C S U people
behaving in such an overbearing
manner is notionally the same as an
overweaning grandfather dictating
what his children's children should
do. It's pathetic in both the old and
new senses o f the word. T h e o l d
R C S U people involved in this
should go away and get themselves
a life.
For a slightly less venomous
opinion, you can refer to Angie
Creissen's letter on page 4 and the
news article o n the front or back
pages.
Records
Der Musikfuhrer, David Spooner,
has not regained his snaffled
records yet. Please return them to
the Felix Office as the vampire
himself is beginning to scent blood.
It is outrageous to steal such
personal items from somebody who
quite evidently doesn't have the
money to replace them.
