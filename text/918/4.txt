State Terror Won't Let Go
Dear Adam,
Referring to last week's letter by
Gaby Pell protesting against the
participation o f a member o f the
PLO in a meeting of the A n t i - W a r
in the G u l f Society, we would like
to raise the following points.
First, a reminder that the P L O
represents at least 7 0 % o f the
Palestinians in a recent survey and
as such they cannot be denied their
rightful place in any such meetings.
So long as the Palestinians have no
rights to vote for the people they
want in the occupied territories, the
PLO has to be taken as their
representative.
Secondly, any terrorist act is
d e p l o r a b l e a n d s h o u l d be
condemned. However, the present
violence is being committed by both
sides. There have been more
Palestinians killed over the past
three years than Israelis killed. If
anything, it is the state o f Israel
which should renounce violence and
state terror against u n a r m e d
P a l e s t i n i a n c i v i l i a n s . T h e
restoration of a Palestinian state is
o n l y r i g h t , c o n s i d e r i n g t h e
horrendous injustices of the past ten
years.
Thirdly, in any useful discussion
there must be voices from all
opinions. T r y i n g to exclude a
member o f the P L O from the
meeting would make complete
nonsense o f the very claim that
Imperial College is 'apolitical'. W e
suspect that Gaby Pell's definition
of being 'apolitical' is plucked right
out o f Israeli government policy,
which is to ignore and exclude the
PLO from any peace process/
discussion.
Finally, Imperial College must
continue to let all shades of political
opinions flourish.
Yours sincerely,
Ho Yin Wong, Physics PG,

Dear Editor,
I find the theoretical Physics
c o u r s e s rather l i k e l e a r n i n g
Portuguese from an instructor who
speaks only Portuguese. By the time
you have picked up enough o f the
language to understand him at all,
you realise he is so far ahead of you
that you will never catch up.
You c a n ' t e v e n ask h i m
questions, such as the meaning o f
a simple word. H e will describe it
in terms of more difficult words and
phrases, that you can't learned until
you have learnt the simple ones.
Perhaps, in view of the symbols
used, I should have said not
Portuguese but Greek!
Yours sincerely,
Peter Taylor.
Dear Adam,
The mascotry rules were changed
recently to make this tradition raise
more money for Rag and involve
more people. A group of e x - R C S U
students objected to this change as
the new rules meant that the mascot,
previously unviolated for seventeen
years would almost certainly be
stolen during Rag Week.
T h e y are no longer involved i n
the running of R C S U and certainly
don't give a toss about current
students, so they resorted to
bullying tactics to get their own
way. N o wonder the R C S U has
such a crap image with people like
that hanging around.
Dear Editor,
Sex is legal at twelve. Drinking
is legal at sixteen. A l c o h o l is sold
at all hours. Cannabis is legal.
Dutch law, whether right or wrong,
sounds brilliant.
All the things that would make
many Imperial College students
smile. T h e difference is that in
E n g l a n d : ' C l a s s B drugs e g .
amphetamines, barbiturates and
cannabis, depending on whether it's
p o s s e s s i o n o r s u p p l y a n d
production, can give you anything
from a three month prison sentence
and/or a £500 fine to five years
and/or an unlimited fine'. Y o u will
also get a criminal record, thrown
The current officers do want to
make R C S U more relevant and
useful to students. H o w e v e r ,
previous years o f cliqueyness and
the influence of old boys who won't
let go can't be broken through that
easily. W e ' r e tyring our best but
believe it o r not we're also trying
to get good degrees as well, so we
simply don't have time to put it all
right straight away. Slaggings-off
from uninformed people don't help,
but I ' m a l l f o r constructive
criticism. W e ' d like things to
change as much as you would.
