whatever language, generally refers
to a group of characters which
expresses the human thoughts, but
never has it received the status of
being an art as in China.
It is generally thought that the
history of Chinese calligraphy is as
old as the history of China itself.
Although westerners know a lot
about Chinese painting and other
fine arts, they have a very vague
idea about the nature of Chinese
calligraphy. In addition, not only is
Chinese calligraphy the essential
form of all Chinese art, it is the
most basic element from which
Chinese art originates. Unfor-
tunately, however, unless one is
brought up in the tradition and
influence of Chinese art, it is almost
impossible to learn and master
Chinese calligraphy. In order to
understand Chinese calligraphy,
one has to learn the history of the
formation of some characters, as
well as acquiring the ability to write
them. This is because the ways the
characters are written not only
communicate and exchange ideas
with the calligrapher (and indeed
everyone), but also convey an
aesthetic element, usually abstract,
through visual perception.
The relationship between Chinese
calligraphy and the daily lives of the
Chinese people is inseparable.
Walking in the streets in this
country, one notices that most of the
calligraphy on the signboards of
advertisements seems to be similar
in style: they are neat, regular and
balanced, but also, h o w e v e r ,
lacking in dynamism. By contrast,
in areas w h e r e there is an
accumulation of Chinese shops,
calligraphy can be seen displayed
e v e r y w h e r e . A p a r t f r o m the
signboards, one finds that the
interior of almost every restaurant,
business centre and shop is adorned
with examples of calligraphy work.
These characters have three main
values: their decorative quality,
advertising capabilities and most
importantly, their attractiveness to
the appreciative audience.
A passion and love for the written
word has long been Cultivated in the
soul of every Chinese youngster.
T h e education that they received
teaches them not to tear up any
written work and not to use
improper writing-paper, not even a
piece of waste paper. In fact, in
every region of China, even the
poorest village, towers and pagodas
are built specially for burning
written examples of calligraphy in
a r e s p e c t f u l m a n n e r . T h e
Westerners find this hard to
comprehend. T h e tradition shows
clearly the degree of respect in
which the Chinese hold the written
word.
A s most businessmen will tell
you, a well written signboard can
b r i n g l u c k and fortune.
Consequently, they are very willing
to pay a large sum of money in
exchange for a fine piece of work.
Once the name of the shop has
finished being written, a grand
ceremony will be held before the
shop sign is put in the final position.
T h e C h i n e s e b e l i e v e that
personality, disposition, tempera-
ment, hobbies and even the degree
of success of a person can be told
from their calligraphy. For example
one can imply from the works of
Emperor H u i Z o n g of the Sung
Dynasty (AD960-1297) that he was
h a n d s o m e , tall and s l i m in
appearance, but also irresolute.
During the long years between
the T a n g and Q i n g D y n a s t y
(AD618-1919), Imperial examina-
tions (usually set on the Confucian
doctrines) was the only way by
which one can embark on an official
career. F r o m this point of view,
calligraphy is not only the most
basic but also the most important
requirement. N o scholar would
have been awarded a job, not even
the most magnificent essay writer,
had calligraphy been 'not good
enough'. E v e n nowadays, the
ability to write aesthetically pleasing
calligraphy plays an important role
in one's social life. E q u a l l y
remarkable to the Westerner may be
the fact that a lot of the friendship
is built simply on the basis of
d i s t i n g u i s h e d h a n d w r i t i n g -
reflecting the degree of admiration
one shows to people who are
talented in c a l l i g r a p h y ! If a
C h i n a m a n c a n n o t write his
characters well, no doubt he will
find it very difficult to find a job,
even in the era of the invention of
Chinese computer.
In China, calligraphy is the most
c o m m o n of art forms. It is a
nationwide hobby, a kind of
'natural appreciation of beauty',
which is cultivated in every child in
the ' L a n d of Gods'. At certain
stages in China's history, many
scholars have become 'fanatic'
about Chinese calligraphy, much
more so than about drawing, for
example, Scholars experted in the
disciplines of art, song, poetry were
not commonly found throughout
China's history, whereas elegant
and brilliant calligraphers could be
found everywhere and at any time
in the history of China. M o s t
literature and art, however, they
find a sense o f satisfaction when
they look at a fine example of the
art of calligraphy.
If this is the case with you, why
don't you have a go yourself?
A live demonstration of Chinese
calligraphy will be presented at
'Malaysian Variety Show', 22nd
F e b r u a r y 1992. E v e r y o n e is
welcome.
