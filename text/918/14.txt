Proof Martin's cleaning lady and A n a y a
friend he makes during the course
of the film'. Out o f these three
people, an eternal triangle is
formed.
Celia loves Martin, almost to the
point of worship, staying with h i m
despite his callous treatment of her.
Martin needs A n d y , as the only
person he trusts, trusting h i m
absolutely. A n d y lusts after and
falls in love with Celia.
A d d e d to this complexity is
Martin's fanatical devotion to the
truth; nobody must lie to him about
what they see, as they are his eyes.
His world falls apart when Celia
blackmails A n d y into lying to
Martin, and the triangle breaks.
Cinematographically, the film
could be far better. Proof is visibly
l o w budget, w i t h b l a n d ,
uninteresting camerawork. Acting
is reasonable, with adequate
p e r f o r m a n c e s f r o m a l l but
G e n e v i e v e P i c o t w h o was
outstanding. H e r ability and the
excellent writing and direction of
Jocelyn Moorhouse makes the film
worthwhile. H e r insight into human
nature is w o n d e r f u l a n d the
characters are given true depth. She
has also managed to fill the film
with blind humour - jokes against
the sighted - and beautiful insights
into the life of the blind.
This film has inspired me to the
extent that I went blind for 24 hours
during R a g Week. If you think that
I was being a little extreme, then tell
me so, but see Proof first. Proof
will be on limited release from the
29th November.
S t e f .
Martin (Hugo Weaving) was born
with a chip on his shoulder. W h e n
his mother used to describe a scene
to h i m , he would challenge her,
telling her that she was lying. When
she questioned h i m as to why she
would lie, the angry response would
be 'Because y o u can'.
The truth was that she could have
lied to h i m . Martin could never
verify what his mother told h i m
about the things she saw, for one
simple reason. H e was blind.
Martin started carrying a camera
around with him, so that he could
photograph the things that he heard
and smelt, as ' p r o o f to those who
could see.
Interwoven with this insecure and
angry character are two other
people. Celia (Genevieve Picot) and
A n d y (Russell Crowe). Celia is

' K 2 ' is the film based on the T o n y
award-winning stageplay of the
same name by Patrick Meyers. It
has all the essential conflicts to
make up an enthralling adventure
epic, man vs. man, man vs nature,
man vs himself. Somehow,in the
transformation from stage to screen
it lost some of the spark.
It centres on two men who are
climbing what is possibly the Most
Dangerous Mountains in the World,
the Karakoram Mountain Range,
K 2 for short. They face all the life-
t h r e a t e n i n g dangers o f the
mountains, and find out much about
themselves along the way. Michael
Biehn plays obnoxious Attorney
Taylor Brooks who lives for risks,
in the courtroom, in bed, and most
especially on the mountains. H e
says at the very beginning of the
play that' Y a gotta keep taking risks
in this life. Y o u stop taking risks,
you're dead.' H i s friend Harold
Jaimeson, played by Matt Craven,
is at the other end o f the spectrum.
H e is a physicist who takes both his
work and his family very seriously.
H e is however just as addicted to
climbing mountains as Taylor is,
but for c o m p l e t e l y different
reasons. H e is the epitome o f the
person who scales a mountain to be
'closer to god'. A s he asserts there
is that split moment right when you
get to the top of the mountain in
which all the answers become clear,
and just as soon afterwards the
worldly concerns come crashing
down a n d its time to climb back
down into it. However this split
second is extremely addictive, and
he keeps climbing. The addiction is
about the only thing that these two
men have in common. G i v e n the
opportunity to climb this mountain
is something each o f them had
dreamed of, but never expected to
happen. W h e n it does, they jump at
the chance.
T h e joys of the film are the
climbing sequences with spectacular
cinematography, and nail-biting
scenes of literally cliff-hanging
danger. However, it may rely too
much on this part and neglect that
the f i l m is s u p p o s e d to be
'character-driven' and an analysis
of the relationships involved. T h e
acting is mediocre, which can't
happen with a script as stilted as this
one without a loss o f sympathy on
the part of the audience for the
characters. However, there is one
actress that is a b s o l u t e l y
magnificent in her splendour, that
is the mountain. A n d if y o u want
your breath taken away by the cruel
beauty of nature then definitely see
it in the theatre, otherwise, wait
until it's out on video.

H i Reader peoples! D o any o f you
know where our 'Theatre Editors'

If they float past then send them
over on a Wednesday afternoon. If
anyone sees Winona Ryder then
send her over on a Wednesday
afternoon. If y o u see anyone
interesting then send them over on
a Wednesday afternoon. W e like to
meet new and exciting people even
though we're xenophobic and hide
u n d e r the desk.
