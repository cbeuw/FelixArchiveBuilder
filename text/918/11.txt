Jumping Out of the Sky chess
Saturday 26th October saw the
parachute C l u b descend (pun
intended) on Peterborough for the
first beginners training weekend of
the year.
After the day was spent on
learning how to avoid breaking a
leg, Saturday was finished off with
a trip Downtown Peterborough to
hit the happening nightlife^ This
being crap, we just had a pizza and
headed back to the airfield bar to
nurse our weary bones and gain
courage for the next day.
Sunday morning saw the land
training finished with the afternoon
set for jumping. After waiting and
worrying, 22 of us willingly jumped
from 2000 feet! With 22 still left
intact, with no bones askew, we all
went back to the bar,to boast of our
courageous exploits.
Since then we have been back to
repeat our feats of valour, a few of
us reaching the lofty position
(another pun) of second level
jumpers - all this involves is
pretending to open your canopy
(tech speak for parachute).
If anyone is interested in joining
our elite company, come along to
any Parachute meeting (12.30 on
Mondays in the B r o w n Committee
Room) or contact one of us.

The son of F l y I starts experiencing
the same changes his father went
through (no, not puberty). Y e p , he
starts exhibiting strange table
manners (making IC students look
half civilized).
A s well as being a scientist he is
also a specimen for study. E r i c
Stolz plays the thing with compound
eyes, his anger and frustration
growing into a fierce battle to
become totally human (bit like the
Chair-entity really).
£1 entrance for members and
£2.50 to non-members (includes
membership).
Football
IC were knocked out of the L U C u p
due to the lack of commitment that
has been apparent throughout the
season. R Snell (man of the match)
scored from a set piece corner with
the only part of his anatomy that he
ever uses, his head. U C equalised
immediately and went on to take the
lead just after half time. IC's
version of David Piatt, club captain
D a v i d B u c k l e , c o m p l e t e d an
outstanding game. Scoring from an
A Matuni cross to put IC on level
pegging. This saw the end of IC
with U C scoring a further two goals
to win 4-2.
Last M o n d a y saw T h e Mestel
Challenge, a simultaneous match
play against the former British
Chess C h a m p i o n . T h e challenge
was played over 16 boards with the
following results obtained by D r
Mestel (playing white):
W o n 12, D r a w n 3, Lost 1; hence
scoring 13 and a half points out of
a possible 16.
The notable win was achieved by
a guest player - the secretary of the
Middlesex League, Bruce Birchall.
He had appeared to have lost his
queen, but soon displayed that it
was a cunning plan to force the
white king to the centre of the board
to be mated.
Ben Turner, the former V P of
I C U , played with remarkable flair
and was two pawns up in the
endgame with wonderful winning
chances. But the 2520 E L O - r a t e d
grandmaster delved into the depth
of his experience to salvage a draw.
Another possible winner was
T o n y L e e (Physics III), a Chess
Club veteran. H e had 2 pieces
against the rook in the endgame.
H o w e v e r he elected for the
dignified draw after witnessing the
demolition and carnage around him.
Finally a notable draw was
achieved by D r Karoll Seikiw of
C h e m i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g . H e
employed a vast number of tricks
and a great deal of guile to force a
perpetual check on the white king.
T h e challenge was a good
advertisement for the game and the
Chess Club would like to extend its
thanks to D r Mestel for making the
event such a success. L o o k i n g
ahead, there is an away match on
M o n d a y 25 N o v , against Kings
Head II, with the Chess C l u b
gathering as usual in the B r o w n
Committee R o o m on Wednesdays
at 7pm.
