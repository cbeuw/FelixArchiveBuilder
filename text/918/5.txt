The Other Side of the Gulf
Dear Editor,
A s chair of the meeting organised
by the Anti-War in the G u l f Society
on the 7th November, I feel I should
respond to the letter from Gaby Pell
in last w e e k ' s F e l i x (15th
November), and defend the rights
of any society within the U n i o n to
invite whomever they wish in order
to create debate w i t h i n this
University. Gaby is correct in
stating that I C U is apolitical,
however, apolitical does not mean
non-political, it merely means that
the U n i o n does not take any
particular stance on political issues.
This stance should not be used to
discourage debate within the U n i o n
on important current issues, no
matter how controversial. In all
fairness to the U n i o n , I know of no
cases where it has banned speakers
in recent years, a policy I hope it
continues to enact (as long as the
U n i o n is not committing a criminal
offence).
In the case of the above meeting
I C A W I G S decided to hold a debate
on Palestine. W e took the decision
to invite a member of the deputy
director of the London office of the
P L O , Bassem A l Jamal, for two
reasons. Firstly, the P L O had not
been given a direct voice at the
M a d r i d conference, but most
i m p o r t a n t l y they are the
organisation with the support of the
overwhelming majority o f the
Palestinian people. W e also invited
John Gee from the Palestinian
Solidarity G r o u p . Nobody felt
threathened in any way. Bassem
spoke optimistically about the future
for Palestine and peace in the
region. I heard no mention of
detroying the Jewish state and
killing all Jews. In fact he spoke of
his f r i e n d s h i p w i t h J e w i s h
Palestinians and the need for all
peoples to live peacefully in the
region. T h e only angry exchanges
occurred between myself and a
member of the floor who refused to
allow John Gee to speak without
interruptions after turning up three
quarters of the way through the
meeting.
I know some people regard the
P L O as a terrorist organisation, in
the same way that some (including
our Government) used to think of
the A N C as terrorists. Progress
towards peace can only be achieved
when opposing sides are allowed to
talk without preconditions. This has
clearly been shown in South Africa.
A l s o why should the fact that
someone has spent time in a foreign
prison mean that the person be
banned from I C U ? W o u l d Gaby
want Nelson Mandela or Andre
Sakharov banned too? Bassem's
imprisonment in Israel was not an
issue at this talk, indeed it only
came up during Bassem's answer to
a question from the floor. The
reasons were not given, and it is
wrong of Gaby to speculate.
I'm sorry if Gaby felt threatened
by our peaceful meeting. I'm not
sure if anybody else did, as nobody
contacted us before the meeting to
let us know. In fact nobody made
any objection to the meeting at all
Ten Hour Day
Dear Adam,
After reading Paul Davison's
letter in Felix 916 (8th Nov) about
the proposed lengthening of the
College day, it was very clear that
he had totally misunderstood the
concept behind it.
I agree with the first part of his
letter, in that it does seem as if
certain members of the college
administration, and in particular Sir
Eric A s h , are blatantly ignoring the
views of the students in continuing
with the proposals.
But when M r Davison sat down
to work out that, under the proposed
system, we would be working a 50
hour week for a 'pay' of £3,000, I
fear that over-sensationalism (or
faulty calculator) got the better of
him.
Firstly, I would be very interested
in seeing his timetable for this
year—ten hours a day? O k — s o that
was allowing for two hours for
study, but I find it hard to believe
that he wouldn't have at least three
or four of those remaining eight
hours free. The whole point being
that the actual number of hours that
students would be timetabled for
would be unchanged. B y my
reckoning—unless M r Davison is
unique amongst the second year
physicists—he does, and still would
have, about 18 hours timetabled per
week; a far cry from the figures that
he had suggested.
A n d as far as doing 'a job that
pays £3,000 a year', does he forget
and we were hardly secretive about
it, with posters and leaflets put up
all around the main areas of the
college for seven days in advance.
I also do not feel that we
compromised the apolitical nature
of the U n i o n since the Jewish
Society also held a meeting on the
peace conference the next week,
putting forward their point of view.
Members of our society attended
this meeting and we would like to
thank J-Soc for holding the meeting
in English rather than Hebrew so
we could understand and take part.
It is the exchange of views from
both sides at both the highest and
lowest level that propogates peace.
Real progress is not achieved by
censorship. I hope Gaby can realise
this and I would invite anybody to
air any grievances they may have
about our society by coming along
to our meetings held on Mondays
at 12.45pm in the green committee
room.
Many thanks,
Lee Matthews,
Treasurer ICAWIGS.
I like to think I'm representing the I
essential quintessence of delicate |
femininity, its sensitivity, its beauty I
and its quiet mystery; an evocation of |
understated eroticism.
You don't think that you are merely
prostituting your natural assets for
the cheap titilation of men over-
endowed with libido?
Well, I don't see black stockings and
lace undergarments as prostitution as
such
So, for you, there is no conflict
between following a career in
Astrophysics and tarting on screen?
ndeed No. There is a great
confluence of themes between the
t w o . One's boring as Hell, the other's 1
whoring as a belle.
I'm afraid we don't think you will be
totally committed in a degree course
n Physics here
the £5,000 paid each year by the
government for his tuition fees, or
his vastly increased employment
prospects upon graduation? If he
came to IC for a nice job with a
£3,000 salary, then I'm afraid that
he had missed the entire point of
further education, too!
For the record I am not in favour
of the proposed changes, but I do
not find the excessive dramatisation
of the effect that they would have
upon the number of hours worked
helpful to anyone, except those
supporting the changes who are
looking for evidence of a total
m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g a m o n g the
student b o d y so they c a n
'justifiably' ignore our opinions.

Last week a letter entitled
Tuppence Ha'penny was included,
signed by M Schaeffer of Maths
2. Mr Schaeffer has contacted
Felix disowning this letter.
Whoever the coward was who
handed in the letter has sunk to an
appalling depth. I rely on trust to
a great extent when accepting
letters. As of now all people
handing in letters to Felix must
show their Union Card to me
(Adam Harrington) or Rose Atkins
our typesetter operator.
Confidentiality will still be
ensured.
