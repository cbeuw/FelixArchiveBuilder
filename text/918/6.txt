House Committee
Reporting direct to Council, this
committee is responsible for
maintaining and improving the
facilities in the Union Building. The
r e f u r b i s h m e n t o f the U n i o n
Building and movement of the
Union office was completed during
the summer. T h e cost was around
£60,000, and the work was planned
and authorised in conjunction with
the U n i o n B a r and C a t e r i n g
committee.
Five Year Plans
A club or society is allocated an
annual budget which it can spend as
it wishes within the framework of
rules laid down by Imperial College
U n i o n and the M a j o r S u b
Committee ( M S C ) . The budget will
change gradually from year to year

depending on the U n i o n finances
and the popularity of the society.
However many societies have
equipment that wears out over a
period of years and then needs to
be replaced. These items of capital
equipment (eg T V s , videos, gliders,
boats...) can cost many thousands
of pounds and their cost cannot be
met from one year's budget.
A five year plan starts off in the
M S C , and is brought to the U F C
meeting. T h e plan must consist of
a statement of need, the date when
it is due, and estimates of the cost
(inc V A T ) . The plan is updated and
resubmitted and must be approved
every year. The year that the money
is due, release of the money needs
to be applied for. Even at this point,
after waiting 5 years for the money,
U F C may refuse to release the
money to the society.
Money
There is never enough of this. Each
club or society estimates in
February how much money it
would like to spend during the next
academic year. This application is
submitted to the appropiate M S C ,
where they are all collected and
collated by the H J T to be presented
to U F C .
T h e diagrams on this page show
the breakdown of the Unions budget
Imperial College U n i o n Income
1991/1992 £570,969
Equipment Grant £22,000
Interest £4,000
Investment £4,300
s membership £2,700
R o o m Bookings £18,000
Games Machines £9,000
S T A Travel £22,000
• Income to meet
salaries £25,269
(Miscellaneous £8,700
for this year of around £571,000.
These figures were drawn from
recent U F C minutes. T h e majority
o f the income comes direct from
College through the subvention and
equipment grant. T h e other income
is derived from the rent paid by
S T A Travel for their offices, the
games machines and external
b o o k i n g s of1
U n i o n r o o m s .
So how, is this money divided?
A r o u n d £200,000 goes directly to
the students in clubs and societies
through the constituent college
u n i o n s and the major
Sub—Comittees.
U n i o n finance comittee has
£55,000 to fund the five year plans
for the M C S ' s and C C U ' s which
total £40,600 this year. T h e
r e m a i n i n g m o n e y £14,400 is
allocated to contingency. This fund
is allocated to the unexpected,
which this year has had two major
claims already. T h e gliding club's
new glider increased their insurance
costs by an additional £2,300 which
had not been foreseen and all the 5
year plans for this year had been
calculated on the old V A T rate of
15%. The extra costs of these items
due to the increase in V A T will be
made from contingency funds.
T h e next major cost is the salaries
paid to the U n i o n staff, both full
time and casual. T h e full time staff
include 3 bar staff, 2 members of
staff in the print unit, 7 in the Union
office and 4 sabaticals. Casual staff
are mainly employed in the bar or
as duty officers.
Other major expenses are the
House Comittees Budget, insurance
and the Unions media costs; this is
made up from stationary, postage,
subscriptions and the telephone bill.
