(f^ Â£ l j It is almost three years since the Chernobyl disaster and what has now been forgotten amid all the cries of
On the 26th April 1986 one of the
nuclear reactors at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant near Kiev in
the Soviet Union exploded. The
blast, however, was not nuclear: the
reactor was literally blown apart by
the pressure of an enormous and
rapid build-up of steam, showering
the area with radioactive Uranium
fuel. The fire that followed spewed
clouds of smoke and radioactive
particles into the atmosphere to
spread and contaminate much of
Europe. Even today, meat from
some areas, including Cumbria and
North Wales, is too radioactive to
eat.
The Chernobyl reactors are of a
type k n o w n as the R B M K , found
only in the Soviet Union and unique
in being the only type of reactor to
combine the use of a graphite
moderated core with fuel held i n
water carrying pressure pipes (See
box). The fuel is allowed to boil the
water and the steam produced is fed
to electricity producing turbines.
This is not a naturally safe design.
A large number of safety systems
have to be built in to enable the
reactor to shut d o w n if there is a
fault. If these systems are shut off
as they were at the time of the
explosion, the reactor becomes
unstable.
The fission chain reaction itself
takes place'in the reactor core, a
cylinder of moderating graphite
some 12m across by 7m high
through which pass almost 2000
channels running from top to
bottom. The majority of these
channels hold the fuel and coolant;
the rest hold moveable rods of
absorber k n o w n as 'control rods'.
Each fuel channel contains a thin
pressure resistant pipe or 'pressure
tube', just under 9cm i n diameter,
which holds the fuel and through
which the coolant flows. Inside this
are suspended 18 long thin fuel
pins.
Each p i n consists of a central
cylinder of Uranium Dioxide fuel,
specially enriched so that it contains
more of the usable isotope
Uranium-235, clad i n a Zirconium
metal coat. The water coolant passes
through the tube, from bottom to
top, to be heated by the reacting
fuel.
'it couldn't happen here' is that the accident was very much the result of human error and human error, like
radioactive fall out, is no respecter of national boundaries. Jason Lander asks what went wrong.
A verv human error
The control channels hold rods of
the absorber Boron Carbide attached
at the top to motors which allow
them to be raised and lowered. By
altering the position of these rods it
is possible to remove neutrons and
alter the reactivity of the core.
In emergencies the reactor can be
'tripped', in which all the control
rods are simultaneously and rapidly
inserted into the core. This mops up
all available neutrons and halts the
chain reaction. In the R B M K it is
possible to partially trip the reactor:
that is, to let the rods drop but to
stop them before they reach the
bottom if, for example, the fault
clears. A n operator can manually
trip the reactor i n what is k n o w n as
a S C R A M .
The R B M K reactor is not a
naturally safe design. A boiling
water coolant is inherently unstable.
To use the jargon, the R B M K has a
highly positive 'void coefficient of
reactivity'.
Water and steam have very
different properties: water is a good
absorber of neutrons whereas steam
is not. A s the power i n the reactor
core increase, more water will boil
and less will be available to absorb
free neutrons. With more neutrons
available, the chain reaction will
accelerate and the power will
increase, boiling more water.
Without the absorbing control rods,
the reactor power and temperature,
would rapidly increase until the
reactor blew itself apart. A t very low
power, near shut down even a fully,
controlled R B M K reactor is
dangerously unstable.
Even with these inherent faults
the reactor could still have been
made safe. This the designers failed
to do. The core of the reactor is
enclosed in a leak proof concrete
and steel vault filled w i t h a
Nitrogen-Helium mixture. Even at
the high temperatures involved i n
nuclear fission, these gases will not
react with the graphite of the core:
graphite which is required by the
design to absorb large amounts of
energy. However if the vault is
breached, highly reactive Oxygen
can enter from the atmosphere and
the Graphite will catch fire.
The vault itself is not designed to
w i t h s t a n d exceptionally large

pressures: it could burst under the
pressure produced by the breakage
of a few pressure pipes.
Furthermore, there is no effective
outer containment surrounding the
vault so the radioactive particles
from the burning core will be
released straight into the
atmosphere.
The core itself is made up of
graphite blocks. The pressure pipes
are held within these blocks, nearly
touching the sides. If one of these
pipes is moved or vibrated, the
bricks could move and cause
damage that can spread throughout
the core dislocating other pipes and
even blocking vital fuel channels.
That is not to say that the reactor
could have exploded at any time, its
many layered safety system would
have been able to cope. The reactor
was designed to reduce power or
even to shut itself down in an
emergency.
If the primary cooling circuit is
damaged, the 'emergency core
cooling system' (ECCS) comes into
play. This consists of three sub-
systems activated in two stages. It
is assumed that if there is a failure,
only one half of the circuit will be
affected and the first task of the
E C C S is to provide coolant for this
section. Fast acting, electrically
driven pumps can spring into action
with 4 seconds of a fault occurring.
These will carry water from reserve
tanks straight into the damaged loop
and keep the water flowing until the
second stage can be started.
During the second stage the other
two E C C S sub-systems are started.
These are designed to keep the
reactor cool in the longer term: each
cools half the core, like the primary
cooling system, working with a
large store of water and using
p u m p s p o w e r e d by diesel
generators.
It is critical that a high voltage
source is available to power the first
stage E C C S . If an external source,
such as electricity from another
power station, is available, the
reactor can call on this. If not, it has
to find the power to cool itself from
within itself.
