THE . a . . . . cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Leicester threaten
legal action
Leicester Students U n i o n have
complained to the Commission for
Racial Equality over the 'offensive'
nature of Imperial College Union's
Rag M a g . A c c o r d i n g to the
Commission Leicester have grounds
for private prosecution under the
Race Relations Act.
Similar complaints have been
v o i c e d b y Keele U n i v e r s i t y ' s
Students U n i o n who have written
to the National Union of Students
(NUS), N U S L o n d o n a n d the
University of L o n d o n U n i o n (ULU)
asking for action to be taken.
The Staffordshire Area N U S
Convenor, John Rushton has since
written to Imperial's Rag M a g Editor
expressing h i s disgust at the
contents of the Rag M a g and at the
Editor's 'Naiive a n d immature
approach' to 'fellow human beings'. .
Keele University have also written
to the Editor pointing out that
Imperial College Rag would not be
welcome to sell mags at Keele
University again.
The letter complained that the
publication was of a 'sick' nature
and 'blatently offensive'. It claims
that the ICU Rag Mag Sellers started
at a 'Ridiculously early hour', and
did not ask K U S U permission to sell
the mag in the Union building. It
highlights as offensive, 19 sexist, 12
hetrosexist, 9 racist, 3 ableist, 3 anti
aids jokes, and 3 jokes against
victims of child abuse.
The Rag M a g Editor told FELIX
that the mag was egalitarian i n its
offensiveness. H e also pointed out
that rag had made Â£82 from its sale
at Keele and had sold a copy to the
K U S U President, who did not try to
stop them from selling further
copies. '
The Editor maintains he started
selling at 9.30am and said that he
expected some negative reaction. H e
pointed out that a similar reaction
had followed the publication of the
1984/85 mag which contained jokes
about dead babies and the Bradford
fire disaster.
'We are not in the N U S and they
have no jurisdiction over us
said.
W h e n interviewed by FELIX
yesterday, Imperial's Rag Chairman
commented 'I don't think our rag
mag is any more offensive than any
other rag mag. I think its an over
reaction - nobody is forced to buy
rag mags.'
diversity of London Union
(UT&T^/'resident, Ruth Benzimra
told FELIX that she had recieved
complaints from the NUS and from
Leicester University. She said that
she was liasing with IC Union
President Nigel Baker concerning
the mag but pointed out that it was
a matter for Imperial College Union.

RHBNC off
The Rector, Professor Eric A s h
announced on Wednesday that the
proposed merger of IC and Royal
Holloway and Bedford New College
(RHBNC) was no longer feasible.
Speaking to a meeting of the
Academic Staff Assembly, he
commented that it was 'not just
shelved', but he considered it to be
'dead'. H e concluded that it was
both the logistic problems and the
lack of staff support which had
prevented the merger's completion.
The working party which had
been set up to consider the

feasibility, initially concluded i n
favour of a merger set for 1993, first
reported in FELIX on February 3rd,
but after further study announced

merger . The Universities Funding

completion of the merger, but
according to Professor Ash, it was
unwilling to provide the finance that
was required.
The initial report stressed that the
longer term advantages of a merger
would outweigh the short-term
disadvantages, but the difficulty of
expansion o n Royal Holloway a n d
Bedford N e w College's Egham site
would seem the main reason that
the proposal to merge has been
dropped.
