Elections
An idiot's guide to STV
STV is the favoured form of PR for the SLD and the SDP and is used by the recently merged
ICU/SMHMSSU in their elections. Confused? Read on.
You will no doubt be aware by now
that on the 6th and 7th March,
voting will take place to decide who
will represent Imperial College
Union as sabbatical officers next
year.
ICU uses a system of voting much
sought after by a certain political
party; that of the Single Transferable
vote (STV). This year, the forces of
evil have conspired to land me with
five candidates for President which,
as vou will see as I explain the
counting procedure, will be an
absolute bummer. There are two
candidates each for Honorary
Secretary and FELIX Editor and
three for Deputy President.
H o w to vote
Ballot boxes will be situated around
the College and all you need to vote
is your Union card. Your name will
be checked against the College
register and your Union Card will
be punched (not by a fist). There will
be a slip of paper for each candidacy
and your first preference should be
indicated with a ' V in the first box.
This year, a new addition is the
provision of a space on the voting
slip for N e w Election. A preference
for N e w E l e c t i o n s h o u l d be
indicated if you feel that none of the
candidates is suitable and wish that
nominations should be re-opened.
Examples of first preference:
C A N D I D A T E A
C A N D I D A T E B
C A N D I D A T E C 1
C A N D I D A T E D
C A N D I D A T E E
N E W E L E C T I O N
C A N D I D A T E A
C A N D I D A T E B
N E W E L E C T I O N 1
Further preferences can be indicated
up to the number of candidates
standing plus one. Preferences must
be consecutive, ie if you wish to
express a third preference, you must
have expressed a second and first
preference. It is not necessary to
express a preference for each and
every candidate.
Examples of further preferences:
C A N D I D A T E A 2
C A N D I D A T E B 3
C A N D I D A T E C I
C A N D I D A T E D lr
C A N D I D A T E E b
N E W E L E C T I O N 5
C A N D I D A T E A 3
C A N D I D A T E B
C A N D I D A T E C i
C A N D I D A T E D
C A N D I D A T E E 2
N E W E L E C T I O N
C A N D I D A T E A
C A N D I D A T E B i
N E W E L E C T I O N 1
H o w does S T V work?
S T V revolves a r o u n d the
preferences indicated after the first
one. For example, if you felt that
only two candidates could do the
job well out of those standing then
you might express them as 1st and
2nd preference then choose N e w
Election as third preference.
When the votes are counted the
total number of valid papers (see
later) is divided by two and
increased bv one (ignoring
fractions). This number is called
'quota'. If any candidate passes
quota after counting the first
preferences, he/she is deemed
elected. If no candidate reaches
quota, the candidate with the lowest
number of votes is excluded. Their
votes are then transferred i n
accordance w i t h any second
preferences expressed to the
remaining candidate as relevant.
Papers expressing only first
preference votes for the excluded
candidate are not transferred and
the total number of votes to be
considered is decreased by the
n u m b e r of such votes, thus
lowering quota. The total votes (first
preference and transferred votes)
are then considered and if any
exceed the ' n e w ' quota, that
candidate is elected. If quota is not
then reached by any candidate, the
candidate with the lowest in the
round is excluded and their votes
transferred as above with respect to
third preferences cast.
This procedure is repeated as
necessary until a candidate reaches
the value of quota for a particular
round.
V a l i d Papers
In previous years, abstention has
been available and registered by
writing Abstain across the ballot
paper. This has been replaced by
N e w Election and any papers
marked for Abstain will be counted
as 'Invalid'. Crosses may not be
used for the purpose of indicating
preference for a candidate, only
numbers and these must be
consecutive. Nothing other than
numbers in the boxes should be
written on the paper.
