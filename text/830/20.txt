R H B N C met last week to discuss the
merger proposals and, both groups
were against the idea 'on principle'.
M r John Smith, the College
Secretary, told FELIX last week, that
the merger could not be forced
through against the wishes of the
staff at either College.
The working party found that the
proposed expansion at the Egham
campus w o u l d prove difficult,
because of the deeds of the
ownership of the land. Much of the
land at R H N B N C is Green Belt and
is maintained in the form of a trust,
the terms of which would prove
difficult to change. T h e main
building at R H B N C is listed, so
expansion in its vicinitv is serverely
curtailed.
In a joint statement the Rector,
Eric A s h , a n d the Principal of
R H B N C , Dorothy Wedderburn,
regretted the loss of opportunity for
academic benefit but claimed that
discussions had revealed 'areas of
collaboration which would be of
substantial mutual advantage'.
AUT join last NUS loans march
Over 35000 students formed a two
mile long pocession t h r o u g h
London last Saturday i n a final
protest against student loans. The
march, organised by the N U S , was
attended by students from colleges
across the country and included a
large contingent f r o m the
Association of University Teachers
(AUT). The event was controlled by
500 stewards and 1000 police, but
only five arrests were made.
The march progressed form the
Victoria E m b a n k m e n t to
Kennington Park via the Houses of
Parliament and Downing Street.
Between 60 and 100 students held
a 'sit-down' protest o n Lambeth
Bridge but were easily moved on,
and the traffic in Central London
was serverely disrupted until late
evening.
A rally held at the end of the
march saw speeches from the
General Secretary of the A U T ,
Young supporters caught by the atmosphere of the march
Diane Warwick, a n d the N U S
president Maeve Sherlock followed
by musical contributions from a
number of bands. Miss Warwick
told the crowd she was 'immensely
impressed' with the student support
for the A U T action.
Imperial College had between 60
and 100 delegates o n the march
including all the Union Executive.
Satanic motion dropped
A motion o n Salman Rushdie,
author of 'The Satanic Verses' was
d r o p p e d f r o m the agenda of
Tuesday's Union General Meeting
(UGM) following strong opposition
from the Islamic Society.
The motion instructed the society
to submit a written statement to
F E L I X c o n d e m n i n g the death
threats against M r Rushdie.
The motion was deferred when
members of the society pointed out
that under the Union constitution a
U G M agenda should be posted on
all Union noticeboards 14 days i n
advance and that the Union had
failed to do this. They added that
they needed more time to prepare
their arguments.
Ian Morris, H o n Sec (Events),
pointed out that the Union does not
know all the motions 'even up to
two minutes before the U G M ' , and
perhaps something ought to be
done to iron out this anomaly. He
also said it would be unfair and
unnecessary for the Islamic Society
to use this constitutional quibble to
take attention from the issue.
M r Morris added that the motion
had not been proposed by h i m o n
the Union and said that he would
'be pleased if no more indignant
rhetoric about the motion was
spouted in the Union's direction.'

Guilds nick Reggie
Kings College is now minus a 3 foot
long red and gold concrete lion. The
lion, which answers to the name of
'Reggie', is the Students' Union
mascot and was last seen being
escorted out of the college's Strand
site by members of the City and
Guilds Mascotry squad.
The hectic five minute raid took
place at around quarter-to-five
yesterday when fifteen crack Guilds
mascotteers , acting o n 'inside
knowledge' descended on the site
and wheeled the soon-to-be missing
lion into a waiting van.
IC bomb threats
Following last weeks bombing of
Bristol University by ' A n i m a l
Rights' activists a number of suspect
telephone calls, have been received
in the Sherfield Building at Imperial.
The College has.received two calls
in the last week which have taken
the form of enquiries from alleged
students asking what type of
research is carried out i n various
departments. Staff have been asked
not to divulge information over the
phone, but have been sending
prospectuses to enquirers.
The staff i n the Biochemistry
Department have been g i v e n
identity cards and the possibility of
increasing security further will be
discussed at a staff meeting next
Wednesday.
College Secretary, John Smith,
told FELIX that the increased
security i n the Biochemistry and
Chemistry building was mainly a
result of an explosion last term. H e
stressed that the Animal House in
Biochemistry permenantly 'poses a
large security risk' and that the
additional security is therefore a
long-term measure.
