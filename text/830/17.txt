Bit of a
scrap
IC VI—0
Barts II—0
With half the team making their last
appearance for IC, this was a match
that everybody wanted to w i n .
H o w e v e r , t h e game q u i c k l y
degenerated into a violent scrap,
largely due to the referee's inability
to spot, control or punish the
excesses of some players. The IC
defence, expertly marshalled by
D a v e H a r p e r , contained the
opposition for most of the game, but
on the several occasions that the
defence was breached, Paul Bradley
produced some breath-taking saves
to keep the goal intact. IC should
have had a penalty when Lee Davis
was quite clearly illegally brought
down in the penalty area, but the
referee remained true to form,
unable to distinguish the difference
between a football and rugby tackle,
and waved 'play-on'.
HOCKEY
Domination
IC 2nd XI—3
IC 3rd X I - 0
The 2nds continue to dominate the
U L Division Two, a point ahead of
nearest rivals, St Georges. The
scoreline was clear-cut but hard-
earned against firm resistance. The
first goal came quickly, with Paul
Turner stepping up to slot a penalty
flick high and to the right of the
keeper after only five minutes play.
Also in the first half, our short
corner routine yielded a goal. The
shot was stopped by the keeper but
Jon Beedsmore ghosted in to touch
the ball home.
During the second half, the 3rds
had one clear-cut chance when
Steve Burton broke free at the top
of the circle, but keeper Hari
Vamadevan saved well to keep a
clean sheet. Max Michaelis then
made sure of the result scoring the
third with a shot from the edge of
the o p p o s i t i o n circle passing
through a crowd of players into the
net. Full credit to the 3rd XI for
putting up a determined fight, but
after the first five minutes, the 2nds
never looked back.
SKI RACING
We like pain
Last Saturday night, the Ski Club
(soon to be renamed Masochist Soc)
competed in the last league race of
the year at Hemel Hempstead. Once
again we entered three full teams,
which perhaps reflects the success
of the Club this year. Before the
race, the first team were in a strong
position ten points clear at the top
of the table, but the second team
needed a good result to earn a place
in the National finals.
The a p p a l l i n g conditions
throughout the evening made the
slope more slippery than usual, and
this caused the first team to lose
their first race. The second team also
won one race and lost the other in
the first round, so the teams were
in the same group for round 2.
Unfortunately the third team were
drawn against two very" good teams,
so they qualified for spending the
second round in the bar.
The second round proved to be
disastrous—only the first team won
a race, and that was against the
second team! The final placings
were: Firsts 7th, seconds 8th and the
thirds 13th equal.
BADMINTON
All round
effort
Imperial College—5
Manchester—4
Imperial College continues to show
that its Badminton Club has players
to rival those of a n y other
u n i v e r s i t y . O n W e d n e s d a y
February 1, IC mens 1st team faced
Manchester in the quarter finals of
the U A U . Supporters were kept on
the edge of their seats as an
excruciatingly close game unfolded.
Our first pair, Simon and Tim, had
a very bad day, only managing to
win one game against Manchester's
3rd pair. Our 2nd pair, Bharat and
Richard, having lost to their 2nd pair
managed to pull the game round by
beating their 1st pair 17-16 in the
third. Heros of the day were Trevor
a n d S v e i n w h o , against a l l
expectations, w o n t w o games,
bringing the match to four all.
Bharat and Richard then went on to
complete what should have been a
routine w i n over Manchester's 3rd
pair. Instead though they decided
to increase m y stress level even
more by allowing themselves to be
beaten to three before winning the
game and match.

Space
Exploration
Ever wondered how advanced and
efficient the R u s s i a n Space
Programme 13 is, or how plans for
the next generation of space planes
are shaping up? Have you even
considered space as a career?
I C U Students for the Exploration
and Development of Space (SEDS)
exists to promote what i n most
people is a 'latent' interest in space
flight, and to assist a n d advise
people considering space as a
career. We aim to achieve this by
having guest speakers talk o n
various aspects of spaceflight. For
example we recently had a highly
successful talk on 'Hotol' by Dr R
C Parkinson of British Aerospace
Future Studies Department.
Our next lecture is 'future space
missions and lessons from the past'
by David Baker of Sigma Projects.
The lecture will take place o n
Wendesday March 8 i n room 144
Huxley at 2.00pm. The following
week sees D r Anders Hanson of
Commercial Space Technology
speaking on 'Biomedial Problems of
Space.

FILMSOC
Thrills &
Chills
This Thursday Filmsoc presents
Angel Heart, Alan Parker's stylish
thriller. Set in the 1950s it begins as
a conventional detective story, with
private eye Harold Angel (Mickey
Rourke) hired by the mysterious
L o u i s C y p h r e (a c h i l l i n g
performance by Robert de Niro) to
find a singer who has disappeared,
owing Cyphre money.
Angel's search leads h i m to N e w
Orleans where he is drawn into the
frightening world of voodoo and
satanism.
The film climaxes with a shock
ending that will haunt you for days
afterwards...
Angel Heart is also noticeable for
a sexually-charged performance by
Lisa Bonet, i n a role a million miles
away from that of homely daughter
Denise Huxtable, in The Cosby Show.
Details in 'What's O n ' .
Finally a plea to all you film buffs
out there looking to flesh out your
