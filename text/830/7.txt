This extra power comes from the
stations own generators. After the
steam supply is shut off and they
start to run down, the turbines will
spin fast enough to supply power to
the first stage E C C S for 45 to 50
seconds.
The generators at Chernobyl
reactor number 4 had just been
modified to try and increase this
time and it is because of mistakes
made in tests o n the modification
that the reactor exploded.
The accident at Chernobyl was the
culmination of a series of mistakes
and miscalculations which has
begun some 24 hours earlier with a
test on the E C C S . The reactor was
due to be shut-down temporarily for
maintenance, and it was decided to
take this opportunity to see how the
recently redesigned turbine-
generators could work the first stage
E C C S . The test instructions are said
to have been poor.
Over the next twelve hours, the
operators reduced the core thermal
power output, initially 32 000 M W
by half and reset the reactor to work
just one generator. Then, as
apparently instructed by the test
procedure, they turned off the
E C C S and several other safety
systems. There followed a nine hour
delay as the plant was brought in to
cope with a sudden surge i n
electricity demand. During this
time, a different operator shift,
possibly less aware of the test
conditions, clocked in.
When the reactor came off stream,
the new operators resumed the test.
They set u p an automatic control
system to halve the power again.
However, whoever set u p the
system badly miscalculated, and the
core power output dropped to a
mere 30 M W , under 1% of the
original power and well below the
level at which the power coefficient
becomes highly positive. The reactor
would have become unstable.
Such a rapid reduction of power
naturally led to a build up of
absorbing Xenon which had not had
the time to be removed or to
decay.This reduced the reactivitv
but also made the reactor much less
easy to control.
The operators started to withdraw
control rods and succeeded in
increasing the power to the safer
level of 200 M W . But because of the
extra Xenon, the rods had to be
withdrawn further than usual.
Nobody knows whv the operators
did what they did next: they turned
on all the working and reserve
coolant p u m p s a n d greatly
increased the water flow to almost
a ton a minute, fast enough to
vibrate the pipes and damage the
core. They also disabled safety
systems designed to force a shut
down in the event of a major
pressure drop.
The final two minutes
The pressure did drop and with
it the reactivity as the enormous
volume of water flowing started to
take effect. A s the pressure
dropped, the water level in the
steam drums dropped. Cooling
water was diverted to top them up
and this worked its wav to the core
further reducing the reactivity. By
now all the control rods were out of
the core.
To increase the volume of steam
and increase the reactivitv and
power, the operators slowed the
coolant flow and shut off steam
release valves. Half a minute later
steam started to build u p and
automatic control rods began to
It has been observed experimentally
that the mass of a nucleus is less-
than the s u m of the masses of its
parts. For example, and atom of
Carbon-12 (six protons, s i x
neutrons) is less massive than six
single protons a n d six single
neutrons. The difference is due to
the 'binding energy'. This is the
energy needed t o force the
constituent 'nucleons' in an atomic
nucleus apart. It is a measure of how
much unused or potential energy is
available within the nucleus: the
more 'spare' energy there is, the less
needs to be added to separate the
nucleons.
Very light and very heavy nuclei
tend to be more weakly bound: they
hold more spare energy than
nucleus into two some of this
energy can be released The former
process is nuclear fusion, the latter,
nuclear fission - the basis for all
viable n ns.

drop. Much ot the Xenon had been
washed out of the svstem and the
power started to rise.
It did not stop rising, although the
control room seemed unaware of
this, and the decision was taken to
finish the test and cut off steam to
the turbine. This caused an increase
in pressure, some of the steam
condensed a n d the reactivity
dropped. Again automated control
rods withdrew to conteract this and
then dropped almost immediately
as steam again stated to build up.
It continued to build up and the core
started to rapidly warm.
The S C R A M button was pressed
but it was too late: too manv control
rods were too far from the core and
some of those that were not jammed
in distorted channels. The pressure
build up was so great that it shut
one-way valves in the cooling
system. N o more cooling water
could reach the core. What was
already there eveporated and the
core reached 100 times its safe
maximum power. The pressure
build up blew pressure tubes and
the inadequate vault apart and left
the World with its worst ever
nuclear disaster.

Splitting the atom
and the available, fissionable fuel
atoms, for example Uranium-235,
allowed to release energy naturally
by decaying into smaller particles:
the process would be too slow to be
usable. Atomic fission has to be
artificially speeded up.
Fission reactors take advantage of
the fact that while Uranium-235 is
comparatively stable, the heavier
and m u c h rarer isotope
Uranium-236 is not, a n d will decay
rapidly releasing its energy in the
form of fast neutrons. T o produce
useful power, the lighter isotope
must be converted into a heavier
m e by bombardment with slow
moving neutrons.
A chain reaction can be set u p .
Uranium-236 can be produced b y
bombarding atoms of Uranium-235
with the neutrons produced in
Uranium-236 decays. What is
needed is some means of slowing
the neutrons from the decay
sufficiently for them to be absorbed.
This is achieved with a material
known as a moderator which is-
dense enough to interact w i t h the
neutrons but stable enough not to
absorb a significant n u m b e r .
Graphite, used i n the R B M K , is by
far the most common example.
It must be possible to control the
reaction. Here, some form of
absorber is used. This is a material,
such as Boron, that c a n readily
accept excess neutrons. By changing
the amount of absorber, it is possible
to vary the number of neutrons ' i n
circulation' and increase of decrease
the reactors ability to sustain a
reaction, or 'reactivity'. A higher
reactivity means a greater power
output. Xenon,- one of the by-
products of Uranium fission also has
absorbing properties and, if allowed
to build u p can slow or even halt a
reaction.
The heat generated by the fission
has to b e , r e m o v e d . • N o t
surprisingly, this is done by a
coolant In the R B M K , the coolant
is light water ( ' H , 0 ) which also has
the properties of a moderator and an
absorber.
