Alternative accommodation: squatting
The alternative guide to finding
somewhere to live in London.
Squatting
Short-life housing originally grew
out of the squatting movement of
the 1970's. Groups of squatters
formed housing cooperatives and
succeeded in getting licences from
the local authorities. According to
latest estimates there are still about
35,000 people living i n squats i n
London alone (April 1987). There
are now eight local squat groups left
in London coordinated by the
Advisory Service for Squatters (the
ASS), which also publishes the
'Squatters Handbook', an excellent
source of information and advice on
all aspects of squatting.
Squatting is unlawful not illegal.
This means that it is a civil dispute
dealt with by civil courts. The police
are only involved in criminal matters
w h e r e s o m e t h i n g illegal has
h a p p e n e d . It is essential to
understand the laws involved. If
vou follow some commonsense
guidelines when setting up a squat
you will avoid many problems later.
The main laws covering squatting
are contained in the criminal law act,
1977 (sections 6 to 10). Squatting an
empty premise which nobody else
is using, nor intending to use, with
a few exceptions, is still legal.
Indeed, the same laws protect you
from being thrown out by force.
Anvone doing so without first
getting a proper eviction order, may
these rights have to be worked for
and are never really secure. The
insecurity is the main drawback to
squatting.
The first rule about squatting is
careful planning and organisation.
By doing the initial research
thoroughly one can avoid many of
the possible pitfalls and you may be
able to find good accommodation
with the potential to last a long time.
When looking for a place to squat,
be realistic. A s a general rule
boarded-up a c c o m m o d a t i o n
awaiting development, previously
empty for at least a month and
owned by the council or by a
housing association is ideal. A trip
to the local planning consents office
is extremely useful. Often this can
tell you how long you will be able
to live i n a property. Planning
consent takes ages and, as often as
not, is refused. Hopefully nobody
will bother evicting you until they
are ready to go ahead w i t h
development.
Too many squatters go for smart
accommodation only left empty for
a short period. Not surprisingly they
are evicted quite quickly and are
back o n the streets. This short-
sighted o p p o r t u n i s m gives
squatting a bad name.
It is essential to ensure that the
property is not occupied nor is there
anyone intending to occupy the
property in the near future.
Both situations are covered by the
themselves be committing a criminal
offence under section six. In this
respect and for other basic rights,
squatters have the same
entitlements as any other house-
holder. They have the right to
privacy, rubbish collection, postal
d e l i v e r y , social security a n d
essential services like water and
electricity. In practice almost all of
Criminal Law Act, sections 7 and 12.
A 'displaced residential occupier'
(DRO) or a 'protected intended
occupier (PIO), as defined by these
sections, has the power to evict
squatters without applying for a
court order. Consequently, it is
essential to make sure that the
property is really unused or you will
probably be evicted very quickly.
When you are sure that the place
is vacant, the next thing to check is
the c o n d i t i o n inside. M a n y
landlords, a n d even councils,
simply vandalise empty properties
by disconnecting the electrical mains
and tearing out piping. They may
do this simply to enhance their
chances of gaining p l a n n i n g
permission. Local authorities are
often reluctant to grant permission
that destroys living accommodation,
so by vandalising the property
, landlords can claim that it is
uninhabitable anyway. For every
property that landlords actually
handover for temporary short-life
housing, while awaiting planning
permission consent, there are
dozens vandalised in this way and
left vacant. Such properties are a
shear waste. The cost of repairing
them to make squatting possible is
not worth the risks involved.
ORGANISE
Usually for a successful squat a large
group of at least six people is
needed. Move in quickly, change
and fit all the locks, and then start
furnishing and decorating. For the
first few weeks at least there must
be someone in the squat at all times.
This prevents anyone using section
6 in the Criminal Law Act; simply
breaking in and throwing your stuff
out. In effect, if you leave the place
empty someone could squat you! If
someone is going to evict y o u
legally, they will have to go to the
civil courts which can take up to two
months and even then it might be
another month before the over-
worked court bailiffs can get round
to evicting you. Hopefully though,
you have found somewhere where
nobody will bother y o u . Often
f qi.Mters c a n come to a n
a r r , e m e n t with the owners which
cur. benefit both sides and avoid the
courts.
Many people object to squatting
as immoral a n d say that it is
basically a crime, that squatters are
jumping the house waiting lists and
that they are trying to get something
for nothing. Accussations that all
squatters are of dubious a n d
undesirable character are common.
Squatters are normal people who
often, due to desperation, have
chosen to act rather than be pushed
around. The present system of
rented accommodation sees many
poor people having to pay most of
their earnings to rich landlords who
just sit back and let it roll in.
It is a greater crime that there are
more than 850,000 empty homes in
the U K which could be used to
house the homeless. A vast majority
Libyan Embassy squatted
of these are in London and by
squatting they are regained a n d
made inhabitable again.
Imperial College students have
been involved in squatting before.
In particular, the mass squat of the
Libyan consulate from mid-April
1986 until late June. During this
time, around 40 people occupied the
abandoned consulate until finally
being evicted. It is quite possible
that if they had caused less nuisance
to local residents they could have
been there much longer.
In conclusion, both short-life
housing and squatting offer viable
and cheap alternative sources of
accommodation. Both require work
and effort to furnish, decorate and
be successful. Whilst short-life
housing is a cheap alternative to
normal rented accommodation it is
difficult to get a place without
persistence.
Squatting requires g o o d
organisation. There are many
pitfalls involved and the insecurity
is a major drawback. Many people
will remain convinced that it is
morally wrong. However, if the
drastic financial changes threatened
by the present Government o n
students come to force then
squatting will become very attractive
financially. Maybe large student
squats with a high public profile,
like the Libyan consulate squat,
would be one of the most effective
forms of student protest. That is for
the future, but for the present, good
luck i n your search f o r
accommodation, there is still hope-
but it takes work! Think about the
alternatives.
