Club Lager
Many myths have grown up about
Club Lager holidays in recent years.
FELIX sent a team of five reporters
- Kev, Gazzer, Darren, Wayne and
someone w h o could read and write
- to the Costa Del Thug. O u r
intrepid quintet spill the beans on
the steamy image of Club Lager.
Here is the diary of the person who
was foolish enough to remain sober
throughout the adventure.
July 1st
A journey of a thousand miles
must start with the first step and our
first step was to board the coach at
Basildon. Opposite the coach station
was the Boar's Head a n d this
proved to be too m u c h of a
temptation for 'the lads'. After all,
they had to practice their singing. In
the pub it was 'We're all going to
sunny Spain' and o n the coach
'Viva Espana'.
Gazzer decided to pass time by
flashing his bottom at the drivers on
the motorway. O u r spirits were
dampened a little w h e n we found
the airport to be packed and our
flight to be delayed by five hours.
'Right lads,' shouted Wayne, 'let's
find some L A G E R . ' Everyone
agreed that this was a good idea,
and soon we were i n a Heathrow
bar surrounded b y plastic foliage
and cigarette ends. There were two
girls at the bar.
'Flop your tits out d a r l i n ' , '
suggested Kev.
'Whoooooaaaaaaahhhhh,' agreed
Wayne.
By a remarkable coincidence the
two birds, Sharona and Tracetta,
were also going to the Costa del
Thug as genuine Flamenco dancers
(from Barnsley). Ten pints later
Darren grew a little bored - it was
time for trolley wars,
'Here Sharona sit on this.'
It w a s really surprising how
quickly a packed crowd can move
w h e n confronted with ten stone of
speeding Barnsley skirt. The Police
were kind enough to give us a n
escort to Gate 23, and soon we were
airborne. Poor old Darren spent
most of his time handcuffed to the
coffee machine after making a n
improper suggestion to the air
hostess.
Having passed through customs
with only a short confrontation, we
climbed into a cab and asked for the
Hotel del Clapp, described in the
brochure as having a romantic view.
The drive was surprisingly short as
the Hotel was twenty feet from the
end of the runway. We were greeted
by Senor Castrato the manager,
k n o w n by his friends as Fidel.
'We are most aroused to welcome
you to our humble Hotel. Manuel
will be pleeesing to take your bags
to your room.'
There was no mistake about it, we
were all going to share one room.
We all started to create strategies for
getting laid.
July 2nd
Sharona and Tracetta were very
good sports, swapping beds at each
c M r u s of 'Viva Espana!' There was
o...y one shower between 250
guests, so w e decided to purge
ourselves of our dirty prod games
in the swimming pool. We were
feeling a little thirsty, so we asked
Manuel to bring our drinks to the
side of the pool and invited h i m to
join us. Manuel was a very shy man,
and it tool a lot of persuading to get
him into the water. Wayne and
Gazzer put their point across very
forcefully; they threw h i m i n . For
the entertainment of the guests
Manuel then pretended to drown by
flailing his arms about wildly,
gurgling, submerging for very long
periods of time and finally going
blue. What a good sport! Tracetta
was so impressed that she insisted
on thanking h i m i n her o w n special
way. That soon brought h i m
around.
After lunch, Fidel offered to take
us on a guided tour to see the best
of Tossermolinos. Our first stop was
at the Tossermolinos bullfight. The
lads thought that the bull didn't
stand much of a chance, so they
decided toshift the odds i n his
favour b y t h r o w i n g cans of
Tennents at the matador. This was
an unpopular decision as far as the
locals were concerned - the Spanish
adore their matador.
Never let it be said that British
hooligans are stupid. We never pick
a fight when we're outnumbered, so
we made a quick exit to the coach
which rushed us away to the local
vineyard. Here we were introduced
to the fine art of wine- tasting. The
guide demonstrated the proper way
to taste. First he looked at the colour
of the wine, then by swilling the
wine around his glass he savoured
the fine bouquet, took a sip and
swilled it around his mouth and
finally spat out. Then he invited us
to do the same. Kev found that the
wine disagreed with his delicate
palette.
'This lager's flat," he cried as he
skillfully spat a glass into the guide's
face.
We grabbed a few bottles of the
flat lager and made our way back to
the coach.
Sharona noticed that the coach-
driver w a s M a n u e l , the mild-
mannered waiter. He was such a
good sport, even when we poured
w i n e d o w n h i s trousers a n d
moonied at the locals, as is our
custom. By the time we arrived back
at the hotel the sun was setting. This
was our chance to experience the
extravagant Tossermolinos night-
life. Fidel had some tickets to a local
night-club called the B u c k i n g
Bronco. The bouncer was our old
friend Manuel. H e was S U C H a
good sport, even when we made
him hop d o w n the street with his
trousers around his ankles singing
'Tossermolinos, Tossermolinos'.
The Bronco had made the mistake
of selling Tennents draught at the
bar. A s the evening progressed we
grew very hot and had to strip down
to our Union Jack boxer-shorts and
Wicked Willie T- shirts. Sharona
was Miss Basildon Bust 1988 so she
was bound to w i n the wet T-shirt
competition.
The club was named after its
rodeo machine. Late in the evening
the ladies, dressed only in bikinis
were invited to mount the beast and
ride. Timid Tracetta would only ride
side-saddle but Sharona straddled
very capably. She had a pelvis like
a four-stroke diesel engine a n d
could take the bucking longer than
any other girl. Kev was still sober
enough to find the speed control
and use it to bring Sharona d o w n
to earth. The rest of the evening is
a little blurred i n my mind as I
succumbed to the Tennents. The
next t h i n g I remember is a
bewildered Spanish policeman who
didn't want to do the conga and his
angry policemen friends who took
us to the police station.
July 3rd
The prison had nicer rooms than
the Hotel del Clapp, but the gaoler
had no sense of humour. H e got
terribly angry when Darren tried to
debag him. H e ran out of our cell
shouting 'Bastardas, bastardas'.
Then he sulked and wouldn't even
answer to the name of Manuel. We
were very impressed when we were
taken out of the cell and driven
straight to the airport where w e
bought lots of duty-free whiskey.
The p o l i c e m e n seemed very
cheerful when they saw us board
the aircraft.
The Costa del Thug is a lousy
place. Take my advice, and stay in
England for your holidays. The lager
may be more expensive but the
police are more friendly.
