OPERA
A King Listens
A King Listens or The Emperor's
N e w Qothes? That was the question
I heard voiced in the ladies' during
the interval of the British premiere
of this new opera—a reworking of
Shakespeare's Tempest. It w a s
certainly hard to tell whether the
tangibly enthusiastic atmosphere in
the Royal Opera House was out of
a g e n u i n e enjoyment of the
performance or a desire to appear as
musically sophisticated as the next
person. A t the end of the initially
polite applause swelled as the
audience recognised the individual
contributions of the soloists,
designer, production team a n d
finally the composer—Luciano
Berio, who had also conducted. This
was quite right and proper as the
performances were well crafted and
Graham Vick's, apparently 'wholly
faithful', production creates what
the stage directions describe as a
'Kaleidoscope of action'. Berio's
music is modern, rich and intriguing
but is the opera a success.?
When we hear do we listen?
W h e n we listen what do we hear?
There are arguably n o more
important questions for a musician
to ask in an age when the act of
conscious listening a n d
understanding is ever more forcibly
submerged by the tumult of passive
hearing. Berio has made them the
centre of this, h i s theatrical
extravaganza and in place of what
could have been merely a didactic
'Walker'
Cert 18, opens late March at the
Gate, Notting Hill.
Here's a new film from the makers
of Sid and Nancy and Repo Man/
The story is true. Walker strides into
Nicaragua from the U S and becomes
democratic dictator for two years.
Alex Cox has chosen to tell this tale
in and o d d mixture of parody,
comedy and cynicism.
There is a lot of blood in this film.
It is strangely beautiful; a surreal
spurting blood a n d slow-flying
bodies create a kind of ballet set to
Mexican bass-lines. The music is
well chosen: too hard for sentiment,
too subtle to glorify the horror in
any way. There are many of these
'blood ballets' and they are all
entrancing.
Sadly this talent is floundering in
the rest of the film. Cox succeeds so
well i n avoiding any established
styles and attitudes that he loses
sight of his o w n . There is no
dishonest, cheap emotion, no
glorification of battle, nor even easy
condemnation of America. It is not
cliched. But it is not interesting
either.
Even the character of Walker
remains unexplored, rendered
impotent, for the most part, by
comedy. There is only one scene of
scary craziness, when Walker cuts
off his lifeline shipping supply from
the U S almost to spite himself.
Hovering on the thin edge of sanity
and genius, from whence the
power-craze springs, this is a
breath-holding, tantalising glimpse
of what could have been.
Cox sticks to his guns throughout,
and edits out any more emotion.
What a shame, all we have left is the
visual stimulation and a few laughs
with a cynical after-taste. G o home
and make a music video boys.

and philosophising drama based on
Calvino's libretto he has created an
enthralling, dream-like musical
spectacle which circles around the
questions without ever anwering
them. So writes Nicholas Kenyon of
the Sunday Observer.
A g r e e d , the evening w a s
entertaining, the story is irrelevant,
and no answers are provided. There
is a constant background 'noise' of
singers, scene shifters, ballroom
dancers, acrobatics, a trapeze artist,
a woman sawn i n half etc. (I was
mesmerised by a prolonged lovers'
tiff between two mimes) and w h e n
the chorus took off (literally) it was
something of a theatrical coup. But
in the final analysis I am reminded
of Rossini's comment on Wagner.
There were some beautiful moments
but bad quarters of an hour!'.

Wall Street
Oliver Stone's expedition into the
fast world of high finance and high
society was one of last year's best
film releases. The leading role is
taken by Michael Douglas, playing
the corporate raider Gordon Gekko,
rich beyond belief and ruthless
beyond imagination.
Broker Charlie Sheen aspires to be
his understudy, and gets a shot
t h r o u g h sheer persistence.
Catapulted into this crazy world,
unready and incapable, he is always
destined for a mighty fall and his
only compensation is that he just
might be able to bring Gekko d o w n
with himself.
The supporting cast of Daryl
H a n n a h , M a r t i n S h e e n a n d
Terrence Stamp help the movie
along, and the insular setting of the
New York business world gives a
solid and beleiveable element to an
excellent movie. This film is
r e c o m m e n d e d to everyone,
especially if you missed it last time
around.

PREVIEW
Working
Girl
Wall Street meets Secret of my Success
in this comedy drama set i n the
executive shark pools of Manhattan.
Tess M c G i l l (Melanie Griffith) is
smart, gorgeous and struggling. Her
life has become an endless round of
ferry commutes, lecherous bosses
and low pay. But she is determined
to use her brain and talent to pull
herself out of the secretarial pool
and into the-upper echelons of N e w
York's brokerage industry. With the
help of a white collar Prince
Charming (Harrison Ford), she
takes a trip u p the treacherous
corporate ladder, but all the while
trying to avoid her high-powered
boss (Sigourney Weaver), a
seductive piranha.
A powerhouse trio of stars add
zest to an already impressive script.
Malanie Griffith (Body Double,
Stormy Monday) at last gets a chance
to shine after years of mediocre
roles; Harrison Ford tries his hand
at comedy, and is rather good at it.
We'll see him in Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade in June; and Sigourney
Weaver is delightfully evil in a Oscar
nominated role.
The film has picked u p a wealth
of Oscar nominations including best
picture. It promises to be this year's
Broadcast Neivs.
Release date March 31st.
