Heart attack city
Look after vour heart week, 6-10
March
Coronary Heart Disease is a most
common cause of death in Britain
today. It kills more people than all
the different types of cancer put
together. Every year in England
about 150,000 people die of a heart
attack or related condition. The
death from Coronary Heart Disease
(CHD) in England and Wales is one
of the highest in the world.
There are several different causes
of C H D and scientific studies over
the last thirty years have shown that
certain factors can increase the
likelihood of developing the disease.
Some of these; such as gender, age,
and family history are
unavoidable—others are not.
Cigarette smoking is n o w the
most important preventable cause of
premature death and chronic illness.
About one out of every four
smokers dies from diseases directly
caused by smoking. Lung cancer,
and other l u n g diseases like
emphasema can be caused by
smoking and the risk of getting
heart disease is double for a smoker.
A survev of 'the Heights and
Weights of Adults in Great Britain'
carried out by O P C S in 1984 showed
that more than 30% of adults i n
England are overweight. Most
obesity is not just due to overeating
but eating too much of the wrong
kind of food. A diet high in fat, and
particularly saturated fats raises the
concentration of cholesterol in the
blood which over a time causes
n a r r o w i n g of the arteries
consequently leading to heart
disease. A low fat, high fibre diet
can keep weight under control and
lessen the risk of C H D .
Lack of exercise, high alcohol
intake, high blood pressure and
stress are also contributing factors
in the incidence of heart disease.
Regular exercise increases the
efficiency of both the heart and
circulation, releases tension a n d
helps control weight. Hypertension
(high blood pressure) sufferers can
alleviate their condition and reduce
the risk of C H D by cutting down
their alcohol and fat intake, giving
up smoking and increasing exercise.
Having looked at the causes of
C H D many of us will realise that we
are already at risk of developing the
disease in later life. So what can we
do about it? The answer is to try to
change to a healthier lifestyle which
might mean giving u p smoking,
changing our diet or getting some
exercise. A s part of the Welfare '89
initiative IC Union have arranged
w i t h the Riverside H e a l t h
Promotion Service to run an event
to promote 'Look after your heart
week'. This will take place in the
JCR o n Thursday 9th M a r c h
between l l a m - 2 p m . There will be
displays providing information
about diet, exercise, giving u p
smoking etc and representatives
from Riverside Health Promotion
Service will be there to answer your
questions. So call in to the JCR on
March 9, your future health may
depend on it!

'Blistering guitar, keyboards,
drums from a maniac and
samples'
Tonight, Friday 3rd March, IC Ents
are putting o n Jesus Jones plus
support from Century Boys in the
Union Lounge. Not only this, but
there's a disco and bar extension.
The doors open at 9pm and tickets
are available on the door (at £2) or
in advance from the Union Office
(£1.50).
For those of you who've not heard
of the band, they're just outside the
charts with their debut single Info-
Freako (if you've come along to any
of the Union discos in the past
couple of weeks you'll have heard
it played regularly).
Widely recognised as potentially
the first pop stars of '89, the band,
since forming in August last year
and signing a deal with food
records, have attracted a great deal
of attention a n d those of y o u
who've glanced through the music
press recently will have seen the
hype associated with this.
The live show has been described
as 'blistering guitar, keyboards,
drums from a maniac and samples'.
The band look set to chart in the
next couple of weeks and this will
be one of the last opportunities to
catch them before they become
incredibly successful.

Rumours
Elections
I have heard a few rumours that
certain candidates are expressing
disquiet because 1 am a bit friendly
(not biblically) with some of their
adversaries. M y answer to this is
simple. I was elected as Hon Sec last
year as a fit and proper person with
sufficient integrity to act out all my
duties, including Returning Officer.
If people think that my integrity will
not encompass the ability to remain
impartial during the elections or any
appeal against procedure, then they
should no-confidence me at a U G M .
If, however, thev feel that this is not
the case but that I should shun the
friends 1 have had for years purely
because they are standing, I would
suggest that they consider how they
would feel if people expected them
to compromise their friendships
because of pressure applied due to
the nature of their work.
