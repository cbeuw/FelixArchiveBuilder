Reviews
Rainman
Every Easter we have the Oscars, a
time w h e n movies are sold o n
nominations rather than cast. Every
year there are a couple of films
hoping to grab more than a handful,
prominent for a while, forgotten a
few months later. Remember The
Last Emperor, Ghandi and Amadeus?
This year is no different.
Rainman boasts eight
nominations, including best actor,
director and film. It opens today, in
a swarm of publicity, and while it
may well clean up at the Academy,
it will be far from your mind by the
time you're lazing on a beach, just
as its illustrious predecessors were
in summers past.
This is the story of Charlie Babbitt
(Tom Cruise), a smooth, slick Italian
car salesman, struggling between
big bucks a n d b i g debts. H i s
character has all the substance of
Cruise's previous roles in Top Gun,
Cocktail and The Colour of Money,
especially h i s arrogance a n d
insecurity. Here though is a guy that
women would kill to have, and men
would have to kill.
Charlie learns of his father's
death, but does not inherit the three
million dollar estate. There are
events past which have severed
their relationship. H e remembers
little except that he was unhappy.
'When I was a kid and got scared,
the Rain M a n used to sing to me.'
R a y m o n d Babbitt ( D u s t i n
Hoffman) is Charlie's elder brother,
formerly undiscovered, and now
sole beneficiary of the will. He is an
autistic savant, a man of great talent,
locked within his o w n mind, his
incomprehension of feeling and
emotion, a barrier to the outside
world.
Charlie needs Raymond to get his
half of the estate. He also needs to
be in L A to rescue his business, but
R a y m o n d w i l l only travel o n
backroads. It is destined to be a long
and tiresome journey for Charlie, as
he attempts to cope with the present
w h i l s t r e n d e z v o u s i n g w i t h a
forgotten past.
It is hard to explain the appeal of
Rainman. Hoffman is superb and
there can be few complaints when
he walks away with his Oscar next
m o n t h . T o m C r u i s e too is
uncharacteristically proficient,
giving depth a n d feeling to a
difficult role, and all the time
emphasising the frustration of
Charlie Babbitt: 'I think this autism
is a bunch of shit because you can't
tell me y o u ' r e n o t i n there
somewhere.'
The music and photography give
the film a warm feel, and there is
almost a touch of Miami Vice about
it. A good deal of close camerawork
, keeps the story intense despite an
absence of action and there are one
or two laughs to relieve this tension.
Academy A w a r d for best film?
Perhaps. It deserves something, a
few hours of your time if nothing
else. But it would be nice to see the
Academy mark Cruise's first proper
film role, and Hoffman's best, i n
some way.
Rainman is showing at The Plaza,
Lower Regent Street.

EXHIBITION
Leonardo
Artist, Scientist, Inventor,
(Hayward Gallery)
Anybody w h o calls themselves a
scientist or an engineer owes it to
themselves to visit this unique
exhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's
work. The range of exhibits on show
demonstrate the incredible breadth
of da Vinci's interests, opening with
an outline of his career through
drawings which relate to his artistic
projects, running through 'The
Ages of M a n ' , "The Natural World',
'Body of Earth and Body of M a n ' ,
'The V o r t e x ' , ' T h e Forces of
Destruction', 'Art and Imagination',
'The Measuring Eye' and 'Structure
and M e c h a n i s m ' . T h e
draughtsmanship and beauty of his
drawings is quite breathtaking, and
their surprisingly small size serves
to e m p h a s i z e the incredible
intricacy—the anatomical drawings
are particularly remarkable.
The exhibition moves onto da
Vinci's scientific and engineering
work, but the comment theme is the
magnificent coherence of his vision
of m a n i n nature, a n d h i s
observation of the forms which
occur i n nature, and the way i n
which these forms could be utilised.
The sketches of the inventions are
realised in well-made models, most
notably t h e l o v i n g l y made
centralised symmetrical church, and
the flying machine, which was
created especially for this exhibition.
The exhibition also includes
computer graphics o n the
transformation of geometrical
bodies, the effects of shadow and
light, symmetrical churches, the
branching system of trees and
lungs, and the perspective of the
'Last Supper', all supplied by I B M ,
the sponsor. These give a
fascinating insight into da Vinci's
thoughts.
This incredible assemblage of
w o r k w i l l probably never be
gathered together again, and so
your £2 (with a student card) will be
money well spent. By the way, wrap
up well; the exhibition is very
popular, and a long queue is almost
inevitable.

The Big Blue
' A n existential comic strip' is how
Time Out described Luc Besson's The
Big Blue. The film is about t w o
men's passion for the sea. Jacques
(Jean-Marc Barr) is a quiet,
monosyllabic Frenchman and his
childhood friend Enzo (Jean Reno)/;
a boistrous Italian. They are
competing against each other in the
W o r l d Diving Championships.
Pouting blond Johana (Rosanna
Arquette) provides the romantic
interest.
The scene is set in Sicily, Greece
and the French Riviera and boasts
some of the most mesmerising
photography to be seen on the silver
screen in recent years.
A strong cast of happy dolphins
charms the audience with their
gymnastics. T h e t w o m e n
themselves perform superhuman
feats of staying under water for
incredible lengths of time.
Throbbing music, 70mm scope
and slow motion sequences give the
impression of another world.
This film is powerful, melancholic
and different—a healthy antithesis
of Jaws.
Long after I had left the theatre,
images of The Big Blue still
reverbrated through my head.
A minor classic.
