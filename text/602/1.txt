The security of the Southside Halls of Residence has still not
been adequately improved following the rape which occurred
there over one and a half years ago and numerous thefts. A
new system of electronic locks has not yet been installed,
despite indications from the Estates section that they would
do so over the Christmas vacation.
Following a rape in the basement of Southside in M a y 1980 it was
decided that access to the halls was too easy and that a new system of
locks should be installed. T h e main problem was lire doors would have
to be locked, so an electronic system was necessary with locks linked to
the fire alarm system which would automatically open if a fire broke out.
A system was suggested and a quotation obtained. This proved "too
expensive" and was shelved when major structural changes were pro-
posed to combat the same problem.
A less expensive system was investigated last year which, at a cost of
approximately/'3,500, would adequately dothejob. T h e Chief Security
Officer, M r Reeves, persuaded Estates that this system would be needed
if the structural changes went ahead or not.
U n i o n P r e s s u r e
Last term the Union President. M r Nick M o r t o n , and Welfare
Officer. M r Nick Pyne, pressed Estates for an installation date on
Student Residence Committee. T h e indication was clearly given that
this would be done over the Christmas vacation, but it was not.
M r D o n Clarke, Estates Secretary, told F E L I X that he did not know
why the system had not been installed. " M o s t of my people are out
today," he said, "the rail strike, you know."
The reason for the delay is still not clear at the time of going to press.
Q E C Merger
Off!
The proposed merger between Imperial College and Queen
Elizabeth College has been shelved for the time being.
At the end of last term the draft proposal horn L o r d Flowers and D r
Barnes (Principal of Q E C ) was amended by IC's Board ol Studies. This
amended draft proposal was submitted to the G o v e r n i n g Body and
passed. Alter such changes it was not surprising that the new proposals
proved unacceptable to the Academic Board and College C o u n c i l of
Q E C .
The Rector, L o r d Flowers, told F E L I X that as far as h e was
concerned "the door is still open " and that negotiations could still
continue. It seems, however, that it is up to Q E C to re-approach IC.
