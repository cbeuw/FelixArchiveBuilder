Cutter's Way, Gate Notting Hill, X
A description eludes me at present but the plot
in its most basic (and perhaps incorrect) form
is fairly simple: A rich and powerful magnate,
J . C o r d murders a young cheerleader and it
seems that he will get away with the crime
because the only witness, Richard Bone, is
almost fatally apathetic. Bone has a friend,
Alex Cutter, a Vietnamese war veteran who is
heavily mutilated and seems to have one bodily
organ where most people have two, and it is
this young man who makes for the vitality of
the film. By hook or by crook (the latter as it
turns out) Cutter intends to get C o r d for his
deed just like The Mounties always do. It is
very difficult to decide as to whether it is or is
not worth seeing since most of the few people
who have seen it like it, but I didn't.
It was not as entertaining as Raiders nor
as morally depressing as Christiane F. It is not
"light", although it does have some amusing
scenes, but then so do a lot of B movies.

Translations. A new play by Brian Friel.
Directed by Donald McWhinnie. The
Lyttelton, National Theatre.
A Ledge school in the year 1833 in the
townland of Braile Beag (Ballybeg), an Irish-
speaking community in County Donegal, sets
the scene for the play Translations by the
contemporary Irish playwright Brian Friel. A
hedge school, I was interested to find out, was
a place such as a barn or a loft where peasants
studied in the evening after a hard day's toil on
the land. They were taught by men drawn from
their own stock and they often attained a high
degree of proficiency in such unlikely subjects
as the classics. Learning was done entirely
through the vernacular Gaelic.
-Against this somewhat inconspicuous scene
a m i l i t a r y d e p u t a t i o n f r o m the B r i t i s h
g o v e r n m e n t is s t a l k i n g the c o u n t r y s i d e
anglicising all the place names for the first
Ordinance Survey of Ireland, and all this at a
time when the hedge schools and the Gaelic
language they were keeping alive were being
absorbed into the recently introduced State
system of education with English as the first
language.
O n a superficial level the play is depicting a
national and rustic way of life being wasted
away by a temporal and political tide, and the
tense relationship between the English and the
Irish depicted in the play set almost 150 years
ago is still sadly relevant today. But the
underlying substance of the play is more
universal and meaningful. Friel is building onto
the fabric of hedge schools and the Ordinance
Survey a masterful and beautiful exposition of
languageâ€”both on the aesthetic and uplifting
heights it can reach, but also on the frustration
and even danger it can engender. T h e s e
qualities of language are expressed beautifully
in the play. A n old, grey bearded peasant
becomes enraptured by Virgil. A dumb girl is
taught to say her name. The school master
delights in the Latin roots of Gaelic words. A n
English officer anglicises place names, but
obliterates whole local legends in the process.
A n d a peasant girl and an officer in love with
each other can no more than embrace. All
these qualities and others are expressed in the
play in a dialogue of words which in themselves
I found incredibly moving, heart-warming and
incredibly beautiful. E v e n the acting was
superlative.
The play was first staged on a tour of Ireland
last year but later appeared at the highly
enterprising Hampstead Theatre where it was
greeted in The Times as a national classic. The
director of the theatre upon reading the play
said "It was the sort of script you read once
every ten years if you are lucky". The play is
certainly in a class of its own.

Still Crazy The Bush (Shepherds Bush
Green). Presented by Bush Theatre Hull
truck. Runs until January 30.
A play that trails t h r o u g h the s w i r l i n g
misappreheosions, assumptions and personal
fall of those young in the sixties and their
inability to come to terms with the notion that
they corrupted and betrayed the ideals of their
nebulous twenties. Nick, who works for the
B B C , and L i b b y , who brings up a child,
attempt to unravel the eighties in cliches two
decades too late.
The play invokes the characters' guilt at the
ideals of y o u t h , modified by middle class
aspirations, eventually degenerating into semi-
d e t a c h e d homogenity. W h o l e f o o d yogurt
provides the final, media-cultivated, corrupt
touchstone for those immersed in being forty
whose slogans have dissipated in a spasm of
consumerism.
Nick sees himself in Maddie, a frayed 'new
romantic', and Tyle, who flirts with punk, and
s e i z e s the o p p o r t u n i t y of c o n f l i c t as a
justifiable method of making the problems of
his past physical. By applying them to another
he ignores them in himself. The essential
tragedy of N i c k is the r e a l i s a t i o n a n d
personalisation of guilt.
Nick and Tyle are both created and crippled
by b a s i c a l l y the s a m e c o n c e r n s . T h e y
understand each other and the nature of their
conflict totally. In the last resort they are inter-
changeable. They are both safe in the rut of
the relationship between them.
Nick is the horror of Tyle as in him Tyle can
see what he will become. Each character
lingers over their own terror in the relentlessly
Habitat-inspired set.
The two aging, sold-out hippies, Nick and
L i b b y , are a b l e to d e v e l o p w i t h i n the
restrictions of role while Tyle, the obligatory
punky/Bowie clone, and Maddie, the greying
new r o m a n t i c , solidity in rather crudely
imposed limitations.
Nick muses on the brave new world of the
sixties that has passed by and it becomes
apparent that he is no different to any old man
brooding on his youth. The final confrontation
with Tyle is both painful and funny as both are
a mockery of what they express.
