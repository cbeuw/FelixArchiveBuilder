MOTION ON GRANTS.
ICU Notes:
Proposed by:
Seconded by:
Martin Taylor
Nick Morton.
1. That the government plans to increase student grants by
only 4% next year, to Â£1900 f o r students i n London
1iving away from home.
2. That in addition the parental c o n t r i b u t i o n s w i l l not be
adjusted to take account of i n f l a t i o n , meaning a large
increase i n the amount parents w i l l be expected to
contribute and taking many more parents over the earnings
l i m i t for the f i r s t time.
3. That about 75% of students who should r e c e i v e a p a r e n t a l
c o n t r i b u t i o n do not r e c e i v e the f u l l amount from t h e i r
parents and consequently have to l i v e on l e s s than the
f u l l grant.
ICU B e l i e v e s :
1. That i d e a l l y a l l students should r e c e i v e a f u l l grant,
and that the government should be moving i n the
d i r e c t i o n of reducing parental c o n t r i b u t i o n s rather than
i n c r e a s i n g them.
2. That an increase of only 4% would anyway t o t a l l y f a i l to
maintain the value of the grant.
ICU Resolves:
1. Not to go on ' s t r i k e ' .
2. To campaign f o r the b e l i e f s above.
ICU I n s t r u c t s :
The President and E.A.O, to take every opportunity to
further the b e l i e f s above, i n conjunction with the U n i v e r s i t y
of London Union and other Student Unions.
