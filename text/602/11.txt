Industrial
Howdy folks! Firstly, thanks to all those who
came to the A S T M S talk last week; and also to
the Editor—his inclusion of all our publicity
made the event more successful than some
past talks!
• O u r next major event has wider than usual
appeal: unless the Miners (not RSM!) strike,
Ian Ross will tell all about life as B B C Industrial
C o r r e s p o n d e n t o n F r i d a y , J a n u a r y 29 at
12:50pm in C h e m Eng Theatre 1. Watch out
for him on T V in the meantime!
Plus....Today at 1:00pm is our Committee
Meeting in C h e m Eng Concourse: all officers,
vice-officers and interested parties please note.
Consoc
Next Thursday, January 28, T i m Linacre, the
N a t i o n a l C h a i r m a n of the F e d e r a t i o n of
Conservative Students, will be speaking to
Consoc. Meeting in the Upper Lounge (next to
the Union Office) at 1:00pm. H e will be talking
on F C S ' s role in liasing with the party, the
government and relations with N U S .
We regret that this meeting can only be
open to Conservative Society members.
Ents
So we're off to a flying start to term 2, with the
party tonight featuring Walter Mitty's Little
White Lies! Have you bought your ticket yet?
It's another 25p on the door so the Ents Room
or the Union Office would be useful ports of
call to fill that deficiency. But that's not all!
Next Friday sees our Hard Rock soiree with
Overkill and Blue M a x providing the culture.
It's only £1 per ticket so we expect to see you
there. Throw in such infinitely entertaining
films (this week Kentucky Fried Movie) and
more surprise events to come and you can see
that Ents is the place to be in 1982.
Badgesoc
At last, Badgesoc is ready, organised and raring
to go. 2,000 badge bits are a r r i v i n g this
Wednesday to keep us going for a month or
two. After last term's X m a s Bonfire a n d
Badge sale, well over £60 is in the can, all going
to charity. W e still need someone, however,
willing to return the wire bin from Beit Q u a d
back to Hyde Park.
F r o m n o w o n B a d g e s o c m e e t s e v e r y
Monday at 12:45pm in the Lounge above
Southside Bar. B u y badgebits, enrol, get new
ideas for stunningly original badges, have a
"pie & a pint", discuss pressing questions such
as: should we give the money we collected to
Rag or to T W S ? All these and more, Mondays,
12:45pm, Southside.
Don't forget, to join up, send 50p to Lee
Mercer c/o M e c h Eng or come to a meeting.

Issues Denial
A spokesman said yesterday: " O n behalf of the
Astrosoc committee I would like to deny
categorically the allegations in T u e s d a y ' s
Times. There is absolutely no cause for worry
by any of our members, we have never had
even one member asleep during any of our
lectures. W e feel this was irresponsible of the
Times and will cause needless anxiety for
countless thousands of astronomers every
where. It would appear that there have been
two or three cases in the North American
continent, and now it has been blown out of all
proportion by this article."
There will be an observing meeting next
Wednesday at 3:30pm in the "Wave-guide" in
the P h y s i c s B u i l d i n g , w i t h a d v i c e o n
astronomical photography, and the oppor
tunity to use these techniques afterwards
(weather permitting, of course!). The following
lectures have already been arranged for this
term:
Tues Feb 9: Prof J Taylor asking " C a n we
unify gravity With the other forces of nature?
Tues Feb 23: D r J . M . Irvin speaking o n
"Neutron Stars".
Tues March 2: Dr Joseph speaking on " I R A S " .
Tues March 9: D r Raine F R S speaking on
"The Superstructures of the Universe".
Thurs March 18: D r R . L . F . B o y d F R S
speaking on " T h e Solar Atmosphere".
Tues March 23: D r I s h a m s p e a k i n g o n
"Quantum Gravity".
A l l these lectures will be at 6:30pm i n
Physics Lecture Theatre 2.
O n l y a small column this week 'cos the
weather's been bad again. Don't forget: A l l

U n i v e r s i t y at t h e C h a r r i n g ! o n B o w l ,
Tolworth.
T h e A team (Cook, Harrison, Hooper,
M a n , M c M u t l a n ) mashed the opposition in
the first game with Dick Hooper scoring 209.
T h e y f o l l o w e d t h i s u p w i t h a n o t h e r
comprehensive w i n in the second game but
the third was a much more exciting affair
with A n d y M c M u l l a n scoring 17 in the last
frame to w i n the game by 2 pins and the
match overall.
T h e B team (Moye, Short, Smith, T h o n g ,
W e l l s ) p e r f o r m e d w e l l a g a i n s t s t r o n g
opposition but only managed to w i n one
game. However, in the match overall this
game proved to be vital.
The real heroes ol the day were the C team
(Dale, Davis, G r i m w o o d , Q u i n n , Stanley)
who won all their games, so becoming the
lirst I C C team to w i n for ten years. T h e
highlight of the match was the 182 scored by
A n d y Davis in the second game (unheard of
by a C team player) which together with
excellent, well above average performances
by a l l his team-mates gave a total of 733,
beating both I C and Southampton B team
scores and becoming one of the best scores by
a C team in this year's national student
league.
T h e ladies match was forfeited by I C as
only M a r i e Cheong turned up but her moral
support was much appreciated by a l l .
Next match is tomorrow (Jan 23) against
B r u n e i U n i v e r s i t y a l T o l w o r t h , r o l l - o f f
