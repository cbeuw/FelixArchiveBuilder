Dear Sir
Andrew Lyall's reply to my
letter was the p r e d i c t a b l e
outburst of feigned hurt that I
expected. His allegations are
nothing short of slanderous
and are no doubt the release
for t h e e m o t i o n a l s t r a i n
imposed upon one who has
lived in a building that is
collapsing around his ears for
five years.
Not surprisingly he makes
us s c a p e g o a t s for the i n -
competence of Weeks H a l l
residents and lays the ills of
the w o r l d at the doors of
Garden H a l l . H e complained
that my letter was not based
on facts and then proceeds to
make wild and unsubstantial
allegations himself.
It is more than likely that a
W e e k s H a l l r e s i d e n t put
w a s h i n g p o w d e r i n t o the
drying machine. This would
in turn explain M r A l l Ly's
observation that damp wash-
ing was removed from the
drier, as the average Weeks
H a l l r e s i d e n t c a n n o t d i s -
tinguish between the washing
m a c h i n e a n d the d r i e r he
p r o b a b l y saw the clothes
b e i n g r e m o v e d f r o m the
washing machine and mistook
it for the drier!
Indeed I myself can cite one
occasion on which I removed
a c o m b a t jacket from the
drier and burnt my fingers on
it because it had been left in
for far too long!
The state of Garden Hall's
laundry is not the fault of the
present residents and indeed
it could not possibly be as
it has been out of action since
the summer. T h e damage was
caused by tenants to whom
the rooms were let over the
summer. Besides breaking the
w a s h i n g m a c h i n e a n d the
drier they also stole the iron
for good measure.
Andrew Lyall has the nerve
to suggest that we apologise
for damage caused by Weeks
hall residents. I suggest that
he apologise to the residents of
Garden H a l l for the damage
he has i n f l i c t e d u p o n our
characters by depicting us as
nothing more than vandals
and criminals.

I read in F E L I X 601 M r
Twadowski's letter informing
your readers of my somewhat
unsocial working hours and
remcmlier well the incident to
which he refers.
O f course I appreciate that
a bicycle is the most economi-
cal way to travel at 5:00am,
and also that M r Twadowski
had to u n l o c k his bicycle
before pedalling it off into the
night, but with a hacksaw?

the following letter which is

To all tutors.

ports the College with around
£ 0 0 -
In these d a y s o f severe

•that everyone who will be
giving a lecture course during
the academic year gives the

supply the "recommended"
textbooks.
T o enable us to do this, it is
of the utmost importance that
we know what books you will
be recommending before the
course starts, not as is happen-
ing now, telling us after the
course has started. This is not
fair to your students or to the
Bookshop. We try very hard
to stock a l l r e c o m m e n d e d

with your help.

Dear Mark
I would like to draw a small
matter to the attention of the
student populace of IC. So
here goes
D i d you k n o w that the
U n i o n has been a l l o c a t e d
approx £150 to buy fiction
works and magazines for the
Haldane Librarv? I repeat,
^750 of Y O U R M O N E Y to
buy books for Y O U R plea-
sure and perusal. So, if you
w a n t t o r e a d t h e l a t e s t
i n t e r n a t i o n a l b e s t s e l l i n g
b l o c k b u s t e r or s o m e t h i n g
more literary such as " M y
Friend, M r Leakey" (Barney
McCabe's favourite) without
having to shell out for it, then
this is what you do. Either fill
i n a request f o r m i n the
Haldane Library or drop a
note into my pigeonhole. I
a w a i t y o u r requests w i t h
interest.

Dear Sir
I ' d l i k e to m a k e a few-
observations about last week's
'Soapbox' article.
Frankly, it seems to me that
Frank James is contradicting
h i m s e l f . H e a c c u s e s the
Creationists of meglomania
(though for the life of me I
can't see why!) and of i n -
tolerance of d e v i a t i o n a n d
pluralism of belief; and yet,
while he grants the right of
free belief to all, he strongly
objects to the C r e a t i o n i s t s
daring to state their unortho-
dox views.
As to the absurdity of such
ideas: has it ever occurred to
h i m to w o n d e r w h y the
b i b l i c a l o r d e r of C r e a t i o n
(Genesis 1 vs 1-26) is exactly
the same as the o r d e r of
evolution of life that he holds
as true? Remembering that
the Hebrew for 'day' may also
be translated 'age', and that
the Bible was never written as
a science textbook, the simi-
larity is really quite remark-
able.
O f course, if such views are
so absurd why suppress them,
since suppression will only
strengthen them. W h y not
give the Creationists their say,
s i n c e s u r e l y n o - o n e w i l l
believe them.
A point worth noting is tha:
D a r w i n is p r o b a b l y not
revolving in his pine box. H e
was a C h r i s t i a n , and said
himself that he saw no reason
w h v his t h e o r i e s s h o u l d
disturb a Christian's view-
point, and I agree with him.
F r a n k J a m e s m a y l i k e to
choose to be an animal; but I
believe that G o d made me,
and that's really something to
be proud of.

Dear Sir
The Wisden-like recall of
great I C cricket events by
K e n Weale ( F E L I X , Oct 23
1981) should be extended in
the style of other noteworthy
s t a t i s t i c i a n s s u c h as B i l l
Frindall. Weale is correct in
stating that Dwarf, Gnome
a n d S t u m p y C h i m p have
scored centuries on the Devon
tour. But can he actually be
unaware that of these elfin
batsmen one, Gnome, per-
formed the feat t w i c e — i n
successive innings? Surely a
detail of immense significance.
Should any aspiring centur-
ion believe that the necessary
prerequisite is to have ac-
quired a similarly picturesque
appellation, he will be dis-
couraged to learn that in an
era even more lost in the mists
of time than that of D w a r f
and Gnome, the magic score
was a c h i e v e d by someone
with the lacklustre name of
Bland. Wisden' Weale will
correct me if I am wrong.
