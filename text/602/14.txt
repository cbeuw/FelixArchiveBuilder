QEC.
The r e v i s e d d r a f t Staternent of Intent which met with general
approval at the Emergency UGM was passed by our Board of
Governors. However, i t was r e j e c t e d by QEC1
s equivalent
body. Negotiations are c o n t i n u i n g .
I have w r i t t e n t o the V i c e - C h a n c e l l o r of the. U n i v e r s i t y
seeking assurances on o v e r a l l student numbers etc.
Overseas Students Fees.
We have been given an i d e a l opportunity to p u b l i c i s e the
f i n a n c i a l problems faced by overseas students. The Union i s
making a half-hour TV programme f o r BBC 2's Open Door series,
I have s e t up a small committee t o co-ordinate production
but would anybody who f e e l s they have something u s e f u l to
o f f e r towards the programme please see me.
R e f e c t o r i e s .
The Hoiland Club Refectory operation has been closed down. I
am i n t e r e s t e d t o know whether or not the Holland Club w i l l
take on t h e i r own c a t e r i n g .
The hours of s e r v i c e i n many r e f e c t o r i e s have changed and
these have been reported i n F e l i x .
The Southside Refectory i s to move downstairs and at the
time of w r i t i n g work i s under way to improve the Lower
Refectory. This move w i l l put the o u t l e t nearer the kitchen
and should improve the q u a l i t y of the food.
The s t y l e of s e r v i c e i n the r e f e c t o r i e s has changed. The
Buttery has a c o l d meat and s a l a d bar and a g r e a t l y
increased range of sandwiches. The innovat ions were
l a r g e l y i n response t o the survey so we hope they w i l l prove
popular. Souths]de s e r v i c e should a l s o change o f f e r i n g both
" f a s t food" and "meat and two veg" type meal. The Union and
Sherfie,Id Main w i l l not change g r e a t l y but we are hoping f o r
an improvemeut i n q u a l i t y , agai n i n response t o survey
r e s u l t s .
If any of these changes do not take place, l e t me o r Marco
know e i t h e r d i r e c t l y or through the Suggest ions and
Complaints box. We s t i l l r e l y on student feed-back
BARS.
A major refurbishment of the bar counter area i n Southside
i s t a k i n g place. The operation i s being financed through
brewery loans. Most of the work should have been done over
the v a c a t i o n - the f i t t i n g company using the excuse o f bad
weather f o r not doing so. I can only apologise f o r any
inconvenience caused and hope that the end r e s u l t i s worth-
while .
E l e c t i o n s (Ho, Ho!)
It i s t r a d i t i o n a l f o r the President at t h i s time of year t o
o f f e r t o d i s c u s s the j o b with people f o o l enough t o want t o
Ho the job next year. So, budding hacks out there, see me
i f you are c o n s i d e r i n g standing. The j o b i s open to any
member of the Union so give the matter some thought. Marco
has d e t a i l s of the a c t u a l e l e c t i o n procedure.
HONORARY SECRETARY'S REPORT.
The Blue Book.
The Blue Book contains the C o n s t i t u t i o n s and Standing
Orders of the Union Committees and also the Union By-Laws.
These are always being changed from year t o year and the
Book needs t o be r e g u l a r l y updated. In the past the Book
was published each year and had to by typed out from scratch
on s t e n c i l s and gestetnered.
I am i n the process of t r y i n g to get the Book put on a word
processor which would make a l t e r a t i o n s much simpler and
updated copies could be run o f f at any time. Word processor
f a c i l i t i e s are a v a i l a b l e i n C o l l e g e but there are no s t a f f
a v a i l a b l e t o do the a c t u a l work of typing the Book i n . If
there i s anyone i n t e r e s t e d i n l e a r n i n g how to use a word
processor at a cost of a few hours typing w i l l they please
contact me i n the Union O f f i c e .
I n t e r n a t i o n a l Conference of Students of Technology.
T h i s years INCOST was due to be held i n Poland and plans
were s t i l l going ahead up u n t i l the onset of m a r t i a l law.
Since then no news has been heard and i t seems u n l i k e l y
now that the conference w i l l be held there. A l t e r n a t i v e
plans are going ahead t o t r y and set up the conference i n
Sweden. We wi11 be sending a delegation of students where-
ever the venue. So anyone who wants t o go should come and
see me and I ' l l give them f u r t h e r information.
