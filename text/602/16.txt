ISLAMIC WEEK
The Creator and His Creation 1
Theory
It has only been In the last
hundred or so years that scien-
tists have been able to theorise
with any authority about the
origins of the earth and life on It.
That Is, In effect, only "yester-
day", If the history of mankind Is
thought of as having spanned a
single year.
And their discoveries have
revolutionized Western man's
conceptions—so that he is no
longer in awe of the untamed
natural world around him, and is
even sceptical as to existence of a
Supreme Being. Thus he con-
siders it unnecessary to submit
himself to the will of God (except
in a most limited and perfunctory
way on a Sunday). For all the
earth's greatest mysteries have
been reduced by the scientists to
a material—rational cause and
effect which neutralizes the
necessity to submit oneself in
fear and hope to any divinity.
Reasoning
We Muslims believe, and can
prove using the valued "reason-
ing" employed by the sciences,
that Western man's complacency
with regard to the Supreme
Being, God, is based upon a
complete misinterpretation of the
facts about the universe which
have been discovered. Further-
more, it is due to the unwarranted
egoism which resulted from the
advances in scientific knowledge.
If one were to ask a scientist to
opine about how our universe,
our earth and the life upon it
came into being; his answer
would be that the consensus of
opinion has it as follows:
Billion BC
"Billions of years ago our universe
was a single piece of matter,
there was then a Big Bang in the
centre of this lump: the result of
which was that a lot of energy
was produced. This coagulated
into the stars, which then them-
selves gave birth to the heavier
elements. Thus our solar system
came into being as well as other
galaxies. Since there was no
resistance in space to that
primordial momentum generated
by the explosion, the stars and
the planets remained in regular
orbits."
Note the materialist cause and
effect that excludes the notion of
Supreme Being or Creator or
God.
Biology
Similarly, if we were to ask the
biologists about the origins of life
on earth, he would reply that the
latest scientific techniques have
enabled scientists to hypothesise
with some authority that all life
evolved from water. Thus (to>
precis the most consistantly
expounded theory): In the young
primeval atmosphere of the
earth there were a lot of elements
like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen
floating about along with a
tremendous amount of electrical
activity. It is thought that the
combination of these with the
"Primeval Soup" lying around the
rocks and oceans of the young
earth, produced iife; the primeval
matter in the sea generating the
protoplasm out of which came
the amoeba and then all living
things.
Both theories: of the origin of
the universe and origin of life on
the earth are regarded as scien-
tific "fact" in the West, and indeed
is taught as such in schools. The
biblical account of creation in
Genesis is considered a myth and
the onus is on the believers in
God to prove the rationality of
their faith—something they have
hitherto failed to do.
In Islam there is no dichotomy
between faith and reason; thus to
us it seems that the scientists of
the West have not in the past
hundred or so years discovered
anything new about the universe
that undermines a belief in God,
in fact it is just the opposite; they
have at this late stage merely
confirmed what God revealed of
his creation to mankind 1400
years ago.
How? Well, if one was to ask
the astronomers who know so
much about the universe's origins
whether it would have been
possible for an illiterate Arab
living over 1400 years ago in the
Arabian Desert to know his
scientific facts about the universe,
he would retort in the negative
with some vehemence. Yet look
at what Muhammed (peace be
upon him), born in 570AD was
saying under the inspiration of
God:
"Do not the Unbelievers (aetheists
and agnostics) see,
That the Heavens and the Earth
Were joined together (as one unit
of creation)
Before we clove them asunder."
(from the Koran/the Prophets)
and:
"And it is He (God) who created,
the Night and the Day,
the Sun and the Moon
All move along; each in its orbit."
(from Koran/The Prophets)
And again, with regard to the
origins of life on the earth, the
biologists whose theories about
the origins of life are regarded as
fact, would not credit it that some-
one living over 1400 years ago
would know what he knows only
now; yet Muhammed (upon
whom be peace) said under the
inspiration of God:
"And We made from water
Every living thing
Will they then not believe?"
(Koran/Prophets)
and:
"O Mankind
If you are in doubt concerning
the Resurrection,
We created you from dust
then from a drop of seed
then from a clot
then from a iittle lump of flesh,
shapely and shapeless
that we may make it clear for you
And We cause what We will to
remain
In the womb for an appointed
time."
(Koran/The Pilgrimage)
Thus we can see that scientists,
have at this late stage merely
confirmed what God revealed of
his creation to man all those 1400
years ago. Thus there is no
warrant for the scepticism about
a divinity brought on in the West
by these scientific theories rather
than the logical conclusion to be
drawn from the theories is that
Author and Prime Mover of the
Big Bang and the Water from
which we came into being is
worthy of our submission and
praise. For otherwise we would
have to accept the preposterous
implications of the scientists'
theories: that random Chance
Operation was the lynchpin that
instigated our universe.
"Life" whatever your opinion of
it, must be self-replicating—be
able to reproduce itself over and ,
over again. DNA is the basis of
life and is an incredibly compli-
cated structure, a double helix
with millions of atoms arranged
in a special code of four letters.
Consider the complexities of
D N A ' s self-replication — u n -
winding, its intricate form to
divide into two seperate indivi-
duals which then each find exact
replicas to attach themselves to
in what has been called a "zipping
up" operation. This being pos-
sible because there was a yet
more infinitesimally intricate
process at work, instigated by the
catalyst enzymes acting as a
"biomachine" for the DNA. So
intricate and infinitely complex
are the forces at the basis of
life—yet we are asked this was
the product of a random process,
without external inspiration!
It is not an exaggeration to say
that it is like being asked to
accept that a tornado blowing
through a scrapyard could pro-
duce a typewriter in whose
carriage was a full instruction
sheet describing how to make
another typewriter. And not only
that but the tornado produced all
the tools essential to make that
typewriter!!
Surely this is too improbable
and has to be dismissed. Then
there is the Sir Fred Hoyle theory
that evolution commenced in
deep space and then genes
showered onto the earth mixed
with the primeval soup to start
life. Sir Fred claims that a super
intelligent computer in deep
space planning, executing and
controlling all life. If that is so
who designed and made that
computer in deep space. For a
Muslim the answer is easy, it
is
"God there is no God but He, the
living, the self-subsisting eternal.
No slumber can cease Him nor
sleep. His are all things in the
Heavens and the Earth. None can
intercede in His presence except
as He wills. He knows what
appears to His creatures in the
past, present and future. None
can encompass. His knowledge
except as He wills. His throne
does extend over the Heavens
and the Earth and He feels no
fatigue in guarding and pre-
serving it, for He is the most High,
the Supreme in Glory.
Al-Koran (ll;255)
