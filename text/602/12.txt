Southside Penthouse Problem
Not a word from the Southside Wardens,
although I am informed that D r Jowitt thinks
I'm just "Jowitt bashing". If he really considers
the matter so childishly, I can see we'll never
reach a satisfactory solution. This matter will
not just disappear. Nick M o r t o n has suggested
that the current residents should ignore the
condition that they should gain access from
the Tizard gallery level.

Shock Treatment. Certificate A. Directed
by Jim Sharman. Starring Jessica Harper,
Cliff de Young, Richard O'Brien, Barry
Humphries.
Many expected Rocky Horror Show 2, but
rather than a mere re-work of all too familiar
material, writer Richard O'Brien has applied
his talents to the strange world of television for
his latest musical comedy production Shock
Treatment.
Brad and Janet survive to become part of
the community of Denton, where television is
so dominant that the whole town is depicted as
a T V studio whose inhabitants are players in
soap operas and quiz games. This brilliant

Brad and Janet fall victim to the talents of
Since sabbatical elections will soon be here, I
felt that now would be a good time to advise
any potential c a n d i d a t e s of the qualities
needed in a successful Union Exec. (FELIX
Editor, a more delicate issue altogether, will be
reserved for a later puzzle.)
A s far as his job is concerned, an Exec
member should be dedicated, enthusiastic and
versatile. Personal qualities are essential too:
c h e e r f u l n e s s , friendliness a n d wit are all
important qualities in a Union Officer. INo one
could consider himself suitable for an Exec
post unless he was blessed with at least two of
the industrious qualities I have mentioned, and
at least two of the personal qualities. In fact,
for a balanced Exec, each feature should be
found in just two of the three members.
The President, of course, needs to be witty.
The Deputy President, who must be versatile,
should be enthusiastic or witty, but not both.
A n d the Exec should not contain more than
one person who is both dedicated and witty,
nor should there be more than one member
who is cheerful and enthusiastic.
What qualities are required in the H o n Sec?

Last Week's Solution
McOatup's caber has four perforations, and
there are three possible arrangements for
them along the length of the pole: 1+1+4+4+3
or 1+3+1+6+2 or 1+5+3+2+2. Of the thirteen
people who found one or more of these, A .
Shiekh, Physics 2, is the lucky winner.
A n d now, the rest of the solutions to the
Christmas puzzles.
Call My Bluff
angekkok, monotroch, monostich, paneity,
giaour, st, gju and euoi are all in Chambers'
Dictionary, and are perfectly acceptable in
Scrabble. Euoi, st and gju are even useful on
occasion. Posteeen is in the dictionary, and I
suppose that makes it permissible, even though
it is a m i s p r i n t ; it s h o u l d read 'posteen'.
Nunatakkr is another misprint (should be
' n u n a t a k k e r ' ) but this one is definitely
disallowed, since it is marked as Swedish.
F i n a l l y , ' s w e d e ' is n o t a l l o w e d s i n c e ,
Bert Schnick (Barry Humphries), the blind
host of a marriage counselling show. H e
convinces Janet to send Brad for treatment in
D e n t o n v a l e , a m e d i c a l series r u n by the
suspect duo Cosmo and Nation McKinley.
Meanwhile, unknown to both lovers, evil fast
food king Farley Flavors is plotting to make
Janet a star and steal her from Brad to settle
an old score.
Jessica Harper is well cast as Janet (as is the
amazing Barry Humphries as Schnick). She
proves that she has a fine voice in the musical
numbers and also manages to always look
entirely convincing. The film moves at a rapid
pace which can be confusing, but the variety of
i m a g e s a n d the c a t c h y l y r i c s holds the
attention well. A s a musical it is not perfect,
but it displays an inventiveness and wit which
is all too rare nowadays.

Taking Notes
Writing ' U ' for 'up', ' D ' for 'down', etc.,the
following solution takes 83 moves. Move each
piece as far as possible in the d i r e c t i o n

Conway, who showed me the puzzle, also
showed me an even harder one along the same
lines; I'm saving it for the next time someone
complains that the puzzles are too easy.
