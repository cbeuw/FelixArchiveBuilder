T h e n e x t e d i t o r , D a v e S u g d e n , then
published in no. 304 what he hoped would be,
and now is, the F E L I X of the future. He
described that proposals for a weekly FELIX,
produced by a sabbatical editor would be put
before Publications Board.
Sabbaticals
Obviously this was agreed although it was
not prominently exposed in FELIX. Sugden's
final edition, 310, included a credit for Dolly
Owson and a warning of apathy (surprise!)
while 311, produced by the Union H o n Sec,
had the following on the back page.

" F e l i x " E d i t o r
The following year Sugden's visions of
F E L I X were realised with Dowson as the first
weekly, paid Editor. He also edited Sennet
(now London Student) at the same time and
introduced a FEEIX FINANCIA££Y page.
Visually his (and the next year's) F E L I C E S
were boring, being tabloid size, printed on a
s i m i l a r q u a l i t y of p a p e r a n d l a c k i n g in
photographs. Dave Sugden's prediction of
apathy proved very true, there being four
elections for President that year. This gave
Dowson the opportunity for one of several
h e a d l i n e s s p a n n i n g two i s s u e s . N o . 315
referred to the first election saying "Abstain".
" A n d They D i d " being the headline of no. 316.
Back to Front
H o w e v e r , not everything followed in a
logical sequence: in no. 314 under the title
"Porn: A Communist Plot" was a photo of the
stripper of 301 before removing her bra, while
no. 315 showed shots of Motor Show models
from various illuminating angles. Copies of
these four photos will be on view in the FELIX
Office for a nominal charge during this week.
The front page of no. 336 had a " F E L I X
Editor Threatened with Castration" (by Union
Sec for leaking election results) caption, but
much more seriously were the events reported
on the cover of no. 337: "Where are our Rag
Mags? , F E L I X Ed Censured—But Resig-
nation Bid Fails". This described the blunders
made by Dowson in having Mike Williams' Rag
Mags printed. Council had made Dowson print
a letter from Williams on the front page,
although in the a c c o m p a n y i n g report no
elaboration was given on how P. Jowitt
(Deputy President) had succeeded in dragging
numerous parts of M r Dowson's private life
into the argument. Williams was later to follow
Dowson as F E L I X Editor. This issue also
i n c l u d e d the f o l l o w i n g insert about an
Improbable College.
In his epilogue Oily answered criticisms of
his F E L I X by stating news was up to 25%,
adding that the following Editor planned more,
suggested U G M s be named Socsoc meetings
( r e m a r k i n g how S o c s o c no l o n g e r h e l d
meetings of their own) and claimed C C U s
were destroying I C U .

content and his replacement by P. Wadsworth
who was both F E L I X Editor and H o n Sec for
two of the t h r e e t e r m s of the session.
Wadsworth, in his 358 editorial, explained he
only wrote editorials when he ran out of copy
and criticised several of his staff for being
biased. The session ended with D P , D .
Sinclair, resigning his post near the end of his
term in office because he had not been
awarded a U G A .
During this time IC played host to many big
name bands and solo acts, either in the Great
Hall or in Carnival gigs held at outside venues
like the Albert Hall. These included Deep
Purple, Donovan (a real money-spinner), Elton
John, Queen and L o u Reed. This last gig
coinciding with a pick-up in the drug scene.
This week's advert is for the first of two Pink
Floyd gigs at IC.
