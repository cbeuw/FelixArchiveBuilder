producer lo discuss the matter.
This ended a period ol silence on
the pari of Auntie Beeh; two
years have passed since the then
Hon Secretary Roger Stotesbury
submitted the application.
O p e n Door will allow students
here to make a programme about
virtually anything. A film crew
and studio facilities are to be
used, with the B B C paying the
b i l l . S e e m i n g l y , n e i t h e r the
c o n t e n t n o r the s t y l e o f the
programme have definitely been
decided yet.
Onlv six weeks between the
d a t e of n o t i f i c a t i o n a n d the
actual transmission is given by
O p e n Door. So I C should be
broadcasting to the nation at
some time this term.

Lectures to
cease?
There is a possibility that the
Tuesday lunchtime Humanities
l e c t u r e p r o g r a m m e w i l l be
suspended for the next session.
The Humanities Committee
has been asked by College to
submit a plan for a twenty per
cent reduction in expenditure
over a three year period. T h e
plan includes suspension of the
Tuesday lunchtime lectures and
a reduction in language classes.
However, I he plans have not
yet been implemented and may
be avoided, if possible.
Nuclear War
Beginning at the END
Last Tuesday lunchtime, a crowd of about 200 gathered to hear
Professor Robert Neild, Prof of Economics, Cambridge
University give the first of a series of lunchtime lectures under
the title 'Nuclear War in Europe'.
Prof N e i l d began by recalling the recent rise of interest in nuclear
disarmament due lo the non-ratification of S A L T 2 , the planned
installation of C r u i s e missiles in E u r o p e , the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, and the election of President Reagan.
W h e n N A T O was originally formed in 1949 there was a big
imbalance in conventional forces between the still heavily armed
Soviet U n i o n and the economically weak Western European states, the
idea being that A m e r i c a n nuclear forces would compensate lor this
with massive 'retaliation' in the event of Russian invasion of Western
Europe. Since then, the U n i t e d States has lost its nuclear dominance,'
and smaller, tactical nuclear weapons have been developed—both
lac tors leading to the possibility that Europe would be sacrificed using
such devices rather than the U S mounting 'massive retaliation'.
R u s s i a n t h r e a t
T h e r e are two views of the R u s s i a n threat, a c c o r d i n g to the
i rolessor. O n e is the ' I s l a m i c ' v i e w p o i n t — that the R u s s i a n s
continually want to expand by invasion, and the other the 'ripe fruit'
theory—that the Russians wait for capitalist collapse and revolution to
bring C o m m u n i s t governments to power, w h i c h can then be "helped"
by intervention. T h e 'ripe fruit' theory, he said, is the more accurate,
apart from the case of E. Europe, w h i c h was occupied during WW2
and is now a buffer zone against the West. In fact, the situation is
rather reassuring in W . Europe, since these countries are properous,
and there is little chance of Communist revolution. But in E. Europe,
central planning and oppression has failed, leading Prof Neild to
conclude that the Soviet forces there are lor garrison purposes against
local revolt rather than for offensive anti-Western reasons. The only
chance of the U S and the Soviet U n i o n coming to blows is over "Third
W o r l d involvement—but even this would tend to be at armslength.
C o m p a r i n g the policies of deterrence and defence, he saw deterrence as
being analogous to a r m i n g yourself with a sword, to frighten your
opponent, and thus provoking him to arm himself Purely defensive
policies (as practised by Switzerland and Sweden, say) he saw as a
shield, without threat to anyone but an invader, and this not sparking
an arms race.
Next Tuesday, Field Marshall the L o r d Carver, is lo talk on
" N u c l e a r Weapons in E u r o p e " as the next part of this series.

The third discussion document
p u b l i s h e d t h i s w e e k by the
U n i v e r s i t i e s C o m m i t t e e o n
Academic Organisation other-
wise known as the Swinnerton-
Dver C o m m h t e e recommends
that the University of L o n d o n
R e a c t o r C e n t r e ( U L R C ) at
S i l w o o d P a r k s h o u l d b e c o m e
part of Imperial College.
T h e committee, after looking
at possible r a t i o n a l i z a t i o n of
colleges in its first two discussion
documents, has now examined
the c e n t r a l a c t i v i t i e s of the
university. These include U L R C .
the Senate Institutes, the central
library facilities, U L U and the
central administration, amongst
other things.
In the case of the r e a c t o r
centre which is already managed
a n d m a i n l y used by IC:, the
suggestion is for IC1
. to take over
the c e n t r e e n t i r e l y , r e c e i v i n g
e x t r a g r a n t to c o v e r r u n n i n g
costs. It is hoped that costs could
be reduced by selling services to
outside users. T h e current cost of
,£220.000 per year could, it is
suggested, be 50% covered by
such income.

Editorial Board decides
T h e Editorial Board of I C O N ,
the Imperial College Review,
have decided to suspend publica-
t i o n i n d e f i n i t e l y d u e to the
current financial situation.
In the last issue, which will be
published on February 5, they
state that they no longer feel that
they are justified in asking for a
subsidy from College funds and
that the decision was entirely
theirs. T h e y were not forced to
cease publication by pressures
from College, they state.
T h e l a s t i s s u e c o n t a i n s ,
amongst other things, reviews of
the Alfred L a m m e r print display
in the Consort Gallery, the R C S
Centenary Concert given by I C
Orchestra, the Operatic Society

C h u r c h , Piccadilly and the I C
C h o i r Christmas Concert.
T h e section on student facili-
ties is f u l l o f p r a i s e for the
U n i v e r s i t y of L o n d o n U n i o n
( U L U ) . After mentioning the
part played by U L U in repre-
senting students on the Senate, ii
examines the trading activities.
T h e conclusion is " T h e U n i o n
building seems to us one of the
most efficient and economical
institutions in the U n i v e r s i t y . "
Thus no further cuts are recom-
mended for U L U .
The d o c u m e n t is also very
c o m p l i m e n t a r y to I C , w h i l s t
j u s t i f y i n g t h e d i r e c t U G C
funding, which the College alone
in the University enjoys. " F o r a
generation it has been national
p o l i c y to b u i l d u p I m p e r i a l
College to be one of the foremost
s c i e n t i f i c a n d t e c h n o l o g i c a l
institutions in the world—to be
Britain's counterpart to M I T . "
A n d , i n the w o r d s of L o r d

having willed the end, must will
the means."
