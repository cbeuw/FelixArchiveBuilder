Take a walk down
F E L R O A D
T h e years between 1967 a n d 1974 were
notable for many lay-out and organisational
changes. A t the start F E L I X was retailing
fortnightly for 4d and edited by whoever was
willing to devote enough time to it and study
for a degree at the same time. B y October
1974 it was the weekly, free F E L I X you now
know, having undergone several changes in
cost, size and particularly editorial style.
The 1967/8 F E L I X was approximately twice
the size of the one before but still managed to
average ten pages u n d e r three different
editors. It was a year of inquorate U G M s ,
bitter Council arguments and heralded the
ambivalent attitude of wanting more women at
IC yet simultaneously begrudging them access
to the U n i o n B a r . C h r i s t m a s presents in
F E L I X also started that vear. these being cut-
outs, joss sticks, Christmas cards and later
grass, a 'pill', balloons and Christmas tree
lights.
Police Brutality
O c t o b e r 1968 (no. 264) i n t r o d u c e d yet
another page size and the first headline was
the excellent " F u z z Bust Hash". However the
headline did not refer to the flourishing College
drug-scene at the time but to Javad 'Adolf
Hashteroudion, R C S U Vice-President. He was
attending a Vietnam demonstration at Park
Lane the July before when he was charged
with throwing stones at a policeman although
'Hash' claimed to be in the middle of the demo,
writing poetry! However, the situation was not
at all amusing for Hash, as he was held in
police custody for a time and eventually fined
Â£25 (plus 10 guineas cost) and given a three-
month suspended sentence.
The price went up to 6d for 1969/70, the first
issue being no. 272 which marked the start of
another trend for picture covers. This trend
continued until no. 281 (cover: a wall with a
'FELIX Road' sign) when using both R C S
Broadsheet and Council as a forum the R S M U
President criticised the 'wasted front page and
generally poor quality of the last issue'. This
along with what was termed 'not only a waste
of space but a far more dangerous waste than
the photo of the F E L I X Road sign,' in the
R S M U n e w s l e t t e r a n d the c r i t i c a l a n d
unhelpful attitude of Council caused Malcolm
Williamson to announce his resignation in the
editorial of no. 282 Ian Carr took over for no.
285, the first of the seventies, with the C C U
sheets vs FELIX antagonism still rife. In the
previous issue R C S Broadsheet had claimed to
be more chatty and up-to-date whilst replying
in another letter Dave Chant (soon to be third
editor of the traumatic 1969/70 session)
explained this was due to the perennial lack of
staff.
O n a lighter note, no. 287 included a letter
ratings girls from JC, IF, Maria Assumpta
Kings Road, London, Glasgow and Edinburgh
on an ascending scale of neutral, moderately
pretty, beautiful, pretty and very pretty. The
letter was signed Paris.

The headline of the following issue "Penney
Drops A A " referring to how after eight years
of negotiations, Lord Penney, the Rector had
announced there would be no merger between
I C a n d the A r c h i t e c t u r e A s s o c i a t i o n .
T h e 1970/1 session was uneventful by
comparison; the price dropped to 272
d for
nos. 299 to 301, editor J . Rogers including
the first topless F E L I X female in 301. He
e x p l a i n e d in 302 why that and all future
F E L I C E S would be free (therefore this is the
301st free FELIX).
