VVcalc himself was already
the centrepiece of many IC
cricketing legends by the m i d -
1950s. Most of these, however,
w e r e not q u a n t i f i a b l e in
numerical terms or, if they
w e r e , t h e n u m b e r s w e r e
g e n e r a l l y q u i t e l o w . T h e
qualitative aspects were rich
in humour and drama and I
trust that these have been
passed on from generation to
g e n e r a t i o n at p o s t - m a t c h
convivialities.
They were memorable days
indeed!

Dear Sir
I, J . J . Seymour Cole, being
of s o u n d body a n d m i n d ,
hereby, due to unforseen cir-
cumstances beyond my con-
trol, wish to inform you, which
is to promulgate the fact, that
my i n t e n t i o n s , as set out
below, following intense deli-
beration, and many sleepless
nights, are:
Due to unforseen circum-
stances at the time of the un-
foreseen circumstances afore-
mentioned above (and all that
c r a p ) , i n my o p i n i o n , the
higher echelons of the C & G
Executive have failed to main-
tain the active social image ol
Guilds Union, especially with
respect to mascotry, which has
been reduced to a farcical level
with the introducion of vari-
ous truces, etc., with all res-
p o n s i b i l i t y b e i n g r e m o v e d
from the esteemed position
which I have been proud to
hold, and entrusted to others.
Consequently, I hereby sub-
mit my resignation lo the post
of City and Guilds Union
Spanner Bearer.

Dear Sir
I feel that the U n i o n / C o l -
lege "us and them" relation-
s h i p has n o w d e v e l o p e d
between the students a n d
Michael Arthur of the Stu-
dents Services Office, who is
now a- College employee, as
opposed lo a Union employee.
Are we to assume from your
references to fairies in the last
two issues that you think
Michael Arthur is "one of
them".
} ours faithfully

Dear Sir
Re the ignominious bunch
of cock-suckers and hand-job
merchants that we in C h e m 2
have had imposed upon us.
We wish it to be known that
we totally dissociate ourselves
from the egotistical comments
and "in-jokes" which they
choose to impose upon the
readership of your learned
journal.
lours irately
D a n n y O ' H a r e , R. Jones,
D a v e A r m s t r o n g , R u s s e l l
Smith (Chem 2)
Dear Sir
I think that the suggestion
in the last issue o l ' F E L I X that
an "accident" should happen
to c e r t a i n m e m b e r s ol
Chemistry 2 is a scandal and
an outrage.
It is obvious that you are
t o t a l l y i n e x p e r i e n c e d in
dealing with such people.
Talking as a man experienced
in such matters, I can assure
you that any actions should be
entirely deliberate.
