"Why I believe RCS is going to
the dogs"
by S.J. Marshall, ARCS
T h e centenary year of the Royal College of Science seems an opportune time to ponder on the
d o w n w a r d trend in the reputation of this once reputable institution to such an extent that M r
Dave T h o m p s o n , R C S U n i o n President, finds it necessary to consume his own excrement in
the U n i o n Bar as a celebration of this achievement. M a y I offer some of my own personal
thoughts on the matter, writing as a proud Associate of the R C S who is losing that pride rapidly
on overviewing the recent actions of the R C S U n i o n , supposedly representative of the R C S as
a whole. 1 shall attempt to show that they are not representative and deserve no support but
only the contempt of those who are.
T h e t r o u b l e s e e m s to stem from the
unhealthy relationship between the higher
echelons of the R C S Union and those people
known collectively as the "22 Club". This club
is a "private" organisation which is intended
for people who have made a contribution to
the R C S Union in social and athletic spheres;
elected membership. At this stage I should
point out that I have absolutely no desire to be
disrespectful to older members of the 22 Club,
or indeed to some current student members; I
am sure that they would not condone the foul
acts of the few, in particular, M r D a v e
Thompson, who I believe, as R C S Union
President has acted outside the n o r m a l
decorum afforded to such a noble position
within the structure of the R C S .
The 22 Club is not above public comment
because it is a "private club"; its constitution
makes it an integral part of the R C S . It seeks
to elect "worthy" members of the R C S and in
so doing becomes representative of the R C S .
It is u n f o r t u n a t e that the o n l y t a n g i b l e
representations of the R o y a l College of
Science, which excels in academic excellence,
should be the R C S Union heirarchy and the 22
Club. Members of these organisations do not
excel academically because they are too busy
excelling at vomiting out of windows onto
passers-by and consuming faeces in public.
This is a recent trend; a pity it should have
reached such an unseemly climax in the year
of the College's centenary, in fact the very
week!
If I lacked knowledge of the glorious history
of the R C S and of its achievements in its one
hundred years of existence and had only the
R C S Union and 22 Club to look up to, I should
certainly not want to sustain any connection
upon graduation; membership of the R C S
A s s o c i a t i o n is d w i n d l i n g b e c a u s e it is
unfortunately t a r r e d by the same b r u s h .
Similarly, 1 could not feel proud to write the
letters A . R . C . S . after my name. Luckily, I
c a m e to the R C S w h e n the U n i o n h a d
leadership worthy of the college's reputation,
still socially orientated of course, but in an
a m i c a b l e w a y ; the u n i o n w a s u n i t e d .
Excesses, if indulged at all, were indulged in
private. I would be happy for M r Thompson to
consume bucketfuls of shit in the privacy of his
own sty, but not in public in the week of the
Centenary celebrations, the organisation of
which he had shown minimal interst. That is
out of order.
I believe this year's R C S fresher has been
actively discouraged from showing any interest
in the college's past history by these unceasing
discreditable acts, presumably intended to
impress, coupled with narrative from this years
R C S Union Officers, who are surely the most
slow-witted, shallow and uninspiring bunch of
morons to emerge into the limelight in my four
years' personal knowledge of the R C S .
I believe M r Thompson is a quite genuine
person who believes he is working towards a
great surge in the popularity of the R C S
Union. But he is labouring under the massive
misconception that his sole coprophagous
contribution to the Centenary celebrations was
a great thing. I feel freshers will not have
returned home this Christmas to tell their
parents: "Hey. R C S is a really great place, they
eat their own shit." Unfortunately, neither will
they have told their parents of the great men
who owe their greatness to the R C S , from T.
H. Huxley and H . G . Wells of yesteryear to the
nobel laureates of today. A n d this was simply
b e c a u s e they t o o k little i n t e r e s t in the
Centenary and unfortunately missed out o n a n
excellent opportunity to delve into history. It
was handed to them on a platter but M r
Thompson and his unsavoury friends had
already seen to it that their first impressions
were the wrong ones.
Encouragement for M r Thompson emanates
from the bowels of the 22 Club, an organisation
that has enough collective experience to know
better. The very thing that the club was set up in
1922 to safeguard, that is the preservation of
social wellbeing within the R C S (from a res-
pectable distance) is now being destroyed by
the mentally impoverished minority presently
being deemed "worthy" of membership.
In the same way as decent members of the 22
Club are degraded and tarnished by the acts of
the few, so too are A L L members of the R C S ,
those "not privileged" to be singled out as
official representatives, but who nevertheless
have the right to be proud of their college, and
its history.
Sense has not even permeated into the one
member of the R C S U n i o n team who might
have been thought to possess it, namely Dr
Chris Bruton, Life Sciences lecturer, Senior
Treasurer of the R C S Union (and member of
22 Club). W h e n I interviewed him on his
thoughts about the future of the R C S , with
particular reference to M r Dave Thompson, he
showed what a fine judge of character he was.
He said that M r Thompson was " a very nice
c h a p " . But perhaps D r B r u t o n was just
treading carefully, as he later admitted to'
thinking he was "as thick as two short planks".
In summation, what R C S students must
never forget is that to be anAssociate of the
R o y a l C o l l e g e of S c i e n c e ( A . R . C . S . ) is
something to be proud of. We must never
allow the rubbish people who strut around in
the name of the R C S to take that away from
us. In a nutshell, it simply means that the ones
who really are representative of the R C S must
not allow themselves to be conned by the
intellectually inept few who believe they are the
chosen race.
