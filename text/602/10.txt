Grants: Student grants are going down again
next year by an average of £5 per week, and if
you are unlucky enough to be one of the 75%
of students whose parents do not pay their full
contribution you will be even worse hit. It
r e m a i n s to be seen w h e t h e r o u r glorious
President will pick up his hot-line to Keith
Joseph and instruct the government to change
its policy. Anyone who doubts I C U ' s ability to
mount any sort of campaign against grant cuts
while isolated from the rest of the student
movement is invited to get in touch with the
Labour Club. W e will be supporting the N U S
campaign.
Coming Soon: O u r first major speaker this
term will be Neil Kinnock MP, opposition
spokesman on education, on February 2 in
ME220 at 1:00pm. A member of the Labour
Party's National Executive Committee, he has
been heavily criticised by the Bennite faction
for his crucial votes opposing the endorsement
of Peter Tatchell and supporting an enquiry
into the militant tendency. Neil Kinnock's
interest in higher education goes back to his
day as the student union president in Cardiff.
SF Soc
Brushing the little men from his trouser-legs
the bulletin author once again leaps into action
with a gleam in his eye, a song in his heart and
a moneky on his back. It is tempting to suggest
that the monkey in question is N . Willson, but
it ain't so, despite his derogatory references to
S F readers in his book review column last
week I will say no more, believing as I do that to
have Riddley Walker and completely missed
the point is punishment enough. O n e plus
point for M r Willson; as far as I know he is the
only book reviewer not to write his review in
the style of the book.
While we're on the subject of books, S F Soc
library meetings are still taking place o n
Thursday lunchtimes in the G r e e n Committee
Room. More book-buying will take place soon,
so if you want to influence the choices, turn up
at a library meeting. Chris Priest may be
coming for a chat soon. More details will be
forthcoming when there are more details.
Anyone who missed the Czechoslovakian
S F film Tomorrow I'll be Scalding Myself with
Tea m i s s e d a t r e a t . It w e n t o n f r o m a
somewhat heavy-handed beginning to become
the best time-travel film I've ever seen. If you
ever again get the chance to see it, do.
The column has once again run out of
space, but as Bonner the Stachastic once said
"that's life". Y o u r s until book reviewers give
S F its due.
Belnot Phist and the Green Committee
Just a quick word this week to announce the
R C S R a g M a g T r i p to C a m b r i d g e o n
Wednesday, January 27, meeting at Beit A r c h
at 12:00. There are many seats still available,
and the system operating is that seats on the
coach will cost £3 per person with cash back
depending on sales of Rag Mags. Thus you can
h a v e a c h e a p t r i p t o s e e a n y p a l s i n
Cambridge, a free trip by selling lots of Rag
Mags, or a combination of both. Refunds will
be of the order of £1 for 20 Rag Mags sold, and
considering the vast hordes of suckers, sorry
students, available, sales of 100 or more are
possible. Please give your names to your soc
reps as soon as possible if you want to go.

Amensi
International
Group
IC's Amnesty International G r o u p continues
to campaign for the implementation of the
U N ' s Universal Declaration of H u m a n Rights,
w h i c h has been signed by almost all the
m e m b e r states of the U N . T h e p r i n c i p a l
method remains the letter-writing campaign, in
which letters on behalf of a person imprisoned
for non-violent adherence to his beliefs arrive
simultaneously from thousands of Amnesty
m e m b e r s t h r o u g h o u t t h e w o r l d . M a n y
prisoners have testified that such a deluge of
letters has caused a marked improvement in
their treatment, and often their immediate
release.
The group's adopted prisoner is a student,
Firmin Awadon of Benin, who was arrested,
but not charged in 1979 after students had
formed their own 'Action G r o u p ' to oppose
the government-controlled body which until
then was their only representation. Enquiries
about his legal position are not answered by
his government. The group is looking into the
possibility of obtaining the help of firms which
trade in Benin.
B e f o r e a d o p t i n g a p r i s o n e r A m n e s t y
International conducts an investigation to
ascertain whether the person is imprisoned for
his beliefs a n d w h e t h e r he has used or
advocated violence. The IC group is helping
with such a preliminary investigation for a
prisoner in Sri Lanka.
Snooker
Both the handicap and open tournaments are
well under way now, and the deadline for first
round matches to be completed has been set
at January 29. If you haven't played yet, put a
notice up on one of the boards in the snooker
room (where the draws for each tournament
are) for your opponent listing the times you
can play. If matches haven't been completed
by the date, the winner will be decided by
chosing the person who has made most effort
to play the game. The B table will be set aside
for m a t c h play only o n T u e s d a y 26 a n d
Thursday 28 January, and you can now book
two hour slots (at any time) to play matches.
Best of luck to everyone, but watch out for
nosebleed specialist Jennings.
