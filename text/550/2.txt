Over Easter the intellectual giants of IC, Frank James, Damian Hassan,
Nick Griffin and Andrew Gray were unlucky to have to play against a team
in form on G R A N A D A ' s University Challenge. The score 140-390 to
Queens College Cambridge reflects the problems IC faced in having to
answer the obscure questions compiled by G R A N A D A television

FELIX EDITOR L O C K E D
IN T H E T O W E R
O n Monday, Colin Palmer, climbed the Queens Tower.
His aim was to photograph the bell ringers but due to a
misunderstanding they left and locked him in the tower. It is
difficult to climb the spiral staircases in the dark but Colin
had to reach the upper balcony to call for help. The Editor
was worried that he would be imprisoned until the Rag Fete
on May 3rd when visitors pay to climb it. After an hour of
shouting and waving his shirt a secretary from Sherfield
phoned security believing Colin was going to jump. The
above photo shows the Editor's rescuers, Sid, Mick and Clilf
unlocking the gates. Views from the Queens Tower are
published in this weeks FELIX on pages 6 and 7.
