Easter N U S Conference Report
by IC's Unofficial Observer
Many abbreviations have been used in this
article, so to clarify:
LA = Left Alliance (nee Broad Left).
C o m p r i s e d of some N O L S , some
Liberals and the C P . The ruling group in
NUS. Based on individual membership.
C P = O f f i c i a l C o m m u n i s t P a r t y .
"Tankies".
N O L S = National Organisation of
Labour Students; many not in L A .
ULS [ Union of Liberal Students; some
LA, some not.
F C S = Federation of Conservative
Students (those involved in student
unions tend to be "pinkos").
SSA [ Socialist Students' Alliance (once
IMG).
SWSO = Socialist Workers' Students
Organisation; even more left-wing
Trotskyite group than SSA.
Elections
President: Dave Aaronovitch (LA/CP)
Secretary: Fiona MacTaggart (LA)
Treasurer: Helen Connors (LA)
Vice Pres Welfare: Leighton Andrews
(LA/ULS)
Vice Pres Education: Andy Pearmain
(LA/CP).
All the above sabbatical.
Exec Officers: C h r i s H a m e l - S m i t h
(Independent); Jane Taylor (LA); Hank
Hastings (SSA).
Exec Members: Chris Bones (FCS);
M a r k Cassidy ( N O L S ) ; J a n Nielsen
(SWSO); Steve Reicher (SSA).
Exec Committee Members: Linda
Miller (LA); Ann Henderson (SSA); Mark
Wooding (FCS); Paul Rees (SWSO); Alan
Watson (NOLS).
Two interesting points about the elections:
1. Having ensured the election of a Liberal
sabbatical on the L A slate, many U L S
members then voted for non-LA candi-
dates; Chris Hamel-Smith (an amazingly
funny speaker who stood as a joke
candidate for President both last year and
this) and Bob Greig, who narrowly failed
to be elected as an Exec member.
2. The ever-growing move by N O L S away
from the L A ; two of their dissident
candidates were elected, both at the
expmftiye of L A candidates.
The significance of the above points is
that the Broad Left/Left Alliance clique
that has controlled N U S Exec for years is
no longer in a majority. It's not that
F C S / N O L S / T r o t coalitions are likely, but
it's refreshing to see a broader spread of
opinion.
Motions
1. Subscriptions. In my report of the
Christmas conference I noted the urgent
need for a subs policy; the Exec had to
compromise with either F C S or the two
trot groups. The policy passed was a
compromise with the Tories, which eases
the burden placed on the larger colleges
(like IC if we were in).
2. Priorities. Narrowly, and after very
lengthy debate the National Union voted
to begin to lose its 'rentamob' (to quote
the Mail and Telegraph) image, and to
concentrate more on student related
activities. This also signals the demise of
much of NUS's international work. In my
opinion this is but a step in the right
direction. Had some contraction not been
accepted however, N U S may well have
gone bankrupt.
3. Afghanistan, World Peace, Etc. The
Liberal line was 'boycott'; the Tory line
was 'at the athletes' discretion', but the
policy passed was the CP's 'peace and
disarmament idea.
4. Nuclear Power. All the debate was
about which anti-Nuke stance N U S
should take (the guardedly pro-Nuke F C S
Not having an amendment in). The best
speech however was Trevor (ex-IC)
Phillips closing speech against the main
motion. He didn't quite swing the vote
through.
5. Grants. Here the main motion was an
Exec/ULU composite. The U L U part was
based on a London Grants paper drawn
up by Bernard Smith, which was rejected
here, but was passed overwhelmingly at
U L U .
6. Northern Ireland. On the last day of
conference (when many delegates had
left) the two Trot groups, passed policy in
favour of the 'Troops Out' line; something
of a change from the established 'peace
and jobs' policy.
