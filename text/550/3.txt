Building Bricks
Four students were found trying to
build a brick wall across Beit Arch on
Tuesday morning. The wall was being
built so that people wanting to enter
the Quad could be charged admission,
the proceeds being donated to Rag.
The attempt was foiled by College
security at 7:30am and the bricks later
removed by College.

A C C V a n In A c c i d e n t
With Barn
The van belonging to the Athletic
Clubs Committee has been exten-
sively damaged following an ac-
cident. Members of Orienteering
Club were in the Lake District in the
van when it was driven into a barn.
Although the full extent of the
damage is as yet unknown, it is feared
that the van could be a write off.
New Heating System
Work has started over the vacation on
the upgrading of the heating system in
Southside. The work taking place at
present involves the removal of the
original installation in K e o g h and
Selkirk Halls, excluding the one floor of
Selkirk that has been previously fitted
with the new heating system as' an
experiment. The replacement work
includes improving the insulation
under the windows in the rooms,
altering the system from a one pipe
system to a two pipe system, in order
that the rooms will be heated more
evenly. The old convector heaters
have been removed and are being
replaced by thermostatically con-
trolled radiators. New meters are also
to be installed to measure the amount
of heat used. It is hoped that the work
will be completed by the start of the
next heating season.

transport is fifteen hundred pounds
in the red and has ten thousand
pounds worth of vans on order.
