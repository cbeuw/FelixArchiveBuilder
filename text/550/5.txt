'Welcome, my friends, to the S h o w that
never ends!'
A new term starts and everyone returns,
resolve has once again been hardened.
B u t of c o u r s e t h i s t e r m is d i f f e r e n t ,
different for you and, of course, for me.
S o . . . .
W e l c o m e to y o u r E x a m t e r m a n d m y
Valedictory term-
W a i t , b e f o r e y o u s i n k i n t o a p i l e of
revisions, just remember that the U n i o n
won't go d o w n without a fight, or at least
a fete ( 3 r d M a y ) , a n d a n A G M (20th
May). A n d other bits and pieces.
A s y o u m a y r e m e m b e r , w e h a d a n
a c c o m m o d a t i o n s u r v e y , the r e s u l t s of
w h i c h will be p u b l i s h e d l a t e r . A t the
College-organised seminar on accommoda-
tion many topics were broached but there
were very few conclusions (ie, none).
O n e idea was that of a 'satellite' community,
big enough to c o m m a n d its o w n social
life, s i t e d w i t h i n easy a c c e s s but i n a
cheaper area, this is as well as using the
West and N o r t h Kensington areas (which
are r e l a t i v e l y c h e a p e r ) . S h a r e d t r i p l e s
c o m e out very low on the top 20 pops
and rent levels will probably reflect this
next year.
G U I L D S
OLD CENTRAL!ANS' AWARDS
A M Holbein Memorial Award
The O l d Centralians will once again be
making this award to the Guildsperson
who best fits the following three criteria:
i) S o m e o n e who has proved them-
selves as an enthusiastic and able
sportsman for Guilds (rather than
IC or U L ) .
ii) Socially enthusiastic and well-liked.
iii) A n a c t i v e U n i o n m e m b e r (but
preferably not on the Exec).
Each nomination should be supported by
a written recommendation of about two
h u n d r e d w o r d s a n d s h o u l d r e a c h J o
Armitage, C & G President, by 2nd M a y .
Further details are available from the Guilds
Union Office. All nominations will be treated
in the strictest confidence.
Holbein Travel Scholarship 1980
The O l d Centralians Trust will award a
travel scholarship to a value of £100 to
enable undergraduates of the City and
Guilds College to undertake a study project
abroad during the summer vacation of 1980.
A c o p y of the conditions of award can be
obtained from the Guilds U n i o n Office. A l l
applications must be summitted not later
than 16th M a y .
O n the subject of rents, discussion on
next year's rent levels opened last week
in the Residence Finance Sub-committee.
T h i s h a s p r o p o s e d a f a i r l y m a s s i v e
increase in Hall and H o u s e rents to the
main committee. I have proposed another
set of rises which, though smaller, is still
by economic necessity (ie, the account
has to break even), fairly large. T h e jump
is made larger by the fact that the mid-
session rise was averted, (ie, though a
deficit budget was avoided the account
really r a n at a l o s s ) . A l s o , the E v e l y n
G a r d e n s l e a s e p u r c h a s e r e p a y m e n t s
account for an enormous figure. Finally,
the weightings have been changed so that
the less salubrious rooms (triples, etc)
have m u c h lower percentage increases.
I will keep you informed as the discussions
progress and will be more specific next
week.
A s to the W U S / I C T h i r d W o r l d Scholar-
ship the student side has raised £1,200.
Special congratulations must go to F i o n a
Sinclair, J o h n Whitehouse and the other
b a d g e - s e l l e r s . T h e I n d i a n E m b a s s y
responded with a £50 cheque to the letter
I s e n t t o e v e r y e m b a s s y , b u t o n l y a
disappointing £400 has c o m e f r o m the
staff. They will shortly be given another
opportunity to contribute!
W h a t did I do while I was using up some
of my four weeks holiday? O h , I went to
Ireland, I went sailing, and I went into the
Christmas tree business.
A lot of third years and final year P G s will
be 'enjoying' job interviews, etc. S o m e will
have already sorted out their future. I
wish the former all the luck in the world
and congratulate/commiserate (delete as.
appropriate) the latter.
I a m available as a consultant (contract
negotiable) for any chemists with academic
problems (preliminary advice is ' G o to the
R C S A n n u a l Dinner and the Rag Ceilidh,',
thereby forgetting the problems).
There, and I didn't mention exams m u c h at
all, did I?
Y o u r s aye,
C F F o x , B S c (Hons), A R C S
P S : I passed — so can you!
P P S : I'm slimming.

S o , back to the academic grindstone we
go, pausing only to read Broadsheet on a
Thursday morning and look forward to a
very limited programme of events geared
to fit e x a c t l y i n t o e v e r y o n e ' s r e v i s i o n
programme.
Firstly, the A n n u a l Dinner on M a y 2nd
p r o v i d e s a f o u r - c o u r s e m e a l w i t h t h e
usual trimmings, plenty of sherry, wine,
port and beer with a bar extension and
disco. F a r more enjoyable than Freshers'
D i n n e r s w i t h a b o u t t w o h u n d r e d a n d
seventy to three hundre d people usually
attending. Tickets are fairly expensive at
£7 each, but we'd like to get over three
h u n d r e d p e o p l e t h e r e a n d m a k e it
memorable.
M a y 3 r d s e e s t h e I C R a g F e t e i n
Princes Gardens. R C S will be running the
Q u e e n s T o w e r and also giving rides o n
Jez, so if y o u can spare an hour helping
with either of these see M o M i s r a .
O n M a y 4 J e z is driving to Brighton in
t h e H i s t o r i c C o m m e r c i a l V e h i c l e s R u n
and a coach has been organised to take
s u p p o r t e r s ( s w i m m e r s , sightseers, s u n
bathers, etc) d o w n to Brighton for the
day. There will be a nominal c o a c h fare,
but if you're interested leave your name
in the R C S U (or ring 4276).
A n y w a y , h a v i n g w h e t y o u r a p p e t i t e
we'll keep y o u informed of other events.
