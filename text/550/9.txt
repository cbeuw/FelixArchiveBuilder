STUDENT COUNSELLOR
I suppose anybody wearing the label 'Counsellor' round his neck
must expect to evoke some fairly odd reactions, both among
students and among staff. F o r example: " Y o u deal with money
and digs and things, do you?", or "I didn't know there was one,"
or — more ominously — " D o e s anybody come to see you?"
I understand very well this is so, and have never doubted that
the onus for undermining the distorted perceptions that people
may have about my job is squarely in my court. This isn't just a
theoretical consideration — it matters a lot in practical terms,
because to the extent that such distortions are accepted, they
systematically exclude students (and staff) from help they should
be getting, and me from work I should be doing. I a m assured, by
people I respect, that what's needed is more publicity, and they
may be right, though it's not quite as simple as it sounds. There
would be no better way of arousing hostility and resentment than
plastering the college with the patronising message, A : that you
probably need help, and B : that I'm the chap to give it.
Things may be different elsewhere, but I've always believed that
a low profile approach is likely to prove more effective in the long
run at I C , and only a rather guilty awareness that this happens to
coincide with m y o w n inclinations and capacities prevents me
from putting the point m o r e assertively. I daresay there are
others, but the principal misconceptions about my particular job
quite c o m m o n l y held by staff and students alike, are as follows:
1. The counsellor's office is in
the Health C e n t r e , so there is
an easy associative link with
s i c k n e s s , p a t h o l o g y — e v e n
m a d n e s s . T h e c o u n s e l l o r is
perceived as a low level psychi-
atrist, a n d it follows, therefore,
that it is not appropriate to go
to see h i m u n l e s s o n e is in
extremis, and it is not appro-
priate to refer a student to him
except in these circumstances.
This, view is sometimes mani-
fested in remarks like, "I don't
t h i n k it's s e r i o u s e n o u g h to
send him to you . . . " This is
not the place to examine the
roots of such attitudes, which
have an apparently tenacious
h o l d d e s p i t e s u s t a i n e d a n d
l o n g - t e r m efforts to c o m b a t
them, but they are, I believe,
often linked in some way with a
.wish to deny the salience of
feeling in our lives — a mech-
anistic view of human behaviour
unfortunate when they operate
to preclude access to college
support systems.
If the a c t u a l siting of the
c o u n s e l l o r ' s office has s u c h
s i g n i f i c e n c e , w h y n o t j u s t
change it? Indeed, some student
counsellors would hold that the
disadvantages of close associa-
tion with doctors outweigh the
a d v a n t a g e s — t h o u g h m a n y
others, a n d so far, I've been
among them — tend to take
the o t h e r v i e w . P r o f e s s i o n a l
counsellors certainly need the
assured collaboration of doctors
for the straightforward reason
t h a t t h e s o r t of d i f f i c u l t i e s
which students properly bring
to a c o u n s e l l o r , s o m e t i m e s
have connotations (for example,
depression and anxiety) which
who have, by definition, done
well academically hitherto. S o far
as u n d e r g r a d u a t e s a r e c o n -
cerned, I have no reason to think
that I meet anything other than
an academically normal cross-
section of the population, both in
terms of their potential (ie, A
level results), or in terms of
eventual performance on their
degree courses. M o s t of the
students who c o m e to see me are
trying to cope with problems
which are only indirectly related
to work, and which would give
rise to difficulties for the most
stable and academically com-
petent among us. O f course, in
such circumstances, we may well
be able to talk to other sympath-
etic people — tutors, super-
visors, relatives, friends, and that
may be all that is needed. The
counsellor has a useful role to
play where, for one reason or
another, this informal network of
support is either not available or
not sufficient.
3. The counsellor is part of the
establishment — he keeps
r e c o r d s , a n d y o u n e e d a n
appointment to see him.

are medical, and where it is
clearly in everyone's interests
that a student should be checked
out by a sympathetic doctor,
frequently while maintaining his
primary link with the counsellor.
It is also quite c o m m o n for the
doctors to ask a student to see
me if they feel that the problems
could best be discussed with a
non-medical person. This kind of
flexible use of resources is more
likely to occur, and is easier to
set up, if people work in the same
building.
2. Students who go to see a
counsellor, are either academ-
ically or personally inadequate,
or both, and the counsellor's job,
in essence, is to prop up the
world's whiners.
A s it happens, each year I see a
d i s p r o p o r t i o n a t e n u m b e r of
post-graduate students, all of
The formality of a professional
c o u n s e l l i n g s e r v i c e is a bit
irksome to some people, and I
have no doubt that students
sometimes turn to other sources
of support (eg, Nightline) for that
sort of reason. Also, for some
people of student age, the notion
of relati ng to a middle-aged,
middle-class m a n , who wears
collar and tie, is unacceptable —
q u i t e s i m p l y b e c a u s e he is
identified in the student's mind
with values and beliefs which he
perceives in his parents. I do
keep records, they are a pre-
requisite in a professional setting
— but they are for my use only,
and I a m scrupulously careful
about their security. I also run an
appointments system, but so far
as I know, there has not been a
single occasion in six or seven
y e a r s w h e n a s t u d e n t w h o
w i s h e d t o s e e m e o n a n y
particular day has been unable to
do so. Indeed, many people do
call on me without an appoint-
ment, and providing I a m free, I
am entirely happy to talk to them
then and there.
4. Do-gooders are by nature
intrusive. G i v e n half a chance,
they batten on to you and make
you feel quilty if you try to back -
off. They can't wait to slap some
pseudo-scientific label on you.
Suspicion of the motives of
p e o p l e w h o set u p s h o p as
p r o f e s s i o n a l h e l p e r s is fair
enough. I suppose if I try to be
honest about motives for doing
this sort of work, they would
include the general requirment of
earning a living; the prestige of
working at Imperial; the security
o f e m p l o y m e n t ( r e l a t i v e l y
speaking) in the public service;
the occasional reward of know-
ing that one has done something
of value; and a vague awareness
that it's what I'm best at. They
would not include an impulse to
manipulate or exercise power
over people, indeed, since I'm
i m m e n s e l y s e n s i t i v e to m a n -
ipulation myself, I systemically
err on the side of caution.
However, having said that, it
remains true that counselling is
rooted in a relationship, albeit a
professional one, and involves a
degree of open-ness, trust and
c o m m i t m e n t . T h e c o u n s e l l o r
c a r r i e s the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for
setting the scene, as it were; but
the final r e s p o n s i b i l i t y is a
reciprocal one, and as in any
o t h e r s o r t of r e l a t i o n s h i p ,
nothing fruitful is likely to spring
f r o m it if one of the p a r t i e s
remains entrenched behind his
defences.
Essentially, I think I'm running
a casualty service for students
for w h o m t h i n g s h a v e g o n e
wrong, at least temporarily, and
who have c o m e to the point
where they feel there is merit in
talking to someone on w h o m
they have a mandatory right to
m a k e d e m a n d s , a n d i n the
k n o w l e d g e that w h a t is dis-
cussed is confidential, and will
have no repercussions beyond
the walls of my office, unless the
student chooses to initiate them.
A n d when things do go wrong
for a student, that tends to be
serious, not because students
have more, or worse, problems
than other people, but because
of the peculiar nature of their
occupation, ie, structured and
sustained learning. The high level
of i n t e l l e c t u a l e f f i c i e n c y de-
manded of a student is impaired
by a n x i e t y a n d d i s t r e s s —
whatever its origin, and gives a
certain urgency to the need for
intervention, for breaking into
the disastrous cycle at an early
stage.
Y o u will find details of my
whereabouts on posters around
the college, and in the internal
telephone directory. M y internal
phone number is 4205.
