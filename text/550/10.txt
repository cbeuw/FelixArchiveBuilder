April Fool
Those of you, in College on 1st April
might wish to know why College Block
were displaying massive orange letters in
their windows. It had much to do with
the following IC Admin memo concerning
L o n d o n F l o o d Warning that certain
individuals received.
L O N D O N F L O O D WARNING
The College has just been informed that a
critical period may o c c u r in the next two

agreed that various rooms in College will be
used as reception areas in the event of the
flood warning alert being activated.
T o facilitate ease of organisation each room
concerned has been designated a letter of the
alphabet, as follows:
Letter: Room No: Department:
T h e enclosed letter, (coloured side facing
outwards), should be attached to the top left-
h a n d c o r n e r of the furthest window IM-
M E D I A T E L Y on receipt of this notice.
Unfortunately, whilst many fell for it
(including the Rector's Office), some did
not, and the letters could not be seen to
read 'Ever been had — I C U 1st Apr.'
We did receive the following memo
from 'two individuals in College Block'.
L O N D O N F L O O D WARNING
T h a n k s to your timely warning the Rector
made plans for several drainage sump-holes to
be sunk in Imperial College R o a d and all
danger of flood water reaching above welly
level has been averted.
However, if these holes prove to be insufficient, all
staff at Imperial College (Sherfield) have been
instructed to evacuate premises and take u p
temporary refuge in your sherry cabinet.
In the tradition of women and children first,
C o l i n P a l m e r will be left to his d e v i c e s .
Photographs of his plight will be on sale at a
later date.
Rumours of the Rector having an inflatable life-
raft and boat-hook on his balcony are denied.
(Anyone remember the petit-fours).
Captain Lindley refuses to comment but has
been seen on the roof at sunset in full-dress
uniform.
More next week!

Bookshop
As from Monday, a limited supply of second
hand (in very good condition) lever arch files
will be on sale for 20p each and 100 sheets of
A4 narrow ruled paper for 30p. Also, as
usual, 10% off all Parker products.
Noise
It's exams term again (you lucky people!),
so I expect everyone using the Union
Building to give some consideration to
people living in Beit, ie — NO NOISE
LATE AT NIGHT!
This applies especially to J a z z Club,
whom I've received a lot of complaints
about recently. Unless people using the
Jazz Room are more sensible in the near
future, we may have to consider stopping
people using this room for music practice.
Incidentally, the bucket of water on my
balcony above Beit Arch is now nicely
green and stagnant — so, don't wake me
up, or else!
ICU Transport
ICU has three crewbuses, a van and two
landrovers available for hire to anyone at
IC at £9 a day and 6p per mile, further
details from Annie in the Union Office.
LST
See our America 1980 programme in this
issue of FELIX! Our fultsummer programme
should be published in early May.
