VICTORIOUS
Yet another sports event has been won by the
Royal School of Mines. On Wednesday thirty
students from Mines Guilds and R C S took part in
track and field events.
The event was covered for FELIX by Alan Murray
and his report is printed on the back page.
UGM
27 candidates stood for the six posts on the
Permanent Working Party of ICU. Their speeches
were limited to one minute and most candidates
used various topics on which to base their
campaigns.
Barney M c C a b e helped candidates who had not turned
up by drawing cartoon sketches of the candidates faces on
the M e c h E n g 220 B l a c k b o a r d . While the serious
candidates tried to cope with the atmosphere at the
meeting, others gave comic speeches which included
comments about the width of the beds in Southside, the
quality of food at IC and one student simply discussed
D r a g Racing.
The count will take place today. A l s o at the U G M M a r k

M a l c o l m Brain has said that due to popular demand he had
a hot drinks vending machine installed in the Lower
Lounge last term. " C h e a p e r and better than Mooney's,
but still very few people are using it!". Unless demand
increases he said that the machine will have to be taken
out.
