Young people are not always sold
the right life policies and sometimes
they are sold policies which they
do not need. This warning comes
from National Westminster Insur-
ance Services, the insurance
broking arm of the National
Westminster Bank, one of the
largest life assurance brokerages
in the country.
A s p o k e s m a n e x p l a i n e d t h a t , while
protection type cover is very cheap for
young people, few actually need a large
c a p i t a l s u m p a y a b l e o n their d e a t h as
t h e y h a v e n o d e p e n d a n t s . S o far as
savings type policies were concerned, it
was admittedly an attractive proposition
to take out a plan at a young age with tax
relief and look forward to a useful tax-free
lump sum in the late twenties or early
thirties when a decent car or other major
i n v e s t m e n t s m i g h t be c o n t e m p l a t e d .
H o w e v e r , in m a n y c a s e s a s t u d e n t ' s
resources are stretched and long term
savings through life assurance is just not
a top priority.
Incidentally, if the main aim is future
house p u r c h a s e , N a t i o n a l W e s t m i n s t e r
would normally suggest a regular savings
p l a n w i t h a b u i l d i n g s o c i e t y , p o s s i b l y
accompanied by an inexpensive flexible
life policy.
Unit linked plans do not usually provide
s u c h a h i g h l e v e l of g u a r a n t e e s a s
traditional with profits contracts and are
only normally recommended by the B a n k
in combination with other contracts for
people who have reasonable resources or
where the accumulation period is long
and the customer really does appreciate
the nature of the contract.
If the idea of taking a slightly higher
risk in exchange for a possibly (but not
certainly) better result has appeal (and
not all advisers would agree that this is
the right type of contract for the first
t i m e i n v e s t o r ) m a k e c e r t a i n y o u a r e
dealing with a well established company
with evidence of management expertise
and a track record.
N o n profit type savings contracts and
s o m e s a v i n g s c o n t r a c t s w h i c h p r o v i d e
numerous options most of which o n close
inspection are unlikely to be used (but will
be p a i d for!) a l s o t e n d to be e i t h e r
u n s u i t a b l e for y o u n g p e o p l e o r p o o r
value.
Whilst flexibility to vary the type of
benefits in line with changing circumstances
is v e r y u s e f u l a n d c a n be i m p o r t a n t ,
especially if you have an idea of how youi
circumstances will change (for example,
f i r m i n t e n t i o n to get m a r r i e d o r the
probability that you will need to support
ageing parents) be wary of buying multi
purpose plans for premiums which seem
high in relation to your resources as you
are likely to wind up with a package of
compromises none of which will offer top
value.
Life c o v e r c a n , says N a t i o n a l W e s t
m i n s t e r I n s u r a n c e S e r v i c e s , be a t a x
efficient and profitable savings medium
and it can also provide substantial tax
free funds on death. B u t , as a student
likely to be earning well above average in
the years to c o m e you should recognise
that you are fair game for the aggressive
s a l e s m a n . T h e r e f o r e , get g o o d a d v i c e
f r o m a w e l l e s t a b l i s h e d s p e c i a l i s t life
broker who enjoys a good reputation. A
s a l e s m a n s e l l i n g o n l y o n e c o m p a n y ' s
p r o d u c t s has o n l y a l i m i t e d r a n g e of
contracts to offer you and while some
may be good it would be a bold company
salesman who could claim that his office
o f f e r e d t o p v a l u e for e v e r y t y p e of
contract available.
If you do not k n o w a good broker your
local National Westminster B a n k Manager
will be pleased to arrange professional
advice for you but remember:
1. If you cannot afford Â£5 a month before
tax relief for a savings type plan your
priorities probably lie elsewhere. However,
less than this amount could buy you a policy
which provides lots of cover payable on
death only and a guarantee of future
insurability which you may consider to be a
low price to pay for peace of mind.
2. If you are approached, or decide to seek
advice, have a clear idea of what you want
from your plan - if you have only a hazy idea
you should probably wait until you are
working or just before you start and think
seriously about the whole business then.
