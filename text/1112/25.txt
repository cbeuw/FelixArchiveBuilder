JAMES
Best of...
EVERCLEAR
So Much for the
E
veryone knows at least one
song by James. They formed
in the mid-eighties and
bucked the whole idea of synth-
pop and the m u c h - h y p e d ' N e w
Wave' that was appearing in the
music scene back then and instead
created songs that mirrored the
guitar pop of bands like the Smiths.
They hail from manchester and
were at their height in the baggy
'Madchester' scene at the turn of
the decade along with bands like
the Stone Roses, the H a p p y
M o n d a y s and M y Bloody Valentine.
In 1990, you couldn't go anywhere
without seeing a James flower
scribbled somewhere. Whether it
was on a wall, a poster, a magazine
or on a schoolbook, it m a d e certain
that the band's name w a s well-
known. This was partially due to the
re-release of the excellent single Sit
Down around then w h i c h c a m e
shortly after what many still claim is
their best album. Cold Mother was
almost a masterpiece. It s e e m e d to
talk in the language of its fans and
its songs were d a m n catchy. The
band released Seven and Laid in
the early '90s but it was their last
album Whiplash that s e e m e d to
bring t h e m most s u c c e s s . This
album contained songs that were
very indicative of their earlier
efforts but brought them up to
date. The g o o d thing about releas-
ing a compilation of their best
songs, then, is that it unites all the
different sets of fans that James
have. There are those w h o were
around in '84, those w h o jumped
onto the bandwagon in '89, those
who 'discovered' them w h e n it
looked like they wouldn't be releas-
ing anything else earlier this decade
and, of course, those w h o thought
that Whiplash w a s James' first
album.
James: The Best Of contains a
list of the band's history, as you
would imagine. It's not chronologi-
cal, though; expect to hear things
like the recent She's a Star and
Waltzing Along nestled up along-
side classics like Come Home and
How was it for You. It might be a
strange way to package a compila-
tion, but it works. It really is possi-
ble to see that the essential ingredi-
ent that makes the songs so g o o d
is present and correct in all of the
tracks in the same way. Part of that
'something' is singer Tim Booth's
voice which was amongst one of
the strongest and most distinctive
around when the band started up
and this is still the case today.
If you are an old fan of James
and you saw them through baggy
back in '89, then you'll already have
all of the songs that are on here and
you w o n ' t need me to tell you to go
out and get it. This album is clearly
aimed at those generation of fans
who bought the last album and
want to get into the older stuff. Or
those w h o have heard Sit Down
and decided that they rather liked
it. Well, if this is y o u , then d o get
the album, you won't be disap-
pointed. If y o u don't fit into any of
the above categories but y o u have
an open mind and want to experi-
ence a brief history of one of the
best bands to emerge from England
in the last fifteen years, then give it
a listen. You'll love it. E3 Alok
Afterglow
West Coast based guitar, bass and
drums trios will always be c o m -
pared to Nirvana. Unfortunately
this means that they always c o m e
across as watered d o w n .
You can't deny that the energy
and spirit are still present, as well
as the sombre storytelling style
with Everclear. C h e c k out the
bonus track, Hating You for
Christmas, which tells a tale of
being d u m p e d at Christmas time.
Jolly stuff, eh? What seems to be
playing truant is the raw emotional
spark. For something that's sup-
posed to be punky and aggression-
fuelled, you feel like they got bored
and rattled this song off during
their sleep.
However, there are revealing
high points, in that they are the
instrumentals. Media Intro is sam-
pled from a 60's movie about anti-
depressants but it's El Distorto De
Melodica which is the g e m . It's a
cacophony of overamped guitars
and screaming voices and is a
cross between Primal Scream and
The Sex Pistols. The problem is that
these tracks are the o d d ones out.
M a y b e next time Everclear will
churn out an interesting alternative
record with w e i r d noises a n d
haunting harmonies. However, I
feel they might be too far d o w n the
punk grunge trio line to extricate
themselves fully. Dennis
LIOIMROCK
City Delirious * * * *
City Delirious is Lionrock's second
album and it's nothing short of
superb. There's a mix of instrumen-
tals and lyrical tunes, but it's the
overall production of the music
that really allows the music to gel.
W e ' r e treated with a mix of
rhythms and beats, with live guitars
and off key basslines, forever loop-
ing in on each other.
The first single to be released
from this album is the triumphant
Rude Boy Rock. With a p u m p i n g
bassline and a catchy brass section
lead, Lionrock have placed their
proverbial paw well in the court of
pop. O n e would assume that any
dreams of p o p stardom rely heavi-
ly on this being accepted by the
mass populous, and from the satu-
ration radio play it has achieved
this seems inevitable.
Live drums and guitars, p
key part in the brilliantly TS
Electric Hairdo, as the diversity of
the instruments used seems to
increase with every track. A prob-
lem often encountered w h e n faced
with such a mind blowing array of
instruments is what to actually
keep your ears tuned to, but as
Lionrock keep things simple with
perfect p o p structure there is no
such problem.
The title track, City Delirious,
brings us vocals in the form of the
semi-rap, semi-singing style of the
Stereo M C ' s in such a catchy way
that allows us to forgive them any
lack of lyricism that may exist.
Indeed the voice adds such quality
to the sound, it wouldn't matter in
the lyrics were in Esperanto.
Overall, a wonderful album that
keeps your foot t a p p i n g from
beginning to end.
