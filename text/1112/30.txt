C L U B S C E N E - C L U B R E V I E W .
% ULTIMATE B.A.S.E.
@ The Velvet Rooms, WC1.
I
have been meaning to attend
this club for a very long time ,
especially since it's refurbish-
ment late last year. For those of y o u
who for some reason have not
heard of this almost legendary club
night, it is on every Thursday 9 p m -
3am and the occasional Saturday
down The End nightclub.
It also has every thing "to do
with the big man Carl Cox w h o is
resident along with Jim Masters.
Either one or the other is always
there. Unluckily for me w e attended
a night when Jim not Carl was in the
C L U B S C E N E - C O M P I L A T I O N S
place. I have nothing against Jim
y o u understand but Carl Cox has
been my hero for many years now
and I would have loved to have
seen him in action again.
W e arrived around midnight
and entered probably the most
plush surroundings in London- the
Velvet Rooms and I can now see
why it's so-called, with the walls
covered with red cushions and pris-
tine red seats it just oozes class.
This is only a small club but it has
plenty of seating and a crystal clear
sound system making this the per-
The House Music Movement
Mixed By DOC MARTIN (MASTER TONE) • • • 1 / 2
T
his is the first from a new
series The Complete History
of House mixed and is pre-
sented by the worlds greatest DJs.
Lining up alongside LA finest (Doc
Martin) in this series are T o d d Terry
and Roger Sanchez (New York),
Farley Jackmaster Funk (Chicago)
and Murk (Miami).
Accompanying each of these
mix CDs is an interview C D featur-
ing some of the originators of the
house movement talking with Jon
Fleming about the history of house.
The man behind this first offer-
ing is Doc Martin. I'm pretty sure
most of y o u won't be familiar with
the name, which is surprising as he
is one of the major players on the
world scene. So here are a few
things you should know about him:
1. Has played for 28 days straight.
2. Has over 1,300,000 airmiles.
3. Only West-Coast DJ to have
lived in NY.
4. Has played with Dee-lite, The
Prodigy, M o d y etc.
5. Voted in top 20 DJs in the world
by details magazine.
6. Can hold a floor for up to 8hrs.
So he has the credentials -
what about the C D . As y o u would
expect the mixing is smoother than
a babies bottom and the tunes are
taken from the early days of house
music. The set builds and progress-
es nicely. I remember what some-
one once said to me, "your set
should be like your telling a story"
and this is a g o o d example of it.
The musical styles covered are
deep house with occasional vocals,
getting harder towards the end.
So all in all this is a very c o m -
petent mix C D nicely packaged
with plenty of background info on
the scene. A n d you won't find any
chart toppers on here as is so often
the case, but only the real music
behind this musical revolution. JP
feet place to sit back in the most
pleasant surroundings your likely to
find in a club anywhere and listen to
up-front music.
In case your were wondering,
the music policy is hard house /
techno &. tech-house brought to
you by the best in the business.
W h e n we arrived the place wasn't
packed but an ample amount of
people were there and the music
wasn't to hard at all, but gradually
building as the night progressed
until about 1.00 w h e n the DJ
unleashed a fierce assault of tech-
no. Just what the crowd had been
waiting for -first class stuff.
This club does not only boast
the best techno music you'll find
anywhere in L o n d o n especially on a
Thursday but a club that has the
nicest little touches such as air con-
ditioning (no sweaty monsters in
here) and people that c o m e round
and collect e m p t y bottles and
empty the ash trays so your not
falling over bottles all night.
So full marks to club and pro-
moters. A night that will takes a lot
of beating. JP
The Sound Of The Underground
Mixed By The Lisa Marie Experience * * • 1/2
T
his is the sister series being
run in conjunction with The
House Music Movement.
This one showcases the leading
names from around the world with
mixes to c o m e from Norty Cotto's
NY latino, DJ Alfredo's balearic
beats, DJ M a r q u e s Wyatt (LA) and
Psycho Bitch &. Teri Bristol
(Chicago), covering the under-
ground that is 90's club culture.
Neil Hinde and Dean Marriott
aka The Lisa Marie Experience get
the series underway with their o w n
blend of up-front club cuts that
have helped make London one of
the most forward looking club cul-
tures in the world. The musical
style is underground disco/ house
but not quite as underground as I
was expecting or hoping.
The Lisa Marie Experience take
there name from Jacko's ex-wife
Lisa Marie Presley (but don't ask
me why). They have had wide
spread success over the past few
years, not only with their remix
work but also with their o w n pro-
ductions.
The peak of there success was
the club anthem of 96' Keep on
Jumpin' which also reached N o . 30
in the national charts.
In case y o u where wondering
the mixing is of a high standard, no
lame uninvolved stuff here but long
running tight mixes.
The mix is set rolling with a true
house classic House is a Feeling-
by Sunday School and this is a
g o o d indication of the overall style
- not the most underground selec-
tion I can think of but not a bad
one either. Again this all comes
very neatly packaged with plenty of
info on the boys.
All-in-all this isn't a bad start to
what could be a comprehensive
review of that broad spectrum of
music that is House . JP
ChOCOlate Weasel. Spaghettification ( Nlnja Rec.) • • • •
W
ith the Easter break l o o m -
ing you'll want something
to sit back and unwind to.
Something to take your mind off
the strain of exams, coursework
and all that shit. C h o c o l a t e
Weasel's Spaghettification could
be just the thing.
A mesmerising collection of
sample based beats ranging from
s l o w m o o d y tracks too more
upbeat high paced numbers bor-
dering on the realms of D & B . I love
the heavy electro influences run-
ning through many of these tracks
with that monosyllabic space bass
that T-Power has made his o w n .
T-Power says that "we were
trying to keep that simply bedroom
studio style" A n d they have suc-
ceeded in doing just that, taking a
look back at the roots mixed with
upfront beats. Those of y o u w h o
have heard T-Powers last album
Waveforms a wicked album but
goes off the deep end now and
then. This ones nowhere near as
dark or minimal as Waveforms, it's
a much more accessible album.
This ones packed full of TV film
samples and even street preachers
as in Rambling going on about
global pollution, Weasenstein with
a sample from a early Frankenstein
film 1 think, and Flying Saucers with
not surprisingly samples from TV
films and news about flying
saucers all superbly blended with
c h o p p e d and stretched beats 'n'
breaks and they all work so well.
All this is not as serious as it
might s o u n d T - P o w e r says
"Spaghettification is a complete
parody of everything that we're
normally serious about" and Cris
adds "it's about moving away from
D&J5, because y o u can't take the
piss within D & B "
It's all the little touches that
make this such an essential piece
of listening, and they're what keep
you interested. This is also what
separates the innovators and the
imitators and Chocolate Weasel
definitely aren't the latter.
