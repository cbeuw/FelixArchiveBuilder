ICU Ex-Pres was IRA Man's Lover
All CAMPBELL
The lover of an ex-President of
Imperial College Union has been
jailed after the discovery of his
involvement in IRA activities,
including a mortar attack on
Heathrow Airport,
according to an article in
the Daily Mail newspa-
per.
The article, printed in
the 25 February edition of
the publication, was h e a d -
lined, "The m i d d l e - c l a s s
a c a d e m i c ' s love for IRA
bomber".
The b o m b i n g t o o k
place in M a r c h 1994, dur-
ing which twelve explosive
missiles were fired at the
airport. M a n y shells land-
ed in p o t e n t i a l l y lethal
locations, including s o m e
devices that landed on the
roof of busy Terminal 4
and others that fell close
to passenger p l a n e s .
Luckily all the b o m b s failed
to explode.
M i c h a e l Gallagher, the
fifty-five year o l d protagonist, w a s
convicted of c o n s p i r i n g to cause
explosions by a jury majority of
eleven to o n e . H i s girlfriend,
forty-three year o l d Dr. M a r y
Attenborough, the daughter of a
retired local g o v e r n m e n t e d u c a -
t i o n officer, w a s a p p a r e n t l y
stunned by the verdict, after giv-
ing e v i d e n c e that c o m p l e t e l y
backed Gallagher's defence. The
former IC student was born in
Walsall in the W e s t M i d l a n d s and
j o i n e d the Y o u n g C o m m u n i s t
The police got their first major
lead on the b o m b i n g w h e n they
were contacted by Colin Garneys,
a businessman w h o s e suspicions
had been a r o u s e d by the
bomber's activities. Gallagher had
been renting a lockup garage for
several m o n t h s from M r .
G a r n e y s under a false
name. The police subse-
quently bugged the rental
c o m p a n y ' s phone line, a n d
| thus began a t w o - y e a r
surveillance o p e r a t i o n .
Gallagher's c o n v e r s a t i o n s
were also m o n i t o r e d at the

house, where the couple

job may have been a factor, with
eighty-hour w e e k s a c o m m o n
occurrence. According to a source
close to the accused, the ploy may
have been inspired by the Oxford
University student newspaper
Cherwell which last year attached a
number of cannabis seeds to each
issue.
Details have yet to emerge on
the possible implications for the
editor and indeed the newspaper
itself, but the student contributors
were said to be bewildered by the
news. O n e writer said: "It's terrible;
it was difficult enough to get every-
thing finished on time even with the
support and guidance of a full-time
sabbatical officer. Eddie is coping
admirably, but I hope for Jeremy's
sake, and for the sake of the paper,
that these allegations prove to be
false." It remains to be seen
whether M r Thomson will be avail-
able to compete his duties next
term. However, it is expected that
he will be granted bail by today.
While it is still not known if the
accusations are true, anyone in
possession of a copy of Felix 1111
is advised to surrender it to any of
the Imperial College Security
lodges. Under no circumstances
should any attempt to ingest the
cover be made, as the quantities of
any drug that may be present are
unknown and could be hazardous.

Several societies could face
severe cuts in their budgets fol-
lowing Union Finance Council
(UFC) proposals.
The intention is that the
motorised mascots societies for
the R S M U , RCSU and C&.GU as well
as the ICU Art Society will receive
virtually no subsidy from the Union
next year.
Following a Budget Advisory
Group (BAG) meeting in which the
budgets of all ICU societies were
reviewed, a recommendation was
put forward questioning the viabili-
ty of subsidising the artsoc and the
m o t o r i s e d m a s c o t s clubs. O n
Tuesday 1 7 M a r c h , the U F C held a
meeting to decide the future of
finances for the next academic year
for these societies. In an emer-
gency meeting scheduled to be
held tomorrow, a final decision will
be m a d e by Union Council on
whether Artsoc will have their bud-
get cut from £ 1 5 0 0 to £ 2 0 0 . This
will mean that money for perfor-
m a n c e tickets will have to be

The vehicles in question are
o w n e d by C&.GU (Bo the car and
Derrick the motorbike), R C S U
(Jezebel the fire-engine) and R S M U
(Clem the truck), and are thought
to be enormously valuable due to
their old age and g o o d condition.
James Watts, the motor club chair-
man for RCS, argues that if they are
left to ruin or sold because of a lack
of money that it can only be to the
detriment of the University. The
mascots are "a long standing part
of college history" that travel up
and d o w n the country assisting in
charity work and the general pro-
motion of IC "helping to fly the flag
for the University". The money
from the Union is only spent on the
maintenance of the vehicles: all
other money for petrol, etc. is pro-
vided by the volunteers that look
after them.
