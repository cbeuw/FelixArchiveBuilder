elanie M c G r a t h w o n the
1996 John Llewellyn Rhys
Prize for the best new
British writer under 35 for her first
book which has the serious sound-
ing title of Hotel Nirvana: Dreaming
of the new age in the American
desert. Going by the number of
rave reviews printed all over this,
her second novel, 1 woundn't be
suprised if it garnered her some
more awards.
Hard, soft and wet actually
refers to hardware, software and
wetware (in other words, us, peo-
ple). A h a , I bet I've lost your inter-
est now haven't I? M c G r a t h has
taken her o w n experiences and
used them as the basis for the story
which charts the voyage of discov-
ery of " M " as she explores the digi-
tal age in all it's glory. As it's written
in the first person, I assume M is
the author herself. She goes from a
c o m p l e t e novice (newbie), to
someone w h o is far more knowl-
edgeable, but is touched with a
degree of pessimism about it all.
Her initial guide in cyber space is
Nancy, her best friend. N a n c y
works in Silicon Valley as a software
marketer and it is d o w n to her to
explain some of the convolved,
technical jargon.
M in her quest to understand
what it's all about travels to various
places such as Iceland, M o s c o w
and America. In each new part of
the world she manages (with
apparent ease) to talk to the fore-
runners in their particular fields of
expertise.
McGrath is a talented writer.
She writes both fluidly and coher-
ently and it is obvious that she's
done her research. While an impor-
tant part of the novel is about tech-
nology, she never falls into the trap
of sounding like a computer manu-
al or allows it to overshadow the
characters. Anyone w h o reads this
book, especially students at
Imperial, will be able to recognise
both themselves and people they
know within it, from the techno-
phobe to the computer nerd.
The style, however, eventually
becomes alittle repetitive - M dis-
covers s o m e increasingly technical
p h e n o m e n o m and then jets off to
farflung destinations to hobnob
with those in the know. Because of
this the story begins to lapse
halfway through.
Overall, it is quite a g o o d book,
although I think someone more
knowledgeable about computers
and cyber space, in general, would
enjoy it more. The novel does,
hoever, have a stylish green and sil-
ver cover so even if never got read
it would look suitably impressive on
a bookshelf.
