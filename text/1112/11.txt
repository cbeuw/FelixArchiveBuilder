Due to a complete and foreseeable
lack of forward planning, the roast-
ing saga has clashed with this
splendid bumper special issue so
I'll do a quick resume on potatoes
before moving on to the Easter
special.
Spuds: the queen of roast veg-
etables, practically any variety will
do. W a s h your spuds but don't
bother peeling them. C h o p the
potatoes into ~ 1" cubes and put
them in a large pan with enough
water to cover. Bring to the boil
over a strong heat and leave to
simmer for 10 minutes. N o w drain
the potatoes, place a top onto the
pan and shake the pan vigorously.
This "roughens" the pieces so they
absorb m o r e fat and b e c o m e
crispy when cooked. Next pour a
generous amount of oil (and/or
butter) into the pan, sprinkle with
lots of salt, pepper and any other
herbs and give the contents a g o o d
stir. The spuds are now ready to
join whatever you've got in the
oven. They'll need at least an hour
at gas mark 5-6, 180-200°C and
it's a g o o d idea to turn them at
least once whilst they're cooking.
ROUSSETTES DILE-DE-FRANCE
So here's a "traditional French del-
icacy" which is usually cooked to
celebrate the middle of Lent, just
to give y o u some encouragement
after eating stale bread and olive
stones for however many weeks it
is.
The dough needs to rest and
chill overnight so you have to make
it the day before which this year
was the 18th M a r c h so w h o o p s
sorry, you've missed it. Still, mine
were very nice and I'm sure y o u
can do some for Easter or some-
thing.
Do be careful when using the
deep fat fryer and keep a substan-
tial wet cloth about to throw over it
if things get furious.
1 litre (550g) plain flour
3 large eggs
®- 125 g butter
1 pinch salt
a
" 1 tsp sprit (preferably fruit)
T. 1 tsp orange blossom or
rose water
«• 3-4 heaped tsp thick
cream
1 deep fat fryer
First of all, cut the butter into small
bits and put in a bowl on some-
thing w a r m like a radiator. W h e n
the butter softens (not melts) stir it
around with a fork until you've got
a smooth paste.
Place the flour and salt in a
large bowl and make a well in the
middle. Break all three eggs into
the well and, using the fork, whisk
them around in the flour. W h e n
about half the flour is incorporated
you should have a paste with a
similar consistency to the butter.
So add the butter and churn it into
the paste, picking up flour as you
go along. This might be a g o o d
time to get your hands in there -
you should end up with a stiff
dough that doesn't stick together.
And now for the really gooey
moment. A d d 2 tsp of cream to
the dough and squidge repeatedly
until the cream is absorbed. Keep
adding more cream until you get
the right consistency. For those of
you w h o have ever repair a win-
dow, you're looking for something
with the s a m e consistency as
putty, fairly stiff but plastic.
That's it for now, wrap up in
cellophane and leave in the fridge
for the night.
The next day, lightly flour a clean
surface and using your favourite
rolling pin (mine's a litre bottle of
Scotch) roll out the dough until it's
2 - 3 m m thick.
Use a blunt knife to cut the
pastry into lozenges. Press the
knife d o w n onto the pastry rather
than dragging it across so that the
edges are well sealed. This will
help the roussettes to expand in
the cooking. O n e of those dinky
pastry wheel jobbies would be per-
fect for the job.
To cook the roussettes, heat
the oil up gently and plop the
lozenges in a few at a time. I don't
k n o w what temperature this
needs, I've always used trial and
error. What should happens is that
after a couple of seconds, the
lozenge expands from the steam
produced inside it and pops up to
the surface of the oil. Leave it for
10 seconds and then flip it over
with a suitable utensil. After anoth-
er 10 seconds take the roussettes
out and place on s o m e absorbent
material. At this point and despite
its name, the roussette should be
just golden yellow (ahh) not brown.
If it is brown, the oil's too hot.
Finally, sprinkle your rous-
sette with icing sugar and scoff
with a bit of jam.
