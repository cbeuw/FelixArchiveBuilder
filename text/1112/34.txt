Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne
Director: Randall Wallace * * *
Leonardo DiCaprio heads the all-star
cast of The Man in the Iron Mask
honourable a n d caring brother.
DiCaprio, the m a n of the
m o m e n t , clearly relishes the
variation in his roles. While not
quite convincing as the powerful,
scowling king, he is in his element
25 March 1998
when playing the timid sibling. H e
must also have enjoyed leading
such a distinguished cast, although
it seems as if Irons, Malkovich and
the rest couldn't quite agree on
whether t o c a m p it up entirely or
play everything straight. The
atrocious dialogue would favour
the former, yet Irons in particular
takes his role seriously, even when
endlessly repeating, " O n e for all, all
for o n e . " There is also inevitable
confusion o n pronunciation a n d
accent since the Musketeers come
from three different countries.
But o n e can't be t o o harsh o n a
film which is clearly aiming to be an
amusing couple of hours rather
than an epic. Ignoring the prestige
of the names o n the title sequence
will allow the audience to sit back
and let the Saturday matinee script
and swashbuckling roll over them.
Even then, s o m e m a y find the
cheesiness of the finale hard to
stomach, but in terms of mindless
enjoyable n o n s e n s e for w o m e n
especially, The Man in the Iron
Mask is fine. Q

S
creenwriter Joe Esterhas is a m a n of rare
insight. Having m a d e his name by showing
a generation of steelworkers that there is
more to life than welding in dance-as-symbol-
of-freedom classic Flashdance, a n d dissected
the nature of obsession in the infamous Basic
Instinct, he now draws o n his o w n experience to
tell the story of a y o u n g Hungarian immigrant to
the United States.
It is the early sixties in Cleveland O h i o , a n d
Brad Renfro is desparate to b e c o m e an
American. H e is enchanted by the world of rock
and roll, so when he is offered the chance to
work for DJ Kevin Bacon he eagerly grabs it.
Renfro learns all about the American w a y of
doing things w h e n he becomes involved in some
dodgy dealings with a record company.
It c o m e s as no surprise that this is Esterhas'
pet project. The subject matter is far less lurid
than his recent output, and not the sort of thing
that screams commercial success. His assertion
that the basis of the script w a s written many
years ago is very easy to believe, as the plot
stumbles from o n e adolescent fantasy to the
next. This is a semi-autobiographical tale, with
the emphasis firmly o n the " s e m i " . Unless, of
course, a vice girl really d i d service the seven-
teen year o l d Esterhas outside the confines of
his imagination.
This film treats a potentially interesting sub-
ject in a boring, a n d at times ludicrous, manner.
There is perhaps o n e entertaining moment in
the whole film, but it fails to atone for the hour
and a half of self-indulgent n o n s e n s e l l

short films before 247, his
first feature-length picture,
and put the experience he gained
to g o o d use in creating an intelli-
gent a n d moving film.
247 is shot entirely in black a n d
white, which helps to convey its
message a n d give the audience a
clearer insight into the characters'
world. The film is set in a n d around
a housing estate in Nottingham a n d
centres around a group of lads w h o
cannot break their 2 4 7 . 2 4 hours a
day, 7 days a week their lives
remain exactly the s a m e - signing
on a n d hanging around o n the
streets doing nothing except get-
ifk.it it
ting into trouble. However, there is
one m a n , B o b Hoskins, w h o tries
to install some purpose into their
lives by starting u p a boxing club.
Hoskins is a lonely m a n , a n d it is
possible to think that he starts up
the club to give himself some direc-
tion. Although this is true in part,
his real motive is t o help others a n d
to form a sense of community.
Everything goes well for them until
their first match with another box-
ing club, when Hoskins can no
longer tolerate o n e of the lads'
fathers w h o beats his wife and s o n .
This film has many themes run-
ning through it a n d is also quite
funny in places as the characters
Hoskins discusses tactics with his boys
attempt to c o p e with their
situation. Shane M e a d o w s puts
across the message that every
single person, is special a n d
demonstrates this through Hoskins
himself. W e see him at the begin-
ning of the film as a tramp living in
an o l d train carriage. W e learn of
his story through the film a n d by
the e n d w e really care for this old
t r a m p , d u e mainly to o n e of
Hoskin's finest performances. H e is
also ably supported by the support
cast w h o include many actors in
their first role.

little bit different, I would definitely
