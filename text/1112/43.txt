Hullo me dearies.
Well it seems that the h a m m e r drill
of history has once more been
plunged into quivering vicar's
abdomen of time and another term
is at an end. To celebrate this your
beloved Felix has been imbued with
a splash of colour.
Speaking of colour (watch this
link) 1 must congratulate all those
who have been awarded College
colours (Look at that! Perfectly
seamless. Quality journalism that
is). The achievements in '97 of the
College's sports heroes have been
acknowledged. O f course I have no
doubt that for every person w h o
received an a w a r d , there w e r e
countless others equally deserving.
To those people I offer my s y m p a -
thies and can only remind them of
the words of M r James Brown;
"I've got mine, w h o cares about his
(or hers)." Congratulations must
go to Jenny C o x w h o w o n
Sportsperson of the Year a n d
Charlie Joynt w h o w a s judged
Sports Personality of the Year.
As anyone w h o pays any atten-
tion to the goings on in the Felix
sports pages (yes I know what
you're thinking but just exercise
some willing suspension of disbe-
lief) will be aware, this term marks
the debut of both me and my jolly
band of helpers. I would therefore
like to thank the various sports
teams for being patient and under-
standing with me. For those of y o u
who have not been patient and
understanding, a) Please disregard
the previous statement and b) why
don't y o u bugger off and dive into
the nearest sewer like the miser-
able vermin that y o u are.
Whilst it pains me to touch on
this subject, I feel that 1 must c o m -
ment upon the sad events involving
your friend and mine, Felix editor
Jeremy T h o m s o n . It is a terrible
state of affairs that people are so
quick to pounce upon the misfor-
tunes of others for their o w n
amusement. For myself, I stand
four square behind Jeremy. I ask
you to consider this, is it a crime to
douse copies of Felix in illegal
drugs in an attempt to induce mass
hallucinations? Think about it.
In a way I feel in somewhat
guilty for Jeremy's predicament.
When he told me of his desire for
people to appreciate Felix on a
whole new level, I was very sup-
portive. Of course 1 had no idea of
the lengths to which he was plan-
ning to go.
This plan is not new, every
week members of certain sports
teams provide me with reports
soaked in beer, presumably as part
of s o m e plan to get me drunk;
Jeremy's current ordeal should,
however, make them a pause for
thought.
It cannot have escaped your
attention by n o w that I a m writing
nonsense. This is due to a desper-
ate attempt to fill the two pages
that I have been assigned. I must
say that I a m most disappointed by
the lack of articles for this, the last
issue of term. 1 a m sure that many
of y o u were involved in sporting
contests, surely y o u can all have
lost under humiliating c i r c u m -
stances (ski team).
Erm, sports. M u s t fill space,
must concentrate on sports, must
concentrate on tea, must concen-
trate on hot, steaming tea. O o h
tea. Tea and biscuits, tea and
cakes, o o h cakes, lovely, sweet
cakes. N o not cakes, sport! Err
sports, must focus, mustn't think
of Boney M , mustn't think of Rah
Rah Rasputin lover of the Russian
queen, there was a cat w h o really
w a s g o n e . Rah Rah Rasputin
Russia's greatest love machine, it
was a shame h o w he carried on.
Arrrgh Sports! M u s t write about
sports, sports, not releasing
anthrax into the L o n d o n
Underground, laughing as people
make the journeys, little suspecting
the tortured d e a t h that awaits
them, dancing with joy as the b o d -
ies pile up like rotting pyramids of
death. That'll show them, always
talking about me, tripping me up,
reading my brainwaves, they
thought I didn't know, but 1 d o and
my vengeance shall be swift and
terrible.
Well that little journey into my
stream of consciousness seems to
have filled up s o m e space, it only
remains for me to say that whilst I
shall continue for as long as possi-
ble next term, at s o m e point I shall
have to take the few paltry scraps
of information 1 have acquired over
the last year and try to stick them
together in the hope that they
vaguely resemble a degree. Still I
have no doubt that my colleagues
Dave and Niall shall prove them-
selves more than capable of filling
the v a c u u m that my departure shall
create.
War! Hurl G o o d G o d ! What is it
g o o d for?

Last Saturday, four u n g u i d e d ,
novice fencers blundered d o w n to
Reading to compete in the national
annual novice fencing tournament.
The tournament began and
Imperial were up against Sussex;
despite 'Conan' style hacking and
slashing from the Sussex team the
match was w o n thanks to steady
defence and deadly accuracy from
John 'I'm glad she was knackered'
Claeys.
Despite this victory w e went on
to lose our next three matches,
including our match against East
Anglia A w h o incidentally went on
to win the tournament. After a final
narrow defeat w e were tired,
pissed off and ready to go; howev-
er we were required to enter the
play-offs which were due to start in
an hour; so w e went d o w n the pub.
Refreshed, w e returned and,
under the sterling guidance of the
manic Dr Dennis 'Don't be shy'
Garriga-Majo, went on to win three
matches in a row with the alcoholi-
cally fuelled and aggressive Andrew
'Doesn't hit girls' Schnoes wreaking
foil-like havoc with a succession of
opponents. The final match was a
tense d e c i d e r w h i c h eventually
went to Alex ' O n e pint won't hurt'
Griffin, after which w e realised that
w e had in fact w o n the play-offs
and were the recipients of our very
own bottle of wine.
So Imperial returned semi-vic-
torious, proving that y o u don't
have to be part of any team to win
and that alcohol definitely does not
impair performance.
