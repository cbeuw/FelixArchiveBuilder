orruption of p o w e r , the
rights of the G o d s over the
rights of men, the pride of a
father, the devotion of a family.
These are some of the many issues
that are dealt with in Forbidden
Theatre's innovative and thought
provoking production of Antigone -
Sophocles' Greek tragedy about
love, death, revenge and honour.
The chorus scenes were performed
in the physical theatre style that is
fast becoming Forbidden's trade
mark. The cast w o r k e d together
very well as a group and put a lot of
energy into these scenes. It is such
a pity then that these scenes never
fully realised the full potential of
the ideas. W h e n the choreography
served to enhance and a d d depth
to the text, it w o r k e d well and
there was s o m e effective imagery.
At other times, however, I was at a
loss to determine the function of
some of the movements.
There was a g o o d contrast
between these highly visual scenes
and the more conventional style of
the scenes between the characters,

which preserved the distant nature
of the chorus. The transition
between the t w o styles though
lacked a certain fluidity. M y o w n
favourite scene was the impas-
sioned argument between the king
and his son. The actors created a
bond of sympathy between the
characters and the audience lead-
ing to perhaps the most dramatic
part of the play. This effect was
only marginally detracted from by
the fact that the staging meant it
was impossible to watch them both
at the same time.
Whilst Forbidden s h o u l d be
c o m p l i m e n t e d for having the
courage to attempt to perform the
play in this way, the lack of polish
resulted in a performance that
never quite fulfilled its promise.

FIDDLER ON THE ROOF
ULU
F
iddler on the Roof, by Joseph
Stein, is unlike many musi-
cals, in that it actually has a
fairly sizeable plot. It follows the
lives of a very close knit Jewish
c o m m u n i t y in pre-Revolutionary
Russia. The story concerns the
loves, trials, and tribulations of
people w h o are eventually forced
to move away from their humble
dwellings by the corrupt Russian
police. The plot reflects the views
of a bigoted Russian government.
The c o m p a n y of performers,
under the direction of Kirsty
Bennett and Stephen Brown, were
of an extremely high standard.
Both principal and chorus roles
were played w i t h energy and
enthusiasm, and all involved are to
be highly congratulated. It is cer-
tainly one of the better amateur
performances I have seen in recent
years.

THE LOCAL
Standpoint Gallery
M
an walks into a pub. Goes
over to the fag machine
for 20 M a r l b o r o Lights.
There is no fag machine. Decides
to spaz five quid on a fruit machine
instead. There are no fruit
machines. Sod it. He'll calm himself
d o w n with a bottle of Pils. There is
no Pils. There are no drinks at all.
N o barstaff. N o bar.
In fact, it's not a pub - it's an art
gallery, the Standpoint Gallery to
be exact, and I've stumbled into an
exhibition called 'The Local'.
Ostensibly, 'The Local' tackles the
great British institution of The Pub.
What actually happens is that 'The
Local' puts a pint of lager on the
table and then drops a piano on
the head of anyone w h o tries to
drink it. The theme of 'The Pub' acts
as a c o n c e p t u a l beachhead,
designed to melt into the wings
and allow deeply personal themes
to take centre-stage once the
punter is hooked. Not fair? W h o
said that getting punters to "engage
brain w h e n entering gallery" was
going to be fair? Three artists are
showing: Richard Elliot, Stephen
Perkin and Sophie Newell. Their
work is both complementary and
synergic, and an awesome sense of
space flowsthroughout the exhibi-
tion.
Richard Elliot confronts us with
a seemingly mundane blown-up
photograph of an ashtray, taken
using a tiny depth of field so that
the bright lights of the bar in the
background are blurred, distant,
moving away. The separation of
the ashtray from its surroundings is
jarring, and forces us to confront
what we feel about the object's
space, the space where we think it
was, the space where we think it is,
the space it took with it on its jour-
ney from pub to photograph in a
gallery. W e are made to feel that
we need to fill in the gaps, to imag-
ine what might have been, and
Elliot's photographs emphasise this
by their absence of people. He
makes people more interesting by
not showing t h e m to us, giving us
instead their space-prints, their
vapour-trails.
Sophie Newell has installed a
small r o o m in the gallery. There are
no obvious clues that the room
c o m e s from a pub. Instead, it sug-
gests a set of deeply e m b e d d e d
associations: the dark polyester
carpet says it's had Doberman shit
sponged out of it once or twice;
the garish turquoise lighting says
it's probably seen the o d d feverish
grope; the e m b o s s e d burgundy
wallpaper can't repeat what it's
heard. Newell is creating a concep-
tual space for us to venture into,
and it's almost as if the installation
exists only to tell us what is miss-
ing, what we need to fill in our-
selves. Yet again, we get that famil-
iar jarring sensation that comes-
from seeing an object so far out of
context, having to confront what it
really means to us for the first time.
The themes of jarred contexts
and e m p t y s p a c e s run right
through 'The Local'. It is a relatively
small exhibition, but what it lacks in
quantity it easily makes up for in
strength of purpose. It is a deeply
personal experience and it makes
an ideal starting point for novice art
connoisseurs and confused pun-
ters alike. A w o r d of warning,
though. Take a hard hat and watch
out for pianos.
