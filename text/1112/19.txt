Cadbury's Flake
Price: £2.99
Description: Boring.
Comments: The packaging is
absolutely hideous, comprising of
lurid purple flowers on a bilious yel-
low background. Inside, the choco-
late is a sugary ambrosia, appealing
to only the sweetest tooth. Those
with more sober tastes may enjoy
the accompanying Flakes.
The Verdict: W h y doesn't it have
the woman in the bath on the box?

Sainsbury's Rich
Dark
Price: £2.99
Description: Faux-swanky dark
chocolate affair ideal for middle-class
dinner parties with a low budget.
Comments: Fake Bournville choco-
late, dark but not bitter enough for
the miserable old editor. C o m e s
with after-dinner choccies that,
despite all claims to the contrary,
taste minty. A n adult's egg.
The Verdict: Like meeting an old
friend and finding that they have
become as dull and conventional as
yourself. • • # •
Nestle Maverick
Price: £2.99
Description: The meat and t w o veg
of the Easter egg world.
Comments: Dull, unaesthetic pack-
aging for an dull, unaesthetic prod-
uct. Don't believe the hype, it's just
two standard chocolate bars and a
low-quality egg.
The Verdict: I'd rather eat my
Vauxhall Corsa. * •
Sainsbury's
Easter Bunny
Price: £3.99
Description: A twee-looking
twelve-inch rabbit complete with
white chocolate tail and eyes.
Comments: After chewing its ear
off, Tim's facial expressions passed
through disappointment and disgust,
finally settling on a rather distorted
despair. This bunny, ladies and gen-
tlemen, is a hideous, rubbery
monster.
The Verdict: Avoid it like Myxima-
tosis. A big fat zero.
Sainsbury's
Belgian Egg
Price: £4.99 (although they forgot to
charge us for this one).
Description: Fancy-dandy conti-
nental luxury job .
Comments: Well presented with
the minimum of plastic, the choco-
late has a rippled surface rather like a
tortoise's back. Good firm texture
and dark taste, although they've still
used hydrogenated vegetable fats.
Comes with six heavenly Belgian
petits-fois.
The Verdict: Somewhere between
a panther and a ginger torn.
Guylian
Price: £4.99
Description: Belgian chocolate egg
with half a box of those seashell
things. N o t a bad price when you see
how much they usually cost.
Comments: Bloody hell,
this is soooo gorgeous!
The chocolate is absoluel-
ty superb, and the seashells are the
two pee sweets from heaven - so
rich it's unwise to eat more than one
or two. The best egg so far by far.
The Verdict: Sex on a stick. 5. The
essential egg.
Galaxy Giant Egg
Price: £9.99
Description: It's immense. It's big-
ger than my head. What more could
you want?
Comments: The choccy is decided-
ly creamier and less sickly than the
usual Cadbury's / Nestle fodder.
Comes with a huge Galaxy bar on
the side, we're talking about nearly a
kilo of chocolate, presented in a box
the size of a suitcase. Possibly fatal if
eaten in one sitting.
The Verdict: For big kids and lardy-
arses. • '/2
