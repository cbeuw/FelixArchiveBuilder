tudying and living at university
can sometimes be stressful and
lonely as well as challenging and
exciting. The courses at Imperial
College are d e m a n d i n g ; ' they require
commitment of time and effort. It s
not unusual to experience a knock to your self-esteejijpo find your-
self amongst similarly intelligent students after having ||jen at or near
the top of your class at school.
You might have arrived at Imperial from another country with differ-
ent social and cultural norms so that part of beginning at College
involves the experience of living in a different culture. Family and
friends may be a long distance away. A n d if you're c o m i n g to College
straight from home y o u may have to learn the practicalities of every-
day living as well! C o m i n g to university might be one of the biggest
transitions y o u ' re going to make in your life.
If you're not used to organising yourself and getting o n with studying
without a parent or teacher prompting y o u , it can be a considerable
challenge to manage your work. O n the other hand, sometimes stu-
dents work too hard and get diminishing returns; fear of failure or 'let-
ting people d o w n ' can get in the way of constructive studying.
All of this needs energy which y o u might have plenty of. However,
sometimes personal issues d e m a n d energy which you would other-
wise be using to get on with your life. Sometimes you'll know what
the problem is, eg a relationship difficulty, a bereavement, an issue
about self-confidence. But sometimes you might be aware of feeling
depressed or anxious, of finding it difficult to concentrate at lectures
or when studying, for no immediately identifiable reason.
M a n y students have found it useful to c o m e to counselling when
they're feeling troubled, to talk about their experience, to think
through a problem and to consider options and create a strategy to
move forward. Issues students have brought since I took up post last
September include: blocks to studying and exam stress; relationship
difficulties; family difficulties; homesickness; depression; anxiety;
bereavement: sexuality and sexual orientation.
The service is confidential. To arrange an appointment, telephone me
on 0171 594 9 4 3 0 (internal 49430) or contact me via email:

T
he Advice Service exists to provide
information on a wide range of practi-
cal and legal issues including housing
rights, council tax, immigration, consumer
matters, debt, and fundraising, anything
that isn't purely a personal matter.
I will try and make sure that y o u are aware of your options in a given situa-
tion so you can choose how you want to deal with it. In some circum-
stances, your choice of action may carry consequences that are not imme-
diately apparent and a different perspective can often be useful.
I work from a large information system and the Union subscribes to several
organisations that provide assistance for certain student groups (for exam-
ple U K C O S A , w h o provide a service to international students).
I a m familiar with the problems and incidents that student's c o m m o n l y face.
For example, I deal with many enquiries regarding private sector housing
matters ranging from checking contracts to problems with disrepair, harass-
ment and other inter-tenant disputes.
1 can also help students with financial problems. Debt is inevitable for most
students. If you think your finances are running out then c o m e and see me.
Sometimes (though not often) there are benefits that can be claimed, pay-
ments that can be reduced (particularly credit debts), and other organisa-
tions w h o might be able to offer financial help.
Occasionally it is necessary to refer students to outside agencies, maybe to
get specialised legal advice, or for support and help for a particular client
group. There may also be occasions where it will be appropriate to refer you
to other members of College staff (ie perhaps the Counsellor, College
Tutors, or Disabilities Officer). In any event, your situation will not be dis-
cussed with anyone else without your express permission.
The Advice Service is strictly confidential, impartial and non-judgemental. It
doesn't matter what your situation is, or h o w y o u arrived at it. M y job is to
try and assist, not to apportion blame.
I can be seen by appointment 1 1.00-4.30pm on M o n d a y , Wednesday and
Friday and between 10.30-4.00pm on Tuesday and Thursday. To make an
appointment, contact the Union reception on x.48060. I can also be con-
tacted on the telephone on x. 4 8 0 6 7 and by email; m.m.thomson@ic.ac.uk.
I will always see urgent enquiries without an appointment and no question
or matter is too big or too small. 1 a m also very happy to speak to interna-
tional students with any questions that might arise from cultural differences
between the UK and your home country.
