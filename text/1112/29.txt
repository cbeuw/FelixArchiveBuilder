Think of d r u m ' n ' b a s s , think of
London, Bristol, the UK; think of
Goldie, Roni Size, DJ Die; think of
Full Cycle, V, Metalheadz, M o v i n g
Shadow. If those are the images
that this musical style conjure up
for you then prepare for a shock.
Think of d r u m ' n ' b a s s again!
Think of all of the above. N o w a d d
some names to those lists. Think of
Germany; think of Frankfurt,
Mannheim, Berlin, H a m b u r g and
M u n i c h . Think of C o m p o s t
Records, Force a n d Paul, 'Into
Something, and Fauna Flash...
Fauna Flash! About four years
ago two Bavarians from M u n i c h
began making music together. To
begin with it was electronic music.
As their production skills increased,
it evolved into drum'n'bass. Fauna
Flash soon teamed up with M i c h a e l
Reinboth, the founder of the very
influential M u n i c h - b a s e d label,
Compost Records. N o w w e have a
new album from Roland a n d
Cristian (aka Fauna Flash) called the
Experimental Kitchen. Look out for
it in g o o d record stores N O W !
As if the Fauna Flash project
wasn't enough, the boys have also
t e a m e d up with Rainer Truby,
another C o m p o s t artist w h o hails
from Freiburg, in the Rhein Valley to
form the Rainer Truby Trio. Rainer is
a star in the UK eclectic under-
ground, with critical acclaim c o m -
ing from Giles Peterson and the
Talkin' Loud Collective and also
M o ' W a x , etc. It is also said he has
a vast record collection of priceless
jazz and funk and fusion. Definitely
a DJ to check out next time he is at
the Blue Note!
The Rainer Truby Trio's big
break came w h e n they were asked
to remix Plis Infinis N o 2 from
France's Frederic Galliano (a big
star on the international electronic
jazz circuit) on Laurent Garnier's
label F-Communications. The remix
is, in most people's opinion, the
highlight of the EP. Subtle Brazilian
rhythms shuffle along dreamily, and
the scene is set for a great piece of
music.
I was lucky enough to meet up
with Roland and Cristian during a
recent tour of the UK. The first
thing I wanted to know was how
they c o u l d best describe their
music. Since d r u m ' n ' b a s s has
crossed over to Germany, it has
gone through some subtle changes.
"The m a i n thing is
drum'n'bass." Replies Roland, "But
it's a special view of drum'n'bass;
very jazz-orientated, but not in the
jazz-style of, say Bukem. It's more
original jazz samples and the sound
is a little bit harder than the normal
jazz stuff."
So how did Fauna Flash c o m e
about? "We've known each other
for over fifteen years." Continues
Roland, " W e played as drummers
in teenage school bands, and lived
in the same area of M u n i c h . W e
started working together in this
type of music three or four years
ago, because we didn't want to
stay in the drummer's seat! W e
were in rock bands, jazz bands,
fusion outfits. Everything!"
It is this openness and need to
embrace as many different types of
music as possible that led to a tran-
sition from being a part of the band
to actually being responsible
towards the entire musical output.
" W e were always interested in
rhythms and beats. That's what is
so exciting about drum'n'bass. But
at the same time we were listening
to jazz and fusion. That's the back-
ground of Fauna Flash."
During his period as a drum-
mer, Cristian was slowly getting
into electronic music. "I saved up
for a sampler and some sequencing
stuff and 1 was trying acoustic
drums with electronic percussion.
W h e n me and Roland became a
collective it w a s because w e
weren't satisfied in playing just in
bands anymore; playing other peo-
ple's music. W e wanted to d o
something alone. W e didn't decide
'now we're going to go into c o m -
puters or now we're going to d o
d r u m ' n ' b a s s . ' It just h a p p e n e d
slowly but surely."
O n e of the first appearances
that Fauna Flash made together
was at a big techno rave with an
entirely new concept. "We hooked
to play at a rave with two drum sets
and s o m e ambient records."
Explains Cristian, "That's what got
us into this whole dance thing. It

was a whole new scene for us
because we were always playing in
jazz clubs or at rock concerts."
" W e got invited and I would say
that w e were o p e n - m i n d e d enough
to try it out. So it was 'Let's go for
it and see what happens.' W e just
went for it! Less is more. W e
played simple beats together and
people got into it."
Both Roland and Cristian cite
their musical heroes as "Weather
Report, Yellow Jackets, Miles Davis,
C a m e o , all P-Funk music, Roy Ayers
and the 80's!"
The Rainer Truby Trio began
after fauna Flash was an estab-
lished and respected outfit. "We
spent a lot of time together (with
Rainer). So we thought, because of
the jazz background we have, we
wanted to have another project.
A n o t h e r thing that wasn't just
drum'n'bass. Fauna Flash is just
h e a d i n g d o w n one alley. With
Rainer and his jazz background we
said 'Let's d o RTT to get this other
musical form out to the people.'"
The U K underground, whether
it be the jazz c o m m u n i t y or the
d'n'b sceneis seriously getting into
the sounds of FF and the RTT. This
is the music that will prove whether
drum'n'bass is a truly international
art form, or a cliquey U K thang!
