No 1112: A load of balls
After the ridiculously cruel and
harsh trick of Jeremy's " N o
Bridges Please" utilities problem
last issue, w e are back with a
more conventional (i.e. logically
soluble) puzzle this week. You,
for reasons unexplained, have
been given twelve apparently
identical balls. O n e of the d o z e n ,
however, has gone rogue. It has a
ever so slightly different weight
than its uniform brethren. Your
mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to determine which is
the errant sphere, and also fath-
o m whether the ball is heavier or
lighter than its contemporaries.
To aid y o u in your quest, y o u
have the use of a pair of c o m m o n
or garden scales. The catch, and
there always is a catch, is that
you can use the balance only
three times. It can be done, I
promise... Mr.Trout
Cheeky M r . T h o m s o n gave y o u an insoluble puzzle last time;
provided y o u are limited to two dimensions y o u cannot con-
nect up the houses. The smartarse w h o felt fit to inform us of
this fact was a Miss Janet Evans. I bet y o u w o n ' t get this
week's though. Bring ' e m on, 1 prefer a straight fight...etc...
Mail or e-mail your answers to the Felix office (felix@ic.ac.uk). If cor-
rect your name will be printed in not a large blaze of glory next issue.
Contributions of similar logic / maths puzzles gratefully received.

ONLY A DROP
This week most of us are looking
forward to the end of term, going
home and settling d o w n to four
weeks of uninterrupted revision.
For the Felix Office, however, it will
be a trying and difficult month.
Jeremy's arrest has left us without
a full time editor and mentor.
Whilst us few remaining in the
office will of course try our best, we
would appreciate any aid that our
readers could provide in this most
testing time. It is a testament to
the skill and dedication of the
remaining staff that we managed to
complete this issue. Well done to
all of y o u . W e wish Jeremy and his
family the best of luck and pray
that he can beat this terrible and
false slur against his g o o d name.
H o w a r d M a r k s is holding on page

DRUGS, OFFICER?
This brings us o n to the
Independent on Sunday's ma
this Saturday in H y d e Park (page
three). The cannabis issue has
been discussed in Felix on several
occasions, not least by my prede-
cessor (alas, poor Jeremy...). For
my part I hope the demonstration
passes peacefully and is not
hijacked by people just there for a
laugh. This is a serious issue, and I
would urge any students going on
Saturday not to d o anything that
would reflect badly on the c a m -
paign. Having said that, I'll see you
there, and I'll be smiling.
IT'S NOT CRICKET! BREASTS
As terrible as Jeremy's arrest is, an
even greater horror has entered my
life in the last few days. I a m refer-
ring, of course, to the West Indian
bowlers. It appears that nothing
short of a brick wall can stop their
merciless attack on England's bats-
men. A n d even the wall might not
work. It seems only a few weeks
since England strode victorious off
the field ['Thought for the Day',
Felix I 108] - hang on, it is only a
few weeks! Exactly what have M r
Atherton and his motley crew been
up to in the intervening period? 1
reckon that Phil Tufnell has taken
the team on an excursion into the
countryside, perhaps with one of
those hand-rolled cigarettes
In Jeremy's absence, we would like
to take the opportunity to redress
the balance. It is a sad fact that
Felix has printed no breasts what-
soever, despite including seven-
teen male behinds and at least
three penises. Without in any way
questioning Jeremy's sexuality, we
have decided to print this picture
of two colossal wabs.
