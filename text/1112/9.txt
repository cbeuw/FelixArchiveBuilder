25 March 1998 COLUMNS
Once you've been at Imperial for
a while, you soon realise that
simplicity rarely features strong-
ly in the thinking of our lords
and masters. Last week, for
example, we came top in the
HEFCE funding tables, easily
beating lesser establishments in
the Fens and west of London.
Across the College, we have
been more successful than many
in securing extra funding grants
from industry and research
councils, which has helped IC
pass the £ 3 0 0 million mark. Yet
despite all this, the College are
now seeking to deprive the
Union of £ 4 2 , 0 0 0 generated by
STA Travel; incidentally, this fig-
ure is not far off the amount
spent in 1996/97 redecorating
and refurbishing the palatial 170
Queen's Gate, about £ 4 9 , 0 0 0 .
Though I would be the first to
admit that ICU does not dis-
pense all of its cash in the most
effective manner, it is difficult to
believe that this latest move is
anything but sour grapes from
the denizens of Suite Five, who
failed to make the Union pay for
the refurbishment of the JCR, a
College facility. Were the Union
to stump up for the renovation
of College facilities, it would set
a dangerous precedent, in much
the same way that Labour's tin-
kering with National Lottery is
worrying. Such poor judgement,
tinged with bitterness, hypocrisy
and naivete, does the Rector no
credit at all, and must be
reversed immediately. The last
time 1 looked,
the College had
cash balances of
£ 1 4 million, fur-
ther weakening
the case for
raiding the
Union's coffers.
Furthermore, the
whole sorry saga
highlights the
misplaced prior-
ities of the
College. The JCR
is seen purely as
a cost rather than a benefit. If
we continue to run down facili-
ties for students, we will find it
progressively more difficult to
attract applications. We cannot
survive purely on past glories -
we must provide a high quality
education in a high quality envi-
ronment. Were this underfund-
ing limited to social facilities,
the effects might mot be critical,
but one only has to wander

through teaching labs around
Imperial to see how Campus
Renaissance is largely an exer-
cise in window dressing, failing
to address major weaknesses in
favour of the odd fountain here
and there. Yes, we have the shiny
new BMS, but if we persist in
neglecting our
facilities, its
arrival will
merely exacer-
bate the prob-
lem in years to
come, when
one considers
that its mainte-
nance budget
will be almost
60% of Estates

provision. Since
many senior College staff have
little time for undergraduates,
let me approach this from a dif-
ferent angle. If we let this place
continue to decay, it will not be
long before industrial sponsors
go elsewhere. Now do you see
my point?
The Budget, as a rule, should
not set the pulse racing, since
fiscal policy, like nuclear
weaponry, is a area
where panic is best
avoided. O n reflection, Gordon
Brown talked much and said lit-
tle. Normally an occasion where
governments are more forth-
coming than usual, he still man
aged to pack in a few New
Labour vagaries and platitudes.
Taxing child benefit will be
'investigated', though reforming
one of the most unjustifiable
universal benefits should be rel-
atively straightforward. While
being tight on spending, he did
nothing to rein in the pound,
which has clear consequences
for exporters. There were some
good ideas, many of them mun-
dane but nonetheless useful, but
overall one cannot help but
notice that the Budget has failed
to live up to the carefully
orchestrated leaks and spin.
This was not quite as prudent as
Gordon suggested, and is per-
haps explained by the New
Labour belief that you can fool
all of the people all of the time.
Thought For the Day
Sex
L
ooking back o n it, it s e e m s
difficult to believe that I orig-
inally learnt the following epi-
gram from a skateboard magazine:
that was back in my fourteen-year
old days of dirty Cons 100 basket-
ball boots, track-suit b o t t o m s
and... well, track-suit tops. The epi-
gram sums up life rather well, and it
goes something like this: "Life is a
100% fatal, sexually transmitted
disease." M o s t people are likely to
find that this handful of words does
not quite typify their experience o n
the subject, but I reckon any cynic
worth his or her salt will be in full
agreement. M y opinion, in case
anyone is interested, is utterly irrel-
evant: it's been so long since 1 last
had sex that I honestly can't
remember enough to c o m m e n t .
For s o m e bizarre reason, sex
has a firm stigma of h u m o u r
attached to it, and this s e e m s to be
interpreted differently in England to
the w a y it is in any other nation.
Think about the best (and the
worst) jokes that y o u have heard
recently; h o w many w o u l d y o u
consider a tad o n the salacious
side? It seems strange that some-
thing which is traditionally not dis-
c u s s e d in polite conversation
results in a great many chuckles
and guffaws in bars and o n TV
shows across the country. ("Huh
huh. Y o u said "column".")
S o m e o n e once told m e , in their
infinite w i s d o m , that the offhand
portrayal of sex o n the television
was a thing not to be encouraged,
for a number of reasons including
distortion of the minds of impres-
sionable y o u n g adolescents. She
reckoned sex should be what y o u
make of it. Y o u might be doubtful
about this assertion, but y o u should
also be able to see the truth in it;
I'd be very surprised if anybody
reading this has done it Sharon
Stone style. Teenagers w h o model
their sexual style o n the contortions
of over-made up actors on Sky
M o v i e s O n e are likely to spend
most of their time in the bedroom
attempting to find a piece of cloth
long enough to tie their partner to
the bed. Alternatively, they search
the length of the King's Road for a
pair of fishnet stockings, rather
than shopping for c o n d o m s , which
still hardly ever make an appear-
ance on the big screen.
Although I have lived my entire
life in the shadow of the work of
Freud, it is possible to imagine a
world before w e were exposed to
his particular brand of enlighten-
ment. I reckon lots of people didn't
even know where to stick it back
then. Again, strange as this retro
a n d sex-ignorant society might
appear, I a m sure that many cou-
ples achieve a lot of pleasure
through the experience of sexual
discovery, rather than having it all
presented to t h e m in the clinical,
soulless jargon of the psychologist.
As I sit here clamouring for
another hundred words' worth of
ideas f r o m m y journalistic col-
leagues, o n e cry goes up: "Sex is
overrated!" Pessimistic 1 may be,
but one only has to look at the
hordes of couples w h o have been
married for thirty years or more to
see the silver lining. Let m e finish,
then, with a tacky epigram of my
o w n : sex is like opening a bank
vault. Y o u don't need dynamite,
y o u just n e e d the right
combination.
