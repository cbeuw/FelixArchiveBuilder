Felix Presents
T h e G r e a t A n n u a l
Environmentally Unfriendly
Easter
The Simpsons
Price: £2.49
Description: Y o u r run-of-the-mill
TV-endorsed additive-ridden over-
packaged pseudo-egg. But hey, it's
got the Simpsons on it.
Comments: Utterly tasteless - can it
really be made of chocolate, or have
w e got it mixed up with the packag-
ing? Would rate worse that Winnie
the Pooh if it weren't for the gener-
ous handful of jellybeans. Comes
with a free 'Don't forget the
Simpsons' T V Times page marker
that must be worth all of two pee.
The Verdict: Better than a kick in
the head. * * V2

Winnie the Pooh
Jelly Tots
Price: 99p
Description: Buying this for anyone
over three years old would be an
insult.
Comments: A really feeble effort.
The poor-quality chocolate tastes of
washing-up liquid and the derisory
quantity of Jelly Tots provided would-
n't satisfy a pigeon. Pretty cheap,
though. Perhaps suitable for some-
one you don't really like anymore,
but that society dictates must be pre-
sented with a symbolic piece of ovoid
confectionary.
The Verdict: Tastes like Winnie's
pooh. V2
Cadbury's
Buttons
Price: £1.29
Description: So small it barely quali-
fies as an egg at all.
Comments: Initial reactions were
poor, with the diminutive packaging
only compounding the rubbery tex-
ture of the low-cocoa chocolate.
There was some debate over the
aftertaste - milky or soapy? The
cheeky pocket-sized packet of
Buttons will cheer up the most dismal
of days.
The Verdict: It's not something that
you would eat for pleasure. * Ht
Terry's Chocolate
Orange
Price: £2.99
Description: N o t an egg at all, but
more like a reddish-coloured sphere
of cocoa. T o put it another way, it's
a chocolate orange.
Comments: O n opening the box,
our investigator was deeply disap-
pointed to find nothing but air. O n
closer inspection, an 'egg' was dis-
covered at the bottom, hiding
behind a molecule. Smooth, rich
chocolate was munched aside to
reveal a treasure of bite-sized citrus
blobs. Most satisfactory.
The Verdict: A n egg for life, not just
for Easter. * # # *
