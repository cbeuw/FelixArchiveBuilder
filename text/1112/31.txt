C L U B S C E N E - C O M P I L A T I O N S
ESSENTIAL OLD SKOOL HARDCORE
MIXED BY DONAVON "BAD BOY" SMITH (DC1)
B
efore D 8 3 , before jungle
there was the original hard-
core s o u n d . A s house went
acidic in the late 80's a new strain
of dance music was born using hip-
hop breakbeats as it's heart. It was
heavier, harder and faster than any-
thing before. It was the soundtrack
to the rave scene across the UK.
Donavon "Bad Boy" Smith, one
of the original DJs and producers,
has expertly mixed together 24 true
original hardcore classics as only
s o m e o n e with his experience
could. I have always liked the Bad
Boy's mixing and this is no disap-
pointment. It brought back so
many memories of times 1 doubt I'll
see again.
This double C D pack is just
ram-jam-packed full of so so many
groundbreaking pieces of work it's
hard to believe. There's even some
in here that I don't recognize.
Dance Conspiracy's-Dui) War
gets us underway with that serious
sub-bass and beautiful breakdown
closely f o l l o w e d by Zero B's
Lockup - not the mix that's normal-
ly played, so it's nice to see the
Bad Boy staying away from the
obvious choices. A s there are so
many other great tunes from this
era.
Two tracks from the superb
Rhythm 4 Reason are featured here
and as with many of these tunes
it's not only the shit hot use of
drum patterns, a whole array of dif-
ferent b-lines and clever samples,
but the astoundingly deep break-
downs. It's amazing h o w they stir
up such strong emotions; they still
send a shiver d o w n my spine.
The first time 1 listened to this,
I kept thinking "I hope this tracks
on there" and then it would c o m e
on. Believe me, they're all on here
and then some. A really compre-
hensive review of the 9 2 - 9 4 rave
scene.
At this point 1 must c o m e back
to the mixing - which is second to
none. If y o u don't know these
tracks inside out it can all go pear
shaped very easily. This is a time
before the music was so styled and
separated. A time when y o u could
still play what resembles D&J5,
Jungle, Breakbeat, H a p p y Hardcore
(4 beat) and Techno alongside
each other.
The Bad Boy knows exactly
when to put the mixes in and when
to take them out. There are a few
hairy m o m e n t s , but y o u ' d only
notice t h e m if y o u listen extremely
closely, and it's always suitable
resolved. O n e of the best tunes on
here is the Bad Boy's very o w n
track Obsession - one of my
favorite tunes of all time.
So if, like me, y o u grew up in
the rave culture this is an absolute
must. I promise y o u will not be dis-
appointed. For the uninitiated this
is your chance to hear what y o u
missed and find out what ali the
fuss is about.

D R U M * N * B A S S
ADR Feat. Brown Girl. Burning
(Deconstruction) Out Now.
V.l.P dub is the pick of the bunch
and the one your probably hear in
the clubs. Starts out with nicely
chopped up beats and a siren n'
acid influences. The powerful bass
drum sets the pace, l o o p e d title
vocal that y o u all should know by
now and gun shoots take y o u to
the break. In drops the heavy duty
sub-bass &. strong old skool influ-
ences, sounds slightly dated but I
like it and it's well m a d e .
Rugged and Tough. The Sound /
Got to Get (Confetti Rec) March.
This is a track with silky s m o o t h
production skills, a very full &. d e e p
sound, slow beats, dark intrusive
sub-bass, haunting keys that fits
together tightly with a stunning
female vocal that should complete
the track perfectly, but this is
where it all goes wrong, as the
lyrics ruin it for me " This is the
sound I love, w h e n I'm rocking in
the rave with the massive 'n' crew"
But then again I'm particularly
picky about things like that.
Circo Castelli. Roadblock
(S.I Projects) 30 March.
The best way to describe this is as
a jazz-house fusion, with a distinc-
tive piano cx snare intro, then
comes in a double bass sounding
b-line and a fast t e m p o bass drum
this all works well together. But
the piano comes in too strong and
for too long. Apart from that the
track is O K - a g o o d idea that
doesn't really work that well. If y o u
like jazz and house then this should
be right up your street.
Goldie. Believe. Groove vocal &
dub mix (Metalheadz) 23 March
No, this isn't a misprint. A garage
tune on M e t a l h e a d z the h o m e of
dark ' n ' hard drum and bass. Very
pleasant female vocal and cool
electro breakbeats make up the
intro, then in roll the stepping
garage beats. All this has a very
original feel, a refreshing change
from most of what you'll find in the
shops. Dub mix toughens up the
beats &. cuts d o w n the vocal. I pre-
fer this mix but it's far to short.
DEA Project. White Label
(Marvel City Rec) Out Now
Another old skool remix but what a
tune to remix a truly awe inspiring
track. It's been given what is being
called the "smooth groove" treat-
ment; not the usual speed garage
mix that most tunes get. This gives
it a slight edge on the hoard of old
skool remixes out at the moment.
Flip-side has s o m e two step busi-
ness going on with pleasant female
vocals, but it doesn't d o m u c h else
but that's why we mix.
Look out for Flex Kru's, Watch
the Flex (issue 1108) as it's get-
ting a full release on 23rd March.
Their ruff remix of Robbie
Williams latest tune is also due
for immanent release. Jo Public.
Addiction/Carlito.Future Elements
(Creative Source) Mid March.
Strong hi-hat and percussion intro
s o o n joined by a double-bass
sounding tone, piercing keys and a
squealing trumpet takes y o u to the
break. Fast stepping beats soon
take control cv soft touches of jazz
- not too much, nice &. s m o o t h for
the mix. O n e for the stepping and
jacking masses. Hey, hey. Flip-side
has tougher beats and stronger
atmosphericals in a jazzy style, and
those melodic keys give it a more
intelligent feel.
The Prisoners Of Technology.
Crazy/Cold Blooded (Fresh Kutts)
23 March.
Another strong release from the
P.O.T boys, and this ones right up
there with their previous releases,
which is no mean feat. Crazy is a
dark jump-up sort of tune with a
fresh rinsing b-line, but the one
that's been making all the noise is
Cold Blooded. It has a fuller sound,
more complete, building beats with
nice little cut backs and an a c c o m -
panying bell tone. Sirens and title
vocals take y o u to the break then
watch out for yet another phat fil-
tered b-line. I can't wait for the
next one.
Artemis. Inner World / Sun Stars
(Goodlooking Rec.) 6th April.
In that traditional G L style, mean-
dering string intro punctuated with
acoustic guitar and shortly followed
by those rolling breakbeats, high
frequency chimes and an unintru-
sive b-line. Sun Stars is more of the
s a m e ; d e e p ' n ' rolling breaks
dreamy atmosphericals and careful
Eqing give it a panoramic feel. Are
you ready for a journey deep into
the sub-conscious?,This one's sure
to keep GL fans more than happy.
Scorpio. Trouble
(V Rec.) Out Now.
This is fast becoming a label like
M e t a l h e a d z &. G o o g looking, where
you can buy every release and
y o u ' r e almost guaranteed it's
gonna be w i c k e d . They've done it
again, with another s t o r m i n g
release from V records. I didn't
think they could match Warhead
but they keep doing it - metallic
echoing bass drum and, when it
drops in, watch out for those seri-
ous stepping beats and a variation
of that a w e s o m e bassline.
Moving Fusion. Turbulence
(Ram Rec) Out Now.
This is a limited edition sampler
from the forth c o m i n g Sound In
Motion album that is set to blow up
like C h e r n o b y l , a n d is d u e for
release mid-April. M y local shop
sold 25 copies of this single on the
first day it was released. A totally
ruff tune and check the bole bole
bassline, that's been tearing up all
the right clubs around the country.
It's even getting quite regular plays
on the radio. Enough said. JP
