Residents of Bernard Sunley
House in Evelyn Gardens have
been hit by spate of mystery
thefts, including four robberies
in the last week alone.
P r o b l e m s started last term
w h e n a student had a laptop c o m -
puter stolen from a locked r o o m
during renovation work. The inci-
dents of theft have increased since
then a n d items s w i p e d include a
walkman, a playstation, a cash box
and around Â£ 1 0 0 0 worth of photo-
graphic equipment. Property has
also disappeared from the war-
den's a n d subwarden's flats. A l l
the rooms are thought t o have
been locked, a n d there were n o
signs of forced entry. Richard
D a s h w o o d , the warden of the hall,
explained that "I can't think of any
incidents at Bernard Sunley this
year or the year before, but n o w
there's a sudden increase a n d I
want t o see s o m e action taken to
rectify the situation... It's a mys-
tery w h y it's happening, no master
keys are missing."
Concern has also been raised
over the level of security cover for
Evelyn Gardens, after the security
lodge was closed for financial rea-
sons last year. Ken Weir, IC's Chief
Security Officer, denied that this
was a factor; " N o t for o n e minute
w o u l d it have made any differ-
ence", he argued, adding that the
layout of the halls m a d e standard
security patrols ineffective. "The
thieves can simply target the build-
ing that the security officer has just
left." M r D a s h w o o d d i s a g r e e d ,

[security] man o n site does act as
a deterrent". H e w e n t o n t o

Felix has been cast into disarray
and anarchy following the shock
arrest of its editor Mr Jeremy
Thomson. Police entered the
newspaper's office in the North
West corner of Beit Q u a d late o n
M o n d a y evening a n d found M r
T h o m s o n at his
desk. To the
amazement of the
assembled student
journalists, he w a s
detained a n d
charged with the
supply of large
quantities of
Lysergic A c i d
D i e t h y l a m i d e
(LSD), a class A
drug.
T h o m s o n is A cross marks the spot; the
believed to have alleged location of the drug dot
personally placed a
second staple head. Editor elect,
M r Edward Sexton took control of
the publication following an emer-
gency meeting with ICU represen-
tatives. It later emerged that M r
Sexton himself may be implicated
in the stunt, having admitted that
he stole a Gilson pipette from the
Biology department for Thomson
last week. "It was a
favour for a friend, I
had no idea that it
would be used for
illegal purposes",
explained M r
Sexton. A n d y
Thompson, manag-
er of the ICU Print
Unit, told Felix that
"It's absolutely
nothing to d o with
me."
It is not known
what motivated the
editor to engineer
the police are n o w co-operating to
investigate the crimes.
The investigators currently
have very little evidence to work
on, although the police are thought
to have been examining finger-
prints in the area. Meanwhile, stu-
dents in the hall are becoming
increasingly w o r r i e d about
strangers having access t o their
rooms, with o n e resident seriously
considering leaving. "The place I'm
living is dingy, small, has poor
security and generally sucks", Felix
was told.
Anyone noticing any suspicious
person is encouraged t o make a
detailed description a n d inform
security o n 5 8 9 0 0 . If a confronta-
tion occurs, or if a thief is actually
caught in the act, call 9 9 9 and then
alert security.
