a particular person or r o o m turning up, is
useful.
If you wake up directly from a dream, y o u
are likely to remember it well. The trick is
not to move or o p e n your eyes, but to
immediately rerun the dream in your head
before writing it d o w n . Concentrate partic-
ularly on any dialogue, as this will be for-
gotten by the morning. If y o u can't face
writing m u c h at 3am, summarise as best
you can and fill in the detail in the morn-
ing.
last thing to pass though your mind as you
slip into unconsciousness. To compliment
this technique, try writing out a contract
with yourself, signing it and leaving it by
your bed.
Another useful tool in recognising dreams
in the dreamsign - something that you can
observe or a test you can perform to con-
firm whether you are dreaming or not. The
key to this method is to routinely look out
for the signs and perform the tests during
waking hours, so that they become sec-
ond-nature. The box opposite shows some
c o m m o n l y used dreamsigns, but y o u
should try to invent your o w n .
Next, y o u need to re-enforce your inten-
tion of having a lucid dream. W h e n you
wake from a dream, try to imagine how it
would have been if y o u had become lucid.
Visualise the point at which you w o u l d
have spotted, for instance by recognising
one of your dreamsigns, that you were
asleep. Tell yourself 'I'm in a dream', and
imagine how it could be directed in a way
you desire, such suddenly gaining the abil-
ity to fly.

Here are a few tests you can perform and
Hies to look out for that indicate that yQfik
are dreaming. Whenever something odd
•fepens, whether you think you are asle«p:
or not, perform one or more of these teM|
so that they become habitual.
If you are wearing a watch, take a look a t f l p
Are the hands moving around smoothly?
Can you read the numbers? Try to use y a B
mind to stop the watch, or if it is d i g i t a l , * !
•flange the numbers on it.
It is also a g o o d idea to read through your
dream journal before falling asleep each
night, with the firm conviction that y o u will
wake directly f r o m your d r e a m s a n d
remember them well. If y o u are still unable
to wake during the night or remember
anything in the morning, it may be neces-
sary to use an alarm clock. This is best set
for 6 or 7.5 hours after y o u fall asleep,
with the aim of coinciding with the end of
one of the extended R E M periods. Before
long, y o u will probably be able to recall
several dreams each night. This is an
interesting and revealing experience in
itself, and indicates that y o u are ready to
move on to the second stage of the
course: focusing o n your intent to
become aware in your dreams.
The aim now is to be able to recognise
when y o u are in dream sequence. While it
may sound easy, remember that however
absurd a dream might be, at the time it is
the dreamer's reality, and they are unlike-
ly to doubt it. After all, h o w many times
d o y o u seriously consider that y o u might
actually be dreaming during the day?
This simplest way to achieve awareness is
to tell yourself, as y o u drift off to sleep
that "Next time I'm dreaming, I'm going
to realise it." Try to feel as if y o u really
mean it, and if possible it should be the
The final stage of the technique is perhaps
the hardest; repeating the above stages
until your intention to have a lucid dream is
set. While y o u fall asleep, continuously
remind yourself of your plans. If your mind
starts to wander to other things, start
again. Remember, the aim here is to make
sure you focus on having a lucid dream
right up to the point of sleep.

square law rarely applies and y o u m i J j j l
float d o w n gently or even stay in the air For

Try to remember the chain of events that
led to the current situation. In a dream, y o u
are unlikely to be able to go very far.
Look out for events that y o u consider
impossible, such as meeting dead people,
objects suddenly changing into other
objects or the dream being set in an
impossible location.
^motions may be particularly powerfulBB
unusual in a dream, particularly sexagf
arousal.
If you're not successful immediately, don't
get frustrated. The time the method takes
to work varied from person to person. If
you're getting fed-up with getting no
results, then take a week or two off (though

The Lucidity Institute, w w w . l u c i d i t y . c o m , is
home to a wealth of information and
research data on the subject. They publish
a journal, Nightlight, and offer the chance
to contribute to the research yourself. The
also sell various devices intended to
induce lucid dreaming.
Other w e b resources include a g o o d
overview at w w w . s t u d . u n i -
hannover.de/user/73853/ and a 'layman's
guide' at home.earthlink.net/~izone/lucid/
. For a more amusing take on the subject,

Another interesting site is Lifetools at
w w w . l i f e t o o l s . c o m / novadreamer/-
novadrem.htm, which sells various elec-
tronic aides to lucid dreaming.
Probably the best book on the subject is
Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge. Also
worth a look are Lucid Dreaming by
Patricia Garfield (the text that inspired
LaBerge to begin his research), and The
Bride of Dreams by Van Eeden, in which
he presented his ideas and findings in a
fictional style. Van Eeden's other major
work, A Study of Dreams is available on-
line at www.phoenix.net/~blake.
