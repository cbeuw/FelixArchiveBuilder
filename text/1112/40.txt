GAMING NEWS AND PREVIEWS
South Park is coming
The controversial cartoon s h o w
South Park is to b e c o m e a video
game. Acclaim have secured the
license to develop a g a m e for the
PC and PlayStaion featuring the
show's characters.
The cartoon caused a storm of
protest w h e n launched in the
states, as it features a group of
young kids w h o haven't heard of
policial correctness a n d so merci-
lessley insult each other
constantly. The s h o w itself will be
on Sky this easter, a n d o n terres-
trial TV later this year. The game
isn't scheduled to hit shelves until
1999.
Lara Croft in the flesh
The dream of all s a d , loney T o m b
Raider addicts is to meet Lara Croft
in the flesh. All of y o u will be glad
to know that this is possible, as
Eidos have appointed french babe
Vanessa D e m o u y to be
the official 'real
Lara'.
Expect to see
her gracing adverts
and magazine near
you soon...
Tomb Raider
movie?
G a m e s based o n
movies are c o m -
m o n , although
movies based
on g a m e s
are normally
fairly p o o r
efforts (Street Fighter in particular
was appalling). However, for the
new T o m b Raider movie the pro-
ducer of Boogie Nights has agreed
to take control. Lawrence G o r d o n
has also worked o n Die Hard a n d
Predator, so action flicks are noth-
ing new to him.
N o news yet on w h o will play
Lara, unfortunately.
Shrinking Street Fighters
C a p c o m certainly haven't finished
milking the Street Fighters games
yet. Pocket Fighters, based on the
SF Puzzle game, features a simpli-
fied control system (only 3
buttons) a n d cutesey graphics.
It remains to be seen whether
the public will be impressed with
yet more derivative SF clones.
Atari remembered
Hasbro n o w has the rights to over
75 classic Atari games, a n d plans
to produce updated version. With
Hasbro's update of Frogger contin-
uing to sell by the truckload, w e
eagerly await n e w versions of
C e n t i p e d e , M i s s i l e C o m m a n d ,
Pong, Breakout, a n d Tempest.
Dune 2 0 0 0
Out 1 st May on PC, £40
An update of the 'father of the
C o m m a n d a n d Conquer genre',
Dune 2 0 0 0 is one of the most
eagerly awaited games this year.
With new 16-bit graphics, translu-
cent smoke a n d explosion lighting
effects, this promises to be a
great-looking game.
O n c e you've completed the 27
included missions, you can take o n
up to eight players via a L A N , or
play h e a d - t o - h e a d over the
Internet.
Chill
Out n o w on PlayStation, £35
From Eidos Interactive, Chill is a
new snowboarding game. It differs
from the usual fare in an important
aspect; The aim is not to win races
but to become the most 'chilled'
boarder o n the slopes.
In practice this means a more
relaxed approach than simply rush-
ing to the next checkpoint, a n d
more importance given to per-
forming stunts a n d tricks.
World League Soccer
Out in May on PC and PlayStation
Released to coincide with the start
of the World C u p , W L S features
over 190 teams from 10 different
leagues, coveing all major soccer
worldwide.
A n e w 'skeletal' system of ani-
mation provides fluid motion, a n d
the gameplay promises to recreate
the real 'flow' of a football game.
With commentary from Channel
4's Peter Brackley and Ray Wilkins,
this is a serious contender for the
footy g a m e crown.
Star Trek: Secret of Vulcan
Fury
Although Interplay have already
released t w o Trek-based point and
click adventures, this one should
be different. For a start all the
graphics are lovingly rendered and
look stunningly like the TV series.
A vastly improved plot written
by the show's original scriptwriters
should hopefully lift it above previ-
ous efforts.
Prey
Think you've seen all the Quake
clones y o u can stand? Then get
ready for Prey. 3 D Realms claim
that it will be "at least t w o steps
ahead" of everything else on the
market.
The key to this is the somewhat
unique approach to reality taken by
the designers, with rooms being
larger o n the inside than out, and
gravity changing sides occasion-
ally.
R E V I E W S
STAR WARS: MASTERS OF TERAS ICASI
PlayStation •
A Star Wars beat-em-up from
Lucas Arts? Bound to be a sure-fire
winner w e cried. Unfortunately, w e
then took the game out of it's case,
inserted it into the blessed
Playstation and were deeply unim-
pressed with the result.
What y o u get is a fairly slow,
unimpressive b e a t - e m - u p , with
Han, Luke, Leia et al shamelessly
pasted in. The only nice touch
c o m e s from the neat backgrounds
representing the worlds of the Star
Wars universe. At-at's c l o m p
around Hoth, swamp-things and
Yoda's hut l o o m out of the dark-
ness o n Dagoba - you get the idea.
Yet it's in the gameplay that the
game really lets you d o w n . All the
characters have only a couple of
special moves (which are suspi-
ciously similar for several of them),
and try as hard as I might, I could
never get the blasters/crossbows to
work. For almost all the characters,
it basically descends into the tradi-
tional frenzy of button bashing that
I thought w e ' d finally seen the back
of.
The only exception c o m e s
with Luke. After about ten min-
utes of play it became obvious
that by far the easiest way to win
is to play as Luke, w i p out your
lightsaber and slash the opposi-
tion to pieces - so m u c h so that
in two-player m o d e w e had to
ration out h o w many times w e
got to play the saintly one.
Lucas Arts - please stick to X-
W i n g a n d the like, a n d stop
following the path of the "shame-
less cash in". C o m e back Tekken,
all is forgiven
