istance Records is a French
record label that has really
m a d e it into the forefront of
house a n d techno in recent years.
Concentrating mainly o n straight
house and techno beats, this c o m -
pany has proved itself as a truly
international collective, combining
and releasing talent from all corners
of the electronic globe. Look out
for a forthcoming feature o n t h e
label soon. Until then w e have this
album to listen t o . This is the first in
a series of albums t o s h o w us that
Laurent Gamier is n o t t h e only
French D| that w e should be listen-
ing to!
Jerome Pacman originates from
the capital of France. W e normally
asociate our French cousins with
everything that is artistic, s m o o t h
and passionate. This mix is a testa-
ment t o that french "Je n e sais
q u o i " that m a k e s t h e m s o
amouress a n d r o m a n t i c in o u r
eyes. Fourteen tracks that don't
actually originate from France have
been b l e n d e d a n d crafted i n
Jerome's o w n unique style. M o s t
people ask the question, "DJing, art
or arse?". Here's a DJ w h o ' s truly
putting the art back into club cul-
ture.
This C D has rarely left m y play-
er over the last t w o weeks. It has
everything; funk, pasion, plenty of
sex appeal, d e p t h a n d a real
groove. T h e music chosen from
Jerome follows a strictly housey
flavour. But we're not talking about
your local Ritzy Club house. This is
cutting-edge music from some of
the best producers that exist in the
scene today. Y o u w o n ' t find end-
less breakdowns and " O o o o h ! Take
me higher!" vocals. Quite frankly,
there's enough of that about today.
We're talking about music that is as
comfortable in your C D player at
h o m e , as in a n y superclub.
Personally speaking, any music that
can work in different environments
is music that has been produced
from the heart and is driven by pas-
sion, not economics.
W e begin with a recent track
from t h e m a n of t h e m o m e n t ,
Kevin Yost. His work o n the U S A
label i ! records is highly collectable.
The piece included o n French
Sessions is a beautifully produced
piece o f slick early-morning
house/jazz. Check o u t the saxa-
phone solo. W e follow straight into
a minimal yet rhythmic track from
the Glasgow Underground collec-
tive. Bongo drums skirt in a n d out
of a funky bass guitar riff. Glasgow
Underground are not the most con-
sistent musical outlet at t h e
moment, but I have t o say that this
has real soul.
The m i x soon moves o n a n d
gets more funky. The last few years
have seen house music turn back to
the o l d days of disco for inspira-
tion. This "disco-house" phenome-
na has seen artists such as Johnny
Fiasco, Paul Johnson, Roy Davis Jr.
and Gene Farris. This album con-
tains work from possibly the most
famous disco-groover of them all,
DJ Sneak. Sneak has become a
modern-day house legend. A s a DJ
or producer his work is unmistak-
able and essential. You can listen t o
"Wanna Sing". The disco groove is
maintained with fine tracks from
Rick W a d e (Player's Theme) a n d
M i k e Huckaby (Groove Box).

Jerome is really taking us o n a
journey here. The trip continues
with some quirky music that falls
s o m e w h e r e i n t h e grey area
between house a n d techno. The
excellent M a a s from Scotland's
S o m a Records outs in a n appear-
ance with h i s track A n o t h e r
Saturday Night. S o m a have been
producing funky electronic music
that defies the relentless pigeon-
holing of recent times for many
years and M a a s is o n e of their star
signings. Paris Angeles gets a cred-
it with a track called Hardgroove, a
track that really pushes things t o an
extreme. I had never c o m e across
Paris' work previously, but this
track serves as an excellent taster
for a talented artist.This review has
covered a fraction of the fourteen
tracks o n offer here. The main thing
to take note of is that the DJ keeps
control of his records throughout

and not vice-versa. In the age of
mega-star DJs acting as little more
than publicity a n d p r o m o t i o n a l
vehicles for a handfull of tracks
from big independant labels, it's
refreshing t o s e e a m i x of tracks
from the underdog, the small-time
producer w h o thinks big musically,
not financially.
Let's not forget, that the star of
this album is Jerome himself. His
mixing is s m o o t h a n d controlled.
His flair a n d passion for his art is
evident. H i s love of the tracks he
chooses a n d combines is obvious.
L o n g g o n e a r e t h e days w h e n
French music w a s laughed at and
ridiculed. St Germain, Daft Punk,
Etienne d e Crecy and Air have led a
new French revolution. N o w DJs
like Jerome Pacman are teaching us
how t o play t h e house music w e
love. Vive L a France; Vive La
M u s i q u e ; Vive La H o u s e ! ai.ck
