The dream world, while we are in it, is just
as logical and genuine as what w e jokingly
call reality. Whether it is G o d or physics at
the controls, the world is an immense
mechanism of the possible and the likely in
which play a tiny part. W e have only a min-
imal, physical influence o n our surround-
ings. Yet everybody harbors secret wishes
of the impossible; to travel in time; to
make love to the most desirable partners
imaginable; to be the world's greatest gui-
tarist; to move out of their body; or to fly
at will. W h e n we are awake, such things
are impossible. W h e n we are asleep, they
called lucid dreaming.
it. If left to chance, such events are rare
and lack clarity. Fortunately, it is possible to
learn how to achieve a lucid state regularly
and to use the awareness to increase your
control over the dream
While public knowledge of lucid dreaming
is only recently becoming widespread, it is
far from being a new discovery. A s early as
the eighth century the subject received
extensive study by Tibetan Yogis w h o
claimed to have almost total control over
their dreams. However, the first modern
figure to examine the phenomenon was the
Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys, a dedi-
cated researcher w h o recorded his o w n
dreams from the age of thirteen. In his first
y o u n g researcher - StephefBtaBerge - to
set the discovery on a scientific founda-
tion. His book, Lucid Dreaming is the
definitive work on the subject;; His research
continues to this day via;? the Lucidity
Institute, an organisation he founded to
promote research and interest in lucid
dreaming.
Stephen LaBerge has also invented a
method of training to help people achieve
and use lucidity, known as the M I L D tech-
nique. This method has been used to great
success, with a few students becoming
lucid on the first attempt. Usually it will
take several weeks or pdssibly months to
learn and, as they say, a lifetime to master.
Have confidence in the techniques, and be
persistent, and the potential rewards are
unlimited.
Lucid dreaming is the ability to become
conscious or 'awake' while in a dream,
and thus becoming able to take control
not only of your actions, but of your sur-
roundings. All of the 'impossibilities'
above are easily achieved and more - the
only limit being y o u r imagination.
Remember also that events and feeling
experienced while dreaming are at least
as convincing and real as those in waking
life and it b e c o m e s difficult to see why
you would ever want to be awake. A
dream is no longer a place where y o u are
a helpless victim, but a place to dismiss
the cares and concerns of waking life and
do exactly what you like.
The key to lucid dreaming is becoming
aware, while y o u are asleep, that you are
experiencing a dream. M o s t people will
be able to recall dreams where this has
happened, and may have even used the
awareness to direct the dream, perhaps
by facing a nightmare situation to defeat
Events and feeling experi-

This first step in the M I L D technique is
improving dream recall. Usually, dreams
are largely or totally forgotten by the
dreamer unless they are awoken while a
dream is still in progress. This selective
amnesia probably e v o l v e d to prevent
dreams interfering with man's understand-
ing of waking life. However, it is both pos-
sible and interesting to learn to recall your
dreams.
book, Dreams and How to Guide Them
(1867), he outlined the methods by which
he was able to recall dreams, become
aware of them and ultimately to control
them. This work was picked up this centu-
ry by a Dutch psychiatrist Van Eeden, w h o
published the remarkable paper, A Study of
Dreams, which coined the n a m e lucid
dreaming. It can be read in full at

The next major in dream study was a scien-
tific one - from around 1952 it became pos-
sible to electronically measure brain activity.
Several excellent works were published (see

A n important part of dream recall is get-
ting a g o o d night's sleep. This allows you
to focus better on the dreams and leaves
time to record them while still getting suf-
ficient rest. Furthermore, the R E M periods
in which dreams occur b e c o m e both more
regular and more prolonged during the
night. You will also need a notebook and
pen for recording recollections. Initially,
you should write d o w n everything you
remember about a dream, no matter how
bizarre or fragmented it is whenever you
wake up. Even vague information, such as
