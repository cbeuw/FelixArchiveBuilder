T H A B O M B I
The last week of term and we look at what's happening down at KISS FM.
What's up! Last week of term and people out
there just chillin', well y'all can stop chillin' and
start reading cause I got a page load of stuff for
ya. This weeks Phat Selection is an Essential
Selection, a compilation of the best from the
past couple of months. The rest is the usual shit,
news and reviews.
What the hell is happening d o w n at Kiss F M ,
they have gone from getting the best of the
underground DJs and promoting them, t o simply
signing high profile figureheads. Obviously I a m
talking about the Dani Behr situation. Dani has
been signed t o do her o w n weekday radio show
from 4 til 8, although she has no previous radio
experience. She's been put together with t w o
other current presenters, Janice V e e a n d
Lorraine A s h d o w n . So far the show's not been
all that bad, but the long primetime slot has
meant pushing back the specalist shows a n d
only time will tell if this leads t o a lack of real
quality R&£ on Kiss. I hope not but I got a funny
feeling.
At last, the huge Destiny's Child No, No, No
gets a UK release. What's the problem with
record companies over here? Huge floor fillers
like Destiny's Child don't get a UK release for
time, why? It's s o simple, it's all about the
money. Releasing o n import means the track
can build up s o m e hype, DJs be playing it, peeps
hear it, they want it, but it costs (you know £ 6
to £7 o n import); so when it eventually gets a
UK release its gonna g o thru' the roof. The
best example is the Usher g e m You A/lake....'
released o n import in September. People were
lovin' this, and when it g o t its U K release in
January, w e all know what happened, it flew
straight to the top spot.
At the s a m e time
imports are the shit,
cause there are so many
tracks that are the defin-
ition of phatness that
never get a UK release.
From the end of last year
we had M Q 3 ' s Everyday,
which w a s doing d a m -
age o n the floors, but
never g o t the airplay or
the hype and I ended up
parting ways with a fiver
for it. There are loads of
tunes like that, y o u
hear'em, hunt'em down,
but they're only there on
import. A s long as
there's m o n e y t o be
made, we gonna have to
live with it.
O n the album front
two more compilation
albums (yeah more fuck-
ing compilation albums)
have been released, but
these are not the usual
shit; for once w e have
two w i c k e d examples.
First u p there is the
Mastercuts Classic R&B.
I k n o w what you're
thinking, this has been done before, but surpris-
ingly not. Mastercuts have probably done every
other muscial form including swing, hip hop and
even jazz-hop but not R&B; the album is
described as a collection of classic R&J3 cuts
from the ages, and this is packed full of dope
tunes. The club classic Only You by 1 12 and
Biggie is included, Faith Evans' / Just Can't Wait
from the High School High Soundtrack and of
course a track from the boys Jodeci Cef on Up.
As well as more from Blackstreet, D'Angelo, Toni
Braxton and Brian McKnight, this album is class
but there is a downside cause included on this is
a M a s e track, and this track ain't classic R&J5.
The second compilation set is Kiss F M ' s Smooth
Grooves '98 double album. A collection of the
best tunes from the past year, it's all g o o d here.
The range of tracks o n this is very impressive,
mixing up the best from hiphop and R8J3, with
LLCool J's Phenomenon, Busta's smash Put Your
Hands..., the huge club hit from Biggie
Hyptonize, my favourite Wishing on A Star from
Jay Z, the killer You Know My Steez by Gangstarr
(Nim!) as well as Rakim, M i s s y and many more;
on an R&J5 tip it's equally strong with Lynden's
Sexy Cinderalla, Say Nothin' by Omar, K-Ci and
Jojo's classic You Bring Me Up, the d o p e Brian
McKnight You Should Be Mine and more from
Allure, En Vogue, M a r y J. and Joe. You probably
got most of these but if y o u ain't, this is quality.
Still on the album tip, there's lots t o look out
for in the next f e w months. Aretha Franklin's
album A Rose is Still A Rose is due out at the end
of April, the single (check the Phat Selection) is
also due for a U K release at the same time.The
Gangstarr album has been put further back t o
April according to producer DJ Premier, probably
due t o trouble in clearing K-Ci Jo-Jo for the
song Royalty. Work is o u t o n the Caught U p
soundtrack and may be their dopest yet. Both
tracks are d o i n g the business a n d show
Gangstarr are maintaining the skillz. They aren't
the only old school hip hoppers to be dropping
an album, Public Enemy are currently hard at
work in the studio o n their Resurrection.
Smooth's new album Reality is out now; she has
changed not only her record c o m p a n y but also
her style, rapping less and singing more and is
different to the usual R&Ji including a track more
suited to Alanis Morrissette!
Milen &. Roni
Phat Selection
Royalty - Gangstarr feat. K-Ci and Jojo
Gangstarr are hip hop and, with the original
swing boys K-Ci Jojo, they have produced a
track that is making all the right noises.
Deja Vu (Uptown Baby) - Lord Tariq & Peter
Gunz
Monster! This is getting heavy rotation on the
radio, cause this is a killer. A n ode t o their
home, the Bronx, from t w o underground rap-
pers.
You Make Me Wanna - Usher
After blowing up on import back in the autumn
You Make... got its UK release and went
straight t o number one, you wanna y o u
gotta.
No, No, No (Wyclef Remix) - Destiny's Child
The four girls from Texas together with the
Fugee's Wyclef bring us a phat piece of head
nod. The hook is so simple even the rock boys
can sing along.
Do I Qualify - Lynden David Hall
The second cut from Lynden's acclaimed
album 'Medicine 4 M y Pain' this is pure soul,
sung by a man with real soul.
Weekend - Dave Hollister feat. Redman and
trick Sermon
I've said this time and time again that this is
phatness itself, killer hook, y o u can't help
singing along t o this.
A Rose is Still A Rose - Arthea Franklin
Lauryn Hill
The Q u e e n of Soul shows her class.
