SINGLES
A huge number if singles
grace this page this week.
Read and enjoy...
T
he Warm Jets produce another
sound single with Hurricane. If
you liked the last ones, then get
this. Solid guitaring, singing a n d
chorus, destined for the number 37
position in the charts that they
know so well, probably deserves
higher.
The Sun Beats Down by the High
Llamas is a playful little number,
that I could imagine the Beatles
d o i n g as a B-side t o Yellow
Submarine, just for a laugh. It won't
get any airtime, you'll never hear
from them again, but w h o cares,
it's fun.
The Dawn of the Replicants fea-
ture next with Hogwash farm (the
diesel hands e.p) which is quite
catchy, but definitely not a single.
There's s o m e nice guitaring tunes
and backing singing, but a patchy
chorus.He often repeats 'nothing
more than H o g w a s h ' a n d the only
explanation for the lyrics of this
song is nothing more than hash.
Alabama 3's Ain't Going to Coa is
a re-release or something like that
and not a bad one. It is very easy t o
listen t o , with a lot g o i n g o n
throughout the song, a mouthorgan
solo a n d a very p o p p y b e a t . A
strange Reverend-like speach in the
middle about s o m e ass, but overall
the sound is g o o d .
David H
Y
ou'll like Tina Moore's Nobody
Better if y o u liked Never Gonna
Let You Go - they're almost identi-
cal. S a m e bass, s a m e skipping
beat. Don't bother with this if
you've got her first a n d if y o u
haven't, well, don't bother with this
either. Let's have a bit of variation
next time M s M o o r e .
Cartoon carry o n the trend for
N A S A publicity with Men from
Mars. Soundng like a more mature
version of the prepubescent Crash,
this is definitely worth a look, if not
just for the cool cover.
Lynden David Hall is always soul-
ful, slow and sexy and doesn't dis-
appoint o n Do I Qualify. Either you
like this type of thing or you don't.
So d o what you please.
Derek
A
band called The Smiles? O h
yeah, 1 guess these guys are
smiling in the s a m e w a y that
Morissey is beaming from ear to
ear. T h e w e i r d vocals o n Say
Something d o the impossible by
sounding like both Roy Orbison and
Bruce Springsteen whilst still stay-

Astral Dominoes is sparse, dancey-
trancey stuff from The Chemical
pilot which isn't m u c h different t o
the rest of this type of thing and is
hardly a prime example of the sub-
tle c o m b i n a t i o n of different
beats/sounds/etc.
Moke's Wheel Is Motion isn't b a d
but not really g o o d with nothing in
the punchy riff t o distinguish it.
Vaguely reminiscent of a more indie
Reef, it sounds as if they had o n e
g o o d idea a n d decided to use it
until it died a horrible, messy death.
Martin
A
udioweb's Policeman Skank...
(The Story of My Life) is an
anti-establishment number with the
video shot in a police line up r o o m .
Not as frenetically frantic as
Bankrobber was but definitely in the
s a m e vein as before. H e a v y
Jamaican accent, solid bassline and
a climactic ending t o the rising
paranoia.
E S S E N T I A L C H O O N
Robbie Williams
Let Me Entertain You
The bad boy from Take That has-
n't done too badly for himself and
though this isn't quite as strong
as the previous singles it certainly
ain't b a d . H e can't half sing
either.

A
rab Strap return with Here We
Go Again. A beautifully depress-
i n g S c o t t i s h ballad. Spoken, rather
than sung, in monotone over basic
strings and beats. Definitely would
n o t be out of place i n Trainspotting.
Everything Goes Around The W a f e r
for The Delgados. Deconstructed
indie patched back together with
strings, flutes, and boost in melody.
Unfortunately the singers tend to
whine rather than rock, s o u n d i n g
more like the Scandinavian variety
of indie p o p .
Another band that is jumping o n
the Black Grape / Fun loving
Criminals band wagon is Junkie XL.
Saturday Teenage Kicks is tedious
rap with a dull dance track that
does absolutely nothing for m e .
O n e of the B-sides, 100, is a instru-
mental dance/trip h o p track that
shows Junkie XL's full potential.
How's It Going To Be is a song
about love a n d breaking up of a
relationship courtesy of Third Eye
Blind. It's as heart wrenching as
ing defiantly indie.
Laughing Stock is lo-speed, lo-fi
from Grandaddy, the Californians
whose dictum for band entry is
sporting an Abraham Lincoln beard.
This track, like others they've made
is equally at home being a relaxing
tune t o chill-out to, or a mosher's
delight.
Sick And Beautiful is a joy to listen
to. Artificial Joy Club's female
vocals are - as the song suggests -
both sick a n d beautiful, featuring
the wonderful cry of T need a quick
fix.' The sick/beautiful t h e m e
means that o n one listen you feel
happy but o n another you're left
feeling d o w n c a s t . Strange but
amazing nonetheless.
Ed
T
here is very strong songwriting
on L/7<e You from the tortured
soul of Kristin Hersh. Melancholic
is the w o r d but not to overkill sta-
tus. Nicely acoustic but isn't exact-
ly 'pop'.
Diwifr has a very strange opening.
Melys produce s o m e scary xylo-
phone noises a n d a haunting
female voice. It reminds y o u of
Portishead a bit. The rest of the
track sounds like a Welsh Bjork
singing over a Wannadies track.
Whether this is a g o o d or bad thing
is for y o u to decide.
Monkey Dead by Sunhouse is from
the f o r t h c o m i n g soundtrack of
Twenty Four Seven, a film where
Bob Hoskins trains a bunch of no-
hopers to box a n d in the process
inspire them t o make something of
themselves. Monkey Dead is prob-
ably the track where B o b wanders
d o w n a lonely street doing a bit of
soul-searching a n d faith question-
ing. An atmospheric acoustic blues
number that is both contemplative
and ultimately uplifting.
Dennis
the guitars o n it. The single does
contain the p o p hit Semi-Charmed
Life .though. Not that that makes it
any better.
You are bound to have already
heard Ian Brown's Corpses, the
heavily play listed follow up to My
Star. It's m o o d y , soulful and excel-
lent. C]
Ramzi
