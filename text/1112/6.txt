to try and get something
aSyj like this off the ground
MWC especially here.
The reason for the
lack of any decent dance music
nights is in m y opinion quite simple
M a r k H o m e the marketing a n d
event's manager w h o has overall
control over what events that are
put o n . After a p p r o a c h i n g h i m
myself to enquire about putting on
some nights and it was basically
like talking to a brick wall, all I got
as a response was that he had
loads of people DJs etc of his o w n
that put things o n . A n d from other
people I have spoken to this is a
c o m m o n response. So why is it
then, that for the whole 4 years I
have been here I have not seen any
dance music nights worth going to?
With this location we could have
nights that people would travel to
attend and make this one of the
most happening places in London
and show the musical depth that
this capital has to offer, instead of
more of the same old all the time. 1
know for a fact that we could have
the biggest names of dance music,
DJs, Live PA's etc for very reason-
able prices and the only thing stop-
ping this from happening as far as I
can see is M r H o m e . If I a m wrong
and there is some other reason I
would love to know what it is.
Hopefully this is the beginning
of something new in the way of
putting nights on that represents
what the people of Imperial College
what to hear not what one person
thinks everyone wants to hear.

UNITED COLOURS
Dear Felix,
M r Darshan Arun wrote last
week (Felix 1111) 'I a m Indian and
like many of my black/brown
friends, I'm into black music'. M a y
I suggest he definitely wants to get
out a bit more if he hasn't yet met
any white / yellow (whatever) peo-
ple w h o also listen to 'soul, swing,
hip hop etc'.
Really, is there a need to bring
what colour someone is, into what
music they like?
Yours,
Elaine Kellow. BC III.
LET THEM FIGHT
Let's face it; C&.G and RCS have
had troubles recently. O n e key
problem is lack of interest from the
general student p o p u l a t i o n . In
times like this, we need to create
an enemy for us to rally against,
and the solution is obvious; each
other. In short, RCS and C & C need
to get at each other. The method
(at least to start with) is clear; mas-
cots. The stealing of another C C U ' s
m a s c o t always created a spirit
amongst the students that leads to
a decent group identity, and this
will be the first step in reviving the
C C U s . The only problem is that
C&.G are a bunch of cowards, afraid
to m a k e their m a s c o t s violate.
C o m e on then, you bunch of girls,
let's sort the men from the boys,
etc. etc.

MY FAULT
Dear Lads,
I would just like to take the
opportunity of putting everyone's
mind's at rest.
M y name is Filtrum, I suppose
you could call me a hockey player.
I would like to lift any blame off my
compatriot, Lager lager. Yes, I
admit it. I shat on the carpet,... A n d
I w i p e d my arse with a cushion.
Loving it baby,
To the 3rds,
Tom.
LIVE O N LINE
Dear Jeremy
In view of last week's feature
on M r C and his internet radio sta-
tion, I would like to point out that
IC Radio also broadcasts live
online. This is a new development
this term which can be accessed at
www.su.ic.ac.ulc/pubboard.
Yours sincerely

SILWOOD CYNIC
Dear Sir
IC is to annex W y e College.
"The merger will work in a similar
fashion to the current set-up with
Silwood Park... Andy Heeps and his
two deputies are already making
plans for a visit...there would be
'more life for the students having a
connection with Imperial'"
I hope Andy will make it clear
that after this visit the W y e stu-
dents will never see another union
officer, that the only way they can
purchase new facilities is to order
them five years in advance, and
that College bureaucracy will sap
their will to live.

HOCKEY M O A N
Felix peeps
I play for ICHC 2nds, and we
thrashed Kings 2nds to W I N our
league.
The back page is occupied by
avoiding relegation, almost w o n
and faint hopes of titles.
Why not put glory headlines of
winners on the back page, take
advantage of the times w h e n IC
wins competitions. Even on the
inside page, y o u could quite easily
miss the whole article with huge
bold font size for rugby and skiing.
Why the intense bias? Do y o u know
what its like to play to a limit to win
a competition on the sports field?
It's not a self publicity seeking
thing, we always use our bar names
in such reports. It is a publicity
seeking thing for the club and col-
lege. I a m sure IMRFC would have
preferred a back page effort too for
their four cup victory. W h y is the
editorial on the sports page?
O h well, its near the end of your
reign at Felix, so why care now?
You've all got your CV points and
enough experience to move one
more step up the ladder.
Try putting 6 years into some-
thing y o u really care about and
have you final glorious m o m e n t
squashed by some armchair editing
by someone w h o doen't bother to
watch any of the sport, by some-
one w h o has never w a r m e d up a
single muscle in their life.
Sense the passion n o w sweety?
All sniveling apologies w e l -
come.
By the way, our mens a n d
ladies 1 st teams are playing in their
cup and B U S A plate finals this
Saturday, fancy sending a reporter
along?
Paul Bland, PG2, y o u need a
sense of humour in life don't y o u !
IC NOT SO HOT
Dear Felix
It appears that there is a c o m -
mon m i s c o n c e p t i o n floating
around Imperial. In Felix this week
[issue 1111, M a r c h 13] S i m o n
Baker writes in his column that
Imperial College is one of the lead-
ing universities in Britain. Have you
spotted the problem yet? M a n y
people at Imperial make the same
mistake as M r Baker: in a recent
edition of Felix a letter from the
Summer Ball Committee claimed
that Imperial is one of Britain's
most prestigious universities. You
must have spotted the problem by
now! Yes, contrary to popular
belief. Imperial College is actually a
college N O T a university! I realise
that this c o m e s as a huge shock to
some people but think about it for
a m o m e n t . Imperial is actually a
constituent college of the
University of London. This explains
why Imperial doesn't have the abil-
ity to award degrees: look closely
and y o u will see that your degree
certificates are actually awarded by
the University of London. W h e n
you have the pleasure of attending
that well known event in the Albert
Hall wearing your robes you are
attending a c o m m e m o r a t i o n day
N O T a graduation day. You are not
being presented with a degree but
an associateship of your c o n -
stituent college.
I realise that to many people
this may seem incredibly pedantic
but actually it's quite important.
The powers that be at Imperial
obviously want to become a univer-
sity in their o w n right and this prob-
ably accounts for their policy of
expanding and incorporating other
colleges (Wye being a topical
example) since they probably think
that the bigger they are the more
likely they are to succeed in
b e c o m i n g a university, or Great
Imperial W o r l d Legacy to quote
your editorial. So in future when
you're feeling a bit d o w n about the
fact that Imperial has just taken
control of something else, maybe
the profits of a travel shop or a
small island nation somewhere in
the Pacific, remind yourself that
Imperial College is exactly what it's
called: the biggest prize of all (uni-
versity status) has still not been
achieved: yet!
