The Surveillance No stars
1 must have been asleep the day it
was decreed that noise constitutes
music; otherwise there is no w a y
half of this w o u l d even be c o n s i d -
ered for release. Here are a couple
of examples. Prowler '97 sounds
like the product of a fight between
a C D and a Brillo Pad and Access
Control is a contender for the long
awaited soundtrack release to that
audio-visual masterpiece Pong.
With s o m e of the strangest
sounds I've ever heard and fart
noises aplenty, The Surveillance
has less sophistication than Bambi
on ice. You will probably have
never heard a n y t h i n g like this
before, and really it w o u l d need a
whole new genre created specifi-
cally for it. However, it w o u l d defi-
nitely be more suited to settle
under the broad banner of 'shite',
and never to be heard again.
Judging by the paranoia c o n -
veyed through the album and track
titles, security measures will not
even let y o u get near this one, but
should this be governed by G r o u p
4, just steer well c l e a r . d Derek

TOWNSHEND
Winterland • • • •
Angst-ridden hippy females, aren't
they great? E m m a T o w n s h e n d , the
daughter of Pete ' W h o ? '
Townshend joins a long line of
h i g h - p i t c h e d , d e e p l y d i s t u r b e d
w o m e n and sounds almost indis-
tinguishable to most of t h e m . She
has a lovely voice with a range
from middle C to about an octave
above top C, not always quite in
the right key, but then what's a few
wrong notes between friends? A n d
like |oni Mitchell, she writes and
plays all her o w n stuff. O n s o m e of
her songs, she sounds a lot like Tori
A m o s , on others Janis Joplin, Kate
Bush, a n d s o m e t i m e s , perhaps
alarmingly, Alanis M o r i s s e t t e .
Don't let that put y o u off, though.
This is a fabulous a l b u m , a n d
deserves to be bought by every-
one. I really like it, but I think I
might be unique in that. G r o w your
short, boyish crop out, put s o m e
flowers in your hair and around
your r o o m , buy a grand piano,
wear long, floral pattern skirts, g o
barefoot, paint your toenails with
glitter, and return to the S u m m e r of
Love. See y o u there.El Julia H.

CLAWFINGER
Clawfinger
Swedish death metal rap? -
H m m m m , . . N i c e ! (NOT!). Basically,
read no further if you're scared of
bands like Korn, White Zombie,
B o d y count, the Deftones, et
al even then y o u probably won't
think this lot are that g o o d .
Clawfinger are a strange lot, all in
all, trying to mix the heavy riffing of
Korn with rap, the attitude of Rage
against the M a c h i n e with the
cheesy lyrics used by bands whose
first language isn't English and the
use of Indian music, all as heard on
their recent single Two Sides. I'm
not saying that this is all bad but it's
certainly an acquired taste though
there are s o m e deceptively g o o d
bits in there, especially w h e n y o u
get past the initial few REALLY
heavy songs. Then y o u get to a col-
lection of lighter songs w h i c h ,
whilst still being heavy, have a few
more hooks and better riffs, being
m u c h more controlled and accessi-
ble. There's s o m e g o o d , slinky bass

lines in there and s o m e rather
funky guitar playing if y o u wait a
while but it's still very formulaic at
times. Strangely enough the last
song is a token 'nice', quiet song
which isn't that g o o d and anyone
w h o bought the album isn't going
to bother to listen to anything like
that.
If y o u like this sort of thing then
it may be worth a go but don't go
buying this on a w h i m - it's not
exactly elevator music. 1

SPACE
Tin Planet
Space don't quite fit the 'difficult'
second album cliche. Yes Spiders,
their debut, was excellent. The
blend of styles saw a band emerge
from Liverpool that wasn't merely
another Beatles clone but one that
e x u d e d originality. They m i x e d
Frank Sinatra with dance beats and
a sprinkle of effects and loops to
create a sort of '90s take on
cabaret-pop-dance. C o u p l e d with

the brilliantly strange voice of
T o m m y Scott, they were sure-fire
winners f r o m the w o r d g o .
A c c o r d i n g to the cliche, their sec-
o n d album should have arrived
after a flurry of press speculation
and excitement, only to be panned
by the industry.
Fortunately that's where the
cliche falls apart - Tin Planet is a
fine album. The spikes of originali-
ty haven't even dulled slightly as
they try new things with their music
like it was quickly going out of
fashion; the opener is a Latin affair
with Scott's voice sounding like he
was s o m e leeetle M e x i c a n and the
other end of the spectrum is at the
other end of the album where
techno rears its head. In between
there are absolute gems, the best
of which is the last single, The bal-
lad of Tom Jones, which features
the vocals of Cerys from Catatonia.
Only Space could get away with
something like this. Here is a song
that is about t w o lovers w h o are
about to kill each other but are
s t o p p e d by the s o u n d of T o m
lones' voice. C o o l ! CI Alok
