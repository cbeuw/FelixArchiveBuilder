that really touched on some new ground.
People say that you can't dance to it;
drum and bass is thought of as just dance
music, now he's tipping it into other
areas. The most important one is
4Heroes, they've done some great work,
and what they did with Nu Yorkan Soul,
Black God of the Sun, the remix •
on that was really good. I loved the
Love/ess EP, that's groat. Obviously

Your second album was produced by Delfeayo
Marsalis; they are quite a family, aren't they?
Oh yeah, they are phenomeonal, I mean
with Bran ford doing the Buckshot
LoFonque thing, you've got Stig from the
Jay Leno show, he finally had a hit
record, Wynton doing all his classical
stuff, there's a brother Jason Marsalis
who plays the drums; a good drummer.
And Ellis [the boys' father, responsible for, amongst
other things, the jazz associated with the Snoopy TV
cartoons]...
Oh yeah, Ellis as well. I worked with Ellis
on a record, they are all so talented. I'm
good friends with Bran ford; he and I have
socialised several times Haughsl. He is
very suportive of what we do over here
What are you going to do next? What is next for
jazz?
/ don't know about jazz, but me I'm going
to take it a lot deeper. Deeper and deep-
er. There are certain types of music that I
like, like drum and bass for instance, and
I have to incorporate that to a greater
degree, also the way that we record ear-
lier, I'd like to have the feedback thing like
Adam F and Grooverider, which is what
I'm trying to do with this remix album. I
think that I'll be doing that a lot more. I
want to increase the width of the people
who listen, not just jazz guys who know
Charlie Parker; in fact the guys who
would never listen to jazz.
Who is left for you to record with?
Oh there are so many people, I've never
recorded with Wynton. I would love to do
some recordings with Tricky. I've listened
to Echobelly; I love her voice. I did the
BBC charity thing over Christmas, Perfect
Day, and I was supposed to meet Eternal,
but the lead singer couldn't make it, so I
didn't meet them. Morcheeba! They've
got good flavour. The new Eels record,
that gave me food for thought, and I met
them, and you know what; we were all
listening to the same records; Fun Lovin'
Criminals, Cypress Hill. All these combi-
nations from across the globe, they are all
ending up in England.
I'm actually a jazzer myself; I play alto saxo-
phone. What advice would you give to someone
like me?
Be as open-minded as possible. If you
are an alto player, you have to cover
the ground. If you wanna start now,
you could do David Sanborn, you
know, don't spend too much time on
that. If you wanna be an artist, go into
the 'sixties and do, say, Woody
Cogan. Pick seven songs that these
! guys have done, and just learn them.
Then, go back to the 'fifties; you
could do Charlie Parker, Phil Woods...
That's where I'm sitting, definitely...
... then go back to Johnny Hodges
and even further, y'know; the further you
go back, the easier it will be to do con-
temporary stuff. A lot of guys just con-
centrate on, well, you know David
Sanborn is commercial, people know it so
let's get that sound, and they don't get
the real deal The further you go back the
easier it will be to understand someone
who is contempoary at the moment. Also,
try and learn about other instruments; the
easiest way to do that is to use comput-
er technology. Before, it was, "Oh yeah,
you learn the piano." Y'know, the piano
was the computer; you have to learn
something about harmony, if you're an
instrumentalist. So the piano is essential.
But the computer, now, in this day and
age, is just as important.
How would you like to be remembered?
Ooh, well... that's a difficult one.
Obviously I'd like to change the face of
British jazz. It's really hard to say these
things, they always come out the wrong
way when you read them back! But I
would definitely like to be someone who
is seen as trying to make and improve jazz
music, and speak at this time for our gen-
eration; just in the same way that Charlie
Parker, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald,
Coltrane and Wayne Shorter did.
Y'know, I wanna do the same job.
Courtney Pine was talking with Jonathan Trout.
