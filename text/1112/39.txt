y love affair with Greek
drama started with a pro-
duction of Frogs, which I
saw at a tender age. The immortal
lines have haunted me ever since,
and so I was keen to see this pro-
duction of one of m y favourite
plays. The play is a low c o m e d y
about the roles of poetry a n d
poets, with a biting satirical edge.
Briefly, Dionysis discovers that
THEATRE 39
there are no decent poets about
n o w Aeschylus and Euripides are
dead, and as Patron of Theatre, he
might be out of a job. So, he and
his grumbling slave go d o w n to
Hades to rescue one of the two
geniuses. O n the way, he meets
Heracles and the musical frogs,
w h o sing all day in the marshes and
bogs. Dionysis doesn't like their
singing, and tells them so in a
beautifully poignant speech.
The p r o d u c t i o n at the
Courtyard brings out the physical
humour of the play, and also what I
imagine to be the rhythms of
Ancient Greece. The choruses are
sung, livening up otherwise fairly
dull chunks of speech. The comic
rivalry between Aeschylus a n d
Euripides is wonderfully d o n e ,
bringing out the differance in
rhythm between the two writers.
The director has stuck faithfully to
the costumes of the time, and has-
n't cut any of the political satire.
This is important; the play, like oth-
ers of Aristophanes, has a serious
message about civil war.
G o and see this, it's fun, it's live-
ly, it's entertaining, and I really
enjoyed it.

With only a barren tree and a
rock for company, two tramps ram-
ble around a barren stage, bored,
spending the entire play waiting for
G o d o t . Julian Glover a n d Alan
Dobie throw themselves with gusto
into the tramps' shoes and make a
lively job with the clever script.
They clown about the stage eliciting
some great slapstick moments. 1
found following the endless stream
of subtle witticisms tiring, although
the other theatregoers around me
were chuckling knowledgeably.
The play's success lies in the
depth of the characters' dialogue
and predicament. They strive to
achieve firm conclusions about life,
but every question they ask leads
to an argument, serving only to
raise more questions. Their entire
existence is characterised by a
hideous, inescapable uncertainty.
They are interrupted by the
arrival of P o z z o , a country gentle-
man on the verge of insanity, and
his maltreated servant Lucky. Their
curiously symbiotic relationship
and insane behaviour make the two
tramps s e e m almost n o r m a l .
"Haven't they changed?" one tramp
says referring to P o z z o and Lucky
after they've left,despite never hav-
ing met them before. The first half
of the play ends with the arrival of
a small boy announcing that G o d o t
will not be c o m i n g that day.
The second half is essentially
the same as the first; P o z z o and
Lucky appear again, unable to recall
having met the tramps before. Even
the tramps are not totally certain.
O n c e again the boy comes to tell
them that Godot will not be c o m i n g
that day, but denies meeting them
the day before. The tramps desper-
ately question the boy, their only
link to the outside world, only to be
frustrated as the boy retreats off
stage. Although the boy appears
only twice during the play, it is
understood that in the timeless
world of the tramps, he has been
seen for eternity. As Vivian Mercer
put it: "Waiting for Godot is a play
in which nothing happens, twice"
As an interesting evening of
highbrow wit and profoundity, the
play excels. Seats are fairly expen-
sive, so if y o u prefer a more con-
crete plot, set in the real world then
I w o u l d r e c o m m e n d s o m e t h i n g
else.

BEYOND ECSTASY
The Brix
F
or those of y o u w h o feel that
theatre is for the chords and
jacket wearing middle aged,
it's time your minds were o p e n e d .
There's no need for cannabis,
crack, speed, LSD, or even ecstasy
because Beyond Ecstasy manages
to dispel any pre-conceived ideas
about the theatre and certainly
opens your mind-plus it's c o m -
pletely legal.
There's so m u c h to say about
Beyond Ecstasy that I don't intend
to waste space writing about the
plot, apart from the fact that it's a
love story about a y o u n g prostitute
trying to escape to L o n d o n only to
get drawn into a world of drugs.
Nothing new there, I hear y o u say,
nothing which has not been cov-
ered by the range of new plays in
the past few years looking at simi-
lar aspects of society- Trainspot-
ting or Shopping and Fucking.
Where this play excels is in the
atmosphere that it creates, the way
that the play was put together, the
relationships on stage, and the
audience that it appeals to.
As 1 lingered in the bar before
the performance, I was struck by
the type of people around me. It
was a mass of stylish 20-some-
things, none of w h o m would have
looked out of place in any of the
best clubs or pubs in the capital. A
far cry from the National or the
tourist riddled musicals. What was I
to expect? The auditorium was
alive. The Dj on the decks was mix-
ing a blend of loud fast dance, the
stage teeming with a visual display
of Acid House Cinema and cruising
lights-the play had not yet even
begun. As the lights faded two
dancers a p p e a r e d on and the
action began.
Throughout the performance
the music was c o m i n g from the Dj
mixing it there and then, recreating
the atmosphere of the clubs and
lives we were following. The p o p -
style lighting enhanced the simple
set to allow easy and flowing
changes between scenes from
clubs to sitting rooms to cars to
dream-like states of drug influ-
enced minds. The play does not
only use technical effects to gain
appeal. Beyond Ecstasy was
devised by the c o m p a n y using
structured improvisation around a
story, allowing it to alter a n d
change in three years so it's still rel-
evant, funny and realistic. Conver-
sations are unscripted and true to
life, characters are reflective of
those you see around y o u , and on-
stage relationships are truly touch-
ing. Beyond Ecstasy lives and works
off it's o w n upbringing and forma-
tion.
The first half is amusing, fast
and enthralling, the second grot-
esque, terrible but satisfying. The
plot does not go as far as to advo-
cate the use of drugs, but it cer-
tainly falls short of showing their
downside. But this is not the point.
It is not meant to be an education,
it's a story represented and por-
trayed for y o u t h with emotions
they know and feel. There are plans
to make it into a film, something
that should work if the same spirit
and conviction is carried through.
Beyond Ecstasy is not a night of
polite entertainment, it's a night to
enjoy, relish and live.
