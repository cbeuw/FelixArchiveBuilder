DUST JUNKY9V
Done and...Dusted
H o l d o n I haven't g o t the
wrong C D have I? This sounds dis-
tinctively like the Black Crowes. (It
can't be, but only because I don't
have any Black C r o w e s stuff).
Nothin' Personal, which begins the
album has a funky bass line and
kicks into an aggressive hip hop
rant - a real c r o w d shout along.
What Time Is It? hits y o u next
though a little t o o similar to the
previous track, again with an
extremely similar bassline a n d
s o m e gratuitous scratching thrown
in. H i p h o p styles are abundant
throughout the album, but the
whole sound gets a little samey
after a c o u p l e of listens.
Nevertheless s o m e tracks stand
out, such as the energy rush of
Non Stop Operation with the lead
singer sounding like a harder ver-
sion of Tricky!
Sometimes they c o m e across
as a second rate Rage Against The
M a c h i n e {Here I A m ) a n d it'd be
worth your time to just stick to
your Rage records.
As a live band I reckon they
must be excellent at rousing up the
crowd with their many anthems,
but after a couple y o u ' d be forgiv-
en for thinking they'd stuck a
looped sample of the same t w o
tracks. They've tried to reduce the
m o n o t o n y by sticking in a couple
of ballads, but these are worse
than the 'in yer face' songs.
The Dust Junkys lyrics are
about drugs, fights, w o m e n and
wasting people w h o get in their
way, although y o u always get the
impression that they're all talk and
no substance, d jason
URUSEI
YATSURA
Slain By Urusei Yatsura
• • • •
T
hese Glaswegian lo-fi indie
terrorists have been thrashing
around for the last couple of
years, and were heaped with praise
by excited music journos, glad for a
break from the ruling Britpop norm
at the time. This band brought a
'fuck y o u ' attitude to the whole
happy, c h u m m y music biz world.
Their attitudes have not changed
an inch since their debut We Are
Urusei Yatsura, and to be honest
they have probably taken them fur-
ther to a scarier level, where they
shout about 'Killing Your Parents....'
and giving a big fat middle finger to
the industry they hate to be a part
of.
G/o Starz kicks the album off
with the opening line of 'I'm sorry,
I'm sorry , I'm sorry, I'm sorry', but
don't misunderstand their inten-
tions. They are N O T apologising in
advance for the album. The next
track that follows is the mightily
addictive Hello Tiger, a perfect
piece of m e s s e d up squealing
thrashy power p o p that y o u feel
you have to experience live to gain
the full and bloody effect. This is a
real grower, all the melodies, which
leap out at y o u whilst h i d d e n
between the axe grinding of the
guitars and shouty lyrics, insinuate
themselves into your thoughts.
It is a relief to hear s o m e
unashamed distorted guitars a n d
Pixies like inclinations from a rela-
tively n e w band. They are probably
not o l d enough t o have been
weaned o n Frank Black and co.'s
exciting take o n guitar rock.
Whatever they were listening to, it
must have been g o o d , or appalling-
ly bad (which explains the direction
they've taken). The shouty vocals
are so reminiscent of fellow
Glaswegians Bis, but thankfully Bis
ended up careering d o w n the path
to washed out headache inducing
b o r e d o m , while Urusei Yatsura did
themselves a favour and steered
well clear.
A s a live band y o u get the
impression they must kick ass, the
energy that lifts the album up o n
record must be intensely manic on
stage.
If y o u are slain after listening to
this record, then it is probably the
best w a y to g o . CI
