FLJB DRINKING FEATURE 25 March 1998
swiff
Sunday afternoons are never the
same without a G r a n d Prix to
watch; many of my formative
years were spent sat upon the
sofa with cups of tea and the
inane banter of Murray Walker,
cheering on my favourite dri-
vers.
However, long years of being a
student have jaded even the
simple pleasures of life, and to
keep the constant thrill neces-
sary I decided to swap my tea
for something a little more brac-
ing.
So get together some friends
and some booze and get play-
ing. You might want to be
careful and moderate some of
the rules. Those marked * are
only for the brave!
The Rules
ft- Firstly, decide h o w m u c h 1 unit
will be - for example a sip of beer.
Major drinking penalties are indi-
cated by \ About 10 units or
finishing your current drink will suf-
fice for this.
ft- Each player picks a driver
* alternatively, choose more than
A F o r m u l a 1 d r i n k i n g
g a m e f r o m M a r k B a k e r
one each.
* or randomly assign drivers so
that there's an equal chance of
being stuck with Panis or
Schumacher.
ft- At the start of the race, drink for
the duration of:
* the time between all lights lit and
going out.
* * the time between lights starting
to light and going out.
* * * the whole of the parade lap.
If any of your chosen drivers:
ft' ...is mentioned by a commenta-
tor - drink 1 unit,
ft' ...takes a pit stop - 3 units,
ft' ...takes a pit stop for longer
than 10 s e c o n d s - 6 units.
Alternatively, drink for the duration
of the pit s t o p * .
ft' ...crashes, has engine failure or
retires - You might want to
pick another driver*.
ft- If the driver then has a tantrum,
drink another 6 units.
If your drivers:
ft- wave or make 'hand signals' to
other drivers or officials - 3 units,
ft' are overtaken or overtakes - 2
units.
ft- are lapped - 3 units.
ft' are given a stop/go penalty -
or drink for its duration*.
P" finishes in the points (top 6) -
drink twice as many units as points
scored.
If there are obvious team orders at
any point (e.g. pulling over and let-
ting team-mate by) - drink 6 units.
If Murray says "and he must win
now" or equivalent doom-tempting
c o m m e n t - G~ .
Penalties for everyone:
ft- Murray Walker gets something
w r o n g - drink 2 units,
ft' Brundle / co-commentator cor-
rects him - drink 2 units more,
ft' ...in a sarcastic manner - drink 2
units once more.
If the race is re-started - $7 , ;
.
If a commentator says anything
dodgy e.g. "he's c o m i n g up fast
behind h i m ! " - drink 1 unit.
If anyone playing the game then
repeats the c o m m e n t - drink an
extra unit.
A final w o r d of warning: remember
that the race lasts for two hours!
The
traditional
game
This is a traditional "Formula 1"
drinking game. If y o u get bored
with my game, give this a try.
Alcoholics may wish to play both
games at once.
1. Arrange the players around a
table or in a line.
Brake!

2. To reverse direction of play, go
'eeeeerk!' (brakes!!) and make arm
movement as in diagram
3. To pass play to left, go 'vrooom'
and move arm to left.
4. To pass play to right, g o
' v r o o o m ' and move arm to right.
V r o o m !
5. If y o u yell 'Aryton Senna' every-
one has to go ' b o o o m l ' and wave
theirarms about.
6. If you yell 'Gear change' every-
one stands, changes gear (imagine
a gear box in front of you - use
your arm) and takes a drink. The
z *
Change gear...
next person carries on the game.
Any infringement of the rules leads
to drinking!
