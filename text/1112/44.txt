Cup Win for Hockey Guns Climbers
ICUHC I v RHUL I
Imagine a Tottenham vs Arsenal FA
Cup Final. N o w imagine Imperial vs
Royal Holloway. Having c o n c e d e d
Our B U S A cup place and the U L
cup to the s c u m and been called
the underdogs by the match pro-
gram, it was time for revenge.
The long match preparation started
with a relaxing stroll through the
trees, a w a r m up in s o m e random
cul-de-sac and some wise words in
the dressing r o o m .
Then the g a m e started. Within ten
minutes and two short corners we
found ourselves 2-0 d o w n . W e
continued to dominate the match,
enjoying virtually all the possession
and with about ten minutes to go in
the first half, legendary skipper
Chicken Bol skipped past his mark-
er and placed the ball onto the
Fluffy Cherub's stick w h o neatly
guided the ball into Sid the Sexist's
path for him to place the ball into
the R H U L net. 2-1.
After some inspirational half-time
deliberations, our h o p e s were
quickly dented by another R H U L
short corner goal. Then, as fitness
a n d availability of substitutes
became a factor, our domination
became awesome. Sid narrowed
the deficit to one goal and with two
minutes remaining, equalised
amongst scenes of euphoria when
the vastly outnumbered IC crowd
m o r e than m a t c h e d the R H U L
gathering for noise.
Extra time was thus necessary and
with the R H U L players standing on
their last legs, half the team should
have had hat-tricks, but all decided
that penalties were a crueler end
for the Holloway boys.
A n d so penalties were necessary.
With Big titties, Sid and N o d d y all
scoring convincingly and Red
Helmet saving or outnerving the
holloway players, we w o n convinc-
ingly 3-1.
M u c h alcohol w a s c o n s u m e d ,
many songs were sung and we
went to Southside to celebrate
apparently.
I'd like to thank all the players for a
brilliant season and my brother for
playing like shit.
ICUHC 1 3 - 3 RHUL I
IC win 3 - 1 on penalties.
ICUHC I Celebrate their victorious cup performance.
More Guns? Not Half!
Last S a t u r d a y , members of ICRPC
ventured on to the frozen wastes
of Bisley to shoot for the Courtman
shield. This is an inter-CCU full
bore rifle competition shot at 300
yards The teams' members ran the
whole gamut of experiences from
old sweats to those w h o had never
shot full bore before.
Scores were erratic due to the
strong and changeable winds blow-
ing that day. Nevertheless some
impressive scores were recorded
and the day was most successful.
Final scores were close but C &.
G were adjudged to be the victors,
largely due to their superior n u m -
bers.
Thanks to A n d r e w for his self-
less coaching and also to all those
who proved themselves well skilled
at the art of buttmarking. O o h
M a t r o n !
This weekend saw the B U S A rifle
match held in the earthly paradise
that is Sutton Coldfield. The uni-
versity of London fielded a team of
eight, six of which hailed from
Imperial.
M a n y of the UL team achieved
impressive scores, particularly
Andrew ' W i l d m a n ' Eldridge, w h o
was let in the team despite having
spread slanderous rumours about
captain Gareth.
Though tipped as favourites, the
UL team only managed second,
with Edinburgh taking first place.
This was due mostly to one of the
non-Imperial members shooting
like an arse.
The English University men's team
(two of w h o m were IC shooters)
d r e w 1 156 ex 1200 with the
Scottish universities and the
English Universities w o m e n beat
the Scots.
Imperial scores (ex 200)
Rachael Ambrose - 191
Andrew Eldridge - 195
Gareth Hillier - 193
Phil Golds - 191
Andy Forsyth - 183

And More
Guns
The Imperial College Rifle and
Pistol Club Ladies Team recently
put in a sterling performance
against the R S M Rifle Team. In this
tight fought competition our team
did us proud despite Neela, it's
foremost member having inade-
quate clavicle-scapular invagina-
tion (I'm assured this is not what
y o u might suspect - Ed). The
w o m e n ' s t e a m saw Impressive
performances by both Sascha
Klengel and Rickitina Anglerud, our
Swedish Blonde who's consistent
performances have placed her at
2nd in the ICRPC Duelling Ladder.
Eventually R S M claimed the
lead thanks to boy wonder Nick
Royall w h o overcame his youth
and inexperience to put in a great
performance that makes us believe
that he could grow up to be a very
useful shot.
W e ' d like to thank all those
w h o participated and wish The fair
Simone Parton g o o d luck with her
new diet program.
Final score
ICURPC Ladies 1173 - 1189 RSM.
Face Uphill
Struggle
The first competition to ever be
attended by the Mountaineering
Club and after keeping the o p p o -
sition awake half the night with a
didgeridoo we felt our chances
were g o o d . O n arriving, after a
m a m m o t h tour of Sheffield, the
teams chose their routes and set-
tled d o w n . The first time period
started only too quickly with Ruth
and Nick getting off to a cracking
start, Ruth scoring a magnificent
1 14 points giving her a fantastic
13th overall position.
The next session saw Daffy
and M i k e putting in sterling perfor-
mances, bagging 115 and 121
points respectively. The final ses-
sion saw Rich and Simon pitched
against s o m e hardcore opposition
from the other university squads.
Both d i d exceptionally well getting
136 and 140 points respectively,
putting the 1st team into 21st
position out of 45. (The second
team was disqualified for not hav-
ing a female member, how IC?)
Overall a seminal performance
with m u c h for the guys and gal to
be proud of, giving a solid basis
with which to continue with next
year. Cool.
