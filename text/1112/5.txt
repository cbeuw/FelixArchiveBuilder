EASTERN PROMISES
Dear Sir
The Times (No. 66144) reports
that Newcastle University have set
aside £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 as part of a pack-
age of assistance for Far East stu-
dents w h o have seen their curren-
cy value drop by 30% in the last
few months. Furthermore, universi-
ty administrators are prepared to
reduce next year's fees to encour-
age their Indonesian, Malaysian,
Korean and Thai students to return.
1 trust that M r Heeps &. col-
leagues are ploughing their full
efforts into urging Imperial College
to introduce a similarly imaginative
p r o g r a m m e . Imperial College is
rich with diverse cultures from all
over the globe and it would be a
shame if this world-leading univer-
sity were to show itself unrespon-
sive t o a situation facing s o many
of its finest students.
Yours faithfully,
M a l c o l m John
ARTSOC FIGHT
BACK
Dear Felix,
O n Tuesday 1 I 7 M a r c h , the
Union Finance Committee met t o
decide upon club and society bud-
gets for the forthcoming year. All
C C U and CSC society budgets were
decided in this o n e evening alone.
As current Arts Appreciation chair-
person, I a m writing to express m y
concerns as to the fairness and jus-
tification of the decisions that were
reached.
It w a s decided that the Artsoc
subsidy budget for next year should
be reduced from the submitted
total of approximately £ 1300 to
zero. Grounds for this slash in bud-
get were based o n general cutting
back in the Union, but in particular
to redirect money for the IC Boat
Club, w h o wish to purchase anoth-
er boat. I accept the need for eval-
uating budgets carefully, and reas-
signing funds if necessary.
However, 1 find the shocking and
completely unexpected news of
complete removal of Artsoc sub-
sidy unfair and unmerited, for rea-
sons which I will briefly explain.
Artsoc uses the Union subsidy
to make the Arts more affordable
to the average student. In particu-
lar, ballet, opera and large musicals
are well beyond the price-range of
many students, and by wisely sub-
sidising certain of these trips,
Artsoc has enabled over 2 2 0 m e m -
bers t o appreciate the cultural
events that they would otherwise
be unable t o see, and t o meet like-
minded students w h o are interest-
ed in the Arts.
What I find most worrying is
the fact that this drastic decision
was made very quickly, and with-
out informing either t h e Artsoc
treasurer or myself, w h o could
have attended the U F C meeting
and explained the situation from
Artsoc's point of view. At the very
least, I believe that Artsoc should
have had the opportunity t o dis-
cuss t h e p r o b l e m s facing t h e
finance committee BEFORE a vote
was taken to remove our subsidy.
Surely this present system is unfair,
and leaves critical decisions in the
hands of a committee w h o are
unlikely t o know about the organi-
sation and operation of the majori-
ty of clubs.
It is also rather concerning that
the UFC did not appear to take into
account that Artsoc is the largest
non-overseas society in the union,
and the interests of its 2 2 0 m e m -
bers were not considered. I find it
unbelievable n o w t o discover that
w e have a budget less than most
societies of similar nature w h o
have a n overall membership not
even a quarter of that of Artsoc.
It w a s suggested in the U F C
meeting that Artsoc merely pays
for students t o enjoy themselves
on theatre trips. It is true that the
Arts are enjoyable, a n d members
enjoy being a part of Artsoc. Surely
this is the case for other societies
I a m sure the rowers of IC, ten pin
bowlers and parachutists, to name
random clubs, also enjoy their club
activities! The Artsoc constitution
clearly states that the aims a n d
objectives of the society are to pro-
mote the appreciation of the Arts
by organising group trips, but also
to make the Arts more accessible
to students by subsidising such
trips. Artsoc have adhered to the
constitution, a n d I feel that this
sudden reduction in funding is both
unfair and has not been warranted.
If the Arts in particular are
being targeted as "unnecessary" or
of inferior importance to sporting
clubs within IC, then I a m honestly
quite disgusted. It is a great shame
that 2 2 0 keen and enthusiastic stu-
dents, interested in having a well-
rounded education by the inclusion
of culture into their heavy scientific
workloads, should be taken t o be
less worthy than other clubs.
Yours faithfully,
Angela Parkin, C h e m Eng 2
Artsoc chairperson

Dear Felix,
The Union have h a d t o cut
funding for next session therefore
some societies have had their sub-
sudies r e d u c e d . This is under-
standable but w h e n the it is c o m -
pletely w i p e d out this is unaccept-
able. The subsidy for Artsoc. has
fallen from £ 1 2 0 0 t o £ 0 , this is an
outrage. What the union have prac-
tically done is obliterate a very suc-
cesfull society which boasts around
230 members. Their pathetic rea-
son was that Artsoc pay for people
to g o to the theatre and have a
g o o d time, and therefore subsidies
on these activites are unjustified.
Isn't that the aim of most clubs, for
poeple t o g o out a n d enjoy them-
selves? I'm sure poeple in other
clubs enjoy themselves a n d the
clubs they participate in offer the
oppurtunity t o d o something inter-
esting and open their minds to new
areas. This is exactly what Artsoc
does; gives students the oppurtu-
nity t o s a m p l e t h e culture in
London. It provides a service by
encouraging Art in all shapes and
forms giving students a rounded
e d u c a t i o n . A l l this crap about
unjustified subsidies is unjustified.
If they have t o cut subsidies o.k but
axing the whole budget is ludi-
crous. I'm sure this is just a misun-
derstanding and it is only a matter
of time before y o u (union) retract
your stupid shortsighted proposal
and give us o u r subsidy back.
Thank y o u very m u c h .

NOTHING TO
DANCE TO
Dear all.
I a m writing in response t o
Darshan Arun letter from last week,
which w a s complaining about the
lack of general dance music nights,
especially in specialist areas. I
agree with Darshan totally there
should be more events like Tha
B o m b a n d The Electric Cafe a n d
respect t o Milan and Alick Sethi for
actually being able to put these
nights on, as I know h o w hard it is
