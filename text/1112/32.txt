THE UNITED COLOURS OF
ADAM F
A
dam F is the man behind the
first underground drum &
bass track to truly cross-
over into the mainstream, putting
drum & bass in the public eye for
the first time for all the right
reasons.
Two years after its initial
release, Circles, a massive under-
ground anthem, was picked up by
the likes of Radio One and Kiss
FM due to it's sheer quality and
originality, although they were
slow on the uptake.
With the support of the radio
stations, Circles hit the national
charts at Number 19. This show-
ing that the true underground
drum &. bass tracks can easily
compete with more traditional
styles of music, if they can only
get equal air play. People won't go
out and buy records they have
never heard.
After the success of Circles,
Adam was a wanted by several
major labels w h o had realised that
they could make money from drum
&. bass. At only 25, A d a m is already
one of the major players in the
scene with a string of ground break-
ing tunes under his belt.
Metropolis r e c o r d e d o n the
legionary M e t a l h e a d z label
increased A d a m s ' status, a tune
well ahead of its time with a phat
and totally original bassline that
took drum &. bass in yet another
direction. It was one of those piv-
otal tracks that s u m m e d up the vibe
of the time and will be played for
years to c o m e . A n d w h o could for-
get Aromatherapy on Section 5
records?
A d a m kindly took time out of his
hectic schedule to talk to me about
his new album Colours and the
music on his mind.
JP. Other than remixes, there's
only four new tracks on Colours.
Why is this ?
AF. "Well it's as m u c h about
getting the stuff I have already
released heard by a larger audience,
as tracks like Metropolis y o u proba-
bly haven't heard unless y o u go out
to the right clubs, or buy a lot of
vinyl, so this is aimed more towards
educating people w h o are not so
into the scene as well as releasing
s o m e new material"
JP. The new single Music in my
Mind is another wicked track that
is also getting a little bit of air
time on the major radio stations.
Do you think it will chart ?
AF. What ever happens, hap-
pens. 1 try not to set expectations
as y o u only get disappointed
) P. If it does, would you go on
Top of The Pops, as I know some
people have something against
going on shows like that ?
AF. If it seemed right at the time
yes I would, I have had offers to go
on shows like TFI Friday and that.
With TV, with all the profile 8. pub-
licity y o u get it's not a bad thing,
it's all about h o w y o u present your-
self, but y o u will not catch me on
any kids shows or anything like that.
|P. So we won't be seeing you
on Alive 'n' Kicking then?
AF. N o not at all
JP. Do you feel it is a good or
bad thing that all the big name
producers and Djs being signed
up to the major labels?
AF. Well I can't speak for other
people, each person has to weigh
up the options and work out what is
best for themselves. 1 spoke with
Goldie, Groovrider and a few others
who have already been signed to
majors and decided that EMI were
offering the best deal for me. It's
nice to get that security, the finan-
cial backing to d o what you love
with out having to worry about
money all the time. 1 feel it is impor-
tant for me to be with a major label
as they have the experience of pro-
moting on a worldwide scale and
that's what the scene needs.
JP. Do you still maintain full
control over your musical
direction ?
AF. Yes, they have set me up
with my own label F-Jams, which I
have full control over from the art-
work to musical direction every-
thing, what they bring as I said
before is the promotional experi-
ence.
JP. Do you feel this music can
go the same way that rap music
has and build its own empire ?
AF. well if y o u think about it, ten
years ago rap music was in the
position that drum &. bass is today,
and they both started in one small
place and grew from there, so
hopefully, yes.
JP. Is there a chance of the
music losing its underground
flavour with the majors getting
involved ?
AF. N o matter what happens
the music will always stay alive, no
matter h o w big it gets, whether
people want to water it d o w n or
what ever there will always be peo-
ple w h o make music for the love of
it not the money, if y o u look at hip-
hop music it's changed from where
it started but still maintains flavour
JP. Can the music maintain it's
underground flavour and gain
mass appeal?
AF. Yes, just look at Circles. 1
didn't remix it or anything for the
charts, it was the same as the orig-
inal release a few years earlier and it
gained wide spread acclaim and
after getting air play it reached
number 19 in the national charts, so
that proves that it can"
JP. You have been touring a lot
the last year what is the world
scene like, is it picking up?
AF. Yes, I have been to Brazil,
Japan and America recently. Japan's
on it in a big way, that's where the
album sold second best after here,
they have got a g o o d little scene
going on over there. Brazil was
mad, there is not much of a scene
there but they are a crazy party m a d
nation w h o are up for anything,
Americas know what is going on,
they have got a lot of small scenes
dotted about over the country, the
place is just so big that they are all
very spread out, but there is a bases
for the scene to grow out there.
JP. What influences your work?
AF. Everything, I listen to every-
thing, from R'n'B, soul, hip-hop to
whatever.
JP. What's in your car stereo
at the moment?
AF. It changes every day, but at
the m o m e n t I've been listen to
Goldie's new album.
JP. What do you think of it?
AF. It's g o o d to see something
he has been working on for so long
to finally be finished and released, I
think it's very g o o d .
JP. What our your plans for the
rest of the year?
M o r e touring, I'm back off to
Japan soon, and concentrating on
the live s h o w and on making it a
better show watch.
JP. With your shows are you
going for a more live sound?
Not live as in acoustic, the bass
player for example has all key-
boards and samplers round his neck
as well as acoustic bass instru-
ments, so he has all the different
sounds there at his fingertips.
The live show is so intense, we
have all the different bass lines their
so we can switch straight from one
to another, w e play with the audi-
ence. W e have all live breaks 'n'
synthesised sounds, mixing the
sounds live. If y o u want us to drop
in the Metropolis bass-line over say
Circles w e can, it's not like w e will
be there on stage playing flutes and
things, but saying that I have tried
everything over the last year.
If y o u fancy see the man live
and direct, y o u can catch him down
the Astoria check club listings for
dates.
Jo Public.
