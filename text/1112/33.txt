Emotional times, dear Felix readers, as this is
the last radio station page of this term.
Consequently I thought that it would be apt if I
gave y o u all a round up of what we've been
doing this term to provide y o u with aural plea-
sure.
W e ' v e been interviewing, recording, and
watching bands as regularly as Diana tributes
have been appearing in the tabloids. W e ' v e
recorded Fidel, Dererro, Spectre, Varnaline and
the Interpreters in our Northside Studios, and
have interviewed the likes of Evil Superstars,
the Hormones, the Crockets, The ' O ' , and
Scoot, to name a few. W e ' v e also done a live
link up with the Counting Crowes at the Albert
Hall, and have had D) Hurricaine (DJ with the
Beastie Boys) in to d o a set, as well as broad-
casting a specially recorded set with M o n e y
Mark. Not bad, eh?
Anyone can take part in any part of IC
Radio: interviewing, recording, DJing, or going
to free gigs. If this appeals to you, then join- it's
as simple as that. All you have to d o is p o p into
our Southside Studio and say what you want to
do. |on Crabb

There's a mass of film releases over the Easter vacation and so we are
giving you a selection of the best (and the worst)...
MONEY TALKS
Starring: Heather Locklear
Director:Brett Ratner
Release: 3 April
• •
M
ix Richard Pryor (30%)
with Eddie M u r p h y (70%),
and saturate the resulting
crude product with helium to yield
Chris Tucker.
Last seen as the irritating c a m p
pop-star in The Fifth Element,
Tucker is fortunately more bearable
in this role. H e plays a fast-talking
small-time con-artist wrongly
blamed for a deadly prison break.
Baddies and goodies are all after
him and his only hope rests with
gravel v o i c e d cynical n e w s m a n
Charlie Sheen w h o is hunting for
that headline exclusive. For some
reason they only have err...two
days in which to resolve it all.
Sheen is second fiddle and acts
accordingly, which reminds us that
he hasn't made a g o o d film for a
while. There is a more successful
o n - s c r e e n chemistry between
Tucker and Paul Sorvino, the latter
reprising light-heartedly his charac-
ter in Coodfellas.
Tucker is the star and is actual-
ly quite funny, while the plot moves
along nicely with copious explo-
sions and a g o o d climax. It's just
that the film should have been
called Beverly Hills Weapon 48.
The only surprise is that the main
baddie is French - "Kill z e m ali" -
rather than English - "I a m going to
kill y o u now old chap!". Not really
worth the price of a cinema ticket,
so wait for it to c o m e out on video,
call a few mates round and with the
money saved buy some Dorito's, a
few dips and get the beers in.

Win Gridlock'd on video
Cridlock'd is released by Polygram Video on 6 April, priced £ 12.99. It's a
refreshingly different film about drug addicts which avoids many of the
usual stereotypes. It's about two buddies, one black (the late Tupac
Shakur) and one white (Tim Roth), but for once it's the black bloke who's
the level-headed sensible guy and the white one that's the crazy ass
dude.
The two are part of a jazz band along with Shakur's girlfriend. W h e n
she O D ' s and ends up in a c o m a they decide that it's finally time to kick
the habit and get clean, and the film tracks the day that follows. The prob-
lem is that there's a huge obstacle in their way - bureaucracy. Forms,
queues and more forms conspire to prevent the t w o likeable leads getting
into rehab.
This is an impressive directorial debut by Vondie Curtis Hall, w h o has
created a very individual, stylish film. M u c h of the sardonic script is spot-
on and he combines this with some truly hilarious moments. If there is
one criticism of the film it is that it's slightly lightweight, with too many
shots of the duo fleeing from the police rater than developing the plot.
However, it's still very enjoyable with great dialogue in places.
FFI Beatwax have given us two copies of Cridlock'd to give away.
To enter, simply e-mail felix@ic.ac.uk with "Gridlock'd" as the subject
and we will pick the names out of the proverbial hat on Friday.
