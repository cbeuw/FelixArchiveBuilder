GATTACA
Starring: Ethan Hawke, U m a Thurman, Jude Law, Gore Vidal
Director:Andrew Niccoi

fter the recent Dolly devel-
opments it was inevitable
that a cloning film w o u l d be
released sooner or later. Cattaca is
the first such movie and portrays
the frightening image of a future
where couples choose their chil-
dren from a catalogue. In a world
where perfection is cherished it is
the ultimate gamble to conceive a
child by natural means. The results
of this genetic role of the dice are
an underclass labelled "in-valids",
who are unable to c o m p e t e with
their stronger, healthier and more
intelligent opponents.
O n e such in-valid is Ethan
Hawke. The second he was born a
blood test revealed that he w o u l d
die of a heart condition at the age
of 29. W h e n he fails to get a job
due to his imperfections he "bor-
rows" the identity of the valid Jude
Law, using his body fluids to pass
the tests to get a job with Gattaca,
a space travel organisation. Here
he meets U m a T h u r m a n a n d
attempts to achieve his d r e a m of

reaching Saturn before he dies.
Cattaca was written a n d
directed by A n d r e w Niccoi and is
clearly a very personal version of
the future. His is a sterile, imper-
sonal world where genes are all
important and unpredictability is a
thing of the past. The downside of
this intriguing film is that this
imagery dominates so that sub-

Q u e n t i n Tarantino's latest film
stars P a m Grier, Samuel L Jackson
and Robert De Niro. The cult
director has m o v e d away from the
style of his first t w o hits and
instead concentrates on a solid
storyline about a gun-smuggling air
hostess. The acting is superb
throughout, especially by Grier and
Michael Keaton, and helps make
this another fine addition to
Tarantino's stable. To win one of
five pairs of tickets, e-mail us and

What was the name of Samuel

Ethan Hawke is an imperfect
human in a perfect world
plots and character development
are often confused. Furthermore,
when the plot does develop it is
often as predictable as the world in
which it is set. However, there are
several clever touches and the act-
ing is more than adequate, making
this film a worthwhile way to spend
a couple of hours and far superior
to Sphere. O Chris Hickey

O n e thing y o u can
safely say about David
Lynch is that he
doesn't make ordinary
films. Lost Highway,
starring Bill Pullman and Patricia
Arquette, is a bizarre mix of film
genres that constantly takes y o u by

films this mix of murder, mystery
and suspense will be a memorably
creepy alternative. O

Well, a decent storyline might
help. Sphere is based o n a Michael
Crichton novel (which was written
before The Abyss so no
accusations of plagiarism please)
and suffers f r o m a surplus of
ambition. It assumes the audience
is bored with little green men and
so instead concentrates on the
psychological effect of being con-
fronted with an alien species.
The direction the film is going
in is m a d e clear in the opening
scenes, w h e n we see that the crew
sent to investigate the craft is an
unarmed collection of academics,
including a psychiatrist (Hoffman),
mathematician (Jackson) and a
biochemist (Stone). Their initial
interaction w i t h the ship is
fascinating but the sense of
mystery is lost as the audience
realises that no explanations will
be given. Rather, Levinson sticks
rigidly to the (frankly unexciting)
book and the degenerating state
of the crew's minds.
This is all a bit of a shame since
the trailers implied that Sphere is a
gripping Event Horizon meets The
Abyss affair. The reality is that it is
a psychological thriller which just
happens to be set near an alien
craft. A s a result it will disappoint
almost everybody w h o sees it. D

N o r o o m for a review of Most]
Wanted. H o w e v e r , it's an
adequate action thriller with Jon
Voight (yet again).
LOST HIGHWAY 1 87
Samuel L Jackson followed Pulp
Fiction and A Time To Kill with this
dark thriller set in a Los Angeles
s c h o o l . H e gives an excellent
performance as a teacher whose
very life is threatened by the vio-
lence of the classroom. Depressing
and bleak, this nonetheless carries
a powerful message about the
American education system. See

two copies.
