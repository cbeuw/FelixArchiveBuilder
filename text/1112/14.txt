N
orma] life is gradually
returning t o Imperial
College this week - Rag
Week is over a n d it is once more
safe to wander the campus with-
out being squirted, splattered with
foam or m o o n e d at. After last
term's belly-flop, the raggies have
returned if not with a bang, at least
with a g o o d loud fart. Thanks to
various d u b i o u s s e m i - c l o t h e d
events, they have managed to
raise over £ 2 0 0 0 for the charities
Leukemia Research, Riding for the
Disabled a n d C A G .
Events kicked off o n 9 M a r c h
with a show by the renowned hyp-
notist (and ex-Felix editor) Martin
Taylor in dBs. Elvis impersonations
and excessive tie wearing ensued,
, but as yet, no nakedness.
This w a s s o o n corrected by
the C&.G Slave Auction. Seen by
many as the beginning of the
demise of civilisation, the event
also raised over £ 5 0 0 . Bidding was
initially sluggish, with M r
Manandhar a n d M r C u o m o fetch-
ing just £ 5 each (although this was
£ 4 . 9 0 over the reserve). Executive
slaved generated more interest,
with Katie Armstrong going for
£ 5 5 a n d Andy H e e p s bottling out
and purchasing himself for £ 1 0 0 .
Not content with this, the audi-
ence clubbed together to raise a
further £ 6 0 to force him to derobe
and wobble his blubber. It is not
known which misguided individual
masterminded this exercise. T w o
of the more unfortunate slaves,

Auction - a walkway run in drag for just £ 6 .

Louise Windsor, were compelled to streak
along the walkway wearing lingerie (left).
H L W , we're waiting.
Last week also saw the initiation of Killer -
an incomprehensible game of inventive homi-
cide involving water pistols and rubber knives.
Someone has apparently w o n the game, due
to everyone else being dead, although we're
not certain w h o it is.
Skipping over the inexplicable Great
Hedge H o g Hunt, the next deranged fund-
raiser was the infamous SNKP) (Sponsored
N u d e Kamikaze Parachute jump, don't y o u
know) which involved eight students of ques-
tionable sanity making their way as slowly as
possible from Harrods to the Union wearing
their best birthday suit. C o m p o u n d i n g
passers-by a n d avoiding the long arm of the
law, the runners managed to raise £ 7 0 0 and
get onto page three of the Sun. G o o d work,
fellas.
N o sooner had the hangovers worn off,
but it was time for the R S M 3-legged 70s pub
crawl. Dress to look like a washed-up hippie,
get drunk and tie yourself to a mate to make
walking even harder than usual, let alone pee-
ing. W e were unable to find anyone sober
enough to explain why they did this, although
one sesquiped drunkard managed to mumble
the immortal words "It's charity, mate."
All in all, Rag Week hauled in £ 2 1 4 4 (not
forgetting the RCS beer festival last term), a
considerable improvement over last year and A
miraculous return from the grave. ICU Rag can
once again stick its proud arse in the air and
s o m e h o w get people to pay for the privilege.
Eeee-ooo. Lock up your daughters, here
comes Andy Heeps' belly...
