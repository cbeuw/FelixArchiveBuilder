FEES SURVEY
A "detailed" survey into universi-
ty life published last w e e k
reveals w i d e s p r e a d c o n c e r n
about tuition fees and the with-
drawal of the m a i n t e n a n c e
grant. Student Life, sponsored
by Channel 4, asked 6,349 final-
ists at 19 universities around the
country, including U C L and IC
about their finances, lifestyles,
attitudes to the m e d i a and plans
for life.
16% of the students inter-
v i e w e d said had they been
made to pay tuition fees of
£ 1 , 0 0 0 a year they w o u l d have
been unlikely to have c o m e to
university at all, whilst forty per-
cent of those surveyed w o u l d
have stayed away if they had
known about the potential
£ 10,000 debts they may face on
graduation. The survey also
revealed that 66% of students
considered cannabis an accept-
able drug for personal use, with
only 14% approving of cocaine
and 5% in favour of heroin and
crack. Friends w a s the most
popular TV s h o w and the Spice
Girls were the personalities with
w h o m students would least like
to be stuck in a lift. Only one
student in six would support the
Conservative Party if there were
a General Election t o m o r r o w ,
compared with 34% for Labour
and 22% for the Liberal
Democrats.
SCHINDLERS'
LIFTS
Workers for the c o m p a n y pro-
viding the lifts in the new B M S
building w e n t o n strike this
m o n t h over a pay d i s p u t e .
Following months of arguments
between the directors of
Schindlers and the w o r k e r s '
union, where the union claimed
the p r o p o s e d deal "greatly
reduces our earnings while
adversely affecting our individual
contracts" and saw the strike as
their only alternative. Schindlers
declined to c o m m e n t on the
matter and denied the very exis-
tence of the strike. Phil Hilton,
Schal's B M S Project Executive,

Cannabis Campaign Hits the Park
ED SEXTON
This Saturday (28 March) thou-
sands of protesters will inarch
through London in the largest
pro-cannabis demonstration to
be held in the capital for thirty
years. The event is being organ-
ised by the Independent on
Sunday, which is attempting to
increase the profile of its 'decrimi-
nalise cannabis' campaign.
Indeed the march already looks
set to be a high profile event, with
participants including Paul Flynn,
the Labour M P heading efforts to
change the law o n cannabis, and
M a r c o Pennella, founder of the
Italian Radical Party. A host of
other politicians and campaigners
are expected to show their sup-
port; H o w a r d Marks, the ex-smug-
gler [Felix 1095], will be speaking at
the event, as will Independent on
Sunday editor Rosie Boycott, w h o
started the c a m p a i g n last
September. M a n y bands and per-
formers are expected to be a m o n g
the crowd, including Dodgy, Paul
Weller, Primal Scream and Finley
Quaye.

The march begins at midday by
Reformers Tree in H y d e Park and
will proceed to Trafalgar Square,
where the speakers will address the
rally. It is uncertain how many peo-
ple will take part in the protest: A
few weeks ago police estimated
between five and ten thousand
would attend the event, but they
have since revised their estimate
and n o w fear that the c r o w d may
exceed the 16,000 capacity of
Trafalgar Square. Speaking to Felix,
Chris Brown, a voluntary helper and
spokesperson for the march, sug-
gested that there may be as many
as 3 0 , 0 0 0 on the rally, although he
did point out that "it could be any
size".
The purpose of the demonstra-
tion is to move the cannabis debate
on, putting pressure on the govern-
ment to review the 1971 Misuse of
Drugs Act. M r Brown expressed his
wish for the march to highlight the
serious issues surrounding
cannabis use, particularly its role in
relieving the s y m p t o m s of many
diseases, such as arthritis, M S and
AIDS. H e a d d e d "I don't want it to
be a big spliff rally."

ULU Election Results - Do You Care?
DAVID ROBERTS
The elections for next year's
University of London Union sab-
batical team took place last
Monday, attracting heavy criti-
cism of their electoral process,
and loud bellows of "Farce" from
ICU President Andy Heeps.
85 people are eligible to vote in
the elections, which determine next
year's President, three Vice-
Presidents and the editor for U L U ' s
sttfdent newspaper, London
Student. The electoral process
came under fire from the entire IC
delegation, with last year's ICU
President, Eric Allsop, suggesting
that "totalitarian dictatorships show
more signs of democracy", and
raiding questions as to whether the
general student populace "actually
care". The main objection was the
quizzing of the candidates at the
discretion of the returning officer,
who was not a himself a student.
Amongst those elected was Rob
Clark, this year's Deputy President
(Finance &. Services) at ICU, w h o
w o n u n o p p o s e d as U L U VP
(Finance Societies) for 1998-9,
on a platform of financial stability
and accountability.
Elsewhere, Matt Hyde, present-
ly President of Q u e e n M a r y &.
Westfield Union emerged victorious
over Mari Williams, to win the elec-
tion for U L U President. In a bizarre
turn-around on previous years', M s
Williams admission of Labour m e m -
bership resulted in boos and jeering
from the assembled delegates,
whilst M r Hyde's promise not to
tow the N U S line was received with
cheers from the floor. M r Hyde
p r o m i s e d to ensure value-for-
m o n e y for U L U colleges by
"Providing strong services... looking
beyond Mallet Street, taking U L U to
it's m e m b e r colleges... finding
untapped areas." Nick Dunnett,
from Royal Holloway College, w o n
u n o p p o s e d as VP (Sports). He
insisted that U L U sport is still
important, "playing in London wide
teams is the only time that we can
come together as one complete
University", although he did accept
that "we need to review ail inter-
collegiate sport so that everyone
can maximise their potential". In his
manifesto M r Dunnett also
promised to prioritise safety, so
that "every sportsperson knows
that they play in a 'Safe Sport'", and
to strive to increase outside spon-
sorship.
The third Vice-President posi-
tion, that of VP (Welfare 8. Student
Affairs), was filled by Bee Kiiroy,
from the School of Slavonic and
East European Studies. She
promised to be a "Strong and inde-
pendent voice, reflecting action".
She saw her primary role as cam-
paigning, particularly on tuition fees
"an area I feel passionately about...
I see them as a threat to basic stu-
dent rights". To this e n d , she
promised to promote access to
information on campaigning,
including a 'campaigns database'
accessible on the W W W . Like her
o p p o n e n t s , M a r c Jay and Allan
Witherick, M s Kiiroy also promised
to work on the problem of accom-
modation "which is both expensive
and insufficiently catered for by col-
leges."
Finally, T o m Belton, currently
editor of Roar (the King's College
newspaper), was elected as London
Student Editor for 1998-9. Although
having no experience at London
Student, M r Belton promised to
ensure that "the paper will come
out fortnightly and in full colour",
making it "a reliable and regular
entity". H e also promised to secure
a 28 day F M radio license "to cover
freshers week", and to secure a
profitable advertising deal, so that
"it will eventually make a profit and
cease to be a drain o n Union
funds."
