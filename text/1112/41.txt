Not another C&.C clone w e all cry
- Well yes and no. It's a strategy
game that uses resource manage-
ment to build bases and w i p e the
enemy off the m a p - so yes. But
definitely no when it c o m e s to the
gameplay and graphics. Insteadof
the standard view from above,
you walk and fight on the frontline
while you order in AI allied units to
support, attack, defend and build.
Just ignore the pseudo story about
a 1960's hot war and it sounds a
winner.
Running on a low e n d PC
(PI20) it looks nothing special,
the polygons are quick, though
plain; it plays well and gets addic-
tive quite quickly - so don't start
unless y o u have several hours
spare. Taking it to a P 2 0 0 with a
decent (but not state of the art)
graphics card and it just looks
soooo g o o d . The vehicles have
polygon textures - The US 50's
style nose paint and the USSR big
red stars, and sprint about the
screen (and this isn't even with 3-
D acceleration). The audio side is
fairly standard with radio instruc-
tions and some gun noise being
the extent of play in this 90%
complete version. The gameplay
though is just excellent - with both
single and now universal multiplay
network options. But it is the idea
that y o u can and should lead your
forces into battles being the
sponge, creamy interior and icing
on the gameplay sponge cake.
You can swap between vehicles
during a battle, bail out and snipe
at the e n e m y pilots, capture
enemy vehicles. If they just tweak
the sound for the final release it is
going to be big.

MYTHS : THE
FALLEN LORDS
PC
Real time strategy g a m e s are
everywhere. O n the PC a n d
Playstation owners have lost whole
days and nights battling using an
enemy using tanks, dragons and
even the o d d psychopathic female
c o m m a n d o .
But a new generation of real
time strategy games is about to hit
the shore. These use a true 3-D
representation of the battlefield
rather than the pseudo 3-D views.
In the vanguard for the fantasy
based games is M y t h s . Your view
of the battlefield can be z o o m e d ,
panned and rotated, but only as far
as y o u have explored with your
troops. The graphics are impres-
sive even on a basic PI 20, with
blood and bits of body soon litter-
ing the countryside and towns. The
C O M P E T I T I O N
41
audio effects are pretty
m u c h what y o u w o u l d
expect with background
bird twittering, speech and bang-
ing, along with a vocal message
every time a brave warrior gets
hacked or blown up.
Its the gameplay that courts
and while it is addictive, it can get
very frustrating. Without the ability
to build m o r e units the g a m e
rapidly b e c o m e s one of trying to
force a winning position tactically
rather than strategically. Sacrificing
units b e c o m e s much more risky
with the loss of individuals rapidly
turning fatal for the skirmish (con-
stant restoring of saved positions
being the norm). The method of
selecting differing battlegroups is
too slow, once a melee starts try-
ing to complete an ordered retreat
becomes very difficult and costly.
This aside it is a better than aver-
age g a m e a n d will keep the
electricity companies happy until
the release of C&.C 2.
