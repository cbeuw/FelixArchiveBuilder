10 COLUMNS 25 March 1998
C o o k is under heat again.
It appears that his latest
foray into another world
region has resulted in the
usual gaffes, snubs a n d insults.
C o o k has been written about
before, at length, and m y opinion
of him had never been ecstatic. His
performance in the United States,
India, Europe and so on, plus his
public and disgraceful treatment of
his wife of twenty-eight years (who
has now just divorced him, leaving
him free to marry his secretary)
never endeared him to the public.
His ability to weigh on delicate
arguments between various fac-
tions has resulted in many compar-
isons with Northern Ireland.
Recently he went on a tour of the
Middle East, and c a m e back with
abuse from all sides.
Cook's troubles have led many
to re-evaluate their opinion of the
worthiness of the job of Foreign
Secretary. Considered by many to
the best job in the Cabinet, it is the
highest position in it save that of
Prime Minister, conferring perks
and privileges, plus the opportunity
to leave the constricting grasp of
domestic politics and worries, and
look at the wider world issues and
problems. However it is also the
most punishing of Cabinet appoint-
ments. Travelling is constant,
paperwork ever-coming and diary
packed. A n d for the most part, the
work is the slow grind of diplomacy
which is always required but will
confer no great historical distinc-
tion upon the person concerned.
Yet upon their shoulders rests the
responsibility to deal with s o m e of
the great historical conflicts of the
world.
O n e of those conflicts is the
Israeli-Palestinian 'peace process',
as it is still called in politer diplo-
matic circles. Cook's foray into
Israel and Palestine caused numer-
ous upsets, with changes of plan
and rewritten schedules at the last
minute to a c c o m m o d a t e aggrieved
representatives of various sides of
the divide. Even the U.S. State
D e p a r t m e n t is agitated , with
what else can a well-populated
continent, residing just to the west
of the said area, s o m e of w h o s e
countries governed M i d d l e East
nations in days of Empire, whose
workforce and student population
work and study in each others
regions, that has historical links
(and battles) going back to prehis-
tory, actually know? Unless, as is
expected, Europe simply doesn't
understand Europe from the per-
spective of the g o o d M r
Netanyahu.

spokesmen remarking that recent
events have "not helped". Cook
himself downgraded his o w n inten-
tions, saying in an after-dinner
s p e e c h to the A n g l o - A r a b
Association that he hoped to give
the p e a c e process "a helpful
nudge".
The problems behind this lie
deeper than just what happened in
the M i d d l e East last week. W h e n
C o o k outlined his intentions for the
European Union to take a larger
role in the M i d d l e East, the Israeli
Prime Minister, Binyamin
Netanyahu retorted that Europe
'doesn't understand the M i d d l e
East'. To offer a personal opinion.
European countries, and Britain
in particular, have always been fair-
ly pro-Arab. M a n y of their heads of
state were educated in British pub-
lic schools, and British diplomats
can usually expect w a r m hand-
shakes from Arab hands. Israel, on
the other hand, was created in the
wake of the Second W o r l d War,
depending then, as it does now, on
U.S. support for its survival (until
recently, every state bordering on it
had an agreement to exterminate it
if at all possible). The U . S .
Government in turn benefits greatly
from the support of the powerful
Jewish lobby. By such things are
foreign policy decided. So w h e n
C o o k talks of Britain and Europe
taking a larger role, it can only
mean bad news for Israel, as far as
Netanyahu can work out. Even
though Britain supported the U.S.
is its stance against Iraq and
S a d d a m Hussein, one of Israel's
greatest foes in m o d e r n times,
Israel fundamentally distrusts
Britain. If even the United States,
w h o is undoubtedly the N o . 1
Peacebroker in the region cannot
presently navigate its way to a deal,
Britain's infinitely weaker foreign
policy strength doesn't stand a
chance.
The biggest barrier it seems is
Binyamin Netanyahu himself. King
Hussein of Jordan wrote to him a
year ago asking him why 'he was
out to destroy everything he'd
worked for in his life'. Netanyahu
continues to have settlements built
in what is clearly on the Palestinian
side of the line. M o s t observers feel
that Netanyahu has torn up the
entire process and imposed his
own view on Israeli sovereignty to
the area. H e will probably have to
go for a solution to be achieved.
The greater worry o n our Prime
Minister's mind will be his own
impending tour to the region. Blair
is at his best dispensing kind words
and platitudes, smoothing ruffled
feathers and nurturing egos. Cook's
recent legacy could leave Biair in a
hard d i p l o m a t i c position. O n e
hopes for Cook's sake that Blair is
not m a d e a fool of, for then Cook's
position in the Foreign Office will
be increasingly untenable.
