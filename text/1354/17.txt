A bucketful of Fake Tan
with David Hasselhoff
...and a drawer full of lube. he end of the Hoﬀ-era draws near. Enjoy.
If you’ve been reading Coﬀee Break all year, and let’s face it, you should have – then you’ll
be aware of our FUCWIT competition. Here’s what we’ll be giving away.
Massive FUCWIT Update
1st 2nd 3rd 1-5 6-15
The winners will be receiving this
lovely Chocolate Fountain, guar-
anteed to send the ladies of the
Computing department all-a-quiver.
Second prize is this cool looking laser
game - if you shoot your opponent,
they get a genuine shock. Not suit-
able for pregnant women or pussies.
A chance to relive your youth if you
come third - you could win this lovely
Space Hopper. It’s good for exercise,
and you need some, tubby.
The top five teams all receive a crate
of beer. Why not enjoy it German-
style and get yourself leder-hosened
up, just like these chaps?
The next ten teams all get a small
pack of beer. This is more suited to
the lightweights amongst you. Maybe
you could share it with your nan?

Important!
As you may or may not be aware,
there are only two issues left this
year, after this one. The Hoff’s time
is coming to a close now, and with
it the FUCWIT competition. Next
week will be the last FUCWIT thing,
and as such, it’s a special one. Pay
attention:
Next week is a treasure hunt of
sorts. We’ll explain it in more detail
in next weeks Felix - but there’s a
few things you’ll need to know. You
can only enter on Thursday and
Friday as we’ll need to the weekend
to sort out the prizes and stuff. This
means you need to be quick! We’re
going to need you to prove that
you’ve found these things by taking
a photo of yourself with them, so
you’ll also need a camera. Just a
phone one will do though.
If you’re pretty low in the table
this is your chance to catch up, as
we’ll be giving away loads of points.
He drinks like a ﬁsh and he smells like a skip, but for some strange reason, the ladies love
him and the boys want to touch him. It’s time for some inspirational words from he Man.
David Hasselhoff’s Hairy Chest
Hello Students. It’s been a while
since we’ve spoke, what with the
new girl Buttercup fagging up the
office. The place no longer
has my familiar musky
smell, thanks to the half-
a-dozen Glade Plug-ins
that she’s whacked into
every available socket.
The place couldn’t
possibly be any
more summery
or meadowy.
I’ve also
been busy
with some
of my
extra-cur-
r i c u l a r
activities.
Some of you may have befriended
me on that Facebook thing. I have to
say it’s pretty disappointing that the
majority of people are blokes trying
to claim ‘we hooked up’.
Facebook is more homo-erotic than
spending a weekend camping with
the Rugby team. I dread to think how
many of you are getting off on these
very words, clutching the paper in
your sweaty hands, as you enjoy a
private moment with Felix. It makes
a change from the amount of people
who use Page 3 for their wank-bank.
Surely there comes a point when you
must realise that there is something
wrong with you and surely that point
comes when your wastepaper bin is
full of ‘used’ copies of Felix and you
catch sight of yourself in the mirror,
limp, drained, and with ink stains
around your rapidly fading Johnson.
With so many of you getting off on
the thought of my manly hairy chest,
and so many of you getting off on the
hairy chests on Page 3, I’m beginning
to notice a theme. Some of you are
seriously repressed.
Many times I have pondered on the
state of Imperial Boys whilst plowing
away on whichever tart I happen to
be poking at that time (It helps me
last longer to think of you lot). Maybe
you aren’t so useless with women
after all. Maybe the real reason is
that you are all Gay.
Now listen, I am perfectly fine with
you being homosexual. I’m a modern
guy. I mean look at me, look at my fine
curly hair, I am clearly in touch with
my feminine side. It could be argued
that I was the first Metrosexual.
Anyway, the more of you that are gay,
the more minge there is for the rest
of us. Anything that makes it easy
for me to get my end away is okay
by me.
It shouldn’t really come as surprise
to you all. As well as myself, there’s
The Rector, who is clearly a Gay Icon.
Just look into those eyes and swoon,
fellas! London also has a thriving
scene, and in fact, I’m beginning to
think there are plenty of advantages
to being Gay At Imperial.
For a start, you no longer have to
do all this needle in a haystack bulls-
hit with trying to find a decent bit of
fanny. You can’t go anywhere without
bumping into a bit of cock. You no
longer have to pretend to understand
football. Girls also tend to be more
comfortable with Lance The Modern
Man than they are with Dave The
Muff Master.
I think it’s time
to bring this col-
umn to a close.
If you’ve got any
comments then
just use the regu-
lar email address.
I promise to read
them all.
And then laugh
and delete them
of course.
