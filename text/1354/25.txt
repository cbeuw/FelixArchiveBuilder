After a recent good run by IC 1sts
their spirits were running high into
their biggest match of the season.
With the recent dispatch of their
previous Stinky captain to foreign
parts, Batty had been left in charge to
ensure the Medics got a good beating.
And that he did with great success.
With earlier talks by Jezzer saying
that we were 'gonna beat them psy-
chologically' he was obviously up for
the job. The psychology worked, leav-
ing the Medics to attempt to warm up
at the Fortress for hours beforehand.
Meanwhile the Imperial 1sts had the
sense to arrive at the pitch just as
the whistle was blown, avoiding the
icy (IC) wind and barren conditions
for as long as possible. IC's Batty
captain arrived just seconds before
pushback, having decided a casual
drive to Reading and back would be
the perfect warm up.
A rousing call of "1,2,3 Fortress" in
the huddle obviously had the right
effect, as despite having nine short
corners the 'scum' could only con-
vert one, and soon ran out of ideas
when they realised their fabled drag
flicker could not put the ball past an
inspired and often airborne Apu in
the IC goal. If only he hadn't been so
polite, always inviting them to "please
come again" he may have been up
for the 'Best Visual Effects' award in
Hollywood next month. Even in open
play the pansies couldn't force their
way through the brick wall that was
the IC Central defence of Date Rape
and Mountie.
Confusion and panic swept through
the IC ranks midway through the first
half as Blue leader, Flight Lueitenant
Star Wars appeared to desert his
comrades mid-battle. Little did we
know it was all a cunning strategy to
catch the opposition unaware, as Star
Wars light jumped his x-wing back
into the fray, lazers blazing trium-
phantly as the young padawan fired
home another IC goal.
The right wing attack combined
Harvester with the slippery skills of
Toadfish. Although some tackles from
Harvester were on the agricultural
side, he ploughed down the flank and
sowed the seeds for the IC forwards
to reap the rewards.
Toadfish in the midfield took an ill-
deserved and obscene ramming from
his ULU chums, but still seemed to
be having a whale of a time school-
ing the scum on how to drag-flick.
Perhaps it was something Date Rape
slipped into the oppo's half-time
drinks but he certainly managed to
take out a few of the ULU boys with
his rock-solid tackle throughout the
second half. And we all thought he
had a girlfriend?!
With Crusty clowning around and
Phlegm sticking it in yet another
medic, the IC attack quashed the
scum resolve. Both snatched well
taken goals, though the actual intent
of Phlegm's 15-yard loop-deflection
must be brought into question.
Cometh the shortie, cometh the
Drag-Queen, but even Max had to
stand and watch as Toadfish har-
pooned the ball into the medic goal,
leaving the scum keeper flapping
around like a fish out of water. In
attempting to find his hat-trick and
deserved messy-pint, Toadfish decid-
ed the scum deserved a mid-match
taster course in open-heart surgery
when he proceded to sling another
vicious drag-flick into the chest of a
marauding medic defender, re-creat-
ing a scene similar to the opening
of Saving Private Ryan. The conse-
quence was that the medic pulled his
heart-string and the remnants of the
medic team followed suit soon after.
In conclusion, it’s a good thing
they're all medics (if ever that can
be a good thing?), cos its gonna take
some serious surgery to repair the
wounds inflicted on that fateful day at
The Fortress!
One medic scum summarised in
confidence to Stinky:
"The buggers won 5-2. We played
like chumps, converted 1/9 shorties
and leaked like a sieve. Gay. Also
Lander drag-flicked 2 into the net
and 1 into my chest." Yes Mr medic,
gay indeed.

Ultimate Frisbee is a game played
between two teams of seven play-
ers, using one disc (more commonly
known as a frisbee). Each team tries
to obtain, and then maintain, posses-
sion of the disc by passing it between
team-mates, so that they can score
by catching the disc in the opponents’
endzone. It is a non-contact sport,
and players cannot run with the disc.
Last Saturday KCL and Imperial’s
Ultimate Frisbee clubs joined forces
to create the mixed team “Flump”,
to compete at a national mixed tour-
nament. 36 teams travelled from
across Britain to compete, and some
of the best players in Europe were in
action.
Basic stands for “Brunel and
Southampton in Conjuction” – sorry
to disappoint all you computer types,
but it’s not the language sometimes
preceded by “Visual”. They entered
two teams into this tournament,
and split their teams evenly. Both
Brunel and Southampton have very
strong Uni teams, and they domi-
nated the game from the beginning.
Their strong handlers were able to
fire off a worrying number of dan-
gerous break-force throws, and their
zone defence was equally strong in
the wind. We succeeded in break-
ing through once, with impressive
cutting by Liza for our first score.
Particular comedy moments included
three pick calls (a type of obstruction
foul) by Basic’s JJ in our endzone,
and stinging horizontal hail stones
that sent substitutes sprinting for any
shelter they could find.
After a long break, and the arrival
of “Mental” Gaz, we played against
Ealing’s ultimate team. The game
was characterised by “huck-and-D”
(i.e. playing for yards, or simply huck-
ing downwind and hoping the opposi-
tion turnover near their endzone).
They caught a slight early lead, but
a switch from zone-D to a straight-
up force did the trick, and the game
was very close for a long time. Our
lack of experience of playing together
showed through in the later stages,
and the Herd managed to grab a cou-
ple of critical upwind points.
We went into this a bit too excited
from the game before, and failed to
adapt our style of play. The winds
were gradually getting stronger (as if
they weren’t strong enough anway),
huck-and-D failed to work, and we
turned the disc over too often close
to our endzone. One highlight which
has to be mentioned was Amy’s first
layout – she didn’t managed to get
the disc, but it was a valiant effort
for someone who’s been playing for
less than two months, and who had
never played a proper match before.
It was the most excited I’d seen Sam
all weekend!
After showering in the dodgiest
showers in London we headed off to
the “Dutch House” pub for the tour
party. Only one other team showed-
up, but the friendly staff, cheap food,
cheap drink, good company, and com-
edy selection of late 80’s and early
90’s cheese made-up for it. It turns
out most teams decided to go home
and watch Eurovision instead.
Frisbee-tacular!

Discuits 2 were the highest-seeded
team we’d play all weekend so we
knew it would be tough. Though their
handling wasn’t special, they had a
couple of very fast receivers, and
took an early 6-0 lead. We had a mini-
comeback which scared Discuits, but
they soon regained their composure,
and put real pressure on our handlers
with their junk-zone-D. The game was
slightly marred by Discuits’ unsports-
manlike behaviour.
We started seeded 33 out of 36, and
ended 35. We didn’t really mind the
shocking weather, but we did mind
missing out on 2 more games because
a team pulled out at the last minute,
and the UK Ultimate Association
decided it was more important for
higher seeded-team to have a full
set of games than for lower teams to
have a full set of games, despite us all
paying the same entry fee.
