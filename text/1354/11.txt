Letters to the editor
Chicken skewers
Dear Editor,
I would like to express my outrage at
the new food vending machines that
were recently placed in the JCR.
Just today I purchased “Chicken
Skewers” and found that they were
unsatisfactory in every way. I have
a number of points that I want to
make about the system and the food
themselves.
1. The Cost – The the chicken
skewers cost £2 which is quite
expensive under any circumstance
however especially when they are
compared with the £1.76 baguettes
offered by the Tiki Café.
2. When I actually purchased the
food they got stuck in the machine
and to enable them to be removed
the box was squashed beyond repair.
This is not an irregular occurrence
as I have seen on a number of occa-
sions the same thing happening with
the machines.
3. I then chose to have them
heated. Following the instructions I
placed them in the microwave and
pressed start. Indeed a quick 30
seconds later I removed the food.
This was where the real problems
started.
a. The box had started too disinte-
grated.
b. Then I opened the box and to
my dismay I found 3 “tiny” pieces
of chicken. The combined weight
of which could not have been more
then the weight of the money I paid

Biomedical
Sciences closures
Felix and, more importantly, the staff
concerned remain totally unware
what the future holds for Biomedical
Sciences at Imperial.
When we asked College to provide
us with full details of the planned
closures and job cuts, we were only
told that College “are protecting
the teaching…students and facili-
ties will not be affected”. There was
no mention as to the job security of
those employed in the BMS division.
Felix is the students’ newspaper, but
it is read by most staff members at
Imperial.
We understand the staff will be
informed of the decision today. Felix
hopes that College has the sense to
treat its employees with the respect
they deserve.

Lax security in
College, again
Despite College focusing heav-
ily on security concerns, notably
October’s dress code, this is the
third lapse in security Felix has
uncovered this year.
On most occasions we gained
access to forbidden areas by simply
tailgaiting others through resticted
doors. Staff and students need to
be aware of those around them and
not hold doors open for people they
don’t know.
Even though we may not have
accessed any highly classified
areas, it still brings into question
the security of this campus. Given
a bit more time and effort, we are
sure we could have gained access
to even more restricted areas.
for them.
c. The appearance of the chicken
was nothing that would inspire you
to eat it - in fact it wouldn’t be wrong
to say that it was just revolting.
d. Then to top it all the food wasn’t
even what could be considered
remotely warm.
e. When I actually tried some of
the chicken it was horrible and had
no flavour, the best part was the
sauce provided.
I tried this food to see what I
thought I would be eating come
exam time as it has been tipped as
being the food available 24 hours a
day during the exams. If I had an
exam any time soon I would have
been very hesitant to even think
about eating it due to any possible
medical repercussions. I do think
that the idea was good however I
just feel that the action undertaken
was very poor and something needs
to be done.

Please & thank you go a
long way
Dear Felix,
Forgive me for being a nag but I just
find it amazing and unbelieveable how
rude people can be when they don't
say "please" or "thank you". I found
this quite a trend when I was help-
ing out with Medical OSCE exams
recently, where not one even said
"please" or "thank you" to the helper
who was going to hand them the nee-
dles and gloves. Furthermore, when
lending pens, I find them handed
back to me without a word of appre-
ciation. I am quite compelled to stop
being generous when I don't hear a
he author of the Star Letter received each week wins £10
We want to hear your views

word of please.
You'll find it quite amazing how a
little appreciation for our fellow stu-
dents can go a long way and make
everyone's day so much better, con-
sidering its rarity nowadays.
yours,

Public transport horror
Dear Felix,
Why is public transport so bad? My
parents live in a hilly little place not
so far from Manchester. Ordinarily
I would get the wonderful Virgin
pendolino train from Euston (which
makes me feel less bad about the
price of the ticket), but the main
line was closed this weekend, to my
dismay. The National Rail website
told me to get a train to Nottingham
(or Sheffield) from St. Pancras. This
doubled my journey time from a
bearable 2 hours to more than 4.
The last step of the journey
involved me using (gasp) a bus.
Growing up in Saddleworth has pre-
pared me well for the terrible bus
service, but it has since worsened. It
takes another two hours to travel the
12 miles from Manchester, and these
buses run just once an hour.
Returning to London always
makes me think how much bet-
ter things are here, and it amazes
me that the government (initially)
refused funding for Manchester’s
Metrolink. I wonder whether the
people sitting in Westminster
know what lies beyond the limits of
Greater London.
