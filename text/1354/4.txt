this, he could be sentenced to 165
years in prison and Mr Skilling 185
years. Sentencing will occur on 11th
September.Prosecutorswererelieved
by the verdict despite a lengthy list of
employees and investors who were
certain that the two chief executive
were to blame. Until Thursday’s rul-
ing, no Enron executive had been
convicted of any crimes.
After the verdicts were read out, Mr
Lay’s wife and children sobbed while
huddling around him. Mr Skilling’s
wife did not attend the hearing and
both men vowed to vigorously appeal.
The largest scandal in American cor-
porate history concluded on Thursday
25th May. A climax was reached with
former Enron bosses Kenneth Lay
and Jeff Skilling convicted for con-
spiracy and fraud. This came as a
relief to prosecutors and the govern-
ment, who have been cracking down
hard on white-collar crime over the
past five years. These crimes have
shattered investor confidence, result-
ed in job losses and have cost the US
economy billions of dollars.
The notorious case lasted sixteen
weeks in court, but took only six days
to deliberate. The jury concluded that
Mr Lay and Mr Skilling had deceived
company-shareholders regarding
the true state of the energy-trading
firm. The conviction was not easy
to secure, though, and of the thirty
people charged in connection with
the scandal, prosecutors had to make
deals with over half of them.
Some of the jurors viewed them-
selves as key players in the fight
against corporate irresponsibility and
greed that prompted US lawmakers
to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
new laws have increased the extent
to which executive and directors are
accountable for company actions. At
a news conference, Kath Harrison
– one of the jurors – said, “This is
undoubtedly the most challenging
and heart rendering experience I’ve
ever had, I’ve fought a battle ground
for American justice.”
Mr Skilling was found guilty on
eighteen counts of conspiracy and
fraud but was acquitted from all
but one – insider trading. Mr Lay
was found guilty on six charges and
was also charged on four counts of
bank fraud in a separate case. For

The jurors rejected the two’s defence,
which was different from ordinary
corporate strategies. Usually, execu-
tives accept that fraudulent actions
have taken place but deny personal
responsibility.
In this case, however, it would be
difficult to prove that the such large
fraudulent transactions could have
gone unnoticed by the chief execu-
tive. Instead, the former executives
claimed that the company had been
destroyed by a market panic brought
on by heightened scrutiny of the
media, regulators and analysts. They
Global equity markets endured anoth-
er tough week. Shares in London
and Central Europe were highly
volatile. Emerging market equities
in Russia, India and Indonesia fell
sharply. Investors ploughed money
into US treasuries, which strength-
ened over the week. Fears over infla-
tion are blamed and were heightened
last week with a rise in durable good
ordered and the Federal Open Market
Committee signaling that interest
rates in the US will rise.
Energy was at the top of the agenda
in a Russian-EU summit that took
place in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Russian President Putin attempted
to ease European fears over unstable
energy sources stating Russia, “was,
is and always will be” a reliable sup-
plier to the EU.
OECD is upbeat on the outlook
of the global economy. Despite the
current turmoil in equity markets,
weakening dollar, inflation issues and
spiking commodity prices, the Paris-
based economic think-tank said that
the world’s leading economies are
looking strong in the next quarter.
Euronext, the company that runs
European stock exchanges and the
also claimed that their activities were
not abnormal for tech boom compa-
nies and if any creative accounting
did go on, it was no different from the
money-shuffling policies of similar
firms. One of Mr Lay’s lawyers even
remarked, “when did bankruptcy
become a crime?”
Mr Skilling was granted a bond of
$5 million until sentencing but was
ordered to surrendered his passport
and have his five children put forward
their homes to guarantee the bond. In
the meantime, various hedge funds
and other investment funds have
agreed to buy Enron’s remaining $2.1
billion assets.
Prosecutors hope that this verdict
will satisfy the American people who
view Enron as the symbol of those
who have amassed fortunes through
dubious means. The trial did help
emphasise some home truths regard-
ing American business culture, par-
ticularly with regards to spin. Mr
Lay was a great fan of spin and this
is, of course, sometimes necessary
for marketing within any company.
Problem arose when Mr Lay took
spin to the point of criminal lying.
He lied about company earning, not
only to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, but also to employees
who were told Enron was “going to
hit [its] numbers” when it clearly
was not.
The draconian measures of
Sarbanes-Oxley, seeking to put an
end to corporate fraud and bolster
investor sentiment might, in the end,
do more harm than good to the capital
market of the US. Initial public offer-
ings that would have normally ended
up in New York might now gravitate
towards London and other financial
centres with less stringent rules. The
US is left hoping that Enron is the last
major scandal that will hurt investor
confidence.
