The last 100 years
8 July 2007 is the Collegeʼs 100th
birthday and the date commemorates
“100 years of living science” since the
drawing together of the three 19th
century constituent Colleges - the
Royal School of Mines, the Royal
College of Science and the City and
Guilds College - to form Imperial
College.
The last hundred years has seen
the College expand from a science
college of 600 students (and no
females!) to 11,500 students ,
teaching Engineering, Medicine,
Science, Technology and Business,
with 8 campuses across London and
the South East.
The Future
With Imperial leaving the University
of London, the College will become a
university in its own right. Coupled
with an ambitious redevelopment,
Imperial has an exciting future
ahead.
Centenary Campaign
As part of the Centenary celebrations,
there is a massive fund raising
campaign being run by College. It
aims to raise funds for a number
of ﬂagship projects, including the
Union Building redevelopment,
Centenary Scholarships for students,
redevelopment of the Library,
redevelopments at the Hammersmith
campus, new buildings on Exhibition
Road, Envision 2010 (Engineering)
and a Centre for Risk Management at
the Business School.
The Collegeʼs Oﬃce of Alumni &
Development is leading the fund
raising campaign and is planning
a number of fund raising events at
the College as well as internationally
to raise awareness of Imperialʼs
celebrations.
Union Building
The Union Building has been adopted
as one of the Centenary projects
demonstrating its importance to the
College and meaning that part of
the fund raising campaign will be
for it. Together with the £1.2 million
College have put into the project
already, and the £1.1 million from
the Union, the fund raising campaign
will seek to ﬁnd the rest of the
money required along with help from
College.
As part of the campaign, Trevor
Phillips, the UK Governmentʼs
Commissioner for Racial Equality
and an ex-President of the Union,
came on board this Easter as an
ambassador for the Unionʼs fund
HowYOU or
your CLUB or
SOCIETY can get
involved
Thanks to those who have already
given ideas for events and
memorabilia, many of which have
been incorporated into plans by
the Centenary Project Team.
If your Club or Society will be
having an event next year which
youʼd like to incorporate in
the Collegeʼs 100th birthday
celebrations or in the fund raising
for the student projects, contact
centenary@imperial.ac.uk and
president@imperial.ac.uk.
Centenary events will be
publicised through the Centenary
website, which will be launched
later this term, and you will be
able to use the newly developed
Centenary logo and strap line you
may even get the Rector and
other famous college alumni
giving the opening speech at
your event!
Further information about holding
centenary events will be published
on the centenary website shortly.
“Some of the best moments in my
life happened in and around the
Beit Quad and in the Union Building
- from becoming President of the
Union, to my ﬁrst brush with the
media.. to learning how to drink a
yard of ale, through to stuff that
no-one but me and the others
involved need to know about. The
redevelopment wonʼt
just be an asset to
the College. It will
be essential to both
preserving and updating
the best in student life”.
Trevor Phillips OBE
What will happen during the
Centenary?
During the year there will be lots
of events going on including Guest
Lectures, Exhibitions, birthday
celebrations and the opening of a
number of College developments,
including the new Southside Halls of
Residence. Student events will be
incorporated, such as the New Yearʼs
parade to kick off the centenary year
in style. An events programme will
be published in the Autumn of 2006
and will be available to all students.
There will also be memorabilia
available to celebrate the year,
available in the Union Shop and
online, as well as a celebratory DVD
and a book mapping the history of
the College by Dr Hannah Gay.
A free gift will also be given to all
students as a memorabilia of this
special occasion for students.
How Alumni can get involved
As part of the Collegeʼs centenary
campaign, alumni will be asked to
consider making a gift to one of
three areas: student support, the
library and the Imperial College
Union refurbishment. Donations
from alumni, staff and friends are
extremely important to the College
and itʼs encouraging to see the
increase in support each year. Over
the last three years, more than 1,500
alumni have made more than 4,000
gifts amounting to over £325,000
to the Student Opportunities Fund,
a College-wide scholarship fund
designed to support students who
may not otherwise be able to afford
to take up their course at Imperial.
For more information about any of
the Collegeʼs fund raising activities,
please contact the oﬃce of Alumni
and Development
(supporting@imperial.ac.uk).
