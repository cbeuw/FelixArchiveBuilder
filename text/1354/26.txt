Cryptic Crossword 1354 Rawden
Swimming and Water Polo at Imperial
College is undergoing something of
a revival. The club’s fortunes have
changed a great deal since the start
of the year when it was divided and
orphaned, struggling to find tempo-
rary homes after being ousted from
the sports centre. Now training takes
part three times a week in the plush
surrounds of Ethos. Managed by a
determined committee, the club has
grown from strength to strength.
The skeptic may ask in what ways.
To start, members have responded
enthusiastically. Though free swim-
ming was available, they voted with
their feet to take part in club-only ses-
sions instead. Numbers have doubled
with alumni returning to train and
help as skills dictated. Senior club
members have volunteered to coach,
with noticeable results.
“This year we
invaded the ACC
Dinner with the
largest turnout
of any club.“
Importantly, the new pool has
allowed swimming and water polo to
be reunited. Training times overlap
with evident benefits to fitness, tech-
nique and camaraderie. Team spirit
has been strengthened through fund-
raising ventures (Swim for Malaria/
BT Swimathon) and rampageous
social events. This year we invaded
the ACC Dinner with the largest turn-
out of any club.
In the club’s second year of IC
representation at BUSA, attendance
in individual short and long course
swim events has grown impres-

sively. Achievements out of the pool
have also been remarkable. Sakura
Hingley and Sophie Mitchinson had
successful Channel crossings, with
Sophie breaking the magic 10 hour
mark. In doing so, she became the
fastest UK swimmer of 2005. As this
goes to press, others are in prepara-
tion for similar attempts this year.
In keeping with the cold water
theme, we welcome Lewis Pugh,
or more properly the Ice Bear, to
Presidency of the club. Over the
last twenty years, he has pioneered
extreme cold water swimming and
has a keen scientific interest in the
subject, collaborating with a number
of leading physiologists. We look for-
ward to a lecture on his experiences
in the near future.
Water polo has built on lessons
from the IDEA League held in
Zurich last year. This year the team
narrowly missed first place in the
London League, but won the inter-
collegiate competition held at Ethos
in April. We have contributed person-
nel to the ULU Men’s Water Polo
Team who were BUSA champions
this year. In addition, Imperial play-

Finally, the club has embraced cor-
porate opportunities with gusto. We
have been helped by The Duke of
York pub and are negotiating with the
new Harrington’s Bar. Strong brand-
ing has been developed through spon-
sorship and guidance from Frutina (a
sports nutrition company) and swim
kit from Sport and Leisure. We are
very grateful to all of the above and
the Union for their ongoing support.
What can we expect from the club in
the future? In the short term, a sum-
mer tour to Croatia is planned where
local teams renowned for their water
polo abilities will be challenged. A
swim-tour of London’s lidos has been
arranged to raise funds for this.
In the long term, we have only to
look at the club’s ambitious mani-
festo: a development scheme that will
raise standards to those of universi-
ties competing in the upper third of
BUSA. In doing so, water polo will
represent the College alone. It is
clear that the gains made this year
were predominantly related to the
amount of training time and quality of
coaching. For these needs to be met,
it is vital that internal and external
support is fostered.
The club’s progress has been
encouraging and members are look-
ing forward to next year, assured that
the pattern is set to continue. With
the relevant bricks and mortar in
place, it only remains to be seen if IC
Swimming and Water Polo can do its
new pool justice.
