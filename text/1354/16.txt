Wales largest, wildest and award
winning outdoor dance festival
returns June 17th for its 7th year
running. With the likes of Goldie
Lookin' Chain, Mylo and The
Shapeshifters gracing the main
stage, plus a star studded line-up
hitting the decks across 5 arenas,
catering for all your dance tastes,
this year is sure to keep the char-
acteristic awesomeness that is
Escape Into The Park.
Over 20,000 summer loving
festival heads will descend upon
Swansea's Singleton Park with it's
scenic backdrop, to enjoy the very
best of today’s dance music. With
sets spanning from the pound-
ing beats of the likes of Eddie
Halliwell, Mixmag's two time
crowned “World Number One
Dj”. To the Turntablist sounds
of the Scratch Perverts mixing
it up in the Urban Arena, right
through to downright dirty Drum
n Bass, with a Dj set from Planet
Pendulum, followed by Radio
One's Fabio and Grooverider in
the Raveology Arena, to keep
you buzzing hard into the night.
Radio One will be joining the eve-
nings delights on their own stage,
boasting the Netherlands Armin
Van Buuren. He is sure to be
one of my personal highlights of
the night, ranked at no. 3 in the
public-voted DJ Top 100, he is one
of the leading lights in the genre
and the atmosphere is sure to be
alive and electric, guaranteed to
put you into a State of Trance.
Simply unmissable.
Now for a little peek at the main
stage, which is throwing out a
whole host of stars over the day.
Headlining will be Wales very
own track-suit clad super stars,
who need absolutely no introduc-
ing. Yes, Goldie Lookin' Chain,
will be entertaining us all in their
oh so unique style. I've seen them
a few times before and they get
better everytime, here's what
they have to say;
“This summer will see the sec-
ond coming of love. We’re more
than overjoyed to be appearing
at this year’s Escape in the Park
event. Not only for the amaz-
ing women and tearing party
atmosphere, but because we get
to party in Wales and also get
to stay at the Pantycelyn guest-
house on Oyster Mouth road. We
also want to see sixty thousand
ravers on the beach at 5am, just
like Ibiza, but with better pubs.”
A brief recap, yes there will be
“amazing women” a “tearing
party atmosphere”, and world
class acts for 12 jam packed
hours. How can you not come
now?
Also on the Main stage, yet
from slightly further afield than
Newport (Washington DC in
fact), the incredible, Grammy
winning Iranian-American House
duo Deep Dish will be leading
up to Goldie Lookin' Chain. A
mash up of various genres into
their very own deep house sound,
makes Deep Dish stand out in the
crowd as an original and hugely
popular act. They've gone from
strength to strength since their
amazing debut album in 1998, a
definite one to see.
As well as the non-stop music
there will be other attractions
throughout the day, notably a
selection of white-knuckle thrill
rides, dazzling displays, dancers
and Karaoke if you feel the urge
and/or are really drunk.
Having only mentioned a few of
the world class artists perform-
ing (and very briefly at that) I feel
guilty for leaving this preview of
what is going to be a truly class
A, 12 hours of musical madness
here. All I can do is urge you to
enter the competition, win the
tickets and rock on down and
join the party, what better way is
there to end the exam season?
Email in to nightlife telling me why you
should win two tickets to Escape. Then
you might !

Considering I have exams tomor-
row, I’ve decided to spend the time
I have left for revision making a
two page spread for Felix. Oh well.
This week we’ve got a super spe-
cial competition giveaway for two
tickets to the biggest dance music
festival in the UK, Escape Into The
Park in Swansea, the line-up looks
pretty good, so good in fact that
I may go there myself (purely for
journalistic purposes) and check
it out. Simon has kindly written us
a preview on the event and after
hours of research has created the
masterpiece you can see to the
left.
In other matters, Conor has writ-
ten us another review. Don’t you
have a job or work or something?
This time its of sometng a little
more suited to student budgets,
the Notting Hill Arts Club on a
Norwegian invasion night, good
End of term is fast approaching, no more work?
We’re all doomed!
stuff as usual and great outfits, as
expected.
Finally, the lovely Alex has been
kind enough to document our night
out to Plastic People to check out
what replaced And Did We Mention
Our Disco. All I can say is that the
new club night Lost was absolutely
awful, and possibly ranks as one
of the worst nights I’ve ever had
the misfortune to visit. Good work
Plastic People in replacing a sell-
out club night with something that
attracted about 15 people.
Remember to enter the competi-
tion this week to win tickets for
Escape Into The Park, if nobody
does, well you can guess who will
get the free tickets. Yep, my mum.
Next week the competition will be
tickets to Get Loaded In The Park.
You should definately enter for
those tickets, its in London so you
won’t even have to move very far
from college, which I assume you
will all be hanging about during the
holidays, considering how amazing
it is here (I will be).
For upcoming reviews, a brave
reviewer has volenteered to visit 5
clubs in 5 concecutive nights. I will
only attatch one rule to that, mini-
mum 20 alcohol units per night.
We’re also still looking for more
volenteers, so I’ll use the rest of
the space in my column to try to
convince you to write things for us.
Please write for us, or Conor and
Michael will invade the whole of
Felix! (Not that I would mind). I’m
not sure I understand why I all-
ways hear complaints from people
telling me how expensive the union
is for drinks, when I offer them free
drinks they refuse!
