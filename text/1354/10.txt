Shag, Marry, Shoot?
Here at Felix we know you’re all gagging for a bit of action. Come on, you do go to Imperial so it’s probably been at least
a few months. If ever. It’s a known fact that guys walk around playing Shotgun, calling ‘dibs’ on the hottest girls in sight.
In the case of the Computer Scientists, they’re just calling ‘dibs’ on any female-shaped blur they can see with their com-
puter monitor-damaged eyes, in the hopes that she’s over the age of 16 and is attractive by Department of Computing
standards. And don’t call us sexist – we know girls play too. Their version isn’t quite so crude – they claim to think about
‘having someone’s babies’ (which we all know is code for ‘banging senseless’). So we thought we’d join in.
Each week Felix will ask a jury of the cooler IC students who they’d shag, who they would marry, and who they would
shoot:

This is a puzzle similar to
sudoku, you will notice that
some rows and columns will
duplicate a number. The aim
is to colour in cells so that
an individual number never
appears more than once in a
particular row or column
The cells that you colour
in must never be adjacent
to each other horizontally or
vertically
All the cells that are left
uncoloured (in their original
state) must join together to
form a single area.

“I’d shoot Matthews
because he’s a Sci-fi
geek and he takes up
our space! I’d shag
Sameena and then I
could sell the story
and I guess I’d marry
the other one, she’s
the only one I’ve
met.”
Shazia:
“I can’t shag any
of them, they’re girls
and he’s questionable
but if I had to I would
shag Sarah, marry
Simon and shoot
Sameena.”
Hannah:
Took one look at
the pictures and fled
in disgust!
Alex:
“I’d shag Sameena
and Simon, then
shoot him after-
wards! And marry
Sarah.”
Gareth:
“Can I shoot them
all? Who are they
anyway?”
Mariko:
“I’d shag Sarah,
shoot Simon and
marry Sameena.”

Rover Editorial
Welcome to the first edition of Rover, the new Felix pullout. We’re starting off with our weekly game of ‘Shag, Marry,
Shoot?’, to give Imperial College students the chance to at least think about who they’d rather get it on with!
On a more serious note, we have an interview with Paul Rusesabagina, the inspiration behind the true to life film,
Hotel Rwanda, and an expose on the Tanaka Business School donation scandal.
Whatever you think about Tanaka’s motives for donating the money to College, it is important that we know
whether or not Imperial College has actually received the £27m promised by Gary Tanaka - a fact which Sir Richard
Sykes is keeping very secret indeed.
This is potentially a very hefty deficit in the College budget, and it is a known fact that some ‘donations’ by Tanaka’s
business partner Alberto Vilar were never paid, leaving some organisations in financial difficulty.
If you’ve loved this week’s issue but think you can make it better or just want to comment on the articles you have
read, then please contact us!
