Eurotrip
Darlings, as summer approach-
es, it’s time to make travel
plans. For those of us who
have blown our summer
budget already there are only
2 options... Blackpool pier or
Inter-railing. For only £140
you can cart yourself around
Europe, staying in hostel after
hostel with nothing to worry
about except your next feed.
We’ve sampled some of the culi-
nary delights, tried on some of
the outfits and visited some of
the brothels so you know exactly
what to expect on the continent.
Bon appetit!
Russia: when you get here make sure you
drink vodka, eat caviar and sample Russia's
most famous export, Anna Kournikova. Just
don’t mention the Cold War. Or communism. Or
democracy. ...
Germany:probablyhastheworstfoodin Europe,
such as Sauerkraut and sausages, however,
come in September to celebrate Oktoberfest.
Berlin is famous for its inventive and ground-
breaking architecture, but the young people are
depressed, wear a lot of eyeliner (boys included)
and speak better English than you!
Greece and Turkey: the women are kebab-munch-
ing nutters who like to bleach their hair and wear
skimpy tops. Greeks are famous for their beauty,
and the country is steeped in ancient civilisation.
Turkey has its own appeal; full of shisha, beauti-
ful rugs and buildings and belly dancers! All of the
inhabitants have terrible dress sense but at least
their country has the best food in Europe. Feta
cheese, olives, moussaka and a nice kebab. Just
don’t mention Cyprus!
Sweden: home of the most
beautiful Europeans, apart
from old, horny Sven. Their diet
of saffrom bread and meatballs
give them their air of mystery.
(Why are they so good looking
when they eat shit food?)
Scotland: depending on where
you go you could have a nice time.
Edinburgh is considered to be
one of the most beautiful cities
in the world, home of the famous
Fringe Festival. We dare you to
try a haggis! (Sheep’s intestines,
for the uninformed)
Spain: if you like girls with side-
burns and a semi-professional
attitude towards hygiene, then
this country is for you. Tapas is
basically a foreign buffet mas-
querading as an exotic proper
meal. Look out for dodgy pael-
la, holidaying Brits and sexy
flamenco dancers.
Holland: home of clogs, cannabis, wind-
mills, tulips and whores. Need I say
more? Just don't expect to remember
any of the trip. Red is the colour to wear.
France: definitely the best dressed nation.
However, the women don't shave their arm-
pits, let alone their unmentionables, and the
men smell of garlic. To have a good time, put
on a beret and try some snails... or perhaps
just visit Calais and catch the ferry back to
Dover!
Italy: hot women and even hot-
ter men. Don't come here in the
hope that you'll ever pull any-
one, because everyone else is
just so much better looking than
you. Wear very little clothing and
shout a lot. Eat pasta, be merry
and don’t forget to go visit all
the famous sites like the leaning
tower and the Colosseum
England: very notable
for it's unique social
mix of chavs, fish and
chips, and of course
Felix. Beware of happy
slappers - it's the new
craze for poor people.
