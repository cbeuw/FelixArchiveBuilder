The Division of Biomedical Sciences
(BMS) is facing potential closure this
week, with expected job cuts and staff
relocation of teaching and support
workers at the Sir Alexander Fleming
Building (SAF).
Representatives from College
and members of the Association of
University Teachers (AUT) will be
discussing the future of the BMS
division on Thursday 1 June at the
Academic Joint Staff Committee
meeting.
The Faculty of Natural Sciences
announced the instigation of a thor-
ough review into the division in April,
aiming to develop a long-term plan to
continue Imperial’s medical science
teaching.
Closure of the division was believed
to have a direct impact upon first
and second year medical students,
who rely on such teaching to comple-

Jobs under threat
Future of Biomedical Sciences Division left in the balance
ment the early stages of their medi-
cal training.
A worried BMS research associ-
ate working at the SAF told Felix:
“More people here are worried about
their jobs than who’s going to teach
the medical students. The morale is
plummeting.
“We used to be part of the Imperial
College School of Medicine (ICSM)
but were moved into the Faculty of
Life Sciences. There was a £1.7 mil-
lion deficit and the ICSM would not
pay for teaching; who are they intend-
ing to get to do it in the future?”
Sir Peter Knight, Faculty Principal,
previously told staff that the finan-
cial state of the BMS division was
unsustainable and their position was
untenable. Deficits of over £507,000
were recorded for the financial
year 2005/2006 and projections for
2006/2007 show a deficit of over £1.4
million on a turnover of £1.6 million.
Felix took these points to a College
spokesman, who responded: “The
College’s duty is to strengthen and
College security flaws
Security at the Faculty Building, hub
of College academic management
and workplace of the Rector, has been
exposed as inadequate and ineffec-
tive in light of a Felix investigation.
Felix reporters were able to enter
the ‘restricted’ building on two sepa-
rate occasions and were not chal-
lenged over their identity, whether
they were in fact members of
College or their purpose for entering
Imperial’s administrative headquar-
ters.
Entry to the building is usually con-
trolled by swipe card entry gates
that allow access to a select group
of College staff; these are adjacent
to a manned security desk at the
entrance of the modern four-storey
building and are the main access
points for all personnel entering and
leaving the Faculty building.
Reporters were waved past the
desk on entry and left to roam freely
around the floors coming within feet
of Sir Richard’s office and mixing
with employees at a nearby coffee
bar.
Empty offices with thousands of
pounds worth of equipment and
confidential documents were all in
potential reach of the reporters.
After spending over 30 minutes in the
building, Felix left and returned an
hour later to be greeted by a different
Chris Miles & Vitali Lazurenko receptionist who also granted access
without confirmation of prior appoint-
ments or identity.
Simon Davies, a first year physicist,
told Felix: “If College can’t keep the
Rector secure, what hope is there for
the student body?”
Samantha Perera, a second year
medical student, said: “Personally I
think far too much money is spent
on security as Imperial College and
the Rector are not high-risk terrorist
targets. The money could be better
spent on improving teaching facili-
ties.”
Concerned with such lapses in
College security, Felix also attempted
to gain access to restricted areas in
the Sir Alexander Fleming Building
(SAF) and Union offices. Once inside
the SAF, we were able to tailgate a
researcher into a restricted access
area without being challenged. We
subsequently had open access to
research labs, some of which con-
tained hazardous chemicals, as well
as expensive microscopy equipment.
Similar breaches occurred in the
Sabbatical offices, where no atten-
tion was paid as reporters passed
the Union reception and into the
unlocked vacant office of Deputy
President (Education and Welfare)
Sarah Khatib. Various valuables were
left unattended in the room, in direct
contravention to advice issued at the

improve its teaching in biomedical
sciences and medicine and to under-
take research at the highest level.
“There are no proposals to change
our medical undergraduate courses
and we are looking forward to intro-
ducing our new Biomedical Science
course and subsequently graduate
entry medical course. Discussions
are continuing and the College will
be communicating with staff again
shortly.”
He added: “It is important to note
that...student teaching and facilities
will not be affected.”
Felix spoke to Emma Smith, a
second year medical student, who
said: “I’m really surprised that
the Biomedical Science Division is
being shut down in such a fashion.
By all accounts, the communication
between senior College figures and
the research associates is unsatisfac-
tory to say the least. I hope this is
resolved satisfactory.”

out being questioned by staff or asked to produce College identity.
