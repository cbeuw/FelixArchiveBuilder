DPFS election result announced
The result for the remaining Union
Sabbatical position, Deputy President
(Finance and Services), was
announced last week after the post
went unfilled following last term’s
spring elections.
Over 800 students cast votes, a
record turnout compared to previous
summers. A close-run race resulted
in Jonathan Matthews winning the
election by 14 votes. Edmund Hunt, in
second place, achieved 302, and third-
place candidate Daniel Chowdhury
took116.RON(Re-openNominations)
came last with 91 votes.
Jonathan Matthews will join ICU
President elect John Collins and
future Deputy Presidents Ben Harris,
Eric Lai and Shama Rahman, as well
as Felix Editor elect Andrew Sykes in
next year’s team.
Speaking to Felix, Jonathan
Matthews said: “Obviously I’m abso-
lutely thrilled to have been elected,
especially in such a close result and
very much look forward to the consid-
erable challenges to come, it’s going
to be an interesting year.
“At the risk of this sounding like an
Oscars speech, I'd like to express my
thanks to both other candidates for
making it such a hotly contested but
fair election, especially to Edmund
for coming so close and acting in such
a sportsman-like manner through-
out.”
Mr Matthews states in his mani-
festo: “I will be directly accountable
and ensure I am available to you, not
just hidden in an office.” He will also
“correct the unacceptable increases
in bar and events prices”.
Current ICU President Sameena
Misbahuddin told Felix that she
was delighted with election turnout,
pleased to see passionately fought
campaigns and wished Mr Matthews
the best of luck for next year.
The positions of City and Guilds
College Union President, Council
Chair, CAG Chair and RAG Chair
were also elected, with candidates
James Fok, Daniel McGuiness, Radha
Gadhok and Stephen Brown winning
respectively.
James Fok said: “The faculty union
presidency will be a big post to fill
after the previous leaderships of John
and Sid. I look forward to improv-
ing the unity of the engineers in the
upcoming college centenary with bet-
ter communications and events.”

Welsh Society launched at Imperial
Imperial College Union has recently
approved the formation of a Welsh
Society. The society unofficially
formed on 1 March, St David’s Day, a
symbolic date in the Welsh Calendar.
Although the proposal to form
the society had been in the pipeline
for months, the idea to coincide the
launch with the beginning of March

Jonathan Matthews: Future DPFS
came from a most unlikely source:
each year, Marie Curie’s Cancer
Relief launch their daffodil appeal on
St David’s Day, and the founders took
inspiration and informally discussed
plans for an official Union society.
This was seen as a great opportu-
nity to support a worthy cause. The
group received official confirmation
at the beginning of the month and
have since organised several events
and recruited a sizable proportion of
Imperial’s Welsh contingent.
A member of the society said, “I
think this is a great idea and paves
the way forward for future Scottish
and Irish societies, hopefully bringing
with them the accompanying whisky
and Guinness!”
Although part of the UK, Wales
very much has its own culture and
Welsh Society aims to provide a social
group for Welsh Students. Gabrielle
Thomas, President of the Welsh
Society told Felix: “I'm delighted that
we have been able to form such a
society at Imperial College. We are
here to welcome our fellow Welsh
students, but also to provide a learn-
ing opportunity for those interested
in Welsh culture and language.”
Her thoughts were echoed by
Simon Matthews, Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies): “It is great to
see the regeneration of the Welsh
society after so many years. It is the
first time for a long while that the
Union has had a society representing
any of the home nations and hopefully
there will soon be more,” he said.
Events planned for next term
include a trip to Snowdonia, Union
bar nights (namely one to finally
mark St David’s day!), a Six Nations
get-together, as well as guest lectures
and discussions on Welsh current
affairs.
