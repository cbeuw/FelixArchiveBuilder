The exhibition was divided into
nine dimly lit galleries which the visi-
tor had to pass through in sequential
order. Starting with the bare bones,
the body is gradually built up by add-
ing various body systems. The dis-
plays started off relatively tame, with
an array of bones scattered across
a few exhibition tables, and a famil-
iar-looking skeleton facing visitors
as they entered the first chamber.
Maybe this was to ‘ease’ people into
the experience more than anything,
but still provided me with an oppor-
tunity to show off first-year anatomy,
even if incorrectly.
In the later galleries, the exhib-
its became much more intense. The
bodies were arranged in a variety
of positions, but unlike the previous
Body Worlds, they were more athletic
in contrast to their aesthetic coun-
terparts. I did wonder how they kept
them so immaculately preserved and
thought back to my days in the anat-
omy lab where we had to endure the
sickening smell of formaldehyde the
morning after a night out. In fact, the
bodies had undergone a ‘plastination’
process, during which fluids were
drained and exchanged with plastics
to make the bodies rigid, odourless
and permanently preserved.
Suffice it to say, such preservation
was not used to maintain bodies in a
clinical,‘upright’position.Throughout
the exhibition, bodies were displayed
in various poses ranging from one
man kicking a football to another
playing darts. Not a typical finding in

T
he prospect of
spending my after-
noon looking at dead
bodies at Earl’s
Court was strangely
alluring. This was
not because I have
a bizarre penchant
for necrophilia or enjoy the company
of corpses, but more because I find
the human body truly fascinating and
wanted to see whether I could stretch
my educational muscles further than
spending an afternoon in the Felix
office.
Such eerie thoughts of human pres-
ervation instantly triggered visions of
Gunther von Hagens, TV personality
and anatomist extraordinaire; a per-
son who refuses to shy away from the
cameras or cower from public scru-
tiny. I had vague recollections of his
Channel 4 series last year, where the
hacking away of various body parts
provided a highlight to an otherwise
conventional Thursday evening.
Unfortunately for von Hagens, his
demeanour came across as that of a
‘mad scientist with psychotic tenden-
cies’ rather than that of a ‘humanitar-
ian educator’.
His previous exhibition, Body
Worlds, shocked and fascinated mil-
lions of people around the world. Of
course, it was by no means all sun-
shine and lollipops; the exhibition
caused widespread outcry after some
of the plastinated bodies were found
to have bullet holes in the back of
their heads and led critics to label his
work “a shameless Victorian freak
show”.
With this in mind, I was shocked to
discover that this year’s exhibition
was not the work of von Hagens, but
of an Atlanta-based company who
obtained the bodies from a medi-
cal school in China. The organisers
of the revamped Bodies exhibition
assure us that it has no connection
with the original Body Worlds, but it
has still managed to invite consid-
erable controversy. The organisers
have attracted attention not merely
because of the gratuitous content,
but also because many specimens in
medical schools in China are made
available via unidentified donated
bodies.
It did indeed take guts to go and
see an exhibition like this (excuse the
pun), but none of our group seemed
particularly concerned, and as the
only medic, I felt an obligation to at
least sound as if I knew what I was
talking about.
Eager and inquisitive, we eventually
approached the exhibition centre on
a dreary Wednesday afternoon with
high expectations and a fair share of
animosity; it took about 10 minutes
before we discovered the way in and
then had to navigate past what only
could be described as an aircraft
hangar (the entrance reminded me
of the queue for Space Mountain at
Disney World!). The silence was read-
ily apparent. Reminiscent of a Chapel
of Rest, the people waiting in the
queue were conspicuously respect-
ful, which made the airport-like bag
checks even more peculiar.
One of the
rooms seemed
to shock more
than educate –
babies at
various stages
of development
were curtained
in darkness
and set out in a
similar fashion
to watches on a
jeweller’s table.

discussions over the integrity of the organisers’ intentions. (Photo: Vitali Lazurenko)
