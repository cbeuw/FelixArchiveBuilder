Norwegian fun in Notting Hill
nightlife nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Some of our more observant read-
ers have noticed that over the past
few weeks, the factual content of our
articles has been in rapid decline. No
longer do we dwell on such mundane
items as drink prices, entry times,
or even club locations (apologies to
all who visited 286 King’s Road for
Mamilanji’s. It is in fact 108.) At this
juncture, we feel we must apologise
once more, as something rather spe-
cial happened on Tuesday evening.
We left our Chelsea residence early
on foot, bound for the eclectic Notting
Hill Arts Club, renowned for its under-
ground music showcases and bohe-
mian clientele. Whilst strolling lei-
surely through the opulent surround-
ings of a leafy Kensington Garden
square, we spotted a residents only
Champagne & Smoked Salmon sum-
mer party in full swing.
Ignoring the rather obvious fact
that we were dressed in an antique
silk smoking jacket and full fencing
attire (plus épée), we walked boldly
up to the gate and stated merrily that
we had just moved in to number 37b
(We later found out there were only 35
houses in the square.) One hour, two
bottles of Moët and half the salmon in
Loch Lomond later, we had acquired
invitations to various parties from
our numerous ‘neighbours’ including
a rather creepy landscape gardener
(who may/may not be queer) who
dwells at number 5.
It suddenly struck us that we had a
job to do, so we respectfully bade the
residents of Vicarage Gate farewell
and staggered on up to Notting Hill.
Within ten minutes we had arrived
at the club (very close to Notting Hill
Gate tube) and with bouncers eyeing
the épée warily, we were escorted
to the manager’s office below. The
club was every bit as ‘arty’ as its
name suggested, one wall bearing
a photographic exhibition, surreal-
ist sculptures dotted about, and a
music showcase comprised entirely
of Norwegian bands (yes, you heard
us correctly, Norwegian). It was upon
further consultation with the man-
agement that we realised the house
was having a Norwegian night, under
the watchful eye of the headliner
(and master of ceremonies) Dr Filth.
Towards the end of the evening (after
several beverages) we enquired of
the good doctor whether his title was
indicative of 6 years at medical school
or a mere PhD. As sensitive journal-
ists, good manners preclude us from
printing his rather brusque reply (I
always thought Cnut was merely a
medieval king).
The music encompassed a wide

range of styles and moods, with one
unifying core concept: the lyrics were
entirely Norwegian and therefore we
couldn’t understand a word.
This may sound hideous, but the
music was fantastic to dance to and
the bands were all of a very high
standard (it’s by no means a coinci-
dence that those horn-hatted bas-
tards won Eurovision). The house
has a long history for spotting rising
talents. The club assured us their lat-
est find, Lilly Allen, a female rapper,
will soon be a household name. Watch
this space.
Aside from the music the bar was
excellently priced including a fantas-
tic cocktail bearing the name Die of
Pleasure (£4) (Note the factual infor-
mation). The club is also unique in
running a student friendly Saturday
night, with admission at £6 (£4 on
guestlist).
If, like us, you prefer Baroque to
Blur-Rock, a requiem to Eminem,
or Rachmaninov to, oh fuck we can’t
find another pun, the club also runs
a classical themed chill out evening
once a month, presided over by a DJ
from Classic FM.
To round off, the décor was arty and
cutting edge, the drinks were both
cheap and tasty, and we are currently
contemplating holidaying in Oslo. The
club is affordable for students and its
smorgasbord of nights ensure that
there is something to suit all tastes.
Some clubs we review (like Nag) are
ridiculous to the extreme. Some, like
Mamilanji’s, are members only, but
this is the genuine article: a good club
that welcomes students. Hopefully all
the factual information you need!

Oooh. Norwegianish
A little intoxicated and more than a
little nostalgic for the days when you
could have a good Friday night out in
Shoreditch, our fine nightlife editor
Gregory and I set off on a mission to
discover exactly what had replaced
the much-loved And Did We Mention
Our Disco at Plastic People. We could
not have anticipated what horrors
awaited us.
Our Disco has been replaced by a
night called Spacebase, which appar-
ently consists of a mind-boggling mix-
ture of Jewish salsa and disco-funk,
making for an experience somewhat
akin to a rather under-attended Bar
Mitzvah.
The majority of the clientele seemed
to have either randomly strolled in,
looking for somewhere to stay the
night, or were in some way related to
the promoters of the clubnight, and
were only there to freeload a bunch of
drinks. The DJ seemed to think that
Djing meant playing a track all the
way through, leaving a 3 second gap
of silence, then starting the next one
from the compilation album CD he
found in the bargain bucket at HMV.
I would highly recommend this club
night if you want to be surrounded
by predominantly foreign people, and
listen to music that is so bad it is an
offence to your ears.
After fleeing Plastic People in a
rush, Gregory and I made our way
round the corner to 333, a popular
haunt for people with no taste in
music, but hell, with a queue that big
it had to have something going for it,
didn’t it? A friendly, somewhat scruffy
looking man on the door told us we
could expect to hear a ferocious mix
of hard electro and rock and roll! How
could we resist?
Having queued for what seemed
like aeons and parting with an outra-
geous sum of money, we were final-
ly in! The club has two rooms and
after enduring the brain-destroyingly
horrendous noise of some live band
they had playing downstairs, we set-
tled into the main room where The
Smiths entertained us briefly before
the nightmare began.
Imagine our dismay when the DJ,
proudly displaying a Metallica t-shirt
on his chest, refused to serenade us
with the dulcet tones of Pantera (I
begged!) or indeed anything that was
not straight up gangsta rap. Having
been promised a night of electro and
rock and roll, Greg and I were some-
what surprised when the entire cast
of Prison Break strolled out into the
club with microphones, for a live set.
Upon escaping downstairs it
became apparent that the entire club
night was simply an exercise in pair-
ing up inherently incompatible gen-
res of music as we found ourselves
surrounded by a sweaty horde of
cowboys and hillbillies listening to a
delightful mix of 50’s rock and roll and
bluegrass.
Although not quite the same as
actually being in hell, this club night
did come close. However, if like most
of the people in the club you are
more interested in taking drugs in
the toilets than enjoying some decent
music, I am sure the whole experi-
ence would be a delight!
