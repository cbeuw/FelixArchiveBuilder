Scorpio (Oct 23rd – Nov 21st)
Got love on the mind?
Well it’s not hard to
see why. Distractions
of every sort, though,
are disastrous this
week. Stay focused on
work for a few more
days then you can let
your hair down.
Sagittarius (Nov 22nd – Dec 21st)
Spring fever has
arrived and your
symptoms are worse
than most. Hang on
in there and all will be
fine, and you’ll have a
great new relationship
to show for it.
Capricorn (Dec 22nd – Jan 19th)
Although times past
haven’t been fruitful,
the cosmic forces
show the only way to
fulfil high demands is
to keep aiming high.
Aquarius (Jan 20th – Feb 18th)
Unfortunately this
week, several jealous
looks will knock your
confidence. Stand
up for yourself and
be prepared, for the
worst is yet to come.
Pisces (Feb 19th – Mar 20th)
Uranus will be domi-
nating your life for
the next week, and
will teach you to relax
more and become less
calculating in love
decisions. Follow your
heart.
Aries (Mar 21st - Apr 20th)
You, an emotional
cripple?! Ha ha, well
this week you will
prove others wrong
when you are the last
one standing after you
suffer some emotional
turbulence in your
closest friendships.
Taurus (Apr 21st - May 21st)
We all know that
cats have 9 lives,
but since when
are bulls importal?
Overconfidence will
be your downfall. The
clock is ticking and
your luck is begining
to run out.
Gemini (May 22nd – Jun 21st)
The time has come to
air your grievances
to those around you.
In doing so you will
go into June feeling
like the worries of the
world have been lifted
from your shoulders.
Cancer (Jun 22nd – Jul 22nd)
It doesn’t always
benefit you to depend
upon the kindness of
strangers, but then
again, since when do
you do what makes
sense?
Leo (Jul 23rd – Aug 22nd)
You will do well
to maintain your
distance from loved
ones this week. In
doing so you may find
new ways to keep a
partner keen.
Virgo (Aug 23rd – Sep 22nd)
Ok, it didn’t work out.
Too bad! Stop beating
yourself up. It could
have happened to
anyone. Everything
depends on how you
respond now. Think
before you act.
Libra (Sept 23rd - Oct 22nd)
You are conserva-
tive, don't do much
of anything, and are
considered lazy. You
should avoid standing
still for long periods
of time as you tend to
attract pigeons.
Feeling Relegation...
Dear Miss C,
I'm a guy who really appreciates
beauty. Girls are awesome, but
I'm having trouble finding one.
The thing is that I kinda have high
standards, which means that girls
I'm interested in are probably out of
my league, and the few that would
have me, well, they just don't do it
for me. Does this mean that I'm des-
tined to be lonely for all eternity?
Cell Ektiv
Dear Cell Ektiv,
Unfortunately there is just no get-
ting around the problem of who you
do and don’t fancy. Many people will
turn around and say that there is
no such thing as a ‘league’ but to
them I say denial. There are always
exceptions, although when you look
at the celebrity list the exceptions
are normally gold diggers. We all
know how a spark is needed for
a relationship to get started, but
beauty can sometimes only be skin
deep. The solution here would be
to broaden your outlook and not
always be so quick to reject. Now,
I can’t pretend to be a psychic (I’ll
leave that to Mystic Stars), but I
doubt that your penchant for beau-
tiful women is going to cause you
to end up all alone. If you’re really
that worried though, aim to get
rich quick. Then you’ll have loads
of flashy girls running around after
you, but they’ll only want you for
your money and they’ll either be
dumb as can be or scarily conniving.
Just take it slowly, I mean you’re
still in uni. Yes I have heard about
the 10% who meet their future part-
ner at uni, but do you really think
those stats apply to IC? It’s not a
normal university now, is it? Just
enjoy your youth, and when you
least expect it sparks will fly. Maybe
she’ll be gorgeous, who knows.
Relight my fire!
Dear Miss C
3 months ago a guy in my class
came up to me in the JCR during
the lunch break. As I didn't really
know him, I stopped the chat in
less than 2 min and left him sitting
on the sofa alone. After that I felt
guilty, especially when my friend
told me that this guy is extremely
shy and that it is impossible for
him to talk to a girl. Like a spy I
tried to catch the moment when he
works, he smiles, etc. Now I think
I am in love with him. How ironic!
Every time he walks past me, it’s
like there’s gold on the floor; he
never looks up. I tried to join his
friends circle, but no luck. I seri-
ously cannot think of any other
ways. Help!
ShySassySillyGirl
Dear ShySassySillyGirl,
As much as I want to berate you
for you silliness I find myself in the
awkward position of complete and
utter sympathy. We have all been
there, but first things first you need
to get over this. Ok, you made a
mistake, some random guy came
up to you and you cut him down. So
what? Who wouldn’t? Do you only
like him because you think that
he likes you? The problem there
though is how do you know whether
he still likes you? You need to break
the ice, become his friend first. Act
as thought you don’t really fancy
him. Sit next to him in the compu-
ter room, pretend you’re computer
leper and need help. Subtlety is the
key here. Try tripping him up, and
then whilst apologising, confess
all. Or next time you go out club-
bing, dance around him topless. I
mean come on, if that doesn’t get
his attention what will? If all else
fails I suggest you just go and talk
to him, something he probably won’t
expect. Don’t forget: honesty is the
best policy.
Head on?
To Miss C,
I'm not complaining, but my new
girlfriend loves giving me head.
She cannot get enough of it. Now,
I really can't claim to have much
experience in these matters, and I
don't think it's bad in any way, but
I've certainly never come across
this before. Is this normal?! Do
most girls enjoy it quite as much
as she does?! I have no problem
returning the favour but I definitely
don't take quite as much pleasure
from it as she does.
Mr. Grateful
Dear Mr. Grateful,
Now why do I have the feeling that
you’re sitting in the JCR surround-
ed by your group of bloke mates
who are praising you and worship-
ping the ground that you walk on?
Talk about gratuitous praise. If your
girlfriend enjoys giving you head so
much, why are you questioning it?
Ever heard of tempting fate a bit
too much? Don’t forget women are
pretty good at acting, and you’re
probably not great at seeing right
through her faking! Hint: this might
not be all that she’s faking, ever
seen When Harry met Sally? If I
were you I’d stop analysing the situ-
ation and enjoy it while you can.
Like you said, you’ve never come
across this before and you’ll prob-
ably never come across it again!
Dear Miss Confidentiality...
Hey guys, I’m about, and as help-
ful as ever. Star letter gets a pair
