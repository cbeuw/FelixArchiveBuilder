2 FELIX
COMMENT
My term of o f f i c e as E d i t o r of F e l i x
"began prematurely on F r i d a y , 27th May
w i t h the r e s i g n a t i o n of I a n Williams. The
day before, a t the IC Union Meeting, he was
attached i n a l e t t e r read by Mr. F a i n f o r
having p r i n t e d an a r t i c l e concerning RCS
Union finances which was a l l e g e d t o be mis-
chievous and f a c t u a l l y i n c o r r e e t ,
A . F l e t c h e r , IC President, should n o t
have allowed the reading of t h i s l e t t e r .
I t contained a vague d e s c r i p t i o n of RCSU's
f i n a n c i a l p o s i t i o n - ,â‚¬750 l e f t , but a l s o
attached I a n Williams p e r s o n a l l y as being
responsible f o r a 'a mischievous and f a c -
t u a l l y wrong a r t i c l e ' and questioned h i s
i n t e g r i t y and a b i l i t y . This came a t a
time which was c a l c u l a t e d t o i n f l u e n c e
v o t i n g i n the f o l l o w i n g e l e c t i o n f o r De-
puty P r e s i d e n t , i n which I a n was standing,
but a t no time was he permitted t o defend
himself.
The main purpose of t h i s issue i s t o
b r i n g t o our readers' a t t e n t i o n the pre-
sent s t a t e of RCSU's f i n a n c e s and c o r r e c t
those who might have been m i s l e d by the
o r i g i n a l a r t i c l e . Nobody has quibbled
w i t h the f i g u r e s given i n that a r t i c l e ,
only the conclusions reached. The new
f i g u r e s were e v e n t u a l l y provided by Pre-
sident S c o t t . However, they were p r o v i -
ded l a t e because despite repeated promises
to allow F e l i x t o see t h e accounts he has
been most e l u s i v e , r e l e n t i n g only a t the
eleventh hour.
Various points emerge from t h i s f r a c a s .
C l e a r l y RCSU executive have been over-
spending over the l a s t year w i t h very
l i t t l e c o n t r o l . This the o r d i n a r y members
of the Union d i d not know and, but f o r the
F e l i x r e p o r t and the subsequent Extraord-
i n a r y Union Meeting would nevex have
known. Therefore F e l i x has brought out
i n t o the open some dubious spending which
would otherwise undoubtedly ha-ve been
covered up by the executive concerned. I t
was unfortunate that the a r t i c l e jumped
to some wrong conclusions. I f there had
bden co-operation between F e l i r x and Mr.
Scott the whole ugly badness need never
have occurred. I t i s e s s e n t i a l that good
r e l a t i o n s shojild be kept between F e l i x and
Unions executive i n order that harmful
misunderstandings should not take place.
*RC3 Union have i n f a c t passed a motion
requesting more co-operation next y e a r , so
they haveclearnt and so have F e l i x .
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
S i r ,
I should just l i k e t o point out
through your columns* that my sudden d e c i -
s i o n to hand over t h e E d i t o r s h i p of t h i s
newspaper a t midnight on Thursday, 26th
May was based not on any sense of g u i l t ,
but on the proximity of emminatj ons. I
regret having burdened yop w i t h t h i s res-
p o n s i b i l i t y a t such a time*
I deeply regret that Mr. P a i n was
misquoted i n e r r o r . A t the time of w r i t -
i n g t h i s l e t t e r (Saturday) no f a c t s have
been brought to l i g h t t o disprove the
f i n a n c i a l b a s i s i n the s t o r y I published
the l a s t issue concerning the f i n a n c e s of
RCS Union. I was as shocked as anyone
e l s e a t the l e t t e r presented t o Thursday's
IC Union Annual General Meeting by Mr. S.
J . Pain, the RCSU Treasurer - the more so
s i n c e I had been p r e v i o u s l y assured by
the Chairman of the Meeting that i t was t o
b r i n g t o l i g h t f a c t s about RCSU f i n a n o e s
which would show the FELIX story t o be a t
variances. This i t d i d not, b e i n g merely
a p e r s o n a l attack, c a l c u l a t e d t o be p a r t -
i c u l a r l y i n j u r i o u s a t t h a t time.
Mr. P a i n was wrong i n h i s c l a i m that
he had no opportunity f o r r e p l y i n the
columns df FELIX before October. On a
matter of such import the FELIX S t a f f can
be r e l i e d upon t o produce, not by any
means f o r the f i r s t time, a s p e c i a l issue*
A t any other time i n the year I should
p e r s o n a l l y have seen that the whole argu-
ment was c l e a r e d upj now, f o r me a t l e a ^
academic work must take absolute preference
In view of the contents of the l e t t e r
and of h i s e a r l i e r d i s c u s s i o n w i t h FELIX
S t a f f the President of the Union srhould
have again consulted the FELIX S t a f f be-
f o r e the Meeting over the r i g h t t o r e p l y .
The FELIX correspondence columns always
allow t h i s r i g h t t o r e p l y ; Mr. F l e t c h e r
did not permit such a t the Union Meeting.
D.I. WILLIAMS
