R C S U to break even?
R C S T J w i l l d e f i n i t e l y not
be broke a t the end of t h i s
year. A f t e r s t a r t i n g the year
with £182 from the previous
.year and .£1,000 of stocks i t
tppears that they may have t o
draw on some of the money held
is stocks.
DEFICIT OF £k1
Income so f a r t h i s year
lias been £2244 and expenditure
CI474; further b i l l s which
iave j u s t been recieved or
are expected ammount to
uround £775- As there w i l l
be more r e c e i p t s and b i l l s to
;ome i n , because t h i s i s not
,he end of the year, t h i s
apparent d e f i c i t of £4 may
turn, out to be wrong by up t o
-100.in e i t h e r d i r e c t i o n . I t
is a feature of a l l Union
secounts that the f i n a l exp-
nditure f o r the year cannot
be accurate I y known u n t i l w e l l
into the sunnier vacation,
however, Imperial College
Union Council does have a
statement from i t s Senior
treasurer on the estimated
i n a n c i a l s i t u a t i o n before
very meeting.
WHERE THE MONEY WENT
The grant which UCSU r e c -
ived from ICU at the beginning
>f the year between the comp-
t i n g i n t e r e s t s and was then
aviewed h a l f way through the
ear. This gave a grant of
ipproximately £700 to the
Jlubs Committee, £130 to the
i'nts. Committee and £250 t o
;over losses on dinners. This
e f t about £100 f o r general
xpenses. I t now seems that
h e E n t s b i l l w i l l be s i i g h t l y
reater and the actual losses
n the dinners w i l l be £266.

apology
A GRAVE mistake was made
in the l a s t issue of FELIX i n
a t t r i b u t i n g the quotation,
"A waste of public fluids", to
Mr H.J. 1'ain, Senior Treasur
-er of IiCSU. Mr Pain never
made t h i s remark and FELIX
would l i k e to apologise f o r
any embarrassment t h i s e r r o r
might, have caused him.
LAST Thursday, RCS Union
attempted at an extraordinary
general meeting t o s e t i t s
own mind at r e s t about i t s
finances. A r e s o l u t i o n was
passed asking i t s representat-
ives on ICU Council to demand
a r e e l e c t i o n f o r the post of
Deputy President in view of
the way i n which an attack on
Ian Williams had been permit-
ted immediately before the
e l e c t i o n without g i v i n g him
a chance toproduce a defence .
CONFLICTING STATEMENTS
The meeting got under way
with a motion from Mr Duckett
asking that a f u l l statement
of finances should be given to
the RCSU. He s a i d that at the
moment there were two c onf l i c t -
ing statements running round
the College. There was the
FELIX statement that RCSU was
broke and the l e t t e r of Mr Pain
which stated that RCSUhad £750.
FELIX had got i t s story from
the RCSU Committee meeting and
D u k e elected
CIVIL Engineer Postgrad-
uate Tony Duke, was elected
President and M e t a l l u r g i s t
Brendon Parker was appointed
Honorary Secretary of I.C.
Union at the IC J o i n t Council
Meeting on Monday. Mr, Duke
who defeated Chairman of SCC
Keith Guy commented that he
was very pleased t o be elect-
ed and that he regarded him-
s e l f as a representative of
the student body.
that as f a r as he could t e l l
i t was mainly accurate. In do-
ing h i s research he had found
that the minutes of the partic-
u l a r Committee meeting were a
disgrace as they b r i e f e d over
the whole business and t o l d
nothing of what had been s a i d .
FINANCIAL EXPLANATION
Mr Pain then gave the meet-
ing a very c l e a r statement on
the p o s i t i o n of finances. He
s a i d that more b i l l s were
s t i l l t o come i n but i t looked
as though there would be about
£750 l e f t as stocks at the
end of the year. ( F u l l e r det-
a i l s of the finances are given
elsewhere). Before doing t h i s
he went to great lengths t o
explain that he had no power
to decide not wish t o i n f l u -
ence the way i n which the
Union spends i t s money. " A l l
I do i s keep the books and
issue warnings i n committee.
