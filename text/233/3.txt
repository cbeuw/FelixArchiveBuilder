3 FELIX
RCSU TO BREAK EVEN (oont. from 1.1)
In the l a s t two years expenditure has
been running a t a higher l e v e l than pre-
v i o u s l y , apparently because Executive
P o l i c i e s have meant a l o o s e r c o n t r o l of
f i n a n c e . As Dave Christopher ( l a s t year's
A s s i s t a n t Secretary) s a i d a t the RCSU
Meeting "We don't want t o account f o r the
l a s t penny", - t a l k i n g about t h e pedal-
car -race - and l a t e r "we went out of our
way to spend our money".
In t a l k i n g about RCSU f i n a n c e s the
Senior Treasurer, Mr. P a i n , s a i d that he
did not t h i n k the Union should have r e -
serves, but he warned the meeting that i f
they went on overspending i n t h i s wag?
they -would be broke i n two or three years.
In answer t o a question Mrs P a i n s a i d that
tv/o years ago cash reserves stood a t £482
(of which ,£300 was scent l a s t year) and tha
i f stocks have t o be s o l d t h i s year i t w i l l
be the f i r s t time w h i l s t he has been
Treasurer.

FREE HOLIDAY ICS 1-EDAL-CAR SUFPORlERo
The r e p o r t on the Pedal Car Race f i n -
ances Yvhich was asked f o r a t the RCSUEGLI
l a s t week has now been posted on the no-
t i c e boards. This shows that there was a
t o t a l expenditure on items connected w i t h
the pedal c a r t h i s year of £91, not £110
as quoted at the meeting. This i s because
one o r two items which were o r i g i n a l l y
thought t o have been spent on the pedal
car were i n f a c t spent on J e z .
This £91 may be s p l i t up i n t o three
parts. £9 went onto t h i s yeo.rs account,
but was t o pay f o r insurance on a minibus
which was h i r e d , but not used, l a s t year.
About £50 was spent on the team expenses
and the r e c o n s t r u c t i o n of the car t o gain
maximum b e n e f i t s from the new handicap
r u l e s . A f u r t h e r £32 10s. was spent on
p r o v i d i n g supporters w i t h a f r e e t r i p t o
B r i s t o l . This expenditure was approved
by President S c o t t i n the bar one n i g h t .
