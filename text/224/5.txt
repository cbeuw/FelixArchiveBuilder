Grants and the
Union Meeting
J\T T H E LAST Union meeting
Keith Cavanagh ruined his
motion about loans to students
by adding a demand for the abol-
ition of the means test.
What justification is there for say-
ing that all students need equal
grants? I cannot believe that even
Keith Cavanagh would seriously sug-
gest that a student whose circum-
stances are now such that he receives
the minimum award of £50 should
automatically receive the full grant.
The result of such action could
only be one of two things. Either
taxation would be increased, or the
value of the grant would be cut so
that the total expenditure on grants
remained constant. Both eventuali-
ties would lead to hardship— particu-
larly i n the lower income groups.
The abolition of the means test
would be in complete contradiction to
the original ideas of the Beveridge Re-
port, upon which our social services
are based, that aid should be given to
those members of the community who
are in need.
A person's ability to pay taxes is
determined by a " means test." It is
thus only fair that his right to receive
aid should be determined in a similar
way. Surely a grant should be re-
garded as a privilege and not as a
right?
Keith Cavanagh demands the abo-
lition of the means test so that a
student no longer shall depend on his
parents. Does he see nothing wrong
in depending on the parents of other
students, the taxpayers?

\I/ITH REGARD to the last Union
" meeting I was appalled by the
unusual number of points of informa-
tion offered by certain members of
the Union to nearly every speaker
from the floor. This showed a lack
of knowledge about the working of
the grant system in particular and
the general educational system in this
country in general on the part of the
speakers some of whose speeches
were absurd and irrelevant and
seemed to be designed merely to pro-
ject images for electoral purposes.
This is of couse deplorable and much
valuable time was wasted on amend-
ments and points of information
when real business should have been
got through. It is important that all
speakers from the floor should fully
inform themselves on the issues to be
raised before coming to the Union
meeting and should confine them-
selves to the points relevant to the
issue and should be ai brief as pos-
sible. Rhetoric is deplorable. I
should hate an l.C. union meeting de-
generating into a typical NUS confer-
ence involved in matter of proce-
dures, amendments and the like.

I.C. Missed Out Again
|>/V DECEMBER 1963, I.C. were invited to send two representatives
to a" European Week " organised by The Ecole Centrale of Paris.
Birmingham University and Cambridge were also asked ot send two
delegates each. Jenny Chapman and I represented I.C The meeting
was in fact a seminar on advanced
technical education in Europe.
The countries represented were
the Common Market countries
plus England and Switzerland.
Fares to and from Paris were met
by the Union, and food and ac-
commodation were provided by
the host University.
Realising that we were extremely
fortunate to be getting the benefit of
this experience, Miss Chapman and I
did all that we could to pass the
benefit on to other members of the
College. To this end we prepared a
lengthy report for the Rector, copies
of which were given to Dave Watson,
the then President of the Union, and
kept in the Union files. In this report
we stressed that both Birmingham
and Cambridge were intending to or-
ganise return meetings, and that I.C.
being the foremost technical Univer-
sity in the country, should take the
initiative and organise a seminar the
following year.
Reports containing recommenda-
tions to this effect were published in
FELIX and the 'Guild's Year Book,
" Spanner." I would like to quote
from it:
" Birmingham and Cambridge are
planning a return meeting in England,
so we should move quickly, or one of
the smaller colleges will steal the Init-
iative from us."
This is exactly what has happened.
As was reported in the last issue of
FELIX, Manchester University is
being host to the meeting, has ob-
tained a Government grant towards
the cost, and has invited two delegates
from l.C.
Jenny Chapman and I left the Col-
lege at the end of 1964, and were
therefore unable to organise such a
meeting ourselves. The report rotted
in the Rector's Office and in the
Union records, and l.C. missed out
again.
If l.C. continues in this ostrich-like
manner, we shall soon be the second
or third Technical University in the
country.

ED.—Due to this issue's over-
whelming postbag, I regret that it was
necessary to cut this letter. The full

House in Order
\Y7777/ reference to Mr. Cawson's
article on foreigners in l.C., may 1
say that l.CS.F.R.E. does not inten-
tionally concern itself, in the main,
with external affairs, and would very
mudh like to set " our own house in
order."
If any of your readers have racial
difficulties where they feel we may
be able to help, or have constructive
ideas as to how we can make l.C. a
more amenable and integrated society,
or in fact anything positive we can
do to aid overseas students, we would
be very pleased to hear from them.

Secretary of ICS.F.R.E.
Jeans
are better,
Mr. Doe!
W / / T H reference to Mr. Doe's article
in the late news of the last issue,
while agreeing with him about dirty
shoes and jackets, I must point out
that there are several advantages in
the wearing of jeans.
(a) If a motor cycle is the main
form of transport, one doesn't need
to worry about ruining a good pair
of trousers.
(b) Since jeans can be washed at
regular intervals with very little effort,
one doesn't have to worry about get-
ting i,z o a dirty situation (e.g. on the
floor).
(c) Damage. While scrambling be-
tween the chairs in a crowded Upper
Refec. last week my jeans got badly
ripped—was I glad I wasn't wearing
an expensive pair of trousers ?
In conclusion, I and many others
find jeans far more comfortable than
a conventional pair of trousers, and
dread the day when, to conform to
the " done thing," we shall be forced
to wear " neatly pressed trousers."
The answer is, if you don't like them,
don't wear them, but please leave
those of us who do alone.

Too Much Tedium ?
J HAVE yet to read a copy of
your paper without coming
across the name of Needham. In
each issue we are confronted with
a trivial, how else can they be de-
scribed, quote or escapade of this
rather insignificant character.
It is a great pity that you seem
unable to devote your space to items
of interest or news value, rather than
indulge this pompous fellow's desire
of attracing attention. Your com-
ments have ranged from " that well-
known personality . . ." (this I've
found to be entirely untrue), cul-
minating in last week's report of
Needhan\ crowned as Miss World,
which as we all know speaks for
itself.
1 do not begrudge a person pub-
licity provided it is deserved, so
please no more of Needham.
If things are allowed to carry on
the way they are we must expect what
soon will be the inevitable, a roughly
scrawled message on the Union's .
lavatory wall " Needham was here."

| MUST protest against the sur-
prisingly immature attack on
Mike Scott and Ken West in your
last issue. I use tlie word sur-
prisingly as the writer, Ignotus,
appeared to be totally against
what \he called sixth form atti-
Were We Unanimous?
TN YOUR last edition you carry an
^•article concerning the introduction
of compulsory dinners in Keogh
Hall. It states: " It seems that
' Keoghlogians' are particularly keen
to meet their companions in Hall.
. . ." What is not mentioned is the
fact that this scheme has only be-
come necessary because the weekly
dinners already held on a voluntary
basis are sa poorly attended. That
the proposal was accepted " en
masse " by the Hall, as stated by Mr.
Wallum, I would question ; and
whether it would be a good thing if
it were, I question even more
strongly.
Should people be encouraged to
rely on discipline imposed from
" above"! A K E O G H L O G I A N .
tudes.
It is particularly disturbing as Mr.
Needham's letter attacking a similarly
destructive report in your last issue
was almost adjacent to the article.
Must we assume that these rather
childish statements about RCS. (and
only R.C.S.) officials are part of your
Editorial policy ?
These two men were, at the time
Ignotus refers to, making a perfectly
justifiable attack on the most twisted
and inaccurate report I have ever seen
in any student publication (I have
seen similar in the EXPRESS and
PRAVDA). I refer to the report of
tlie RCS. Union meeting (R.C.S.
again whilst Guilds got a most flatter-
ing report).
I therefore ask that you, as Editor,
must accept responsibility for this
article. An apology is called for from
you to Mr. West and Mr. Scott and
also to all your readers for insulting
their intelligence so. Also I hope that
such articles are discontinued.

P.S.—Sir, I trust if this letter is
published not too many cuts are
made. I understand Mr. Needham's
letter was weakened by cutting parts
of it.
E D . — N o cuts were made in M r .
Needham's letter. If cuts are made
in any letter published in F E L I X a
note is added to that effect.
Quote Fictcncr re Ignotus : " The
thing is, :
t was of quite a high literary
standard."

HERE ARE twenty-three clubs
A
comprising I.C.A.C.C., the largest
of these being Imperial College Rug-
by Football Club. The abbreviation
for this is not as you have printed
in each edition of Felix so far, but
simply 1CR.F.C.
It would appear from your columns
that the members of the Rugby Club
go round en masse creating havoc.
This I feel is unjust. The people who
set out to spoil events, are bound to
belong to RCS., C. & G. or RS.M.
just as they belong to the Rugby-
Club. Who knows some of them may
even have names. It is evident that
of late, Felix has been scraping the
barrel for want of things to say, but
don't victimise 120 members of a club
for the sake of printing 4 or 5 names.
On the subject of names, I feel that
the case for decreasing the number
of anonymous writers by one, far out-
weighs that for increases in their
number. Either that or call this other
nonentity Ignoramus.
Pretty soon Felix will be run by a
phantom board with nothing better to
do than the victimisation of non-
existan, Clubs.KERRY
Chairman ACC.
Ignotus replies : 1 quite agree with
Mr. Peters that the number of anony-
mous writers on Felix should be de-
creased by one. The problem is, how
to get rid of Colcutt ? Also, without
the protection of anonymity, what
columnist would run the risk of being
poked by a Rugby Club hefty ?
