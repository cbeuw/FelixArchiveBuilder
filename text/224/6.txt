Cheap seats
at the Theatre
J F Y O U A R E at a bit of a loose
end one evening, and want in-
expensive professional entertain-
ment, why not try the nearest
theatre to College ?
The Royal Court, home, of the
English Stage Company, at'- Sloane
Square (one stop on the Circle/District
Line, and next to the station) offers
students any seat available in the
house within a quarter-hour of the
performance for 5/- on production of
a Union card.
Highlights for the coming months
include " Serjeant Musgrave's Dance "
which established itself in 1959 as
a modern classic and its author, John
Arden, as a major dramatist, and " A
Chaste Maid in Cheapside," a Jaco-
bean comedy about problems of sex
and marriage, together with two suc-
cesses from their Autumn season,
" Saved" and " The Cresta Run."
Owing to censorship, however,
" Saved " is only open to members of
the English Stage Society. Even here
the Royal Court has borne students
in mind by offering a special rate
of 5/- a year instead of one guinea.
Regrettably, the play I saw at the
Royal Court has just ended its present
run. , " Shelley"—by A n n Jellicoe
who also wrote " The K n a c k " —
traces the life of the poet from his
expulsion from Oxford at the age of
twenty to his mysterious and untimely
death eight years later.

Drugs and Brink
A Christmas Puzzle
by the Braintanglers
J N SELDOMSLEWED A V E N U E there is
a row of four houses in which four
couples live. These couples have been the
subject of a police enquiry in which some
strange facts have come to light. Each of
the couples has a drug addition and is par-
tial to a particular drink. This road is un-
usual in the neighbourhood because of the
sports cars which are always parked outside
their owners' houses. Before the police can
swoop on the spy ring, which they know is
operating in the area, they must sort out the
habits of the occupants. The evidence which
they have gathered through their agents is set
out below, can you help them to solve the
problem ? A token prize of half a guinea
will be offered for the first correct solution
to arrive in the Felix pigeon hole in the
Union Rack before Wednesday, 19th Jan.
Solutions must contain a brief description
of the method used.
1. Mr. Neversober does not drive an Italian
car, nor does he drink whiskey.
Mrs. Ofendrunk shops for herself and her
neighbour and buys whiskey and gin.
Vodka goes well with cocaine.
Mr. Allcanned objects to his neighbour's
Ferrari blocking the end of the road.
The Maserati driver likes heroin but is
sick if he takes gin or vodka.
A D.B.6 uses more petrol than a Midget
which allows its owner to smoke opium.
Mrs. Undertable is fussy about cars and
would not let her husband buy a Maserati
or a Midget.
8. Purple Hearts need to be taken in large
quantities but Mr. Neversober's neigh-
bour has a large mouth.

Your Summer Holiday?
" p O R E I G H T years Jean tic Marigny
•*• and his Australian wife have specia-
lised in travel and holidays for stu-
dents and young people. Though
their firm, Europe Student Travel
(formerly Angle-German Youth Ser-
vice) never advertised until a few
months ago, except in their own
brochures, their customers today
total over 20,000 a year.
M r . ue Marigny naturally has a
clear idea of students' needs. " First
they need transport at rock-bottom
cost," he says, " Even .' you hitch
you'll be lucky to get to Bonn from
London for less than our £4 3s. 6d.
charge for comfortable rail-and-boat
travel.
"As for holiday accommodation, we
provide camps and " youth hotels"
that are simple but still well above
youth hostel standard. Thanks to
generous West German government
help a fortnight's stay in a very com-
fortable camp costs only £8 12s.
" In these centres students of many
nationalities can meet and enjoy
normal holiday activities while still
having plenty of time to talk and talk
and talk."
Though he has lived in Britain since
1949 M r . de Marigny is still a French
citizen—and still very French. One
reason for his success is his skill in
cutting overheads. He and his wife
have only five assistants. Outside the
high season you are more likely than
not to find M r . de Marigny himself
serving personal callers at Europe
Student Travel's headquarters just off
Kensington Church Street.
