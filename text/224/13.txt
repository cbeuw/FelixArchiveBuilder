' REGISTRATION FORMS STOLEN.
It has been confirmed (see front page) that a large nimber of v e h i c l e
r e g i s t r a t i o n forms returned., to the Keogh/Selkirk entrance were i n f a c t
s t o l e n between Sunday and Wednesday. T h i s p o i n t l e s s and unsucessful sabo-
tage w i l l be countered by the Car Parking Committee by i s s u i n g each res-
ident of Southside from 'whom they have not recleved a r e p l y w i th a f r e s h
r e g i s t r a t i o n form.
It i s hoped to have the r e g i s t r a t i o n s completed by Christmas, i n
order that c l e a r i n g of the park may commence i n the New Year.

of S i r John Hawkshaw, p i l o t tunnels, 1-gmlles long were dug from both
sides of the channel. There was so much o p p o s i t i o n , mainly from m i l i t a r y ,
that the scheme was eventually dropped.
I t was not u n t i l 1958 that the subject was again r a i s e d , when a
Channel Tunnel study group was set up, w i t h a Government grant of three
