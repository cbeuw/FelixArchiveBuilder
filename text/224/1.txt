MEALS TO
COST MORE
NEXT YEAR
p RICE INCREASES in all the refectories are likely after a meet-
ing of the Refectories' Committee to-day. There are no proposals
for refurnishing any of the refectories as yet, but the Ground Level
restaurant in Southside is presently unier investigation by a working
party. These points emerged
Southside cars
to be towed away ?
§ OUTHSIDE WAS SHOCKED last week when it discovered that
yet another committee had been formed within its walls. A newly
former! Southside Car Parking Committee, apparently with power to
tow vehicles away from the Southside car park had emerged, yet few
people had heard of its existence or how the election of the rulers of
this powerful group had been carried out.
Pete Hills, a civil engineering lecturer, Falmouth sub-warden and I.C.
Car Parking Committee member admitted to " F E L I X " that he had been the
force behind the formation of the com- f
mittee. H e considers that Southside
residents have a tremendous Drivileee

It seems that rising costs and falling
takings have lead to Mr. Mooney's
coming to the conclusion that the only
solution is an increase in tariffs which
may be noticed next term. " F E L I X "
trusts that the Refectories Committee
meeting to consider prices will con-
cern itself with reviewing the whole
catering field in the College, to con-
sider if any other way of absorbing
the cost is practical (e.g. increasing the
rate of turnover in the self service
refectories would help encourage stu-
dents to eat there, spreading the costs
over more meals).
A n Indian Curry corner, a self-
service cafeteria and a roped off sec-
tion for the present waitress service
are among considerations for a new-
look ground floor refectory in South
Side—to relieve pressure on the other
overworked facilities. High priority
will be given to continuing the self-
service restaurant with its better meals
at slightly higher prices.
It seems that all the College's eating
problems should be solved in five
years time when the new refectories
open in the central college block, j q
Felix Colour?
A COLOUR supplement for
FELIX in Michaelmas 1966 ?
A working party was set up to look
into the possibility of producing a
joint colour supplement to student
newspapers mainly in the South East
after a conference of Editors here at
Imperial Colltge.
The Editors came to the conference,
which was attended by observers from
the outside Press, at the invitation of
F E L I X , , and have appointed repre-
sentatives of 1 N C A N T (Canterbury),
B E A V E R (LSE), B E A C O N (North-
ampton), S L A T E (Institute of Educa-
tion) and F E L I X to the working
party, I N C A N T agreeing to handle
the initial correspondence involved.
The seventeen representatives pre-
sent at the conference considered that
a circulation of 50,000 (giving a read-
ership of upwards of 200,000) was
desirable to attract the money-earning
advertising, any more being too un-
wieldy in management.
The object of the supplement would
be to help the Newspapers earn
revenue to boost their (usually)
minimal Union grants
A divergence of opinion over the advisability of scaffolding in front
of Southside led to this pile-up early Friday morning.
EVANS LIES TO UNION
" J N POLITICS it is necessary
to lie on occasions " was the
reply which L.S.E. President,
Alan Evans, made when accused
at an L.S.E. Union Council Meet-
ing at the end of November of
misleading the Unio.:.
Alan Evans told a Union General
Meeting that the motion to join the
American-run International Students
Conference had been put forward
by the Council. Council had not been
consulted at all.
Evans, who is a strong supporter
of U.S. policy—notably i n Vietnr.m—
has said that the people who are criti-
cising this action are engaging in a
personal attack.
LC. President, Adrian Fletcher,
comments: " Perhaps; but I'm no
politician."
BETTER BEER
FOR
HARLINGTON
T? L E T C H E R informs F E L I X that
A
cooled storage facilities are to be
provided at Harlington, in the accom-
modation presently occupied by the
gentlemen's toilets. Fullers claim
that this will improve the beer sold at
Harlington. If it reaches the standard
of the beer they serve to visiters to
their brewery, I.C. Students will be
well pleased.
in being allowed to park in S.W.7 at
no charge. This privilege was, in his
view, being over exploited. He de-
cided to " resuscitate a dormant com-
mittee."
This was done by requesting two
members of previous parking com-
mittees to represent their halls, and
asking sub-wardens to nominate a
man from their own hall in the two
other halls. The committee, once
formed, asked M r . Stevenson to back
them with official support, and to
authorise them to remove vehicles
from the Southside Car Park at their
discretion.
The first action of the committee
was to demand of each resident that
they should register their vehicle, and
obtain I.C. stickers for them. If this
was not done the committee might
mistakenly remove their vehicle think-
ing it to be the property of a non-
resident. If any resident considered
one of his colleagues to be making ex-
cessive noise with his vehicle, he
could complain to the committee. The
matter would then be referred to the
Halls of Residence Committees.
Residents using a car for a short
period only, may register a car tem-
porarily and thus prevent an embar-
rassing situation arising. Cars will
only be removed after extensive en-
quiries as to the owner of the vehicle
have been made.
Results have already been achieved;
one old wreck has been removed and
another bought by a resident for
renovation.
After talking to Mr. Hills and two
hall reps, on this committee, it seemed
obvious that their motives were hon-
est. However, no Hall Committees
had been consulted and nor had the
residents of Southsidc. Co-operation
is difficult to get from students at all
times; but by acting in an unconven-
tional and unconstitutional way, this
Committee hao set many students
against it.
Mr. Hills apologised openly for the
way affairs had been conducted. " 1
thought I was merely reviving an old
committee, I never imagined such
trouble would follow." A lesson in
Public Relations can be learnt by all
officialdom.
The Southside Car Parking Com-
mittee has an onerous and unreward-
ing job. With co-operation from
students, it will be able to regulate
parking in the Southside Park with
great success. I wish them well and
would like to thank Mr. Hills and the
Committee for what they are trying to
do.
N.Ed.—It is reported that completed re-
gistration forms are missing from
Sout -.side.
