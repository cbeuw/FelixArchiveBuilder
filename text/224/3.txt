F E L I X 3
EUROPEANS VISIT R.S.M.
T W E L V E STUDENTS from the Universities and Schools of
Clausthal (Germany), Delft (Holland), Ecole de Mines, Paris, St.
Etienne (France), Leoben (Austria) and Ljubjana (Yugoslavia) are
currently the guests of the Royal School of Mines Union.
A wide and varied programme has
been drawn up with the aim of mak-
ing this the most impressive visit yet.
The purpose of the visit is to
broaden the knowledge of our student
guest, and promote the name and
image of the Royal School of Mines
and Imperial College as a whole, two
names already very well known on the
continent.
Tours of the Royal Mint, a dia-
mond drill manufacturer, V o n
Mappes, the historic landmarks of
London, museums and art galleries
have been arranged. Quaint English
customs and sports will be explained
i.e. bok bok, corners, tables, beat
races, etc. and demonstrated. One
evening has been set aside to follow
up the theme " a night in the life of
an English barmaid" with specific
reference to the Old Kent Road.
The climax of the visit is the Mines
Ball, a major occasion of the I C
calendar. It is quite a sight to see
these students in their college dress
uniforms and they should impress the
ladies of I.C.W.A. who it is hoped
they will be escorting.
This will be the third successive
visitation, and if previous years are
any guide, it will be a success; a tradi-
tion has grown. The size and scope
of the visits is increasing, this will be
the first time students have come from
the Communist bloc. Mines are
proud that as part of IC, they have
led in the field of Anglo-European
student relationships.

HOT TOO EXACT!
\4 E T E O R O L O G Y is a science—
* *but it is not always " t o o exact."
So asserted M r . Hayes from the Met.
Office in his talk to the Rover Crew
last Thursday. He presented a sum-
mary of the methods in use for short
range forecasting and went on to des-
cribe the way in which long range
forecasting is tackled. Since monthly
forecasts have been issued to the pub-
lic, the results have been slightly
better than would have been predicted
by chance alone. H e expressed his
belief that accuracy would improve
as experience was gained.

Immigration
Consortium
CONSORTIUM of the poli-
tical and national societies in
I.C. held a forum on immigration
on the 30fh Nov., with speakers
from Labour, Liberal and Con-
servative parties, the Campaign
Against Racial Discrimination
(CARD), and the Indian
Workers' Association.
Ivor Richard MP explained that the
immigration policy of the Govern-
ment was1
based on the " Hatterley
equation—integration without limita-
tion is impossible, limitation without
integration is indefensible."
The Conservative spokesman, M r .
Maurice Chandler, raised the idea of
temporary immigrant visas i n addi-
tion to the 8,600 immigrants men-
tioned in the White Paper.
Both M r . Richard Moore (Liberal),
and M r . Anthony Lester ( C A R D )
accepted control of immigration, but
attacked the White Paper as a sur-
render to racialist public opinion. M r .
Lester raised the issue of ghettoes
arising in our cities similar to Harlem.
Mr. Sharma (Indian Workers), a
shop steward, explained how the
Indian community had integrated it-
self into local life. He seemed not to
fear ghettoes and was intent on retain-
ing Indian culture i n Britain.

Q U O T E by the Senior Warden to
F E L I X reporter in October : " I think
it is disgusting that so many students
have cars when I can scarcely afford
a push-bike."
Mr. Stevenson has recently pur-
chased a new Jaguar.
