"THE FOCUS OF CULTURE AND
POWER—A CROSS BETWEEN M.I.T.
AND HARVARD OR . . . BETWEEN
OXFORD AND IMPERIAL COLLGE."
Past civilisations have waxed and
waned and all been rather similar.
This time things are different. We
are characterised by an exponential
rate of change. In a brief two hun-
dred years the human race will have
exhausted the world's coal and oil.
Mercury and sulphur are species even
more rapidly becoming extinct. W e
are running out of wood. In less
than forty years the mass of this
nation's industrial working population
will be essentially inessential. Soon
only the top percentile of brainpower
will be employable. The rest will
have to distract each other as best
they can. Democncv is dead.
A n d who will fjsd the hungry bil-
lions, clothe the nakeJ, contain the
fertile, bale out the boat ? The new
decision-makers, the scientists and en-
gineers of the top peonle.
The scene : Imperial College Union, focus
of culture and power, in the broad shadow
of mad, steaming, tattooed Albert. This is
the nerve centre. Here you may hear the
President himself, personally pleading with the
apathetic over the public address, the street cries
of the fund raisers, the Saturday night twitter of the
mini-teens, the unabridged voices of this nation's
whitest hopes. Make no mistake, in England higher
education is for the few. It is the elite you see
here, who pack the bars ; the tele-lounge for
children's hour. Here is part of the great educa-
tional machine which is the conscious means of
society's self-transformation. A t a moment in
history when man has begun to dominate the
entire world geography—not so long ago he was
a rare mammel—and at a moment when his mis-
takes are becoming evermore momentous—en-
lightened education is axiomatic. Here is en-
lightenment, a breeding ground for a new race
of pragmatists, innovators and long-range thinkers.
Or just a breeding ground.
Come to Imperial College, focus of culture and
power ,and see the Western World's industrial
leaders of 2000 A . D . Here you may find great
research brains tutoring the eager white hopes,
coaxing the brilliant catalysing the creative. Here
you may find a sense of adventure as industrial
man, not one hundred years old, braces himself
for the challenge of the next million years of
human life on this planet. Here you may find, on
a beer-stained chair, last week's New Musical Ex-
press.

MC out of
Crockfords Cup
jpOR the second year running,
IC entered a team of lour tor
the Crockford's Cup, but once
again, we failed to qualify (the
first 8 out of a total entry of 36
teams go through to the final).
Since the majority of the players
in these national tournaments are
hardened, experienced club players,
semi-professionals and even in some
cases, internationals, the play is gene-
rally of a high standard throughout.
The bidding of the opening hand
proved a pitfall to both I.C. pairs,
but rather fortunately, we managed to
gain 5 i.ni.p.s. on the deal.
Dealer N . N-S vulnerable.

At one table, with the IC pair sit-
ting N-S, playing strong no-trump
openers, the bidding went:—
N " E S W
I N T N o 2 C N o
2 N T N o 3N T N o
N o N o
After a N T opening, South's 2 club
bid is the Stayman convention, re-
questing partner to bid a 4 card
major suit, South's hope here being to
finish in a 4 H contract. The response
of 2 N T denies holding either four
hearts or four spades, whilst showing
a maximum no-trump opening. It is
generally sound policy with a hand
like South's to bid merely 3NT, rather
than introduce a 3D call, for 3NT is
probably going to be easier to make
than 5D, where one can afford to lose
only 2 tricks. It has the additional
advantage of giving no indication to
the opposition of what might be a
good lead. However, in this case, 5 D
is clearly a better contract. East took
some time deliberating over his initial
lead, before eventually settling on the
ten of clubs.
On the lead, declarer has no diffi-
culty in making eleven tricks, 3 in
clubs, 3 in hearts, and 5 i n diamonds.,
and in practice, 12 tricks were made
when E, having to find 5 discards on
the red suits, elected to part with
three spades and two clubs, so ena-
bling the three of clubs to take the
12th trick. Score : plus 690 N-S.
A spade lead would have set the con-
tract by one trick, provided the suit
did not get blocked.
At the other table, where weak no-
trumps were being played, the bidding
sequence was totally dissimilar. (Re-
member the I.C. pair here were sitting
E-W).
N E S W
ID 2S 4D 4S

Dble N o N o N o
East's 2S bid is a weak Roman-
jump overcall, indicating a 2 suited
hand, the bid suit and the next un-
hid suit above it, i n this case spades
and clubs. The subsequent spade calls
cf East and West were sacrifice bids.
When North eventually was "pushed"
into 6D, and East did not double,
West reasoned that the defence was
unlikely to take more than one
trick (in spades), and so he introduced
6S bid, which was promptly doubled.
If East, instead of the club Queen,
held the club Jack, this manoeuvre
would have produced a brilliant re-
sult, for 6D would have then been
makeable for a score of 1370, com-
pared with just 500, E-W only going
3 down in their 6S contract. N-S can
defeat 6S by more than 3 tricks if they
strike at the trump suit straightaway,
so minimising the amout of cross-
ruffing. A s it was, East managed to
cross-ruff heartj and clubs, and ended
up with 9 tricks. Score : plus 500. N-S.
Unfortunately, North has no means
by which to avoid losing a club, as
well as a spade, so the 6S bid was a
phantom sacrifice.

Ambitious Potato
Envelopes Tomatoe
T F Y O U L I K E your food hot, then it's time you
tried Heinz curried beans. Served on rice with,
say, a tin of stewed steak or cuopped pork lun-
cheon meat, you have an interesting and tasty
meal.
If you have access to a little oven, try putting
large potatoes in to bake. T o save you the energy
of scrubbing, you can buy scrubbed " spuds" at
not much more. Put them i n at about 5.00—ac-
cording to their size, (they will take an average of
about three hours mid-heat), then you can fill
them with cream cheese, Dairylea, cottage cheese
or Primula and butter and put them back in. the
oven for a few minutes. If you are ambitiohs,
use the onion, tomato and bacon part of last issue's
recipe, and scoop out the inside, mix all together
and return to the potato shell to rebake.
Anoher idea is to use a concentrated tomato
soup (Campbell's is better than Heinz), and some-
times you win imu a aiuan iin, sumcient tor two
potatoes, at 8d. Heat it slowly in a saucepan, with
a knob of butter, and then pour into the jacket
potatoes.
It's Good Knees
Week
Perhaps it seems a little chilly to recommend
the mini-skirt but there are some very pretty ones
at Peter Robinson. In the fairly new Department
you will find a rail marked "Chelsea Knees,"
ultra short but very pretty plaids in biege and
brown which you can wear with last year's long
white socks. Also the Op-art picture comes in
here, again in thick felt, with a self belt, dark brown
circular motif onto beige or brilliant pink onto
hlack, to mention just two; about 35/11.
If you like the corduroy theme and you are a
trouser girl, I would recommend that you take
a trip to Carnaby Street, King's Road or even your
local men's shop. Steal the boy's pants!!! Have
you ever noticed how smooth the mod-man cut is
and how sneaky the pockets are? Slightly hippy
too, they often look better on Eve than Adam!
Y o u might call them Chelsea bags, bottoms or
just legs. O f course, you may go for tweeds or
jeans, once you get there, but if you ever get to
corduroy you should be able ,to find that delicious
wide, velvety pile kind which never seems to get
into the girls' shops, perhaps because it's selling
anyway on the man-line. Price according to area,
around £4.

At 117 Edgware Road, is Alan Clement's new
R O Y C E M A N S H O P .
R O Y C E has been going for just on twelve
months and Alan claims to be going great guns
with the Modern Young Man.
On looking round his stock, I am not surprised
at his success as some of the most fabulous up-to-
date styles are on show, mainly at slightly lower
prices than one would expect.
Alan tells me that the Tattersall Check Hipster
slacks are all the rage at the moment and these
are available in exceptional designs at under 90/-.
His range of Corduroys is truly amazing with
some fine styles in Corduroy Norfolk Jackets
catching m y eye.
If you are interested in shirts, no better selec-
tion can be found than at R O Y C E . Incidentally,
Alan tells me that he is giving a 10 per cent dis-
count to anv student who shows his Union Card.

nest.
