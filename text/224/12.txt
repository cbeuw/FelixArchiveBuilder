Sennet - NewEditor
" P R A N K F U C H S , a Physics P.G. at
I.C., has been appointed editor of
Sennet in the latest staff shake-up on
the paper. Together with Margaret
Rutterworfh from L.S.E. as co-edior
he will be resposible for the organ of
U L U .
It was only a week ago at a meeting
of the President's Council i n U L U
that Tom McNally, president of U.C.,
moved a motion of no-confidence in
Fuchs as features editor of Sennet.
McNallv quoted from an editorial i n
Sennet written by Fuchs attacking him
for his sympathies towards I.S.C., the
International Students Council. It
was also.alleged that he been a paid
guest at " secret" weekends organised
by F J . S . C , open only to selected stu-
dent union presidents. Both F.I.S.C.
and McNally were prepared to sue
Fuchs unless an official apology was
received from him.
Last year Fuchs attempted to be-
come President of U L U but he was re-
jected in favour of the famed Tony
Berry.
Sennet has had a constant flow of
editors through its offices, the last one.
The new editor of Sennet speak-
ing at the recent I.C. Union
Meeting
Pat Munro, has resigned for academic
reasons. Things got so complicated
last year that at the height of one
battle the fro^t page was devoted to
a " Why I was sacked " and " Why I
sacked her " reposte between president
Tony Berry and the passing editor.
RSM Proves the Point
T AST THURSDAY'S debate on tne motion that " This house believe that
Union Sport Activities are childish and immature," proved a popular
topic and over two hundred turned up at the start of the debate.
Sinclair. Goodlad, the first Arts
Graduate employed by Imperial Col-
lege as a Lecturer, started off with a
witty and entertaining speech which
made one wonder why half the col-
lege had been allowed out of kinder-
garten. Activities of the constituent
colleges were, he said, exemplified by
the actions of the City and.-Guilds
College, having all the trappings of a
primitive religion, a sacred totem and
special costumes for the high priest.
Making no attempt to oendemn these
rituals, he went on to say how neces-
sary somehing of this form is. But
would it not be better if such energies
were used i n running a " Round the
World Race."
Ken Weale, the Union Treasurer,
lecturer i n Chemical Engineering in
his spare time, hif back^ Defending
actions like " Ring o' roses round the
Albert Hall," he himself skipped
round the motion, raising man' laughs,
but rarely coming to grips with it.
Ian Williams, editor of Felix, se-
conding the motion, bumbled into the
microphone looking for all the world
like a lost dog. In the few moments
when he climbed into audibility he
appeared to be attempting a systema-
tic destruction of Goodlad's case.
Ken West, Vice-President of R.C.S.,
explained to an enraptured audience
the delights of being kidnapped and
debagged on Morphy Day without ex-
SMALL AD.
MR. PETER COMBES wishes to
announce that he will not be sending
Christmas Cards this Season.
A CAREER WTTH VSO ? No, but
it's a good start. VSO can't offer you
a career—you serve only on or two
years—but you'll be doing something
worthwhile and you'll learn a tot
about yourself. Write Voluntary Ser-
vice Overseas, 3 Hanover Street, W.l.
plaining the relevance of this «experi-
ence to the motion under debate.
Felix, he complained, was anti-
" sport" this year but " A l l work and
no play makes Jack a dull boy."
A message from the Royal School
'of Mines Union meetingtgoing on at
the same time), was passed up to Ken
Weale, telling h i m that they had
passed a resolution expressing their
support for h i m and promising to
come along en masse and vote at the
end of the debate.
In the closing stages of the debate,
after many good speeches from the
floor, they arrived. They marched int
the concert hall, hard on the heels of
their ritual leader, to vote against the
motion making the outcome of the
vote certain, but providing ample
proof of the truth of the motion by
their action.
J. C A W S O N .
NEW CLUB
r \ A I H O W E L L , President of Guild's,
^ i s proposing to found a new club
or society. The society will be for
sportsmen of outstanding calibre
whom, he feels, do not get enough
recognition. It will also give people
from different constituent Colleges
who participate in different sports a
chance to meet and drink with each
other. He is determined that the
society should not become a "closed
shop " or clique of. people from one
sport. In order to prevent this, the
founder members will be captains of
all the sports. After this start people
who have put tremendous effort into
their particular sports will be elected.
This society will be broader based
than the Oiaps, Links and " 22,"
containing people from all coleges,
and should promote a greater I C
spirit in sporting activities.

mas Turkey Dinner will be served to-

'Observer' sees Mines
"
"
p HURSDAY PRESENTED the
* " Gentlemen of Mines " with one
of the liveliest union meetings for
many years—perhaps to impress the
"Observer's" lady photographer.
As the president, Dick Gash, an-
nounced matters arising, Dick Potts
emerged from under the bench, where,
during the reading of the minutes, he
had kept members in fits of laughter
with appropriate comments and jokes
written on cards.
The Freshers' Pot was presented to
C. Molam, who drank a token pint
in six sees. M r . D . Harkwick pre-
sented the Stevenson Cup to M .
Anstey, captain of Mines Hockey
X V , and then D i c k Gash congratu-
lated Mines Water Polo team for their
win in the Swimming Gala.
Entertainment was supplied when
Nigel Gravette after reporting on the
I . C W . A . O l d Folks' Tea Party, de-
manded to know why Fergus Kerr was
wearing a Cambourne Mining School
tie. Being found guilty of treason,
M r . Kerr was suitably punished.
The meeting closed on a serious
note when Bob Slater informed the
Union of the Conference run by the
International Federation of Mining
and Metallurgy Students to be held
next year, and asked for full support
from the Union.
R . S M . raffle was drawn by the
" Observer" photographer. B.
Woollett won first prize (£2) and B.
Mair second prize (10/-).
CHOIR SUCCESS
Roger Norrington Steps in
THE SUCCESS of the Concert given by the I.C. Choir was due to
Roger Norrington who, after only a few hours notice, undertook
to sing the tenor solos in place of Alistair New hinds, ordered not to
sing by his doctor.
The Concert began with Bach's
•'Christmas Oratorio." The first
Ch>rus "'Christians be J o y f u l " set
tie mood for the evening—one of en-
joyment a n J delight. In this chorus
the tenors sang particularly well, at-
tain ng its high, difficult runs with
extreme lightness and clarity.
' Gillian Hull—contralto—conveyed
the beauty of the aria " Prepare thy-
self, Z i o n " to the audience with a
deep feeling for its words. It was a
disappointment that the bass soloist
was unable to match her quality. The
higher notes of the bass recitations
were not certain enough and the
soloist seemed to run out of breath.
The " K y r i e " opened Rossini's
" Petite Messe Solenelle." This
chorus grew out of an almost imper-
ceptable murmer in the lower orches-
tra to a powerful crescendo with the
full orchestra and choir, and eventu-
ally the choir solo. This piece showed
the choir's fine quality and the expert
control which the conductor, Dr. E. H .
Brown, held Over the whole choir and
orchestra.
The standard attained by the choir
was extremely high, and it was obvi-
ous that the evening had been pre-
ceded by many hours of rehearsals'.
It was an excellent performance en-
joyed by all those present.
M.S.
VIETNAM
O'N D E C E M B E R 2, M r . Frank
- Crump spoke to the Inter-
rational Relations Club about
the war in Vietnam. Mr. Crump,
who is on the staff of the Ameri-
can Embassy in London, out-
lined the development of events,
beginning with the collapse of the
French effort to maintain the re-
gime in Intlo-China in 1954.
A referendum led to the establish-
ment of a republic in South Vietnam,
and for several years the country pro-
grassed, socially and econain caliy.
However, the Diem regime was over-
thrown in 1959, and in the same year
the Viet Cong began systematic ter-
rorism in the country.
Mr. Crump stated very firmly, des-
pite denials from the audience, that
the Viet Cong are none other than an
arm of the North Vietnamese govern-
ment. He claimed that the North had
publicly called for an increase in
guerilla activity in the south.
The Union Quad at 2 a.m. Sunday week after R.C.S. entertauhnente.
