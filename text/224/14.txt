THE PARKINSOITlAN MIRACLE.
In the age of l e i s u r e that i s about to a r r i v e , whether we want I t or
not, w i l l dustmen have to be paid more than Professors? I t i s a f t e r a l l
more fun to be a P r o f f e s s o r .
This was one of the ideas thrown out by P r o f f e s s o r Denis Gabor, FRS,
at the l a s t and one of the most successful meetings of the Huxley Society
t h i s term. The professor, a Hungarian expatriate who came to t h i s country
before the war, was speaking on the theme of the threat of l e sure i n an
automated f u t u r e .
The s o c i a l organism has already performed a Parkansonian m i r a c l e i n
keeping the employment rate f a r below i t s between-the-wars l e v e l , despite
the increasing use of mechanical methods f o r performing routine and repet-
i t i v e jobs. As the percentage of the work-force on the production l i n e s
decreases, the percentage of -blue-collar'workers increases, and the
c o l l e c t i v e waste, i n the form of i n d u s t r i e s l i k e a d v e r t i s i n g , t r a d i n g
stamps, and ever more compulsive consumption, m u l t i p l i e s . T h i s process
must end soon, and society w i l l d i s c o v e r that i t just doesn't need the
labours of a l l but the most g i f t e d part of i t s p o p u l a t i o n .
Professor Gabor has great f a i t h i n the a b i l i t y of human beings to
meet t h i s challenge. Who knows how much c r e a t i v i t y l i e s i n each of us?
D o - i t - y o u r s e l f , a r t i s t i c hobbies of a l l a o r t s , v a s t l y increased education
( i n which he sees l i t t l e place f o r the teaching machine), perhaps even
a return of the p r i m i t i v e 'manufactury', i n which luxury objects are made,
without d i v i s i o n of labour, by people working f o r the love of i t . C e r t a i n l y
W-, s h a l l need a p o p u l a t i o n of stable numbers, not just as a matter of l i f e
and death f o r the poorer countries, but as a matter of keeping our s a n i t y .
Professor Gabor has hard words f o r S c i e n t i s t s and Engineers who
climb ob the band-wagon of b i g Government grants without any conception
of the k i n f of society they are working f o r .
Next term, the Hux Soc w i l l be adressed by more academics who p r e f e r
to shape society r a t h e r than be shaped by i t . These include I.C.s P r o f
Scorer on planning, L i o n e l E l v i n on education and Prof Hermann Bondi on
science and r e l i g i o n ,
