LETTERS TO FELIX
Edited by David Roberts
Fair, free and
open to all? Union = apathetic
Dear Felix,
Is it just me, or is the Union rapid-
ly becoming a "them and us" set-up?
Look at the evidence - who else
has seen the photo of our President in
this year's prospectus? Does the
Union really believe that a rugby
player looking like an extra from Just
William is a true representative of
ICU in 1997? I for one do not feel
represented by this image - I don't
want everyone to believe that ICU is
some "rugger-bugger" extension of
Eton. Could we not have found a pic-
ture that shows the cultural diversity
the Union claims it represents?
The other thing I've noticed from
the two sets of Presidential Elections
this year, and from overhearing
recognised Union types discussing
the candidates, that neither uncon-
tested candidate has been seen as
"suitable" by the established clique.
Ask yourself - would the two New
Election campaigns have been quite
so vigorous had the uncontested can-
didates been from within the
"group"? I'm not entirely sure they
would. When the Union claims to
represent all it's members, how can
so many decisions be made behind
seemingly closed doors?
Or am I just being paranoid?
A Swift (Mech Eng II)
Firstly, the content of the College
prospectus is not under the Union
control. The College do ask the
Union to contribute some material,
but they decide the format them-
selves. Secondly, decisions aren't
made behind locked-doors -
they're made at meetings which
any ICU member is free to observe
- but pitifully few do. The dilemma
is that at present those who do reg-
ularly attend have a strong "hack"
influence, and thus have a strong
desire to concentrate power upon
themselves.
Ms Bunston received an extreme
grilling at Hustings, purely
because yet again the large major-
ity of those attending were from
this group. The problem is how to
break down this pattern - and
make ICU's decision making bod-
ies (primarily Council and Exec)
truly representative of IC students.
Dear Felix,
Having attended the Resident's
Viewing of the drawings for the
Royal Albert Hall's expansion over
the next five years tonight, we are
dismayed to note that no-one from
either Exec, Council, or officers of
ICU as a whole were there to repre-
sent the student body. Given that the
building work will be going on
through each year until 2001 (creat-
ing an excessive amount of noise in
the process) we found it distressing
that the only official representatives
of those affected were the few stu-
dents and odd warden from Beit and
Linstead Halls.
Surely with the planned expansion
to Beit and the Union building fol-
lowing Biology's departure - and
hence large amounts of students
studying here during May and June -
some official presence would be
expected? Is our Union apathetic
enough to ignore the plight of these
students, or is it just another example
of the poor service we receive?
Concerned students of Beit Hall
You are indeed right. There
should have been a representative
of the Union there.
An apology
Dear Felix,
I would like to apologise to Simon
Baker, Alex Feakes and Andy
Thompson for my childish prank in
defacing last week's edition of Felix.
I am a silly twonk and promise never
to do it again.
Yours with deepest regrets,
Antoine
And don't do it again, or you'll be
to bed with no supper. M r Baker
was exceedingly upset.
And finally...
Dear Felix,
I completely agree with your arti-
cle entitled 'Dogs on Campus' on
page 4 of issue 1087 (last week's).
There are far too many, especially
in Geology.
Later,
Edd
I guess that counts as humour
down the Mines.
Letters may edited for content or length.

"Seconds away, round three."
Here we go again. Two weeks of
umming and ahhing by may-be-
might-do candidates before a rush of
last minute nominees dash around
the Union to get their required twen-
ty seconders. It's not a very stable
state of affairs, and not one which
inspires much confidence in the run-
ning of the Union.
Nevertheless, unless a firm candi-
date with firm ideas steps forward,
the students who vote will not like to
see their Union deposited into the
hands of "Oh alright, I'll do it"
President from the Union 'clique'.
The surprisingly high turnout for
this second ballot perhaps emphasis-
es the strength of feeling in this mat-
ter (though not suggesting that Ms
Bunston is part of that 'clique').
Mr Swift, (letters, right) makes
the point that any successful candi-
date requires the blessing of this
'clique' lest they receive the full
blast of an active New Election cam-
paign. I am not sure that this is nec-
essarily true. Previous elections have
been fought between members of
this so-called clique, thus perhaps
nullifying the benefit of being
'anointed'. Additionally, any clique
is a constantly jostling sea of egos,
so two such candidates would be
splitting the 'clique' vote.
This leaves us needing a President
who is not seen to have been put up
to the job and who is strong and
capable. Applications to the nomina-
tion papers opposite the Union
Office.
There are two conflicting strands
here. Mr Swift complains that
unfavoured candidates are the vic-
tims of "vigorous" New Election
campaigns, designed to sway the
floating voters of Imperial College.
But, given that the majority of the
people who vote are 'involved' in
some way with the running of the
Union and therefore know who to
vote for, New Election must influ-
ence very few people. Providing he
has faith in the Union's impartiality
and ability to conduct the elections,
then surely the student's themselves
are capable of deciding who would
do a good job.
What he does get right, though, is
the fact that many decisions seem to
be made behind the Union's closed
door. To a certain extent this is true,
not many people outside the 'clique'
do know what is going on; the blame
lays partly with Felix for not being
broad enough in its coverage, but
mainly with the student officers and
the students they represent.
These meetings are open to all.
Go and see your Union in action and
see if it works!
