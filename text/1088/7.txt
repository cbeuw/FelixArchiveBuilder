F E L I X FRIDAY 2 3 R D M A Y HOW TO MAKE A FELIX 7
...Which is when the real
work starts.
While most of you are out get-
ting some flying time in or
your shins kicked, Felix moves
up a gear. The columnists
scribe their columns, the pho-
tographers develop photos
and the design and lay-up
people start to panic...

fine point.
^ Felix works late into
Wednesday night, endur-
ing dB's disco and the
vagaries of mid-week
revellers.
• But eventually, the
work gets done and sent
to the paste-up desk.
Matthew is sporting the
latest in summer wear as
he delicately smooths the
edges of a page.
...From the paste-up desk
the pasted-up sheets go
to the camera room where
an aluminium plate is
made for the press.
Thursday comes and the
presses roll, taking twelve
hours to print all of Felix.
After the ink has dried,
the pages are fed into the
collator for stapling. Then,
the finished copies myste-
riously appear inside
your department...
' 'iX. •
mucking around on computers we do to place the
text, the lines and the pictures just right. Design is
the term given to the creative mucking around in
our heads we do to decide where that text, lines
and pictures should go. To achieve this, we use
the industy-standard software packages
OuarkXpress and Adobe Photoshop. If only the
entire process was so modern and simple...
...But it isn't! After the page is
completed to the satisfaction of
the sub-editor, it is proofed
(although the occasional error
does get through). Finally, the
page goes to the paste-up desk
to be readied for the press...
\
The presses yesterday. Felix gets
through 250,000 sheets of paper
every couple of months.
• The finished product. Easy innit!
