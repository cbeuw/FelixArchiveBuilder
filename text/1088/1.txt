New Election wins again

The second outing for the ballot
boxes this year saw a surprisingly
large turnout despite a lacklustre
campaign from the candidates. An
overwhelming preference was
expressed in favour of reopening
nominations for the position of ICU
President.
The result was announced in Da
Vinci's on Tuesday evening, to the
largely uninterested masses compet-
ing in the Bar Quiz. The declaration
was delayed when the returning offi-
cer, current ICU President Eric
Allsop, was unable to find Clare
Bunston. Over 600 students came out
against the single candidate, with Ms
Bunston receiving just 123 votes.
On hearing the news of her com-
prehensive defeat, Ms Bunston's
only comment was "New Election
won easily", before leaving the
Union Building with her boyfriend
Luke Moralis, a defeated candidate
from last year's Presidential
Election. Before the result was
announced, Ms Bunston rejected the
idea that she might be stressed, insist-
ing that "I'm one of those people
who believe in fate."
Nomination Papers were posted
for the second re-run at 9.30am on
Wednesday morning, with the con-
stitution specifying that the must stay
up for ten College days. With a Bank
Holiday during following fortnight, it
looks likely that the election cam-
paign itself will be limited the subse-
quent to seven days, with voting
around the 16th and 17th June.
When Felix went to press, two
candidates had already signed up.

RCSU, has also signed his name, but
had no proposer or seconders on
Thursday afternoon. Paul Brown,
currently IC Radio Station Manager,
has confirmed that his PhD supervi-
sor had agreed to let him take a year
out from his studies, and was seri-
ously considering standing.
Other candidates who may yet put
themselves forward include Omar
Kheir, who withdrew from the first
Presidential election. He denied that
he would be a candidate for the June
ballot, but suggested that he would
be a nominee "not next time, but the
time after that." Both Al Hussein,
one of the two candidates who with-
drew from this election, and Guarav
Misra, another object of speculation,
were unavailable for comment as
Felix went to press.
With the Mary's vote falling by
74%, Sami Ansari, the St Mary's
Student Union President, commented
that the SU did not put pressure on
members to vote in a particular man-
ner, but "let it drift." This was despite
reports that second year students had
been heavily pressurised into voting
for New Election. Mr Ansari also
pointed to the fact that many 3rd and
4th year students are away from col-
lege on electives and that others cur-
rently have exams.
The leader of the medics empha-
sised that inter-campus wrangling
was of lesser importance to "getting
as much as we can from admin", and
that Imperial College needs "a very
