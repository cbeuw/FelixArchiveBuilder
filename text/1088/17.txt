F E L I X FRIDAY 2 3 R D M A Y COLUMNS 1 7
NOTE: The views expressed here
are not necessarily those of the
Editor or Imperial College Union.
Come to think of it, they may not
even be the views of the author, it
would seem.
Having just got the biggy out the
way, a further raft of elections has
descended upon us, namely the
Conservative leadership contest and
the ICU equivalent. One of these is
of direct relevance to students at
Imperial, and the other one will pick
the Union President. As for the for-
mer, most of the news has been taken
up by the unprecedented spat
between Anne Widdecombe and
Michael Howard. It is true to say that
this is precisely what the Party
wished to avoid, despite the unques-
tioned amusement value of 'Doris
Karloff describing Howard as hav-
ing 'something of the night about
him', but I must confess that the end
result will probably be beneficial.
Make no mistake, Michael Howard
is an adept politician, a point that
even his most ardent opponents
would endorse. The problem is that
he is deeply unpopular with the
British people, and consequently
would consign the Conservatives to a
hefty stretch in opposition. What is
needed is a popular, but not necessar-
ily populist, leader. Principle is often
sacrificed at the altar of populism, as
Simon Baker
has been witnessed in New Labour
(though you can't argue with their
election strategy!). Moreover, the
party needs a uniting leader. Given
the shift in the
party on Europe,
one would con-
clude that a
'right-winger'
was needed,
eliminating Ken
Clarke. This
left-right Europe
divide is
immensely dam-
aging. Not for
the reason you
would expect
me to say, but
from the stand-
point that if you
are on the left-
wing of the
Conservative
Party you must y Q ^ g Q f
be a rampant
federalist, contrasted with the right
where nothing short of leaving the
EU will do, or so people say. Both
are, of course, ludicrous proposi-
tions. The European issue should not
divide Tories into two wings. One
Nation Toryism is not in principle
against defending British sovereign-
ty, for example. An acknowledge-
ment of the value of the Single
Market with a scepticism of relent-
less harmonisation and integration
for their own sakes should unite all
the party, not bitterly divide it. That
said the split is much less evenly bal-
anced than
before the elec-
tion. Taking all
that into
account, my
money's on
William Hague.
reason
The other elec-
tion will have
been decided by
the time that you
read this, which
is why I can say
what I am about
to. After the
stunning victory
of New Election
last time, only
one candidate
dared to face
this fearsome
opponent. Other commitments pre-
vented me from attending the hus-
tings, but last week's cover story and
Andrew Dorman-Smith's character-
istically excellent interview tell us
enough to be going on with. My con-
clusion? God help us. Previous can-
didates at least had the decency not to
believe in their crazy platforms (such
as the brothel proposal), but this has
the smack of sincerity. As for the
actual manifesto, the constant change
and evasion makes Tony Blair look
positively intransigent. Furthermore,
saying that you are not in a position
to understand fully your principal
campaign pledge is laudably honest
but displays an aptitude for own-foot
target shooting previously only seen
in Sherfield. One point did shine
through, which could go down well
with the powers that be. Our candi-
date's stance on the medical schools
exactly mirrors the College manage-
ment strategy, namely give 'em
whatever they want. At a time when
there is a genuine fear that the 'old'
College will very much play second
fiddle to the new medical boys and
girls, we have a Union Presidential
candidate, who clearly feels the same
way. If Sherfield feared Union trou-
ble-making over the mergers, their
prayers may well have been
answered. Then again, New Election
could make it two on the trot. I, how-
ever, do not predict election out-
comes.
And finally, let us join together and
wish my old sparring partner Ian
Caldwell a happy 43rd birthday.
Though 43 is not one of the big land-
marks, like 40, it is most definitely
worth celebrating in style. Come to
think of it Ian, if you're looking to
hold a big party, I have just the
venue...

"ow refreshing to
be able to write
-about a Labour
scandal for once.
Mohammed Sarwar, the
millionaire Labour M P
for Glasgow Govan, has
been accused of giving £5000 to Badar Islam, an
Independent Labour candidate, for toning down his
campaign against Sarwar and concentrating his
efforts on the other candidates. A second candi-
date, Peter Paton, standing as an unofficial Labour
candidate, has complained to the police about Mr
Sarwar's bribery.
Glasgow Govan was one of the most bitterly
fought seats this election, with Labour and the
Scottish National Party battling it out in this and
many other seats in Scotland. Mohammed Sarwar
has previously been embroiled in scandal, when
the internal Labour election for his candidacy of
Glasgow Govan had to be re-run due to irregulari-
ties in recruiting party members just before the
election.. Labour have not wasted any time in deal-
ing with this, promising to discipline Mr Sarwar,
possibly to the extent of expelling him from the
party if he is charged. If he were convicted, he
would be expelled from the House of Commons.
Mr Sarwar for his part denies any wrongdoing, and
is consulting his solicitors for a defamation case.
The Conservative Party are not surprisingly
keeping quiet for the moment, since their scandal
record is a little to 'impressive' for them to claim
Labour corruption. Of course their isn't any great
internal party corruption in Labour, nor is there
much in the Conservative Party itself - rather than
it operating as a government. Power breeds corrup-
tion, and Labour have not had the chance to be
properly corrupt yet (although their local authority
record is rather worrying). In the Sarwar case, Mr
Dewar, the Scottish Secretary, has asked the
Advocate-General to investigate the case, taking it
far higher than it would be done usually. All the
relevant people got their
say too, with the Home
Secretary, Jack Straw say-
ing that with a breach of|
parliamentary rule, the law
would have to take its
course. The Chief Whip
(responsible for discipline
among other things in the
party) informed Mr Sarwar
that no disciplinary action
would take place yet.
Of course Labour can do
without this sort of scandal
occurring so soon in a par-
liamentary term, but Blair
will have to accept it as
part of the job as Prime
Minister. If Mohammed
Sarwar was charged and
expelled from the party or
the Commons, it may work
to Labour's advantage in showing that they are pre-
pared to keep their own house clean, having spent
so much effort in criticising the Conservatives'. Mr
Sarwar may find himself as a victim of a zealous
Labour administration, but allegations of corrup-
tion in a General Election, even if for only one seat
are one of most fundamentally serious that can be
made, and if it was true, most of the Commons,
including Labour Members, will be glad to see the
back of him.

Beyond the blue horizon,
Lies an island filled with pain,
An island frought with discord,
Where dark depression reigns.
The journey to this island,
Filled with pleasure and delight,
Is short, and soon forgotten,
Once the island is in sight.
Your arrival there is sudden,
And the time spent there so cruel,
Here, self-pity, all pervading,
Turns all sane men to fools.
Though departure may be possible,
The timings dim and distant,
So pack for the duration,
For the island is insistent.
