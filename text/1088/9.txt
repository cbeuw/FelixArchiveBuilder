This crime novel is odd. Right from the start we know who
the perpetrator was, indeed he admits "Fact: I did it". After
reading his negative school reports, he sets about to
commit "acts of revision", getting even on his teachers of
so long ago. His mental state throughout is questionable -
drawing continual cartoons and living in the loft (ala
Shallow Grave) cannot be normal, however it is unsurpris-
ing considering considering the aura of death that always
hovers around him.
As the perpetrator commits his crimes, we travel with
him, seeing how
the teachers
teased him in
class or how
they were the
shattered idol of
his wet dreams.
On this journey
we see flashes
of his family life;
sister whom he
idolised, father
whom he wor-
shiped and
mother whom
he misses the
most.
It is hard to tell
where exactly
his unbalanced
mental state
originates from;
the novel gives a
constant juxta-
position
between family
and schooling
trauma, within which it is impossible to place exact
motives. What is clear is the perpetrator's self-centred-
ness, "Yours are the only stories that interest you" and
'They were out there, people of importance...because of
me" being Iwo prime quotes which sum up much of the
Acts of Revision
Martyn Bedford
criminal's attitude.
Ultimately this book is
subtler than merely being
a diatribe of violence.
Through school experience, it explores the way nothing
can be absolute.
For example an
electron is both a
particle and a
wave - both
these statements
are correct. This
is a lesson many
of those at IC
would do well to
heed; "the
obsession with
facts" is not the
only way of think-
ing.
This novel is
well written and
a flowing read -
however it does-
n't live up for one
moment to the
screaming blurb
on the front
cover. "Wildly
funny" - not at all,
"A disturbing
amount to think
about" - well, maybe a bit, but not much. I just didn't con-
nect with this at all. Unless you love the idea of wreaking
havoc with those bastard teachers' lives, steer deer of this
and spend the money on an art exhibition or two to
counter all those IC facts. Hot Lips

What? You don't have this already? Waddya mean why
are we reviewing this in May? Sorry, but we were laugh-
ing too much. Anyway, here we are now, with a quick
shuftie of the best of 1996 by that fourth pillar of British
Society, Private Eye.
Did you miss the spat between Di and Julia Carling,
Michael Gummer's daughter's famous burger or Sir
Jammy Fishpaste and his electioneering? Well, there's no
need now as its all been brought together between two
bits of card. This book serves equally well as a coffee
table entree, a last-thing at night thriller or a bathroom
laxative and gives the absentee a potted history of the
previous year's news.
It's better than The Economist's review of the year, fun-
nier than "that look on Portillo's face" and cheaper than
three pints in the Queens'. So get out there and buy sev-
eral copies; one for yourself, one for each of your family
and one for the dog, you won't forget it (and my shares in
PE will go up, up, up]!
