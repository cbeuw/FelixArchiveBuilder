20 SPORT F E L I X FRIDAY 23RD M A Y
FELIX SPORT
Nice yacht, but too many punters
Course Croisiere EDHEC (CCE) is
the biggest student event in Europe.
Originally just a student regatta, C C E
now includes the Trophee Terre, an
event involving a multitude of land-
based sporting activities, as well as a
recruitment fair for the sponsors who
take advantage of some 6000 stu-
dents present, including those from
EDHEC (Ecole Des Hautes Etudes
Commerciales du nord) who organ-
ise the whole event as a final year
project.
The regatta itself is open to four
main classes - two handicap fleets,
for which almost any boat from
seven to fourteen metres is eligible,
and three one design fleets of 1st
Class 8s, Beneteau Figaros and JOD
35s. Although some of the event is
pure fun, the sailing is of a very high
standard, especially in the highly
competitive JOD 35 fleet, of which
ICU Yacht Club formed part. Many
of the JODs featured professional
skippers and tacticians and large
sponsors, with the top two or three
boats using the regatta as training for
the highly prestigious Tour de
France a la Voile, a six week yacht-
ing marathon around the entire
French coast - the culmination of
France's most exiting one-design cir-
cuit.
ICYC performed with surprising
success as we recorded results of
between eighth and sixteenth out of
forty all week. Unfortunately, the
first day's racing proved to be our
undoing. Falling foul of a subtlety of
the class rules, we were binned for
both races for using too many crew-
members. At least we got our own
back on the crew which had protest-
ed against us, beating them consis-
tently for the rest of the week. One of
the best races of the regatta was off-
shore and at night. Nothing quite
beats flying a spinnaker in the dark as
you watch the navigation lights of
210 other yachts over a six mile
course, wondering just how many of
them you are beating. This night race
ended with a light show to Ride of the
Valkyries, to welcome the fleet
home.
On shore we all took advantage of
the amusements provided by our
amazingly forgiving hosts (usually
free beer for a few hours after the rac-
ing). A big top had been hired for the
evenings, where helicopter coverage
was displayed on huge screens high
lighting the day's successes and the
many cock ups at the backs of the
fleets. This was followed by contin-
ued partying until at least three,
attempting to dispel the common
belief that the French club scene is
still useless, with a bass system
which managed to produce ripples in
the water. Our ranks were usually
swelled by a vast influx of tourists,
locals and supporters.
Our plans for next year's C C E are
already under way, with ICYC look-
ing at returning with the JODs if we
secure a sponsor or else in the
Phillips Whirlpool Figaros if we
can't. Either way, if you think you
can spare a week in the Easter hols,
know anything about boats, pulling
French women or would like to have
an opportunity to learn, there will be
plenty of space next year. We would
like to enter a land team, and will
need a larger group so that ICYC can
man a sponsor's stand and have a
party crew to take over when we real-
ly do need to go to bed!
Training restarts next term with the
Hamble winter series for the racers
and regular cruising weekends for the
lazy gits. Contrary to popular belief,
sailing is cheap so there's no excuse.
Look out for the display on the
Walkway for details.
Duck: another cricket cock-up
G R A H A M
Having convinced ourselves that
QMW I's "can't be THAT good,"
the match started with them dispatch-
ing us for 35 off the first five overs.
A plague of bungled catches and
clumsy fielding followed and soon
enough, Q M W had notched up a
century for hardly any wickets.
However, due to a combination of
firey pace, tricky spin bowling and
piss-poor bowling they slumped to
130 for 8. Sadly our renewed opti-
mism was short-lived when Q M W
staged an annoying eighth wicket
stand of about 70. We finally skittled
them out for 206.
Our innings started with a strong
opening partnership of 2 and got
gradually worse, with the score at 30
for 5 our hopes of victory grew slim.
But, Michael took Pete's helpful
advice which was, "Don't stand there
and defend the ball, twat it over the
boundary!" to heart and cleaved a
rapid 47. Poor fielding and repeated
shouts of "Mine mine ... Oh SHIT,"
plus some dainty cow-corner work
by Ruggy left us at a respectable 105
all out. Never mind lads.
