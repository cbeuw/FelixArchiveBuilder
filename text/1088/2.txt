The]
Candidate
Third Presidential race candidates
continued from front page
strong President." Sami denied sug-
gestions that he himself would be a
candidate insisting that "I've had
enough, it's time to return to study."
He did admit however that he had
heard "rumours" that a medic might
stand for the post of ICU President
but that he "doubts" whether a candi-
date will come forward from
St.Mary's.
Sympathy for the defeated candi-
date came from Sarah Thomas who
said: "I really do feel for her and
know how hard it is, to run a cam-
paign and lose." She went on to
describe the embarrassment of fail-
ure and "having it broadcast college
wide - it's horrible." Ms Thomas, the
losing candidate in the March
DP(C&S) race, discouraged specula-
tion as to her being a candidate in
June commenting that "after last time
I think that it's time to get out."
Paul Brown, IC Radio Chair and
an ICU Council member, also
expressed compassion for Ms
Bunston saying, "I think that it's a
shame, I think that she did quite a
good campaign." Mr Brown suggest-
ed that her defeat could be accounted
for by her reticence in expressing her
own convictions saying, "I think that
if she hadn't been quite so un-opin-
ionated she would have been all
right."
It is unclear what would happen if
New Election were to win for a third
successive time in June, with sugges-
tions that the current ICU President
would be asked to act as a 'care-taker
President' for the Summer. Mr
Allsop confirmed that he would
probably accept such a request say-
ing, "I'm quite prepared to give as
much assistance as I possibly can",
but insisting that he would prefer to
return to his PhD.
Election
Analysis
Since 'New Election' was introduced
for the 1989 sabbatical election, stu-
dents have called for the re-opening
of nominations only twice. Before
1989 the only way to register protest
as to the quality of the candidates
was by voting as an 'abstention'.
The most recent time that a candi-
date failed to get elected in the Spring
Elections was in 1993 when Max
Jalil trailed New Election by 145
votes (727 to 582). This poll was the
old position of Hon Sec (Events),
before the two separate Deputy
President positions were created.
In the June 1993 rerun Charles
Leary, who had withdrawn from the
March election, took the position
with one of the lowest every
turnouts, managing to gather only 82
votes. This was enough to see him
home as New Election only managed
to a measly 32 first preferences.
The 1990 election for the Deputy
President post was won by New
Election as well, when the single
candidate was rejected by a margin
of 103 (603 to 500). Ben Turner suf-
fered a similar fate to Max Jalil when
St Mary's powered in with over 170
votes for reopening of nominations.
However Mr Turner was election
the following May when he over-
came two other candidates, Spenser
Land and Graeme Littler, in another
low turnout. This time less than 400
votes were cast, but with New
Election managing just 40 first pref-
erences, Ben secured victory after the
first reallocation.
Records were smashed last March
when Sam Baker suffered an incred-
ible defeat at the hands of a 'well
organised' New Election campaign.
Over 1,000 students cast their votes
favour of the RON, and this easily
surpassed Ms Baker's paltry total of
144 first preferences.
Medics' power-sharing deal in doubt
EDWARD SHIRMAN
The new Imperial College School of
Medicine (ICSM) students' union
looks set for a difficult Summer term
after the two students standing for the
presidency of St Mary's Student
Union were disqualified earlier this
week on academic grounds. The
announcement that the candidates'
'academic standing' was unaccept-
able to the Mary's Dean was made at
the Medical School's Annual
General Meeting on Wednesday.
It had previously been agreed
between the two main elements of
the prospective ICSM, St Mary's and
Charing Cross & Westminster
Medical Schools, that even though
Mary's is the smaller college its pres-
ident would act as overall president
of the medics. Charing Cross and
Westminster also have a sabbatical
President and sources from the
Hammersmith based medical school
have suggested that they may now
push for the lead role in the new
ICSMSU.
Nick Carter was elected earlier this
week as Student Union President of
Charing Cross and Westminster
Medical School, along with Vice-
Presidents Oliver Dale (Internal) and
Andy Heeps (External). On a slightly
lower turnout from last year, Vikram
Dahr was chosen as Secretary and
Sally Price as Treasurer.
Next year's Royal School of
Mines Union Executive is also now
known, with the only candidate,
David Bowers, scooping the position
of President with all of 68 votes.
Also elected were Martyn
Buttenshaw, with exactly the same
number of votes as Mr Bowers, and
Kirstin MacKinnon, who had the
largest appeal, managing 80 first
preferences.
Alex Ashworth scraped in as Pit
Editor, with the largest new election
vote against him. The influential post
of Academic Affairs Officer will be
jointly filled by Debbie Middleton
and Ewan Laurie, who secured 60
votes in their victory.
