In preparation for our summer trekking expedition to the
Pyrenees, we decided to organise a practice trip to the
(somewhat more rolling) South Downs.
We set off on Saturday morning from Newhaven with
full backpacks, for a strenuous weekend of hiking and
camping. Conditions and scenery had absolutely no
resemblance whatsoever to our ascent
of Nevis at Easter - at least until it start-
ed pissing it down with rain and the
wind got up.
We reached Plumpton in the late
afternoon when the weather had
finally started to clear up a bit.
Here we followed the trend set
by a certain esteemed Estates
manager from SW7 with a
penchant for canvas, and
pitched our tents. (Although
we did give our members
at least 48 hours warning).
Dinner consisted of a
dehydrated Chicken
Supreme, which turned
out to be a very novel
usage of the word
supreme.

sunny, but with an incessant strong wind. Appropriately
enough it was National Windmills Day,
and we stopped to lunch outside the "Jill"
windmill near Hassocks. Remind me to
make alternative arrangements for
National Sewage Works Day.
By the time we reached Burgess
Hill station, we had covered a
respectable 22 miles. We may
not have had the most repre-
sentative experience of long-
distance tracking at high-alti-
tude in a hot climate, but at
least the night under can-
vas will help us to feel a
little more prepared for
our exams.
