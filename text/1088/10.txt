' â€¢ ^ Festival time is soon
going to be upon us
though unfortunately James may
have to pull out of their only appearance
this year at V97 in Chelmsford. It seems as
ihough Tim Booth, lead singer of the band,
hurt his neck after his manic on stage antics.
Oasis have become the first band to censor
the growing number of fans' websites dedicat-
ed to them on the Internet. The group's man-
agement company are working with the official
Oasis Homepage to ensure unofficial websites
carrying copyrighted lyrics, sound files and
photographs comply with their requirements.
Primal Scream have finally confirmed that
their summer tour is to go ahead. However,
the original intention of a national big tent tour
has been abandoned after local licencing laws
proved insurmountable, although the London
and Glasgow dates will be held in big top
tents.
Urusei Ycrtsura were forced to cancel a gig
in Bari, a port town in Southern Italy, after
death threats from the local Mafioso last week.
Guitarist Graham Kemp said, it was going to
be a communist gig, but the Mafia gave the
guy who booked
the gig a message ]
j ^ f n y g s a y i n q
* that if it
went
ahead,
IThis
communist band
from Scotland would be in danger'. So basical-
ly to avoid getting shot, we decided to pull it.'

TRICKY
Shepherds Bush Empire
I clamber out of the mens. There's a band on
stage, and as it begins to strike me that ifs not
the band that was there when I left, they
launch into a soul-shatteringly perfect rendition
of Overcome. Tricky had arrived.
Weird gig. Stung somewhat by the stigma of
going to the Empire alone when my plus one
plussed out, I'd parked myself into the
shadows at the back of the stalls
and settled into a couple of
melancholy beers. Gazim
around as the place fillec
up I'd become increas-
ingly aware of my own
monadic state against
the apparent eupho-
ria-in-companionship
of others.
It was with such a
sinking mood that I
missed almost entire-
ly the support act,
encased in my own
thoughts. What little I
saw did not impress,
though since the wooden
platform on which I sat res-
onated in excess of the PA's
ample output, it would be only
charitable to note that I was unable to
hear them in their full glory. For Tricky, I took to
the floor proper.
Everything you'd ever expected/demanded
of Tricky, everything Maxinque lead you to
believe you deserved only to be thwarted by
Pre-Millenium Tension, everything was here
tonight, in spades - gravedigger's spades. It
was dark, it brooded, it rang the halls with
crunching basslines as Martine floated angeli-
cally above (pointedly dissapearing off stage
for the more evil bits). Occasionally returning to
'old favourites' like Black S/ee/it dealt
mainly with songs from Tension, but
bending them about each other
to suit the moment, currying
songs together with remark-
able ease. The crowd
were lost, and took to
swaying to the chaos,
not dancing to it.
It strikes me in reflec-
tion how strangely cyli-
cal the gig was, with
the recently released
Makes Me Wanna Die
being revisited several
times during the night,
each with more bezerk
energy from an increas-
ingly agitaed Triky (half the
crowd in front of me and I still
felt threatened). I've never seen
a man's head move from shoulder
to shoulder that fast and by the end
(strange relief when it came) his trashing of the
drums was less a cliche, more a concession.
He could have eaten them. Scary, but ultimate-
ly compelling stuff.

Monkey Mafia - 15 Steps EP
Appealing dance track, reminiscent of the
early Chemical Brothers, bul with less flair.
Later tracks are more original and hold interest
better than the main mix.
Cecil - Red Wine At Dead Time
Apart from an introduction sounding like the
Smurfs gone punk, this is a decent, solid track
with all the edges smoothed off, perhaps this
is why it sounds a little too dated.
Peter BrurttneU - Have You Seen That Girt
Again
Slow, smooth, dated and boring; with an irri-
tating air raid siren hidden in the background
and vocals recorded straight from the bath-
room. ^ Q B H t a j j j i g H p M
Kaleef - Trials Of Life
Growing up as a street wise teenager is tough,
so Kaleef remind us again, and again. They
need a few lessons from Arrested
Development - they know how to write a cho-
rus at least.
Midget - Welcome Home Jellybean
Somewhat like Bis crossed with Ash. Sugar
coated teen pop with grit inside, but too youth-
ful and inexperienced to hold interest for long.
E s s e n t i a l C h o o n
Grass Show - Freak Show
Not as bouncy or radio friendly as the last
Swedish band to hit our charts. However,
close harmonies and an uncanny resem-
blance to Weezer makes for a catchy little
ditty.
Sonia
David Oevant And His Spirit Wife - This Is For
Real
Kooky pop from an innovative band. A bit ster-
ile in the studio, but a must live.
White Buffalo - Love Me Tonight
Bastard child of Live and Counting Crows? Well
worth a listen.
Morphine - Murder For Money
Gritty industrial US trio hit the right spot with
bass, drums and baritone sax.
Darren Price - Lose No Time
Iffy dance. Repetitive synted noise, but then
isn't ft all?
Union Wireless -1 Never Dream
Thinly spread earthy drum and bass. Not really
very good.
World Party - Beautiful Dream
Cheerful but uninspiring melodic vocals/gui-
tar/plano affair.
The Driven - Monkey In A Cage
Solid rock with hard vocals and packaged in a
funky vinyl style sleeve.
