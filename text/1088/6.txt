6 HOW TO MAKE A FELIX F E L I X FRIDAY 2 3 R D M A Y
Come on. Admit it. You must've wondered at some
point in time how the sheets of paper in your hand
go from being young, innocent trees to the quality
printed matter that you're now reading. For exam-
ple, how does Felix get produced? Who writes it?
How does it magically appear in piles just inside
my department every Friday morning?
Well, we can't answer for the lumberjacks, but
when Friday comes, it goes something like this...
• Often,
Friday can't
even start
until Robin
has had his
daily one-
pound curry.
3 &
...It's lunchtime and the dedicated
Felix hacks begin to assemble.
Fridays see the Art & Theatre, Film
and Music sub-editors meeting
their teams to hand out items for
review. Elsewhere, the intrepid
newsteam gather for their
preliminary meeting...
• The music reviewers have a laugh at the latest release by Katrina and the Waves.
.Anyone can help out in the production of Felix and there
are numerous ways to get involved. The reviewers go away
and listen to the music, watch the play or film, then write a
review. These are edited and layed-up by the sub-editor...
• Being insecure arty types, we
name all our computers and give
them personalities. 'Express' for
example is a young dominatrix.
.. .The newsteam meet
again on Monday evening
to check the progress of
their assignments and to
receive and new material.
Reviewers get a week,
whereas the newsteam's
deadline is Wednesday...
