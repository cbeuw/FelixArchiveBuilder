10 FELiX
VARIATION
ON A THEME
In this offering of our Supple-
ment to the Psychopatic News we
approach Christmas, or shall I rather
say, we a^eak up on i t carefully from
behind - anticipating those joyous
festivities which terminate in the
Traditional Boxing Day Feast of two
fried aspirins on toast.
While i n festive vein, one of my
most regular patients (thanks to Sludge,
the wonder breakfast food) - gave m
e the
following offering •-
"Yuletide logs?" said the surgeon
Hacking through some guts,
"They're just the thing at Xmas
For bolting down with nuts".
This, of course, i s the classical
approach along with Dickens, Plum Pudd-
ing, bleary l i t t l e Robins squatting i n
backyards, stage-coaches, hangovers etc.
etc. It is this very classical approach
observed by a l l true green-blooded Brit-
ishers which puzzles the foreign visitor,
particularly i f he i s from abroad, or
some other country, as many foreign
visitors are.
First of a l l , they are puzzled by
the Xmas tree. Who, says the Oriental,
but an idiot, would go out into the
woods, dig down or cut up a tree, load
it s t i l l filthy into the back of the
Hells, take i t h
o
m
e and stick i t into
a flour pot in the dining room? I f
you want to hang up present on some-
thing like this, what is wrong with a
tame elk - the hocks come with the set.
The true story of the Xmas tree
goes back (like the Editors) into a
dim and merky past f u l l of legend and
myth. It developed from a habit of the
Ancient Britons and Picts who used
woad to paint themselves. A famous Scot
advised them to keep right on, which
they did, and got to the end of the woad.
As a result, in the coldest 3eason of
the year the A;B. and P. were caught
with a lack of. Hence they took in
f i r trees, on the mistaken assumption
that the farthest branch woads would
then be accessible.
Christmas Pudding i s well known to
Indians, of course, for i t was invented
in the Far East. It was served up, as
a protestation against British rule to
the High Commissioner for India by a
Ragput, Ewe Go Ram. On being told that
i t was a protestation, the High Commiss-
ioner remarked "delicious". Christmas
Protestation and custard soon became the
standard meal at this time of year. (The
custom of setting fire to the brandy
over the pudding derives from the same
sauce - "send him a flaming protestat-
ion"). Corruption has led to i t s being
called a "pudding" which i s a pity.
"Mince pies" also have an interest-
ing history dating back to the Hpper
Silesian of Wessex. This is another
corruption, this time of the phrase
"minced spies" - a delicacy enjoyed
by the Kings of Wessex, on the principle
that i f you are wrapped around a spy,
he can only inform i n you, but not on
you.
And so the l i s t continues, a
pageant of history and lies, from Box-
ing Day, (the day when every good Roman
handed his box in) through to New Year's
Eve (or as i t i s called in Scotland
"Havemany") the time for making resol-
utions, which I advice you a l l to do
including -
1 ) To buy every issue of Felix,
2) Never to read "Sig" again
this to save m
e work.
3) To do only what your metabolism
prompts you to do.
This last is intended to keep St.
George's Hospital in business as our
friends.
