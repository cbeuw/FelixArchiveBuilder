There ia a very large number of
variables which affeot attraction , as
i s discussed in the literature. A cur-
rant theory states that the initial
attraction is, as a rir3t approximation
a function of the body forces, which .are
isually expressed in terms
of three variables. The purpose of
this paper i s to show that by *he use
of dimensional analysis these variables
oan be combined into a dimensionless
group , or number. -This number oan be
used as a basis for comprrison and dis-
cussion, and can be correlated with ex-
perimentally determined coefficients of
attraction.
Let the variables be denoted by
W and H respectively. Each has the
dimension of length, and for strong
attraction B should be much larger than
W, and also H should be larger than W.
Choosing that an increase in the at-
traction coefficient corresponds to an
increase in the value of the dimen-
sionless group, this group can be de-
fined as
It i s suggested that, following
scientific custom, this number should
be named after a well-established and
f
rominent contributor to this work
o.f. Reynolds, Mach, Prandtl etc.)
and this number will hereafter be cal-
led the Monroe Number, Mo.
The Monroe number can be readily
measured at any time for individual
specimens, and since i t i s dimension-
less i t i s possible to compare values
regardless of whether the units of
measurement are inches or centimetres,
provided the units are consistent.
This facilitates ready comparison be-
tween English and Continental specimens.
The coefficient *i attraction i s
defined as the probability of general
positive or approving response amongst
Male specimens. This can be statisti-
cally determined for various values of
Mo., both from direct experiment and
by inference from published data. In
this way, the coefficient of attraction
can be found as a function of Mo.
Recent workers i n this field (cf.Sab-
rina, Mansfield) have enabled data to
be obtained for very high values of Mo.
It i s well known that Mo. for a
particular specimen i s a function of
the age of that specimen. Between
the ages of 10 and 20 years Mo rises
significantly, and after attaining a
peak value falls slowly through the
life of the specimen, tho.gh the rate
of decay may increase by a high dissi-
pation coefficient. By correlating
the coefficient of attraction with age,
the ages of Hope and Despair can be
found.
Many specimens are known to att-
snpt to alter their attraction co-
sfficient bj a r t i f i c i a l means. Now,
>
y calculating the effects on their
ipparent Mo. i t i s possible to decide
letween, say, an increment of B or a
ecrement of W, and consequently base
uch alterations on established data.

Which really when you think a while,
