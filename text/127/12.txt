I.C.W.S.C.
After several years of much corre-
spondence, we have arranged to visit
Delft University t h i s Christmas. Despite
the Post Office attractions, we are tak-
ing teams f o r hockey, netball, swimming,
tennis, table-tennis and badminton. We
expect to play our matches on four days
and spend two days sight-seei-\-. ^?e
have already had many male volunteers
for masseurs, trainers etc., but, alas,
our grant i s for I.C.W.S.C. only. How-
ever, we would appreciate a ceremonial
send-off from Liverpool Street Station
about 8 - CO a.m. on Monday 15 December.
SWIMMING
We have again, since very few
freshers are w i l l i n g to take to water,
entered the U.L.W.S.C. League with
Middlesex Hospital. This year, the
League has two sections, and we, after
our e f f o r t s l a s t year are in the f i r s t
section. So f a r we have won two matches
and l o s t one.
This i s mainly due to E l i z a b e t h
F e r r i s , the Olympic d i v e r who i s ir. her
f i r s t year at Middlesex H o s p i t a l . Her
standard of swimming i s much above the
r e s t of the team. Unfortunately, I.C.
W.S. e f f o r t i s r e s t r i c t e d to a few
old f a i t h f u l s , - i t would be pleasing
i f freshers could remember t h e i r
Freshers Reception cromiae. Nevertheless
- I think t at we s h a l l do w e l l i n the
League - i f not by our e f f o r t s .
TABLE - TENNIS
The table tenn-is team has laved
three matchee t i£ term's next te cm they
hone to win at l e a s t one match.
HOCKEY
Ii. f i r s t match we were :c:i-
v i n c i n g l y beaten 5 - Q by ILLngs II. The
team wa-j .acre p r a c t i s e 1 and f i t t e r f o r
•.he match against Chelsea Poly I, a
draw resulted. The next match we
defeatedBirkbeck I, 4 - mainly
because of a .much improved forward
l i n e .
I.C.W.A. Hockey team had the "Hon-
our" of playing the I.C. Sports Club,
i n t h e i r 1st f i x t u r e of the sea.-on, at
Harlin ton on Sunday 23 Nocember. The
-porta Club fielded a far f i t t e r , faster
and stronger team producing some very
good hoc.:r/ players from the Rugby Club.
The game was fast ana clean, but I

could make only a .--light impression,
losing by 4 goals to 2. The entertain-
ment W
c
i
S continued afterwards in the bar
and on the dance floor. I.C.W.A. con-
gratulate the I.C. Sports Club for
their chivalry on and o f f the field.
SQUASH
I.G.'.S.C. has now seven squash
rlayers, only two these having any
previous experience on the courts.
The Men's Squash Club have given us a
few trainin" periods which ha-^e helped
considerably. In our first match we
were decisively beaten 5 - 0 by U.C.
With mors practice the match against
3.B.C. resulted in a J - 2 win. Against
Westfield our standard of play was oonsia-j
erahly improved, but we lost 3 - 2 . The
match against Cardiff was cancelled,
because the team never got there?
RUGBY
On Saturday 15 November, the 1st.IT
had a very successful "expedition" to
Somerset, when they lost to Bridgwater,
a first class West Country club, by
5 - 0 . Despite the slippery conditions
the team played up to the occasion. The
evenings rite:-tainraent lasted until 4 -
30 a.m. for 3
0
m
e
, and was particularly
enjoyed by the Hon(?) Fixture Secret-
ary.
The following Wednesday the team
met L.S.E. in the second round of the
U.L. Cup. This was an away game
played in good conditions, and resulted
in a decisive win for I.C. (12 pts. to
C). Milward and 'argretts Poth scored
tries, whilst Phillips licked two good
penalties. In the next round, on
February 11th, 1559, the club meet Wye
College.
Last Saturday the 1 st XV played a
strong Saracens ex-1 st team i n slippery
conditions, with the emphasis on forward
play; t i s game marJs the first occasion
upon which our pack has really been
mastered. At half time there was no
score, and the result s t i l l unpredictable
Early in the second half two good tries,
however, decided the game in Saracen's
favour. The final score at the end of
a very hard fought game was 6 - 0 .
Contrary to many opinions the fact, that
half of the team had been to the Il.C.S .
carnival, d i d not affect the result.
Tomorrow's games represent the
l a s t f o r the I.C. teams t h i s te m, and
with true Christmas " s r i r i t " we aim
to win them a l l , thus rounding off an
en.ioyable term's Rugby.
SOCCER

last six matches, drew 1-1 last Wed-
nesday against St. '

a
r
k and St. John's
College. The following Wednesday
the team played University College in
a League match, and, as anticipated, a
very hard game ensued. After leading
1-0 at half-time, a forceful header by
Young, the team played very well in
the second half and the final result
1-1 was a true reflection of the
match. The 1st XI record this sea-
son is:-

On Saturday Nov. 22, the 2nd
and 3rd XI's had very easy matches
against Brasenose College I and New
College I, winning 8-2 and 6-3 respect-
ively. The following Wednesday the two
teams, continuing their winning farm
beat Royal Dentals (3-1) and R.N.C. Gr-

respective divisions. Their performa-

The 7th XI is s t i l l continuing
to function and has played eight mat-
ches so far this season. Several of
their games have been cancelled due
solely to the unfit state of grounds
and a l l these by opponents.

CROSS COUNTRY
The Cross Country Club has continued
to be very successful during the past
fortnight. There have been no first
team matches i n this period, as six
I.C. men have been running in the two
U.L. teams, but I.C. II have defeated
Marjons, R.A.F. Cranwell, Repton School
and S.W. Essex Tech. College, while
I.C. I l l have beaten two teams, Bar-
clays Bank and Royal Vets II, losing
to Wimbledon A.G.
For the second team the Marjons
and S.W.E.T.C. races, both on away
courses, were easy victories. How-
ever, the race against Cranwell and
Repton, over the Cranwell course, was
very closely fought. A l l three teams
were very evenly matched, the final
result being:
1. I.C. II, 52 pts.
2. Repton, 54 pts.
3. Cranwell, 65 pts.
The individual winner, by 2 seconds,
was G.P. T i l l y , the I.C. Captain.
This is the f i r s t season in which
the club has had third team fixtures,
and i t is most encouraging to see that
I.C. I l l can win races.
F i n a l l y , i n a t r i a n g u l a r match at
Petersham, an I.C. "A" team scoring 62
pts. were beaten into t h i r d place by
Lloyds (49; and kings I ( 6 l ) . T i l l y
29 m 11 sec , Bernard 29 m 24 sec. _nu
Manson 30 m 05 sec. A l l recorded
personal best times f o r the course.
In the same race an I.C. t h i r d team
defeated Goldsmiths by 94 - 132.
FENCING
The term has • een > iu.it e promising.
Our membership has increased, considerably
and our fres.iers are showing a g r a t i f y -
ing keenness, due possibly to our nevi
Professor, A. Moldc/anyi. Our f i x t u r e s
have as usual suffered from cancellations,
only three of our scheduled f i x t u r e s
having taken pi:ce. The l a s t of these
was against L.SoiS. on Saturday 29th Inst,
the r e s u l t of vrhich war-a win f o r I.G.
