ALL NIGHT
CUBANTICS
W A V E S O F G A T E - C R A S H E R S R E P E L L E D
The Carnival year began last Friday
with R.C.S. setting the pace with their
"Cubantics". Those of us who went with
a pertain amount of trepidation, with
last year's dismal effort s t i l l in mind,
were pleasantly surprised. Here was
one of the better carnivals of reoent
years.
Its advent was viewed with some
concern by the organisers, as i t coin-
cided with the Annual Dinnei of the
Chemical Engineering Society - a body
some-what notorious for their boisterous
post-bar behaviour. Accordingly, fair-
ly elaborate precautions were taken to
prevent them, and other gate-crashers
from entering.
A l l revellers' hands were given a
carnival stamp on the production of a
ticket - unfortunately the tickets were
not collected, and a few 'crashers',
obtaining a ticket from a genuine aold-
er, managed to get stamped. However, I
the main body who tried to enter by
brute force were successfully repelled j
by a collection of the best R.C.S. brawn |
and two huge uniformed "Chuckers-out"
The subdued group of would-be
'crashers' remained for some time hes- ]
itantly eyeing the opposition. At
square meal time they were politely ask-
ed to leave and/or forcibly ejected.
Then started a remarkable seiies j
of attacks and counter-attacks whioh
continued until cabaret time at 1 a.m.
A besotted form of strategy was employ-
ed by the determined Chemicals, who
kept the stalwart doormen occupied while
an inside accomplice was letting otherd
in through the Refectory windows. This
continued ad infinitum with a steady
flow of the same people being ejected
through the door. (I saw one thrown out
five times!)
Then trouble came from a different !
quarter - about ten couples arrived from
outside with the same intention, but (
were quickly escorted off the premises. >
Back on the home front the marauders
had switched to another entry point, by
procuring ladders and entering through j
the gymnasium - and the steady flow of
ejected Quildsmen continued.....
By this time i t had become a point
of honour far them to 'crash' into the
Carnival - and by cabaret time they were j
as determined as ever, bruised and con-
siderably more sober I trust that j
they enjoyed the cabaret !
A lot of hard work had obviously
gone into the cabaret; they were indeed
fortunate in having such a lively comp-
ere as Malcolm Green. That i t was wr-
itten by Mr Leston was only too obvious
- i t was a pity that much of the humour
was so coarse, and in some casern blatan-
tly 30. Admittedly this is the easy
way to get laugh3, but surely i t is not
necessary to stoop that low to humour
supposedly educated people?
The 'flats' were designed by Bruce
Cozens on the abstract theme - i t i s
indeed good to see a higher standard of
flat design evolving. Some of the
best of reoent years were those of Vere
Atkinson. Two photographs of his ies-
ign for "Night-time with Neptune' -1956.
appear In the present issue.

FELIX celebrated hi3 Ninth Birthday
by holding his annual Dance on Novem-
ber 22nd. He installed this year a
night-club upstairs which was def-
initely the greatest success of the
evening - the smoke, the flicxering
candles and the exquisite mood nmsio
merging into an intimate presence.
In a neighbouring alcove, couples
swayed gently to the music, disengaging
only when cur candid photographer app-
eared. Even the advent of our Sport's
Editor, riding a bicycle in tropical
kit, fail3d tc 4
nter-st tha snoochlni;
masses. In true 'dive' style, the lights
were flashed on to terminate the even-
ings official entertainment, prcvo!cing
a protesting ohorus of startled noises
from embarra'sed parties, although some
of them didn't even notice
Downstairs, under the benevolent
guidance of Charlie Parley, the orthuiox
dance proceeded. A l i t t l e light relief
was provided in the second half by the
Editor, who demonstrated his 'skill' with
the Hulahoop to an enthralled (!) aud-
ience before i s i t i n g a young lady tc
follow his ex The other victims
of a spot-da ..ere required to eat ban-
ana in the frenoh style, which they did
willingly - although making raad-pass-
ionate love with a mouthful of banana
would not appeal to everyone!

"Theta", which got loose on Morphy
Day, is once again in the hands of i t s
keepers, R.C.S. were informed that
i t was to be used by Guilds for exper-
imental work connected with the Round
Pond i n Kensington Gardens.
On arrival, they saw i t s top prot-
ruding above the surface, periscope wise,
in the middle. A gallant P.G., braving
the Artie waters, waded, chest deep and
released Theta from i t s icy seclusion.
The previous night, three furtive
Guildsmen had crept to the pond with
their booty, when they were challenged
by a police dog and handler. The other
unfortunate was unluckier - being chased
up a tree by a ferooious Boxer. Next
morning the three nootabmulists returned
to complete "Operation Theta".
'R.C.S. CUBANTICS'
These words,of sombre colour, I
descried
Writ on the lintel of a gateway;
"Sir,
This sentence is right hard for mej
I cried.
And like a man of quick discernment:
Here lay down a l l thy distrust
Lay down a l l thy distrust," said he,
"reject
Dead from within thee every ooward
fear;
We've reached the place I told thee
to expect,
Where thou shouldst see .the
Where thou shouldst see the miserable
race,
Those who have lost the good, of
intellect."
He laid nis hand on mine, and with a
face
So joyous that i t comforted my
quailingj
Into the hidden things he led my ways,
ways
Here sighing, and here crying, and
loud railing
Smote on the starless air, with
lamentation,
So that at first T wept to hear such
wailing.
Tongues mixed and mingled, horrible
execration,
Shrill shrieks, hoarse groans, fierce
yell3 and hideous blether
And clapping of hands thereto, without
cessation
Mads tumult through the timeless night,
that hither
And thither drives in dizzying circles
sped,
As whirlwind whips the spinning sands
together.
Wherat, with horror flapping round
my head:
"Master, >hai's this I hear? Who can
they be,
These people so distraught with grief?"
I said.
And he replied:"The dismal company of
wretched spirits
ire watching the R.C.S. Carnival
Cabaret.*
