I.C. INDECISION
Dear Sir,
Does an attitude of indecision
prevail-at I.C,? Is i t considered rea-
sonable that people may commit them-
selves to any particular College act-
ivity and then reserve the right to
withdraw at a moments notice? Judging
from recent Mountaineering Club and
Y.H.A. Meets, and by glancing down, for
example, the Athletics team l i s t s , the
answer would seem to be yes!
It must be pointed out to these
somewhat thoughtless people that such
last minute indecisions not only cause
club organisers endless trouble, but
also show a complete lack of respon-
s i b i l i t y on the offenders part.
Yours faithfully,
W.A.T. White (Y.H.A.) P. Smith (M.C.)
D.A. Faulkner (Soccer)K.W. Ludlam (A.C.)

CARDSHARPERS
Dear Sir,
The Upper Lounge i n the Union Build-
ing-has been commandeered by a small
group of cardsharpers who unfortunat-
ely find i t necessary to accompany this
amusement by high spirits and very loud
voioes. If the lounge was intended for
such purposes I apologise to these gent-
lemen. If not, i s there any constit-
utional means by whioh reasonable quiet-
ness could be enforced, as such prattle
must drive many people from this very
comfortable room!
Yours
J. Latham.

Hardbitten readers of this journal
wij.1 remember Hubert Edwin Smith, a
browhbagger who reformed late in his
College career and was eventually
"profiled" in Felix No, 98 This
Christmas sees the departure from our
midst of Hubert's elder brother B.T.L.
Smith - "Dregs" as he i s known to us
a l l .
"Dregs" came to I.C. last year
rather late in life (but very young in
spirit) to do research i n a specialised
branch of biophysical metallurgy i n
which he is reputed to be a World
Authority. This particular topic is the
study of the influence of skin thick-
ness and load distribution factor on
metal fatigue in the hobnails of the
boots worn by lame centir edes. "Dregs"
is reluctant to say whether the reason
for his departure i s the completion of
the research or a cessation of his Air
Ministry grant. Whatever the reason,
he will leave a large gap in our
society.
There are those endearing "Dregs"
mannerisms which have made their* mark
on certain sections of the Union: a
modest and unassuming manner, unim-
peachable gentility towards ladies, and
a down-to-earth manner of speech.
pDregs" has never been known to call
a spade a "spade"). These, combined
with a Mr. Punch - like profile and
vnique physique made him a certain
choice for President of R.C.S. had he
been able to stay with us longer.
A tribute such as this must not
f a i l to make reference to the supreme
ability of B.T.L. Smith as a musician
of the highest rank. He has his favour-
ite trumpet which i s seldom idle - to
the great entertainment of those who
would wish to be thought of as his
â€¢friends. Mr. Editor of Felix must be
wondering how he will be able to f i l l
his columns after Christmas.

Society,
W.C.
Dec. 7th.
Dear Sir,
My attention has been drawn to the
fact that i t i s planned to include in
the new I.C. Union building a room of
considerable dimensions whose sole pur-
pose i s the sale of intoxication liqu-
ors, and the singing of songs of a nat-
ure such that most members of the
College are rightly shocked by the low
moral standards displayed by the drunken
participants.
It i s well known that the incidence
of drunkenness in the younger generation
is increasing, and the corresponding
decline in moral standards is, I am
sure, due to the disgusting habit of
some students (fortunately few) drinking
themselves insensible on every possible
occasion.
Is i t not too late to have the plans
altered and convert this room to some
more useful purpose such as for communal-
hymn singing, or i f this i s impossible
to limit the liquids sold to those of
beneficial nature such as milk and
orange juice.
Yours etc.,
A. Charles
NELSON'S C O L U M N
To begin on a serious note, Nelson,
on behalf of a l l our readers, extends
his best wishes f o r a speedy recovery
to Peter Parsons (Zoology 3} I.C. i s not
the same without "Slasher".
Carnival time i s here again and as
usual, I.C. have r i s e n t o the occasion
and the female population has correspond-
i n g l y increased several hundred per cent
i n fact there appears t o be more women
than men i n residenoe:
Post-Carnival couples, naturallv
a l i t t l e below par, emerging from the
hostel oh that-morning-after-the-night
before, were somewhat perturbed to see
a horse prancing around the quad.
However, oloser inspection and the ap-
pearance of a bottle of brown ale from
its stomach, revealed that i t was human
after a l l . Beneath this equine guise
were two offshoots of the Mountaineer-
ing Club: Dick Wright (bearded front
legs) and Pete Smith (bearded back legs)
As they cantered precariously up the
Hostel steps they neighed something
about a Riding Club Hop.
Society's darling, debonair Mike
Newson, was caught by a DAILY TELEGRAPH
photographer doing an eightsome r e e l
with the Queen Mother a t the U.L.U.
President's Ball recently. With char-
acteristic modesty he was facing away
from the camera at the time. We gat-
her that i t was an enjoyable affair
from what he hiccoughed later at the
Carnival, in between clarinet solos
from a horizontal position on the floor.
Rumours, circulated by Mr. Leston,
well-known musician, composer, author,
bug-catch-er andgenius (as he modestly
will admit)that this issue was to be a
Denis Leston Farewell Edition, are en-
tirely without foundation.
Another rumour that has been spread-
ing recently i s that I.C. has a President
and that he may appear i n public soon.
T h i s is no cause tc panic however, f o r
rumours, like dartbtjards, have a way of
disappearing into t h i n a i r .
Before you JJ.1 3 e t t l e down t o the
serious business of celebrating, here i s
a l e t t e r from a previous F e l i x (December
1956) which might i n t e r e s t you.
The most signigicant thing there,
i t seems t o me, i s the W.C.
We feel that we should apologise
for any inconsistansies i n this issue.
For, with a make-up immediately after
the carnival, we did not get-*e-bed get
much sleep that weekend.
