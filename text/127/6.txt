We are happy to announce that we
are able to s e l l this special 12-page
Christmas issue for FOURFENCE only.
It was our intention to raise the price
to sixpence, to cover the increased
printing costs, but having made a slight
profit over the past term, we are able
to "plough back the profits into the
business" and give YOU the benefit.

LIMERICK COMPETITION
That "Clever young student from Bow"
promoted considerable activity among
our limerick writers. As expected the
unprintable section attracted the great-
est attention, and i t must be added that,
in general, the entries were of a surp-
risingly high literary standard.
By far the best came from J.R.
Loome (Oil Tech.), who demonstrated the
effectiveness of applied hydraulics.
Due to the excellence of his limerick*
we have decided to double his prize -
so he now wins TWO ripe bananas. We
would ask him to collect them as soon
as possible, or else they will be shot.
The printable section was less pop-
ular and obviously no-one had really
tried over-hard. There was a_little
originality in some of tne entries, but
the majority were of l i t t l e merit. A
few of the better ones appear below:-
P.M. Watkiss.. had morals exceedingly
low,
He picked up a tart,
In Hyde Park, for a lark,
And the rest of the story
you know.
Fred Peacock.. explaining his fine heal-
thy glow,
Said'I feel much brighter,
My inside is whiter
With two doses a day of
0M0.'
.V. .N
.\ PSfF... tried to f l y to the moon
on a hoe,
But a technical blunder
Split our hero asunder,
Now he can't even reach
bottom 'doh'.
J.R. Loome ... learnt his syllabus a l l
at one go,
But when asked to repeat
This incredible feat,
He burst into tears and
cried "No."
Copies will be sent in plain s.a.t. on
request. (Student under 16 and members

LIKELY STORIES N c 4
by Scraper
There once was an engineering cat
called Antonio de Luxe. His father
•oanufactured mousetraps, as had his
father before him. so he obviously was
destined for the Empirical College.
Here he graduated and began writing a
thesis with particular reference to
nousetraps.
As a result of his researches he
patented a trap which caught more mice
not only more quickly but also in less
time than any other. This trap was
naturally a great success, but sales
shortly began to f a l l off owing to the
catastrophis decrease in the mioe pop-
ulation, l.'ore mice were urgently
needed and i t was to this problem that
young Antonio presently devoted him-
self. "Now" he reasoned, "no more mice
are to be found on the face of the Earth.
Therefore,"he concluded"triumphantly " i t
will be necessary to d r i l l for them."
So Antonio consulted the Geology
Department and on their advice sought
out the likliest location. Then he
set up his gear and commenced operations.
He was just getting down to 13,000 f t . ,
when suddenly there shot up into the a
air a vast gusher of ferocious super-
mice, each one armed with a hacksaw and
carrying a pair of wire cutters. Quick
as a flash Antonio leapt into his space-
ship and hurtled off to Kars to start a
new division of I.C.I.
