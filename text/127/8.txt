(FROM THE FELIX OF OCTOBER 29 1978)
ISLAND SITE ALMOST READY
Last Thursday the Director-Gen-
eral of the Imperial Technical College,
in the University of Kensington, spoke
to an invited audience of Professors i n
the Techtopian Hall. Owing to the pres-
ence of journalists being forbidden by
the Director of College Security, the
only report available of the D-G1
s add-
ress is that issued by the Chancellor
of Publications.
"During the last Technological Year
the Board of Inspectors has permitted
lJOO technocrats to be awarded Diplomas
and Associate3hips in recognition of
their devotion to the doctrines of our
eminent establishment. Former Dip-
lomates now hold a large percentage of
the Chairmen's seats of our public org-
anisations. The industrial pre-emin-
ence of our country is due, in no small
measure, to their inspired leadership.
"The rebuilding of our main site,
begun many years ago, proceeds apace;
final landscaping with the siting of
statuary, symbolic of our heritage,
should be complete next summer. It
is, however, with no small measure of
regret, that our final r e l i c of last
oentury's Empire had to be demolished
in view of i t s Pisa-like tendencies.
Colcutt's Campanile, a symbol of Vict-
orian morals, proved to be of insuff-
icient strength tp support our atomic
powered stereo-colourvision station
which has for many years been the major
disseminator of technicoprogaganda.
"Our thanks are due to the United
Grand Lodge of Space-Travelling Profe-
ssors, for their munificent benefaction
of £500,000 and vast quantities of
moonshine. This will be a spur for our
charge in the investigation of the primeval
occupations of the inhabitants of outer
space.
"Our ever-growing resident pop-
ulation, an increase of sixteen over
the last week, has called for an expan-
sion of our existential rooms. To meet
this contingency, only married couples
are permitted to rent a room for their
own exclusive use, a l l other students
will be required to live a Cox and Box
l i f e . For this purpose Professorial
declamations will be issued in duplicate
at twelve hour intervals. A l l stud-
ents will be required to attend these
instructions, under the pain of elim-
ination, and deportation to the Farm,
at Silwood Park. In passing, I should
mention that over the last f i f t e e n
years three wardens have seen f i t to
commit suicide from the balconies of
thier tenth story penthouse f l a t s .
Little truth i s attached to the
rumours that their minds were
deranged by a former Domestic Charge
d'Affairs, but in view of the Cor-
oner's remarks, this post has now been
abolished.
"On excursions through our newly
created heritage avoiding whenever
possible the manumated gardeners, the
feeling of over-powering monumentality.
is ever-pre3ent. Vast slaps of concrete,
faced with -.^riegated slate, and fast
darkening Portland stone, soar up into
the azure skies. The seried files of
glass, mirror the suns rays into the
darkest recesses of the neighbouring
courtyards.
"Turning over now to student affairs,
the Union, with i t s compulsory membership
moves from strength to strength. As a
result of their ever increasing numbers,
further committees have been created,
in order to control the committees
already existing. Overall control i s ,
however, vested i n the small central
praesidium which meats regularly in the
Presidents offices. Owing to the
pressure of compulsory 3tudy the time
available for extra-technical interests
has been unavoidably reduced.
"In conclusion, Professors, I give
you the charge; press on with your
researches, i n s t i l into your students
the necessity for hard work, give to
the world the benefit of your s k i l l . "

John Taylor writes:
The Director-General' s address
makes interesting reading. The dev-
elopment of College follows the well
worn paths of Administrative monoliths.
As a student diring the early days of
the rebulding scheme i t was with inter-
est that I read of i t s impending com-
pletion. During the time that I was
a member of the FELIX board, I was a
ceaseless critic of the follies of
College Organisation. I hope that many
of my contemporaries will not feel too
deeply the subsequent development of I.C.
as a Technical College.
