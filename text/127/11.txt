SWIMMING
The water polo team i3 now begin-
ning to play aa a team, and have
scored several hard earned victories.
The successful run started when Regent
St. Poly were-defeated at the Poly
bath, by 7 goals to 6. Although
seemingly a close result I.C. were
never behind, Poly scoring three late
goals. Scorers:- Jones 4, Basham 2,
Larsen 1. The next evening Q.M.C.
were our guests, whom we well beat by
4 - 2 i n a hard fought game.
Scorers:- .Jones 3, Larsen 1. The
College next defeated an Avondale II
team by 4 - 3 after a very hard, fast
match. Scorers:- Basham 2, Jones 1,
Mears 1. A feature of these games
has been the impressed showing of Janes,
who i s now the clubs leading goal-
scorer.
The second team broke their loos-
ing sequence when they defeated Chelsea
Poly by 4-2, and in so doing, gave the
best exhibition of polo seen at the
College this term. Scorers:- Church,
Connor, Wilson, Hills. The previous
evening they had put up a poor show
against N.E.C., a much stronger team
than Chelsea, loosing 8-1.
The swimming section have been
continuing their winning-ways. The
first team, although weakened, were
Just too strong for Q.M.C. winning by
the narrow margin of 2 pts. The
second team visited Goldsmiths and
showed the power of the College reserve
strength, by winning every event, rom-
ping home by 37 pts to 21 pts.
SA/L/NG
A student who spends thre- o f the
"best years of h i s ( o r her) l i f e at Imp-
e r i a l College and who does not take f u l l
advantage o f the opportunities offered
by the Union has missed the chance o f
a l i f e t i m e . Everybody i n the College,
f o r example, i s able to t r y h i s hand
at a new sport, perhaps one which he
has never before considered. For most
people, s a i l i n g i s just such a sport.
The College club s a i l s five racing
dinghies of the f i r e f l y class on the
Welsh Har at Wembley,, generally recog-
nised as the, largest and best s t r e t c h
of s a i l i n g water i n the London area.
Races are held e^cli week-end and within
a few months most .eople can learn t o
handle a boar oo:npeteiitiy enough to
take part.
The club hopes to exten!

ATHLETICS
Sundry members of the club were
prised from their cocoons to compete in
a relay meeting against L . 3 . 3 . , U.C.,
King's and a visiting German team
Mannheim. Owing to bad traffic con-
ditions the tourists arrived an hour and
a half late when many runners had gone
home, but scratch teams were entered
with varied results a l l round, glow-
worms being used instead of batons.
A free tea afterwards compensated some-
what for the disappointing results.
FELIX
HOCKEY
The Hockey Club has continued to
maintain a high level of "winning -
efficiency", and, considering a l l four
teams, the results now show that 20 of
of the 32 games .;ave been won and five
drawn.
The greatest share of success must
go to the 1st XI, who have now won 10
of their 14 games, drawn 3a
nd only
lost one. The cup team received a great
boost by beating Battersea in the first
round of the U.L. Cup. Last years
winners, were beaten 2 - 1 in one of the
most exciting games of the season. I f
the team can keep up this standard of
plaj' for the rest of the competition,
then the cup should be claimed by I.C.
The 2nd XI i s producing equally
good results despite fairly constant
changes. The general standard of play
in this team has improved greatly this
term and members of the 1 st XI are
beginning to realize that places can
only be kept by consistent play and
general keenness.
The 4th XI in i t s first season is
showing remarkable keenness, and by
winning 4 °f i t s first b games has
proved that the mate -ial of a good
team is there. The recent provision
of I.C. shirts has done much to
improve the prestige of the team •
W
e are proud to relate that Nigel
Holmes has recently been appointed vice-
captain of U.L. 1st XI team. Stanton
and Mantel continue to rush about on
the wings and Dave Rees (TT
on. Sec. I.C.
H.C.) has established himself in the
half back line.
BASKET BALL
The I.C. 1 st team in its 4th match
played against Woolwich Poly, the
league's most prominent team. The team
was by no means outclassed, but at half
time were 12 points down. The second
half produced two quick baskets for I.C.,
but tiiis, however, did not result in
victory; Woolwich 56 ots. - I.C. 48
Pts.
Thirsting for revenge we regarded
University College as mere "Lambs to
the Slaughter", despite the presence of
a Unive sity player in their team.
Par superior in every aspect of the game
I.C. were never troubled, and finally
won by 44 pts - 22 pts.
Unfortunate!-' for N.E.C., cur next
opponents, I.C. 1st t~am hit too form.
The team maintained an unrelenting
ores ure vjal at half time led by ^4 - 9.
In the second half the same high stand-
ard of play was maintained; resulting
in a final score of 109 - 21. (which
constitutes a league record). The
magnificent performance of player/coach,
tike Barron, must not go unheralded.
Despite his lack of inches he managed
to score 56 points.
The next match was against Chelsea,
gave I.C. l i t t l e trouble, with I.C.
dictating the pace. The team played
like demons, but missed the jackpot
by 9pts., beating Chelsea by 91 - 22.
For the record P W L P.P. P,A.

In view of the amount of white-

taken to the Dennis works at Guildt.
ford to check on the state of the bear-
ings.
She went there on Friday evening
and work began on Saturday morning.
She was placed on a ramp and the sump
and various odds and ends were removed.
The chairman now personally re-
oommends XXL hair cream.
The bearings were found to be in
relatively good condition, with a reas-
onable amount of metal left in the shells.
Provided that revs are kept down, Jez
should be good for. several years more.
A defective pipe in the o i l 'system' was
replaced, with the result that we now
have some o i l pressure, which is prob-
ably a good thing.
Reassembly began on Saturday after-
noon and was finished on Sunday morninng.
She arrived back at R.C.S. a f t e r a very-

SQUASH CLUB
With only the "sport" fixture
against U.L. Women to be played, the
lst team has carried its, unbe ten
reco d almost to Christmas. Con-
stant practice and at least t-vo matches

ed match fitness and this i s reflected
in the results. During the past two

, St. Edmund Hall, O.sford,
and Kings were a l l beaten by 5-0 and

of examinations, to maintain this
record throughout the season.
