desk staff with a Duty Manager providing support).
Experience:
You should have some experience in the use of one, or more, of
PCs, UNIX or Macs and be able to communicate effectively with
people. We do not expect you to be an computer expert (but if
you are, then that too is not a problem). However you should
have a reasonable User type experience in one or more of the
areas mentioned and be willing to learn. Enthusiasm and
willingness are just as important as technical knowledge when
you start.
Professionalism:
Since we are the front-line for the Centre, we consider it
important that clients are treated in the best possible way.
Politeness and willingness to do the best for the client is
important, almost more important than computer knowledge.
