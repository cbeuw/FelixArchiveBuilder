FELIX FRIDAY 25TH OCTOBER FEATURE 7
Dunblane : A balanced response?
The Government has taken this
action in response to the shootings at
Dunblane. This incident was a
national tragedy, something nobody
wants to see repeated. However, it
seems unreasonable to deprive thou-
sands of responsible people of their
chosen sport unless the proposed
changes significantly reduce the
chances of such an event happening
again.
Over one million people shoot in
the UK. They come from all walks
of life. It is one of the few sports
which allows men and
women of all ages, able-
bodied and disabled, to
compete on an entirely
equal basis.
Shooters are aware that
firearms are potentially dan-
gerous. For this reason the
sport is heavily regulated by
both the present gun laws,
amongst the strictest in the
world, and by shooters
themselves in the form of
the regulations laid down by
the sport's governing bod-
ies.
The phrase "guns don't
kill people, people kill peo-
ple" has become a cliche,
and been dismissed as such
by the press. It is true
nonetheless. The most
effective way to ensure
safety is not to restrict the
guns in use by calibre or
magazine capacity, but to
control which people have
access to them. This task is
carried out by the police,
who control the issuing of
licenses, in cooperation
with the shooters them-
selves. Gun clubs have strict
rules governing who they will admit,
and will not hesitate to ban anyone
considered unfit. All applicants for
firearms certificates are required by
law to have completed at least six
months as probationary members of
Home Office approved clubs, and so
these rules help the police in decid-
ing whether to grant such a certifi-
cate.
After the tragedy of Dunblane, the
government ordered an independent
enquiry into gun legislation led by
the eminent Scottish judge Lord
Cullen. He conducted a thorough
investigation and made a number of
considered proposals for tightening
the law in order to ensure that the
Few people can be unaware that the Government has introduced a bill severe-
ly restricting the use of firearms in the sport of target shooting. Felix invited
the Imperial College Rifle and Pistol Club to react to the Bill.
the conclusions of the enquiry that
they had ordered. Instead they disre-
garded the report's recommendations
and announced the bans listed above
as well as additional restrictions on
the owning and keeping of firearms.
likes of Thomas Hamilton would be
denied access to firearms.
One would have thought that the
government might pay attention to
P R O P O S E D C H A N G E S
ยง A ban on all handguns larger than the smallbore calibre of
0.22"
ยง A ban on all self loading handguns
The bans were promptly described as
Draconian by Lord Cullen.
Some might argue that since the
majority of people in this country
seemed to be in favour of the bans,
the government were right to capitu-
late to public pressure. I disagree.
The majority of the public, who have
had no direct personal experience of
the sport, have based their views on
reports in the popular press, which
have mostly been biased and some-
times inaccurate. Most people have
been led to believe that a ban will
greatly improve public safety,
whereas afirearmsexpert who gave
evidence to the Cullen enquiry has
stated that it will not. In fact, the cur-
rent legislation should
have prevented Thomas
Hamilton from obtaining a
firearms certificate as the
officer who interviewed
him recommended against
the issue of a license, but
was overruled by a senior
officer. This would seem
to be a deficiency in the
implementation of the law
by the local police, rather
than in the law itself.
The high profile of the
tragedies at Hungerford
and Dunblane has also
meant that the number of
illegally held weapons has
been forgotten. At a recent
meeting of senior Police
officers, the chairman
accepted as accurate an
estimate that 96% of
firearms used in crime had
never been registered. In
other words, they had
never been legally owned
by a dealer or private
owner.
We should not forget
what happened at
Dunblane, and it would be
a second tragedy if Lord
Cullen's recommendations for pre-
venting its repetition were not acted
on. What shooters fear is that legisla-
tion will be passed which goes
beyond this and bans the ownership
of handguns in order to punish all
those involved in the sport for
Thomas Hamilton's actions. We are
in danger of losing this most chal-
lenging and enjoyable sport forever
without the justification of improv-
ing public safety.
