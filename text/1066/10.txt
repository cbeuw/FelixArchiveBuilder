S T U D E N T HARDSHIP V S
ANIMALS
Something that I meant to point out
last week, but never got around to, is
the surprising lack of response to the
first issue's feature on student fund-
ing compared to that to Jon Trout's
article on animals.
A sense of priorities that places the
welfare of 'small furry things' above
that of humans (however selfish they
may be) is perverse. The two should-
n't be judged with the same values,
as the favour is clearly not recipro-
cated.
So where were the letters lament-
ing the passing of students' meagre
maintainance grants into history? It
might seem selfish to compare the
two, but it is peculier that students
are prepared to stand up for admit-
tedly voice-less animals yet are not
prepared to even comment on events
that they will feel the effects of far
more keenly.
SHEDDING LIGHT O N THE
GREY A R E A S
The letter entitled "Us and Them?"
on the opposite page raises a few
interesting points. The correspondent
has noticed the tendency of some
College staff to huddle in a 'grey
area' of departments' smoking poli-
cies. The department mentioned here
is, I believe, Physics, one of the last
departments to ban smoking in pub-
lic areas (Felixes passim), and one
which tried to accomodate both
smokers and non-smokers for many
years.
The intention behind bans such as
these was obsentially for health and
appearance sakes, both laudable rea-
sons. However, it does require even-
handed implementation and, per-
haps, education, for staff and stu-
dents alike. For students to see staff
breaking rules like these will not
encourage them to keep to rules in
other areas, such as the new policies
on rollerblading on campus. So
maybe a closer eye needs paying to
the greyer areas of departments and
their policies to ensure that people do
not feel that there is one rule for
some and another rule for others.
A B U N G E D U P NOSE...
Like many others, I have succumbed
already this term to a heavy dose of
what is colloquially known as "fresh-
ers' 'flu". I would like to thank
whichever fresher it was who
swanned through the office and left
some of their germs floating around
for me to breathe in.
It was, as sure many of you will
readily sympathise, a somewhat
deabilitating experience and brought
with it its own share of sleepless
nights, snuffly noses and 'out-of-
body' feelings. I mention this last
one in particular (though perhaps it is
something peculier to me), as there is
nothing quite like staring at a page of
text and suddenly feeling like you are
falling through it in a "it's full of
stars" manner. If it wasn't for the fact
that the 'flu also engenders an inabil-
ity to concentrate and a neccessity to
constantly down 'Tunes', I might not
mind the annual depletion of my han-
kerchief reserves.
BOLD A N D CHEEKY
PEOPLE NEEDED
One last thing. Felix could really
do with some dedicated photogra-
phers for news, features and photo-
stories. So if you have a wish to take
pictures using some good 'ole fash-
ioned optics, then come along to the
Felix office in Beit Quad at 6.00pm
on Mondays.
