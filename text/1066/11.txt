LETTERS TO FELIX
edited this week by David Roberts
Deterrence and
Determination
Dear Felix,
It is with a wry smile and ironic
amusement that I read last weeks
articles on Dangerous Cyclists and
Bike Coding having had my D-
locked bicycle stolen on the
Thursday preceding. I write not so
much as to correct your quality pub-
lication but your misguided security
informant. It may be that the RSM
walkway is covered by four separate
security cameras. But to my unfortu-
nate experience I have discovered
that the cameras are merely a device
installed ofpsychological expedience
for the benefit of all (the student,
security and the establishment) con-
cerned with the possible exception of
the criminals involved.
The truth of the matter is that
whilst the security reception may be
the epitome of modern CCTV tech-
nology the information relayed by
the cameras occupies only a fraction
of the television screen. As for the
attention paid to it in a security recep-
tion that on two occasions reminded
me of lunch time at McDonald's
Well, one wonders whether
increasingly scarce resources may be
better directed toward some other
means of crime prevention? Or
would it be less pretentious to say
crime deterrence? Without detracting
from the cumulative advantages of a
secure lock and bike coding, insur-
ance it seems is the only answer, wis-
dom indeed for all to contemplate
than to learn of bitter, and oh yes I
am, experience.
Yours as Ever,
Humbaba
(a pen name under which I'd rather
have the article published under than
receive hate mail, many thanks)
Dear Felix,
With respect to the "News in Brief
item ("Bike Coding") that the "safest
place for bikes is on the RSM walk-
way". Safest for whom? Easiest, and
cheapest, for College Security cer-
tainly, but is this prompted as much
by laziness as by concerns for the
security and safety of the general col-
lege population?
Who thought that centralisation,
particularly in that area, was a good
idea? It certainly won't have been a
cyclist. Are the College authorities
going to pay for the damage caused
by leaving bikes out in all weathers?
Are students in Chemistry,
Computing or Physics really going to
want to traipse half way across the
campus?
The transport situation in London
is appaling. Car use is ridiculously
high, public transport woefully
under-funded and under-used.
College should be encouraging bike
use, not making it dramatically hard.
Quite rightly the local police are
clamping down on illegal pavement
cycling, and not before time, but is it
any wonder that a growing propor-
tion of cyclists are turning to this
method? London's roads are packed
with irate motorists casting envious
glances at the urban cyclist who is fit-
ter, happier and quicker than any dri-
ver, pedestrian or bus-user. Road
rage is not a headline or a buzz-
phrase, it is a daily occurrence and a
real menace to the safety of cyclists.
The quicker the police crack down on
that, with the appropriate backing by
the law courts who seem to value the
life of a cyclist very lightly, the better
the life of everyone.
Attack the cause, not the symptom
- the future transport of London
might not be the bike, but it certainly
is not the car.

Caldwell: The saga
continues
Dear Mr Feakes
I am writing in response to Mr
Caldwell's reply to Mr Baker's arti-
cle two weeks ago, which stated that
the College is suffering from a lack
of funding due to the Government
cutbacks. I would like to point out
some key facts arising from the
response which came on the same
day that the new book shop tender
was announced in Felix 1065.
The ICU Bookstore currently is a
source of income for Imperial
College Union, as it is a Union retail
facility, similar to Da Vinci's and the
Union Bar. This income can, and is,
used to fund improvements in student
facilities and activities. One obvious
example of this is the construction of
dBs, now a venue of exceptional
quality, funded solely through the
operating surplus of the Union's
retail outlets.
The question that should now be
asked is thus; how can College justi-
fy the tendering of the ICU
Bookstore when an outside retailer
would not retain retail income on the
campus, for the benefit of the College
community at large? Surely this will
lead to a reduction of the Union's
income, which will result in less
funds for student activities and the
continuing development of Union
facilities. How will this shortfall be
covered? I, for one, certainly do not
wish to see any student services com-
promised.
The tender is seen by myself and
numerous others as a particularly
unsavoury idea. The student body
would rather see its money being
recycled to the Union than go to an
external company's profits and
shareholders' dividend payments.
Yours,
Caroline J. Deetjen.
Dear Editor,
May I make a small correction to
your news item (18 Oct. p.4) about
the tenders for the Bookshop?
It was never proposed that I should
appoint a student to the panel which
will consider the tenders. What has
happened is that I conferred with the
ICU President about how best to rep-
resent the student interest, remember-
ing that as one of the tenderers (we
assume) the Union could not proper-
ly have a member or officer on the
panel. The President proposed, and I
was delighted to agree, that Professor
Bob Schroter should be a member of
the panel. Your readers can reason-
ably assume that the other members
will remember that the new book-
shop will exist primarily to meet the
needs of students.
Yours sincerely,
Alan Swanson
Us and Them?
Since I returned for my second year,
I have noticed the storekeeper smok-
ing in the store, and when I go to my
lecture theatres 2 and 3,1 notice tech-
nicians smoking in the stairway, toi-
lets and workshop.
Is there a rule for us on no smok-
ing, and one for them for smoking in
their areas?
H.O.D. policy is NO smoking - or
is it no-one checking? Policy for us,
policy for them?
Second year student, standing out-
side smoking.

Dear Editor
I would like to draw to your attention
what final year students have to deal
with in looking for a job. IC may
pride itself on having a 'Careers
Office' to assist us in looking for a
job, and College may enjoy looking
at the Times League Table of col-
lege's graduate jobs, but it seems as
if students do all the job searching
themselves.
Firstly the Careers Office is just
not big enough to deal with the num-
ber of people who enter their third
floor office. They have one desk, one
person to deal with the enquiries of a
few thousand final year students -
does that make sense ?
Then there is their programme of
lectures and workshops. What hap-
pens if you are not able to go at the
specific times that they get people in
to talk about filling in application
forms and dealing with interviews ?
They have an impressive list of
speakers from top quality companies,
but if you study languages over lunch
time you cannot benefit.
Their workshops are even more
difficult to get into, at least you can
pack people into lecture theatres,
with courses being fully booked for
weeks in advance. One session of
courses gets fully booked, and they
won't take bookings for the next lot -
you can't win!
If college is serious about helping
students in not only gaining qualifi-
cations, but also graduate jobs, then
they should provide decent facilities
and lectures and courses that we can
actually benefit from.
