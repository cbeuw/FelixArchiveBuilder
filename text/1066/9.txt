"The Mind Of Man"
'What is Man that thou art mindful of him?'
What are his deeds but reeds blowing in the wind?
To fully understand the species of Man,
You must be mindful of him, for Man is Mind;
A dual edged sword that is both curse and gift.
The Mind - the greatest bane of Man?
The mind that guides the hand;
The hand that wields the sword, the gun,
The hand the mutilates and destroys.
The mind that controls the tongue;
The tongue that bruises the soul, the heart,
The tongue that pronounces death and doom.
That mind that thinks, creates, imagines;
That spends it's time devising new ways to maim,
To torture, to better cull Man.
The Mind - the greatest blessing of Man?
The mind that guides the hand;
The hand that harvests a land of crops,
The hand that tends the sick and heals the injured.
The mind that guides the tongue;
The tongue that comforts and puts away fear,
That tongue that praises and exalts another.
The mind that designs and builds;
That thinks of ways to better Man,
To solve his problems, assauge his doubts.
Bane or Blessing - the Mind is Man.
