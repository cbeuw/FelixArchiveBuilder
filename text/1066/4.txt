The case ofthe 'superfluous insurance'
Are Imperial College students being conned into paying for insurance they don't need? Simon
Wistow dons trench coat and fedora and steps out to investigate ...
As anyone who has tried to join a
sports club this year will have found
out, the College appears to have insti-
tuted a supplementary insurance pol-
icy in the form of Activities Cards,
bought at the bargain price of one and
a half pounds sterling.
For this pint-purchasing sum of
money you become covered to hurl
yourself out of perfectly serviceable
aeroplanes, climb walls and moun-
tains "because they're there", scrum
down with 15 other sweaty, beer
swilling , heavily muscled berserkers
(with apologies to 'Vicky' the
Viking) and ... play table tennis. Um,
yes, that's right, somebody some-
where has decided that Ping-Pong
falls into the same category, insur-
ance wise, as sky diving.
OK, one could argue that an errant
forehand smash could leave a nasty
bruise but, how about aerobics? Fair
enough, you might slip on a sweaty
leotard but how can one possibly jus-
tify players of Bridge needing insur-
ance. Do they expect the deck to
explode? That someone will tear
their ligaments picking up an unusu-
ally heavy two of Clubs? Maybe a
highly stressed player will crack
under the strain of a particularly tense
rubber and will run
amok with a vis-
cously sharpened
scoring pencil.
Somebody, some-
According to Sports Manager: Frank
Murray, Activities Cards are not
compulsory, they are "recommend-
ed". Okay, this ain't exactly Lois and
Clark stuff (although I am better
looking than Dean Cain) but it does
suggest that somebody up the hierar-
chy is misinform-
somebody somewhere ing the people
has decided that below. Whether it's
Ping-Pong falls into deliberate I could
the same category,
where, is either insurance wise, as sky
very paranoid or is diving
taking some
extremely powerful narcotics.
Still, back to the story. I must have
been told "I'm sorry, you have to join
or you can't play." at least a dozen
times at the Freshers' fair but a spot
of investigative journalism has
uncovered a large scale scam:
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A
CARD TO PLAY!
Yup, you are being mislead.

But why do we
need extra insur-
ance anyway?
Union membership provides insur-
ance for students taking parts in club
activities and many sports clubs have
their own policies to cover public lia-
bility, especially those that are affili-
ated to their governing body. The
Rugby club for example is insured up
to £5 million through the RFU. The
College has what was described by
the Finance Office as a "massive
insurance policy" which covers you
for anything that has a bonafide asso-
ciation with Imperial whether it is a
chemical spill or a spontaneously
combusting pack of cards.
The interesting bit however is the
fact that the Finance Office didn't
know anything about this, ergo it
doesn't have anything to do with
them (really Sherlock?). So, the big
question is: who came up with the
whole idea in thefirstplace?
Yet more detective work ensued
and after a bit of lying, weaselling,
pleading and bribing (OK, not strict-
ly true but it makes it sound so much
more interesting) I managed to get
my grubby hands on the Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies)
Council report (15th October, 1996)
which had this to say:
"Insurance: Members of all sport-
ing clubs have now been asked to
obtain an Activities Card. This pro-
vides the holder with BUSA Gold
Plus cover during participation of
organised Union activities.
Unfortunately we are having to
charge £1.50 to cover the cost of
insurance, printing and lamination
costs. We will more that (sic) likely
be able to get them sponsored for
next year."
So what is the Card for precisely?
It appears to do exactly the same as
the College policies. The Council
report informs us that "I have already
begun to implement (this policy) due
to the call for extra insurance cover,
and the five claims I already need to
put in." So it could be it is a knee
jerk reaction to cover somebody's
ass. The author does concede that
he/she/it "would like to express my
concerns in how effective it will be
this year."
Yet more digging around got me
through to Sarah Corneille, the most
informative person I'd spoken to dur-
ing the investigation, and somebody
who actually appeared to know what
was going on.
The policy was initated by Tim
Townend, her predecessor, who had
in turn been asked by the College on
behalf of the clubs. Apparently there
a number of accidents last year and
the College insurance, which was
described as "minimal", didn't cover
them so, on the recommendation of
BUSA (British Universities' Sports
Associations), the Union took out
this extra policy to cover personal
injuries and stuff like dental care.
Does this mean that before this
year we were dangerously under
insured or alternatively that we're
paying for a policy we don't need (I
know that it's only £1.50 but that is
the equivalent of three sandwiches
form the Sandwich Shop after four)?
Either way nobody seems to know
what is going on, which is the gener-
al impression I seem to have gar-
nered during my time at Imperial.
Hence forth I suggest a 'teach the
right hand to speak to the left hand'
campaign. Comments, suggestions,
donations, abuse and free tickets to
prestigious parties should be sent to
the usual address.
And so I trudge back to my office,
hang up my mac, loosen my tie, put
my feet up on my desk and crack
open a bottle of bourbon satisfied in
the knowledge that it was another
case...
not quite solved.
