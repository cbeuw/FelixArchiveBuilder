F E L I X S P Q R T
IC football on a high
"LSD" swallow bitter pill against firsts
With half the football club still
coming down from Friday's festiv-
ities, I.C. Firsts came right back up
with another boosting victory
against last years high fliers. With
the notable absence of "Fat Boy"
(again) and "Archie", the rest of us
stormed on to kick LSE. all over
the park. With Psycho having a rel-
atively "bloodless studs" game, it
was left to young Jamie to show
the rest what to do. Debutante
Chris Parsons seemed to think the
game ended early, hitting the bar
twice, when even Phil "only
scores drugs and birds" could have
bagged one. Thankfully, Tke did
what he's paid for, putting us one
up, before Arno " shot up" the
LSE. defence, between 18 men,
including most of our team, to
score the most outrageous goal in
I.C. history! At half-time, happily
2-0 up, we ate oranges. Little did
we know that they had been
drugged, allowing LSE. to score
the most off-side goal ever, despite
an outstanding block by David
"honest, Roy is my cousin" Keane.
However, a little "injection of
speed" brought us out of it, allow-
ing our 100% record to be main-
tained. Keep doing the pills, lads!
Seconds saved by own goal
After a pre-match warm up at the
Complex nightclub, Phil, Steve,
Laurence and Donal took their
place in the seconds line up wide
eyed and eager for the game.
Captain Steve Fleming's five at the
back formation looked solid with
Chris Parsons having an outstand-
ing match. However, even with
I.C. having the majority of posses-
sion, the front pairing of Martin
and Alex saw little of the ball, and
RFH. proved to be dangerous on
the counter, taking the lead mid-
way through the first half.
The second half saw two substi-
tutions; Felix on for Hajo, and
Dave on for Phil, who had to leave
the field due to "something he ate"
the night before. I.C. stepped up a
gear, and were rewarded with an
equaliser via a Chris Parsons back
pass through the keepers legs from
25yds. I.C. maintained the pres-
sure, especially through Laurence
on the right, who must have
thought he was still clubbing as he
kept trying to score. Victory came
as Felix sent a deep free kick into
the box, where under pressure from
Alex one of their fullbacks rose
like an idiot to head into his own
net.
Asked after the game how the
new formation had worked, captain
Steve was quoted as saying it was
"Sorted!"
Fourths make it three in a row
The fourths again managed a
win in their toughest test of the
season. Conceding their first goals
of 1996, I.C. made tough work of
this BUSA game, against LSE. -
who were economical with their
footballing skills. Yet again man-
of-the-match went to Darren - this
time with four goals. Nak and
Chris also scored quality goals.
However, the team was let
down by poor defending, in partic-
ular by keeper Stuart. The worst
mistake was a complete misjudg-
ment when a shot from half-way
bounced 10yds out from goal, and
over the floundering keepers head.
The ball being stolen from
Geordie David in defence certain-
ly made a change from his usual
thieving exploits.
Nak and Mike made up, howev-
er, with a superb display in mid-
field.
IC Volleyball
escape jail
Ever thought what it was really like
to be in prison? Well I.C. Volley did
it, with some style! The men's team
played in Wormwood Scrubs on
Saturday in a league match. After an
endless wait to get into prison (elec-
tronically locked doors, scanning of
bags, escort asking permission to
cross thefields),I.C. players put on
an impressive display for a team
which had never played together
before, not even in training. True,
the mixture of inmates and staff
from the well known nineteenth
century prison were never a threat
for our team, hardly scoring more
thanfivepoints every set.
The final score was 15-5, 15-3,
15-4: an emphatic win which will
boost the confidence for the next
three matches in three weeks.
Gary Hoare
triumphs for I.C.
X-Country
A beautiful day heralded the start of
the cross-country season, with solid
performances throughout the team.
After a sedate start, where most of
the runners were left on the line
chatting, I.C. picked up the pace,
producing excellent individual
results from Fishick, Ponytail and
Gaffer, coming 8the, 12the and
17the respectively.
With the womens team coming
second, these results provide a
good foundation for kicking the
butts of the remaining U.L.U. col-
leges again.
The teams left Parliment Hill
with chants of Gary Hoare ringing
in their ears, and Holloway whim-
pering.
Fencing : Mixed Fortunes
The IC men's fencing team began
the season with a friendly against the
Royal Free. The foil was won con-
vincingly, 8-1, and the sabre was lost
narrowly, to give an overall 12-6 vic-
tory. The team was : Eddie, Nick,
David, Mo and Reuben
The women's team played their
first BUSA league match against
Queen Mary & Westfield. Despite a
few injuries, the team put in a spirit-
ed effort, but unfortunately lost 15-3
overall. The fencers were : Linda,
Monica, Elaine and Davinia.
