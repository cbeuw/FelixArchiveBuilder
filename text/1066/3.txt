AUT plans Autumn strikes over pay
MARIA IOANNOU
The threat of a one-day strike looms
over UK universities this week as a
broad coalition of Trade Unions,
including the Association of
University Teachers, goes to the bal-
lot box over pay.
The National Executive
Committee held an emergency meet-
ing on Wednesday morning where
they voted to ballot all HE affiliates
on whether to hold a National Higher
Education shutdown in November.
AUT figures show that salaries for
main-grade lecturers have been cut
by half a per cent in real terms since
1981, compared with the pay
increases of 23 per cent above infla-
tion awarded to schoolteachers and
hospitals managers over the same
period.
The General Secretary of the
A*UT, David Triesman, expressed
his concern: "All groups in the pub-
lic sector have had to deal with an
effective pay freeze over the last two
or three years, but university staff
have been putting up with one for
more than fifteen."
If the outcome of the ballot is, as is
confidentiy predicted, a 'yes' vote,
then the resulting stoppage would be
the first wide-scale industrial action
in the HE sector for more than ten
years.
The National Union of Students
immediately pledged support for the
strike plan. Embracing the AUT's
cause, NUS president Douglas
Trainer spoke of solidarity, "Students
are suffering in the crisis of higher
education cuts. It is vital that we
unite with lecturers, teaching staff
and other trades unions against the
crisis on campus."
Representatives from ICU were
somewhat less vociferous in their
support of the strike. Upon hearing
the news, President Eric Allsop
adopted a carefully considered
approach, "We are in a very difficult
position, caught between a rock and a
hard patch. The AUT have a perfect-
ly valid protest, and so we'd like to
back them on this issue. However, if
pressure is put on the College to pro-
vide extra funding, it will mean that
they will have to look for additional
money from alternative sources,
namely top-up fees. This is some-
thing the Union wishes to avoid, so
we're faced with a dilemma."
Mary's Sabb funding in place
KENT YIP
After much campaigning by St
Mary's Hospital Medical School
Student Union, funding for a sabbat-
ical presidential post has finally been
secured. This should see the transfor-
mation of the current position into a
full time role for at least five years.
The president will receive an
annual salary of Â£8,000. The funding
is understood to be coming from St
Mary's current subvention, and other
sources and trusts associated with the
medical school.
Speaking to Felix, Piers Williams,
Deputy President (Finance and
Services) of ICU, was unaware that
funding for the post had been found.
He did however recall that a motion
relating to this matter had been
passed in an ICU Council meeting
last year. In principle, the Council
had voted in favour of this change,
provided that St Mary's Union were
able to come up with the required
funding.
Sami Ansari, the current Mary's
President, expressed his view that the
new sabbatical nature of the job
would allow future presidents "to
lead a normal life, to enjoy what the
College has to offer, instead of hav-
ing to miss out on all the social and
sporting activities, as is presently the
case." He pointed out that, on top of
his clinical study, on average he
spent over 6 hours a day in meetings.
Mr Ansari went on to explain that
"the nature of the job has changed
fundamentally over the last five
years. Issues that past presidents did
not have to deal with directly, such as
changes in the curriculum, the con-
structions of the BMS building,
finance of the clubs, provision of
recreational space and sports ground,
are all of a pressing nature at the
moment."
"That person must have the confi-
dence of the student body and the
selfbelief in doing a goodjob. Future
presidents would be strongly advised
to carry out the job sabatically.Given
that the new intake is going to be
around 320, an enormous amount of
work will be required."
The Mary's President summarised
the dedication needed for the job by
saying, "You take on this job
because you care. You must believe
in what you are doing, and that it is
all worth it at the end of the day."
