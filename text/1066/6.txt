windows. Can
you believe, Mr
Caldwell, that
someone made
the crass com-
ment that 'you
don't want to live
in Alcatraz.' I
know, it's dis-
graceful. With
such stringent
security, the last
thing you would
want is for a set of
keys to get into
the wrong hands.
Oh dear. A set of
master keys was

hear you cry, just a matter of chang-
ing the locks. Overheard snatches of
conversation say that it took four
days to change the external locks and
seven weeks to place the order for
new internal ones. Another story
drifting over the tables of Southside
bar told of a resident whose lock
jammed, was removed after 24 hours
and replaced after three days.
Still, you say, there's always the
insurance. Oh dear. Because of the
absence of deadlocks, experienced
crime prevention officers who have
had a look at the place say that no
insurance company appears willing
to take on business at Clayponds.
But, I hear you cry, there is the
College policy. Oh dear. Maximum
basic cover is £2,200. Not too bad,
until you realise that as from this
year, apparently,
the maximum
cover on any one
item is £600, not
much use for a
computer, which
students have
been known to
p o s s e s s .
Additional cover
for expensive bits
clocks in at a
massive 12% pre-
mium. With this,
allegedly, the
absolute maxi-
mum cover they
will let a student
have is £5,000.
Strangely, this is
rumoured to be
the College's excess on the policy.
Therefore, all claims are met by IC.
Clayponds has some very smart
cookies and some of them were men-
tioning, while I queued up at
DaVinci's, that the total payout for
last year must be about £100,000.
I'm not the man from the Pru, but
this strikes me as a less than entirely
suitable policy for insuring residents'
property.
All these measures would be very
expensive, you say. Whatever policy
they have will carry an excess,
though a policy that would pay out
only if Ealing was sucked into the
sun seems to have scope for
improvement. Cash is tight these
days. Bloody Government, you say.
Oh dear. Even though the building is
only five years old, it has recently
car, mobile phone,
mortgage and a sweet
little suburban pair of
smiling kids.
This is the problem.
The degree is no
longer a mark of
learning, of experi-
ence and knowledge,
- in the course of duty -
breaking the cycle
means losing money,
and losing money is
fundamentally bad.
Of course, I am not
saying that no stu-
dents are there for the
right reasons (to learn,
to gain understanding
imagination to complete it in the best
way possible, thus gaining from it
intellectually. The other was to com-
plete it by rigorously obeying the lec-
turer's hints and tips, and following
his spoon-fed orders from start to fin-
ish, thus learning nothing at all.
Which method should I choose? the
simple answer is that I should choose
the latter, because it is the one which
Well, what a week it's been. Not
only has Des Lynam signed a new
four year contract (he was quoted as
saying "The BBC isn't an employer
to me. It's a cause." Pure genius), but
my dear old friend Ian Caldwell has
finally honoured me with a response
to one of my pieces. The man says he
often agrees with me, so he can't be
all bad (some may think this deeply
disturbing, but there you go).
Continuing this spirit of amicability,
I have decided to be nice to Mr
Caldwell this week, and give him a
flavour of what's currently on parts
of the Estates grapevine that he may
not have heard. I was initially going
to say something just about
Montpelier Hall, the sale of which
could net the College several million,
and is easily justifiable for this rea-
son alone, but then I started hearing
about rumblings at another postgrad
encampment, Clayponds. If the
rumours are true, it would seem that
the inmates are restless.
It would appear that security is a
major concern, not unreasonably, of
the residents. I hear that they average
one break-in every ten days, which
means that, with 130 houses, the
chances of getting done over a year-
are a tad higher than the national
average. Allegedly, most burglaries
are effected by jemmying ground
floor windows. The situation is not
helped by doors having glass panels
and no deadlocks. College refuse,
apparently, to install deadlocks
because of cost, yet will not let resi-
dents fit their own. Nor will they, I
recently overheard, install bars on
There seems to be a problem at
Imperial. A problem so great, so
ingrained, so paradoxical that few (if
any) have noticed its existence. The
problem is work, and what it is for.
Week after week, lecturers and
teaching staff churn out assignments
for the students without stopping for
a moment to ask themselves what the
assignments are for. Week after
week, students plough through these
assignments with equally little regard
for why they are doing them; or
rather, they have a reason but it is the
wrong one. Why are you doing this?
I might ask, and the reply is invari-
ably 'because I need the marks',
Why do you need the marks?
'Because I want to get my degree';
and why do you want the degree?
Because you need it to find a decent
job with a nice pay packet, company
but it is simply a meaningless quali-
fication; but although it has no mean-
ing it is nevertheless a necessary and
required qualification. Therefore,
year after year millions of students
and staff go through the charade of
pretending to learn, pretending to
teach, simply so the machine can
carry on moving; and they are all
reluctant to break the cycle because
and experience); many of them are -
but they do seem to be the minority,
and the difficulty for them is that the
system is geared towards the majori-
ty. This is a problem, because it can
turn teaching into a farce. For
instance I recently had an assignment
which I could have completed in two
ways. One was to take the assign-
ment and use my intelligence and
been entirely re-carpeted. Strolling
along the walkway one day, I heard
someone mention that this cost
£150,000. That's a lot of shagpile by
my reckoning. So let me get this
straight. No cash for locks and bars,
loadsamoney for axminster. And did
I forget the new common room,
allegedly to be costing £45,000? The
residents have seemingly been
offered a daily patrol if they are pre-
pared to stump up an extra £2.50-
£3.00 per week. That wouldn't seem
too bad if the previous had not been
done or planned. Wandering through
the library (they're all talking about
this, you know), I heard that Security
have asked if the residents would
help in planting 'deterrent shrub-
bery.' So you can plant spiky bushes,
but notfitlocks.
It's not all bad, though. They are
very sensibly trying to cut the energy
bill at Clayponds. Oh dear. Changed
all the 100W bulbs for 60W low
energy ones. Result? People can't
read in their rooms, so they have
switched on additional lamps. But in
the corridors, they save lots, you say.
Would if they'd changed those
bulbs, mate. They commissioned a
survey, apparently, so that's OK.
Boys and girls, being a chemist, I
have a keen sense of smell for all
sorts of nasty niffs. As Biology is a
related discipline (that second cousin
that Mother says we don't talk to,
mind), I have some skill in the scents
of animals. Here I detect a furry
rodent that has a penchant for the
Black Death.
Any comment?
will gain me most marks. So I find
myself left in a tricky situation -
either I gain the marks and the quali-
fications, or I gain the knowledge
and experience. Which do I choose?
Well, being a foolish idealist I would
always choose the latter, and suffer
for it - but how long will it be before
it is literally impossible to complete a
degree by using one's own initiative,
rather than blindly following orders?
Depressingly soon, I fear.
