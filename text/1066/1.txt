Clayponds crime
JACKIE S K E A T E
A spate of crime at Clayponds, the
College's South Ealing residential
estate, has been at the centre of rising
complaints of "inadequate" security
at the site. Just this term, inhabitants
have noted a significant number of
break-ins, currently about one every
ten days. The estate, situated in
South Ealing, currently houses 334
undergraduate and postgraduate stu-
dents in 130 separate houses.
Mr P Leeson, Clayponds Resi-
dential Superintendent, tells a differ-
ent story. He assured Felix that there
had been no burglaries for "about 4
weeks," and that the culprits had
been apprehended. One is serving a
two-year prison sentence, the other is
on remand, yet to appear in court. He
also stated that break-ins had only
occurred through ground-floor win-
dows. At the request of residents,
Crime Prevention officers from
Ealing Police have already visited
Clayponds, and have recommended
the fitting of deadlocks on all bed-
room doors and bars on all ground
floor windows. Students have mostly
agreed with this, "We wouldn't mind
it looking like Alcatraz if we got to
keep all our stuff," remarked one.
All the window locks have now
been replaced, though Mr Leeson
claims that students are not using
them. A meeting was held to discuss
the security issue on 13th October.
Attended by Prof Swanson, the Pro-
Rector, Ian Caldwell, the Director of
Estates, Graham Daniels, the
Residence Area Manager, and about
a hundred students. This meeting dis-
cussed the possibility of dummy TV
cameras, bars on ground floor win-
dows, and deadlocks. It was later
decided that deadlocks would be
pointless, as they would make it dif-
ficult to exit the room in case of a
fire, and there not had been, as yet,
any break-ins through doors.
Mr Daniels added that a lock was
only as strong as the door it was fit-
ted to, and that deadlocks were not
designed for internal doors. He
added that the cost of fitting dead-
locks on all the bedroom doors
would be "hundreds of thousands of
pounds." However, the College's
own figures show that deadlocks cost
under £100 each, so a simple calcula-
tion shows the maximum total cost
would be £33,400 for the 334 resi-
dents. Mr Caldwell dismissed the
possibility of putting bars on win-
dows, "We don't want the place to
look like Fort Knox. I once stayed in
a hotel room that had bars on the
windows...it was a grim experi-
ence."
College have also conducted an
independent review into Clayponds
security. As well as replacing all the
window locks, a new set of window
frames were ordered 6 weeks ago at
a cost of £17,000. These have now
been delivered, and will be fitted on
Monday. Also, Mr Leeson confirmed
that a "man and his dog" have been
hired at a monthly cost of £3,000
from a local security firm to patrol
the campus at night, and "deterrent
shrubbery" will be planted along the
wall where Clayponds borders a
council estate. This will consist of
"various sorts of bushes, roses, pyro-
canthia, anything with big spikes
on."

LSE won't Top-Up
ANDREW SMITH
The London School of Economics,
one of the leaders in the rush towards
'top-up fees', have abandoned plans
to make their September '97 intake
pay for tuition. "Administrative diffi-
culties" are quoted as the reason
behind the move, with students
expressing concerns that the '98
intake will not be lucky.
The decision announced last week
comes as a working party, set up to
examine the mechanics behind the
implementation of fees, continues to
discuss the proposals. It is under-
stood that the Acting Director of
LSE, Leslie Hannah, as well as other
senior officials are behind consistent
attempts to introduce the fees.
An LSE spokeswoman confirmed
that the 'Court of Governors' would
have to approve any new measures,
but refused to supply details as to
how much the fees, if introduced,
would be. Other sources suggested
thatfiguresof up to £1,000 are under
discussion. Unlike Imperial College,
LSE are facing seriousfinancialdif-
ficulties, despite income from their
large number of overseas students.
While LSE's Union believes that
tuition should be free, and continue
their attempts to persuade LSE
authorities of the same, they are cur-
rently working with LSE to provide a
scholarship structure should 'top-up
fees' be implemented. "We feel that
top-up fees would mean that only a
quota of people from lower econom-
ic backgrounds would be allowed
in", commented Sam Palmer, the
Educational and Welfare Officer of
LSE Student's Union.
The decision to postpone the intro-
duction of fees comes amid state-
ments from David Blunket, Labour's
Education spokesman, that his party
would 'claw back', by reducing
grants to third level institutions, any
money gained by tuition fees.
