IC's first home game of the season
saw the team deliver a convincing
victory against LSE.
Debutant centre Dave Gol opened
the scoring after some slick passing
and interplay between backs and for-
wards. Two tries by winger Marvin
Woodhouse kept the scoreboard tick-
ing over, although some slack
defence let LSE back into the game.
A mazey run by supermodel Andy
Mayes reasserted IC's dominance
before the break.
The team seemed to go off the boil
after the interval, but the fire was
restoked by Rob Gare, who is start-
...and the thirds
just have fun.
After failing to muster a team for last
Saturdays fixture against St Mary's,
IC thirds pieced together thirteen
players for Wednesday's fixture.
Barts were kind enough to loan us
one forward, which left us only one
winger short. Things started evenly,
with good defenses on both sides
keeping things level. With the wind
behind them, Barts managed to pin
us down in our own twenty-two for a
few minutes before their one man
ing to make a name as a try scoring
prop forward. Yes, they do exist!
It really should have been a crick-
et score, but further scoring was
restricted to a second try for Dave,
after a scintillating scissors move,
coupled with searing speed, resulted
in a try under the posts. Conversions
were something of a rarity, although
at the end of the day the win was still
convincing enough.
The second XV upstaged the firsts in
style, conceding only five points.
The awesome appearance of the IC
side had the frightening effect of
scaring the opposition into sickness,
even before the kickoff.
The game started well, with our
Lomu-esque winger, Kolone Peung
crashing over within minutes for the
first of his two tries. Further domi-
nance resulted in a sparkling "try of
advantage allowed them to open the
scoring. They unfortunately then
rapidly scored again, leaving IC 12
points down.
Shortly afterwards, the IC prop
made a good break, but was left con-
cussed from the double team tackle.
With our numbers once again down
to thirteen things stayed much the
same, with Barts breaking down
defence only twice more, leaving us
26 down at half-time.
The second half saw IC take the
upper hand, and with sound tactical
kicking, frequent opportunities to
steal the ball, and formidable maul-
the month" from scrum-half Yomi
Benson, and a try from half way by
centre and vice-captain Julian
"Logic" Harrison. Superb kicking
from fullback Jushin Lee (rewarded
with two conversions), and outstand-
ing support from Miles "Slim Boy"
Gilder also helped us in this out-
standing performance.
However, the team slackened off
in the second half, and conceded a
soft try in the final minutes.
Unfortunately, due to procedural
wrangles this match may have to be
replayed. Next time they will all be
puking beforehand.
ing, IC had a number of good attack-
ing sequences - but just fell short of
scoring several times. We sustained
yet more injuries - another mild con-
cussion, and a sprained ankle to
name but two - but we fought on.
Barts managed to make their advan-
tage in numbers show, and scored a
few breakaway tries, to end the game
52-0.
It was a truly magnificent perfor-
mance from IC, under harsh circum-
stances, where only the lack of num-
bers (and perhaps fitness) showed. A
good showing for our first match
together!
Sport in brief
Hockey Seconds perform
Mission: Impossible
This was a prime example of a game
of two halves. The game started with
a phase of good pressure, which led
to Shaggy stroking in a cross from
PD File. End to end play followed,
with Holloway gaining ascendancy.
This led to a series of short corners,
from which Holloway scored three
times. IC were forced to hold out
until half-time.
Filled with hellfire and brimstone,
IC started the second half with a true
sense of purpose. A delightfully
struck, defence splitting, pass from
Leightweight found Shaggy
unmarked, and he duly slotted in a
second. A few minutes later saw
Shaggy alone at the top of the "D".
Moments later he secured his first
hat-trick with his annual well-struck
goal.
More intense pressure followed,
leading to a long corner. Once taken,
the ball arrived at Rich Brunt, and he
slammed the ball into the back of the
net.
At this point Holloway were
destroyed, as IC pressed forward,
with effervescent vigour. It was
unsuprising therefore, when towards
the end of the half, Shaggy again
found the net with a reverse flick.
Pure disbelief flowed from the
Holloway side, 3-1 up at half-time,
they were now 5-3 down. IC stormed
the second half, to win through
against impossible odds.
WOMENS FOOTBALL
After a rather uncharacteristic start to
the season, IC Ladies, bedecked in
warpaint, came good.
LSE took the lead twenty minutes
in, with a brilliant strike from 20yds
out. LSE scored twice more, before
Jo Staton pulled one back, notching
up the Painted Laides' first goal of
the season.
In the second half, IC played
bravely , but LSE made the most of a
few lucky chances to take the game.
Even so, IC showed a return to form,
which should serve as a warning to
other teams - the Painted Ladies will
be a force to be reckoned with.
TENNIS
The mens team had tough opposition
in their first match, with only Arnau
and Alex securing another victory.
The womens team had more luck, as
their opposition failed to turn up!
BASKETBALL
After a long summer of no play or
training, most players left IC antici-
pating defeat. However, the match
against Holloway ended in a 36 - 24
victory for IC. We shall triumph
again!
