DOES THE ICU Executive need to
be expanded? This Is one of the most
fundamental constitutional issues to
hit the Union for some time. The
question was broached very early in
the year when the President asked the
rest of the Executive to consider having
three more officers as members. These
were the officers responsible for
External Affairs, Academic Affairs and
Postgraduate Affairs.
The majority of the Executive
decided to block the first two but agreed
that there could be a case for letting
the Postgraduate Affairs Officer become
a member.
Despite the fact that the Exec have
allowed the PGAO to be present at all
their subsequent meetings, the overall
feeling pro his becoming a full member
has since altered to one of neutrality.
The bland phrase conceived was 'trie
Executive have been unable to reach a
decision on this Is^sue'. The motion
originally drafted for presentation at a
UGM which would have finalised the
PGAO's Executive status has been
withdrawn because the original proposer.
John Mortimer (President of RSMU), has
essentially changed his mind. The
seconder, Peter Teague (President of
RCSU), Is apparently unchanged in his
attitude. In next week's F E L I X we will
be publishing a feature based on this
subject. Presenting the case for the
adoption of the PGAO as an Executive
member will be Trevor Phillips (Pres-
ident of ICU) & Ton Abraham (PGAO);
and presenting the case against will be
Ron Kill (Dep. President) and John
Mortimer. Part of the discussion will
be based on statistics gleaned from
other UK Colleges and Universities
regarding the size and composition of
their Executives. We have also received
significant comments from John Carr
(President of ULU and NUS Executive
member) and John Randall (President
of NUS).
Should anyone feel strongly enough
about the subject, please feel free to
air your views in the 'Letters' column.
One can only speculate on the
success or otherwise of today's
National Grants Demonstration, but I am
pessimistic about what it will achieve
even with the large turn-out which
John Randall expects.
Recognising that cutbacks in ed-
ucation have already been planned by
the Government, to expect an additional
outlay in educational spending is
optimism in the extreme. It smacks of
that old tactic 'let's aim high and then
compromise'.

A Letter to the Rector.*
Old Chemistry Building,
8th November, 1974.
Sir Brian Flowers,
Rector,
Imperial College.
Dear Rector,
We represent the post-
graduates in the Department
of Chemistry, and are writing
to you concerning the con-
struction of a 'landscape
gai ien with shrubs', described
m this week's edition of
C, to be built on the
ntel of land ormerly occupied
by part of tiie old RCS building
and designated for stage II of
the new Chemistry building.
The first two pages of the
same issue of TOPIC were
occupied by a memorandum
from the Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals
describing the financial
difficulties facing British
Universities, as a direct
result of which research
facilities needed by post-
graduates and staff are steadily
worsening in both this and
other Departments of the
College, with the future
becoming progressively bleaker
if the present trend of financial
cuts is continued.
The proposed garden wjll
do little to enhance the view
of the vicinity, owing to the
half-demolished, half-built
state of the buildings which
surround it on ' three sides,
and we are disgusted that at
present trine, money can be
wasted on such trivia.
Is it possible for the
College Administration to
justify this presumably not
inconsiderable expenditure for
dubious cosmetic purposes, in
view of the present precarious
financial situation, and could
the money involved not be
better employed in improving
the buildings from which the
garden and shrubs are intended
to distract the attention?
Yours sincerely,
R.B. Jones,
S.J. Roberts.-

Sir,
I feel I must protest about
Mr. Phillips' self-centred
interests in human suffering in
other countries. His remarks
about an ICL computer being
used for administration in
South Africa, and so per-
petuating apartheid, seem very
minor compared to the amount
of suffering and killing carved
by the computer systems
installed in US ships and
aircraft, and also those of the
O A etc.
It seems then, that Mr.
Phillips thinks we should
buy American and condone the
napalm in g of Vietnamese
villages etc. in years gone by,
and does not care about anyone
except his 'race', or he is just
continuing his left wing policy
of denigrating anything British.
The computer is merely a
rod of those who use it. Its
sale has nothing to do with
politics, and so we should
simply buy the best available,
instead of prattling on about
some dubious economic
connection.
Yours,
Pete Lynch

Sick criticism
Computing and Control
Dept.,
8th Nov. 1974.
Sir,
We find the letter from
'Relieved' of Chem. II, in
F E L I X 8th Nov., a very sick
criticism of homosexuality.
Perhaps, if more people in
Chem. II had been reasonable
and friendly to another human
being, it would not have been
necessary for D. Duce to have
formed GaySoc, let alone have
left IC for Sheffield.
Just because the guy was
big enough not to hide his
sympathy for homosexuals, this
should not bring him under
attack from somebody not even
prepared to identify himself.
Yours,
Tony MilboHni,
A. Alonso,
R.Cameron.
