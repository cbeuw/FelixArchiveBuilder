Indian
Diwali - India's Festival
of Lights.
Diwali, (which is an abb-
reviation of Deepawali) falls
in the later part of October or
the first part of November
depending on the vagaries of
the lunar calendar. This year
the Diwali falls on November
13th. Its religious and my-
thological roots can be traced
back to the Ramayana, one of
the two gnat epics of ancient
India, which centres around
the legendary hero, Rama.
Upon the promptings of his
third wife, Rama's father King
Dasharatha of Ayodhya (a
Kingdom which covered most
of Eastern U.P.) exiled him
for a period of 14 years. Rama
was accompanied in exile by
his wife Sita, and by the eldest
of his three brothers, Laxmana.
One day, while Rama and
Laxmana were out hunting,
Sita was abducted by the Demon
King Ravana of Lanka (in
Ceylon). The Ramayana tells
in details how Rama organised
a great host and crossed to
Ceylon on a bridge of stones
to give battle to Ravana and
rescue Sita. The defeat of
Ravana is celebrated in the
feast of Dussehra, which
occurs about three weeks
before Diwali. Diwali marks
the return of Rama, Laxmana
and Sita to Ayodhya. It is said
that their return was marked by
scenes of tumultous rejoicings
and that the people of Ayodhya
welcomed them back by lighting
up their houses with earthen
lamps.
Thus symbolically, Diwali
celebrates not merely the
reunification of the family,
but also a return to the rule
of law, for Rama has come
back to claim the throne which
as Dasharatha's eldest son,
is rightly his.
But whatever the symbolic
and mythological significance
of Diwali. its unique place in
the Indian calendar of fest-
ivities comes from its
association with things which
are much more basic and which
affect the feelings of the
people far more profoundly.
What makes Diwali bigger by
far than Guy Fawkes day in
England, or Jury 4th in
America, is its intimate con-
nection with the soil, with the
weather.
Diwali signifies the end
of the long lean season from
April to October, when the
spring harvests are in and the
winter crop has been planted.
Towards the end of October
the maize crop has been
harvested, and the early paddy
crop is lying cut and stacked
in the fields. The main paddy
crop is maturing, and the
countryside is a waving sea
of green.
The days shorten, the sun's
rays slant more and more in
the late afternoon, and their
fierce whiteness is tinged with
gold. An unbroken succession
of cloudless sunny days lie
ahead, until the winter rains
quicken the soil for the fruit
it will bear in spring. Winter,
the time of plenty, lies ahead.
