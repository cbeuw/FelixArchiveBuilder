DR. WOLFF gave a fascinating lecture on a side of medical
engineering that tends to get forgotten. Too much work is being
done on artificial limbs at the detriment of the psychological side.
Man has been living in
communities for the last
20,000 years; on an evol-
utionary time scale. Man has
not become used to the
conditions imposed. Little
work has been done to measure
stress in every day-situations,
or to measure heartbeat,
sweating and so on.
But this was impossible
only about ten years ago, and
only with the introduction of
SAMIs, Socially Acceptable
Measuring Instruments, that
can measure parameters like
pulse rate but are very compact,
has any reel advance been
made in the field.
Dr. Wolff then showed some
ingeniously simple devices
that have been made for
pensioners to help them stay
Independent: an inflatable air
cushion that helped them
stand up from easy chairs was
the most ingenious. There are
many more partly disabled
pensioners then people needing
artificial kidneys, so it is an
important field.
Or. Wolff then • changed
direction to talk about re-
presentation of data. He
showed a slide of a typical
symptoms cars: it was virtually
undecipherable. So he has been
working on visual readout
techniques. This consists of a
card (or CRT) with eight axes
spreading out from a central
origin. A single circular shape
passing through the appropriate
points on the axes gives an
instant sum up of the patient's
condition.
To take the same readings
with a machine as can be taken
with the finger on the pulse
would take an enormous unit
which would have to measure
about six difficult parameters.
A computer cannot compare
with a man at reading data.
But it seems that when we
recognise things or people we
only actually recognise certain
features. We were shown
pictures of teddy bears: despite
•the fact that they were only
made up of buttons, everybody
agreed they had definite
expressions.

WELLSOC has about half a
dozen lectures to come this
term: the next one is RIOT
CONTROL IN ENGLAND TOO?
If you riot often, it might give
you some food for thought. If
you don't, it should still
fascinate you.

What a Waste of M o n e y !
I refer, of course, to all
those of you who paid their
subscription fees to our'worthy
club and who have not yet
attended even one function.
This also stretches to those
who have only come once —
there is no excuse for such
behaviour — you can't be busy
every Wednesday night if you
bothered to join in the first
place, Any way, there is still
time to make up for your
hitherto unworthy absence.
Unfortunately for you, you have
already missed some excellent
concerts, like Gary and Vera
last week to name but one, but
you can take comfort in the
fact that if you are a member,
you can come to our future
brilliant musical extravaganza
(! got that from a Rag Mag --
how come our Rag Mag isn't
literate like that?) at an
incredibly generously reduced
rate of 20p per night But
honestly, don't you think that
it is a waste or money to pay
the subscription and not come
to any of the events? Now, I'll
bet you're all thinking, why
are they complaining, they've
got their money? Weil, I'll tell
you. We aren't concerned with
making a won .
of our club, and to do that we
need YOU; the committee iook
a right load of twats singing
along to choruses on their own,
we need some moral support....
or immoral support i f anyone
feels that way inclined. (Offers
accepted through the Union
Letter Rack).
Our biggest boast this term
in my opinion whatever others
might think, is the Fred Wedlock
concert in the middle of rag
week i.e. Wednesday 27 th
November. Fred Wedlock is an
incredible guy from Bristol,
which is enough in itself to
warrant attendance, and he has
a wide collection of songs,
both traditional and dirty — and

ELECTROMAGNETIC DYNAMICS
BREAKTHROUGH AT I.C.

Research workers in the Electrical Engineering Department
have recently made important discoveries regarding the behaviour
of oscillating couples in potential fields. Until now, little has
been known about the influence of external exciting- forces on
these couples but observations have shown that a certain
minimum potential is required
before oscillation can begin.
Once this potential is reached,
oscillation increases rapidly,
independently of the exciting
force, reaches a maximum, then
decays exponentially. Testing
hypothesis has been laborious
as results have varied widely
according to the type of couple
and the number of times the'
tests have been repeated using
the same couple. However, an
empirical formula for 'the
minimum potential required to
set a couple into oscillation
has been deduced:

further field studies and
couples are always welcome.

Sunday nights are now really
to be looked forward to, and
Sunday 3rd November was no
exception, with the return of
old favorites 'Tyger Banff.
They played trad, which was
fun to listen to through the
general beery haze that per-
vaded the Union Lower Lounge.
Their line-up has been
strengthened by the Inclusion
of Dave Channing on clarinet
who was to have been this
year's Jazz Club president,
but is now taking a year's
rest from his studies (a tactful
way of saying he failed). They
played a mixture of old fav-
orites, amongst which, 'Yellow
Dog B/ues', 'Nuts' (of George
MeTly fame) and their present
version of their signature tune,
were outstanding. It was only
a pity that the audience was
not larger; though-
what it
lacked In numbers was made
up in enthusiasm.
Next weeks free Sunday
session, will feature 'John
Waters Landscape', who play
Jazz-Rock, proceedings start
about 8.30 p.m.. so pick up a
pint and pop in.
boy, do Bristolians know how
to write dirty songs tee hee.
The epitomy of his anthology
is an updated version of the
Boxer, known as the Fu...no I
mean the Folker, which he must
do at all costs. Also, the pen-
ultimated week of term we have
arranged a ceilidh — so those
people who are interested in
making fools ...no, in enjoying,
themselves, should note that
well. The band will be North
Circular Accidental — of the
two ICWA ceilidhs fame. If you
want to learn this kind of
dancing before going to any
ceilidhs, try going to the
organiser of the Folk Dance
Club, Kev. Cole Elec.Eng. 3,
who will tell you when this
subsidiary of our club meets.
So you have no excuse, if you
don't like the kind of folk
music we play, just inform us
and we will take note of any
suggestions in the way of
artists to book in future years,
and comments like piss-
artists will be dealt with
severely.
