S t a n cross-country?
Imperial College,
8th Nov., 1974.
Dear Sir,
We, the resident cross-
country runners of the above
institution, are a bit pissed
off. Twice, in three weeks, we
have produced literary master-
pieces for your journal, in the
hope that we might once again
see our exploits gracing the
pages of FELIX. Both times,
not a word has been printed.
When you, referring to the
articles which you receive,
write: 'we simply feel duty
bound to print them all', we
feel duty bound to take you to
task on this false statement,
and to point out that, in our
case, it is simply not true.
We would also like to point
out that in past years, our
club has been one of the few
clubs which has even
BOTHERED to write an article
for FELIX. However, this
year, virtually all we have
had are articles from the
triumvirate of Soccer, Rugby
and Hockey — and the rest of
the sports clubs might as well
be extinct, as far as FELIX
is concerned.
We hope that you will take
steps to ensure that, in future,
when we submit articles, they
are not tossed aside because
they are not from one of the
afore-mentioned three.
Yours\
Wilt Welford,
(pp. IC Cross-
country Club)
(The Sports Editor writes:
As Sports Editor I feel
very disturbed by your- letter,
as it is on my shoulders that
the ultimate responsibility
lies. There is, in the Union
Lower Loungs, a notice, which
has been displayed all this
term, stating that if sports
clubs wished to have reports
published in FELIX, then they
should be submitted to ME
by no later than Monday
morning. However, the only
people who bother to do this
are members of the triumvirate
you mentioned. Only once
have I received a report from
the Cross Country Club and
that is published in this issue.
In the light of this may I
recommend that the Cross
Country Club follow the same
lines as other clubs and let
me -have their reports.
R. Jones.
P.S. If you are still not
satisfied, please fell free to
discuss tkis matter with me.).

THE NIGHTMARE OF NOISE
How loud the earthquake all around
Of heavy traffic on the ground.
How loud the ice-cream jingles cMme
For such a long, discordant time.
How loud the thunder in the sky
Of ceaseless aircraft passing by.
How therapeutic silence seems
Permitting thought, and sleep, and dreams.

The South East Asia Society is proud to present a sitar
recital on the 19th of November, 1974, at 7.00p.m. at the Great
Hall. In having this performance, the society hopes to bring an
understanding of the East by the West through music.
Eastern music is a form where the artist elaborates on a
fixed theme (or rage) — using all his abilities and emotions to
synthesise sounds which are portraits of his soul. The sitar Is
one of the most popular instruments of India. This popularity
is spreading into the West, initially through masters like Pandit
Ravi Shanker and Ostad Vilayat Khan, and now through artists
such as Shri Nikhil Banerjee and Shri S.L. Bhandari.
Shri S.L. Bhandari is an artist who draws inspiration from
the great masters of sitar such as Ustad Vilayat Khan and
Pandit Ravi Shanker. The sitar is a part of Shri Bhandari's soul.
His deep understanding of the ragas he plays and the rhythms
he improvises bring him closer to the transgression of the soul
to the infinite. Shri Bhandari's early training was with Professor
B.M. Dutta of Lahore. This has stood him in good stead over
the years and has led him to serve at the feet of his present
Guru, the great Shri Uma Shanker Mlshra.
Shri S.L. Bhandari will be accompanied by Shri R.S. Plaha
on the tabla. Shri R.S. Plaha domes- from a deeply musical
family and was Initiated into Indian classical music by his
father, a talented tabla player. At present he Is a disciple of
Ustad Allah Rakha.
The tanpura, an accompanying instrument will be played
by Miss Bina Chatterjee.
