Are YOU God?
I AM GOD. He is God. She is God. You are God. We are God.
They are God.
God, a common word, an everyday term that is used by
cornered, helpless, frustrated human beings when seemingly all
eise fails. A cry, a plea by demented creatures of little or no
self motivation. However, what is this cry aimed at (the sun, the
stars, statues, demi-gods, cows, Christ, the Spirit, the Holy
Ghost, Allah, gurus the computer?); is it heard; can it be
heard; if so is it acted upon; can it be acted upon;ror is it merely
the conscious trying to restablish a long since disused link with
the unconscious or psychic part of oneself.
'Man is very subjective in his thinking'. As exemplified by
the long held opinion that the earth was the centre of the universe,
(to the extent that anyone suggesting otherwise was hung) until
overwhelming evidence to the contrary came forth. Could the
same not be applicable to God?
Most people have the belief, if they have one at all/that man
was created in the image of God, not because a leprechaun
appeared in their bedroom, but merely because they believe man
to be supreme and all powerful in totality and finality. Thus in
essence they have created God in man's image. Therefore, man
is God and vice versa.
Gdd is good, if so how can countless Injustices and social
paradoxic* prevail in our society. GOD IS DEAD. Thus
Descartes' famous maxim */ think therefore I am' implying ex-
istence incandesces areas even his great intellect could not
fathom.
In a discussion about God one is inevitably drawn into a
discussion about morality and permissiveness. To quote Asimov,
'Never iet your sense of morals prevent you from doing what
is right'. More often than not discussions of this sort have
inherent socio-political camouflages. Thus the phoenix is
created, WHAT IS RELIGION?
