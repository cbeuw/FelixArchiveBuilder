THIS WEEK is Grants Action Week. At IC the main effort
will be attendance at the National Demonstration on Friday
(TODAY!). Coaches leave the Union Arch at 12.45 p.m.
So be there!
Trevor Phillips told FELIX
that he hoped to have gathered
a group of people to go to the
Parliamentary lobby in protest
against the Spouse's Contri-
bution which took place
yesterday (Thursday). He
called upon all IC students to
support the grants campaign.
While Imperial College
Union supports the idea of a
week of action, at the Nat-
ional conference in July we
proposed that the week of
action be held later in the
year. This was because of the
difficulty in mobilising freshers
and the fact that we all feel
better off due to the 25%
increase in the grant — which
however, only covers inflation.
Outers are, of course, • still
existing on low grants. The
Spouse's contribution is a
case in point, NUS's policy
is still to call for an end to
the Means Test and fair,
equal grants for all students
as a right,
Trevor Phillips considers
that many students have been
'bought off by the last grants
award' and that the Executive
have 'not had the time or
support to mobilise students'.
So prove him wrong!
THE NATIONAL Demonstration today takes place against a
background of economic crisis, financial uncertainty, and rising
social tensions. The question to be asked and answered is:
'Why a still higher grant, after the rise of up to 35%. this year,
in the present economic crises?'
A
Fair Grant
For ALL
Students!
The answer is simple:
This is not just a campaign
for higher grants. The sit-
nation is much more serious
than that. We are fighting not
only for the means by which to
live while undergoing onr
education; we are fighting for
that education itself.
We have seen already
some £182 million cut from the
education budget. We have
seen oar Rector warning of
the fate that faces the College
if Government aid is not
forthcoming by Christmas —
a complete exhaustion of onr
reserves inside 18 months." The
only other choice seems to be
a drastic, slashing cot in
services, courses, numbers of
students and staff at the
College. And that is the
seriousness of the situation.'
So it is not just a case of
stadents shouting 'more money'.
We are looking to save the
kind of standards of education
that we believe should be
preserved; in this we should
torn a common cause with all
others in the Education
sector. So we call on all those
m the College, not just
students, who share our view
to join us today.
The meaning of the lack of
funds in education is clear,,
in terms of student pockets.
We have heard one call from
the Rector for an extra £100
on the grant to meet the erosion
already caused by inflation,
We can see the hardship that,
the anomalies in the grant
system are causing to many
students, particularly post-
graduates and married students.
And there is still the Means
Test, to make parents (who
can ill afford it) pay for an
education that you have won
by your own efforts.
It is not enough for us to
say we support these aims.
We must show our support.
That is why every student
who believes that the ed-
ucation system should survive
should be out today, marching for
A FAIR GRANT FOR ALL
STUDENTS;
