ORIGINALLY from Devon,
but at the moment calling
Sussex her home, Sue Venner
is a fresher in the Department
of Life Sciences. Since
coming to Imperial College
she has managed to involve
herself in badminton, sailing
and ballroom dancing. She is
also involved in her hall of
residence (Selkirk) where she
was elected as the rep. for
staircase seven.
In her spare time she says
that she enjoys drinking. What
does she think of the male/
female rati*? 'It's rather nice.
It makes it interesting for us'.
Say no more.

JULIA DUNNING
ON THURSDAY, the 31st October, ICWA staged a Hallowe'en
Masked Ball. Apart from the groups, the evening ended in a
'Bobbing Apples' competition between the CCU's and ICWA
(which the Royal School of Mines nobly won). A good time was
had by all? True enough the departing crowds were full of com-
ments of 'Had a great time',
'A good evening, Julia',
'Wouldn't have missed it', etc.
etc. Always but ALWAYS
followed by these immortal
words 'Good-bye'.
Yes, I do think the evening
went well, despite the fact that
we lost money in putting it on.
This isn't my grumble. What,
however, do the members of
this Association expect from
its committee — slave labour?
To a large extort, I myself am
at fault as ! was absent during
the preparation of the food-that
afternoon, and to those people
left to this thankless task, I
should like to apologise.
Even so, how much dif-
ference does one pair of hands
make? What all this means is,
apart from a Christmas lunch
party, we are just not going
to be able to put any more
major functions on this term.
It will only be when we get
more substantial offers of help
that I feel the Association will

MUCH TO the relief of ail concerned and not least IFU
President Katie Mackinnon, the mystery of the disappearance of
Alexandre Bear has been solved. A dim view is taken of treasure
hunt clues that have to be paced out well after dark amongst the
prickly bushes of Linstead Hall gardens.. What was lost, 'bared'
or otherwise, has now been
found in the shape of a 21st
birthday present, and safeiy
returned, but we take this
opportunity to publicly
denounce Culprit Pat Gorman
and warn him ' Beware r
Another disturbing feature
of this history has been the
evidence of corruption in the
heart of IF Union; the rot
exists in the form of our
Vice-President who unas-
hamedly declared herself
accomplice to the outrageous
plot. Would not the Union's
time be better spent in pre-
paring an accounts' sheet of
their annual expenditure of our
hard-earned pennies!
Corruption, better known
as French Slipperyness, is
rather characteristic of the
college as a whole. The
administrative eel delights
in slipping out of any corner,
however tight, and leaves a
surface which is too shiny for
students to grip onto. Con-
sequently, for most students,
the college only exists in its
teaching capacity; they leave
the eel to its slippery devices
and devote their own energies
to better things beyond the
college precincts. It is a pity
1!
that so many of us could be'
called non-participant of
college life as such," but this
is obviously inevitable in an
institution so totally devoid
of facilities. The vast majority
applied only to gain secretarial
qualifications, however two
years are a long time to sleep-
wal., the daytime hours over
work, coffee and gossip. So
wake up you talented who have
lain dormant so long — and
write articles for this column
in FELIX.
Coffee will now be available every Friday lunch-time',

be able to carry out its function
properly. It's up to you now.
This apart, I should like
to make some reference to my
television interview on STOIC,
which also coincided with the
election of Mr. ICWA. Firstly,
Mr. ICWA.
His name — Dave Salisbury,
Student Residence Officer and
possessor of the knobbliest
knees I've seen in a long
while. My congratulations to
Dave — I hope he'll enjoy the
job.
Secondly, I was interested
in my interview to note the
look of surprise when I men-
tioned that the women here
get a rougher deal than the
men. It Is by no stretch of the
imagination. Utopian for us
here! Rather it can be quite a
nightmare when, apart from
being regarded as quite an
oddity, the attitude is that we
are a l l on to such a good
thing. RUBBISH! The sooner
this attitude changes, the
sooner IC will have a truely
viable social life.
Thanks for listening to me
anyway. I hope the topic of
discussion will be a little
livelier next week!
