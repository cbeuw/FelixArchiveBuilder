1 st XI
The first thing that struck
IC 1st XI hockey team on
arrival at Chinnor was the
state of the paddy field (or
pitch as they called it):
extremely waterlogged.
On loosing the toss IC were
left playing downhill with the
rain lashing into the opp-
ositions' faces. IC had a
slightly rearranged forward
41ne up and initially were not
linking together too well.
Nevertheless, steady pressure
was maintained throughout the
first half with any opposition
attacks being efficiently dealt
with by the IC defence. Jim
Marshall as right back had a
particularly good game
covering the left as well when
necessary. Keith Arrowsmith,
the midfield workhorse, seemed
to be everywhere, mopping up
in defence and setting up
attacks.
At half time we turned into
the rain and again battle
commenced in the mud. The
sticky conditions made ball
control difficult yet late in
the second half IC finally
scored when an attack on the
left found Bob Middleton (not
offside for a change) in space
in the centre. A pass to the
right caught the goalkeeper
off balance and Dave Lord
netted well. Great cheers from
our capacity crowd (2)! Final
score: Chinnor O-IC 1. Well
done lads!
Team: Roy Hutson; Jim
Marshall, Rich Cameron;
Kim Howden, Keith Arrowsmith,
Tim Hanson (Capt); Dave Lord,
lan Maclain, Bob Middleton,
John Andrews, Mike Vieyra.
IC 2nd XI, supplemented with third team faithfuls, turned up,
for their home match against Chinnor 2nd XI, with 12 players
plus trainer (a performance to date, this season). Chinnor did
less well, producing only 10 players. In our benevolant nature,
we offered a player to even the numbers and the lot fell upon
Ken Rawlings. _
Pete Nowell played a good
game in midfield and Dave
Haiders on put up his usual
dependable performance, but
otherwise I don't know what
happened to the rest of the
team that put 7 goals past
Goldsmith three weeks ago.
I hope players won't be too
diccouraged by the poor match
and that we can show im-
provement next week.
Inspite of beating us by
himself, I would like to thank
Ken Rawlings for his devotion
to duty over the last year. He
has been an invaluable main
stay in the halfbacks and he
always added a great deal to
the spirit of. the club.
From the bully I could see
it was a mistake to have given
away such a worthy player,
especially as it was his last
match for IC and consequently
determined to make an im-
pression. Cunning Ken ripped
through the field like a fart
in a gooseberry bush (Oh! sorry
Ken, didn't know you read
Felix) and scored the opening
goal, for Chinnor. IC rallied
to the extra challenge, though
and evened the score after a
penalty corner. Ken, not to be
outdone, however, appeared to
take us on single handed
before shooting home a second
goal before half time.
The second half was evenly
balanced with both teams
missing good scoring opp-
ortunities. Unfortunately the
ball didn't seem to run for IC
and there were some pretty
horrid errors from most players.

ftUGBy IC 1st v Barts
This second round match
of the Middlesex Cup took
place at Harlington on a Sunday
afternoon and all players
were pleased to have sup-
porters on the touchline.
IC started the match really
well and pressurised the
opposition line for the first
ten minutes, but failed to get
the pill under the sticks.
Shortly after this Bart's scored
their first try leaving the IC
team in confusion. B.Pants
started to loose his cool at
this point and of course started
blaming the backs; one member
was even screamed at for
fastening his boot lace. By
half time Bart's had added
two more tries and IC's only
points came from a fumbling
try by Ray Hughes, making the
score 22-6
At the interval the captain
got his rag out and tore most
of the team to pieces except
of course the magnificent front
five who were incidently
winning their own little game.
The oranges were quite juicy
anyway.
In the second half IC were
playing with the wind which
made things easier; and D.
Forbes kicked an early penalty
T H E A T R E
Angela Wye: 'The Rialto Prom'
directed by Sue Todd'.
THE PLAY was the first in a series
of amateur productions based on the
theme 'Sex and Consciousness' showing
at the 'Almost Free Theatre' in Rupert
Street, just off Piccadilly Circus. (Here
they are presenting short, half-hour
plays every lunchtime for which you
'pay as much as you can afford (!)' to
see).
'The Rialto Prom' (which was ex-
ceptionally well-cast) was all about a
group of Liverpoolian girls on the
proverbial 'Saturday-night out', and the
initiation ceremony they lay on for an
innocent newcomer. Before the packed
auditorium's eyes (grand total of about
fifty) they transform this rather prim and
proper 'beginner' into something app-
roaching an imitation beauty queen (tart —
you fool!). Anyway, it transforms, in the
end, that all this is in aid of fleecing
wallets off poor unsuspecting (gullible)
males.
The play is supposed to be a send-up
of the rigid conventions and sexual roles
and was unlucky with a couple
of other attempts. Plenty of
scrum ball was provided
throughout the game but there
was a great shortage of good
second phase ball and it is
rumoured that in between
scrums tha IC pack ripped off
for a cup of tea. Due to this
shortage of meaty possession
the IC backs found penetration
difficult even with some of
the female supporters pushing
them on from the touchline.
T/heir only success came after
a break by Ray Hughes with
M.Cotter scoring the try.
D.Forbes converted this
making the final score 28-15.
In the changing room
afterwards, it was noticed that
half the forwards had been
carrying spare meat round their
middle and the other half had
been carrying spare meat
dan "ing off their middle. It
has been suggested by some
of the supporters that these
people should be sent to the
donkey derby instead.

'The Puffin Joke Book' compiled by
Bronnie Cunningham, illustrated by
Quentin Blake. (Puffin).
THE SUCCESS of a joke depends
only partly on its intrinsic funniness;
a large part of the humour stems from the
surroundings and the person telling it.
That being so, it is a pity that the Puffin
Joke Book was laid out with such puerile
bonhomie. Perhaps that's what kids go
for today, but I can't help feeling that
there should be at least a taste of toffee
in the gaudiest wrapper.'
The jokes themselves were collected
from school-age kids, and on reading
through you should remember about half
of them and pick up dim memories of
satchels, homework and high voices. All
the same, conversations like:
Witch: '/ don't know why I bother with
yoy, you're just an idle old bonehead'.
imposed onto women by Society, and
intends to demonstrate the extent of a
girl's sense of power. (We thought this
last bit was a load of rubbish, but the
play was worth going to for a change and
a bit of a giggle).
Skeleton: 'That's right'.
are O.K. off the cuff, but should never
be preserved in print. The same goes for
a lot of the so-called witticism and
humour, especially the rewritten history
series. I also missed the inspiration In
the scribbllngs of Quentin Blake: the
pictures jusi luokeo ilice scribbles to me,
though I did like his rendering of four
smug sunglass-wearing elephants coming
over the hill. (Yes. I did recognise them).
The DOOK seems to be seeking the
Lear-Milligan-Hoffnung approach (or
copying it), but lacks their affectionate
sparkle and merely succeeds in being
silly. To be fair, there is some good
material, and if you collect jokes and old
rag mags or write comedy sketches it's
worth sifting through the garbage to find it.
Try giving it to your (very) little sister
for Christmas — she'll probably love it.
realised that there is nothing outstanding
in the book, though I thoroughly enjoyed
reading it.
Just the sort of material for a TV fWm,
though it wouldn't make a decent movie.
If you like lots of IF-type reasoning or
the idea of big time manipulators always
in the background you'll go for these
300-odd pages of straight entertainment.
