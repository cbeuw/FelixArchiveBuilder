IT IS college policy that, on academic grounds postgraduate
students should not be employed on work of a tutorial nature.
This is doubly unfortunate because not only does it withdraw a,
source of Income from hard pressed students (more about this
later), but it also denies those of us who hope to become lecturers
the chance of some teaching experience. At a time.when the
union is complaining about the quality of undergraduate teaching,
it is ironic that some union officers support college policy on
tutoring.
Many of you have been
circulated with a document
detailing the serious financial
position of universities and
colleges. The situation in
Imperial Co!lege is that we
face a £500,000 deficit in the
coming year. To combat this,
a 2
% cut on expenditure has
been instituted. However, since
there can be no cut on
'salaries' and maintenance,
this 2
% cut has to come from
other sources of expenditure.
It is in the light of this that
many departments have cut
down on demonstrating, with
the distinct possibility that
after Christmas demonstrating
will be phased out completely.
Postgraduates can on average
ears something in the region of
£120 by demonstrating. The
grant from the SRC is £960 and
so demonsl r sting pay con-
stitutes about 10% of the total
income. It is scandalous that
the financially weakest
members of the college have
to bear the major burden of the
expenditure cuts. We fully
accept that the College is
passing through a period of
acute financial stress, and
as such would only be too
willing to bear our fair share
of the burden provided other
members of the college are
also ready to make the
necessary sacrifices.
In the present situation it
is imperative that the IC
postgraduate group which
represents A L L the post-
graduates in the college,
meets and formulates policy
mandating the committee to
make the necessary repres-
entations. For too long, we
have been inconspicuous
within the college 'community'.
Rejected by the academic staff
and unable to come to terms
with the undergraduate oriented
students union, we have tended
to hide away in our little
comers in various parts of
this concrete jungle. It is time
that we got together and build
a strong postgraduate group,
and in this way improve both
the social and academic
aspects of life at this college.
There will be a meeting of
the IC Postgraduate Group on
Thursday the 21st November
at 1p.m. In Elec. Eng. 305,

RECENTLY a directive was issued by the Rector to the effect
that (and I quote only at n'tfs hand) no postgraduate may do any
teacwag of other students in the college unless this week is
supervised by the lecturer or another member of staff. It is also
said that there has been more specific ruling against PGs doing
any form of tutoring or work
involving assessment counting
towards a ' degree. Certain
explanations for these rulings
have been attributed to Sir
Brian, but these seem so
nonsensical that I would not
wish to insult him by repeating
them.
FELIX (Nov. 1) reported
the Rector as saying that
postgraduates may not do
tutoring: this bare statement
and these orders issued by
Sir Brian overlook several
points. First, that in the past
at this college PGs have
successfully undertaken all
these types of work with no
more supervision than that
given to members of staff doing
similar work. (Arguments
centered on what happens at
other universities are totally
DURHAM

R i c h a r d W a r i n g
THIS WEEK Students at Durham were voting on the issue of
the University's financial involvement in South Africa.
Following an intensive
focus of attention on the
issues at stake, Durham
students have an unprecedented
opportunity to. show the
University where its morality
should lie. The Vice Chancellor
has requested 'a clear mandate
from a well-informed majority
of the student body' before he
is prepared to disinvest, as he
acts as trustee for every
member of the University.
Durham Students Union is
asking members to vote for
disinvestment and hopes to
get 55% support. Whether the
Vice Chancellor will accept
this as sufficient is in dispute.
The decision to disinvest
will be taken in the light of
the student vote combined with
"that of the staff. The final
result will not be known until
the New Year when it is
expected that the Academic
Electorial Assembly will have
voted.
It is certain nothing will
be done unless the vote is a
large one in favour of dis-
investment. The Registrar is
quoted as saying, "It would be
a great pity if there wasn't a
substantial tum out at the
JCR's as it will beg the
question of what the silent
majority think'.
DSU is calling for each
student to pull his weight and
show the University that it has
'a clear commitment to see
liberty and justice returned to
the coloured population'.
dismissed so we'd best if
them too). Second, that certain
PGs are, in fact, currently
performing tutorial work, the
Rector* s injunction against
such practice having reached
departmental level some three
weeks into the term — well
after timetables had been
arranged according to previous
custom. ; The re-timetabling
thus caused has been disruptive
to all concerned. (This strange
timing and the lack of con-
sultation with PGs, UGs or
staff must cause some surprise
in view of the care taken by
the Rector in gathering
opinion about issues such as
computing and the use of
college facilities by outsiders.
Such hasty and perhaps i l l -
considered action seems
uncharacteristic).
Further, the type of work
actually involved in what is
termed demonstrating or
tutoring varies considerably
from department to department
and, while in some situations
supervision (whatever that
means) of the demonstrator
may easily be effected, in
others it may be entirely
impracticable or even meaning-
less concept. Implementing
college-wide such a decree as
has .'been made would often
involve duplication of effort
(and thus effectively a decrease
in teaching resources for the'
same financial outlay) with
no assurance of any increase
in teaching standards: a
decrease might be thought
likely.
It may be that under-
graduates would usually
prefer example and tutorial
classes, etc., to be taken by
members of staff rather than
postgraduates (qualification*
wise at least); however, it is
also the case that in many
departments students have
been pressing for such classes
to be made smaller in order,
to gain better attention to
individua: problems. ; These
are also calls for a move from
example to tutorial classes,
to achieve this would either
impose a heavier work-load on
the staff or necessitate the
employment of postgraduates.
Similarly, to prevent PGs from
demonstrating or tutoring
would lead to classes being
larger and the solution to your
problems even more remote
than at present.
