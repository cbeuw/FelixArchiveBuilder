FELIX SPORT
CROSS COUNTRY
On Saturday November 2nd the Cross-Country club made its
now annual tnpdown to Wye College for a three cornered match
between us, L S E and Wye followed as usual by a bonfire party
and piss-up. The course at Wye was shortened but still contained
its renowned exponentially rising hills as well as a ploughing
contest, little baa-lambs and
RUGBY
other sundry bits of nature.
Superstar Rob Allinson al-
though not going flat out came
first and broke the course
record (and didn't do a luggage
rack much good later on).
Steve Webb wasn't far outside
the old record either when he
came second. Ian E l l i s and
Granny Clarke also finished
high up the field to give IC a
comfortable win over L S E
followed by Wye who only
narrowly beat our second team.
The bonfire party was much
enjoyed hy all, thanks to some
real ale, although Ian
Isherwood fell over in a dip
that had been used as the
gents.
The following Wednesday
we had a tough fixture at
Sandhurst, which unfortunately
due to transport difficulties
(a cock-up) we were unable
to turn out our fullest team for.
After watching the array
warm up by numbers we set off
over the two lap course which
was very flat but had some
interesting features, e.g.
assult course, soldiers help-
fully pointing the way every
twenty yards (oops'.metres) and
a rather large stream. Rob
Allinson was again first back
in 25:35 in 3rd position. Ian
Ellis was 5th in 26:10 followed
ten seconds later by Steve
Webb, another ten second gap
saw Granny followed by a
large number of Sandhurst
runners and a few Irish guards
before Rich Harrington and
Pete Johnson came in 18th
and 19th. Due to this large gap
IC were beaten into second by
Sandhurst though we came a
long war)in front of the Irish
guards. A battle of the giants
between the last four in each
team was not unsupri singly
last by IC by a big margin.
The tea was as usual very
good afterwards though we
came away rather lacking in
souvenirs!
SOCCER C1UB
Our first four teams set out
last Wednesday on the long
and tedious journey up North
to Romford, there to do battle
with Queen Mary College. The
weather for once was ideally
suited to a decent game of
football and all four matches
had their share of thrills and
skills. Our 4th team fought
with great spirit and enthusiasm
for the full 90 minutes but
found the strength and some-
times underhand tactics of the
opposition too much for them,
eventually floundering 2-1. The
thirds also lost, going down
4-2 after leading 2-1 at half
time a result which must surely
indicate a lack of fitness
somewhere in the side. The
two success stories of the
day naturally come from the
first two teams. Our erratic
seconds turned on the heat
early on aad kept on top for
the rest of the game winning
convincingly 4-1. The firsts
in' a tough match came out on
top by the only goal even
though they had to really
extend themselves for a full
twenty minutes when fullback
D.Ansell went off with bad
nuts.
On Saturday the 1st round
of the London University Cups
was played and all our teams
were at Harlington. The only
shock of the day was the fact
that the 1st team were taken
into extra time by SCESS (who
are they?) but they finally
managed to stick one in (thank
God!) and so pass on to the
next round. Our seconds
casually strolled over our
fourths by an approximate
margin of eight goals helped
by the return of that demon full
back with two left legs R.KH1
(who's he?) and by an im-
pressive 4 goal tally by
M.Clark. The thirds lost 0-3
to Queen Mary seconds, let no
more be said about that, while
the fifth team gave us some-
thing to write home about by
defeating Birkbeck thirds by
the impossible margin of 4-1.
All in all not a bad Saturday's
sport — if all the coaches had
turned UP to take us home....
K.LIPSCOMBE
IC 1st entertained Harlequins *A' at Harlington on Saturday
and came out winners by 22-10. The day began with the routine
WAFU with coaches, several people being seated on the floor of
the bus on the way out. Not deterred by this the team turned out
only a few minutes late this week, and from the kick off the IC
forwards dominated the opp-
osition with Bradley playing
well. The first twenty minutes
of intense IC pressure saw
Harlequins 4-0 in front and it
was only when the IC pack
walked off for tea and biscuits
that the home supporters had
anything to cheer about.
D.Forbes kicked two very good
penalties to give IC a 6-4 lead
at half time. The teams
changed ends and IC were now
playing down the slope and
with the" wind, which at times
was quite strong. The IC pack
considered this an advant-
ageous time to return to the
game and sped back onto the
field. They continued to
dominate the scrums(11 arlequins
won about 2 in the whole of
the first half) and supplied the
backs with a good deal of ball.
It was in this half that the
exciting action took place.
From a scrum in front of the
Harlequins' posts the IC pack
stood up to see R.Hughes
standing back, do yet another
bad kick and miss with a drop-
goal attempt. Undeterred by
this failure Hughes shaped up
a similar attempt from another
set scrum a little later. The
ball seemed certain to miss
when a fluke gust of wind
blew the ball between the
sticks — the drop-goal race
was on! Ray (50 pounds lighter
this week) Hughes now con-
centrated his attention on the
try race. Bruce Bradley was
playing a blinder. IC won the
ball from a ruck and from a
brilliantly conceived move by
Lipscombe, Feam put Hughes
away on a simple 50 yard run.
to score a try with the ejsc
present Lipscombe at one
shoulder (and Anita on the
other). Dave Forbes converted
off a post. Bradley continued
to play well. Forbes slipped
in a penalty goal sometimes
and Harlequins scored a
mediocre try which was con-
verted. The scoring was
completed by another IC try.
The ball reached D.Shakesheff
on the wing (miracles!) and
after some neat interpassing
between himself and Bob
Stem the Frog dropped over
for a .try in the corner. Dave
Forbes missed a difficult
conversion. The game petered
out amidst the descending
gloom and rain. Bradley
continued to play well. The
final whistle went, the teams
hurried off for tea and biscuits.
The game marked the return
of Bo Bo Scutter in the centre
for the first time since his
encounter with Ruddoh Level-
bottom. Gerkin Phlegmbag ran
the line. Vocal support was
given by Mr. Astoneless of the
A's international squad, with
Bradley playing well.
Once again there was a
coach cock-up leaving 9 IC
men stranded. The journey
home was lightened however,
by carol singing at the Ariel
Hotel ably led by Mr. Ast-
oneless from the roof of the
bus-shelter. Mr. Flanagan
collected and Mr. Bradley
continued to sing well.
