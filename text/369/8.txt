WHEN THE Guilds have
a float in the Lord Mayor's
Show, they are facing some
pretty stiff competition.
They have to compete with
a huge sliced loaf on wheels
run by a bakery, a Gas corp
truck giving away free chips
and a twenty foot high
motorised fox:— a tribute
(?) by Cambridge University
to the incoming Lord Mayor
Sir Murray Fox.
Saturday tube travellers
were subjected to the sight
of a 6ft striped wooden
spanner accompanied by a
slightly smaller moron in a
straw hat apparently tra-
velling to the Lord Mayor's
Show with the rest of the
C Si G delegation.
And an hour later, there
it was: a dray of the Young's
Beer livery plastered with
shields representing the
educational authorities of
1474. Hot on its tail was a
lorry, adorned with: a tinfoil
satellite suspended on a bit
of string; a 'computer'; a
large brightly painted chim-
ney (?); and a piece of
machinery on a pedestal —
I don't understand these
things.
What C & G lost in visual
impact was made up for by
the sight of enthused guilds-
men leaping off the floats
and assulting the crowds
lining the streets with yells
of 'ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOURSELVES?' and 'IS
EVERYBODY HAPPY?'
only to be greeted with a
sea of blank stares, and the
occasional shout of 'YEEES'
from an old lady at the back.
The vehicles, positively
crawling with guildsmen,
chugged around the route
from Guildhall, via St,
Pauls, to the Royal Court
of Justice, where all in-
dulged in a free lunch before
the return march along the
Victoria Embankment.
The sight of a huge
cheering crowd sporting
Union Jacks all over is
strangely impressive, des-
pite the strong police
presence. A large part of
the force of 500 men were
dispensed unobtrusively
among the onlookers, most
of whom seemed to have a
good time.
