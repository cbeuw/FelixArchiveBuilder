Funding
Smoke Without Fire

Many postgraduate students will be
worse off financially because of a
decision by the Science and
Engineering Research Council
(SERC).
The Council, which funds many
postgraduate students, has altered
its student funding regulations. The
new rules make it impossible for
new postgraduates to claim daily
travel expenses. Also, current post-
graduates will also face drastic cuts
in the amount they are allowed to
claim as part of their funding. Some
students have been told of reduc-
tions of several hundred pounds in
the amount they will get.
SERC neglected to inform stu-
dents about the changes, leading to
financial problems for students who
had budgeted for themselves on the
basis of being able to claim more.
Many student organisations, includ-
ing Imperial College Union, have
voiced concern about the way the
changes have been brought in.
Information is being coordinated by
union advisers across the country
and an organised protest from some
source seems likely.
Minever Kavlak, the Union
Adviser, described the cuts as "a
national issue which affects every
college and many postgraduates".
Staff at S E R C have revealed
that they have been given a stan-
dard paragraph to read out in
answer to all enquiries about the
decision. The organisation has stat-
ed that the continuation of meeting
travel expenses is a "positive ges-
ture" on their part. A S E R C
spokesperson agreed that students
have been misled. She attributed it
to staff previously being wrongly
told that students who started
before October 1993 would be dealt
with under the old rules.

Imperial College has played host to
a full-scale fire simulation in co-
operation with the London Fire
Brigade.
The exercise, which took place
on Monday, involved the evacua-
tion of over four hundred students
and staff from the Royal School of
Mines (RSM). It was a joint initia-
tive between the College and the
Kensington, Chelsea and Fulham
Fire Brigades. The simulation was
intended both to allow the building
evacuation to be practiced and to
give the Fire Brigade an opportunity
to train in a realistic environment.
As part of the simulation, mock
casualties were placed in lifts and
top floor rooms and a smoke
machine was placed at the bottom
of one staircase in the Bessemer
building. The lighting was also shut
down to increase the realism of the
test. Additional College security
guards were on standby to deal with
any problems during the evacuation.
Fire-fighters from the three
Brigades donned breathing appara-
tus and communication equipment
before entering the building to res-
cue the 'casualties'. The Brigade
said it was "useful to have an exer-
cise that enabled fire-stations to
work together", something they are
rarely able to practice but are
expected to do in most large scale
fires.
The simulation was also
described as a good exercise in
communications with the Fire
Brigade's Control Unit (situated by
the Post Office on Exhibition Road)
as it was 'on call' throughout the
exercise.
Barry Holt, a Departmental
Safety Officer from the R S M and
original organiser of the event, said
the exercise was "realistic for us...
and them". He also described how
useful the exercise was in giving
"the Fire Brigade a good idea of the
layout of the building".
The Fire Brigade were reported
to have had slight difficulty with the
sheer amount of hose required to be
transported to the source of the
'fire'. The simulation also encoun-
tered a problem in that smoke in the
stairwells seemed to clear faster
than the organisers would have
liked.
It is hoped that another fire sim-
ulation will be staged in the future,
though it would be likely to take
place during a vacation to minimise
disruption to the College.
Software Challenge Competition
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Prizes to the value of Â£20,000 are
being offered in a competition for
young computer software designers.
Business Software Challenge '90s
is aimed at students in higher edu-
cation, as well as recent graduates,
working individually or in teams. It
challenges them to submit original
software designs - usually devel-
oped as coursework - to address
defined business problems.
Winning designs from the last
three years have ranged from a
small hotel management system to a
sea-bed profiler. The competition,
organised by the software company
Computer Associates Pic, has
helped designers to develop their
entries into commercial products.
The closing date for receipt of
entries is 2nd September 1994.

Tutor in the Department of
