Primal Scream
G/ve Owf But Don't
Give Up
An anecdote: at last summer's Glastonbury,
between madly binging on Verve, the
Lemonheads and unlikely and unsightly tuna
sandwiches, I'd find (blissed out) an enigmatic,
insistent sound emanating from the stage. The
stage crew moved like clockwork figures to a
technoish yet folkish backbeat that, to me,
recalls the summer festivals more than any
spliff, band or barbecue. The music was two
years late to these ears, was culled from
'Screamadelica' and the band were Primal
Scream. The unlikely promoters of dance...
What Primal Scream did, like the Stone
Roses before them, was produce music that
blended the Euphoric rush of rave with enough
rock-cred and attitude to convince committed
indie-lovers that you could cross over, if only for
a night. Pop down to a warehouse and pop those
Es. A n d with 'Give Out...' it's almost like
they're crossing back, a dove with an olive
branch, bringing their dance cronies to the world
of the Rolling Stones. I see Bobby Gillespie
(playing musical cookery - the last great wok
star?) get back from an all-nighter, whacked out,

Submarine
Submarine
Opening with 'I Can't Be Satisfied', it becomes
apparent that Submarine never submit to
complacency; despite knowing that conceit can
sometimes lubricate the mind and can ease
pressure. This refusal to be smug is perhaps the
basis of their creative impetus.
The trebly crunch of Neil Haydock's guitar
sprawls in all directions and lights the sky,
while the reverberating atmospherics of 'Alright
Sunshine Song' gives peripheral vision. In the
slower, sparser moments, they sound like
Codeine; but when they ignite they cut through
sheet metal.
A transient, unreal quality about them makes
them stand out; the unpredictable repeated
reprises of 'Lips and Fingers', for example, are
brilliant. While on the cover, a vision of a
family on the beach gives an almost apocalyptic
impression. The fruits if their work deserve
some attention; I hope they don't end up pissin'
in the wind.
Produced by Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev
producer Keith Cleversley, Submarine have all
the hallmarks of an American band. But they're
from London. Get yer cheesy grin around that
one. (7) Camille
with a few assorted clubbers and in the early
morning the discussion turns to idols; our Bob
says: "Well, 2 Unlimited are all very well lads
but I'll level - it's Mick and Keef that really
turned me on..." And then they get out their
instruments and prove it, play 'Exile on Main
Street' right there in the front room. The
clubbers gasp and want more and the Scream
nod sagely, remembering how much they made
on duty-free imports last crossover.
See, despite what the music press would have
you believe, 'Give Out...' is not the greatest 70s
record never made. It is, however, a great

Insides
Clear Skin
'Clear Skin' uses the ideas from the band's past
and takes them a few steps further. This is what
ambient music should be about - finely crafted
washes of sound, samples and instruments used
to create music that takes you out of your
mundane little life and transports you
somewhere... One track, 38 minutes. Most
bands wouldn't dare, most of those that did
would come up with no more than aural
candyfloss, only suitable for consumption with
large quantities of our favourite soft drug. 'Clear
Skin' needs no narcotic assistance to be
beautiful. It starts with a ripple of xylophone
and gradually builds up, piling on the guitars,
vocal loops, samples - including that old
chestnut, running water - until it all fuses,
breaks down and does it all again, only better.
The Insides are reclaiming ambient music
from the inept clutches of innumerable bilge
merchants. That they are gradually gaining
some sort of recognition from the mainstream is
to be welcomed with relief. We need music as
endlessly inventive, as otherworldly, as fresh as
this to remind ourselves that good music does
not begin with loud guitars and blistering
passion. (9) Ridley Dash
example of how retro music can mean
revolution. True, 'Jailbird' and 'Rocks' are
thundering leather clad beasts that'll have you
rushing for a Harley and a highway, anthemic
technicolour blasts of life, old Stones style. But
the title track, or the endlessly danceable
'Struttin', pay their dues to late eighties dance,
Massive Attack style rhythm soliloquies and
even their own 'Screamadelica'.
So, while Denise Johnson and George
Clinton add funky soul to songs that'll do fine
for my roadie backdrop this summer, it's
'Jailbird' that I'll be hitching to... (8) Owain

Next, Tori Amos was misquoted from 'Silent All These Years'. Pavement again from the 'Cut Your Hair' single. Then an oldie came with Janis .loplin's
'Me and Bobby McCce'. The Pumpkins' gave us 'Today' and the unknown Rose Chronicles a line from 'Nothing's Real'. We ended with the Mctiarriglcs and
'I).) Scrandc'. The Madder Rose quote is from 'Car Song.' Better luck next time kids...
