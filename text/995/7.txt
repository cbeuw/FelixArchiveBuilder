Feature
Pingu
£1.19
The packaging of this white chocolate egg is
aimed somewhere between toddlers and
Krypton Factor contestants. Despite the friendly
penguin pictures, the flimsy cardboard box
makes it difficult to open without ripping it.
The egg itself is made of white chocolate,
which is unfortunately "not as nice as a milky
bar". It breaks apart with a "rather satisfying
pop", revealing a small packet of dolly
mixtures, which were snapped up in a matter of
seconds. When questioned, the reviewers
responsible declared them to be "really nice".
Penguin, perhaps understandably, was a big
fan of this egg. For the price, the fun, sweets and
heated debate on the packaging, are hard to beat.

Poached Egg
Galaxy Truffle Eggs
£1.99
This isn't really a traditional egg: it's twenty
little sweets stuffed into a transparent tube. The
tube itself was mostly admired ("long, long,
long") and was noted for its reusability
(currently it is holding chopsticks).
The sweets themselves were chocolate truffle
ellipsoids with a hard centre. They were well
received ("the best tasting mini eggs I've had"),
if "quite rich." The panel also acknowledged
"we were strangely worried by the hard bits".
The truffles are not very good value: the
packet contained twenty eggs, working out at
lOp per egg. Not recommended, except for
practicality after the party.

Smarties Egg
£1.95
This egg looks extremely promising from the
outside - the "erm.. sturdy" box has a toy card
elephant on the back. A mild flurry of
excitement broke out among our reviewers at
the chance to "stick your fingers through an
elephant's bottom". (The idea is to use your
fingers as its legs.)
Sadly, that appears to be the best part of the
whole experience. The chocolate egg is "pretty
heavy" with a "stodgy, traditional" taste. It does
stick to your mouth, but was described as
"rough and ready - chocolate with stubble".
Whiskas would have hated it.
The worst part is the bag of smarties inside
the egg: is was terrible. A smartie connoisseur
described the contents as "sub-standard, smaller,
flatter, easier to bite through and with a different
texture to real smarties". Everyone agreed to
being disgusted.
We wouldn't recommend this egg, unless the
shop has run out of real smarties. To add to the
dilemma, this is a Nestte product, so you should
think twice before buying it.

Dairy Box
£4.29
This is the kind of egg you send to your mum. It
comes with a dainty cream bow on the front and
the egg is wrapped in flowery blue foil.
Less tactfully, the egg is quite fat, making it
"very good for spinning". The chocolate is
"thick and creamy", by far the best milk
chocolate we tested.
The sweets inside the egg are strangely
unmarked: those engaging in "culinary Russian
Roulette" will find standard Dairy Box fare very
nice but unexceptional.

Quality Street
£4.29
Fans of Dairy Box will be pleased to know that
the egg is seemingly identical. However, one
big difference is in the sweets: they are properly
packaged Quality Street favourites (fudge,
hazelnut & caramel, toffee, etc).
Another advantage is the packaging: the
more low-key approach ensures you won't lose
your street cred buying this one.
Overall, a better egg than Dairy Box.
Even Mr Bendy hated the sub-standard Smarties
Eggies (Mr Bendy)
£1.49
Mr Bendy (as he was christened) won our hearts
and minds immediately. As soon as we saw him
lying in a heap on the shelf, we just had to have
him. A transparent, egg-shaped being with pink
arms and legs that bend. And you even get some
chocolates inside. Brilliant.
The only problem was how to get at the little
sweets without damaging his torso. Eventually
we found a washing machine-like opening at the
back, cunningly concealed behind a sticker.
Unfortunately, the chocolates "look like animal
droppings wrapped up" and taste "buttery, very
nice", "alright in small quantities" or "like
cack."
Despite this, the quality of the sweets doesn't
seem to matter. To quote one of the reviewers:
"It's the bendy bits that count." We think that
Eggies show the way forward in confectionery.
One panelist suggested that "a foot tall Eggie
filled with Ferrero Rocher would be near
perfect".
For the present, though, "if you can feed the
chocolate to other people it's righteous".
