Equestrian Elections Science Week
William Waldegrave visits Imperial College earlier this week
Following the close of this year's
sabbatical elections, there is contro-
versy surrounding the way in which
they were run.
It seems certain that the secrecy
of the ballot has been broken with
the identity of a voter being con-
nected to one of their ballot papers.
The current voting process is
designed to make this impossible.
The ballot paper in question was
used at the close of voting after one
voting station had run out of papers
for one of the posts. The Returning
Officer, Andy Wensley, printed
more and verified the only one used
by signing it in ink. All other papers
had a photocopied signature.
According to the people count-
ing the votes in that particular ballot
box, the paper was queried due to
the difference in the signature. One
person said that Mr Wensley then
"definitely" identified the voter as
he certified that the paper was valid.
This has been backed up by other
people who were at the count.
In an interview with Felix, Mr
Wensley first denied the event, say-
ing the paper could not have been
identified: "It was a secret ballot.
Full stop." He later admitted that he
could have identified the paper,
saying: "I don't think it was [identi-
fied]." He added: "I must admit, it
wasn't a high point of the evening
- being asked 'is this a spoilt
paper?'."
One person present at the count
has alleged that he then revealed the
way in which the votes were cast on
the ballot paper.
Many people have questioned
whether President should be the
Returning Officer. M r Wensley
agreed that either a member of
Union staff or one of the Deputy
Presidents may be in a better posi-
tion to do the job.
Last Thursday's Schrodinger
Lecture by Nobel Laureate Max
Perutz revealed the workings of
haemoglobin, the 'breathing' mole-
cule.
Speaking to a packed Great Hall,
Dr Perutz explained how haemoglo-
bin transports oxygen around the
body with an animated film of it
'breathing' (changing its shape to
pick up and release oxygen).
"Haemoglobin is a moving
mechanism," he explained, "a mole-
Students have expressed concern
at the lack of publicity for New
Election. At the South Kensington
Hustings, New Election was only
mentioned by Mr Wensley at the
end, after having to be reminded.
Posters advertising the Hustings
were not put up until the day they
were due to take place. In his
defence, M r Wensley said the
posters were only "to remind
people". He also said that New
Election was publicised on a flyer
distributed around College.
Preliminary results from a sur-
vey carried out by Felix show that
only 5.6% of students interviewed
said they had read the flyer. This
may be attributable to it not being
sent to every eligible student as was
originally promised by Andy
Wensley. This was in spite of
address labels having been obtained
and people having offered to stick
them to the flyers well in advance
of them being sent out.
The survey also asked students
about what prompted them into vot-
ing. None of those interviewed
rated the flyer as their primary
influence, while over 15% cited
candidates' posters. This may indi-
cate that the major force behind this
year's record turnout was cam-
paigning by the candidates. The
survey ended by asking students
their opinion of the President and
how he is doing his job. Almost
half of those interviewed were
indifferent. A n equal percentage
(6%) of students described him as
"good" as called him a "a horse's
arse".
Perhaps ironically, Mr Wensley
said this year's election committee
intend to produce a document
advising on election matters for
future reference.
cular machine."
The Lecture, entitled 'Living
Molecules' was an overview of
research into the structure of DNA,
as well as Dr Perutz's own work on
haemoglobin. He illustrated his talk
with molecular models and even
demonstrated the extraction of
DNA using a kitchen blender!
Dr Perutz, who is still an active
researcher at 80, received the prize
for his work deciphering the struc-
ture of haemoglobin. He finished by

William Waldegrave, Science
Minister, visited Imperial College
this Tuesday to meet schoolgirls tak-
ing part in GETSET. The two day
event, part of National Science
Week, aimed to encourage more
women into science and engineering.
The G E T S E T projects were
based on the film 'Jurassic Park',
and over 300 girls, aged 13 and 14,
spent two days working in teams on
projects ranging from dinosaur res-
cue missions to taking a dinosaur's
'pulse'.
The challenges were designed by
CREST (Creativity in Science and
Technology) with the aid of chil-
dren's T V presenter Johnny Ball.
Female mentors from industry and
academia were on hand to provide
the girls with help and guidance in
solving the problems.
Mr Waldegrave, when awarding
prizes to the most innovative teams,
said: "So many people only think of
text-book bashing when they think
of science, but the young people
here today have shown an altogeth-
discussing the implications of
genetic engineering, including the
current trails of synthetic haemoglo-
bin, designed to reduce the risk of
AIDS. "If it works it will do away
with the risk of infection that blood
transfusion now carries," said Dr
Perutz.
The Schrbdinger Lectures are
held annually at Imperial College,
and previous lecturers have includ-
ed Stephen Hawking and Benoit
Mandelbrot.
er different side to science: the
exciting, innovative side which is
what science is like in the real
world."
During his visit, Mr Waldegrave
also saw some of the research car-
ried out at the College, such as
work using neurotoxins to treat
movement disorders by Professor
Oliver Dolly of the Biochemistry
Department. While there, he spoke
to some schoolgirls who were test-
ing 'dinosaur' blood as part of
G E T S E T . Simple biochemistry
experiments let the girls learn about
lab work and diagnostic tests. One
girl said she'd really enjoyed the
experiments, and "hadn't realised
science could be so much fun".
In an interview with Felix, Mr
Waldegrave stressed the importance
of events like GETSET in encour-
aging interest in science amongst
women. He said: "We are wasting
nearly half our population." He
went to say that the drive to get
more women in science and engi-
neering should not be a "one off
thing" but "has got to be long term
and it has got to be continuous".
Dismissed?
In issue 991 of Felix we stated that
Carolyne Osner was the Sports
Centre Manager at the time of its
refurbishment. We would like to
acknowledge that Pamela Thomas
was the Manager at the time and
Carolyne Osner was the College
Sports and Leisure Manager.
Currently, Pamela Thomas is
taking legal action against the
College for her alleged unfair dis-
missal in September 1993.
