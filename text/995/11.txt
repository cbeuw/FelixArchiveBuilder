How to do your 3D Crossword:
The principles are exactly the same as an ordinary cryptic crossword, but with
the addition to the normal across and down clues, of a set of through clues.
These only go in one direction, i.e. down through the levels (e.g. 10 to 2). For
your convenience, all of the squares with through words are shaded grey. We of
course highly recommend Chambers Dictionary, Thesaurus & Phrase file,
although Collins & Oxford dictionaries have also been referred to.

This Crossword is dedicated to Rose's soon-to-be-born baby in the hope that she'll
name him/her Felix, SphinX or Penguin. It is also dedicated to Rose herself who after

goes smoothly and wish both you and the baby well.
