Creepy and Curious at the Hunterian Museum
At a loss for what to do this weekend?
Unusually interested in the science of
life? Then why not take a trip to the
Hunterian Museum? Hidden away in-
side the Royal College of Surgeons in
Holborn, it is the ultimate destination
to explore all the gory details of animal
biology, and satisfy any morbid curi-
osities about surgery, disease and the
human body.
The Hunterian Museum has existed
in some form since way back in 1799,
and was originally made up of the
enormous and creepy collection of
the pioneering (that is, not medically
trained) surgeon John Hunter. Now
the exhibition comprises more than
3,500 diﬀerent anatomical and patho-
logical artefacts, from over 500 diﬀer-
ent species, from a 6 inch skeleton of
a human foetus to an exceedingly long
pig epididymis. Highlights in-
clude the 7ft 7 skel-
eton of ‘Irish
Giant’ Charles
Byrne (who
rather upset-
tingly asked in his
will to be buried at
sea, speciﬁcally so
that he wouldn’t end
up in a museum), and
the bound foot bones
of a Chinese concubine
— gruesome enough to
make any modern wom-
an feel bad complaining
about high heels. It’s also
worth looking out for the
preserved human faces,
complete with rosy cheeks,
eyelashes and smiling open mouths —
if only so you can avoid them, if you’re
the squeamish type!
Meanwhile animals of all shapes
and sizes are sliced up and preserved
in formaldehyde, their jars covering
the walls like some kind of scientiﬁc,
overwhelming Damien Hirst exhibi-
tion. Pregnant rats and giant scorpi-
ons cosy up next to tiny tadpoles and
unrecognisable prehistoric starﬁsh, in
a kind of fascinating, terrifying dis-
play of the intricacy and diversity of
the animal world.
Even more fascinating are the
famous ‘Evelyn Tables’, which,
dating from around 1640, are
thought to be the oldest ana-
tomical preparations in Eu-
rope. On four wooden boards,
the ridiculously complex and
intricate patterns of nerves,
veins and arteries that run
through the human body
have somehow been dis-
sected, dyed and glued
“”
The ultimate
destination to
explore all the
gory details of
animal biology
down with complete biological accu-
racy, using techniques that modern
surgeons still aren’t sure of.
The museum also houses a small col-
lection of unusual paintings from the
19th century, with subjects as diverse
as Siamese twins and dwarf soldiers,
representing British scientists’ and
artists’ innate curiosity with the most
remarkable and, at the time, most in-
explicable of human ailments. Mean-
while upstairs, a terrifyingly detailed
exhibition on diﬀerent surgery tech-
niques is captivating and disgusting in
equal measures, with enough strange
looking surgical instruments on dis-
play to make the stomach churn. The
interactive parts, especially, are not
for the faint-hearted, but are a must-
see for anyone who’s ever wanted to
have a quick go at keyhole surgery!
Thanks to a £3 million refurbish-
ment a few years back the exhibition
is beautifully presented, and it doesn’t
quite feel like you’re exploring some
creepy biologist’s basement. So have
a hearty meal, and go and visit — as
long as you stay conscious, you won’t
regret it!
The Hunterian Museum, Lincoln’s Inn
Fields, open Tuesday-Saturday 10am-
5pm.

Astronomers analysing data from the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas have
spotted an enormous black hole — but
in a relatively miniscule galaxy.
Most galaxies, such as our own
Milky Way, are thought to have a su-
per-massive black hole at their centre.
Current theories suggest that the two
grow in tandem, and so, across space,
black hole masses are usually roughly
proportional in size to their host gal-
axies.
But not so with this galaxy, NGC
1277. Where normally the central
black hole has a mass of around one
thousandth the mass of the host gal-
axy, NGC 1277 appears to be harbour-
ing one with a relative mass of a whop-
ping 14%. That works out at around 17
billion times the mass of the Sun, and
is big for any galaxy, let alone this tiny
one!
A report in Nature explains how the
team, led by Remco van den Bosch at
the Max Planck Institute in Germany,
calculated this mass by looking at the
velocity dispersion of the stars moving
in the black hole’s ‘sphere of inﬂuence’.
By chance the galaxy also appeared in
some high-resolution images taken by
the Hubble Space Telescope, and the
combined data clearly showed that the
inner stars were orbiting extremely
fast — suggesting an extremely dense
concentration of mass at the galaxy’s

black hole ended up in this little gal-
axy, just a quarter the size of the Milky
Way. Initially the team looked for
signs that a larger galaxy somewhere
close by was ‘tidally stripping’ NGC
1277, drawing out and eating away at
its stars and gases. But NGC 1277’s
near-perfect ﬂat, disc-like shape rules
that out, and means it can’t be a super-
position of two diﬀerent galaxies that
the astronomers are looking at, either.
What’s even weirder is that the same
data also shows ﬁve possible other
candidates apparently displaying the
same odd phenomenon. This sug-
gests NGC 1277 may not be just some
astronomical ﬂuke, but actually the
beginnings of evidence that current
theories of black hole and galaxy evo-
lution need to be rewritten.
