Fear of Fiction Festival
Lily Leheadswest,clingingtothefestivaldream
The only magazine to focus on Bris-
tol’s music scene threw a giant street
party before winter started to settle in
and thwart all endeavours of extending
the festival season. Of course, Felix was
invited. Set along Stokes Croft - which
could be deemed a mini ‘Hoxditch’ of
Bristol - bars, cafés, and cinemas show-
cased exciting up-and-coming artists.
DZ Deathrays,
Motorcycle Showrooms
No, I don’t know what DZ stands for,
and frankly I don’t really care. Watch-
ing the music video to The Mess Up
in which the two members consume a
bottle of Jeigermeister in three minutes,
was enough to persuade me to go and
catch them. Although not the biggest
fan of any kind of remotely guitar-heavy
music, the Deathrays’ set was surpris-
ingly very enjoyable. Full of energy,
noise, sweat and crowdsurﬁng, it was a
funcontrasttothepreviousbands’more
conserved playlists. What was really en-
joyable was that their aural tantrum was
reﬁned by a melodious, charming angle;
and the singer stood in the middle of the
danceﬂoor for a whole track (plenty of
time for unavoidable touching).
Oliver Wilde,
the Cube Cinema
Hidden amongst a housing es-
tate, the Cube Cinema was a cute
little venue well-suited to the cute
little sounds of Oliver Wilde. A
groovy (hate to use that word, but
it was actually groovy) bass accom-
panied a drummer with a Darwin
Deez-like Movember, violin player,
and soft distorted vocals to recre-
ate what music would sound like if
it had been channelled through an
aural Instagram app before being chan-
nelled through your ears. Their softened
DIIV in The Garage
Zachary Cole Smith is the guitarist for
lo-ﬁ surf rock outﬁt Beach Fossils,
whose band-members are currently oﬀ
pursuing their own side-projects. For
Smith, his eﬀorts have coalesced into
DIIV (said ‘Dive’), with the debut al-
bum Oshin coming out earlier this year.
From these names, you get no points
for guessing that DIIV’s music is still
very much awash with that seaside
sound, but the album also includes
some more sophisticated guitar play-
ing and elements of shoegaze and
psychedelia. Described as “one part
THC, two parts MDMA”, Oshin was a
gorgeous, dreamy debut record, a deﬁ-
nite soundtrack to my summer.
Conversely, they decided to bring the
tour to the UK as winter began to sink
in around us, playing a smattering of
headline dates and providing support
to the (vastly inferior) Vaccines. This
quick dash around the country includ-
ed one brief stop in London, a sell-out
headline date at the Relentless Garage
in Islington.
Support came in the form of Al-
dous R.H, in fact another side-project
fronted by Manchester native Alex
Hewitt of Egyptian Hip Hop fame.
A heady mix of psychedelic guitars
and delay-soaked vocals, their sound
swung from sounding like Tame Im-
pala slowed down to getting lost in
a droney cover of an Arthur Russell
song that left the crowd somewhat
disorientated. Though I’d been tipped
about them before, their set was pleas-
antly surprising; it says a lot that they
managed to pull quite a crowd away
from the bars. Sadly, the same couldn’t
be said about the other support band

DZ Deathrays
Britpop sound was a sweet
way to start oﬀ the festival,
but the repeated camera roll
of a girl prancing up and
down a green hill behind
them got annoyingly labori-
ous after a few songs.
Labyrinth Ear,
Lakota
Labyrinth Ear was the
main attraction that drew us to the
festival. Although they played in one
of those annoying venues where it’s so
cold that you have to keep your coat on
and it’s too uncomfortable to drink any-
thing except hot chocolate, this didn’t at
all ruin the experience of watching this
interesting new two-piece. Kicking oﬀ
with their most, understatedly, erotic
Labyrinth Ear
track and personal favourite ‘Amber’
was enough to turn a ﬁve person audi-
ence into a three-quarters full dance
ﬂoor. Not even the extreme shyness
of the endearing elﬁn-like singer who
seemed to refuse to look at anything ex-
cept the ﬂoor or her fellow band mem-
ber could disturb the crowd’s level of
engagement. It is a shame that they have
come onto the scene amongst a burst of
male/female electronic acts of the mo-
ment, being overshadowed by artists
such as Crystal Castles, the XX, and
Purity Ring; it is understandable why
they may be dismissed and tossed onto
Parakeet, who
ﬁt with the
slow-burning
grunge/garage-
rock revival
that I can’t re-
ally get into.
But if Al-
dous seemed
to have drawn
a good crowd,
it was noth-
ing compared
to the turn-out
for DIIV them-
selves; the ven-
ue was packed
the pile. However, even if the aesthetics
of their sound are not obviously unique,
the eﬀect of their music is underrated
and yet unparalleled by such acts as the
above; demonstrated by their closing
piece ‘Humble Bones’
, which somehow
manages to recreate that excited but
intimidating feeling which drowns you
around the people you fancy in a non-
cheesy dance ﬂoor track.
TOY,
Motorcycle Showrooms
TOY was deﬁnitely the least im-
pressive band of all the ones we
managed to catch at the festival. In
this case their aural tan-
trum was not reﬁned by
anything except a very
whiney and painful key-
board which seemed to
be played by bashing the keys
and then holding the chords
for minutes on end. What-
ever the singer was trying to
get out of his mouth was not
audible, and their lack of au-
dience engagement was not
at all endearing as was the
case for Labyrinth Ear. Their
just-yanked-out of the seventies look
was not going for them. The whole thing
was a shambles. Nevertheless, there was
something charming about their set:
probably the knowledge that their stu-
dio recordings are decent but were just
played in a very poor way. Many bands
are the same, and many artists need to
learn that playing unenthusiastically
does not equate to being cool. They are
a band that have potential, and whom
I would see again in the hope that they
would get their act together and actually
play well.
Fear of Fiction festival is a new festi-
val held in Bristol highlighting the best
in new, undiscovered music. Organised
by the labels, magazines and shops that
make the Bristol music scene tick, there’s
no better way into the local scene.
almost wall to wall and quickly became
uncomfortably hot, and this wasn’t
helped by what happened once the
band got on stage. After beginning with
the soothing melodies of album open-
er ‘Druun’, Smith and his bandmates
suddenly launched into the next track
‘Past Lives’ in double time, thrashing
out the riﬀs in a way that was impres-
sive but utterly unexpected. The front
of the crowd went mad, but I was left
bemused.
And they continued in this way for
the rest of the show, playing every
song at twice the tempo and throw-
ing in solos and jams that warped the
aesthetic completely. The tracks were
familiar, and every now and then an
oasis of calm seemed to form as a fa-
miliar melody took hold, only to be
interrupted but an inexplicable ﬂurry
of notes. It was all frantic, more dude
rock than shoegaze. Escaping to the
back of the room for fear of melting
and looking around at the crowd, it
seemed I wasn’t the only one who’d
be caught oﬀ-guard; DIIV were tech-
nically brilliant, no doubt, but this
wasn’t what I’d expected to see.
