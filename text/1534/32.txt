Models bring sexy back
Maya Kaushik interviews Anita from Britain and Ireland’s Next Top Model
his summer, cycle 8 of
Britain and Ireland’s
Next Top Model aired
on Sky Living, fea-
turing many exciting
challenges and photo shoots, includ-
ing a shoot with tarantulas, walking
on CN tower, and posing with na-
ked male models. During the series,
twenty contestants were whittled
down to one winner. Anita Kaushik
was the contestant labelled as the
dark horse of the competition, start-
ing oﬀ weakly but improving rapidly
every week, gaining approval from
the judges, and ﬁnally reaching the
ﬁnal episode, coming third place. I
spoke to Anita to ﬁnd out her views
on the competition, modelling and
the fashion world.
Maya Kaushik: Hi Anita. How has
it been for you, going from being
relatively unknown to being viewed
by many people from their living
rooms every Monday night?
Anita Kaushik: Hi! It’s been absolute-
ly crazy, from just being a girl from
Southampton that no one knows to
getting recognised in Tesco’s and on
nights out and people wanting pic-
tures! I love it though, shows how
dedicated the fans of the show are
and if it wasn’t for them I’d have no
support!
MK: How much contact have you
had with the other BINTM contest-
ants since the show?
AK: I still speak to most of the girls
from the show and still see the ones
that live in and around London. Lisa
and I still keep in contact Skyping
regularly! I’m in the process of trying
to persuade her to move to England!
MK: Who was your favourite and
least favourite judge on the show
and why?
AK: I think my favourite judge had to
be Tyson. He was always really sup-
portive of me and seemed to have my
back right from the start even when
the other judges might have not be-
lieved in me. I really liked Julien as
well; he always put a smile on my
face. I wouldn’t say I disliked any of
the judges because they all brought
something diﬀerent to the panel, but
I think out of all of them I had the
least support from Whitney. Not that
she didn’t like me, I just think she was
indiﬀerent as to whether I was in the
competition or not.
MK: Would you say you have a
particular fashion style, and what
made you choose it?
AK: I wouldn’t say I have a particular
style but I like to think I keep up with
fashion styles. I sometimes wish I was
a bit more adventurous with trying
out diﬀerent styles but I will always
make an eﬀort because it makes me
feel good when I think I look good!
MK: To any aspiring models out
there, have you learnt any tips in
modelling technique that could
come in handy?
AK: The best piece of advice that Elle
told one of the other girls was to al-
ways believe in yourself. If you went
up to them in the elimination room
looking defeated then the judges had
really no reason to keep you in the
competition. And if you say you don’t
like your picture, how can you expect
anyone else to like it? So the best tip
I can give is to always be conﬁdent,
because in this industry it’s better to
be over-conﬁdent and for people to
believe in you than to be under-con-
The end of term is nearly here and
with it my last Top 5 Episodes feature
of the year. This week saw a return to
the old favourites, making me realize
that I really need to start watching
some new shows.
Next term, look out for reviews
on Dexter, South Park, Fringe, Twin
Peaks, Grey’s Anatomy and many
more, as we can also look forward to
the new season of Game of Thrones,
Girls and True Blood on HBO. Have
a great holiday, watch lots of TV and
let everyone know what you liked or
disliked!

ﬁdent and for people to not want to
give you a chance.
MK: What would you say are the
best and worst aspects of the mod-
elling and fashion industries?
AK: The best thing is you never know
where you’re going to be and what
you’re going to be doing in the future.
This industry is so diﬀerent to any-
thing else and I love the fact that now
that I’m full time modelling, I never
Lucia Podhorska Television Editor
know what my schedule is week to
week so it never gets boring! I think
the worst aspect is there is a lot of
rejection. People who aren’t sure of
themselves and take criticism to heart
shouldn’t be in the industry because
you will always face it. But then you
just have to think, even Kate, Giselle
and Adriana would have come across
some kind of rejection in their life!
And even though there is rejection,
when you get jobs and people request
you for jobs it’s the best feeling!
