FRIDAY 07 DECEMBER
17
Nativity! This is
British comedy
based around a
primary school
nativity play. Largely impro-
vised and low budget, this
film is warm, jolly and non-
commercial, and the child ac-
tors are brilliant. Plus there
are some really catchy songs!
16
Home Alone
I and II: prob-
ably my favour-
ite holiday films.
Culkin plays Kevin, a super
cute kid accidently and con-
tinuously left home alone.
Burglars try to break into the
home, but he fights them off
like a ninja. Hilariously funny.
18
The Grinch: every-
one knows one, but
Jim Carrey does it
best in this fantasy
film based on the famous Dr Suess
book. The inhabitants of Whoville
are victims of the Grinch's Christ-
mas stealing ways, but it takes the
loveofonesmallchildtoremindeve-
ryonewhattheseasonisreallyabout.
21
The Nation-
al Lampoons
Christmas Va-
cation: another
favourite of mine. Riotously
funny, this slapstick comedy
encompasses everything won-
derful about the season: family
arguments, mishaps, cooking
disasters, but most importantly,
community and good humour.
22
White Christmas:
Bing Crosby and
his fellow soldier
and partner in a
successful song and dance duo fall
in love with a sister act, and team
up to help the duo's ex-Army Gen-
eral save the failing Vermont Inn
fromclosure.Plentyofcomedyand
somegreatmusicalnumbers make
this a perfect Christmas film.
25
It's a Wonderful Life: this is widely thought of as the most essential Christmas film ever made,
and it isn't hard to see why. A frustrated businessman is visited by an angel, who shows him what
life would be like if he had never been born. He sees that the people he loves would have been mis-
erable or dead, and realises that his life has had a positive influence on the world. Not only a great

23
The Snowman:
Another Raymond
Briggs animation,
this is a classic film
that should be in everyone's essen-
tial viewing list. If this film doesn't
pull at the heartstrings, then your
heart must be made of ice too. A
youngboymakesasnowman,who
takes him on a magical journey.
24
Nightmare Be-
fore Christmas:
Tim Burton's
stop-motion
musical horror film is a cred-
ible alternative to all the fes-
tive schmaltz before the big
day arrives. The ing of Hallow-
eentown discovers Christmas-
town, and tries to usurp Santa.
19
Love Actually:
Severallovestories
are interwoven in
this hugely popu-
lar rom-com. Love Actually has a
kick-asscast,includingBillNighy,
Alan Rickman, Emma Thomp-
son, Hugh Grant and Martine
McCutcheon, a great soundtrack
and happy-endings all round.
20
Father Christmas:
this little known
Raymond Briggs
film is chronically
underappreciated. This charming
animation documents what Santa
does with the parts of the year not
spent gearing up for Christmas,
and has some overlap with the
morewidelyknownTheSnowman.
happy, but these films will...
e it hard to get in the mood. We've come up with a film for every day of Advent â€“ call it an early Christmas present...
