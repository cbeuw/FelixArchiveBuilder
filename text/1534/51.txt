The Mayor knew the types of the two pas-
sers-by, but didn’t know who was who, so
theywereofdifferenttypes.Theonlypossi-
blecombinationswhichdon’tleadtoacon-
tradiction are (Knight, Tourist), (Tourist,
Knight), (Knave, Knight), (Tourist, Knave).
Now, the Mayor must have answered “yes”
when I asked him if knowing whether he
figued out who was who would help me
solve the puzzle (since I did solve it). If he
could figure it out, then we can rule out the
Knight-Tourist combination, and we can’t
solve it, so the Mayor must have not been
able to figure out who was who, and we
find that the two fellows are a Knight and a
Tourist,althoughwecan’tknowwho’swho.
