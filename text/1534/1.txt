Any keen eyed students who were at
Imperial last year will deﬁnitely notice
the diﬀerences around campus, spe-
ciﬁcally the Mechanical Engineering
Building. This is not a simple reclad-
ding to revamp the building’s look. It is
in fact part of a major redevelopment
of building on the South Kensington
campus. Steve Howe, Director of Capi-
tal Projects and Planning, has said that
what you see is just the “tip of the ice-
berg” describing the plans as a “huge
project”
.
The multi million pound project,
believed to be costing roughly £39m,
has been termed the Aeronautical Me-
chanical Engineering Project (AMP).
It will be performed over a number of
years, meaning some changes may not
even be seen by the current cohort of
ﬁrst year students.
