40 FRIDAY 07 DECEMBER
Best Actor:
Joaquin Phoenix
The Master
Wide-eyed, hunched over
and completely disturbed and
damagedtotheverycore,Phoenix
is bang on in the middle of Paul
Thomas Anderson’s incredibly
challenging, dense drama. His
extremely volatile nature is a
tour-de-force of a performance,
one that grabs your attention
from the get-go and holds on
despite the difficult turns and
developments Anderson often
presents.
Best Actress:
Marion Cotillard
Rust and Bone
As a killer-whale trainer who
goes through a horriﬁc accident,
Cotillard’s nuanced, carefully
measured performance is a thing
of wonder as she ﬁercely dives
into the complex persona of a
double leg amputee faced with
the many challenges of everyday
life. Both inspirational and
emotionally devastating, this is
yet another showcase for this
outstanding French actress who
pushes the boundaries.
Best Supporting Actor:
Matthew McConaughey
Magic Mike
No-one does sleazy, greasy and
sneaky as well as McConaughey
can, which is why he is the perfect
ﬁt for his male strip club owner
act. With his thick Southern
accent, sly slinky moves, cheeky
conﬁdence and sly grin to top it
all off, he is the comic highlight of
the ﬁlm, whilst also wisely never
underplaying the “antagonist”
aspect of his outstanding role that
simply outclasses his many other
co-stars.
Best Supporting Actress:
Helena Bonham Carter
Great Expectations
In a role that seems to have
been written speciﬁcally for
this English actress even before
she was born, Carter excels in
occupying the role of one of
literature’s most famous jilted
brides, Miss Havisham. Adding
enough kooky craziness in her
creepy wedding dress whilst also
revealing a subtle touch of stirring
humanity, she is the most fun, but
also tragic part of an otherwise
dull and dry ﬁlm.
Best Director:
Gary Ross
The Hunger Games
Turning a popular franchise of
novelsaimedatteenagers,making
it as potent and meaningful to the
adults is a difficult task, but Ross
wascertainlyupforthechallenge.
With his intimate, up-close, shaky
camerawork injecting plenty of
realism and suspense into the
futuristic thriller, it’s no wonder
this became such an unexpected
hit with a wide demographic.
Shame he’s not involved in the
many sequels to come.
Rising Star of the Year:
Jeremy Irvine
He was hand-picked by Steven
Spielberg to take part in his
World War I epic War Horse
and his success didn’t end there:
with lead starring roles in Now
is Good, and Great Expectations,
this young English talent appears
to stand a good chance in making
it big in this tough business, with
Spielberg calling him the new
Christian Bale. Up next is The
Railway Children, where he will
stand alongside Oscar winners
Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman.
Ensemble of the Year:
The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup (and Dev
Patel... sure, he can get in on this list) – a cast list doesn’t read better than this. And despite the choppy direction
and unsure narrative that prevented this from becoming a mediocre crowd-pleaser, the English legends help sell
the story. It’s no surprise to see this turned out to be the sleeper hit of this summer.
Rising Star of the Year:
Elizabeth Olsen
No longer having to live in her
older twin sisters’ shadow, Olsen
has become a movie star in her
own right. What started this off
was her unforgettable debut
performance in the brilliantly
ambiguous Martha Marcy
May Marlene and she has since
followed that up with equally
memorable supporting turns
in Silent House, Red Lights, and
Liberal Arts. She has also been
cast in the Hollywood remake of
South Korea’s Oldboy.
