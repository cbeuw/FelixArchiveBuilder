Just... one... more... Draw a single closed loop by joining the
dots (no diagonals!) so that the numbered squares are sur-
rounded by the corresponding number of lines.
Okay guys, I swear this is the last new puzzle for quite
a while, and I’m totally not putting it here to ﬁll space
or anything. The idea is to ﬁll the squares with digits
from 1-9 (using each one only once) so that the num-
bers in the circles are equal to the sum of the four
surrounding squares and that each coloured set of
squares sums to the corresponding number.
Fill the cells with a con-
tinuous line that enters and
exits at the shown points,
does not pass through a cell
twice and passes through
all white boxes. The num-
bers show you how many
times the “snake” turns in
a given row or column, and
the arrows show you where
it enters and leaves the grid.
It’s just like a nonogram, ex-
cept it’s not.
During the insanity epidemic, insane knights were admitted to the island’s insane asylum,
populated by doctors and inmates (all of which are knights). Knights are honest, so sane
knights tell the truth, but insane knights believe false statements, so they honestly lie!
Inspector Craig visited the asylum once. He was greeted by the head doctor. “We’ve lined
up all the patients and the doctors in a 99-person line. They will be happy to answer any
questions.” Craig walked up to the ﬁrst man in line and asked him, “Who is insane here?” “I
believe he is sane!” he said, pointing at the head doctor. Craig went on to the second man
in line and asked the same question. “I believe that I believe that the man in front of me is
offhisgourd!”heexclaimed.Craigcontinuedwiththethirdman,askingthesamequestion.
“Why, I believe that I believe that I believe that the man in front of me is just a bit mad.”
The investigation continued in the same vein, as each man accused the man in front of him
of being insane, but adding another “I believe that” in front, resulting in some rather long
statements. In addition to that, the penultimate man also claimed that the man behind him
wasinsane.Craigthoughtforabit.Heaskedthehead,“Whoisadoctorandwhoisapatient
here?” “Oh”, the doctor replied, “the man you asked ﬁrst is a patient, and the second man
wasadoctor,anditjustalternatedfromthere.”Justthen,Craigrealisedsomethinghorrible.

Connect all the islands
with bridges so that you
can get from any island
to any other one. There
are restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must not
intersect. You can have
up to two bridges be-
tween any two islands
and, last but not least,
each island must have
exactly as many bridges
as the number on it
states.
