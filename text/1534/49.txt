This week an angel comes
down from heaven to tell you
that you’re expecting a royal
baby. However, you have
such severe morning sick-
ness that you throw it up pre-
maturely. Giving birth out of
your mouth knocks all your
teeth out, so you are stuck
with dentures for the rest of
your life. Congratulations!
This week you run into your
crush underneath some mis-
tletoe. This is the opportunity
you’ve been waiting for! You
go for it and enjoy a pas-
sionate embrace, and god it
feels good! You tenderly step
back to check this is real, but
it’s actually your supervisor
standing disgusted in front
of you.
This week you have a deli-
cious Christmas dinner with
your housemates, and even
manage not to burn anything.
However, you eat so much
that you fall into a food coma.
When you wake up 3 days
later, you have grown sprouts
from your ears and can
only communicate through
strange clucking noises.
This week you receive an
early Christmas present from
your significant other half. You
open it, trembling in anticipa-
tion. The gift is some expen-
sive underwear, but it’s five
sizes too big… They mum-
ble something about it being
meant for ‘the other one’; I
think there’s something they
might not be telling you…
This week you buy a festive
themed wank sock, also
known as a stocking. You
diligently add ‘presents’ to
it daily until Christmas day
and give it to your chosen
recipient. They ask for a
clue as to what could be in-
side; you respond that it’s a
lucky dip... They aren’t ex-
actly grateful.
This week you embark on a
long journey to your birth-
place on a donkey. But you
get lonely along the way
and decide to get friendly
with it. While you’re reliev-
ing your loneliness, it kicks
you in the face and runs off,
leaving you stranded in the
barren wilderness of TFL
zone 9.
This week you are so cold
that you consume a large
amount of anti-freeze to keep
your blood from freezing. As
your insides slowly dissolve
and you burn from inside out,
you reflect that at least it is
the faster and warmer way to
die. In hindsight though, you
probably should have just
turned the heating on.
This week you have 100
coursework deadlines tomor-
row and have only completed
one of them so far. You’re even
worse off than Jay-Z because
you have 99 problems (sheets)
but you don’t have any bitches
either. You won’t make a good
scientist or a good gangsta;
you should probably practise
flipping burgers.
This week Santa comes to
visit! You can’t believe he’s
actually real and hasten to
offer him a mince pie and
mulled wine. Turns out he’s
really a burglar and steals
your MacBook, iPhone, TV,
AND toastie maker. The only
present he leaves is a shit on
your carpet. Happy Christ-
mas!
This week Venus is in its 4th
house and Mars is bright,
which means that you’re going
to be savaged by a stray wolf
and get rejected from all your
job applications. At least you
can blame the stars for the fact
that you are still unemployed,
and use it as an excuse to go
travelling until the economic cli-
mate improves i.e. indefinitely.
This week you go carol singing
forcharityandshatbyaccident.
Every note you sing makes the
acute squelchy sensation in
your pants more uncomfortable
and shaking your collecting tin
agitates the warm goo, mak-
ing it trickle down your trouser
leg. Eventually it leaks into your
shoe and you call it a day, hav-
ing collected about 20p.
This week, you have to choose
between moisturising with gra-
vy or eating 100 leftover brussel
sprouts for breakfast until Christ-
mas. On the one hand, gravy
could be quite beneficial to your
skin being nutrient-rich, while
sprouts make you fart. On the
other hand, it would be cold and
slimy, and sprouts are healthy
too. What’s it going to be?
