Students Projects given Chance to Shine
Giri Kesavan shares highlights from Imperial’s first ever CSR conference
hink social responsibility
and you don’t normally
think of banks. Discov-
ering social enterprise,
learning business skills,
pitching for sponsorship and inspir-
ing volunteering were just some of
the themes explored in the Imperial
College Finance Society (ICFS) led
Corporate Citizenship conference
on Wednesday. A pilot event for the
society and run in collaboration with
Imperial Hub & The Student Led
Projects symposium, the conference
brought together senior business
leaders from investment banks, start
up social entrepreneurs and student
projects – with a series of speeches,
workshops and a sponsorship pitch-
ing session with £750 up for grabs.
Sponsorship isn’t as simple as writ-
ing a document, emailing a ﬁrm and
getting money for projects and soci-
eties. Students nationwide learned
about the unique approaches and
strategies used by ICFS in develop-
ing and maintaining extraordinarily
close partnerships with over 33 ﬁrms
– the key themes being professional-
ism without elitism, a small exec com-
mittee with tight sponsorship control,
accountability and of course informal-
ity – when in doubt, make a cool You-
Tube video! Projects had the chance
to hear from ICFS sponsors such as
Nomura on why they support the so-
ciety and the key takeaway message: If
you want funding for a student-pro-
ject – don’t act like a student but act
like a corporate!
With keynote presentations from
Nomura and Ernst & Young, stu-
dents witnessed ﬁrst-hand the kind of
CSR projects such ﬁrms fund – from
the Rainbow Trust to EY’s extensive
portfolio of social enterprises. The
Rainbow Trust mentioned how they
were successful in becoming the char-
ity partner for Nomura and raising
£500,000 in just a year – just through
employee engagement and matched
giving (where the ﬁrm matches any
donation made by an employee to a
charity). Following this, students had
the exclusive chance to listen to the
UK Head of Corporate Citizenship
at Ernst & Young – who highlighted
key projects in entrepreneurship, ed-
ucation & environment totalling £5.1
million of UK sponsorship in the past
year.
The highlight of the speeches was
undoubtedly John Grisby, a social
entrepreneur who co-founded DNA
Performance – an organisation aimed
at ﬁnding and educating the next gen-
eration of business leaders for CSR
style projects. In John’s landmark
speech – he touched on the issue of
“self-awareness” – you might think
you’re a pro – but your sponsors may
not! Reviewing, reﬂecting and adapt-
ing your team to drive sustained per-
formance is key to securing long-term
investment and sponsorship. It’s as
much about emotional intelligence
as it is about having competitive and
unique technical skills.
Sound words of advice indeed. Fol-
lowing the presentations, projects
had the chance to network and pre-
pare for their sponsorship pitches
in workshops run by Stuart Arnott
(Mindings) and Rhiannon Horsley
(from our very own Imperial Hub) on
writing business plans in a 9-fold con-
cept as well as the critical attributes
of emotion, conveying a story, suc-
cinctness and passion in pitches for
sponsorship. With over 10 projects
vying for £750 worth of sponsorship
– these workshops gave them valuable
feedback on their business plans and
existing proposals – preparing them
for the main event: The Sponsorship
Pitching competition.
With £750 of ICFS Sponsorship up
for grabs in a competition with 10
strong student-led projects from Im-
perial College, Loughborough Uni-
versity, UCL & Liverpool University
– the high stakes pitching challenge
was the highlight of the day. Judged by
business representatives from Inside
Buzz, John Grisby, Stuart Arnott and
Rhiannon Horsley, projects had just
three minutes to covey their ideas,
hopes, dreams and ambitions to our
panel – with immediate feedback.
From societies to social enterprises,
each pitch was unique and it was up to
the judges to answer the critical ques-
tion: Who should we invest in Who
has what it takes to stand up and do
a pitch?
The Imperial College El Salvador
project (working on critical construc-
tion projects overseas) left the judges
impressed with their quick-ﬁre ability
to turn an engineering project into a
viable social enterprise proposition
– walking away with the top prize of
£500. The Kenyan Orphan project –
supporting health, welfare and educa-
tion in Kenya – similarly impressed
with their personal and passionate
pitch; winning £250 of sponsorship.
Many congratulations not only to the
winning projects but to all 10 who
pitched on the day – they all received
valuable feedback from sponsorship
pitching veterans and no doubt this
will help in the future!
Student Hubs’ CEO Adam O’Boyle
closed the conference with an eye-
opening speech into the foundation
and impact of Student Hubs – the
umbrella organisation behind Imperi-
al Hub this year. With numerous ways
to get involved whatever your volun-
teering aspirations – projects learned
how they could take it to the next level
with the opportunities from Imperial
Hub. It was a fantastic end to a highly
successful pilot event for the ICFS;
the ﬁrst event of this kind organised
by any ﬁnance society in the country!
Educational. Inspirational. Motiva-
tional. Thanks to a fantastic eﬀort by
ICFS, Imperial Hub and the Student
Led Projects Symposium – that’s ex-
actly what students felt of this pilot
conference – see you next year where
we’ll go bigger and better!
