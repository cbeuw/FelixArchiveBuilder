A luxurious death
Alice Yang discusses whether fast fashion is killing luxury brands
ommon knowledge to
anyone who actually
wants to embark upon
a career in the near fu-
ture, the world economy
is dragging its feet along the ground
and practically all global growth has
been brought to a grinding halt. The
unfortunate result from all of this, be-
sides the lack of money each and every
one of us is painfully aware of, is the
negative commotion surrounding the
luxury sector.
Investors around the globe have
been worrying themselves to split-
ends as to how much the slow down
in emerging markets, especially China
will eﬀect the likes of Burberry and
Hugo Boss, as well as PPR and LVMH
– the corporate conglomerates that
own high fashion favourites such as
Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc
Jacobs, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent,
Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga etc.
And strangely enough, it seems that
the answer the boards of directors
have found themselves striving for
is design more, make more and sell
more FASTER. In other words, luxury
seems to be taking a dive towards the
world of fast fashion long trumpeted
by the high street.
Take for example Hugo Boss: since
appointing Claus-Dietrich Lahrs as
CEO of the company in 2008, the
brand has doubled the number of
yearly collections it produces to four,
reduced their overall development
times and poured €100m into an auto-
mated factory. From the
ﬁgures, this s e e m s
to have worked
well for t h e
company, with a
year-on-year growth of 6% in its nine-
month report this October, leading
to a comfortable 12% share price rise
this year. However, call me cynical,
but does this not defeat the point of
Hugo Boss being ‘luxury’? Surely, the
premium paid on an item of Hugo
Boss clothing as opposed to say, Zara,
should be mainly due to the excep-
tional quality of the garment, its pres-
tige and regrettably, in part, its name
label. But once rattled down to the
basics, of a t-shirt for example, I hate
to admit it but the improved quality of
the fabric itself no longer justiﬁes the
price hike given that both Boss and
Zara items are factory made.
Moving onto an even stranger com-
plaint, Nina Ricci’s recent additional
collections also seem like a bad move
away from their luxury high fashion
roots. The design house now have not
just the two standard spring/summer
and autumn/winter collections, as
well as the well popularised two pre-
spring and pre-fall collections, but
are now also hosting pre-pre-spring
and pre-pre-fall collections. All in all,
given that you trust my basic maths
skills, that adds up to 6 collections of
womenswear a year.
More explicitly put, in their attempt
to attract more buyers with their di-
minishing price points per ‘pre’ added
before the season, Nina Ricci seem to
be heading down the road towards
the fash- ion faux-pas land of A
Little Bit Of
Something For
Everyone,
otherwise
known as Marks & Spencer. You see,
the beloved British brand M&S fell
upon its own arrow towards suc-
cess when it stopped deﬁning its
customer base, and attempted to
target everyone – in short, the
company moved too quickly
into unknown market terri-
tory, and is now sitting on
a share price of just £3.79,
down from £7.49 at its
peak in 2007. And unfor-
tunately Nina Ricci seems
to be heading towards the
same fate. Of course dedi-
cated Ricci fans will still
buy their girly dresses,
but for those wanting
something ‘special’,
a bit of something
that makes them
feel above eve-
ryone else, which
let’s not even TRY and
deny is why many splash
out on high fashion, Nina Ricci will
no longer be the design house of
choice.
Once again, I state my case: the
deﬁnition and success of luxury
rests on prestige and unobtain-
ability. Once this is dissipated, it
will not be long before we see an
erosion in sales, and consequently
proﬁts.
Whilst of course there is a
chance that I may be proven hor-
rendously wrong, but, the way I see
it, the trend towards fast fashion may
be spelling out the ﬁnal demise of
certain brands. These brands
are such that they are inacces-
sible enough at the moment
to be termed ‘luxury’, yet are
not quite topping the stable
mountains of high fashion.
On top of this, there is also
the issue of designers
themselves. Peter
Copping, in taking
on 6 lines a year
for Nina Ricci,
may not be add-
ing too much to
his work load,
but what about
A l e x a n d e r
Wang who at
the young age
of 28 will now
be designing
32 collections a
year?
I kid you not,
fashion’s favourite
newbie, on being
awarded the job of
creative designer at
Balenciaga, is now
faced with designing
more lines per annum than years
he’s lived – four womenswear and
two menswear for BOTH Alexander
Wang and T by Alexander Wang; four
womens and two mens lines for the
bulk of his new job at Balenciaga; and
14 other lines (seven collections twice
a year) making up the rest of the PPR-
owned house. On top of that, there are
also swim lines, lingerie, shoes, bags
and jewellery to consider.
He may be young, and full of crea-
tive energy, but surely even Wang
can’t pump out 32 new full sets of
designs a year for long. And who can
blame him if he fails, after all none of
the old fashion guard have ever suc-
cessfully taken on so much. In fact
some designers, on reaching such a
level of success, decided to go their
own way: Jean-Paul Gaultier famously
chose his own brand over Hermés,
and Alexander McQueen too decided
that his own label was to win attention
over Givenchy. Even the multi-tasking
masters of creation seem to be ﬁnally
reaching the
end of their cre-
ative ideas;
Karl Lager-
feld’s designs for
Chanel, Fendi and
even his own eponymous label have
been getting somewhat boring despite
his outlandish attempts to spice things
up (see Chanel’s SS13 hula-hoop bag),
and even Marc Jacobs seems to be
running out of ideas with polka-dots
still not quite escaping his grasp (from
Marc Jacobs AW11, to Marc Jacobs
Dot Eau to Parfum and now alongside
Louis Vuitton’s collaboration with
Yayoi Kusama).
It seems that the recent onset of
panic from investors and CIOs push-
ing for proﬁts and margins seem to
have completely demolished the les-
sons learnt from John Galliano’s fall
from grace. But perhaps Wang and
his fellow new generation designers
will prove us wrong, and maybe, just
maybe, this new world of fast fashion
the high streets have been pioneering
for so long might just turn out to be a
success for luxury too. Whatever way
the tides turn, the onset of the New
Year looks like one to bring exciting
new times a-plenty.
