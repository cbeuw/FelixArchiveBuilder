Sir,
I was deeply moved by Philippa Skett’s
article the other week. Having occa-
sionally perused the Feminist Society
Facebook page, I cannot help but be im-
pressed by the quality of the writing
and the depth of the critical analysis.
However, I worry that some great scien-
tiﬁc brains are not so much honing their
critical thinking on the subject of femi-
nism as becoming completely immersed
by it. I for one have now been drawn in,
and have wasted an entire evening hav-
ing opinions! This is not a bad thing in
and of itself, but I feel that feminism is
now becoming too dominant in Impe-
rial’s society. Becky Lane’s admirable
eﬀorts to get people talking about sexist
discrimination are just one example of
this. We are all intelligent people who
wish to share our opinions. But chasing
after every misunderstanding and mis-
conception means that again and again
we must reiterate these arguments. Per-
haps we should all vote on a feminism
policy and then leave it and get back to
the library. And if the (male-dominat-
ed) vote concludes that sexism is a good
thing, then at least we’ll know for sure
that we have a problem!

Sir,
With all these articles on the topic of sex-
ism being published recently, I can’t help
but think that it’s the Feminist society that
is causing most of the problem. For start-
ers, why is it even called the Feminist Soci-
ety? Even though they claim that the term
is gender-neutral, surely they must realise
that the vast majority of people do not per-
ceive it to be so? Why not, for the avoid-
ance of doubt, call it the Gender Equality
Society?
Last year’s Felix Sexism Survey
showed that 10.14% of the sample of
631 students answered ‘yes’ to the ques-
tion ‘Is Imperial Sexist?’. To put that in
perspective, that’s a smaller percentage
of people than those who would cur-
rently vote for the Liberal Democrats,
according to a recent YouGov poll.
To me, it feels like this so-called
“Feminist Society” are using the prem-
ise of gender equality to front a moral
crusade against the rest of us, presum-
ably because they bear some kind of
perfunctory, puerile grudge against
society.
Maybe if their members wasted less time
on Facebook and Twitter searching for ex-
amples of sex discrimination and taking
turns to see who can denounce it using the
greatest number of nebulous bien-pensant
neologisms like “cis-privelege” (so that any
casual reader must resort to Wikipedia be-
fore they can fully fathom the profundity of
the critique), they may fare better in their
degree studies, personal relationships, and
life in general.
Thanks to FemSoc, Imperial now has a
reputation for sexism which, according to
a Felix survey, it does not deserve. They
have become the crux of the problem
which they sought to resolve. It’s time for
them to stop.

Sir,
Upon recently reading a London-wide
student paper I realised that, when it
comes to student politics and activ-
ism, Imperial displays the epitome of
apathy. I can’t think of anyone I know
who has attended any of the student
protests of late and no one really seems
to care about what the sabbaticals do.
I propose a small change that should
make Union politics at Imperial instant-
ly more divisive and interesting. I believe
that oﬃcers and candidates should be
ﬁltered into two diﬀerent political par-
ties in order to help students identify
with them and make the election process
all the more embittered.
These parties don’t necessarily have to
follow the traditional parliamentarian
left/right ideologies. There could instead
be the anti-sexism and pro-sexism par-
ties, or even the for and against Chris
Kaye parties. I hope that this subtle
change in how we elect sabbaticals will
engage Imperial students more with the
running of our union.
A cradle-to-grave Tory
or many, life has been nor-
mal so far; most have at-
tended school, the lucky
progressing onto universi-
ty, the majority then grad-
uating. However, I realised the next 10
years of my (professional) life could
creep up on me as quickly as the last
16 years, during which time I was be-
ing unwittingly conveyor-belted along
an education system and churned out
into real life. I felt like doing some-
thing diﬀerent, just for a while.
‘Normal’ life in the UK is considered
to be one of privilege and opportunity.
But this isn’t how the global picture
looks. How often do stop to wonder
why, let alone do anything about it?
While deciding my next step after
university, I chose to defer my job and
volunteer. In reading this I hope you
consider doing the same.
On 22 January 2013 I will begin a
3-month volunteering placement in
Bangladesh. I will be living as the lo-
cals do, collaborating with other over-
seas volunteers, local communities
and organisations to address problems
faced by severely impoverished com-
munities in Bangladesh. The focus is
on groups who are otherwise excluded
from social and economic growth and
who are less resilient to economic and
environmental shocks. (See end for
more details.)
Statistics surrounding poverty are
inaccessible and emotions can easily
be rationalised with our busy sched-
ules and daily commitments. But pov-
erty should never have become an ac-
ceptable thing to live with.
While I’m aware many of us already
volunteer in this country and donate
to charity when we can, many of us
think we’re unable to reach those in
distant countries, because we lack the
capital and the time. However, with
the help of donations and government
grants, VSO empowers 18-25 year
olds, such as us fresh graduate meat,
to lend our hands and brains for good
in some of the most impoverished
destinations on Earth.
Bangladesh, for example, suﬀers
from widespread childhood malnutri-
tion, and has one of the highest rates
of maternal mortality in the world.
There is also a high incidence of pre-

Putting the ‘Bang’ in Bangladesh: an
alternative way to spend Spring
Jonathan Kingsley is on a mission to help Bangladesh’s rural poor
ventable diseases, due to the lack of
access to and information about sani-
tation, hygiene, nutrition and sexual
health.
The opportunity to address these is-
sues ﬁrst hand requires a bit of com-
mitment on my own soil before I leave;
I am required to fundraise a minimum
of £800. This not only raises aware-
ness for the scheme so that others are
encouraged to get involved in ﬁghting
against poverty, but it facilitates young
people like us to take part.
So for those looking to do some-
thing memorable before knuckling
down to a job for the rest of your life,
consider volunteering your young,
imaginative minds to VSO. And when
that time comes, you’ll be in my shoes
recruiting the attention and generos-
ity of your peers to act against poverty.
But for now, you can make a diﬀer-
ence from the comfort of your Library
desk, your lecture theatre or your bed-
room. Lend your support by visiting
the page below to donate. Otherwise,
keep your nostrils dilated for the scent
of a bake sale next week on campus
and buy some delicious cakes. To keep
track of the various fundraising events
I’ll be doing.
