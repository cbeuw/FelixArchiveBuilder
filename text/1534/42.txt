Wii wish U a merry Zmas
Max Eggl details his discoveries at the Gadget Show Live!
he Wii U was released
about a week ago, with
a lot of curiosity sur-
rounding its release,
and I had the chance,
last Friday, to actually play it! A trip
to the Gadget Show Live, with very
plain press passes, allowed me to not
only jump all the cues, but actually
get a look and feel of the Wii U and
its weird controller. I only managed to
play a relatively short time, as well as
only two games, but that was enough
to get a good impression of what was
going on.
So here’s a quick overview of what
the Wii U entails. The controller is
quite a complex piece of equipment
and is a step removed from the re-
motes and nunchuks of the Wii. It’s a
screen surrounded by various buttons,
kinda like the bottom half of a DS, but
larger. What Nintendo is trying to do
is integrate a tablet into your gaming
experience, so that the second screen
enhances your playing capabilities, i.e.
by being the platform for mini-games.
Also if your brother, sister, girlfriend,
boyfriend etc. want to interrupt your
game time by using the TV screen for
another purpose, the Wii U control-
ler’s screen can serve as your game
screen. While, in theory, this concept
sounds relatively simple, in real life it’s
a bit more diﬃcult to understand.
Back to my
experience of the
Wii U. So, I stum-
bled into the Nintendo
area, and was surrounded
by various stations portraying a mul-
titude of games. At this point, I was
overcome with choice so I just picked
the ﬁrst station which was free. The
game I had chosen was Skylanders.
Skylanders was released quite re-
cently, and has beaten all expectations
to become one of the most popular
games for young teens in 2012. It in-
corporates the use of actual physical
toys, which are placed into the game
using a portal and then are playable
in-game. The Nintendo employee who
had been playing the game solo at that
point, invited me to play with him,
placing a ﬁgure onto the portal. Sadly
I can’t remember at all what this ﬁg-
ure looked like, as, at that moment, I
was still in a daze due to the copious
amounts of people and games, and
as such, unaware of all the little de-
tails. Then the controller was pushed
into my hand and I commenced play-
ing. The controller itself was a tad bit
heavy, and unwieldy but it wasn’t as
bad as I thought it would be. How-
ever when I started playing, the actual
complexity of the controller struck
me. I had no clue what to do. That was
the ﬁrst time ever that I had picked up
a game, and had no clue how to play.
Not even the Nintendo guy seemed to
know what was going on. The game
seemed to be a rail shooter, which are
notoriously simple to use, and yet nei-
ther me nor the actual employee had
an inkling of how to play. The graph-
ics of the game seemed quite nice, but
I could not really enjoy the game as I
was trying to ﬁgure out how to actual-
ly play. Perhaps a tutorial would have
helped, but the fact that you need to
have a tutorial for the console, which
is supposed to speak to the casual
gamer, it worries me how many ac-
tual casual gamers will pick this up.
Also the game itself didn’t actually
seem to use the touch screen that the
controller had to oﬀer, or maybe I
just hadn’t ﬁgured it out. After dying
about 6 times, I decided I would go to
the game I had actually wanted
to see, and allow some other
person to ﬁgure out how to
actually play. The game
I am talking about is
ZombiU.
ZombiU has been
in the works as long
as the Wii U has,
and it’s Nintendo’s
attempt to reach
the hardcore au-
dience of gam-
ers. Ever since I
saw some trail-
e r s and explanatory
videos of it on YouTube, I had
been excited to have a go at it. I was
quite sure that since Nintendo was
making this game just for the Wii U,
that the full promise of its controller
would be on full display. I am quite
the zombie fan, having played DayZ,
Resident Evil and many other games
concerning this subject. Thus when
I ﬁnally got to play, after seeing the
previous player brutally mauled, I was
raring to go! The guy in charge of this
station actually seemed to know what
to do, and explained the mechanics of
the game quite well. So when I picked
up the controller I felt ready to kick
some rotting zombie’s butt. Quite ee-
rily, the game started with me waking
up in a kindergarten (wonder how I
got there...). I had a bloody cricket bat
and a handgun with a few bullets to
spare. The setting and the feel of the
game reminded me a lot of DayZ, and
to be honest I actually was quite tense
during the game. My objective was to
ﬁnd a way out of the kindergarten and
survive. The screen of the controller
had a kind of map on it, which slightly
confused me, as I wasn’t sure at which
screen I should be looking, in the end
deciding to glance down at the map
every so often. This did irritate me
somewhat, as I prefer all my game info
to be within one concentrated area.
So I made my way through the kin-
dergarten with the occasional bloody
handprint on the walls. When the
ﬁrst zombie lunged out from behind a
corner, not only I jumped, but the lit-
tle audience that had formed around
me did as well. I did manage to kill
the annoying bugger by smashing his
head in (very graphic and bloody), but
I must say that the tablet-controller
did not seem anything special at that
point, and I would have perhaps pre-
ferred something smaller in my hand.
Also the looting of items was very
confusing, because you had to look
down onto the screen of the tablet,
and swipe from the loot to your bag,
confusing and, I thought, unnecessar-
ily complicated. Even though ZombiU
was turning out to be a great game,
the messiness and diﬃculty of using
the controller was starting to grate
at my nerves. Then came a locked
door. Apparently my character was
an expert lock-picker, and thus a little
mini-game came about where I had
to pick the lock of the door using the
controller. The mini-game was quite
simple, however I did take a peak at
the big screen, and was pleasantly
surprised to see my character in 3rd
person perspective actually trying to
pick the lock. This is a very nice touch
I think, because once you have zom-
bies coming up to you and you see
them out of the corner of your eye,
the tension mounts and opening that
door may not be that easy. Although
this involves you dividing your atten-
tion between two diﬀerent screens, it
just makes the game experience much
more realistic. In real life you would
be freaking out! When I did ﬁnally
die (killed by an annoying, special,
disappearing zombie) accompanied
by groans by the multitude of people
now ogling my game, I was sad and re-
lieved at the same time. Sad, because
my character, who I had grown to like
in my 15 minutes of playing, was dead,
and relieved because the game was so
goddam scary that I was glad it was
over.
The Wii U has a LOT of potential.
ZombiU is a class game that really did
manage to make me ﬂinch (and every-
onearoundme)atsomepoints.Itsreal-
ism
is great
(as much as you
can be realistic in a zom-
bie game), and I enjoyed mutilating
any zombie I came across. ZombiU
was perfectly optimised for the Wii U,
using all the features that the unique
controller had to oﬀer. Skylanders, on
the other hand, and probably the ma-
jority of games, are created by game
studios that do not understand all you
can do with the Wii U. This is one of
the biggest problems that Nintendo
faces, for if they do not get the right
support from the game makers i.e.
games made with the Wii U in mind,
nobody will buy this console, which
would be a big shame.
Another big stumbling block that
faces the Wii U is the complicated na-
ture of the tablet-controller. The casual
gamer,
t h e
original
audience
of the Wii,
w i l l face great dif-
ﬁculties to really get the most out of
their games without using the tutorial
or manual. Even me, a relatively ex-
perienced gamer had a few problems,
which sometimes caused frustration
more than enjoyment. All in all, I re-
ally hope that the Wii U persists and
actually achieves success. Nintendo
is trying to push a whole new way of
playing games, which I think could be
the next big thing. I thoroughly en-
joyed ZombiU, however with a price
of £350 for game and console, I am
a bit worried that not enough people
will buy it, since for that amount of
money, I know I wouldn’t.
