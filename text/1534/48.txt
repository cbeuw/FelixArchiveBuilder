mperial’s Finest News
Source Makes Triumphant
Return
After a two-week hiatus,
The Turnip, Imperial Col-
lege’s foremost source of news,
has made a stunning return, eye-
witnesses confirm. The award-
winning news bulletin famed
for its fluid-writing and piercing
journalism returns as the author
arrived back in the country af-
ter rumouredly broking peace in
the Middle East. “Thank God he’s
back, circulations been down,
we’ve been swamped with hatemail
and morale has been at an all-time
low” Felix Editor, Tim Arbabzadah,
was overheard saying before adding
“we’ve just not been able to produce
the same quality of article without
the confidence that, if it all back-
fires, we have the solid, dependable
Turnip to fall back on”. Whilst
rumours that the rest of Felix is
to be replaced with articles from
enigmatic journalist Hugh Moor
appear unfounded, it has become
clear that Mr Arbabzadah will be
replacing the front page, comments
and features sections in the near
future.
In related news, is the radioac-
tively reanimated Arafat out of
control? The resurrected former
President of the Palestinian Na-
tional Authority, brought back
to life by a crazed Bobby Pickett,
emerged from his ‘final’ resting
place last week and surged towards
Tel-Aviv, sources confirmed. Thus
far, Israel’s famous Iron Dome Ara-
fat Defence System has been unable
to intercept the former president
and he continues his relentless
march for revenge.
Elsewhere, other important stuff
maybe happened, but, to be fair,
they probably don’t matter.
