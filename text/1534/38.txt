1
Sound of Music: Jul-
ie Andrews plays a nun
turned governess for a
bunch of super cute Aus-
trian children and their super
hot father (Christopher Plum-
mer – just me?) Set against the
backdrop of WW2, this charming
family oriented film always gets
me in the mood for the holidays.
3
Bridget Jones & Bridget
Jones: The Edge of Rea-
son: Christmas just isn't
Christmaswithoutdearold
Bridget. Renee Zellweger plays the
hapless chain-smoking diarist per-
fectly; becoming the instant poster
child for singletons everywhere.
Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and
Spanx make this a holiday must.
5
Hook: This rework-
ing of the classic Peter
Pan story is great family
viewing, Robin Williams
plays the grown up Pan bril-
liantly, and Dustin Hoffman is
hilarious as the title villain. The
themes of family and the impor-
tance of being young at heart are
explored,andtheendingislovely.
6
Santa Claus: I was try-
ing to keep overtly
Christmassy films for
later in December, but
today is St Nicholas', a day for
the Germans and Dutch to get
into the festive spirit. Regard-
less of your nationality, enjoy
this straightforward film full
of reindeer, mischievous elves
and plenty of Christmas cheer.
7
Moulin Rouge: Baz Luhr-
mann's masterpiece is one
of my favourite films ever,
and whilst not festive (ex-
cept for its colour palette), has
some amazing medleys and re-
workings of classic songs. The di-
rection is great: stylish, fantastical
and theatrical – and Nicole Kid-
man and Ewan McGregor shine in
the leading roles.
8
Fantasia: for those who
have been paying at-
tention, I hate this film,
but the decision about
whether or not to include it was
vetoed by my co-Editors. These
early Disney animations set to
various works of classical mu-
sic are widely thought to be
charming and kitschy, and are
a favourite for this time of year.
9
Edward Scissorhands:
Set at Christmas-time,
Johnny Depp plays an
artificIal man with
scissors for hands. Uncom-
monly gentle, he has pity taken
on him by a family, and falls in
love with their eldest daughter
Kim (Winona Ryder). Tragedy
ensues, but the film remains
heartwarming and magical.
10
The Holiday:
Stuffed fuller
than a turkey
with national ste-
reotypes, this rom-com set over
Christmas and New Year is es-
sential viewing. When Winslet
and Diaz get bored of their LA
/Cotswolds lives respectively,
they house-swap for the holiday
season. Funny and feel-good.
11
Polar Express: the
hugely successful
computer anima-
tion tells the story
of a young boy aboard a powerful
magical train on a journey to the
North Pole to see Santa. This is a
filmaboutselfdiscoveryandfaith.
This is a visually stunning film,
with voiceovers by Tom Hanks.
12
Elf: Will Ferell stars
as Buddy, a human
brought up with the
Elves at the North
Pole travels to New York to meet
his heartless birth father Walter.
This is a goofy comedy with some
touching themes. It is inevitably
clichéd, but that's probably what
you want in a light holiday film.
13
Lady and the
Tramp: the list
was looking a lit-
tle Disney light,
and this is about as Christmas-
sy as Disney gets without be-
ing terrible. Adorable Lady falls
in love with stray dog Tramp
over a plate of spaghetti and
meatballs. Ridiculously cute.
14
The Muppets Christ-
mas Carol: the re-
telling of the classic
Dickens tale, with the
beloved Muppets cast. I was actually
quitescaredofthisasachild.Scrooge,
the ultimate grumpy old man, is tak-
en on a trip in time by the ghosts of
Christmas Past, Present and Future
in a bid to change his mean ways.
15
Miracle on 34th
Street: An old
man claiming to
be Santa is institu-
tionalised as insane, but a young
lawyer decides to prove in court
that he is the real deal. This is a
warmhearted classic about the
real meaning of Christmas, and
a step away from commercialism.
2
Harry Potter and the
Philosopher's Stone:
The first in the fran-
chise, revisit a time
when the wizarding trio were
young and cute. Harry faces
the evil Voldemort for the first
time, but the film is not as dark
as the later films. Plus there's
snow so it's vaguely festive.
4
Happy Feet: this com-
puter animated Academy
Award winning musical
film is visually incredible
and features wintery scenery and
adorable penguins. Penguins are
supposedtosingtoattractamate,
but Mumble has a terrible voice.
His talent lies in tap dancing.
A beautiful and touching film.
