So Close: Imperial at THE Awards
Imperial College was nominated for
two Times Higher Education Awards
this year: Most Improved Student
Experience and Outstanding Sup-
port for Early Career Researchers.
Imperial however lost out in each
category, losing to the University of
Chester and the University of York
respectively. The nominations; par-
ticularly for ‘Most Improved Student
Experience’ ought to be good news
for Imperial that has lagged behind
other universities in student satisfac-
tion ratings which has contributed to
disappointing Guardian Rankings in
recent years. (It came in 13th in the
2013 rankings behind the University
of Bath, The University of Essex and
perhaps most disturbingly, UCL).
The awards that aim to “recognize
excellence and reward extraordinary
innovation, talent and imagination of
UK higher education” were initiated
in 2007. Judging was carried out “by
a distinguished panel of experts” that
included Sir Deian Hopkin, President
of the National Library of Wales and
Liam Burns, President of the Na-
tional Union of Students. Universi-

Last month Imperial saw the return
of Charity Week, an annual campaign
organised by the Islamic Society with
the aim of raising as much money as
possible for orphans and needy chil-
dren worldwide. This year the Week
was held between 29 November and
4 December, however some events
were held outside of this week due to
room booking constraints. Months
of preparation and behind the scenes
work culminated in a series of excit-
ing and innovative events, including
the now much renowned ‘Battle of
the Societies’ quiz night, which saw
over 20 societies ﬁght it out to win
the coveted trophy and all the glory
that comes along with it (won by
the Tamil Society), as well as street
and tube collections all over West
London which over 100 students
took part in. The Week reached its
climax with the prestigious Charity
Week Annual Dinner, this year held
in Hammersmith Town Hall, which
was attended by over 250 Imperial
students and staﬀ, including Paul
Beaumont, Union President, and
Deputy President Henry Whittaker,
Deputy President (Clubs & Socie-
ties). A massive £18,000 was raised
on the night, partly down to the ex-
citing auction (which saw a choco-
late cake go for £1,250), but also due
to the generosity of 21 individuals
who each sponsored an orphan for a
year’s duration.
Charity Week is a national cam-
paign facilitated by one of the UK’s
leading charities – Islamic Relief –
one of 14 charities that make up the
UK’s Disaster Emergency Commit-
tee. For this speciﬁc campaign, they
operate under a 100% donation poli-
cy, meaning that every penny raised
by students will go towards helping
orphans and needy children world-
wide (the exact destinations will
be voted on shortly), without there
being any admin costs. As stated
in their mission statement, they al-
locate resources regardless of race,
political aﬃliation, gender or belief,
and without expecting anything in
return.
All in all, Imperial College students
managed to raise £46,939, com-
ing third after UCL and Kings (who
raised £50,748 and £50,369 respec-
tively), but considering that Impe-
rial has nearly half the number of
students that either institution has,
this was a tremendous eﬀort by all
those who participated and donated,
and the Islamic Society said that they
would like to thank everyone who
took part.
ties that do not traditionally top the
League Tables have dominated the
Awards; it indicates perhaps a degree
of complacency among the ‘more
prestigious’ institutions. Imperial has
however won awards for ‘Outstand-
ing Contribution to Innovation and
Technology’ in 2009 and for Out-
standing Support for Early Career
Researchers in2008
Times Higher Education currently
ranks Imperial 8th in the world put-
ting it in A league with MIT and
Stamford and a couple of places
ahead of Yale and Columbia (but a
mere 49 places ahead of King’s Col-
lege London). The rankings have
however been criticized for the im-
portance given to citations in calcu-
lating its rankings which has lead to
a sidelining of universities whose lan-
guage of instruction isn’t English. Im-
perial currently ranks among the Top
10 universities in the world among
most major surveys including the QS
Rankings and THE.
It’s the return
of the yard
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Paul Beaumont, Union President, has
proposed a new “Retailing of Alco-
hol” policy to the Executive Commit-
tee (Exec.), which will change the bar
opening hours and yards.
The bar will now have to remain
open until the advertised closing time
(which is section 5 of the policy).
Yards, as mentioned above, will also
be aﬀected. This is the largest inser-
tion into the policy. It will mean that
they are allowed and it sets out the
process for doing yards. The proce-
dure will be how it has been ever since
they were brought back – yards were
banned for a short period of time.
The policy was one of Beaumont’s
manifesto points and he said that he
wanted to “review it whilst remain-
ing within the law and the spirit of the
law”.
The Alcohol Policy Committee
was something that was put in place
in 2010 by the DPFS of the time,
but,technically, it was breaking the
Constitution (the document that gov-
erns the rules by which the Union is
to be run). It contravened the Consti-
tution by having staﬀ on a committee,
which is prohibited, and so, is now
gone.
