Lovestruck
Sorry, but last week’s vague reference to Love Actually
literally made me write in with the intent of getting some-
thing off my chest. It’s an awful awful film and I hate it.
That guy who stalks Keira Knightley – yikes. And yet by the
end when they’re all happy in the airport and that horrible
song just repeats itself, I’m broken by it. I’m grinning from
ear to ear. More often than not I wake up the next morn-
ing seriously regretting the viewing habits of the past. I’m
sorry to put such a downer on things but it’s Lovestruck
and Christmas related. – Love Actually Hater harangued in
Huxley
Awwwwwww, warms the heart, doesn’t it? If you have
any tales of romance or, alternatively, completely un-
related tangents to embark upon, email felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk and the dubious limelight could be yours!
It’s Christmas
Anyway, I’m off to my Christmas
job, namely being a pundit for the
hundreds of documentaries that
are currently being produced to
tie in with the Duchess of Cam-
bridge’s pregnancy. Easiest job
ever, all you have to say is that the
baby’s going to have a “traditional
name, but potentially with a bit of
a twist for a middle name”. Here’s
hoping for something classic for
that middle name, like Garfield, or
something along those lines. Roll-
ing in dollar. Merry Giftmas.
Coffee Break Boss
I’m writing this through a cascade
of uncontrollable tears – alas, tis
the season of the last issue of the
year. That’s right folks, like an slow-
ly advancing army of overweight
men in red and white, Christmas is
interminably trudging on towards
us and we’ll have to take a bit of a
break.
But this is only the beginning!
Remember, if you’ve also wanted
to be involved with Felix in some
fashion, all it takes is an email to
felix@imperial.ac.uk.
