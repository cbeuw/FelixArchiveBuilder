Good Guy Master Chief
(To the tune of Good King Wenceslas)
Good guy Master Chief woke up
On Forward Unto Dawn
When the Covenant turned up
War again begun.
Then they crashed on Requiem,
Killed Prometheans
When the Didact said to them:
“Slaughter all the humans!”
“Hey Cortana, stick with me,
Our future seems quite grim,
Yonder Didact, what is he?
We really need to kill him.”
“Chief, we’ve got the Infinity,
Crashing down around us
Lets go save Commander Lasky
Their lives rest on our success”
“Bring me tanks and DMRs,
Bring me shotguns hither
Thou and I will kick his ass
When we bear him thither.”
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind’s wild lament
And the bitter weather.
“Chief, I’ve got some problems here
It’s my rampancy,
I’m eight years old, and I fear
I need to find Doc. Halsey.”
“Mark my words, my oldest friend
We’ll get you back to Earth
I promise that this tale won’t end
With any less than mirth.”
In to the slipstream dark, they flew
Where the Didact entered
Ahead of them they always knew
Humanity’s fate awaited
UNSC men, be sure
Wealth or SR owning
Ye who now will bless the poor
Will not be killed by spawn-camping
MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE FELIX GAMES TEAM!
