T
his week’s news brings
a variety of different
events to focus. As well
as a well attended RAG
week (see our facebook
page for pictures), we’ve hosted
an International Model United
Nations Conference, finished
ArtsFest and won a hackathon
It’s also getting close to the end
of the Big Elections nomination
period. Before you find out the
full list of nominations from the
Union website (or ours) after the
candidate’s meeting on Monday
we’re publishing a slightly
updated list of people running
for positions. Have you got the
guts to stand and be counted?
