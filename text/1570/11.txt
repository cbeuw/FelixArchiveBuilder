A
new study indicating
wind farms have a
much longer lifespan
than previously
thought are showing
that the critics were wrong in claiming
that investing in ageing wind farms is
a poor choice.
Wind power can and does produce
up to 14% of the UK’s electricity at
certain times of the day. Whilst this
does vary depending on weather
conditions as well as other factors,
wind is already the key leader by some
stretch in reaching our UK generation
target of 15% from renewables by
2020. To safeguard this it’s essential
that many of the wind farms built in
the mid-1990s attract the investment
required for refinancing.
Early studies conducted by critics
of wind farms previously claimed
electricity generation from them
would fall by a third after just a decade
of operational use, potentially making
them economically unviable. A new
and comprehensive study conducted
by Imperial College Business School
shows this is far from the truth.
Imperial researchers assessed the
UK’s fleet of all 4,246 wind turbines
across all 531 wind farms and found
that even the earliest of them built in
the early 1990s were operating at three
quarters of their original output after
almost 20 years of operation and thus
are now easily expected to last their
full predicted lifespan of 25 years.
Dr Iain Staffell, co-author of the
paper and researcher at Imperial
College stated that “Our study
provides some certainty, helping
investors to see that wind farms are
an effective long-term investment
and a viable way to help the UK tackle
future energy challenges.” It was also
mentioned that with the improved
design of turbines built today and
the huge improvements seen over
the last two decades in the operation
and maintenance of the technology,
wind farms are actually becoming
increasingly attractive investment
propositions, banishing the fears one
held on their long term viability.
A
fresh new enquiry
has been ordered by
NHS England medical
director Professor Sir
Bruce Keogh following
the care of ten children who died or
were left seriously injured following
cardiac surgery at Bristol Royal
Hospital for Children. Professor
Keogh met with the families of the
children last Friday where he heard
stories depicting a “catalogue of
neglect and poor care”.
Sir Ian Kennedy, who led the famous
Bristol heart inquiry in the 90s, will
again be chairing the investigation. It
is likely that they will again conclude
that the paediatric cardiac services
at Bristol are “simply not up to
task”. The 90’s inquiry discovered
shortages of key surgeons and nurses,
a lack of leadership, accountability,
and teamwork, which is frankly
unacceptable in this day and age.
Harley Pascoe, who was born with
half a heart, was transferred to Bristol
four days after his birth to have a tube
inserted to improve his blood flow.
His operation, however, was cancelled
five times in one week because he was
“not sick enough”, and he died whilst
waiting.
SirKennedy,alongwithparentsofthe
affected children will independently
review each case in the forthcoming
months and will hopefully get to the
bottom of this tragedy.
W
ith 33 medals
and 13 Golds the
Sochi Olympics
was a resounding
success for
Russia’s athletes; they topped the
table and according to Putin, restored
national sporting pride. The $51 billion
vanity project all came together, and
even the rain couldn’t dampen the
party.
However, in addition to the well-
publicised homophobic measures
and the senseless cruelty to animals
in build up to the games, there was a
silent evil lurking by the black sea; the
sustainability legacy.
Like Vancouver and London before
it, the Games set out to be the first
ever carbon neutral event, but just
like Eddy the Eagle in ’88, they fell
well short. But it’s not all bad. The
ambitious plan to plant five saplings
for every tree felled was implemented,
fish stocks have been replenished,
eco-friendly sewage and energy
works have received investment.
The organisers even went some way
towards offsetting some of the 160,000
tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions
resulting indirectly from the event.
The environmental legacy of the
event is, on balance, a disaster.
Construction near the Caucasus
Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO heritage
site) had devastating impacts, and the
state rail operator dumped waste in
the Mzymta River Valley. Villages like
Ashtyr, overlooking nearby Sochi,
have been left in ruin with open
quarries, polluted water resources
and high speed rail links going within
metres of their homes.
So after banning the gays and
exterminating the strays it seems that
Russia shan’t change its polluting
ways.
E
ver felt insecure about your
stubbly legs or unbleached
‘tache? Well then you will
no doubt be impressed by
the bravery of Harnaam
Kaur – the 23 year old lady who has
been keeping a full beard for almost
seven years. At the age of eleven, she
was embarrassed to discover that she
had excessive hair growth on her face,
which then spread to her chest, arms
and the rest of her body.
This is because she suffers from
a condition called polycystic ovary
syndrome (PCOS), which is estimated
to affect one in five women in the
UK, though over 50% of people are
symptomless.
School became unbearable as she
became the subject of vicious and
cruel bullying which led her to isolate
herself in her house and later suffered
from suicidal thoughts. However,
when she was 16 she was baptised
as a Sikh. In the Sikh faith, followers
are encouraged to keep their hair
to embrace the perfection of God’s
creation.
About a month after her conversion,
she decided to embrace her hair and
vowed never to return to the endless
waxing, bleaching and shaving she
resorted to in her teens. She claims
now that she has never felt more
feminine or sexy and is sharing her
story on YouTube in order to help
other women gain self-confidence.
Certainly, I feel inspired and think this
is a thought-provoking example of the
importance of having the confidence
to do whatever makes YOU feel
beautiful, regardless of what others
may think.
