POETRY CORNER
Poem from the Bintag
by Oscar McGinty
Under the clouds and into the seas of old
That roll on knowingly as these tales unfold,
Passion and loss grow old together,
Smiling, hand in hand, watching the weather;
As their futures fade into a thing of the past,
They slowly drift apart, now losing their grasp;
Passion rising to skies where feelings learn to walk
And loss, sinking down to depths where nobody
talks;
To wait and listen for that familiar hum
Of racing thoughts coming to life under the sun.

More Than A Taste
A
Taste of Honey is a
play as predictable, yet
ironic as its title would
suggest.
Let me explain
more. Helen is a whinging single
mother more interested in keeping
her hair fixed in place than feeding
her whinging teenage daughter. She
abandons her child for her alcoholic
fiancé, 10 years her junior. A black
sailor gets his way with young,
innocent Jo and also abandons her,
pregnant. She befriends a gay art
school student who uses his bursary
to look after her while she is too
ashamed to leave the house and work.
The alcoholic runs off with another
woman and Helen comes back to the
squat she left her daughter in.
The plot really is as simple as it
sounds – like any television soap I
would have turned off by now, was a
thought that flitted through my mind
every five minutes.
However, this does not mean that
A Taste of Honey is a bad play. It
was written by 20 year old Shelagh
Delaney in 1958; a working class
young lady from Salford. She had had
no formal training in play-writing and
had only left school three years prior.
Being such a forward-thinking first
play, it was no surprise that it was such
a success in the then male-dominated
world of theatre. Delaney truly was
Britain’s first working class female
playwright.
Her background is reflected in her
writing. There is no pretension or
fantasy when portraying working-
class Salford, and the comedy is down
to earth and abrupt, if a little 50s
slapstick.
Despite being a superficially simple
play, the heavy relationships between
characters required some sturdy
acting too. This came in the form
of Lesley Sharp as Helen, and Kate
O’Flynn who played an excellently
annoying and throttle-able Jo.
Asalways,productionattheNational
Theatre lived up to the excellent
expected standards. The direction
(Bijan Sheibani) prevented the piece
becoming tedious despite only having
two settings. The choreography (Aline
David) and music (Paul Englishby)
also added to the endearing 50s vibe,
topping off the whole piece.
Although it may leave the audience
with mixed feelings, especially
younger viewers who have grown
up with hard, fast action and intense
emotional turmoil of modern
television, films, and plays; it is a
piece which is excellently brought to
life, even if a little underwhelming for
modern times.
What: Richard Deacon
Where: Tate Britain, SW1

I
n its current headline exhibition,
Tate Britain is looking back on the
life of sculptor Richard Deacon, a
keystone in the British art scene
over the past thirty-five years.
Although not as well known as
fellow sculptors Anish Kapoor and
Anthony Gormley, Deacon is no less
impressive. Gaining recognition in the
early 1980’s as part of the Young British
Sculptors movement, he cemented his
position at the top of his field after
being awarded the Turner Prize in
1987 and has continued advancing his
style ever since.
This exhibition explores his artistic
evolution in a well considered and
beautifully displayed showcase that
spans his whole career, from his
earliest creations to pieces like Fold,
which makes its first ever public
appearance this month.
Poetry and philosophy form an
important source of inspiration for
Deacon, and sonnets by Austrian
poet Rilke inspire the elegant set of
sketches that greet you as you enter
the exhibition space. A complex
layering of graphite and pastel, It’s
Orpheus When There’s Singing feels
simultaneously mathematical and
organic: an engineer’s blueprints with
its precise network of construction
lines overlaid with a form as fluid and
rhythmic as Orpheus’ sonorous lyre.
It is in his exploration of
contradictions like this that makes
Deacon so exciting. Geometric is
made organic; heavy seems light; a
void is somehow given mass. In Out
of Order, he manipulates wood into
unimaginable shapes. Corkscrews of
steamed oak curl in a way more akin to
wire; lyrical, as if defying gravity.
Only Deacon would be able to
achieve this. Throughout his career
he has experimented with a wide
range of materials, developing an
exceptional understanding of their
character and qualities. He describes
himself as a fabricator and the process
of production is important for him.
Glue oozes out from the layers of
laminated timber. Welds, rivets and
screws – all clear to see – add to this
sense of process, giving each piece its
individuality.
In his abstract forms, Deacon
does not provide you with an ideal
perspective from which to enjoy the
piece. In fact there are an infinite
number of points of view from which
you can observe it; each unique, no
one better than another. This equality
in experience encourages you to
walk around a work, scrutinise it and
interact with it. This was especially the
case with Out of Order where there
was nothing I wanted to do more than
go inside the piece and explore it from
a completely different perspective.
After is another work that really
stood out for me: a serpentine lattice
of wood writhing across the floor, only
to be tamed by the leash of glistening
steel that bisects its body. In no other
piece is the relationship between space
and volume so masterfully explored.
The curving ribs define a void that
is given the illusion of mass, making
the thrashing creature even more
formidable and powerful. And so,
when the rigid metal band tethers this
raw energy to the floor, the tension
created is almost unbearable. The
sweeping form contrasted with a
strong dividing line harks back to the
drawings from earlier on but now in
3D, diving through space in the same
dynamic fashion as one sees in much
of Deacon’s work.
The only pieces I didn’t particularly
connect with were from his Art for
Other People series, a collection of
smaller pieces designed for display in
private residences. His works are so
much about space and form that on a
smallscale,youjustdon’trelatetothem
in the same way. They feel static and
lack the overwhelming effect of some
larger pieces like After, which steals the
show for me. This Tate retrospective
is well worth a visit; an excellent
selection of works carefully chosen to
highlight Deacon’s phenomenal skill
and mastery of material, revealing why
he is seen as one of Britain’s foremost
innovators in sculpture.
