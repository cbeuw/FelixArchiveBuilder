Devils lose
narrowly to set up
grandstand varsity
clash against UCL
A narrow 3-2 defeat for the Impe-
rial Devils in a regular season clash
against the UCL Yetis has set the stage
for an intense and exciting London Ice
Varsity.
If you haven’t heard already, tonight
Imperial’s very own ice hockey team
will take on their UCL counterparts
in the 2nd annual London Ice Varsi-
ty. This meant that what should have
been a standard league game was filled
with rivalry, intensity and a little bit of
violence from the very first minute.
After only 46 seconds, the Devils
found themselves shorthanded as
American centre Gordo Weigers was
sent to the penalty box for slashing.
Undeterred, the scoring was opened
after only 4 minutes by Imperial for-
ward Gus Zimmerman, slotting a
sharp angle shot through the net-
minder’s legs. Not to be put down
lightly, the Yetis fought back aggres-
sively – scoring 2 goals before the end
of the first period and taking 3 sepa-
rate penalties for unnecessary contact.
With Oli Clipsham of the Devils sent
to the penalty box early in the second
period, Imperial had to work hard not
to let UCL capitalise on their man ad-
vantage. Spurred on by the high stakes
and the abundance of adrenaline flow-
ing, tempers overflowed as Max Fink
took down the captain of the Yetis in
front of the Imperial net. The result-
ing fight included 3 members of each
team, who were too riled up to bother
removing helmets before throwing
punches. Surprisingly, the referee only
sent 2 members of each team to the
penalty box, allowing the instigators
of the fight to continue unaffected.
With both teams having returned to
full strength, the Yetis managed to put
themselves 3-1 into the lead before a
last gasp defensive effort led to Zim-
merman taking a penalty for checking
(look it up on YouTube, it’s the best bit
of the sport) a player who did not have
the puck. Whilst Zimmerman was
serving his time, Weigers broke past
the fragile UCL defence to power a
slapshot past a hapless Yeti netminder.
This brought the score to 3-2 in UCL’s
favour towards the end of the second
period.
Comedy was provided throughout
the game in the form of delayed re-
starts as UCL seemed to frequently
send fewer players onto the ice than
they needed. However, the lack of a
player with any discernable arithmetic
ability eventually put them at a dis-
advantage as they took two separate
penalties for having too many men
on the ice. This allowed Imperial to
put on the pressure throughout the
third period, where they enjoyed the
majority of possession and managed
to outshoot the Yetis. UCL were only
rescued in the dying minutes of the
match as Imperial winger Matthew
Choy rang a shot off the goal post. The
game ended 3-2.
With the teams now focusing all of
their efforts on the London Ice Varsity,
the memory of such a close game will
surely serve to spur them on. If the
Devils play to the level they showed
in the final period and continue to
match (if not, better) the intensity and
aggression of their rivals, the glory is
theirs for the taking. The London Ice
Varsity is beginning to heat up, you
don’t want to miss it!
The London Ice Varsity takes
place tonight at 7:30pm. Tickets are

IC take positives from difficult Kendo meet
IC ICE HOCKEY
After a host of matches being
rescheduled due to the unrelenting
wet weather, ICUWRFC were glad
to be out on the pitch again. The
team had a strong set of backs who
would later make their presence
felt by GKT (Guy’s, King’s and
St. Thomas’), whilst the forwards
welcomed Tessa Davey “Jone’s
Locker” and Aamna Mohdin who
made their first appearances in the
forward pack.
GKT did not collect the first
kick off cleanly and IC moved
swiftly over the loose ball to secure
a turnover. Several phases of
forward play combined with good
passing in the backs to brought IC
up the pitch. GKT responded well
to defend their try line and stop
the forwards opening the score
but the sustained pressure in GKT
territory eventually led to a break
when the backs combined well to
send Sam Gottarrdi over for the
opening try.
IC put boot to ball with great
effect to get behind GKT’s defence.
The opposition full back had a
busy day, having to make many
numerous cover tackles to prevent
the score line growing even wider.
But support across the IC players
meant that there was always a
teammate close behind to secure
possession or receive an quick
pop pass. This allowed the team to
literally run away with the play and
crafty footwork from Sam Gottardi
and player of the match Heather
Grant led to several more tries.
Receiving the kick off, Charlie
Stephens and Lana Lee always
seemed to be on hand forcing GKT
into making hard tackles. Forwards
took the ball in and offloaded
brilliantly around the breakdown.
Fly half Yas Edwards also went
crashing in to send a bunched
GKT defense into disarray which
the backs took full advantage of. In
fact, this combination would prove
so successful especially in the latter
half when successive restarts from
GKT lead to very similar tries in
quick succession.
Tries were conceeded late in each
half which saw GKT’s forwards take
the ball into contact and edged to
the try line. Line speed in defence is
something IC will want to go away
and work on. Nonetheless it was an
incredible team performance from
IC to win convincingly with the
final score at 72-10.

Imperial’s 1st XI slot
three past Royal
Holloway
On Saturday 15th February 2014,
ICUAFC 1s made the well known
trip to Harlington to face Royal
Holloway 1s. In goal ICUAFC
made an emergency loan signing of
their former goalkeeper, and 2012-
2013 Player of the Year (although
he hates talking about it because
it’s really embarrassing) Henry
Garner. His presence perked up
the likes of Amjad and Nielsen
who commented how their lives
had lost some meaning since
his departure from the team. In
this way, a (Biology) father was
returned with a son, much like
Odysseus and Telemachus upon
their reuniting at Ithica, as Alex
Dale gratefully clutched Garner
to his bosom murmuring ‘I knew
you’d return father’.
After this rather surreal and
largely exaggerated turn of events
the team warmed up in good
spirits, relieved that the previous
night’s ritualistic lamb slaughter
had brought some respite from
the recent torrential downpours.
The match started brightly and
Holloway found themselves behind
after only 1 minute as a defender
handled the ball, with his hand, and
Robinson dispatched the penalty
with aplomb, sending the keeper
the wrong way in the process.
Imperial, like so many champions,
were winning without playing
particularly well.
The mentally challenged offender
couldn’t help but continuously
shout at Captain Robinson calling
him a ‘f**king idiot’ for thinking
that the handball in the box was,
in fact, a handball in the box, but
these were met with an immediate
retaliation of ‘No mate, you are
the f**king idiot for giving away
a penalty in the first minute’, to
which silence quickly followed.
No more than 10 minutes later
Imperial had scored again. Winger
Dale, who had already skinned his
opposition fullback alive multiple
times, broke down the wing and
sent in a high loopy cross which
was held up in the gale force winds.
About 35 seconds later, it returned
to Earth, and Captain Robinson
was there waiting for it, having
physically held of the Centre Back
for the aforementioned 35 seconds,
and duly finished it off with a first
time volley. 2-0.
Holloway had several chances
to pull a goal back but Holloway’s
striker, the aptly named Torres,
Henry Garner
ICUAFC
was having no luck. At this point it
would be easy to make a joke about
how he was worse than Chelsea FC’s
very own Fernando Torres, but that
would be too easy. I will instead take
the moral high ground and say that
on a good day he could be considered
equal with Emile Heskey. At one
point another Holloway striker
managed to beat the offside trap but
was only able to shoot straight at
ICUAFC’s very own Petr Cech.
AfterasternteamtalkfromCaptain
Robinson, the players resumed the
second half endeavouring not only to
win but to win well; Barcelona rather
than Stoke City. Imperial dominated
proceedings despite heading into
the wind although Holloway were
adamant they should have had
a penalty after left back Nugent
handled the ball with his face. I’ll
let you work out why it wasn’t given
and why contrary to Holloway’s
appeals, it was not ‘exactly the same’
as their hand ball. Shortly after this,
Cherif, clearly still in the Valentine’s
Day mood, fired a delightful cross
field through ball over the top of
Holloway’s defence, like Cupid
loosing an arrow from his quiver,
which found Dale, who full of love in
his heart, tenderly invited the keeper
out of his box for a candle lit dinner,
before lobbing him with no remorse.
Holloway were in fact to get on
the score sheet when a through ball
evaded the defence and the last ditch
attempt of Amjad (maybe he should
try and shift up a gear just once in his
life) and found the striker (it wasn’t
Torres, he had been taken off by this
point for ‘footballing reasons’) who
found the bottom corner. However,
the goal would prove only a hollow-
ay consolation for the visiting side.
Imperial comfortably managed to
hold out for the 3-1 win, without
really getting out of Omar Amjad’s
world renowned first gear.
