Capital One Cup Final
Manchester City v Sunderland
(Sunday 2pm, Sky Sports 1)
Contests between these sides have
been highly unpredictable of late,
with Sunderland claiming more than
their fair share of wins at the Stadium
of Light and Man City experiencing
some scares on home turf as well.
Make no mistake, City will be haunted
by the memory of losing to Wigan
Athletic in last year’s FA Cup Final and
after having to change strategy against
Chelsea and Barcelona of late, Manuel
Pellegrini will set up his side to play to
their strengths – as a goalscoring ma-
chine. The Black Cats have played so
much better in the cup than the league
this year, and credit to Gus Poyet for
masterminding so many shock scalps
along the way, but this will surely be
one hurdle too far.
Prediction: 2-0
Southampton v Liverpool
(Saturday 5:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
This is intriguing because Saints con-
tinue to look the real deal while the
Reds’ attacking diamond has been
prolific of late. Expect goals, that’s
for sure, but Liverpool showed real
character to come from behind twice
against Fulham in their last away
match and I can see a similar story
panning out at St Mary’s.
Prediction: 2-3
Aston Villa v Norwich
(Sunday 4:30pm, Sky Sports 1)
I fear the Canaries’ victory against
Spurs last weekend was just a flash in
the pan; Chris Hughton desperately
needs his attackers to start scoring
goals Despite their home difficulties, I
am sure Villa’s manager Paul Lambert
would love to get one over his former
club.
Prediction: 2-1
Best of the rest
(Saturday 3pm unless stated)
Hull v Newcastle
Even when they beat Aston Villa, the
Magpies do not look the same side
with nothing to play for and without
their playmaker Yohan Cabaye. Steve
Bruce has said he would love to do the
double over Newcastle, and it’s a great
chance to stave off any lingering rel-
egation fears.
Prediction: 2-1
Stoke v Arsenal
The Potters give everyone a game
at the Britannia Stadium and have
claimed 4 points off the Gunners’ title
rivals Man City and Chelsea already
this season. I don’t think Arsenal will
be able to live with Stoke’s abrasive
style which will allow for precious few
free-flowing moves.
Prediction: 1-1
Swansea v Crystal Palace
(Sunday 4:30)
The Swans could probably do without
the distraction of the Europa League
right now, although Garry Monk is ex-
actly the kind of manager players will
respond to even if they are in need of
a break. Palace may be in fine home
form but they have to sit back on the
road and the points continue to elude
them.
Prediction: 2-1

IC take positives from
difficult Kendo meet
Jake Humphrey gives his account
The first part of any competition is
getting to the competition, but Brit-
ain never was renowned for having
good weather. This stayed true with
the storm the day before causing de-
lays, confusion and ultimately pushing
back the competition start time. But it
meant we got a lie-in before the tour-
nament, which is always nice especial-
ly after a Friday night. This year it was
held in Canterbury at the University of
Kent with twelve different universities
competing. Some universities fielded
several teams leading to one large ac-
tion-packed competition.
First up was the Kyu-grade tourna-
ment for people with less than three
years of experience, which are rela-
tively small fry compare to the Dan-
grade black belts. However no one
told them this, and they fought with
all their spirit and confidence. There
were nine in total representing Im-
perial in the Kyu-grade, though un-
fortunately in the second round, two
Imperial comrades, Rene Wong and
Adam Gestwa, had to fight it out in
an intense match. In the end, Joseph
Yao, Adam Gestwa, Edward Ying, and
Jason Li were knocked out in the quar-
terfinals.
Next was the Dan-grade, with five
“samurai” representing our club.
Unfortunately the men faced formi-
dable foes, with Jake Humphrey’s op-
ponent going on to place first. This re-
sulted in first round losses across the
board, but our warriors gave their op-
ponents long hard-fought battles. In
the ladies’ competition, Luz Nguyen
performed exceptionally throughout
the day fighting off numerous com-
petitors to obtain a well-earned and
hard-fought third place.
After a day’s worth of ‘practice’,
it was now time to show Imperial’s
strength in the teams’ competition.
This was also split into Kyu and Dan
grade. Initially the Kyu team was up
against York. The first match was a
draw followed by a loss (however,
Adam was still able to score a point
with men (head) strike). Next up was
Yihan Ng and Edward Ying who both
drew 0:0. This left a lot of pressure on
Joseph who had to win against the
very same person who knocked him
out yesterday. He gave his rival no
chance with a volley of attacks at a fu-
rious rate scoring men quickly. As a
result, the teams drew in both wins
and points so Joseph, tired from the
last match, had to fight again in the
representative match. The rules were
first to score with no time limit so Jo-
seph once again had to unleash the
beast. This match lasted several min-
utes of intense fighting before Joseph
score the winning men cut.
Immediately afterwards we went
straight into the next match against
Edinburgh A. The first match was
over very quickly with Jason Li los-
ing two men in quick succession
against the Kyu-grade men’s cham-
pion. However, Adam evened it out
by winning his match with a men
cut. The next two matches were
close with both Yihan and Edward
putting up a good fight against their
more experienced opponents, which
resulted in another loss and another
win. Now once again Joseph had the
deciding match. Despite being tired,
as soon as his foe even twitched, he
scored a men strike. However, his ad-
versary managed to score back two
men strikes resulting in our overall
loss. Edinburgh A later on went on
to win the whole competition and
we came third so the outcome was
not too negative.
Joseph was also awarded with the
Best Fighting Spirit prize due to his
exceptional performance through-
out the entire championship.
Next up was the Dan-grade team
hoping to follow in the success for
the Kyu team. Unfortunately for
them they had to face the eventual
winners of the competition, Ed-
inburgh (again), at their very first
round. But by no means were they
simply pushed over, fighting with
great determination and spirit losing
only two matches out of five.
Next year the Taikai will be held
at the University of Gloucestershire
in the tranquil town of Cheltenham.
Tranquil, that is, until the masses of
shinai-wielding students descend
upon it and start shouting their bat-
tle cry ‘men’, which will definitely
liven up the town. That will also be
when we get our own back onEdin-
burgh (and all the other teams) and
win.
‘MEN!’
IC KENDO
Fulham v Chelsea
Felix Magath has no settling-in time at
Craven Cottage and with local brag-
ging rights at stake, Fulham should
give Chelsea a game here, especially if
they are still weary from their trip to
Galatarasay midweek. But the Blues’
class should prevail over the 90 min-
utes.
Prediction: 0-2
Tottenham v Cardiff
(Sunday 4:30)
After defeat at Norwich last week-
end, Tim Sherwood’s Spurs have to
keep winning to keep alive any linger-
ing hopes of a top 4 finish. The Blue-
birds are not showing the character-
istic spirit relegation battlers need to
survive at the moment. That has to
change, and fast.
Prediction: 2-0
Everton v West Ham
The Toffees might struggle to create
chances here as Sam Allardyce will get
10 men behind the ball and play the
long ball game up to a lone striker. But
they should make the breakthrough
at some stage, certainly if Romelu Lu-
kaku is back fit.
Prediction: 1-0
