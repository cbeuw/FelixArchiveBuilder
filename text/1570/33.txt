Time to hack away
Got an idea that might change the world or a new
user experience? Have you thought about hackathons?
A
hackathon is a weekend
long burst of creative
energy! It can be a mix
of app development,
product design,
making prototypes, building software
and solving cool problems. Basically
it involves bringing something useful
or cool into the world! This can be a
product, service, or even artwork,
there are lots of different kinds of
hackathons. Such events are open to
coders of all kinds and levels, being
allowed to unleash their creativity on
anything they could imagine.
Why should you attend? Because
it’s an unforgettable experience and
probably the most productive 24
hours you will ever have... you will
make friends; and who knows, maybe
build the next most downloaded app!
Last year, I organised the UK’s first
female-only student hackathon at
Facebook London, this article might
give you a taste of what that experience
was like: http://bit.ly/N79asz.
There is student hackathon
happening on 7-9 March – 7 March
is ideation, devices and team building
session, the actual hackathon the
8-9th) for both male and female
students which will allow everyone to
get their hands on devices like Google
Glass, Pebbles, Fitbits and much more.
There will also be an 1-hour
“Introduction to Hackathons” session
on 5 March in Huxley 340 (no need to
sign up for this).
We cannot wait to see you all there!

City and Guilds
Week impending
Carol Ann Cheah

GCU, the engineering
constituent union, are
kicking off their inaugural
C&G Week this coming
Monday. From the 3rd till
the 7th of March they’ll be hosting a
variety of mini-games on the Queen’s
Lawn every lunchtime (excluding
Wednesday). Engineers will have the
chance to win participation points for
their department, with daily prizes on
offer for the department that racks up
the most points for each day’s event.
A free bar night is up for grabs for the
overall winning department.
The event is a chance for engineers
to catch a bit of mid-term fun and
get to know some of their fellow
coursemates/faculty-mates – but of
course, non-engineers are welcome to
spectate!
To participate in any of the games,
all you have to do is turn up to the
Queen’s Lawn at 12pm on each game
day (excluding Tug of War, where
signing-up instructions will be sent
out by your friendly neighbourhood
reps.) See you there!
