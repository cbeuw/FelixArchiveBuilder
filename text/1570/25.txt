The opening of George Clooney’s
latest directorial effort (which is also
his latest acting, writing, producing,
and probably anything else you can
think of job) achieves the interesting
feat of being somehow both incred-
ibly evocative – not just of World War
II, but also of the whole generation of
war movies that followed – while also
being somewhat flat. It’s a weird feel-
ing, and – unfortunately – it’s one that
persists for the majority of the film.
It’s accompanied by the film’s habit
of feeling almost schizophrenic in
places, as if it’s not quite sure what
kind of film it wants to be. Things
start off as you’d expect (particularly
if you’ve seen any of the trailers), all
blustering patriotism, inoffensive
jokes and a healthy dose of camarade-
rie – basic training actually prompts
a few laughs, which sounds like a re-
ally backhanded compliment now I
think about it. Most of the humour
falls a little flat – there aren’t really
many actual laughs outside of basic,
even though there are clearly mo-
ments where laughter is expected –
and things such as the running ‘joke’
about Matt Damon’s character’s ap-
palling grasp of the French language
are smirk-worthy the first time and
then almost immediately over-used
and run into the ground.
And then the shooting starts. This
is a fairly bloodless war film (certainly
no Saving Private Ryan), but it still at-
tempts to make some efforts to show
the violence of war. It stumbles where
Spielberg’s War Horse soared, but it
does at least try. Unfortunately, when
coupled with the earlier attempts at
comedy (attempts which continue in-
between the fighting), it leaves the film
feeling uneven, uncertain of whether
it wants to maintain the light-hearted
tone or abandon it in favour of some-
thing altogether more serious. Cer-
tainly, the message (which is repeated
approximately fifty million times
throughout the film) about how cul-
Not so monumental
ture – how art – helps define a people
and how destroying that destroys the
memory of those people is a powerful-
ly true one, but when coupled with the
vague lack of seriousness that perme-
ates much of The Monuments Men it
ends up feeling like background noise.
Then there’s the fact that all this is
accompanied by a complete lack of
nuance, and not just in the over-riding
message. This is an incredibly black-
and-white film, with no room to make
any distinction between the fact that
the Monuments Men and the Allies
are good, and the Nazis are bad. The
closest the film ever gets to adding in
a shade of grey is by pulling off a weird
mid-point shift in ‘who the enemy is’
and instead adopting Cold War lean-
ings, as the Russians become the en-
emies for the protection of the stolen
art. It’s abrupt, jarring but does at
least make some sort of sense, lend-
ing a rather strong ‘race against time’
element to proceedings that serves to
pick up the pace from wherever it was
hiding in the first half of the movie.
That’s not to say it’s all bad – there
is emotion, and nuance, to be found
here, it’s just in the performances
rather than anything else. Continu-
ing the recent trend of banking on the
charisma of an all-star cast, The Mon-
uments Men does manage to produce
a few moments of genuine emotion,
particularly one (all too short) scene
with Bill Murray (although it pro-
ceeds to stomp all over that particu-
lar moment by cutting away to some
random dying soldier we have quite
literally never met before and so have
no reason to care about other than
the fact he’s dying), and you can’t help
but care about the fates of the Monu-
ments Men themselves, and will them
to succeed.
It’s just a pity that the rest of the film
can’t live up to its cast.
There are two things you should prob-
ably know about the fact that Mr Pea-
body & Sherman is a reboot/remake of
a kids’ TV show from years ago. The
first: as you may have guessed for the
vague-ness of that last sentence, I have
absolutely no clue what the TV show
was like other than it existed. So I’m
going in as blind as you possibly are
here. The second: it’s completely irrel-
evant here. This is a film that demands
to be taken on its own merits (which
is nice of it, I guess), and also one that
totally deserves it. Any history you
need to know (Mr Peabody’s a talk-
ing, hyper-intelligent dog, Sherman is
the human kid he adopted, we’re done
here) was either in those brackets or
is explained by Mr Peabody himself in
a delightful little opening monologue
(which is, for the record, preceded by
what is quite possibly the most surreal
short I have ever seen before a film,
and I’ve seen a lot of shorts before
films at this point).
From the chuckle-inducing opening
(weird short aside), the film manages
to maintain an impressively high gag
quotient for a film that’s been almost
exclusively billed as ‘for kids’, and a lot
of the jokes are pretty smart at that –
my personal favourite was an Oedipus
joke tucked away in a quick-fire rattle
through various quirky characters of
Greek mythology. It’s a disarmingly
sweet take on a significant chunk of
world history, serving that desirable
dual purpose teachers must adore:
educating and entertaining.
There’s not really a large amount else
to say about this film, in all honesty –
that smart, quick sense of humour is
easily the biggest attraction. The visu-
als are good quality, but in these days
that’s nothing to write home about,
while the plot itself is pretty good but
is rather flagrantly an excuse to shoe-
horn in as many parodies and histori-
cal jokes as humanly (caninely?) pos-
sible. It even squeezes in some rather
obvious (and mildly weird in places)
sentimentality too, but even that’s jus-
tified by a cute Spartacus joke. It’s also
apparently “more logical” than some
other recent film, but I think I laughed
while scribbling down that particular
comparison and it’s now just an il-
legible squiggle. So there you go. It’s
more logical than “psfhskgjsh”. What-
ever that is.
That’s not an accurate transcription,
for the record. Obviously.
Overall, then, Mr Peabody & Sher-
man is just great. But it’s just that.
An entertaining romp through his-
tory with enough to entertain kids and
grown-up kids alike.
