ast Friday an MSc
Management student, Miss
Tianlin Wang died. The
cause of Miss Wang’s death

This is a very tragic occurrence and
our thoughts are with Miss Wang’s

“With great regret, Imperial College
London confirms the death of one of

Imperial College Business School’s MSc
Management Programme.”

programme at Imperial College
Business School, said:
“This is very sad news for all of us who
knew and worked with Tianlin (Eve).
Our thoughts and sympathies go out
to all who are affected at this painful
time. Tianlin was an excellent and
conscientious student, with a bright
future ahead of her. Her legacy for us
all are her exemplar behaviour and
her smile, which we will miss every day
in our classrooms.

Management MSc
Student passes away
Miss Tianlin Wang a 2013-14 Management MSc student
at the Business School passed away last week.
A
team of 4 Imperial
students last week’s
student hackathon
hosted at Kings
University. The 4
computing students, Andrei-Loan
Cioara, Nandor Licker, Tomas Virgl
and Patrick Chilton took first place
in the UK’s first inter-university
hackathon, HackKings, where
they triumphed over teams from
Cambridge, UCL, Durham and
Oxford.
The teams were challenged to “create
something cool in 24 hours” and the
top three ideas won free mentoring
from Steer.me and a chance to pitch to
investors for £15,000.
Felix spoke to the winning Imperial
team, who told us:
“We decided to write LivMap as
we found there was a lack of tools
for finding a good area to live in. You
can find separate maps of rent, crime,
entertainment, travel, etc, but there
was no map that showed everything
according to your preferences. This
is exactly what LivMap is: you can
specify how much you value different
metrics (commute time to a given
place, crime rate, number of pubs),
and it instantly shows you a map with
rent adjusted for the other factors.
The competition was fun and
well-organized, though as usual at
Hackathons we were completely
exhausted by the end. We weren’t
aiming for the prize (we all have jobs/
internships lined up), we just wanted
to build something technologically
interesting and useful, so we were
blown away when they called our
name.
Technologically speaking I think our
solution was more sophisticated than
most of the other entries: the whole
map is computed in real time on the
