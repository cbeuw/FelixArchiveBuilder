More reasons to bee worried

here have been many
attempts to explain
the global decline of
bumblebees in recent years,
with blame often lying with
climate change or pesticides.
However, a recent article in
scientific journal Nature suggests the
problem might lie a little closer to the
hive. It appears that the cause could
be partially linked to their domestic
cousin, the honeybee.
Professor Mark Brown and his team
from Royal Holloway, University of
London have identified two separate
diseases that have potentially ‘spilled
over’ from honeybees into bumblebee
populations.
Deformed wing virus (DWV) – a
fungal infection which has previously
been shown to significantly shorten
the lifespan of honeybees – is now
presenting itself among bumblebees. It
is thought the disease passes back and
forth between the two species when a
bumblebee enters a plant previously
visited by an infected honeybee.
Assessing 26 sites across the UK, the
team were able to build on previous
levels of knowledge and determine an
idea of national numbers rather than
just local ones. However, co-author
Dr. Matthias Fürst warns that this
research is not definitive proof that
the disease is passed from honeybees
to bumblebees rather than vice versa.
Their suspicions only span from the
fact the disease is more prevalent in
honeybees.
DWV has been shown to
significantly shorten the lifespan of
honeybees and according to Prof.
Brown this will “impact massively on
their ability to go out to collect food
and look after other bees.” The effects
of DWV were present in 11% of the
bumblebees surveyed.
Not only will this have a noticeable
effect on bee populations worldwide,
but the knock on effects will have
considerable impact on our lives
too. Bumblebees are responsible
for pollinating ~70% of the world’s
flowering plants each year and
according to the Guardian, in the
US alone bumblebees provide $3bn
(£1.8bn) worth of crop pollination
annually. Preventing the further
spread of this disease is therefore of
extreme importance.
Don’t panic too much though, as Dr
David Aston – president of the British
Beekeepers Association (BBKA) – has
stated that the key to prevention of
most diseases in bees lies with good
husbandry skills. The onus therefore
D
iagnosis and treatment
of cancer often involves
some of the most
damaging procedures
that doctors would ever
intentionally inflict upon a human
body. The effects of chemotherapy,
for instance, are notorious, but
radiation from treatment or scans
can sometimes be just as harmful to
a patient’s health. A study published
in the Lancet this week proposes a
new technique that could completely
eliminate the radiation dose from
scans used to investigate tumours.
It could well improve outcomes for
many vulnerable patients, and even
save lives.
When determining the best
treatment options, doctors need
detailed information on a tumour’s
size and location, and whether it has
spread to any other parts of the body.
A common way to find this out is with
a PET-CT scan. This type of imaging
involves injecting a radioactive drug
into a patient which highlights tissues
that are more active than normal,
suggesting the presence of a tumour.
At the same time, a normal CT scan
is performed to analyse the sites that
have been highlighted.
A single PET-CT scan can give a
radiation dose equivalent to more
than 700 chest X-rays – about 4-6
times the background dose an average
person would experience over a whole
year. While these levels are unlikely
to cause any serious long-term effects
in adults, they could potentially be
extremely harmful to the sensitive
tissues of a child.
A much more attractive option
would be MRI. It has been widely
used in medicine for many years,
and involves imaging tissues using
radio waves in a powerful magnetic
field – without the need for harmful
radiation. Unfortunately, despite its
many uses, on its own it is unable to
distinguish between cancerous and
healthy tissues, and so has not been
widely used in this type of cancer
diagnostics.
The new research from scientists
at Stanford University has found a
way around this problem. The team
used a common iron supplement as a
contrast agent to highlight tumours, as
they found that it only gets absorbed
by healthy tissues, and shows up
clearly on the MRI. And unlike other
contrast agents that have previously
been tested, this drug stays in the body
long enough for detailed images to be

Not only does this technique
achieve the same results as the PET-
CT scan but without the radiation
dose, it also uses scanners already
common in hospitals, and a well
tested, freely available drug. If
further investigation confirmed the
technique’s effectiveness, it could be
rolled out relatively easily in many
hospitals around the world.
