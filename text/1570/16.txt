Medics are On The Razzle!
A
couple of weeks ago,
the producers of ICSM
Drama’s upcoming
production, On the
Razzle, sat down with
the cast and crew for a ‘Hollywood-
style interview’ about the making of
the play. Not really knowing what a
‘Hollywood-style interview’ was, it
quickly spiralled into a conversation
about life, the universe, and Asda.
Elvin: Director
Tommy, Ishani and Kanch: Producers
Chippy: Technical Director
Peter: Artistic Director
Abi: Costumes
Everyone else: Cast
Elvin, tell us what this play is about.
ELVIN: I’ve always described this
play as ‘Ferris Bueller’s Day Off in
1900s Vienna.’ I think that’s quite
apt. It’s about two shop assistants,
Christopher and Weinberl, who take
advantage of their boss Zangler’s
absence to escape to the big city
for one last adventure. Meanwhile,
Zangler’s niece Marie decides to elope
with her lover Sonders, but they all
end up crossing paths anyway. It’s a
classic farce.
How are rehearsals going?
ELVIN: Rehearsals are good. I feel like
we’ve been doing more than we have
before. But it’s an incredibly wordy
play, and there’s a lot of dialogue to
memorise.
RIJ: And there’s a lot of wordplay in
the wordy play. [Groans all around]
ELVIN: I’ve always believed that
repetition breeds familiarity, so really,
we just run through scenes over and
over again in the hopes that some of
this dialogue will stick.
So, Rij, can you tell us a little bit
about what it’s like to be the star of
the show during a fairly hectic term?
RIJ: Busy. I’ve had no time for
anything else… I’m kind of trying to
do medicine on the side a little bit, but
it’s been a struggle. No, it’s been really
good though.
Actors, who is your acting
inspiration?
RIJ: Qamar.
YATHU: Christian Bale.
ISHANI: I’ll go for the slug woman in
Monsters, Inc.
JESAL: Heath Ledger and Gollum.
GEN: My acting inspiration would be
Ishani.
ABI: I would have to go with Ishani as
well.
TOMMY: Ralph Fiennes, because
I was taught by the same guy who
taught him.
ABARIS: Schwarzenegger.
RIJ: Actually, can I change mine to
Ishani?
Tommy, Gen, some of the scenes
in this play could potentially be
awkward. How have you dealt with
the scenes that might be out of your
comfort zone?
TOMMY: What are you talking about?
JESAL: Snogging!
TOMMY: There’s a lot of intimacy.
ELVIN: How do you approach it as an
actor, because it must be challenging,
right?
TOMMY: You just talk it out
beforehand and set the ground rules:
absolutely no eye contact. My advice
would be to be very firm and proper
in your approach. Don’t look like you
enjoy it.
ELVIN: I’m feeling a little hot under
the collar.
TOMMY: You don’t want to give the
audience the wrong impression. Make
it very clear that there is a friend zone.
I would like to point out that it does
take two to tango in this… relationship
dynamic.
GEN: I’m just a very awkward person
so I was very awkward when I was
approaching it all, I remember. Now
I’m okay with it – I remember before I
was like, “Oh my God”.
Chippy, what does Tech actually do?
I’ve been dying to find out.
CHIPPY: So at the beginning of the
term, we sat down with Elvin and
discussed what he wanted, how he
wanted the stage to look. Then we
worked out how to make it look like
that – what he wants on stage – with
the lights we’ve got.
So what other challenges have you
had with tech so far?
CHIPPY: This year has been very
difficult to get other people to help
out.
And if people are interested in
helping you, how do they go about
doing that?
CHIPPY: They can e-mail me! At
ac3912. Or they can Facebook me. I’m
the only Chippy.
Kanch, you are a producer. Tell us
about the producing experience.
JESAL: Yeah, what does a producer
even do?
KANCH: Elvin gets the glory, and we
order the T-shirts.
ELVIN: Can you try not to sound so
resentful, please? But seriously, what
made you want to be a producer?
Because you’re right, it’s a very
unglamorous role. People give you
shit, constantly.
ISHANI: Well, it requires you to be
involved, and to make things happen.
And Kanch and I like to make things
happen.
KANCH: We do. We’re doers.
ISHANI: We’re the dream team.
Now, Tommy, you are the senior-
most producer; you’ve done this
before. Ishani and Kanch are the
rookies. What is the best advice
you would impart on someone who
wants to be a producer?
TOMMY: Just be ready to do anything
(within boundaries). It’s a very
encompassing role. Be on the other
end of the phone, be prompt with
e-mails. These guys have been really
good. Having done it last year and this
year, it’s been equally fun.
ISHANI: [looking over at Kanch] One
thing to work on is spelling our names
correctly in e-mails.
Peter, what are the challenges of
being Artistic Director?
PETER: When I first saw the script,
I thought uh-oh because I counted
five or six different scenes; interior,
exterior, shop outside, shop inside, flat
inside, flat garden, restaurant – all of
which are completely different.
ISHANI: I do remember you telling
me about this. You looked like you
were about to cry.
PETER: Elvin wiped my tears. We
had to get a bit creative, but we
brainstormed ideas together. We sat
down, had a heart to heart – it was
quite romantic… wait… where am I
going with this?
ELVIN: It’s a really ambitious set, with
a lot of moving parts. I don’t think
we’ve ever attempted something like
this before.
Abi,we’venotheardfromCostumes.
Tell us about Costumes.
ABI: There is a lot of tartan.
ELVIN: Why is there a lot of tartan?
ABI: It’s SO cheap!
KANCH: Fair enough, I guess that’s
one way of doing costumes.
ABI: It’s £3.50 a metre, which is really
very cheap for fabric. We have tartan
cloaks, which looks a bit like Red
Riding Hood. Um… Costumes is fun?
We sit in Reynolds and sew.
TOMMY: What do you do while
you’re sewing?
ABI: We play music, and usually we
gossip. It’s really good fun. We’re nice.
We’re lovely! Please come and join us
– Diana and I are always there. Kanch
sometimes joins us. Significant sewing
experience is not required. Diana is a
very patient teacher. I am not, but
that’s not the point. We’ve got Diana
so it’s fine!
Gen, as a fresher coming into this
society – what’s your experience
The Producers
ICSM Drama Society
been like so far?
GEN: It’s been a lot of fun. It’s just a
lovely community.
ELVIN: Did you do drama before?
GEN: No, only in primary school.
Secondary school was only musicals,
and I can’t sing, so…
ISHANI: What inspired you to join
us? Was it me?
GEN: I was interested in drama. I did
really enjoy it in primary school.
TOMMY: Based on what you’ve
experienced so far, would you do it
again?
GEN: Of course, I haven’t gone
through a play week yet but I really
enjoyed Freshers’ Plays.
CHIPPY: I always think play week
is the best, mainly because that’s the
only time I actually do something.
What is the one best thing about
play week?
RIJ: The best thing is opening night, I
think. It’s the first time you go onstage
and the first time anyone will watch
what you’ve been working on for
months. It’s terrifying but at the same
time it’s really good.
ABS: I’d say the last night, actually.
You get to have fun with it. You’ve
worked on it for months, trying to
perfect it and then you get to release
all the ideas you’ve had about how to
make it funny.
ABI: I quite like the dress rehearsal,
because having done the costumes it’s
good to see that everyone has one. No
one has to be onstage naked, which is
always good to see.
ELVIN: I like the ‘move in weekend’
– can I say that? It’s when everyone
comes together for the first time. The
cast meets the crew and there’s a sense
of camaraderie; you’re all working
towards a common goal. Is that really
lame?
TOMMY: It is.
So why should people come to see
this play?
TOMMY: It’s fucking hilarious.
ISHANI: Clever wordplay, the
charisma of the cast…
KANCH: The script, the actors, all
that tartan.
CHIPPY: We have T-shirts.
ICSM Drama’s On the Razzle runs
from March 5th-8th at the Union
Concert Hall. Doors open at 7pm.
