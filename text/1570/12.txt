Confessions of a GTA: Part 13
The GTA
Anonymous
This week the GTA describes the doom of the non-believer
I
n GTA work, a lot depends
on trust from your student.
Sometimes this simply depends
on perceived authority, i.e. you
are older and wrinklier than
them and you’ve been introduced
by their lecturer, therefore you must
know something, right? The nicest
times are when it depends on a
relationship built up over several
sessions when a student really believes
through your umming and ahhhhing
that you will be able to help them,
well… eventually.
These are the best kinds of students
because even if you don’t know the
answer straight away they believe
in you enough they will give you
the ‘benefit of the doubt’. This is a
precious thing for a GTA. I teach
on around four classes a week on
average. This can add up to hundreds
of questions. With maximum one
hour of preparation time to make the
session worth the cash, it means that
at the drop of a hat, I probably will not
remember one question from another.
Thus, that question that the students
have been ripping their hair out over
for weeks, I have probably seen for, at
maximum, two minutes.
I do understand the frustration.
These questions are occasionally
impossible until you have seen the
answer. I remember those days where
I just had to know what the heck
was going wrong with my work right
now, if not 2 days ago. However, I
have found the students who give
me a grace period of 2 seconds get
a far more coherent answer, even
sometimes in sentence form.
Yet what a GTA fears most is the
loss of this trust. If you take a fraction
of a second too long to answer, or you
come out with something initially
that the student was not expecting,
that’s it. They become a non-believer.
No matter how well you explain it
afterwards or how brilliant your
diagramis,theydonotcare.Itbecomes
like an awkward conversation in a bar.
They keep looking around you to see if
they know somebody, anyone else so
they can get the hell out of there.
Today, I explained a question, from
first principles, using a rigorous
mathematical proof. The student did
not believe me because he could not
‘imagine’ it to be that way. The proof
was there right in front of him, maybe
not beautifully explained but at least
written down. When he asked the
same answer to the lecturer, they
answered, and I quote, “because it is”.
Quite literally three words and the
student accepted it. Three words.
Therefore my confession for this
week: give your GTA the benefit
of the doubt. Even if they look like
a bumbling fool for the first three
minutes, they might surprise you.
R
ecently the Imperial
College chess team arrived
back from BUCA. After
multiple rounds, Imperial
managed to dominate
the entire tournament. It was a great
weekend of fun and exciting chess
games. However, throughout the
event, one thing particularly struck
me. Of a group of more than a 70
people, I could have counted the
number of women at this entire event
on two hands, maybe even one. Yet
on average, men and women are
distributed fairly evenly throughout
the globe. The ratio of the two genders
is close to 1:1. Why was it something
like 15 to one at this tournament? After
I got home I did my own research into
this and found some really astounding
facts: no woman has ever been world
champion; there are only 30 women
who are full Grandmasters (when
there are actually 1,192 GMs); and and
and. The list goes on and on. Women
are woefully underrepresented in this
famous game. Why is chess considered
such a mans sport?
Let us first get all the rubbish out
of the way: it does not require any
dexterity, strength or speed – only
your own brain power. Men and
women are not different in any way
if we just measure them by their
intelligence. Therefore, there should
be no reason why as many women as
men shouldn’t compete at all levels.
Throughout the early stages of
chess, e.g. the middle ages, chess
was played by women and men alike.
However, somewhat inexplicably, as
time progressed this ancient game was
more and more dominated by men.
Furthermore in the 19th and 20th
centuries, roughly 5% of tournament
players have been of the fairer sex.
In addition, and this is what I find
the strangest, FIDE (the world chess
organisation) introduced specific
woman’s titles. So, for example, you
have a normal GM, which is highest
attainable title in chess, and then you
have a Woman Grandmaster. Not only
do we have a distinct title, but to add
insult to injury, the requirements for
attaining one are much easier. It is as if
FIDE is saying that, yes women can be
GMs, but they need to be separate and
mean less than a normal GM.
This attitude that men and women
need to be judged differently in this
sport is the crux of the problem. Yes,
I agree that in some sports it makes
sense to have different competitions,
ranking etc. but why in chess?
Another aspect that I believe hinders
women into getting chess as much
as men is the the general perception
of chess players. Since chess is the
ultimate logical sport, men are seen
as the best gender as they are, oh, so
much more logical, just like in the
STEM subjects. I mean honestly, if
I asked you on the fly right now, to
name five women who were a great
chess players, you would stumble a bit
(hopefully you could name five chess
players though!). This ‘public opinion’
has also lead to less encouragement
by parents, sponsors and clubs to try
and get women to actually try playing
chess.
As an avid chess player, I think it is
quite sad that such a significant part of
the population does not get as much
support to try playing chess. The
wealth of talent that probably goes
wasted is a crime. I believe that there
isn’t a more equal game, where two
human beings, independent of gender,
age or origin can play a fair game, so
why not let all have a go at it?
