Consult ICG for productive summer experiences
A
s we arrive at Imperial,
many of us have a
quite vague idea of
what careers we want
to pursue at the end
of our degrees. We often consider
the professions directly linked to
our courses (engineers, scientists,
physicians, etc.) as well as other
popular industries such as finance.
However, the years spent at Imperial
offer several opportunities to widen
our horizons and explore alternative
careers, before we are walking around
the crowds at careers fairs in our
final year. Last week, Imperial hosted
the Internships Careers Fairs to help
students land placements, which are
a great way to gain valuable work
experience as well as explore whether
you will really enjoy the careers you are
considering. However, there are more
opportunities around to gain business
experience during your studies.
The Consultancy Society at
Imperial has a consulting arm called
the Imperial Consulting Group
(ICG). It is a completely student-run
organisation that takes on interesting
consulting projects (typically 4 weeks)
throughout the year to offer you
invaluable business experience. The
focus is on working with technology
companies as well as doing social
impact work, leveraging the skills
and resources available at Imperial.
The Imperial College Business School
has been particularly supportive,
providing both project leads as well as
training.
This makes for a remarkable
combination of skills, according
to Angela Dalrymple, Programme
Director at Imperial College Business
School. Angela has extensive
consulting industry experience
from PricewaterhouseCoopers,
and facilitates Imperial student
consultancy project coaching: “ICG
is an incredibly impressive group of
talented individuals from across the
Imperial student base. The group
continues to showcase best practice
in combining the knowledge and
skills of students from departments
such as engineering, computing and
the business school, and consistently
delivers stellar consulting projects
to a range of clients. Having worked
with ICG on projects ranging from
global automotive manufacturers
through to world-leading technology
organisations such as Inmarsat, I can
honestly say that ICG produce project
deliverables which are of equal value
to those of top consulting firms.
Joining ICG is a must for any Imperial
student interested in a fast-paced
career in consulting.”
ICG has worked with eight
different clients so far and has
many more projects in the pipeline.
While operations and strategy work
is preferred, the key criterion of
selecting projects is whether the work
will be interesting and valuable for the
participating students. As each project
is concluded, the recommendations
put forward by the teams has made a
real impact on the way clients do their
business, which is very rewarding to
be a part of.
Examples of projects
IEE
IEE is a global leader in automotive
safety, employing 1,600 and having
revenues of €160m. It had recently
been acquired by a set of international
investment groups, opening up
the opportunity for IEE to redefine
themselves and expand the business.
The team from ICG were asked to
assess the current market position of
IEE and suggest how it could continue
growing in a 10-year time frame. This
included exploring new markets for
IEE to address.
The ICG team formulated four
Wassif Shabbir
President -
Imperial Consulting Group, under
IC Consultancy Society
hypotheses for what markets IEE
should be present in a decade from
now. This involved a thorough survey
of the automotive sensors market,
exposing gaps that IEE are suited
to address, as well as attractive
markets for diversification. Apart
from exploring specific markets the
team assessed the impact of larger
industrial trends (such as the arrival
of semi-autonomous vehicles) and
the opportunities and threats that it
presented to IEE. The team also made
a recommendation on the balance
the business needs to strike between
their focus on automotive and non-
automotive markets. The work and
recommendations were presented
to senior management at the IEE
headquarters in Luxembourg. Many
of the recommendations have since
been pursued.
BBOXX
BBOXX is a for-profit spin-off from
a student-led charity at Imperial called
e.quinox. The focus of e.quinox is
to design and construct solar kiosks
in rural communities throughout
Africa. BBOXX aims to expand on
this mission by developing innovative
methods of distributing renewable
energy (i.e. portable solar products)
to the bottom of the pyramid in
developing countries and is aiming
to deliver electricity to 20 million
people by 2020. The consumer-base
of BBOXX is predominantly in Africa
and manufacturing is based in China.
With a franchise network covering 14
countries (increasing to 20 countries
by 2014), ICG was asked to explore
suitable locations from where BBOXX
could operate from in the future.
The ICG team identified 17 potential
locations to investigate based on key
metrics. Thereafter each candidate
location was assessed according
to both financial (office costs,
accommodation costs, travel costs,
tax regimes favourable to high growth
businesses, etc.) and non-financial
(quality of life, access to transport,
etc.) factors. The study produced a
model that assessed each candidate
quantifiably based on collected
data and solid assumptions. This
analysis allowed the team to narrow
the candidates to 4 locations, which
were investigated more thoroughly.
Finally, the top-scoring location was
recommended and the model was
delivered to the client.
Why should I join?
There are many reasons to
participate in the projects, whether
you are interested in a career in
consulting or not. The projects allow
you tackle real problems outside the
controlled environment of academic
studies in a team. Not only is this fun
and satisfying, but the recruiters of
almost any industry will be impressed
as well. If you are considering a career
in consulting you will also have the
opportunity to find out whether it’s
something for you or not. Having
participated in multiple projects,
you will also have the opportunity to
lead the projects and manage client
relations.
Yingkun Hou is a final year
Chemistry student who is involved
in his second project: ”My experience
at ICG has truly been amazing. It has
helped me develop a range of skills that
can directly be applied in the field of
consulting, and has played a vital role
for me in getting an offer from a well-
established consulting firm. I would
definitely recommend anyone with an
interest in consulting and business to
take part in future projects.”
Lorraine Choi is a second year EEE
undergraduate who has participated
in three projects: “ICG projects gave
me valuable hands-on experience
in the industry, which helped me to
identify my career interest. I would
definitely recommend my friends who
are interested or curious about what
consultancy is like to join a project!”
