Healthcare Trust, which
runs five London hospitals
including St Mary’s
and Charing Cross. has
announced the appointment of a
new Chief Executive. High profile
Australian healthcare administrator
Dr Tracey Batten will take up
the position at the start of April.
This follows the resignation last
October of Mark Davies, who was
widely credited with making large
improvements to the Trust’s financial
situation. The post of interim Chief
Executive has since been jointly held
by former medical director Professor
Nick Cheshire and former chief
financial officer Bill Shields.
Dr Batten attained a medical
doctorate from the University
of Melbourne. She practiced
medicine at both the Aberdeen
Royal Infirmary and Bart’s Hospital
London. She later gained Master’s
degrees in Healthcare Management
and Business Administration from
the University of New South Wales
and Harvard. She has extensive
experience of running large medical
organisations –having been head
of dental services in the Australian
state of Victoria, later moving on
to run the Eastern Health group
of hospitals. Her latest position
was Chief Executive of St Vincent’s
Health Australia. With some 16,000
staff and a budget of £1 billion, it is
the largest non-for-profit healthcare
and research organisation in the
country. A recent survey showed
that, during her tenure, over two
thirds of St Vincent’s staff agreed that
it was “a truly great place to work”.
Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of
the Trust, said that the Trust had
“conducted an exhaustive, global
search for our new chief executive”
and that he was confident that it
had “found the kind of aspirational
and inspirational leader we were
looking for”. He praised Br Batten
abilities, saying: “She has a strong
record of clinical and managerial
leadership and the organisational
transformation she achieved at St
Vincent’s Health was particularly
impressive. I have always felt that

clinicians should be closely involved
in the management and leadership
of NHS Trusts but the best clinical
leadership comes from those with
both clinical and managerial skills
and experience. Tracey Batten is
such a leader.”
This was a view shared by Professor
Dermot Kelleher, Dean of the Faculty
of Medicine at Imperial College
London, who said that he believed
that “Tracey Batten will bring an
outstanding record of professional
achievement, exceptional leadership
skills and new perspectives to this
crucial job”.
Dr Batten will lead the Trust at a
time of change as it completes its
application to become a Foundation
Trust. This will give it autonomy
from the Department of Health,
giving members of the Trust greater
freedom in determining its policy.
Dr Batten indicated that she was up
to the new job, saying: “The prospect
of leading one of England’s largest
and most prestigious NHS Trusts
is both an honour and an exciting
challenge. I hope to bring fresh
ideas from another public health
system and to help Imperial College
Healthcare NHS Trust complete its
journey towards Foundation Trust
status. I am deeply committed to
ensuring not only the very best
clinical outcomes for patients but
that their wider experience of the
healthcare system is the very best
too. I look forward to meeting
my new colleagues and our many
patients in the near future.”
“[Dr Batten]

record of clinical
and mangerial
leadership and
the organisational
transformation
she achieved at St
Vincent’s Health
was ... impressive.”
J
ohn Downey, 62, was
a main suspect for the
murder of four soldiers by
the IRA (Provisional Irish
Republican Army) and has
now been let free due to a police error
that gave him effective immunity.
The Hyde Park and Regent Park
bombings occurred in 1982 and
resulted in the deaths of 11 military
personnel, four in Hyde Park and
seven in Regent’s Park. John Downey
had been wanted for over 30 years and
was finally arrested at Gatwick Airport
in May of last year for his apparent
role in the Hyde Park bombings.
However, it was found that John
Downey would not be prosecuted
after it emerged that he was given
a ‘letter of assurance’ that gave him
effective immunity from prosecution.
This was one of 187 letters send out by
the Government in 2007 as part of a
deal struck for the Northern Ireland
peace settlement.
These letters were given to ‘on the
run’ IRA suspects who had fled abroad
and wanted to return to Northern
Ireland and was wrongly sent to Mr
Downey because of a ‘catastrophic
failure’ by the police who failed to
notice a warrant for his arrest was still
outstanding for the bombings.
Although this letter was discovered
six years ago, the police continued
with the prosecution and now the
collapse of the case means that it is
highly unlikely that anyone will be
prosecuted over the bombings. Mr
Justice Sweeny threw out the case
after ruling that the letter of assurance
still stood even though it was sent to
the wrong person.
Relatives of the murdered soldiers
said they were ‘devastatingly let
down’ and placed blame on the Police
Service of Northern Ireland, who
knew that Mr Downey was wanted
over the Hyde Park bomb but did not
notify the authorities.
Peter Robinson, the Northern
Ireland First Minister, said Mr
Downey had been handed “a get out
of jail free card” and urged an appeal
against the decision.
