This week, you’re desperate to boost
flagging sales for your society’s event.
You send your members off to guerilla-
flyer the campus, and bug course-
mates to buy tix until you’re Facebook-
blue in the face. Nothing happens until
one of your posters ends up in the Cen-
tral Library’s men’s urinals…vandalized
withsnarkypenisremarks.Remarkably,
its 5 mins of fame on Facebook does
WAY more for your sales figures than
your last fortnight’s efforts altogether.￼
ThisweekyoufindoutthatWongKei,
where you got your first wallet-friendly
foodgasm, is changing manage-
ment and getting an attitude over-
haul too. You despair as you realize
you no longer have a reliable way to
continue your “extra credit” study of
crass Mandarin/Cantonese - there’s
only so much Horizons covers! Plus
the crunch from the unintentional fire-
ants was what made that prawn toast
extra-special-it’llneverbethesame...
This week you’re pulling an all-
nighter in the library, frustrated that
your efforts to give someone that
Metric Moment via the Lonely Hearts
column are going the same way as
your current coursework: nowhere.
You sigh, thinking how progress
would be easier if you had half the
wit of the Imperial Library Whiteboard
Message Mastermind. (Take it from
the females on Felix: it isn’t.)
This week, you’re majorly sleep-de-
prived in the Felix Office when the Editor
asks you to write the horoscopes. While
you’re used to always feeling out of your
depth at Imperial, you freak out majorly.
You spend the next hour spamming
the Refresh button on the Twitch Plays
Pokemonsubreddit,prayingthattheen-
lightened followers of Bird Jesus - and
the resurrected Lord Helix - will inspire
you. Pint?
This week you find that you have
beenturnedintoanelephant.Youare
then promptly whisked off to the West
End and forced to dance on stage
with the East Meets West cohort in a
riot of color. After collapsing during
what feels like the billionth verse of
JaiHo,youwakeuptofindthatitwas
all just a dream - and that your “(re-)
friend plox” requests on Facebook
have more than doubled overnight.
This week you win your department’s
annual Talent Show. While the girls in
your department throw their phone
numbers in your general direction,
you silently thank the missed hours of
CSP budgeting that martyred them-
selves during your absence in order
to ensure your victory.
This week, you’re so annoyed by all
of the Twitch Plays Pokémon memes
that you write to Felix to complain
aboutit.Peoplearesomovedbyyour
stirring letter that they go to Twitch’s
offices in San Francisco and burn
it down, ending the stream forever.
They even go as far as to treat the Fe-
lix letter that inspired this as the basis
ofanewreligion,consultingitatevery
opportunity. All hail the Felix Fossil!
This week, you change your allegiance
to the Dome Fossil - after being bribed
by the promise of unlimited Yoyo bal-
ance. Son, I am disappoint.
This week you make a ground-break-
ing discovery: the probability that Im-
perial’s print service will fail again is
dependent on how amicable CSPB’s
budgeting process is for the year. (Un)
fortunately the board get their shit to-
gether and pass most of the budget-
ing lines without much incident - be-
fore you have a chance to sufficiently
testthattheory.Chinup-therearebet-
ter ways to win that Nobel prize...
This week, you throw yourself (hurr)
into every RAG week event to absolve
your “guilt” of landing that banking job.
You wake up in Timbuktu, dressed in
a pink shirt stained with peri-peri sauce
+ Krispy Kreme glaze. Your return trip
consumes most of the Jailbreak pot,
overshadowing your “furthest travelled”
achievement - doubling the “greedy
money-grabber” guilt you were trying to
shake in the first place. Well, you tried...
Thisweekyou’refedupwithhowlong
your usual Union haunt takes to serve
their food, so you head to the JCR for
a change. Despite being cuter than
your overrated cousin Mickey, the
rest of Imperial deems your presence
unwelcome - ratting out your arrival
on the Imperial: Tell Someone Some-
thing page. But hey - College Cater-
ing can’t blame you for having good
taste now, can they?
This week you wake up to find your-
self meme-fied by a random com-
moner from the lower echelons of Im-
perial. Horrified, you order your butler
to bring some tipple from the family’s
wine cellar - only to find that Daddy
has barred your access due to the
atrocious 2.1 on your last lab report.
You weep at the thought of having to
resort to the local off-license before
your evening pheasant hunt. Becks?

Why should we vote
for you?
BEAT THIS CAPTION!
Putin relieved by end
of Sochi Games E
lectiontimeisalwaysajoyous
occasion, the one time when
people who normally ignore
you on campus start paying
attention to you and holding
the door open for you to pass. Yeah
right! We know exactly what you’re up
to. Do you think we haven’t noticed
your the sudden flurry of activity on
your facebook feed, twitter and google
plus?
Now, if you really want to get us to
vote for you, you have to a) Not be a
prick (male or female), b) Actually
have something useful to say, c) Don’t
just rely on “experience”. Have you read
this week’s Plugtime? Yeah, we know
that represents a large proportion of
candidates.
So, what makes you so special? Is it
your silly picture, your “pun-tastic”
slogan or your gimmicky posters?
We’ve decided to take a stand, we
are Hangman, we are many. If we
think you’re crap we’ll be running a
RON campaign so mad you wish your
name was Norris. Oh, wait, wrong
badass ginger dude. Don’t just waffle,
have some real points, or we’ll vote
for the better candidate and just RON
your ass!
You’ve been warned...
Can finally get back to watching new episodes
of How I Met Your Mother
F
ollowing the end of the 2014
Winter Olympic Games in
Sochi this week, Russian
President Vladimir Putin has
expressed relief that all of
his favourite American TV shows will
be returning, most notably the final
season of long-running sitcom How I
Met Your Mother.
“Finally I can find out just how Ted
meets The Mother!” President Putin
said in a statement from his private
pool, currently filled with millions of
rubles of laundered money from the
absurdly over-budget two-week event.
“I mean, we’re in the ninth fucking
season of this show. We’re like five
episodes away from the end and then
suddenly it’s gone for weeks because
of some stupid Olympics or whatever.
I’ve been waiting nine years to finally
see Ted hook up with this dream girl
of his and I can’t wait any longer!
“I just put on this absurd event
to embezzle billions of dollars out
of the Russian taxpayer’s purse for
myself and my oligarch buddies”, the
controversial public figure continued.
“But now it’s all over and all of my
shows are back. Now excuse me whilst
I go catch up on Supernatural!”
Putin then proceeded to download
the latest episodes of Supernatural,
Community and even The Musketeers
on The Pirate Bay.
“Ain’t got no ISPs blocking my Pirate
Bay, suckers!”
How I Met Your Mother was off the air
for a disgusting two weeks whilst the
games were going on :( Credit: CBS Email hangman@imperial.ac.uk to win a “leetle prize”
Dear Fresher Rohan, we think you might have
lost your certificate on Wednesday evening. Don’t
worry it’s safe in our office. If you want to get it
back you’ll have to write an article for us first :)
Oh, and just so you know, it’s not a real
qualification... might want to get your money back
;p
