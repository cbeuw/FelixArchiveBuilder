Ask Annie, your friendly Agony Aunt
Help! My parents told me last week
that they’re getting divorced. I feel
really helpless because I can’t go back
home to see them, and I’m dreading
going home for the holidays, because
everything will be different. I feel really
guilty that I can’t be there for my
parents, but I don’t know what I’d say
to them anyway. What should I do?
End of an Era in Embankment
It’s always tough when your parents
split up, but as a mature adult, you
should be able to see that if they’ve
made this decision, it’s probably for
the best. By making this decision
when you’re away, they’re probably
trying to minimise any impact that
the practicalities of separating have
on you, you don’t have to see it to the
bitter end. While you might feel like
you need to support them, they’ve
decided to do it this way, and you have
to accept that if they need anything
from you, they will ask for it. If you feel
like you need to talk to them about it
though, you need to bring it up with
them yourself.
Help! My lab partner has really bad
BO. He’s a really good lab partner
otherwise, but it makes working in a
confined area with him really difficult.
How can I gently suggest to him that
he needs to shower a little more often?
Nauseated in Neasden
If you had this problem, you’d want
to know about it, so it’s good that
you want to say something to him.
While he might not appreciate it
so much at first, he will thank you
for it eventually. Try and make
it seem like it’s a new thing, like
you’re mentioning it as soon as
it’s happened, to minimise his
embarrassment. It’s alright to play it
down, but don’t make too much of a
joke about it, or he might not realise
that you’re being serious.
Help! I’ve been using Tinder a lot
lately, and I’ve been talking to a guy
who wants to meet up. I really like him,
but I used a fake picture on my profile
so I don’t know how I can ever actually
meet him. What can I do?
Deceitful in Denmark Hill
It depends how different the picture
you chose is. If you’re a bit Ugly Betty
and you’ve chosen J.Lo, you might be
able to get away with pretending that
it’s just exceptional lighting. If you’ve
chosen a photo of Paris Hilton, even a
blonde dye job isn’t going to make that
convincing. If you can get away with
it, try sending him some pictures that
are halfway between the fake one and
you, and then gradually change them
to real pictures of you before you meet
up. If you don’t think that’s believable,
you can either confess and hope he
likes you enough to think it’s funny, or
just leave it, put a real photo on your
Tinder, and find someone else.
Help! My housemates have started
planning where they want to live next
year, and it’s assumed that we’ll live
together next year, wherever we go.
But I’m fed up of living with them, and
while I’m happy to put up with them
until the end of the year, how do I tell
them that I don’t want to live with
them next year?
Leaving in Limehouse
It’s important to let them know that
you don’t want to live with them next
year before they make any serious
plans. If you don’t tell them, they’ll
only find out through the grapevine
from the other people you’re planning
on living with. You don’t have to tell
them that you don’t like living with
them; pitch it as you really wanting to
live with the other people. If you let
them know now, they can’t be angry
that you’ve inconvenienced them, and
it will be a much nicer atmosphere for
the remaining time than if they found
out another way.
Help! I recently broke up with my long-
term girlfriend, and we’re trying to be
friends, but I’m still wishing that we
might get back together. I want to move
on and try and meet someone else, but
I’m scared to do anything that might
jeopardise my chances of getting back
with my ex. What should I do?
Hopeful in Holburn
As I wrote last week, it’s rarely a good
idea to get back with an ex. Although
it can be hard to completely let go of
an old relationship and finally move
on, if you’re starting to think about
relationships, you’ve gone most of the
way towards moving on. If you haven’t
gotten back together by this point,
the reasons that you broke up are
valid, and you probably won’t. Bite the
bullet and approach someone new,
you might be surprised how much
better it’ll make you feel.
1. Do it face to face
Unless you’re in a different country, or want to just get it
over with in the heat of the moment (because, for example,
you just found out that they were fucking your best friend),
you should always wait until you can meet face to face to
break up with someone, out of respect for them, and your
relationship.
2. Be honest
They’ll want the chance to argue their case, but don’t waver
here. Stay on task, and honestly explain to them why you’re
ending the relationship. In order for them to get over it,
they will need to know why it’s over, and you don’t want to
have to explain this to them over and over again. By doing
this honestly the first time, you save yourself a lot of time
and pain dragging things up time and time again.
3. Stay friends
At least throughout the awkward division of assets, you
should try and remain friends. You’ll find it really difficult
to immediately cut off your dependence on them anyway,
so for a while, you can try and gradually wean yourself off
them. It shows that you can be mature about it as well, so
any petty hard feelings won’t get aired in front of all your
friends.
4. Ignore them (work the double peaks)
Once you’ve got all the practicalities of the breakup out
of the way, you need to take some time away from them.
This space will allow you to get over them and recover from
the relationship in your own time. Every time you speak
to them, you’ll set back the process of getting over them.
Eventually, you might be able to be friends with them, and
your level of contact can increase again. For now, you need
to leave it be.
