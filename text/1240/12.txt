Who knows, we might even lis
The summer term is over - for most of you, at least - and you are
about a third of the way through the last Felix of term, so I'm
sure the last thing that you want to be thinking about is the fact
that in three month's time it all starts again, but I'm going to
anyway.
We want to make Felix even better next year, and the only way
that we can do that is to find out what you want from it. So just
fill out this questionnaire and hand it back to any security desk
or any of the Union bars - including Charing Cross, Silwood and
Wye - and you should start to see improvements from the very
first issue.
If that's not incentive enough, we've also got an absolutely
obscene number of free VIP paintballing trips to give away, so if
you send this back, and fill out the box at the end, then you've
got a fairly good chance of winning a trip for you and some
mates to go to any of three venues in the South East, be
equipped with semi-automatic weapons and get to run round in
the woods.
Anyway - on to the questions!
1. Do you think that there should be less, the same
amount, or more of the following:
