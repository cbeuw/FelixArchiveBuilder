Accommodation Sought
College officials are currently
involved i n negotiations that
could see external student
accommodation being leased
to Imperial to ensure it main-
tains its guarantee of hall
accommodation for all freshers
and first-year postgraduates
while Southside undergoes its
planned refurbishment.
The properties - sited on
Cromwell Road and Queens
Gate Gardens - are are owned
by a neighbouring academic
institution that may not
require their use for a period of
three or four years, potentially
freeing them up for use by
Imperial students. A s report-
ed earlier this term, the
College faces a potential crisis
over a lack of student bed-
spaces due to its plans to sell
Clayponds village i n Ealing
and that Southside halls are
due to close for a two-year
refurbishment project in the
autumn of 2003.
Felix understands that the
housing offered in these prop-
erties would be based on
accommodation licenses of 51-
weeks' duration, and so would
be most suitable for postgrad-
uates. The College would then
be able to use its own proper-
ties to offer undergraduates
accommodation for shorter
license periods.
Union President, Sen
Ganesh, told Felix that the
negotiations were still at a
very early stage, but the
College is working hard to
ensure that it offered sufficient
levels of hall accommodation.
Mr. Ganesh went on to say
that he had been assured that
the guarantee of accommoda-
tion for first year undergradu-
ate a n d postgraduate stu-
dents would be met.
Francis Warned
David Francis, Deputy
President for Education a n d
Welfare, w a s given a formal
written warning at this year's
last meeting of Union
Council.
Union President, Sen
Ganesh, was obliged to issue
the warning to Mr. Francis
due to the alleged libellous
content of a report that he
had submitted to Council i n
March. This followed a com-
plaint by Mustafa Arif, the
president of City and Guilds
College Union, and relates to
comments made b y Mr.
Francis regarding the issue of
the electronic L E Q system,
w h i c h many people allege
Mr. Arif tampered with.
Although most senior
Union figures believe that
these allegations are true, Mr.
Arif has not formally been
brought before a College dis-
ciplinary committee to
answer these charges, and as
such they remain unsubstan-
tiated.
A senior Union source said
that they thought that the
warning h a d "been a long
time coming," a n d that
"David Francis has been a
law unto himself for the
whole year, which is sympto-
matic of Sen Ganesh failing to
lead the Union or manage the
work of his deputies." It is
not known whether this view
is indicative of the views of
Council as a whole, as there
are other senior Union mem-
bers w h o believe the com-
plaint to be a waste of
Council time and more about
personalities than the issues
at hand.

Meanwhile, i n another
development, the Rector has
apologised over the w a y i n
which the news that
Clayponds village is to be sold
next year was released. The
decision to approve the pro-
posed sale w a s made before
consulting the student body,
and met w i t h an angry
response at a meeting of the
Union's Executive Committee
last month.
Mr. Ganesh told Felix that in
order to improve communica-
tion between the College, the
Union and its students regard-
ing matters of accommoda-
tion, a monthly meeting
between him, the Rector,
Deputy Rector and the
Director of Estates would now
take place "to ensure that stu-
dents are kept aware of devel-
opments."
