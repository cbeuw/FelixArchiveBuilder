Overseas Student Applications Up
The number of undergraduate
applications to British univer-
sities from Chinese students
has risen sharply in the last
year, according to official sta-
tistics released by the
Universities and Colleges
Admissions Service (UCAS).
The number of students
from China wishing to study in
the UK has increased almost
ten-fold in the last three years,
with an increase in applica-
tions of 69% this year. These
increases may be connected
with the fact that students
that come to Britain to study
from outside the European
Union pay much higher tuition
fees than those from within it,
and some believe that British
universities may be intention-
ally attracting overseas stu-
dents to help the funding cri-
sis currently prevalent in the
country's higher education
system.
While there have been wide-
spread decreases in the num-
ber of students applying to
British universities in the past
couple of years, mostly attrib-
uted to the abolition of grants
and the introduction of tuition
fees, applications have risen
by 2% across the nation as a
whole this year, with the
biggest increase occurring in
Scotland - at more than 5% -
where fees have been abol-
ished. In contrast, applica-
tions from under 21-year-olds
in England rose by just 0.1%.
A number of politicians have
suggested that this year's
minute increases in applica-
tion numbers has called into
question the likelihood of the
government meeting its target
of 50% of all those under 30
experiencing some form of
higher education by the year
2010. Speaking to BBC News,
The Liberal Democrat's
Education spokesman, Phil
Willis, decried the target as
now "little more than a pipe
dream," but the Higher
Education Minister, Margaret
Hodge, defended the Blair
'vision', citing that applica-
tions were now on the up after
an initial downturn following
the introduction of fees in
1998. She went on to say that
while there had been only a
0.1% increase in the number of
under 21-year-olds applying,
applications by 18-30 year-
olds had risen by 7.3%.
Meanwhile, a report pub-
lished by Universities UK
reported that the basic infra-
structure of the British Higher
Education system is in a state
of disrepair. The report esti-
mated that around Â£10bn of
funding needs to be found to
ensure that the buildings
owned by Higher Education
institutions across the country
coming to the end of their
intended lifespans remain safe
and usable.
