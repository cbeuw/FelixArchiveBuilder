Editorial
Hurrah! The last editorial that
a reasonable number of you
will ever read. Not the last one
I have to write, of course. No,
I have another year to go, but
for you lucky few, yes, you for-
tunate ones w h o will be
escaping the interminable
drivel of my mind, this is it.
So on to business. I have
been looking back in the past,
and there have generally been
many thanks bits and stuff
done by all the editors, and
some rambling, etc.
I'm not going to do that.
Firstly, I don't really believe in
selecting people when I know
I'll forget others who have
been more important; second-
ly because I have such a bad
memory for names that I can't
remember most of them; third-
ly, I'm much too lazy to have
to think about it that hard,
when all I really want to do is
go to bed, and fourthly I find it
all rather maudlin, and I've
always been rather b a d at
goodbyes. Especially w h e n
it's my friends who are leav-
ing, and not me.
This is the third year n o w
when I've had to say goodbye
to friends I've made at IC. I
suppose it's my own fault for
being here so long, and I sup-
pose I enjoy it on some level,
but in the end it is always sad
to have your friends moving
on around you, and for you to
be left alone like the nowhere
man at the end of that song by
the Beatles i n Yellow
Submarine. But I have met
and made friends with many
people I have felt very strong-
ly for, and it is sadly likely that
I will never see many of them
again. So to you I would like to
say that while I may not be
the most honest person about
facts, I am honest about feel-
ings, and I can promise cate-
gorically that I have never lied
to anyone about how I have
felt. If you leave this
University thinking I loved
you, then I most probably did.
Sorry about this rather
depressing turn, but up until
now I have been running
around wildly trying to get
things done, and it was only
once I started writing this
very column that I realised
that this was, as they say, it.
So yes. I realise that this
isn't a very terminal Felix. No
heartfelt goodbyes, and no
long winded rants about
things that have pissed me
off. This is possibly because
I'm not easily angered (at
least for long), and possibly
because I'm too lazy to bother.
Aside from all this, I would
like to ask all of you who are
moving on whether you feel
you've made the most of your
time here (and this coming
from someone who has possi-
bly made too much of his time
here). I hope you all feel that
strange feeling that I do of joy
and sadness combined when
you leave knowing (and I
realise I sound trite, but I'm
really not very poetic) that
something wonderful has
ended, that will hopefully be
replaced with something even
better.
I said I wasn't going to say
any thank-yous, but I'm hav-
ing trouble reaching the end
without mentioning some of
the people who have made
this year wonderful, so I will
do it with references. The ref-
erence doesn't necessarily
have to be about you, just as
long as you understand...
Love to all w h o get:
esquirol!, Champagne in the
morning, wagas, minkey, bag-
puss, Bitchmonkey, so many
chickens, Felix sofa chats,
lifestyle issues, kissmonster.
Be Seeing You...

Union
Events
Cheesy Wotsits
While most of us are
preparing to go home, a
few die-hard alcoholics
will still be down the
Union doing permanent
damage to their livers.
Hospital, Until Next Term
Nothing
Nothing has ever hap-
pened ever on a
Thursday. Fridays, as
you know, play a large
part in my downfall, but
Thursdays, nothing.

Spiderman
Go and see it. It's fun,
and slightly darker than
your average summer
blockbuster. Almost
gothic, i n fact. M m m ,
gothic. Reminds me of...
Gotham, I suppose.
Baise-Moi
Came out a while ago,
but annoyed people
because the title is rude
in French (literally 'kiss
me,' but it has 'other'
connotations) Violent

They're survivors, and

'We w a n n a get high,

forever echo around my
