E n d Of Year Carnage
If you haven't pulled all
year, (and you know
who you are) then this is
your last chance. Get
out there and find your
soul mate. It'll be fun.
Union, All Night
You'll Be Lucky
We're all going home.
You can look after your-
selves. In fact you can
come to Beit Quad and
bask in the fact that
there won't be people
playing football, badly.
More Of The Same
Again, I doubt that
much will be occurring.
It is the holidays, you
know, and postgrads
don't count. Yah Boo!
The bars will be open,
though. I hope.
Even I Won't Be Here
Hopefully I will have
done everything that
needs to be done, so will
be taking all my holiday
for the year over this
month. I might be in
America. Now you know.
Only A Term To Go
You must be so desper-
ate to get back to
College, if you've read
this far. Or maybe you've
got a job, and are dying
to be young again. Sorry,
but you're not. Haha.
There is so much poten-

Episode II
How arrogant just to
name a film 'episode ii'.
In order to bring it down
to size, I will from now
on refer to it in lower
case letters. Because it's
pretty dodgy.
Resident Evil
Yay. A film that is merely
about death and isn't
scared to admit it. Busty
women, big guns, and
less plot than Tomb
Raider. No? Well I'll
watch it....
Van Wilder
According to the Telly,
this is only National
Lampoon status
because they paid a
large wodge of cash to
refer to itself as such.
Pretty scary.
Snow Dogs
I don't know. Something
about a dentist and
some dogs. Sounds dis-
gusting to me, but your
little brother/sister
might like it, so perhaps
go with them.
Spirit
Ooh erry erry er. I really
can't think of anything
worse. Horse related
Western? Animated?
Pass me a bucket, and
call me Shirley, then bite
my bottom.

Secret Affair
In my opinion they never
last. But then what do I
know? Nothing, that's
what, and I'm proud. But
if you like these people,
go see them. Simple, eh?
Shepherd's Bush Empire
Glastonbury
It's big and muddy, with
lots of stoned people,
and some relatively
decent bands, some-
times. I would go if I
wasn't allergic to mud.
Somerset, The Weekend
Erm...
You must realise that
without serious research
of the variety that I don't
have time for, the
chances of anything
sensible being written
in here is minimal.
...Therefore
I'm just going to talk
tosh to fill up these
spaces, and reminisce
on the good old days
when Felix was just a
young kitten, and not
the sabre-toothed...
...Pussy
I present for your delec-
tation today. So enjoy it,
my friends. Make the
most of it, for one day it
will be old and wrinkled,
and will be of no use to
anyone. No, not even me.
