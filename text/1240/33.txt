club active
Last week I was fortunate to
be present at an event which
actually took place - strange I
know, for these pages - but the
nature of which you will find
hard to believe. It was a sur-
prisingly pleasant afternoon,
and I found myself looking out
over some of the greener parts
of London with one of IC's few
predominantly female clubs,
all of them brandishing whips
and many clad in long, leather
boots.
This was, in fact, the riding
club's inaugural annual show
jumping competition, held at
the London Equestrian Centre
in Mill Hill last friday, the four-
teenth of June.
The competition was spilt
into three categories - begin-
ner, novice and open - and
although there w a s a strong
Equestrian Antics
showing i n the latter classes
only one beginner turned up
on the day. I feel that it is my
responsibility to warn the
others of the fate
that awaits them
when they return
to College, but
instead I will just
recommend that
they leave the
country. Now. Forever.
First up in the competi-
tion were the novices,
jumping over a spacious
course of 2 foot fences.
After hard work by all
concerned a n d a few
moments of silliness
Gemma - the organiser,
who only stepped in to ride at
the last minute - won. Shona
came i n second, Natalie w a s
close behind in third followed
by Ruth M and Harriet.
The open class jumped the
same course, but w i t h the
fences raised. This class
rather than being a sim-
ple, timed, clear round
was split into two sec-
tions. Initially all the
competitors d i d one
round of the course,
and those who complet-
it successfully proceed-
ed into the jump off.
Nicola and Rachel made it
through to the jump off,
after Jess a n d A n n a
picked up a number of
faults and refusals in the
first round, with Ruth C's
horse unfortunately trip-
ping and falling at the penulti-
mate fence and unseating her.
You will be pleased to know,
however, that the running of
the Union is not in jeopardy as
she escaped w i t h nothing
more than a few bruises, and
the horse too received no seri-
ous injuries.
The jump off proceeded as
planned and after excellent
rounds by both, Nicola was
deemed to have beaten Rachel
by the narrowest of margins.
The afternoon was conclud-
ed with the beginners' class,
which was won in some style
by Karim, after a very convinc-
ing ride.
Many thanks must go to
Gemma for such a well run
competition, and let's hope
that there are many more to
come.
