Teddington: likely to be sold during the summer vacation
continued from page 15
December
The first round of College-wide
web-based Lecturer
Evaluation Questionnaires
went online. David Francis, the
Deputy President for
Education and Welfare, prom-
ised in a Felix article that "this
time it's as robust as a tank
built by the A-Team."
Unfortunately, the scheme
failed to run entirely to plan,
with security breaches and
student apathy ruining the
organisers' attempts to get a
representative sample of stu-
dent opinion.
Felix reported that students
from the Department of
Computing had uncovered
security flaws that one "could
drive Texas through," casting
serious doubts on the validity
of any survey carried out using
the system. Worse still, the
engineers in charge of con-
structing the system had been
advised of these security prob-
lems a year ago.
January
A confidential College docu-
ment confirmed that the
Teddington sports ground is
likely to be sold during the
2002 summer vacation.
Unsurprisingly, most medics
are upset by the proposals.
Aside from the question of
70 years of tradition, the major
argument against the develop-
ment of these grounds is the
superior quality of the land;
Teddington is regarded as one
of the best sports pitches in
the South of England.
Work began on the £27m
Tanaka project, which will see
the construction of a brand
new site for the College's
Business School on its
Exhibition Road fagade. The
project was made possible by
a donation from IC alumnus Dr.
Gary Tanaka.
The second question and
answer session by the Rector
took place in the Great Hall,
where Sir Richard outlined his
plans to strengthen the
Imperial College brand.
It was revealed that the
College had applied for its own
degree-awarding powers
which, if granted, would see it
gain independence from the
University of London by 2007.
The Rector also confirmed
that Garden Hall will be sold -
apparently to provide funding
for the Southside refurbish-
ment project.
The Union decided that it
couldn't afford to run a
Summer Ball without signifi-
cant financial support from the
College. The College had
offered to under-write the
event, but the Union insisted
that the College already owed
them the £25,000 that was on
offer. The dispute was later
resolved by the Deputy Rector,
Professor Peter Bearman.
The Summer Ball was
revived a week later with a
£20,000 gift from the College to
plug the projected financial
shortfall. A desperate search
was undertaken by Union
President, Sen Ganesh, to find
students willing to take on the
task of planning the event.
Many months of wrangling
finally came to a head with a
five hour meeting of Union
Council to ratify proposed
changes to the way that the
Union represents students to
the College. The required
majority was easily reached,
with David Francis (Deputy
President for Education and
Welfare) the only person who
voted against the new
changes being made.
Rumours of a new sabbatical
position were reported by
Felix. The new position -
Deputy President for External
Sites - would cover all Wye,
Silwood and Medical campus-
es. There were suggestions
that this might remove the
need for a sabbatical Medic
President.
year review
A company headed by the for-
mer Tory cabinet minister John
Selwyn Gummer offered to
upgrade the College's air con-
ditioning system in an effort to
help combat its chronic energy
shortage problem.
Earthcare Products was
reported to have offered to pro-
vide an integrated cooling
service for £700,000 per year
more than the College current-
ly pays.
February
The Higher Education Funding
Council for England decided to
cut next year's funding to the
College despite the fact that
the results of this year's
research assessment exercise -
in which College achieved a
score of 6.68 - were higher than
last year.
The cut was made because
Imperial improved less than
other institutions nationally,
and so was entitled to a small-
er share of the same level of
available funds.
The Union was expected to
feel a knock-on effect, particu-
larly as its finances were
already under pressure, while
it was contractually obliged to
increase the salaries of the sab-
batical officers by 8% as a
result of an increase in the
standard PhD grant from the
Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council.
The combined effect was
expected to result in cuts in
funding to clubs and societies,
although the Union intended to
make up a large proportion of
the shortfall by improving the
efficiency of its central admin-
istration, including the scrap-
ping of the Activities Card for
sports clubs.
A new writing challenge was
launched by the College with
the aim of promoting good
writing by its students.
'Writing the Future' was
designed to enable undergrad-
uates and postgraduates alike
