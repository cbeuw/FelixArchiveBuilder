year review

lied to finish with 185 points to
Somerville's 200.
The performance of the
Imperial team - comprising
captain Darius Fidgett of com-
puting, Sunil Rao studying
information systems, Patrick
Hayes of chemistry and Lloyd
Kilford studying number theo-
ry - was praised by quizmaster
Jeremy Paxman.
"To get to the final is a terrif-
ic achievement... they were
storming back at the end and
they almost did it."
Rob Davenport, this year's
Deputy President for Clubs and
Societies, was elected to the
position of ULU's Vice
President for Sports with a
mandate of 250 votes from an
electorate of over 120,000 stu-
dents. Well done Rob!
The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,
announced that he was to
stand down as Non-Executive
Chairman of the pharmaceuti-
cal giant GlaxoSmithKline, to
concentrate on his efforts on
boosting the profile of the
College and the implementa-
tion of the new faculty struc-
ture due to come into effect in
August. Sir Richard had
retained his position on the
board of GSK when he was
appointed Rector of Imperial
College in January 2001.
The Union's new constitution
was approved by an efficient
meeting of Union Council, led
Rector: stood down at GSK
by new chair Andy Heeps, fol-
lowing the resignation of Sam
Sharpe. The change was need-
ed to reflect the changes in the
structure of the College; name-
ly the abolition of the con-
stituent colleges and their
replacement with faculties.
Medical students said an emo-
tional goodbye to Gladys', the
much-loved bar at the St.
Mary's in Paddington. It was
closed after seventy years of
use to make way for the con-
struction of a new 'animal
house.' So, no change there.
A record number of students
turned out to vote in the refer-
endum on Imperial College
Union's affilliation to the
National Union of Students
(NUS). It was the first NUS vote
at Imperial in almost six years.
Although the NUS had
expected that they would be
able to recruit Imperial as a
member, their hopes were
dashed as 28% of the student
body turned out to cast their
vote - the largest turnout in liv-
ing memory for a College elec-
tion. The 'no' campaign won by
1983 votes to 766.
Campaigning on both sides
was fierce as the poll
approached. The 'no' cam-
paign had the backing of sever-
al former Union Presidents,
while the 'yes' campaign
imported representatives of
the NUS to canvass students
on the streets around the South
Kensington campus.
The spring session of the web-
based Lecturer Evaluation
Questionnaire was expected to
work far better than the
autumn one had, after some
"cosmetic changes" had been
made to the system, and it had
been "road-tested by a few
student volunteers."
Similar problems were
encountered however, and the
web-based L E Q was aban-
doned once again.
Botulism: busted
April
A security guard in the
Blackett Laboratory - home to
the Physics Department - was
attacked by an intruder bran-
dishing a knife during the
Easter vacation in the first
serious attack on a member of
College security in more than a
decade.
The man was challenged by
security guard Tom Gamble as
he attempted to enter the
building, asking to see a par-
ticular senior member of staff
in the physics department. He
described himself as a 'physi-
cist' and wished to tell the
staff member of a physical the-
ory he had devised.
He produced the large blade
on being challenged, and Mr
Gamble was only able to pre-
vent a potentially lethal blow
to the neck by blocking the
blade with his right hand,
which sustained serious injury
in the incident.
When other members of
College security arrived to
assist, the man was wrestled
to the ground and disarmed,
but was able to spray those
present with surgical spirit.
Once he had been subdued,
the assailant claimed that he
was in possession of an explo-
sive device.
The bomb squad later joined
the assembled representatives
of the emergency services. The
department, Prince Consort
Road and the surrounding area
were closed off for the rest of
the day.
Felix also reported that a num-
ber of thefts had been commit-
ted in Evelyn Gardens by an
individual described as being
very tall, having dreadlocks
and being of Afro-Caribbean
appearance.
May
That the vast majority of
Imperial's student population
had their heads in a book revis-
ing for forthcoming exams was
evident at the start of May,
when a lead story in Felix
reported that Union President
had injured his finger in "a
complex stapling operation in
the Union's South Kensington
offices." The finger has now
made a full recovery.
