review year
the Charing Cross campus in
Hammersmith was completed,
and its new bar was opened in
the area that had previously
been known as the 'airport
lounge.'
The new student facilities at
the site include a snack shop
and seating area, which
becomes a dancefloor by night.
There is also a gymnasium in
the basement.
In a rare act of generosity,
West London Magistrates
Court granted the bar a late
licence on the understanding
that Medics work hard, but
also 'play har-d' too.
Professor Oliver Dolly, a mem-
ber of staff in the biochemistry
department, was placed under
investigation over alleged
breaches of Government regu-
lations regarding research on
dangerous substances.
It had been claimed that
Professor Dolly failed to notify
the Health and Safety
Executive before beginning
work on a potentially lethal
class 2 strain of genetically-
modified botulism.
Felix reported that a junior
researcher who raised the
question of HSE authorisation
was immediately fired by
Professor Dolly. College
authorities were notified and
he was escorted from his office
by security officers.
A man was arrested under
suspicion of theft in the vicini-
ty of Beit Hall when he was
apprehended with several
items of stolen electronics in
his possession.
The man - who was on bail
at the time of his arrest - was
known to both security and the
police, and had previously
assaulted some of the
College's security officers.
Felix revealed that College
authorities had approved
plans to sell Clayponds hall of
residence in the summer of
2003 for an estimated £8m,
raising doubts about the
College's ability to meet its
guarantee of providing accom-
modation to all first-year
undergraduates.
The sale of Clayponds - situ-
ated in Ealing and housing 332
students, mostly first year
overseas postgraduates
would coincide with planned
refurbishments to both
Southside and Bernard Sunley
halls, meaning that College
would have to find an extra
330 bedspaces just to keep its
guarantee to freshers.
A n angry meeting of the
Union Executive Committee
established that students had
not been consulted regarding
the proposed sell-off. Senior
College officials tried to por-
tray the decision as "cock-up,
not conspiracy," and agreed
that the student body should
have been informed of the
plans in advance.
Concerns over student accom-
modation deepened when the
sale of Clayponds was con-
firmed. It was also revealed
that the College had insuffi-
cient cash to fund the planned
refurbishment of the Southside
halls, yet was still intent on
building a new £12.7m head-
quarters building on the South
Kensington campus.
A n interim balance sheet
approved by College Council
showed that £30m was
expected to be raised through
the sale of student residences,
yet only £8m was to be
ploughed into residences
refurbishment with the rest
being diverted into the new
H Q project and sports hall
redevelopment. The possibility
of privatising Southside halls
was raised as a possible solu-
tion to the funding crisis.
Meanwhile, proposals to
allow students to stay in
Linstead, Southside and
Weeks halls over the Easter
vacation were approved in
response to complaints from
students and their parents
inconvenienced by having to
move out at the end of the
spring term and then move
back shortly before the onset
of the summer exams.
In an interview with the
Financial Times, the Rector, Sir
Richard Sykes, was alleged to
have called for the creation of a
group of elite universities
rivalling the American 'Ivy
League' to place Britain at the
forefront of science education.
Sir Richard - a member of the
Government's Council for
Science and Technology and
the new Science Policy
Strategy Board of the
Department of Trade and
Industry - called for the estab-
lishment of around twelve uni-
versities that would be able to
charge students tuition fees at
market rates. These could
exceed £10,000 each year,
potentially enabling scientific
institutions to attract the best
students and research staff by
offering the "best conditions in
the world."
His words were seen as a
warning to Tony Blair, who
recently told the Royal Society
that he wanted to make the UK
"one of the best places in the
world to do science."
Summer Ball revellers
Clayponds: going in 2003?
June
Firefighters were called to the
Charing Cross campus over
the Golden Jubilee Bank
Holiday when an electrical
fault caused a generator to
spill diesel oil within the hos-
pital. Early reports claimed
that around ten thousand litres
of oil had escaped, but the
spillage in fact turned out to be
only a minor one with no
injuries and no detrimental
effect either on patients in the
hospital or their care.
Despite having been cancelled
and then reinstated earlier in
the year, the Summer Ball went
off well with live performances
from Cornershop, the James
Taylor Quartet and Mos Eisley,
along with sets from the ICU
Big Band, and Jazz and Rock
societies.
While the event itself was
successful, low ticket sales
mean that the event is unlikely
to break even. However, a
meeting of the Union Council
was given assurances that the
event will take place next year,
probably with funding from
College in a similar vein to this
year's £20,000 gift.
The Deputy President for
Education & Welfare, David
Francis, was given a written
warning by the Union
President after an LEQ-related
complaint was upheld.
