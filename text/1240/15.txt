That Was The Year
Beit Hall: £17 million of three star student luxury
September
The start of the new College
year saw the re-opening of Beit
Hall and its East and West
basements, after the College
and Union refurbishment proj-
ects were finally completed
during the summer vacation.
The Beit Hall project -
intended to provide students
with 'three-star accommoda-
tion' - was due to be complet-
ed a year earlier but was over-
run by financial problems. The
original contractors hit finan-
cial difficulties in June 2000
and went bankrupt later that
year. This helped to increase
the cost of the project from
£12.5m to almost £17m.
The hall was officially
reopened on 28 September
by Lady Beit, who unveiled
a plaque on the East wall
of the archway entrance to
the Quad. Otto Beit, a
direct ancestor of hers,
gave College the money for
the construction of the
There was a mixed reaction
when Imperial College Union
unveiled its n e w corporate
identity and logo. Felix report-
ed that the incoming sabbati-
cal officers had approved the
rebranding without consulting
the Union Executive.
The brand-new sabbatical
team were keen to implement
the updated branding in time
for the arrival of freshers at the
end of September, but after a
breakdown in communication
between the incoming and
outgoing sabbaticals, the new
look was chosen and approved
by the sabbaticals alone.
While few people objected
to the branding itself - estimat-

ed to cost £17,000, with a
£5,000 contribution from the
Imperial College Trust - many
spoke out at what they saw as
a breach of democracy.
Speaking at the time, former
Union President Andy Heeps
told Felix that ICU had fallen
"into the pits of democracy
that so befall other student
unions."
October
Students returning to
Imperial's Wye campus in Kent
found that their own Union
building h a d undergone a
£20,000 refurbishment over the
summer months.
The Rector made sweeping
changes in the top manage-
ment of the College's Estates
Department, but senior
College officials refused to
comment on the motive
behind the changes. Estates
was split into three separate
departments; Property,
Maintennance and Projects.
The Director of Estates, Ian
Caldwell, was unceremonious-
ly removed from day-to-day
control of his department and
put in charge of the College's
long term property develop-
ment strategy.
The Centre for Computing
Services and parts of Estates
were merged into the new
department of Information and
Communication Technology.
Imperial's R A G Sports Day
took place on a sunny Friday
afternoon a n d raised over
£1,800 for the homeless
charity Shelter. The Sports
Day Ball followed later that
evening, with donations
adding to the £900 that R A G
raised during Freshers Week
events.
Felix reported that the num-
ber of available parking
spaces on the South
Kensington campus was due
to plummet from 330 to just
150 for the next two years as
the Dalby Court car park dis-
appeared under the n e w
College HQ building.
This was later increased to
220, as the move was deeply
unpopular with College's staff
motorists, a n d would also
mean that the College would
lose out on the income it gen-
erates from leasing spaces to
punters at the Royal Albert
Hall,
The number of freshers intend-
ing to apply to the College for
the October 2002 intake was
placed under scrutiny after
Felix reported that potential
students were considering
delaying their application to
take advantage of the possible
reintroduction of student
grants for students starting
university in October 2003.
The Union's Beit Basements
were reopened by the broad-
caster and journalist Trevor
Philips - a former Union
President - and the Bishop of
London, the Rt. Rev and Rt.
Hon. Richard Chartres, i n a

Freshers Dinner ended with a
small group of drunken stu-
dents embroiled in a food fight
and vomiting i n the Senior
Common Room.
College offi-
cials were
unhappy with
the situation and
q u e s t i o n e d
whether the
Royal School of
Mines Union
should be
allowed to hold
social events on
College premises
in future.
The Media Centre - housed
in the West Basement - was
still not completely finished at
the time of the official opening,
despite the valiant efforts of
the project manager, Iain
Campbell. Speaking to Felix,
he said that the Union had "lit-
tle experience with running
projects of this scale and com-
plexity, and consequently the
learning curve has been
exceedingly steep."
Despite the fact that the ICU
Media Group societies were
also still awaiting the arrival of
some of their brand-new
equipment, the basements
project w a s generally
acknowledged as a success.

Southside Hall was replaced
by an enlarged Southside
shop, with a new fast food
servery, a wider range of
yummy foodstuffs and extend-
ed opening hours.
College decided to close
Basics mainly because of the
large losses - sometimes in
excess of £100,000 - that the
outlet had been producing in
the past couple of years. Take-
aways were apparently more
popular than restaurant meals.
Down in leafy Kent, the Wye
College Union Society (WCUS)
announced that it was consid-
ering plans to move to new
premises to comply with the
Disability Discrimination Act,
which comes into effect i n
2004.
The Olave building - its cur-
rent site - would require large
scale renovation to comply
with the legislation and ensure
adequate provision for the dis-
abled, and it was thought that
relocating to the nearby ADAS
building might prove a more
cost-effective solution.
A visit to the Rector's house at
170 Queens Gate b y the
Chinese Vice President, H u
Jintao, caused commotion on
the South Kensington campus.
A group of protesters turned
out to draw attention to the
cause of those persecuted i n
China for membership of the
spiritual and meditative Falun
Gong movement, branded b y
the Chinese authorities as an
'evil cult'. Police officers kept
order at the Falmouth Gate
entrance to College, where a
group of Chinese students
studying in London had also
assembled to greet Mr Hu.
November
A charged session of Union
Council revealed that Union
President, Sen Ganesh, intend-
ed to call a referendum on affil-
iation to the NUS.
Lome M c E w a n , former
President of the Medics' Union
(ICSMU) suggested the radical
proposal of creating four new
sabbatical positions; one for
each of the four College facul-
ties due to come into existence
on 1 August 2002.
To meet the costs of the new
positions, Mr. M c E w a n pro-
posed the abolition of the
Deputy Presidents for
Education and Welfare, Clubs
and Societies and also the Felix
Editor as sabbatical positions.
Senior College officials told
Felix that the on-off Southside
refurbishment would now defi-
nitely take place in late 2003.
After five years of planning the
College was forced to move
the project to the top of its pri-
ority list because of concerns
that heating, water and venti-
lation services might fail.
There was no word on how
College planned to fund the
£20 million project, though
Felix was happy to speculate.
The Royal School of Mines
building was evacuated after
smoke was discovered in the

the incident was later discov-
ered to be contractors refur-
bishing the basement.
A n emergency meeting of
Union Council was called to
discuss restructuring the
Union in light of the College's
new faculty structure. The
Council Chair, Sam Sharpe,
was replaced by former Union
President, Andy Heeps.
After Mr. Heeps promised to
remove one item of clothing
per opinion expressed (the
Chair is prohibited from
expressing bias) there was a
productive two hour discus-
sion and a very full flip-chart.
A working group w a s con-
vened to discuss the tedious
