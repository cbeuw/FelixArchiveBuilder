to communicate an element of
their degree course to a wider
audience. It replaces the
Rector's 'Communication
Competition'.
IndianSoc caused a storm at a
packed meeting of Union
Council following President,
Sen Ganesh's handling of fire
regulations at the East Meets
West event in the Great Hall.
They were eventually told to
put their concerns in writing
and bring them to the Union
Executive committee for con-
sideration and adjudication.
Authorities at Wye commenced
negotiations with the NHS in a
move that could provide nurses
with accommodation at the
Kent campus and allow them
full access to its bars and
sports facilities. Wye is already
home to 55 cadets of the Police
Training Academy in Ashford.
Felix also reported that the
College was in the process of
disposing of Coldharbour
House, another of its Wye resi-
dences, to raise funds.
The eight-day extravaganza
known as RAG Week 2002
raised more than Â£9,000 for the
Shooting Star Childrens'
Hospice Appeal. Fundraising
events included an
International Pub Crawl, the
City & Guilds Slave Auction
and abseiling down the
Chelsea Design Centre.
Students also took to the
streets of the capital in the
London Raid, while the week
culminated in 'School Uniform
Day' in which students paid a
small donation to the appeal
for the opportunity to spend
the day at College in the appar-
el of their alma mater.
Campaigning for the sabbati-
cal elections got underway at
the end of February following
an extended nomination peri-
od, after it was decided that
the nomination papers had not
been sufficiently well-adver-
tised in the first week.
Hustings brought with them
fresh controversy, particularly
the session at Wye, which
began before all of the candi-
dates had arrived at the Kent
campus, having been caught in
rush-hour traffic from the capi-
tal.
During the South Kensington
session, an Emergency meet-
ing of the Union Executive
Committee took place near the
bar and over-ruled the
Returning Officer's decision to
allow only written questions.
Those victorious in the polls
were the current President, Sen
Ganesh, and current Felix
Editor, Will Dugdale, who both
benefited from a new Union
rule that allows students to
spend a second year as a sab-
batical officer.
The other winners were
Nona Ahamat (Deputy
President for Clubs and
Societies), Ram Ramanan
(Deputy President for Finance
and Services) and Andrew
Smith (Deputy President for
Education and Welfare).
ABV, the RCSU wine tasting
society, had thirty-two bottles
of wine stolen from the Union
in the latest of a series of thefts
and attempted thefts from the
Union building. The Union con-
ceded joint responsibility for
the theft but agreed to fully
reimburse the club for the loss.
March
The results of the sabbatical
elections were shrouded in
uncertainty after Medic
President, Shazia Munir, made
a formal complaint to the
Returning Officer, David
Francis, regarding the place-
ment and limited number of
ballot boxes on the medical
campuses and criticised the
"lack of notice" given to stu-
dents wishing to register their
vote remotely.
Some suggested that Ms.
Munir's enthusiasm for re-run-
ning the elections were con-
nected with the narrow defeat
of fourth-year medic, Idris
Harding, in the vote for Union
President, who overwhelming-
ly beat all other candidates for
the position in the counts at
the medical campuses.
Ms. Munir's objections to the
running of the sabbatical elec-
tions were not upheld and the
Medic President decided not to
appeal at the next meeting of
Union Council, so the results of
the elections were finally
declared as valid.
Imperial played host to the
second London Alternative
Careers fair in March, organ-
ised jointly between E-Soc and
the LSE Environmental
Initiatives Network.
The fair aimed to show stu-
dents that there are more
options for Imperial graduates
other than the usual crop of
positions in 'consultancy and
financial services' that are
advertised prominently in the
annual Union Careers Fair.
Imperial took on Somerville

Wye: nurses' home
College, Oxford in the final of
University Challenge. While
the series was recorded in the
autumn, the teams were
sworn to secrecy over the
result until it was televised in
March. The Imperial team,
who were looking for a record-
breaking third w i n of the com-
petition after claiming the title
in both 1996 and 2001, got off
to a catastrophic start but ral-
