SPORE
OK, first things
first: Will Wright is God.
But not only that, he gives
you the power too. Crea-
tor of the most popular PC
game ever, The Sims, as
well as the frankly magi-
cal SimCity, he developed
worlds entirely under your
control. Now he wants to
take you one step further:
his new creation, Spore,
will grant you the potential
to control the very evolu-
tion of a species. From
the beginnings of life itself
to the spawn of a galac-
tic civilisation, Spore will
guide you through the
ages, where according to
the man himself, almost
anything can happen.
That is, if it ever gets
released.
Currently eight years in
the making, Spore was
first announced at the
2005 Electronic Entertain-
ment Expo. Electronic
Arts, who bought Wright’s
soul in the form of Maxis
Software over ten years
ago, have announced a
tentative release date
of spring 2008. This
definitely remains
to be seen, how-
ever, as while
Wright has
stated that the
game is cur-
rently fully-
playable, no
real dem-
onstrations
have come
forth and
the compa-
ny remains
tight-lipped
about the
actual depth
of the game.
The Spore de-
velopment team aim to create
what could potentially be the
most open-ended video game
in history – a monumental task
by anyone’s standards. As a re-
sult, many are sceptical of the
game, leading some to claim it
as “vapourware,” despite the
game being seemingly on track
for the release date, and others
to doubt its level of creativity,
even before it goes gold. This
is balanced, however, by the
growing number of fan com-
munities centred on its eventual
release, geared towards discus-
sion of the game and a means
to effectively share the content
that the users create.
The game’s premise is simple
to explain, but tough to create
in practice: a comet crashes on
a planet of the player’s choos-
ing, causing the complex reac-
tions which culminate in living
organisms. As these organisms
thrive, they evolve into more in-
teresting creatures, which then
formsocieties,whichmergeinto
civilisations, which
then, as
with
human beings, seek to ex-
plore the universe to perhaps
find some life apart from their
own. During all this, the player
can manipulate not only the
structure of the overall system
but the creatures themselves,
controlling both their physical
makeup and to a lesser extent,
their thoughts and actions. In
this, it is quite representative of
Maxis’ earlier games. However,
as Spore spans such a great
transition, from single microbes
to advanced city-states, the level
of control must change accord-
ingly. As you progress through
the five stages, the control over
individuals is relinquished in fa-
vour of more direct control over
the entire population.
The Spore development team
are very keen to promote their
content-sharing service, which
automatically uploads your
planets to a central database.
This information is then shared
with other players, who can
download the planets and ex-
plore them in their own game.
The game features a
reporting system
which should in-
form a player
of how
their
crea-
tures are faring in other uni-
verses, including the number
of times another player has de-
stroyed their own planet. While
it seems like a fairly gimmicky
idea, it opens doors to vast pos-
sibilities – for example, you could
groom your creatures towards
creating alliances and therefore
protecting them as they venture
out into the multiverse.
Perhaps the most interesting
component of Spore from a sci-
entific perspective is what we call
procedurally-generated content.
Simply put, it is a method of cre-
ating the objects in game using
algorithms, in order to both min-
imise the storage needed for the
humongous number of possible
creations and to maximise the
potential diversity throughout
the game. While in most games,
each character, building and tree
is created by an artist, allowing
the computer to randomly gen-
erate the objects in the game
on the fly lets us open up whole
worlds of never-before-seen
content. When combined with
a large variety of textures based
on the real world to add real-
ism to the picture, this can allow
for massive replayability and
will give players a warm fuzzy
feeling inside, as you can guar-
antee their care-
fully-groomed
creatures are
unique through-
out the planet.
Not all is ran-
dom, however:
once we’ve cre-
ated the random
creature, along
with its surround-
ings, more strict
algorithms are
used in order to
help the creatures
evolve and adapt
to their environ-
ment. Rather
than sporadically
growing new
limbs, these ef-
fects are more
subtle: losing
an unnecessary
tail, or sprouting
claws to ward off
enemies. A com-
bination of these
two methodolo-
gies should mean
that you never
play the same
game twice.
A bit of vari-
ety between each
play is perhaps
necessary: with
today’s games
concentrating
perhapstoomuch
on an epic sto-
ryline, Spore slides
neatly into the gap
left, where players are
given a virtual sandbox
to run the world as they
see fit. These so-called
“god” games have al-
ways had a place in the
gamer’s heart, where
they can let loose and
create (or destroy) to
their heart’s desire. Per-
haps the power is what
attracts them, perhaps
the freedom, or maybe
just a need to discover
the possibilities lent
to them by a game so
fast, but I have a feel-
ing that if it is released
come spring, Spore will
spawn a new craze in
an industry just realis-
ing its potential.
Well, until Duke
Nukem Forev-
er comes out,
obviously.
STARCRAFT II
May 19, 2007 may be a
long forgotten day in the
memories of the majority,
but for the 10,000 Koreans
who attended Blizzard’s
Worldwide Invitational it
remains a sacred moment
as Blizzard unveiled its lat-
est product. Yes, finally
Starcraft II has made it to
the screens and the world
was in awe. Shortly after-
wards, the internet was
consumed with ecstasy.
At first look, the game is
similar to its predecessor
but revamped with allur-
ing graphics: a significant
improvement over the
now simplistic visuals
of the original. The
game boosts new
features coupled
with a array of
units
both old
and new. Starcraft
gamers will recognise the famil-
iar Protoss zealot, which has the
ability to charge and engage in
melee combat or the zergling
swarm, now capable of mutat-
ing into suicidal bombs. They
will not recognise new units
such as the Protoss Immortal,
a powerful cybernetic warrior
that can nullify powerful attacks
with its shield nor initially com-
prehend the power of a Protoss
Mothership till they have wit-
nessed the ‘Black Hole’ wipe out
entire armies. Now, ambushes
can be made onto unsuspect-
ing units by those that are posi-
tioned on higher tiers of terrain
whilst remaining invisible by
the fog of war.
Online gamers are promised
with an im-
proved ladder
system similar
to the one currently
in operation for Warcraft
III, fostering true competition.
Rising to the top levels would
be challenging no doubt, hav-
ing seen the uber micro skills
of aficionados. Players eager
play single-player can watch
the Starcraft saga unfold as the
epic tale continues.
With the enormous size of
the Blizzard fanbase in world-
wide (especially in Korea where
Starcraft is considered a sport)
and the vast interest generated,
the game has been hyped up
to be a big success. However,
Blizzard’s major challenge is to
bring Starcraft II into an already
saturated market whilst satisfy-
ing hardcore gamers maintain-
ing the level of quality that the
original had delivered. A chal-
lenge that is yet to be tested...
