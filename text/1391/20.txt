Funding Secured for
refurbishing the Union!
Last term finished with some very
good news for our Union. Last term
tI submitted a revised bid for funds to
the College so that we could proceed
with the second stage of the Beit
Redevelopment project and this bid
was approved to the tune of £1.93m.
The focal point of this project will be
the installation of a mezzanine in what
is currently the Union gym which will
be the home of a brand new Student
Activities Centre. The statistics show you
to be the most active student body in the
country when it comes to participating
in Clubs and Societies, which is why
we are delighted that we now have the
funds in place to give your facilities a
much needed upgrade.
The work is initially scheduled to be
completed by January 2009 so this will
be of benefit to all non-finalists, whilst
continuing to show Imperial College
Union’s commitment to its UK leading
student activities programme.
Student Juries
Student Juries are part of a new
government initiative to listen to students
and make sure that their voice is heard at
the heart of government. It is a chance
for ordinary students to feed in their
personal experiences of University life
to policy makers. If you are interested in
applying send me an email and I will pass
on a copy of the application form; or look
out for further details in the next Union
email. It will only involve one afternoon
of your time and if selected you have the
opportunity of winning £75 in addition
to the benefit of having Imperial College
London represented at this event.
RAG
RAG is the Union’s charitable outlet
and next week they are hosting two
introductory events for those of you who
are interested in doing some fund raising.
The first one, RAG Jump will be held at
12.30pm in Huxley 340 on Monday 14th
January where you can find out about
raising money for an ICT project in Kenya
by going skydiving!
If jumping out of
planes isn’t really
your thing but you
would still like
to get involved
then you might
be interested in
the Take Action
cycling events
which aim to raise
money for medical care and research
facilities for sick and vulnerable babies.
This talk will be given at 12.30pm next
Friday, again in Huxley 340.

Welcome Back!
Fairtrade Fortnight
25 February - 9 March
To celebrate our recent achievement
of Fairtrade University Status we will
be organising a fortnight of events to
promote ethical consumerism. You
will have the chance to try something
new from our wide range of Fairtrade
Products available on Imperial’s Campus
from Coffee and Chocolate to T-shirts
and Hoodies. Prepare to be amazed
at the endless possibilities as we road
test exciting products such as footballs,
bananas or steaming mugs of hot
chocolate.
Turning toward the bigger picture
Imperial College Union has teemed
up with fellow Fairtrade Unions, Kings
College London Students’ Union and
London School of Economics Students’
Union, to lobby Westminster Council to
support Fairtrade in our local Borough.
As part of the London Fairtrade City
Campaign, only three more Boroughs
are required to meet the criteria of
the Fairtrade Foundation to become a
Fairtrade City!
Find out how you can help during
Fairtrade Fortnight or by contacting
Kirsty Patterson, Deputy President
(Education and Welfare).
Go Green Week
19 - 22 February
Green Week has just got bigger and
better than ever! As part of a national
campaign by People and Planet, Unions
across the country will be taking action
to encourage recycling, energy saving
and sustainability on campus and in the
wider community.
At Imperial we will be launching a new
recycling strategy throughout the South
Kensington Campus. This will make it
easier to guarantee that our efforts to
recycle paper, card, plastic, glass and
metal are not going to waste.
The Green Fayre on Tuesday 19th will
be our biggest event with a plethora of
environmentally friendly products on
sale. Imperial College Union will also
be looking for support in improving
our ‘Green League’ Ranking which is
published by People and Planet in the
Times Higher Education Supplement.
We are currently ranked 60th out of 100
institutions that took part in the League
Table.
To find out more about making our
Campus Greener contact Hannah
Theodorou or Laurence Fahrni, Green
Week Co-ordinators.
