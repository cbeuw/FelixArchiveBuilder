Drink (water) to your health!

Water is crucial for us to remain
healthy and alive, but all too often it is
taken for granted as to why it is so im-
portant and to what extent it helps us
perform better in exercise. Water is the
second most important element to life
next to oxygen. The body can survive
for weeks without food but only days
with out water, and often for a lot less
in warm temperatures and high alti-
tudes. The body and all its organs are
comprised mainly of water making the
average person about 60-75% water.
Water is essential to all bodily func-
tions. It aids our digestive system with
the absorption of nutrients, it’s in-
volved in the regulation of body tem-
perature and blood circulation, it helps
in the transport of nutrients and oxy-
gen to cells and removes waste prod-
ucts from the body. Alongside these
functions water also helps to reduce
wear on joints providing lubrication
and cushioning, including the spinal
cord. Without sufficient water supply
(dehydration) we open up our bodies
to all kinds of problems. Dehydration
can lead to hypertension, asthma, al-
lergies and migraines.
The main function of water is its
role in regulating our temperature. We
generate heat when we train and there
are numerous mechanisms which the
body calls upon to lose heat. Obviously
the surrounding environment plays a
role, but a significant method of cool-
ing is sweating. The evaporation of flu-
id from the skin is very effective. Dur-
ing prolonged exercise it is possible to
lose as much as two litres of sweat per
hour. This would be ideal in keeping us
cool, but unfortunately not all sweat
evaporates, as some drops off the skin
and is wasted.
Fluid loss, even as little as 2% of body
weight, can seriously impair the ca-
pacity to perform muscular work. In
temperate climates, most athletes lose
1-5% of body weight in prolonged ex-
ercise, even when taking regular fluid
throughout.
Water transports oxygen, nutrients,
hormones and antibodies through the
blood stream and lymphatic system
(used to fight cancer, viruses, bacte-
ria and infections). This is obviously
important to us as we push our bod-
ies hard in the gym and by doing so
we greatly increase the amount of wa-
ter that our body excretes. When we
are dehydrated our immune system is
therefore open to invasion from out-
side entities and we are more suscep-
tible to the attack. Therefore good hy-
dration helps to protect us from this.
Brain tissue is 85% water and it uses
a twentieth of the body’s blood supply.
When you are dehydrated you have
less water in the blood and this lack of
water can reduce brain functions and
can cause fatigue, depression, stress
and can also lead to migraines which
may be also be an indicator or poor
body temperature regulation.
Muscle is 75% water, so it is impor-
tant that a high water level is main-
tained in order to prevent muscular
dehydration. When muscles become
dehydrated they are open to possible
loss of strength and cramps. Cramps
are a muscle spasm where a muscle
contracts abnormally and locks into an
awkward position. Although the direct
cause of cramp remains unknown, it
is known that muscles that are over-
worked, injured or exposed to extreme
temperatures are more likely to suc-
cumb to cramp. Water helps to regu-
late our body temperature and aids in
the transport of nutrients to cells, so by
increasing water intake we can reduce
the risk of cramp.
Water is a lubricant for the joints and
the cartilage between the vertebrae
and at the end of long bones at syno-
vial joints there is also a significant
amount of water. Cartilage needs to
be well hydrated as this prevents abra-
sive damage occurring when the op-
posing surfaces of the cartilage make
contact with each other. Long term
inadequately hydrated joints can lead
to friction damage resulting in joint
deterioration and pain.
Another reason why water is also
important is due to the fact that when
we dehydrate, our body’s solution loses
viscosity, which in turn reduces the
efficiency of the protein and enzyme
functions of the body. So when we are
trying to increase our protein absorp-
tion, water is a fundamental aspect
as acids and enzymes in the stomach
break food down into a more fluid
state as part of the digestion process.
Lack of fluid means you will not be
able to break down the food easily and
efficiently.
Water is also essential to us as it is
fundamental with regards to strength.
Being slightly dehydrated will reduce a
muscle’s lifting capability, and training
when in this state will reduce strength
gains that you might normally get.
If you can’t lift as much as when you
are adequately hydrated, then how can
you expect to push harder and make
gains?
Water can also be one of your most
useful tools for weight loss. Water is
calorie free so when you are on a re-
stricted diet, drinking water can help
fill you up and alleviate some of the
hunger.
