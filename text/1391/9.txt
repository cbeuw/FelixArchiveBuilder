Much-needed tips on how to swear
David Steward
T
ake a given person, X. It
is likely that if this given
person swears, they will
qualify their shit in the
wrong way. Let me dem-
onstrate this with a conversation taken
from real life:
X: Russell Brand is a pile of shit.
Y: You have every right so to opine. His
on-screen antics are unsavoury and
bewildering.
X: No. You don’t understand. He’s a
huge pile of shit.
Y: I have internalised what you said
and am reflecting on its import.
X: Listen to me. I’m not just mouthing
off here. You must understand that he’s
a mountain of shit so big that he ob-
scures the sun.
Y: I find the train of this conversation
repetitive and fruitless.
Person X in this situation is trying to
amplify the vehemence of his convic-
tion but Person Y quite rightly recog-
nises that Russell Brand, however shit,
is of fixed dimensions and so ludicrous
assertions regarding his size do not
have any reflection on his artistic mer-
it. A teaspoonful of shit, reasons Per-
son Y, is just as unappealing as a pile.
Instead, Person X might have tried
something more like: ‘Russell Brand is
a fucking pile of fucking shit.’ Exactly
what this is supposed to mean is still
unclear, however. One can envisage a
substance called ‘fucking shit’ which is
shit whose main raison d’être is to fuck
(or be fucked); then one could custom-
buildapileofittouseforfuckingthings
(or to be fucked by things). Clearly, this
would be worse than an ordinary pile
of shit, but exactly how much worse is
left to the sensibilities of the other par-
ty, who may, for instance, find ‘pissing
shit’ much more unsettling. Matters
become more unsatisfactory when one
notices the distinct lack of opportuni-
ties to insert the word ‘fucking’ into
the sentence ‘Russell Brand is a pile of
shit.’; one has thus a very limited abil-
ity to adjust ones vehemence according
to how deeply one feels the sentiment.
One can’t, for instance, say ‘Russell
Brand is a fucking pile of fucking, fuck-
ing shit.’ since the last ‘fucking’ is tau-
tologous – we have already established
the nature of the shit with which we are
dealing. One might attempt something
like ‘Russell Brand is a bum-titting
freak pile of fucking cock-arse rabbit
shit.’ and so forth, but one needs to
treat accuracy of expression as one’s
guiding principle. The following is far
more satisfying:
X: Russell Brand is a pile of shit.
Y: You have every right so to opine. His
on-screen antics are unsavoury and
bewildering.
X: I don’t think you understand the
vigour of the belief I invest in my
statement.
Y: Then you must explain it to me in
depth.
X: Let us take an absolute scale which
runs from 0 to 100 whose units shall be
known as Pricks. Let us further agree
on something which is not at all shit to
register a reading of zero.
Y: I propose bread.
X: Certainly there cannot be anything
shit about the staff of life. And let us set
the falling of the Earth into the Sun at
one hundred.
Y: It is duly noted.
X: Then Russell Brand is 99 pricks.
Y: Ahh. I believe I comprehend. You
mean that Russell Brand is a cunt.
X: Precisely.
