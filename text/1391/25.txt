Let the party continue! A false crisis due to amnesia
Game on, 2008! Game on!
W
ell, hello everyone!
I suppose com-
ing back after two
weeks of luxurious
indulgence only to
be thrust into a horrid whirlpool of ex-
ams and deadlines can’t be the nicest
thing. It sucks, no?
Worry not stalwart readers for we
are here to ease your suffering. So pick
up this issue of Felix and indulge in our
Games section. Starting from a retrop-
erspective of 2007 in terms of gaming
to the Holiday releases to the upcom-
ing titles of 2008, Felix Games takes a
comprehensive look at the stuff you
love. And the best part is that it’s writ-
ten for you, by you!
I do remember mentioning a new
concept for Felix Games and suffice it
to say it’s still work-in-progress but we
hope you’ll like it when it actually sees
the light of day.
This is poised to be quite an interest-
ing year for games particularly since it
has to live upto the astonishing bril-
liance of 2007 - an epochal 365 days
that gave us more fun than we’d dare
hope for.
I’d also like to take this opportunity to
give a heads up to an all-new tech sec-
tion headed by my good friend James
Finnerty. Tech and games go hand-in-
hand so we hope to satiate your crav-
ings with atleast a few collaborations
this year. Interestingly, they look at the
innards of the magical, wondrous Wii-
Mote. It’s really quite clever how the
little thing works.
Anyway, allow me to explain how this
issue works. It’s been done in the form
of spreads for each console (the PS3,
Xbox 360 and PC - unfortunately, Wii
submissions were nil, but we’ll work on
that soon enough!). On the left-hand
side you’ll get to read reviews of the
games that wowed us during the cold
winter months and kept us engrossed
when we were supposed to be revising.
Similarly, the right-hand side showcas-
es previews of upcoming games that
we think sound brilliant and will try
our very best to report on and cover
once they get released.
It may be slightly confusing graphi-
cally, but it’s been done deliberately to
create themes that are endemic and
indicative of the relevant gaming con-
sole. We’d definitely love your com-
ments since a lot of hours were put into
this issue.
Speaking of comments, the Reader
Riposte section should be back in full
swing once we resume normal serv-
ice. So we definitely want to hear your
comments (in 50 words or less) on the
gamesthatwe’rereviewinginthisissue.
Similarly, I’d like to call out to those in-
terested in writing for Felix Games but
were somewhat hesitant about start-
ing. My advice: don’t be. Submit your
work and start getting involved at the
fantastic world of Felix! Go on, warm
up MS Word - you know you want to!
Please do send in your comments,
opinions, criticism and all other game-
related pieces to games.felix@imperial.

Azfarul Islam would like to welcome you all to another year of gala gaming
G
reetings all! 2007 had
beenquiteayearfor those
who call
gaming
not just
a hobby but a passion.
It was a melange of
both good, bad and
downright outrageous
news and events. Let’s
take the quickest of re-
caps before reviewing
the best of the 2007
Winter holiday season
and then looking to-
wards the games that
will carry us through
the year 2008.
The earlier quarter
was defined by the
release of Sony’s Play-
Station 3 - an obsidian
behemoth of a console
that was really too ex-
pensive for its worth.
Despite that, it was
a portentous event meaning that all
three new consoles had finally graced
British soil and the competition here
had truly begun.
Around May, the newly revamped
E3
was observed. Moving away from
the smoke-and-mirrors glitz of the E3s
past, it had become a subdued seminar
of sorts being held at posh hotels.
In other, more terrestrial news, uber
retailer Game announced that they
would be absorbing GameStation into
their bloated bulk. What this means
for gamers is that a retail monopoly is
on the verge of being created and this
can hurt us financially. Nasty.
Rockstar’s tango with controversy
continued with its utterly immoral
Manhunt 2 being subject
to the ultimate ban-ham-
mer. However, Rockstar
decided to fight it out,
culminating in a cat-
and-mouse game where
victory
was short-
lived as
the case
was finally
referred to
the High
Court
with a de-
cision still
pending.
Gam-
ing was
brought
up by pol-
iticians as
well with
David
Cameron citing videog-
ames as one of the rea-
sons for a degenerating
youth culture. Gordon
Brown mentioned in-
teractive media but in
a far more diplomatic light explaining
that regulations over adult material
needed to be refined.
It’s no surprise that gaming is fi-
nally emerging into the limelight as
a premier and mainstream form of
media. 2007 witnessed a cavalcade of
watershed releases ranging from the
surprisingly fantastic to the fervently
anticipated.
The year was marked by the release
of hyped megahits such as God of War
II, Halo 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Call of
Duty 4, Unreal Tournament III, Com-
mand and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars
and Guitar Hero 3. And this was pretty
much the tip of the veritable iceberg.
There was a broad spectrum of qual-
ity and
variety
all across
the con-
sole smor-
gasbord.
Names like
Portal, Bi-
oShock,
Supreme
Com-
mander,
Rock
Band,
Mass Effect
and Su-
per Paper
Mario have
now been
juxtaposed
with inge-
nuity and
innovation.
To be fair,
it’s almost nigh on impossible to na-
mecheck the sheer quantity of quality
last year but rest assured, it was a Very
Good Year for GamingTM
.
2008 promises to be a quieter year,
characterised by the presence of a
more genuine gaming fanbase over a
mainstream one. The emphasis now
falls on the PlayStation 3 to truly rise
up to the challenge of making good on
the promise of such powerful hardware
capabilities. Titles like Metal Gear
Solid 4, LittleBigPlanet, Final Fantasy
XIII, Gran Turismo 5 and Devil May
Cry 4 offer what the PlayStation does
best: a fantastic concoction of variety
and quality.
On top of all this, the release of the
gargantuan Grand Theft Auto IV
looms with expectation and unfettered
hype.
Despite what seems to have been the
release of all their key franchise titles,
the Xbox 360 and Wii also have much
life left in
them and
it’ll be in-
teresting
to watch
developers attempt to
innovate as opposed to
rehash.
That’s it really, in a
tiny nutshell. We at Fe-
lix hope to be be there with you as 2008
continues forth and we hope you enjoy
the journey as much as we expect to. A
belated Happy New Year to all!
