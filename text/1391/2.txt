Election fever’s in the air Fresh delivery of chocolate
logs turf to Queen’s Lawn
Tom Roberts
Editor-in-Chief
As the race for the (Union) Presidents’ offices begins, Felix gives
readers the odds on who they can expect to see in the running
Across the pond there may be some
fairly important election preparations
going on, but closer to campus stu-
dents will soon be out and campaign-
ing for positions of power that really
matter.
The Spring term is here bringing
blossom back to trees and this year’s
Sabbatical elections. Election fever is
rife in the Union at the moment, so Fe-
lix is here to give readers the odds on
who they can expect to be standing for
positions within the Union once next
month’s elections come round.
For clarification, the Union is run
by four student Sabbatical Officers:
the Union President and three Deputy
Presidents, along with a team of per-
menant staff members. During Febru-
ary campus-wide elections will be run
to select who will be their successors,
along with an election for the next
Felix editor which is also a Sabbatical
position.
Any IC student can run and the rest
of the student body will vote online. Fe-
lix will be covering the event in much
more detail over the coming weeks,
but for now here are the predictions
for who you can expect to see running
for nomination. Note: they are not pre-
dictions on who will win!

Re-turfing of Queen’s Lawn began on Wednesday. The £250k
marquee which had been up for over half a year was eventually
taken down one week after the College’s planning permission
expired on 16th December, leaving a vast muddy bog. Some
students have reported pain in their eyes, diagnosed by doctors as
Greentitis – a sudden acute pain of the sarcastic gland in the eye.
