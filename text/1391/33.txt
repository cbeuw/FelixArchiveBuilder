Virgo
So... New Year’s
then. Fucking
Brill.I.Ant. See what
I’ve done there?
Adapted the name
of a famous rap and
hip-hop auteur so that it fits in snuggly with
the original sentence. Woohoo! Fireworks!
Oh they’re finished. Home time. Night.
Happynewyear. Foroldlang’seyemydear. What
a load of fucking nonsense.
Scorpio
This week you
grow a draught
beer tap out of
your left elbow.
Unfortunately the
amber nectar freely
flowing from your arm is not your usual tipple.
At first it’s enjoyable serving your friends
regular, free drinks but soon the novelty wears
off and turns to abuse. Metaphor: too much
drink kills rabbits.
Libra
“Next stop! Hell’s
Watering Hole”. It
had been a long
journey for time.
The soul on the
River Styx was actu-
ally called Dave, not Frank, causing an almost
endless furore only ceased by Tim’s offer of a
fridge magnet and a box of cling film to pass
through unscathed.
Sagittarius
You arrive in Tur-
key. Your flight was
late and you’re un-
derstandably frus-
trated and angry. In
the airport terminal
waiting for your luggage, you spy an old lady
entering the ladies’ lavatory. For shits and
giggles you stand outside her cubicle simply
staring at the door. Upon opening it you stare
deep into her soul. She keels over. Satisfaction.
Capricorn
So... if you had to,
you know... Celine
Dion or Mariah
Carey? Jade Goody
or Jodie Marsh?
Dean Gaffney or
Barry from Eastenders? Ainsley Harriot or
Anthony Worrell-Thompson? Personally,
I’d take them all snowboarding. We’d drink
Chianti and life would be bliss.
Cancer
This week it all
becomes too much
for you. The straw
that breaks the
<proverbial> back.
One <prover-
bial> too far. Too much giving, not enough
<proverbial>. All good things must come to
a <proverbial>. There’s no point crying over
spilt <proverbial>.
Gemini
This week you get
addicted to Grid
Wars 2. Upon
falling into your
bed, head meeting
pillow, your eyelids
close and you succumb to dreams of luminous
blue, pink, green, orange, yellow and magenta
shapes against a black background. You’re life
will never be the same, ever again. Enjoy it
whist it lasts. Addict.
Leo
I had a dream last
night that I had to
remove a bottom
snuggler worm from
a sheep’s ass. I also
had to tweezer out
the eggs which look like tic-tacs. I then sold
them to a sweet company, but they wouldn’t
tell me what they wanted them for. I have a
hunch, and I’m not eating tic-tacs no more.
You have been warned.
Taurus
This week in your
exam, things be-
come rather tough
around question 4.
No, 4b, not c. You
decide to try out the
button under your desk that frail man with the
wispy beard sold you for 600 Yen. Your finger
twitches over its red, shiny surface. BANG!
Bad rabies infected confetti drops from the
ceiling instantly decimating 203 people.
Aries
This week Puzzles is
culled to one page as
a result of the Great
Writers Strike 2010.
Like the Olympics
and my aunt’s bowel
movements, this happens once every three
years. During the last great strike of Welling-
ton in 2001, it was feared that over 20 different
words were lost to Martian captors.
Pisces
On your way into
work this morning,
a series of police-
men on motorcycles
speed past you, fol-
lowed by a black car
being escorted by more men on bikes. Now,
unless Michael Jackson or Winona Ryder was
in that car, there better be a damn good reason
why both lanes of traffic were stopped! Don’t
make me mad. GRRRRR.

Wordoku is identical to sudoku;
we’ve just replaced the numbers
with letters. Once you’ve
completed the puzzle, there
is a hidden word or phrase to
find. Email in your answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of Wordoku 1,390
was nobody. Nevertheless,
the hidden phrase was
“CHRIsTMAS”.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
#Sing it# Matty
Hoban, we love you.
Please come back to
this page. Stop the
horoscopes from
sounding poo. With
your help they never age. Some say your’s are
timeless. I say they just rock. Others say they
are a mess. I just say to them: “Get a life, or
I’ll come round your flat and burn your home
down then piss in your basil plant. DIE”.

How to rate yourself:
Under 8 words: You’re so dense that light
bends around you. Stoopid.
8 - 13 words: Your brain waves fall a little
short of the beach, don’t they.
14 - 19 words: You’re not too bad, but re-
member there’s no vaccine against stupid-
ity. Practice!
20 plus words: Someone’s been playing
too much Scrabulous on Facebook. Do
some work!
Last week’s solution:
The seven letter words were:
PRESENT
Congratulations if you had presents over
Christmas. You’ve clearly been good boys
and girls!
Other words included: peen, peens, peer,
peers, pees, penes, pens. pent, pert, pest,
pester, peter, peters, pets, preen, preens,
preset, prest, repent, repents, reps, seep,
sept, spent, steep, spree, steep, step, strep.
How to play
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter.
Capitalised words, conjugated verbs
(past tense etc), adverbs ending in
“-ly”, comparatives and superlatives are
disallowed.
A word you are not allowed in this case
would be “Felix” as none of the letters can
be found in the polygon. I think you know
the rules by now.
