I've written about free-
dom of the press before in
this column when I voiced
misgivings about Exec's
handling of the " Sennet
Affair." Recent attacks on
FELIX, particularly over its
reporting of the disappoint-
ing first JURGO meeting,
brought this same issue to a
head at this term's first
meeting of the Publications
Board at which even " Thev
Tell Me .. ." was criticised.
The Pro-Rector's invitation
to Piers " New-Think"
Corbyn to discuss his
JURGO article, on the front
page of the last FELIX,
has merely added fuel to the
fire. Dermott Corr, Guild's
President, who has led the
attack on FELIX, denies he
is seeking revenge for the
poor publicity he has re-
ceived lately, but the com-
position of the Publications
Board, which controls
FELIX finances, obscures
T H E Y T E L L M E . . . .
the position. As long as the
Pub' Board is dominated by
Exec, and no ordinary
Union members sit on it,
then anything they say on
FELIX editorial policy will
be clouded by the suspicion
they are seeking personal
glory. This is why Piers
Corbyn's suggestions for a
reformed Pub' Board are
valuable as they would
move power over FELIX
from the Exec to the Union
member (by replacing the
Constituent College Presi-
dents with ordinary Union
members), and possible in-
terference from the Go-
vernors on the grounds of
" staff-student relations," by
putting a staff member on
the Board.
In all the Christmas furore over the Prices and In-
comes Board report of lecturers' salaries, the most important
suggestion (from a student's point of view) seems to have
been forgotten. A lot of publicity was given to one very
small section of the report, which considered using student
surveys to help award teaching bonuses. This was in fact
only part of a very good general idea of relating academics'
salaries and status to their teaching ability.
At present, research is the most important factor in
determining an academic's progress. The argument for
this system is that work on the frontiers of science is neces-
sary in order to teach satisfactorily at an advanced level.
As a result of this there appears to be very little incentive
for the staff to increase the amount of time and effort they
put into teaching. Of the academics that do work hard on
the teaching side, the majority do so out of a feeling of
duty without any hope of personal advantage. In fact those
members of staff who neglect their research in favour of
teaching duties can be at a direct disadvantage. This seems
to me to be unfair on them and unfair on us.
I only hope that careful and objective analysis of the
PIB report will lead to adequate rewards for those aca-
demics who do combine teaching with research. This is
the test of maintaining a real difference between a Uni-
versity and a research institute.
With newly installed parking meters ticking away in
Queens Gate this seems a reasonable time to ask what
future there is, if any, for the student with a car. At the
moment we have a grand total of 154 parking places on
the College Campus, and it seems unlikely that this number
will increase by very much in the near future. Now that
Queens Gate has succumbed, it will be almost impossible to
drive in and leave a car just outside IC and so stickers are
likely to become very prize possessions indeed.
With this in mind, we must devise a better method of
distributing these places than the one used at the moment.
The old application form asks one vague question. " Why
do you want a parking place." It is assumed that people
know what this really means—i.e. how long does it take
you to travel in by car as opposed to Public Transport?,
what are the relative costs?, do you bring in any regular
passengers?, etc., etc. If we get in answer to the present
question, " Because I have a car and travel into College
each day," this may be a perfectly valid reason for having
a parking place, but it doesn't help in choosing between
several hundred applications.
Another gaping anomaly in the present system is that
inyone not living in a hall of residence is classed as a com-
nuter, and has to fight for his parking place on the grounds
jf how difficult his journey is. So obviously anyone who
ives in Queens Gate just doesn't qualify for a space. It
seems to me that we should place local residents on the
>ame footing as people in hall, and adjust the ratio of
•esidents and commuter places accordingly.

To the general detriment
of ICU, Collinge's feud with
External Affairs Committee
seems to be growing—per-
haps this is why we have still
to see any action from Wel-
fare or External Affairs on
the grants cut (especially on
a London weighting for
P.G.s on which the A U T
(staff union) and ASTMS
(technicians union) have
have recently acted). Rob
Collinge, ICU Welfare Of-
ficer, seems to take a nega-
tive attitude to the "Univer-
sity of South Ken "(USK)
idea, and in particular was
the only Council member to
oppose reciprocal member-
ship with RCA.
Two further questions are
bemusing ICU. Why did
Collinge support giving
" M O R A D E " £25 at Coun-
cil but oppose it at the
Union Meeting? Why after
all the obvious confusion
over the lack of coordina-
tion of distributing notices
and nearness to the start of
Term did he, at the Overseas
Students' Committee EGM,
refuse to allow seconders at
the meeting to an incom-
pletely seconded opponent
of his friend George Assi-
makis? George was there-
fore re-elected unopposed.
Perhaps too, someone would
explain why when electing
a committee originally in-
tended to host and welcome
Overseas Students at the
College the hosts are not al-
lowed to vote—only Over-
seas Students can now vote.

It is a privilege to have
the Archbishop of Canter-
bury visit IC and two of his
talks could be of particular
interest—one to the Rugby
Club and one to the H. G.
Wells Society. The visit
represents in many ways the
growing rapprochement be-
tween Science and Religion.
It is some time from the
FELIX 22 January 1969 €
heady days of the thirties
when science seemed to have
the answer to everything.
Increased affluence has not
brought increased content-
ment and the realization is
spreading that we may have
lost sight of both the mys-
tery and purpose of life.
Above all the events of this
Christmas—the richest na-
tion in the world can circle
men around the moon but
not extricate itself from a
bloody land war in Vietnam
—have given a new twist to
the old line of St. Paul; " I
may have all the knowledge
and understand all secrets;
I may have all the faitl
needed to move mountain*
—but if I have not love 1
am nothing."
