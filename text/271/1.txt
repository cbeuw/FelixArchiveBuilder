Overseas Students
Elections
The I.C. Overseas Stu-
dents' Committee, which for
the last two years has ex-
isted to look after the wel-
fare of students at the col-
lege from overseas, held its
general meeting on Thurs-
day, 9th January, and was
attended by about 100 stu-
dents.
At the meeting last term,
it was decided that the
Committee should cease to
be under the control of the
Social Clubs' Committee
and should become a com-
pletely independent organ-
isation. Last term's com-
mittee was dissolved and
the purpose of this term's
meeting was to elect a chair-
man and six other students
to form a new committee.
There were objections to
this new constitution, and
Mr. Vinod Garga said that
the overseas students ought
not to form an independent
group of their own and pro-
posed the motion that the
meeting should be trans-
ferred to the next I.C.
Union general meeting for
discussion, Mr. George
Assimakis, opposing the
motion, claimed that most
of the Union body held a
disinterested view towards
the Overseas Students'
Committee and that if the
Committee was elected at a
Union general meeting, the
result of such an election
would be meaningless. A
few questions followed and
then Mr. Garga's motion
was put to the vote, and was
defeated.
One student asked why
he hadn't been told about
this change in the constitu-
tion, and this led Mr. Assi-
makis to propose the mo-
tion that the students pre-
sent approved of the consti-
tution. But before anyone
opposed the motion, Mr.
Sam moved that the election
for the committee should
take place immediately and
any further problems could
be discussed at a later meet-
ing. Mr. Sam's motion was
put to the vote and was car-
ried almost unanimously.
Mr. Assimakis was the
only candidate for chair-
man, and there were seven
candidates for the commit-
tee. The voting slips were
collected and the meeting
was then closed.
The Committee now con-
sists of:
Chairman : G. A . C.
Assimakis.
Committee: D. Duml, A .
Doktas, D. Goodall, C.
Robinson, Miss R. Shakir,
A. S. Sittamoalam.
Minibus Smash —
none hurt
Eight members of the
Cross-Coun!ry C«ub were
fortunate to escape unhurt
when the R.C.C. Transit
minibus skidded into a
ditch near Grantham, Lin-
colnshire, on the 11th Jan-
uary. The min5
JUS suffered
extensive damage to its
bodywork ; but none of the
occuants suffered any
more than minor bruising.
The accident occurred on
a deceptive bend at the bot-
tom of a hill. Geoff Pear-
sc-n, the driver, was unable
to control the vehicle on the
slippery road surface and it
ran off the road on the inside
of the bend, eventually
wheeling round to a halt. No
other vehicles were involved
and it is fortunate that the
three in the front were wear-
ing safety belts or they might
have been thrown out.
Police later gave the club
a lift to Grantham station,
calling in, en route, at the
police station for cups of tea
and minor first aid.
The minibus is at present
in a garage at Grantham
awaiting inspection by the
insurance assessors. The
vehicle is fully covered but
there may be some loss on
insurance and loss of profit
while it is out of action as
well as inconvenience to
clubs looking for transport.
The R.C.C. Transport Com-
mittee will inform user clubs
when the transport situation
is back to normal.
Geoff Pearson has now
been removed from the
minibus driving list and the
Cross County Club, because
of this and previous inci-
dents when the vehicle has
been in their care, have been
banned from using the
Transit.

IJC. APPEAL
Imperial -College launched a £2 million public appeal
for student and staff acccommodation and for academic
and general purposes, at a press conference on Thursday,
9th January. The appeal has been quietly suckling itself
for over a year and the conference was the first public
announcement of its existence.
Whencontacted lastweek.
Air Vice Marshall A . A .
Adams, the Resident Cam-
paign Director, said that
"organisationally the thing
is developing nicely " and it
is believed that an appreci-
able sum has already been
collected. Air Vice-Marshal
Adams hopes that the bulk
of the«money will be in by
the end of the appeal year
with covenanted gifts pro-
viding a steady influx of
capital over the next seven
years.
Of the £2 million being
asked for, £1,100,000 is
needed for immediate resi-
dential building and conver-
sion. This includes £200,000
for student houses providing
accommodation for 130 stu-
dents, £200,000 to acquire
and convert property for 45
staff flats and £700,000 for
further halls> of residence in
Princes Gardens to house
275 students. A further
£200,000 is needed for the
development of the College
Field Station at Silwood
Park. The remainder of the
money, £700,000, is required
for academic and general
purposes.
The College is almost
completely without any en-
dowment and needs some
free funds which it can
direct whenever the needs
and opportunities arise,
in order for it to main-
tain Us standards of
academic excellence. A
little money at the early
stages makes all the differ-
ence to the success of pro-
mising new ideas, and this
money is little and thinly
spread at the moment.
Sights high
Opening the press con-
ference, Lord Sherfield,
Chairman of the Governing
Body, outlined the back-
ground to the appeal and
admitted " we may seem to
have set our sights high, but
the target is not high in re-
lation to the need." He
went on to explain the prob-
lem at I.C. " Imperial Col-
lege is a national institution
—as such it is at a disadvan-
tage in comparison both
with the old and the new
universities. In comparison
with the old it has no en-
dowment, in comparison
with the new it does not en-
joy local or regional sup-
port."
Lord Penney stressed
I.C's connections with in-
dustry and went more deeply
into the problems of financ-
ing research and the valu-
able contribution to the
agricultural economy made
at Silwood Park. The
"Strong Home Team." how-
ever, was caught a little off
base when questioned more
about our help to industry.
There was more than a little
"um-ing" and "ah-ing"
When they were asked to
name people from I.C. who
had proved invaluable in
industry.
Another speech came
from Professor Lighthill, the
Royal Society Research Pro-
fessor at college, who could
speak from a more detached
point of view than most
others, because he is neither
an old student nor has any
formal academic responsi-
bilities here.
Finally a speech from
Union President Rex Lowin
talking mainly about accom-
modation from the student
point of view and drawing
broadly on his own personal
experience. He explained
the residential situation and
the concepts of halls and
student houses with more
clarity than anyone else.
B.B.C.
The response from the
press was not good, and
Ann Nolan, the college
Press Officer, was disap-
pointed at the small at-
tendance by representatives
of the National Press. How-
ever, the appeal was given
reasonable space in what
can be termed the "quality"
papers and the BBC have
broadcast interviews with
Lord Penney and Rex.
So the appeal is launched;
I.C's first public appeal for
money since 1945. It is re-
grettable that a " national
institution " like I.C. should
have to beg for money in
this way but if we are to
Alb'
Concerts
Ents nlans for their Al-
bert Hall concert, on the
27th February, were turned
UDside down last week when
the Ronzo Dog Band, who
would have been the main
draw, exercised a clause in
their contract which enabled
them to opt out up to six
weeks before the event.
They beat the deadline by
one day.
After this Ents are left
with Joe Cocker, Spooky
Tooth, Free, the college
group, Smile, and compere
John Peel. They are trying
for the young" Rascals., Last
week-end there was serious
talk of trying for Cliff
Richard (!).
Carnival have obtained
Spencer Davis, East of
Eden, the Herd and the
Love Affair for their Albert
Hall concert the week be-
fore.
Felix
regrets
Due to the desperate finan-
cial position of FELIX and
the increased costs of our
new printers, the drastic
step of a price increase has
been taken.
From the next issue
F F / J X WILL COST SIX-
PENCE.
The price of FELIX was
last raised in 1957 from 3d.
to 4d. so we hope our
readers will not baulk at
contributing another 2d. a
fortnight to a worthy cause
remain on equal academic
footing with such progres-
sive heavily backed institu-
tions as MIT and Caltech.
then it is necessary. The
Government having financed
the 1953 Jubilee scheme for
expansion (which is now
three-quarters completed) it
is understandable that we
cannot expect further aid
from the Exchequer for
our present needs.
We, as students, shoulJ
support this appeal in prin-
ciple if we can't support U
in any other way. That it
is in our own interests can
be plainly seen—just look '
at the total required for
student accommodation.
