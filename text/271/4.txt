4 FELIX 22 January 1969
At the beginning of this term, a meeting of the Publi-
c itions Board was held, basically to discuss FELIX. The
Publications Board is a sub-committee of Union Council
and is made up of the Executive, two reps from council,
Lilas Campion and Piers Corbyrs, as wall as the editors of
Felix, Phoenix and the Union Handbook. At this meet-
ing, criticisms were made of the truth of articles which
have appeared in this paper and, more seriously, of the
general editorial policy.
In fact thsre have been minor factual errors in some
of the recent issues, but the slaff of the paper work ex-
tremely hard to try to ensure that what appears in FELIX
is the truth. Few people are annoyed more than us when
we make a mistake.
The more important item at that meeting was a
motion, later withdrawn, deploring our editorial policies
and suggesting that we publish mere articles of interest
to ttid student body. The implication that FELIX does
not publish enough articles of interest to the people of
this college is irrelevant to what I want to talk about. We
do, however, think that the material that appears in FELIX
is fairly well balanced and of general interest. The real
thing is that the Publications Board, a sub-committee of
council, was really attempting to get its view reflected in
the composition and writing of FELIX. For people in
high Union office to try and meddle with the editorial
policies of this paper surely negates the purpose of having
an independent newspaper. In order to supply indepen-
dent comment and fair reporting, FELIX should not be
in a position where it can be subjected to pressure of this
sort.
All this boils down to the composition of ths Publi-
cations Board. In "They tell me . . .," Les Ebdom ta'ki
about Piers Corbyn's proposals for reconstructing the
board. Electing ordinary students and a stiff member on
the Board would help rid ir of the "big brother" image,
but, although being a great improvement it would merely
replace censorship by the few with censorship by the
masses. The only real answer is to abolish the Publica-
tions Board. Make the editorial staff of FELIX com-
pletely free to make their own policies and, to cover the
financial aspects, let the editorial staff be responsible to
council directly for thefinancesof the paper. This would
ensure a free FELIX for all time.

T h e Plight of S o v i e t J e w s
I am writing to you to ex-
press anxiety about the
worsening situation of the
Jewish community in the
U.S.S.R. and to inform you
of the forthcoming National
Campaign week (Feb. 2nd-
8th) organised by the Uni-
versities Committee for
Soviet Jewrv, to protest
against the ill-treatment of
Soviet Jews.
The following activities
which have been planned in
connection with this week
. will interest members of I.C.
and, I hope, attract their
support.
(1) There is to be a march
from Speaker's Corner to
the Soviet Embassy on Sun-
day February 2nd at 2.30
p.m. to deliver a petition
about the plight of Soviet
Jewry. A party will leave
I.C. at 1.45 p.m. from out-
side the Union Arch.
(2) Copies of the petition
will be sent round the de-
partments and will also be
available at a stall in the
Union Main Entrance Hall
during Monday and Friday
lunch hour. The stall, which
will also display information
on Soviety Jewry, will be set
up daily during the week.
(3) A motion asking the
Union to support the cam-
paign will be presented at
tomorrow's meeting (Jan.
23rd).
(4) At L.S.E. on Wednes-
day, 5th February at 7.30
p.m. there will be a teach-in
on Soviet Jewry. Full de-
tails may be seen on posters
later.
In conclusion, I must
mention that Bertrand Rus-
sell, the late Martin Luther
King, the late Senator Robt.
Kennedy, about 330 British
M.P.s, and many progressive
liberals, radicals and com-
munists have expressed their
concern about the tragic
situation of Soviet Jewry.
May I ask all members of
I.C. to show their concern
by supporting the above ac-
tions.
Yours,
LIONEL FINKELSTEIN,
(Physics 3).

Dear Sir,
In my letter to Felix
dated 27th November, 1968,
I said that the student com-
muter zones " D " and "Sc"
were reserved only for those
people with allocated stick-
ers during college hours,
and that outside these hours
they were open to anyone.
There have been so many
cars that are not registered
with the college using these
zones, that in the case of
obstructions being caused.
the owners have been im-
possible to trace. In fu-
ture, outside college hours,
only those cars registered
with the collge will be al-
lowed to park in these
zones.
Any I.C. student can ob-
tain an I.C. General sticker
by registering his car at the
Security Office in the Beit
Hall entrance.
The majority of residents
having " S " stickers should
have their key to the lock-
ing posts by now, and after
week ending 24 Jan., none
of these people should have
an excuse for parking in
front of Southside in the
" Sc " zone. After this date
any resident found parking
in the wrong zone will be
in danger of losing his
sticker.
Yours faithfully,
D. FOSTER,
(Chairman, Residents
Parking Committee).
F A R E W E L L
Linstead bar, shown above
in action at the recent party,
will be officially opened to-
morrow. From this Friday
all are welcome to use it as
an alternative to Southside
With this issue, FELIX says
goodbye to our present prin-
ter, Mr. R. Garby of West
London Offset Co.
Mr. Garby has been asso-
ciated with FELIX for over
14 years and the editors and
staff during this period owe
much to him for his fatherly
nterest and for all the late
nights and hard work he has
put in.
FELIX wishes to thank
Mr. Garby and all his staff and
sincerely wish them all happi-
ness in the future.
Mr. and Mrs. R. Garby

i HALL ;
University Challenge from British Leylond
The Jaguar XJ6 is a product of one of the most skilful and
experienced design teams operating in today's motor
industry; it has been hailed as the most important new
British car of the decade. But in the decade yet to come
fresh challenges await not only Jaguar but all the Divisions
of British Leyland; challenges relating to future product
strategy; utilisation of facilities; market representation;
overseas expansion. And, fun-
damentally, of management
talentâ€”the availability, in suf-
ficient numbers, of intelligent,
hard-working men and women
with the initiative and drive
to lead the expansion of the
world's fifth largest motor
vehicle manufacturer from its
bases in this country.
This last challenge (and, indeed, all the others) British
Leyland invites graduates to share. We need engineers in
research, design and development, production engin-
eering, production management, technical sales and
service engineering. We need graduates of all disciplines
in financial analysis, purchasing, production control, mark-
eting, systems analysis and personnel. In all these fields
the Divisions of British Leyland have vacancies which
can employ the abilities of university trained minds.
We offer to graduates the conditions of service which are
to be expected from a large and responsible organisation.
Training programmes have been developed for all major
functions which will ensure that graduates are properly
equipped to start their careers, while salaries during train-
ing and early service are highly competitive.
But the major emphasis must be to place people in a
specific job as rapidly as possible, to demonstrate >their
ability and potential for the future. For British Leyland is at
the beginning of a long and exciting period which will
prove the ability of the British motor industry to meet and
to match a strong international challenge. We are looking
for people with the brains, the initiative and the amibition
to tackle this challenge with us.
If the prospect appeals, arrange an
interview with your Appointments
Board, as British Leyland will be
visiting your University on
Wednesday 5th and
Thursday 6th February
Our team will be talking about the
kind of organisation we are and
how you as a graduate could fit in.
