The Archbishop of Can-
terbury, Dr. Ramsev, is
visiting Imperial College,
and other colleges in the
West London Area, as
leader cf the Chrisitian
teaching week — February
2nd to February 8th. A
The Archbishop takes time off to relax
colourful and genial per-
sonality, with the knack of
bein<* photographed as the
tousled, white haired, ro-
und cleric in amusing situ-
ations, the Archbishop has
not shirked controversy.
His views on Rhodesia, di-
vorce and, most recently,
Anglican-Methodist Unity,
to mention only a few, have
been expressed forcefully.
It is a compliment to the
rep"tat;
on of the college
and the work of Christians
within it that Dr. Ramsey
is spending so much time
here—and it will be a chal-
lenge to IC students to take
full opportunity of the oc-
casion.

The Union has now
started a travel agency
through which students can
book with the German Stu-
dents Travel Service and the
Students Travel Bureau
(Italy) Ltd. At present only
Winter and some Easter

as soon as the summer pro-

sufficient demand more may
be arranged (see Felicity for

TV PRODUCTION
After years of delicate
negotiations in the hushed
corridors of Elec Eng and
and their inner sanctum of
the Union, STOIC is ready
to run, STOIC stands for
Student Television of Im-
perial College.
STOIC offers an oppor-
tunity for anybody inter-
ested in television to gratify
that interest.
Many people will already
know that the Electrical En-
gineering Department has a
studio and one camera. At
present this equipment is
operated by Technicians,
but with two more cameras
arriving in the next week or
so, full use of the equipment
can only be obtained by set-
ting up a Student Produc-
tion Team.
Three productions are al-
ready planned for this term,
and finance for them has
been promised. All that is
needed is interested people,
willing to learn about some
aspecf Of television produc-
tion, and willing to work on
one or more productions
this term, in evenings or
daytime. If YOU are inter-
ested in Camera Operation.
Producing, Lights, Make-
up, Sound Recording,

have an idea about some-
thing you would like to pro-
duce, come along to Elec
Eng, room 408, on Wed-
nesday, 29th January, at
1 o'clock. The equipment
will be on display, and the
formation of an informal
group will be discussed.
