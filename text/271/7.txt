Soldiers
With the present contro-
versy surrounding Rolf
Hochhuth's " Soldiers,"
now showing at the New
Theatre, it is interesting to
note that David Irving, from
whom Hochhuth drew his
inspiration, was once a stu-
dent at I.C.
Appointed editor of
Phoenix for the session
1958-59, Irving was sacked
from his post in February
1959 for the extreme right-
wing nature of his views.
After this he was sur-
prisingly allowed to edit
a magazine, Carnival
Times," under the general
control of the London Uni-
versity Carnival Committee,
in which publication he in-
serted an eight-page centre
section with, among other
things, an article support-
ing apartheid. The editorial
claimed that Hitler's regime
was " the first great unifying
force that Europe has
known for six hundred
years." The magazine
caused no little embarrass-
ment to the Carnival com-
mittee, and the World Uni-
versity Service, a non-poli-
tical organisation concerned
solely with the welfare of
students, in whose benefit
the carnival was run.
While still at college, Irv-
ing started his book, "The
Destruction of Dresden,"
dealing with the mass bomb-
ing of civilians in the war,
which led Hochhuth to write
" Soldiers,"

Records
(by Phemius)
Recent releases by Saga Records Ltd. on their Psyche
label are of considerable interest containing recordings of
some lesser known music and readings of poetry and prose.
Olivier Messiaen La Nativite Du Seigneur PSY 30007
Played by Alan Wicks.
Messiaen is one of the most original French composers
since Debussy and is well known in this country, especially
for his organ music.
In these nine meditations for organ, which he wrote
in 1935, Messiaen makes unconventional use of organ
colours, and has promoted the pedal part from its usual
position of merely providing a base line. Also he has suc-
cessfully exploited the rhythmic novelty which so clearly
separates his style from that of his predecessors.
Do not think, however, that this work is unapproach-
able as is so much contemporary music, since the opposite
is the case, and it flows with a spontaneity which makes it
greatly enjoyable even on a first hearing.
In this recording Alan Wicks gives a polished per-
formance on the organ in St. Paul's Cathedral, London.
Recording quality is quite up to standard but, be warned,
it will severely test any loudspeaker and show up any which
are substandard.
Stravinsky :—Complete piano music. PSY 30006.
Played by Thomas Rajna
For some peculiar reason Stravinsky's piano music
is still relatively unknown. It may be because it is a com-
paratively small number of pieces, but it is certainly not
because they are lacking in any of the qualities which have
made the composer's other music so popular.
The works on this record span some thirty four years
from 1908 to 1942, and a study of them gives fascinating
glimpses of the development of Stravinsky's musical style;
indeed they often give indications of styles later to be
expanded in large works.
The pieces are the four studies OP 7, the Serenade in
A major, the piano rag music, the Sonata of 1924 and
finally the humorous tango and the circus polka. The
latter, originally written for a young elephant is the only
piece to have been orchestrated and has since become a
concert favourite.
Tha Voice and Pen of C, Day-Lewis. PSY 30004
Cecil Day-Lewis was appointed Poet Laureate on 2nd
January 1968—for which he receives the magnificent sum
of £70"p.a. plus £27 " in lieu of a butt of sack."
On this record he introduces and reads about nineteen
of his poems; all those we hear have some connection with
Ireland where the poet feels he has his roots. Not that the
poems need explanation, however, since they are easily
understandable and, if there is a message it stands out
clearly. The most evocative is about the aunt who raised
him on new roots, as he puts it, in a nursing home. This
poem ends:
" Lord, how can it be justified?"
Most people do not buy records of poetry, but when it
comes to this one they should reconsider since it is well
worth having,
Anything to Declare?
A remarkable musical re-
vue comes to the Westmin-
ster Theatre on 30th Jan.
Written and acted by fifty
young men and women from
nineteen countries, " Any-
thing to Declare?" has been
touring Europe for the last
fifteen months.
I saw this show while
attending an international
conference for Moral Re-
armament in Caux, Swit-
zerland, last summer. It was
created by delegates to a
similar conference in 1967.
Since then it has visited
Austria, Sweden, Holland,
France and Switzerland, as
well as Liverpool and Bir-
mingham.
Jean Rey, Chairman of
the Commission of the
Common Market, said at
Caux that Europe's most ur-
gent need was to find an aim
outside its own leaders.
Only then, he underlined,
would we be able to bridge
our age-old differences and
prejudices. " Anything to
declare?" sets out to show
what that aim might be.
I have met and talked
with many of the cast. They
represent a real cross section
of Europe. The orchestra
alone comes from seven dif-
ferent countries. The cast
ranges from a German
miner, to a Swedish pastry-
cook, a Danish pop-singer to
a French steelworker, a
Swiss hairdresser to an
English radio operator.
Many are students who have
postponed or interrupted
their studies because they
are convinced they are doing
an essential task which can-
not be left undone. This is
their most interesting cha-
racteristic—they have a real
aim in life which demands
all they can give.
They have gained much
experience in the past year
in tackling some of the
problems of Europe—whe-
ther the language disputes
in the South Tyrol, Belgium
or the Jura, industrial dead-
lock in the docks of Gothen-
borg, Rotterdam, Antwerp
and Liverpool or the situa-
tion in different regions of
France following the events
of last May.
I would recommend
"Anything to Declare?" not
just from its entertainment
standard which is profes-
sional, but also for the op-
portunity to find out how
young people from all over
Europe are tackling sticky
national and international
problems with a new per-
spective, and having great
fun doing it!

GEOFFREY CRAIG
Saga PSY 30002
The Ginsbergs a* the ICV
Allen Ginsberg is one of
the leading poets to emerge
from the Beat Generation
and is well known in this
country. His father, Louis,
is the other Ginsberg on this
record. Louis has been writ-
ing poetry since World War
one, and is a notable poet
in his own right. His work
has been published in the
Times and the New States-
man, and is a member of the
Board of Trustees of the
Poetry Society of America.
This recording was made at
the ICA during their visit to
this country in 1967.
Allen Ginsberg's works
are long and rambling,
declaimed with great vi-
gour in an inimitable
style. Allen's first piece is
not a poem, but an Invoca-
tion to Saraswati, Goddess
of learning, poetry and
music, a chant accompanied
by himself on an accordian,
or something that sounds
like an accordian. There
follows " Iron Horse," a
poem written on the train
between San Francisco and
Chicago, then another (on
the bus between Chicago
and New York, an a.ppen-
dix), and last, a poem writ-
ten on and about Wales. AH
of these I enjoyed.
I think that enjoyment of
Louis Ginsberg's work must
come more easily to many
people — his short, con-
trolled poems have more in
common with the poetry one
heard when younger than
with his son's. Louis Gins-
berg's poetry is enjoyable in
a different way altogether.
The difference is that of a
generation which changed
the face of poetry.
What struck me most was
the respect of father and son
for each other ; despite large
and manifest differences not
only of age, but of belief,
opinion and outlook. The
understanding a toleration
of one for the other shows
them friends, as father and
son rarely are. For this,
almost as much as for the
poetry, I found this a de-
lightful album.
Elektra EKSN 45051
Apricot Brandy—
Rhinoceros
The musical press has
been full of stories of musi-
cians from different groups
getting together to play,
and the imminent demise of
groups as we know them.
Rhinocerous is one of the
new-style groups. " Apri-
FELIX 22 January 1969 .[
cot Brandy " is an instru-
mental, and after what we
had been told to expect, it
is hard to become very ex-
cited about it. While the
playing is good, and accu-
rate, the tune itself is rather
uninspired. More to my
liking was B side. " You're
My Girl (I don't want to
discuss it), whkh features
a very distinctive voice
and raises my hopes that
the Rhinoceros album (to
be released soon by Elek-
tra) will turn out to be just
as good-as promised.

Candyman - Fred Neil
The old folks may re-
member Brian Poole and
the Trem's version of this
song, which made Number
One'. Fred Neil actually
wrote the song, and here, at
last, released as a single,
is his rendering.
Fred Neil's voice grows
on one with exposure,
and I like these songs
much more than I did at
the time of our previous re-
view. The voice particu-
larly carries " The Water is
Wide."
