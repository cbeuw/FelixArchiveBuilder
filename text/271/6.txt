What you can see at the
I.C.A.
The LirJjii has now
joined the Institute of Con-
temporary Ails, under thi
ICA's Group Membership
scheme. So hurry, hurry
along to the friendly I.C.
Union Office where you will
receive the membership
card necessary to get you
into ICA. All you need is
your current I.C. Union
card.
The ICA Group Mem-
bership will enable you to
go to films, shows, poetry
readings, stuff like that,
which Mr. Man-in-the-
street can't get in to. Soon
details will be put up in the
Union Lower Lounge. At
the moment ICA are show-
ing "In the Year of the
Pig," the film about Viet-
nam, reviewed in Felix last
term (back numbers from
the Press room). There is
also the exhibition of
Japanese modern art called
" Fluorescent Chrysanthe-
mum."
The name is derived as
follows — the chrysanthe-
is an ancient imperial sym-
bol of Japan, and the fluo-
rescent is the plastics and
paints that many Japanese
contemporary artists use.
This exhibition is well
worth a visit; it covers
many art forms—there are
graphics, films, sculpture,
poetry and music, and
several flashing machines.
The high standard of work-
manship that one associates
with the Japanese is evi-
dent throughout this exhi-
bition, which demonstrates
that, contrary to popular
opinion, Japanese contem-
porary art does not consist
simply of the same styles as
Western work, but has an
original and unique flavour
of its own.
The ICA is situated on
the Mall near Admiralty
Arch. The best way from
here is to take the tube to
St. James' Park, and bear
right after crossing the
bridge in the Park. Thanks
are due to External Affairs
for obtaining this Group
Membership for us.
Incidentally, indefatig-
able Pie^s Corbyn has not
been idle over Christrms.
He has made arrangements
with the Arts Lab, so that
you (as a member of USK)
can join for 15/- instead of
the usual £1. For this you
will need to apply by a
form from tlie Union
Office.
