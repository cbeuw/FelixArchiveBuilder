The Hyde Park Relay
takes place on Saturday,
15th February, and this year
18 foreign teams from Bel-
gium, France, Germany, and
Holland have stated a wish
to compete, making this the
largest such event in the
world. Since they have to
stay in London on the Fri-
day and Saturday nights, the
organisers are trying to ac-
commodate as many as pos-
sible in Hall.
If you are going away
sometime during February,
perhaps you could choose
that particular weekend and
offer your room for this pur-
pose, by informing your
housekeeper as soon as pos-
sible.

BADMINTON
The Men's first team had
a very good start to the se-
cond half of the season,
beating King's lst's in a
very close, hard-fought
match. With three games
to play, the score was
3-3 and it appeared that
Kings would win the match.
The 1st pair, J. Langley and
C. Tyler took the court and
convincingly won their game
asainst King's 3rd pair.
Then the 2nd IC pair, J. M .
Burley and P. Lannen, the
latter having his debut for
the IC team, were just as con-
vincingly beaten by King's
1st. So the score stood at
4-4 as the IC 3rd pair pre-
pared to play the King's 2nd
pair. P. Poyser and P.
Stevenson raised their game
admirably and, in spite of
the nervous tension which
could be felt by those watch-
ing as well as the players,
succeeded in clinching the
match 5-4 for IC. Un-
doubtedly one of the best
plaved matches this season.
The mixed team beat LSE
on the first Saturday of term
by 6—3. Team : Miss P.
Horrocks and C. Tyler,
Miss I. Beynon and J. M .
Burley, Miss R. Date and .

Ist.XI beat Q.M.C.
lOCCER
I.C. Ist XI 5 Q.M.C. Ist XI 4
The first game of the term was a league match against
).M.C. who are also challenging for the Premier League
championship. As the match at Q.M.C.'s ground had
resulted in a one-all draw, it was obvious that the return
at Harlington would be close.
I.C. opened the first half very determinedly and soon
T. McCardle had opened the scoring with a well taken goal.
Within the next half-hour, McCardle had scored two
further goals. However, Q.M.C. were still playing chal-
lenging football, and helped by mistakes in the L.C.
defence, were able to score three goals before half-time.
A rather dejected X I lined up for the second half, but
soon with the defence determined to atone for their mis-
takes, the whole team was playing with its early confidence.
With A. Clarke and J. Cannar prompting the forwards from
the full-back positions, it was only a matter of time before
I.C. scored again. The goal came when D. King fastened
on to a good ball from R. Horlock, who was having his
best game of the season, and hit an unstoppable shot. I.C.
scored again when King was brought down in the area
and R. Dixon confidently scored from the spot.
Q.M.C. still did not give up, and with about 20 minutes
to go scored a good goal.

LEAGUE NEWS
Last term the Club played
the first matches in the new
Southern Zone of the Na-
tional Universities League.
In this Southern Zone which
was only started last term
the club has had mixed suc-
cess.
In general the matches
have been very close but
quite often we have been
unlucky. It is possible to
lose by just a single pin out
of a team total of 800 in
each of the three games and
get no points at all.
On several occasions we
bave been narrowly beaten
by a few pins after some
really close games.
Until the last match of the
term the three college teams
had a joint position of third
in this league, but in this last
match we fell badly. This
was against Portsmouth, the
league leaders and after
travelling down there it was
found that the Navy had
taken over the whole bowl
for a National tournament,
even though Portsmouth had
booked lanes for our match.
An alternative venue was
found at Havant about 10
miles away, and the 0-4,1-3,
0-4 thrashing we received
there can perhaps be partly
attributed to this messing
about there.
With only one fixture left
out of London, and there-
fore less travelling, we can
perhaps hope for better
things this term.
Christmas
Gliding
An expedition from I.C.
Gliding Club spent Christ-
mas week at Portmoak, near
Kinross, where the club's
Skylark 4 and a Dart 17 are.
On two occasions Frank
Irving took the Dart to over
9,000 feet in wave lift, while
Tim Tuck persuaded the
Skylark to over 8,500. In
addition to this, the Skylark
spent about 15 hours on one
or other of the two magnifi-
cent ridges, Bishop's Hill or
Bonarty. All members of the
expedition greatly enjoyed
the visit which is becoming
an annual event.
During the last term the
Skylark spent quite a few
weeks away from Lasham,
visiting other sites in search
of some hill-soaring. Des-
pite winds in all the wrong
directions two of our mem-
bers managed to soar the
ridge at Dunstable, one of
these collecting both the
qualifying flights for his
Bronze C certificate. At
Challock, in Kent, another
even managed to find ther-
mals in November, an un-
usual occurrence in this
climate of ours.
Quite apart from being
very enjoyable, these visits
to strange sites are intended
to keep our more experi-
enced pilots in practice dur-
ing the winter, ready for
next summer's cross-country
season. The Skylark covered
over 700 miles last year and
it is hoped to exceed this
next summer.
At Lasham, instruction
continues in the two-seater
Eagle every week-end, wea-
ther permitting, up to Easter
when there will probably be
one or two courses for the
pilots under training.
HOCKEY
I.C. 4 Hatfield T.C. 0
The first XI started the
second half of the session
with a well deserved victory
against Hatfield. On a Sa-
turday when the vast ma-
jority of hockey fixtures in
London were cancelled a
great deal of credit must go
to Arthur and his staff for
producing such a good
pitch. Both defences tackled
hard in the first half, but
I.C's forwards were more
constructive and Hayward
scored the first goal after
some good work on the right
by Sargent and Manning.
Then on the stroke of half
time Comyn scored a second
goal from a short corner.
In the second half I.C.
continued to dominate the
game and the third goal
came from the inside left.
Walker, following a long
corner. The climax of the
match came when Manning
slotted home a shot from a
narrow angle practicallv de-
capitating the opposition
jToalkeeoer in the process.
The Hatfield defence was
now completely demoralised
and I.C. should have scored
several more goals and, but
for a woeful lack of cohe-
sion, in the forward line,
would have done so.
The strength of any club
is based on its lower elevens,
and it is regrettable that we
have had to abandon both
the fourth and fifth elevens
due to the lack of support.
It is hoped that the three
elevens, which we are run-
ning this term will be fully
supported.
1st XI team last Saturday :
Townsley; Burtt and
Comyn; Sargent, Hill (Capt)
and Giddings; Manning,
Mudan, Hayward, Walker
and Rodger.

Hewlett-Packard lead the field in
the research, development and ma-
nufacture of some 3,000 different
types of electronic instruments, 70
of which are manufactured at the
South Queensferry Plant; some 25%
of total production was designed
locally.
The current fields of interest are the
design of measuring equipment for
use in connection with microwave
communications and the applic-
ation of digital techniques to signal
generation and analysis. Particular
emphasis is placed on the design of
computer-compatible instrumenta-
tion systems.
We are an expanding organisation
and our salaries and conditions of
