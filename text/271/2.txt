At present, Carnival is a quarter of the way to its
£10,000 target with about £2,500 made. This figure
includes £950 made from collecting, about £150 from
direct donations and an anticipated £1,400 from the Walk.
However, about £450 of this last item only has come in to
date, and it is important that the remainder be collected
and taken to the Carnival Office as soon as possible so
that the figures can be finalised.
Breaking these figures
down into constituent Col-
lege totals shows R.CJS.
about £50 ahead of C&G
on collections, and prob-
ably another £200 o\ the
walk. However, on a per
capita basis, Mines are well
ahead of both.
COMPETITIONS
This term sees the start of
the competition between de-
partmental years. During
the spring term in 1968, one
year in Guilds raised £600 to
take the only prize being
ccerea—40 gallons of bee
but this year, the committee
has decided to offer more
prizes based on the number
of people in a year. The
divisions for this are years
with less than 40 people,
years between 40 and 80
and years with more than 80.
Targets have been set for
these groups of £200, £400
and £500 respectively, and
years making half of this
target will automatically re-
ceive one, two and three
barrels of beer respectively.
For the years in each group
making most in excess of its
target, there will be further
prizes to the value of £25,
£50 and £60 respectively.
The " year's money "
will consist of everything di-
rectly attributable to the year
—walk, collections, raffle
and anything else the year
does to raise funds. The
competition will end on the
last Wednesday of the last
week of this term and the
prizes will be distributed im-
mediately afterwards.
The money raised to date
will, of course, count to-
wards the prizes.
There will also be a prize
of £15 cash and a " pot for
the individual who makes
the most during the compe-
tition.
These figures only consti-
tute the basis of prizes, and
the Committee will consider
individual cases as the com-
petition develops.
Procession
The procession that we
had hoped would take place
in February has been aban-
doned following notice from
the police that it should be
at 1 o'clock on a Sunday
morning in Hyde Park with
the vehicles keeping up a
steady 30 m.p.h.! There
.seemed to be little purpose
in this.
Carnival Queen
The Carnival Queen com-
petition sees the official
entry of the University of S.
Kensington to Carnival. En-
tries are expected from vari-
ous colleges around South
Kensington who are partici-
pating in Carnival, particu-
larly the R.C.M. which had
six people in the walk and
is holding a number of
concerts for us. The elec-
tions will take place at the
Carnival Discotheque on
February 18th, and it is
hoped to have various celeb-
rities at the event.
Discotheque
The discotheque is one of
the events of Carnival Week
which is from the 17th to
the 22nd February. On the
20th is the Albert Hall con-
cert which should be final-
ised by the time this edition
comes to print, and the
Carnival Hop takes place on
Saturday 22nd.
Festival & Fete
Looking ahead to the
third term, from the 3rd to
the 10th May comes the
Carnival Arts Festival—a
melange of concerts, drama,
films, an international even-
ing and who knows what
else. May 10th is the date
for the fete, for which ap-
peals will be made from
time to time. For the pre-
sent we would be grateful
for crockery and old, clap-
ped out pianos.
Magazine
The Carnival Magazine is
not progressing as well as
was hoped and is at present
in dire peril through lack of
advertising. However, con-
tributions are still needed—
the producers are planning
their masterpieces on the
lines of light hearted Punch
cum Private Eye cartoons.
Articles and photographs
would be greatly appre-
ciated. It is also hoped to
bring out a reprint of the
1965 smash-hit Carnival re-
cord at the start of the third
term.
RAFFLE
To date, the raffle has
realised just over £50, and
could be one of the largest
money-makers if every stu-
dent sells a ticket to every-
one they can think of. If
each student sells the one
book they were given at the
end of last year, it would
mean a profit of £1,000. If
you've sold yours please
hand the money in to your
year rep; and, if not, try to
remember where you threw
it, and sell as many of the
tickets as possible.
This covers the Carnival
news at present—it only re-
mains for the years to start
winning this ale (or what-
ever they would prefer), for
everyone to be happy.

FOREIGN STUDENTS
AT MINES
Representatives from Os-
trava, Czechoslovakia; St.
Etienne, France; Trond-
heim, Norway; Clausthal,
Germany; and Delft, Hol-
land visited the college for
the Mines Foreign Students
Week at the end of last term.
The Czechs arrived on Sa-
turday and were guests at
" 22 " dinner—they later be-
came European Champions
of Cock - Cock - Cock-a-lee-
qui! On Sunday all were
eventually found — usually
by accident — except one
Dutchman who had missed
the boat! After an invasion
of Southside bar, the pro-
ceedings were adjourned to
the President's room in
which a suitable beverage
had been installed for the
occasion. The singing of
"Old Macdonald's Farm"
was accompanied by irate
phone calls from the
Mews.
The official programme
took over on Monday with
the visitors being introduced
to the Dean, who introduced
them to the R.S.M. and
sherry. Tony Mason found
the missing Dutchman wan-
dering aimlessly around the
RSM. In the afternoon,
everyone wandered aimlessly
around the RSM before the
party in Weeks with its de-
vastating punch;-'
Liquid Lunch
Tuesday started quietly—
it had to—with a visit to
Enthovens where a liquid
lunch was provided by Pete
Harding, an ex IC president.
From there to the varsity
match which inconsiderately
started before closing time,
thus accounting for the
party's late arrival.
The evening's entertain-
ment was Christmas Wine
Hall Dinner.; followed for
some by bowling and for the
Norwegians-by a trip to the
fleshpots of Soho.
More Liquid
Wednesday morning saw
a seminar on Student Repre-
sentation, unfortunately cut
short by a prior engagement
with Charrington's Brewery.
In the evening a coach trip
to the Prospect where Bru-
nei and Surrey Universities
were outsung with a brilliant
rendition of " Old Mac-
Donald."
The next day, an early
start for Coventry colliery
where Coalboard efficiency
failed to provide safety
boots. It did, however, pro-
vide a meal that looked like
Mooney's leftovers — it
didn't taste too good either.
Carol-singing in the evening
found everyone a bit hoarse
On Friday the Mines Ball
followed a sightseeing trip
led by John Andrews, the
only responsible Minesman
still awake. At the Ball, the
President and Foreign
officer provided a drunken
cabaret and the Foreign
Students expressed their
gratitude with gifts of Boro-
vichka, Moonshine, Scotch
and a ceremonial sword
from the Germans. A fitting
end to a superb week!
R. OLLEY
UNSA Conference
In the last week of the
Christmas vacation a dele-
gation from IRC attended
the Annual General Con-
ference of the UK United
Nations Students Associa-
tion, which took place at
Nottingham University.
Lack of respect for Hu-
man Rights and for the dig-
nity of man was the theme
of the conference. Near
home in Northern Ireland
the Special Powers Act le-
gislates in such a way as to
contravene two thirds of the
UN Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. The elec-
toral system contains many
undemocratic features and
religious discrimination is
widespread. The conference
called upon Her Majesty's
Government to introduce a
" Bill of Rights " at West-
minster which could guaran-
tee full democratic rights,
and representation to all the
peoples of Northern Ireland.
The conference decided to
support the liberation move-
ments in Africa, Asia and
Latin America in their
struggle against political
repression and economic ex-
ploitation.
An emergency resolution
was introduced by IRC
" viewing with concern " the
Pope's encyclical on birth
control because of the suf-
fering it caused, in particu-
lar in Latin America.
The conference consi-
dered it of paramount im-
portance that the People's
Republic of China should
become a member of the
U N , not only because it
contains a quarter of the
world's population but be-
cause it is a nuclear power
in its own right. China,
though not at the moment a
member of the U N , should
be included in any negotia-
tions on disarmament.
The conference ended on
a more sombre note; it was
proposed that the U N S A
Annual Dinner be abolished
and that it be replaced by
a symbolic meal of rolls,
cheese, butter and water.
This was carried — the
money saved will go towards
the charities which U N S A
supports.

Any suggestions, com-
ments or complaints are
welcome to be aired at in-
formal floor-rep. discussion
meetings. These are held
every Monday lunchtime in
the Union lower lounge,
and every Friday lunchtime
in Southside upper lounge.
Two floor-reps, will be
"informally around" to an-
swer questions (but don't
imagine seeing them is a
substitute for attending
Union meetings !).
Up to now discussions
have been centred on a mix-
ture of refectory-orientated
complaints, information on
I.C., and general discussion
on the purpose (or lack of
it) of student life. Views
on certain topics, such as
the I.C. constitution, Presi-
dent's Ball, Felix, etc., are
especially welcome, and in-
formation will be offered
about Blue Books, Direc-
tories, U.S.K., failure rates,
council meetings, and a list
of the coming meetings of
committees in the Union, at
which you are welcome to
attend.
More people could and
should go to these meet-
ings to see the floor-reps.—
use their photos to accost
them there.
