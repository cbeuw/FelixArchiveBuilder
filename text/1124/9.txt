Thought for the Day
Pretentiousness
Y
ou may have to pay your own
tuition fees these days. You might
think that your expensive-to-rent
abode is a grotty, draughty, pestilent
hole, and that the stair carpet bears a
foul, clashing pattern; a criminally dis-
torted product of the opiated 1970s
mindset. You might think that being a stu-
dent under Labour is a trial of frugality
and thrift.
If you are being entirely honest with
yourself, though, you might decide that
this isn't true any more. The inexorable
rise of silicon has come to the aid of stu-
dents everywhere. Scenes reminiscent of
the Young Ones' lounge, or Withnail and
I's Camden louse-house, are becoming
increasingly rare; bedsits have become
ever more luxurious,- campus inhabitants
are walking by on the other side when
'Bedsits have become ever
more luxurious... Marxism has
been thrown to the winds;
materialism is in...'
they sec second-hand furniture shops,
and instead investing in plush items from
IKEA. Marxism has
been thrown to
the winds,- materi-
alism is in,- the
yuppies of the mid
-1980s are, I'm
afraid, the stu-
dents of the late
1990s. Rikand Neil
would be
shocked.
I have no idea
as to why this has
happened. Is it a
product of the
recession which
separated the two
decades? Are peo-
ple, now that they
have money,
unafraid to give
to their children to
spend? If this is so,
and if we see another global slump, will
the hovels return? Will red wine stains on
designer rugs be replaced once more by
"Just jumped off Janet'
rat droppings across balding carpets?
Or is the pretentious student here to
stay? Have letters,
and more recently
email, the staple
cornerstones of
student communi-
1 cation, been
superceded by
mobile phones
and pagers? The
mind boggles at
the concept of
Jeremy Clarkson
saying, "This is the
new BMW. Sleek,
sophisticated, and
with more horse-
power than you
can shake a set of
ecture notes at."
And when will
it stop? Are single
mothers con-
demned to wash-
ing the dishes by hand, while students,
basking in the lazy relief of ever-dropping
educational standards, take part-time
"Is C i n z a n o t h e n e w l a g e r , o r

p o r n o g r a p h y ? '
jobs lo purchase dishwashers? Is Cin-
zano the new lager, or unvarnished soft-
wood a trendy form of perverted
pornography?
Then again, it doesn't really matter.
I'll be gone next year. Never again will I
have to sit in the JCR while some super-
arrogant degenerate conducts a loud
conversation in as protracted a manner
as possible via the mutogenic
microwaves of a mobile. I won't have to
watch spoilt snobs turning up their noses
at Sainsbury's sandwiches and Union
curries and buying cups of espresso for
four pounds a throw. And I won't have
to watch students walking out of Mech
Eng and hailing taxis to get them back to
their residences in Chelsea.
Best of all, though, next year I'll have
some money. All Campbell

browsing through my much
envied, rather extensive photo col-
lection; nothing better than a night in,
reminiscing. Flicking through the photos,
I'm reminded of the night of my best
friend's twenty-first; the night when a
warped male acquaintance of mine
decided to embark on a maiden voyage
of discovery - his feeble attempt to see
the world through
the eyes of a woman. T h e i n d i v i d u a l . . . t u r n e d up..

in, reminiscing!
...Rough night!!!
I press the snooze button for the
fourth time, and reach for the Panadol

to me in bursts and

I've heard it all before and I lose interest
quickly. I'm still recovering from the
events of last night and I'm already five
minutes late for my lecture on how to
pass MCQ papers, the one lecture I'd
decided to go to this week. All my friends
arc counting on me to go since they arc
