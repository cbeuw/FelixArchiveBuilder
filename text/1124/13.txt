Carmageddon II - Carpocalypse Now (PC)
The name of the game really says
it all, it's the sequel of the infa-
mous Carmagedon. The objec-
tives of the games hasn't really
changed; race against other dri-
vers but for additional points you
need to do the unthinkable. Yup
run over people.
Although in the version which
I saw you don't run over "living"
people as such (well zombies in
fact!). The graphics shows no real
innovation although using the
3 Dfx card docs make the game
run at an amazing speed. At the
end of the day; the rendering is
flat, game play lacks any imagina-
tion and most of all the music dri-
ves you round the bend. Maybe
it enhances the games by making
you want to run over more people
so that you can com-
plete the circuit as
quickly as possible!?!
Who knows!
In conclusion...
Would I buy the came?
Probably not... the
game tries to hard to
appeal to the darkside
of the players and fails
miserably... and as a
driving game it's pretty much bog stan-
dard. I rate it a poor 1 star. I would give
it a 0 star but because it uses 3dfx I
thought it redeemed itself by at least
making an effort on the graphics. Well
almost.

Sin (PC)
Activision
Having stopped playing PC first
person shooting games at
quake I feel a little bit like a
footballer that has taken a year
off after breaking their leg to
find that the team has been
replaced by weird green
aliens, sure they look differ-
ent but they still play pretty
much in the same way. Per-
haps nothing was able to dis- i f
tract me from Goldeneye on 1
the N64. Goldcneyc with its
strategy, sniper rifle and head h
shot instant kills. Perhaps the
boredom of the single player I
quake without the eye candy \
supplied by a decent 3D card
bored me too much. Either /
way was sin to reawaken my ^
bloodlust ?
So onto the story. You play
a cop. The bad guys are commanded by
a sort of anti-Lara. A big, bondage out-
fitted, anatomically unfeasible, incredibly
well armed, anti-Lara. You go after the
anti-Lara with an assortment of bullet
spitting, death dealing weapons. It must
have taken them all of minutes for some-
one to think that one up, and highly
likely the chief designer has having a nice
dream all about it at the time.
So off the story and into the game
like a mad vole chased by an escaped
mink. Problem number one was the
ancient PC at home. So it runs on a Pen-
tium 120 MHz , with a monster2 video
card at 640x480 and it only complains
about it at the beginning but for a slicker
frame rate don't consider anything less
than a 166 MHz Pentium ( I
guess most of PC people at IC
will have this, but just don't
even try your old overclockcd
486 with this.) The game starts
with a nice helicopter level,
where you can forget about
ammo levels and just waste
anything that moves on the
roof of the bank. The level also
sorts out that the humour is
going to be very Duke Nukem,
with baddies taking potshots
at the local winged life and
discussing their last killing as
your gunship creeps up
behind them, the first level
also introduces the non-linear
aspect of the game. Blow one
of the adboards on the roof
and you can watch it hurtle
through a glass skylight. Wan-
ton destruction is good you might well
think. Well yes and no, after the initial sat-
isfaction has passed you might well dis-
cover that the adboard
has broken one of the
security computers that
could help you out later.
Finish the first stage
and you get into a more
recognizable game. It is
back to limited ammo
and complete freedom
of movement in the
level, run around and
shoot things that move
game. Except this time
the enemies can either
be pounded in their
armour jacketed stomach for a few sec-
onds or sent to Valhalla quickly with a bul-
let between the eyes. As the instructions
say if they're not bleeding they're not
hurting.
There is also a small, with an empha-
sis on small, amount of puzzle solving
and strategy to work out.
So does it take me from my beloved
Goldencyc. Unfortunately with problem
one to contend against it's a very strong
no. Getting round problem on meant giv-
ing it a go on a network using a P2 400
MHz machine running exotic addons
courtesy of Activision and with this setup
possibly yes. It does look impressive, has
some pretty good touches and network
wise means you don't have to play
against your friends using the same TV
screen (not so funny on a 14inch
portable). Its definitely my PC shooter
now (though I'll be looking at Quake2
with the expansion pack and Klingon
Honour Guard next week).

Colony Wars -
Vengeance
I liked Colony wars despite what the
others said. The missions were a little
same after the while but the hype
machine is back with Vengeance (heh
heh a pun). I ollowing on from the six
endings of the original, things have
got bad for the league and civil unrest
and general disorder have become
the order of the day, bit like a house
party at 3am. This time you play
Mortens fighting on the side of a navy
attempting to reunite the people and
making sure they get the N52 home
before they set off another fire extin-
guisher. It looks like its going to be a
guess who your enemy really is game,
as you battle through a new graphics
engine using your 22 new weapons,
with 75 different ships and other bits
and bobs. It should be out on the 13th
November for the Playstation, and
hopefully Psygnosis will lend us a copy
to give it a proper go.
Carmageddon 2 -
Carpocalypse Now
I'm not going to comment on the review
above, mainly because I've not played
the game yet. PC not really up to it.
One thing you can almost guarantee is
the press are going to throw their 'Are
computer games violent and the cause
of all of modern life's woes'. Since
Space Invaders this story has been
brought up mainly to give free publicity
and sell a few more games for the soft-
ware makers and publishers and to fill a
few more inches in games pages and I
for one am not going to panda to the
stainless/Sci publicity bandwaggon and
mention anything about it - doh.
