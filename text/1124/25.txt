Director: Joe Dante
W
ant to see more of the Bill
Clinton sex scandal but would
like it to be a bit more interest-
ing? Then go to the cinema some time
soon. Just when you thought you had
got away from the Stargate sex scandal
here comes Primary Colours. It's slightly
more interesting than watching four
hours of Clinton talking about BJ's but
not much.
You have a story based loosely on
the rise of Bill Clinton to the American
presidency. John Travolta plays Jack Stan-
ton, an American governor from 'down
south' who wants to become president.
It is a film about sex scandals but it does
try to touch on some sentimental issues
regarding relationships towards the end.
There was a promising mix of talent
in this flick but the best was Kathy Bates
as Libby, Stanton's lesbian political pro-
tector. But then again, has she ever given
a bad performance? Emma Thompson
was adequate as the president's wife
but the accent wasn't up to scratch. Tra-
volta eased into this role if not a little too
comfortably. He also looked remarkably
like the current Ametican president.
This film is classified as a comedy but
You're reading ic Radio
it is more of a drama with one-liners
dropped in here and there. When these
one-liners appeat they are witty. Don't go
and see this and expect to get action or
a well thought out plot because it isn't
there. This is more the sort of film
required on a Sunday afternoon when
Remind you of anyone.....?
there is nothing better to do.
If you want to know how 'they' get
away with things but don't want to resort
to the conspiracy theory then watch this
film.rj

COMPETITION
WINNERS
F
rom the mountain of correct
entries received for last week's
Exorcist competition, only five
could be victorious. The first five lucky
names out of the virtual hat were:
Ketan Gudka
Ay Lin Kho
Samuel Taniere
Peter Daplyn
Paul Chambers
They all correctly identified that The Exor-
c/sfwas first released in 1973 (December
25th to be precise), and thus this week's
re-release commemorates the twenty-
fifth anniversary of one of the greatest
horror movies ever made.
Please drop into the Felix office (in
the Quad archway) as soon as possible
to pick up your tickets.
IC Radio: from South Kensington to the World!
C Radio has at last
got its arse into gear
(aren't suppositories
great!) and is broadcast-
ip ing again. OK, saying
lb we're broadcasting is a
bit of an exaggeration, considering if
you want to actually pick up IC Radio
you have to have a satellite dish the size
of Wales and be sitting next to the Dj in
our studio (if you want to try to perform
a miracle, try picking us up on 999am).
I lowever, our clever technical manager
has wired us up to all the kitchens in
Southside halls, as well as to the JCR
(although it's not actually working yet).
Consequently, listening figures peak
when the station manager decides to
tune in.
I lowever, this is all set to change. IC
Radio is currently experimenting with
Internet Broadcasting, whereby we will
able to broadcast to the whole wide
world, all from our studio next to South-
side Shop (how exciting!). IC Radio was
one of the first radio stations to start
broadcasting over the Internet back in
1990, but its potential was never realised
and the project failed. I lowever, due to
the explosion of the Internet we are giv-
ing it another go, and are now broad-
casting in Real Audio every lunchtime
between 12 and 2pm. This will be
extended to 24 hours a day when we
work out how to
do it. Although
we are initially
limited to an
Internet audi-
ence of 25, if the
project proves
successful we
will extend our
maximum audi-
ence ad infini-
tum.
If all these
grand plans do materialise, then we are
going to hold the mother of all parties to
launch the venture- and you're ali invited
(along with some of the big cheese
music industry bods, local and national
press, and that bloke that got sacked
from Blue Peter to provide refreshments).
So, if I were you I'd start thinking about
what to wear.
I was walking through halls the other
day and it dawned on me that a lot of
people don't actually know what IC Radio
is about, so as I have some space left I'll
try to set the record straight. We are run
entirely by students, for students (we
can't afford sab-
baticals). Any-
one can take
part in the radio
- you can get
trained up and
have done your
first solo show
within a week of
popping your
face in the door.
If your enthusi-
asm is more
towards the club DJing side of things, you
can get involved in discos. Despite its
name, DJ's from all musical backgrounds
are involved. As well as doing external
functions (for which you get paid), you
can DJ in 'Ihe Backroom' in Southside Bar
(free beer and pizza), and if you're into
electronic music you may be able to join
Alick at the Union with the Electric Cafe.
You can contribute to IC Radio in
another way even if you don't want to be
directly involved. By phoning 58085 or
58100 you get a line directly to the radio
where you can make requests for your
favourite tunes, or enter one of our fab-
ulous competitions.
Another way that you can get
involved is to join our music team. This
is a group of people that get together
once a week to fill In the reaction sheets
that let record labels know what we think
of their music. No matter what your taste
in music you can take part - from jazz to
jungle, reggae to rock. People who work
on the music team get to go to free
gigs, and get free CDs. A position on the
music team means that you can get to
sample what its like to be a part of IC
Radio but without too much commit-
ment or responsibility.
If you want to listen to IC Radio over
the Internet, our web address Is
Http://lcradio.su.Ic.ac.uk. We're currently
broadcasting every weekday from 12-
2pm. To Join the music team just pop Into
the radio station next to Southside shop
at any time, and ask for Steve.
