BG WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHER OF THE YEAR
Natural History Museum
Elephant Seal Pup, Edmund Fellowes
An adorable portrait of a

apparent meditation.
A
t first glance, this is perhaps not
the most obvious venue for an
art exhibition. However, if you
bypass the foyer of reassembled
dinosaur skeletons and cross the corridor
of prehistoric fossils, you reach a dark-
ened gallery from which obscure bird
squawks and animal howls emanate. Let
me reassure you - these recorded bursts
of commotion are purely atmospheric,
setting the scene for a collection that glo-
rifies the natural world.
The museum recently unveiled the
results of the fifteenth annual wildlife
photographer competition, organised by
BBC Wildlife Magazine. Enthusiasts from
some 60 countries battled for this pres-
tigious title, coveted by amateurs and
professionals alike. In excess of 20,000
entries were received and narrowed
down to the 1 SO images on display. Pre-
sented either as enlarged, illuminated
transparencies or included in a slide pro-
jection, the collection maintains the tra-
ditional standards of quality associated
with the award. Granted, the general
format of the exhibition hardly changes
from one year to the next. But then
again, why change a winning for-
mula? I he overwhelming critical
acclaim and intense public popu-
larity are proof enough of the
event's resounding success.
You don't have to be a pho-
tography expert to appreciate the
technical skills involved in produc-
ing such shots, some planned to
the last details, others resulting
from unexpected quirks of
nature. The amazing pic-
tures have a powerful
impact on the viewer, not
only as aesthetic works but
also as thought-provoking
reminders of the environ-
ment's endangered state.
You'll probably find yourself

PICASSO: PAINTER AND SCULPTOR IN CLAY
Royal Academy
w
hen the name Picasso is men-
tioned, people react in one of
iwo
ways; either with a
polite but blank
stare of incompre-
hension, or witt
self-satisfied know-
ing nod. Given the
opportunity, these
knowing nodders
will Ihcn go on lo
tell you authorita-
tively that he was a
painter, a sculptor
and a (bad) play-
wright.
If you visit the
Royal Academy
however, you'll see
something very different: Picasso's little
known pots, plates and panels. It's the
first major exhibition of his ceramics
(painted and glazed clay) ever to be
staged, and it's long overdue.
This is a fun exhibition, with cheeky
faces carved into plates, pots shaped
like voluptuous
women in ball
gowns and
Picasso's own
archaeological
creations. For the
last, he took
pieces of broken
pots and painted
on designs
inspired by
Mediterranean
myths - Zeus, the
Minotaur and lots
of bearded
Greeks emptying
amphorae of fer-
mented grapes
and generally behaving like students.
I his outbreak of upbeal works was stim-
ulated by two events - the end of the Sec-
ond World War and the arrival in Picasso's
life of a beautiful new young mistress.
As you walk into the second gallery,
a tall panel draws you over to the far wall;
the subject is
I rancoise, his new
lover (pictured
right). Her gaze is
directed over your
left shoulder; after
only a few seconds
you start to feel
uncomfortable and
glance over you
shoulder lo set;
what she finds so
interesting This
tends lo startle the
person standing just
behind you. until
they realise what
has happened and
you both grin sheepishly
At first sight the two murals in the:
fifth gallery appear to have been created
on a rainy Wednesday afternoon by
some bored undergrads with a collection
of blue, green and black marker pens.
I hey catch your eye, you stop to take a
closer look and
realise thai they are
actually highly com-
plex and detailed
pieces.
Again and again,
Picasso catches your
attention with the
apparently banal and
primitive, which then
conjures up some-
thing exquisite.
