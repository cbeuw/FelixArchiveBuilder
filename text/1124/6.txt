Letters to Felix
In Defence of Estates
Dear Editor,
I read with some concern the article
which suggested that environmental
improvements arc a waste of money.
May I suggest that in terms of Â£60 million
of development, the sums involved are
relatively small, but of immense impor-
tance in terms of completing the Libraries
development and the Sir Alexander Flem-
ing Building.
More importantly, may I remind Felix
that the College has had an appalling rep-
utation with the local planning commit-
tees and that they expect us to act
responsibely towards our own environ-
ment. The article in Felix may, if seen by
local Councillors, have sunk once again,
the sports centre development in Princes
Cadens, where maintaining a quality
environment is of the highest priority.
We in Estates Division are battling to
achieve the best facilities for IC studente.
One of the benefits of the Queen's
visit was that for two days Imperial Col-
lege Road and the Queen's Lawn was
cleared of cars and given back to stu-
dents and staff. The whole environment
was transformed - albeit briefly.
Yours
lan Caldwell
Director of Estates
Firstly, I am not suggesting that environ-
mental improvements are a waste of
money, merely that the current ones
could have been done cheaper.
Secondly, whose fault Is It that "the
College has had an appalling reputation
with the local planning committees"?
Thirdly, I am flattered that the local
council listen to the views expressed In
these pages more than to those of
Estates, but I think most people would
find It a worrying state of affairs.
Fourthly, I've never seen cars on the
Queen's Lawn, but It's nice that the cam-
pus was given back to students for two
days - does this imply that It's not usually
run for them? - Ed
A Suggestion for
Estates
Dear Felix,
An article in October's 'Westminster
Reporter' reads:
"Residents, schools and businesses
who want to mark the new millcnium by
planting a tree can now apply for a grant
for 50% of the cost of the planting."
I realise that the recently laid flower
beds were not eligible for aid under this
scheme. However, as trees do feature
in the plan for the general beautification
of the South Kensington Campus, per-
haps College will consider taking advan-
tage of the offer. Judging by the cost of
the flower beds, it could amount to quite
a saving.

Change the Music II
Dear Ed,
In replying to Tim Wright's letter In Felix
about the "indie shite" played in dBs on
a Wednesday night, I think Mark Home
has missed the point. The fact is that
every Wednesday, the same old records
are played. It wouldn't be so bad if they
weren't always in the same order, or if
the playlist had changed a bit since last
year (OK, there are one or two new
records). A lot of people have taken to
calling it "The Tape".
And surely there must be a DJ out
there with a little more imagination than
to play "Dancing Queen" as the last
record, every Wednesday!
Yours sincerely,
Paul Cole,

Spooky Coincedences?
Dear Sir,
Further to the earlier excellent articles on
halloween, I would like to say that many
cultures apart from our own dear
Celtic/Judaeo-Christian society not only
feel that this is the time for commeration
of the dead but also a festival of light -
perhaps bangs and flashes ward off evil
spirits. Not only do we have halloween,
but Guy Fawkes night probably is older
than Guy Fawkes himself, and even the
modern Armistice day appropriately falls
around this time. As I said earlier, other
cultures festivals of light fall around this
time. The later festivals may be con-
nected with the winter solstice while the
earlier ones are perhaps a natural reac-
tion to the encroachment of night into
day following the autumn equinox.
Yours Sincerely

Can anyone be bothered to teach history
to this man? - Ed

Dear Felix,
Please could you stop pissing about with
the back page -more sport less bollocks.
(A full page of a crap photocopied maze
really takes the piss.) Otherwise every-
thing Is hunky-dory.
Andrew Mayes.
Dear Felix
Considering the cross country club sent
in a full report, we thought you'd have
the courtesy to print it rather than fill the
back page (usually reserved for sport)
with Natalie Wood's irrelevant photo-
copying. Felix Sport has sunk to a new
low. The relationship between you and
the sports clubs is so bad that you'll
never get a decent sports editor any-
way. I wish Gus Paul luck.

1) We did print the cross country report,
except for one sentence which was
edited out (one sentence of sport on a
separate page would looksilly, wouldn't
It?)
2) The back page Is not reserved for
sport - It used to be sport due to printing
restrictions (the back page had to be
printed last). These no longer apply.
3) A great deal of Interest has been
shown in "Natalie Wood's Irrelevant pho-
tocopying" but, granted, the crossword
will usually be on the back page along
with any other puzzles and prizes.
4) I am quite happy to have more
sports articles - In fact, I reserve two
pages every week for sport. Strangely,
however, there never seem to be
enough contributions to fill them...- Ed
Cartoons not Comic
Dear Ed
Shame on you! I feel that I must com-
plain about the tasteless comic strip from
issue 1122. "Outcast Ben" was a failed
attempt at smutty humour. Instead, the
illustrations were crude, offensive and
unworthy of your fine publication. We
are definitely not amused...
A disappointed fan
At last! I've been waiting for complaints
about this for some time. Still, only one
complaint over a week after the issue
was published? If you don't like this
week's comic, please let me know -
And Finally...
At this point there should be a letter
from The Censors' (?). Unfortunately
no-one showed us a swipe card or Union
card when submitting the letter, so wc
are unable to print it. We still have the
letter, and will gladly print it next week,
if the author(s) come in to the office
before noon on Wednesday with some
appropriate identification.
Deadline for letters is
12noon Wednesday.
Letters may be edited
for length, but will not
be altered in any other
way. Letters need not
be signed, but a swipe
card must be shown
when submitting
anonymous letters.
