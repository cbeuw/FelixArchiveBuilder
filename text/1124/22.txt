sparkling new loos - what more

that really do shine But don't think that

Roobarb Diva Surprise feat. Georgia Jones
/ "On Top of the World" (WD
Diva Surprise live up to their name
with a wicked slice of funky, disco
house, despite the cheesy "YMCA"
sample (I). Vocals provided by
Georgiajones of Plux/Over & Over
fame - and doesn't she do well,
everyone? - clap, clap, clap.
Best Mix - Original Mix
It goes - "On lop of the world,
everybody, you can take the
world..." (Don't always rely on the
these lyrics cos I make 'em up
when I feel like it)
Been out for three weeks so go
and buy It (maybe!).
(Okav. trainspolters. so we've
nicked the last feature from Mix-
mag, but. hey, who cares?
Deep Dish feat. EBTG / T h e
Future of the Future (Stay Gold)"
(Deconstruction)
Another quality slice of trippy
house from the remix team that
brought you the best version of
Delacy's classic "I lldeaway". Check
out Deep Dish's Stay Dark Mix for
a sweeping house sound and the
Morales mix for a more conven-

Best Mix = David Morales mix
It goes - "It's so bright, tonight"
Out now
