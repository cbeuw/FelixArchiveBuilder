2 November 1998 Clubbing 23
Villiers Street, Charing Cross Road, WC2.
Fridays, £4/£8, 10.30 - 6am, capacity -
1750. No strict door policy.
Top night out. Whether you like to
wear your Marks and Spencer jumper
tucked in or prefer tight black leathers,
you'll be welcomed with open arms.
Most people, you'll find, are somewhere
in the middle. There's very little atti-
tude, unlike many clubs of this calibre.
The diversity of the crowd brings with it
a great atmosphere; people do what
they're own thing and everyone's happy.
You'd be hard pushed to find anyone
there who doesn't want to be. A line of
angel-boys in clean while vesl lops can
be found behind each bar and they're so
friendly, you're happy to pay the £3 it
costs for a beer! Kickin' beats on the
main dance floor (and one of the finest
I've seen, with a big screen to dance in
front of and everything!) and groovy
danced-up disco tunes on the other.
Many half naked podium-dancing blokes
(CK's included) can be found too if that's
your thing. Upstairs you'll find a chill out
room (not particularly chilled out but
very cool) and a quiet (almost silent)
coffee bar. Get a grip and go.

Newly refurbished since its days of
hosting some of the legendary house
nights of the early nineties, like Rage, it
has been getting lots of rave reviews in
the club music press, so I'd better oblige,
hadn't I? This place really does it for me.
I like big dubs and Heaven is one of the
larger ones here in the big smoke. It's full
of little bars and chili out areas and for
once the dance floors are big enough to
move around on. But it's not just the set-
ting that's top. It's also about those little
things that you appreciate. I he door pol-
icy is relaxed, but the people who come
here still make an effort. If only things
were like that at al! clubs. And, the
chilled-out mixed crowd art; also pretty
special - there's just no hassles, agro, or
attitude - just shiny, happy people (as
Michael Stipe said all those years ago in
that fucking annoying song).
Wildlife is the dub's own night and
despite not booking really big names all
the time, they still pull In a big crowd -
clubbers are loyal to this club, and there's
got to be a reason for that. On the music
front they play it pretty hard and chunky
(?) at Wildlife. Probably too hard for my
tastes, but still, everyone else seemed to
be going for it, and it wasn't just the
vodka-red bulls that were responsible
for that either! Worth going to over and
over again. Check out Metalheadz at
Heaven in November and John Dig-
weed's weekly Thursday night jaunt
Bedrock.
It Is where God lives, after all!

Now the first of this double
CD package is a really interesting
concept, which unlike a lot of
other experimentation in music,
actually works. Twelve of the dif-
ferent club nights which you can
sample at The tnd are each rep-
resented by a track, this gives
you a good feel of how eclectic
Ihc; Lnd is as a dub venue, fhe
range of what makes up
dance/club music. I rom the Skint
records (Fatboy Sllm's home sta-
ble;) night full ol big beats,
through Howie B's Pussyfoot
nights, to Sub-terrain with its tech-
house feel. From funky US and
CK garage courtesy ol the Sound
of the i uture crew to rap and hip-
hop from The Hop night, this is
quality all the way through - but
thing else from fhe tnd. You
even get a postcard for every one
of the nights in case you want to
tell your mates about Ihem, or
just use them to skin up with
tnd out. Quest
is that you get a second. This is
mixed by, among others, Mr. C
(Shamen guy who owns The
Lnd), and is taken from the Sub-
terrain night that has been run-
ning since the club began. The
mix has got a distinctly futuristic
feel to it. I his is serious house
music, tech house at its best - but
still full of some absolutely beau-
tiful songs. Check out Pure by
Rebirth for one of I
real house trac
<ely to hear.
