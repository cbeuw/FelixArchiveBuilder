26 Clubs & Diversions 2 November 1998
Come rain, come snow, come sleet, come hail - Nothing can stop IC's intrepid explorers.
Mountaineering
We woke up fairly early on the morning
of Saturday the 17th, crawled out of our
tents and paid the nice but insistent
man for the privilege of using his camp-
site. Since this was the Peak District, the
weather wasn't too bad: there was def-
initely a small patch of blue sky over
towards the horizon. We went for break-
fast at a cafe between the campsite and
the crags, and then stopped in the village
of Heathersage to pick up food for lunch.
This turned into a fairly long delay as sev-
eral members were gripped by con-
sumerist frenzy and disappeared into
the "Outdoors" shop, emerging with
lighter wallets and shiny new gear.
The crag at Stannage was fairly quiet,
and we were soon climbing - for many
Freshers this was their first experience of
outdoor rock. The wind at the top of the
crag was incredibly cold, so after one
route most people took a break for
lunch. It started raining shortly after two,
and after about half an hour of down-
pour we gave up on the chance of any
more climbing that day and retired to the
pub. We headed back to the campsite at
about half past five and established our-
selves in the Robin Hood Inn just down
the road.
It soon became obvious that the
whole pub was full of university climbing
clubs: Bristol, De Montfort, Oxford and
Brunell were here. Once everyone had
settled down to the serious business of
getting very drunk, with our VP, Gareth,
organising a boat race between the dif-
ferent universities. Unfortunately, the IC
team only finished third (Bristol won), but
much fun was had by all. After closing
time we returned to the campsite to
find a hard frost, but we ignored this in
the cause of inter-club relations and
stayed up drinking and watching the
stars for an hour or so.
Sunday morning was bright and
clear, but still very cold. Stannagc was
much busier than Saturday so we went
to the next crag along. We had an excel-
lent afternoon's climbing, with all the
new members getting several routes
done. As the day ended, everyone gath-
ered round the base of the crag to watch
Rob attempt to lead a fairly hard over-
hang. He backed off eventually, after
spending a long time sat on a small
ledge trying to figure out how to pro-
ceed, encouraged by several hecklers
and the occasional paper missile. We
returned to London refreshed after a
good weekend.
Fellwanderers
On Friday, after the minibus was finally
liberated from Linstead, 14 intrepid Fell-
wanderers set off on the first trip of the
year. The majority of these were suckers
from last year who should have known
better, the others innocent freshers who
now do know better. After fighting
through London and up the M l , we
finally arrived at the hostel in Crowden.
After a cup of tea, we retired before
the conversation degenerated too far. As
the dawn broke, so did a wave of
lethargy over the hostel, as the curtains
were pulled back by bleary eyed fell-
wanderers to see water - everywhere.
Most of it coming at a sharp angle
through the air due to the gale force
winds accompanying it. The curtains
were drawn again, and bodies returned
under the duvets.
Eventually, everyone was up, and
the decision made to venture into the
wetlands. This was partly due to the lack
of alternatives - the hostel was publicis-
ing an exhibition of allotments past, pre-
sent and future. So we went for a level
trek around nearby reservoirs on a dis-
used railway line. A short section along
the main road was necessary, with the
shorts wearers providing great enter-
tainment for the drivers, especially the
two girls in the mini, who gave Tim a nice
flash. Of their lights, of course. By this
time, everyone was somewhat damp, so
the unanimous decision was taken to
venture into Glossop, where some time
and money were killed at a tea shop.
Sunday was more promising, so we
walked up Black Hill. The rain mostly
held off, and there were even sunny
spells, although one group discovered
hail blown by gale force winds is not very
pleasant. The quality of the path varied
from knee deep peat to motorway qual-
ity path, although this was regularly inter-
cepted by the river, causing a few wet
feet. A walk further south in the district
was the last walking of the trip, through
and over a valley that looked a little wet-
ter than it should. The river lapping at the
farmhouse was the giveaway for that.
More cups of tea all round, then plough-
ing down the M1 in search of dinner.
A few adventures later (let's just say
we won't be going to Toddington again),
we finally settled for the good old Che-
quers pub. So, the trip drew to a close.
Very wet, but it takes a lot more than a
bit of rain to keep the Fellwanderers
down. You ain't seen nothing yet!
