IC 29 -10 Bart's
IC turned up with the usual promptness,
20 minutes before kick-off. Despite start-
ing the game playing into a gale, Will
"Stubbs" Sterns charged over for a well
deserved first try for IC.
Following that, Bart's camped on
our line, but failed to score, even though
the ref. was helping them as much as he
possibly could. Eventually the hand of
God (the rcf.) intervened and Barts
scored a lucky try.
Back came IC, displaying a blinding
array of silky skills where forwards and
backs linked together exquisitely, Tref
"Telfa" Beynan diving into the corner, just
like any good diving guru should.
After half lime, Jamie "Pieman Super-
man" Duggin, having had his pies in the
interval, flopped over the line to score
and lost the ball in his gut. "Babyshoes"
Dickenson converted to make the score
17-5
Following a few minutes of dodgy
refereeing, we managed to avoid getting
penalised and played some magnificent
running rugby from the forwards,
"Rapist" Nipply being hauled down short
of the line. "Hogger" Philip actually
passed (!) for Chris Dickenson to touch
down converting his own try.
A lapse in concentration allowed
Bart's to score, but we replied in the
final minutes for a seamless try by Segun
to cap a memorable performance and a
good win. Keep it up, fellas!
2nd XV
IC 51 - 0 Bart's
Bart's crumpled under the pressure
inflicted by IC, and will probably never
recover.
In all fairness, they were a good
team, but the IJ's steamrollered them on
the way to another famous victory. The
scoring was opened by Dunk "the
Thunk" Brett and was the cue for the
floodgates to open and spectacular tries
to be scored by Jim "the Knife" Sorpper
and Jon " the Man" Stevenson, scoring
with a beautiful jaunty try. Alex "the
Angel" Deuise scored and also slotted in
3 conversions through the posts in
almost dangerously windy conditions.
"Slick" Simon Gutterage walked
through Bart's defence, leaving them
for dead with Linfordesque pace. "Siz-
zling" Stu Catt the prop with a 10 second
100m run shot through to effectively kill
Bart's chances of respectability. Man of
the match and purple helmet of the
week belongs to Yann "the Yokel" Lewis
who egged on the side and promised
sexual favours for the win. finally Oily
"The Organist" didn't score because he
was crap.
"Slim" Jim Robinson back from crip-
pling knee injury led the team from the
front. The wheelchair proved a bit of a
problem in the line out, but he used il
to dazzling effect in the loose. Two
other tries were scored by the magnifi-
cent Flgo, back from an Lngland-U21
trial. Dunk "the Thunk"

And so the Fourths keep marching on.
Despite the shadows cast over them by
the London Student newspaper the
Fourths produced two supreme perfor-
mances to set them on the road in BUSA
and cement themselves at the top of the
division-well we must be, played 2, won
2, scored 8, conceded 0, who could have
a record better than that?
London Student's allegations were
disgraceful, firstly the line "LS have
tracked down the 4th Division pot to
Imperial College, who have been hoard-
ing the silverware since they won the title
the previous year", is utter rubbish. We
were never given the trophy, and how
can you track something down without
talking to any of the relevant people? The
whole article was trash journalism. At
least when the Sun or Mirror do an
expose they talk to the people and find
out their reaction- they might not print it
or they alter it, but at least they attempt
to contact the appropriate sides. And
calling us bastards is very unfair, though
the person with that quote didn't dare to
publish his name- though we know

where you live Rob. We have not had
"disciplinary problems" and we were not
in ICU disciplinary hearings "every week".
We had just one hearing and that was for
an over-reaction and held in front of a
kangaroo court that found us guilty
before the start... I could go on, but suf-
fice to say my barrister is taking a deep
look into the paper and if an apology is
not forthcoming we could take legal
action against LS for slander.
Onto the games, versus QM, the
squad was Dave, Nick, Perez, John, Elliot,
Bola, Adam, Dave, Simon, Gum, Tom,
Mark and Aidan, Everybody played
superbly and the goals were scored by
Dave, Gurn and a screamer of a free kick
byjohn through the 'keeper's hands. Ver-
sus UCL, who actually played with
ringers, our play was one of the best ever
by an IC Fourths squad. Every player
played their hearts out. Two additional
players came in- Richard and Stuart. Our
goal was scored by Aidan following a
screamer of a free kick byjohn through
the 'keeper's hands (!). It was cold.

Netball
So far this term the netball teams remain
unbeaten. The first team arc unbeaten
in the BUSA matches, having played LSE
(won 24-14), St Georges (won 13-9) and
mostly recently Guys, Kings and St.
Thomas' (won 33-17).
The second team played the
Malaysian team last week and won
despite a close match.
Well done everyone.
IC 4 - 0 GTK's
Firstly we would like to apologise for our
controversial comments made in last
weeks match report about the quality of
Felix (See Felix 1123, P27, Unknown IC
thirds 7- 0 ICSM). No really.
In a messy game against a crap
team we triumphed 4-0. Chris Bull led
from the front with 2 goals from Chris
Bull.
Indian Carpet Catalogue dived and
shimmed, and converted a beautiful
short corner. Steve Cram stood solid at
the back, presenting any attcmps at
penetration, much to Flltum's annoy-
ance, liltrum, although demonstrating
copius effort in the first half, still failed
to produce fluid movements. In the
second half, after a few false rumblings,
he exploded and planted one in the
back of the goal.
As a final note: (to the tune of Urn
Bongo, in a club style)
'Here comes RE-ZU-LA, everybody's
frightened,
Here comes Tommy Cantle, all our
sphincters tighten,
DISCO BOYS!'
I thank you.

ICSM 6 - 0 IC
the medic ladies stormed to victory after
an exciting match with much friendly
rivalry.
On the pitch nimble Ridgeway
dodged and weaved around the IC
defence beating the IC goalie, Corner,
to put away a fantastic first goal. Alice,
the Charing Cross striker, was deamed
Most Valuable Player after her first hat-
trick for the combined Marys-Charing
Cross team.
Skill and speed made her a formi-
dable adversary for the IC team who
were left astounded.
Other notable performances came
from Dixon and Rowland where com-
munication and passing were key in
leaving the IC girls behind.
The IC team had a few breaks in the
second half but the medics were quick
to respond in defence, powerfully clear-
ing the ball to the forwards.
All in all a very exciting game - and
much celebration in the medics bars
aftetwards.
Attention Sports Teams!
Please try to have ali your match reports
in by 8pm on Wednesday. I am usually
in the I elix office typing them up from
about 7, so just come straight in and
hand them to me. It usually helps if they
are legible. Also, there are lots of
teams/sports I haven't heard from yet.
This is your chance to tell the (college)
world about yourselves! Gus
