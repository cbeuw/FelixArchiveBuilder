agement. The flowerbed, while looking
undoubtedly resplendent, cannot be
judged in the same category; it is not a
student facility, though I suspect the Biol-
ogy Department could conceivably find
a use for it. It perfectly demonstrates
the misguided strategy of Estates and
their total miscomprehension of priori-
ties. This morning, I stood in the cold out-
side the Chemistry building twice, the
result of an alarm system that does not
work, staring at an arrangement of Chi-
nese granite
and bedding
plants, the
cost of which
would have reme-
died the problems
that I and others
have endured for
years. Ah, but the
flowerbed and
other environmen-
tal improvements
create a good
impression for
those wishing to
invest in the Col-
lege, I hear you cry
(from Suite Five).
Absolute rubbish.
What might well
have an impact on
College funding Is
the constant
interruption of
important
meetings with
potential benefactors caused by false
alarms, which has already happened.
Perhaps the Pro Rector (Research Con-
tracts) would care to pose the following
question to recent industrial donors: Did
you choose to support Imperial College
because a) it has a first-rate track record;
b) the calibre of the people is outstand-
ing; c) the research facilities are excellent;
d) the herbaceous borders are a sight to

behold? Gentlemen, I didn't come down
in the last shower, and nor did the rest
of Imperial.
lan goes on to talk about the
'appalling reputation with the local plan-
ning committees' that the College has.
Again, I am in complete agreement. I am
no expert in local government, but I
would suspect that the College's destruc-
tion of some of the finest Victorian archi-
tecture in London over the last thirty
years may, in some way, have con-
tributed to the
problem.
Thankfully,
things arc
improving. The
BMS is a superb
building, and has
made a very posi-
tive impact on the
appearance of the
College. Quite
how the flowerbed
can make any sig-
nificant difference
to the indescrib-
ably ugly Sherfield,
Biochemistry and
Chemistry build-
ings is beyond me.
The College only
has itself to blame
for the poor stand-
ing with plan-
ners. This will
only improve
as the quality
of building design takes a turn for the
better. The BMS marks the start of this,
so I feel lan is being overly pessimistic on
this front. As for the implication that Felix
is 'shooting us in the foot,1
[from corre-
spondence between Messrs Caldwell
and Baker - Ed] I am, as a chief trouble-
maker, terribly flattered. I had no idea
that I and my fellow wordsmiths had
more sway with our local councillors than

hose of you with good memories
for bad television will have the saga
of Fallon from The Colbys and the
aliens etched on your minds. Well, a sim-
ilar thing happened to me recently. There
I was, writing the first column of the
year, when suddenly I was blinded by a
bright light outlining the body of a
strange creature. My memory went
blank, but when I regained my senses
the first paragraph had been changed,
such that it very closely resembled the
equivalent piece from 1997. Very bizarre.
Not to worry, because I have since got
the local priest to give my laptop the
once-over with a cloth doused in holy
water. The things I go through for this
place.
This article is taking a lot longer to
write than usual, not for reasons of
writer's block, but more prosaically
because my fingers are bloody frozen. As
I am aware, dear reader, of your concern
for my wellbeing, let me explain. Two fire
alarms within the space of less than an
hour. TWO. Even someone as tolerant as
yours truly is bound to lose his rag over
this fiasco. Admittedly, the ineffective-
ness of the fire alarms in my department
is about as novel as the news that Ger-
many came second in 1966, but it bears
repeating as it links in nicely with the let-
ter from my good friend, lan Caldwell. Mr
C does not believe 'environmental
improvements are a waste of money.' I
agree. All these years, he has fended off
my criticism, but that agreement should
have given the old boy a heart attack. I
can think of many projects that have
improved the environment of Imperial.
For example, the JCR refurbishment has
transformed one of the most shabby,
inadequate parts of the College. The
SCR, which looks and smells like a sub-
standard school canteen would benefit
from similar investment, as would the
MDH, though any change there should
be accompanied by a change of man-
t is time to have a rant against the
powers of IC concerning their atti-
tude towards student behaviour. I
recently came across an interesting doc-
ument that describes itself as the IC
drinks policy. A fine and worthy item to
have in Sherfield's already engorged
paper-pushing bureaucracy you might
say, or if you are going to be rude you
could say that is it not worth the paper
it is printed on. This document uses
phrases such as "moral duty" in relation
to student alcohol consumption and
frankly I am confused as to how an
administration that barely tolerates its
undergraduate population would even
dream of antagonising them even more
by treating them like twelve year olds.
Either the students at IC are clever, in
which case they arc capable of keeping
a lifestyle that they can tolerate or they
are not clever, or they cannot run their
own lives and really should not be at IC
in the first place.
The situation of IC trying to control
students' lifestyle was highlighted to me
in anecdotal form:
Two hard working members of the
medics' freshers' fair were told, when
attempting to buy some medicinal vodka
to stay their flagging spirits, that a bottle
would cost in excess of sixty pounds.
They then attempted to purchase a
round of drinks for their stand only to be
told that they would not be served more
than one double per person per day. This
laughable evidence of censure by bar
staff could be dismissed, if it were not for
the discovery next day of the aforemen-
tioned document in green - the IC drink-
ing policy: I decided, lor the good of the
medical school, to investigate.
A recent former president of ICU, for
whom medicine was not a career option,
wrote this document. It contains phrases
such as 'moral duty' and 'welfare of the
students'. Frankly, I am stunned, firstly
because the College thinks that it has the
right to censure anyone's right to a drink
and secondly to put the finances of the
student union in jeopardy by reducing
profits at the bar. The only answer is to
drink at sensible medics bars where they
certainly would not let the sobriety of
the Estates Division. I suspect that this
was a slightly hasty comment, for if it con-
tains even a scintilla of truth, something
is very, very badly wrong with Sherfield.
We have dozens of well-paid people
charged with project design and plan-
ning, whereas Felix is a bunch of jour-
nalistic waifs and strays. Honestly, I ask
you.
The BBC is, in my humble opinion,
the finest broadcaster on the face of the
planet. In terms of quality, most of Aun-
tie's competitors pose the sort of threat
that Vanessa Leltz represents intellectu-
ally to Stephen Hawking. However,
recent times have been less than happy.
First, the defection of Barry Norman,
then Jimmy Hill and now the loss of the
cricket; frankly, if Richie 'God' Benaud
doesn't follow the test matches to Chan-
nel 4, I fear for the stability of this coun-
try. Even Blue Peter has not remained
immune to the problems ensnaring the
Corporation. The problem is that the BBC
is trying to be all things to all people,
rather than sticking to what it does best,
setting the standards for the medium of
television. I suspect if we scrapped day-
time television- no longer needed since
the advent of Welfare to Work- replacing
it with quality repeats, the money saved
would have met the cricket shortfall; the
daily oil slick on Kilroy exuded from the
presenter must alone costs millions each
year to deal with safely. I understand
that Blue Peter's problems are already
being addressed. Cost is not the issue
here, but rather the maturity of the pre-
senters, and the unfortunate conse-
quences that have entailed from lines of
coke that Richard Bacon made earlier.
The Beeb feels that a return to older fig-
ures, cast in the mould of Valerie Sin-
gleton and John Noakes, should do the
trick. Apparently, their first choice for
such an avuncular figure was Frank
Bough, but sadly his agent said that he
was tied up.
their customers get in the way of profit,
which is after all, the only way to run a
business. Given IC's attitude towards
handing out money to students for activ-
ities that make them look good (i.e. they
don't), it seems strange that they fur-
ther penalise the students by trying to
stop them from drowning their sorrows.
Enough random ranting; I will finish
by offering big congratulations to all the
sports teams, especially the medics, who
seem to have been doing quite well
recently. If you carry on like this you
might get in the national newspapers
and the denizens of Sherfield might get
to hear of triumphs.
