Reforming laws that will allow scientists the freedom of speech
L
argely thanks to an ongoing
high-profile campaign led by
lobbying group Sense about
Science, all three parties have
made libel reform an issue worthy of
their manifestos. The loud call for a
change in English libel laws came when
famous science author and Impe-
rial College alumnus Simon Singh was
sued by the British Chiropractic As-
sociation (BCA) for what they claimed
were “defamatory” comments made by
Singh in The Guardian.
Despite the recent news that the
BCA have backed down from the case,
effectively handing Singh the victory,
he is still several thousands of pounds
in debt. Current libel laws in England
are stifling fair debate and effective
freedom of speech in scientific issues;
it is the almost guaranteed financial
burden that scares writers defending
themselves in court.
The issue has seen much media at-
tention in recent times thanks to
Singh. The fact all three leading par-
ties are now using libel reform as cam-
paign ammunition “is a great tribute to
grassroots pressure on politicians” said
Singh.
Speaking to felix, he further empha-
sised the importance of libel reform to
Imperial’s students.
“This is an issue that should be close
to hearts of Imperial College staff and
students for a whole host of reasons.
For example, science can only progress
through open and frank discussion, but
English libel law can chill and crush
such debate. Also, unless scientists and
journalists can discuss ideas freely and
fairly, then the public will not hear the
whole truth on matters of serious pub-
lic interest,” he said.
Labour’s manifesto promises that re-
form will occur to “protect the right of
defendants to speak freely.” The Con-
servatives follow suit with an outline
explanation of their proposed plans
to tackle the troublesome libel laws:
“We will review and reform libel laws
to protect freedom of speech, reduce
costs and discourage libel tourism.”
The Lib Dems have given a more
detailed description of changes to be
made in libel laws. They will protect
scientists in open forums of debate
against unfair libel action by “requir-
ing corporations to show damage and
prove malice or recklessness, and by
providing a robust responsible journal-
ism defence.”
Despite party promises, Singh is not
content with what his court battles
have helped yield. He will continue to
campaign for the greater good of sci-
ence in the mainstream media.
“In short, it is generally acknowl-
edged that we have the most oppres-
sive, one-sided and anti-free speech
libel laws in the democratic world,” he
said. “The challenge will be to make
sure that the next government acts on
its manifesto pledge.” Simon Singh, holding the scarf, after a court battle against the BCA
S
erving a region of commu-
nities that span right across
the spectrum is no easy job.
Whoever takes up the parlia-
mentary seat for Kensington
will have to contend with just that.
The Kensington constituency, pre-
viously Kensington & Chelsea under
the old constituency boundaries, has
been a Conservative stronghold for
many years now. This is thanks to the
large numbers of affluent residents liv-
ing around South Kensington, Notting
Hall and King’s Road. Amongst them
however, sits North Kensington’s more
deprived areas and also hubs of stu-
dent residences.
MP for Kensington & Chelsea, Sir
Malcolm Rifkind, is a backbencher
with an illustrious political history
with the Tories. He served under Mar-
garet Thatcher as Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
and Secretary of State for Defence,
and even contested the leadership with
her successor, John Major in the early
nineties.
Rifkind is looking to scrap the West-
ern Extension Zone by the end of this
year.
“Extending Congestion Charging to
Kensington was always about raising
money, as opposed to easing traffic
flows,” he said.
Addressing the student body so im-
portant to Kensington’s locale was
seemingly not a priority, failing to re-
spond to felix’s questions.
In comparison, Sam Gurney, La-
bour’s PPC for Kensington was more
in tune with Imperial students’ strife.
“If elected I will seek to represent
all Kensington residents to the best of
my ability, but my focus will be mak-
ing Kensington a fairer place for all,
including Imperial students. One of
the central focuses of our campaign is
the need for more affordable housing
in the area, many local students are
forced to move away on completion of
their studies and many other Imperial
students have to commute long dis-
tances just to get to college.”
Lib Dem PPC, Robin Meltzer, looked
to draw on wider policies his party
stood for: to address the financial bur-
den all university students are saddled
with.
“The first thing to say is that the Lib-
eral Democrats are the only party com-
mitted to scrapping university tuition
fees. University education should be
free and admissions based on ability
not bank balance. We will scrap un-
fair tuition fees for all students taking
their first degrees saving them nearly
£10,000 each.
“We have a financially responsible
plan to phase fees out over six years,
so that the change is affordable in these
difficult economic times,” he said to
felix.
“[Libel reform] is an
issue that should
be close to hearts
of Imperial College
staff and students”

POOR, POOR STUDENTS
As well as their future careers beyond university, there’s also another concern for students:
the not-so-small number in red ink on their student loan statements.
An average Imperial student on a three-year course will graduate with approximately
£24,000 of debt, a sum likely to be more than a graduate scheme’s starting salary.
So, who’s promising what about the imminent dilemma that could see tuition fees rise
once again for students?
Labour
Labour will stand their ground on the basic policy their then Education Minister David Blun-
kett introduced. The party is likely to favour a lift of the cap that means students can only pay
a maximum of £3,500 a year for tuition.
Saying that, a third of Labour candidates including several prominent members have signed
a pledge organised by the National Union of Students (NUS) to oppose the lift on tuition
fees. They could hold their weight in any future debates and keep any fee hikes in check.
Conservatives
The Conservatives appear to be taking the unpopular decision to not only keep, but also over-
see a rise in tuition fees to a reported £7,000 a year.
Remarkably coy on their position on the matter, the fact is that only thirteen Tory candi-
dates have signed the NUS’s petition opposing the lift on tuition fee caps; this may be telling
evidence on their official party line.
They follow Labour’s lead in awaiting the outcomes that will be derived from Lord
Browne’s Higher Education review before making any commitments to those in higher
education. The review, which commenced in November 2009, is likely to suggest that an
increase in tuition fees is necessary.
Liberal Democrats
Nick Clegg has reaffirmed his position to scrap all tuition fees this General Election. Though
a party divide has seemingly arisen over the matter, the Lib Dem manifesto promises to phase
out tuition fees for students by 2015. Under this radical plan, final year students will be allevi-
ated of their debts first.
“Students want to be treated like grown-ups; they know money doesn’t grow on trees. That’s
why we have agreed together to lay out a financially responsible timetable to scrap fees, step
by step, after the general election,” said Clegg.
