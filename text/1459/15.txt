This one dayer in the heart of London’s
East End should definitely be on your
radar if your looking for a suitable fes-
tival for your indie or electro needs.
This will be the fourth annual event,
and by now the logistical issues that
Field Day
Headlining the main stage is french
synth poppers Phoenix along with
veteran post-punk act The Fall.
Further down the bill is Imperial
Alumnus Caribou who will be sure to
swirl out some fine IDM beats from his
latest album ‘Swim’, and Lightspeed
Champion will also feature.
Electro-heads will be probably be
drawn to Bugged Out’s very own stage
that will feature some fine glitches,
pulses and warbles from acts like
Simian Mobile Disco, Fake Blood,
and Chilly Gonzales.
There are three other stages with
notable acts including the lofi noise
of No Age, the looping acoustic
samples of Atlas Sound, and probably
something a bit mental from These
New Puritains who cite the smurfs as
one of their influences.
Frank Turner surprises me. His re-
corded work is remarkably unre-
markable, a kind of folk-rock, singer-
songwriter mash-up that leaves a lot
to be desired. Yet despite this, and the
fact I did not know a single one of his
songs prior to the show, Frank Turner
quite simply blew me away.
Maybe it was the passion with
which Turner performed – the

clouded over the festivals debut should
be completely ironed out. Aside from
the music, the festival aims to have
some sort of village fete vibe offering
‘rural fayre,’ which is all very quaint
although one can hope that it won’t
smell of manure. It’s reasonably priced
at £33.33, which I guess is also nice if
you’ve got a fetish for thirds.
Hyde Park plays host to this three day
festival on the 2nd-4th July, and boasts
an eclectic mix of new and established
acts. There is only one stage however,
so some lineup scrutiny might be re-
quired, although there are beer gar-
dens and chill out areas to compliment
the music.
Wireless Festival
Friday is a wholey poppy affair, head-
lined by Pink and other acts including
the Ting Tings, The Gossip and Plan
B.
Saturday is a traditionally more
dance orientated day; this year it is
headlined by LCD Soundsystem with
2manydj’s, DJ Shadow, UNKLE and
Missy Elliott also featuring. Snoop
Dogg is also listed as a special guest.
Sunday has the epic Jay Z along with
Lily Allen, Friendly Fires and Guitar
legend mophead Slash. There is a bit
of variation with Chase and Status,
Chipmunk and Mr Hudson so per-
haps this is the most eclectic day.

themes of his songs remind me of Os-
car Wilde, focused on ideas of enjoying
life to the fullest (‘Yes I’m definitely go-
ing to hell, but I’ll have all the best sto-
ries to tell’), and come from the heart.
Maybe it was the crowd’s response to
his songs – the fans knew every word
off by heart; the audience jumped,
pumped their fists, and even moshed
the evening away.
But, for me the most fascinating
thing about ‘the real Frank Turner’ is
how easy it is to relate to him. Whether
it be Frank asking his good friend Dan
to accompany him on stage while he
sang a song written about the guy, or
to tell us the story behind the song
Bombay Bicycle Club
The principle of ‘Survival of The Fittest’ holds as true for indie
music as it does for the natural world. While weaker indie-pop
bands have crumbled beneath the weight of their own medi-
ocrity, Bombay Bicycle Club have rightfully emerged from the
NME indie hype-fest as a band with real talent and more than
a few fantastic songs. Are they pioneering? No. Are they great
to listen to? Definitely. - Kadhim Shubber
Live Review:
Frank Turner
★★★★★
‘Long Live the Queen’, about a friend
who died and told him (as the cho-
rus goes) ‘You’ll live to dance another
day, it’s just now you have to dance
for the two of us’ we warm to Turner
for his obvious love for his friends,
and we sing along with his lyrics for
their obvious love of life. Some artists
are interested in turning themselves
into stars. Turner on the other hand
scoffs at this behaviour, and is all the
more charming because of it. As his
lyrics go ‘there’s no such thing as rock
stars, there’s just people who play
music, and some of them are just like
us, and some of them are dicks’.
- Mariam Zahedi
They’re
apparently
releasing an
acoustic album
in July (eek)
and promoting
it with a series
of gigs in
churches. Until
then they’re
busy selling
out The Forum,
but I won’t be
satisfied until
they give out
complementary
curries at their
shows.

Close to 3 years after the release of his
last album ‘Release the stars’, Rufus
Wainwright returns to his solo piano-
playing roots with ‘Songs for Lulu’.
The album serves as a tribute to his
late mother, folk singer Kate McGar-
rigle and the time alone with his piano
was considered a way of coping with
his mother’s imminent death. Al-
though a biased super-fan of Rufus,
this album is sublime. It screams of
the melancholy drama of his recent
French opera, however it manages to
maintain its emotional and personal
element with references to his part-
ner Jorn and his sister Martha. This
is unlike anything he has produced
before and really showcases his lyri-
cal talent as well as his piano playing
ability. Favourite song on the album:
The Dream. - Emily Beech
