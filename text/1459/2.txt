dB’s: You’ve had the last dance
The Union’s much-maligned night-
club, dBs, played out its final tunes at
the Easter Carnival on the last day of
Spring term.
dBs, now undergoing a major res-
toration project which will see it re-
named Metric, was host to T4’s Jamee-
la Jamil and Emma Harkness as the
students said their goodbyes to a ven-
ue that has served them for 12 years.
There was a loud roar of approval as
Dizzee Rascal’s Bonkers was played as
dBs’ final song.
It was business as usual despite the
occasion on the Union’s traditional
end-of-term party. It was poignant
that the club operated at near to full
capacity for most of the night; it has
come up against much criticism by
students in its lifetime and has seen
many a DJ perform to a sparse and
stolid crowd over the years.
As part of the Union’s Phase 3 project
that cost them £2.4million, renovation
of the venue started almost immedi-
ately after the Easter Carnival. da Vin-
ci’s bar will now only be available for
use until the end of the summer term.
Beyond that, temporary replacement
bars outside and in Activity Space 1
will open for the summer period.
Visitors to Beit Quad will see the
entrances to dBs boarded up, and in
its current state, all furnishings have
been removed and the walls and ceil-
ing have been stripped down. The
prominent structure left is a pillar
positioned directly in front of the pro-
posed position of the new stage. The
pillar has been the subject of much
debate over the past few months;
Union officials deliberated whether
or not to take on the costly removal
of the potentially stage-obstructing
beam. Being weight-bearing, the pro-
cedure is risky and hence dBs was
closed off earlier than normal to take
this into account. The foot-wide beam
is now due to be extracted from the
building structure.
An entirely revamped ground floor
is expected to be in full flow for Fresh-
ers’ Week 2010.
G
reece formally asked for a bailout from the EU and the IMF
last Friday. EU ministers, both before and after the an-
nouncement by Greek president Karolos Papoulias, have
stated that the EU would potentially be willing to lend 30
billion Euros to Greece at an interest rate of 5% per year.
Greek ten-year government bonds are currently trading at over 11% on
the news of an S&P downgrade to junk status on Wednesday. Greek
two-year bonds had a yield of 38% on Wednesday. The IMF is reportedly
willing to lend Greece a further 15 billion Euros at what would probably
be a lower rate than the EU loan. Adding to doubts over the success of
the package is speculation by analysts of whether 45 billion Euros will be
enough to fix Greece’s problems. German support, where 57% of the pop-
ulation is against a Greek bailout, is crucial for the success of the package.
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the IMF, was set to meet with German
chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin this week to discuss possible options
at the time of writing.
The world beyond
College walls

U
krainian lawmakers en-
gaged in a sports day
of sorts in their parlia-
mentary chamber on
Tuesday.
Activities included egg throwing,
boxing, smoke bomb dispersal, and
tug-of-war. Members of parliament
filled the chamber’s voting machines
with glue. The speaker oversaw the
festivities from beneath umbrellas
held by his aides in order to protect from themselves from aerial attack.
Members of the public engaged in demonstrations outside parliament
but the intensity did not reach the levels found inside. The cause for
concern was a deal to extend Russia’s lease of the Sevastopol naval base.
Sevastopol has hosted the Russian military since 1778, was under siege
by the allies during the Crimean War, and is still the home of Russia’s
Black Sea fleet. Ukraine and Russia reached a deal to extend the lease
for twenty-five years in return for discounted gas supplies from Russia.
Relations between the two countries have improved drastically since the
election of a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, last month. The
parliament ultimately approved the agreement with a small majority.

C
hina reformed its laws regarding leaks of state secrets, espe-
cially on the Internet, this week. The reform was prompted
by last year’s conviction of four employees of Rio Tinto, a
mining conglomerate, on charges of bribery and stealing
state commercial secrets.
That trial had created much concern in the international business com-
mittee because the twenty-year old existing laws on the subject were
vague about what information constituted state secrets, especially with
regards to commercial activity. The government moved to clarify what
commercial information could be considered a state secret. The new law
also places new responsibilities on communications providers to monitor
their channels for leaks. According to Xinhua, “information transmis-
sions should be immediately stopped if they are found to contain state
secrets.” Privacy advocates are concerned about the measures, though
exactly how they will be implemented is still unclear. Official reports
have not mentioned to what degree communications providers will be
responsible in the monitoring of internet traffic, phone calls, etc. for the
initial detection of leaks.

It’s weird, because dBs above looks in
a better state than before it closed
Ahh, those sweet memories of queuing up for half an hour just for a pint at the world’s tiniest bar
