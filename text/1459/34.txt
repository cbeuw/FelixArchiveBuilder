Measuring your heart rate - the Suunto way
Did you know your heart rate can be
used as an accurate way of measuring
your exercise intensity and is an ex-
tremely useful tool in monitoring your
progress to reach your training goals?
There are many types of heart rate
monitoring devices available but here
at Ethos we have the latest up to date
technology, the Suunto Fitness So-
lution. The Suunto Fitness solution
works by simply strapping a belt across
your chest and as you enter the gym or
studio and start exercising an electro-
magnetic signal is sent to the Suunto
POD receiver and your heart rate will
be displayed on the screen or projector.
Once you have got your heart rate
monitor belt it can only be beneficial
to you if you understand the heart rate
readings you get when you are exercis-
ing and also knowing what the limits
are. With the Suunto solution this is all
done for you. The Suunto system cal-
culates your Heart Rate Zones and also
calculates your Training Effect.
Making sure you are exercising in the
correct Heart Rate Zones will improve
your progression at that particular in-
tensity and enable you to achieve max-
imal results. It is also a good way of
keeping you on track and maintaining
motivation to keep up your aerobic ex-
ercise sessions. The different exercises
zones help specify the best Heart Rate
Zones for you to train in and there-
fore enhance your fitness and Training

IC’s 1st XI first game of the season was
away against the University of Reading
2nd XI. The early morning showers
had just about disappeared ready for
an exciting game of cricket. Reading
won the toss and elected to field.
Imperial’s openers Matt Tarr (73)
and James Musgrave (78) attacked the
new ball to bring up a stylish and rapid
century partnership in just 14 overs; a
dream start. Both Tarr and Musgrave
punished any poorly bowled balls with
Tarr hitting three sixes; one of which
landed outside the ground on a nearby
road.
However, poor concentration was to
lead to the downfall of both batsman as
they spooned catches in the off side. A
similar story was to follow for most of
the Imperial batters.
After a couple of quick wickets and
a slight dip in run rate, Ankit Patel
(40) hung around producing a watch-
ful innings, while short cameos at the
other end brought Imperial up to a
good total of 280. Imran Zahid (26) in
particular dispatched several balls out
of the park, including one monster six
down the ground. From 256-5 in 44
overs IC felt that they could have done
better but were happy with the score
nonetheless.
Navin Surtani and Andrew Payne
opened the bowling for Imperial and
once again gave the team a great start
to the innings. Surtani, in particular,
was bowling a perfect line and length
with a brilliant balance of seam and
swing; any opening batsman’s night-
mare. In contrast Payne utilised a
completely different style who, with
his height was able to exploit some of
the demons in the pitch; one delivery
bounced off a length and shaved the
batsman’s head as it raced through to
the keeper.
Pressure was building which ulti-
mately caused the initial wickets, one
each for Surtani (1-16) and Payne (1-
47), courtesy of a well judged caught-
and-bowled. Wonderboy Rehan Ali
got the wicket of the day with a hidden
bouncer that completely deceived the
Reading no. 4.
It looked like Imperial were on the
home stretch at the drinks break with
the score on 70-5 after 25 overs, but
Reading had other ideas. Number 6
(Grindal) and 7 (Waterstone) were
picking off the bad balls after the break,
steadily accumulating runs while Im-
perial kept looking for the next wicket.
Joe O’Gorman used the pitch to his
advantage with some leg-spin, but the
odd loose ball kept the runs ticking
over. Eventually O’Gorman snuck one
through and bowled Waterstone to get
the 6th wicket.
Grindal kept going though, now
starting to accelerate with several
mammoth sixes and a punishing at-
titude to anything slightly off line or
length, working his way to a century.
Steady wickets at the other end kept
the pressure on, but you could sense
the game had become close with on-
field tension increasing every over.
Pressure on the fielders led to a couple
of difficult chances going down and
some misfields on the boundary.
Ehtasham Junaid bowled well from
one end to keep it tight, but at the oth-
er end Patel kept leaking runs.
Umpires began questioning the
over-rate and with Imperial were rush-
ing through their overs, the score at
268-9 after 48 overs and Grindal was
on strike: 13 runs required from 12
balls. The first ball of the 48th over was
short; Grindal went for the pull, look-
ing for the gap at the deep square leg

Imperial lost by 8 wickets
Imperial cricketers begin their season with two promising performances
Effect.
Zone 60 – 70% helps develop basic
endurance and aerobic capacity. It can
also help you lose weight by fat burn-
ing which is when your fat provides
some of the total energy you need to
keep going. This is most beneficial
when exercising for a duration of 40
minutes plus. The longer you exercise
at this intensity the more fat you will
use up for energy. If the intensity of ex-
ercise is increased then the fat contri-
bution will decrease.
Zone 70 – 80% will help develop
your cardiovascular system. This is
the body’s ability to transport oxygen
to the working muscles and transport
carbon dioxide away from the working
muscles. As you get fitter you will im-
prove your aerobic capacity.
Zone 80 – 90% will help to develop
your lactic acid system and find out
your anaerobic threshold. During this
zone the amount of fat being used as
energy is greatly reduced and the gly-
cogen stored in your muscles is used.
One of the waste products of burning
glycogen is lactic acid which builds up
in the working muscles.
Your anaerobic threshold is the point
where your body cannot remove lac-
tic acid from the working muscles
quickly enough. There is only a cer-
tain amount of lactic acid, which the
muscles can tolerate before fatigue and
soreness sets in and the exercise must
be stopped. You can delay the onset of
fatigue through correct training of the
lactic acid system and you may be able
to increase your tolerance to lactic acid
build-up.
Zone 90 – 100% is only possible for
short periods of time and can help to
develop speed by training your fast
twitch muscle fibres.
Only the very fit are able to train
effectively within this zone. It is rec-
ommended you seek advice about the
correct way to train in this zone due
to the risks associated with high heart
rates.
When you are complete your work-
out and you take your belt off, the sys-
tem creates a summery of your work-
out including energy consumption and
your Training effect results.
Making sure you are achieving the
correct Training Effect will improve
your progression and help you achieve
your exercise goals. It will help keep
you on track and maintain your moti-
vation during exercise sessions. This is
all done using the Suunto Fitness So-
lution so you no longer have to worry
about whether your are doing enough
in your training sessions and if your
current exercise sessions have actually
been making a difference to you. You
should also now have an idea of what
intensity you should be training at for
certain results.

boundary, but instead he top edged it
straight back to the bowler, handing
Imperial a tense victory.
The players, although shocked at
how close the game had become,
showed fantastic sportsmanlike beah-
viour in commiserated Grindal (132)
on his brilliant innings.
The team knew that the game should
never have been allowed to get as close
as it did and that improvements are
required throughout the forthcoming
season.

After an unusually prompt meet by a
scratched together 2nd XI, everyone
set out for a ‘home’ game at Harling-
ton. However, after deciding that the
team was lacking a bit of communal
spirit, captaincy debutant Pete Swal-
low decided to take the scenic route in
and around Heathrow (not helped by
being told to get the wrong bus).
Fortunately everyone arrived on
time and a new team spirit had been
formed by gently abusing the Captain.
Brighton won the toss and decided
they would field first giving most of
the team time to sit down and chill
out. The makeshift opening pair of
Sandeep Saha and new-boy Alex Tin-
dale (40) started slowly and Sandeep
was soon out.
The second new player Raj S and
Alex then developed a good partner-
ship and runs started to flow until a
horrendous mix-up lead to Raj be-
ing run out. Wickets then were lost at
regular intervals until Rohan Babla and
Ahsen Khan (20) came in and, to the
surprise of everyone, took the attack
to the rather pathetic spinner put on
to bowl with Rohan (33), who’d prob-
ably not hit a ball in any of the training
sessions, hitting two rather impressive
6s that he will not forget (and won’t let
anyone who talks to him forget either).
Imperial ended up on 147 all out.
Buoyed by a good finish to their
innings, IC set out to field with
confidence.
Pete decided to take responsibility
and started off with a fast and hostile
opening over, taking a wicket with the
3rd ball; guided to an expertly placed
Alex in the slips. Rajiv Bhar, the other
opening bowler, was unlucky to not
get a wicket as he had several chances
dropped, something that plagued the
team and was ultimately responsible
for the loss as Brighton managed to
get the 148 required for the loss of only
one more wicket.
Overall, the team performance was
good within which there was a lot of
enthusiasm and effort while many
positives can be taken from the game
as we look to improve over the forth-
coming season.
Final congratulations to Alex Tindale
for his man of the match perform-
ance for scoring 40 runs and taking 2
catches.
