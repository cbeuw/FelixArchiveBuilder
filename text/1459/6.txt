GENERAL ELECTION
WHO SHOULD YOU BE VOTING FOR?
AS THE GENERAL ELECTION APPROACHES, FELIX OUTLINES HOW THE PARTIES PLAN TO MAKE LIFE
EASIER, OR INDEED MORE DIFFICULT, FOR AN IMPERIAL STUDENT IN THE COMING YEARS. BY DAN WAN
T
he manifesto launches from the three main par-
ties, Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats,
yielded some good news for all with an occupa-
tional interest in science. Unlike the two previous
elections in ’01 and ’05, Labour and the Conservatives have
pushed scientific policies onto the forefront by featuring
them in a section, albeit limited, of their 2010 manifestos.
The UK’s scientific industries certainly stake a claim that
much more attention should be paid to policies directly af-
fecting them. Businesses using elements of physics alone
contribute 6.4% of the UK’s national economic output; this is
as much as the finance, banking and insurance sectors com-
bined. This figure doesn’t include the business sector based
on biological, medical, engineering or chemical principles
either. In stark comparison, one only has to look how much
public debate arises when the financial services sector is un-
der scrutiny. To take it from another angle, The Campaign for
Science and Engineering (CaSE) claims that there are about
three million people in the UK with a scientific background,
or 7% of the electorate; that’s more than enough to win or lose
such a tight election as this.
To put it simply, the better corporate science and engineer-
ing is allowed to perform by the Government, the more jobs
available to those qualified, i.e. students graduating from in-
stitutions like Imperial.
CaSE have lobbied the importance of science and its related
disciplines to the leading political parties in the run up to the
General Election, and even wrote to the leaders of the three
main parties asking them to set out their policies on science.
Dr. Hilary Leevers, Assistant Director of CaSE told felix that
“CaSE and others have worked to show that there is a science
vote to be won.
“The need for the parties to respond to the coherent de-
mands of scientists and engineers has ensured that all the
main party manifestos covered these areas, and they even
form the basis of the newly born Science Party.”
Dr. Leevers stressed the fact there was a very important de-
cision to be made by scientists and engineers.
“Many felix readers will want to know how the different
parties intend to support education in science, engineering,
technology and mathematics, and the careers in the academic
and private sector that follow on from it.
It is up to voters to decide how they take this information
into account; they may choose to vote for the party they be-
lieve has the best policies or the candidate they believe will
work the hardest for science and engineering.
Help decide who will be working on policies affecting sci-
ence and engineering in the next Parliament.”

A
cademically, the British
institutions’ research
output comfortably
sits in the ‘world -class’
bracket. However, there
are growing fears that without the
right investment into academic sci-
ence from the next Government,
the UK are at risk of falling behind
international competition.
Earmarked as the next interna-
tional powerhouse, China’s spend-
ing on research funding has in-
creased 20% every year since 1999,
and has overtaken the UK’s equiva-
lent spending. South Korea’s “U-
Korea” programme has seen a surge
in funding in the nanotechnology
industry, and overall spending on
private and public research that ex-
ceeds £35 billion. The USA already
produces globally-leading research,
but President Barack Obama last
year pledged a multi-billion stimu-
lus package into science research
funding, hoping to achieve levels
of scientific output “at the height of
the space race” in the 1960s.
Needless to say, the way the UK’s
academic output rises or falls in the
coming years, the currently prestig-
ious reputation of Imperial College,
as a specialist institute for science,
engineering, technology and medi-
cine, will follow suit.
The overall budget for science and
its associated research fields is set
out the Government and divided up
between the UK’s seven Research
Councils according to their relative
size and importance. With their
portion of the overall budget, each
council then goes about setting a
generaldirectionofresearchintheir
respective field. This is done by allo-
cating funding to projects proposed
to them by research groups and de-
partments from universities across
the UK. Imperial College, as an insti-
tution, has a strong standing in the
British scientific community, but
access to funding is likely to follow
any national trends when budget
cuts are concerned.
Effectively, the larger the cuts a
new Government makes to overall
science and research budgets, the
less PhD opportunities there will be
for those looking for postgraduate
study in science.
Academically speaking...
CaSE’s invitation to elaborate
their science spokespeople more of a
chance to release a more detailed and
specialised manifesto for anyone who
cares to read. Gordon Brown is the lat-
est of the three to respond, but detailed
analysis of the situation was accompa-
nied with an impressive specialised
Science Manifesto.
David Cameron’s response expands
on his manifesto pledges and veers
towards a much wider vision of ad-
vancement in British science and as-
sociated industries. It is considerably
shorter than Nick Clegg’s response
however. The Lib Dem leader’s re-
turn letter demonstrates an intricate
knowl-
edge of the
workings
behind
both aca-
demic
and cor-
porate
science,
men-
tioning
issues surround-
ing post-doctoral opportunities,
gender imbalances in the industry and
the importance of peer-, and not gov-
ernmental, review.

I
f it hadn’t quite clicked already,
this General Election is important;
notjustforthecountryasawhole,
but for you too. As Imperial stu-
dents, under- or postgraduate,
you are the next generation of scientists,
engineers, doctors and businessmen of
the UK (if not the world). Graduating
from a ‘world-class’ university certainly
sets your bar high for career aspirations,
and the fields of academia or business
you’ll be leading will either suffer or
prosper under the new Government to
be formed on May 7th.
Hence, this General Election may have
a significant bearing on all Imperial stu-
dents graduating in the coming years.
As much as you protest, your days as
a student will come to an end. Finding
yourself knee-deep in the mire that is the
job market may come as a shock to the
system, but at least this General Election
will allow you to have some say in how
painful or delightful this shock may be.
Moving away from a generic compari-
son of the three main parties’ manifesto
pledges, felix is looking into the policies
and issues being discussed that will di-
rectly affect a fledgling workforce enter-
ing the industries of science (academic
or otherwise) and City business. felix will

he Campaign for Science and
Engineering (CaSE) is a lead-
ing political advocate for sci-
ence and engineering in the
UK. Director Nick Dusic and Chair
Professor Hugh Griffiths formally sent
a letter to Gordon Brown, David Cam-
eron and Nick Clegg requesting they
clearly and comprehensively outlined
their parties’ proposed policies regard-
ing science, technology and engineer-
ing. The letter, also printed in The
Times, can be seen online on CaSe’s

Despite over half of students
intending to vote Lib Dem, the
overwhelming majority predict
a Conservative win or a hung
parliament. This echoes the recent
YouGov poll that showed 49% of
people would vote Lib Dem if they
realistically thought Nick Clegg’s
party could actually take power.
