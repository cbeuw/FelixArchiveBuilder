BUCS win for Imperial’s
amazing marathon man
L
ast Sunday’s London Mara-
thon was the scene of a very
impressive performance
by Imperial second-year
mathematician Alex Milne,
who won the BUCS marathon cham-
pionships. Finishing 160th overall in
the race with a speedy time of 2:39:26,
20-year-old, Alex was the fastest
BUCS-registered runner to complete
the 26 miles.
felixSport caught up with him to find
out more about his success, and what
goes into running a marathon.
It turns out that last week’s success
stemmed from a tragic accident three
years ago: “In 2007 a good friend of
mine broke his neck on a trampoline
and since then has been paralyzed
from the neck down. I wanted to help
Jack out and decided that running the
marathon for him would be a great way
to do so. I began training later that year
with just a few runs here and there. I
got a place in the 2008 London Mara-
thon through the Spinal Injuries As-
sociation and managed to raise £4000
for them and £6000 for my friend Jack.
The run was lots of fun and I was one
of the youngest runners (18 was the
minimum age). I finished in an OK 3
hours 30 minutes.”
This initial performance encouraged
Alex to take running more seriously
and join a club. He gradually built
up to the 2009 marathon, winning a
place through the ballot and aiming
for a sub-three-hour time. He finished
in a “very disappointing” 3 hours 22
minutes.
This year’s marathon, then, was a
chance for improvement. “After run-
ning really badly in the London Mara-
thon last year, I wanted to do it prop-
erly this time. This meant training
harder and I have currently run every
single day since 22nd
May 2009.”
“I’ve run over a thousand miles since
the beginning of 2010 and my highest
mileage week (102) was 4 weeks be-
fore the marathon. The most impor-
tant part of my training was the long
run, which I gradually increased until
running the furthest of 24 miles. The
runs around Hyde Park with the Cross
Country Club on Wednesday are the
most fun as they are with a big group.”
Such grueling training could only
pay off: “I was feeling really good up
until 18 miles. I had stuck to the pace I
wanted and the noise from the crowds
was incredible.” But a marathon is
never plain sailing, and Alex had to dig
very deep into his physical and men-
tal resources to keep going during the
race: “My legs started to feel heavier
and the proper pain started at mile 20.
It got worse and worse, but I forced
myself not to stop. By the 26th
mile I
was completely disorientated and felt
on the verge of passing out. Luckily I
made it over the finish line still stand-
ing and then collapsed!”
It was done, though. After a year’s
hard training, he had crossed the finish
line – although realizing what he had
done took a while to sink in as he re-
covered from his effort in the first aid
tent. He is, however, delighted with the
result : “ I wanted to run under 2 hours
45 minutes, so I was very happy with
2:39:26”.
Happy he should be, as that time
meant he came 160th overall (out of
over 36 000 participants) and first in
the BUCS championships. This sur-
prised even him, though: “I had actu-
ally forgotten that I entered the BUCS
Marathon Championships, so it was
only on the evening after the race that
I looked up the times of the other guys
and found out I had won! I also saw
that one of the others who finished just
behind me had been 4 minutes ahead
at halfway. This made all the pain
worth it.”
Another taste of success, then, to cap
off what has been a rewarding year, as

Alex also won the Herts Cross Coun-
try Championships and the London
Colleges Cross Country League, and
came second in the Berkhamsted half
marathon.
However, when asked about running
future marathons, he remains unsure.
“That’s a tough question. I have now
qualified for a championship place so
it’s tempting. However, I might give it a
rest for a few years to focus on 5km to
half marathon. My next main goal is to
run a half marathon in under 70 min-
utes, as that would be getting me closer
to the elite times.”
Finally, does he have any tips for
those of us who want to try running a
marathon for ourselves?
“I think everyone should run a mara-
thon at least once in their lives. It is a
unique challenge and if you want to
test yourself this is the way to do it. In
terms of training, the most important
thing is getting in some runs of at least
20 miles at a fairly easy pace. It may
sound like lots, but it will go by quickly
and you (but not your legs) will feel
great afterwards. In the race, the one
thing you should not do is go out too
fast. It’s easy to get excited and forget
you still have a hell of a long way to go.”
In any case, Alex showed a lot of grit
in this year’s run, and his words are
something to ponder for the would-be
marathoner. Maybe future years will
bring more Imperial participants in the
testing ordeal!
Alex would like to thank the Cross
Country and Athletics Club for the
great training sessions, and his girl-
friend, Jessica Floyd, for supporting
him all the way.
