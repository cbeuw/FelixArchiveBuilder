eyes as I walked past rails and rails of
clothes. There was no Mark Fast! What
a con!
Then a helpful shop assistant came
to my rescue. It turned out that Mark
Fast’s garments have just arrived ear-
lier that morning, and they remained
in the back, unboxed.
I described my dream skirt. Miracu-
lously, the man agreed to go to the back
and do a quick ransack for me!
Although the skirt was non-existent,
a dress variation was available for pur-
chase. I gingerly took the dress in my
arms, petting it. My imagination had
perfected the dress in so many dimen-
sions... I was looking for a silky and
soft texture. The reality was more of
a rough, strawy sensation. I was still
electrified, nonetheless.
The size 0 phenomenon hit home
in the fitting room. I can barely fit my
thighs into the dress. The dress was so
tiny that I wonder how many women
in real life can manoeuvre into it with
ease and grace?
The Erdem rail was disappointing
too. But I was assured by the staff that
the designers send in new stock every
week, that I should keep coming back.
Shame I live about 100 miles away.
As I left the shop disappointed, the
credit card breathed a sigh of relief. It
has survived another battle.
Rid of the stress pimples
N
o one likes facial indi-
cators, especially when
they are stress induced
and flare in a raffish
crimson colour plus the
formidable pus.
Many assail these unsightly spots
with an antediluvian regime – anti-
blemish face wash, scrubs, benzoyl
peroxide creams, toothpaste...
I have experienced the cherry blos-
som before and I know that having
acne can feel like a debilitating dis-
ease. Fortunately, I have found a re-
gime that works for me. So if you are a
step short of applying sulphuric acid,
read on.
It is common knowledge that acne
is caused by blocked pores. This is
caused by the a toxic cocktail of se-
bum and dead cells. The most com-
mon home treatment is to engage
with a harsh cleansing soap, as well as
abstaining from moisturisers.
Bust exam stress in style

Hello and welcome! After a brief
hiatus, we are back, charged with
ammunition.
During the Easter Holiday, our new
Fashion and Beauty Editor, Saskia
Verhagen, and Charlotte Morris have
discussed our way forward as a fash-
ion team. In the future, there will be a
regular beauty column, as well as excit-
ing features that will no doubt be very
engaging!
So, if you have any ideas or feedback
for us, feel free to write to us at the
email address above.
I also went to Bicester Village, the
heaven for the high fashion cheap-
skates during the holiday.
I went there on the opening day of
the British Fashion Council’s pop-up
store. The shop is inconspicous com-
pared to the big bad signs of Dolce &
Gabbana and Burberry alike. Blink and
you’ll miss it!
As I stepped into the shop, I could
feel my credit card twitching in my
purse. BFC has promised 50% reduc-
tions on almost all merchandise from
Mark Fast, Erdem, Jean-Pierre Bragan-
za and many more.
I had my eyes fixed on the Mark Fast
skirt that I moaned about a few edito-
rials back. An embroidered piece from
Erdem was worth an investment too.
Mark Fast, Mark Fast... I squinted my
Time-out
A couple of hours of doing something
you fancy isn’t going to make or break
your exam result.
Boost your energy by taking a short
stroll, doing a few stretches or taking
a 15 minutes power nap.
Elena de Cortes, masseuse and aro-
matherapist, offers discounts for Im-
perial students at her practice at the
Imperial College Health Centre. A lit-
tle massage does wonders! Refreshed
and motivated , you are ready to start
work with more energy than before.
Dressing
Comfort, comfort, comfort.
Luckily enough, comfort is one of
the dominant themes this season.
Thanks goes out to Alexander Wang,
who has made jersey trousers and high
school hoodies forgivable for this very
summer.
For me, comfort means plenty of
loose-fitting cotton jersey; lots of lay-
ers which can be removed or replaced
as appropriate for the Saharan climes
of the 5th floor or the late-night cold,
blustery winds on your walk home.
Hydration
All-important – coffee or Red Bull is
fine for when you need that quick extra
boost, but water is generally what you
need to avoid revision-induced head-
aches and lethargy.
While we’re on the topic, use caf-
feine wisely. The chemical can provide
a surge of energy and concentration,
but like any drugs it can also give you
a comedown. So either continually use
the stimulant to sustain that energy
level or...
Drink plenty of water!
But the myth is true: the more hy-
drated your skin is, the less your skin
produces natural grease to prevent
water loss.
Adopt a mild cleansing routine.
Strangely enough, a mild water-based
hand moisturiser works best.
Work a dollop of the moisturiser -
plus a dash of water - on your face as
you normally would with a face wash.
The dirt is dissolved in the hydropho-
bic part of the moisturiser. Then, rinse
until the skin feels fresh. Blot dry with
a clean hand towel.
Using this method, the taut skin af-
ter a wash is replaced with a supple
and comfortable feeling. Try Vase-
line’s Aloe Vera Intensive Care Body
Lotion.
The skincare sequence is normally
wash, tone and moisturise. If you have
breakouts, skip toner altogether. As
toners are not wiped away after appli-
cation, the tiniest stimulant can result
in angry eruptions. This is because
toners usually contain alcohol – the
primary stimulant in cosmetics and
skincare products.
Finally, moisturising is not to be
skipped. This helps to manage the
excess secretion of sebum. The epit-
ome of a good moisturiser is one that
leaves no ‘sticky residue’.
Any greasy or plasticky trail that is
left on your skin will clog pores. Gar-
nier’s Daily Regenerating Moisturiser
is a soft water-based moisturiser that
contains essential elements for your
skin.
Its formula is simple and leaves your
skin looking mattified and clear.
If you’re willing to push the boat
out, Chanel’s Hydramax+ Active Se-
rum gives you all the moisture you
need for the day.
If you have access to an aloe vera
plant, apply a thin layer of its jelly
content as a face mask. Leave it on for
15 minutes.
Aloe vera has remarkable hydrating
complexes that will leave your skin
immediately hydrated and refreshed.
Rinse off the excess residue with wa-
ter and dry with hand towel.

Snacking
Choose energy-rich foods – fresh
or dried fruit is just as good as a
chocolate hobnob (guilty) but much
healthier.
Also, the ridiculous library thermo-
stat plus excessive chocolate intake
leads to inevitable spotty study-leave
skin.
Head to Snog the Frozen Yoghurt
shop near South Kensington station.
The friendly millieu and the revitalis-
ing frozen yoghurt plus fresh fruits
will give you an instant energy boost.
Exams are here and stress is riding high. Here
are Saskia Verhagen ‘s ways to de-stress.
Stay active
Even though time is scarce and many
feel compelled to revise instead of
sleep, the building up of excess stress
can reduce your mental flexibility.
Rid of those stiff shoulder muscles by
doing simple stretches at home. If pos-
sible, find 15-20 minutes a day to do a
quick run, a few sit-ups etc.
Once you sweat it all out, you’ll feel
infinitely better. Refreshed and ener-
gised, you can go for miles longer!
Besides, the serotonin keeps your
spirits up. After all, revision can be long
and tedious.
