ABOMINABLE (adj.)
Describes a situation (or a catalyst
thereof) that is as bad as having
an armed explosive device in the
stomach of a live male bovine.
Originates in a village newspaper
article documenting an occurance
of this very event in a local farmer’s
field, though there is no evidence of
main media interest to corroborate
this story. No one died. Except
the bull and an old woman in a
wheelchair who was going to die
soon anyway so neither counts.
If you have a word whose origin you’re
interested in, send your request to us
at sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

efore I go off into my weekly
rant I have to state that the
censorship still rages here
at felix. Twats. Oh yeah, and
hello, hope you had a good break. Now
we’re done with all the pleasantries,
lets get down to business. For most of
us this business will be sitting hunched
over a book desperately trying to re-
vise, or more often than not, learn the
endless prose that your lectures con-
tinually interrupted your sleep with.
Unless of course you happen to be
in the library, then you’ll probably be
sweating like a paedophile in Moth-
ercare. Can they really not cool that
place down?
Back to the point. Once you’ve con-
ducted this Captain Scott standard
epic into the world of nanoconductors,
people still feel the need to wish you
good luck. This gets on my tits. Well,
if I had any it would, and the likelihood
of that happening is ever increasing. In
a deep, heavily scientifically based con-
version with a certain Mr. Philpott on
the subject of oestrogen, he managed
to use all his four years of Imperial Col-
lege tuition to pronounce the fact that
oestrogen “gives you women stuff, like
tits.” Your parents will be proud.
I digress. The phrase ‘good luck’,
whilst having the best intentions of the
recipient in mind is basically bullshit.
What does it even mean? Really have a
think about it, because as you go off to
your exam, luck isn’t going to change
the paper, luck isn’t going to make you
remember that vital equation, luck is
going to do f*ck all to be honest. This
world we find ourselves in is not about
luck. True they say ‘you make your
own luck’, but that’s made by hard
work. They also say ‘shit happens’. If
come your next exam you find your-
self forced to check the front cover of
the paper to check you are in the right
exam because it’s going that badly, ‘shit
happens’. If you’ve done all the revision
you can, then well, it wasn’t meant to
be; ‘shit happens’. Don’t get hung up on
it. Have a pint, listen to Cat Stevens,
whatever floats your boat.
‘Good luck’ is bollocks. It’s become
and instant reply to the word ‘exam’. If
you’re just trying to be nice, just offer
out jelly beans or a coffee. Everyone
loves jelly beans. And if you’ve pissed
about the whole year, well son, you are
a prize tosser and... Good luck.
Wordpath 1,459
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARDS
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WORDS -> SWORD
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 5 letter
word from any 6+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. WORDS-> CROSS (via CROSSWORDS)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORDS -> WARDS (by LS) -> WARES (by LS)
would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.

Winner of last issue
was Team Dirty
Medics. Well done,
keep those answers
coming in.
We have a five letter
puzzle this week.
Thisnewsectionproveditselftobevery
popular. Our inbox was overwhelmed
with etymology requests. With a large
number of readers coincidentally all
suggesting I should research the word
‘dictionary’. I felt the term was too
obscure however and so will not be
including it. However its definition
makes it a perfect candidate name
for the book of word meanings that,
as I mentioned last week, we’ve been
compiling in order to make us enough
monies to escape the felix office.
[We didn’t realise, when we decided to
take on this abominable job (we love
it really), just how hard it’d be to make
monies by selling our newspaper at the
competitive price of 0 penny.]
So we’ve added it to the list, where
it joins ‘The felix Book of Words and
Their Associated Meanings Presented
in Alphabetical Fashioning’, ‘The Big
Book of the Wordier Words You May
Not Know Yet’, and ‘Words (And What
They Mean)’. At the moment it has the
merit of being the most concise option.
T
ehnical term meaning:
‘word origin/ history’.

How to play:
Fill all the squares with numbers to form a path from 1 to 49, such that the arrow
under each number points to the square containing the number one greater
(except for 49 obviously, which has no arrow, being the end of the path).
Hints:
26 is pointed to by three arrows but only one of them is pointing only at 26, so
this square must be 25. The square immediately right of 4 is only pointing to one
square so can temporarily be labelled ‘A’ and the square it’s pointing to can be
labelled ‘A+1’. Now we no longer consider ‘A+1’ as a destination for other arrows.
