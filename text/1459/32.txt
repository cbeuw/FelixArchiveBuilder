Well done to last week’s winner Sher-
yl. Make sure you get those answers in
as soon as you pick the paper up. To
be honest they needn’t even be correct,
it’s unlikely that I’d notice. Well, back
to revision.

Swallow-scopes: Horoscopes but it’s your birthday...
... and you’re a keen bird-watcher. What were you thinking of? Bloody perves, the lot of you. Read on, then....
Cancer
You wake up and
you’ve got several
cigars and a fat chick
next to you. You check
if she’s naked. She’s
not. Phew. You check
if you’re naked. You are. You roll over to find
a small ambiguous farm animal in bed too. It’s
dressed in your clothes. At least it partially is. It
looks kinda silly in your skinny jeans, it does.
Virgo
So.............it’s a
nice day isn’t it?
......... Yeeeeeh........
my weekend was
fine........ going on
holiday soon....hope
the weather’s going to be better there.. Bloody
Britain, eh? With their terrible weather...........
layers, gotta wrap up in layers here in the
UK....... Ohhh! This is my floor, BYE.
Gemini
Sadly your love life is
up the shitter. You’ve
woken up with your
own jizz on your face.
You’ve gotta see some-
one about that whole
sleep-auto-oral pleasure thing. But at least now the
weather’s picking up and you can try telling people
its sun cream when you finally leave your dingy
room, that is.
Pisces
Something is
hurting down there,
but you can’t figure
it out. It’s been
painful ever since
you finished that
internship with UBS. You wake up one night
to find a cucumber slowly excavating itself
out your body. Them banker types are weird,
ain’t they? I WANNA BE THEM!
Leo
You’ve been poking
around on the FOIL
group on Facebook.
The creator is all
‘ironic’ and stuff, but
then you realise he’s
just a sad little boy crying out for attention, and
inordinate amounts of pussy. You can hear his
cries from the other side of Marble Arch.
You feel sympathy for him, but then all those
FOILs are true, aren’t they?
Aries
You know it’s a bad
night when you’ve
had to come out to
your parents and in
the same night they
catch you dressing up
your blow-up sex doll in a kimono. I mean, Asian
boys don’t even wear kimonos, it’s women’s attire.
You’re a confused little boy, my son. Now GET
THE FUCK OUT MY HOUSE.
Scorpio
Imperial Fitfinder? Isn’t
that just the most dis-
placed social network
utilty, like...ever? It’s ba-
sically a website where
mentally-disabled
people try and believe their outlook on life isn’t
mentally-disabled. The evidence shows otherwise.
Busty brunette, Sci Fi Library, on the bean bags at
2AM. Gorgeous. You wear your name tag, it says
“BARRY” on it. Weird name for a girl.......Oh.
Libra
LOOK! That is the last
time I tell you. Your
birthday is no excuse
to go dogging for a
night. Firstly, you don’t
have a f*cking car, just
a shitty old Vespa. It’s lights don’t even work,
how are you going to signal for some rumpy-
pumpy? I just used the term ‘rumpy-pumpy’,
didn’t I? Fuck it, let’s go dogging.
Taurus
You’ve just spent your
entire Easter playing
Angry Birds on your
iPhone and you have
finals in two days.
When you heard of
the volcano postponing exams your heart lept
like it did when you had that near fatal heart
attack. It’s exam day and all you’ve done is drawn
bad sketches of exploding birds in response to a
timed essay question.
Capricorn
You decide to go
hitchhiking and you get
picked up. He’s a dirty
lorry driver and anally
rapes you. Turns out
he’s got leprosy too and his penis snaps off inside
you. Well done, at least you’ve got a 100% organic
butt plug now. You sell the idea to Whole Foods
and they fucking love it. £2.99. Pint?
Aquarius
It’s nearly midnight
and you’ve basically
wanked yourself
into a coma. You’re
friends are still doing
their finals and you
can’t wait for them to finish. Turns out all your
friends decided to celebrate without you. Well,
give yourself another half hour and another
two minutes of porn, and you’ll be trapped in
your dirty but boring cycle of comatosed wank.

Sagittarius
I heard all greasy
bastards are Saggitarius,
so here goes. It’s getting
warmer now, and yes,
T-shirts are allowed.
But, for the sake of
mankind, please have a wash, use some deodorant
before you leave your squalid house. Put down the
Gundam figurines, and pick up a can of Lynx. Give
yourself a good spray - pretend it’s Lv. 57 life elixir.
