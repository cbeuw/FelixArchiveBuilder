A big hand to Matthew Colvin who was the winner of not one, but two, yes, two of last issue’s
puzzle thigies. So yeah. How about you do some work... maybe pass your exams... maybe not
get kicked out... maybe not end up a skag head? Just a thought.

How to play:
The numbers at the side represent the size and
order of blocks in each column and row. There
must be at least one space between each block.
Then insert the numbers from the box in the top
left corner into the unshaded cells and proceed
as for a normal ‘Slitherlink’:
All numbered cells must be surrounded by the
corresponding number of edges. The solution
consists of one continuous line. Any cells without
a number can have any number of edges.
See last issue’s solution (right) for more help.

A group of girls are out shopping
together. Within this group there exists
the following relationships:
Great-grandmother, Great-great-aunt,
Grandmother, Grandniece, aunt, and
two of each of sister and daughter.
Each relationship is between two
distinct individuals - i.e. nobody’s their
own grandmother! Furthermore to that
notion, no time-travel is involved!
What’s the smallest number of girls
this group can be composed of? Submit
your answer with a family tree to us,
by email at sudoku.felix@ic.ac.uk.

Bridges 1,459
How to play:
Connect all the
‘islands’ together
by bridges
running in direct
lines, North,
West, East and
South only, with
no more than
two bridges
connecting any
two distinct
islands. Every
island must have
a total number
of bridges from
it equal to the
number on
the island and
bridges must not
cross islands,
one another or
lead to nowhere!
If you would like to design a puzzle and see it
printed in felix but don’t want to do one every
week, just send us your ideas to the usual place -
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk and if we like them
we’ll print them!
Imagine a bridge that is placed over some water.
That water appears to be troubled. Consulting
your CD collection, for reasons unknown, you ask
Simon and Garfunkle their views. They suggest a
bridge over troubled water. And that’s what GLT
bulit. So well done.
D-Piddy suggested getting smashed off your nog-
ging on crystal meth. That would not be a good
idea, but feel free to give it a try.
