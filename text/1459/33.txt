Hangman gets half-way to summing up its official party manifesto
New research shows that ‘Fuck
Our Imperial Lives’ is “whiniest
facebook group ever”
In a paper to be published in the Lan-
cet next week, new research has shown
that the amount of whining, bitching
and moaning on the “Fuck Our Impe-
rial Lives” (FOIL) Facebook group is
300 times the normal amount.
This startling discovery has given
significant weight to critics of the
group who have said that its members
need to “get some fucking perspective.”
Joe Schnitzel, the author of the pa-
per, said, “We accounted for a vari-
ety of different factors, for example we
normalised our results to account for
exam time stress and depression. But
the levels of whining were still well
above normal.”
Common gripes posted on the Fa-
cebook group include moaning about
the number of exams coming up and
one student even complained that they
“Should’ve gone to Kingston.”
“I don’t want to pass judgement on
individuals,” Mr Schnitzel said, “but
they sound like a bunch of pussies.
Well, more than a bunch; more like 829
pussies. That’s a lot of pussy. Mmm.”
In response to the group, Imperial
College’s Health Centre is taking extra
steps to ensure that Imperial students
don’t get too worried or upset during
the exam period. The new measures
are said to include: A weekly trip to
East London, speed-dating events in
the JCR and in extreme cases, encour-
aging students to “man up”, quit their
“jibber-jabber” and “pity the fools”
who didn’t get into university.
S
eeing as we have decided that
all of our options for voting
in the General Election will
most likely end us up with a
completely incapable fool in
charge of the country, not to mention
the fact that voting gives you cancer
(see Daily Mail’s list of things that give
you cancer - it’s been recently updat-
ed), Hangman has decided to run for
election within the Kensington con-
stituency. Unfortunately, although we
applied to join in the with the televised
Leaders’ Debate, we were rejected, with
various different media establishments
citing the problem as the fact one of
our leader’s aides was ginger. He’s ap-
parently desiccate within seconds un-
der the studio lighting. Fair do’s, we
said. We sacked him and still couldn’t
get TV airtime, so we thought we’d like
to some of our best policies here:
Burqa-wearing has had a lot of bad
press recently, what with people try-
ing to get it banned in public places
and civil service jobs etc... We find this
type of discrimination appalling, and
so should you. We intend to tackle this
issue accordingly. I agree with Nick,
when he says we need more policemen
on the streets. Policemen under the
Hangman government will take on the
new role of ‘Ugly Patrol’. Their job will
be to enforce a strict ‘Non-Ugly Policy’,
a law which will be passed as soon as
possible. This will involve the compul-
sory darkened material covering those
who’s facial features are just plain of-
fensive to the rest of the world. All
people with a BMI of 25+ will also be
fined for every calorie they eat and be
required to wear large cardboard boxes
instead of clothes. The boxes typically
found next to households that have re-
cently purchased a new fridge-freezer
unit. We already have support from
various members of the Tory party on
this issue; David Cameron agrees with
this policy, adding ‘When I was on my
gap yaaah there were some terribly ugly
people in Tanzanaaah.” It has also been
reported he “chundered everywhere” in
sight.
Another policy close to our hearts is
the issue of immigration. Our immi-
gration policy is perhaps not as strict
as other parties’, in the sense that we’re
not going to limit the number of peo-
ple who are allowed to move to the
UK to live and work. We’re not going
to impose testing for English language
skills, or a points-based system to allow
only skilled workers to enter the coun-
try. Instead, all immigrants will have
to enter the country via the delightful
city of Hull. Here they can spend some
time with the pregnant chavs, catch a
few STIs and possibly develop a heroin

that David Cameron has met
during this election, which
bringshislifetimetotalupto56
addiction. Their media and TV expo-
sure will be limited to watching Jeremy
Kyle, reading The Sun newspaper, with
the weekly treat of the Eastenders om-
nibus. They can learn from experience
what the UK is really like, and after a
month’s trial period, be given the op-
tion to go back to their war-torn home.
When the Hangman Party comes to
power (we will), we plan to scrap edu-
cational testing such as SATs, GCSEs
and A-levels in favour of the new Wiki-
pedia Proficiency Test. We, as a party,
believe that a Wikipedia knowledge-
based economy will put as top in the
world for inaccuracy and hilarious in-
jokes that moderators have missed.
We hope to reduce the national debt
by re-instating the debt owed by 18
African countries. At the G8 sum-
mit, some idiot didn’t check his crystal
ball for future recessions and foolishly
cancelled all Third World debt. Fuck-
ing billions of quids there. They owe us
£22bn in total, but ample time will be
allowed; we will give them until 23.59
May 7th 2010 to repay their debts. I
know we said we weren’t bothered, but
we kind of need it back now.
We don’t want to become a nation of
ponytail mullet-wearing Greek people
now, do we?
Vote Hangman, because life’s shit
and we want to make it shitter.
