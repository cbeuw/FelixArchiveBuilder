The NUS debate rages on...The Real Story... OpSoc Apologises
Eeferendum?
Dear Owain,
I am writing in support of L.
Grogan's letter in last weeks FELIX
(No. 1018). Whilst on holiday in
Crete last summer, my friend and I
went to visit the Palace of Knossos.
Student rates were advertised and
she, being a member of the NUS,
paid them. However, although I
produced my ICU card, I was
denied this concession.
On the related subject of
affiliation with ULU, the fact that
being a member of ICU does not
allow the use of Senate House
Library is absurd. For people like
myself who do not live in the South
Kensington area, especially those
in Intercolligate halls, it would be
much more convenient to use ULU
facilities.
Perhaps an IC referendum on
ULU and NUS membership is in
order? Imperial College has got to
realise that London, and indeed the
world, is bigger than South
Kensington.
Yours,
N. Denvar

Poor Profile
Dear Owain,
The article on the Christian Union
expedition to Africa was a poor
profile of what really happened.
Sadly, it does not mirror the sense
of love that each of us, having
been on the trip, have for the
Burkinabe people. Being a
Christian for only four months
(Steve and lain - all their lives) I
was 'new' to a lot of what happ-
ened. The Africans who heard the
gospel for the first time were
amazed and many came to Christ,
many ill villagers we prayed for
became well, a lunatic bound in
chain became sane and the
Burkinabe Christians we worked
with were encouraged by our help
and witness.
The full time missionaries in
Burkina Faso were learning the
culture and languages of the
Africans themselves. Even dressing
in Burkinabe clothes and living in
mud huts; so they became as they
were and sensitive to their back-
ground. Burkinabe Christians
worked with Christians from the
West. In fact their teamwork
showed they complemented one
another.
Burkinabe, Tuareg and Nomadic
tribes were very welcome to our
talks with them about Jesus Christ;
how He died for our sins and came
back to life in order that we can
have relationship with God. By
contrast, in campus conveying any
religious belief is difficult.
Christianity offers something very
special for everyone - from the
illiterate Muslim in Burkina to the
student enjoying one's pint in the
Union bar to the intellectual
Communist. Christianity offers a
magnified friendship. Friendship is
important but to grasp that
friendship can be had with one's
Creator is an awesome oppor-
tunity. Given time we'll all settle
down and perhaps - if we're lucky
or not - have children. Hopefully
we might have something more
interesting to tell them than getting
gutted every day at the union or
freaking all the girls/boys out by
savage Imperial Sex drives at the
nightclubs. A case of deja-vu.
All in all there was so much
'wealth' and insight gained on the
trip to Africa. Now I just want to
become involved full time in
missionary work. On reply to a
person I hadn't spoken to in nine
years informing her that I was a
Christian said this:
"I am so glad that at last you
feel as happy as you do - everyone
is entitled to experience God's
amazing love and yet some people
never do"

NUS letter
Dear Felix,
Concerning Michael Ingram's
article 'RCS to vote on NUS' in last
week's FELIX I would like to point
out the following facts:
Recent investigations have given
that it would cost ICU between
£25000 and £30000 to join NUS,
which is significantly less than
assumed earlier, (i.e. the £40000
figure which you quoted). As you
said, we would also save a
significant amount on alcohol and
catering, and, considering the fact
that NUS also offer free legal
advice, we might end up gaining by
joining. As L. Grogan pointed out
in his letter, there are also the
benefits for individual students to
by considered...
There's the classical counter-
argument. It has almost become a
cliche: "...ICU's trend of remaining
apolitical and hostile to affiliation
with any politically active
organisations." But what does
'political' mean? 'Political'
nowadays has almost become a
swearword, and it is associated
with corruption, power abuse...
But 'politicians' actually are
elected or appointed
representatives, who (should) act in
the interests of the people they
represent. Any of our 'Union
Hacks' are politically active. So
please consider this in future when
you refer to ICU 'not being
political'. This is a false statement.
ICU is all about being politically
active.
The meaning of the phrase is
different. ICU does not want to be
ruled by parties, nor does it want to
see factions emerge within its
ranks, which is laudable. We don't
want to confess to any political
ideology. NUS is functioning along
the party system. Unfortunately.
However there are many other
College Unions around the country
who want to remain politically
unaligned. The most important
faction within NUS is the faction of
the 'independents'. This alliance of
politically unaligned people was
formed with the aim of taking the
power from the parties, and they
succeeded.
I don't think it would be a
betrayal of Imperial College Union
ideals to rejoin NUS. The only
thing which remains to be seen is if
(and how much) it is going to cost
us.

All Apologies
Dear Felix,
This letter is in response to
complaints regarding OpSoc's
poster advertising their current
production of Kander and Ebb's,
"CABARET" - in particular the
incorporation of a swastika into the
design.
We wish to apologise if this has
caused offense since this was not
what was intended.
The design depicts various
images from the musical which is
set in 1930's Berlin. The
prominence of the Swastika is
symbolic, therefore, of the over-
bearing presence of the Nazi party
in Germany, at this time.
"CABARET" is the story of two
couples and their struggle to
survive in this period. This very
serious issue is balanced by
interwoven scenes at the Kit-Kat
Nightclub where sexuality and the
need to find pleasure is
exaggerated as people attempt to
escape from the real world.
Neither the production nor the
posters convey a pro-Nazi attitude;
as anyone who comes to the show
will see - the message is quite the
opposite. We do however
apologise to those who were
disturbed by our posters; they were
Edited this week by Owain Bennallack
intended to be provocative, but in
no way to cheapen or make light of
the suffering inflicted by the Nazi's
during the Second World War.

No NUS!
Dear Owain,
I am writing in reply to L. Grogan's
letter in the last issue of FELIX. She
states in her letter that "my ICU
card does not bring any discount...
which the NUS card does". I am
wondering where she has tried to
use it, as my ICU card has been
accepted at four different cinemas,
both inside London and at home, a
theatre and two dodgy local arts
centres. Only once did someone
query why I didn't have an NUS
card that looked like everyone
else's. I explained that Imperial
was not a member of the NUS,
showed him my ULU card, and
because both cards have a photo,
they were willing to accept them as
student ID even though their policy
was specifically "a discount on
production of an NUS card". I have
even managed to get into student-
only events at NUS-run unions!
Ms. Grogan's second point is
that she can't get reductions in
stationers. I don't know whether
she realises this, but our own ICU
Bookstore sells essentials at
reduced prices anyway!
Finally, if there is somewhere
that just will not accept the ICU
card, an ISIC card is available for
only £5-6. This is valid for one year
and has the advantages of being
both an NUS-badged card, and
international. I really can't
comment on MacDonald's because
I genuinely am a veggie!
With the situation as it is we
retain our independence to make
financial decisions. We are allowed
to join in NUS marches if we agree
with the cause, so it doesn't matter
whether we join or not. And what
would happen to the CCUs if ICU
reaffiliated? It is far more
important for Imperial students to
protest about things that directly
affect them, eg. the prices in
Southside shop, and the lack of
somewhere on campus to get
CHEAP evening meals. This is what
our Union should be dealing with.
