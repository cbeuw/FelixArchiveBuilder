Benn Pulls No Punches
BY R A C H E L W A L T E R S
In a damning speech, Tony Benn
M P , attacked his party and the
state of British politics to the IC
Labour Society this week.
Speaking to a record turnout
of over 200 students, the member
of parliament for Chesterfield
dismissed the present political
system as being 'shallow,
abusive, personalised and incon-
sequential'. H e accused the
Labour Party of essentially
reforming the SDP and applied
his staunchly socialist ideology
to a wide range of issues, from
the European U n i o n and the
future of Northern Ireland to the
funding of further education.
In an emotive and often
witty speech, he said that the
removal of the current Gov-
ernment is critical to destroy the
pessimism that is inflicting the
population.
Whilst admitting that his
own party sees him simply as 'an
old dinosaur' he gave a damning
indictment of the current
parliament. Saying that the three
main stream parties are simply
following a monetarist agenda,
he joked that i f put in the same
room, they could come out with
a joint manifesto 'before you had
time to stir the coffee'.
M r Benn spoke angrily
about the high levels of
unemployment, as well as the
state of the public services,
accusing capitalism of working
by a mechanism of fear.
C r i t i c i s i n g the customer
mentality, he questioned an
Benn: No 'old dinosaur'
ideology that only provided
people with services that they
could afford.
He was asked repeatedly to
comment on the current
situation in Northern Ireland, in
the light of his invitation to
Gerry Adams to join last year's
Labour Party conference.
D e s c r i b i n g M r Adams as a
'courageous man', he suggested
that it was only a matter of time
before he received the N o b e l
Peace prize. "Mrs Thatcher was
in touch with the IRA the whole
time she was there," he claimed,
speaking of the hypocrisy of te
current bartering.
He added dramatically: "I
hope that we will move toward
the withdrawal of the British
occupational troops in Ireland."

A n Imperial student has been
threatened with deportation and
a lengthy prison term after being
charged w i t h grevious bodily
harm by Belgravia Police. The
student, a Japanese postgraduate,
is waiting to find out whether an
alleged assault on his girlfriend
w i l l lead to a Crown Court
prosecution. I f successful, it
would result in a jail sentence of
over five years.
The incident is alleged to
have taken place in the first week
of this term. Despite not being a
student at Imperial College, the
Japanese girlfriend approached
IC security i n a battered and
disoriented condition to report
the incident.
Earlier the police had
received a 999 call from a
payphone i n front of the
Mechanical Engineering Depart-
ment, but had not been able to
find the caller. When the woman
eventually appeared, security
were able to contact the police
who took a statement which led
the following day to the arrest of
the Imperial student.
Police have twice opposed
bail to the student who cannot be
named for legal reasons. B u t
after an appearance before a
judge in chambers the man has
been bailed under 'stringent'
conditions, though without
surrendering his passport.
