Term has begun again and I look forward
to seeing all my friends around college
and to the endless cycle of parties that go
on. There was a party next door last night;
a typical Imperial
College party. Two
women, fifty blokes and
academically in social circles, but at IC it's
taboo. And, if you never talk about what
you do and are never forced to defend it,
you never really question why it is you are
doing physics or mech eng or maths.
I look around my lecture theatre and
see people completely absorbed in what
they do, with only planning time for the
next piece of coursework disturbing their
concentration on the lecturer. I have
wondered why they give us so much
coursework here. I'm sure it has a lot to
do with learning. But, if our time wasn't at
such a premium, we might have time to
question what we do and, if not leave the

Editor, and Matt Park, Ents Chair 93/94).
This all-encompassing statement admits
apathy but allows the user to sit like a
monarch looking down on the rest of the
world. Of course, if there was something
they cared about deeply they would not
be vocal about it because "People here do
not care". It allows them to feel good
about being apathetic; to feel as if they
are in a position somehow nobler than the
rest. It's safe and it's smug, and it
perpetuates apathy.
Imperial College is known to churn
out graduates excelling in their chosen
a crate of Tennants
Super. The conversation
lasts 10 minutes, and then they sing songs
for the rest of the evening to a distorted
hi-fi playing a faded background tape.
'I've got a brand-new combine harvester'
begins again every half hour and the party
ends when a fight breaks out or they run
out of beer.
IC is different in that everybody
knows we do un-cool subjects. Other
people can talk about what they do
field. The token
T w o w o m e n , f i f t y b l o k e s humanities p r o -
gramme, which
c o u r s e w o r k
prevents me from
attending, goes only a little way to
providing a complete education. But the
bottom line is that graduates of Imperial
College just don't care about anything
else when they go to work. Supposedly
intelligent, they know nothing about the
world. Is this any kind of model for
others? We are meant to be among the
best in Europe - we may be, but in only
one tiny aspect of the real world.

college, become less of a machine bent
on graduating. As it is we have the
condition known as IC apathy. People so
devoted to their subject don't have time
for anything else, do they? Politics,
literature, art, current affairs, business -
all get thrown out under the pigeon-hole
of nothing to do with my degree. This is
confirmed by the particular form of dissent
available at IC: "People here do not care
