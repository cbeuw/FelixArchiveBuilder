It might seem stupid to lay the title
of the 'best english novel' on the
shoulders of Joseph Conrad's
nostromo. For a start, Conrad
wasn't even english but was born in
1857 in what was then Poland. He
didn't learn to speak english until
he was twenty but even then he
had reservations about the clean-
ness of the language especially for
expressing emotions. Yet these are
not the issues to consider - we
need not concern ourselves with
the author's nationality or his
choice of language. The 'english
novel' is a far more subtle beast
than that.
Perhaps in this specific instant
many disagree because of the
claims of 'Heart of Darkness'.
Certainly this is classic Conrad
-flitting from dusk on the Thames
to the riverboat that snakes into the
dark continent- but it doesn't really
qualify. Its length, while not
prohibitively short, must count
against it whilst the lack of a hero
figure, in lieu of a more obser-
vatory approach, is a more weighty
matter. The purple haze created by
'Apocalypse Now' has also affected
the way which we view the book.
Rather it is to 'Nostromo's' self
titled hero that we must look for the
secret ingredient.
Nostromo, the character, is not
english but an italian living in the
'country' of Costaguana. This is
important. As Conrad himself says,
"had he been an Anglo-Saxon he
would have tried to get into local
politics". The acceptability of
Nostromo himself is inherent in his
foreignness. You see that the core
of the claim that 'Nostromo' is The
English Novel rests on the fact that
the english novel is the something
that is accepted from outside. It is
the foreignness of 'Nostromo' that
makes it so powerful. Just as there
is a corner of a field that is forever
england so there is a corner of
englishness that is forever looking
outwards.
In the particular spirit of the
moment we might consider the
'englishness' of a figure like Eric
Cantona. Obviously he is not
english in a nationalistic sense yet
he has been taken to heart in a
way that players like Hoddle,
Shearer and Hughes never were or
will be. Likewise the dusty plains of
Sulaco, the exotic glitter of the San
Tome silver mine and the
revolutionary passions described
can be quintessential^ english. 0

When weaving your way through
the neon lit streets of Theatreland it
is not difficult to succumb to the
bigtime showbizz atmosphere.
However, much as I love the West
End it does have its drawbacks.
There is, however, an alternative
and it comes in the form of Fringe
Theatre
The Bush Theatre, Shepherds
Bush, is an ideal place to
experience fringe for the first time.
It is situated above a spacious pub
and has a policy of nurturing new
writers and producing new plays.
The size of the theatre creates an
intimacy unattainable in larger
venues. This intimacy has
wonderful consequences in killer
joe, an American production
brought to the Bush from Chicago.
Set in a trailer home on the
outskirts of Dallas, Texas, Killer Joe
is a fast moving and, at times,
shocking black comedy. It portrays
an American family who occupy the
lower divisions of the class league,
in a hilarious and realistic way.
The family's strenuous daily
activities involve drinking Bud,
devouring KFC and watching mind
numbing amounts of television. The
plot sits comfortably against this
backdrop of debauchery.
Chris is $6000 in debt and is
in danger of losing his face if he
fails to pay up. When he learns of
his mother's $50,000 life assurance
policy he plans to 'knock her off'
with the help of his father and his
stepmother. They decide to hire
Killer Joe Cooper, a crooked cop
who indulges in a little murdering
to supplement his income. The
nature of the operation means that
Joe won't be paid until he's
finished the job and he decides to
take Dottie, Chris' suppressed
sister, as a retainer.
The writer, Tracy Letts, has
created a cutting portrayal of a
braindead way of life. The dialogue
is engaging, inventive and
incredibly funny. Letts isn't afraid of
shocking the audience and
although the violence used is
extremely graphic at times it never
feels out of place. When added to
acting that convinces and absorbs
the product is a highly entertaining
play that has already won a Fringe
First Award and deserves continued
success. 0
