SLC Net Friendly
BY A N D Y S I N H A R A Y
The Student Loans Company
(SLC) is to join the Net. Having
been inundated with telephone
enquiries last year, Sir Eric Ash,
acting head of the S L C and
former Rector of Imperial
College, has announced plans to
answer queries by email.
Figures from the S L C have
shown that last December, its 20
telephonists were flooded by
60000 callers. T o reduce the

More well known in their other
guise as the tribute band 'Peroxide
Blondie', the group spent the day
recording around the local area, as
well as in the STOIC studio.
The band rallied together old
friends from the comedy store players
Greg Proops, Harry Hill, Richard
Vranch and Tony Hawkes to record
the song. They say "I think I'm
Jesus" is a parody of megalomania,
featuring the comedians dressed as
vicars, with firemen, surgeons and a
judge portrayed as being power-
crazy.
Speaking to F E L I X , Ian from
Shrink said that they were running a
really tight budget and were pleased
to be able to take advantage of
STOIC's facilities. "The studio is
perfect because it's so small," he
explained.
STOIC have said that they will
be showing interviews with the
comedians the week after next, and
that the video itself is due to come
out at the end of the year.

the incident and not to travel
more than one mile from the
college itself.
Following this and a lesser
assault before Christmas of which
college security were also aware,
the girlfriend returned to Japan
to obtain treatment for kidney
damage and to receive laser
number of callers Sir Eric has
turned to the internet: "It seems
to me that email is a much better
way of making standard
enquiries."
Internet access w i l l be
provided by the Joint Academic
Network w h i c h connects the
country's higher educational
establishments together. It is
through these higher education
colleges and universities that
most of the emails are expected
since few students have the
therapy around her eyes.
The case, which could now
go to a committal hearing to
decide whether it will be heard
by a Magistrates or Crown court,
highlights an increase in the
number of incidents at Imperial
College this year. P C Clive
Coleman, the homebeat officer
for Imperial's area, expressed
grave concern at the incidents:
means of sending the messages
from home.
Sir Eric is currently a
Professor at the Physics and
Astronomy Department at U C L ,
however, during his time as
Rector at Imperial from 1986 to
1993, many saw h i m as the
champion of college wide email.
At present, all students at
Imperial College should have
access to email facilities.
"The behaviour of students this
year is not up to college
standards."
Suggesting that publicity
surrounding this incident could
help, and warning that students
should not expect to get away
with violent crime, PC Coleman
remarked: "If somebody else has
got certain things in mind like
that they might think twice."

Imperial College students
shunned Cabinet M i n i s t e r ,
David Hunt M P , when only 12
people turned out for his talk last
Wednesday. In a clash with
Tony Benn, speaking at the same
time on the other side of college,
he came off by far the worst even
though he described his more
popular opponent as a 'has been'.
The relatively u n k n o w n
cabinet minister was greeted on
arrival by Sir Ronald Oxburgh,
Rector of Imperial College, but
faced a more frosty response
from the few Conservative
Students who showed up. The
group, who had fervently
welcomed Eurosceptics, dis-
agreed repeatedly with the 'very
strong European' views of the
Cabinet Minister. He dismissed
the Conservative Eurosceptics as
being 'a very small minority of
M P s ' , but blamed current
problems on the instability of a
Government with a small
parliamentary majority. The
Cabinet M i n i s t e r emphasised
how the whole Cabinet had
agreed that Britain should stay
in the European U n i o n , and
'fight for British interests'.
The immediate prospects of
the Conservative party for
improved public support are not
very good, according to David
Hunt. In a veiled attack on the
chancellor, he placed the blame
squarely on his party's decision
to raise taxes, a step which he
described as being the most
'unconservative' action possible.
Though in an allusion to future
tax cuts, M r H u n t promised
those present that the current
unpopularity 'would not last'.
T u r n i n g to the subject of
health, he pre-empted the
decision by the Higher
Education Funding Council of
England and the Department of
Health, in clearly suggesting that
the Â£60 m i l l i o n new Basic
Medical Science building would
be built. Encouraging scientists
to speak to the media, David
Hunt also hinted how medical
science 'is going to become more
and more a feature here at
Imperial'.
