The results from last term
confirmed IC as clearly the best
team in the London leagues, and
showed a depth that we have
never had before, after some
initial problems with the
structure of the teams, the order
settled down and our class became
apparent. The 1st team, under
Adam Waddington, were clear
winners of division 1 and will be
joined this term by the 2nd team
who convincingly won the second
division. Andrew Harrower led
the 3rd team to the division 3
title, aided by some good perfor-
mances from Regis Gontier late
in the season. The 4th team just
missed promotion to division 2,
finishing third-clearly ahead of
the fourth placed team. The 5th
team had a solid season, finishing
mid-table in division 4. all this
bodes well for the future with a
lot of our players having a few
years left at IC.
Football El
ICAFCIV us KCH II
Skillful navigation saw us reach
the K C H sports ground shortly
before nightfall. However, this
did not prevent IC turning in a
strong performance culminating
in our first win this term. Clinical
finishing earned Ross a well-
deserved hat-trick, while Hector
Kept goal superbly at the other
end. K C H managed a single goal
in reply, but the result was never
in doubt.
ICAFC IVvs Kings IV
Another victory for the resurgent
fourths, this time away to Kings
at Berrylands. Playing with the
wind in the first forty-five
minutes, IC pressed forward but
were unable to score. However, a
piece of eccentric Grobelar-style
goal-keeping and good work by
Ross set up Chris Collison for a
well taken goal. IC then held on
for the remaining forty minutes,
with solid performances from the
back four and keeper Dominic.
The midfield also performed well,
driving their centre-forward to a
near nervous breakdown on the
train back to Waterloo.
Thanks to all who took part -
particularly Ross (navigation &

goals), Ian and Euan (psychologi-
cal warfare). Well done - the run
is set to continue for the
remainder of the season.
Water Polo 0
IC Progress to UAU semi-finals...
Imperial College Water Polo team
battled it out with Cambridge and
Nottingham for a place in the semi-
finals of the U A U tournament.
Against Cambridge, IC led 2-0
after the first quarter with goals
from Daniel Halls and Stueart
Collins, but fell back after some
minor defensive errors to lose 5-7.
Against Nottingham we
pulled back from 3-4 down in the
third quarter to win 6-5. This
enables us to progress to the next
stage of the championships, to be
held in Liverpool on the 27th Feb
1995.
Special efforts by Harry 'The
Hitman' Hearns and Theo
Paptheodosou, the Greek
international forward, ensured
the win with three goals and
assists between them.
Hockey
IC Ladies 2nd vs Wye College
The final score did not reflect the
balance of the play. We domi-
nated throughout the game but
Wye were able to score from one
lucky opening. We increased the
pressure during the second half
but were unable to produce the
clinical finishing of previous
weeks. Nevertheless, the overall
performance was impressive.
IC Mens 1st vs Royal London Hospital
When IC Rugby were too nancy to play
Imperial Hockey washed Royal London away
On the coach we all sat 6 seats apart
Their players weren't there so we had a late start
Ivor to a knee to his head
"Hoorah" we cheered, "he must be dead"
Half-time arrived, scores still nil-nil
Ian inspired us to go for the kill
So we built up pressure and created a hole
Bill T.C. was there to score a great goal
Then Son ofSatan tried to start a fight
Lardy sent him off to teach him what's right
They couldn't take advantage of the extra man
And our Frenchman resistedfrom kicking a fan
The last 10 minutes were a bit of a hash
But we held our lead and won the match.

Fencing
ICvs Essex university
The Imperial College Fencing
Squad won decisively (16 to 13)
over the University of Essex on
December 18. It was a rough ride
for the epeeists, but excellent
performances by the sabre and
foil lads was sufficient to
guarantee victory. In February
the team will go to meet Queen
Mary and Westfield College in the
second elimination round and it
is sure to be a tough and exciting
fight.
Team members were Alex
Davies, Reuben Kalam and Nick
Manton for Foil. For Epee we had
Reuben Kalam, Chris Moon and
Chris Ince. Finally, the team for
Sabre was Nick Manton, Alex
Davies and Sean Jauss.
UAU Individuals Competition
A few of the Squad members
headed up to Keele University on
January 6-9 for a few days of
intense competition. Though no
trophies return to Imperial, all of
the Squad did excellently and had
themselves a great time (occasion-
ally to the expense of competit-
ion!). Special mention goes to
Monica who was the first woman
to compete for the Imperial
Fencing Squad in some time, and
very successfully too, and to Nick
who hung around all three days.
Results:
Foil: Nick Manton - 31st
Alex Davies - 35th
Monica P. Alurada - 13th
Epee: Nick Manton - 31st
Reuben Kalam - 38th
Monica P. Alurada - 11th
Sabre: Nick Manton - 32nd
