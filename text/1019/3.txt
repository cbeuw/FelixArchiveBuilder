King's Ransom
King's President Ghassan Karian
is to publish a document
outlining three potential
alternative methods of student
funding. The first proposal is a
higher rated Graduate Tax,
which he believes w i l l be "a
fairer system in the long run."
Other proposals include the
Australian-style 'fees income
contingent loan' and a 'main-
tenance income contingent loan'.
Interestingly, the document is to
be sponsored by The Guardian
and The Times Higher Education
Supplement.
College Maintenance.
Some of you may have been
wondering why there is a hole in
D a l b y Court whilst a similar
transformation, complete with
miniature derrick, is being
completed around the Sherfield
Security Desk.
Subterranean maintenance
work i n Dalby Court has
commenced to replace sections of
pipe running the length of the
Court. Multiple fractures have
appeared in the cast iron water
mains due to frost damage and
old age. It is being replaced with
a more resistant polypropylene
pipe. Maintenance work and the
multitude of water springs
should have subsided by
Monday.
Meanwhile, the Sherfield
Security C o n t r o l is being
expanded to accommodate new
security alarm equipment and
consoles. When complete it will
appear more aesthetic and
provide an enhanced reception
service for academic visitors and
guests to the college.
Election Rumour and Gossip
BY A N D R E W T S E N G ,

^ Â» A T
' c Speculation is rife this
week in the build up
m p P f c f j ; to the Imperial
College Union (ICU)
sabbatical elections.
With papers for the sabbatical
posts of President, Deputy
President (Finance & Services),
Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) and F E L I X Editor
going up on Monday there has
been intense rumour and gossip
surrounding possible future
sabbaticals.
Recent constitutional
changes have wreaked havoc with
the annual election rumour-
mongering. T h e I C U C o u n c i l
meeting has historically been the
place were potential candidates
are first spotted as they find out
how the union works. However,
with only one Council meeting
having taken place speculators
have had to go elsewhere this
year.
Instead, changes i n the
Elections Committee are proving
to be a strong indication of
possible candidates. Of the eight
names initially pulled out of a hat
to be on the Elections Committee
or as a reserve, four of them have
declared an interest i n the
elections: L u k e Gietzen, SCC
Chair, Charlie Bell, R C S U
President, Rosalind Prophett,
R S M U Academic Affairs Officer
and V i n o d Ferandez, R S M U
President. L u k e Gietzen, SCC
Chair, is believed to be seeking
the job of Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies). However, the
reasons for a conflict are less
obvious in the other three union
officials. F E L I X understands
that Charlie Bell is not intending
to stand, though whether he is
involved in a campaign to get a
Mines official into the
Presidency or is supporting a
RCSU campaign is unclear.
Outside of the Elections
Committee various other
rumours abound: following
recent publicity in F E L I X , some
have suggested that H e l e n
Teasdale, I C U Steward and
ordinary member of council and
Jane Hoyle, former Rag Chair,
are considering a joint campaign
for the Presidency and the post of
Deputy President (Finance &
Services) respectively.
Contenders for the
remaining post of F E L I X Editor
and Print Unit Manager are thin
on the ground due to a dirth of
final year students and a lack of
people w i s h i n g to take a year
long break from their studies.
However, of the final year
students at F E L I X , Marcus
Alexander, Columns Editor, Paul
Dias, the mastermind behind the
design and layout of this year's
F E L I X and Rachel Walters,
News Journalist and occasional
News Editor, are thought to be
interested in running for the job.
Each candidate must be
proposed by a full member of
I C U and seconded by twenty
others. Nominations will close
when papers come down on
Friday 17th February after which
campaigning for all posts may
begin. New Election w i l l also
standing for all posts.
The Beast of Bodmin Moors
Well, as another duskily clad
maiden day passes beyond my
jaded gaze... hahaha. Seriously, I
was very pleased to note the
appearance of college pub-
lications called ' F E E L S I K ' and
' F I D O ' last week although I
think the editors of both may
have been misled in their market
research. After all, ' F E E L S I K '
sounds a little like F E L I X
doesn't it? And come to think of
it the content was familiar...
H m m m m m , maybe those
vital news disks stolen by that
daring gang who dynamited the
doors of F E L I X T O W E R S
weren't nicked by the Microclub
after all...
Cabaret
I had quite a good night on
Tuesday, courtesy of the Operatic
Society. Without wishing to say
too much, lest my comments be
taken as ironic and my magazine
be pinched, it was really rather
good. The plot bounces along to a
soundtrack of burlesque, lusty
performances and no, the
swastika on the poster doesn't
proclaim the latest outpourings
of NaziSoc. Obviously, the
opposite message is sent and the
show ends at the brink of the
Nazi's brief but visibly appaling
reign. I think there are still
tickets left for Friday and the
Saturday night finale so why not?
Elections
Don't forget the sabbatical papers
go up on Monday. If you feel like
trying for any of the posts then
sign your name up, together with
a proposer and twenty seconders,
opposite the Union office. Don't
forget that you should talk to the
current holder of whatever post
you seek to stand fcr, to make
sure you know what you're
letting yourself in for!
Election Publicity
Also, if you've already decided
you're standing for any of the
posts, printing your promotion
material (ie. propaganda) will
probably by cheaper than
photocopying it. We can print
flyers, A3 and A4 posters etc in
the P r i n t U n i t but we have only
a limited time slot in which to fit
in all those interested so come
and see us ASAP. You cannot put
up publicity before papers come
down but you will probably want
your material ready by then.
