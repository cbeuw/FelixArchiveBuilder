Counselling can help but still has a stigma
attached to it.
It may be a very British 'stiff upper lip'
attitude of not wanting to admit that anything
is wrong. But it doesn't have to be like this.
Matt told me his story about the depression
that nearly ruined his PhD.
"Things were going from bad to worse.
I just didn't think my work was good enough
and didn't think I could make it through this
degree. For months I was having difficulty
motivating myself or believing my own ideas,
I couldn't sleep. I started to put on weight and
smoke too much, I looked and felt really bad
and thought that the only way out was to quit
my PhD and get away from
all the pressures. I really
was at my wits' end when I
went to see a councillor at
college. But it really helped.
I just realised that I was
punishing myself and that I
should have more confidence. Nothing to do
with my work has changed; it's my attitude to
it that matters. I just believe in myself more."
For Matt it was just a question of
finding someone completely independent of
his friends and family whom he could confide
in. This is a common problem in depression.
You feel as if your problems are not even
worth an airing, or you just don't want to
burden friends and family with another tale of
woe. This is where counselling can help.
However, although the public perception of
counselling is becoming more positive as
people learn more about different therapies,
the prevailing view is still that you should
" p u l l your socks up and pull yourself
together." But prejudice against therapy is
more complicated than this. " A lot of people
don't want it i n their notes", says D r
Weinreb. "It may affect your medical
insurance. There is a stigma."
The treatment available for depression
varies according to individual needs and

desires. Dr Weinreb says "People are assessed
by what they want as treatment. Some people
w i l l prefer drugs to therapy and others
therapy to drugs. Prescriptions will make
people feel better in some ways but won't take
away the underlying problem."
The medication available has limited
use. Although it lifts patients' moods - or
numbs them - it really has no medical effect
on the cause of depression, which is not
completely understood. Recent work has
suggested that manic depressive conditions
are heritable; the extent of the environment's
influence remains contentious.
I've learned a lot about depression while
researching this article. What disturbs me is
the lack of public awareness and the
consequent victimisation of people who admit
suffering from depression. There is no doubt
that society does not know how to deal with
mental illness: you only have to walk the
streets of L o n d o n to see this much. But
people are making an effort. I spoke to Emma
Barton of the Samaritans, usually
seen as a "last resort" for the
suicidal: " W e are constantly
trying to encourage people to
ring us before things get too
bad." Saneline, another
telephone help service, is staffed
by volunteers expert in offering support and
advice on different kinds of mental illness.
A n d i f you want one-to-one counselling,
there's the college health centre, where D r
Weinreb advises: " A l l the staff here have
some degree of counselling skills and we can
help." These are genuine offers of help, so
don't be afraid to ask. 13
