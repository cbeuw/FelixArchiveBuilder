The annual M i d - t e r m Parlia-
mentary cricket match is very
much an atypical affair. It is
contested in the dark, cold and
bitter winter months, between
the Government X I and
Opposition X I . Y o u r sketch
writer was there, privy to the
drama that unfolded. T h e
members stand was packed to
capacity with a proliferate of
prols. The aristocrats, refined and
splendid, sat patiently and aloof
in the Lords' pavillion.
First, and most definitely
foremost, came the majestic
splendour of Madame Umpire.
She seemed to float effortlessly
on an air of puritan authority.
Sublime. H e r downy rump
settled at the Nursery End, aka
the Member's stand.
Then, to a stupendous roar
and much waving of score cards,
emerged the contesting members.
Firstly, the Government X I , led
by captain J. 'straight bat' Major
and his ample lieutenant,
K.Clarke. The business thus far
had proven to be 'most
disagreeable'. T h e T o r y
willowmiesters had procured a
first innings disaster. Weak
leadership from the captain, and
a middle order collapse due to
bitter i n f i g h t i n g , further
amplified by the deft
performance of the Opposition
X I i n the field, had left the
Government X I stumped.
Next, the O p p o s i t i o n
captain Tony 'AB' Blair took the
field, followed by vice captain
J. 'Heffer' Prescott. T h e y
promptly took guard from
Madame Umpire, and awaited the
crafty ball play known as a Tory
backlash.
Captain Major set his field
thus: A t 'silly point', sledging
Euro-tripe, was Teressa Gorman.
At no middle wicket stood David
Mellor, paying no attention to the
on field action, but instead
carefully stage managing a press
conference. U p in the company
sponsored hospitality boxes sat
the pampered botty of J. Aitken,
who was absolutely not accepting
bribes to table motions i n the
Members stand
The two batsmen played
w i t h a consummate ease. A B
drove ample boundaries against
the assorted googlies and wrong
'uns, thrown by the Government
attack. Not even the old 'Clause
4' delivery could scuttle this lad.
In a fit of euphoria, the 'Heffer'
was seen to make strange
gesticulations at the fielding side.
When asked later what he meant
by this, he said he was merely
trying to illustrate 'that it was all
in the wrist'.
All-in-all, the Opposition
X I creamed the Government's
tepid attack, easily winning the
fixture. However, all were agreed
that the up and coming 'General
Election' match was of far greater
importance. I n this, the
Government X I had a 4-0 series
lead. But, unless the green shoots
of political recovery burst
through the worn and dusty Tory
wicket, and soon, the lead might
well be reduced to 4-1.

The muse which has decided to
hold your good, dear Frater in his
endlesss tangles this week is the
rather bizarre paradoxical dual
entitiy of the genius and the fool.
In a somewhat unusual
series of electro-correspondences,
an acquaintance of mine chose to
let me be aware that my inspirator
is one who attracted the fool and
the genius with equal measure.
Thus one asks - are the two ideals
like one another, or does there
exist a difference betwixt them.
Ordinarily this question calls
for little thought, but it's become
the most pressing concern, for
C.C. Aff*.iwer>.

however I investigate it, the
entanglements abound. It is a
devilish little dilemma for which
easy solutions do not appear. All
vibrant genii can be branded as
imbeciles in a single stroke, and
lifted back to greatness and fame
in the next.
Now more than ever, when
all idolatry is media enhanced, the
love for a celebrity depends on the
length of news reports about him.
Outrageous actions lead to instant
fame and instant infamy. Looking
underneath this glamour, this
superficiality, one finds nothing.
Although these ramblings
look to be lacking in intellectual
light, there is a greater motive here
of which I cannot mention aloud.
Whether or not anyone can even
hope to receive the title of a genius
in this random age, there is no
major excuse for failing to try. Even
if one's actions brand one a fool,
never let that be an obstacle.

What is this all really about, you
may be asking yourselves. Has
your good Frater slipped beyond
the bounds of comprehensibility for
good, or is there a hidden agenda
to his seemingly confused
utterances. Well, is it right that I
should answer such a question or
not? It would seem however that
the nature of this column tends
towards an emulation of the topic
today under discussion. Is your
Frater a genius, or is he but a fool?
He tends to choose the latter.
Being a fool has many advantages;
the simplicity of the fool's world
allows him to reveal hidden truths
without even realising it. The
seemingly unstructured nature of
his actions can confound the devil
himself, and have allowed the poor
fool to escape many an hazardous
occasion. But within this simplicity,
this spreading entropy, there is the
light of truth that is only damaged
by the oppressive thoughts of the
genius. Give up, I say, and become
the simpleton of the first, initial
times. The Fool is Zero, the first of
the trumps. He is beneath them all,
and master of them all. He is the
first and the last, and he remains
for ever; as do I, your good and
confounded Frater. After Confused
Ramblings On Senseless Topics I
Call Up Sanity. Is that it?
