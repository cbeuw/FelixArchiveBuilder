Bookshop News
Diaries All 1982 diaries are now half-price. Y o u still have ten
months to go!
As you know I try to keep you all up-to-date with new titles written
by people in some way connected with the College, this week I
would like to mention a book that we, the Bookshop get asked for
from people all over the world. Battery Car Conversions, £2.80
B.J. Prigmore — F . C . Wykes — A . T . Freeman.
This book is now in its second reprint. Though there are many
books on battery vehicles, none of them provide the background
needed by those who wish to convert existing cars. O n c e a
battery car is available and running, it can become a test bed for
bright ideas. What is needed in wider circles is the service
experience arising from the conversion. The authors have
perhaps unwittingly created what we call a truely international
book.
