Beaumont on a sticky wicket
The Left Alliance anti-apartheid campaign started on Wednesday
lunchtime when three prominent members of pressure groups
addressed a relatively small audience in Huxley Theatre 213.
L o r d Beaumont, former L i b e r a l Party C h a i r m a n , began
proceedings by saying that apartheid was a bad thing and we certainly
shouldn't support the regime in any way, but it was perfectly alright to
play cricket with them.
M r Cosmos Desmond, a former director of Amnesty International,
purported that the regime was due to the logic of capitalism and not
reason. M r Desmond stated that the whiteman had come to South
Africa for the sole reason of exploiting the land and its people and had
soon developed a ruthlessly effective method of control. It became
taken for granted that the state would determine where you live, who
you can marry even where you can be buried. A more recent
phenomenon is the placing of blacks in trible homelands now that their
labour has been superseded by machines.
A more radical line was taken by M r Abdul S. Minty, Honorary
Secretary for the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who accused the West of
actively supporting the brutal regime by not supplying arms to African
front line states whilst supplying South Africa with sophisticated radar
equipment. Sanctions, he stated, are the only peaceful weapon at the
West's disposal, so in lifting sanctions Reagan is giving support to
South Africa's aggressive stance towards front line states.
Engineering
Chief at IC
Sir Kenneth Corfield, Chairman
of the Engineering C o u n c i l ,
addressed the Industrial Society
on Tuesday. With the Rector in
the Chair Sir Kenneth spoke on
what a university education
should be and the British manu-
facturing industry.
IC's four year engineering
courses were praised whilst other
courses were criticised for not
covering economics. Sir Kenneth
warned against overspecialisation
and condemned "the blinkered
approach" it produces. His idea
would be long, broad courses
resembling the American system,
with high entrance requirements.
Sir Kenneth was concerned
about the image engineering has
of simply "getting your hands
d i r t y " and said the status of
engineers must be raised, although
raising salaries isn't the entire
solution.
Bemoaning shoddy goods, Sir
Kenneth said consumers must be
discriminating and buy high
quality products. He applauded
the various Standards Institutes
and consumer bodies, and hoped
that their work would help
prevent major British industries
dying, like the motorcycle and
camera industries already have.
London Student
to fold?
The election for the next Editor
of London Student (formerly
Sennet) has been deferred
because of doubt over the paper's
future.
The paper is currently running
at a loss and it is not certain that
the post will be sabbatical next
year. In addition the current
Editor, Miss Sarah Laithwaite, is
to resign at the end of this term
because of exams. Although Miss
Laithwaite is a sabbatical she
deferred her final exams last year
which means she must sit them
next term.
However this hasn't prevented
London Student from organising a
number of events for other
student newspapers in London.
O n Saturday a teach-in was
organised to demonstrate the
basic principles ol news reporting
whilst on Tuesday the London
Student Journalist Group met.
Although the group has yet to
elect a committee acting chair-
person. Miss Karen Marchbank.
has agreed to arrange a speaker
meeting for early next term. It is
hoped to have Duncan Campbell,
from the ,\Wc Statesman, as the
speaker.

M U S I C celebrated its centenary
on Sunday, February 28, but was
unable to display the large
banner which had been especially
prepared for the centenary.
The banner had originally
been hung from the front of the
R C M b u i l d i n g the previous
Friday but was removed on the
same day. During the raid it is
alleged a window was broken,
the banner dirtied and that some
of the fittings on the flagpole
were broken.
The banner was returned to
the R C M by R o y a l School of
Mines LInion President, M r Ross
Baxter, on the Saturday evening.
M r Baxter had found it in t he-
Mines Building and the Royal
C o l l e g e of M u s i c h o p e t h a t
R S M U will pay for the damage
caused.
H o w e v e r , the b a n n e r was
unable to be used on the day of
the c e n t e n a r y because it was
dirty.
