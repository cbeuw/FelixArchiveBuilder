Cross Country
The National Cross Country Championships
were held last Saturday i n Leeds, and a
g r o u p o f I C r u n n e r s took the s p e c i a l l y
chartered train to attend the event. Although
it was a fine and clear day i n L o n d o n , i n
Leeds a strong wind blew with a light rain
accompaniment.
T e a m quality was marred significantly by
the fact that most, if not all, of our best
runners are injured in one way or another at
present.
This then is the excuse for our junior team
comprising J . Frost, R . Morrison, E. Jones
and A . Powell finished 430th, 462nd, 476th
and 477th respectively out of a field of about
550 over the six mile course.
O n l y two seniors managed to come to the
event, R . Weston a n d I. Matthews, w h o
came 1440th and 1520th respectively out of a
field of about 1800 runners over their nine
mile course.
The day as a whole was quite a success
with entertainment o n the return journey
consisting o f a comprehensive study of the
d i m m i n g c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f B r i t i s h R a i l
electric light bulbs over a three and a quarter
mile journey.
L a s t l y I w o u l d like to note that the
photographer at the Hyde Park Relay was
Fred Popplewell whom I neglected to thank
last week.

Dear Marge/Lesley
This friend of mine has got a problem,
usually he is used to going out on a Saturday
afternoon and giving the opposition a severe
thrashing. This week however his confidence
has been u n d e r m i n e d after a defeat by
R i c h m o n d , a really awfully nice bunch of
chaps. H e and his team had to cope with a
most disturbing set of circumstances—would
you like to be playing hockey at the L o n d o n
W e l s h R F C g r o u n d o n the d a y o f t h e
E n g l a n d / W a l e s rugby international? H a v i n g
everyone for miles around you drunk, when
you have got to go and play hockey does no
good to the nerves. M y friend's nerves were
further jangled when R i c h m o n d scored twice
within the first ten minutes, with the added
stress of playing o n an all-weather pitch, he
and his team-mates did well to keep playing.
Eventually goals from Simon Witter and
Simon G r a y levelled the scores, only for
R i c h m o n d to score the winner very near the
end. This of course was just too much tor my
f r i e n d — I w o n d e r i f y o u c a n suggest a n
institution or a rest cure—I was thinking of
Barbados myself, or maybe the Seychelles

In extremely-blustery conditions, Imperial
played into the wind in the first half on a cool
Saturday morning. They worked well with a
team showing a number of changes. T h e
second row combined well i n the tight to
produce some good possession i n often
difficult circumstances a n d M a r k Johsnon
was especially vigorous i n the loose.
The first try came from J . Paixao after fine
play from the backs with C h a p m a n actually
moving the ball. Reading replied with a
penalty late i n the first half after the solid
Imperial defence held up against persistent
pressure.
Playing with the wind in the second half,
there was some excellent tactical kicking
f r o m B o u c h e r at f l y - h a l f a n d c o n s t a n t
attacking produced two tries. O n e was by
Hudson w h o later converted Pike's which
was under the posts. M o r e points should have
been scored by Imperial who were encamped
in the Reading half for the remainder of the
match.
Team: /. Magnus, M. Winsor, G. Pike, W.

&Water Polo
Last Saturday I C Water Polo team took on
Oxford University in an interesting match
which was characterised by excessive verbal
and physical violence.
T h e m a t c h started b a d l y for I C , a n d
matters were not helped by the fact that Last
and Ashwin were both still suffering from a
lunchtime session. W e went 4-1 down after
two quarters, despite some good play by
Burnett in goal; our only goal was a penalty
from Leach, C a r t o n as usual not keeping
his cool very successfully, was sent out yet
again, for the fourth match running, a n d
Ashwin was involved in a brief slanging
match with an opposition player.
The last two quarters went rather better,
as our two drunks sobered up and our attack
became belter organised. Boucher started a
light in the shallow end, just to keep the
match lively, a n d shortly after that o u r
second goal was put in by Last while Leach
restrained the man marking h i m .
H o w e v e r , o u r i m p r o v e m e n t was n o t
enough to make a lull comeback, and the
game ended as a disappointing 6-2 defeat for
IC.
Football
O n a windy spring afternoon the First X I
strode boldly onto the pitch, accompanied by
those nice quiet boys from Goldsmiths.
A s p e r u s u a l I C lost t h e toss a n d
consequently kicked off, the whistle being
drowned by the raucous, mainly drunken
Goldsmiths supporters. A frantic start to the
m a t c h was w e l l i l l u s t r a t e d b y R e e v e ' s
blatant, but entertaining tackle/foul.
After ten minutes, Goldsmiths opened the
scoring, with a beautilully lluent move from
IC. L a y hit a screaming forty yard ball to
Niccolls who completely miss-hit it to Reeve,
who promptly finished, lobbing the mouse-
like Aled Williams.
T h e game c o n t i n u e d from c r u n c h i n g
tackle to stiff talking to from the ref to even
more c r u n c h i n g tackle. T h e w o r s t / b e s t
example was the late-ish tackle on Steve
Ward, the I C Captain, by a Goldsmiths
forward, which resulted in him getting a stiff
left-hook from said captain!
However, minutes later his revenge was
sweet. Dunhill turned the ball back to the
edge of the Goldsmiths penalty area where
W a r d had beat the a d v a n c i n g defence.
Instant control and a cool clinical lob left the
goalkeeper stranded with W a r d racing away
to acknowledge the adulation(?) o f the
Goldsmiths crowd.
As the final seconds of normal time ticked
away, Williams was twice called upon to
make cat-like saves to keep the scores level.
The final whistle blew, heralding extra-time..
During the first half of extra time I C began
to d o m i n a t e . T h i s w a s h e l p e d b y t h e
opposition falling down like flies with cramp.
IC finally reaped the reward of their efforts as
Rickard thundered the ball into the net. T h e
second half saw 'controlled' defence by I C , as
Steve W a r d cleared the b a l l o u t o f the
stadium. T h e final whistle brought ecstatic
scenes as the nearly hoarse supporters joined
the team in the celebrations that continued
late into the night. The whole team would
like to thank all the supporters who helped to
send them on their way. i
Team: A. Williams, J. Lay, S. Dunhill, K.
Reeve, S. Ward, A. Page, P. .Niccolls, D. FAsby,

It was a bright, sunny day (morning). As the
day broke I C Seconds turned u p at the

assortment of dinner suits, H a w a i i a n shirts
a n d knee l e n g t h j e a n s . W e a r r i v e d at
Motspur Park just after 10:15am.
Then we kicked off (after R o n lost toss),
kicking uphill against wind. They looked
quite big, but we soon cut them down to size,
alter stringing a lew passes together, we took-
the lead with a disputed goal (through Steve
Rimmer) against the run of play. Soon after
John Burns slotted another, and after a wind
assisted Q M C goal half-time arrived with
the score 2-1 in IC's favour. The second half
started very slowly, with Q M C III giving as
good as they got until A n d y Hartland scored
his first, this was soon followed by a rare
header (by Rimmer) into the back of the net
(from a J o h n B u r n s t h r o w i n ) . T h e n
Hartland scored his second, V e e n m a n went
off to be replaced by Flanagan and we won 5-1.
