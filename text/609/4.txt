Have y o u ever thought about opera? I wouldn't bother if I were you. I
don't know what all the fuss is about. Anyway, after much confusion
caused by previous S T O I C articles in F E L I X , I though I would spend the
next two hundred words answering one or two of your questions.
1. N o , the only change will be a rather wet radio.
2. Y e s , Mike Hackett is a wimp "off screen" as well!
3. This is possibly dangerous, your appliance may need adjustment
later.
4. A s far as we know in S T O I C * it has always been a bright red colour.
5. N o , we don't have a 'Quantel' unit (PS what is one?) (PPS ask IC
Radio).
6. Maybe later when the lights are off.
7. Y e s , with your right hand.
8. Y e s , Mike Hackett is a wimp " o n screen" as well!
9. N o , it's O K , we get cotton from the College doctor.
10. It is a pity you can't receive IC Radio in colour.

Edmund Kean
Edmund who? — Kean: the most
famous Shakespearean tragedean
ever to set foot on stage. A couple
of w e e k s ago w a s t h e 168th
anniversary of his first perfor-
mance as Richard III at Drury
Lane. " O n e of the finest pieces of
acting we have ever beheld, or
p e r h a p s t h e s t a g e h a s ever
known," wrote the Morning Post.
Lord Byron went even further:
"Life, nature, truth — without
exaggeration or diminuition."
This most famous tragedean,
whose name will now trip lightly
off your tongues, will it not?, was
as potent off the stage as on; he
s o m e t i m e s b o a s t e d of h a v i n g
three w o m e n d u r i n g a perfor-
mance—the audience having to
wait until he had finished.
"Well?" you say.
"Well, so now you know."
Industrial
G'day everybody! Long no see,
eh? Well, blame the elections for
our non-article last week. I hope
you enjoyed Sir Kenneth Corfield's
'Do' on Tuesday, if you knew about
his visit!
Din-dins! Yes folks, we're having
a Dinner on Monday night (March
15). It's to be at West Centre Hotel,
Earls Court, so meet there at 8:00,
£6-7 a head.
All those who went to the Daily
Mail (and were 'bombed') don't for-
get you're going again on Wed-
nesday, March 17, in the evening.
Wellsoc
A short note to tell you all that papers are up in all the departments for
posts o n the Wellsoc Committee. B e you a failed hack who has come off
the worst in recent Union elections or that much maligned entity 'the
a v e r a g e I C s t u d e n t ' , this is your chance to do s o m e t h i n g really
worthwhile.
A l s o coming up soon is the Wellsoc Annual Dinner, which will not be a
Mooney. Instead it will be held at the Penta Hotel on Thursday, March
25. Prof Laithwaite will be the main speaker and Martin S. Taylor will be
dazzling everyone with his magic. Excellent value at £9, from Mike
Sturgess via Chemistry U G pigeon-holes or at lectures.
Speaking of lectures, be sure to be at next Monday's lecture on
H o u d i n i b y L a r r y B a r n e s f r o m t h e M a g i c C i r c l e , w h o will be
demonstrating a few escapes. W e shall have a film for our A G M on
M a r c h 22, Eraserhead, which is a brilliant black comedy, very well made,
free to everyone at the A G M .
Wine
Next Tuesday is the Cheese and
Wine Party and A G M (6:00pm,
Union S C R ) . Anyone interested in
standing for a post on the commit-
tee s h o u l d contact me (Dave
Marshall) as soon as possible.
Fifty people braved the Wine
Soc Dinner last Tuesday (pre-
c e d e d by a C a l i f o r n i a n wine
tasting) and a good (alcoholic)
time was had by all. After tasting
six Californian wines (and con-
trasting French and Australian
wines) we proceded through four
quality wines and port with the
dinner.
Next week we have planned a
vineyard trip to Kent (yes wine is
made in England!) followed by
a n o t h e r d i n n e r i n a n i d y l l i c
riverside setting.
United Nations
This Tuesday we're showing a film
in association with Anti-Apartheid
Soc Generation of Resistance-a
documentary about the struggle of
black South Africans to obtain
political status in South Africa.
In the next couple of weeks
there will be a talk given by a
representative from the Canadian
H i g h C o m m i s s i o n a n d at the
beginning of next term we'll be
having a speaker from the South
A f r i c a n E m b a s s y itself. I hope
you'll c o m e along to all these
meetings as they should be very
interesting and informative.
Finally, I'd like to urge you to
support the Left Alliance which
has been set up in College and is
at the moment campaigning in
support for Anti-Apartheid.
Tickets are still available for the
Annual Dinner on March 19. W e
have gone to quite a lot of effort to
get you an edible (i.e non-Mooney)
meal, so we would like to see as
many people there as possible.
Either ask your dep rep or come
to the union office and say that the
tickets are in the H o n See's pigeon-
hole (but not in the biblical sense).
Meanwhile, Rag limps on after a
fashion. O n Wednesday afternoon
we will be sending people all over
London. to sell Rag Mags ( R C S
Office, 2:00pm) and the week after
I h o p e t o t a k e a m i n i b u s to
Guildford.
The Mopsoc A G M will be held
on T u e s d a y , M a r c h 23, so all
members go along to vote.
Finally, if anyone would be
interested in editing the R C S
Handbook for next year, don't
hesitate to come and see us.

SF Soc
As the Mann himself is away, I'm lumbered with writing the bulletin.
Advance warning—next term, on May 4 we will be showing The Rocky
Horror Picture Show with all the trimmings. All those in appropriate
fancy dress will be admitted free. This will be immediately followed by our
A G M , so if you would like to help run a great soc next year, come to a
Thursday (1:00pm, Green C o m m Rm) library meeting, and let this year's
lot know. They are the bunch pictured above (below, left or wherever
Mark put the picture) with Chris Priest and Lisa Tuttle.
That's all folks!
