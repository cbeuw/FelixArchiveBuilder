Elections
he Returning Officer has decided that the
challenge to election procedure at yesterday's
Jesuits U G M was unconstitutional.
This means that no valid objection to the
action Committee's ratification of the posts
w a s l o d g e d a n d h e n c e , a c c o r d i n g to the
constitution, Steve Goulder, Phil Greenstreet,
M a r y F r e e m a n a n d M a r t i n S. T a y l o r are
deemed elected.
This decision will be very confusing to most
you. M a r c o Ledwold's decision was based on
the part of the election rules which outlines
criteria by w h i c h s o m e o n e c a n challenge
Election Committee's decision to ratify a post.
M r Julian Ranger's challenge did not meet
these criteria a c c o r d i n g to the R e t u r n i n g
Officer.
Collators
I should like to thank all my loyal, faithful
friends, whoever they may be, for putting this
edition together while I am out on the piss.
Further thanks to Paul Bailey for delivering
it.

Following the Rugby Club's victory in the

These teams have all represented the College
very favourably in these competitions and
should be heartily congratulated. Well done!
Keep up the good work.

Alternative Publicity
S o m e of y o u m a y h a v e s e e n p i l e s of
outrageous and scurrilous publicity around
e l e c t i o n time for " P o r k y " , " J . A n t i c h r i s t
Chipmunk", and " F E L I X Editor". After a quick
search in M r Steve Marshall's bin I discovered
scraps of paper which displayed scribbled
n o t e s f o r t h e s a i d s h e e t s in his own
handwriting. It's nice to see that Steve hasn't
lost his wonderful sense of timing and wit—he
even made it look as if one or two of the other
F E L I X staff did them. Tough luck s u c k e r -
caught!

Thanks to Ramzi, Nick, Peter, Steve, Martin,
Caroline, Soheel, Dave, Lesley, Mary, Jez, Izy
and all the collators.
Earlier this term I asked you to dissect an
obtuse angled triangle into the smallest
number of (strictly) acute angled triangles.
This week your task is to dissect a square into
the smallest possible number of acute angled
triangles — a much more difficult job!
Solutions, etc. to me at FELIX by
Wednesday 1:00 pm. £5 plus two tickets to the
IC Choir concert for the best entry.
Last week's winner was M . Begley, Maths 1.

Deaf Kiddies Party
O n Saturday, March 20, we are organising a
party for local deaf kiddies. H e l p e r s are
needed to organise food and play games. Y o u
don't need experience, just a bit of patience
when a deaf kiddie kicks your shins in and then
runs away knowing full well he can't hear the
stream of obscenities you hurl in his direction.
The party will be from 2:00 to 5:00pm.
Anyone who wants to help should come to the
next Rag meeting, Wednesday 17, 5:45pm,
Union Upper Lounge.
Rag Mag Editor
If you think you can produce a Rag M a g better
(or worse) than this year's, please see Mark
Smith very soon to see what this involves
(election at next Rag Meeting.
Calling Clubs and Societies
If you want a stall at the Rag Fete see me soon.
