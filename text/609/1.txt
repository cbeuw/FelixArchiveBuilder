ELECTION RE-RUN OFF
UGM decision overturned!
Cup double for IC
Saturday saw a unique double for IC Football, with the Firsts
and Seconds carrying off their respective cups on a dry, but
blustery day at Motspur Park. The College came close to
collecting all the three cups, but RSM II were narrowly
defeated in their final.
IC II began the day with a convincing 5-1 win against Q M C III,
putting them in 'high spirits' for the afternoon finale on the main
Motspur pitch. There, i n a hard, competitive match which, due to
nerves a n d the unfamiliar surroundings was memorable more for its
drama a n d excitement than its standard of football, I C I clinched
victory i n extra-time, having scored a l l the goals i n the 2-1 w i n .
Unfortunately, the occasion was slightly spoilt by crowd violence
instigated by a partisan (and exceedingly drunk) Goldsmith's following
which started at half-time and continued sporadically throughout the
rest of the afternoon. Indeed, the referee's concern was such that he
threatened to abandon the match, if the situation detiorated.
In direct contrast the vociferous I C support was directed to events on
the pitch, thus lifting the team to a well-deserved victory. (See sports
page for match reports.)

The Returning Officer for the sabbatical elections, Mr Marco
Ledwold, has decided that the decision taken at yesterday's
Results UGM to re-run the elections was ultra vires the
constitution.
This means the decision made by Election Committee at
midday yesterday to ratify the four elections still stands.
Those deemed elected are Mr Stephen Goulder as President,
Mr Philip Greenstreet as Deputy President, Miss Mary
Freeman as Honorary Secretary and Mr Martin S. Taylor as
Felix Editor.
M r Ledwold stated that the voting schedule clearly said that
Election Committee c a n ratify any election unless a valid objection is
lodged, as defined in the constitution. In this case the result must be
brought before a U G M . H o w e v e r the objection at yesterday's Results
U G M was constitutionally invalid, he said.
At the U G M M r L e d w o l d asked for objections to the i n d i v i d u a l
elections and after none were raised against Deputy President or
Honorary Secretary, the meeting voted not to approve the Presidential
Election alone on the grounds that the electorate were mislead b y a
sentence about abstentions in last week's F E L I X .
After a series of confusing speeches a n d proposals the current
President, M r Nick M o r t o n , explained that if one election was rejected
on a challenge to election procedure, then it applied equally to a l l of
them. Thus by rejecting one on these grounds the meeting was
rejecting them all.
M r M o r t o n then proposed a motion to ratify the entire election but
after opposition from Academic Affairs Officer M r M i k e Booty this was
defeated on the vote.
The meeting adjourned thinking that the election would be re-run,
but later the Returning Officer discovered that the decision was invalid
and hence a re-run would be ultra-vires the constitution. T h u s the
Election Committee decision to ratify a l l the elections still stands.
A n emergency U G M will be held on Thursday M a r c h 25 for the
hustings for the posts of External Affairs Officer, A c a d e m i c Affairs
Officer, Ents Officer and U G M C h a i r m a n , which were not held
yesterday.
S T O I C would like to apologise for a broadcast they made at 6 p m
yesterday announcing a re-run, as they were not informed of the latest
decision before the programme.
The full ramifications of this action are not known at the time of
going to press.
