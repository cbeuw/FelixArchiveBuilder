The King (David Dixon) imprisoned in The Tower in Brecht's Edward II.
Edward II by Bertolt Brecht (after
Marlowe). Presented by Foco Novo
Theatre Company and directed by Rees
at the Round House Theatre.
The Round House, London's unique Victorian
engine shed, built by Robert Louis Stephenson
in 1847, and which serves as a bold and
imaginative centre for theatre, visual arts,
music and dance, is the venue for Brecht's
Edward II. The play is one of Brecht's earliest,
coming soon after his first play Baal which was
presented by the B B C last week with
David Bowie in the title role. Baal was written
in an incredible four days when he was a
student of natural sciences at university.
Brecht re-examines M a r l o w e ' s story
(Marlowe was Shakespeare's most important
predecessor) and in place of dignified royal and
aristocratic figures he presents men of naked
and brutal ambition. Marlowe's chronicle is
turned into a ballad singer's chronicle play
which is swept along by rough, robust and
vigorous verse. The chronicle relates how
Edward (played by David Dixon), and his
homosexual infatuation with his 'favourite'
Gaveston, causes him to abandon his wife and
kingdom and take up arms with the barons.
The most fascinating character in the work is
Mortimer (played superbly by Ian Hogg).
Brecht electrifyingly transforms him from a

Nearly all great writers are boring. If you try
the big names like Dickens, Dostoevsky,
Tolstoy, Chekov, Kafka, Solzhenitsyn and so
on, youH find long stretches that are very
heavy going. (From the point of view of getting
recognition from the literary establishment,
being boring is probably an advantage for a
writer. Then the academics who decide to like
him can feel that they're a select few.)
But even the blurb on the cover is an under
statement when it comes to George Orwell.
He wasn't only a brilliant writer in the technical
sense, but he also took a completely different
approach from the one writers usually took in
the thirties and forties. That is, he didn't ignore
awkward facts and he tried to make his
opinions fit the facts rather than the other way
round. He didn't accept the widely held
doctrine that the end justifies the means, and
throughout his writings there's an atmosphere
of fair mindedness, a willingness to look at
both sides of the argument.
contemplative man of letters to a cunning man
of war who becomes instrumental in bringing
about the arrest, imprisonment and torture of
the King.
The Round House's production is tremen-
dously appealing to the senses. The coronation
of E d w a r d II in the o p e n i n g s c e n e is
accompanied by the swinging incense burners
and the mellifluous flow of a Gregorian chant.
The numerous brief interludes are filled with
the frenzied beating of drums which signal a
kind of relentless war-cry and in the enclosed
Orwell wasn't afraid to discuss awkward
questions (the conservation of the working
class, reprisals against German P o W s , the
show trials, etc.) no matter how frowned on it
was by the prevailing orthodoxy. What's more,
he spent a lot of his time attacking the Left,
even though he was himself a socialist,
because their conduct frequently disgusted
him; "....they think entirely in terms of power
politics and competitive prestige. In looking at
any situation they do not say 'What are the
facts? What are the probabilities?' but 'How
can I make it appear to myself and others that
my faction is getting the better of some rival
faction?'" This is the sort of writing that made
h i m u n p o p u l a r w i t h p e o p l e w h o w e r e
nominally his allies but whose outlook was
completely different.
Orwell wrote some of his most effective
work when he was trying to discredit the
t o t a l i t a r i a n ' r e a l i s t i c ' i n c l i n a t i o n s of the
intelligentsia but it has to be said that when he
tried making original, practical suggestions he
was sometimes pretty silly. "....(A) national
accent — a modification of cockney, perhaps,
or one of the northern accents — should be
taught as a matter of course to all children
alike."
About three quarters of this collection is
made up of the regular articles called 'As I
Please' which Orwell wrote for Tribune while
he was its literary editor. L e t t e r s , b o o k
reviews, articles for newspapers and some
long essays make up the rest. Apart from the
political essays there's an enormous range of
what you might call cultural pieces with
subjects going from how to make a perfect cup
of tea to the unattraetiveness of the U K as a
tourist r e s o r t . T h e style is a l w a y s v e r y
readable and clear and as the blurb says
George Orwell "possessed an unerring gift for
going straight to the point". This is one of the
best books in the English Language and 1 can't
recommend it (and the other three volumes,
and the rest ot Orwell's books) too highly.

A n o u t s t a n d i n g p r o d u c t i o n of one of
Brecht's earliest plays, with superlative acting,
it is if anything too short. One wishes one
could establish a little more emotional rapport
with the characters.

Playing the Game by Jeffrey Thomas.
Directed by Gruffudd Jones. ArtSi
Theatre.
The game is rugby of course, Welsh rugby at
club level. However, there is not a hooped
shirt, jockstrap or peculiar-shaped ball in sight.
Playing the Game, w r i t t e n by e m i g r a n t
Welshman Jeffrey Thomas, features not the
field, changing room and local hostelry, but the
b e d r o o m and club committee r o o m . T h e
subject matter is the sexual psychology and
power politics behind the scenes of the all-male
preserve of the rugby club.
The play is presented by the Theatr C l w y d
Comp. Wales' leading English language drama
c o m p a n y , w h i c h c e l e b r a t e d its s i x t i e t h
birthday on St. David's Day earlier this week.
T h e image of the r u g b y c l u b is of a
traditional organisation resistant to change,
epitomised by the men's fear and loathing for
women. Male weakness is shown in every
possible guise from repressed homosexuality
a n d i m p o t e n c e to c u c k o l d r y a n d o p e n
violence.
Martin Howells plays Kevin, the apparently
radical club treasurer who p r o p o s e s that
women be admitted to the clubhouse, whilst
c u n n i n g l y m a n i p u l a t i n g the rest of the
c o m m i t t e e ( c o m p r i s i n g R o r y H a l e a s
Secretary, Michael Hughes as Chairman, and
Christopher Barr as Captain) to his own ends,
by exploiting their naivety, weaknesses and
blunders.
Despite this total lack of any worthy male
attributes this is not a feminist play as such.
Women are represented by Arbel Jones as a
professional stripper, and the Chairman's wife
(played by Susie Johns) who has apparently
"had so many men through her that they were
thinking of naming a turnstile at Cardiff A r m s
Park after her."
I w o u l d r e c o m m e n d this play as light
entertainment for an evening out. Regardless
of the ticket discount for members of rugby
clubs, as well as students, it is not necessary to
understand or appreciate the game in order to
i enjoy this production, which continues until
early April.
