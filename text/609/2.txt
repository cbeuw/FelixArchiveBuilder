Dear Mark'
W h i l e I share G r a e m e
S h a w ' s d e t e s t a t i o n o f the
apartheid system, his call for a
total boycott of South African
products is unrealistic. T h e
unpleasant fact is that we are
totally dependant on South
Africa for essential minerals
l i k e t u n g s t e n , v a n a d i u m ,
gold, platinum, and heavily
dependant also for chrome,
n i c k l e a n d i n d u s t r i a l d i a -
monds. A total boycott of S.
African goods would mean no
light bulbs, masonry drills,
wedding rings, printed cir-
c u i t s , stainless steel, c a r
batteries, petrol a n d many
other industrial products. The
only alternative suppliers of
many essential minerals are in
the Soviet Bloc, and I don't
think much of their social
system either. I would support
a n u r g e n t p r o g r a m m e to
prospect a n d develop alter-
native free world supplies of
essential r a w materials we
currently import from South
Africa, but until that happens
t a l k o f a t o t a l b o y c o t t is
nonsense.
W e can in the meantime
concentrate o n improvements
that are possible, by pressing
British companies working in
South Africa to increase black
wage rates, open 'reserved'
occupations to black workers,
de-segregate works facilities,
and help black workers with
grants for house purchase and
the education of their chil-
dren. British companies in
South Africa are sensitive to
these issues and are moving to
counter the effects of apar-
theid as far as they can.
O f course this is not enough,
and we should support the
black South African's struggle
for p o l i t i c a l f r e e d o m b y
sporting and cultural boy-
cotts, and by discouraging
skilled tradesmen from emi-
grating to South Africa and
taking jobs that would other-
wise be made available to
blacks. B u t unless we are
prepared to wreck our eco-
nomy totally—and I don't
think any political party will
get a mandate for that—a call
for a total economic boycott is
an unrealistic gesture which
may ease some consciences,
but will do nothing to improve
the a c t u a l c o n d i t i o n s for
South African blacks.

Dear Sir
I am totally disgusted with
the way the cricket tour to
S o u t h A f r i c a h a s b e e n
handled. The South African
team is without doubt the best
in the world today and would
whip the arses oil" the West
I n d i a n s , a n d yet the B B C
refuses to televise the test
series.

appalled to lind that only one

national sport—football!
Sir
I would like to point out to
members of the H . G . Wells
S o c i e t y t h a t d u e to t h e
i n d u s t r i o u s efforts o f o u r
beloved leader, M r Pallab
Ghosh, a couple of deliberate
errors accidentally cropped
up in the new edition of The
Wellsian. T h e first was a
simple a n d unfortunate pre-
meditated oversight, in that
my name was somehow omit-
ted from the article. While I
totally deny all knowledge of
the f i n a l p a r a g r a p h , t h e
remainder was actually writ-
ten by me. The last paragraph
was just a n a d d e d bonus
which The Almighty, decided
to bestow upon us.
The second error was a
spelling mistake in the last
paragraph, in which the word
" s h i t " w a s f o r some y e t
u n e x p l a i n e d reason spelt
" c h a i r m a n " . ( P a l l a b was
awarded this sacred title some
two committee meetings ago.)
I realise of course that most
of our members worship M r
Ghosh on bended knees. In
extreme cases even giving up
food lor two weeks in order to
afford the £9 Wellsoc Dinner
just to hear his impending
speech, and the long awaited
"wide mouthed frog" joke.
T o these people I apologise,
however these things must be
said. It is, after all, a tradition
of student politics to insult
leading figures. With these
words I close.

PS: Pallab apologises for not
introducing Forbidden Planel-

Dear Mark
It has come to my notice
that two I C Union hacks have
been invited by the University
of L o n d o n President to a
U L U b o o z e - u p under the
pretence of a "reception for
Princess A n n e " .
M e m b e r s of the U n i o n
might be interested to know
that this is costing £1,000 of
their money, not much, but
i m a g i n e i f s i m i l a r l y irres-
ponsible people were elected
to run U L U next year.
Even the Chairman of IC
Labour Club, who will be
going along with I C U Presi-
dent Nick Morton, agreed it
was a waste of money, but he
said he didn't intend to do
a n y t h i n g about it because
" U L U piss-ups are ten times
better than anything at I C " .
I hope that F E L I X will in
future stop these two parasites,
who are totally unrepresenta-
tive o f I C students, from
having such a good time at
our expense.

Dear Sir
Couldn't 'caped crusaders'
and all other manner or form
of superhero be better engaged
i n s a v i n g t h e w o r l d o r ,
maybe, a mere 50m people
rather than writing cavalier
letters that can only harm the
worthwhile efforts of a few
who are prepared to do a lot
more than just talk?
