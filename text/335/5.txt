How I lost a week of my Easter
vac. and came to love the NUS.
ALASDHAIR CAMPBELL visits the NUS Conference
"Whoever y o u voted for, the exec got i n " read
the maxim on the bar wall at this year's Easter
NUS conference at Exeter. Once again the newly
elected NUS exec has the usual preponderance of
Communist Party members and fellow travellers,
with a smattering of IS and right wingers.
The elections were free to Icve w h o m one
fought on four slates:
the C P , w h o rejected
J o h n R a n d a l l , w h o w a s
elected as President,
standing as an indepen-
dent; the International
S o c i a l i s t s "alternative
l e f t " slate; the I M G
w h o ran on a slate
taken from their I M G
G r a n t s Broadsheet
partly written by Piers
C o r b y n ; a n d the Y o u n g
Socialists w h o , stand-
ing f o r the first time this
year, pressed home the
need to force the Tories
to resign a n d return a
L a b o u r government
pledged to socialist
policies.
The statements on
Stirling made by the
C P , a n d allegations of
sell out over the grants
c a m p a i g n due to lack of
organization, gave the
C P slate a tough time
in hustings, but this w a s
chickenfeed compared
to the uproar that broke
out whenever a Y S can-
didate spoke. T h e u n -
holy d i n of barks a n d
shouts that greeted
t h e m so unnerved Digby
J a c k s , w h o w a s chair-
ing at the time, to
prompt h i m , in an effort
to quell the hecklers, to
reveal his innermost
thoughts on the func-
tion of N U S : " T h i s is
not a political m e e t i n g "
he shouted.
The results for the
major executive p o s i -
tions are as follows:
President:
J o h n Randall
Dep. President:
Stuart Paul
Treasurer:
Jeff Staniforth
Secretary:
Steve Parry
The first motion to
the conference w a s one
on gay rights a n d the
ending of d i s c r i m i n a t i o n
against gay socs. There
was a predictable
speech for: 'In this day
and age one should be
w i s h e s . . . break away
from V i c t o r i a n sexual
moves . . . 1 in 2 0
people are homosexual
. . . ' Then surprisingly
s o m e o n e rose to speak
against: 'These people
are disgusting perverts
. . . a n i m a l s in the sight
of G o d . . . the horrible
result of the degenera-
tion of moral values . . .'
He got d o w n from the
microphone, w e n t
across a n d k i s s e d his
boyfriend. A l l these
s p e e c h e s , for or
In short these propo-
sale were c o n d e m n e d
by conference a n d seen
against, were being
made by G a y Lib guys.
This passed, the antics
were over (for the m o -
ment) a n d the confer-
ence turned to the poli-
tical meat of s e s s i o n :
the motions o n grants,
union autonomy a n d the
W h i t e Paper.
Autonomy
After the s u c c e s s of
the c a m p a i g n against
the government green
paper attack on union
autonomy a n d the ensu-
ing bill proposed by G i l -
bert Longden, the m o -
tion a n d amendments
passed were to step up
the autonomy campaign
and direct it paticularly
towards those colleges
with little or no auton-
omy. N U S executive
was also directed to lay
contingency plans in
preparation for further
attacks. T h e conference
also urged a l l constitu-
ent organisations to re^
linquish charitable sta-
tus for their unions as
it held them back politi-
cally a n d gave them no
benefit other than the
dubious privilege of not
paying tax on invest-
ments.
Despite a spirited
speech attacking the
Labour party made by
Sonia Hochfelder, N U S
will still try to elicit
promises from the Lab-
our leadership that it
will remove any legal
restrictions on S U aut-
onomy.
White Paper
The government W h i t e
Paper on Education titled
in the same vein as their
" F a i r " Rents A c t , called
Education: A Framework
for " E x p a n s i o n " shower-
ed proposals for cut-
backs in all spheres of
education upon a morti-
fied a c a d e m i c w o r l d : —
A decrease in the ex-
penditure allotted to
education, in the n u m -
ber of places in higher
education a n d in teacher
supply. Not nearly en-
ough money will be giv-
en to nursery education,
and moreover that the
boost in this sphere w i l l
be offset by a correspon-
ing decrease in finance
for higher education.
The money allocated to
new buildings is not even
enough to cover the cost
of replacing a l l the pre-
1 9 0 0 schools in the
I L E A ' S alone. T h e Paper
makes no mention of the
Development of compre-
hensive education, of
welfare a n d counsellnig
in schools or of the need
for provisions for i m m i -
grant children. It sug-
gests real cut-backs in
teacher pay.
In short these propos-
als were c o n d e m n e d
by conference a n d seen
in the light of (a) an
e c o m o n i c a l l y hard-pres-
sed government being
forced to c u t back in the
field of social services,
(b) that a l l rationalisa-
tions made because of
(a) were, to discriminate
against the working
class a n d in particular
the lower paid, a n d in
favour of areas of high
profitability v i z : the
boost in polys of indus-
try based courses.
Piers Corbyn propos-
ed an a m e n d m e n t tying
the grants c a m p a i g n a n d
the proposed anti-White
Paper campaign togeth-
er, he got a standing
ovation from the hall
a n d the N U S executive,
and w a s carried s h o u l d -
er high d o w n the centre
of the hall to cheers a n d
claps. T h e speech
against w a s hissed a n d
booed a n d Trevor Phil-
lips gave a vote of thanks
for Piers' long service
for N U S . A g a i n Piers
was carried shoulder
high round the hall a n d
placed in the chairman's
chair to shouts of
" s p e e c h ! "
Life m e m b e r s h i p of
N U S for Piers w a s pro-
posed to cheers a n d c o n -
veniently forgotten by
the N U S exec. There
w a s a proposal to take
Piers in parts instead of
the motion, to buy h i m
a n e w purple jumper, to
auction his o l d one f o r
N U P E a n d a c o n d e m n a -
tion by Burke, resident
c o m e d i a n a n d inveterate
piss-artist, of that con-
ference's silliness. Des-
pite such a display of
warmth to Piers the m a n ,
conference s h o w e d its
dislike for Piers the poli-
tician a n d voted the
amendment out.
Grants
The original motion,
tabled by N U S exec
and others, w a s a m e n d -
ed in only two spheres
— a n y attempt to link
grants campaign with the
present struggles against
the w a g e s a n d prices
policies of the govern-
ment w a s hotly opposed
by the executive a n d the
right w i n g and voted out.
A n a m e n d m e n t con-
demning the lack of ac-
tion by the N U S over dis-
cretionary awards a n d
stating that the N U S
should not accept any
settlement on mandatory
awards until the discre-
tionary a w a r d s system
was abolished, w a s nar-
rowly carried on a test
vote but a card vote w a s
still pressed for. Later
on before the result w a s
announced there w a s an
attempt to suspend
standing order 5 7 , w h i c h
permits a revote, but this
w a s defeated a n d then
the reason for this at-
tempt became apparent.
The amendment had
been passed by the card
vote but before the con-
ference h a d fully reas-
sembled, the result had
been illegally announced
by a n exec fellow travel-
ler, in an attempt to
rouse support for a re-
vote. M e m b e r s of the
exec h a d also been go-
ing round the conference
urging people to vote
against the amendment
in the revote. T h e C P
w o u l d try any trick in
the book rather than a c -
cept defeat, but they got
their just return in the
revote w h e r e they w e r e
overwhelmingly defeat-
ed, a n d the amendment
w a s carried.
The other defeat for
the C P w a s over their
proposals for the intro-
duction of a student
w a g e rather than the
grants system. A n a m -
endment to censure the
exec for ignoring a
mandate from Margate
'72 a n d not c i r c u l a -
ting a document on stu-
dent wage in time to
allow d i s c u s s i o n before
the voting at the Exeter
conference, w a s not
passed. The Exec w a s
mandated not to press
for a student w a g e ,
though only on the some-
what w o o l l y grounds
that conference believes
that the majority of
N U S does not want a
wage.
Replying to a propos-
al censuring the exec for
their anachronistic pro-
test politics approach to
the grants campaign,
J o h n Lane observed:
" H o w m a n y censures of
the exec must w e have
before the Tory govern-
ment r e s i g n s ? "
A n amendment w a s
passed for the holding
of a special N U S confer-
ence s h o u l d a govern-
ment offer be made, a n d
this w o u l d be paid for
by the larger colleges so
as not to discriminate
agaist the smaller, a n d
therefore poorer, ones.
The debate on the
substantive (amended)
motion w a s opened b y
Dusty M i l l e r of the Y . S .
He s l a m m e d the unreal-
ity of the protest ap-
proach to the grants
campaign in view of the
current e c o n o m i c crisis.
He quoted the Evening
Standard W a l l Street
correspondent w h o said
that there is the m o o d of
an impending W a l l St.
crash in A m e r i c a a n d
quotes one b i g financier
as saying that this " w i l l
make the depression of
the 1 9 3 0 ' s look like a
s u m m e r f e s t i v a l " .
The s u m m i n g up by
John Randall to boos a n d
hisses as he w a s an
exec member a n d a
speech from the floor
had been requested, de-
nounced the idea of the
crisis a n d stated that
w e must continue the
grants c a m p a i g n until
our d e m a n d s are met.
The motion w a s pas-
sed.
M i s c e l l a n y
Throughout the con-
ference posters appear-
ed attacking the N U S
sell out in Larbet T e c h .
Various speakers pur-
ported to c o m e from
Larbet T e c h . But what
and w h e r e w a s Larbet
T e c h , a n d w h y w a s
Burke, suspect w h e n i n -
olved in anything, sup-
porting it? A l l w a s re-
vealed in a speech from
Lachie C a m p b e l l w h o
c l a i m e d to c o m e from
Larbet T e c h . This speech
began in gaelic with a
few English w o r d s , re-
cognisable amongst the
flow of prehistoric gut-
tural, like " s t r u g g l e " ,
" s e l l - o u t " " g a s - c h a m -
b e r s " a n d ended being
a condemnation of the
lack of N U S concern
with the smaller colleg-
es in their fights against
discretionary awards
and non-mandatory u n -
ion membership.
C o m m e n t
The fact that the C P
and the right w i n g con-
sistently voted against
any attempt to link the
three main motions on
grants, union autonomy,
and the White Paper to-
gether in anlysis a n d
action, is b l i n d a n d de-
plorable as it c a n only
divide a n d m i s l e a d the
student body. That these
attacks on students, on
their living standards,
and on their ability to
organise, are not seen
by the C P a n d the right
w i n g as part of the gen-
eral attacks on the living
standards a n d the ability
to organise of the work-
ing class made by the
Tory government with
their Phase II a n d Indus-
trial Relations A c t s , is
dangerous a n d divisive
of the student body for
these are c o m m o n strug-
gles against a c o m m o n
enemy. T h i r d l y the fact
that these attacks are
only explainable in terms
of the present e c o n o m i c
crisis in the capitalist
w o r l d , whose short-term
resolution necessitates a
smashing of the living
standards, a n d therefore
organisations, of the
w o r k i n g class, means
that the only effective ac-
tion for the student
body must have that
perspective.
Moreover the C P ,
I M G a n d IS candidates
joined w i t h Burke a n d
Proctor in making jibes
at the Y S candidates
during the elections for
the Executive C o m m i t -
tee M e m b e r s a n d this
led to the election of
those two worker bash-
er right wingers. A t the
Margate conference they
both resigned as soon as
they were elected, but
the inclusion of right
w i n g politics into their
otherwise irrelevent a n d
irreverent speeches at
Exeter this year made it
obvious that this time
they were out to get
more than laughs. They
d i d not resign.
To misquote J o h n
Lane: H o w many cen-
sures of the exec w i l l
the student body make
before it wakes up, k i c k s
them out a n d re-elects a
leadership that will fight
in its interests? It is
clear from the efforts of
the C P to thwart the " n o
mandatory award deals
until the discretionary
awards system is abol-
i s h e d " proposed at Exe-
ter that no holds will be
barred to reverse that
amendment in their e m -
ergency conference call-
ed m i d J u n e as it is a
distinct embarrassment
to a party w h i c h consis-
tently a v o i d s putting the
political questions to the
students a n d workers it
c l a i m s to represent.
