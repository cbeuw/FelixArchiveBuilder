Election Result leaked within hours of
count
Sayles gets biggest ever Presidential vote
FELIX R E P O R T E R
N O R M A N S A Y L E S and P A U L WADS-
W O R T H were the successful candidates in
last week's elections for President and Sec-
retary, according to informed sources. These
sources had spread the news throughout the
college within a few hours of the count finish-
ing on Thursday morning, although there is
a theoretical embargo on the result until the
election procedure has been ratified by Thurs-
day's Union General Meeting.
Norman had a landslide victory over R o b
Armitage and Jock Veall, gaining the highest
vote ever achieved by a Presidential candi-
date. He scored about 850, against Jock
Veall's 170 and R o b Armitage's 120, and was
elected on the first count.
Paul Wadsworth had a present at the count, some
close battle with Gordon of them observing on be-
sident and Secretary on a
poll well i n excess of the
25 per cent minimum ne-
cessary for the election to
valid. It was the fourth
— and last — election for
President this academic
year. Pundits were stun-
ned by the high turnout:
over 700 voted on the first
day alone, 200 more than
voted on both days of the
last election.
Unlike their counter-
parts in many other U n i -
versity Unions, the new
President and Secretary
can by no means be ac-
cused of perpetuating a n
executive chair. N o r m a n
Sayles has until n o w been
only a secondary figure
on Union Council, on
which he has represented
the Botany and Zoology
departments for two
years. Paul Wadsworth,
although prominent
through his phenomenally
successful handling of
Ents this year, certainly
does not see eye to eye
with the current execu-
tive.
The election has to be
ratified by Thursday's
U G M . This U G M , which
will be (as usual) at 1
p.m. in the Great H a l l , is
also responsible for elect-
ing six floor representa-
tives to Council, the U n i -
versity of London U n i o n
representative, two mem-
bers of the Accommoda-
tion Committee and three
members of the Welfare
Committee. Another mot-
ion on grants is bound to
come before the meeting
in view of the N U S 21st
Deadline.
Jackson for the Secretary
ship, and it took until the
final count before he
achieved the quota. T h e
other contender, Peter
Gillet, gained a creditable
150 votes on the first
count, compared with the
others' three or four hun-
dred each.
The election result,
which should not even be
appearing in this issue of
F E L I X if U n i o n Secre-
tary M a r t i n Black is to be
believed, was already wid-
ely known i n the College
only hours after the count
finished o n Thursday
morning. T h e information
was leaked by people
half of candidates, and
the fact that the news
spread so fast proves how
naive the idea of keeping
the result secret until the
election procedure is rati-
fied is.
The Sayles/Wadsworth
victory can only be seen
as a victory for the "mod-
erates". T h e forthcoming
regime is already being
likened by prominent
Union officials as a re-
turn to the H o b m a n /
M c C u l l o u g h days, sur-
prisingly only a year
away. This feeling was
only second to that of
profound relief at suc-
ceeding in electing a Pre-
Editorial
After a year of political chaos, ICU is back
in business. No one can pretend that, with a
one-way-minded political President and a bur-
eaucracy fetishist as Secretary the Union has
actually achieved anything this year, apart from
severely tarnishing its credibility.
The new executive is going to have to work
hard, harder than any previous executive, to re-
gain this credibility.
Their first problem will be getting people to
Union Meetings. Union Meetings run the Union,
but inquorate or unrepresentative ones run them
to pot.
U G M s will have to be made more relevant
to the ordinary student. Okay, grants motions
are relevant—but pledging support to earth-
worms suffering under the policies of a wicked
revisionist government isn't (at least, not in the
first analysis). And petty squabbles between the
IMG, CPGB, CPB(M-L), Y S S S , et al, certainly
aren't.
Agricultural methods will have to be taken
to U G M motions. And it mustn't end with whole-
sale weeding. The roots need protecting against
rot and attack.
We must welcome the new executive. They
know what they have to do. FELIX will be keep-
ing its microscope on them next year to make
sure they do it. But we won't cast any aspersions
on them before they start.
Good luck to them.
Oh and thank you if you voted. I hope you're
happy too.
