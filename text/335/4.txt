Trevor Phillips, next year's External Affairs
Officer, argues
"It's time for a
complete facelift"
Several times in the past two terms, the Union
leadership has been under fire for failing to propose
acceptable policy o n crucial issues. In reply, the E x -
ecutive has [jointed to apathy, left-wing extremism,
right-wing reaction a n d stifling bureaucracy. Accusa-
tions have been tossed about, resulting in the gradual
loss of credibility, which the Union has suffered re-
cently.
To reverse this loss, we must identify the areas of
our failure correctly. Without doubt, the major short-
fall has been the consistent failure of I C U either to
discuss or to take action on external issues. Is this be-
cause students do not believe that they should respond
to the questions of Student Finance, Government Pol-
icy on Education, challenges to Union Autonomy or
racism in Southern Africa? I hardly think so.
A possible cause of the
aparent disinterest is that
the majority of students
are poorly informed as to
the implications and con-
sequences of these issues
on their own lives. This
should he the task of the
External Affairs Commit-
tee, but any member of
the E A C will tell you that
in its' present form it is
impossible for the E A C to
fulfil its proper role of
adviser to the Union. The
small and poorly attended
E A C meetings have no
hope of ever fulfilling their
constitutional mandate,
because of the number of
issues and organisations
which are now the respon-
sibility of the E A C .
Viewing the situation i n
this Bight indicates that
one way to combat disin-
terest and apathy i n the
Union is to expand and
somehow re-structure the
E A C . The expanded body
would be able to involve
more members of the U n -
ion i n policy making and
provide a better flow of
information to the U G M .
In this way we can ex-
pand the circle of debate
both in terms of the num-
ber of subjects under de-
bate and the number of
people involved.
The greater the number
of people that is involved
in the decision-making
process, ie the more in
U n i o n meetings and com-
mittee meetings, the more
people will be involved in
the action taken, A resur-
gence in interest in the
U n i o n would give a boost
to election campaigns, and
perhaps U n i o n Officers
would be elected on their
stands on the issues rather
than on their personal ap-
peal.
F r o m the point of view
of the External Affairs
Officer a change would be
welcome; at present, he
has little chance of keep-
ing a l l his areas of respon-
sibility under control. The
Union's attitudes are too
often determined by a
committee of one or two,
simply because E A O is
unable to handle the vol-
ume of work handed to
him to channel through
Council or a U G M . H e is
not a sabbatical officer.
The proposed structure a l -
lows for the duties of the
E A O and E A C to be han-
dled more efficiently than
under the present struc-
ture.
The Groups
The basis of the new
structure requires setting
up a number of fact-find-
ing and policy-making
" G r o u p s " . These would
be composed in such a
way that the groundwork
on a specific area of ex-
ternal policy would be
laid by people with re-
sponsibilities or interests
in this area. For example,
the Academic Affairs
Officers would be asked
to help form an Educa-
tional Policy Group.
The groups would be
semi autonomous bodies,
but would report to the
External Affairs Board.
The Board
The composition of the
Board would be similar to
that of the E A C , but
would be expanded to in-
clude the Chairman of
each Group, two reps
from- publicity, and cam-
paign committee and the
Editor of the External
Affairs Newsheet.
The Groups would, es-
sentially, be the generators
of the Union policy, but
the Board would compose
motions or finalise reports
to be presented to the
U G M . The Publicity and
Campaign Committee is
envisaged as fulfilling two.
functions: i) publicise the
issue before the U G M , and
ii) make campaign pro-
posals to the Board.
Generally, the E A O or
the relevant G r o u p Chair-
man would be responsible
for presenting the policy
submission to the U G M ,
along with the campaign
proposals.
This is less complicated
than it seems. Submissions
from the Groups would
probably be passed
through the E A B virtu-
ally unchanged. Where
two opposing positions
arose,. the differences
would be stated in pre-
U G M publicity and the
debate conducted at the
U G M .
A n y campaign proposals
passed at U G M wouid be
the responsibility of the
Executive, of course, but
it is hoped that the Pub-
licity and Campaign com-
mittee would assist the
Executive in initiating
and maintaining action on
the issues.
Responsibilities
The Chairman of each
G r o u p would be elected
by the G r o u p and ap-
proved by U G M . H e
would be responsible for
drawing up a n agenda,
and convening the group,
in consultation with the
E A O . H e would represent
the G r o u p on the E A B .
The E A O , N U S Secre-
tary and a representative
from the P and C C o m -
mittee would automatically
be members of each
group. Interested Union
members should feel free
to join the Groups at any-
time.
Several Groups have
been identified tentatively.
i) Educational Policy
This G r o u p would con-
sider issues such as White
Paper and Murray. Hope-
fully, it would take on
the task of considering
the role of I C in educa-
tion, science education i n
general, the relationships
between education and in-
dustry and employment
prospects.
This G r o u p would not
be set up to clash with"
Academic Affairs. It
would consider far wider
questions than A A C does,
and would be complemen-
tary to A A C . In fact, it
would be desirable for the
Academic Affairs Officers,
along with the P G Affairs
Officer to be in this group,
or send representatives.
ii) International Policy
The terms of reference
here are- quite obvious.
M y hope is to have this
committee mainly com-
posed of representatives of
the International clubs,
along with one each from
Overseas Students C o m -
mittee, A A M , and Third
World First. Clearly, for-
mation of a G r o u p like
this would be a way to
bring overseas students in-
terests into the Union, and
to resucitate international
issues like South Africa,
the Middle East and
Greece.
iii) Labour Policy
This Group would mon-
itor and try to improve
communications between
the Labour Movement and
the Student Movement
It would be an effective
method of liaising with
the College's Trade U n -
ions, representatives of
which should make up
half the Group.
Other Groups which
have been suggested are
Environment and C o n -
servation, and one to deal
with the related areas of
Women's Liberation, G a y
Liberation, abortion and
contraception.
A structure such as the
one proposed could re-
move the inevitable slop-
piness which characterises
E A C activities at present.
Policy could be properly
thought out and dissemi-
nated. This would prob-
ably make U n i o n policy
more acceptable to the
membership.
M a n y campaigns could
be sustained, even though
general attention might be
focused elsewhere. A
mechanism would exist
whereby on-going cam-
paigns such as South A f -
rica, Greece, Conserva-
tion and C H E would be
continued at a low level.
This is preferable to spor-
adic efforts by tiny groups
to interest the rest of the
union. These campaigns
can be maintained if
people with specific inter-
ests a n d responsibilities
normally centred outside
the U n i o n structure can
work within a n expanded
Union, over which they
have greater control. T h e
membership would be
able to use the Union's
democratic process and
general facilities to much
greater advantage.
M o r e people would be
involved i n the decision-
making of the U n i o n . Per-
haps this would go some
way to eliminating the
spectre of a n undemo-
cratic a n d unrepresenta-
tive U n i o n .
In m y campaign for
E A O , I promised to work
for what I saw as nec-
cessary to the Union, a
better flow of information
to the membership, a
newsheet, more effective
decision and policy-mak-
ing and greater opportun-
ity for the membership to
involve itself i n the
Union's activities on speci-
fic issues. This plan lays
the basis for all these
promises to be fulfilled.
T o make this succeed
will take time a n d hard
work; but this is the op-
portunity for people who
complain that things
aren't r u n properly, that
they are being shut out,
to take a hand and
accomplish things.
This is simply a blue-
print; details still have to
tant that discussions take
be sorted out. It is impor-
place i n the next few
weeks, so that by mid-
term the Constitutional
changes can be drawn up.
A n y comments are wel-
come, particularly i n the
columns of Felix; let's kick
it around and get it right.
The more criticism and
discussion the better.
