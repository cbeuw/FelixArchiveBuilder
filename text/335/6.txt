Sir,
The article in the last issue
of Felix "Praise the Lord and
pass the profits", by Mr. Jock
Veall is one on which he
must be congratulated. He
has explained in very vivid
terms and probably therefore
with greater efficiency than
I, the point I tried hard to
make in my series of letters
to Felix last term.
The case he puts forward
is harsh and overemphasised
but makes it quite clear that
we can not automatically
equate the terms "Church"
(in the popular sense) with
"Christians" (in the Biblical
sense). It is probably a good
analogy to explain this if I
say that just because current
Labour Party policy is rather
wishy-washy it docs not in
itself invalidate Marx's thesis
of what we now know as
Marxism.
In the Bible, Jesus, whom
I willingly concede was
neither black nor white, but
probably the colour of a
modern day Palestinian Arab
I if it really matters), had
strong views on people who
practised piety and religion
which was, in effect, merely
a pastime and nothing to do
with either God or living.
So, we have the happy
situation where Mr. Veall
agrees wholeheartedly on at
least one point with Jesus
Christ, On the other hand we
have an evolved situation
where many so-called reli-
gious people have fallen into
the trap of becoming 're-
spectable'. When we look at
the early Christians and es-
pecially when we look at
Jesus how incongruous this
picture is. Jesus was a dis-
tinctly anti-establishment fig-
ure but His motives were
always moral and his life was
a living example of His teach-
ing.
Having said this, I must
make it quite clear that just
because someone belongs to
a denomination which has
investments in S. Africa this
does not automatically label
him a hypocrite, for I am con-
fident that most church-goers
have never been consulted as
to where church funds should
be invested.
What conclusions should
we therefore draw from this
issue?
Firstly let us all discard
this "Less bourgeois than
thou" attitude and truthfully
decide if in the Bible v/e find
anywhere instructions to
oppress our brothers and
sisters, look particularly at
the Epistle of James, if after
this we comb to the honest
(important word that) opinion
that Jesus is responsible for
the way we (and here I mean
all of us) oppress our fellow
men then by all means do
not become a Christian, but
if you find that Jesus, the
risen saviour, demands love,
service, compassion and truth
and also promises to provide
the strength for this task by
means of the Holy Spirit, then
read God's word, and ask
Him to show Himself to you,
you will not be disappointed,
because Jesus is alive today,
I've mot Him, many people
have met Him and maybe
you, the reader, if you aban-
don the pride which we all
have against being told how
to run our lives by God, and
look to Jesus you too will
meet Him.
To Mr. Veall I say only
this: Think hard, think very
hard because Jesus Christ
loves you. .
Yours in Christ,
MAURICE MOLONEY.

Sir,
With reference to your
front page comments about
the last presidential (sick!)
elections we would like to
make the following observa-
tions: •
Firstly, in an election, it is
the person one votes for, not
the amount of campaigning a
person does. The amount of
campaigning ROY MATT-
HEWS did is irrelevant. The
number of votes Roy received
without campaigning is indi-
cative of the high esteem in
which he is held in the col-
lege. We'll let you draw
your own conclusions about
Rob Armitage,
Secondly, let us consider
the qualifications of each per-
son. Rob Armitage has, it is
true, been Rag Chairman and
External Affairs Officer, both
of which are good recommen-
dations, but on the other
hand, Roy Matthews has been
Hon. Sec. of I.C.R.U.F.C.,
President of the Stoats Club
and Vice - C a p t a i n of
I.C.R.U.F.C. Both clubs have
run very smoothly indeed
under his able administration,
which is more than can be
said of the Union.
Thirdly it should be noted
that Roy did in fact try to
withdraw from the elections
beforehand, but was pre-
vented from doing so by MCB
who said that as his name
was already on the ballot
paper, the nomination should
stand.
Finally we ourselves are
very thankful to Roy for pre-
venting Rob Armitage be-
coming Hon. Sec. Who could
follow MCB anyway? Perhaps
he won't become President
either. What a crying shame.
Yours nastily,

Question
please
Sir,
As those who attended the
hustings will know, a ques-
tion I had written out, to be
put to all candidates, and
which was the second ques-
tion handed to P. Jowitt was
not asked. At the end of the
meeting I found it at the bot-
tom of the pile of questions,
and P. Jowitt seems to be in
some doubt as to why this
occurred.
The question was, "Do the
candidates for President of
l.C.U. believe that the person
elected should be indepen-
dent of this year's Union
Bureaucracy, in view of its
poor record. For instance,
one of the candidates is a
member of the Welfare com-
mittee, but has attended at
most one committee meet-
ing" (the one exception being
when my informant did not
attend which I am not sure
about.) This person is of
course 'Norm Sayles' your
lovable Bot/Zoo Dept. Rep.
Paul Jowitt told me after-
wards that he saw me write
the question, then go and tell
Jock Veall what it was, so he
showed all the candidates the
question. Besides being a lie,
if they all knew about it,
why wasn't it asked? Another
answer he gave was that he
just put it down on the table,
and that he didn't read the
questions out, so I should
blame John Lane. John Lane
didn't put the questions in
order!
Yours, with little faith of it

"ft R F F P '
It is a sobering thought that Imperial College is
very likely to have a new Rector before it comes
round to finally elect a new Union President. Sir
Brian Flowers, who takes over from Penney at the
start of the next college year, comes here with a
hard reputation for a resilience of purpose which
should be well-tested by the massed ranks of
clamouring apathy carving their initials on his Geor-
gian shutters on the Queen's Gate Rectorpad.
To my mind knighthoods are a splendid embell-
ishment of our great society. If you push and bully
and pressurise enough and tread on enough people's
heads then the system invites y o u to make pots of
money and become a power-crazed. Rolls chauff-
eured alcoholic and then . . . . a knight. Hastily add-
ing — s o Felix c a n appear at least o n c e with new
cat a n d masthead (but look what happened to the
Daily Express w h e n it changed its masthead) —
that I don't imagine for one moment that Sir Brian
fits into this category of industrial S e l s d o n m a n . But
d o all the rich S i r Gilberts of this world really give
all that service for export or productivity or tech-
nological innovation out of altruism?
W h a t other categories of knighthood are offered?
T o the public relations m a n , the diplomat whose
sweet s m i l e carries through every controversy with
an air of surreal detachment, faith in the present a n d
boundless hope for the future. T h e m a n w h o swims
on as all around h i m flounder in the sea of perpe-
tual crisis. S u c h a m a n is S i r Victor M o o n e y .
T o the m a n of letters, the man w h o , above all
others has a masterful c o m m a n d of the English
spoken w o r d . H o w about Sir M i c h a e l Doherty —
although he does s o u n d like s o m e o n e from the Irish
equivalent of the C B I .
A n d back to the elections, to the m a n of persist-
ence a n d endeavour, Rob Armitage, your friendly
candidate a n d surely, for all that money he's made,
another knighthood to Paul Wadsworth. A strange
socety indeed.
Well, my currently blank mind (it's obvious, isn't
it?) has prompted me to team up with dogmatism so
I'm forming a bible study group. Anyone wishing to
be interviewed with a view to joining this select
band of apostles should get in touch with my secre-
tary:
The very Reverend Sir J o c e l y n Veall,
c / o The Festival of Light,
Gangwank Street, S W 7 .
Don't fo get to vote today a n d remember, next
time you step foot into the hallowed reaches of
Southside Mooney, the words of Genesis: " T h o u
shalt not eat of anything that eateth of itself." M a y
