OLIVER DOWSON VISITS
THE N.U.S.S. CONFERENCE
W h e n I was at infant school, more
years ago than I really care to re-
member, we used to play games imi-
tating our elders, like ' M o t h e r s and
Fathers'. We spend most of the time
squabbling, as only c h i l d r e n can
squabble, over all sorts of trivialities,
like who was going to say what when.
Of course, by the time we got our-
selves sorted out the bell went for
the end of the break and we had to
get back to our three Rs.
I a m prompted to these reminisc-
ences by m y reGent attendance at the
annual conference of the National
U n i o n of S c h o o l Students, h e l d in
early M a y at City University, Lon-
don. The conference w a s indeed just
like one of these games, the o n l y real
difference being that the children
playing the games were aged be-
tween 14 a n d 1 9 , instead of be-
tween 4 a n d 7. A n d I cannot help but
think that w e made a more creditable
imitation of our parents When in the
kindergarten than these teenyboppers
make of their peers of a mere year
or t w o .
It is not my intention to decry the
aims a n d objects of the N U S , but it
w o u l d exceed dishonesty on m y part
to tell y o u that their conference suc-
ceeded in achieving anything other
than electing a new executive. I have
previously, o n o c c a s i o n , been given
to the belief that N U S conferences
could b e the height of bureaucratic
inefficiency. I w i t h d r a w a l l such alle-
gations n o w .
T h e conference started eighty min-
utes late w i t h a brief rallying call
from retiring President B o b Leeson,
speedily followed b y a first-rate de-
monstration of w r a n g l i n g from the
steering committee, w h i c h consisted
of two people who disagreed w i t h
each other over everything. A n e w
amendment to the standing order
says that "all meetings except the
National Conference shall be held in
as informal a manner as p o s s i b l e " . It
w o u l d be difficult to be less formal
than a National Conference, a n d may-
be for that reason I a m not anticipat-
ing attending any area meetings (they
probably w o n ' t invite m e , anyway).
But I shall bore y o u if I continue in
this vein. Y o u should have already
gathered an impression of the style of
operation of the conference. But con-
ference d i d succeed o n at least one
occasion in sitting d o w n like g o o d
children a n d listening to teacher. The
occasion in m i n d w a s an address from
a fraternal speaker from French
school students. They are a little bet-
ter organised over there: indeed, they
managed to get 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 scholars out
on the streets on t w o days recently,
protesting against " L a Loi D e b r e " ,
w h i c h w o u l d have forced F r e n c h
scholars to take their year's national
service between the ages of 1 8 a n d
2 1 — t h u s disrupting their further e d u -
cation. They have achieved a victory
albeit with reservations, in having this
law suspended.
Similar shows of strength of school
students have c o m e in B e l g i u m , Lux-
embourg a n d Germany. In Britain it
may b e a lot more difficult. There are
in excess of 2 m i l l i o n scholars aged
12-18, so the movement has a long
way to go. 1 0 , 0 0 0 o f them are m e m -
bers of the N U S S a n d pay 2 0 p or
30p membership each year.
T o qualify as a branch, a school
need only have four members of the
N U S S a n d (25 per cent of these con-
stitute a quorum!) I asked the leader
of the branch at my home town, Low-
estoft's Denes High S c h o o l about the
recruitment situation. I should point
out that amidst the East A n g l i a n sea
of apathy, Lowestoft is an oasis of
involvement a n d enthusiasm. Never-
theless, he told m e that h e h a d s o
far only recruited five members from
his school (which has a thousand
students). H e laid s o m e of the blame
w i t h N U S S h e a d office, w h o h a d tak-
en seven w e e k s to send h i m a supply
of m e m b e r s h i p cards, a n d also on the
fact that it w a s n o w the s u m m e r term
and membership taken out n o w w o u l d
only b e current for three months; but,
he s a i d , most students were prepared
to co-operate w i t h the a u t h o r i t i e s —
at least to some e x t e n t — a n d w e r e
thus not interested in joining a move-
ment that is openly discouraged by
the staff.
Lowestoft w o u l d seem to be a fair-
ly typical branch. Outside L o n d o n ,
the N U S S movement has only tiny
pockets o f membership in places such
as Lowestoft except for a notably
high number in S c o t l a n d . O b v i o u s l y
they rely o n getting some really i n -
volved people in every part of the
country w h o w i l l spread the w o r d —
and the membership c a r d s — a r o u n d .
B o b Leeson said in h i s opening a d -
dress that the c o m i n g year w o u l d
make o r break the N U S S , a n d this
point w a s echoed by the candidates
for this year's executive. It is obvious-
ly going to be an uphill struggle to
maintain a n d increase membership.
Unlike the N U S they rely on m e m -
bers actually p h y s i c a l l y joining a n d
paying their membership fees. If a n d
w h e n they gain a membership of con-
siderable size they c o u l d thus reason-
ably c l a i m to be stronger than their
parent union, since all their members
have chosen to join.
H o w are they then to recuit m e m -
bership? A n d , more difficult still, h o w
are they to maintain it? M r . Leeson
suggests that holding a campaign is
the only w a y , a n d delegates agreed.
The question is more one of finding
a campaign that school students
will feel strongly enough about to
mobilise on a signficant scale. T h e
only d e m a n d s in their policy State-
ment w h i c h school students w o u l d
unite b e h i n d are probably the aboli-
tion of religious education a n d school
uniform. A n d these are by no means
as contentious as the draft issue in
France a n d other European countries.
Unfortunately the N U S S seems as if
it 'is going to concentrate on other
issues, if it organises a campaign at
all.
It w o u l d b e a very s a d day w h e n
t h e * N U S S folded. But that day seems
bound to c o m e if their national or-
ganisation remains as b a d as their
conference organisation. It is admit-
tedly only a year this month since the
N U S S w a s formed. B u t , to survive,
such a U n i o n cannot afford to start
gradually a n d work upwards. It needs
to start w i t h a bang. A n d unless the
N U S S generates the bang soon them-
selves, they might w e l l find it going
off under them.
No Pay
f o r
Bookshop
Staff
Staff at the I C book-
shop worked through the
last weekend i n M a r c h
both Saturday and Sun-
day, without receiving
any pay at a l l . Prior to
this a notice was sent
round the staff which
read something like this:
Because of V A T , a com-
plete stocktaking must
be done by M a r c h 31st.
This may necessitate staff
working the whole of that
weekend. A s is usual i n
such cases no overtime
will be paid. .
The reason w h y over-
time is not usually paid
in such cases c a n be
found i n section 8 of the
terms of service for book-
shop staff: " n o overtime
will be paid i n view of
the length of the annual
leave." This is 4 weeks
paid holiday i n the first
year for young staff a n d 7
in the second and follow-
ing years.
The stocktaking re-
quired for V A T h a d to
be continued into M o n -
day a n d Tuesday too a n d
the bookshop was closed
on those days.
Following an interview
with the R C S bookshop
committee member an of-
fer of an extra one day's
holiday with pay was
made to the staff, but this
still leaves five staff who
gave up their whole
weekend to work, with-
out payment i n holiday
or cash for one of those
days.
A POET'S NIGHTMARE
T h e t u r n o f t h e
T a c i t u r n N a n
In A f r i c a I travelled south!
— I came, I s a w , I c l o s e d m y mouth;
Then feared some heartless racial b a n
For having such a healthy tan,
So sat w i t h i n the shade a n d s a w
South A f r i c a n T V . . . a n d more.
A n d more!
I dozed, then dreamt in hushed distress
I played South A f r i c a at chess
But lost the game in fading light;
— Since white c o u l d only move on white
A n d b l a c k c o u l d only move on black,
M y moves were only there . . . a n d back.
A l a c k !
But should w e British let it pass
To know w e segregate by c l a s s ?
A l a s !
