Dear Oily,
I don't know if you want to print this —• it's a report of what actually happened on
ICWA Hockey Tour as reported by Captain, rather than two drunken members of
tectml Anyway use it if you want to.

Dear Janet.
The two ladies I interviewed certainly weren't drunk at the time (11 a.m.) and
consequently left most of the details to my imagination. Unfortunately, my imagin-
ation doesn't stretch to guessing the scores you got, so I've decided to print your
article and leave anything else to the reader's imagination.
Incidentally, Janet, can you understand why only you and the male exponents
of your sport are the only ICACC clubs to send me reports to print every week!

This year, for the first time ever, I.C.
ladies' hockey team qualified for a grant
to play abroad at Easter. After the ini-
tial rejoicing at this news, we were faced
with the problem of finding somewhere
to go. This proved incredibly difficult, as
all clubs we contacted seemed loath to
reply, and time had almost run out when
Laren M i x e d H . C . , near Amsterdam,
accepted us to play in their Easter tour:
nament. B y this time, however, all flights
to Amsterdam had long been booked,
and so it came about that o n G o o d
Friday, 12 intrepid lady hockey players,
accompanied by a staunch supporter/
cameraman/chaperon, M r . J . Chilton
sailed from Dover in a Force 9 gale, and,
incredibly, managed to survive 4£ hours
on a rain-lashed sun-deck (the only space
available on the overcrowded boat) to
disembark, in various stages of sea-sick-
ness at Ostend. W e travelled from there
to Amsterdam, where our hosts conveyed
us to our accommodation — a really
plush motel. There we partook of liquid
refreshment until the small hours to pre-
pare ourselves for the impending hockey.
A t 1 p.m. the next day, after "infor-
mal drinks at the clubhouse", the tourna-
ment began, and with some trepidation
I.C. faced their first opponents, a fit-
looking bunch called Kameleon. W e still
aren't sure what happened, but we w o n
3-1 after playing 40 minutes. Surprise,
surprise, the same thing happened when
we played our next round against a team
called W . F . (we never found out what
this stood for, though several sugges-
tions were put forward). They seemed
more intent on protecting their hairstyles
from the teeming rain under layers of
plastic bags than scoring goals, and we
won again, this time 3-0. Thus inspired,
we went on to play our last opponents
that day, Huilen, and won 4-0. During
celebrations at the clubhouse, we dis-
covered that Slough men's nth team
were also taking part in the tournament
(or at least in the drinking), and there-
after they staunchley supported us (and
watched us playing hockey). That night
we attended a festival at the clubhouse,
and made merry until sometime on Sun-
day morning, this time varying con-
siderably from person to person. T h e
tournament restarted at 7 p.m. after
more informal drinks, and we beat our
next opponents, B e F a i r (yes, that was
the name of the club), by 4-0. This meant
that we met Laren Ladies, who had also
won a l l their matches, i n the final. This
was held o n the main pitch in front of
the clubhouse, before a stand thronged
with spectators, (notably the Slough
team, accompanied by several crates of
Heiniken) and i n an atmosphere nor-
mally encountered in the Wales-England
Rugby international, we won after a very
hard game by 1-0 the goal coming in the
last minute, making us the winners of the
tournament. Back at the bar (again!) we
were presented with a plaque to mark
the occasion, and badges commemorat-
ing the 50th anniversary of Laren H . C .
The last evening was spent in various
pursuits which shall remain unspecified
(though it should be mentioned that 4
members of the team were asked to leave
a sex shop in Amsterdam for causing a
disturbance — which shall also remain
unspecified — and two of the oldest
hands were noticed to sleep virtually all
next day).
On Monday morning we left Laren,
having been invited to next year's tour-
nament, and eventually arrived i n L o n -
don to end the trip with a celebratory
curry. Altogether, it was a most success-
ful event, and one which A . C . C . should
feel was well worth the grant provided,
since we managed to bring home a
trophy and impress the Dutch with the
standard of I.C. hockey as well as the
standard of I.C. alcohol consumption,
which has, after a l l , been done many,
many times before.

A s is traditional for the time of year,
I.C. hockey club sallied forth o n their
annual tour. However this was no ordi-
nary tour — the hockey club had quali-
fied for Europe. Thus, it was exception-
ally early o n Thursday morning, that
eleven stalwarts met to await the arrival
of their chauffeur-driven minibus, com-
plete with navigator, which was late as
usual. T h e hovercraft journey across the
channel was rather rough — a trip that
A l l e n Brown, alias Super Puke, will
gladly try to forget. Anyway, n hours
later we arrived in Zandvoort to survey
our luxurious accommodation (this is a
joke!) situated i n the pleasant surround-
ings of sand dunes and the local G r a n d
Prix race circuit — no R o n you can't
roll the minibus here.
The following day, eleven lecherous
hockey players decided t o sample the
whores, and mean wares of Amsterdam
Despite their good intentions, a l l roads
led to the R e d Light district—Soho has
got nothing on this. (For full details
contact Dave R i c h m a n , I.C.'s o w n porn
vendor). Thus I.C. returned to Zandvoort
exhausted after their trip. T h e evening
piss up was mainly noticeable for R o n
Palmer trying to move the sand dunes on
the way back to our temporary abode.
The hockey tournaments started on
Saturday afternoon with the I.C. A l l
Stars achieving a resounding goalless
draw i n their first game. After such a
commanding performance we continued
in the same vein and lost our next match
2-1, A l l e n Brown being our goalscorer.
The evening's festivities started with a
typical Indonesian meal (did anyone
finish the noodles?) and continued with
dancing, drinking, etc. until the early
hours of the morning (Allen certainly
works fast!).
Unfortunately we had our third game
of hockey at 10 a.m. the following day.
After a phenomenal effort we arrived o n
time to find that we had only three oppo-
nents. Feeling confident of victory we
prepared to start. However, foiled yet
again, we had to wait for the rest of our
opposition to turn up. In retribution, we
decide to inflict upon them another goal-
less draw (where was Wonder Boy! !).
The next two matches were played for
high stakes — a long lie in the following
morning, since the lower in the league
we finished the earlier we played. N o w
that the chips were down, I.C. powered
their way to two victories, by 5-0 and
2-1. The goalscorers were Dave R i c h m a n
(3), R o n Palmer (2) and John Andrews
(2). Another enjoyable evening's enter-
tainment ensued during which, despite
valiant efforts, R o n Palmer kept posses-
sion of his trousers.
The following day I.C. defeated Heer-
len 1-0 to finish third overall in the
tournament. W e had to keep the British
flag flying since N o r t h East Poly man-
aged to occupy the last two places. I.C.
celebrated their victory by flying Ron's
only pair of trousers from the flagpole
was spent sampling the nightlife of
outside the clubhouse. O u r final evening
Zandvoort or Amsterdam — what was
the strip show like John (Junior of
course)? W e returned "mit k l o m p e n " the
following day.
Special thanks go to Zandvoort Hoc-
key C l u b for being such excellent hosts.
Thanks must also be extended to our
three excellent drivers R o n Palmer,
John Andrews and especially B o b
Evans (guess w h o wrote the report?).

Major Car Hire Company
launches scheme for
18-year-olds
If you're under 23 a n d have ever tried to rent a
car, I've got good news for you. Hertz, one of Britain's
biggest car rental companies is now accepting eighteen-
year-old drivers for a large number of cars on its
fleet.
The requirement of
having held a full licence
for a year still remains,
and there is a "Collision
Damage W a i v e r " of
£1.50 per day or £9 per
week to pay in addition
to the normal rental fees.
This supplementary i n -
surance does, however,
mean that there is no ex-
cess. (I a m informed that
you c a n opt to leave a
£40 excess deposit when
you rent the car instead
of paying the Waiver).
Cars available for ren-
tal by 18—20-year-olds
include F o r d Escorts,
Cortinas and C a p r i 1600s.
Rates start at £2.95 a day
plus 3p a mile for the
Escort and go u p to £3.95
a day plus 4p a mile for
a C a p r i 1600 X L . There
are also weekly unlimited
mileage rates which
would pay you if you d i d
more than 60 miles a
day.
I was the first customer
for the new scheme at the
Victoria branch (they
have more than a dozen
branches i n London), and
found the bureaucracy a l -
ready well worked-out.
If y o u want to rent a
car, you'll have to make
sure that there is some-
one at the end of the
phone to say that they
know y o u •— no more
than that — when y o u go
to collect one for the first
time. After you've com-
pleted the formalities
once, you're set u p for
life. Y o u ' l l have to fill i n
a card with the name of
your employers, etc., etc.
. . . but don't worry,
they're expecting students
to come. Y o u will have to
leave a £25 deposit when
you collect the car, and
this is used when calcul-
ating the balance owing
to or d u e from y o u when
you return it.
Hertz make a great
point of their " R e n t it
here, leave it there" ser-
vice, which means that if
you want to rent a car in
Sittingbourne and leave it
in Motherwell, that's fine.
They will also collect and
deliver u p to five miles
without charge.
I borrowed a Capri,
and unfortunately dis-
covered that I h a d never
hated a car so m u c h after
only an hour's driving.
But that's a personal
quarrel between myself
and F o r d — no scars o n
poor o l d Hertz, whose
service I can't quibble
with at all. I know I shall
rent from them again —
even if it is an Escort
Central Reservation Ser-
vice next time!
The Hertz telephone
number for L o n d o n is 01-
876 4484; nearest branch
to I C is 25 Park Lane —
499 6618).
