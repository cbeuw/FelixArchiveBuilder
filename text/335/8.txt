BACUS (Bristol Area Students Paper)
REPORTER
THE G R A N T S Campaign is nearing its culmina-
tion for this academic year, for, if the Government
has not made a decision by May 21st, it will be
too late for local authorities to implement the
change for the coming academic year 1973/4. As
the deadline comes nearer, the N U S is exhorting
its Constituent Organisations to make their feelings
known—that the Government M U S T meet the NUS
Grants claim by May 21st. In order to make this
feeling clearer to the Government, N U S President,
Digby Jacks, handed in the following letter to the
Department of Education and Science on Monday,
7th M a y : —
" T H E G O V E R N M E N T fine, announced its

P r e s i d e n t ' s P i e c e
The saga of refectory prices continues. Over the
last few years refectory committee meetings the
indications of increase in prices have gradually
strengthened from a possibility to a likelihood.
Last week's committee should have received a pro-
jected budget for next year but this did not appear
as the April returns were not yet available. The lon-
ger the delay the less easy it will be for students
to react. For this reason the Union reps, proposed
that there be no price increases and that the Gov-
erning Body should pay for refurnishing and re-
decorating the bars and refectories.
We were told that the refectory committee does
not have the power to increase prices, only the Gov-
erning Body has. There will therefore be a special
meeting of the Refectory Committee to put a re-
port with all the figures before the Governing Body
which should make clear to them the reasons for
following the course we have suggested. This will
take place on Thursday morning so that the Union
meeting at 1.00 on Thursday will know the full pic-
ture and be able to act accordingly. The Grants Ac-
tion Committee has proposed that to put some
weight behind the Union's position we have a refec-
tory boycott and a picket of the Finance and Execu-
tive Committee of the Governing Body on 25 May.
Since we are demanding that the College defy a
ruling of the University Grants Committee and
therefore the Government, I believe that this sort
of demonstration of solidarity is necessary.
One point should be made. The Bars and Wine
Cellar make a profit. Previously the Union has said
that this should go to redecoration not to subsidis-
ing the refectories. Unless the College pay for re-
decoration something must suffer. Either price rises
or staff cuts, reduction in variety or quantity of de-
terioration of the bars and refecs. themselves must
result. All of these courses run the risk of driving
away cutom and thus causing deficits. But the fun-
damental argument remains that we are trying to
catch up with inflation. We must neither meekly
accept mere rises nor reductions in Standards of
staff.
Union Fee
The union gets £ 6 per student from the LEAs,
plus £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 from the College. A joint union/col-
lege working party has assessed that we need an
extra £ 4 , 9 0 0 to compensate for inflation and to
introduce modest increases in a few areas. Let's
hope we get it—your societies, whether I.C.U. or
C . C . U . depend on it—as does next year's Presi-
dent for his wages!
