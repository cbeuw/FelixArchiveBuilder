Dear Sir, - I was amazed and
suprised, etc, to read in last week's
Snooker club article that Kit Nair
not being a committee member
was the best thing to happen to
snooker Club in a long time.
What has this poor creature done
that M r Teelock, Sanjit,
President (2nd class) should
victimise him so?
O n a more serious note, I was
glad to see under Rag that next
years minor charities will include
Alcoholics anonymous rather
than the national organisation,
A l c o h o l i c s A n o n y m o u s . I
personally welcome a move such
as this, which will benefit the
average student, sell included.
Yours sinecurely,
K J Fenning.
Physics, sort of.

fortune writing American T V .
Dear Sir, - O n behalf of India!
Society I would like to condemn I
the attitude of the Independent!
Observer who wrote about India
Soc Elections (FELIX, 8th June).
The observer, though well-
informed in some aspects, wrote
about events which occurred
three weeks ago. The situation
had changed considerably by the
time he wrote his letter.
After the elections there was
still an outstanding post in the
committee. M r Purewal stood for
and was elected to that post after
which the situation was back to
normal.
The 'Independent Observer'
apparently did not care enough
to find out what was happening.
It seems to me that all he has
succeeded in doing is stirring up
trouble amongst society members
intentionally or otherwise. He did
not even have the courage to write
his letter openly.
Yours faithfully,
A Gujral, (Sec)
India Soc.
Dear Sir, - I was disgusted and
appalled on readinga letterabout
India Soc elections, written in bad
taste, by a self-styled independent
observer, since the contents of the
letter clearly reveal that the
person who wrote the letter was
completely biased. I utterly refute
his claim of'independence', since
I know that the author of the
letter is M r Vinodh Dhanak
(Chem) who has made an issue of
the election out of personal
animosity.
Immediately after the election,
I admitted defeat but soon
afterwards some of my supporters
pointed out that the two persons
(who were supporters of M r
Chakravarty) who did the
counting had deliberately
counted wrongly. It occurred to
me that this was a distinct
possibility.
M y supporters suggested I
should get signatures of people
who were dissatisfied with the
way the election was conducted.
T h e m o t i v e f o r o b t a i n i n g
signatures was to register a protest
not to force a re-election. I could
have forced a re-election since I
had more than enough signatures.
The nameless observer likes to
cower i n the security of his
anonymity. If he had the guts he
would have revealed his identity.
Sincerely yours,
Satinder Purewal

Dear It,
I feel I must correct the errors in
Sonia Hochlelder's correction of
R i c h Archer's errors last week.
Firstly, (to take the points in the
order she took them) the motion
did not mention the stripper, and
if Chris Fox said that the motion
would 'probably' (Sonia's word)
entail the exclusion of the
stripper, then he was talking out
ol his arse as he commonly does
(Hi! Chris). R i c h was merely
putting forward a statement of
intent, namely to drag the
Smoking Concert up out of the
shit which I a n d m y preceding
oilicers had allowed it to sink into.
H e reckoned (quite rightly) that
the standard of sketches in recent
years has fallen far below the
standard acceptable to the
Union, and has decided that his
w a y o f g e t t i n g d e c e n t
e n t e r t a i n m e n t v a l u e is t o
completely redesign the concert,
starting with the name. Though I
disagree entirely with the name
change, I applaud his motives for
proposing the motion, and wish
him great luck in his crusade
against the rest of the world as
Ents Supremo. T o return to last
week's letter, if M s . Hochfelder
had actually attended Smoking
Concert, she may have noticed
several pissed-up persons who
certainly tried to disrupt it,
though not through idealistic
p r i n c i p l e s , b u t t h r o u g h
straightforward cussedness. W e
(meaning I) had no cause for
complaint from the protesters. In
fact I thought they behaved quite
restrainedly (actually I never saw
them). Is this a sign of paranoia?
O h , and one other thing, isn't it
amazing how two people's
memories of the same meeting
differ? I am, of course, assuming
that our correspondent of last
week was actually present at it.
Yours,
M i c k M a g h a r
P.S. I bet the next line is 'This
correspondence is now closed'
Dear John,
M u c h t h o u g h I e s c h e w
c o n t i n u o u s b o r i n g c o l u m n s
appearing in F E L I X week alter
week, I a m prompted to reply to
Sonia Hochlelder's insane letter
ol last week, referring to R i c h
Archer's most commendable
letter of the week before referring
to Sonia's article of the week
before that.
Firstly, she complains that her
report did not say that the motion
mentioned the stripper, this is
highly unlikely because it didn't,
and anyway R i c h agrees with
this. Also she complains about M r
A r c h e r ' s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n o f
'undemocratic minorities'. She
seems to think that women
protesters were the only such
group in M r Fox's mind at the
time. If Sonia can divine Chris'
thoughts, good for her. I see it
only as R i c h trying to explain the
changes taking place.
Again M s Hochfelder seems to
think that adequate reason for the
name 'Headlights Revue' was not
given. However, R i c h Archer
explains at length the reasons for
the change. The name itself is sell-
explanatory but perhaps Sonia
has no 'esprit de camaradarie'
with our provincial colleagues.
In case anybody really is
wondering to whom R i c h is
referring when he said 'the people
who go to disrupt and drink free
beer', well I think he meant the
people who go to disrupt a n d
drink free beer.
Further, I can detect no
untoward references to women
protesters in R i c h A's letter, but I
do detect bees i n the Hochfelder
Bonnet, which seem to be the
raison d'etre of the whole letter.
I do not mind people airing
their (misguided) views in public
except when they try to twist the
meanings ol a sensible person and
the views of a democratic body. In
other words 'up yours'.
Sean O'Boyle,
R C S U President-elect
Dear J o h n , - I feel that I owe your
'ace reporter' an apology. Whilst
attending to m y daily chores,
some time ago, she approached
me and asked for interpretation
of a motion passed by an R C S U
Joint General Committee that I
had seconded. (Un) fortunately,
like life itself, a motion passed by a
caucus of nearly 50 is not without
its ambiguities. This, combined
with my rather inept use of the
English language, led to Sonia's
misunderstanding. I would like to
close with a fun but wouldn't
know how to have pun. (Brought
to y o u by 'Smoking Concert
sketches the world never saw
inc.').
Y o u r s ( U n ) r e p e n t a n t l y
ambiguous,
M r Fox
(but you can call m e Chris)

The Huxley Club
A small but significant number of IC graduates and postgraduates
enter the teaching profession each year, mostly, of course, to teach
science in secondary schools. In the belief that it might be both useful
and enjoyable to meet from time to time, a small group arranged an
inaugural dinner at the College in February 1979, the outcomeof which
was the formation of the Huxley Club.
The objects of the Club are to establish and maintain contact between
IC graduates now teaching and to create a closer and more abiding link
between their schools a n d the College than otherwise exists.
Membership is open to an ex-IC graduate or postgraduate now
teaching. An Annual Dinner is to be arranged during the winter, usually
in London, and in addition there will bea more informal gathering in the
summer outside London, at which guests are welcome (in June 1979
this took the form of a buffet luncheon at Clifton College, after which
those present were shown round the Science department).
There is no membership subscription, but an appropriate charge to
those attending is made to pay the cost of each function. Plans are now
being made for the next Annual Dinner, to be held early in 1980, which
will probably take place at Dulwich College.
Any ex-IC graduate or postgraduate now teaching, who would like to
join the Huxley Club is asked to write to the Chairman,
Mr David Rossell,
21 Mallard Road,
Selsdon Vale,
South Croydon.
(telephone 01-651 2819)
The Club would also like to be of assistance to any present IC
students intending or contemplating a teaching career. Any such are
cordially invited to get in touch with the Club's IC Correspondent, Mr
John Thole, at 53 Princes Gate (internal telephone 2659).
