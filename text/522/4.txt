Volunteer Work At WUS (UK)
W U S (UK) requites volunteers to assist in the operation of our
Refugee Student Scholarship Programmes.
We operate a number of scholarship programmes for refugee
students from Chile, Uganda, Ethiopia and several other countries.
During the summer vacation we will be looking for a number of
volunteers to help with our various programmes. The work will involve
letter writing, compiling information and providing back-up assistance
to the secretariat. A working knowledge of Spanish would be an
advantage, but is not essential.

TRAVEL STUDENTS
OF LONDON
Exhausted after my effort of a fortnight ago I decided to carry on
avoiding John Harris for another week and leave another article until
this week. Not that John is particularly terrifying but it was hand written
on unlined paper with crossings-out and insertions and so forth to the
extent that he drove me out of the FELIX office to get this article typed in
the Union Office, (he will be sorry) and it went on for ever! However,
judging by the contents of last week's issue (size, editorial and page 4
article) he is really pushed for copy so here goes for this week's ego-trip
(which is the only kind of trip I am going on this year).
Enough of the above rubbish, exciting things are happening at
London Student Travel, For a start we have a new advertising slogan,
which runs 'For a choiceof 500 make 117 the first' (117 Euston Rd,
geddit!). If you want to see the complete poster there are four copies
around IC, one at IF, and one at R C M so get looking.
Secondly we have signed a sole-suppliers contract with Transalpino
for European rail journeys. This benefits L S T in so much as we get
higher commissions, and benefits you, our customers, in so far as LST
stipulates that Transalpino must be competitive (against Eurotrain
mainly).
Thirdly, the Head Office (117 Euston rd) has started producing a
weekly news sheet outlining the journeys and prices LST has on offer
for distribution around Union C o m m o n Rooms in the London Colleges.
Moreover they are keen that someone at Imperial College should
produce a similar item for distribution at IC and environs and Chelsea
College, Q E C , E T C . (did you know that people come from
Hammersmith Polytechnic to use the IC office of LST?). Now, dare I
plead 3rd year student? (I have this kind of death-wish that pushes me
on to face the virtual inevitability that I will be a 3rd year next year) And
that I can't type, or use a Gestetner and where is Q E C anyway? What I'm
saying is that, if a news sheet is to be produced next year I would
appreciate some help. S o any keen body reading this who would like to
help, will you please go into the L S T Office and tell Cathy your name,
year and Department and I shall try not to forget all abgout you and
contact y o u early next year.
In the meantime, Malcolm Brain would like to see a flood of people
booking their holidays through L S T next week because he wants to
become a Director (so do I but don't tell anybody) so don't disappoint
him.

Elk's Last Stand
Well folks, only one week of
t e r m left now - soon you can
all disappear into the depths
of Britain and earn thousands
of pounds working 24hr
shifts, 7 days a week i n
factories or walking the
streets of Earls Court saying
to r a n d o m passers-by who
look at you with lust i n their
eyes 'Hello Sailor - would you
like an 'orrible time?'.
Enough of these sordid ways of
earning a living. I've got a couple
of things to plug this week.
PARKING PERMITS
(of the temporary kind)
Well, after I'd got all the
applications in for temporary
parking permits I found that there
were more places than there were
applications for a J u l y permit.
That is, everybody who applied
gets a place, proving perhaps that
this scheme was a little futile - it
was College's idea, not mine.
Anyway, as there are spaces left
over I'm not sure whether it's
worth issuing permits or not just
for July. I'll discuss it with J o h n
Fuller, traffic warden at the
Exhibition R o a d entrance, and if
we decide to issue them then
I'll send them to individuals and
they should arrive sometime in
the last week of term.
PARTIES, COUNCILS,
CAMPING EQUIPMENT,SEX
AND VM
Here comes another plug for
the Exec. Party. Bring a bottle (to
drink after the end of the bar
extension). It's on Thursday 21st
June in the J C R a n d I've been
told it's going to turn into one
helluva orgy with naked bodies
writhing all over the floor a n d
spilling onto the walkway. O h
yes, bring your o w n fetish.
Joint C o u n c i l is takng place this
M o n d a y at 2 p m in the U n i o n
D i n i n g H a l l , observers welcome.
The chap who runs the stall
which occasionally appears in the
J C R and sells cheap camping
equipment says students are
welcome to call at his factory over
the Summer and actually buy
stuff there. H i s address is 48
Rawstone St., L o n d o n E C 1 . T e l :
837 2201/2, so just call there if
you want to get some cheap
camping equipment. If you're
lucky he might sell you some
cheap bondage equipment as
well.
Right, now that this article is
almost over I can frolic naked in
Beit Q u a d , giving everybody in
the F E L I X Office a turn-on and
go and sell my body in the
Sherfield Building. Pity there's
nobody there in the evening - I
might have lo give it away for
free.
Hope to see you in the last week
of term, in my shower if nowhere
else.
