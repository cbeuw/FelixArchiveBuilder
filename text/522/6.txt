P e t e r r e a d the f o l l o w i n g :
'Peter, I w i l l be honest w i t h y o u , just as I a l w a y s have. W h e n y o u r e a d this I w i l l be

m y c h i l d r e n . I d o n ' t k n o w if y o u ' l l ever w a n t to see m e a g a i n , but V i r g i l a n d I ...'
Peter could read no more. In a fury, he tore
the letter into tiny shreds and scattered them
to the wind. Immobile, he stood on the
quayside, his arms hanging limply by his side.
T h e dying rays of the sun traced out his
s o l i t a r y s h a d o w . F i n a l l y , the sunset
bequeathed the night. T h e world was cast
into an eerie twilight.
T h e boat's whistle heralded its departure.
T h e last person aboard, he stumbled onto
deck without really knowing where he was or
what he was doing. Suddenly, he felt as
vengeful as Achilles. H e would strangle them
both in their sleep then drink a long,
refreshing draught from that cup of hemlock.
As they had lived and loved together, they
would die together. A n d to think that her
poisoned womb had begun this avalanche of
T h e n he would recall fragments of his
union with Susan: each one a bitter-sweet
reminder ofthe ineffable joy he so frequently
experienced with her, and the horrible
lonliness which awaited him without her.
Next, he began to lampoon her: her
ridiculous hook nose, her neurotic habits, the
shrill tenor of her voice.
Alternatively, love and hate, respect and
contempt, swelled in his heart like the ebb
and flow of the ocean.
T h e night was sweltering. For most of it,
the boon of sleep evaded him. L i k e a fugitive
desire, it tantilised him with its offer of relief
from anguish of consciousness.
Eventually, his eyes did close, and he
awoke with the feeling that he hadn't slept at
all. T h e hustle and bustle of Pireus, the Port
of Athens, rose to his ears. For some
unaccountable reason, he remembered the
last time he had approached Athens...yes it
was then that he had hatched his scheme to
avenge himself on his 'adulterous' w i f c . i t
was then he had thought of L u c y !
What an enchanting, exquisite English
Rose, yet a reluctant adult like all
adolescents. Yes, and it was she who carried
his child, of that there was no doubt. After
prolonged deliberation, he resolved to see her
as soon as he returned to L o n d o n . But, no. O n
second thoughts, that would be disrespectful
to his father. H e would wait until after the
funeral, then, yes then he would propose that
they live together. She would be his hope,
a hope that would not abandon him.
A heavy gloom shrouded the cemetary. It
was a fitting day for the old man's funeral,
Peter thought to himself. His mother stepped
out of the car behind his. H e greeted her
coldly, almost as if she had been a stranger.
They barely spoke - Peter absorbed in his
sombre melancholia, his mother weeping
profusely. This air of mourning was almost
claustrophobic.
The family group were kept waiting for
over an hour. By now the slight drizzle had
become a light rain. Apparently, earlier that
morning, due to the slippery surface, one of
the grave-diggers had fallen into a freshly-
dug grave, and twisted his ankle. T h e vicar,
effusive in his apologies, assured them that a
replacement was being sought. W i t h the
Grace of G o d , he added, and the assistance of
the local L a b o u r Exchange, one would be
found.
At long last, the ceremony took place.
Peter listened to the tedious monologue of
religious euphemisms with disinterest.
Perhaps some day their meaning would
become apparent to him.
Immediately the vicar had completed the
ceremony he offered his condolences, then
rushed back to the church with the air of a
man who has the devil at his heels. Peter
thought it would be apt if he was about to
prepare for a christening. As his family
departed, Peter wandered aimlessly round
the grave-yard, enshrined in his own silence.
After a while, he heard the distinctive toll
of wedding bells, and, feeling refreshed, he
walked back in the direction of the church.
There, a sea of cheerful faces washed over
him, dispelling the pathos of his thoughts. A
group of about forty wedding guests had
gathered on the church steps.
'Angels of youth, fly high, fly eagle high,'
Peter mused poetically to himself. H e wished
this couple well, whoever they were, and
better fortune than he had had.
As the bride and groom emerged from the
chapel, their guests enveloped them with the
traditional covering of confetti. Peter tried to
press through the crowd to give the couple his
own benediction. T h e n suddenly, he caught
a glimpse of the bride as they stepped into
their wedding car - he saw the swollen
stomach, the dainty figure and the flowing
features. It was L u c y ! She looked serenely
happy.
In a moment, they were whisked away in
their marriage chariot.
As he turned to go home, that phrase, as
old as h u m a n suffering, sprang to his lips: ' A l l
is well,' he murmered, ' A l l is well'.
