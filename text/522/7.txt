THIS BOOK COULD CHANGE
YOUR LIFE.
We're a commercially successful company involved in major defence and civil
projects. We've been in the computer business for a quarter of a century. Today we're
producing Europe's first single chip microcomputer.
We see our job as putting the computer to work. Real-time, on-line computing.
It's an exciting but demanding role.
We're going to be on campus in the locations and on the dates shown above.
And we're going to be looking for bright, energetic graduates with a technology
biased background. With a degree in Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic or Production
Engineering. Or in Physics, Maths or Computer Science.
A 20 minute chat with our people could convince you that you've made the first
move towards a challenging, rewarding career, and convince us that you're the kind of
innovative individual we're lookingfor.
Why not talk to us about that first step when we visit your campus. It could be the
most important date you've ever kept.
