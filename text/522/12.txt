Swedes Continue
Visit to Britain
L a r s a n d M i a n , the two sabbaticals f r o m C h a l m e r s
University i n Sweden, continued their visit to Imperial College
this week.
Following M a r y Attenborough's attempt to give them a taste
of English cooking last week, at which she claims her second
Y o r k s h i r e pudding was alright, all the C h a l m e r s students
studying here were invited to a Swedish party last Friday.
In anticipation Lars, known as Aby by his friends, and M i a n had
specially imported some Swedish 'punch', a n d with the addition of
Danisi schnaps' the right atmosphere was created lor M a r y and other
I C students present to join in the singing oi Swedish drinking songs.
H a v i n g slept oil their hangovers, the next day M a r y took them to
Brighton, followed by yet another party in the evening.
Aby had expressed a wisli to see some cricket, so on Sunday M a r y and
former student Sheyne Lucock took the visitors to Harlington to see
part of the President's match. They soon tired of that however and
decided to continue westward by public transport to Silwood, not a n
easy task.
Alter a wine a n d cheese party on M o n d a y lunchtime at which a
small number of U n i o n officers consumed several bottles ol wine, M i a n
and Aby saw Bo, Jez, the College Archives and the House of Commons.
There Peter Brooke, M P for Westminster, provided them with tickets
for the public gallery where they heard part of the debate about the
future of Ocean Island.
A n d r e w Gilford, Personal Assistant to Liberal leader D a v i d Steel
then took them to the House of Lords bar where they also met M r s
Steel.
In the evening they went to see A n n i e - the musical not the U n i o n
receptionist.
Before leaving they presented the U n i o n with an ' E m i l ' a n d and
' E m i l i a ' , Chalmers student symbols. Aby then returned to Sweden
while M i a n continued her holiday in Ireland.

P R O B L E M eontd.)
T h e C o l l e g e h a v e been
concentrating their efforts on
housing around 1500 students in
Halls and Houses leaving the-
other 3000 to their o w n devices.
But whereas until now a l l
students were guaranteed at least
one year in a H a l l or House if they
wanted it, this year there were
more 3rd year students applying
for a place than places available
for 2nd and 3rd year new
applicants together.
But College cannot hope to
meet the heavy demand for
h o u s i n g by s p e n d i n g their
resources on schemes such as the
Linstead extension and Student
Houses. F o r every student place
in the new Linstead College has to
fork out over ;£10,000, and money
is very limited.
While students must welcome
this long overdue expansion in
College-owned accommodation,
College could do a lot more for
very little cost by entering into
head tenancy schemes. Such an
arrangement would allow College
to sublet Hats and rooms to
students w h i l e l e a v i n g the
landlord in charge. There would
be no financial outlay by College
apart from some administrative
costs.
M e a n w h i l e s t u d e n t s a r e
already beginning the hunt lor
a c c o m m o d a t i o n f o r n e x t
October. In the last few days there
has been a daily flow of 15 to 20
students up to M i c h a e l Arthur's
office seeking help.
Some students go to the very
unsatisfactory U n i v e r s i t y o f
L o n d o n Accommodation Office.
M a n y others are forced to seek out
flat agencies where they pay
exhorbitant charges only to get
expensive accommodation a long
way from College.
Yet the College think there is
no problem.
This year the U n i o n have made
several attempts to persuade
College to do more to help their
students. But most ofthe Union's
ideas have been coolly received.
M i c h a e l A r t h u r has also gone
ahead with his own schemes such
as forming a cooperative to
renovate short-life p r o p e r t y
which will be available in
October at around £3 per week.
But M i c h a e l Arthur's time is
limited. His job is to run a Welfare
Centre not an accommodation
office. College, however, ignored
the Union's plea for a full time
Accommodation Officer.
It is high time that the College
realise that two thirds of their
students face an annual housing
problem and do more about it.

WOMEN'S SAFETY
U n i o n Safety Representative
Bernard Smith is to enter into
preliminary discussions with the
College about the safety of \

students especially in Beit H a l l .
T h e U n i o n is drawing u p a list o f
proposals.
INSURANCE CHANGE
The amount that can be
claimed for loss of cassettes under
the Halls of Residence insurance
policy has been raised from £75 to
£\50. T h e policy premium
remains the same next year.
WASTE OF TIME
The scheme to issue students
with parking permits for J u l y has
proved a waste of time as less
students have applied than there-
are permits available.
A l l applicants will therefore
receive permits and College will
have to find some other way of
dealing with traffic congestion in
Imperial Institute Road.
POLICE CHASE
T w o students were chased by
police around the Beit Q u a d on
M o n d a y night following the
disappearance o f a bollard. They
were due to appear in Court on
