BATTLESHIP EROTICA
Eventually it had to happen. The double x rated Star Wars rip off has
arrived - not with a bang, but a whimper and a groan. Apologies but the
film is indisputably a remix of WW11 dogfight scenes, themes first
articulated in Star Trek (ST for short), Star Wars (SW) special effects
and noise levels and Barbarella fantasy.
Viewed as anything other than bluish disposable entertainment the
film falls flat on its back. A s a big budget superglossy exercise in
perfection and escapism it fails abysmally. The plot contains the most
incredible faults - what S a m Goldwyn did for the English language,
Justin P Zlanzazywyz or something , the Producer, has done for
Hollywood. Example: Almost the entirity of humanity have been
destroyed. A handful of survivors remain, barely able get the hell out of
the Solar System. The enemy, the Silos, wish to destroy every last
human, so what do the survivors do? You guessed, they lead the enemy
directly to the last remaining human colony - Starbase 69 (I said it was
bad did I not?) - which is only rumoured to exist, and is almost certainly
unarmed.
Unlike SWs, where a great deal
of thought went into the technicial
feasabilities, this film uses money
and little thought. The result is a
string of hilarious mistakes which
when briefly listed cover a side of
A4. H e r e are s o m e p r i m e
examples : Two of our fighter craft
( w h i c h l o o k a l i t t l e l i k e
Thunderflash jet fighters) are
running away from thousands of
enemy fighters (no low budget
film, this) at least half the velocity
of light, when they decide to take
evasive action - reverse thrust -
and fully reverse in a fraction of a
second. Do that in a mere
supersonic jet, or a Saturn V, and
you would leave the cockpit in
matchboxes.
There are of course the
standard errors - apparently
interstellar vacuums carry the
sound of explosions very well.
Fighter ships, battlestars and even
whole planets, alright, one little
one, explodes, Why? Well, y o u
see this small intergalatic craft
capable of withstanding attacks
from massed perspex tubes
with lightbulbs in the ends, gets a
little close to the planet, and well
you see, these big bolts of
lightening shoot to and fro, and
then it sort of explodes taking the
planet with it - I suppose the
planet was called Krypton.
The film is slightly entertaining,
but even watching it through
several cans of Swan and pints of
Ruddles I was mildly iritated and
disgruntled throughout the film.
The producer relied too heavily on
two things - effects and the
bandwaggon. To some extent the
film is sold on its technical merits
alone - sound in 'Gropearound'
(copyright) and Dooley 'A' Noise
C r e a t i o n S y s t e m , f i l m e d in
Widevision. The next step will be
N o i s e by Z a p p a ' or s o m e
equivalent - already cinemas are
i s s u i n g d i s c l a i m e r s ( t h e ,
m a n a g e m e n t a c c e p t s n o
responsability for any physicial
effects caused by Gropearound...,
and that is a quote).
Remember the days when
Technicolour was a means to and
end rather than a mean end in
itself? The spin offs associated
with the film would amaze even
snooker club - the book, the home
movie, the film behind the scenes,
the sound track, the Battleship
Car Headlights (why settle for less
t h a n e i g h t ? D a z z l e y o u r
friends...), the imitation radio
commercials and, of course, the
computer programe of the film
(algorithm to detect its use
available. Contact ICCC.)
Things are not all bad - true the
baddies were. They forgot their
lines, missed cues, ham act and
probably belong to trade unions -
seriously though, there is a light at
the end of the perspex tube.
Despite this film being seen in the
West E n d , on a Saturday, the
cinema was 2/3 empty - too many
rip offs have achieved saturation
level. Star Wars 2 may do well,
but its imitators will not. Not even
Emanuell Meets The Wookie, a
novel idea. In retrospect it
becomes clear that Star Trek was
of a high standard, even if there
were only three basic plots.

Tubeway A r m y - Replicas
(Beggar's Banquet)
Tubeway A r m y do not exist. In
fact they disbanded last July, yet
here is a new Tubeway A r m y
album. Confusing, eh? W e l l
perhaps until you realise that the
A r m y is really G a r y N u m a n who
sings and plays all the instruments
except drums (his uncle Jess
L i b y a r d ) a n d bass ( P a u l
Gardiner).
The a l b u m cover, which finds
N u m a n , bleached hair, black nail
polish and make-up, staring at his
own reflection is a dark window,
points to the musical direction -
alienation - a n d the track listing
confirms it; 'Praying to the Aliens'
and T Nearly M a r r i e d a H u m a n '
are but a couple. But is it good?
W e l l , n o . S o m e o f it is
exceptional, but as a whole it
comes across like some cheap
imitation of 'low' Bowie or early
Kraftwork.
T h e standout material is on the
first side; ' M e ! I Disconnect from
Y o u ' c o m b i n e s s y n t h e s i s e r
fanfares a n d chanting vocals
excellently and is followed by the
best track on the album, ' A r e
'Friends' Electric?', the current
picture disc single. A lonely man
pleas for help; 'low know I hale lo
ask / Bui are friends electric:'
Only mine's broke down I And now
I've no-one to love.'
I really can't enthuse too much
about this. So then the album
starts with two fine tracks both
filled with melodic keyboards,
unnerving vocals a n d a fine
rhythm backing. So why doesn't
it last? I don't know, ask Gary.
The problem with many of the
other songs is that they sound too
much alike, though 'Praying to
the Aliens' stands out, with its
strange view of the future. It's one
of the few cuts which, while
aiming for a specific effect, doesn't
get bogged down in the process.
N u m a n writes of machines and
alienation, a n d then complains
that people ignore him. Well, my
lad, maybe we're just not ready
for it. A l l this said, it's a valiant
attempt, brave even on the part of
his record company, Beggar's
Banquet. T h e music retains the
chilling starkness which it strives
for, but somewhere along the line
it falls desparately short.
Jon F i r t h
'Gimme Some Neck' - Ron Wood
(CBS)
'Gimme some Neck' is R o n
Wood's third solo album to date,
and with a history as impeccable
as his, (he has played with bands
such as; the Birds, Creation, Jeff
Beck Group, Faces and now the
Stones), it is only natural that
great things are expected of this
album. A d d to that the line-up of
big names, such as Mick Jagger,
Keith Richards and Charlie Watts
from the Stones, Mick Fleetwood
from Fleetwood Mac plus an ex-
member of the Faces and a
handful of other equally well
qualified musicians, anything
short of excellence from the
album would be disapppointing.
However, disappointing the
album certainly is not. Listening
to the album just once was
enough to persuade me that if Mr
Wood gives a concert in the near
future, I shall be one of the first to
rush out for tickets.
To be chosen as lead guitarist
for the Rolling Stones, who have
every right to be particular about
whom they choose to join them,
must say something about the
quality of Ron Wood's guitar
playing.
Side One opens with a track
heavily featuring honky-tonky
piano and powered by Charlie
Watts hammering away in his own
inimitable style it is a typical
example of the fine rock featured
on the Album, most of the songs,
in true Stones style, are built
around a framework of slashing
guitar chords, setting the rhythm,
backed up by a very strong
p e r c u s s i o n s e c t i o n . I n d e e d
Gimme Some Neck' sounds like it
could almost be the latest offering
by the Rolling Stones, with the
exception of a couple of tracks.
The most obvious exception,
being one of three of the eleven
songs not written by Wood, is
'Seven Days' which was written by
Bob Dylan especially for the
record. Ron Wood manages to
sing it sounding more like Dylan
than Dylan usually does; couple
that with the drumming coming
from M i c k F l e e t w o o d , t h e
drummer for Fleetwood M a c and
you end up with a thoroughly
satisfactory song, probably the
strongest on the whole album.
A n o t h e r t r a c k w o r t h y of
particular scrutiny is ' F U C her', a
w i t t y , r a t h e r c r u d e b u t
nevertheless amusing look at the
attitude of someone who, it -
seems, has been snubbed by an
attractive lady, and is trying to
warn others about her dubious
integrity. Here's part of the
chorus:
...'A COC teaser - an ice-cream
squeezer,
Her CUN really do you in,
So don't try to FUC her if I
wouldn't
touch her with mine....'
Probably the only fault with this
album is that although the content
is very sound, the music played
and sung remarkably express-
ively there are so many bands
playing this sort of rock so well
that to produce a chart-topping
record it must be a compilation of
classics, or have a million selling
name attached.
