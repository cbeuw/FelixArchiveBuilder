So It Goes
Crammed
★★✩✩✩
Coming from their new (ludicrously
titled) album that will apparently “tran-
scend the internet” according to its
producer, Akron/Family’s new song
‘So It Goes’ finds the band in typical
‘give everything a try’ mode. The song
starts with tribal chanting before giv-
ing way to a rocking 1970s-indebted
section, and ends with a beautiful folk
coda. While all the component parts
are good, it is essentially several short
ideas jammed together, and feels like it,
resulting in a song that as a whole is
strangely forgettable.
Jamie Fraser
Some people take music way too se-
riously. Praise Jeebus then for bands
like The Eleven 37s. Mixing the fun
vibes of funk with the raw energy of
rock, they play party music of the best
breed, sure to get you dancing and
leaving you with a smile on your face.
We spoke about crazy dancing, gig
size to satisfaction ratios and what
they’ll bring on February 19th, when
they headline 19.02 .
Have you guys always played funk?
Luke (guitar, vocals): Stuff of that genre-
ish. We all love the Chilli Peppers. We
started off by doing Chilli Peppers cov-
ers and then started writing songs to-
gether and this is how it turned out. This
ended up being what we wanted to play.
Jamie (vocals, keyboard, crazy danc-
ing): I think it took us a long time to get
to what we wanted to do style wise.
Luke: It was hard, because we’re all
quite different musicians, in terms of
what we want to do. And we just try and
fit that all in together.
Jamie: It works though. Because we all
have so many different ideas. We set
fire to each other occasionally, if we
don’t like an idea. But that’s alright, you
know. The wounds heal. The scars are
there for a while…
Luke: I’m trying to keep a straight face
here.
What are some of your influences?
Luke: We all have properly different
influences. We have lots of different
ideas and we all have to decide together
whether we like it or not. It’s difficult to
mix and match.
Jamie: It’s the perception of what we
think of funk.
Luke: That’s been an issue sometimes.
19.02:Fun-loving funk
Wild funk rockers The Eleven 37s will bring their fun-filled funk
parade to the first Felix Music Night on Saturday 19th Feburary
Some people are expecting like James
Brown or whatever. That’s not really it.
Jamie: We see the fun side of the music.
Luke: Mixing it all up, it’s a good at-
mosphere to have. And we try to bring
people into it as much as we can.
Jamie: It’s nice to do something differ-
ent. We’ve had 3 EPs now. The first one
was a mix of everything: a mish-mash
of ideas. We were young. I think we’re
progressing all the time.
Luke: It’s gonna keep changing. I dunno
where we’re gonna end up but we’re just
gonna keep writing.
Jamie: We definitely have an idea of
where we’re heading, but if we didn’t
progress all the time, we’d get bored
of it. And then people would get bored
of it. It’s great to keep just writing new
stuff all the time.
Do you prefer big or small gigs?
Luke: It kind of varies. We’ve had a few
over the past few months that have been
really quite big gigs. We played Proud
Camden, we’re playing it again at the
end of February. We’ve played some
much smaller places. We started out
doing a lot, hitting the scene, just for
practice. Just get our music to as many
people as we could. Really small places
sometimes.
Jamie: It really does vary though. You
can play a massive venue and it can
be really amazing lighting and sound,
but just be an awful gig. You can play
a tiny little place, and the sound can be
brilliant in there. It’s literally what hap-
pened the other week.
Luke: Yeah at the Urban Bar. We went
in there and the sound was just right on
the dot, and we played to 15-20 people
and it was amazing. It was so much fun.
Jamie: We played Monto like the week
before, which is a great venue, but we
just didn’t enjoy it as much.
Luke: We couldn’t get the sound quite
right, and the crowd just wasn’t as into it
as we hoped they’d be.
Jamie: It’s all about the atmosphere,
it’s what we thrive on at these shows,
all the time. If they’re not enjoying it,
we’re not gonna enjoy it. Simple as
that. So that’s why we’re always so
crazy on stage.
The Eleven 37s getting all funk’d up and spreading mad love
Luke: You should get a load of this guy.
Jamie: Crazy dancing.
Luke: When we started off it was diffi-
cult getting the performance right. We
were young, and scared of people. Now
we’re hitting our stride, getting some
good performances in. Before getting
the performances right, you have to get
the right sound, you need to be able to
play it right.
Jamie: You have to be happy with it.
It’s exactly like when we’re writing as
well, four of us can love a song. This
happened the other week, Luke doesn’t
mind me saying this. Because I can read
his mind it’s fine. But we had a song that
we all liked, but Luke wasn’t too keen
on it. We had to drop it, because if you
don’t all like it, it’s pointless. You’re
not gonna perform as a band. Four of
us might perform, but that’s not gonna
help. All five need to be enjoying that
song to get the atmosphere across.
Luke: With different backgrounds
there’s always gonna be some disagree-
ment. We just have to keep trying new
ideas and finding something everyone
likes. It turns out that when everyone
likes something, it’s usually very good.
Jamie: That’s definitely what’s hap-
pened writing-wise over the past year.
We released “Here comes the storm”
about a year ago, and we’ve been pro-
moting that for a year. In that time we’ve
written loads of songs but I think we’ve
only taken two out of there cos not ev-
eryone’s been comfortable with the
songs we’ve written. It’s good because
the response we’ve been getting from
these new songs that have come out are
amazing. People are absolutely loving
them which is great.
“Strawberry Swing”, that’s a great one.
And it’s not a Coldplay reference, con-
trary to what people think.
What will you guys bring to 19.02?
Jamie: The best music ever.
Luke: The best.
Jamie: Ever.
Luke: And some fun somewhere in the
mix.
Jamie: Some fun, some dancing. I bring
strawberries to shows now. They’re
good strawberries though. They did
complain last time that they were in my
shoe, but they were bought fresh! They
were quite nice.
Luke: They were alright.
Jamie: Yeah they were good. Obama’s
coming, actually. He said he’s pretty
excited about it, he texts me about it.
He didn’t want to put it in the news or
anything.
Luke: He didn’t want to shout out about
it.
Jamie: You don’t want to do that, he’s
just gonna attract attention.
Luke: He’s just gonna turn up, stay in
the background with a hood up, so no
one spots him.
Jamie: Yeah I can see him in the office
like: “Aaaw yea” and grooving. “Lovin
this”. Michelle Obama’s in there just
like: “What are you doing? President
Obama?”
Luke: What were we talking about?
The Eleven 37s are playing a free gig
