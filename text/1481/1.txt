Tuition fees of £9000 a year would be
“far more preferable” according to the
ICU President, Alex Kendall, as well as
the norm for “the majority of universi-
ties” according to the NUS President,
Aaron Porter. These latest comments
have arisen as the “Student Fees and Fi-
nancial Aid Working Group” established
at Imperial works to determine where
the tuition fee level will be set from
2012.
In December, the government voted to
allow tuition fees to rise to £6000 and
up to £9000 in “exceptional circum-
stances”. This controversial policy was
developed as the government’s response
to a review of higher education funding
by former BP chief Lord Browne.
The criteria that universities must
meet for charging above £6000 are yet
to be revealed although it is likely that
they will require efforts to attract poorer
students through more extensive finan-
cial aid systems. Dr. Rodney Eastwood,
Secretary of Imperial College and a
member of the working group, also be-
lieves “they will be keen on universities
developing outreach work, which Impe-
rial has an enviably strong reputation
for, especially to schools which do not
traditionally send many students to the
most selective universities.”
Universities Minister, David Willetts,
has suggested that universities could
qualify for charging up to £9000 if they
have high teaching costs or offer an in-
tensive two year course. By offering a
wide array of expensive science and en-
gineering degrees, with few humanities
courses to help subsidize them, it seems
likely that Imperial will be allowed to
charge up to £9000 at least on the basis
