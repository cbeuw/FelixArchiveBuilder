Tis’ the season. Award ceremonies are
everywhere as the ultimate narcissists
congratulate themselves on just how
wonderful they are.
I don’t know about you but that’s my
idea of a fun night in. I love the red car-
pet, the utter rubbish people say about
how grateful they are for the free booze
and their nominations, as well as all the
sparkly dresses. However I know that
the Americans totally out-do us on the
grandeur stakes. For a while I wondered
if that was reflective of the dif-
ferences between American
and British television. Can
the output of British tel-
evision really compete?
Until the last year or so
I can’t say I watched
anything British
that I thought was
must-see tel-
evision, but I’ve
come to change
my mind and sud-
denly have a vested
interest in our
own award
ceremonies.
Which brings me to the Bafta’s ugly
stepsisters. The National Television
Awards.
Don’t you just love the name? Makes
it sound all important. However I sus-
pect it’s just a way for ITV to throw a
party that can air fill an evening of telly.
The change from Trevor McDonald as
host to lovable cheeky chappy Dermot
O’Leary really emphasizes the tone
the awards is aiming for. Don’t get me
wrong, I enjoyed it anyway. What with
my own snarky inner dialogue enter-
taining me. Shamefully I did find by
the end of the night that no matter how
ridiculous you consider an award cer-
emony, if you you sit down to watch,
before you know it you’re fighting
a corner. I knew it meant little
and the shows were aimed at
an Eastenders loving audi-
ence, but I just couldn’t help
myself.
Sherlock and Moffat were
totally slapped in the face by
the choice of Waterloo Road
as best drama. What were they
thinking? I know which one I
would flag up as must see TV
and that would be the one with-
out the shiny prize. This is a show
that celebrates all awful television
out there, best comedy show – Beni-
What We Watched...
The words ‘Period Drama’ usually conjure up a rose-
tinted image of vast country estates, sunshine and
happy endings. The fact that The Tudors isn’t shown
at prime time may lead one to believe that it is just
more of the aforementioned – possibly a repeat; rath-
er than the fact that it is actually a massive shagfest.
King Henry is wonderfully portrayed as the bit-of-a-
dick he probably was, and his wife (or the current one
at least) looks young enough to make him a nonce
by today’s standards. She’s a daft bint too. Most of
the characters are engaged in a spot of extra-marital
banging, and in this week’s episode the King’s foot-
man ploughed the Queen.
And in case you need any more reason to watch it –
Henry Cavill, the British actor who was recently cast
as Superman (and who previously narrowly missed
out on the roles of Batman and James Bond), plays
Charles Brandon, advisor to Henry VII.
The BBC’s This World programme follows the US
Immigration and Customs Enforcement service (‘The
Paedophile Hunters’) whilst they track down Ameri-
can citizens fiddling with kids abroad. The narra-
tor’s attempt to intone a serious nasal dirge into the
script, which includes phrases such as “found with a
large collection of dildos” perhaps makes light of a
rather disturbing subject matter.
Waterloo Road (a.k.a. The Amanda Burton Show)
returned this week for its sixth series. For viewers of
a public-school disposition it should form a fantas-
tic insight into the edification (or not) of the lower
classes. For myself, having attended a state compre-
hensive in that area generally known as ‘The North’;
it brings back fond memories of school! (Yes that’s
right... we used to watch it in lessons...).
A few new characters have been introduced to keep
things fresh but the plot is still as blatantly obvious
as an erection in a pair of Speedos. If you’re one of
those people who takes TV a little too seriously you’ll
feel the need to slap ‘Kyle Stack’ or ‘Finn Sharkey’
(what names...) most of the time, particularly if they
remind you of that twat that used to sit at the back
of the classroom shouting ‘cabbages’ at random
intervals.
Karen Fisher’s long-lost daughter returns and
makes false allegations of sexual assault which are
investigated by deputy Mr Mead - who, incidentally,
had it off with her sister last term (...banter!). This
somehow turns into an epic situation involving a
bull mastiff and some sickly student-teacher flirting,
which I presume is designed to push even the most
cringe-immune of people over the edge.
The latest double-episode of Silent Witness was
something of a disappointment after last week’s
when we fretted for a whole twenty-four hours about
whether he was actually dead. This week we wonder
whether he’ll leave for another job. Those script writ-
ers really have it in for poor Harry.
Speaking of leaving; John Nettles’ role in the na-
tion’s favourite country crime-drama Midsomer Mur-
ders came to an end on Wednesday after sixteen
years of playing DCI Tom Barnaby. Anyone hoping for
an all-out murder extravaganza was disappointed as
Barnaby spent much of the two hours (being grumpy)
at a health retreat. There is murder in the end, but
it’s certainly not Nettles at his best. Hardly fitting for
the end of an era.

What to watch this week
Dermot O’Leary, the nation’s happy heart
Seriously, what television were they watching?
dorm? Really? Do I even want to know
what dross that involves? Did they see
the genius of the Inbetweeners? Yes I’m
a snob but could we at least celebrate
shows with a script and something that
didn’t involve a fair number of Bacardi
Breezers in its filming? And poor Dr
Who and Matt Smith, after four years of
dominating a show they both left losers
last week and I can’t help but take it as
a personal insult. I have of course gotten
too involved, forgetting the purpose of
the production; that it is not to reward
and recognise talent but for the likes of
the reality show starlets (ha!) to have a
good time. What was I thinking?
Thank God for the Baftas!
