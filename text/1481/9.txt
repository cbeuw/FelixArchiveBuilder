So, after quite a bit of work, talking to
student reps and debating the meaning
of really badly worded questions, we as
a Union sent off our submission to the
Government’s student visa consultation.
The consultation was launched at the
start of December for eight weeks, its
proposed changes aiming to both reduce
net immigration into the UK and limit
abuse of the student visa system by
people coming here to work rather than
study. Here’s how we responded:
We agree that highly accredited sponsor
institutions should be allowed to offer
below degree level courses, but that
these institutions should be given 1-2
years to become highly accredited.
We agree that we the Government should
raise the minimum English requirement
for entry.

We disagree with the proposal that if
students want to remain in the country
to study an additional course after their
first one, that they should have to provide
evidence of academic progression, as
this would limit those who choose to
swap degrees or do a second, unrelated
degree.
We also disagree will the proposal that
such students should have to leave the
UK and re-apply from overseas.
We disagree with the proposal to close
the Tier 1 Post Study Work route. This
route allows students to stay in the U.K.
for two years after their course to find
skilled work, and so closing it would
mean that the only route left is the Tier
2 migrant route, which only permits the
student to stay for four months during
which they must find a sponsor employer
to be able to stay and work.
We disagree with the proposal to further
reduce the 20 hours a week limit for full
time overseas student employment.
We disagree with the proposal that
students on a course of 12 months or
under should not be able to bring family
with them, and that any family members
permitted should not be allowed to work
here.
We agree that track records of
fraudulence in individual countries and
in sponsor institutions should be used
as a basis for differential examination of
application documents.
It’s expected that the results of this
consultation should come out in April. In
the meantime, if you have any concerns
