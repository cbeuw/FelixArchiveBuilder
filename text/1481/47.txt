O
n transfer deadline day
Chelsea spent around
£71 million. It was a
throwback to an era
around 5 years ago when
Abramovich spent over £200 million
bringing some of the best players in the
world to Chelsea. Players like Drogba
and Anelka, who remain in the team but
will soon have to leave or retire. Their
plan to sustainably build up the team
using their youth products has all but
failed, with 71 million spent on estab-
lished players and Sturridge and Kakuta
being shipped out on loan to Bolton and
Fulham respectively. This change in pol-
icy has no doubt been brought on by the
downturn in form seen recently.
In the past 2 summers, Chelsea have
shown a much more prudent approach
to the transfer market than during
Abramovich’s early years. For exam-
ple, last summer only Benayoun and
Ramires were signed, while players
like Ballack, Joe Cole and Deco left, no
doubt lowering the club’s wage budget
somewhat. However, even with this ap-
proach, Chelsea announced a 70 million
loss during the last financial year. With
this in mind many may question Chel-
sea’s late spending spree.
Another downside is the upcoming fi-
nancial fair play regulations that UEFA
are set to impose. These rules basically
demand that every club must balance
its income and expenditures, presum-
ably with the intention of preventing
a club from financially collapsing in
the way that Portsmouth or Leeds did.
It also means that clubs like Man City
will have to spend less on players and
effectively removes from the game the
idea of a side of ‘galacticos,’ where a
club can spend beyond what they make
to bring superstars into the team. These
rules are generally accepted as a mea-
sure to keep clubs financially healthy,
it also is seen to even out the game, al-
lowing smaller sides to be more com-
petitive. Although this is generally seen
as a good thing, with the model of Ar-
senal taken as an example, I see it as a
bad thing.
Furthermore, I am completely in fa-
vour of the steps Abramovich and An-
celotti have taken. The signing of Torres
will generate increased ticket revenue as
more fans will want to see Chelsea sport-
ing this prize asset, and shirt sales for
shirts with Torres’ name, for example,
will make the club money. In addition,
while club success is a priceless factor,
there are also huge monetary benefits.
This signing could propel Chelsea to a
higher league position and to European
success, both of which spell a huge ben-
efit for the club’s finances.
However, I feel that while every club
is now a business, having clubs regulate
themselves as such takes something
out of the game for me. Perhaps it is a
sense of romance, as club owners can
no longer part with money to assemble
a dream team that could be legendary.
While it could be argued that many
legendary teams are built from youth
players, for example Milan’s legend-
ary defence which was made up of all
Italian players (Maldini, Costacurta,
Baresi and Tassotti), 3 of whom were
from Milan’s youth system, I think few
can deny, for example, that Real Ma-
drid’s big spending at the turn of the
century, capturing Beckham, Zidane,
Ronaldo and so on caused excitement
among football fans as have Man City’s
recent big spending ways. People often
complain about transfer fees and large
wages but I find this hard to understand.
For example, the 50 million that Torres
cost and his alleged 175k a week wage
seem excessive but if he was bought for
a smaller fee and given a smaller wage,
all it would mean was more money
resting in the account of a Russian oil
baron, not better lives for the work-
ing class. At least the spending is done
in a way that provides entertainment
for millions upon millions of football
fans. If someone has a vision for their
club, and can afford to contribute these
amounts without even worrying about
making money, it seems unfair to say
that they can’t and regulate it.
Therefore, I feel that it is cynical and
sad to see the game controlled on the
grounds of finances, and even if some
may not agree, I’m quite sure that many
football fans are extremely excited to
see a world class talent like Torres fit
into the Chelsea system.
