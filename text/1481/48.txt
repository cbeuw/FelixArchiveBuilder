After a shaky start to the new year, the
Imperial Eagles Handball Club have
won the Southern University Handball
tournament in a clean sweep.
After the England Handball Associa-
tion (EHA) handed over the responsibil-
ity for the University Championships to
the British Handball Association (BHA)
a lot of changes to have been made to
rules and regulations of the only respect-
able, centrally-organised competition for
university Handball teams in the UK. In
a pathetic attempt to “develop” handball
in the country, only teams with 3 British
players or more are allowed to enter the
tournament and a plate competition is
help simultaneously for all the unreason-
ably multicultural Universities who accu-
rately reflect the democratic make-up of
Handball players in Great Britain.
Fueled by their outrage and in order to
be able to play competitive games with
other like-minded teams, 5 University
delegations came together in Leyton to
play a self-organised tournament. As all
the squads present will be represented in
this so-called “Plate Cup” in Nottingham,
it was a good indicator of what Imperial
Fencers wipe the floor
at BUCS league
is capable of this year, after they already
won some silverware in 2010.
In the first match, Imperial had to face
Oxford University, who failed to trouble
the Eagles in the development League
last season and continued to do so on this
occasion. It might have been due to that
fact that some players were forced to play
in their underwear after the player in pos-
session of the IC kit was rendered to miss
the first game on grounds of a hangover,
but Oxford seemed almost unwilling to
exert any pressure on the solid defense
and could not prevent the Eagles from
setting up countless chances in attack,
which were reliably converted, securing
the opening victory.
The next opponent was Warwick, who
did manage to narrowly defeat Imperial
in the League on two occasions last sea-
son. Motivated by the arrival of the kit
and the hung-over spectator who deliv-
ered it, the Eagles were quick to estab-
lish what should have been a comfortable
lead. However, a lack of concentration
and some truly awful goalkeeping gave
the visitors hope and even a chance to
win the game in the last minutes. Luck-

Eagles win
first title of
the season
The second and final weekend of Men’s
and Women’s, BUCS Southern Premier
League took at place at Ethos on the
28th-29th January. Going into the week-
end both Imperial teams looked strong
contenders for their respective titles, be-
ing undefeated in the first weekend. Ex-
pectations on further victories were high
and winning the league was the goal ev-
Stefan Bauer
eryone was aiming for.
Saturday started with the Men’s 1st
Team facing University of London, the
team ranked second behind IC in the
league. The sabreurs (Maiyuran Rat-
neswaran, Henry Gann, Didier Nohl-
mans, Camille van Hoffelen) gave the
team a good head start with a victory
of 45-24. Sadly followed by a defeat
for the foilists (Robert Shaw, Chris Gil-
liam, Ed Collier and Sami Start), to a
much stronger foil team, but the match
was easily decided by a victory from the
epee team (Ed Gilhead, Marcello Co-
lombino, Miles Gandolfi).
Whilst the guys finished their match,
the girls started fencing their foil match-
es. Kings University did not show up
due to illness, which meant that there
were only 3 matches to fence in each
weapon. IC’s incredibly strong women’s
