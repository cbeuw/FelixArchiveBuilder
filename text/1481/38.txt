God and his athiest penpal
Dear God,
I don’t believe in you because I believe in
science
Yours irreverently,
Atheist
----------------
Dear Atheist,
I invented science
Yours faithfully,
God
----------------
Dear God,
How can that be true? The bible is simply lit-
tered with scientific inaccuracies. How do you
propose getting two of every species onto a
boat? Or what about the fact that you created
human kind from dust and a rib. A rib!? I mean
come on!
----------------
Dear Atheist,
Of course the bible is littered with scientific in-
accuracies, as it was written by stupid humans. I
had fuck all to do with that piece of shit. Frankly
it’s an insult to the amount of work I put into
formulating DNA or the unified field theory.
----------------
Dear God,
So if the bible is wrong, which religion is right?
Oh, and do you mind explaining the unified field
theory?
----------------
Dear Atheist,
What makes you think any of the religions are
right? And you don’t even understand how
wave-particle duality works, so you’re defi-
nitely not going to understand the unified field
theory. Do you know how fucking hilarious the
Schrodinger equation is!? Seriously, me and my
mates had a right good laugh at that. You guys
are fucking retarded
----------------
Dear God,
I hardly think we’re retarded. Quantum mechan-
ics has pushed scientific thinking to the limits
and opened countless doors to innumerable pos-
sibilities. Probability is intrinsic to the universe
and the way it works.
----------------
Dear Atheist,
I’m not going to design something using prob-
ability because that’s retarded. You don’t design
a bridge and just hope that it stays up. You use
the right materials with rigorous engineering.
Unless we’re talking about the Indian Common-
wealth games! HAhahahaha, am I right? Am I
right? High five?
----------------
Dear God,
So you’re a determinist?
PS: I didn’t find your joke funny
----------------
Dear Atheist,
I don’t find your jokes funny.
PS What’s a determinist?
Dude, that guy must be a fucking King in bed. Check out that beard!
SexyOsama69
I heard it was inspired by the stu-
dent protests in London
Dear God,
You don’t know what a determinist is? I thought
you’re supposed to know everything
----------------
Dear Atheist,
I have a life. I don’t spend my whole time lis-
tening to you boring twats trying to deconstruct
what is actually a very simple universe. You
should see my mate Xnshyfgewiyl’s universe.
It’s way more intricate than mine. He wins Mr
universe competitions all the time. I really hate
Xnshyfgewiyl.
----------------
Dear God,
How do you pronounce Xnshyfgewiyl?
----------------
Dear Atheist,
That is the best way to spell it in your rudimen-
tary alphabet. You only have one set of vocal
chords, whilst I have inifinity.
----------------
Dear God,
Infinity is not a finite number
----------------
Dear Atheist,
Yeah it is
----------------
Dear God,
If you supposedly exist, why is there so much
suffering in the world?
----------------
Dear Atheist,
It’s a joke. Lol
----------------
Dear God,
It’s not very funny!
Dear Atheist,
Yeah it is
----------------
Dear God,
Unless you’re going to give us some insight
into how the universe works, you’re pretty use-
less. You might as well not exist.
----------------
Dear Atheist,
Well if you can’t believe in something as sim-
ple as a divine being like myself, you’re hardly
going to understand how the universe works
----------------
Dear God,
Alright then, prove that you exist! Turn the sky
green, make us all fly, bring Shakespeare back
from the dead
----------------
Dear Atheist,
Why do I have to prove myself to you? You
know what? Fuck it! Build me a fucking ark
right now and get every single species on
board. Yeah, even the fish! And the insects and
the bacteria! You’re pissing me off and I’m go-
ing to flood the whole world.
----------------
Dear God,
Oh yeah? And how are you going to do that?
----------------
Dear Atheist,
Well I’ve already started melting the ice caps.
I’ll just blow up a few volcanoes and generate
some earthquakes and landslides, which will
send some fuck off tsunamis at you. And if that
doesn’t work, I’ll just send in an asteroid. It’s not
hard. Christ! Noah didn’t ask so many questions

I heard Kanye West played a se-
cret gig at Mubarak’s house
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
I heard the protestors want
Mubarak to step down, and Kanye
West to step up
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
I heard Kanye West is the reincar-
nation of the Egyptian god Anubis
The_Cleggomatortrontown <3
Oh dear. The situation in Egypt
just keeps getting worse
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
I heard that this is just a warm-up
act for Kanye West’s set on the
pyramids
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Yeah, and they’re protesting that
they couldn’t get tickets
The_Cleggomatortrontown <3
I don’t think Kanye West had an-
ything to do with this
SUPERACEGORTHEROAR87
I heard that Kanye West believes
that Egypt is actually just a
conspiracy
SexyOsama69
Egypt isn’t a conspiracy. It’s a
state of mind
