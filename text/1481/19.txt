COMMENT
W
here do you live? A
simple enough ques-
tion, in appearance.
I’ve been asked it a
lot this year. Meet-
ing an endless stream of new people
from various countries makes for a large
number of introductions. After you’ve
said hello to the fifteenth German girl
at the party, whose name you’ve already
forgotten, the quasi-scripted question-
and-answer session begins.
“So, where do you live?” Piece of
cake, you think, I live right next to that
big avenue in the city cent.. - wait. Did
she mean here, or which country do
I usually live in? Or even where I’m
from?
Ah. Well, it doesn’t matter any more;
the 3-minute silence accompanying my
thought process made her lose interest.
I’m sure that pitcher of sangria over
there would be happy to hear my answer.
But what would my answer have been?
As a student, you’ll have at least two
places to call home; obviously there’s
the place with the draughty windows
and dodgy Ikea furniture you’ve oc-
cupied for the past six months, but
there’s also your parents’ house, which
is always a pleasure to go back to (for,
say, the first 48 hours). Being on a year
abroad just adds another country to the
mix, and increases your chances of not
being understood when trying to answer
the question.
Does it actually matter? Not really.
I think the question of where you live
has become irrelevant. The internet
and cheap air travel means that you can
know what’s going on anywhere in the
world as if you were actually there. If
you want to, you can conceivably get
there in less than a day and for less than
a thousand pounds.
All right, a thousand pounds is a lot of
money. Maybe the entire world is still
out of the reach of your average Impe-
rial student. On a smaller scale, Europe
is your oyster. Got fifty quid to spare?
Fancy a change of scenery? Get yourself
a Ryanair ticket to Rome, or EasyJet it
to Prague.
Distances have practically vanished
between countries; if you’re travelling
inside the E.U. you barely notice any
borders at all. You could be in a different
country every six months if you wanted
to. Naturally, in these conditions, the
concept of home starts to blur.
This is exacerbated by the internet:
thanks to Facebook and Skype, I al-
most get the impression I’m still living
in London sometimes. Events, banter,
gossip and even the results of the IC
Fencing team make their way towards
me through the ‘intertubes’. The ubiqui-
tous tweet lets me know what a friend
is thinking, or even gauge the mood of
Londoners, at any given time.
The world is definitely getting small-
er, and I can only see that as being a
good thing. As people travel more, and
see what life is like in other countries;
as people get used to reading opinions
from halfway around the globe, maybe
people will start to cooperate more, and
with more meaning.
In practical terms, there isn’t much
difference between a student flat in Hel-
sinki and one in Barcelona. So, in an-
swer to the question, I don’t know where
I live. I’ll still have my friends and fam-
ily close by wherever I choose to be, and
that’s what counts to me.
Although I’m just happy to have cho-
sen a place with a beach.
I
f popular culture has taught me
anything (and I like to think
it has), it is that we are most
likely to perish as a species in
a thermonuclear fire-storm or
a zombie pandemic. Though radically
different, these apocalypses involve
a great deal of mass panic before the
dying starts. As such, there are themes
common to both that may just dissuade
booking any long-term holidays.
I’m sure there is some kind of national
information service for these things but
I think most people will get wind of
things beforehand. Those hard-wired
into the blogosphere and interwebs
will pick it up, like any other news, on
Twitter and Facebook first – “#OMG-
ZOMBIES is trending on Twitter. Find
out why.” Those of us with one foot in
the present will receive a pertinent text
message from a loved one – “Fallout im-
minent. In bunker. Bring biccies. Luv =)
x.” As such, there will already be micro-
panics occurring before the reality hits
BBC News 24, but only once Huw Ed-
wards is handed the copy-sheet, the real
panic will begin.
Feral mobs killing each other over a
crate of tinned peaches is quite an Amer-
icanised idea. I’m not sure how well it
will translate across the Atlantic. Of
course, there will be a rush for all canned
foods and bottled water but we will still
queue and pay as is proper. There will be
traffic chaos on Kensington High Street
as all the yummy–mummies of Not-
ting Hill swarm the Whole Foods Mar-
ket, ignoring all the corner–shops they
passed on the way. The end of the world
is no time to start developing bad hab-
its. Maybe, if we’re in a real pinch, we
won’t ask for cash–back. The panic will
be evident however in a glut of foot–tap-
ping and sighs of exasperation.
With the last ever weekly shop done,
people will go out looting. This will be a
competitive affair; people will only loot
once their neighbours are home, so they
know what they have to beat. Admitted-
ly, surpassing the Jones’ plasma-screen
HDTV becomes academic once the
EMP/bloodthirsty horde hits the power
plants. Imperial students are more prac-
tical beings. They will take as many
tankards as possible from the Union Bar
– the beer, however, they will leave.
Then comes the moment of realising
the answers to “If you could get away
with anything, what would you do?”
With possibly hours left in existence,
the idea of consequences quietly dis-
solves and traditional morality caves in
on itself. To my female readers, I give a
warning: arm yourselves, as heavily and
by any means possible. Total annihila-
tion can turn people into desperate crea-
tures...as if the Imperial student body
wasn’t desperate enough already. Think-
ing of it, as an addendum, ladies, buy a
safe for your calculators too.
At this point, our potential fates di-
verge. In the case of nuclear holocaust,
anyone caught outside of Blackett is
dead. The end. An undead plague is
more perfidious, and there is a strong
possibility of survivors for several
weeks at least. Blackett, Queen’s Tower
and Charing Cross Hospital are all po-
tential sites to hole up in, situated in
trendy boroughs of West London, part-
furnished, perfect for students and flat-
sharers. My advice here is to avoid the
Tube. London Underground is not re-
nowned for its reliability; do you think
things will improve after an apocalypse?
The Circle Line, at least, will invariably
be down.
Now, this vision of the future may
seem dystopic to you but I consider it
a win-win situation. I’m an optimist.
Firstly, if I’m among the countless mil-
lions dead, I won’t be too bothered that
I missed out on the looting. And if I sur-
vive, if I’m one of the few who have lost
everything I hold dear, at least I’m alive
and I have my health.
Until the radiation sickness or zombie
virus get me.
Apocalypse Now... please?

world is no time to

habits”

definitely getting
smaller, and I can
only see that as
being a good thing”
Letter to the Editor
Dude, where’s my country? Dear Sirs,
While reading last week’s com-
ment piece “Science doesn’t
play by its own rules” I couldn’t
help but wonder if the author
hadn’t confused the scientific
method as an idea and fallible
human culture. She makes the
observation that a dispropor-
tionate amount of scientists
are male and concludes that
the scientific method itself is
to blame.
Obviously it is in nobody’s
interests if half the human
population are excluded from
science but I feel that it is ac-
tually arbitrary cultural norms
that are to blame.
Indeed the march of pro-
gress, partly achieved by sci-
ence, could been seen as the
cause of greater gender equal-
ity. Historically science has
demonstrated and popularised
the power of reason and evi-
dence. It has encouraged peo-
ple to throw out dogma, tradi-
tion and authority as a route to
knowledge.
If you think it’s difficult to be
a woman in science now, imag-
ine if your male counterparts
stopped you because “It’s tra-
ditional that the woman stays
at home” or “For God made
Adam first, and afterwards he
made Eve.”
Feminists should be using
reason to our advantage.
Yours,
Jakov Marelic
The author responds:
I don’t believe that I did sug-
gest that the scientific method
was to blame. In fact, I specifi-
cally said that I wasn’t talking
about the scientific method.
The article was mostly meant to
talk about Bacon’s idea of the
idols, which is a separate issue
to what science has or hasn’t
achieved over the last few
years. I tried to make it clear
that I thought cultural influenc-
es had been the reason women
hadn’t been able to be as suc-
cessful in science. My point was
that the perception of science
as completely rational had held
the scientific community back
from counteracting the lack of
women in science..
