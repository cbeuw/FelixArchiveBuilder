Scorpio
This week you will do exactly as this
Horoscope tells you. Rip out a single
page of the newspaper. Scrunch it up
tightly. Now put it in your mouth. Now
take a photo. Email it to your mother
with the subject: “I’m an impressionable
cunt”. Post a screenshot on Facebook.
THE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS

Horoscopes
Aries
This week you start your fart collection.
At first you’re content with gathering
yours in little jars, but that’s not enough.
You take it to the next level, murder peo-
ple and use a portable vaccum cleaner to
gather the air as your victims shit them-
selves after dying.
Taurus
This week you go for a shit and the
massive dump that just came out of you
comes to life. It decides to crawl up back
inside you in a sporadic penetrating mo-
tion. Long story short: You get ass-raped
by your own shit. Also for some reason
you don’t try to stop it... Weird eh?
Gemini
This week you’re riding your bike and
while you go through one of the bumps
the seat goes a little bit too far in your
ass. You suddenly realize why you kind
of walk funny. Your childhood flashes
past your eyes. No, Uncle, no! You get
distracted and wipeout under a bus...
Cancer
This week you realize that you’re not the
person that you were back in the ‘Good
ol’ days” – you can’t handle your drink
anymore and your sex life is frankly
non-existent. Yep, your life sucks! But
hey, we all go through it. It’s just what
happens when you turn 12.
Leo
This week you get tea bagged by Lady
Gaga. You find out the truth about her
sex and when she’s done raping you, you
run to tell all your friends. After hear-
ing the news from your excited self they
turn their backs in disgust. You’re a sick
person...
Virgo
This week you realize how having
Pokemon would improve your boyfriend
Pkills. Using Pikachu as a taser while
Beedrill and Rhydon take turns ramming
their high rotation dildos into that guy
who turned gay a week after breaking up
with you. Accept it, you turned him.
Libra
This week you watch the peaceful scenes
in Egypt and realise that our student
protestors are fucking knob ends. Then
things turn ugly in Egypt and you real-
ise that otherwise peaceful people can be
provoked. Either way, I blame the N.U.S.
What? It’s perfectly reasonable!!!
Sagittarius
This week you and your boyfriend are
doing role-play. The theme is Oliver
Twist. While doing doggystyle, you
look at him sexily and say, “Please Sir,
may I have some more?” He replies:
“MOOARE?! MOOOOOOARE?!” You
nod. “No! I’ve err, already cum... Sorry!”
Capricorn
This week you go for a piss in one of
those urinals and you find yourself
sandwiched by two guys. You realize
they are both staring down at your
station and something’s wrong... You’re
a woman and you are smashed off your
face! Your photo will be up next week.
Aquarius
This week the Union shuts down Pisces
because some ****** (oh yeah, count the
asterisks, what slur is it?) complains to
the ********** College (oh yeah, count
the asterisks...) because the following
word was printed: **. Oh yeah, count
the... You know what to do.
Pisces
This week you
Modern Egyptian Mummies
Extremely Disappointing...
DRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK
Guys are under so much pressure ‘to pull’ nowadays. But this guy knows what going out is REALLY about.
Ending the night in a pile of garbage. I salute you sir!
