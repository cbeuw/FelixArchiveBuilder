A depleted ICUAFC 1s team made the
long journey down to Canterbury for
the second time this season; a trek so
long that Frodo and Sam would have
called it quits once they had inevita-
bly run out of lembas bread. Amjad,
Wedemeyer and Cherif Jnr were no-
table absentees, and with Murphy
(Imperial’s resident wildlife expert)
in the Library and captain Woodhead
out with a broken nail, the team had
a fresh new look to it. Thomas and
Dabbagh were called up from the 2s
to make their ﬁrst appearances for
the 1s this season, whilst new recruit
Jones was looking to impress. Impe-
rial started the day top of the BUCS
league on 9 points from a possible 12,
with Canterbury in joint 2nd, making
at least a draw imperative. Minds wan-
dered back to 2 months before where
a defensive masterclass allowed Impe-
rial to advance to the 3rd round of the
BUCS cup on penalties, something
that Canterbury were sure to remem-
ber.
The journey to Mordor, I mean
Canterbury, took the best part of ﬁve
months, and upon arrival most players
had forgotten the purpose of the jour-
ney. Having had their memories re-
freshed, a warm up took place for the
purpose of getting accustomed to the
interesting and dynamic terrain. The
pitch was composed of approximately
15 parts water to one part grass which
would serve to level the, ironically,
uneven playing ﬁeld; a gale force wind
added to the interesting conditions.
With Murphy absent, much of the in-
teresting ﬂora and fauna on the side
of the pitch went unnoticed, much to
the disappointment of approximately
no one. Due to the aforementioned
changes in personnel, Hill was moved
to centre back with Cherif Snr, with
Thomas given the nod at right back
and Nielsen completing the back row.
Tim ‘Smithy’ Beasley was alongside
Jones in midﬁeld with Maizonnier
and Toﬁs on the ﬂanks. Robinson and
Bjorkstrand started up front together,
in what has recently been a partner-
ship more fruitful than the Garden of
Eden.
Imperial lost the toss and thus were
designated to spend the ﬁrst half in
the deep end of the pool (pitch); a
combination of bogginess (akin to
the Dead Marshes, North-West of
Mordor, minus the randomly strewn
dead war victims), a prominent head
wind and Apollo’s mocking rays of
light would make for a tricky ﬁrst 45
minutes. From the oﬀ Imperial were
made to soak up pressure in precisely
the same way that the pitch didn’t soak
up water. Robinson was lively up top,
making intelligent runs despite the
abuse received from the Canterbury
staﬀ and subs, many of whom had the
unique accolade of having IQs small-
er than their shoe size. Although the
conditions favoured Canterbury few
clear cut chances were created by ei-
ther team; that was until Canterbury
decided that what they really wanted
was to let in a goal. A Canterbury goal
kick was taken short to the defender
who, in a surprising turn of events,
played a sumptuous through ball to
Bjorkstrand. Bjorkstrand rounded the
keeper before placing the ball into the
bottom corner with his left foot. The
lack of celebration from Imperial was
a textbook example of how the team
fully expected him to score. His strike
drew him level with goalkeeper Gar-
ner for number of goals scored for IC-
UAFC this season.
The goal seemed to kick start Can-
terbury who applied sustained pres-
sure for the next 10 minutes. With half
time approaching, a Canterbury play-
er, recently nominated for the Fallon
D’Floor award, went down under the
mere presence of right back Thomas.
The referee, who up until this point
had been anonymous, decided this
was the chance to kick start his act-
ing career and took centre stage by
awarding a penalty. The penalty was
dispatched, with Garner remaining
ﬁxated in the mud like some kind of
hapless Medusa victim (or maybe like
those trolls in the Hobbit when Gan-
dalf splits the rock and they get turned
to stone by sunlight; basically some-
thing like that). The ﬁrst half ended,
but not before Jones managed to ac-
robatically head a Canterbury corner
over his own bar from a yard out, even
managing to draw praise from some of
the opposition.
Half time gave Imperial a chance to
catch their breath. At this point a draw
was widely considered a good score,
given the conditions. It was widely
agreed that the advantages of being at
the other end second half would pro-
vide an excellent opportunity to get a
win.
The eﬀect of changing halves was
instantly noticeable and Imperial
started to dominate. Not long after
the restart, a cynical foul on Nielsen
allowed Hill the opportunity to ﬂoat
a sumptuous ball through to Jones
who marked his debut with a Jack
Nicklaus-esque chip over the keeper;
2-1 Imperial. Imperial were as des-
perate to get a third goal as Odysseus
was to once again reach his homeland
of Ithica after the battle of Troy but,
ultimately, chances were few and far
between. Bjorkstrand, with his taste
of glory (which is in no way foreign to
him) whetted by his ﬁrst, nearly scored
his second by attempting to deﬂect a
free-kick into his own goal, but Gar-
ner managed to tip it onto the post.
Dabbagh replaced Thomas midway
through the second period to provide
a pair of fresh legs and clean knees.
By this point the referee had become
relatively apocryphal, something that
he very quickly changed. A long ball
played through to the Canterbury
striker produced no oﬀside ﬂag from
sub Thomas who, correctly, waited
until the opposition player touched it.
The striker ﬁnished it bottom corner
whilst the referee ignored the oﬀside
ﬂag, much to the frustration of the
Imperial players. This display of ques-
tionable sportsmanship especially
upset Hill, who was irate and then
calmed down and then became irate
again, a cycle that repeated itself mul-
tiple times (“much like a Polymerase
Chain Reaction” – Amjad). The sense
of injustice spurned on Imperial who
Not drowning but waving?
Henry Garner Sports Writer were looking dangerous on the wings
with Toﬁs and Maizonnier working
hard and Nielsen joining in a num-
ber of attacks. A corner towards the
end of the game evaded everyone and
somehow did not end up in the back
of the net, punishment for failure to
gamble at the back stick.
The full time whistle blew leav-
ing Imperial with mixed emotions; 2
points dropped seemed more appro-
priate than one point gained. Ulti-
mately the draw was enough to main-
tain top spot in the league at the half
way stage of the league and may yet
prove to be vital point come the end
of the season.
Garner was voted man of the match,
increasing his lead at the top of Impe-
rial’s very own Fantasy Football but
Jones made a very promising debut
and, despite the result, the team put
in one of the better performances of
the season. The journey back is ongo-
ing, and the team are expected back
shortly before the summer ball.
Football tackles Canterbury on less than ideal terrain, with mixed results...
