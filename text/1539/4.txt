NSS Response: what has changed
he National Student Sur-
vey (NSS) is completed
by every ﬁnal year under-
graduate student across
the country and has been
run since 2005 by HEFCE, an organisa-
tion responsible for public funding of
English universities. Being the only way
to assess student experience through-
out their time in university on a nation-
al scale, it plays a crucial role in univer-
sity ranking process and is widely held
responsible for the poor performance
in the Sunday Times League Table for
2012 entry, where Imperial lost 11 posi-
tions.
Following the NSS 2011 results,
the Union President at the time Scott
Heath, Deputy President (Education)
Jason Parmer and the Representative
Coordinator came up with a report,
which provided 35 recommendations
on how to improve student experi-
ence at Imperial. A year later current
Union President Paul Beaumont and
Deputy President (Education) Doug
Hunt report on the progress made fol-
lowing those recommendations, as well
as coming up with new ones to further
improve student satisfaction. Accord-
ing to them, “Imperial College Union
takes the NSS results seriously because
we believe our students should be satis-
ﬁed with the world class education they
receive.’ They also note that ‘potential
talented students should also not be
deterred from applying to Imperial by
looking at our national league table
rankings, brought down by the NSS re-
sults.”
Some of the suggestions made by
the Union were fully embodied by the
College. When it comes to reward-
ing innovation in teaching there have
been great improvements with the
Union providing funding for a teach-
ing awards system run by students. The
Union plans to extend the awards to
include research supervisors since over
20% of Imperial’s students are research
postgraduates. Another success of the
past year is the campaign ‘You Said,
We Did’
, which has been embraced by
the College. Nevertheless, the Union
feels that “further work is still neces-
sary to completely convince students
that the College takes SOLE seriously.”
Furthermore, this year the Union Presi-
dent and Deputy President (Education)
were invited to become members of the
Strategic Education Committee, which
determines overall education strategies
across the College, and this allows them
to become more engaged with decision
making.
All of these have possibly contributed
to the improved NSS score in teaching,
allowing Imperial to reach the national
average. Nevertheless, a few other rec-
ommendations could be followed to
further improve this aspect. For exam-
ple, whilst staﬀ are required to under-
take courses when they start lecturing,
further training is not always compulso-
ry and varies between departments. The
Union suggests that “baseline standards
should be enforced across College, sup-
plemented with frequent reviews.”
As for ‘Assessment and Feedback’
,
which is still College’s weakest section,
with the satisfaction rates nearly 10%
below the national average, ranking Im-
perial 143rd out of 168 HEIs, very few
recommendations have been followed.
This includes stricter deadlines to en-
sure prompt feedback, clearer marking
criteria and weighting of each piece of
coursework and exam, as well as mak-
ingtheassignmentsrelevantratherthan
giving work ‘just for the sake of it’
. How-
ever, the Union feels that ICT projects
such as ‘custom’ systems, which could
act as an alternative to Blackboard,
could be used to improve the feedback
and assessment programmes. Moreo-
ver, this year Deputy President (Educa-
tion) and Deputy President (Welfare)
became members of Representation
& Welfare Board, which will help to
“inform the student representatives of
what is happening in higher education
at a College and national level.”
When it comes to “Academic Sup-
port”
, the Union feels that this section
has been addressed the least regarding
the recommendations made last year
– buddies, moms and dads and other
similar schemes don’t work well, result-
ing in lack of mutual academic support
between diﬀerent year groups. Conse-
quently there is neither a feeling of com-
munity nor academic succession, which
are particularly invaluable for those
who are just starting their degree. The
Union suggests that the departments
organise social events so that ‘parents’
and ‘children’ could meet up.
As for personal tutors, there are dif-
ferent approaches within the university,
making it diﬃcult to determine a tutor’s
responsibilities. Furthermore, there is
no proper feedback system to see how
thetutorsaredoing.Thismeansthatthe
dissatisﬁed students, who are not likely
to complain to the Senior Tutor, are
never spotted. Furthermore, the Union
feels that tutors should monitor the ac-
ademic progress of their charges more
closely and that the meetings should be
timetabled and probably should take
With the NSS in full swing this year, Yulia Negreskul sees where
progress was made and not made on last year’s suggestions
Unfortunately, it has not been imple-
mented. Furthermore, the Union feels
that ICT could be used to improve the
rates of SOLE and NSS by pop-ups on
College computers, for example, but
this is something still to be seen. Nev-
ertheless, when it came to the Library
and the Union campaign to challenge
unfair journal pricing, the College fully
supported them.
In addition to the 35 made last year,
three new recommendations were
added and these include training of
Graduate Teaching Assistants to im-
prove their feedback quality as well as
‘best practice’ reports for each depart-
ment, which reﬂect on the changes
they’ve made. Furthermore, it has been
suggested that the College invests more
into the communication with students,
as it will help to resolve many issues
where students feel out of touch with
the university.
Even though most recommendations
haven’t been fully embraced by the Col-
lege, some positive changes are seen as a
result of these suggestions, which might
well have contributed to the ranking for
2013 entry where Imperial has moved 6
positions in comparison to the previous
year, making Imperial 8th.
College were contacted for comment
and replied: “Feedback from Imperial
College Union, both in the form of its
NSS Response and through sabbaticals’
regular meetings with senior staﬀ, is al-
ways taken seriously and helps inform
improvements the College makes. In-
dividual departments have prepared
action plans focused on enhancing the
student experience they oﬀer – includ-
ing looking at elements such as teach-
ing approaches and assessment and
feedback.”
time in a less formal
environment, further
encouraging commu-
nity spirit, which is that
valued by the NSS.
Another problem
that hasn’t been ad-
dressed in the past
year is poor timeta-
bling where sometimes
students living across
London need to come
in only for one lecture.
Moreover, last year the
Union suggested mov-
ing timetable to a dif-
ferent software such as
Optime or at least mak-
ing it synchronize by
default with calendars
such as Outlook and
iCal, to make the track-
ing of changes easy. Un-
fortunately this recom-
mendation also hasn’t been taken up.
Major course changes are still not dis-
cussed with the student body, who are
often not told about them, as one bio-
chemistry student noted: “Students are
generally not consulted or informed of
signiﬁcant changes to the course that
directly aﬀect them, or informed at the
very last minute.” The Union highlights
how important that is to avoid the sce-
nario seen with the organization of Life
sciences, which “attracted mass bad
publicity.”
“Learning resources” is by far the
most successful of all the sections
for Imperial with satisfaction at 92%,
which is 10% above the sector average.
Regardless of great eﬀorts of some de-
partments to provide lecture record-
ings and podcasts, it was suggested last
year to allocate a few members of staﬀ
to e-learning to improve communica-
tion between ICT and the department.
