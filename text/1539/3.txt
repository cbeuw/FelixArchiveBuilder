Now the big question: how can
you help? And how can you learn
more about the situation in Syria?
Everything can be answered by
two simple words: Action Syria.
Action Syria is a student lead
initiative, backed by the Union at
Imperial to raise awareness and
humanise the civil unrest in Syria.
The organisers want to demon-
strate solidarity and express that
Syria is being remembered by
Imperial College. The campaign
runs from the 1st to the 22nd
February. Detailed information
is outlined on the website www.
actionsyria.com. The website is
packed with information, so make
sure you visit it. The crisis in Syria
was bought about by a few simple
words. Do you know what they
are? (Don’t worry if you don’t as
they’re on the website). There will
also be a lecture by experts on the
humanitarian crisis on the 12th of
February so keep your eyes wide
open for that, it is one not to be
missed. Additionally, there is a full
timeline of events explaining what
has happened over the last two
years. Syria is a war-torn country,
where hundreds die every day;
this campaign is a great way for
youtohelpmakeadifference(and
wasn’t that one of your New Year
resolutions?).
The website also has a link to the
Avaaz petition, the one that wants
the Syrian Students to be able to
continue with their studies in the
UK. So if you want to help out,
please sign it.
The organisers succinctly ex-
plained the motivation for this
campaign, “we want to actively
portray that ‘we have not forgot-
ten’, the website and social media
is a way of raising awareness and
to humanise what can so easily
become statistic after statistic. It’s
a campaign which also aims to
raise funds for medicine, provide
organised information about the
situation and enables everyone to
help out in any way possible.”
There is also a Facebook page
that gives daily updates: https://
www.facebook.com/ActionSyria.
Whether or not you are a tweeter,
be sure to check out #ActionSyria.
So get informed and get involved.

Action Syria
The government has been urged
to show clemency and help Syrian
students who are at the risk of be-
ing ejected from their university and
deported from the UK. There are
approximately 670 Syrian students
studying in the UK, approximately
80% are on postgraduate courses. The
lack of funding means they face being
removed from their courses. Mansour
Shaeban, a former Computing student
at Bolton was expelled last for not be-
ing able to receive money from his
family to pay tuition. Many of these
students were funded by Syria’s higher
education ministry, which has ceased
awarding grants. Other students have
had their fees suspended for standing
against the Syrian regime. The Syrian
embassy in London processes the pay-
ments, but it has come to a halt, being
left with just a skeleton of staﬀ; fur-
thermore, international sanctions are
in place on the country’s banks. Con-
sequently, self-funded students are
unable to receive money from their
family in Syria.
Last October, the UK Borders Agen-
cy announced temporary concessions
for Syrian nationals, enabling visa
extensions or the switching of visa
categories without leaving the UK;
however, this is yet to be addressed
as these concessions will expire on 15
March. Many students currently face
an uncertain future; some have had
their student status suspended, while
others will not be able to graduate till
their fees have been paid. Without
funding, many students are struggling
to make ends meet for their living
costs.
Liam Burns, President of the NUS,
commented: “The situation in Syria
is devastating enough without uni-
versities turning their backs on those
currently studying in the UK. What
we urgently need to see is every Syr-
ian student is given support when ﬁ-
nances aren’t forthcoming so they can
continue their studies. This has to be
the least the UK can do considering
the tragic circumstances of the con-
ﬂict in Syria.”
Imperial College London currently
has ten students who have Syria list-
ed as their primary citizenship. The
International Oﬃce said that no stu-
dents have approached them about
the situation at this time.
When asked about what the College
would do to help students, a College
spokesperson said: “Any student who
experiences an unexpected change in
their ﬁnancial circumstances, includ-
ing tuition fees, can contact the Stu-
dent Hub, the College Tutors or the
Union’s Student Advice Centre for
information and advice. The College
Hardship Fund is also available to help
students experiencing unexpected
ﬁnancial hardship. The Fund cannot
be used to assist
with tuition fee
payment but can
help with living
costs. Students
can ﬁnd further
information by

ac.uk/studentfi-
nance/current-
students/hard-
shipfund .”
Avaaz, an on-
line pressure
group, have set
up a petition
demanding the
Foreign Oﬃce
assist Syrian
students, as was
done in 2011 for
the Libyan stu-
dents during the
Libyan revolu-
tion. The peti-
tion currently
has over 46,000
s i g n a t u r e s .
Avazz is appeal-
ing for the gov-
ernment ministers to step in: William
Hague, the Foreign Secretary; Vince
Cable, Minister for Business, Innova-
tion and Skills; and David Willetts,
Universities Minister, to ensure the
Syrian students continue their stud-
ies in the UK. They have tracked many
students who have been expelled from
their courses, while there are others
that could be expelled as they are un-
able to pay their fees. When removed
from their courses, they run into dif-
ﬁculties with their visas and face de-
portation to war areas. If they have
any connections to the opposition,
they will be arrested on their return.
Luis Morago, the campaign direc-
tor for Avaaz, commented: “The UK
beats the drum for action on Syria
but has done little to help hundreds
of Syrian students in Britain who face
being thrown oﬀ their courses. The
UK government must intervene and
ensure they can continue their studies
in Britain.”
Two weeks ago a statement was re-
leased from David Willetts, the uni-
versities minister, in association with
the FCO and Treasury; he said that the
government is working with the Uni-
versities UK Higher Education Inter-
national Unit to identify ways to assist
students. He said: “The government
appreciates the potential challenges
faced by students living in the UK who
wish to receive money from countries
that are subject to ﬁnancial sanctions
and looks favourably on licence appli-
cations to enable the ﬁnancing of edu-
cation. All applications are considered
on a case by case basis and nationality
is not a factor in any licensing deci-
sion. Syrian students within the UK
wishing to receive money from or via a
designated Syrian entity should apply
to the Treasury by email for a licence,
setting out the amount and purpose of
the transaction as well as the individu-
als, organisations and banks involved.”
The British Council has set up a
hardship fund to support the living
costs to fund the 100 Syrian scholars
who are studying in the UK on the
main Syrian government scholarship.
Certain universities are allowing the
deferral of fees and providing sup-
port through hardship funds, allowing
students to continue with their study.
The Council for Assisting refugee
Academics has been providing help to
academics in danger for 80 years, has
also launched an appeal to help aca-
demics facing hardship.
Christian Gilmore, a campaigner for
the Syrian students, said “it is in the
interest of the British government to
help these people and to follow up in
its commitment. They may not be able
to solve the international problem
right now but helping Syrian students
is 100% in their control.
Husam Helmi, 32, who is ﬁnish-
ing his PhD in economics at Lon-
don Brunel University, said he had
to take odd jobs to care for his wife
and daughter. Between study, unpaid
university fees and the news from his
home in Dareia, near Damascus in
Syria, he said the pressure, was unre-
lenting. “We’re struggling,” Mr Helmi
said. “We are struggling with more
than one problem. They want us to
solve our own problems, but to ﬁnd
a job, ﬁnish our studies and deal with
our emotional situation is very diﬃ-
cult”.
