This week, the Union opened nomi-
nations for the upcoming elections
for its part- and full-time positions.
The Big Elections 2013, as the Union
are publicising them, are this year the
stage for 56 people to be chosen to
represent Imperial students in their
respective capacities.
Nominations opened on the 4th
February, and at the time of writing
many people have already been nomi-
nated according to the “Big Elections”
website. The fact that there are already
ﬁve people who have been nominated
for ICU President also shows that the
competition is hotting-up.
This should not deter any would be
candidates, who still have until 23.59
on the night of the 3rd of March to go
online and nominate themselves. For
everybody to get involved in, the actu-
al voting opens at 12:00 on Friday the
8th March and closes a week later on
the 15th March. The ﬁnal results will
be announced at the Results Party in
Metric the same evening.

A paper from the College Secretary
reveals that Imperial College’s un-
dergraduate application rate has in-
creased on last year against a backdrop
of falling applicant rates to UK univer-
sities across the board. Postgraduate
application numbers, however, are at
present lower than last year.
The number of students applying
to study undergraduate courses at
Imperial for 2013 entry is up by 4.2%
compared to last year’s 2012 entry sta-
tistics. This is more signiﬁcant against
the trend in the UK, with last year’s
UCAS data revealing a 7.4% drop in
application rates in a year.
The cause for the drop has been at-
tributed to combination of various
eﬀects including ripples from the tui-
tion fees rise and population eﬀects.
The main group causing the fall is UK
applicants who, in the UCAS data,
had an even greater 8.7% drop. Ap-
parently, according to the National
Undergraduate applications
for next year rise while
postgraduates fall
Oﬃce for Statistics, the number of 18
year olds in the UK population is fall-
ing; the drop was at the rate of 1.4%
last year. Imperial College has a large
number of overseas and international
students, with ~30% from outside the
EU, so would be less aﬀected than
most other universities.
Of course, Imperial is still an attrac-
tive prospect. The is still high in the
league tables and is a relatively well
known university, so it may be that it
is continuing to attract students even
when universities seem to be a less
credible choice.
In contrast to this, the postgradu-
ate ﬁgures are down on last year. It is
still early in the recruitment cycle, and
so this ﬁgure is not yet concrete. The
Management Board have responded
by requesting monthly updates on the
situation with fresh ﬁgures.
