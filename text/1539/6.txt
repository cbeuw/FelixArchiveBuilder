6 FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY
The 111th
Bottle Match
The biggest event in the Royal School
of Mines’ calendar is once again upon
us. On the 22 and 23 February, the
second oldest varsity match after the
Oxbridge boat-race will take the stage
for the 111th year. The varsity is be-
tween the RSM and the Camborne
School of Mines based in Cornwall,
and is ultimately decided with a game
of rugby that concludes a two day cat-
alogue of sports.
The RSM and CSM began this
sporting rivalry in December of 1906,
playing rugby against each other to
determine which prestigious institu-
tion had greater athletic dominance.
20 years later, the trophy was born
after students of the RSM stole a 3ft
Bottle from a Bass Brewery lorry and
was decorated with the crests of the
two mining schools. The winner of
the rugby match gets to take home the
Bottle for the year, some of the more
observant of you may have noticed
such a bottle proudly displayed behind
the Union Bar for the past two years.
In fact out of the last 17 Bottle Match-
es, the Royal School of Mines has won
a respectable 14.
Last year, the RSM had a very con-
vincing win against Camborne of 22-
0; let’s hope they bring us more of a
challenge this year. Despite the rugby
being the climax of the weekend and
the ultimate decider of victory, the two
mining schools now challenge each
other in golf, netball, squash, hockey
and football. Each of which has its
own trophy and glory presented to the
winning institution. The RSM men’s
hockey team will be looking for their
ﬁrst victory since 2008, and the ladies
will be looking to overcome CSM for
the second time in three years. The
football team is looking stronger than
ever, and after holding CSM to a 0-0
draw last year will be looking to capi-
talise on their home soil. Squash was
settled last year with a 5-0 victory to
RSM, and golf was drawn at 2-2, but
both RSM teams are conﬁdent of

vandalism. Everyone taking part in
our events is aware of the negative ef-
fects that this kind of behaviour could
bring to Imperial, the medical school
and the charity we are collecting for.”
However, he also stressed that ICSM-
SU “never asked or even encouraged
anyone to go to the UCL Union and it
was not one of the assigned pubs on
our circle line route”, adding that while
“RAG has organized the collect, [it]
cannot be accountable for the actions
of two irresponsible students acting
out of their own accord”. Furthermore
“ RAG t shirts ... were bought by med-
ics and non medics, so [it] cannot be
certain that [those involved] are part
of the medical school”.
While neither ICSMSU nor the cen-
tral Union have received any formal
complaint from UCLU the ICSMSU
plans to fully investigate the inci-
dent when its President, Shiv Vohra,
returns from annual leave later this
month.
bringing home their respective tro-
phies. Finally, netball will be ﬁghting
to come back from their undeserved
loss last year, and re-establish their
winning streak over CSM.
The Royal School of Mines and
Camborne School of Mines alter-
nate in hosting the varsity weekend,
and after a very successful trip down
to Cornwall last year for RSM, Cam-
borne will be taking the trip up to
London this year. The Bottle Match
is the deﬁnition of a great rivalry, and
with a great rivalry comes even great-
er support. Last year the RSM had
around 200 keen supporters making
the cross-country journey, and it will
not be a surprise to have just as many
Camborne miners at Harlington next
Saturday. For the ﬁrst time there will
be a food van and a bar open through-
out the Saturday at Harlington, fol-
lowed by the traditional player’s din-
ner back at Imperial. The weekend is
capped oﬀ with an awards ceremony
and after-party in Metric.
Anyone is welcome to come along
and support The Bottle Match, the
Saturday (23rd) begins at Harlington
at 9am, and the rugby will end the
day kicking oﬀ at 2pm. Join us in the
Union from around 8pm for the after-
party. Let’s bring the Bottle back to the
Union Bar for the third year in a row!
