FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY
Coffee Break hits the campaign trail to determine
the movers and shakers that won’t be appearing
Election super special
lection fever is gripping
Imperial!
Wait, sorry. Did I just
write that? Let me start
again.
Lukewarm anticipation towards
elections is gripping Imperial!
Maybe I’m being a little harsh. Elec-
tion season is no-holds barred event
stuﬀ, granted. But then Tom Daley’s
primetime ITV ‘smash-hit’ Splash! is
event stuﬀ in my mind too.
Nevertheless, it’s that time of year
when a few people go ahead and nom-
inate themselves for a bevy of illustri-
ous sounding positions in an attempt
to scale the heady heights of the Union
Political SceneTM
. When you play the
game of #voteicu you win or you get
beaten by RON. There is no middle
ground.
Personally I can’t wait for the results
of CGCU Bolt and Spanner Bearer –
at least you know what you’re getting
for your money.
Anyway, any election needs a good
campaign team, so we here at Coﬀee
Break have put our heads together and
derived the ultimate team that you’ll
want by your side in your quest to be
head honcho on the Imperial cam-
paign trail.
Donald Trump:
Communications Officer
Recommended for his measured use of
social network Twitter
An example of this can be found from
antics last week, when ‘The Don-
ald’ took a no-nonsense approach to
American rapper Mac Miller’s un-
authorised use of Trump’s name in
his hit single, entitled, well, ‘Donald
Trump’.
“Little @MacMiller, I’m now going
to teach you a big boy lesson about
lawsuits and finance. You ungrateful
dog!”
I presume Trump followed this
zinger up by proclaiming Mr Miller an
irascible hound, or perhaps a mangy
cur.
President Barack Obama:
Team Leader
Recommended for being the President of
the United States
The guy’s already won the biggest
election in the universe. What else
would you want? You could even
buddy up and make one of those ri-
otous political advertisements where
you make your opponent out to be a
bit of a shady character, and impli-
cate them in business scandals and
all that kind of stuﬀ. That might not
be within the Union’s rules though. It
probably isn’t.
Daniel-Day Lewis:
You
Recommended for being an Oscar-win-
ning actor
When I say method, you say actor. The
gentleman chooses his roles wisely
and has loads of awards for portray-
ing people who aren’t him. So why not
just hire him to be you for a couple of
weeks? That way, if you have project
deadlines stacking up, you could stay
in the Library while he goes around
lecture theatres doing shout-outs and
throwing out sweets. I’m sure he can
play socially awkward very well.
Will Daniel Day-Lewis
run for Union President?
If you want to experience the
Felix Office ﬁrst hand, drop us an email.
We always need writers, illustrators,
photographers and probably more.

STUDENT FAILS TO
ENJOY WORK
DROPPED
BAGUETTE –
NOBODY CARES
A frustrated student wrote in to
Trash Talk to vent his anger when
it emerged that his computer
code wasn’t working. Comput-
ing student Raj Denton was un-
dertaking a project when he “ran
into a brick wall, metaphorically”.
Denton has since been struggling
to rectify his mistakes. Speak-
ing to Trash Talk, he spoke of the
“disappointment” he currently felt.
“You know that feeling when
you look on the back of the pack-
aging for a Chicken Caesar
Wrap expecting it to be properly
healthy, then you see all the red
values for sugar and saturated
fats and stuff? That’s basically
how I felt when my code didn’t
compile, and it’s how I still feel.”
“I took to Facebook and posted a
status about how frustrated I was
with the work,” he continued, “It
got seven likes, which was nice.”
A mystery surrounding an aban-
doned baguette on Sherfield
Walkway was unravelled in thrill-
ing fashion earlier this week.
Potential hypotheses for its place-
ment ranged from consumer distaste
to (as special services probably no
longer refer to it as) a ‘dead drop’.
Student Alex Parr came forward to
explain that the lone baguette sim-
ply came about due to an incident
where she accidentally dropped
her lunch and coffee: “Looking
back I really should have picked
up the baguette, but spilling the
coffee really was one step too far
and it was all just too embarrass-
ing. Going back for it was never
an option either, someone might
have recognised me from earlier.”
When asked for an outsider’s
opinion, a third year mathemat-
ics undergraduate said that he
had “no knowledge” of the event.
