The Life of a Total WBanker
ou’ve ﬁnished your de-
gree. You worked hard
and you got the grades.
The world is your meta-
phorical oyster. With
your hard earned piece of paper you
can do whatever your heart desires.
So why do nearly a third of us end up
working in the ﬁnancial services?
With banks as public enemy num-
ber one, the City is facing a crisis.
New regulation promises to limit
risky casino banking and with it
the large proﬁts and bonuses they
brought are likely to disappear. So is
ﬁnance a dream job to aspire to or do
Imperial students just lack imagina-
tion? Let’s meet one of them.
“Hello Lance. I hear you want to be
a banker.” “Yes, it’s the best job and
I want to be the best,” replies Lance.
“Why do you think it’s the best?”
“Well it pays the most.” “But you’ll
be very time-poor.” “That’s okay. I’ll
only do it for ﬁve years, become rich,
then leave.”
This is a conversation we’ve all heard
a hundred times before. It sounds rea-
sonable, but does Lance’s viewpoint
actually stand up to scrutiny? Let’s
look at a real-life example. A 2008
Maths graduate got a job working in
Mergers & Acquisitions for Goldman
Sachs – this is basically Lance’s dream
job. His starting salary was £35,000
and he would usually clock around 85
hours a week. This works out to £7.90
per hour, which is actually below the
London Living Wage. So Lance would
be ﬁnancially better oﬀ if he were to
spend those hours cleaning the of-
ﬁce rather than playing with spread-
sheets. It’s true that Lance’s salary
progression is better than your aver-
age cleaner’s, so one day he’ll outdo
Dorris. But it’s ludicrous to think you
can make a life-changing amount of
money in your ﬁrst ﬁve years.
“That’s okay,” pipes up Lance, “I’ll
do it for ten years then.” “Well Lance,
ﬁrstly, I’m glad that your life plan is
so well thought-out that a ten second
calculation can throw it oﬀ course.
But if you want to make serious mon-
ey you’re going to need to climb the
corporate ladder.” “So how do I do
that? Be the best at my job?” “Silly
Lance, these jobs could be done by a
four year old. You’ll never stand out
that way. If you want to progress you
need to brand yourself a winner, and
that’s an expensive business. There’s
no living like a student anymore. To
act the part you need the expensive
suit, Omega watch and to be blowing
your money on nights out in Mayfair.
If the team jets oﬀ to Monaco for the
weekend, then that’s what you do too
whether or not you can actually af-
ford it. Managing relationships (read:
Y
The City life ain’t all it’s cracked up to be, warns Adam Billing
sucking up) is key in this industry and
you need to do your part, otherwise
that next promotion won’t be coming
your way. Unfortunately, with all this
spending it’s going to be diﬃcult for
you to amass that fortune you were
talking about.”
Why is Lance so keen for cash? I’m
not entirely sure he knows. But let’s
get one thing straight: money is not a
reason in itself. No one actually wants
a pile of cash. What Lance is after are
the things that money can bring: ﬁ-
nancial freedom, lifestyle, a big house
(status) and a fast car (penis exten-
sion). So is a City career the best way
to achieve these things?
I have a confession to make: I was
once a Lance. I went oﬀ to the City
to seek my fortune, but instead this is
what I found.
Financial freedom: because of the
pressures to “live the lifestyle” my
colleagues were the most indebted in-
dividuals I have ever met. There were
people on £300,000 salaries that were
“leveraged” ten times their earnings –
i.e. they owed the bank three million
quid! Losing your job with that much
debt means immediate and deﬁnite
ﬁnancial ruin. In fact, most were
screwed if they didn’t get the right
bonus. This is as far from ﬁnancial
freedom as I can imagine.
Far from being an isolated incident,
massive leveraging is rife. It’s fuelled
by the belief that you’re top dog; you’ll
be richer next year so why worry
about today. This short sighted think-
ing can leave you trapped in a job
you have tired of and leads to bodies
littering the pavements of St. Paul’s
when ﬁnancial crises break.
Many enter the City with the belief
that they’ll do it diﬀerently. Unfor-
tunately, The Square Mile is a tribal
place. If you’re not with them, you’re
against them. If you don’t take part
in the lifestyle, part of which is living
above your means, then you’re implic-
itly critical of those who do – which
is everyone. People will mistrust you
and you won’t form the relationships
you need to be successful.
Lifestyle: You’re never going to be-
come Roman Abramovich by being a
banker. It’s a well-paid job but it’s still
just a job and selling your labour is
not a scalable business model. How-
ever, there’s no denying that bankers
are generally wealthy. So what do they
do with all that money? What expe-
riences do they have, that we mere
mortals can only dream of? Well as
far as I could tell, their experiences
weren’t that dissimilar to my own:
they lived in a house, drove a car, oc-
casionally went to restaurants and
would go on holiday once or twice a
year. The diﬀerence was they would
spend a lot more money doing these
things.
If they went on holiday it had to
be somewhere with ‘service.’ I mean
what’s the point in money if you can’t
make plebs do things for you? The car
has to be new and replaced frequent-
ly. My boss even paid £800 to have
his Range Rover resprayed because
a cat walked across the bonnet. The
main goal of these excessive expen-
ditures seems to be so you can talk
about them loudly in the oﬃce. So I
don’t think it was appreciated when I
suggested that a £5.99 bottle of T-Cut
would have done the same job.
Status: It might impress your mum
but is it really a high status job? Sta-
tus is in the eye of the beholder. So if
your aim in life is to impress Mayfair
airheads then congratulations, you’ve
found your calling. But they don’t un-
derstand what it is you actually do.
The truth is, depending on your job
title, you’re somewhere between an
Excel monkey and a PowerPoint mon-
key; you’re doing a job that doesn’t
challenge you and whose only social
worth is to make rich people richer.
So whom are you looking to impress?
And is it worth it?
Everyone has diﬀerent aspirations
in life and it’s not for me to tell you
how to live yours. However, the Im-
perial view of the City is far from the
reality I encountered. Hopefully a few
more people sharing their experienc-
es might counter the multi-million
pound propaganda machine that we
are fed in College.
But for those still determined to fol-
low in Lance’s footsteps, a ﬁnal word.
We don’t live in the 80s anymore. The
mantra of “greed is good” has failed
and there is a deep mistrust of the
complex ﬁnancial instruments that
Imperial students were employed to
deal with. In the coming years the
City will face heavy regulation, and
with it the inﬂated proﬁts and bonus-
es they produced will vanish. Sure it
won’t happen overnight, but why get
on a sinking ship?
There are more career options than
ﬁnance, a PhD or teaching: change
the world with an NGO; join the cy-
ber war by breaking codes at GCHQ;
or be the next David Attenborough.
Science and technology are the fu-
ture of our economy so why not join
a start-up, or better yet, create your
own. Your 20s are when you are most
free to take risks, don’t waste them on
a grad scheme making tea for Lance.
This short-
sighted
thinking can
leave you
trapped in a
job you have
tired of.
No matter how hard you try, you
will never be as cool as this man
