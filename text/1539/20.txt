ome January we’ve had this
year, huh? College and tests
right after Christmas, Brit-
ain’s coldest winter in 100
months (complete with that
massive bout of dandruﬀ from heav-
en), and the weather boﬃns are saying
February won’t be much better. Not to
worry, though: at times like these, you
can always count on a lovely, steaming
mug of hot chocolate to make you nice
and toasty (well, other than a warm
cuddle from that special someone).
Nope, not cocoa, not that mug of Nes-
quick, Swiss Miss, Milo or whatever
you call it. There’s a time and place
for that stuﬀ, but today, we’re going to
discuss real hot chocolate – the stuﬀ
that’s thick, rich and unctuous, the
drink that warms you to your toes.
With that in mind, I decided to seek
out the best hot chocolates around
Imperial. Make no mistake – this is
no easy task. I had to sieve through a
considerable number of insipid, weak
cups masquerading as hot chocolate
(some with ridiculous prices to boot,
no less). Sure, one can make do with a
sachet of Cadbury’s stirred into boil-
ing water or a cuppa from JCR, just
as one can survive with nothing but
Sainsbury’s basics, but it’s not going to
impress that cutie from across the hall
– and you gotta live a little, eh? Still,
there’s a lot of hot chocolate out there,
and only so much a student can aﬀord.
Being the selﬂess and altruistic person
that I am, I shall aid you lot by shar-
ing the results of my labours. So here’s
what you can ﬁnd around school...
Chains – Paul, Caffé Nero,
Starbucks
Lowest on the rung are the epony-
mous coﬀee and bread chains, Star-
bucks, Paul and Caﬀé Nero. Right oﬀ
the bat, forget about Starbucks – there
are far better ways to waste ~ £3 than
a cup of overly sweet brown-tinged
water which barely resembles choco-
late. Caﬀé Nero and Paul are far bet-
ter – while Caﬀé Nero does have a
‘normal’ version, both serve a thick,
European cup of hot chocolate. How-
ever, I found Paul’s to be rich, intense
and very chocolate-y, whereas Caﬀé
Nero’s just seemed very sweet and had
a strong taste of cornstarch. It’s quite a
bit to pay for a drink, but for what you
get, it’s worth it.
Special Chains – Gail’s Arti-
san Bakery, Oddono’s, Pain
au Quotiden, Ottolenghis
Next on the list come these places
which are still chains, but are far posh-
er by nature. Surprisingly, though, the
hot chocolate here isn’t much to shout
about. For all their exquisite looking
breads and decadent pastries, Gail’s
artisan bakery and Pain au Quotiden
serve up rather lackadaisical mugs.
Pain’s seemed very sweet and runny
but lacking in chocolate ﬂavour, while
Gail’s initially encouraging use of
packet Valhrona hot chocolate was ru-
ined by an inept use of the steam wand
and an easy hand with the milk. Odd-
ono’s, one of the places many netizens
recommend for good hot chocolate,
proved to be good - but the best still
goes to Ottolenghi’s, the super-posh
café with a stellar reputation that is
well deserved. The steaming mug de-
livers an intense hit of hot chocolate
which isn’t too sweet or too thick,
and is extremely satisfying. Thing is,
the location may be a bit of a trek for
most.
Chocolatiers – Rococo
Chocolate, Hotel Chocolat,
Melt, Cocomaya
Last comes the cream of the crop –
places which exude luxury and class
and make you feel intimidated from
simply staring through their windows.
Feel free to stride in with gumption,
though – prices for something like hot
chocolate at these chocolatiers don’t
really diﬀer that much from other
places. Still, there’s a great deal of vari-
Valentine’s heaven cupcakes!
Hot Chockablocked with warm drinks
ation between cups. Rococo serves a
thick shot of chocolate that’s more
fondue-like in taste and consistency,
and Melt’s dark hot chocolate comes
from a proprietary blend of in-store
chocolate with a distinctive taste that
can only be described as ‘interest-
ing’. For the thrill-seekers, maybe; but
the rest of us who want our money’s
worth would be better oﬀ going to
Hotel Chocolat. Despite its upmarket
appearance, a mug to go costs a mere
£2.50 (paltry, really, in comparison)
and comes in three ﬂavours, all of
which are intense, strong and delight-
ful. Cocomaya’s on the other hand was
perfectly adequate, but just a little too
thin and too expensive for its size.
Conclusion? Paul for that quick op-
tion, or if one is truly craving for some
decent chocolate, head to High Street
Kensington’s Hotel Chocolat for a
mug. Even better, their Liquid Choco-
lat is available in stores so that any des-
perate student can whip up their own
mug in the comforts of their hall kitch-
en – and you can add as many marsh-
mallows (or other extras) as you want!
These divine cupcakes are perfect for
the occasion, whether you are cel-
ebrating or not!
And guess what? You can make them
yourself. They are extremely easy and
taste just as good as they look. You will
deﬁnitely impress...
Ingredients:
(Makes 12)
Recipe taken and slightly modified from the
book Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World.
For the cupcakes:
1 cup almond milk
1 teaspoon vinegar
3/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup oil
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup ﬂour
1/3 cup cocoa
3/4 teaspoon soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup strawberry marmalade
For the chocolate mousse:
350 grams dark chocolate
1 packet silken tofu
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1/4 cup almond milk
For decorating:
5 strawberries
1/4 cup blueberries
Procedure:
Preheat your oven to 180 degrees.
Place cupcake cases in a cupcake tin.
In a bowl, mix all the dry ingredi-
ents. In a separate bowl mix the milk
with the vinegar and set aside for ten
minutes so that it curdles. Then, add
the rest of the liquid ingredients to the
milk and vinegar mixture and mix. Af-
ter that, add the liquid mixture to the
dry ingredients and mix until the ﬂour
is dissolved. Be careful no to over mix
otherwise the cupcakes will not be
ﬂuﬀy.
Pour the mixture in the cupcake cas-
es so that they are 2/3 full. Bake for 18
to 20 minutes or until you can insert a
toothpick in the middle and it comes
out dry.
Leave the cupcakes to cool for 1
hour. Once they are cool spread mar-
malade on top, creating a circle leav-
ing 1cm from the edges. Place the
cupcakes in the fridge.
To make the mousse, place the tofu,
milk and maple syrup in a blender.
Blend until it is completely smooth.
You might need to use a spatula to stir
and make sure that it is completely
smooth.
Make a double boiler by putting
water in a large pot and then placing
a small pot on top so that the water
covers 1/2 the height of the small pot.
Bring to boil, turn the heat oﬀ and put
the chocolate cut in small pieces in the
small pot. Stir until it has completely
melted. Leave the melted chocolate to
cool for 5 minutes and then add it to
the blender. Again, blend until every-
thing is completely combined. Put the
mousse in the fridge for 1 hour.
Using a piping bag decorate the
cupcakes with the mousse and place
a slice of fresh strawberry and some
blueberries on top. Enjoy!
