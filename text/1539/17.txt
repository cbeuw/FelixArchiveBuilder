RepWeek 2013
Rep Week 2013 is running from
11 – 15 February and provides a
platform to celebrate the great
changes that have taken place
with the help of your academic
representative system.
Your Academic Reps will be
wearing bright red t-shirts all this
week so keep an eye out for
them. Feel free to give them any
tips on how your time at Imperial
can improved. You can do this by
emailing, Facebook messaging or
talking to them in person.
The 448 tips collected from Rep
Week 2012 were typed up and
sent to your academic reps, who
were encouraged to bring them
up at their next Staff-Student
Committee. If you want to talk to
your reps then come to the Junior
Common Room between 12:00
-14:00 on Monday and Friday.
StudentAcademic ChoiceAwards
There are eight awards in total that
will cover all faculties, departments
and campuses. There will also be
speciﬁc prizes available for those
who supervise doctoral students,
teach master’s students, and work
in professional roles within College.
The awards aren’t designed to be a
popularity contest but a recognition
of innovation, skill, engagement
and energy that students have
received from academics.
We are looking for nominations
from every department, centre,
study type and campus, and
that’s where you come in!
Nominations are open now on the
Imperial College Union website
at imperialcollegeunion.org/
academicchoice. More information
will also be added soon.
Alternatively, we will be in the
Sherﬁeld foyer on Tuesday and
Thursday. We will be rewarding the
three best suggestions with £20
Union vouchers and you can even
tweet your suggestions by giving
your course and using #loveyourrep
on Twitter.
If you don’t know who your rep is
then please use Imperial College
Union’s “Your Representatives A to
Z” directory on our website.

This year, we are running our
ﬁrst ever awards for academics,
nominated and chosen entirely by
students. The awards are designed
to celebrate and reward good
teaching and emphasise teaching
as a skill of equal worth and value
as research. We also want to build
a community in which students,
academics and staff all feel
ownership of the development and
delivery of their course.
