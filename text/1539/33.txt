FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY-
34
Felix Film favouri
Jennifer Lawrence
Silver Linings Playbook
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? Yes
Winter’s Bone (2011)
Why she will win:
Lawrence is also becoming a
household name in Hollywood
as a young, fresh-faced,
incredibly gifted actress
who can handle various
roles ranging from small
independent ﬁlms to huge,
blockbuster movies. Her
most recent performance
as an unstable woman gave
the critics plenty to cheer
about: singling out her mature
performance as one of the
ﬁlm’s big highlights. Plus, she
won the SAG Award for Best
Actress, always a good sign
when predicting the Oscars.
Why she won’t win:
Is she too young? Do 22 -year-
olds win Best Actress Oscars?
Emmanuelle Riva
Amour
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? No
Why she will win:
The oldest actress to have
ever been nominated in this
category (85!!!), distinguished
French actress Riva got a
surprising but certainly
deserving nomination
starring in Michael Haneke’s
foreign indie favourite, with
a beautifully heart-wrenching
performance of a stroke victim
that eventually leaves her bed-
bound and incapacitated.
Why she won’t win:
It’s very difficult to win in a
foreign language performance,
and only a handful of actors
have won in the past. In such
a tough category, and without
many wins so far, this one will
have to be all about the honour
of being nominated.
Quvenzhané Wallis
Beasts of the Southern Wild
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? No
Why she will win:
The youngest actress ever to
be nominated for the Best
Actress Oscar (9!!!), she was
even younger (6!!!) during the
ﬁlming of Benh Zeitlin’s indie
hit. Hand-picked from over
4,000 girls, her performance is
a fearless yet adorable one.
Why she won’t win:
Now she is deﬁnitely too
young to win this thing. Young
performers have succeeded
in the past to score some
“Supporting” awards but
whenitcomestothe“Leading”
category, more seasoned,
more experienced people tend
to scoop the prize. This doesn’t
diminish her startling efforts
however, it’s just that there’s
no way she’ll win this year.
Naomi Watts
The Impossible
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? Yes
21 Grams (2003)
Why she will win:
Oscar winning actress Reese
Witherspoonwassoincredibly
moved by Watts’ performance
that she wrote an open letter
praising the actress’ utterly
fearless performance in Juan
Antonio Bayona’s tsunami
disaster family drama. And
Ms. Witherspoon is absolutely
right: a performance of
immense strength as well as
vulnerability, it’s a powerful
display in one hell of an
emotionally draining ﬁlm.
Why she won’t win:
It’s just Watts representing
the ﬁlm now, with the movie
having been ignored on all
fronts in other categories = not
a very good sign.
Jessica Chastain
Zero Dark Thirty
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? Yes
The Help (2011)
Why she will win:
Chastain is on a roll, rapidly
rising as one of the most
sought-after actresses after
only a couple of years of
exposure. Back in 2010, no-
one had heard of this talented
individual. 2011, all critics
could talk about was her
extraordinary versatility. And
this year she has done it again,
heading Kathryn Bigelow’s
war drama to hunt Osama bin
Laden.
Why she won’t win:
She missed out on the vital
Screen Actors Guild Award
to fellow nominee Jennifer
Lawrence. Now this is by no
means a straightaway loss but
it does decrease her chances.
