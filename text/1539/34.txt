FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY
ites for the Oscars
Bradley Cooper
Silver Linings Playbook
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? No
Why he will win:
With the tough concept of
mental illness, Cooper does
a stunning job in bringing
out both the comedic and
dramatic sides of his complex
character.Hisperformancehas
been described as “carefully
developed” and “perfectly
pitched”. Not bad at all for a
first-time nominee.
Why he won’t win:
The film itself has been
criticised for being a bog-
standard romantic comedy
withacop-outending.Plushe’s
up against one of the greatest
actors of this generation in
one of his greatest roles yet.
Anyone competing with
Daniel Day-Lewis is in for
some tough times ahead.
Daniel Day-Lewis
Lincoln
Previous winner? Yes
My Left Foot (1989)
There Will Be Blood (2007)
Previous nominee? Yes
In the Name of the Father
(1993)
Gangs of New York (2002)
Why he will win:
This is as Oscar-friendly and
Oscar-baity as it gets. Playing
a celebrated, iconic, forever-
loved American President,
in a film focusing on one of
the most important years
of American history, Steven
Spielberg’s latest biopic has
been lavished with awards,
a lot of them rightly going to
Day-Lewis’ stunning portrayal
of the man himself. A win with
the SAG doesn’t hurt either.
Why he won’t win:
A third Oscar is always a tricky
one to get.
Hugh Jackman
Les Misérables
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? No
Why he will win:
There is a lot of backlash on the
actors’ singing abilities in Tom
Hooper’s stirring musical epic.
And yes, the actors aren’t all
perfect live-singers, but within
the context of the film and
what’s going on in the screen,
their vocals match the intense
performances everyone is
giving. Jackman gets better
as the film progresses, and his
final departing scene is one of
true wonder.
Why he won’t win:
Whatever anyone says about
Jackman’s astounding turn
here, there will always be
detractors when it comes to
musicals and especially with
this live-singing that brought
out some wobbly notes.
Joaquin Phoenix
The Master
Previous winner? No
Previous nominee? Yes
Gladiator (2000)
Walk the Line (2005)
Why he will win:
Paul Thomas Anderson’s films
have almost always secured
acting nominations even if
his films would sometimes go
unnoticed. Here is Phoenix
at his most volatile and
unpredictable, one of the best
in his career, right after his...
ahem...”rap/singing/comical
farce career” sidetrack.
Why he won’t win:
The Master had fantastic buzz
– back in September. But now,
not so much, next to nothing.
And remember when he
dissed the Academy calling it
“bullshit”? It’s lucky he got this
nomination – he could have
been tossed aside entirely.
Denzel Washington
Flight
Previous winner? Yes
Glory (1989)
Training Day (2001)
Previous nominee? Yes
Cry Freedom (1987)
Malcolm X (1992)
The Hurricane (1999)
Why he will win:
As an airline pilot struggling
with dangerous addiction to
alcohol and drugs, two-time
winner Washington is in a
deep character study for this
one as he is forced to confront
hisdemonswhenahorrendous
accident leaves his future in
jeopardy.
Why he won’t win:
There is just far too much
competition here for a repeat
winner to shine in a film that
hasn’t been receiving that
much buzz as of late. He’ll have
to sit this one out.
