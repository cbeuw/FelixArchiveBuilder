Imperial students were banned from
the University College London Un-
ion (UCLU) following accusations of
criminal damage and theft by Med-
ics RAG during their Circle Line Pub
Crawl.
The ban came to light on Saturday
2 February when a group of Imperial
students were turned away from the
UCLU, located on Gordon Street,
close to Euston train station. The stu-
dents were told that the ban was the
result of the actions of another group
of some 30 students who had come in
the previous night.
In a comment given to Felix Sam
Gaus, Democracy and Communica-
tions Oﬃcer at UCLU, said: “Some
students in Imperial RAG t-shirts
were found having stolen something
from the UCLU on Friday night. Our
Commercial Services Manager is the
license holder and so has the ability to
ban people from entering the prem-
ises at his discretion. He decided that
until he could talk to the Full-Time Of-
ﬁcers on Monday, he would ban Impe-
rial students from entering the prem-
ises over the weekend as a result of the
theft.” He added that while “Imperial
students are now allowed back in the
bar, ... the two students who stole the
items are still banned from the bars”.
The nature of the items has not
been disclosed but it is known that
they were stolen from UCL medical
students. The Imperial students were
wearing Raising and Giving (RAG)
t-shirts and have been conﬁrmed to
be from ICSMSU RAG and not ICU
RAG, which are separate. They ap-

was not one of the oﬃcial destina-
tions.
Shoaib Rivizi, the ICSMSU RAG
Chair, expressed disappointment at
the behaviour of the Imperial stu-
dents, saying: “I think it is important

redesign needs
your input
Over the last few weeks most stu-
dents at university have settled back
into a routine of lectures, coursework
and exams as they return to univer-
sity ready to face the challenges ahead.
However, the story is very diﬀerent for
the Syrian students at UK universi-
ties; the civil war in Syria means they
are unable to pay their fees or meet
living costs, they face the prospects
of deportation and death. Topped
with this, they are dealing with the
continuous anguish facing their fam-
ily and friends at home, in a war-torn
country. A country that has had over
60,000 deaths since March 2011. It
is currently uncertain what Imperial
College will do if Syrian students are
aﬀected, although none have come
forward to say they are at the present
time.

The College has embarked on the
Website Redesign Project 2013 and
has requested volunteers to aid them
in renewing the Imperial website for
the ﬁrst time since 2007. Events and
consultations will take place over the
next weeks in an attempt to gain in-
sight into the views of student users.
According to the Rector’s staﬀ brief-
ing on the subject, the project will be
led by Imperial’s Communications
and Development and ICT depart-
ment. Domain7, a web design agency,
have also been hired to support the
project.
The refurbishment is meant to up-
date the website in order to meet the
changing needs of the website. The
College is keen to say that the cur-
rent website is still “considered a sec-
tor example of best practice”, but they
aim at changing the suiting the site at
what they see as a potentially diﬀerent
audience structure and to refresh the
design with included mobile compat-
ibility.
It will be the Domain7 agency that
on 11 February will be organising
multiple focus groups and interviews
with diﬀerent areas in the key audi-
ence, with users and other stakehold-
ers. They are, therefore, still looking
for some volunteers from prospec-
tive students, current students and
alumni. Participation in this may in-
volve testing and feedback to optimise
navigation and user-friendliness. To
ﬁnd out more about taking part you
can contact e.chesterman@imperial.
ac.uk.
This will be complemented with a
web forum on the 13th February cov-
ering development and design aspira-
tions. This event can be attended by
registering with Liz Smith: e.swift@
imperial.ac.uk.
