PISCES
This week your ears are
swapped with your balls. This
redistribution of your erogenous
zones is at first disconcerting,
especially when you have to
put your earphones down your
pants to listen to your iPod, but
you soon learn to appreciate it.
But, it’s now a lot harder to listen
to your brain over your penis.
This week you are craving
cheezburgerz SO BAD you
can’t think about anything else.
But it’s 3am on Monday morn-
ing and everywhere is closed.
You kill, mince and fry a pigeon
in desperation, smother it in
knob cheese and wrap it in the
crumbs it was pecking. It’s not
on a par with GBK but it’ll do.
This week your saliva becomes
too acidic. When you manage
to pull a girl in Metric, your min-
gling mouth fluids erode her
lips but you’re both too drunk
to notice until her whole face
has been dissolved. The only
screams you’ll be coaxing out
of her tonight are of terror at
lacking a face, not pleasure.
This week your flat becomes the
battleground for a rat civil war
so you become a refugee in the
Library. 11pm on Friday night,
you are cruelly cast from your
asylum into the barren wilder-
ness of Queen’s Lawn. You try to
shelter in the protective shadow
of Queen’s Tower but the stone
lions gobble you up. Pint?
This week you are super excited
about Valentine’s Day and de-
cidetoprepareaspecialdessert
to mark the occasion: cupcakes
with whipping cream, melted
chocolate and strawberries. You
set one place for yourself, one
foryourlecturenotesandonefor
your lab report in preparation for
a wild, passionate threesome.
This week your bucket of tears
at your loneliness causes Silvio
Berlusconi to pop up as your
love guru. He teaches you the
ways of seducation, and, within
no time, you find yourself acci-
dentally being voted in as Prime
Minister of Italy. There’s loads
of work to do, but at least you
know how to turn people on...
This week the Mega Bus man
haunts your dreams and bru-
tally stabs you. You’re so dis-
orientated when you wake up
that you swear this horoscope
is in bold and is blue. But it’s
not. Is it? You’re still asleep
and the Mega Bus man is
finding new ways to torture
you: with low value long haul
coach trips. Scary.
This week you speed and
get your wife to accept the
fine. Woop woop. No points,
no ban, oh yeah. What could
possibly go wrong with this
plan. You email your old mate
Chris Huhne to tell him of the
scheme. You get an out of of-
fice reply that says “Don’t ever
leave your wife if she is part of
your evil plans”.
This week your hair is ripped
out by a Lizard King that has
taken over your halls and en-
slaved the freshers. You are
now expected to suck it’s cock
at all opportunities. You didn’t
even know Lizard King’s had
cocks. You tweet David At-
tenborough with your question
but he doesn’t reply. Sigh. Oh
well. Pint?
This week you morph into 50
Cent and start participating
in dry bys. As you’re at Impe-
rial, the only drive by oppor-
tunities are revision ones. You
merk someone with a mental
maths problem. That’ll teach
them for not helping you out
on that last problem sheet
you had. They resent you for
ever.
This week you get laid. Nah,
joking. You’re still a virgin.
VIRGIN
Just thought it would be
easier for you to understand
if printed bigger. Some time
though. Maybe. Pint?
This week you have to choose
between spending Valentine’s
Day sober and alone at a cou-
ples’ massage class or sober
and alone in a romantic restau-
rant. Either way, you’re going to
be sober and alone, miserably
drowning in a sea of PDAs while
simultaneously electrocuted by
sparks of others’ sexual antici-
pation. What’s it going to be?
