each island must

bridges stemming
from it as the number

Fill the cells with a
continuousline(the
‚Äúsnake‚Äù) that does
not pass through a
cell twice, doesn‚Äôt
intersect with itself,
and passes through
all white boxes. The
numbers show you
how many times
the snake turns in
the corresponding
row or column. The
snake enters and
exits the grid at the
shown points (and
only those points).
There‚Äôs a hint to get
you started.

Last week‚Äôs crossword
The numbers in each row and col-
umn show you how many groups
of black squares are in a row or
column, as well as how many
black squares each group consists
of. Filling in the grid produces a
pretty picture, which in turn pro-
duces points if you send it in.
