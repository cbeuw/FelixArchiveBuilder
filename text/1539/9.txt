FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY
mperial Hub will be bringing
to you Imperial College’s in-
augural International Devel-
opment Conference (IC IDC)
on 23rd February 2013. The
conference will bring together lead-
ing thinkers in academia, government
and global development to consider
“The Role of Science and Technology
in International Development”.
With Imperial College having some
of the brightest young minds in sci-
ence and engineering, the theme for
this IDC at Imperial is the ideal way
to introduce the topic of international
development.
But why is development so impor-
tant? In 2008, 1.29 billion people were
living below the poverty line (on less
than $1.25 per day). You might say
it’s not possible for us to make a dif-
ference and lift these people out of
poverty, but estimates have suggested
that the extreme poverty rate be-
tween 1990 and 2008 was halved! So
it’s not just negative statistics that are
hanging about, but instead the posi-
tive ones like these are inspirational.
Imagine what a diﬀerence the use of
science, technology and engineering
in developing countries could make;
healthcare accessibility could be
rapidly improved through the use of
mobile technologies, access to educa-
tion and learning could also be made
equally accessible. Engineering appli-
cations can bring clean water to rural
communities, something which we
take for granted on a day to day basis.
We only have two years left to reach
the UN’s 2015 Millennium Develop-
ment Goals and progress towards
reaching these targets varies country
by country. This is where we as young
scientists and engineers play an in-
creasingly important role. Over the
next decade, we will be the leading
ﬁgures in the world and we will be the
ones who have the chance to make a
change and reach the next set of tar-
gets, what better place to start than at
the IC IDC?
The IDC will bring together speak-
ers from a range of backgrounds to-
gether to discuss international devel-
opment in an inspiring environment.
Speakers include Dr Kirsty Newman,
from the UK’s Department for Inter-
national Development and Imperial’s
own Professor Alan Fenwick OBE
talking on infectious diseases.
Early bird tickets are now on sale
at www.imperialidc.org at £6 for stu-
dents, which includes a day of semi-
nars from leading speakers and your
lunch!
IC-IDC will be your opportunity
to hear from leading speakers in the
realm of international development
to see how you can be the one to
make a change and a positive global
impact.
