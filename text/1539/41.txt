That day again: remember
that nobody loves you day
Got a photo of someone being a
waste of a student loan?

For lolz, cc in the Daily Mail
Nah, just kidding. That subtitle is
a lie. You should be scared shitless
right now. If everyone thinks you’re
a repulsive loser now, when you’re
in your prime, imagine what they’ll
think about you in a year’s time: ex-
actly the same... Anyway, don’t worry
about feeling bitter and having a way
too long term relationship with your
hand, it’s not like Hangman is a fan of
this holiday designed so people can
be irritating and rub it in our faces
how much they love each other. They
usually come in a variety of annoying
twattiness, but here are some of the
classics:
The gesture topper:
This person is insuﬀerable even if you
are in a real, loving relationship too.
You: “Yeah, we just stayed in and got
cards and I cooked dinner and it was
really nice.”
Them: “Huh? Yeah, that sounds al-
right. I didn’t do too much.”
You: “What did you do?”
Them: (Cue smug look) “Well, I se-
cretly booked a table three months
ago at Heston Blumenthal’s restaurant
and I got Beyoncé to personally sing,
well, mime, a love song. Then 1000
doves were let loose while the ﬁfteen
boxes of chocolate I bought were pre-
sented by tamed lions. Yours sounds
nice though. Do you think mine was
good enough?”
The public love displayer
It will come in the form of someone
saying “BEST VALENTINE’S GIFT
EVER!! WEEKEND IN PARIS!! LOVE
YOU BABES xxxx”. The more likes,
the more public they get. If anyone
comments something like “Ohhh
sounds nice” you should immediately
write “I’ve heard the sewers are ﬂood-
ing at the minute”.
The we don’t celebrate Val-
entine’s Day couple
Yeah sure you don’t. You just do nau-
seating gestures normally right? You
always buy each other cards saying
Happy Valentine’s Day? Usually these
people are also the same people who
say they “don’t want to do anything”
and then squeal with delight at tacky
crap.
Single people that complain
about being alone on this
day
Fuck oﬀ. You get no sympathy. Seems
harsh? There’s logic. You’re alone on
every other day too: what makes this
one special? If you complained about
being alone on every day, and it so
happened your complaint coincided
with Valentine’s Day, you get a token
“awwwww”. Then you may get a hol-
low oﬀer of a cup of tea. Note that
this is actually an “I’m making tea and
think it’s rude not to oﬀer, but I can’t
be bothered to make you one too so
please don’t say yes”.
There you go. That’s all you’re getting
for a “topical” feature. Enjoy Valen-
tine’s Day. And don’t be a tool. That’s
the end of the article. Yep, it really is.
Go away now.
Rap lyrics of
the week
“You might even get paid if you
cook good,
Tell a model it ain’t enough to look
good”
Wow, you’re lucky “good” rhymes
with “good”, or you would be
in some serious trouble. Also, it
seems as if you’re going about this
the wrong way. You’re hiring mod-
els (presumably) and then hop-
ing they are also good at cooking.
Wouldn’t it be better to hire a chef
that you deem to be attractive?
That would be a much easier way
of ensuring both criteria are met.
You could audition for them, then
you even get a free meal! You’d
be like Abercrombie & Fitch, but
without the shit, generic clothes.
Chip: “Rack City”
The infamous Valentine’s Day is here, but don’t worry...

Imperial men pretend to know absolutely
everything about American Football
A record number of Imperial males
have been found to have researched
American Football in the lead up to
the recent Super Bowl, with the hope
of impressing attractive Americans in
the Union and other bars. In a study
by The Turnip, over 60% of single Im-
perial males (99% of the Imperial male
population) who are lonely and get-
ting desperate (98% of the Imperial
male population) had read and memo-
rised the entire Wikipedia entry. Re-
ports suggest that some students even
watched a couple of highlight reels
on YouTube to understand what they
were going to see.
On the night itself, unprecedented
numbers of males were seen acting in
an oddly masculine way and shout-
ing “touchdown” and “quarterback”
nonsensically, whenever they thought
they may have seen an American with
a “thing for a British accent”. Imperial
student, Rob Banking, told The Tur-
nip, “I gave it all I had. I’d even looked
up funny anecdotes about the play-
ers. Something like brothers playing
I think. Unfortunately, it all fell apart
when a joke about the 49ers really be-
ing called the 69ers went astray”. The
last straw seemed to come when Mr
Banking made a reference to guns be-
ing “not great”, only to be slapped in
the face.
The length of the game also con-
fused some revellers. “I thought that
the thing was over like 2 hours before
it actually was”, said James Stiriper.
Many others had their stamina tested,
in a way that their hand doesn’t usu-
ally test, when they realised that for
every one minute of actual stuﬀ hap-
pening about 10 minutes of replays,
adverts, people walking around on
the pitch, and referees making stupid
hand gestures had to be endured.
The usually placid straight males
were also reported to have had to
“try really hard to not look turned on
when the cheerleaders were on the
screen”. With the addition of alcohol,
the students became more conﬁdent
and even started to insinuate that they
“wouldn’t need all that padding”, and
that “rugby was deﬁnitely a tougher
game”. Reports suggest that the men
went home alone and obsessed over
every word they said that night.
84 PLAYERS!? WTF?
