Love for Android Fragmentation
ThebaneandboonofAndroid,theworld’sbiggestmobileecosystem
The big F word in the Android world:
fragmentation.
This is the word that Android scep-
tics and users both decry and hate. It
is both the bane and boon of Android.
When Google made Android open
source, it created a whole new set of
problems and opportunities for users.
Android handset makers have cre-
ated a whole plethora of devices, rang-
ing from the low end to the highest
end like the coveted Samsung Galaxy
S3, for example. These devices across
the whole range of price points have
helped catapult Android to being the
number one smartphone operating
system worldwide. However it has
also caused numerous problems,
both for software developers
and the handset manufactur-
ers. Software developers ﬁnd
it hard to develop for the
huge range of devices and
handset manufacturers
have been notorious
in their slow speed
in the updating of
Android phone’s
software. Save for
Nexus line of
devices bless-
ed by Goog-
le, it is hard
to ﬁnd any
d e v i c e
o u t
there
with
the
latest version of Android within a
few months of its release by Google.
This is because manufacturers tend
to move on to their next product very
quickly after they have released them,
reducing their commercial interests in
continual support for older devices.
But Android is also open source.
And the open source community has
risen up to the challenge of updat-
ing phones that have long since been
abandoned by the manufacturers.
Bring forth Cyanogenmod.
Cyanogenmod is an “aftermarket
ﬁrmware” for phones that is built en-
tirely from the source code of Android
released by Google. Cyanogenmod
supports a whole range of devices. It
is the saviour of users who are unable
to upgrade t h e i r
phones
l o n g
a b a n -
doned by
their manu-
f a c t u r e r s ,
and savour
the latest ver-
sion of the An-
droid OS. It can
literally bring a
fresh breath of new
life to their ailing
phones. It is also an
opportunity for users
who dislike the skins and
customisations that their
phone manufacturers have slapped
onto the phone to use something that
has less bloat.
Inspired by Cyanogenmod, many
other developers have began their
own projects that seek to bring more
radical new features to Android. Pro-
jects such as Paranoid Android bring
about very innovative features like
“pie control” and diﬀerent “modes”
to the phones. Projects such as these
have once again proven that open
source projects can bring about highly
innovative outcomes. The tenacity of
developers in supporting many devic-
es that have long been ditched by the
commercial entities is probably one of
the best outcome that can come out of
Android being open source.
It is hard to
find any de-
vice out there
with the lat-
est version of
Android
The dynam-
ics between
h a r d w a r e
manufacturers
creating too
many devices
and develop-
ers making
aftermarket
ﬁrmware for
phones create
a very unique
c o n s i d e r a -
tion for buy-
ers seeking to
buy Android
devices. One
might ask “will
my phone be
widely sup-
ported by
d e v e l o p e r s
so that I can
have the best
selection of
aftermarket
f i r m w a r e ? ”
G e n e r a l l y ,
phones in the
Nexus series
enjoy the most
amount of de-
veloper’s at-
tention. while
historically,
phones by
HTC have also
been widely
s u p p o r t e d .
S a m s u n g ,
however, is
notorious for
their lack of
documenta-
tion for the
chips used in
their phones.
On the other
end of the
s p e c t r u m ,
Sony has been
tireless in en-
c o u r a g i n g
developers to
develop for
their devices
by release
source code,
for example.
It is an inter-
esting consideration for phone buy-
ers, possibly unique to Android at the
moment. It can only be beneﬁcial to
phone manufacturers if they support
the developer community.
Open source software has always
played a massive role in the software
community. The most popular kernel,
Linux, is open source. When con-
trasted to the extremely closed nature

Instant reply,YAY! No more awkward texts to the wrong people you never wanted to see
of the iPhone, it is extremely easy to
see how being open source has both
harmed and beneﬁtted Android. I
would argue that the beneﬁts that be-
ing open source has brought Android
greatly outweigh the problems of frag-
mentation. Being open is the way for-
ward, and it is with this great foresight
that Google ﬁrst made Android open
source from the get go.
