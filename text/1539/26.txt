We’re raising money for a local charity in east London. Richard House Children’s
Hospice, based in Newham, is a purpose-built children’s hospice caring for
children from across the Capital, Essex, Kent and the Home Counties.
The core purpose of the hospice is to accompany families caring for children
with life-limiting, life-threatening and complex healthcare needs, during their
journey through life to death. The aim is to create positive experiences
along the way that become good memories for the future.
Our national charity is Breast Cancer Campaign, a chari-
ty that works closely with Imperial scientists and does
great work. They aim to have a pioneering approach to
breast cancer research, which identiﬁes and funds the re-
search projects with the greatest potential to save and im-
prove lives and, ultimately, to ﬁnd a cure for breast cancer.
Concern Universal, our international charity, is an in-
ternational development organisation tackling poverty
from the grassroots. They create opportunities for people
around the world to improve their lives and shape their
own futures. By building skills and connecting people at
all levels in society, they help communities deliver practi-
cal solutions with long term impact.
