FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY
10
It’s finally here! STUDENT V
tudents – other than being
the drunken, lazy, selﬁsh
creatures we’re perceived to
be by all those people with
real jobs – are also an amaz-
ing resource. We are young, healthy
(hopefully), intelligent people with a
massive capacity to bring about real
change.
Next week is Student Volunteering
Week; a national week brought to you
by NUS and your very own Imperial
Hub aimed at celebrating the enor-
mous contribution that student vol-
unteers make to their communities
across the country, and inspiring the
next generation of student volunteers.
I can hear what’s going through your
head already – I don’t have time for
this. And I’m not pretending that eve-
ryone has limitless free time to spend
volunteering. I know that Imperial’s
timetable is pretty horrendous. Some
of us eﬀectively have full time jobs
with 9am to 5pm days, as well as so-
cial lives, maybe we play sport, there’s
so much good TV at the moment…
and we enjoy sleep – so where does
volunteering ﬁt in? For most of us, it
doesn’t. This article will hopefully con-
Madeleine Maxwell let’s you know what it’s all about, and why you should care
vince you that it really, really should.
For those of you that have already
pondered this topic, have decided that
it’s not for you, and are thinking about
ﬂipping straight to the centrefold...
Please visit this website: www.sparked.
com to ﬁnd out about micro-volun-
teering. Here, 20 minutes or an hour
of your time can truly make a diﬀer-
ence. The “Sparked” platform involves
matching a “request” from a charity or
individual to a pool of potential “solv-
ers” – the micro-volunteers.
For everyone else, read on to ﬁnd
out why I think we should all volun-
teer.
Discover your passionate side
Spending the afternoon in an old peo-
ple’s home listening to a woman with
a beard repeating the story of her
son’s birth 20 times might be some-
one’s idea of heaven… but maybe it’s
not yours. When you volunteer, you
have to ﬁnd a cause or organisation
that you feel genuinely moved and
motivated by. You will be in a much
better position to learn something, to
make an actual diﬀerence, and have
an impact on those you’re helping if
you’re doing something that you care
about.
It’s a 2-way street
Volunteering undoubtedly leaves you
with that warm tingly feeling that
comes with doing a truly good deed.
So, even though the primary aim of
volunteering should be to help some-
one, or a cause, you ultimately help
yourself too. Volunteering does and
should beneﬁt both the cause AND
the volunteer – it’s about doing good
for others as well as for yourself. Be-
fore you volunteer, think about how
you are going to help, and also ask
yourself “what am I going to gain from
this experience?” Whether it’s devel-
oping skills, meeting people, or just
the warm tingly feeling…(mmm)
Networking
It may seem superﬁcial and contra-
dictory, but networking is incred-
ibly important – not just for corpo-
rations; not just for marketing and
making a proﬁt, but also for individu-
als, and for innovation. Volunteering
is another way to meet a whole range
of people from totally diﬀerent back-
grounds and walks of life. Keeping an
open mind and understanding other
people’s perspectives is essential to
our future development. The peo-
ple you meet volunteering, whether
it’s fellow volunteers or the head of
an NGO, could one day help you to
realise your ambitions. Volunteering
can also supply you with references
for job and internship applications.
Even without the reference, research
by Reed employment found that 73%
employers would hire candidates
who had volunteered over those who
hadn’t.
Don’tabeslaveofcircumstance
How easy is it…You spend all day in
lectures and labs, maybe do a stint
in the Library, eat some dinner…
you eventually have a chance to re-
lax – what do you do? Hang out with
friends? Watch an episode of some-
thing with some really good looking
people in it? And then bed. And the
same thing the next day. And the one
after. Wake up!
Every now and then we need
something new; a fresh perspec-
tive to really shake up our routine
and to push us in a different di-
rection. When you volunteer, you
constantly find yourself in new and
occasionally uncomfortable situa-
tions, and you deal with them. You
become more comfortable with tak-
ing risks and putting yourself out
there, and you grow as a person. You
learn something about yourself too,
maybe a talent you didn’t know you
possessed, a career path you hadn’t
considered...
There are many, many more reasons
why you should volun- t e e r.
But really, you just
have to give it a
go – I bet
you won’t
look back.
F o r
some
m o r e
inspiration,
read on for
some exam-
ples of the
great oppor-
tunities that
exist here at
Imperial.

Great opportunities that you can get involved in...
Student Action for Refugees
Student Action for Refugees (STAR)
at Imperial is part of a national net-
work of students working to improve
the lives of asylum seekers and refu-
gees in the UK though volunteering
and campaigning projects. Students
from Nottingham University original-
ly founded STAR 20 years ago, and the
STAR network now consists of 34 uni-
versity groups – student volunteering
at its best.
Interact
If you’re not sure you can make a regu-
lar commitment, Interact is the soci-
ety for you. They organise a variety
of one-oﬀ, student-led volunteer pro-
jects in the local community around
Imperial. Past opportunities include
helping out at homeless shelters, vis-
iting museums with the elderly and
conservation projects.
Imperial Paediatrics
Imperial Paediatrics is an incredibly
popular new initiative involving stu-
dents from Imperial visiting patients
in the paediatric ward at St. Mary’s
hospital, dedicating their time to mak-
ing inpatients’ stays as happy as pos-
sible.
Talk to me London
As part of Student Volunteering
Week, LSE, UCL and Imperial
are launching a collaborative
project – “Talk to me Lon-
don”. This student-led
campaign aims to tackle
the issue of social iso-
lation by getting Lon-
doners to talk to each
other – on campus,
on the tube… every-
where! Badges saying
“Talk to me London”
along with cards
with conversation
starters have been
designed and will be
distributed throughout
the week – get yours at
the JCR on Wednesday
13th, or come along to the
Talk to me London pub quiz
on Thursday! This project will
hopefully embolden students to
engage with their local community,
and also create a great platform to
discuss the power and impact of stu-
dent volunteering.
I truly believe that the value of volun-
teering, and the attitude that sur-
rounds it – one of respect,
generosity and open-
mindedness – cannot
be underestimated.
The point is: if you
are volunteer-
ing your time
for a cause or
organisation
that you feel
g e nu i n el y
passionate
about, you
don’t be-
grudge this
time spent:
you want to
be there!
We are
students at an
incredibly aca-
demically intense
university – but
also one that values
innovation and interdis-
ciplinary, creative research.
It is important for us to get out
of our comfort zone every now and
again, to reassess our priorities and
perspectives. To stay creative! Get
out there and make a genuine diﬀer-
ence. Learn something about your-
self. Learn something about people.
Become a better person. Spend your
time IMPROVING A SITUATION.
Imagine how well you’re going to
sleep at night… and all this – for free.
Student Volunteering Week is the
perfect opportunity to get involved.
To see the diversity of opportunities
there are out there, and to under-
stand why the volunteering should
play a more central role in all of our
lives. And if you’re too busy next
week, drop us an email or come in
for a chat at the Imperial Hub. You
never know… you might end up feel-
ing just as passionate about student
volunteering, and about the capacity
of student volunteers to make things
happen, as we do.
