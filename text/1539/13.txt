FRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY 13
Picocon 30 at Imperial
The festival turns 30, and this year it’s two whole days!
he Science Fiction, Fan-
tasy and Gothic Horror
Society is preparing for
its annual convention –
Picocon. The convention
has gone from strength to strength
since it started, with this being its
thirtieth anniversary. To celebrate,
Picocon 30 is going to be the ﬁrst ever
two day event in the history of the so-
ciety – taking place over the weekend
of February 16-17.
Given that we are all still here de-
spite last year’s apocalyptic predic-
tions it seems ﬁtting that the theme
for this year’s convention is “Resur-
rection”. Upon arrival guests will be
sorted into three teams, each to do
with life and death – zombies, reapers
and phoenixes. A scavenger hunt for
items such as “a non-Euclidean trian-
gle” and “happiness of greater than
or equal to 0.1M concentration” will
allow people to earn points for their
team.
Other planned activities include
a quiz, silly games, tabletop role-
playing games and the ‘Destruction
of Dodgy Merchandise’. The latter is
a long held tradition Picocon and of-
ten involves liquid nitrogen and large
sledgehammers. Guests are encour-
aged to bring their own contributions
to destroy. In addition, there will be
stalls selling books and oﬃcial Pi-
cocon T-shirt as well as all day LAN
gaming featuring Unreal Tournament
2003 and DEFCON, a game produced
by Introversion – a company set up by
former Imperial students.
The highlight of the day looks set
to be the four guests of honour, who
will be giving individual talks as well
as participating in a group panel.
Peter Hamilton is a bestselling au-
thor whose works, often described
as Space Opera, include elements of
hard SF, fantasy, and classic horror
writing to weave the complex in-
tertwining stories of his characters.
His books have been described by
The Guardian as combining ‘mind-
expanding ideas, deft plotting and
convincing depiction of political in-
trigue” and he has been nominated
for the Clarke, Campbell and BSFA
awards.
Kate Griﬃn is a pen name used by
the twice Carnegie-nominated fan-
tasy author Catherine Webb for her
adult ﬁction. A lifelong Londoner she
is best known for her urban fantasy
Matthew Swift series of novels which
reimagine the city as a centre of hid-
den magical power. SFX magazine
has called it “one of the best fantasy
sagas in years”.
Richard Morgan ﬁrst made his
name with the Takeshi Kovacs series
of cyberpunk novels — the ﬁrst of
which, Altered Carbon, was recently
voted the ﬁfth best SF novel of the
21st century (so far) by readers of Lo-
cus magazine — but has also shown
himself skilled in working with other
formats. He is credited as the writer
for the videogames Crysis 2 and the
2012 remake of Syndicate. He has also
worked for Marvel comics, writing
two Black Widow mini-series. He has
won both the Clarke and Campbell
awards, and his latest work is the A
Land Fit for Hope fantasy novel series.
Steph Swainston is the author of
the highly acclaimed Castle fantasy
series, described as “unique and chal-
lenging” by Clarkesworld magazine.
Heavily inﬂuenced by William Bur-
roughs and M. John Harrison her
work also draws on her experience of
academic life.
The Write Fantastic collective; in-
cluding Juliet McKenna, Kari Sper-
ring, Ian Whates and others; will
also be in attendance, providing two
T
panels on the Saturday – “Overcom-
ing Death Through Science” and “Life
after Death in SF”. On Sunday after-
noon they will be running a series of
drop in Writers Workshop sessions.
All are welcome to attend with
weekend entry £15 for students, £10
for society members and £20 for oth-
ers. Doors open at 10am on both days
for what promises to be an exciting
event, and not just for fans of fantasy
and science ﬁction.
