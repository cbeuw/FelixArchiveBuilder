Surrey 3 — IC 3
IC extended their unbeaten
run in the last divisional
UAU to finish top of their
group after tying a match
that demonstrated the
squads team spirit and
ability to play under
pressure.
After Cox and Lang, our
top two, had extended their
unbeaten runs our hopes of
victory were high. But the
news came in from the
fifteenth of defeats for both
Gamblin and Tierney.
The powerful postgrad 2
up after 14 held his game
to win at the last — the
only team member with
100%. Where was Morris?
Four down on the twelfth
he won on the 12, 13, 15.
Unfortunately he was
beaten by the darkness and
conceeded on 17.

IC v Brunei
Suddenly they were there.
The miles of M4, urban
highway and treacherous
twisting backroads had
unraveled and IC Bowling
sped into the Heathrow
Bowl car park in a shower
of dirt and body parts. 'Go
for it boys!' snapped
Captain Wheeldon, cliche-
master extraordinaire, and
the teams swept through
the doors, balls swinging,
(non-sexist, as we didn't
have a ladies team this
time. All you girls out there
remember, fast cars, wild
things and faraway places
await you).
Suddenly they were
playing. Polyester and
rubber clashed with wood.
Pins flew. Tasos's arms
waved. The A team (So
called because of an
unfortunate superficial
resemblance between BA
Baracus and Eric) swept to
victory, cruising the craven
Brunei spawn beneath their
designer shoes.
The unopposed Brunei
ladies actually turned in the
oppositions best
performance of the day
giving them an automatic
two points, but to no avail.
Suddenly they were
gone, on a rusty wing and
a prayer leaving an
emotional vacuum in
passing, the voices of those
who had witnessed their
first victory in living
memory hushed with awe,
a single phrase on their
lips, 'Who were those
masked men?'

On Saturday the Imperial
College Fencing team took
part in the UAU South
Eastern region mens team
events, and won. The team
of seven swordsmen beat
firstly University of East
Anglia and then University
College to get the home
draw against the second
placed team from the South
West.
The match with UEA was
the expected whitewash.
The foil team won their
section of the match 8-1
and the epee completed the
coup-de-grace 6-3. The
sabre match did not need

right victories required.
UC gave a similar
treatment to Surrey
University and after lunch
the real fight was on. U C
have a very strong foil team
and we were happy to take
three bouts from them
including a classic 5-0
victory by Rich Jarvis- The
IC strength lay in sabre and
epee and the sabre team
returned an excellent 7-2
win. Less than twenty hits
were made on our
sabreurs. Four bouts were
required by the epeeists
and should have been
made without loss. Two
unfortunate 5-4 defeats for
the captain meant it took
six bouts to assure victory
by 4 bouts to 2. The final
score was 14-10.

IC Hockey 1sts won the South-eastern division of the UAU
by beating City 4-1 on penalty flicks. As a result they
qualified for the last sixteen of the UAU national rounds
And so it came to pass that
the almighty Captain Tony
spoke unto his people of
the challenge from Exeter,
and so the sailors did go to
Exeter, where they did unto
us what we did unto
Cambridge last week.
And on the first day
Commodore Phil said 'let
there be wind', and there
was wind..eventually,
following the efforts of Mai,
Daniel and Ape, After the
delayed start, 2 of our
boats ably manned (and
womaned) by Tony and
Maurice, Pete and Karen,
shot at lightning speed to
the front of the fleet.
Despite a fierce struggle,
they maintained this
position, confident in the
knowledge that there was
unfaltering back-up from
the rear, by Helen and
Sam. Thus, a resounding
victory to Imperial.
Cross
Country
Over the first few weeks of
term the Cross-country
club has had four outings,
meeting with quite
reasonable success, and
some notable
performances, although
some members have been
more notable by their
absence! After a precursory
outing to Bath for the
Reeboek League the first
major event of the season
was the London Colleges
League at Parliament Hill.
Mike 'Never Again on a
Wednesday' Ball impressed
the UL Seclectors by
finishing 5th, and some
solid performances by
those illustrious committee
boys; Lee, Waterson and
Gamblin assured a first
team victory finishing 13th,
16th and 19th respectively,
inspite of fifth counter in
94th.
Last Wednesday though,
the rot set in Mike Never
Again on a Wednesday'
Ball lived up to his name,
and in spite of the efforts of
the aforementioned
illustrious committee boys,
slumped to fifth in the
London Colleges League
2nd race at Trent Park,
although we still head the
league overall.
Not forgetting our
solitary lady, Sue Waters
for her staunch support so
far, but she needs some
company (in the ladies
race, that is!)—come on
girls, give it a try! 1
FELIX Friday 22 November 13
