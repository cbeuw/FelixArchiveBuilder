Comets
Recent exploration of the
solar wind and the earth's
magnetosphere by Debbie
Wilkes
On September 11 1985 the
International Cometary
Explorer passed through
the tail of the Giacobini-
Zinner comet, and so
became the first spacecraft
to be involved in a direct
encounter with a comet.
Imperial Cbllege Space
Physics group, headed by
Dr David Southwood, were
deeply involved with this
project, having provided
the energetic ion detector
carried by this spacecraft.
Remarkably, one year to
the day earlier, the Active
Magnetospheric particle
Tracer Explorers
programme created the first
man-made comet. Once
again, the Space Physics
group were involved,
having developed the
magnetometer carried by
the UK spacecraft.
The three satellites in the
latter mission, collectively
known as the Active
Magnetospheric Particle
Tracer Explorers (AMTE),
were launched from the
Kennedy Space Centre at
Cape Canavaral, on the
16th August 1984. AMPTE
was a joint mission of the
United States, West
Germany and the United
Kingdon; with each of
these national teams
providing a spacecraft. The
mission carried out a series
of experiments designed to
investigate the interaction
of the solar wind with the
Earth's magnetosphere,
which is the most distant
part of the earth's
atmoshere. In this region,
the Earth's magnetic field
greatly influences
behaviour, and so a
magnetometer to measure
the field is a key instrument
on a mission of this type.
The space Physics group,
in collaboration with the
University of California Los
Angeles provided the
magnetometer carried by
the British spacecraft, An
artist's impression of the
UK Craft, showing the
magnetometer, can be seen
in Fig 1.
This instrument, which is
capable of measuring
magnetic fields as small as
1/50,000th of the field at
the Earth's surface, is set
on a boom one metre from
the body of the craft to
minimise the effect of stray
fields from the spacecraft
material and operating
electrical equipment. At all
stages in the mission
magnetic field
measurements played a
central role in the
investigations.

particles in the
magnetosphere, much of
the fundamental physics
remains to be understood.
Two of the most intriguing
problems are centred on
how some solar wind ions
can penetrate the barrier
formed by the Earth's
magnetic field, and how
these particles can become
accelerated, in some cases
resulting in the spectacular
Aururae Borealis and
Australis.
The unique feature of the
AMPTE Mission was to
release tracer ions, namely
lithium and barium, in an
attempt to investigate the
entry of solar wind particles
into the magnetosphere,

The continuous flow of
particles from the sun into
interplanetary space is
termed the solar wind; it
consists of electrons,
protons, helium nuclei and
other ionised material
which pass from the Sun
through the Solar System
and eventually merge into
the general intersteller
medium. The
magnetosphere forms a
tear shaped cavity in the
solar wind, where the
matter is fully ionised ie in
the plasma state. While a
great deal is known about
the structure and dynamics
of this gas of charged
and their subsequent
transport. All previous
missions had only carried
out passive measurements.
In between the active ion
release phases of the
mission, the three
spacecraft made passive
measurements on the
Earth's ionised outer
atmophere. Although a
great deal of data still
remains to be analysed,
there has already been a
major breakthrough in our
understanding of how the
solar wind interacts with
the Earth's magnetosphere.
The American spacecraft
was equipped with a
comprehensive set of
instrumentation to detect
the mass and charge
compositon of the
magnetopshere. Its task
during the ion release
experiments was to monitor
whether test ions released
by the German craft, into
the solar wind upstream of
the Earth's magnetosphere,
penetrated to its orbit deep
in the magnetosphere.
During these experiments
the British spacecraft was
situtated close to the
German craft to monitor
the local effects of ion
release. On the 11th and
20th of September 1984 the
first minute quantities of
lithium were released,
initially producing some
artificial cometary effects.
But, it was on 27 December
1984 that a barium release
led to the German craft
being enveloped in what
was heralded as the first
'artificial comet'; a cloud of
ionised barium 5,000km
long, which was actually
observable from the
ground, see fig 2. This use
of the solar wind to mimic
some aspects of cometary
behaviour, such as solar
wind deflection and tail
formation, is very
interesting as the existence
of the solar wind was first
predicted to explain
cometary tail formation.
However a more complete
understanding of comets
could only come about by
actual spacecraft
encounters with real
comets.
In September of this year
the International Cometary
Explorer (ICE) became the
first spacecraft involved in
a direct encounter with a
comet, when it passed
within 8,000km of the
nucleus of Giacobini-
Zinner. ICE was originally
launched by NASA in 1978
as the International Sun-
Earth Explorer 3 (ISEE 3)
and was designed to
investigate the solar wind
and particles. By
redirecting a spaceship that
had already completed its
original mission, NASA was
able to keep the cost of the
project down to 3 million
dollars; as compared to 500
million dollars if a purpose
built craft had been used
The Imperial College
Space Physics group
provided the energetic ion
instrument which was used
to measure the ions created
by the comet, these
observations provided the
first evidience of the
approach of Giacobine-
Zinner in the ICE date.
Results from the mission
have shown the Comet's
atmosphere results from
sublimation of the icy
surface material of the
nucleus. This then
undergoes complex
photochemical reactions
with sunlight, which leads
to break up and ionisation
of the inital molecules. The
result have already ended
30 years of speculation on
the nature of solar wind-
comet interactions but it
will be many more months
before all the data can be
analysed, and the full
implications realised.
Having survived this
encounter the International
cometary Explorer is now
moving on to the
rendevous with Halley's
comet in March 1986.
Where, it will carry out
investigations upstream of
the comet at the same time
as Giotto (the European
craft) and Vega (The
Russian mission) encounter
the nucleus.
