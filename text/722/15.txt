Flagship
For Sale
Research at IC featured in
a misleading article
published in 'Computing'
last week, suggesting that
the Alvey Flagship
supercomputer research
was about to be sold to
major US defence
contractors. This research
includes work on new
architectures for intelligent
knowledge-based systems.
The article stated that a
delegation from US military
suppliers, United
Technologies, had had at
least two meetings with IC
staff involved in Alvey
projects, and had asked
them about government
policy as well as about
areas of research in which
IC is a recognised leader. A
further meeting was
reported to have been
cancelled at short notice
after an open letter to Mrs
Thatcher, signed by several
IC researchers, rejecting
UK involvement in Star
Wars. 'Sources at Imperial'
were quoted as saying that
there is strong resistance
at IC to taking part in a
Star Wars project. Closing
the article was a complaint
from Labour MP Chris
Smith that the government
should make sure research
results were made good
use of rather than being
sold abroad.
Prof Sayers, Head of the
Department of Computing
at IC, described the article
as 'inaccurate and
somewhat speculative'. He
confirmed that the
American delegation had
visited IC and had spoken
to Dr Phelps, the Pro-
Rector for External
Developments. Members of
the Computing department
had met the delegation, but
Prof Sayers had not been
present. He was also
unaware of any staff having
spoken to the Press on the
subject.
Prof Sayers expressed
the opinion that the
connection with the US
Military was
overemphasised in the
article, as they were still
negotiating with potential
industrial partners. He also
felt that selling the Alvey
research abroad would be
unwise, considering that
this research had originally
been intended to put
Britain back 'on the
defence scene'.
Channel Crossing
The 149th annual CCU coxless threes raft race was won
by RCS last Sunday. Guilds were a close second and
Mines, whose raft only just managed to cross the
Serpentine, a distant third. Earlier, RCS were also
victorious in the three-way tug-of-war. RCS first combined
forces with Mines to dispose of the Guilds team, and then
beat Mines in the final.
Star Wars II
'There is no scientist who
believes President Reagan's
SDI project can ever work',
or at least no one who Prof
Ralston, Professor of
Computer Science and
Mathematics at the State
University of New York,
knows of. Prof Ralston,
who is curently visiting the
Department of Computing,
spoke to 60 staff and
students at Tuesday's 'Star
Wars' CND meeting, where
he addressed the political,
financial and social aspects
of the SDI program.
He went to add that, in
his opinion, the project is
'intellectually dishonest'
and almost everyone in
favour of it (President
Reagan excepted) believes
that it cannot work.
He blames this
intellectual dishonesty on
the large financial rewards,
which, in his words, 'warp
the judgement of
professionals'.
He finished by discussing
Star Wars research in
universities, and he
expressed the opinion that
universities should not be
involved in 'mission
orientated' research,
particularly Star Wars.
Prof Lehman did not
attend the meeting.
Hockey
Success
IC Hockey 1st XI won the
south-eastern division of
the UAU championship by
beating City University 4-1
on penalty flicks. As a
result they qualified for the
last sixteen of the UAU.
Ticket
Heist
Two hundred tickets for
Guilds Carnival
disappeared from the
Union Office. Will anyone
holding tickets numbered
101 to 300, please contact
the Union immediately.
Another Bar
Story
A new food/wine/beer Bar
is opening in the Real Ale
Bar, Southside on Monday
at 12 noon. On offer will be
baked potatoes and freshly
baked pizzas, both with a
choice of toppings. There
will also be a cold buffet
and a variety of filled rolls
and pies. Opening times
are the same as those of
the Southside Bar.
Falkland's
Factor
Mr Tarn Dalyell MP spoke
for 40 minutes yesterday on
the subject for which he is
best known, the sinking of
the General Belgrano. In
his talk which was
delivered without notes, he
reiterated all of the
arguments for which he has
already been given a great
deal of publicity. He again
accused the Prime Minister,
Mrs Thatcher of 'gross
deception, lying and
calculated murder', and
justified this because, he
asserted, he was duty
bound to show up the
political misbehavour of the
government in the name of
democracy.
The rest of his talk was
mainly taken up with the
crisis in education in this
country at present, and
how a future Labour
government would seek to
rebuild and reinforce that
which the Tory government
had undermined and
destroyed. He suggested
that an injection of cash
was what was needed and
that this money could
possibly come from the
three million pounds per
day which is presently
being spent in keeping a
garrison in the Falklands.
He also suggested that
money was needed to fund
research projects, and
more specfically pure
research. He acknowledged
that Imperial was not really
lacking in this area owning
to the industrial backing it
attracts. Other universities,
however, had difficulty in
raising money, especially
for research projects
without obvious
applications.
Ghost Story
A masked man carrying a
bucket, thought to be the
Phantom Soaker, was
pursued into the J C R by a
group of students. During
the struggle which
followed, an unidentified
QT gunmen fired a volley
of shots. The Phantom fell
clutching his bleeding
chest, and was quickly
dragged away.
'This was obviously a
professional job', said PC
Andy Nimmons. Chief
Security Officer Geoffrey
Reeves was too upset to
comment.
