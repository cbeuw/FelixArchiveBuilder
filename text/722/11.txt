IC 2 — Surrey 1
IC 1sts won yet another
very important match last
Wednesday. By beating
Surrey University 2—1, IC
' finished their first round
UAU matches at the top of
; the group with maximum
i points.
The match was played on
i a very grassy pitch and
;
with the sun very low. This
made the umpires' job very
difficult and therefore
: contributed to the match
; becoming very heated with
i the three sticks being
' broken, and much dissent
' (mainly from Surrey)
Nick Hope scored the
first goal after a goal-
:
mouth scramble and later
: forced a penalty flick which
I Ian Parker put home. The
[last ten minutes saw Surrey
;
score their only goal, from
: a very fine angle.
IC 2nds 0 — BA 1
The seconds fielded the
same side this week
exhibiting a degree of
consistency unprecedented
in second XI history.
However, despite this novel
tactic they were unlucky to
lose 1-0 in a closely fought
tussle with British Airways.
The opposition looked
fine in their splendid red,
white and blue livery
looking more as if they
belonged in one of British
Airways new commercials.
The seconds looked as
ragged as ever.
Well, anyway to cut a
long story short-we was
beatl Duncan and Grant
had an excellent game in
defence as well as Josh
and Andy in midfield. The
forward line came so close
on so many occasions it
was a miracle we didn't
score. In fact everyone
played so bloody well how
the hell did we lose this
one?

RSM 4 — LSE 3
Surprisingly played on a
Friday night (I?) at
Willesden Sports Centre,
this interdivisional battle
turned out to be the best
hockey Mines have played
in a long time. LSE took on
early lead with a well taken
short corner, and

consolidated their position
with a second goal. Not to
be disheartened Mines kept
plugging away with the
simple passes, and a well
structured attacking move
led to Dave Jennings
putting one in the back of
the net. Lifted by this goal,
RSM.kept up the pressure
which was rewarded by a
late short corner. The move
saw LSE still scrambling off
their back line, with the ball
in the back of the net.
With the final score at 2-2
an extra 30 minutes was
due. LSE after a fine
display of football, put their
third goal in which was
swiftly followed by another
goal from Dave Jennings.
The game was decided
when Max Michaeles
single-handedly dribbled
into the D and scored to
put Mines 4-3 up. The
superb defensive play of
Simon and Simon was able
to hold off LSE until the
final whistle.
Badminton
Surrey 2 — IC Ladies 7
Surrey were undoubtably
the strongest team that IC
have played this year —
they managed to win 2
rubbers thus making the
final score a 7-2 win for IC.
This of course means
that IC have now qualified
for the knockout round
(last 16)

IC 1sts 3 — Goldsmiths 2
IC maintained their 100%
winning league record by
scoring a 3-2 victory in a
bruising encounter against
last season's league
winners, Goldsmith's.
In a match littered with
late tackles, IC took the
lead after 15 minutes when
Paul Bravery crossed to the
far post where Alex Lunghi
headed powerfully home
from 6 yards, 1-0. Straight
from the re-start though
Goldsmith's equalised. IC
regained the lead 10
minutes later when Alex
Lunghi's persistence paid
off allowing him to drill the
ball home from the edge of
the penalty box.
Just before half time IC
were reduced to 10 men
with Bryce Goldsbrough
having to go off, the victim
of a scything late tackle.
Undaunted by this, IC
proceeded to play some of
their best football of the
season making a mockery
of their being one man
short and duly increased
their lead when a Lawrence
Covill free-kick found Paul
Bravery 25 yards out who
hit a dipping shot past an
unsighted keeper. IC
continued to dominate but
allowed Goldsmiths a
second goal, on the stroke
of full time, making the
result a lot closer than the
match itself.
Surrey 2 IC 1st 2
IC needed to beat unbeaten
Surrey by three clear goals
to qualify from the SE
regional division of the
national UAU tournament
but this in the end proved
too much despite a battling
performance.
Goals from Tom Dutton,
Guy Poppy were not
enough to give IC victory in
a match that was often bad
tempered and saw one IC
player sent off.
IC 6ths 5 — UC 7ths 3
IC won a notable victory on
Saturday against the team
who beat them 7-2 the
previous week. Goals by
John Galloway, Eddy
Hodnet and Hidio Takano
were enough to ensure
victory.
BSH 8 — Southwell 0
Bernard Sunley House kept
their 100% record for this
season with their second
big win, 8—0 against
Southwell.
The game started fast for
BSH but a goal was not
forthcoming until 20 mins
into the game when
captain, Steve Wilkinson,
managed to slip one under
the keeper. From then on
Bernard Sunley kept up the
attacks with another 3
hitting the net before half-
time. The BSH keeper did
actually touch the ball 3
times during the first
period, back-passes and a
limp shot.
The second half started
differently with Southwell
making several breakaway
attacks but none brought
the keeper into action.
Byron Wood knocked in a
great shot from a
seemingly impossible angle
and Ken Sayers also put
away a good one.
By this time BHS had got
tired of attacking and
decided to let Southwell do
some. They hit the bar from
a wild slice and the keeper
had to make a mad slide off
his line to take a low cross
but Southwell did not really
look like scoring.
Special thanks must go
to Tony in the Southwell
goal for attempting to make
a match of it and also to
Steve Wilkinson, the
Bernard Sunley captain,
who, had he taken half of
his chances, would have
doubled the score.
Team: P Brooks-
Johnson, R Jaes, N
Wolstenhome, M Shepherd,
L Covill, S James, J
Fawcett, K Sayers, A
Watson, B Wood, S
Wilkinson (Capt), Sub R
Trengove.
