Norman and the
Nutburgers
The Smoking Concert
The curtain rises. The
audience squeals in
anticipation. Then the
audience stops squealing.
You see, this isn't just any
ordinary band playing any
ordinary gig—this is Norman
and the Nutburgers, and so
onstage there is some
confusion. Quite a lot of
confusion, in fact.
'Are they ready?' asks the
ighting man. Nobody seems
to know, least of all the band,
who are stumbling about on
stage trying to work out
which instrument they're
supposed to be playing.
Finally some sort of order
emerges: Norman's bass is
hanging just above his knees,
Duncan, resplendent in
underpants,
plastic apron
and chef's hat, sits behind his
drum kit, Andy sways slightly,
clutching at his guitar, Roo
and Karin look extremely
embarrassed, and Charlie
stands centre stage, a
solitary, heroic figure, a
faraway look in his eyes. He
is trying to remember the
words. Suddenly he snatches
at his microphone, shouts
'One! Two! Three! Four!'..and
they're off!
There is a certain aura
about Norman and the
Nutburgers, an unexplainable
air of mystery that somehow
digs to the very fibre of their
beings. Perhaps it's the
sunglasses. Perhaps it's
because they can barely
stand, let alone play. Perhaps
it's because Charlie can't
sing to save himself.
Whatever it is, the audience
love it—feet a tapping
everywhere, they're dancing
in the aisles, on the window
ledges, in the chairs. 'The
first person to come down to
the front chews a mike stand,'
growls Charlie, and sure
enough, a whole crowd of
people rush forward...
Frankly I can't understand
why anyone likes this band.
But they do. Even I like them,
despite everything my mother
told me. Amazing, yes, but
true!
Norman and the
Nutburgers play absolutely
their last gig ever in
Southside Bar, next Thursday
night. Don't miss it!
I'm sure it is possible to learn
a great deal about a society
from the films it produces.
The output from America is
often fast, exciting and just as
frequently trivial and
superficial, and as talented as
American are at quickening
the pulse, they, largely, seem
to have left the remaining
wide spectrum of human
emotions to be covered by
the rest of the world. The
Eastern Europeans seem
especially adept at producing
some very human stories, a
particularly fine example of
this is the Yugoslavian 'When
Father Was Away on
Business'.
The title refers to a
euphemsm used to describe
those who have been sent
away for having criticised the
regime in some way. The
victim in this case is the
father of Malik, a six year old
through whose eyes the story
is related. The father has
made some indiscrete
comments about the
propaganda having gone to
far to a mistress who casually
relates them to a party
official, resulting in a period
of forced labour. The lot, as
such, is simply about the
trials and tribuations of Malik
and his family, the mother,
the father and his inventive
brother and it covers the
period from Malik's
circumcision in 1950 to his
forced labour
being chosen, for reasons of
academic success, to present
a baton to the Major two
years later, this being the
length of his father's
sentence.
The real delight of this film
is that everyone, right down
to the guard with two lines
and ten seconds of screen
time, is a natural actor with
an innate sense of timing and
delivery. But expecially
worthy is the young Malik
whose wonderful
performance instils emotions
that far more experienced
actors would have trouble,
and may never suceed, in
doing. It is quite simply a
lovely film and I urge you to
rush along to it's opening
tonight at Cannon's new
Premiere cinema at what
used to be Scene Swiss
Centre.
Conveniently, to illustrate
the point about national
characteristics further,
another of Cannon's releases
this week is 'The Boys Next
Door', an account of how a
couple of 'regular guys' can
go spare and reek havok. In
order to lend credibility to the
story the film opens with
some stills of mass murders
and some of the things that
these apparently normal
people had said, and it ends
with a newspaper-like
photograph of the survivor of
the two kids that the story
centres on.
Bo and Roy, just graduated,
have one weekend before
they spend the rest of there
lives in a dead-end job in a
factory, so they decide to
drive to LA for a holiday.
They are misfits who
mass murderers
apparently have no emotional
envolvement with school,
family or peers and whilst
driving to L.A. Roy, Maxwell
Caulfied, also reveals that
'angry stuff that he has inside
himself. Inspite of moments
of conscience Bo, Charlie
Sheen (another talented son
of Martin Sheen), goes along
with Roy as their pranks
become more serious finaly
leading to several murders.
To emphasise the normality
f
of these two kids they are
contrasted against some of
the more colourful
inhabitants of the L.A.
nightlife but I couldn't help
feeling that if these two
sexist, racist bigots were
considered normal then
America has some real
problems. As one reactionaly
cop says 'everyone's got gins
thee days, they're more
popular then sex'. But as a
comment on the need to
spend more time preparing
the young for life and on how
the strong willed can
influence the weak, the film
may have some value, but as
entertainment I'm afraid I'm
not so sure.
on Swan's way by a escaped
swan, the brothers' grief is
profound and obsessive and
it causes them to become
involved with the driver of the
car, Alba Van Meegeren, the
surgeon who amputted Alba's
leg after the accident, then
conspires to remove her
remaining one, and
conspiracies at the zoo
deepen into an exotic game
of barter and blackmail as
In complete contrast 'A Zed
and Two Noughts', like Peter
Greenaway's last major film
'The Draughtsman's
Contract', is an intricate and
complex film with allusions
to just about everything.
To convey his ideas on
chance, symmetry and
evolution, Greenaway centres
his story on two brothers
working in a zoo. After their
wives are killed in a car crash
fin'* . n
various characters collude
with or against the brothers'
increasingly subversive
activities, one of the aims of
which is to free the animals.
The brothers, Oliver and
Oswald Deuce (the two
noughts) slowly become
more and more similar
throughout the film, until we
finally discover why.
The film itself owes a great
deal to the Dutch painter
Vermeer in the characters
names; Caterina Bolnes was
Vermeers wife, and Van
Meegeren his prime faker,
and also in gestures, picture
detail, lighting and
composition, a major feature
of which is twinship and
The Abortion: an historical
romance 1966
A Weird book about some
very peculiar people who
inhabit an even stranger
American library. It is set in
the time when abortions were
illegal in the USA and women
requiring one went to
Mexico-much as Irish women
make the trip over to England
today.
Into this cloud-cuckooland
enter various authors with
their lives' manuscripts-
imagine a place where a
sixteen-year old boy could
bring a book on masterbation
entitled 'The other side of my
hand','or an elderly woman
bring a book on growing
flowers in windowless hotel
rooms by candlelight. Among
them is Vida, a woman who
hates her beautiful body, and
(of course) has written a
book about it. She and the
librarian, a really off-beat
character, have sex because
there doesn't seem to be
anything else to do. They are
far too dopey to use any
contraceptives, hence Viola
becomes pregnant and they
take the plane to Mexico.
The whole business is
pretty gruesome but
Brautigan manages to be
non-condemnatory; the only
conclusion is 'think before
you act'. The prose style
takes a bit of getting used to,
not being the typical Great
English Novel genre, and the
author, Richard Brautigan, is
obviously a very lazy writer
since most of the book is
blank pages. The aim of a
large part of the book is
supposed to be character
sketching; the only problem
being that they aren't
sketched. If you can put up
with these shortcomings and
tolerate the odd ball
inhabitants then you'll find
yourself at the anticlimax of
an ending before you've
realised that the story has
begun. Published by Picador,
For a change, it's a
pleasure to read a well
written story with believable
developing characters and a
definate plot. The L-shaped
Room by Lynne Reid Banks
is based around Jane a 'nice'
middle class girl. Verging on
twenty-eight she decides to
have a first and last fling with
an old flame and ends up
pregnant. Bravely she makes
the decision not to have an
abortion, though her father
does the self-righteous
patriach act and throws her
out of home, so she finds the
most dingy tenement bedsit
possible to bear her child in.
Considering herself a reject
by society's double
standards, Jane is surprised
by the caring friends she
makes in her new life.
Inevitably some sideways
looks and snide remarks are
forthcoming. The book is set
in the 1950's after all, but I
felt that an untruthfuly rosey
picture of unmarried
motherhood was painted.
Jane was fortunate in not
only having a well-paid job to
go back to, but also friends
willing and able to help her.

As is probably apparent it
is a film that deserves to be
seen and not written about
and this is possible at the
London Film Festival (at the
National Film Theatre) on the
30th November or at the
Lumiere from the 5th
December, and it really ought
to be seen, for as Greenway
says,'Cinema is far to rich
and capable a medium to be
merely left to the storytellers'.
