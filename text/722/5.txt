I was sitting in the office
this morning minding my
own business when in runs
Southey yelling something
about Ratfink's been run
over by a car and would
someone else write Below
the Belt. Well no sooner
could I ask where to put
my small ad form than here
I am forcibly sat at the desk
with a lot of illegible copy
trying to cobble it into
something coherent.
Anyway what follows is as
close as I could get to a
weeks gossip at IC.
Friday saw the one day in
the year when the
rumoured 25% gay
population of IC can
mingle unashamedly with
their friends without the
conventional restrictions on
dress, Rag and Drag disco.
And unless the usual
blackmail payments are
forthcoming we will publish
the names of those union
officers who didn't have to
go out and get suspender
belts!
Saturday night probably
saw a party in the flat of
two notable C C U hacks
where half of RCS were
seen to get off with the
same Guilds fresher, half of
Guilds were seen having
oral sex with a well known
life scientist in the lounge
and three miners spent the
evening lacing drinks with
human urine. Guilds
President Roger Preece
was also seen in a merry
state that evening; our
Roger was seen trying to
gain admittance to a party
at a Mews flat near College
at a thoroughly ridiculous
hour of the morning. (This
item carried with it the
following note 'The fools
still haven't caught him
knocking off a woman').
For Sunday there is a list
of who was 'bonking' in
which room in Selkirk but
this has been made illegible
opposite three numbers.
Monday most of the
people worth writing about
were simply pissed at the
Drink-a-pub-dry and
incapable of doing much
apart from vomit on cars,
embassies, mews flats,
beds and all the other
places reserved for such
activity. There is also a
note from someone
Newman claiming that a
person in Linstead is
smoking cannabis—what
tripe!
Tuesday was the Dirty
Disco at which a certain
well known C C U officer
managed to obtain some
distinctly perverse services
by claiming that the object
beneath his mack was
really a banana. Again
there is a one week
deadline for a contribution
to Rag or we publish the
names of those concerned.
Also observed Tuesday
were two ex-RCS hacks
selling an Oxo cube to a
Mines rugby player. Can it
be coincidence that the
latter was seen seeking an
M Newman in Life Sci?
Wednesday morning is
when this crap has to be
printed by, but already
today those likely lads from
Guilds are at it. Early this
morning while collecting
obnoxious material for
Morphy Dag our heroes
managed narrowly to avoid
writing off their van in the
Thames and later found
themselves locked in
Billingsgate market; keep it
up lads. Finally, I am
apparently not allowed to
claim that Rob Northey is
the phantom soaker. So
instead I'll note that our
illustrious editor is showing
distinct signs of discomfort
when ever the 'Chelsea Fat
Man' investigation is
mentioned. What do you
mean I'm supposed to
make it all up?!
