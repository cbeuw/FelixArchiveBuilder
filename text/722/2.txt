Vandalism
Last Saturday the Union
Bar was apparently
smashed by sportsmen who
had been involved in the
RSM v Cardiff sports
games. Every year when
RSM play either
Cambourne or Cardiff at
home some part of the
College gets smashed up.
Sport is about playing hard
on the field and then
socialising off it. It isn't
about smashing the place
up. Hopefully, anyone
caught vandalising the the
Union will be disciplined
and Cardiff will be sent a
bill. This, though, is not
enough. Sports fixtures
with teams who have
vandalised the Union
should be cancelled.
Tradition is no reason to
continue sports fixtures
that result, as Saturday's
did, in significant damage
to the Union and the early
ending of two well attended
and peaceful events.
Sex Special
The Sex Supplement is a
new idea. Please come and
tell me what you think. If
you like the idea of
supplements, we're
considering printing several
next term. People have
suggested that we run
specials on style, hippy
culture and nuclear
disarmament.
Union Snack Bar
The Union snack bar will
now be open from 5.30pm
until 7pm every
Wednesday. If you play
sport on Wednesdays and
feel hungry after the game,
why not go and eat at
Norman's.
New Bar
Rob Northey is opening a
new wine bar in the
Southside Real Ale Bar
(next to Southside Bar)
serving decent pizzas (ie
ones made to order rather
than crap ones that are
served in the refectories)
etc on Monday. Give it try
it could become the place
to eat.
Rag
Rag Week is still in
progress. The 1,000,001
down darts will be taking
place all weekend. Go
along and support by
throwing a few darts and
go to the RCSU office and
pick forms so that you can
get sponsors.
Carnival looks set to be a
massive success. Be part of
the success by turning up
and supporting the event.
C C U s are organising a
rag collection tomorrow.
Turn up at one of the C C U
offices at 10am. There is a
magnum of Champagne for
the highest collector.
Photosoc
FELIX and Photosoc are
running a photo
competition. To enter you
don't have to be a member
of Photosoc. All you have
to do is submit a portfolio
of colour or black and
white photos to the FELIX
office before the start of
term.

STOIC: The Sequel
Dear Hugh,
In reply to your Editorial
comment about the STOIC
'All Nighter', I would like to
make clear one or two
points.
1) Electrical Engineering do
not control the TV Studio.
2) I made it very clear to
the current STOIC
chairman that over-all
approval would have to be
obtained before such an
event could take place. It is
not my fault that they
published details before
doing so!
3) STOIC do not own the
TV Studio.
4) The studio is here to
provide a production
service to all departments
in Imperial College (and
has done so since 1976).
STOIC is lucky to have
such facilities available to
them and at times does not
appreciate the very low
studio charge being made
to them and the time which
I put in on Tuesday and
Thursday evenings and
during Wednesday
evenings (sometimes up to
9pm) for the making of
Newsbreak—all this is
unpaid time on my behalf
(you don't hear me
complaining about that!).
I feel that STOIC is
becoming like a spoiled
child and that efforts; and
time making 'All Nighters'
could be better spent on
improving what purports to
be a News-magazine
programme.
Regards,
Colin Grimshaw,
Production Manager,
TV Studio.
PS Why don't you do a
Feature on the College TV
Studio, and show what it
does do!!
Dear Hugh,
After last week's decision it
has never been so obvious
how much college hostility
there is towards STOIC.
Not only that but the
minimal Studio time that
the union can afford has
reduced programme output
by 25%, causing complaints
from the viewers.
If the Union think
College will subsidize
STOIC like it did that
famous row-boat it is
mistaken. Yet again the
UFC has postponed the five
year planned Studio
upgrade—probably until
STOIC is actually kicked
out of the College Studio,
which after years of
inactivity has found more
profitable pursuits than
producing student
activities.
Come on folks lets have
a few quid to produce
things you want to watch
ie films, vidios, time
switched programmes and
of course the type of union
reports you saw on Guilds
other video.
Yours tired of taking this shit
Richard Copnall.
FELIX: The Boredom
Dear FELIX Editor,
BLOODY BORING—this is
how we feel about recent
editions of our wonderful
paper FELIX!
Its OK to have the
occasional article of
political/serious discussion
however this needs to be
spiced up with an equal
amount of:-
SCANDAL, ADVENTURE,
NAUGHTINESS ETC.
Go read The Sun I hear
you cry—well we do! But it
would be nice to think we
could also enjoy reading
the College paper each
Friday after all it is
supposed to be written for
us.
People at IC aren't all
politically active, socially
aware, or even remotely
interested in anything of
the sort. Lets face it some
of the people at IC are
fairly unhinged but this
does not mean that they
shouldn't be catered for:-
What's wrong with
articles about err... Rhino's
willies (have you seen the
size of them?), Lesbian
cows (they really do go far!
you know) and the sex
appeal of bald headed
economics lecturers
(wooooo!)
So it might provoke cries
of rudeness, irrelevance etc
etc.. So What!
It might be that people
have been too apathetic to
contiribute any articles to
FELIX. However I think this
reflects on the editor—if
you included interesting
exciting articles, you might
get interesting exciting
articles written for you. If
you continue to publish the
political ramblings of one
or two people we might
think that's all you wanted.
It is not only the subjects
of the articles but also the
boring nature of the
2 Friday 22 November FELIX
