Small Is Beautiful
Several students obviously
found the Union bar rather
warm on Monday evening.
Dave Page. Simon Redlich.
Symon Corns and IC.U
Deputy President Dave
Kingston decided to reveal
all and paraded naked on
one of the bar tables
Several women who were
present commented that if
this is the way men were
going to behave, then
perhaps they should not be
allowed in the bar.
The unscheduled
barnight was held after IC
students had been turned
away from the Britannia,
the intended venue for the
Drink-a-pub-dry evening.
The pub was closed down
at about 9.30pm, when the
students began singing.
FELIX has cropped the
pictures so as to preserve
the modesty of the
gentlemen concerned. The
complete photgraphs will
be published next week,
however, unless each of the
self-publicists make a
donation of £10 to Rag.
Beware boys; the FELIX
Sex Editor has described
the evidence as
'unimpressive'.
Mines Sling
More Shit
RSMU won the battle for
the Morphy oar on
Wednesday. The oar itself
came off second best,
however, and had a blade
broken in the struggle.
Guilds later gained revenge
by winning the C C U boat
race.
The Morphy Day
reconciliation barnight was
disappointing. During the
evening Union President
Carl Burgess disappeared,
taking with him the keys to
the Upper Lounge, where
two barrels of beer were
stored ready for when the
bar closed. Mr Burgess also
had the clues to the
'Idiosyncratic Event', which
was to take the form of a
treasure hunt. As a result,
when the Upper Lounge
was finally opened, the
beer had to be given away
free.
SCAB Sings
The Blues
S C A B Nite was a major
success, even though it
was closed down early.
Pictured above are one of
the bands who appeared at
the event
Carl In
The Drink
ICU President, Carl
Burgess, was soaked on
Tuesday evening while
using the Sherfield toilets
according close aides of
his. The Phantom Soaker
wrote to FELIX two weeks
ago stating that he would
strike five times on
Tuesday 19 November.
Sherfield Security told
FELIX yesterday they had
no knowledge of any
attacks this week.
Bondage
Around £250 was raised for
Rag by Monday's 'Slave
Auction'. Twenty students
volunteered to act as slaves
for one day and were 'sold'
to the highest bidder. Rag
Chairman John Ingham
said that the auction was a
great success, especially as
it was the first time the
event had been held.
Disappointing
There was a disappointing
turnout for the RCS Street
Collection on Saturday.
Only an estimated 30
students took part, and a
second street collection is
being organised for this
Saturaay. Rag Chairman
John Ingham said that he
was disappointed with the
publicity for the event.
Friday's 'Exec Torture'
was cancelled owing to
lack of support.
Last Friday's Rag and Drag Disco was a great success.
Putting on the style (above) are IC Union's favourite
socialites, (John Ingham and Kathy Tait).
