prose..etc, etc, etc. Anyway
I think you get our point.
In the hope of a more
exciting FELIX.
Yours,
Mike Bishop, Sarah
Hodgson, Phil Sparks, and
probably three-quarters of
the College.
PS We would write you
articles on the above
mentioned and other
equally interesting topics.
However at the present
time we have little
confidence in their eventual
appearance in our
wonderful paper. We await
your assurances with eager
anticipation.
Dear Students,
Hi students! This is an
important notice! It could
change your life! Then
again it may not! Now,
think carefully students! I'm
going to ask you some
questions!
Are you: Fed up with
boring old FELIX? Fed up
with trying to comprehend
the incomprehensible 'Arts'
section?
Fed up with the silly
sideways front page? Fed
up with reading reviews
cribbed from Time Out?
Fed up with nauseaous,
pointless 'Sex Specials?
Fed up with tiresome,
tedious indulgent QT
articles? Fed up with that
swotty bastard who's
always sitting in the front in
lectures.
Fed up, aw sodit all, fed
up with life itself?
Well! What you need,
what you really need, is a
great night out! At the
Guilds Carnival of course!
It's Tonight! It's Fun! And
it's Free!!!
Well actually it's £4.50 but
it'll only be £4.00 if you
really hurry! Do come!

Dear Sir,
I am writing with regard to
a piece of erroneous
reporting in your esteemed
publication.
It concerns the College
mascot, Boanerges. It is
correct to refer to Bo as
'he', his sex being
determined many moons
ago, and whilst I am quite
happy to accept that this
could have been a spelling
mistake on your part (vis
writing 'her' in your article)
the other information, or
rather misinformation, that
4 hours is the usual time is
well in error. This is in fact
an incredibly fast time, so
fast in-fact that we lost half
an hour at one point
waiting for the tender car
to catch up.
All of the above could
have been easily confirmed
by any Guilds hack, so you
really have no excuse for
getting it wrong.
Pedantically yours,
Ed Ashford, Bo Driver.
PS Get it wrong again and
we'll send the boys round.
Bookshop Reply
Dear Editor,
Regarding the councils
worries about the
Bookshop. We do not have
an overdraft. We have an
overdraft facility if it is
needed. Any union official
or student can come to see
me at anytime to discuss
any problem regarding the
Bookshop, after all it is
your Bookshop. If they did
they would have up to date
information.
With regard to our stock
levels, lecturers are asked
to let me have their
recommendations in June
for the coming Academic
year. From the information
received I order a
percentage of books
according to the number of
students taking into
account previous sales
patterns. They should also
let me know when the
books will be required.
Unfortunately some put
October when they may not
be needed until January as
happened last year, thereby
seriously affecting our our
cash flow. If we do not
stock all recommended
books people complain, if
we do and they haven't
sold in the first month of
term it still worries people
including me.
Since I have been here I
have insisted that the
Bookshop committee meets
monthly so I can keep the
students representatives of
each of the unions up to
date with the latest
developments.
Yours Faithfully

Dear FELIX,
Following our recent visits
to ULU it has been
demonstrated to us how
bad life at IC really is. Why
is it that the only thing IC
is famous for its
DRUNKEN, BORING MALE
SCIENTISTS, who only lift
their head out of a text
book to attend union bar
nights. FELIX, as the main
(only?) source of
information to IC students
must be to blame for
portraying this image of
our College, with four front
page 'LEADERS' out of six
about bar problems. Do
you honestly believe this is
the most important thing in
students minds? Or is it
simply a fact that nothing
of greater interest happens
at our College.
This image of IC has
been typified in last weeks
LONDON STUDENT where
it comments about the
recent Charity Rag Beer
festival at IC on Wednesday
13 November;
'The thought of all those
Physicists staggering
around drunk is enough to
make me sick before they
are. This is one for laying
down and avoiding'.
Although we are one of
the largest colleges in
London University, and one
of the most respected by
industry, we seem to
command a very low
respect from ULU receiving
little attention in their
student magazine. Is this
the fault of ULU
deliberately ingoring IC?
Or is it the fault of IC
isolating itself from the rest
of the university? We think
it is the latter. We do feel
isolated because we are not
affiliated to the NUS and
when was the last time we
had an opportunity to vote
on this position? Certainly
not since we have been at
College.
We realise that our
situation in South
Kensington doesn't help,
but many other College
not in close proximity to
ULU manage to be more
involved in the Union. How
many IC students have ever
been to ULU, or even
known where it is—we
think not many.
Very rarely, maybe for
the mentioned reasons, do
students come to IC,
whereas our students must
go elsewhere for our
enjoyment. The amount of
IC students, at Q E C (KQC)
on Friday night illustrates
this. We think IC, despite
its disadvantage has
something to offer London
students. People who have
been elected to responsible
positions should be trying
harder to encourage
integration between
London students rather
than the integration of IC
males in the union bar. You
never know, it may be
found that there is life
outside IC.
