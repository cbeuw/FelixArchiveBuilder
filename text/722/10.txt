ICMAC
The Corvette turned off
into the Car Park, and
came to a halt. The door
opened; Templeman Peck
got out and looked at the
end of the runway. He
glanced at his watch; they
should be here soon.
Meanwhile, Murdoch
adjusted the needle valve
as the engine fired. After
earlier problems with the
battery and transmitter, his
'plane was ready to fly. He
pushed the throttle
forwards and, as the 'plane
picked up speed, eased
back on the joystick. The
'plane was climbing rapidly
when suddenly, the
controls went haywire.
Murdoch shouted
'Damn—Decker has
jammed our frequency' as
he fought with the controls
The pitching of the 'plane
awoke BA—'What you
doing—fool!' he demanded.
The 'plane hit the
ground, exploding in a
huge fireball as the fuel
tank ruptured, flooding the
fuselage with 16% nitro. As
the fire raged, Murdoch
and BA crawled out of the
wreckage, and dusted
themselves down.
BA paced around the
dark empty cellar. 'Curse
Decker' he thought as he
looked in the empty oil
drums. Quite by chance he
stumbled on the old
welding gear, a Piped, 40
sheets of wood and a tube
of cyano-acrylate. Twenty
minutes later, the rebuilt
ICMAC trainer rolled out of
the cellar, ready to fly this
weekend.
Hannibal Smith took a
puff of his cigar and smiled
to himself. 'I love it when a
'plane gets together.
IC Human
Fruit Machine
This Saturday Covent
Garden will witness the
Rag Event of the Century.
Appearing at the request of
Rag Chairman John
Ingham, and giving its first
and last performance will
be the Imperial College
Human Fruit Machine.
This intrepid band of
virile young Freshers,
consisting of Garry 'The
System' Monaghan, Mark
The Arm' Mascal, Steve
'Mango' Molineaux, Peter
'Kiwi Fruit', White and Chris
'Passion Fruit' Eardley, will
give their all in an
unprecidented step to raise
lots of money for Rag.
Come along to give them
some support, help them,
or even to laugh at them.
'Mango' Molineaux is
quoted as saying, 'I feel my
whole life has been a
prelude to this day', while
'Passion fruit' Eardley
quipped, 'It should be an
orgasmically exciting
experience'. Garry 'The
System' Monaguan, a long
term patient in Broadmoor,
was unavailable for
comment.
IC Orchestra
Look! You've seen the
world-famous Trombone
Trio give their legendary
performance at SCAB
Night; now see the whole
of IC Orchestra in this
term's concert. The
programme includes
Vaughan-Williams 'The
Lark Ascending', with
violinist David Juritz, hot
from the English Chamber
Orchestra, as soloist. If
you've never heard this
enchanting work, now's
your chance . Should this
prove too pastoral for you,
don't worry; Rachmaninov's
ravishing second symphony
will be a suitable contrast.
All this for £1 (students), in
the Great Hall at 8.00pm
Friday November 29
(Tickets for ICSO
members, Haldane Library
or at the door). See you
there.
Wellsoc
The HG Wells Society ends
the term with two special
talks. On Tuesday 26
November we have the four
times world karate
champion, Geoff
Thompson, speaking on 'In
Pursuit of Excellence'.
This is followed on 2nd
December with Jim Naught
of the Guardian taking on
irreverant look at the House
of Commons: 'The Humour
of Polities'.
In addition to all this we
have the famous
Wellsoc/lndsoc Christmas
party near the end of term.
Stay tuned for further
details.
QT Soc
After the roaring success of
the Brown Paper Bag
Brothers, comes Cabaret 2
(just when you thought it
was safe to go back into
Huxley). This one features
Mark Steel, a talented
comedian slightly more
orthodox than the lads with
the brown paper fetish.
Please come along and
support this event—it's got
to be good value—Free to
members, £1 (Inc
Membership) to others.
That's this Tuesday at 1pm
in Huxley 145 (it will be
sign posted from the
walkway and from the main
entrance).
Ap Tech
Those of you who haven't
yet joined Ap Tech Soc had
better get a move
on—otherwise you'll be
missing out on the most
toothsome event of the
year, the Winter Solstice
Lunch (or Christmas
Dinner if that's more your
scene). This will be held on
Thursday November 28th at
12.40pm in the Lounge
(ground floor, Union
Building). Food will be
healthy, tasty and solar-
powered—not your average
cheese and wine! There
might even be a bit of good
background blues music.
This event is free to
members, but you will be
able to join at the door
(£1).
By way of a contrast,
good luck to everyone
who's going hungry on
Monday and Tuesday.
If you're not actually
fasting, try and support
those who are—the money
you give will be going to real,
appropriate third world
projects.
See you on the 28th!
Ten Tors
Every year the RCS Ten
Tors Club sends a team
into the Ten Tors club
expedition on Dartmoor.
The expedition consists of
navigating between ten of
Dartmoor's Tors covering a
distance of up to 55 miles
over pathless moor. It is
described by the Army,
who organise the event, as
a weekend of challenging
adventure demanding
careful planning, skillful
navigation, endurance and
team work.
Because of the severity
of the event, after
Christmas we start training
by running around Hyde
Park, climbing up all 12
floors of the Physics
building, doing presups
next ot the Serpentine etc.
If you are still interested
or just want to find out a
little more about the event,
then we are having a
meeting above Southside
Bar on Tuesday 3rd Dec at
12.30, mainly just to find
the level of interest. If you
can't make the meeting
then leave a note in one of
the letter racks D Gott
Maths 2 or A Fazakerly
Physics 2 and we will
inform you of the next
meeting.
If there is enough
interest, especially from the
ladies, then we will try and
enter a Mens team and a
ladies/mixed team. So if
you are only even slightly
interested, come along to
the meeting, we look
forward to seeing you.
SF Soc
Rumour has it that while
Isaac Newton was sitting
under the tree thinking
about the rising price of
fruit, he was also heard to
comment on the fact that
the video had not been
invented, and indeed, that
he wrote about the video in
'The Principia', but it lost a
lot in translation.
ICSF soc, however are
pleased to announce that
the video has been
invented (indeed we have
been aware of this fact for
several days now) and will
be celebrating in true style
with a video evening, to be
held on the 29 of November
in the Union building.
Looking further into the
future (as SF Soc are wont
to do), a treat for all 'Beam
Me up, Scotty' Fans, Star
Trek 2—the Wrath of Kahn,
to be shown on Thursday
the 5 December.
So that true Trekkies can
see the episode, the film
will be shown slightly later
than normal. Immediately
following the film, we shall
by going to the One Tun,
Londons biggest Science
fiction meeting. Anyone
who wants to come along
is welcome.
Details of these and other
forthcoming events, access
to SF Socs library and a
little known outline to an
unwritten Larry Niven
Novel are availabe at the
regular Thursday lunchtime
meetings in the Green
Committee room in the
Union building.
FELIX Friday 22 November 11
