Investigating
Accountancy
So, the square-jaw behind the desk looks me straight
between the eyes. "Tell me, Mr Marlowe" he snarls, "you
look the type of guv who investigates the broads more often
than the books. What brings you to K M G Thomson
McLintock?"
"Curiosity, I guess," I told him "not to mention career
prospects with the best bunch of pros in town!"
He laid back in his chair and smiled. "Let's talk chartered
accountancy", he said.
I figured I was in the right place.

Unlikely as it may seem, a chartered
accountant and a detective have more in
common than you might have thought. The
ability to follow leads, sift through evidence and
examine facts are just some of the skills
necessary to both professions. If you are con-
sidering a career in chartered accountancy, take
a look at the credentials of KMG Thomson
McLintock-we think you'll agree, it's an open
and shut case.

gressive organisation with over 140 partners

graduate valuable experience in, and a
