Biology Want More
Of Union Building
Up to half the Union Building
will be converted to academic
use if the Biology Department's
plans go ahead. In addition to
the Bot/Zoo Common Room
and the Lounge, the department
has plans to convert other
rooms on the ground and first
floors of the Union into labs
and lecture theatres.
The need for extra space for
Biology has arisen from the
decision to sell the Ashurst
Lodge buildings at Silwood
Park. Silwood is the College's
field station near Ascot, where a
large part of the Biology
department is based. At present
research is carried out there on
two main sites, Silwood Main
House and Ashurst Lodge,
which are nearly half a mile
apart. The sale of Ashurst
would necessitate the re-
housing of research groups
based there either in South
Kensington or in new buildings
near Silwood Main House. It is
to house those to be moved to
South Kensington that the
department wants to take over
parts of the Union Building.
Professor Anderson, Head of
the Biology Department, is
believed to want the sale to go
ahead so that as large a part as
possible of the department can
be moved to South Kensington.
Only research which needs the
special facilities of Silwood
would then remain at the field
station. Staff based at Ashurst
Lodge have been asked to
consider whether they need to
remain at Silwood or can be
moved into London.
The move from Silwood to
South Kensington would not
take place quickly. After being
sold, most, of Ashurst Lodge
would be leased back from the
new owners to accommodate
College staff until new labs
were found for them. Thus the
take-over of the Union Building
might not be presented as a
single package, but could be
achieved piecemeal over several
years as a phased withdrawl
from Ashurst Lodge takes place.
If the Lounge and Bot/Zoo are
atken next year, they could be
followed by the UDH and SCR
in subsequent years.
The plans are of course
dependant on finding a buyer
for Ashurst Lodge. There is only
one potential buyer at present,
believed to be the
Commonwealth Institute for
Biological Control (CIBC), a
commercial research institute
who already have some staff
based at Silwood in the Main
House. They are interested in
acquiring more space for future
expansion and are considering
Ashurst Lodge as well as
possibilities on other sites. A
decision is expected from the
CIBC next month. However,
planning permission has already
been obtained for new buildings
near Silwood Main House, some
of which will form the
Technology Transfer Centre
(based on the 'Science Park'
idea) but some of which are
designed to re-house research
at present carried out in Ashurst
Lodge. Building is expected to
commence in March or April
next year.
The Guilds hit squad gave Stirling Moss an unexpected drive
around South Kensington on Tuesday. In a daring raid
masterminded by Field Marshall Roger Preece, the motor ace of
the early 60's was bundled into Bo by two heavies, one brandishing
a pop gun, and whisked away at a daring speed. Guilds henchmen
were then despatched to the lecture theatre where Mr Moss was
due to give a talk and demanded vast amounts of money for his
prompt return. The victim eventually arrived ten minutes later and
was said to be cold but none the worse for his ordeal.
NUS
Kop It
Liverpool University Guild
Council have decided by 38
votes to 34 to withhold half their
NUS affiliation fee, a sum of
£15,000. At an earlier Union
General Meeting a motion to
disaffiliate from NUS had been
defeated. The motion passed at
the Guilds Council meeting
claimed that NUS was 'an agent
of the Labour party' and
expressed dissatisfaction with
'extravagent' spending, a profit
of £1/4 million and reserves of
£1 million.
Deputy President Andy
Wilkinson said they had
submitted a motion on reform
for the NUS Conference, which
NUS first claimed not to have
received. Later NUS said they
had received the motion, but
that it had not been accepted.
He went on to say that
Liverpool University Students'
Union pays four times the
national average in affiliation
fees. The Union is awaiting a
reply from NUS which may have
been delayed as there is a
postal strike on at the moment.
The NUS Press Officer
commented that it was up to
Liverpool Students Union 'to
sort themselves out' and that
there had been a political
faction within the Guilds
Council who were effectively
overruling the decision made at
the UGM not to disaffiliate. So
far no decision has been taken
regarding the non-payment of
half the affiliation fees, or
whether the matter will be
discussed at next month's NUS
Conference.
ICU President Carl Burgess
claimed that it is being
speculated that Liverpool
Students Union are trying to get
themselves expelled from NUS
despite the U G M vote to remain
affiliated.
Sweeney
Strikes
Scab Nite and the Lounge
Beach Party were closed down
by security at midnight on
Saturday. This occured after the
Union Bar gents lavatories had
been vandalised by a Cardiff
Miners sports team, who had
been playing RSMU. Security
guard, Terry Sweeney, said he
thought there was something
odd going on, when he saw
loads of people walking past his
office with pieces of copper
piping.
