An excellent opportunity
to join the North Sea Oil
and Gas Industry
Total Oil Marine has a vacancy for a bright engineering graduate (any specialism) to assist
in the development of the Alwyn South field in the North Sea.
You will assist the Alwyn Development Manager in:
- Preparing, following up and discussing with the Department of
Energy the draft Annex Bs (detailed presentation documents) of
the developments underway—Alwyn south-west and Alwyn
south-east.
- Assisting in and following up the gas sales negotiations. This
involves supplying the gas negotiators with technical data and
economic evaluations and providing the answers to any questions
arising from them.
You will be looking for a generalist role where you can use your technical knowledge
but not in a purely "hands on" role. You will be able to amass information quickly, think
clearly and be skilled at verbal and written communication.
It is envisaged this position will form the first stage of your career within the company
and will provide an excellent basis on which to build, providing you with the opportunity
to liaise with many levels of management in both the commercial and technical spheres.
It is appreciated that final examinations are imminent—in the first instance candidates should
establish contact with us to inform us of their interest in the position and applications can
then be made when convenient by forwarding your CV or an SAF to:
