Insanity
I am starting to doubt my own sanity. I cannot
understand why I continue to produce FELIX when I
receive crack-pot letters from 'wimmin' like
Samanatha Free and Kay Leedham-Green (see Letters
'IC's female eunuchs.' From an issue which covered
prostitution and politics, they managed to take
offence to a book review. I have a strong suspicion
that the authors spent their knitting break in an intense
debate on the review and the questions of sexual
stereotyping it raised (man).
The letter reminded me of the NALGO (National
Association of Local Government Officers) reaction
to Ben Turner's 'Great Tits' posters. The NALGO
'Chair' (apparently there is still gainful employment
available to items of furniture) complained about the
sexist nature of this and other student union material.
I hear that she is the kind of perkin who objects to
the word 'manhole' on the basis that it implies a male
domination of our society. Sadly Ms Footstool used
the word 'manage,' during her missive, which should
have read 'perkinage'. (Person is sexist since it implies
a male kin.) The sort of extremism which this kind of
perkin generates is truly crackpot. All I can add is,
huge bottoms and boobs to you too, Ms Footstool!
St Mary's
On a more serious note, I should like to congratulate
Simon Smith for winning his election for President of
St Mary's Student Union. This year's President,
Rhydian Hapgood, has done an excellent job,
smoothing the rough waters stirred up last year by
Nigel Baker and his 'diplomacy.'
Last night I went 'across the park' to chat to a few
people from Mary's. It was interesting to see how
students at Mary's view IC. One of the largest
obstacles to any interaction between the South
Kensington and Paddington sites seems to be a
general distrust. I can understand the fears of students
at Mary's. Many of them believe that IC Union wants
to swallow up their clubs and their finances. St Mary's
has a strong community where everybody knows one
another and everybody is involved in some sort of
extra-curricula activity. If IC Union were to incorporate
the clubs at Mary's into its own, a great deal of this
spirit would be lost. Having seen the 60% + turnout
for their elections, compared to the pathetic 15-20%
IC usually manages, I can see why they are so
concerned. Do students at St Mary's really want that
sort of apathy to spread across the park? St Mary's
student union needs financial independence.
Whatever arrangement emerges from talks next year,
this will have to be a key point. Once this issue is
settled, I believe the resulting trust between the two
communities will lead to better connections.
Competition
I have decided to award a prize of £5 to the first
person who can produce a photograph of that nice
man from estates, lb Hagan.. when he is smiling. Mr
Hagan and members of his family are not eligible to
enter.
