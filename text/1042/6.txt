Fe//x explores the world of (aimg use; a world
which we all Inhabit whether we know it or not.
and the
world
Let's be honest. I'm addicted, and so are
you. To what? Take your pick: alcohol, cig-
arettes, chocolate, caffeine, ecstasy...
Ecstasy? Surely its a little odd to include
it in such a list? Perhaps not. It seems
that many young people regard popping
an E as being about as illegal as swiping
the odd traffic cone.
Witness Leah Bett's untimely death
last week. She was a bright, sensible
young girl with everything going for her.
Her parents - an ex-police officer and a j
nurse - had been responsible in her i
upbringing and warned her of the dangers
of taking drugs. Yet in the early hours of
Sunday last week, Leah collapsed an later
died after taking a pill of unadulterated
Ecstasy.
Why did she do it? The answer is sim-
ple. Drugs are fun. Drugs make you feel
good. This is what today's young people
believe, inspired by such sayings as, "If you
can remember the 60s then you weren't
there". The 'good times' ethic of the previ-
ous generation has been translated into the
drug and rave scene of today.
The media's response to Leah's death
was predictable; "It Could Be Your Child"
screamed the headlines. Ministers will no
doubt be under pressure to 'get tough' on
drugs and increase prison sentences for drug
offences.
But for the last 20 years this has been
happening and the "war against drugs" is
V^being lost. What is needed is a new
approach, yet the Labour MP Clare Short
was universally condemned for merely sug-
gesting that there should be public debate
on legalising certain drugs.
It was recently estimated that ecsta- >
sy kills 50 people a year in Britain. This is
largely due to the environment in which its
taken - hot and frantic night-clubs. The
government has responded by releasing a
white paper that proposes to force such
venues to provide free fresh cold
water.
Alcohol kills hundreds and is responsi-
ble for over half the rapes and murders
committed each year, but John Major
isn't rushing to crack down on pubs and
off-licenses. This is because it's (mis-
takenly) believed that alcohol can be
used responsibly and isn't a significant
danger to one's health.
Why doesn't the government admit
that it can't stop people taking drugs (of
both the legal and illegal kind)? It should
instead concentrate its effort on making it
safer for drug users. If this means legalising
some drugs, then that's for the best.
Legalisation may also reduce the crime
associated with drugs - The Economist has
been in favour of decriminalisation since
1993, along with a group of senior police
officers and judges who suggested it was
time to "think the unthinkable."
It is society as a whole, not just the gov-
ernment, needs to address the issue of drug
use in a mature and honest manner. Whilst
the use of drugs should not be encouraged,
the responsible use of drugs should be
emphasised. Until this happens, more
young people will die for simply trying to
having a good time.
