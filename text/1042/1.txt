Students Snatch
Intruder in Weeks
BY MARK BRIDGE
A man alleged to have been
responsible for a series of bur-
glaries in student halls was taken
into custody at Belgravia Police
Station on Tuesday night.
The man was apprehended
in Weeks Hall after he entered a
woman's room claiming he was
looking for a toilet. A group of
students followed the intruder
and alerted College Security,
detaining the man until Police
arrived.
The description of the man
caught at Weeks apparently fits
that of a 6'3" Afro-Caribbean
man who has been spotted wan-
dering around Evelyn Gardens
on many occasions. He typically
tried to gain entry from the back
of the building and proceeded to
try students' doors for entry. A
large number of items were
reported missing during this
period. Several residents report-
ed incidents in which the man
would ask to borrow a pen, and
then leave.
No one had actually chal-
lenged anyone at Evelyn Gardens
until Tuesday night, when a man
entered a room and encountered
two residents who immediately
called security. The man ran off.
One of the two residents, in
a ground floor room, said his sus-
picions were aroused when he
saw a man looking in through
their window earlier that
evening. A man said to fit the
description of this intruder was
apprehended later that night at
Weeks. The two Evelyn Gardens
residents were called to see if
they could identify the man.
The police could only com-
ment that enquiries were contin-
uing at Belgravia. However, it is
believed that the man could be a
part of a group of three people
who have been targeting IC this
year.
Security sources say there
has been a general increase in
petty crime reports from resi-
dents of Imperial halls. In one
incident a laptop computer was
found discarded in a bathroom
when the thief was scared off.

E's With Ease?
BY ALEX FEAKES A N D BEN
WILKINS
IC Students spoke about the
ease of obtaining drugs on cam-
pus when they were interviewed
on national radio last week.
Radio 4's PM program last
Thursday was investigating the
rave and dance culture amongst
today's youth, with special refer-
ence to the drug Ecstasy, known
as 'E', and the extent of its use
amongst students in London..
The second year students
considered getting ecstasy
tablets to be fairly easy at
Imperial, there being an exten-
sive drug sub-culture here,
where drugs are readily obtain-
able. Research by Felix has
revealed that there is a big mar-
ket for Ecstasy at IC, London
colleges' students tending to be
more into the 'drug scene' than
other universities.
The biggest consumers of E
tend to be young people living in
