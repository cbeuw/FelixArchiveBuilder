Tribunal Dubbed a "Witch-Hunt"
BY J O N A T H A N TROUT
A Linstead re-app has been
expelled from the hall following
drunken behaviour during the
now infamous Halloween party.
The residents' tribunal of
Andrew Deeley took place in the
Chemistry building last Friday
morning.
Before the tribunal it was
widely expected that Mr Deeley
would escape with a £100 fine,
but the weight of the charges
brought against him, ranging
from indecent exposure to
threatening the life of a sub-war-
den and blackmail, left no one
present in much doubt as to the
outcome.
After 35 minutes of deliber-
ation, the tribunal decided that
Mr Deeley's tenure at Linstead
Hall should be terminated,
and his room vacated within
seven days. In addition, he has
been banned from all communal
areas of Linstead.
However, the most unex-
pected proceedings of the tri-
bunal dealt with the accusations
against Linstead Bar Chair Nick
Hudson. In an attempt to por-
tray Deeley's diminished respon-
sibility, Adam Torry, a friend of
Mr Deeley, inadvertently asked
Mr Hudson a leading question
regarding licensing laws, specifi-
cally whether Mr Hudson had
served Mr Deeley a "Green
Lizard", an extremely alcoholic
cocktail.
It transpired that he had
indeed served a close friend of
Deeley, knowing that the drink
was for him. In his defence, Mr
Hudson said that he had only
just arrived at the bar, and did
not know that Mr Deeley was
already drunk. An independent
observer noted that anyone in
the bar could have served Mr
Deeley that night, as he was cel-
ebrating his birthday. This
included a sub-warden, who was
allegedly seen behind the bar
serving people whilst drunk him-
self.
The tribunal ruled that in
light of this new information
Linstead Bar was to be closed
again; then in a bizarre turn of
events it was inexplicably
reopened in time for that night's
normal 7pm start.
Nick Hudson was stripped
of his bar duties by Earl
Lancaster that afternoon, and
only found out the following day
that his case would not be taken
before a tribunal. His punish-
ment would be decided by Dr
Lancaster, and would undoubt-
The enduring nature of the
Southside Halls of residence are
illustrated by the remarkable
coincidence of one student
being allocated the same room
in hall as his father had occu-
pied thirty years ago.
The top photograph, taken
in 1967, shows the student's
mother in the Tizard room a few
years after the hall was built.
This September, when dropping
her son off at Imperial College
to start his four year Chem Eng
degree, his parents took the bot-
tom photo. However, the chair
the student's mother is sitting in
the same in both photos, with
only the covering having
changed.
The 'Twilight Zone' experi-
ence, as one of the re-apps
called it, was emphasised by the
fact that the only alterations to
the room over the years had
been the addition of a carpet, a
new bed and new curtains.
Southside Halls were origi-
nally built in the sixties as a
temporary measure to house the
growing numbers of students at
IC. They were only meant to
last for twenty years, but are
now listed.
edly be less harsh than the tri-
bunal.
Fortunately, this did not
include being thrown out of hall,
but his penalty was as severe as it
could be without his permanent
eviction. He was fined £100 and
banned from the buying, selling
or consumption of alcohol in all
areas of Linstead Hall. Mr
Hudson was "shocked at the
College's reaction", but some
have remarked that, unlike Mr
Deeley, his good relationship
with the warden saved him from
a worse fate.
The doctor was reluctant to
comment on last week's events,
saying that such matters are not
for public discourse. Others pre-
sent were not so happy with the
result, one labelling it as a
'witch-hunt' and another as an
unfair 'kangaroo court'.
Bikes for BMS
BY DIPAK G H O S H
Temporary bike sheds are to be
built during the construction of
the Basic Medical Science build-
ing, but plans for permanent bike
sheds for the BMS students have
yet to be finalised.
At present, the bike sheds
are scattered around the college,
but the bike shed for the BMS
will be the result of "an integrat-
ed approach" according to
College Facilities manager
Valerie Straw, who is responsi-
ble for buildings planning at IC.
Mm
Furthermore, car-parks are to be
re-located to another site. Mrs
Straw also said that this tempo-
rary bike shed will be safe for
students during the construc-
tion.
Students concerned for the
safety of their bikes may want to
have them coded for free next
week in the Sherfield anteroom,
between 10am and 4pm. PC
Clive Coleman will be on hand
to discuss any aspects of crime
prevention around college.
