London taking advantage of the
ready supply in the southeast.
Ecstasy mainly comes into the
country from Holland and
Belgium but there are also many
factories in this country, though
they tend to be smaller and less
organised.
Felix spoke to a dealer, Mr
Wright, who has supplied
Imperial students with E in the
past. He explained that some of
the basis for IC's Ecstasy culture
lay in the popularity of E a few
years ago amongst those who
went to raves. Since about 1992,
when rave was at its height, he
has seen a decrease in demand
and price. This more or less
agrees with the figures that the
Police have published in the
past.
When asked how much
money he made peddling his
wares around college, Mr Wright
declined to reveal exact figures.
He did say that if you buy Es in
the 1000s, you can expect to pay
about £5 each, and then sell
them on for £15 individually.
"The largest dealers buy from
the factories in units of 10-
20,000 pills."
Mr Wright said he had
become more wary of the effects
of the drug following the tragic
death of Leah Betts and the
ensuing public debate. Leah took
her first E on her eighteenth

Chris Smith, Labour MP for
Islington South and Finsbury and
Shadow Cabinet spokesman on
Social Services, was a guest of
IC's Labour Society on
Wedneday. Making up for the
delay getting to IC, Mr Smith
plunged straight into a discourse
about the opportunities for
Britain heralded by the
Information Revolution.
Citing some examples of
how the widespread use of mod-
ern technology and computers
had increased knowledge and
improved learning, the MP said
he felt that it would be a wasted
birthday and subsequently col-
lapsed into a coma from which
she did not recover.
Some users he knew had
experienced problems when
using E; one person had had fits
and spasms after taking the drug,
and another had suffered from
liver problems. He was keen to
emphasise that having reliable
contacts helps to ensure that the
Es you buy are pure or safe, but
the only way you can be fairly
certain is to try one, or at least to
know someone who has taken
one.
Faced with the decline in
the use of E, Mr Wright said that
cocaine is definitely becoming
more popular, more readily
available and less expensive.
"Even poor students are doing
coke these days," he said.
"People tend to move on from E
to cocaine, and I would say most
of the people who were into
Ecstasy in 1991 are now doing
coke."
College authorities have in
the past expressed concern over
the level of drug use at IC, espe-
cially the use of cannabis. The E
threat is one that has largely gone
unreported so far, with few if
any incidents being Ecstasy-
related. A rise in cocaine use
could worry the College, as the
effects on its users are greater
and more long lasting than those
of Ecstasy and cannabis.
chance if nothing were done to
harness and exploit Britain's
advantages in this field. He par-
ticularly emphasised the role of
the telecommunications giant BT
in creating the country-wide net-
work of cabling required to
achieve the goal of allowing
everyone access to the internet.
After his speech, Mr Smith
opened the floor to questions,
with subjects ranging from pay-
ment for the internet terminals
to the decision-making process
of the Labour Party.
Commenting on his recent move
from the Heritage portfolio, he
said it was a shame that he had-

that the problem been solved.
He went on to state the Party's
line on the privatisation of BR,
saying that Labour are adamant
that the scheme will fail, and it is
only a matter of time before any
partial privatisation is reversed.
