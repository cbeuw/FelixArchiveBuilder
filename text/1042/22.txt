BEIT HALL
SUB-WARDEN REQUIRED
A vacancy exists for the post of Sub-Warden in Beit Hall.
We are seeking to appoint a suitable individual to this post
from the start of February 1996. The duties include; pastoral
care of students, organisation of social events and involve-
ment in the day to day running of the Hall. The successful
candidate is expected to be highly motivated to carry out
these type of activities. The ability to take responsibility
whilst maintaining friendly relations with students is essen-
tial. Although the post is open to any member of College a
post-graduate student or post-doctoral researcher with a
minimum of 18 months remaining in the College is pre-
ferred. The accommodation available with this post is suit-
able for a couple.
Applications comprising a covering letter, a curriculum vitae
and two letters of reference should be sent to Dr Jon
Marangos, L A S P 2, Physics (47857 (Work) or 49453 (Flat)).
The closing date for applications is the 15th December 1995
(although under certain circumstances later applications may
be considered).
Editor,
Nooman Haque raised some
very important points in his arti-
cle last week. The Prime
Minister, the new Foreign
Secretary and the Conservative
Party are completely opposed to
the dated Utopian fantasy of
Eurofederalism. It is vital that
Malcolm Rifkind gets unequivo-
cal support from the Commons
and the country for his defence
of our sovereignty at the coming
Intergovernmental Conference
(IGC). His position will be
undermined if the Labour Party
opportunistically accuses the
Government of "being isolation-
ist" etc when the disagreements
start...
We will challenge Labour to
denounce the manifesto when
we debate Europe, a crucial issue
at the next election, with them
on Thursday November 30th at
12.30 pm in the Brown
Committee Room. Perhaps they
will also be able to explain why
the French and German govern-
ments are trying to postpone the
IGC until after a possible Labour
victory in order to strengthen
their position.

Editor,
Many students have been
incensed by the dreadful account
of the John Gummer meeting in
Felix...
...If Felix continue to pro-
duce such grot then we shall rec-
ommend that only a photograph
of the Minister talking should be
incorporated into the issue. If
this is too much trouble it may
be a good idea for you not to
bother. Readers will, of course,
be able to read a factual account
on our W W W pages. The biased
element is deliberately kept to a
minimum.
Regards,
Geoff Boon
Consoc Vice Chairman
Dear Felix,
Congrattilations on your
report about John Glimmer's
visit! I can tell whoever wrote it
has a bright future in journalism,
tabloid journalism that is...
...In future could you please
report about our speakers accu-
rately.
Yours
Ian Davey
Consoc Secretary
Dear Ed,
After Michael Ludlam's
amusing article about the lack of
women at Imperial, I couldn't
resist bringing up yet another
point in this long running debate,
Michael asks 'where else can you
find so many men alone in one
place?' ...how about in industry?
Face it guys, 27% is an incredibly
high ratio compared to life in the
'real world', especially for those
who pursue a career in engineer-
ing... I spent my year out work-
ing for a major chemical compa-
ny where there were less than
2% women on site. Coming to
college, even to Mech Eng, was a
real change. Even the sciences at
school for a female are dominat-
ed by males. I never really
expected university to be any
different, although it appears
most of my male friends did.
It's time IC man stopped
bemoaning his fate and, to put it
bluntly, 'got a life'! How do you
expect to meet women (ever!) if
you spend your evenings either
working (yes, I meet the geeks)
or in the bar with the lads. There
as many female students as men
in London... Try visiting U L U or
join those clubs and societies
that have a male/female mix
and/or visit other colleges in
London. If you don't take the
initiative now, when do you
think all these women are going
to materialise in your life?
