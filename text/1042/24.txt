IC's Karate Boys
Sweep the Board
After several weeks of arduous
training and sparring practice,
four members of the Shotokan
Karate Club signed up for
the South East London
Championships. The day kicked
off with the Kata competition in
the morning, allowing IC's boys
to assess the competition and
begin the psyche up. Two contes-
tants from Imperial, Alexander
Bistis and Dmitri Tsapoulis were
entered into the junior grades
kumite (sparring) whilst Edson
Dos Santos and Thomas Hill
were fighting against brown and
black belts.
The tournament was run on
a "knockout" system, meaning
that if you lost a fight you were
out for the day. Each fight lasted

Please give me your results - Ed
about two minutes and first up
was Alex who had a comfortable
victory over his first round oppo-
nent. Tom then was thrown into
the fray, and managed to win
with a perfectly executed round-
house kick. Edson continued this
winning streak into the second
and third rounds whilst Tom, to
his lack of experience and gener-
al nice guy attitude lost to a sec-
ond dan black belt in the third.
Edson though was seeded to fight
this black belt in the final.
Before that however, "Hard
Man" Dmitiri and Alex "the keen
one" were to fight and beat all
the other competitors in their
category which meant an all IC
final. The fight itself was techni-
cally imperfect, with both stu-
dents receiving warnings
about leaving the ring, but
some good techniques
came into play before the
end, when Dmitri finally
triumphed, with Alex tak-
ing the silver.
Then came the big clash.
Edson walked up to the
ring as the crowd fell into
a respectful silence. The
two fighters bowed, then
fell into their fighting
stances. Blows were
exchanged, but it was
Edson who scored first,
with a well executed
backhand strike, underlin-
ing his more confident and
aggressive approach,
Going into his "Edson
shuffle" routine to con-
fuse his opponent, he was
declared winner after a
long drawn out bout.

UCL Men
As the teams lined up for the
start, Imperial realised them-
selves to be missing two runners.
Initial investigations showed
that Tom was distracted by a
'babe' (or a rhinoceros, depend-
ing on whose opinion you take),
whilst Jurgen was smitten with
who appeared to be Great Uncle
Bulgaria.
Missing the start though
would appear to be of little
importance as two thirds of the
IC team got lost. Obviously
Emily didn't as she is dead good
at map reading, and not a whing-
ing little girlie, honest.
Feeling somewhat embar-
rassed by the ease with which
they had defeated UCL, IC
offered them a chance to settle
the score: a competitive Quad
run. Despite Satomi's eagerness
the rest of the team lived up to
its lightweight reputation and,
amidst complaints of having
'insufficient equipment',
returned to their homework,
leaving IC's victorious runners to
celebrate in the Union.

Goldsmiths 3-0 ICWFC
The simple moral of this game
is: never, ever, ever wear fluores-
cent pink gloves if you intend to
handle the football in the box.
No Surprise
as Hockey
Team Lose
Once More
Fortunately for IC's hockey
team, Forest's 7-0 thrashing at
the weekend makes their 4-0
defeat at the hands of the
Zambeian National Metallurgists
Society (6th XI), (aka RHUL)
seem almost respectable.
Almost. I am sure that, had the
referee added another five min-
utes injury time, IC could have
even hit the ball.
There is an old adage that
it's the competing that counts,
not the winning. Sadly for IC, its
the coach ride home that counts,
as they are summarily unable to
compete.
After a poor start, IC's sec-
ond XI's already low numbers
were further depleted to nine by
G.Michael taking an early ambu-
lance ride to A&E.
After his remains had been
removed from the pitch a stir-
ring and relentless effort by IC
resulted in P.D.File leveling the
match at one all, earning the sec-
onds a draw which, of course,
should have been victory...
