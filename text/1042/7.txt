please!
At Imperial, 90% of the population drink
socially; 5% are teetotal; and 5% have a
drinking problem. Of the 90% of social
drinkers, many will at some time in their
lives fall into the category of problem
drinkers and will need to take steps to con-
trol their drinking.
A "drinking problem" can be defined in
several ways:
• Drinking in excess of the recommended
WEEKLY limits of 14 units for women and
21 units for men. (The difference is due to
differences in body weight and fat con-
tent).
• Having a dependence on alcohol so that
you can't get through the day without a
drink.
• When drinking habits interfere with your
work, family and relationships with friends.
As students most of us drink socially,
but do you realise how much you drink?
Remember 14 units a week is the same as 7
pints of lager. So girls, if you drink a couple
of glasses of wine with a meal on Monday
and two pints of lager after sport on
Wednesday, the safe amount to drink over
the weekend would be 4 pints or 8 glasses
of wine. It would be very easy to exceed
the limit if there was a party on Saturday.
Boys can only safely drink 1.5 pints a day '
- another target that is easy to exceed if you
don't count the empty glasses!
If you would like more information
about alcohol use pick up a leaflet from the
Advice Unit or your G.P.
If you would like help with a drinking
problem there are lots of support groups
available

Here are a few medical facts:
• Alcohol is a very addictive drug.
Excessive alcohol in the long term causes;
• Impotence & infertility (not a bad thing
with some people)
• Liver cirrhosis
i
j • Brain damage (how can you tell?)
I • Life threatening gastric bleeding
• Premature death (as opposed to dying
on time?)
j Excessive alcohol in the short term causes;
• Loss of bodily functions (except for your
mouth)
• Life threatening behaviour (such as call-
ing Tim Townend a poof)
• Painful vomiting (you feel better after-
wards though)
• Inhaling your own vomit (and other
nasty substances like nicotine)
• Respiratory depression, coma and then
death, (ooh, joy!)

Some simple methods can help us to cut
down the total amount we drink without
decreasing the fun we have with friends:
• Keep a drinking diary
• Knowing how much you drink and with
whom can help you cut out that pint or
glass of wine that wasn't really necessary.
• Choose a low-alcohol or non-alcoholic
drink sometimes.
• You don't need a drink to enjoy yourself.
• Pace your drinking throughout the
evening.
• Slow your drinking down.
• Buy half pints or interrupt alcohol with
non-alcoholic drinks
• If you are drunk stop drinking! Those
extra pints won't improve you enjoyment
of the evening.
• Choose when you are going to drink
•There are lots of other places to socialise
other than the bar
8. On a day trip to France you bring back:
a) a model of the Eiffel Tower
b) as much drink as you can carry
c) as much drink as the ferry can carry
9. You favourite watering hole is:
a) Linstead Bar
b) Union Bar or Southside Bar
c) I can never remember where I drink...
10. Sex on the beach is:
a) sandy and unhygenic
b) a good idea!
c) better with Jack Daniels and Malibu
Now check your answers for the verdict...
Mostly As:
You either don't drink at all or drink only in
small quantities. You'd rather be doing work
- after all, that's why you're at university.
Who wants to spend all their cash on booze
anyway? You are a typical Imperial Student.
Mostly B's:
You like the odd drink or two, but you know
where your limits are. But what did happen
at the Fresher's Frolik? You are a typical
Imperial student.
Mostly C's:
You eat your cornflakes covered with
Boddington's. Less than five pints a night is
for losers only. You like playing [insert sport
here] because they have such great drinking
games. Work? That's lifting the pint to your
mouth. You are a typical Imperial Student.
A, B and C for all questions:
You are beyond hope. You drink like a fish
and when you're not drinking, you're uncon-
scious. You are probably ICU Deputy
President for Clubs and Socs (any year).
