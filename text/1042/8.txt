Ecstasy has hit the headlines again. The
Sun said that the death of Leah Betts was a
tragedy and no-one deserved to lose a child
like that. I don't think anyone would dis-
agree with that, but the sub- wmm^
sequent deluge of moralistic jjr
knee-jerk reactions were
nothing more than brain-
washed propaganda written
by journalists who have prob-
ably never seen an E before,
let alone taken one.
So what is Ecstasy? In a
decent strength pure tablet
there should be 100-150mg
of MDMA (n-methyl 3, 4
methylenedioxyampheta-
mine); in reality there is sometimes
MDEA, MDA, speed, caffeine... you name
it. Ingesting such a tablet of MDMA
induces euphoria, empathy and greatly
increased tactile sensation. It is not physi-
cally addictive but prolonged regular use
does bring on a tolerance. This is because of
a depletion of seratonin levels in the brain,
which can leave you feeling depressed.
Taking a break of at least a month or two
before taking it again is advisable.
I don't think MDMA is psychological-
ly addictive as such, but the scene that goes
with it can be. The feeling you get with an
E, in a club with a thousand like-minded
souls is absolutely amazing, possibly the
best in the world. However, it can all seem
a bit fake afterwards and the next day you
are left feeling rather spaced out (partly
due to over-exercise). As Jarvis Cocker
puts it "I seem to have left an important
part of my brain somewhere, somewhere in
a field in Hampshire." Having said that, a
good night's sleep will sort you out and I
don't think it is a very dangerous drug, cer-
tainly less so than speed.
Why then is MDMA a class A drug ^
(the same as crack and heroin) and speed
in class B? Speed is physically and psycho-
logically addictive and can really mess you
up, but is considered by the government to
be less harmful than MDMA, which they
continually refuse to test to see how safe it
is. In 1977 MDA and all it's analogues were
made illegal. I can understand
why M D A was banned
because its pretty nasty stuff
with a low toxic dose, but
there was no real evidence to
outlaw MDMA in the first
place.
Michael Howard and his
cronies are keen to stamp out
Ecstasy, the scourge of
today's youth, but in actual
fact E is helping to keep crime
figures down. The more peo-
ple there are in clubs taking E and being
nice to each other, the fewer there are in
pubs starting fights.
Even though we approach the twenty-
first century the government's attitude
towards drugs remains blinkered and self-
righteous in the extreme. To me, it stinks
of tabloid politics.
