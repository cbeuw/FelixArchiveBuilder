RCSU Move to Biology
BY THE NEWS TEAM
The Royal College of Science
Union offices will move to tem-
porary accommodation in the
Biology department on
December 4th. Their current
premises in the Old Chemistry
building will become untenable
when the power and water sup-
plies are cut off in preparation
for the building's demolition in
early 1996.
The Union will eventually
move to customised premises in
the Civil Engineering depart-
ment, but they look set to
remain in the temporary accom-
modation until the end of
January. "At the moment there's
very little definite timescale,"
RCS Honourary Secretary Stuart
Jenkins said.
Whilst admitting that they
weren't happy with the situation,
he said that they 'couldn't com-
plain' about the way the Estates
department had treated them,
emphasising that College had
been as helpful as possible.
Val Straw, Facilities
Manager, met the RCSU execu-
tive on Wednesday and
explained that there was no
alternative but to move the
offices into temporary accom-
modation. The Old Royal
College of Science building is
being demolished so that build-
ing of the new Basic Medical
Sciences complex can begin.
Construction of the centre, set
to open in 1997, is already
behind schedule.
RCSU members are con-
cerned that the move will make
it difficult for them to operate
effectively and be readily avail-
able to their members. The new
location will only be accessible to
holders of Biology department
swipe cards outside standard
working hours, keeping most
RCSU members from the
offices.

The pavement in front of the Huxley building was occupied for a
short time on Wednesday as Bangladeshi dissidents demonstrated
outside their Embassy. The protesters declared a hunger strike to
support the previous President, who is gravely ill in hospital, and
needs specialist treatment. Although the group had been met by an
embassy official, they got little attention from South Kensington's
populace.
The Union Executive have
asked the biology department to
allow wider access, but the
RCSU admitted that it was
'extremely unlikely' that such a
breach of college security would
be approved. The RCSU 1920's
fire engine, Jez, will remain in
the condemned chemistry build-
ing for the foreseeable future, as
no alternative garage space is
available.
