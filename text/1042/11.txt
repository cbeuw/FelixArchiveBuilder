Things are not going to plan. I had
already prepared a stinging attack
on the Rag Mag and I was so confi-
dent that it would be as bad as
usual, I nearly didn't bother to buy
a copy. But I was ever eager to 'check ... facts
before writing idlings', and to my total surprise
it's actually quite funny in places. Mind you,
putting an ICU Rag sticker on the Central
London Phone Book would have been a huge
step forward after last year's pathetic attempt.
Last week saw the State opening of
Parliament and the Queen's Speech. Sixteen
bills were announced, the majority of which
seem to be fairly unexciting. The one part that
has caused controversy is the Asylum and
Immigration Bill. The main aim of this legislation
is to cut the number of illegal immigrants and
speed up the acceptance of genuine cases. It will
also cut the level of benefits paid to asylum seek-
ers, in order to deter those seeking a higher stan-
dard of living by masquerading as political
refugees. If properly implemented, this should
not become a racist's charter as predicted by
some organisations, but a way of ensuring that
immigration is conducted fairly and efficiendy,
and a guarantee that the asylum seekers who set-
tie here are those whose well-being is at grave
risk in their home countries, for which this coun-
try has a proud record.
In College, there have been yet more com-
plaints about the installation of the new cannabis
detection system in the halls of residence. To be
fair, it does have additional fea-
tures such as fire detection to
justify its cost, but even by IC
standards, this project has been
catastrophic in the extreme.
The installation has dragged on
for years at God knows what
cost, resulting in false alarms on a near daily basis
for weeks. Given the contempt that people
understandably have for it, one shudders to think
what would happen in the event of a real fire.
It seems that I ruffled the feathers of our
president with my views on her and Ghassan
Karrian and a reinforcement of the points raised
by Nooman Haque. While I stand by what I said,
perhaps I was a little mischievous at times. Sarah
was quiterightabout my failure to read the New
Solutions document, but as she has since very
kindly provided me with a copy I hope to return
to this issue in the future. Atfirstglance, it is cer-
tainly written in more measured tones than the
Trotskyite drivel one gets from the NUS.
I am quite sure that the Editor is not the
only person bewildered at the budgetary
shenanigans across the pond, where Bill Clinton
has tried everything apart from putting Hillary
on the game to keep the government rurming
and pay the treasury bond holders. The explana-
tion for the continuing impasse, boys and girls, is
that Clinton stuck poor old Newt Gingrich, the
Speaker of the House of Representatives, at the
back of Air Force One on the way back from
Israel and didn't talk to him during the flight,
much to his annoyance. And you think our politi-
cians are bad...
