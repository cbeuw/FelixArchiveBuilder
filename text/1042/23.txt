Dear Felix,
I am writing in reply to
Geoff Boon's letter in the Nov.
10th issue of Felix where he
defended Tory grant cuts.
Firstly he fails to mention
that the already minimal stu-
dent grant has been cut by 10%
over the last two years... A
recent survey showed that the
average debt for students
between 18 and 21 is £2,500
rising to £4,500 in the age group
over 26.
This debt along with high
graduate unemployment dis-
courages young people from
working and lower middle class
families from entering higher
education... Another recent sur-
vey has shown that the richest
20% of families receive ten
times more of the money spent
on H E than the poorest 20%...
The cuts in grants reflects the
overall underfunding of educa-
tion in the last sixteen years.
This merely highlights the
short-termism of this govern-
ment. They were happy to
encourage student numbers to 1
in 3 young people but then
abandoned them by failing to
realise the overall long-term
benefits of a well educated
workforce. We now see that our
major competitors are all better
trained and better educated
than us which can only have
detrimental economic effects.
However, Mr Boon wants
to see students paying for the
conservatives to cut taxes for
their rich friends. The promise
of tax cuts for the rich will not
be enough to blind the British
electorate at the next election.
So M r Boon, stop defend-
ing the indefensible and recog-
nise this as yet another flawed
Tory policy.

shaving foam
Now, I do my best to keep a
certain degree of good humour
as I go about my work, and I
didn't particularly mind that I
had large amounts of shaving
foam smeared about my person
this afternoon. It's just, well,
there didn't particularly seem to
be a great deal of point to the
exercise.
It seems perfectly reason-
able that our sabbaticals should
be mocked in public for the sake
of the common good, but the
charming gentlemen who
chained me to the rails of Da
Vincis were singularly incapable
of telling me quite why. 'It's for
Rag! It's for Rag' was all I got,
and they couldn't even tell me
what charities they were sup-
porting.
And I hardly felt inspired to
trust the good judgement of
those fun-loving Raggies in a
week full of allegations of the
Mines Dirty Disco Organisers
drinking the evening's proceeds.
Wednesday night was all a bit
distressing really. There are some
bits of the human anatomy that
really don't look their best being
jiggled around the union foyer.
And, quite frankly, there are
more tasteful places to perform
oral sex.
erratum
The 'Press Officer' of
ConSoc has just been in to say
that he would like to make it
known that the society disclaims
all connection with the letter
from his Chairman opposite. So
now you know.
crimbo spesh'
Next week's Felix will be
the final Friday issue of the term:
we will be preparing a action-
packed bumper Christmas issue
to come out on the final
Wednesday of term, December
13th.
Contributions of any shape
or hue would be lovely (though
those of left-leaning tendencies
will be particularly made a fuss
of to redress the balance!)
