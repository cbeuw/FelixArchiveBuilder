Are you feeling happy? Good. Do you want to
stay that way? Then don't listen to this album.
Yes, those Seattle gloom-meisters, Alice in
Chains, are back with their most impressively
depressive offering yet. Where 1992's bona fide
classic album, 'Dirt', was the fallout from the
band's smack explosions and 1994's incredibly
mellow 'Jar of Flies' was purely the result of too
much pot, the imaginatively tided follow-up
sounds like it was recorded during a period of cold
turkey.
Opening number and current single, Grind',
serves as a precis of the whole affair. Immense,
brooding guitar riffs, off-beat vocal harmonies, an
almost contradictory, pleasant chorus and esoteric
lyrics of, "In the darkest hole you'd be well
advised not to plan my funeral before the body
dies", all combine for maximum morose magni-
tude. You certainly wouldn't want to invite this
band to a party. Not unless it's a funeral party that
is.
But that's not to say that this isn't worthy of
your time. On the contrary, it's only with careful
attention that the nuances and subtie, mysterious
melodies become apparent. It's ironic that the
most obvious and uplifting track is the final one,
with the teasing lines, "Yeah, it's over now, but I
can breathe somehow." I for one hope that this
doesn't refer to the band's existence (as is strong-
ly rumoured). I mean, where else are you going to
go for your lows? (7)

It's been forty minutes and the crowd are impa-
tient. It's not the usual sort of crowd impatience
though. This sort is mixed with real excitement.
This crowd is not just bored of having nothing to
do. Instead, they positively reek of anticipation,
which is not an attitude I had associated with
Buffalo Tom before. And, to be tmthful, this is a
peculiar crowd. Most of London's gig-going com-
munity is over at Earls Court, basking in the Oasis
live experience. The Empire is thus half-filled
with real fans.
Buffalo Tom's entrance is obscured by clap-
ping hands and so only signalled as they quickly go
to work. For some reason, the stage is clotted with
large, plastic trophies, as if this is a prize-giving cer-
emony. It gives the gig a faint air of kitsch which is
weird since common wisdom pegs them firmly in
the country/grunge bracket - fair enough as these
things go, I guess. Anyway, they start, the wall at
the front pogos up and down, and those at the
back nod their heads. In short, everyone is enjoy-
ing themselves and it's still the first song.
They play a long-ish set, inevitably taken
from the new album, 'Sleepy Eyed', and with
progressively fewer from 'Big Red Letter Day'
and beyond. It's all good stuff and while Buffalo
Tom are seldom going to set your life aflame, on
occasions they get close. 'Sunday Night' and
AVhen You Discover' are probably two of the best
songs they've ever written and tonight they're
played like it too.
When Buffalo Tom finish, the clamour for an
encore is furious and heartfelt. There's few
enough bands who actually earn their return, but
Buffalo Tom are worth every second. And they
come back to prove it.

Don't let the title of this album deceive you. The
album cover says it all and you enter a dark and
brooding world of pain and pessimism. You do get
a couple of cheery moments in 'Love Tips Up'
but that's about all you can expect.
If you're on the verge of suicide, I advise you
against listening to this album but then again,
hearing someone else's rough times might be of
some comfort, lb whet your appetite, here are
some typical lyrics from 'Empty Head': "Just
don't be surprised if this permanent paradise
explodes some day into a permanent picture of
pain."
'Judy's Staring at the Sun' is one of the stand-
out tracks on the album, capturing you with its
soaring guitar melody. When I listened to the
music, I felt like it was a summer's day and that I
was lying on a green meadow beneath a clear blue
sky. But, as I heard the lyrics, it all turned black.
Elsewhere, 'Little Muscle' is like a rollercoaster
tide. The verses are the slow steep climbs while
the chorus hurtles you along at breakneck speed.
If you like Soundgarden and Compulsion,
with a litde bit of Queen thrown in on he side, go
out and buy this bumper value fifteen track CD.
It's well worth it. (8)
