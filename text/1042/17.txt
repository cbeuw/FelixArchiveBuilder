When you want your planet saved from aliens
from the 8th Dimension, you don't call a
superhero with his pants over his tights. You call
Buckaroo Banzai, top neurosurgeon, jet car pilot,
particle physicist, vocalist and chief plank spanker
with rock'n'rollers "Buckaroo Banzai & The Hong
Kong Cavalliers". Only he can solve the mystery -
why was everyone born in New Jersy in 1938
named John? Why do they all wear such crappy
suits? And is it a coincidence that 1938 New
Jersy was the scene for Orson Wells' alien invasion
radio show hoax? To find out the answers, come
along on Tuesday at 7pm to the STOIC Studioson
the top floor of the union building.
Also, if you fancy seeing any SF work in
print, how about submitting some material for our
publication ' P A R S E C ?

Yoga Classes
Ever thought about doing something completely
different? If you come to college to expand your
mind, then yoga classes could be just what you've
been looking for.Manage those stress levels using
breathing exercises; improve your flexability by
effective stretching, and discover yourself through
meditation.
There are classes held twice weekly
(Southside G y m : Tuesday 12.15-1.45pm,
Wednesday 2.30-4.00pm), and everyone is
welcome.
Experienced or just curious, it's a great
chance to try something really alternative.

HamSoc
The Amateur Radio Society is back! In the last
few weeks we have been making efforts to bring
the society back into action and now we can
finally announce our first event: 29th November
we will have an open day(12:00-l 5:00) where
anyone interested can come around the HamSoc
shack (top floor Union Building) and find out
more about the society.
There is about £15,000 worth of equipment
available for licensed members to use, and we are
going to be offering lessons to help members that
do not hold an Amateur Radio Licence to obtain
one, or to upgrade their already existing one.
There are also going to be other events, but it
all depends on Y O U R interest. If you hold a
license or you are interested in getting one, or you
just want to find out more about this exciting
hobby of radio communication then do come
along! For more details email adl@doc.ic.ac.uk.
