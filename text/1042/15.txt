James Bond presses the cold steel of his gun to
the head of Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie
Coltraine). The arms dealer and ex-KGB agent
says confidentiy, AValther PPK 7.65mm... only
three men I know use that gun, and I've killed
two of them. Welcome back, Commander
Bond'
This seventeenth James Bond film begins
with a breathtaking bungee jump off the top of
the 750ft Contra Dam, in Switzerland. But this
exciting opening scene is later spoilt when, dur-
ing a getaway, Bond (Pierce Brosnan) manages to
climb into a falling plane in mid-air, and stop it
from crashing! 'My plots are fantastic, while
being often based in truth. They go wildly
beyond the probable but not, I think, the possi-
ble.' Only if you think that nothing is impossi-
ble...
The film is set against a backdrop of the
'thawing' cold war, a world of crime and deceit.
Bond is assigned to retrieve a top secret NATO
helicopter, and investigate the destruction of a
space weapons research centre in the Arctic
Circle.
Brosnan) experiences
the deadly thighs of
Xenia Onatopp
(Famke Jansscn
The mission leads to a meeting with Natalya
Simonova (Isabella Scorupco), a beautiful
Russian computer programmer, who becomes
the latest 'Bond Girl'. Unlike most of the
women in the other films, she's sharp, energetic
and independent, and becomes a useful ally for
Bond. In a world of equal oprxjrtunities and laws
against sexual harassment, the other women in
the film seem to follow this example, where for
the first time the head of MI6, M (Dame Judi
Dench) is a woman.
So the world has changed but Bond hasn't;
he's still the same charming, womanising anti-
hero who drinks his Martinis 'shaken not stirred'.
Only his car has changed, to a BMW 23 roadster
convertible, which looks quite stupid next to the
beautiful but deadly Xenia Onatopp's (Famke
Janssen) Ferrari, in a scene where they race
down a narrow mountain road.
The film is often unbelievable and some-
times even ridiculous, but it's funny and pleas-
antly unpredictable right up to the end, when
James meets his match in his old-friend-turned-
enemy 006, Alex Travelyan (Sean Bean). If you
liked the other Bond films, you'll certainly like
this one — I'm no Bond fan, but I enjoyed it!
