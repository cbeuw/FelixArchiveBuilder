album: the beatles -
anthology 1 babemagnet
Below: The Beatles in Hamburg around
1960 when Ringo wasn't a star(r) and Pete
Best and Stuart Sutcliffe were preparing to
be footnotes in musical history.
The new single, 'Free as a Bird', is slapped at the
start of this double album, sounding processed
and forced. The anthology proper then starts in
1958 with the group's first ever recording. Singles
and live performances, some never previously
released, follow. This part of the anthology (there
are at least two more to come) draws to a close
in 1964.
The music itself is vibrant and due to the live
performances, exciting. With hordes of screaming
fans threatening to drown out the band's sounds,
it's hard not to get swept along.
Gems include a series of rehearsals for and
then a complete recording of 'One After 909', a
live 'She Loves You', and a bluesy 'No Reply'. A
Hard Day's Night' and 'Eight Days a Week' are
also very different to the previously released ver-
sions. Against this, you do have to endure the hor-
ror of a Beades/Morecambe and Wise duet:
This release has to be viewed on two differ-
ent levels; as an historical document and as a
musical piece. It's superlative in the former
aspect, but less impressive in the latter - the col-
lection doesn't offer much that is breathtakingly
new and sound quality is average.
Mind you, whatever reviewers say about this
album, it's going to sell truck-loads. If you're a fan
or want a nostalgia trip, you're going to buy this.
Otherwise, take a listen when you buy it for your
parents for Christmas. (7)
gig: h u m a n league.:alashikov"
With a stage setting like a cross between an
Eighties sci-fi set and a hospital laundry, Human
League appeared in The Royal Albeit Hall as a
blast from the past to a cheering audience.
The audience quickly simmered down as the
band played a mixture of older tracks and pieces
from the 'Octopus' album to distinctly low-key
applause. At a little over three-quarters capacity,
the turnout was disappointing, but as the group
built up to some of their better known tracks, the
crowd came alive again, as did the telescopic linen
baskets dominating the stage.
Culminating initially with 'Tell me when', the
encore again whipped up the public. And with
more classics such as 'Electric Dreams', it was
finally proved that most people can't dance to the
Human League.
album: skyscraper -
superstate^
The British rock behemoth has been dormant for
far too long but Camden trio, Skyscraper have
seen fit to re-awaken it from its
slumber. They tried to kickstart
some life into its corpulent body
eighteen months ago but record
company shenanigans and gener-
al ham-fisted bureaucracy
delayed the release of their debut
album (put your hands up EMI
records and prepare to be shot at). If you were of
a paranoid disposition you might think it was a
conspiracy.
Thankfully, 'Superstate' has arrived on indie
label Dynosupreme and sounds as fresh and
inspiring as it was supposed to. Produced by Roli
Mosimann, who has worked with such industrial
luminaries as the Young Gods and Foetus, the
album consists of songs that take the industrial
foundation and build cmnching guitars, a canny
ear for melody and downright
human emotion on top.
'Union Jack Off' is as visceral yet
articulate diatribe against Fascism
as you're likely to hear.
Elsewhere, 'Lovesick' is self-
effacing but no less vitriolic, while
'Bed of Nails' is a heartfelt num-
ber that grows from slow beginriings into a pulsat-
ing but non-bombastic piece.
The album finishes with vocalist Vic Kemlicz
singing, "There's always hope." For this band
there certainly is. (8)
