ICURFC 2nd
XV’s winning streak lives on
O
n Wednesday,
freshers dis-
covered the
pleasure of
taking public transport
to Fortress Harlington
for our second game of
the season. It was nice to
see that the other team
actually showed up on
time after the 40-minute
game last week. After
a quick but intense and
serious warm-up, strong
motivation came for
the banned players who
wanted a last win with
the boys to end their
season. This meant Im-
perial came firing in the
first 20 minutes of the
game with strong carries
and a dominant scrum
regularly shoving back
UCL’s. Yet, it wasn’t
enough to score due to
small handling errors
and lack of patience in
the opposition 22s. But

was a big
day for the
3s in several
aspects. After a tough loss
the previous week, some
changes to the squad, and
only a few substitutes, it
was integral that everyone
plays to their best form.
On arrival at Fortress
Harlington, we eyed
up the eager opposition
already warming up. It
was hard for some of their
larger players to not catch
our eyes, yet this sight
feared no-one. We got
into our pristine, matching
IC shirts and proceeded
to warm up and prepare
ourselves for the fixture.
It was our kick-off, and
as Marco Violet-Vianello
lofted the ball into the
air, the pressure from our
boys was apparent. Within
a couple of minutes, a big
hit from James King had
sent him into a concussed
state. With one less substi-
tute to support the team,
the start didn’t seem to
look too hopeful. Then, lo
and behold, some simple
hands led the ball to the
right-hand side of the pitch
giving William Ridge the
golden opportunity of an
overlap to secure his first
try. This try set fear into
our opponents, and surely
the regret of the big warm
up session loomed after
they had discovered their
cardio fitness was not up
to scratch.
Shortly after, with
some great pressure
and defence, a double
takedown tackle from
skipper Michael Rudman,
and Will Cox, had caused
a head collision for Will.
After feeling a bit dizzy
and allowing the bump on
his head to make its ap-
pearance, it was decided
that a substitution was
required. Some may argue
that an alternative reason
had caused this substi-
tution, however I beg to
differ. With now a less
His aggressive and deter-
mined driving technique
had surely translated onto
the rugby pitch to help
him score an 80m try,
after picking up the ball
from an error of our op-
position’s. With Arnaud’s
energy high at this point,
he managed to “smoke
their winger and fullback”
in the last 20m, to earn
himself his first IC try.
We now had the con-
fidence, and this allowed
us to show our skills to
the utmost. Tries from the
mighty 3s were flooding in
by now. Olivier Doustaly
managed to use that
chemistry with his fellow
Frenchman Marco as they
executed an S-pattern off
of the back of a scrum to
gain those last 10m past
the try line.
Once again, William
Ridge managed to get
himself another try,
after a dropped ball in
our 22. This allowed
for the fresher to show
his worth by running
through, stepping the 15
and getting that ball down
quick thinking and true
flair on the blind-side
from scrum half Valerio
meant that 2XV veteran
Ifan was over the line
unscathed for the first
try of the game. Unfor-
tunately, errors in de-
fence lead to a scrappy
try by UCL shortly af-
ter. The boys kept their
heads up because we
knew that if we played to
system we would end up
steam-rolling them with
our fitness and flair.
Second try of the
game came very handy
just before half time as
McConkey dove over the
try line after a sick inside
ball from Kirrane. Second
half began just as the first
half did and after a couple
phases it was decided to
take the 3 points to ensure
the victory. After the suc-
cessful kick on the restart,
the ball went wide very
quickly, and fresh prop
ED (@debesh) believed
for a moment that he was
Rieko Ioane and tore the
defence apart with a filthy
step before offering the
try to Sochi who ran the
perfect support line. The
end of the game was very
scrappy but Jespersen
proved to us once again
what he’s capable of.After
breaking a couple tackles
under the sticks.
The opposition utilised
our lack of energy after
running circles round
them to earn themselves
a few tries; however,
this would not destroy
the momentum of the IC
boys. More tries came in
from Tom Watson, and
Jack Martin-Halls with
the excellent assistance of
Ignacio Manzur.
Marco Violet-Vianello
had decided that he
wanted to get himself on
the scoresheet. A lineout
in our favour gave Marco
the chance to show his
flair by getting past the
centres and follow it with
a disgraceful dink of the
ball towards the try line
where we he would meet
to secure that try.
William Ridge had
decided that he wasn’t
finished. The greedy
fresher didn’t like the
thought of having a
smaller percentage of the
total amount of tries. He
used an overlap to earn
himself the hat-trick. But
that still wasn’t enough
for him! Mr Ridge had
certainly got himself an
appetite for tries, so much
so that he saw an oppor-
tunity to take a try from
a cheeky grubber kick of
Marco’s.
After Marco Vio-
let-Vianello had lost that
opportunity to earn that
previous try, he decided
to piss off the opponents
some more. With a few
steps, a twirl and some
large angry UWL props,
Marco was in the try zone.
With a few converted
tries from UWL, the score
at full time came to 59-21
to IC. A great overall
performance from the
boys, with our man of the
match being Marco Vio-
let-Vianello. A thoroughly
deserved W, and I hope
that the team can carry
this momentum through
the training sessions and
into the games to make
this a good season.
down the touch line with
pure pace and strength,
a definitive try therefore
denying him a meat pie
on his last appearance
of the year. Thankfully,
fines were awarded for
this incident. Final score
was 20-7 with IC 2s
continuing their sublime
form despite moving up a
league in what should be
a very exciting year once
again. On a more personal
note, I would like to
thank all the boys for the
unbelievable effort in the
past two games, it was a
pleasure to lead you guys
and I’ll be back next year
with you for more flair
and big Ws.
