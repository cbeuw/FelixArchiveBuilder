Unrest Over New Union Staff Food & Drink Policy
NEWS
Several Beit bars
student staff have
voiced concerns over
the new policy, which
came into effect on 1st
November

Union's new "Staff
Food & Drink
Policy" has come
under heavy criticism
by multiple members of
Union bar staff.
Staff were made aware
of the new policy, which
was drawn up by Julia
Mattingley, the Head of
Commercial Services, on
Monday 29th October.
The new policy, which
came into effect on 1st
November and details
a number of changes to
the rules surrounding
the staff's entitlements to
breaks and to discounted
food and drink during their
shifts, has proven widely
unpopular amongst the
Beit bars student staff.
The aggrieved staff have
pointed out multiple flaws
in the new policy.
"They’re claiming that
the policy is generous.
The discounts are 15% so,
on a £5.50 burger which
we normally would have
got for £3, we now get it
for the price it was before
they increased the prices
last year."
Changes to staff break
entitlements were also
outlined in the policy. The
policy states:
"All staff (agency, per-
manent and student) are
entitled to a discounted
staff meal whilst working
a shift of at least 6 hours."
This immediately
raised concerns given that
a standard morning shift
runs from 11:15 am to
5:00 pm, which falls 15
minutes under the 6 hour
threshold and, thus, leaves
staff with no break and
no food following a shift.
Several staff members
voiced further concerns
about what they perceive
as unfair treatment,
lamenting the fact that
they are no longer entitled
to a free drink during
these morning shifts "even
though they have to do a
3 hour delivery, which is
a lot of heavy lifting and
it takes up a lot of time
and is very intense." An
anonymous Beit bars
student staff member
added, "so they do a lot in
these morning shifts but,
because it’s under 6 hours,
it’s not considered hard
work." In reality, a stipu-
lation of this policy is that
staff will no longer be able
to eat unless they work an
evening shift, which will
then pass midnight.
policy has also been
criticised. The policy
states that workers will
be considered guilty of
theft or gross misconduct
if they breach the policy.
One Beit bars student staff
member explained:
"On particularly busy
shifts, kitchen will make
surplus curly fries because
obviously everyone is
coming in and ordering
curly fries and burgers,
which come with curly
fries. At the end of the
shifts, sometimes there’s
a box or two, not even a
ridiculous amount, and
they’re saying that the
kitchen aren’t allowed
to give that to staff; they
have to throw it in the
bin. Even if the kitchen
is closed. You can’t take
it, it would be stealing.
It’s theft if there’s surplus
chips and you want to
eat them... all food that
isn’t eaten will have to be
thrown away."
One of the Union's
alleged justifications for
this is that "the kitchen
made a 40% profit margin
instead of 60%- that’s not
an acceptable difference
and, because of that, we
need to toughen up on it".
It has also allegedly
been claimed that the
reason for the lack of
margin is because "staff
are basically not follow-
ing the rules with food".
The Union allegedly
further justifies this policy
by claiming “it obeys the
Working Time Directive”.
One Beit bars student staff
member commented: "It
sets the minimum possi-
ble break time you can set
under the Working Time
Directive. The reality is,
on a 13 or 14 hour Sports
night, I’ll get a half hour
break, if that! Which is
the minimum amount they
can give... the fact that the
Union, which is notionally
an organisation that cares
about welfare, is going
for the bare minimum it
can offer its staff in terms
of a break is dubious." It
should also be noted that
the Union has violated the
Working Time Directive
for years, since the direc-
tive requires a minimum
of 11 hours between the
end of one shift and the
start of the next. The
anonymous member
of staff added: "if the
Union is going to go 'the
Working Time Directive
is really important', they
should actually follow the
Working Time Directive
and not just the bits that
benefit them for profit."
A concerned student
told Felix: "It underscores
some of the hypocrisy of
discussions around the
bar... should the Union
have to be dragged into
treating its staff fairly?”
In staff welfare
meetings, there has
been "general unrest".
A member of staff com-
mented:
"There are very limited
benefits and the staff
generally feel unheard
and underappreciated. A
big thing is that the people
who are upstairs in the
Union and on this board
that make these kinds of
policies don’t discuss it
with any of the student
staff. They don’t discuss
it with the casual staff
or the supervisors or the
managers and so these
changes just get imple-
mented without thinking
about how it’s going to
impact us at all. No input
whatsoever. There’s been
a lot of upset and this is
just going to be a massive
kick in the teeth."
The growing unrest
comes amongst claims
of alleged manipulative
abuse, emotional manip-
ulation and work place
bullying within the Beit
bars staff and following
a dispute surrounding
paying Beit bars student
staff the London Living
Wage, which is afforded
to student bar staff at
every other London
university. Last year, Ella
Rice (one of the student
bar managers), started a
petition on this which got
900 signatures. Staff have
even allegedly discussed
taking strike action.

“Everybody
hates this
policy!”
“The entire
attitude of
the Union is
wrong!”
Key features of the
policy include a 15%
discount off the full item
retail price, which will
subsequently see student
staff hit with a significant
price increase, while full
time Union staff will see
a decrease in the price of
their food. An anonymous
Beit Bars student staff
member had the following
to say:
The harsh and ag-
gressive wording of the
“They don't
care about us!”
