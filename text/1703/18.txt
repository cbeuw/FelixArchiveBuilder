The CGCU claims back
its rightful mascot in

‘Davy Lamp’ in the
first mascot theft of
the year

T
he City and
Guilds College
Union (CGCU)
have stolen
the Davy Lamp and a
range of other worthless
memorabilia from the
Royal School of Mines
Union (RSMU) in a raid
to retrieve one of the
CGCU’s most famed
mascots, the Bolt.
Last Saturday, the
CGCU hosted their
Annual Welcome Dinner
aimed at freshers and
thirsty sharks at the
Millennium Gloucester
Hotel, proudly display-
ing their two mascots
throughout the night: the
29kg (64lb) solid bronze
Spanner and the 31kg
(68lb) Bolt. Several hours
after the event concluded,
the Bolt was reported
missing to members of
the CGCU committee by
President, Andrew Hill.
In a clear show of bravado
from the CGCU, the Bolt
had been left unattended
within the Union building
for a substantial period
of time. Unsurprisingly,
it was then swiped by an
RSMU member, despite
inviolacy.
After a cryptic message
from the RSMU Presi-
dent, Marta Wolinska,
simply “walked straight
in”. There has been no
official communication
from the CGCU on the
means of entry as of yet.
Later on Monday night,
a series of compromising
images were “leaked”
online by the Memeperial
Facebook page, continu-
ing their six-month trend
of not actually posting any
memes. One photograph
of the culprits posing as
Royal College of Science
Union (RCSU) members
received criticism from
the RCSU’s ex-President,
UNMASKED! The CGCU’s vigilante heroes // Andrew Hill
Michael Edwards, who
said, “It’s blindingly
obvious that this was a
false flag – the RCSU is
completely incapable of
stealing mascots”. Not
long after, a second image
was uploaded purporting
to show the real perpetra-
tors: a diverse subset of
the CGCU committee.
The CGCU is yet to
issue an official ransom
note including demands
which will lead to the safe
return of the Davy Lamp.
Mascot pundits speculate
that the CGCU may ask
RSMU members to drop
out and take real degrees
instead.

A
t this time of
year, the rare
Alice Ghast
has been spot-
ted roaming the halls
of Imperial. Although
famously an elusive
creature that will not
respond to meeting re-
quests with people that
associate with Divest
and Left Forum, stu-
dents report hearing her
moaning the following
rhyme:
“Hubble bubble toil
and trouble, let my annual
salary double.”
Although aware that
this rhyme does not match
the original Shakespeare,
which replaces hubble,
bubble with double,
double, the ghostly appa-
rition felt that quadruple
would stretch both the
university budget and the
English language too far.
Students wishing to
avoid the hostile atten-
tions of the Ghast have
found the following
advice scrawled on the
wall in what appeared
to be blood: leave out an
offering equivalent to
your yearly tuition fees in
a currency of your choice,
be it gold, internal organs
or, most importantly,
London property.
The student reaction
the DPFS for some petty
cash, seeing as they’re
only spending it on
beers that aren’t Stella.”
Another student said, “I
just don’t know why she
wasted all that blood on a
creepy message. Doesn’t
she know that you can get
up to $350 for a bag with
the right customer? How
does she think I’m paying
my tuition fees, SFE dried
up last week and I’m 1.5
grand into my overdraft.”
The real question now is
how to rid the students of
this dangerous ghoul? One
suggestion from an active
member of left-forum
was to “increase political
engagement of the student
body to counter such pay
rises.” Naturally this was

Spotted @ Imperial... Alice Ghast
This week your glucose
guardian suddenly passes
away, without even
mentioning your name in
his will.
This isn’t how you
expected to get ghosted.
This week you wake up
from a vivid nightmare
in cold sweats, only to
wake up realising that it’s
tyou’re still at Imperial.
This some Freddy
Krueger bullshit.
This week you’re Deputy
President (Clubs &
Societies). You have to
choose between a Ouija
board or CSPB. Either
way you’re opening up
a portal to hell. Come
through, departed spirit.
This week you remember
your parents didn’t raise
you to be partaking in all
this demonic nonsense.
ACC? Not when there’s
Hallelujah-ween night
vigil at chuch instead.
This week you’re a Union
bouncer during ACC.
Bored, you play a game
of ‘Spot the Offensive
Costume’. You soon
realise it might be more
fun to play that the other
way around.
This week you’re a
bloodsucking vampire
who preys on poor
deprived university
students.
Oh wait never mind;
you’re Alice Gast again.
This week you drink
a Draught of Living
Death. The effects are
instantaneous.
That’s the last time you
let your friends mix
drinks at pres.
This week you think your
neighbour’s a witch -
her black cat is always
watching you and you’re
sure she keeps hexing
your heating.
Maybe you should go
drop off her Amazon
packages from April.
This week you see a
hoard of zombies queuing
in the Library café. Is the
apocalypse nigh?!
Wait no, they’re just final
year students leaving
after an all-nighter.
This week it’s cold
outside - perfect weather
for some Netflix and
Chill. For some reason
your MCM wants to
watch ‘The Human
Centipede’. Nah screw
that; pack up and go.
This week you’re craving
brains. Fortunately,
there part of the new
Fusion menu - with
complimentary sweet
chilli and hot sauce for
your seasoning-deficient
zombie tastebuds .

office”, was decoded by

students in the rivalling
CGCU office, the CGCU
carried out raid on the
RSMU office shortly
after dusk on Monday
evening. It is unknown
how the intruders gained
access to the room, but
one concerned Materials
lecturer reported seeing a
group of shifty students
dusting white forensics
powder over the door
handle. Another spectator
remarked that the group
“Hubble
bubble toil and
trouble, let my
annual salary
double”
to this ghostly apparition
has mostly been one of
pedantry. One student
said, “I can’t believe that
she altered Shakespeare
as a crude demand for
more money. Just go ask

and the final conclusion
was to sacrifice a fresher
a week until the ghoul left
as per rugby policy.
