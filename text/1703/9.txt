A
nother iPad was
introduced this
week - the iPad
Pro. It isn’t,
however, just another iPad
as this is said to have the
biggest changes ever and
will push the functionality
of these devices farther
than ever before.
This model has a
11-inch and 12.9-inch
Liquid Retina displays to
the edges of iPad Pro. It
also has an “A12X Bionic
chip with next-generation
Neural Engine in iPad
Pro”, which outperforms
most PC laptops. It offers
a new “USB-C connector,
Gigabit-class LTE, and
up to 1TB of storage to
enable powerful new
mobile workflows”.
Remember how you
had to charge the Apple
Pencil with the charging
cord and you sometimes
weren’t sure whether it
was charging or not? Well,
the second-generation
Apple Pencil attaches to
the iPad Pro magnetically
and charges wirelessly
while doing so. Now,
you can also tap with the
pencil more easily than
before thanks to a new
touch sensor built into it.
There is also a new Smart
Keyboard Folio with a
streamlined design that’s
adjustable for increased
versatility.
“The new iPad Pro is
a huge step forward for
powerful, creative, mobile
computing... There has
never been a mobile
device anything like the
new iPad Pro; it has a
gorgeous edge-to-edge
Liquid Retina display that
curves into the corners…
and more, all packed into
a thinner device that has
all-day battery life and
is 25 percent smaller in
volume.”
The new Liquid Retina
display in iPad Pro is made
of precision-milled glass,
advanced pixel masking,
new backlight design and
sub-pixel antialiasing.
This makes it the brightest
and most color accurate
iPad display, with wide
color support, True Tone
and anti-reflective coating
for a natural, accurate
viewing experience.
Face ID, which is
thought to be the “most
secure facial authentica-
tion system in any tablet
or computer”, has been
installed in the new iPad
Pro for the first first time.
It is designed to work
in any orientation, no
matter if you are sitting
or standing while using
the iPad. This is because
it takes advantage of the
TrueDepth camera system
to accurately map and
recognize the face. It also
can be used for Apple Pay,
to gain access to secure
apps and enable Animoji
and Memoji.
The iPad Pro, Apple
Pencil and Smart
Keyboard Folio are
available to order starting
from the 30th of October
and are set to hit the
stores from Wednesday,
November 7th.
Artificial Intelligence for Social Good
G
oogle.org is an
arm of Google
that aims to
support non-
profits through grants and
contributing employee
volunteer hours. The $25
million pool announced
recently aims to support
any ideas of situations
where AI could be realis-
tically applied. Winning
organisations would not
only receive funding, but
also support in imple-
menting their ideas. This
support would be tailored
to the organisation and
could include coaching
from Google employees
with expertise or experi-
ence in AI, and credit and
consulting from Google
Cloud.
A wave of ethical
ambiguity has recently
swept over Silicon Valley,
as Google and other tech
giants have been faced
with scenarios where it
is difficult to tell how
research in AI may be
used in the future. For
example, the military
have shown interest in
artificial intelligence for
autonomous weapons, in
initiatives such as Project
Maven. Facial and image
recognition powered by
AI may have applications
in surveillance.
While these topics are
relatively controversial
from their very nature, AI
has its doubters in other
applications as well where
human judgement plays
an important role. This
is because of the nature
of AI as a black box
that does something the
user doesn’t necessarily
understand. Biases within
the training datasets used
may lead to implications
in the outputs, and this
makes use of AI in law
or medicine, for example,
worrying to many experts
and organisations.
Publishing data and
algorithms involved goes
a certain distance in ad-
dressing this concern, but
with recent more powerful
machine learning tech-
niques, the inner workings
can tend to be spun into
a more opaque web that
would be impossible
to decipher even with
transparent data. New
methods are being tested
and developed for giving
some kind of an insight to
end users on the workings
of these systems.
The AI for Social Good
program, announced on
Monday, would hope to
address these concerns,
while not compromising
on Google’s commitment
to the advancement in use
of AI, which it sees itself
as having an important
role in. As Jeff Dean, the
head of Google’s BrainAI
division said, “It’s really
important for us to show
what the potential for AI
and machine learning
can be, and to lead by
example.”
