Man Booker Prize winner: Milkman a “challenging” read

T
he first thing one
notices about
Anna Burns’
Milkman is the
lack of names. The closest
thing our protagonist gets
to one is “middle sister”,
and the setting is only
ever referred to obliquely,
and its characters by
sobriquet. There is one
particularly fantastic early
scene in which middle
sister’s maybe-boyfriend
is accosted on charges of
possessing a bit of a car
with a flag from “over
the water” on it. That was
when the penny finally
dropped for me, but I
might just be slow.
The second thing you
notice is the language.
The novel is almost
entirely middle sister’s
inner monologue, and the
language is not what one
would expect from an 18-
year-old girl growing up
in working class Belfast
during The Troubles. Her
thoughts are bizarrely
prosaic, and Burns’ style
disorientating. Her char-
acters are difficult to dis-
tinguish from each other
– throughout the dialogue
all the characters speak in
the same oddly stilted and
long-winded manner.
Kwame Anthony
Appiah, Chair of the Man
Booker Prize panel, called
it “challenging in the
way a walk up Snowdon
is challenging”, and it
is – it truly stretched the
limits of my suspension of
belief.
However, through this
style, Burns has managed
to make every word,
every paragraph, every
page feel overwrought
and overthought, which
perfectly captures the
outstanding tension of her
setting. Her attention to
detail and the vernacular
conveyed a sense of place
to an extent that would
be unachievable by mere
description.
This comes at the cost
of making Burns’ novel
largely impenetrable.
Appiah said that his time
spent reading academic
papers on philosophy
were good preparation.
For the reader attempting
Milkman without such
training, it is easy to
imagine the book being a
tough read. There is more
or less no plot for the first
two-thirds of the novel,
but when the tension es-
calates and things come to
a head, Burns handles the
narrative deftly.
In the buildup to the
action, we are treated to
over two hundred pages
of tension-building and
characterisation. There
are, of course, flashes of
action (such as the afore-
mentioned scene with
maybe-boyfriend’s car
bits), but these are more
or less glossed over by
Burns as she rushes to in-
troduce the next character
or drop the next nugget of
setting-related exposition.
To some extent, this
is also part of the point.
Middle sister wants a
quiet life: she reads 19th
century literature whilst
walking to avoid having
to interact with people,
and would rather not have
the ‘future talk’ with may-
be-boyfriend. When plot
happens to her it is always
an inconvenience, and the
prose treats it as such.
This wouldn’t matter
so much if the tension
built to a satisfying pay
off, but it does not. We
are, in principle, told what
the climax of the novel is
on page one: Somebody
McSomebody is going
to assault middle sister
and her IRA stalker, the
eponymous Milkman, is
going to die. In actuality,
the climax of Milkman
features an assortment
of minor side characters;
when you finally reach
the bit you’re promised
at the start, you could
easily miss it in that haze
of action you’ll almost
Anna Burns is the first Northern Irish writer to win the prestigious award for her Troubles-era novel Milkman.

There’s probably a
way in which this, too, is
intentional, but really it
just makes the novel feel
unsatisfying to me. I think
this generally sums up
my position on Milkman:
it’s an incredibly clever
novel that is overflowing
with literary merit, and
certainly enough to justify
the Man Booker prize.
However, it is also impen-
etrable and occasionally a
touch boring.
It’s certainly worth
a read if you’re a fan
of seeing the English
language used in new
ways, and a book on
Northern Irish issues
getting publicity right
now is probably not a bad
thing. But probably, for
the vast majority of the
reading public it’s just not
worth sitting through all
that build-up for what is
an extremely well-writ-
ten and engaging, but
ultimately disappointing,
conclusion.
