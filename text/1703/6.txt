Elections: It’s Gonna Be Rough, Folks
Left Forum’s last surviving committee member and chief lockpicker gives his views on the
inevitable travesty that will be the outcome of the American midterms.

elcome one
and all to the
continuing
s h i t s h o w
saga that is the American
political spectacle. When
you last tuned in in 2016,
the Ur-fascist narrowly
beat out the neoliberal
cancellation of the future,
and we’ve been on a wild
ride for the last two years
as Republican majorities
in Congress and a stacked
SCOTUS run rampant.
In this piece, Felix
picks apart the whys and
whens; candidates and
races to watch, forecasting
and polling, and what this
all means down the line.
Firstly - where do we
get this stuff, anyways?
The Cook Political Report
inveryhighregard,aswith
Sabato’s Crystal Ball and,
obligatorily, FiveThirtyE-
ight (and if you’re a fan
of satire, good ol’ Chapo
Trap House). Felix only
gets one issue a week,
folks; best hunting for up-
to-date info elsewhere.
First up: I’m endorsing
a straight-Dem ballot.
They’re practically Tories
anyways - at least the bad
ones (i.e. most of them).
Don’t @ me, have you
seen the news lately?
As always, send all
angry correspondence to
comment editor Charlie
Titmuss, please (and,
while you’re at it, get a
life).
So what’s happening
anyways?
Congressional and
gubernatorial elections.
Governors in a handful of
states are up for election,
as are some locals (town
selectman, or whatever -
nobody cares).These folks
often turn into presidential
candidates, but there’s not
much interesting (at least
since Cynthia Nixon lost
her bid in the primaries to
Andrew Cuomo in NY).
The really spicy races
are for the House. 35
Senate seats are up, but
they’re mostly held by
Dems, and hence there’s
not much chance at all to
break the majority (538: 1
in 7 chance as of writing).
However, Democrats
are projected to take the
House (538: 6 in 7).
How’s it been going?
Interestingly. Candi-
dates like Beto O’Rourke
have given candidates like
Ted Cruz (R-TX) runs for
their money - literally.
O’Rourke raised lots of
dosh, and Republicans
ended up spending more
in the state than they
anticipated (remember,
two years ago Cruz was
thought to be presidential
material, or at least by
degenerates). The race
is a toss-up. Others,
like Andrew Janz (v.
incumbent Devin Nunes,
R-CA-22) have run fairly
competitive races (though
Nunes’s real opponent
is the Fresno Bee). Un-
fortunately, Janz doesn’t
see to be able to pull off
the balance - the district
is currently forecast as
likely R.
The Republicans are
their same loathsome
selves. “DON’T INTER-
RUPT ME, JASON!”
Cruz snapped at a debate
moderator asking him
about civility in politics.
They’re dog-whistling
racists and are more de-
cidedly pro-Trump than
ever. I guess this is how
a cult of personality is
established?
More macro-view plz.
Okay; Democrats need
to pick up 23 seats for a
majority in the House.
The NY Times estimates
(among races in districts
not dyed in the wool) 15
seats that lean Dem, held
mostly by Republicans,
and about 30 tossups - all
Republicans. There are
another 29 lean-R seats
that are already R; the
Dems should then have
the mileage they need
to pick up the majority.
FiveThirtyEight is calling
a +39 seat gain for the
Democrats on average,
with an 80% chance of
picking up anywhere
between 19 and 59 seats.
This will get us there.
Republicans, on the
other hand, are expected
to pick up a seat or two
in the Senate. This is
somewhat unfortunate -
slim margins are always
better when whippping
votes isn’t really a thing
- but as long as the gain
is small, it’s manageable,
especially with control of
the House.
Will the blue wave
actually come about?
There’s the regular ol’
opposition surge (folks
content with the status
quo are not as motivated
to vote as those who
don’t like what’s going
on). Couple this with
anti-Trump sentiment and
you have a storm on your
hands.
Remember: this is a
president who hit his-
torically-low approval
ratings (he’s hovering at
around 40% now - higher
than usual, but most of
the people pulling that
lever foam at the mouth,
so take it with a grain of
salt). His administration
is objectively the worst in
American history. We’re
living a nightmare that
never seems to end (has it
really been near two years
already?).
Consequently, there has
been a massive surge in
early voting. Early voting
among young people is
up 500% in Georgia, with
historic highs hit around
the country; turnout is
projected to be up 150%
over the 2014 midterms
(mirroring the 2016 elec-
tions, 50% of the 18-to-29
demographic voted, as
opposed to the pitiful
19.9% turnout in the 2014
midterms) - a good bell-
weather for turnout here,
considering anti-Trump
sentiment is concentrated
in young voters.
Another factor is the
prevalence of identity
politics in the current
political climate - with
just cause, considering
the present administra-
tion. For example, trans
rights do not matter in
the slightest to the current
administration. Coupled
with fiery rhetoric, the
current political climate is
experienced as an existen-
tial threat to trans people.
Extend that - do you guys
remember Mike Pence as
the guy who wanted to
electroshock gay people

into being straight with
funding taken from AIDS
treatment? Maybe we
could bring back lynching,
just this one time.
People are still sen-
sitive to the id-pol case
against Trump; it’s a valid
argument worth listening
to, and it’s gonna move
voters to the polls.
Then again, there
are some not-so-good
features of the election
that definitely don’t work
in the Dems’s favor. For
example, voting machines
in Texas have been
changing Beto votes to
Ted Cruz (and somewhat
vice versa, though
most of the reports I’ve
heard suggest it’s going
majority towards Ted).
Election machines are
ludicrously compromised;
Georgian infrastructure
isn’t even supported by
the vendor any more. Ger-
rymandering also affects
House races, providing
a systemic disadvantage
to Democrat voters (to
the extent that they need
~55% of the popular vote
to take the House).
And there’s the usual
voter suppression efforts...
What’s this about
voter suppression?
Voter fraud is not a
big deal. There were four
cases of voter fraud in the
2016 elections. Unfortu-
nately, this does not stop
Fox News from adopting
the concept into their
rhetoric. This is a pretext
to carry out broad vot-
er-suppression efforts - in
the form of stringent and
surprisingly-early voter
registration deadlines,
ludicrous voter ID laws,
and closing ballot boxes
in cities with majority-mi-
nority individuals (e.g.
Dodge City, Kansas - a
town with 30,000 Latino
folks and not one single
polling place).
Obviously, these
efforts are kept somewhat
hush-hush (nobody
wants to be known to act
anti-democratically, after
all), but the idea is to
give an edge in marginal
cases. If you’re working
two full-time jobs to make
rent, do you have the time
or energy to drive an hour
to the next city over just
to pick up your special
voter ID (in some states,
not even your driver’s
license is sufficient). This
brings about a dispropor-
tionate turnout - the few
percentage points needed,
in many cases, to eke an
election (or at least to
improve your odds).
Take the race for
governor of Georgia -
Democrat Stacey Abrams
is subject to the rules set
by secretary of state Brian
Kemp. Her opponent?
Brian Kemp. One bus full
of black seniors heading
towards the polls was
intercepted by the police.
One “exact match” ID
law he passed threatens
to suppress 50,000 voters.
Jimmy fucking Carter
stepped out of retirement
to tell Kemp to resign.
Kemp’s response has
been to dogwhistle about
“outside agitators” -
familiar to anyone who
studied the Civil Rights
Movement, because this
is how leaders would
speak about black people
without really speaking
about black people. So
much so, in fact, that the
term has its own fucking
Wikipedia article.
How is Trump
reacting?
Well, Trump’s new
thing is promising to
cancel the 14th amend-
ment - jus soli, or citi-
zenship from birth in the
country. This has been
well-established (and
well-tested) law since
the 1890s and has its
roots in being one of the
ones passed because of
the whole slavery thing.
Obviously Trump doesn’t
like the position - so, he
thinks he can write an
executive order to trample
the Constitution (hahaha -
it doesn’t work like that).
There’s also the
bullshit caravan story. It’s
better as a jazz standard,
IMO. God, I hope this
gasbag implodes.
And the rest of the
Republicans?
Cowardly. Absolutely
cowardly. Apparently
they’ve been begging the
Democrats not to do any
digging, because they
know in their hearts the
Dems will pick the House
back up, and it’ll be a
bad time for Rohrabacher
(R-CA) and anyone like
him. They have skeletons
in the closet and that
closet will be pried open.
What’s next?
The Republicans will
take the Senate.
Besides the obvious
maintained control over
every branch of govern-
ment, a Republican House
would be a nightmare;
it will be read as tacit
approval of the status quo,
and McConnell, Trump,
& Co. will be more em-
boldened than ever, and
give even more license
to those working in bad
faith to prevent mean-
ingful investigation into
the wrongdoings of the
present administration.
Current forecasts say this
eventuality is unlikely,
but the prospect alone is
rather bleak. Additionally,
the success of voter sup-
pression tactics remains
to be seen - the Abrams-
Kemp race, for example,
is currently in a dead heat.
If the Dems take
Congress, though - all
of a sudden, committee
control will be passed to
Sanders cheering the wrecking of the neolibs. Blessed image. // Wikimedia
the blues, and it becomes
much more difficult for
Republicans to impede
investigations (into, for
example, emoluments
clause violations - of
which Trump is very, very
guilty).
In terms of the Dem-
ocrats - bellweather
primaries in MA and NY
showed that the progres-
sive wing of the party
is gradually picking up
steam; as the districts are
dyed-blue, we will greet a
small but growing cohort
of millennial candidates
- who even describe them-
selves as socialists! While
the libs on top (Pelosi,
Schumer, et al) want to
maintain their neoliberal
hegemony, the narrative
is shifting, as it must;
running another centrist
neoliberal in 2020 would
be suicide. Candidates are
beginning to posture for
the race already; Sanders
is the clear frontrunner,
with others (Biden,
Bloomberg, Booker)
lining up.
The Dems will oppose
Trump; that much is
certain. Whether or not
they’ll split like bad mayo
is another. We’re in for a
raucous few years, folks.
What’s this about the
Dems?
Obviously the centrist
position has hit the
bumpers. Nobody takes
id-pol rhetoric without
support for socio-eco-
nomic programs and
projects such as nation-
alized infrastructure
banking, Medicare for all,
expanded Social Security,
and free/cheaper univer-
sity tuition. Without these
programs, individuals are
left living precarious lives;
they become isolated,
atomized - they begin to
believe that there is no
coherent policy option to
rectify their woes, as none
are seriously discussed in
the upper echelons of the
political establishment.
This is the standard
critique of neoliberalism.
This is not to say the
cultural positions are bad;
this is only to say that the
political basis is incom-
plete, and the cancellation
of debate on these issues
forces individuals to seek
alternatives - like Trump.
Trump’s nomination
was a perfect storm; the
election could’ve been
had if Clinton had put
forth better ideological
projects, as opposed to
her bullshit appeal to
realpolitik. Not exactly
inspirational.
The point is that we’re
looking at a very different
political landscape in the
next few months, one
where the Dems will have
much more ground for cri-
tiquing Trump, and much
more power to enforce it.
But if they make the same
mistake as in 2016, they
are bound to lose in 2020.
Any parting words?
This is bullshit.
“The point

Dems] make
