En vogue: The Least Pretentious Art Fair in London

The Affordable Art Fair
is a showcase of all of the
best new artwork availa-
ble to be bought by your
average Imperial-stu-
dent-turned-banker that
takes places twice a year in
Battersea Park. Although
its use of the word ‘af-
fordable’ is about as apt
as the word’s application
to the £400,000 studio
flats which overlook the
park, it remains one of the
best events in London for
viewing a much broader
range of contemporary
art than you might find
hanging in the Tate or the
Saatchi Gallery.
Over a hundred delega-
tions from across the UK
and from further afield
are present at the fair,
representing artists from
the likes of Damien Hirst
all the way through to
fresh graduates from the
country’s top art schools.
As is often the case with
something that has such a
broad remit, it is really a
fair in two halves: that of
the landscapes, cityscapes,
riverscapes, beachscapes,
and seascapes that you
might want to hang
in your affordable flat
once you land that sweet
consulting gig at BCG;
and that of the en vogue,
avant-garde, ‘proper art’
which you might alter-
nately scoff at or try to
seem interested by in an
attempt to impress that
SOAS student you fancy.
Stand out artists from
the first group this year
include Jim Farrant and
David Axtell’s nostalgic
portrayals of seaside
escapes (particularly
good for that affordable
Cornish beach house
you’ll be owning), Guil-
laume Cornet’s quirky
and colourful isometric
cityscapes (think Habbo
Hotel crossed with
classic Sim City), Paul
Powis’s vibrant, pop-arty,
impressionist landscapes
(perfect for a cozy kitchen
complete with a nice
affordable Aga), and John
Hammond’s fantastic
portrayals of London,
both indoors and out, that
do well to capture the
atmosphere and bustle of
the city.
Firmly within the remit
of the second group are
all those many and varied
interpretations of what
seemed to be this autumn’s
key theme of circles. We
had concentric circles
(Paolo Ceribelli and Chris
Wood), origami circles
(Caroline Preston), folded
concentric circles (Peter
Monaghan), slightly
off-centric circles (Geoff
Catlow), a sculpture of
concentric circles on a
sphere (Dee Stanford),
and even a collection of
coloured circles from
Damien himself.
Your author isn’t
entirely sure why the
theme of circles is so
strong this year but is
convinced it’s possible
to somehow link it to
Brexit and leaves this as
an exercise for the reader.
Other themes from this
year included lone trees,
cartoonish cities, and
various combinations of
all of the above.
It probably hasn’t
escaped your attention
that all of the artists
mentioned so far have
been white and Western.
In general, across the fair,
as in art in general, some
more diversity in both
the subject matter and
the provenance of the art
would have been appre-
ciated; particularly when
staring at the 10,000th
cityscape of New York,
Paris, or London.
It was refreshing to
arrive at the stall of
ArtBlue Studio from
Singapore, one of the few
galleries from outside
the Western world,
which featured such eye
candy as Bui Van Hoan’s
poignant monochrome
Vietnamese riverscapes
and Lieu Nguyen Huong
Duong’s breathtakingly
pretty cherry blossoms.
All in all, the AAF
remains an excellent way
to spend a Saturday after-
noon; particularly if you
want to learn more about
art beyond the somewhat
pretentious headline
pieces that win the Turner
Prize (second group plus-
plus).
The evolution of the
art at fairs such as this is
always much more rapid
than at static galleries and
so it’s also a good way to
keep up to date with the
cutting edge. Entry was
£11 (student advance),
glasses of champagne to
celebrate your affordable
purchase were £9.50, and
the fair will be back in
Battersea next spring.
Landscapes, cityscapes and concentric circles are all the rage this autumn at the Affordable Art Fair in Battersea.
