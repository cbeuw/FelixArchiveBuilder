Bombs dropped during WWII had effects even at the
“edge of space”

“Over the
course of the
war, Allied
forces dropped
more than
2.75 million
tons of TNT,
equivalent to
185 Hiroshima
H-bombs.”
W
orld War II
is widely
k n o w n
to be the
most devastating and
deadly war in the history
of mankind. However,
the study of its impacts
beyond Earth is very
recent and could play a
major role in improving
modern technologies. In
a study published last
month, professor of astro-
physics Chris Scott and
historian Patrick Major
from the University of
Reading reveal that the
shockwaves produced by
Allied bombs dropped on
European cities during
WWII reached the edge
of space, and temporarily
weakened the ionosphere.
The ionosphere is a
thick band in the outer
atmosphere situated
between 80km and 580km
above the surface of
Earth. It is formed due to
atmospheric absorption of
X-raysandultravioletlight
from the sun, and is very
sensitive to solar activity
such as the emission
of particles carrying
energy, high-speed solar
winds and coronal mass
ejection. These events
can cause variances in
the concentration of ions
and electrons in the ion-
osphere, and thus cause
it to become electrified.
The study shows that
the bombing raids were
powerful enough to
periodically decrease the
concentration of electrons
in the ionosphere, which
could have interfered with
the radio communications
at low frequencies during
the conflict.
The researchers
compared daily measure-
ments of the ionosphere
collected between 1943
and 1945 by the Radio
Research Centre in the
UK city of Slough, to
the time and dates of 152
important Allied bombing
raids over France and
Germany during the same
period. They found that
changes in the ionosphere
were occurring after
these raids, which were
meticulously recorded by
the German authorities
and in the Royal Air Force
mission logbooks. Its
“critical frequency,” or in
other words the frequency
of the radio waves reflect-
ed by the ionosphere’s
constituent particles, de-
creased – which lead to a
drop in the concentration
of electrons. To describe
the process mechanisti-
cally, energy released by
the shockwaves heated
the ionosphere, which
then enabled the electrons
to gain enough kinetic
energy to escape from the
ionosphere.
Although temporary
reductions in the con-
centration of electrons
is usually due to the sun,
or are caused by natural
phenomena on Earth such
as earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions and lightning,
“it is astonishing to see
how the ripples caused
by man-made explosions
can affect also the edge
of space,” say the authors.
The paper reminds us that
over the course of the
war, the Allied air forces
dropped more than 2.75
million tons of TNT – the
equivalent of 185 Hiro-
shima H-bombs – and
that “each raid released
the energy of at least 300
lightning strikes.”
One may wonder why
the study didn’t focus
on German bombing
raids which occurred
closer to Slough, where
the measurements were
taken, such as the well-
known “London Blitz”
which took place between
September 1940 and
May 1941. As C. Scott
explains, “this bombing
was more or less contin-
uous, making it difficult
to separate the impact
of wartime raids from
those of natural seasonal
variability.” Furthermore,
the Allied four-engine
planes could carry bombs
four times heavier than
the two-engine German
planes, which caused
greater disruption and
produced a clearer signal.
This research may also
have a significant impact
on solving present-day
scientific problems.
Understanding the effect
of manmade atmospher-
ic disturbances could
improve communications
and global positioning
systems (GPS) technol-
ogy, which rely on the
ionosphere. For example,
airplanes had to come
back to their base in
October 2003 due to GPS
inaccuracies, which were
caused by disruptions in
the ionosphere after an
intense storm on the sun.
More accurate knowledge
of the ionosphere and the
effects of disturbances
could thus help develop
prediction models useful
for our modern technolo-
gies.
While the effects of
the bombing raids on the
ionosphere resulted in no
long-term consequences
for the atmosphere, the
destruction they caused
on the surface of Earth
remain indelible marks
in the world’s landscapes,
towns, and also in the
memory of survivors. The
historian involved with
the study, Patrick Major,
reminds us of some of
their experiences, such
as “aircrew involved in
the raids reporting having
their aircraft damaged by
the bomb shockwaves,
despite being above the
recommended height”
or “residents under the
bombs routinely recalling
being thrown through the
air by the pressure waves
of air mines exploding,
and window casements
and doors would be blown
off their hinges.”
Studying the past to
understand the present is
one message to take from
this pioneering work. We
should never forget “the
images of neighbourhoods
across Europe reduced to
rubble due to wartime air
raids, lasting reminder of
the destruction that can
be caused by man-made
explosions”.
