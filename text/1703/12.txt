dream sequence, where
Bobbie sees flashes of
what her life would be as a
married woman. A Bobbie
who’s pregnant. A Bobbie
who’s just given birth.
Several Bobbies-of-what-
could-be fill the stage.
This is both intimidating
and wonderful to see, as
it gives the most clear
glimpse into Bobbie’s
head than anything else in
the play.
It is also important to
point out that the play
looks incredible. The
impact of developing
technology is clear, and
it makes a fifty year old
play feel fresh as if it was

Company
Sondheim’s classic gets a facelift - and it’s absolutely beautiful.
A
s I walked
to my seat
in Gielgud
Theatre, the
main worry I had was
whetherswappingthegen-
ders in this classic musical
would be anything more
than an audience-grabbing
gimmick.
Well, it did work. I
was there, praying that
it would add more than
advertising value to the
show.
The play explores
different stages of mar-
riages from Bobbie’s
perspective through a
series of vignettes. It’s
Bobbie’s (Bobby in Sond-
heim’s original play) 35th
birthday, and her friends,
her “married friends”, as
Bobbie (Rosalie Craig)
likes to put it, throw a
surprise party to celebrate
the occasion. All her
friends want to know the
same thing, though. When
is Bobbie going to get
married?
Thanks to the reversal
of genders, there is
more at stakes than just
peer-pressure; female
Bobbie’s biological clock
is also racing throughout
the play. This is no longer
a show about a man with
commitment issues. It is
so much more. Just this
alone makes this change
worthwhile. It is not a
ground-breaking change,
but it makes the play feel
fresh.
Bobbie is not the only
character whose gender
has been changed. Amy
has now become Jamie,
introducing a gay couple
into the play. This works
wonderfully, as it makes
the play beautifully
inclusive without feeling
forced. Bobbie’s three
love interests are also
gender-swapped, paving
the way for interesting
yet valuable commentary
about dating, and the
different dating behaviour
that is (but should not be)
expected from men and
women. The couple of
David and Jenny is role-
flipped, portraying the
image of a bread-winning
wife and a stay-at-home
dad, once again, compli-
cating the previously ste-
reotypical picture of the
roles of men and women
in marriages.
Company is credited to
be one of the first “concept
musicals”. Despite not
“Thanks to
the reversal of
genders, this
is no longer
a show about
a man with
commitment
issues”
“a fifty year
old play ...
fresh as if it
was written
yesterday”
having a linear plot, not
only is it easy to follow,
the different vignettes
connect together nicely to
feel like a cohesive piece.
This is greatly helped by
Sondheim’s timeless com-
positions, which are, at
times, absolutely genius.
‘Ladies Who Lunch’,
performed masterfully by
the iconic Patti LuPone
is just the right degree
of resentful and bitter,
yet absolutely tasteful.
LuPone, who previously
undertook the role in the
2011 New York Phil-
harmonic Concert, nails
the role of Joanne and
delivers a multi-faceted
performance.
‘Getting Married
Today’, a monster of a
song to perform, and a
definite highlight of the
show, is performed skil-
fully by Jonathan Bailey
who is pitch perfect,
both vocally and with his
acting. Originally written
for a female character, it
is refreshing to watch a
male character get cold
feet before a wedding.
The lyrics are hilarious,
but Bailey’s performance
truly elevates the song.
However, it is worth
noting that, at times, the
number relies heavily on
gimmicks, which make
the number even funnier,
but rather distracting.
Rosalie Craig makes
a great Bobbie, whose
subtle performance makes
it clear that the show isn’t
about Bobbie, but about
love and life through her
eyes. She is relatable,
and not for one second
does she seem greedy or
unsatisfied.
The overall cast is also
great. Mel Giedroyc and
Gavin Spokes, who have
amazing comedic timing
and brilliant chemistry,
carry the roles of Sarah
and Harry perfectly.
The play is directed
skilfully by Marianne
Elliott (Angels in America,
War Horse, The Curious
Incident of the Dog in the
Night-Time), who trans-
forms the play from being
simply through Bobbie’s
eyes, to being in her mind
as she explores, examines
and compares her current
life to what could be if she
was married.
One particular scene is
worth mentioning here; a
written yesterday.
The staging matches
the colourful posters that
adorn all of the walls, with
moving giant set pieces
forming rooms for the
action to take place. They
also make way for some
visual illusionism with
clear Alice In Wonder-
land references, driving
home the point that it’s
all, in fact, in Bobbie’s
head. Speaking of which,
Bobbie clearly stands out
in her red dress, reinforc-
ing how different she is,
and how different she
feels from all her friends.
Her married friends.
In summary, Company
not only matches the
expectations, but,w for
the most part, massively
exceeds them. It is both
entertaining and heart
breaking, with music to
die for. Pretty darn close
to being perfect, Company
promises to be a wonder-
ful trip to the theatre.
