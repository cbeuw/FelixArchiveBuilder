The Trolley Problem: What Would You Choose?
Would you kill one person to save five people? With the increasing popularity of self-driving cars, the famous
‘trolley problem’ has turned from a philosophical riddle into a real issue awaiting a solution.

group have surveyed over
2 million citizens from
over 200 countries about
morally difficult deci-
sions that autonomous
vehicles might have to
make. Participants played
‘Moral Machine’, an
online game designed by
the researchers. In a series
of potential situations on
the road (mostly sudden
break failures), they had
to choose the lesser of two
evils: for example, if it is
morally more acceptable
to kill a man in the car
or a woman with a child
crossing the street.
As well as about 40
million recorded choices,
scientists gathered a lot
of demographic data
such as the age, gender,
or education level of the
participants. However,
the only patterns in moral
decision making they
found were geographical
and cultural. For example,
citizens of “eastern”
countries (a term defined
by the researchers, refer-
ring broadly to Asia) were
less likely to save young
people over the elderly
than participants from
elsewhere.
“The most emphatic
global preferences in the
survey are for sparing the
lives of humans over the
norms in an emergency.
Moreover, public en-
gagement is the key to
building up the public’s
trust in the new technolo-
gy – a necessary condition
to adopt autonomous
vehicles on a large scale.
So far “public interest in
the platform surpassed
our wildest expectations,”

Store Glacier: storing water?
Recent research from Stanford University has shed light on a phenomenon: liquid water stored in pockets within
solid ice. This discovery has important implications for predicting sea level rises under climate change – rises that
will impact the lives of billions of people.

y now, many
of us are aware
of the 5th
Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change
(IPCC) report, which
has attracted a storm of
media attention since its
publication last month.
The report considers the
environmental conse-
quences of many possible
climatic scenarios. These
consequences include
global warming-induced
sea level rises, a product
of the thermal expansion
of sea water and melting
land-ice running into the
seas. However, there is
much discourse over the
extent and rate of future
rises, partly due to insuf-
ficient knowledge of the
mechanisms underlying
melting land-ice. Recent
research from Stanford
University provides
insight into a possible
complexity with land-ice
melting: the phenomenon
of liquid water trapped
within glaciers. This
more accurately predict
how melting land-ice will
impact our planet.
The researchers from
Stanford used ice-pene-
trating radar to identify
density variations within
the Store Glacier in West
Greenland. Regions of
higher density indicated
trapped water, and higher
density regions correlated
with glacial areas that had
recently been melting.
From this correlation, the
researchers inferred that
meltwater had trickled
into, and become trapped
within fractures in the ice.
Meltwater is known to
impact glacial movement
by flowing to the base
where it contributes to
basal lubrication and a
subsequent increase in
glacial sliding. The si-
phoning-off of meltwater
into pockets within the ice
may modify this process,
by either delaying or
entirely preventing the
meltwater from reaching
thebase.Howtheicemelts
and where the meltwater
flows will contribute to
how a glacier responds to
future climatic conditions,
which will impact the pre-
dicted timeline for future
sea level rises.
Previous research
has focused on surface
changes to glacial land-
scapes, whilst the Stanford
study offers insight into
more diverse glacial melt
mechanisms. With around
40% of the global human
population living within
100km of coasts, the need
for accurate sea level pre-
dictions has never been
greater. The Stanford
study demonstrates that a
more in-depth approach
to studying and modelling
land-ice melting will be
required for climate sci-
entists to make better pre-
dictions of future sea level
rises, and help us prepare
for what the future brings.
