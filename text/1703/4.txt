College declares support for increased pension
contributions to settle long-running dispute

Imperial's response
to a pensions
consultation says the
College is prepared
to pay more into staff
pensions

I
mperial has stated
it is willing to in-
crease its pension
contributions as
a consultation over a
long-running dispute
closes.
Proposed changes to
the University Superan-
nuation Scheme (USS)
– the pension plan to
which most lecturers in
the UK belong – sparked
strikes earlier this year.
The suggested move
would have linked the
value of pensions to the
performance of the stock
market. Analysis suggest-
ed that the move could
cost members up to 60%
of their pension value.
Following an agreement
between the University
and College Union (UCU)
and Universities UK
(UUK) a panel was set
up to review the valuation
process that incorrectly
judged the USS to have a
£7.5 million deficit.
Released last month,
the report of the Joint
Expert Panel (JEP) set
out five adjustments to be
considered in future valu-
ations. Chief among these
is a “fuller consideration
of the employers’ ability
and willingness to bear
risk”.
Responding to a
consultation on the
JEP’s findings, a College
statement said: “The
College is supportive of
retaining the current...
USS if this is sustainable
from a financial and
regulatory perspective.
We are willing to increase
our employer contri-
butions...to support the
scheme.”
Last November, the
then-provost Professor
James Stirling said the
planned changes were
“necessary” as the USS
was “not likely to be
sustainable”. UCU repre-
sentatives told Felix at the
time that the College had
acknowledged it could
afford to continue with
the USS but had chosen
not to.
According to one UCU
member, the reaction
to the report has been
“broadly positive”.
“We’ve said all along
the valuation is flawed and
finally someone is agree-
ing with us,” they said.
However, they added:
“The only snag is making
sure the recommendations
Any suggestions that
Imperial cannot afford to
support its staff border on
risible given the College’s
spending habits.
Continuing with the
current USS plan would
cost Imperial no more
than 10% of its operating
surplus, which 2016-17
figures put at almost
£120 million. In the year
prior, the College paid
£80 million into pensions
funds. Its profit over the
same period was £78
million.
Since then, staff
expenditure (i.e. the
amount spent on salaries
and pensions) has fallen
from 55% to 53% of
total expenditure. Failure
to keep up with the rate
of inflation has seen the
average salary at Imperial
fall 1.1% each year since
2005 and London living
costs have risen twice as
quickly as pay. Senior
staff however are the most
highly paid of any Russell
Group university, averag-
ing salaries of £280,000
each.
Imperial is rapidly
expanding its property
portfolio (already one of
the largest in London)
and the College’s fixed
assets total more than £1.5
billion. Other investments
include £3.5 million in
the tobacco industry, £9
million in fossil fuels,
£3.1 million in the arms
industry, and £16 million
in pharmaceuticals.
The College also ben-
efits from controversial
donors such as the Sackler
Trust – linked to the US
opioid crisis – and the
Atomic Weapons Estab-
lishment.
Imperial has withheld
at least £280,000 from
striking staff. Deductions
across all Russell Group
universities totaled over
10 million. More than
5,000 students, represent-
ed by legal firm Asserson,
joined a class action
lawsuit calling for partial
tuition fee refunds as
compensation for missed
teaching time. Over 3,000
Imperial students signed a
petition to the same effect.
The UCU estimates that
students missed almost
600,000 hours of teaching.
While many universities
ringfenced the withheld
money for student support
services or hardship funds,
Imperial is diverting the
money to the departments
of those involved in the
strikes. There have been
no guarantees that this
will be used to benefit
students.

“The College

from a

regulatory
perspective”
of the JEP are implement-
ed, which is not guaran-
teed at present.”
Last week, the Finan-
cial Times reported that 39
finance experts had urged
the USS to reject the JEP’s
proposals or face “perni-
cious consequences”. The
JEP defended its recom-
mendations, saying they
were “practical and reflect
the unique, underlying
strength and longevity of
the USS”.
“Any
suggestions
that Imperial
cannot afford
to support its
staff border
on risible
given College's
spending
habits”
Analysis: How will
the future of the USS
be funded?
