The State of the Union
Editor-in-Chief, Andy Djaba, gives his take on the state of the Union and the problematic
culture at Imperial
COMMENT
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
A
few weeks ago,
I wrote a News
article about
a concerning
image that emerged
showing Jarlath O’Hara,
the Managing Director of
Imperial College London,
pictured beside a man
dressed in blackface. I was
first made aware of the
image on 27th
September
If I’m honest, my initial
reaction to the picture
was to laugh. Not because
I found anything par-
ticularly funny or didn’t
appreciate the seriousness
of the situation but be-
cause, unfortunately, this
sort of problematic be-
haviour from people that
should know better has
become all too prevalant a
feature in our daily lives. I
often feel so helpless that
all I can do is laugh. I was
present at the 5th
October
meeting between Jarlath,
Rob Tomkies, the Union
President, and concerned
students who had seen
the image; six of whom
are BME students. At this
meeting, Jarlath was re-
peatedly urged by almost
everyone present to extend
the apology made to
those present to the wider
student body through the
release of a public state-
ment/ acknowledgement.
However, Jarlath declined
to do so and, subsequently,
there was a general air of
dissatisfaction following
the meeting.
I have no qualms with
Jarlath’s refusal to issue
a public apology; he is
well within his rights to
deal with the situation
as he sees fit. However,
I thought the official
response of the Union
and the Board of Trustees
to the emergence of the
image was particularly
interesting. Jill Finney,
the Head of the Board
of Trustees, began her
statement on behalf of
the Board of Trustees by
saying: “It is deeply unfor-
tunate that Jarlath found
himself photographed in
these circumstances over
12 years ago. Compro-
mising historical images
are increasingly a feature
of our daily lives and it
is incumbent upon all of
us to ensure we do not
participate or fall victim
to them.”
I would argue that this
response was inadequate
and even bordered on tone
deaf. I think it’s particu-
larly telling that Jarlath is
being painted as a victim
in this situation. Although
it is an unfortunate situa-
tion that Jarlath has found
himself in and it could be
argued that there is a con-
versation to be had about
compromising historical
images, this should not
be the Union’s primary
focus. It screams to me
that the Union is missing
the point.
However, I can’t say
I’m surprised. From my
experience, the Union
often misses the point. My
opinionsoftheUnionhave
primarily been formed
by the four years I spent
here as an undergraduate
student, as opposed to the
few months I’ve spent as
an employee of the Union.
Although I would say my
opinions are changing,
I’ve generally had a quite
negative view of the
Union, especially when
it comes to issues of ine-
quality and, in particular,
race.
The statement from
the Board of Trustees
ended with, “the Board...
have satisfied themselves
that Jarlath has no racist
intent whatsoever”. I’m
actually keen to move the
conversation away from
Jarlath because I feel that,
when discussing issues of
race, too much energy is
focused on the individuals
involved rather than the
wider issue at hand. This is
what I feel the Union has
done with their response
here and it should be
noted that the Union is
not in the best position
to judge “racist intent”.
Racism is not binary. As
we have seen here, having
“no racist intent” and even
committing yourself to
equality does not preclude
you from being part of or
being complicit in a racist
act.
In the past, College and
the Union have benefited
from having a somewhat
apolitical student body
and, as a result, problem-
atic behaviour seems to
repeatedly go unchecked
or is excused away as
being“tradition.”Whether
it be the Rugby team’s
“fiesta dash” fiasco, the
fact that, as recently as
2016, the Royal School of
Mines held fresher “slave
auctions” or the fact that
“The 15s”, the Women’s
Tie Club, is so-called
because it was founded
in 2015 (in contrast, “The
22s”, a male Tie Club, was
founded in 1922), there
are far too many examples
from recent memory of
times at which the Union
has aligned itself with
frankly unacceptable be-
haviour. I think it is telling
that, following the public
fallout from the “fiesta
dash” event, ICURFC
felt aggrieved enough
to appeal the ensuing
punishment. It says to me
that they felt somehow
“hard done by” and that
this punishment was too
harsh. I’m not suggesting
that the punishment was
too lenient but, if I were
them, I would be counting
my lucky stars that the
punishment wasn’t more
severe. That, and the fact
that so little of the conver-
sation was geared towards
the racist aspect of the
incident, is indicative of
a culture of acceptance
of problematic behaviour
that is festering in the
Union.
However, it’s not all
doom and gloom! College
and the Union are launch-
ing multiple initiatives to
tackle the problems with
the culture at Imperial,
including the Race
Equality Charter and the
Equality, Diversity and
Inclusion Act. However
these initiatives require
difficult and often uncom-
fortable conversations
and open discourse about
inequality and attitudes
at Imperial. With Black
History Month drawing
to a close, now is as good
a time as ever to have
these conversations and
to address exactly why
so many BME Imperial
students feel disillusioned
and disenfranchised with
the Union.
In the next phase of
the Union’s development
we have to consider the
future. Otherwise the
Union runs the risk of per-
petuating a culture of in-
differnce which is counter
productive to their ideals
of inclusivity.
