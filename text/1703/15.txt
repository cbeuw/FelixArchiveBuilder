Kingdom Hearts 3: A Hands On Review
GAMES

T
his 16-year-old
franchise has a
special place in
many gamers’
hearts for a variety of
reasons. Some, for how
convoluted the story has
become from the original
Kingdom Hearts, but
many­have come to love
the franchise due to the
crossover between the
Final Fantasy and Disney
characters, and how they
interact with the original
characters and settings
within the world of
Kingdom Hearts.
Now, on the topic of
Disney films, who doesn’t
love a good Disney film?
From the films that you’ve
watched growing up, to
the films that you still
watch now, each film has
a special place in every-
one’s heart. There’s just
something special about
the Corporate mouse.
And that’s why so many
of us have been excited
about the new franchises
that we will get to visit in
Kingdom Hearts 3 which
includes Toy Story, Big
Hero 6, Monsters Inc. and
Frozen.
I managed to get
some hands-on time with
Kingdom Hearts 3’s Toy
Box world at the MCM
London Comic Con last
weekend, and here are my
thoughts.
We are opened to the
story of the Toy Box
world with Woody and
Buzz fretting over the
disappearance of the other
toys and humans, includ-
ing Andy, by mysterious
creatures who have been
popping up in their world.
Hello Heartless, it’s time
to be slain (again). Enter
Sora, Donald and Goofy
(those names can only be
said in this order, don’t
believe me? Then play
through any game in
the franchise and keep a
counter). Our loveable
protagonists have been
transformed into toys
and are hunting down the
organisation and doing
their usual job of freeing
hearts.
Upon being thrust into
this world, it’s immediate-
ly apparent the developers
have fully recreated the
look and feel of the Toy
After the Toy Story
gang get acquainted with
Sora, Donald and Goofy,
we set off to explore why
everyone has disappeared.
Gameplay and
Mechanics
The core aspect of
the combat of Kingdom
Hearts 3 is still relatively
the same as the other
titles in the series. We still
have Sora mixing strong
and fast melee Keyblade
combos as well as using
his magic abilities such as
Blizzard and Fira.
An interesting
mechanic which has been
introduced is that you
can now swap between
three keyblades whilst in
combat without having
to go into the menu.
With real-time weapon
switching, the range of
combat options available
to you has been expanded
immensely.
Introduced in Birth
by Sleep, we see the
Shotlock mechanic return.
The Shotlock feature has
two options, one is the
familiar magical blasts
and the other option is to
Shotlock into a flow-mo-
tion attack (flow-motion
was introduced in Dream
Drop Distance). Now
back on to the point of
keyblade switching; with
the ability to change
keyblades in real time,
you have the option to
change your Shotlock
command depending on
the keyblade.
There are new trans-
formations introduced in
this game which change
the way Sora moves and
fights within the game.
The different keyblades
have unique transforma-
tions which were explored
in the Toy Box demo. The
Toy Story keyblade trans-
forms into yo-yos and can
summon tea cups to attack
the heartless with. The
Monsters Inc. keyblade
could transform into
claws for a range of melee
attacks and the Tangled
keyblade offered a range
of magic-based attacks.
The key to drawing out
these transformations
was to build up a meter
above the actions menu.
You build up energy quite
quickly, so feel free to
spam your special moves.
In the final section of
the demo, Sora hops into
a toy mech and battles
other mechs. With a first
person camera angle, you
feel as if you’re in control
of an actual mech. This
section was amazing just
because of how different
it was.
Kingdom Hearts 3 is
looking to be an amazing
game so far.
It will be released
on the PS4 and Xbox
One, apparently on 29th
January 2019 (let’s hope
that there’s no last minute
changes/delays).
