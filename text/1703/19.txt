ark pools. The
words invoke
an atmosphere
of secrecy and
evil, harkening back to
myths of murky waters
and ancient terrors that
lurk within. Throw in
the modern element of
trading and most im-
agine clandestine deals
involving dubious char-
acters straight out of The
Godfather. The reality is
less intimidating.
Dark pools refer
to non-public stock
trading platforms where
shares can be traded
anonymously, in which
details of the transaction
and parties involved are
not made public. They are
only accessible to large
institutional investors
transacting large volumes
of shares, allowing both
parties to deal at desirable
prices. To understand dark
pools better, it is important
to understand how the
modern stock exchange
functions.
From bustling coffee
shops in the 17th
century,
where merchants and
brokers haggled, the
modern stock exchange
has not veered from its
main function: matching
buyers and sellers.
Companies listed on the
stock exchange have
shares being bought and
sold regularly. Buyers
and sellers submit orders
through a broker and an
electronic system matches
orders to complete the
transaction. Whilst
stock exchanges have
a minimum order size,
known as a lot size,
the sheer volume and
breadth of participants
from large hedge funds
to individual investors
create a spectrum of order
sizes: from eye-watering
investors. Therefore,
public knowledge of large
transactions can influence
the share price of the
companies involved as the
wider market scrambles
to profit alongside the
institutions.
For instance, Fund B
decides to sell 1,000,000
shares in Company A at
$100.00/share on a regular
stock exchange. The
sell order is submitted,
and the exchange begins
to break down the sale
into smaller chunks and
find matching buyers.
Traders and other market
participants will notice an
increase of sell orders for
Company A, arriving at
the logical conclusion that
the ‘smart money’ have
either; decided to take
profit at the current share
price or have knowledge
of negative developments
and are anticipating a
drop. They would proceed
to sell the stock as well,
placing ‘pressure’ on the
share price and causing
it to drop further. This
creates a ripple effect, as
more market participants
get wind of price
movements and join in
the selling. This effect,
combined with the large
order being broken down,
results in orders being
filled at ever decreasing
prices, resulting in a lower
net price for the entire
order of 1,000,000 shares.
If Fund B gets an average
sale price of $95.00, 5%
lower than intended,
it represents a loss of
$5,000,000 in potential
profits. The effect would
be similar for a Fund C
buying 1,000,000 shares
at $100.00/share, as
buying pressure drives up
share prices, resulting in a
higher net price. Here is
where a dark pool comes
in handy for Funds B and
C.
In the dark pool,
the electronic system
matches buyers to sellers
anonymously just like a
stock exchange. However,
orders are secret, as
participants do not know
the price and size of
transactions happening
within. Crucially for
public funds, knowledge
of the transaction will
only be released after
the deal has happened,
ensuring the ripple
effect from the wider
market will not affect
the transaction. If two
non-public companies,
such as private equity
firms, are involved in the
transactions the wider
market may never hear
of the deal as they are
not required to announce
it. Trading fees in dark
pools are also cheaper
than exchanges. It is
important to note: dark
pools are not illegal, their
operators are registered
and regulated by financial
authorities like a regular
stock exchange. Dark
pools were initially used
by brokerages to ease
the processing of large
orders and have grown in
popularitysincethe1980s.
Operators include banks
such as Credit Suisse,
Goldman Sachs, Citi,
and Morgan Stanley and
independent brokerages
like ITG and LiquidNet.
Even the London Stock
Exchange operates dark
pools: Cboe Europe and
Turquoise Plato.
Due to the large orders,
exchanges are concerned
about the volume of
trading being drawn away
from regular exchanges,
resulting in lesser fees
for exchanges and lower
activity for the wider
market. According to
Thomson Reuters, over
45% of daily traded
volume in Europe occurs
in off-exchange platforms
like dark pools. With
secretive deals the public
is deprived of knowledge
and are less empowered to
makeinformedinvestment
decisions, which breaks
down the trust of public
investors. Subject to less
reliable prices and lower
liquidity, it seems unfair
for institutional investors
to profit from a separate
platform at the expense of
the public.
The days of dark
pool trading may be
at an end with the
introduction of the Mifid
II (Markets in financial
instruments derivative)
regulations by the EU
in early 2018. Meant to
bring transparency and
efficiency back to the
European markets, this
regulation seeks to drain
Europe’s dark pools and
force transactions back
into the light. Under Mifid
II, dark pools face a twin
cap on the amount of
trading that can be done.
Just 4% of the total trading
millions to the lowly tens.
It is hard to match orders
of the same size and it
becomes near impossible
as the order size increases.
Large orders are broken
down into smaller chunks
to be matched to sellers,
and this happens over
days.
For example, a seller
submits a sell order of
10,000 shares in Company
A. Should there not be a
concurrent buy order for
10,000 shares of Company
A, but instead ten buy
orders to buy 1,000 shares
each, the larger sell order
will be broken down into
ten blocks of 1,000 shares.
An important
distinction with a
stock exchange is price
transparency; the total
volume of shares in buy
and sell orders are made
public along with the bid
and ask price (i.e. the
highest price the buyers
are buying or ‘bidding’
for a share and the lowest
price the sellers are selling
or ‘asking’ for a share are
visible)
Price transparency
can undermine the
profitability of large deals.
Participants dealing in
large volumes of shares
are often institutional
investors, whose dealings
are closely monitored as
an indication of ‘smart
money’ movement. It
is assumed the people
helming these institutions
possess deep knowledge
of businesses and
valuable insights about
future potential, giving
them an edge over smaller
Dark Pools: Evil place or a market place?
in any stock is allowed
in a dark pool over a
twelve month period.
Simultaneously the
trading of an individual
stock across all dark pools
is limited to 8% of the
total volume in that stock.
According to the Financial
Times, upticks in the
market share of some
exchanges were noted in
the week following the
implementation of Mifid
II.
However, as with any
new rule, firms have
found ways around
them. An alternative less
regulated trading platform
sharing numerous features
with dark pools, known as
systematic internalisers
(SI), are gaining
popularity. Some 24
institutions have already
adopted a SI status,
including prominent
banks, proprietary trading
firms and market makers
like Tower Research
Capital, Citadel Securities
and Virtu Financial.
While policy makers in
the EU have made clear
their desire to clamp down
on dark pools, there is no
intention to eliminate
them, accepting the need
for institutions to transact
without shifting the
market price. There are
exceptions for unlimited
trading in dark pools for
large orders. SIs with
cheaper fees and lower
standards for quote sizes
and trade reporting will
fill gaps not big enough to
match the EU’s large order
exemption rule, but large
enough to affect market
prices. With the UK set
to leave the EU the matter
of Mifid’s enforcement
arises. Policy makers have
jumped into the deep end
of regulating dark pools.
