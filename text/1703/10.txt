Pieces of a Man is introspective, indulgent, and
inaccessible
Despite lavish production, the latest effort by Mick Jenkins never really gets off the ground. Loosely narrating the
fragments and facets of a person’s life, Jenkins’ jigsaw seems to be missing a piece.
T
wo years after
his ambitious
but inconsistent
and occasion-
ally preachy release The
Healing Component,
Mick Jenkins has dropped
a new album, Pieces of a
Man. Four singles were
released prior to the al-
bum’s unveiling, but the
best two of these were
inexplicably not included
on it. This is frustrating,
as these (‘Bruce Banner’,
‘What Am I To Do’) are
far more compelling than
any song that actually
made the cut.
Mick is known for
intricate wordplay and
smooth, jazzy production,
which Pieces of a Man
has in spades, along
with a more organic and
laid-back sonic palette
than found on any of his
previous work. However,
what is missing from this
album, which was an
important component of
what made his previous
works great, is compel-
ling song structures and
catchy, memorable hooks.
What is presented on this
new album is a set of
fourteen tracks (and three
supposedly profound skits
that seem unfocused and
fail to combine into a
coherent message), which
are, compared to his
previous effort, extremely
linear and uneventful.
Thirty seconds into most
songs, you will have heard
everything the instrumen-
tal is going to do; there
are no interesting beat
switches or compelling
choruses.
“53 minutes of
songs that all
have the same
tone really
drag”
“It really can’t
be overstated
just how linear
and repetitive
these songs
are”
This is the primary
issue with Pieces, and the
reason it feels even longer
than its 53 minute run-
time: a lack of compelling
song structure. Mick still
brings incredibly precise,
honed flows and smart
lyricism, but the songs
boreyou.Halfwaythrough
the album I felt exhausted
and in desperate need of
a standout moment that,
sadly, never came. This
is in stark contrast to his
last album, where songs
like ‘Drowning’ and ‘The
Healing Component’
featured layered and
climactic structures, and
gave the album a sense
of unpredictability and
variety.
Whilst his previous
album had a few bad
songs, which Pieces
avoids by having a con-
sistent quality, its highs
outstripped anything
offered here. There are no
standouts. ‘Plain Clothes’
offers a change of pace
from the linear beats as
Mick swaps his rapping
for soulful singing, but it
is nowhere near as good
as his best sung tracks
(see: ‘Drowning’, ‘Spread
Love’).
Adding to the tedium
created by a lack of
choruses or beat switch-
ups, every rapped song
adopts a very similar
tone and tempo. Unlike
on his breakout mixtape
The Water[s], which
had tracks where Mick
spanned various emotions
and levels of intensity,
here every song adopts a
laid back, quietly bragga-
docious style, as if he has
nothing to prove. Whilst
this fits the smooth jazz
rap production and makes
thisalbumrelaxingtohave
on in the background, 53
minutes of songs that all
have the same tone really
drag if you’re paying
attention.
Perhaps most dis-
appointing of all is the
lack of interesting topics
and motifs. It’s hinted
at occasionally that the
central theme is that you
only ever see pieces of a
person (which is intuitive
him), b) how he brings the
truth, or c) how hard he
works on his writing. But
in no song does this hard
work and truth-bringing
seem evident; despite his
brags about educating
us, I can find no solid or
profound messages in any
of these songs. This is in
stark contrast to his last
album, where songs like
‘Spread Love’ delivered a
sincere and brave message
(sentimentality not being
something you often find
in modern hip-hop), or
‘What Am I To Do’, a
single released before this
album which addressed
police brutality and is far
more hard-hitting and
thought-provoking than
any song that was actually
included here.
It really can’t be over-
stated just how linear and
repetitive these songs are,
and how the complete
lack of standout moments
makes the album feel
this isn’t what I look for
from Mick. I want songs
that make me stop and
think, interesting and
left-field production,
and choruses that I can
sing in the shower. The
Healing Component was
a slight step down from
The Water[s], but still
contained some excellent
tracks, whereas there
isn’t a single cut on this
album that could stand
shoulder-to-shoulder
with Mick’s best. Whilst
undeniably well produced
and performed, the lack
of a coherent theme,
engaging song topics or
catchy melodies leaves
the album feeling hollow
and ultimately forgettable.
