This week's Felix is not thicc
T
oday marks the
first day in my
run as Editor that
I've managed to
get this part written on
time - only because this
week's edition was com-
piled on a Wednesday. A
bit early, I know, but it was
either this or some of you
went without your weekly
crosswords (and all the
other high quality articles
we write over here).
Now some of you
might be wondering - why
is this edition of Felix a
bit light? A wise man once
said, "size doesn't matter".
Sometimes the best things
in life come in small
packages.
As I'm writing this,
Halloween ACC rages
on upstairs. Surprisingly
not as rowdy as I was
expecting. Not that I'm
complaining, though if
there were a massive fight
that'd give me one more
article to fill up this issue.
Halloween is a good
point to look back at how
settled into the new year
we are. Personally I'm not
for the whole thing, but I
can respect the time and
effort people take into
fashioning each costume.
So far in these six
issues I've overseen as
Editor, I've taken a com-
pletely new perspective of
the Union than I had as a
student. It's a bit mad - it
goes from being that place
you go to after your last
exam or when your room
booking falls through to
this whole almost-polit-
ical system you have to
navigate. In light of the
many different articles
I've had to write on it

Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
(since I do get paid to do
this), I thought it'd be wise
to give my hot take on its
general direction.
I must admit, it's a bit
nice to get away from
writing about facts for
once and just giving my
opinion this week - you'd
think being a newspaper
editor, you'd get to fill
32 pages with whatever
you're thinking: not the
case unfortunately (bear
this in mind if any of you
are thinking of running for
Felix Editor in the future).
Even more exciting is
gearing up to write for
my old section once again
(Music fztw); keep a look
out for that in next week's
edition.
I can't end this without
thanking my incredible
Felix team: every single
one of the contributors
who've helped get this
paper out even with one
day less to work with
- can't say that I ever ap-
proached my degree with
this level of dedication but
I'm glad you're here to help
out! This week the paper
is shorter and is being sent
to print on a Wednesday
because tomorrow I will
be at my friend Lauren's
funeral. The support from
everyone around me in
this tough time has been
touching and overwhelm-
ing and I can't thank you
all enough.
