Last Tuesday, "Shadow of Heroes"
opened at the Piccadilly Theatre, star-
ring Peggy Aahoroft and Emlyn Williams:
the plot deals with events leading up
to the 1956 Rebellion in Hungary.
Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's
Journey into Night" at the Globe i s
a largely autobiographical study of his
l i f e ' s troubles condensed into one day,
and i n that day drugs and aloohol have
a devastating effect on morality.
Opening at the Theatre Royal,
Stratford, E., on October 14th i s "The
Hostage"; the long-simmering trouble
of the IRA i s brought to the boil
when an English soldier and an IRA
man are held as hostages by the oppoaitt
sides.
Miss Bardot's fans w i l l be pleased
to hear that she has done i t again:
in "Love i s My Profession" at the Cameo-
Royal, she manages to spend more time i n
bed than ever before, ably supported
with some good acting by Jean Gob in.
An informal "get-together" of a l l
I.C. folk,who went to Sweden and Finland
w i l l be held i n room 120 N.H. at 7.30
p.m. on October 15th. Please l e t me
know i f you oan come.

SEEING RED
Dear Sir,
I write on behalf of of the Com-
mittee of the Literary & Debating Soc-
iety and I wish to ask questions about
the status of the Marxist Literary Group.
For some years i t has been a sub-group
of this Sooiety and, along with the
Christmas Islanders, i t happens to have
received no grant for this session.
It would appear that the powers-
that-be of this oollege prefer to be
hypocritical. They say:"we mist not
recognise that there are Communists in
oollege; the Governors would not like
that. But we will give them some
money on the quiet; let them be a
Marxist Literary Group and let them
suokle the breasts of the Literary *
Debating Society!"
These Communists have been active
as a political body and have seldom as-
pired to literature. Why not recognise
them for what they are: a Communist
Sooiety, or make them at least a sub-
group of a political sooiety. Let us
be honest for once i n a while, or else
let us comfort our consciences by a
l i t t l e honesty about our hypocrisy and
let us create the 'Marxist Tiddlewink
Group'as a sub-group of the Table-
Tennis Club. Then everyone would know
that we are being ridiculous instead of
having to guess.
Yours sincerely,
Peter Jarman.

There once was a fieldmouse called Alfred. His particular field was Organic
Chemistry and his Ph.D. thesis on the subjeot was published i n three volumes and
universally acknowledged as a masterpiece. But he was very lonely, isolated as
he was i n his aoademio eminence. His family oouldn't understand him and his
wife nagged him so that he left home and went to live i n College. At last, he
f e l t so much i n need of companionship and comfort that he decided to syntheslse
an "understanding fieldmouse,female".
So he worked out the relevant formulae and built an enormous apparatus (for
which he obtained a grant from the D.S.I.R.). Unfortunately he made a slight
mistake i n the arithmetic, and synthesised a bloody great oat, whioh ate him.
