The party, comprising seven I.C.
students and tiro members of the staff,
arrived i n Reykjavik, the capital, on
the 26th June. Moat of tha party
then proceeded to take the bus for the
45O Kms to Akureyi, situated on the
north ooast of the island,while the
sixteen packing oases, accompanied by
one member of the party and two very
pretty Icelandic girls, followed by
lorry late on the Saturday evening.
Base camp was established at Reydarf-
jordur, and after a coffee party with
a local fisherman, surveying began a
few days later. Meanwhile, the two
geologists followed i n a van, and after
a somewhat incredible Journey, during
whicL time they lost much of their k i t
along a hundred mile stretch of road
(fortunately later returned to the
Akureyi Police by a following driver),
eventually arrived nearly two weeks after
the establishment of Base camp, having
enjoyed themselves immensely!
The expedition now split up for the
serious work of the expedition, the geo-
logists going south to start their map-
ping, one surveying party moving to a
more northerly fjord to do a survey of
the raised beaches and make some tidal
observations, while the second survey
party stayed at Base to undertake sim-
i l a r work.
Transport and communication i n this
rugged fjord oountry proved difficult
between the parties, resulting in three
surveyors making a baokbreeking trek
carrying 60 lbs of equipment each, for
over two weeks.
Early i n August, five of the
party took a coastal boat south, to-
wards the glaciers and ioe sheets,
with the intention of doing a survey of
a »i»»n ice cap. Ten vary cold days
were subsequently spent (on an exposed
rocky ledge) close to the edge of the
ioe, during whioh time the party waa
tent bound for 5 days due to mist,
rain, snow and sleet. Owing to the
mist, much compass treking was necessary,
a tricky business when the rooks of
the area affect the stability of the
ooapasB, The weather finally did i t s
worst, when a tent surrendered to the
wind, rewarding i t s occupants with some
four gallons of icy oold water.
In contrast to this, the last few
days of our stay, when the fishing
dispute was i n f u l l swing, was spent
in the excellent hospitality of our
hosts, whioh was so characteristic of
the inhabitants of this windswept
"Bastion of the North".

Are most students, especially Fre-
shers, aware of the character of the
three Carnivals run during the course
of the year by the constituent college
unions? Briefly, these affairs"are
marked by exhibitions of drunkeness
and pornography to such a degree that
would lead, were they to take place in
a night-club or place of public enter-
tainment, to instant closure and prose-
cution by the police. The decor adop- ,
ted at every Carnival has one theme
only, i l l i c i t sex, and each of the three
bodies responsible for organising these
so-called revels seems to attempt to
outdo i t s rivals i n the exhibition of
ever smuttier cartoons.
Cabarets demand a section to them-
selves, consisting of a succession of
dreary, unmusical, untalented ani gross-
ly under-rehearsed sketches, oft—i
proceeded by mass singing of a ty. e
usually confined to the Offioera' *"oss
or the pavillions of the more obscure
rugby clubs after the 4th XV's only home
win of the season. The rise of the
curtain i s accompanied by derisive
shouts and often bottles, glasses and
food from the sub-nutritive buffet are
hurled at the performers: were only
the performers hit, nothing would be
amiss, but the stage and the proscen-
ium arch are sometimes damaged.

I.C.W.A. Guide to the Autuan Trends
For the guidance of newcomers and
oldstagers who wish to keep up with the
times, FELIX has asked his fashion
correspondent to report on what the
well-dressed man-about-I.C. w i l l be
wearing *his session.
In probable anticipation, of a
cold winter, face-covers have become
fashion news this year. Several new
styles have been brought bank from the
continent, some small and pointed, others
close-fitting and curly. With careful
trimming these leave the eyes quite free
and allow f u l l movement to the nose.
They usually come i n brown or black but
a pale straw colour which was popular
last year does not seem to be so much
in vogue this season.
Hair has been worn short during the
summer but with the decrease i n temper-
ature and funds I can confidently fore-
oast that i t w i l l grow. This new
longer style may be difficult to manage
but i f you follow our Special Easy 3-
Minute Beauty Plan (apply box 3907
enclosing 5/- Postal Order) you w i l l
see a new, exciting lustre i n your easy-
to-manage hair you have never noticed
before.
The very latest thing in Presidents
now i s the short, wide look. The de-
crease in length i s of course more than
balanced by an emphasis on quality of
material but to carry off this new line
you must take especial care to develop
the piercing eye. Everyone will love
this new, oh-so-ohubby, fashion.
Surprisingly, women are brought to
these Carnivals but,to my knowledge,
seldom does a g i r l return a second time.
They are not the kind of evening's
entertainment to which anyone would
bring his sister. It i s evident that
the sole reason for taking a partner is
the hope that, i n the atmosphere of
immorality with which she i s surrounded
she may be contaminated and thus i n -
duced, with the assistance of gin, to
behave i n a degraded fashion.
That the Union should tolerate such
exhibitions, with the resultant dam-
age to property and morals that ensues,
is surprising.

CLUB DANCES
Would the Secretaries of Clubs
who wish to run a Saturday night inform-
al dance please make their applications
to the Entertainments Committee as soon
as possible, with the date preferred.
Glasses are definitely OUT this
session.
A oonfident forecast of what YOU
will be wearing i n the cooler days ahead
is the "ohio-sao sweater". Waists
will be lower than ever but the arms
are usually cunningly hung from the
shoulders and draped casually Into the
trouser pockets. An interesting det-
a i l i s the cutest l i t t l e fray-fringe
whioh often makes its appearance about
knee level. With this ensemble you will
want to wear a rainbow-gay shirt which
for spiok-and-span grooming absolutely
must be changed every week. To top
off this cosy-bright winter outfit, a
snug flannel scarf worn right up to the
eyes i s an old favourite, s t i l l firmly
in vogue.
Finally some up-to-the-minute news
from special correspondent Gamett. -
A must for you, our younger readers this
session is the pale, cleansed, fresh
look. This can only be attained by
infinite care but YOU are the only ones
who can wear i t , and i t is oh-so-worth-
while.
