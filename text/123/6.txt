ROUND & ABOUT
by Romulus
Towards the end of each term many
I.C. men approach lowarians with a plea
for help. However last Sunday Miss I.
Piokinson voiced the opinion of I.C.W.A.
by issuing an early ultimatum, " I f they
want their socks darned, they must learn -
to do i t themselves!"
Talking of holes reminds me of the
cavity whioh has recently appeared i n
a wall near to the serving hatch i n
the .Lower Refectory. Soon the alter-
ation w i l l be completed and a new door
fitted, but be careful ' a l l ye that enter
there-in" for i t only leads to the
washing-up room! At last something
has been done to speed up the removal
of dirty crockery.
When not playing his violin Mr.
McDowell i s to be found i n his office
at the top of the Registry busily ar-
ranging the oollege 'General Studies'.
Last Thursday lunch-time he started off
the term with a bang. The two lectures
(sex and crime) were wall attended (No
comment). Sir Roderio H i l l started
General Studies i n 1952, and he appointed
Mr. McDowell as organiser who has ad-
mirably held the reins ever since. Be
is a t a l l , quiet and efficient men, fsnd
of music, reading and walking. He has
the interests of a wider education for
students at I.C. very much at heart,
and i s worried that students sometimes
wrongly regard General Studies ss im-
posed culture. Lest week he told me
that many of the ideas for lectures
come from students and student societ-
ies. So i f anyone has any ideas for
lunch-time lectures or lecturers, i f
they contact Mr. MoDowall they w i l l find
a most open-minded and appreciative l i s -
tener.
Frequenters of the Snack Bar
(next to the Union arch-way) have been
testing the new wicker furniture.
No doubt many more students w i l l now
be able to s i t down for coffee at the
strictly regimented lines of tables and
chairs, but I cannot help feeling a
l i t t l e nostalgia for the mare homely
atmosphere of the bays of shiny leather
settees, where one could lounge and
linger over a cup of coffee.
Early last Saturday morning as I
was crossing the Quad, I saw three very
pretty girls who were obviously i n dis-
tress. They could not find Room 110
in the hostel. Crowds of errant males
appeared from a l l over, hastening to
lead the way. One frustrate:! male
enviously wondered who was the lucky
fellow i n 110 who was having so many
beautiful visitors so early i n the day.
On consulting the resident l i s t he
found that the occupant was Miss Susan
Coombs! - itame j
THE FAIR SEX TRIUMPHS
Tony "Freedom from Women" Hodg-
son, past Editor of Phoenix, has sacrif-
iced his strong prinoiples by becoming
engaged to a pretty fraulein i n the re-
cord time of 3? weeks. He i s further
engaged - in research work at one of
the lesser-known Universities, where
he devotes some l i t t l e time to the pur-
suit of his kind of music: he i s now
leading clarinetist of a professional
group there.
He i s also writing a sequel t o
his scathing article to be entitled:
"Freedom from Women - But!"

Since as many as three expeditions
a year are now being sent to foreign
parts from this oollege, i t was thought
last year, that the formation of an
Exploration Society would help to
bring together the people interested in
this kind of thing. The sooiety now
exsists, and this term w i l l be sponsor-
ing a series of talks by prominent
explorers. It i s hoped to show sev-
eral films, some of them in conjunc-
tion with the Film Society and to
arrange slide shows of this year's
expeditions.
It i s not intended that the sooiety
w i l l officially sponsor expeditions and
the committee organise them. This
w i l l be left to the individuals i n the
sooiety and oollege. It i s hoped that
the sooiety might serve a useful func-
tion as a meeting plaoe of have been
and would be explorers. It i s hoped
that people proposing expeditions to the
Exploration Board (which i s a College
body and exsists only to finance and
equip expeditions) w i l l first of a l l
submit them to the sooiety, so that the
proposers might receive advice and get
the necessary oopies of the proposal
typed out. In this way the secretary
of the Exploration Board w i l l be saved
undue work i n the duplication of the
necessary numbers of oopies of the pro-
posal and the proposers themselves put
in a more favourable position since the
proposal w i l l then be presented i n the
correct form.

"REFRIGERATORS AND MUD HUTS"
On July 16th, the seoond Natural
History Society Expedition to Ghana set
sail, after some doubts and setbacks,
to continue their long term study of
vegetation decay under tropical condi-
tions.
Under their leader. Bob Sturrook,
the party of 6 zoologists and two bot-
anists settled i n the Bobirir Forest
some 25 miles from the town of Kumasi.
Communications were maintained by
truck, whioh also took the expedition
into the town for a "quiet" weekend;
celebrations of one sort or another
formed a large part of the party's
activities.
The main impression of Ghana-was
one of contrasts of extreme poverty
and wealth, of advanced technology and
startling squalor. A deep impression
was made on the expedition by the "High
Life" dances, some members watching the
dancers with distinctly un-aoologioal
eyes!
Passage complications forced the
party to split up on September 11th;
two sailed on the 12th and a further 3
on the 15th. The remaining 2, the
leader Bob Sturrook and John Webster,
travelled by truck to the Northern
Territories, looking far the snail
barriers of the tropical blood disease
[called Bilharzia. This part of the
country was very obviously poorer and
more primitive than the base area, the
men s t i l l oarrying bows and poisoned
arrows. Finally, the last remaining
member set sail on Sept. 24th for Eng-
land and expeot to arrive here on the
15th of October.
To disillusion those who imagine
that the party had a glorious sun-
bathe, only 10 sunny days were enjoyed
in the entire 6 weeks' stay; Ghana
oopies the U.K. in many ways - even the
weather.
This year the Rover Crew expedi-
tion was staged i n Andorra, the pin-
prick on the French-Spanish border,
camping 6 K
m from Sant Julia de Sarin
in the vicinity of a farmhouse and
1400 ft. above the town.
The rugged country i s l i t t l e
known and often the existing maps are
in error, which caused the crew to pio-
neer i t s own routes on many occasions.
In general, the rock i s rotten, prob-
ably due to the extremes of temperature
between day and night. An massing
variety of plants i s to be found >
despite rooks and dimatio conditions,
and one member alone pressed 260 spec-
ies.
The crew arrived some time before
the tourist rush started and soon be-
came well known among villagers. Dai
ly visits to the wine shop i n Sant
Julia made the crew popular with the
proprietor concerned, while the local
goat skin wine bottles provided much
entertainment to those not using them.
