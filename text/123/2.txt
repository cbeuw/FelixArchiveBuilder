GILLIAN
TILDEN-SMITH
A Cockney by birth, and proud of
i t , GUI was without hair until the age
of two, a precedent set by a past
President. She has had a varied
osoreor - from Convent School to Paris,
the Northern Poly and at last to I.e.,
we doubt i f the circle w i l l be completed
in the cloistered solemnity of a
nunnery.
Although G i l l i s perhaps best
known i n the f i e l d of sport for her
cricket, having organised the famous
I.C.W.A. v. 1st XL match, she also
plays tennis, table tennis and bad-
minton and i s an active member of the
under Water Club, even having been seen
on wet days practising with her flippen
in the quad.
A Botanical genius, she took part
in last summers expedition to Norway,
where a wet 6 weeks must have been
considerably enlivened by her high
spirits and ever present sense of hum-
our whioh prevailed even when washed
out of her tent on the f i r s t night and
later persuaded to vacate i t i n the
early hours of the morning by an i n -
quisitive horse.
H O N . S E C R E T A R Y
JOHN BELL
There is no truth i n the rumour
that John was eleoted Secretary of the
Union because he was the only candidate
able to speak to the President on his
own level. Born under Pisces in 1935
John has, parodoxically, a very dry
sense of humour which never leaves him,
even when watering policemen from the
heights of the Guilds building.
A product of Birkenhead School,
he graduated from the liech. Eng. Dept.
in 1957 end provided the excuse-
for con-
tinuing his Union activities by becoming
a fatigue expert - at least he is the
only person i n the Hostel who apprec-
iates the true relationshio between
stresses and strains on a logarhythmie
basis.
Gill's interests are not confined
to I.C. but extend in other directions
also. She has travelled extensively
and speaks several languages fluently,
as well as being able to make herself
understood i n a limited, though im-
portant, f i e l d of social l i f e i n many
others.
G i l l has strong views on the part
whioh I.C.W.A. should play i n college
l i f e which she divulged during an early
interview the morning after a party,
between sips of black coffee. (Pause
to extract wasp from the room with
simultaneous loss of G i l l to the depths
of her bed and one correspondent up
the wall).
Cn reappearing G i l l told us that
she thinks small groups of women oan
do more good than large ones, that
feminine influence on oommittees i s a
good thing and that $ postgrads are
insufficiently brought into oollege
l i f e .
Gills ambitions are modest,
wants to:
She
1) Visit every capital i n the world.
2) Marry a multi-millionaire.
3) Ply Mr. Garnett's pyjamas from the
flag pole.
(4) Write a book on the idiosyncracies
of carrots.
We left her happily crunching one"
and declaring that "she can't be
bothered to lead a sordid l i f e - i t ' s
too exhausting".
A glance at his room in the Hos-
tel is very revealing: the first thing
that strikes the visitor is that room
58 is bigger and better thai a l l the
others and i t come3 as no surprise to
find that John chose i t himself. Sport-
ing activities are apparent from the
well-used squash racquet, the hockey
boots in a tidy heap on the floor, and
the copiously autographed plate which
hangs on the wall. This plate is a
souvenir of a disgusting orgy which
marked the end of a tour of Holland
last year. John i s now Captain of
Hookey and i t is notable that his elect-
ion coincides with an unprecedented
surge of enthusiasm for the sport by
I.C.W.A.
Some say that his popularity with
women is connected with the blood-stain-
ed whip which is also part of the decor*
but we feel that this would be quite
out of character for John. It is more
likely that the woman in his l i f e act-
ually uses is* on him. Her softening
influence is apparent elsewhere in the
room, notably in the art-prints on the
walls, and in the strange new, books on
the shelf. Just above them stands the
tankards whioh are evidence of John's
successive servioe as Secretary and
Chairman of S.C.C.vin previous years.
People who devote much of their
time to running the Union are often
seen dashing about in their efforts to
cope with the job,'but this is not so
with John. The curious thing is that
he never appears to do any work, and
this is clearly a sign of great ef-
ficiency.
M O U N T A I N E E R S I N A L P S
This summer, ten members of the
Club, assembled by devious means i n
Cortina. d'Ampezzo to climb i n the Dol-
omites. With no previous experience
of the region, the short routes offered
by the Cinque Torri were selected as an
introduction to the area, and several
fine, exposed climbs were had by a l l
parties.
Spurred on by this taste of
dolomite climbing, nine members of the
party reassembled at the Cimo d i Lav-
arado to attempt a series of mare ex-
tended and ambitious routes, the tenth
member remaining i n Cortina to effect
repairs to a back axle. Amongst
their elimbs, including the 1,400 feet
north east corner of the Cime Grande,
two parties climbed an excellent very
severe route on the Piooolissima.
The oamp was now moved to the Passo
di Sella and a great deal of fine steep
climbing was dons on the Cinque Dita
and the Sella and Vaiolet Towers. Our
stay i n the Dolomites terminated with
a riotous dinner at the Refugio d i Sella.
Agreeing to reassemble i n Zermatt,
four members drove to Venice to f a c i l -
itate car repairs, while en route for
Zermatt, two others in a blue sports oar
had a slight disagreement with a stat-
ionary Mercedes. Minus wing and with
bent front axle, driver and a somewhat
shattered President miraculously appeared
in Zermatt some days later.
In spite of the changeable weather,
good snow and ice climbing was had on
the Dom, Monte Rosa, Nordend, and Pelix-
jooh, when one weighty member tested
his partner's s k i l l by jumping into
a sixfeet wide crevasse. Recovering
their composure, he was duly hauled out.
The weather showing signs of det-
erioration, four members walked from
the Monte Rosea to the HBrnli hut, hop-
ing to climb the Matterhorn. Their
hopes were crushed, however, by a
heavy overnight snow f a l l and i t was
decided to end the meet in view of the
weather and dwindling finances.
It was generally agreed that a
highly successful summer meet had been
held considering the fact that five
members had no previous alpine exper
ienoe.
During the course of these four
weeks,numerous colour photographs were
taken and i t is inteneded to show a
selection of these in the near future
for the benefit of anyone interested.
Information regarding this w i l l be
posted on the Mountaineering Club Notice
Board.
