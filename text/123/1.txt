ROBBERY WITH VIOLENCE

"The most ambitious project spon-
sored by the Exploration Board during
its two years' existenoe was a f u l l -
scale expedition to the Karakoram.
Only a preliminary report on the work
of this expedition oan be given at
this stage."
Thus reads part of the 1S55-57
Report issued by the Imperial College
Exploration Board last year.
For those whose memory has been
clouded by the passing years, allow me
to give a few details concerning the
Karakaram Expedition; six students
under the leadership of Mr. Eric Ship-
ton, with Dr. Budd as Medical Officer,
left England at the end of June 1957,
returning three months later. After
examination of the glaciers in this re-
ucte region of the Himalayas, the party
oorapleted geological, surveying and
general exploratory work.
The cost of this very enterpris-
ing expedition to the Exploration Board
was £5,052, together with a donation of
£1,000 from the Mount Everest Founda-
tion. Prof. H.H. Read, the Chairman
of the Board has stated that in general
terms the aim of the Board has been to
make available to as many students as
possible the valuable experience affor-
ded by soientifio expeditions. Sure-
ly i t cannot be denied, however, that
another «1» should be to publish the
work in a report. Not only would
suoh a report enhance the reputation
of the College, but would prove to
certain organisations who have been so
financially generous to the Board that
the work of the Expedition teams does
not cease when they return to Imperial
College.
Flans are going ahead at the moment
to send an expedition to Peru in 1959
to complete surveying and geological
work in the Andes. Not a l l the money
required oan be found within Imperial
College, and hence outside assistance
is essential.
Therefore,let not only Imperial
College know what i s happening, but
also the general public and soientifio
world by the daily press, lectures,
and radio. The Karakoram Expedition
has been the most ambitious and one of
the most successful expeditions ever

A T LAST AN I.C. STUDENT HAS HAD CAUSE TO WELCOME THE INTERVENTION OF THE POLICE.
/ \ LAST JUNE, WITH LONDON STILL IN THE THROES OF THE BUS STRIKE AND THE IMPERIAL
JL COLLEGE ENVELOPED IN THE PERSPIRING VORTEX OF EXAMINATIONS, A GENEROUS FATHER
DEIGNED TO ALLOW HIS CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SON THE USE OF HIS CAR - AN M.G. MAGNETTE.
THE DUTIFUL SON, ARRIVING FOR AN EXAMINATION, CAREFULLY PARKING HIS CAR IN FRONT OF
THE RODERIC HILL BUILDING, VANISHED FOR THE REQUISITE PERIOD OF MENTAL EXERTION.
Later, when the doors disgorged the unhappy band of examinees, the same stu-
dent was further confounded to find that his oar had disappeared. At f i r s t , sus-
pecting a student prank, he did not call the police but performed a painstaking
search of the area, unaware that the MG Magnette was speeding Northwards in des-
perate hands. The following day an elderly lady reported the loss of a new Rover
from outside her Chelsea flat.
i.e. IN ICELAND
organised by a College or University
in this country. But i n the long run
i t has been a fiasco, leaving behind
a story of bungling inefficiency.
Fifteen months later the only result
has been a miserable half-hearted
700-word report within the College.
No scientific report has been publish-
ed, and the unique and valuable col-
lection of geological specimens has
remained unexamined i n a crate since
i t s arrival. What i s lacking here?
Not imagination, but something more
important; the ability to oomplete a
job. From the Board of Governors to
the Freshers have we not some sort of
a leader in this meoca of soientifio
and administrative efficiency.
Is this the way to publioise
Imperial College and to obtain further
financial assistance for future expedi-
tions?
INTRODUCING
Two more regular features:-

Some 48 hours later i n Derby, a
oar was rammed by a Rover, the occup-
ants attacked and deprived of a case
oontaining £7,000 by two men who es-
caped in a waiting MG Magnette.
The oar was found weeks later
abandoned, lacking number plates, with
a burnt out engine. In due course,
four men involved in the robbery were
caught (C.I.D. knows how!) and pre-
sented themselves last week at the local
Magistrates Court. The student, mho
wishes to remain nameless, appeared at
the preliminary t r i a l . He confesses
that he was treated with rather less
respect than were the prisoners (whom
one presumes were well known to the
Magistrate!) He cited as an example
the following dialogue:-
Clerk: to accused, after student had
been questioned
"Would you like to ask the witness any
questions?"
Accused shake their heads.
Clerk: (to student, who has just signed
statement) Speaking very rapidly.
"IfcurGracicualjadyHMtheQueenshouid

Student looks at Clerk blankly
Long pause.
Clerk: (impatiently)
"Do you understand what this involves?"
Student:
"No" (The accused grin at him)
Clerk: (furiously)
"WELL, YOU SHOULD! It should not be
necessary for me to read i t again ....

One suspects that the court has
had to deal with students under some-
what different circumstances.
We are awaiting the result of
the Trial.
