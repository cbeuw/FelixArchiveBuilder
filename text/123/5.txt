THE NEEDLE
Dear Sir,
I really was appalled by the self-
oonsoioos tripe appearing over the name
of one "Cleopatra" i n your last issue.
The propagation of such an adolescent
approach to the facta of I.C. l i f e can
hardly be expected to engender any-
thing but distrust between the freah-
men and woe en, and I fear that this be
the writer's aim.
Having erected a hypothetical bar-
r i e r of indifference (manifesting Itself
i n rather unusual ways - "Women are to
be feared, avoided and ignored"), she self
oonsoiously examines ways of breaking
i t down. A woman should not attempt
to be "friendly", yet she should not
leave others "To make the f i r s t step".
Why, why, why, why cannot these women
simply behave i n a natural, normal,
f â€” ^ " i n " manner? Perhaps i t i s unfair
of me to attack them for being immature.
It i s hardly their fault. But the fact
is that the majority of I.C. women
im totally devoid in behaviour and out-
look of any semblance of mature fem-
ininity,as i s evidenced by Cleopatra's
article. Should further proof be
needed, l e t any man venture up to the
third floor of the new hostel, and watoh
the young ladies thumping gracefully up
and down the corridor to answer the tele-
phone. No wonder men get drunk and are
siok i n the quad.
One further point that Cleopatra
has missed i s this. Many men have
been to "boys only" schools: the
transition to a college with one woman
to forty men i s relatively painless.
For a woman, on the other hand, to be
suddenly planted at I.C. may well be a
terrifying experience, and some feeling
of being "hemmed-in" i s perhaps inevit-
able. Cleopatra should devote her
efforts to dispelling this, instead of
attempting to rally her girls beneath
her crusading banner. Or are we back
at Soedean now?
Safety from the screeohing horde
lies i n anonymity.
Yours from behind my barrier,
Ptolemy.
IN DEFENCE
Dear Sir,
Many people appear to have mis-
interpreted the spirit i n whioh my
article was written. It was intended
to bring into the open a problem to
whioh many members of the college -
both men and women - feel there should
be some solution. A v i t r i o l i c attack
such as the above letter does nothing
to help. It i s agreed that the situa-
tion mentioned i n the last paragraph
exists but the men should realise that
theirs i s the opportunity to help
remedy this.
a, small body of woman in
such a large college i s bound to excite
criticism and continual criticism i n -
spires self-consciousness. "A lady
is one who i s treated as such" but
perhaps the large number of men who
s t i l l behave as overgrown schoolboys
are Incapable of appreciating this.
Maturity includes a depth of understand-
ing, so obviously lacking i n the wri-
ter, and would produce the constructive
oritioism for whioh I hoped. I would
be delighted i f 'Ptolemy* would discard
his convictions and discuss this prob-
lem openly.
Yours very sincerely,
Gillian Tilden-Smith
(President I.C.W.A.)
WHITHER FAUNA ?
Dear S i r ,
I beg space i n your columns to
remind inmates of the petrified "BOT-
ANY" buildings that there i s more to I.C.
than just their own departments. New
students, not yet stunted by department-
al traditions can ( i f they wish) inherit
the dusty gloom that waits for them.
They can, i f they make an effort, re-
mind the rest of the College that they
exist.
One major complaint voiced by the
said inmates concerns the Natural His-
tory Soc., i n danger of becoming l i t t l e
more than an egg-headed extension of the
day's work. It's supposed to promote
"social" intercourse. Well, it's up
to i t s members to see that i t does and
do something about supporting the
rumoured dances,darts matches, inform-
al discussions at The Queens,etc. I f
this slice of R.C.S. fades into obliV-
ion i t will be i t s own fault.
Yours,
Sigmund Aagonschmidt
THE DODGERS
Dear Sir,
October l s t for students is like
January.lst for other people. It is
the beginning of a new year when resol-
utions are traditionally made.
I wonder i f I could influence
you or your readers at this stage?
Briefly and simply i t is this. Could
we have less of the National Servioe
dodging-type of letter. Last year, i f
I remember oorrectly, this was one of
the main topics aired in your corres-
pondence column, usually, i t would ap-
pear, by people who were afraid to spend
a horrible, rough, nasty two years away
from Mum. A great many students who
read your paper deoided to serve their
country first and attend college after-
wards. They, at least, are not plagued
by thoughts of avoiding National Service
and the uneasy consciences that go with
them: they are therefore not at a l l
impressed by these letters.
I hope that this letter is one
of only a few published on this sub-
ject during the next ten months. I f
Ithe students take a real interest i n
your excellent newspaper you will have
enough correspondence to replace this
dreary matter altogether.
Yours faithfully,
"SENEX MILES"
Enraged by his recent Profile,
Chubby Garnett has taken to running
to Hyde Park. What he does when he
gets there is no-body's business but
his own.

Why warn 'em, let '

'The latest betrousered weekend line
in I.C.W.A. Presidents (c.f. Cleo's
Needle) provokes more than the usual
barriage of derision. Rumours that
Chubby is going to retaliate by
wearing a weekend kilt are unfounded
as he says that his legs are not
sexy enough.

BOTTOMS UP
(From an Admiralty Pamphlet)
It i s important that these missiles
should be stored with the tops at the
bottom, and the bottoms at the top.
Therefore, to avoid mistaking the top
far the bottom and the bottom for the
top, the bottom of each missile has been
olearly labelled TOP.
RUBBISH SIR!
Sir,
I arrive at the entrance to the
Beit '..Juadrangle by Rolls-Bentley at
about 10.15 am. on most mornings of the
week. My chauffeur complains that he
cannot get into the kurb for me to a l -
ight because of sundry old crocks,
bicycles, scooters and other wheeled
contrivances parked right opposite the
"No Parking" sign. I find I have 3aoK"-
ed three chauffeurs and a chauiieuse in
ten days for what was, apparently, no
fault of theirs.
Nothing will induce m
e to use
the back entrance to the Union - re-
served for servants and brown-baggers
scurrying for the 73 bus - so can some-
one please keep the "No Parking" bit
olear, at least until after m
y arrival.
Yours faithfully,
Tennis Leston.
