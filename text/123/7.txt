On Saturday July 7th, a party of
Gliding Club members left Twnham by
road for the Cornish Gliding Club's
site at Perranparth. The party i n -
cluded Paul Mlnton, the leader of the
expedition, and Frank Irving, who had
just returned from the World Champion-
ships at Lezno i n Poland, The gliders
taken were the Club Skylark II "Phoenix"
and a privately owned Skylark III "Six-
ty-Six". A further Skylark I I was
taken by a small contingent of Surrey
Gliding Club members, together with a
Tiger Moth towing aircraft.
Perranporth was reached after dark
and the f i r s t night was spend in the
hanger, but as no flying was possible
on the Sunday camp was struck by an old
Spitfire disposal. Unfortunately Frank
Irving had to return to I.C. on Sunday
evening as he had been away in Poland
for a month.
Monday was notable for the rashness
displayed by a few pre-breakfast bathers
in the nearby sea, resulting in near
rigor mortis. Flying, but no soar-
ing, was possible on the following two
days giving no opportunity of familia-
rising members with the new site. On
Thursday B i l l Tonkyn was towed inland
in "Sixty-Six*and, releasing near
Truro, flew to Lostwithiel where he was
forced to land as he had flown too far
South of the l i f t . Several other
members had tows towards Truro and con-
tacted l i f t , but were not suitably
placed to use i t . Friday was the best
day of the week, with a light land
breeze and by 11 o1
clock thermals were
obviously rising above the site itself.
Paul Minton made the best flight of
the day, soaring locally for about an
hour, then flying to Trevose Head. He
landed at St. Ival while returning to
Perranparth as the sky seemed f u l l of
Shackletons. "Phoenix" was also
soared together with a Tandem Tutor
belonging to the Cornish Club.
Despite the sea-mist which pre-
vented flying for numerous hours, and
the lack of a sufficiently strong sea
breeze the week had been a suocess.
This was largely due to the availabil-
ity of the Tiger Motht as most of the
launches were by aero tow. Sincere
thanks are due to the Surrey tug-
pilot,' and to the Cornish Gliding (and
*Plying) Club for their hospitality,
the use of their two-seaters, and, of
course, the bar.

POOR OLD BO
When 'Bo' presented herself for
inspection at the Freshers' Receptions
proceeding the start of the Session, i t
waa with a deep feeling of embarrass-
ment on account of her inability to be
self-propelled. After a great deal of
time and hard work had been spent
cleaning and preparing her (and three
months oxidation on brass-work takes
some cleaning!), she was duly pushed out
into the open air to be started.
After half an hour's exhaustive swing-
ing (no mean feat when there are some
3 litres on the other end of the handle)
an ominous 'olonk' was heard from 'down
the front underneath'. A closer i n -
spection revealed that the supporting
bracket for the rocker arm of the off-
side exhaust valve had sheared. This
bracket oonsists of a short double arm,
and i t was obvious by the dirt and
grease that one side had been broken
for quite some time. The other side
had withstood the extra stress for as
long as possible, but had finally
fractured at this rather inopportune
time. As this failure put the off-
side cylinder out of action, starting
became impossible.
As insufficient Guildamen were
available to push 'Bo' to her place
of honour in front of the Union the only
vehicle of sufficient nobility qualified
to tow her waa very kindly brought to
our assistance by her keepers from
R.C.S. The sight of a noble, but tem-
porarily defeated, 'Bo' being towed by
a triumphant 'Jezebel' was almost aa
awe inspiring as i f the two had been
driven i n convoy.
A repair i s being effected as soon
aa possible, and i n a l l probability will
be completed by the time this reaches
print.

JEZEBEL ON PARADE
The R.C.S. Fire Engine emerged from
her summer hibernation on Saturday, Sept.
27th, for the second Historic Commercial
Vehicle Club rally at the ABC works,
Southall, the following day. Particular
attention was paid to the brass, as i t
was known that she would be facing works
competition. In the afternoon, she
was paraded round Earls Court, i n
company with half a dozen other vehicles,
to publicise the event.
An excellent lunch and tea were
provided by ABC Ltd. and their chair-
man - Lord Brabazon - judged the
'ooncours'. The driving tests unfort-
unately were curtailed considerably,
only a time-trial being held. However,
we managed to hold our own test when i t
was found that the fire engine, with
11-up, made a very satisfactory stand-
ing start up a 1 i n 7 test h i l l .
On Sunday, she arrived at South-
a l l to find a 1914 Dennis and two 1928
Dennis's already present. There were
also a Leyland and a Ford-T-based fire
engine, a l l these fortunate vehicles
being complete with pumps.
There were three steamers present,
including 'The Animals' Friend' - a
1903 engine used by the RSPCA to assist
horse-drawn vehicles up Crystal Palace
H i l l .
On the Freshers' Days, Jezebel was
used to tow Bo' out to the Union and
baok, and performed this very satis-
factorily. However, on her trip round
the Park, she was ignominiously allowed
to run out of petrol, and had to be
pushed home, completing, as you will
see, the trio of not particularly mobile
chariots.
CLEM FOULED
With the rally at Southall as
her goal, "Clementine* duly left the
Union at 10.15 a.m. on Sunday 28th
September with 125 p.s.i.
A l l went smoothly until she reached
Gillette Corner, when i t was discovered
that a sack of Anthracite instead of
Welsh Dry Steam Coal had inadvertently
entered her grate, and effectively
killed the fire. Then, after a five
and a half hour delay, help arrived
in the form of a sack of low-grade house-
coal, extracted from the research lab.
and delivered by Humber Snipe: with this
stimulant Clem, managed to return under
her own steam.
The crew, both professionally con-
sorted with the N.C.B., have not yet-
lived the blunder down!
