Just over 50 freshmen attended the
Soccer Trials at Harlington last Wed-
nesday, when several practice games
were played. The overall standard of
play was quite high,so that competition
for the seven teams being run this year
should be very keen. The final trials
were held on Saturday, and i n view of
the standard of the matches played,the
club looks forward optimistically to
a highly successful season.

Ihe Athletics Club wishes to thank
two of i t s past members, Les Locke and
John Evans, for their services over the
last few years; we shall find i t
extremely difficult to replace them.
Les, who i s s t i l l a member of the
College, has now turned professional
footballer, playing for Queens Park
Rangers. John, who has l e f t the Col-
lege, I believe i s now earning his l i v -
ing.
On behalf of the Athletics Club,
I would like to wish you both every
success i n the future.

Last year the club had a moderately
successful season. The Swimming section
won the University Swimming Champion-
ship because of Stirling work by the
two Rogers; however the Water Polo
section did not do so well. The club
had numerical strength far three teams
but quality was lacking: the first team
after a good start, later faded because
of insufficient training and too much
alcohol.

e extend a hearty welcome to our
freshers. It looks as i f we have a
good ohance of retaining the University
Championship, and the Polo team with
training and new recruits should doubt-
less improve on last seasons performance.

T E N N I S IN WINTER ?
There i s a school of thought, which
considers that tennis i s essentially
a summer game. For those who dis-
agree, there exists a olub i n each of
the three constituent colleges, whioh
has the audacity to arrange tennis
matches throughout the Autumn and Spring
Terms.
The City and Guilds Lawn Tennis
Club has always been able to field a
strong team, beating most other London
University oolleges and, for the fur-
therance of this reputation, requires
a l l Guildsmon tennis players to inspect
the olub notioe board, situtated i n
Guilds entrance hall, and attend the
practices advertised thereon. The
practices take place at Bishops Park
Courts, Fulham Palace Road, S
.

every Wednesday afternoon, and matches
have been arranged for every Saturday
morning throughout the term. Last
season Guilds L.T.C. was able to field
two teams of six players and, i f
sufficient support i s forthcoming, w i l l
do so again this season.
So oontinue your enjoyment of
tennis through the whole year and help
to raise your own and our standard of
play. Balls are provided by the olub,
nylon racquets are usually necessary
webbed feet are an advantage.

The Crosscountry Club has gained
about a dozen freshers, and, from
the results of the two trials held so
far, several of them appear to be very
good. W
e welcome a l l new members, and
hope they w i l l enjoy running with us
whether in the first team or the second,
and always, i t appears, in the rain.
Tomorrow our f i r s t fixture of the
tana i s the U.C. Relay far whioh we
have entered two teams. However, a
team consisting ohiefly of postgradu-
ates did have one race during the vaca-
tion, finishing 14th in the St. Albans
Crosscountry Relay.
Club training will take place at
lunchtimes on Tuesdays and Thursdays
(meet i n the changing room at 12.45 p.m.)
and on Sundays at 1100 a
.
m
. at the Hur-
lingham track, Putney Bridge. Circuit-
training facilities w i l l be available
to members on Mondays and Thursdays,
5-6 p.m.
We look forward to another success-
ful season, and hope to retain the U.L.
Cup in the Championships this ooming
December.

The number of freshers joining
the hockey club this year has fallen
in comparison with last. In this
respect the trials have been disap-
pointing, but the quality of play has
been good.
We are rather fortunate to have
lost very few of last year's "old
faithfuls"; i n fact last year's l s t
XI has lost only one player. I hope
this will not discourage some of the
freshers who may find themselves in the
2nd XI, whereas i n previous years they
would probably have made the lst.
It i s extremely difficult to
forecast the final strength of the
teams until after the U.L. Trials.
Last year the olub provided five of the
University side and should have a simi-
lar number this season. I f we oan
equal the record of last year, and im-
press on the U.L. Cup results - and
there i s no reason why not - i t will be
an excellent year.
WANTED:- One brave, resolute man
as hookey goalkeeper. Armour provided.
Apply to any of the Hookey Club Com-
mittee.
Last, but not least, we would like
to welcome a l l freshers and hope they
have an enjoyable season with the club.
