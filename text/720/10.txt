The whole carnival kicks
off in typical IC style with
the RCS Beer Festival on
Wednesday. Starting at
noon in the SCR before
lectures have even finished
for the day, this event will
showcase various types of
beer from far afield.
Assuming you survive
Wednesday's assault on the
digestive and nervous
systems, then Thursday
bring its own attack on the
visual and auditory systems
instead, in the form of the
RCS Smoking Concert.
This show is best described
as a cross between Live Aid
and the Wheeltappers' and
Shunters' Club. The
patience and dedication of
the performers is nothing
compared with the patience
and dedication of the
audience. It takes place at
7.00pm in the Union
Concert Hall.
Right, you can take your
ear plugs out now.I said
you can take your ear
plugs out! Thank you.
With the passing of the
Smoking Concert comes
Friday, and ignoring small
inconveniences like
lectures, at lunchtime the
Aerosoc Darts Tournament.
Taking place at the top of
the Union Building you can
fire your prototype origami
warheads into Beit Quad
which doubtless have been
constructed in the
mornings' lectures.
This is followed in the
evening by the Rag and
Drag Disco. No prizes for
guessing what this one's
about; starting at 7.00pm in
that den of corruption, the
Holland Club. Turn up in
drag and you might get a
few laughs if nothing else.
But at least it's a legitimate
excuse for getting in to
"mummy's" clothes.
After all this, it is
probably unlikely that you
will be able to get up next
morning—but if you live in
Southside it may be
difficult to avoid, since
RCSU will be meeting
directly underneath. Along
with the other C C U s at
their respective offices,
Strange things happen at
the Beer Festival.
they are gathering for the
Rag Week 24-Hour Street
Collection. If you stand
around one of the C C U
offices you will be given a
mandate to go out and
wreak havoc around
London, hassling Joe
Public for money, armed
only with your collecting
can and a month's supply
of Rag Mags. Or if you
prefer more direct sales
techniques a machete. Be
there or be cuboid.
In the evening is S C A B
Night. Nothing to do with
blackleg labour or Bubonic
Plague, this is where the
various societies in the
Social, Cultural and
Amusements board show
off their wares. Opsoc for a
change have not found
some piece of Gilbert and
Sullivan to carve up,
instead they are performing
their "Horrortorio" while
Dramsoc will stage a
"Ripping Yarn" and
generally act coarsely.
Debsoc are presenting a
balloon debate and we are
assured that Jesus Christ
will be returning for the
event. There will also be a
Trombone Trio, various
bands and a showing of
that film made for the
residents of Bernard
Sunley, National
Lampoon's Animal House
On Sunday you might
have thought that you
would be allowed to get
some sleep for a change,
but it is not to be. For at
that unsociable time of
10.00am the CCUs are
holding a Tug'o'War in
Princes Gardens. Not
content with that, they
suddenly rush off to the
Serpentine to climb onto
strange artifacts
• constructed from lumps of
polystyrene and old
packing cases. These then
proceed to sink gracefully
beneath the waters, while
the Execs mounted atop
paddle vainly to the other
side. Called a Raft Race it
often resembles more the
harbour at Scapa Floe. The
raft construction is
generally left to each CCUs
Transport Officer, who is
presumably burnt at the
stake afterwards.
The Film Night follows in
the evening, in the Concert
Hall at 7.00pm.
The weekend dutifully
ends; it's a new week, and
following whatever form of
torture your department
chooses to inflict on you
on Mondays, is the
challenge to Drink A Pub
Dry—or least drink it
slightly damp. Meet in the
Union Bar, perform a
lighting raid on a less than
well-stocked pub, and
make a landlord very
happy.
Unwelcome, though it
may be, Tuesday arrives.
Hopefully you have bought
in enough coffee to cope
with the after effects of
stripping a pub. At night is
the RSM Dirty Disco. It is
time to dust off your dirty
old macs to meet all those
rather mature looking
schoolgirls.
Wedneday is Morphy
Day. This annual event has
the strangest effect on ICU
Sabbaticals. The present
Exec is believed to suffer
from a rare syndrome
known to the medical
profession as Tinnitus
Morphii', the symptoms of
which are an acute ringing
in the ears when ever the
words 'Morphy Day' are
mentioned thus causing
any discussion on the
matter to be unheard.
However this is nothing to
previous years where'
Paranoius Morphy' took
hold of the Exec, resulting
in a lightning ban on the
whole event.
Why should this event
cause such strange
diseases? Why should a
memorial to the Morphy in
Morphy Richards be so
controversial? It's simple
when you think about it,
and the residents of Putney
often do. Basically the
whole thing revolves
around a large piece of
wood called the Morphy
Oar.
In principle the battle for
the Oar is a boat race
along the Thames from
Putney Bridge between the
three CCUs. However once
the race begins, a raging
battle ensues for the oar,
which remains on land. The
weapons of war tend to be
buckets of rotting fish and
general refuse thrown in a
vicious three way battle.
After all this, when
somebody finally rides off
with the Oar in their van,
everybody trips down to
Harrods for the famous tea,
smelling of excrement,
rotting vegetables and
various other noxious
substances. Needless to
say, they generally get
thrown out.
The evening brings a
reconciliation barnight in
the Union Bar starting at
7pm, where, hopefully
everyone will have had a
shower first. If you don't
know what a Barnight
constitutes yet, then you've
probably had your head
buried in what got thrown
around earlier today.
Following the barnight is
the Idiosyncratic Event; so
called because nobody
knows what it is going to
be
Alongside in the Union
Snack Bar at 7.00pm also is
the RSM Ragarama.
Nobody seems to know
what this is either, although
we have been assured that
it is not Hon Porn Night
under a different guise.
If you like leaping about
with a finger stuck in your
ear whenever somebody
mentions "pilchards", then
you're an obvious victim of
Martin S Taylor and his
Hypnosis demonstration
starting at 7.30pm in the
Great Hall.
Lectures have finished
again for the week, but the
One Million and One Darts
Competition is just
beginning. Will it ever end?
There is only one way to
make sure, go down to
Southside and throw some
darts ... before going to the
Guilds Carnival.
Misty in Roots and Attila
The Stockbroker return to
Imperial College in a night
of entertainment in the
Union Building. It's just like
the Freshers' Ball, except
for a change you might
even know somebody
there.
Saturday heralds the end
of Rag Week, but starting
early in the morning is
Charles Brereton playing
an upright piano for charity
into the not so small hours
of Sunday morning. He is
performing in one of the
Commitee Rooms at the
top of the Union Building.
Also starting on Saturday
morning is the Inter-
Hall/House Street
Collection. Your Hall
Commitee should be telling
you all about the weird
things they are organising
for it-if not find out why.
But Rag Week is rounded
off by the Cocktails served
in Southside Bar in the
evening, and so for another
year the Week slowly winks
out of existence,ready to
start again, same time,
same place, next year.
"A Fiver? Where?" Weird scenes on Morphy Day.
who are those masked men?
The Guilds Hit Squad is one the most feared
organisations in college. No-one knows when, where or
how they will strike next. Contract Flanners, they are
entirely without pity or compassion for their victims.
If you go to the Beer Festival on Wednesday you may
notice a group of strangely dressed people. Clad in a
range of disguses, generally consisting of lab-coats, safety
glasses and various other accoutrements, they quickly
spring into action. Spraying shaving foam onto paper
plates, they silently select random targets and then
gratuitously "flan" them. There is no escape.
This is the first official Hit of the year; but there will be
more. From now on, all hits will be of the contract variety.
You can pay to have friends and enemies flanned at the
most embarrasing times possible-but only if the price is
right. Even lecturers are not immune - once they give their
consent they usually end up with considerably more than
egg on their faces.
Needless to say, the Squad does give rise to cheap
imitations; however there is nothing quite like the real
thing, since all the money raised from contracts goes to
the various Rag Charities.
If you wear contact lenses, then you can get badges
from the Union Office which will give a special
dispensation from normal flanning: but don't expect to get
immunity-they will just find somewhere else to flan you.

Bill Bailey is trying to start his own record company up.
The first single has just been released, which apparently is
Britain's first ever "Go-Go Rap", or something like that. He
is selling 50 copies of the record for "3.00 each; the profits
from which go to Rag. Unfortunately you may not be able
to get to hear it first, since IC Radio are not playing it. If
you are interested then copies are available from the
Union Office. The man himself can be found via Petrology
I.
