SAJUULWOA Quick to
RAG Weelc
ell here it iS the second practical in your
BSc(Hons) Applied Liver Cirrhosis course. Freshers' Week
is a distant loss of memory in the past, and the plink, plink
ouch of those aspirin mornings has disappeared.
Or so it seemed, for on Wednesday the booze really
begins to flow again. Rag Week is upon us
Rag Week at times tends to
make Freshers' Week look
like just a quiet sherry
party. It encompasses
events as varied as gigs in
the Concert Hall and shit
flinging on Morphy Day. It
also ends up as being quite
a bit longer than a week.
Officially starting on
Wednesday and winding up
a week on Saturday, it is
the longest period of non-
stop entertainment all year.
And it all revolves around
one concept-Money. You
either raise it for a charity
or most of the time just
spend it yourself.
So this is the week where
you will see more students
than usual wandering
around the College Bank,
being charmingly polite to
all of the staff and all after
one thing: the biggest
growth industry in the
world-The Overdraft. If you
don't feel like doing this
yourself, alternatives
include obtaining a sawn-
off shotgun and a box of
stockings with which to
move into the Armed Cash
Withdrawal business, or to
take up printing various
bits of paper bearing
something about 'promising
to pay the bearer'. However
these methods are strictly
short term but they may
solve the problem of
finding accomodation next
year, even if it is on
Wandsworth Common.
Once you have sorted
out your bank manager,
one way or the other, you
can move onto exploring
the many strange events
that take place at IC next
week. That oh-so-street
credible wasted and
haggard look, reminiscent
of hangovers and sleep
deprivation can soon be
yours merely by attending
these events.
