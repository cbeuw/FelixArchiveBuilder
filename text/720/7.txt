Coronary heart disease is
responsible for more
deaths in the western world
than any other disease. Yet,
in the majority of cases, if
the disease had been
detected at an early stage
in its development, then
simple changes in lifestyle
could have greatly reduced
the risk. Here at Imperial
College Dr Don Monro and
Dr Malcolm Clarke, from
the Computing Department,
have developed a new
system which is able to
resolve the complex
patterns of body surface
electrocardiagrams, and to
display the response of the
heart to exercise testing
with great accuracy. This
new system has the
potential to detect heart
disease while still at an
early stage.
As the heart beats, an
electrical signal is
generated by currents
similar to those that flow in
any muscle as it contracts.
These electrical currents
flow through the body and
appear simultaneously all
over the surface, altering in
magnitude and spatial
pattern as the heart beats.
The traditional
that developments in
computer technology have
overcome these difficulties,
and opened up the
possibility of developing a
self-contained system,
which is small enough for
widespread use.
Dr Monro and Dr Clarke,
in devloping the new
system, have taken a fresh
look at the way information
can be displayed. They
obtain data on the heart's
electrical activity from a
large number of electrodes,
at present forty which are
located across the chest
and back of the patient.
This data is then processed
to produce a 'map', which
shows how the magnitude
of electical activity varies
over the back and chest
area. With the system it is
possible to measure this
body surface electrical map
at a rate of 500 per second.
The prototype of this
system is already in
operation at St Mary's
Hospital, Paddington;
where it is being used for
exercise testing of the
hearts of patients with
suspected coronary
disease, and for studying
patients following open
Pattern produced by a normal heart
This map indicates a diseased heart
electrocardiagram
measures the signal at a
few standard locations, and
displays it as a two
dimensional plot of
electrical activity against
time. However, as the
shape of the
electrocardiagram varies
greatly with location, much
of the available information
is not used. There are
many problems associated
with measuring, processing
and displaying the great
wealth of data that can be
obtained, if you look at the
heart's elctrical activity as it
appears all over the body
surface. It is only recently
heart surgery. If a healthy
person exercises their heart
rate gets faster, but the
shape of the
electrocardiagram doesn't
change. However, if a
person suffering from an
ischaemic heart disease
exercises, an oxygen debt
builds up, and there is a
very distinct change in the
shape of the
electrocardiagram. The
most common form of
ischaemic heart problem is
coronary artery disease,
where cholestrol builds up
in the arteries, narrowing
them and so restricting the
blood flow. Although the
T h e H e a r t of
t h e M a t t e r
system is capable of
measuring the electrical
activity 500 times a second,
in practice it will do so
once every beat of the
heart, at a point between
contraction and recovery
phase. At this point, when
exercising, there is a quite
significant difference in the
appearance of the 'map' for
a healthy person and for a
person suffering from
ischaemic heart disease.
This is illustrated in fig. 1,
which shows the patterns
obtained from a healthy
patient and a patient with
heart disease. The major
advantage of this system is
that it can detect these kind
of heart problems while
they are still at an early
stage, whereas traditional
electrocardiagram
measurements can only
diagnose severe cases. At
present they are
investigating the possibility
of using the pattern to
diagnose exactly which
artery is the problem.
The system should prove
to be valuble for
surveillance of post
coronary patients during
rehabilitation. But most
important, it opens up the
possibility of regular heart
disease scanning for the
whole population. While
most people are aware of
the dangers associated with
smoking, lack of exercise
and poor eating habits,
very few change their
lifestyles accordingly.
Diagnosis of coronary
disease, while at an early
stage, could provide the
jolt' needed to persuade
people to do something
while there is still time.
However, heart scanning
on this scale would be very
costly, and whether it
becomes a reality would
largely depend on future
financial constraints.
At present, the system is
still at the evaluation phase,
but it is hoped that in
future it will be widely used
for early detection and
accurate diagnosis of
various forms of heart
disease.
