Enfield 3 - IC 1sts 2
IC started with only ten
men as Ian Parker dozed
somewhere in West
Kensington and on a fast
playing astroturf surface we
were under heavy pressure
with Jon Stonham cleverly
heading an Enfield short-
corner over the bar.
Captain Paul Smith scored
from a short-corner to
make it 1-1 at halftime, but
when Ian finally arrived,
late in the second half we
were 3-1 down. Ian had an
immediate effect laying on
a goal for Paul, but alas it
was all to no avail.
IC 2nds 3 - Hampstead 0
The seconds clinched their
first win of the season with
an emphatic, well earned 3-
0 victory over Hampstead
on Saturday.
From the first minute IC
dominated the game from
the midfield with Josh and
Dave Gott, in particular,
outstanding in that
department. Several
chances went begging until
on the stroke of half-time
Josh flicked the ball home
following a spell of constant
pressure on the
opposition's 'D'.
The second half saw IC
go further into tha lead
when Nick Hope, after
having come close on two
previous occasions,
provided a mesmeric
display of finishing to rifle
home the second goal. In
the throes of the match Jim
Ward rounded things off
with another brilliantly
taken goal to make the final
score 3-0
Team: Phil Choudhu.y
(Capt), Miles Cowley, Chris
Harrison, Grant Wood,
Greg McQueen, Josh, Dave
Gott, Jim Ward, Nick Hope,
Dave Whitton, John Carter,
Paul Chandler.

IC 3rds 2 Mill Hill 0
IC thirds overwhelmed Mill
Hill thirds on Saturday
afternoon at Harlington.
Goals by Vernon Morris,
from a short corner, and
Nick Baggott were enough
to beat a team who lacked
real penetration. 'Keeper
Mark Harris and defenders,
Dave Ling, Ian Mace and
Hugh, Southey managed to
stifle what attacks there
were. Oz, Per Dullforce and
Nick Baggot and Spence
created attacks that tore
the Mill Hill defence apart,
Dave Heslop, Vernon
Morris, Richard Ellis and
Richard Smith provided a
solid base in midfield.
^Victorious and knackered Hockey 3rds minus Hugh Southey.
SOP 1 - RCS 4
Having littered the walkway
with Mech Eng's
sandwiches, Graham (A
very very unimportant
member of this side) finally
managed to complete the
first obstacle of arriving at
Turkey Street (where?)
before dusk. Tnen with
resounding team effort we
managed to find the
changing rooms. The game
started, and after much
biased refereeing RCS were
lucky not to be behind (Ha!
ha!), Dick-less managing at
last to get the ball in the
goal.
In the second half RCS
finally took control and
slaughtered SOP. Per
slotted home and Chris (Mr
Experience) showed his
ultimate skills by flicking
the ball neatly past the
goalie (an unimportant goal
was also scored by Dave).
Special mention must
also go to John's brilliant
and sparkling runs down
the right wing, also Miles
and Adrian
Due to an oversight by
the team we arrived at the
station with half an hour to
waste and so just had to hit
the Turkey executive
drinking society for a quick
jar of I PA. No thanks go to
team floosie, Jackie.
IC 1sts 4 - Charing X 0
IC bounced back from
Wednesday UAU
disappointments to score a
convincing 4-0 victory. An
excellent team performance
was the cornerstone of the
â€¢ result with IC's defence of
Martin Bradley, Laurence
Covill, Rob Clarke and
Bryce Goldsbrough
outstanding, keeper Nick
Tarn only having one shot
to save during the game.
Praise must also go to
the IC forwards, Guy
Poppy and Dave Lynne for
their tireless running
causing three CXWM
defence to make several
mistakes.
IC's first came midway
through the first-half from a
Paul Bravery shot from 12
yards. The second came
from a through ball from
Alex Lunghi which found
Dave Lynne who beat the
advancing keeper from a
narrow angle. Midway
through the second half IC
added a third when Paul
Bravery latched onto a bad
goal-kick and beat the
keeper with a fierce drive
from the edge of the box.
The fourth came in the
closing minutes when the
CXWM Keeper failed to
hold onto a shot, leaving
Shaun Thomas with a
simple tap in from 3 yards.
Kent 1sts 6 - IC 1sts 0
Just to prove that we don't
just report the good
performances, last
Wednesday we went, we
played and we got stuffed.
But seriously though, IC
came up against a very
organised and fit (and big!)
Kent team who showed IC
the value of having a full
time trainer.
Three goals in the first 15
minutes gave Kent a flying
start from which IC never
really recovered. One goal
coming from a long throw,
and two from corners.
After this IC woke up and
gradually brought
themselves back in to the
game and should have
pulled one back when the
Kent keeper failed to hold a
Paul Bravery free kick but
Alex Lunghi failed to
convert the rebound.
The game remained even,
until the last 15 minutes
when Kent's superior
fitness began to tell,
scoring three late goals to
give a scoreline which
flattered the opposition.
