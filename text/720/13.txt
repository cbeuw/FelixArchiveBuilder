Scout and Guide
For those of you who don't
know, Imperial College
Scout and Guide Club is a
general outdoor club
specialising in climbing, hill
walking and caving.
Two weeks ago on a
Friday evening saw us t
setting off from Beit Arch
for Settle, Yorkshire. The
main activities planned for
the weekend were an
attempt on the Three Peaks
walk, climbing, and some
caving as well.
Saturday morning, and
14 people who had been
persuaded to do the Three
Peaks (Pen-y-ghent,
Whernside and
Ingleborough) set off. At
lunchtime, within sight of
the inn, the decision was
made to miss out the
middle peak through lack
of time. Amply refreshed,
we ascended the North-
East ridge of Ingleborough
then descended the five
miles back to the van. The
three peaks walk, which
ascends almost 6000 feet
and crosses 23 miles of
some of the best limestone
scenery in the country, is
an excellent introduction to
hill walking if you relish
peat bogs and are
reasonably fit.
QT
Which Imperial College
Society was recently
described by the Bishop of
Durham as 'about as much
use to humanity as a
musical condom'? Who is
better known for their left-
wing support than Neil
Kinnock's jock-strap? And
what organisation contains
more pricks than a
porcupine's pyjamas? The
correct answer to all of the
above questions is
probably not QT. QT, that
valiant band of crusaders,
constantly compaigning for
truth, justice and crotchless
panties; eternally searching
for love, honour and those
little brown metal things
one never has quite enough
of in a Meccano set.
QT, the people who
always exercise the utmost
discretion when performing
oral sex in crowded
restaurants. That
wandering band of
philanthropic visionaries
who published The socio-
political effects of
Hydraulic Despotism on a
Feudalistic Society' a book
rightly regarded as a
classic of its kind.
(Although the sequel
'Brenda Bristols conquers
the Nympho's from Mars'
has been less well received,
most critics regarding it as
a marked deviation from
the original train of
thought). All of this is
brought to the uncultured
masses via the only society
to run (hugely successful)
Dramsoc
Following the successful
lighting workshop last
week, our workshops took
another hairpin turn with a
new series of those old
favourites, the acting
workshop, along with a
new host. John Burgess
will be taking a slightly
different direction in that
quest to brush up on your
acting, or to begin from
scratch. It doesn't matter if
your last part was the walk
on bit in you junior school
nativity play, or even if you
didn't get cast, you're
welcome here. All you have
to do is meet in the
storeroom, Level two and a
half, Union Building West
Staircase, on Wednesday at
2.30pm.
If your interest is more in
line with making noises,
banging nails into lumps of
wood, then you might like
evening classes in 'How to
copulate with the partner of
your choice, without them
even noticing'.
The leader of this
imaginative tribe of would-
be Gandhis is a mysterious
figure, whom we shall call
Ralph. Despite being
described by his own
mother as ' a waste of a
perfectly good set of
kidneys', Ralph enjoys a
healthy, active life as an IC
postgrad. His favourite
colour is blue and his
ambition is to reach
puberty.
QT, the society that
needed a lift, deserved a
lift, did indeed have a lift
their meeting this week was
held in Huxley, in the lift.
This Tuesday QT is proud
to present a lunchtime
Comedy Cabaret at 1pm in
Physics LT1 (just inside
Physics main entrance.).
Performing will be the
incredible Brown Paper
Bag Brothers who were a
massive hit when they
appeared for QT last year.
Starring is John Hegley of
the popticians, also seen
on Carrott's Lib. His
partner in crime (the
offence in question being
rustlingVs the always aptly
named Otis Canneloni, who
also performs a 'Star Wars'
cabaret act under the name
of Obi-Wan Canneloni.
Admission is £1 for QT
Membership and entry. All
profits are going to RAG.
Please come along and
bring all your friends. We
promise you'll have a good
time!
to go to the Sound and
Stage workshop on 20
November, or just pop up
to the store room any

someone there.

Wind Band
Imperial College Wind
Band consists of a group of
musicians that meet every
Monday for the rehearsal of
a varied selection of Wind
Band and Military Band
music. From the large
repertoire of music (over
one hundred pieces are
owned by the Band), about
five pieces are chosen at
the beginning of each term
to be performed later that
term, usually during the
last two weeks. In addition,
a carol concert also takes
place in the autumn term,
where Christmas music as
well as carols are
performed. The music that
the band plays is generally
light-hearted—a couple of
marches and 'fun' pieces
are usually included
amongst the more serious
pieces in each concert.
Having said that, the music
is often demanding and
difficult in places, but
playable with a little
practice, and the end result
is usually very pleasant.
Concerts are held in the
open air (weather
permitting) by the Queen's
Tower, and everybody is
invited to listen, completely
free of charge. The concert
this term is on November
12 at 1.00pm, so if you're
not busy, why not come
along? The pieces to be
performed are 'Orpheus in ;
the Underworld' by
Jacques Offenbach,
'Hootenany' by Harold
Walters, The Thunderer' (a
March), and part of
'Concerto for Band' by
Gordon Jacob.
In conclusion, anybody
out there that can blow
down a clarinet, trumpet, or
any other wind instrument
(or play percussion) is
invited to join the band.
The more people that turn
up, the better the band will
be, which must benefit
everybody. Rehearsals are
on Mondays at 5.45pm in
the Great Hall. Please turn
up if you can!
Tennis
The Tennis club is holding
a Cheese and Wine
Evening on Tuesday
November 12 at 7.30pm in
