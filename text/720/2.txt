Union Planning Group
Union President, Carl
Burgess, presented the
document that outlines how
the Union should set about
taking over the Union Bar
to College House
Commitee on Wednesday.
This document is
amazingly vague. It ignores
the administrative and the
financial problems
associated with the
takeover. For example, the
Union Bar floor needs
replacing in a year. This
may cost as much as
twenty thousand pounds. If
the Union is to pay for this
in the first year of
operation, it may have
severe problems finding the
money. Carl claims that
you can't lose money on a
bar. Perhaps he should
consult South Bank Poly
who manage to do this
regularly.
Carl called a Union
Planning Group meeting.
He attempted to hide the
discussion document from
them saying it wasn't
important. He attempted to
prevent FELIX printing
details of it after John
Smith had contacted him.
(Incidently, despite Carl's
claims at the U G M that he
only had the document two
days before the Union
Planning Group, FELIX got
a copy a week and a half
earlier). The Union
Planning Group, which
included many of the
Union's senior non-
sabbatical officers,
managed to persuade Carl
to amend the discussion
document. They attempted
to tighten it up. Carl has
now changed his mind. In
private he says it was
because College
administrators persuaded
him the amendments were
a bad idea.
Carl himself recognises
some of the snags
associated with taking over
the Bar. I quote from one
of the documents
presented to Union
Planning Group: 'The
Union Bar floor has
recently undergone its last
sanding, it will need to be
replaced in the next two
years. This will cost a lot of
money that should have
been earmarked by the bar
committee several years
ago, hopefully this has
been done and so we will
not have to pay for it. I
shall speak to the College
Secretary about this
matter'. Perhaps Carl
should have asked John
Smith before he agreed to
take control on January 1.
Many Union Officers are
worried about what will
happen if the Union Bar
loses money. Carl told
them that he thought
College would bail the
Union out if the Bar lost
money. Unfortunately,
when Carl presented the
takeover document on
Wednesday, Financial
Secretary, Brian Lloyd
Davies, said there was no
the students are given an
opportunity to discuss the
issues.
Sherry
At 8pm on Monday evening
guests at the Union sherry
party were told there was
no more sherry even
though there were at least
fifty bottles in Dave
Kingston's office. This
way College could help the
Union if the Bar lost
money.
Almost everyone wants
us to gain control of the
Bar. However the Union
must ensure that it gets a
reasonable deal. We musn't
be rushed into getting the
Bar. When the Union
Refectory was taken over
by the Union it took about
six months of planning.
Carl seems to think we can
take over a bar in two
weeks.
The Union should plan a
management system for the
Bar. Does anyone know
whether we can cope
without a financial advisor?
The Union should examine
other union run bars. The
Union also needs to
examine the financial
problems associated with
the Bar. It needs to find
where the money for
replacing the floor of the
Bar can come from. It
needs to ask College how
much it will be expected to
pay for overheads such as
cleaning.
After years of College
control, an extra few
months before the takeover
would make little
difference, and avoid the
risk of the takeover causing
severe problems.
UGM
Tuesday's UGM was a
farce. There were several
important issues for
discussion. Obviously, the
takeover of the Union Bar
needed full discussion. It is
the most serious thing the
Union has done in several
years. The Union could
lose thousands of pounds
on a badly managed bar.
UGM Chairman, Chris
Hendy, allowed the meeting
to degenerate into a
shouting match where
normal discussion was
impossible. Chris should be
impartial, not make fun of
speakers from the chair.
For many students the
UGM is their only real
opportunity to question
sabbaticals' action. Chris
Hendy should ensure that
means the Union was left
with over £100 worth of
sherry. Maybe it was
returned to the suppliers. I
doubt it. I guess it has been
used to keep the Union
Office stocked up for the
rest of the year. The Union
Office argue that it is in the
Union's interest to put on a
sherry party to meet people
from College. Why is it in
the Union's interests to buy
a year's supply of sherry?
Sabbaticals
The Union is being run
incompetently. Carl has
managed to risk wasting
£1500 by banning the Rag
Mag after he had the
opportunity to censor it. He
has risked ruining our
takeover of the bar with
insufficient planning. On
Tuesday he had a meeting
with College Secretary,
John Smith, pissed out of
his brains. If that doesn't
damage our relations
nothing will.

Dave Kingston is totally
clueless. He is meant to
look after the Union
Building. Union House
Committee members,
though, say that he has
done almost nothing in this
area. He is meant to look
after the finances, yet
Union Finance Committee
members say he doesn't
know how the Union
finances work.
Sabbaticals are paid to
work for you. That means
they should do their best
for you. They shouldn't get
pissed at lunchtime when
they have an afternoon's
work to do.
ICU Handbook
I have just found out that
Quentin has a pile of
handbooks in his office.
These were mean't for
overseas students. If you're
an overseas student who
hasn't received a
handbook, please contact
Quentin in the Union
Office.
Council
Union Council is on
Monday at 6.15pm in the
Senior Common Room.

Dear Mr Southey,
I must disagree strongly
with your correspondent in
last week's letter column
(headed 'White Noise') I
have listened to IC Radio
quite a lot and find that
most of the shows are
pretty much the same as
each other. They play far
too much middle of the
road music; banal chart-
hyped pop, interspersed
with American-style adult
orientated rock music. The
presenters try too hard at
being slick, 'have a nice
day' disc jockeys as if
practising for a job on a
small town local radio
station.
I have only heard three
shows which go even half-
way to breaking the mould;
the John Burgess show, a
Wednesday evening show
by an American girl who
actually sounds like a
natural DJ and the 'William
and Paul Show' which
offended Mr White so
much. Admittedly the
'idiotic banter' he
complains about would
appeal best to members of
QT Soc but at least the
show has spontaneity.
Other presenters should
take note that most of their
listeners are in fact
younger than forty. We
don't all want to hear more
music and we don't always
want 'a useful and
informative service'.
Perhaps I am in a minority
of people who like to hear
a more varied selection of
music than is usually
played but minorities need
to be catered for and in any
case IC Radio needs shows
like these to at least
provide a germ of variety.
Yours sincerely
A Weston
