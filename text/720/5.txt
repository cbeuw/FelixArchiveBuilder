This week we begin with a
special request scandal for
Norman of Norman's snack
bar fame. Norman wishes it
to be known that he is
'shacked up' with Julie his
assistant. O n going to print
we could not confirm the
truth of the above (what's
new!), but it can be
revealed that this story
came straight from the
mouth of the man himself
to our illustrious editor at
the famed gathering of IC
glitterati, the Council
Sherry Party. This is
normally target number one
for all tiie Union's resident
freebie hunters eager to
drink our money. However
on this occasion one guest
actually paid for the
dubious privilege of
attending. Gallant (thicko?)
Hugh Southey in fact paid
£3 to rag. What's more,
sherry consumption was
apparently carefully
restrained by blundering
DP Dave Kingston who was
seen to hide at least 39
bottles in his office and
then declared that supplies
had run out. Eager blunder
watchers are keen to see
what sort of faux pas Dave
can accomplish with the
bottles. Surely he won't get
plastered out of his brains
just before a visit from
Sherfield supremo John
Smith, like Carl Burgess
did on Tuesday.
But to return to Dave, we
can report a couple of
recent minor blunders. On
the room bills sent out by
student services this year
there is a £15 late payment
surcharge. And who lost
the bills so that the Union
almost had to pay the
surcharge, you've guessed
it. The second minor
booboo was discovered by
scab and Dramsoc hitman
Nick Shackley who noticed
that the minutes sent out in
preparation for the Union
Finance Committee by
gormless Dave were infact
those from a prevous year.
Dave, as is his habit,
immediately insisted the
error was not his, only Nick
had the wrong minutes.
However on checking the
relevant pigeon holes the
enormity of the true error
was exposed. Dave has yet
to make the really big error
which some hacks seem to
think will lead him being no
confidenced. Perhaps this
is because the only really
big things Dave has
managed to get involved
with are women. It is nice
to see our DP's welfare
being looked after, and
who better than IC Welfare
Adviser Lesley Gillingham,
seen with the short two-
dimensional one at the
above sherry party.
Also seen getting
involved with women at the
party were rotund Hon Sec
Quentin Banana and
STOIC bighead Alan Rose
both of whom were seen to
try a patronising real man
approach. Unfortunately,
for our two heroes the
American they both chose
to force their attentions on
felt more moved towards
'duffing them up' than to
anything romantic.
Finally, in case you
haven't noticed, Union Spy
Dave Parry now workng in
Student services has been
sporting a rather novel
hairdo. Infact in the small
hours of Monday it was
extremely weird, due to the
fact that Dave and R C S
wrap around fresher Penny,
who cut it, were both under
the influence of alcohol.
Remember, just because
it's cheap doesn't mean it's
any good.
