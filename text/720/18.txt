Sir Keith Joseph, Secretary
of State for Education and
Science, was accorded a
mixed reception when he
spoke to a packed Great
Hall at a Conservative
Society meeting yesterday.
Over 500 students attended
the meeting, including a
large number who had
joined the IC Socialist
Society demonstration
outside the Great Hall
before Sir Keith arrived.
In his initial address, Sir
Keith chose to avoid the
government's education
policies and spoke instead
about the justifications'for
a capitalist economy. He
described capitalism as 'the
decentralisation of
ownership and decision-
making' which was
motivated by the pursuit of
profit. The moral
justification for this, he
continued, was that it
resulted in increased
prosperity. He agreed that
capitalism had many faults
but called it 'the least bad
system yet invented',
adding that 'economic
freedom is the basis of
political freedom'.
Sir Keith said that Britain
was now a relatively poor
country in comparison with
the rest of Europe, and that
the underlying reason for
this was that productivity is
low. He felt that concern
about unemployment was
very sincere, but that very
few people put any thought
into how jobs could be
created. Jobs, he said,
came from customers, and
to attract customers a more
stable trading base was
needed.
When the meeting was
opened to questions from
the floor, Sir Keith was
asked why France, which
has a Socialist
administration, was more
prosperous than Britain. He
replied that President
Mitterand's government
was now running a
capitalist-based economy,
and that France was
benefitting from 40 years of
capitalist rule.
The rest of the questions
concentrated on education
issues. Socsoc chairman
Pete Hobbis asked if, in the
light of generous pay
awards to senior civil
servants, teachers should
not also be treated more
favourably. Sir Keith agreed
and cited the Â£1,200 million
offer he had made to the
teachers.
Sir Keith was sceptical
when he was told that
many teachers today
actively discouraged young
people from making a
career in teaching. He said
that the real scandal in the
education system was that
one third of children left
school at the first
opportunity, after 11 years
of compulsory education
from which they had had
no apparent benefit. He
said that British education
did not cope well with
children of lower abilities.
This was partly due to an
obsolete curriculum and an
out of date exam system,
and to a small minority of
parents who discouraged
their children, but also to
sub-standard teaching. As
in any other profession,
there were good teachers
and bad teachers.
Mark Harman, chairman
of ICCND, asked Sir Keith
if he felt he had the respect
of people in education. Sir
Keith replied that he
thought of himself as being
accountable to children
who, "if they knew their
own interests, would be
favour of what I am doing."
Pole the Other One
'British physicists find
magnetic monopole' was
the title of a misleading
article which appeared in
New Scientist on 31
October. The article refers
to research by a team of
solid-state physicists, led
by Dr David Caplin of IC.
The research team
recorded an observation
consistent with the
predicted behaviour of a
monopole, the magnetic
equivalent of an electron.
The article goes on to
say that tests are still under
way to eliminate the
possibility of other physical
effects which can mimic a
monopole signal.
Monopoles are expected
to be extremely rare in
nature and are predicted in
the Grand Unified Theories.
This particular experiment
was not set up to find a
monopole, but to put an
upper limit on the densisty
of these particles in the
Universe.
David Caplin said the
article was misleading
because, contrary to what
was said in the New
Scientist, they wouldn't be
able to prove whether the
signal was a monopole or
not.
Bo Romps
home
Boanerges, the famed
inviolate mascot of City
and Guilds Union,
completed the Brighton run
last Sunday in her usual
time of just over four hours.
Ten Guildspeople, two of
whom were clad in pyjmas,
saw Bo off from the North-
west corner of the
Serpentine at 8.20am with a
feeble Boomalaka.
However, about fifty people
were in Brighton to see Bo
finish at 12.30pm.
The traditional lunch was
held in the Apollo Hotel,
Brighton. Guests of Honour
were Sir Hugh and Lady
Ford. To commemorate Sir
Hugh's fifty years of
association with Guilds,
President Roger Preece
presented him with a silver
replica of Boanerges, made
by silversmith Allen Brown
of Rugeley, Staffs.
The lunch was followed
by an invasion of the
seafront dodgems. It has
been rumoured that the
absence of Roger Preece
from the traditional Exec
swim that afternoon will be
punished by a ducking in
the round pond after the
Guilds Christmas U G M .
Welfare
ICU Welfare Officer, Pete
Wilson, is alarmed that
women are not taking
advantage of the services
offered by the Union for
their defence. He told
FELIX that few women had
taken advantage of the self
defence courses being
offered for free by the
Union. He also said that he
was worried that few
women had got their free
rape alarms from the
Union.
Any woman interested in
going on a course or taking
a rape alarm should
contact Kathy in the Union.
ACM Contest
Imperial College won the
A C M European
Programming Contest last
Saturday. IC, who were
represented by Kevin
O'Connor, Barry Sherlock,
Henry Young and Peter
Ruffhead, beat fifteen
teams from six countries.
The team will now go to
the world final in Cincinatti
in the first week of
February.
