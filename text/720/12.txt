'Elementary my
dear Publisher...'
It is obvious to the most
uncomplicated mind that a
series of stories,
concerning a pair of rather
old-fashioned characters,
which are still widely read
by the populace, must
signify a most singular
problem...
The mythology
surrounding Sherlock
Holmes is so intense that
even today people write to
him at 221B Baker Street.
For enthusiasts Penguin
have published a collection
of his correspondence, in
'Letters to Sherlock
Holmes', price £1.95, but
for the rest of us there's a
new anthology of stories.
The Further Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes is a
medley of short stories by
authors attempting to
follow Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle's style.

Most tales miss their
mark, and labour to
recreate the atmosphere of
Trained Cormorant'. These
tales exude the
characteristics of Victorian
Values; snobbishness,
prudery, greed, arrogance
and petty moralising, to a
marked degree. If you want
the real thing it may be
better to go for Conan

late Victorian London; the
smogs, the murders,
Hackney Carriages and
Turkish baths. There are a
few gems however such as
the adventures of 'the
Unique Hamlet', 'the
Marked Man' and 'the
Doyle's books, which are
published by every major
publisher and available in
most bookshops. A good
cross-section of stories is
printed in 'Selected Stories'
(published by Oxford, price
£1.95).

The guide mainly covers the
area enclosed by the circle
line. Since it is sponsored by
Kiri ('a sparkling apple juice'),
there are eighty pages trying
to persuade one to buy Kiri
with recipes for keen cooks.
The book is divided into
sections according to postal
district with maps. The layout
is very good—an easy book
to use. Unless one is a 'cafe-
crawler' its usefulness seems
rather doubtful, as most
people do not wish to venture|
too far during their
lunchhour, and tend to find a
favourite haunt very quickly.
Maybe the Haldane should
invest in a copy.

Kirk
Sherlock Holmes' career began in 'A Study In Scarlet'
where he met up with Dr Watson. Despite his creator's
efforts to kill him off in 'The Final Problem', when he was
believed to fall to his death over the Reichenbach Falls
whilst clutching his arch-enemy, Moriarty, he was
resurrected. In The Empty House', about the murder of a
gamester, he meets up with his Watson again, and due to
public pressure, another three collections of stories were
written: The Return of Sherlock Holmes', 'The Last Bow'
and 'The Casebook'.
If you thought that the
Royal Shakespeare
Company always produced
wholesome, well-mannered
plays in a wholesome, well-
mannered style, then think
again. The author of this
play does not mince words
- any writer attempting to
deal with the relationship
between sexuality and
politics could not afford to
- and this production does
not pull any punches
Ungratuitous nudity?
either. Nudity and 'bad'
language feature
prominently, but here they
are not gratuitous. Barker's
main strength is his
realistic dialogue, which is
totally convincing, from the
vulgar cynicism of the
veteran soldier to the
clipped economy of speech
of the Old Etonian.
The action takes place in
a remote British colony,
where the leisurely routine
is upset by the arrival of a
government spy, an
entrepreneur, three
prostitutes and a magician.
A rebellion follows
THEATRE
(appropriately enough, led
by the magician), and leads
to the formation of Utopia
— the New England.
Imperialism is savagely
Brave New World
caricatured, with the
portrayal of a governor
pretending to be ga-ga, his
sex-mad daughter (who
realises her sexual
monopoly has been ended
by by the arrival of the
whores when her
underwear is no longer
stolen), two pillars of the
establishment (ex-public
school, of course) sent to
restore order, and a
government official who
misses his mother.
Lawrence of Arabia even
manages to put in an
appearance as a gay
private.
As one would expect
from the R S C the acting is
excellent, with strong
performances from Maggie
Steed as the Governor's
daughter (a sort of sexually
demented Joyce Grenfell,
as City Limits put it) and
Paul Freeman as the
magician. Having seating
on two sides of The Pit
manages to capture the
atmosphere of 'in the
round' theatre while
avoiding some of the
drawbacks.
'Crimes in Hot Countries'
is extremely funny, but it is
a happy play — or even
optimistic. Barker's view of
life and humanity is a
grotesque one if his
paintings are anything to
go by, and you will emerge
from this play at best
bemused; at worst,
bewildered. Nevertheless, it
is well worth seeing, if only
to enjoy a bit of Empire-
bashing to counter the
recent wave of 'those
glorious days in India'
nostalgia.
