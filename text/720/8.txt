Jim Claydon looks
at recent cinema
releases
The American market
accounts for some 60-70% of
the total film revenue, and the
majority of the audience in
the States is aged between
15-24. These facts were
probably responsible for the
production of some recent
releases.
Starting at the least
cerebral and working
upwards, albeit slightly, we
have Weird Science (Empiri
Leicester Square. ABCs and
locals). Inspired by watching
a Frankenstein movie and by
their lack of success with
girls, a couple of 15 year-old
boys decide to create their
ideal women. They feed a
home computer with pictures
from Playboy and details of
Einstein and correct the
whole thing up to a Barbie-
doll. After some pathetic
jokes involving trying to
choose the breast size of
their creation (perhaps the
makers were aiming their film
at the untrapped 10-15 year
old market) the Barbie-doll
reappears as Kelly le Brock.
Girlfriends.
I'm afraid to have to report
that Ms le Brock probably
possessed greater acting
abilitiy before the transition,
but her heart's in the right
place as she tries hard to
supply the boys with
girlfriends of their own age.
There is one particularly
enjoyable set piece early on
when the two nervous
youngsters, accompanied by
the sophisticated Lisa, their
creation, go into the Harlem
bar and here Antony Michael
Hall's not inconsiderable
talents are allowed almost
free reign. His friend, Ian
Michael-Smith, is however
not quite so good and also
bears a disturbing similarity
to an old school friend of
mine; still that's my problem.
The film also contains an
amusing cameo role in the
form of a sadistic older
brother who is continually
beating up his sibling, 'a habit
he picked up at military
academy'. The whole thing
was fairly ably written and
directed by John Hughes,
who made the fairly
intelligent Breakfast Club and
should know better. If you
have an 11 year old liking for
bad taste jokes then this is
the film for you, but
otherwise I can't recommend
it for fear that it might do well
enough to promote a sequel,
heaven help us.
Heaven Help Us was the
American title for the film
Catholic Boys (ABC Edgware
Rd, Classic Tottenham Ct Rd)
and the film is better than
either title might suggest,
slightly.
It is a film full of
stereotypes, a bright new kid,
an intelligent lout much
teased fat boy, a sex-crazed
boy, a stupid, narcissistic lad,
a sadistic teacher, a
benevolent headmaster, an a
sympathetic trendy, new
master. The well worn story
of growing up is given a new
lease of life by the good
performances by all the
characters and the addition of
a poignant doomed love story
between the entirely
convincing Andrew McCarthy
and the independant Doris,
Mary Stuart Masterson.
Frizzy Perm
Donald Sutherland appears
briefly as the headmaster
whose small role consists
mainly of looking benignly
down from his window at his
boys from beneanth his
rather obvious perm. The film
however belongs to Andrew
McCarthy whose relaxed and
natural performance deserves
to take him far.
Interestingly enough it is
Andrew McCarthy's cynical
hack in St Elmo's Fire (Plaza
2, Screen on the Green,
Classic Chelsea) for whom I
had the most sympathy. That
having been said I really
couldn't get all that involved
with the middle class angst of
a group of 7 recent High
School graduates. It is ironic
that the title refers to a
phenomenon which appears
to be more dramatic then it
really is, and this is how the
film comes across.
The film is basically
concerned with the way in
which a group of graduates
adapt to life after college and
the way in which their
friendship changes under the
subsequent pressures. There
is some excellent acting from
the attractive cast who
obviously enjoy working
together and who should all
do well (and already are), but
their over-priviledged
characters failed to move me
Fake bars
in this picture. And I am also
sorry to have to report that I
found the assets, of the bar
particulary, looked just like
film sets and not at all real,
shame.
This problem in a different
guise is also a fault with the
otherwise excellent crafted
Prizzi's Honour (Odeon
Haymarket). It was disturbing
to find that, in a movie where
enormous attention was spent
on every detail, several
sequences contained intercut
Major Photographic Exhibition Announced
shots on noticable different
filmstock. Apart from that
John Huston's new film is
classically told, with standard
techniques, such as the use
of shots of an aeroplane
flying in the appropriate
direction every time someone
makes the transition from Los
Angeles to New York or vice
versa. Jack Nicholson
brilliantly portrays the rather
slow-witted mafia hitman who
Mafia marriage
falls in love and subsequently
marries Kathleen Turner who,
much to his surprise turns
out to be in the same line of
work. Unfortunately she has
robbed the family and this
leads Jack Nicholson to the
conflict of loyalties hinted at
by the title and hence the
rather unclassical ending.
The cast, including the 75
year old director's daughter
Angelica, is excellent,
particularly the excellent
Kathleen Turner, and the
script for this black comedy
contains many sharp lines, a
very worthwhile film.
Finally, saving the best for
last, my favourite film of
recent releases is Mishima, A
Life in Four Chapters
(Lumiere, Electric Screen). It
tells the story of one of Japan
greatest authors, he was
nominated for the Nobel Prize
three times in a brilliantly
clever form. Hampered by
condition imposed by
Mishima's widow, Paul
Schrader has constructed a
highly intelligent film. In fact
Mishima's fanatical
nationalism, unashamed
homosexuality (toned down
for the film), and the final
ritual suicide in 1975 is still
such a delicate point with the
Japanese that the film was
recently hastily withdrawn
from the Tokyo film festival
after pressure from right wing
groups.
The characters of the man
are portrayed in four parts
and in three different ways,
through black and white
flashbacks (whose character
reflect a history of Japanese
cinema) through theatrical
adaptation of sections from
four of his stories; and the
events of his final day. This
confusing sounding mixture
is so well handled that it
never seems'anything other
than wholly appropriate and
is always easily accessible.
Paul Schrader who wrote and
directed seems to have a
fascination for the obsessive
individual and is on record as
having said that had Mishima
not existed he would have
had to creat him.
The narcissism of Mishima
is conveyed but repeated use
of mirrors, both as used in
the shot in the film and also
throughout the script, for
mirrors show what 'actors
and homosexuals most fear',
themselves as they really are.
It is this obsession with self
that leads him into body
building and finally to suicide
in or-der to avoid the
degradation with age, as a
character from one of his
novels says, 'You must
commit suicide at the height
of your beauty'. Slowly
through this life he becomes
aware that in his quest for
purity that you can only
'reconcile art and actions by
death'.

BANDSBANDSBA
learning to play! In their
current incarnation Inner City
Unit have much in common
with The Cramps and their
American garbage—psycho-
punk. One of Mr Turner's
specialities in his stage act is
a mock rape act during a
cover of 'The Crusher' from
which you can gauge the
artistic nature of the show.
The only other 'cover' they
featured was their blistering
version of In The Mood,
thrashed as you have never
heard anything thrashed
before. This climaxed the
main set and should have left
the flailing around for
dead, but after a short raffle
they returned for 'Watching
Weirdo Sings the Cramps
Inner City Unit, the band
based around ex-Hawkwind
sax blower Nik Turner, played
the IC Concert Hall on
Wednesday. Their music
embodies elements of punk,
psychadelic, heavy rock and
tribal sounds. Until recently
they featured a number of
bizarre cover versions in their
act, including 'Riders onThe
Storm' and several Hawkwind
classics which they thrashed
in characteristic style.
However, on their visit to IC
the group announced to
disappointment from some
of the audience that they
were on another of their anti-
Hawkwind stints. The current
tour seems to mark a
conscious effort to go
commercial with their own
sound. One dedicated fan
seemed to be of the opinion
that they had sold out by
The Grass Grow'.
In breaking out of the pub
circuit Inner City Unit have
lost some of the atmosphere
they used to charge through
their gigs. But at the same
time they have put together a
gut blasting show and a good
album which should give
them some deserved success.
Siouxsie and the Banshees
continued their successful
Iter Brittaniae (British Tour)
at Hammersmith Odeon last
Friday week.
After dislocating her knee
on the previous night,
Siouxsie had to be carried on
and propped up by a stool for
the entire concert. This lack
of mobility did not affect her
performance and they
started well with Dazzle and
Cascade.
The light show was
excellent and added to the
electric atmosphere when
they performed some old
favourites like Happy House,
Arabian Nights, Melt and
Christine, and as an encore
they did Israel and the new
single Cities In Dust
(currently whizzing up the
charts) which went down as
well as the older tracks.
It was a very enjoyable
concert and they will be well
worth seeing again when they
conclude the British Tour at
the Royal Albert Hall on
November 28th.
