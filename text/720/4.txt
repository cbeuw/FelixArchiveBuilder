Soaked With A
Loving Kiss
Another letter signed 'The
Phantom Soaker' was sent
to the FELIX Office this
week. The handwriting is
different from the one
received previously. In it,
the culprit claims to have
soaked fifty people, not
thirty as reported last week.
He ridicules the efforts
which were supposedly
made by security to catch
him, and claims to have
stopped drenching people
until Tuesday 19 November
when he threatens to soak
five victims.
Chief Security Officer
Geoff Reeves was initially
reluctant to say whether his
officers had indulged in
any of the activities
mentioned in the letter.
Later he said that
someone had been posted
at the bottom of the Nat
West steps and given the
manpower, he might have
guarded the lavatories.
Mr Reeves believes the
letters were written by the
same person. He claimed
that he has several leads
but was unwilling to
discuss them.
Tuesday 19 November
should reveal all!
Donate
Or Else
The V & A museum has
introduced voluntary
charges in a controversial
move which has angered
many of the museum's staff
and trade unions.Although
described as voluntary
charges, the museum now
has 5 manned cash
registers, with a
'recommended donation' of
£2 for adults and 50p for
students. Since Monday the
museum has been picketed
by it's own employees,
giving out 'I didn't pay at
the V & A ' stickers in
obvious reply to the orange
'conscience' badges give by
the museum to those who
pay.
The move attracted a
blaze of publicity on
Monday with few people
paying, but as the week has
worn on the number of
non-paying visitors has
decreased.
Rag Queen?
Members of RCS managed
to raise £173.54 last
Tuesday, selling copies of
the IC Rag Mag at Sussex
University, despite local
hostility. On arrival the IC
students were informed by
a group of five Sussex
students that ICU endorse
the position of Rag Queen,
and Pro-vivisection
because of their choice of
'Cancer Research' as a Rag
Charity. ICU President Carl
Burgess has denied all
knowledge of a Rag Queen
at Imperial College. Jackie
Pierce, Vice President of
RCS, told FELIX that the
trip had been worthwhile,
and expressed her
disappointment that no
students turned up to
participate in a similar trip
arranged for Wednesday
afternoon.

Hordes of policemen
converged on the Holland
Club in the Huxley building
last Friday. Violence broke
out when a gang began
fighting on the walkway
outside the club. Two of
the combatants gate-
crashed the club's
Halloween Party and
caused a disturbance when
they tried to snatch the
cues from a group of pool
players, apparently
intending to use the cues
as weapons. In the struggle
that followed a girl playing
pool was hit over the head
with a cue. The police were
called in by security, and
six police vehicles arrived.
Four people were arrested,
but police have refused to
comment on the incident.
Dig, Dig, Dig
The proposals to remove
gravel from Harlington
sports ground look set to
be finalised by the end of
the month. In a meeting
between College officials
and IC Union on Friday
afternoon, a large
document was presented,
outlining the plans of
Henry Streeter (Sand and
Ballast) Ltd. The company
will start renting the ground
from IC next Easter, with
work commencing in July.
This will result in £1-2
million revenue to the
College over 8 years.
The Union has been told
that the present tennis
courts will not be used to
store topsoil. However,
A C C Chairman Simon
Errington is worried that
there will be insufficient
space to include two
proposed cricket pitches in
the renovated sports
ground.
Big Turnout
IC students turned out in
considerable force for last
Saturday's Anti-Apartheid
march. The biggest Anti-
Apartheid demonstration
ever seen in this country
began with three marches
starting from Kennington,
Tower Hill and Hyde Park,
all converging on Trafalgar
Square for a mass rally.
The organisers claimed a
turnout of 140,000 bettering
even the CND march a
fortnight ago. Speeches
were heard from Oliver
Tambo, president of the
ANC, and the Rev Jesse
Jackson, American
Presidential candidate, as
well as British political
figures. The Imperial
contingent reached
Trafalgar Square in time for
only a couple of the
speakers as many other
marchers wanted to linger
in Whitehall.
Welfare
Rape Alarms available for free from the
Deputy President's office. Use one. Be
safe.
The Police are running self-defence
courses at College for women. These
courses are useful and free. Contact
Kafhy in the Union Office for details.
