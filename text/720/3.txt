Wrongs
Dear Sir,
It was with some disgust
that I read the Editorial in
last week's FELIX,
concerning the 'picket' of
Sir Keith Joseph's visit to
Imperial College. To say
that it was one-sided would
be a gross understatement.
Why were we being urged
to participate in the
Socialist Society's
subversive and destructive
activities? Why were we not
urged to go to the meeting
and actually listen to what
the man had to say, so we
could make up our own
minds about the subject of
education policy?
I was even more
disgusted to find that the
so-called 'picket' was
included in the 'What's On'
feature. I might not have
minded so much if it had
been made totally clear that
it had been organised by
the Socialist Soc, but it
seems they don't want to
own up to indulging in this
sort of activity. (Their name
did not even appear on the
'Picket' posters). I wish
they could think of
something more
constructive to do than
Bad Taste
Sir,
I am writing to express
public concern over the
poster of the Guilds U G M
(Oct 29) which portrays a
man hung vertically by the
wrists. This was no doubt
meant in good humour but is
another example of the bad
taste which is sometimes
found around College.
For the information of
those responsible for
designing the poster,
suspension from the wrists
results in death in
approximately one hour
from asphixiation (as
crucifixion does in a longer
time). A common form of
torture is to suspend the
victim until consciousness
is lost (often from hot water
pipes) and then repeat the
treatment.
I would request that there
should be a higher general
awareness of what happens
in the outside world before
people make tasteless
blunders like this.
Yours truly

One final point. ICU
claims to be apolitical, so
why has it got a leftist

Dear- Sir,
Your editorial last week
assumes an objective view,
and includes a request to
readers to 'join the Soc Soc
picket'. It should be
stressed that in fact this
view, your own view, is
subjective to your own
politics.
I believe, as do many other
Conservatives, that this
Government's education
policy, and the record of
Sir Keith Joseph, have both
been exemplary. Its only
shortcomings, in my view,
are its failure to reinstate
grammar schools, and its
failure to remove the
Student Union closed shop
which condemns thousands
of students to
'representation' by NUS.
Its achievements include
maintaining the rights of
parents to choose how they
believe their children will
be best educated, bring
spending on education into
line with what the nation
can afford, and then
reintroducing the idea of
Bored
Dear Hugh,
I note with deep disgust
that not only did you fail to
print my original submitted
sports report, which I
would maintain is of
considerably more interest
to more students (ie most
of those resident in Evelyn
Gardens) than the C N D
Demonstration to which
you assigned the front
page, in part (well, judging
by the turnout from IC), but
you also failed to print my
letter complaining of this.
Instead the letters page
was filled this week by
letters which, judging by
the titles you ascribed to
them, you found as boring
as I did. The letters also
tended to sport the same
names as usual. Is it only
those people who wish to
publicise themselves by
having public slanging
matches through the letters
page who stand any
chance of being heard?
Yours still disgruntled.

'value for money' which
under Socialist
Governments seems to be
forgotten.
More money would have
been available for
education if alternative
methods of student finance
could have been
investigated. To say that
'the government has
decided to spend money on
defence rather that
education', distorts the
commitment of any
government, to both defend
and educate the people,
with the obvious priority on
defence.
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,
If democratic processes
had the potential of solving
South Africa's problem,
then South Africans would
have achieved the freedom
they are still fighting for
decades ago.
In his letter last week, Mr
Brown expressed his views
about this moral issue in
political terms pointing a
finger at 'Non-democratic'
politics. If he is really
fighting for democracy, let
him give the democracy to
others as much as to
himself!
The South African
apartheid regime is no less
than an oppressive
dictatorship and every
thinking human being must
fight against it and unless
democracy is to be re-
defined, I see no
connection between it and
the politics of South Africa.
Although I do not
condone violence, what
else could be done, when
the oppressed people of
South Africa don't even
have the right to vote?
The people of South
Africa have to use violence
to dismantle apartheid for
the same reason that the
West had to use violence to
destroy Nazism, which is
the other face of the same
coin. There is no alternative
to consider.
No matter how old the
foundation of apartheid lies
in South Africa, it is in my
opinion, only an empty
illusion to think that the
system will rule the
overwhelming majority of
the people for ever, it is
only a factor of time and
time will tell.
