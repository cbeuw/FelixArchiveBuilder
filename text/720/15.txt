Rugby
Kent Univ 2nd 3 IC 14
If Ron Atkinson thinks he
has injury worries he
should join the IC 2nd
team; resources were
stretched to the point
where the wingers
consisted of a limping lock
forward and a horrendously
herpes-ridden prop!
Moreover with a mixed start
to the season, everybody
knew that a victory was
essential to prevent the
season sinking into
mediocrity.
During the first half IC's
pack began to assert
themselves, and the steady
stream of possession was
used to good advantage by
the half-backs. It therefore
came as no surprise when
after a searing run by
Simon Denyer, the full-
back, Roy, scored a try.
Later following sustained
pressure by the forwards,
Andy Coope added another
try to make the score 8-3 at
half time.
The second half
performance was even
more convincing, with the
pack ably led by 'Baboon'
Downing totally dominating
the opposition, whilst the
backs continued to be solid
in defence. That IC scored
only one more try was
slightly disappointing, but
the sight of Jason hurtling
down the wing to score
was well worth the wait.
Golf
IC 4 Kent 2
The IC golf team showed
great signs of team work
under pressure.
Mark Cox having played
some magnificent shots
totally outclassed his
opponent on the putting
green and put IC 1-0 up.
But disaster struck and
both John Gamblin and
Jeff Morris lost heavily.
These three peering
through the darkness with
pints in their hands
witnessed amazing revivals
by Dave Lang and John
Jakubovic both playing like
blind sheep to start with;
obviously to lull their
opponents into a false
sense of security, came
back magnificently. Now IC
were 3-2 up and assured of
a draw but could they wih?
Somewhere Tierney
ruthlessly ground his
opponent to dust and with
that Kent University as well.

Last weekend the club
competed in two events;
Henley Sculls Hd on the
Saturday and Watney Fours
Hd on the Sunday.
Henley Sculls Hd had an
entry of over two hundred,
and Imperial had eleven
scullers racing in six
different divisions. There
were two division wins;
one in Senior C and one in
Womens open. The
placings of IC scullers in
men's Elite, Senior A senior
B and Junior events where
we had four second places
ensured that we won the
team prize. The team prize
together with overall
finishing places of second
and fourth and five scullers
in the top seventeen in

such a well attended and
high standard event
emphasises the success the
sculling squad had.
At Watney Fours Hd we
had three crews entered
and as the race is
considered a warm up for
the Four Hd on the 9
November all crews clearly
wanted a good row. The
results couldn't really have
been more encouraging, as
all three crews won their
respective divisions namely
Elite 4, Senior A 4 and
Senior B 4. The overall
placings of 1st, 3rd and 6th
were just what was hoped
for with Four Hd to come.
The total of six wins in one
weekend this early in the
year is the best the club
has had in recent years.

Ten Pin
Bowling
Portsmouth Poly 9 - IC 1
Saturday lunchtime saw
the affluent Imperial Ten
Pin Bowling team setting
off for Tolworth in a
convoy of cars for their
home UAU match against
Portsmouth Poly.
Unfortunately the tone for
the day was set early on by
Tasos Apostolit's Cortina
which dropped it's exhaust
on the A3. and by the Vice
Captain's Beetle which had
to be push-started
everywhere. If we'd been
allowed to use all of our
players we might have
done better but a mix up
over the rules meant that
we had bought five bowlers
to each of Portsmouth's
four. High level
negotiations put one of the
spare blokes in the ladies
team and the other two
spent the day swapping in
and out of C team. The
management would like to
apologise for any
inconvenience caused.
The A team had the best
day even without El
Capitano Chris and
excellent performances by
Eric Barfield and Benito
Kwok in their first game
followed by consistent
scoring in the next two
gave IC their only point of
the match.
The B team was a
disaster area with three
players going 'sub-100' in
various game and only
Tasos' reputation remaining
unblemished (despite
worries about getting
nicked in the Thunderdome
Cortina on the way home).
The C team had to do
some shuffling of players to
give all of the overstaffed
IC squad a game but they
managed well, doing much
better than the
embarrassed B's, and took
one game from the boys
from Pompey.
The ladies (and the one
lucky lad) had no chance
against Portsmouth's ringer
(an ex-world champion I
think they said) but black
sheep Ros Mueller, drafted
in at the eleventh hour,
managed a good 122 in her
third game (making the B
team sick as parrots).
The final score was
Portsmouth 9 Imperial 1,
which makes a change
from 10-0. Thanks to
everyone for turning up
and just wait for the
rematch!
