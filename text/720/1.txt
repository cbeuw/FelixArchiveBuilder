College Gives Go-ahead for Bar Take-over
You Can Have It
IC Union will begin a phased takeover of the Union bar
on January 1 1986. Proposals outlined in a joint paper by
College Secretary John Smith and Union President Carl
Burgess were approved at the meeting of House
Committee on Wednesday.
The paper was submitted
without any alterations to the
original draft copy written by Mr
Smith. This was sent to Mr
Burgess for his approval, as
reported in FELIX on 25
October. Mr Burgess arranged
the inaugural meeting of the
Union Planning Group on
Thursday October 31, at which
the proposals for the bar
takeover were discussed.
Several senior non-sabbatical
Union officers who were
present expressed concern over
the wording of the draft
document and advised changes.
Mr Burgess appeared to agree
to these suggestions and he
was expected to have amended
the document prior to
Wednesday's House Committee.
When the matter was discussed
at the UGM on Tuesday, Mr
Burgess revealed that he had
chosen not to implement any of
the recommended changes.
Mr Burgess was criticised
from the floor for not making
any mention of the takeover
proposals, and specifically Mr
Smith's draft paper, in his report
to the U G M . Mr Burgess
claimed that he had only had
the draft in his possession for
two days before writing his
report: he did not include
Saturday and Sunday. After an
objection the President's report
was passed by a narrow
majority.
Mr Burgess and Deputy
President Dave Kingston were
interviewed by FELIX after the
Kingston: 'Phantom Fears'
House Committee meeting on
Wednesday. Both expressed
disappointment in the general
reaction to the moves to take
over the bar. Mr Burgess
stressed that the Union
Planning Group was only an
advisory body, and as such
could not decide Union policy.
He was disappointed that many
students who attended had had
too negative an attitude towards
the Union takeover. He felt that
the meeting had provided lots
of questions but no answers,
and the plans for the bar had
not been advanced. Mr
Kingston said that the fears
which had been expressed were
justifiable but were 'phantom
fears'.
Mr Burgess and Mr Kingston
felt confident that the Union
would be ready to begin a
takeover on January 1. They
had brought the matters raised
at the meeting to the attention
of College administration, and
had been assured that these
were not causes for concern.
They had also spoken at some
length with Mr Peter Anwyl,
senior administrator at ULU,
who has made several reports
on bar practice.
Mr Burgess added that he
was disappointed in the turnout
at the Union Planning Group,
and was unhappy that his
notice about the meeting had
not been printed in FELIX. He
was critical of the Editor, Hugh
Southey, and stressed that
FELIX has a responsibility to
the Union. 'A Union notice is for
the FELIX Editor to publish' was
his comment.
When questioned about his
statement that he had only had
Mr Smith's draft paper for two
days before the deadline for his
U G M report, Mr Burgess said
that he had meant 'two days in
which he had any spare time'.
He pointed out how many other
things he had to do, and how
busy Commemoration Day
week had been. He had only
had ten minutes to write his
report and had not thought of
including the paper as part of
this.
John Smith spoke to FELIX
about the takeover proposals
later on Wednesday. He said
|
Burgess: chose not to implement
changes
that he and Mr Burgess still had
to discuss many of the details
before the phased takeover
began. He said that it was
expected that the Union would
take financial responsibility for
the bar as of January 1, but that
Mr Iwen Thomas and Mr Rob
Northey, the current licensees,
would still be involved in the
management organisation. He
felt that it would be wisest for
the Union to obtain a corporate
legal identity, in order to get a
liquor license, rather than to
apply for a club license. He
thought that it would be 'easier
for the Union to fight its own
battles' if it were legally
separate from the College.
Union Bar
Trashed
The Union Bar was vandalised
sometime on Monday night. The
damage was discovered at
about 8.30am Tuesday morning
when acting bar manager Dave
Brennan arrived to open the Bar
for a stock check. The police
were called and arrived at about
10.30am.
Refectory Manager Rob
Northey told FELIX that the cost
of the damage had been initially
assessed at Â£800 but declined
to comment further. Head of
College security, Geoff Reeves,
later stated that the matter was
in the hands of the police who
had questioned a man in
connection with the enquiries.
At Tuesday's U G M Carl
Burgess warned that when the
vandals were caught, they
would oe prosecuted and
thrown out of College.
