IC 1 X V 9 Esher U21 15
Despite the apparent sJjgrtgJie of players on
the coach a full team was eventually fielded
against a very large U21 side. The game
anthemed the return of M Windsor in a new
role as stand-off. Despite the lack of
familiarity with the position Windsor pro-
duced a competent performance the highlight
of which was a well wotked drop goal which
brought Jason close rer fears. Other fine
performances stemmed frorn Pete Hagger
and Simon (I want _.ajn early shower)
Downing.
Overall the team produced a fine per-
formance especially ' the forwards who
performed excellently in the scrums and
would have rucked effectively had the referee
allowed them. Despite the fact that some
players, including some senior players,
decided to return to Hammersmith.
IClst X V vs Esher
Having been warned that it may well turn out
to be the hardest match of the season, it was
quite a relief to discover that Esher weren't
quite as good as expected. This made for a
fairly even match, with IC having the better of
the first half. At orange-time we were 9-3 up.
The highlight of the first half was Chris
Carter getting poked in the eye by one of his
own players, resulting in D C McGee yet
again moving into his favourite position in
the front row. However, Dave was consoled
by the fact that the rest of the team agreed
that his lightning speed merited a position in
the front row.
The second half saw Esher coming back
into the game, and they were leading by 10-9
(or 14-9, depending on who was counting)
when the match was stopped due to the
unfortunate injury of one of their props.
'Daddy' Davies tried to steal the limelight by
announcing that he, too, was injured.
However, this had all been heard before, so
no attention was paid.
Esher did offer to finish the game (the last
12 minutes?) under floodlight at their
grounds some time next term— we all look
forward to that.
Talk in the bar afterwards revolved around
Mark Hipsey's beautiful new hairstyle/black
eye combination and about how the
enthusiasm of the more hardy members of the
club appears to have petered out. At this
thought, everyone sighed with resignation.

IC vs Brunei 1-0
On arrival at Datchet Water we found the
lake covered in fog and absolutely no wind.
Whereas the fog did finally clear (with help
from a low fly past by Concord) all attempts
to get the wind to appear failed. As Caroline
refused to do her wind dance around the
Christmas tree the team set off for a calm,
gentle and very slow drift on the lake, under
these conditions strange forces start to work,
while Andy and Caroline found they couldn't
slow down, Phil and Alison's boat decided to
go backwards around the wrong side of the
gybe mark. The team however managed to
pull off yet another victory.
After a break for lunch a 'no olds barred'
(ie you can cheat) race was held. Richard and
Pete took this to mean that you didn't have to
round the marks of the course; just sink the
opposition.
C r i c k e t
us from repeating previous night's runner.
By the way, lost to Britannia Naval College.

Eastland scored 100 not out versus Plymstock
in a match which IC contrived to lose by 8
wickets. Much beers consumed in the eve-
ning, exemplified by the various odours per-
colating around the breakfast table the fol-
lowing morning.
Idiot of the day went to Shaw who walking
out of the hotel entrance trod on the next
day's breakfast. Scrambled eggs again, boys!

Piss-up match versus Babbacombe, lots of
beers followed by silly games followed by lots
of beers followed by altercation with blue
uniformed gentlemen.
Garrod and 5 wickets and birthday equals
pissed person.
Bell and first fifty of season and bottle of
whiskey equals very pissed person.
