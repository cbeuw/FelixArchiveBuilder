It's not as easy
as you think!
I expect most people already know the
rules of draughts, but in case you never
learned to play, or need to be reminded,
here they are.
Draughts is played on the dark squares of
the board, but for clarity the problems are
shown with the pieces on the white squares.
The playing squares are numbered from 1 to
32 as shown in fig. I. At the start, black
occupies squares 1 to 8 with single pieces
and white has squares 25 to 32. Singles are
only allowed to move forward in diagonal
steps of one (like a pawn's capturing move
in chess). However, singles capture a piece
by jumping over it (not landing on it)
providing that there is a clear square to land
on. If, after capture, there is another piece
which can be captured, that is taken too. In
fact, the player must capture any piece
which he can take. (In the event of a player
having two pieces which can both capture
opposing pieces, he is allowed to choose
which one to move.) When a single reaches
the far side of the board (squares 1 to 4 for
white-this is known as black's crownhead)
the single is crowned with another single,
and becomes a king. The king can move
forwards or backwards in diagonal one-
steps.
The object, of course, is to capture all
your opponents' pieces.
In the solutions, each move is written with
the starting and finishing positions joined by
a dash, eg 1-5. However, this may involve
Fig 1 — draughts board numbering
zigzagging round the board, capturing lots
of pieces in one move. Problems with
solutions which involve lots of capturing are
called strokes. There are also problems
which end in forced stalemates.
Finally, do not despair if you have no
draughts pieces; use chess pawns as singles
and other chess pieces as kings. Have fun!

The game
of draughts
Draughts (also known as checkers in the
US) is a game often thought to be trivially
easy by people who have played it, but
know little about it. The fact that it is much
simpler than chess does not detract from
the fact that it is a challenging and subtle
game when played at top level. Reports of
computer programs that have draughts
completely analysed have been disproved
by draughts experts.
Interest in draughts is worldwide and
a c t i v i t y is e q u a l l y d i v i d e d b e t w e e n
tournaments and the invention and solution
of problems. As with chess, problems can
involve starting positions which are unlikely
to arise in play, but the solutions are
ingenious and entertaining.
