remains that in the four terms the
College has had the Fremantle
H o t e l a t o t a l of seven
appointments have been made to
the four posts that have existed at
various times without any of the
posts ever being advertised or
interviews held. There is no
regulation which states that any
procedure must be followed, and
in practice the appointments
have all been made by the Union
President on the recommodation
of Michael Arthur.
CCUs
Slated
The Constituent College Unions
( C C U s ) were described as
'ineffective organisations' by the
Rag Committee Chairman,
James Benbow, this week.
Reaction was quick to come
from the CCUs, with all three
Vice-Presidents claiming that
while they had arranged all last
term's Rag events, M r Benbow
had taken all the money for I C U
Rag.

College Falling Down
The College is unable to afford
basic maintenance on its
buildings as a result of spending
cuts according to the governors.
As a result replacement of ageing
lifts, heating systems, etc is being
phased over several years, whilst
general maintenance such as
painting has virtually stopped.
The problems at Imperial were
a major part of a front cover story
in the Times Higher Education
Supplement recently, where
i n c r e a s i n g c o n c e r n o v e r
'crumbling universities' was
highlighted. IC's governors are
quoted as saying that 'insufficient
resources can be devoted
generally to maintain premises to
a proper standard'.
The College is finding it
increasingly difficult to find
money for the replacement of
worn out equipment and
structures. Recent examples are
the long delay in replacing the
telephone system and the
difficulty in financing the repairs
to the Electrical Engineering
b u i l d i n g . A n d because of
f i n a n c i a l c o n s t r a i n t s the
Southside heating system has had
to be replaced gradually over
four years, ending this summer,
whilst the cycle of periodic
repainting of all buildings has
been abandoned.
The College is concentrating
only on repairs necessary for
health and safety reasons, but
the result of this will be
i n c r e a s i n g u n r e l i a b i l i t y of
b u i l d i n g plant a n d general
deterioration of structures. M r
John Lauwerys, Senior Assistant
Secretary, expressed concern that
lack of maintenance would cause
a danger of more expenditure in
the f u t u r e as b u i l d i n g s
deteriorated more rapidly.
Paid in
Blood
O n . Wednesday 11 January,
Mary, the wooden leopard mas-
cot of Q M C Students' Union was
returned to its rightful owners
after 22 months of tense and
sometimes bitter negotiation be-
tween them and R C S U who
purloined the model in March
1982.
The swap took place outside
Senate House in Bloomsbury,
R C S U exchanging the leopard in
return for a receipt showing that
Q M C students had donated over
80pts of blood in a special session
last term and cheque for £40.

Showers?
The College has agreed to spend
£4000 installing showers for the
volleyball court in the old chem-
istry building. Two mens and two
ladies showers will be installed in
the existing changing rooms.
The room, a former lab, was
converted into a gym two years
ago, but until now only basic
changing facilities have been
available. The job is expected to
be started this term but, due to
the lack of a hot water supply to
the changing rooms, it is expected
to take longer than would
normally be the case for such an
installation. No firm date for
completion has been set.

Bang, Bang You're Dead
Three IC students appeared at
the Crown Court in Preston last
week, charged with assault. They
were arrested while motoring to
the Lake District last February
after an incident involving a toy
cap pistol, as reported in F E L I X
no 637.
When a lorry pulled out in
front of them on the M6, one of
the students wound down the car
window and 'shot' the lorry
driver. He reported a shooting
incident to the police who later
intercepted the car as it left the
motorway.
Carl Fairhurst, Tony Collier
and Julian Barber, together with
Martin White from Cambridge,
were initially charged with a
breach of the peace. They sub-
sequently appeared at Blackpool
Magistrate's Court where they
pleaded not guilty, and were
committed for trial at the Crown
Court.
Charges against White, who
was asleep when the incident
occured, were later dropped and
the charge against the other three
was changed to assault.
The three IC students ap-
peared at Preston Crown Court
on 3 January when the case
against Barber and Fairhurst
was dismissed. Collier, who
changed his plea to guilty, was
given a 12 month conditional
discharge. He receives no crim-
inal record.
