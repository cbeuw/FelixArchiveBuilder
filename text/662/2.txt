Union
Slush Fund
Dear Sir
You state in the Editorial of
the Christmas issue that
'Sundry Expenses' in the Union
budget is "basically the Presi-
dent's slush fund...do with what
she wants to." That is the kind
of misrepresentation which the
Union could do without.
Among the larger sums
debited to this item recently are:
£300—subscription to London
Student; £218—hire of tables
for Freshers' Fair; and £88—
transport for Silwood students
to Freshers' Day. This term's
Union officer elections will take
at least £250; and the cost of
sending you on a typing course
at the start of the .session was
£96. The merits or otherwise of
such items can be argued, but
they are evidently not the
waggons of some presidential
gravy train. For its outlay on
the F E L I X editorship (well
over £5,000pa) and the total
cost of F E L I X (around
£30,000pa), the Union should
receive fairer and more accurate
comment, both on finance and
other topics.
Yours faithfully

Ed's Note: Any one of the three
sabbaticals can authorise expen-
diturefrom the sundries account
without any student or student
committee knowing about it: not
even the Union Finance Commit-
tee which is the elected student
body supposedly responsible for
Union expenditure. All other club
and CCU expenditure is scru-
pulously monitored, why on
earth should the Union Office be
an exception?
The offical line is that the
sundries account is there to adda
little 'flexibility' into the Union
accounting system. Most of the
expenditure is without doubt
quite valid and legitimate.
Nevertheless it is open to abuse.
You know as well as I do. Ken,
that the amount spent on so
called 'entertainments' in the
Union Office last year ran well
into three figures.
I don't know what you'dcall it,
but I'd call it a slushfund. That is
the kind of misappropriation the
Union could do without.
Dear Pallab
I feel that it is about time
there was some debate in
F E L I X about the low priority
some lecturers give to under-
gratduates. Many students have
had tutorials cancelled or have
been unable to find their
laboratory supervisor because
the member of staff is working
on his research. This is en-
couraged by the promotion
system that usually rewards
good research and not good
teaching ability. Maybe there
should be some form of bonus
for the good teachers. I am not
saying that all our courses are
not of a high standard, just that
they could be improved.

All Hours
Sir
It would appear that the
opening hours of the Union
Office are in something of a
decline. For two afternoons,
just after the end of last term,
anyone trying to make use of
the place found it locked. Of
course, I am sure that the
considerable quantities of wine
consumed in there during these
afternoons were not purchased
at the Union's expense.

Dear Pallab
I wonder if any of your
readers have noticed the resem-
blance between C & G President
Mike Stewart and actress Lilly
Langtry. Is there any relation-
ship. I think we should be told.

Dear Editor
Since arriving at Imperial I
have been amazed at the low
standard of service in what
appears to be one of England's
foremost banks, the National
Westminster. This bank is
allowed to occupy a privileged
position on campus, and many
students open accounts with the
branch for this reason alone.
Apart from student accounts,
the NatWest also seems to get
all the other College and Union
banking business. In return for
this, they give ordinary students
a service which is inefficient,
reluctant, forgetful, unenthusi-
stic and even indiscreet.
Let me quote my experiences
at Edinburgh University for
comparison. Edinburgh has
twice as many students as
Imperial, spread over two sites.
There are four branches of the
three major Scottish banks and
three automatic cash machines.
On these statistics, NatWest
should have at least one on-site
competitor, perhaps in the
Union Building or Southside.
When I was at Edinbrugh, I
was fortunate enough to be a
client of the Clydesdale Bank,
where I found quick, friendly,
efficient and enthusiastic ser-
vice. In addition, the
Clydesdale is one of the most
modern banks in the country:
the Autobank" cash dispensing
system allows customers to pay
in cheques and transfer money
inside the bank using their
cashcard and without the need
for the mess of form-filling
which the NatWest seems to
delight in.

Naturally, as Alternative
Prospectus Editor, I intend to
provide information and advice
on banking for prospective
freshers. If anyone has any
comments, views or experiences
with the NatWest or any other
bank, I will be pleased to hear
them, messages can be left c/o
the F E L I X Office.

Arrogant IC
Dear Pallab
The question of sending
visitors from Imperial College
to the NUS conference raises
wider issues than whether the
expenditure of £200 of Union
money is justified.
Whether we like it or not,
NUS makes decisions which
affect students at Imperial
College. Although we may
choose to remain unaffiliated to
NUS, it surely makes sense to at
least reopen the dialogue with
them. Nothing is to be gained
from an arrogant "they can't
help us" type attitude.Delegates
from many colleges with differ-
ing opinions and ideas attend
the conference, and discussion
of issues of far more immediate
concern to students than na-
tional politics takes place. By
deciding not to send visitors to
the conference, IC Union has
wasted a golden opportunity to
learn from these discussions.
The cost of sending visitors to
Blackpool amounts to less than
0.1% of the Union's subvention
from College. Ironically, the
money 'saved' is unlikely to be
spent for the benefit of students.
I suspect it will lie idle in the
budgets set aside for campaigns
and contingency funds, and
remain unused.
By refusing to send visitors to
the NUS confs'-ence, Imperial
College Union has lost a great
deal of potential good will. For
how much longer will we let our
hearts rule our heads to our
detriment?
Yours sincerely
