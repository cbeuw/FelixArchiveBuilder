On 17 November Sir Keith
Joseph, Secretary of State for
Education and Science,
announced that £90m is going to
be cut from the education budget
over the next three years. Student
grants will be increased by 4%
next year. This is more than the
public sector pay figure of 3%,
however taking inflation into
account it means that students
will once again face a cut in their
grants in real terms. Sir Keith
also announced that the parental
contribution scale is to be ad-
justed to increase contributions
from those parents with residual
incomes in the middle and upper
reaches of the scale, and that the
minimum grant is to be halved.
'Revised arrangements' for re-
payment of travelling costs are to
be announced later.
The effect of removing the
travel allowance will be (or so the
Government hopes) to induce
students to live in their parents
home and attend Colleges within
reasonable distance to this.
Why should I care?
Future cuts in education spend-
ing are going to hurt you! They're
going to reduce your grant, place
your job at risk, eat away at your
facilities and equipment. Young
people (your brothers and sisters)
hoping to go to college will find
the door being slammed in their
faces. Your parents will have to
pay more for your education.
And, in the long run, the
economy will only suffer if people
cannot cope with new tech-
nology. Unemployment and
slower growth will mean a lower
standard of living for you in the
future.
What does this mean to^students?
If you receive full grant, you will
only receive an extra £80 in next
year's grant. This works out at
less than 30p more per day.
Those students whose parents
have a residual income of more
than about £12,000pa (about
50% of students at IC) will have
to sponge even more money from
them than at present.
Perhaps the most alarming
aspect of Sir Keith's statement is
his plan to change the method of
meeting our additional travel
costs. It is widely expectded that
the present method of full
repayment will be replaced by a
flat rate travel allowance.
This would mean that if, for
instance, you lived in one of the

Sir Keith Joseph is committed to axing £90m from
the Education budget over the next three years, a ques-
tionnaire has been sent out to all universities to consider
possible cuts in resources of 1-2% per student a year.
In the first of a series of articles, Peter Burt examines the
long term implications of these cuts and the effect they
will have on you now.
more remote parts of the country
or travelled daily by tube into
College, you would be expected
to heavily subsidize the fares
from your own pocket.
What of the future?
The Government is committed to
maintaining a constant level of
public expenditure until 1987,
and this will probably mean that
education spending will suffer in
this period.
current contraction of the poly-
technics. A major questionnaire
from the University Grants Com-
mittee (the body which, among
other things, supervises the dis-
tribution of funds to the univer-
sities) recently asked the univer-
sities to consider the effects of
possible future cuts in resources
per student of l-2%pa, although
Sir Keith Joseph has statea^j^j*
there is no present int
students in further education
colleges receive no grant at all,
and that mature students who
may have to leave a job to take
their course will have additional
needs.
Ideally the system of student
financial support would even-
tually be reformed to encompass
all these needs. However, there is
obviously a major catch. All this
would cost a lot of money.
Given the general contempt
with which students are held,
neither the Government or elec-
torate are likely to advocate
spending money to increase
student grants. A l l that we can do
at present about this is to point
out the importance of education
d. the crucial need for highly
graduates for the long
FELIXl
Mr Peter Brooke, the Minister
responsible for Higher Education
has told students that 'the
hatches are battened down' and it
would be 'wholly incorrect' for
students to expect significant
improvements in living standards
in the future. M r Brooke 'recog-
nises the illegality and unfairness
of the parental contribution
system' but, as we have seen, has
no plans for phasing it out.
Furthermore, the Department of
Education and Science has not
yet considered possible transfer
of funds from other Government
departments and administrative
savings to offset the cost of any
improvements.
All this must be seen in the
light of possible cutbacks for the
universities themselves following
to implement such a policy.*
Such politics would nardly
increase educational opportuni-
ties or the quality of education
received by students. They may
also force universities to increase
hall and refectory charges to a
greater degree than otherwise,
and introduce library fees and
suchlike, thus hitting students'
pockets even harder.
The alternative
Few students would object if
their grants were to be increased
to a realistic level and maintained
at this level. In the eyes of the law,
students over the age of 18 are
independent adults, and it would
seem reasonable to reflect this by
gradually abolishing the parental
contribution. We must also re-
member that a great many
term economic well-being of the
country.
What can I do?
This term, Imperial College
Union will be running a cam-
paign directed towards putting
our case about grants and
education policy over. We hope
to organise a letter-writing cam-
paign to MPs, possibly supported
by other events to demonstrate
our concern.
You can participate by writing
to your M P (details from I C U
Office), telling your parents and
other interested parties what it
means to them, and finding out
more by participating in any
events organised.
