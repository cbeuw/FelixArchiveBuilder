Open at Last!
Bad Guy Makes Good
The Bot/Zoo Common Room tea service reopened for business last
Monday after ten months closure. Professor Wood, Head of the Biology
Department, said that he is now able to redistribute departmental funds
to allow two half-time appointments to be made.
This week the service has been
open in the mornings only but,
from next week there will be an
afternoon service as well.
The tea room closed last
March when the College freeze
on recruitment left the depart-
ment too short staffed to run the
service. Last term there was a
growing campaign to have it re-
opened led by Tim Wilson, Life
Sciences Dep Rep and Ian
French, Assistant Departmental
Supervisor, with the support of
F E L I X . Professor Wood had
been insisting that the service
could only re-open if it were self-
financing, but he has now
d r o p p e d this c o n d i t i o n .
However, the cost of tea and
coffee has been increased to lOp
so the department is expected to
make a profit on the running
costs of the tea room which will
go some way towards covering
the labour costs.
The future of the tea room is
still in doubt, however. The extra
a p p o i n t m e n t s are o n l y
temporary and last until 31 July,
when the provision of the tea
service will again be reviewed in
the light of next session's
departmental budget. Professor
Wood ends his term as head of
department this summer so the
new head, Prof R M Anderson,
will have to decide if the service
can continue into the next
session. Prof Anderson is known
to be sympathetic to the cause of
the tea room, having signed a
petition last term calling for it to
be reopened.

At last the tea room is back in operation with tea, coffee and biscuits
being served between 10:00-ll:00am each day.

The Adventure Continues
A new warden has been appointed at the Fremantle Hotel without the post
being advertised or interviews being held. The appointment of Nick
James, previously one of the Fremantle subwardens, to replace Andrew
Walker (who resigned last term) was approved by Union President
Gaynor Lewis on the recommendation of Student Services Officer
Michael Arthur.
M r James' post of subwarden
has been filled by Mark Green,
who was also appointed without
the post being advertised al-
though he had been interviewed
previously for a different post.
The other subwarden post,
originally occuped by Ruby Tan,
Andrew Walker's live-in girl-
friend, is to remain vacant. It
seems the post was only created
in the first place to prevent any
official embarrassement over the
fact that they weren't married.
Meanwhile, Nigel Simmons,
the F r e m a n t l e a s s i s t a n t
subwarden, has resigned his post.
This resignation appears to be
unconnected with recent events
at the Fremantle with M r
Simmons giving his reason for
resignation as the low standard of
his accommodation, which made
it difficult for him to do any
academic work. However, it
seems that his position will not be
filled for the time being, which
will mean that the number of
wardens in the Fremantle has
now dropped from four to two.
Miss Lewis claimed that the
normal procedure for the
appointment of wardens and
subwardens was not followed
because there was insufficient
time (the same excuse used when
Andrew Walker was appointed)
and there had been interviews
held for other posts earlier so
anyone interested in applying •
would presumably have applied
on a previous occasion and been
turned down. However, the fact
