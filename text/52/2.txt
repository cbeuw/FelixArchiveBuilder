T H E F R E S H E R ' S G U I D E :
3arJLiex t h i s year, ths p r o f i l e of John Harding
appeared as president of R.C.S. This time F i t . ;jrofiloa
him as number one man of the 1.3. Union. B-aitUs h i s union
a c t i v i t i e s , John i s also well-known as a leading member of
the Dramatic Society, amongst whom he i s more usually known
as " W i l l y " , after h i s celebrated performance.
W i l l y i s a d i f f i c u l t person to analyse, beyond the
first observation that an a r t i s t i c bent i s a greater element
in his character than i s p l a i n force. He keeps i n mind many
fluent ideas and accurate comments on events, but i s
reluctant t o thrust them forward, too quickly, i n public.
One i s therefore surprised at h i s success i n the Union. On
occasions, these two interests suit sach other's demands
well, but there ax® times when t h i s i s not so, such as h i s
speeches at recaptions, which are sometimes more serious
than suit the function.
Freshers w i l l have mat him at receptions, and some
Chemists w i l l have known 'aim as the^demonstrator who put out
t h e i r e a r l i e r experimental f i r e s ; but these appearances,
together with those at Union meetings, do not add up to shov.
the whole Harding. Commonsanse he may have gained from being
tossed around i n war-time evacuation, and experience from,
taking Matric. at a Co-ed school. Success i n obtaining a
Royal Scholarship came after two years i n a • school of boys
only, and he came 'to the R.C.S. Chemistry Department i n 1948
at the age of seventeen, a year e a r l i e r than he expected. He
thus missed h i s turn as Head Boy at school; here i s tha l i n k
that has l e d to h i s being '.Head Boy' of the 11.2. S. , and also
to h i s professed interest i o i n d u s t r i a l administration.
He admits that h i s abrupt change from school to I.C.
l e f t h i a with social commitments at home (Ilford)., that,
together with Finals i n h i s second year, l e f t him effective-
ly a Brown-Bagger at I.C. f o r so long. He eventually passed
from a mild interest i n the R i f l e Club v i a a second i n the
Seconds i n F i n a l s , to research and the Dramatic Society. He
has maintained h i s interest i n singing and s a i l i n g , and must
bo Zare i n having1
read a l l but ons of the books on show i n
hia considerable bookshelf.
This i s Johns fourth port-graduate year, doing
soaoarah on some extranely organic sulphur compounds, with
t h a i * unpleasant chemical - and s o c i al - problems. I t i s an
odd truth that f o r a l l h i s Union a c t i v i t i e s , John manages
to parcel his time so w e l l that he may most surely be
contacted i n the laboratory. This i s quite a reputation to
maintain.
During last year, John has had l i t t l e d i f f i c u l t y i n
presiding over the B.C.S. Union meetings. Some say that t h i s
is due to the general lack o f l i v e l i n e s s i n E.G. 3. I f so,
John w i l l have a new exp-erlence i n having, to control those .
who w i l l never be s a t i s f i e d with the Unions plans f o r the
Sifth o f November, when the next I.C. Union meeting takes-'
place.
This i s what John Harding, the President of I.C.U..
himself a postgrad, has to say to h i s colleagues!
Imperial College probably d i f f e r s i n many respects
from your previous university or college but I am sure that
for the f a c i l i t i e s i t offers i t i s second to none.' 'What-
ever sporting or s o c i a l interests you pursued during your
undergraduate days, you w i l l f i n d them a l l more than
adequately catered f o r at I.C. To those of you from
overseas the a c t i v i t i e s of the Union provide the most
convienient way of becoming acquainted vdth the
p e c u l i a r i t i e s of the English way of l i f e .
Nov/ that the majority of undergraduate freshers come
straight from school there i s a shortage of experienced
men to take responsible positions i n Union a f f a i r s . I t
i s t o the postgraduates to whom we must look f o r more
support than, i n general, they have given i n the past.
As a postgraduate myself I am sure that you can a l l f i n d
time f o r active participation i n at least one sphere of
Union a c t i v i t i e s .

WE'VE SEEK IT ALL BEFORE, BOYSJ
The log-truck races down the h i l l
T a l l p i n t s f l a s h by on e i t h e r side,
The d r i v e r ' s looking rather i l l
He's being taken f o r a r i d a ,
The brake i s gone - the angina roars
And a cinema audience snores.
Tht've seen i t a l l before, boys I
The've seen i t a l l before.
The frowning hero o f t h s scraan
Coolly wallops' the leading Judy,
She swipes him ons across ths bean -
Rather piqued, she's mean and moody,
The weary crowds are f i l i n g oat
They know too w e l l i t ' s love a t f i r s t c l o u t
The've seen i t a i l before, boys I
The'va seen i t a l l before.
Great Powers rumble w' i n f l a t i o n
And race t o arm - t h e people c a l l
" D e l i v e r us from l i b e r a t i o n , "
Powers, puppsts, ons and a l l
Inks partners f o r the dense macabre -
Or should I say the dance SSacArthur?
We won't see i t many times more', boyst
We wjn't see i t many times more.
