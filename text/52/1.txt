E N T E R THE FRESHER
This year sav/ the introduction of a new approach
to Freshers' Day. Instead of being just one day to which
a l l the Club o f f i c i a l s look forward as F-4ay, the crowd of
500 odd freshers was s p l i t up into three groups and i n v i t e d
to tea on the Saturday, Sunday and Monday preceding Black
Tuesday. This provided Club o f f i c i a l s with a better
opportunity to speak to the Freshers.
On each day, the Pro-Rector, the President, the
Chairman of the A.C.C. and the S.C.C., and representatives
of U.T.C. and the A i r Squadron made speeches from the
platform, a f t e r which Freshers went to tea and the Club
o f f i c i a l s . R e p e t i t i o n of speeches seemed to improve them
i n a way, though the platform party on Monday wore, one
thought, a look of being resigned to i t a l l - or was I
seeing things?
A welcome idea was to have one group composed
e n t i r e l y of Post-Graduates, as usually they don't take
k i n d l y to the l i n e handed out to UndergradT^reshers.
On Sunday, though, when the Post-Grads and the ladies
were i n , there seemed to be f a r too many people with tags
and f a r too few freshers to persuade.
The bar put up i n the Old Lounge that evening also
lacked demand. This i n fact appeared to be a fa.se of a
well-meant, well-planned idea m i s f i r i n g due to c/jsuses
beyond, so to speak, the Union's control.
Another innovation was the afternoon t a l k s given on
successive days by Profs. Levy, Blackett and Ford. They
spoke on topics of t h e i r own choice and, not giving
obvious sales-talks, were w e l l appreciated. Evensong
was held i n Hely T r i n i t y Church on Sunday, t h i s also
being f o r the f i r s t time i n the history of Freshers '".Days.
Altogether, an enterprising and successful attempt to
improve on the o l d system of craming a l l the Freshers
under one roof.

He has got so used to thinking about l i t u s of wine that

Seeing the state into which the Club had f a l l e n , i t

Every summer a f t e r exams, 1st year C i v i l s descend on
