Selby Angus has at l a s t r e t i r e d from the
PHOENIX Board; and I doubt whether anyone has even
done i t more g r a c e f u l l y . For, i n h i s l e t t e r of
r e s i g n a t i o n , which i s p r i n t e d i n the i s s u e under
review, Mr. Angus r e v e a l s to us a l l the s e c r e t s
and sorrows of a PHOENIX E d i t o r ' s mind. He w r i t e s
with a c l a r i t y , wit and Icnowledgeability which we
can only wonder at, and t r y to i m i t a t e . Mr. Angus,
a l i a s Jonathan Staggers, has been the p i l l a r of
PHOENIX f o r some, y e a r s , and h i s . l o s s w i l l be f e l t ,
f o r a year ago h i s "Staggers" etorle8.ii were more
widely read i n the c o l l e g e than tnose of h i s
predecessor ¥Jells.
Thus I found i t very d i s a p p o i n t i n g to read the
story "The C r e a t o r s " which Mr. Angus o f f e r s us as a
close to h i s career on the PHOENIX Board. But
" s t o r y " i s not the word. "The C r e a t o r s " i s a
dialogue between two higher beings, and i t i s con-
cerned with the c o n s t r u c t i o n of the u n i v e r s e i n
terms very reminiscent of the p h y s i c s l e c t u r e theaire.
We cannot f a i l to recognize the imagination and inr-
genuity which Mr. Angus has put i n t o the p i e c e ;
n e i t h e r can we f a i l to be s t i r r e d by some of h i s ex-
q u i s i t e l y formed phrases. I have never doubted
that Mr. Anguss c a p a b i l i t y of the sustained b r i l l i -
ance he shows i n "The Creators", but I would have
p r e f e r r e d Staggers.
The b e s t . o f the other f i c t i o n c o n t r i b u t i o n s ,
"A F o r t n i g h t i n L l a n e l p h a e s " i s g u i l t y of many o f
the f a u l t s i n s t y l e enumerated by Mr. Angus i n h i s
l e t t e r , but i s n e v e r t h e l e s s worth r e a d i n g . As
few works of f i c t i o n are not i n some way r e l a t e d
to the experiences of t h e i r authors, I should very
much l i k e to know what happened to Mr. Du Heaume
on h i s l a s t v i s i t to Wales.
One of the book reviews ( l i k e most of the work
i n t h i s e d i t i o n the product of Chem. Tech. and the
S c r i b l e r u s Club) i s very readable, and the book i n
question, "The Struggles of A l b e r t Woods", should
be very popular when, i n a few weeks time, i t
appears i n the Union L i b r a r y . Another review of
a t e c h n i c a l book, i s another example of the great
g e n e r o s i t y o f t e n shown by PHOENIX reviewers t o
w r i t e r s from the outer world. I f we are going to
write anything not Intended to be f i c t i o n then l e t
i t be the t r u t h , and, more important, the whole
t r u t h .
I was s u r p r i s e d to f i n d i n PHOENIX an a r t i c l e
e n t i t l e d "Communism and Humanitarian Causes".
While i t i s not badly w r i t t e n , t h i s a r t i c l e , which
c o n s i s t s c h i e f l y of quotations from Douglas ("I
believed") Hyde, i s not a gem of E n g l i s h PrOse.
In h i s E d i t o r i a l the new E d i t o r , Mr. Taylor, makes
i t c l e a r that he was hard put to i t to f i n d con-
t r i b u t i o n s f o r PHOENIX, but I am c e r t a i n , from my
own experiences with FELIX that he could have a l s o
found an a r t i c l e o f equivalent l i t e r a r y standard
w r i t t e n from the opposite ( i . e . s o c i a l i s t ) p o i n t
of view, to preserve n e u t r a l i t y . I h o l d no b r i e f
f o r L e f t i s m , but I f e e l that PHOENIX has d e a l t i t
an u n c o n s t i t u t i o n a l blow.
The r e s t of t h i s PHOENIX i s about average,
though the small s e c t i o n d e a l i n g with a c t i v i t i e s
contains a heartening and s t i m u l a t i n g account o f
the a s t o n i s h i n g successes of the Boat Club l a s t
session. The Review of A c t i v i t i e s s e c t i o n of
PHOENIX .las alv;ays been s u b j e c t to attack, but
who can deny Mr. Angus's remark that, as the yeare
pass, i t remains the only p a r t r e a l l y worth r e a d i n g 0
And having a r r i v e d back at Mr. Angus's remark-
able l e t t e r , which, f o r me, makes t h i s the beat
PHOENIX ever and which ought to be made i n t o m i l - .
