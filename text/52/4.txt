LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
9th October, 1953.
Dear S i r ,
I was amazed on coming i n t o the lower d i n i n g
h a l l the other morning to be t o l d that n o n - r e s i d e n t s
axe not permitted to have a cooked meal f o r b r e a k -
f a s t , but may partake of c e r e a l s and toast; t h e
r u l e having been i n f o r c e f o r a considerable number
of y e a r s .
Now the two apparent reasons are 1. R a t i o n
books, which the r e s i d e n t s have t o hand i n ; and
2. A f e e l i n g on the part of the r e s i d e n t s that they
should be allowed p r e f e r e n t i a l treatment t o the non-
r e s i d e n t s . With regard to the f i r s t v i r t u a l l y the
only r a t i o n e d food i s b u t t e r , and anyway the c a t e r -
i n g l i c e n c e of the d i n i n g h a l l goes e n t i r e l y on
meals served. The books are handed i n s o l e l y
because the members happen to be r e s i d e n t there.
In the second case the occupants of the h o s t e l
seem to f o r g e t what a tremendous p r i v i l e g e i t i s to
be one of the 85 out of 1600 who have managed to
get i n t o the h o s t e l . They go seeking f u r t h e r
p r i v i l e g e s , not only t o t h e i r own advantage, but to
the d e f i n i t e disadvantage of the p i t i a o l y few
members of I.C. s o c i a l l y minded enough t o have
meals i n the Union.
The thought that p o s s i b l y a student may t r a v e l
up to London and n e e d a b r e a k f a s t i n town, n a t u r a l l y
at the most convenient place, o r even l i v e i n a room
near the c o l l e g e and e a t i n the r e f e c t o r y seems to
be completely l o s t . To be domesticated i n the
centre of c o l l e g e a c t i v i t i e s at a cost very many
times l e s s than that a v a i l a b l e anywhere e l s e i n
London, and s t i l l ask f o r more i s p o o r form. I
t h e r e f o r e c a l l on t h e U n i o n t o t h r o w o u t , as they
oan, t h i s and i n d e e d a l l such, p e t t y r e s t r i c t i o n s
which serve no p r a c t i c a l purpose.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
M i c h a e l F. Baty, .

Dear S i r ,
I am w r i t i n g to you on two matters concern
the I.C. Hag Committee. The f i r s t i s the matter
of an I.C. war-cry. Last year FELIX a t our
request p u b l i s h e d an appeal f o r ideas on a war-
ory, and one e f f o r t appeared i n a l a t e r i s s u e .
I f any more are a v a i l a b l e , I would l i k e to have
them
I would l i k e you to b r i n g our existence to
the n o t i c e of Freshmen. We i n v i t e any of them
who have any b r i g h t ideas i n the way of rags to
contact me, through the Union rack, as we are
always g l a d of f r e s h i n s p i r a t i o n . We p r e f e r to
remain u n o f f i c i a l , so that the Union need not be
o f f i c i a l l y connected with our a c t i v i t e s .
Yours e t c . ,
D i e Schone M u l l e n i n .
Chairman, Rag C o m m i t t e e .
Letters are i n v i t e d on a l l subjects howsoever

At the crack of dawn on the Sth August a bur; s topped
at the top entrance. iuid&y members of the I.C. Dram* 3oc
started putting a l l the npps, f l a t s , f o o l bones, l i g h t s

and handed, us the firearm license f o r the gun and r i f l e

Our destination was the C i v i c Playhouse, Old llciiham,
v/here vre were to (and did) give 7 perfornances of
Captain Carvalls by Duncan. Both Saturday's and Sunday's
performances "./ere very w e l l attended. During the week,
apparently, the Cheltenham, populace v/ai
t h e i r wealth than t h e i r culture.
Jhe acting was up to the usual standard;
however, was very w e l l done. Becaus
of the stage ( i t was formerly part of the baths) a whole
roof had to be constructed. ' .liile the actors v/ere

Reflections on a Dinner Jacket.
At t h i s time of the year most fr-shers resolve to go
he 1054 Comueni. "'all, offering as an excuse the lack of
evening dress and suitable partner, or even the lack of
dancing a b i l i t y . Also, at t h i s time of the year, a number
of second and t h i r d year men make the same resolution, f o r
the same reasons. Some of them wake up before they leave

- discover what they have been missing. Of the
others, presumably many w i l l never know how t h e i r youth has
been mis-spent. A good s t a r t to a U n i v e r s i t y career has
not been made unless s o c i a l , a t h l e t i c and i n t e l l e c t u a l ac-
t i v i t i e s have been properly balanced.
For some years I Iiave been begging. and borrowing
dinner jackets, but a recent incident convinced me of the
necessity of having lay own. Being i n v i t e d to a b a l l , I
made my usual strenuous e f f o r t s to borrow clothing, and
borrowed father's though i t was i n a condition such as to
inspire the sub-heading of t h i s column. Arriving at the b a l l
I discovered to . y hoivor tiist everybody else wore fancy
dress. I.y embarassnent readied a ma::inun when I was awar-
ded the prize f o r a 'nagnificent imitation of Charlie Chaplin.
The f i r s t hop of the session was notable f o r the
number of new records" used. I t lias been our habit to
complain over the unenterprising nature of the records
usually played, but t h i s time v/e can say nothing. One
or two of the new records were a t r i f l e d i f f i c u l t to
donee to, especially some slow quicksteps, but no doubt
a few"trials w i l l weed them out. I wonder whether any
of the early Dixie Land, J e l l y H o l l and Pats nailer discs
are worth exploring? This i s a matter f o r connoisseurs.
Perhaps some collectors would be prepared to lend t h e i r
records to the Entertainments Committee f o r an evening.
This column w i l l pass on any Suggestions received.
The hop was s l i g h t l y marred by en excitable youth ;,
who threw some fireworks on to the f l o o r , and caused
some clothes to be damaged. This kind of behaviour has
occured at Karlington and people have been injured.
Following the success of l a s t year's General Studies
Lectures, lip, KcDowall lias produced a magnificent
programme f o r this term. FELIX conducted a survey
almost a year ago, and discovered that, though the
Lectures were very popular there was a wide demand f o r
more current events and more controversy. llr. IIcDawall
has gone a long way towards satisfying these dm-wands.
Trade Unions, Central African Federation, Cooperatives
and Commercial Television are among the topics to be
included this term. Dr. Jacques, conductor of .the
Bach Choir, w i l l continue h i s amazingly successful talks
on music.

Among our o r i g i n a l c r i t i c i s m s of the lectures v/e
noted that some theatres p a r t i c u l a r l y the la-ge physics
theatre, often needed microphones. I remember trying
to l i s t e n to a talk on Anerica by sn eminent authority,
and finding i t quite impossible to t e l l ".'hat was being
said. Thus odd, overlooked technical points can
completely ruin the lectures.
It i s also very i m o r t a n t that lectures f i n i s h
punctually at 2.SO n.n.
The rate of flow of the lunchtime queue i n "-he n^w

Thus, when pecple walk s t r a i ht to the head of the .queue
