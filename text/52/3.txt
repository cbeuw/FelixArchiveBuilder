I t i s usual, at t h i s time o f the. year, tffiMr V P
f i r s t Hop of the tern, f o r FELIX t o ccasaent on use —Win•»
of the Hop and on the behaviour of those present. 1 M « year
JEL1X went amongst the young 3.adies present to see what'
they thought of the Hop.
I t was remarkable that we ever met our f i r s t v i c t i m ,
as she complained that a f t e r a r r i v i n g outside the antrame
to the Union i n Prince Consort. Head, they could n't f i n d
th® way round the tennis courts. This young lady d i d n* t-.
say at what time she arrived; i f i t was any time aftex 10.00
we could w e l l imagine the d i f f i c u l t i e s confronting anyone
attempting to got to the gym. However, once inside the gym,
t h i s v i s i t o r from Weatfield thought -the arrangements quite
good but d i d riot enjoy seeing a great mob of I.C. standing
across the edge of the f l o o r . She added that she had no
objection, to them standing there, once she had been asked
for a dance.
A member of Q.E.C. was the neat to be interviewed. HOT
main objection was to fellows spending the eyening i n the
bar u n t i l paao-outs were no longer required to get into the
Hop. When i t was pointed out to her that quite a few of
these fellows would have come i n e a r l i e r i f they had been
able to buy t i c k e t s , she replied that ahe had got i n with-
out a t i c k e t and had stayed at Q.E.S. u n t i l she thought she
would be able to get i n . I t was n't not being able to get a
t i c k e t that kept her away - she did n't think the manners
of the nrn wore good enough to spend a s h i l l i n g on a t i c k e t
The use of vooal records was c r i t i c i s e d by one of the
young ladies from The C entral School of Speech and Drama,
which was t o be expected. She said that a vocalist, should
be t r y i n g to put feeling into the words, and i f t h i s was
done, the rhythm would be affected. FELIX was n't awajr* of
muoh f o e l i n g , i n any of ths records, but the rhythm s t i l l
l e f t much t o be desired. One of the -worst features of the
Hop, was the nerve-racking process of having to traverae
the length o f the lounge i n order t o get to the ladi.es
cloakroom, while a l l the male inhabitants o f the lounge
eyed them up and down. She did n't appreciate that most o f
us l i k e to know what w i l l be available during the evening.
OUT severest c r i t i c was from Bedford Callage. She
aoeused the crowd,at the back of the gjm, o f moral oowajs**
ice i n not asking the g i r l s f o r a dance. I t i s a debatable
point that t h i s ' moral cowardice' might be j u s t i f i e d . Then
she went on t o c r i t i c i z e the very poor staadard of dmaijass.
I t isas admitted, although vary r e l u c t a n t l y , that their© www
amis quite good dancers amongst as, but ate *rga.ed th»t -
