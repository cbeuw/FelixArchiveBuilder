As usual Imperial College G l i d i n g Club has
been p a r t i c u l a r l y a c t i v e t h i s summer. The
v a c a t i o n commenced w i t h a f o r t n i g h t ' s t r a i n i n g
course f o r new members on the l i n e s of the E a s t e r
co'irse. Under more p r o p i t i o u s weather c o n d i t i o n s
than p r e v a i l e d at E a s t e r , t h i s r a i s e d a l l newcomers
to an advanced stage and two of them went s o l o .
The major event of tne year was n a t u r a l l y the
B r i t i s h ,National G l i d i n g Championships h e l d at
Great Huciclow i n "Derbyshire. For t h i s the c o l l e g e
entered a Sedvergh two-seater and an Olympia s a i l -
plane. In "Daisy", the two-seater, the firms of
Macfie and Thomas, and Macfie and Langston did two
epic cross country f l i g h t s of seventy-five miles
apiece, while tne f i r m of Kurden and Ne«le -nana^ed
ttj get somewhat over half-way round an a l t o g e t h e r
impossible 100-kilometre t r i a n g u l a r c i r c u i t . As
a r e s u l t of these f e a t s "Daisy" was placed f o u r t h
i n the two-seater c l a s s . "Creamo", the club
Olympia, was f o r c e d to r e t i r e on the l a s t day of
the competitions due to an attempt to land through
some wires, but n e v e r t h e l e s s earned t h i r t e e n t h
place i n the s i n g l e - s e a t e r c l a s s . Plans are now
afoot t o use the insurance money from the fragments
o f "Creamo" to purchase a high-performance two-
seater s a i l p l a n e from Germany. I n a d d i t i o n to
making two-seater f l y i n g more l u x u r i o u s , i t could
be employed f o r advanced i n s t r u c t i o n i n t o the
mysteries of soaring.
A more down-to-earth improvement i n the club
f a c i l i t i e s i s the new Vanguard which w i l l s h o r t l y
replace Mephista as the standard means of transport
between Imperial College and Lasham. The new
v e h i c l e , covered i n plush, w i l l be f a s t e r , more
comfortable and f a r cheaper to run.

On June 30th a party of happy cricketers l e f t i n a
coach f o r the annual invasion of Devon. Eight days
l a t e r they returned, somewhat surprisingly, i n the sane
coach, after winning four matches, having the best of a
draw with Torquay and losing three.
A l l the I.C. players enjoyed some measure of success.
iVyles scored 76 not out i n an hour against Brixham, Where
I.C. won an exciting race against time. I.C. began
rather slowly against Torquay, with some s o l i d Lancastrian
caution from Kitchen (59). However, Kitchener (52 not
out) and K. 7/eale h i t out f r e e l y and I.C. declared at
.161 f o r 8. Torquay started badly and never appeared
l i k e l y to score the runs, and had scored 101-8 at the
close.
The closest f i n i s h was against the Royal llaval
Barracks. I.C. batted f i r s t but collapsed. A fine
r a l l y by Thuraan (39) and Severn (16) took the score to
14-3, but the Barracks just won, by one wicket.
I.C. usually f a i l dismally against t h e i r t r a d i t i o n a l
country opponents at i.Tiimple, but t h i s year, under the
inspiring captaincy of K. 7/eale, scored a great victory
by 137 (v/illmer 37, Kitchener 28, Viyles 25) to 82
(Eammerton 8 f o r 20). No-one succeeded i n h i t t i n g the
famous tree .vfliieh flourishes half-way to the boundary.
Eamraerton took 27 wickets on the tour, two more
than our previously acknowledged champion, the inimitable
R.J. Reynolds, who emits strange snorting noises as he
careers up to the wicket.
'The I.C. players doubtless owed much of their success
to their a b i l i t y to relax completely i n the evenings -
t h i s they d i d with outstanding success. Lany tales have
been t o l d and w i l l be t o l d i n the Bar before July comes
round again and printing them here would rob them 91" t h e i r
flavour.

Kexfc year's tour i s over the period June 30th -
