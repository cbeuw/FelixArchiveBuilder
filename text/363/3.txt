I'm sure you have all been welcomed to or welcomed back
to the College many times already so I won't bore you by doing
so again.
There are several points that some of you will be interested
in that I will try to put into sections below.
PARKING PERMITS
If you wish to park your car
in college during the coming
session, you will have to fill
in a form which is available
from the Union Office. I feel I
must warn you however, that
there are only 193 permits and
I expect in excess of 600
applications, so it would be
far wiser to leave your car at
home unless it is absolutely
impossible to do so. Please do
not bring your car into college
until you have a permit because
you will not be allowed ttf
part without one.
If you have a motorcycle
you do not need a permit, but
you must park only in the areas
that are specifically for motor-
cycles.
Please be sensible about
parking your vehicle, remember
to think of other people!
ELECTIONS
Several of the posts were
not filled last year, and several
others have become vacant due
to exam failures. Nomination
papers for these posts and for
posts normally elected in the
first term will be posted on
the Council noticeboard in the
Union Lower Lounge at the
beginning of term.
If you have any questions
to ask about what the jobs are
and what they involve, please
come into the Union Office and
ask me, or anyone else who
is around.
MEETINGS
The first IC Union General
Meeting this year is on October
8th at 1p.m. in the Great Hall,
College Block. Decisions made
will affect you. Don't worry
that you may have a lecture at
1.30p.m., because on Tuesdays
and Thursdays each week
lectures do not start til I 2.30p.m.
Please come along and take
part, decisions will be made
that affect you. Also John Carr
Vice President without Portfolio
of NUS and President of U L U ,
should be coming along to
speak to the meeting.
These are just a few of
the points I have thought of,
over the last couple of days .
If you have any further problems
please come and ask someone.
R C C V A N S
We would like to remind prospective drivers
of the vehicles that on Wednesday October 9th,
they must be fully registered:
1. Have satisfactorily completed a driving test
in one of the vehicles.
2. Have paid a £5 security deposit.
Those people who do not satisfy all these
conditions will be removed from the drivers
list.
I will be available to receive security
deposits any lunch time during the week.

NEW PARTICLES STUDIED
Name withheld at Author's request
IN THE issue before last of ' F E L I X ' ,
there was a report on the research work
of Prof. A. Rahim concerning the newly
discovered animal species ' P G ' .
In the same spirit, namely the popular-
isation of contempory science, we give
here the report by Dr. V.D. Vcoi, on his
interview with Prof. Sir R.Z. Ryle who
once upon a time (i.e. at 1/t) received
the Nobel Prize in Peace. Because of
the nature of the research work, some
secrecy has to be retained, and certain
names have been 'translated'. (The more
intelligent readers, however, no doubt
can work out the real names).
Prof. Ryle is interested not in animals
but in particles. A lot of particles tiave
been known for a long time, examples
being electrons, protons, and neutrons .
In the now classic paper published in
Proc. ICU, Prof. Ryle announced the
discovery of yet another two new types
of particles with entirely novel char-
acteristics. He named them 'maons' and
'feons' respectively.
It is well known that electrons, for
instance, can form stable pairs, in each
of which the electrons have opposite
spins. Pairing may also occur when
maons and feons collide, but a pair will
consist of a maon and a feon, and not
(usually) of particles of the same kind.
Certain 'strong interactions' are res-
ponsible for the affinity between maons
and feons. However, until now even Prof.
Ryle has not been able to write down the
exact equations for !';<? interaction laws,
and it cannot be explained why a given
feon will pair with certain maons but not
the other maons, and vice versa, which is
what has been observed.
A pair of maon and feon is unstable.
After a while they will either become
disassociated again or if not get into an
excited state together. In the latter case,"
the excitation energy can increase until
the particles mutually penetrate the
other's potential energy barrier, generating
a high-rank tensor field and a resulting
high-energy kinetic resonance:
(G/ ( E - E o - i G / 2 ) ) -» oo .
Approximately 3.62 + 0.03 GeV are
dissipated by the resonance process
(which is irreversible and generates
thermodynamic entropy), and the particles
get de-excited exponentially, with the
maon usually having a shorter time-
constant.
Prof. Ryle told Dr. Vcoi that he and
his research students are working on the
further elucidation of the properties of
maons and feons. In particular, he is very
interested in the strong interactions
mentioned above, a better understanding
of which he believes, will greatly ad-
vance the frontier of human knowledge
(and experience).
