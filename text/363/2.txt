IT WAS with some amusement that
a meeting of the Imperial College Union
Executive had pretentiously decided
(not recommended, or advised) that the
Editor of F E L I X , having been elected
as Editor cum Publicity Officer, shall
in fact be Publicity Officer. It had
apparently gotten into their heads that
the Editor might refuse to adopt his
publicity duties or some such tripe.
Their decision is as bad as Council
deciding that the President shall be
the head of the Union or that the Deputy
President shall be responsible for the
Union building. I.e. the Executive
wasted approximately two hours coming
to an irrelevant decision. Nevertheless,
their conscientious motivation for
discussing such an issue can hardly be
ridiculed in the light of the experience
the Union has had with some of the
more recent Editors. Rather, it is to be
applauded in as much they have the
interests of the Union at heart.
It is with immense regret that the
Editor must announce the departure
from the F E L I X staff of Clive Dewey.
He has worked hard on the last two
issues and was responsible for producing
many of the photographs therein. He
also made some creditable contributions
to the Reviews Section.
However, his association with
F E L I X reached flashpoint when it was
determined that his outside interests
and opportunist attitude were inapp-
ropriate for the job that was expected
of him.
F E L I X would like to take this
opportunity to wish him every success
in establishing the Campus Radio.
Apologies are in order to all those
people who were offended by the front
page of the Freshers' Issue of F E L I X
It is understood that a lot of people
took offence to what they saw. It had
been promised by F E L I X not to print
such a thing, but at the last moment,
the Editor felt that he had no choice.
The Editor undertakes not to print such
a silly space-filler as 'FELIX
WELCOMES FRESHERS' on the front
page again.

O
THEFTS
All Colleges are vul-
nerable in varying degrees
to this problem and the
open plan nature of Imperial
College presents difficulties
of this kind. Cycles, in-
cluding motor cycles, should
be secured with a strong
chain and a stout padlock.
Plastic covered cables, as
supplied by cycle dealers
are quite inadequate for this
purpose. If you value your
cycle, you are advised to
insure it and don't forget to
make a note of the serial
number on the frame.
Money and other val-
uables should be carried on
the person and not left in
jackets hanging on chairs
etc. in unattended rooms and
laboratories.
LOST AND FOUND
PROPERTY
All losses of personal
property on the campus
should be promptly reported
to the Security Office.
Persons finding property on
the campus are asked to
hand it in either to the
Security Office or to one of
the messengers or security
guards. Unidentifiable fold-
ers containing lecture notes
are frequently handed in to
the Security Office so
would help the loser to
recover his property if his
name and the name of his
Department were written on
such documents. Many items
of found property are never
claimed by the losers which
suggests that students are
unaware of the facilities
provided.
MOTOR VEHICLES
Please don't bring your
motor car into the College
Car Park unless you have
been allocated a parking
space and don't leave It on
the campus until it becomes
derelict. If you wish to
leave your solo motor cycle
on the College premises
please put it in one of the
authorised places and re-
gister it by giving the app-
ropriate details to the
Security Officer.
A.D. Dawson,
Security Officer.
