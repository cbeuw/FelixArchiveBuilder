4 M U X
SOUTH OF ENGLAND
TOUR DRAMA
ANYONE PASSING ICU on the morning of Monday 30th June,
might have been forgiven for wondering why twenty three bodies
with assorted motorcars, transit vans and a locomotive-like J4
were scattered about Prince Consort Road. This was the annual
summer trek of IC Dramatic Society (hereinafter known as Dramsoc)
to an unsuspecting audience
of children, dogs and OAPS in
Hampshire and Dorset.
The play, As You Like It,
by our national playwrite,
was presented in a glorious
collection of Edwardian cos-
tumes and a bicycle. However,
more interest was shown in the
extracumcular activities, viz
shopping inWoolies (Farnham),
clipping Camden, eating cheese
and pickle sandwiches (!),
walking to the needles (l-O-W),
visiting Beaulieu and taming
New Forest ponies.
The stages varied in size
from twelve feet (with lantern
throw of six inches) at Lyming-
ton to forty feet at Bryanston
(not where the pickle comes
from). Luckily several tall
members of the cast were able
to take the place of A-frames
at some schools so that the
hanging of lanterns was but
the work of a moment. The
audiences varied from seven
hundred to twentyfour (not at
the same performance) but
expressed great pleasure at
such a polished performance.
One of the highlights of the
tour was the annual cavort in
Lymington high street; this
involved the entire cast — in
full costume rushing around
Tescos drumming up an aud-
ience and ended in the
traditional darts and drink in
the Anchor and Hope P.H.
All accommodation was in
tents and vans at various
campsites, fellow campers
were suprised to hear references
to the Taj Mahal, the Hilton,
the Inn-on-the-Park, and the
Dorchester (as our tents,
kindly loaned by ICYHA group,
were known).
If you want to find out what
fun we masochists can get out
of slaving away for a fortnight
in the hot sun and under 5,000w
arc lights, come and join
DRAMSOC - at anytime on the
2Vi floor in the north east
comer of the Union buildjng
(go up the stairs past the Union
Office and you can't miss it).
(P.S. Has anyone seen a box
of apples?).
