Mid-Week Special
NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION F R E E I
No. 363 THURSDAY 3rd OCTOBER 1974
FRESHERS'
FAIR LAST TUESDAY saw
the spectacle of about
2,000 Freshers furiously
meandering about in the
Union Building clutching,
clutching fistfuls of
bumph.
The Constituent College
Unions were there in full
force. Mascots and all.
Tents, dinghies, boats,
cups, a glider and other
sundry items (such as
gorgeous dolly-birds)
abounded in the quad-
rangle.
In the evening was the
Freshers' Concert in the
Great Hall featuring Heavy
Metal Kids ana Good
Habit. It is understood,
however, that this concert
made an unfortunate loss
of about Â£300..
To cap it all off,
Phillips, the ICU Pres-
ident, was left holding
the baby (the Rector's
grandson, in fact).
