The felix guide to...
The pop and the
politics
– the title may evoke a picture
of eight kids with superpow-
ers teaming up to destroy a
common threat – which is
something I wish I could say
had never crossed my mind
prior to watching – damn
those superhero movies! If it
does, promptly pull it out of
your brain and head to the
nearest bin for disposal.)
Set in 1979, in the rural
town of Lillian, Ohio, Super
8 centers around a group of
14-year-old kids who share a
love for filmmaking. Joe (Joel
Courtney), having recently
lost his mother in a local mill
accident, copes by escaping
into his hobbies: painting plas-
tic train models and making
zombie films. His friend,
Charles (Riley Griffiths), the
amateur director of the apoc-
alyptical film they’re making,
is opportunistic and has an
eye for things that have “pro-
duction value!”, which brings
the group along to a deserted
a storekeeper asks Charles
at one point). It feels like J.
J. Abrams is paying tribute
to a lot more than just old
Spielberg movies, but rather
sentimentally to the 1970’s as
a whole.
Emotionally driven at its
heart, Super 8 – like Spiel-
berg’s E.T. and A.I. Artificial
Intelligence – manages to
convince viewers to exert
sympathy on the characters
and to care about what hap-
pens to them. Joe and Alice’s
parental loss and familial
conflicts are narrated in such
a way that you wish you were
there to tell them everything’s
going to be alright – although
the lack of a rule dictating
someone’s life will get better
in the long run means this
is poor consolation. Boiled
down to its melancholic
essence, Super 8 whispers a
faint message about letting
go of a loved one and
feelings of resentment – a
whisper loud enough for you
to hear and take home the
message.

More than just an homage to
early Spielberg films, J.J. Abram’s
2011 sci-fi adventure film Super 8
explores the relationships between
families, and the tricky navigation
teenagers must face as they

storyline, Super 8
is much more than

train station one night to
shoot a scene. Trouble looms
as they find themselves in
the middle of a massive train
derailment, marking the start
of the emerging terror that
besets the town: people in
Lillian go missing, along with
their dogs and electrical
appliances, compelling an
electronics saleswoman to
proclaim, “this feels like a Rus-
sian invasion!” – an allusion
to the rising tension with the
Soviet Union as the Cold War
was entering new heights.
The kids form a search-
and-rescue mission in secret
as they attempt to locate a
missing group member. The
shroud of mystery surround-
ing the town’s growing threat
is lifted when the kids stumble
upon their school teacher’s
belongings in his ‘dungeon’.
A series of events following
their discovery, alternat-
ing between disaster and
serendipity, culminates in its
conclusion – a spectacular
show of affection between the
kids and their parents, whose
accompanying orchestral
music by Michael Giacchino
(who won an Oscar for his
score in Up) manages to
impose a quiet weeping
session on this particular
reviewer.
Through the course of their
adventure, the nature of Joe
and Charles’ relationship
changes as Joe, in the style of
Todd Anderson in Dead Poets
Society, breaks his cocoon of
shyness and subservience and
morphs into a more assertive
and gritty persona. The mov-
ie’s intimate and human facet
slowly unfolds as Joe and
Alice (Elle Fanning), a school
friend playing the detective’s
wife in the zombie thriller
they’re filming, discover they
have more in common than
just tender feelings for each
other – they both suffer from
lack of love and emotional
understanding from their
single fathers. Joe, like Alice,
endures constant arguments
with his dad, a deputy sheriff
who copes with the loss of
his wife by throwing himself
into his job. In one particu-
larly heartbreaking scene
Joe and his dad have an
emotional row at home, and
his dad’s seemingly apathetic
J.J. Abram’s love letter to the films of his child-
hood centres around a group of early-teens

Super 8
J
. J. Abrams’ sci-fi
adventure Super 8
is a poetic tribute
to early Spielberg
films, taking us
down the avenue
of their childhood memories:
shooting action films with
neighbourhood friends on an
8mm format camera – known
as the Super 8, it was first
marketed in the 60’s as a
user-friendly sound-recording
camera. The film’s beautiful
visuals are hard to ignore and
coupled with an emotionally-
stirring storyline, Super 8
succeeds in becoming more
than a mere homage to
Spielberg.

demeanour reaffirms the
notion that he’s unfit for the
role of a father. Scratch the
veneer of the town’s mys-
terious goings-on, and the
worried lives of a few Lillian
residents becomes percep-
tible, with many touching
scenes setting the tone for a
film that deals with themes of
forgiveness and letting go.
Super 8 is filled with cultural
remnants from the 1970’s,
like the Walkman cassette
player and Blondie’s ‘Heart
of Glass’, just in case the
viewer wasn’t watching the
film keenly enough to notice
the characters dressed in
unmistakably 70’s-fashioned
clothes and driving 70’s-pe-
riod cars, not to mention the
liberal culture around recrea-
