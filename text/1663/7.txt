Imperial
College's white
vision for White
City
Alex Chaudhri and Kieran Ryan think
it's time the exclusive drinking societies
were held to the same standard as
everyone else
A
t the end of
last term I
attended a
Union Council
m e e t i n g .
Before the
meetingcouldcommencethere
was an extensive powerpoint
presentation about the
college’s development in
White City, Imperial West,
given by Professor Neil
Alford (Imperial White City
Syndicate).
As someone who has lived in
Shepherd’s Bush this last year,
I am aware of the rampant
gentrification affecting the
area, and I am disgusted by
Imperial’s involvement in this.
The rent increases in W12
have already been forcing
people from their homes and
increased rates are quickly
transforming Shepherd’s
Bush’s diverse high street into
yet another lifeless row of
chain stores.
After showings us slides with
a vision of White City campus’s
streets lined with chain food
shops – Costa, Pret a Manger,
etc. – Professor Neil Alford
made a ‘joke’, saying that he
didn’t know exactly which
stores would open up, but
knowing the area perhaps
there would be a Chicken
Cottage. Chuffed with himself,
he received rapturous giggles
from many of the assembled
at the council meeting for
a comment that was racist,
deeply classist, and exposed
the condescending entitlement
that festers at all levels of this
university.
I was appalled that he could
so casually say something
so vile. He effortlessly
glorified his privilege over
the W12 community and was
received with affirmation and
congratulation by the Union
Council and members of the
student body. Personally, I
expect that Chicken Cottage
would neither be able to
afford the rent or that there
would be a community for it to
serve, let alone be allowed to
serve.
Already,thegoliathWestfield

across the east of W12, and
is currently expanding. The
\\ Imperial have seen an

people’s lives \\
shopping centre’s architecture
is designed to alienate the
individual, its clinical structure
intended to make rich people
feel comfortable and to keep
consumerism slick. Behind
Westfield is the former BBC
Television Centre and Imperial
West. The W12 night sky is
polka dotted with the red
lights of construction cranes.
It’s a picture we see across
London (and the country’s
high streets). A community,
with little political or financial
influence, who work hard to
make part of the city unique
and interesting is recognised
for these facts and that area of
London is labelled as ‘exciting’.
This is, of course, a term used
to fetishise and brand an area
into a commercial product.
Then the developers come
in. ‘Exciting’ is an asset to
increase financial value, an
estate agent’s wet-dream.
Already rent is soaring –
mine has gone up 20% on
the previous year. Homes
are being demolished
and replaced by the same
uniformity designed to make
rich people feel at home.
They are designed such that
the incoming elite can feel
unthreatened by the reality
of diverse people having to
coexist in a city. The ethnically
diverse largely working
class community is becoming
displaced, marginalised and
destroyed, and replaced
with rich, white, photo-op
favourable professionals. All
money made from this venture
will be extracted to line the
pockets of the economic elite.
One of the first stages of
construction, already well
underway, is the 35-storey
luxury residential tower that
is designed to rise high above
the neighbourhood and assert
Imperial’s dominance. The
purpose of the tower is to make
money and to show off. It will
have 192 flats of which only
12% are “affordable” three-
bedroom homes. The law for
residential developments is
that 36% of homes must fit
this category. Imperial is not
having to play by the rules.
Further to this, these 12% of
homes will be solely rented
to “key-workers” – people
whom the college has chosen
to live there. They will not be
available to the public.
Moreover, Imperial’s
definition of “affordable” was
a target household income
\\ Homes are being
demolished and
replaced by the

designed to make
rich people feel at
home \\
of up to £77,200. In 2012,
when the planning application
was accepted by Boris
Johnson’s Mayor’s Office,
£37,900 post-tax income
was the 88th
percentile in the
UK. Clearly the College’s
definition of “affordable” was
either fraudulent or totally
out of touch. In fact, the
Mayor’s office deemed this
“overpriced” but still gave the
go ahead.
Alford then congratulated
the College for entering
into a group of developers
gentrifying the area. He hoped
that they would be able to do
something like the King’s Cross
development. The King’s Cross
area is a huge redevelopment
area controlled and operated
by the King’s Cross Central
Partnership Limited. The
area is policed by a militia
of private security. Potential
residents undergo selection
before they can even view
the mostly multi-million
pound properties to rent. Like
Imperial, King’s Cross failed to
provide the legally required
affordable and social
housing. In fact, they went
further, cancelling some of the
construction to build a further
100 luxury homes. In 2012,
Corporate Watch dubbed the
development“acrudeexercise
in social engineering”. Their
investigation found that
people with a history of mental
health were being deliberately
excluded from social housing
and quotas were set for the
number of homeless people
in the area. The discrimination
and exclusivity underpinning
these projects oppresses
people struggling to survive
in our city and creates socially
dead spaces. Imperial sets its
aspirations high.
Let’s be clear, White City
Campus is a thinly veiled
money making scheme,
the veneer of ‘science’ and
‘education’ are all that is
needed to shuffle through
their plans. The vast majority
of the site will be rented out
to private businesses, chain
shops and luxury housing.
Regarding the start of
construction on the residential
tower, Imperial Development
Director Graham Stark said
that “[the development]
demonstrates our long-term
commitment to delivering
a vibrant mixed use
community.” This is a further
insight into Imperial’s selfish
ignorance of the currently
existing community and
desire of the developers to
cleanse the area of all but
the high rent economic elite.
Imperial College looks after
its own. They have seen an
opportunity to make a lot of
money and taken it with zero
consideration for people’s
lives. As strong as this may
sound, I am ashamed to be
affiliated with the college.
