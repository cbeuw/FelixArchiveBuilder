Divestthis
I
s Imperial morally bankrupt? I first asked myself
this question in 2011 when I started my Biology
undergraduate. My department had just sacked
most, if not all of its plant scientists. There was no
money in the field. Have I come close to an answer
since? Maybe. Sometimes I’ve looked at Imperial
and higher education in the UK in general and I’ve
felt disgusted by it. The way research is determined by
corporate giants, whether that’s Big Oil or Pharma, or
whether it’s weapons, or it’s banks. The way academics
are pressured to publish, to bring in the money, to
ignore things that in any other workplace would be
uncompromisable. The way students are seen as cash
cows, cheap labour, endless in supply, desperate.
Other times I look around me and I can’t help but
be in awe. Of the people I’m surrounded by; some
of my generation’s brightest minds. Of the ideas that
are constantly being exchanged, lighting up the eyes
of students and staff. Of the tenacity with which some
people can hunt for ideals, knowledge, dreams.
The struggle to divest lies at the border between the
dark and the light sides of science. We know fossil fuel
use is unsustainable. Every step of the production line
in the fossil fuel industry ravages the environment and
detriments our health. Yet our civilization relies on it
still.
I understand the energy crisis humanity is facing at
the moment is a challenging one. But unfortunately it’s
one we have to overcome, there is no alternative. We
change or we go down with the ship.
And here is where it gets complicated. As much as
I might badmouth it (and I do a lot), I don’t believe
Imperial to be morally bankrupt. But I do think that as
a science institution we get trapped in the numbers and
facts and logistics and practicalities and complexities
of the situation. And maybe it’s time to take a step
back from the science and think about the ethics of our
actions, our investments.
It’s time to make a decision based on our heart and
invest in our dreams instead.

emember last
week’s postgrad
graduation day? It
made the Union of
ton of dough. The
largest graduation
ceremony to date which saw
a record of 9,400 guests
attend, brought Union shops
and outlets a total of £34,715.
That’s about 13 grand more
than last year and eight grand
more than the record year of
2015.
Postgrad Graduation Day
saw over 3,284 graduates
receiving their diplomas. That
means that proud families
spent a tenner on average on
their graduates. That’s on top
of the £51-58 that gown hire
costs and a hat purchase (you
can’t hire them) which will set
you back another £30. Proud
parents are another extra that
will cost you £35 a pop. If
Union reels in £34,000 from
Postgrad Graduation Day
you think it’s worth it, to watch
Boyce Avenue at the Royal
Albert Hall in November, book-
ing a ticket now wouldn’t cost
you less than £30. And these
are just the essentials.
We’re not even going to talk
about pictures, wax figurines
and engraved rings.
From ticket sales to the grad-
uates’ family and friends,
College is estimated to have
made about £328,000.
When asked about profits
a College spokesperson said
that Imperial “endeavours to
keep the cost of Graduation
day as low as possible and
we do not charge students
for their attendance [Aw how
sweet]. The income received
from guest tickets only covers
part of the cost to the College
– no surplus funds whatsoever
are received from Graduation.
I guess thanks are in order.
Dear Lef,
I enjoyed Tessa’s article on millennials
and entitlement in the May 5 edition. As
a lecturer who was an undergraduate
at Imperial in the early 90s I’ve seen the
issue from both sides I guess. Teaching
always seemed low on the priority list in
my days in EE yet when the teaching was
good it was brilliant. Eric Yeatman, Chris
Toumazou and others I’m looking at you.
But what about the wider question of
whether today’s young people are enti-
tled or obliged? Back in my day, the gov
paid for my first degree and there was
even some drinking money left over in my
grant cheque. Contrast that with today’s
tuition fees, with a generation expected
to top up national pensions to which they
themselves are unlikely to be entitled,
with little hope of owning their own
property unless their parents happen to
be rich, who therefore suffer a transfer of
wealth from themselves to older wealthier
landlords enjoying rising property values
and cheap mortgages. Millennials will
retire at an older age than people like me
and will inherit from their predecessors
the uncertainties of climate change, the
resulting refugee disaster, the decision to
leave Europe and a volatile geopolitical
scene. Dear fee-paying student, the least
I can do in return is give you decent feed-
back on your coursework.
Gareth Mitchell
Lecturer MSc Science Communication
and Science Media Production
Dear felix,
I just wanted to say that I really love some
of the articles you guys put together,
especially the Editor's note on the 2nd
page. I love how you guys are so truthful
about your feelings and opinions. I wish
I could express myself as freely and elo-
quently. I don't know how many student
readers actually write to felix and con-
gratulate for your hard work. I just hope
that this email will serve as a tiny encour-
agement! Sadly, I am graduating soon
and won't be getting felix free copies any-
more, but I hope that you guys, and I am
confident you will, continue to write more
and entertain or educate students here! :)

Bioengineering lecturer accidentally
shares exam paper with students
L
ast week a lecturer
accidentally shared
an upcoming exam
paper with their first-
year bioengineering
students.
The unfortunate gaffe
occurred during a revision
lecture for Molecules, Cells
and Processes.
During the lecture, a student
had a question that was not
covered in the section of the
revision session.
In order to locate the
relevant material, the lecturer
opened up the exam on the
desktop after having taken
out the HDMI connecting the
computer to the projector.
Unfortunately the lecture
was recorded via Panopto,
a College ICT service that
allows the recording of a
computer screen as well as
visual and audio content. The
system has been part of IC’s
the email.
The Panopto recording of the
revision session will be made
available again shortly. In
response to enquiries Martyn
Boutelle, Director of Courses
for Bioengineering said that “a
replacement exam paper was
fairly straightforward to write
as we did not need to devise
new problem-based questions
that need a lot of testing. The
questions were then reviewed
internally and by an External
Examiner, following our
normal procedures. The whole
process followed in response
to this issue was also approved
by an External Examiner.”
Boutelle added that on
Wednesday’s revision class
“all seemed well” and that
students seemed satisfied
following their exam on
Thursday.
teaching arsenal for years
now allowing staff to record
live lectures, special events,
tutorials and more.
When students got back
home, they found out that the
entire exam they’d be taking
the following week was online.
“Yeah naturally we realised
pretty quickly what her mistake
was,” said a student that
prefers to remain anonymous.
Following the realisation
of the mistake by the
Bioengineering department,
the Panopto recording of the
revision session was taken
down and an email was sent
out apologising for the fuck-
up.
“Several students had
viewed the recording by the
time we found out, and so the
paper and its questions can
therefore not be used as this
year’s exam and so another
paper will be written,” read
