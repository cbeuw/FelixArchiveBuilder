ere at Imperial,
any mention
of divestment
from fossil fuels
is largely met
with one of
two responses. The first is a
supportive but disheartened
reply along the lines of, “yeah,
it’s a nice idea but it will never
happen”. The second offers
a complete aversion to the
subject entirely, by changing
the topic of conversation. If
we are serious about tackling
climate change and securing
a safer future for society,
this atmosphere of apathy
needs to change. This is the
motivation behind the Divest
Imperial Campaign, aiming
to encourage the college to
stop investing in the fossil fuel
industry.
The team behind the
campaign want to encourage
open discussion on divestment
for students and staff alike. We
want to stop the conversation
from being shut down and
address the concerns the
campaign provokes. The
responses described above
don’t come from nowhere and
the former in particular has
some grounds for scepticism.
Imperial College has £5.4
million out of a £126 million
endowment fund directly
invested in the fossil industry.
This makes Imperial the third-
largest UK university investor
in fossil fuels. The difficulty
however, is that Imperial
receives a huge amount
research funding from the
fossil fuel industry. There are
a large number of people
working in the Royal School
of Mines, for example, whose
research solely depends on
this funding.
However, the source of
research funding should not
determine where Imperial
invest their funds. It is ludicrous
to believe that the only reason
the fossil fuel industry gives
money to Imperial is because
Imperial then re-invest back
into fossil fuels. The industry
provides funds for their own
benefit.
Fossil fuels are becoming
ever more difficult to extract
and process, making the
industry increasingly reliant on
the results from the research
they fund. They also receive
endless amounts of graduates
from the college year on year.
The running joke that there is
a secret tunnel running from
the chemical engineering
building at Imperial to Shell
headquarters speaks for itself.
The notion of divestment
at Imperial may seem
controversial, but when it
is placed next to the stated
missions and aims of the
college it becomes a lot
more palatable. The college
armaments firms. At King’s Col-
lege, the university idled on its
previous commitments to divest
until a small group of students
rapidly amplified pressure on
the university earlier this year.
The intense campaign cul-
minated in one PhD student,
Roger Hallam, undergoing a
hunger strike. Roger’s enor-
mous personal commitment
didn’t go unnoticed and after
14 days the university reaf-
firmed its commitment and
agreed to a full divestment
within five years.
The momentum in the UK for
divestment is clearly proceed-
ing in one direction: a situation
where our universities, some of
the most respected institutions
in the world, come together
to take a coherent and con-
structive stand against the
environmental destruction
perpetrated by the fossil fuel
industry. With 13 of its 24 mem-
bers holding some commitment,
divestment is becoming the
norm within the Russell Group,
as well as in London where
eight major universities in the
capital have already commit-
ted. For Imperial to maintain its
well-deserved reputation as an
institution tackling global chal-
lenges, fossil fuel divestment
must be a question of 'when'
rather than 'if'.

state their “mission is to
achieve enduring excellence
in research and education
in science… for the benefit
of society.” Is there anything
more beneficial to society
than taking action on climate
change? Yet by investing
in fossil fuels, the college
seems to be doing the
opposite. Burning fossil fuels
is the leading cause of climate
change and once they’re out
of the ground I doubt they
will be doing anything other
than being burnt. The college
further states that it “aims… to
address science challenges of
today and the future”. Fossil
fuel companies are known
funders of climate change
denialism and inaction, as well
as committing countless human
rights abuses. To effectively
address the challenges of
today and the future, Imperial
must stop investing in this
industry by simply applying
their aims and mission to their
investment policy.
As a finite resource, fossil
fuels will inevitably not be
around forever and only serve
as a short-term solution to
growing energy consumption.
As Imperial aims to “empower
graduates… to contribute
to the long-term needs of
society”, we welcome our
college to follow through on
this commitment.
Imperial are getting left
behind as many other UK
universities, such as King’s
College, are now committed
to divestment in fossil fuels.
The divestment campaign is
continuing to play a vital role
in encouraging Imperial to
catch up. Watch this space.

Conor O’Riordan wants to harness the
power of student activism
A
s the threat
of climate
c h a n g e
continues to
loom large
over society,
activists are turning to more
creative methods to encourage
the large-scale change that
we urgently need. Where
traditional political methods
have failed, divestment is now
making serious progress on
university campuses, in city
halls, and financial institutions
around the world.
The global divestment com-
mitment by universities now
stands at £540 billion and the
UK’s institutions alone account
for over £10 billion of this. A
surge in divestment movements
in the last two years now means
49 universities in the UK, more
than a third of the total, have
committed to divest from fossil
fuels. This jump towards a seri-
ous statement on fossil fuels by
our most respected institutions
is thanks in large part to the
many vocal and committed
student movements that began
across the country in 2013.
It was in Glasgow in late
2014 that fossil fuel divest-
ment gained its foothold in the
UK. After a year of student
campaigning the university
committed to divesting the
£18 million of assets which it
held in the fossil fuel industry,
making it the first in the UK to
do so. In the months preced-
ing Glasgow’s decision, SOAS
had frozen all of its fossil fuel
investments, and eventually
divested its £1.5 million six
months later making it the first
fossil-free university in London.
\\ In the past, divestment
has achieved meaningful
political change and is a
testament to the strength of
student activism here in the
UK \\
This rapid mobilisation of stu-
dents to call for divestment
would be very familiar to stu-
dents of previous generations.
In the 1970s and ‘80s, the
UK’s campuses were awash
with protests against the apart-
heid government of South
Africa where segregation of
black and white citizens was
enforced at every level of life
by the state. In response, the
National Union of Students,
supported by individual unions,
called for a systematic divest-
ment from the South African
economy.
In the UK, there were obvi-
ous targets for the campaign
and the NUS concentrated
on Barclays Bank. To begin
with, students divested at a
personal level, moving their
bank accounts and boycotting
Barclays. In the first two years
of the campaign, Barclays lost
10% of its market share in
student accounts, a product
seriously valued by retail bank-
ers. Over the next few years
Barclays would gradually
divest from specific projects in
South Africa which had been
repeatedly targeted by cam-
paigners in the UK and the U.S.
When Barclays eventually
sold their South African divi-
sion in 1986, its chairman
Sir Timothy Bevan admitted
that “world opinion counts. It
affects commerce, and world
opinion has changed a lot this
year”. Barclays had pulled
£200 million from South
Africa, and became the first
of many British companies
to divest from the South Afri-
can economy, although many
around the world, especially in
the U.S. had already done so.
Financial markets welcomed
the change of direction, seen
by this point as inevitable for
any public company with signif-
icant positions in South Africa,
and Barclays’ share price
enjoyed a modest increase fol-
lowing the announcement.
The global divestment move-
ment against apartheid was
certainly significant in placing
the political pressure on the
South African government
which eventually pushed them
into negotiations in the early
1990s. In this way, divestment
had achieved meaningful polit-
ical change and the campaign
is a testament to the strength of
student activism here in the UK.
While the current divest-
ment movement has serious
momentum at present, campus
campaigns in the UK face sig-
nificant challenges. Most of our
universities not only hold invest-
ments in the fossil fuel industry
through their endowments but
also receive funding directly
from the industry through indi-
vidual departments. The fossil
fuel industry relies on universi-
ties to provide large amounts
of intellectual and human cap-
ital through each new cohort
of graduates, as well as the
research needed to extract and
process fossil fuels in ever-more
difficult and harmful ways.
Activists have met these chal-
lenges head on and a variety
of tactics have been employed
in campaigns across the UK so
far. The University of Edinburgh
agreed to a partial divestment
in 2016, moving its money
out of three companies with
activities in coal and tar sands
oil, considered to be the most
harmful of fossil fuel depos-
its. Even this partial decision
was only taken after a 10-day
occupation of Edinburgh’s
finance offices by a group of
20 students. A year later, dis-
appointed in the university's
aversion to a full divestment,
a larger group went into an
overnight occupation of the
university quad. A small group
of students were singled out
for disciplinary action and the
occupation was cut short, but
the Edinburgh campaign con-
tinues in earnest.
A similar position was taken in
2015 at Oxford, who hold the
second largest endowment in
the UK. The university stopped
short of full divestment but
made a commitment to divest
from coal and tar sands. In
response, 70 prominent alumni
handed back their degrees and
the fossil free campaign contin-
ues towards fulls divestment. In
late 2015, Warwick agreed to
a full divestment in only one
year. This was followed by
divestment announcements
from UAL, Surrey, Oxford
Brookes and Sheffield. The fol-
lowing year, full commitments
were made by Queen Mary,
St. Andrews and Bristol while
partial commitments came
from Southampton, Newcastle
and Cambridge.
Here in London, Imperial
is quickly being left to play
catch-up up with our neigh-
bours. At the London School
of Economics a year-long
student campaign led to a
full divestment commitment in
2015. Alongside all fossil fuels,
LSE also agreed to divest from
