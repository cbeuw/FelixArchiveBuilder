Xavier Dolan, the critically-
acclaimed enfant terrible of
French-Canadian cinema, is set
to release his sixth feature film
later this year, but isn’t even in
his thirties. Léo Diaz lifts the lid
onhisoeuvre,andfindsoutwhat
makes his films tick
X
avier Dolan is
not your average
director. What
first sets him
apart is that he is
extremely young:
28 at the time of writing, he’s
already released six full-
length features. He directed
his first, I Killed My Mother,
when he was just 20, and his
2014 Mommy received the
Jury Prize at Cannes, along
with legendary director Jean-
Luc Godard’s Goodbye to
Language. However, while
his youth and remarkable
maturity must play a role, I
believe they cannot account
for the profoundly polarising
reactions his films elicit: when
watching a Dolan movie,
people either cry, or resent
that Dolan tells them to cry.
This is just me exaggerat-
ing since at least two of his
movies – I Killed My Mother
and Tom at the Farm – do
not truly feature overly
tear-jerking sequences like
Mommy does, for instance,
but the idea remains. Dolan
obviously wants people to
feel something when they
watch his movies, but the very
meaning of tear-jerking hints
at why some people instinc-
tively hate this: sentimentality.
I’ve noticed that critiques
thrown at his movies often use
the same words – artificial,
gratuitous, easy; all in nega-
tive terms – and I believe this
is because of sentimentality.
I will come back to that later,
but given a seventh feature
scheduled for release later
this year, (The Life and Death
of John F. Donovan) I wanted
to understand what his films
– despite at the surface being
about very different topics
– have in common; what jus-
tifies the repeated use of the
same adjectives in critiques.
Essentially, I wish to ask the
question: what makes a Dolan
is another feature his movies
have in common: they are
meant to touch people, to
change them, make them
feel emotions. No surprise
from a director whose
favourite movie is Titanic. He
even says it explicitly: “Au
make people remember him,
in a constant race against the
clock. This urgency means
emotions are not expressed
in the subtlest of ways, and
I think that is where the
accusations of sentimentality
originate. But where does this
sentimentality come from?
The first part of the answer
is that he conveys emotions
through stories. As such,
the stories he tells must be
general – or to use another,
blurrier, word: popular –
enough for everyone to
identify with, or at least be
immersed; that is why his
movies are dramas, even
spilling over into melodrama.
Mommy is the perfect exam-
ple, depicting the tumultuous
relation between Steve and
his mother, one that we know
doomed since the very first
shots of the movie: indeed,
what is more popular than
(family) relations?
This leads to the second
part: emotions are achieved
through characters. In a
similar manner to the stories
before, Dolan’s characters
are people you might see on

The most obvious theme
that runs through all six
features, at least partly, is
the way a son is seen by a
mother, whether the mother
is his own – most notably
in I Killed my Mother and
Mommy, depicted through
everyday relationships – or
of a friend’s (all the others).
Funnily enough, the recurrent
figure of the mother is played
by the same actresses: Anne
Dorval in three movies,
and Nathalie Baye in two
others. What other themes?
Homosexuality, obviously:
it’s explicitly present his first
two movies, I Killed My
Mother and Heartbeats, and
in Tom at the Farm where he
himself plays one of the main
characters; but it’s also a thin
backdrop in It’s Only the End
of the World, although it is
not explicit in the Jean-Luc
Lagarce text from which the
movie is adapted. However,
I do not believe these themes
explain why his movies are
polarising.
Instead, what I think is
responsible for such reactions

to identify to his
characters so much
that they become
archetypes, emptied
of personality so

ému” (“In cinema, I need
to be moved”). But, more
importantly, I believe this
goes back to his young age
and early acclaim: within his
personality and his movies
there is an urgency to touch,
to say what he has to say and
