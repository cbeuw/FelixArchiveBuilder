Andrada Balmez explains how we’ve only just discovered 467 million hectares of forest
S
cientists have
been missing
the forest for the
trees; literally, it
turns out. A team
of international
scientists have found that
dryland forest cover could
be 40% to 47% higher
than previously estimated.
This corresponds to 467
million hectares (Mha) of
forest that have never been
reported before (and this is
approximately 250 times the
size of Wales or seven times
the surface of France). The
report increases the current
estimates of global forest
by at least 9%, the team
reported.
Dryland biomes cover
40% of the Earth’s surface
and from the Mediterranean
Sea to central India, from
South America to the Russian
Federation, they contain some
of the most threatened ecosys-
tems, including seven out of
the 25 biodiversity hotspots.
Previous estimates of
dryland forests have been
incongruous due to inconsist-
ency in methods and reliance
on national cover statistics.
For example different studies
would use satellite images
varying in resolution, different
mapping approaches and
even different definition of
what constitutes a forest, now
defined as “land spanning
an area of more than 0.5ha
with a tree cover over 10%
that is not predominantly used
for agriculture or urban land
use, as well as land on which
tree cover is temporarily
under 10%, but is expected
to recover”. Moreover,
the study also considered
non-tropical dry forests which
hadn’t been mapped using
satellite imagery before. This
latest estimate used global
satellite data from Google
Earth, with high spatial
resolution imagery. Even
so, distinguishing trees from
shrubs, disentangling reflec-
tance and shadows proved
to be difficult sometimes, the
researchers warn.
This estimation also solves
a field conundrum: the
dissonance between land
use and land cover. Land
use is employed to describe
areas that are used by man
(urban, agricultural, indus-
trial) whereas land cover
describes natural ecosystems.
In the past, estimates of land
use and land cover didn’t
quite add up to our global
land surface. But this work
has managed to bridge the
disparity.
In the future we could get
a much clearer idea of how
much carbon is stored in
forests. At the moment our
estimates are not as accurate
as they could be due to the
discrepancies in the forest
coverage, but if we want
to construct better models
\\ This is
approximately 250
times the size of
Wales \\
in order to know what we
should expect from climate
change, we ought to improve
those estimates. Currently, the
rate of deforestation predicts
that rainforests might disap-
pear in the next 100 years,
possibly replaced by dryland
forests as the dryland biomes
will extend.

Lizzie Riach discusses the subtleties of a meteor apocalypse
N
ew computer
simulations
have found
that if an
asteroid
impacted
Earth, humans would be more
likely to die from the blast
itself, and not the subsequent
effects it would have on the
planet. A comforting thought.
The shock waves, extreme
winds and falling bits of space
rock would probably deal the
surrounding humanity its final
blow. That is, according to
recent computer simulations
conducted by planetary
scientists lead by Clemens
Rumpf.
One of the simulations
targeted London specifically,
simulating a 200-metre-wide
space rock hurtling at a
speed of 20 kilometres per
second. The results indicated
that around two thirds of all
suggested fatalities would
be a result of shock waves
and extreme winds carrying
debris.
The range of damage
seen in simulations was, as
you’d expect, very broad,
with some impacts killing
over 117 million people, and
others posing no threat at
all, with smaller space rocks
exploding in the atmosphere
before reaching the ground.
Tsunamis became the main
danger for asteroids landing
in water (accounting for
around 70-80% of the total
deaths from each of these
impacts). Despite this, the sim-
ulations showed land impacts
to be much more catastrophic
for life than those landing in
the oceans, due to the likely
proximity of dense human
populations.
But you can rest easy. In
reality, fatal asteroids are
very rare. Meteors that slip
through, like the 20 metre
wide rock that shook the
Russian city of Chelyabinsk
in 2013 are predicted to
only frequent Earth every
century. Impacts like the one
suspected of driving the dino-
saurs to extinction 66 million
years ago are believed to
only occur once every 100
million years.
But, as is the nature of
most natural phenomena,
meteors can’t be predicted.
Astronomers are constantly
scouting the skies for potential
dangers. Others ask the
question: so what if we were
in the line of fire? How would
we divert this space rock?
Proposals include countering
the asteroid with a high speed
spacecraft to throw it off
course, or initiating nuclear
explosion to propel it away
(the “Asteroid impact avoid-
ance” wiki page highlights
multiple strategies in detail!)
The simulations are not with-
out criticism. Gareth Collins,
a planetary scientist working
here at Imperial, suggests the
published findings could be
misleading. With a 60-metre-
wide rock, very few impacts
could kill millions, with the
majority killing none. The
average is therefore greatly
inflated by a few exceptional
circumstances – it all depends
on where it lands, Collins
maintains: “you have to put it
in perspective.”
