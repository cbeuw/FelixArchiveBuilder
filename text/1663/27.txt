etween the 31st
of March and 8th
of April, Imperial
College Yacht
Club (ICYC) took
part in the largest,
student-led competition
in France: the 49th
Course
Croisière EDHEC (CCE).
Gathering more than 3000
students, this year the CCE
was held in Arzon in the
south of French Brittany.
ICYC attended with a team of
seven students: three French,
two English and two Chinese
sailors.
We left London for ten days,
starting the adventure with a
rather long and tiring twen-
ty-hour bus journey to cross
from England to the French
Far West. After a night in the
bus we set foot in Arzon, a
fine coastal city at the heart
of French sailing, the bay of
Quiberon. We chose to com-
pete in the Grand Surprise
Class, a one-design class
where every team races on
identical boats. The first day
was dedicated to training and
getting acquainted with the
boat as most of us had never
stepped foot on a Grand Sur-
prise. Though we had trained
in the Solent before the race,
we quickly realised how steep
the learning curve was and
how fierce the competition
would be, as most boats were
crewed by well-trained teams
or even had professional
skippers.
The competition started in
very light wind and bright
sunshine, where the battle
for speed and boat trimming
were key. Unfortunately, we
lost too much on the upwind
legs to allow us to compete
for the first spots. With some
good manoeuvres and
superior downwind speed,
we gained some ground back
on the fleet to finish 16th
, 19th
,
and 20th
. Not the ideal start
as we came back exhausted
and sunburnt, but hoping that
as we improved as a team
and on the boat, we might
climb up the rankings over the
rest of the week.
The wind picked up on the
second day for the coastal
races, for which we had to
tour the Bay of Quiberon.
With wind speed increasing
and strong tidal currents,
strategy and tactics had
added complexity. The first
race was marked with fun
competition from the Spanish
of FNB which we overtook
under spinnaker after 45
minutes of match-racing. On
the second race, we had a
very good start and turned in
the top ten at the first mark.
Unfortunately, a boat refused
our right of way after the
mark forcing us into a crash
gybe and left us on a collision
course with a fishing boat
ploughing through the fleet.
After another gybe to give
the trawler a comfortable
safety margin, we had lost
too much to put in a high
placing. Sometimes, racing
is not just about you and you
learn hard lessons about
sportsmanship – or the lack
thereof.
The wind dropped drasti-
cally on the 3rd
and 4th
days
accompanied by challenging
wind shifts and sudden gusts.
We witnessed incredible
situations where the whole
fleet, moving at less than
0.5kt, would converge at
a mark, with boats gently
crashing onto each other and
crews resorting to eating,
drinking and playing music
whilst still competing. It was
the opportunity to befriend
and chat with other sailors,
while some went for a swim
or climbed up the mast. They
eventually cancelled racing
on the 5th
day due to a lack
of wind. Unfortunately, we
did not qualify for the finals
on the last day which were
won for the second time in a
row by KPMG. Overall, ICYC
finished 14th
in the student
general ranking, the first and
only British crew against the
French Armada.
However, CCE is not just
about sailing for the week.
Only a third of students
attending compete through
sailing, the rest battling in
trail-running, canoeing or
beach sports competitions.
The event is organized
around a whole village
created just for the occasion
which we had time to tour,
enjoying the sponsors’ good-
ies and the massive parties
thrown under the big tent
each evening. We have to
thank the wonderful organiza-
tion team for the overall event
and the EDHEC international
team for the very welcoming
atmosphere and delicious
food parties presented by
each country. Our bunga-
low was in the middle of the
international village, leading
us to meet sailors from Turkey,
Croatia and many other
European nations. Some of
them even invited us to race
in their home country and we
all came back with twice as
many friends. We are looking
forward to repeating this
experience next year for the
50th
CCE, to be held in Brest,
France.
Imperial College Yacht Club
(ICYC) is the only student-led
yacht club in London, focus-
ing on yacht racing and
cruising. The club is actively

experience levels. To find

A
t 7:30am on
Friday the
28th
of April,
Imperial’s
finest runners
assembled
outside SAF ready to embark
on what was to be one of the
greatest weekends of their
lives. They hit the road at
8am, with Eurotrash blazing
out of the notorious Union
minibus speakers through the
streets of London with the
destination set for Nijmegen
in the Netherlands (not
Holland) for the world’s
largest relay race: the
45th
Batavierenrace. The
Batavierenrace is an around-
the-clock, 25-stage relay
which takes more than 8500
runners across 175 km of
Dutch countryside to the finish
at the University of Twente
just outside Enschede.
The journey itself was
fairly eventful, with several
traffic jams, multiple dabs and
plenty of team-bonding. Club
snake, Greg Jones, was set
to run the first leg, and the
unexpected delays left him
just half an hour to warm up,
apply the face paint and get
in the zone for the start at
10:30pm. Back at race HQ,
the remainder of the team
were preparing for the main
race which would begin at
1am. The late arrival meant
there was a scramble to find
somewhere still open to get
food. Thankfully, MacDon-
ald’s came to the rescue to
provide the widely recognised
pre-race nutrition choice of
Big Macs and fries.
The first leg was a stan-
dalone event and there was a
short break before the main
night shift kicked off at 1am,
with last-minute stand-in Alex
Baldwin masterfully handling
the challenge of surprise hills
and a competitive field. Each
runner during the race was
accompanied by a cyclist for
support and encouragement.
Zhen Wang-Koh kicked off
the first bike leg with Alex.
At this point the team split
up to conserve energy. The
night team sped off in the
minibus to chase Alex and
Zhen into the night, while the
remaining athletes attempted
to sleep on the floor of the
sports hall. Over the next
few hours the brave Imperial
athletes raced against the
cold and dark under the
Dutch night sky, awestruck
by not only the stars but the
trail of bike lights accompa-
nying the runners through the
dark fields. Charlotte Barratt
notably completed two legs;
at 2 and 4am! The route
briefly crossed into Germany
before coming to an end
around 5am, at which point
the exhausted night-shifters
passed out in the bus, having
successfully completed the
first third of the race.
Meanwhile the remainder
of the team had their alarms
set for 4:40am to drive to
the start of the morning shift
in the town of Ulft. After an
early-morning rave to Gay
Bar and a feast of peanut-but-
ter and jam sandwiches the
morning team were ready
to go for the 07:15 restart,
with a borderline-hypother-
mic Zhen forgoing sleep to
join the morning crew to run
for a second time (she still
managed to beat both of
her predicted times!). After
multiple storming runs, some
carefully executed changeo-
vers and leg-winning runs by
both Liam Smith and Fergus
Johnson, the team reunited in
Barchem at noon for the start
of the afternoon shift before
the grand finale.
The miles and final few legs
flew by for the afternoon
team, despite many running
for a second time. Rob
Salawa managed a 10km
PB on his 10.7km leg and
Charlotte brought the team
into Enschede – running for
the third time, having stepped
in to cover for injuries. The
stage was then set for Jenny
Lea and trip organiser/club
legend Matt Douthwaite to
complete the final two legs of
the race and bring the sweaty
vest to the finish line and
allow the party to begin.
Overall, the team finished
17th
out of 320 teams,
although this included three
dubious 15-minute penalties
for removing the vest/baton
too early. Without these pen-
alties, the team finished in a
total time of 12:17:01 - placing
in an even more impressive
4th
!
The sleep-deprived team
then set about applying
the most outrageous neon
clothing and paint, along
with squad headbands and
finger lights, allowing the
team to perfectly blend in
with the Dutch locals who did
not dress up at all. The team
raved hard and for as long as
they could before returning
to sleep in another very hard-
floored Dutch sports hall.
Anyone who thought that
everyone would be too tired
for any banter on the journey
back was seriously mistaken.
Bridges were applauded,
breath was held for passing
through tunnels, Rubik’s cubes
were solved, thumbs up were
enthusiastically waved at
locals accompanied with cries
of “YAAAAAAS”, and tunes
were once again booming
through the speakers in the
queue for the Channel Tunnel.
The trip was a big success
and Imperial Cross Country
and Athletics looks forward to
returning to the Netherlands
again next year.
