A
fter a
tumultuous
five years in
development
hell, Neil
Gaiman’s post-
modern blend of Americana
and folklore has finally found
its way to TV courtesy of
Starz and Amazon. American
Gods, an adaptation of
Gaiman’s 2001 novel by the
same name, is at its heart an
examination of faith and the
ever-changing nature of the
altars at which we worship.
Being familiar with Gaiman’s
Sandman mythos but never
having read American Gods
myself, I approached the
series not quite knowing
what to expect. What I’ve
experienced in the first two
episodes, however, has me
keen to see more.
American Gods follows
Shadow Moon, a convict
released early upon news
of his wife’s death, as he is
recruited by the enigmatic Mr.
Wednesday as a bodyguard.
Wednesday, at first glance
a simple con-man, quickly
reveals himself to be one of
the old Gods inclined on start-
ing a war with the new ones;
science, technology, and the
like. The episodes themselves
open with a vignette; each
chronicling the arrival of
a people and their god to
America, and simultaneously
exploring what Gaiman
believes to be one of the
core facets of the American
bedrock.
These openings are
excellently crafted, with
tight pacing that is echoed
throughout the main bodies
of the episodes. A switch to a
more ‘cinematic’ aspect ratio,
coupled with a voice-over
helps differentiate these from
the rest of the show. Unfortu-
nately, the narration can be
a bit verbose and self-impor-
tant, but this is always one
of the slight risks with, and
charms of, Gaiman’s works.
Particularly praiseworthy is
the introduction of the West
African trickster god Anansi,
a powerfully performed
scene that excellently sets
up the episode’s running
theme. Specifically, how one
makes the decision between
submitting to oppression or
fighting it, even at the cost
of one’s life. The smash cut
ending to this vignette is used
well to this effect. In fact, the
show really seems to revel in
Surreal is the new real.\\ Starz
using smash cuts. While this
might normally feel jarring
and off-putting, here it serves
to accentuate the surrealist
imagery embraced by the
series.
Wild colour palettes, and
thematically in-tune scoring
help to further set the scene.
In particular, the soundtrack
in the first quarter of the first
episode creates a pervasive
sense of unease in the viewer
that matches well the sense
of unease in the protagonist’s
mind. The visuals, for their
part, are simply sublime.
Clearly, ludicrous amounts of
money have been thrown at
the production. This is a wel-
come necessity, as otherwise
the series would have lost
much of its dramatic gravitas,
given how much it relies on
abstract imagery. The conflu-
ence of these elements does
an excellent job of realising
the Gods, and boy are they
terrifying.
Further amplifying the
presence of the Gods are,
of course, the performances
themselves. By now we
expect nothing short of excel-
lence from Ian McShane, and
still he manages to surprise.
McShane’s versatility is on
display here, as he fills out
the variety that might be
expected from a con man.
Orlando Jones also deserves
special mention for his turn as
Anansi. He manages to leave
a lasting impression with only
a brief appearance so far.
In addition, Ricky Whittle
proves a more than capable
lead; reacting pretty much
how you’d
expect
You’re never too old for a road trip.\\ Starz
a sane man discovering the
insanity of the world to react.
These first two episodes do
an excellent job of pulling
in viewers and keeping
their interest. At points, they
can be a bit schizophrenic,
throwing a lot of disparate
concepts at the viewer with
no clear indication that they
will be explained later. How-
ever, this is more forgiveable
in the age of binge watching
than it would have been in
the past. Television shows,

ster god Anansi \\
specifically long form dramas
have become increasingly
serialized. For its part, Amer-
ican Gods keeps a measured
pace, and as a consequence,
doesn’t frustrate or confound
the viewer with too much
information. With the excep-
tion of the vignettes, it also
manages to avoid relying
on exposition dumps, to its
credit. Explanations are not
provided on a platter, but
there are more than enough
clues for astute viewers to
put things together for them-
selves. As Wednesday says
at one point, he’s “easing [us]
into it”.
If there’s one thing that
really bothers me about the
series, it’s the title sequence.
It’s loud, garish, and an
assault on the senses in all
the wrong ways. I can, at
least, appreciate the
intent behind it; the
evocation of tradi-
tional tribal and
religious chants.
Minor gripe
aside, the series
is definitely worth
watching, and
it’s fair to say that
American Gods
has definitely made
a believer out of me.
