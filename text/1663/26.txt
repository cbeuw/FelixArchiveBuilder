This week you divest
from revising. Imperial
will surely bow down
to your demands.

This week you walk
into the felix office
drunk and proceed to
record inappropriate
comments about
donuts. Some things
are not meant to be
on record.
This week you realise
you share the same
future as fossil fuels.
It’s pretty bleak mate.
Maybe you should
divest.
This week you’re
Russia. No one likes
you.
This week you’re
Tessa Davey and you
insisted on a ten page
Eurovision spread.
You’ve given the editor-
in-chief angina. Well
done.
This week you re-do
your Tinder profile
and add watersports
to your interests. You
immediately realise
it was a mistake. Or
was it?
This week you’re France.
Yes. That’s the joke.
This week you’re
Macron but you
desperately want to be
a Macaron.
This week you’re
Queen’s Tower.
Someone used you to
whack open a melon
the other day. That’s
the most human contact
you’ve had in years.
This week you’re a
Bioeng lecturer who
likes flashing their
students. Flashing
exam answers that is.
This week you’re thrilled
to see felix finally covering
the things that matter.
#Eurovision
This week you’re the
UK. No one likes you
either.

Chris
Dear Chris,
I’ve been invited to a few Eurovision parties this Saturday
and I’m not entirely sure what to do. For starters I’m not the
biggest fan of the Europop extravaganza. I mean I’m all for
the oiled-up semi-clad men but ideally I’d be watching the
whole thing on mute and I don’t think that’s likely to happen
at a Eurovision party.
If I was to go, I’d probably do a Eurovision-party crawl.
At one of the parties there’s this cute guy that may or may
not be into me. But everyone else there is a bit of a douche.
What do I do?
Best,
Prof Alex Johnson
Dear Alex,
First of all I would like to say what an honour
it is to have a professor write to our column,
albeit a bit inappropriate perhaps? Like do
you pick up the paper? You realise there’s
naked students in it every week right? Line
crossed maybe?
Thankfully, I’m all for crossing lines. And lucky
for you I’m all for crossing people too. This is
really what you need to do. You can’t make
everyone happy, so you might as well embrace
your dark side and fuck. Shit. Up.
So let’s put your needs first. What do you
really want? I’d say your first priority is clearly
getting some (you thirsty academic you). First
stop: cute-guy party. Go in early. Come on
strongly. If he’s indifferent fuck off and pro-
ceed to the next party. If he reciprocates, you
HOROSCOPES
shove him into the first room/closet/storage
area/surface you find and sex him (obviously
consensually). Ten minutes later you exit, loos-
ened up, smiling and waving goodbye to those
ass-hats you didn’t like anyway and move on
to the next party. Make sure on exit to say
loud and clear something along the lines of:
“This party blows. I’m going somewhere fun.
Later.”
Second stop: the most proximal party. Enter
unapologetically. You were a ‘Maybe’ on the
Facebook event page so having you is a privi-
lege. Test the waters, see if you’re having fun.
If not rinse, lather, repeat.
Treat this as a general going out guide.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
