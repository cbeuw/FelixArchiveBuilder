A
gay fantasia
on national
themes” is
the label
Tony Kushner
gave his play
Angels in America, which is
being staged at the National
theatre for the first time
since the 90s; and what a
fantasia it is. Grounded in
1980s New York, the action
sprawls across reality and
delusion, from Salt Lake
City to Washington DC,
from Antarctica to Heaven,
dancing on the edge of utter
madness but never stumbling.
Tony Kushner’s writing is
bold, profound, and urgent,
with frequent bright sparks of
comedic brilliance. Even on
the occasions the script spirals
into dense segments of over-
the acting. Nathan Lane is
incandescent as Roy Cohn,
a real-life lawyer who
desperately tries to deny his
homosexuality even as he
slowly dies from Aids. His
energy never wanes, even
across hours of turning purple
in the face from bellowing
Malcolm Tucker-esque profan-
ity at anyone who will listen.
In any other production,
perhaps Lane could’ve stolen
the show but here he is given
a run for his money from his
castmates, which seem to be
giving the performance of
their lives.
Denise Gough playing
Harper Pitt, a woman who
is verging constantly on
the edge of psychosis, is
funny, heart-breaking and
ultimately uplifting. Nathan
Stewart-Jarett, familiar from
Channel 4’s Misfits lights up
the stage as the witty, warm
and wise Belize, often the
sole voice of reason amongst
a group of characters where
each is more neurotic than the
last. Amanda Lawrence as
The Angel is truly magnificent,
filled with the manifest dignity
that Kushner demands of the
role in the stage notes to the
play.
As for Andrew Garfield,
who plays Prior Walter, a
drag queen who finds his life
irrevocably changed when
he finds a Karposi’s Sarcoma
lesion on his arm, this is surely
a career-defining perfor-
mance. He is impossible to
look away from even when
his character slips out of the
spotlight. It’s a tender, camp,
humorous performance which
matures over the course of
the play. There are moments
early on where the character-
ization drifts ever so slightly
into the realm of stereotype,
but perhaps this too, is
intended – after all, Angels in
America is just as much about
types of people as it is about
living, breathing humans.
At its core, Kushner’s
polemic is a searing account
of the Aids crisis, a modern
plague, and the destruction
it wreaked over the lives of
young gay men who found
themselves as patients with
terminal diagnoses or the
carers of dying friends and
lovers in their 20s and 30s.
Recent healthcare reforms in
America have fuelled fears
anew that the new admin-
istration will mark a return
of government inaction as
epidemics rage on. Much
of the political art created in
the shadow of Reagan and
Thatcherite politics seems all
too relevant now. One need
not delve too deep to look for
parallels; the morally bank-
rupt, corrupt, Roy Cohn was
Donald Trump’s legal advisor.

arching philosophising, this
cast and crew make it soar.
Director Marianne Elliot,
who in 2011 won a Tony
Award for War Horse, has
created a theatrical spec-
tacle to be marvelled over.
Columns of fire erupt inches
from the audience, hospital
rooms rise from the bowels
of the stage, neon shining
ladders are thrown down
from Heaven, New York
apartments transfigure them-
selves into the snow drifts of
Antarctica and back again all
under a deconstructed space-
age cathedral dome. Special
mention go to production
designers Finn Caldwell and
Nick Barnes who have fash-
ioned The Angel's “steel grey
wings” from huge feathered
contraptions that are oper-
ated by balletic puppeteers.
As magnificent as the stag-
ing is, it never overshadows
conservative movement that
sees ‘progress’ as a dirty
word. Yet, whilst its nearest lit-
erary relative, Larry Kramer’s
The Normal Heart, also about
the Aids crisis in New York, is
sustained on a steady stream
of righteous anger, Kushner’s
Angels ultimately takes a
more hopeful stance. It is an
ode, as the Thomas Lux poem
goes, to the unbroken world
that is coming.
On press night, the end of
the second part, Perestroika,
received a thunderous
standing ovation. It was in
no small part a reaction to
the final scene which Andrew
Garfield makes magical in a
way that is difficult to convey.
Speaking to the Hollywood
Reporter at the Oscar
Actors Roundtable earlier
in the year, Garfield spoke
eloquently of the importance
of creating art that speaks
to marginalised communities
who are desperately looking
for media that represents
them, that recognises them:
Angels in America is one of
those rare gems. Go and see
it.
