o Trump’s sister didn’t
win in the French
elections and I can’t
quite explain what
happened. Perhaps
those spineless cheese-
eating surrender monkeys weren’t
drinking enough Kool-Aid, or for
some reason they managed not to
be manipulated by racial rhetoric.
This is just one of the many reasons
that France is so much weaker
than the English-speaking world
– why couldn’t they just follow
right-wing populism like the rest of
us? Why couldn’t they just listen to
their biased media and bask in the
mutual hatred of Muslims and ethnic
minorities? It’s almost as if they don’t
want to see the destruction of the
European Union and the Western
economy and want unity in their
country instead. Which is weird
considering their motto is égalité,
fraternité, and racismé.
I can only assume that the large
body of water between Great
Britain and lesser france must have
kept the ‘take our country back’
vibes subdued which is very much
their loss. To be quite honest I am
still waiting to take my country
back. I honestly thought that a
vote for Brexit would be a vote for
a strong and stable Britain, but
it’s almost as if everything that we
voted for takes time. You know
what though? If I have to wait to
have everyone that wasn’t born
in this country deported, then by
Jove I’ll wait – I already have a
stringent check-list for when we
start purging the country. Basically
we ask each person where they’re
from if they have dubiously tinted
skin, and then when they give the
answer that’s on their birth certif-
icate, we ask “but where are you
really from?” and then put them on
the next ferry to Macron-land.
In other news I’m currently
looking for a job and it seems that
there may be an opening with
the Trump administration. I am
of course talking about the FBI
position which may possibly stay
vacant for a couple of months
to a couple of years depending
on how long he can avoid being
investigated. It would probably be
easier if he could just grab the gen-
itals of an entire organisation but
that would be pretty gay. I think,
if anything, I am overqualified for
the position: I take commands very
well and never question anything
that Breitbart publishes; I’m as
straight as they come (despite
having that secret with my uncle
Ted); and I’m fluent in Russian.
I
f I am ever in doubt about
what to write in this column,
all I have to do is read either
The Canary or my friend’s art
history Facebook page, and
then I find an issue that is the
pettiest waste of time, and then
dedicate 400 words to this issue,
with full knowledge that each issue
of felix is sent to the British Library
and this nonsense will be archived
for all of human history.
I just recently realised, unfor-
tunately, that I will be out of the
country for the general election
owing to the fact there are too
many Gambian children who need
my white saviour soul to help build
their schools. Also I’ve noticed how
I’ve not been receiving as many
super likes on my Tinder account
with my current photo of me taking
ayahuasca in Colombia. This
suggests that I probably need a pic
of me with some African children
worshipping me above my caption
of “Spreading peace and love and
thighs”.
So it looks as though Jeremy will
once again provide all the answers
to the numerous problems this
country has by spending money on
– literally everything that people
want – without any plan for where
this money will come from. Perhaps
David Cameron dropped a couple
of billions down the sofa when he
was in 10 Downing Street and just
forgot about it. It’s possible that
they can tax all the rich people
in the country and all they’ll have
to do is get the approval of the
hundreds of rich people in the
House of Commons and the House
of Lords. Frankly if Corbyn’s ascent
to power isn’t the second coming
of Christ or the rebirth of true
communism I think myself and the
vegan consortium of Britain will be
extremely disappointed. We will
feel as though we have pumped all
our hopes and dreams into a fan-
tastical idealist. I mean if this fails,
I’ll just move to Vermont and wait
until 2020 for Bernie to rise from
the ashes. I mean yeah he didn’t
win, but there’s no way an old
white socialist could beat a woman
– it’s just the natural order of white
liberal priorities. If he’s against a
Hispanic candidate then I think
Bernie will probably just have to
retire that dream forever and get
ready to die.
I think after this election, I will
decide to move my focus away
from politics, and instead put my
time and energy into trying to
carve out a career as a successful
podcaster. Unfortunately all the
good child murder cases have
been investigated to death, but I’m
playing around with developing
a hummus review show. It will
almost definitely be sponsored by
Squarespace. Please support my
Patreon. I don’t want to work.
My interest is politics
will go up in flames
with Corbyn but look
out for my podcast
Jonathan Masters is looking for
new ventures and unemployment
opportunities.
Fuck off France
Monathan Jasters is disappointed
that the French are failing to pull
their weight
