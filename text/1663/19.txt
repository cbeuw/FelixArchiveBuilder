William Oldroyd’s Lady Macbeth is an explora-
tion of Victorian social codes, and their claustro-
phobic effects \\ Allstar
Lady
Macbeth
By Lawrence Good
H
ow far would
you be willing
to go to assert
your freedom?
Who and what
would you risk
to pursue your own desires?
Facing these questions is
Katherine, the protagonist
of Lady Macbeth, who,
having been ‘bought’ to be
the wife of a wealthy old
man, finds passion through
an affair with a stable boy
named Sebastian. Adapted
from Nikolai Leskov’s 1865
novel Lady Macbeth of the
Mtsensk, writer Alice Birch
and director William Oldroyd
transpose the setting to
Victorian Yorkshire, trapping
their characters in a bleak
and unrelenting world,
determined to impose itself
on those contained within its
grasp.
Florence Pugh, as Katherine,
is fantastically controlled yet
expressive. Lady Macbeth is
at its funniest and best when
she displays her myriad of
querulous and defiant faces,
hinting none too subtly to the
men that bought, control, and
patronise her where they can
stick it. Yet Pugh’s acting is
much more complete, as she
shows not only Katherine’s
determination to get what she
wants, namely Cosmo Jarvis’s
Sebastian, but also the fear
and anger that drives her
to commit ever more drastic
acts to keep him. Pugh allows
Katherine’s subversive nature
to pierce through the 19th
century decorum, bringing
energy whenever she’s on the
screen, and sparks whenever
she’s spoiling for a fight.
Sebastian embodies the
trope that the best way to
get laid in Victorian England
was to be a handsome and
hulking farm hand. By this
metric, Jarvis is eminently
suitable for the role, though
he does have some acting
chops too. He conveys well
the line Sebastian walks
between raffish and danger-
ous, and his later descent into
emotional confliction. Yet, for
all this, Sebastian never feels
worth the lengths and effort
Katherine goes to to keep
him. More convincing reasons
arrive in the form of her new
husband (Paul Hilton) and
her father-in-law (Christopher
Fairbank). The first feeble and
the second menacing, they
from a controlling pair whose
attempted vice-like grip on
Katherine gives her ample
opportunity to fight back, as
she throws off their insistence
she “sit inside with her prayer
book”. Many of the other
characters are caught in the
entailing crossfire, most nota-
bly the maid Anna (Naomi
Ackie) and young Teddy
(Anton Palmer).
Ari Wegner’s arresting
cinematography provides
a rich and alluring texture,
in the process proving that
brown, with its many and var-
ious hues and shades, need
not be a dull colour. Here it
exacerbates the claustropho-
bic effect of the walls, locking
Katherine in, and highlighting
how society restricts her. Lady
Macbeth uses this to show the
relationships between choice
and power, as well as control
and resistance, and explore a
much larger scope, examining
the line between asserting
your owns freedoms and
abusing those of others.
A
young Korean
woman arrives
at a vast
mansion, taking
up position as
handmaiden
to the niece of a wealthy
aristocrat. So begins this erotic,
psychological thriller, a taut
and captivating exploration of
deceit, power, and sexuality
in Japanese-ruled Korea. The
latest film from director Park
Chan-Wook, who brought us the
uber-violent neo-noir Oldboy, he
smashes the ball out of the park
once again.
Loosely adapted from Sarah
Waters’ novel Fingersmith, the
film plunges us into a world
brimming with lies, love, and
betrayal; we are forced to
second-guess the motives of
each and every character. In
many ways this is a heist movie,
the target nominally a vast
fortune, but in reality the control
of the game, as the characters
lead each other (as well as the
audience) on a merry dance of
hoodwinking and power plays.
Each character has their own
desires, strengths, and shortcom-
ings, but Park never quite lets
us fully grasp what these truly
are. The resulting uncertainty
kept me hooked; as my entire
understanding of the power
dynamics was liable to invert
at a moment's notice, I found
myself unable to look away, or
for my mind to wander. What’s
more remarkable was how at
each moment the reality I was
being presented with seemed
inevitable and incontrovertible,
only to be dashed and reshaped
scene after scene, a remarkable
feat of storytelling.
This control over story progres-
sion is matched by the absolute
precision of the camerawork.
It allows the film to convey
not only the ominous feel of
unfolding events and apparent
calamities, but to enhance and
elevate this overarching inevita-
bility. The set design is similarly
immaculate, often seeming to
reflect the status of characters
occupying them – sometimes
small and strapping, at others
expansive and powerful. The
overall visual effect is wonderful,
a powerful evocation of mood,
drawing out reactions in a vis-
ceral fashion.
Sex scenes are notoriously
difficult to pull off, usually either
lacking frisson or descending
into self -parody. This is preva-
lent even in films centred around
sexuality, notably in Abdellatif
Kechiche’s 2013 Blue is the
Warmest Colour, a sex-based
bildungsroman which presented
itself as an exploration and
evocation of desire, but ended
up as an excuse for the director
to conjure up a 3-hour reel of
his lesbian fantasies – That it
takes itself so seriously gives a
film an inadvertently funny spin,
and not in a good way. For The
Handmaiden however, Park
Chan-Wook overwhelmingly
gets the balance right, with only
a few moments held on for too
long, or burning too bright.
The Handmaiden is a rare
beast – thrilling, yet thoughtful.
It has lingered in my mind long
since I saw it, and is a film very
much worth watching. Brought
to life by a combination of taut
writing, precise directing and
nuanced acting, it breathes a
cinematic life that is at once
charismatic yet subtle, entranc-
ing yet restrained.

the street, who you might
talk to everyday. For instance,
it is Dolan in I Killed My
Mother, playing a teen
looking for himself; or it is
Dolan in Heartbeats, chasing
his crush; and it is also Dolan
in Tom at the Farm, who
recently lost his lover. I think
the trouble with his movies
begins here: Dolan wants us
to identify with his characters
so much that they become
archetypes, emptied of
personality so that we can fill
in the void with our own emo-
tions. The way Dolan builds
his characters is symptomatic
of this: he collects pictures of
clothes, atmospheres, hair-
cuts, and together they define
a character’s personality. It is
at this point that people start
to call his work easy, cliché…
The third part is that emo-
tions are achieved through
music. My absolute favourite
feature of his films, music
is the main reason I am
fascinated by his work. Like
in many other movies, music
choice is used to signify emo-
tions, but Dolan pushes this
to an extreme: he is known
to have written some scripts
literally from music that has
inspired him. More than any
other director I know, the
tunes literally tell you how to
feel; everything is focused on
the music, which is sometimes
extremely loud compared to
the rest of the soundtrack. An
obvious example of this is the
dream sequence featured in
Mommy – as soon as it starts,
the tone is set by violins: we
need to be sad, right now.
But what I love most is that he
has the most amazing music
choices, which have been
described as “shameless”:
O-Zone’s Dragostea Din Tei,
Oasis’ Wonderwall, Eiffel
65’s Blue (Da Ba Dee), along
with lesser-known acts such
as The Knife or Moderat. If,
when reading one of these
titles, you thought they were
cliché or had been heard
a million times, you are
perfectly right; but when you
watch it, they sound great,
building insane climaxes, and
makes the scene memorable
in the best way.
This result is in part made
possible by the final element
of Dolan’s technique: emo-
tions are achieved through
the use of specific effects serv-
ing aesthetic choices. And
this gets to the core of what
annoys many people: Dolan
use of technique to get results
can hardly be described as
subtle. He uses these tech-
niques many times in his
work, and even within
the same movie, to the
point they become
gimmicks through
repetition; he even
pushes that use further
by layering them on top
of one another: too much
is never enough.
His most divisive choice –
but also the most beautiful I
think – is in Mommy. At one
enough.
In the end, I think these four
elements (and combinations
thereof) are what makes a
Dolan movie. The popular
quality of these stories and
characters, together with
music associated with specific
effects create climaxes and
memorable scenes. But can’t
we describe pretty much any
movie with this? Probably,
but it is the way Dolan uses
them that makes his movies
stand out: he magnifies and
exaggerates them, and it is
this accumulation of effects,
and his gimmicky use of
them, that is truly the essence
of his movies. His favourite
combination of effects is
slow motion and music, with
sometimes the picture being
blurred: this combination is
literally always present in
his movies. I think it is this
accumulation people do not
like: too cliché, too easy, too
gratuitous. In fact, too con-
structed and yet, too simple
to be real. Artificial
emotions.
Is that really what
it is? While I felt this
way the first time I
watched one of his
movies, Mommy, I
slowly came to realise
it is in fact the oppo-
site. Dolan is young
and has many things
to say, so much that he
must say them before it is
too late. And this accumula-
tion of effects is, I think, the
way he chooses to do this:
he saturates the picture with
effects in order to saturate it
with emotions; with his repet-
itive use of slow motion, he
literally slows down the time;
there is always this urgency
to say the most in the least
amount of time, to move us,
to make us remember. To do
so, he uses popular themes to
touch as many people as pos-
sible, to make us as close as
possible to what is happening
on the screen. He says it him-
self: all his characters “have
the same identity problems.
They’re looking for them-
selves, for a place in society.
They’re misfits trying to fit in.
They often love someone who
doesn’t love them back.”
Some people think Dolan is
trying too hard at this, with
everything so thoroughly
constructed to move us that
the result is we do not wish
to be moved anymore. But
what if we chose to let him
move us? And to me, this is
what popular art is about: to
reference Dolan’s favourite
movie, Titanic, what would it
be without Céline Dion’s (in)
famous song ‘My Heart Will
Go On’? Would it have the
same fame? Probably not,
and I this is what makes it
beautiful. This is what Dolan
is trying to achieve with his
extremely popular art, and I
think he succeeds. The truth is,
Xavier Dolan’s movies are to
cinema what pop is to music.
And that is amazing.
point in the movie, the charac-
ters suddenly feel a fresh air
of hope, contrasting from the
heavy atmosphere they (and
we) felt before. To signify this,
Dolan slowly opens the screen
ratio
from the oppressing 1:1 we
had since the beginning to a
wider 1.85:1, bringing some
welcome relief. But that is not
all: the widening is signified
within the movie by Steve, the
protagonist, opening wide his
arms in front of the camera
as a sign of freedom, the
ratio of the movie following
Steve’s hands as they move
(or, rather, Steve effectively
opening the ratio with his
hands). On top of that, all
this happens in slow-motion
with Wonderwall playing.
As I said, too much is never
