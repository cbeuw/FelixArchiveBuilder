What is so bad
about fossil
fuel companies,
anyway?
Rhidian Thomas and Max Moynan
discuss the things that the oil companies
don't want us to know
D
ivest Imperial
are calling
on College
to remove its
i n v e s t m e n t s
from fossil fuel
companies, but what exactly
is so bad about fossil fuel
companies, anyway? Most
attentionisgiventotheirimpact
on the climate through their
carbon emissions, but fossil
fuel companies often make
headlines (or conspicuously
don’t) for altogether more
sinister reasons. Many have a
track record of human rights
abuses and environmental
lapses that would embarrass
even the most hardened
dictator.
Take, for example, Royal
Dutch Shell (better known
simply as Shell). For many
years, Shell has conducted
drilling operations in the
Niger River delta region in
Nigeria. Since around 15BC,
the Ogoni people have lived
and worked on this land;
the arrival of Shell in the
1950s, however, turned the
old order upside down. Their
predominantly agricultural
lifestyle became ever harder
to maintain in the face of
oil spills totalling millions of
barrels (or approximately
40% of all of Shell’s oil spills
between 1976 and 1991).
Understandably, residents
began to question why Shell
were being allowed to conduct
operations in the area. After
all, 85% of Nigeria’s oil
wealth has benefited the top
1% of the population, with
70% of the country living
on less than a dollar a day.
\\ The company
focusses soley
on itself and
profits ahead of
environmental or
criminal issues \\
The money, just like the oil,
was flowing straight out of
Nigeria. In response to the
Ogoni peoples’ protests, Shell
were ruthless, hiring members
of the Nigerian military as a
private defence force. Raids
on villages in the area saw
residents tortured, raped, and
executed in brutal fashion,
in an effort to discourage
resistance to Shell’s expansion.
All the while, Shell continued
to employ the military, and as
recently as 2010 was found
to have paid an armed militia
$159,000 to protect its oil
infrastructure.
Unfortunately, Shell’s
record is far from unusual in
the sector. ExxonMobil, until
recently under the leadership
of US Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson, offers another
depressingly similar example.
The parallels are uncanny;
substitute Ogoniland in
Nigeria for Aceh in Indonesia,
and the story is pretty much
unchanged. Members of the
Indonesian military acting on
behalf of Mobil (pre-merger)
are alleged to have committed
abuses of nightmarish sadism:
shooting protesters in their
kneecaps, administering
electric shocks to their genitals,
and even threatening them
with pits of human heads.
As if that weren’t enough,
ExxonMobil’s story has
another dark chapter. Recent
investigations have revealed
that Exxon scientists were
among the first to realise
the implications of rising
carbon dioxide levels, with
some reports suggesting that
their research indicated a
warming planet as early as
the 1950s. To their credit,
the scientists insisted on the
publication of their findings
and Exxon acquiesced; by
the mid-80s however, with
the oil price falling, Exxon’s
management performed a
breathtaking U-turn. Over the
next decades, Exxon became
one of the most prolific
funders of climate-sceptics,
in a desperate attempt to
undermine the research of their
own scientists. Had it not been
for their intellectual dishonesty
and anti-scientific cowardice,
who knows how much closer
we’d be to addressing climate
change.
Imperial also has investments
in a company which employs
over 100,000 people, has
revenue of around $50
billion each year and is worth
more than McDonalds. It
has consistently kept a low
profile, due to it not owning
any oilfields, excluding it from
the Guardians divestment
list, from the ‘Keep it in the
ground’ campaign. Yet this
company works with every
major oil company to extract
the oil from the ground. The
company is Schlumberger and
is far from a moral one.
In 2015 it was found that
Schlumberger had employed
staff working in the US and
other US citizens to work on
contracts in Sudan and Iran,
something not allowed by US
law. To prevent authorities
uncovering this, the countries
were referred to as “Southern
Egypt” (Sudan) and the
“Northern Gulf” (Iran). This
was eventually uncovered
and the company were dealt
a $233 million criminal fine,
the largest in US history for
sanctions violations. The
company had been dealt a
light blow in comparison to
the size of the company, and
on receipt of the fine its shares
rose 2%.
Schlumberger still
operates today in some of
the most challenging areas
such as Burma, Libya and
Turkmenistan. Simultaneously
being self-aware of the issues,
a recent company memo
claimed that corruption in
Turkmenistan is not as bad as
in Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan –
not exactly reassuring. Clearly
the company focusses solely
on itself and profits ahead
of environmental or criminal
issues.
Alternatively, one may
look at our own President’s
appointment to the board
of directors of Chevron. The
company is the second largest
oilcompanyinAmericabehind
ExxonMobil, and in recent
years has been involved in a
bitter environmental dispute
in Ecuador, at one point
lobbying the US government
to impose trade restrictions on
the country so that the lawsuit
would be dropped. The case
began in 1993 and continues
to this day, overshadowing
other controversies including
an oil spill in 2011 off the
coast of Brazil in which over
400,000 litres were spilt, and
an oil rig explosion in 2012
in which two workers were
killed.
Hypocritically, the company
then launched a ‘Real Issues’
campaign designed to aid
discussion of the important
issues in the energy industry.
They did this through a ‘Will
you join us?’ forum – a clear
attempt at greenwashing,
as their CEO recently stated
that he doesn’t agree with
the policies intended to be
implemented by the Paris
Climate Accord. Presumably
the company wants to retain a
high level of output of oil and
gas into the future as the world
attempts to turn to renewables.
Collectively, shares in
Shell, ExxonMobil and
Schlumberger comprise
nearly half of Imperial’s
total fossil fuel investments,
while Imperial’s chummy
relationship with Chevron is
embodied in our very own
President. All parties seem to
be able to agree on one thing:
they’d much rather we didn’t
look too closely at their murky
past.
