SEX
My friend, a fresher, got pregnant
I’d never had to think about my views on reproductive rights before
T
his is a story about
a friend (yes, it is
actually about a
friend). Just like
any good story, it
starts with a nice
(by British standards anyway)
spring day with my best
friend telling me that she’s
pregnant.
“So what?” you ask.
“People get pregnant all the
time!” While that may be
true, she is not a 30 year-old
married woman. She’s not
even in a stable relationship.
In fact she is just like me, a
fresher. I don’t know about
you but I just didn’t see it
coming, despite her having
been in a happy relationship
with her boyfriend for quite a
while.
How can you fall so hard
for someone that safety goes
out the window? How does
a smart girl get talked into
not using condoms? How can
anyone even be with a prick
who “doesn’t like condoms”?
And then when the shit even-
tually hits the fan, how can
someone be so unprepared to
deal with the aftermath?
I don’t have the answer
to these questions. Heck, I
hadn’t even considered them
in the first place, which is why
I was probably even more
surprised at finding out than
she was. Or maybe because
she had already had a day
or two to process all that
information – yes, she did tell
her boyfriend before she told
me. And yes, if you’re won-
dering, the fucking bastard
immediately ran away. He
eventually reappeared, but a
bit too late to be of any help.
Alas, I digress. Back to my
friend.
She is a bit broken, but with
a sense of fatalism she’s come
to accept it. No, she didn’t
keep it – that was never really
a choice for her. That’s not to
say it was an easy decision
to make. The stress alone that
came with keeping it from
her parents, or from anyone
for that matter, having to find
a clinic to get the abortion
before going back home, and
even dealing with exams was
crippling.
It’s shit and I do feel bad
for her, really. But at the
same time I’m upset with her
because I still can’t fathom
how she could’ve have been
so naive. I hate badmouthing
my friends, but the only thing
I know about heterosexual
relationships is that pulling
out never works. If I know
that, how can someone who
actually sleeps with men not
apply this in their life?
Throughout this ordeal, I’ve
had no right to express any-
thing but empathy for her and
I’ve tried to be on her side
and help her in any way I
can. Yet, I’ve had such mixed
feelings about the knock-up.
I’ve never been in danger of
getting pregnant myself, so
I’ve never thought too much
about my feelings on abortion
and contraception, but this
single event has made me
think more than I thought I
was capable of.
And this is the point when
this becomes about me. I
know that I shouldn’t make it
all about my feelings when
she obviously felt so much
more – and was certainly
more entitled to do so – but
fuck it, we need to talk about
this. This three-week-long
drama made me think a lot
more about my opinions on
reproductive rights. Although
I knew that this was an issue
that people experienced, I’ve
always seen both sides of
the argument for and against
abortion, without ever form-
ing an opinion because I’ve
simply never had to.
Through my friend’s
unwanted pregnancy I made
unexpected discoveries about
myself. Now, when I feel the
urge to blame people for their
mistakes, I know it’s really
just pointless. Who knows
how many times they had sex
with or without a condom; it
doesn’t really matter either
way. It could have been
an isolated incident or it
could have been a regular
occurrence. The end result
ultimately is the same.
Mistakes happen, but we
should be responsible for
doing all that we can to pre-
vent them.
I don’t think she’ll com-
promise her safety again.
Probably. Hopefully. And
no one should (you know
who you are). Seriously,
consider me a slightly less
creepy version of the weird
PE teacher who’s tasked with
doing sex ed. It’s your busi-
ness if you want a child and
you are capable of raising it
alongside your studies, or if
you want to drop uni to be
a parent, but still play safe.
There are more dramatic
things besides an unwanted
pregnancy. Did you know
that you can lose your nose
because of syphilis? Google
it, and you will stack condoms
in your house forever.

I
haven’t had an abortion.
In fact, I only know two
people who have and
they personally told me
of it. One was a girl I
went to school with, who
had an abortion aged 15,

had never realised they were

People miss days, get sick,
or break condoms. Accidents
happen and people get preg-
nant, and maybe they don’t
want to raise a child right
now, thank you. Nonetheless
these women exist. But where
are they?
We don’t know who they
proportional to what we
have to lose – accidents will
happen. Whether it’s a slip
up, or pressure from a horny
boy who wants to get his
rocks off bareback, there
are people walking around
campus under the shadow of
an unexpected pregnancy.
It shouldn’t be a big deal.
95% of women who have
abortions in Britain don’t
regret them. They’re mostly
non-events: early abortions
are barely any different from
taking the morning-after pill,
beyond the inconvenience
of having to make doctor’s
appointments. Without touch-
ing on moral dilemmas,an
unwanted pregnancy is a
problem that needs dealing
with. Even in a country where
abortion has been legal for
over fifty years, it’s not consid-
ered proper to talk about it.
People want you to brush it
away and hush it up, to deal
with it quietly to avoid the
sting of breaking the taboo.
Or, because even if they are
pro-choice, they are judging
you for getting yourself into
this situation.
We all take risks when it
comes to having sex, whether
it’s the risk of getting an STI or
getting pregnant. Why can’t
we think of an unexpected
pregnancy the same as
getting chlamydia (which is
also unfairly stigmatised, but
less so)? You can deal with it
by taking a few pills, so why
is it any different, even for
Why do we stigmatise abortion?

those who don’t see a moral
problem with terminating a
pregnancy? Is it traumatic
because there is inherent
moral questioning, or is it
traumatic because the stigma
that surrounds abortion is so
powerful that you’re almost
forced to keep it a secret,
disabling your support net-
work and inducing feelings of
shame.
I don’t know. My only expe-
rience with abortion amongst
my peers, in what I thought
was a very reasonable and
sensible situation, resulted in
a lot of gossip, broken friend-
ships, and hurt feelings. I’ve
never come into contact with
any positive experiences of
abortion, never met anyone
who needed to terminate a
pregnancy and did what they
had to do with no negative
consequences or regrets, and
this is wildly unacceptable
when it’s a thing that around
a third of women will go
through in their lifetime.
It doesn’t have to be this
way. We don’t have to make
abortions these huge secrets
that we don’t talk about.
It’s frustrating and it makes
me angry that the only
time that abortion comes
up in conversation is in a
sex-negative context that puts
\\ One in three

women down. Women who
unexpectedly get pregnant
are not any less deserving of
respect, they are not stupid,
they are not murderers and
they are not evil. They are just
women, like you and I, who
happen to have undergone a
standard medical procedure.
The decisions that we make
concerning our bodies and
reproduction should be only
ours to make, and no one
else’s to judge.
At a time when the right to
have full agency over our
reproduction is not some-
thing that women can take
for granted; when in Ireland,
abortion is still illegal, and in
the United States access to
abortion and even contracep-
tion has been fought against,
silence is unacceptable. Only
if we talk about it can we
maybe address educating
people – teaching girls to be
assertive about their right to
safe sex while teaching every-
one to respect their partners
and be considerate of the
subtleties of consent.
The more we talk about
abortion and stop sweeping
it under the rug, the more we
normalise it as something that
is ultimately a normal part of
life. And yeah, maybe we can
stop being a dick to people
who are brave enough to
admit they’ve had an abor-
tion. That might be nice.
\\ Is it a traumatic
because there is
inherent moral
questioning in an
abortion, or is it
because the stigma
that surrounds
abortion is so
powerful? \\
\\ It makes me
angry that the only

is in a sex-negative
context that puts

The other is my mother,
who speaks about it with
the same straightforward
frankness with which she
talks about close family
deaths: as something sad that
mights have been traumatic
or difficult at the time, but
ultimately is normal and a
standard part of life.
You see, one in three
women in the UK will have
an abortion over the course
of their lifetime. That’s a lot
of women. Even if you take
the pill religiously, it’s still
only 99.9% effective, which
means that on average, one
woman in every thousand
taking the pill perfectly will
become pregnant over the
course of the year. But let’s be
real. No one uses any method
are because abortion is such
a stigmatised issue that no
one talks about, often not
even to their closest friends.
Yes, even at Imperial – where
we’re all smart and already
making huge sacrifices for
our education and we’re
going to take precautions
