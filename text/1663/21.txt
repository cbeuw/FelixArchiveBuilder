Forever
Restless
by
Brutality
Will
Prevail
Harms Way and their older
influences like Bolt Thrower.
The guitar weaves for 30
seconds before being joined
by a sludgy second guitar, a
P
lagued by member
changes and after
releasing a couple of
pretty disappointing
albums at the end
of 2014, Brutality
Will Prevail’s stock had taken
their disappointing album
Scatter The Ashes I was pretty
cautious to ensure that I didn’t
get my hopes up too much
when listening to their new
album In Dark Places.
My caution was completely
unnecessary as BWP have
really pulled it out of the bag
with this sludge influenced
hardcore album. Gone are
the distracting clean vocals of
Suspension of Consciousness
and big riffs are in. The album
has some great moments and
even a Cure influenced closer
but all this pales in compari-
son to their first single of this
album Forever Restless.
Opening with a lone clean
soloing guitar playing a
catchy haunting melody over
light, Forever Restless imme-
diately draws comparisons
to new-school bands like
By Rob Garside
of self-indulgence the kick-
ass riff re-emerges with the
vocals reverting back from
questioning, to declaring in a
commanding sneer that will
get bodies moving live. The
song gifts us another verse
and bridge in the same fash-
ion, with the vocals continuing
to bounce along with the
fun, flighty main riff. A key
detail of the second verse is
that a single line of the lead
vocalist’s lyrics is answered by
furious gang-vocals adding
a dangerous live feel to the
accomplished song. The intro-
duction of gang vocals is like
going to surround sound after
using a regular speaker set,
it’s immersive and visceral.

Hardcore’s leading lights in
the early 2000’s they built
up a following alongside

distorted bass and a cymbal
heavy drums part, layering
the reverb-heavy intro riff
on top. The intro shows real
restraint, rather than throwing
an aggressive riff in from
the start. BWP build tension
with a slow grinding but
also catchy opener. The solo
line descends into squealing
feedback and an aggressive
drum roll.
The cloud of tension splits
with an effortless tempo
change led by a brilliant,
crunchy, and so, so catchy
riff. Using a beautifully over-
driven Marshall sound, the
stop-start riff is soon joined
by the throaty vocals joining
the rhythm of the lead guitar.

Briefly the tempo slows and
the guitars switch to block
chords to bring the vocals to
centre stage. Here the vocal-
ist, Louis Gauthier, shows his
true flexibility changing the
inflection of the lyrics to make
them sound huge. While the
verses are accusatory, in your
face, with Gauthier’s finger
pointing at you and his spittle
spraying your face, the cho-
ruses are directed to the sky
as if the Gauthier is shouting
at god above.

We then move to a slower
sludgy dirty breakdown riff
with occasional melodic
reprieves to keep it clever and
exciting. This song deserves
to end in a breakdown with
the work done in tempo and
thematic changes through-
out building tension and the
aggression throughout the
song.
The song then suddenly cuts
out. That’s your lot. There
are so many good songs on
this new album with various
mixes of slow sludgy riffing,
accusatory lyrics and faster
old school riffs, but Forever
Restless is the king of them all.
