Palestinian Ambassador gives talk
In response to the Israeli Ambassador’s visit
Matt Johnston
I
mperial College was
host last week to
Manuel Hassassian, the
Palestinian Authority’s
diplomatic representative
to the UK, following
reactions to a talk with the
Israeli ambassador Mark
Regev back in January (Dr.
Hassassian does not have the
rank of ambassador as the UK
does not presently recognize
Palestine as a sovereign state).
The talk was well attended by
members of the student body
and provoked discussion on
both sides of the conflict.
The talk was hosted by Dr
Matthew Wraith, who was
pleased that his call to action
at the end of the event with
the Israeli ambassador for
the other side of the debate
to be showcased had been
answered. Unlike the Israeli
ambassador’s talk which
was shrouded in secrecy,
Hassassian’s visit was
advertised well in advance.
The format of the event was
essentially the same to Regev’s
visit, with Hassassian giving a
half hour opening talk before
initiating a discussion and
taking questions from the floor.
In his opening monologue,
Hassassian spoke about the
currentstateoftheconflict,how
he felt that there was currently
“no light at the end of the
tunnel”, and how negotiations
were essentially non existent.
His talk covered everything
from the involvement of the
United Nations in the peace
process and the resolutions
that they have passed, to
criticisms of the United States’
handling of their role as the
“broker of peace”.
Hassassian also touched
on President Trump’s meeting
earlier last week with
Palestinian Authority President
Mahmoud Abbas, referring to
it as merely “lip service”, and
questioned if Trump even knew
“the difference between a two-
state and one-state solution”.
He further accused Trump’s
delegation of being biased
against Palestine and called
them partisan (referring to the
US Special Representative for
International Negotiations,
Jason Greenblatt, and Trump’s
son-in-law, Jared Kushner).
The ambassador
also chastised Trump’s
inflammatory comments
in which he reduced the
complexity of the situation.
Last week the US President
referred to the Israel/Palestine
conflict as “something that
I think is, frankly, maybe not
as difficult as people have
thought over the years”.
Hassassian pointed out that
the situation wasn’t quite like
“buying real estate in Las
Vegas”.
Trump didn’t take home the
award of Hassassian’s “Most
Failed President in US History”
though, that honour was
awarded to Barack Obama,
who the ambassador felt had
accomplished next to nothing
in the conflict.
Despite criticisms,
Hassassian seemed to be
a firm believer that peace
negotiations via international
bodies (UN, US Government
etc.) were the only way
forward and that “Palestinians
cannot liberate Palestine by
firearms”. This faith in external
mediation was contrasted
by his frustration towards
international bodies which he
feels have done very little to
end the conflict. “[Palestine
and Israel today are] stuck
between the historically
inevitable and the politically
impossible,” Hassassian said,
and later added his doubts
about the prospect of a two-
state solution.
Following Hassassian’s
opening speech, the questions
section produced heated and
emotional discussion from
the audience and Hassassian
alike, and the topics of
the Palestinian Authority
Martyrs Fund, the UN, and
the effectiveness of the
PLO (Palestinian Liberation
Organisation) were discussed
amongst other things.
The event was realised thanks
to efforts by Farri Gaba, an
aeronautics undergraduate,
who was pleased to see
students from a range of
backgrounds participating
in the conversation. “I took
inspiration from the previous
Israeli ambassador’s talk
about the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict to invite his direct
counterparttodiscussthesame
conflict from the opposing
view” says Gaba. “I did this
to offer interested students a
breadth of perspective and
understanding.”
Dr Wraith, the chair of both
events, was similarly pleased
with outcome of the talk:
“This time there was a very
good turnout of critical voices
from the audience which I
welcomed. I contacted the
Israeli Society and the Jewish
society beforehand, just as
I contacted the Palestinian
society last time, saying ‘come
along, get involved, confront
him with what you think
and what you know’. They
responded and got involved.”
Wraith is confident that
these talks are a testament
to a change in the culture of
political apathy Imperial has
been known for: ”I don’t think
scientists have the option of
being apolitical now, if they
ever did. And judging by the
rateatwhichthiseventsoldout,
I don’t think anyone wants to
be”. This event takes place just
weeks after 10,000 scientists
and allies participated in the
London ‘March for Science’.
Trump’s recent attack on
climate change and science
in general, as well as the
potential fallout that Brexit
might cause to research
funding, have highlighted the
relevance of politics to the
scientific community. “Already
I’ve got yet more emails from
students, just like Farri last
time” added Wraith, ”saying
‘why don’t we do another
event on India-Pakistan in
Kashmir? Why don’t we get
other ambassadors along?’
There are plans underway.
Watch this space.”
Gaba himself has plans to
make this a regular occurrence
on campus: “I hope to keep this
momentum in student interest
and appetite going into next
year, with similar high profile
guests. I hope to extend the
scope of the topics discussed
to different areas of global
politics and economics...
Europe, America and the
Asia-Pacific. I will hopefully
be doing this from within a
club soon to be established as
‘The Speakers Club’”. Watch
this space indeed.

Imperial Divestment Campaign resurrected
Or is this the final nail in its coffin?

people for, say clean energy
rather than oil and gas,” says
Cook.
In fact divesting from fossil
fuels while continuing to
funnel so much talent into the
industry would be hollow at
best if not outright hypocrisy.
But soon it might be the only
option if we want to remain
cutting edge and market
our employability. In Europe
coal is rapidly being phased
out, with companies such as
Drax Group Plc, Steag GmbH
to Uniper SE closing and
converting generators all over
the continent. In the US too,
solar alone currently employs
more people than coal, oil
and gas combined, despite
Trump’s apparent love for the
black stuff.
How long will it make sense
for Imperial to keep pushing its
students into a field that might
not exist for much longer?
“We recognise that fossil
fuels contribute to greenhouse
gas emissions and we work
to mitigate their impact while
seeking viable alternative
sources of energy,” said an
Imperial spokesperson in
response to the campaign.
“We steward our endowment
gifts carefully and believe
that we can have the greatest
impact on climate change by
optimising these resources
to invest in research and
education.”
Probably indefinitely.
T
he divestment
campaigners at
Imperial are on
the move again.
This week saw
them taking to
campus with various events
and actions. On Wednesday
students dropped a banner
off the main union building in
Beit Quad. The banner which
wrote out in large black and
orange letters “IMPERIAL
DIVEST NOW!” was taken
down within hours. The Union
has come out in support of
student-led campaigns but
it remains unclear whether
Union Staff were involved in
the taking down of the banner
On Thursday, a chalk mural
sprang up on the paved floor
in front of Queen’s Tower.
Again, security acted fast
and put a halt to the protest,
but not before the realisation
of a large four by two metre
wide drawing. In response,
security personnel tried taking
down participants’ College ID
numbers. When asked what
the problem was one member
of security said it had nothing
to do with the content but
rather the fact that someone
would have to be called in to
wash the mural away.
Ironically, in 2014 Imperial
asked students to create a
massive chalk mural along
Imperial College Road for
Imperial Festival. Content or
removal didn’t seem to be a
major concern at the time. In
fact, the mural fell victim to
the unpredictably wet summer
weather and was washed
away halfway through the
festival.
Campaigners think Imperial’s
investments don’t reflect its
aims as an institution, namely
the use of science to solve
global challenges. “The fossil
fuel industry’s continued
exploration is incompatible
with our future and undermines
the research done here on
low carbon technologies and
climate change,” says Naomi
Pratt, one of the campaigners.
Though both actions were
quickly suppressed and it’s
unclear how many students
noticed them, those who
did felt divestment was an
important issue to discuss. “I’m
fairly on board with it”, said
Laurence Copson, a Climate
Change, Management
and Finance student who
happened to be at the Union
with his cohort during the
banner drop. “I’d just do it from
a financial perspective. I’d just
make an economic argument
for why you’d choose energy
efficiency and alternative
energy over oil and gas”.
For the first time in 2015,
green energy accounted
for more than half of new
electricity capacity with the
IEA predicting a 42% growth
of renewable energy capacity
by 2021. Then, last year,
green energy development
overtook the fossil fuel sector.
In the US alone 22GW worth
of green energy capacity
or an equivalent of eleven
large hydroelectric dams
were added to the energy
infrastructure.
So does that mean Imperial’s
money-making instincts might
lead it to divest from Big Oil?
James Kennedy, another
Climate Change student,
doesn’t seem convinced.
“When you think about
Imperial and how much money
the chemical engineering
department for example must
take from big oil companies
and how that provides huge
funds for research at our
university, this is probably
going to be difficult.”
“It’s going to be the last nut
to crack in term of universities.
It’s got to be the most oil-and-
gas-focused university in the
country” says Charlie Cook,
another member of the cohort.
Would divesting even matter
though? According to a 2016
Freedom of Information
request Imperial has £220
million in its endowment fund.
Thisincludessharesinoilgiants
such as Exxon (£0.52 million),
Cairn Energy (£0.1 million),
Shell (£0.86 million) and
Statoil (£1.05 million) as well
as companies which provide
technological services to Big
Oil such as Emerson (£0.63
million), Mitsubishi (£0.88
million), Petrofac (£0.75
million) and Schlumberger
(£0.92 million). These funds
are insignificant in comparison
to the human capital Imperial
annually invests in the oil and
gas industry.
Every year Imperial sends
over 800 students into oil
and gas or mining. But what
if it didn’t? “That would be a
far greater statement – if they
were going to say OK we’re
going to change the focus of
the majority of our courses so
