T
here’s a common
misconception
that Eurovision
began solely as
a way to reunite
the bruised and
battered Europe after
the Second World War.
This may be the reason
that it was so successful,
and to this day is the
largest entertainment
show on Earth, but the
true sentiment behind its
conception is rather more
geeky.
The first Eurovision Song
Contest took place in
1956 at the suggestion of
Sergio Pugliese from an
Italian television station,
who wanted to take the
Italian Sanremo Music Fes-
tival and expand it to test
the limits of live broadcast
television. The first contest
was in Switzerland, with
seven countries taking
part, and the challenge
was to have seven differ-
ent television networks in
seven countries simulta-
neously broadcasting
the same program. Of
course, the European
Broadcasting Union used
the excuse of bringing a
war-torn Europe together
as an excuse for their
experiment.
To compete, a national
television network must
be an active member of
the European Broadcast-
ing Union, located in the
range of broadcast of the
EBU, or being a member
state of the Council of
Europe, and jump through
several hoops such as ensur-
ing that it will be broadcast
to 98% of their country, they
broadcast the previous year’s
show, and of course, that they
paid the fee. The television
stations each have different
ways of determining their
entry, although by now most
countries host X-Factor style
shows to decide their contest-
ant (probably as a way of
wringing more money out of
viewers in votes).
The numbers of participat-
ing countries grew gradually
each year. After the Second
World War, a contest that
unified Europe and had
themes of love and peace
was popular and it became
wildly successful. Following
the Soviet dissolution and the
end of the Cold War in 1991,
there was a sharp increase in
the number of participating
countries to 43 countries par-
ticipating in 2008 and 2011,
and similar numbers taking
part in the subsequent years.
The only European countries
that have never participated
in Eurovision are Liech-
tenstein, Vatican City and
Kosovo, although all countries
but Germany have failed to
participate at least once since
1956, for reasons ranging
between a form of political
protest to simply not being
able to afford it. The winning
nation must be able to host
the contest the following year,
on top of their participation
fees, the possibility of which
has ruled out entries by many
nations at different points in
time.
To celebrate the sixtieth
anniversary of Eurovision,
Australia were invited to
take part in Eurovision 2015
as a one-off, as a nod to
the popularity of the Song
Contest down under. They
were given an automatic spot
in the final and came fifth
overall, with Guy Sebastian’s
Tonight Again, a clear nod to
Europop with in composition
and staging. Australia were
so popular that it was decided
that they would be allowed to
return in the subsequent year,
but would not be given an
automatic place in the final. In
2016, Dani Im’s The Sound Of
Silence propelled them into
second place, and Europe’s
love for their Oceanic cousins
does not seem to be waning.
Even if Australia were to
win the Eurovision Song
Contest, it wouldn’t be hosted
outside Europe. One special
condition of Australia’s par-
ticipation is that they agree to
co-host the contest in Europe
if they are to win – if they win
this year, they will probably
co-host with Germany for
2018. The novelty of Australia
still seems to be strong even
among the most traditional
Eurovision fans, and Austral-
ia’s don’t seem to be on trend
to be any less successful this
year.
2017 was set to be the first
year to reach 44 participants,
but with Russia having pulled
out of this year’s competi-
tion as their performer was
not granted permission to
travel to Ukraine for the
competitions, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina being forced to
withdraw due to the financial
state of their national televi-
sion station, only 42 countries
were eligible to hold a place
A potted guide to Eurovision history
\\ Eurovision
is about way
more than the
music, it’s about
using your
vote to express
friendship
and political
approval (or
disapproval) \\
I once had the misfortune of watching Eurovision with only an Argentinian, a Mexican, and a
Lebanese for company. If you’re not European (or Australian, apparently), Eurovision seems to
be very confusing and completely un-understandable. For us Europeans, either on the mainland
or stuck on little islands, it’s the defining feature that we all have in common. How is it possible to
not feel affectionately towards the brutal political performing, voting and shunning, the drunken

in the final.
Of these, all but the Big
Five (France, Germany,
Italy, Spain, and the
United Kingdom, who are
the biggest financial con-
tributors to the European
Broadcasting Union, and
thus are automatically
given a place in the final)
and the host nation had to
battle it out for a place in
the final at the two semi-fi-
nals/elaborate excuses for
a tech rehearsal that took
place on Tuesday and
Thursday.
The winners are decided
by votes from all the
other countries, with one
to twelve points being
awarded. With this in
mind, it pays to be good
friends with your neigh-
bours. Eurovision is about
way more than the music,
it’s about using your vote
to express friendship and
political approval (or
disapproval). Scandinavia
and the Balkan bloc are
very good at awarding
their douze points to their
own, but the UK doesn’t
tend to do so well. Ireland
and Malta are usually
our friends, but thanks to
our sometimes question-
able political decisions
and tenuous relationship
with Europe, our scores
suffer. Two months after
the invasion of Iraq, the
UK was awarded a grand
total of null points across
the whole competition, a
feat that occurs only very
rarely.

United Kingdom’s chances
This year, with Brexit looming,
many European countries are
anything but our best friends.
Even Theresa May has been
reported as joking that she
doesn’t think that we will get
many points this year. It seems
that as well as ruining our
country, she wants to ruin our
chances at Eurovision too. But
you never know, we’re fairly
obviously in dire straights with
a snap election being called,
so maybe we’ll get some pity
points and do slightly better
than usually. We can’t really
do any worse.
Russia
Let’s address the huge ele-
phant in the room in this year’s
Eurovision: Russia’s absence
from the contest held in Kiev,
Ukraine. The Russian entry,
Yulia Samoylova, was banned
from entering Ukraine after
touring Crimea in 2015. Each
participant is organised by the
respective television stations
in each country, and Russia’s
channel One turned down
suggestions that they have
her perform remotely, or
God forbid, that they pick
another representative
that would be granted
entry to Ukraine. Instead,
they chose to withdraw
from the contest entirely,
saying that she will
instead represent Russia
in next year’s competi-
tion. Instead, on the day
of one of the semi-finals,
she performed in Crimea
in an act of defiance.
The winning 2016 entry
from Ukraine’s Jamala
about the deportation
of the Crimean Tatars
by the Soviet Union was
undoubtedly fantastic, but
we can’t deny that the fact
it won the Eurovision Song
Contest was anything
but a political statement.
Indeed, Russia took it per-
sonally, and threatened to
boycott the next year’s contest
in protest. With all of Europe
choosing this entry as the win-
ners, I can’t imagine they felt
very welcome.
Eurovision tends to be a
contest of openness, shown
no better than when drag
queen Conchita Wurst rose
like a phoenix to win the 2014
competition. Russia’s anti-gay
stance tends to bring protests
from crowds at the Eurovision

finals, who feel like this kind
of discrimination goes against
the spirit of Eurovision. This
year Russia has had a huge
media storm regarding its anti-
gay laws, with reports coming
in the last month of gay men
being detained and executed
systematically in Chechnya.
Maybe, in the spirit of Euro-
vision, they really are better
sitting this one out.
Language
In the early days of Eurovi-
sion, songs were required to
be performed in their national
language. Since 1999, there
has been no restriction on the
language that songs can be
performed in, which has lead to
large numbers of songs being
sung in English or French, which
tends to increase the score due
to their lyrics being understood
by a larger number of viewers.
However, Eurovision purists,
and some countries, still prefer
performances in their national
language. But the numbers
are dropping off, with the
general trend being all coun-
tries moving towards English
performances – even France
who have faced protests in the
past when their entrant has
sung in any other language.
Only Portugal, Hungary, and
Belarus have entries that are
not at least partially in English.
France
But why are France singing in
English? Well, it’s actually not
entirely out of choice. France
nearly faced disqualification
this year when it emerged
that their song Requiem was
performed as far back as
December 2015, long before
it was submitted as their Euro-
vision entry. This breaks the
rules, but France have got
around it by using a bilingual
version of the same song with
an English chorus. This differ-
ence is enough to keep them
safe, although is it worth the
cost to their gallic pride?
