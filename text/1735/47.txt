The lesson here kids; get
a good haircut. Following
this kerfuffle, the destroy-
er of worlds had smelt
the girls on the side-line.

Canterbury managed to
keep hold of the ball for

blood and decided to keep
the trend going. Living up
to his name, he straight
up signed a bloke’s death
warrant. He killed a man
(okay he only knocked
him unconscious, I’m
using hyperbole, I learnt
about it at English GCSE,
got to keep the readers
enticed.)
After this, the boys in
blue began to play with
almost illegal flair. With
a few subs rolling on
the integrity of the team
didn’t waver. Bosh after
chop after filthy offload
later and we had another
line-out in front of their
line. I’ll give you one
guess as to what happened
next. Damn right, Tube +
Line = Smashed.
Now that you are suf-
ficiently lubricated from
all of our previous antics,
I shall let you climax with
the piece de resistance that
was IC’s final try. Now up
to this point Faf had been
having an exceptional
game. Crisp delivery,
fantastic defence, just all
round MotM calibre. But
that wasn’t enough for
him, he wanted more.
Let’s paint the scene…
Canterbury in possession
on the halfway, IC with
solid defence; a two-hit
tackle from Fresher
Fraser and French Frog
De Bezieux gives George
‘no knees’ Beckman
the perfect opportunity
to rip the ball. It spills
out the side of the ruck.
Mass confusion for all
those who aren’t Faf. He
snatches the ball, looks
up at what seemingly is
a sea of rancid red shirts
with very little in the way
of opportunity. But no. He
kicks the ball. *what is he
thinking*. The crowd are
stunned into silence as he
puts on his running shoes
and hares after it. Surely,
he won’t beat the fullback
and winger to the ball I
hear you exclaim!? But
oh boy oh boy does he!
With an inch perfect kick
meaning he can dive onto
the ball as it crosses the
line Imperial Men’s score
one last time! Ending the
game in emphatic fashion
with a score line of (my
dad’s estate2 – (my dad’s
estate + curlcream) to
zero) or 39 – 0 to you

W
hat a
wonderful
experience
today was,
Saturday 16th November
2019. Coming back from
the national’s competition
, the feeling that is in my
heart is happiness! Before
I even begin to describe
my first synchronised
swimming competition
with Imperial College
London, I would like to
thank a few people that
made it happen. Firstly,
Juliette, Greta and Marine
members of the society
that put their hearts in it
and we all had the chance
to try it out and secondly
the volunteers on the
day for giving up their
Saturday to be with us.
So, my first syn-
chronised swimming
competition with Imperial
was insane! Something
that I will never forget
with people that made it
extraordinary. It is said

that what matters the
most is not the destina-
tion but the journey you
did to get there. Well, it
is completely true. We
didn’t get the chance to
win a medal (this time
:D), but the hours spent in
the pool practising and the
land trainings to count the
choreography made our
journey to the national’s
amazing. I only joined at
the beginning of the year,
but we spent so much time
together, from laughing at
our first try and debating
to find out the right count
of the choreography. On
the day of the competition
“On the
day of the
competition
the team
spirit and
empowerment
of each other
were so
strong.”
the team spirit and em-
powerment of each other
were so strong. I loved
every moment of this
experience and seeing the
breath-taking performanc-
es of the winning teams,
duets and solos was very
inspiring!
