Felix Should be a Space for Rational Debate
Jun Liu argues that Felix should be a space for non-emotional discussions that focus on facts,
not feelings

A

usually help us
explore new
k n o w l e d g e
but quarrels often stop us
from learning. The recent
comments by Mr. Titmuss
and Mr Liu on Felix have
drawn my attention to the
different opinions towards
China. It is apparent that
both of the authors only
intended to have a dis-
cussion; however, the last
response by Mr. Titmuss
was seriously inappro-
priate. Parts of Titmuss’s
comment are not included
as the “proper operation of
Freedom of Speech in the
UK” and some arguments
which he made are lack of
supports.
Some language in
Titmuss’s response should
not be rightfully used;
on the other hand, such
expressions in public
might have broken the
laws of UK. The Freedom
of Speech only operates
under the premises where
the “reputation and rights
of others” are protected.
As Mr. Titmuss has
admitted to “deliberately
insult China” in his
second last paragraph,
the “Human Rights Act
1998” is not on his side.
Moreover, it is doubtful if
Mr. Titmuss is guilty of an
offence to use “insulting
words” under section
F3.4A of Public Order
Act 1986. Some may say
that it is an exaggeration
and Mr. Titmuss’s use of
language only intends to
make his point; however,
when “China” becomes
the accusative after
“insult”, it is an abuse to
many Chinese nationals.
Commenting and criticis-
ing constructively on the
government of a nation
helps it to improve yet it
is unacceptable to insult
an entire country. In this
particular case, it is even
more intolerable when
inadequate examples are
used in Mr. Titmuss’s
commentary.
Before raising objec-
tions towards the Chinese
government’s actions,
it is necessary that the
entirety of what had
happened which is not
included in Mr. Titmuss’s
writing. During the recent
protesting in Hong Kong,
it is worth to note that it
started out to be a peaceful
protest but the protestors’
behaviours resemble
terrorism to some extent
as the conflict becomes
more and more violent.
Alongside with the delays
at the airport and fires set
at subway stations, the
riot is causing civilian
casualties. On Friday
(Nov.15) morning, the
Food and Environmental
Hygiene Department of
Hong Kong confirmed
the death of a 70-year-old
worker who got hit by
the protestors at Sheung
Shui Station. A bit earlier
in September, a visitor
from mainland China
was beaten to severe
injury at the airport only
because he did not agree
with the protestors. Such
incidents are so prevalent
in Hong Kong that they
can be easily found via a
reputable and “oft-cited”
venue, The Guardian. The
protestors are currently
using “violence and
intimidation, especially
against civilians, in the
pursuit of political aims”
which is exactly the defi-
nition of terrorism in the
Oxford Dictionary. The
instability in Hong Kong
has caused casualties in
not only civilians but
many more polices. For
instance, thirteen officers
were injured early in July
when protesters threw un-
identified liquids at them
in a clash (CNN); a group
of protestors beat a plain-
clothes policeman then
threw a Molotov cocktail
that briefly set the man
on fire (The Guardian).
Under section 89 of the
Police Act 1996, “it is a
criminal offence to assault
a constable in the execu-
tion of his duty” in the
UK; such laws are similar-
ly present in almost every
nation on this planet. Not
all the protestors are to be
considered as terrorists
who attack civilians and
polices, especially those
who pursue political aims
through peaceful means;
however, it is also vital
to notice that many of the
protesters in Hong Kong
are not in favour of peace.
With these facts in mind,
it is easy to understand
why the police in Hong
Kong have been arresting
the protestors and the
government of China has
prohibited any support to
protesters online. If not,
consider how countries
in the west dealt with
terrorists and criminals
who committed assaults
on police officers. When
their “pursuit of freedom”
results in the murder
of innocent people and
severe damages to the
city, is it still “glorious” or
even justified? When we,
as spectators, irresponsi-
bly shout out “Glory to
Hong Kong”, is it fair to
those Hong Kong citizens
who actually suffer from
this social unrest?
Publications in a
newspaper must consider
facts but not subjective
impressions. Hong Kong
is merely one of the
examples. For instance,
achieving political aims
is only part of the reasons
for creating the Great
Firewall; some external
online platforms indirect-
ly brought about terrorist
activities in China and
many websites contain
not politics-related but
still illegal materials.
In Mr Titmuss’s logic
of connecting the Great
Firewall to highly oppres-
sive censorship, it is likely
that many western nations
also have such censor-
ships, especially after
the “PRISM” incident.
Also, before calling the
1989 Tian’anmen Square
event a “massacre”, it is
probably better to know
the true history behind
the news. Based on
stories from some of my
family friends who are
the actual witnesses of
that event, I would not
call it a “massacre”. My
three years of high school
experience in Canada
have provided me with
many different perspec-
tives other than that of a
Chinese national; I have
seen many kinds of ar-
guments and discussions
regarding Chinese politics
and economy. All that I
could see from Mr Tit-
muss’s response, though,
is disrespect and provo-
cation. What I expected
from Felix was the spirit
of seeking the truth and
the spread of constructive
opinions.
In the future, it is im-
portant that writings on
the college newspaper are
respectful and rational. Mr
Titmuss owes the readers
of Felix an apology due
to his inappropriate use
of language and mis-
leading dictions but it
is still up to Mr Titmuss
if such an apology will
be made. Felix provides
Imperial students with
an excellent platform of
informing the rest of the
college of their opinions
and it is delightful that
people from various back-
grounds could have their
perspectives to collide;
however, it is also worth
to be mindful so that this
platform is not polluted by
emotions or insults.
Come sir, let us have a rational debate like gentlemen // Wikipedia
