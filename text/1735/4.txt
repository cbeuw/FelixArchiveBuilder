A
survey con-
ducted by
Dig-In – of
freshers’ week
welcome package fame
– has demonstrated
that a strong majority
of students in the UK
oppose Brexit. Out of
over 35000 students sur-
veyed, 38% stated that
they ‘hated’ that the UK
is leaving the EU, while
a further 24% ‘dislike’
it – totalling for a 62%
disapproval rating.
The statistics do not
vary significantly between
UK and international
students, though there is
a notable split based on
gender – 58% of men,
66% of women, and
77% of those who iden-
tify otherwise responded
with ‘hate’ or ‘dislike’,
showing a significant
stasticial variance.
By contrast, only 9%
responded that they ‘liked’
or ‘loved’ the UK’s pro-
posed departure. A further
28%ofstudentsresponded
that they feel ‘indifferent’
– a statistic described by
Felix’s Ameena Hassan
as “expected if it were an
Imperial-based study, but
shocking considering it
was nationwide”.
The apathetic cohort
mayinsteadreflectadesire
for politicians to focus on
other topics. When asked
about the topics they felt
should be the top priority,
53% said climate change,
21% were for healthcare,
and only 17% for Brexit.
Students appear to feel
the urgency of globalised,
existential issues more
heavily than more short-
term and localised ones,
perhaps encompassing an
ideology best described
by one Imperial student
speaking to Felix: “we
are in a globalised world;
we are meant to unite, not
separate each other.”
Felix interviewed
students on the South
Kensington campus,
and received a variety of
responses approximately
in line with the survey’s
findings. Most Imperial
students felt strongly that
Brexit will be negative
for the country, with the
next highest cohort being
those who said they did
not know anything about
Brexit.
One student comment-
ed that Brexit had directly
affected their decision
to stay in or leave the
country: “I don’t think I
am going to stay after my
studies. It’s sad but I have
no idea what is going to
happen.” They confirmed
that they would definitely
have stayed if Brexit was
not occurring.
This lack of certainty,
and a resulting dearth of
optimism, is shared na-
tionwide. Only 7% of stu-
dents responded that they
‘love’ or ‘like’ the thought
of the UK’s near-future –
a 20% drop since last year
– while over half (53%)
either ‘hate’ or ‘dislike’ it.
On the matter of trust,
the statistics are even
more damning – particu-
larly towards British poli-
ticians. 84% distrust Boris
Johnson and 76% distrust
Jeremy Corbyn. Almost
three-quarters of students
were convinced that the
UK would not leave the
EU on October 31st – a
prediction that turned out
to be accurate.
An interviewed Impe-
rial student commented:
“Labour was against it,
and now suddenly they
are for it. Everyone’s poli-
cies seem to change every
day. It’s confusing for the
people, because we don’t
know who to trust.”
The CEO of Dig-In,
Chris Platt, added: “These
findings are hard to hear -
our student community is
clearly concerned about
its future. Much has been
said in the past about
the split of leavers vs
remainers being heavily
weighted by age, but this
large scale poll shows just
how opposed to Brexit
these young people - the
potential future leaders
of this country - feel. My
hope is that their thoughts,
feelings and future
outcomes are carefully
considered by whichever
government is in power in
their near future.”
However, there seems
to be little faith that any
government, regardless
of the general election
results, would be able to
deliver on their promises.
Another student said “a
new parliament will have
to renegotiate – that will
be another couple of years
of delay. I don’t think it
will happen in the next
five years.”
Despite the verbosity of
many students’ comments
above, Comment Editor
and reporter Charlie
Titmuss noted a distinct
reticence amongst stu-
dents about the topic of
Brexit. “A lot of people
were initially happy to
talk to us, but as soon as
we mentioned Brexit they
backed off and were kind
of scared to speak. It’s still
a controversial topic even
three years later.”
Survey Shows What Students Really Think of Brexit
The survey conducted across over 35,000 students showed that a significant majority oppose Brexit and deeply
distrust British politicians; student interviews conducted at Imperial corroborated
“62% of
students
nationally
'hate' or
'dislike' Brexit”
