need some continuity in
terms of direction and ex-
perience. But I don’t want
to conflate this with our
Union’s broader issues
around staff retention.
It’s not the same as losing
someone who was here
for a shorter time. And
the reasons behind him
leaving are very different
to why most other staff
leave.
Felix: In terms of
people leaving, the
Union has also just
seen the resigna-
tion of one of their
most senior student
volunteers in Thom-
as Cross, the CGCU
President. What are
your thoughts about
his departure?
AS: Tom is a very
outspoken person, and
can be highly critical
of the Union – but has
also been one of our
most committed student
volunteers. That he’s felt
the need to resign at this
point is not good news
for any of us – for the
Union, or for the CGCU.
My understanding is that
this has come about as a
result of tensions within
his committee, which
he can talk about better
than me, and the high
workload on his course.
We all do tough degrees,
and the Constituent Union
President roles are among
the most time-consuming
of the volunteer positions.
It’s understandable that
he would want to put it
to one side if he feels his
work is slipping. For our
part, we want to ensure
the CGCU is supported
going forward so they can
deliver their best effort to
the students of the Faculty
of Engineering, and also
that any volunteer who
has experienced diffi-
culties feels comfortable
approaching us.
Felix: Student rep-
Abhijay Sood, the Union President // ICU
resentation has come
under other scrutiny
recently after the
recent Union Council.
How come 60 of 61
Union policies were
allowed to lapse?
The Union was left
with a single active
policy. How can this
have been allowed to
happen? Did this not
result in the Union
taking action without
proper democratic
input, via policies
established by Union
Council?
AS: I wouldn’t say
that – there is democratic
accountability built into,
for example, the OTs’
manifestos. While that ‘60
of 61’ figure was true in
terms of official policies
on the website, there have
of course been meetings
with elected representa-
tives in the last several
yearsduringwhichstances
on various matters were
established. The lapse in
policy specifically could
be due to administrative
issues, staff turnover, a
lack of urgency on behalf
of previous student rep-
resentatives, whatever
it may be – but there are
still things we have agreed
within the last three years
since some of those
policies lapsed.
Felix: So if 60 of 61
policies can lapse
and it makes no dif-
ference, do they mat-
ter? What’s the point
of them, are they at
all important?
AS: First of all, I think
the policies were ignored,
and that was because there
were too many of them,
and still are. Anything
the Union Council voted
on was put into policy –
such as a specific action
to be taken by the Union
President or Felix Editor –
even if they only applied
over a short time frame.
Felix: How are you
doing? Things heat-
ing up a bit, getting a
bit stressful?
AS: In terms of the
stress – Unions have peaks
and troughs. Welcome
is a peak, then it calmed
down a bit, and now it has
heated up a lot. With the
upcoming departure of the
Managing Director – the
most senior staff member
in the Union – things are
going to be difficult.
For reference, the
Managing Director (cur-
rently Jarlath) is the most
senior member of perma-
nent staff in the Union.
Felix: How does the
departure of some-
one in that senior
role impact you and
your job?
AS: There’s a personal
impact whenever
someone is leaving. Each
of the Officer Trustees
(OTs) work closely with
different members of
senior staff. Jarlath is the
one I work with most
closely personally – we
share an office in the
Union building. He’s been
a soundboard for me, for
example, to test ideas, and
we’ve worked on various
projects together. So in an
official capacity there’s
also a direct impact there.
Felix: Jarlath is one
of the most experi-
enced staff members
in the Union and the
second most experi-
enced member of the
Senior Management
Group. What do you
think the impact of
losing his experience
will be?
AS: A big reason we
need full time staff in the
Union is that students
aren’t here all that long
– OTs are only here for
a year, for example. You
