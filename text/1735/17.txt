Crisis? What Crisis?: How to Save a Minority
Government or Die Trying
T
he government
has no work-
ing majority,
millions are pro-
testing on the street and
economic catastrophe
seems imminent. Sound
familiar? Well, the year is
1979: in the midst of mass
industrial action and the
coldest winter in two dec-
ades, the Labour Party’s
grip on power hangs in the
balance, and it’s up to you
to save it.
No, literally. This is
an immersive production
- every decision made
during the course of the
night is up to you and your
fellow theatregoers, so it’s
best to get your armchair
politician out. The instant
you get into the control
room (a condensed
Whitehall, replete with
70s decor and serviced
by a fax machine) a Party
membership card is thrust
into your hands, a few
light pleasantries ex-
changed, and you’re given
150 minutes to stop the
government from falling.
And what a state it’s
in: tonight’s the night of a
vote of no confidence; the
lorry drivers are on strike,
with nearly every sector
of the industrial economy
looking to follow suit;
martial law is hours
from being declared; and
nobody’s even bothered to
clean away the cigarette
stubs and apple cores
covering the table. If you
think this all seems too
much to solve in a single
night, you’re completely
right - and that’s what
makes Crisis? What
Crisis? such unabashed
fun. Once HQ’s been
tidied, it’s entertainment
as a spinning plates act:
in a single flourish, you
can start a trade war with
the United States, join
the Soviet Bloc, or get
Junta’d by the British
Military as you reel from
one crisis to another.
This is a pre-Thatcherite
world of trade unions,
and correspondingly
much of the night is spent
appeasing one sector of
the economy only to stir
another into open revolt -
the experience of getting
roundly hammered by a
dead-red union leader at
the negotiating table (a
more humbling turn-of-
events than I can possibly
express) alone justifies the
ticket price.
So it turns out gov-
erning is hard, and for
all our idle speculation
it’s easy to forget that
good intentions do not
necessarily produce good
outcomes. As enjoyable
as Crisis? What Crisis? is,
it might also be the best
bit of civic education I’ve
ever received, even if that
comes with the depressing
realisation that govern-
mental ineptitude might
be the norm rather than
the exception - though we
did actually end up saving
the government, whatever
that counts for (of course,
without spoiling anything,
there are far more
entertaining outcomes
possible). Perhaps the
only drawback of the pro-
duction is that its striking
verisimilitude rewards a
passable knowledge of the
era, so it might be worth
reading up the Winter of
Discontent on Wikipedia
before you go. Still, that’s
not the worst pre-show
requirement in the world:
you know what they say
about not learning from
history.
#WeAreArrested - the brutal reality
#
WeAreArrested
poses some very
important ques-
tions. What is the
power of the press? How
do we protect its freedom
when its own government
acts outside its legal
jurisdiction? This is a
deeply personal account
of a globally relevant
story. In such strange
times where lies and truth
are indistinguishable,
#WeAreArrested reminds
us of the importance of in-
tegrity, and the mightiness
of the pen.
Almost immediately we
are thrust into a make-be-
lieve meeting room, with
three editors debating
whether to publish their most
impactful story: footage of
weapons linked to their own
government being smuggled
into a neighbouring nation in
a brutal war. What follows
is the tale of a corrupt gov-
ernment overstepping its
legally designated power.
It’s surprising how much this
true story plays out like a
crime thriller.
In November 2015,
editor-in-chief Can Dündar
and bureau chief Erdem Gül
for Turkish newspaper Cum-
huriyet were detained prior
to their trial for allegedly
“divulging state secrets”,
referencing a story published
earlier in the year. For 92
days, Dündar remained
in solitary confinement,
oppressed by what he called
to be a “lack of colour”. “We
Are Arrested”, his memoir
of this time, is evidence
that a free mind cannot be
imprisoned, that thought and
self-expression endure.
This idea is a recurring
theme throughout the
production. There is a truly
enchanting scene in which
the protagonist is imagining
all his favourite delicacies
at brunch; a bitter coffee,
warm pastries and Buck’s
Fizz. This is followed by him
dreaming of dancing with
his wife one more time, a
rebellious, careless, intimate
dance. He finds every op-
portunity to find pleasure in
the smallest things: a cheese
toastie cooked between the
grills of the radiator, and
the blissful few seconds of
sunlight against his face each
day.
The whole ensemble
comes together thanks to
Peter Hamilton Dyer (as Can
Dündar), who is completely
enthralling. The dialogue
bounces between speaking
directly to the audience
and other characters, which
limits the other performers
from reaching their potential,
but does not detract from an
otherwise wholly captivating
production.
Despite being heavily
drawn from a true story; no
specific names or locations
are given. It is clearly a
conscious decision to omit
these details to let it become
a parable. It is a common
frame of mind to think that
hush deals and censorship
are issues other nations face,
especially when sitting in
the Arcola Theatre, a couple
thousand miles from Turkey.
Nevertheless #WeAreArrest-
ed is a welcome reminder
that power can corrupt.
