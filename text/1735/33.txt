revealed earlier in August,
is expected to run on all
Huawei devices, from
their TVs, smart speakers,

Thus, this common
operating system closely

Huawei’s CEO, Richard
Yu, “We’re entering a
day and age where people
expect a holistic intelli-

all devices and scenarios.
To support this, we felt
it was important to have
an operating system with
improved cross-platform

to be rolled out in China
towards the end of this

2020.

state security only makes
it more suspicious as to
whether the company
actually accumulates in-
telligence for the Chinese
government.
With this suspicion as
a basis, the move towards
cutting ties with Huawei
has been brewing for the
pastfewyears.InFebruary
2018, FBI director Chris
Ray warned against
buying Huawei as well as
ZTE smartphones. A few
months later, the Pentagon
banned the sale of those
phones at US military
bases, and towards the end
of the year, Huawei’s CFO
was arrested in Canada
and charged with bank
fraud. Further, telecom
providers in Australia
stated that they wouldn’t
be using any of Huawei’s
telecom equipment in
their 5G rollout plans and
Britain’s BT stated that
they would effectively
remove all Huawei based
equipment from their
current 4G setup by 2021.
These events did not play
well with the company’s
image as whole.
During the past week,
the Trump Administration
granted Huawei a 90-day
extension from the ban.
This comes as a breather
for the forty or so small
Huawei’s platform. To do
this, Huawei announced a
1billiondollarprogramme
to encourage developers
from around the world to
create and support apps
and games for its “Ap-
pGallery”. As consumers,
we know how critical an
app marketplace is to the
smartphone experience.
Thus, the company hopes
that this programme
would help motivate
developers to consider
its app distribution mar-
ketplace as important
as those of Google and
Apple. Though, giving
out money as an incentive
to developers isn’t enough
to fix the company’s
image as a whole. In all
fairness, this new software
ecosystem would lack the
middle man that is Google
in ensuring a moderate
level of security. Thus,
it’s up to the consumer to
trust the company in its
new, distinct path towards
approaching the tech
market.
“An app
marketpace is
critical to the
smartphone
experience”
Furthermore, Huawei
reported that the blacklist-
ing could potentially lead
to the layoff of its 800+
US employees. However,
a week ago the company
reportedly gave staff over
286 million dollars in
bonuses to stick through
the ban.
Speaking of the ban,
having anticipated it,
Huawei has been working
on an alternative operat-
ing system for the past
few years. Known as Har-
monyOS, or HongMen-
Shortly following the
ban, Huawei was placed
on the US department of
commerce’s entity list,
which basically blacklists
US-based businesses from
