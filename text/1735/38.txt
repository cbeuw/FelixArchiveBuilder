The ‘Earthling’ Ed Winters: Chuka Nwobodo Argues
for Veganism
O
n October 29th

The Speakers’
Society hosted
‘Earthling’ Ed
Winters as he weighed
the pros and cons of a
vegan lifestyle and tried
to persuade an audience
to think more deeply as to
whether we can morally
exploit animals for food,
medicine, and so on.
The statistics concern-
ing animal agriculture
are startling. A third of
all the available land
on Earth is cleared to
make way for billions of
livestock waiting to be
slaughtered. Over 100
species are lost each day,
and we are eliminating
species 1000 times faster
than is natural, according
to Christine Dell’Amore
of National Geographic.
Many people seem to
think that transportation
is the most significant
contributor to green-
house emissions. They
are mistaken! Animal
agriculture beats them all,
according to the Food and
Agriculture Organisation
and the United Nations.
Moreover, up to a third of
all usable water on Earth
is reserved for livestock.
Ironically, a convention
between the Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment,
the IUCN Red List, and
the Global Environmental
and Biodiversity Outlook
demonstrated that up to
90% of freshwater pollu-
tion is caused by animal
agriculture.
Even still, perhaps you
think this doesn’t really
affect you. Maybe you
purchase meat that is
supposedly ‘ethical and
sustainable’.
“My meat is organic,
grass-fed, and raised by
British farmers,” you
might say. First and
foremost,Edchallengesus
to consider what actually
is organic. Often, farmers
bend the rules to optimise
their sales. This means
that they can still pack
chickens into small barns
by the thousands and be
labelled as free-range or
organic. Additionally, you
may argue that grass-fed
cows are more ‘humanely’
exploited than corn-fed
since grass is closer to
their natural diet than
corn. Ed informs us they
will still eventually be
injected with major doses
of antibiotics until they
are economically viable
– which, I believe, is not
humane. As Ed asks: is
there any relevance in
making livestock’s lives
‘freer’ if we are just going
to forcibly take their lives
from them in the end
anyway? I don’t think
anyone could relate to that
kind of ‘freedom’. Finally,
while ‘homegrown’ live-
stock may taste better to us
and be better for the envi-
ronment, when the result
is an increase in demand
for local produce, does it
really make a difference?
We need to recognise that
‘organic’, ‘grass-fed’, and
‘homegrown’ may well be
marketing terms vying to
mislead us and to make
us feel comfortable with
seriously injuring our
environment.
By now, you may argue
that while using animals
instead of more sustain-
able alternatives for food
may be unjust, what about
when they help to save
lives? They have helped
humanity enormously,
after all. Just look at the
trend in life expectancy
over the years! Animal
research has contributed
to over 70% of Nobel
Prizes in Physiology and
Medicine.
I believe medicine is
based on old-fashioned
techniques. We still
perform live demonstra-
tions of dissecting frogs
to explain the function of
the liver, when YouTube
videos would, in most
cases, suffice. This is just
one example of where a
pedagogical shift should
be made to minimise
suffering.
Who is to say that the
same could not be done
for clinical trials? Clearly,
the fixation on clinical
testing needs to be chal-
lenged. Is there any way
to map the responses an
organism will have to a
drug without the need to
sacrifice lives to do so?
I don’t know of anyone
who knows the answer to
this. The existing methods
are effective, despite their
ethicaldubiousness,andso
few people bother to seek
alternatives. Ed claims
that a vegan lifestyle can
change the mindset. I can
only imagine what could
happen - what advance-
ments could be made in
this area - if the medical
community became
vegan.
Where do you, the
reader, stand in all of
this? A vegan lifestyle
is both environmentally
sustainable and naturally
medicinal. In other
words, if we all became
vegan, Ed argues that
there would be enough
resources available to
solve world hunger, and
we could save millions of
endangered species and
their habitats. Plus, we
would never even contract
many of the diseases we
would normally treat with
animal-tested drugs.
Support the revolution.
Support veganism!
