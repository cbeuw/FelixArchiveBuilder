“The Razr
Phone reflects
the good
old days of
uniquness and
innovation”
Audi E-Tron Sport-
back
A
t the LA motor
show, Audi
unveiled its
second electric
vehicle, the Audi E-Tron
Sportback. Powered by a
dual motor setup and with
a range of of up to 446
kilometres, this car uses
the same base drivetrain
and battery as its older
brother, the E-Tron SUV,
which was unveiled last
year. The car is expected
to be priced at an expen-
sive 71350 Euros for the
base spec and would be
available in the European
market by early 2020.
Google Stadia
Google’s online game
streaming service, Stadia,
was released earlier this
week, and the initial reac-
tions seem to be slightly
negative, primarily due
to high expectations
generated by Google’s
marketing. Users and
reviews have even gone
to say that it’s a “beta that
you pay real money for”
the months to come.
Mustang Mach-E
Ford unveiled their
Mustang Mach-E, an
all electric SUV that
promises performance
and practicality. It’s a
brave move from Ford
to attribute an electric
vehicle to the Mustang
name, which is generally
associated with pure
American muscle. The
car partially draws inspi-
ration from Tesla Model
3’s minimal interior and
starts at a base price of
around 42000 US dollars
for a range of about 370
kilometres. The baseline
model is scheduled to be
delivered by late 2020,
while the more powerful
GT model is set for 2021.
With Elon Musk congrat-
ulating Ford for taking
the effort to go electric,
it’s only time before
other popular automakers
decide to shift as well.
Apple 16”MacBook
Pro
Earlier last week, the
MacBook Pro lineup
received a facelift with a
new 16” model replacing
the old 15”. So far, this
new upgrade seems to
have been very well
received in the tech
community, with some
saying that the product is
“reasonably well priced
for the specifications”
and that “Apple finally
listened!” Apart from the
larger 16” screen, the new
MacBook Pro saw a rede-
signed thermal solution
and audio system as well
as a shift back to the old-
style scissor mechanism
keyboard. In addition,
the escape key made a
welcome return and the
performance jump due to
the upgraded processor,
RAM, and graphics
card proved significant.
Overall, it looks like the
MacBook Pro may be
back in the game! For
those of you waiting for a
refresh to the 13” line, it’s
rumoured to happen early
next year.
Microsoft Project
xCloud
Microsoft’s game
streaming service, Project
xCloud, is currently
under preview, and earlier
this week, the company
announced an additional
fifty titles that would be
available at launch, some
of which include Forza
Horizon 4, Tekken 7, and
Devil May Cry 5. The
service is set to release
sometime next year, so
it provides considerable
time for developers and
testers to optimise the
platform for the promised
launch lineup of games.
Even while in its preview
stage, xCloud has more
games than Google’s
Stadia, and Microsoft is
planning to integrate this
service in some way into
its already existing Game
Pass subscription for a
low monthly price. Only
time will tell how these
two evolve and compete
with each other.
Motorola Razr Re-
boot
Motorola finally
announces the much
rumoured modern imple-
mentation of the classic
foldable Razr phone.
The phone truly brings
back the good old days
when smartphone design
saw the light of unique-
ness and innovation. In
addition, it still maintains
the incredibly satisfy-
ing flick and snap of a
classic flip phone. With
a promise to be durable
and practical, this phone
just might see a positive
outlook in the modern
smartphone market and
may even motivate other
smartphone producers to
tackle the challenge that is
folding phones.
“MacBook
Pro lineup
received a
facelift with
a new 16”
model”
and that “you don’t get the
promised performance.”
With a launch lineup of
only 22 games and terrible
latency, we can only hope
that this product fulfills its
initial, advertised goals in
