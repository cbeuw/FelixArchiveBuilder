Why British Food Doesn't Suck
t’s a story as old
as time, it feels.
Along with other
stereotypes like
our bad teeth (not
scientifically true), exces-
sive politeness (have you
been to Scotland?), and
biting understated sarcasm
(definitely accurate), the
prejudice against British
food is widespread and
endemic. It’s frequently
tossed in my face during
my occasional indulgenc-
es in internet flame wars
on one of my favourite
Facebook groups – a
gem called “Italians Mad
at Food – The Group”,
which I thoroughly advise
following.
Well, this week I
dearly want to disabuse
you of this notion. Food
is, thankfully, one of the
few areas in which one
can have national pride
these days without being
construed as a madman.
Us Brits don’t really do
patriotism, anymore –
we’re far too obsessed
with self-deprecatingly
ripping on ourselves in
an orgy of masochistic
self-loathing, like the
proper stiff upper-lipped
gents and ladies we are
– but goddamn do I feel
just fine standing up and
saying that Eton Mess is
effing delicious.
I think the conception
largely stems from the
perhaps blander palettes
of the war generation – a
group of men and women
so stoic in the face of the
German war machine that
they even sacrificed their
tastebuds. Yes, a gener-
ation of people raised on
rations as children and
denied the simple pleas-
ures of salt and pepper
might occasionally under-
season their meat. We all
adjust to favour the fla-
vours we consume when
we are young. The payoff
is that they’ll all live until
they’re 109, while I will
go out in a blaze of failing
cardiovascular glory at
the tender age of 35. Wait,
I smoke as well – make
that 33.
For some reason, this
particular subset of British
cuisine – the undersea-
soned and overboiled
vegetables with a slab of
tough meat and potatoes
– has become conflated
with the concept of British
food itself. While, yes, it
does make up a decent
portion of our diets, it
doesn’t really make sense
to conflate it with modern
British food.
After all, modern
British food is pretty
great. We have the resur-
gence of old industries,
especially dairy – did you
know that Britain has one
of, if not the, broadest and
most diverse selections
of cheeses produced here
in the world? If I recall
correctly, it even outstrips
France. (No, I won’t fact
check that – this is an
Editorial written on a
Thursday evening. Take
me to prison for my gross
breaches of freedom of
speech.) Cheese is great.
I haven’t met many
people who can honestly
say they find meals
like Eton Mess, Beef
Wellington, a well-made
full English breakfast, or
steak pie to be conceptu-
ally gross or bland meals.
They’re the quintessential
British dishes, and yet
the cuisine they are from
is considered tainted by
this image of blandness. It
doesn’t make sense to me.
Of course, the most
exciting aspect of British
food by far is fusion food.
Personally, I see this as
much British cuisine as
meals eaten here for thou-
sands of years. I believe
that anybody born here
is British, and meals like
Chicken Tikka Masala –
now a national dish – that
were developed by British
people in Britain don’t
become not-British-food
because their parents
came from somewhere
else. That’s just my take.
And this is, without
question, the most
exciting place to be to
experience fusion food in
its wonderful variety. The
largescale immigration
we have into the British
Isles has led to a lot of
multicultural diversity.
I’ve been to a lot of cities
around the world, and in
very few – if any – could
you walk down a street
in the centre of town and
come across the same in-
credible range of cuisines
you get spread across
one block in London. We
treasure and value food
from everywhere, from
France to India to Korea
to Chile, and our most
exciting developments in
cuisine are coming from
this particularly marvel-
lous sector. It’s awesome
to watch in action.
It’s rare that I’d use
something as seemingly
trivial as food to justify
taking a serious political
stance, but truly – if
globalisation has led to
such amazing growth and
change in the world of
food, I take that as a fairly
convincing argument to
remain in the EU. More
convincing than anything
I’ve heard out of a politi-
cian’s gaping mouthhole
in quite some time,
anyway.
What’s particularly
awesome is that in the
UK, it isn’t spectacle. It
isn’t limited to top-end
restaurants or cheap
takeaways. This variety
of food is carried into our
homes. What we cook in
the average week contains
elements of cuisines and
ingredients from every
corner of the world. I’d
comfortably have ramen,
curry, and tacos on the
same day, all prepared
with my own hands in my
own kitchen.
The area in which
we fail, in the UK – and
perhaps where all the bad
conceptions come from –
is that we don’t seem to
carry our passion for food
into a passion for cooking.
I am, of course, referring
to the ready meals aisle.
We do not set aside time
in our days to cook and
prepare food. We do not
go home for lunch. We eat
a ludicrously overpriced
premade Tesco sandwich
at our desks, instead. We
buy ready meals on the
way home from work.
We’re tired so we bang
something in the oven, or
run down the local chippy.
It’s a shame, and a
shame I’m very guilty of
sharing. I cannot count
the number of blooming
Burger Kings I’ve eaten at
2 AM over the past couple
of months, during late
night shifts at the office.
Hell, I will probably end
up doing the same tonight.
This is, however, a
failure of Britain’s food
culture – not of British
food!
