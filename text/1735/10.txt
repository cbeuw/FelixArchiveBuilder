I
t was a great experi-
ence that my previous
article was published
on Felix without
any discrimination, so I
would like to express my
gratefulness to Felix at the
beginning of this second
response. In addition, I
will also apologise for
my emotional language
in the previous paragraph
if that negatively affected
any of you reading the
article. I hope it was not
an insult to anyone, and
as Mr. Titmuss “respect-
fully” pointed out in his
response, I was in over-
whelming rage.
Last week when I
was first replied by Mr.
Henry Alman who is the
Felix editor, I started to
understand how press in
the UK works. I appre-
ciate that it provides a
platform where students
can express their genuine
opinion. However, it is
quite different from press
in China as I feel there
is no censorship at all.
Therefore, I wrote down
some of my opinions from
a Chinese perspective
and sent to Mr. Alman in
one of the email, and the
contents were as follows:
1. Felix should take
some responsibility to
check whether the content
published is objective,
truthful, and respectful to
the communities involved
2. If someone wants
to use the British way to
judge other countries, not
only China, it is much
more appropriate to
consult that community if
that is acceptable
The request about an
apology made by Felix
was never mentioned
again as I respect that
Felix takes an absolutely
neutral and objective
position, and I would like
to thank Mr. Alman for
spending his time letting
me know about Felix’s
position. However, I insist
that Mr. Titmuss should
apologise for this.
This article aims to
respond to Mr. Titmuss’s
second article, which
responded to my first
article. As this starts to
become a debate, I would
like to first briefly summa-
rise some key points what
Mr. Titmuss argued in his
second article to help both
the audience and myself
to understand what is
going on.
1. My previous article
is an “insult to logic”
because I relied on
overwhelming personal
outrage
2. Mr. Titmuss made
“reasonable points” in his
second article
3. I cited “Youtube”
and that can be ignored as
it is not a reliable source
4. The Chinese gov-
ernment is oppressive as
it does following things:
- So-called “re-education
camps”-Suspectedselling
organs from executed
political prisoners - Great
Firewall on the internet
- Preventing people in
China exercising freedom
of speech - China attempts
to extend censorship to
other countries
5. I was acting on
behalf of the Chinese
government and aimed to
please Beijing
To the first point, it
is up to your audiences
to judge if I was logical
or not, but I believe that
rage does not necessarily
make someone irrational,
so let see what “reason-
able points” Mr. Titmuss
have. Oh wait, as this
is a response to my first
article, did he argue back?
I will list some of my
arguments below:
1. The exercise of
freedom of speech carries
6. Differences between
Chinese and Western
values must be recognised
7. Some recommenda-
tions to help readers learn
about China
It seems that Mr.
Titmuss only replied the
third and the seventh
point, so I will start my
arguments address these
two.
The so-called “re-ed-
ucation camps,” or
what ever you call it,
has nothing to do with
diminishing the position
of minorities in Xinjiang
province. Xinjiang
province is located near
Afghanistan, and has
long been influenced by
extremist Muslims and
terrorism. These facilities
aim to provide profes-
sional training to those
who have been influenced
by terrorism but haven’t
reached the level of
committing crimes so that
these people can go back
to the society, work, and
earn their lives. As there
is potential of terrorist
activities, safety insur-
ances in these facilities
are necessary. I watched
BBC’s report on these
facilities on Youtube, yes,
Youtube again, and many
things that the journalist
found astonishing are
actually quite common in
China such as uniforms,
10 people sharing a room
(actually some Chinese
universities still have fa-
cilities of similar level). If
this practice is inhumane,
well, probably we should
learn from the UK,
sending fighters to bomb
the terrorists when they
have activities, kill them
all and possibly some
civilians?
I don’t know how there
could be such a ridiculous

special duties and respon-
sibilities for the rights or
reputation of others and
the protection of national
security
2. I respect any rational
and peaceful attempts
made by Hong Kong
people for calling for
what they want, but what
is happening in Hong
Kong is neither rational
nor peaceful
3. China is not op-
pressive as pictured by
western media
4. Misunderstandings
of westerners about China
5. It would be wrong,
disrespectful and irrespon-
sible if someone wants to
judge China without truly
knowing about China
