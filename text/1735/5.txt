potential they have for mimicking real-life nervous systems

“The limiting
factor in
advancing
robotics to
reflect human
actions is not
mechanical,
but that of
data-sensing”
H
ave you ever
played with one
of those snap
w r i s t b a n d s
when you were younger?”
AndresArrieta asks. In the
Engineering lab at Purdue
University, Dr Arrieta and
his team have designed a
novel data sensor that uses
a similar snap-change;
from a curved shape that
is under tension, to a flat
structure which generates
an electronic signal when
triggered. The latest in the
field of biomimetic sen-
sors, this sensor has the
potential to function like
a real-life nervous system.
In their flat form, the
sensor’s two layers are
held apart. Then, when
an impact triggers a snap-
change by a clever trick of
engineering, the layers are
brought together, allowing
tiny flecks of nickel that
are spread throughout the
top layer to become close
enough to conduct an
electrical signal.Amagnet
in the bottom layer resets
the switch.
“The shape is encoding
the message,” says Dr
Arrieta. “It’s just like
having ones and zeros in
a binary system.” And
he’s right: the two shapes
translate into a binary
‘1’ and a ‘0’, allowing
the sensor to generate a
simple string of data. Bi-
omimetic developments
like these, taking inspi-
ration from nature, have
revolutionised fields that
rely on data-sensors such
as automotive technology
and robotics.
The advanced, yet
mildly terrifying Cheetah
robot at the MIT Biomi-
metics lab uses similarly
novel biomimetic sensors
in the Cheetah’s footpads.
The limiting factor in ad-
vancing robotics to reflect
human actions is not a
mechanical problem, but
one of data-sensing. Da-
ta-sensors need to capture
a complex amount of data,
process this in real-time,
and yet be made of lasting,
durable materials.
Biomimetic units like
these completely redesign
data-sensing. Current
digital models improve
sensitivity by upping the
data input, relying on a
sophisticated processing
unit to sift through the
volumes of information.
But nature has already
found a more efficient
answer; filtering at the
point of data sensing,
triggering a signal only
when past a set threshold.
This means Dr Arrieta’s
unit only snaps when it
should, and ignores the
background noise. Yet, Dr
Arrieta explains, this still
doesn’t explain the full
potential of the research.
Copying biology brings
more advantages than just
efficiency; Mother Nature
has also worked out how
to handle truly complex
data, including non-bina-
ry data.
Dr Arrieta uses the
example of a bird’s flight
to explain this; nerves
in the bird’s wings are
sensitive to the angle of
each feather and how
they move in the wind as
the bird flies. The extent
of change to this angle
determines the action
the bird takes; a subtle
‘wingtip’ adjustment for
a light breeze, or a bigger
movement needed for a
heavy gust. This unit, just
like a bird’s wing, also has
the ability to generate a
range of actions.
“Our signals can be
interpreted in ‘ones’ and
‘zeros’, so ‘on’ and ‘off’.
But also - and this is really
the power of it - every
time there is a snap, there
is a pulse of electricity.
Binary logic has only a
‘one’ and a ‘zero’, but our
[unit] works with pulses
of information. So, de-
pending on how fast, slow,
strong, or weak the sensor
is triggered, the pulse
pattern will be different,
and our unit interprets
these differences.”
These unique electrical
patternscanbemappedtoa
learning algorithm, which
translates these signals
into various actions. This
brings the potential of
the system closer to a
real-life nervous system –
completely different from
digital data-sensing.
So, it’s different - but is
it really that much better
than digital methods?
Daniel McKenna, a
robotics software engineer
at the artificial intelli-
gence start-up Emotech,
thinks that both digital
and biomimetic sensors
have their pros and cons.
He does, however, point
out that while develop-
ers have now designed
processors that can
handle huge amounts of
digitally generated data,
overcoming past limi-
tations, there is a recent
“drive to simplify things”.
“There’s a push to try
miniaturise things, move
them back onto devices
while avoiding battery
drain, rather than relying
on the cloud servers that
enable large amounts of
processing power. These
sensors would filter un-
necessary information and
lead to faster on-machine
processing.”.
Asked to explain if
Dr Arrieta’s excitement
over the potential to
read unique electrical
signals may be warranted,
McKenna points to his
own analogy. Referring to
data like this as non-lin-
ear, he describes water
in a bucket responding
to vibrations. The water
converts a time differenti-
ated input (the beat of the
vibrations) into a spatial
signal (the pattern of
ripples seen in the water),
at a much quicker speed
than an algorithm could.
Likewise, the electrical
pulse translates data at a
much quicker speed than a
digital sensor would. “The
processing that biomimet-
ic sensors offer gives that
element of non-linearity
a lot easier than a digital
system,” he notes.
But before starting a
wristband-wearing, me-
chanical cheetah-wielding
robotics revolution,
McKenna warns it will
need hours of testing
before it goes to market
due to the high-stake
safety implications. But
despite a long road ahead,
it’s come a long way from
a simple snap-band toy.
Don’t you think?
