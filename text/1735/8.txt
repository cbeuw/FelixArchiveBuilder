The Eritrean-Ethiopian Conflict And The Man Who
Solved It

proves an oppressive country

n today’s world,
where uncertainty
and instability seem
to always be on the
surge, it is often relieving
to witness the ability of
men to repair the damages
of their predecessors, to
heal the cuts left open
in the soul of an entire
people. It is even more
rewarding when such hap-
penings involve a place
like Africa, a continent
whose history has been
usually associated with
violence, from slavery to
forgotten genocides such
as those against the Tutsis
inRwandaandtheHereros
in Namibia. Although
rare, such tragedies still
happen, as the world was
reminded last month when
Ethiopian Prime Minister
Abiy Ahmed was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize for
his role in the reestablish-
ment and normalisation
of relationships between
Ethiopia and neighbour-
ing Eritrea. The dispute
between the two countries
was caused by the frontier
between them: a frontier
that sparked two years of
war, from 1998 to 2000,
which only came to a halt
due to a ceasefire being
reached, but without a
peace treaty. The conflict
was still officially ongo-
ing until last year. Entire
families living in proxim-
ity of the border as well
as a considerable distance
away from it, given the
deep bond between those
nations, were torn apart
for almost 20 years.
To understand the
issue better, it might
however be useful to
take a step back to the
end of the 19th Century.
In this period jingoism
ruled over Europe and
the world economy was
revolutionising itself on
the wave of the Second
Industrial Revolution:
thirst for new lands
was the result of such
conditions for most
western European coun-
tries. Among them was
a newly formed nation,
Italy, whose interests
befell Eritrea. The
country, with its coast
facing the Red Sea, was
located in a wonderful
position for trade given
the recent opening of
the Suez Canal. Conse-
quently, the maritime
company Rubattino
managed to buy some
land in the area, which
was later to be sold to
the Italian State. This
marked the beginning
of the Italian rule in
Africa; before the end of
the century two attempts
were carried out by the
Italians to expand into
the mainland by con-
quering neighbouring
Ethiopia. In both cases
a staunch resistance by
the Ethiopians, along
with a chronic disorgan-
isation of the Italians,
delayed their overthrow-
al. It was only in 1935
that the fascist regime
managed to conquer
the region as part of
the newly established
Italian East Africa, also
compromising of Eritrea
and Somalia. This dom-
ination lasted however
just until 1941, when
British troops occupied
the colony during World
War II. At the end of this,
while Ethiopia regained
its independence,
Somalia and Eritrea
passed under British
administration, as a
provisional measure. In
this context Ethiopian
emperor Haile Selassie
successfully pushed for
the transferring of the
latter under his country’s
sovereignty. However,
such happening sparked
an armed fight for inde-
pendence, which lasted
30 years from 1961 to
1991. Finally, in 1993
a referendum under the
supervision of the UN
took place and decided
almost unanimously for
Eritrea’s independence.
In 1998, as stated
above, war broke out
again due to old scars and
the dispute surrounding
to whom the bordering
town of Badme should
bold PM. Seeking peace
with Eritrea is not the
only risky move Ahmed
has undertaken in his
short mandate; among
other things he has freed
thousands of political
prisoners and foster
actions to decrease
gender disparity in
an authoritarian and
deeply traditional land.
He has also been the
target of some murder
attempts, including an
explosion at one of his
rallies. His approach
of drastic reform has
caused discomfort for
many, including the
countries own military.
Having said that,
Ethiopia remains an
oppressive country and
there is yet much to do
to ensure things change
consistently, especially
to ensure that next year
elections are carried out
in a fully democratic
way. The well-deserved
Nobel Prize Abiy
Ahmed won should not
therefore lead to his
political sanctification,
as happened premature-
ly (and as it has been
revealed, wrongly) to
many other Nobel lau-
reates. This shall instead
take place in a long time
to come, when it will
be known whether the
principle of freedom
will have imposed itself
or succumbed in its fight
with authoritarianism.

ceasefire established
a joint Eritrean and
Ethiopian commission
with the goal of solving
the border issue. This
ruled for Badme to be
assigned to Eritrea,
which Ethiopia refused
to comply with until
last year, when Prime
Minister Ahmed
promised to fully im-
plement the decision.
