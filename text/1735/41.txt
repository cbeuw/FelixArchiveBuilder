Researchers show noise pollution is threatening the
survival of a number of species
N
ew research
from Queen’s
U n i v e r s i t y
Belfast has
indicated that noise pollu-
tion is threatening to over
100 different species.
The researchers found
that noise affects the be-
haviour of a wide range of
species including amphib-
ians, birds, fish, mammals
and reptilians. Noise pol-
lution can affect species
by interfering with their
communication, which
is important for picking
a mate or warning for
predator; this disruption
may lead to lower survival
rates.
Furthermore, noise
pollution may disturb the
balance of ecosystems, by
changing the dynamics
between prey and pred-
ators. For example, bats
and owls rely on the
sounds of the potential
prey, and noise pollution
makes it more challenging
to hear and find their prey,
forcing them to invest
more time in sourcing
food, which could lead to
a decline in these species.
In the aquatic world,
fish larvae find their
home based on the sound
emittedbyreefs.Increased
noise pollution in the sea,
mainly as a result of ships,
makes it more difficult for
fish larvae to find suitable
reefs, leading many to
choose less suitable reefs,
which may reduce their
lifespan.
Noise pollution also
has a huge impact on
the natural migration of
animals. Many birds will
avoid noise polluted areas
during migration which in
turn affects where birds
choose to live. These
changes in distribution of
species can in turn affect
ecosystem health as each
species forms an integral
part in maintaining the
functioning of a specific
ecosystem.

ganisation has previously
said noise is one of the
most hazardous forms
of pollution for people,
but this new meta-study
found that it has huge
effects on the biology and
physiology of amphib-
ians, arthropods, birds,
fish, mammals, molluscs,
and reptiles. Indeed, all
organisms studied, ter-
restrial and aquatic, were
found to be affected, indi-
cating that noise pollution
affecting animals is the
norm, not the exception.
Previous studies have
suggested that certain
species are affected by
“Noise
pollution
must be
considered as
a serious form
of man-made
environmental
change and
pollution”
noise pollution, but this
meta-study is the first
of its kind to provide
quantitative evidence on
a widespread of species to
encourage institutions to
regulate noise pollution.
The study analysed the
effects of noise in over
one hundred species,
which were divided into
seven groups: amphib-
ians, arthropods, birds,
fish, mammals, molluscs
and reptiles.
Dr Hansjoerg Kunc,
from the School of Biolog-
ical Sciences at Queen’s
University Belfast and
lead author, concluded:
“This large-scale quan-
titative study provides
significant evidence that
noise pollution must be
considered as a serious
form of man-made en-
vironmental change and
pollution, illustrating how
it affects so many aquatic
and terrestrial species.
Noise must be considered
as a global pollutant and
we need to develop strat-
egies to protect animals
from noise for their liveli-
hoods.” The study has not
evaluated the
exact effects in terms of
beneficial and detrimen-
tal effects for different
species, but it seems
clear that noise pollution
can affect ecosystems in
complex ways. Indeed, to
combat noise pollution,
there should be further
research, and cooperation
with governments and
policy makers. A previous
case similar to the one of
noise pollution, was when
light pollution was found
to harm nocturnal wildlife,
and local councils in
UK started to implement
policies to combat this.
