Disability History Month
Get more out of your degree
UK Disability History Month is an annual event that creates a platform
to celebrate and focus on the history of people with disabilities. It runs
from 22nd November to 22nd December every year.
This year’s national theme is Leadership, Resistance and Culture. As
approximately 80% of all disabilities are hidden, Imperial is focusing on
the hidden disabilities of our community.The College and the Union will
be joining forces on our new campaign MoreThan Meets the Eye, and
we have put together a calendar of events including panel discussions,
comedy night, a film screening, and a lunch.
