I Will Still Be Whole (When You Rip Me in Half)/
Before I Was a Bear
Double-bill production: an emotional play depicting mother-daughter bonds followed by a one-woman dark
comedy production
I
Will Still Be Whole
(When You Rip Me
in Half) harnesses
you from the offset,
the two characters stand
facing outwards towards
the audience, hands by
their sides and speaking
with urgency. It describes
the events that take place
for a young woman, EJ
(Aoife Hinds), and her
estranged mother, Joy
(Tuyen Do), prior to and
during their first meeting
in 22 years. It navigates
their emotional struggle
as they face their fears
of inadequacy, loss of
direction and loneliness.
The artful stage manage-
ment encapsulates the
tone of the play perfectly,
the subtle interactions
between the characters
as they enact their sep-
arate stories manages to
show the enthralling and
emotional bond between
both Joy and EJ. Hinds
was particularly magnetic
in her role,skillfully de-
picting the EJ’s struggles
with abandonment and
loss of direction with
the necessary emotion, a
heartbreaking listlessness
and enough humour to
lighten the heavy subjects
at hand. Joy’s story was
perhaps the more complex
one, working through
feeling trapped and
incapable of providing
sufficient care and love
for her daughter.
The opening scene
strikes a stark contrast
between the two: EJ’s
anger and insecurity are
highlighted from her first
lines, as are Joy’s feelings
of fear, resentment and
sadness. The characters
don’t fully address each
other until the very end.
The majority of the
play is spent with them
dancing- figurative-
ly- around each other,
avoiding each other’s
gaze, but still tentatively
reaching for each other.
The audience feels a sense
of responsibility for both
of the characters, and the
“The audience
is drawn into
this weirdly
wonderful
production
further
by Cally’s
interaction
with its
members”
writing manages to instill
a sense of empathy for
both, as the central themes
of self-destructiveness,
loss, anxiety and lack of
fulfilment are common
feelings in most people.
Impatience laces the lines
they deliver, you get a
sense of ‘waiting’ as they
undergo their menial day-
to-day tasks. On occasion,
however, the story is quite
difficult to follow, the
abundance of metaphors
at times unnecessary and
thrusting the audience
into a spiral of trying to
translate the meaning
behind every act. All-in-
all this play is a beautiful
depiction of love, loss and
expectation and delivered
a thought-provoking
perspective on moth-
er-daughter relationships.
The dancing bear in
the opening scene of this
‘Before I was a Bear’
is more than enough to
pull the audience in and
convince them to invest
their full and unfaltering
focus into Cally’s (the
bear) story. Even without
the mask, Cally, is incred-
ibly endearing and relata-
ble. Her complex persona
is portrayed by the actor,
Jacoba Williams, and
writer, Eleanor Tindall,
delivering the line ‘my
voice is bountiful and
heavy and full’ which
introduces the perfect
pitch for the start of this
one-woman-play.
The audience is drawn
into this weirdly wonder-
ful production further by
Cally’s interaction with its
members, handing indi-
viduals a variety of props
she uses in the play. Cally
describes the transition
from the ‘unstoppable’
feelings of childhood
to the insecurities and
obsessions of the young
teenager with startling
accuracy, her eager smile
and fervent way of com-
municating her arguments
with her brother reflecting
her youth. Some of the
more impactful themes of
this play is its exploration
of friendship and sexual-
ity. The unstable nature
of friendship is explored
in her account of events
and the roles of perspec-
tive and self-interest are
conveyed with profound
accuracy.
The main storyline is
centralized around her
obsession and affair with
a married TV detective.
It reflects the modern
problems surrounding
social media and the ten-
dencies of society towards
villainization and victim-
ization of women in an
address which rang with
an Attwood-like analysis.
Her subsequent isolation
is explored through her
life as a bear, her shame,
herlackofselfcareandher
feelings of not belonging.
Cally’s pain is delivered
profoundly in the words
‘they want me dead.’ The
feelings of loneliness
and self-doubt are rife
throughout this play. Its
delivery is combined with
plenty of humour and it
provides the audience
with an enjoyable evening
but its analysis of the
more modern issues of
society, specifically for
young women, are what
make this play most worth
the watch.
The production itself
is given a more ‘home-y’
feel by the surroundings.
The Bunker Theater is
a small former parking
garage down a nonde-
script alley which was
difficult to locate but
worth the search. Mis-
matching chairs surround
the small stage and fairy
lights are hung along the
ceiling- it’s a perfectly
Instagrammable place.
For any potential viewers,
however, I would recom-
mend maybe bringing a
pillow if attending the
double bill production,
the chairs are designed for
their aesthetic not for their
comfort. The audience
and the staff helped to
make the environment
even warmer, investing
fully in the characters
from the start to the end
of the show, laughing up-
roariously at appropriate
points and more impor-
tantly listening when the
scene required it.
Overall the experience
was an extremely enjoya-
ble one, with credit going
to both the environment
and the skills of the actors.
On a more personal note,
on further research I
found out that the Bunker
Theatre is to close down
in 2020, which feels like a
loss to the arts community
of London. The friendly
feel to the theatre itself is
unmissable and the skill
of the actors and writers
it supports make it even
more of a must-see.
