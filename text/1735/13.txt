COMMENT

Comment Editor
I
t would appear that
I have drawn the ire
of two commentators
due to articles that I
wrote a couple of weeks
ago. This is the last issue
in which such an exchange
will feature as there are
other issues that deserve
our attention.
Before moving into
the bulk of my response,
I would like to make the
following statements. Jun
Liu’s article is very keen
to point out that I have
broken UK law. I would
encourage him to take
these charges to the police.
However, I would warn
him that wasting police
time is also an offence. I
would also appreciate it if
Yuchu Liu could read the
content of my article more
closely. I specifically
stated that “I am absolute-
ly not accusing the author
of acting on behalf of the
CCP.” Do not mischarac-
terise what I have said, it
is intellectually dishonest
and beneath us all.
Responding to two
demands for apology is
more challenging than
responding to one. There-
fore, I shall make the
following argument.
China in the inter-
national sense is a na-
tion-state actor. Although
it may act in concordance
with the will of the people
of China, it is distinct
from the people of China.
It takes the decisions and
leads, and as such it must
be treated as the responsi-
ble party for actions that
China as a nation state
commits. The conflation
of the people of China,
with the government of
China is a fundamental
ideological leap that I
refuse to make. In order
to make that association,
one must suffer from a
surfeit of nationalism.
This prevents an individ-
ual from making rational
and reasoned criticisms
(or praise) of the govern-
ment of the country in
which one lives. I believe
that the articles by the
authors preceding these
pages illustrate this point
perfectly. Both authors
associate themselves with
their government and
its actions to a degree
where providing factually
inaccurate and factually
incomplete information is
the only way to reconcile
themselves with the situa-
tion as it is.
As an example of
providing a non-national-
istic assessment of one’s
government I would
say, in terms of foreign
policy, the UK over the
last twenty years, but
by no means only in the
last twenty years, made a
terrible decision to invade
Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hundreds of thousands of
civilians died and the UK
has failed to investigate its
soldiers that are accused
of war crimes. This is
of course, unacceptable.
However, the UK govern-
ment lets me write these
things without throwing
me in prison and beating
me, as has been the fate of
multiple Chinese journal-
ists and activists. Thank
you, the UK government.
I would briefly like to
dive into the response
articles that I received to
examine examples of a
not-so honest examination
of facts. A good example
that appears in both
articles is the denial that
Tiananmen square was a
massacre. The events on
4th of June 1989 were the
culmination of months of
mostly peaceful protests
that were eventually met
with bullets and the steel
of Chinese tanks. It is true
that around 20 Chinese
soldiers and policemen
were killed by protesters
and many more were
wounded. However, it is
also true that many more
civilian, unarmed protest-
ers were brutally killed or
wounded by the Chinese
security forces and many
more were subsequently
arrested. Estimates range
between 300-1000 killed,
with many thousands
being wounded.
Yuchu Liu’s piece
make an extensive refer-
ence to what he describes
as “so-called re-education
camps.”Hisarticlefrankly
and honestly admits to the
camp’s purpose of arbi-
trarily detaining an entire
ethnic group. However, he
feels it is justified because
, in his words, as Muslims
they are vulnerable to
becoming terrorists. This
is of course, an obscene
attempt to justify the
presumption of guilt
of Uyghur and Khazak
minorities in Xinjiang,
simply because of their
ethnicity and religious
practices. There is
currently an aggressive
come a very long distance
away from the initial mass
peaceful protests. Despite
the violence of the Hong
Kong police and various
underhand strategies used
by the pro-China side,
such as the involvement
of the Triads, I do not
think that petrol bombing
and amateur archery is the
way forward. However,
at the same time, I think
the dogmatic response of
“Hong Kong is China” is
unhelpful for the resolu-
tion of this situation. At
the root of the conflict is
the fact that some areas
of China have separatist
sentiments and China
has responded to these
separatist sentiments with
varying levels of brutality
and inhumanity. The right
to self determination is
enshrined in the United
Nations charter, which
China is signed up to. To
deny the opportunity of
Hong Kongers to deter-
mine their own future for
themselves is in itself an
overly repressive response
to the issues of separatism
and a symptom of the
increasingly assertive
behaviour of China on the
international stage.
Overall, I am afraid
that this debate has failed
to convince me that I need
to apologise. In fact, it
has convinced me of the
opposite. Instead of com-
plying with Yuchu Liu’s
demand that I “keep my
mouth shut, ” I’ll probably
just be more mouthy than
ever.
I will leave you, dear
reader, with this: Free

reveal the discrimination
that ethnic minorities in
Xinjiang face from the
Chinese government.
More interestingly, it also
shows that not all Chinese
state operators agree with
the measures enforced
there. 12000 investiga-
tions into local officials
have been opened for
failures to pursue repres-
sive policies with suffi-
cient zeal. Yuchu Liu’s
position is not one of duty.
It is a personal choice to
defend the indefensible.
When it comes to
Hong Kong, it is true
that reporting in Western
media has been more than
partial. The violence of
the current protests has
