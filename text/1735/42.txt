ast week 5
EEE students,
Thomas, Noé,
Joao, Lucas and
Luccas, set off to find
out if Woodward actually
exists. Taking to the water
in a simple raft they set off
from College at 5:30 in
order to be able to make it
back “to Salsa at two”.
Their voyage, coming
after hours of study of
both satellite and OS
maps, seemed to be well
on its way and the crew
dared to hope that they
might in fact make it to
their destination without
further difficulty.
They were confounded,
however, by the realisa-
tion that someone had
forgotten to put the bung
in the boat and that the
boat was sinking beneath
the grubby waters of the
London canal network.
Tested beyond anything
they had faced before, the
crew managed to make it
to the bank before being
swallowed up by London
muck.
NegaFelix spoke to
Joao, one of the survivors
of the downing of the raft
and he had this to say
“This was an eye-opening
moment for me. For the
first time, I realised that
machine learning was not
the solution to all of my
problems”
Luckily the team was
able to pull together in
this darkest of times.
Luccas, the most moist
member of the team,
tells us “Rafting with my
mentors is dangerous,
because I give them all
my trust. When things
go wrong, I have to pray
and hope I will make it to
Linear Algebra the next
day”. The crew rallied,
put the raft on their heads
and forged onwards.
It was at 8:45 as the
sun began to come up
that the next disaster
struck. The team ran out
of roasted corn, the one
energy source that they
had thought to bring with
them. “This is the sort of
scenario for which you
can never prepare” says
Lucas. Thankfully, the
team was comprised of
highly skilled individuals:
Noé had trekked 250km,
self supported, in the
arctic ; Joao survived for
10 days in wild Sicily;
and Thomas asked a girl
out once.
At long last the storied
heights of Woodward
peaked over the horizon,
the huge grey buildings
rendering the explorers
temporarily speechless.
Here for the first time
was tangible proof of
Woodwards existence.
The fauna was eerie, the
instantly recognisable
blended seamlessly with
the alien, herds of exotic
art students wearing
strange bohemian clothes
strolled past solitary engi-
neers wearing JP Morgan
“insight day” t-shirts.
The adventurers
approached the building
cautiously, unsure of
the response they would
receive from the guards
at the Woodward gates.
They were pleasantly sur-
prised to be welcomed in
by admiring security staff.
When asked an anony-
mous guard said “This has
been one of the greatest
days of my career. I am
used to dealing with
foolish drunk students but
never daring explorers”
When NegaFelix
reached out for comment
we received this statement
“This discovery comes as
a shock to us and we are
currently investigating the
situation. We are happy to
hear that they made it alive
but we want to highlight
that we deny any connec-
tion between College and
their finding.”
Disclaimer: This ex-
pedition came with legal
challenges, and a signifi-
cant amount of planning
was done prior to the trip.
Please do not attempt it by
yourself.
