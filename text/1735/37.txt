An Interview with the student-led Varsity Careers Hub
Felix: Tell us where
the idea came from,
what inspired you to
develop platform,
and the story of how
that came to be from
concept through to
the current stage
you’re at?
Ahana: VCH’s vision is
to streamline the process
of graduate recruitment.
This is something that
I have personally faced
when applying to intern-
ships – you have to repeat
the same information a
lot of times in a lot of
different places, and it’s
a very time-consuming
process. It puts some
students off of even
applying to certain jobs
in certain industries, and
it can oftentimes deflect
from academic studies.
That was a problem that
we wanted to see to.
Felix: A lot of people
would look at this as
shifting power away
from the employer
and towards the
jobseeker in terms
of time commitment
and expectation. Was
that something you
feel was deliberate-
ly there during the
process?
Luana: Personally for
me, it’s about students
having an opportunity
to be in contact with
companies they wouldn’t
usually be in contact with
or know about – more
niche or boutique compa-
nies in a certain industry,
which may not have the
large brand presence that
all students would know
about.
Ahana: To start with,
we had big companies
sign up to use the service
– Morgan Stanley, UBS,
and others. These are
places that have enough
applicants; they don’t
experience this issue. But
they wanted to use the
service to supplement
what they already have
with their graduate re-
cruitment teams.
The real gap in the
market that we are trying
to fill is for smaller to
medium sized companies
– top students from top
unis are only applying
to big companies (say,
Goldman Sachs), which
only have a limited
number of positions and
for which there is fierce
competition. But there are
a lot of other companies
whichalsoofferequivalent
salaries, experiences, and
opportunities, but which
students don’t know about
and which don’t have
the same infrastructure
and manpower to have a
strong presence on uni-
versity campuses. So part
of my job as part of client
acquisition is to identify
these very high-quality,
smaller-to-medium size
companies and match
them with students that
they ordinarily might not
have managed to reach
out to, and so to allow
students to get a great job
they might otherwise have
missed out on.
Felix: On the site,
you talk about some
set of parameters
by which you assess
companies for inclu-
sion – can you talk
about those?
Ahana: At the moment,
we’re a student startup so
it is somewhat up to our
discretion and personal
experience, but we’ve
tried to construct our team
out of people who have
had some sort of industry
experience – like people
who have good connec-
tions in the industry, or
have a good commercial
sense of it – in a variety
of sectors, so that choice
is honed by expertise. The
basic criteria we look for
include things like general
reputation. We then also
utilise other rankings,
such as the TARGETjobs
top 300 employers – we
can leave a lot of the ‘dirty
work’to the professionals,
for now, and use those
available resources.
Felix: Are you look-
ing to incorporate
things like anecdotal
experiences from
students who have
taken placements at
a company?
Ahana: Absolutely.
However, we are not yet
quite at the scale, and have
not quite been around long
enough, to see students
through the entire process
of being hired and un-
dergoing internships and
such. Most clients we’re
in discussions with will
predominantly begin
using VCH for next year’s
recruitment cycle.
We do always encour-
age feedback on all sides.
On the client acquisition
side, I’m always asking
companies how we can
improve and better service
their needs. On the student
side, we have a really
strong team of people
across all the universities
who work directly with
the students being hired.
We also want companies
to be giving feedback
on the students – which
they can then use on their
profile to strengthen it, if
they so desire.
Luana: The structure
we have for that is inter-
esting. We’re currently
looking to expand our
network, at Imperial espe-
cially, but also at Durham,
LSE, UCL, and Oxbridge.
We’d like a lot more
students to join, but also
student advisors. Each
student advisor would
report to me. Their role
would be to help obtain
things like society partner-
ships – such that societies
and their members could
benefit from connecting
with us, such as from
networking events and
information. My plan at
Imperial is that when we
partner with societies we
would ask one of their
committee members to
be the student advisor for
that society, and would
run that section of the
VCH for their society.
As a student advisor,
you’d also liaise with the
companies to talk about
how to best provide for
the students who want to
undertake their intern-
ships.
Felix: On the student
side – you’re specifi-
cally so far looking at
a specific set of very
elite universities,
mostly in a particular
geographic region.
Why those universi-
ties?
Ahana: That’s just
how we’ve started – we
definitely have plans to
continue to expand, and
are currently in the process
of expanding to Warwick.
We certainly aim to bring
more universities on
board, as we think it will
help everyone.
But we’re setting it up
so that there are enough
people on the team at
each university to provide
proper support to ensure
the project thrives – which
involves a lot of time
commitment. The long-
term plans are to not only
expand to the rest of the
UK, but also to Europe in
the next two years and – if
all goes well – to the US
within the next five.
Ahana: For the time
being, considering where
we are at, VCH would be
Russell-Group-oriented.
The nature of the jobs and
companies we are working
with at the moment
specifically headhunt for
top students. If we help
even some students get a
good job, then we have
succeeded in our goal.
Felix: Funding-wise,
does all funding
come from compa-
nies that pay to use
the service, and is it
free for students?
Ahana: Yep, absolutely.
We would never want to
charge students to use
the service – that would
completely go against
what we are trying to do!
We charge companies
based on their size and
based on how much they
use the database. It also
varies from sector to
sector – some companies
have specific recruitment
times, such as summer
internships, with only a
short recruitment cycle, so
we plan around that.
Felix: What about the
experience of being
part of VCH?
Luana:Intermsofbeing
a student advisor, there are
a lot of networking events
to be involved with, lots
of free merch, and so on.
We want to make VCH a
society at Imperial, for the
student advisors, where
we can meet and discuss
our goals and actions.
We’ll run pub nights and
things as well – we want
to build up the network
organically and socially.
Ahana: That applies to
all aspects of the business.
If you’re someone who is
well-connected and wants
to work on the client side
and get exposure to some
great companies, there
are opportunities within
the team. The tech we’re
using is also our primary
focus right now, so there
are plenty of opportunities
for student developers
to get involved too. As
Luana said, on the student
side, the marketing and
the fun events – there’s
a lot of opportunities for
people who want to be
involved.
Felix: Are you liais-
ing with the College
about this at all, such
as the Careers Ser-
vice, or is this entirely
independent?
Luana: We did get in
touch with the Careers
Service, but they weren’t
interested! They offered
us a stall at their Careers
Fair, but a stall is very
expensive so we couldn’t
take advantage of that.
However, the Physics
Careers Group has sent
out emails to physics
students and such. Mostly,
no – this is student-led.
However, we’d be keen to
work with any department
to help their students get
access to the best possible
jobs and internships.
