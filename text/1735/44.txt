TRIVIA
Hello! Apparently, some baka (aka me) created a rule in Outlook that
allowed us to sort through each week‚Äôs submissions (everyone that
says 1735 in their email gets put in the 1735 folder). Submissions got
messy. Emails were lost before we could mark them. People wrote
us emails with words in them (instead of pictures). We apologise for
this sorry state of affairs, and will be responding to everyone who
submits, (we usually reply on Fridays). Thank you for your continued
patience with us.
