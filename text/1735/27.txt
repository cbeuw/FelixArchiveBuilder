the very first sentence of
the book. With this out of
the way, the book focuses
on the long-running (10
years, to be exact) West
End show, Thriller Live!,
how it was conceptualised
and how it has come
together.
Written by Gary Lloyd,
the director and the cho-
reographer of the stage
show, the book doesn’t
quite read like an autobi-
ography, but a collection
of diary entries, essays,
press releases and more;
and it starts with the day
of Jackson’s shocking
death. It is safe to say
that Jackson was gone too
soon, and Lloyd artfully
explores how this affected
him, and others involved
with him professionally
and personally. Lloyd
jumps from decade to
decade, talking about
the day he was born, his
childhood, the influence
“Lloyd talks
about the
influence of
Jackson’s
music on his
upbringing
and his life to
this day”

I
t seems quite ironic
to me that the author,
despite the title, has
never actually met
Michael Jackson. In fact,
this admission comes as
of Jackson’s music on his
upbringing and his life to
this day.
Having said all that, I
am struggling to decide
who this book is catered
for. Big fans of Jackson
would not be able to
uncover what was behind
the mask or feel closer to
the King of Pop in any
way. Fans of the stage
show would potentially
find the details of the
show’s inception mildly
fascinating, but at the risk
of being eaten alive or
sounding like a monster,
in no shape of form does
this book feel necessary.
I appreciate the amount
of cultural impact Jack-
son’s music had over
several decades. And this
book does a decent job
at showing how and why
Jackson’s legacy lives on
10 years after his death.
However, the book feels
overly long and without
any real point.
It would be naïve to
expect a book that is
focused on how a stage
show came about and how
it’s been doing since then
to be groundbreaking.
However, the writing
style is chaotic at best, and
dangerously distracting at
worst. It’s not a bad read,
but just like I said before,
it’s not necessary. It’s
human nature to want to
tell how one’s achieved
something as big as
Thriller! Live, however
this doesn’t quite feel like
the right medium to do so.
Now, go back and
count how many Michael
Jackson song titles I’ve
dropped in this article.
Spoiler alert: it’s eleven.
