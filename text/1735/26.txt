FKA Twigs makes album - is good
T
ahliah Barnett,
aka FKA Twigs
quickly rose
from ‘Video
Girl’ to adored songstress
in the mid 10’s, earning
critical acclaim and a cult
following from a series
of releases including her
2014 record LP1. Here,
atmospheric synthesisers
and industrial drums left
plenty of space for Twig’s
vocals to croon, soar or
caress. Whilst being an
aesthetically satisfying
record, one well worth a
listen for any electronic
or art-pop fans, Barnett’s
song writing often felt
hollow and repetitive to
the point of redundancy,
dampening the records
listenability.
On Magdalene Twig’s
lyricism is significantly
more rewarding, adding
a layer of emotional
precocity to her gorgeous
sonic creations. Opener
‘thousand eyes’ sets the
scene, embodying the
terror of celebrity as a
many-eyed-beast, behind
a plodding, orchestral in-
strumental which splinters
intermittently as if Twig’s
insecurity corrupts the
song’s file.
The centrepiece of the
record is its title track.
Here, Barnett explores
the expectations her
lovers, and society have
of her femininity, behind
a powerful hook and
glitched, industrial pro-
duction reminiscent of the
LP’s Cover.
On thematic twin ‘holy
terrain’, Future (of all
people) steps into the fray
to illustrate the fractious
nature of modern mas-
culinity. A feature which
is thematically if not
sonically satisfying.
Much of Magdalene
finds FKA Twig’s eye
turned upon the many
facets of a particularly
complex relationship. The
beauty “Taste the fruit of
me/Make love to all you
see” on ‘sad day’, the
mistrust on ‘fallen alien’;
“Don’t tell me what you
want ‘cause I know you
lie” and the tragedy of no
longer having a partner
to “chase the pain away”
with on ‘mirrored heart’.
Barnett is an artist of few
words, but here the pre-
cision of her writing cuts
through icy instrumentals
to distil truth more poetic
than factual.
Perhaps her best writing
can be found on Magda-
lene’s penultimate tracks.
On closer ‘Cellophane’, a
wonky piano progression
becomes the scaffold for
vocal acrobatics, Twigs
delivering lines like
“Didn’t I do it for you?/
When all I do is for you”,
which splay rejection’s
bitter jaws wide. Before
this ‘daybed’ oozes by
over clouds of synth,
Twigs works to capture
the ugly character the
everyday takes on during
a depressive episode
“Dirty are my dishes/
Many are my wishes”
and “Lower is my ceiling/
Pressing are my feelings”
distil this uniquely 21st
century malaise perfectly.
‘daybed’ is also notable
for production by Oneo-
htrix Point Never, erring
from near silence, muffled
percussion and shots of
white noise to oppressive
organs and orchestral
flourishes, each moment
feels tailored to the ebb
and flow of Barnett’s
delivery.
The rest of Magda-
lene’s track list features an
equally impressive roster
of producers: Skrillex,
Cashmere Cat, Kenny
Beats, and Berlin-based
wunderkind Nicholas Jarr
have all played their hands
on tracks. The result is a
collection of fascinating
instrumentals, with well
written chord progres-
sions and a plethora of
detail rewarding repeated
listens.
I didn’t get tickets to
see Twigs live so i’m
sad, if you have a spare,

The Old Blue Last hit by furious punk noise
I
hiked up to Shoreditch
last week to catch one
of my favourite bands
at the moment, Girls
in Synthesis, as they played
one of the ‘Fifty Fest’ shows
to promote the new music
on the bill for Brighton’s
The Great Escape Festival.
Before GiS came The Cool
Greenhouse, who offered
up low-key Talking Heads-
esque tunes, complete with
synthy sounds. While the
band played tightly together,
their music seemed to need
maturing, but you could
easily tell they were looking
at the start of something
good, just needing a few
more years maturing before
that emerges. Having seen
GiS once before I set the
bar extremely high for what
I expected - mainly furious
political messages set to ab-
solute uproar. GiS managed
to blow all assumptions of
what I was going to see out
the water. As their set started
bassist John Linger asked to
have the lights off, plunging
us into semi-darkness with
a spotlight throwing up
Linger and guitarist Jim
Cubitt’s shadows across the
stage. They didn’t stay there
for long though and soon
were both in the audience
accompanied by their mics
as drummer Nicole Pinto
provided a heavy beat to the
chaos. ‘Tainted’, the band’s
take on Trump, set off the
band and crowd alike into a
frenzy, pumping pure angry
punk energy through the
room, irresistible to ignore.
It was refreshing to see
a band not glued to their
mics, or the stage even, and
who were very happy to
relinquish control of both in
a set that was victorious in
assaulting as many senses
as possible. Linger managed
to fight back onto the stage
in time for ‘Howling’, a
fuzzy, swooning interlude
in the set, before jumping
back into their new song
‘Arterial Movements’. For
GiS classics ‘The Mound
and ‘We Might Not Make
Tomorrow’, the audience
swarmed over the band,
casting them aside from
their mics and leaving them
struggling to play their own
songs. Overall it was explo-
sive, abrasive, aggressive
and any other –ive adjectives
you can think of. After their
set I stayed to recover before
the tube home, and managed
to catch Do Nothing, a
funky, punky band hailing
from Nottingham. Frontman
Chris Bailey seemed to take
the lead here, often distract-
ing us from the actual music,
which wasn’t dissimilar
again from Talking Heads
mixed this time with LCD
Soundsystem. Bailey seemed
to put on an act which came
across as a deadbeat, obnox-
ious salesman, certainly an
interesting stage persona for
any band. Do Nothing’s bops
weren’t terrible, but after the
attack from GiS they just
didn’t quite sound as good as
they should have.
