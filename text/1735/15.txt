Imperial College DramSoc Presents: 11 Miles
B
ased on the real
journal entries,
11 Miles follows
Captain Scott’s
journey to the South Pole
with his four companions:
Evans, Wilson, Bowers,
and Oates. The audience
comes to understand
the meaning behind “11
miles” during the play as
they hear about the trag-
edies that struck the team
on the way back.
Presented by our very
own Imperial College
DramSoc, the intense
physical and mental
hardships endured by the
original explorers were
captured effectively by
the actors: Hamish Mac-
donald, Lucy Chandler,
Alfred Engedal, Alex
Jones and Annie Knight.
Throughout the play,
each character reveals
their own insecurities
and internal conflicts; the
acting in those personal
scenes were incredible.
From Scott feeling
responsible for their unex-
pected circumstances; and
Wilson lack of self-belief
to Oates’ homesickness,
each scene exhibited a
genuine human side of
the characters as they let
out the pent up emotions.
The yelling and disputes
within the team also
manifested the level of
stress and their flawed and
human response to the
stress they were under was
something the audience
could really relate to,
some of them with tears in
their eyes.
Despite taking place
in a small meeting room,
the lighting, designed by
Kacper Neumann, was
clever and compensated
for the limited stage space
they had. The scenes
outside and inside the
tent were differentiated
by lighting up the whole
stage and spotlighting
the tent respectively. The
sound effects, designed
by Harman Chang, further
enhanced this transition,
as they altered the volume
of the windstorm which
made the audience feel as
if they were sat inside a
warm tent or stood outside
in the extreme cold with
the team. The deafening
storm added to the tension
on-stage but unfortunately
drowned out Scott’s last
few lines.
The costumes, props
and set design by Kay
Parker-Hunt and Becky
Rogers were also well
thought out. The few cans
of beans had no labels
on and looked rusted,
emphasising the fact that
they were the last sources
of food the team had left.
Winter hats and gloves
were put on and taken off
every time they left and
returned to the tent. The
tent, set in the middle
of the stage, though
minimal, played a critical
role, portraying the line
between life and death for
the team.
Overall the production
retold the story of theTerra
Nova Expedition in an
authentic and emotionally
touching way. Highlight-
ing the personal struggles
of the team members,
while also focusing on the
bonds between and sac-
rifices for each other, 11
Miles was a professional
production by DramSoc.
I hope we will have more
opportunities to see their
talent in the future.
Touching the Void Review
B
ased on Joe
S i m p s o n ’ s
mountaineering
memoir and
adapted by David Greig,
Touching the Void is a
story about the adventures
of Joe and Simon to Siula
Grande in the Peruvian
Andes. As the double
meaning of the title infers,
the significant factor of
the play are the feelings
of the characters and their
fear of being and dying
alone. Since people with
more ordinary lives also
share these emotions, fo-
cusing on them so deeply
makes the play relatable,
distinguishing it from
other survival stories.
The direction is innova-
tive and creative utilising
minimal props. The tables
and chairs in a bar become
a foothold, the base camp
and rocks on a mountain
road. The simple set de-
sign draws attention to the
details of other parts of
design such as their moun-
taineering equipment and
clothing, giving the play
a realistic feel. The audi-
ence’s perspective chang-
es as they freely alter the
orientation of the stage. In
some scenes, they see the
vastness of the mountain
from the foot as Sarah, Si-
mon and Richard look up
to the ceiling of the the-
atre, while in others, the
auditorium is set inside a
crevasse, as Joe is hung
from the top of the theatre
with a single rope.
The astonishing cast of
four is the crucial element
that makes the complex
plot, which relies greatly
on the audience’s imagi-
nation, work. The hyste-
ria and sorrow provoked
by Josh William’s (Joe),
Fiona Hampton’s (Joe’s
sister) and Angus Yellow-
lees’(Simon) performanc-
es contrasted with Patrick
McNamee’s (Joe’s com-
panion), which brought
comic relief to the play
and laughter to the on-
lookers. Joe and Simon’s
life-threatening journey
is represented on an im-
mense metallic and paper
structure elevated on stage
which represents the dif-
ferent parts of the moun-
tain. They accurately en-
acted techniques used in
mountaineering recreates
the scene in a way that re-
minds the crowd of visual
effects one usually ex-
pects from films.
With its originality and
inventiveness, Touching
the Void allows the audi-
ence to explore Joe and
Simon’s extraordinary ad-
venture in a thrilling and
emotive way as it spot-
lights the limits of human
tolerance when in peril.
