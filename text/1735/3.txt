Food in Union Stops Due to Electrical Fault; “No
Timeline” on Return
T
he Union has
not been pro-
viding food
service in 568,
its flagship venue on the
South Kensington cam-
pus, for two weeks. The
cause of the disruption
is an “electrical fault”
– specifically, that the
circuit board to which
the various kitchen ap-
pliances are attached to
was being overloaded.
As a result, there are
health and safety concerns
around continuing to use
the kitchen appliances. In
a concurrent but reported-
ly unrelated electrical fault
in the kitchens behind
the Union Dining Hall, a
member of staff received a
minor electric shock.
The issue has arisen
concurrently with the pro-
motion of the health and
safety committee within
the Union’s structure,
and recent considerations
of employing a member
of staff whose sole remit
is health and safety (dis-
cussed in this week’s A
Conversation With section
of Felix.)
There is currently no
timeline on when food
service may return to 568,
though there may be food
by the end of this week ac-
cording to Fifi Henry, the
Union’s Deputy President
(Finance and Services).
Rough estimates from
various members of Union
staff place the expected
wait at several weeks,
potentially through to the
beginning of second term
in January. A replacement
“pizza vendor” service
will come into place next
week in Beit Quad as an
start of term, the kitchens
were subject to a standard
inspection by an Envi-
ronmental Health Officer,
who raised concerns with
certain processes not
being followed correctly.
However, Abhijay raised
assurances that the prob-
lems flagged during the
inspection could now be
dealt with, specifying
that some of the issues
arose due to staffing va-
cancies – especially in the
Head Chef position – and
throughout the Commer-
cial Services directorate
but that those vacancies
have now been filled.
Concerns have also
been expressed about how
this will affect bar staff, as
well as the Union’s finan-
cial status. Fifi clarified
with regards to the former
that staff will not miss out
on shifts; they will instead
be reshuffled in order to
fill in shifts that would
previously be covered by
agency staff.
The financial impact
is, as of yet, unknown.
Food sales’ importance
is now prioritised for the
bars, and for the Union as
a source of income, due
to declining drink sales
in recent years and the
launch of the new menu at
the start of the year, and so
the expected impact may
be large. However, with
the close of food service
also comes a reduction in
costs – in costs for agency
staff, for produce, and so
on. The Union typically
runs a full financial
assessment at the start of
each academic year, but
revisits it in January – the
ramifications financially
of the loss of food sales
will only become apparent
at that time.
Specifically with
regards to the kitchen on
the ground floor – which
services 568 – the Union
President, Abhijay Sood,
explained: “my under-
standing is that people
have been violating
normal health and safety
procedures – there are
members of staff in the
bars who have been
continuously resetting
tripped circuit breakers in
order to keep appliances
operational.”
Key to note is that these
issues are not new – they
have existed for some
time, though this is the
first time the Union is be-
coming aware of them, so
it is impossible to say how
long they have existed for.
Typically, electrical prob-
lems such as these would
fall under the remit of one
of College’s divisions,
Estates. However, Union
bar and kitchen staff were
not successfully reporting
the problem to Estates
while they were ongoing,
and were implementing
temporary fixes them-
selves in an effort to keep
the kitchen running.
“There has not been a
strong culture of adher-
ence to proper protocol,”
Abhijay said.
This has not deterred
an ongoing working
relationship, however.
College’s Campus Ser-
vices division has been
providing support to the
Union, delivering a food
service for external clients
the Union has booked in.
“The Head of Campus
Services, Jane Neary, has
been especially helpful,
as well as Nick Roalfe
and Surrinder Johal, the
Directors of Facilities and
Property Management,
and Safety respectively.
We want to form closer
relationships, and look
at how the College and
Union can work better
together,” said Julia.
Additionally, the
College is aiding in con-
ducting electrical testing
of the circuit boards as

interim measure.
Regarding the long
expected wait for return
of service, Julia Matting-
ley, the Union’s Head of
Commercial Services,
said “We don't just want
to put a sticking plaster
on an axe wound - we
need to sort out the fun-
damental problems, not
just symptoms but causes,
so that we aren't just back
in the same place in a few
months’ time.”
well as PAT tests on all the
light and heavy equipment
in the kitchens, as well as
liaising with the Union
about bringing Union
spaces into alignment
with College standards.
This is not the first
notice of procedural issues
in the 568 kitchens, or of
health and safety issues
in the Union. Prior to the

weeks, if not
through to
