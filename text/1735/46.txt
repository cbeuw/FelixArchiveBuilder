Carnage in Canterbury
“This

I
n wake of Canterbury
pipping the Imperial
Mens 2nd team to
the post last week,
the 1s headed out with
vengeance and hunger
in their hearts. The type
of vengeance felt when
you twig on to the fact
your flatmate has been
knowingly using your
milk without the common
decency of asking. We
were going for blood…
(hehe and boy did we get
it.)
As we took to the pitch
one thing was glaringly
obvious. These chaps
were blind. Either that or
they had never looked in
a mirror to observe the
colour clashing monstros-
ity that was their kit. Let
me paint you a picture…
Imagine walking into a
bathroom store and saying
to the ineptest looking
employee: “Excuse
me good sir, do you by
chance sell floor tiling?”
They gaze at you taking
a few seconds to register
what you have said and
respond, “yu hu, any
pattern in particular?”
To which you let out a
gleeful: “Oh why aren’t
I glad you asked! Yes, in
fact do you sell a set of
mismatching tiles that
are an orgy of red?” well
that kids… that was their
playing top. Accompanied
by horridly blood red
shorts. Anyway, I divulge.
From the kick-off it
was clear they were in
for a terrible day. There
wasn’t a single player on
their team that would be
able see their tinkles in the
showers past all their chub
and so we were ready to
run them ragged. With
numerous meat chops
from the likes of Seen
and Toby ‘the destroyer
of worlds’ Daniels, it
wasn’t even five minutes
in until we secured the
first penalty, converted by
Algeria’s finest. Instantly
followed by a line break,
a cheeky kick and some
sexy pressure, we were
again playing rugby in
their 22. Executing unbe-
lievablestrikemoves,with
both precision and flair it
wasn’t long until the boys
in putrid red buckled and
Tube trundled over for the
first try of the game, with
quite frankly, ease.
At this point, their
fans whom last week
wouldn’t stfu could see
the fruitlessness in their
endeavours to taunt us as
we were quite frankly un-
wavering. So they decided
to change tact; one of our
sexier players who goes
by the name of Matt
Speechley (ladies he is on
FB) plays on the wing and
with a chiselled jaw as
prominent as the refs bald
spot he attracted quite the
female attention. “11,11,
are you single?” “11,11,
what’s your number?”
“Give us a wave 11…
oooohhhhh he waved!”
These were just some of
the questions I was able
to earwig on as I zoomed
across the pitch. Me-
ownnnnnn. A few stellar
territorial kicks later and
Big Bad Bagguley gave
the one-handed show and
go, selling every single
player on their team,
providing a VAT receipt
and all, to waltz over the
line for IC’s second try.
A matter of minutes later,
IC were awarded a scrum
on the halfway line. For
once the Canterbury pack
decided to put all their
mass to use and put us
on the back-foot. Do not
fret dearest reader, for Ali
Bagguley with his quick
wit picked up the ball
again in one hand and off
he went down the pitch,
offloading it to Imperials
very own Faf De Klerk
who was heinously high
tackled in a bid to prevent
what would inevitably
have been another try.
This resulted in an imme-
diate penalty and through
Faf’s ingenious quick
thinking, a quick tap and
a few moments later he
was over the whitewash.
Third try to the boys in
blue. Frankly at this point
I have lost track of the
score. This saw the end of
the first half.
Some more perfectly
executed Munster’s,
Kiwis and territorial kicks
later saw their nine (who
had the most disgusting
ponytail/bob thing going
on top of his bonce)
scrambling in D, franticly
kick the ball straight to
sexy 11 in open play and
following the ego boost he
had received from all of
his first half compliments
nobody was going to stop
him from getting over the
line. I am almost certain
I saw him give a cheeky
wink and wave to one of
