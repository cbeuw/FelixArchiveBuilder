rumour about Chinese
government selling
organs from executed
prisoners. If we use logic
(which I am probably
lacking according to Mr.
Titmuss), the Chinese
government is oppressive
and has absolute control
on everything, why would
it care about the few
organs from an executed
prisoner? There are loads
of ways that the govern-
ment can make money,
much more than selling
organs, so why would
Chinese government
do that? Besides, Mr.
Titmuss used the word
“suspected.” If anyone
an accuse others just
because they are suspect-
ed of doing something, oh
well, I don’t know what I
should say. Oh wait, the
UK actually did this right?
The UK and the US sus-
pected Iraq had weapons
of mass destruction and
bombed it completely.
Did they find anything?
What was that substance
displayed in UNSC? Are
you sure it is biochemical
weapons rather than some
washing powder? I was
very curious about this
rumour so I did some
research, and what I found
is that executed prisoners
was a major source of
organs few decades ago
because by that time
organ donation was ex-
tremely rare among the
public be the demand was
high. However, by law
(this law has expired), the
use of prisoners’ organs
must meet the following
requirements first (there is
no official translation so I
translated it):
1. No one claims the
corpse
2. The family refuses
to claim the corpse
3. The executed
prisoner agrees to donate
if either 1 or 2 is met
4. The executed
prisoner and his/her
family agree to donate
However, there were
problems indeed. Corrup-
tion was a huge problem
back in time and this was
indeed a source of making
good amount of money for
some corrupted officials,
but the evilness of some
corrupted should not be
the only information used
to judge China as a whole.
Now the selling of organs
has become a crime and
is subject to serious pros-
ecution. No country is
perfect, including China,
but we are willing to
resolve the problems and
change practices when the
situation allows.
The Great Firewall is
what we Chinese call a
double blade. I would
say it causes problem on
Chinese people some-
times. I took the IB during
high school and I had to
write loads of papers in
English. It was quite a pain
as some contents cannot
be accessed from China.
However, I firmly believe
that the benefits brought
by the wall outweighs.
Outside this firewall, what
I saw are medias such as
the Big Bad China, or
sorry, the British Broad-
casting Corporation,
spreading distorted facts
about China. What’s
more, corporations such
as Facebook encourage
the terrorism, hate, and
separatism in China. The
firewall ensures that most
information we get are
positive, and prevents
terrorism. All Chinese
people therefore have
common cause, which is
making China prosperous.
The firewall creates
feasibility for censorship,
and again, its benefits
outweigh the cost.
As mentioned above,
inappropriate content
containing separatism,
terrorism, hate are auto-
matically filtered. If not,
the police can find the
person and prevent any
potential adverse con-
sequences. Mr. Titmuss
may argue that the CCP
tries to brainwash Chinese
people. Well, I think this
is not a serious problem
as we are brainwashed to
believe that we can make
our homeland better by
working hard and uniting
together as a country.
It is better than being
brainwashed by western
medias to believe China is
bad and we should launch
a revolution to take over
CCP.
About the freedom of
speech, I have cited the
ICCPR twice in this and
the previous article. In
China, behaviours like Mr.
Titmuss have, spreading
rumours without evidence
on organ selling, will be
questioned by the police
and punished. Criticising
the government with facts
will not be punished in any
ways. I wrote an article
criticising the inefficiency
of the urban management
and law enforcement de-
partment in the city where
I went to high school.
I posted it on WeChat
which is a Chinese version
Facebook and nothing
happened to me. So here
I will just reemphasise to
Mr. Titmuss that it is not a
problem to criticise China
on what you believed
it has done. Show me
evidence.
China has no interest
to implant its influence
in any other countries.
About foreign companies,
I had discussed it in
the previous article and
Mr. Titmuss made no
response. About foreign
governments, if they don’t
know, do not want to
know, or choose what they
report about Hong Kong,
we want them to keep
mouths shut. If wearing
masks in demonstration
(banned in the UK) and
committing vandalism
is pro-democratic move-
ments, there is certainly
some problem with the
legal system. It is disgust-
ing that the UK when it
colonised Hong Kong,
shot locals when they
launched any movement,
arrest hundreds of them
and beat some to death in
custody, and now criticis-
ing China and the Hong
Kong police officers for
using arms without killing
anyone while facing the
brutal rioters. I suppose
Mr. Titmuss has never
heard of this, just as I
would never heard what
happened in 4th of June,
1989. Sadly Mr. Titmuss
made a wrong assumption.
I know about that, I know
there were people killed,
but they were rioters
even worse than what we
that has nothing to do with
pleasing Beijing. That is
my responsibility, even if
the government does not
issue that morality guide-
line. In addition, I want
to have another message
spread, which is try to
learn about China from
a different perspective. I
have come to London for
more than a month but
I don’t criticise the UK
because I know I don’t
know enough about it. I
will not easily criticise
British politics until I
completely understand
British ways of doing
things (which probably
I will never achieve). I
suppose Mr. Titmuss has
never stayed in China for
more than one month, and
has never conducted any
research on how Chinese
people feel about the gov-
ernment. I recommended
two sources to help you
readers learn about China,
including Mr. Titmuss, but
he declined the Youtube
one and I suppose he has
never read On China.
However, he does not
stop publishing biased,
irresponsible, insulting,
and humiliating contents.
That demonstrates his
arrogance.
Shortly I will conclude
this article that is probably
“lack of logic” and “aims
to please Beijing.” It will
take another thousand
of words if I refute Mr.
Titmuss point by point.
However, the most
important message that
I want you readers to
know is starting to learn
about China from another
perspective. There are
many Chinese students
at Imperial, and they will
tell you about a China that
you will never know from
the medias. If you don’t
want to learn about China,
that’s also great, but please
do not criticise China
unless you have substan-
tial evidence (do not trust
the media). Lastly, Mr.
Titmuss, shame on you for
living in a country that has
England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland as
constituents but being a
supporter for separatism.
“Rioters in
Tiananmen
Square were
even worse...”
see in Hong Kong today.
Soldiers beaten to death
on street, and the rioters
burned their corpses and
hanged them on street
lamps. You will not know
about it because BBC
doesn’t want to tell you.
By writing these
articles, I am not on behalf
of the government, but of
myself only. I mentioned
the difference in values
between the west and
China, and being loyal
to the country has been
a virtue for thousands of
years in China. I wrote
the articles to defend the
reputation of China, but
