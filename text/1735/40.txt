ith science,
we have
m a d e
incredible
advancements: in medi-
cine we have vaccines and
antibiotics, in agriculture
with the engineering of
pest-resistant and more
nutritious crops, and in
travel [self-driving cars
etc.] The world we live in
is becoming increasingly
embedded in science and
technology.
Yet, there are a growing
number of people who
don’t believe in vaccines,
peddlers of genetically
modiﬁed food untruths,
and a whole global energy
sector that still has not yet
transitioned to renewa-
bles. Public understand-
ing of science is hugely
inconsistent to what the
scientiﬁc community
agrees is consensus.
This disconnect
matters. Public discourse
shapes the policies
adopted by governments,
it inﬂuences ethical
thinking, and it guides
the direction of future
research by generating
support and necessary
funding. For this reason,
scientiﬁc discussion
shouldn’t be limited only
to those with science
backgrounds. In order for
governments, businesses,
and other institutions
to make well-informed
decisions, for the public
to be properly informed
on the issues that impact
our increasingly scientiﬁc
world, engaging the public
with science is essential.
How can we communi-
cate science effectively?
There is a balance that
needs to be struck between
conveying the nuances
of scientiﬁc thinking
and being engaging to
non-scientiﬁc audiences.
The purpose of science
communication isn’t
merely to educate and
combat the spread of mis-
information, but it is also
to share wonderment, to
inspire new directions of
research. Figures like Neil
Degrasse Tyson and David
Attenborough come to
mind as ﬁgureheads who
exemplify approachable,
informative engagement
of the public.
However, in academic
communities, public
engagement isn’t as
prized as it should be.
The currency of this
community is the number
of papers published or the
amount of grants received.
This promotes a quantity
over quality mentality,
and perhaps stiﬂes fresh
thinking in favor of target
performance indicators.
In hopes of shedding more
light on the merits for
science communication,
the Science Challenge
aims to make it clear that
effective communication
isn’t as difﬁcult as it
seems.
The Science Challenge
is the annual science com-
munication contest hosted
by the RCSU. Each year,
four questions that will
challenge students to
convey science in an
effective and engaging
manner are released in
December. Students
have until February to
submit either a 1000-
word essay or a 5-minute
audiovisual entry. All
Imperial students, and
high school students in
Y10-Y13 are eligible to
enter. For each question,
one Imperial winner
and one school winner
is chosen. Shortlisted
candidates are invited to
an awards ceremony, held
at a grand London venue;
past venues have included
the House of Lords, the
Royal Institution, and the
Science Museum.
The overall Imperial
winner wins £1000 cash,
and for each individual
question, the winning
Imperial entry wins £250.
(the entrants win, not
the entries) The RCSU
is currently looking into
non-cash prizes to provide
on top of this. In the past
years, an all-expens-
es-paid tour of CERN, or
publication of the essay
in Daily Telegraph have
been granted as prizes.
If you take part in
the Science Challenge
this year, you’ll have
the chance to think
about science in a wider
societal context, you’ll
be encouraged consider
the stakeholders of
science, and perhaps most
appealingly – you’ll gain
communication skills
that are beneﬁcial to you
no matter what industry
you end up in, science or
otherwise.
The Science Challenge
Launch will take place
on December 5th
(Thursday) at 6pm, in
Skempton LT201. Come
to the Launch to ﬁnd out
more about the contest,
to hear the questions and
prizes announced, and see
past winning entries.
