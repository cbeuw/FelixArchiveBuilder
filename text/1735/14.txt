COMMENT

S
ince the election
was announced
a little over two
weeks ago, there
have been some big
movements in the area of
political pacts. With the
Remain Alliance instigat-
ed between the Lib Dems,
Greens and Plaid Cymru
and the Brexit party
making its own unilateral
alliance, some voters find
themselves abandoned.
As with everything
nowadays, Brexit plays a
huge part in this election.
On the remain side, three
parties, the Green’s, Lib
Dems and Plaid Cymru
have formed a remain
alliance in over 60 seats
across the UK. In practice,
this means that in each
seat, they are all throwing
their weight behind the
party with the best chance
to win in a bid to get
strong remain candidates
into Parliament.
This may seem noble to
some: politicians putting
aside their ambitions and
views for the greater good
of a Britain in Europe,.
However Brexit is just
the tip of the iceberg of
political issues facing the
British public. An election
is not a referendum and
uniting behind a single
issue such as Brexit leaves
voters who also care about
other issues lost.
But isn’t Brexit all that
matters? Isn’t Brexit the
issue that will define our
lives forever? The jury is
still out but no issue is big
enough to compromise all
your values for. This may
seem a bit dramatic but let
me paint a picture.
Imagine you are a
Green voter, passionate
about the environment
and excited about strong
socialist policies. Under
this alliance, you are now
inexplicably being pushed
to vote for the Lib Dems
and Jo Swinson. The
same Lib Dems who were
in bed with an austerity
addicted Tory monster.
The same party who sup-
ported the bedroom tax,
benefit cuts and universal
credit. The real kick in the
face is the Lib Dems envi-
ronmental record: voting
to sell forests, encourage
fracking and reduce subsi-
dies for renewable energy.
In over 40 seats, the
Greens have vanished
into thin air, leaving the
Tory-lite Lib Dems with
a rather abhorrent policy
record in charge. Clearly,
the Greta Thunberg’s of
Britain will definitely not
be voting Lib Dem on
December12th.Manywill
probably vote Labour. But
is all this political reshuf-
fling worth it for a couple
of percentage points
more towards a remain
candidate who already has
little chance of winning
for a party which has even
less chance of getting an
overall majority. If this
remain alliance had the
ability to change who
would be our next prime
minister, maybe this
would all be worthwhile
but for having such a small
impact, compromising
core party issues is really
disappointing and dis-
enfranchising genuinely
passionate Green voters.
On the other side of the
chasm, there is the Brexit
Party. This week, their
king, Nigel Farage, made
his own leave alliance. He
decided not to field candi-
dates in seats where there
is a sitting Conservative
member of parliament.
This is a sensible decision
and will reduce the
chances of a split leave
vote allowing remain can-
didates to sneak in. Brexit
is of course Nigel Farage’s
raison d’etre. We can only
hope that after it is all
resolved in the year 2054,
By taking themselves
off the ballot, the Brexit
Party is restricting the
choice of the electorate.
Voters who were inspired
by the party’s pledge of a
real clean Brexit are now
being mugged off and told
to vote for the Tories and
their soft Brexit.
Similarly, with the
Lib Dems, the actual
impact on the outcome
of the election of this
decision is not certain.
The Conservatives really
need to win seats if they
want a majority, and in
many seats, they would
potentially win were a
Brexit Party candidate not
standing. So is this fun-
damental shift in policy
for the Brexit Party worth
it for the little returns it
could yield.
Although the Green
voters being pushed to the
Lib Dems and the Brexit
voters who are being
told to vote Tory have
very little in common in
terms of politics, they
are both being left in the
dust. These groups are
being cheated as they can
no longer vote for what
they truly believe in. This
entire issue stems from
the outdated electoral
system but in a way, these
parties who would like to
see it reformed, are simply
caving in. If all parties had
ran everywhere the result
of this election would
probably have been very
weird due to the vote
splitting it would cause.
However, such a result
could have presented an
even stronger case for
reform and proportional
representation.
I feel sorry for these
voters who may feel lost
and I can only tell them
one thing: Vote Labour.

“The Greens
have vanished
in over 40
seats”
he will simply vanish into
a puff of smoke. This
election presents a real
route for a second ref-
erendum which could end
up halting Brexit. So, for
him, making sure leave
MPs sit on the benches in
the House of Commons is
key.
The oven ready Brexit
deal which Johnson is
pinning much of his cam-
paigning on was initially
rejected by Farage who
called it a “reheating of
Mrs May’s EU Treaty”.
Farage continued to be
very critical of Johnson
and called for an une-
quivocal pledge for a no
deal Brexit. Many voters
agreed with this and saw
his Brexit Party as the only
option for a real Brexit.
