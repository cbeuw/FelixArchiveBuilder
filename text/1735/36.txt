S
tudents of Imperial
College London,
we have been done
a great disservice.
There is a trendy, self-ser-
vice, American burger
place right beside South
Kensington station. And
it’s the one that doesn’t
have a student discount.
If you are tired of a
specific number of men
not appreciating you, you
can do the slight trek to
your closest Shake Shack.
Yes, I know that means
heading to Victoria or
Piccadilly, but they have a
new student deal to make
it worth your while.
Shake Shack now offers
two for the price of one on
their burgers for you and
your study buddy. Your
lab partner will hate you
a lot less for always being
unavailable if you offer to
get them a burger. Simply
show this offer from your
UNiDAYS account which
you all have access to as
students. This deal runs
from Sunday to Wednes-
day, so make sure you are
tactical about your visits.
The deal says that the
two people also have to
be there as you order so
may not be able to finesse
yourself a double serving.
I took a friend down to the
one in Leicester Square
during a day out in Central
to see if it was worth the
trip out.
Like with Pizza Union,
you get a pager with your
“These burgers
are well put
together.
These burgers
manage to
stay awake in
their 9ams”
“All the
textures
and flavours
combining in
each bite made
this one an
experience”
order with their green
logo. In fact, these two
restaurants have a really
similar aesthetic. Green
is their accent colour all
over the store, giving
Halloween vibes against
a black backdrop. Their
seats are mostly arranged
connected to a long table
so you will find yourself
with not a lot of personal
space most of the time.
We got the Double Shack
Burger and the Shack
Stack, coming to £8.75
for the both of us. That
comes out as less for each
of us than the dog food
they sell. Yes, they sell
dog food. And no, I don’t
know why.
Firstly, you’ve got to
appreciate how beautiful
these burgers are. These
burgers are well put
together. These burgers
have done all their
problem sheets. These
burgers go for all their
classes. These burgers
manage to stay awake in
their 9ams. These burgers
submit their coursework
early. These burgers are
on 12 societies’ commit-
tee. These burgers already
have their internships
sorted. And they tasted
good. Really good.
The Double Shack
Burger is the remix for
their classic cheeseburger
now with an extra patty.
The veggies were fresh
and their special Shack-
Sauce really compliment-
ed the whole thing. What
surprised me was for the
original price, the patties
themselves are rather
small. I know it’s quality
over quantity because you
can really taste the differ-
ence compared to your
average burger spot but
at that price, I need thicc
with at least 3 ‘c’s.
The Shack Stack
consists of their cheesy
‘Shroom patty and a beef
patty for good measure.
The ‘Shroom patty was
actually the highlight of
the visit for me and that is
saying something as they
were both so good. I know
the vegetarians reading
this are rolling their eyes
as they don’t need another
mushroom burger, but
this was better than the
actual meat. The deep-
fried breading was crispy
and really well seasoned
yet the mushroom in the
centre wasn’t overdone
and still had its structure. I
got a surprise at the cheese
oozing out of the breading
from my first bite. The
portobello mushroom
adds some serious height
to the burger to mitigate
the beef’s thinness. The
beef still brings a great
contrast to the crispy
mushroom as you bite
through. All the textures
and flavours combining in
each bite made this one an
experience.
Places like Shake Shack
represent a new trend. You
get restaurant quality food
while keeping the fast
food feel to the establish-
ment. The food looks like
there was a lot more care
and effort put into making
it compared to the average
Maccies (though the beef
patties are still the same
size). Everything here
looks and tastes fresher.
Yet there is still no one
pestering you on if you
want any more drinks or
how your meal is going to
get a tip like at a Byron’s
and it stays open later
than a service restaurant.
It’s really the best of both
worlds but this also brings
both disadvantages.
You can’t exactly book
yourself a spot and those
benches can fill up fast
during lunchtime. And
I’ve seen a fair number
of fights break out on my
late-night trips there. It’s
not good for anything
more than a casual meal
with some standards.
Food quality to price ratio
is a very difficult one to
balance but with this deal,
the scales seem to have
tipped in Shake Shack’s
favour.
