Eighth Generation Feels as Fresh as the First
“Grand castles,
clock towers,
charming little
hamlets, and
farm towns
give the world
a huge variety
of scenery.”
“It took me
22 hours to
beat the game
but 6 hours to
even get to the
first gym but
granted I like
to take things
slow...”
Let’s start by covering
the big controversy
surrounding the game in
recent months. Internet
dubbed ‘Dexit’, referring
to the fact that Sword and
Shield does not contain
a national dex (meaning
this game does not contain
every Pokémon ever,
even if you transfer them
from past games), has
infuriated many people.
This is understandable at
the surface level. Every
Pokémon out there is
someone’s favourite, so
you are bound to be upset
by this if you love Bidoof
and find out he’s nowhere
to be found (sorry to the
one person out there that
likes them). However,
I would argue this is a
good thing for 2 reasons.
Firstly, it means people
get to branch out. If you
typically catch the same
Pokémon every game
and have the same tactics
every time, this change
causes you to think dif-
ferently and who knows,
you might even find a
new favourite Pokémon
that you would never
have even considered
using. Secondly, and more
importantly to those who
typically catch EVERY
throughout the years as
the meta game constantly
shifts every year. This
will keep the competition
much more interesting
as it will require players
not only to have a deep
knowledge of the core
mechanics of Pokémon,
but also require players to
be versatile and have the
ability to adapt to changes
implemented in each iter-
ation of the game. Finally,
most people don’t catch
all the Pokémon anyway
so most of the people
complaining are doing so
for no honest reason…
from my experience most
of the people complain-
ing wouldn’t have even
played the game anyway!
Another issue some
have, that I have already
covered, is the use of
low-quality textures and
the re-use of old assets
in animation. Now while
this is annoying in some
aspects, I generally found
that I was too busy staring
into the distance at a
beautiful landscape or
city to notice a blade of
grass being a bit fuzzy.
Equally the animation
quality is not noticeable
because at the end of the
day it’s not possible to
create unique animations
for every Pokémon in the
game using every move.
With the art style being
so refined and clean now
after years of iteration, I
think the actual graphical
fidelity is not something
that should be a focus,
especially not from a
Nintendo game which has
never been renowned for
being a market leader in
resolution and detail alone
(or at least not since the
N64). I will say however
that improving these
issues in the future would
be a welcome change, I
just don’t think it’s rea-
sonable to be outraged by
something which makes
little difference to the
overall experience of a
beloved RPG franchise.
Real Issue
My main issue with
the game, however, is
in its story and pacing.
Generally, main series
games have a great story,
linking in with an evil
team and the legendries of
the region, no spoilers but
this is not really covered
as well as previously
with Team Yell, the ‘evil’
team of gen 8 being little
more than an occasional
nuisance throughout the
game was disappointing,
especially given the lack
of any true ‘dungeon’ to
be found. Equally, I found
the pacing to be quite
uneven. It took me 22
hours to beat the game but
6 hours to even get to the
first gym. Granted I like to
take things slow, but it’s a
bit ridiculous that this is
the case – especially when
you are limited to catching
Pokémon up to level 20
until you beat the first
gym. Luckily after that
the pace picks up a bit, but
almost too fast such that
the story takes back seat
and your only sense of
progression is how far you
can make it through the
wild area. This, coupled
with a disappointing lack
of post-game content was
an unfortunate smudge
on an otherwise gem of a
game.
Verdict
Pokémon Sword and
Pokémon Shield blew me
away and exceeded my
expectations to the fullest.
Despite a somewhat
awkward pacing, the
child-like feeling of
anticipation around every
corner and the awe-in-
spiring view into the
mesmerising Galar region
is one that will not be for-
gotten any time soon. For
people put off by previous
generations, I highly rec-
ommend checking it out;
for any long-term fan of
Pokémon, you will not be
disappointed. This game
is Pokémon to its core and
I loved every minute of it.

hearing you feed back and

As always the logos hint at the look of the legendaries of each game. The classic Red vs Blue returns//Pokemon GO Hub
Pokémon, the compet-
itive scene will benefit
massively. Each game
from now on will have a
meta defined by which
Pokémon are available,
meaningthat you will see a
diverse array of strategies
