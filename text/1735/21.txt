Binge of the week: Fleabag (Seasons 1 and 2)
A perfect blend of comedy and pathos, play-turned-series Fleabag takes you through the journey of a broken,
sexually voracious lady
B
BC’s tragi-
comedy (yes,
this genre
exists) Fleabag
centers around its titular
role Fleabag (played by
Phoebe Waller-Bridge),
a young woman living
in London, with the first
season focusing on the
feelings of guilt and
grief, while the second
exploring the themes of
love and sin. Originally
based on Waller-Bridge’s
2013 one-woman show
that premiered at the
Edinburgh Fringe, the TV
series presents a more
coherent production while
retaining its interactive
nature with the protago-
nist constantly breaking
the fourth wall, voicing
her thoughts out loud to
the audience and staring
straight into the camera
while doing so.
The most difficult part
of the show is certainly
bringing the two worlds
of comedy and tragedy
together, yet Waller-
Bridge executes it flaw-
lessly, both with her sharp
writing and her acting.
Fleabag’s dark, witty
comments are often inter-
twined with her painful
losses. This perfect blend
is not exclusive to Fleabag
but is vividly played
out in other characters
and scenes. The most
thought-provoking words
are often juxtaposed with
the most hysterical jokes,
yet it just works. Both
the scenes where Fleabag
visits her counselor
(played by Fiona Shaw)
and where the business-
woman Belinda (played
by Kristin Scott Thomas)
rants about the pains of
being a woman exem-
plify this tone perfectly.
One way Waller-Bridge
retains the essence of her
one-woman-show in this
series is, as mentioned
before, breaking the
fourth wall. Many who
choose this approach use
a fixed screen and a voice-
over, but Waller-Bridge
directly incorporates this
into her acting, a choice
that is clearly fully inten-
tional This brings out the
comedic elements, even
at the most unexpected
moments and creates a
seamless style of story-
telling that bridges the
play and the series.
“Her way to
cope with
everything
is through
copious
amounts of
sex”
What stands out the
most for me is not the
cinematography nor
the acting but the story
itself. It is meaningful,
impactful, beautifully
written and poignantly
delivered - it’s been a
while since I have related
to a protagonist this much.
The two seasons are so
similar yet so different.
The first season is a
multidimensional story
that unravels as Fleabag
runs away from but even-
tually faces her trauma
and losses and her way
to cope with everything
through copious amounts
of sex. She is both the
hero and the villain. The
very first episode already
hints that Fleabag is
more than just a comedy.
It features Fleabag’s
monologue as she turns
up at her father’s doorstep
at two in the morning, “I
have a horrible feeling I
am a greedy, perverted,
selfish, apathetic, cynical,
depraved, morally
bankrupt woman who
can’t even call herself a
feminist.” Fleabag puts on
a facade of a put-together
woman but when you look
underneath it’s riddled
with insecurities and shat-
tered pieces of her heart.
Sometimes it feels like
we’ve fucked everything
up but it’s life and we
can’t run away from life.
The first season ends
with a speckle of hope
and would have been an
amazing standalone, but
the second season adds
a necessary layer to the
already-perfect show.
In the second season,
we see a brand new
Fleabag, trying to let go
of the past and move on
to the future, and she
meets someone, more
specifically, a Catholic
priest (played by Andrew
Scott, and dubbed as “the
hot priest” all over the
internet). As Fleabag puts
it, “This is a love story.”
Indeed it is but not just
Fleabag’s, but also her
sister Claire’s (played
by Sian Clifford) as well
as her father’s (played
by Bill Paterson) and
godmother’s (played by
Olivia Colman). Here we
see Waller-Bridge delving
deep into many forms of
love, with the iconic line
“I think you know how
to love better than any
of us. That’s why you
find it all so painful.” It’s
amazing that even with
such a short series, there
is phenomenal character
development, and every
Fleabag goes to church // Amazon

Season 1
Season 2
character has a moment
of redemption or vul-
nerability. Every detail,
every scene, every line is
exquisitely crafted. The
ending is heartbreakingly
beautiful, with Alabama
Shakes’s “This Feeling”
adding the perfect touch
to the final scene.
It’s been confirmed that
the second season is the
final season of Fleabag,
perhaps because Waller-
Bridge feels like she has
told the story she needs to
tell. Her brutally candid
writing combined with her
skillful performance has
created a show that is so
endearing, hilarious, and
emotional. It’s so shock-
ingly relatable that I keep
finding shadows of myself
with Fleabag’s every emo-
tional breakdown, and
there is no doubt that this
has risen to the top of the
list of my favorite shows
of all time.
