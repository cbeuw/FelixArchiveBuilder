“Eerie and
unsettling
to know that
someone
somewhere is
listening in on
you”
S
ci-fi based movies
and television
series often show a
person or a group
of people in their mid to
late 20s cut off power to
an entire city by hacking
into a power grid or steal
data from a ‘target’ by
hacking their internet
connected devices. A
well-known example of
this is CW’s “The Flash”,
where satellites, commu-
nication systems, data
centres, power grids, and
security equipment are
hacked into on a regular
basis. Another example,
well known in the gaming
community, is Watchdogs,
a game where you can
trigger explosives, control
traffic lights, hack bank
accounts and personal
information, and even
jam cellphone networks
all through a few taps on
a smartphone. This may
seem thrilling, dramatic,
or even ‘awesome’ at
times in context of the
series, video game, or
movie, but it is, in actuali-
ty, a very serious concern.
With data being the
world’s most valuable
resource, it’s no surprise
that there has been a huge
surge in the number of
cyber attacks all around
the world over the past
decade. Even the new
Disney+ service, which
These examples show
how even the biggest of
companies are susceptible
to malicious attacks and
why cyber security plays
a critical role as we head
into the future.
In the past year, you
might have noticed a lot
of companies place an
increased emphasis on
the privacy and security
of their users’ personal
data. From Apple intro-
ducing its secure “Sign
in with Apple” feature
to Facebook announcing
“The Future is Private” at
its annual F8 conference
in May, it’s clear that
companies are, in some
ways, trying (and often
failing) to protect their
users’ data from theft.
Oftentimes, companies
themselves exploit the
personal data of their
user base to ‘improve’
the customer experience.
A more recent example
of this is Amazon’s ad-
mittance of using human
staff to analyse and
grade short recordings
of users’ interaction with
Alexa, Amazon’s virtual
assistant. These human
generated reports are used
to improve the speech
recognition and natural
language processing
capabilities of Alexa as a
platform. Amazon claims
that the recordings cannot
be traced back to the user
and that there are strict
measures in place to
safeguard privacy, but it’s
still eerie and unsettling
to know deep down that
someone somewhere is
listening in on you.
On a much larger scale,
more than people, gov-
ernments possess highly
sensitive, classified infor-
mation and have to ensure
that their facilities follow
strict security protocols to
avoid being tapped into
by the wrong people. This
brings cyber-warfare, or
large scale digital attacks
between different nations,
into the story. With coun-
tries around the world
accumulating a massive
amount of intelligence
on each other, it’s only
a matter of time before
one of them uses it for
economic benefit through
means of hacking or
blackmail.
In addition, if these
attacks are used to disrupt
military activities or to
accumulate strategic in-
formation on a country’s
assets or plans, then it
could prove fatal when
used in physical warfare.
Thus, to protect civilians
and to ensure peace,
governments around
the world have taken
several cautious security
measures to safeguard
their confidential infor-
mation.
One such measure was
U.S. President Donald J.
Trump’s move to ban U.S.
based companies from
working with Huawei
through a national
security order. Huawei,
the Chinese telecom giant
and one of the world’s
largest smartphone
manufacturers took a
hefty blow following the
order as it was cut-off
from Google’s android
platform and services
ecosystem. This, in fact,
meant that Huawei was
cut at its knees just when it
reached the top of the tech
market. In effect, the tech
community seemed as if
it lost a valuable player in
the smartphone space.
Huawei caters to all
three groups of the smart-
phone market: high-end or
flagship, mid-range, and
budget (through its sub-
brand Honor). Without
further major software
updates from Google, this
ban effectively affects
consumers in all three
categories. However, the
US government has eased
restrictions, so US-based
businesses are allowed to
continue their operations
with Huawei to abate the
disruption on consumers
using Huawei’s widely
distributed products.
So, where did this all
start? Well, with Facebook
granting it special access
to user data and Vodafone
finding hidden backdoors
in its telecom equipment,
Huawei has been contro-
versial figure with regards
to its security and privacy
measures. In addition, the
CIA’s claim that Huawei
is funded by Chinese
“Data is the
world’s most
valuable
resource”
launched under a week
ago, saw its user base
hacked within a few days
of launch. Furthermore,
in 2011, Sony’s playsta-
tion network was hacked,
and the personal data (in-
cluding credit card infor-
mation) of more than 77
million users was leaked.
This cost Sony more than
15 million dollars in com-
pensation and legal fees.
