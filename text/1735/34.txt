ith such a
huge focus
on the
s e l l - s i d e
nowadays (both in terms
of career opportunities as
well as industry-related
news), the other part of the
global financial industry,
the buy-side, is oftentimes
Asset Management: A closer look
to fully describe what this
industry entails in just
a couple of words. The
profit that asset manage-
ment firms make arises as
a result of a percentage fee
from the total assets under
its management (also
called AUM - the total
market value of all the
assets that a firm holds).
Is this Wealth 		
Management?
It is also worth men-
tioning the difference
between asset and wealth
management industries –
both are often confused
and are wrongly used in-
terchangeably. Although
the exact definition of
each of those business
units highly depends on
the structure of a specific
financial institution, the
generalpurposeofthefield
of wealth management is
to supply high net worth
individuals (HNWIs) with
the full range of financial
services, ** which could
potentially range from
providing custodian
services to forming the
individual investment
solutions based on their
needs. In other words,
asset management is just
one part of more wider
wealth management
services for HNWIs.
Let’s begin our analysis
with the most widely used
parameter for splitting
the funds in two groups:
whether their assets are
managed on an active or
passive basis.
Active Funds
Active funds are con-
stantly overseen by port-
folio managers and the
allocation of their assets
can vary on a regular
basis according to how
the market conditions
are viewed by the funds’
managers. They can be
further split up in two
other sub-types:
- Open-ended funds:
the number of shares are
unlimited, they are sold
to and redeemed from
investors directly by the
fund manager.
- Close-end funds: there
is a specific number of
“Hedge funds
are a special
type of asset
management
firms
...obtaining
the largely
above-average
returns.”

shares issued in the begin-
ning by a fund manager,
which is unchanged, and
all the shares are sold and
bought only in the market
(not through the issuer).
Passive Funds
Passive funds on the
other hand, just track a
market index or a market
segment (e.g. S&P 500,
FTSE100, MSCI), its
asset allocation does not
vary through time. The
most common form of
a passive fund are the
exchange-traded funds
(ETFs) which represent a
basket of various securi-
ties and trade exactly like
stocks.
To observe the differ-
ences in greater details
please refer to the table
provided in Figure 2.
Generally, passive funds
are more popular in
the periods of bull (i.e.
growing) market, while
passive funds experience
an upturn in the bear (i.e.
falling) market. However,
with the recent large-scale
popularisation of ETFs
this trend could change
in the years to come as
illustrated in Figure 4.
In addition to that,
funds can also be split up
according to asset classes
that they invest in. The
most common types of
assets used include: equity
(i.e. stocks), government
bonds, corporate debt,
commodities and private

ten. Therefore, the aim of
this article is to introduce
the reader to the buy-side
world, specifically to asset
management firms and
hedge funds.
What do they do?
So what do asset
management firms do?
Exactly what the name
suggests: they assist their
clients (which can both be
corporate and individual)
with investing into various
mutual funds (i.e. a col-
lection of different assets)
according to the clients’
needs and goals.* That is
a pretty vague definition,
isn’t it? Well, this directly
follows from the fact that
(as we will see later) the
range of services provided
by different types of asset
management firm varies a
lot, and thus it is difficult Fig 2. A comparison of the active open-ended and close-ended funds and the passive ETFs // CEPS
