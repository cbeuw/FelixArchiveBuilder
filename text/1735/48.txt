Imperial Sailing Cosy up at Oxford Magnum
“maybe
favouring
the pub over
socials is
what leads to
success… ”
L
ast weekend
Imperial Sailing
sent their first
team to Farmoor
Reservoir for the annual,
invite-only Oxford
Magnum. The weekend
really started on the Friday
evening, when most of
the team (*cough* Eve
*cough*) made their way
to the Commodore’s house
for a last-minute R&T
(Raclette and Theory)
sesh. After two hours of
cheesing and gossiping,
the tactics discussion
their different brain func-
tioning, the crews’ eyes
slowly began to close and
called it a night.
At around 8am the fol-
lowing morning, everyone
piled into cars and drove
to Oxford, with an oblig-
atory Maccies midway
stop. Upon arriving at
the reservoir, the wind
was fairly light but nev-
ertheless, racing started,
and the day progressed
well, despite the cold and
torrential rain. Although
every race was lost that
day, the team learned
from the mistakes made
and was not discouraged.
The initial plan for ac-
commodation was to split
the team up in different
Oxford College floors.
Everyone was quite disap-
pointed by this cruel sep-
aration, when a solution
arose: Toby’s Grandpa
offered up his lovely
home, only 20 minutes
from the reservoir. This
was by far the most
comfortable of any event:
a warm bed each, comfy
sofas, warm showers and
most of all… Maisie the
adorable black Labrador
that was cuddled and
cooed over all evening.
By 4pm everyone
was starving and made
the decision to ditch the
9pm Curry social for a
delicious pub meal with
Toby’s Grandpa. Feeling
warm and replenished,
our 6 sailors strolled into
M&S to get “shnackzzz”
for the evening’s cosy
screening of Planet Earth
II. David Attenborough’s
soft voice slowly made
eyes close and everyone
went to sleep in their large
comfy beds. For some
tired third years, this
wholesome evening beats
the usual Curry-Club-Car-
pet any day!
Refreshed and revived
by a full night’s sleep,
after Anita’s heart-break-
ing goodbyes with Maisie,
the team headed to the
reservoir for a second day
of racing. Because of an
interesting performance
the previous day, Imperial
Blue was placed in Bronze
Fleet. Sailing under the
sun, morals high as ever,
5 out of 6 races were won
and overall, Imperial Blue
came 10th in the event
and 2nd in Bronze fleet,
improving on last year’s
results.
Who knows, maybe
this is a new phase for
Blues – maybe favouring
the pub over socials is
what leads to success…
Or will the appeal of
Cardiff SU’s VK bar be
too strong to resist… stay
tuned for news from next
weekend’s trip!
Special thanks to Toby
for driving us everywhere,
and many thanks to Uni-
versity of Oxford Sailing
Club for organising such
a well-run event! Thank
you also to Rooster
Sailing for providing us
with sailing kit during
the year – we’re eagerly
awaiting our latest order!
