Thank you all for your submissions last week! This week’s theme is focusing around Valve and Steam. With a New
Half-Life game just announced!?!?!? There has never been a better time. We look back at the greatest PC games

Poll Results: Sonic Poll
Question 3: What would be the best Sonic game to remake:
This week we recieved a very strong opinion that I would love to feature:
Sonic has been wholeheartedly shit since Sega went 3rd party. I quaff at those who try to claim it’s just in a rough patch. They have about as much clarity of mind as I
did when I fed a ﬂock of seagulls dulcolax. We should bury our past and move on, fuck that tiny blue hedgehog and the years of disappointment he’s put me through.
Some calmer answers:
Sonic Heroes (a personal favourite for the gamecube)
Sonic and the Secret Rings (That theme tune still gives me chills)
Sonic Riders (A games I can’t vouch for but I have only heard good things about this classic racing game)
FELIX
