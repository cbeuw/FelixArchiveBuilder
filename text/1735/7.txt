A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
For example, a stance on a
student protest occurring
in 2015 would be voted
on, and that stance would
become official Union
policy for three years,
long beyond its relevance.
To fix that, we’re trying
to change the way it
works. We have an action
tracker at Council, which
is a record of specific
actions that need to be
taken – a description of
the action, the person
responsible, and a date
by which it needs to have
been completed or by
which an update needs to
be prepared.
Then stances which
have a long-term rele-
vance, such as our stance
that the College should not
levy academic sanctions
to enforce the payment of
non-academic debt – like
halls rent. We’re strongly
against that, and it’s a
standing policy of the
Union, and should be a
long-term policy.
With regards to them
all currently being
lapsed – we’re fixing
that too. Predominantly
the Council Chair, Lloyd
James, alongside the
OTs and other members
of staff, have done a big
piece of work on looking
at those old policies.
We’ve scrapped old ones
that were no longer timely,
merged several policies
with similar remits,
and then renewed those
temporarily for one year.
We’ve then adapted the
system to give more power
to the various subcommit-
tees of Council, so that
they own certain policies
where that policy falls
under their specific remit
rather than them all being
held by Union Council.
The subcommittees rep-
resent a broader and more
relevant cross-section of
our student volunteers.
Felix: Odd segue, but
– there have been
many health and
safety complaints at
the Union recently,
and there has been a
change in the health
and safety commit-
tee in the Union. Can
you shed any light?
AS: We’ve had a Health
and Safety Committee for
many years, but now it’s
been ‘promoted’ in the
organisational chart; it’s
being given a higher level
of seniority to reflect the
importance of health and
safety as an issue within
the Union. It is chaired
by one of the external
members of the Board of
Trustees, Graham, and has
student representatives as
well as the Deputy Presi-
dents of Education as well
as Finance and Services
on it too. Various staff
members have respon-
sibilities for health and
safety around the Union,
and they attend meetings
with the committee to
report in and be held ac-
countable.
Felix: Was this
change instigated
by the various com-
plaints about health
and safety recently?
AS: Actually, I believe
it predates some of those
more recent escalating
problems – we just
thought it was very
important. It no longer
reports into Finance and
Risk, because it isn’t just
about a list of risks, and
is now established on an
equivalent level.
Felix: How are the
health and safety
issues being ad-
dressed?
AS: We as the Leader-
ship Team realised that we
need more staff support to
address health and safety
issues in the Union. At the
moment it is split between
many people – operation-
al staff like bar managers
and such, in various ways
– and we need at least one
person for whom it is their
full-time job and specific
remit. That is what will
help bring food back to
568, for example.
See this week’s News
about the closure of food
service in 568.
Felix: I want to briefly
touch on the food
service situation in
h-bar, given that
568 currently is not
offering food either
– what’s happening
with that?
AS: It’s been gone for
a while now – we gave a
big update about this via
Felix a few weeks ago.
The Deputy President
(Finance and Services)
and I are working with
various people in the
Union and College, such
as the Head of Catering, to
further discussions about
bringing food back to
h-bar within the timescale
of weeks – rather than it
being a really long time.
Whether that will be a
full menu or a limited
service will depend on
what services the College
is able to put behind this.
We know how big an issue
this is, and it’s a priority
for us to try to fix it.
Felix: Let’s talk about
a couple of the big
projects you’ve been
working on, rather
than day-to-day fire-
fighting! So, you’ve
submitted an ethical
investment paper to
the College Council?
For reference, College
Council is the governing
and executive body of the
university, composited
of external members,
deans of faculties, senior
College management,
and Abhijay as a student
representative.
AS: Yes! There is a
campaign at Imperial
called ‘Divest Imperial’,
whose goal is to get the
university to take its
money out of fossil fuels.
They successfully passed
papers at the Union
Council in 2014 and 2017
that made it our policy not
to invest in fossil fuels
with our limited invest-
ment portfolio. At that
time we surveyed students
about what they felt we
should or should not be
putting our money into –
and the results came back
saying that we should
not invest into things
like tobacco, the arms
industry, fossil fuels, or
amusingly even pornogra-
phy! The Union was also
mandated to campaign to
get the College to divest
from fossil fuels. Previous
Union Presidents since
then have hit a brick
wall trying to make that
happen, and I don’t think
it has been a priority for
them.
More holistically, fossil
fuels are not the sole
matter over which you can
have a debate here. There
are other types of invest-
ments too. For example,
the College is not meant to
be invested in tobacco due
to their relationship with
the Wellcome Trust. I ran
for this role on a platform
on ending unethical
investments generally,
and I think it’s important
the College considers the
ethical ramifications of
where it keeps its money.
It’s important for publicly
funded forward-looking
scientific institutions
to think about that kind
of thing when it makes
decisions. I have therefore
written a paper for College
Council with support
from Fifi, the DPFS, and
Francesca, the Ethics and
Environment Officer,
which suggests taking the
first step – getting student
and staff representatives,
experts, and the senior
staff responsible for
the College’s financial
decisions together to talk
about these issues. We’re
not demanding from the
get-go that the College
doesn’t invest in certain
companies or some such,
but we want to agree on
a set of principles. There
will be disagreement, but
I believe College Council
will agree to create that
group and we will be due
to report back early next
year. We will get the infor-
mation from the experts,
and make an informed
decision that way.
Felix: The College
have regularly de-
fended their position
by stating that they
believe they need to
work with fossil fuel
companies – have
you come up with an
argument you think
will convince them?
AS: No.And this is why
I am not taking a paper that
says “you must take your
money out of fossil fuel
companies”. I’m taking a
paper that says “let’s talk
about ethical investment”.
If you open a discussion
with the former, about
that specific issue, the
door gets closed in your
face and you don’t get any
traction. It stops any dis-
cussion of other changes
that could be made to the
investment portfolio. And
it makes people both in
Divest and in the College
angry and frustrated. I’m
trying to create a forum
where we can discuss the
issues in a constructive
fashion, where the door
is open and we can begin
talking about what the
social responsibility of
the university is when it
comes to its investment
portfolio.
The College Council
meeting at which this
paper will be presented is
on the date of publication,
Friday the 22nd
.
Felix: A related
discussion is to do
with the upcoming
planned climate
strikes – what do you
know about that?
AS: So this is an
initiative organised by
the staff trade union,
the UCU, following the
action they took in Sep-
tember before the start of
term. They’re staging a
lunchtime protest on the
Queen’s Lawn at 12.30 on
November 29th. If this is
an issue any student feels
passionate about, I would
encourage them to go and
lend support.
Felix: At some point,
do you see the Union
supporting student
strikes or lecture
walkouts over cli-
mate or sustainabili-
ty issues?
AS: It’s an interesting
topic for debate. I don’t
want to speak for the
Union generally, but if
someone brought a paper
to Union Council about
it I would personally
probably support it – de-
pending on the specific or
exact content in the paper.
It’s an important issue
and our generation are the
ones who will really start
feeling it.
Felix: Regarding
your other project,
there has been big
news this week about
rent renegotiations,
which we discussed
last time we spoke.
There is an event that
went up on Thurs-
day night about a
meeting about rent
issues? What’s hap-
pening currently?
The Union and College
periodically have nego-
tiations about the price
of rent in halls. This one
has come about in time
with the development
of new halls in Acton,
which roughly doubles
the number of bedspaces
out there, along with
other changes to the rent
portfolio. Historically,
when these negotiations
come up, the DPW and
Union President take the
different options to the
Union Council.
The Council meetings
are public, and we think
students will really care
about this issue. We’ll be
holding that meeting in
the Read Lecture Theatre
at 7 PM on the 3rd
of
December, and talking
about this and inviting
presentations from any
student who wants to have
their voice heard.
