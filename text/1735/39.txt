Social Mobility: A Pipe Dream for Disadvantaged
Students in 2019?
W
e have
witnessed
no improve-
ment in
social mobility since 2015
in Britain at all life stages
starting from birth. Babies
born from disadvantaged
families grow up facing
the additional task of
overcoming numerous
barriers just to get a shot
at opportunities freely
available to the rest of
society. This is the sombre
truth published in a report
by the Social Mobility
Commission (State of the
Nation 2018-19: Social
Mobility in Great Britain).
Today, education is
one of the biggest factors
determining the trajectory
of the rest of our lives.
A good foundation is the
starting point for access
to higher education, a
specialist technical job, or
an apprenticeship to earn
a stable livelihood. But
for a disadvantaged child
contending with societal,
financial, and geograph-
ical barriers, gaining
this foundation alone is
already a feat in itself.
And it shows.
According to the
report, 43% of five-year-
olds eligible for free
school meals (FSM) did
not achieve a good level
of development in 2018
(as measured by the
early years foundation
stage profile assessment
framework). This figure
is almost twice as much
as non-FSM-eligible
students at 26%. A 2018
study by the Education
Policy Institute (EPI) dis-
covered that persistently
disadvantaged pupils
– those who qualified for
FSM for over 80% of
their schooling time – are
22.6 months behind their
peers when they finish
their GCSEs. By the end
of secondary school, dis-
advantaged students were
on average 18.1 months
behind their peers in 2018,
increasing from 17.9
months in 2017. Youths
without good GCSE
results are 27 times more
likely to be unemployed.
Going into higher edu-
cation is just yet another
hurdle. While more
students from low income
families are now entering
university by age 19, only
5% of students eligible for
FSM are accepted to the
most selective universities
as compared to 12% of
all students. Even then,
financial and cultural
barriers mean that these
students are more likely to
drop out of university.
“Educational inequality
on this scale is bad for
both social mobility and
economic productivity,”
says David Laws, execu-
tive chairman of the EPI
and a former coalition
government schools
minister. Rosamund
McNeil,Assistant General
Secretary of the National
Education Union, shares
this sentiment in her
call-to-action: “The
Government must commit
to proactively reducing
child poverty and commit
to ending it. They must
also provide what schools
need to make education
accessible… Schools
can be the place where
students gain a sense of
optimism and agency
about their futures, but
we’re not giving schools
what they need to make
this difference.”
So, what ARE we
doing? What can YOU, as
a British citizen, do to help
bridge this unacceptable
societal gap? Well, bright
and promising Imperial
College student, you are
now at a prime position to
make a change.
Students can gain a
Post Graduate Certificate
of Education (PGCE) and
Qualified Teaching Status
(QTS) after an undergrad-
uate degree in any subject
studied either in the degree
or at A Levels. Become
a teacher and make the
best use of your intellect
and heart for others to
help make a positive
impact in the lives of the
over 4.1 million children
across the country living
in poverty. Due to a
nation-wide shortage of
teachers, trainee teachers
in STEM disciplines are
eligible for some of the
highest first-year gov-
ernment bursaries of up
to £32,000. Overall, less
than half of the physics
teachers in the UK possess
a relevant degree, with
figures dropping to as low
as 17% in poorer areas.
