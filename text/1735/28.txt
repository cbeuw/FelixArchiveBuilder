Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Review - The
“On my 22-
hour journey
through the
Galar region, I
was constantly
smiling from
ear to ear.”
R
ight, listen
up every-
one. You’re
all wrong.
Pokémon Sword and
Shield are amazing, the
hate for it is, for the most
part, unfounded, and
here’s why.
First of all, a quick dis-
claimer: this is a review
of Pokémon Sword
and Shield. I have fully
completed Shield and am
working my way through
Sword (although the dif-
ferences are minor). This
is a spoiler free review
but if you want to play the
game knowing absolutely
nothing about it, I would
return to this review after
the fact.
On my 22-hour journey
through the Galar region,
I was constantly smiling
from ear to ear at the
beautiful game that truly
brings Pokémon into a
new generation. It was
a struggle to put down
my Switch when around
every corner was a new,
brilliantly designed,
unique Pokémon. I have
played every mainline
game in the series and
haven’t felt this sense of
joy since Diamond and
Pearl. Every game in the
series makes changes, big
and small, but never has a
game made me think “this
is the new gold-standard
of Pokémon”.
The Good
The first thing I noticed
when I jumped into the
game was the sheer scope
of the visuals. Many
people have hated on the
low-res texture (espe-
cially the trees), which
are there, but it is barely
noticeable when you
are gazing over grassy,
rolling fields or sneaking
through mystical, glowing
mazes in the forest.
Sword and Shield are a
breath of fresh air for the
series, introducing the
first fully 3-D world with
a controllable camera in
parts and aspects of free
roam. Unfortunately,
the controllable camera
is only available in the
“Wild Area”, a zone in the
game available before the
first gym where you can
explore a massive area
full of various Pokémon
ranging from level 10 to
50+. It is a great addition
to the typical formula
where you can grind up
as much as you want,
meaning you’ll never hit
a roadblock throughout
the story. The best thing
about the wild area is the
variable weather. The wild
area is split into separate
zones that each can have
their own unique weather
ranging from a sandstorm
to snow, which affects the
Pokémon you’ll encoun-
ter. This is great for fans
of only a single type; I, for
one, love ice types, so the
ability to catch multiple
ice types in the early game
is a wonderful opportunity
I rarely get.
Following the pattern
of generation 6 and
7, a brand-new battle
mechanic has been added.
Dynamaxing (and its
very similar counterpart
‘Gigantamaxing’) is an
option available during
major battles in the game
that allows you to make
your Pokémon grow to a
massive size, increasing
its stats and changing its
moves to significantly
more powerful versions.
Gigantamaxing also does
this but changes the form
of certain Pokémon, such
as Pikachu, that becomes
an absolute chonk (rem-
iniscent of the original
design back in 1996).
This lasts 3 turns and
adds a new dimension to
battling, as you have to
manage whether you are
going to Dynamax early
on to get an advantage,
or Dynamax at the same
time as your opponent
to effectively neutralise
their advantage from Dy-
namaxing. Dynamaxing
also features heavily in
the wild area, with certain
spots throughout shooting
pillars of red light to the
sky. You can go up to
these ‘wells’ and fight a
Dynamaxed Pokémon
which, if caught, will be
a great addition to your
team (as they generally
have much higher stats).
Long term fans of the
series will be pleased
to know that the new
Pokémon are fantastic.
The unique designs bring
back the philosophy of
the earliest games, with a
huge variety of creatures,
any of which you’d love
to have as a pet in real
life! (No key rings or
literal piles of trash this
time). Gamefreak, the de-
veloper of Pokémon, has
done a great job this time
round of not revealing too
much before the game’s
release. I was surprised
by new Pokémon around
every corner, including
Galarian forms that not
only put a new spin on
previous ‘mons, but also
give some of them brand-
new evolutions, such as
Obstagoon – the tantalis-
ingly terrifying evolution
to Galarian Linoone. With
Sword and Shield keeping
the trend of no HMs in
the game, you are free to
build your team however
you like – a task that is
extremely difficult with
nearly 100 new ‘mons and
hundreds more returning.
After the omnisham-
bles that was Alola, we
finally see the return of
gyms! And what a return
to form. The puzzles
before the main fight are
original and the fights
themselves are breath-tak-
ing. The Galar region is
heavily inspired by the
U.K. and in true British
form the gyms are effec-
tively football stadiums.
Seeing the roaring crowd
cheer me on as I, fully
kitted out in sports gear,
make the finishing blow
from across the field was
a whole new level of
immersion I have never
experienced in a Pokémon
game before. Not only the
Pokémon, but the gym
leaders too have amazing
designs – each character
emanates the love for their
specialised type without
saying a word.
Music
One of my favourite
aspects of Sword and
Shield is the music and
art. Each town has its own
tune – both new songs
feature as well as remixes
of older ones that hit that
nostalgia nail right on the
head while still keeping
the general theme of the
game intact. The art in
the games is beautiful.
Being based off the U.K.,
there are many areas
which reference different
cities and areas within the
U.K. Grand castles, clock
towers, charming little
hamlets, and farm towns
give the world a huge
variety of scenery whilst
still keeping under a
unified theme which in the
past has not been executed
as well. (I’m looking at
you Alola, you can’t just
put 4 islands next to each
other and call it Hawaii).
The‘Bad’
This section is three-
fold. I will cover what
actually missed the mark
in this game but also cover
what people, who haven’t
even played the game,
think is bad and give my
two cents on why they
aren’t as big of an issue as
you may think.
