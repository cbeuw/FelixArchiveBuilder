The King (2019)
I
would like to pref-
ace this by saying
that under usual
circumstances, this
is probably not a film
I would be inclined to
watch, however, as a
result of my undying
love for Robert Pattinson,
I have been somewhat
anticipating the release of
The King since watching
its trailer. And whilst my
love for Robert remains
strong, I think I was cor-
rect in presuming that this
type of film isn’t really my
cup of tea. Though don’t
get confused into thinking
I am saying this is a bad
film, it isn’t – at the worst,
it is average, and in some
aspects, rather good.
The film follows “Hal”
(Timothée Chalamet), son
of King Henry IV, and his
sudden ascension to the
throne to become King
Henry V of England.
Intent on having a much
less violent reign than
his father, Hal starts out
gentle, but after some
pushing from his closest
advisors, he is forced to
declare war on France.
Based on multiple plays
in Shakespeare’s Henriad,
the film isn’t historically
accurate, which was
obvious enough when
watching it.
Personally, I found the
half-hearted Shakespear-
ean language jarring, and
the script, which was
slightly lacking, didn’t
make up for it. I thought
the development and
coming-of-age of Hal
could have been fleshed
out more, but instead we
saw him go from the 15th
century’s version of a
party boy to a war-waging
king almost at the flick
of a switch. Nonetheless,
Chalamet’s acting was
definitely the strong point
of this film. Timothée
has proved that he is an
incredibly skilled actor
before now and he doesn’t
fail to showcase this
and domineering, even
when he isn’t speaking.
Whether that is due to his
good looks or transfixing
stare, I don’t know. But
Chalamet’s acting isn’t
the only one worthy or
praise: Pattinson’s ap-
pearance as the Dauphin
of France, although brief,
added to the film, even if
it was simply through a
bit of comic relief with his
laughable French accent
and some well executed
lines. But more impor-
tantly, Joel Edgerton’s
character Falstaff, Hal’s
closest friend, was done
perfectly, with Edgerton
simply melting into the
role.
The King started off
slow and, in my opinion,
was a bit too long, but
the last 40 minutes or
so, containing a gripping
sequence of the Battle of
Agincourt, proved rather
enjoyable. If I was to
watch a Netflix original,
which The King is, a
little over a year ago, I
undoubtedly would have
entered the film with low
expectations (justified or
not). But since watching
Roma – a fantastic Os-
car-nominated Netflix
release of last year, I have
gained more confidence
in Netflix as a production
company and believed
this film had the potential
to be decent, which it is. If
you enjoy medieval films,
this is definitely worth a
watch, but if you’re like
me and like your films
to have some chunky
character development, I
doubt you’d be singing its
praises.
Big Fish (2003)
S
earching for a
heart-warming
film to watch
on a November
evening in an attempt to
combat mid-term blues,
I came across Big Fish,
a childhood classic. I
did remember it was
entertaining and uplifting,
but having seen it such a
while ago, I had forgotten
some twists and details of
the storyline. I checked
if it has stood the test
of time – and I was not
disappointed.
Set in two different
timelines, the film tells a
story of Will who reunites
with his terminally ill
father, Edward, and has
one last chance to hear
what the real story of his
early days was. Blinded
for so many years by
surreal tales, Will is des-
perate to prove that his
father made them up and
in fact lived an ordinary
life.
Edward’s stories are
indeed bizarre, in true
Tim Burton style – it is
a weird gallery of giants,
witches, circus artists,
presented with a good
deal of slapstick humour
(which my 8-year-old
self probably found more
hilarious). That said, one
could expect something
explicitly darker from the
director of Corpse Bride
and Sweeney Todd, while
this is (for the most part)
a sweet, feel-good film.
Its seriousness, however,
is hidden in plain sight.
After all, Big Fish
tackles resolving a family
conflict at the end of life
and contains some very
poignant scenes. Will,
once convinced his father
is nothing more than an
egocentric mythomaniac,
gradually discovers
that when real life gets
daunting, these extraor-
dinary tales are what let
you escape. They are also
what is left once you are
gone.
What I forgot since I
last watched it, is the fact
that young Edward Bloom
is portrayed by Ewan
McGregor, and that he
is by far one of the most
likeable and admirable
characters you will ever
see on the screen. From
the supporting line-up
of Hollywood stars,
Steve Buscemi’s role as
a frustrated poet is the
most absurd – it goes well
beyond a stereotypical
fairy tale character.
If you need an extra
push to get you through
to Christmas or just an
excuse for a study break,
watch Big Fish. 15 years
after its release in the
UK it is as touching and
peculiar as ever.
