La Clique: a cabaret show
U
n d e r b e l l y ’s
v a u d e v i l l e
cabaret show,
La Clique
has finally returned to
London after ten years of
coasting in Spiegeltents
across UK, now offering
a magnificent, jaw-drop-
ping and titillating
escapade. Bernie Dieter’s
vivifying performance is
somehow both salubrious
and salacious, promising
an unpredictable host of
performances: some that
you watch with wide eyes,
and others through gaps
in your fingers and goose
bumps of awe. Lest be
assured, it is impossible to
look away.
A theatrical seduction,
the wide and unique
variety of acts is a
thrilling watch. Ranging
from sword swallowing,
Cyr wheeling, aerial hair
hanging to Kelly Wolf-
gramm’s rendition of “It
Must Have Been Love”,
La Clique has it all, and
tuned to excellence. It
is a joyous celebration
of difference and oddity,
with absolutely no
doubt of skill. Stunned
and marked by David
Pereira’s unabashedly
flexible performance with
a shopping trolley and
shaving cream or Heather
Holliday emerging as a
feisty dragon as she licks,
eats and breathes fire, La
Clique is the embodiment
of erratic burlesque. Each
act has its own character,
each contributing to the
success of this marvellous
show.
The audience is
encouraged to react and
interact, and what better
way to fully immerse
yourself in the realm of
eccentricity than with a
glass of prosecco or two
Boy, Stephen Williams’s
jaunting aerial perfor-
mance in “It’s a Man’s
World”, it is difficult to
top the act and make a
comeback in part two.
In fact, the show ended
all too soon after that,
and part two remained
unhinged and unmatched
to the spectacle in part
one. Albeit a balance
in the order of acts is
much needed, the set was
beautiful and aesthetic,
lighting: scintillating, live
orchestra: flawless. With
such a merry atmosphere,
it is difficult not to linger
and hope to be part of this
regale for longer.
Cosily located in
the middle of Leicester
Square’s Christmas
market, La Clique is a
wonderfully diverse and
festive break from the
outside world, where you
get a chance to experience
extreme skill and passion
like never before. So,
cut loose, grab a seat and
get comfortable because
“darlings, the world
is too full of shit” and
sometimes a moment of
erudite juggling is just
the moment of respite you
may need.
Leonardo: A journey through Da Vinci’s mind
L
eonardo Da Vinci
was a man ahead
of his time; only
he could bring
his brushstrokes & muted
pencil shading to life. The
exhibition, which opened
in November at the
National Gallery allows
the public to have an
immersive Da Vinci expe-
rience, unveiling hidden
sketch & fingerprints.
Although DaVinci’s talent
as a painter and his ap-
proach to light & shadow
are explored, the main
focus is the painting “The
Virgin of The Rocks”. The
entire Ground Floor of the
Gallery becomes a paint-
ing studio, an imaginary
chapel and a room-sized
experiment in this immer-
sive exhibition that leads
you through Da Vinci’s
mind. The exhibition is
divided into four distinct
spaces, each equally en-
tertaining & educational,
carrying secrets of his
masterpiece, inviting you
to look at the painting in a
different way.
There are two versions
of “Leonardo’s Virgin of
the Rocks” (the version
in the Louvre was painted
first). These two paintings
are a good place to start
to define the qualities of
the new style of the High
Renaissance. Leonardo’s
concern of creating an
illusion of space, Mary
being seated on the
ground (Madonna of
Humility), the fabulous
& mystical landscape
with rivers that seem to
lead nowhere and bizarre
rock formations that recall
the Dolomite mountains
of north-eastern Italy all
make the piece divine.
The painting has been
undergoing significant
scientific investigation,
uncovering the original,
hidden sketches of the
artist as well as mystery
handprints left in the paint.
According to a spokes-
person for the Gallery,
“These new images
were found because the
drawings were made in
a material that contained
some zinc, so it could be
seen in the macro x-ray
fluorescence (MA-XRF)
maps showing where this
chemical element was
present, and also through
new infrared and hyper-
spectral imaging.
“Why Leonardo
abandoned this first com-
position still remains a
mystery.”
Of other discoveries,
he added: “Handprints
resulting from patting
down the priming on the
panel to create an even
layer of more or less
uniform thickness can
also be seen, probably the
work of an assistant - but
perhaps even by Leonardo
himself.”
Dr Gabriele Finaldi,
National Gallery director,
said: “This exhibition rep-
resents a fascinating new
venture for the National
Gallery, combining the
most recent technical
research on The Virgin
Of The Rocks with an
immersive, enveloping
experience, giving
visitors the opportunity
to explore Leonardo da
Vinci’s creative process in
making this masterpiece.”
The show celebrates
Da Vinci’s finest works;
it washes you over with
its provocative & brave
composition, it carries a
certain playfulness that
Leonardo adds in all his
paintings, and it is, in fact,
a true treasure.
