lthough unlike-

solidifies his mastery
of the horror genre by
making everyday birds as
menacing as any Freddie
Kruger or Mike Myers.
On a roll after the suc-
cess of Psycho just three
years earlier, Hitchcock
brings to life Daphne du
Maurier’s short story of
the same name. The story
follows party girl Melanie
Davis, the 60’s more
perceptive answer to Paris
Hilton, as she goes on a
mission to deliver a pair
of love birds for a man
she becomes enthralled
with. In order to get the
birds rightfully delivered,
Melanie follows the man,
Mitchel Brenner, to the
sleepy coastal town of
Bodega Bay, where it be-
comes clear that the birds
are beginning to act eerily
out of character.
A notable characteristic
for the first half is the
picture postcard ready
shots thrown about, tying
in with the mood of the
scenes. With it being a full
hour before the birds start
showing much violent be-
haviour, Hitchcock spends
time effectively painting a
picture of the tranquillity
of the town and building
a cheeky rapport between
our main protagonists.
If your appetite for
horror is only satiated
by constant frights from
the get-go, The Birds is
not for you. However,
the ‘scary scenes’ in this
film creeping in so slowly
means the audience is able
to soak up the hints of
things going awry before
we’re confronted by them,
leading to a more enjoya-
ble payoff. When things
finally do start to go crazy,
the boundaries of reality
are ripped open, with
children being pinned to
the floor and dragged by
their hair.
The Birds was nominat-
ed for its special effects
soon after its release, with
film editors from MGM
and Disney studios being
employed to utilise new
‘yellow screen’ technol-
ogy to overlay some of
the masses of birds over
the cast. Even with this,
I believe that if this film
was made today with
modern day CGI and
robotics, it wouldn’t be
“Hitchcock
makes
everyday birds
as menacing
as any Freddie
Kruger or Mike
Myers”
the special effects that
would make it stand out,
but the sound technology.
This film hasn’t got much
of a soundtrack in the
traditional sense, rather
a carefully composed
symphony of birdsong
that, as the movie
progresses, trains the
audience to fear it. This
is particularly memorable
when real trouble starts to
brew: it’s a dusky evening
and Melanie and Mitchell
are having a dispute while
a crescendo of birdsong
begins. The audience
realises this first, then
Melanie, and then we see
a sinister murder of crows
perched on a nearby tree.
Yikes.
A more unfortunate
reoccurring motif in this
film is that every single
female character seems
pretty much useless at
trying to fight away these
birds. This ridiculousness
reaches its apex when Mrs
Brenner, Mitchell Bren-
ner’s mother, attempts
to shoo away approxi-
mately 300 birds with a
handkerchief. Meanwhile
it seems clear that it is
only the male characters
intent on doing anything
particularly useful, such
as nailing shut windows
and doors and attempting
a plan to lure the birds
away. It is worth consid-
ering that this may be an
unfortunate by-product
of looking back on a film
from the 60s directed
(obviously) by a man,
when the writer of the text
this film is based on is in
fact a woman. It is also
worth mentioning that du
Maurier disapproved of
Hitchcock diverging from
the story in some respects,
for example setting the
film in west California
instead of Cornwall.
Aside from the charac-
teristics that firmly root
film where hundreds of
birds are caged in a bird
shop, we see birds of all
species working together
against the common
enemy: mankind. Much
like how the planet is
currently fighting against
us now with devastating
forest fires and floods, the
audience is warned against
the dangers of exploiting
nature. Alternatively, a
similar argument could be
formed, with du Maurier
portraying the birds as
those being exploited,
who, with their strength
in numbers, can rise over
those oppressing them.
Without taking itself
too seriously, The Birds
manages to show us that
there is a hint of horror in
anything. Despite being
released almost 60 years
ago, this story shows only
small signs of aging. And
again, despite its age, it is
an essential watch for any
fan of horror and like it or
not, you’re not going to
appreciate birdsong for a
while.
