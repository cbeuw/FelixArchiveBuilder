They can take our

take our curly fries!

Food production in 568
ground to a halt last week
as the single microwave
used to make food broke.
Chefs in 568 were in the
middle of their evening
service last Tuesday when
the Third Assistant to
the Sous-Chef (Nachos)
wrenched the door of
the microwave open too
quickly. As this was the
only method the kitchen
had for heating food a
huge tailback of orders
built up as the chefs strug-
gled to fix the microwave.
They managed to get the
power back on but there
was no getting the door
back on.
The solution found was
using the Third Assistant
as a replacement door and
simply trimming off and
deep frying the tumours
that developed. 4 hours
after orders stopped being
filled, a single plate of
curly fries was delivered
but it was too little, too
late, and ravenous stu-
dents stormed the kitchen
chanting “Southern Fried
Chicken Wraps or death”.
The students were not
ready for what greeted
them once they broke
down the kitchen door.
Giant rats, the size of
small children, wearing
chef’s hats scattered,
squeezing themselves into
holes in the walls, leaving
the filthy empty kitchen
behind.
Shocked as the stu-
dents were, the joy felt at
tearing down the symbol
of their oppression was
great enough to overcome
any doom and gloom.
Third year IEI student
Feb Senton was among
the crowds. “It was a
historic day. For so long
we students have tried to
peek over the bar at the
world of plenty beyond.
Today, however, the bar
has fallen!”
Furniture was piled
up in a huge bonfire and
students debated long
into the night about how
the kitchen could be run
for the students. Carchie
Coombs distinguished
himself by advocating
a student led model but
there was silence when he
asked for volunteer chefs.
In the end wannabe
student revolutionaries
had to resort to tempting
the kitchen rats back in
and making them pinkie
promise “not to be gross
anymore”. Unfortunately,
there is little sign that
the events of the evening
last week have led to any
change in the culture of
the Union. The freshly
released menu includes
a new item. The Tumour
Mayo Wrap.
