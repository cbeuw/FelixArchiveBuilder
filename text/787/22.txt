KARATE
Hi ho silver
Dawn last Saturday saw twenty of our
enthusiastic if weary-eyed squad
members and supporters boarding a
coach together with Caesar Andrews
(3rd dan) bound for the National
Student Championships at Keele.
Guest celebrities at the event included
Britain's top instructor Andy Sherry
(6th dan) and Frank Brennan British
and European Grand Champion (4th
dan).
Although it was cold and frosty at
six in the morning spirits were still
high after last week's successes at the
Portsmouth Invitation Tournament.
By ten o'clock most of the
participating universities and
polytechnics, nine in a l l , had
assembled and the seventeen teams
were, desperately trying to warm up
in the sub-zero temperatures.
The competition kicked off in more
ways than one with the men's team
kumite. Both of our teams fought well
displaying strong technique and good
spirit. The A team (P Urbana, K
Sayers, A Kerley, 0 Kawaji, R
Newton, S Taylor and O Abbosh)
succeeded in fighting through to win
the bronze trophy only being stopped
by the eventual National Champions,
Wolverhampton.
The squad's next successes were
gained in the ladies' individual
kumite: J Spicer easily taking the
silver and S Lindberg battling through
to collect the bronze. The men's
individual kumite turned out to be
quite a challenge. S Kawaji reached
the quarter finals with very creditable
performances also coming from K
Sayers, P Urbana and J Rogers.
As the remainder of the competition
progressed it became clear that
despite 'extraordinary efforts' in the
kata sections last week's splendid total
of ten trophies was not be be beaten.
Cambridge University, the highest
funded of all the squads, once again
displayed how much they have
benefitted from recent trips abroad
including Japan, by retaining the
National Team Kata Championships.
Tomorrow sees the start of the
British Universities Karate
Championship held at the National
Sports Centre, Crystal Palace. A
predominantly IC team (13 out of 20)
coached by Imperial's instructor
Caesar Andrews will be representing
the whole of London University.
The squad would like to thank
Caesar for his dedication to Shotakan
karate at Imperial.

Sean wins a rubber

Tearing down
The usual collection of IC Badminton
megastars arrived at Nottingham
University on Friday evening to do
battle once more in this annual event.
There was a little more at stake this
year since everyone would have liked
to repeat the triumph our first ladies
pair had last year—they became
ladies' doubles champions!
The first events were the men's and
ladies' singles where a few surprises
were in store, and no one was more
surprised than Sean who won a rubber
to reach the second round. That was
his lot though! Trevor did remarkably
well to win 2 and reach the third
round where he was narrowly beaten
by a county player from Leicester
University. The best performances in
the singles however came from Uta.
She reached the last 16 where she
unfortunately came up against the
number 2 seed from Birmingham.
In the ladies' doubles Julie (half of
the championship pair from last year)
and Uta strode through to the quarter
finals where they met the top seeds,
and eventual winners, from
Loughborough. In the men's doubles
two pairs played through two rounds
each before being defeated. Sean and
Simon had a tremendously narrow
victory over a pair from Liverpool
before being out-manoeuvred by the
top pair from U C I (boasting the
runner-up in the men's singles).
Bhavot and Trevor, on the other hand
had more convincing victories and
managed to reach the last 16 by virtue
of having a bye through to the second
round.
In the mixed doubles everyone lost.
Enough said!!
The weekend was the usual mix of
good badminton, good company,
plenty of nervous tension, and great
fun, and I'm sure everyone enjoyed
themselves. The finals were some of
the best I have ever seen at U A U
(especially the ladies' singles) and it
was particularly nice to see a Brunei
pair win the mixed, rather than the
Loughborough's and Nottingham's of
this world.
MORE RUGBY
Brums Drum RCS
R C S lst X V - 1 2
Birmingham University 4th X V — 2 8
On Wednesday (18th) morning the
RCS Rugby Squad and a set of shirts
gathered in Beit Quad for their annual
fixture in Birmingham.
The coach left late and arrived even
later with just 15 mins before kick off.
Captain Pert and Spock had problems
with their navigational equipment.
The first team started one man
short. Despite dropping the ball on the
line, the captain's boot put us into an
early lead which we retained until
early in the second half. The second
half we played into the wind and lost
HOCKEY
Convincing loss
IC lsts 1
Southgate Adelaide 5
On Saturday, IC lsts played unbeaten
Southgate Adelaide in the Middlesex
league. Adelaide, the home side, were
evidently well prepared for the top-
of-the-league clash and quickly took
the lead from a brilliant short corner
routine. Due to IC's slack hockey and
lack of discipline, the club side scored
a further four goals before the inter-
touch with the 'hackers'. Then out of
the blue midway through the half
Dave Wilson barged his way through
for a well deserved try. This recovery
saw the back row linking with the
backs well in the loose. Notable
performers C Owen, Tubby Wilson,
S Fairhead, Bryn, Boyce and Spock-
'Bardiver'-Dobson. It was in this
period of RCS domination that Spike
Boyce was brought down brutally and
had to leave the field. The game then
just seemed to slip away and before
we knew it they had scored two in the
corner to seal the game.
val. Having lost the game in the first
35 minutes, IC started afresh in the
second. Despite coming out 1-0 win-
ners in that period, IC lost the match
convincingly on goal difference. If IC
are to win the honours that they are
capable of this year, they will have
to approach their matches with a
much more professional attitude.
We've had two more outings and both
with good turnouts I'm pleased to say.
At the London Colleges League in
Battersea Park we had 16 runners
making three full teams (and Jane).
The course was over a flat 10km
course consisting 3 laps of a 2 mile
circuit. The course has previously
been used for the A A A
Championship. Performances of note
came from Bubertus Schulte-Huxel
(22nd) and Mark Ashby (26th).
O u r next race was at the
Whitenights Relays in Reading. W e
again had three teams entered and
with good selection the teams were
fielded according to anticipated
performances. In a very strong field
of 80 teams, and over a fast 2 l
h mile
course around the campus of Reading
University, our first team did well to
show in the top 25 teams with the
second and third teams following
closely behind. Many thanks to our
president Professor Inman for his
support at this and other races this
term. Thanks also to those in the team
who suggested we should have a tour
of Reading after the race. Most
enjoyable!
Finally, I have to mention the
University of L o n d o n
Championships, tomorrow Saturday
December 5. As a result of some
mindless individuals tearing notices
from our board the list of people for
this race was missing for some time
before a new one was made up. If you
still want to run but are not sure if I
have your name then please go to the
noticeboard today for details.
Women
