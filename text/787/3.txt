Con Man
takes
£1000 off
student
This week a student was conned out
of £1000 by a man posing as an A i r
France steward who needed to get
home urgently. Claiming that he
couldn't get the money himself due
to gambling debts and a 24-hour delay
in telexing money, the Frenchman
gave the student fake gold bracelets
and watches, and a false telephone
number as security. This man has
been operating in the Kensington area
since the summer and several Imperial
students have had their savings taken.
Generally he picks on overseas
students, and at a time just before the
banks close. On this occasion he was
driving a Fiat Uno.
A large audience witnessed possibly
the most exciting U G M of this week
on Tuesday in the J C R with lively
debate on several issues by Chairman
Alastair Seymour. The meeting was
opened with the reading of a letter
from Surrey University Students'
Union about the kidnapping of Ian
Howgate (see front page). The papers
still not having arrived the meeting
moved onto an emergency motion on
smoking in the Union Snack Bar
which was passed with an amendment
to allow smoking to continue at the
Lounge Bar. The papers then arrived
and the minutes were passed
unchallenged. A motion which
instructed the Union to oppose the

formation of a postgraduate only hall
in Southside, proposed by Roland
Smith, was opposed by Gillian Cutter
and Chas Jackson who had seconded
an emergency motion to discuss the
site and size of such a hall.
The original motion was passed on
a vote and the Chairman ruled that the
emergency motion need not be
considered.
Debate was begun on a motion
about attacks on Palestinian students
at Bethlehem University, when Dave
Williams proposed a procedural
motion to return to the agenda and
hear the Officers' reports. This was
passed and quorum was successfully
challenged.
Open day
The Royal School of Mines held its
open day on Thursday. Between 200
and 250 people took advantage of this
chance of seeing around the
departments of Geology, Materials
and Mineral Resources Engineering,
and several companies put up displays
showing the sorts of jobs graduates
in these fields might expect.
Dr Flower from the Department of
Materials, one of the organisers, said
that although the number of people
attending was lower than expected, he
considered the event a success in
terms of the interest shown. He was
also pleased with the number of firms
j who took part in the exhibition. The
industrialists themselves, despite the
freezing cold in the exhibition
marquee, were impressed by the
effort put in by R S M students to make
the event run well. It was also a good
opportunity for students to meet
potential employers.
Most of the people taking tours
round the departments, guided by
students, were sixth formers, a
reassuringly large proportion of these
were girls. Representatives of a
couple of trade magazines also turned
up. The De L a Beche (Geology)
Society provided coffee, while Chaps
sold burgers. Other highlights of the
displays were the 30 ton truck and 25
ton digger parked outside.

Crushing
Internal Services Officer Alistair
Birch sat on a toddler in Norman's
Snack Bar, it was revealed today. M r
B i r c h who was engaged in
conversation at the time did not notice
that the chair, in which he was about
to sit, was occupied by the baby. M r
Birch, known to both his friends as
Baby Crusher Birch, commented 'it
was a close thing, but I nearly got
him'.
Charcoal
Five fire engines were called to put
out a fire in the Biology Department
last week. Pedestrians in Prince
Consort Road had noticed smoke
coming from a ground floor window
and had alerted the fire brigade.
The fire was caused by a piece of
wood being left in an oven in the
Timber Research Laboratory, it
caused a lot of smoke but little
damage.
Miracle
The 'Jnion Snack Bar passed its health
inspection on Wednesday. To
celebrate its success, they served
ratatouille again.
