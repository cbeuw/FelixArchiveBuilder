In a daring raid at Imperial College on Sunday, ICU President Ian
Howgate was abducted by members of Surrey University Student Union
and taken to a secret location in the heart of Guildford.
Most students only noticed their
President's absence when he failed to
attend the U G M on Tuesday, where
his report was referred back until he
money raised above £100 will be
equally split between Surrey Rag and
IC Rag.
On Wednesday, I C U Deputy
could present it in person. A letter
from Surrey University Union to the
U G M described their terms: £100 to
cut Ian's hair; £200 to shave his legs
and arms; £300 to shave the rest of
his head; and £500 to remove all the
h?ir from his body. The first £100
was guaranteed by I C U and any
President Alan Rose and Honorary
Secretary Chas Jackson drove down
to Surrey to investigate the position.
They discovered that Ian had been
continuing his Presidential work using
Surrey Union's telephones. They
reported that he seemed quite happy,
having been plied with drink and 'kept
in a luxurious manner to which he
was totally unaccustomed'.
Whilst i n the area, the two
sabbaticals decided to kidnap Surrey
Vice President Dave Watson. The
reasons for this action are, however,
unclear. Alan Rose first said that they
did it to secure Ian's release and then
he said it was to make sure that they
kept him.
At 3 o'clock on Wednesday M r
Howgate was taken to a student
house, tied to a chair and given a
severe haircut by a photographer from
their Union newspaper Bare Facts,
who described M r Howgate's
appearance as 'rather remarkable'.
He was later swapped for Dave
Watson at the Three Kings pub in
West Kensington but will return to
Surrey if enough money is raised to
give him a further haircut.
Ian told F E L I X that Surrey was 'a
really nice place' and that nobody had
tortured him. A representative from
Surrey said that they had captured Ian
because 'it seemed like a good idea
at the time'. Chas Jackson said later
.that the whole point of the stunt was
to improve relations between Surrey
and IC after members of several IC
sports clubs behaved badly in the
Surrey Union Bar. He felt that the
stent had been incredibly successful.
Donations to the Ian Howgate fund
should be made in the Union Office
before Sunday.
