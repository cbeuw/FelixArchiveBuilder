Ibiza is a really nice place if you can
find a spot unpopulated with Brits in
their coffee-coloured shorts and socks
and sandals. Yuk! Unfortunately the
Spaniards are so chuffed that
Barcelona has been chosen to host the
1992 Olympics, they have decided to
have five years of celebrations leading
up to them! This summer saw the first
Just Another University for an hour.
I saw the preview last week and there
are classic shots of IC, the Rector, the
Departments, etc, as Laurie Taylor
does his bit for his old university.
Would you believe it, but the only bit
of student activities they show apart
from working in the lab is F E L K ! It's
true. In one hour they devote maybe
five minutes to students outside of the
lecture theatres and of those five about
in an annual series of pop concerts
leading to the Games set in Ibiza. The
B B C , in their great wisdom, have
decided to screen highlights of this
event on Saturday (BBC2, 7.35pm)
including Marillion and Freddie
Mercury with Montserrat Caballe. I
just can't wait until 1992!
If you're kind of kinky, The Film
Club (BBC2, Saturday, 10pm) is
showing two films about male
obsession. One is French and sounds
unmissable: 'two women exercise a
form of sexual terrorism' on the
hapless hero! The second is Man of
Rowers which is 'profoundly erotic'?
M m m , sounds interesting.
For those of you following the
hideous Dancing Days (Channel 4 ,
11.30am, Saturday), it's just getting
so exciting! Carlos has finally found
out Julia's true identity and is still
madly in love with her! Watch
tomorrow's episode to find out what
will happen next.
There are some really crass
programmes on Saturday night. I
really pity the masses who look
forward to their T V dinner with Blind
Date (ITV, 7.15pm) and Copy Cats
(ITV, 6.45pm). Don't do it! There is
a programme you must watch on
Channel 4 instead. A t 6.32pm
tomorrow they will be screening Not
three minutes are devoted to F E L I X ,
an interview with last year's Editor
;
David Jones plus lots of shots of the
F E L I X megastars.
Talking of crass programmes
there's Laughs from the Palladium
(LTV, Sunday, 7.15pm). Don't you
just hate Jimmy Tarbuck? This
programme is meant to be highlights
of the comedy they've featured but I
don't thing it's even worth turning on
the set.
What is worth watching is the
glorious Spitting Image ( I T V ,
Sunday, 10.05pm). This is the last in
the current series; shame! Worth ten
times what Laughs from the
Palladium is worth! Spitting Image is
followed by a South Bank Show (TTV,
10.35pm) devoted to Eric Clapton. It
traces his life from his childhood in
Surrey, through to his success with
the sixties pop group the Yardbirds
and supergroup Cream. It features his
years of drug and alcohol addition.
Torrid tales!
Night Network features Jethro Tull
(ITV, Monday, lam) and if you can
bear to stay up all night there's TV
Censored Bloopers (ITV, Monday,
4am) which claims to be hilarious out-
takes from American T V based on
It'll Be Alright on the Night.
