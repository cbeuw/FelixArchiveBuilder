BEFOREYOU TIE UP WITH
ERNST&WHINNEY,
COULDYOU SORTOUT THIS
KNOTTY PROBLEM?
Don't entangle yourself with trying to
unravel the knot, because it's not a puzzle.
What it is, is a metaphor for the kind
of problem we face every day in the busi-
ness world. Complicated, unique and
often messy.
Patient plodders who would sit down
and undo it bit by bit are not what we're
after.
But if you realise the quickest way to
undo the knot is simply to cut straight
through it, then you are.
Because Ernst & Whinney are look-
ing for young men and women who can
think practically, decisively and, above all,
imaginatively.
The kind of person with the brilliance
to spot the glaringly obvious.
At Ernst & Whinney we don't see
ourselves as run-of-the-mill accountants.
Instead, we see our role as helping our
clients to develop their business.
To make money, not just to balance
the books.
If this sounds like the kind of firm you
could cut it at, then contact Michael
Knight on 01-928 2000. Or write to the
address below.
