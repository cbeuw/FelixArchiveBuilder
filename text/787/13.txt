Gentleman
Geoff
Geoff Parsons is
making quite an
impact as President
of RSMU. Dave
Burns reviews
Mines and talks to
Geoff about the
Union.
The 'Time Out' Student Guide this
year gave special mention to the
Royal School of Mines in its write up
of Imperial College. It put forward the
famous image of Hon Porn Night,
drunken mindlessness and all the
other popular misrepresentations of
burly, sexist, racist bigots working
their way through university in an
alcoholic haze.
Anyone who cares to take a look
at the Royal School of Mines in this
new year, would see that this view,
which has been waning in recent
times, is crumbling under the
leadership of Geoff Parsons as the
President of R S M U .
The beginning of this term saw a
revamped Mines union office and a
new pride in the identity and image
of Mines. The change has been a long
time in the offing. For much of the
seventies mining students tended to be
the more mature students, who prided
themselves on a work hard, play hard,
drink hard life style. As the nature of
courses in Mines changed, and the
age of entrant to the College dropped,
less experienced students were trying
to uphold a tradition which they did
not have the ability to carry off.
The Royal School of Mines Union
had always been fiercely independent,
a closed social group which could not
be swallowed up by the rest of
College. The change in nature of
Mining students, meant that R S M U
was slowly being overwhelmed. With
less organisation and committment
among students the 'Mines' identity
was being lost.
W h e n Ian Howgate became
Geology Department Representative,
he began to highlight the fact the
Mines image should be changing.
While Ian moved on to I C U , Geoff
Parsons has exploded onto the scene
in Mines and taken a completely new
approach to the problem.
Upon meeting Geoff Parsons you
are immediately struck by his strong
character. He is calm, business like
and very organised. You are greeted
with courtesy, invited to chat with
him in the office and politely helped
with any questions. In short Geoff is
a real gentleman. I caught up with him
after a Mines U G M and talked about
the new direction R S M U is taking.
Geoff stands out from the crowd..
The majority of the credit for the
complete renewal of the Mines Office
goes to Geoff. His years on the
athletics circuit—he is the British high
jump record holder—have given him
many contacts within business, and
the confidence to deal with them.
He's reluctant to discuss precisely
where all the finance for the office
comes from. It is likely that the
companies concerned were loathe to
reveal their involvement to
competitors,' or, it has been
speculated, they may have
involvement in South Africa which
the Union could find embarrassing.
Geoff is righdy proud of the office.
T like to think I could bring the
Chairman of ICI in here without
worrying he is coming into a beer-
drenched hole which smells of puke.'
The office itself could easily be any
executive office, plush carpeted, large
chairs, and all the paraphernalia of
wealth. It is immaculately clean and
w e l l organised. M u c h of the
paperwork from years past has been
thrown out, and only relevant material
remains. A s we sat and chatted, the
place was busy with Union activity.
It is firmly established as a place
where the business of R S M U goes on.
Socialising is left to the bar and the
coffee room. Geoff feels the office has
promoted 'self-pride in Mines' and in
time the students will reap the full
benefits. While jobs in the mining
industry in this country become
increasingly hard to come by,
contacts with industry can only help
in the long term.
The Mines U G M I attended was the
best behaved and organised C C U
meeting I have seen. Geoff seems to
command attention and respect from
within the Union, as do all the
executive . The Union structure has
been reinforced and apparendy all the
reps who are supposed to attend do
so. Events are well publicised and
attended.
Geoff is clearly not accomplishing
everything himself, but he is
demonstrating the sort of leadership
and guiding influence which the other
C C U s could do with.
The new image of the Union has
also promoted a good staff-student
relationship. The Dean and Heads of
Departments were all present at an
evening to open the new office, and
staff members were much in evidence
at the freshers' dinner.
R S M U may still be the smallest
C C U in the College, but right now it
is presenting the best face of any, and
its President is head and shoulders
above the rest. The new approach
within Mines is one which Geoff
thinks I C U could well do with. It
certainly appears to be doing wonders
for R S M U .
