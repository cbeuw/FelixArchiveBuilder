THE FIFTH COLUMN
Aesthetic Design
Design is more
than the creation of
a functional device;
it is as equally
concerned with the
aesthetic appeal of
the final product.
This is the belief of
Mr Paul Ewing,
coordinator of the
Industrial Design
Engineering course
run jointly by the
Mechanical
Engineering
Department at
Imperial College
and the Department
of Industrial Design
at the Royal
College of Art. The
two-year course
(for engineering
graduates) was set
up in 1980, with
the aim of
'combining the
function and logic
of engineering with
the imagination and
beauty of design'.
—Looking good?
Much of the original funding was
provided by the Royal Commission
for the 1851 Exhibition, and most of
the students are themselves supported
by the Science and Engineering
Research Council.
In their first year, the students are
encouraged to develop their
appreciation of such things as colour,
form and texture and also their ability
to communicate through sketches and
models. After the cultural desert of
traditional engineering course, as M r
Ewing put it, 'It brings out the
creativity that was there from primary
school—like taking the lid off the
box'. But everything is kept in
perspective with courses on
production, materials and business
studies.
The second year is spent on a major
design project, the results of last
year's work being exhibited recently
in the Mechanical Engineering Foyer.
Each student chooses his own project,
the emphasis being on a balance of
engineering and industrial design.
The student is then responsible for the
whole spectrum of design from
original concept, to testing and
through to manufacture.
Projects on display included:
•Stairlift for disabled people—with
fold down arms for easy access.
• Saucemaker—with ' innovative
vibratory mixing system'.
• Enclosed motorcyle—perhaps a
little noisy for the rider.
• Portable wind energy
converter—at 23kg and a fold-down
size of 1.5m, a little cumbersome.
But to find fault with those projects
is to miss the point, M r Ewing
believes, as even one of the more
successful designs; the folding bicycle
by Mark Sanders (an IC graduate),
took two years of further development
and funding before reaching
production.
Judging the success of the course
is not easy. Past projects have gone
on to win national and international
design awards, such as the coveted
Braun Design Prize for a sewing
machine in 1983. Past students have
gone on equally to design
consultancies and industry, with firms
such as Jaguar and G E C actually
sponsoring students on the course.
Notably, one graduate is currently
design manager at Lewmar Marine,
a company whose wares grace both
the Americas Cup and Howard's
Way!
Interest in the course is steadily
growing; this year there were 65
applications for the 15 or so places
and next year M r Ewing expects
around 100. But, while companies
like the concept, they are less
forthcoming with actual participation.
In the future M r Ewing would like
to see aspects of the course integrated
into the standard engineering degree.
But whether or not this will actually
happen remains to be seen.
Letter
from
St. Mary's
I suppose this piece is written for all
those people who toil ceaselessly
behind the scenes to ensure the
success of any large theatrical or
musical event. This weekend I have
been the object of irritation for 60
'artistes'. I know that people who
work behind the scenes have on many
occasions suffered the same, perhaps
worse fate.
Here at St Mary's we are in the
production week of the musical A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way
to the Forum. Since the run is for a
full five days, finishing tonight, the
small amount of equipment hired for
the week arrived that Friday and had
to be fully functional for the dress
rehearsal at 9.30am on Saturday.
After arguing with the assembled
cast for one and a half hours last
Friday to vacate the small area so the
lighting people could gain access to
point and focus the lights, we worked
until 5.30am on Saturday morning.
Up again at 8.30am, we ran into
problems delaying the final run-
through. After being pushed around
for the past two weeks because 'the
cast needed to rehearse on stage' one
expected a little tolerance as the fault
was not ours, but a piece of desk
control cable multicore was found to
be wired incorrectly when returned to
the company.
The impression I received last
weekend was that the stage and
lighting were evil messages in the way
of true artistic development, and that
whatever one strives to perform,
miracles are not quite attainable. So
for all those people who toil all hours
that God sends and who barely, if
ever, gain the true rewards they
deserve, these are the people that
make it all possible and without them
there would be no performance.
Next week at our Recreation Centre
following the musical, from Monday
to Wednesday DramSoc perform
Stags & Hens (???) by Willy Russell
(which I recommend after seeing
rehearsals). Performances start at
7.30pm and tickets are £2. The
address for those interested is 38 to
36 Sussex Gardens (Paddington tube
for Edgware Road). A l l are welcome
so come and see how medical students
really behave—nothing like the
rumours, but much worse.
