Ignorance and

Before the
discovery of
anaesthetics in 1846
surgical operations
were very
dangerous, very
painful and very
much a last resort.
Deaths on the
operating table
were frightenly
common. Lucky
patients could
expect to be
knocked out by a
blow to the head or
with large doses of
hashish or alcohol.
The more
unfortunate were
simply held down
while the surgeon
went about his
bloody business.
Medical science has come a long way
since the nineteenth century; in this
country alone more than three million
operations a year are performed with
relative comfort to the patient.
However this impressive fact tends to
obscure the reality of anaesthesia
research; nobody knows how
anaesthetics work.
That is not to say that many people
have not tried to elucidate how
anaesthetics induce unconsciousness
but leave respiration and blood
circulation relatively unimpaired. The
heart of the mystery is that, as a class
of drugs, anaesthetics are completely
bizarre; xenon gas is an anaesthetic;
so is alfaxalone, a steroid compound;
so is decanol, a long chain alcohol.
What is it about these diverse
chemicals that makes them
anaesthetics? Do they all act at the
same site in the brain or at a number
of different sites?
Many drugs one
action
One unifying feature is that
anaesthetics are all relatively inert and
apolar (or hydrophobic). This latter
fact was demonstrated at the turn of
the century by Hans Meyer and E
Overton in 1900. They found that the
potency of an anaesthetic correlated
closely with its solubility in olive oil!
N o w olive oil is simply a mixture of
lipid molecules (these are just long
chains of water-hating hydrocarbons
with a water-liking group on the end)
and since the membrane (or skin)
covering nerve cells in the brain is
also partially composed of lipids it
seemed an obvious target site. Many
people suggested that anaesthetics
exerted their effect by dissolving in
the lipid portion of the membrane and
somehow shutting off the cell.
It was a very attractive hypothesis.
Nerve membranes are responsible for
both the transmission of electrical
signals along nerve fibres (which are
simply extensions from the cell body)
and for the communication of these
signals between two cells. To be
precise these functions are performed
by a variety of protein molecules
which 'float' in the lipid bilayer of the
membrane (see Fig 1). Proteins are
elegant molecular machines and it was
widely assumed that by dissolving in
the lipid portion of the membrane,
anaesthetics disrupted the lipid
environment of these proteins causing
them to malfunction.
The Meyer-Overton correlation
seemed to provide the answer to the
basic riddle of anaesthetic action.
Lipid bilayers in nerve membranes
exist in a gell or jelly-like state; as
such they provide just the sort of
hydrophobic and flexible site which
could accommodate the different
shapes and sizes of anaesthetic
molecules.
However further support for the
lipid theory was hard to come by. It
was variously proposed that
anaesthetic expanded the membrane,
'fluidised' it or reduced its gel to
liquid-crystalline transition
temperature. These were attempts to
explain how anaesthetics in the
membrane might ultimately inhibit the
protein activity essential to the cell's
proper functioning. In the 1960s,
when artificial membranes were
studied extensively, all these effects
were indeed found. But at
concentrations of anaesthetic which
induced unconsciousness they were
tiny, if not neglible.
Putting the lights
out
This was a big problem. Nevertheless
the persuasive power of the Meyer-
Overton correlation was sufficient to
maintain interest in lipid theories of
anaesthetic actionâ€”particularly in the
absence of a plausible alternative. In

Lipid molecules form symmetric, double layer in membranes called the
bilayer. Protein molecules in this jelly-like bilayer are free to float
sideways.
