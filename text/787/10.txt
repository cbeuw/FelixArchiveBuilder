Ian Howgate,
Union President,
now wishes to
become custodian
of correct
behaviour at
College events. He
has inspired close
inspection of codes
of etiquette which
every Imperial
student should
know and observe
at formal dinners.
College for Etiquette
In the outside world, whether rightly
or wrongly, it may be necessary to
know how to behave properly at
formal occasions in order to get on
in life, commented Mr Howgate. He
sees this as being part of all round
education of College students.
So here are a few guidelines for the
next formal dinner:
Dress
Gentlemen —The ticket for the dinner
will usually indicate the type of dress
which is acceptable. 'Black tie' will
require a dinner jacket, black tie,
trousers and shoes. A dark lounge suit
may be also worn at such occasions
although this would usually be
indicated on the ticket. 'Tails' self-
evidently means tails are necessary.
Occasionally at a formal dinner
coloured bow ties may be worn but
they must be dark (sorry Ian, no pink
with yellow dots).
Ladies—A short dress is acceptable
for a 'black tie dinner' although a long
dress will be needed for a 'tails'
dinner. Ladies should never go to a
dinner almost topless, at a dinner
dance a strapless dress may be worn,
but at the meal a stole or shawl must
also be worn.
Before the meal one should stand
behind the chair until grace has been
said (this is more likely to occur in
the outside world than at a College
dinner). If taking a lady, then pull her
chair out and push it back before
sitting down yourself.
At the end of the meal and generally
after the speeches there will be a toast
to the Queen. Between the start of the
meal and the loyal toast you should
not get out of your chair unless
absolutely necessary. Also do not take
off articles of clothing (eg jackets,
ties) or undo top buttons.
Passing the Port
The loyal toast is made with the port
so don't drink it before the toast. The
port is passed clockwise (ie to the left)
around the table. Operate the decanter
with the left hand. If serving the lady
to your left (there is some disucssion
as to whether it is necessary to pour
out a lady's port for her, so this may
not be needed) then serve her first and
pass the port around her back. Ideally
the port should never touch the table,
a glass, or the right hand.
At the end of the meal leave
whenever everyone else starts to
leave, and if taking a lady pull her
chair out for her. If members of the
academic staff are still sitting then
excuse yourself.
