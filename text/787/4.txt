U n i o n
Library access
The facilities, space and staff of the
Lyon Playfair and Haldane Libraries
are, at times, overstretched owing to
heavy usage. We would like to ensure
that these services first and foremost
are being used by the staff and
students of Imperial College. The
only way we can do this is by being
selective about the external users we
admit. The Library is freely available
to all serious readers but we find that
we are being used increasingly by
local tutorial and other private
colleges. As from January 1 1988, we
will be issuing external users with a
Library admission card which they
have to show when entering the
Library. This means that members of
the College may also be requested to
show their Library cards to the
messenger on duty. AH members of
the College are eligible to have a
Library Borrower's card and we
would ask anyone who has not
collected theirs to do so and carry it
when visiting the Library. The
Imperial College Union card will also
be acceptable as a means o f
identification. W e regret any
inconvenience this may cause but we
feel that it will be outweighed by the
improvements in comfort and
security.
Steal a child!
Do you know a child who might like
to race a reindeer, shoot a snowman,
bend a withe, bowl for a duck and
dilly dally on the way? If you do,
H U R R Y ! Today, December 4 is the
last day you, as a member of IC, can
invite guests to the party with a
difference.
The first surprise is that you'll be
played into Sherfield by a musical
wizard to meet a Father Christmas
with empty sacks. He has hopes each
guest will help him by giving
something for him to take to a child
who is a St Mary's Hospital outpatient
from the homeless hotel families in
Paddington and Bayswater. Sister
Richie says that soft toys, picture
books, crayons and mobiles are
particularly loved, but whatever your
guest brings, Father Christmas will
beam with delight.
Everyone is invited to a delicious
tea before the Entertainment begins.
It will be Victorian Music Hall—an
old time parlour entertainment almost
forgotten in today's glitzy world. The
famous Pearly King, Larry Barnes
and his Queen, will lead Cockney
favourites interspersed with juggling,
IC's own Magic Circle, poems, songs
and a mystery production from
DramSoc.
Although the party is designed for
guests from 6 to 14, younger children
may come if you're in charge, but
you'll need to book them in today.
Get your tickets before 5 o'clock from
HUB, Sherfield 355 (ext 3021). £2
each child. Grown ups and under 5's
free. Sorry, but no tickets at the door.
We need to know exactly who is
coming today.
If you are a student or otherwise too
young to have a child on tap or are
elsewhere for the day, how about
sending us a toy for a homeless child?
Drop it into H U B next week or leave
it with Security at the Main Sherfield
desk. Y o u could make a lot of
difference to a lot of 'bed and
breakfast children' who might be in
for a bleak Christmas.

The last Ents
article of '87
Sad to say this is the last Ents article
of 1987 so just let me say I hope you
all enjoyed the gigs so far. O n
Thursday December 10 we have the
last Ents event of term namely a
Comedy Night in the lounge.
Appearing are Felix (nothing to do
with this paper) and witty musician,
impressionist and stand up Johnnie
Immaterial who's just plain funny and
an interesting young lady by the name
of Sea Monster. There should be
some fun and games prepared by the
compere and perhaps a few very
cheap drinks. It all kicks off at 9pm
but try and get there a bit before.
Admission is £1.50 or 50p with an
Ents card. Well there you are, short
but sweet, have a good Christmas.
John Noble.

Hiya boys and girls! This is the
'tongue-in-cheek view of student life'
but, the trouble is, it's reached that
stage in the term when there's f**k
all happening, so I've got so little to
talk about. Either way there is
something happening which I don't
k n o w , stuff it in the Maths
pigeonhole. By the way my tongue is
in my cheek and not between anybody
elses, so don't go thinking I'll be
inoffensive.
Firsdy, I just tried a new Norman's
omelette, now I admire the cooking
and diversification this place is
undergoing, but, gentle readers,
unless you've got twenty-five minutes
spare don't bother with the wait, my
advice to you if you want a quick one
is to invest in a pack of Norman's
condoms instead.
Now I have just started noticing
how halls are developing a C C U
oudook on life. They have developed
chants ranging from the boring
'everywhere we go...' from Linstead
to the esoteric 'Bugabahstud,
Bugabahstud, whangle' from
Holbein. The spirit and rationality of
mascotry has been captured in
stealing one another's fridges. A l l the
houses need to do now is develop the
vaguely useful bits of C C U life.
I hear that at Tuesday's U G M a
motion almost made it that each of the
C C U s should adopt one of George,
Zippy and Bungle from Rainbow as
a mascot and Ian Howgate should
invite Geoffrey over to give a talk.
Personally I'm in favour of this
because it will give added character
to the C C U s for instance I'd like
George for RCS because I like pink,
Zippy (the pyjama case) and the R S M
have a lot in common (they're all
stuffed with materials). This leaves
Bungle for C & G . . .
Rag Week is over, but who won the
Killer game? It was real fun adding
paranoia to College life, squirting the
College security when they break into
your house. Still the halls were
annoyed. One house has even charged
an £8 fine to one player for 'wilful
damage to property'. The College
authorities were so worried about
damp in the Hamlet Gardens.
That's all I gotta say for now
T T F N .
PS. Has anyone noticed how
Howgate is an anagram for 'what
ego'?
4 Friday 4th December 1987 FELIX
