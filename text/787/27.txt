ULU want toilet training
Imperial students on a Rag event
caused £1,175 worth of damage in the
U L U building during Rag Week. The
event was 'drink-a-pub-dry',
although, according to U L U President
Jon Tilsead, because the effect the IC
students had on the other customers,
the takings were actually down on the
usual amount and they had more beer
left at the end than normal.
U L U Vice President (Services)
'Norm' Robinson is to bring the
matter up at the next General Union
Council. Most of the £1,175 damages
are to replace signs that were stolen
if they are not returned, although
damage was done to the building and
some students were caught urinating
in a corridor.
After the event M r Tilsead wrote
to I C U President Ian Howgate
complaining about the behaviour and
endorsing some Union cards they had
collected from some of the students
involved. He suggested that 'toilet
training' could be arranged for some
of the offenders.
M r Howgate has replied by
apologising for the damage caused
and indicated that he is tracking down
those students concerned. He told
F E L I X he was 'very disappointed'
that the event got out of hand and that
the idea of going to U L U was that any
profits would go benefit students.
Music Room
protest
A protest against the loss of College
music rooms is to take place on
Tuesday December 15. A carol
concert is being held at lunchtime
(12.30pm) on that day, outside the
Senior Common Room in Sherfield.
All College musicians are welcome
to turn up, as is anyone who wants
to help make the point. Singing ability
is not important.
For further details ask Richard
Squires, S C A B Chairman.
RCSU debt
The Royal College of Science Union
is facing severe financial problems
due to large College bills which have
not been paid over the last five years.
The College bills come to over £5000
which cover debts to Central Stores
and Refectories. There is the
additional burden of a £500 loss made
on the Freshers' dinners this year.
R C S U Honorary Junior Treasurer
David Williams said yesterday that
the main debts arose during the period
of office of the former R C S U Senior
Treasurer. They have only come to
light in the last year when D r Ken
Bignal took over the job of Senior
Treasurer. He discovered that no
College bills had been paid and that
dinner monies had not been collected.
Last year when the debts were
unearthed it was decided that all the
Union's assets would be realised. The
Union still owes College over £5000
which will have to be paid back as
soon as possible.
Mr Williams believes that the debts
arose due to 'bad attitude in the Union
about spending'. Most sections of the
Union have overspent. He said that
as soon as this year's allocation runs
out clubs, activities and publications
will have to stop.
Gas alert
A spray can containing a tear gas
derivative was let off at the end of a
gig at the University of London Union
(ULU) last week.
Following an argument between
two women after the band, one of
them let off a 'mace spray',
containing the gas, in the other's face.
The sprays are intended to be used by
women in case of attack, and although
they are illegal in the U K they are
freely available on the continent.
The spray was completely emptied
which, in the packed hall, caused a
very unpleasant effect and the room
emptied '.cry quickly. There were
reports of students coughing and with
eyes streaming, and in the confusion
the offender escaped.
U L U Vice President (Services)
'Norm' Robinson told F E L I X that,
short of a full body search, there was
little hope of stopping incidents such
as this.
