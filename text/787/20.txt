Wish You Were Here
Two notable debuts are made in one
of the hits of this year's Cannes Film
Festival, Wish You Were Here. One
can quite understand why Emily
Lloyd, the sixteen year old star of the
film (and only just sixteen when it was
made), has aroused so much media
interest, and since become something
of a celebrity. Quite apart from her
slightly unusual tomboyish good
looks, she gives a performance of
astounding maturity for one so
inexperienced. Credit must also go to
actor/writer David Leland, here
directing for the first time, who has
created the realistic aifd interesting
character played by Lloyd and,
around her, a closely observed picture
of postwar provincial Britain.
Lynda is growing up in a small
conservative and close-knit seaside
town, which she finds unrelentingly
boring, and where she cannot hold
down a job due to her rather tactless
lack of self control. She lives with her
stiff-lipped, petty-minded father and
younger sister. Her mother, the only
real symbol of love in her life, having
died when she was young. The
relationship with her father is
important for he is totally incapable
of handling or understanding his
headstrong and sharp-mouthed
teenage daughter, and the resulting
lack of affection is clearly one of the
major aspects affecting Lynda's
personality. Confusing sex with
affection she drifts through a series
of encounters until she meets Eric,
convincingly played by Tom Bell, a
friend of her fathers and local cinema
projectionist, who sees that he can
abuse Lynda's innocence. Her life is
thrown into further disarray when she
becomes pregnant by Eric, and the
rest of the film is devoted to the
dilemma she feels about the child.
Wish You Were Here is simply an
exerpt from Lynda's life and certainly
doesn't attempt to answer any
questions, which I thought made the
ending rather weak. However, what
makes the film special is undoubtedly
the character of Lynda. She has a
heartwarming combination o f
innocence with cheeky rebeliousness,
exemplified by her constant use of
semi-rude insults like "cock o f f and
"up yer b u m " , that could only occur
in an adolescent girl. But she also has
a resiliance and intelligence that gives
the film a note of optimism.
Both Leland and Lloyd are to be
congratulated, Wish You Were Here
certainly deserves the amount of
acclaim it has recently received and,
if it is a true reflection of their talents,
I look forward to their next projects.

Howlin'Wilf and the Veejays
Not much to be said really. If you
were there you will have enjoyed two
hours of sweaty excitement. If you
weren't, you missed the best way to
spend a pound on Thursday night.
The band appeared late—as is
usual—but with a better excuse than
some others (they had to be torn away
from the quiz in the Snack Bar). A l l
the members played with talent and
enthusiasm to create a compulsive
rhythm. They are not the sort of band
to have any major recording success,
but then again who wants to listen to
this sort of music being played by
your local medallion man DJ or even
in the comfort of your own squat? It's
hard to have any desire to trek half-
way across L o n d o n and pay
something around £4 when bands of
the same calibre appear in the Lounge
on an almost weekly basis for a
fraction of the cost.
If you weren't there, give yourself
a hefty kick and turn up for Real
Sounds of Africa on Thursday.

Going Solo
by Roald Dahl
Roald Dahl is undisputedly an
excellent storyteller but he should
never be judged by television
productions of his work. Television
only shows the content of his writing,
and misses his masterful control of the
English language.
However, having said that, Going
Solo certainly does not rely solely on
good writing as M r Dahl has squeezed
more of interest into the three years
this book recounts than others fit into
a life time. One starts off with an
insight into colonial types as the
author travels to pre-war Tanzania,
but we are not permitted long to dwell
on that before the war breaks out and
he is seconded into the army. Before
joining the. R A F he almost dies in a
crash before even seeing the enemy,
then with no air combat experience
he is thrown in at the deep end. O f
course we know he survived and this
means we can look forward to another
volume of his full and varied life
being published.
Unlike other autobiographies which
seem to be merely blowing the
authors' own trumpets, Roald Dahl,
who does have every right to show
off the life he has led, tells his story
with absolute modesty that is a delight
to read, and should be read by
everyone.

Kiss Me Kate
(RSC at the Old Vic)
They say that Kiss Me Kate is Cole
Porter's best musical, and has been
seen almost non-stop by audiences
since its first performance in late
December 1984. After sitting through
the RSC's production, it is easy to see
why.
It opened in January 1987 and
contains not only all the standard
'musical' offerings: lavish sets,
chorus numbers, solos and duets, but
also refeshing attempts at innovation
in the direction, design and
choreography. This is amply
exhibited in the first number Another
Op 'nin, Another Show, where chorus
members provide their o w n
illumination, with small hand-held
lights, creating a delightful spectacle
and proving that the RSC's wealth of
talent extends to dancing and singing
as well as acting.
The story concerns a production of
The Taming of the Shrew starring
Fred Graham (James Smillie) and the
legendary Lilli Vanessi (ex-wife of
M r Graham). Their bickering on-
stage (helped by the Bard) is mild
compared to the exchanges off-stage,
where no help is needed. The 'play-
within-a-play' seemed the weak point
of the evening. The costumes and
acting were (we take it) purposefully
over the top, but unfortunately the
actors let it become a little too much.
The story started to fade and one
became slightly more aware of the
sets and lights. But help was at hand
in the guise of songs including the
brilliantly delivered / Hate Men by
Kate (alias Lilli Vanessi, portrayed by
Nichola McAuliffe) although they
didn't quite blot out the memory.
As with so many musicals, the
second half heralded the beginning of
the end, the sub-plots started to
conclude and the main plot was
slowing down. But just as this was
becoming noticeable on came the
gansters (their relevance to the plot
being a little too complex to mention
here) and we were treated to
undoubtedly the best number of the
evening in Brush Up Your
Shakespeare. Fitting Corialanus,
Romeo and Juliet et al into rhyming
couplets is not easy, but M r Porter
gave us both pace and humour with
the most delightful of subjects.
He's been described as the best
songwriter this century, and a trip to
see this very enjoyable musical, will
make you see why.
