Get Santa!
Santa Claus has
grown disillusioned
with reindeer and
mince pies. He has
become depressed
at the thought of
having to deliver
billions of presents
in just 24 hours.
He is getting old
and feels the cold
more nowadays.
That is why he has
decided to go
AWOL-but for a
good cause. He has
joined forces with
the Elimination of
Leukaemia Fund
(ELF) in order to
raise money to fund
nursing staff and
equipment at Kings
College Hospital.
Four Londoners are diagnosed with
Leukaemia or a related cancer every
day. If they are lucky they face
injections, medication and blood
transfusions while doctors work to kill
off the cancerous cells in their body.
But there is a real shortage of beds,
nurses and equipment to treat
Leukaemia. E L F aims to build a new
treatment unit at Kings College
Hospital. Santa and E L F are raising
this money by holding a giant Santa
Hunt around London on Sunday 13th
December. A l l IC students can join
in the hunt, starting from the Time
Out offices in Southampton Street at
4pm. It is a ten-point trail to Santa and
should take 1-2 hours. Once you've
found where he is, you can join the
party! Money is raised by sponsorship
for every checkpoint you successfully
discover. There are some very good
prizes as well. There will be a draw
from everyone who finds Santa for a
Wintersun week for two in Luxor,
Egypt, and the best fundraiser wins
a £500 day at Way In at Harrods plus
a Psion Organiser II.
A limited number of sponsorship
forms are available from the F E L I X
Office.
Whilst in Soho last Sunday, having
just gorged myself on a selection of
delicious Chinese cakes and gallons
of fresh tea from the Kowloon in
Gerrard Street and although feeling
a little worse for wear for eating too
much, it struck me that I should try
my hand at a little Chinese cuisine.
With a budget of only a fiver I
scrapped the idea of treating myself
to a wok and seeing as it is necessary
to be in a position of professional
upward mobility to have such a utensil
in one's kitchen I decided that I didn't
exactly qualify and considered my
position, as typesetter operator for
F E L I X , as being, in contrast,
absolutely stationary.
Anyway putting all these thoughts
out of my head I set about gathering
together the ingredients for 'Duck
Noodle Soup'. The meat for this
recipe was bought in what I can only
describe as a Chinese duck shop, also
in Gerrard Street, where I managed
to overcome a slight language
problem and ordered half a duck
which was magnificently jointed by
a man with a big cleaver and very
nimble fingers who doesn't drink at
lunchtime if he's got any sense. After
purchasing my duck (which comes
ready-cooked) I headed for the nearest
supermarket where I was confronted
by lots of tea varieties, types of
noodles, and Chinese people all of
which made life a little more difficult.
Back in the sanctuary of my kitchen
in Mitcham I set about preparing the
soup and the recipe is as follows:
Ingredients for 3 people:
Chicken stock
Vi a cooked duck
Vi lb dried noodles
l
A lb Chinese leaves (or similar
vegetable)
Salt and pepper to taste
Method:
Cook the noodles in a large pan of
boiling water until they break apart
and soften slightly, wash in cold water
and drain for a minute or two, transfer
the noodles and the duck into the
stock (which should be boiling as
well) cook all this for about five
mi nites and at the very last point add
the Chinese leaves. This recipe is so
easy and getting the ingredients can
be great fun—so have a go!
