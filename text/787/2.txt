It's been a busy week and nothing's
dropped off the litho—yet! I hope that
you find at least one article worth
reading out of the 28 pages this week.
Don't you feel sorry for, Ian
Howgate? It must have been really
terrible being stuck down in
Guildford for nearly four days. I
wouldn't like to be stuck in Guildford
for even one hour.
For all of you who did witness
Tuesday's U G M , it is easy to see that
decisions are made not on the validity
of an argument but because of sheer
numbers of people who wouldn't
normally attend a U G M but come
because they have an interest in a
motion. Congratulations to Roland
Smith, Tizard Subwarden, whose
excellent publicity persuaded
Southside residents to turn out in
force to support his motion.
The Honorary Secretary
is a lazy toad—official
There is something that I wanted to
bring up at the Union General
Meeting on Tuesday but because it
was a complete shambles we never
got as far as the Honorary Secretary's
2 KEVIN
report before Quorum was called.
Last week a few members of the
F E L I X staff made an arrangement
with the Hon Sec that we would
produce publicity posters for the
U G M over the weekend if he would
arrange to have them put up around
College. He agreed. Our reasons
were purely that we believed that
rather than criticising the lack of
publicity for U G M s we would do
something about it. So we spent our
weekend designing and printing 200
day-glo posters which were duly
delivered to the Hon Sec at 10am on
Monday morning. B y Tuesday
lunchtime there was one poster up in
the Union Office and one which I put
up in the F E L K Office, I suggest mat
M r Jackson should pay the £30 they
cost the Union to produce.
Secondly, he rang up on Monday
asking if we could save him a space
on the Union page for a report. I'm
"still waiting for the report and the
U n i o n page was printed on
Wednesday. This is why the Union
page contains very little to do with the
Union!
These are very petty gripes in
themselves but they're just small
things in a long line of small things.
• Last week he told a club that a van
was free and gave it to them when it
had already been booked for a Rag
Raid. Rag eventually had to hire a
£140 van. This is not the first time
something like this has happened.
• He promised to produce Exec News
every two weeks in his election
manifesto which the Hon Sec is meant
to edit as a supplement to F E L I X . It
has come out once.
• The U G M started nearly half an
hour late because the papers had not
arrived.
• The first Council of term was
cancelled at very short notice because
notification and papers had not been
sent out. The second Council was not
cancelled although the same thing
happened again.
The Honorary Secretary has very
little to do anyway so he/she should
do the limited amount of work given
to them to do—and do it satisfactorily.
Otherwise he/she should be 'got rid
o f . It only takes % majority at 2
consecutive U G M s . There probably
wouldn't be any publicity anyway!
Next Week
There will be no F E L I X next Friday
as it is the penultimate week of this
term. Instead there will be a bumper
Christmas edition on Wednesday
December 16. Deadlines for features
is next Monday; for sports is
Wednesday night; for What's Ons and
Small A d s is Wednesday; and for
letters is Thursday.
Sweatshirts
We now have a new stock of F E L I X
sweatshirts. W e have the original
black/blue design and a new limited
edition black/purplypink. Both
designs are on grey sweatshirts. They
make ideal gifts for family and friends
at just £7 (plug, plug).
