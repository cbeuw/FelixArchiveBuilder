The Marathon Man
Why did Chas Brereton miss the Hypnosis lecture last year? Why does he want to become
a merchant banker this year? Is this article just more blatant self-publicity? Read on to
find out just what it's like to play lift music for 40 hours!
Introduction*
If you were in the J C R on Tuesday
17th or Wednesday 18th November
then you would have heard music—
but not of the usual IC Radio variety!
Instead, you would have heard what
has been described as 'Interesting
Cocktail Music' . For the third year
running, I played the piano for 40
hours during Rag Week. This article
is intended to give an insight into how
this event has run for the past 3 years.
Where did it all
start?
I first had the idea of doing a piano
marathon in 1984, when I came to IC.
I had heard about Rag Week and the
various events taking p l a c e -
including the 1,000,001 down darts
marathon. I considered that a
sponsored piano-marathon would be
an ideal way for me to get involved
with Rag at IC. Unfortunately, I did
not know enough about Rag or the
way the Union worked to organise the
event that year. The next year,
however, I was able to ask John
Ingham (Rag Chairman 85/86) to help
me organise it.
I started collecting sponsorships
amongst friends in my department and
amongst members of the various clubs
and societies to which I belonged. I
also approached Dep Reps and asked
them to take sponsorship forms to the
students in their respective
departments. The event itself took
place in a notable absence of publicity
in the most unlikely of venues: the
Brown Committee room at the top of
the Union Building. In fact, it nearly
didn't happen at all; at 5.55am the
Beit Quad Security guard. was
searching frantically for the keys to
the OpSoc room so I could get in and
use their piano!
In spite of the lack of publicity and
the teething problems encountered
with any event that takes place for the
first time, I raised £401.50 that year.
1986—things get a
bit better...
Last year I was determined to get
myself organised well before the
marathon. I needed a better venue, for
a start. The Sherfield foyer was
suggested as the place which has the
most people passing through it daily,
but Security would have none of that.
So I setded on the J C R . I was able
to borrow Rob Northey's piano (used
for refectory functions). The other
main consideration was getting
sponsorships. I had been booked to
play the piano at some of the Guilds
Fresher's Buffets early in the term,
so I took advantage of this to get
sponsorships from those present. This
accounted for the bulk of the
sponsorships obtained. During the
marathon itself I was able to rely on
Man Tai Tseung (Rag Chairman
86-87) to provide me with helpers
who would make numerous cups of
coffee and go round collecting
sponsorships from people in the JCR.
The morning hours weren't too bad;
people were always popping in
(Drink-a-Pub-Dry survivors were still
crawling back to IC at 3am!)
including a delegation from Q T Soc!
I finished on time at 10pm just as
Martin Taylor's Hypnosis lecture was
ending.
Collecting the money was not so
easy this time. I had 500 names from
every department on the forms and
there was no way I could go and see
all of them. I tried sending notes to
all concerned but the response rate
was abysmal. In the end I raised
£805.37 out of the £1,700 on the
forms. The fact that I was working
in the Centre Tor Biotechnology
during last year didn't help!
Third year blues
I was in two minds as to whether
to do this event this year. On one hand
it seemed natural to continue and try
to raise as much money for Rag as
possible. On the other, this being my
final year was not going to make
collecting easier than before.
I decided that if I was going to
collect more money than in previous
years I would have to iron out all the
problems faced in past years. Lack of
publicity was a major problem in the
past, but this year the marathon was
an official Rag Week event and as
such appeared on all the posters. I
also designed and photocopied my
own posters.
On the sponsorship front I played
at all the R C S and Guilds fresher's
dinners and was able to collect money
from people as they sponsored me;
this has meant that relatively fewer
people need to be chased up from
each dinner as opposed to the amount
of money which has been collected
already. In fact, I've been to 25
fresher's dinners since I came to IC-
but bought a ticket for only one of
them (highly dubious, Chas!)
At the time of writing (1.06 am,
Tuesday lst December) the total
amount pleged on the forms is
£2,300ish of which about £1,200 has
been collected already.
Criticisms
On the face of it, it looks like a lot
of money is going to be raised for
Rag. Nevertheless, my piano-
marathon has come in for criticism
from various people. I feel it is only
fair that answer some of these
criticisms.
F i r s t , several people have
complained at the methods I use to get
people to sponsor me. Some have
asked me whether I want to become
a Timeshare/double glazing salesman
(no, I want to become a stockbroking
yuppie!). I make no apologies
whatsoever for adopting a "hard-
sell" approach. In many cases I had
to " c o l d - c a l l " ; i.e. approach total
strangers from scratch. I learned
quickly that you do not raise
thousands for Rag by taking no for
an answer. Briefly, there are 3 sorts
of people, (i) those who will readily
sponsor me, sometimes without me
having to ask them, (ii) those who will
sponsor me but need to be "sold on
the idea" (by far the majority), and
(iii) the mean b*st*rds who don't give
a sh*t about the good work done by
charities and the help given to them
• by IC students. I won't name names
but these people know who they are
and why I have little time for them.
Others have questioned my motives
for doing the marathon. The best
"excuse" that I heard was that last
year I did the marathon to restore my
Union credibility after screwing up
my second year exams! I can only say
that in view of the time and effort
involved in organising the marathon
this is pretty feeble. I certainly wasn't
thinking of my "credibility" after
being without proper sleep for a day
and a half. I should point out that I
actually lose money on this event—I
don't claim back any of my expenses
(this year has cost me about £25).
Finally, some people have asked
what happens if they don't pay. Last
year a Physics fresher asked me if I
would be "sending the boys round"
if she didn't pay up! (Yes I can still
remember you asking!) I can do
without such cynicism; I have no
means of enforcing people to pay
other than appealing to their
consciences.
Next year
L.I won't be here. I would be
disappointed if this event died because
no-one could play the piano for 40
hours (believe me it's not all that
difficult). Most of the time I churned
out improvised 'elevator/restaur-
ant/background music'; I don't mean
to boast but it requires very little
effort to produce this sort of music for
hours on end! If there are any pianists
out there would might be interested
in doing this marathon next year I
would be more than glad to give them
the benefit of 3 years experience.
This article would be incomplete
without thanks to everyone who has
ever helped me with the marathon in
whatever way.
