Plane trivia
Who was the first Arab in space?
What is the national airline of
Malawi? These and even more obtuse
questions were asked at the Royal
Aeronautical Society's A e r o
Challenge (a sort of aviation Trivial
Pursuit), held on November 27. Two
teams from IC faced competition from
18 other university and polytechnic
teams. Both teams survived the initial
round-robin, but unfortunately IC 2
bowed out in the quarter-finals. After
much nail-biting, IC 1, consisting of
Steve McParlin (capt), Phil Chandy
and Nick Lay ('The Muttley Crew'),
managed to reach the final, where
they faced the defending champions,
the dreaded Glasgow Engineers. IC
started shakily, but gradually drew
ahead to finish with a clear winning
margin of 185-95. The victors were
presented with the Aero Challenge
shield by the quizmaster, Raymond
Baxter, and were invited to the RAeS
annual dinner to be re-awarded the
shield by the president.
Many thanks to Dave Johnson-
Newell for turning up in response to
a panic request for team members and
staying to score (mug!).

Total
beginners
The Weights Club has, up until now,
been unsuitable for total beginners.
However next term instruction will be
provided for anybody who is
interested in weight-training. The
initial training will give participants
a general introduction, upon which
more specialised training, for
whatever goal, may be built.
Anybody at any level, who is
interested in weight training for
whatever reason, is welcome. This is
just a notification of plans for next
term. Details will be given in the next
issue of F E L I X and at the beginning
of next term, though training sessions
will be at lunchtimes next term.

Race circuit
Members of Guilds Motor (and
sporting motorcycle) Club hired the
Goodwood race circuit last Saturday
for a day of general testing. Each
driver had three twenty-minute
sessions of track time with
experienced instructors for
newcomers.
As always, safety was of utmost
importance with a full complement of
flag marshals, fire extinguishers and
an ambulance.
S N O O K E R
Handicapped
Thirty-two people entered this year's
open competition which was held in
the Snooker Club during last week.
With over 200 club members, this
was a pretty disappointing
tournament.
Play proceeded on Monday evening
and by semi-final stage there were,
rather predictably, only committee
members left, although Chairman
Richard Wiles had a close scrape in
the quarter finals against Graham
Greenaway of Civ Eng. Graham was
robbed of a 2-0 lead by a desperately
unlucky foul in the second frame. It
proved to be the turning point of the
match and he eventually lost 3-1.
The final stages were a gruelling
test since much pride was at stake.
The final result was as follows: Open
Champion 1987: Martin Hall, Runner
up Richard Wiles, third place Andy
Poon and fourth was Clive Roberts.
The highest break was 31, scored by
Wiles.
Looking ahead, Snooker Club
hopes to run a handicap competition
before Easter, but what handicap do
we give? We presently have a big
break chart and soon we are starting
a ladder. These are two very
important ways of assessing a player's
ability. B y giving players a handicap
everybody has an equal chance of
winning—or so the theory goes. So
my advice to all members is to join
the ladder! It's worth it because the
Easter handicap is the tournament of
the year.
DIGGERS
Pub gold
This Tuesday (December 8) Diggers
Club is organising a sponsored charity
pub crawl run along the lines of a
game of golf. Teams of four are
required to take, on average, four
'shots' per 'hole' on an eighteen hole
course. Points are acquired per shot
taken with sponsorship being paid on
a per point basis. Money raised will
go to IC Rag (50%) and Imperial
Cancer Research.
A shot is taken by drinking one half
of beer/lager, a short or a pint of soft
drink. Bunkers and differently parred
holes are included on the course. The
course itself consists of a number of
holes around College.
As golf is a civilised game played
by civilised people, anyone behaving
in an ungentlemanly or
unsportsmanlike manner, for example
throwing up, will be considered to
have lost his/her ball, their team will
consequently be fined one or more
shots at the marshals' discretion.
Prizes will be awarded to the team
scoring the most points and the team
raising the most money. These will
be engraved tankards kept behind the
Union Bar for use by team members
until the following year's tournament.
If there are any more interested
people could you contact the
following asap:
Nigel Baker (Chem Eng 4),
Mike Oxley ( M R E 2),
Greg Wright (Physics 3).
£2 per team green fees is payable, all
of which will go to charity.
SRI L A N K A
Cup of tea
The Sri Lankan Society's 'drink a cup
of tea for Rag' proved to be a success.
The stall held in the first half of Rag
Week may well have broken new
ground by the involvement of an
Overseas Students Committee society
in Rag.
Only the best, pure Sri Lankan tea,
considered by connoisseurs to be the
best in the world, was served. The tea
was supplied free by the Ceylon Tea
Centre.
Tea and Rag Mags were sold
generating a total of £124. M y thanks
to everyone who helped. I was
pleasantly surprised at the number of
people who helped despite being non-
members, simply because it was for
Rag.
P H O T O
Dark hole
Photosoc has suffered the past few
years by having a membership solely
of shadows who disappear at
unearthly hours down a hole in Beit
Quad. After weeks of scratching and
scraping at the old paintwork, the
same dark hole has now been
redecorated and a new high-profile
club is emerging.
Photosoc offers everything you
would want to develop and print black
and white or colour films and Club
members can get cheap films, paper
and chemicals through bulk purchases
with the Club. If you don't know an
f-stop from a bus stop you will be
given your first black and white film
and even shown how to develop it and
print up the results—so don't be afraid
to show your ignorance. There will
be a special meeting for new members
in the upper part of Southside near the
side entrance on Tuesday at 5.30pm
where you can lounge around and ask
any questions. If you're already keen
to join then bring the usual passport
sized photo along so that you can be
issued with a glossy membership
card.
For regular members, or if
Tuesdays aren't your scene the Club
meets Thursdays at 5.30pm in the
Brown Committee Room at the top of
the Union Building near STOIC.
If any previous members of
Photosoc have anything stored in the
darkrooms contact Sophie Jackson
(int 4541), Phil Turner (int 7488) or
come along on Tuesdays 5.30pm,
Southside.
