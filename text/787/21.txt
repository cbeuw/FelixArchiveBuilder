Flying low
U A U First Round
IC's basketball team found themselves
wandering through low flying clouds
in N W 1 0 very early last Sunday
morning in search of the first rounds
of the U A U .
It proved to be an eventful day with
the team virtually running the whole
show, such is the poor level of
organising by the U A U .
Consequently it was after clearing the
gym of the previous evening's
effluent (it might be added, with no
help from the arrogant Brunei
University squad) that play could
actually commence.
IC's first two games, against Brunei
and L S E , were very tough but proved
useful training. The bench should be
congratulated for their sportsmanship
for giving L S E a standing ovation
when they reached 100 points!
The final game against Kent was a
real nail-biter, the score fluctuating
up to plus or minus 10 points. At half
time the IC squad got fired up for a
blistering second half. Steve Ancell
covered more court in ten minutes
than in the previous game and with
support from Adam Galambos,
Spencer Sherwin, Mark Ridgill,
Stuart Martin and the rest of the team,
successfully clawed back a 9 point
deficit in the last minute of play. The
IC substitutes, on the bench at that
time, were in full cry with lashings
of advice on how to bury Kent. The
last seconds saw the team go ahead
by 2 points and successfully fend off
Kent's frenzied last stand.
The day ended with an excellent
display of control from L S E who
slaughtered a, now less arrogant,
Brunei. IC now has the prospect of
the second round to look forward to.

Friendly shooting
On Saturday November 21 IC Rifle
and Pistol Club's pistol team went to
Cobham R P C to shoot in a friendly
Police Pistol, P P 1 , match.
PP1 is a thirty round course of fire
which is usually shot with a 0.38"
calibre revolver. It consists of three
timed stages at distances of 25m, 15m
and 10m with the final stage being
two shots in two seconds.
The match was shot outdoors in far
from ideal conditions, which
handicapped the IC team because we
are used to the comforts of indoor \
shooting.
We were totally outclassed by a far
more experienced club whose team
included the current British champion
of three years standing. Our best
score being 284 out of 300 compared
to their 300 followed by two 297s.
However, we are undetered by this
experience and have arranged a return
match on St Valentine's Day (this
time we'll do the massacring!).
We are still open for membership.
If anyone is interested in joining then
please come and see us, on any
weekday lunchtime, at the range in
the Sports Centre.

7 in a row
IC lst X V - 3 0
G u y s - 9
IC stretched their unbeaten run to
seven games after a good
performance against Guys in the
second round of the Gutteridge Cup
despite missing four regular first team
players.
From the start Guys came out
strongly winning a good ruck and
maul ball and pinning IC in their own
'22'. After absorbing the initial attack
IC hit back with a double switch move
leaving Jez Quirk only three players
to beat and scoring under the posts.
A few minutes later from a good
rucked ball A Watson fed T Paul who
put Jez away for his second try. Guys
hit back with a penalty to make the
score 10-3 and from the restart S
Blamo coming into the line gave
Simon Hall space on the left wing to
run in from fourty yards beating three
men on the way. IC stepped up the
pressure and with mintues to go to
half time A Watson ripped round the
blindside to score the last try of the
first half.
In the second half, Guys with the
wind came back but good tackling by
the back row kept Guys out. Then
came the run of the match. Inside his
own half Andy Watson broke blind
from a maul, shrugged off the hooker,
dummied the winger and fly half,
side-stepped the centre, before
passing to the hooker in the corner.
From the resulting scrum M Tilbury
drove down the blindside for the first
of his two debutante tries. Guys then
scored a consolation try before M
Tilbury crossed again to make the
final score 30-9.

Going schizophrenic
Last Sunday, the Club attempted to
go schizophrenic and attend two
events in the same day, half the Club
going to an event in Nottingham and
half to Berkhamstead.
The area at Nottingham, in
Sherwood Forest, was flat and
runable and due to the icy conditions,
some orienteers skated across part of
their course.
However, the group going to
Berkhamstead failed to reach the
event and even failed to set off from
College due to the fact that the
minibus that had been booked had
been given to another club, without
prior notice.
One success of the weekend was
Tom Foster coming fifth in the British
Night Championships on Saturday
evening.
The results have now come through
from the K a r r i m o r Mountain
Marathon held in late October.
Orienteers Matthew Lynas and Dave
Clarke came 120th out of a field of
over 300 on the score event, a very
creditable position for their first go.

Amazing manoeuvres
After a few delays, the team made an
early start for Bristol. It was another
cold Saturday morning.
On arrival at the Chens Valley
Reservoir, the ice was removed from
the boats in preparation for the big
race. Despite favourable forecasts
from the captain (Richard Jarman)
there was only a patchy light breeze,
and it was still cold. Roll tacks were
to be the order of the day, this made
Jenny Burton very nervous.
Apostolos Leouidhopoulos did not
capsize however, and went on to do
some amazing tactical manoeuvres,
only a few involved collisions.
Although Bristol's second team put
up a good fight the final score was
4-1. Our infamous ladies' team
fancied their chances but
unfortunately time ran out. Luck was
on our side.
Many thanks to Bristol, especially
for the overnight accommodation and
special transport.
