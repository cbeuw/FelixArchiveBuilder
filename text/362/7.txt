International
Socialists
Joe Herbertson
Who are we?
The International Socialists
are the fastest growing and
largest revolutionary organ-
isation in Britain today. A
'factory' branch exists in
College with the main pers-
pective of building a strong
socialist presence from within
the technical and manual
workers of the College.
Current members are all active
members of the College-based
trade unions, NUPE and
ASTMS, and are committed to
fighting for militant policies
on wages and conditions, and
for extending democracy to
achieve rank and file control.
Students .
Students are encouraged to
join or work with IS members,
and in the past undergraduate
members have committed
themselves to the main trade
union work. If sufficient
students show an interest in
student union politics, then
an IS Society will be formed.
A national IS student paper,
the Agitator, will make its
appearance this term. Student
work in the Grants Campaign
will concentrate on the poor
deal Colleges of Further
Education received in the
recent grant increases. A l l
students in and around IS
will be expected to sell
'Socialist Worker' in the
departments, to gain a personal
contact with College workers.
There is no place for student
elitism. It will be up to student
members to gain credibility
for socialist politics by serious
and mature work, s uch c redi bi I ity
has unfortunately been squan-
dered by recent IC 'lefties'.
Bookstall.
A regular bookstall, with
excellent ordering facilities
for any left wing literature
in print, will function on
Thursday lunchtimes in the
J.C.R., College Block.
Meetings.
Regular speaker meetings
on the politics of the Inter-
national Socialists have
covered such topics as China,
Portugal, Chile, Economic
crisis, rank and file trade
unionism, and the National
Front. Meetings in the near
future should include industrial
safety, the Labour Party, the
General Strike, Portugal,
racism and so on. Watch out
for leaflets and posters.
Overseas Students.
The IS branch places
special emphasis on involving
overseas students, in particular
the older and more experienced
postgraduates. Many of them
know from harsh experience
what it means to suffer from
imperialism, and these people
should provide a valid impetus
for solidarity campaigns. The
continued domination of third
world countries has an important
technological aspect and
moves to counteract this
within this College should
be part of the political activities
of overseas students in part-
icular. Overseas students from
countries where the Church
and the peasantry are still
significant political factors
could gain useful experience
by working inside British
politics which are directly
those of an advanced industrial
society. Many overseas students
will want to make their
involvement informal or even
anonymous, and we clearly
recognise the seriousness of
their positions.
FINAL NOTE.
The potential for a strong
revolutionary socialist move-
ment is great at the present
time in which Britain heads
for deeV economic and social
crisis. Big changes to the
left or right could come in the
next ten years. Make your
choice now, before it is too
late.
