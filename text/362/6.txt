6 FELIX
Summer Trip To
The Dolomites
Mike Wright
ANYONE PASSING65 Evelyn Gardens
on the morning of August 3rd, may have
wondered why the pavement was blocked
by seven bodies, a large number of
rucksacks, tents and a not inconsiderable
quantity of dried curries and steamed
puddings.
Everything was ready for our annual
summer camping expedition—everything
except for the minibus, now boasting a
new clutch, but sadly minus an exhaust
pipe.
Finally with our own 'Jackie Stewart'
at the wheel we arrived at the hoverport
in time to miss the flight by seconds.
A fairly uneventful drive down
through France brought us to a campsite
at Annecy, not far from Chamonix. The
following day was spent struggling up
a hill in the blistering heat. The next
stop was reached after an interesting
drive over the Petit St. Bernard Pass
into Italy, then via Turino and Milano
to Nus near Lake Garda.
Two days were spent in Venice
where our resident 'culture-vultures'
sampled the delights of the Palazzo
Ducale and the legendary Ponte dei
Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). By this time
some of the more energetic members
of the party were craving for some more
hills to climb, and so we set off for the
Dolomites.
We had our first real look at the
Dolomites after ascending the chair
lift and cable car to the Rifugio di
Rosetta at 2581m in the Pale di San
Martino. A pleasant day was spent
walking around the high plateau with
occasional glimpses of the Fradusta
glacier.
We camped at v^prvara for the next
week and from this base we were
treated to some of the most spectacular
scenery that the Dolomites has to offer.
A short drive from the campsite around
an endless succession of hairpin bends
led us to the foot of the Marmolada.
This is the highest mountain in the
Dolomites, the summit at 10,965ft being
visible for miles around.
Half of the party decided to walk to
the bottom of the glacier (an extensive
glacier covers the northern slopes)
while the others chose to ascend the
mountain by cable car. A stroll across
the ice gave ample opportunity for the
taking of 'Look! Here I am climbing a
vertical ice-field!' photographs. During
the first World War the Marmolada
glacier was part of the front line and
many miles of tunnels were dug in the
ice. Another peak in the area the Col
di Lana gained such stategic importance
that the Italians finally blasted the
summit with five tons of high explosive.
Having seen the views from the
Marmolada we knew that the nearby
Sasso Lungo would live up to all
expectations. The Sasso Lungo is one
of the most impressive crests of the
Dolomites, stretching as it does for
some two miles above the Passo di
Sella. It was well worth the few
hundred lire to ascend the lift to 2679m
in order to sample the scree on the way
down to the van.
To the north of Corvara, the mighty
Sellagruppe rises vertically from green
pastures to culminate in the Piz BoS
at 10,339ft. This 1000ft rock pyramid
was reached after a sweaty climb in
the now customary blazing sunshine.
The descent to Corvara and the
campsite was no less spectacular. The
path left the Rifugio di Boe and plunged
down into the Val di Mesdi at an
alarming angle. An interesting slide
down a few hundred feet of ice and
snow led to firmer scree slopes.
The next day we drove over the
Brenner Pass into Austria and camped
at Innsbruck. After stocking up with
food and booze we headed for Lermoos
near the border of Germany. A very
good day was spent climbing the
6 000ft to the top of the Zugspitze -
the highest peak in West Germany.
The summit was reached after an
exhilarating scramble up metal foot
stirrups and wire handrails over the
shattered rocks.
The remaining days were spent
swimming in the excellent lakes near
Lermoos and in visiting the castles,
Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau,
of King Ludwig.
We decided to return via Switzerland
and France and were unfortunate enough
to find a cafe in Boulogne which sold
Red Barrel on our last night!
If you think that you would like to
spend three weeks camping, walking
and generally enjoying yourself —
all for about £50 why not join ICYHA?
Does anyone fancy Scandinavia for
next summer?
The group is planning to visit
Cheddar, Dartmoor, Cader Idris and
Malham in the Autumn term. There
will be a coffee evening and slideshow
at the beginning of term to publicize
these events.
The following will be pleased to
provide further information about the
groups' activities:

The Photographic Society is
one of the College's largest
societies and as such can offer
a wide variety of activities to
it's members. Some of the
meetings arranged for this
year are John McGovren and
lan Ball FRPS talking about
their photography, darkroom
demonstrations for both begin-
ners and experienced members,
a portrait session, a chance to
see some 3-D slides yourself
and many more .
The Society has two dark-
rooms of it's own which can be
booked in advance, there is an
annual competition with cash
prizes. We run a shop selling
materials, if we don't stock
what you want we can order it
for you at our special discount
prices. Also there is our Colour
Group where you can do
Unicolor/Kodak prints.
If you want to join, see us
at the Fresher's Fair, either in
one of the darkrooms or in the
Union. If you miss that, you
are welcome to come and see
me in Falmouth Hall, Room 113.
Photsoc doesn't just benefit
it's members; from this term
we will do team photos, etc.
for Union organisations in
colour or black and white at
very reasonable prices, come
and discuss it with us.
