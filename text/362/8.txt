Having three Constituent
Colleges as well as IC Union
means we have got three times
as many mascots as other Col—
legesi/Universities, — and so
three times as many to be
nicked . F E L I X thought that it
would be a good idea to have
a mascots' get-together. The
idea was to have a l l the C C U
and ICU mascots and Presidents
past and present on show. The
first problem was that Guilds,
did not bring Spanner their
mascot . They had had it nicked
so many times that year and so
did not feel safe in bringing it
along . Instead thay brought a
two-inch replica of Spanner
(seen on B o ' s bonnet).
City & Guilds had also been
repairing I C ' s long-lost mascot,
M i k e . Claiming that it was not
ready and still bore scars of
its visit to Queen Mary College
they had not brought Mike .
C&G were not the only C C U
to field a weakened team . Last
year's President of RCSU, M .
Turner, had resigned the day
before and had forgotten to tell
this year's President, Pete
Teague to come along . Other-
wise! a l l I C ' s mascots were
there.
Even then the whole event
did not pass off as planned .
With a l l the photographs taken,
C&G decided that Theta, an
RCS mascot, should be nicked.
L i k e many similar attempts
last year, it failed miserably.
But then mascotry has always
been characterised by things
getting nicked. I C ' s first mas-
cot, a phoenix named Herbert
(after Herbet G . Wells, who was
once a student at this college),
was no exception to the rule.
Churchill College Cambridge
had managed to steal him in
1964. Unable to recover him,
a Union meeting contemptuous-
ly decide to donate Herbert to
the same college.
Two years later I C U
devised another mascot, Mike .
It is a four-foot long, 170lb
working model of a micrometer
screw guage. Designed in R C S ,
cast in Mines and machined in
Guilds, Mike became regarded
as one of the best mascots ever
made. Hence stringent (ho!
ho!) were made to ensure that
it remained in I C ' s possession.
Alas, Mike has been nicked
on many occasions. First by
University College in D e c e m -
ber 1966, then by Kings in
June 1968 and most recently
by Queen Mary College in
January 1970. L a s t year saw
Mike return to IC, thanks to the
efforts of Dave Sinclair, and it
was on display at the AGM in
June.
Turning to the C C U ' s , a l l
three have vintage motorised
and inviolate mascots. R C S
have a 1916 Dennis Fire Engine
called Jezebel. This they have
restored to working order (des-
pite last year's encounter with
a skip) and Jez makes many
trips each year — notably the
Rag Procession and the Comm-
ercial Vehicle Run.
Guilds Vintage car is a
1902 James & Browne tonneau
called Boanerges, Bo for short.
Bo usually takes part in the
London to Brighton run and last
won five cups in the Manches-
ter to Blackpool run. Mines
Mines originally had a
traction engine, Clementine I
astheirmotorised mascot. This
was replaced several years ago
by an old lorry painted in the
cllege colours, called Clem II.
Accompanying Jez and Bo
are two lovely ladies, the
Queen of Jez and B o Belle.
The Q of J is the most beautiful
girl fresher in R C S (chosen at
the first R C S UGM) and Bo
Belle is likewise in Guilds
and is chosen in January.
Both these girls sit on their
respective vehicles and adorn
them everywhere they go. Both
are also inviolate mascots.
Each C C U has a number of
violatejnascots, which " d i s -
appear" every now and again.
RCS have Theta, a giant 70lb
thermometer, painted in R C S
colours and this has so far
proven to be un-nickable.
Guilds have two very large
and very heavy items called
Spanner and Bolt. Spanner i s
raised above the President's
head at the end of their Union
meetings.
Mines have perhaps the best
violate mascot in the form of
a large Davy lamp, seen left.
Last year saw the revival of
the Wooden Horse Organisation
and the Co-Ordinator this year
is Dave Sinclair (Physics III).
