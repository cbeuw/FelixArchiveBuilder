No. 362
MONDAY 30th SEPTEMBER 1974
REFECTORY PRICES
UP 17 PERCENT
ON THE last day of the previous College Session, the Board
of Governors of Imperial College consented to rises in refect-
ory prices across the board to the extent of a staggering 17Vi%.
Despite urgent pleas for a subsidy by the Union delegation at
the meeting, the College felt that it had no choice in the matter.
The atmosphere at the Board
of Governors was sympathetic
yet uncompromising.
Could College give the
refectories a subsidy? This
would be impossible under the
University Grants Committee
(UGC) from which IC gets most
of its money.
Does College have any
money of its own that it could
use instead? 'College has
substantial reserves, but they
refuse to use this money,
directly in the interests of
students, despite our (the
Union's) view that this kind of
demand should be a major
priority', said the Union
President, Mr. Trevor Phillips.
The two-point plan which
the delegation suggested was
as follows:
1. Short term. Let the increases
be only 10% and supply the
refectory with a subsidy.
2. Lone term. The Governors
should lobby collectively and
individually the UGC for a
relaxation of the imposing
restrictions regarding for what
UGC money can and cannot be
used.
The plan was countered by
Mr. M.J. Davies, Secretary to
the College, who firmly stated
that UGC rules are inflexible:
'The books must balance;
there can be no subsidies'.
There was no area for
compromise. No Governor
raised his or her voice in
support of the Union's plan.
Nothing could be done.
Copulation: A
Discipline Offence

of HSMU Paul Gee clearly thought that ICU ought to clean up
?ts hnaee So in me early hours of Tuesday, 18th June, as one
OT Jofnt Council was coming to a laborious conclusion, Paul
proposed that Fornication on
Union premises should be a
discipline offence". Before
many of the steadily diminish-
ing number of Council members
could awaken themselves, a
speech for and against the
motion had been heard. In a
last ditch effort to defend the
permissiveness and personal
freedom of this modern society,
Mike Williams proposed an
amendment to the effect that
"Fornication should be encour~-
aged, not discouraged, on Union
premises".. This amendment
was tragically defeated, and on
a vote, the original motion was
passed.
Certainly, the implications
of this motion are clear: To all
budding Romeos and egotists,
"If you want to do it, do it
elsewhere, not on the Union
premises — or the Deputy Pres-
ident will have it in for you" .
Undoubtedly, i ^ f d l l be very
interesting to seevWat punish-
ment is given out to the- first
offending couple. Even more
|,intriguing is that fornication is
is an offence whilst presumably
copulation is not. No doubt
there will be some red—faced
when the first married couple
is caught doing it in the Union.
