Summer "success
To be read to an Accompaniment of the Trumpet Jamaica, or other
music with a suitable sense of occasion.
This is the tale of a most amazing event which happened at
the end of Jane. For, about then, Wye College were holding
their Second Annual Summer Relay, and six of us has travelled
to the far side of Kent to take
part. To avoid the heat of the
sun (which in those days was
still known to shine) and the
World Cup, the start had been
planned for early in the evening:
however, the dressing rooms
having been mislaid, it was
not until nearly seven o'clock
that the race got under way.
And when it did, who should
return leading the first lap by
some 600 yards but our own
Rob Allinson. This was the
cause of some consternation
(quote: 'Oh, * / & - { £ * !') to
those who had to follow him,
and not a few giggles. The
coarse found its way through
some strawberry fields and
cherry orchards, past some
smelly hens and some equally
noticable cows, across a
field growing rocks and finished
with a sprint down the village
high street: it was round
this two-and-a-bit miles that
Neil Boag and Ian Isherwood
then saw the unusual sight of
Dave Jones setting off on the
last leg a whole minute in
front of the rest of the' field
However, by the end of the
lap, the situation had changed
dramatically with Dave app-
earing round the last bend
only five yards ahead, and
it looked all set for an all out.
sprint to the line. Sadly, due
to Italians in the control
room, the actual finish became
mislaid; however, it is rum-
oured that, for the first time
in years (apart from the odd
(very odd) friendly match) we
finally won a race. Just. Won...
Came first even-. We also
D. A. Jones
came third in the shape of our
second team (Alf Garnett, Pete
Johnson, and Rob and Neil
again) relying once more on
Rob to move us up the field
and this time on Neil for the
sprint finish. This was all
something of a surprise —
unfortunately there were no
prizes, Wye having found a
better use for the entrance
fees. Later there was yet
another incident at Ashford,
while some remained in Wye
sampling the local approx-
imation to Real Ale.
