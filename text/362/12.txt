The recently premiered film Bird
On A Wire' depicts Leonard Cohen's
last tour — his 'farewell' tour. Friday
September 20th, saw the appearance
of a far from retired Mr. Cohen at the
Royal Albert Hall.
After greeting the backing music ians
— bassist John Miller (strangely clad
in a bowler hat and black suit and
looking more like an undertaker),
guitarist Jeff Layton, musical director
cum pianist John Lissauer, and
vocalists Emily Bindinger and Erin
Dickens — the audience warmly
applauded the appearance of a grey-
suited Mr. Cohen .
His more melancholic and sensual
songs, including 'Bird on a Wire',
'Sisters of Mercy', and 'So Long.
Marianne' were performed with a
tuneful confidence and skillfully
backed by his musicians, although I
thought the initial sounds were rather
hol low.
It rather disappoints me that all
Mr. Cohen's songs are so depressing.
A man of 40 should surely come to
grips with his problems (whatever
they may be). Many songs sti 11 contain
an overdose of self-pity. Perhaps the
answer is that the audience reaction
to such songs does nothing to
discourage them.
After the break we were treated
to a Cohen solo which included the
new Chelsea Hotel' — an elegy about
a friend who he once met in this New
York hoteI.
The band's reappearance heralded
the start of a more healthy selection
of new songs (from the recent album
New Skin For The Old Ceremony'),
along, of course, with the old
favourites. We were treated to a
superbly mellow saxophone solo by
John Layton. A weIcome theme-change
came with another new song, 'There
Is A War'. Written for the Israeli
soldiers in the Sinai Desert during
his 1973 visit, the song — with a
catchy reggae rhythm — examines
what it is to be Jewish.
Only the end of the set after 90
minutes brought the appreciative but
quiet audience to its feet. The scene,
however, quickly became more than
a little ludicrous. Four encores and
eight songs later, when the auditoruim
lights came on, it seemed that the
concert had finished. Apparently not
satisfied and possibly going for a
new world record, Mr. Cohen reappeared
for the fifth time, (this time on his
own), sang a final song and shook a
few hands before finally leaving.
To me, all this seemed to be an
overdose of ego-tripping.
Nevertheless, I am sure that Mr.
Cohen lost a few but gained many
admirers by this performance. I
remain unconvinced.

BEE GEES - CHARADE
(R.S.O. Records).
This is the sort of record that should
get to the top of any singles chart.
But it won't. It's a beautiful slow
ballad by those old masters Robin and
Barry Gibb. But it's too slow to become
a smoochie' disco or radio hit like
Albatross' and 'Je t'aime'. Nor does
it have the kind of catchy tune or
hypnotic beat, that characterises most
of the 'manufactured' records, that are
churned out regularly by some record
companies. It's this lack of beat or
catchy tune that will make it a relatively
unattractive buy to the 'hypnotised'
buying public. I
n fact the B side 'Heavy
Breathing' would do much better as far
as chart success goes. The only people
I can see buying this record are devoted
Bee Gees fans but they'll probably be
tempted to get the album 'Mr. Natural',
from which these two songs are taken.
So a fine record from a talented group,
and some fine production to go with it.
Sad to say it'll only be a hit if it gets
extended air play on Radio One or
Capitol Radio.

BEST OF MY LOVE
The record business, is very cut-throat
at the moment, and with material like
this, John Lees and his band cannot
expect to last long. The song is nice
and pleasant, in fact quite quaint.
But it simply does not have the charisma
that will separate it from all the other
singles and make it a hit. The record
is really too long for a hit single and
becomes obnoxious and tedious about
half-way through. Although this record
is very much in the mould of records
played on Capital Radio, it doesn't
stand much chance of becoming a hit.
