WITH WELL over 4,000 students, Imperial College is as large
as a number of provincial Universities, and although only a
college of London University, provides facilities for a wide
range of sporting activities. Despite the rumours that the academic
work-load is enormous, the College has maintained a tradition of
a high standard in sport. In
fact, looking back over the
years, it is possible to see,
although there have been
localised fluctuations in
fortunes, a continuous increase
in the standard of sporting
achievement in all of theclubs.
The majority of students
spend only three years at I.C.
(though some manage longer
stays; and it can be done both
by passing and failing exams)
and-of those three years, the
last one finds most students
increasing the work/play ratio,
and so all sports clubs are
heavily dependent on a large
intake of freshers every year
to maintain their numbers.
So do not imagine that a s a
fresher you are trying to break
into some sort of established
clique in the club or clubs of
your choice; all the sports
clubs are desperately keen to
have you join, no matter what
standard you may personally
have attained. There is plenty
of scope at Imperial for the
Olympic oarsman as well as
the coarse-rugby player, or
possibly the other way round.
Trie sports clubs, which
include association football,
boat, basketball, badminton,
cricket, croquet, cross-country,
fencing, golf, hockey, judo,
karate, lacrosse, lawn tennis,
rifle and pistol, rugby football,
sailing, ski, squash, swimming,
table tennis, ten-pin bowling,
volley ball and yacht are
heavily subsidised by the
Union to the tune of about
£10,000 for this coming year.
This means that membership
fees are extremely low and
equipment and expert tuition
are available. Travel to away
fixtures is subsidised and
clubs are able to go on tour,
not only in this country but
abroad as well. These tours
are very often the highlight
of the particular club's act-
ivities for the year.
The sports facilities are
divided between three centres,
the gymnasium on the 2nd
floor of the Union, the sports
centre in Princes Gardens and
the sports ground at Harlington
(near Heathrow). The sports
centre contains the squash
courts which are available
to non-members for most of
the time (booking for the
Once again we find ourselves at the start of another College
rowing season. Both the success and failures of last season are
behind us and we hope that the year ahead will produce only
success. You, whether freshman, undergrad, or postgrad, can
contribute to the success by coming along to the Boat House in
Putney on Wednesday, 2nd
October at 2.30 p.m. or by
coming along to the Boat
Club stall on Freshers' day.
It doesn't matter whether
you are 6' 6 " and weigh
200lbs or 5' 6 " and weigh
100lbs, we can find a place
for you. No previous ex-
perience is needed. There
is a bar attached to the boat-
house and this alone makes
it a pleasant place to spend
Saturday mornings and
Wednesday afternoons. So
if you feel like a change
from conventional school
sports, come along and try
rowing; you may never get
