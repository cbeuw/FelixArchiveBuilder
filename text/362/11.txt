AFFAIRS
CORNER
Tom Abraham
TO THE freshers, on behalf
of all the postgraduates, I bid
a warm welcome to Imperial
College, and I hope your stay
at I.C., whether for one year
or three years will be a success
both socially and academically.
The postgraduates have a
group known as the Imperial
College postgraduate group
(ICPGG). This group is res-
ponsible for the welfare,
educational and otherwise,
of postgraduates in the college.
It is run by a committee con-
sisting of chairman (myself),
secretary, treasurer, and
departmental reps. We hope to
make Imperial College a better
place for postgraduates to live
and work in. However, we can
only do this with the co-
operation and active par-
tici| >
f all the PG's at
the co.'t^e. So far this has
not been readily forthcoming,
but I hope you the freshers
will change this state of
affairs, so that you can help
us to help you.
The summer is over and our
peace and quiet will soon be
disturbed by hordes of under-
grads. On reflection it may not
be such a bad thing, as there
should be now an improvement
in college facilities, which
were withdrawn from us in
order to cater for conferences

Weekly classes in Hatha Yoga, following the methods
of Mr. Iyengar, author of 'Light on Yoga', willcommence
on Tuesday 1st October, 1974, from 5.30 to 7.00 p.m.,
in the Common Room, Department of Physics, Level 8.
Hatha Yoga is a practical way to attain a healthy body,
together with a relaxed but disciplined mind, through
the regular practice of traditional Yoga exercises.

and exhibitions.
Towards the end of August,
the SRC in their infinite wisdom
decided, to postpone our grants
for three months. Rumblings
of discontent reached my ears,
whereupon I reported to Trev
Phillips (our beloved leader)
that there was unrest among
the 'peasants'. He took the
matter up with John Randall
(our redeemer) who immediately
wrote to Reg Prentice demanding
that this decision be reversed.
Uncle Reg did his conkers,
because apparently neither he
nor the DES knew anything
about it, and with an election
in the offing and with post-
graduates and others .(i.e.
undergrads) able to swing the
vote in certain marginal
constituencies (i.e. South
Kensington), this was just not
on. Within the hour the Research
councils led by the SRC
surrended. It was a glorious
victory in the battle against
bureaucracy.
Finally, on a more serious
note, it is union policy that all
turoring and demonstrating
jobs be fully advertised to all
postgraduates within each
department. If any departments
are failing to advertise these
jobs, then the matter will have
to be taken up with the college
authorities.
