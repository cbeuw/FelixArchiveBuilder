At the beginning of February adverts appeared in RCS Broad-
sheet and Guildsheet advertising a new form of media that would
solve all your problems at a stroke (Sorry folks). A week later a
tetter from five first and second year students appeared in F E L I X .
Thus IC Campus Radio Society was launched, and now seven
months later, we look forward
to doing battle with the Home
Office — the final hurdle
standing between us and our
radio licence.
So by next February we will
be broadcasting twenty-five
hours a week of programmes to
Southside and Linstead Halls.
A little later the service will
be extended to Weeks, Garden
and Beit Hall. Eventually,
(come a couple of years) IC
Radio should cover the Student
Halls and flats as well
(hopefully!).
IC Radio will be on the
medium wave band around 300
metres. You'll be able to pick
it up on a radio anywhere in
the halls of residence.
Unlike Felix IC Radio will
be able to provide an up to
date news service. Unlike
STOIC, ICR will be broad-
casting in the evenings and at
the weekends when commerical
and B B C stations are not
broadcasting student-orientated
programmes. Added to which
it's much easier to produce a
radio programme than a TV
programme or a newspaper.
Whilst IC Radio will not be
trying to drive either medium
into obsolecence; it will fill a
gap in the IC media which has
up to now been lacking. One
of its main tasks will be to
give SCAB organisations a
cl.ance to introduce more
people to their activities. IC
Radio will have close contact
with its listeners so that you
get the service that you want.
We soon hope to get our
licence application back from
the Home Office. Then we can
set up the aerial side of the
system. Test transmissions
should start around November
and the studio will be built as
soon as the Home Office gives
us a full licence. To set up
the station we will need people
to help. If you would like to be
part of this new society or are
just interested to see what
it'll be like, come along to the
Freshers' Fair tomorrow. We
will be there doing 'dummy'
programmes, to give you an
idea of what your radio station
will sound like. So come and
see us in the Union Concert
Hall. Or else, see either
myself (Linstead 528) or Mike
Elgey (Linstead 334), John
Allen (Falmouth 113), Huw
Saunders or Steve Brightman
(both Physics 2).

This has gone up because of increased cost
of meals.
All the other prices are the same for the

erences for fees of guests.
These rents may well go up in January
when the Rent Freeze ends.

WORKING FOR FELIX CAN GET VERY
HECTIC AT TIMES, BUT IF THAT IS THE
SORT OF THING YOU WANT, PLUS THE
SATISFACTION OF HAVING ACTUALLY
PRODUCED A NEWSPAPER, THEN LOOK
US UP AT EITHER THE FELIX OFFICE
NEAR THE UNION ARCHWAY) OR AT THE
RESHERS'S FAIR (IN THE UNION OFFICE).

Many thanks to Kyrle, Valerie. Catherine,
Clive, Ramon,and Paul.
Special thanks to Jim for giving me a good
space-filler,Trev for getting his presidential
in only two days late and for letting me
borrow somtz cassette tapes in order to
restore my sanity.
PS. In the interests of fair play, the idea
of calling the presidential "Preci Pice"
is in fact due to Shirley Fairweather.
