j I • -p* • ~~~ On Monday, October 7th, ICWA are holding their Annual
e J U l i a J J U n n i n g (Freshers) Dinner. To the uninitiated ICWA is the Imperial
College Women's Association. Everything but everything is
T f ' W A ' P T , i i o i r l O T | f known by initials in College, but you soon get used to it — make
-*-v^ tY A J r r t i a l Q C I l L U p a few of your own, no-one will notice the difference! The
you know this girl? This
picture, taken during Rag week
last year has us stumped . We
have not a clue who she is .
Anyone who might know the
identity of this fair maiden is
invited to ring Int .2881 .
dinner is specially arranged
at this time of year to
coincide with the arrival
of new students in college.
It is the first of the dinners
and the only one drawing
people from all over college
— and that includes staff
as well as students. I
should like to point out too
that anyone is free to buy
a ticket — man or woman,
but numbers are limited, so
if you do wish to come,
make sure you get your
ticket early (details for
getting a ticket are at the
foot of this article).
This year we are making
a particular effort to make
this different from the 'run
of the mill' college dinner.
Included in this is the late
bar extension and the fact
that we have a cabaret
afterwards (usually reserved
for the big 'formal' dinner-
dances in college). The
cabaret will be folk singer
Stan Arnold, who has made
numerous television app-
earances. He is also very
funny. Wine should be
flowing relatively freely
and at all ICWA functions,
there are coincidently
always womenl So, I feel
justified in using the above
headline .
I hope you will come to
the dinner — I certainly
think it will be worth it for
anyone, 1st, 2nd or 3rd year
student. Though, of course,
I am slightly biased in my
opinion.
For those particularly
eager to acquire tickets,
ICWA is giving a Freshers'
Tea on Freshers' Fair day,
starting at 2.30 p.m. There
will be free tea and food
for those who make it early
enough ! A Iso, Lady Flowers,
our Vice-President, will be
there together with Lady
Anne Thorne, the Senior
Tutor for Woman. If any of
you have any teething
problems, please come along
and if we cannot help you
directly then we can certainly
putyou in touch with someone
who can.
Finally, I should just like
to give a quick summary of
what we shall be doing later
in the term. The nearest
date to tell you of is the
31 st of October — Hal I owe 'en.
We will be laying on a
Masked Ball with folk
singers, Ceilidh band,
'bobbingapples' competition,
with something extra special
for 12 midnight, the Witching
Hour! A l l to be washed down
with a good old traditional
Witch's Brew (alcoholic, of
courser).. Something not to
be missed. (I mean the B a l l ,
as well as the drink!). I
hope you can make it.
%Various lunch parties
will also be laid on later in
the term, and we will be
putting on something during
Rag Week — including making
a collection.
Really, we shall be doing
loads this year and with
your support, everything will
turn out successful.
Well, that's all I've got
to say — except enjoy your-
selves, and if you are worried
about something, or want to
know something in particular
about college, I am always
glad to help.

Scratches mark the paintwork of the heavy, white oak door.
A last angry kick and it's back into the world. Along the empty
corridor where I so often dashed in at five to nine, scattering
papers, pinning up notices, avoiding anyone poised as if ready
to detain me, and then slinking in at the back to lectures,
conspicuously inconspicousV
late as usual. The very corridor
where we decided who was
going to be who in the next
union, where half the arrange-
ments for the celebrated revue
were made (Ziegfield would
have been proud of us). Ah!
those were the days. Now,with
a ring of the bell, presents
and prizes distributed and
addresses swopped, I.F. is
disbanded. Not one footstep
will resound in the place for
another eleven weeks. Dust
will gather on the drinks
machine and the empty Gaulolse
packets will lie untouched.
But what will happen to us
professional students, left to
fend for ourselves in the nasty
world of money-making? Those
for whom the college is a big
comfy armchair, a refuge. Only
here can one sit back and
appreciate life at it's best.
Where else could you covert
under the lights other than at
Mines' disco, sample some of
the finest cuisine north of
Dino's (gourmet gathering every*
evening at 6.30 in Southside),
climb the Bell Tower (silly me,,
what a giveaway!) and compete
in the one o'clock sprint to
Florries' 'sandwich bar (current
title holder for the 200 yards,
A. Humphries in 25 seconds)?
You may well ask.
Now if a student can be
roughly described as 'long-
haired and between the ages
of 18 and 25', it is not because
most students are long-haired
and in that age range but
because we create that
impression. The truth of the
matter is that university is a
sort of shangri-la. How many
students do you know suffering
from old age? Which really
goes to prove my theory. Hair
after all, being a sign of youth
(sadly admits my father, still
mourning the loss of his last
remaining strands). It is not
until our bright university grad
finally leaves that age begins
to show. With paper degree
clutched in one clammy hand
and ticket to what the French
so aptly describe as 'metro,
boulot, metro, dodo' (bus,
business, bus, bed) in the
other, he steps out into his
oyster. Wham, the clam closes.
Lines form, hair greys,
cheeks sink. Mortgage,
insurance, teething, school
fees: everything hacks away
at his weak defences. Another
good man gone to the dogs.
Never mind, close the ranks,
bring in the freshers. And
so it goes on.
I.F.—' French Institute
to the plebs and Institut
Francais to everyone else —
is situated in Cromwell
Place opposite a public
house of equal ill repute
known as the Hoop and Toy .
I.F. can be easily picked
out by its peeling walls and
general look of neglect. Do
not be fooled. Inside are
250 lovely ladies all doing
either a one, two or three
bi-lingual secretarial course,
in some cases speaking
Spanish, German or Russian
too. A l l distinguished by
the fact that none of them
intend to be secretaries
(sit tapping at a machine all
day and vowing undying
subservice to a mere male,
you can't be serious!). Some
being frustrated biologists
and scientists, some frus-
trated archeologists and
anthropologists and some
frustrated.
Dare to penetrate within
the imposing facade of 13a.
Cromwell Mews (our Union
office) and you will have
conquered an all-female
stronghold — but will be
very welcome none the less.
Drop in any time as long as
it's between one and one
thirty ('fraid so). Now you
must excuse me while I dash
off. I have an appointment
with my ideological master.
