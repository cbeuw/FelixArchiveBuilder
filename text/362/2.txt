1 FELIX
Mike Williams
AS T H E Freshers inevitably begin to
invade Imperial College, the Union
perfunctorily has to sit down and consider
the overwhelming multitude of problems,
both large and small, important and
trivial which it faces.
The majority of these problems have
one aspect irrefutably in common: They
are recurrent. It is pretentious to consider
them as anything else. Looking back over
past FELICES, there are a countless
number of issues where the principal
topic i s refectory prices, or student
accommodation etc. Just as every year
these problems arise, so there is a new
Union administration to launch enth-
usiastically an attack on them. Proper
solutions are pie-in-the-sky stuff for they
would take too many crispy £££'s. The
Union's brief then i s to search out the
common ground that might exist between
itself and the body that presents the
problem, and to fight for a compromise.
Demanding a solution i s a naivety in the
extreme.
Not surprisingly, the ICU Executive
have their own specialised problems at
the beginning of the year; each essentially
has his or her 'Baptism by Fire'. The
President has reams of speeches to write,
dialogues to maintain, protocol to suffer;
the Deputy President's piece de resistance
is the Freshers' Fair; the Hon. Secretary's
lot i s undoubtedly the Parking Applic-
ations Committee where by it is her task
to tell 193 applicants that they have
been successful and to inform the
estimated remainder of 400 that they
have been unsuccessful. Then there i s
the Parking Applications Appeals
Committee...
On the subject of Baptism by Fire',
this Freshers' issue of F E L I X has been
a huge pain to produce, due to the
simple fact that material suddenly flooded
the office on copy day. Jeez, what a
mess! I can only express my intense
envy of past Editors who simply had to
get the copy together, edit it and send
it off to the printers with appropriate
instruction. Period. End of committment
Nowadays one has to get the type act-
ually set, cut out the master copy, glue
it to a sheet (neatly and straight without
getting any glue smudges on it) and
'composing' a lay-out to fill the pages.
Then it's off to the litho-operator to make
the plate and run it off on the machine.
Finally comes the folding, collating and
distribution. Still, what the hell.
To those freshers who might be
interested in the production of F E L I X ,
come along to either the F E L I X Office
(near the Union Archway) or to the stall
in the New Union Office at Freshers.
N.B. It looks good on any job application
form to say that one has worked on a
student's newspaper.
N.B. We will be producing a mid-week
FELIX SPECIAL, to appear next
Thursday. Copy date for this issue will
be Tuesday midday. The copy date for the
next FELIX proper will be Thursday
3rd October. Small Adds can be accepted
at ANY time depending on the space
available.

Dear Sir,
For the benefit of new PGs
we'd like to fill in some of the
background to the recently
announced demonstrating
rates of £2 per hour. Less
than 18 months ago most
departments were paying £1
per contact hour. The exceptions
being Physics — where many
PGs belonged to an A.S.T.M.S.
Union branch, and had neg-
otiated a higher rate tied to
the Junior Lecturer's pay
scale — and Maths who received
£1.50. Around this time the
I.C. Postgraduate Group was
formed with a policy of en-
couraging strong departmental
and laboratory based groups.
It was these groups in Chemistry,
Physics, Maths, Metallurgy
and Geology who provided the
impetus for the campaign on
demonstrating rates. Before
the general announcement of
£1.50 throughout the College,
Metallurgy, in particular, and
later Geology were engaged
in departmental struggles to
win higher rates. Only after
Metallurgy Postgrads had made
it abundantly clear that they
were prepared to withdraw
their labour, did the depart-
ment concede an increase to
£1.50. It was in this context
of Postgraduate militancy in
several departments that
college wide increases were
announced.
In his article in the last
copy of Felix, Tom Abraham
(Post. Grad. Affairs Officer)
refers to intermittent ne-
gotiations with the college —
he should perhaps have put
negotiations in invertedcommas
Postgraduate students play
vital roles in the running of
the college — a fact which is
recognised more clearly by
the Administration than by
many P G s . Where P G s have
organised in their departments
many improvements' "in con-
ditions of work have been won.
Your department probably
has a P G group — if not, why
not form one. Members of the
established groups will be
glad to help. Tom Abraham
should not accuse P G s of
apathy (even if it's true at.the
present), but should point out
what they can achieve by
concerted effort.
