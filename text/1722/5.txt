A Policy View of Abortion
The ethics behind abortion have been debated over and over. Think about it policy-wise
instead.

L
ast week, the
Alabama State
legislature ap-
proved a bill that
would limit a woman’s
access to abortion at every
stage of pregnancy and
make it a criminal offence
for doctors who provide
the service. This measure
has been the most dras-
tic move by American
pro-lifers to challenge a
woman’s right to choose
to end her own pregnan-
cy; whereas recent bills
passed by other states to
restrict abortion access
have included exceptions
for pregnancies caused by
rape and incest,Alabama’s
has no such concessions.
The Republican law-
makers who authored
this bill are well-aware
of its extremity. Indeed,
they are hoping that the
unconstitutional nature of
their proposal can bring
the ethos of abortion back
into the Supreme Court’s
deliberations.
The abortion debate is
multi-faceted. Whether
or not one views abortion
as morally acceptable
does not always dictate
whether they think it
should be always legal.
And of course, religious
belief, the weighing of a
mother’s right to bodily
autonomy against the
fetus’ right to life, the
scientific determination
of when life begins,
fetal viability are all
factors lumped into the
discussion. In America,
however, the public
discourse only revolves
around and agonises
over a 1973 landmark
decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court, Roe
v. Wade, which estab-
lishes that a woman’s
decision of abortion is
protected by her right to
privacy. And since this
ruling, there has been
an unrelenting effort
by conservatives to try
and overthrow the legal
precedent established
by Roe. It seems, like
most issues in America,
this is a little too deeply
embedded in cultural
and partisan divides for
actual policy discussions
around it to surface and
be taken seriously.
The anti-abortion
argument is simple and
uncomplicated, as its
basis is mostly in the
religious belief that
life begins at concep-
tion when God creates
us in the womb, and
because abortion in
even the earliest stages
of pregnancy would
be to end that life,
abortion is effectively
murder. The case for
allowing abortion is
understandably less easy
to argue for, there isn’t
a straightforward way
to capture the implied
beliefs of what pro-
choice is in a similarly
cohesive manner. My
perspective, at least, is
that pro-choice policies
implicitly demand social
trust in pregnant women
to be well-informed of
their options and their
respective outcomes,
and that they do not
abuse the freedom of
choice through irre-
sponsible and reckless
behavior.
Nonetheless, believ-
ing in pro-choice comes
hand-in-hand with
demanding increased
availability of sexual ed-
ucation, contraceptives,
and family planning,
which would decrease
the rate of unwanted
pregnancies that con-
tribute to a significant
percentage of abortions.
Because fundamen-
tally, nobody actually
believes that abortion is
good if it is unnecessary.
Advocating for women
to be given this choice
is not synonymous with
the casual disregard
for a fetus, nor does it
represent an encour-
agement for women to
disregard contraceptives
and be careless about
pregnancy, nor a disre-
spect for one’s religion;
instead, it is simply an
understanding that, for
the greater good of a
woman’s freedom to
choose abortion should
be an available choice,
and that other policies
can be made to tackle
the reasons why one
might require abortion
as an option.
I’ve mentioned some
of those policies – family
planning and contracep-
tives – and to further
this argument let’s say
we’ve perfected those
policies but, because
accidents happen, the
woman gets pregnant
anyway. Since women
can’t just magically
un-pregnant themselves
(which would definite-
ly be preferable over
abortion), it then makes
sense that the option of
abortion is an option
women should have. No
woman sees abortion as
an inherently pleasing,
diseased children, so
that they don’t see the
disability/disease as a
burden heavy enough to
deter them from having
the child at all.
As for Alabama and
Roe v. Wade, it currently
seems unlikely that their
bill will be brought to
the Supreme Court. If
they do decide to take on
this issue next year (the
Court operates on a sort
of cycle where judicial
orders and opinions are
released around June
every year), the outcome
will have significant in-
fluence over the looming
2020 elections. Regard-
less, the most effective
solution for either side
of the American public
is also the simplest:
vote.

attractive process to
put themselves through;
women who choose
abortion do so because
they believe it is what’s
best when compared
to the alternatives they
face: being financially
unable to support the
child, having to raise the
child alone, knowledge
that the child will be
born with physical or
mental health complica-
tions. Restricted access
to abortion is not at all
a policy that addresses
the root of their problem
that led them to choose
abortion. Instead, solu-
tions should improve
the ability of the welfare
state to support low-in-
come or single-parent
households in raising
a child, and even more
support for parents
