Vita & Virginia Review

S
ometimes called
the longest
love-letter in
history, Virginia
Woolf wrote Orlando,
the fictional biography of
a gender-bending, time
travelling Elizabethan
nobleman, as a trib-
ute to her friend, and
sometimes-lover, Vita
Sackville-West. Based to
a great extent on the letters
that the two acclaimed
novelists wrote each other
over twenty years, director
Chanya Button’s film, Vita
and Virginia, explores the
complex relationship the
two women shared, and
the conception of Woolf’s
seminal novel.
Ostensibly a period
piece, beginning with
the meeting between
Sackville-West (Gemma
Arterton) and Woolf (Eliz-
abeth Debicki) in 1922,
the Vita and Virginia
attempts to take a page out
of Sofia Coppola’s 2006
biopic, Marie Antoinette.
It is to the beat of synth
heavy electronica that
Vita and Virginia’s eyes
meet across a smoke filled
dancefloor. Whilst Isobel
Waller-Bridge’s musical
interjections bring
urgency to the narrative
and serve to highlight the
modernism of thought and
sensibility amongst the
the Bloomsbury Group
to which both Sackville-
West and Woolf belonged.
This is not mirrored by
the rest of the film which
remains resolutely staid.
In antithesis to Button’s
2015 debut, Burn Burn
Burn, Vita and Virginia
has a curiously stilted
quality, particularly as the
first meeting gives way
to exposition. This is no
small part to its heavy
reliance on lifting words
directly from the letters
that the two novelists
wrote each other. “I am
reduced to a thing that
wants Virginia” wrote
Sackville-West to Woolf
in one such exchange. On
the page these letters are
electrifyingly passionate;
as dialogue, they become
heavy, and overwrought,
losing something of their
brilliance. Eileen Atkins
originally developed Vita
and Virginia as a play, and
here, the script adapted by
Atkins and Button for film
still clings to the vestiges
of the stage.
Debicki and Arterton
take turns to perform the
“It is to
the beat of
synth heavy
electronica
that Vita and
Virginia’s eyes
meet across a
smoke filled
dancefloor.”
“The film
occupies the
grey middle
ground
between a
character
study, and
a period
romance
without quite
committing to
being either.”
text directly to us, the
viewer, their faces par-
tially obscured by gauzy,
soft-focus camerawork.
Delivered in this way, the
letters come across not
as lovelorn confessionals
but as performative mon-
ologues. It is easy to see
how this would’ve been
successful in a theatre,
but on film, the lack of
naturalism serves only to
create distance with the
audience.
Vita and Virginia hits
its stride in its latter third
when the two protagonists
come together as lovers,
spending their nights in
Vita’s ancestral home,
Sissinghurst Castle,
which will later form
the setting of Orlando.
Their brief romance is
tender, propelled by the
chemistry between the
lead actresses who lend
enormous charisma to
their roles. Arterton is
winsomely flirtatious, yet
retains a chink of coldness
that manifests itself later
in the film. Debicki is
luminous in a vulnerable
portrayal of Virginia; rail
thin, holding her body
with awkward tension,
she looms over Arterton,
capturing a sense of being
entirely otherworldly.
When the two are apart,
the movie flags. The
supporting cast includes
a roster of stars including
they are given precious
little to do other than push
Vita and Virginia together,
or endeavour to keep them
apart. We are often told of
the scandalous free spirit-
edness of the Bloomsbury
Group, yet seldom see this
for ourselves beyond catty
exchanges over painting
sessions and raunchy
dancing at parties.
The undercurrents
of tension between
Sackville-West’s aris-
tocratic upbringing and
Woolf’s middle class
socialist background
are left relatively un-
explored. Any mention
of the former’s own,
wildly successful writing
career quickly falls by
the wayside. Perhaps
most crucially, the movie
doesn’t know quite what
to do with Woolf’s ailing
mental health; in lieu
of nuanced dialogue,
Button opts for fantastical
allegory. Long strands of
ivy threaten to overwhelm
her whenever Virginia
feels anxious; during
a panic attack a vast
cloud of crows plummet
towards Virginia’s head as
she cowers in the garden.
These superficial render-
ings do not do justice to
Woolf whose life’s work
was an articulation of
things hidden beneath the
surface.
Vita and Virginia is a
visually beautiful film,
filled with wide, sweeping
landscapes and moodily
lit interiors shot by
Carlos De Carvalho, but
we are left uncertain of
Button’s intentions. The
film occupies the grey
middle ground between
a character study, and a
period romance without
quite committing to
being either. A little more
irreverence from Button
would’ve elevated this
from a run of the mill
Woolf and Sackville-West
biopic to a truly percep-
tive portrayal of the lives
of these two remarkable
women.
