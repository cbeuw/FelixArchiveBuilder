Pointless, homophobic protests
Comment editor Charles Titmuss argues that the protests outside the schools are not only
unneccessary, but also definitely homophobic

T
he introduction of
the No Outsiders
p r o g r a m m e
to schools in
Birmingham has resulted
in significant nationwide
protests. The goal of
the programme was to
teach children about the
protected characteristics
in the Equalities Act
2010, including LGBT+
groups. Following its in-
troduction, some parents
objected to the content
present in the lessons
and, after talks with the
school broke down, they
began protesting outside
the school. These protests
have increased in size up
until the present, with up
to 80% of parents at the
school withdrawing their
children from the lessons.
Most of the protesters at
the school in question
come from an Islamic
background, and the pro-
tests have even spread to
other schools.
lessons will somehow
“proselytise homosexual-
ity.” Parental opposition
to the introduction of
these lessons is based on
the idea of “my child, my
choice.” Parents reserve
the right to remove their
children from classes
that they feel would be
inappropriate or that they
disagree with on a moral
basis.
Parent’s personal reli-
giousbeliefsformacritical
part of their identity and it
is important for many to
pass these beliefs on, so
that their children can live
an upstanding moral life.
For a society and the gov-
ernment to impose their
beliefs on the children of
the parents, this reeks of
tyranny. However, in my
opinion it is important to
expose children to as wide
a range of worldviews
and systems of morality
as possible. Ultimately,
it will be up to them as
free individuals to choose
how to live, and neither
their parents or the system
of education should not
restrict that. In this case
it seems as though the
parents are being more
restrictive than the ed-
ucation system and our
judgement on this case
should reflect that.
The age at which these
lessons are being given
is also a matter of con-
siderable concern for the
protesters. The lessons are
currently being given but
there are additional plans
to introduce sex education
lessons for children from
the age of five by 2020.
Many believe that this
type of content is best
left to be taught at home
or not at all and that the
introduction of these
lessons at such a young
age would be inappropri-
ate for children not mature
enough to deal with such
adult themes.
I believe that the
concerns about these
lessons being age ap-
propriate are unfounded.
The lessons within the
programme are based
on a book featuring two
same sex penguins raising
a chick as well as a dog
that doesn’t quite fit in.
This seems like a fairly
reasonable first exposure
to the nightmarish idea of
a same sex couple raising
a child.

consent. This is a very
important topic given that
over a four-year period
there were almost 30,000
cases of children sexually
abusing other children. In
the modern day, it is vital
to introduce children to
these concepts as early
as possible to ensure that
they behave appropriately
and know what to expect
from others.
Most importantly,
these protests can best
be qualified as a colossal
overreaction. to what is
a minor change to the
curriculum. Although it
is important to take the
parent’s concerns seri-
ously, they are unfounded
and they have managed
to be hugely homophobic
whilst protesting. To
quote, “we do not believe
in homosexuality but
that does not make us
homophobic.” Believing
in homosexuality is as
unnecessary as believing
in gravity. It is well doc-
umented behaviour in the
animal kingdom as well
as a feature throughout
human history. It was
acceptable behaviour
in Ancient Greece, the
Roman Republic and the
early Roman Empire,
and became less socially
acceptable with the rise
of Christianity. Unfortu-
nately for these protesters,
they live in an age in the
UK where homosexuality
is a perfectly acceptable
way to live your life. They
are proudly bearing the
flag of homophobia that
bigots the world over have
borne for millennia.
“Protesters are
concerned that
the lessons will

Concerns amongst the
protesters range from how
these lessons will spread
a version of morality not
in accordance with their
own, as well as that the
