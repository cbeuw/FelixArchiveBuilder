In response to Big Daddy Oil
An analysis of Saudi Aramco for decision makers of the 21st century

“According to
the Carbon
Accountability
Institute Saudi
Aramco is
responsible
for 3.4% of
cumulative
global
man-made
greenhouse
gas emissions
since 1885 ”
A
recent article
in Felix, “Big
Daddy Oil
outearns Apple
and Google, wants more”,
reported on records
seen by the Financial
Times which assert that
the state-owned oil
company Saudi Aramco
has a greater net income
than any other company
worldwide. Since many
of the graduates of this
university, and readers of
Felix, will in the future
become decision makers
in consultancies and in-
ternational organizations,
I urge you to take a per-
spective appropriate for
the 21st
century. Reports
on companies must
include a consideration
of the reliance on natural
capital and environmental
accountability. Because
until recently, natural
capital could be treated
as infinite, and environ-
mental feedbacks on the
economy negligible,
economic analyses tra-
ditionally ignore these
factors. However, in light
of scientific consensus that
man-made climate change
is having ramifications
on both the natural and
the man-made worlds
already, only by correctly
quantifying natural cap-
ital and environmental
feedbacks will financial
reports be of value in the
21st century. According to
the Carbon Accountability
Institute Saudi Aramco is
responsible for 3.4% of
cumulative global man-
made greenhouse gas
emissions since 1885.
It is disappointing to
find an article in a student
publication presenting
a favourable analysis of
an oil corporation while
neglecting any considera-
tion of environmental and
social values, or the fact
that its primary product
is a finite natural resource
with detrimental environ-
mental impacts. These
factors will strongly affect
the prospects of the oil
industry. Rather than
talking of diversifying
their portfolio to petro-
chemicals and renew-
ables, investors should
instead consider whether
companies plan to cease
oil extraction altogether in
line with scientific reason.
In response to questions
about peak oil, the CEO
of Aramco, Amin Nasser,
said that “fewer and
fewer of our stakeholders
accept logic and facts”
at a meeting of Davos in
February this year arguing
that “oil and gas is respon-
sible for much of today’s
economic growth, and
indeed future growth”.
However, the premise
economic growth being
of value to society is put
rather to question when
this economic growth is in
fact causing loss of human
life and the eradication
highly populated areas of
As is shown in a chart of
the top 500 companies
reproduced below, leaving
aside recent speculation
about Saudi Aramco, the
three top tech companies:
Apple, Samsung and
Alphabet all have larger
net incomes than Royal
Dutch Shell, BP, Total or
indeed any oil company.
Secondly, traditional
financial analysts are
too short-sighted to try
quantify ecological capital
(such as oil) and account-
ability for the environ-
ment (such as coral reef
bleaching and disruption
of climate systems) as a
result of companies’ oper-
ations. It will take a great
deal of labour in order
to accurately account
for these factors, but it
this would be of value to
society, certainly more so
than creating short-sight-
ed reports. Saudi Aramco
is the largest extractor of
oil and gas and despite
putting up a smoke screen
of small projects such as
carbon capture, it has in
fact increased its emis-
sions and its oil output.
Even comparing with the
oil industry, the emissions
of Saudi Aramco are the
worst of any oil company.
While other oil corpo-
rations have ceased to
increase their emissions,
as shown in a figure from
the Climate Accountabil-
ity Institute, year-on-year
Aramco churns out even
more into the atmosphere.
Do we value this? When
a company burns limited
capital and produces gross
increases in emissions
to sustain its financial
income, it is clearly not
a healthy sign for invest-
ment. Despite playing lip
service to renewables, the
fact is that SaudiAramco’s
environmental impact has
only deepened. Investing
into an oil and petrochem-
ical company in the hope
that they will obviate their
primary function of fossil
fuel extraction is foolish.
As Nasser said last year
“I am losing no sleep over
‘peak oil demand’”, while
BP has stated in its most
recent energy outlook
that “trillions of dollars
of investment in oil is
needed” over the next
twenty years.
Though it is easy
to fall into the trap of
using language loaded
in positive connotations
for companies with
large sums of money,
such as “impressive” net
income or “healthy” cash
flows, there is nothing
impressive or healthy
about Saudi Aramco. The
expansion of this exploit-
ative organization is a call
to arms for students and
future decision makers,
rather an opportunity to
practice the same finan-
cial reporting that has led
to loss of natural capital
and degradation of the
environment. Students
at world-leading univer-
sities such as Imperial
College have the potential
to create a responsible
economic system. This
can only occur if we learn
as students to consider the
environmental perspec-
tive every time we make
an analysis and every
time we take a decision.
Without understanding
natural capital and the
environmental impacts
of organizations, we will
value the exploitation
of natural resources for
short-term growth and
wonder what happened
to our belief in a better
future.

The environmental and
political dimensions of
Saudi Aramco indicate
its alleged financial
advantage rests on shaky
foundations. Even if Saudi
Aramco’s records are
completely honest, which
I will leave to others to
verify, the company has
limited prospects. Other
industries are moving to
take over from oil in the
21st century. Tech com-
panies, whose primary
resource is information
and creativity, as opposed
to a limited resource
derived from geograph-
ical circumstance, are
the giants of this century.
