Mac DeMarco’s Indie-Indie-Label Breakthrough
The Cowboy delivers one of his most intimate efforts yet.
H
ere comes the
cowboy / Here
comes the
cowboy / Here
comes the cowboy,” ad
infinitum. The lyric(s) of
the album opener and title
track of Mac DeMarco’s
fifth full-length studio
record — and his first
under his own label rather
than long-term partners
Captured Tracks — leave
one thinking that this
might be one of his
most minimal yet. And
indeed it is, as DeMarco
pushes the successful but
straightforward formula
that has come to define
his style (the self-labelled
“jizz-jazz” consisting
of unprocessed vocals,
a couple of guitars,
simple drums, bass, and
a sprinkling of synths) in
a further stripped-back
direction, picking up
from the acoustic-guitar-
and-dreamy-synth-based
tracks that formed a key
part of 2017’s This Old
Dog.
Here Comes the
Cowboy was recorded in a
couple of weeks this past
January, out of DeMarco’s
garage in a rainy LA (you
can even hear the rain
petering in and out of a
few tracks on the album).
Such a scene goes hand-
in-hand with the sound
and songwriting on this
record, which is perhaps
also best enjoyed as the
soundtrack to chilling
indoors on a rainy day
or soothing a post-New
Years-scale hangover —
this cowboy ain’t riding
through the Wild West.
Don’t let the simple
production fool you,
however: while the album
might be a reduced version
of the Mac we know, and
does drag in a place or
two, the highlights on
this record showcase the
essence of what earned
DeMarco his status as
a modern poster-boy of
indie — Here Comes the
Cowboy features some
of Mac DeMarco’s finest
work to date.
plaints of a privileged
celebrity, DeMarco’s
songwriting feels particu-
larly authentic, thanks to
the restrained production
and instrumentation,
which often foregrounds
his voice (his crooning
on ‘Skyless Moon’ is
a personal highlight)
-- and the fact that we as
listeners have directly
witnessed the growing
fame underpinning many
of the lyrics on this
album. Further, moments
on this record feel like an
admission of regret from
the ever-cool-cowboy
over actions taken in the
public eye.
DeMarco might not be
asking for our sympathy,
but it’s hard not to feel
some when a figure who
has become somewhat of
a reference point in con-
temporary meme culture
(admittedly at the result
of their own actions),
laments not being able to
be “nobody” for once.
On the flip side,
DeMarco hasn’t missed
the opportunity of his
label-freedom to give us
a few wild and outrageous
moments on this album
(I won’t spoil them all),
from his bold decision to
start the record with the
same phrase repeated over
and over for a perfect three
minutes, to his mimicking
a steam engine on ‘Choo
Choo’. It might be out
of place, ridiculous, and
musically non-ground-
breaking, but one can’t
help enjoy seeing Mac
let go and enjoy himself
on this record, be that in
these bizarre moments or
the album’s bare-bones,
garage-DIY production
that leaves each track at
the mercy of its songwrit-
ing only: since there’s
no turning back, might
as well continue making
the most of it, right?
In addition, there are a
few tracks, ‘All of Our
Yesterdays’ in particular,
that really feel like classic
Mac, even with their fairly
hands-off production. All
of this makes for an album
that, in its totality, might
seem like a watered-down
version of the same-old to
some fans, and too-laid
back to others, but none-
theless contains material
to appeal to both. This
isn’t Mac DeMarco’s
best album, but it does
merit a few listens, which
will hopefully reveal to
the listener that some
tracks really do marry
composition, production,
and lyrics well enough to
make them highlights of
his career thus far.
I really don’t see what this cover has to do with cowboys. // Mac’s Record Label

HERE COMES THE COWBOY
The Cowboy himself, Mac DeMarco, tuning up to lay
down some janky rhythms. // Tree Music Festival
“This might be
one of his most
minimal yet.“
Part of that has to do
with the lyrical content of
this album: the semi-in-
trospective, casual rumi-
nation on love and life
on this album might not
seem much different from
any on Mac’s past work,
but look closer and you’ll
see that this cowboy is
also singing about being
fed-up with the com-
plexities of modern life
(perhaps explaining some
of the basic writing and
production choices on the
album) and burden of his
own fame. Across the cuts
on this record Mac sings
about how “there’s no
turning back to nobody”
and “no second chance”
for “the creature on tel-
evision”, being “sick of
the city” and wanting to
be alone, a mind being
“filled” with “bullshit”,
and the bittersweet feeling
that a “dream” isn’t over
even when “all of our
yesterdays have gone.”
But far from seeming
like the whinging com-
