Smash Corner: Marth – the Weeb Swordsman
I
have avoided Fire
Emblem for so long,
but there is only so
much I can do versus
the 3rd biggest franchise
in Ultimate. That’s right,
today we’ll be talking
about swords, swords and
even more swords with
the fighter that started
it all, #21 in the roster:
Marth
Marth is the central
protagonist of the
original Fire Emblem
game, Shadow Dragon
and Blade of Light, first
released in 1990. Now
considered as the mascot
of his franchise, he made
his first appearance in
the Smash Bros series
in Melee, alongside the
lesser known Roy. Whilst
his friend may not have
always made the cut,
Marth appeared in every
following Smash game
and is now viewed as the
signature swordfighter of
the brawl. With a standard
weight and decent speed,
he uses his long blade to
hack, slash and react to his
opponent’s moves from a
reasonably safe distance.
Even if he is still a
close-combat character,
Marth’s sword gives him
an incredible range which
allows him to have an edge
on other melee fighters.
Furthermore, his sword
has a unique property: the
tip of the blade deals more
damage than the hilt. This
means that with every
normal, tilt, smash or
aerial attack, you ideally
want to hit your opponent
from as far as possible.
This allows you to inflict
a large amount of damage
whilst at a safe distance.
Marth’s neutral-air is
notably effective and
powerful if you manage to
hit this sweet spot.
Marth’s special moves
complement his kit very
well. His neutral-B is
his Shield Breaker, a
charged shield busting
stab with great range. His
up-special is the Dolphin
Slash, a simple vertical
recovery which cuts
through anyone above
him. Marth’s down-B is
a crucial part of his kit,
his Counter. If you get the
timing on point, it blocks
any incoming attack and
counter-strikes with a
matching force. Last but
not least, the side-special
Dancing Blade is a 4 hit
combo with very useful
versatility, as tilting the
joystick changes the
finishing move. Up will
make Marth perform an
upward slash, throwing
the opponent in the air to
follow up with an aerial.
Down, mixes it up with
multiple low jabs to have
an unusual number of
hits. And holding to the
side is a great kill move,
knocking back opponents
with a powerful last blow.
The key to playing
Marth is observing,
positioning and reacting
to your opponents. His
unique sword rewards
you for keeping your
distance and hitting your
enemies with just the tip
of the blade. It is hence
crucial not to get too close
and to know the reach of
each of your attacks to
make the best of them.
To do so effectively, you
must keep a sharp eye on
your opponent’s moves
to punish them with a
quick slash or Counter
by swiftly moving in the
correct position once
they’ve missed or ideally,
by predicting them. In
general, this must be done
for every fighter but it is
particularly important for
Marth’s quick and precise
game style.
To conclude, Marth is
an extremely powerful
swordfighter thanks to his
great reach but requires a
skilled and precise player
to lead him to victory.
This makes Marth one of
the hardest characters to
master but brings him to
high tier once you do. So
if the difficulty doesn’t
scare you then I suggest
you take a stab at him
and in no time, you’ll
be spamming: “I won’t
lose!”
