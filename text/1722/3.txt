Imperial College to publish results of latest staff
consultation regarding pension schemes

Deputy Editor, Joanna

the latest update in
the ongoing pension
saga
Joanna Wormald
Deputy Editor
I
mperial College
will next week
publish the results
of the latest staff
consultation regarding
changes to their pension
schemes.
This latest phase in the
long-running dispute that
saw countrywide strikes
last year adds a third
option to the 2018 valu-
ation of the Universities
Superannuation Scheme.
Currently, “significant in-
creases” in contributions
from both employers and
employees are scheduled
for October 2019 and
April 2020. The rises –
which would see staff
contributions increasing
from 8.8% to 11.4% and
employer contributions
increasing from 19.5% to
24.2% for a total increase
from 28.3% to 35.6% –
would be unsustainable
for many staff at Imperial.
A previous consultation
held in March proposed
two options, both of which
are included in the current
consultation. The “upper
bookend” approach would
increase total contribu-
tions to 33.7%, with 23%
coming from employers
and the remaining 10.7%
from staff. Universities
UK, which represents
the country’s higher ed-
ucation institutions, has
previously said this would
be “unsustainable” and
an “undeniable threat to
investment and to jobs”.

saw Im-
perial and
The Times collaborate
to host the latest joint
event in their year-long
partnership.
The event, titled "How
can we fix London's air
pollution problem" and
consisting of a presenta-
tion and panel discussion,
explored the media's role
in communicating the
impact air pollution has
on our lives.
Proceedings got
underay with a presenta-
tion, jointly delivered by
Sam Joiner, Interactive
and New Formats Editor
for The Times and Sunday
Times, and Ryan Watts,
Interactive journalist at
The Times and Sunday
Times. Together, Sam
and Ryan showcased
The Times' air pollution
campaign, "Clean Air for
All", which launched in
early May. During the
presentation, Sam and
Ryan walked those in
attendance through three
interactive resources
which they created for the
campaign:
The National Picture:
An air pollution postcode
checker enabling people
to see how polluted the
air they breathe is. The
dashboard offers powerful
metrics, including the
equivalent number of
for a panel discussion
and Q&A session, which
followed the presenta-
tion. Amongst the areas
of discussion were: the
importance of including
communities in deci-
sions about tackling air
pollution, the challenge
of changing engrained
behaviours and attitudes
such as overreliance on
using cars and the vital
role the media plays in
communicating the seri-
ousness of air pollution to
the public and policymak-
ers alike. Chief amongst
these discussion topics
was the significance of
widescale public realisa-
tion and aknowledgement
of the tangible and detri-
mental health impacts that
air pollution can have.
Dr. de Nazelle left the
audience contemplating a
sobering message:
"Death is just the tip of
the iceberg. Air pollution
also affects birth weight,
asthma, cancer, cognitive
development, diabetes,
and there are even links to
obesity. We can't put 'air
pollution' on a death cer-
tificate but we know that it
is a significant contributor
to many serious illnesses."

through storytelling of In-

case studies of how cities

tackling the air pollution
problem.
Forget Brexit: What is being
ignored?
The Times has launched a competition to give
one Imperial student the chance to write for Red
Box, The Times’award-winning political newslet-
ter, once a month for a three month period. The
winner will also meet Matt Chorley, the editor
of Red Box, to find out what it’s like working in
Westminster.
If you’re interested, start thinking about what
are the issues which are important to you that
are being overlooked while politicians are dis-
tracted by Brexit? What is the one law you would
pass if you were prime minister for the day?
What is happening in health, education, hous-
ing, employment, welfare, the environment,
transport, the arts, sport and family life? And
what will be the long-term impact on Britain if
the problems are not tackled soon?

This is to ensure that the
recovery of the USS’
deficit (£3.6 billion as
of March 2018) is not
hampered. However, this
approach would require
further negotiations,
which would not be com-
pleted until summer 2020.
This means the planned
increases in October 2019
and April 2020 would still
go ahead.
The “lower bookend”
approach would set con-
tributions at 20.4% from
employers and 9.3%
from staff for a total of
29.7%. However, this
approach is dependent on
being able to guarantee
that extra “contingent
contributions” would be
available in the event of
an economic downturn.
The USS has now
put forward a third way.
This would see increased
contributions of 30.7%
(21.1% from employers
and 9.6% from staff) come
into effect in October
2019. This would increase
to 34.7% in October 2021
unless a new arrangement
is agreed following
another valuation in 2020.
“The planned
increases in
October 2019
and April 2020
would still go
ahead”
It is not clear how this
contribution would be
split between employers
and staff.
Responses from staff
were collected by the
College last week. Impe-
rial’s formal response to
the consultation will be
published ahead of next
week’s deadline of 30
May.
"The main challenge
with these interactives
was translating the topic
to our readers in a way
that was relatable and
easily understandable",
explained Ryan whilst
highlighting The Times
and Sunday Times inter-
active team's aim to create
content which enhances
the reader's comprehen-
sion of a story in visually
compelling ways. Sam
concurred and echoed this
sentiment, adding:
"Scientific language
alone doesn't always
work well, that's why
we thought about using
cigarettes as an equiva-
lent, for example. It was
something we can all get
our head around."
Sam and Ryan were
later joined by Dr. Audrey
de Nazelle, Senior lec-
turer in the Faculty of
Natural Sciences, Centre
for Environmental Policy,
“Death is
the tip of the
iceberg”
A special opportunity
for an Imperial student to
write for The Times' Red
Box newsletter was also
announced at the event.
To enter the competition,
which closes on Monday
3rd
June, students must
send a 500 word sub-
mission via e-mail or the
competition webpage. The
winner will be announced
on 24th
June.
The year-long partner-
ship between Imperial and
The Times, which has seen
a programme of activities
with the aim to "stimulate
debate, provoke curiosity
and explore the future of
science, technology and
culture", will continue
with The Times confirmed
to feature in the Great
Exhibition Road Festival
2019 from 28th
to 30th
June. Imperial staff and
students who are yet to
redeem their free one-year
digital subscription to
The Times are advised to
