reparations for
Imperial College
Union's annual
Summer Ball,
which is set to be held on
Saturday 22nd
June, re-
cently hit a snag as many
of the involved student
societies threatened to
pull out over changes to
this year's event.
Dance Imperial, A
Capella and Big Band
societies were amongst
the societies to express
their dissatisfaction at the
changes, which have been
brought about by budget
constraints. DramSoc, Im-
perial's dramatic society
which is particularly
crucial to the setting up
and running of the event,
also raised health and
safety concerns.
DJ & Production So-
ciety's Sean Davies told
Felix: "Previously each
year we'd get paid for
our slots, drinks vouchers
and free entry to the main
event and the afterparty.
But, this year, they said
that we'd have to pay £5
to go to the afterparty and
that we'd also only get one
free drink each, which
would have to be a specific
thing. A lot of people that
would be playing might
end up having to spend
more money than they
were earning throughout
the whole thing."
Adam Collins, who
is involved in multiple
societies, including
Live Music Society and
DramSoc, echoed the
sentiment of performers
feeling de-prioritised and
undervalued by the Union,
stating: "I'm performing
at an event and I shouldn't
have to pay to get into the
event; the ticket should be
free and that shouldn't be
a bonus."
A large source of the
dissatisfaction stems from
the relative lack of notice
given to the clubs and
societies, as they were
only informed of changes
to the Summer Ball in an

should be changed in
the organisation of the
