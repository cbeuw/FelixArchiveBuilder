Background research
This is where a
background in an ana-
lytical discipline comes
up trumps. Think of this
as a research project. Is
there a demand for your
proposed idea? Look into
how unique your idea is,
what your selling points
are and how viable your
idea is. Will it be possible
to monetise your idea? Is
there any competition? Is
this competition fully es-
tablished? Can you offer
something different or an
incentive? These are key
questions you should be
thinking about.
It’s crucial to have a
target audience. Another
term thrown around
is market width. This
simply implies how many
people can benefit from
your proposed app. Is
your idea limited to a
specific demographic? It
is important to research
how wide your potential
user base may be. This is
simply a matter of mining
through resources, such as
Datamonitor and Statista,
amongst a host of others.
The data gathered from
archives is highly impor-
tant but often does not
paint the entire picture.
In some cases gleaning
relevant information is
simply impossible. Sur-
veying is invaluable in this
regard and is a powerful
tool for determining
whether your app idea is
valid or not. It also helps
you refine your ideas and
functionality in line with
the demand of your target
audience.
There are many free
templates available
online. Select the format
which suits you and take
to the streets! In person
questionnaires are the
most rewarding (although
Facebook and other
platforms allow you to
survey larger population
sizes without leaving your
room). Prepare a host of
questions that allow you to
validate your hypothesis.
Do not lead those being
surveyed. Be as impartial
as possible. Keep the
questions open-ended and
let the subjects talk. Start
with friends and family.
Bear in mind they will
find it hard to be impartial
in your presence. The
general public less so.
“The current
trend is for a
‘freemium’
model,
whereby the
app download
and basic
functionality
are free”
Select a suitable location,
if your target audience is
the student demographic
then of course, target the
walkways at university.
The data you gather will
help you formulate your
business model and finan-
cial projections.
Business Model
Your business model
refers to the means by
which you make money.
Common approaches
involve paid downloads,
paid added functionality/
features and advertising.
Video games constitute
the majority of ‘paid for’
apps. The current trend is
for a ‘freemium’ model,
wherebytheappdownload
and basic functionality
are free with additional
features being paid for.
The details of how and
when you monetise are
laid out in your financial
projections.
These spreadsheets are
the most important thing
that you will possess and
can be thought of as a
turbocharged profit and
loss sheet. You will need
to project things like your
number of users, how
often they will use your
app, how often they will
utilise paid for features (or
how much you will gain
from advertising based on
their traffic). You will also
need to detail costs for a
host of things including
staff, specialist expertise,
servers and storage, mar-
keting and office space
amongst others.
Potential investors will
want to see projections
for a minimum of three
years and will decide
to fund based upon the
projected return on their
investment. A model that
signifies a 10x profit over
the course of three years
is the minimum threshold
for commercially oriented
apps. Metrics to bear in
mind include; retention
rate, churn rate, CPI (cost
per install), DAU (daily
active users) and MAU
(monthly active users)
amongst others. Don’t
forget to budget for con-
tingencies by anticipating
things that may go wrong
and how much money you
may need to deal with
them.

concern and there is no
guarantee of success. The
general rule of thumb is
that you cannot protect an
‘idea’ and that anyone can
come along and replicate
it. In fact, there are large
groups that specialise in
mimicking fresh or suc-
cessful ideas and throwing
greater economic might
behind their version or
simply launching in a
different market.
In the UK, you can
however protect your app
by trademarking your
branding (both your name
and logo) and copyright-
ing the overall way your
app has been put together.
This involves elements
such as the colourways
you use, your page tran-
sitions and images for
example. This will limit
the ability of another
party ‘cloning’ your app
and will form part of your
intellectual property (IP).
Having these matters in
place is crucial to running
an app and also to poten-
tial sale later on down the
road.
Be sure to picky up a

We discuss how to practi-
cally make these concepts
a reality.....

Patent
This depends on your
geolocation. Here in the
UK and indeed through-
out Europe and Asia, apps
are not eligible for patent
protection unless they fit
very specific criteria. If
you fit within this limited
framework, cost is a major
