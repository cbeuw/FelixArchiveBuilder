elow are some
personal reflec-
tions submitted
on Ramadan,
the holy month in which
Muslims fast from dawn
to sunset in order to gain
consciousness of God
in all their actions. We
hope this article can show
that, whilst Ramadan is a
prescribed month, we all
experience it in our own
personal ways!

marathon comes to an end,
we try to maintain what
we practised in Ramadhan
for the rest of the year.
The aim being that each
Ramadhan is better than
the last as we strive to
work on ourselves as
Muslims and as students
at university.
Most importantly,
Ramadhan is a month to
reflect on my relationship
withAllah(God).Religion
is ever fluctuating; there
will be times when you
feel invincible in your
religion and others when
it can waver. This month
is often a time of spiritual
high for many, as com-
munities come together
for late night prayers and
iftaar (breaking the fast
at sunset). This spiritual
high encourages me to
increase in the number of
good deeds I do, whether
it be helping the homeless
or giving charity. The aim
is for these good deeds to
be continued throughout
the rest of the year to help
me improve my character,
not just to deprive myself
of food and drink for a
month.

Mercy is attributed
God in many ways. This
acts as a reminder for
Muslims: no matter how
much we mess up, neglect
our religion or get caught
up in our daily life, God is
always waiting to forgive
us and bestow His mercy
upon us. Ramadan is a
special time of year for
us. It’s the time of year
when one is encouraged to
start over and turn a new
page. It’s an opportunity
to engage in the worship
of God, not only to follow
the rules of the religion,
but to understand its very
essence.
It’s the time of year
to re-charge one’s body,
mind, heart and soul. The
body is re-charged by
teaching it self-control.
When fasting from food
and water, they are no
longer priorities, and so
our bodies become more
disciplined. The mind
is re-charged when we
read the Qur’an, attempt
to learn it and apply its
wisdom to our daily life.
As Muslim students,
we are taught to value
knowledge. During this
holy month, studying
and keeping up with
the workload can prove
challenging, but neverthe-
less striving to gain that
knowledge at this valuable
time would make the diffi-
culties worth it. The heart
is re-charged by becoming
more compassionate; we
are taught to be grateful
for the blessings we have,
consequently motivating
us to do and spread good
through the simplest acts
of charity. At this blessed
time our community of
brothers and sisters come
together, flourishing with
love and hope. The soul
is re-charged when we
engage in prayers with
the most genuine of inten-
tions, knowing that The
All-Hearer, All-Seeing,
All-Knowing, is waiting
to grant us peace, patience
and guidance.
Ramadan is the perfect
time to strive to be the
best person you could be,
build up good habits and
keep them up after the
holy month has passed.
It’s the perfect time

for soul searching, doing
good and seeking spiritual
fulfilment.
It’s the perfect time to
find purpose in everything
you do.
To me, Ramadan is a
month of giving back.
Khadija Mahmoud
For eleven months of
the year we live in Allah’s
blessing; our health, our
family, our success and
even our failures, whereby
we are given the ability to
move past them and, in
doing so, only strengthen
our resolve. For another
month we’re given so
many chances to give
back as we seek to purify
our bodies and souls and
acquire piety. Ramadan.
The month where rewards
are multiplied; a perfect
time to give back, not
just through serving
Allah as we spend nights
standing in prayer but in
serving His creation and,
in doing so, Him. Those
nights where His doors
of mercy are wide open,
calling to His believers to
approach with their good
deeds. Those nights serve
as an opportunity to thank
Him for what we have.
As He says in the Quran:
“If you are grateful, I will
surely increase you in
favour.” For me, this is an
incredibly special verse as
it reminds me of His gen-
erosity. If we just spend
some time thanking Him
for what He has blessed us
with, then He is so pleased
with our efforts that He
not only maintains but
increases our blessings.
However, our chance
to give back doesn’t
just stop there. As the
Prophet Muhammad
said: “Whoever relieves
a believer’s distress of the
distressful aspects of this
world, Allah will rescue
him from a difficulty
of the difficulties of the
Hereafter.” Relieving the
distress of others isn’t
just limited to paying
for a family’s iftaar in
a developing country,
giving back can start
much closer to home. We
can be rewarded in every
part of our day; the simple
acts of kindness that can
make other people’s day.

Ramadhan is often well
known as the Islamic holy
month when Muslims
around the world give up
food and drink. For me,
Ramadhan is more than
just having a growling
stomach and parched
mouth, it’s a time of reflec-
tion on the year just gone
and planning for the year
ahead. The way in which
we control our hunger and
thirst is similar to the way
in which we are advised to
control our thoughts, what
we say and how we act.
For me, Ramadhan
is like training for a
marathon; it is the month
of improvement in your
character, in how you
treat people, the amount
of charity that you give
and your own relationship
with God. As Ramadhan
comes to an end, just
as your training for a
“It is the
month of
improvement
in your
character, in
how you treat
people, the
amount of
charity that
you give and
your own
relationship
with God”

Even a smile, which the
Prophet teaches us is itself
a charity.
Thus, by serving
Allah’s creation, we are
not only serving and
pleasing Him but also
serving ourselves as Allah
promises us reward. I
guess my point here is
that giving back is really
a chance to help yourself
too in showing gratitude.
This Ramadan, I find
myself eager to go that
extra step to help those
around me, knowing that,
with every good deed,
Allah will only increase
what I am already blessed
with in this holy month
and the eleven others.

Ramadan completely
changes my life for one
month every year, but I
love it! It’s a chance to
increase my faith, fix my
bad habits and remind
myself of my duty to help
the poor and needy whose
everyday reality consists
of feeling hungry and
thirsty.
As part of my disserta-
tion this year, I explored
intermittent fasting and
its beneficial effects on
ageing and disease. I was
amazed by what I read.
Although I was aware that
fasting was good for my
soul, I was not so knowl-
edgeable about how good
it was for my body!
I’ve been fasting since
I was 11 and always knew
it was a good thing to do
spiritually. However, after
discovering the many
health benefits, I felt like
I could now completely
appreciate why it is one of
the five pillars of Islam.
Fasting has been prac-
tised for both religious
and medical purposes for
thousands of years and I
think it’s amazing that re-
searchers are discovering
the effects of fasting on
ageing and ageing-associ-
ated disorders.

Your mum coming in
and waking you up before
dawn, sleepily walking to
the dining table to gobble
down whatever food is put
in front of you, while your
mother is walking around
making sure that everyone
is eating and drinking
enough.
For many young people
this is how mornings in
Ramadan, the 9th
month of
the Islamic calendar, and
the month of fasting, look.
Ramadan is a spiritual
time for Muslims. It is
a time for prayers and
self-reflection. But it is
also a time for family. A
time of togetherness.
In most families,
whether you eat together
the rest of the year or not,
during Ramadan you are
sure to eat every meal
together. Even when that
meal is eaten at 3.00 am.
Praying and going to the
mosque together, visiting
relatives, having a lot
of guests over, are just
some of the examples
how families spend their
Ramadan together.
This experience
looks different for the
many students who live
away from home during
Ramadan.
“It’s a chance to increase my faith, fix my bad habits and remind myself of my duty to
help the poor and needy” // A’yunie Anwar
“Religion is ever fluctuating; there will be times when you feel invincible in your reli-
gion and others when it can waver” // A’yunie Anwar
relatives or your family
can easily make you
feel isolated and lonely.
Especially when the only
thing you seem to be
doing beside eating and
praying is studying for
your exams.
Not living with your
family does not mean
that you have to miss
out on the whole family
experience. You can still
do things that remind you
of home.
For example, since I
am lucky enough for my
mother to live relatively
close to come around for
a week, she flew over in
April to prepare some
samosas and other snacks
for me so I would not miss
out. And whenever I am
eating alone I try to video
call home.
If you are missing
the hectic and joy filled
Iftaars with your whole
family: Iftaar at Imperial
is an amazing alterna-
tive. For the past three
years, Imperial College’s
Islamic Society has or-
ganised Iftaar for every
day of Ramadan. It might
not be your “real” family,
but with all the hugs and
laughs, eating and praying
together, you are sure to
find a second family.
Then there is Eid, the
celebration at the end
of Ramadan. For many
“Ramadan is
the perfect
time to strive
to be the best
person you
could be, build
up good habits
and keep them
up after the
holy month
has passed”
“Ramadan is a
spiritual time
for Muslims.
It is a time for
prayers and
self-reflection.
But it is also a
time for family.
A time of
togetherness.”
“If you are
missing the
hectic and
joy filled
Iftaars with
your whole
family: Iftaar
at Imperial is
an amazing
alternative”
Muslims it is the high-
light of the year. That is
probably the day on which
the reality of being away
from family strikes the
most. The best remedies
for the loneliness on Eid is
organising to go to the Eid
prayer together with some
friends and then treating
yourself to some amazing
food!
Whether away from
family or at home, I
wish everyone a blessed
Ramadan!
Besides missing out
on delicious home-made
Iftaar cooked by mum,
eating alone in your
room and not seeing any
“For the past
three years,
Imperial
College’s
Islamic Society
has organised
Iftaar for
every day of
Ramadan”
