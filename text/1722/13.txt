AI: More than Worth It
I
t has almost been
seventy years since
Alan Turing pub-
lished the hugely
influential paper
‘Computing Machinery
and Intelligence’ where
he first posits the basis of
what we now know as the
Turing test. In a mere life-
time,computershavegone
from purely machines
of calculation to pock-
et-sized marvels capable
of mirroring sentience
to an uncanny degree of
success. Barbican’s new
exhibition, AI: More
than Human, hopes to
tell the story of humanity
and computer’s shared
evolution, setting its bar
high as an “unprecedented
survey of creative and
scientific developments in
artificial intelligence”. It’s
an ambitious pitch given
the collective obsession
with this subject – it
seems that you can’t go
more than two weeks
without a new AI-centric
event popping up at a
museum, art gallery, or
even the theatre (usually
proclaiming in a rather
temporally-challenged
fashion that “the future
is here”). Fortunately,
given the Barbican’s past
successes and its record
of great exhibitions, I was
excited to see if the new
exhibition would prove
to be not just “more than
human” but ‘more than
cliché’.
The moment I stepped
into the exhibition gallery,
I realised I was right to
be excited. What AI:
More than Human gets
right more than any other
exhibition I recall going to
is the sense of scope. The
emphasis is not bound by
modern interpretations
of computers or artificial
intelligence but rather
our attempts at creating a
thinking being. With that
angle,theexhibitionopens
by exploring our curious
history with golems and
other creatures brought to
life. Kode9’s newly com-
missioned sound instal-
lation spits out snippets
and samples of stories
about artificial entities in
an eerie fashion. In fact,
the whole first section,
The Dream of AI, has
a slightly chilling buzz
about it. Sound permeates
the gallery, accentuating
the often-grotesque
depictions of artificial
life forms imagined in
film and projected as a
supercut of sci-fi horrors.
Even Doraemon makes a
guest appearance in the
exhibition, reminding us
that the dream of AI is
not just in the past and
that we have a long way
to go before realising said
dreams. I was slightly
disappointed they went
with clips from the more
recent 3D-rendered Stand
by Me Doraemon but it
suits its purpose in linking
past, present, and future
just fine.
The second section,
Mind Machines, is a
slightly more conven-
tional exploration of
modern computing with
an interactive timeline as
its backbone. However,
even in the relatively
straightforward set-up,
there was great care taken
to show the new and shed
light on the lesser-known.
Gone is the gentlemen’s
club narrative of comput-
ing history, replaced by
a markedly more diverse
cast of characters. Even
chess, the Western think-
ing-man’s game oddly
prominent in computer
lore, was deemphasised in
favour of go, chess’s wild
Chinese cousin. Another
highlight in this section
includes Google PAIR’s
project, Waterfall of
Meaning, where you can
submit words to trickle
down the screen, veering
left and right depending on
its association with binary
concepts such as good/
bad and male/female.
Anna Ridler’s tulip-cen-
tred pieces take another
approach, combining
history, economics, com-
puting, and even politics
(see overleaf). Both these
projects remind us of how
much influence humans
still have over AI and
how far away we are from
creating an independently
thinking machine.
Data Worlds, the third
as I laid waste to a rural
English village), or record
snippets of sound for AI to
render as music. Among
these pieces designed
to inspire a giddying,
childish glee, are more
serious works exploring
ethical issues such as bias,
confidentiality, and truth.
The final section is
androids (to be explored
further in a future issue).
Unfortunately, with its
bare, robotic body and
genderless, ageless face,
I could only see the cast
of the next generation of
uncanny valley horror
movies. Not only do
synthetic humans feature
but also synthetic insects,
such as Yoichi Ochiai’s
artificial butterfly and
The Synthetic Apiary,
a possible solution for
the honeybee population
problem.
There’s very little to
fault about AI: More
than Human. It’s a rare
instance where there
really is something for
every demographic re-
gardless of age, gender,
race, and understanding
of computer sciences. It’s
a masterclass in retelling a
worn-out story and giving
a fresh perspective on
something that is already
so familiar to us. What’s
more, I didn’t once see
the buzzword ‘big data’
thrown around callously
as the question and
answer to everything, and
that is perhaps the greatest
triumph of all.
The Barbican’s new exhibition, AI: More than Human, is a colourful sandbox of AI-related treats with plenty of
surprises and none of them unwelcome.

For those unfamiliar
with your work, how
would you introduce
yourself and describe
your artwork?
I’m an artist. I like to
work with technology,
but not just because it is
there. I think about what
it can do and how it can
add to what I’m making,
about its associations
and the connotations of
using it: how can all of
these different things go
in and help amplify or
construct the message I’m
interested in and make it
conceptually stronger.
Was technology
something that you
always wanted to
incorporate in your
artwork?
I’ve always been
interested in using data
and technology, and
as machine learning
become more prevalent
and barriers to using it
dropped, it became a
natural way of exploring
this existing interest. My
background is in literature
and linguistics as well so
the other quite nice thing
is if you look at how
machine learning systems
work in labelling things, –
deciding when a thing is
a thing – it all just came
together, which is why I
think I find it so enjoyable
to work with. It just natu-
rally all fell together and
I feel that it has become a
really natural way to draw
together lots of different
aspects of my practice.
Alotofyourresearchis
focused on how art is
perceived or validated
through a scientific
lens. Could you briefly
describe what ‘art’
means to yourself?
This is a hard question!
I suppose in short art is
something that has intent
– you’re trying to question
the world through a
medium and a process.
What are your major
influences for your
work?
I think my background
in literature – I’m con-
stantly reading fiction
– has given me a really
good grasp on narrative
and trying to tell a story.
Also the type of books
that I like to read tend
to be about quite minor
things that still reflect
major issues and I think
this reflects back in my
work. I also read a lot of
random science facts as I
find these to be really in-
spiring to give new ideas
and directions.
I’m really excited to
see Mosaic Virus
and Myriad (Tulips)
at the Barbican in
person. What is the
significance of tulips
for you?
Mosaic Virus draws his-
torical parallels from the
‘tulip-mania’ that swept
across the Netherlands in
the 1630s and the specu-
lation currently ongoing
around crypto-currencies.
“Mosaic” is the name of
the virus that causes the
stripes in a petal which
increased their desirabil-
ity and helped cause the
speculative prices during
the time. In this piece,
the stripes depend on the
value of bitcoin, changing
over time to show how the
market fluctuates.
I want to draw together
ideas around capitalism,
value, and the tangible
and intangible nature of
speculation and collapse
from two very different
yet surprisingly similar
moments in history and
I found tulips a way to
do this. It also updates
another tradition – one of
the very first dataset used
for computer vision was
made from irises.
Furthermore, there is
a tradition of tulips in art
history. Tulips featured
prominently in Dutch
still life at the time, the
so-called ‘vanitas’ paint-
ings that illustrated that
beauty and treasure are
only fleeting. This piece
will update this tradition
but with a twist. The GAN
[generative adversarial
network] constructs an
image not of a real tulip,
but what it thinks a tulip
should be, much like how
seventeenth-century still
life pictures do not show
actual displays of flowers
but imagined bouquets (it
would be impossible for
some of the bouquets in
still-lifes to exist in reality
as the flowers shown
bloom at different times
of the year).
It must’ve been
exhausting work,
taking 10,000
photographs of tulips.
What was the process
like and how did you
make it through?
It was a very time
consuming process! But
what was quite nice is
the even though this is a
very digital piece, there is
was a very natural rhythm
to it – I stopped making
my dataset because the
tulip season ended. I
went to the flower market
one weekend and there
were no more tulips,
only peonies, so I had
to stop. So even though
it’s a very digital piece,
it was very much driven
by the rhythms of nature.
Also – and this shouldn’t
have surprised me given
the context – but it was
actually extremely diffi-
cult to find striped tulips
and I ended up going
all over the Netherlands
trying to find stripey ones!
Making this dataset
was so important to this
project. I worked testing
the dataset in order to
get the type of output I
wanted – and that changed
what type of flowers I
was buying, what shape,
what colour. The other
thing that I had to do for
this was categorise every
single photograph by
hand. What colour, what
type of tulip, how striped
it was, whether it was in
bud or dying. This was
an insane amount of work
and it is usually work
that is hidden. The whole
process of creating the
dataset took around four
months. By choosing
to make it a separate
work that is displayed in
relation to the video work,
I draw attention to this act
of categorisation – and
also the human element
of it, by handwriting
each of the labels. I can
use it to start to have
discussions – particularly
in non-technical commu-
nities – about the fact that
there is always a human
decision somewhere
along the chain of using
AI and that it is not this
absolute correct thing...
even something as simple
as a tulip is difficult to put
into discrete categories –
is it white or pale pink, is
it orange or yellow – and
how if it’s difficult for
something as simple as
a flower, imagine how
difficult it will be for
something as complex as
gender or identity! It has
become parallel work,
unpicking ideas to do
with labour, technology
and categorisation and
also the humanness that
is behind every algorithm,
every decision made by an
AI.
But despite all of this
categorisation it is a
mistake to think that I
have control. It is impos-
sible to predict what will
come out in each of the
stills – I can guess, but I
cannot know. And this to
me is really exciting. It
is these ‘mistakes’ that
drive me to use this as
a material – it becomes
weird and eerie in a way
that I wouldn’t be able to
do myself, and draws on
the history of time-lapse
photography but through
a lens.
Do you ever feel
wary of technology
and automation
encroaching on
human expression as
some people believe?
No, for me it is very
much a tool and a process.
I don’t find it encroaching
on human expression, I
find it a way of expressing
myself more fully, in
ways that I was never able
to before.
What thoughts or
impressions do you
hope your audience
will leave with after
seeing your works at
the Barbican?
I hope that they can see
the poetic potential of this
as a medium!
Finally, do you have
any ideas for future
projects and is there
any technology that
you’re hoping to use in
later works?
I’ve making a new
project with Opera
North that will debut in
the autumn. It’s really
exciting to push the work
I’m doing but using sound
and performance.
