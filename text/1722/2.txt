Happy Birthday Lauren
L
auren Dennis,
who sadly
passed away in
October follow-
ing a battle with bowel
cancer, was a Chemistry
student at Imperial, a
great friend of mine
and the strongest per-
son I know. Tomorrow
(25th
May) is Lauren's
birthday; she would be
turning 24 so I wanted
to take this oppotunity
to dedicate this Editorial
to her:
Yoo Lauren, wys?
As per, I wanted to start
this how I started every
conversation with you. I
can't lie man, I still strug-
gle to talk about you but I
felt slightly better after the
last letter I wrote to you so
here goes. I miss you. It's
been pretty difficult since
you passed and I think
about you everyday.
I've been agonising for
the last month or so about
what I even wanted to
say to be honest. Having
said that, my procras-
tination is still peak. A
month's planning and
I'm still here, hours after
the print deadline. Let's
hope the printers allow
me. Anyway, like your
mum always tells me, you
wanted to be remembered,
not mourned, so I thought:
what better way to remem-
ber you than to reminisce
about one of my favourite
memories with you?
Taking it back to 24th
March 2018. I'd just
finished my disastrous
Final Year Design Project,
a project that can only be
described as a harrowing
ordeal, the deadline of
which was on 19th
March,
my 22nd
birthday. After
a five day cycle of sleep,
2
drink, sleep, repeat, Shiji,
Isaac and I made our way
over to yours for the carrot
cake you'd made me to
celebrate. After raiding
your fridge as per, we
headed to the studio, you
jumped on the podcast
and we spent the after-
noon catching jokes about
Kanye West memes. Fast
forward a couple hours
and I was getting ready
to head to my cousin's
birthday party. My sister
had already flaked, as
had Isaac and Shiji, but I
knew I could count on you
to back me. You jumped
in the car, we headed to
King's Cross and danced
the night away to 90s
R&B tunes.
It's funny because it
really doesn't sound like
the most eventful of days
but, looking back, it's
moments like that - you
feeding me McDonald's
chips while I tried not
to crash, with Bryson
Tiller blaring in the back-
ground - which I'll forever
cherish.
Much love my G!

Could this year's Summer Ball be the last held on campus? // Imperial College Union
IstheSummerBall"unsustainable"?
NEWS
(cont.)
Project Team - Kristie
Knapp, Helen Bhandari,
Jess Harrison & Claudia
Caravello - and a suitable
compromise seems to
have been reached in the
majority of cases.
One such issue that
has been resolved is the
afterparty, which was
described by some as
previously having a "very
bare schedule", with
Spotify playlists playing
in many of the rooms, to
the chagrin of many of
the student societies per-
forming. There will now
be DJs performing at the
afterparty.
Although the dispute
seems to have been
resolved in most cases,
it raises the question of
whether the Summer
Ball is sustainable in its
current format. When
this question was put to
Jess, she told Felix: "No.
It's not fair that there are
parts of that student ticket
that go toward paying
for the fencing, paying
for carpet... instead of
that going on an artist
or more fireworks, more
fairground rides, which is
honestly what we'd rather
put the money on."
Jess described the
prospect of the Summer
Ball moving from Impe-
rial's South Kensington
campus to an external
venue as a "wonderful
idea" and revealed that
serious discussions are
being had about the
possibility of making this
change for future years.
Jess added: "If it were
my decision, I would have
moved us already but it's
all linked in with finance
and risk... it's slightly
higher than me."
After making a loss in
previous years, this year's
Summer Ball has seen
more pressure to ensure
the event breaks even.
The additional budget
contraints led to many of
the changes which caused
dissatisfaction amongst
the CSPs. Explaining this
to Felix, Jess added: "The
ticket prices have stayed
the same this year but
suppliers, who do a lot
for us and this event, their
costs go up every single
year. Carpets, security,
bar staff, stewards, the
fireworks, the fairground
rides, everything goes up
a percentage each year".
The changes to the
annual Imperial Festival -
as reported by Felix, this
year sees the introduction
of the larger "Great
Exhibition Road Festival
2019" - has also posed
a logistical challenge to
the Summer Ball Project
Team. The festival, which
is to be held the weekend
after Summer Ball, means
that the team had to
reschedule many aspects
regarding the set-up and
clearing up of campus
following the ball.
