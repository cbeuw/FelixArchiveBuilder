C
haotic scenes
were seen
outside the
Dyson School of
Engineering, after a fran-
tic student attempted to
set the fire alarm off, in a
bid to avoid taking exams
for her subject.
Veera Mills, a third
year Design Engineering
student, was reported
to have suffered from
“instantaneous insanity”,
during her 2-hour Fash-
ionable Toiletries exam,
when she allegedly shot
up from her seat, decked
the nearest examiner and
broke the fire alarm ,
screaming “I’m a Nervous
Wreck, Get Me Out of
Here!”
NegaFelix was unable
to conduct a full inter-
view with Ms Mills, but
was able to obtain some
comments prior to her
being taken to the Faculty
Building for enhanced
interrogation further ques-
tioning. “It’s all worth-
less!” she cried, “why the
fuck am I learning optimal
ways to wipe shit??”
Friends of the alleged
perpetrator say that the
attempt was completely
out of character. “Yeah, it
doesn’t make any sense,”
said Enrico Gasparelli,
third year Aeronautical
Engineering student.
“Des Eng isn’t even that
difficult – how hard is it to
sketch a toilet brush?? Do
they even have to sharpen
their own pencils?”
Irene Reykjavik,
Vice-Provost (Subjuga-
tion) was not pleased at
the news. “What a load
of rubbish,” she remarked
whilst scrolling through
her Twitter feed, “all the
courses here are perfectly
tailored to maximise stress
and minimise wellbeing,
whilst adding value to the
College. Wait, did I say
that right?”
What do they even learn in there... // Imperial College
Desperate student sets off fire alarm to avoid sitting
exam for useless degree
This week your friends
snake you and get a house
without you.
Looks like you might just
live in the library next
year.
This week you’re Andrea
Leadsom. Your group
project is going to shit,
and you’re not about to
stick around as project
lead when it happens.
Time to bounce.
This week you realise you
have 36 hours of lectures
left to cover and only 10
hours before the exam.
Well, if the writers of
Game of Thrones can do
it, so can you. Just don’t
expect rave reviews.
This week you’re the
Felix Editor. Not much
in the way of content this
term.
Looks like the paper’s
going to be one large
Sustainability section.
The irony of it all.
This week you are an
alumnus. You’ve finally,
after booking one in
first year, got your
Counselling appointment.
Perfect - you’ve got
plenty of trauma to work
through!
This week you are both
sleep-deprived and fed up
of this bullshit.
Are you a student or just
Theresa May’s publicist?
This week, you’re the
Horoscopes writer.
Clearly whatever
connection you had with
the Universe is broken,
because these have been
shit for a while. Time to
get a life, pal.
This week you finish your
final exam at Imperial. As
you’re now technically
not a student, you
subsequently lose your
purpose in life.
Is this a mid-term crisis?
This week you stll
haven’t managed
to secure a summer
internship.
Good thing too, ‘cos the
way exam season’s going
you’re going to need the
free calendar.
This week you’re Jamie
Oliver. You decide the
best way to keep your
restaurants going is to
diversify your offerings.
Turkey Twizzlers maybe?
This week Pluto is
ascending, meaning your
bank account should be
seeing a positive cash
flow.
Wow, you might just even
get back up to zero!
