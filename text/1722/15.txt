Here’s what to expect
from our third workshop
of term: Belly Hoop.
This workshop is a little
different to others where
we will be learning some
belly dance moves and
some hooping moves and
combining them! We’ll
be starting right from the
basics so don’t worry if
you’ve never belly danced
or hula hooped before.
This will be an exciting
class that will help you
practise your isolations
and gives you a great
workout. Rani (our treas-
urer) and Andrea (the
founder of Belly Hoop at
Imperial) will be running
this exciting Belly Hoop
experience. You may
remember they ran this
workshop last winter
at the Dance Imperial
workshop weekend and it
was a complete hit, so we
decided to bring it back!
Rani will be leading you
through some basic belly
dance moves focusing on
technique and style and
Andrea will be teaching
some basic hooping skills
involving some static,
dynamic and travelling
steps. Together they will
then demonstrate how to
combine belly dance with
hooping. To finish the
workshop Andrea will be
bringing along her LED
hoop if anyone would like
to try it out. So, if you’re
up for a challenge or want
to try something new,
come along to the Belly
Hoop workshop.
Unfortunately, there is
a limited number of hoops
which will be given out on
a first come, first served
basis so book your place
fast if you would like to
try this fun and challeng-
ing workshop. The final
workshop in the series is
“vintage combos” tribal
fusion workshop on 18th
June, keep an eye out for
more information on this
workshop. Our regular
classes will start up again
in October, when we will
run a weekly beginners’
class for newcomers to
