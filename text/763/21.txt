I have none so don't even ask me, because as soon as one becomes available
I will inform you via FELIX and then it's first come first served.
4 . I n s u r a n c e
My, this has been ftin. I keep receiving forms telling me to forward a Security
Officers report on all the claims I received from various people last term.
All this entails, I was reliably informed last year by College is, we send the
forms to security, they stamp it and sign it and send it off to the Brokers.
However, on contacting the Broker this term and telling them all my forms
have been through security and they had stamped them as the security diary
shows, I was told "yes they all have this funny little stamp on but there is
no completed security report form attached." It appears that neither myself
nor security were ever given report forms from College when they passed
responsibility from College to the Union for Hall of Residence insurance.
All of you out there waiting for money please be patient as I've probably
got to do the whole thing all over again now, knowing my luck they probably
won't accept photocopies of claims. It's not security's fault nor, I think, mine
but I'll let you draw your own conclusions.
5 . E l e c t i o n s
The election papers are now up, please will all candidates come and see
me to collect a copy of the rules. Future Dep Reps watch your departmental
notice boards.
6 . D u p l i c a t i n g S e r v i c e
The Gestetner has now been fixed and the office photocopier has been
serviced. Everything is hunky dorey, and even the new 50's scanner is brilliant
(touch wood).
These are motions to be resubmitted under the three
year rule.

IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
Proposal for extension of Sports Hall f e a s i b i l i t y study
to include new Junior Common Room
Recent surveys have shown that many potential students reject offers from Imperial
College because of the 'poor social atmosphere' and lack of good s o c i a l events. Students
at a college the size of Imperial can usually expect social a c t i v i t i e s of a scale which
the Students' Union i s currently unable to provide. The Union is restricted as follows:
1) The current Junior Common Room is the only room available to the Union for
social events for more than 250 people. It i s , however, not purpose-built and i s
considered by many organisers to be unsuitable in some respects. Furthermore the
p r o f i t s from the JCR bar, which are essential to make such events f i n a n c i a l l y
viable, do not return to IC Union but go into the college refectory account.
2) The Union Building i s not suitable for such a c t i v i t i e s because the rooms are too
small and complaints from local residents l i m i t 'noisy' events to two or three
times a year, at the most.
We believe that i f IC Union is to provide entertainments and s o c i a l a c t i v i t i e s up
to the standard provided in comparable i n s t i t u t i o n s , we need a room under Union control,
capable of holding over 400 students, on the College site where noise is not a problem.
Any bar or catering outlets in this room should be controlled by the Union so that the
p r o f i t s can be used to subsidise regular, affordable social events.
If the Union were to gain control of the bar in the Junior Common Room, the JCR
could serve this purpose adeguately. However we feel that the proposals for a new indoor
sports h a l l at the South Kensington s i t e could ultimately offer the ideal solution for
both College and the Union. A Union-controlled Junior Common Room incorporated in the
new sports hall building would not only satisfy the Union's need for space but would
release more areas in the Sherfield building for further refectory expansion, should
this prove necessary. Demands for space from a l l sectors of the college become ever
more c r i t i c a l bearing in mind the projected increase in student numbers and also the
proposed merge with St. Mary's Hospital Medical School.
1. Government p r o p o s a l s to cut the budget of the Inner London Education
A u t h o r i t y by £120m i n the coming y e a r , and plans to remove the r i g h t of

2. Cuts i n the rate support grant and new " r a t e c a p p i n g " p r o p o s a l s w i l l l e a d
to a s e r i o u s underfunding of L E A ' s which w i l l i n t u r n lead to a decreased
q u a l i t y of e d u c a t i o n .
3. The higher c o s t s and p a r t i c u l a r s o c i a l c o n d i t i o n s found i n inner London
mean that education here w i l l be more epensive than o t h e r w i s e .

as a s e r v i c e to the whole of London w i l l t h e r e f o r e be wrecked.
