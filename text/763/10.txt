• Her first is in make-up,
which she wears not a lot,
Her second is in passion,
which makes me so hot.
Her third is in pretty, of her
this is true.
And her fourth is in loving,
which I'd like to do.
Her fifth is in happy, which
she is ail the time.
Her sixth is in lover, for which
I can think of no rhyme.
Her seventh is in plaster, at
least for a while,
Whilst her lust is insatiable if I
give her a smile!
In her whole I would wallow, if
given the chance;
So come on, dear Valentine,
let's have a romance!
