Feature FELIX, Friday February 13th 1987 7
highlighted by the Swiss chemical
firm disaster, where 30 tonnes of
herbicide escaped from the Sandoz
factory in to the Rhine. The death of
500,000 fish is just one result of this
carelessness—full recovery of the
river ecosystem will take at least 10
years. This incident is another
example of the economic damage
created by pollution. The eel trade
based on the Rhine was almost
obliterated, due to the deaths of the
fish.
One of the arguments most
frequently used against the
introduction of pollution control
measures is the cost of such
technologies. Although this may well
be the case at present, there are three
general reasons to believe that this
will not always be true. Firstly, as the
supply of a good increases this
generally induces the fall in prices;
the more research and development
put in the more likely we are to find
cheaper and cheaper ways to produce
devices to reduce emission of
pollutants. Secondly, we must weigh
up long term costs against short term
costs; in Britain it is estimated that it
will cost £200 million to clean our
waterways of nitrogen pollutants-
how much cheaper would it have been
to prevent their initial leaking into our
Some of these technologies are
already in action: the FGDs, which
reduce emission of sulphur dioxide
from coal-fired power stations have
been fitted to many stations
throughout Europe. Lead has been
removed from petrol in Germany and
Holland, while in the US the fitting
of catalytic converters to exhaust
pipes on new cars has reduced
emissions of CO2 and hydrocarbons
by 90%, and of nitrogen oxides by
75%, between 1970 and 1984.
The second stalling point of the
establishment is over the lack of proof
of harmful effects of pollutants. For
every expert who will say
radioactivity is harmful there is
another who will say there is no
evidence of harm. It has taken a long
time for people to accept that Acid
rain is causing damage to
Scandinavian and German fir trees.
As scientists we have a role to play
in research on the effects of pollution
but more important is the activity of
generating solutions to the problems
of environmental contamination.
It is European Year of the
Environment this year—one of its
strongest messages should be to make
pollution control a series of
preventative policies and not, as it has
been, a case of shutting the stable
"Dead fish in the Rhine and radioactive sheep"
waterways. Thirdly, social costs must
be taken into account; economic
development is not an end in itself but
a means to achieve an improvement
in the quality of life—part of this
quality is the quality of our
environment. Furthermore these
technologies could have a significant
effect on reducing the social cost of
unemployment: eg the fitting of Fluid
Gas Desulphurizers (FGDs) to power
stations may generate up to 3000jobs
each.
door after the horse has bolted. It is
important that the economic
advantages of pollution control should
be stressed.
As a contribution to the European
Year of the Er ' -ment, Imperial
College is staging an environmental
Week from March 2nd-6th; there will
be displays and talks by various
groups with interests in the
environment, as well as films and
stalls around the Collge.

It is now that time of year when
prospective sabbatical candidates start
to collar gossip column writers and
bore them stupid about various
"embarassing" incidents they claim
to have endured. These incidents are
generally either anatomically
impossible, suicidal or just plain
tedious. However they all have one
thing in common, they are all totally
fictitious.
This week we can guarantee that all
the stories concerning this rare breed
do not originate from anyhwere near
the respective horses' mouths. The
first story concerns a certain Union
Publicity Officer who was bemused
at not receiving any money from the
tax office recently. The main reason
for this common occurence was his
strange method of posting his forms.
Rather than put them in an envelope
and into a post-box like any other sane
human being, he goes for the
alternative method of putting them
into Christine Taig's desk and
forgetting about it. Now, had he put
a stamp on it...
It seems that Stephanie Snell is so
grateful for toy-boy Mark "I only
sleep on her floor" Ball, that she
proceeded to thank all the people that
brought her and Mark together
through the channels of IC Radio.
Dave Tyler and Dave Williams got
special namechecks as the people who
brought romance into her life by
consistently winding them up about
their supposed love-life.
Resident brick Man Tai Tseung
seems never to get the hint. After
booking two parties in the JCR for
this term he happily went away for
regular dinners with Anne Diamond.
In between these excursions he would
go up to the Union Office where there
is a big sign explaining that there
cannot be any parties in the JCR
because of the redecoration work; and
all around him people were talking
about the work while painting their
boycott posters. But he cheerfully
went on arranging things and
dreaming of Lobster Thermidor with
Anne Diamond. Until the fateful day
when he tried to get some posters
designed for the events, and someone
kindly reminded him about the
building work. Duly panicked he
finally went off and checked, to find
out that he had to use the Main Dining
Hall instead—a room known politely
as "the aircraft hangar." No doubt
when the four-minute warning comes
he will be booking another dinner.
Sarah Kirk, excitable denizen of the
Biochemistry department and general
menace to occupants of the Snack
Bar, has shown that she is to subtlety
what Genghis Khan was to socialism.
Late for morning lecture she dashed
into a lift in Sherfield to be faced with
none other than John Smith, College
Secretary. Unable to cope with this
degree of authority she instantly leapt
back out of the lift with a shriek.
Thinking that the lift had gone she
turned to her friend and explained;
"Urgh, I'm not getting into a lift with
John Smith." At this point she turned
around again to find that the lift, and
of course John Smith, were still there
and listening to every word.
Once again it is that time to relay
another Joe 90 story. Our Joe is
currently heading for mega-stardom
with stories stranger than those found
in Dallas. No instant plastic surgery
for Joe, just a tale of alarm clocks.
One day, after another sojourn in
the Southside hostelry, Joe realised
that it was the day before the Guilds
trip to Brighton and that he must not
miss it on any account. So he decided
that the thing to do was to get an
alarm clock. Simple enough really, it
was just that he wanted it at 12
midnight.
The first thing to do was to ask
some random passerby in the street
whether they had one. The poor
unfortunate victim of this question
was an American woman who denied
that she carried alarm clocks around
with her quite vehemently.
Remember that our Joe was more than
two sheets to the wind at this point
in the story.
Unsuccessful with this ploy he
decided to go home on the tube back
to Hammersmith. After asking
several passengers he managed to
alight at the correct station and made
his way back to his flat. However he
still did not have anything even
resembling an alarm clock.
Undaunted by this fact, and intellect
unblunted by his alcohol-induced
condition he came to the conclusion
that the people in the flat downstairs
must have one. His solution was to
knock on the door, go straight in and
take a random alarm clock while the
occupants were still recoiling from the
light, with the immortal words:
"Seeing as I've just woken you up,
you won't be getting up early
tomorrow, will you?"
