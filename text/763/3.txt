FELIX FELIX, Friday February 13th 1987 3
Sabbatical Elections
Yesterday the papers went up for next
year's sabbatical posts; already a few
people have their names up.
Hopefully the four sabbatical posts
will be fiercely contested, in contrast
to last year when only the President
attracted more than one credible
candidate. No doubt the greater
competition for jobs for graduates
deters students from standing for a
Union sabbatical, but the nature of the
jobs which our officers take on is also
significant. It is sad that so many
students do not consider running for
Union posts because they feel the cons
outweigh the pros.
Election Publicity
Since the date of papers down
(Thursday February 26th) clashes
rather awkwardly with FELIX
production, I am revising the
deadlines for the submission of
publicity for printing. Candidates who
wish to guarantee that their publicity
will be ready by 5.30pm on Thursday
should submit finished artwork (i.e.
completed paste-up) by 9.30am on
Monday February 23rd. Other than
this, candidates should expect to have
to wait two College days for publicity
to be printed. All posters and
handouts which have been submitted
on time will be released on Thursday
at 5.30pm exactly, accompanied with
an invoice. Similarly, publicity due
for release on other days cannot be
collected until 5.30pm. Candidates
for CCU posts should see me about
their publicicty.
Copy of the manifestos issue of
FELIX (March 6th) should be
submitted on a single side of A4
paper, and must be typed or
handwritten double-spaced.
Candidates will not be allowed to
proof-read their own manifesto; the
FELIX staff will ensure that copy will

be reproduced exactly. The deadline
for manifestos is 9.30am on Monday
March 2nd.
The allowed budget for paper
publicity this year is £60. I have
revised the Print Unit charges so that
materials are charged at cost price;
this should allow two A3 posters and
a double-sided A4 handout if they
wish to utilise their full allowance.
1 will be available to assist with the
production of artwork on Mondays
and Fridays, and over the weekend of
February 21st and 22nd. The office
will also be available for use on
Tuesday, but not at other times. All
copy for typesetting (other than
manifestos) must be submitted one
complete College day before it is
required. Once proof-read it will be
corrected as soon as possible. All
candidates will be allowed to use the
FELIX bromide camera and
photocopier, but not either of the
photo-typesetters. I will be able to
provide assistance in marking up copy
when required.
1 will be happy to speak to anyone
who requires printed publicity, and to
give full details of print unit charges.

NOTICE
FELIX is now able to accept copy on floppy disks.
Copy submitted to FELIX on floppy disk should be
accompanied whenever possible by a printout. The
disks should be standard IBM PC compatible
format. Please note the filename on the
accompanying printout.
Files created using 'Wordstar' should be opened in
non-document mode, non-justified. Document files
may be converted by printing them to disk.
Any special notes concerning layout and typeface
should be made on the printout only. Please do
not include any commands or instructions in the
file, as this causes delays in the conversion
process.
Disks should be brought to the office in Beit Quad,
rather than sent via the internal mail system, and
a copy will be taken of the file; disks will not be
needed once the initial copy has been made.
Deadlines are the same as for written submissions:
Sports & Clubs—1.30pm Monday
Letters—1.30pm Tuesday
We are unable to accept Small Ads or What's On
entries submitted on disk.
