Sabbaticals FELIX, Friday February 13th 1987 8
or a Dep Rep
Who wants to be Hon Sec?
In the second of our
sabbatical profiles, Dave
Colley writes about being
ICU dogsbody.
I arrive at the office between 9.45 to
10.00am; on arrival it is time to settle
down to write some minutes until the
mail is delivered.
The mail that usually arrives for me
is insurance details, bills for
transport, or any 'loonie' mail that
might have been addressed to the
Union. Having filed this the first of
the enquiries about whether or not the
Union has any parking permits left,
because some Porche driver finds
they have to walk to College from
Queensgate, arrives. This spot on the
Monday morning is usually taken up
by people telling me how rough the
vans are sounding or that the reason
the exhaust pipe fell of the van was
nothing to do with them. Sometimes
there is that worrying phone call from
Yorkshire telling me that the van isn't
starting and the A A are on their way.
After sorting out the cash and
complaints along with an heroic saint
called Kathy, in walks the first of a
new intake asking for a Union card
although there are enough signs
scattered around the Union Office
saying that the cards will be done only
on Tuesday between 2.00 and 4.00pm
(it still anoyes me that some people
walk in with a registry slip from
October 31st 1986, why couldn't they
get their cards at the alloted time?)
Then the time is upon me to sort
out the outside hire vans for the
weekend. This could be quite cut and
dried, however, it is a pain the arse
when someone comes in on Thursday
afternoon and cancels them or wants
to order a van. This is followed by
a call to Bristol to ask the motor
insurers to add the vans temporarily
to our policy.
I then settle down to a bit more
minute taking and in walks the first
person of the day to ask for an
insurance form and aks what is
needed to speed forth their claim.
The "rush hour" between 12.30
and 4.00pm is the next thing on the
agenda and the office explodes with
people checking mail, making phone
calls, booking vans and rooms and
asking questions or favours. During
these hours I try to take some of the
pressure off Kathy and help out all the
people I can.
In between this, the job that can be
done is the gestetnering. This ranges
from gestetnering minutes to
gestetnering posters and flyleaflets
and involves the operator being
covered in large globules of ink. (For
those of you who wonder at and take
the piss out of my dungarees, there
is a sound reason for wearing them.)
The other part of my duplicating
empire is the photocopier which has
been serviced. But most of my
dinnertime question and answer
session is spent trying to piece back
together a broken photocopier
because people can't find the paper
tray and dismantle the whole thing.
At about this time I see that we're
running low on Xerox paper and
Norman has requested bin bags and
aprons and Kevin wants a safety boot
catalogue or a diary. So I don my coat
and hat and grab my all terrain, four
wheeled transport vehicle and head
down to the stores to pick up the
items. Yet again they don't have a
safety boot catalogue, so Kevin won't
be pleased and the bin bags are on
order so we will have to 'borrow'
some from somewhere.
At about 4 o'clock at the beginning
of both the Christmas and Easter
terms I trek off to one of the
American Colleges that are affiliated
to us to tell them what we have to
offer them and take posters
advertising events, then it's back in
time for Council or some other
committee and to take minutes.
M i n u t e s : This has a special
paragraph all of its own as this is
possibly the most boring thing that
Is there anyone out there studying
Physics. Maths or Computing, who
fancies a week in Sweden, May 9th?
The Royal Institute of Technology
in Stockholm is inviting students from
30 universities around the world for
a "friendly week of exchanging
ideas." From what I can gather the
programme is about 50% industrial
visits and presentations and 50%
anyone on a committee can make
anybody else do. It's alright if you
only have to do it for one committee,
but for eight it's getting a bit steep.
The writing of minutes involves
writing a rough copy at the meeting
then writing it out neatly for Pat to
type, and then reading them again,
then producing enough copies for
Council, for the next meeting of the
committee, then I glue a copy in the
minute book. All this is done so that
people in the future can read what
we've done and people of the present
can make paper darts to attack us
with.
After everyone has gone home the
Hon Sec comes alive and up go
election papers and new notice board
allocations and the printing of election
rules can take place relatively
undisturbed. Also at this moment a
real attempt is made to suss-out the
jobs for tomorrow and then it's down
to Norm's or the bar for some food
and a swift pint and to listen to some
pisshead in the bar (probably me a
few years back) saying "bloody
typical, boozing again, you only took
on this job for a year o f f or "don't
you ever work."
The answer is yes, we do work hard
and to any budding Hon Sec out there
please don't think this job is a year
off, because it isn't, it's probably one
of the hardest jobs to do because
you've got to deal with people over
points and views which a year ago
you agreed with, and because no-one
understands a job until they do it,
you've got a different view now.

having a good time in Stockholm (a
brilliant city!)—wild parties etc. etc.
The good bit is that the Swedes will
pay for board and lodging and
entertainment—looks like a pretty
good week to me (pity I can't spare
the time.)
If anyone's interested, come and
see me for details, before February
24th.

Now is the time when people start to
think about becoming their
department's representative for the
next academic year. Being a "Dep
Rep" is a good way to get involved
in student matters—and to achieve
results that really benefit the people
in your department. Before standing
for the post (election papers will be
going up in all departments—except
Management Science and Social and
Economic Studies—within a couple of
weeks) you should find out just what
it involves. The best way is of course,
to talk to your current Dep Rep, but
here's a brief guide.
The Dep Rep is elected by all the
students in the department by secret
ballot, to look after their academic
and social welfare and represent their
interests.
Dep Rep duties include: organising
the staff-student committee, providing
general communication between staff
and students, and following up
academic complaints and problems;
organising the department's social
lite—freshers dinners, parties,
common room facilities, etc; running
elections for academic and social reps
in each year—and working with them;
helping to organise open days and
admissions days; writing about your
department for the alternative
prospectus; representing the students
in Union affairs and channelling
information between the Unions (both
CCU and ICU) and your department.
As well as the staff-student
committee, the Dep Reps sit on the
Academic Affairs Committee of their
CCU and IC Union; they take part in
the CCU General Committee and IC
Union Council. In some departments
they are also directly involved in the
departmental society and safety
committees.
This may sound like a lot of time
in meetings but all are important.
Academic Affairs Committees give
you the opportunity to get help and
advice from other Dep Reps and to
swap tactics and ideas. Your position
on the CCU General Committee and
IC Union Council ensures that the
"ordinary students" in your
department are represented on wider
issues which directly affect them. In
order to be able to tell their students
just what is going on, Dep Reps
should also try to attend Union
General Meetings.
Anyone standing for a Dep Rep
post should realise that it doesn't just
mean working on academic problems.
A large time conirnitment is necessary
to do the job properly; you also need
to be willing to take an active interest
in what's going on around College
and in your Unions and to spread the
word around your department. The
job probably isn't as daunting as it
sounds—and one success can make it
all worthwhile.
