( III•RCU,
W A L T E R
Not. perhaps a topical comment, but
one made in earnest: Having visited
the College shop in Southside for the
first time. Walter feels that the
management are taking advantage of
a captive market by following the
grossly inflated pricing policy of an
all night newsagent without offering
the opening hours. He would be
delighted to see justification of this
published in FELIX, and he invites
comment from the said management.
Walter has just returned from
another first visit: The ULU building
in Malet Street. He respectfully asks
those who would impose funding
costs on ULU to think again. He
notices, much to his discomfort, that
the scats on the gents lavatories in the
building stand only nine inches high,
and given the high price of porcelain,
any further shortage of money could
result in patrons being confronted,
like the rural French, by a mere hole
in the floor, a prospect which Walter
regards with distaste.
Walter observes that Valentine's
day is imminent once more—a day,
as they say, for sweethearts and lovers
everywhere. He would be pleased to
accept Valentine's day cards, and
request that they should be addressed
c/o The Editor.
A brief thought—Walter wonders
if Mr David Burbage, Chairman of
ConSoc. celebrates February 14th for
the romance or because of the
massacre.. .but we digress.
It is noticeable that Spanker
Howgate has been keeping a low
profile lately—Walter did hear some
rumour that he was starting a degree
in Geology, but, of course, we must
discount rumours.
A final thought on February
14th—Walter would like to wish the
RSM rugby team the best of luck in
their 'bottle match' against Camborne
School of Mines.
Viva Bessemer!
