News. FELIX, Friday February 13th 1987 20
Conman still at large
The conman who stole £500 from a
Linstead resident at the beginning of
term (see FELIX. Friday February
6th) is still at large. Last week an IC
student was approached by the man
whilst walking between Queensgate
and Gloucester Road. The student
was asked »for £1,100 and offerred
two watches and a bracelet, which he
was told were made of gold, for
security. The man's story was that he
had all his money pinched in a casino
and needed to get home; he speaks
with a French accent.
The man is described as being
around forty years old, of dark
brownish complexion with a broad
face. He was wearing a grey suit and
driving a white car, possibly an
Austin-Rover, which he said was
hired.
Anyone who is approached by this
man should contact College security
chief Geoffrey Reeves immediately.
UGC to dissolve
Kenneth Baker, Secretary of State for
Education has welcomed a report
calling for the dissolution of the
University Grants Committee. The
report of the Croham Committee,
published on Tuesday, recommends
that the UGC be replaced by a smaller
Council.
The Croham Report also
recommends that Universities receive
funding on a three year basis, with no
cuts during each period except in
times of national emergency.
Amongst the other key
recommendations of the report are a
re-appraisal of negotiating
arrangements for academic salaries
and a re-examination of the funding
for medical education.
The proposed University Grants
Council would be chaired, suggests
the report, by 'an eminent figure from
outside the academic world', assisted
by a full time Director General, who
would act as Accounting Officer for
grants to universities, and a formal
document detailing the relationship
between the Government and the
UGC would be drawn up.
It's the thought that counts
The National Union of Students has
been protesting vigorously against the
introduction of student loans over the
last few weeks. The highlight of the
campaign was to have been to padlock
executive members to a large pyramid
structure entitled 'Debt'.
The NUS President, Vicky Phillips,
was to have symbolically unlocked
them with a key labelled "Living
Grant', all of which was planned to
take place outside 10 Downing Street.
Unfortunately the construction team
built 'Debt' out of papier-mache and
only realised that it was too big to get
out of the door on the morning of the
event. As an NUS spokesman put it
later, "so great is the debt around
students' necks they can't even get out
of doors in the morning!"
'Secret Society' screened
A reporter from FELIX was among
a large audience who saw a screening
of the banned BBC film "Secret
Society" on Monday evening. The
event was organised by the Campaign
for Press and Broadcasting Freedom
at Conway Hall, near Holborn. The
meeting was later addressed bya
series of speakers including Mrs Ann
Clywd MP and Mr Tony Benn MP
who have both been involved in
protests over the Zircon censorship
scandal.
Mr Duncan Campbell, the
journalist who made the film, was
unable to be present during the actual
screening due to an injunction. A
fuller report of the program will
appear in FELIX next week.
PG Handbook
published
The Postgraduate Handbook for 1987
was published this week. The
handbook is aimed at final year
students at IC who are thinking of
postgraduate study here. It contains
information on how to apply, funding
and eligibility for grants and fees. It
also features a section written by
current postgraduates, both MSc's
and PhD's, at the College, and is
intended to give a student's idea of
what it is like to be a Postgraduate at
Imperial. Special sections included
this year are chapters on Postgraduate
life as a woman, and as an overseas
student.
Copies are available free from the
Union office, and it is hoped that they
also can be distributed around the
Departments very shortly.
ULU March
A march to the headquarters of the
UGC will take place later this month.
The march, which is part of the
University of London Union's cam-
paign against the proposed cut in cen-
tral funding, will be addressed by
NUS President Vicky Phillips, and
will leave the ULU building at about
noon on the 26th of February. ULU
President Jane Cannon told FELIX
that the route, from Malet Street to
Park Crescent, has been approved by
the police, and she urged students to
give their support to the campaign.
Storm in a pot
The RCSU's "three-handled pot"
disappeared mysteriously last Friday
during the RCS Annual Dinner, held
at the London International Hotel on
Cromwell Road. The pot was
discretely returned, via Sherfield
Security, on Saturday.
Can't make
waves
Imperial College Radio's medium
wave transmitter was shut down on
Wednesday night. The transmitter,
which is housed in a service duct
below Southside, was damaged by
water leaking from a pipe.
Technical Manager Dave Stanley
told FELIX that he expects to have
the transmitter repaired in time to go
back on air this Saturday evening. IC
Radio is continuing with its normal
programming meanwhile, and can
still be heard over the network system
in many parts of College.
Strong social
Habits
The Student Accommodation Office
has reported a very strong response
to the Social Habits Survey. By
Wednesday morning the number of
replies received had already exceeded
peak predictions. With some returns
still to filter through the internal mail
next week the organisers are facing
the problem that the original computer
system selected for processing the
statistics may be unable to cope.
Reaction to the questionnaire appears
to have been very positive with only
a few forms incomplete or spoiled.
Under starters
orders
The sabbatical election papers went
up yesterday, and already several
candidates have put their names up.
The only post with more than one
candidate is that of FELIX editor,
with Chris Edwards (Chemistry) and
Judith Hackney (Physics) standing.
For the other posts, the following
people have put their names up: Bill
Goodwin (Mechanical Engineering)
for President, Alan Rose (Dept. of
Computing) for Deputy President,
and Chas Jackson (Chemical
Engineering) for Honorary Secretary.
UGM
postponed
Tuesday's Union General Meeting
was postponed because of a lack of
publicity. The ICU Executive decided
to move the UGM to Tuesday of next
week (February 17th), at 1.00pm in
the Great Hall.
