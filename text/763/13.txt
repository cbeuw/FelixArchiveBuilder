Sailing, Sunday 8th
February, Queen Mary
Reservoir
Great combination
Last Sunday the IC sailing team
wound their way to Queen Mary
reservoir, by Heathrow, for a match
against The City University. Despite
the blustery conditions and unfamiliar
boats, the IC team won in convincing
style, putting up their best
performance of the season so far. In
a series of races that lasted all day,
the team won 8 races against City's
2. The first race set the scene with
good work from helms Charles
Oxley, Apostolous Leonhidopolous,
and Richard Brimelow creating an
unbeatable 1, 2, 3 combination. With
aggressive starting tactics and
superior boat speed the teams,
encouraged by Captain Sam Page,
improved thoughout the day to win 5
of the 10 races sailed, with a 1, 2, 3
combination. (What is a 1, 2, 3,
combination ?)
Team: Sam Page (Capt),
Richard Brimelow, Charles Oxley,
Richard Jarman, Apostolous
Leonhidopolous.
Badminton —
Hammersmith Leagues
Mixed luck in leagues
for IC teams
Mens
After a very promising start to our
first season in Hammersmith Division
3 our luck has changed, since the 3
matches played so far this term have
only yielded one victory. They were
crucial matches as well, and it now
looks as though IC are out of the
running for promotion.
The slide started against Acton,
whom we convincingly beat last term,
on their courts. It was a combination
of not having a full team and lack of
(practise from the team as a whole.
However, despite our firsts having no
trouble winning all of their 3 rubbers
Acton still made short work of our
remaining pairs to win 6-3.
The slide continued 2 days later
when we were beaten 6-3 by
Spartans—surely the favourites for
promotion. IC played better than they
had in the match before, but could
only manage victories against the
visitors' third pair.
The following day we hit back with
a vengence by thrashing Friday Night
9:0. It was a different standard of
badminton—much lower—but a 9:0
victory may be vitally important
should IC beat Spartans in return.
Mixed
The mixed is a bit of a foregone
conclusion this year. Our team is too
strong for the division we have been
put in and this is reflected in the
results. IC have won every match
except one (the result of having 2
matches on the same night) and every
victory (7 in all) has been 9:0 (again,
except one, which we won 5:4 having
only had 2 pairs!)
This term is no exception as our
opponents have found—Grange a..'
Richmond both being thrashed by the
above margin.
The mixed team should not have
much problem maintaining this form
for their last 2 matches.
Football
IC 2nd XI 7, QMC II 7
pure poetry
Tension was high (Wos it—Ed) in this
crunch game, as 4 points were up for
the taking. A 2nd XI led by the
charismatic Captain Neil McDonald
quickly took control. After some
fluent play M Housby pounced on a
through ball and slid the ball past the
keeper, to make the score 1-0.
With Paul Stott in powerful form
in attack, IC swept forward and
claimed more goals. Stott's clever
cross pinpointed to the head
(Ouch!—Ed) of a QMC defender who
thundered the ball past his helpless
goalkeeper. (Phew! what a
paragraph).
Another goal by Housby,
complemented a fine low drive by
Scott Gordon and a 20 yard cracker
from Jez Holland. A dubious penalty
decision after D Demeria, who
controlled the right flank, had
allegedly pushed a QMC player,
allowed QMC to pull a goal back.
IC entered the second half with the
crowd firmly behind them. They
Football, Saturday

added to their tally after a glorious
move. P Stott, after a display of
silken, elegant skills chipped the ball
to Scott Gordon in the box, who
headed the ball back for the Captain,
Neil McDonald, to volley home
emphatically. 6-1 to IC.
QMC rallied and only excellent
play from S Dunthorne in defence and
the tenacious Dave Viles in midfield
prevented QMC pulling a goal back.
J Wireford was called upon to make
some important saves to deny QMC.
The game was sealed by M Housby
completing his hatrick after D Viles,
D Semera, P Scott and Scott Gordon
had created numerous chances.
So IC march 'on' up the division
'and' prepare 'for' the cup semi-final
on 'Saturday'. M Barrow is '73'.
Team: J Wreford, C Gordon, J
Holland, S Dunthorne, Ken
Holroyd, N McDonald (Capt), D
Viles, Scott Gordon, D Semera, M
Housby, Paul Scott.
On Saturday the 3rds travelled to New
College in Egham for their Upper
Reserves Cup Semi-final. Their
opponents, Goldsmiths 2nds,
although a division higher, had not
won a league game all season; the
game was going to be close.
IC 3rds quickly grabbed the
initiative with sweeping breaks down
the left, embarrassing our opponents'
full-back and whipping in some good
crosses. Goldsmiths were restricted
to a few swift counter-attacks, dealt
with cooly by the 3rds defence.
Having forced a succession of comers
Kevin Graves went close, shooting
wide with only the keeper to beat. The
same player had a second chance a
moment later, but was unlucky to be
'offside'. Wendel Charles and Martin
Dixon made intelligent running, ably
supported by the bustling Paul
Thompson and Mark Radley
providing width on the right.
Tremendous team football forced a
goal, but it was disallowed for a rather
dubious offside decision. Goldsmith's
responded well with an opportunist
goal; a tow-poke shot past a deceived
Mike Kemp.
1-0 down at half-time, the 3rds
surged forward in the second half.
Kevin Graves turned and chipped
superbly, only to be denied by a
tremendous flying save. Two Paul
Thompson cross-shots were similarly
thwarted. Kevin Graves and Russ
Dark headed over and Martin Lake
shot just wide from the edge of the
box. Tempers flared mid-way through
the second half and Chris Gordon
won his own personal battle with his
opponent. After a running-down-the-
touchline boxing match, he seemed to
blow a fuse and buckled his opponent
from behind with a calculated blow
to the shin. The absence of the ball
seemed irrelevant. Justice was done,
however, as Goldsmith scored
directly from the resulting free-kick.
Wendel Charles was bundled down
in the box but claims for a penalty
were ignored. Having virtually
camped in our opponent's half and
creating numerous chances more, it
was not to be our day; Goldsmith's
goalkeeper made another fine save to
secure the match. A great team
performance partially covered our
disappointment, but everybody played
above themselves and thoroughly
enjoyed a fast, competitive game of
football. Thanks to Hideo Takans,
who came to support us despite his
recently acquired broken leg, for his
vocal comments and also Chris
Redgen, cruelly denied an appearance
in the team due to injury, for his
support also.
A game to be remembered by all
on a day when lady luck wasn't there
to help us get the win we deserved.

Gordon, Martin Lake, Mark
Woodgate (C), Russ Dark, Mike
Plummer, Paul Thompson, Kevin
Graves, Mark Radley, Wendel
