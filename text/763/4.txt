Letters. FELIX, Friday February 13th 1987
The Odd
Couple?
Dear Dave,
I wonder if any of your readers
noticed the resemblance between
Peter Goosen (IC Amnesty Chairman)
and Simon Bosher (Third Secretary
of the South African Embassy). I
wonder if they are somehow related.
Your ever faithful servant,
Ena B Maxwell.
Foolish biker
Dear Dave,
The Irate Biker who complained
about having his lights taken for the
night and then returned is a fool who
deserves to have not only his lights
but his whole bike stolen and never
returned. Someone should point out
to him that the £1.80 he paid in bus
fares is a lot less than the cost of
buying a new set of lights and
batteries, and if it teaches him never
to leave his lights unattended again,
he should consider it money well
spent.
Yours sincerely,
Security-Conscious Student
P.S. Buy my next week's shopping
at Sainsbury's?
Question of
morals
Dear Dave,
On behalf of the Christian Union
I would like to draw to your attention
how the recent Welfare survey fails
to provide a "truly complete picture
of the IC student population." We
understand such a survey is necessary
but many of us have found it assuming
in regards to the behaviour of students
here. This mostly concerns Q.21
which gives no option to state whether
one not is in a sexual relationship at
the moment, except by not answering
the question and so leaving room for
speculation.
Some have also found the options
for answer in Q.17 (that on the
reasons why one doesn't drink)
incomplete. It neglects that some
people find simply the taste of alcohol
displeasing or moral grounds rather
than religious ones (there is a
distinction) can cause some not to
drink.
The question of morals must also
be raised with the issue of sex and
drugs. The opportunity to state one's
morals to the question of drink is
given but not for that of sex or drugs.
Although Welfare may have good
reasons to do this we are concerned
that drugs and especially sex are
presented outside of any moral
context.
Please understand that we know
that this survey was hurriedly
produced and went out before the
Exec could review it. I do hope
though that these feelings will be
noted and taken into account for
further such surveys.
Yours sincerely,
Steve Clark, ICCU.
Disco
Fiasco
Dear Dave,
Having been to the Southside disco
last Friday, run, supposedly, by "4th
Day of the Week," we would like to
have said what a refeshing change it
was from the normal inane "dance
around a handbag" drivel that we're
usually confronted with.
And so it was, until 9.45pm. At
least several of us thought it was.
Apparently several IC Radio hacks
did not. They took offence to the
alternative type of music being played
(which they obviously were not
familiar with—so how could it
possibly be any good?) which was
apparently not inspiring enough
people to dance. Two of them
proceeded to take over the disco,
returning to old relics such as Tainted
Love. Blue Monday and various other
blasts from the past.
Isn't it about time our IC Radio
friends took off their blinkers and
realised there is life outside of a few
"played to death" records from the
top 20. If IC Radio do ciaim the
dancing increased later on due to their
divine intervention I suggest they go
to IC discos more often. The vast
majority of people end up dancing
after 10.30pm anyway.
Far from turning the disco into
something better. IC Radio have only
revealed their narrow-mindedness
which caused several people to leave
early rather than stay.

Rant 1
To the Editor,
Comments on last week's FELIX.
1) Why doesn't that prat 'Mark' the
cartoonist fuck off.
2) You demonstrate a complete pig
ignorance of the situation in South
Africa by the use of the term
'coloured' in last week's editorial
which I'm afraid is rather typical of
many people who are apparently so
concerned about the situation in that
country. The term 'coloured' applies
to people of mixed black-white
parentage. The terms 'black' and
'white' and 'Asian' are self
explanatory, Using the term
'coloured' in the context it appears in
the editorial implies a certain lack of
respect for people who are not as
white as yourself.
3) Nosmo King's letter was by far
the best letter 1 have seen in FELIX
this or any year. It's a pity there aren't
more like them (including this one).
Yours sincerely,
Mike Jones, Mining Geology PC
Rant 2
Dear Dave,
A rewrite of my first letter to you
which, having spoken to you, was
overly critical and I apologise. Please
feel free to publish both (or neither
as you see fit!)
Having spent ten months of the past
two years of my life in South Africa
one of the things that incenses me
during discussion of the situation in
that country is the arbitary use of such
terms as 'black' and 'coloured'. I
appreciate now that you used the term
'coloured' in last week's editorial as
a result of a need for editorial brevity.
It did however create a rather naive
and uncaring impression of your
understanding of racial problems in
South Africa and even this country.
In multiracial societies it is
unfortunate that there is a problem of
describing groups of people of
different skin colour. Non-white
(another terrible term I'm afraid)
people I have worked with in South
Africa and the UK cannot abide being
lumped together in one racial group
even for the sake of brevity and they
are extremely sensitive about it. In
South Africa the racial situation is
extremely complex and not just a
simple 'black vs white' problem.
There are several other racial groups
in South Africa who seem to get
overlooked in the general hurry to get
on the "solidarity with black South
Africans" bandwagon and it is that
sort of attitude of complete ignorance
of the problems facing South Africa
that is annoying. I realise it was not
your intention to create the impression
you did. and I regret having thought
it was. but I feel it illustrates how
careful one must be when
commenting on such sensitive issues.
On a lighter note, I still stand by
my remark concerning "Mark" the
cartoonist who is extremely tedious
and Nosmo King's letter which is still
the best letter I've read in FELIX.
Yours,
Mike Jones

Abhorent
Dear Dave,
I, John Noble, find the practice of
writing letters to FELIX just to get
one's name in print quite abhorent.
Yours,
John Noble.

This subject is perhaps a bit heavy
for the FELIX Valentine's Day
issue—but while everyone's thoughts
turn to love (am I kidding? Does
anyone think of anything else?) it
seems relevant.
In 1985, 37 men were imprisoned
for an average of 22 months for
having consensual sex. All the men
were over 21, and had had some kind
of sexual involvement with men of an
age between 16 and 21. Why?
Becuase the age of consent for
homosexual men is 21.
This crime doesn't exist for
heterosexuals or lesbians (a historical
accident—reputedly Queen Victoria
didn't believe there was such a thing
as a lesbian. Incidentally this also
shows how out-dated the law is).
A recent court case heard that 2
policemen spent 3 hrs in the men's
toilet of a gay club when they were
in fact meant to be out on the beat.
The judge threw the case out. It's a
shame the two policemen couldn't
have been out on the beat trying to
convict muggers instead of tyring to
convict innocent people.
Have you ever wondered why you
never see gay men and women
walking hand-in-hand? Surely, it's the
most natural thing for lovers to do?
The reason is that this is also iliegal
under public decency laws.
Last year when a man and women
stripped in public and proceded to
engage in intercourse local residents
called the police and the couple were
"moved on" and not charged—and
yet gay men are spied upon in private.
(Incidently a locked hotel room is not
considered "private" within the law).
So, when you are having fun this
weekend spare a thought for
"harrassed-homos" and give him a
.kiss from me.
Love Robert.
