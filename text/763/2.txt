Letters. FELIX, Friday February 13th 1987 2
Victims no
more
Dear Dave,
I am sure that on reading the letter
(FELIX 762) by the young woman
who had experienced an abortion,
that, many people will have been
moved by its expression of anger and
personal pain. The title "Victims of
Abortion," to which she referred, for
the talk by Olivia Gans, was chosen
by Olivia herself and not PATA. She
used this title because she had found
that most women, including herself,
had had little perception of many of
the personal consequences of having
an abortion. For instance, she
revealed that recent research in the
US has produced strong evidence
indicating that intense psychological
suffering and harm—technically
termed Post Abortion Syndrome—is
often inflicted on women through
abortion. The symptoms of PAS vary
in degree from person to person but
are often severe and frequently only
come to the surface with the onset of
menopause. The syndrome, she said,
is aggravated by society's refusal to
allow discussion of the experience of
abortion; so that women cannot 'talk
it through'. Olivia also paid tribute to
post abortion counselling; this is
offered only by the charity LIFE in
this country.
PATA believes that if a woman is
given the opportunity to receive non-
directive counselling, sufficient
medical, financial, emotional and
legal help—including advice on
adoption—then she will be able to
choose a positive alternative both for
herself and her child. There should
be no need for a woman to throw
away her life on a child, nor to kill
the child in order to avoid doing so.
We are promoting these positive
alternatives because we perceive a
real need for them to be made more
widely available.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Rice, Secretary PATA.
Buyers
beware
Dear Sir,
I am writing to inform members of
the College of the action taken by the
Rembrandt Hotel against IC students
at the end of last term. Garden Hall
had planned to hold its annual
Christmas dinner at the Rembrandt
Carvery, and had arranged the visit
weeks in advance. The carvery meal
which the Rembrandt and other
similar hotels offer, means that
customers help themselves to a
selection of food in the line of a
traditional roast dinner. The standard'
deal means that patrons can eat as
much as they want.
In previous years, parties from both
Weekes and Garden Halls had found
out well into the meal that seconds
were not to be made available to
them, and the staff and management
of the Hotel openly shouted at the
group when complaints were made.
A couple of days before this year's
meal, the Warden of Garden tried to
obtain a written guarantee that these
events would not recur. At this point,
the management of the Rembrandt
refused, making the claim that all IC
groups had abused the carvery in the
last year, adding that Imperial College
students each too much! They said
that for this reason it had been decided
that parties from IC would not be
given the standard carvery deal, even
though they were paying full price.
The Warden was so astounded by the
claim that he made the staff member
repeat it several times. The hall dinner
had to be moved to the Regent Place
Hotel (Picadilly Circus) which was
more than satisfactory—we know
where to go next time!
Obviously IC groups are not
welcome at the Rembrandt, so parties
wishing a full carvery deal should
look elsewhere.
Yours,
Mark Salisbury.
Question
time
Dear Dave,
After reading Shaun Dunlop's letter
in last week's FELIX I felt it was
necessary for me to reply as
Chairman of WellSoc.
WellSoc has never been afraid of
being controversial in choosing the
topics of the lectures it organises
weekly. Indeed, we feel it is
important at times to be so and our
best meetings this year have been the
most controversial. It is for people
who disagree with the topic to come
to the meetings, to hear what the
speaker has to say and to question the
speaker at the end of the talk.
Unfortunately, to the best of my
knowledge, Mr Dunlop did not attend
the lecture given by Professor
Eysenck. Had he done so he would
have heard an extremely interesting
talk, totally lacking in the "racial
nonsense" he wrote about in FELIX.
Although WellSoc is apolitical, we
object strongly to the form of
intellectual censorship which I believe
Mr Dunlop was attempting to
practise. Members of the College
have every right to hear differing
points of view; if every speaker
invited by WellSoc was putting
forward a view held by everybody
then WellSoc meetings would be
pointless.
I totally support the decision of the
External Secretary to invite Professor
Eysenck to lecture.

Speaking of politics
Dear Editor,
I would like to express my disgust
at the political naivety which seems
rife amongst students of all ages at
Imperial. The formulation of this
view has nothing to do with the ICU
Exec or its clashes with College on
important issues—although I lose as
much sleep as the next man over
where my next burger is coming
from. Instead, in my first few months
at IC, I have come across many
examples of the complete failure of
students to appreciate the big, wide
world of politics and its effect on all
our future lives. For instance, there
seems little or no awareness of the
plight of UK manufacturing industry
amongst the 'rank and file' students
of IC, most of whom will end up in
industry. Just at a time when many
students (including myself) are
forming a political identity there is
little or no useful 'input data' with
which to work. Since newspapers and
TV are now awash with political
misinformation it would be helpful if
College provided a balanced, well-
informed environment in which
students could discuss and decide for
themselves what politics were 'good
polities'.
For this reason I would like to
condemn Leon Brittan's address to a
Conservative Association meeting last
week. (Letter submitted last
week—Ed). His speech rather cheaply
sought to win a handful of first-time
voters and not only insulted the
intelligence of the audience (was he
reading a Sun editorial?) but also
showed a grave lack of
responsibility—should a senior
politician (of whichever persuasion)
try to brain-wash or educate and
inform a gathering of supposedly
intelligent students? The gullibility of
students to sit and swallow such
electioneering tripe without so much
as a whimper and the Association's
chairman to invite such a thoughtless
speaker is, in my view, not
encouraging a mature attitude to
politics. I would not be surprised to
find the chairman of the Socialist
Society acting with a similarly
blinkered view of what service he
should be providing. I suggest such
bodies stop patting themselves on the
back for getting 'big names' to
College and start thinking about what
their speakers talk about.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Bullen, Elec Eng I
In praise of Goosen
Dear Sir,
I am writing with reference to Kemi
Adenubi's letter (FELIX 762)
concerning the South African
Government's incursions into
neighbouring countries harbouring
members of the terrorist wing.
Terrorism identifies the perpetrators
as legitimate targets and I whole
heartedly agree with Mr Goosen's
view that they should be killed as
efficiently as possible. Neighbouring
states must learn the price of
supporting terrorism and if this means
violating international law, then so be
it.
We must be careful not to confuse
the morality of apartheid with the
morality of countering terrorism; a
distinction which seemed to escape
the FELIX opinion article. As Mr
Goosen pointed out, the A N C
violence is largely directed at the
black populace, hence the security
forces are not the only source of
intimidation and oppression. The
situation has some parallels with
sectarian violence in Northern
Ireland; if our forces withdrew this
violence would no doubt escalate.
Likewise, if the South African
Government collapsed the ANC
might choose to rule by force of the
gun, with no real chance of reform
thereafter, as probably would the IRA
in Northern Ireland.
Furthermore, M r Adenubi's
(Miss—Ed) statement that "suspected
IRA terrorists must be extradited"
might imply to him that South Africa
is "high handed". In my opinion it
merely highlights the inadequacies in
our own fight against terrorism. The
time has come for our Government to
take a stance comparable to that of
South Africa and Israel, tracking these
murderers down and killing them
whether by trial and execution or in
the field. Currently we lack even the
death penalty.
I reserve my final comments for a
number of the Anti-apartheid
demonstrators, specifically those who
labelled Mr Goosen and his
supporters racist. This was,
undoubtedly, not because he was
South African, but because he was
white and South African. Had a
member of the black South African
community been invited I'm sure
these same demonstrators would have
been happy to listen. Consider then,
who are the racists?
Yours sincerely,
Mike Allen, Physics I.
