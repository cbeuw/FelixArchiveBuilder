1 . A p o l o g i e s
For changing the date of this meeting. Due to several technical hitches the
publicity wasn't out in time for last week and we felt it was better to postpone
and let people know what was going on.
2 . J u n i o r C o m m o n R o o m
Since the boycott, the Union's arguments appear to be taken seriously by
College. There is now a new dimension in that College appear more willing
to carry on with the original plan to swap the JCR and Main Dining Hall.
Also arising from the recent discussions comes a new long term plan—to build
a NEW JCR in the same building as an indoor sports hall (which will have
to be provided when the current volleyball court is demolished. I believe this
is a good plan and attach a proposal to look into it further, which was accepted
by the College Governor's Finance and Executive committees. If this long
term plan is accepted then our interim plans must be reviewed. (See paper
appended).
Recommendation: That this UGM supports the plan for a new JCR as
outlined below and that this plan becomes long term Union Policy.
If this recommendation is passed, there are several interim options. Briefly,
these are:
(i) to press for the original plan to go ahead ie have the JCR and Dining
Hall swapped.
(ii) to go for complete control of QT and the JCR bar.
(iii) to go for financial compensation for loss of conference related income,
either as profit share or a linked subvention increase.
(iv) to go for control of the JCR bar plus financial compensation as above.
Options (i) and ii) are both fairly long term; the work to be done to swap
the rooms would not be complete for over a year; and the Union's management
structure would need improving before we could handle QT.
I hope there will be much discussion of these options at the UGM however
my recommendation is as follows:
Recommendation: That the Union presses for full control of the JCR bar
and financial compensation for loss of conference related income until such
time as a new JCR, under Union control, becomes usable.
3 . W o r l d U n i v e r s i t y S e r v i c e
The motion on the Union's support of WUS is up for renewal at the UGM.
I believe this is a very worthwhile charity and would like to propose that we
extend our support beyond a simple annual collection. I would like to look
into setting up a campus scholarship to pay for a Third World student to study
at IC.
4 . E n t e r t a i n m e n t s C o m m i t t e e
Following many complaints about this year's Ents Committee I have looked
into their budget and discovered that Ents have not in fact lost any money
overall this year. I have asked Dan Phillips to report on his activities to Council
on Monday 16th Feb.
5 . L e s b i a n a n d G a y W e l f a r e
ICU Council voted to co-opi Robert Daniel to look into the problems facing
lesbian and gay students and to provide information and advice. Council can
co-opt people as necessary to look at any specific issue and report back. Robert
now has speaking rights at Council but not a vote as he was not elected.
6 . J o b D e s c r i p t i o n s
I now have a job description, of sorts, for all central Union posts including
Dep Reps. Anyone thinking of standing, see me and I'll let you have a copy.
7 . W e l f a r e Q u e s t i o n n a i r e
There have been several comments and complaints about the welfare
questionnaire. Whilst we accept that it isn't perfect, it still needs to be treated
seriously. If the Union and College are to provide a realistic welfare service
we need this sort of information.
8 . A I D S
(i) Professor Anderson of the Biology department has asked to circulate
another more detailed survey to all students as part of his research into the
spread of AIDS through the community. I would ask everybody to cooperate
fully in this venture.
(ii) It is widely felt that the government's campaign on AIDS is inadequate,
relying on doom laden imagery and short on facts. AIDS does affect everyone
including us therefore it seems necessary to provide some factual advice about
it.
Recommendation: That the Union, in conjunction with Lesley Gillingham,
prepare and distribute information and advice about AIDS.
9 . R e s i d e n c e s
(i) Re-apps The decision to halve the number of re-applicant places in halls
was a desperate one, but unavoidable if rooms are to be found for all next
year's freshers.
(ii) New Places No news on the Evelyn Gardens houses yet. However, it
appears that the College are finally setting up a mechanism for acquiring new
property—unfortunately the benefits won't be apparent until next year.

V o l l e y b a l l C o u r t
College Maintenance have finally got round to doing the 'urgent' repairs
to the floor which have been needed since the start of last term. There seems
to have been a general reluctance to spend money on this doomed area. As
it will need to be used for probably the next five years I think this running
down period may have started just a mite too soon! As with the other Union
room or gym, if you notice any defect let me know.
S e l f - d e f e n c e C o u r s e
A second course will start on March 2nd. I have sent letters to everyone
still on the Union office list with details. There will probably not be any spare
places, but if any woman wished to add her name to the list, can she see Kath
in the office.
M o n e y
We have just received two cheques: one from the bookshop, for £7,500.
The three CCU's will each receive £1,500, and ICU £3,000.
The second was from the College's Conference Office for £17,230.53, for
JCR lettings, of which £14,553.92 was for 1985/86.
H o n S e e ' s R e p o r t
1 . V a n s
Please can all drivers park the vans properly in the spaces provided just
inside the barrier. Also please park them properly in their space. Do not park
them at funny angles, do not park them so they take up two spaces and if
our spaces are full and you have to park elsewhere then park in the unnumbered
bays.
All drivers must check oil and water levels before they drive the vans. If
you have to buy oil then buy some and take it off your overall bill. These
vans are the Unions and when they don't run you complain often enough,
so help make sure they stay on the road.
Some vans have recently been for major repairs, and no doubt more will
be going in the future. With a little bit of care and decent driving these vans
could do a lot better than they are doing and we could save a bit of money
on unnecessary items such as dented tyres etc.
2 . O u t s i d e H i r e V a n s
Booking these is not very easy and unbooking them is worse. If you wish
to cancel then you do so before Wednesday of each week, or you get a late
cancellation charge. Another thing is if you don't book before Wendesday
then if I have to book an outside hire van on Friday and I manage to (by some
miracle) then I'm thinking of not charging shared costing on a club that couldn't
get its act together.
All clubs should confirm all bookings s>t least three/four days in advance
to stop cock-ups, it's called being organised!
