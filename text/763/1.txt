G U C c o n d e m n s o c c u p a t i o n
of N o r t h e r n Ireland
The University of London's General Union Council (GUC)
passed a motion condemning the British occupation of Northern
Ireland at their meeting on Tuesday. The council felt that the
partition of Ireland into North and South went against the
wishes of the Irish people, and that Britain should commit itself
to unconditioned military withdrawal. Also criticised was the
use of plastic bullets, the 'Diplock' trials without jury, and the
use of strip searches.
The motion was passed in spite of
a passionate speech by IC Union Hon
Sec, Dave Coliey, denouncing the
atrocities committed by the INLA and
the IRA. A call by ICU External
Affairs Officer Adrian Johnson for
the motion not to be voted upon was
defeated after a recount by 5 votes.
Following the NUS condemnation
of the level of grants, the GUC
decided to adopt a policy condemning
student loans, the lack of grants for
students in further eduction, and the
'Fowler Review' which restricts the
access of students to benefits.
A motion designed to protect the
rights of AIDS sufferers to use
University and Union facilities
without discrimination was also
passed. The motion criticises the view
that AIDS is a 'gay disease' and can
be transmitted by social contact. It
states that gay people and drug users
should not be automatically debarred
from giving blood, and calls for the
Government to undertake a major
AIDS research programme.
The charity 'Quest for a Test for
Cancer' was supported, and it was
decided to send two delegates to a
tandem rally designed to raise funds
for the charity. The motion calls for
the adoption of a new cancer test
developed by Quest which could
prevent thousands of deaths from
cervical cancer. The charity is
currently trying to raise money for
twenty regional centres.
Finally a motion calling for the
resignation of the Senator for law,
responsible for representing the views
of the University of London Union
(ULU) to the University's governing
body proved highly controversial.
The Senator was criticised for not
supporting the council's views on the
ULU cuts and marches, and for the
non-attendance of meetings. Under
the council's constitution the Senator
is obliged to uphold the policies of the
GUC, though the council has no
power to sack Senators for not doing
so. The Senator said that, inspite of
the request, he had no intention of
resigning.
TV star moves in next
door to Rector
The cameras rolled on Queensgate
this Monday, as the actor Paul
Nicholas took part in Bust, a new six-
part drama series for LWT which is
to be shown in October. Mr Nicholas
plays the lead role of Neil Walsh, a
businessman who has gone bankrupt
and been evicted from his flat. A
friend offers~him a flat in Radnor
Place on Queensgate, next to the
Rector's rooms at number 170.
Mr Nicholas commented that the
first few episodes might show him
looking rather miserable, as they were
filmed in Lambeth last month when
the temperature was —7°C.
"It's almost impossible to smile
when your face is frozen stiff," he
explained, grimacing for the benefit
of our camera.
When filming in Queensgate
finishes, the crew will be moving to
Grosvenor Crescent.
