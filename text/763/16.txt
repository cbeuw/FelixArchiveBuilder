Ellis Hillman has been a Governor of
Imperial College since 1973, studied
Geology and has a maths degree from
Chelsea College. Now he is the
Principle Lecturer in Environmental
Studies at NELP and is highly
interested in "reverse imagery
exponential functions" and anti-
matter. To some he will be known for
his book "London Under London"
(1985) which describes the world
beneath our feet and under the streets,
in the form of sewers, tunnels, and
tubeways. The book won the National
Book League Prize which, ironically,
was presented to him by Geoffrey
Archer on the day after the GLC was
abolished.
He combines these facets of his life
to power an overwhelming
enthusiasm for the life and works of
Lewis Carroll, which led to him
founding the Lewis Carroll Society in
May of 1969.
Lewis Carroll, alias Charles
Lutdwidge Dodgson, was born in
Daresbury in 1832 and died in
Guildford in 1898. During his lifetime
he succeeded in creating
'wonderlands', 'dreamworlds' and
'worlds through the looking glass', all
of which have fascinated children,
adults mathematicians and logicians
alike ever since.
Never a day passes without
someone prominent, or not so
prominent, quoting from the
important classics "Alice in
Wonderland" (1865) or "Through
the Looking Glass and What Alice
Found There" (1872).
Not only did he write though, he
explored, studied and commented
upon many extraordinary changes that
were taking place in the real, as well
as the conceptual world around him.
"Alice in Wonderland" was
originally called "Alice's Adventures
Underground" but he changed this
when he heard about the building of
the inner circle line, which was the
first tube train in the world. No doubt
he did not want his imaginary world
so recently created to be so easily
found in the real one, its delicate
similies could so easily have been
smothered by a touch of reality.
He was a mathmatician, studying
his first year at Cambridge, a logician
and a clergyman. He developed
interests in photography; in particular
of children of which two original
plates were found recently, in spirit
photography phenomena and
theological speculation.
His nonsense verses such as
"Jabberwocky", and the longer
"Hunting of the Snark" (1876) have
never been equalled. But perhaps not
all his works were nonsense, theorises
Ellis Hillman. He considers the mad
hatter to be Charles Babbage, a 'mad
adder' of the time, who was then
Ecasion Professor at Cambridge. It is
written in his un-published diaries that
they met and perhaps he saw his
adding machine during this time.
Humpty Dumpty could be George
Hudson, the first person to build a
railway. The line 'Humpty Dumpty
had a great fall' referring to his
company going bust.
Finally he thinks that Tweedle Dum
and Tweedlc r >
* represent Prince
Jerome Napoleon a..J his cousin, the
more famous. Napoleon III. The
Prince often appeared in Queen
Victoria's court, causing much
amusement as he looked rather
similar.
The society, to which Ellis Hillman
remains Honorary President, has
succeeded in estabiishing a carrollian
presence in Oxford with the Oxford
Alice Society, in Daresbury. and in
the USA with the Lewis Carroll
Society of North America. It produces
a number of publications which
include: a quarterly 'Jabberwocky';
a newsletter 'The Bandersnatch':
'Colson News : Two Way Numbers':
and 'By The Totum Tree".
With the current interest in Lewis
Carroll, copies of the famous
illustrations from the books, drawn by
Sir John Tenniel, sold at Christies for
£187,000—it's hardly surprising that
he is and will be forever remembered.
Membership of the Society is open
to all and inquiries are welcome
through the Chairman and Secretary.

Musical purists have been
complaining lately about the quality
of certain compact discs from various
sixties garage bands. The digital
recordings are considered to be far
too good for the raw style of the
performances, which has has led to
the development of the new Scratch
Creator. This device synthesizes and
inserts random scratches and pressing
faults into CD recordings on playback
to give that vinyl record sound. The
machine has three settings
"Normal", "Mauled" and "Record
Library".
Language researchers over the past
few years have noticed how people on
the continent have learnt English from
records that they have been listening
to in the charts. This has caused the
development of a brand new type of
anguage course—the Linguarock
course. Famous songs are re-recordet.
with lyrics in the language that the
student wants to learn, to which they
sit down and listen.
However certain tracks have been
banned from the course due to the
content of their lyrics including the
bulk of Dead Kennedys songs,
however Cliff Richard, Bucks Fizz
and Engleburt Humperdink have been
passed fit for consumption. The
creators of the system say that they
do not want to teach their students any
bad language, and point out that they
have changed many of the existing
yrics as most songs say very little on
subjects like finding lost umbrellas
and buying train tickets.
Socio Holidays is a brand new
company that has set itself up to offer
a whole range of different vacations.
To start off their project they have
taken over a redundant steelworks in
Corby, and are offering working
holidays there making steel tube at the
price of £75 a week.
Asked why they felt such holidays
were so in demand, Mike Sale, the
organiser, replied: "People have
become very conscious of how they
spend their leisure time, and that in
this computer-controlled age, should
be looking for activities that are more
productive. These holidays should be
particuarly productive for
Sociologists and Environmental
Planners to find out about how they
feel they should be living."
One of those well-known facts about
students is that they smoke marijuana
whenever they get the opportunity.
However the truth is far more
mundane than this; which is why an
old incense manufacturing firm has
come up with the idea of grass
flavoured joss-sticks. So now< students
can impress their friends with 'that
smell' without fear of being raided by
the boys in blue.
