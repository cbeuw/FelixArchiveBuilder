W h e n the W i n d Blows
When the Wind Blows is a powerful
and moving film that leaves you
feeling totally useless. Written, by
Raymond Briggs, who wrote The
Snowman, the film tells the story of
Jim and Hilda Bloggs, a supposedly
typical elderly couple who lived
through the last world war and are
now faced with the prospect 6f a
nuclear war.
It is an animated film and so some
might expect it to be less frightening
than say Threads or The Day After.
Well this certainly isn't the case as the
many people who left the cinema in
tears would testify. Indeed, Sir John
Mills and Dame Peggy Ashcroft, who
are the voices of Jim and Hilda are
said to have cried after watching it.
The film doesn't seek to put across
any political views but insteud
chooses to deal with real people (well,
almost real), and to show the utter
hopelessness of the man in the street
when faced with the ultimate terror
of nuclear war.
Jim Bloggs, who is retired, is the
definitive respectable citizen. He is
completely un-questionning of the
government and so when an
"international crisis" starts to get
worse, Jim runs off to the public
library to get his copy of "Protect and
Survive." Here, Briggs brings out the
glaring inadequacies of this
publication to great effect. You find
yourself laughing loudly as Jim tries
hopelessly to follow the instructions,
but then realise that it isn't funny.
A beautiful example of this is when
Jim, much to the dismay of Hilda,
takes off all the doors to build the
"shelter" and is then told a few pages
later to keep all the doors shut to
minimise the effects of the blast!
The only criticism that could be
levelled at this moving film is that the
two characters, Jim and Hilda, are
slightly overdone, maybe just a little
too naive, a bit too ignorant for belief.
Are there really any people left who
are oblivious of the horrors of nuclear
war and think that the next war will
be just like the last—we'll be alright
if we all pull together.
Jim and Hilda totally underestimate
the power and long-term effects of
"the bomb" and are surprised when
the paper boy doesn't arrive the day
after telling them who won.
I think that if the characters were
a little less ignorant and a little more
believable then the film would be
more powerful (if that's possible).
Despite this exaggerated ignorance,
or maybe because of it, you can't help
caring about Jim and Hilda and you
leave the cinema feeling that you
really know them and this makes what
happens to them all the more
heart-rending.
The film has a chilling end that
leaves the audience stunned into
silence. There's no stampede at the
sight of the titles and it's an eerie
situation as everyone just sits in their
seats staring blankly at the titles
scrolling up with the hauntingly
brilliant song by Roger Waters, that
accompanies them, blasting out. A
very moving film

Boy Soldier
Milwr Bychan (Boy Soldier) is a
rarety—a film in which much of the
dialogue is in the Welsh language
with English sub-titles.
Wil is a young soldier in Northern
Ireland who is charged with murder,
a 'crime' which he has been trained
to commit. However, it soon becomes
clear that Wil is being punished for
falling in love with a Catholic Irish
girl and because of his disillusionment
with the army—his South Wales
background is similar to the Irish and
he soon realises that he is fighting for
the wrong side.
Karl Francis' film is low budget
and unpolished which enhances the
cutting edge to the brutal story of
Wil's treatment by the army.
To a non-Welsh speaker the film
may seem simply 'anti-army',
however I felt that, through the
untranslated inuendos of the Welsh
language, the story was an allegory
of the English oppression of the
Welsh. This point is arguable but the
fact that Milwr Bychan sets out to
demonstrate the huge cultural divide
between the English and Welsh is not.
Wil can put up barriers against his
officers by retreating into his native
tongue, which is natural to him but
incomprehensible to them.
The distribution of such a radical
film would normally be considered
brave, the fact that it is in a language
spoken by only a few thousand people
makes it unique.

Ferris Bueller's Day Off
A film about staying cool in Chicago
whilst constantly on the edge of big
trouble. Ferris Bueller's Day Off
merits more than a few hearty
chuckles; its liveliness owes a lot to
the casting of Matthew Brokerick of
War Games fame as Ferris, who
coincidently is a computer genius
amongst his other talents.
Bueller bunks off high school for
a day and get his girlfriend out to join
him by convincing the headmaster
that her grandmother has died. He
then persuades his best friend to take
his dad's prized old classic 250GT red
Ferrari out and there ensues a day of
fast living freedom oiled by Bueller's
ability for quick thinking and
spending money to maximum
enjoyment. The dismal attempts of his
headmaster to catch him are
constantly thwarted as he has as much
bad luck as Ferris has good.
Don't be put off by the names of
Ferris and his friends Sloane and
Cameron (!)—it is too unpredictable
a film to be classed as run of the mill
American drivel. It can be seen to be
a film about life, liberty and the
pursuit of personal freedom and it is
good for a change to see someone
with money who really knows how to
spend it. Viv Watson.
