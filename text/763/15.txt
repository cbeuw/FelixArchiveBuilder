Opinion- FELIX, Friday February 13th 1987 16
S T A T E O F T H E
Last week's FELIX carried an
opinion article written by Dave
Clements on the subject of RCSU, the
constitution and me. This term has
seen several letters and articles
commenting on my lack of respect for
the RCSU constitution but, hopefully,
having first discussed some more
general issues, I can go on to set the
record straight.
In his article Dave stated that
charges within RCSU should be
achieved by "a process of evolution
rather than revolution," and in no
way would I wish to disagree with
him. Back in the autumn I wrote a
long rambling article for FELIX
based entirely on the premise that
RCSU has dismally failed to evolve
over the past ten years, and, as the
article suggested, failure to evolve
eventually leads to extinction. The
simple fact that somebody like
myself, who has had no previous
involvement with RCSU, could be
elected President in a college-wide
ballot emphasises just how
disillusioned students were with their
Union.
If we try to analyse what makes a
Union successful then the single most
important element is breadth of
appeal. If Joe Student can look at the
dozen or so officers of a Union and
identify with one or two of them then
Joe is going to feel that his Union
caters for people like himself. If
during the year Joe's Union holds one
or two events which really appeal to
Joe then he will feel that his Union
partly reflects his own likes and
attitudes. In the past RCSU has been
entirely run by a 'select' group of
individuals with similar attitudes and
similar ideas on how to enjoy
themselves. This led to RSCU being
one of the strongest cliques in College
with a whole range of very subtle
techniques to prevent any form of
deviation from the single well-trodden
path.
I've spent the first six-months of
this year trying my utmost to bring
in as many new faces to the Union as
possible and hopefully, at the same
time I've attempted to change those
rules which hinder or discourage
people from getting involved. In
certain circumstances 1 have indeed

order to get my own way. The
majority of RCS officers presently
disagree with many of my proposals
and if I can get any ideas to succeed
then there must be an element of
validity in my approach.
As I've said, I'm only President for
a short period of time and if things
are going to change then I can't afford
to pussyfoot around. Dave implies
that I personally have got nothing to
lose in my attempts, but that the
Union could suffer irreparably if my
arguments are foolish and naive.
Firstly, I have got a great deal to lose,
and if I were sensible I would just sit
back for twelve months and enjoy the
dinners, the social activities and the
various perks but instead I'm having
a go at trying to do something positive
and if I'm wrong I'm going to suffer
greatly. The students of the Union can
get rid of me in an instant if they feel
that I'm being incompetant but I know
that when I was elected President that
it was on a manifesto which promised
radical changes. Secondly, to say that
I could damage the Union irreparably
is a statement demonstrating the
paranoia of Mr Clements—whatever
wonderous powers I possess CCU
demolition is not one of them.
Dave also suggests that RCSU is
not in the best of health—but then
again I wouldn't expect it to be after
ten years of stagnation. The good
news is that this year every single
aspect of RSCU is stronger than it was
last year—mainly due to an influx of
First Years who have given a
somewhat broader appeal to the
Union simply by being involved. Ents
trips out will have involved over 500
students by the end of the year,
Broadsheet is the best it's been for
years, and even activities such as Jez
and mascotry are enjoying an increase
in support.
Now, back to some particular
points in Dave's article— I'd like to
start by complimenting Dave on his
logical and objective criticism and I'd
also like to thank him for putting his
name to his opinion article—a
somewhat unfashionable thing to do
these days. Firstly, Dave's account of
the Broadsheet episode is totally
inaccurate as the entire process of the
election was as constitutional as it
could possibly have been, and
secondly the lack of an end of term
UGM was due to the illness of the
RCSU Hon Sec and by the time I had
found out about the situation no
suitable rooms were available. To say
that I "purposely denied members of
RCS of their democratic rights" does
somewhat overdramatise the
situation.
So. there we have it, I'm trying to
change things, and I'm not going to
apologise for that, and if the Union
is stronger, healthier and more open
as a result then I can graduate a happy
student.

P.S. To the best of my knowledge
and having scanned through Dave's
article I haven't actually broken the
constitution...Yet!
