Boat Club, February
7th/8th
IC 1st VIII vs Cambridge
University
IC eight race against
Cambridge crew
In bright sunshine and with little wind
to disrupt the water, the Imperial crew
prepared their boat, the Eric Ash, to
battle with the Cambridge Blues in
their very expensive new boat, the
Hell Boat. Boating from the
Cambridge boathouse at Ely,
Saturday's training was to involve two
15 minute races along the Ouse.
With Cambridge in their famous
light blue colours and Imperial in a
newly designed bright blue top, the
two boats were ready. Using a
running start, Cambridge were about
a man up when the race was started
(by the Cambridge coach). Although
Cambridge went ahead early on, a
spirited effort thoughout the race
resulted in a verdict of only 5 lengths
to Cambridge, who had expected an
easy 10 length victory. The second
piece was far tougher, and although
Cambridge again got a length ahead
early on, they were unable to break
the IC crew, who even came back at
Cambridge after about 9 minutes.
With both crews rowing flat out,
rating about 34 for most of the race,
the race could have gone either way,
but, unable to push through the light
blues, Imperial eventually lost by 1 Vi
lengths—a very commendable
performance against such a high
ranking crew.
Sunday's race was the most
exciting. A single 5 minute sprint!
With a superb start, Imperial took a
length off the light blues and held it
for 3 minutes, rating about 37 to their
36. At this point Cambridge gave
everything, and pushed through to
snatch their third victory, but only by
Vi a length. At the end, both crews,
hardly surprisingly, collapsed! An
excellent performance by IC.
Ladies Hockey, Wednesday
4th February
IC 4, Kings 3
Convincing win
IC ladies hockey team were on their
usual brilliant form today and beat
Kings convincingly, despite having
only 10 women and no goalie. IC
suffered a severe blow 5 minutes into
the match, when their dynamic left
wing, Fiona Scott, pulled a muscle
and was forced to leave the field.
Undetered, our star player, Alison
Seward, now playing left inner and
left wing, battled though the Kings'
defence to score the first of a brace
of superb goals.
The game continued, seeing some
hard tackling which led to a second
stoppage due to a stick breakage. IC
now had 10 players and 9 sticks. A
timely cross from Sandra Rofe
brought Alison Seward her second
goal. Sandra Rofe then proceeded to
open her own account with a well
struck ball from a short corner.
Sarah Hodgson dominated both
defence and " thoughout the
match, and alter pu..sing at least 6
players, scored a stylish goal!
IC defence suffered a relapse in the
second half, and Kings scored 3 goals
in ten minutes. However, IC carried
on fighting to win the match.
Filmsoc: Jagged Edge
IC Film Society's next presentation,
this Thursday 19th in Physics LT1
(doors 7.30), is Jagged Edge (18),
starring Jeff Bridges (Thunderbolt and
Lightfoot, Heavens Gate) and Glen
Close.
Close plays a woman defence
lawyer who becomes involved with
client, Bridges, fighting to prove he's
innocent of murdering his wife. To
quote Time Out "the trial scenes are
scripted and played with electrifying
skill." Every turn and twist in the
story is amplified through Close's
emotions. But it is much more than
a court-room picture. These days it
is almost unheard of for a movie to
keep you guessing until the last frame
but this film does, partly because
director Marquand (Return of the
Jedi) plays it so beautifully straight.
Just after its 16mm release, Aliens,
the big box office success of 1986,
has been booked for May 12th by
FilmSoc.
Next Thursday's film is John
Huston's Prizzi's Honour starring
Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner.
50p members £1.00 non-members,
membership available.

Goodwin
Yes, QTSoc have done it again with
an exclusive guest appearance of the
film star Michael Caine. Mr Caine,
at very short notice, has agreed to
drop in on the QT meeting at one
o'clock in Southside Upper Lounge
where he will present a short talk
entitled 'Not a lot of people know
that.' As space is limited, I am afraid
we will have to restrict places to
existing QTSoc members.
Now that our election campaign is
in full swing we are looking for a few
wacky QT's to construct a number of
giant election gimmicks, including a
sandwich board made from real
bread. Turn up on Thursday for
details.
