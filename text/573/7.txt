In m y k i t c h e n I have a n o l d - f a s h i o n e d
apothecary's balance which I use for weighing
flour a n d sugar a n d things. A great big
handsome thing it is, all made of oak with the
•scale pans and moving parts in solid brass.
When I bought it, it had four brass weights
and I found that by putting the right weights on
one or both sides of the scales, I could weigh
any whole number of ounces from one to ten
(and also a few amounts greater than ten).
Typically, the day came when the one ounce
weight slipped into the flour, was baked into a
fruit cake, and came off second best against
granny's dentures. So now I manage without a
one ounce weight. But this isn't much of a
handicap, as I have found that although the
three remaining weights cannot be used to
measure five ounces, I can still use them to
weigh any other whole number of ounces from
one to ten inclusive.
H o w heavy are they?

T H E T A B L E T E N N I S C L U B had its annual
handicap tournaments the last two Wednes-
day afternoons of last term. Though not many
people turned up, due to lack of publicity, a
good time was had by all.
A s h o p e d the majority of games were
u n p r e d i c t a b l e . T h e f i n a l of the S i n g l e s
Tournament was a tense and exciting match
between Chris Nicolaides and Chat Eimsin,
but finally Chris won the final game and won
3-2.
The doubles also was a lively event, with
partners chosen by the draw, table tennis
abilities came second to partner compati-
bility. The final, arranged by the finalists
themselves to be out of three games, was
more to see which team was the steadier with
the team of Andy Tye and Olivatosin Osikoya

Many thanks to Andy Cowling for arranging
the tournaments.

Football Seconds
IC Seconds gained a valuable victory on a
day when the wind and assorted hail showers
c o m b i n e d with a low s u n to make g o o d
football very difficult.
Predictably enough the early part of the
game was slow. During this period, Niccolls,
R i c k a r d a n d Beer all saw their shots go
narrowly wide. It was then that Williams,
playing his first game for the seconds made
an important save as he dived low to his left to
turn a shot wide. Soon after this, IC went
ahead when Rickard flicked the ball across
the penalty area for Niccolls to shoot his half
volley just inside the post.
After half-time, Kings were allowed far too
much of the ball, though rarely encroached
on the IC penalty area. IC always looked
d a n g e r o u s on the break t h o u g h it w a s
certainly not Malcolm Carr's day. He slipped
one shot neatly past the keeper, only, for it to
be blown away from the goal by the wind, and
had another goal disallowed for offside. IC's
second goal came when Saunders was put
clear and blasted his shot inside the near
post. In the closing minutes Kings scored a
consolation goal through it was not enough
to stop IC Second's successful league run.
T E A M : Williams, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,
Griffiths, Lakin, Wiggins, Niccolls, Carr,
Saunders, Rickard.
Football Thirds
IN A T R O C I O U S C O N D I T I O N S on Saturday
the Thirds made a good start to the term.
Healy scored the first goal and a few minutes
later Dhillon made it 2-0
Early in the second half, Flanagan scored
IC's third goal when a back-heel by Healy left
him with only the keeper to beat. Hatton was
unlucky to have a cose range shot save on the
line, but produced further evidence of his
r e t u r n to f o r m by v i c i o u s l y k i c k i n g an
opponent. IC were unlucky to have their lead
reduced when the Hospital was awarded a
controversial penalty, but soon recovered
from this setback and Flanagan scored the
fourth goal from close range. Gilbert in goal
was grateful for a few defensive errors to help
him keep warm. He made some excellent
saves, but was unable to prevent a rebound
from an o p p o n e n t g i v i n g the H o s p i t a l a
second goal. IC sealed up the match when
Sims sent healy clar to slot in IC's fifth.
T E A M : Gilbert, Dunhill, Redmayne, Hatton,
Berns, Dhillon, Archer, Sims, Rimmer,
Flanagan, Healy.
Hockey Thirds
IN A M A T C H played in appalling conditions
IC thirds managed to beat Harlow by the odd
goal.
The conditions and temperature were not
suitable for hockey yet early in the match IC
played good hockey culminating in a goal by
Chris Pound. Hughes was unlucky on several
o c c a s i o n s not to s c o r e (better luck next
S a t u r d a y e v e n i n g Pete!) and o n l y s o m e
diabolical efforts by Harlow prevented further
IC goals.
IC's solid defence of Rampton and Sawers
combined well with new goalkeeper Hopkins
in what was otherwise a cold, dour second
half — with the only highlight being the IC
short corner defence routine of having three
goalkeepers on the goal-line.
T E A M : Hopkins, Rampton, Sawers, Webb,
Hughes, Clift, Mitchell (Capt), Mahers, Wylie,
Taylor, Pound, Woollard.
Swimming
O N W E D N E S D A Y , December 10, Imperial
College met University College in an inter-
college swimming gala. In a close run battle,
IC managed to beat U C 86 points to 77. The
U C women's team were very strong, but IC
pulled the match back with their excellent
relay teams. The IC team was Susan Wilton,
Nicola Hammond, Jane Hiller, Neeran A l -
Sarraf, Katy Woolley, Nick Last, Jim Boucher,
Mike Casey, Rich Leach, John Heffernan,
Barry Ashwin, Bob Bradley, Bill Fahey, and
Chris Garton.
I would like to give a big thank you to Mr
Casey who came all the way from Boreham
Wood to officiate, and also to Cliff Spooner
the pool manager.
