E d i t o r
Sir
I feel prompted to write to you
iO bring to your attention several
observations I have made over
the past term. That publication
o f y o u r s , a r b i t r a r i l y c a l l e d
' F E L I X — T h e Newspaper of
Imperial College U n i o n ' , seems
to h a v e c h a n g e d b e y o n d a l l
recognition.
Let me start by quoting the
Concise Oxford Dictionary, Fifth
E d i t i o n , Page 812: " N E W S -
P A P E R — printed publication,
usually daily or weekly, contain-
ing the news, advertisements and
literary matter."
N o w allow me to apply that to
the F E L I X we see now. Yes, it is
a printed publication, usually
d a i l y or w e e k l y . Y e s , it does
contain advertisements. Yes, I
suppose you could say it contains
literary matter, it depends on
your literary standards I would
think. But the news? N o , not any
news. W e l l , not that you would
recognise as such.
M a y b e your father is R i c h a r d
I n g r a m s (of Private Eye), or
possibly P a u l F o o t (the ' c r u -
sading' journalist of the Daily
Mirror), or maybe both, I don't
k n o w , a n d d o n ' t p a r t i c u l a r l y
care. But it is a bit much to
c o n v e r t t h a t " N e w s p a p e r of
Imperial College U n i o n " into a
cross between Private Eye and
P a u l Foot's column, and that's
what it looks like at the moment.
If it wanted to be a magazine it
w o u l d be called a bloody maga-
zine, not a Newspaper.
Let's take a few random
examples:
1. F E L I X 572
Page 3: 50% of the page (and the
whole front cover) devoted to the
fact that M r M o o n e y wasn't in
the Honours List. Page 5: 50% of
the page taken up by a report on
the R a g Conference, which I still
don't know whether took place
here.
2. F E L I X 569
P a g e s 4 a n d 7: 2 0 % of the
T O T A L space in the issue taken
up with an interview with M r
M o o n e y w h i c h was a l i t t l e
random to say the least.
3. F E L I X 568
Page 1: The whole front page
c o n t a i n i n g a frivolous report
about a Folk C l u b concert. Was
it w e l l a t t e n d e d or not, d i d
anyone work it out from the
report?
Need I go on? I think the
above examples are sufficient to
i l l u s t r a t e the confusion your
sarcastic type of reporting creates
among those very people you are
meant to be informing, namely
those w h o d i d not a t t e n d or
witness the event in question.
By all means have a sarcastic
look at something each week, bui
for God's sake keep it tucked
a w a y inside somewhere, in a
column of its own (e.g. Keith
Waterhouse in the Daily Mirror
on M o n d a y s and Thursdays), so
that we all know that it's tongue
in cheek, and not to be taken
seriously.
By all means campaign for
t h i n g s , but a g a i n give this a
column of its own, and don't go
on so, you do get tiresome (see
your F E L I X Editorial 567). A n d
please try and keep your own
views where they belong, in your
column, the Editorial, not all
over the letters page, the front
paee and the rest. Y o u don't do
yourself justice having to have
the last word in every argument
either. If people slate you in your
own pages, read, note, think and
swallow. If you don't get on with
someone over a particular issue
(e.g. M r Mooney, Dare Afolabi)
then don't turn the affair into a
rival to Dallas, it doesn't impove
your paper at all.
R e p o r t the news s t r a i g h t ,
publish club reports when you
have them (that is the College
news too), have a giggle in one
column, a campaign in another
and a bitch in your own and I
think you'll impove your paper.
Sorry I've gone on so, but tin
above needed to be said, I've
spoken to several people who
agree with one or more of my
observations, and who still don't
know if Bob Pegg was a sellout, so
I think a lot of people in College
are thinking what I've just said. I
wouldn't have said it if I didn't.

Sir
O n e section of the R a g C o n -
ference report i n last week's
F E L I X thoroughly shocked and
appalled me. H o w a person can
m a k e s u c h a n u n t i m e l y a n d
disgustingly bad taste joke over
the recent demise of our late
beloved R a g C h a i r m a n repulses
me.
His motorcycling encounter
w i t h the sheep s h o c k e d a n d
saddened us all. But not it seems
you. Despite his awful deformities
of mind and body, he always
tried to serve us all to the best of
his restricted ability.
Melancholily Yours

Dear Mr Marshall
W e refer to the l e t t e r i n
F E L I X 571 c o n c e r n i n g the
Maths Department, in particular
the P S r e g a r d i n g the p r e -
requisite of a P h D for an aca-
demic career.
W e feel an unbalanced view of
the requirements necessary to
continue higher education has
been given. Indeed, a P h D is
n e i t h e r s u f f i c i e n t n o r e v e n
n e c e s s a r y to g u a r a n t e e a n
academic career. Higher recog-
nition and respect may be gained
by personal achievement alone
i.e. through the production of
quality work.
Tours sincerely
