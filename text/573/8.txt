I a m p l e a s e d to point out that r e m a r k s
attributed to Rae Snee in last week's issue,
concerning M r Mooney, are completely false. I
w i s h t o apologise to M i s s Snee for any
inconvenience and difficulty caused to her by
[as untruthful reference. Anyone knowing
Miss Snee would have realised that such an
u t t e r a n c e is t o t a l l y u n c h a r a c t e r i s t i c of
someone of her maturity.
Mooney
It is interesting to note the Holland Club's
decision to ask College if they can manage
their o w n catering facilities instead of relying
o n t h e s e r v i c e s of the C o l l e g e C a t e r i n g
Service. Prior to this, Guilds Union decided to
hold their Dinner & Dance outside College at
the Royal G a r d e n Hotel. R C S Union have for
many years employed outside caterers for the
Sikvood Ball.
I wonder, is some kind of message filtering
through?
I think not, College Catering Manager, M r
Mooney, is as thick-skinned as his baked
mince-beef rolls. The College catering service
seems oblivious to the views of the students.
The College catering service thrives only on its
monopoly; it does not have to compete for
business, for if it did it would have to improve
or surely fold. Last year, refectory boycotts had
little effect, except to make known the student
feeling. This year, J o h n Passmore plans no
refectory boycotts and has even told me that
h e c o n s i d e r s t h e f o o d t o h a v e d r a m a t i c a l l y
i m p r o v e d s i n c e he has b e e n h e r e . M r
Passmore seems to prefer to clown about as
an ineffectual organ of the Rector's opinion
without regard for the students' views that he
was elected to represent to L o r d Flowers and
the Governing Body.
T h e facts are clean The standard of College
c a t e r i n g is d i s g u s t i n g . M r M o o n e y , as
R e f e c t o r y M a n a g e r , is r e s p o n s i b l e for
"providing the Refectory Service or main-
taining it, subject to economic considerations,
to the satisfaction of the C o l l e g e a u t h o r i t i e s "
(Direct Quote — emphasis mine). I suspect he
performs this task admirably. N o w , it is about
time he started to satisfy the students of
.Imperial College, without w h o m there would
.be n o "College authorities"..
The readers' views are invited, as are M r .
Mooney's, for publication in the letters page.

Reviews
T h e T r a v e l l e r i n the F o r e s t
A film by R o g e r S t o t e s b u r y
Wednesday marked the opening of former
I C U Hon Sec, Roger Stotesbury's latest film.
S h o t o v e r a t w o y e a r p e r i o d it is an
a d v e n t u r o u s a n d i n t e r e s t i n g a t t e m p t at
producing a short length feature with limited
r e s o u r c e s and equipment. The result is
pleasantly surprising.
The film opens with a domestic scene in the
home of the central figure, a nameless man
played by Suki Kalirai. His daily routine begins;
friction at home, a train journey, the crowds
pouring to work over London Bridge and the
office. But this day turns out to be different. He
is dismissed and in his fear and confusion
wanders the streets of L o n d o n , gradually
becoming more aware of the aspects and
potential of his life which were disguised by his
boring existence.
H i s r e a c t i o n is o n e of s o r r o w a n d
bewilderment. In search of change, he travels
out of the city, but still finds that the forest
(symbolically) encloses him. Now, however, he
is not shielded by the ignorance of his previous
mediocrity and he runs in confusion, trying to
find a means of escape.
A s the above description shows, the film is
laced with symbolism to which any number of
different meanings can be attached. The
"hero" wears a blank white mask, which could
be indicative of his uniformity or that he is
masked from the truth of his existence. Either
way it adds to the visual impact of the film,
which is packed with many shots of the sterile
and featureless city. If anything, there is a
succession of cuts which are too rapid, giving a
feeling of frustration at having so little time to
dwell o n the more interesting shots. T h e
p h o t o g r a p h y is generally g o o d , especially
considering that it was all shot with a small
Super-8 camera.
The soundtrack proves to be very unusual,
mainly consisting of radio broadcasts and
noise, which build to a quite frightening climax
at the end of the film.
A s an amateur effort this is certainly a good
attempt and is of particular interest as it was
written a n d filmed by an IC student a n d
includes scenes in and around College. There
are four showings today at 5:30, 7:00, 8:30 and
10:00pm in the Southside Penthouse Dining
Room (Tizard/Falmouth lifts). Tickets are on
sale, price 75p from the Haldane Library or on
the door if available.
Rattle of a
Simple Man
O N C E A G A I N the old firm of Pauline Collins
and John Alderton are in action on the London
stage. Pauline C o l l i n s prefers interpreting
modern playwrights, but the "Rattle" was
written nearly thirty years ago, and it is a play
both have long wished to perform.
Ron is down for the weekend to watch his
favourite team play in London, it is also an
excuse for a night on the town. While he is
somewhat the worse for drink, his extrovert
friend "Guige" dares him to spend the night
with a whore they picked up at a nightclub.
S o the scene is set, the gauche northerner,
s h y , n a i v e , a n d l o n e l y a n d the w h o r e ,
provocative, offhand, attractive. Ron suddenl"
realises what he has done. Going to bed is out
of the question, but the £50 bet! S o the scene
is set for a touching, revealing insight into two
apparently very different people.
After years of working together on T V and
on the stage these two fine actors complement

entertaining night out, although lacking any

Theatre in the Strand.
