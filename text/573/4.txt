Mooney Monopoly Challenged?
A T T H E H o l l a n d C l u b A G M on
W e d n e s d a y , H o l l a n d C l u b
members decided unanimously
to " d i s c u s s w i t h the C o l l e g e
a u t h o r i t i e s the f e a s i b i l i t y of
transferring responsibility for the
H o l l a n d C l u b bar and refectory
to the H o l l a n d C l u b management
committee". T h i s in effect would
be r e v e r t i n g to the s i t u a t i o n
w h i c h e x i s t e d p r i o r to t h e
movement of the H o l l a n d C l u b
to its present location in October
1976, when the H o l l a n d C l u b
was r e s p o n s i b l e for its o w n
affairs. If the H o l l a n d C l u b is
successful in its negotiations, the
Refectory Committee's control of
all catering and bars in College
(the Mooney Monopoly) will be
broken.
H o l l a n d C l u b members have
n e v e r been content w i t h the
prices or the standards of the
College-run catering. They feel
that despite numerous protests,
t h e r e has b e e n l i t t l e o r n o
a t t e m p t b y t h e C o l l e g e to
improve the service offered. Also,
having managed their own affairs
in the past, independent of the
M o o n e y M o n o p o l y , they are
confident that they could offer a
c h e a p e r , better service t h e m -
selves.
Barry Holt, the C h a i r m a n of
the H o l l a n d C l u b Management
Committee, recently raised the
question of independence of the
H o l l a n d C l u b facilities with John
S m i t h , C o l l e g e S e c r e t a r y ( i n -
c i d e n t a l l y , a m e m b e r of the
H o l l a n d Club). M r Smith indic-
ated that if the general member-
ship expressed strong feeling on
the m a t t e r , then the C o l l e g e
would consider any proposals the
Management Committee made.
T h e H o l l a n d C l u b has a
membership of around a thousand
non-academic staff, of which just
over 100 members attended the
A G M o n W e d n e s d a y . T h e i r
policy decision will be discussed
at the next H o l l a n d C l u b M a n -
agement Committee meeting on
M o n d a y .
Prior to their move to the new
facilities adjacent to the Huxley
B u i l d i n g four years ago, the
Holland C l u b had been "home-
less" for about five years. In their
old quarters they had run their
own catering, mostly by volun-
tary labour of workers.
H o l l a n d C l u b officials are
r e l u c t a n t to speculate on the
nature of any alternative catering
a r r a n g e m e n t s t h e y m a y be
considering, as negotiations with
the College into the exact form of
independence from the Mooney
Monopoly arc only beginning.
H o w e v e r , if the C o l l e g e does
agree to let the H o l l a n d C l u b run
t h e i r o w n a f f a i r s a g i n , t h e
p o s s i b i l i t y e x i s t s o f o u t s i d e
catering being contracted in to
the H o l l a n d C l u b . This would at
long last provide some compara-
tive figures o n the efficiency,
pricing and standards of Mooney
food and drink.
Sex
Scandal
A R E T I R E D Ambassador, Sir
Peter H a y m a n , K C M G , C V O ,
M B E , has been "revealed" in
Private Eye as a Paedophile, and a
possessor of pornographic photos,
a r t i c l e s o f f e m a l e c l o t h i n g
i n d i c a t i n g the r e g u l a r enter-
tainment of prostitutes, and 46
q u a r t o d i a r i e s o f 80 p a g e s
cataloging six years of deviant
sexual a c t i v i t y . H e has been
cautioned by the police not to
send obscene material through
the post as he has done. (See
below.)
The Eye suggested that charges
h a d b e e n d r o p p e d , a n d the
matter hushed up as an establish-
ment " f i x " .
What makes this all relevant to
IC is that he is a Governor of the
I n t e r n a t i o n a l S t u d e n t H o u s e
where a number of IC students
reside.
H a y m a n was questioned by
O b s c e n e P u b l i c a t i o n s S q u a d
O f f i c e r s after p o r n o g r a p h i c
literature was left on a bus.
SRC Grants Threatened
University science departments may have their 'quota' places for P h D
student awards reduced or abolished if they fail to achieve an
acceptable standard of P h D completion rates, Sir Geoffrey Allen,
C h a i r m a n of the Science Research C o u n c i l said on Tuesday.
A recent study by the C o u n c i l showed that about 60% of C o u n c i l -
funded students completed their P h D s within four years, but Sir
Geoffrey would prefer this figure to be 90%. H e suggested that new
awards would be made to departments only if its previous students had
finished their work quickly enough.
T h e S R C has drawn up a list of institutions ranged in order to P h D
completion rates of S R C funded students. B i r m i n g h a m comes top of
the list, but Imperial College is surprisingly thirty-first out of thirty-
five, being following only by Exeter, the Polytechnics, Sussex and
Bradford.
A working party of the Government's Advisory Board for the
Research C o u n c i l describes the discrepancy between institutions as
startling and says there is no obvious explanation. It has to be assumed
that it represents a difference in the ethos of institutions, it says.
" I f this is so then to reform what is wrong one needs to twist the arms
of the institutions rather than those of the students," it adds.
M e a n w h i l e , the Board of Studies has noted that a "significant
p r o p o r t i o n of research students h a d not s u b m i t t e d for their
degree/diploma some four years after commencing their research."
This may be due to the difficulty or obscurity of the subject matter in
I C P h D subjects.
A questionnaire has been circulated to registered P h D students
regarding the length of time it is taking for completion of their work.
Students who have completed their research and are currently engaged
in " w r i t i n g u p " have not been circulated as their names are not on the
alphabetical list of students. It is important that these students should
contact J o h n Passmore at the I C U Office to be included in the survey.
Stop Press
Y E S T E R D A Y , Shirley Williams
spoke at I m p e r i a l College. The
subject of her talk was the Report of
the Independent Commission on
International Development Issues
under the Chairmanship of Willy
Brandt. The report is available at the
IC Bookshop priced £1.95.
Ms Williams told F E L I X that she
hoped that we have a group at IC,
who are interested in the Brandt
Report. " A real effort is needed.
Imperial is a singularly appropriate
place to do something. Wc need a
new concept of engineering. Wc
cannot simply pick up technology
and apply it to the Third World
without doing immense harm," she
said.
Y e s t e r d a y ' s talk by S h i r l e y
Williams was the first of series of four
Department of Humanities events
discussing the Brandt Report. Ms
Williams gave the viewpoint of the
North. Next Thursday the High
Commissioner for Tanzania will
discuss the South's views of the
Report.
Pipe Dream
T H E P H O T O G R A P H I C Society's Black and White competition was
held last Tuesday. O v e r two dozen prints were scrutinised by a
professional judge. It was an open competition and the subjects included
candid portraits, landscapes, photojournalism and still life.
T h e photos were displayed and each print was discussed by the judge.
His advice varied from hints on how to improve picture composition,
making the most of available lighting and how to select the area of the
photo to be used for the final print. The judge highly commended
several prints and commented that members of the society had obviously
put in a lot of effort.
Tension mounted as the judge whittled the entries down to the final
four. W h o would w i n the £5 first prize, the second prize of a roll of slide
film and the third £2? The judge awarded the first prize to F E L I X
photographer, C o l i n Palmer D o C III, whose winning entry was a still
life, 'Apple pipe.'
The judge explained that he chose the winning print because of its
impact. H e commented that it was a technically difficult print because
agitated masking methods were used in the final printing. The winner of
the second prize entered a portrait of a child sucking its thumb and the
same photographer came 3rd with a portrait of a couple in a classic pose.
(If the runner up ( N Hashem) or other entrants would like their prints
to be considered for publication in The Phoenix or possibly in next
week's F E L I X then please drop your prints into the F E L I X Office).

Colin Palmer
T h e w i n n i n g photo (see above) was created as part of a portfolio
which will be published in this year's I C U literary magazine, The
Phoenix. The magazine will be on sale towards the end of this term.
F E L I X asked Colin Palmer to comment on his winning entry, " I
enjoy creating surrealistic images of everyday objects. M y subjects are
usually constructed out of fruit and kitchen bric-a-brac. I a i m to choose,
materials that have a symbolic aura as well as texture. The composite
structure cries out to be photographed."
