ISLAM
1. Anchor of Belief
Knowing God is the lever upon
w h i c h the whole of I S L A M is
pivoted, without it every action in
Islam or for it loses its real value, as
it becomes an action without its aim,
and what use is such an action?
But, how do we get to know God,
and what is the way to this know-
ledge? The answer to this question is
vital and necessary, for failing to find
the way will block the aim we seek.
Many people, past and present,
have denied God's existence because
they could not feel him with their
senses; thinking that such was theway
to God. They called the believers as
unscientific, unimaginative, misled
perturbed, as well as many others in
a long list of names of mockery,
because they believed in a way other
than the senses.
2. Gravity and Neutrons
The physical reality of such people
clearly shows the falsehood of their
accusations. They believe in gravity
and its laws even though they did
not see it; but only saw its effects.
They believe in the mind and they
have not seen it either, the same
goes for magnetism, the electrons,
neutrons, etc. Thus they actually
believe in many things their senses
could not detect; but the effects and
consequences lead them to these
beliefs, without any doubts.
3. The Mind, The Senses and
Deception
thus it was the mind and not the
senses that lead them to these
beliefs, even though they have used
their senses as a tool to collect data
and information. But without the
mind, there would have been no
conclusion and hence belief. In
actual fact, our senses may deceive
us in many ways, and the truth is
disentangled using the mind alone.
For example: a stick half immersed
in water looks as though it is broken;
white numbers appear larger than
black numbers of the same size, we
always feel our heads at the upper
position whilst walking although we
may be at the south pole or the
north pole. Thus it is clear that the
mind is the key to correct perception
a n d without it, our senses can
deceive us, and our knowledge
would have been non-existant. (?)-
4. Straight and CrookedThinking
Going back to the original question;
were these people right in confining
knowledge to the senses? Were they
rational and objective when they
refused belief in God because they
could not detect him with their
senses; even though they have
accepted many other facts they
c o u l d not s e n s e , facts w h i c h
c o n s t i t u t e s o m e of the major
discoveries man has ever made.
Thus, this is one of the major
paths of crooked thinking through
out the ages, w h i c h served to
alienate many people from the
correct belief, even though it is
obviously wrong. And even in this
day and age we have heard about
many who do not believe just
because they cannot see God, even
nations have made such declarations,
I cite the example of the Soviet
Union after sending the first satellite
into space.
The existence of this fallacy is as
old as atheism is. It is a symptom of
the illness of the soul and the heart,
and not a consequence of clear
thinking or a just attitude.
5. The Quran
In many instances in the Quran, it is
explained how many have insisted
on sensing God through their sight
or hearing showing the illnesses
leading to such claims. The Quran
specifies the reasons as: ignorance,
arrogance, perversion and injustice.
Regarding ignorance: " T h o s e
without knowledge say 'Why doesn't
God speak to us? Or why a sign
does not come?' So, the people
before them have said" — We notice
how the verse referred to the words
of the ignorant rather than the
knowledgeable and shows that the
road to G o d lies in his effects.
Regarding arrogance: "Such as
fear not the meeting with Us (for
judgement) say, 'Why are not the
angels sent down to us or why do we
not see our Lord?' Indeed they have
an arrogant conceit of themselves,
and mightly is the insolence of their
impiety". The day they see the
angels, no joy will there be to the
sinners that day. Thus here they
want to see, but who do they want to
see? They imagine that the present
life is all there is to it, and nothing is
beyond it. The verses have shown
that there will be a world different
from this one where they can
perceive, but in this life they cannot,
and G o d is surely more difficult to
perceive than the angels!
C o n c e r n i n g perversion: " T h e
Pharoh said, ' 0 Haamaan, build me
a lofy palace that I may attain the
ways and means — the ways and
means of reaching the heavens, and
that I may mount up to the God of
Moses, but as far as I am concerned,
I think Moses is a liar! This was
made alluring in Pharoh's eye i.e. the
evil of his deeds, and he was
hindered from the path."
Thus the Pharaoh followed the
wrong path and was perverted.
The last of the reasons is injustice:
"they said — i.e. the Jews — 'Show
us God in public', but they were
dazed for their presumption" (or
injustice).
T h u s they have a c c u s e d the
believers of imagination, lying, and
emotionalism and today we see a
continuation of this trend.
The Way to God, Its Signs
T h e r e f o r e , the way mentioned
earlier will lead us astray in the
subject of finding about the nature of
G o d . T h e way to G o d lies in
analysing his effects, and therefore
leads to him; and it is the only way —
the mind, thought and knowledge
being essential preconditions.
Thus without the mind the signs
cannot be analysed; and without
thought its creator cannot be found,
and without knowledge neither
cannot be done. This may seem
strange to such people as atheists,
for they always call themselves
secular, thoughtful, free, etc. But, a
statement without proof has no
value.
In Chapter — A l Shoora — God
s a y s : " B u t those who d i s p u t e
concerning God after he has been
accepted — futile is their dispute in
the sight of their Lord". Verse 16
Thus, for the time being, we will
start the Quran. Whoever bothers
to glance through it will notice how
clearly the Quran sets the arguments
for the mind, the thought, and the
effects of Allah. In chapter — Al Ah
kaf — God says: " Say: 'Do you see
what it is you invoke besides God?
S h o w me what it is they have
created on earth, or have they a
share in the heavens? Bring me a
book — revealed — before this, or
any remnant of knowledge you may
have if you are telling the truth!'".
Verse 4
That is, is there an atom of
knowledge verifying anyone else
than God as the creator. Thus if
people denied their Lord, it does not
form a proof of knowledge but
demonstrates ignorance. In Chapter
— Al Hajj — God says, "Yet there is
among men such a one that disputes
about G o d , without knowledge,
without guidance, and without a
book of enlightenment". Verse 8
Unlike complete ignorance, void
of any knowledge, this is a special
type which G o d mentioned in
Chapter — Al Room — by saying,
"They know but the outer things in
the life of this world; but of the End
of things they are heedless". Verse
7, and also says, "Therefore shun
those who turn away from our
message and desire nothing but the
life of this world. That is as far as
k n o w l e d g e will r e a c h t h e m " .
Chapter Najm Verse 29/30
It is purposely stressed to mention
knowledge, thought and the mind in
the Quran very frequently: "there
are signs for those who understand"
Chapter Ra'ad Verse 4. "Verily is
this a sign for people of knowledge"
Chapter An Naml, Verse 52. "Verily
in this is a sign for those who give
thought", Chapter Nahl, Verse 11.
"In that are signs for those who
hearken", Chapter — Ar Room —
Verse 22. "Say: 'Behold all that is in
the heavens and on earth'", Chapter
Yoonus, Verse 101.
Thus whoever enquires through
the Quran realises that Islam assigns
the Muslim the duty of thinking, and
learning; and that knowledge and
thought are part of the Muslim's
personality. This is contrasted ot the
non-Muslim as a desire to amuse
himself with, or as a profession to
earn a living, or as a hobby to some
individuals. Thus the reason for
s h o u l d e r i n g the M u s l i m s with
knowledge is that it leads them to
Islam as the truth, "And those to
whom knowledge has come see that
the revelation sent down to you
from your Lord — that is the truth",
Chapter Sabaa, Verse 6.
Thus we shall see that it was not
the lack of signs or the vagueness in
their presentation that lead many to
atheism. In fact the signs are
countless, and with such clarity that
they become impossible to conceal.
The secret lies within the human
being himself. The secret is how he
manages to avoid the signs, how he
becomes too arrogant to accept the
truth, in avoiding the t r u t h , in
perverting from the human norms
and manners and ending as a closed
shell unable to perceive even when
confronted by miracles.
The Quran informs us about such
people saying, "Even if we opened
out to them a gate from heaven, and
they were to continue all day
ascending therein; they would only
say: 'Our eyes have been intoxica-
ted, nay we have been bewitched by
sorcery", Chapter Hijr, Verse 14/15.
"But if they see a sign, they turn
away and say: "This is but transient
magic", Chapter Qamar, Verse 2.
"And how many signs in the heavens
and the earth do they pass by? Yet
they turn away from them!", Chapter
Yusut, Verse 105.
