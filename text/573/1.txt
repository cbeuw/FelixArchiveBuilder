O N T U E S D A V evening in
Stan's Bar, Dave Gayer, the
president of Guilds, was
heard to exclainv'Td shave
my head for £200 to Rag".
When asked to put this in
writing, he increased the
amout to £250 and then
signed a statement(left).
If the £250 is collected by
January 25th, Dave will
have his head shaved at the
Guilds Bar Games night in
the Union Bar.
Dave is perfectly serious; if enough money is not collected by
the specified time all the donations will be refunded.
Already, over £45 has been collected by asking around but we
at FELIX are confident that what Dave really needs is widespread
publicity.
Badges bearing the inscription "I Gave to Shave Dave" will be
available to contributors of £1 or more.
To make a donation, see Andy Dixon in the Guilds Office.
G r o w i n g dissatisfaction with M r Marshall's editorial style reached a
peak towards the end of last term when a U G M motion denouncing his
unjustifiable attacks on certain groups of students was passed.
In the first issue of this term, however, M r Marshall launched a
completely unreasonable onslaught against V i c t o r Mooney, Refectory
Manager, against the College catering system and against Miss Rachel
Snee, I C U Deputy President.
The article started with a banner headline " M o o n e y shocked 'I went
rigid when I heard the news'", giving the impression that M r M o o n e y
had made that remark, one would have to read to the bottom o f the
page to see that remark attributed to M r Marshall.
The article continued by suggesting that M r Mooney had been
expecting a knighthood and that he was disappointed not to recieve
one. It went on by suggesting that M r Mooney had "stored up the best
food for outside visitors" implying that only by underhand methods
was M r Mooney capable of being congratulated as a superb caterer.
The article then quoted, totally out of context, a comment made last
term in F E L I X by M r Mooney suggesting he was expecting an award,
b e f o r e s t a t i n g t h a t s t u d e n t s w e r e " e m a c i a t e d , s i c k a n d
undernourished" and "suffering" from eating at I C . This statement is
widely regarded as true, if a little overstated. T h e report then put
lorward the idea that profits from the refectories should go to the funds
of a major political party.
F E L I X then moved into Spanish, asking M r Mooney if he " h a d
much food poisoning lately?" and the staff " w h y don't y o u try
employing a chef instead o f a washer-up to d o the cooking?" to be
answered by " W h y don't you spit over somebody else?" These are
fabrications.
The report went on to present a partly false picture of M r Mooney's
catering ability, mainly that his career had started on the M i l e E n d
R o a d and that he had won an award for his catering. T o the best of
available knowledge, both these suggestions arc false. Next, it was
alleged that IC's catering has disintegrated into a disgusting state
since M r Mooney came here, and that he was a buffoon. Whilst M r
Mooney is not a buffoon, the previous allegation cannot be so easily
dismissed.
T h e article went on to say that College kitchens broke large parts of
a Public Health Act, before setting off on a vicious condemnation of the
way outside customers are treated.
The reference to Buckingham Palace is utterly without substance. In
the last paragraph, it was suggested that Miss Snee had bribed
College lor her exam passes and attributed to her a statement which
she did not make, and wishes to be disassociated from.
Hence the story only raised one valid point, that the catering service
does turn out good food, when specially ordered, usually for people
outside C o l l e g e , w h i l s t it m a d e d e f a m a t o r y a l l e g a t i o n s a b o u t
prominent people.
Due to F E L I X not appearing until Friday afternoon, there was
limited reaction last week.
This M o n d a y , however, disdain started to pour in to the I C U n i o n
Office, as a reply to the torrent of criticism M r M a r s h a l l unleashed.
Towards the end of the afternoon, M r Passmore visited the F E L I X
Office to speak to M r Marshall. H e said that both the Rector, L o r d
Flowers, and the C h a i r m a n of the Refectory Committee, D r Schroter,
had objected to the previous week's issue. M r Passmore also said that he
would bring the matter up at the evening's I C U Publications Board
Meeting. Continued on page three.
