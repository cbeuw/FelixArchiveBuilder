At the meeting, the earlier part of the agenda was swiftly dealt with,
so as to fully consider the F E L I X situation.
L i z Lindsey said that the Executive disapproved of F E L I X being
used as a slanging organ. They thought it did not represent the views of
the whole U n i o n . Others at the meeting suggested that the article had
gone beyond a joke and asked for a reason for the article, to be told by
M r Marshall that it was entertainment. W h e n M r M a r s h a l l was asked
why he misquoted R a e Snee in that manner, he said that he thought
that the entire article was written in such a style that even a dimwit
would realise that she had not said that. W h e n asked to justify the
personal attack on M r Mooney, M r M a r s h a l l said he did not wish to
do so then, but later in term through F E L I X .
Other matters raised included whether any feedback had been
received from other students (none had); whether P u b Board was
responsible for F E L I X ; if the newspaper should represent the views of
the student body or L o r d Flowers; and whether any change would occur
in M r Marshall's editorial style as a result of the complaints made,
which was thought unlikely. The Board decided that (i) it does not
agree with the vindictive nature of many articles in F E L I X and asked
M r Marshall to take the views of P u b Board into account in future, (ii)
he should apologise both publicly and privately to M r Mooney, and
(iii) he should not print any further personal attacks on M r Mooney.
These decisions were passed 4-1, 5-0, 2-0, from eleven voting members
present. J o n Firth, C h a i r m a n , expressed the Board's dissatisfaction
with M r Marshall's article.
M r Firth told F E L I X later that he did not expect M r Marshall to
take any notice of the criticisms made, but he was glad the matter had
been discussed to such an extent.
O n Tuesday, J o h n Passmore returned to the F E L I X Office to tell
M r Marshall that he had seen the Rector who said that F E L I X last
week was disgusting, as it had been throughout the year. M r Passmore
asked M r Marshall, once again, to apologise privately and on the front
page of F E L I X , otherwise he would initiate disciplinary action against
him at U n i o n Council, or elsewhere. This might involve one or any
combination of:
a) A reprimand
b) Temporary withdrawal of privilege
c) Temporary/permanent suspension from some or all of U n i o n
facilities and amenities
d) A fine not exceding the cost of replacing any damaged property
or equipment
e) A fine not exceeding £10, to be donated to the U n i o n charity of
the current year.
These punishments can only be imposed by the Executive and not
by Council, however there is provision for an appeal to a Committee of
five persons and a non-voting chairman, all randomly chosen by
Council.
If the Executive Committee wish to remove the F E L I X Editor from
office, he would be deemed dismissed, and have all his responsiblities
and privileges accorded to h i m as Editor removed if, and only if, his
dismissal is approved by a two-thirds majority at two G e n e r a l
Meetings held not less than twenty-eight College days, but not more
than forty College days, apart.
Assuming he was dismissed, the Honorary Secretary, L i z Lindsey, it
seems likely, would take over as newspaper Editor, ensuring the
production of the newspaper and the day to day running of the litho
printing facilities as well as her own job.
T h e next move in this matter may well be at the U n i o n C o u n c i l
meeting on M o n d a y , J a n u a r y 19, but it seems unlikely that the opinion
of the whole student body will be canvassed fully for some time.
Bookshop takeover
T H E I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E
Bookshop has a new manager,
M r R o y Hicks, who took up his
appointment last week. H e told'
F E L I X that amongst his future
plans were to invite publishers to
present e x h i b i t i o n s , a p p r o x i -
m a t e l y once a m o n t h , w h i c h
would not just contain academic
books. H e intends to have books
on non-academic College activi-
ties, such as the series of forth-
c o m i n g tk»ks on the B r a n d t
Commission's Report. H e wishes
to publicise the Bookshop more,
by having more signs put up, by
a noticeboard in the Shop, and in
F E L I X by giving a list of popular
books throughout the country,
more book reviews and notice of
any special offers available to
customers. H e hopes to cooperate
m o r e w i l l l o c a l l i b r a r i e s a n d
colleges, to ensure a better service
for s t u d e n t s a n d f u l l use o f
facilities.
UGM Farce
Barney McCabe a goat
THE FIRST UGM of the term was held In the unfamiliar
surroundings of Mech Eng 220, last Thursday lunchtlme.
The meeting opened to less than 150 people with the Exec
complaining about their hard seats. John Passmore, ICU
President, took the chair In the absence of Jon Firth, who had
sent his apologies.
M r Passmore was jokingly objected to as C h a i r m a n on the grounds
that he was "not qualified". However, the meeting rapidly accepted
the minutes of the last meeting and heard the President's business, for
which Rae Snee took the chair. A m i d continuous heckling, M r
Passmore told the U G M about the Governing Body meeting and the
decision to continue with the Nuclear Fuel Technology course. H e said
that the Rector had agreed to meet a small number of interested
students to discuss the course, and people are asked to contact the
President by today (January 16). O n Residence, M r Passmore said that
from next year everyone who wishes will receive one year in H a l l .
Referring to W U S , he said it was ironic that most of its grant came
from the Government. L i z Lindsey announced that the I N C O S T
Conference was now definitely going on and nearly sixty delegates
were coming. Rae Snee, the D P , w h has just recovered from an illnes,
said that ' M i k e ' , the I C mascot, was heavily guarded owing to
telephone calls enquiring about it, which led them to think it might be
"violated" soon.
She continued by saying that the loose furniture had arrived for
Stan's and added that another beer promotion night would be held
soon — the J o h n Bull having been successful. A l l three reports were
accepted, L i z Lindsey, as returning officer, asked the meeting to ratify
Barney M c C a b e as P W P ordinary member. The meeting said " N o " .
The President asked " W h y not?" and was told "Because he's a goat".
After more muttering and joking at M r M c C a b e ' s expense, he was
grudgingly accepted.
R i c h Archer announced the R C S U E n d of T h e W o r l d Party, to
mark the beginning of Reagan's Presidency, on J a n u a r y 20, and Dave
Gayer announced the Guilds Dinner and Dance (tickets from the
Guilds U n i o n Office) and mentioned that they would have cheap rates
for Dinner Suits and overnight accommodation at the Hotel.
W h e n the meeting moved on to consider motions, M r Passmore said
that three of the four had been withdrawn. M a t t h e w H u n t b a c h offered
to propose the Student Loans motion. The motion on Bicycles was
called, but no one at the meeting wished to propose it, the original
sponsors not having turned up.
However, the motion was tokenly proposed, tokenly objected to, " I
oppose this motion, I think I've said enough," and the debate tokenly
summed up, " I f we're going to be silly, we may as well pass i t , " before
the motion was accepted on the vote.
As M a t t h e w H u n t b a c h rose to speak on the Student Loans motion, a
procedural motion was moved, that the question be not put, because
the U n i o n did not presently know enough on the subject. This was
accepted on the vote.
The meeting then discussed other business, O w e n Greene asking
those present not to forget about the Nuclear A r m s C a m p a i g n . D u r i n g
this, the S T O I C film crew arrived at 1:25pm. The President said he
expected the motion on Multilateral Disarmament to be considered at
the next U G M . The meeting closed at 1:30pm with less than 200
people present throughout.
M r Passmore told F E L I X later that he thought the low turnout was
due mainly to exams at this time. He said he was annoyed at those who
put forward motions and then withdrew them.
Patrick Coll
Shack Shock
IC H A M S O C members returned
for the term to find that their
transmitting shack, on the top of
the U n i o n Building, had been
removed. T h e Estates depart-
ment " p u l l e d it down to repair
the roof," and Rae Snee told last
week's U G M that it might cost
the U n i o n as much as £1,500 to
replace.
Phones
hooked up
L A S T W E E K the phone system
in the Southside HallsofResidence
were eventually connected to the
i n t e r n a l p h o n e s y s t e m . S u b -
scribers may now dial from the
internal system to a Southside
landing, or in the other direction,
by prefixing the required number
with a zero. Residents will now
be a b l e to c o n t a c t I C R a d i o
directly from their landings.
