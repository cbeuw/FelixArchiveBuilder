With World AIDS D a y happening this
Wednesday, I felt the need to write
about sexual health in general as part
of the I C U Sexual Health Week.
HIV/AIDS
World AIDS D a y is a way of cre-
ating a n d nurturing awareness a n d
fundraising for research, trying to
improve palliative treatments a n d
perhaps find a cure / effective v a c -
cine. To a d d to this, those with a g l o b -
al consciousness will note that 2 8 mil-
lion of the World total 3 3 . 5 million
cases of HIV infection are found with-
in the Developing W o r l d . Research
funding is needed to ensure such
medicines are simple, c h e a p a n d
readily available.
As a n aside, I w o u l d r e c o m m e n d
regular tests, whether you consider
yourself high risk o r not. These are
usually free from most Genito-Urinary
Medicine ( G U M ) Clinics. Loads o f
information is available o n the w e b ,
including lists of clinics o n
www.aidsmap.com - a site co-pro-
duced by the National AIDS M a n u a l
and the British HIV Association. O t h -
ers to look out for are the Terence
Higgins Trust (www.tht.org.uk), C r u -
sAID (www.crusiad.org.uk), National
AIDS Trust (www.nat.org.uk) a n d the
various H E A sites (covered in
www.hea.org.uk).

W h y s o c y n i c a l ? Perhaps I just
get the f e e l i n g , h a v i n g met t h e m ,
that they w e r e d o i n g just fine until
a n e w b i g b r o t h e r c a m e a l o n g .

necessary.
In trouble with College?
Thus f a r this term I have h a d
s o m e juicy c a s e w o r k . . . . s o r r y a l l
confidential. Still I think it is i m p o r -
tant to r e m i n d everyone that if y o u
lan d yourself in the p o o h with C o l -
lege, be that to d o with your course
As part of this week's I C U Sexual
Health Awareness W e e k , the U n i o n
a n d Imperial Q u e e r s (our Lesbian,
G a y a n d Bisexual Society) will be run-
ning a stall in the U n i o n Lobby with
information, leaflets a n d c o n d o m s .
W e will b e "selling" red ribbons all
week for a donation. This week will
be run in co-ordination with the other
campuses. I C S M S U has arranged
for Dr James Deutsch (from CrusAID)
to c o m e a n d speak o n living with HIV
o n Tuesday lunchtime (venue to be
announced). I Q is also running a
safer sex workshop in the U n i o n o n
Tuesday night.
Sexually Transmitted Infections
The practice of safe sex is a g o o d
thing to encourage because it helps
in preventing the transmission of
other STIs. The likes of syphilis, g o n -
orrhea, chlamydia a n d thrush are still
" p o p u l a r " a n d d o the rounds every
year. O f course, for heterosexuals the
biggest worry of unsafe sex should
surely b e pregnancy. A h , but I hear
you cry that the girl should b e p r o -
tecting herself, chances are they a r e
on the Pill. Assumptions are b a d
things to m a k e a n d usually blind
acceptance of them results in future
problems. Follow the motto " B e Pre-
o r hall o r whatever, then y o u c a n
c h o o s e s o m e o n e f r o m the U n i o n t o
c o m e a l o n g t o represent y o u . T h e
value of having us a l o n g is that w e
have seen cases before, w e are not

point out that they shouldn't be ask-
ing w h a t they are trying t o ask. Y o u

Preparation a n d care will not stop
even/thing (pubic lice o r genital warts
for example) a n d everyone should
remember that the U n i o n provides,
free, unbiased, friendly advice. It you
think you have contracted a n STI a n d
are unsure where to g o from there,
p o p in to see either Martin T h o m s o n
or myself. W e have lists of the local
G U M Clinics w h o offer treatment,
advice a n d sometimes counselling,
often a n o n y m o u s l y . T h e Student
H a n d b o o k also has addresses a n d
telephones numbers, o r look in the
phone b o o k under "clinics". If y o u
are particularly w o r r i e d , regular
checks are available, including a full
screen. This c a n b e provided in par-
allel with a n HIV test. A g a i n check out
the yellow pages o r the listings o n
www.aidsmap.com. To a i d aware-
ness, this week's B a r Trivia in d a
Vinci's will be a STI / HIV quiz. Usual
prizes (courtesy of STA Travel) a n d a
particularly interesting picture round!
Please attend - it is free a n d
should be a fun a n d exciting evening.
Winners should be proud that they
are aware a n d fully loaded with all
the k n o w l e d g e to stay safe a n d
healthy a n d not be taken as any indi-
cation of their past!

Cancer
O o h , the d r e a d e d C word. With
IC being predominately male a n d
a r o u n d the 1 8-25 year old section,
we have a prime p o o l of m e n a n d a
prime target g r o u p for testicular c a n -
cer. M a y b e it's a t a b o o area o r per-
haps it's just ignorance, but this is still
a significant killer of men. It is a rela-
tively simple procedure to " b e aware
of yourselves". For example, after a
w a r m bath, just roll each testicle
between your thumb a n d forefinger.
Feel all the w a y around for any
unusual lumps o r any tender area. If
you b e c o m e worried, see your G R
Fairly easy to treat, o r if things have
progressed then prosthetic testes are
available a n d you c a n operate quite
normally o n just the o n e . M u c h better
than not d o i n g anything which could
risk your life. Similarly, f o r w o m e n ,
being aware of your breasts is a fair-
ly simple procedure a n d should be
d o n e fairly regularly. A g a i n , if you feel
any unusual lumps o r tenderness you
should a p p r o a c h your doctor. The
other significant cancer for w o m e n to
be aware of is cervical cancer. D o c -
tors r e c o m m e n d regular smear tests
from the a g e of twenty.
C a n c e r should b e treated as
something that c a n potentially hit
everybody rather than the older g e n -
eration. Please be aware.
