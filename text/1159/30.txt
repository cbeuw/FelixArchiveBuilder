Fancy g o i n g a b r o a d with little
m o r e than £ 4 0 0 in y o u r p o c k e t ?
S o u n d s t o o g o o d t o b e true?
W e l l that's exactly w h a t I d i d
this summer. I went t o the U S o f A ;
my flights a n d m y first nights
a c c o m m o d a t i o n in N e w York were
p a i d for, a n d I h a d the s u m m e r o f
my life. I a c h i e v e d this feat by
b o o k i n g myself o n a B U N A C s u m -
mer c a m p p r o g r a m m e . B U N A C , in
case you've never h e a r d o f t h e m ,
a r r a n g e w o r k i n g holidays f o r stu-
dents a n d y o u n g p e o p l e t o p l a c e s
like A m e r i c a , C a n a d a , A u s t r a l i a ,
N e w Z e a l a n d , South A f r i c a a n d a
selection o f d e v e l o p i n g countries.
You c a n either c h o o s e t o find a j o b
in o n e of these p l a c e s , o r work o n
o n e o f t h e s u m m e r c a m p s in
A m e r i c a - B U N A C simply p r o v i d e
the opportunity f o r y o u to g o , by
o r g a n i s i n g your w o r k i n g visa as
well as h e l p i n g y o u t o g e t o u t
there. I t h o u g h t a s u m m e r spent in
a f o r e i g n country a c t i n g in a c o u n -
sellor role with kids w o u l d b e a
g o o d i d e a , s o I d e c i d e d t o
b e c o m e a special needs c o u n s e l -
lor o n a s u m m e r c a m p in N e w
York.
After a n i n f o r m a l interview I
h a d t o wait f o r w h a t s e e m like
ages to find o u t if I h a d g o t a p l a c e
at c a m p . Eventually I f o u n d o u t
that I w a s successful a n d w h e r e I
w o u l d b e g o i n g . T h e f e e l i n g o f
e l a t i o n that I e x p e r i e n c e d w a s
s o o n f o l l o w e d by t r e p i d a t i o n , a s I
realised exactly w h a t I h a d s i g n e d
myself up f o r - ie up t o three a n d a
half months in a f o r e i g n country
with p e o p l e I h a d never met. O n c e
I h a d g o t t o the airport, however,
a n d m e t other p e o p l e g o i n g t o
c a m p , those feelings quickly s u b -
sided. O n the p l a n e everyone w a s
chatting, a s k i n g p e o p l e w h e r e they
were g o i n g a n d w h a t they were
d o i n g , a n d i m b i b i n g large q u a n t i -
ties of free a l c o h o l . After s t a g g e r -
ing t h r o u g h p a s s p o r t c o n t r o l , pil-
ing o n t o the ' B U N A C bus' t o t h e
free a c c o m m o d a t i o n they h a d p r o -
vided in N e w York, w e a l l spent a
night e x p l o r i n g o n e o f the most
vibrant cities in the w o r l d .
After a g o o d d a y in N e w York
it w a s off to c a m p with o n e o f the
c o u n s e l l o r s t o b e w o r k i n g o n the
c a m p with m e . I arrived t o find that
I w a s t o s p e n d m y time l o o k i n g
after t h e t e e n a g e boys. A t t h e
b e g i n n i n g o f c a m p I t o o k the kids
a r o u n d t o a l l o f the activities. T h e
funniest thing I r e m e m b e r saying,
to m y t e e n a g e boys, w a s "right
guys, its time f o r sewing". T h e work
was really c h a l l e n g i n g , as I h a d t o
m a k e sure all the kids were receiv-
ing e n o u g h attention, all the time,
but it w a s a l s o very rewarding
especially w h e n t h e kids w o u l d
thank y o u o r s a y "Matt I'm s o
happy". O f c o u r s e , there were rare
times w h e n y o u wished t h e kids
weren't t h e r e , b u t these rare
m o m e n t s were o u t w e i g h e d by the
g o o d times. T h e A m e r i c a n kids
didn't turn o u t to b e as bratty as
the o n e s portrayed in A m e r i c a n sit-
c o m s a n d I m a n a g e d to establish
a really g o o d relationship with a l l
of t h e m .
After t w o months at c a m p , I
couldn't wait t o g o travelling. A
friend a n d I d e c i d e d to g o a r o u n d
the East C o a s t by train. In t w o
weeks of travel w e m a n a g e d to
enjoy t h e delights of N e w York,
visit Bill Clinton's house in W a s h -
ington D C , visit N e w O r l e a n s , say
hello t o Elvis in M e m p h i s a n d then
g o whitewater rafting in Pittsburgh,
before returning just slightly tired
to N e w York.
All in a l l , I have never h a d
such a g o o d s u m m e r a n d met s o
m a n y different a n d interesting
p e o p l e . If y o u w a n t to d o the same
it is incredibly easy to d o , s o don't
wait! C o n t a c t Katie Smith o r m e
for m o r e info; if y o u w a n t to g o
y o u won't regret your d e c i s i o n . S o
m a n y p e o p l e nearly g o , but never
motivate themselves e n o u g h to get
there.
