Biannual report time Women finish top
Kendo Volleyball
Its been six months since we
reported to you on our glorious
victory at the University Champi-
onships. Well, we're back. Satur-
day 20th November saw the 26th
International Kendo Clubs Cham-
pionship. As the name suggests, it
is one of the most prestigious
kendo competitions in Europe,
with over 60 teams entering from
around the world. It was even
more special for the ICU Kendo
Club, as it was only the second
match in the relatively young histo-
ry of the team. So there we were,
the whole lot of us to support the
two players who represented our
team: Koichiro and Tak. Despite
the general lack of sleep among
all members, our team made a
promising start and won the first
two matches, but eventually we lost
to the championship winners (final
score 2-3). Our guys put up a real
fight, for which they were credited
with comments that their match
was just as, in not more, entertain-
ing than the final! A special round
of applause goes to Tak, who no
doubt was the least experienced
player in the championship
(Remember, we've only been train-
ing for about 5 months) but
showed one of the best fighting
spirits and a great potential for the
future. Well done!
Even though the rest of us
weren't fighting, the organisers
were sure to keep us busy. In
kendo, a minimum of five people
is required to run each two minute
long match, and without Imperial-
trained rigorous workers, the
matches couldn't have run.
Despite the defeat of our own
team, we still had things to cele-
brate - our much loved teacher
and coach, Emiko, won the ladies
individual event. Last but definitely
not least, a very special thanks to
Mr Mabuchi for representing us as
part of the Imperial squad.
It is now official! Imperial College
Volleyball Club has the best
Women's team in London! Our
superb players beat UCL 3-1 last
week and thereby clinched top
place in the BUSA London com-
petition.
And what a superb match it
was! After loosing the first set,
due to a succession of unforced
errors which saw the opposition
build-up a lead of 15 points, IC
came back and clinched 3 sets in
a row to win the match. But there
was tension all the way through -
it wasn't easy, believe me! The
2nd and 4th sets were incredibly
close, since in both of them the
teams were levelled at 23-23,
two points before the end!
So, nail-biting stuff as usual,
but Imperial's women showed
their characteristic grit and win-
ning spirit that enabled them to
finish on top. Everybody played
well, but special mention has to
be given to Janice, since it was
her attacking serve in the first set
that provided the clue to what the
tactics in the following sets
should be (nice lesson to the
coach...) Cheers too to the brave
captain, Sandrine, who cleverly
asked for a substitution near the
closure of the match so that she
could rest for a couple of min-
utes, and then came back onto
the field to win the match with a
serious of deciding blocks and a
fantastic last serve. And what
about the attacking and digging
skills showed by Courtney, Lucia
and Raphaelle! Wow! That's all I
have to say!
Think your team rocks?
Then tell us about it!
IC boys aren t easy
Ultimate Frisbee
The weekend of the 20th and 21 st
November saw the Student Indoor
Ultimate Qualifiers for the South-
east region held at Sussex Univer-
sity. The majority of the Imperial
crew descended to Brighton at
some ungodly hour on Saturday
morning, to be there for the 9.30
start. The first three matches
would be from within a pool of
four teams, and the top two in
each pool going then went into
the quarter final playoffs (with the
winners of the playoffs guaranteed
a place in the national student
indoor finals).
Our first match was against
Kings (aka NoneOfTheAbove),
from which much groaning was
received, considering the rivalry
between the two London teams.
After yelling our newly adopted
motto "There's no I in TEAM!" we
went onto the pitch to kick some
royal butt. The first three points
went Kings way. However, the Dis-
cDoctors kept their heads high
and proceeded to get several
points on the trot, and Fukwit
calmed down after his first drop to
prove that he was a damn fine
injury substitute. Towards the end,
Kings snatched one last point, but
we finally won 6-4. After our
"warm up game" we then had to
face Sub Patriots 3 (aka
Portsmouth or PDQ). The drub-
bing of Portsmouth involved lots of
experimental set plays, so the
match was a little scrappy, but
nice cuts and passes from Big Gay
and Jesus helped us finish 11-3.
The final lambs sent to the slaugh-
ter within our pool were Mohawks
2 (aka Brighton). The game was
very experimental once again, but
with Diva running round like a
rabbit on fire and Spirit exhibiting
his very solid play, we managed to
wallop them 10-3. Time for the
Quarterfinals.
We were now against Skunks
2 (Southampton) and word of
mouth was flying round that
"Imperial were crap" and "Skunks
2 should easily win". Fatal last
words, I'm afraid. IC stopped
experimenting and played in our
normal crushing manner. The well
oiled combination of Worship Me
and Waterboy flattened Skunks 2
faster than "Mind that bus",
"What bus?", "Splat!". We quali-
fied for the finals after dicking on
Skunks 2 1 3-3.
That was the end of the first
days indoor play, and the charity
match followed outdoors - in the
rain where it was cold and wet,
with Jesus, Diva and Worship Me
playing from Imperial's DiscDoc-
tors.
Sunday - Semi finals and
onwards day. As we were in the
top 4, we didn't have to start until
the afternoon, so we all got a lay
in (lovely). We faced Strange Blue
(aka Cambridge) in the semi-
finals, and yet again, the opposi-
tion thought that they had the easy
tie of the round. Whoops. It was a
tight fought game, which had
"Blue" fighting for their life to stay
in the lead for all of the match. In
the last three minutes of the
game, IC scored two points to
level the scores and force sudden
death extra-time. Unfortunately
"Blue" got the last point to finish
7-6 up, but we proved that its
hard to beat IC.
Our final match was against
Mohawks 1 , who also had a tight
semi-final game. Yet again we
had a hard fought match, but
Astrofuk proved that he was more
than a pretty face with a defence
that was not only tighter than a
ducks butt, but also distracted the
opposition quite admirably. Yet
again, we hit sudden death (this
time they managed to get the
draw), which we won to finish 9-8
up and in third place (thus match-
ing our original seeding).
Special commendations need
to go to Diva for his imperson-
ations of a Nutcracker ballerina
and a monkey for some of the
after match calls, and also to the
oral skills of Mrs Worship Me
(well, he looked happy).
