C O M E BACK DOCUCENTRE,
ALL IS FORGIVEN
Dear Felix,
An essential student service has
disappeared from the South Kens-
ington campus. The Xerox DocU-
center, which had previously pro-
vided a range of reprographic serv-
ices for a reasonable charge has
disappeared. In its place there are
now a couple of card operated
black and white copiers, a facility
which is already provided at many
locations throughout college.
The DocUcenter died sudden-
ly; just before students returned
after the summer break. The day
before the closure staff were happi-
ly accepting assignments, promis-
ing that they would be ready for
collection later in the week. Cus-
tomers returned to find signs on the
doors saying the DocUcenter had
been closed. The service had van-
ished without informing or consult-
ing its users. In previous years
changes to the copyshop have
been accompanied by front page
news coverage in Felix. A week or
so after the start of term, the DocU-
center reopened in its present
incarnation.
Today's situation has been
described as an inconvenience for
clubs, and a big problem for stu-
dents. There is no longer anywhere
on the South Kensington campus
where it is possible to request that
a particular chapter of a book, or a
file of notes are copied, and return
to collect them later.
The recent history of copyshops
on the IC walkway is not particular-
ly bright. The reason .given for the
demise of the DocUcenter was that
it was not making any money.
However in the past it has been
proved that it is possible to run a
viable copying business on the
walkway. Callprint, who ran the
business until May 1997 before
losing the contract to Xerox, were
about to embark on an expansion
of their sen/ices. It was envisaged
that eventually students would be
able to transmit a file from any
computer then collect the finished
Feedback
product at the shop.
The return of a copyshop pro-
viding services such as: T-shirt
printing; poster creation; laminat-
ing and binding would be of enor-
mous use to both clubs and indi-
viduals. Copyshops are able to sur-
vive on high streets, so why not on
the IC walkway?
The Senior Common Room
redevelopment will provide a retail
unit which would be an excellent
location for a profitable copyshop.
I would suggest that there is no one
better placed to run the service,
than iCU. I would love to see the
iCU logo plastered all over the
SCR's new curvy glass walls. The
business would be run altruistically,
and profits used to benefit students.
As it would be providing a service
for students, it should not matter if
it were not a big money spinning
venture. Although unlikely, in an
ideal world college would look
favourably on an iCU run venture,
which would provide a useful serv-
ice to the college community.
What iCU attempt to do,
depends on what students want. If
iCU does not run the copyshop it
should be pushing for college to
re-examine the options open to it:
perhaps the copyshop contract
should be put out to tender again.
This would give the large high
street reprographics companies an
opportunity to trade in a fantastic
location, and at the same time pro-
vide a good deal for IC students.
The service that was provided
by the DocUcenter and its prede-
cessors was one that made a con-
siderable difference to those stu-
dents who used it, and will be
missed.

FAIR PAY F O R ALL
Dear Felix,
I note that our equal opportu-
nities officer has persuaded ICU
to support the NUS march for stu-
dent rights at ULU this week. The
posters all state that the aims are
'No to fees & student hardship'
and 'yes' to decent pay. I presume
the decent pay bit is supposd to
mean pay for all those students
who have to work part time to
suuport their studies. If this is the
case, and he is serious in his
aims, he need look no further
than IC & iCU themseleves who
both employ IC students on rates
of pay barely above the very low
minimum set by the Government.
iCU currently pay most of their
staff a paltry £3.70 per hour while
dear old ULU can only scrape
together a barely more
respectable £3.88. Is it any won-
der that many departmnts in the
Union are short of staff this year
when their pay and conditions
have slipped so far behind other
employers (even McD for good-
ness sake!) in the area. ICU
should not be so hypocritical to
criticise others for something it
does itself.

ENGINEERS ARE BEST.....?
Dear Felix,
I write in response to the letter
from Matt Cockayne (RSMU Presi-
dent) published in Felix 1158, 22
November. In particular, I take
particular pride and pleasure in
answering the "big question" he
invites Guilds students to ask
myself and the other elected
members of the CGCU Executive
Committee.
Social and recreational skills
can only be strengthened by an
event as successful as Atlantis, our
Freshers' Dinner. By all accounts,
this event - attended by well in
excess of two hundred people,
mostly freshers - was a success
and a great time was had by all
who bothered to turn up. CGCU
has actually managed to, addi-
tionally, make a healthy profit on
the dinner; as I understand it, this
The deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon - drop into the porta-
cabins or email felix@ic.ac.uk. Letters may be edited for length but not grammar or spelling.
