Anxious asbestos alarm Ethnic elite disappoint
SUNIL R A O
A large section of the student pop-
ulace will have noticed last week's
restricted level of service from the
Main Dining Hall (MDH) on the
ground floor of Sherfield.
This was due to the detection
of a small quantity of asbestos in
the lagging for two or three pipes
in the back of the Sherfield Build-
ing, found during the preparatory
work being carried out for the
Senior Common Room (SCR)
redevelopment on the floor
above. This in turn has caused the
sealing-off and closure of part of
the College kitchens while the
asbestos is removed.
Due to the health risks associ-
ated with asbestos, all the neces-
sary precautions have been taken
to ensure there is no contamina-
tion of food whatsoever. The
affected contaminated areas have
been professionally sealed off,
with constant monitoring of air
quality in place to guard against
there being any kind of leakage
while the asbestos is being
removed. The work was not
expected to be on a large scale at
all. In fact, the original estimate
for the completion of the neces-
sary removal work was just one
week. The majority of the time was
expected to be taken up by the
actual setting up and' taking down
of the required safety-related
structures and equipment, which
ensure that none of the dangerous
fibres escape detection.
Felix were unable to contact
Edward Lilley, the Catering Man-
ager, before going to press. How-
ever, we have been reliably
informed that the problem is well
under control, and the Main Din-
ing Hall should be back up and
running at its full levels of service
very shortly, quite possibly by the
time this issue is published.
SUNIL RAO
Research being carried out at
Goldsmith's College suggests that
the racial or ethnic origin of a stu-
dent at Cambridge often has an
effect on the class of degree that
student finally ends up with.
A study that has examined
degree results for the years of
1997 and 1998 has revealed
what many have long suspected -
there is a statistically significant
relationship between the ethnic
background of a student and the
class of degree the student finally
ends up with.
The picture isn't all negative -
the study shows that while only
27% of Indians who apply to
Cambridge actually get in, 24% of
those that do walk away with a
first, as opposed to the 2 1 % of
white undergraduates that do.
However, only one black student
out of the 32 surveyed gained a
first at Cambridge, and with just
six blacks getting a 2:1 or better
(as opposed to 80% of all white
students), the figures illustrate
quite clearly how ethnicity is asso-
ciated with academic inequality at
Cambridge. Moreover, almost a
sixth of all black students there get
a third, whereas just one Chinese
student surveyed (out of 56)
obtained a third in the past two
years. The survey clearly has
weaknesses in the numbers sur-
veyed, but the results are still sig-
nificant.The research is still ongo-
ing and is part of an effort to
ensure equality at the university.
Encouragingly, 1 999 shows a
doubling in the number of black
applicants accepted at the univer-
sity.
Government policy dictates
that all British universities must
take immediate steps to combat
institutional racism wherever it is
identified.
