Ever been to M a l e t Street? There's
not m u c h there except for the Virgin
Megastore a n d a drab old pub called
the " D u c k a n d Dive". It has recently
had a makeover, but like most recent
makeovers in London it has been a
conquest of style over substance.
The Duck a n d Dive is in a n unfor-
tunate position. O v e r the years, it has
had many managers (on average
one per year), wh o have struggled to
maintain the clientele. W h i l e the
locals seem quite happy t o g o there
occasionally, it seems that everybody
else can't be bothered to spend half
an hour a n d two pints-worth of cash
getting there.
Luckily, this pub has s o m e very
u n d e r s t a n d i n g s h a r e h o l d e r s , w h o
seem quite willing to throw stupen-
dous amounts of c o l o u r e d notes
through the d o o r in order to repair
s o m e quite nasty holes in the paper-
work. Sadly, the holes never g o away.
So why should you care? After
all, you lot never g o there (and I can't
say I blame you), so it makes no dif-
ference, right? W r o n g . O n e of the
"shareholders" mentioned above is
you, in a roundabout way. U L U is
funded by the colleges of the Univer-
sity of London, through money given
to them by the Higher Education
F u n d i n g C o u n c i l , ring-fenced f o r
"student services". This means that if
they didn't spend it o n U L U , they
w o u l d have to spend it on you.
A n d how m u c h is involved? T h e
fairly major sum of £90,000 each
a n d every year - more than e n o u g h to
save a library or two.
This isn't heresy, if you stop a n d
think about it. H o w many of us actu-
ally g o a n d use the facilities that w e
pay for so handsomely? The n u m -
bers are pretty small. S o m e people
g o there for the clubs a n d societies,
but the number of clubs that U L U pro-
vides that ICU doesn't can be count-
ed o n the fingers of one hand. I'm
sure some people will write in saying
that they g o for the social life a n d that
they love it, but I'd bet that the major-
ity of you w o u l d m u c h rather see a n
extra £90,000 each year p u m p e d
into improving our own facilities.
O n e argument that has been
used in the past is that U L U sporting
clubs provide a standard of competi-
tion that o u r own clubs can't match. I
have n o issue with this - it's c o m -
pletely true. However, better funding,
better organisation, a n d better facili-
ties f o r o u r own sporting clubs will
s o o n render this distinction invisible.
Roll on the advent of the IC Athletics
U n i o n , a n d s o o n we'll have n o rea-
son to be in U L U at all.
If the student body agree to that,
the Rector c a n finally e n g a g e the final
phase of his master plan, a n d the
C o l l e g e can secede from the Univer-
sity altogether. N o n e of us will ever
again have to bear the shame of hav-
ing the s a m e degree certificate as
lesser beings from U C L a n d Q M W . . .
FANTASTIC
Kensington a n d C h e l s e a have a new m e m b e r o f
Parliament, elected at last Thursday's by-election.
M a n y people have used the m e d i a attention g e n -
erated by an election to their advantage; at the last
general election a local businessman, " M r M o n g o -
lian Barbecue", stood for "The M o n g o l i a n Barbe-
cue, A G r e a t Place T o " party. A couple of weeks
a g o an IC student was considering standing for the
parliamentary seat. The student was in negotiations
with a n internet c o m p a n y w h o h a d offered to pay
him to c h a n g e his n a m e to M r www.funmail.co.uk,
and to stand against M r Portillo. With the large stu-
dent population in the constituency, there w o u l d
have been an excellent c h a n c e of the candidate not
losing his deposit, had the c o m p a n y not pulled out
at the last minute. The student; who else but every-
body's favourite president, Dave Hellard?
SINGING FROM THE STAIRS
Have you ever w o n d e r e d why the staircase in the
foyer of the B M S building is so big, a n d in such a n
obstructive position? Although this question is yet to
be answered, a use has been found for the impres-
sive structure. A choir, " C a n t o Villanella", m a d e u p
of both medics a n d scientists from IC, are g o i n g to
be singing from the stairs at 1 3 . 0 0 this Tuesday
lunchtime. They will b e enhancing the building's
environment, serenading people eating at the B M S
cafe. The content of the gig has been described to
Kevin as: " G o i n g from serious to silly".
IN SEARCH OF THE LIGHT
Ghosts, U F O s , a n d the p a r a n o r m a l . There is n o
forum for discussion of such matters within Imperi-
al C o l l e g e . Kevin w o u l d like to know why. Kevin
knows he wasn't the only person wh o was c o m p r e -
hensively s p o o k e d by the fake d o c u m e n t a r y :
" G h o s t W a t c h " presented by M i k e Smith and Sarah
G r e e n , when it was shown on TV about eight years
a g o . Kevin believes that people who have experi-
enced the paranormal are privileged to have done
so, a n d ought to share their experience with others.
Kevin urges anyone interested to contact him o n
kevin@ic.ac.uk.

CULTURE CLASH
M e d i c a l students living in halls such as Wilson
House have "voiced some disquiet about being
mixed with other students." The reason given was
that they felt that their course: " w a s o n e that
required great d e m a n d s from them a n d this could
be m a d e easier if they were together." Kevin is
a m a z e d at the implied insinuation that non-medical
students are a rowdy bunch whose presence is not
conducive to work. Thankfully, it was final year stu-
dents w h o had m a d e these comments. Although a
quick c o m p a r i s o n between Prince Albert a n d
Guildsheet will confirm that there is still a world of
difference between the medic a n d non-medic cul-
tures, the new medics certainly see themselves as IC
students, a n d d o not hold the anti-IC prejudices of
the older students. Kevin is confident that IC will
b e c o m e " o n e big happy family", even if it does
take s o m e time.
MICROSOFT MAYHEM
Please would s o m e o n e from the C C S take a few
seconds to configure the O u t l o o k w e b access
device correctly. T h e problem lies with the 'Sent
M a i l Folder', which has been bizarrely set up so that
it does not tell the user w h o the recipient of the mes-
sages was. Instead it displays the n a m e of the per-
son w h o sent the messages. W h i l e this may be use-
ful to entities like Kevin, w h o possess a plethora of
identities, it is just an a n n o y a n c e to the majority of
users. Kevin w o u l d not be at all surprised if the fault
he has spotted is in fact a feature of the Microsoft
system, which will not be fixed until the next extor-
tionately expensive upgrade.
SHAKEN NOT STIRRED
Recently in one of IC's high tech lecture theatres,
the lecturer attempted to adjust the lights. After
spending a few seconds pressing buttons on the TV
style remote control, it a p p e a r e d that the lights were
not g o i n g to respond. The lecturer decided to c o n -
tinue. Shortly after restarting the lights d i m m e d , the
front of the r o o m was strongly illuminated, a n d the
electronically operated curtains started to close.
The lecturer, was stunned, remarking " W h e n that
sort of thing happens I always expect a d i s e m b o d -
ied voice to b o o m out: ' G o o d evening M r Bond.' "
