has hardly ever been the case in
the past. We have all but written
off the (actually very small) losses
we made on our previous failures.
I think it has been pretty convinc-
ingly demonstrated that, despite
our ambitiousness, we can organ-
ise, publicise and pull off success-
ful events on a decent scale. We
are painfully aware of our previ-
ous failures, but we have moved
on, and harping critics would do
well to do the same.
Anyway, yes, as I've stated in
my news article, we did attract
over a quarter of all Guilds fresh-
ers - certainly something more
difficult than attracting half the
freshers of a much, much smaller
and more cohesive union full of
people with wonderfully brilliant
"social and interpersonal skills".
Happy, Matt?
Yours sincerely,

A N D FINALLY...
Dear Sir,
It has come to my attention that
this year marks the fiftieth anniver-
sary of your esteemed publication.
Will you be doing anything to mark
this auspicious occasion, which
falls on December 9th?
