Imperial C o l l e g e ' s s e e m i n g l y e n d -
less quest f o r e x p a n s i o n will take
a n o t h e r m a j o r step f o r w a r d next
summer, w h e n a massive n e w c a m -
pus is a d d e d to the C o l l e g e . W y e
C o l l e g e will a d d several n e w disci-
plines, almost 1 0 0 0 students, a n d
several h u n d r e d acres of f a r m l a n d
to the C o l l e g e , a l o n g with the title
of "third oldest e d u c a t i o n a l institu-
tion in the U K " (the f o u n d a t i o n s of
Wye were laid in the mid-fifteenth
century).
S o , what's g o i n g o n ? W h e r e ,
what a n d w h o is W y e C o l l e g e , a n d
why o n Earth is this s e e m i n g l y
o b s c u r e outpost of the University of
L o n d o n a b o u t to b e a d d e d to the
IC Empire?
Where?
Wye C o l l e g e is to b e f o u n d d e e p in
the heart of rural Kent, not f a r f r o m
Ashford a n d a l o n g w a y off the
beaten track, having b e e n f o u n d e d
in 1 4 4 7 by C a r d i n a l J o h n K e m p e
as a c o l l e g e f o r priests. W h e n the
merger w a s first a n n o u n c e d , m u c h
was m a d e of A s h f o r d ' s role as a
m a j o r spur in the C h a n n e l Tunnel
project - w h e n the m u c h v a u n t e d
rail-link finally c o m e s on-line, land
values a r o u n d A s h f o r d a r e likely to
rocket, as freight a n d h a u l a g e c e n -
tres b e c o m e two-a-penny. T h e C o l -
lege's ultimate plans f o r its c o p i o u s
g r o u n d s has still to b e d e t e r m i n e d .
H o w e v e r , W y e ' s a c a d e m i c
i m p o r t a n c e s h o u l d not b e u n d e r e s -
timated. A l t h o u g h largely u n h e a r d
of a m o n g s t the g e n e r a l p o p u l a c e
(a p r o b l e m all IC students k n o w
well), W y e is in fact o n e of the f o r e -
most centres f o r agricultural t e a c h -
ing a n d research in the U K (the n e w
agricultural courses will be a d d e d
to the Royal S c h o o l of M i n e s , a n d
may eventually b e c o m e a part of
the Huxley School) - i n d e e d the
reaction of the first W y e students I
s p o k e to w a s that they f e a r e d that
the quality a n d w o r t h o f their
degrees w o u l d d i m i n i s h as a result
of the merger.
W y e a l s o h a s s o m e d e c e n t
research a n d t e a c h i n g g r o u p s in
plant a n d a n i m a l biology, country-
side m a n a g e m e n t a n d the (now
obligatory) study of m a n a g e m e n t .
A b o v e a l l , however, it's W y e ' s rep-
utation f o r c r o p a n d G M research
that h a s most attracted the h a n d of
Imperial, a n d d r a w n the long-lost
C o l l e g e b a c k into the limelight.
How?
A s of A u g u s t 1 st next year, W y e will
b e c o m e a part of Imperial C o l l e g e
(and it's students will b e c o m e m e m -
bers of Imperial C o l l e g e Union) -
so w h a t differences will w e notice?
W e l l , to begin with, p r o b a b l y n o n e .
W y e students will remain in Kent
a n d Imperial students will r e m a i n in
South K e n - there certainly don't
s e e m to be any plans to m o v e bits
of C o l l e g e d o w n there in the f o r e -
s e e a b l e future. However, over the
next c o u p l e of years w e c a n expect
to see a slight realignment of cer-
tain departments, as they m e r g e
with their W y e counterparts, l e a d -
ing to the f o r m a t i o n of several "with
a year in W y e " courses (most p r o b -
ably in certain B i o l o g i c a l disciplines
a n d p e r h a p s elements of the Huxley
School). Similarly, the r e m a i n i n g
W y e courses (all courses w h i c h
o v e r l a p those at IC s e e m set to dis-
a p p e a r ) will p r o b a b l y m o v e
towards including spells in South
K e n . A n d the net result? In all like-
l i h o o d , m o r e students o n the South
Ken c a m p u s . . . .
The other element of the m e r g -
er (sadly the terms " t a k e o v e r " a n d
" b u y o u t " don't exist in a c a d e m i c
terms) is a n o r g a n i s a t i o n a l o n e . A s
the m e d i c a l mergers brought the
rank of " p r i n c i p a l " to IC, the W y e
m e r g e r will introduce the c o n c e p t
of " p r o v o s t s " , with the s e n i o r a c a -
d e m i c at Imperial to b e d e e m e d the
Provost of Imperial at W y e (note
that this will be a separate role to
that of a h e a d of d e p a r t m e n t o r
d e a n of a constituent c o l l e g e , as
W y e will be neither). B e y o n d this,
the exact o r g a n i s a t i o n a l m a k e - u p is
still unclear, a n d will d e p e n d o n the
exact format of the course structure
that is eventually a g r e e d . In U n i o n
t e r m s , h o w e v e r , a semi-
a u t o n o m o u s W y e U n i o n (run as a
sub-section of ICU) seems the most
likely o u t c o m e , with the question of
a s a b b a t i c a l W y e President still to
be d e b a t e d (note that W y e don't
have a s a b b a t i c a l at present, but
the n e e d f o r regular contact with
the South K e n c a m p u s m a y m a k e
o n e essential).
Where next?
So, c o n s i d e r i n g that over the course
of three years the C o l l e g e will have
g r o w n to the tune of a c o u p l e of
t h o u s a n d students a n d four m a i n
c a m p u s e s (note that this list doesn't
include St M a r y ' s , w h o have b e e n
part of IC since 1 9 8 7 ) , w h e r e a r e
we h e a d i n g ? H a v i n g g a i n e d m e d i -
cine a n d agriculture as extra strings
to o u r bow, what notable a b s e n c e s
remain (bearing in m i n d that the
C o l l e g e charter is strict o n the fact
that Imperial must remain scientif-
i c / t e c h n o l o g i c a l in outlook)?
W e l l , if c a m p u s g o s s i p is to be
believed, veterinary science is the
next m a j o r target, with the Royal
Veterinary C o l l e g e a s u g g e s t e d
g o a l . However, with the p r o b l e m s
s u r r o u n d i n g m e d i c a l m e r g e r s
across L o n d o n a n d the controversy
a c c o m p a n y i n g U C L ' s c o n t i n u i n g
attempts to take over every other
c o l l e g e in the University of L o n d o n
( S O A S a n d SEESS a r e presently at
the t o p of their hit list), the driving
forces b e h i n d the m e r g e r processes
seem to have d i e d d o w n , at least
for the m o m e n t .
N o n e t h e l e s s , it' almost o n e -
h u n d r e d percent certain that m e r g -
ers will c o n t i n u e t o b e a t o p priori-
ty f o r the h e a d s of all of the Univer-
sity of L o n d o n ' s m a j o r C o l l e g e s (IC,
U C L , Q M W , Kings, LSE a n d Royal
H o l l o w a y ) , b e c a u s e only through
c o n t i n u e d e x p a n s i o n c a n these c o l -
leges generate the impetus a n d the
f i n a n c i n g necessary to d e v e l o p a n d
r e g e n e r a t e their c a m p u s e s a n d
facilities - a n d n o w h e r e is this m o r e
i m p o r t a n t that at Imperial. T h e
m e d i c a l m e r g e r g a v e us a nice
shiny n e w b u i l d i n g (soon to be
joined by a s e c o n d w h e n the M D R B
b e c o m e s a reality) a n d the W y e
m e r g e r will u n d o u b t e d l y help to
finance the R S M r e d e v e l o p m e n t (as
well as giving us a n incredibly
impressive fifteenth century C a m -
bridge-style q u a d in Kent). A s is
often p o i n t e d o u t , unlike O x b r i d g e
(or m a n y other universities) the C o l -
lege h a s very little spare cash to
finance n e w initiatives, a n d c o n s e -
quently it's only t h r o u g h mergers
that N o r m a n Foster's vision of
C a m p u s Renaissance c a n b e c o m e
a reality...
