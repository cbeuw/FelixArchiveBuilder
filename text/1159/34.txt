IC V 6
Goldsmiths IV 6
After last weeks outstanding per-
formance against the medics to take
us joint top in the division, IC V's
were in confident mood, intent on
keeping the run of wins going to
move clear of the pack.
But Goldies had different ideas,
and they brought a team of mouthy
big ba*****s, who spent the whole
game shouting abuse at us and the
ref. They could play a bit too, unfor-
tunately, and after a first half in
which we had our butts kicked, we
were 4-0 down at the break, with
our defence and midfield having no
answer to the Goldies power
But the IC V's never say die, and
we got stuck in straight away in the
second half, the game suddenly
looking more even. Then, on about
55 mins, a free kick was awarded
about 30 yards out. On advice from
the captain, JP stepped up and had
a crack, which sailed unstoppably
into the net, off the underside of the
cross-bar (practically taking their
keeper with it). 4-1. The muted cel-
ebrations showed we were still well
adrift in the game, but we suddenly
kicked into gear, our attacking play
stemming from MOM performances
from Tom W and JP in midfield, with
Rich and Tiger putting in tireless
work out wide, and the front two of
Tom L and Vine showing they had
the beating of Goldies back line. A
second goal arrived from the boot
of Tom W, a great shot from the
edge of the area. We sensed there
was a way back, and scored a third
from Spaceman, before JP decided
that one 30 yard screamer was not
enough for the day, and thumped in
another fantastic goal for 4-4. A
cool finish from Spaceman when
one on one with the keeper after a
great through ball from Tom put us
into the lead, and when Vine placed
a brilliant far post header back
across the goal and in, it was 6-4,
and we had come from the dead
with six unanswered goals.
Sadly, the effort we had put in
began to tell, and with 10 minutes
still to go a hopeful Goldies shot
flew into the top corner to make the
last moments of the game all too
close. With only seconds to go, a
cross from the left came over, elud-
ing our defence, and the header
looped in to make it 6-6. Shit.
IC VII more
RVC less
After last weeks thrashing of the
Pharmacists, we arrived at this
match looking for another team to
destroy. We arrived slightly late
thanks to some inept coach driving,
but we still got there.
Despite the gloomy conditions,
spirits were high. Unfortunately, we
were playing into the wind in the
first half and RVC made full use of
this, putting pressure on our
defence right from the start. Even-
tually the break that RVC had
deserved came from a corner when
they exploited our lack of height to
get a head towards goal, beating
the otherwise superb keeper all
ends up - fortunately man-of-the-
match Andy Smith was there to
head it away. Unfortunately it
dropped straight to one their play-
ers who calmly put it in the back of
the net. After a while we picked
ourselves up, and with the weather
brightening we pressed forward,
with Marcus finally putting the ball
in the net, after Mark squared him
right on the stroke of half time. The
debate still rages over whether it
was intentional or Mark missed yet
another blatant opportunity.
Lifted by the goal and an inspi-
rational team talk by the guv'nor,
IC pressed forward in the second
half, finally getting into the lead
when a corner from Leacho man-
aged to work its way to Matt, who
placed it clinically into the back of
the net (well that's how he tells it
anyway). Pressing forward as we
were, we soon discovered the
match wasn't over as RVC broke
several times, at one point aided by
Barney (the team alcoholic) who
aimed to clear the ball but man-
aged to make contact with nothing
but air, letting their striker clean
through on goal. Fortunately,
Caprano was on hand to make a
match winning challenge. The only
other point worth mentioning was
when Andy Smith, obviously bored
with playing defence, tried to score
from about thirty yards out. Longley
collected the ball on the left touch-
line - nice try Andy but better stick
to defence. A pretty good perform-
ance by the team as a whole and
another win to chalk up. We're
starting our run - watch out Gold's,
here we come.
Ladies edged out by UCL Netball slay St. George's

UCL 46
IC 44
The game started well, since UCL
did not use the full court press
right away (as we had feared
before the game), and we man-
aged to stick to their score and
occasionally even move ahead by
a few points.
At the end of the first half,
UCL was ahead by 4 points. But
tiredness in the middle of the sec-
ond half made us make some
mistakes, while our opponents
were still sharp and stole a cou-
ple of balls, putting us down by
as much as 12 points. After a
time-out to re-adjust our posi-
tions, we did a few nice actions
that brought us back to within just
two points with 15 seconds
remaining on the clock. Unfortu-
nately, we did not manage that
last basket...
But cheer up everyone! This
results shows again the high
potential of this year's team.
Indeed, King's College, the only
team who beat us before this
game, lost by more than 1 Opoints
against UCL, scoring only 25.
(We will see how much we
improved, since we should play
them next week).
Moreover, we really deserved
the victory and we will have it
next time we meet UCL (maybe
some improvement on free-
throws will help?)
Hopefully, the second game
of this week against RUMS (new-
comers to the league) should be
easier...

St George's II 26
Our first league match of the sea-
son started with a convincing win
and a fantastic match. Having
drawn 17-17 with St. George's first
team a few weeks ago in the BUSA
league, we were determined to put
in a good effort - and we did not
disappoint.
Jess played an absolute blind-
er, taking on nearly every St.
George's player and intercepting
passes that went anywhere near
her. The St. George's players got
annoyed. We loved it!
Shirley (the !egend that is) also
had a storming game, zipping
around the circle and shooting
some serious hoops. A medal goes
to Sarah, our other shooter, for her
patience and restraint in not deck-
ing the St. George's keeper at
numerous points during the match
when the marking got particularly
"tight". The physical tension in the
circle became apparent in the third
quarter when the bolt fixing the net
and ring to the netball post
became dislodged and the hoop
slipped a good foot down the pole.
No matter, Shirley still scored. As
ever, Paula whipped the passes into
the circle, and later Jane, Kirstie,
Ruth and of course the ever present
Jess fed the ball up from the defen-
sive end. Partnering Rachel in the
IC goal third was Kathryn, who put
in a great performance in her
debut for the firsts as keeper. So, a
good start to the league - let's see
if we can keep it going! Next week
.... ICSM.
