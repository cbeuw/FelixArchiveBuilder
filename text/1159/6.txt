Bacterial Terrorists
Clothes that fight BO? Su-Yen Thornhill gets smelly
The nineties have seen a n increase in bacterial
warfare, not between countries but in the h o m e
- most h o u s e h o l d c l e a n i n g products advertise
s o m e sort o f a n t i m i c r o b i a l f u n c t i o n , but g o o d
o l d - f a s h i o n e d b l e a c h is still the best thing t o dis-
infect surfaces. Scientists are n o w g o i n g b a c k t o
basics a n d are f i n d i n g innovative ways of utilis-
ing c h l o r i n e - even t o c o m b a t b o d y o d o u r . But
don't worry, a r a n g e of b l e a c h bubble-bath
products is n o t a b o u t t o hit t h e market yet;
rather scientists a r e d e v e l o p i n g a n t i m i c r o b i a l
clothing that attacks bacteria while you w e a r it.
H o r s e s sweat, m e n perspire, a n d w o m e n
glow. That m a y b e a genteel way o f expressing
a slightly u n p a l a t a b l e fact, but, physiologically,
a n y b o d y w h o gets hot o r carries out exercise will
sweat w h e t h e r they are m a l e , f e m a l e or, i n d e e d ,
a h o r s e . This natural p h e n o m e n o n is vital t o
m a i n t a i n i n g a constant b o d y t e m p e r a t u r e , but to
be seen t o sweat in p u b l i c is p e r h a p s to c o m m i t
o n e o f the greatest s o c i a l faux pas in o u r c u l -
ture. S w e a t patches are c o n s i d e r e d h i d e o u s a n d
most p e o p l e frantically try t o a v o i d sweating by
d o u s i n g themselves in a range of antiperspi-
rants.
There are two types o f sweat: ordinary salty
water, which is secreted f r o m the ecrine g l a n d s
all over the body, a n d e r o g e n o u s sweat secreted
f r o m the a p o c r i n e g l a n d s that k i c k e d into action
Fair Trade?
As you read this, delegates f r o m the 1 3 5 m e m -
ber states of the W o r l d Trade O r g a n i s a t i o n will b e
meeting in Seattle t o discuss f o r t h c o m i n g a g r e e -
ments o n the o p e n i n g u p o f the w o r l d market.
This a l l sounds r e a s o n a b l e , except that what is
really g o i n g t o h a p p e n is this: e a c h country is
g o i n g t o bring a l o n g a w h o p p i n g list of wishes
a n d requests, a n d try t o get a s m a n y of them
granted as possible.
If this reminds you of those similar lists that
you posted to Father C h r i s t m a s a s a child, then
w e l c o m e t o the 'grown-up' world of international
negotiations. A n d whilst the political bickering,
p u s h i n g , shoving a n d s t a m p i n g of feet is taking
place, a rally o f protesters will b e p a r a d i n g out-
side with banners saying " N o t o g l o b a l i s a t i o n " -
a n d trouble is expected.
Two o f the m a i n issues that the protesters
a c c u s e the W T O of are p r o m o t i n g the deteriora-
tion of the environment, e n h a n c i n g g l o b a l pover-
ty a n d e n h a n c i n g the p o w e r o f giant industri-
alised states a n d multinational c o r p o r a t i o n s .
These issues are interlinked.
W h a t the W T O is a b o u t is free trade - the
world a s a h u g e s h o p p i n g mall where a n y o n e
c a n sell their products. N o w if these products are
p r o d u c e d in a way that destroys the environment,
you can't d o a thing a b o u t it. This isn't b e c a u s e
at the time of puberty. This s e c o n d a r y sweat is a
waxy oily s o l u t i o n p r o d u c e d mostly in the
armpits a n d genital a r e a s a n d its c o m p o s i t i o n is
u n i q u e t o e a c h p e r s o n . Bacteria break d o w n
sweat for f o o d , p r o d u c i n g noxious c o m p o u n d s
that give rise to the characteristic sour whiff of
B O . For s o m e p e o p l e no a m o u n t of d e o d o r a n t s
c a n c o m b a t this smell, a n d in fact the c o m b i n a -
tion of putrid sweat a n d d e o d o r a n t is often m o r e
revolting than the sweat o n its o w n .
Bacteria thrive o n b o d y surfaces a n d they
also transfer o n t o clothing. For hygienic reasons
I w o u l d h o p e that most o f you w a s h your socks
a n d u n d e r w e a r daily but perhaps it is not f e a s i -
ble t o clea n your w a r d r o b e every time you w e a r
it o r have a bath e a c h time you break out in a
sweat. C l o t h i n g that disinfects the w e a r e r w o u l d
therefore seem t o be the ideal solution.
The i d e a t o m a k e bactericidal clothing w a s
first d e v e l o p e d by scientists in C a l i f o r n i a w h o
m a n a g e d t o m a k e chlorine m o l e c u l e s a d h e r e t o
cotton fibres. The m o v e m e n t of the w e a r e r then
e n a b l e s the chlorine attached to the clothing t o
c o l l i d e with the bacteria a n d subsequently kill
t h e m . A n d o n c e the chlorine runs out the a n t i m i -
c r o b i a l function c a n b e regenerated by simply
w a s h i n g the treated fabric with a dilute chlorine
b l e a c h . Unlike antibiotics, which attack specific
targets, chlorine hits a wide r a n g e of bacterial
the W T O ignores the environment completely,
b e c a u s e it doesn't. It just m a k e s sure that the arti-
cles relating t o the protection of the environment
are written by linguists. Result: a n exception to
W T O free-trade rules that sounds as if it's pro-
environment, but actually isn't. H e n c e the U S A
s o m e years b a c k tried to b a n M e x i c a n tuna
imports b e c a u s e this tuna w a s hugely dolphin-
unfriendly because the nets tended t o trap d o l -
phins and-drown them.
The W T O article that so neatly points out that
anti-environmental products can be b a n n e d from
entering your market also implies s o m e w h e r e in
the dark recesses of the wor d in g that this e x c e p -
tion doesn't include products that are anti-envi-
ronmental in the way they are p r o d u c e d . This is
daft: most of the world's environmental problems
result from the actual production processes. S o ,
unless the tins of tuna actually emitted s o m e kind
of radioactive material or c a u s e d the surrounding
vegetation to wither o r w a r m e d u p the climate,
they were passed.
This case brings u p two issues that the p r o -
testers are s c r e a m i n g a b o u t : environmental dete-
rioration a n d the increasing p o w e r of industri-
alised giants, such as the U S .
O n the one h a n d , the W T O has overruled a n
environmental a p p r o a c h (and dolphins lost out)
Most people frantically try to avoid sweating
surface markers m a k i n g it difficult for the bacte-
ria t o b e c o m e resistant to it.
This a l l s o u n d s very neat but the question
remains - w o u l d o n e always smell of b l e a c h ,
w h i c h in itself is a s o m e w h a t unattractive
prospect a n d d o e s that m e a n w e will enter a
w o r l d w h e r e the only c o l o u r a v a i l a b l e t o us is
white? W h e t h e r constant e x p o s u r e of the skin to
a chlorine c o m p o u n d will prove harmful is
a n o t h e r q u e s t i o n , w h i c h n o d o u b t will b e
answered in the fullness of time.
and bitter infighting
but this was to the a d v a n t a g e of the less power-
ful, less industrialised nation of M e x i c o , a fact
that the m o r e radical o u t s p o k e n protesters tend
to ignore.
They also accuse the W T O of creating a
g l o b a l poverty situation by destroying self-suffi-
ciency. A g a i n this is a d e b a t a b l e issue, as the
G o v e r n m e n t of India ( G O I ) is n o w very well
aware of. It was this very a i m , that of self-suffi-
ciency, that was the main c a u s e of deforestation
a n d environmental d e g r a d a t i o n in India.
A series of five-year environmental action
plans were carried o u t from the 1 9 5 0 s , all of
them focussing essentially o n self-sufficiency.
N o n e t h e l e s s , t h e rate of d e f o r e s t a t i o n w a s
increasing. It was only w h e n the G O I got to the
7th environmental action plan that they realised
that e c o n o m i c growth c o u l d not g o h a n d in hand
with self-sufficiency.
A n d this is essentially w h a t it all boils d o w n
to: e c o n o m i c growth. This is what the W T O is
about. This is what all the d e v e l o p i n g countries
want. It seems that trade c a n o p e n this venue, but
the protesters have a point to m a k e . Things a r e
getting too 'big'. Scale is the issue. T h e g l o b a l
risks are increasing in scale, a n d where the b e n -
efits are h u g e , s o are the pitfalls.
