29 November 1999 â€¢ Felix Music
Contempo
@ ICU
Maybe it was the right
night to break up with
my girlfriend. This was
the soul music of new
starts, sweeping away
old lives that don't
work. A bursting disco
force of rage against
boredom and frustra-
tion.
The singer Richard
Archer was striking
poses like a sideburned
MC Hammer, his broth-
er Steve was a bass
Samurai, steeled for
action. The horn section
gave things an extra
buzz. The crowd behind
me seemed entirely
formed of the band's
best mates, who yelled
"You beauty!" in guitarist
Steve Friend's direction,
obviously stunned at the
most basic chords.
All the Imperial College
students stood around
the edges and didn't
want to be seen shaking
their stuff to such up-
front, working class,
pop. Which was a pity,
as I was grasped by the
urge to lose it and pogo
foolishly more than
once. As frontman Rich
laments on Big Time
Promotion Man,
"maybe the kids don't
know music."

Orange Can
@ The Spot
Covent Garden at night is
full of lost souls wandering
down random alleyways,
squinting at street signs
and searching for that elu-
sive venue. For the sake of
all things holy, take an A-
Z when you go! Lamenting
aside, I was in for a treat.
The bohemian cooler-
than-thou crowd present
seemed unfazed by the
high ticket price, poor ale
quality and laughable
light show. Orange Can
are a musician's band
through and through.
For it is the music that
dominates here - to look
at them, the band seem
ready for their milk and
cookies and the lead
singer seems indifferent to
the crowd. Nonetheless,
the concentration and
effort are evident. The
ultra-chilled tunes are
clear and varied while
sonic dominance is shared
between keyboard and
guitar.
Sure, you could dismiss
Orange Can as a poor
man's Beta Band, but that
would be pretty shallow
even by present day stan-
dards. They're unlikely to
be The Next Big Thing and
neither will they slip into
obscurity. One for the
fans, perhaps.

Soulwax
@ The Borderline
Sometimes bands surprise me. They burst out
on stage and blow you away with a vigour
that you never expected them capable of
when you saw their skinny faces in NME.
Some bands, however, come across with little
more than a whimper. They cruise onto the
stage, play their songs and leave without
more than just a slight shuffle of the feet.
Somehow, between these extremes, lies the
performance of Soulwax who played the Bor-
derline the other night. Luckily, however, the
performance was one that improved as the
night went on.
Following on from the eminently forgettable
opening band Turn (or Turd as one of the bar
staff referred to them), the two Soulwax front
men appeared on the stage dressed in snappy
suits with swaggers that are usually reserved
for the cooler members of society. Sadly
though, this entrance was spoiled by their two
opening tunes which, in this situation can be
perfectly described as Turd-like. Fortunately,
from there things picked up quite nicely.
Suddenly, energy oozed from the pores of
Soulwax. The guitars and drums were better
defined, the vocals more raw and the Border-
line rocked. Not bad for a bunch of Belgians
I thought, and as this was their first appear-
ance in the country, you should expect much
of these guys in time to come.
