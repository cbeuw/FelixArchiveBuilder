Funmail says have a beer on us.co.uk!
Funmail, the free web based email service
offering a selection of over 8000 domain
names (the bit after the @) to use as an email
address, challenges you to dream up weird
and wacky alcohol inspired domain names
and get plastered as your reward for doing so!
The best domain will be added to the exist-
ing Funmail service - check it out at www.fun-
mail.co.uk - so that everyone can benefit from
your creativity, and the winning creator will
receive a crate of beer with our e-thanks.
Funmail already offers you great addresses
for when you're drunk from
you@mashed.co.uk, you@pisshead.co.uk to
you@out-of-it.co.uk, but want some more
because, for some strange reason, university
students seem to be quite taken by them!
Send as many ideas for 'drunken' domain
names as you want to felix@ic.ac.uk, or drop
your suggestions into the Felix Office (in the
portacabins by the back of Physics, hidden
behind the liquid nitrogen tank).
The winner will be the person who comes
up with the most inventive domain name, as
chosen from the entries received by our Fun-
mail panel. The prize is a crate of beer and the
honour of having your domain name added to
Funmail's list.
And while you're about it, go to www.fun-
mail.co.uk and sign up now. Funmail offers
domain names to use as email addresses cov-
ering every mood, event and occasion. Email
just got more fun.
