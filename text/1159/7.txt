The End is Nigh
Never mind the Millennium Bug, the best is yet to come. Ian gets apocalyptic.
Your P C passed 9 / 9 / 9 9 without self-destructing.
(Were you even a w a r e that day last S e p t e m b e r
was meant to b e a crunch point in its short life?)
C o m e next year, the millennium bug will have
turned out to b e just a m i n o r blip. M a y b e a plane
did d r o p out the sky, but who's to say it w o u l d
n't have crashed anyway? However, the latest
urban myth d o i n g the rounds indicates that
what you've really got to worry a b o u t is
the Y 5 G b u g . This "myth" is based o n /
better science than your a v e r a g e
legend. Here's the facts...
The sun, o u r nearest m a i n
sequence star, is a great b i g
H-bomb. This b o m b contin-
uously releases c o p i o u s j
r Hi M I i. 'i . i 'l . n 'I
hydrogen nuclei are s m a s h e d
together so violently that they fuse t o
form heavier isotopes o f hydrogen a n d then heli-
um. So, should o u r sun, like a b o m b , b e blowing
itself to bits? N o . The sun keeps strong reins o n its
fuel. The immense mass o f the sun means it has
similarly i m m e n s e gravity. The explosive force try-
ing to spread the sun widely out into the solar sys-
tem is b a l a n c e d by its gravity, keeping it squished
up in o n e place. This b a l a n c e has held sway for
all the time life on earth has k n o w n the sun a n d a
long time before.
Here's the (giga)bug. W h e n o u r solar system
was created, the m a c h i n e was given only a finite
a m o u n t o f fuel. The sun is using over 3 million
tonnes of its mass per s e c o n d , converting it to
energy, including the heat a n d light w e enjoy
(from a safe distance) here o n Earth. The point is,
there's a limit to the sun's fuel supplies. Thanks to
this lack of forward planning (with n o re-fuelling
operation contemplated) after 5 billion years
(Y5G) the sun will have to fuse helium into heav-
ier elements. The gravitational reins will b e c o m e
weaker. The sun will swell in size, cutting d o w n o n
the 1 5 0 million-km separation of sun a n d earth. It
II engulf Mercury. Earth will get hot. The rel-
ative c o o l of the M a r t i a n climate wil!
b e c o m e a n attractive prospect for
/'J ' y o u r holidays.

O f course, eventually the sun will c o o l a n d
contract, a n d what's left o n Earth will freeze solid,
including o u r a t m o s p h e r e . But w e won't b e

This isn't on the course but....
N o . l : M a x w e l l ' s D e m o n
Maxwell's D e m o n was a sweet little creature w h o sorted out hot particles from c o l d
o n e s. J a m e s C l e r k M a x w e l l was not too pleased by his devilish creation because he
practiced the mysterious art of "Thermodynamics" - watching gas in a box. From a
layperson's perspective, there can't be a n awful lot that is mysterious a b o u t gas in a
box, o n e w o u l d expect it to just sit there. Nevertheless, a lot o f physically important
discoveries were m a d e in the last century by gas-in-a-box watchers. O n e such rev-
elation was the principle of entropy: the 'messiness' of the universe is always increasing. This princi-
ple, m o r e c o m m o n l y k n o w u n d e r the exuberant title of "The 2 n d Law of T h e r m o d y n a m i c s " , has quite
p r o f o u n d implications o n the life a n d death of the universe. C l o s e r to h o m e , a g o o d demonstration
of this law c a n b e a c h i e v e d by observing your own b e d r o o m (it works for me).
Returning t o o u r d e m o n i c friend, if (s)he's busy sorting out particles then the world won't b e s o
messy, violating the entropy principle. Maxwell's D e m o n c o u l d play little tricks on p e o p l e , sorting out
the fast particles f r o m the slower o n e s , m e a n i n g that all the gas in a r o o m c o u l d suddenly gather
up in o n e corner... Scientists don't enjoy having their principles liberalised, so a solution to Maxwell's
D e m o n b e c a m e the g o a l o f m a n y gas-in-a-box watchers. U n a b l e to prove d e m o n s don't exist, the
p r o b l e m was finally resolved by considering what h a p p e n s t o the p o o r little devil when (s)he's sort-
ing particles. You see, a l t h o u g h the particles will b e c o m e less messy o n c e they've been sorted, the
d e m o n b e c o m e s messier - in fact, m o r e messy than the original particles. Thus, the total messiness
of the universe has increased a n d gas-in-a-box watchers c a n rejoice in the validity of the 2 n d Law.
The s a m e applies t o b e d r o o m s by the way, which explains the state of m i n e . . .
