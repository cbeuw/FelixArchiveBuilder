Cuban Boys
C. vs. I.
(EMI)
Yes! For those of you
who've listened to John
Peel during the last two
years, it's that song - in
all its rabid, wide-eyed
psycho glory. Forget the
mystery and hype, if it's
really produced by Noel
it's the best thing he's
ever done. The most
stupid, addictive, camp
dance track of this Pee-
lennium
Coal Chamber feat. Ozzy Osbourne
Shock The Monkey
(Roadrunner)
Now I don't know my metal, but I
know what's average, and it's this.
On the plus side, I'm reliably told
they're all tiny and cute - and yes, I
am a sucker for songs where they
sing "monkey!" But when that's all a
song has, you know it's time to go
back to bed and get on with dodg-
ing work.
Contempo
My One Way Out
(London)
This 'nu-Northern Soul' band from
Staines take a fair bit of getting into,
but hey, they're worth a try. The
words are very headstrong (like
Jarvis' "big plans" lyrical phase, but
maybe more grown up!) and the
soul element is all there - falsetto
backing, Space Harrier synthesiser
and all. The singer's furry like Gaz
Coombs and croons like Damon.
Now you know.
Ida 11
LeTigre
Hot Topic
(Wiiijaj
A rather refreshing
indie/dance cross-over
from some friends on
the continent. Sci-Fi
instrumentals loop in
the background, whilst
trance beats and dis-
torted vocals compli-
ment the overall feel
and make for a great
atmosphere and one
Apollo Four Forty
Heart Go Boom
(Epic)
A three-minute burst
through funksville with
the odd bit of reggae
stylee bowel-shudder-
ing bass thrown in. No
Status Quo this time
around, and I guaran-
tee the line 'diddly bop,
diddly bop, diddly bop
boing' will be on every-
body's lips before long.
Queen Adreena
X-ing Off The Days
(Warner)
Lots of passionate breathy vocals
over tribal drums and snarly guitar -
imagine Shakespeare's Sister and PJ
Harvey getting together and agree-
ing to do something really weird. A
Heavenly Surrender is so close to
the latter, in fact, that she could
probably claim royalties.
Garbage
The Worid Is Not Enough
(MCA)
Over the years, the genre of the
Bond film theme has become some-
what formulaic - lots of dark dramat-
ic strings, a few brass fanfares, that
sort of thing - and you'd be forgiven
for thinking that maybe the songs
would be sounding a little tired by
now. However, Goldeneye and
Tomorrow Never Dies have shown
that this is not the case, and here
Garbage continue this trend with a
quality tune.
Beastie Boys
Alive
(Capitol)
This is released along
with the current anthol-
ogy The Sounds of Sci-
ence, and to be honest,
basically displays all the
musical characteristics
which made the Beastie
Boys big enough to be
able to release such an
album without looking
stupidly optimistic. No
surprises then, but a
thoroughly kicking
experience neverthe-
less.
