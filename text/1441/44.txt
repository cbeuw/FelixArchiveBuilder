ICURFC begin
season in style
I.C.U.R.F.C. 1st XV played Bucking-
hamshire New University in their first
league fixture of the season. Bucks
have been old rivals to the college and
have had a cemented position in the
league for many years. The hard work
the players put into pre-season shone
through as Imperial quickly laid down
a 10 point lead. Things soon settled
down with the Imperial side dominat-
ing possession. This inevitably resulted
in more points for the away team. With
the score board ticking over Imperial
had a 17-0 lead by half time.
The second half proved to be less of a
challenge. The home team were exhaust-
ed, making it easy to control the game
and pile on the pressure. Strong defence
produced several turn over tries, which
again strengthened Imperial’s grip on
the game. Special mention goes to Hugh
Dingleberry for his amazing defence and
the impact he had on every try scored.
The final score was a 41-0 away win, a
good platform to build from for league
success.

Wednesday 21st October saw Imperial
College put on an impressive display
against one of the country’s top univer-
sity Rugby Clubs. St Mary’s University
College Men’s 2nd XV are a team that
feed their own 1st XV (frequent win-
ners of the BUCS Cup) and Harlequins
Rugby Club.
The Rugby boys were able to mount
a staggering 43-7 victory of their lo-
cal London rivals in the BUCS league.
A combination of strong defence and
well worked attack meant that Impe-
rial seemed to be able to score from
almost any situation. Once again spe-
cial mention goes to super-sub Hugh
Dingleberry for his all-round efforts.
He congratulated the players saying
that “no one deserved to be singled
out from today’s efforts. However, the
try scorers and man of the match also
played well.”
Next week Imperial College face Im-
perial Medicals, who are both the only
undefeated teams in the league.

Men return to form by conquering London
Yes, you heard correct, the men of IC
tennis are back in form and they dem-
onstrated it on Wednesday against
King’s College, winning 7-3. The ea-
ger 1st team travelled to Burgess Park,
seeking to get back on track after los-
ing their first match of the season.
The afternoon began with two very
competitive doubles matches, with the
result split between the two teams.
Imperial’s Franco-Argentinean duo,
comprising of Pio Monti and Pierre
Delestrade, took on King’s number one
doubles pair; who were equally multi-
cultured, with a typical lean, powerful,
British boy accompanied by a touchy
and wise Mauritian veteran.
The Imperial scientists started
strongly, hitting clean, laminar shots,
which earned them an early break.
However, with the Imperial boys get-
ting frustrated with the classy touch
of the Mauritian, the Kings pair came
back fiercely. The match was tight un-
til 6-6, when King’s crucially broke the
Imperial serve.
The hammering British boy then
produced what was probably the best
service game of his life, powering aces,
and although the game was brought to
deuce, the King’s lads were able to con-
clude on their solid performance and
won 8-6.
Avinash Murphy and Adam Gu-
nasekara represented Imperial in the
2nd doubles match. The duo played
solidly, holding their serve to win the
match 8-5.
With the doubles completed, the sin-
gles began. Team captain Pio comfort-
ably won the 1st singles, quickly taking
the match 6-2 6-0. Avinash played 2nd
singles, against arguably the strongest
player of the Kings squad. A combina-
tion of wet conditions and a quality op-
ponent resulted in Avinash losing his
match. Fresher Adam played only his
second match of the season in the 3rd
singles. Adam controlled the match
from the beginning, moving his op-
ponent around the court and showing
initiative. It took him little time to cash
in a 6-0 6-0 victory. Pierre played the
4th singles where he made good use of
his baseline game to dominate rallies
and finish well at the net, to take the
match 6-3 6-1.
After a day of satisfying tennis, the
team headed home for a well earned
shower and some rest before hitting
the union like the party animals you
know they are!
The Men’s 2nd Team and the Wo-
mens team did not fare so well. The
men lost 4-6 to the Greenwich 1st
team and the women lost 1-9 to
Portsmouth 1st. Better luck next
week!
