NOMINATIONS
Big Ron Atkinson is back from dis-
graced obscurity! It’s not football man-
agement, but it’s a job. After years of
applying for jobs, I’m back. 2004 was a
bad year, lads. After being caught on-
air being ‘racist’, no one would employ
me. For the last five years, I’ve been
filming a series of Angolan adverts for
various products. They love a bit casu-
al racism I reckon.
Anyway, I’m back in the limelight; the
British limelight. See the fellas above?
Rubbish. They’re all thick, lazy.......peo-
ple. I swear that description has got me
into trouble before. Who cares any-
way? I’ve managed footballing giants
such as Kettering Town, West Bromich
Albion and Aston fucking Villa. Aston
fucking Villa!
Big Ron would do a much better job
on Union Council. Engineering? I’ve
engineered Division 4-winning teams.
Medics? I once fucking played in my
short and unsucessful career with a
broken ankle for 82 minutes. Who
needs Medics? Sciences? Pah, all these
modern managers these days using
food science to get their players fit and
healthy. I forced all my players to eat a
hearty meal of dirt and porridge, with
a side serving of casual racism. Look
where it got me! Unemployed! Desper-
ate for media work! RON! Vote RON!

Like Gordon Brown, the trustee-board
is one of those things that is boring yet
very important. It is something that
few know about, less care about and
only the weirdest get excited about.
And I’m proudly one of those weirdos!
As the most senior committee of the
Union, the trustee-board oversees and
approves all major changes. If elected,
I thus promise to remain representa-
tive, open and accountable. I commit
to seek out and represent *your* views
and make sure that they are heard and
responded to. At my previous uni-
versity, I was college union president,
member of the student council and di-
rector of the university paper. I there-
fore believe I have the experience to do
a good job, the skills for staying awake
in long meetings, and (as a passionate-
cupcake-baker) the tools to keep meet-
ings happy! So, vote for Amina- vote
for representation, experience and
cupcakes!

To ensure decisions made about the
union are in the best interest of the stu-
dents an individual who is easy to ap-
proach and talk to but also confident
is required. I believe I possess these
qualities and therefore I am running for
the position of student trustee. Having
worked at an accountancy firm, two in-
vestment banks and with a trustee from
Oxfam, I feel that I am well prepared for
the technical aspect of the position too.
If elected I will endeavour to:
1) Continue to be approachable by at-
tend clubs and societies meetings in
order to understand our needs and thus
direct the union to provide services that
are needed rather than those that the un-
ion decides to provide
2) Improve the quality and consequently

3) Keep union and halls of residence fa-
cilities affordable.
Thanks for reading! Think Deep when
