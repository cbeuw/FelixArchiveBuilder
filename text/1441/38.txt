Tired of being a loser? Here are some
top tips for de-geeking yourself and
‘bringing on the cool!’
Tip 1: NEVER use the phrase ‘bringing
on the cool!’
Tip 2: SKIP LECTURES. Nothing
shouts ‘cool’ louder than outright lazi-
ness. Make sure your absense is noted
by everyone. This may involve turning
up to the end of the lecture and shout-
ing, ‘SORRY I’M LATE. I WAS BUSY
NOT GIVING A SHIT ABOUT THIS
COURSE!’ Then walk straight back out
Tip 3: (FOR THE GUYS) Don’t moan
about the male-to-female ratio. This
does not bother you! You actually came
to Imperial for a challenge. You’re tired
of scoring so much pussy and your dick
needs a holiday. Then look and your
manhood and say, ‘not much of a holi-
day is it boy?’
If you’re too cool to be ‘reading’, here’s a hint... it’s not that hard

Round 1
The X-Factor:
it’s a sadist’s
wet dream
T
W
hen I tell people at Im-
perial that I watch the
X factor, they contort
their faces in disgust
and then ‘tut’ condescendingly. I
sometimes think they’d look less hor-
rified if I told them that I thought that
holocaust didn’t happen (Great ice-
breaker by the way).
You have to remember that most
Imperial students sit on top of the
class pyramid and shout to the com-
moners below, “Dance for me plebians
and sniff my organic shit! That smell
is descended from lords. LORDS!”
There is a strict criteria for middle-
class television viewing; if Jeremy
Paxman or Stephen Fry aren’t on the
credits then it’s working-class. Con-
sidering the fact that Simon Cowell
is neither Jeremy Paxman, or Stephen
Fry, we can conclude that the X-factor
is nothing more than brain-numbing,
blue-collar garbage.
Well, you know what? Fuck you!
Behind the garish and contrived ap-
parel is a dark and sinister feast that
feeds sadistic twats like myself.
I love to watch people fail and that’s
what makes reality TV so enjoyable.
Whilst the neanderthal majority of
the X factor’s viewers clap and drool
over the pretty flashing lights and
Cheryl Cole’s breasts, I lick the tears
of misery right off Rachel’s stupid
face as she gets told, for a second
week running, that no-one likes her.
We’re all bastards really. We take
great pleasure in other’s misfor-
tunes. It’s blissful schadenfreude.
We’ve been told, since the day that
we learnt to point and laugh, that
we should stop staring and keep our
thoughts to ourselves.If staring was
socially acceptable then we’d all be
much happier. No-one likes to force
themselves to turn their eyes away
from the limbless pillow-of-a-man as
he tries to get his wheelchair through
the doors of HMV with nothing but
his chin, but we’ve been conditioned
to accept freakshows in the street as
commonplace.
Well thank God for the X-factor!
The show that’s let us laugh at our re-
jects of society since 2004.

A Beginner’s Guide to
being ‘Cool’ at Imperial
Tip 4: (FOR THE GIRLS) Avoid guys
that talk to their manhood.
Tip 5: (FOR THE GUYS) Join the rug-
by team - the epitome of ‘coolness’. If
catching a ball and running into peo-
ple is your ideal sport, then rugby is for
you! Girls simply love loud obnoxious
oafs with a narrow vocabulary of ‘tits’
and ‘beer’.
Tip 6: (FOR THE GIRLS) Don’t join
the rugby team
Tip 7: Start Smoking. Anything det-
rimental to your health is ‘cool’. This
includes running into walls and AIDS.
Tip 8: Try to subtly divert conversation
towards your Daddy’s annual income.
Example: “So what sort of music are
you into?” “Oh right, yeah, he earns
two and a half million a year”
Tip 9: On a night out, people love to
know if you’re drunk, so make sure
you tell them every fucking minute!
11 reasons why we hate the football team
Then tell them that you love drinking
and that you’re always the life and soul
of the party and that no-one gets as
drunk as you. If they still don’t believe
you, bring a breath-a-liser or blood-
testing kit. They NEED to know that
you’re drunk.
Tip 10: If you’re watching a film in
your common room, or just with a
group of friends, alert them when a
funny bit is coming up. It’s your job to
tell them that it’s funny and prepare
them for the gag. They’ll really appre-
ciate this because they probably would
have missed it otherwise.
Tip 11: Maintain a collection of skin-
tight attire, preferably in a selection
of matt colours. Combine this with
carrying your protein shake in one of
those ultra-cool shakers! Remember to
stretch those calves...
Tip 12: When reading felix, skip
straight to ‘Hangman’, read the first ar-
ticle and never pick up felix again.

A night in with
the girlfriend
8:05 - Shit! She’s here, clear internet
history and throw bedroom mess into
the wardrobe.
8:10 - Let her in, think of excuse for
why you took so long, “Uh I was
taking a dump” NO! Not that!!!
8:12 - Explain that you WOULD
cook but that you just feel like pizza
tonight.
8:13 - Use girlfriend’s debit card to
pay for pizza
8:30 - “Oh yeh that’s really
interesting”, THANK GOD, the
pizza’s here.
8:42 - Head upstairs, quickly use your
finger to clean your teeth.
8:44 - Go through the motions... I
HATE foreplay, it’s just gunk really.
8:55 - YES, penetration! WOOO!
8:55:20 - FAIL. Go downstairs, grab
kitchen knife and kill yourself.
