T
he first ever Freshers’ Festival
Weekender severely strug-
gled to attract the crowds
projected for an event of its
size last weekend.
Even after all entry charges were
waived and drinks were set at Sports
Night prices, the festival held in Beit
Quad came close to being empty at
several points throughout its three day
duration. Original ticket prices were
£15 for all three days of the weekend,
whilst entry to a single day’s proceed-
ings cost £7.50. However, after a poor
turnout on Friday, the first day, the re-
maining two were made free of charge.
The organisers hoped the cheap
drinks would help pull in more peo-
ple, but the £1.50 pints seemed to
do little for the crowd numbers, and
one attendee described the place as
“deserted”.
Despite the impressive line-up, the
Union’s chronic problem of poor stu-
dent turnout to its events lay injury to
weekend festival. Reports on Saturday
and Sunday night approximate a maxi-
mum crowd number of around 140
people.
IC Radio Station Manager and fes-
tival organiser Dan Fowler felt the fes-
tival was a reaction to student’s bore-
dom of previous Union events.
“How many times have you been sat
on the small wall outside DaVinci’s and
over heard some drunken fool moan-
ing that ‘This place only puts on drum
and bass nights?’
Well the aim of this event was to
change that mentality. I’m just looking
through the set timetable now…house,
indie, metal, rock, electro, acoustic,
pop, hip hop/jazz – for me, this aim
was achieved to the highest standard.”
Chew Lips, releasing their material
with Kitsune Records and arguably the
band with the biggest reputation at the
Freshers’ Festival fails to attract Freshers. Or anyone
Just what went wrong? Dan Wan reports on the Freshers’ Festival Weekender 2009 and its miserable turnout
festival, headlined Saturday night in
which was described as the “biggest”
day of the three. Their disappointment
at the small audience was evident and
Fowler himself was let down by the
band’s reaction.
“They have also fallen into the trap of
thinking they are a lot bigger than they
are and so sulked through the entire
performance on the night when seeing
the small crowd. Fair enough, it wasn’t
great, however when you’re being paid
you’ve got no excuses to not just go out
and do what you do best.”
The Freshers’ Festival was the brain-
child of members of ICRadio, Impe-
rial’s budding radio station. With fruit-
ful contacts, and dedicated organisers,
the event looked to be a resounding
success. Impressive initial artwork for
publicity attracted several other socie-
ties at Imperial to give their backing,
including Jazz and Rock, Photo Soc,
felix and especially DramSoc. The fail-
ure to lure in punters comes as a sur-
prise, as the manpower and collabora-
tion behind the weekend should have
meant a packed Beit Quad all weekend.
As part of Union President Ashley
Brown’s manifesto, he pledged that
more live music and entertainment
would happen at the Union; the Fresh-
ers’ Festival certainly provided this. De-
spite being a society organised event,
the Union backed the event financially
and administratively. Three of the ma-
jor acts were said to have been booked
through Union contacts, and money
for advertising and publicity were pro-
vided. The timing of the event could
also have been the root cause of the
weekend’s problems. Occurring only
two weeks into the new academic year
meant the spread of publicity for an
event of its size and duration was limit-
ed on campus and by word-of-mouth.
Posters for the event were only seen
around campus approximately a week
before the event, and this was clearly
not enough time for them to have any
effect on the student population. Mr
Fowler was happy to admit mistakes
were made, but suggested that more of
the blame laid elsewhere.
“Maybe the event started too early,
maybe the pricing was wrong – these
are all lessons that can be learned.
However, if we want a Union to be
proud we need to support it and events
like this which are flagship and trail-
blazing occasions for Imperial.”
Where the blame actually lies will
be debated in the coming weeks, and
the errors made are to be learnt from
if the Freshers’ Festival is set up again
next year.
It comes as a great shame to many
people across the Union; from the soci-
eties involved to the Union’s entertain-
ments team. Both of whom could have
benefited majorly from the boost in
reputation the Freshers’ Festival could
have provided.
Festival-goer and Fresher, Alex Ka-
rapetian, gave his honest and fitting
opinion after initial bewilderment at
the emptiness of the event.
“[The festival] gets 2/5 in my opin-
ion¬ because of the overall sufficiency
of the bands and the good work of the
ICRadio DJs. The greatest limiting fac-
tor here was that we didn’t have any-
where near the amount of people need-
ed to be able to fully enjoy ourselves.”
