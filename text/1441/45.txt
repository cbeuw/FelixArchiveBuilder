Polo in the
Park
By mid June last term, anticipation for
Riding and Polo’s second trip to the
Summer University Polo Nationals
had been building for some time. Our
teams were picked, our entries were in
and everything appeared to be worry-
ingly organised.
Still, after a year or so of polo com-
petitions we were getting used to the,
not so very, organised chaos of the
nationals. We’d ended up with one of
the toughest draws in the division; up
against ULU’s team, one of the two fa-
vourites to win the tournament, and
were on paper the severe underdogs.
Determinedly though we cantered
onto the pitch ready to give everything
to turn the tables and claim a strong
result, but from the first throw in it
was obvious that we were outgunned
and our thoughts quickly turned to
defence. ULU made break after break,
and our initial plans disintegrated into
a frantic but dogged rearguard, taking
every opportunity to spoil ULU’s re-
lentless attack. However, their strong-
est player (who went on to win the
most valuable player award) turned
and got away from us several times
resulting in a respectable 2-0 defeat
against a team that went on to loose on
a tiebreaker in the final.
Spirits undiminished we decided
to head out for dinner at a local pub,

and promptly got lost. However, we
did manage to pick up the last of our
players; a very ill Megan who’d shown
impressive commitment to drive up
from Wales with a pretty violent seem-
ing case of ‘Lamb Flu’. Still, it was a
good thing she made it when she did
as the Beginners were up for their first
chukka at 9am.
The Beginners didn’t seem quite able
to get their heads fully into the game
and Nottingham appeared to have
a narrow advantage throughout the
match and, despite some good breaks
and runs from Imperial, Notts did fi-
nally manage to eek their way over our
line to a narrow 1-0 victory. Cambridge
in their traditional blue shirts cantered
up to the centre line to oppose us and a
scrappy chukka ensued from the word
go.
Neither team seemed able to gain
the advantage and we watched on
with baited breath when each break
was met with solid defence and swift
changes of possession. Each time one
team seemed to get away and head for
goal the other managed to get a stick
down to hook an opponents or put
enough pressure on to cause some oth-
er mistake. When you play, the six and
a half minute matches seem to last so
much longer, but this was the first time
I remember watching time slow down
so much from the sideline and we all
Cool start
for 1st XI
ICUAFC’s 1st XI have begun their
season positive but cautious. After a
hard fought victory against the 2nd XI
both in a friendly and the ULU Premier
League, the team were looking to make
a strong start in BUCS. Brunel 4th XI
were the first opponents (14 October).
A strong footballing university,
Brunel showed their ability to control
the play with excellent awareness and
good passing. Going one-nil down at
half time, Dave ‘Robbo’ Robinson, a
Queen’s Park Rangers coach who also
coaches the 1st and 2nd XI captain,
delivered a resounding team talk along
with captain Mustapher Botchway to
give the gentlemen the belief to get a
result.
The second half started strongly
with IC beginning to show their supe-
rior quality to Brunel. Brilliant passing
from Dion Benincasa and good team-
work from Nathan Ferrol and Leslie
Eshun helped in overcoming the score-
line to go 2-1 up. However, as pandem-
ic in most university football teams,
the pressure got the team and with 7
minutes to go the Brunel left winger
cut inside his opponent and unleashed
a great finish to equalise. The game
ended 2-2.
St Mary’ University 3rd XI were the
second opponents. Though good foot-
ball was played by IC, the lack of at-
tacking prowess rarely troubled the St
Mary’s defence. The pacey winger of
St Mary’s had this spark and created a
goal as well as scoring a wonderful solo
effort in the second half.
IC’s first team are hoping to return
to winning ways and start the game of
strongly in the next week with the next
two games against their biggest exter-
nal and internal rivals: Royal Holloway
and Imperial Medicals.
