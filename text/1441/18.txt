nd so you finally get to meet
me, your third Arts editor.
Sorry its been such a wait
but you can’t see much art
lying on the sofa with flu (possibly of
the swine variety).
Those of you who aren’t still doe-eyed
and fresh-faced may recognise me as
“that girl who reviews all the musicals”.
Yes it is true I am a bit of a fan, but I
like to try other cultural delights as I
hope you all do when not slaving over a
problem sheet or attending another lab
session. Even if you do tend to get stuck
at Imperial there’s plenty of culture
around as I’ve been finding on my pro-
gressively chillier journeys into college.
After a year travelling the same route
I’ve become a little weary and so have
begun to occupy myself by playing
games. Aside from “count the leavers
hoodies” (seriously people, we know
you went to school otherwise you
wouldn’t be here, you don’t need to tell
us) I’ve taken to playing “spot the bue
plaques”. On my journey in I’ve seen
everyone from Dennis Gabor (inventor
of holography) to composer Bela Bar-
tok. This week I was surprised to find
that John Millais and Frances Bacon
both inhabited the same house near
South Ken Station, although not at the
same time obviously. I’d love it if they
had been around at the same time, I can
just imagine them sat smoking pipes in
the living room around a roaring fire.
Millais is telling Bacon to get a back-
bone and suggesting he tries painting
a pleasant landscape whilst Bacon is
criticising Millais’ decision to shag his
critics’ wife. Aww, artistic bliss...
This week we’re concentrating on
theatre, but not of the musical variety.
We’ve been sending our eager report-
ers to review the latest plays to hit
London, and what a bounty to choose
from. As an added bonus, I’ve taken
a look back at this Summer’s cultural
highlights and glimpse at what we’re
expecting this season. Enjoy!

S
o, maybe you’ve never heard of
Trevor Griffiths? Neither had
I, maybe that makes us both
philistines, but maybe not.
Let’s get one thing straight, I am cer-
tainly enough of a cultural ignoramus
not to know whether I ought to know
about Trevor Griffiths.
Anyway: Comedians. It sounds
funny doesn’t it? It is, and it is also a
hell of a lot more than that. A brief
summary sounded somewhat less
exciting I thought; Six men from an
evening class in stand-up do their first
show but find out some “home truths”
in the process. Well maybe.
However you can’t judge a play by its
précis and this piece directed by Sean
Holmes is sweltering under the strain
of making the phrase “home truths”
an understatement. Home truths
doesn’t come close to describing the
bubbling turmoil that is a discussion
of loyalty, craziness, sex, truth and
disillusionment.
The play is in three acts, first and
last being in a classroom and the
middle calling a stage, a stage as the
audience is victim to the debut acts of
the six aspiring comics. This straggling
group of men who all desperately
want to follow their dreams into
professional stand-up have been
under the guidance of Mr Waters
(Matthew Kelly) and tonight they are
being watched to see if they make the
grade. The question is whether they
will stick with the earnest old man and
his direction not to play to sexism and
racism or abandon it to score cheap
laughs.
The play is absolutely dripping
with comedy actors including Reece
Shearsmith from League of Gentlemen
and OMG! Lily Allen’s dad, how
cool(sorry, Keith Allen fans), who both
give excellent performances, but it is
David Dawson who absolutely steals
the show with his amazingly electric
performance of Gethin Price. Dawson’s
energy is terrifying, especially in the
bizarre second act where Gethin, an
angry, honest and bizarre man, does
his first stand-up. It’s freaky, quite
frightening and unlike anything else
in the play. This is the culmination of
the fabulously excruciating and funny
second act, and displays Dawson’s
mind-blowing energy and expression,
guaranteed to send the audience out
bewildered into the second interval.
After the amusing and more
predictable first act, full of cute
character detail and ever-so-slightly
uninspiring comedic philosophy, and
left aghast by the second, the third
scene does not disappoint. Revelations
come tumbling out and cut deeper
than they had, tensions run high and
Keith Allen shows off. Some “home
truths” are regrettably left hanging, but
the themes which started off tame and
dry find their full meaning in dialogue
between Dawson and Kelly. The young
and old men argue and Dawson’s
stellar acting drives home justification
for the whole play. Ending with a good
laugh, it really is a funny play but that’s
not the point, it’s about why you laugh.
You should see it because although it’s
not hilarious it is exhilarating.
OMG! Lily Allen’s dad in a play!

I
n a vague attempt to relive the
past few months where the sun
would occasionally shine, ex-
ams were a distant memory and
most of us attempted to make as much
money in as short a time as possible,
we take a look back at this Summers’
culture.
The big news in the arts world
was Anthony Gormley’s “One and
Other” project on the fourth plinth
of Trafalgar Square. Gormley’s aim
was to allow a different person to do
whatever they liked for an hour at a
time- as long as it was legal.
The result was lots of people
standing still in the name of charity
and lots of people getting naked in
the name of being a bit of an idiot. A
friend of mine was one of the lucky
2460 to be selected and got to spend a
dark stormy night throwing glowsticks
to drunken louts; not my idea of a fun
night out.
The other big event for culture
vultures was the Edinburgh Fringe,
this year hosting everything from
Dramsoc’s own production of “Crave”
to an audience with “that guy what
stopped terrorists bombing Glasgow
Airport” (I kid you not). This inevitably
lead to a barrage of plays arriving in
various London fringe venues- look
out for these as they provide a large
amount of the new writing coming to
the capital.
In other theatre news, “Too Close
To The Sun” opened and then closed
a week or two later. Sorry, but who
thought that a four person with no star
names about the last hallucinogenic
days of Ernest Hemingway would
survive in the summer season in a
recession?
In stunt casting news (yes, its
so commonplace it gets its own
news section) - John Barrowman,
everybody’s favourite gay, is currently
dragging up to play Zsa Zsa in La
Cage Aux Folles. Phil Jupitus will also
be partaking in a spot of women’s’
clothing as the latest Edna Turnblad in
Hairspray.
Forbidden Broadway took to
lampooning such behaviour in their
show at the Menier Chocolate Factory.
Tackling everything from Andrew
Lloyd Webber to the campness
of Mamma Mia, they basically
highlighted everything I dislike in
theatre, way to go!
A little closer to College the Proms
sneakily ran at the Royal Albert Hall.
Many complained that an evening of
MGM classics was not what the Proms
is about.
I disagree, film music is a great way
to get people into Classical music- I
certainly wouldn’t have listended if
it weren’t for movies. Also, classical
music shouldn’t just be something
from a hundred or more years ago, if
we stop recognising classics what will
we play our children?
So what was the cultural highlight
of my Summer? A little gem of a show
up in Highgate Village by the name of
Zanna Don’t. A fun, poppy show but
with really deep emotion and a huge
heart, it was Fringe theatre at its best-
go Google it!
And so to this year, what can we
expect? Well theatre-wise, pickings are
pretty slim as everyone seems anxious
to open in a recession.
Musicals-wise we have Annie Get
Your Gun at the Young Vic starring
Jane Horrocks in the title role and the
Menier Chocolate Factory is offering
Tamsin Outhwaite in Sweet Charity.
Our only West End opening is Legally
Blonde with Sheridan Smith and a
cast of “people off the telly” from 5th
December.
Oops, let us not forget Andrew Lloyd
Webber’s latest cash cow Tomorrow
Never Dies, the sequel to Phantom of
The Opera, I will be aiming to forget it
thanks. Hopefully Santa will bring me
some more musicals in my stocking at
Christmas.
Straight play openings are more
abundant (possibly due to lower
Summertime and the
culture was easy...
running costs and larger target
markets). Big news for me is The Rise
and Fall of Little Voice, not because
of X Factor finalist Diana Vickers but
because of Lesley Sharp and Marc
Warren filling the roles played by
Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine in
the film version.
An Inspector Calls will be filling
the Spring Awakening shaped gap
at the Novello Theatre for a limited
run. I’ve heard good things about
this production although it has been
touring for years so may be a bit tired,
lets hope I’m wrong.
We’ll also be seeing the Broadway
transfer of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, with
Darth Vader himself; James Earl Jones.
The reviews for this weren’t great
and many are wondering why it is
transferring but it is classic storytelling
that will get bums on seats.
