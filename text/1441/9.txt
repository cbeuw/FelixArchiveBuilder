5 star luxury living, cordon bleu ca-
tering – our university is doing great
things but are they imperative for our
student lifestyle? Are we right to feel
ever so slightly put out, sitting two to a
seat in lectures and surviving on a diet
of plain jacket potatoes after scouring
the market for a reasonably priced bite
to eat?
As Imperial College slowly changes
its priorities from providing a first
class education to staying afloat in
this fragile commercial climate, we
must ensure that our views and needs
are not overlooked. If you would like
a representative who casts their vote
with consideration and with the wish-
es of the student body at heart, please
vote for Hannah Short as your council
member for Natural Sciences.
To ensure decisions made about the
union are in the best interest of the stu-
dents an individual who is easy to ap-
proach and talk to but also confident is
required. I believe I possess these qual-
ities and therefore I am running for
the position of student trustee. Having
worked at an accountancy firm, two
investment banks and with a trustee
from Oxfam, I feel that I am well pre-
pared for the technical aspect of the
position too. If elected I will endeavour
too: 1) Continue to be approachable
by attend clubs and societies meetings
in order to understand our needs and
thus direct the union to provide serv-
ices that are needed rather than those
that the union decides to provide. 2)
Improve the quality and consequently
the reputation of the union’s student
events. 3) Keep union and halls of resi-
dence facilities affordable. Thanks for
reading! Think Deep when you vote.
