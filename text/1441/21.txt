A
s he takes the stage, the man
himself proclaims, “you
may know me for drag-
on slaying... but its the
music makes the man,” a perfect
introduction to a sauce inspired
performance.
To the majority of Britons, Levi
roots is the flagship of what the
Dragons Den can do in making
an entrepreneur, But he’s far cry
from a TV chef with a simple
Jingle. Nominated for a MOBO
award in 1998 he was known to
be a close friend of Bob Marley,
He performed with the likes of
James Brown and sung “Happy
Birthday, Mr. president” to Nel-
son Mandela on his trip to the UK in
1992.
Still Levi’s new single, “So out of
my mind” will have a hard time fight-
ing for its right as genuine track rather
than a cookery related gimmick. His
single and performance was a mixture
of energetic self written and reggae
covers, whilst acts such as Damien
Marley might be trying to revamp
the island style for a new genera-
tion Levi is keeping his music firm-
ly to its roots (…sorry)
Without a doubt watching him
perform eradicates any question
that roots is a one trick pony, but
I think it might be a hard sell to
fight for shelf space with a some-
what dated reggae sound. As the
final song comes round however
and the scantily clad women take
to the already crowded stage, I re-
alize that with this man, you can
never be so sure.
T
yson Ritter, lead singer of
the All American Rejects,
is like no front man I have
ever seen. In all my years of
attending anything from small local
gigs to sell out stadium concerts I have
never witnessed a singer quite as en-
trancing, unpredictable and, let’s face
it, downright weird as Mr Ritter.
Not exactly what you would call a
devoted fan of the Rejects, I was cu-
rious to see how their hits translated
from record into the live atmosphere,
as well as get a chance to hear their
lesser known work. Songs like ‘Give
You Hell’(a Top 20 hit in the UK singles
chart), ‘I Wanna’
, & ‘Dirty Little Secret’
had all of Shepherd’s Bush Empire danc-
ing, whilst the ballads kept every mem-
ber of the audience captivated by Tyson’s
surprisingly pure and powerful vocals.
But more entertaining than their
music by far were Tyson’s on stage an-
tics, which ranged from crawling onto
the stage on all fours Gollum style, to
screaming ‘PULL MY HAIR B****’ at
an unsuspecting blonde female fan.
There was not a dull moment to the
set, because he wouldn’t let there be.
Though not a band that will ever

make it onto my top 5, I’ll hand it to
the Rejects that when they get it right
then they are one of the better bands
of their genre. But that’s just it, they
might be great at what they do, but
what they do (primarily poprock with
more than a touch of the E word) just
isn’t that great.
I
t’s blindingly obvious, the lead
singer and songwriter of Neutral
Milk Hotel, Jeff Mangum, is men-
tally unstable. He hails from the
remote town of Ruston, LA and has
a slightly disturbing obsession with
Anne Frank.
He is a recluse and the last time the
world heard from him, he asked eve-
ryone to help him save an antiquated
merry go round in Massachusetts.
But as per the cliché, as well as be-
ing mentally fragile he is also a bona
fide musical genius, which results in a
highly interesting album. It’s like a dis-
turbed child creating brilliant art out of
road-kill.
The band described their sound as
“fuzz-folk” fusing their earlier sounds
as a noise rock band with simplistic
melodies and acoustic guitar chords,
but this album wasn’t brilliant be-
cause of its genre splicing, it’s the
emotive level the band bring to the
table. The album jerks you through
countless feelings; euphoric happi-
ness then hopeless loneliness then
desolate depression, all while showing
you the full state of Jeff Mangum’s dis-
turbed psyche.
The 8 minute long “O Comely”
starts with a simple strummed mi-
nor chord, with cryptically troubled
lyrics; ‘Oh comely, I will be with you
Albums that you should know
when you lose your breath/With some
pretty, bright and bubbly terrible
scene/ That was doing her thing on
your chest,’ it continues to twist and
turn through Mangum’s demented
scenes, but occasionally he shows you
a glimpse into his rational mind, re-
vealing the true meanings of his lyrics,
before falling back into his obsession
with the plights of Anne Frank. His
lyrics make you feel that you’re in the
psychiatrist’s chair, but the perfect de-
livery of his fanatical ideas will make
you question your own sanity. ‘And
will she [Anne Frank] remember me
fifty years later?/ I wished I could save
her in some sort of time machine’…

will start to seem pretty valid, all
things considered.
As you may have guessed this al-
bum isn’t easy listening, it’s so visceral
as to be uncomfortable at times, but
it all comes from such a raw place
that trying to understand it becomes
unbelievably rewarding. It is hard to
compare this album to any other, as
it is unique and isolated from any-
thing happening at the time, but it
set a precedent for bands like Bright
Eyes and the Arcade Fire who brought
emotionally laden folk music into the
21st century mainstream, and I am
betting that they are hoping for a new
Neutral Milk Hotel album as much as
I am.
