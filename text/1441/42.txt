my control. I seem to be unable to
have intercourse, without letting
out ear-piercing, glass shattering
queefs. There are certain positions
that seem to cause me to queef more
loudly than others. And it was very
shocking the first time I did it. They
keep coming out, and even while he
is going down on me IN HIS FACE!
He has been good about them, as
he laughs, but it dispels the mood.
It just becomes comical, and I don’t
feel sexy anymore. But I get really
embarrassed, because they are really
loud, sound amazingly like farts, and
are totally uncontrollable. Some-
times we just ignore them. Is there
any solution?

Aunty McPickle, your very own agony aunt, is very
happy to answer any questions. But not yours.
Dear Aunty Mc Pickle,
I wanted to know what your thoughts
are about the way I masturbate.
What I like to do with my foreskin
is inflate it. If you don’t know what
I mean by inflate, the foreskin can
be filled with air or liquid, making
it stretch and become a small bal-
loon. The way that best satisfies me
is when I use any source of a high
pressure jet of water.
What I sometimes do is place my
foreskin in front of a pool jet,
which causes it to quickly balloon
and become very full and arousing.
Sometimes I think I might make it
explode. I sometimes use air com-
pressors too, but they can be dan-
gerous if the air leaks up the urethra.
The last way is with a shower head,
the jet of water is strong enough to
tightly pack the foreskin with water,
then I let the stream hit the bloated
foreskin, it feels awfully great.
Is this normal and more importantly
is this healthy?
An adventurous Andy,
Dear Andy,
It sounds like your experimenting is
paying off, but just be careful you don’t
go too far. I once heard a story about a
poor guy, having sex for the first time
and his foreskin exploded! This unfor-
tunate accident just goes to show that
the foreskin is no toy! Also be wary of
infections, as nasties can get trapped
in there. Oh and I really wouldn’t tell
any prospective girlfriends about your
tinkering, it might seem a little strange.
Yours, Aunty McPickle xxx
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I am a fresher and am spending the
year in Wilson House. One night
last week, after a particularly heavy
night, I decided to have a shower to
keep myself fresh. However to my
great dismay I accidently mistook an
innocent fart for something far more
sinister. I realised my error by the
audible sound of it crashing to the
ground. Since then, I have tried to
block out this humiliating memory
but am reminded by a conspicuous
brown stain. It’s ridiculously stub-
born and is now being noticed by my
neighbours. What should I do?
Will Meldred
Hi Will,
Okay, so I think you should invest in
some cleaning products and make your
way to the stain in the dead of night. It
has to be removable and if not, maybe
you should just accept it. I’m sure your
neighbours will become accustomed to
it soon and it can serve as a friendly re-
minder of a night out. Also be careful to
not blurt the story out in the Union, as
this kind of thing spreads like wild fire.

Dear Aunty Mc Pickle,
I need to confess a bodily function,
which appears to be totally out of
Dear Sandy,
Oh dear... a queef is caused by air that
is forced up into the vagina through
hard and rigorous thrusting.
The position that tends to cause opti-
mum queefing is the missionary posi-
tion, so maybe try to avoid this. Also if
the vagina is really wet, it can produce
more queefs so try to cut down on lube.
Also maybe you could put on some re-
ally loud music in an attempt to mask
the sounds.
Hope this helps.

W
ow, I can’t wait to grad-
uate! No, not because
I want to leave Impe-
rial behind, but rather
because Commemoration Day looks
mental. This year, RAG manned the
cloakrooms on top of giving our tra-
ditional Queen’s Tower tours. It was a
wonderful day, and what I found im-
mense was how many freshers came to
help out! A big thank you to everyone
who took time off to help!
On another point, I bear good news,
everyone! Due to the immensely positive
feedback we got from the LOST event,
we’ll be extending the sign-ups for an ex-
tra week! That means that if you didn’t
get a chance to sign-up this week, don’t
worry, there’s still time. We will however
only have a restricted number of places
on the bus (which will be the biggest one
we can book), so make sure to meet us at
the JCR, 13:00-14:00 anytime next week
(26th-30th October).
For anyone who has no idea what I’m
talking about, LOST is RAG’s first major
event of the year. It can be summed up
quite nicely:
1. You get put on a bus, blindfolded.
2. Yougetdriventoamysterylocation.
3. You make your way back to the Un-
ion, without spending ANY money.
There’s really not much more to it!
The teams will be groups of either two
or three, with at least one guy in each
team. All this is happening on Satur-
day, 28th November, which happens to
coincide with a massive Union night,
during which everyone can share their
adventures.
Did I mention that there are prizes?
No? Well the person who raises the most
RAG climbs the Queen’s Tower
money, the person or team wearingq the
wackiest costume, as well as the team
that takes the craziest mode of transpor-
tation will get some great rewards.
Anyway to find out more, make sure
you drop by the JCR at lunchtime next
week, and if you feel like getting LOST
for our chosen charity Barnardos is
something you’d be up for, swing by with
your team.
