Goodbye Vista, hello 7
Microsoft launches its latest and greatest hope to unseat XP from
your desktop but will it succeed? Simon Worthington reports
Vista Be Gone!
W
ell you could be for-
given for thinking this
is a Windows week with
Microsoft launching
the much heralded Windows 7 onto
the unsuspecting public. Us Brits even
managed to get it early for a change,
due to the bloody postal strikes. Si-
mon’s got a great article for you on that
to your left along with a down right
fantastic deal for students.
Microsoft also had some leaks of
the mobile variety this week. After the
decidedly lackluster launch of Win-
dows Mobile 6.5, some leaked mock-
up comparison shots of WM6.5 and 7
surfaced. Instead of the same old ‘Win-
dows 95’ style interface we’ve come to
expect, WM7 looked downright touch
friendly. Microsoft best be pushing
hard to get the seventh iteration of
its mobile operating system out of the
door asap, otherwise it might just find
that the market space it once had has
been swallowed up by Android.
Apple of course couldn’t let Micro-
soft take all the limelight this week, en-
tering the press with a refresh of their
consumer level computers. First up we
had a ‘new’ iMac, which to be hon-
est isn’t all that new except for bigger
screens and some Core i7 love. What
Apple thinks it’s playing at with no Blu-
Ray support in a $2000 machine is any-
one’s guess.
The little brother of the Mac world
also got some love with a spec bump
and the release of a Mac Mini Server,
which is something people have been
using Mac Mini’s for, ever since they
first released them. The white poly-
carbonate MacBook also got a kick in
the pants with bumped specs, an in-
tegrated ‘7 hour’ battery and an LED
backlight. Why anyone would buy one
of these over the marginally more ex-
pensive 13” MacBook Pro is beyond
me, but I guess there must be some.
After a suit from the owners of the
Mighty Mouse patent, Apple went
ahead and changed their whole mouse
design concept. The Magic Mouse,
yet another crappy name, dispenses
with things like buttons and scroll
wheels/balls and moves everything to
multi-touch. Normal mousing is still
performed by moving the thing, but
scrolling and clicking are done through
the touch sensitive surface. Ok, the
Mighty Mouse wasn’t a great mouse
for any extended use but is this thing
any better? It doesn’t even feature re-
chargeable batteries. I guess well have
to see what the public’s reaction to it is.
Finland this week pushed forward a
law to make broadband internet access
a human right. What this will mean for
the whole ‘disconnect the file sharers’
movement to tackle piracy is anyone’s
guess. For more on the subject Feroz
has got a spiffing article for you over
on the right.
Also this week Ben, our very own
felix photographer, takes a look at the
new drool worthy Canon 1D Mk VI,
a must read for anyone interested in
DSLRs. The 1D is something that most
of us wish we could buy but simply
can’t afford it. If however you’re the
kind of person with an enormous trust
fund and a penchant for photography,
hit me up at the usual address.

Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
This week Spotify announced a deal
with 3 to bundle it’s music subscrip-
tion service in with mobile phone con-
tracts. In a move that essentially locks
customers into a two year subscription
with Spotify, 3 users will get all you
can eat music in a similar fashion to
what Spotify has made available on the
desktop. Spotify is not the first to offer
music subscriptions as part of a mobile
phone contract. Both Vodafone and
Nokia have similar services, but Spoti-
fy’s brand for music and availability on
the desktop might make this a winner.
Spotify is also looking to push the serv-
ice out to many platforms and carriers
after starting with the UK’s most open-
minded network 3.
More mobile news this week from
Samsung who introduced the Samsung
Blue ‘eco-phone’. The outer shell of the
not unattractive handset is made from
recycled plastic bottles. Shame about
all that silicon and metals in the circuit
boards but it’s a start right?
DVD-Jon is back again this week with
an update to his iTunes replacement
DoubleTwist. The update re-enables
iPhone syncing, which, with the recent
announcement that DoubleTwist is
going to get an Amazon MP3 store in-
tegration, makes it a worthy competi-
tor to, what at least on Windows, is a
rather unwieldy piece of software.
unsuspecting users without even a lit-
tle bit of warning, resulting in Firefox
blocking the plugin assuming it was
malware. Microsoft threw up a hissy-
fit when Google announced Chrome
Frame an add in for IE saying it was a
security risk yet they do the exact same
thing to your Firefox installation.
Microsoft’s Hotmail was also in
the spotlight this week for blacklist-
ing the NHS for 7 days. For the sec-
ond time addresses ending in nhs.uk
were blocked by Microsoft resulting
in many patients and candidates fail-
ing to receive important emails and
documents. As the world’s third larg-
est employer, the NHS has a lot of ad-
dresses, which play an important role
in both patient care and administra-
tion. If you haven’t already, maybe it’s
time to make something else other
than the aging Hotmail your primary
email account.
The WiFi alliance this week an-
nounced the WiFi Direct certification
, which in effect replicates the direct
connection facility that BlueTooth al-
ready provides but with much higher
bandwidths. Think of it as a beefed up
ad-hoc wireless profile with easier and
faster direct connections between de-
vices. What this will mean for the up
and coming BT 3.0 standard is any-
one’s guess, but for now, low power
devices that use BT are unlikely to be
A
s you read these very words,
a digital revolution is oc-
curring. All over the world,
people young and old are
waking up to a new era of user-centric-
ity and unparalleled performance. Ok,
ok, before this turns into a nauseating
torrent of Microsoft marketing babble
(or even worse, another Launch Party
video) let’s cut to the chase: Windows
7 is here, so let’s get the lowdown on
what it means for me and you.
To the untrained eye, Windows 7
will, for many people, be very remi-
niscent of Vista. There are still lots of
shiny Aero Glass and transparency ef-
fects, and the core features like Win-
dows Explorer and the Start menu
remain mainly unchanged. However,
there have been numerous more sub-
tle changes that could take people a
little while to get used to. The first is
the new taskbar which is pretty much
a complete rip-off of Apple’s dock.
It uses big, glossy icons to represent
programs instead of the little rectan-
gles we’re used to. It does this regard-
less of whether or not they’re open or
not, providing a place to ‘pin’ favourite
programs in place of the now-removed
Quick Launch bar. They’ve also added
several new features under the “Win-
dows Aero” banner, including the abil-
ity to snap windows to the edges of the
screen and a big button to briefly hide
all the Windows to see what’s on the
desktop. All of this is shuffling around
the features we’ve all actually had for
ages, but presenting them in a fresh
and more user-friendly way.
Windows 7 isn’t just an old dog with
new tricks however, the majority of
changes that those crazy Microsoft de-
velopers have put into the new version
have been under the hood, providing
a myriad of performance-related im-
provements. In benchmark tests on the
Windows 7 release candidate it con-
sistently out-performs Vista at pretty
much everything, and in some cases it
even does better than XP. It is usable
sooner on boot, shuts down quicker
and uses fewer system resources. In
fact it does everything you’ve always
been able to do (and more) and it’s had
a bit of liposuction to boot. A lot of
commentators suspect that Windows
7 will quickly become the platform of
choice for hardcore PC gamers instead
of XP, finally delivering the goods to
elitists where Vista so sluggishly failed.
This isn’t just good news for those of
us with beefy tower computers though.
Windows 7 has also been designed
with laptops, netbooks and tablets in
mind, so anyone upgrading should see
a considerable performance increase
on lower-end systems over Vista. It
may not even matter if your laptop is
a few years out of date, as the system
requirements for Windows 7 have
only changed very slightly since Vista,
requiring only slightly more memory
and a very slightly faster processor.
The graphics requirements remain un-
changed and the amount of disk space
you’ll need has in fact dropped by sev-
eral gigabytes. Performance increases
like this could breathe a new lease of
life into old laptops and save the user
quite a bit of money as previously
bumbling hardware gains a spring in
its step from Windows 7.
Speaking of money, you’d expect to
have to pay through the nose for the
new version as is usual with new Mi-
crosoft releases. If you were anyone
but a student you’d be right, with the
retail Ultimate edition of Windows 7
weighing in at a whopping £299.99.
There is a way for students to get it for
considerably less however, and I’m not
talking about BitTorrent. Everyone
with an “ac.uk” email address (that’s
everyone at Imperial) can take advan-
tage of the “Ultimate Steal” offer which
allows us to get the Home Premium
version for the low, low price of £30.

Windows 7 is set to become the new
operating system of the moment for
the PC world. Whether you’re ready or
not, odd’s are that it’ll start appearing
on Imperial computers in the future,
so even though there are a few changes
that might take a while to get used to,
in the long run, making the jump is
something that is inevitable.

go where the Street View cars can’t and
photograph even more of the country.
Mind you, the Trike riders better keep
their wits about them, riding around
with thousands of pounds worth of
camera equipment attached.
WolframAlpha, the computational
engine, released an iPhone app this
week. How much for the convenience
of not going to the iPhone optimised
site? An extortionate £30! I say thanks
but no thanks. The only useful thing
I’ve managed to get out of WolframAl-
pha has been the amount of vitamin C
contained in a lightyear3
of strawber-
ries. OK, not that useful.
Dell unleashed the new, anorexic
Adamo XPS to the world this week co-
inciding with the Windows 7 launch.
Measuring in at a positively wafer like
0.39” thick and using a ‘heat-sensing
strip’ to automatically open the lid, this
epitome of indulgence can be had for a
cool $2000. Just don’t expect it to en-
code that YouTube video of you farting
in your mates face whilst he’s passed
out drunk in HD too quick OK?
Being a Windows week, Micro-
soft couldn’t get everything right and
in this case had its grimy mitts on
Firefox. The Windows Presentation
Foundation plugin was pushed upon
upgraded with WiFi Direct.
This week, Google announced the
Street View Trike, showing that there’s
nowhere to hide from Street View.
