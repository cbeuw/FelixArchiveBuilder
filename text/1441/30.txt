Who cares about 3-D?
I want a 1D MkVI
This week, Canon announced their
new flagship DSLR, an update to the
infamous 1D, the EOS-1D Mark IV.
Sporting a 16.1MP APS-H CMOS
sensor (a departure from the previous
1D’s full frame) capable of 10fps and
backed up with the latest Dual DIGIC
4 processing engines. Canon is aim-
ing its latest and greatest squarely at
the demanding sport, journalism and
paparazzi (aka the professional stalker
market).
Headline features include a whop-
ping ISO 102,400 (making stalking
possible in complete darkness), Full
HD 1080p movie mode (so you can
capture your victim’s movements in
crystal clear HD), 100% frame cover-
age (a feature shared by the new EOS-
7D) and a new 45-point TTL autofo-
cus. The package is as with all previous
1Ds, encased in Canon’s pro-standard
rubber-sealed magnesium alloy body,
which means it can take a knock or two
and won’t crumple into a mess when
it gets knocked out of your hands by
some pissed off celebrity/footballer/
ex-girlfriend.
Building on the 1D’s three previous
iterations (and their s and N variants),
Canon have listened to the cries of
the pro photographer. The result is a
the new AF system (with 39 of the 45
points being cross type at f/2.8), full
feature customization, the ability to
add copyright data to images straight
out of the camera and Canon’s new
spot AF feature – a precise pinpoint
focus mechanism.
Following the 1D’s generational slim-
ming program the Mk IV weighs in at
a svelte 1.1kg, which compared to the
Mk I at 1.6kg is a marked improve-
ment. The 1D Mk VI also bests its cur-
rent competition from Nikon, the flag-
ship D3s, which weighs 1.2kg. Canon
has also made some subtle ergonomic
changes which should improve an al-
ready excellent grip with the proven
‘elephant’s arse effect’ texture cover-
ing the main portion of the vertical
and horizontal grips making even the
sweatiest palms stick to it like glue.
From an aesthetic point of view the
only thing that could be a miss is the
fact that without the rather small ‘Mark
IV’ text you’d struggle to tell it apart
from the Mk III, but in this photog-
rapher’s opinion that’s not such a bad
thing. An interesting feature is the abil-
ity to configure the Autofocus points
separately for landscape and portrait
orientations allowing for super-fast
framing switching, which should cater
well to those suffering from paranoid
composure indecisiveness.
In line with most other recent
DSLRs, the Mk IV supports full HD
1080p recording at 30, 25 and cinemat-
ic 24fps along with 720p at 60 and 50
fps. As we’ve seen in the past HD video
shot with the kind of quality lens that’s
often attached to a DSLR really stands
out from even the better consumer
HD video cameras. Canon have also
given the user full manual exposure
whilst video recording meaning that
the 1D moves still cameras one step
closer to offering a serious challenge
to dedicated pro video cameras. The
lack of proper autofocus during re-
cording however means that amateurs
will stuggle (and fill YouTube with vid-
eos of out-of-focus pets in a matter
of days), but in the hands of someone
who knows what they’re doing you‘ll
see some really fantastic video come
out of a 1D and it certainly 1-ups the
Nikon D3s.
So if you’ve got a spare four and a
half grand for the body only (yes that’s
£4500) and a passing interest in pho-
tography or fancy yourself an amateur
paparazzi, it might be worth checking
this one out.
Fancy some Nooky?
This week has been a good week for
eBook readers. Barnes & Noble, an
American book store, has taken the
fight to Amazon with it’s newly an-
nounced nook eBook reader. Heralded
as ‘the most advanced eBook reader’
the nook sure does have some stand
out features.
First up it’s packing Android (yes,
you heard right, Google’s open-source
mobile operating system). Whether it’ll
be able to run Android apps is however
not known, but chances are that some
enterprising hacker will put together
something for it even if Barnes & Noble
don’t.
Secondly, it’s got two screens. The
now standard 6” diagonal, 16-lev-
el gray scale, E-ink display, is
backed up rather unusually by
a secondary colour touch-
screen LCD below.
The problem with
eBook readers
such as the
Amazon
Kin-
dle and the
Sony eReader have
been that, quite frankly, their user
interface sucks. The technology behind
E-ink displays which produce high
contrast and low power consumption
also produce a tediously slow refresh
rate. This means that anything mov-
ing like a UI is frustrating to use on
an E-ink display. That’s where Barnes
& Noble hope the nook secondary ca-
pacitive touchscreen comes in. Navi-
gation, selection and all operations are
in theory, a lot easier on a LCD touch-
screen, even if it is just a small strip at
the bottom.
For storage the nook features 2Gb of
memory built in, plus a microSD card
slot for expansion, so there’s plenty of
space for all your books. Competing
directly with Amazon’s Kindle, the
nook has GSM based 3G wireless for
access to the Barnes & Noble book
store for on the go book purchasing
and downloads. WiFi is also available
on the nook although it’ll be limited to
only working in Barnes & Noble stores
on launch. On the bright side Barnes
& Noble will offer book browsing on
the nook inside their brick and mortar
stores ,via WiFi, that will allow you to
‘stream the book’. This will give you ac-
cess to the whole book as long as you
stay in the confines of the store. It’s an
attempt by to replicate the experience
of browsing and buying paper books in
brick and mortar book stores, some-
thing that a lot of readers feel that’s
sorely lacking with eBook readers.
To further simulate the physical book
experience, B&N have built in book
‘lending’, a feature by which you can
lend any LendMe branded book to an-
other
nook
owning
friend. It’s
at the discre-
tion of the pub-
lisher whether this
is enabled on a per
book basis, but Barnes
& Noble are pushing for as
many books as possible to be
part of the service.
Battery life on the nook is rated at
10 days of reading with the wireless off
with a full charge reached in 3.5 hours.
The nook also plays mp3s with a built
in mono speaker or headphones jack.
On the format front, the nook sup-
ports various documents and image
formats including ePub and PDFs. For
a majority of people PDF support will
be a boon especially for those looking
to read text books or papers in digital
format, something Amazon tried to
capture with it’s Kindle DX.
All in all the Barnes & Noble nook
promises to be a major step forward in
eBook reader usability and with a $259
price tag it might even be affordable.
Whether it will make it over to the UK is
anyone’s guess, but with Amazon push-
ing their ‘International’ Kindle in the run
up to Christmas, it wouldn’t be too far
fetched for the nook to follow suit.
“UK placed 25th
out of 66 countries
for broadband”
Broadband internet access to become human right for forward thinking Finns
Last week, Finnish lawmakers passed
a law that entitles all Finnish citizens
to 1Mbps broadband. The law, which
comes into force in July 2010, is part
of a broader Finnish broadband policy
that should eventually see 100 Mbps
internet being a legal right by 2015.
This comes at a time when a growing
number of mainland European coun-
tries have begun classifying internet
access as a human right, meaning that
it is the responsibility of each country’s
government to provide internet access
to all it’s citizens. The situation in the
United Kingdom, however, is rather
dire.
As Imperial students, we are used
to exceptionally fast internet by UK
standards. On a wireless network in
the library, you can get speeds up to 20
Mbps. A wired connection in residenc-
es on the South Kensington campus
reaches speeds of ~95Mbps. Yet the
situation just a block away from cam-
pus is very different. A recent survey
of global broadband quality placed the
UK 25th out of 66 countries surveyed
with UK broadband qualified as ‘meet-
ing the needs for today’ and nothing
more. South Korea, the leader in the
survey, along with other Far East Asian
and Scandinavian countries, is already
promising all it’s citizens 1 Gbps inter-
net by 2012. The Digital Britain Report
2009, presented to Parliament, only
aims to achieve 2 Mbps countrywide
internet by 2012, 500 times slower
than Korea and 50 times slower than
what Finland is aiming for only three
years later.
Broadband accessibility isn’t just
about speeds, however. Basic modern
internet delivery infrastructure hasn’t
been created yet in the UK. Apart from
Virgin who are pioneering their opti-
cal fibre network, all truly futureproof
broadband options in the UK are still
under construction. The situation is
set to improve in the near future, but
there is a long way to go before we
catch up to the likes of South Korea.
profit margins depend upon quick in-
formation transfer. The London stock
exchange is planning a major systems
overhaul to cut transaction times from
2.7 ms to 0.4 ms, which is a good indi-
cator of how important speed is with
respect to technology. Positioning the
UK as a leading country in terms of
broadband proliferation could attract
a sizeable amount of investment. Of
course a useful by-product might be
the next time you move, the wait for
your broadband line might be a lit-
tle less. I’m currently pinching my
neighbour’s WiFi signal while I wait
till BT decides to activate my home
connection.

BT received the go-ahead for it’s new
optical fibre network this March, the
construction of which will only be
completed in 2012. In the meanwhile,
most of the UK remains connected us-
ing traditional copper cable or 3G mo-
bile networks.
Fast and reliable internet access
isn’t just an issue of how fast you can
stream movies. Countries with good
internet infrastructure have been able
to sell themselves to investors whose
“South Korea
promising all
citizens 1 Gbps
internet by 2012 ”
Britain lags behind in the connected
world but will it effect the economy?
