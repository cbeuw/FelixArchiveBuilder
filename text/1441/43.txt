Riding and Polo at Polo Nationals
breathed a sigh of relief when the air
horn went with the score still nil-nil.
The tension was not over though as, in
need of a result, we went to a tiebreak-
er, a race to get the ball from one end of
the pitch to the other between the two
teams. With the crowd in full voice the
two teams set off, level pegging down
the whole pitch, finally though Impe-
rial’s consistent hitting began to show
working well supporting one another
as a team and managing to acceler-
ate away from Cambridge in the sec-
ond half of the pitch to take a narrow
victory.
Not to be outdone, the Novices got
set up for their first chukka of the day;
another grudge match against the Roy-
al Veterinary College. This time round
myself, Rosie and Trish knew we were
against opponents we could dominate
in the chukka and we used every inch
of advantage we could. Muscling our
way towards the goal line we scored
our first, trickling the ball over the line
in a rather uninspiring mêlée of sticks
and ponies’ legs. A few frustrated fouls
from RVC crept in culminating in one
player getting sucked in to a high hook
metres from their goal mouth and
awarding us the option of a spot hit or
a 30 yard penalty. We took the spot hit
without hesitation and calmly put the
ball between the posts with just a slight
jitter of nerves as it went worryingly
close to the near post.
With a satisfying 2-0 win under our
belts, and the Beginners having a good
result too, we were all looking for-
wards to our last Saturday matches.
But perhaps we shouldn’t have been
so eager. Despite playing visibly their
best polo of the tournament so far, the
beginners weren’t able to hang onto St
Andrews and in one of the most physi-
cal matches we’ve ever played the Nov-
ices lost out 1-0 to Nottingham as well.
The good play in both matches left us
with plenty of positives though and we
headed for the Saturday night party in
high spirits. The girls made good use
of the chocolate fountain and the guys
(rather wisely) avoided partaking in
the pole dancing lessons that were be-
ing given to drunken organisers.
Fortunately this year we didn’t have
to be up at 9am on Sunday and so
those of us that were feeling slightly
the worse for wear had plenty of time
to recover before their final chukkas of
the tournament. The Beginners were
up first; the fight for 11th and 12th
place against Royal Holloway. Again
they played some of their best polo
of the tournament, both teams far
more flowing than their initial scrappy
chukkas, but again the hunt for a goal
proved fruitless and a slightly disap-
pointing 0-0 draw and narrow loss on
the tiebreaker.
Conversely it felt like the Novices
were getting even more physical and
fast in their 7th-8th playoff against
Oxford Brookes. After a series of ride-
offs, hooks and big defensive shots
though a slight miscommunication put
Rosie in an impossible 2 on 1 in front
of the goal mouth and despite covering
off one of the opponents she was un-
able to do anything to stop the easy tap
in that put Oxford Brookes 1-0 up. Play
continued from the centre and finally
we looked to be starting to hold our
own, one big hit and we looked to be in
with a break that might turn the tide,
but the air horn ironically chose that
moment to sound and play finished to
the anguished cries of Imperial sup-
porters from the sidelines, wanting to
see the result of the final play.
With only one win a piece and the
hunt for a goal in the beginners coming
up short for the Beginners it wasn’t the
result we had wanted, but we all went
home happy, if rather tired and sun-
burnt and in some cases really rather
sick of sleeping in tents. We’d shown
a lot of improvement since last year
and were now holding our own against
some of the tougher teams in the com-
petition and there are high hopes that
this year, with some fresh blood and
some familiar faces, we might go even
further.
