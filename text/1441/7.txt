James Cox: why I’m in love with the East
9 Lives: is graduation actually a happy occasion?
“It is very often
too extrovert for
an engineering
student like me, I
don’t think I’ll ever
live somewhere... so
much fun”
“When it’s all over,
we’re expected to
celebrate the poor
form of living we
have endured for so
long.”
W
e’re pretty lucky
guys here at Impe-
rial; not only do we
get to gloat at our
mates over the fact
that we’re cleverer than them, we also
get to live in what many people belive
to be the greatest city in the world.
But it is so big, and there is so much
to do, it is rare that we ever manage to
venture beyond Onanon on a Thurs-
day night, or on very special occasions,
Camden. Which is a shame, because
we’re missing out on the most exciting,
vibrant and coolest part of the city: the
East.
I was lucky enough to live in
Shoreditch over the summer. Yep, it
is very often too extrovert for an engi-
neering student like me, I don’t think
I’ll ever live somewhere that is so much
fun – the thing that seems to be exclu-
sively what most of its residents live
for!
I
seem to have been the only
person in the whole of Impe-
rial who does not feel the need
to thrive off the euphoria of
wearing an impressive billowing
Harry-Potter-like-gown.
I have bumped into some old friends
and they actually had a vivid look of in-
credulity on their stunned faces when I
said ‘Yeah, I’m not going to graduation
but I’m going to do some work instead!’
My nerdish traits surprise even myself
sometimes, I am doing a postgraduate
course so I’m not really in need of any
graduation ceremonies at present.
Well, as you can imagine, most peo-
ple thought I was mad for not wanting
to attend my own graduation: ‘why
For a start, bars-wise it’s by far my
favourite place to go out at night. It’s
wealth of colourful individualistic
drinking and partying holes laugh
in the faces of the pathetic corporate
Youngs and Fullers dominated ma-
chines of Paddington and Hammer-
smith. They’re crowded with students,
musicians, fashion designers and all
other kinds of interesting people,
most of the time dancing rather
than sitting and always having
a laugh. Even better are the
ranges of booze: Kick-ass
lagers like Kirin Ichiban
and Birra Morreti are
commonplace, and you
can find some
of the weirdest
ales. And a per-
sonal favourite,
Aspall Cyder
is found pretty
cheap in Catch
aren’t you going?’ was the general
question. Well, the answer to that is
because it’s all a lie! Of course it’s all
a lie! We spend 3-4 years toiling and
complaining and shitting about abso-
lutely everything! Then when it’s all
over, we’re expected to celebrate the
poor form of living we have endured
for so long. Sorry, but the harrowing
experiences of university life, coupled
with that of living at home and still be-
ing made to feel like a child, does not
imprint many happy memories for me.
The second reason for my absence
was because when I bought the tickets
to let the parents into this student ha-
ven we call University, they mentioned
how bored they were when they went
(which super-Hoxton party girl Flor-
ence Welsh seems to enjoy). But this is
nothing compared to the bar interiors
themselves, which range from ornate
- the Commercial Tavern, for exam-
ple, has cov- ered all two
to my older sister’s graduation, subse-
quently making me refund the tickets
feeling wholly un-proud, whilst book-
ing their own tickets for a trip abroad.
Thirdly, I didn’t get the class of de-
gree that I was aiming for. I was close,
but it didn’t happen. So acting like I’m
all happy for something that I feel I
failed at is not something I want to do.
Hence, I shall, once again, be the odd-
ball and act anti-socially, by being the
annoyingly depressive person out of
a crowd of happy smiling people with
flashing cameras and proud parents.
I must say, there was a mellow sad-
ness about today. Perhaps it was be-
cause I felt alienated, and subjected to
incredulous looks the whole day that
floors, in Roman cum Indian and
Moorish mosaics and chandeliers – to
gloriously run down, like the intriguing
pub The Griffin. The Red Lion is basi-
cally some weird-arse living room that
sells Kronenbourg.
The music is fantastic as well. Whilst
there are legions of fancy pansy indie
bands, there are also some pretty
exciting real bands, like Ulterior.
And Old Blue Last, owned by
vice magazine, seems to take
anything from metal to rap.
But a party there doesn’t
just mean impenetrable
underground music;
the classics will al-
ways come
out. And I
don’t mean
Britney, I
mean The
Faces, the
Small Faces,
made my sadness kick in.
On an utterly random note, I made
a complete utter fool of myself on the
tube yesterday. Having tried to act so-
cial, rather than the other people who
looked like the essence of life had been
knocked out of them, I stabbed at a
conversation with a middle aged lady
sitting next to me. She was looking
over a publicising leaflet for some art-
ist called Cecil Collins, and I unfortu-
nately mixed that up in my trying-to-
be-social brain with Cecil Helman. I
spoke suddenly to the woman, saying
how I met the person described on the
leaflet; she looked very interested, but
said that I couldn’t have met him, be-
cause he had been dead for 10 years.
Oh crap.
Then I apologised profusely saying
how I had mixed the artist up with
Cecil Helman, who I was contemplat-
ing whether I had actually met before.
I have just googled him now, and yup-
he’s dead too. To cover up my huge
embarrassment, I enquired after the
artist, and the lady got a bit passion-
ate and started talking about the soul,
something that terrified me a little, I
have no idea why. I was then incredibly
unsocial and returned to my newspa-
per with a grace befitting incivility of
the highest rank.
She said goodbye when she left the
train.
T-Rex, Joy Division, Blur – not always
deep, but soulful.
But the gentrification of Shoreditch
and Hoxton (ShoHo) is a new thing,
and the new funky crowd has not oblit-
erated the armies of settlers that have
lived here for years. And this means
awesome, great value curry houses
(No, not the ones on Brick Lane).
Like Chaat, where you’ll get a genuine
but exceptional meal for under a ten-
ner. And there are loads more like it
in Whitechapel, but get in on the act
quick while they’re still true, because
the Rough Guides and Time Outs are
creeping up on them like leeches.
There’s so much more to say about
why I love the area; the fry ups in the
mornings, the awesome sample sales in
new shops desperate to be cool, booze-
ing in Victoria Park in the sun. But the
best advice I can give is to go there. Go
there twice, go with your best mates,
make a night of it. You won’t regret it.
