Halo oh-that’s
not-bad-DST
So, I didn’t get a beta invite to APB’s
preview session, which opened last
week. Bit of a pisser, really, as I was
looking forward to seeing the 2010
MMO. I’m fairly certain it’s going to be
a big launch next year; the merging of
the GTA concept with the MMO ideal
has the potential to be huge, as well as
extending our idea of what an MMO
can actually be.
Actually, combined with The Old
Republic, the Star Wars MMO that
claims to be story-led, the year ahead
looks like it could be a landmark one
for online gaming. With APB trans-
forming how we think about competi-
tion, quests and ranking, and TOR us-
ing Bioware’s significant track record
for narrative to try and drag the sin-
gleplayer experience into the online
world, we might finally see the WoW
model breaking up and fading away.
It’d be good, because while games
like Champions Online show that the
basic WoW format has a lot of variety
to give, if we don’t start to innovate
soon there’s a worry we might stagnate
and be stuck like this for another ten
years. WoW is all well and good, but
games like EVE Online show that we’ve
not really begun to explore what online
communities can do when they’re giv-
en a game world to live in.
Talking of potential, I revisited the
archive of the Experimental Gameplay
Project the other day, hoping to catch
up on their back catalogue. It’s still go-
ing strong - the idea is that a bunch
of developers create games, on their
own, in less than seven days. They
pick a theme each month, and release
their efforts as they announce the next
month’s theme. Played World of Goo?
Canabalt? Crayon Physics Deluxe? The
EGP is where it all began.
There’s a fierce sense of creativity
here, in every game submitted. There’s
something about tight deadlines that
gives a sense of freedom to proceed-
ings, and that’s what creates this amaz-
ing idea, realised in a short space of
time so as to expose the idea without
getting it smothered with ‘additional
features’.
It’s exciting to play what they’ve got
on offer there (you can get involved
yourself, too) with some stellar ideas
appearing out of nothing in a very short
space of time. But I can’t help wanting
to get involved myself. Any Felix read-
ers taken part in the project? Any Felix
readers interested in doing so? Get in
touch with us - games.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. I’d love to hear from you.
This week we continue with our re-
view of the decade, have a Batman fa-
ceoff, and more. Enjoy the issue, and if
you got an APB invite - don’t tell me.

Ten Long Years - 2001
A
h, 2001. It was a very good
year (but not, as we shall
see, as good as 2002). We’re
back on the reminiscence
road, tracking our way to the present
day and reflecting on the years that
made us the gamers we are today.
Aww. Ain’t that nice?
Let’s kick off with probably the most
bizarre story of the year - Uri Gel-
ler suing Nintendo. Apparently he
claimed that a Pokemon character was
made to look like him. Wishful think-
ing on his part, I guess.
On the releases front, though, 2001
was a serious year. Red Faction hit the
PlayStation 2 with the promise of de-
structible environments and a new age
of technology in gaming, a promise it
would wait nine years to fulfil properly
in Red Faction: Guerilla.
“Max Payne is such a classic. Maybe
it wouldn’t stand up to today’s stand-
ards but when I first played it, and last
played it, it blew me away.” Owyn says.
“Forget the action - which is im-
mense - it’s all
about the story,
presentation and
atmosphere for
me. It ef-
fortlessly
created an
interesting
and dark
world that
you always
wanted
to know
more
about,
and delve
deeper into.
Love that
game.”
Max Payne
wasn’t the
only hit that
came out of
Rockstar that
year, however.
This was the
year that
a legen-
MaxPayne,GrandTheftAutoIIIandsomegamecalledHalo.Aquiet
year,then-joinusaswecontinueonourtripthroughthelastdecade
dary game series began - again - with
the launch of Grand Theft Auto III.
The game which changed millions of
gamers. Adam, for one:
“GTAIII made me an explorer, in a
way that no previous game could. Blaz-
ing around Liberty City pounding past
stunt jumps and stuffing hidden pack-
ages in my pockets kept me going ‘til I
Max bloody loves my editorials. Look at him. Glued to the page so he is
knew that city better than the real one
I lived in.”
It also sold a metric fucktonne of
games, and secured Rockstar for the
next decade (or two).
It’s a mixed year for the PlayStation 2.
Blockbuster titles like Devil May Cry
hit and become major selling points,
whilst niche, ‘art’ games like Ico sup-
plemented the console’s attack on the
Dreamcast with beauty and superior
design. With Japan receiving Final
Fantasy X (we’d receive it the following
year), it was an extremely good year for
Sony, one of the defining twelve month
periods for the console itself.
What’s interesting, as we look back
at the last ten years, is to watch the
rise of Activision, now part of the larg-
est publisher around, ActiBlizzard. In
2001 Activision purchased Treyarch,
who would later go on to develop the
Call of Duty franchise that was a key
part in their rise to power.
In the latter part of the year, Met-
al Gear Solid 2 and Halo released,
sparking a furious Christmas as the
XBox hits stores. Both MGS2 and
Halo were defining moments for gam-
ers, as the graphical promise of the
next generation began to show in the
big-name games being released. Met-
al Gear Solid 2’s intricately detailed
scenes looked beautifully cinematic
at every turn, while the first-person
emphasis on Halo enhanced the large-
scale sci-fi warfare and made it all the
more visceral.
Halo, in particular, represents for
many the beginning of a whole new
type of gaming - online multiplayer.
XBox LIVE (which at this point was
still 12 months away) was to blow the
PlayStation2 system out of the water
soon after its launch, requiring far less
setup and investment than Sony’s at-
tempt to wring money from the play-
ers. Halo was poised to become an
online hit, serving huge numbers of
players and setting it up for an inevita-
ble sequel a few years later.
The humble Gamecube had a good
Christmas showing, too - Pikmin and
Smash Bros. both made an appear-
ance, although the Gamecube launch
still seems lackluster when compared
to the XBox’s strong showing back in
that year. The Gamecube’s strongest
offerings were still to come, however.
And lest we forget, 2001 was a Peter
Molyneux year. In what was to be his
last cock-up before he finally made Fa-
ble, Black and White was released to
great aplomb in the press, prompting
Andrew to experience the following:
“I bought into the hype for this game
entirely, as well I might, being 13. I
was gleeful as I got my baby giant ape,
astonished at the building-destructo-
phyics, frustrated by the gesture recog-
nition, bemused as to why my creature
was becoming evil and filthy despite
me only teaching him water-giving
miracles, and gave up partway through
the second island because I was bored
as FUCK. Didn’t play it after a week.”
Conan had a different experience,
though, so maybe we’re being too hard
on Pete:
“I find it to be a strangely pleasant
game to play. Almost relaxing. It’s just
a shame the game itself wasn’t up to
much despite all the hype and Black
and White is the one and only case PC
Gamer ever admitted that they had
praised a game far too highly to my
knowledge.”
Then again, it’s pretty difficult to be
too hard on Molyneux.
Next week we visit 2002, and the
birth of online console gaming prop-
er, the defection of Rare, and the best
platformer ever devised finally gets
released. Want to get your thoughts in
