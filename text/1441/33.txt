Get down to Matter and join the masses in dancing like there’s no tomorrow!
What’s next on the list?
O
k guys so Freshers Week
is over and we’ve had a
little bit of time to nurse
the hangover and get
back ‘on it’. And there’s
not that much going on at the Union
at the moment so we’re not quite sure
what to do with ourselves around Lon-
don, right?
You’ve been told about Vodka Island
at Tiger Tiger and OnAnon and no
doubt you’ve all been to Cheapskates
by now, but we can probably do with-
out them most of the time. Don’t get
me wrong, all of those nights (mostly
run by a company called Rough Hill –
check their website if you’re into that
kind of thing) can be a good night out,
except you have to get stupidly drunk
and/or dressed up like an idiot to have
fun and fit in at those places. But Lon-
don has so much more!
I thought I’d put together a few of
my favourite clubs and bars around
London for you to see what you think.
Also, for when you’re just in the mood
to go out but you’re not sure what you
fancy – Time Out London is a brilliant
website for club listings.
Otherwise, check felix every week
and we should have some things to in-
terest you!
KoKo is probably the one club in Cam-
den that everybody has heard of. With
its dramatic, theatre-style interior and
bands playing every week, KoKo can
be a great place to spend your Friday
nights. Although the impression of
grandeur created by the decor can also
be reflected in the drinks prices (and
the taxi price if you can’t handle the bus
home), Club NME is the closest thing
KoKo has to a real ‘student night’. They
have a pretty wide range of live bands
playing at KoKo, although the majority
fit quite nicely into the ‘indie’ bracket.
This Friday 23rd they have Bleach, The
Drums playing as live bands, and they
always have a couple of DJs on after-
wards - this week there’s a DJ set from
Ou Est Le Swimming Pool and Brain-
love Records!
You’ve all finished with Freshers’ Week, and now nobody knows
what to do, right? Wrong. Well, Charlotte Morris does anyway
A blast to the past,
with roller-skates!
3 am on a night bus, your eyelids are
heavy and you are sure you just sat on
some fresh chewing gum conveniently
placed on the seat by the last passen-
ger. It’s been your 3rd night at Tiger Ti-
ger that month and as your best mate
slumps across your chest murmuring
something about On Anon on Thurs-
day you think: “Is this the only nightlife
London has to offer? Terrible music,
vomit inducing drinks deals and sticky
floors, can there be something differ-
ent?” If this has ever run through your
head during a moment of impending
sobriety then let me introduce you to
Renaissance Rooms.
Located in Vauxhall, this club con-
tains a perfectly reconstructed 70’s
style Roller Disco! Leg-warmers and
spandex are a must for this fun and
energetic night out. The interior of the
club is simple with a two tier skate rink
in the centre and two bars lining each
side. The music is naturally Motown,
funk and other 70’s classics mixed
in with some early house and a few
modern chart hits. Don’t worry if this
doesn’t sound like your style though,
once you slip your neon tights into the
skates, you feel immediately transport-
ed back 30 years and you will soon be
showing your skills on the dance floor.
“But I can’t skate!” I hear you scream.
This is not a major problem, roller skat-
ing is similar to ice skating but much
simpler and only after half an hour you
should soon it pick up enough to have
a good time. The protocol on the skat-
ing rink/dance floor is again similar to
Club NME @ KoKo
Mornington Cresent
Fridays, £5, £4 NUS before
midnight
Bite @ Punk
Tottenham Court Road
Fridays, £5, £3 NUS/flyer
Another one of my favourite indie
haunts, Bite at Punk on a Monday
is always good fun. Playing all kinds
of electro-indie and pop, this club is
tucked away just off Oxford Street. The
club itself is quite small (in comparison
to the others I’ve put together on this
page). Drinks prices are fairly reason-
Matter
North Greenwich
Prices vary, usually around
£15
I had never been to the O2 arena, or
the Millenium Dome - far too far
across London for not really anything
interesting. Matter is worth it. Its ac-
tually quite fun to have a stroll along-
side the Thames as the sun comes up at
6am, as you’re on the way to the Tube
station to get the train with those very
disapproving commuters.
They have different events through-
out the year - they even had a Freshers’
event where Faithless did a live set.
The next big thing not to be missed
at matter is Hospitality on 6th Novem-
ber, with acts including High Contrast,
London Elektricity and Beardyman (if
you get a chance to see Beardyman -
he’s awesome, we saw him at Bestival!!).
See their website for more details, but
basically they have the best events for
drum & bass, house and techno. They
run alongside the well-known club
Fabric in organising freshers’ events so
look out for them, especially if you live
in halls!!
able on a Monday night, personally I
wouldn’t like to pay the entry price and
drinks prices for the other nights that
Punk put on!!
This night is run by the same people
who put on a similar night at King’s
College Union, called After Skool
Club. On a Saturday night it’s £7 entry
and supposedly a pretty good night!
I guess you can see from the clubs
I’ve chosen to tell you about, that my
music taste lies between indie-electro
and drum & bass, but don’t let that
put you off. There are plenty of clubs
around London which cater for differ-
ent genres of music. I’ve been to a night
called Voodoo which moves around to
different clubs (when I went it was at
Electrowerks, Angel) and they play
mostly metal, punk and ska - always
a good night out, playing everything
from Alexisonfire to Nine Inch Nails
to The Specials.
And there are plenty of nights out
around Camden that play that kind
of music. Purple Turtle in Camden is
a good one for live music and Under-
world generally plays rock music (albe-
it a bit cheesy) along with some indie
and some metal.
If you’re looking for a particularly
cheap night out, head to Shoreditch,
where places usually allow free entry.
Drinks prices usually compensate for
this but you don’t have to get ‘smashed’.
Clubs to look out for in Shoreditch in-
clude Electricity Showrooms, Hoxton
Pony and T-bar, which are all around
Old Street and Liverpool Street. Most
of these places also finish quite early
(around 1-2am) so, although there
usually is dancing, they probably fall in
the ‘bar’ category as opposed to ‘clubs’.
They’re also generally better to go to
on a weekend!!
There are always the ‘gay nights’ too
- Popstarz at The Den (formerly The
End) and G-A-Y Late, where you can
sing and dance along to all the cheesi-
est pop songs, from Girls Aloud to
Britney!
Ed Knock gets his lycra on and gets rolling
Get involved!
So you’ve read what I’ve got to say, what have you been up to on
your nights out around London? Whether it’s a bar or a club and
you thought it was amazing or pretty rubbish, let us know!!

Roller-disco @ Renaissance
Rooms
Vauxhall
Thursdays, £10, £5 NUS
ice skating and the club operates a one
way system to avoid collisions. Howev-
er the atmosphere is very relaxed and
you mingle at the edge to chat or show
some moves on your skates.
Renaissance Rooms is the perfect place
to go with good friends or maybe take a
girl on a date as opposed to ice skating.
The best news is that on Thursdays
it operates a student night, £5 entry
and free skate hire from 8pm till 12am
(this is a bargain when you consider
how much ice skating costs). Drinks
are standard London prices with few
offers but this is not the place where
you want to get drunk. It’s a safe option
if you still want a good night out but
fancy giving your liver a rest. The Club
is also open on a Friday and Saturday
night, where entry prices rise to £15 but
it stays open till 2am.
I accidently stumbled across Ren-
aissance Rooms with a group of
friends one night whilst desperately
searching for somewhere to go in
Vauxhall. Dressed for a night
out in a fashionable West
End club we looked slightly
out of place amongst the
bright neon attire of fellow
clubbers/skaters. However we
strapped on our wheels and
were soon flying around
the circuit to the rhythms
of The Supremes, If this
still doesn’t sound like
your idea of a good night
out then I will point you in
the direction of one of my
friends who plays rugby
for Saracens and is
what most would
call a ‘Lad’ but even
he was enjoying
the carnage of a
tipsy roller disco.
Renaissance
Rooms is situated
minutes away from
Vauxhall Station and is
easy to get to from any-
where in West London
with Tube links and
many night buses. So
throw off your danc-
ing shoes and put on
your roller skates; then
get your funk on!
