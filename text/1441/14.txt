BNP’s Question Time debut opposed
As the BBC asserts its impartiality, Business Editor Sina Ataherian considers the different motivations behind
the protests against the decision to host the BNP alongside mainstream parties.
O
n Thursday the British
National Party were
hosted on the BBC’s
flagship political panel
programme, Question
Time, for the first time in the show’s
history. As would be expected, large
demonstrations have been planned to
coincide with the episode’s filming.
The protestors wish to criticise the
BBC for its decision to reward the Par-
ty’s success at the European elections
with increased coverage and publicity.
The BBC’s Director-General, Mark
Thompson, has defended the BBC’s
decision by arguing that “It remains
the BBC’s obligation to scrutinise and
hold to account all elected representa-
tives and to do so with due impartial-
ity.” In common with anyone writing a
news article on the BNP, BBC journal-
ists benefit from a generally accepted
right to express their own opinion of
the Party through their reporting. Even
when a sentence is expressed in a way
so as to sound impartial, this is done
in a comical and mocking tone that
would be completely unacceptable if
the news was about almost any other
party.
For this reason protestors concerned
only about the racism issue should
take a chill pill. No one who does not
already support the BNP is going to be
converted by hearing Nick Griffin ex-
plain how the physically- and intellec-
tually-superior indigenous majority is
being colonised by minorities. On the
other hand, almost a million people
did support the Party at the last elec-
tions. It is highly doubtful that most of
these people are genuinely racist and
it is widely acknowledged that many
of them cast their votes purely in pro-
test at the fumbling, expense-claiming,
mainstream parties.
Clearly racism has not been enough
of a barrier to these people opting for
the BNP. Luckily for the rest of us, the
Party itself offers dozens more as yet
under-publicised reasons not to vote
for it. This begs the question of why
presumably well-informed political ac-
tivist types would not want Mr Griffin
to rant before the whole nation against
the evils of respected military Gener-
als, supermarkets, the services sector
of the economy, private property and
so forth. Secret racist sympathies and
cynical attempts to gain popularity by
sitting MPs aside, the motivation for
the political organisers of such protests
is clear.
Fascism was always been known as
a particularly vile creature of the hard
Left. Amazingly, the likes of Hitler
and Mussolini have since then been
increasingly portrayed as ‘far-right’.
A second look at their actual policies
shows that this is nothing more than
the tactic of changing word meanings,
as popularly warned against by George
Orwell. Semantics may not seem to
be on the same level of importance as
the political issues of the day, but this
tactic has been highly successful in the
past. For an especially amazing exam-
ple, think of the word ‘regulation’. It’s
meaning has been turned upside down
in order to reverse the intentions of
the US Constitution’s framers. They
used it unequivocally to mean ‘to keep
regular’ whereas it is now pretty much
thought of as meaning ‘to interfere in
and impede’.
Although it is difficult to know
where on the traditional left-right
spectrum to put policies such as rid-
ding the NHS of its administrative staff
and restarting the war on the IRA, the
BNP still sits squarely to the left of La-
bour. It draws most of its supporters
from the ranks of Old Labour voters
disillusioned with their former Party’s
Blairite drift towards the centre. It es-
pouses policies such as compulsory
worker-share ownership, protection-
ism and the re-nationalisation of great
swathes of the economy.
At first it may appear ironic that the
flyers advertising the protest around
campus mention as their partner or-
ganisation within IC, the Socialist
Worker Student Society, or SWSS (yes,
I checked, that is a real society and yes,
I asked, it is not meant to be satirical).
This may seem almost as laughable
as the idea of putting on a big dem-
onstration against the BNP receiving
publicity. In fact, it is entirely to be
expected. No-one within the political
mainstream can seriously fear Mr Grif-
fin turning the nation racist through
his rational debating skills on Question
Time. The likes of Peter Hain and the
SWSS on the other hand have every
reason to fear the broadcast of most of
their views, sprinkled with some cas-
ual racism that in fairness they clearly
do not share, on national television
through the voice of Nick Griffin.
Review of the week’s business news
Investors are continuing to flee USD
amid growing signals of increased
broad-money inflation. Speculation
that China and oil producers are
reconsidering their commitment to
the world’s reserve currency has been
fuelling the exit. This is leading the
charge into commodities, dragging
them right out of their December
2008 lows. Eyes are strongly focused
on gold, which will need to reach
$2000 before regaining its inflation-
adjusted 1980 peak. Commodity
exporters have seen their currencies
appreciating significantly. Meanwhile,
rising equities are generally not being
accompanied by increasing optimism
as the nominal gains are being put
down to the weakening Dollar. US
Treasuries have remained strong amid
growing suspicions that the Fed may be
buying them up.
The Federal Reserve has decided
that threats to the supposed recovery
trump long-term inflation fears. It has
reduced the target rate for overnight
lending to 0-.25% in response, and
is claiming that this is contributing
to rising demand for US Treasuries,
alongside a flight to “quality.”
Expectations that China will act to
stop the Dollar sliding too far, both
to support its exporters and because
it owns $800 billion, are limiting the
damage of this policy.
Factors counting against the claim
of rising demand for Treasuries in-
clude the weakening USD, the trillion
Dollar deficit and the record US debt.
Suspicions are falling on the Fed be-
ing up to no good, as usual. Instances
of it distorting various securities mar-
kets in the past are well documented.
The incentive to make Treasuries look
more popular is clearly visible. The
Fed’s consideration of political factors
is known to be higher either side of
important nominations, as in this case
for Chairman, Ben Bernanke.
The stakes are now even higher as
support grows for two Congressional
bills that aim to remove restrictions
on the Government Accountability
Office’s ability to audit the Fed. These
bills now both enjoy strong bi-partisan
support, enough to override a presi-
dential veto in the House. Senior Fed
staff have been scrambling to win over
the 75% of Americans who say they are
fed up with the Fed. There now seems
to be a tactical shift from threatening
surging inflation to trying to show that
investors still trust the system. Recent
federal judgements against Fed exemp-
tion from the Freedom of Information
Act may shed some light.
When the Senate Finance Committee
passed the latest version of the
healthcare Bill, it claimed bi-partisan
support after Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine, voted with the Democrats.
Themostcontroversialoftheproposals
have been considered unlikely to pass
ever since August’s townhall meetings
showed where public opinion stands.
The original Bills would probably have
been filibustered by Repubicans and
moderate Democrats. Far from being
a backstabber, Senator Snowe may
have taken one for the team by offering
the Democrats an opportunity to
save face whilst withdrawing most of
their important demands. It is worth
noting that the Committe did not need
Snowe’s vote to get the Bill passed 14-
9. If Senators such as Blanche Lincoln
side with Republicans in the final vote,
Snowe may yet join in fillibustering.
Asset markets continue recent trends What’s the Fed up to now? Demand for Treasuries defies weakness of the Dollar Snowe may not be a traitor
