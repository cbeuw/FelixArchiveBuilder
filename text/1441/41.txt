Cancer
So you joined the
rugby team last
week. Have you been
enjoying smashing
poon? If that means
virtually getting raped
every time you’re in a ruck then I’m happy for
you. Let’s be honest, drinking a pint of vomit
and stripping off at every available moment is
probably not your idea of fun but at least your ‘in’
with the lads.
Virgo
I’m telling you, get
some help. Still haven’t?
Well, I’ll tell you what
happens if you don’t.
You end up taking her
back to your parents’
house, and well, you’re both definitely going inside.
The only decision is now; which bedroom? You
choose your room, because your sister’s a frigid
bitch and doesn’t keep condoms. Not frigid after
tonight. More like a fridge. She’s fat. Fat as.
Gemini
One for the girls: Your
test just turned blue.
Its your own stupid
fault, have you never
heard of moderation?
Just because this is the
first time you’ve ever got any cock doesn’t mean
you have to shag every horny spotty freak here.
Now I don’t want your fucked up offspring add-
ing to this already overcrowded planet so watch
out, I’m coming for you with a coat hanger...
Pisces
After your first sexual
encounter, you feel
rather perky. Bounc-
ing down the road
you take a shortcut
through a graveyard.
Oh you randy twat, wanking is just not good
enough for you anymore is it? Yes, grab that
shovel, dig up a nice fresh corpse and skull fuck
it til the maggots are turned to mash. She was
someone’s granny you twisted cunt.
Leo
This week, you’ll get
so fucking hammered
at a posh do, you end
up pulling your sister.
Why your sister is
there, you have no
idea. But suddenly she reminds you of your mum,
and then your dad, and oh look, you’ve got a hard-
on. At least your children will be normal. Not.
She’s quite fit but she’s still your sister. Sort them
out before Monday, I’m telling you now.
Aries
Everyone knows that
Caligula liked his
sisters a bit too much,
but did you know he
asked his physcian to
cut a vagina in below
his balls? Now where did the kitchen scissors go, a
couple of good thrusts should do it. It’s not work-
ing but you’re loving the blood and pain, oh fuck
it, you can’t have both at the same anyway. Cut
your dick off and ram it up behind. Lovely.
Scorpio
Wow mate, those
clothes are the height of
fashion: shapeless jeans,
a baggy striped hoody
and where the fuck did
you get those shoes? I’ve
seen better footwear on a tramp! Please keep your
oversized rucksack out of my face whilst tramping
around campus with your face in your feet. I hate
your haircut too, did your mummy do it? With a
bowl? in fact, I just hate you.
Libra
Well, your kids
would be mutated,
then mutilated. I’m
sure some fucker
would catch wind of
your brother-sister
parenthood thing, and just take a jackhammer
to your children. So don’t have them in the first
place, would my advice. Mate, go put your dick
into something else. Even if its a a piece of fruit.
Maybe you can have watermelon babies.
Taurus
Today you will smoke
your first spliff. You
naughty naughty
fresher, don’t you
know that marajuana
is illegal? Well now
you’ve broken the law you’re up for anything,
I suggest heroin. It’s a very traditional drug,
enjoyed by Victorians in fact, there’s just one
small side effect - it’s a little bit addictive. No
worse than smoking then, go for it mate!
Capricorn
A batch of rather angry
horoscopes this week
dont ‘cha think? Hey, I
can’t help how the stars
read! Maybe I shouldn’t
have got the astrology
chart from 4chan.com. If you don’t know what
4chan is then I recommend not going there. How-
ever if you have enjoyed reading these then it’s well
worth a visit. Afterwards, we can sit in a corner and
brood about how much we hate everyone. Pint?
Aquarius
Gratz fresher, you
finally popped your
cherry this week, well
you think you did
anyway. Why is there
blood in your shit?
Let’s take a look at this situation: You met her in
a club down in old Soho, her name is Lola, she
has an 8 inch penis shoved up your arse. Don’t
pretend you’re not enjoying it, wipe those tears
away and ask for a fucking reach around.

Sagittarius
I hate your clothes too,
did Topman throw up
on you? I see you strut
around in your skinny
jeans and printed
t-shirts with album
covers on. You like Joy Division? So do I mate
but I don’t feel the need to thrust that fact in
everyone’s face. I want to pull that stupid fringe
off your perfectly styled hair and shove your
winklepickers where the sun don’t shine.
