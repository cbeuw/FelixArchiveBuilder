thusiastic and interested in working for
our faculty and you all ,this year!!So all
I am asking for is your vote, for a better
faculty, and for new ideas to be placed

Elections and manifestos explained for you
H
ardly three weeks into
the new academic year,
Imperial College Union
have opened the first
round of elections for
the year 2009-2010. The Autumn elec-
tions will see the Union Council take
shape in the form of 4 undergradu-
ate representatives for each Faculty
(Engineering, Medicine and Natural
Sciences), 2 GSEPS representatives, 1
GSLSM representative and 1 non-fac-
ulty representative.
An International Officer will be con-
tested in this round of elections too;
the elected student responsible for
welfare and issues relating to the inter-
national community at Imperial.
The Trustee Board is also appointed
by the student body by the way of elec-
tions. It is the overseeing committee
at the top of the Union. Big decisions
may have to be made here, but less
frequently.
Council is one of the most important
committees within the Union as the
decisions made by it affect every stu-
dent on campus. Most importantly, the
Members of the Council are given the
power to vote on decisions brought to
the Council. Giving this power to the
wrong person could potentially have
adverse consequences.
Councillors meet roughly once a
month to discuss the overall direc-
tion the Union is going in. The people
throughout these pages will have to
give their views on this decision as well
as many other important ones.
Below are their manifestos, ready for
Let your voice be heard! As YOUR
representative of Department of En-
gineering in the Union Council, I will
stand up for your opinion.
Basically, the Union Council is the
policy-making body of the union,
where everything starts and mat-
ters. And my point is our department
should receive more money and more
rights, so we can organize more fun
events, have an awesome uni life, and
have even better labs!!
How am I different? I am not afraid of
saying what I want to say—regardless
of what other members of the council
may think at first. I’ve got nothing to
lose for expressing your opinion. How-
ever, if I don’t do it, I will lose myself. I
love engineering way too much to do
bring it down.
So, in order to see a change, in or-
der to see your goals for our depart-
ment become reality, let your voice be
Lawrence Weetman Rikki Norris
Hey everyone, I’m Zahra! So, why
should you vote for me...well for a
start, my vision is to enhance your
experience of studying engineering
at Imperial, and make it a somewhat
more enjoyable experience. Of course,
engineering is by far the hardest sub-
ject (obviously), and we have LOADS
of work to do, but we need to find time
to allow us to have fun. You can be sure
that I will help make your voices heard,
and do my best to try and make sure
that we have more social events.
SO PLEASE VOTE FOR ME!
Hi. I’m Lawrence and I’m a second year
computer scientist. I was an Engineer-
ing Undergraduate Rep for Imperial
College Union Council last year, my
first year at Imperial. I have seen how
things are done, and taken part in de-
bates and voting on important issues
such as the splitting of the DPEW role.
I am heavily involved in the Engineer-
ing Faculty Union (as well as being
CGCA Officer for the Alumni associa-
tion)and will use all of my knowledge
and practice to represent Engineers
properly on Council, as well as keeping
them informed of what is happening
in THEIR student union through the
CGCU student media. I shall hold the
union to account whenever possible,
and ensure that all decisions made will
be of the greatest possible benefit to
students in the Faculty of Engineering
My name is Rikki and I am a third year
Chemical Engineering student. I am
currently the Vice-President (Finance
& Societies) in the City & Guilds Col-
lege Union, as well as a member of the
New Clubs Committee. I also work in
the Student Activities Centre, where I
have good contact with the Sabbaticals
and Union staff. I sat on Council last
year as an Engineering Ordinary Mem-
ber, and was involved with the decision
to split the old Deputy President (Edu-
cation & Welfare). I feel that I should
sit on Council again this year as I am
very experienced in most matters it
covers, and know that it is Council’s
job to hold the Sabbaticals to account-
especially at a time when new posi-
tions exist. You should vote for me to
ensure that someone with experience
is there to represent you, as Engineers,
at Council.

As the City & Guilds Union Represent-
ative I am responsible for voicing the
opinion of our faculty; this includes the
Committees of the C&G but more im-
portantly your voice as a student. I will
help determine policies that you want
on the issues in our union.
I have represented many sections of
our college from Clubs & Societies to
the Halls that we all once lived in and I
now want to represent you.
Vote for me, Edward O Hare.

Councillors
