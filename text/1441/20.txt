We love pop
music
I
got an email from a reader
and I’m not going to name any
names but he introduced him-
self with the amazing line, “i’m a
pop music master, and all thing
pop/rnb/chart i’m the first to know
about :)” [sic]. Pop music master here
suggests that we shouldn’t review pop
music as we clearly all hate pop music
here at the felix, but this isn’t true! I
love pop music.
I like David Bowie, Michael Jackson,
La Roux, Weezer, and so on. We try
to cover a range of different music and
if you want something else in here, go
ahead and write it and send it in.
Someone else I spoke to recently,
when asked what sort of music he lis-
tens to replied that all music is either
classical or pop, and if it isn’t classical,
then it’s just pop music. I think there’s
truth in this, while I love to categorise
and dissect music into boxes, it occurs
to me: there is no definition of pop
music. Pop obviously just stands for
‘popular’, and the music that we think
of as modern pop music really just
means it is music made to be popular,
i.e. to sell records. And this is why I
don’t like the Saturdays. It’s made to
appeal to the most easily manipulated
and easily influenced corner of the
market, the real low-brow, microwave-
dinner eating, George-by-Asda wear-
ing, X-factor voting, Sun reading cre-
tins. Urgh.
So, here are some things I like (yes!
There actually are things I like!), that
I bought recently and recommend
you getting into. ZE 30: ZE Records
Story 1979 – 2009 is a compilation of
artists on the New York record label
that includes an eclectic mix of post-
punk misfits and music ranging from
disco (Material with Nona Hendrix
- Bustin’ out), calypso (Kid Creole &
the Coconuts – something wrong in
paradise), no wave (Suicide – dream
dream baby), and off-beat Jazz weird-
ness (James Chance and the Contor-
tions – roving eye).
Gang Gang Dance – Saint Dymph-
na is an album that came out in 2008
but I only just got round to buying it
recently because the sticker said “Fact
Magazine names it the best album
we’ve heard all year!” and I like Fact
magazine. It’s a weird and twisting mix
of ethereal electronic and worldbeat. I
can only think to describe it as exciting
and magical and weirder than Bjork
and Animal Collective together. The
track “House Jam” is probably one of
the best songs I’ve ever heard.
Girls – Album is lovely, fuzzy, in-
die pop gold. Who can’t relate to
opening lyrics like “Oh I wish I had a
boyfriend/a sun tan/a pizza/a bottle of
wine”? I love the whole album. The
lead singer was brought up in the Chil-
dren Of God cult, where his brother
died due to lack of medical care and his
mum became a prostitute. He left at
the age of 16 and ran away to become
a stoner in Texas living with million-
aires. Woah, that’s pretty crazy.

Reviews
The electronic beats on Autokratz’s de-
but album, are fairly repetitive and get
on your nerves after a while. But the
vocals by David make the songs ever so
slightly catchy and are strong enough
to get you dancing along. Similar to
Hot Chip this is music you might listen
to, to get into the party mood. - Holly

This is some kind of acoustic punk/
emo. I’ve just listened to it and I’ve
already forgotten what it sounds like.
I think it was alright. If you like folk
punk sort of stuff you could do worse
than this.- Alex Ashford

Funeral for a Friend
Koko, Camden
14th October
★★★★✩
F
or most people, the name “Fu-
neral for a Friend” evokes the
term “emo”; perhaps a rather
glum association. I too had
dismissed them as bland fad-followers
before a chance run-in with their debut
album, Casually Dressed and Deep in
Conversation, and I would encourage
wary listeners to shed their prejudices
too – you might be pleasantly surprised.
Despite the fact that Wednesday’s
gig was on Matt Davies-Kreye’s (vo-
cals) birthday, their current tour itself
is something of a celebration for the
band. They just released a best of al-
bum, and a sense of awe at the act’s
survival over seven-and-a-half years
was conveyed in the birthday boy’s
light-hearted between-song banter.
KOKO was sold out and the rapport
between the band and audience was
strong yet relaxed, almost relieved.
This couldn’t be said for the support
acts, Telegraphs (emo-tinged “alter-
native rock”) and Save Your Breath
(emo-tinged pop punk), whose good
sets to a floor, mostly empty thanks to
six wasted manly men and one men-
tal (and more than inebriated) scene
girl. Thankfully, the fervent crowd
swamped their disruptions well before
the main act came on.
For this tour the band allowed fans to
vote for their favourite songs and from
the results they created their setlists.
This meant that everyone’s dream
selection was played, and the energy
didn’t let up for a minute. By far the
largest track contribution came from
their first album with choice cuts from
all three others, including the moving
“History” and grandiose though slight-
ly sickly “Into Oblivion (Reunion)”.
One of the band’s greatest strengths
is their talent for writing gargantuan
choruses, a force only magnified live.
Davies-Kreye hardly needed to sing
his own songs, and even Kris Coombs-
Roberts and Darran Smith’s intensely
melodic guitar hooks were overcome
by the crowd’s voice at times. For my-
self, I didn’t realise how far forward I
had moved until the lights went up,
and my voice hurt from trying to sing
over all the other fans. My only com-
plaint would be that obligatory closer
“Juneau”, felt almost anticlimactic after
Funeral’s voted-for gigs a winner
Eliot Barford drops his prejudices and gets a bit emotional
This song is about three minutes too
long. The whole thing just reminds
me of the sloppy shit I took the other
day when I ate too much lentil curry.
They’re touring with The Enemy, so if
you like them this’ll be a wet dream for
you. - Barnaby Walker

Hed Kandi claim that ‘Destroy the
Disco’ is “reaching into the future”.
It’s quite a lofty claim, and one that
this 2-CD mix falls far short of, but I
wouldn’t hold that against it. The first
CD is full of remixes that you can see
coming from a mile away. There’s a re-
worked track by Gossip, one by Block
Party and one by Calvin Harris – you
get the picture. CD2 is less packed with
predictable remixes, but still offers lit-
tle respite from the formulaic bass-
heavy electro clichés.
Although there are a few highlights,
including a remix from Kissy Sell Out
that transforms a Noisettes track into
an absolute leviathan, overall there’s
nothing that stands out here really. For
a mix that runs the length of two CDs,
it’s not really worth the time it takes to
listen to it. You’re much better off just
investing in a Fabriclive mix – they’re a
lot more original, and don’t make you
feel like you’ve been listening to the
same track for the past hour.

ALBUM
The new double A-side from grunge
veterans Pearl Jam is a brilliant dem-
onstration of strength in depth: Got
Some’s classic rock and roll feel con-
trasts beautifully with the delicate,
wistful orchestral manoeuvres of Just
Breathe to show a band once more
approaching the top of their game. A
tighter, more disciplined effort than a
number of their recent releases, Got
Some alludes to the McCarthyism of
the tail end of the Bush maladministra-
tion; Just Breathe is a quietly moving
romantic masterpiece on the acoustic
guitar and Hammond organ, leaning in
places on the acoustic folk of the early
‘70s.
It’s long been accepted that Pearl
Jam would have eclipsed Nirvana com-
pletely had Eddie Vedder taken the
sensible career move of developing a
heroin addiction and topping himself.
As the band’s sound continues to de-
velop, though, I find myself more and
more glad he didn’t.

This guy looks a lot like Moby, and
sings with the same kind of melan-
choly self-obsession. Maybe it is Mo-
by’s alter-ego? It’s unlikely because
this is actually pretty good. It’s quiet
and haunting and more than a little bit
comforting, in the same way that Elliot
Smith songs are. - Alex Ashford

This take on Alan Vega’s original from
LCD Soundsystem is a straightfor-
ward, slow build romp in the same
vein as ‘All My Friends’ off their 2007
album. Groovy bass lines and cool, airy
vocals make it pretty listenable, but
it is lacking in the vivacity of classic
tracks such as ‘North American Scum’.

The upbeat acoustic guitar and occa-
sional clever samples disguise a range
of bleaker topics than is apparent on
first inspection. His lo-fi approach and
singing voice, is reminiscent of artists
like Badly Drawn Boy. This is small-
venue, intimate stuff; the music would
feel out of place in on a big stage, (ex-
cept Glastonbury, at least), somewhere
like the Troubadour - it could be really
special. - Duncan Casey

a set of songs of such consistent and
perhaps superior quality.
Funeral for a Friend are hard to rec-
ommend to anyone with decent musi-
cal taste, but with so many anthems I
promise you their live show is a fulfill-
ing experience.
