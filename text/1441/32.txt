The Versus Round - Arkham Asylum
The latest part of the Batman saga is out, but is bat-tastic or a joker? Adam Omar and Nick Virago fight it out
L
et’s start with the positives.
The voice acting is spot
on. Most of the main cast
of Batman: The Animated
Series is present, and they
do a good job. Special mention goes
to Mark ‘Luke Skywalker’ Hamill,
who plays the Joker. His cackling voice
spews such wonderful lines as “Tell
me Bats, what are you really scared of?
Failing to save this cesspool of a city?
Not finding the commissioner in time?
ME! In a thong??”
The art direction and sense of style
and atmosphere are amazing, and
thankfully they mimic the cartoon
and the comics more than the recent
movies. The game engine, however, is
crap. No matter how many bloom and
fog effects they smear on the screen,
the graphics never look good (from a
technical point of view); it’s sort of like
a Vauxhall with red paint and a Ferrari
badge. True to its console roots, tex-
tures are low-res and repeated ad in-
finitum. No matter how high you turn
up the resolution, it’ll look crap with-
out lots of anti-aliasing on and it’ll run
crap unless PhysX is turned off. PhysX
doesn’t really add anything anyway be-
sides cloth-ier cloth and cobweb-ier
cobwebs and foggier fog.
Now we get to the meat (or rather,
the rotting maggot ridden carrion) of
the game, the gameplay. You will spend
a large portion of your time in Arkham
Asylum running down look-alike cor-
ridors and beating up groups of thugs.
This is where things fall apart. One
button is used as an all-purpose attack
button. You cannot control exactly
what he does; you can merely point in
the rough direction of an enemy and
click. It looks impressive in game, with
Batman twirling and flipping like a true
master, but all the player will have to do
is left click, left click, left click. Right-
clicking activates your counter move,
which you only press when you see a
blue sign, quick-time-event style. You
have absolutely no control over what
Batman actually does, only whether
or not he does it. There is such a large
difference between your control inputs
and what actually happens in the game;
you might as well sit on the mouse and
let your buttocks play the game. The
cherry on the proverbial excrement
cake is the unskippable slow-motion
scene you have to sit through each time
you kill the last enemy in a group.
The combat, although horrible, isn’t
nearly as infuriating as the ‘Detective
Mode’. The detective mode lets you see
through walls and makes evidence and
important items glow bright
orange. also highlights
nearby ene-
mies, and dis-
plays such
useless in-
formation as: ‘2 hostiles detected, 1
unarmed, 1 armed’. Yeah no shit, Sher-
lock. As if I needed to press a button to
get that bit of information, as opposed
to, you know, simply counting the
number of enemies on screen and hav-
ing a look at whether or not they’ve got
weapons? Once in a while the player
will have to use the ‘evidence scanner’
portion of the detective mode. The
evidence scanner is basically like a bad
point and click adventure game – scan
every pixel till you find the object that
glows. Not exactly prime detective
work.
A word about physics. I find it per-
plexing that this game completely
wasted many many good physics-y op-
portunities. More development time
should have gone to the grappling
hook, rather than the cape.
Other gripes include the Riddler
collectibles strewn about the game
world – obviously a cheap way to
extend game time, though they do
break the immersion somewhat.
The checkpoint save system is
always a bad idea, no matter
what game it’s in. It’s espe-
cially annoying here since
checkpoints aren’t where
you expect them to be,
e.g. the start of each
level not being a
checkpoint. Also, a
flock of black bats
appear and fly to-
wards the top left
corner of the screen
every time you gain
experience. All this
experience you get
is used to purchase
ability and equip-
ment upgrades,
which seems a bit
odd, since it’s essen-
tially Batman paying
himself for his own stuff.
Also, the batarang infi-
nite ammo and auto-
aim removes any
need for skill.
Batman Arkham
Asylum is an utter
disappointment.
There’s a sense
throughout
the game that
it could have
been so
much bet-
ter, if only
it hadn’t
been de-
signed to
cater to
the lowest
common
primordial
ooze de- nomi-
nator. The grime at the
bottom of your bathtub
could play it. The game
is just too easy,
and far too
auto-
mated. It really
is the equivalent
of watching a Bat-
man movie while randomly
clicking away on your mouse
“...left click, left
click, left click...”
Opinionated bastard?

your keyboard angrily in the

T
here are two types of great
game. There are games
which innovate, but stum-
ble. Games like the flawed
ARMA 2, a game riddled
with gigantic, fun-ruining bugs, which
is still great because it communicates
its vision of large-scale, beautifully-
realised warfare. Then there are games
that refine. Games that take a template,
a well-established style, and build it
from the ground up, fixing the prob-
lems, enhancing the good bits, polish-
ing and sanding down a genre. Step
forward Batman: Arkham Asylum, the
latest beautiful refinement of the third
person action adventure.
The aim here was clearly to sew to-
gether the good bits of being Batman
and chop off the bad. Combat is a
great example - it eschews fiddle but-
ton combinations, instead preferring
to keep both eyes and brain locked
to the screen, asking you to choose
the next target. This removes the
need to memorise a keyboard lay-
out, and instead neatly emphasises
the need to keep an eye out for
threats. You’re Batman. You
know how to do a reverse-up-
percut-ollie-
crotchgrab.
So you
don’t need
to worry
about it - in-
stead, you’re
watching to see who’s
got a gun, who’s running to
alert the others, who’s getting ready to
lunge in with a kick. You know, super-
hero stuff. Stuff that makes your chest
bulge and your biceps break out of
that smelly, unwashed t-shirt.
This is the key - WWBD? If Bat-
man would do it, add it in. That’s
fun. If he wouldn’t, chuck it. Be-
cause the odds are that those things
are gamey and dull.
So stealth, say, isn’t a case of alarms
and view cones and countdowns and
snore, snore, snore. You’re the fuck-
ing Batman, right? Death shadow?
Angel of darkness? You grapple into
the shadows, and you’re gone. To
a gamer, that sounds like an easy
way out, oversimplifying the game
mechanics. But the goons are still
there, the puzzles are still unsolved,
the objectives incomplete. And ul-
timately, you’re still very weak, and
very prone to Bullet In The Face
syndrome. No, the grapple-tastic
freedom doesn’t make the game
too easy. It just makes you a
bit more like Batman. Are
you noticing the pat-
tern that’s forming
here?
“Tight” and “Sol-
id” are the words
you’ll hear describ-
ing this game. It’s finessed,
polished, the graphics are well-
rounded without demanding you
upgrade the old box in the corner.
The UIs give you exactly the informa-
tion you need - no more, no less. That
takes careful design. The voice acting
is well-directed, full of life and yet not
overused and annoying. It’s an elegant
balancing act of a game, and a joy to
play as a result.
And it’s not a classic, alright. Let’s get
that straight. Batman isn’t going into
the history books here no matter what
talk you hear of ‘Game of the Year’.
Because Batman doesn’t innovate, it’s
happy just to do a job and do it well.
The hublike layout of the eponymous
asylum is straight out of a mid-nineties
platformer, and there are boss fights
which - yes, Dara - require you to do
something three times before victory.
It’s true. But being content with doing
a good job isn’t a bad thing.
It all gels together so well, it all con-
nects up in such a beautiful way, and it
wants you to play it. It does. It remem-
bers that challenge in games shouldn’t
be like an end-of-term exam, but like
a kickabout in Hyde Park with some
mates. You’re having fun, while dis-
playing a skill. You’re not performing
strict instructions under the threat of
punishment. You’re mucking around.
You want to lure twelve goons into an
epic fist-fight? Do it! Or pick them off
one by one and hear them scream and
get paranoid. Smear exploding glue on
the walls. Do what you want.
It’s a toybox, through and through,
and that’s a good thing. The challenge
modes, for instance, are all about get-
ting better at the balletic combat - not
about the memory, but about the feel-
ing. About being the powerhouse, the
iron-clad motherbitch without need-
ing to fiddle around with a gamepad or
look up the best moves online.
It can feel a little counterproduc-
tive at times, but Batman’s sense of
freedom and character is a strength,
not a weakness. The game is a linear
thing, and some elements are laugh-
ably last-year. But it sets out to do one
thing - deliver on the license. And after
a string of terrible, terrible games that
are supposed to support a franchise of
some kind, Batman is the first one in a
long, long time that actually manages
to convey the material it’s based on.
When I first played Batman, I was
initially put off. It seemed overblown,
and I’m always hesitant when people
start declaring something to be this
good.
But Batman really is special.
“...you are
the goddamn
Batman...”
