One small step for science & free speech

The most recent development in the Simon Singh libel case brings hope to the global cientific community
Last Wednesday morning, in a large
and mostly empty courtroom in the
Royal Courts of Justice, science writer
Simon Singh won the right to appeal
the ruling of the meaning of one sen-
tence of an article he wrote some eight-
een months ago.
Why should you, I, or for that mat-
ter, anyone care? Well, the article in
question regarded whether the ma-
nipulation of babies’ spines was in any
way effective for the treatment of ear
infections (no), or potentially dam-
aging to their health (unsurprisingly,
the evidence suggests this may be the
case); the appeal regards whether or
not Singh, as a scientist and writer,
could criticise such potentially dan-
gerous practices in the public domain.
Rather than present their evidence and
publically argue the point, the British
Chiropractic Association attempted
to stifle any debate by suing for libel in
the courts.
Singh now faces being bankrupted
by the practitioners of this dubious art,
for ‘defaming their reputation’ through
what many argue is a very valid criti-
cism. As a result, the outcome could
be vital for us all: for science to move
forward, we have to be able to pick
holes in one another’s ideas and prac-
tices, and if this can be quashed via the
courts rather than through research
and analysis of the data, then we may
as well all go home. Furthermore, this
isn’t just about someone’s pet ideas – if
data regarding ineffective and poten-
tially harmful ‘therapies’ can be hidden
in this way, how can you or anyone else
possibly make an informed decision
regarding their health or that of their
children?
The outcome of this case may well
yet be positive, whether Singh eventu-
ally wins or loses the protracted legal
argument. A campaign orchestrated
by Sense About Science has garnered
some twenty thousand signatures in
support of both his case and numerous
others, where scientists and potential
whistleblowers have been prevented
from making factually accurate state-
ments under fear of prosecution due
to Britain’s arcane libel laws. Look it
up and add your name: in the course of
your career as a scientist, you will defi-
nitely be called upon to criticise the
work of others. Whether you are able
to or not without fear of reprisal may
depend upon the outcome of this case.

Scientists disparage UKBA plan for genetic passports

ShupaulaDass Science Reporter
We’ve all had that awful passport
photo. The one that fails to capture
our natural beauty or at the very least,
oneself on an OK day. We may envy
those without passports. Or not. The
British government is now toying with
the idea of using genetics to identify
nationality.
The UK Border Agency has con-
tacted researchers with a proposal of
genetically testing asylum seekers, spe-
cifically from the war fractured Soma-
lia. Their goal is to separate the genuine
applicants from those in neighbouring
Kenya. Unfortunately for the paper
pushers, this will remain a dream as
the latest editorial in Nature dispar-
ages the plan; ‘[The] scheme to estab-
lish nationality through DNA testing is
scientifically flawed, ethically dubious
and damaging to science.’
In a nutshell, the government want-
ed to examine the unique SNPs (sin-
gle nucleotide polymorphisms) in the
mitochondria of approximately 100
‘Somalians’.
An SNP is exactly what it says on
the tin. A variation in DNA sequence
of a genome attributed to a single nu-
cleotide - A, T, G, or C and it differs
between members of a species. For
example:
Person 1 reads: ATGGC
Person 2 reads: ATGAC
Traditionally if these differences in
alleles (the G and the A from Persons
1 and 2) occurred at a frequency of 1%
or greater, they were labeled as SNPs
or snips. However as science has pro-
gressed, snips that occur less than 1%
are included.
The genotyping of SNPs is probably
what has conjured the idea of ‘genetici-
sation’ of nationality.
Recently scientists have compiled
substantial SNP databases, leading to
easier geographical identification of
European groups. However scientists
stress that it would be like a shot in the
dark to apply this method to a conti-
nent such as Africa.
We at Felix asked visiting Professor
David Balding, a population geneti-
cist, why European populations are
easier to study than African. ‘Nobody
has quantified the misclassification
rate. Europeans are very well studied
and relatively homogeneous; their ge-
netic patterns are fairly simple because
of the recent settlement of much of
Europe. African populations go back
further in time, have greater levels of
genetic variation and are not well stud-
ied. I do not think the research exists
to adequately underpin the proposed
programme. Even if it did there would
still be a relatively high error rate be-
cause of recent migrations.’
Another method voiced involved
using the isotopic ratios of elements
found in hair and fingernails. These
provide an indication of an individual’s
diet and environment. Again this ar-
gument can be quashed. It does not
take into account the factor of human
populations migrating, which has hap-
pened for thousands of years. Genetic
variability is not confined to borders.
Epigenetics (the idea that the environ-
ment interacts with our genes) is pos-
sible, but to base a person’s future en-
tirely on such methods is incredulous.
Proposal for genuine asylum seekers to be identfied through genetic testing deemed ‘scientifically flawed’
An example of this failing would be
a Somalian who has parents from two
different geographic regions. This
child would be of a third region be-
longing to neither ‘genetic geographic
region’. A simple concept, but omitted
entirely from the UK Border Agency’s
plan. They seem to be confusing ances-
try with nationality.
Beyond the fickle rationale of the
government’s plans, the implications
of enforcing the genetic testing are se-
vere. If they wanted to pursue this path,
large genetic samples from Somalia
and surrounding countries would be
needed, raising the issue of time and
money. Many groups would inevita-
bly come forward to protest such as
migration organizations, population
geneticists and the public themselves.
Currently asylum seekers have the
choice of providing swabs for testing
or not. If the genetic testing becomes
standard procedure and an individual
rejects, it could worsen the relations
and situation. Further cause of suspi-
cion would only be aroused as a result.
As Orwell predicted in his novel
1984, we are in a Big Brother age.
With so many advances it has become
hard to rein in scientific speculation.
Technically by now we should all have
national I.D cards, our iris scans on
record and flying around campus on
hoverboards. Whilst the latter may still
be a little far fetched, so is the idea of
genetic passports at this time, or ever.
Thankfully, the government has back-
tracked on their idea, but they haven’t
dismissed it altogether.
I don’t know about you but I don’t
mind my passport photo so much now.
In any case, it expires in 10 years.

reputation’ of the British Chiropractic Association
