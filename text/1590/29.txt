Stink Foot: Greek Theatre Reimagined
Two men fight half-naked
in a puddle of golden syrup.
One has a magic bow in his
hand and the other tries to avoid
him shooting down the lady playing
Odysseus. The shadows on the wall
reflect the play on the stage. An
innovative performance, such that
you have never seen before, at student
friendly prices. A must-see.
Stink Foot is a new adaptation of
Sophocles’ Greek tragedy Philoctetes;
Philoctetes’ foot is not stinking, but
smells like sweet treacle, Odysseus
is a female, and Noptolemus, the
son of Achilles, is overly straight.
Philoctetes has a magic bow, a reward
for saving Hercules’ life, but was
abandoned on a desert island by
Odysseus, simply because no one in
Greece could bear the smell of his
poisoned foot. But now the Greeks
need to use of the bow in the long
ongoing Trojan War.
When I set foot in the Yard Theatre
and walked across the stage – built
from recycled materials – to find
my seat, I knew I was going to see
something unusual. But it is perhaps
more accurate to say that there
was no stage at all, with the actors
performing right in front of, and
sometimes behind us. I felt that what
I would see would be really involving
and lively, but the cast exceeded my
wildest expectations.
The story may not be long and
complicated, but it can be interpreted
in a myriad of ways. It shows us
two entirely different characters,
employing two different kinds of
persuasion, allowing us to see the
result of each.
It is like good cop versus bad cop,
one being kind and empathetic, the
other authoritarian, while giving
us an insight into the ruthless and
selfish nature of humanity. Even
without any interpretation the story
was easy to follow; despite the rather
simplistic plot our attention was
maintained due lively dialogues,
brilliant acting, and director Jeff
James’ innovative means of depiction:
displaying pain with harsh noise,
having Philoctetes’ foot ooze golden
syrup, using a DJ mixer to convey
divine messages – these are all ways
to bring the audience closer to the
performance.
Perhaps I wouldn’t recommend
this play for those who are expecting
a full, epic story, or all night
entertainment, given its snappy
70 minute run-time. But for those
who enjoy watching well developed,
fleshed-out characters, appreciate
excellent lighting and sound design,
and are interested in the director’s
panache, then I couldn’t recommend
Stink Foot highly enough. Theatre
has never felt so alive!

Taking on the Classics: A Director’s How-To Guide
How do you go about
reinventing the wheel? This
was the question facing Jeff
James when he decided to take on
Sophocles’ classic piece of drama
Philoctetes; directing and writing
the adaptation himself, James has
shaped the play into something
new, renaming it Stink Foot after
Philoctetes’ main feature: his rotting,
stinking foot. It was this foot that
led to him being abandoned on the
island of Lemnos for ten years, until
it is prophesied that he is needed
back in Troy in order for the Greeks
to win the war; it is up to young
Neoptolemus to convince him to
return, using every ounce of skill
and cunning in his mind. It’s a heavy
mantle to take on, and so we sat
down with James for a chat about the
challenges of adapting Greek drama,
the relevance of the play to modern
life, and the dangers of using gallons
of treacle on stage.
So firstly, when did James become
aware of the play? ‘I’d read Sophocles
at university, and thought that this
play was very interesting, funny, and
profound – I kept coming back to
it, but thought it was too difficult’,
says James; eventually it was a friend
who pushed him to produce the
play, saying ‘if that’s the play that’s
obsessing you, then you should go
for it’. And taking on Sophocles as
his first adaptation, was that always
the plan? “No, initially I didn’t know
I would write it,” admits James, “but
there were things that I could feel
in the play, and wanted to express”.
After a period of deliberation – “one
scenario was to employ a writer, and
adapt it in collaboration” – James
ultimately felt that by writing the
adaptation himself it would be “easier
to get these ideas across”.
Luckily he wasn’t alone in the
endeavour; he has enlisted the help of
designer Alex Lowde, with whom he
worked in a Young Vic workshop the
previous year. Together they came
up with an ingenious staging device:
treacle. 250 kg of the stuff, which
oozes out of the sores on Philoctetes’
leg, eventually covering the pristine
stage. “The treacle idea actually
came really early on in the process”,
says James, “a nasty black pool is
an interesting way of representing
Philoctetes’ foot, which is supposed
to be the most horrible foot in the
world.” But the treacle takes on a
more symbolic role too: “the play is
about morality; Neo is employed to
trick Philoctetes, who is essentially a
lonely disabled man. He starts off by
saying that he isn’t the kind of person
to trick people, but it’s a question of
ethical compromise”. As James puts
it succinctly: “in the end everyone is
just lost in this shit”.
Like many things in the theatre
(pyrotechnics, children, live animals),
working with treacle can pose a
unique set of challenges for the
actors. These can be both physical –
‘the actors would slip everywhere...
the treacle pulled out body hair’ – and
mental – James mentions that “it
was interesting to see how a person’s
acting style can change as they
become covered with the treacle.” The
presence of the treacle means that it’s
a fine balance (literally) between the
actor’s intentions and their physical
limitations.
This isn’t the first time James
has turned his attention to classic
theatre, having previously directed
plays by Anton Chekhov and Harold
Pinter, but he admits that he is “a bit
bewildered by the distinction between
new writing and classic texts in the
British theatre industry”. He follows
the maxim of George Devine, one
of the founders of the Royal Court’s
resident company, who said “treat
new plays like classics, and classics
like new plays”, but admits that it
can sometimes be easier to access the
classic texts: “these classic plays exist,
and it is easier to access them than
to access the very best new writing,
which often goes straight to the Royal
Court”.
But are these plays still relevant to
the modern age? “Yeah, I think these
classic plays still explore modern
ideas”, says James, who explored the
link between Sophocles and urban
life in his article The Desert Island
and the City. “The desert island
never becomes a home – even after
years there, the castaway still wants
to return home”, he writes, “we are
unable to get used to the strangeness
of living alongside so many other
people, but the only thing worse
would be to live alone”. Alongside
this theme of alienation and ethical
compromise, the play also explores
“the difficulty of having a body;
the materiality of it”, as expressed
through the ever-present, stinking
foot of Philoctetes.
It can be difficult to adapt any
classic text, and James is aware of the
possible pitfalls: “when you adapt
well known texts people can get quite
upset if they come to see it and don’t
recognise the play exactly as they
know it”. But taking on Sophocles
comes with its own challenges:
“the form of the play is so strange”,
explains James, “Sophocles had so
many radical ideas about the theatre,
and it’s so exciting that he engages
with the form at that level... but every
other line in the play is a reference
to a classic story or figure, the kind
that would be relevant to Greek
audiences”.
So what is his solution to this
problem, which can lead to the ‘play
resisting you’? “I tried to cut out all
the references”, says James, “except
the ones where we could show the
audience exactly what we meant”.
Ultimately any form of adaptation
is daunting, and James has set his
sights high by starting with one of
the founding fathers of the theatre,
but during our conversation his
energy and passion for the project
is evident. Does he hope that this
will encourage a new generation to
explore Greek theatre? Perhaps. “It’s
not a question of accessibility, more
about communicating the things
that I really want to get across. But if
people get into Sophocles because of
this, that would be amazing.”
