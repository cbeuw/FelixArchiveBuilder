A Reimagination of Biblical Size
"It's a
good idea
with truly
disastrous
results"
Two huge, historically successful
institutions which have
recently lost their appeal,
their relevance and many of their
dedicated followers: Opera and
Christianity. What better way to
show the reviving powers of art than
to create an exciting, contemporary
opera about the Passion of Christ? As
pretty much everything in this new
piece by John Adams, it’s a good idea
with truly disastrous results.
The Gospel according to the
other Mary, which the composer
describes as a “Passion oratorio”,
is a companion piece to his much
acclaimed piece El Nino, about the
birth of Jesus. It aims to tell the other
central Christian story, the Passion
of Christ, though even this simple
concept is not necessarily obvious
from the staging of the production.
In an attempt to score triple brownie
points (contemporary opera,
contemporary take on Christianity
and awareness of social injustice and
gender issues) the opera is recounted
from the point of view of the women
who partook in Jesus’ life: Mary
Magdalene, her sister Martha and
the downtrodden, disenfranchised
and exploited women who made up
the core of his early followers. Mary
Magdalene is initially a promising
character; jailed for political protest,
abused and mistreated in her past,
she is an unstable, self-harming and
mystical character, embodying the
ambiguous sensuous-spiritual love for
Christ that the traditional redeemed-
prostitute view of her hints at. After
a few hopeful scenes however she
seems to just drift around pointlessly,
leaving the leading role to secondary
characters. This is a real shame,
as the reinterpretation of Mary in
this modern key is one of the most
original ideas of this derivative and
repetitive production.
The opera is split in two acts, each
of which recounts key stories from
the Passion. The staging is modern
but so sparse and inconsistent that it
is hard to place. We’re told that Mary
has been to prison, in which her cell
mate was a drug addict going cold
turkey and that Martha runs a hostel
for homeless women, setting the
scene for a tough urban setting. Most
of the large choral scenes, showing
large dissatisfied rebellious crowds,
are sung in Spanish, evoking scenes of
20th
Century workers protest in South
America. Above it all floats a moving
cloth with painted images of the
prostate body of Christ. It is doubtful
whether Peter Sellars, the director,
had a clear idea of what he wanted
the stage to look like, but if he did, he
certainly did not get round to telling
anyone else.
The interesting idea in the opera
is the recounting of Biblical stories
through the eyes of women. To
do this Sellars, who also wrote the
libretto, took female-friendly (or at
least neutral) texts from both the
Old and the New testament, bulking
them out with an interesting array
of 20th
century poetry and texts
from Saint Hildegard of Bingen (a
12th
century mystic). These create
excellent juxtapositions, taking
the edge off the preachy-ness by
integrating well known biblical
phrases with emotionally charged,
graphic language. Regrettably, the
libretto does not shine as it should,
despite the very competent soloists.
The dramatic text and rousing
(though long winded) music don’t
do enough to lift the drab stage and
passive cast. The opera is trying to
tell us that the motives and problems
that motivated Jesus and his early
followers are as pressing and relevant
today as they were then, but how can
we believe it when the cast display so
little involvement and commitment?
Their passivity is slightly mitigated
by four “dancer” figures, who animate
the characters like shadows. Most
of the time they’re an annoyance,
and further confuse the story as
they are not fixed to their character,
flitting from one to the other as
props in a school play. The one
glorious exception to this (almost the
redeeming feature of this production)
is Banks, an astonishing flex-dancer
who represents the moods of each
scene. The second act is completely
taken over by him, as he is the only
alive, vibrant and interesting thing
left in the performance. Certainly his
presence is a bit odd, and definitely
distracting from the story, but his
performance is so extraordinary
compared to the flat, lifeless and
convoluted production that his
presence is defiantly a relief.
It’s a shame to have picked up so
many promising ideas and to have
ruined every one of them- John
Adams and Peter Sellars would have
done well to take tips from Andrew
Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice about
how to make an edgy contemporary
opera about Jesus- the Gospel
According to the Other Mary has
none of the snappy popularity of
Jesus Christ Superstar, none of the
intimate spirituality if faith and
nothing that could keep the audience
in their seats past the interval.
The Gospel According to the Other
Mary runs at the ENO’s Coliseum until
5th December. Tickets available from £5.

The Western Canon.For some,it is
the creme-de-la-creme of artistic
expression; a source of extreme
beauty,and due recognition for a
number of writers.For others it is
an outdated concept,one that reeks
of Western imperialism,racism,
and misogyny.But what happens
when you want to reinterpret a
classic work? In this issue of Felix,
we are looking at how classics are
transformed by contemporary
artists.
We start off with the ENO,who
are taking on possibly the most
well known piece of art in the
entire world: The Holy Bible.In The
GospelAccordingtotheOtherMary,
John Adams has scored a dramatic
retelling of the story of Jesus.
Clara Novela Clark delves into this
opera,and lets us know whether it
is a biblical success,or just an epic
failure.
Elsewhere,Jeff James takes on a
new reimagining of Sophocles’
ancient drama Philoctetes; through
careful adaptation and radical
direction,James has transposed the
play into the modern age,turning
it into a treacle-soaked production
-StinkFoot.Peter Sarvari heads
down to The Yard Theatre to give
his judgement on the play,while we
sit down for a chat with the director
to ind out the challenges of taking
on a classic.
Peter Sarvari also heads down to
The Barbican Centre to check out
HowietheRookie, a dive into the
alcohol-soaked realm of Dublin’s
criminal underworld,bringing with
it ierce lyricism and manic energy.
The lack of multiculturalism in
the Western canon is taken on by
Indira Malik,who utterly destroys
the idea that medieval art features
only Caucasian people.Taking on
a whole range of examples,from
Black Madonnas to Hieronymus
Bosch,she explores how black and
Asian people have largely been
written out of this art history.
Finally,Kieran Ryan challenges
the idea that the impossible
is unobtainable.Taking an
inspirational quote from author
Neil Gaiman as a starting point,he
gives some examples of artists who
have achieved the impossible,and
in the process transformed the art
world around them.One such artist
is Llew Watkins,who will be giving
a talk at Imperial next Wednesday.
So that’s it for this week’s issue;
hopefully we should have showed
you that it is possible for art to
transform not only your view of
classic works,but the whole world
too.
