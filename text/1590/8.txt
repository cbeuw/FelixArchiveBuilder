The St Louis suburb of Ferguson
was calm on Thanksgiving
morning, after two nights
or protests. The suburb has been
unsettled since 9th August when
police officer Darren Wilson shot and
killed civilian Michael Brown. Mr
Wilson, who shot Brown six or seven
times said that he “feared for his life”.
Witnesses, however, claimed that Mr
Brown, who was not armed, had his
hands up when the first shots were
fired.
On Tuesday a jury chose not to
charge Mr Wilson for the killing
and as a result clear the police
officer of any wrongdoing. This
sparked protests in Ferguson, which
were peaceful. The protests, which
consisted of an estimated 100 people
marching through the streets, were
conducted in the snow. It is believed
that the bad weather may have had
an effect on the number of people
protesting.
Police Officer Wilson said
afterwards on television that he
had “a clean conscience” over the
shooting. This statement was branded
as “disrespectful” by Mr Brown’s
mother, who went on to add that
she does not believe the policeman’s
account of what happened that night.
Mr Brown’s father said that
prosecutors had “crucified” his son
in a character assassination. He then
requested that all protesters remain
peaceful.
Meanwhile, in California, protests
turned violent in Oakland and Los
Angeles. More than 100 people were
arrested in demonstrations, most of
them from Los Angeles.
The police have since released a
statement saying that protestors had
vandalised buildings in Oakland
RAG holds successful charity bike auction
RAG held their charity bike auc-
tion last Thursday, raising an
impressive £4,500 after selling
roughly 30 bikes.
The auction took place on the steps
leading up to Queen’s Tower, and was
attended by around 150 students.
Half of the funds raised will go to the
Bike Users Group (BUG), a student
club that oversees students who cycle
on a regular basis.
The other half went to RAG’s main
charities, twenty20, Kids UK and
Lively Minds.
RAG also had police present to
mark bikes to track them if stolen,
and mechanics there to check over the
bikes themselves. The bikes, sourced
from those left on campus over the
summer, came in various shapes,
sizes, and states, but many went for
prices below their actual face value.
The auctioneer was Neil Mosley,
head of Sport Imperial and apparent
owner of a megaphone.
RAG have also announced their
charities for their upcoming RAG
week; they will be raising money for
Tiny Tickers, Mines Advisory Group
and St Mungo’s broadway.
RAG Chair Ben Fernando said of
the day: “An absolutely amazing day
that raised a huge amount of money
for our chosen causes.
“We’re proud it went so smoothly
and that so many people were able
to become more environmentally
friendly through the purchase of a
cheap bicycle.
“We look forward to more
successful bike auctions!”
