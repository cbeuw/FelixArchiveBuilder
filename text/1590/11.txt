FELIX
Let’s
get
hyper
Her bubbly personality and cheerful
demeanour brings smiles to the
English audience.
Chasing your dream through
twenty years of hard work and
perseverance paints a clear image
of the undeterrable heart beneath
the easy smiles. Diana first moved
to Japan at the age of sixteen, a
daunting prospect enough for anyone
wishing to move to a country with
0.07% native English speakers. On
her third and most recent visit to
Japan, Diana also became an English
teacher, instructing schoolchildren
around middle school age. I asked
her about the motivation behind her
singing – a fervent and passionate
intensity which can be felt during her
renditions.
“As a schoolteacher, I often get
kids coming up to me when they’re
young with their dreams of becoming
Pokémon masters, superheroes, and
famous ice skaters along with all
sorts of wonderful things. But then
they grow up and settle into their
perceived reality of just being able to
live as an office worker somewhere.
It’s heart-breaking. I sing for my
fans and anyone who happens to be
listening, in the hopes that they’ll be
brave enough to follow their heart
once again.”
Fundamental differences in the
construction of sentences, such as
omission of articles and subjects,
all contribute to the difficulty of
learning English as a native Japanese
speaker. Diana’s songs are all in
Japanese only; is the language barrier
a problem this way?
“The focus of the songs is not
the language, but the sound and
music,” Diana tells me. Japanese is
naturally a very lyrical and expressive
language due to its liquid consonants
and this makes it still remarkably
communicative even to a non-speaker
like me. As a musician myself, Diana
and I concur by bringing up the
indisputable fact that music is the
true universal language of expression.
The realisation of a dream may not
necessarily come as a single, cathartic,
watershed moment. Diana continues
to work on her music and she starts
by collaborating with Joe Inoue,
announcing their work on December
1st. Joe is an American-born Japanese
pop artist whose gained prominence
through his song ‘Closer’ being used
for the opening song of the anime
series Naruto. Joe is well-known for
playing all the instruments in the
backing track when he records a new
song – in fact, his Facebook page
description includes the line “Plays
all instruments.” I manage to get
a few words with him too, after he
agreed to marry a fan in the audience.
It remains to be seen if he is as true to
his word as he is dedicated to the red
bean ice cream he claims he loves –
“it’s delicious and healthy,” he claims,
right before Diana quips back “it’s not
healthy, it’s ice cream.”
Joe was born to Japanese
immigrants in California, and learnt
Japanese from reading manga and
watching anime, despite growing
up in Los Angeles. “I had to teach
myself,” he tells me, “but the comics
are definitely the number one
Japanese textbook.” As well as playing
all the instruments in all of his songs
and composing all of them himself,
almost all of his song lyrics are in
Japanese too. It’s Joe’s first time in
Europe and he expresses confusion at
the reason why the audience weren’t
receptive to his American-style jokes
about boobs and such on stage. I tell
him that they’re just being polite.
HYPER JAPAN showcased a
strikingly extraordinary cultural
event, with a very strong inspirational
aftertaste. The message is clear.
Pursue your dream, and you’ll end up
living it.
