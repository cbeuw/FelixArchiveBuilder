Iwas sat in a job interview,
nervously trying to justify my
existence to a stranger and I was
asked “Why did you chose to study
at Imperial?”. I think I managed
to persuade him it wasn’t because
Cambridge had rejected me and that
it was in fact, “Imperial’s academic
rigour and forward thinking ethos”.
If I’m honest I applied because it was
top of the league tables and I came
because I managed to get the grades.
But how do aspiring students
choose universities? This is the
question a recent report by Which?
tried to answer. It’s important
because with fees at £9000 per
annum, sixth form students are
expected to make rational consumer
decisions and commit to spending
around £45,000 on a degree. All this
before you’re legally allowed to take
out a normal loan.
I’m fortunate. I’m very confident
that my £3,450 per year fees are
a worthy investment. Simply
comparing the mean Imperial
graduate salary with the median
UK salary is enough to show that.
But that isn’t always the case. The
Which? survey (which didn’t mention
Imperial specifically) found 3 in
10 undergraduates thought their
experience was poor value and that
35% said they are “unlikely to have
attended university faced with
higher fees”.
The risk that a course is a waste of
time and money is not just borne by
the student. It’s a loan you’ll only
pay back if you earn enough money,
so the risk is also with tax payers,
who are the very people we tried to
reduce the burden on by introducing
fees in the first place.
In fact, the government now
loses 45p of every £1 it lends to
students. Last year the student loans
company paid out £12.5 billion in
loans to students and that’s set to
rise. The higher education sector is
haemorrhaging money.
If you arrive at a university and
find that your lectures aren’t quite
worth the £50 each you’re paying,
you’re stuck. There’s no chance
to transfer to another university
– you just have to start again and
pay another set of fees. If you drop
out completely you have to pay
back the fees, but you’re not even
a graduate. In most industries the
consumer is protected by a regulator.
If you buy a broken car, you get it
replaced or refunded. But if you get
a useless course, you’re stuck with
it; no refunds apart from extreme
situations. The universities bear a
very small amount of risk in the
game, it’s the students and the
government who take the risk. The
exact opposite of normal business
where the shareholders risk their
investment if the customers leave.
If students are to be consumers,
then we need the protection and
rights that come with that. This
should be one of the benefits of the
tuition fee system but it has yet to
happen. Why? Because if a course
can’t keep its students happy, and
they all leave with refunds, that
course won’t be open for long. The
good departments will flourish but
the poor departments will close.
It’s creative destruction capitalism
– students got their brunt of the
deal when the fees trebled. Now
universities have to face the reality
of the economic market too, and
something tells me they won’t like
it either.
The transition of the tuition
fee model won’t be complete till
departments who don’t pay for
themselves have to close.

On Monday Spanish newspa-
pers reported that BT were
in talks with Telefonica over
a potential takeover of O2. It later
emerged that BT are also discuss-
ing the purchase of EE from French
company Orange S.A. and German
company Deutsche Telekom. But
what would this mean for us? Should
we be worried, or excited?
The move from BT shows clear
intent to enter the mobile market.
Since spinning off O2 in 2001 (then
called BT Cellnet), BT has often
regretted not being in the mobile
market. They have made attempts to
slowly move back in through deals
with O2 and EE over the past couple
of years.
With this deal (whoever it may
come from) BT will suddenly have a
market share of more than 29% (EE
actually has 33% at the moment),
and a platform from which to launch
a new ‘Quad-Play’ service. Quad-Play
is a package currently on sale in Eu-
rope that offers Internet, television,
landline and mobile in one bundle.
It has proved to be popular in Europe
but is largely unproven in the United
Kingdom. Virgin Media attempted
it, but with limited success.
So, what does this mean for us?
Should we be worried about rising
prices as a result? At the moment
analysts are split, with some saying
that prices will increase, whilst some
believe that it will, in fact, decrease.
Early indications would suggest that
if Quad-Play is something that you
are interested in then this is great
news, as bundles in Europe have
been sold at significant discounts.
The other side of the coin, though,
is BT’s costs. Having spent more
than £2.5 billion to upgrade its fibre
optic networks and £2 billion on
television rights in sport, BT have
a lot of money to make up. The
estimated £10 billion that will be
needed to complete the takeover

will not help matters either. When
BT last spent this much, our line
rental costs went up by a significant
amount. Expect similar things to
happen if you choose not to go with
Quad-Play.
The other intriguing point that
stems from this is whether other
companies will follow suit. Vodafone
have already been touted to form
a partnership with BSkyB if BT’s
move proves successful, and it is also
thought that TalkTalk will be look-
ing for a partner.
One thing is for sure though –
many will watch BT’s next moves
with fascination and intrigue.
BT is moving back into mobile. Panic stations?
