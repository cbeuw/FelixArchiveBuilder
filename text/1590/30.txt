Ruthless. Disgusting. But Honest, with Truth to Tell.
PETER SARVARI
ARTS WRITER
Howie the Rookie is an 80
minute single-actor play
directed by Mark O’Hove and
performed by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor,
playing from the 19th to the 29th
November in The Barbican Centre’s
Pit Theatre. The piece won two prizes,
attracted critical acclaim, and also
won the Irish Times Best New Play
award. After all these fancy lines let
me now dig deep into soul of the play
and show what I found.
It all starts with that fearful
repetitive sound. It describes the
mood of the night really well, the
pub and the pitiful characters, who
have no way out of the wood. This
first sentence leads me to discuss
one word: character. Yes, but in what
sense? Vaughan-Lawlor played one
character – Howie – and then in the
second half of the play switched to
Rookie; during this, sometimes he
played others, sometimes he did
not. But we know others existed,
because he both mentions them
while he was acting, and also since
social interactions with other people
were expressed by Vaughan-Lower’s
original character. After this long
and complicated diatribe, aimed at
explaining how one actor can give
birth to several ones who are playing
different characters, one is very likely
to ask if the storyline can be followed.
The answer is yes; partly because of
the wonderful acting (more about
this later) and partly because of the
storyline, which barely exists. The
plot the writer wants to convey is a
mixture of short stories; situations
based around one guy or two. He
depicts a bunch of hopeless guys and
girls, and their way of living; it is
sometimes funny, or eye-opening, or
truly sad, or even all at the same time.
The message the writer is putting
across is not within a soft shell, but
– through the staging of the action –
bursts out in a non-fearful way.
That being said, the storyline and
the characters could be enhanced.
There was – I found – perhaps
too much in terms of swearing
or fighting, making it difficult to
find a character with whom one
could sympathise. But this must be
attributed to the ruthlessness and
the candidness of the play and is a
consequence of its topic. If you want
to see a romantic fairy tale with your
loved one as a Christmas treat, this
play might be one to avoid.
But if you are bored with the
mainstream theatre, and want
something innovative, special and
modern, you have just found it here.
The play is definitely funny, if you
are able to stomach its novelty; what
makes the story a lot more involving
is Vaughan-Lawlor’s amazing acting
(and it wasn’t just me that thought
this – one lady used that term at
least five times afterwards to express
her admiration), the fast dance-like
movements, the really skilful use of
tone, and the mysterious lightning,
which combine to make the drama,
the action and the whole story lively
and irresistibly involving – despite
the fact that there is only one man on
the stage. Due to Vaughan-Lower’s
strong presence you start to feel you
know the characters, you grasp the
plot and, by the end of the play, the
story is your own.
Howie the Rookie runs at The
Pit Theatre at Barbican, until 29th
November. Tickets are £18 for adults.
students can gain a discount through the
Young Barbican scheme.

Nothing Is Impossible
Neil Gaiman is possibly the most
quotable living person. In his“Make
Good Art”speech in Philadelphia
two years ago he gave a rousing
encouragement to young practicing
creatives,and his take on some
of today’s art practices.He also
came up with about 10 epiphanic
lines;“make glorious and fantastic
mistakes”;“do the stuff that only
you can do”;…you have no idea what
you are doing.This is great.”
As inspirational/soppy as this may
seem to you,I’d like to talk about
one in particular.It goes like this:
“The rules on what is possible and
impossible in the arts were made
by people who had not tested the
bounds of the possible by going
beyond them.And you can.”
I think this is an important one,
because it’s precisely the attitude
that you need as a young creative to
make something new that is true to
your abilities.An open mindedness
to new things.
Consider that the Impressionists,
Turner,Van Gogh,and many other
huge canonical art igures were
scoffed or thought little of in their
lifetimes.But even more than this–
because fame and even widespread
critical acclaim I don’t think are
the end-goal of an artist–think of
the mindset of anyone you know
who has made something actually
interesting.
For example,my sister and I love
the band Elbow,and we’ve been to
see them twice.Last week for my
birthday she surprised me with a
T-shirt on which she’s painstakingly
drawn some of their lyrics,and a
flock of starlings,and on the back
the logos of the O2 Arena and Echo
Arena.
Or think of the early Youtubers,
who in’07 and’08 realised that
talking into a camera for four
minutes was more engaging than
almost all of television.Think of
making up your own chemical
symbols because the originals
are rubbish.Think of the“Notes
to a Fresher”series that Felix ran
last year–short creative pieces by
Imperial Horizons students.
Think of the artist Ben Wilson
who paints miniscule images onto
the blackened chewing gum on
the Millennium Bridge (Seriously,
Google it).
Think of an arts magazine that you
can literally walk through–huge
pages of drawings and video and
poetry-that’s the idea for Roulade,
the magazine co-edited by artist and
poet Llew Watkins who is speaking
at Imperial next Wednesday.His
work and interests are thoroughly
interdisciplinary,and his sculptures
often exist only temporarily.
These peoples’mindset is that
they have this thing,this idea,and
they assess it based on merit,based
on how well it’s going to do the
thing they want to do.And then
they do the thing.
Responding to the world around
you in an honest and open manner
I think is crucial to making things.
It’s important to know what other
people have made,but it’s really,
really important to know that what
other people have made does not
in any way deine what you can or
can’t make.There are no criteria.
There are no rules.If it’s interesting
to you,it’s worth making.
