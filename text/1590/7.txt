Imperial College A Cappella
Society has been chosen to
host the UK semi-finals of
the International Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA),
presented by Varsity Vocals. The
competition, now in its 20th year,
was featured in the 2012 film Pitch
Perfect, which introduced the world
to the now widely known ‘Cups’. The
sequel has been confirmed for release
in 2015.
On January 24th, 2015, eight a
cappella groups from UK universities
will compete to win a place at the
International Final, to be held in
New York City.
This is the first time that there
has been a round held outside of the
USA, although video entry has been
allowed since 2012. The event will
be organised by Matthew Shirer, the
ICCA Overseas Producer at Varsity
Vocals.
Although the A Cappella Society
is hosting the event, Varsity Vocals
initially contacted the individual
groups separately regarding the
use of the Great Hall. There were
some issues with getting the space
for a reasonable price, with Henry
Harrod, the A Cappella Society Chair,
describing the situation as “pretty
heated in that respect”.
Following close to four weeks of
negotiation on the price, Henry was
on the phone to Varsity Vocals to
cancel the College’s participation
in the event, when Campus Services
offered a discount.
“As I was sitting there, I got
the email through from Charles
[Gallagher, Head of Hospitality and
Events], at the very last minute, and…
ICCA’s accepted over the phone.”
Three of the eight groups
competing are London-based.
Imperielles, The Scopes and The
Techtonics all perform regularly
and have previously competed in
The Voice Festival UK (VFUK), the
UK version of ICCA, The Techtonics
reaching the final in 2014. This will
be the first time that Imperielles
and The Scopes have competed at a
national competition.
All the King’s Men, from
King’s College London, round out
the London-based groups, with
four further groups coming from
Birmingham, Durham, and Exeter.
All of the teams perform regularly,
including visits to the Edinburgh
Fringe Festival, and many have
placed in national competitions.
Entries to the competition were
by video audition, to be submitted
by 15th November. A successful
audition would give a place in the
College-hosted semi final, at the hefty
price tag of £200 – double that of an
entry to VFUK.
The three groups who chose to enter
filmed their audition videos in the
recently renovated West Basement
studio, with Media groups assisting
with lighting and sound. Henry
acknowledged “teething problems”,
with this being one of the first times
the Studio had been used in anger,
but pointed out that all three groups
that auditioned had been selected to
compete. Take Note, the society’s
other all-female barbershop group,
chose not to enter.
The Deputy President (Clubs &
Societies) and the Deputy President
(Finance & Services) have already
confirmed their attendance at the
event, and other major figures on
campus will be invited, including
Charles Gallagher, the campus official
who sent the eleventh hour email that
saved the event.
The event will also feature a guest
performance from Birmingham
University’s Sons of Pitches, who
competed at the 2013 ICCA Final in
New York.
They have since gone semi-
professional, having released
their debut EP, Not Too Shabby in
December 2013. Despite this, they
continue to compete, singing against
The Techtonics in the VFUK final
last year.
A Cappella Society was founded in
November 2010 and now comprises
four groups, with two more in the
works. Each of the groups has a
different style, and all maintain
a set to be performed over the
year. Multiple groups are working
on recording releases, with The
Techtonics aiming to release a single
close to Christmas, and an album in
August 2015.
All of the groups have expressed
their excitement, with Peter Noden
(The Techtonics Chair) describing it
as “the opportunity to perform and
meet with the best of the British and
global a cappella communities”.
Imperial: Prepare to get Pitch-Slapped
Ben Howitt on the International singing competition to be hosted at Imperial
A representative from The Scopes
said:
“We’re so honoured to be
competing in the first ever UK
ICCA’s Semi-Final and it being held
at Imperial was just an added bonus!
We can’t wait to see the other groups
perform and to show the judges and
the local crowd what we’ve been
working on!”
The movement of A Cappella to
the UK has been a slow one, but the
addition of a true international
competition is a big step in the right
direction.
We here at Felix wish the
competing groups the very best of
luck, and hope that the competition is
appropriately aca-awesome.
