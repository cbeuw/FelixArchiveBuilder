A recently published study of his
investigates the effect of LSD on
imaginative suggestibility; he would
read out a script asking volunteers to
imagine, with eyes closed, a succession
of sensory experiences, like eating a
juicy orange or smelling freshly cut
grass. “[Volunteers] fall into a fantasy
state where they are imagining what I
am suggesting,” he says.
When they asked participants to
rate the vividness of the experience,
the extreme being it was just like
reality, the participants of the study
that had the LSD treatment rated it
as significantly more vivid compared
to control. Without needing hypnosis
or any authoritarian commands, LSD
induced a state of plasticity in the
volunteers’ perception of the world,
indicating big potential for use in
psychotherapy.
However, it remains a territory that
some people from a strict medical
perspective might question. “There is
this psychological element that some
people might find too qualitative and
abstract. But you just have to look at
the placebo effect to see how effective
it can be,” Carhart-Harris explains.
ADDICTIONS
Alongside apparent heightened
suggestibility, Carhart-Harris’
research indicates that LSD could
help with the treatment of addictions
and depression. “Ordinarily when
we experience the world, we do so in
such a constrained manner...habits
and routines we have are all about
digging certain channels in a way that
we slip into,” he says. “Psychedelics
start to fill in those channels that have
already been dug out so that they are
shallower and you can start falling
into different channels.”
This happens not just on a
metaphorical level but also mirrors
what Carhart-Harris has found in
changes of brain activity. “Brain
activity is governed to a large extent
by important hub structures that are
important for governing the channels
of activity that the brain supports,
and to some extent constraining the
circuitry of the brain. What we see
with LSD and other psychedelics is
that these hub structures are affected
and their activity is disturbed, which
seems to allow the brain to work in an
unconstrained manner. Cognition can
be more flexible and to some extent
broader as connections can be formed
between regions that are ordinarily
not connected or weakly connected, so
we see this heightened plasticity and
intercommunication within the brain
that we would not see ordinarily,” he
explains.
Using psychedelics to disrupt
reinforced patterns on the brain in
people with addictions or depression
could introduce a suppleness of the
mind, where new things can be learnt
whilst old things are unlearnt. A
recent study in the United States into
psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and
tobacco addiction, found that 80% of
smokers treated with psilocybin, with
the intention of giving up cigarettes,
abstain from smoking 6 months after
the treatment, a better result than the
current best treatment for tobacco
addiction.
“I have a strong conviction that
[psychedelics] will develop into
therapeutics in the coming decades,”
Carhart-Harris says.
HALLUCINATIONS
Out of interest, I thought I’d pick the
doctor’s brain on his theory behind
the manifestation of hallucinations
while under the influence of
psychedelic drugs. These phantom
visions have historically played a
huge role in mysticism, the history of
religion and the religious experience.
“I don’t have a really good
explanation for hallucinations, but
we have some clues,” he says. “One
explanation I could offer is that the
brain holds priors or predictions
about what it is going to be given in
terms of sensory information. We
come into this world with some innate
information about what the world
will be like, but you also develop an
incredible amount of knowledge about
how the world is and this develops
over time so that we can process the
world much more accurately and
precisely.
What you see with psychedelics
is that these priors and predictions
start slipping into conscious when
not induced,” he clarifies. “Essentially
what you are seeing under LSD is the
brain itself, the information that the
brain already holds is slipping into
our normal consciousness.”
DMT
“There are always drugs we would
like to look at, but are unable to
because of limited resources and
prioritising research” Carhart-Harris
says when asked if there were any
other psychedelics he would like
to investigate apart from LSD and
psilocybin.
“An interesting one is N,N-
dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which
occurs endogenously within the
human body and in other organisms,
and is prevalent in the plant world.
It is amazingly similar in molecular
structure to other chemicals present
within the body that do important
things in terms of psychology, like
serotonin for example,” he says.
There are many wild and wonderful
theories surrounding DMT and
people have theorised that it may be
responsible for certain endogenous
psychedelic, mystical-type experiences
and how these arise in certain
circumstances such as near-death.
“I’m not sure I agree, it’s good to keep
an open mind… but there is another
theory that is more intuitively
appealing – that states of naturally
occurring psychosis, when people go
‘mad’ so to speak, is due to endogenous
psychedelic-like compounds being
released in the brain, DMT is the main
candidate for that – but there is no
evidence.”
In order to get some conclusive
backing for this theory, researchers
would need to carry out a spinal tap
and analyse the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) to give a good index of what’s
in the brain in someone in a state of
acute psychosis. “Some of the best
studies that would really crack a
problem, are simply not feasible,”
Carhart-Harris says.
Psychedelic research is still very
young, but seems to be an incredibly
fertile domain and on the up. Of
course, these compounds are to be
treated with caution and Carhart-
Harris’ research is carried out under
carefully controlled settings. “The
dangers with psychedelics arise when
they are taken without the proper
caution,” he says.
For many drugs the decisions to
classify them under Schedule I in the
current UK drug legislation was made
before modern scientific methods
allowed a more comprehensive
understanding of their pharmacology
and toxicology. As a result, drugs were
lumped into groups not based on any
consideration of their physical harms
but on the assumption they had no
therapeutic value.
By breaking the 50 year taboo
surrounding psychedelics in research
and confronting the mysterious
with honest scientific methods, Dr
Robin Carhart-Harris and his team of
researchers have found evidence that
contradicts this assumption.
processes are underlying common
psychopathologies. “It is under
appreciated by mainstream
psychology and cognitive
neuroscience quite how important
and useful psychedelic drugs can be
for explaining the mind,” Carhart-
Harris says.
“Psychedelics are powerful scientific
tools, in order to understand any
phenomenon, a powerful strategy is to
perturb the phenomenon, which LSD
does.”
