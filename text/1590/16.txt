The more I read about this product
the more I wanted it. It’s not clear
from the name but it is described as a
‘personal physical activity monitor’
and in a nutshell it tracks how you’re
exercising and sleeping. It has a
simple circular LED display which
monitors your heart rate for different
activities (cycling, football, running
etc). It can double as a watch when
MisMisit Flash
required and runs on replaceable
batteries which last up to six months.
It can be found for less than £50
online and is a bargain considering
how relatively new the market is to
this type of technology.
2014: a monumental year for tech, bu
Smartphones
Laptops/Tablets
Gaming
Apple iPad Air 2
It has been claimed by some as
“the best tablet ever made”and
when you consider you can pick up
the 16GB version for about £350 it
is very good value too.It took on a
very good tablet in its predecessor
and improved the processor and
camera whilst also introducing a
ingerprint sensor.
In the quest for thinness,Apple
had to sacriice the side switch
which started a few teething issues
with its users but this has not
detracted from their achievement.
Onboard is a 1.5GHz triple-core
CPU,a total of 2GB of RAM and a
If you fancy something different
this Christmas then maybe a
Chromebook is for you.
Data is not really intended to
be stored on the device,but a
16GB solid-state drive is part of
the package with an extra 100GB
provided on Google Drive for free
for two years.It runs on Google’s
own OS and doesn’t have the
snazziest of specs.
What this computer lacks in
toys,it makes up for in comfort
and design.It’s easy to type and
move the cursor with the trackpad
and is as stylish as Apple laptops.
It has a standard 13.3 inch screen
Toshiba Chromebook
and,like the Air,works with a
1.4GHz processor.
Another pro is the battery life
which will give you about 7 hours of
Apple MacBook Air 13 inch 2014
The Air is back again and although
there have only been a few tweaks
on previous iterations,this version
of the MacBook looks like one of
the best laptops you can buy today.
Its main selling point is its battery
life,going for about 10 hours
depending on the display mode.
It comes with an i5 processor
runinng at 1.4GHz and 4GB of
RAM.The design is much the same
as before (not many people will
argue that they are unattractive)
but what you lose out on to other
laptops is the relatively poor
quality of screen,but igures such
as contrast ratio and sRGB colour
space coverage are those which
are going to be critiqued by the
keenest of eyes.At just under £700,
the Air is a bit pricy compared to
7340mAh capacity battery which
will give you about 10 hours of work
or play.Even more impressive are
its dimensions-a 9.7 inch screen
on top of 6.1mm of well-crafted
technology.I feel a few of these
are going to end up under the
Christmas tree next month.
Also worth a look...
TheSurfacePro3 reviewed by
Osama Awara in issue 1586,
probably established itself as the
best‘lablet’you can buy (which will
set you back about £1250 for the
whole tablet + keyboard package).

“Honey, I think we need to talk. I
think we need a new addition to the
family. I think we need a Wii U”. This
pleading will probably manifest in at
least one home this Christmas time.
It may or may not have something
to do with the recent release of Super
Smash Bros. for said console. Yes, it
will definitely be a nostalgia-gasm
but the problem is about ten people
in the country own the console. So
go on… be a hero! Get a Wii U so
your friends can come round your
house and continually humiliate you
with Pikachu. And while you’re at
it, get the Gamecube adapter so they
can bring their own controllers and
pummel you even more. I promise
it’ll be fun. You can pick up an 8GB
Wii U online for less than £170 and a
Gamecube controller adapter for less
than £18.

Aorus X7 V2–If Santa has won
your local lottery recently and you
like gaming you might want to
consider this beast.With a CPU
that can be clocked at 3.6GHz and
16GB of RAM,this is considered
to be a modern masterpiece of
computer engineering.However,
with a price tag of £1729,this writer
would recommend building a very
competent desktop for the same
amount or even less.
Google Nexus 6
The Nexus 6, the successor to the
much celebrated Nexus 5, is here and
its bigger and better than ever. Now
manufactured by Motorola, with an
improved 2.7GHz quad-core CPU, a
massive 5.96 inch AMOLED display,
the option of 64GB of memory and
a 12 megapixel rear camera, I believe
this device is going to sell very well
this Christmas. The significant size of
the phone means it can accommodate
a large battery (3220mAh) and its
Quick Charge technology means it can
operate for six hours after just fifteen
minutes of charge. It also comes with
Qi wireless charging which is the
icing on the cake for this state-of-the-
art device. It comes out of the box
with the newly released Android 5.0
Lollipop OS but at just under £500 for
pre-order, it is expensive compared to
its predecessors.
Apple iPhone 6 Plus
So if you have an iPhone, but either
the screen is smashed beyond repair
or you feel you need a bigger screen
to look at pictures of cats or watch
videos of cats… the iPhone 6 Plus
is the probably the phone for you.
It comes standard with a 1.4 GHz
dual-core CPU, a 5.5 inch Retina HD
display, a 8 megapixel rear camera
and its battery holds 2915 mAh, so it
may seem inferior to the new Nexus.
regular use.You can pick this up
for less than £220 online,making
this one of the best budget
laptops available.
other laptops with similar specs
but that won’t stop them flying off
the shelves.
