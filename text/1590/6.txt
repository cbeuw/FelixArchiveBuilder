Blackboard crashes during test
Thomas Lim reports as 450 students are left “confused and frustrated”
Last Thursday 450 students were
left confused and frustrated
after Blackboard crashed during
a Business Economics online. The test
was scheduled to start at 18:00, and
within ten minutes, students started
reporting issues with their tests, such
as images and formulae not loading
as expected. Shortly afterwards,
Blackboard went down.
Course Lecturer Dr Ralf Martin
emailed students immediately
afterwards, telling them he was
“super furious”. He told students
they had received “multiple
assurances” that Blackboard would
be able to handle the number
of students running the test
simultaneously. Dr Martin made
his opinions very clear to students,
telling them in another email “I can
only speculate that their [College
ICT’s] server is so badly managed
that it cannot handle 450 students.”
Speaking to Felix about the
incident, he said, “I wasn’t personally
promised that someone from ICT
would be present but it took them a
long time to respond, we still haven’t
had a formal response. We couldn’t
reach anybody until reach anybody
until several days after.”
Dr Martin was also unimpressed
with apparent issues with Web
Browser compatibility, citing other
tests that had issues due to students
using Google Chrome instead of
Firefox or Internet Explorer, leading
him to tell students, “Chrome is not
some weird exotic browser. Almost
every lecture I would spend saying
not to use chrome but maybe that
was not the reason.” The lack of
contact from ICT with Dr Martin
has left him confused and still trying
to understand why it had failed.
He speculated that smaller courses
have used Blackboard successfully
with Chrome, so it was more likely
an issue with the total number of
students taking the test.
In an email to Directors of
Undergraduate Studies who have
students enrolled on the course,
Edina Hamzic-Maguire of the
Business School told colleagues that
the outage did in fact not register on
College ICT systems. The Business
School were also told by ICT that
the “test will be recorded in the
team calendar and someone may
be available out of hours to trouble
shoot”. When it came to the evening,
a phone call to ICT was made, but
it went straight to a standard out of
hours message. ICT later told the
Business School that no staff were
available to be on standby past 18:00.
Students found the cancellation
and subsequent rescheduling of
the test inconvenient, one saying,
“It is extremely inconvenient for
me as I both have interviews and a
funeral abroad in the coming weeks,
meaning that I will not have much
time at all to refresh everything
which I studied for the test.” and
another adding “It’s all very well
saying that all we did is “study the
material of a module you signed
up for,” but the fact is that if there
hadn’t been the blackboard test I
would not have chosen to prioritise
my time towards this module. The
fact that I did so at the detriment of
my other modules, job applications,
and extra-curricular activities,
only to find the test cancelled, is
extremely inconvenient.”
The Business School have received
praise for taking students’ views into
account when deciding how best to
proceed, something most students
believe is unique to the Business
School. “The business school have
done a good job in considering
what’s best for students. An online
survey for the best way to deal with
the situation is something most
departments wouldn’t do, and giving
two different dates to do a test isn’t
something I’ve heard of before.”
An Imperial College Spokesperson
was keen to point out Blackboard’s
track record of reliability, issuing
the statement: “The College regrets
that an online Business Economics
test scheduled for the evening of
13 November had to be terminated
due to a technical problem
with Blackboard – the College’s
virtual learning environment –
through which the test was being
administered. Affected students
were polled on when the test
should be re-run and, to minimise
inconvenience, two alternative dates
will be offered.
“Advance checks showed no issues
with Blackboard, which has proven
a reliable system for the College,
with 99.99% service availability
between Oct 2013 and Oct 2014.
Unfortunately on this occasion, an
unforeseen problem occurred.
“ICT is working closely with the
Business School and the supplier
of Blackboard Learn to determine
the cause of the issue and to reduce
the risk of a future outage to the
e-Learning System. The College is
grateful for the input of affected
students who have been invited to
share what they experienced when
attempting to use the system during
the test.”
Planning for the test to be done
again is underway. In order to reduce
the stress and inconvenience to
students, two different times will be
available: one before Christmas, and
the other after.
The Business School have decided
not to use Blackboard for the retests,
instead load testing alternative
software.
