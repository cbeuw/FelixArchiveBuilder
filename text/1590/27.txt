Enforcing the Law: Simulator Style
MAXIMILIAN EGGL
SECTION EDITOR
Recently Felix Games was
offered a steam key to Enforce:
Police Crime Action, to test
and try out, review and break! And
that is exactly what we have done.
A little overview; Enforcer is a “life-
simulator” game, with an emphasis
on the police force side of things. You
are a police officer, starting out in a
new little mountain town, and the
aim is to advance your career in the
force with the ultimate goal of being
the chief. However, in addition to this
you can also live your life, designing
your home, having fun with your pals
and visiting the town. Lastly since
this game is a simulator, everything
is done with hyperrealism (as far as
possible). Right now the game is in
beta, so lots of features are currently
unimplemented and there are still
lots and lots of bugs.
When I was offered this game I was
super excited. I get to play as a police
officer (maybe rampage a bit, GTA
style), as well as do some of that stuff
that makes the Sims so fun. However,
almost never playing any simulator
games I did not know exactly what to
expect.
I jumped into the game as Frank
(the most generic policeman name
ever!), and saw how efficient the
existing police force was in my town.
After pulling out my sub-machine
gun and gunning down some people,
I came to the conclusion that they
were pretty useless. No sirens, no calls
not even the bystanders seemed to
care! Hmm, I definitely would not be
relying on my colleagues here. So I
promptly changed into my uniform
and started policing. As I drove my
car into town, I immediately got a
call to pick up a drunk who had been
"This is a
game about
decisions,
and how
each
decision
we make
affects
both us
and those
around us."
"Your ex
is now
getting
married
halfway
across the
country in
a month.
So what do
you do?"

causing problems. After scanning
my HUD I realised that I could find
this menace on the minimap. And
So I did. However, midway through
my handling of this rowdy character
I was called in to take care of some
murderer who was wondering the
streets. I had to make the hard
decision which one was the bigger
menace to society, and in the end I
decided that the drunkard definitely
could cause more harm (also I was like
right next to him so…yeah). However,
when I tried to apprehend him
and send him to the can, the game
crashed. Maybe the game judged me
on my ethics?
Oh well, so I started the game up
again and tried to make the good
choices. This time I was trying to
arrest some woman who had stolen
from the bank. Not only did I end up
chasing her for about a mile, the game
ended up crashing once again when
I tried to send her to jail. So it wasn’t
my choices!
The experience of the constant
crashing really ruined the game for
me, especially since it was one of the
major mechanics of the game that
caused the crash, meaning that I
almost couldn’t play.
So presently I am pausing the game
and waiting for it to be in a better
state before I play it again. Currently,
the AI is quite stupid, there are quite a
few bugs and lots of crashing. I mean,
the potential is definitely there. I felt
really badass (yes okay I know I am
sad) when I was breathalysing people
and giving them tickets, but on the
other hand I couldn’t really send
them to jail because the game would
then crash.
So I would advise y’all, as much as
you love simulator games, to wait this
one out. The game will be awesome,
but not in its present state.
