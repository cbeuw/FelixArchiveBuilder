Pebble Steel
Smartwatches are coming into the
mainstream and the technology
owes a lot to Pebble.The Steel
is elegantly designed and gets
its name from its stainless-steel
casing which protects the 1.36
inch black-and-white display.It
doesn’t discriminate between
phone makers; with its interface
compatible with both iOS and
Android.With a battery life of up to
5 days and currently being sold at
£165 this watch is an absolute steal.
Paul Balaji reviewed this piece of
kit last week and his impressions
were mostly positive.He was
particularly impressed by the
1.56 inch LCD screen and its sleek
design.It comes with different
coloured straps and bodies giving
it a personalised feel and running
Android Wear allows great options
for the default clock interface.
Its optical heart-rate monitor,
pedometer and water resistance
make this a solid buy at under
£200 (RRP,seemingly more at the
moment online).
Moto 360
LG G Watch R
What differentiates the LG G
Watch R from its competitors is
its appearance.It boasts a 1.3 inch
circular P-OLED screen and looks
like a chunky Citizen watch at
irst glance rather than a typical
smartwatch.Like the Moto 360,
it runs on Android Wear but it
processes tasks with a whopping
1.2GHz CPU (which can currently
only be matched by the Asus
ZenWatch).At under £220,the LG
looks on par with its competitors
for value,but unless its design
suits you,I would give it a miss.
Coming next year...
The Apple Watch,arriving guns-
a-blazing to the soundtrack of
a new mediocre U2 album,the
Apple Watch looks the perfect
accompaniment to your new
iPhone 6 or 6 Plus.
(Due Spring 2015)
The Samsung Gear S. With a
plethora of new features including
a massive 2 inch curved screen,an
accelerometer and a gyroscope,
when the Gear S (right) arrives it
will likely be the best smartwatch
you can buy.(Due Early 2015).

I watched a South Park episode
recently which lampoons the use of
drones and depicted how they could
be misused by the public on a grand
scale, resulting in the need for police
drones and culminating in riots
between the police and public drones
controlled from the comfort of your
bed. As I was watching I was just
assuming that a decent drone with a
camera would cost you hundreds of
pounds but with a quick search on
Amazon I found that you can get one
for less than £35!

However, it is a very attractive piece
of kit and it runs smoother than
most of its competitors. At £660 it is
probably not feasible to buy this for a
family member or a significant other,
but for yourself it could be a cracking
investment.
Moto G 4G
One of the hottest budget
smartphones you can buy right
now, at under £145 the Moto G is
a fabulous device for the money.
Unfortunately, the 4G iteration is
only available with 8GB of memory
but the Moto G has many qualities
which put it on a level playing field
with the rest.
The second generation G (released
September this year) has a 1.2GHz
quad-core processor, a sizeable 5
inch display and like the 6 Plus, an 8
megapixel camera. Its size limits the
battery to a capacity of 2070mAh,
lasting about a day of heavy use.
However, for such a reasonable
price, this is almost (as Kevin Bacon
would say) a no-brainer.
Also worth a look...
OnePlus One it may be the new kid
on the block but its earned a lot of
plaudits this year despite beginning as
an invite-only product. It costs under
£260 for the 16GB model.
The Sony Experia Z3 Compact offers
everything from its predecessor apart
from a full HD screen. It’s perfect for
Playstation 4 owners with the PS4
Remote Play feature but also good all
round in the smartphone department.
The Z3 can be found for under £330
online.
