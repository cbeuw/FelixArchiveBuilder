Earlier this month, the author
Saladin Ahmed wrote on
Twitter “the fantasy vision of a
medieval Europe devoid of people of
colour isn’t realism. It’s a different
word that starts with ‘r’ and ends with
‘ism’.”
I’ve always been interested in art,
and in all of those years of admiring
Renaissance and Medieval artworks,
the thought that I was not seeing
the whole picture never occurred
to me. The absence of art depicting
people of Asian and African descent
in European art history seemed
to me more an artefact of the
lack of globalisation rather than
the erasure of existing artworks
because they don’t fit in with our
preconceived ideas of Medieval and
Renaissance society. But even my
most rudimentary of research has
shown me that people of colour have
been depicted throughout European
art history, often as any other citizen
would have been, at all strata of
society; yes, as slaves, but also as
courtiers, nobility and men and
women of wealth and power.
These artworks are not even as
obscure as one might imagine, often
the true story lies in looking closer at
familiar works of art and recognising
what is already there. The Garden
of Earthly Delights – the triptych
painting by the Dutch master
Hieronymous Bosch dates from the
late 15th
century; three oak panels,
it depicts a scene from Genesis,
showing amongst others things, the
presentation of Eve to Adam by God.
It has been heaped with praise and
even inspired Joan Miro and Salvador
Dali; but what art history books fail
to mention is the incorporation of
not one but at least 17 figures that
are clearly of African descent in
addition to many others of different
skin tones. This highlights the power
that erasure and miseducation
holds; because we have been taught
not to expect it, we often dismiss it
altogether.
People of colour (who were
definitely not enslaved) have
been incorporated into tableaux
throughout European art history –
there are black bystanders in Liberale
da Verona’s work Dido’s Suicide, an
Ethiopian envoy forms part of one of
Carlo Saraceni’s frescoes created in
1617. Scenes depicting the adoration
of the magi have always shown at
least one king of the three to be a
man of Middle Eastern or African
descent. These depictions range
from Spanish paintings to Italian
frescoes to German wood cuttings,
showing that Europe has always been
a place that people of all nationalities
and skin colour have travelled to,
worked and settled in. The idea of a
completely white Europe simply has
never existed.
So if this art has always existed,
why is it not taught in our schools?
Why do we as children grow up
with an idea of Renaissance and
Medieval society as one that is deeply
segregated? Evidence suggests that
this may have more to do with the
influence of the 18th and 19th art
historians than historical truth.
Take for instance the case of the
Black Madonnas of Europe. Over 450
‘Black Virgins’ exist across Europe,
including those attributed to Saint
Luke who is said to have painted his
copies from life – a dark skinned
Virgin Mary from an African or
Middle Eastern background. What
is striking is that accounts of these
pieces do not hint that contemporary
viewers found her anomalous in any
way, simply referring to her as ‘Our
Lady’ without comment on skin hue.
It is only in the 18th or 19th
century that these were seen to need
explanation, the perceived darkening
of skin tone was attributed to an
accumulation of smoke, careless
handling by worshippers and
deterioration of pigment. These
theories have now mostly been
debunked, showing that hues would
have deteriorated to a distinctly
Martian green as opposed to the
brown of darker skin.
In the 18th and 19th century
many of these were painted over,
including the statue of Mother and
Child in Tindari, Sicily with its Latin
inscription “nigra sum, sed formosa [I
am dark, yet beautiful]”. ‘Explanations’
for Robert Campin of Flémalle’s
1410 St Veronica painting with its
dark skinned Christ are never offered
up by artists of the time. It is only
in later centuries that we find art
historians trying to justify them as
by this time, colonialism had meant
darker skin tones were seen as of less
aesthetic value.
In From Majesty to Mystery: Change
in the Meanings of Black Madonnas
from the Sixteenth to Nineteenth
Centuries the anthropologist Monique
Scheer notes that “Johann Wolfgang
von Goethe also expressed a sense of
aesthetic disappointment in black
Madonnas in a comment from
1816: “How the most unhappy of
all appearances could have crept
Transforming Modern Perceptions of Medieval Art
Indira Malik explains how prejudices have clouded our appreciation of art
St Veronica by Robert Campin of Flémalle (1410)
in – that, probably for Egyptian or
Abyssinian reasons, the Mother
of God is portrayed as brown, and
the face of Our Saviour printed
on Veronica’s veil was also given a
Moorish colour – may be clarified
when that part of art history is more
closely examined.””
As modern viewers we need to
recognise that our perceptions of
history and art have often been
formed by people such as Goethe
whose racist and colonial views
have informed our idea of what was
‘normal’ in Medieval or Renaissance
Europe.
Art history may not seem like
a significant issue in the face of
on-going racial unrest. Only this
week, violent riots have resumed
in Ferguson, Missouri when state
prosecutors declined to bring charges
against officer Darren Wilson who
shot and killed Michael Brown, an
unarmed Black teenager. But, history
forms a large part of our identity and
the way we see the people around us.
In Black Indian: A Hidden Heritage,
William Lorenz Katz writes “If
you know I have a history, you will
respect me.” and the sentiment was
reflected by Chimamanda Ngozi
Adichie in her 2009 TED talk:
“Power is the ability not just to tell
the story of another person, but to
make it the definitive story of that
person. Show a people as one thing,
only one thing, over and over again,
and that is what they become“.
Representation is important; it is
imperative that the history of people
of colour in Europe does not become
tied wholly to slavery and that the
diverse heritage of Medieval Art is
not lost in the tired trope of racism
weakly disguised as ‘historical
inaccuracy’.
The erasure of people of colour
from the narrative of Medieval art
is not only essential for the way we
relate to various groups of people
today but to the art itself. As the
famous Guerilla Girls piece reads,
“you’re seeing less than half the
picture without the vision of women
artists and artists of colour”. But this
could so easily refer to the art as well
as the artists. In his essay on art and
propaganda George Orwell wrote:
“every work of art has a meaning
and a purpose — a political, social
and religious purpose… our aesthetic
judgements are always coloured by
our prejudices and beliefs.”
It is important that we learn to
recognise our prejudice as artists
but also as modern critics; it is true
as Goethe writes that Medieval art
needs to be more closely examined,
but perhaps ultimately it reveals
more about our own ideas and
prejudices than it does about the
original artists.
"The
idea of a
completely
white
Europe
simply
has never
existed."
"... perhaps
ultimately
it reveals
more about
our own
ideas and
prejudices
than
it does
about the
original
artists"
