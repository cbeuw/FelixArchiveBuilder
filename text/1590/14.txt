Having Trouble Sleeping?

"Previously
sleep was
thought to
be a very
passive
state."
In the UK, 1 in 4 people suffer
from some form of sleep disorder
resulting in excessive daytime
sleepiness. Researchers at Imperial
College London, led by Professors
William Wisden and Nicholas Franks
of the Department of Life Sciences
and Dr Mick Hastings’ group at
the MRC Laboratory of Molecular
Biology in Cambridge, have shined
new light on exactly how the body
controls when you wake up and when
you fall asleep (the circadian rhythm).
The human circadian system
regulates the rhythm of the human
body by establishing normal
sleep and wake phases. During the
transition from wakefulness to
sleep, the brain gradually becomes
less responsive to visual, auditory
and other environmental stimuli
and relatively more responsive to
internal stimuli. We now understand
this transition better in terms of
the stages of sleep – stage I being
the most superficial and stage IV
requiring the most stimulation to
wake an individual; REM (rapid eye
movement) sleep is either considered
separately or as stage V sleep.
Previously, sleep was thought
to be a very passive state of
unconsciousness with decreased body
(especially brain) activity. Nowadays
we know that sleep serves a variety
of functions: from restoration and
recovery, to energy conservation,
metabolic replenishment of the brain
and even memory!
A ‘master clock’ found in
the hypothalamus called the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is
believed to be centrally involved
in synchronising many other ‘local
clocks’ that collectively modulate
our body’s state of activity. However,
until now, we were not able to
demonstrate the effects of these ‘local
clocks’ in the brain or explain the
mechanisms by which they influence
various areas.
In this experimental study on mice,
the contribution of one putative
‘local clock’ in histaminergic neurons
in the tuberomamillary nucleus
(TMN; lies outside the SCN) to the
regulation of the sleep-wake cycle was
tested. The underlying hypothesis
of this study was that histaminergic
neurones in the hypothalamus are
silent during sleep (i.e. they release
no histamine) and only start firing
after the onset of wakefulness. The
subsequently released histamine,
made by the enzyme histidine
decarboxylase (HDC), enhances
wakefulness by acting on areas of the
cerebral cortex.
The scientists selectively deleted a
well known ‘clock gene’ called Bmal1
from histaminergic cells in mice and
found that this led to higher levels of
HDC expression and subsequently
higher brain histamine levels
during the day. As a result of this,
the test mice had more fragmented
and shallower sleep, prolonged
wakefulness, hindered recovery after
sleep deprivation and even impaired
memory.
The researchers used
electroencephalography (EEG)
analysis to compare the levels of
brain activity during the sleep-wake
cycles in control mice (i.e. those with
the Bmal1 gene in the TMN) with
those mice bred with the gene deleted
(test mice).
Wakefulness and recovery from
sleep was assessed by placing pieces of
paper and plastic tubes in the mice’s
chamber to discourage sleep. It was
found that after 5 hours of sleep-
deprivation, the control mice had an
average of 6 hours more sleep than
the test mice. Memory was assessed
by observing the ability of the control
and test mice to recognise two
previously familiarised objects after
a fixed period of sleep deprivation
and a period of recovery. For both
groups of mice, sleep deprivation
impaired performance in recognizing
the objects; however, the test mice
performed worse and explored all the
In early September this year,a
36 year old woman made history
by giving birth to the world’s
irst womb-transplant baby.Ab-
solute uterine factor infertility,
caused by either an abnormal
or absent uterus,is considered
the only untreatable type of
female infertility.It affects many
women throughout the world,
some of whom have resorted
to other motherhood options
such as surrogacy and adoption.
Several uterus transplantations
have previously been attempted
but no live births have been
reported until recently,as part
of a groundbreaking clinical trial
led by Dr Matt Brannstrom of
the University of Gothernburg.
It has taken more than a decade
of intensive animal research by the
team of scientists before achieving
this goal.
The Swedish woman was 15 when
she was told that she would never
bear children of her own after being
diagnosed with Rokitansky syn-
drome,a congenital absence of the
uterus.The woman received the
uterus from a 61-year-old family
friend,and after in-vitro fertilisation
(IVF) treatment with her partner she
underwent a single embryo transfer
a year after the surgery.
Vincent was delivered prema-
turely at 31 weeks,He is normal and
healthy,much to the delight of his
parents and the research team.
Before this case became a proof-
of-concept for uterus transplanta-
tion as a treatment method for
absolute uterine factor infertility,
there were doubts as to whether a
transplanted uterus could provide
nourishment to the foetus,and
whether a post-menopausal womb
wowuld even work.Eight other
women are currently involved in
the transplantation trial and the
research team has recently an-
nounced that two more women are
pregnant having undergone the
same procedure.
Scientists have to consider the
ethical caveats that surround such
research,which has been described
as one that requires“greater ethi-
cal justiication than other organ
transplants”.Critics have questioned
whether the operation would be a
realistic option since it only seeks to
improve one’s quality of life rather
than being life-saving,yet it is
costly and fraught with many
health risks.However,advocates
believe it helps women to fulil
personal dreams of having a child
and developing a maternal bond
which could be missing from other
options,namely surrogacy.
This live birth has opened up
the possibility for treating women
with absolute uterine factor infer-
tility and is a reflection of the long
and challenging journey taken
by Dr.Brannstrom and his team.
“I want people to know that what
they think is impossible can hap-
pen,”said the new mother who
hopes that other women will be
encouraged and can tell the same
story in the future.

Dr Xiao Yu of Imperial College
London, lead author of the study,
expressed how “exciting [it is] to find
significant evidence of a local body
clock. Now we know that the master
clock is not working alone, but relies
on lots of helpers to wake up our
whole body”.
Furthermore, the next steps are
to investigate if there is a direct
link between the SCN and other
‘local clocks’ to decipher how sleep-
wake messages are interchanged.
Nonetheless, this study has helped
us to establish a platform to better
understand how circadian control
may be occurring in humans.
Hopefully, we are not far from
translating this understanding
into tangible benefits for patients
suffering from sleep disorders.
