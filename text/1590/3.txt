College to investigate
circumstances
surrounding
Professor’s death
Aprofessor from the Faculty of
Medicine, Professor Stefan
Grimm, was found dead in
September of this year in Northwood,
Middlesex.
Several colleagues of Professor
Grimm spoke to the Times Higher
Education (THE) and described how
he was under a lot of pressure at work.
They also said that he had been placed
under a performance review, and had
been unsuccessful in a number of
grant applications.
They told THE that Professor
Grimm had felt let down by Imperial,
and was not supported in the months
leading up to his death.
A College investigation is
ongoing into Professor Grimm’s
death, although no conclusions
have been drawn as of yet. The
college is conducting reviews of
the circumstances surrounding
the incident as a whole, including

addressing policies and procedures
relevant to the case. The review will
be done by the Director of Human
Resources at Imperial, accompanied
by the Senior Consul, Professor
Richard Thompson.
Any findings will then be reported
to a group of senior college staff, led
by the provost, who will then put into
place any recommendations deemed
suitable.
An Imperial College London
spokesperson told Fe¬lix that: “Stefan
Grimm was a valued member of the
Faculty of Medicine and news of his
death at the end of September came
as a great shock to colleagues. The
College has been in touch with his
family since his death to offer our
deepest condolences.
“At a time when family, friends,
colleagues and students are still
coming to terms with a death, it is
important to undertake any reviews
in a manner that respects these
sensitivities, and that does not create
a more difficult or challenging
environment for those people.”
This year’s University Challenge team inalised
The University Challenge team
has been finalised after an
extensive selection process. The
new team consists of 5 male students
and was selected after passing several
rounds of quizzes and a final trial
stage.
The team consists of three
undergraduate students and two PhD
students. Ben Fernando, a third year
physics student and Captain of last
year’s team, has made a reappearance
alongside James Bezer, a third year
physics student (and one of Felix’s
esteemed Science Editors).
New to the team is Ashwin Braude,
a fourth year physics student, and
Onur Teymur, who is working on a
PhD in statistics. Also joining them
is Patrick Dunn, who is a physics
student, also currently working on his
doctorate.
The selection process started a
few weeks ago, with quizzes held
by Imperial College Union in
conjunction with Quiz Soc. The
60-question test culled down 100
hopefuls to 16, who had a call-back for
the evening of Friday 21st November.
The final trial was a mock-up of
teams being questioned, Jeremy
Paxman style, and observed by
Imperial College Union President
Tom Wheeler and Student Trustee
Thomas Lim.
The 16 students were judged on
how they interacted as a team and
total scores were also taken into
consideration before the panel
decided on the final five.
The team will now have another
interview with the producers of the
show in January where they will be
asked more questions, and in the last
weekend in February filming will
commence in the Granada studios in
Manchester.
28 teams make it to the televised
finals.
Last year the team was knocked out
at the January stage, so did not make
it onto the screens of households
across the country.
The series is due to air during the
second half of August.

Imperial College returns to top of the
Research Council Grants Table
Imperial College has returned to
the top of the league table for
research council income for the
year 2013-14. It is the fourth time in
the last five years that the College has
topped the table, having been in third
place for the year 2012-2013.
In this edition of the league table,
Imperial was awarded £114 million,
an increase of £11 million on 2012-
13. This meant that the College was
one of only ten institutions that saw
an increase of more than £10 million.
University College London (UCL),
who were last year’s leaders, saw their
value of awards fall by 42 percent.
Cambridge saw their value diminish
by 45 percent, as it fell to fifth in the
rankings.
Donal Bradley, Vice-Provost
(Research), said that he was “delighted
to see the dedication and hard work of
our staff paying off in what remains a
difficult funding climate”.
Imperial was successful in only 29
percent of its applications, which,
when compared to other Universities
in the top ten, is quite low. However,
this means that Imperial’s value of
awards was significantly higher than
other Universities in the list.
Overall, the number of applications
went down from the College by 19
percent – the third largest decline
in the table. On the whole there has
been a large decline in the number of
applications. There were nine percent
fewer applications overall in 2013-14,
with only seven institutions actually
submitting more applications than in
the previous year.
Despite the drop in numbers of
applications, the success rate has
also dropped across the board. Only

seven out of the top 27 institutions
have seen their success rates increase.
Imperial’s rate is unchanged from
2012-13.
Behind Imperial in this year’s
table were Oxford, who had £94
million, UCL with £78 million
and Manchester with £58 million.
Cambridge, Bristol, Edinburgh, King’s
College London, Southampton and
Nottingham complete the top ten.

Imperial College London has won
the popular quiz show in previous
years; they beat London School of
Economics to the title in 1996, and
again in 2001, beating St John’s
College, Oxford.
