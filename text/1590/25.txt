Newest release: Binding or does it (I)saac?
Calum Skene on the sequel to one of the biggest indie successes
As a big fan of the original
Binding of Isaac I was very
happy to see that one of this
month’s Playstation Plus games
is the shiny new remake entitled
Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.
For people who haven’t played
the original, Binding of Isaac is a
game based on the biblical story
of Abraham and Isaac, except this
time its Isaac’s mum who is trying
to murder him. You play as Isaac
and must traverse through many
floors, each of which are randomly
generated each time, and defeat the
enemies with your tears. Each floor
contains many rooms and these
can contain monsters, treasure and
items. At the end of each floor you
must face off against a boss to open
the trapdoor to the next floor. Each
floor gets harder and harder but
this is balanced by the items you
find which serve to give you more
health, let you deal extra damage
and much more.
The main attraction of this game
is its rogue-like play style. Each
time you play the game you get
different items, face a different
layout and have to defeat different
enemies. Binding of Isaac is (at
least for me) a hard game where
on an average run I can do 3 or 4
levels but on a good run – which
is a mixture of skill and good luck
Jebediah Kerman
Day 1, Hour 4
It’s with a heavy heart and a
tear-tinged eye that the Kerbal
Space Centre has to announce the
passing of Captain Jebediah Kerman
this week, following a rapid and
slightly less-controlled-than-planned
landing of his space craft — The Ugly
Duck II — about 20 metres south of
the launch pad he had departed from
30 seconds beforehand.
Cpt J. Kerman had already
demonstrated his excellent flying
capabilities as pilot of the first ever
mission launched by the Kerbal
Space Program, the Ugly Duck I.
Jebediah was always first in line
for missions with the KSP based in
part on his enthusiasm, courage,
and default setting at the top of
the list as programmed into the
game. His tragic death was a freak
accident, inasmuch as the engineer
who designed the Ugly Duck II
had forgotten to check the staging
commands properly so that when
the main rocket engines fired, the
parachute deployed simultaneously,
Bill Kerman
Day 2, Hour 3
The Kerbal Space Centre regrets
to announce the death of
Commander Bill Kerman
after a spacewalk inadvertently went
completely bollocks up. Commander
B. Kerman had nobly stepped into
the shoes of Jebediah Kerman
(which miraculously had survived
the wreckage of the Ugly Duck II
disaster almost intact) and had been
the primary pilot of the subsequent
2 missions launched as part of the
Kerbal Space Program.
As commander of the Ugly Duck III
mission, Bill became the first Kerbal
to leave the atmosphere, reaching
a record height of 82,000 metres
above the surface of Kerbin. The
subsequent Ugly Duck IV mission
saw Bill become the first Kerbal to
achieve orbit. Or rather it would’ve
done if he hadn’t decided to let go of
the side of the spacecraft whilst on
EVA. Unfortunately ground-control
hadn’t actually noticed that Bill had
taken such a rouge action for quite
some time, as they were busy taking
screenshots for the KSP forum.
Questions are being asked about
ground-control’s attempts to rescue
Bill, as various commands sent to
his EVA suit saw him drift wildly
far away from the craft as there was
decided confusion as to whether or
not the shift key meant up or down.
By the time common sense
prevailed, Cmdr Kerman was 2km
away from his craft, and out of
monopropellant. Friends and family
have all taken solace in the fact that,
in death, as in life: Bill was too stupid
to realise what abject peril he was
constantly in.
In the irst of a weekly installment Matt Allinson mourns his brave Kerbals
destroying them and sending the
whole craft into an unrecoverable
spin. We can all take encouragement
knowing that Jebediah died doing
what he loved: experiencing 4 vertical
g and 6 lateral g whilst pointing
straight at the ground travelling at
140m/s. A true Kerbal Hero.

– I can do more. There is a steep
learning curve; beginners might
find it hard to get past the first level
but pro players can consistently
get to the end and defeat mum.
No matter what level of skill you
have with this game the random
elements of this game means that
there is aways a lot to see and
discover even in the early levels. As
you play more and improve you will
begin to recognise patterns in how
the game plays and get excited when
your favourite item pops up.
The ‘rebirth’ of the game takes
the flash-based original and makes
it what it always should have been.
The game now crashes less, has
an even more beautiful Edmund
McMillen art style and has about
100 new items. The game has been
left alone in all the right places
whilst also being improved and
expanded. Everything that was
already great and addictive about
this game is now even greater and
more addictive. Even players who
mastered the original game will
want the new version because of its
new hard mode (as if the original
wasn’t hard enough). The PSVita
version plays very well, controls
naturally and the nature of Binding
of Isaac means its perfect for a train
or bus journey.
Overall this game isn’t new but
it is definitely worth picking up
whether you are new to Isaac or
even if you’re an avid fan.
