Have your say
Union General Meeting
Monday 1 December, 18:30, Blackett
Lecture Theatre 1
We’ve had your feedback about Higher Education Funding, and now it’s time for YOU
to decide what your Union is going to do about it. We’re holding a General Meeting to
determine what our stance should be on tackling the issue of Higher Education Policy.
Should we be lobbying for…
Free Education Tuition Fees Graduate Tax or none of these?
This is your chance to help us try and shape the future of university funding for students
like you.
A General Meeting is also a chance to talk about anything, and you can submit a paper to
the Union Council Chair for a subject to be raised. Papers must be submitted by email to
chairman@imperial.ac.uk by Monday 24 November. You can find information about how
to write and submit a paper on our website.
