Imperial Athletics dominate
University of London Champs
On Sunday 23rd December,
Imperial College Cross
Country and Athletics club
along with the ICSM (Imperial
Medics) athletics club competed in
the annual University of London
championship at the Lee Valley
Athletics centre. Having (somewhat
unfairly) lost out to LSE last year in
the battle for the top spot, our team
was hungry for a chance to take back
the championship, which has been
won by Imperial for 10 out of the last
12 years.
It became apparent as the medals
started pouring in that this was our
year. By the end of the day we had
racked up a massive 12 gold medals,
10 silvers and another 9 bronze to
take the championships, pushing our
arch-rivals LSE down to 3rd place and
winning twice as many golds as 2nd
place UCL!
Star performances in the field came
from Stephanie Koumbas and Erik
Tropp who won gold in the high jump
with an all-Imperial podium in the
men’s. George Cross led an ICSM
dominated men’s shot put and Ines
Kubler revealed her hidden strength
to take gold for the women.
It was also the women who stole
the show on track. Fresher Alex
Mundell wowed the competition with
two golds in the 400m and 800m, a
sign of what we can expect over the
next 6 years! Final year medic Sian
Mitchell took gold in the 200m and
60m hurdles. However, the athlete of
the day has to be Emma Watkins who
could barely stand upright under the
weight of her 5 medals, including a
gold in long jump.
In a very tense men’s 60m final,
Chris Chung managed to edge
out James Roughneen and Sidney
Chan to win gold and complete an
impressive Imperial 1-2-3. Gareth
Holden faced an inopportune fire
alarm delaying the race start in
the men’s 400m but managed to
take home the silver medal. This,
of course, led to the inevitable fire
alarm selfies and a certain photo of
one Movember participant (who shall
remain nameless) that will surely not
be forgotten. In the much anticipated
relays, the Imperial women’s team
and the men’s 1st team claimed the
silver medals, both narrowly missing
out on gold.
Phil Hughes, Lewis
Hamilton, and SPOTY – the
World Sport Column
In the early hours of Thursday,
Australia batsman Phil Hughes
was pronounced dead at St
Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney. He had
been struck on the side of the head
by a bouncer from New South Wales
bowler Sean Abbott in a Sheffield
Shield match on Wednesday. In
response, Cricket Australia chose
to abandon the round of domestic
matches being played this week. They
also chose to cancel India’s warm-
up fixture ahead of the series in
Australia. Pakistan and New Zealand
chose to extend their test match by
a day and suspend play on Thursday
out of respect, while England and Sri
Lanka will have a minute’s silence
ahead of their match on Friday. An
obituary for Phil Hughes is on page
39.
In Formula 1 Lewis Hamilton won
the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at the
Yas Marina Circuit to win the World
Championship. Nico Rosberg, who
was the only person who could catch
Hamilton, was only able to finish
13th, after his car had power issues.

Of course, no athletics event would
be complete without the standard
club curry to round off a good day of
UCL-bashing. The real competition
of who could brave the vindaloo was
won by James Roughneen who didn’t
even break a sweat (almost). The
trophy proved to be the perfect vessel
for toasting our success and ensuring
sufficient levels of merriment all
round. The last leg of the day (pun
intended) involved a trip to Be at One,
Hammersmith where two for one
cocktails went down very well. This
rounded off what was a spectacular
day for Imperial Athletics and a
fantastic team performance to mark
record levels of participation! It’s not
too late to get involved in ICXCA,
there will be many more events in the
new year. Email run@ic.ac.uk or find
