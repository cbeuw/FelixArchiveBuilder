If you haven’t heard of Kendall
Jenner by now, then you
probably live under a rock. Her
face has been plastered on every
magazine cover, from the likes
of Vogue to the edgy Dazed and
Confused. She is part of the new
wave of social media powerhouse
models, with multiple selfies posted
on her instagram account – a de
rigueur daily ritual. Many will
know of her from her childhood
appearances alongside her sisters on
the hit US reality tv series, Keeping
up with the Kardashians. Despite the
fame she acquired from appearing
on the series, she was determined
to become a model from an early
age, without the Kardashian name.
In an intervew with Juju Chang on
Nightline, she explained that she
has worked hard towards achieving
her newfound succcess as a model,
saying “In reality I worked pretty
hard for this, running around
doing tests. It wasn’t like I just got
it magically.” When she was asked
why she wanted to become a model,
she said “I would always be looking
at these supermodels, they were
just so amazing to me, they were
like superheroes… I want to be some
little girl’s superhero. I want to the
best role model I can be to a little
girl or a little boy or to anybody.”
Interestingly, she has asked her
sisters not to attend her catwalk
shows, because she feels that this
would take the attention away from
her, especially if her uber-famous
sister Kim Kardashian West were in
attendance. Recently, in an attempt
to distance herself from her Keeping
up with the Kardashians persona,
she dropped her last name so that
she would be taken more seriously.
She said that she did this at all her
model castings last year, where she
only went by her first name. Kendall
enjoyed her big-break as a runway
model in September, for the Spring/
Summer 2015 fashion season, which
saw her walk the runway for 13
labels at New York, Milan and Paris
fashion weeks. Among some of the
big names she walked for were Diane
Von Furstenberg, Chanel, Givenchy
and Dolce and Gabbana. Her global
success as a fashion sensation has
only just began, and two weeks ago
she announced on her instagram
and twitter accounts that she would
be the new face of beauty cosmetics
brand Estee Lauder.
Kendall is not only a hugely
successful model, but she is also a
businesswoman, much like her older
sister Kim. With her sister Kylie
Jenner, she has launched a jewellery
line called ‘Metal Haven,’ a clothing
line called ‘Kendall and Kylie,’ sold
at US retailer Pacsun, as well as a
shoe and handbag collection for
Steve Madden. The budding model
has even ventured into writing, and
in 2014 released a novel co-authored
with Kylie called Rebels: City of Indra
(which was actually ghostwritten by
Maya Sloan).
Kendall has said that her
reputation as a reality tv star has
made it difficult for her to break
into the fashion industry, and she
has had to work a lot harder to be
taken seriously and build a career in
modelling.
With her recent rapid rise in
fashion, rumours about her life
have run rampant. Recently, it was
reported that fellow models were
mean towards her during fashion
week, would bully her backstage
and put their cigarettes out in
her drinks. However, in her latest
magazine interview with Dazed and
Confused, Kendall confirms that
these rumours are exactly just that:
rumours. In the issue, which hits
newsstands on the 27th
of November,
she said “Everyone’s been really
cool to me. I’ve never had one girl be
mean… so far.”
The rumours about her don’t just
stop at the runway either. Being
as famous as she is, she has been
romantically linked to many high
profile stars, including Justin Bieber,
Chris Brown, Harry Styles and
more recently, Dallas Mavericks
basketball player Chandler Parsons.
Earlier this month, Kendall
celebrated her 19th
birthday
at Chateau Marmont in West
Hollywood, where she re-united
with her close friend Selena Gomez.
The two were feuding after Kendall
had been spotted out to dinner with
Justin Bieber, Selena’s ex-boyfriend.
In a recent interview however,
Kendall set the record straight,
clarifying that her and Bieber
were in fact just very close friends.
Another rumoured frenemy, Cara
Delevingne, also attended the party,
ending rumours that the two are
feuding. Both Cara and Selena sang
happy birthday to Kendall.
So, what’s on the horizon for the
fashion sensation? The star will soon
be featuring as the new face of Karl
Lagerfeld’s own fashion label, and
it’s been rumoured that she may
replace Cara Delevingne as the face
of Chanel. This isn’t so implausible,
considering that Cara Delevingne
has announced that she will be
focusing more on her acting career
next year.
Kendall has compared her busy,
whirlwind year to living like
Hannah Montana. She told the
New York Times “It’s definitely two
different worlds. I feel like Hannah
Montana. But it’s fun.”
