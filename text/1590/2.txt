SKETT’S BOX OF SHAME
Apologies for a mistake in Issue
1589:
-We said last week that the London
Forum for Science on Policy “Can
Education Fix Britain’s Youth
Drinking Problem?” came with free
drinks. Awkward. Apologies.
This week, we have a
smorgasbord of content to keep
you busy in the library café as
you chow down on a jacket potato or
three, depending on how many hours
you are spending within the library
doing end of term coursework. There
may be three weeks left still, but it
seems work always begins to pile on at
this time of year.
In the news this week, we’ve looked
at the aftereffects of the sanctions
held against the Imperial Medicals:
the rugby team of ICSM who smashed
a coach window whilst on tour.
Despite vowing never to put the
rugby team of either IC or ICSM on
the front page again, here we are,
the third time in nine weeks. It is
an interesting case with opposing
opinions held by those involved.
When we initially persued the story,
we did not expect such lengthy and
in-depth responses from George
Cross, the Captain of the Medicals
and Tom Wheeler, one of the people
who approved of the sanctions in
the first place. However, they show
how there are two sides to every story
so we have printed both in their
entirety, so you can make your own
minds up on the matter.
We also have the more cheerful
news of the International A Cappella
competition making its way into our
Great Hall in January. Although I
have sadly been told Fat Amy will
not be making an appearance, I
have been reassured everything else
will basically be like the last twenty
minutes of the film Pitch Perfect.
I’ve put you on the front page guys: I
expect front row tickets in return!
After the success of our Science
last week, the section is still going
strong, with a great interview with
Imperial’s own LSD expert Dr Robin
Carhart-Harris alongside their usual
news pieces. We have a great spread of
Games this week which is catching up
with Arts, and Arts again have blown
it out the water with their topic this
week being transformation.
If none of that is of interest, we
have our usual puzzles, offensive
horoscopes and our Fresher is having
issues with his latest squeeze. If that
isn’t enough, we also have a double
centrefold spread, although we like to
think we are a bit better than Playboy
and you pick us up for the articles too.
There is only two issues left, but still
plenty of time to get involved. We are
looking to expand our news reporter
team, so if you fancy getting some
journalism experience and seeing the
office in all its festive glory, drop us a
lone at felix@imperial.ac.uk. We have
just invested in an office biscuit tin
and everything.
THIS WEEK’S EDITORIAL

The simultaneously best and worst advertising we have seen all week: props to
you ACC, and good luck with your Geeks and Freaks Bar Night next Wednesday at
the Union. Do that 2007 Word Art proud.
