Impotent student takes up sport
It was revealed to Hangman this
week that a student was left “upset
and confused,” after picking up
what he thought was a leaflet ad-
dressing erectile dysfunction. After
initially glancing at the subtitle “get
active, no hassle,” the anonymous first
year aeronautics student was hopeful
that finally he might get some infor-
mation on how to address his flagging
issue.
However, he was left
disappointed when upon closer
inspection he realised the leaflet
was actually advertising the
new Imperial Sport programme,
known as “Impetus.”
The scheme, that costs £30,
allows students to play sports
without the having to commit
and play in leagues. Sport
Imperial provides the scheme
for “competitive sports” such
as Table Tennis, and Ultimate
Frisbee.
Said the student, “I’ve been
worried about my little problem
for a while, and it seems to
be a common shortcoming
with a few of my friends. I was
Students steal CT scanner to
recover club costs
Sources have revealed to Hang-
man this week that a group
of men took a large piece of
machinery to a local Cash Converters
with hopes of receiving cash in hand.
Upon closer inspection it was found
to be a CT scanner, which was dam-
aged but still useable, although has
now been deemed a health hazard.
Although it is uncertain as to
where this CT scanner was sourced, it
coincides with Charing Cross hospital
reporting last Wednesday that one
of their own scanners had gone
missing. The scanner was seemingly
dismantled and carried out of the
building, in a manner that, according
to a mechanic “would imply those
removing the scanner has some crude
knowledge of medical machinery.”
CCTV was unable to capture the
culprits on camera, as those cameras
located in the vicinity were also
dismantled and removed too. The
same mechanic told hangman, “It was
like these culprits had experience with
this sort of crime: the latest footage to
be recovered shows a group of men,
semi-naked, approaching the camera
with an apparent look of apprehension
on their faces. They then purposefully
grasped the side of the camera, and the
screen goes blank.
“It was like they knew exactly how
to stop a camera from capturing what
they were doing. Maybe they had been
caught on camera in the past?”
Sources from the hospital said
they then saw a group of ten or so
males attempting to “unplug” the
equipment, before descending into an
argument about how to remove the
technology in question.
A patient said she could hear
mutterings, various “grunts” and large
bangs from inside the CT consultation
room.
It seems the team of men later
managed to dismantle parts of the
machine, and were seen apparently
skulking through the corridors
lumbering the large chunks of metal,
dragging wiring along behind them.
Said one patient who was walking the
corridors after being unable to sleep:
“It looked and sounded like a bunch
of cavemen dragging carcasses down
the hall. I couldn’t quite work out who
they were or what they were carrying,
but I kept getting wafts of beer from
them as they stumbled out of sight.”
The students, who appeared to be of
an “athletic physique,” then offered
up the scanner once reassembled for
cash in hand early Thursday morning.
They were willing to take the first
offer presented to them.
The shopkeeper told Hangman
they don’t usually trade in medical
equipment, especially pieces that
looked like they had been forcefully
dismantled then reassembled and was
leaking some questionable liquid, but
the boys seemed desperate.
“All of them were talking at the
same time in the store, but I caught
snippets of something to do with a
broken window, some sort of fine and
having to pay for training next year.
“They also managed to produce
about 30 silver sterling stethoscopes,
50 copies of a yellow and green A5
handbook in various states of distress
and some sort of large bird costume.”
The shopkeeper said she handed
over roughly £2,000 for the lot. “They
seemed pleased: one of them said
something about how that it was more
than “stewarding” would have got
them anyway.”
In unrelated news, Imperial
Medicals have managed to raise
enough funds to pay for their training,
coaching and transport for the next
academic year. The team are reported
to be “ecstatic.”
It is uncertain if the men suffered from any radiation issues after
hoping that finally I can get
some more information on my
limp handshake but I really
don’t want to risk searching
for it using the hall’s Internet
service.”
When asked if he was aware of
the incognito searching mode,
he refused to comment. He
did add however that he might
give Ultimate Frisbee a go now
though, as “maybe a bit more
exercise may put some wind in
the sails.”
Sources close to Hangman
revealed this week that Chris
Kaye, our esteemed Deputy
President (Welfare) took a female
senior member of staff out for a
date – to Reynolds. The staff member
in question was keen to investigate
Reynolds and its perceived drinking
culture, and Kaye seized the
opportunity to accompany her.
“She invited me,” he blushed, before
continuing, “Or rather, I did maybe
invite myself along but she was
pleased I think for the company.”
The couple were spotted catching
the number 10 bus outside of
the Royal Albert Hall towards
Hammersmith, before walking up
to the bar under the Charing Cross
Hospital. The pair braved Wednesday
Sports night, a venue some would
consider challenging at best, and
downright terrifying at worst for a
first date.
Chris said it was one of the more
difficult first dates to navigate,
especially as he had not met her on
Tinder. “I hadn’t had a chance to stalk

has smooth irst date, but
doesn’t seal the deal
her, so didn’t know what to ask about.
She talked a lot about education
policy which was interesting, but my
phone died so I couldn’t google a lot
of what she was saying.”
Chris also found it difficult to
enjoy any privacy during the date.
“Obviously, I am kind of a big deal,
so people were coming up to me and
saying hi. People also recognised
my date from things like the
student prospectus, being on stage
on graduation and having her own
Wikipedia page.”
However, the date seemed to
go smoothly, and although Chris
wouldn’t say if they left together,
he did say they would be seeing
each other again. “We sit on a lot of
the same advisory boards, so I will
actually be seeing her next Tuesday
morning to discuss the outcomes to
the General Meeting for the Higher
Education Funding.”
He told us that although its not his
preferred second date of choice, he
understands she is a busy woman.
“She’s so important, like myself, so we
have to just make time where we can
if we are going to make this work.
“It is still early days but you know,
YOLO.”
Is this Imperial's most eligible and most well endowed bachelor?
