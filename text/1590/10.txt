visits HYPER
JAPAN and
meets some of
the stars behind
the convention
“HYPER
JAPAN
showcased
a strikingly
extra-
ordinary
cultural
event."
“HYPER
JAPAN
boldly
claims
that it is
the best
depiction
of Japanese
culture
outside of
Japan.”
The biannual gathering of
dedicated Japanese markets
and exhibitors took place
two weekends ago, and managed an
exhibition which was a verifiable
smorgasbord of Japanese culture.
Exhibitions like these are a
clarion call for like-minded small
and medium business owners to
come together in one place to show
themselves to curious wanderers. The
self-styled HYPER JAPAN Christmas
Market succeeds brilliantly in
creating a thematic atmosphere,
presenting not just the Japanese
products, but stages and performance
areas which emblazon every single
aspect of Japanese culture, from
idiosyncratic fusion bands to
traditional Japanese tea ceremonies
and dance theatre. HYPER JAPAN
boldly claims that it is the best
depiction of Japanese culture outside
of Japan, and as an outsider to the
event whilst knowing a fair amount
about the country, I am utterly
bought by their claim
The event takes place in Olympia
National, near Hammersmith and
West Kensington. The bottom floor
has an array of delicious smelling
food stalls, all selling Japanese dishes
and slightly bigger businesses along
with a huge stage at one end, whilst
the top floor seemed to be reserved
for independent shop-owners and a
smaller display area where martial
arts and other demonstrations were
carried out.
From any point in the exhibition
hall, whatever was coming from the
speakers beside the stage could be
heard, and the stage could be seen
from any point on the top floor,
which mean that you never missed a
thing – and never had to push your
way through crowds or fight for seats
to see what was going on. Between
performances, J-POP (Japanese
pop music) greatly enhanced the
ambience of the whole event.
Cosplay, or dressing up as fictional
characters found in anime, manga,
video games, films, etc is a noticeable
theme in the convention. Contests
were on for the best costumes but
I only recognised Hatsune Miku,
a “humanoid persona voiced by a
singing synthesizer application” after
watching a quasi-3D performance in a
side room of her songs. Sounds pretty
weird to someone passing by, but I
greatly admire the Japanese creative
spirit and Hatsune Miku has turned
out to be a massive marketing success
for the company behind her.
Although cosplay is one of the loci
of the event as one of the pillars of
modern Japanese culture, it is not by
far the main one. In fact, one of the
major successes of the convention
overall was the fact that there wasn’t
a single, individual focus; rather, a
smooth amalgamation of all aspects
of Japanese culture presented in
tandem which are consciously
recognisable but simply flow together
and feel natural.
On the upper floor, there are a
group of retro arcade machines
and Japanese video game consoles,
including a Dance Dance Revolution
on which I witnessed meteoric
competition which redefined my
definition of “pro gamer”.
In contrast, downstairs belonged to
big Japanese video game developers
such as Square Enix and Capcom
which promoted their latest products
and merchandise.
Soon the crowd was gathered
around a sushi stand, and I
managed to find myself witnessing
a tuna cutting display. The show
culminated with the tuna mercilessly
dichotomised by a five-foot long
sword. I can testify that this smooth-
filleted tuna beats John West with
regards to taste and texture by
formerly unimaginable amounts.
By far the most enjoyable was the
sampling of all the sake, whisky,
and umeshu alcohols for sale. The
exhibitors were generous with
their samples and light-headed
gratification led me to purchase a
bottle of Choya Umeshu, a delicious
citrus-smelling and flavour wine.
Ume is a sweet Asiatic fruit which is
described as somewhere between an
apricot and a plum.
The stage is full with back-to-back
displays of sake mixing, technodelic
performances, karaoke, and an
incredibly diverse, ballpark outline of
every imaginable and unimaginable
aspect of Japanese culture. However,
one performer’s story stood out as
particularly galvanising. I snuck
backstage to get a cheeky interview in
after the performance had ended.
Her name is Diana Garnett, an
American singer who shot to fame
last year by winning Song for Japan,
described as the Japanese equivalent
to The Voice, Britain’s Got Talent,
and the X-Factor all rolled into one.
“I’ve wanted to become a singer in
Japan since I was seven,” Diana tells
me. “My dad watched a lot of anime
so I had exposure to Japanese music
and I wanted to be a performer before
I’d figured out all the details, like how
far Japan is from Washington DC.”
