Biopics have a weird status in the
film industry. Most struggle
to assemble some form of
narrative arc around the messy lives
of the famous, but some – and only
some – transcend that to become
something greater.
Just occasionally, a film like Tim
Burton’s Ed Wood or Spike Lee’s
Malcolm X comes along, proving that
really can be something more to
biographical films than just ‘re-telling
the story’. Faced with the life of James
Brown, one of the most influential,
if not the most influential, figures
in music, Get On Up has high
expectations saddled on it from the
start.
And damn, if it doesn’t deliver on
them straight away. The opening
is riddled with an infectious
momentum, picking out two
moments in Brown’s life before the
inevitable jump back to the early
days. An elderly, borderline delirious
Brown threatens some conference-
types with a shotgun for the crime
of using his toilet, and a younger,
successful Brown berates a pilot
under fire in Vietnam, insisting that
they make it to their gig for the army
despite the explosions rattling the
craft. Two very different moments,
two very different snapshots of
Brown. But immediately, two things
are clear.
First: This is Chadwick Boseman’s
finest hour so far. He is utterly
consumed by the role, as magnetic
a screen presence as you’d expect
– as you’d demand – from James
Brown, and if this doesn’t prove to
be the (potentially Oscar-nominated)
breakout role that launches him
into the acting big leagues, I’ll be
investing in an edible hat. The recent
announcement of his casting as Black
Panther in Captain America: Civil War
and Black Panther’s own solo film
probably means I won’t need to worry
too much about that hat, but just in
case.
Secondly: The Help director Tate
Taylor is having an absolute blast
here. Working off a screenplay from
Jez and John-Henry Butterworth
(the duo behind the summer’s most
underrated piece of genius, Edge of
Tomorrow), his scattershot approach
to chronology can sometimes make
things a little jarring – following
those first two scenes, the film ends
up with whiplash from jumping back
to the beginning, at which point it
starts to meanderingly tell the story
in vaguely chronological order,
replete with the occasional scene from
a completely different point in time.
But there’s a sense of fun pervading
it all that makes you want to let the
film off the hook – and besides,
telling the story straight would be
far too obvious for a film about a
man who defied the obvious. That
subversive nature slips through in
Brown’s winks and nods to camera,
culminating in one point with his
walking out of a scene while talking
to Dan Aykroyd’s manager, instead
opting to continue the argument with
the camera.
The most extreme example of its
kind, that little diversion manages to
overcome its oddities to help cement
the concept of this being Brown’s
story from Brown’s perspective, a
tale – a legend – that he is spinning
the audience, even if that occasionally
means letting him off the hook
somewhat for his less endearing
activities.
The fact this review has mostly
centred around the lead actor and the
director is a reasonable reflection of
the impression the film gives off – the
supporting cast all put in excellent
turns, with no noticeably flawed
performances beyond the occasional
‘man with one line’ being a bit dull,
and the music inescapably glorious,
is, obviously, but it all keeps coming
back to Brown, and Boseman’s electric
performance. Looking anywhere else
or noticing anyone else, is tricky.
Even in those moments where
Brown is being borderline malicious,
sociopathic even, it’s still him you end
up rooting for.
Get On Up is a clever piece of
film-making, an alluring cocktail
of snapshots from a true industry
legend, all bound together by
Boseman. Despite the time-jump-
whiplash, there’s an undeniable sense
of momentum, and an infectious joy
that spreads throughout – making the
moments where the film pulls the rug
from under you all the more painful.
It may not be to everyone’s taste,
and it may be a tad too long, but Get
On Up grabs your attention and keeps
it for its entire 139-minute running
time. Which is, whichever way you
look at it, a pretty damn respectable
achievement.
Second time’s not that much of a charm

SECTION EDITOR
This year has been an interesting
year for comedy. We’ve
had the hilarious-but-not-
strictly-a-comedy Grand Budapest
Hotel and Guardians of the Galaxy
(amongst many, many others), a glut
of resoundingly mediocre entries
(looking at you, Last Vegas), a few
pieces of questionably quality, and
lastly the prime example in how to
properly do an American comedy
sequel in 22 Jump Street.
The Jump Street sequel was an
exercise in knowing what made
the first film so entertaining, and
respecting that while also making
efforts to carve out new ground. It’s
a high benchmark for comparison,
which makes it a shame that, from the
start, Horrible Bosses 2 wields almost
none of that charm.
This was a much more traditional
sequel, one which adhered to the
spirit of the original (albeit with a
new director) without straying too
far from its comfort zone. A few
genuine laughs aside, the majority
of the humour fell into the standard
trap of aiming to be offensively
amusing, and simply turning out to
be smirk-worthy. The saving grace
came from the natural talent of the
cast, who are genuinely funny people.
The film seemed mostly content to let
Bateman, Sudeikis and Day bounce
off one another, leading to several
scenes that simply drag on too long
with unfunny riffs on various themes,
with the occasional flash of genius.
The fact that the out-takes, played
over the credits, provide the highest
laugh rate per minute speaks volumes
about the talent of the cast – it’s just a
pity that they’ve been lumbered with
a film that feels so oddly happy to
wallow in mediocrity.
Horrible Bosses 2 works best when
it allows the focus to stray outside
the leads – as likeable as the actors
themselves are, their characters are
largely unlikeable jerks, so spending
any real length of time with them
quickly becomes a drag regardless of
any jokes they come out with. Chris
Pine and Jennifer Aniston both
steal the show – the former bringing
a manic energy that channels his
Captain Kirk at his worst, the latter
turning up the nymphomania of her
returning, eponymous horrible boss
beyond the levels of the first film.
Both Pine and Aniston inject the film
with life right when it needs it most,
blasting away the cobwebs of the
excessively long scenes of bickering
to produce something genuinely
funny. The same can’t really be said
for the rest of the supporting cast
– there aren’t bad performances by
any means, it’s more a case of poorly
Horrible Bosses 2
Director: Sean Anders
Screenplay: Sean Anders, John
Morris
Cast: Jason Bateman, Jason
Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Chris
Pine, Jennifer Aniston
written characters and a total waste
of the ridiculously talented cast, not
least Christoph Waltz.
Horrible Bosses 2’s cast really is its
biggest strength. The soundtrack
is utterly abominable (perhaps
predictably), pushing the ‘popular
music that’s sort of relevant
right now’ button repeatedly,
while the editing is lazy and the
cinematography standard for
American comedies – a bunch of
talking heads, a few predictable sight
gags, and that’s your lot. There are a
few inspired moments – the montage
of the trio’s plan for the money
drop that forms the film’s centre-
piece is hilarious, and the editing/
cinematography suddenly up their
game to match – but mostly the
whole thing just feels like a missed
opportunity. It’s an entertaining
missed opportunity, and if you have
two hours in your life that you need
to fill with a comedy on the big screen
you could definitely do worse, but
in the end, Horrible Bosses 2 is just
another not-bad, not-great either
sequel. It’s a shame.
