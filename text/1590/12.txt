"Psychedelics
are more
than just a
faded hippie
emblem."
Dr Robin Carhart-Harris
talks about LSD and the
Psychedelic state
Lauren Ratcliffe interviews Imperial researcher
and learns how and why LSD could be used to
treat depression and addictions
"...deep
curiosity in
wanting to
understand
the human
condition."
Complete understanding
behind the powerful effects of
psychedelics on the mind has
remained a mystery for many decades.
Over 60 years has passed since
the first discovery of lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD) and since then
surprisingly little concrete knowledge
of its effects on the brain has been
established.
Legal restrictions and long-
held preconceptions surrounding
psychedelics have hampered the
progression of research into these
elusive compounds. Dr Robin Carhart-
Harris of Imperial College University
is one of a few scientists on the pursuit
to bring a more scientific approach
to modern psychedelic research and
has found evidence to indicate that
psychedelics are more than just a
faded hippie emblem.
I met up with him in his offices in
Hammersmith and discussed, among
other things, the rise and fall of LSD
in the scientific and public domain,
theories behind hallucinations, near-
death experiences and his research in
using LSD to understand the inner
workings of the mind.
LSD DISCOVERY
To fully understand where science
is today we must take a brief look it’s
past. The discovery of LSD’s unique
effects arose accidently by Albert
Hofmann during the 1930s.
Then a 37 year old medicinal
chemist at the pharmaceutical
company Sandoz in Basel, Hofmann
began isolating active components of
medicinal plants, one of which was
ergot - a parasitic fungus that grows
in rye and used back then to reduce
maternal bleeding during childbirth.
During this pursuit in April 1943,
he inadvertently exposed himself to
LSD, an ergotamine derivative, and
came home one day to find himself
tripping balls, or as he puts it: “I
perceived an uninterrupted stream
of fantastic pictures, extraordinary
shapes with intense kaleidoscopic play
of colours.”
CONTROVERSY
Soon after this quirky discovery,
further scientific research established
that LSD could lower ego defences
and potentially allow access to the
unconscious mind, revealing it as a
potential tool to use in conjunction
with psychotherapy treatments.
Between the 1950s and mid-1960s
over 1,000 clinical papers and several
dozen books were published alongside
six international conferences on LSD-
assisted psychotherapy. However,
what Hofmann could never have
foretold was the progression of LSD
from medical remedy to recreational
drug.
When, after more than ten years
of uninterrupted scientific research,
the drug began to take on a more
public profile as sensationalist
newspaper reports on LSD’s curious
effects opened the doors to public
experimentation.
One figure that spearheaded this
transition was Dr Timothy Leary,
a known apostle of LSD, who held
a vision that progressively diverted
from scientific research and moved
towards the dangerous game of social
and psychological revolution.
People began taking LSD for
pleasure and popularity of the drug
grew almost synonymously with the
hippie movement, taken as a way to
get in touch with the self, other people
and the environment, or to quote
Leary: “Turn on, tune in, drop out.”
In 1966, due to bad publicity and
political concerns, the authorities
took direct action against LSD and
made it illegal in the United States.
What shortly followed was the
implementation of the UK Misuse
of Drugs Act in 1973, classing LSD
under Schedule I, which by definition
assumes it has little or no therapeutic
value.
SUGGESTIBILITY
Since then, the story has stayed
much the same and drug policies
more or less haven’t changed
since the 1970s. In the Centre
for Neuropsychopharmacology
at Imperial College, however, Dr
Robin Carhart-Harris is pioneering
investigations into LSD with results
that suggest a change is long overdue
as current drug laws suffocate the
progression of neuroscience research.
By piling up strong evidence-based
scientific knowledge on LSD’s
effects on the brain, Carhart-Harris
is bringing a refreshingly scientific
approach to this weird and wonderful
drug.
With a background in psychology
and psychoanalysis at Bournemouth
University, Carhart-Harris
later moved to the University
of Bristol to continue a PhD in
psychopharmacology and is now a
research associate at Imperial College’s
Hammersmith campus, where I found
him one fresh October morning.
With an infectious enthusiasm for
his work and a clear, careful way of
speaking, Carhart-Harris describes
his progression from psychology to
psychedelic research when, during his
undergraduate years, his studies failed
to satisfy his deep curiosity in wanting
to understand the human condition.
“[Psychoanalysis] doesn’t have much
grounding in a scientific approach… it
was more going around the edges and
not getting to the core of what is really
interesting and juicy,” he explains.
What truly changed the game,
however, was his discovery of the book
‘Realms of the Human Unconsciousness:
Observations from LSD Research’ by
Czech psychiatrist, Stanislav Grof,
who worked on LSD in the 60s and
70s. “I read it in a day, was blown
away and then thought this is really
what I want to do, understand LSD in
the mind and put some real meat on
psychoanalysis,” he says.
Carhart-Harris’ research uses
LSD as a way to manipulate
the mind and understand what
Dr Robin Carhart-Harris is bringing LSD research back to the 21
American counterculture against the Vietnam war
