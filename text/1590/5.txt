er Union sanctions put in place
We as a club fully understand the
severity of the two incidents that
we have been implicated in. We do
not condone activities that cause
offence to members of the public
nor activities that can lead to
potential damage.
We also do not instil a culture
of excessive drinking of alcohol
within our club.
When these two allegations
were placed against the club, my
committee and myself enforced
internal club sanctions. For those
involved in the Heston incident,
all players in the third team were
banned from social activities for
two months. For those involved in
the coach incident, we enforced a
club-wide ban on socialising to end
mid December. We also introduced
a club Alcohol Policy, and a Tour
Etiquette Document.
These addressed the perceived
drinking culture that surrounds
rugby and they also show that
we are addressing the perceived
drinking culture surrounding rugby.
Both these internal sanctions and
these documents have shown the
extent of our co-operation with the
Union, College Tutors and Faculty
and was our attempt to try and deal
with these situations as quickly and
smoothly as possible.
Although we understand
the sanctions we feel that the
Governance Committee overlooked
the inancial implications the
sanctions would have on the club.
Our club is currently not sitting on
steady inancial footing.
This is not helped by the fact
that Imperial College Union, who
claim to treat both clubs for all
college students and medic-centred
clubs on equal footing, give the
medic rugby team 37% less grant
compared to IC Rugby; Both IC and
us have 3 teams, both our First XV
compete in the BUCS 1A league.
We always exceed our
membership targets and we
bring home more silverware for
the university and enter more
competitions as well as earning
Sport Imperial more BUCS
points. Somehow the Union have
“justiied” this large disparity in
their budgeting system and they
then also deemed their inancial
sanctions towards our club
appropriate in light of this.
These sanctions will enforce a
£10,000 loss to the club, which will
render the club inancially defunct
by the end of the 2015/16 season.
I feel that if the Governance
Committee were aware the extent
the inancial implications would
effect the club, it could call into
question whether Imperial College
Union have an alternative motive
as to shut down ICSM clubs, to seek
a merger; a rumour that has hung
over our heads for the past few
years.
Another point that is particularly
annoying is that we feel incorrect
minutes from a previous meeting
were passed on to the Governance
Committee due to a clerical
issue, without our knowledge.
The minutes were in the revision
process, but the inalised version of
the correct minutes never reached
the Governance committee. We feel
this may have impacted the decision
made concerning our sanctions,
and therefore feel they may be
disproportionate to what actually
happened.
I personally also felt
uncomfortable by the way I was
treated by some of the senior
authority igures involved with
the process, who acted in ways
I thought were inappropriate
bordering on aggressive in
meetings I had with them. I
approached Tom Wheeler about
these issues I had, and he was
unable to rectify them, stating he
was: “[the authority igure] was
frustrated that he was struggling to
get to an answer [from Cross].” I felt
this was reprehensible given I had
been so co-operative throughout
the whole process.
I do not feel that the welfare
of myself nor my implicated
committee members has been
addressed by anyone senior at
Imperial, except for Dariush.
I disagree that ICSMRFC“[does]
not instil a culture of excessive
drinking”as this directly contradicts
with the fact that a bottle of Port
was listed on the Tour’s kit list
because it is“more eficient”to
drink port.I do not believe that
the actions taken by ICSMRFC
‘addressed’the culture,but I do fully
support the Club for taking its irst
steps towards doing so.
On the complicated subject of
Union Subsidy of ICSMRFC compared
with ICURFC,the fact of the matter is
that they budgeted for signiicantly
different expected costs in the CSPB
Budgeting process.ICURFC spends
considerably more on Instructors,
Ground Hire and Travel Expenditure
and had 17.4% more members at the
end of last year.
On the point regarding a“£10,000
loss to the club”it must be stated that
the Club caused signiicant damage
to a Coach,which led to signiicant
repair cost.The inal invoice came to
just over £7,200,of which roughly
£1000 was due to non-window
related repairs (including cleaning
vomit from toilets).The remainder of
the“£10,000 loss”is the opportunity
loss of ICSMRFC being banned from
social activity until 1 January 2015.
It was deemed by the Governance
Committee that allowing the Club
to host a Social event (from which it
proits ~£2,000) after the Club failed
to behave properly during previous
Social Activity was not acceptable.
The conversation referred to
as“inappropriate bordering on
aggressive”demonstrated the Chair
of the Governance Committee’s
frustration with Cross and his
teammate’s assessment of the
window immediately after it was
damaged.Some of those present
on the coach at the time decided
that the window was only fractured,
and did not pose a risk to other road
users,and therefore did not tell the
driver,demonstrating very poor
judgement.
The most frustrating point raised by
George Cross in his statement is that
the decision“could call into question
whether Imperial College Union
have an alternative motive as to shut
down ICSM clubs”.This is thoroughly
absurd.The Union only ever works to
ensure that all members who want
to participate in Union activity,can.
Whether the activity is organised
by a Club that falls within the ACC
(ICURFC) or a Constituent Union
such as CGC,ICSM,or RSM is
irrelevant to us.
Throughout this process,we
have offered to sit down with the
club and discuss the inancial
situation that they are in,and
offer support where it is needed
with a view to ensure activities are
not curtailed past their banned
period.This support can take the
form of allowing the club to use an
overdraft,for example.We were
fully aware of the implications of
the sanctions at the point of passing
them.
better co-operation from the Medical
rugby players than ICURFC, whose
captain is now facing a vote of no-
confidence from Imperial College
Union Council, the Medical team
sanctions may have more adverse
effects than those of the sanctions
suffered by ICURFC.
Dariush stated in his support of the
appeal that the rulings against the
Medicals will “financially cripple,
and possibly disband, a club who have
admitted their mistakes, have been
co-operative and have shown their
eagerness to change to ensure similar
events do not occur in the future.”
Felix spoke to Dariush to expand
upon the issue further. He explained
that, with the Medical team unable
to acquire sponsorship as easily as
ICURFC, and still having similar
costs in running as a team, the
financial costs of the incident could
stifle the clubs ability to pay for
training, transport and facility
hire. “For a team to function at
such a high level, the overheads are
expensive. They can probably cover
their expenditure for next term, but
in the next academic year they will
struggle.”
Currently, the Imperial Medicals
have £7,439.01 in their SGI, and
£2,724.96 in grant money. So far, the
money to pay for the coach repairs
and to cover the loss of earnings
by the coach company (it was off
the road for seven days) has been
deducted from their funds, but the
£5,000 offered up as a “gesture”
by the team captain has yet to be
deducted.
Fines for having to skip BUCS
matches come to around £600, which
they are yet to pay, and the loss of an
expected £2000 from the Christmas
Bop means that financially the club
will be nearing the ends of their
funds very soon. Over the past seven
years, ICURFC had an income of
around £45,000 from sponsorship
alone, whilst the Medical team
only acquired around £3,000. Said
Dariush, “People just don’t want to
sponsor students who will end up
working for the NHS. There is no
incentive there for them to do so, so
they struggle to acquire funds.”
Dariush concluded: “ICSMSU will
do anything to ensure the Medicals
can continue functioning, like they
ICSMSU would do for any club facing
unprecedented financial issues.
However in reality for the club to
continue it will be a struggle.”
