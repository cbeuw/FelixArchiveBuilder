Racism is unacceptable.
Regardless of who you are, the
situation you find yourself in,
or any excuses you may offer up, the
moment you bring up someone’s race
is the moment that you have crossed
the line. However, there seems to
be one area where casual racism is
endemic, and is rarely punished. I am
talking about football. If you Google
football and racism, you will come
upon scores of results, and ones about
the lack of it are rare.
While you may believe this is
actually about sport in general you
only have to look as far as NBA to
see how racism is treated in other
sporting activities. In April this
year, TMZ released a recording from
September 2013 between LA Clippers
owner Donald Sterling and a female
friend.
Sterling told V. Stiviano: “It bothers
me a lot that you want to broadcast
that you’re associating with black
people”, and, “You can sleep with
[black people]. You can bring them in,
you can do whatever you want”, but
“the little I ask you is ... not to bring
them to my games”. The person she
had posed with on Instagram? Magic
Johnson, a Basketball Hall of Fame
player. After the comments he made
he was subsequently forced to sell his
franchise, and now has a lifetime ban.
This all happened within the space of
roughly two months.
Now consider the strange situation
of Malky Mackay. Almost three
months ago text messages of
homophobic, racist and sexist nature
were revealed, which had been
written by Mackay during his tenure
as manager of Cardiff City. This was
further exacerbated when the League
Manager’s association declared that
this was all just “friendly text message
banter” – a statement they soon
apologised for. What!
However, it seems that this did
not seem to be the end of Mackay’s
career, as it justifiably should have
been. Instead he has now found new
employment as manager of Wigan
Athletic. You may think that would
be the end of this story. But wait,
there is more.
In response to the controversy
that surrounded the appointment of
Mackay, Dave Whelan, the Chairman
and Owner, made equally horrible
statements in support of his manager.
He tried to veil his comments as
compliments as well as comment that
certain words weren’t actually racist,
but this resulted in it just coming

off as worse. Yet, no forced sales, nor
lifetime bans, for either of these two
men. In fact, the FA and by extension
FIFA itself is doing next to nothing
to stomp out this disease.
They may have their high profile
campaigns, but honestly is this really
cutting down on racism? There have
been so many high profile cases,
which never really lead to any sort
of meaningful punishments. John
Terry? Was found guilty, fined about
two weeks wages and missed four
games before resuming like nothing
had ever happened. Luis Suarez?
Once again found guilty, (strangely
enough supported by his team and
manager) and now living the high
life in Barcelona. There are many
more examples, but all of them seem
to reach the same ending; nobody is
really punished.
If nobody is ever really severely
punished, this casual attitude to
racism will continue. Imagine
saying comparable things to your
fellow students or work colleagues.
You would rightly get the sack
immediately. Anybody who thinks
something as horrid as one race being
better than another is an individual
who should not be part of our society.
But football is one of the only fields
where leniency is upheld. Why? Is it
that FIFA in their inexorable quest
for profits has forgotten how to keep
the beautiful game unblemished?
One of the possible reasons is because
in banning people, they risk losing
profits. If they had banned Luis
Suarez or John Terry more severely,
they may have faced lawsuits, and
lost ticket revenues. Do they think
therefore that it is much better to
give a slap on the wrist, and hope it all
blows over?
I am not trying to say that racism
has been eradicated in all other
sports, but in football it seems so
much more prevalent. What really
frightens me is that whilst this game
is able to transcend race, culture,
language and sex, it will never be
able to cross boundaries, because
certain individuals permeate football
and certain authorities refuse to do
anything about it.

8th March 2009,Kingsmead,
Durban.An Australian batsman
is entertaining the crowd with a
superb hundred.It was his second
of the game,and meant that he,at
the age of 20,became the youngest
man to score two hundreds in a Test
Match.It was just his second test
match.This week,we mourn his
passing.
Phillip Hughes,who would have
turned 26 on Sunday,was largely
considered one of Australia’s most
talented batsmen when he started
out for New South Wales at the
age of 18.He became the youngest
batsman to score a century in the
Shefield Shield Final when he
scored 116 against Victoria to lead
his side to victory.It was his maiden
First Class century.
On Tuesday,when playing for
his adopted side South Australia
against his former side New South
Wales,Hughes was struck by a
bouncer from former colleague Sean
Abbott.Hughes fell forward onto his
face.He would remain unconscious
until his death in the afternoon on
Thursday in Sydney.
Hughes struggled to make the
Australian team,after being“found
out”against the short ball by
Andrew Flintoff in the 2009 Ashes,
and had to settle for being the irst
alternative for the national side.
That didn’t stop him from scoring 86
from 75 balls in a win against New
Zealand and his third test century
against Sri Lanka in 2011.He was
selected for the one-day squad in
2013,where he became the irst
(and only) Australian to score on a
hundred on debut.He would add
one more in the same series.
In his inal game Hughes was on 63
not out before that fatal ball.His
team mate Kane Richardson paid
tribute,saying“Even in your last
innings they still couldn’t touch you.
63*”
Hughes died from vertebral artery
dissection,an injury that has only
ever been recorded a hundred times.
And only once due to a cricket ball.
The injury was described by doctors
as“extremely rare and a freak
injury”.
He leaves behind his mother,father,
brother and sister.
And a grieving cricket world.
