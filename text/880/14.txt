Dear Sir,
Your article last week about Cecil
Parkinson left a lot to be desired. Firstly
'Cecil Drinks Perrier! Full shocking story
page 3!' In the true spirit of Conservatism
there was minimal Governmental
intervention in the purchase of
refreshments. In fact there was none: I
bought the Perrier at QT. I w o u l d rather
have bought British, but there wasn't any,
and I hadn't time to pop d o w n to High
Street K e n . I hoped he enjoyed it, I can't
stand the stuff. I promise we'll do better
next time.
A quick survey at Friday's ConSoc
meeting revealed that everyone
W h a t ' s O n
present—all true Conservatives—could
name the country's third largest party.
This is a higher percentage than among
Liberal Democrat supporters.
More serious was your correspondent's
misquoting of remarks M r Parkinson
made on the state of the economy. M r
Parkinson said that the Conservative
Party would never adopt 'win the
election, pay later' policies. It didn't in
1981 and will not now. A t both times the
Government correctly insisted on tight
monetary policies as the only w a y to
control inflation, even if this jeopardised
re-election prospects. T h e twisted
reporting in this part of the article gave a
AN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS IN AND AROUND IMPERIAL
COLLEGE
completely false representation of the
Government's economic policies.
1 think some mention might have been
made somewhere of ConSoc. W e put a lot
of time and effort into making our
speaker meetings enjoyable a n d
successful. Particular thanks must go to
Alan Bailey, Julian Dyson, Thomas Wyatt
and Michael Hoskin. W e expect our next
guest speaker, Edwina Currie (Tuesday,
same time, same place), to be as popular.
Admission is free to anyone w h o can
name the country's largest political party.
The unattended bag was challenged,
twice. Later it was taken away for
interrogation. Sadly, it was claimed before
we'd got it to confess anything.
Hope to see y o u all there o n Tuesday.
Yours faithfully,
Ultan McCarthy, Physics 3.
