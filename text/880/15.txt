Bailey's on the Rocks \Veaf Sir
LETTERS
Dear Sir,
Alan Bailey's neanderthal treatment of
an issue as complex as sex changes
(FELIX 879) is symptomatic of the extent
to which tunnel-vision and intellectual
impotence c a n castrate the ability to
rationally consider and respond to the
impact of unavoidable challenges to our
social fabric. T h e ever accelerating effect
of science and technology on our lives
has to be regarded with a mind set
devoid of any preconceived and simplistic
ideas.
For example, to what extent does
genetic engineering enter the domain of
medical healthcare as a 'pre-emptive'
cure? T h e A l a n Bailey's of the world will
concentrate o n propagandist side issues
like the 'deviant' parents w h i c h choose
the sex of their children; ignoring, for
example, that genetic engineering gives
us the chance to eliminate some
hereditary diseases which condemn
thousands of people to a lifetime of sub-
normal existence.
O n the sex-change issue, what is the
value to society of 25,000 physiologically
maladjusted a n d potentially unstable
people? T o put d o w n the solution to a
psychological problem w h i c h these
'revolting creatures' should face up to is a
crude, totalitarian disregard for the prime
ethic of any progressive society; to
maximise the freedom of its individuals.
One of the main problems of people like
A l a n Bailey, stomping around in their
self- righteous intellectual jackboots, is
that they actually believe that there are
absolute moral standards which can be
applied to people: there is a 'good' and a
'bad' person, a 'deviant' a n d a 'weirdo'.
W a k e up! G o o d and bad can at most
only be applied to the interaction
between two or more people. A person
who has a sex change is not a 'bad'
person for the simple reason of having
undergone an operation: it's the effects of
the operation o n his interaction with
others that has to be judged. Has A l a n
Bailey ever met somebody w h o has had a
sex change?
There is a simple reason for people like
Alan Bailey to try and arrange everything
into little piles of 'good' a n d 'bad': they
are simply not strong enough to face up
to the fact that life is disorder, that w e
are not in control to the extent to which
we think w e are. It's so easy to fall into
the trap of accepting what religions,
ideologies or even just plain intellectual
sloth tells y o u is 'the answer': it makes
you feel in control. Y o u could almost
forgive them: spoon-fed a diet of order,
shelter and unlimited possibilities, behind
a judeo-christian religion which arrogantly
supposes to have an answer for
everything and a self-sustaining economic
environment based on the m a x i m gun
(...), the chaos a n d turbulence that 90% of
the world's population have to cope
with—reality, dammit!—on a daily basis
are easily hidden.
But y o u can't: w e can't afford to
condone narrow-mindedness. W e need
responsible, creative people w h o will
work out n e w paradigms for the w a y our
society should evolve, not primitive,
stagnant, jingoistic closet fascists.
