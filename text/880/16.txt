HE'S 54, HE MANAGES
4000 PEOPLE, AND HE'S BEEN IN
HIS INDUSTRY FOR 25 YEARS
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HIM
TO SPEND £5 MILLION?
You're in a meeting with your
manager and the Managing
Director of your client. They're a
£300m company planning
expansion into Europe. The M D
turns to your manager:
"If France is that attractive, why
have all our competitors done so
badly there?"
Your manager turns to you.
You're the one who's spent the
last three weeks analysing the
French market (you were in Paris
interviewing last week).
Your answer is concise, if a little
nervous, and two heads nod in
agreement. One month later,
convinced by the quality of the
analysis, the client board votes
to build the plant you
recommended.
It's a typical result. As the
largest strategic management
consultancy in the U K , Bain &
Company's task is to help clients
produce superior performance in
every aspect of their business.
As an Associate Consultant at Bain
you are an essential part of that
process. The situation we've
described is one you'll learn to take
in your stride. The job demands
maturity, problem solving ability,
commitment and resourcefulness,
and makes use of any language
skills. To those qualities we'll add
a rigorous training that will equip
you to deal with complex business
problems. You'll work with
like-minded people who'll rely on
your contribution almost from the
word go.
If that's the kind of challenge that
appeals to you, come to our
presentation and cocktail reception.
