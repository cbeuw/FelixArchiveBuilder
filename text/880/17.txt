Manager's Bit
Medics Gig
The appalling cock-up in communications
over the Doctor and the Medics gig has
cost the Union £5.5k. College Estates had
given the go ahead for the band to play
in the Marquee that was used for the
Careers Fair. It was intended that the
profits would subsidise the potential loss
of the staging of the n e w improved
Careers Fair set-up. Unfortunately no
agreement with College was made in
writing. Refectories had not been
consulted and they had a booking in the
M D H o n the same night. Quite reasonably
they objected to the noise that would
have ensued a n d the lack of separate bar
facilities to cater for the gig goers.
It's all very well allowing business to be
conducted in an informal w a y if the deal
is small and concerns organisation with
one third party. But, w h e n it comes to
the staging of a function for a thousand
punters, a large sum of money, and
dealing with many College departments,
it must be done b y the book. It is a
lesson that I hope the Union will have
learnt from, as ICU cannot afford more
losses of the same magnitude. Trusting
FELIX is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College
SW7 2BB (Tel: 071-225 8672). Manager: Chris Stapleton,
the w o r d of one m a n is not good enough,
so get them to sign o n the dotted line.
We saw enough inept actions made by
last year's D P a n d it w o u l d be a shame to
get back into that rut.
Security
Security has been tightening up its act
helped b y observant staff. I a m told that
loss of College property (computers etc)
has dropped, but that personal property
thefts are still high. This, I a m afraid, is
down to you.
A m a n was stopped and questioned the
other day, as he was acting suspiciously.
Security was called in and after half an
hour managed to verify his identity by
calling St Mary's. During this time,
however, another character in the same
building made his w a y to another part of
the building and acquired a wallet. In this
instance it was just a case of bad timimg,
but it does show they are getting their
act together.
Even people w h o have had their
lockers broken into, should be aware of
leaving valuables around i n easily
perpetrated areas. T h e stupid thing about
the theft in M e c h E n g is that an, as yet
Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Imperial
Business Manager: Jeremy Burnell, Advertising Manager:
unknown, Chinese student called at the
stores in the basement and requested a
pair of cutters. T h e cutters were handed
over without a signature being obtained
and surprise, surprise, security are very
interested in talking to h i m . Such action
is contemptable and I believe that strong
words have been had within the
department. T h e message from Security
is, as ever, do not leave valuables in
jackets in unlocked areas...you have been
warned.
