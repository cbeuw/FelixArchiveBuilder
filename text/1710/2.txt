The Department of
Chemistry will pilot
a new module, The
Chemical Kitchen, for
first years

W
hether or
not you are
a chem-
ist, you
definitely have some
experience with react-
ing chemicals – in the
kitchen. On a molecular
level, cooking is simply
chemistry. The Imperial
College London De-
partment of Chemistry
agrees, and will be
advancing this notion
by introducing a new
module: “Introduction
of Culinary Practices”
for first year under-
graduates who enter in
autumn 2019.
The Chemical Kitchen,
F
irst year medical
student, Hamzah
Selim, has de-
livered his first
baby - at a tube station.
Hamzah, who grad-
uated from Imperial
Heroic Hamzah helps deliver baby at tube station
in 2018 with a BSc in
Biomedical Science and
now studies at University
College London, was on
his way home following
an anatomy lecture on the
afternoon of Tuesday 15th
January when he heard
two women shouting for
help.
He saw the mother
leaning against a wall
on the Northern line
platform. “I went over
to help because it looked
like she was about to
faint”, told Hamzah of
the experience. When he
reached her, he realised
the mother was in labour
and the “baby was 50%
out already”. Hamzah
then sat the woman down
and delivered the baby
boy.
Hamzah said his train-
ing from the time he spent
working on a maternity
ward kicked in: “it was
just instinct”.
The mother had been
she was going into labour
shortly before 2pm. She
also told Hamzah she had
given birth to three other
children.
Paramedics arrived
minutes after the boy was
born and cut the umbil-
ical cord. The child and
mother were then later
taken to hospital by the
medics.
as the module is also
called, aims to introduce
students to laboratory
skills and practical experi-
ence via a more approach-
able and unconventional
method. Lesson plans will
cover traditional cooking
techniques as well as
methods such as “spher-
ification” (think tapioca
pearls in bubble tea).
This trial module is
part of a “Techniques
Bootcamp” that first year
chemists will attend in
groups of eight, brought
about by the ongoing
curriculum review of all
Imperial College under-
graduate teaching.
The sessions will train
students how to document
practical work, observa-
tion skills and dexterity,
achieving consistent
results, and executing
written directions. The
Department hopes that
students will become
accustomed to complex,
practical tasks, and will
develop ordered and
systematic approaches to
them.
The Department of
Chemistry is developing
this unconventional
module in collaboration
with Jozef Youssef from
the Basque Culinary
Centre. Youssef is the
founder of Kitchen
Theory, a gastronomy
experience design lab, and
has had years of experi-
ence at Michelin star res-
taurants such as The Fat
Duck. His work intensely
analyses how our senses
influence our dining ex-
perience. For example, he
investigates how colours
and symmetry can affect
the perception and enjoy-
ment of food.
Another member of
the development team is
Roger Kneebone, Profes-
sor of Surgical Education
and Engagement Science.
He believes the benefits
will extend beyond culi-
nary and chemistry. “The
Chemical Kitchen will
encourage social cohesion
amongst
students, developing
a sense of collegiality
rather than competition
within a safe environment
that encourages personal
growth and supportive
behaviour," he said.
The techniques covered
by The Chemical Kitchen
were tested out by an
alumna from the De-
partment of Chemistry,
Katerina Stavri. She said:
“This great initiative will
provide a fun, non-threat-
ening chemistry 'laborato-
ry' for first year students
allowing them to gain
practical experience in
a non-competitive envi-
ronment. There are a lot
of similarities between
a chemistry laboratory
and an experimental
kitchen; from thoroughly
recording observations to
maintaining a clean and
tidy work-space, students
will have the opportunity
to gain, practice and
enhance skills needed in
the lab in an interdiscipli-
nary setting.
“A Chemical Kitchen
requires creativity and
intuition in the same way
as research labs; this lab
serves as a great stepping
stone for young chemists
who will join research
groups in later years of
their studies," she added.
Alan Spivey, Assistant
Provost (Learning &
Teaching), said: “Whether
you want to be a chemist
or a chef, skills such as
meticulous planning and
detailed observation and
recording are vital. The
plan is to encourage safe
experimental practice,
practical reproducibility
and appreciation of the
often-overlooked paral-
lels between the practice
of chemistry and myriad
other activities which
require manual dexterity
so as to inspire our stu-
dents to excel as experi-
mental scientists.”
The connection
between cooking and lab-
oratory chemistry is not
as far-fetched as it seems.
Cooking an egg can
exemplify how proteins
are denatured by heat.
A simple baking lesson
would expose students to
concepts of fermentation,
temperature, and humid-
ity.
Culinary science and
chemistry also overlap in
terms of apparatus. Chefs
are increasingly using sci-
entific equipment in their
kitchens: centrifuges can
be used to extract the oil
from a puree; rotary evap-
orators can concentrate
mixtures to strengthen
flavor; sonic homoge-
nizers can be useful in
tenderizing meat.

THE BAG!
T
he worst part
about having
a New Year's
Resolution is the
inevitable disappointment
when you eventually flop.
I managed to last a grand
total of 17 days before
flopping every single
one of my resolutions.
It was all going so well.
Unfortunately, It is now
17th
January and I've only
been to the gym once in
2019, I haven't touched
a book since 2nd
January
and it is currently after
11pm and I am writing my
editorial. I'm especially
disappointed in myself
because today was going
so well but, as per usual,
the procrstination crept in.
New year, same me...
This week's issue of
Felix sadly comes with
a somewhat harrowing
front page News story. It's
unfortunate that stories
of this ilk are not at all
uncommon at this univer-
sity. This role has afforded
me the opportunity to
speak to a range of people
with different opinions
about the university.
However, it is worrying
how prevalent the senti-
ments expressed in Amy
Freelander's article are
amongst Imperial's staff
and student population.
I remain optimistic that
things are changing, albeit
at snail's pace. My hope
is, through sharing stories
such as these and articles
such as the "supervision
stories" included in the
monthly Postgraduate
section (run in conjunc-
tion with the Graduate
Students' Union), through
Felix, we will be able
to hold the College and
Union to account. This
can affect real, substantial
change at Imperial and
hopefully result in stories
complaining about mis-
treatment at the hands of
the university becoming a
thing of the past.
On a lighter note,
T-May lost her Brexit
vote. I haven't seen a

defeat that embarrassing
sinceArsenal got smacked
6-0 by Chelsea at the
Bridge. Brazil's humbling
at the hands of Germany
at the 2014 World Cup
is a close second. I rate
Theresa May for her
resilience; I've never seen
someone get up from the
canvas with the count at
"nine" so many times.On
Tuesday night, my brother
messaged me asking,
"wagwan with this country
bro? Are we Brexiting or
nah?" To which I could
only respond, "they seem
to be playing some twisted
game of 'Deal or No Deal'
bro, who knows..."
Speaking of my
brother, you might be
wondering why the title
of this editorial is "THE
BAG!". One resolution
that my brother started in
2019 was to relentlessly
pursue the bag this year.
Everyday he snaps me or
messages me to remind
me to remain focused on
our goal. He also reminds
me that I must be a "flipper
and tumbler of the bag,
never the fumbler". These
new age proverbs are ones
to live by so shoutout my
bro! He's a clown but he's
my clown init.
Also, quick shoutout
to Hamzah Selim! You
can read about his heroics
on page three but my
old football teammate
managed to keep the un-
diagnosed Marfan's at bay
for long enough to deliver
a baby on a tube station.
What a hero!
I'm really struggling
to ramble today. Why are
you still reading? Don't
you have coursework or
something better to be
doing? Anyway, Section
of the Week for this
week goes to Games. The
Games section returns
with a bang; a four page
extravaganza which even
proved enough to thwart
the mighty Arts section!
Congrats lads!
