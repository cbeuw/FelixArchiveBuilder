roamed across
I m p e r i a l
campuses this
Monday, as a new initi-
ative banning men from
College premises was
implemented.
Deputy President
(Philandering & Servic-
ing), Gloria Sasparrello,
recently announced the
introduction of ‘Meat-
free Mondays’, a scheme
wherein all men would
be banned from campus
every Monday during term
time. The initiative, which
came into effect this week,
was said to be inspired by
reducing the College’s
carbon footprint. This
runs in line with College
Overlord Janice Fast’s
environmental policy of
‘Keeping Imperial in the
Green.’
“Forget cows polluting
the planet,” said Sasparel-
lo, “have you smelt the
men’s room on Level 4 of
the Library? There’s prob-
ably a hole in the ozone
layer above Sherfield
from the stench alone, let
alone all the backlog of
shit. Originally the plan
was to redirect the pipes
to the Union to harvest
the gas and sell it to UCL,
but we had to be realistic,
so this was the next best
thing. If you can’t use
‘em, ban ‘em, eh?”
The initiative saw at-
tendance rates drop across
most departments, with
EEE recording a 100%
decrease in attendance,
including lecturers and
went ahead and did it! I
blame the damn vegan
feminists!”
Union staff are report-
edly unhappy about the
initiative, as it means that
three out of the five Sabb
officers effectively get
long weekends. When
asked about his stance on
the issue, Union President
Bob Jeffries shrugged and
replied, “who gives a shit?
It means I can spend more
time catching up on my
colouring!”
In response to allega-
tions of failing to gauge
student support of the
Basically a ghost town // Imperial College
scheme, Sasparello stated
that she had involved
“me, myself and I” in the
consultation. When re-
minded by NegaFelix that
she no longer attended the
university she promptly
rejected reporters’ claims
on eActivities.
In the wake of the
uproar surrounding the
initiative, Council Chair
Andrea ‘Pippy’ Gumpton
was noted to have passed
an emergency resolution
to confiscate the earnings
of her now workless
worthless male counter-
parts.
GTAs. Notable excep-
tions to the rule were the
Business School, as most
of their students were
enrolled online anyway.
Not all members of the
Imperial community are
pleased with the initiative.
“What the hell is this
all about,” wailed Hugh
Revelio, a third year
Mechanical Engineering
student. “I mean, I wasn’t
planning on coming in
anyway, but who the hell
does she think she is,
telling me what to do. She
didn’t even do a proper
student consultation; just

T
he head of
Graduate Stu-
dents’ Union
has narrowly
survived a Vote of No
Confidence (VoNC)
over growing calls for
the constituent union
to part ways with ICU,
NegaFelix has learnt.
Tuna Overthiereman,
GSU President, managed
to cling on to power by
a 1 vote margin, despite
growing calls for her head
on a platter if she didn’t
bring the Graduate Inde-
pendence Act to Council
next week.
The push for GSU
independence, or
#hbarTheDoors as it has
become known, stems
from years of discontent
within the GSU, due to
perceived preferential
treatment of undergradu-
ates compared to the rest
of the student body – in
particular, undergraduate
students getting served
when entering h-bar, the
postgraduate bar.
“All these shitty
undergrads coming into
h-bar, stealing our pints
– enough is enough,” said
Neo Cortez, a second year
PhD in the Department of
Chemistry “We make up
the majority of the stu-
dents here, yet they treat
us like shit. If they want
service, they should go
back to Beit Quad!”
“They literally have
everywhere else,” said
Carmen De La Nerd, an
MRes Bioengineering
student. “No one wants
to see you barely legal
dickheads lounging
around, complaining
about your workload. We
need our space to vent!
This is literally the only
place we have when our
experiments are running.”
This is yet another
in the long list of
discontented movements
within various constituent
unions over the past few
years calling for separa-
tion from the Union. Last
year, ICSMSU faced a
similar push to separate
themselves from the
Union (#MedicOut) and
have Reynolds to them-
selves. The campaign
was short-lived, however,
as campaigners were
promptly assigned to St.
Peter’s Hospital in Surrey,
depriving them of enough
time to continue their
complaining.
An informant from
within the Faculty Build-
ing informed NegaFelix
that the agitation for
separation was likely in
some part instigated by the
current College Overlord,
Janice Fast. “She’s going
for a divide-and-conquer
strategy,” they said. “If
she can break the Union
down, she can sell the land
– it’s in a prime location!”

Calls for postgrad exit from Union nearly VoNC GSU
President
This week your prototype
starts working. You are so
excited that you have to
grab a change of trousers.
Frontal stains continue to
be a problem.
This week your proposal
to leave the Union is
voted down by 230 votes.
Who knew you were this
unpopular.?
This week you miss a
coursework deadline.
You blame your lecturers
and shut down your
department. How dare
they set reasonable
expectations!
This week, you defy
meat-free Mondays and
bring some in for home.
You are mawled to death
whilst feeding the other
carnivores.
This week you decide
that consumerism is a
cancer to society.
But you get a discount on
ASOS’ sale tho...
This week, you ride a
Boris bike to uni, forget
they’re Sadiq cycles and
crash Spain’s economy in
the name of Santander.
To beguile your peers
you post nudes in Subtle
Imperial Dating. They
are reposted to Imperial
College Exposed.
Angry reacts for not
being meat-free ensue.
This week you finally
get that Counselling
appointment you booked
last year! Great!
When asked what your
problem is you realise
you don’t remember
anymore. Shit.
This week you’re a
Liberation Officer.
You applaud Gillette
for tackling toxic
masculinity, but can we
get some some gender
diversity up in here?
You have been
constipated for weeks.
Unfortunately, the only
thing you pass this week
is a vote of no confidence.
This week you’re the
Felix Editor. This was
fun at the start, yeah, but
if you wanted to hear
people complain about
this uni you’d be Alice
Gast’s PA.
