T
hree years ago
last week, David
Robert Jones
passed away at
the age of 69. I remember
it perfectly, as it was the
day I had my first exam
as an Imperial undergrad-
uate. The night before
I had been listening to
Blackstar, the surprise
avant-garde album that
he had released only two
days earlier, and I was still
mesmerised by its dark
tones and the raspiness
of his aged voice. Tired,
stressed, and a little bit
depressed by the sheer
bleakness of the record,
I went to bed, hoping for
a good sleep to ensure a
clear head the following
day. I awoke to a news
alert on my phone, fol-
lowed by a sudden kick
in the stomach as my half-
asleep brain processed the
information displayed on
the screen. My idol was
dead.
But he was not the only
person that passed away
that day. Throughout
his life, he had as many
avatars as a Greek god,
and indeed sometimes it
seemed that he had been
sent from an otherworldly
realm by a mysterious
higher power to marvel us.
He was a young beatnik
from South London that
looked for abandoned
Afghan fur coats in the
dumpsters of Carnaby
Street. An androgynous
alien that performed fake
fellatios on his onstage
bandmates. A European
aristocrat with fascist
inclinations triggered by
a diet of milk, peppers,
and massive amounts of
cocaine. He was all those
characters, and many
more, as every single fan
had a different element
of his persona attached to
them.
To pay him homage in
the best way I can think
of, I have selected a list
of his most underrated
compositions, in chron-
ological order. Listen to
them, and you will be able
understand why the innu-
merable masks he put on
were just that, masks. And
behind them remained
a hidden, even more so-
phisticated personality, an
expert on dozens of fields,
ranging from Kabbalistic
occultism to American
politics. A deep knowl-
edge that allowed him
to become the man who
shocked the world.
‘Cygnet Committee’
(1969)
Hidden in Space
Oddity, the record that
brought him to fame with
its unforgettable title
track,‘CygnetCommittee’
narrates with melancholic
tone the disappointment
that follows the success
of most revolutions, in
no doubt inspired by his
recent experiences with
the hippy-run Becken-
ham Arts Lab. At over
nine minutes, it remains
Bowie’s third longest song
in his entire discography.
‘Quicksand’(1971)
The guitars provide
lightness to this ballad
that shows off Bowie´s
profound understanding
of the esoteric. With
references to occultist
Aleister Crowley and
Nietzschean philosophy,
the song explores themes
that would be further
developed in his future
album Station to Station.
It is not surprising that
this is Marilyn Manson’s
favourite song of all time.
‘Five Years’(1972)
What to say of this
great opener? A perfect
introduction to the glam
rock era symbolised by
his alter ego, the flamboy-
ant Ziggy Stardust, ‘Five
Years’ tells the story of
a man that finds out that
the world will end in the
eponymous time, leading
him to ponder about his
life. Overshadowed by
some of the best and most
famous songs of his career
(‘Starman’, ‘Suffragette
City’, ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll
Suicide,’ and ‘Moonage
Daydream’, to name a
few), its final guitar solo
by Mick Ronson fore-
shadowed the wonders
that of the album that
would soon follow.
‘Lady Grinning Soul’
(1973)
One of Bowie’s many
talents was his ability to
find collaborators who
could enhance and elevate
his songs to a superior
level. That is the case
of virtuoso pianist Mike
Garson, who started a
decades long association
with Bowie in this album.
The masterful piano
entrance combines per-
fectly with Bowie’s silky
voice in this love ballad.
It has been called “the
Bond theme that Bowie
never did”, as its lyrics
and melody fit nicely with
the atmosphere of Roger
Moore’s 007 era.
‘Word on a Wing’
(1976)
Station to Station is a
monument to insanity.
The culmination of his
Thin White Duke period,
he admitted decades after
its release that he had no
recollection whatsoever of
the recording and produc-
tion process, his cocaine
addiction becoming so
consuming that he regu-
larly stored his urine in the
fridge, for fear of witches
stealing it. The occultist
tones of the title track
are further explored in
‘Word on a Wing’, a song
marked with references
to religion and crises of
faith that arose every time
Bowie awakened from his
drug induced delirium.
The angelical chorus that
closes the composition
provides a strong contrast
to the actual state of mind
of the performer.
‘Subterraneans’
(1977)
Move one year into
the future, and you would
find an entirely different
Bowie. Transplanted from
LA to Berlin to end his
addiction once for all,
the mostly instrumental
songs of Low capture the
admission of defeat of
a man that had hit rock
bottom, and musically
serve as precursors to the
synth and funk of the 80s.
The closing track of the
record, ‘Subterraneans’
gloomy melodies in stark
contrast to its delicate
sax solos that evoke past,
happier times. It is sup-
posedly dedicated to the
people living East of the
Berlin Wall, whose suf-
fering was only increased
by the festive memories
of belle-epoque Weimar
Germany.
‘The Secret Life of
Arabia’(1977)
Another great ending
track, this song combines
Bowie’s famous falsetto
with the African rhythms
that would be further
explored in his next
album, Lodger. It has
been unfairly panned as
out of tone with the rest of
the album, but it provides
a great transition to the
styles that Bowie would
fully fledge on later years.
‘Waterloo Sunset’
(2003)
A cover may be a
strange choice for this list,
but Bowie’s version of
the classic Kinks anthem
manages to surpass the
original. Its rockier tone
showed that the swinging
London of the 60s had
become a truly global city
by the late 90s, serving as
an update the most iconic
song ever written about
Londinium.
‘Valentine’s Day’
(2013)
After the superstardom
of the 80s and relative
obscurity of the 90s and
00s, Bowie returned to the
spotlight with a surprise
album that meditated on
both his life achievements
and memories, and his
latest obsessions. Val-
entine’s Day is the latter,
narrating the story of a
teenaged mass shooter in
suburban America.
‘I Can’t Give
Everything Away’
(2016)
How to define Black-
star? A magnus opus that
became even more defin-
itive when Bowie passed
away two days after its
release. This song is the
last album track of his
century spanning career.
Its message of calm
despair before the una-
voidable end will always
resonate with anyone with
half a heart. Truly the
most emotional swansong
ever recorded.
