Jonny Woo’s All-Star Brexit Cabaret
F
or one glorious
night, the creative
mind of Jonny
was unleashed
yet again in theatrical
form, but this time at
the prestigious London
Coliseum. With phe-
nomenal costumes that
glistened so much that
they would make disco
balls blush, a spectacular-
ly funny recollection of
the history of Brexit and
and an astounding group
of vocalists, Jonny Woo’s
All Star Brexit Cabaret
left nothing to be desired.
Before the show even
started I had a good feeling
about it, as I walked into
the theatre to see stalls to
the left and right of the
stage filled with Theresa
May look-alikes. Even-
tually the curtains rose to
reveal Richard Thomas
on the piano, while Sooz
Kempner, Adam Perchard
and Kevin Davie sang a
comical, overly dramatic
introduction to the show.
Suddenly Jonny Woo
took to the stage and
instantly I was bedazzled
by his glittering EU flag
themed jumpsuit; in what
appeared to be an even
more fabulous version of
Strictly Come Dancing.
Giving the audience a
few moments to process
the majesty of his outfit, an
introduction was provided
about the show that was
promptly followed by a
musical number about the
day of the referendum,
depicting both sides of the
debate and how the public
reacted to the results. Now
something I absolutely
loved about the production
is how it remained neutral
by taking an equal number
of jabs at both sides,
with remainers being
portrayed as exaggerated
weed- smoking hipsters
and leavers portrayed as
right-wing racists; with
this, an absurd balance
was achieved.
When it comes to
the showcasing of
politicians the show
pulls no punches, with
David Cameron (Jonny
Woo), Angela Merkel
(Diane Chorley), Boris
Johnson (Jayde Adams),
Nigel Farage (Le Gateau
Chocolat) and Theresa
May all being put on the
comedic chopping block.
A particular favourite of
mine was Jonny Woo’s
take on David Xameron,
as he sung about Camer-
on’s woes along with a
trio of backup singers in a
political rendition of “The
Three Little Pigs”, as well
as Le Gateau Chocolat’s
performance as Nigel
Farage in a magnificent
opera style performance.
With all the turmoil
that is Brexit deal ne-
gotiations, Jonny Woo’s
All-Star Brexit Cabaret
presents the painful
chronology of events in
a fantastically comedic
style, along with gorgeous
costume design and
changes (such a key part
of the performance that
they even had a song for
it), something I enjoyed
most about the show.
Between singing sequenc-
es there were also periods
of stand-up comedy that
featured Jayde Adams’
Boris Johnson impres-
sion and Myra Dubois’s
Britannia performance,
both of which could easily
be described as comedy
gold. Not to forget added
surprises such as the
Theresa May choir (the
lookalikes I mentioned
earlier) bursting onto the
stage with flailing arms,
with some even daring to
imitate the technical chal-
lenge that is May’s robot
dance.
All in all, the only fault
that I could possibly find
with Jonny Woo’s All Star
Brexit Cabaret is that I
wished it were longer,
because God knows I
think everyone wanted
to laugh more about this
horrible mess that we’ve
found ourselves in.
