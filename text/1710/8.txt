its risk of smoking-related
conditions in adulthood
and a premature death,
new research has found.
The study serves as
a caution for mother
smokers, more than half
of whom continue during
pregnancy, say scientists.

adult smokers.
show for the first time
how it impacts on the
development of disease
through life and how
smoking during pregnan-
cy damages the baby’s
DNAin the womb without
changing the genetic
‘code’ itself.
Instead, smoking can
add or remove chemical
groups attached to the
outside of the DNA –
called ‘epigenetic’ tags,
like chemical sticky notes,
through a process called
DNA methylation. These
changes can alter how
certain regions of DNA
are read and copied, so
affect the activity of key
genes.
“Our study shows
compelling evidence that
changes in epigenetic
markers may persist over
the lifetime of an indi-
vidual,” said Professor
Marjo-Riitta Jarvelin,
from Imperial’s School of
Public Health, and who
led the research group.
Smoking during preg-
nancy can lead to prema-
ture birth and low birth
weight, as well as predis-
posing the child to higher
risk for cardio-metabolic
risk factors in later life.
But the exact mecha-
nisms underlying these
longer-term effects were
unclear.
Yet despite the known
risks, it is estimated 53%
of women who smoke
daily continue to smoke
during pregnancy.
Professor Jarvelin
added: “These findings
are important for health
policy makers to further
draw attention towards
increasing awareness
on smoking cessation
programs and for better
prevention strategies in
maternity clinics and
health centres.”
Her team focused on
methylation of a gene
called GFI1, known to be
linked with smoking.
Using data from 22
population-based studies
from Europe, the US
and Australia, the team
looked at the link between
maternal smoking and
epigenetic changes in a
number of regions of the
gene.
They identified lower
DNA methylation of GFI1
in those who smoked or
whose mother smoked

range of health conditions
in adulthood, including
diabetes, heart disease and
stroke.
Priyanka Parmar from
the University of Oulu,
said: “Such epigenetic
loci might serve as ob-
jective biomarkers of past
environmental exposures
that could be used for pre-
ventive health measures.
This discovery provides
a strong foundation for
further work to unravel
emerging smoking
epigenetic markers with
downstream detrimental
health outcomes.”
Cigarette smoking
accounts for an estimated
six million deaths each
year and even former
smokers are at long-term
risk of cardiovascular
diseases, lung cancer and
stroke.
The study highlights
an underlying epigenetic
component for maternal
smoking exposure and
disease risk. But the size
of the effect is unclear.
The team now
hopes to explore more
genetic regions linked
with maternal smoking
exposure and disease risk.
Their work focused on
just six genetic markers
out of a potential 6,000.

Known as ‘epigenetic
tags’ these changes can
lead to obesity, cardiovas-
cular disease, diabetes and
cancer.
The study, led by sci-
entists at Imperial College
London and the Univer-
sity of Oulu in Finland,
analysed data from more
than 18,000 people across
the world – including the
UK, US and Australia.
