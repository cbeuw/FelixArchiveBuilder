The last domino to fall
One of the last countries in the European Union to not fall victim to the rise of far right parties
has joined the club with the rise of the new party Vox.

A
mongst the
seemingly ever
rising far right
movement in
Europe, despite all the
tumultuous events that
have been occurring in
Spain recently, the rise
of an extreme right party
was not something that
Spanish and European
citizens predicted as hap-
pening anytime soon. And
yet nonetheless, Vox was
the first party to do so.
Sending shockwaves
across the country, the
elections in Andalucia
were the first elections in
which Vox managed to
secure their first members
of parliament. Although
the left-wing PSOE was
the most voted party,
an alliance between the
right-wing party currently
in power (PP) and Vox,
meant that Andalucia was
governed by a right-wing
alliance for the first time
in 36 years.
But in what does Vox
believe? And more impor-
tantly, why are Spanish
citizens voting for them?
As one would do to find
out more about this new
party’s proposals, I began
reading through its official
electoral program. What
I read truly worried me.
Although it is not unusual
for political parties to con-
tradict themselves these
days, these claims were
at points so contradictory
it was almost amusing, if
it weren’t for the fact that
their aim is to actually
govern Spain. Their
program is summed into
100 short bullet points,
which they market as their
new proposal to “make
Spain alive”.
Immediately their first
point is to take a jab at
the Catalan government,
calling their attempt at a
referendum a putsch and
the politicians putschists.
Interesting choice of
words that I will not
delve into. To solve the
undeniable divide that
exists between Catalans
and the rest of the Spanish
citizens, they proposed to
remove the current federal
government that has been
in place since the signing
of the Spanish Consti-
tution of 1978. There is
no hint at dialogue to try
to understand where the
discontent in Cataluña is
coming from, and instead,
their solution is, well,
you can’t have conflict
between the federal states
if you just get rid of the
federalstates.Oneperhaps
key aspect that might have
missed Vox’s final review
of their program was
that, were it not for the
federal system currently
in place and the federal
elections that are held,
they wouldn’t have gained
any seats in parliament,
so it was quite baffling to
read a proposal aimed to
eliminate the very same
system that allowed them
to even be on the map in
the first place.
Another eye-catching
proposal was the reclaim-
ing of Gibraltar. Why, I
hear you say? The reason
is uncertain, but what is
for sure is that the general
secretary of Vox, Jose
Ortega, can tell you all
about his great odyssey in
2016, when he swam, yes
you read correctly, swam,
all the way to Gibraltar,
and climbed to the top
of a mountain to place a
Spanish flag on its peak. In
fact, he recounts this great
epic in such a theatrical
way that its almost hard
to believe that he’s being
serious. If you feel like
grabbing some popcorn
and hearing the tale of this
great Spanish hero, please
don’t hesitate to read his
interviews on the incident.
Truly some great content.
On a much more
serious note, they
followed on with the
immediate derogation
of the law of “Historic
Memory”. This was a
law put in place to allow
victims of persecution in
the past to be recognised.
Amongst its measures, it
allowed their relatives to
petition for their bodies
to be buried with decency
by retrieving them from
mass graves, it prohibited
public symbolism of
Franco’s fascist dictator-
ship and recognised that
sentences under Franco’s
regime were unjust
and prejudiced against
non-fascists.
ButVoxisawell-round-
ed party, not only drawing
inspiration from the
fascist past, but also
keeping up to date with
Trump-ist latest tenden-
cies. Apparently in Vox’s
eyes, it is also imperative
to raise an uncrossable
wall between Ceuta and
Melilla (Spanish cities
in north Africa) and
Morocco.
In regards to their
immigration policies,
their proposals include
prohibiting immigrants
from ever obtaining legal
status in Spain were he or
she to enter the country
irregularly, for life. This
means that any immigrant
entering the country, for
example in a dinghy,
would never be able to
settle in the country, or
receive any sort of help,
including medical help.
This effectively means
that hot returns would
not be illegal. Hot returns
is a term describing the
Strongly reminiscent of
the Emergency Quota Act
of 1921 in the States, their
proposal would prioritise
Spanish speaking immi-
grants and immigrants
from countries with ties to
Spain over other countries
of origins and establish
tight quotas on other na-
tionalities.
The final questionable
proposal on the topic
under this section was the
urge to publish all data on
nationality and origin re-
garding statistics of crime
in Spain. Under the 14th
article of the Spanish con-
stitution, all citizens have
the right to no discrimi-
nation, so publishing this
data would not only be a
violation of privacy, but
also an attempt to scape-
goat different nationalities
of people living in Spain
by portraying them as
criminals.
Reading through their
100 points for a more
renovated Spain, all I saw
was a perfect recipe for a
backwards, xenophobic
country, much like the one
we had during Franco’s
dictatorship. Why would
anyone vote for these
reforms? Is it that easy for
us to forget how damaging
it was for Spain when the
outlook was extremism,
black and white division
and complete disregard
for dialogue? Are we sure
we really want history to
repeat itself in that way?
What is certain is that
no attempts to derogate
our historic memory will
definitely not erase the
mistakes of our fascist
past, and I would much
rather learn from them
than to repeat them.

practise of returning im-
migrants without carrying
out the legally established
procedures or meeting the
internationally acknowl-
edged guarantees to their
country of origin. Images,
witnesses and other
numerous sources with
evidential value accredit
such practices in the cities
of Ceuta and Melilla and
the small islands under
Spanish sovereignty. It is
a practise that has been
deemed illegal by both
European Court of Human
Rights and the United
Nations.
But perhaps the
most worrying measure
proposed on the topic of
immigration, is the notion
of nationality quotas.
