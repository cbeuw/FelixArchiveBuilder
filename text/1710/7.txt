Facing the facts: Botulinum toxin in aesthetic medicine

P
ick up a glossy
magazine to check
out the latest
gossip around
your favourite Hollywood
A-list celebrity, and you
may notice that many
of them have seemingly
flawless faces, lacking the
frown lines and crow’s
feet that you might expect
to see in someone of
their age. Sometimes this
is down to airbrushing
and photo-editing, but
sometimes this can be
because the celebrity has
had a cosmetic treatment,
such as botulinum toxin
injection.
Botulinum toxin works
by disrupting the normal
release of acetylcholine in
motor neurons, resulting
in a temporary flaccid
muscle paralysis. Normal
release of acetylcholine
at the neuromuscular
junction is mediated by a
synaptic fusion complex,
which is made up of a
set of proteins known as
SNARE proteins. After
membrane fusion, acetyl-
choline is released into
the synaptic cleft and then
bound by receptors on the
muscle cell. Botulinum
toxin cleaves the SNARE
proteins, disrupting the
assembly of the synaptic
fusion complex, and
thereby blocking achetyl-
choline release.
Several clinical trials
have been conducted
on botulinum toxin for
aesthetic use, mainly for
frown lines and crow’s
feet. Botulinum toxin
is also used for lateral
eyebrow lifts, ‘bunny
lines’, and ‘gummy
smile’, among others.
Much of the safe use of
botulinum toxin is based
on the physician’s injec-
tion technique, which is
often personal and based
on clinical experience

– incorrect injection tech-
nique can cause problems
such as eyelid ptosis (a
drooping eyelid).
Botulinum toxin has
medical and therapeutic
uses outside of aesthetics,
including muscle spas-
ticity, strabismus, and
improper eye alignment.
Many types and brands
of botulinum toxin are
now available in several
countries worldwide.
People have a range of
psychological, cultural
and social reasons for
choosing botulinum toxin
as an aesthetic treatment,
in our increasingly im-
age-conscious world.

With more than 3.5 million botulinum toxin procedures worldwide in 2014, the global botulinum toxin market is
currently worth £3 billion and is expected to grow 7.2% each year
