May’s Brexit deal voted down by calamitous
margin
Theresa May’s deal has been soundly rejected by Parliament. She has wilfully plunged this
country into crisis.

T
heresa May lost
the vote on her
Withdrawal deal
by 230 votes, and
she only has herself to
blame. This defeat was an
inevitable consequence of
the incompetent way she
has handled Brexit.
Theresa May’s
problems are profound
and difficult to solve but
she gave herself no chance
at all by her approach to
Brexit. She has consist-
ently treated Brexit as an
exercise in party manage-
ment between the Brex-
iteers and her pro-remain
MPs rather than as the
defining issue of the day.
This was never going to
work, and any deal would
have required some level
of cross-party support
to pass the House of
Commons. Theresa May
has the sublime ability to
pretend and act as if she
has a massive majority
when this is simply not
the case. The numbers are
simply not in her favour,
and she should have spent
this time reaching con-
sensus within Parliament
for a deal that she could
have then taken to the EU
as the starting point for
negotiations. This is not
new information, as this
has been evident since her
botched 2017 election.
This approach is un-
acceptable to fanatical
Brexiteers, but their
power is overstated. They
didn’t have the numbers
to topple Theresa May in
a vote of no confidence in
her as leader of the party,
and they certainly would
be powerless in the face of
cross-party support for a
deal. The one move these
Tory Brexiteers have left
is to leave the party and
vote against her in a vote
of no confidence. What
would happen afterwards
though?Ageneral election
where they wouldn’t stand
a chance of winning and
the outcome would be
in all likelihood a softer
Brexit. The only reason
the Brexiteers are happy
at this point is because if
Parliament cannot agree
on anything then the
UK leaves on no deal
terms. This is a game of
high stakes poker, but
ultimately the Brexiteers
will lose with remain MPs
also prepared to go to
extraordinary lengths to
prevent a no deal Brexit.
If the rest of Parliament is
able to work together then
the Brexiteer cause will be
dead in the water.
What the country needs
is a Prime Minister with
the confidence to stand
against those in her own
party who are Brexit
ideologues who would in
all likelihood be unhappy
with any deal. Doing so
even at the risk of splitting
the Conservative party.
This kind of split would
be the first of its kind since
Peel in the 19th century,
but the Conservative
party survived and would
ultimately survive another
split. This reckoning has
been on the horizon since
Brexit happened. Time
and time again rather
than facing this head on,
May has dithered, wasted
time and kicked the can
down the road, putting
the interests of her party
ahead of the country. She
has been the architect of
the constitutional crisis
between Parliament and
the government. MPs have
resorted to Parliamentary
guerrilla warfare, passing
motions and amendments
to seize control from the
government over Brexit in
the absence of any leader-
ship or solutions from the
government. Our system
was never designed for
this.
It’s promising that
Theresa May has agreed
to meet with the leaders
of other parties to find a
way forward and signals
that she may compromise
towards a soft Brexit,
highlighting the waste
of time everything up
to this point. Given that
other leaders have met
with Theresa May, it’s
disappointing that Corbyn
has so far not taken part in
these meetings. It would
appear to be solely a
political decision to avoid
making any tough deci-
sions himself and to not
appear to be supporting
the government and the
Conservatives. May will
need to give up several of
whether to back a second
referendum and deliver
a Brexit that would be
most palatable to his party
members. Once Brexit
happens, things may well
become easier for Corbyn.
Pro-EU Labour members
and MPs will gain far
less traction in calls for a
second referendum with
the wider public once
the issue appears settled.
Corbyn can then focus on
his attention on bashing
the Tories over cuts and
the NHS, certainly more
natural territory for him.
Brexit has been fasci-
nating to follow and will
continue to deliver. We
are entering a new stage of
this process, and anyone
would be a fool for confi-
dently calling the outcome
now. Any one of no deal,
a referendum or a new
deal could still happen. A
referendum feels unlikely
as it will not happen with
May as Prime Minister
and if one thing has been
consistent over the last
few years is her steadfast-
ness. No deal shouldn’t
happen if Parliament gets
its act together aided by
the Speaker leaving some
kind of soft deal as the
most likely outcome.

By taking part in the talks
Labour and the other

a much better chance of

towards a soft Brexit with
a customs union. This
