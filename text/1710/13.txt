Ronal Roy
Humphrey returns to
his dressing room, still
dressed in bright dress
and impressive wig. He’s
as loud and as flamboyant
as you would expect from
a panto star. But there’s
more beneath the surface
for Roy. Faced with aging
and the inevitable changes
facing his beloved art-
form, he’s a man hiding
tremendous emotion
behind the façade of his
bright yellow gown. In a
well timed follow-up to
the Christmas pantomime
season, The Dame opens
up a bleaker take on this
cheerful Christmas staple.
Writer Katie Duncan
starts off with what would
already be rich material
for exploration. Roy is
facing the lack of rele-
vance that has come with
both age and the decline
of pantomime, alongside
the death of the British
seaside town that had
been the traditional stage
for pantomime. Surely,
there’s more than enough
here for a 70 minute
performance. But halfway
through, we switch focus.
It becomes clear that
Roy also has a troubled
childhood past. An
abusive father and a child
shielded by a vulnerable,
but ever so loving mother.
Perhaps it’s cold to be so
dismissive of such clear
sentimental bait, but it
feels like Duncan has just
taken a generic ‘sad child-
hood’and added it into the
mixing pot, almost as a
cheap cheat for emotional
depth.
The script also has a
strong tendency towards
hyperbole and the mel-
odramatic, and to an
extent that works. Our
titular character is, after
all, a pantomime dame
looking back on his glory
days – a certain flair for
the dramatic is to be
expected. But Duncan’s
writing fails to rein in her
words when she takes Roy
from stage performer to
confused child, with her
overly lyrical wording
destroying any hope of
actual immersion in Roy’s
past.
The play is almost
saved by Peter Duncan.
The former Blue Peter
presenter delivers a strong
performance as Roy,
alternating between exu-
berant pantomime dame,
and troubled man. The
performance is almost a
showcase of his versatility
as he easily transitions
from one to the other.
However, even he cannot
fully salvage this confused
piece. Roy as a character
lacks the genuine heart
needed to really come to
life and as a result, we are
left with a performance
that somehow rings false.
London’s Fringe theatre
scene is full of talented
writers, and it’s all too fre-
quently that I find myself
watching a lacklustre
production of a great
piece. It’s almost more
frustrating that The Dame
is the exact opposite. The
Park Theatre’s lovely
intimate space, simple yet
effective set and most of
all, Peter Duncan’s strong
acting talents are wasted
on this confused piece.
Obscure Shakespeare receives a fun new revival
T
he comedy
centres around
the lascivious
Sir John Falstaff,
known to many from
Shakespeare’s Henry IV
plays – The Merry Wives
of Windsor is said to have
been commissioned by
Elizabeth I herself, who
must have felt her beloved
Falstaff deserving of his
own story. This play uses
this fact as a means of in-
troducing the characters,
as in the beginning they
come in one-by-one with
their names projected onto
the background – I found
this immensely helpful in
keeping track throughout
the play due to the many
characters.
In classic Shakespeare
style, the story at times
feels like there’s a bit too
much to keep up with,
with bizarre sub-plots
including marrying off the
young Anne Page, a con-
fusing dispute between a
Welsh person and French
doctor, a jealous husband
posing as ‘Master Brook’
to trick Falstaff, and the
involvement of Falstaff’s
servants in his downfall.
However, the main story is
ultimately that of Falstaff
being the subject of Mis-
tresses Ford and Page’s
schemes – and rightly so,
as Falstaff is attempting to
womanise them simulta-
neously (owing to his debt
and need for money).
Little does he know
they’ve been tipped off –
and boy do they have a lot
in store for him. And so
the hilarity ensues, as they
repeatedly ruin Falstaff’s
foolish attempts to seduce
them. The standout
performances were those
of the titular characters,
Mistresses Ford and Page
(Beth Cordingly and
Rebecca Lacey). There
was such incredible and
succinct repartee between
them, and every scene
they had together lit up
the stage with flawless
comedic timing.
David Troughton, a
veteran Royal Shake-
speare Company actor,
also commands the stage
in every scene he appears
in, perfectly depicting
a lecherous and loud
Falstaff, and as expected,
nails every bit of verse he
has. Naturally then, the
best scenes were the ones
with all three of these
characters, and there was
some fantastic physical
comedy alongside the
banter – notably the scene
where Falstaff manages to
get himself into a wheelie
bin to hide from Ford.
The costumes and
set design – a weird,
never-before-seen mix
of Tudor and Essex, with
neon and glitter amok –
were fantastic, and the
strange dance scenes at the
beginning and end only
added to the quirkiness
of the whole play. There
was never a dull moment;
there’s humour for even
those who typically don’t
understand Shakespeare’s
jokes. Fiona Laird has
taken one of Shake-
speare’s often overlooked
plays and adapted it for a
fun, silly evening for all.
